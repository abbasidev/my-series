1
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:40,497
The old heated doorknob. Nice try.

2
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:44,001
Lester, you still giving me
the silent treatment?

3
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:52,426
- Okay. Everybody, good morning.
- Good morning. Your coffee, sir.

4
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,303
Why, Jeffrey, thank you so much.

5
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,808
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

6
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:04,688
You know, call me old-fashioned,
but I just-- I prefer cream over laxative.

7
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,232
Heh.

8
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,402
I need everybody's attention.
I know some of you are unhappy...

9
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,613
...I'm running the Buy More. I'm sorry.

10
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:17,409
But all your little tricks
and your tactics, I know them all.

11
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:21,705
I taught you them. So listen up.
No more sabotage.

12
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,458
Thank you. Lester, you're in my chair.

13
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,128
There's one thing I learned in Hawaii,
it's that I'm good at this.

14
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:30,130
I am good at the Buy More.

15
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,099
Do me a favor and grab Chuck for me?

16
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,851
Can somebody grab Chuck for me?

17
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:46,355
Hey, Jeff, can you send Chuck back here
for me? Chuck!

18
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:49,233
Casey, I wanna ask you
about a beastmaster.

19
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,985
- Really?
- No, not really.

20
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:56,073
Hey. Have we got any more info
on you-know-who down in Castle?

21
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,908
- Shaw?
- Yeah. Yeah. Shaw.

22
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:00,953
I'm busy. Why don't you talk to him?
He's living there.

23
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,039
Living in Castle? What? What?
Casey, what's going on?

24
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:09,336
- Is he really in charge of our team?
- Shaw is a special agent with the CIA.

25
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,380
He can do pretty much
whatever he wants.

26
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,882
- Even more special than me?
- It gets worse.

27
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,302
Whenever a special agent takes over,
they conduct a review.

28
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,929
Sarah's in there with him now.

29
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,973
What do you think they're talking about?

30
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:25,269
- Is Chuck Bartowski a real spy?
- Yes. Of course he is.

31
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:30,774
I mean, his training has been irregular,
and he was a civilian only two years ago.

32
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,568
Reports tell a different story.

33
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:35,821
Sometimes he sounds like Bond,
other times, a Jerry Lewis movie.

34
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,031
I need to know, is Chuck a liability?

35
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:41,493
Wait, the review's about me?
Shouldn't Shaw be asking me about me?

36
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,036
Where's the fun in that?

37
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:47,583
Look, I am never gonna be able to escape
this ridiculous cover...

38
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,918
...if Shaw thinks
I'm some moron-civilian...

39
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:53,046
...who got unlucky to get a computer
dumped into his head.

40
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,799
- Okay, here we go. Here we go.
- What?

41
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:59,595
- Help.
- Morgan, did you get glued to a chair?

42
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:03,432
Yes. Yes, I did, okay? The whole store's
coming after me, dude.

43
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,226
Lester went mute
and refuses to talk to me.

44
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,769
Maybe because you fired him?

45
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:11,064
No, no. They've teamed up
and formed an evil cabal of tricksters.

46
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,985
I haven't had an untainted cup of coffee
in days. I need my free coffee.

47
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:18,238
Give me five minutes running
this Popsicle stand, we'd be ready.

48
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:19,740
What? Ready for what?

49
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,326
The Russians.

50
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,580
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Little help.

51
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,290
Is that--? Is that Shaw? Listen.

52
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:32,753
I am an integral member of this team, okay?
My voice should be heard.

53
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,714
Your prepubescent girl screams
are gonna be duly noted.

54
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,966
Actually, right now, he wants to see you.

55
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,809
Shaw, I'm certain
that things have been said...

56
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:50,479
...about either myself
or my abilities as a spy.

57
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,899
While I concede there are more
traditional or professional spies--

58
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,068
Chuck, this is my meeting.

59
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,613
Right. Sorry. Please continue.

60
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:04,493
I think we can all agree this team has
been dysfunctional the last two years.

61
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:09,289
And I think I know what the problem is.
The problem is them.

62
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:12,251
- What? What does that mean?
- Means he's a moron.

63
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:16,129
They coddle you. You could be
a great spy, but they won't let you evolve.

64
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:17,589
Really?

65
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,800
I mean, yes. Yes, really. He's right.

66
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,636
Let me be a spy. Let me out of the car.
I'm ready.

67
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,346
No, Shaw. He's not.

68
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,598
Duly noted and ignored.

69
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,352
Chuck, you're going
on your first solo mission.

70
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,146
Undercover. In Paris. Are you ready?

71
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,445
Absolutely.

72
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:25,574
- Um, so, what are we doing here, exactly?
- Your Intersect skills can be glitchy.

73
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:29,161
You'll need some basic spy craft
for this mission.

74
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,331
- Have you ever used one of these?
- A pen?

75
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,083
- KGB-model tranq pen.
- Oh, yeah. Casey's got one of these.

76
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:40,213
Aim it at your target's food or drink
and it's bedtime for bad guy.

77
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,594
You want me to tranq Jeff?
I can't do that.

78
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,263
I've read everyone's file.
Jeff Barnes will be fine.

79
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:52,267
- Come on, Chuck, you up for this?
- Yeah.

80
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,938
Hey, Jeffrey Jeff.
How's it hanging, brother?

81
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,482
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

82
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,983
Um...

83
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:01,985
What do you mean, okay?

84
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,488
What are you doing?

85
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:07,115
You don't usually check up on me
like this.

86
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:11,286
- Did I do something wrong?
- No, no, no, buddy. Everything's fine.

87
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:15,749
You're fine. Work's fine, you know.
This is more of a checking in.

88
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,709
Just making sure you're feeling okay.

89
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:22,881
Just a little human-to-humanoid
interaction, so...

90
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,302
- Good.
- Thanks, yeah.

91
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:30,389
A bit of a rocky start,
but I finished strong. What's next?

92
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:35,143
- Let's go. You're ready.
- What? Whoa, I am?

93
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,770
I'm ready after 20 seconds?

94
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:40,232
After two years. I just wanted
to talk to you privately, Chuck.

95
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,985
You've been on more missions
than most spies have been in a lifetime.

96
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:46,988
Trust me, you're ready.

97
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,457
Freshly brewed, untouched by Jeff's lips.

98
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,419
Checkmate, Lester. Checkmate.

99
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:05,257
As assistant manager,
I claim this cup of coffee for me.

100
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,842
Mm...

101
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:10,345
Okay. That's what I'm talk--
You guys gotta understand something.

102
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,556
You gotta get up pretty early to get ol--

103
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,685
The CIA contact will meet you in Paris.

104
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:20,188
You're traveling as Carmichael,
a successful businessman.

105
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:23,859
- Itinerary and passport.
- Guys, it's all good. I'm ready, okay?

106
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,697
- What are these?
- Nunchucks.

107
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,703
You know very well
that I don't like carrying guns around.

108
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,122
But I thought it wouldn't be
such a bad idea...

109
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,458
...to have some kind of offensive weapon.

110
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,502
You know, just to have with me,
just in case.

111
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,297
And they're supposed to be
in the Intersect, so...

112
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,883
- Casey, can I have a second?
- Yeah.

113
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,891
Listen, I know you want this to work
and you wanna impress Shaw.

114
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,184
But this is crazy.

115
00:07:57,351 --> 00:08:00,228
Nunchucks are crazy.
You weren't supposed to see those.

116
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:04,065
But Shaw, an honest-to-God,
real-life special agent for the CIA...

117
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,400
...thinks that I'm ready.

118
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:10,155
He thinks I can do it, and I wanna prove
he's not wrong about me.

119
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,158
I'm not saying
that you can't do this, but...

120
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:18,914
Please. Please, just don't go now, okay?
You need more time.

121
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:24,169
He's going. Beckman agrees with me.

122
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,755
We've set up a subnetwork
on your phone.

123
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,841
You'll be able to text and call
from the plane.

124
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,552
Your ticket.
And your car is waiting outside.

125
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,638
You'll receive instructions in Paris.

126
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:38,433
Oh, Daddy! First class. That is--

127
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:45,357
Probably what you do for everybody.
Okay. Well, see you later.

128
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,736
I hope.

129
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,248
Thank you.

130
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:15,595
Thank you.

131
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:18,807
Welcome to first class, sir.
May I take your jacket?

132
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,642
You wanna take my jack--? Yes. Of--

133
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,227
Yes. Sorry about that.

134
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,314
There you go.
Oh, actually, you know what?

135
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:30,735
Let me just get my phone
and writing utensil. Okay.

136
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,243
- Lucky pen?
- Huh?

137
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:39,744
Lucky pen?

138
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:43,582
No. No, just a-- You know,
just a regular old "pen" pen.

139
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,792
- Okay.
- Heh.

140
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,878
Mm...

141
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,339
I'm Chuck. I mean, Charles.

142
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:54,092
I mean, name is Charles,
but my friends call me Chuck.

143
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:58,138
- I'm Hannah. Just Hannah, Chuck.
- Good, that makes it easy.

144
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,348
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

145
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:01,850
Yeah.

146
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:06,354
- May I offer either of you a drink?
- Oh, no.

147
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,440
Know what? I'm on business. Thank you.

148
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,025
Me too. I'll have his.

149
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,652
On second thought, I think I will, then.

150
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:14,654
Thank you.

151
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:15,947
- For you. Uh-huh.
- Thank you.

152
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,366
- Thank you.
- Sure.

153
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:22,537
So, what do you think of our
fellow passengers here in first class?

154
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,625
I'm thinking Syrian dignitaries
over there...

155
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:30,045
...a couple of nuclear physicists.

156
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,881
That bunch, I don't know about them.

157
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,633
That bunch over there?

158
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,886
Yeah, I'm gonna go with Yale
fencing team. Without a doubt.

159
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,555
- Spot on.
- Oh, thanks. Ha, ha.

160
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:45,393
Now, what about you,
Charles-But-My-Friends-Call-Me-Chuck?

161
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,562
Uh...

162
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,773
What about--? What about me? Um...

163
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:53,652
I'm in retail. Very high-end merchandise.

164
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:57,072
At a very prestigious store.

165
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:10,877
What the--?

166
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,838
Come on! Get me out of here!
This is not--!

167
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:18,218
Hey, Casey. Oh, thank you.

168
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:34,943
See that? You see that?
How do you do that?

169
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,237
- You command respect. I--
No.

170
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,614
I take it.

171
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:53,420
- Shaken, not stirred.
- Thank you.

172
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:55,338
You don't fly first class often?

173
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,467
Wha--? No. No, of course I do.
All the time.

174
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:03,304
L.A. to Paris. Paris to L.A.

175
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:04,806
What about you?

176
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,559
Well, I work for a private investor.

177
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:11,312
Essentially, he just flies me around
the world and I fix problems for him.

178
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,566
IT stuff. Computers, mainframes.
It's terribly boring.

179
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:18,236
And stress, a lot stress,
but I get to travel.

180
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,573
And live in Paris.
I have a view of the Eiffel Tower.

181
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:25,160
- No way. Really?
- Yeah. Have you been?

182
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,412
To the Eiffel Tower?
Yeah, so many times.

183
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,374
Can't count how many times. I know
everything there is to know about it.

184
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:36,421
Chuck, what do we think
of Mr. Muscles over there?

185
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:41,301
- Mr. Muscles? Let me take a gander.
- Professional wrestler, maybe.

186
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:54,189
I don't know. Tough to tell. Kind of
non-descript, really. Don't you think?

187
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:56,941
Would you excuse me?
Gotta use the little boy's room.

188
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,818
- Yeah.
- I'll be right back.

189
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,195
- Okay.
- Okay.

190
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:01,696
Here you go.

191
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:07,202
- Hey, you there?
- Chuck, have you flashed yet?

192
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:08,703
How did you know I'd flash?

193
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:13,208
Because your mission's not in Paris,
Chuck. Your mission is on the plane.

194
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,882
What do you mean
my mission is on the plane?

195
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,884
The mission is on the plane?

196
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:26,721
Hugo Panzer, the man you flashed,
is a Ring agent.

197
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,890
He's moving a CIA crypto-key to Paris.

198
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,518
He'll put it in cargo. Get his claim ticket...

199
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:34,854
...go to the cargo hold, find his bag,
get the key.

200
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:38,358
Yeah, I'm only seeing problems
with that plan right now.

201
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,568
Hugo Panzer is a bit on the large side.

202
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,695
Chuck, I gave you the pen for a reason.

203
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:43,905
You can do this.

204
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:49,118
The pen. Of course, the pen.
Tranq him, get the ticket.

205
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,538
- No problem.
- Chuck, please be careful.

206
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:55,917
Hugo Panzer is very dangerous.
He is a master at close-quarters combat.

207
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,335
Sarah, don't you worry.

208
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,879
I'll have that key
before they serve the lobster.

209
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:03,925
And by the way,
I'm quite looking forward to that. Hello?

210
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:05,260
Should have told me.

211
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:08,012
- This is why I didn't.
- Chuck's not ready for Paris...

212
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,182
...and certainly not for a mid-air mission.
We can't help him.

213
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,185
Well, now we find out
if your asset is a real spy.

214
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:19,607
Who are you, Agent Shaw? I've never
heard of you and neither has Casey.

215
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:23,778
- You're a very well-kept secret.
- I do like my secrets. Don't you?

216
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,614
Being the daughter of a con man
teaches you that.

217
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:30,451
- You really do read everybody's files.
- Of course. I have questions for you.

218
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,913
Seven months ago,
when Chuck was in Prague...

219
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,040
...you went off-grid for three days.

220
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:39,085
This is a surveillance photo
of a hotel in Lisbon.

221
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,795
This is you.

222
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:45,383
Beckman ordered you to stay in contact,
but you ran. Why?

223
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:47,802
It's not what you think.

224
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:51,806
I don't know what to think. Are you
a double agent? A Ring operative?

225
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,558
Or is this about Chuck?

226
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:00,982
Excuse me. Sorry to bother you.

227
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,318
The woman I'm sitting next to
is a nuisance.

228
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:07,447
Will not shut up. So I was kind of
wondering if I could plop down here...

229
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,198
...if that's okay.

230
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:13,161
- Fine.
- Thanks. Awesome.

231
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,962
You know, I think she's an upgrade.
It's such a bummer too.

232
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,341
One of the things I love about first class
is socializing...

233
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:29,260
...and rubbing elbows with people
that are like-minded.

234
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,095
Not the rabble. Don't you agree?

235
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,978
- Excuse me.
- Oh, yeah, sure. Do your thing.

236
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,163
Crossword time.

237
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:02,460
"One across. Ecru."

238
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,971
- It's the air pressure.
- What? Huh?

239
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,683
Pens don't always work on planes
because of the pressure.

240
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,393
- That's fascinating.
- Let me try.

241
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,228
Oh, no-- Please don't-- Don't--

242
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:25,817
- Sorry. Sorry about that. Sorry.
- That wasn't ink.

243
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:31,239
Ah! Sir, this is first class.

244
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,824
- Who are you?
- Nobody.

245
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,283
Who are you?

246
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,338
KGB.

247
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,105
- Yeah?
- Any updates on Chuck?

248
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,315
Relax, Casey. He's doing fine.

249
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:11,404
Hey, John. Uh, do you have a second?

250
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,823
I need a favor.

251
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:19,245
- Not interested.
- I hate to pull rank here, John...

252
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:22,248
...but I am your superior.

253
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:28,796
- What?
- I need you, okay. Please help me.

254
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:31,716
I don't know what they'll do next.
Lester and his gang.

255
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,385
They've taken over,
set booby traps everywhere.

256
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:35,762
I'm going crazy here.

257
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:39,849
I can't fight them by myself anymore.
They don't follow any rules.

258
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:44,812
Insurgents? I hate insurgents.

259
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,231
Then this'll work out, I think.

260
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:28,481
Hey. Hey, guys. I'm in the cargo hold.
And it's frigging freezing in here.

261
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:32,985
Good job. Look for the matching ticket,
find the key, get back to your seat.

262
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:43,162
Come on.

263
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,664
I'm right, aren't I?

264
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:48,042
I should tell you I'm always right.
It's annoying but true.

265
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,963
Why don't you tell me what you're right
about, so I can tell you're wrong.

266
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,965
My theory about you and Chuck.

267
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,509
Most spies push their assets to perform.

268
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,220
That's what I do. You protect him.

269
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:02,014
You care for him.
And you followed him to Lisbon.

270
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:05,017
- That's not true.
- Come on. I was right about this mission.

271
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:07,979
- And I'm right about you.
- Chuck isn't home free yet.

272
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,264
- What do you got, Chuck?
- I found it. It's a casket.

273
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:46,767
Smart. The Ring knows
that customs won't check the body.

274
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,895
Open it up. Find the key.

275
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,897
- That's disgusting.
- Get it done, Chuck.

276
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,862
Oh!

277
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,283
Hi, sorry about this.

278
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,119
Where are you? Where is it?

279
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:08,956
Oh, dead hands. Dead, cold hands.
Dead cold.

280
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,583
Here we go.

281
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,627
Oh, that's disgusting.

282
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:15,922
God, dead skin, dead skin, dead skin.

283
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,090
Jackpot.

284
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:31,896
- It's Chuck.
- Don't answer.

285
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,315
He's taken care of Hugo.
He has to find the key.

286
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:38,903
- He shouldn't need to call.
- Sarah, pick up. Pick up your phone.

287
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,322
- What if he's in trouble?
- Go ahead. Answer it.

288
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,783
Just know if you do,
he'll never be a real spy.

289
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,826
And one day, that will get him killed.

290
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:57,505
Sorry. Sorry, old man. Sorry, old man.

291
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,183
Don't freak out.

292
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:29,870
Casey? Casey? Listen.
I'm in a little bit of a pickle right now.

293
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:34,667
I am currently trapped in a coffin
with a recently deceased elderly man...

294
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,836
...and a large bad guy trying to find me.

295
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,546
- Aren't you on the plane?
- Right.

296
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:41,549
Yes, I forgot to mention that.
The mission is on the plane.

297
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:46,178
I have the key, but the Ring operative
is right outside. What do I do?

298
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,139
- You get taken.
- What?

299
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:52,560
Agent's gonna find you because
you picked the dumbest place to hide.

300
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,687
Thanks. Criticism is always welcome.

301
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:58,316
When he does, you act like
your girlish self. Scream like a banshee...

302
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,901
...so he doesn't think you're a threat.

303
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:03,529
When he pulls you out,
find a weapon then flash.

304
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:04,822
What if I don't flash?

305
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,657
Then you're dead. So flash.

306
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,743
Casey--

307
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,330
Chuck? Chuck?

308
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,005
- Yeah, Casey?
- Bartowski's in trouble.

309
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:24,467
- The Ring operative has him.
- What? Chuck's been taken.

310
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,261
I'm opening a line to his phone.

311
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,099
I sincerely hope that's not your father.

312
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:38,439
You should have taken my watch.

313
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:41,567
My employer demands
a certain heart rate when I'm on the job.

314
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,110
Got a little present for you.

315
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:53,496
They really are a fencing team.

316
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,584
Why don't you just come here?

317
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,086
I'll do this clean.

318
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:02,254
Easy. No pain.

319
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:06,509
Please be in the Intersect.

320
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:16,894
En garde.

321
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,314
- Point.
- What's the matter?

322
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,400
You know you're gonna die.

323
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,343
You missed. A lot.

324
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:01,188
Chuck? Chuck, what's happening?

325
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:03,774
Hey. Guys, I'm still alive.

326
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,777
And my first solo mission was a success.

327
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:12,491
Buckle up, Buy Morians.
It's gonna be a bumpy ride.

328
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:15,327
Meet my new lieutenant
assistant manager, John Casey.

329
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,622
You guys know John from Appliances.

330
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:22,543
Or maybe you remember him
from the volleyball incident...

331
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,378
...at last year's employee picnic.

332
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:27,506
Either way, for those who are willing
to abandon...

333
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:30,676
...the plot to sabotage me
and my assistant manager-ship...

334
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,678
...you're free to go.

335
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,683
Well, well, well.

336
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:40,144
Lookie what we have here.

337
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:43,022
- This is a no-smoking store.
- Thanks, Jeff.

338
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,900
My lieutenant has a right to smoke a cigar
if he wants to.

339
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:47,693
Or he can put it out.

340
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,737
Mr. Casey.

341
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,075
Anyone else wanna leave?

342
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,624
Anything you gotta say, big guy?

343
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,085
Lester says:

344
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:08,380
- "This isn't over."
- Does he?

345
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,390
Sounds outrageous...

346
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:23,771
...but the Eiffel Tower's most amazing
engineering feat is the elevator itself.

347
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,775
And with that,
I realize I'm the most boring person.

348
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:32,655
No. No, that was an amazing story.
And I really like your model.

349
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:34,281
Thanks.

350
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:36,784
It was a gift from my dad.

351
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,454
Can I ask you a personal question?

352
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,374
Sure.

353
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,668
Have you ever been to Paris, Chuck?

354
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:48,879
Of course.

355
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,464
That's--

356
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:56,887
- No, I haven't.
- It's just that you talked about it...

357
00:25:57,055 --> 00:26:00,307
...with such wonder, like someone
who's always wanted to go.

358
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:04,061
No one in first class ever wants
to do anything that badly.

359
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,730
You're different. You stand out.

360
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:10,818
Thank you.

361
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,738
This is all kind of new to me.
I just wanted to fit in.

362
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,824
Yeah, why?

363
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,284
What's your secret, Chuck?

364
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:25,249
The truth is I work at the Buy More
in Burbank.

365
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,167
You know the--?

366
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,503
In the Nerd Herd department.

367
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:32,089
I did a home theater install
at this guy's house.

368
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,174
And he liked it so much...

369
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:38,345
...that he wanted me to do same thing
in his home in Paris.

370
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,222
So here I am.

371
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,350
His ticket. I'm just along for the ride.

372
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:50,357
I don't really belong in Paris,
or first class, for that matter.

373
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:53,986
That's not true.
Do you wanna know my secret?

374
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,363
Is it scary?

375
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:59,158
No. Um...

376
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:03,037
I just got fired from my job.

377
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:07,124
I thought I had actually convinced them
to let me stay...

378
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:11,337
...but I am now officially flying to Paris
to empty out my office.

379
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:14,673
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

380
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:18,552
Meeting you almost makes it worth it.

381
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,898
Mama?

382
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:49,333
You're not here. You're still sleeping.

383
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,585
You're still in bed.

384
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,587
Just relax.

385
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:56,090
Just watch the red dot.

386
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:01,178
This is your boss.

387
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:04,223
Morgan is your boss.

388
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,017
Morgan is your boss.

389
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,229
Morgan is your boss.

390
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:14,942
Morgan is Lester's boss.

391
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,405
That's right.

392
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:22,282
You're happy that Morgan is your boss.

393
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:25,035
Wait. This Morgan person is real?

394
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,705
- This store you work in, it exists?
- Yeah, yeah.

395
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:31,709
Yes to both of those things,
although I have quite often wondered...

396
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:35,087
...if the Buy More
was really an insane asylum, but yeah.

397
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:41,760
What is it?

398
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,138
Uh...

399
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:47,808
That drink, I don't remember ordering it.

400
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:50,728
I-- It just kind of appeared
out of nowhere.

401
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:53,439
And you drank it.

402
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,568
Are you okay?

403
00:28:57,944 --> 00:28:59,486
Yeah.

404
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:01,655
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine.

405
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:04,992
It just tasted a little funny.

406
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,369
Yeah. You look
like you've been poisoned.

407
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:09,997
That's crazy.

408
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:32,269
- Is something wrong?
- I've just been poisoned.

409
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,646
Someone just poisoned me.
I think it was Hugo.

410
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:37,316
I tied him up in the cargo hold.
Somehow he escaped.

411
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:39,109
- What did it taste like?
- Complex.

412
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:42,237
It had a strong nose with hints of apple,
then a sour finish.

413
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:44,907
- He's right. It's poison.
- You have to throw up.

414
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:47,284
- That's disgusting.
- Just do it right now.

415
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:51,330
Busy. It's Hugo. He is coming for me.

416
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:55,000
Sir, are you okay?
Do you need any help?

417
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:58,337
Sorry. Mexican food.
You do not wanna come in here.

418
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,589
Scream and you're dead.

419
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:04,676
- Chuck?
- I am so writing a letter to the airline...

420
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,553
- ...about this.
- Shut up.

421
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:09,848
There's only one antidote
for that poison and I have it.

422
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:12,309
Now, right now, you're feeling queasy.

423
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:15,979
In an hour, you'll be in more pain
than you could possibly imagine.

424
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:19,066
- Okay, fine. What do you want?
- The key. Now.

425
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:20,692
What key? Oh!

426
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,945
Oh, the key.

427
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:28,200
You have it. I want it. Give it to me.
And don't lie. I'll kill you right here.

428
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:32,746
I have the key, but I don't have it on me.
I hid it down in the cargo hold.

429
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,377
Go on.

430
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,632
Oh, hi.

431
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:48,011
Isn't poisoning me enough?

432
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,349
Now, where is the key?

433
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,725
Antidote first.

434
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,936
- Is this your first mission?
- Maybe.

435
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,982
You led my agent into a mission
with two Ring operatives?

436
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:02,067
- He's going to make it.
- How?

437
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:03,861
Watch.

438
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,821
This is Blackbriar to Crystal Palace.

439
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:07,322
- Do you have me?
- Copy that.

440
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,783
I need to initiate
an executive-office override.

441
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:13,662
Put Sentry Satellite into inverse orbit
over Millennium Atlantic Flight 3923.

442
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,123
- Standing by, 3923 uplink.
- What are you doing?

443
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,253
We launched a satellite designed
to take control of enemy fighters.

444
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:24,798
Surprisingly, the thing actually works.
You're a pilot, right?

445
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:27,676
You're gonna take control of that plane?
That's a 747.

446
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:30,679
I hope you're a quick learner,
Captain Walker.

447
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:41,148
Call Chuck.

448
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:47,279
All right. I work for the CIA. Okay?

449
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,240
And that's my boss.

450
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:53,577
I cannot give up the key
without his authorization first.

451
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,288
Answer it. On speaker.

452
00:31:58,833 --> 00:31:59,917
Hi, guys.

453
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,544
If you're wondering, I'm doing just dandy.

454
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:07,090
Aside from being captured, poisoned
and repeatedly socked in the gut.

455
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:08,342
I have your agent.

456
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:10,886
- Order him to give me the key.
- Who is this?

457
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:14,431
I work for a third party,
and my employer doesn't tolerate failure.

458
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:17,225
Now, your man--

459
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:20,604
Oh, Chuck. Seat 2B.

460
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:23,565
Chuck here will be dead in an hour.

461
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:26,151
But I'm in a rush.
So he gives me the key...

462
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,528
- ...or I kill him now.
- Okay.

463
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:32,699
- Okay?
- Did he say--? Did you just say--?

464
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:37,579
I think you meant to say,
"Please don't kill my good friend Chuck."

465
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:40,499
Before you shoot him,
what type of poison are you using?

466
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:43,502
I'm not bluffing. This is a cyanide hybrid.

467
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:47,089
- Cyanide hybrid.
- You've used it before. In Berlin.

468
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:49,591
- What?
- Serena.

469
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:52,636
You used that same poison
to take out the Syrian ambassador.

470
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,846
And I know you work for The Ring.

471
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:56,974
How do you know this?

472
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,226
Don't worry about that. Do what I say.

473
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:02,479
Give my agent the antidote.
I'll let you and your gorilla slide.

474
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:05,065
- Who are you?
- Serena, you can do this.

475
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:09,820
- Let him go.
- I can't. You know my employer.

476
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:13,699
Your agent is alone
and he's going to die.

477
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:16,493
No. My people are never alone.

478
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,370
Now.

479
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:23,417
Disengaging yaw damper.

480
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,214
Inducing negative G's.

481
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:42,728
Good evening.
We've run into a patch of turbulence.

482
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:45,564
Please return to your seats right now.

483
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:54,406
You shot a gun on a plane!
Are you crazy?

484
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:19,806
- Sarah, level off the plane now!
- Got it.

485
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:49,377
Hey. I'm alive and I have the key.

486
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,507
Unfortunately, I did not get to use
my nunchucks.

487
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,303
This is Blackbriar to Crystal Palace.

488
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:00,180
- Disable link on my mark.
- Copy that.

489
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,432
Three, two, one, break.

490
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,685
- Uplink terminated.
- Thank you, Palace.

491
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:08,897
Well, the flight crew
will never even know we were there.

492
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:11,399
Just another day in the office.

493
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:17,030
I do everything I can
to protect my people.

494
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:19,324
I lost one spy.

495
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:21,076
It was my fault.

496
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:22,744
And it will never happen again.

497
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:27,541
Why were you in Lisbon?

498
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:34,381
I went to bury Bryce, my partner.

499
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:37,884
He wanted his ashes there.

500
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:41,763
Lisbon was our first mission.
I knew I wasn't supposed to leave...

501
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:45,350
...but I promised him
that I would take care of it, so I did.

502
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:51,731
If you want me out, just tell Beckman
and she will reassign me.

503
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:53,567
Why would I do that?

504
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:54,776
I need you.

505
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:57,445
I just had to be sure
The Ring hadn't gotten to you.

506
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:58,905
And now do you believe me?

507
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:01,158
Every word, Sarah.

508
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:11,251
Welcome to Paris, Charles de Gaulle.

509
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,088
So how are you feeling?

510
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:19,426
I'm much better. Thanks.
Sorry about the airsickness episode.

511
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:22,262
- It wasn't my finest hour.
- No, that's okay.

512
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:25,182
I'm gonna be here
for a couple of days clearing things up.

513
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:28,643
I would love it if I could show off
the Eiffel Tower to you.

514
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:30,103
What do you say?

515
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:33,481
- Absolutely. That would be amazing.
- Great.

516
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,199
- Hello?
- Our Paris station has taken custody...

517
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:44,910
...of the Ring operatives.
They send compliments.

518
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:47,120
- Fantastic. Great news.
- Another thing.

519
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:51,333
Stay on the plane.
I need that key back in Burbank ASAP.

520
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:52,959
Uh...

521
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,295
Yeah. Really? I can't--?

522
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,505
Mission's over, Chuck.
Time to come home.

523
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:02,969
What is it?

524
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:07,390
The install job I was gonna do
here in Paris has been canceled...

525
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:09,851
...so Buy More
needs me back immediately.

526
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:11,645
I have to stay on the plane.

527
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:15,357
- But what about Paris?
- Don't worry about it. It's no big deal.

528
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:19,653
I'll get back here eventually.
And furthermore...

529
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:24,032
Hannah...

530
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:28,328
...if you ever find yourself in Burbank,
I don't know what the chances are...

531
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:31,748
...but if you do find yourself in Burbank
still without a job...

532
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:36,086
...my assistant manager owes me
about a million and a half favors.

533
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:40,048
Although I have to warn you, you will be
terribly overqualified for the job.

534
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:44,761
- Thank you.
- Oh, you're welcome.

535
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:49,015
It was a pleasure to meet you, Hannah.

536
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:51,268
It was great to meet you too, Chuck.

537
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,396
Bye.

538
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:32,559
Lester. Dude...

539
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:34,269
...what are we going to do?

540
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:39,899
About Morgan and his new goon?

541
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:42,110
- Morgan?
- Yeah.

542
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:44,070
How are we going to get back at him?

543
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:48,658
Morgan is the kindest, warmest,
most understanding human being...

544
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:51,036
...I've ever known in my life.

545
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,045
Wow, that is too cool.

546
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:01,838
- How did you do that?
- Don't ask.

547
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:04,299
Plausible deniability.

548
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:08,928
Plausible deniability.
Yeah, of course. Of course.

549
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:10,764
Your key, sir.

550
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:13,141
Very good, Chuck.
Your first solo mission.

551
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:15,560
- I am impressed.
- Well, thank you.

552
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:18,063
But I would be dead
if it wasn't for you guys.

553
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:22,692
All right.
Who wants to see if this key works?

554
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:31,993
What is it? A weapon?

555
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:33,870
No. It's a lockbox.

556
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,832
Belonged to a spy I had inside The Ring.
It's all of the intel the agent had.

557
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:53,807
With this, we might stand a chance.

558
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,143
And one of our best didn't die in vain.

559
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,207
What's in the envelope, Shaw?

560
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:40,395
She was killed by a Ring agent
five years ago.

561
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:43,523
Her name was Evelyn Shaw.

562
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:44,732
Eve.

563
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:49,195
We both made the same mistake, Sarah.

564
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:51,531
We fell in love with spies.

565
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,392
What's with the looks?

566
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:21,227
He gave me a raise.

567
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:24,606
Inflation. See what happens
when you go away for a two-day install?

568
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:27,108
- Everything changes.
- I don't know.

569
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:30,111
Sometimes I think
everything just stays the same.

570
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:31,488
But maybe that's just me.

571
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,907
Chuck, what happened on the install?

572
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:36,284
Nothing, buddy.

573
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,244
Nothing at all.

574
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:40,079
Bored now.

575
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:44,959
This guy...
