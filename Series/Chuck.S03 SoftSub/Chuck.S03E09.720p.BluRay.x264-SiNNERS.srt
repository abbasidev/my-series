1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:05,254
Hey, I'm Chuck. Here's a couple
of things you need to know or forgot.

2
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:09,216
Hannah, there are things in my life
that you can't understand.

3
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:10,634
So I have to end this.

4
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,179
- We need to talk.
- Not a good time.

5
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:18,308
You suggesting Chuck is caught in a big,
giant web of conspiracy and deception?

6
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,728
I'm gonna have to lie.
Can't do that anymore.

7
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:23,313
From now on, if Ellie asks,
say, "I don't know."

8
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,232
You two got it bad for this blond.

9
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:30,654
It's about keeping his emotions in check,
so the Intersect can work.

10
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,114
Flash, come on.

11
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:38,746
You and Casey were right, I don't work.
My emotions just mess everything up.

12
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,545
Hey, guys, I got your call.

13
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:48,130
What's...?

14
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,052
- What's going on?
- You're the Intersect, you tell us.

15
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:58,265
The Ring is planning to turn
and use a CIA agent against us.

16
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,976
The problem is,
we don't know who, when or where.

17
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:03,312
The Intersect should have something.

18
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:06,356
Did you flash?

19
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:09,318
Yeah, not... Not flashing.

20
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:12,988
You haven't in a week, ever since Rafe
tried to kill Sarah and me.

21
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,032
- That's a problem.
- Problem?

22
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,034
Really, problem?
Kind of a strong word.

23
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:20,329
- Because a guy had off nights?
- Off nights get agents killed.

24
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:24,333
Figure this out, Intersect's not working.
I can't risk you out in the field.

25
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:27,169
Okay, so, what exactly are you saying?

26
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:31,090
I'm saying until you start flashing again,
you're no longer a spy.

27
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:34,259
No, no, no, you can't...

28
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:35,594
You can't do that.

29
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:39,056
Being a spy is all that I have.
I gave up everything for this.

30
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:42,351
Maybe some time off will do you good,
help you function again.

31
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:47,022
I don't need time off. I'm not flashing
because I have emotions bottled up.

32
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,525
Ever thought that?
I just broke up with Hannah.

33
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:53,779
I can't talk to my best friend or sister
about anything. I'm not a machine.

34
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,406
Okay, I am a machine,
but I'm also a person.

35
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,409
Well, you can always talk to us.

36
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:07,960
Yeah, uh, no thanks.
I don't think that's gonna work for me.

37
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:13,549
Well, find something that does work.
Because until you do, you're benched.

38
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:23,475
This getaway was a perfect idea.

39
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,644
- It's just what we needed.
- You said it.

40
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:29,356
I can't tell you how awesome it feels
to be alone, just the two of us.

41
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:34,736
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

42
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,240
I'll be just a sec.

43
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,870
- Hey, Chuck.
- Awesome, thank God you picked up.

44
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,997
- Everything okay, Chuck?
- No, not really.

45
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,791
I broke up with Hannah.
Sarah's falling for another guy.

46
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,751
Not only is my personal life a mess.

47
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,253
- But my spy life--
Chuck.

48
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:54,173
I went on vacation to get away
from your spy life, okay?

49
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,758
- And to fix things with Ellie.
- No, Devon, Devon.

50
00:02:56,968 --> 00:03:00,596
- Devon, I don't have anyone to talk to.
- I'm sorry, bro.

51
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:03,682
Remember what you said
about discussing your spy life?

52
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,601
I don't know.

53
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:13,108
I say he can get it in there, but I agree
with you, it seems impossible.

54
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,444
So put your wagers in.
Put your wage...

55
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:18,614
You are going to win this.
What do you got in your pockets?

56
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:21,325
Charles Irving Bartowski, please report to...

57
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:24,703
...the assistant manager's office
for disciplinary action.

58
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,789
Right? Well?

59
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:31,835
Oh, my, this is a shocker, he got it in.

60
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:35,797
I'm saying, do not wager
against the Brown Beauty and the Snake.

61
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:38,717
He can unhinge his jaw
and he sheds skin.

62
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,014
Have a seat, please.

63
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,143
- Do you need anything? You okay?
- No, I'm good.

64
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,646
I mean, maybe a little leg room
would be nice.

65
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:54,483
This conversation is never an easy one
to have with an employee, Chuck.

66
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:56,985
And what conversation
would that be, exactly?

67
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:59,821
We've known each other
most of our lives.

68
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:04,660
We went through puberty together,
the awkward stage after puberty...

69
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:07,704
...awkward high school years,
your awkward college years...

70
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,165
...and now, our current awkward
Buy More years.

71
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:14,544
Which is why this moment for me
is so very...

72
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,005
- Awkward?
- Yeah.

73
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,883
- What exactly is going on?
- Something is.

74
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,718
Something is going on in your life.

75
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:25,847
You dumped Hannah, she quit Buy More.
She was a valued member of the store.

76
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:29,893
And I feel that a true best friend would
share that with his true best friend.

77
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:36,608
- You really wanna know the truth?
- I do.

78
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:41,488
Lay it on me like slice of cheese
on a tuna melt. I am ready.

79
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,367
Okay, here it goes.

80
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:04,219
- I--
- Okay, got it.

81
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:07,139
- You don't have to say any more.
- I didn't say anything.

82
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,808
- Do you need help?
- Never mind.

83
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:14,104
I cannot believe I'm saying this,
but you're fired.

84
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,441
What? You're firing me
from the Buy More?

85
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,067
Buy More, are you kidding me?

86
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:22,112
You're the best Nerd Herder we have.
I need you here.

87
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,448
I'm firing you as my best friend.

88
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:16,792
Hey, you guys leaving on the
mission? Sure you don't want me to join?

89
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,960
Love to but the Intersect is not working.

90
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,963
The agent The Ring plans to turn
is staying at this hotel.

91
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:26,635
There's no record of any spy being
there so whoever it is is deep undercover.

92
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,639
Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm still not flashing.

93
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,267
We've gotta go.

94
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,520
Look, the team's a man short
without me.

95
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,647
Not today, I'm taking your place.

96
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:41,316
The Ring knows you're alive, Shaw.
It's dangerous.

97
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,652
And I can't leave
this team shorthanded.

98
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,780
Besides, if The Ring wants a fight,
I'll give them a fight.

99
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:53,328
Now, when we get back, I expect
this place to be exactly as I left it.

100
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:58,208
- You two newlyweds ready?
- Yeah, let's go.

101
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,377
What's with the rings?

102
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:04,548
What...? Hey, Casey, what am I
supposed to do while you're gone?

103
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,174
Don't you have a day job?

104
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,687
- Hey, what's going on?
- Shh.

105
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,356
Charles, this is a spy mission.
You are not qualified.

106
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:22,858
All right.

107
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:28,655
Forty-nine, 57, 43, 40.

108
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,658
El Segundo School of Finance,
we take care of business.

109
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:38,707
- What's going on, Big Mike?
- Someone's thinking of buying the store.

110
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:42,210
We're closing so inspectors
and technicians can come kick the tires.

111
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:45,088
- We get the day off, Jeffrey. Let's get--
- No.

112
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:48,592
They want to interview everyone,
reevaluate the entire staff.

113
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,594
Fire everyone who's not essential.

114
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:55,599
We're in big trouble, boys.

115
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,394
Here are your keys.

116
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,855
Enjoy your stay here
at the Malibu Vista Hotel.

117
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,691
Might I add that the two of you
are a beautiful couple.

118
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,234
Oh, thank you.

119
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:12,908
Well, you two lovebirds have fun
while I'm cooped up in the van again.

120
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,534
Have a margarita for me.

121
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:21,750
There's a Ring
agent somewhere in this hotel. Find him.

122
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,585
I tapped into the mainframe.

123
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,922
If The Ring calls, we can trace it
to the room it originated from.

124
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,882
Sarah and I set up the equipment.

125
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,426
We'll begin searching
for possible targets.

126
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:36,723
Listen up, team.
These suits are sharks.

127
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:39,643
They'll try to divide us in interviews,
find weaknesses...

128
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,312
...look for any excuse they can
to fire our asses.

129
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,316
Yeah, listen, despite our differences,
all we have is each other.

130
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:50,904
- So let's stick together here, all right?
- This is a blood oath right here.

131
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,949
One for all and all for one.

132
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:56,368
- Lester Patel?
- Yeah, I found it.

133
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:59,287
Found it, contact lens.
All crisis averted.

134
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:00,747
- I love you, guys.
- Yeah.

135
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,124
Come on down.

136
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,921
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God, we're doomed.

137
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:11,299
Have a seat, yeah, have a seat.

138
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:12,968
Okay, stop.

139
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:15,637
Before I spill secrets,
I wanna know I'm protected.

140
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,305
I want diplomatic immunity.

141
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:20,141
Well, I don't think it's appropriate
in this situation.

142
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:23,186
Bup, bup, bup.
You want the dirt? I want immunity.

143
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,772
Okay, immunity granted.

144
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,650
Okay, thank you, my brother.

145
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:33,154
Well, it's an interesting group
of employees you've put together here.

146
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,740
Oh, they scare me too. Ha-ha-ha.

147
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,118
But I got Bartowski, don't I?
That's right.

148
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,996
A man with a Stanford degree
is working here?

149
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:44,541
You see, gentlemen, I'm not just
a manager, I'm a people person.

150
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,502
Talent follows me. Ha, ha.

151
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,713
Morgan Grimes, assistant manager.

152
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,840
Morgan, buddy, I need to talk to you.

153
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:55,510
- You don't or I wouldn't have fired you.
- Can I please have a minute?

154
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,221
Not now,
I'm freaking about this interview.

155
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:01,224
Look, hey, buddy,
you're gonna be fine.

156
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:03,351
Besides, you can always get
another job.

157
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,812
- It's not the end of the world.
- Really?

158
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,566
You see, it may not be the end to you
but I don't have a Stanford degree.

159
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:13,236
I can't do anything else but Buy More.
This job is all I have.

160
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,531
Chuck Bartowski?

161
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:18,700
You're up.

162
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,043
It's an impressive résumé.

163
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,171
So, what's a Stanford grad doing
working at a Buy More?

164
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:36,343
Let's just say the Buy More offers
more opportunities than meets the eye.

165
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:39,220
Really? For instance?

166
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,724
For instance, I get to work
with my best friend every day.

167
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:46,102
- Your best friend?
- Yeah.

168
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,105
Yeah, Morgan Grimes,
the assistant manager.

169
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:52,901
Based on your track record,
you're the cream of this Buy More crop.

170
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,362
Why aren't you the assistant manager?

171
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,742
Because the right guy
has already got the job.

172
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:04,871
I know that you guys are maybe
gonna be making changes around here.

173
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:10,251
So I just want you to know
that while I might look good on paper...

174
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:12,629
...I'm not the cream of the crop.

175
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,422
Morgan Grimes is.

176
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:21,054
Okay, The Ring just made a call
from the hotel.

177
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:23,890
I'll connect you in while I trace it back.

178
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:26,101
The target is by the pool.

179
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:29,729
Six-foot-two, well built. He's wearing
a blue and white bathing suit.

180
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,273
- Got that, Walker?
- Yeah, got it.

181
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,414
Did you find the target?

182
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,457
Yeah, we found him.

183
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,961
- Cheers.
- Oh, so nice. Ha, ha.

184
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,796
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you too.

185
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,965
- Yeah, good egg.
- Yeah, really good egg.

186
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,800
- Really good egg.
- Have a good day.

187
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,845
- Yeah, you too.
- Take care.

188
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:05,682
Get the others in here.

189
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,810
So you really think this Bartowski guy
is Agent Carmichael?

190
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:13,481
Oh, it's Carmichael, all right. Looks like
Shaw left him behind to man the fort.

191
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:14,983
Should we abort the mission?

192
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:18,987
With Shaw not here it's our best chance
to infiltrate and recover everything.

193
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,032
Found the entrance
into Shaw's base yet?

194
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,368
- No.
- We don't have time. We have to find it.

195
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:29,289
- Do you want us to take out Bartowski?
- Not yet.

196
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:30,832
Keep interviewing employees.

197
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,835
Make sure Shaw didn't leave
any other surprises behind.

198
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,175
Chuck said Grimes is his best friend.

199
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,177
We can use them to our advantage.

200
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,970
What about the others?

201
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,847
We need to be conservative here.

202
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,515
Terminate the rest.

203
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,860
Getting away was the best thing
we could've done.

204
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,863
I know I haven't been
the same guy lately...

205
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:06,201
...but since we got here,
I gotta tell you, I feel awesome again.

206
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,369
Me too. To us.

207
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:12,248
No stress. No work. No problemos.

208
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:17,420
Call came from Room 4305.
I'll head there now and search it.

209
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:20,673
We'll go to the pool,
get Devon and Ellie out of harm's way.

210
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,885
Come on, flash. Okay...

211
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,729
Oh, I know this, I know this.

212
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,565
Uh, the Condor, The Jackal.

213
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:42,403
Chan Min Chee.
Damn it, thought I had that one.

214
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:54,415
- This better be good.
- Hey, just checking in on the mission.

215
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,751
- If you needed anything.
- You flashing?

216
00:13:56,919 --> 00:14:00,588
I'm not, but I thought if you throw me
the rock, I'll pop on something.

217
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:03,925
- I don't have time for this.
- Only as good your last flash, huh?

218
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:11,599
- Mm. Two more piña coladas coming up.
- Okay.

219
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,400
How's the water?

220
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,701
What are you doing here?

221
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,996
You are not supposed to be here.
I just reclaimed my awesomeness.

222
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:36,416
We got a tip The Ring was to turn
an agent staying at this hotel.

223
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,711
- You.
- Me?

224
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,422
I'm not an agent.
Chuck told me I was in the clear.

225
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,010
Are Ellie and I in danger?

226
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,138
I don't know.

227
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,475
Can't believe they're selling Buy More.

228
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,312
I think they're serious
about buying this place.

229
00:14:57,521 --> 00:15:01,274
They have been going through it
with a comb, even checking lockers.

230
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,151
It was really great talking to you.

231
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,612
Jeffrey Barnes?

232
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:10,366
You gotta help me, Morgan.
I've got contraband in my locker.

233
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:11,659
What kind?

234
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:15,330
Just something I use to take
the edge off on a stressful day.

235
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:19,292
- If they find it, I'll be fired for sure.
- Mr. Barnes?

236
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,669
Morgan, please.

237
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,006
Okay, okay, all right, dude.

238
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,675
I'm at The Ring agent's room.

239
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,182
I'm going in.

240
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,351
- Be careful.
- I'm always careful.

241
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:47,153
The target is by the pool.

242
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:50,657
Six-foot-two, well built. He's wearing
a blue and white bathing suit.

243
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,325
Our operatives...

244
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,703
The target is about 6'2", well built.

245
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,997
He's wearing a blue
and white bathing suit.

246
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:00,833
- Our operatives are in position.
- It's a setup.

247
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:05,713
I gotta get Ellie out of here.
I gotta get us out now.

248
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,966
Keep it together, Devon.
We'll figure this out.

249
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,389
What? What was that?

250
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,224
I'm so sorry. False alarm.

251
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,519
You crash my getaway
to tell me I'm in danger.

252
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:22,188
- Now you tell me we're safe?
- Yes, I'm sorry.

253
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,607
Please try and enjoy
the rest of your vacation.

254
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,821
We got to get away from this.

255
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:33,324
Oh, my God.

256
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:37,578
What's this?

257
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:40,456
Let's see if we can
find anything in the break room.

258
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:04,605
Found something.
There's a tunnel behind these lockers.

259
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,443
Fingerprint scanner.

260
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:12,405
This must be it. Get Del and Neil.
Tell them we found the CIA base.

261
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:36,804
Good work.
Tell the others we found Shaw's base.

262
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,809
Oh, my God.

263
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:40,660
This is not right, not right.
You understand what I'm saying?

264
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,703
Hey, what's going on?

265
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:45,164
My spy work paid off, obviously.

266
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:48,960
I miked Big Mike's office. All I got was
a few seconds but here, listen.

267
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:51,629
Chuck said Grimes is his best friend.

268
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,256
We can use them to our advantage.

269
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:56,926
- What about the others?
- I think we need to be conservative here.

270
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,511
Terminate the rest.

271
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,722
They're gonna fire the entire store
except you and Morgan.

272
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,182
I just got this job back.

273
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,394
Where is Morgan?

274
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:21,075
Clever putting a CIA base
under an electronics store.

275
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:24,620
Every piece of intelligence Shaw
has on The Ring is in here.

276
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:28,541
We'll put a dagger through the heart
of the CIA's operation by taking it out.

277
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:29,959
Neil, you're on.

278
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,295
Cut off all communications
coming in and out.

279
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:36,257
Break into the mainframe, find
and destroy everything they have on us.

280
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,925
Then blow this base sky high.

281
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,802
Be a pleasure.

282
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,722
The phone works remotely.

283
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:46,267
- It was a setup. They lured us here.
- Why would they lure us here?

284
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:49,770
It's not where they lured us to,
it's where they lured us from.

285
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:53,316
The Ring knows I'm alive. Means they
know I'll have a base somewhere.

286
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,276
They sent us so I'd abandon my base.

287
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:58,154
That way they can recover
all the intelligence we have.

288
00:19:58,405 --> 00:19:59,947
They weren't after Devon.

289
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:02,825
- They're after Castle.
- Chuck's there. He's not flashing.

290
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,578
- He's a sitting duck.
- Go.

291
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,042
- We need to talk.
- We got to talk, me first.

292
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:14,170
Whatever you're gonna say is nothing
compared to what I got.

293
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:18,174
- Okay, fine, yeah, please, shoot.
- Okay, dude.

294
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:21,135
There's a secret underground CIA base
under our Buy More.

295
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,013
I know, I'd...

296
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:27,141
Hey, I know it sounds crazy
but you have to believe me.

297
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:30,102
These people claiming to buy,
they're bad guys, okay?

298
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,979
And they call themselves The Ring.

299
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:36,150
Which is like, ooh, not that scary but
these guys are not to be messed with.

300
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:40,071
- How do you know all this, Morgan?
- Okay, I was hiding in there.

301
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:44,575
I saw them enter through an entrance
behind our lockers so I followed them.

302
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,786
And I heard and saw everything.

303
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:50,122
Hey, dude, this is a lot to handle,
but you got to stay with me.

304
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,709
You gotta pull it together because
we are now in real danger here, okay?

305
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:57,088
Buddy, don't freak out.

306
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,548
Heh.

307
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,683
- Chuck's not answering his cell.
- The Buy More landline's down.

308
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,603
I think we should call the police.

309
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,022
That's a great idea.
That is a great idea, Morgan. Wow.

310
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:18,526
Wow. Yeah. Why?

311
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:19,860
What?

312
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:23,197
Wait, wait a minute, wait a minute.

313
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,033
I don't have a signal.

314
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:29,287
Right, bad guys cut off communication
to the store. Makes sense.

315
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:32,456
You know, by the time the cops
got here, it would be too late.

316
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,875
- We need to handle this now.
- No, Morgan.

317
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:37,461
We don't do anything
except get everyone out.

318
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,005
Charles, listen to yourself.

319
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:41,799
These men are trying to blow up
a base under our store.

320
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,635
We are Buy More's--
America's last line of defense.

321
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:48,389
- We are going to take the fight to them.
- Morgan, listen to yourself.

322
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:53,311
This is not a video game, this is real life.
People get hurt, there is no restart.

323
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,062
I understand you're scared.

324
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,773
And that not everybody
has the stomach to be a hero.

325
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,192
I'll see if Jeff and Lester
wanna help and...

326
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,361
Okay, look, fine, fine, fine.

327
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,030
I will help on one condition.

328
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:06,490
We get everyone else
out of the store first.

329
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:10,494
And what you've told me remains
a secret between the two of us.

330
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:14,582
Yes, you know what?
No need to put everyone at risk.

331
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:18,169
We will handle this, okay?
And this secret is locked down.

332
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,338
You would rather bring...

333
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,842
- What's going on?
- We're locking down the store, Charles.

334
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,303
Refusing to leave
until they give our jobs back.

335
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:30,598
No, guys, that is a very--
Please, don't do that.

336
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,100
Don't put that there.
Stop putting things down.

337
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:35,853
Look, locking down the store
is a very bad idea.

338
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:38,189
You two wanna turn tail and run?
Fine.

339
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,733
I'm staying here
and fighting for my job.

340
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,610
Mike, gentlemen, assorted ladies.

341
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:46,947
Taking over Buy More is not only illegal,
but it's dangerous, trust me.

342
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:49,825
The only thing dangerous
is if they try to fire us.

343
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:51,994
They'll have to do it
over dead bodies.

344
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:55,081
These fat cats think they can take
whatever they want.

345
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:56,749
They can take our dignity.

346
00:22:56,917 --> 00:23:01,921
They can take all the hot women,
but they will not take our jobs.

347
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:05,466
And they will never take our store.

348
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:21,065
- Sarah, Shaw, Casey, can you hear me?
- You have...

349
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:25,611
- Can you hear me?
- I can hear you, what's going on?

350
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:28,322
Oh, thank God, thank God.
Listen, listen, listen.

351
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:32,952
The Ring is inside Castle, guys.
Came in as buyers to purchase the store.

352
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:35,204
We're on our way back. Sit tight.

353
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,998
This is for you.
Mace. Not much, but it will do.

354
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,793
Emmett kept a stockpile
in case the Russians attacked.

355
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:43,254
This is for you, a walkie-talkie.
Don't drop it.

356
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,630
You ready? Let's do this.

357
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,341
No, no, no. Listen, listen, listen.

358
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,969
On second thought,
I don't think we should do this.

359
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:52,596
No, you're right.
Maybe get a burger or something.

360
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:55,933
Are you kidding me? Men are trying
to blow a base here, okay?

361
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:59,520
- Time is running out, time to step up.
- No, no, Morgan.

362
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:03,524
You don't want to do this, okay?
Trust me, you don't understand.

363
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:04,817
You don't understand.

364
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:07,570
I've been a loser my whole life.
I'm done with that.

365
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,738
It's time for me to be a hero.

366
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:20,666
But what is a hero, really?

367
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,460
You know?

368
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:25,463
You're all alone, Agent Carmichael.

369
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,423
I've locked down the base.

370
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,843
Sir, who's Agent Carmichael, okay?

371
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:33,429
You're crazy.
Guy's crazy. He thinks you're a spy.

372
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:37,016
- Yeah, ridiculous, thinking I'm a spy.
- Ridiculous, sir.

373
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:39,351
Okay, listen to me.
We work at the Buy More.

374
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:43,564
And if you let us go, we're not gonna
tell anyone what you're doing. Tell them.

375
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:44,899
I'll get you out of this.

376
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:47,610
Yeah, not a word, zipping it,
locking it down.

377
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:50,029
Locked. It's already locked down.

378
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:51,739
That is a sharp-looking razor.

379
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:56,327
We've searched the base's mainframe.
Shaw's files aren't there.

380
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:59,079
We know that he's hiding them here.

381
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:02,833
Tell us where they are,
Agent Carmichael.

382
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:07,296
Trust me, the alternative
is extremely unpleasant.

383
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:10,049
You know, I don't think
there's any need for torture.

384
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:12,635
Because even if I was a spy,
which I'm not.

385
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:16,388
But if I was a spy, my training would
have taught me to withstand torture.

386
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:20,768
So I don't really think it's gonna have
any effect at this juncture, right?

387
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:22,853
That's why I'm gonna torture him.

388
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:28,609
You made the mistake of telling us
the bearded fella is your best friend.

389
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:33,989
For the last time, where are the files,
Agent Carmichael?

390
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:37,826
Guys, guys, please.
Please, just listen to me.

391
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:40,412
This is ridiculous, okay?

392
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,915
I have known this man my entire life,
all right?

393
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:46,460
Chuck Bartowski has been
my best friend, my brother...

394
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,045
...since we were 6.

395
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:51,006
Chuck Bartowski is not a spy.

396
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:54,677
- Chuck, Chuck, Chuck.
- Chuck, please, tell him something.

397
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:57,012
- Chuck.
- Tell him the truth, I'm scared.

398
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,306
Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop, stop.

399
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:00,933
Stop.

400
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:05,521
Morgan, the truth is...

401
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:13,737
The truth is I am a member...

402
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:18,492
...of a joint NSA-CIA
black ops team...

403
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:21,829
...that is stationed here in Burbank.

404
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:25,207
I have a level six clearance...

405
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:29,003
...and my code name
is Charles Carmichael.

406
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:32,548
I'm a spy, buddy.

407
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,600
Sarah, anything?

408
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,938
We're locked out.
They overrode our security access.

409
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,983
I'm locked out here.
Casey's checking Buy More.

410
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:02,202
Cease fire, cease fire.
Hold your fire, hold your fire.

411
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,454
Unlock the doors.

412
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,626
What is going on here?

413
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:12,129
Store's being bought, canning
everybody except Bartowski and Grimes.

414
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:15,382
We're staging a revolution
to take down the man.

415
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:18,552
- I want in.
- How do we know we can trust you?

416
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,512
That you're not some spy
for the man?

417
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:24,642
Because the thing I hate more than
hippie, neo-liberal fascists, anarchists...

418
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:28,896
...are the hypocrite fat-cat suits
they eventually grow up to become.

419
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,774
Yup, that works for me, good point.
Nice to chat.

420
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,484
Welcome aboard, my brother.

421
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:37,404
You're a spy?

422
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:40,574
Remember what I said
about freaking out? You're doing that.

423
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:43,077
- And you shouldn't do that.
- You're a spy?

424
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:46,246
- Stay with me, buddy, okay?
- You can kiss and make up later.

425
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:48,415
Where are Shaw's files? Now, Chuck.

426
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:52,586
We've got visitors. Colonel Casey and
Agent Walker decided to join the party.

427
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:55,839
- Casey and Sarah are spies too?
- You got catching up to do.

428
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,259
Excuse me
while I take care of your friends.

429
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:01,512
We'll save the torture for later.

430
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:05,849
No, no, no, I can't...

431
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,768
I can't believe it.

432
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,813
All this time, you kept this a secret?

433
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,900
- From me?
- I'm so sorry, Morgan.

434
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:17,945
You have no idea how badly
I've wanted to tell you.

435
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,197
All this lying about where I've been...

436
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,616
You know,
making plans and breaking them.

437
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:26,954
And all the time, all I've wanted
to do was tell you all about it.

438
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:30,374
But I had to protect you too, you know?
Please understand that.

439
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:33,794
Wow.

440
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,004
Wow!

441
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,881
I don't...

442
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,802
My best friend is a spy?

443
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,263
This is unbelievable!
Best news I've ever heard!

444
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:46,432
Holy smokes,
it makes perfect sense too.

445
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,892
Why we stopped hanging out
and talking.

446
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:52,479
I thought I lost you, buddy,
but you were out saving the world?

447
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:55,315
Look at you.
You are rehired as my best friend.

448
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:57,484
Great, that's good news, thanks.

449
00:28:57,652 --> 00:29:00,154
Oh, I have so many questions.
Where do I start?

450
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:03,574
Uh, how did this happen?
Did they recruit you at the Buy More?

451
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,659
Stanford?

452
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,286
Chuck?

453
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:10,164
I'm pretty sure we're gonna die,
so no time for secrets.

454
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,001
You know what? You're right, buddy.

455
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:17,796
You're right, and quite frankly,
you deserve to know.

456
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:21,300
- So here goes, you ready?
- Yeah, yeah, man.

457
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:23,594
Okay.

458
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:27,264
Started two and a half years ago,
when I got an e-mail from Bryce Larkin.

459
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:40,694
Some folks were born

460
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,821
Made to wave the flag

461
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:45,532
Ooh, they're red, white and blue

462
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:49,703
And when the band plays
"Hail to the Chief"

463
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:53,290
Ooh, they point the cannon at you
Lord

464
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:57,753
It ain't me
It ain't me

465
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:00,214
I ain't no senator's son, son

466
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:04,551
It ain't me
It ain't me

467
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,929
I ain't no fortunate one
No

468
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,057
What is that noise?

469
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,935
The Buy More employees
have staged a revolution.

470
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,979
- So that's the sound of liberty.
- Mm-hm.

471
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,565
--Taxman comes to the door

472
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,318
Lord, the house looks like
A rummage sale, yes

473
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:22,694
Good news, bad news.

474
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:26,990
Good news, we found what we were
looking for. Uploaded it to headquarters.

475
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:30,077
Bad news? Colonel Casey
has arrived at the Buy More.

476
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,079
Could be a problem.

477
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:35,165
Not if he's dead. Kill him.

478
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,667
Whoo!

479
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,838
It ain't me
It ain't me

480
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:44,633
I ain't no fortunate one
No, no, no

481
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:47,302
It ain't me
It ain't me

482
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:51,765
I ain't no fortunate son
No, no, no

483
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,373
Peace out, man.

484
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:19,626
Hey, brother Casey,
make love not war.

485
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:23,630
You want a hit?

486
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:31,471
Hey, man, that's not cool.

487
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:41,440
Fight the power.

488
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,944
Peace out.

489
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:54,077
Crap.

490
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:57,748
Castle has a self-destruct program
in case of events like this.

491
00:31:57,957 --> 00:32:01,460
- Calling Langley to activate it now.
- You can't, Chuck is down there.

492
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:05,255
So is every piece of intelligence,
not just on The Ring, everything.

493
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:08,550
Please, just give Chuck
five more minutes, okay? For me.

494
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,929
I'm sorry, you can't think of Chuck.
You have to think like a spy.

495
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:13,347
I am thinking like a spy.

496
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:16,058
Chuck is a member of my team.
He has served well.

497
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:17,976
And for all that he has done...

498
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:22,022
...the least we can do
is just give him five more minutes.

499
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:31,990
So that's it. That's how it happened.

500
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,118
So now I got this thing in my brain.

501
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:39,706
The Intersect, like I told you, you know.
And it's not working.

502
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:43,335
Anything else you wanna know
before we die?

503
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:46,380
Uh, yeah, yeah, just one more.

504
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:50,133
So if Sarah is your handler,
does that make her your beard?

505
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:53,220
In other words, like--
Is your whole relationship a fake?

506
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:58,392
- Because, buddy, that's just awful.
- Why, because we never had sex?

507
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:02,646
No, I just felt like, having to be--
You never had sex with that girl?

508
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:04,731
That's not-- No, no, it's...

509
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:09,569
It's awful you had to pretend to be in
a relationship with somebody you love.

510
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,032
Sarah and I are over, you know.

511
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,201
No, you're not.

512
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,997
You're a good liar, Chuck,
but you're not that good, all right?

513
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,499
You lied to me for three years
but I always knew.

514
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:27,421
You loved that girl.
I mean, I saw the way you looked at her.

515
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,381
We all did.

516
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:34,428
It's okay, you don't have to deny it.

517
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:38,140
You tell me you don't love Sarah?

518
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:46,940
You know what? You're right, buddy.

519
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:49,443
I do love Sarah.

520
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:53,113
I kept telling myself that I didn't.

521
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:57,576
That I wouldn't, I couldn't, but I do.

522
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:08,128
Morgan, you have no idea how badly
I needed to get all this off my chest.

523
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:10,172
Thank you.

524
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,760
Get rid of them.
Kill them, dump the bodies.

525
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:25,312
Thank me later, buddy.
We're about to die.

526
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,815
No, you're not.

527
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:53,924
- Chuck, sword.
- Thanks, buddy.

528
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,511
Mine's bigger than yours.

529
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:21,368
That was incredible.
You were incredible.

530
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,995
Like Bruce Lee, Van Damme,
Seagal rolled into one.

531
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:26,164
That's my best friend.

532
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:30,043
Yeah, he's out. He's out.

533
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:35,882
I couldn't get in. We're locked out.

534
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:39,052
Time's up.

535
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:43,014
This is Langley Control.

536
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,080
Bag them and tag them, Sarah.

537
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:10,041
Excuse me.

538
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:11,585
Agent Walker.

539
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,523
We'll just have to put Grimes
in witness protection.

540
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:36,109
Move him out of Burbank tonight
after dark.

541
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,528
Wait, no, no, no. Hang on a second.

542
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:41,698
- Morgan's not going anywhere, okay?
- He knows your secret.

543
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:43,825
So do a lot of people.

544
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:46,161
Awesome knows.
We didn't put him underground.

545
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:48,496
Because Awesome's awesome.
Grimes is a moron.

546
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:51,333
We have no reason to believe
that we can trust him.

547
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:52,959
Yes, we do.

548
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:55,837
We have 22 reasons
why we can trust him.

549
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,840
That's the number of years
Morgan has been my best friend.

550
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,800
And yes, he has his faults, granted.

551
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:03,094
But one thing he is is loyal.

552
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:07,390
And he will never betray me
or my secret.

553
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:11,311
He's right.

554
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:13,939
Thank you.

555
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:15,315
Look, I'm flashing.

556
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,943
I'm a spy again
because I have my best friend back.

557
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,445
You need the Intersect
and I need him.

558
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:23,240
So Morgan Grimes is staying
exactly where he belongs...

559
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:25,158
...which is the Burbank Buy More.

560
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,127
Thank you.

561
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:39,965
Hey, hey, buddy.

562
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:41,549
- Hey.
- Sorry about the wait.

563
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,301
No, no problem, no problem.

564
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:45,929
Colonel Casey.
Always walking around so angry.

565
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:48,431
Should've known
you had a big secret.

566
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:49,641
God help us.

567
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,351
So, yeah, everything's okay.

568
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,727
Great. I love to hear it.

569
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:55,939
Okay, so am I, like,
officially part of the team, or--?

570
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:58,024
Let's, um...

571
00:37:58,192 --> 00:37:59,985
Let's walk before we run, huh, buddy?

572
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:03,113
Yeah, maybe crawl before that.

573
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,323
Yeah. You know,
we should celebrate, okay?

574
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:08,618
Game night: "Duck Hunt,"
Subway Meatball Marinara...

575
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,787
...the way you like it
and the two of us.

576
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,289
Yeah, just the two of us.

577
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:14,374
- Ha, ha.
- This place is amazing.

578
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,344
- Buy More.
- Yes, hello.

579
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:29,139
This is Craig Rogers
from Buy More corporate.

580
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:33,810
I heard what happened there today.
Interesting display you put on there.

581
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:36,604
You calling to fire us or arrest us?

582
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:39,524
Neither. I'm calling to hire you.

583
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:42,068
Yesterday, I was planning
on selling the store.

584
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:45,322
But I spoke to the potential buyers
and from what I've heard...

585
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:49,576
...your store showed the most incredible
display of store loyalty I've ever seen.

586
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:51,911
The store's no longer for sale.

587
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:06,843
Victory.

588
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:16,144
When was the last time
you beat me at "Duck Hunt"?

589
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:17,687
I am the old school master.

590
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:21,107
Tell me, when was the last time
that you beat me at "Duck Hunt"?

591
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:22,776
- That's incredible.
- All right.

592
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:25,028
Keep these subs warm for me,
would you?

593
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,821
I'll be right in.

594
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,910
I talked to Shaw
and I heard what happened.

595
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,912
The Ring used me as a decoy.

596
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,955
- You said I was safe, bro.
- And you are.

597
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:37,624
You will be, okay?

598
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,584
We are doing everything
that we can...

599
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:42,337
...to make sure you and Ellie
are protected and safe.

600
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,589
Okay?

601
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:46,758
Okay.

602
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,218
Okay.

603
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:50,011
Okay.

604
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:07,779
You okay? You've been a nervous wreck
ever since this morning.

605
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:10,198
- Babe, we need to get away.
- We just got away.

606
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:13,618
I'm talking about really getting away.
Just you and me.

607
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:15,995
Okay. Where do you wanna go?

608
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,289
Cabo?

609
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:19,916
- Further.
- Hawaii?

610
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,167
No, no, further.

611
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:23,545
I'm talking about...

612
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:29,634
- Africa.
- Africa.

613
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:32,846
- We can join Doctors Without Borders.
- Doctors Without Borders?

614
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:36,099
- Honey, you didn't wanna go to France.
- This is different, hon.

615
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,643
I am talking about you and me
traveling the world.

616
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:39,894
What do you say?

617
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:44,065
- I don't know what to say.
- Say yes.

618
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:47,652
This is crazy.
We can't just up and leave.

619
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,238
What about Chuck?
I'm the only family that he has.

620
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:53,450
But this isn't about Chuck.
No, this is about you and me.

621
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:55,618
About our family.

622
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:58,121
Come on, babe.

623
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:03,543
The Ring knows about the Castle.
Does that mean we have to shut down?

624
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,545
The Ring shut down
all communications.

625
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:09,048
Never had a chance to let their superiors
know about their discovery.

626
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:11,926
That will buy us time
to put together a full offensive.

627
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:15,305
- Take them down once and for all.
- So then what's wrong?

628
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:18,016
The Ring had me dead to rights
today in Malibu.

629
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:20,310
So why didn't they kill me?

630
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:24,189
So Sarah and Casey,
they're really spies, huh?

631
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:26,816
Yeah, yeah, they're great.

632
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:29,152
I trust them with my life.

633
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:37,160
Are you kidding me?

634
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:40,163
That is ridiculous, dude.
Look at that shooting.

635
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,789
Are--?

636
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:45,585
You did your flash thingy on it.
You flashed on "Duck Hunt."

637
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:18,284
- Hello?
- Hello, Colonel Casey.

638
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:20,662
It's been a while.
