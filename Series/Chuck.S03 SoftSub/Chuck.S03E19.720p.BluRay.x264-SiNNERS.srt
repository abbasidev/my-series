1
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:13,637
Chuck. Get back here.
Mom is gonna be so mad.

2
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:17,433
- Dad! Dad, help!
- I'm working, Charles.

3
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,019
Uh...

4
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:22,438
Please come out. Hurry.

5
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:26,775
What's going on here?
I'm trying to work.

6
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:28,819
Chuck broke Mom's favorite necklace.

7
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:35,367
Is that true, Charles?

8
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,788
I didn't mean to.

9
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,248
He admitted it.

10
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,709
Uh-uh. Let me see it.

11
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:57,014
There's nothing broken
in this whole world...

12
00:00:57,182 --> 00:01:00,309
...that the two of you can't fix.
If you work together.

13
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,397
Charles...

14
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,484
...go into your sister's room
and get some of her art supplies.

15
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:13,155
Ellie, you're gonna help him.
I know it's hard, El. But your--

16
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:18,452
Your brother does have a knack
for getting into trouble.

17
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,871
But you--

18
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,998
You're gonna have to protect Chuck.

19
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,626
Be there for him no matter what.

20
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:28,337
Because you're his big sister.

21
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,173
Can you do that for me?

22
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:43,435
Devon, I lost them. I lost the truck.
Call me as soon as you can see them, okay?

23
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:46,480
Chuck, where are you?

24
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,366
I know how much you're hurting,
Chuck...

25
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:00,494
...but you have to know
there's nothing you could've done, okay?

26
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,704
It's not your fault.

27
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:05,040
Yes, it is.

28
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,836
I'm the one who downloaded
the Intersect 2.0.

29
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:12,714
I'm the one who chose to be a spy.
And it's him who paid the price.

30
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:19,388
Who's gonna get us out of this one?

31
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,724
Who even knows we're here?

32
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,858
- Okay, babe. We found them.
- Devon, these people killed my father.

33
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:33,902
They're gonna do the same to Chuck.
You have to stop them.

34
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,531
I know. I know. We're on it.

35
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,908
What are we gonna do?
We don't have a plan.

36
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,577
No plan?

37
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:43,078
Never stopped me before.

38
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,335
Everybody good? Comfy?

39
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,890
Uncuff yourselves.

40
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,102
Should look like you were trying to escape
when I kill you.

41
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,562
Gee, Morgan.

42
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,357
When one is facing a group of murderers,
one should have a plan.

43
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:16,195
Okay, I agree with you in principle,
but we're here now, all right?

44
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,906
What? Open up the glove box,
pull out the spy manual.

45
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:21,575
Maybe-- This is Casey's car.

46
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:22,910
- Glove box.
- Glove box.

47
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,581
Whoa.

48
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,291
- Get to it.
- I'm a doctor.

49
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,461
- I can't use this.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy. Well, I'm--

50
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,255
I'm a lapsed vegetarian.

51
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:37,633
Dude, there's a button.

52
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:41,511
- Whoa.
- What did you just do?

53
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,347
- I hit a button.
- Well, un-hit it.

54
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:45,682
- Hey.
- What are you doing? You're gonna get--

55
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,310
- How many missions you been on?
- How many have you--?

56
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,952
Chuck, are you okay?

57
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,828
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

58
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,331
Everyone okay?

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,751
We're here to save you.

60
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,187
Hey. You used my missile.

61
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,106
- Pretty cool, huh?
- Yeah.

62
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,816
Yell at me later. Let's go.

63
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:51,164
Chuck. Come on. Get in the car.
Come on. Get in the car.

64
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:52,541
Let's go! Let's go!

65
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:53,959
Move it! Move it!

66
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:37,085
You're gonna have to protect Chuck.

67
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,254
Be there for him no matter what.

68
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,757
Because you're his big sister.

69
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,093
Can you do that for me?

70
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:48,680
Yeah.

71
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,766
Okay, Dad. I promise.

72
00:05:57,106 --> 00:06:00,567
By now Shaw has alerted The Ring
of our escape. They'll be looking for us.

73
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:04,446
- What do we do now?
- I learned from my dad we have to be smart.

74
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,281
Do what he would've done. Disappear.

75
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,241
Give up our old lives.

76
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:11,286
- Drop off the grid.
- So we're in agreement. That's the plan.

77
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,246
I'm sorry. That's the plan?

78
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,957
- Give up our lives?
- The best for all of us.

79
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,627
Devon, what are you talking about?
This is not us.

80
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:21,588
We don't live off grids, okay?
We are regular people.

81
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,591
We live on planet Earth
and my father was murdered today.

82
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,469
Our father, Chuck.

83
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:36,603
- I'm calling the police. It's what people do.
- Oh, hey, no calls. They'll track them.

84
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:39,981
- This is insane. I'm going.
- Sis, wait.

85
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,904
- Get out of the car.
- Can we talk about this?

86
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:49,157
- What's happening?
- Is my husband safe with you?

87
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,034
Um...

88
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:54,413
- Yeah, why?
- Because Chuck and I need to talk.

89
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,334
Two Bartowskis. Double the fun.

90
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:08,218
Hello, egg white omelet on English muffin
with my favorite banana peppers to boot.

91
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:12,347
One hundred sixty calories
of deliciousness.

92
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:15,809
I do know how to build
a better breakfast.

93
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,687
Mm.

94
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,453
Talk to me, Moses.

95
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:40,167
Anyone seen Morgan? Chuck?
Tell me John is in the john.

96
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:43,628
- Can we help you, sir?
- I need my assistant managers. And Chuck.

97
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:47,549
What we lack, profoundly and proudly,
in on-the-job competence...

98
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,177
...we more than make up for
with listening skills.

99
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:54,055
Actually, I'm deaf in my left ear.
Except for a faint ringing.

100
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,519
It's big news, boys.
The store's numbers are down.

101
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:03,023
My main man Moses,
founder of the Buy More himself, called.

102
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:07,152
Said if we don't see a spike in numbers
and fast, they're gonna close the store.

103
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,572
- What?
- Factoring Jeffrey out for a minute...

104
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:15,410
...may I propose something
that I rarely do in life myself?

105
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:19,414
- Tell the truth.
- What you talking about, Lester?

106
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:23,210
If in fact we're going out of business,
why not just tell that...

107
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:26,922
- ...to our most loyal customers?
- Have a going-out-of-business sale.

108
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:31,593
Slash prices, sell everything
to juice the books?

109
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,931
- That's crazy.
- Crazy...

110
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,268
...good?

111
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:44,272
There may be a brain
under that mop after all.

112
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:49,194
- Hello?
- The phone did not ring, Jeffrey.

113
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,863
Stupid left ear.

114
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,783
I don't understand
how you can know all this...

115
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,494
...how you can have all these secrets...

116
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:01,373
...and I'm the last person to know.

117
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:04,209
I thought that I knew you better
than anyone.

118
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:08,588
Not telling was the best way to keep you
safe. There's no one I wanted to tell more.

119
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,757
I mean, you raised me, you know?

120
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,722
When I broke Mom's necklace...

121
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:21,935
...and she left a couple days later,
I thought that's why she disappeared.

122
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,311
That it was my fault.

123
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,814
I hated her for leaving.

124
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,110
For making you feel that way.

125
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,988
And the way you were with Dad?

126
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:37,242
No 12-year-old should ever have to worry
about handling the family's bank account.

127
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,953
I can't believe that he's gone.

128
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,085
- Our crazy dad.
- He wasn't crazy.

129
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:52,674
Our dad was a hero.

130
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:57,804
He was a great man
who did amazing things.

131
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,515
He was not perfect, not as a dad. No.

132
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:01,766
But he was great.

133
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:10,025
That's the secret
I most wanted you to know.

134
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,539
What are we gonna do?

135
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,292
We're gonna go and get them.
Take them down.

136
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,377
The Ring, Shaw.
For what they did to Dad.

137
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:31,129
They are not gonna get away.

138
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:33,715
Okay.

139
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:38,470
- And then you're done.
- What?

140
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,556
As a spy. This-- This life, this job.

141
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:45,644
Chuck, I made a promise to protect you
and I can't do it. Not from this.

142
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,563
So you finish it...

143
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,358
...and then you're done.

144
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:54,235
- Ellie, I can't--
- We are all that we have left, Chuck.

145
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:58,490
I'm not gonna lose you too.

146
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,537
Okay.

147
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,415
I'll get Shaw and I quit.

148
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:09,918
I promise.

149
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,758
All right, Devon is in the car,
Sarah is making sure it's not bugged.

150
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,678
You leave the city.
Don't tell me where. I don't wanna know.

151
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:23,139
Use only cash and payphones.
I will call you when it's safe. Got that?

152
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:26,059
Got it. Okay. What about Morgan?
Should I take him with me?

153
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,896
Funny thing about Morgan.
He's actually a part of my spy team.

154
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:33,441
- He's helping Casey's daughter go off-grid.
- Casey has a daughter?

155
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:37,278
I know. It's a lot to process.
There's not enough time. You have to go.

156
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,781
Stay safe.

157
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,450
Don't forget about your promise.

158
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:44,786
I won't.

159
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,419
Time to take down The Ring.

160
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,884
The perimeter is set.
What are you doing?

161
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,721
When Shaw grabbed me,
I noticed the cells were equipped...

162
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:06,182
...for remote interrogation.
If I can crack into their system, we can--

163
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,268
Wait.

164
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:11,104
There. There. Right there. There she is.

165
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:12,480
It's Beckman.

166
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,816
I'm gonna open a channel. General?

167
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,819
- General.
- Who's there?

168
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,988
- Is that you, Shaw?
- General, it's Chuck.

169
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:25,326
Chuck? Thank God.
Where are you? What are you doing?

170
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:29,831
We're gonna take down Shaw and The Ring.
But we honestly have no idea how to do it.

171
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:34,419
Listen fast. I came to Los Angeles
for the Joint Security Summit.

172
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:38,757
It's a public conference of security experts,
but it's really a secret meeting of spies.

173
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:42,177
Shaw's plan was to discredit me
and take my place at the conference.

174
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:45,972
- A coup d'état.
- The Ring is taking over the CIA and NSA.

175
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,475
So if we had a plan,
that plan would be...?

176
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:52,437
The conference is happening tonight
at the Grande Ambassador.

177
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,689
Wait. General. Wait. Damn it.

178
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,483
Chuck. Chuck.

179
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,194
The five Elders will be there.

180
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,536
Hey, are you okay?

181
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:10,872
Yeah.

182
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,334
Yeah, sorry.
Yeah, I'm-- Just a-- A lot of data.

183
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,127
MORGAN;
Listen, who are the Elders?

184
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,713
They sound scary.
Like "World of Warcraft" scary.

185
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:22,050
The Elders, Morgan,
are the leaders of The Ring.

186
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:25,053
Makes sense. Ring operatives are hidden
in all major agencies.

187
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:28,223
We break into the convention,
expose Shaw, capture the Elders.

188
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:32,811
The conference, surrounded by an army
of security agents and filled with spies.

189
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,979
- Suicide mission.
- Ones to pull it off...

190
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:38,525
- ...would have to be the best spies.
- Chuck, you're embarrassing me.

191
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,905
- We can do it.
- Well, we better. It's Shaw.

192
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,408
- We don't have a choice.
- Let's get some payback.

193
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:50,411
That's what I was gonna say.
Definitely get some payback time.

194
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:51,579
Okay, Chuck.

195
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:54,374
We're going in undercover
as members of the Russian delegation.

196
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:57,919
This means we need disguises.
You think you can handle that?

197
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,296
Sarah, I played Perchik in Fiddler.

198
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:01,714
It's true. He was great.

199
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,258
Thanks, buddy.

200
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,770
It's him. Shaw.

201
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:17,772
Excuse me.

202
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,693
Once we ID Shaw, Casey,
you and Morgan will take over.

203
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,612
We're in the server room.
Why did I get Morgan for this?

204
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,739
Hey-- Hey. I'm right here. Please.

205
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,701
Just call me after you've cracked
into the database.

206
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:34,289
Great. There's the conduit right there.
So I just need a hand getting up there.

207
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,295
- You ready?
- I was born ready--

208
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:44,132
Well-- No, actually, no.
I wasn't born ready. But I am ready now.

209
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:48,261
Remember, Chuck,
in order for this plan to work...

210
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,930
...you need to fully convince Shaw.
Make eye contact.

211
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,975
Shake his hand
and act as if you were strangers.

212
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,686
Excuse me.

213
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,898
I don't believe we've met.

214
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,275
Daniel Shaw.

215
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,028
Yes. Yuri Shushenko.

216
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:08,489
- It is great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Shaw.
- Well, thank you.

217
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:12,660
If you'll excuse me.

218
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,337
Good job.

219
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:23,755
Well, you can thank...

220
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,133
- ...my very convincing facial hair.
- Come on.

221
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,264
Oh, good. Good, good.
Chuck, number 752.

222
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,476
Get that? Seven-five-two.

223
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,770
Hold on a second.
Let me get this thing off.

224
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,521
Hold on one second.

225
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,442
Whoa! Whoa, whoa.

226
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,986
Hey. A little help.

227
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,494
Why do you have
my daughter's phone number?

228
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:55,787
I don't know.

229
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,543
Hi, Chuck.

230
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:05,880
Shaw says your accent could use
a little work.

231
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,383
Justin. You're the one
who manipulated my sister?

232
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,301
That's right.

233
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,971
Yeah. Well, I think this is gonna hurt
a little bit.

234
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,984
Chuck. Chuck?

235
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,235
Are you okay?

236
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:29,821
I'm sorry.

237
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:31,906
I didn't wanna tell you.

238
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:33,992
Just tell me what's going on.

239
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,912
The Intersect.
The flashes are getting worse.

240
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,915
We have to abort.
Shaw is not worth this.

241
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:45,086
No. If I can get the Governor back,
I'll be fine. You help Morgan and Casey.

242
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:49,048
- I-- I can't leave you like this.
- I'm okay, really. You have to go.

243
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,759
We have to stop him.

244
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,601
You're not gonna believe it.

245
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,228
Yes?

246
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,151
There's a line around the store...

247
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:11,696
...of stay-at-home moms
ready for the sale tomorrow.

248
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,281
Yes.

249
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:21,289
Big Mike, we-- Jefferson and myself
were hoping to screen this tomorrow.

250
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:24,876
You know, since you're a manager and all,
we thought it'd be a good idea.

251
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,086
- What is it?
- Our music video.

252
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:29,297
- We spent two weekends on it.
- Two weekends.

253
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,134
Great idea.

254
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,344
But let's do it late in the day.

255
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:38,097
Wouldn't wanna scare anyone away
too early.

256
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,308
- Right.
- The CIA believes...

257
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:43,478
...that international terrorism
is a growth industry.

258
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:47,148
The demand for the security we offer
is even greater than it was a year ago.

259
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,484
Which brings me to my next point.

260
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:00,661
Excuse me.

261
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:06,000
Did you know that Nerd Herd offers
a wide variety of helpful hints...

262
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,127
...for making your presentations better?

263
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,254
Chuck. Where are you?

264
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:13,508
I'm in Room 752,
which I believe is your room.

265
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:18,721
Also, we are well aware that your bosses,
The Ring Elders, are in the audience now...

266
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:22,433
...and they have got
to be asking themselves:

267
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,685
"Who is Daniel talking to?"

268
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,738
Ladies and gentlemen,
please remain seated.

269
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:38,324
The presentation will begin again shortly.

270
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,035
Casey, Morgan. Shaw has left the stage.

271
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,704
Tell me. Why do you have
my daughter's phone number?

272
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:47,667
Hold on a second.
Alex gave that to me on her own free will.

273
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,127
But as friends.

274
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,378
- Friends?
- Yeah.

275
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,046
Or something more?

276
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:55,133
Your heart's racing, pupils dilated,
skin's flush.

277
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:59,679
- You like her.
- Or you're choking me.

278
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:01,973
- Hey.
- Sarah.

279
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,892
- Oh, just in time.
- What for? Come on, let's go.

280
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,314
Not a toy, Morgan.

281
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,191
- Ready?
- Yeah.

282
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,236
This discussion is not over.

283
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,071
- Muzzle down.
- Muzzle down.

284
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,501
No gun.

285
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,545
Very brave, Chuck.

286
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:34,589
So, what's happening?

287
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:35,798
You're under arrest.

288
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,592
No. What are you doing here?

289
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:38,926
What's your plan?

290
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:42,680
I'm sorry. Are you asking me
to make the classic villain mistake...

291
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,850
...of explaining my dastardly plot to you?

292
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:47,435
Know what? I'd love to.

293
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:52,231
I confess we had no idea
who the Elders were or how to ID them.

294
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:56,944
So we let you do that for us
when you warned them to leave the theater.

295
00:19:57,112 --> 00:20:01,616
So on behalf of the NSA, the CIA
and of course your local Buy More...

296
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,618
...I'd just like to say thanks.

297
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,121
Hey.

298
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,208
Going somewhere?

299
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,959
Reach for the sky, dirtbags.

300
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:14,253
You people are the disease
and I'm the cure.

301
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:17,465
Back off there, Cobra.
I didn't give you any bullets.

302
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,967
Are you kidding me?
I knew this felt too light.

303
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:25,056
Chuck? We've got them.
I'm on my way up to you.

304
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,933
Do not give Shaw an inch.

305
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,518
Done. Ring captured.

306
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,063
That's another check on my to-do list.

307
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,899
Do you see what you did wrong?

308
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,860
You and your team are fugitives.

309
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:40,154
On who's authority
would anyone arrest me?

310
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,241
What about my father?

311
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:45,159
Yes.

312
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,452
I killed your father.

313
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:50,122
Yes, I work for The Ring
and I'm going to destroy the CIA.

314
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:55,169
And still I'm gonna walk out of here a hero.
How does that make you feel?

315
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:06,347
You know, your Nerd Herd associate...

316
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,684
...can also help you
with video conferencing.

317
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,106
Smile, Daniel.

318
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:17,483
You're on TV.

319
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,286
What do I say to that?

320
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:30,997
Mwa-ha-ha.

321
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,166
Now...

322
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,295
...give me the Governor.

323
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:42,008
Don't make me take it from you.

324
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,010
I'd like to see you try.

325
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,188
I knew you didn't have it in you.

326
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,323
So clever. So smart.

327
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,785
There's no way out of this one.

328
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,787
Shaw, drop him.

329
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:29,180
Chuck.

330
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:31,766
Hey.

331
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,437
Help me.

332
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:42,777
Going out of business? What the--?

333
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:50,326
What the hell is going on here?
I've only been gone for two days.

334
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:51,994
These numbers are amazing.

335
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:54,330
Boys, you know what time it is?

336
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:57,875
- Please say Jeffster time. Say it. Say it.
- Say it.

337
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:01,379
Play your video. Play it loud.

338
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:03,506
What the hell is going on here?

339
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:07,093
Who authorized this sale?
This store is supposed to be closed.

340
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,178
These people are stealing from us.

341
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:13,224
This is not good. Old man Moses
couldn't protect us anymore.

342
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,434
They up and closed the store.

343
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:18,896
All of this was supposed to be shipped
to Beverly Hills. Where is Mike?

344
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,315
Go, go, go.

345
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:23,734
Hey.

346
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:26,821
Hey.

347
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,953
- Where is everyone?
- Casey's getting Ellie, Awesome.

348
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,163
And Morgan's checking in
to the Buy More.

349
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:38,374
I promised her I'd leave...

350
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:41,085
...that I wouldn't be a spy anymore.

351
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,462
- What?
- Ellie.

352
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:47,925
- She's gonna be so mad at me if I die.
- Hey, we're gonna get that Governor, okay?

353
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:51,095
I'm gonna find Shaw, I'm gonna
get it back no matter where he is.

354
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,560
- Hello?
- This isn't about you.

355
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,564
- Shaw.
- I'm in the store.

356
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,774
I've wired it with explosives.

357
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:49,737
It'll take 10 minutes
for the CIA back-up team to arrive.

358
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,030
I only need seconds.

359
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:56,410
I want you to send me Chuck. Now.

360
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:01,540
Okay. We're on our way.

361
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:16,222
Help. Help me. Anybody!

362
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,099
Come on.

363
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:21,060
Come on.

364
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:23,854
Come-- Oh, no.

365
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:50,381
What the hell is going on?
Walker just pulled the silent alarm.

366
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:51,924
Yeah, it's Shaw. He's here.

367
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:55,135
He planted bombs all over the store,
he'll blow the whole place up.

368
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:00,849
Where is Chuck?

369
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:04,478
You gotta get everyone out.
Are you near a fire alarm?

370
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:07,523
Yes, it's outside the cage,
but I'm tied up inside the cage.

371
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:10,818
- My hands are cuffed to a chair.
- You gotta break your thumbs.

372
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:14,905
- I'm sorry, can you say that again?
- Your thumbs.

373
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,865
To get free, you gotta break them.

374
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:18,117
Now. Do it.

375
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,202
Break your thumbs.

376
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,913
Yes, sir.

377
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:36,677
- You don't wanna kill all these people.
- You're right.

378
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,554
I don't wanna kill all these people.

379
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,223
However, I would like to kill Chuck.

380
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,184
And I wouldn't mind killing you too.

381
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:49,690
Have you seen Big Mike?

382
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,109
We're gonna need a diversion
to get out of here.

383
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,319
What are you thinking?

384
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:54,945
Pineapple.

385
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:10,210
Get out of here. Go, go.

386
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,755
- Well done.
- Come on. Go.

387
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:36,654
Shaw, stop. You don't understand.

388
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,575
- Where is he?
- He's not coming.

389
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,911
He can't.

390
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:07,935
A gun fight?

391
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,354
Is that what you really want?

392
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,980
Do you have one good flash left?

393
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,320
I saved the best for last.

394
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:50,978
I'm waiting, Chuck.

395
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:06,869
Wake up in the mornin'
And I raise my weary head

396
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:12,458
I got an old coat for a pillow
And the earth was last night's bed

397
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:18,172
I don't know where I'm going
Only God knows where I've been

398
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:21,592
I'm a devil on the run
A six-gun lover

399
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,552
A candle in the wind

400
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:29,349
Shot down in a blaze of glory

401
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:34,354
Take me now
But know the truth

402
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:40,360
I'm going down in a blaze of glory

403
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:42,070
Please stop it, Shaw.

404
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,491
But Lord I'm no one's son

405
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:50,412
Call me young gun

406
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:54,208
Chuck?

407
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,544
Chuck. Please. Chuck, please wake up.

408
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:08,180
Hey, Dad.

409
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,766
Charles, I'll be back in a second.

410
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,189
Chuck.

411
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:03,485
Chuck, are you all right?

412
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:06,363
Are you all right? Did you--? Did you--?

413
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,410
It was a complete transfer.

414
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:13,287
Empty files.

415
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,374
The whole system went into you-- Your--

416
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:20,544
You processed
an incredible amount of data.

417
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:23,130
But you're okay.

418
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,508
What does that mean?

419
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:29,803
Hang on. Stay with me. Stay with me.
You're gonna be okay.

420
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:32,973
You're special, son.

421
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:36,101
It means you're special.

422
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,395
You're special.

423
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,480
You're special, son.

424
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,357
It means you're special.

425
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:44,776
Please, Chuck. Come on.

426
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:49,740
Shaw, stop it.

427
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,290
Chuck?

428
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:02,836
- Chuck?
- Sorry...

429
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:05,297
...just had to reboot.

430
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:48,340
You have to do it.

431
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:51,927
You have to kill me.

432
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,101
No, thanks.

433
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,979
I've already done that once before.

434
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:04,940
That's what makes you weak.

435
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,989
No, that's what makes you great.

436
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,833
Your dad wanted you to have this.

437
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:07,544
This is not good. I am definitely
gonna be fired tomorrow.

438
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,339
No.

439
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:14,342
Big Mike, sir.

440
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,928
What if I told you
there was another way?

441
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:19,973
A way we could save our jobs.
Be heroes.

442
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:22,726
Do tell, Barnes. Do tell.

443
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,519
We burn the Buy More.

444
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,064
Burn it down to the ground.

445
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,565
Burn down what?

446
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,484
It'd be my honor to do that for you.

447
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:31,985
That's it.

448
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,987
I have had it with you two.

449
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:37,115
You have brought me nothing
but pain and misery.

450
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:39,451
You, answering phones
that ain't ringing.

451
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:42,079
And you, your singing voice
is a vocal felony.

452
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:48,335
With that, good night, good riddance,
and goodbye.

453
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,964
- None of these firemen are real?
- CIA cleaners.

454
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:55,425
They're looking for Shaw's detonator.

455
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:58,512
Good work today. Takes something
special to break your thumbs.

456
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:01,723
It's nothing. They're just thumbs.
What any good partner would do.

457
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:04,392
- Will you tell Beckman of my exploits?
- Depends.

458
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,853
Why did you have
my daughter's phone number?

459
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,065
Oh. Ah, ah.

460
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:20,075
Sarah, I told Ellie that I'd quit after
we stopped The Ring. And I meant it.

461
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,161
I can't lie to her.

462
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:27,249
You think you could love a regular guy?

463
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,919
Well, I fell in love with a regular guy.

464
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:33,755
Hey.

465
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:36,675
Found the detonator.

466
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:39,219
Found the detonator.
Am I on some hero streak?

467
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,972
- Man, when you're hot you're hot.
- Careful with that.

468
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,640
Tell Beckman of my exploits.

469
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,059
How I broke my thumbs,
how I found the detonator?

470
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,520
- Dude is gonna drop it.
- And how I-- Dropped it.

471
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:51,106
I can't believe I just did that.

472
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:55,443
Bombs are armed, everybody. Run!

473
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:58,155
I'm sorry, everybody.
Sorry, it was an accident.

474
00:35:58,406 --> 00:35:59,447
- Come on.
- Get out!

475
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:01,283
- Go.
- Get back. Get back.

476
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:18,842
- Did we do that?
- I don't know.

477
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:22,262
- Start the van.
- It was an accident.

478
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,184
All in an orderly fashion.

479
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:33,023
We need everyone to get out
of the store right now.

480
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:36,693
Sir, ma'am, this way.

481
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,737
Sweet Lord, they did it.

482
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:40,488
They actually did it.

483
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:43,200
Those crazy nerds blew up
the freaking Buy More.

484
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:44,659
In our top story tonight...

485
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:48,622
...it's been 24 hours since the
Burbank Buy More burned to the ground.

486
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:52,459
And police have had no luck in
apprehending the two lead suspects.

487
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:56,922
These two men are on the run
and considered extremely dangerous.

488
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:58,882
If you encounter these fugitives...

489
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:02,135
...please call your local authorities
immediately.

490
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,429
And in other--

491
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,806
- Thanks, buddy.
- Of course, touch-up.

492
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,434
Um, ahem.

493
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:12,103
We didn't always think
he was the greatest family man.

494
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:17,150
But we know that there was nothing
more important to him than family.

495
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:24,157
To a great man.

496
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,660
Stephen J. Bartowski.

497
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,245
To Dad.

498
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:49,516
- Hi.
- Hi. I hope I didn't miss dinner.

499
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,351
No. No, come in, please.

500
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,812
Welcome to la casa de Bartowski.

501
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,523
- Alex, this is my sister, Ellie.
- Hi.

502
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:59,818
And that's Devon,
her husband back there.

503
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:04,823
I'm just so glad you came.

504
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:06,533
Me too.

505
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:10,996
Okay.

506
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,504
Well, he's not much of a hugger,
but baby steps, right?

507
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:23,383
Glad to see you, Alex.
I too am glad that you came--

508
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:26,720
Step aside before I break
the rest of your fingers.

509
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:29,097
Or you blow up the apartment.

510
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:31,266
That's low, Casey.
Okay, it was an accident.

511
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:33,059
- Chuck, it was an accident.
- I know.

512
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:35,061
That was an accident.

513
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,940
So, Chuck, are you done? For real?

514
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:46,072
I told Beckman that I'm out.

515
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,742
I mean, after all, I did get her
her job back...

516
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:51,953
...and saved multiple branches
of the United States government...

517
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:53,371
...so she accepted.

518
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,415
I'm a civilian. Just like you.

519
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:58,168
Really?

520
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:01,546
You were right, sis. There's nothing
more important than family.

521
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:07,177
- Love you.
- I love you too.

522
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:38,333
Oh, boy.

523
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:51,304
Hello, Chuck. If you're seeing this...

524
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:54,682
...that means I wasn't able to stop
this message from sending.

525
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,352
Which also means I'm dead.

526
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:59,562
What do I say about that?

527
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:04,359
Um... I'm sorry and...

528
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:08,571
Well, I hope you and your sister
know how much I love you.

529
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:13,493
Loved you.

530
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:17,580
Now I need you to do something
for me, Charles.

531
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:20,542
Something secret. You better get a pen.

532
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:26,965
I never wanted you to be a spy.

533
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:31,845
I knew how dangerous this world is,
what it does to the people in it.

534
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,139
Boy, do I know that.

535
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:37,809
That's why I kept something from you.

536
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:41,354
Something about me. About Orion.

537
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:43,314
Charles, I'll be back in a second.

538
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:44,691
Hey, Dad.

539
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:54,909
I've been a spy for the last 20 years.

540
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:57,203
Working for myself...

541
00:40:57,371 --> 00:41:00,457
...doing things governments
are afraid to do.

542
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:12,844
Maybe being a spy is-- Is in our blood.

543
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,890
And maybe I should have told you...

544
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:18,892
...all of this long ago.

545
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:21,436
But, Chuck...

546
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:25,773
...your story, it's only just beginning.

547
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:32,113
It's time you know the truth
about my work...

548
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:36,075
...and about the people who tried
to destroy me, because if I'm gone...

549
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:39,162
...then you're not safe from them
anymore.

550
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,914
And neither is Ellie.

551
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:49,881
These people,
they are ruthless, cunning and--

552
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:55,887
Chuck, it's time you learned
about your family.

553
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:02,936
Because...

554
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:06,231
...I did it all for her.

555
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:11,110
Yes?

556
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:13,488
We're going to have to move you.

557
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:15,156
Now.

558
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:20,203
Mom.
