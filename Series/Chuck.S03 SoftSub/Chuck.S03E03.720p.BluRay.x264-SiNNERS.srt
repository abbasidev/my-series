1
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:09,341
Let's jump right in.

2
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:13,595
Who would like to help me dissect
the branches of the femoral artery?

3
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:14,847
Anyone?

4
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:18,058
No one? Fine.

5
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:22,146
How about Mr. Woodcomb? Devon?

6
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:25,983
Devon? It seems Devon
has more pressing concerns...

7
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:28,402
...on his first day of medical school.

8
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:33,323
So perhaps Miss Eleanor Bartowski
would like to give me a hand?

9
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:39,496
Well, wherever Mr. Woodcomb
and Miss Bartowski are...

10
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:42,916
...I hope they are gaining an appreciation
of the human body.

11
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,091
- What did you say your name was?
- Devon.

12
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:52,426
- Yours?
- Ellie.

13
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,470
It's a pleasure to meet you, Ellie.

14
00:00:56,306 --> 00:01:00,100
I don't normally make out with strangers
in broom closets like this.

15
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,853
We're not strangers, remember?

16
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:05,064
I'm Devon. You're Ellie.

17
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:13,238
Oh, God, I love med school.

18
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:17,785
Broom. Broom, broom.

19
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,621
Have you seen the broom?

20
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:24,416
Can you forget the TV?
I broke another of our wedding plates.

21
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:27,586
I can do this.
I just have to channel my inner Chuck.

22
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,255
Chuck who? That person's dead to me.

23
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:33,425
Relax, babe. I have nine years
of postgraduate education.

24
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,761
I can figure out a stupid TV set.

25
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,222
He said he was gonna help us move.
No excuses.

26
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:41,934
Well, honey, you remember how it is.
He's young, fancy-free.

27
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,728
Probably just slipped his mind.

28
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:49,608
Honey, look at this.

29
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,777
This is our wedding album.

30
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:55,614
Is it just me, or does this feel
like a million years ago?

31
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:00,410
What happened to us?

32
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:05,040
Well, we moved.
We went back to work.

33
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,500
Real life happened.

34
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,545
Well, when do we get to take a break
from real life?

35
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,756
When do we get to be
these people again?

36
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:16,343
Okay. Here's the deal.

37
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,387
Enough moving for one night.

38
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,556
I'm gonna get us some real food...

39
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:24,059
...we're gonna sit on this couch,
and watch our wedding video.

40
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:27,312
And then, maybe later,
we can re-create our wedding night.

41
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,900
What about the TV?

42
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:35,404
That's a job for a professional.

43
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:40,367
Is it just me, or has there been, like,
a lot of helicopters lately?

44
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:42,786
Hmm.

45
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,663
Hadn't noticed.

46
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:51,628
Aah!

47
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:54,006
Sorry, dude. Didn't mean to scare you.

48
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:59,636
Really? Then you shouldn't be sneaking
into my room in the middle of the night.

49
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:03,432
Then maybe you should tell your pilot
to land farther from the apartment.

50
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:07,144
Oh. Right. Sorry about that.

51
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:12,149
The thing is, he doesn't really know
the Echo Park area all that well...

52
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:15,694
...but we'll work on that.

53
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,780
Can you do me a favor
and help me get out of this thing here?

54
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:21,033
- Pull down on that.
- Where were you tonight?

55
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,535
You told Ellie you were gonna help us
set up the TV.

56
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:27,289
- She's a little pissed, bro.
- Oh, man. My bad.

57
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:30,167
I had a CIA mission.

58
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,211
What exactly does that mean?

59
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,339
Well, you know, same old, same old.

60
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:39,176
Bad guy throws a cocktail party,
another's trying to sell him a weapon.

61
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:43,055
We bust both bad guys,
defuse a bomb, blah, blah, blah.

62
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,724
That sounds kind of kickass.

63
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,144
- What do you got under there?
- Body armor.

64
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:53,857
Leave that on when you come over.
Like I said, your sister's about to blow.

65
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:57,611
All right.

66
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,906
You could have been a surgeon
with those hands.

67
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:04,409
He could have been a lot of things.
I would settle for being on time.

68
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,621
That should do it.

69
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,415
Try it now.

70
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,920
It has been reported Premier
Alejandro Goya collapsed shortly...

71
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:18,298
Yeah. Oh, look at that.
I take it back. You're a genius.

72
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,801
- I'm gonna get the wedding DVD.
- This visit to the U.S...

73
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:24,513
...is the first for the outspoken
Costa Gravan leader.

74
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:30,185
Goya has ruled his small nation
ever since a communist coup in 1974.

75
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:41,571
Speaking of collapsing,
Chuck, you okay?

76
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,200
Huh? What? Yes.

77
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:48,370
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm a little lightheaded, that's all.

78
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,584
- I gotta run.
- What is it? Another mission, huh?

79
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:57,879
- Something with the premier?
- I'm sorry, buddy. It's spy stuff.

80
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,131
It's confidential.

81
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,720
Where are you going?

82
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,348
- Sorry, buddy, doctor stuff. Confidential.
- Hmm.

83
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,561
Hey, what happened
to re-creating our wedding night?

84
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:16,815
Sorry, babe, duty calls.
I will make it up to you. I promise.

85
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:23,447
The Costa Gravan premier
is listed in critical condition.

86
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:25,741
Outstanding. Wanna crack the bubbly?

87
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,826
No. I want you to go to the hospital...

88
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:31,455
...and guard against further threats
to his life, natural or otherwise.

89
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:33,915
But haven't you personally
given me the order...

90
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,585
...to kill that commie crackpot
on three occasions?

91
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:40,005
And three times,
you have failed to complete your orders.

92
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,507
I thought you said
you had a perfect record.

93
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:46,136
Wow, this is getting
entertainingly uncomfortable.

94
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,889
Our relations with Costa Gravas
have changed, colonel.

95
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,892
The premier is here to announce plans
to open his nation...

96
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,519
- ...to democratic elections.
- Oh. And you believe that?

97
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,980
Our duty is to stop anyone
who would stop him...

98
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,691
...from going through with his plan.
Understood?

99
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,944
- Yes, ma'am.
- So this was an assassination attempt?

100
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:05,781
We're not assuming anything
until we've secured his medical records.

101
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:08,033
That brings me to your assignment.

102
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:11,119
- The premier is being treated at--
- Let me guess.

103
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:13,705
- Westside Medical?
- Correct.

104
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,556
Everybody, relax. The doctor's here.

105
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:35,727
General, are you suggesting that I exploit
my sister and-or brother-in-law...

106
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:39,189
...to acquire confidential medical records
for governmental use?

107
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,983
Yes, Chuck,
that's exactly what I'm suggesting.

108
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:44,111
I knew it. I was on it. Wait, hold on.

109
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:48,698
And if anything happens to the premier,
I'm holding you responsible.

110
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,705
If anything happens to this man,
I'm holding you responsible.

111
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,124
In a miraculous turn of events...

112
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,461
...the Costa Gravan premier
is being released from the hospital...

113
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:46,047
...just hours after being rushed
to the emergency room.

114
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:49,468
Right now, we go to Westside Medical
for a live press conference.

115
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,470
Dr. Woodcomb, Dr. Woodcomb.

116
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:54,139
It was reported
the premier suffered heart failure.

117
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:57,267
- How do you account for his recovery?
- I can only say this:

118
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,895
The premier is an amazing man.
A real fighter.

119
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:02,189
I'm gonna be sick.

120
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:08,778
What is the probability
of the premier returning to work?

121
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,703
Is there anything
your brother-in-law can't do?

122
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,914
Well, thus the nickname.

123
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:21,082
Okay, enough sitting around.

124
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,793
We need to figure out
what happened to the premier.

125
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:26,171
Let's apprehend the doctor,
get those records.

126
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,966
Nobody is apprehending anybody.
He's family. I can talk to him.

127
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:32,802
Just remember, Chuck,
he's a civilian, so be cool.

128
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,721
Hello. Heh.

129
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,980
Sorry, bro, didn't mean to scare you.

130
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,774
You didn't.

131
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,735
I didn't?

132
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,154
Whatever.

133
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:55,283
Listen, there's a few questions
I need to ask you.

134
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,118
It's about the premier, right?

135
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:01,790
Sure you wanna
talk about this here? Hm?

136
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,751
Doesn't the CIA want to debrief me
or something?

137
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,920
I am debriefing you.

138
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,965
That's what I'm doing right now.
This is a debriefing.

139
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:11,550
I mean, in your secret base?

140
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,094
Secret? You watch too many movies.

141
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,638
Just tell me what you know
about the premier.

142
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:20,725
I know he didn't have a heart attack.
His potassium level was off the charts.

143
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,436
- How it got into his system--
- He was poisoned.

144
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,689
Okay, that's all I needed to know.
Thanks.

145
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:29,484
Whoa, Chuck. You know,
if there's anything else I can do...

146
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:32,696
- No, you've been great.
- No, seriously.

147
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:35,657
If the CIA needs
an extra set of hands?

148
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,786
- Good to know.
- Chuck, you're not hearing me, okay?

149
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:43,206
Nothing against married life,
but I could use some real excitement.

150
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:46,585
Devon, you're an adventure-sports
cardiologist.

151
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,170
Whatever, man.
I can do that in my sleep.

152
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,881
I need some real action.
Some real adrenaline.

153
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:54,551
I wanna feel like
I felt out on the football field.

154
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:57,137
- You know, I can still run a 4.440.
- Great.

155
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,389
We need a tight end,
you're the first call.

156
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:03,893
But until then, you're my brother-in-law.
Ellie would kill me.

157
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,188
Thanks to your
brother-in-law's intelligence...

158
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,983
...we have to assume
that the assassin is still in play.

159
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:13,028
There's an event at the Costa Gravan
consulate this evening.

160
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,030
I need your team to guard the premier.

161
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,991
- You want us to break in?
- That's invading sovereign soil.

162
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,453
That is why the CIA has
no official knowledge of this mission.

163
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,622
Ah, just spitballing here, general.

164
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,333
Why don't we tell the premier
his life is in danger?

165
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,877
Would you trust a country
that spent the better part...

166
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,837
...of three decades trying to kill you?

167
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:35,425
- Heh. Yeah.
- Your protection must go undetected.

168
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,762
What? So that's it?

169
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:41,181
If we get busted,
then the CIA disavows us...

170
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,975
...and we rot for the rest of our lives
in a prison?

171
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,479
In Costa Gravas, the punishment
for sedition is death by firing squad.

172
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,732
Just my kind of mission.
Too bad I have to recuse myself.

173
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,443
What? He's bailing--?
You're bailing on us?

174
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,446
I can't show my face on
Costa Gravan soil. I'm a wanted man.

175
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,742
You know what they'd do
if they knew I was in Los Angeles?

176
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,663
I spilled more blood in that
Mickey Mouse revolution than any other--

177
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:07,582
Think you're being paranoid?

178
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:11,920
They called me el Angel de la Muerte:
The Angel of Death.

179
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:15,590
Please, bro, it was the '80s. Come on.

180
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:19,260
You really think the premier gives
a flying crap about you, John Casey?

181
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:22,681
Oh, no, is the Angel of Death.

182
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:30,897
Casey, those aren't--? Oh, boy.

183
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:34,275
At last. They've come for me.

184
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:42,200
I can take a few of these commies
with me. Ready?

185
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:46,913
No, not ready. Wait one second.

186
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:50,291
They are not here for you, Casey.
They are here for--

187
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,837
Devon?

188
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:56,214
Kind of in the middle of something,
babe.

189
00:11:57,591 --> 00:12:00,593
Baby, I've been on call
for three straight days.

190
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,804
I know, hon.
And I haven't worked out...

191
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,807
...since we moved in.
Gotta keep my heart rate in the red.

192
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:07,809
Don't open the door.

193
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:10,645
Okay. Okay.

194
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,648
Pick up the phone. Pick up the phone.

195
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,069
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

196
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:26,953
Make it stop. Make it stop.

197
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,163
I got it, babe.

198
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,963
Dr. Woodcomb.

199
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:41,426
- Um, yeah?
- Dr. Devon Woodcomb.

200
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,555
- That's me.
- You have any idea what you've done...

201
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,099
...Dr. Devon Woodcomb?

202
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:52,353
You saved my life.

203
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,526
How can I ever hope to repay you?

204
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,988
Okay, how about
we just keep it down.

205
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:05,867
- Devon, who are these people?
- Alejandro Fulgencio Goya.

206
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:10,163
I am the master of parliament and
chief military officer of Costa Gravas.

207
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:12,874
I am at your most humble service.

208
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:16,252
- What is going on?
- You must be Señora Woodcomb?

209
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,171
Actually, I'm a doctor too.

210
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,174
All right. Stay put, I'm going in.

211
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:26,012
You're a doctor? You know,
I didn't think such beauty still exists.

212
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,640
Not from beyond the shores
of Costa Gravas, huh?

213
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,100
Well, it's nice to meet you.

214
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:33,186
- How do you know Devon?
- You don't know?

215
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:36,314
I was gonna tell you
when you woke up, honey.

216
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,191
Ah. Such modesty.

217
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,485
Your husband's a hero.

218
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,199
I owe him my life.

219
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,994
There is a gala this evening
at my consulate.

220
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,622
If you will both be my guests of honor...

221
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,123
...I would be humbled.

222
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,505
He's waiting for you to say yes.

223
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,340
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, yes.

224
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,217
Splendid. I will see you tonight.

225
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,304
Hey, did somebody say something
about a gala?

226
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:10,515
Hi. Sorry. Easy there.

227
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,809
Sir, this is my brother, Chuck.

228
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,435
He's your brother?

229
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,313
- Thank you.
- Ah!

230
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,649
The resemblance. I see.

231
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:23,111
- Your family has such delicate features.
- Thank you.

232
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,405
Much more suitable on a woman,
though, huh?

233
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:26,823
- Fair enough.
Ha-ha-ha.

234
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:30,577
If he is half the man you are,
you bring him as well, hm?

235
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,246
A military escort will be here at 7.

236
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,758
- I can't believe this is happening.
- Wow!

237
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:57,270
- I can't believe this is happening.
- I spent a year on Secret Service.

238
00:14:57,479 --> 00:15:00,315
I'm sure I can protect
one small-time dictator.

239
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:02,400
The dictator's not
who I'm worried about.

240
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,030
Is this romantic enough for you?

241
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:10,033
Devon, it's perfect.

242
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,331
Look, I know you're nervous...

243
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:19,459
...but I also know how the Intersect
works when you get nervous.

244
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:23,254
If you really wanna protect them,
then you're gonna have to focus.

245
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:31,679
Casey, I've got guards with submachine
guns at both the north and west exits.

246
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:35,058
Yeah, copy that.
Main doors have hidden metal detectors.

247
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,268
Go around back,
check the service entrance.

248
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,771
I'll check on the premier.
Rendezvous in five.

249
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,815
Chuck, keep a lookout
for any potential assassins.

250
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,667
What's the plan, bro?

251
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:03,044
CIA gonna whack the premier?

252
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,672
Nobody is going to be
whacking anybody, okay?

253
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,424
- That's why we're here.
- Ah, I get it.

254
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:11,719
We're on the counteroffensive.
What's my mission?

255
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,638
Your mission?

256
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,015
Your mission-- Oh, hold on a second.
It's Langley.

257
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,892
What are they telling me? Oh.

258
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,980
They want you to stop screwing around,
okay? To keep my sister out of danger.

259
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:25,608
To not take your eyes off her all night.
You think you can handle that, 007?

260
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,610
Uh, Chuck?

261
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:34,033
I can't take my eyes off of you.

262
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,703
You must stay next to me
all night long.

263
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,287
And whatever comes after.

264
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:47,714
My wife is talking to the target
of an assassination plot.

265
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:50,550
We gotta get her out of there.
I'm going in.

266
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:54,929
Awesome, calm down.
Let a professional handle this.

267
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:57,557
I hope I'm not interrupting.

268
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:01,936
No, no. Sarah, this is the premier.

269
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,564
- Call me generalissimo.
- An honor to meet you, sir.

270
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:08,943
You don't have to say it. My doctor
tells me to avoid this stimulation.

271
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,279
But then again,
my doctor is your husband.

272
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:18,244
Well, I'm so sorry, but I need to borrow
her for a second, generalissimo.

273
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,663
- Girl talk.
- Excuse me. We'll be right back.

274
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,124
- She's good.
- The best.

275
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:28,087
Thank God you rescued me. That guy's
cologne was practically a WMD.

276
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,383
So, what did you wanna talk
to me about?

277
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,141
I'm sorry. Of course. Of course,
this must be really hard for you guys.

278
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,853
- Yeah, it is.
- I mean, one minute, you're broken up...

279
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:47,190
...and then the next minute,
you're on this incredibly sexy date.

280
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:49,817
So, what's the deal with you guys?

281
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:52,653
I mean, not to be crass or anything...

282
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:55,490
...but you and Sarah ever,
like... you know?

283
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:56,657
No.

284
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,451
- Never?
- Nope.

285
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:01,829
Huh. I always thought
you guys were like a real couple.

286
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,043
Do you still have feelings
for my brother?

287
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,212
No, no. We're--

288
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,048
Chuck and I are just friends.

289
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,842
Sarah, please,
look at yourself right now.

290
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,386
I mean, look at the dress.
Look me in the eye...

291
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:19,514
...and tell me
you guys are just friends.

292
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:25,853
Yeah, it's our job
to fool people like you.

293
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,314
Wow. That must be hard.

294
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,566
Not just the "not having sex" part.

295
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:32,360
That must be excruciating.

296
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:37,824
But having to fake like you're in love
with someone for almost three years...

297
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:41,160
...especially someone like her...

298
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:45,706
...how do you do it, Chuck?
How do you not fall for her?

299
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:52,588
I don't think that you understand
our situation.

300
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:55,049
I understand completely. I do.

301
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:58,052
You know, you go through
hot and cold patches.

302
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:02,181
When Devon and I got married,
we kind of put the passion on hold...

303
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:07,562
...but being here in a place like this,
it just brings it all back, you know?

304
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:11,107
It feels like it did in the beginning.

305
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,026
All right, ladies.

306
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:17,613
Yeah, I'm talking to you too, Bartowski.
Enough with the chitchat.

307
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:21,200
Let's get back to protecting
our foreign head of state, shall we?

308
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:26,372
Friends, expatriates, countrymen.

309
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,041
Oh, great, a speech.
It makes him a walking target.

310
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:31,919
It's so good to be here with all of you.

311
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:35,089
I see many of my old comrades
here tonight.

312
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,633
Men who never dreamed...

313
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:42,263
...one day we'd meet in the heart
of this capitalist beast...

314
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:44,932
...Los Angeles.

315
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,898
And I see new faces here tonight
as well. Americanos.

316
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,942
They never dreamed that one night...

317
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:59,447
...they would be dining and dancing
in the soil of Costa Gravas. Hey!

318
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:03,951
Goya! Goya! Goya!

319
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,453
No, no. No, no.

320
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:10,791
To symbolize this historic meeting
of two great nations...

321
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:17,131
...I would like to invite
Mrs. Dr. Woodcomb to this dance.

322
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,968
Oh, I couldn't possibly.

323
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,849
Listen, relax.
You know what they say?

324
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,645
When in Costa Gravas...

325
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:10,810
I ran the guest list.

326
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,521
Got a hit. Subject entered
on a stolen passport.

327
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,731
I'm uploading you the photo
right now.

328
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,192
Huh.

329
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,069
Charming. Who is he?

330
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,905
Real name's Pablo Alarcón.
Freedom fighter.

331
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,908
Guy spent 20 years
in a Costa Gravan prison...

332
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,703
...for trying to overthrow
the communist party.

333
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,546
- Sarah.
- Okay, I see him.

334
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:41,215
We need to take him out
before the guards see us.

335
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,550
We're on Costa Gravan soil.

336
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,469
They will arrest us
if we make a move toward the premier.

337
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,888
We need to get across the dance floor.

338
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,409
Chuck?

339
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,911
Just follow my lead, huh?

340
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:20,379
There he is.

341
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:51,160
The assassin is behind you.
Take him out.

342
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:52,995
Three, two, one!

343
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,838
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

344
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,802
- What is it?
- False alarm.

345
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:10,930
- He's just a political protester.
- Yeah. Casey, guess what.

346
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:13,682
Your assassin was carrying nothing
but a rotten egg.

347
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,769
Take him and his date.
Let them sober up in the alleyway.

348
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:19,021
What? No, I'm sober. I'm sober.

349
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,107
Listen, it's a misunderstanding, okay?

350
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:35,830
Wait. No, no! You don't understand!
The premier's life is in danger.

351
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:38,374
I'm just a bad dancer.
It was an accident.

352
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:39,625
No! No!

353
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:42,795
That guy we just passed,
that other guard, he is the assassin.

354
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,713
- What happened?
- Casey, do you copy?

355
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:47,174
I'm out of position.
The premier is unprotected.

356
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:49,343
We need you in here.

357
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:50,845
This way.

358
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,030
Comrade.

359
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:13,534
Doesn't it feel like anything
can happen tonight, honey?

360
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:33,804
Honey? Honey?

361
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,444
Casey?

362
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,412
El Angel de la Muerte.

363
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,588
Oh, my God! Devon, what happened?

364
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:11,550
- Excuse me.
- I can't believe you saved my life...

365
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:13,052
...again.

366
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,721
You saved the general
from an assassin?

367
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:18,098
I can't believe you just did that.

368
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,101
I can't believe it either.

369
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:27,107
What do you mean "wait"?

370
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:31,362
Look, general, I hate to interrupt
your little cocktail party...

371
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,905
...but we got a man down.

372
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,573
I appreciate your loyalty.

373
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:36,909
Send in the black ops,
storm the consulate.

374
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:40,412
Costa Gravan soil be damned.
Casey was doing his job.

375
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,791
Given Casey's history,
just imagine what they're doing to him.

376
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,710
We will do everything we can
to get the colonel back...

377
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,963
...using diplomatic channels.

378
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,714
Diplomatic channels? General.

379
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:53,050
We can't upset relations
with Costa Gravas.

380
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,802
Their future is in the balance.

381
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,137
Until the premier makes
his announcement...

382
00:25:57,305 --> 00:26:00,140
...I'm afraid Colonel Casey
will have to handle himself.

383
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:03,894
It's been a long time.

384
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:08,649
When are you going to learn
you do not have the strength to kill me?

385
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,317
I'm here to protect you.

386
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,486
The Angel of Death?

387
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,655
You're here to protect me?
Protect me how?

388
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:16,073
Like in '83?

389
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,825
- You put a bullet in my spleen.
- Yeah.

390
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:20,494
Or in '88, you blew up my dog, Chuy.

391
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:24,498
Sorry about the dog.
Obviously, the bomb was meant for you.

392
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:30,087
I don't know,
maybe I'm just a humble dictator.

393
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,672
How stupid do you think I am?

394
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,842
I don't think you're stupid.
Your life is in danger, you idiot.

395
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:36,510
Enough.

396
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:39,638
This imperialist lies.

397
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:43,017
Who you calling "imperialist,"
you commie bastard?

398
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:44,351
I need some sleep.

399
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:47,938
You know, tomorrow,
I'll conduct your interrogation myself.

400
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,986
I'll do it personally.

401
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,155
Generalissimo...

402
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:58,949
...your cigar.

403
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,890
- This is genuine Costa Gravan tobacco.
Mm-mm.

404
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:25,392
Rolled on the thighs of virgins.

405
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:36,862
Perhaps you deserve one final smoke.

406
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,241
No.

407
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:53,545
- Thank you.
- For what?

408
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:55,255
For tonight.

409
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:58,759
For making me forget about all of this.

410
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,262
Do you remember our first day
of medical school?

411
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:08,644
You know, this place
has some very nice closets.

412
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,312
Oh.

413
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:18,529
Mm-mm. No phones tonight. You said.

414
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,864
I will turn it off.

415
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,702
It's the consulate.
The premier wants to see me.

416
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:26,745
Some kind of emergency.

417
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:33,711
Hold on to that feeling.
I will be right back.

418
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,594
Chuck, I think I can help
get Casey back.

419
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:46,306
Unless you can get in without starting
some incident, I'm not interested.

420
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:47,933
That's exactly what I can do.

421
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:50,227
I got a call.
The premier collapsed again.

422
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:52,813
His last request was for me
to be his doctor.

423
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:57,818
Devon, if you think
this is your chance to be a big spy--

424
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,445
My chance to set things right.

425
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:03,198
I'll get you inside then, I promise,
I will leave the spy stuff to the pros.

426
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:09,747
I knew you guys had a secret base.

427
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,291
This is badass.

428
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:15,627
- Don't touch anything.
- Cool.

429
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:18,672
- What are you doing?
- We're not sure where Casey's being held.

430
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,300
I'm pulling up the schematics
for the consulate.

431
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:24,011
- Where's Sarah?
- We'll call her. If she knew we were here--

432
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:27,014
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

433
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:30,184
- What do you think you're doing?
- Bringing a civilian in here?

434
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:32,519
Any idea how far off
the reservation you've gone?

435
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:35,314
What do you call invading foreign soil
against orders?

436
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:36,523
I have no choice.

437
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,276
We're coming with you.

438
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,863
No, trust me. You don't want any part
of this and neither do you.

439
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:45,991
I thought you didn't want
your family messed up with the CIA.

440
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,453
Okay, look, before you go running off
and getting yourself shot...

441
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,955
...Devon thinks he can get us
into the consulate.

442
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:55,000
The premier has invited him
to be his personal physician.

443
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,211
- Okay, here's the plan--
- Stop right there.

444
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:58,879
I am way ahead of you.

445
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:14,895
I'm Dr. Woodcomb.
We're here to see the premier.

446
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:21,026
- You can do this, Devon.
- Just relax.

447
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:41,296
Hello, John Casey, NSA assassin.

448
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,843
- Who are you?
- The man who's going to kill you.

449
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:48,887
Obviously. Who do you work for?

450
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:52,015
Professional courtesy.
One assassin to another.

451
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:55,185
I work for an organization
known as The Ring.

452
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:02,901
- You want me to work in here?
- Is there a problem?

453
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:05,153
- He needs to move to a hospital.
- Why?

454
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:07,990
So you North Americans can try
and kill him yet again?

455
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:10,534
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
The premier's orders were clear.

456
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:14,037
Acute arrhythmia.
This guy's hating life.

457
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:17,875
Don't forget, Dr. Woodcomb,
if anything happens to the premier--

458
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,085
Yeah, I heard you the first time.

459
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:22,504
All right, team, let's get to work.

460
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:24,840
What does this Ring have
against the premier?

461
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,466
Nothing personal.

462
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:29,887
I suppose I could explain
our overarching goals...

463
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:33,640
...but this might tax the brain
of an aging NSA agent.

464
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:38,687
Let's just say The Ring wishes
to preserve Costa Gravas' status quo.

465
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:41,773
The premier must die. So must you.

466
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:43,650
This guy's in big trouble.

467
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:46,904
I need 10 units of insulin.

468
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,450
Red bottle, yellow label.

469
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:55,579
On a personal note,
I must say, I've studied your work.

470
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,248
Some of your kills in the '90s
weren't bad.

471
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:01,126
Unfortunately, in our game...

472
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:06,089
...you're only as good as your last kill.

473
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:07,799
So you come up with a plan yet?

474
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:12,346
Oh, yeah. Yeah, the plan is Sarah and I
are gonna sneak out and save Casey.

475
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:15,557
You stay, save the premier.
We gotta take care of those guards.

476
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:18,769
Those two soldiers with machine guns?
You and what army?

477
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:22,606
That would be Sarah and her fists.

478
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,024
Bring it on, tough guy.

479
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:27,527
A thousand Costa Gravan pesos says
I walk out of here.

480
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:31,782
There's enough poison in this needle
to kill an army platoon.

481
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:35,535
Well, lucky for me, I'm a Marine.

482
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:54,179
Relax.

483
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:12,406
- Let's go.
- That is some woman, bro.

484
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:14,533
You have no idea.

485
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,583
You owe me 15 American cents.

486
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,091
Angel de la Muerte?

487
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:38,348
- Let's get out of this banana republic.
- We've gotta get Awesome.

488
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:41,143
You brought your brother-in-law?
What were you thinking?

489
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,562
Devon, we gotta get out of here.

490
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,856
No, you get out.
Guards are looking for you.

491
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,482
Besides, he'll die without me.

492
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:51,737
We're all gonna die if they find us here.
We've done what we needed to do.

493
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,697
Sorry, Chuck. My mission's not over.

494
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:57,284
That man you're trying to save
turned his country into a pariah state.

495
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,745
Do you have any idea
how many people he killed?

496
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:01,663
You're one to talk.

497
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:05,292
Angel de la Muerte.

498
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:09,004
Look, look, he's not here
as the Angel of Death right now.

499
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:11,173
He's here to protect your boss.
We all are.

500
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,759
- The real killer's in my cell.
- We found no one.

501
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,639
Can't you see he's bleeding to death?
Please.

502
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:23,643
Sort out who's trying to kill who later.
We need to get this man to a doctor.

503
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:24,936
He has a doctor.

504
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:26,438
Little busy right now.

505
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,190
Not you, him.

506
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,026
Who "him"? Me "him"?

507
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:34,529
If you wish to prove
you're not an assassin, save him.

508
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,618
Okay.

509
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:42,454
Okay, no problem. No problem.

510
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:45,207
We've done this before.
We've done this many times.

511
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:47,751
Normally, I start with anesthesia.

512
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,628
- No.
- Huh?

513
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:56,843
Okay. Okay, no anesthesia.
No anesthesia. That's fine, that's fine.

514
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:59,137
He's a tough man.
He can deal with the pain.

515
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:02,015
The bullet might have grazed
his femoral artery. Whatever you do--

516
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,350
Eh, tsk, tsk, tsk.

517
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:05,977
Let the doctor work.

518
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:10,398
Nurse, why don't you cut
those pants open...

519
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:12,692
...and we'll see what
we're working with.

520
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,573
Oh. Oh.

521
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:21,243
It's suddenly very hot in here.
It's very, very hot.

522
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,286
- Can somebody crack a window or...?
- No.

523
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:25,914
Just as I thought.

524
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,878
Chuck, you've got the hands
of a surgeon, bro.

525
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:35,674
Don't think about the guns.
He's not your friend, he's your patient.

526
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:39,970
Chuck, you can do this. Just relax.

527
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,855
Nurse, suction.

528
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,358
Scalpel.

529
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:57,028
Tweezers.

530
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,031
Gauze.

531
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:01,825
Iodine.

532
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,703
Forceps.

533
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,915
Just like Operation.
You know, the game?

534
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:12,460
Ah!

535
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,764
- What's wrong?
- There's nothing I can do here.

536
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:28,685
Nothing short of a blood transfusion.
I don't even know what blood type he is.

537
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,022
- AB negative.
- What?

538
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,191
AB negative.

539
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:36,693
His blood type's AB negative.

540
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,363
You learn a lot about a guy
trying to kill him.

541
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:41,990
What else you wanna know?

542
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:44,075
Favorite movie's
Terms of Endearment.

543
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:47,204
He always showers after lovemaking.

544
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,039
None of that's gonna save him now.

545
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:52,584
We need someone with type
AB negative blood now. Someone big.

546
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:55,045
Does anyone have
type AB negative blood?

547
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,845
Hey, what are you doing?
Put those back.

548
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:06,681
- Give me that.
- I'm sorry, buddy.

549
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:11,019
You take one drop of blood from me,
I swear to God I'm gonna rip your--

550
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:15,398
No! No! No!

551
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,400
Whoo! Heh, heh.

552
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,833
Hey, Chucky.

553
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:38,463
Oh, I feel like death. What happened?

554
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:40,632
You're just in time, big boy.

555
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,841
Time for what?

556
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:44,844
Congratulations.
The premier made a full recovery.

557
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:47,264
Although I do not endorse
your methods...

558
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,307
...you enabled him
to make his announcement.

559
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:52,352
Costa Gravas will have
its first democratic election.

560
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:56,690
And it wouldn't have happened
without your extraordinary sacrifice.

561
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:00,694
Well, I got shot.
That's nothing extraordinary.

562
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:02,362
- You don't remember?
- Huh?

563
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,573
Remember what?

564
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,369
You stole my blood.

565
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:13,623
You stole my blood and you put it
in a stinking commie despot.

566
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:16,501
Former stinking commie despot,
thank you.

567
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:19,879
The premier wanted to thank you
personally, Colonel Casey.

568
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:22,382
But this will have to do.

569
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,842
Huh?

570
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:37,731
I wish to thank you
on behalf of Costa Gravas and myself.

571
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:42,402
I will never forget that the blood of an
American patriot flows through my veins.

572
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:47,699
John Casey, you truly are
the Angel of Life.

573
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,707
These are pre-revolutionary
Costa Gravas double coronas.

574
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:58,668
Ohh.

575
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:12,265
- Hey.
- Hey.

576
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:14,351
How'd it go with headquarters?

577
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:18,646
Yeah. Uh, we didn't get a new mission,
if that's what you're wondering.

578
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:22,650
Oh, no way.
I think I scratched my espionage itch.

579
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:24,402
Don't get me wrong.

580
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:28,198
Black tie dinners
and embassy extractions are killer...

581
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,283
...but just not worth it.

582
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:32,911
- What's not?
- If having a double life means...

583
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:38,124
...having to give up half of your real life,
that's just not how I wanna live, bro.

584
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:45,632
I gotta run. Gotta finish a few things
at the hospital...

585
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,634
...then get home to my wife.

586
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,803
You two take care of each other.

587
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:55,475
He would have made an awesome spy.

588
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,978
Yeah. Yeah, I guess it runs
in the family.

589
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:08,113
Uh, listen, I've been meaning to ask.

590
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:13,618
What do you think our cover should be,
you know, moving forward?

591
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,831
Well, I think we should keep it simple.

592
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:20,959
So how about friends?

593
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:23,920
Friends, huh?

594
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:27,715
Yeah, that could work.

595
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:32,095
I suppose I could fake being friends
with someone like you.

596
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,849
And I don't find you
completely repulsive...

597
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:37,517
Thanks.

598
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,352
...so, yeah, friends?

599
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:43,022
Yeah. Yeah, friends.

600
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,363
So, what exactly do friends do?

601
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:52,991
What do friends do?
Uh, what is it? Friday night?

602
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:56,494
Morgan and I would normally gorge
ourselves on some processed food...

603
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:57,996
...play some video games.

604
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:00,331
Maybe we're not quite there yet.

605
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:04,043
- We can work on some other options.
- Yeah.

606
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:05,503
- Hi.
- Hey, babe.

607
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:06,713
Where have you been?

608
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,883
Had a crazy night.
I got tied up at work.

609
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:13,052
Well, why don't you hurry home.

610
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,805
I have a surprise for you.

611
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,391
Well, one more patient
and I am on my way.

612
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:20,768
I believe I owe you a dance.

613
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:24,647
- I love you.
- I love you too.

614
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:32,155
So, what seems to be the problem?

615
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,577
Ooch. That looks like it hurts.

616
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:39,287
You have no idea.

617
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,170
Hey.

618
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,797
Change your mind about tonight?

619
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,675
What?

620
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,096
What is it?

621
00:41:58,432 --> 00:41:59,766
Devon's been...

622
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:09,067
Oh, my God.

623
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:13,530
Hey, guys.
Have you seen my husband?
