1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:05,087
Hi, I'm Chuck. Here's
a few things that you might need to know.

2
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:09,174
Devon is out of the spy business
for good.

3
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:11,885
- Please don't say another mission.
- You're back.

4
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:13,929
I'm Hannah.

5
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:16,932
If you ever find yourself in Burbank,
my assistant manager owes me...

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,600
...about a million and a half favors.

7
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:31,488
Stop the presses. Who is that?
Vicki Vale.

8
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:33,490
Vicki Vale, Vick, Vicki Vale

9
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:35,034
Vickity, vickity, Vicki Vale

10
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,453
Vick, va, Vicki Vale--

11
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:40,789
Remember when
Sarah first walked into the Buy More?

12
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:42,499
What was it like?

13
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:45,085
Was it love at first sight?

14
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,062
I don't know, but whatever it was,
it changed my life forever.

15
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,105
- Why?
- No reason.

16
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:07,024
- Morning, guys.
- Hi.

17
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,358
- Hi.
- Morning.

18
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,027
Right on time. Heh. Yes.

19
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:13,655
All right, everybody, back to work.

20
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,408
Real taskmaster, that, uh, Morgan.

21
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:18,494
Yeah, I can tell.

22
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:22,539
So my first day as a Nerd Herder.
Any advice?

23
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:26,043
Oh, uh, let's see--
Well, let's start with the 5-cent tour.

24
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:30,547
I like to consider myself the Jack Hanna
of this untamed wilderness.

25
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,801
Me, safe. Everyone else, very dangerous.

26
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:38,722
They all look creepy,
but I am that sure you will protect me.

27
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,516
Indeed. Indeed.

28
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:43,143
You stay by us, sister. You'll be safe.

29
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:46,021
- Charles.
- Hannah, Lester, Jeff.

30
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:49,274
Two of the finest members
of our Buy Moron staff.

31
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:50,859
Hannah, namaste.

32
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:54,655
Nice.

33
00:01:57,242 --> 00:02:00,828
All right. Give Jeff an opportunity
to realize that he's in public.

34
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:05,415
Thank you. So I was going through
the Nerd Herd manual...

35
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,918
...and I have a few questions
about how to file an install.

36
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,337
Let me get this straight.

37
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:13,215
You went over the Nerd Herd manual
in your off time?

38
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,800
Are you gonna be a problem?

39
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:18,262
I know this isn't my dream job,
but I thought that while I'm here...

40
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:20,514
...I would be the best Nerd Herder
you have.

41
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,934
Well, as you probably saw,
that's not an insurmountable goal.

42
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,937
You must be pretty committed.
Going to Paris on an install?

43
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,230
Yeah-- Uh-- Uh--

44
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,898
Um, you know, about-- About that--

45
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:32,234
The whole Paris thing...
Can we keep that between us?

46
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:34,528
I don't want everyone else
getting jealous.

47
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,071
Yogurt time.

48
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,948
Oh, is it--? Is it yogurt time already?

49
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,284
Uh, yogurt, the most important meal
of the day.

50
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:44,371
I will give you the full Chuck Bartowski
tutorial when I get back. I promise.

51
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,418
I'm gonna totally hit that.

52
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,920
May the best stalker win.

53
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,255
Oops.

54
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:58,969
Hey. Where's Shaw?

55
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,846
Off grid on a covert mission.

56
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:04,933
It's not your concern
where Agent Shaw is, Mr. Bartowski.

57
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,728
Oh, uh, that's actually
Agent Bartowski now.

58
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:11,023
Don't know if you heard, but I completed
my first solo mish last week.

59
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,108
Paris, international op.

60
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,486
But you probably have been briefed.

61
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:19,364
We've traced a large sum of money
from a Ring account...

62
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,908
...into a civilian account.

63
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:23,911
I want to know why.
What's the money for?

64
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,956
The civilian's name is Manoosh Depak.
Trained as a computer engineer.

65
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,709
Dropped out of MIT
after his freshman year.

66
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,212
Classic geek tragedy. Sound familiar?

67
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:36,673
We sent a virus that destroyed
the CPU of his custom computer...

68
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:40,052
...and bought up every Series Eight CPU
within 30 miles.

69
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,804
He'll come into the Buy More
to replace it.

70
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:45,682
Develop him as an asset,
Agent Bartowski.

71
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,268
Find out what he's doing for the Ring.

72
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:51,730
That's it? That's the whole mission?

73
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,190
Have it done by lunch.

74
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:56,652
Don't get cocky, Bartowski.
One "mish" does not an agent make.

75
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,528
Chuck, you can't take this lightly.

76
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:00,781
Developing an asset
is very tricky business.

77
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:05,202
You need to insinuate yourself into their
life, have them trust you completely...

78
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,622
...knowing that one day you're
probably gonna have to burn them.

79
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,541
The trick is to find the hole in their life.
Fill it.

80
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:15,671
This Manoosh loser,
he's a loner. Friendless.

81
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:19,925
And the asset has entered the store.
Showtime, Bartowski.

82
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:23,470
Don't worry, guys. Piece of cake.

83
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:26,765
"Mish."

84
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,645
Chuck's not ready for an asset.

85
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,314
We're advancing him too quickly.
I'm worried.

86
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:37,401
Our job's not to worry. It's to train.
Three o'clock.

87
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:39,444
He's with the newest Buy Moron.

88
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,156
Can I help you, sir?

89
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,200
- Chuck, I got it.
- No, let me help.

90
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,368
She's still in training.

91
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,078
I'd rather have her help me.

92
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:50,747
No, Chuck, I'm ready.
I can handle a simple sale.

93
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,000
Hannah, no sales are simple.

94
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:57,754
But don't worry, you will get your chance
to shine as soon as you're ready.

95
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,381
Okay.

96
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:02,884
Ah, sorry about that.

97
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,720
Alone at last.

98
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:07,306
- What can I do you for?
- Nothing.

99
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:10,017
Now that you ruined my flow
with that hottie.

100
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:11,685
Let me ring you up.

101
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:15,480
Uh, are you from around here?
Is that a Burbankian accent I detect?

102
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:16,732
Woodland Hills.

103
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:20,277
See? I knew I heard the familiar twang
of the San Fernando Valley.

104
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,404
Your eyes are hypnotic.
Chestnut? Hazel?

105
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:25,741
Get a room, Bartowski.
You're not asking him out on a date.

106
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:29,286
- I'll get the CPU somewhere else.
- Wait, wait, wait. No, no. Uh...

107
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,789
- You should just take it.
- What do you mean?

108
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,709
It's on the house.
For the inconvenience with the hottie.

109
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,669
You sure? I mean, isn't that illegal?

110
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:38,920
It's on me.

111
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,839
Ease up. You're coming on strong.

112
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:45,052
Here's my card, if you have computer
problems, or if you wanna chat.

113
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,304
You know, rap a little.

114
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,930
Thanks.

115
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,184
- Idiot.
- I'm not trying to pressure you.

116
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,686
No biggie. You have my card.
If you call, you call.

117
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:59,274
It's okay. I'll hold them off. Call me.

118
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,401
I stand corrected. He's not ready.

119
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,862
Thank you.

120
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,198
--Tablespoon of chopped
basil. It's a good idea to add basil--

121
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,243
- Aah!
- Oh, are you okay?

122
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,452
Yeah.

123
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,331
Yeah, just caught up
in this fascinating article...

124
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,499
...on kidney failure.

125
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,126
You've been jittery lately.

126
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:03,088
Ever since the generalissimo's party
you've haven't been acting like yourself.

127
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:07,634
Well, I just haven't been sleeping lately.
Nothing to worry about.

128
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:10,095
You don't rock-climb anymore.
You never work out.

129
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,347
You just lay around
and watch TV all day.

130
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,141
It's like I'm married to Morgan.

131
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,393
I pulled a hammy, I'll have you know.

132
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:19,146
I'll be back on the bike in no time.

133
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:20,856
Can I ask you a question about Chuck?

134
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:25,694
- Oh.
- Yeah, but he's your brother.

135
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,363
I can't imagine
I can tell you anything about him.

136
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,615
Did you know
he went to Paris last week?

137
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:34,286
I found this claim ticket for
Charles de Gaulle Airport on his luggage.

138
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,873
Yeah. Yeah, uh, he mentioned it.

139
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,875
Mentioned it? Why wouldn't he--?

140
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:43,170
Why wouldn't he say anything?
He's always wanted to go to Paris.

141
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:45,630
- Did he see the Eiffel Tower?
- Yeah, he did.

142
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,049
No, he didn't. I don't know.

143
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,760
Damn it. I am late for my rounds.
Gotta run.

144
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,471
No, Devon. Wait a minute.

145
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,556
You're not telling me something.
What's going on?

146
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:57,684
Going on? What, like a conspiracy?

147
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,687
- You're freaking.
- You are hiding something. What is it?

148
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,565
That I love you? Which I'm not hiding.

149
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:07,319
Let's talk about this later.
There are kidneys failing as we speak.

150
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,071
Devon. De--

151
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:18,163
What are you doing Friday?
You wanna hang in my van?

152
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,332
What about Thursday?
And I'm disease-free.

153
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,501
I don't think Mr. Barnes
can say the same.

154
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,252
- That was low.
- All's fair, kiddo.

155
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,880
Yeah, I think that I'm pretty booked up
this week.

156
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,591
- Hannah, can I see you for a second?
- Oh, yeah.

157
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,053
Remember what I said. Me, safe.
Everyone else, very, very dangerous.

158
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,597
How'd you like to start phase one
of the tutorial?

159
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,349
I thought you'd never ask.

160
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,726
- Yogurt time.
- Most important meal of the day.

161
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,937
- Uh, we'll talk later.
- What about the tutorial?

162
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:44,439
Lesson number one: never work hungry.

163
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,234
Very dangerous, huh?

164
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,361
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah.

165
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,447
Mind keeping an eye on Hannah?
The vultures are circling.

166
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:53,949
Oh, boy.

167
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:56,535
- Lester, Jeff.
- What now?

168
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,120
Can I see you both in my office, please?

169
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:00,956
You have an office?

170
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,837
What happened
to all the brooms and bleach?

171
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:11,049
I just, uh, move them in and out
every morning.

172
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,802
- Gentlemen, have a seat, please.
- Okay.

173
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:19,599
Okay.

174
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:23,603
It is my duty to tell you
there will be no dating in the workplace.

175
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:27,983
- Eh? You dated Anna.
- It's my constitutional right to fornicate.

176
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,776
Okay.

177
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:32,320
Whew. Here's the thing.

178
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,322
I like her, okay?

179
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,325
I'm just asking you guys to,
you know, lay off.

180
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:41,121
Fine, but I get to sleep over
with you and Chuck twice a week.

181
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:44,082
Okay. You?

182
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:48,169
Next hire, I want you to find me a wife.

183
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:49,671
A woman of color.

184
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,131
Preferably Padma Lakshmi.

185
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,008
Done.

186
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,011
One condition.
You men are excellent stalkers.

187
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:59,014
Find out everything there is to know
about Hannah, okay?

188
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,851
Likes, dislikes. Everything.

189
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,477
Consider her stalked.

190
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:10,191
Okay. Credit card charges,
mostly video games, comic books.

191
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:13,653
Phone records, only one female caller
in the last year, his sister.

192
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:17,282
I feel so sorry for this guy.
He seems so lonely.

193
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:21,411
Oh, whoops. That's your old file,
Bartowski. Sorry about that.

194
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,997
Ah, here we go. Oddly similar.

195
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:27,792
"Battlestar Galactica, Dune,
nacho sampler."

196
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,711
Sounds like your dream date.

197
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,047
The problem was that
you came on too strong.

198
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:34,049
Never seem like you're making advances.

199
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:37,427
You want the other person
to feel like they're in control. Here.

200
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,554
Thank you.

201
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:43,308
So, uh, that first day you came
into the Buy More, when we first met...

202
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,934
...what did they tell you?

203
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:48,146
You hadn't had a date in a year.
They don't waste the blonds on anyone.

204
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,024
Uh, it hadn't been a year, okay? Thanks.

205
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,735
They thought you and I could connect.

206
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,864
I remember you left me your card
so I could call you so we could go out.

207
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,159
I felt like I was having
the luckiest day of my life.

208
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:05,080
- God, I was pathetic.
- No, you were sweet and innocent.

209
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:07,082
I liked you.

210
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,668
It made it much harder.

211
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,921
- Why?
- Hey, sap's on his way to the bar.

212
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,756
Let's go.

213
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,892
The Last Man.

214
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,894
Incredible book.

215
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:32,273
Greatest literary achievement
of our generation.

216
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:36,403
Hey, you're that guy from the store today.

217
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,030
Oh, yeah.

218
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,282
We had a bet going to see if we could...

219
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,951
...get a customer to steal something.

220
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,870
- I won.
- I knew it.

221
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:49,249
Something had to be going on
for that chick to wanna wait on me.

222
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,459
You don't need a 160 IQ
to figure that out.

223
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:52,794
Boost his ego, Chuck.

224
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,257
She, uh, probably liked you.

225
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,217
No way.

226
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,510
The usual.

227
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,805
We're all out
of the nacho sampler tonight, Manoosh.

228
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,557
Last one is right there.

229
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,726
We stole all the guac from the kitchen.

230
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:11,271
Remember, the nacho sampler
is his favorite dish.

231
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:18,236
Go ahead. Help yourself.

232
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,155
Thanks, um...

233
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:21,823
Chuck.

234
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,159
Can I buy you a beer, Chuck?

235
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,996
Here we go.
What did you find out about Hannah?

236
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:31,416
Um, she is out of your league.

237
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,169
She's a sophisticated,
classy kind of broad.

238
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:37,005
Yeah, she eats sushi with chopsticks.

239
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,339
And without the rice.

240
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,009
- Wow.
- I copied her iTunes and iPhone play lists.

241
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:44,512
- She listens to classical music.
- Oh, boy.

242
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,349
Tchaikovsky's "Swan Lake" is her most
played. And she likes French cinema.

243
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,269
And foreign films.

244
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,937
Sorry, my friend.

245
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:56,483
Even with us spying on her,
you do not stand a chance.

246
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,236
Good job, Chuck. Keep it personal.

247
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:03,364
Anyway, so my dad was a physicist, right?
But he cracked.

248
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:06,534
So when I saw myself going down
that same road, I quit...

249
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,119
...dropped out of Stanford.

250
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,706
That's exactly what happened to me,
except I dropped out of MIT.

251
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,835
I could tell a fellow underachieving,
underappreciated man of intellect.

252
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:20,048
Great, two geeks in a pod.

253
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:23,551
Are you suggesting that Buy More is
not an impressive enough career choice?

254
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,639
It's okay. All the doubters
will be sorry soon enough.

255
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,225
They don't understand guys like us.

256
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:34,729
- I got something big planned.
- This is it. Move in.

257
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,523
Gently, Chuck. Don't push him.

258
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:39,234
Uh, how--? How so? What are you, uh--?
What are you working on?

259
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:43,613
Work. Won't leave me alone.

260
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,032
Hello?

261
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,117
Guys, he's got a Ring phone.

262
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,744
I'll run a trace.

263
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,746
Whoa, slow down, chief.

264
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,414
Yes, I have the prototype.

265
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,084
Still have some kinks to work out.

266
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:59,420
Look, I gotta go. I'm with a friend.

267
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:03,550
Sorry about that.
These guys, they're a little high-strung.

268
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,428
Act all tough. Think they're intimidating
with their secret phones.

269
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,389
Ooh, scary.

270
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,894
Signal bounced back three miles.
Ring's tracking him.

271
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:17,021
We got five minutes before they get here.

272
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,773
Time to send in a pro. You're up.

273
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,276
So you were talking about your job?

274
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,736
I'm doing something weapons-related.

275
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,239
But that's really all I can say.

276
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,784
I wanna tell you. Believe me, I do.

277
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,632
What the hell is she doing in here?
I got this.

278
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,135
You weren't moving fast enough.
Had to send a closer.

279
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,262
The Ring will be here any minute.

280
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,472
That hot chick just smiled at me.

281
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,099
Oh, my God, what do I do?

282
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,226
Just play it cool. Let her come to you.

283
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,145
- Is this what cool people do?
- Yeah.

284
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,480
Just, you know, kind of put out the vibe.

285
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,983
Make a move, Walker. We're wasting time.

286
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:05,445
Excuse me. Is this seat taken?

287
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:07,322
Help him out, Chuck.

288
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:09,449
- Uh...
- No, it's not. It's not taken.

289
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,826
He was actually saving it for you,
I believe.

290
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,828
- What is happening?
- Thank you.

291
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,831
- Sarah.
- Manoosh.

292
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,462
The Ring's here. Get him out back, now.

293
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,006
Manoosh, come here.

294
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,800
- Where?
- Closer.

295
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:33,473
You got something on your lip.
Let me take it off.

296
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,318
Get him. I'll get the briefcase.

297
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:48,154
- They're heading in.
- I want him alive.

298
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,198
Looks like our friend had one too many.

299
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,950
Bye.

300
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,543
Wow.

301
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,545
This is the best night of my life.

302
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:08,216
Nice job, Walker.
Another geek bites the dust.

303
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,738
Wake up, baby.

304
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,824
Hi.

305
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,744
- Where am I?
- My bedroom.

306
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,246
What? You don't remember?

307
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:41,874
Guess you had one too many drinks,
lover boy.

308
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,960
Did we--? You know?

309
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,920
Yes, and it was amazing.

310
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:50,591
Oh, it was so intense,
we both just passed out.

311
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:54,262
I've never even spoken to a woman
as beautiful as you before.

312
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,596
Why'd you choose me?

313
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:58,933
Because there is something
just so mysterious about you and sexy.

314
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,561
And you were telling me
about your top-secret work.

315
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:05,064
And secrets turn me on.

316
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:08,401
It's a weapon. New technology
that will change everything.

317
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:09,944
- Tell me more.
- Okay.

318
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:14,073
But, first, I don't really remember
much from last night.

319
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:16,909
Can we do it again so I'll never forget?

320
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:36,012
Guys, this isn't working.

321
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:39,307
Is he gonna be okay?
That's, like, the fifth tranq dart.

322
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,184
How many can a normal person handle?

323
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,352
As many as it takes him
to say what he's building.

324
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,189
They're twilight tranqs.
They don't do permanent damage.

325
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,525
They just make you forget
what happened in the last five minutes.

326
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:52,612
Well, he's my asset.
I should have handled this.

327
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,202
He's ready for round six.

328
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,163
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Take it easy, Tranqenstein.

329
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,008
- Hello.
- Chuck, it's Manoosh.

330
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,551
Hey, Manizzle.

331
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,386
How you doing? How was last night?

332
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:21,015
I can't really remember, but the fact
that I'm half-naked right now...

333
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,851
...I gotta say,
you are the best wingman in the world.

334
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,854
Well, thanks. What can I say?
I do have my skill sets.

335
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:30,483
Um, you didn't happen to come across
a briefcase at the Mexican restaurant?

336
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,318
My entire life's work's in there.

337
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,070
- I'm kind of freaking out.
- No.

338
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,864
Your wingman saw
that you left said briefcase...

339
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,366
...and picked it up for you.

340
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:41,702
Oh, thank you, Chuck.
Look, I've got a flight to catch.

341
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,704
Meet me at the Buy More, half an hour?

342
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,039
Half hour? Not a problem.

343
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,999
Great. Thanks.

344
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,503
Sarah, you in there?

345
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,426
Oh.

346
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:03,975
No, Langley said don't open it.
They're sending their own HAZMAT team.

347
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:07,061
We don't have time to wait.
Get your hand off of there.

348
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,147
Hmm.

349
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:12,775
Comic book, glasses, shirt.

350
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,069
Bingo.

351
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:23,578
Guys, I'm not flashing.
Whatever it is, it's not in the Intersect.

352
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:24,954
Oh.

353
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,957
Easy, Bartowski.
We don't know what this is.

354
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,584
You think it could be a bomb?

355
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:32,795
I don't know,
but we're not gonna find out the hard way.

356
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,256
Okay, just meet Manoosh
at the Buy More.

357
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:38,426
And give him back the briefcase.
And act like nothing happened.

358
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,761
Wait-- Don't we need to replace it
before we do that?

359
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:44,473
Imagine what the Ring is gonna do
if they find out he doesn't have it.

360
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,726
Just don't think about it, Chuck.

361
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:49,645
It makes being a spy a lot easier.

362
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:59,155
Dude.

363
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:02,575
- Dude, I am freaking out.
- Come here. Come here.

364
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:05,453
Ellie found a baggage ticket
from your Paris mission.

365
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,456
I didn't know what to say.
I told her you were going on a work trip.

366
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:11,459
I can't do this anymore.
I have to tell her the truth.

367
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,669
Look, you need to calm down, okay?

368
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,796
You cannot tell her anything.

369
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:18,799
I don't think you realize
the gravity of the situation.

370
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:21,135
But you know my secret.

371
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,804
- There are strings attached to that.
- What strings?

372
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:27,808
Your lives are never gonna be the same.
They'll stick you into witness protection.

373
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:30,478
I don't think that you want that.

374
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:33,648
I understand that the lying
is very difficult right now...

375
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:36,984
...but, trust me, it gets easier.

376
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:40,613
Oh, jeez. Get down, get down.

377
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,786
- Hey, hey, Ellie.
- Hi. Um...

378
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:47,995
What's going on?

379
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:50,039
Chuck, look, I know that we're older...

380
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:53,459
...and we don't
have to tell each other everything...

381
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,503
...but I found out about Paris.

382
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,797
And I just-- I don't know.

383
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,841
When did we start keeping secrets
from each other?

384
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:04,303
Well, the thing is, I was gonna tell you.
Um, it was a business trip.

385
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,055
This very eccentric customer...

386
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:10,518
...insisted that I do a home-theater install
in his flat in Paris.

387
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,019
So why keep that from me?

388
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,146
Well, because I did such a good job...

389
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:17,692
...that he said I could use his flat
for free for a week.

390
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:20,027
And I figured, maybe you and Devon...

391
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:23,823
...could use a proper honeymoon.
And I wanted it to be a surprise.

392
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,700
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

393
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,868
Chuck, that is the sweetest thing.

394
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:30,371
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I thought...

395
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,206
...you were keeping secrets.

396
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:33,708
Told you he's ready.

397
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,711
Kid's a good liar.
You taught him well, Walker.

398
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,629
Please, Ellie.

399
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,507
Brother, sister.
There are no secrets between us.

400
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,342
Bye.

401
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,223
That was so cold-blooded.
How could you just lie to her like that?

402
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,892
Ellie and I aren't kids anymore, all right?

403
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:56,439
There are some things
she's better off not knowing.

404
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,901
Manizzle.

405
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,446
Thanks, Chuck. You are a lifesaver.

406
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,364
Hey, what are friends for, right?

407
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:08,659
- We are friends, aren't we?
- Yeah.

408
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,870
When I get back, I'm going to be rich.

409
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:14,040
I'll start a company of my own.
And then we can work together.

410
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:15,458
Don't worry, I won't forget you.

411
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:22,423
Hello? No, I told you
I'm still working the kinks out.

412
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:26,052
Yeah. Calm down.
You'll give yourself a heart attack.

413
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,805
- Who was that?
- The putzes who hired me.

414
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:32,600
They're paying me peanuts
compared to the open market.

415
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:34,268
But I'm no fool.

416
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:37,271
Anyway, thanks, buddy.

417
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:40,649
Yeah. Wait, wait, wait. Um, uh...

418
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:43,444
Before you go,
let me get you some yogurt.

419
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:46,280
Because, you know,
you can't travel on an empty stomach.

420
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:49,241
- Stay here. I'll be right back.
- Okay, all right.

421
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,455
Not picking up any sign of ordnance.
Definitely not a bomb.

422
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:58,000
Guys. Guys, we need
to help Manoosh, okay?

423
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,796
The Ring is gonna track him.
They're gonna hurt him, or worse.

424
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:04,507
Cry me a river. He's building a weapon.

425
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:06,634
He's no innocent.

426
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,970
He served his purpose.

427
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:13,724
That's what an asset is,
conduit to information, nothing more.

428
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,817
No more ducking us, Manoosh.
Take us to your lab.

429
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:24,527
We want our weapon.

430
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,529
Wait, wait, wait. Ah--

431
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,489
Found something.

432
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,450
Aah!

433
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:33,661
- What is that?
- Anthrax?

434
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,246
Agent Orange?

435
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:37,123
Okay, guys. Fine.

436
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:40,000
Just, uh, let me put my shades on
real quick.

437
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:41,460
It's really bright out.

438
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:44,547
UV protection.
Very important these days.

439
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,387
Shaving cream. It was a decoy.

440
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:52,888
Then where's the weapon?

441
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:54,557
They found Manoosh.

442
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:57,852
He doesn't know who he's dealing with.
They're gonna kill him.

443
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:43,230
That's not the weapon.

444
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,233
Manoosh is the weapon.

445
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:50,404
He built a new Intersect?

446
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:04,877
How did Manoosh build an Intersect?

447
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,880
I thought my dad was the only one
who knew how to do that.

448
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,882
After 2.0 Intersect was destroyed...

449
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:13,677
...the Ring lifted certain burnt
components from a CIA warehouse.

450
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,471
Manoosh reverse-engineered it.

451
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,264
We need to find Manoosh.

452
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:20,142
He mentioned getting rich,
selling to the highest bidder.

453
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,727
I got something.

454
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:25,940
Manoosh just used his credit card
to book a flight to Dubai.

455
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:27,274
Why? What's in Dubai?

456
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:31,278
Weap-Con. The greatest weapons
convention in the world.

457
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,448
I go every year.
I find it incredibly relaxing.

458
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:41,247
Looks like I'll get to write this year's
off as a business trip.

459
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,047
Come in.

460
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,590
Hey, Morgan.

461
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:53,342
Jeff said you wanted to see me.

462
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:54,885
I did, yeah. Nothing urgent.

463
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,763
I just wanted to see
how the Buy More was treating you.

464
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,350
"Swan Lake." That's my favorite.

465
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,977
Mine too.

466
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:04,478
Sans Respirer is a classic.

467
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,772
I must've seen it like 10 times.

468
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:10,276
Twelve. Yeah, I can't get enough
of French New Wave.

469
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:12,486
- Huh.
- Oh, have a seat. Have a seat.

470
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:15,072
Yeah, it's amazing
how much we have in common.

471
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:17,199
Right? Yeah, I just--

472
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,326
I love international cinema.

473
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:22,913
But it's not just the cinema,
it's the people, and the culture, right?

474
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:26,542
Sadly, my colleagues think
that Burbank is the center of the world.

475
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:30,045
Yeah, Chuck had never been to Paris
until last week on that install.

476
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:33,007
Chuck went to Paris?

477
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,677
Oh, uh, right. I forgot.

478
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:40,347
Chuck told me to keep it quiet.
Everything's a little secret around here.

479
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:43,434
But, of course, you know,
as you are assistant manager...

480
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,102
Right, I am. Of course.

481
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,021
Sure. I know everything about Chuck.

482
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:51,358
Well, do you mind telling me
what goes on over at that yogurt store?

483
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:56,030
Because, um... Uh, he is--

484
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:59,867
Okay. --constantly running over there.

485
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,745
The yogurt store?
Yes, uh, his ex works there.

486
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:05,706
He's having trouble letting go, so...

487
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:10,628
Um, Morgan. Hey, what was it
that you wanted to talk to me about?

488
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,546
Nothing.

489
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,470
Paris?

490
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:21,889
Where else has he gone?

491
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,855
Welcome to Weap-Con.

492
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,450
Ammo can be found
in the west pavilion.

493
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:45,454
Explosives and short-range missiles
are in the mezzanine.

494
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:49,875
The peacemaker demonstration
has been postponed.

495
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,627
Hello.

496
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,087
Laser pen. Poison pen.

497
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:54,546
Casey, no shopping.

498
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:56,799
We're here to find Manoosh. Come on.

499
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:59,051
- What kind of pen you want?
- The laser pen.

500
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:03,097
Behold this beauty.
The EM-50 Mobile Interrogation Unit.

501
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:05,099
The most exclusive one of its kind...

502
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:08,602
...the EM-50 is nearly impossible
to escape from.

503
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:12,106
You don't have time, but you need
to extract vital information?

504
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:14,108
This is your unit.

505
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,777
Presentation on stage four...

506
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,779
...is about to begin.

507
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,739
Please, have a seat. Get situated.

508
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:21,990
Huh?

509
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:25,452
Ladies, gentlemen, warlords, sheiks
and Huns.

510
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,913
I see some Huns back there, don't I?

511
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:30,290
Welcome to the future
of warfare and weapons.

512
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,167
I have before me...

513
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,837
...the most powerful weapon
known to mankind.

514
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:41,176
That weapon, you ask, is me.

515
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,931
At this time yesterday,
I was a pathetic weakling.

516
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,225
These bikini babes
wouldn't even spit on me.

517
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:53,063
I have no muscle, terrible allergies
and am completely uncoordinated.

518
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:57,025
But behold me now.

519
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:05,909
Moments ago
I was a 100-pound weakling.

520
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:10,497
Now, a deadly kung fu expert.

521
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:14,835
Laugh if you will.
Do I have any volunteers?

522
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:17,212
Maybe one of you thinks
they can kick my ass.

523
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:21,925
Step back, ladies.

524
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:34,563
Ooh.

525
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:41,987
Backstage.

526
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,072
Thank you. Thank you.

527
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:47,785
Imagine an entire army of men like me.
No training involved.

528
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:52,456
Just throw these glasses on any civilian
and, voilà, an army of instant warriors.

529
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:55,834
So call your banks, your kings,
your dignitaries or what have you.

530
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:57,878
We'll start bidding in five minutes.

531
00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:00,798
And we're gonna kick this bad boy off
at 50 million.

532
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,549
Thank you.

533
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,356
Nachos, just as I requested.

534
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,735
He's my asset. I'll handle this.

535
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,654
Don't get soft on him, Bartowski.

536
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:27,324
The only way any of us are safe
is if he's under lock and key.

537
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,785
Well, fine. I can control him.

538
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,245
Then do it.

539
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,254
Chuck? What are you doing here?

540
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:45,425
I came to protect you, okay?

541
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:47,678
To stop you from making
a horrible mistake.

542
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:49,388
I know about the glasses.

543
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:52,099
I know about the new Intersect
that you're building.

544
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,017
Who are you?

545
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:55,894
I'm an agent with the CIA.

546
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:58,605
So you were tracking me?

547
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,941
This friendship is fake?

548
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,987
Sarah? That wasn't real either?

549
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,990
I'm sorry, okay? I really am sorry.

550
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:10,617
I'm not trying to hurt
your feelings here. I just--

551
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:12,119
I can't let you do this.

552
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:14,246
These are bad people you're selling to.

553
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:17,541
Worse than a guy
who pretends to be my only friend...

554
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:20,127
...or a woman who pretends
to have intercourse with me?

555
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:21,587
Intercourse?

556
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,882
Truth is, I don't need friends, Chuck.

557
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,216
Not when I've got these.

558
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:29,011
Manoosh.

559
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,183
Hello, Manoosh.

560
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:40,898
We've been looking for you.
I believe you have something of ours.

561
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:54,411
Aah!

562
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:57,581
Aah, aah, aah.

563
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:08,258
Wow, so now, not only does the Ring
have both Manoosh...

564
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:10,218
...but also the new Intersect.

565
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:11,845
That is just super.

566
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,348
Good thing I bought that laser pen.

567
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:16,475
It burns through anything.

568
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:19,478
I thought Sarah specifically said
no shopping.

569
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:22,856
Just scooch over here,
grab it with your mouth, come on.

570
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:26,526
Get here and pull it out
of my inside pocket. Let's go.

571
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:29,363
Come on. Here we go.

572
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:32,366
Shh. Quiet.

573
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:35,327
- You'll break it. On the left.
- Okay.

574
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:36,870
Easy. Okay, okay, okay.

575
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:39,665
- Come on.
- Shh.

576
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:42,960
- What if I--?
- Just get in there.

577
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,672
Yeah, that's it. That's it. Ow.

578
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:49,299
- Okay. Ow, ow. Easy.
- I gotta get to the pen.

579
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:51,677
- Don't bite me.
- I'm not biting you.

580
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:54,471
- You got it? Just be careful of the button.
- Uh-huh.

581
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,056
- It activates the laser.
- Mm-hm.

582
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:57,557
Aah! Whoa!

583
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,022
You aim carefully now, Bartowski.

584
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,983
Don't you make me a eunuch.

585
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:09,569
Otherwise, I'll teach you the meaning
of eye for an eye.

586
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:12,864
Get to work.

587
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,370
Unh! I got it. Ha-ha-ha.

588
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,998
- Shh.
- Give me that.

589
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,544
- Unh!
- All right, here we go.

590
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:27,546
Here, me. Ladies first.

591
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:35,012
Viewing of AKA updated...

592
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:39,933
Look, guys, I'll cut you a deal, huh?
Half off.

593
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,852
No, you'll give it to us.

594
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:44,563
- We don't need you anymore.
- Yeah?

595
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:48,108
Looks like you need me now.

596
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:51,194
So let's talk
about a reasonable fee, okay?

597
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:53,488
Drop your guns.

598
00:33:56,451 --> 00:34:00,245
Hey, folks, sounds like another
demonstration taking place back here.

599
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:04,207
As you can see,
many of our products are ideally suited...

600
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:07,627
...for resolving
these types of hostage negotiations.

601
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:09,463
Impressive simulation.

602
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,466
Yeah, I'd rather kill him too
than let you have him.

603
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:15,969
- So I guess we're on the same page.
- Looks like Manoosh dies, then.

604
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,096
Manoosh is not going to die.

605
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:21,141
In my hand, I hold a Japanese laser pen.

606
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:22,601
Pinpoint accuracy.

607
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:26,146
Could shoot the wings off a fly,
if one was so sadistically inclined...

608
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:27,397
...which I am.

609
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:30,150
Nobody drop their guns.

610
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:33,904
He won't do it.
I can see it in his eyes. He won't kill me.

611
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:37,783
Okay, fine. I probably won't kill you.

612
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:40,786
But I will remove the greater part
of your earlobe.

613
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:44,623
What--?

614
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:45,999
Casey, what is the deal--?

615
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,960
I asked for the same pen.
She gave me the wrong pen.

616
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,630
Just like Bartowski.
Bring a knife to a gunfight.

617
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,507
Now, where were we?

618
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:57,469
Oh, I know. We were going to kill you.

619
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:15,529
He's getting away.

620
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:37,300
Secure Manoosh. He cannot walk
out of here knowing what he knows.

621
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,430
Chuck. That was awesome.

622
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,143
Incredible, just incredible.
Well, thanks for rescuing me.

623
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,853
I mean, if it weren't for you...

624
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,522
...I'd probably be
in some deep dark cell somewhere.

625
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:55,443
Uh... Speaking of which,
Manoosh, I cannot let you go.

626
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,320
Chuck, please.

627
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,030
I won't tell anybody. I promise.

628
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:02,367
No one will ever know
about the Intersect, me, the sunglasses.

629
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:04,077
I'll disappear. I swear.

630
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,085
Thanks, Chuck.

631
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:14,087
I owe you my life.

632
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:23,638
Here at the tranq-gun booth...

633
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:26,391
...we feature
the latest in non-lethal suppression.

634
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,226
That's 50 cc's of pure-grade ether.

635
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:32,606
Your enemies will get plenty of rest
before you interrogate them.

636
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,860
I guess Bartowski
doesn't have the stones.

637
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:47,537
Another fabulous demonstration.

638
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,122
I stand corrected.

639
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,801
He has to go underground.

640
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:04,804
If the Ring finds him,
he can build them another Intersect.

641
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:06,348
It's the only way.

642
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:09,601
- Do you want me to handle it?
- Yeah.

643
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:13,939
Yeah, I would, but I have to do it.

644
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:17,734
Hey.

645
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,278
Hey, I've been scared to death.

646
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,572
So when are you guys gonna release me?

647
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:23,865
I just wanna go home.

648
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,408
Forget this ever happened.

649
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,744
You can't go home, Manoosh.

650
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,538
We are sending you
to a secured isolation facility.

651
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:34,209
- Somewhere that you will be safe.
- But I didn't do anything wrong.

652
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,878
I tried to make a few bucks,
but that's not illegal.

653
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,425
Chuck, you have to help me.

654
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,553
I thought you were my friend.

655
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,891
I'm not.

656
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:51,101
I'm a spy.

657
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,563
Chuck.

658
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,816
Chuck.

659
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,401
Please, Chuck.

660
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:03,613
Hmm. Only one way to deal
with burning an asset.

661
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,657
Johnnie Walker.

662
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:06,992
Black.

663
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:19,921
Hey, where you been?
Another trip to Paris?

664
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:23,008
- Uh, Dubai, actually.
- Funny.

665
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:26,970
Or maybe
you were at that yogurt store again?

666
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,639
I know your ex works there.

667
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,226
Uh, hey, what about that tutorial?

668
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:36,062
Rule number one:
never work on an empty stomach.

669
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:38,064
On break. Going to Kooky Sushi.

670
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,443
- Hey, there he is.
- Hey.

671
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,987
- Can we talk?
- Uh, yeah, I'm kind of beat, Morgan.

672
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:47,490
Oh, yeah, I can imagine. All that travel.

673
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,576
What--? Uh, what traveling?

674
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:52,579
Just driving around town
on all those installs.

675
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:55,290
- Right. Yeah.
- That's gotta be exhausting.

676
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,877
Hey. Anything you want
to talk to me about?

677
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:04,257
No. Is there anything
you wanna ask me?

678
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,176
No.

679
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:09,137
- Okay, great. Good talk.
- Absolutely. One of our best.

680
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:12,974
Yo.

681
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:15,769
How'd it go last night, stallion?

682
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:17,937
You take her to Pound Town?

683
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:20,607
Can I get an address on that?

684
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,568
Actually, I need
a little more research done here, fellas.

685
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:27,781
I told you, we still need to study
her sleeping patterns.

686
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:30,784
Oh, no, not research on Hannah.

687
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:32,786
Research on Chuck.

688
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,792
Finally.

689
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:42,754
Honey, the tickets that Chuck got us
to Paris are here.

690
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:45,048
First class.

691
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,551
I don't think we should go.

692
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,720
What? They're free tickets.

693
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,263
No, they're not.

694
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:54,516
Nothing is free.

695
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:58,603
- Those have strings attached.
- What strings? They're from Chuck.

696
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,064
- What are you talking about?
- He--

697
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,402
You--

698
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:09,864
You have to obey me.
Yeah, I think that was in our vows.

699
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,617
I am the husband,
and I forbid us to go to Paris.

700
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:15,120
That's it.

701
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,916
- Oh, hey, Morgan.
- Hey.

702
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,335
You forbid us?
Are you kidding me, Devon?

703
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:23,920
Ellie, is everything okay?

704
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:27,257
No, I think there's something weird
going on with Chuck and Devon.

705
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:31,136
It's like they're-- I don't know.
They're keeping this secret from me.

706
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:34,848
Um, okay.

707
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:39,018
Are you suggesting Chuck is caught
in a big giant web of conspiracy...

708
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:40,186
...and deception?

709
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,565
I know. I know, it sounds ridiculous.

710
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:47,735
Because I couldn't agree more.
I've been thinking about this for months.

711
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,988
Finally, someone
with some common sense.

712
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:52,866
We have to figure out what's going on.

713
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,910
Don't worry about it.
I got my best men on it.

714
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:34,657
Our boy's growing up, huh?

715
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,659
When we first met him...

716
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:39,537
...you ever think
he'd be able to burn a asset?

717
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:41,414
No.

718
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:44,000
Yeah, he's turning into a spy.

719
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,085
That's a good thing.

720
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,507
Is it?

721
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:56,721
So you think this kid's got the Intersect?

722
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:59,516
Right, Agent Walker.
He's connected to Bryce Larkin.

723
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:02,018
- Weaknesses?
- Bright, but an underachiever.

724
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:05,188
Lonely. Had his heart broken recently.

725
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,941
I'm downloading his picture now.

726
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:17,700
Piece of cake.

727
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,911
Who is that? Vicki Vale.

728
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,248
Vicki Vale, Vick, Vicki Vale
