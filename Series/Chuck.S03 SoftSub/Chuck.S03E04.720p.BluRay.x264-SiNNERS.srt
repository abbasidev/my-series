1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:04,086
Hi. Here's a few things
you need to know.

2
00:00:04,295 --> 00:00:05,504
Kind of crazy night.

3
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,506
One more patient
and I am on my way.

4
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:10,050
So, what seems to be the problem?

5
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:17,099
Well, let's have a look at you.

6
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:20,936
Where am I?

7
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:24,815
- Who are you?
- My name is Sydney.

8
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,617
And here is where you are.

9
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,623
Now, I trust you're feeling all right.

10
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,417
Not too many bumps and bruises?

11
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:46,545
After all, we're going to need you
in tiptop shape.

12
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,255
Need me for what?

13
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:49,715
Nothing too difficult.

14
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,259
At least not for one of the CIA's best.

15
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,386
You've got me mixed up
with someone else.

16
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:55,596
I'm just a doctor.

17
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:57,890
We know exactly who you are, Devon.

18
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:03,312
So please tell me.

19
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,070
What is it like
being a world-class spy?

20
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:13,155
Chuck, stop freaking out.

21
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:17,117
I'm not freaking out. I'll tell you why.
That would require me overreacting.

22
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:20,954
Don't think it's possible to overreact
to my brother-in-law being kidnapped!

23
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:23,499
We're doing the best we can, Chuck.
Go to work.

24
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:26,168
We'll call you
as soon as we have any news.

25
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:30,672
Look at that. Ellie is making her
50th call to Awesome within the hour.

26
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:34,176
In addition to the 20 she's made to me
already today. She's losing it.

27
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:36,095
What am I supposed to tell her?

28
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:39,765
Honestly, Chuck, the best thing
you can do is to just calm down.

29
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,850
If you really want someone
to calm down...

30
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:45,145
...never tell him to calm down.
Because it doesn't work.

31
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:48,107
I'm sorry. You're right.
I'm sorry. I'm calming down.

32
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:54,154
Here comes the calm.
I will soon be calm.

33
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:58,659
Not working. I'm not calming down.
I got an idea. I'm gonna go to work...

34
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:04,123
...then you call me the absolute second
that you hear anything about Devon.

35
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,504
Calm down, Morgan.
You got nothing to worry about, son.

36
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:14,508
You can wipe that concerned look
off that hairy face.

37
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:19,054
It's a little unusual that you'd call me in
before I even have time to screw up.

38
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,890
You're right.
Usually mornings are Big-Mike time.

39
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:24,143
A time for reflection and then pastry.

40
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,563
But I'll tell you something, son.
You've become like family to me.

41
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,523
- Ah. Thank you, sir.
- No.

42
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:33,902
Thank your mama.
Woman makes me feel good.

43
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,697
Real good. Like a man should.

44
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,659
But credit where it's due.
I've noticed a change in you.

45
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:43,328
Commanding more respect
from your co-workers...

46
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,247
...you're walking a little taller.

47
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:48,750
It seems to me you're ready to run
with the big dogs.

48
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,003
Of course. Wait. What?

49
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,839
Morgan, are you ready
to be my assistant manager?

50
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,550
- Me, sir?
- I believe in you, son.

51
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:01,263
Well?

52
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,348
Yes.

53
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:10,439
Yeah. This should be good.
One of the big dogs.

54
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,026
No. Don't do that.

55
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:17,279
That's a little dog.
Schnauzer or something. Big dog.

56
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,781
Sarah, it's Chuck.
I have an idea: Delta Force.

57
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,284
Called them yet?
Call me back with their number.

58
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:24,536
Just in time.
Need that big brain of yours.

59
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,873
- Jeff is wrong about something.
- That's his default setting.

60
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,416
- Frankly--
Excuse me, sir.

61
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:32,961
Can you help me? I understand
you're having a big sale on HDTVs.

62
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:36,006
Yes, we are.
Lester or Jeff here could actually--

63
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,093
- Sarah.
- Hey.

64
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:43,972
- Seriously. It's an emergency here.
- Young man? You listening?

65
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,663
Excuse me. I'm so sorry.
That's not what I meant to say.

66
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:13,961
Impressive. If Van Damme and Seagal
got into a fight, who would win?

67
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:15,837
- Your big question?
- Bear in mind...

68
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:18,465
...that Master Seagal's fighting style
is aikido.

69
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:22,552
Like so, "I'm just a cook.
I'm a lowly cook. Come on."

70
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,181
Come on, man.
This is gonna hurt you.

71
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,016
What you got? What you got?

72
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,021
Boom-boom-pow!

73
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,857
He'll live.
We need to get you out of here.

74
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,651
We think we know
who has Awesome.

75
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,654
Last patient he saw at the hospital
was a Ring operative.

76
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,114
What? What? Sarah.

77
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:46,368
The Ring? Oh, my God.
This is all my fault. I got him involved.

78
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:49,538
- Probably torturing him as we speak.
- No reason to think that.

79
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,666
Yeah. Hundreds of other
nightmare scenarios far worse.

80
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:53,875
- Chuck.
- No.

81
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,712
I'm responsible for this.
I killed Captain Awesome--

82
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,338
Oh, my God.

83
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:02,301
You're back. Thank God.
Oh, my God, you're back. You're back.

84
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,885
This is great news.

85
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,805
Very good news.
Are you okay? Tell me you're okay.

86
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:09,182
Chuck, they think I'm a spy.

87
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:13,687
I'm in trouble here, man.
They think I'm you.

88
00:05:57,398 --> 00:06:01,026
From what he
has told us, the woman Devon was with...

89
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,570
...is Sydney Prince,
head of a Ring cell.

90
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:07,032
She has tried to recruit several
of our agents.

91
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,701
She knows everything about me, Chuck.
Ellie too.

92
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:14,039
- Except who the real spy in the family is.
- An understandable mistake.

93
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:17,751
One of them looks like a spy
and the other one looks like Chuck.

94
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,419
- True.
- She gave me this.

95
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,713
Told me she'd contact me
with instructions.

96
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:25,217
- It's a Ring communication device.
- Works off a closed network.

97
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,887
But the NSA has recently developed
new technology to crack it.

98
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,472
Now we can put it into use.

99
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,641
Fantastic news. Sounds like a plan.

100
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,976
I'm gonna get Awesome
back to my sister.

101
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:37,312
You can't take him home
quite yet, Chuck.

102
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,606
We need to talk.
We're going to use Devon.

103
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:42,234
Excuse me, what? Oh, no.
No one is using Devon.

104
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,070
There will be no using of him
anymore.

105
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,280
No more fun spy games for him.
Forever.

106
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,324
Using Devon is our best option.

107
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:52,327
Sydney won't go to her superiors
with his identity...

108
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:55,747
...until she knows
whether she's turned him or burned him.

109
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,250
When Sydney contacts him,
he'll do what she says.

110
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,460
Long enough to track her
and bring her in.

111
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:03,338
- I have to do what she says?
- No, you don't.

112
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,799
No, he doesn't. This is my family.

113
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,176
- Come on.
- It's the only way to keep him safe.

114
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,013
Devon, we'll be with you
every step of the way.

115
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:15,350
If you tell me you can
get me through this, I trust you.

116
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,731
I will, Devon.

117
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,443
I promise.

118
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,027
Excuse me.

119
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:28,947
Stop right there.
Are you leaving early again, Bartowski?

120
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:32,200
- Are you serious?
- Of course not, man. I'm kidding.

121
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:35,245
Are you being serious?
Are you seriously wearing that vest?

122
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:40,459
Ah. Big Mike made me assistant manager.

123
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:41,668
And I accepted it.

124
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,295
Boom.

125
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,672
Congratulations. I'm proud of you.

126
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,632
Charles.

127
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,885
Oh. Oh. Wow.

128
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:52,888
Lester, I'm really sorry about the--

129
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:56,683
A completely knee-jerk reaction.
I'm just gonna switch to decaf.

130
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:59,478
It's not a problem.
In fact, I wanna thank you.

131
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:03,482
You helped me feel something
I have not felt in a long time.

132
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,150
Another foot on your body?

133
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,569
The thrill of being alive.

134
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,362
- What?
- The sensation of pain...

135
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:13,909
...coursing through my face
was like an adrenaline shot to my soul.

136
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:16,077
It made me feel like a man.

137
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,871
First time since my bar mitzvah.

138
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,540
I've never had a bar mitzvah.
Chuck, please.

139
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,584
I want you to hit me
as hard as you can.

140
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,589
I think that you two
are certifiably disturbed.

141
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:31,218
- I'm gonna go home, so...
- Hey, you want a ride home?

142
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:35,722
- Yeah, I got access to the company car.
- Oh. Big man on campus. All right.

143
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,517
Awesome is at the mall.
We gotta talk about things.

144
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,228
- So I'll see you at home. All right.
- Oh.

145
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,608
- You okay, man?
- No. No. It's Ellie.

146
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:51,238
God, Chuck, what am I gonna tell her
about where I've been? I'm a terrible liar.

147
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:56,409
- Devon, is that you?
- Remember, keep it simple. Simple.

148
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:59,788
Oh, thank God. I was so worried.

149
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:03,750
- Yeah, babe. I'm fine.
- Why didn't you call?

150
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:07,796
Uh-- After I got off the overnight...

151
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,924
...I decided I needed to clear my head.

152
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:16,388
So I went for a run in Griffith Park.

153
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,473
No cell phones there. Mm-mm.

154
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:23,270
So I'm running and I just--
I heard something in a tree.

155
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,648
It was a cat.

156
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:30,318
A hurt cat. I had to see
if it needed medical attention.

157
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,612
Then I realized...

158
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,328
...it's a bear.

159
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:42,831
- What? The cat is a bear?
- The cat's a bear.

160
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:46,835
It's a bear and it jumps out at me
and it attacks and it's like--

161
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:50,422
It's angry at me.
For some reason, this bear: Rawr!

162
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,009
- My God. You were attacked by a bear?
- Yeah. And I--

163
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,595
I cut off its head.

164
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:01,516
Yeah, babe.
I had to decapitate the bear...

165
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,811
...in self-defense in order to survive.

166
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,023
I'm glad you weren't there to see it.
It was grisly.

167
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:13,361
Do you honestly expect me
to believe this?

168
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:18,366
- Because you two think I'm an idiot.
- No. No. No, that is not what we think.

169
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,285
That's not what we think.

170
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:24,873
I think that it's time
that we tell Ellie the truth.

171
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,043
Oh, God. Thank God, Chuck.
The truth.

172
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,296
I'm terrible at this.
I'm a terrible liar, honey. You know that.

173
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,714
Clearly.

174
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:37,385
Casey was arrested early this morning
in Griffith Park. He was drunk.

175
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:40,639
Super drunk, really blotto.
Cop's words, not mine.

176
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,307
He was in bad shape. Wasn't he?

177
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,019
Yeah. Yeah, it was bad, hon.

178
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:50,565
He wet himself.
Also exposed himself.

179
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:56,237
Anyhow, Devon spent most of the day--
Pretty much all day at the station...

180
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:59,824
...talking to a buddy on the force
to get the charges dropped.

181
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,368
Oh, my God. Really?

182
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,411
- Really.
- Really.

183
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,374
Hey guys.

184
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,046
Let's go inside, Devon.

185
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,219
What?

186
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:21,971
Nothing.

187
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:23,765
Hmm.

188
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,120
Jeff, you got a second?

189
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:48,540
What's going on here, man?
I notice everybody is a little beat up.

190
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,126
- The first rule of fight--
- Easy.

191
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:54,254
Our friend Morgan here
is the assistant manager now.

192
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:57,090
Oh, guys, we've worked together
for a long time.

193
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,967
You know, we're chums.

194
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:02,470
Whatever you say, Ass Man.

195
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:05,140
Don't you mean "Mr. Ass Man"?

196
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,308
I do not.

197
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,651
I can't believe The Ring thinks
Awesome is a spy.

198
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:20,280
When do you think she's gonna call?
What do you think she's gonna say?

199
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,323
What do we do when she does call?

200
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:26,077
Chuck, the important thing is Devon
will be looking to you as his handler.

201
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:29,664
You need to remember what it felt like
to be scared, new to this.

202
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,583
Yeah. Like he'll ever forget that.

203
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,419
On this mission,
Devon is you and you're her.

204
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,504
So be her, Chuck, huh?

205
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:38,882
Well, maybe Sydney will never call.

206
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,927
Guys. Guys, it's me. Are you in there?

207
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,346
- She called.
- What's that?

208
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:48,850
I found it on my front step.
From Sydney. Gotta open it.

209
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,144
- She's gonna call in five minutes.
- Come on.

210
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,944
What do you think is in there?

211
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,077
It's okay. Answer it.

212
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,207
Hello?

213
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:16,836
From now on, I will speak to you through
the earpiece included in the package.

214
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,547
You will speak to me
through the watch we sent.

215
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:21,716
Put in the earpiece
and put on the watch.

216
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,846
Par for the course.
Just do what she says.

217
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:30,308
Okay. Putting on the earpiece now.

218
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,229
Now we can track you
on our own GPS network.

219
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:38,149
It's fine.
Standard operating procedure.

220
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:42,320
Be at the Crystal Towers downtown
in one hour. Come alone.

221
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:46,241
Oh, and, Devon,
the earpiece is also an explosive device.

222
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:49,536
Remove it or deviate
from my instructions in any way...

223
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,538
...and I will detonate it...

224
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:55,416
...ruining that lovely face of yours.

225
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,044
No.

226
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:02,382
Okay. Well, that is not standard at all.

227
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:09,764
Chuck?

228
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:13,768
- Chuck. Can you hear me?
- Yes. Yes, buddy. Yes, I'm right here.

229
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,020
You sure they can't hear me
talking to you?

230
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,857
They can hear you
if you push the button on their watch.

231
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,192
An open bug would be far too easy
to trace.

232
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,112
I labeled both watches
so you don't get confused.

233
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,616
Soon as Sydney calls,
Casey is gonna track the signal.

234
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:32,078
As soon as we've tracked her location,
we bring her in, then you're done.

235
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,789
Whew. Okay. Good.

236
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,458
- This is gonna work, right, buddy?
- Remember...

237
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:40,295
...if you freak out,
he's gonna freak out.

238
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:44,340
This is absolutely gonna work.
Everything is fine.

239
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,051
I am very confident.

240
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,512
Devon, are you ready to begin?

241
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:57,312
- Ready.
- Penthouse on the 12th floor. Go there.

242
00:14:57,479 --> 00:15:00,690
The building has extensive security.
It's nothing you can't handle.

243
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,901
We'll talk again once you're there.

244
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,155
Damn. She's close. Wasn't on the line
long enough to get an exact location.

245
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,324
- We need another call.
- Another call? No.

246
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,910
The guy has got an explosive
stuck in his head.

247
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:15,496
Chuck, our target is Sydney.
We need to get her to save him.

248
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:18,333
Okay. You get her,
I'll get Awesome to the 12th floor.

249
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,920
- Head inside the building and wait.
- Wait? Wait for what?

250
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,674
Wait for me.

251
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,513
Good luck.

252
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,311
Chuck?

253
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,855
- Chuck, where are you?
- I'm on my way, buddy.

254
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,359
Sir?

255
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,861
Here to see someone in the building?

256
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:55,536
Yeah. Yeah, kind of.

257
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:59,374
I'm here to meet my friend. Chuck.

258
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,630
Does this Chuck work here?

259
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,590
He could work here.

260
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:10,802
- He might.
- It's okay, pal. Take it easy.

261
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,053
I'm building security.

262
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:16,349
My name is Julius.
What's the problem?

263
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,020
You can tell me.

264
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:24,732
I'm involved in something
really messed up.

265
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,735
Been lying to my wife.
I'm lying to everybody.

266
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:32,407
- I can't take it anymore.
- Because of this Chuck guy?

267
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:34,117
Yeah. Yeah, Chuck.

268
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,744
I think I understand.

269
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:41,249
Look, pal, if you really love this Chuck,
you have to tell your wife.

270
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,251
You can't live a lie.

271
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:46,254
Trust me, I've been there.

272
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:49,465
- That's not really what I mean.
- Sure, it isn't.

273
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,342
- Uhn!
- Oh!

274
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,638
Chuck! You killed Julius!

275
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,933
What? Killed--? I never do this.
It's a tranq gun.

276
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:03,813
That's preposterous, killing someone.

277
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,441
Come on. Bingo.

278
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,193
He's gonna be fine. Come on.

279
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,456
So, what do you think is up there?
Something pretty gnarly, huh?

280
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:25,501
It's best not to speculate.
Nine times out of 10-- Well, seven.

281
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:27,962
--You get yourself all worked up
over nothing.

282
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:35,219
See? Nothing to worry about.

283
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,936
Hey. You're not allowed up here.

284
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:53,696
Look out.

285
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:02,330
You're incredible.
Was that your spy training?

286
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,373
"Duck Hunt." Nintendo.

287
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,879
- Devon?
- Yes, Sydney.

288
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,589
Good, you're alive.

289
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,342
Down the hall to your left
is an unmarked door.

290
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,511
The lock opens via retina scan.

291
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:20,014
Cut out one of the guards' eyes
and use it to open the door.

292
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,850
- What?
- We gotta cut out...

293
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:24,894
...one of these guys' eyes
for the scan.

294
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,188
I took an oath.
I can't cut out a man's eye.

295
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,398
I got a better idea.

296
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,400
Jeez, this guy is heavy.

297
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:34,529
Yeah. Well, bad guys don't count carbs,
buddy.

298
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,994
Okay.

299
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:48,084
Sarah, we have reached the 12th floor.
What is going on?

300
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:52,088
This is a CIA facility. Sarah, hello?

301
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,757
Chuck? Hello? I lost him.

302
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:57,802
Tracked her. She's--

303
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:00,555
She's right here.

304
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,226
That's her. Let's go.

305
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:08,771
What the hell?

306
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:11,232
Casey, Walker, stand down.

307
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,651
We have visual on Sydney.
Just walked past us.

308
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,778
She's heading inside the building.

309
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:23,244
I've just received
new mission information.

310
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,246
Your new directive
is to stand down.

311
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,416
Chuck has reached the 12th floor.
He says it's some CIA base.

312
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,251
If that's true, this is a setup.

313
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:34,130
Yes. That's exactly what this is.

314
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,136
Excellent work, Devon.
You're almost finished.

315
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,680
There's a man at the end of the hall.

316
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,266
Sydney says there's a man
at the end of the hall.

317
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,310
Find him.

318
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,187
And kill him.

319
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,273
She wants us to find him and kill him.

320
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:57,778
Nobody is gonna kill anybody. Okay?
Just calm down and stay close.

321
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:09,498
Excuse me, sir? Excuse me.

322
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,126
I know this is a little awkward,
but don't move.

323
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,463
- But also don't be afraid. My name is--
Chuck.

324
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:20,134
Chuck Bartowski. I know.

325
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,345
How--? How do you know that?

326
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:25,640
I know things. Lots of things.
About you. About them.

327
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:28,809
What do you know about The Ring?
Why do they need Devon?

328
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:31,812
They already have everything.
As simple as that.

329
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:34,315
Sydney will be here any minute.
Gotta do this.

330
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,525
You know she wants me to kill you,
right?

331
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:37,985
I'm not gonna do that.

332
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:40,154
- We do need a plan.
- I've got one.

333
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,990
You're gonna kill me, Chuck.

334
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:47,495
What? No.
No, no, no. I don't kill people.

335
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:50,206
Okay?
I have rules against such things.

336
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:54,585
- Shoot me. Here. Try to be precise.
- You listening to anything I'm saying?

337
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:58,506
I don't kill people. Don't shoot them.
Maybe a tranq gun. I'll tranq anybody.

338
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,175
But a "gun" gun? I hate "gun" guns.

339
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:04,387
If you don't kill me now,
you and Devon are as good as dead.

340
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:06,847
- Well, I'm not gonna do it.
- Chuck.

341
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,683
I have to die. Now.

342
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:11,435
The Ring knows too much.
There's no other way.

343
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:14,021
So just do it. Shoot me.

344
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,864
God, I-- I can't do-- I can't do it.

345
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:27,034
Afterward, put the gun in Devon's hands
and hide.

346
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:29,036
When she leaves, open this.

347
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:38,045
Truth is I hate guns too.

348
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,548
Who are you?

349
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:47,763
- Chuck.
- Huh?

350
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:50,599
What? What--? No. I didn't--
No, that's not me.

351
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,226
I didn't shoot him! I swear!

352
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:57,231
He's dead.

353
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,901
Chuck, this is not a tranq gun.

354
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:08,909
Okay. Listen to me.
Remember, you shot him.

355
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,729
Gun.

356
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:40,983
Take off the watch.

357
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:56,290
Well done.

358
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,627
Cute and talented.

359
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,130
What a catch.

360
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:10,137
Lose the body. Keep the phone.

361
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:11,305
We'll be in touch.

362
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,808
Welcome to The Ring, Devon.

363
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:22,066
Chuck, what the hell is going on
right now?

364
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,318
Okay.

365
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:32,034
"Med kit in desk.
The pill was amiodarone. Save me"?

366
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:35,162
Amiodarone.
Okay. Amiodarone stops your heart.

367
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:38,791
Only momentarily, though.
If it's a clean shot I think I can save him.

368
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:04,442
To answer your question,
my name is Shaw.

369
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:16,412
I would like to introduce you all
to CIA Special Agent Daniel Shaw.

370
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:20,624
For the last five years,
he's worked on taking out The Ring.

371
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:23,294
Agent Shaw has total
command authority...

372
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,504
...on any mission to do
with The Ring.

373
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:30,551
Really? This guy? I have back issues
of Guns & Ammo older than he is.

374
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:34,054
Be that as it may, you should know
that I have been fully briefed...

375
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,389
...on the Intersect.

376
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:40,227
That's right. I know everything.

377
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:46,233
Thank you, general.
I can take it from here.

378
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:47,902
Colonel, Walker, Chuck.

379
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:51,238
You're in good hands. Good luck.

380
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,991
Here's an overview of Ring intel.

381
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,162
Great. But Sydney is still out there.
My brother-in-law is still in danger.

382
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:02,541
Not for long. The Ring operates
through a network of decentralized cells.

383
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:05,961
We catch Sydney, there's a chance
we can contain Devon's identity.

384
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:08,672
He's a bona fide mole
in their operation.

385
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,717
In order to save him,
we have to use him.

386
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:14,428
What? No. No way.
I've already been over this.

387
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,597
Devon is out of the spy business.
For good.

388
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,390
As long as Sydney is alive...

389
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:20,518
- ...Devon is a marked man.
- She's right.

390
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:23,354
Casey, Sarah, please.
Explain the risks to him.

391
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,898
Risks are greater for Devon
if we don't use him.

392
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,734
Sydney would sooner kill him
than let him go.

393
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:31,278
Well, I don't care. He's not a spy.

394
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:35,699
Well, Chuck, I guess the question is,
do you have a better plan?

395
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:49,505
Okay, where in the hell is everyone?

396
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,055
What is that?

397
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:01,433
- Go! Get him! Get him!
- Let's go!

398
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:04,728
- Yeah!
- There you go! There you go!

399
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:07,273
- Come on! Kill him!
- Come on! Take that!

400
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,316
Fight club.

401
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:13,279
Of course. Of course.
No, no, no. We cannot have this, guys.

402
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:15,573
Come on. There's insurance issues.

403
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:21,829
Done.

404
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:24,540
Who's next?

405
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,961
- Who wants to regain their manhood?
- Lester, come on.

406
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:32,172
We can't have this anymore.
You have to cut this out.

407
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,049
It'll be okay.

408
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,135
Like talking to a wall.

409
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:38,304
- I'm liking that.
- Come on. Come on.

410
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:42,308
Lester. A little help, please.

411
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:45,811
No! No! Let me out of here!

412
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,479
Let me out of here!

413
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,357
Don't-- Dude, don't--
Do not hook that up.

414
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:52,860
- I'm trying to help them.
- Don't do it please.

415
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,366
Okay. No, no. Hey, listen to me.
Back to work.

416
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:01,493
All right? Fight club is over.

417
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:05,539
Over? Nothing is over
until we say it's over.

418
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:09,668
You may have shut this down,
but you will never shut us down...

419
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,464
...Ass Man.

420
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,222
Are you all gonna--?

421
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,977
Nice.
Okay, at least unplug the battery.

422
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:30,689
Hey. What's up? Everything okay?

423
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:34,526
Please don't say another mission.
I can't take this anymore.

424
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:35,736
I'm freaking out.

425
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:39,073
Don't worry. No more missions.
I'm sorry I put you through this.

426
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,617
I promised I'd take care of it.
Give me the phone.

427
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:47,831
Thanks.

428
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,765
- Chuck, are you in there?
- Oh.

429
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:07,017
There you are.
I've been looking all over.

430
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:10,771
Can I talk to you for a second?
Because I'm in a crisis.

431
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:13,107
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So am I.

432
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:15,275
Yeah, you are.
My man is still working.

433
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,903
An assistant manager's dream.

434
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,738
On to my nightmare.

435
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:21,949
Lester turned the cage
into a fight club...

436
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:24,410
...and attached a battery to the fence
so he can shock people.

437
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:28,747
You smell that?
That's burnt human hair, dude.

438
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:31,291
Told them to stop. No one would listen.

439
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:33,961
No one will listen to anything
I have to say.

440
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:36,547
My job is on the line here.

441
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:39,299
Yeah. Well, it sounds
like you need a plan, buddy.

442
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:41,218
That's exactly what I need, dude.

443
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:44,972
I was thinking-- I was--
You know, I probably need a plan here.

444
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,725
But what plan, you know?

445
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,649
You know,
sometimes what I like to do...

446
00:28:55,817 --> 00:29:00,320
...is open up a problem, really examine it
to find its weak points...

447
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:04,616
...and then not be afraid to just attack it
head-on.

448
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:08,328
Wow. Wow.

449
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:10,122
That's some powerful stuff.

450
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,583
Yeah. I think that will work.
Thanks, man.

451
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:13,792
Yeah, buddy.

452
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:27,681
How did you open this channel?
Who is this?

453
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,975
I'm the spy who killed Agent Shaw.

454
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:32,019
This is not Devon Woodcomb.

455
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:35,647
You've been dealing with
the wrong man. Devon was a decoy.

456
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:39,693
I'm the one that put that bullet
through Agent Shaw's chest last night.

457
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:44,323
I'm the spy that you're looking for.
And I am in charge of this mission now.

458
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:52,206
Hey. Hey, Sarah. It's Chuck.

459
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:55,083
Don't be mad.
I may or may not have called Sydney...

460
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:58,587
...on the Ring phone so she would
track me here. It's a trap. My trap.

461
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:01,215
You told Sydney
to go to the Buy More?

462
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:05,010
My God. It worked. They're here.

463
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,846
Grab Casey and get up here
so we can take them out.

464
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,473
Chuck, what are you? Crazy?

465
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:14,603
Not very smart, Chuck.
This is not how I do business.

466
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:18,357
You start things on your own,
you better be prepared to finish them.

467
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:20,776
On your own. Good luck.

468
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:24,947
He hung up on me.

469
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:27,616
Without us he doesn't have a chance.

470
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:30,619
He's gonna panic,
then he's not gonna perform properly.

471
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:32,412
Happens to lots of guys.

472
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:34,081
Or so I hear.

473
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:37,209
Besides, I'm kind of curious
about what his plan is.

474
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:41,046
This isn't part of the plan.

475
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,756
Oh, this is very, very bad.

476
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:58,397
Hello, Sydney.

477
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,817
Welcome to the Burbank Buy More.

478
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:05,654
Please proceed directly
to the Home Theater room.

479
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:08,115
Find him.

480
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:10,951
I would suggest the best way
to the Home Theater room...

481
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,620
...is through the MP3/gaming aisle.

482
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:18,625
But beware. You break, you buy it.

483
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:24,172
Hello, sir.
The store's closed at the moment.

484
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:28,093
If you wanna come back in the morning,
we'll be open around 10:00.

485
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:34,099
You're signing his death warrant.

486
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:36,143
Ye of little faith.

487
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,520
- No. This is crazy. I am going out.
- So am I.

488
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:42,482
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you two
to stand down.

489
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:46,570
Don't like guns much,
but when necessary I will use them.

490
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:51,658
Finally, we meet.

491
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,327
In an electronics store.

492
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:56,872
Which is different.

493
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:59,041
No matter.

494
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:01,960
When we last chatted,
you mentioned a certain Agent Shaw.

495
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:03,170
That's right.

496
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,172
I'm the one who ended Shaw's life...

497
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,841
...not Devon Woodcomb.
He was just a patsy.

498
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:10,218
You took out Shaw?

499
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:15,515
Mr. Buy More.

500
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:18,477
In a nutshell.
That's kind of what happened.

501
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:20,354
Well, then, if that's true...

502
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:23,523
...you won't have any problem
with Glen and Ian here.

503
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,983
Glen and Ian?

504
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:28,904
Sure. Well, you should know,
Glen and Ian, Ian and Glen...

505
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:31,698
...that if you take one more step,
I will drop you.

506
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:35,911
Come on flash. Flash.

507
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:42,501
Okay. Okay, now I'm angry.

508
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:45,712
I'm angry and in a great deal of pain.

509
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,218
Ohh...

510
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:01,895
Get him.

511
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:06,775
- That was his plan.
- I'm going in. Shoot me if you have to.

512
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:08,652
Hey!

513
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:14,408
You're fast.

514
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:17,744
There's something else
you should know about me. I love guns.

515
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,582
Good boy.

516
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,470
Go. I got these guys.

517
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:47,065
Check the cage.

518
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:44,122
Stop! Do not move!

519
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:52,047
Or what? Hmm?

520
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,300
Please, just do what I say.

521
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:58,136
Spies don't say please.

522
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:03,308
Now, Devon, he would have a bullet
between my eyes by now.

523
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,645
All right. Your choice. Live or die.

524
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:09,981
That's better.

525
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:13,026
What are you doing? Do not do that!
Do not do that.

526
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:14,361
It's just the phone.

527
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:18,073
You do want it, don't you?

528
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:23,203
Or if you can't think of a use for it,
I'm sure I can.

529
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:27,207
I can make a phone call
and have 50 operatives here.

530
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:30,001
Don't make me shoot you.

531
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:33,088
I don't think you can.

532
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:34,589
Chuck!

533
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:54,109
Like I said, I hate guns.

534
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,444
But it pays to know how to use one.

535
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:12,127
I suppose congratulations are in order.
Devon's identity has been contained.

536
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:15,881
- We got lucky this time, Shaw.
- Yeah.

537
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:17,507
And risked my family doing it.

538
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,844
There's something you need to know.

539
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:25,849
There's nothing that I care about more
than my friends and my family.

540
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,768
I don't expect you to understand.

541
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:31,688
Being the spy that you are,
you don't care about anybody.

542
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:34,232
Families and friends
make us vulnerable.

543
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,484
Make us unable to pull the trigger.

544
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:40,447
And that puts everyone
in even greater danger.

545
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:42,073
Just ask your partner here.

546
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,411
She'll tell you the same thing.

547
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:51,333
Sometimes it helps to know
that you've got something to lose.

548
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:22,322
Morgan.

549
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:27,535
Come out and play.

550
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:29,287
Morgan.

551
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:32,540
Come out and play.

552
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,588
Grimes. Get over here.

553
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:45,512
You have got to get your house
in order, son.

554
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:50,058
I know. I know I do. I don't get it.
I thought we were all friends here.

555
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:53,687
You ain't.
First rule of Big Mike management:

556
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:57,148
You can't be afraid to pull the trigger.

557
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:03,029
Pull the trigger. Right.

558
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:08,660
Lester.

559
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:12,163
You know,
a wise man once told me...

560
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:15,750
...that you need to assess a problem
then attack it head-on.

561
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,920
You are a problem.

562
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:21,923
Your behavior
will no longer be tolerated.

563
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:26,094
So here are the first, second
and third rules of the Buy More:

564
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:30,015
Do what you're told,
do it with respect or--

565
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:31,266
Or what?

566
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,602
Hmm? You'll fight me?

567
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:40,775
- I'll fire you.
- You don't have the cojones.

568
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:43,111
Yeah.

569
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:45,947
You're fired.
Pack up your hard drives.

570
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:48,283
The rest of you, back to work.

571
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,660
Morgan-- Morgan, Morgan, Morgan.
Come on, man.

572
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:53,830
Okay, look, hey.
We were just having a little fun.

573
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,791
- Okay? I take it back.
- Goodbye, Lester.

574
00:38:57,376 --> 00:39:00,462
Dude, don't do this.
Okay, you know I need this job.

575
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:02,630
I gotta get out of my mom's place.

576
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,885
For God's sakes, man,
I got nowhere else to go.

577
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:12,432
Yeah, okay. You're re-hired.

578
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,559
- But you're on probation.
- Okay.

579
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,604
- Double secret.
- Double secret?

580
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:27,739
Strong, Morgan. Real strong.

581
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:34,245
Was that--? Bigger dog.
Medium-sized dog. Bigger?

582
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:54,933
Hey, Chuck, you got that, dude?
I'm woking and rolling over here.

583
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:02,357
- Hi ho, neighbors. Hi.
- Yeah. Hey, guys.

584
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:04,901
Welcome to our-formerly-your home.

585
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,779
Hope everybody is hungry.
I made my Teriyaki Surprise.

586
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:10,782
Surprise is the teriyaki.

587
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:14,661
- I think I've had enough surprises lately.
- Oh, Devon, stop it.

588
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,955
I'm sure we'll love it, Morgan.

589
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:19,040
Mostly sure.

590
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:23,795
Hey, buddy.
That thing that we were dealing with?

591
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:27,382
It's been taken care of.
We caught her.

592
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:29,968
Everything is gonna be just fine.

593
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:34,597
There it is. That's enough now.

594
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:37,058
Hey. What am I?
Chopped scallions over here?

595
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:39,602
No love for Buy More's
new assistant manager or--?

596
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,147
What? That's great. Congratulations.

597
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:44,649
Assistant manager?

598
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:46,401
Congratulations, buddy.

599
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,903
Honey, you're hurting him.
Put him down.

600
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:52,615
Oh. I hope you don't mind.
I invited Sarah as well.

601
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:55,201
Oh, really? I'll get the door.

602
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:59,080
- Oh, Casey too.
- What?

603
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:02,959
- Hi, Ellie.
- Hi, Sarah. Good to see you.

604
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:07,672
- Ellie.
- Casey. You've had enough of that.

605
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:13,428
- What's with her?
- No idea.

606
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,015
- Hi.
- Hi.

607
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:20,393
Wouldn't have been the same
without you.

608
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:24,189
- I'm really glad you made it.
- Me too.

609
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:48,505
- Hey, it looks good, Morgan.
- Yeah. Well.

610
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:51,799
You really worked hard, I can tell.
