1
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:10,092
No one stops us.

2
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:12,428
No one ever has.

3
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,558
Chuck, did you just flash?

4
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:20,227
- Oh, Chuck me.
- Kill him.

5
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:31,905
Chuck?

6
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:33,824
Guys...

7
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,327
...I know kung fu.

8
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:52,843
Agent Carmichael.

9
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:54,970
Call me Charles.

10
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:58,474
You have something that belongs
to my boss. The case.

11
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:01,393
I would like for you to give it to me.

12
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,146
Please.

13
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:06,440
You show up with no gun...

14
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,317
...and "please"...

15
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:11,070
...and what, I quiver in fear?

16
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,654
We've got a lock on the case.

17
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,364
It's in the room with you.

18
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:24,666
Give me the case or else.

19
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,668
Or else what?

20
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,631
Or else I do this?

21
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:39,473
No.

22
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:42,101
I was thinking something more
like this.

23
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:47,356
Cool, cool, cool. Everybody be cool.
Everybody just chill out.

24
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:48,690
Very, very good.

25
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:51,693
On the ground, now. Nice and easy.

26
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:54,530
Yuri, hand me that case.
After that, it's pierogi time.

27
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:57,199
- No.
- Shoot him, Chuck.

28
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,203
So do it.

29
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:02,704
Shoot me.

30
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,123
Don't mess with me, Yuri.

31
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,791
Shoot him now.

32
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,042
Get him.

33
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:33,402
Chuck, what is happening?
Your heart rate spiked. You okay?

34
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,072
I'm okay. I got punched in the face,
and it's throbbing a little bit.

35
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,575
Get out of there now.

36
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,581
- Where's my exit?
- They're closing in on you. Get to a roof.

37
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,708
The chopper's inbound.

38
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,838
General, I don't wanna sound
demanding here...

39
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,756
...but I could use that chopper now!

40
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:56,008
The chopper's too far.

41
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,927
There's a line on the roof
that runs to the next building.

42
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:00,762
Zip-line across. We'll find you--

43
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:04,892
- What do you mean, zip-line?
- It's in the Intersect.

44
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,268
Okay, I got this.

45
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:22,242
- General, I'm not flashing.
- Do it, Chuck. Flash.

46
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,286
If you stress me,
it's never gonna work.

47
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:26,705
- Chuck, flash!
- Okay.

48
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,127
Flash.

49
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,629
One, two, three, flash.

50
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:36,590
I don't think my vertigo's helping here.

51
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,425
General, are you there?

52
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,553
- General!
- You're dead.

53
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:53,065
That's all, Frank.
Terminate the simulation.

54
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,901
Copy that, ma'am.

55
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,530
Chuck...

56
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:02,908
...you can come down now.

57
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,165
- Why didn't you shoot Yuri?
- Well, we were very close...

58
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,669
...and while I realize it's just
a simulation, safety first, you know.

59
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:16,964
To be honest, I'm not comfortable
with the shooting-people thing.

60
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,257
This isn't working out.

61
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:21,301
Look, general, I realize that we've had
our setbacks, I do.

62
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,637
But let's not dwell in the past here.

63
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,139
I'm convinced I can be a great spy.
I know it.

64
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,475
We spent millions
to get you up and running...

65
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,978
...as our new Intersect agent.
It's not working.

66
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:32,980
My dad can help.
He built the computer.

67
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:35,440
The problem is not with the computer.

68
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:36,858
It's with you.

69
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:41,363
The Intersect 2.0 was designed
to go into a real spy, like Bryce Larkin.

70
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,699
Someone in complete control
of their feelings.

71
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,325
What are you saying?

72
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:47,160
It's over.

73
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:50,205
Our Los Angeles field unit
will keep an eye on you...

74
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:53,458
...until a final decision can be made
regarding your status.

75
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:54,876
Hold on a second here.

76
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:58,046
You're firing me? Do you have any idea
what I gave up for this?

77
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:00,382
- Goodbye.
- You don't know what I said no to!

78
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:02,050
Frank.

79
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,977
Go home, tell your sister
you're going on a trip to Europe. Six weeks.

80
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,478
Where are we really going?

81
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,689
A red site training facility.

82
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:19,901
- Training for what?
- For you, moron. The new Intersect.

83
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,738
They're gonna train you
and turn you into a super spy.

84
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:27,075
Did Casey tell you they're moving me
to a facility? I'm gonna be a spy.

85
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,745
- I know, I heard. Come on.
- What--?

86
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,873
What's the matter?

87
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:36,043
If you go, you're gonna be a spy
for the rest of your life.

88
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,754
Every city is gonna be a new mission,
a new identity.

89
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:40,756
You're not gonna be the same person.

90
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,426
- Yeah, that's a great thing.
- Chuck, listen.

91
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:45,677
We could--

92
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:47,637
We could what?

93
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,140
We could run.

94
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:52,768
Together. You and me.

95
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:55,437
We go now and we never look back.

96
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:59,775
- Are you serious?
- I have some money saved up.

97
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:02,569
I'd get us some new identities,
create an escape route.

98
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:06,448
Go to the training facility in Prague,
meet me at the Nadrazi train station...

99
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:10,410
...in three weeks' time at 7:00,
and then I can figure the rest out later.

100
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,621
What are you saying?

101
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:17,793
I'm saying I wanna be
a real person again. With you.

102
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,047
This is what you want, right?

103
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,758
I mean, this is it, Chuck.

104
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,468
Will you run away with me?

105
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,813
Yeah.

106
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,068
Chuck?

107
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,320
Chuck, what happened?

108
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,741
Chuck, honey, where's Sarah?

109
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,411
I lost her.

110
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:55,497
The girl of my dreams.
It was all my fault.

111
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:59,000
Maybe not. Why don't you pick up
the phone and call her?

112
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,795
You guys can work it out.
I'm sure she misses you too.

113
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,689
Your phone, my dear.

114
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,197
Pick up, Sarah.

115
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,054
- Morning, Chuck.
- Morning, bro.

116
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,263
Mm-hm.

117
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:38,058
Chuck, you feeling any better?
You got a game plan? Job hunting?

118
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,267
Probably not.

119
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:46,149
No rush, amigo, but how long
do you think you'll be staying?

120
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,752
Chuck?

121
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,588
Chuck.

122
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,801
Chuck, if you won't talk to me,
then you have a visitor.

123
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,053
Chuck.

124
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,847
Chuck.

125
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,141
It's me, man.

126
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,060
Morgan?

127
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,520
- Morgan?
- Yeah.

128
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,274
- Is that you?
- It is. It is.

129
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:29,693
I'm back for a few days.
Hawaii's great.

130
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,113
And Benihana, forget about it.
Flying through the ranks.

131
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,615
That's it.
I'm gonna be master chef in no time.

132
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:38,410
I'm so proud of you.
We should get together soon.

133
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,328
- You and I sit down-- Ehh.
- I'd love that.

134
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,623
Hm.

135
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,088
Worse than I thought.

136
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,382
All right, Chuck, that is enough.
Sit up.

137
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:57,762
You are getting off this couch and you
are going to do something today.

138
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,723
Out. Out.

139
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:00,974
I tried, guys.

140
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:04,436
Just leave him with his cheese balls.
That's all he cares about.

141
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:37,469
Hello, sir. How may I service you?

142
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,803
Uh...

143
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,222
I'm looking for cheese puffs.

144
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:44,142
Aisle 3.
It's been a pleasure serving you.

145
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:54,861
Look at that wretch.

146
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:57,989
Security, we have a street person
in Aisle 3.

147
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,408
Could be the one stealing toilet paper.

148
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,628
Gotcha. Hand it over, punk.

149
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,257
Bartowski?

150
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,472
Oh, Chuck Bartowski?

151
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:27,936
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.

152
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:32,148
Get a good look, everybody. Everybody.
Everybody come hither. Come hither.

153
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:34,109
Take a sniff.

154
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,365
That is the putrid stench of failure.

155
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,284
That's why you don't leave
the Buy More. Yeah.

156
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:45,954
You become feral.

157
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:47,497
Wretched.

158
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,333
You're just another loser.

159
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:55,130
My god, you're pathetic.

160
00:11:55,423 --> 00:12:00,510
Sneaking back into the Buy More
like some vagrant Serpico.

161
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,765
Goodness, you're a hot mess.

162
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,767
Emmett, please...

163
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,187
I'm sorry, do you have something to say?
Right here.

164
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,362
No, I have nothing to say.
I'm okay. I'm good.

165
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,574
Oh, that's what I thought.

166
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,409
Oh, it's a good thing.

167
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:29,789
Because you don't know how close
you came to getting your ass kicked.

168
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,047
Oh, captain, my captain.

169
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:40,925
Tell us that you've returned
to take control of Buy More.

170
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,803
Look, I'm sorry, fellas.

171
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:46,765
I'm sorry.
I don't think I could help even if I tried.

172
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,434
What do you care about our troubles?
You got blondie.

173
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,644
- We're not--
She's getting hotter.

174
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:55,106
Agreed. Her ass seems to be lifting,
ever so slightly. Charles--

175
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,816
- What?
- Ass.

176
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,902
No, what? You've seen her?

177
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:02,739
Just through a telescope when she goes
in and out of that nasty yogurt shop.

178
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,451
She's still here.

179
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,583
Sarah?

180
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,585
Hello?

181
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:30,809
Heard you were a lemon,
but this is pathetic.

182
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,852
Even for you.

183
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:38,900
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I think that I left a light jacket in Castle.

184
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,152
I was just here to pick it up.

185
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,822
Clean those up.

186
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:47,158
Hurry it up. I have to finish packing.

187
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,077
What's been going on in the biz?

188
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:52,247
You talk to any of the old gang?

189
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:53,748
Sarah, for instance?

190
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,583
Nope.

191
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:00,922
- Really?
- Yeah?

192
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,424
- Mm-hm.
- Can I talk to her when you're done?

193
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,051
Yeah.

194
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,136
Seven. Mm-hm.

195
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:08,513
- Yeah.
- Just tell her--

196
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,349
If you could just ask her
if she's gotten my messages...

197
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,102
...because I've been calling at lot.

198
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:15,478
It's the lemon.

199
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,815
Duly noted. See you tonight.

200
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,778
Did she say anything about me?

201
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:24,988
Nope.

202
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:30,201
You going on a mission?
You need back up? I can still flash.

203
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,620
Not what I heard.

204
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,915
Come on, Casey, please.
Beckman canned me, all right, man?

205
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:40,128
I need to prove to her that I can
still do this. That I can still be a spy.

206
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,131
- Can you?
- Yes, I can. And it's gonna work, too.

207
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:46,718
If I help you guys, then maybe Beckman
puts the old team back together.

208
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,471
And all my dreams come true.

209
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,440
- What?
- I'm heading out.

210
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:05,028
Enjoy your spy-game thing,
and stay in touch.

211
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,487
Hey.

212
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,698
What happened
between you and Walker?

213
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,535
Something I need to fix.

214
00:15:56,997 --> 00:16:01,084
Somebody called about a computer
emergency. Soundboard's down.

215
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,878
- Okay.
- Cool. Thanks.

216
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,935
Walker, we have a situation.

217
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:44,460
Hello, Chuck.
What are you doing here?

218
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:47,630
Don't worry, this is not about us.
I'm purely here for backup.

219
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,257
- I need to prove to--
- Kiss me.

220
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,552
What? Right now? We should talk first.
I'm getting mixed signals.

221
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,679
Kiss me now.

222
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,068
Who the hell is that?

223
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,739
Just my ex.
He's having some trouble letting go.

224
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,790
- Why did you knock him out?
- It was a slap.

225
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,292
Lemon's got a glass jaw.

226
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,794
I was caught off guard
on an empty stomach, okay?

227
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,963
I didn't eat anything.
I can take a punch.

228
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:31,174
You mean a slap.

229
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:36,262
I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry, guys.

230
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,390
I didn't mean to screw anything up.
I just came here to help.

231
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:43,144
Things went wrong in Prague, I don't
know why, but I know I can do this.

232
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,353
I can be a spy.

233
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:51,069
Sarah, you know I can, please.

234
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,030
Get him out of here.

235
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,451
You heard the lady. Get out of here.

236
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,953
Casey, wait, wait, wait.
I can help you.

237
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,747
It's a simple courier exchange.

238
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,792
Gilles, the guy with Walker,
he's the mark.

239
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:09,087
- He's meeting with a Ring operative.
- The Ring? They killed Bryce.

240
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,839
The moment the Ring courier
meets Gilles, we strike.

241
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,633
Get out before you spook Javier.

242
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:16,677
- Who?
- The courier. Javier Cruz.

243
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:18,262
Get him out of here.

244
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,057
Javier Cruz. Javier Cruz.

245
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,853
Casey, Javier's not a courier!

246
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,814
No, guys. Guys, you have to listen.

247
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:30,149
Javier's not who you think.
He's an assassin.

248
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,944
Trust me! He's here to kill someone.

249
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,279
I dumped the lemon.

250
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:43,246
Let me back in! Let me back in!

251
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,419
Okay, okay.

252
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:52,797
All right. All right.

253
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,340
Oh, son of a--

254
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:55,883
That's gonna leave a mark.

255
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,553
Okay. Okay. Calm down, Chuck.

256
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,429
Don't be emotional.

257
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,019
Excuse me, por favor--

258
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,694
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

259
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,612
Oh, I'm so sorry.

260
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,156
My bad. Wake up. Wake up.

261
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,741
Oh, God. Oh, no.

262
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,504
- You're on.
- What?

263
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,132
- Let's go.
- No, no, wait. I have to use the boy's--

264
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,800
The chico's room. Amigo's room.

265
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:54,901
Hey, where's Manny?

266
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,820
Spastic colon. I'm filling in for him.

267
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,159
He's gonna blow the whole op.

268
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,912
Just give him a second.

269
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,709
Bueno. Bueno. Bueno.

270
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,935
Where the hell did he learn that?

271
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:39,904
- Isn't that your ex?
- Yeah, he's a bit of a show-off.

272
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,239
Just ignore him.

273
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:43,950
Assassin.

274
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,244
Assassin.

275
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,162
Where?

276
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:05,012
Do you want my men
to take care of your ex?

277
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,306
No. Come and dance with me.

278
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,327
What is he doing here?

279
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:32,456
He's just trying to make you jealous.
And that's supposed to be your job.

280
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:41,632
Wait. How did he know you were here?
Who is he really?

281
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,719
Tranq him. Take him out now.

282
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:57,648
You have nothing to worry about.

283
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,458
Sarah!

284
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:20,212
- What is going on here?
- Don't move. Don't you move!

285
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,841
Chuck, what the hell are you doing?

286
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:27,011
There's an assassin here.
There's an assassin here!

287
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,013
He was gonna kill her. Kill you.

288
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,182
Where? Where is he?

289
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:35,686
- Half this club is undercover.
- Been planning this for months.

290
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,856
Good thing we brought
this many agents. I'm gonna kill you.

291
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,316
Casey.

292
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:44,695
Sarah, I flashed. I swear to you,
there was an assassin. It was Javier.

293
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,072
Now we'll never know.

294
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:50,618
You don't work anymore, Chuck.
It's over.

295
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:05,758
- Good morning.
- Morning.

296
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:08,594
Chuck, you shaved. That's great.

297
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,263
It was a rash decision.

298
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:15,017
I can't watch him wallow around all day.
It's pathetic.

299
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,733
What's up, bro?

300
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,319
Still playing the loser cover?
You're nailing it.

301
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:28,322
Not a cover. It's my life.

302
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:31,659
I was fired. For real.
I'm not a spy anymore.

303
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:36,288
And to be perfectly honest,
I'm not sure I ever really was.

304
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:38,499
Whoa, wait.

305
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,000
This is really you?

306
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:43,421
Maybe we should be introduced.
I'm Chuck Bartowski, total loser.

307
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,548
Cheese ball addict.

308
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,468
Does the CIA let you just leave
like that?

309
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,930
Don't they send someone to, like,
kill you or something?

310
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:56,934
I think you watch too many movies.

311
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:23,127
- Ah! Don't kill me!
- Ah!

312
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,337
Holy, dude. It's just-- It's me.

313
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:28,841
Ellie thought I should come by and--
Thought I might cheer you up.

314
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:33,304
Yeah, well, thanks, but I wish everyone
would just leave me alone. I'm fine.

315
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,222
No, you're not, dude.

316
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,391
Come on.
I've known you a long time, pal.

317
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:40,686
You're slightly unmotivated,
a bit of an underachiever...

318
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,314
...but a loser? That's not your turf.

319
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,900
What's going on?

320
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,196
I blew it, buddy.

321
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:51,989
Opportunity of a lifetime.

322
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:56,076
I had a job offer that would have
included a lot of travel and excitement.

323
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:58,412
And I've already been
fired from it twice.

324
00:24:58,622 --> 00:24:59,830
Amateur hour.

325
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:02,082
You haven't even scratched
the surface.

326
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,542
You wanna see rock bottom?

327
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,420
Okay. Follow me, sir.

328
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,924
I got canned from Benihana
a few weeks ago.

329
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,926
And Anna took off with the prep chef.

330
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:13,427
I lost my mojo.

331
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:16,722
Couldn't flip the shrimp.
Couldn't flip the shrimp.

332
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,187
Bed, TV.

333
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:25,523
Microwave for meals.

334
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,776
And, of course, machines for laundry.

335
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,778
Drink it in, Chuck.

336
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,781
- This is as low as a man can get.
- Grimes.

337
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,784
So he's been the one stealing the TP.

338
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:40,287
I should have known he'd never make it
in Asian business culture.

339
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:43,290
I'll have the authorities deal with him
tomorrow.

340
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:52,967
I'm gonna miss this.

341
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:54,760
What?

342
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:58,764
M134 Minigun.
Thirty-four hundred rounds a minute.

343
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,683
Never got to use her.

344
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,981
- Poor bastard.
- Who?

345
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,732
Moron that's in love with you.

346
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,818
I promise you,
he is not in love with me.

347
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:13,571
Come on. I don't know what happened
between you two.

348
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:17,449
I've seen men have their fingernails
pulled off treated more humanely...

349
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:20,494
- ...than you did that kid.
- Well, I was just doing my job.

350
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:21,996
Job's over.

351
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:23,622
Put him out of his misery.

352
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,292
He deserves that much.

353
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,429
Some day
Somebody's gonna

354
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:41,015
Turn around
And make you wanna say goodbye

355
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,309
Until then baby
are you going to let them

356
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:45,352
Wait a second.

357
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,687
Don't you know?

358
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,022
Hello.

359
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:50,149
Things can change
Things'll go your way

360
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:53,152
If you hold on...

361
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:56,864
Uh... Can I help you?

362
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,366
Hold on for one more day

363
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:01,869
Where can I find this man?

364
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,203
Oh, don't ask me.

365
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:05,372
He's no longer an employee
at this store.

366
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,667
If you wanna find him,
walk out front and follow the smell.

367
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,671
You can leave now.

368
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,676
Okay. Okay.

369
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:20,304
We can do this the easy way...

370
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,390
...or the hard way.

371
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,851
I got mace.

372
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:27,686
Yeah.

373
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:31,857
So you'd better get
your Brokeback boots off my property...

374
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:35,235
...or I'm gonna send you crying
back to your mommy's womb.

375
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,073
Yeah.

376
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:42,993
Pussy.

377
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:06,183
Say goodbye forever, pal.
Had some good years here.

378
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:10,104
Yeah, to be honest, I think
I'd rather forget it all ever happened.

379
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,943
Right. Why don't I give you guys
a few seconds?

380
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,945
- I'll see you back at your place.
- Yeah.

381
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,530
- Thanks, buddy.
- Yeah, yeah.

382
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,907
- Hey, Sarah.
- Hey.

383
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,124
I wanted to say a proper goodbye.

384
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:40,551
It's been a pleasure working with you,
Agent Walker.

385
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,345
You too, Agent Bartowski.

386
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:49,893
I appreciate that, but we both know
that the agent thing didn't work out.

387
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:52,980
- If I could go back in time--
- Uh, Chuck--

388
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,982
Please let me get this off my chest.

389
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,401
I can live knowing
that I told you everything.

390
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,153
- You owe me that.
- Yeah, Chuck--

391
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,908
And I owed you that.

392
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:45,032
Oh, Javier.

393
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:48,076
You know, I think we actually got off
on the wrong foot.

394
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:50,329
Truth be told,
I'm a fan of mariachi music.

395
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:53,415
And my hitting you
was completely unintentional.

396
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,835
- I wanna know who you are.
- Nobody. I'm nobody.

397
00:29:57,003 --> 00:30:01,548
In fact, I think that I have documentation
somewhere that proves that I'm nobody.

398
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:03,926
Wow, you are extremely ripped, sir.

399
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,720
You hit me very well outside the club.

400
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:12,267
Try that again.

401
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,561
Okay, let's do this. Let's do this.

402
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:18,273
Come on! Flash.

403
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:21,235
Okay. If you could just give me
one second, I can--

404
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,912
You're gonna tell me everything,
Mr. Bartowski.

405
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,413
All the secrets you know.

406
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:35,457
Who you are.

407
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,417
Who you work for.

408
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:41,547
And then you're gonna tell me
about the girl.

409
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:46,301
You should go to Prague.

410
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:49,471
Then meet me at Nadrazi station
in three weeks' time at 7:00...

411
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,974
...and then I can figure
the rest out later.

412
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:22,087
Here is your ticket
and your new passport.

413
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:23,964
Your name is Hector Calderon.

414
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:25,674
- Wait--
- Talk on the train.

415
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,426
Right now, we have to act fast.

416
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,095
Trust me, Chuck.
It's all gonna work out fine.

417
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:47,946
Uh...

418
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,533
That's not the kiss
that I was expecting.

419
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:56,038
Sarah, there's an entire facility here...

420
00:31:56,247 --> 00:32:00,167
...dedicated and designed to turning me
into Intersect 2.0. Think about it.

421
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,793
Me, a real spy.

422
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:04,963
Living a life of adventure
and doing things that really matter.

423
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:08,008
It's not that simple.
You don't know who you're working for.

424
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,177
That's complicated. Nothing is real.

425
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:11,678
But this...

426
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,182
This is simple.

427
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,351
This is a real life.

428
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,813
We have to go, Chuck. This is it.

429
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:23,982
Are you coming?

430
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,882
I can't.

431
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:54,388
I'm sorry.

432
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,394
I'm sorry.

433
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:09,528
- Any sign of Walker?
- Last ping had her at the Buy More.

434
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:18,954
You gotta be kidding me.

435
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:23,125
I want a satellite trace on every car
in the parking lot in the last six hours.

436
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,919
- Do it. Get a chopper ready.
- Sir, on whose authority?

437
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,587
Mine.

438
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:29,464
The colonel.

439
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,758
Come on, Chuck. You can do this.

440
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:36,847
Just one flash of kung fu
and we are out of here.

441
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:43,478
I'm dead. I'm so completely dead.

442
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:45,605
What am I gonna do?

443
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:49,151
Chuck? Chuck, can you hear me?

444
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:52,821
- Sarah?
- Break out of your cell and come get me.

445
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,865
I couldn't pick this stupid lock.

446
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:58,285
There's no way
that we could reverse those roles?

447
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:01,455
You've been trained to do this.
The Intersect can do this.

448
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:03,957
You don't get it.
You and Casey were right. Okay?

449
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,584
I'm a lemon. I don't work.

450
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:08,962
My emotions just mess everything up.

451
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,297
No.

452
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:13,467
Chuck, listen. I was mad and wrong.

453
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:17,596
Since you went to Prague, I have worked
with the best spies, and you know what?

454
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,806
They're on their way here to save us?

455
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,809
None of them can do
what you can do.

456
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:26,980
You're a spy. Now flash on Javier
and get us out of here.

457
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,193
- Something's happening here, Sarah.
- Chuck...

458
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:33,612
...don't freak out.

459
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:46,875
When I'm done with you,
I'm gonna deal with her.

460
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:48,210
The girl.

461
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,217
Me first.

462
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:04,643
Chuck, what happened?

463
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:09,981
Something awesome.

464
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,701
- Let's go.
- Hey, you should have seen it.

465
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:24,538
- I knocked him out with one punch.
- Let's talk and run.

466
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:27,666
- Where are we?
- Mexico.

467
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:43,223
I'm almost out.
We need to get off this roof.

468
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,281
- What are you doing?
- Zip-line.

469
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:01,867
It'll work. I promise.

470
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:03,410
Okay. I trust you.

471
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,123
Hold on tight!

472
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:24,389
- I can't believe that worked.
- I'm not so sure it did.

473
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,616
- There's something I need to tell you.
- Not now, Chuck.

474
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,827
I think this might be my last chance.

475
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,674
Down.

476
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:03,136
Ha, ha, ha, ha! Whoo-hoo!

477
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:08,975
Move, move, move! Let's go, boys!

478
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:18,151
Yeah!

479
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,157
Move, move, move.

480
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:27,994
Let's go.

481
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,165
Yeah.

482
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,627
Whoo-hoo!

483
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:41,841
Javier Cruz was a vital operative
for The Ring's Mexico syndicate.

484
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:45,512
The device you picked up is a custom
smartphone for Ring operatives.

485
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,722
This is the first one
we have ever captured.

486
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,766
Hey, good job, Team Bartowski.

487
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,686
Colonel Casey and I will be departing
for Lisbon tonight.

488
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:55,188
There's been chatter
another Ring cell is there.

489
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,107
That won't be necessary.

490
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:01,695
- Why not?
- I can't believe I'm about to say this.

491
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:03,405
Say it.

492
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:05,573
I mean--

493
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:07,409
Ahem. Please say it.

494
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:12,038
I'm putting Operation Bartowski
back into the field.

495
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:14,624
- Yes.
- Casey, Sarah...

496
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:18,628
...you will work alongside
Agent Bartowski to bring down The Ring.

497
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:21,131
- That is all.
- Yeah!

498
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,967
This is great.
This is great. Come on, guys.

499
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:27,554
The three of us. The old gang,
back together again. I cannot wait.

500
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,764
What's my new cover gonna be?
I need a job.

501
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:33,560
Can it be something exciting?
Race car driver...?

502
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:35,603
It's gotta be something cool.

503
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,067
Oh, wow.

504
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,820
I can't believe
you got me this job back so quickly.

505
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:47,282
Yeah, well, with no manager, the
paperwork was easy to push through.

506
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,659
So Emmett took a Large Mart job
in Anchorage?

507
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:51,578
- That's the rumor.
- Oh, good for him.

508
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:54,748
Oh, also, thanks for doing me
that extra favor.

509
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:58,585
- What?
- I speak of the bearded one.

510
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:00,420
We're back.

511
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:04,382
- Up high.
- Ugh.

512
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:07,927
There he goes. There he goes.
He's busy.

513
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:09,471
Work, work, work. I got it.

514
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:13,600
Someone from corporate called me
and begged me to take my job back.

515
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:14,934
- Did they?
- I'm serious.

516
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:17,270
I guess they know talent.

517
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,939
They do indeed, my friend.

518
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:25,445
Sarah, I need you to keep
Chuck's emotions in check...

519
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:27,030
...so the Intersect can work.

520
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:30,492
He listens to you,
but he's also an unstable element.

521
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:33,328
- Do you think he's dangerous?
- Very.

522
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:35,288
But he's worth the risk.

523
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:38,458
For the last two years,
we protected Chuck from the world.

524
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:42,879
But now we have to protect the world
from Chuck.

525
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:51,638
Do we need all this stuff?

526
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:54,224
- Oh, hey, guys.
- Hey, Devon.

527
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,683
Hey, El. What's happening?

528
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,103
Well, we're moving.

529
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:02,190
Yeah, the apartment across the
courtyard opened up, so we're taking it.

530
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:06,486
This isn't about you. This is about us.
We needed a place for two.

531
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:10,198
And you can get a roommate, you know?
You have plenty of friends.

532
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:11,991
I'm so happy right now.

533
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,993
Other friends, Chuck.

534
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:16,496
Other friends.

535
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:17,997
Come on.

536
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:19,874
Listen. Listen to me. Two words:

537
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:21,626
Bachelor pad.

538
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:24,671
Yes. I got dibs on Ellie's room.

539
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:29,509
Chuck?

540
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:32,929
We should talk.

541
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:35,056
Absolutely.

542
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:47,402
- I'll go first. I'll go first.
- Sure.

543
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:48,862
Ahem.

544
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:52,407
Sarah, they wanted me to be a spy.
Okay?

545
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:57,871
They told me
that I could make a difference.

546
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:03,209
I've been kicking around, not knowing
what I wanted to do with my life...

547
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:04,461
...like a loser.

548
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:07,213
And then one day,
really important people told me...

549
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:11,050
...that they thought I could change
the world. Me, Chuck Bartowski.

550
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,555
- It was never about you--
- Stop.

551
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:20,894
I acted impulsively.

552
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:23,897
And it's a mistake
I don't usually make.

553
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:26,274
And it won't happen again.

554
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:30,236
- But, Sarah--
- You're a spy now, Chuck.

555
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:35,617
You have to keep your feelings
to yourself.

556
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:44,751
Numbnuts. Ready?

557
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,086
Ready for what?

558
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,839
Your training. Come on.

559
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:57,764
You have much to learn, grasshopper.

560
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:04,771
Flashed yet?

561
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,316
Take a breath.

562
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,281
- Let's do this.
- Oh, yeah.
