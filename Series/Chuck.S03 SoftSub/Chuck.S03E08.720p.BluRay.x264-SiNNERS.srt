1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:04,586
Hi. I'm Chuck.
Here's a few things you need to know.

2
00:00:04,754 --> 00:00:06,588
- Who is that?
- Hot blond? Heart of ice?

3
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:09,133
- That's Chuck's ex, Sarah.
- What's their deal?

4
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:12,261
Turns out
I haven't been completely honest.

5
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:14,680
Truth is, I was hitting on you.

6
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:17,808
It was completely unprofessional,
and I apologize.

7
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:22,604
Oh, my God.
Chuck has a secret girlfriend.

8
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,115
I can't believe that
Chuck is sneaking around my back.

9
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:36,702
Living this other life that he doesn't
think I know anything about.

10
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:39,788
I guess he'll tell you about Hannah
when he's ready, hon.

11
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:43,542
"Hannah." Like you've said it a hundred
times before. So casual. "Hannah."

12
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,295
- Chuck asked me to keep it a secret.
- Maybe it's me.

13
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:49,673
Maybe he thinks, like,
I'll judge him or something.

14
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:53,135
He told me about the first girl
he had a crush on: Mrs. Seaver.

15
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:55,679
- Who?
- The mom from Growing Pains.

16
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,724
You know,
and you used to tell me everything too.

17
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:01,351
And now you and my brother
are thick as thieves.

18
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,479
Is there something
you're keeping from me too?

19
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:04,855
No, nothing. Not a thing.

20
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:08,192
- You're lying.
- I'm not lying.

21
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:10,486
- Your pulse is racing.
- I'm exercising.

22
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,822
Honey, go to Chuck.
Tell him how you feel. Be honest.

23
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:18,160
- That's good advice, honey. I love you.
- Heh.

24
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:22,998
Chuck?

25
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,585
Chuck?

26
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,713
Chuck, listen, uh, I get it.

27
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:35,177
You know, I'm not the one
that you share everything with anymore.

28
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,181
I just-- I just miss being that person.

29
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,310
Everybody knew about this new girl
that you're dating before I did.

30
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,689
I just wanted to let you know
I'm a good secret keeper.

31
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:50,567
And if you don't want Sarah
to know about the new girl...

32
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,404
I won't tell Sarah if you don't.

33
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,533
Um, I'm Hannah.

34
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,246
Oh, my God, this is so embarrassing.

35
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:14,424
Ellie, uh...

36
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:16,260
- My sister.
- Okay.

37
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:18,720
I've been meaning
to introduce you to...

38
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:23,892
...Hannah. Hannah. Who apparently
you've already just met right now.

39
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,729
Uh, Hannah is a girl.

40
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:29,731
She is a girl, and a friend.

41
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:33,235
A very close friend. Technically,
as close as two people can kind of--

42
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,570
- Okay.
- Doughnut?

43
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:35,988
No, thanks.

44
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:40,909
Um, I need to go and get dressed
so I can go to work. It was...

45
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:43,579
Uh, it was really great to meet you, Ellie.

46
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:45,080
- Likewise.
- Okay.

47
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,166
- Bye.
- Bye.

48
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:53,088
I am-- I am so sorry. I just--
I don't know.

49
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:56,675
I felt like I was out of the loop,
and you used to tell me everything--

50
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:58,927
I know. I'm sorry.
You shouldn't be sorry.

51
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:02,764
I wanted to tell you. I've just been
really wrapped up at work and...

52
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,309
But I have an idea.

53
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:08,437
I'm gonna make dinner
for the four of us tonight.

54
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:11,356
And guess what,
it's gonna be your favorite. Oh, yeah.

55
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:14,151
My famous chicken pepperoni.

56
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,945
- Huh?
- Oh, I gotta tell you the truth.

57
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:21,283
I love, ahem, your chicken pepperoni.

58
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,203
Yes, I know this.

59
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:28,332
Really, I'm just-- I'm so glad
that you're moving on from Sarah.

60
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,632
I thought you didn't want dessert.

61
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:39,301
I don't. I want yours.

62
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,804
See, my dessert is contained
within your dessert.

63
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:46,141
- Listen, Shaw.
- I like that.

64
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:50,062
Keep it on a last-name basis.
Personal. Very sexy, Walker.

65
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,815
I don't think we should see each other
in a non-work capacity.

66
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,400
Oh, is that what this is?

67
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:05,202
Look, it's just,
it's becoming a pattern for me...

68
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,537
...to get involved
with the guys that I work with.

69
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,540
And I really need to put a stop to that
before it starts.

70
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,210
So this is a preemptive breakup?

71
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:18,674
I need to stop mixing my personal life
with my professional life.

72
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,680
I'd be a liar
if I didn't say I was disappointed.

73
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,682
But I get it.

74
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:34,022
- Vehicle in question has arrived.
- Roger that.

75
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,244
Man is on the move.

76
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,539
I have the target in sight.

77
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,964
Did you wear cologne in my car?

78
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,384
Nobody wants to smell you.

79
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:07,222
The next time you wear cologne
in my car, I will end you.

80
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:09,808
Night-night.

81
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:24,072
Rafe Gruber is a martial-arts expert,
a sharpshooter.

82
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,909
He is one of five people who can
hit a target from half a mile away.

83
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:29,578
I mean, the man is a chameleon.

84
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,497
It is a miracle
that we even got a hit on his location.

85
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,751
- Very few people have seen his face.
- Big deal. Not impressed.

86
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,296
Well, The Ring is. They wired
a million dollars into his account.

87
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,798
"Enemy of my enemy is my friend"
kind of thing.

88
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,842
We need to know
who The Ring wants dead.

89
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,762
There's nothing this clown can do
that I can't do.

90
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,764
I'm perfect for this mission.

91
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,974
Still,
we're going with Bartowski on this one.

92
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:53,852
He'll assume Rafe's identity
in order to learn The Ring's target.

93
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:57,105
Intersect is performing.
He can do this. He's ready.

94
00:05:57,273 --> 00:06:01,526
- Right, Walker?
- Chuck wants to be a spy.

95
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,445
Well, hello, Team Bartowski.

96
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:12,704
Tempt anyone with a tasty treat?

97
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,122
Huh? Ha-ha-ha.

98
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,625
- What's with him?
- Stallion had a date last night.

99
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,377
Must have gotten lucky.

100
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,712
So, what is going on?

101
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,882
- Who's this guy?
- That is Rafe Gruber.

102
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:36,311
Wow, old Rafey boy
is not such a good guy, now, is he?

103
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,897
- What are we doing with him?
- Not "we," Chuck.

104
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:41,400
- You.
- You're about to assume an alias.

105
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,653
You're gonna become
the world's most dangerous assassin.

106
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:48,323
Becoming an alias is unlike anything
you've had in your spy training before.

107
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:52,202
Under the most stressful conditions,
you react only as Rafe, not Chuck.

108
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,372
Guys, please, I think I know
a thing or two about acting.

109
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:59,084
I played Perchik in my high school's
production of Fiddler on the Roof...

110
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:02,337
...and I was really quite good--
Oh! Ow!

111
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,506
- What'd you do that for?
- Proving a point.

112
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:08,552
Everything you think and feel, even
your innate reflexes, have to change.

113
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:12,180
The people that Gruber associates
will kill first, ask questions later.

114
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,224
Okay, fine, I get it. What's the plan?

115
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:18,520
Casey is going to elicit the details from
Gruber: whom he's meeting and when.

116
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,689
You'll go in as Gruber, take his place.

117
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:24,401
Good luck. It's tough getting information
out of a top assassin like Rafe.

118
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:27,195
No. I can be very persuasive.

119
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,921
- Let me talk to him for a second.
- Step off. I got a job to do.

120
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,381
Yeah, well, so do I, okay?

121
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,926
I gotta learn about Rafe so I can
get into character for my mission.

122
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:54,764
For example, assassin is not normally
a booth one finds at Career Day.

123
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:58,393
- How did you become interested in this?
- Why would I tell you anything?

124
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,604
I can think of one burning reason why.

125
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:04,232
Okay, how about this one?
What was your most difficult hit?

126
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,860
I'll take the torture
over this man's questions.

127
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,446
"I'll take the torture
over this man's questions."

128
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,243
Hey, don't you touch that phone.

129
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,415
Gruber here.

130
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:25,170
Of course I'm ready.
Who do you think you're dealing with?

131
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,506
Yeah. Yeah, I know where that is.

132
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,300
Across the street
from the cupcake place.

133
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:35,931
Because I like cupcakes, that's why.
Who doesn't like a good cupcake?

134
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,099
I'll be there.

135
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:40,435
Not bad, Bartowski.

136
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,646
Who the hell is Bartowski?

137
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:30,902
Look at that guy.

138
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:34,698
Chuck's the greatest lady killer
Burbank has ever seen.

139
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,993
- He's a real Chuck magnet.
- Please, with the puns.

140
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,662
Terrible timing
for my number-one employee, Morgan...

141
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,455
...to be away at a leadership seminar.

142
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:46,251
Due to a clerical oversight, we received
triple the Crock-Pots I intended.

143
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:50,547
- I'm excited about dinner tonight.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, me too.

144
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:54,050
What is that guy's secret with women?
Or has he got some deal with the devil?

145
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:58,888
I've narrowed it down
to either mind-controlling LSD or sorcery.

146
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,266
El Segundo School of Finance
has taught me...

147
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:04,311
...when you're trying to sell a house,
bake some cookies.

148
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,187
Make the place smell familiar.

149
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:09,024
Gonna do the same thing here,
except with gumbo.

150
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,234
Folks smell something cooking
in that Crock-Pot...

151
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,029
...make them wanna buy
the fool thing.

152
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,447
Need a volunteer.

153
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,951
You look like you've peeled
a few spuds in your day, Casey.

154
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,453
Hmm?

155
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:25,582
And I would've picked you if these
two dipsticks hadn't been faking sick.

156
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:29,502
Wash your filthy hands, boys.

157
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:37,010
Hey, uh, I'm cooking dinner tonight
for my family, Hannah.

158
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:40,138
And my special chicken pepperoni recipe
takes a little time to prep.

159
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,016
So I don't know how long the mission is,
but I need a hard-out by 5.

160
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,226
Hmm. I can give you
a hard-out with these five.

161
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,729
Get your priorities straight.

162
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:54,110
- You okay in here?
- Yeah, yeah. I'll be out in a sec.

163
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,786
I see how that guy looks at you.

164
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:11,836
I bet he has no clue what to do
to a beautiful woman like you.

165
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,219
But I do.

166
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:22,097
I will take such good care of you,
sweetheart.

167
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:32,065
- All set.
- Quick thing I gotta do first.

168
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,374
Okay, ready when you are.

169
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,421
Hi.

170
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,218
- I missed those lips.
- What, these old things? Ha, ha.

171
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:03,805
I'm gonna be thinking about last night
when I'm on my install.

172
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,808
- What are you doing today?
- Yeah, same thing, install.

173
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:10,395
Big, huge, complicated, probably
faking my way through most of it.

174
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:13,273
But, hey, how about I come
and, uh, pick you up before dinner?

175
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:14,816
That's great.

176
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,908
Definitely a deal with the devil.

177
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,411
I am so lonely.

178
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,082
Come on.

179
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,754
I can pass for a cold-blooded killer,
right?

180
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,549
What happened to Rafe?

181
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,805
What? Imbecile can't go in alone.

182
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,140
Yeah, where am I going?

183
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:50,477
Chuck, Rafe wasn't going to meet
with your usual spies.

184
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:53,813
These guys
are a little more old-fashioned.

185
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:57,567
Heard a story of this cugine.
Whacked this guy during dinner.

186
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,195
The coroner couldn't tell between
the marinara and the mess. Ha, ha.

187
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,072
Hey, boss, somebody to see you.

188
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:08,328
Well, well, well. Rafe Gruber.

189
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,038
Your reputation precedes you.

190
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:13,750
This is my coworker.
You may call him John.

191
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,127
- Hey, how you doing?
- John doesn't talk much.

192
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,215
- I know you from somewhere?
- Doubt it.

193
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,803
When we had previous dealings
with our mutual friends...

194
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,806
...you had more trepidation
about letting us ID you.

195
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,391
Not many people
have seen my face and lived.

196
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,726
Consider it an honor.

197
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,864
Look, I'm not much for foreplay,
so forgive me if I'm rude.

198
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,992
- Who's my target?
- No one thinks this guy looks familiar?

199
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,079
- You got cousins in Philly?
- Nope.

200
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:55,333
You know, I'm a huge fan of your work.
Can I ask you something?

201
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,460
What was your toughest hit?

202
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:02,006
- You wanna know my toughest hit?
- Look, I was just asking.

203
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,968
- Take it easy, boss.
- You shut your mouth.

204
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,638
You think it's okay to ask a guy
something personal like that?

205
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,349
I really didn't mean no disrespect,
I swear.

206
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:28,491
This guy.

207
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:31,452
Your toughest assignment's
always your next one.

208
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:34,038
You forget that, and you die.

209
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,794
- You okay, Walker?
- Yeah, yeah.

210
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:43,339
It's just this alias thing,
it must be a lot for Chuck.

211
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:44,799
He's not a very good liar.

212
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,302
Listen to him.
He's completely living the lie.

213
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:50,221
I know, but he's not like you and me.

214
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,724
We are both used to living
somebody else's life.

215
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:58,479
- That's the job.
- Yeah, but where does the job end?

216
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,858
I can barely remember
who I am anymore.

217
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,068
I'm a busy guy, so, what's the name?

218
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:07,322
- Who do our friends want me to kill?
- Well, uh, the guy's name is--

219
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:12,201
I remember. You look like this hotshot
sniper I served with a while back.

220
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:15,121
Name Alex Coburn ring a bell?

221
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:28,885
- What are you trying to say?
- Simple. This guy isn't who he says he is.

222
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,511
Maybe he's some kind of fed.

223
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:33,181
Damn it. Casey's been made.
We need to get them out.

224
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,225
How are we supposed to do that
without getting everybody else killed?

225
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:38,937
We need that name
to know who The Ring wants dead.

226
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:42,398
Are you implying that this guy,
my guy, is a cop?

227
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:46,235
That's exactly what I'm saying.
So, what does that say about you?

228
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,160
If he's a cop...

229
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,331
...I'll kill him myself.

230
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,343
Do him, Rafe.

231
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,720
What are you waiting for?
Quit stalling.

232
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,807
Keep stalling. We need more time.
We're waiting for backup.

233
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,059
Time's running out. Kill him.

234
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,484
- I'm not a murderer, I'm an assassin.
- What's the damn difference?

235
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,696
What's the damn difference?
I don't kill because I like it.

236
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:33,574
I kill because it's a means to something.
In this case, information.

237
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:37,161
Information that I wouldn't get
from a dead guy, per your suggestion.

238
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,501
Now, you're gonna tell me.

239
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,712
Who's your informant?
Who's the leak?

240
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:48,589
Hmm. Why would I tell you anything?

241
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,010
- Sell it.
- Wait.

242
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,347
I got something special
for occasions such as these.

243
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,689
Is this stuff sterile?

244
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:07,900
I take pride in my work.

245
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,737
I wanna kill him,
not some secondary infection.

246
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,301
- Ah.
- No.

247
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,471
Tell me what you know.

248
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,493
- Show your hands!
- Nobody move!

249
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,827
Up against the bar, now!

250
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,664
- Behind your back.
- Put them on your head!

251
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:07,585
Oh, my God, Sarah, I'm freaking out.
I've never been so happy to see you.

252
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,671
Stop. You're not you, you're Rafe.
Be him in this situation.

253
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,966
Think what he would do. Live the lie.

254
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,621
- Come on, move. We gotta split up.
- We'll contact you later.

255
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,582
- Rafe, you're incredible.
- Yeah, whatever. It's my job.

256
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:58,719
Good work, team.

257
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:02,932
Wow.

258
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,725
Bartowski really sold it, huh?

259
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:08,104
For a second,
I hardly even recognized him.

260
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:15,736
Guys, I needed a hard-out at 5.
How am I gonna get everything done?

261
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:18,072
I gotta cook dinner.
My apartment's a pigsty.

262
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,741
I gotta pick up Hannah,
take a shower...

263
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,411
- Where is everybody?
- Walker and Shaw knew...

264
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,455
...you were in over your head.
They went to fix dinner for you.

265
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:28,583
- They did, huh?
- Yeah, weird, huh?

266
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,334
Walker helping you get laid.

267
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:34,005
Um, hey, Casey, I'm...

268
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,924
- I'm sorry about your tooth.
- That's all right.

269
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:40,094
At least you got one with a cavity.
Saved me a trip to the dentist.

270
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:43,514
You did good work, Chuck.
Proud of you.

271
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:51,063
- You think you can be me?
- You shut your mouth.

272
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,566
- Where are you taking Rafe?
- Interrogation.

273
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:57,778
- Just wish I could do it myself.
- You think you can be me?

274
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:13,544
Um, Case, back there on the mission,
I flashed on the name Alex Coburn.

275
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:17,882
- Who is that?
- You mind your own damn business.

276
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,897
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

277
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,442
Let's go eat.

278
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,819
I'm not gonna lie to you, boys.

279
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:42,490
- Bartowski is killing it with the ladies.
- I know.

280
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:45,117
First there was that hot girl
from Stanford--

281
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:48,454
Jill. Then the brunette
with the overpriced deli.

282
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:52,667
Lou. She was a fine,
miniature piece of woman.

283
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,502
And now Hannah.

284
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,296
I'd like to moisturize her feet
with my saliva.

285
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,340
Don't you get it?
None of them matter.

286
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,008
Chuck may try to replace her...

287
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:04,345
...but when he's with Sarah,
the light in his eyes shines brightly.

288
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,515
Damn onions.

289
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,696
Oh, knife.

290
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,282
Now, everybody,
keep your expectations low.

291
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:27,326
- I'm not Chef Boyardee.
- Looking forward to hanging out.

292
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,161
I like this one, Chuck.

293
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:37,545
- Oh, my God, Chuck, this looks amazing.
- And smells amazing too.

294
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:40,673
Dude, I thought you worked all day.
How'd you find time to do this?

295
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:45,177
Um, you know, it's a juggling act.
No biggie. I just threw it together.

296
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:48,055
Uh, Devon,
you wanna help me with the wine?

297
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,391
Smells delish.

298
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,977
My taste buds
are fist-pumping each other, bro.

299
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,812
Red okay?

300
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,731
Listen, I didn't do any of this.

301
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:59,317
I didn't buy the cheese.
I didn't make the dinner.

302
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:02,987
- Thank God I can tell you the truth.
- Stop, stop. If you keep talking...

303
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:07,158
...I'm gonna have to lie to your sister.
I can't do that. I'm not cut out for this.

304
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,743
I'm not like you.

305
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,912
I'm sorry. I get it.
If Ellie asks you something, just say:

306
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,706
"I don't know." That's not a lie.

307
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:24,508
I lied. I'm a liar.

308
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:27,845
I have been telling you I love this dish,
and it's been horrible.

309
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:31,599
And now I can tell you honestly
that this is fantastic.

310
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:37,104
Oh, yeah.
I think you're just being polite.

311
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,106
- It's not really my best.
- No, it is.

312
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:41,233
Actually,
the others were quite horrible.

313
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:44,070
Devon,
can you believe that Chuck made this?

314
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:47,114
- I don't know.
- I mean, isn't--?

315
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:48,574
Isn't this chicken moist?

316
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:50,868
Chuck's chicken?

317
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:54,038
- This chicken?
- Chuck's chicken.

318
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:57,875
Um...

319
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,628
Hannah, don't you think
Chuck's chicken is moist?

320
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:03,923
Actually, I, um-- I'd like to make a toast.

321
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:13,349
Um, you know how in life there's always
something that just doesn't line up?

322
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:16,769
Like, um, either you're working
at the wrong job...

323
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:22,650
...or dating the wrong guy,
or you're eating some really bad meal?

324
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:27,488
Uh, but right at this second, I feel like
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be.

325
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:32,284
And I wanna thank all of you
for making me feel that way.

326
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,415
Hope dessert doesn't suck. Ha.

327
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,500
- Um, cheers.
- Cheers.

328
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:56,809
I managed
to sneak us out some chicken.

329
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:59,437
I don't wanna brag,
but it turned out pretty good.

330
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:02,773
Oh, uh, no, thanks. I'm not hungry.

331
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:05,276
I'm clocking out.
Have you got this covered?

332
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,361
Uh, yeah.

333
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:38,100
This is cool. Is this new?

334
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:43,189
Uh, yeah. Yeah, a little perk of the job.
Just testing it out. Work thing.

335
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:48,152
Listen, I, um-- I know this is fast.

336
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,697
But my parents are coming in
from Santa Barbara tonight for dinner.

337
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:54,533
- Oh.
- I wasn't going to ask you to come.

338
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:58,621
But since I got to hang out with
your family, I'd love it if you met mine.

339
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,998
Yeah, yeah,
I would love to meet them.

340
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,667
Bartowski,
I need your professional opinion.

341
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:10,799
Your latest little lady said
that you're some kind of cooking expert.

342
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:13,511
I need your palette's advice.

343
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:16,222
Uh, actually, my recipe last night
didn't really come together.

344
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:21,310
That's not what she said. She said she
couldn't wait to gobble up every bite.

345
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,231
Mouth as pretty as Hannah's?
She can taste the difference.

346
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,816
That's the mouth of a professional.

347
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:37,117
Hello. Burbank Buy More.

348
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,705
The flavor profile's not quite right.

349
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:44,291
I think it could use
Worcestershire sauce, maybe.

350
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:46,126
And, oh, is that frozen okra?

351
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:50,631
Good taste in women,
bad taste in food.

352
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:57,263
Jeffrey, if you double-dip,
we all may die.

353
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,890
- Who was that? What did they want?
- Um, it was a wrong number.

354
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,017
They were asking
for some guy named Rafe.

355
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:05,854
For--? That's odd.
What did you tell him?

356
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:11,652
Um, I told them that this was
a Buy More phone, uh, but the guy just--

357
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,738
He wouldn't listen, and he kept saying
that he would be here in two minutes.

358
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,491
Oh, here.

359
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,911
Hi. Yeah.

360
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:49,231
What do you think you're doing
with that watch?

361
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:51,900
- I can explain.
- There is no explanation.

362
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,694
Give me this watch.

363
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,536
Bad-ass killer to own
such a piece-of-crap watch? Crazy.

364
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:07,082
So we bought you a little present.
Though "bought" is a very loose term.

365
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:12,129
Look at that, gold.

366
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:15,090
- Wow, it's very understated.
- What are you doing at Buy More?

367
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:18,719
- Getting some speaker wire to...?
- What do I look like, a workaholic?

368
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:22,890
A man's gotta have hobbies other than
murder. I was here browsing music.

369
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:25,517
Hey, you saved us
from getting pinched yesterday, huh?

370
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:29,563
- What a guy. Ooh, I could hit you.
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.

371
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:32,316
Never seen anything close
to what you pulled off, Rafe.

372
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:34,276
The trick is making it look easy.

373
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:37,696
You did us a favor,
and in turn, we did you a favor.

374
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:41,241
We tracked down the location
of the guy you're supposed to kill.

375
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:43,744
- Good news, huh?
- Good news?

376
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,123
That is very good news.

377
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:54,630
- Ah. Yeah, enough of that.
- Ah.

378
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:05,766
- Oh, I'm sorry. If this is a bad time--
- Hey, Walker. Come on in.

379
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:12,981
Listen, Shaw, I just wanted to say, uh...

380
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:14,608
What?

381
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:18,987
Well, I-- I came by to, um...

382
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,658
I'm sorry,
can you please put some clothes on?

383
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:25,077
Oh, yeah.

384
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:34,294
I wanted to apologize
for my behavior last night.

385
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:38,132
- No apology necessary.
- Okay.

386
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:42,302
Uh, well...

387
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,680
You still, uh...?

388
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,850
You okay with this whole
Chuck-Hannah thing?

389
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:51,895
Thank you for asking.

390
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:58,569
But that's not really the change
that I'm having trouble with.

391
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:08,370
So who's the mark?
Who am I taking out?

392
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:10,497
He's in the hotel room,
right over there.

393
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:13,292
Got a girl with him.
A real hot piece of tail.

394
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,253
- I think they're gonna plow.
- Perfect distraction.

395
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:19,840
- How am I supposed to see him?
- With this.

396
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,968
- Naturally.
- We hear you're one of five guys...

397
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:25,387
...that can make this shot.
It's over a half a mile away.

398
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:30,350
Well, apparently,
my reputation precedes me, again.

399
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:50,871
- Oh, my God.
- What? What is it?

400
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:57,002
It's just really difficult
to see Chuck become a different person.

401
00:29:57,212 --> 00:30:01,298
- That's the mission, Walker.
- No, it's not the mission, it's everything.

402
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,301
- Talk to us, Rafe.
- It's how he pulled out Casey's tooth...

403
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:07,930
...and how he burnt that asset,
and the way he lies to Hannah.

404
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:11,016
I mean, it's so easy for him.

405
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,436
Chuck's changing.

406
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:21,318
- He's becoming a spy.
- I know, I know.

407
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:24,613
But lives are being affected here.

408
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,283
Sounds like he's not the only one
who's changing.

409
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,912
It's like I'm watching Chuck
disappear...

410
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,456
...and the further he gets
from who he is, the...

411
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:36,625
Take the shot, Rafe.

412
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:40,212
You can talk to me, Sarah. Go on.

413
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:43,715
The more I wanna remember
who I am.

414
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:46,009
Who I was before all of this.

415
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:51,431
Well, if this is you, I like you.
I want more.

416
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:55,811
I've been on this assignment
for almost three years...

417
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:58,230
...and I've never told anybody
my real name.

418
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,731
Not even Chuck?

419
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,359
No, not even Chuck.

420
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:07,197
So, what is it?

421
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:12,953
- What's happening? What's going on?
- Shut up.

422
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:14,997
Feels so weird to say it out loud.

423
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:18,083
- Yeah, you never seemed like a Sarah.
- That's because I'm not.

424
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:20,711
What is it, Rafe?

425
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,088
I'm Sam.

426
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:27,342
My real name is Sam.

427
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:30,512
Sam?

428
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:35,517
Well, I'm gonna kiss you now, Sam.

429
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,333
- Sam?
- Sam?

430
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:02,753
Who's Sam? The guy you're supposed
to whack is Daniel Shaw.

431
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:05,964
The organization that had us
contract you thought Shaw was dead.

432
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:08,550
Turns out, he's just not dead yet.

433
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,844
This is the right guy, all right.

434
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:13,513
So who the hell is Sam?

435
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:17,434
Sam. Sam's the girl.

436
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:22,022
My girl. Sort of.

437
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:27,694
Me and Sam are on-again, off-again,
driving everyone in my life a little crazy.

438
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,448
I hate those
"will they or won't they?" things.

439
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:32,950
Just do it already.

440
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:36,787
If you and this girl love each other
so much, what's keeping you apart?

441
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,914
It's complicated.

442
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,959
- Came down to a question of work.
- What are you gonna do?

443
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:44,461
- You got your priorities straight.
- Right?

444
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:48,590
Plus, she's the one who's pushing me
to be better at my job.

445
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,135
Women. Screwed if you do,
not screwed if you don't.

446
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:57,683
Wait a second, the guy you're
supposed to whack is banging your girl?

447
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:03,105
- It sure seems that way, doesn't it?
- Huh.

448
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:07,067
Jeez, this unlucky guy
is about to get double dead.

449
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,404
Do we have a situation?

450
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:14,116
I tried contacting the agents transporting
Gruber. They're not responding.

451
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:16,034
- They checked in yet?
- No.

452
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:17,869
Damn it.

453
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,248
Get me Bartowski's
last known location.

454
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:22,874
What are you waiting on, Rafe?

455
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:32,884
There. That's better.

456
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:43,812
What's your problem, man?

457
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,689
- Ice him.
- I can't do it.

458
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:51,319
- A bullet's too good for this guy.
- Yeah.

459
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:54,114
You gotta look this jerk in the eye
before you cap him.

460
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:57,367
Yeah, yeah, my thoughts exactly.

461
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:01,830
- I'm going over there. You two stay put.
- Don't worry, Rafe. We got your back.

462
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:04,624
Anything weird goes down,
I'll take out the whole room.

463
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:07,294
I ain't a marksman like you,
but I make sure they're all dead.

464
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:10,505
Yeah, that's real good.

465
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:22,309
Come on.

466
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:30,692
Open the door!

467
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,490
- Unh!
- What's going on?

468
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:38,200
Shut your mouth.
I'll deal with you later.

469
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:42,537
- What's your problem?
- My problem is that nobody messes...

470
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:44,206
...with Rafe Gruber.

471
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,582
They're watching us.

472
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,215
- I'd like you to remove those.
- Oh, no, no.

473
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:55,467
These are the hands
that are gonna kill you, Shaw.

474
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:56,718
What are you doing?

475
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,389
You stole my girl.

476
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:03,683
I'm gonna end you for taking Sam.

477
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:10,398
You had your chance, and you blew it.

478
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,410
Who the hell are you? Aah!

479
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,468
Shaw, enough.

480
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:47,727
Would you stop already?
I'm trying to sell myself as Rafe.

481
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:52,899
They're across the street
with a sniper rifle. They're gonna kill us.

482
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:56,069
No, I'm gonna kill all of you.

483
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,209
Come on, flash.

484
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:20,177
Flash. Come on. Flash.

485
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:37,027
You're coming up here with me.
Come on. That's it.

486
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,279
That's it. Come here. Yeah.

487
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:42,324
- No, please don't.
- Ha-ha-ha.

488
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:44,284
You two got it bad for this blond.

489
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:48,330
Can't say I blame you. So I'm gonna
make it easy on both of you...

490
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:50,415
...take her out of the equation.

491
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:56,796
- No!
- No!

492
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:32,040
Five people in the world
can make this shot, huh?

493
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:34,042
Guess I'm one of them.

494
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:43,593
- Hi.
- Hi.

495
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:45,845
Um...

496
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:49,015
You said that I could come to you
if I ever needed to talk.

497
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:53,645
Yeah, I'm so glad.
Please, start at the beginning.

498
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,524
I feel like I'm living a lie, Ellie.

499
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,695
I used to be able
to compartmentalize these things...

500
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:05,240
...but it's like it's all the time now,
it never stops.

501
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:11,329
I feel like I'm not me anymore.

502
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:17,377
- I think I know what this is about.
- You do?

503
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,879
Maybe things are moving too fast
with Hannah.

504
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:24,342
And even though you really like her,
it feels dishonest...

505
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:27,762
...because the truth is
that you still have feelings for Sarah.

506
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:31,391
Does this sound about right?

507
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,560
See, this is, uh...

508
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:37,397
This is why I don't come talk to you,
Ellie, because you're half a spy.

509
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:40,275
- I'm sorry, Chuck, maybe that's not it.
- No, no, no.

510
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:44,362
What I mean by that
is that you are an excellent half a spy.

511
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:50,076
- Thanks.
- Anytime.

512
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:20,440
Hi.

513
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:23,276
Hi. I'm, uh-- I'm Chuck.

514
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:26,071
Uh, can we talk for a second? Just over...

515
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:29,783
- Uh, yeah.
- Sorry.

516
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:47,008
Are you okay, Chuck?

517
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,469
What's the matter?

518
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:52,806
You know how much I like you, right?

519
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:57,727
What's wrong?

520
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:03,483
Hannah, there are things in my life
that you can't understand.

521
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,736
And I can't explain them to you.

522
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:09,322
I've been dishonest.

523
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,991
And it's not fair to you.

524
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,328
So I have to end this.

525
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:23,128
Because you deserve to be with someone
who you can know completely and...

526
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,801
You-- I, um--

527
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:32,679
- I thought you were a nice guy.
- No, I am a nice guy.

528
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,514
No, you're not a nice guy.

529
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:37,892
We slept together last night,
and now you are dumping me.

530
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:41,896
- No, it's not like that.
- Then how is it? Explain it to me.

531
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:51,698
Look, I have dated a lot of liars before,
so I usually know how to spot them.

532
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,700
But you...

533
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:57,036
You're, like, the best I've ever seen.

534
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,918
I hope that your lies
keep you warm at night.

535
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:32,238
So now that The Ring knows
you're alive...

536
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:36,576
...looks like you're gonna be down here
for a while, so I bought you that.

537
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:40,038
It's a Crock-Pot. They're practically
giving them away at Buy More.

538
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:42,540
And just so you know...

539
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:47,253
...the Castle is outside
of Bamboo Dragon's delivery radius.

540
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:50,548
Thank you, Sam.
