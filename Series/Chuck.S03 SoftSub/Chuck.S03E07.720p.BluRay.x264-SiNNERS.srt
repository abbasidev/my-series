1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:04,169
Hi, I'm Chuck.
A few things you need to know.

2
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:07,423
I just got fired from my job.

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,466
Meeting you almost makes it worth it.

4
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:11,760
If you find yourself without a job...

5
00:00:11,928 --> 00:00:14,805
...my assistant manager owes me
a million and a half favors.

6
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:16,306
Here's the thing. I like her.

7
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:18,642
There's something weird
with Chuck and Devon.

8
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,604
- Like they're keeping this big secret.
- Finally, someone with common sense.

9
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:26,191
- We have to figure out what's going on.
- I got my best men on it.

10
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,012
Perfect.

11
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:40,849
Casey, things are getting
a little hairy in here.

12
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,187
Please tell me the Intersect isn't busy.

13
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,357
Busy? For you?

14
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,025
Never.

15
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,569
- I want you to teach me, Chuck.
- Oh, really, do you?

16
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:56,031
Well, I assume you're referring
to Nerd Herding, but I warn you.

17
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:59,535
The road to computer enlightenment
is a long and treacherous one.

18
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:01,370
Bring it on.

19
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:04,289
Speaking of, how about you bring me
on your next install?

20
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,541
Whoa, easy there.

21
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:08,710
Before you can run, you must
learn to crawl, young grasshopper.

22
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,296
Okay. Well, maybe you prefer
to go with Jeff.

23
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:15,092
Just the two of you crammed
into the tiny hot Nerd Herd mobile?

24
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,885
Well played, newbie.

25
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:19,054
- Next assignment, you ride shotgun.
- Nice.

26
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,060
Excuse me for just one second.

27
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:28,188
I'm in the middle--

28
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,940
- It's Shaw. It's bad.
- Can't it wait?

29
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:34,403
- Not unless you want him to suffocate.
- Suffocate? What are you talking about?

30
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,990
What's up, Hannah?

31
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:41,160
If you need anyone
to show you around the, uh, Buy More--

32
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,954
- Who is that?
Super-hot blond, heart of ice?

33
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,581
Yeah. That's Chuck's ex, Sarah.

34
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,791
Oh. What's their deal?

35
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:51,587
Well, deal is Sarah dumped his ass
and, uh, broke his heart.

36
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,755
Now she can't resist stomping on it.

37
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,132
Look at my boy.

38
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,259
Ah, poor sap.

39
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,512
- Everything all right?
- Yeah. Gotta run. Nerd Herd emergency.

40
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,932
Huh? I didn't get the call.
And, technically, all on-sites...

41
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,268
...should run through
the assistant manager.

42
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,520
- Where are you going?
- You heard the boss.

43
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:09,771
Nerd Herd emergency.

44
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,732
Oh. Carry on.

45
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:13,650
Wait a minute. I'm the boss.

46
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:34,213
- Took you long enough.
- Good to see you too.

47
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,548
You mind telling me
what Shaw's doing?

48
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,467
He's got five minutes of air left.

49
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,136
- What am I doing?
- Getting on the museum's server...

50
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,555
...rebooting the system
and opening the vault.

51
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,808
- They'll never let me on.
- I took the liberty of crashing it.

52
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,477
The only way to stop the alarm.

53
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,939
Unless you get on, there's no way
to open the vault. Get in there.

54
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,901
Oh, you're here.
Thank heavens someone called you.

55
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,071
- Yeah. What seems to be the problem?
- I'm curator of classical art.

56
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,323
I've never even touched one of these
in my life.

57
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:04,159
All I know is the museum
went into full lockdown mode.

58
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,370
It's designed to protect
the collection from fire.

59
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:10,332
But unless you fix it, there's no way
to control the temperature or humidity.

60
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,751
Some of these pieces
are extremely sensitive.

61
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,087
So am I, Chuck.

62
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:18,215
We're in the crawlspace above the vault.

63
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,342
We're trying to get the door open.

64
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,595
Four inches of solid steel.
We could try blowing the hatches.

65
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:26,682
- I'll use C-4.
- No. Shaw's too close. You'll kill him.

66
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,436
It's up to you, Chuck.
You gotta get this door open.

67
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:34,022
Some of these artifacts are
over 3000 years old.

68
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,607
To have survived that long...

69
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,568
...and then to be ruined
by some stupid computer system--

70
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,863
Uh, if you don't mind,
I could really use a little breathing room.

71
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,033
- Oh.
- That's right. Step aside.

72
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:47,369
We are the professionals.

73
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,454
- What are you doing here?
- Surprise.

74
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:53,041
I saw your Nerd Herder parked outside.
You said I could ride shotgun.

75
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,127
So, what's the problem?

76
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:57,838
- Get rid of her.
- Shaw's got less than a minute.

77
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,886
Look, I don't care which of you it is,
but please do something.

78
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,889
Ever restarted a server
from the backup database?

79
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:11,226
- Ah, now you're just insulting me.
- Show me what you got.

80
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:14,896
Run the config script off Server 1.

81
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,067
Validated. Next?

82
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:22,612
Just blow the hatch.

83
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,575
Blow the hatch.

84
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,578
- What about the mask?
- I'm dying.

85
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,122
Roger that.

86
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:39,921
- Fire in the hole.
- No, don't!

87
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:43,967
Don't, computer. Don't do that.

88
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:47,262
I'm just talking to the computer,
because sometimes I feel like it helps.

89
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,182
I need you to reboot on three.

90
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,975
One, two...

91
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,778
Oh, my God, we did it.
We did it. Hey.

92
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,120
We did it. Ha-ha-ha!

93
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,457
Not bad for your first mission.

94
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,918
Splendid work. Absolutely topnotch.

95
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:20,921
- Really. I can't thank you enough.
- Well, hey, anytime.

96
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,340
- All right, how about tomorrow night?
- What?

97
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,301
With the unveiling
of the Mask of Alexander.

98
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:29,971
Everyone in the art world's gonna
be there and I'd like you to be also.

99
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,848
I appreciate the invitation--

100
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:35,060
Heavens, no, I'm not inviting you.
I'm hiring you.

101
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,063
See, I want you there to insure that,
well, there's no more, uh...

102
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:40,065
Uh, what do you call them?

103
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,068
- Bugs.
- Take the job, Chuck.

104
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:47,155
You and your new partner are gonna help
us steal the Mask of Alexander.

105
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:50,200
So, what do you say, partner?

106
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:53,286
It's a date.

107
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,373
- Magnificent.
- Isn't it?

108
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,176
- What is that?
- Double-shot Americano.

109
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:51,303
No cream, no sugar.
Just the way you like it.

110
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,554
Oh.

111
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,431
Almost forgot.

112
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,519
I noticed you like to chew them
when you get nervous.

113
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,399
Hi, gang.

114
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,321
- Hey, hey, hey. What's going on?
- Thanks for joining us, gentlemen.

115
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:13,575
You've guessed the CIA is not interested
in stealing the Mask of Alexander.

116
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,744
We believe this artifact and others...

117
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,371
...are being used to smuggle
items through Customs.

118
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,124
- What sort of items?
- Items of interest to The Ring.

119
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:25,545
This was three months ago
at the National Museum of Damascus.

120
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:28,173
A team broke in
but didn't take anything.

121
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,425
The Ring broke in to hide something
inside the mask?

122
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,470
Traveling exhibitions
don't have to go through screening.

123
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,931
We have to secure the mask
before The Ring does.

124
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,518
Chuck, you'll be in the control room
in case of any snags.

125
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,353
Casey, you'll handle surveillance.

126
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:44,981
Sarah, you and I will pose
as guests at the party.

127
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:52,739
We'll swap the mask before
the unveiling, with this reproduction.

128
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,741
Any questions? Concerns?

129
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:58,078
You mean other than us
bringing a civilian on the mission?

130
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:01,414
- I have new tranq darts to try out.
- No, no, I can handle Hannah.

131
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,750
Besides, she can cover for me
in my Nerd Herd duties...

132
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,877
...if case you guys
need to call in the big guns.

133
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,672
That-- That would be me.

134
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,174
When I say "big guns,"
I'm referring to myself.

135
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:14,553
You know, do I need to flash?
Glad we had this talk.

136
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,396
- Morgan. Ah!
- Hey.

137
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,899
Chuck would freak if he knew
we were meeting like this.

138
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:32,404
Morgan, you told me Jeff and Lester would
get to the bottom of Chuck's secret.

139
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:35,156
I may have overstated
their abilities a bit.

140
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:39,703
What I can tell you is that Chuck
is hardly ever at work...

141
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,289
...always ducking in and out
on weird Nerd Herd calls.

142
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:46,126
Yeah, like his mysterious trip to Paris.
He's been acting weird ever since.

143
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,378
- Right. Wanna know what I think?
- Not really.

144
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,214
- Fine. I think Chuck's protecting us.
- Protect us from what?

145
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:55,719
I don't think he wants us to know
that he's gone to the dark place.

146
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:58,847
- Oh, you don't mean--?
- Yeah. Junior year, when Jill dumped him.

147
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:02,142
He sat in his room and played
"GoldenEye" for three months.

148
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:06,021
- Who knew you could get bedsores?
- This makes total sense.

149
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:09,899
This time Sarah breaks Chuck's heart,
sends Chuck into an emotional tailspin.

150
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,776
Let's not panic. Let's not panic.

151
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,487
- I'll see what I can find out, you know.
- How?

152
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:18,033
I'm assistant manager at the Buy More.
I have my methods.

153
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:19,784
All right, let's see here.

154
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,786
- Phillips screwdriver set?
- Check.

155
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,788
- Dummy artifact?
- Check.

156
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,498
- Harnesses?
- Check.

157
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,418
- And needle-nose pliers?
- Check.

158
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:32,047
- Descender line?
- Check.

159
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:34,299
Fantastic.

160
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:39,554
Well, lock and load.

161
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,891
- You ready, Agent Walker?
- Of course I'm ready.

162
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,728
It's just this is our first mission
in the field...

163
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,731
...so I wanna make sure
that we're both on the same page.

164
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,652
So you ready
for your first mission, Hannah?

165
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:56,988
- Mission?
- Well, I'm just trying to say that...

166
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,491
...you know, you never know
what's gonna happen out there.

167
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,368
Outside the protection of the Buy More.

168
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,745
You and me,
we're going behind enemy lines.

169
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,955
Okay.

170
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:08,291
Let's talk about how many
dates we've been on.

171
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,960
We are playing a couple tonight,
so, what do you think?

172
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:14,130
Uh, one, two, five?

173
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:16,257
Does it really make a difference?

174
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:17,509
It informs our cover.

175
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,719
Our chemistry, body language.

176
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,097
For instance,
have we slept together yet?

177
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:26,434
- Ha, ha. You gotta be kidding me.
- No, it changes the whole dynamic.

178
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:29,646
Well, in that case, no.
We definitely have not slept together.

179
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,066
Good to know.

180
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,127
All right.
Well, uh, make yourselves comfortable.

181
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,879
I trust I shan't be seeing either of
you two again this evening.

182
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,674
The vault is scheduled to open
at precisely 8:00.

183
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,218
The unveiling must go off
without a hitch.

184
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,470
No more bugs, no more crashes,
no more--

185
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,180
No problem.

186
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:05,557
--Problems.

187
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,855
The mask is in this vault.
It opens at 8.

188
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:14,691
Doesn't give us much time
to make the swap.

189
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,819
I thought I made myself clear
about our cover.

190
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,739
Heh. Just because
we haven't slept together...

191
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:24,325
...doesn't mean we have to act
like this is a middle-school dance.

192
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,995
Over there. Behind that door.

193
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:31,458
There's a staircase that leads up
to the top of the vault.

194
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:34,627
Keep an eye out
on the security cameras.

195
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,588
Up to your right...

196
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,590
...and straight ahead.

197
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,885
Are we good, Agent Walker?

198
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,554
Yes, we're fine. Thank you.

199
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,892
Man, it really is impressive.

200
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:52,312
The size of Alexander's empire.
You know what I mean?

201
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,147
Can you keep a secret, Chuck?

202
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,483
Huh? Uh, uh-- Ahem.

203
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,694
Yeah, yeah. It's, uh, kind of my forte.

204
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:03,656
Do you wanna know the real reason
that I took this job?

205
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,534
Um, was it the snazzy outfits?

206
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:09,746
No, it was the barely livable wage.

207
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,122
You.

208
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,919
Uh, me? Really me?

209
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:19,088
It's not like I haven't been
giving you signals.

210
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,341
I hope this isn't too forward.

211
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,178
No. No, forward is good.

212
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,097
In that case...

213
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,701
What did I do?

214
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,955
- Is there something wrong?
- You and your ex-girlfriend...?

215
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,373
Yeah? What, who, Sarah?

216
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,834
Yeah. Morgan said that
you guys were done.

217
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,169
Hundred percent. Dunzo. Why?

218
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:01,464
That is her, right?

219
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,009
Any idea what she's doing here?

220
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,304
Other than making you jealous...

221
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:11,808
...with that ridiculously
good-looking date of hers.

222
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,977
Ridiculously good-- Him? Him?

223
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:16,604
No. Yeah, if you're into the-- Ahem.

224
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:20,024
The strong kind of Superman-y
type of a g--

225
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:31,202
Um, I am gonna be right back.

226
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:42,380
- Chuck, what are you doing here?
- The Ring agent who broke into...

227
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,091
...the museum in Damascus,
Vasillis, is here.

228
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,927
And when I say here,
I mean in the same room here.

229
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:51,806
Look over there.

230
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:56,853
We have to abort.

231
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:01,149
We don't have a choice.
Vasillis and I have history.

232
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,775
Are you sure he remembers you?

233
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,863
You tend to remember the guy
who set your face on fire.

234
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,577
Uh, yeah, it looks like your friend
isn't alone either.

235
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:16,289
They're casing the place,
here to grab the mask.

236
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:19,334
- We'd better move right now.
- I'm not sending you in alone.

237
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:21,252
Hey, it's okay. I'll go with her.

238
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,421
You don't know
what you're dealing with.

239
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:31,262
Get out of here, Shaw.
Unless you wanna blow the cover.

240
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,681
Chuck and I can handle the mask.

241
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:38,311
All right. Casey and I will be
in the van if you need us.

242
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,066
Well, what do you say, partner?

243
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,777
Let's go.

244
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,037
Watch those security cameras.

245
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,873
We have to assume The Ring's tapped
into those as well.

246
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,876
Yeah, I'm one step ahead of you.
Sorry, Hannah.

247
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:07,548
Oh, no. No, no, no.

248
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:16,891
What's that beeping noise?

249
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,978
- What--? Where's your partner?
- Um, he's, uh...

250
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,064
Actually, I don't know.

251
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:26,025
Look, people have traveled from all over
to be here tonight.

252
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:29,362
Now, I don't care what's going on.
Just fix it.

253
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:32,240
You have five minutes
until the grand unveiling.

254
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,742
Now, go.

255
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,916
Okay. You have to lower me
into the vault by hand.

256
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:43,751
Here.

257
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:47,255
So you and Shaw looked like
you were having fun at the party tonight.

258
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:51,342
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I'm just saying, you make a cute couple.

259
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,761
Shaw and I are playing a cover.

260
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,597
Whatever. The guy--

261
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,600
Walker and Bartowski turn off
their mikes?

262
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:03,062
No, I did. Those two gab
like schoolgirls out in field.

263
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,273
- It's murder on the ears.
- That's ridiculous.

264
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:08,276
Ridiculous? He couldn't keep
his hands off of you.

265
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,570
The way he brings you coffee
every morning?

266
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:14,407
Seriously? You don't see--?
You gotta be blind.

267
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:17,285
You're one to talk.

268
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,579
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Oh, nothing.

269
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:23,416
Since Hannah showed up, she hasn't
been able to keep her hands off you.

270
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,960
Cut the girl a break.
You guys are cute together.

271
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,129
Hannah and I are colleagues.

272
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:32,133
Forgive me
for trying to be professional.

273
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:36,971
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize professional
meant having her perfume all over you.

274
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:40,266
Come on. We got a mask to steal.

275
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,268
Sir, we're ready.

276
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:55,490
Vasillis sent his men to the vault.
They have the code.

277
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,825
Walker, you've got company.

278
00:17:58,494 --> 00:17:59,786
Bartowski, you copy?

279
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:02,663
Unh. My hands are kind of full here.

280
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,253
Hi there.

281
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,341
- Aah!
- Chuck!

282
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,393
Hang on, Chuck. I got you.

283
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:34,987
It's five past 8.

284
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:37,865
- Why isn't the vault opening?
- Keep your shirt on. Almost there.

285
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,038
Almost there.

286
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,337
Yes.

287
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,883
Bartowski,
I thought you took care of the vault.

288
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:59,053
It's the girl, Hannah.
She must be using Bartowski's laptop.

289
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,139
- Are we still tapped in remotely?
- Go.

290
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:04,392
- Opening the vault right now.
- Thank you so much.

291
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:15,653
No, no. Why is this happening?
Why is this happening?

292
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,178
Chuck.

293
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,430
- I got it, I got it.
- Chuck.

294
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,945
She broke the connection.

295
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,616
Go, go, go.

296
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,582
- Clear, clear, we're clear.
- Clear.

297
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:19,675
Ta-da.

298
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:32,438
Hey, I'll meet you back at Castle.

299
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:36,442
Give me a few minutes to pack up
and smooth things over with Hannah.

300
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:41,364
Hey, Hannah. Sorry about that.

301
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,992
Where the hell have you been?

302
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,663
How could you abandon me like that
on my first Nerd Herd assignment?

303
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,959
- Forget it. I know where you were.
- You do?

304
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:57,838
Yes. I saw you with your ex-girlfriend.

305
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:02,760
Why would you tell me that things
were over when they're clearly not?

306
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,179
It's not what you think.

307
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:07,765
Okay. Then what is it?

308
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:13,271
Sarah and I have
a very unique relationship.

309
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:17,275
Wow. That sounds really special.

310
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:25,533
I-- I cannot believe that I made such an ass
out of myself kissing you like that.

311
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,994
No. No, you didn't. I'm the ass.

312
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:32,206
Yes, clearly. I think we should just
keep things professional from now on.

313
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,334
No, Hannah, let me make it up to you.

314
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:38,045
Forget it, Chuck. Don't bother.

315
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,048
I'll see you at work.

316
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,802
Weirdo.

317
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:01,986
- Dude, that's like six knocks short.
- I don't know the knock.

318
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,821
- Can I come in?
- Yes, he's asleep.

319
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,742
He didn't get home till God-knows-when
after doing God-knows-what.

320
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,577
I thought he was at work.

321
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,371
Yeah, so did I.
Till I got a pissed-off call from the museum.

322
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:15,583
Chuck bailed on the Nerd Herd
and left his partner behind.

323
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,251
Does that sound familiar?

324
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:20,004
- Great, so we're back to square one.
- Not necessarily.

325
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,131
- I had an epiphany last night.
- What's that?

326
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:25,760
- It's a sudden intuitive realization.
- I know what an epiphany is, Morgan.

327
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:28,095
- I'm asking what epiphany you had.
- Ah. Right.

328
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:31,015
I think we might be going
about this all wrong, okay?

329
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,267
Let's sit Chuck down,
and have an intervention.

330
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:36,520
Force him to be honest.
Only way to get to the bottom of this.

331
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,230
Get to the bottom of what?

332
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,566
Nothing. Probably my breakfast.

333
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:41,942
No. What? Good morning.

334
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:43,527
Hi, morning. Morning, Ellie.

335
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:50,117
Okay, well,
we're gonna be late for work.

336
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:53,120
Oh, look at that. My goodness.

337
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:56,082
- We can't do this now.
- You said intervention.

338
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:59,210
- Cloak and dagger.
- What is wrong with you? Coward.

339
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,304
That's who stole my mask.

340
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,645
Pause it.

341
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:19,480
Who is she?

342
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,109
Oh, he's good.

343
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:25,111
A real Casanova, this one.

344
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,614
He used the blond
to get into the vault...

345
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:32,243
...and seduced the computer girl
to access the security system.

346
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:38,416
It's time to see
how cold-hearted our thief really is.

347
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,298
Tough night at the museum?

348
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:48,968
- Curator called me, gave me an earful.
- Oh, really?

349
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:51,262
- What did he say?
- I don't really know.

350
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,098
I have a hard time making out
British accents, you know.

351
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,350
To me it's just, "Oi, bloody this!"

352
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,103
It kind of reminds me
of Mrs. Doubtfire. Heh.

353
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,522
Which is an awesome flick. Heh.

354
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,691
So, what did happen last night?

355
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,277
Well, you know,
I don't wanna point any fingers.

356
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:08,195
Don't snitch. Code of the streets. Heh.

357
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,657
- What are you talking about?
- Your loyalty to Chuck.

358
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,701
I get it. You wanna protect your boss.

359
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:16,370
But here's the thing.
I'm his boss, is what I'm saying.

360
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:19,373
I don't want you to think of me
as your boss's boss.

361
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,959
Rather as a friend, ultimately,
you know.

362
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,128
And a friend you can tell anything to.

363
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:28,007
And I do mean anything.

364
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,344
Excuse me.

365
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:36,223
- Hello, Nerd Herd.
- I'm calling from the museum.

366
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:39,059
Another doofus with an accent.
Can you believe this?

367
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:40,644
How may I help you?

368
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:44,023
We are still having problems
with our computer system.

369
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:46,066
Perhaps you can send the girl
you sent last night?

370
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:49,862
- Uh, you must mean Hannah?
- Right.

371
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:52,406
- Hannah.
- Oh, absolutely.

372
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,074
She'd be happy to come back out.

373
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:56,535
To make up for the hiccup,
it's on the house.

374
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:59,497
I could send her supervisor along--
But I cannot do that, actually.

375
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:03,250
- Um, he's busy.
- I'm sure she'll be able to handle...

376
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:06,086
- ...the problem herself.
- She will indeed, absolutely.

377
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:07,713
Okay.

378
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:10,758
Thank you, Morgan.
You are a great friend.

379
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,218
That's very sweet of you.

380
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:15,095
And also very poignant...

381
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:18,516
...because I believe that that's
a great place to start, you know.

382
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,434
Then we can build from there.

383
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:22,937
Oh, God.

384
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,609
Morning, Walker.

385
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,361
Okay. We need to talk.

386
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,363
- About last night?
- About everything.

387
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,031
About professional boundaries.

388
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,283
About you bringing me coffee
every morning...

389
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:38,911
...and noticing I like to chew
on my swizzle sticks.

390
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,287
You're embarrassing us both.

391
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:42,790
We are just colleagues
and that is all we'll ever be.

392
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:46,627
So please keep your coffee and
your cheesy come-ons to yourself.

393
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,796
Okay? You got that?

394
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:52,424
Good. Now let's get back to work.

395
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,969
I feel like I should probably apologize
to Colonel Casey.

396
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:57,555
Hey, Shaw.

397
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:01,475
Thanks for the coffee.
Just the way I like it. Black and bitter.

398
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,908
Hello?

399
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,620
Nerd Herd.

400
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,164
Hi. Someone called.

401
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:27,585
Yes. Thank you for coming.

402
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:30,879
- Where's the old curator?
- He's tied up.

403
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,840
I'm the assistant curator.

404
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,133
This way.

405
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:37,428
We've been having problems
with the security system in the vault.

406
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,346
If you don't mind having a look...

407
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:41,599
I really just fix computers.

408
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:44,518
You seem like a smart girl.

409
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,353
You'll figure it out.

410
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:50,983
- Oh. You don't happen to have a phone?
- No, I left it in the car.

411
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:53,193
Don't worry.

412
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,829
Hey. Hey.

413
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:15,549
- Nerd Herd, how can I help you?
- You can bring me my mask.

414
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:18,719
Uh, you have the wrong number, sir.

415
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:23,057
Let me rephrase. Either you bring me
the mask or I kill your girlfriend.

416
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:28,562
Morgan, have, uh--
Have you seen Hannah?

417
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:32,149
Yeah, she's on a call.
Something at the museum.

418
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:41,075
Sir, first of all, uh, I don't have a girlfriend,
just for clarification's sake.

419
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:44,745
Second, like I mentioned earlier,
this is the Nerd Herd desk. So unless--

420
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:45,996
I know who you are.

421
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:50,584
If you want to see the girl alive, you'll
come to the museum, and come alone.

422
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:53,962
She runs out of air in 50 minutes.

423
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,590
Bring me my mask.

424
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,763
Ahem. Hey, buddy. Uh, here we go.

425
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:05,432
- Chuck, I think we need to talk.
- Not a good time.

426
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:10,729
You know what?
I don't care anymore.

427
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,779
Listen, I'm your best friend, dude.

428
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:20,781
At least I used to be, and I deserve--

429
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:24,243
No, I demand to know what the hell's
going on with you lately.

430
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,955
Chuck? You gotta be kidding me.

431
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:31,375
Hmm. Check the base.

432
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,720
- Chuck.
- Sarah. Sarah, I need the mask now.

433
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,638
Vasillis knows and he wants it back.

434
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,640
He grabbed Hannah.
I'm coming down the tunnel.

435
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,311
- That can't be good.
- Uh, Chuck, don't come here.

436
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:53,814
We think the mask is some kind of a--

437
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:00,028
No.

438
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,841
- Oh, no. Guys, guys, it's poison.
- You think?

439
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,135
It's a designer weapon
for battlefield use.

440
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:26,180
The counteragent can be taken
up to an hour after exposure.

441
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:28,015
Or what?

442
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,267
Look, don't worry.
I'm gonna get the counteragent.

443
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:33,854
He wouldn't ship the weapon
without it. It's gotta be back at the--

444
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:44,531
Casey, gear up.
We're heading back to the museum.

445
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:56,794
- This is never gonna work.
- It'll work. Here.

446
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:02,633
Okay. Okay, fine.

447
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:06,345
Let's say we fool Vasillis with
another fake mask and save Hannah.

448
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,889
That doesn't solve
the counteragent problem.

449
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:12,476
What about Sarah and Shaw?
Do we have enough time to save them?

450
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:17,064
Wait, wait, I got it.
I got it, we gas him.

451
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:20,484
That's a great plan,
except the weapon has been deployed.

452
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:23,070
Yeah, but Vasillis doesn't know that.

453
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,325
I've got some smoke grenades
in the back.

454
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:32,371
Funny. I don't feel like I'm dying.

455
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,498
Chuck will come through for us.

456
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,959
In case he doesn't...

457
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,254
...I wanted to clear
the air between us.

458
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:44,341
It turns out
I haven't been completely honest.

459
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:49,763
About, uh, the coffee and how
I was acting at the museum.

460
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,891
Truth is, I was hitting on you.

461
00:30:56,521 --> 00:31:00,607
It was completely unprofessional
and I apologize.

462
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:06,613
I owe you an apology as well.
I overreacted.

463
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:16,415
The way you touched my neck
at the party...

464
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,084
...I guess it was kind of nice.

465
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,754
Really?

466
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,923
Really.

467
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,927
Well, then, I'm glad we had this talk.

468
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:33,307
Yeah. Me too.

469
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:40,981
Poison's been contained.
Room's been cleared.

470
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:45,277
You need that antidote soon.
We gotta get you out of here.

471
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:53,577
All right. All right.

472
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:03,337
Stop there.

473
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:06,006
Show me my mask.

474
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:14,598
Show me my Nerd Herder.

475
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:15,849
She's in the vault.

476
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,809
Oh, look at the time.

477
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,853
Air must be getting a little thin.

478
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:28,111
I'll blow the vault.
I can't promise she'll be okay.

479
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:32,157
- I did what you asked. Let her out.
- If it were up to me, sure.

480
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:33,450
She would walk free.

481
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:37,621
But the people you've stolen from,
The Ring?

482
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,373
They're not so forgiving.

483
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,626
Do what you want to me.
But the girl had nothing to do with this.

484
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,670
You're in no position
to make demands.

485
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:48,215
You gave up any leverage
you might have had...

486
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:50,634
...when you walked in with the mask.

487
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:52,386
Not quite.

488
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,222
We all know what's inside this mask.

489
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:59,601
So either you open that door
and let her out or I release the gas.

490
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:01,687
I don't believe you.

491
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,856
Well, that's too bad. You should've.

492
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:13,865
- You've killed us all, you idiot.
- There's a counteragent, right?

493
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:15,909
- Where is it?
- It's in a vase.

494
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,537
There's hundreds of them. Which one?

495
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:20,080
How am I supposed to know?

496
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:23,375
- I wasn't going to steal it personally.
- Oh, I see, I'm the idiot?

497
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:31,258
Come on, Chuck. One of these
things is not like the others.

498
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,292
- Time's up, Chuck.
- No, Casey, wait.

499
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,211
I found the counteragent.
Meet me in the control room.

500
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:11,048
When do I get to blow something up?

501
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,721
Casey, here.
How much time they got left?

502
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:21,224
Don't worry about that.
You get her out of the vault.

503
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:24,144
- You don't have enough time, do you?
- Focus, Bartowski.

504
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:29,232
Even if they are lost, we still have
a civilian in there. Get her out of there.

505
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,503
Come on, come on. Yes!

506
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:02,182
Hey, Sarah, Shaw.
Here's the counteragent.

507
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:04,851
I'm gonna go release the curator.

508
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:17,114
- You okay?
- Yeah.

509
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:19,199
Yeah, thank you.

510
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:35,215
Hannah. Hannah.

511
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,633
Hannah. Hannah.

512
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,468
- What happened?
- You were--

513
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:43,306
You passed out and I think, uh, somehow,
you got trapped in the vault.

514
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:45,058
Oh, my God.

515
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,977
I could have died in here.

516
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,023
You saved my life, Chuck.

517
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,316
Well, I don't--

518
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,402
Oh, hey.

519
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:59,656
Hey. Hey.

520
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:04,077
- I know I acted weird the other night.
- Forget it.

521
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:29,895
Nice work, everyone.

522
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:31,730
And you. I owe you one, Bartowski.

523
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:34,941
Oh, come on.
Just because I saved your life. Twice.

524
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:37,736
Don't mention it.

525
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,488
It wasn't just my life.

526
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:43,450
Yeah. You also helped secure
a rogue chemical weapon.

527
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:48,288
Guys, look, I appreciate a ticker-tape
parade just like the next guy.

528
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,457
But come on, I got a great team.

529
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,960
And that brings us
to our next point of business.

530
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:57,130
Well, uh, Chuck,
you're not going to have us forever.

531
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:59,174
The Intersect
was originally designed...

532
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:02,302
...so that agents could work
autonomously.

533
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:04,137
We're your training wheels.

534
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:08,433
And your performance tells me
that it's about time for us to come off.

535
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:11,895
Hope you're ready for
your big-boy bike, Bartowski.

536
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:15,398
Huh.

537
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:22,739
Hey.

538
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,992
Uh, I just wanted to make sure
you were okay.

539
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:29,371
Yeah. I guess I've gotten used
to us being a team, you know.

540
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:32,958
Well, we're not going anywhere yet.
But Shaw's right.

541
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:35,961
At some point, I'm just gonna be
standing in your way.

542
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,421
And not just professionally.

543
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,924
Right.

544
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:43,969
Sure you're okay
with the Hannah thing?

545
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:47,055
Oh, I shouldn't have
given you a hard time.

546
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:49,474
She's great, and...

547
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:52,227
How do you think I feel
about you and Shaw?

548
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:55,188
I mean, you two are perfect together.

549
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,524
- It's disgusting.
- Oh.

550
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:01,069
In a heartwarming kind of way.

551
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:07,575
All I know is the guy carried you
out of Castle on his back...

552
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:09,828
...while you were both dying.

553
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:14,749
So if I have to see you with someone else,
it might as well be a hero, right?

554
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:18,128
What can I say? I have a type.

555
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:27,721
I'll see you, Sarah.

556
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:29,472
Bye, Chuck.

557
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,119
- Well done on the knock.
- Really?

558
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:52,412
Yeah.

559
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,956
- Is Chuck here?
- Slinking around somewhere, yeah.

560
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:58,001
- Uh, you ready to do this?
- Time for an intervention.

561
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,924
What is Chuck doing here so late?

562
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:07,427
This is exactly the behavior
I was talking about.

563
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:10,388
Your brother,
he is into something weird here.

564
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,391
No, no, we shouldn't--

565
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:15,977
We can't, I'm scared.

566
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:18,772
Listen to me.
Whatever is going on behind that door...

567
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:20,940
...we need to know about, okay?

568
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,609
This is for Chuck.

569
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:25,612
Phew. For Chuck. You go.

570
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,906
- You go.
- Okay, I'll go.

571
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,458
Oh, my...

572
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,965
Oh, my God.

573
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,967
Chuck has a secret girlfriend.

574
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:50,136
This means
he's moving on with his life...

575
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:53,139
...and he's not wallowing in self-pity
and playing video games.

576
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:55,767
- It's just such a relief.
- Phew.

577
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:59,062
Such a relief. Man.

578
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:14,786
Okay, I'm gonna head out.
You two coming?

579
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,664
Uh, no. I'm gonna finish up in here.

580
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:20,583
Yeah. I'm pretty buried too, so...

581
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,253
Ah.

582
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:39,454
We both know how dangerous this is.

583
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:42,916
Relax, Sarah.

584
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,877
I'm the safest guy in the world.

585
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,434
Are you sure it was him?

586
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:04,437
I'd never mistake Daniel Shaw.

587
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,484
What are you going to do to him?

588
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,779
Same thing I'm going to do to you.
