1
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:23,814
Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it.

2
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,774
Don't you see?
This is what they want.

3
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:29,486
- I gave you a chance.
- Please. I had no choice.

4
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,548
Don't!

5
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:51,467
Oh!

6
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,398
Stop it. Stop. Please. Please.

7
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,567
Jeffrey.

8
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,195
There's so much more
that I wanna do.

9
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:12,738
To feel.

10
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,908
Ah! You're loathsome.

11
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:20,079
Just about enough
of you two morons.

12
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,915
You knocked over a customer. You.

13
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,417
Fat, drunk and stupid.

14
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:28,253
Together you constitute
a clear and present danger...

15
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:29,922
...who needs to be neutralized.

16
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,217
You know, John,
I know you like to play make-believe...

17
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:35,344
...that you're
some military tough guy...

18
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,971
...but the truth
is that you're just a schmuck...

19
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:40,974
...that works in an electronics store.

20
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:42,559
With us.

21
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:45,896
I guess you didn't hear that Big Mike
sent Morgan to El Segundo...

22
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,190
...for a management seminar
for three days...

23
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,526
...leaving me in charge
as assistant manager.

24
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:53,862
What a special moment for you.
I assume you've been made aware...

25
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,698
...of the "No Touching" policy
here at the store.

26
00:01:56,866 --> 00:02:00,494
Granted, it's mostly for Jeff,
but it holds company-wide, friend.

27
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:03,914
Don't you see?
Johnny, you can't harm us...

28
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:07,376
...thanks to the rules
of the very corporate system...

29
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,128
...that you so admire.

30
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:12,131
Ha! The irony.

31
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,676
- I love irony.
- Well.

32
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:20,806
Casey, what did you just do?

33
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,933
What are you doing here?
You clocked out.

34
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,060
I did, but I thought
I'd take a second...

35
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:28,147
...to see how you were adjusting.
Apparently, not great.

36
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:31,608
- Baby steps.
- More like baby kicks to the groin.

37
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:33,110
We gotta get you reinstated.

38
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:36,822
Without a license to kill, you are
a menace to society. Listen. Listen.

39
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,784
I'm gonna talk to Beckman. If she
doesn't give your job back, I'm quitting.

40
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,786
- Ridiculous.
- That's not ridiculous.

41
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,621
I'm gonna ask Sarah to do the same.

42
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:47,583
If she calls me back.
You know she went to D.C. with Shaw?

43
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,460
- Talk about a weekend in Snoresville.
- Listen up, Chuck.

44
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:53,547
I disobeyed orders. I put my team
and my country in danger.

45
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:56,967
This is my job now.
I made my bunk and I'll lie in it.

46
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,636
Unlike you,
I know when something's over.

47
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:04,141
John Casey, my office. Now.

48
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:08,604
Look, you were put in an impossible
position, okay? You had no choice.

49
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,231
It's America, Chuck.
Everyone has a choice.

50
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:14,067
Casey!

51
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,446
You have to choose, John.

52
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:20,824
Do you see yourself working
at Buy More for the long haul?

53
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,077
I don't have a better plan.

54
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:26,246
You've got to stop coming in
so damn hot.

55
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:29,249
Can't be laying hands on people.
Not even Jeff and Lester.

56
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,001
- He's not a man.
- He's an animal.

57
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:34,338
Like Jeff, but undulled by drink or drug.
Dangerous because of it.

58
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:37,216
We demand justice.
Or at least a humiliating apology.

59
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,218
- Or we're gonna sue.
- Mm.

60
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,469
Who are we gonna sue again?

61
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,930
Everybody.
The store, Mr. John Q. Crazy.

62
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:44,806
Chuck and Morgan. You see...

63
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:48,727
...being the accused in a number
of civil and criminal proceedings...

64
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:52,189
...has left us extremely litigious.

65
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,570
No, no, no. Good.

66
00:03:58,738 --> 00:03:59,947
Good. That's it.

67
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:02,866
You are hearing from my attorney,
who, by the by, is my cousin.

68
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:06,161
Who, by the by,
likes me very, very much.

69
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,754
- What?
- This is serious.

70
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:20,008
Those boys aren't fooling about this.
Now, I like you.

71
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:23,512
And I know you're physically strong,
but what I need to know...

72
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,264
...is are you mentally strong?

73
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:31,228
Strong enough to bend like the reed
and not snap like the Kit Kat.

74
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,522
To be John Casey, not John Crazy.

75
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,857
Conking people.
Walking around conking heads.

76
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,777
You can't be conking heads
in Buy More. It's Buy More.

77
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,914
- Hey, Sarah.
- Hi.

78
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,333
Hi.

79
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:57,963
How was D.C.?
I'm assuming you guys had a lot of fun.

80
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:01,717
Although I can't really picture
what Shaw does for fun.

81
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,844
Uh, I'm sorry I didn't you call back...

82
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:07,723
...but it was a work trip
and we were in a lot of meetings.

83
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,935
Talking about you, actually.
About your future.

84
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:15,856
My future? No, no, no. It's Casey's
future we need to be concerned with.

85
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,566
We gotta get him reinstated.

86
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,110
I'd like nothing more
than to get him reinstated.

87
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,446
Casey's status
is none of your concern.

88
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:26,616
There is business to attend to, however,
which very much concerns you.

89
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:29,578
You left your bag in the car
on the way back from the airport.

90
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,413
- Oh.
- So thoughtful.

91
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:32,956
Good morning, team.

92
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:35,125
Have you told him anything yet?

93
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,712
- Told me what?
- It has been decided...

94
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,173
...you are ready for a mission
that will test...

95
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:45,427
...everything you have learned thus far.
A final spy test, if you will.

96
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,430
Oh. A test? Yeah. No problem.

97
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:51,099
I'm a whiz with a number two pencil.
Scantron.

98
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:55,687
If you fail to complete the mission
then you'll go back to your old life.

99
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,440
But if you succeed, you will be promoted.

100
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:03,362
No more Buy More, no more handlers.
Just real missions for a real spy.

101
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,988
You will be based out of Rome.

102
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:08,408
Your cover will be that
of a billionaire industrialist.

103
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,035
Serious? Seriously?

104
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:16,375
I love it! Fantastic!
We're gonna have to brush up...

105
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,210
...on our Italiano, you know?

106
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,045
No, Chuck. Just you.

107
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,631
Agents Walker and Shaw
will be based in D.C...

108
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,217
...and continue to head
counter-Ring operations.

109
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,470
- You will deploy before them.
- D.C.?

110
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,515
Ahem. D.C.

111
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:33,725
Not-- Not Rome.

112
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,061
You will get
your mission specifics tomorrow.

113
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,979
Your spy test will start then.

114
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,773
Good luck.

115
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,485
You can do this, Chuck.
You can pass this test.

116
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,821
It's everything
you've been working toward.

117
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:52,160
Me, a real spy.

118
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:53,954
In Rome, no less.

119
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:55,997
Congratulations, Chuck.

120
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:00,836
It looks like you're gonna get everything
that you always wanted.

121
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:53,430
- Morning, Chuck.
- Aah! Good-- What--?

122
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:57,767
Hi. How long have you been here?

123
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:01,521
Or are you really here? I--

124
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:05,317
I could be asleep right now.
I very well could be asleep right now.

125
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,653
I have some of the most
vivid dreams sometimes--

126
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,865
Chuck, you're awake. Please sit down.
Your mission has started.

127
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:16,369
This is how a real agent gets missions
in the field.

128
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,248
You surprising them in the kitchen?
That must involve travel.

129
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,251
Focus. From here on in,
my role is to observe and report.

130
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:25,045
More of a proctor than a partner.

131
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:30,759
What's this thing?

132
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,177
Ah!

133
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,598
What are you doing?
You writing something?

134
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,517
Are you writing about me? Grading?

135
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,686
Think of it more like recording
the experience for history.

136
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,522
Sure.

137
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:47,067
Good morning, Chuck.
Your mission centers around this man.

138
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:50,153
Anatoli Zevlovski,
a Russian FSB agent.

139
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:53,573
He is in Los Angeles to meet
with a person we believe works for us.

140
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:56,076
- Who? Who us, general?
- It's a recording, Chuck.

141
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,203
- What's that?
- A mole within the CIA...

142
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,873
...has been selling secrets to Anatoli
who then sells them to The Ring.

143
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,875
This mole is responsible
for the deaths...

144
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,753
...of hundreds of civilians
and nine of our agents.

145
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:09,965
We have intel that Anatoli
is meeting with him, or her...

146
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,384
...at the Cobalt Hotel and Spa tonight.

147
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,762
Your mission is to ascertain
the identity of the mole.

148
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:20,433
You will stake out the hotel's entrance
and let Anatoli lead you to the mole.

149
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:23,103
Wait. That's all I need to know?
How can that be all?

150
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,855
Is there a rewind on this thing?
What's the deal? Come on.

151
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:31,861
Wow. That really self-destructed, did it not?
That's like in the movies. Incredible.

152
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,948
Well, I got it, anyway.
Take out Anatoli and find the mole.

153
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,366
Done and done.

154
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,662
Still with the writing. What is this?

155
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,331
The CIA's permanent record?
This is like junior high.

156
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:44,749
Pretty much.

157
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:50,005
Really? So you're saying
that's got all the greatest hits in it, huh?

158
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:54,050
All the daring escapes
and last-second bomb defusions...

159
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:58,013
...and I would hope,
all of the world-class stakeout mixes.

160
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:02,767
Yeah. Everything is in here.

161
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,978
We've definitely been through a lot.

162
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,983
I mean, not just us. Casey, as well.

163
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,193
Yeah. Casey, as well. Right.

164
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:15,155
Hey, speaking of stakeouts...

165
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,574
...you're gonna be
at the stakeout tonight?

166
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,076
Right. Shaw will quarterback
from the Castle.

167
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:25,540
But-- So this is, like,
our last mission together?

168
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,834
Seems like
we should do something special.

169
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:30,295
Special will be you
completing your mission...

170
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,880
...and becoming a spy, Chuck.

171
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,382
Of course. Of course.

172
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,719
I'm just saying, last mission.

173
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,095
Kind of makes you think.

174
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,348
Old times.

175
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:42,807
Good times.

176
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,352
Dangerous but good.

177
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,937
Yeah, it does.

178
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,482
I'll see you tonight.

179
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,651
See you tonight.

180
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,032
Chin up, please.

181
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:03,787
- This is Clarence, my tailor.
- Hi.

182
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,080
What's this about?

183
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:07,165
Well, this is about--
Mm.

184
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,000
You looking good, Mike.

185
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,628
- You losing weight?
- Thank you, Clarence. I have.

186
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,214
I ask again. Why am I here?

187
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,216
You're here
because I wanna help you...

188
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,927
...try to smooth out
some of those jagged edges.

189
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:22,263
- With a little help from Clarence here.
Mm-hm.

190
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,057
Jagged's good. I like jagged.

191
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,309
You also like to be
an employed person too?

192
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,353
One without a lawsuit
slapped on him?

193
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:34,609
Now, I've talked to Jeff and Lester,
told them that I could get you to change.

194
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,821
And that change starts right now.

195
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:40,031
Get on the box.

196
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,784
You don't seriously think
new clothes...

197
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,245
...are gonna somehow
make me less me, do you?

198
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:48,248
Look. What I do know
is that to get your head right...

199
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,458
...you gotta get your threads right.

200
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:54,212
Now get on the box and let Clarence
put some new feathers on you.

201
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,925
Hey, Chuck.

202
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:45,221
Everything looks good. It doesn't seem
like you've missed a trick.

203
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:48,767
Yeah. Thanks.
There is one more thing, though.

204
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,693
Ta-da! Heh, heh.

205
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,739
No one throws a stakeout
like Chuck Bartowski.

206
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:06,201
You can put that in my secret file.

207
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,786
A little bubbly for you.

208
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,582
And a little bubbly for me.

209
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,169
So tell me, do the words
sizzling shrimp ring a bell?

210
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,421
From our very first stakeout.

211
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:19,923
- That's right.
- How could I forget?

212
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:32,227
I see you, you see me

213
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,437
Also from our first stakeout.

214
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:35,772
And yet, timeless.

215
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:41,277
You're gonna miss me in D.C.
You know that, right?

216
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,364
I know.

217
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,537
So, um...

218
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:57,126
So you and Shaw,
are you gonna be living together?

219
00:13:57,294 --> 00:14:01,422
Is that it?
Like, are you guys real serious, or what?

220
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:06,177
Uh, I don't know. It's-- It's different.

221
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:10,056
- Different how?
- Than with you.

222
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,851
You know, I'm-- I'm--

223
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,816
It's Shaw.

224
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,819
- Yeah, hello?
- Is there a problem?

225
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,946
No. No. There's no problem here.

226
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,115
Why? Can I talk to you
after the mission?

227
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:30,743
You should have your earpiece
in already. Is Sarah there?

228
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:33,538
Yes. She just got here.
What a coincidence.

229
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,999
Thanks for the reminder
about the earpieces.

230
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,334
Anatoli and the mole
could arrive any minute.

231
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:39,544
Stay on the ball.

232
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,839
- It's all you out there.
- Okay. Talk to you soon. Bye.

233
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,228
What I was gonna ask you
a minute ago...

234
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:00,189
...or what I was about to say,
anyway...

235
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,109
...was that I've been--

236
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:06,362
I'm thinking about
what it used to be like between us.

237
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,655
Before Prague.

238
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:12,118
And thinking about
what life would be like for us...

239
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:15,705
...if we'd made different decisions
back then.

240
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,460
If I'd made a different decision
back then.

241
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:27,508
We couldn't be together before
because I wasn't a spy...

242
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,844
...but if I pass
we wouldn't have to choose...

243
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:33,431
...between the job and us.

244
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:36,142
If I pass this test,
we could be together.

245
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:42,148
That is, of course,
if you're willing to give it another shot.

246
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,536
Did you see him? Did you flash?

247
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:58,122
No, I-- No, I didn't. Should I have?

248
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,209
Anatoli's in the hotel.
He swiped a card he uses at the spa.

249
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,002
- How did you miss him?
- I don't know.

250
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:06,673
- I'm going after him.
- What? Sarah, give him the glasses.

251
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,843
Wait. Here. Put these on.
Record everything and relay it back.

252
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:14,305
Okay, Sarah, get back to Castle.
You're on your own, Chuck.

253
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:18,226
Now get in there before the mission
and your spy career are over.

254
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:20,645
This isn't over.

255
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,336
Sir.

256
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:48,423
Can I help you? Do you have
an appointment for a treatment?

257
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,299
No. No. Not an appointment per se.

258
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:53,928
I made plans with a friend of mine,
a Russian fellow, to meet here.

259
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:58,016
We really enjoy spaing together, so...

260
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,435
Yes, I think he and his party
just checked in.

261
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,311
The day use fee is $100.

262
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:05,440
- Not including treatments.
- Hundred dollars? Heh, heh.

263
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,442
Let me just...

264
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,278
- I can expense this, right?
- Pay it, Chuck.

265
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:11,946
Right.

266
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:16,617
I just gotta break out the old plastic.

267
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,127
Just checked the locker room.
Nobody's here.

268
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,129
Check the steam room.

269
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,632
What? Uh-- Uh--
Excuse me, inside a steam room?

270
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,261
- Is that really hygienic?
- You can tell me when you come out.

271
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,905
Wow, it's really steamy in here.

272
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,407
Sit tight.
The steam will clear up in a minute.

273
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,998
- What happened?
- It wasn't his fault.

274
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:08,336
You've been in the field.
Operations don't always go as planned.

275
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,757
Oh, well. Hi, there.

276
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,093
Looks like I'm not alone after all.
Nope.

277
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:20,306
Just three other people in here
with me. How fun.

278
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:25,061
It's just Anatoli and his muscle. He must
not have made contact with the mole.

279
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,188
Stay with him.

280
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,193
- Mr. Drago? Mr. Ivan Drago?
- Yes?

281
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,528
Ivan Drago? Seriously?

282
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,369
He's paranoid.
Believes we're being followed.

283
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:44,205
Wants to meet upstairs in the room.
Let's go.

284
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:58,553
Hey. Why so quick to pick up trash
on floor?

285
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,102
Chuck, get out of there.

286
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,979
Just doing my part, keeping it green.

287
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:33,421
You have to get to the mole
before he leaves. Get moving.

288
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,591
- Locker's to your left, sir.
- Thanks.

289
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,034
Anatoli's on the seventh floor.
He's meeting the mole.

290
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,620
Nice work, Chuck.
Priority is ID'ing the mole.

291
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,121
But do not blow your cover.

292
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,457
- He can't know we're on to him.
- Got it.

293
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,510
Ahh. Good shower time.
I think I got my watch wet...

294
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:23,137
...so I'm gonna dry it off.

295
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,307
Sorry, I forgot to put
the "Privacy Please" sign up.

296
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,860
- Oh, my God.
- Come on, Chuck, you can do this.

297
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,915
This would have been easier in underpants.

298
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,669
Well done. You are about
to become an even richer man.

299
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,213
We should begin
the process of retrieval.

300
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,841
Change of plans, Anatoli.

301
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:06,681
I'm dealing directly with The Ring now.
Your services are no longer needed.

302
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:22,029
Oh, God. Oh, God.
The mole just killed Anatoli.

303
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:25,866
Forget Anatoli. The mole's leaving.
You gotta get a look at his face.

304
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,771
We've got it, Chuck.

305
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:57,315
Congratulations.

306
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,610
Ahh.

307
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,613
I am a spy.

308
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,617
Oh, no.

309
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,955
I am a naked spy.

310
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:29,597
- Looking good, John.
- I'm feeling pretty good.

311
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,849
That Clarence can work wonders.

312
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,602
- Are we here for a light lunch?
- Yes and no.

313
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:36,937
I got Jeff and Lester to agree
to a deal.

314
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,692
If you can sit down with them
and apologize...

315
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,195
...if you show
John Crazy's been put on ice...

316
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:47,114
...they'll drop this lawsuit thing.
So the question is:

317
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:50,409
You look cool, can you be cool?

318
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,377
Lester, Jeff...

319
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:06,467
...I would like to apologize
for roughing you guys up earlier.

320
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,302
- It's just I--
Sorry, Jonathan...

321
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,721
...but sweet, sweet,
sweet Lisa here...

322
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,224
...would like some payment
for these sandwiches.

323
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:17,561
- But I didn't order them.
- No. I did.

324
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:24,402
Oh, my God. Is that tuna and pepperoni?

325
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:27,571
Yes, it is. The tuna-roni. It's superb.

326
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:31,450
You see, Johnny boy,
I need to know that you understand...

327
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:34,286
...that apologies
are about more than just words.

328
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:38,499
Often, they're about money.
And in this case, yours.

329
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,425
Keep the change, sister.

330
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:50,928
Lester, you're pushing it.
The man apologized. Now let it go.

331
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,806
What assurances do I have
that such civilized behavior...

332
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:59,103
...is gonna continue when we
and this monster are alone together?

333
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,273
- Oh, God.
- It's good.

334
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,025
- Yummy.
- Lester, I promise...

335
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:07,027
...I won't bang you around anymore.

336
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:08,863
Okay, Lester. So everything's cool.

337
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:12,032
- No more lawsuit.
- Yeah, we're cool.

338
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,537
If we seal our newfound understanding
in that time-tested way.

339
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:19,623
By breaking freshly-baked
bread together. Right?

340
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,293
I think that's-- Jefferson?

341
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,464
Mind you,
there's literally no way of knowing...

342
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,382
...where this guy's mouth has been.

343
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,302
Fire hydrants. Diseased animals.
Puppets.

344
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,767
Very civilized.

345
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:41,061
Oh, no. Oh, John.

346
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,489
Hey there, colleague.

347
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,365
Peer. Heh, heh.

348
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:58,662
Tell me, when I should expect to receive
my international spy union card, huh?

349
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,248
You did a great job last night.
Congratulations.

350
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:03,751
Thank you. I appreciate that.

351
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,087
So tell me, and this is
just between the two of us...

352
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:10,674
...just for the sake of conversation,
but as far as these tests go...

353
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:14,762
...do other people do as well as I did?
Or did I do, like, historically well?

354
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:19,600
Listen, Chuck, I was hoping that
you would be free for dinner tonight.

355
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,186
Yeah.

356
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,021
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

357
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:27,066
In fact, I was actually gonna ask you
if you were free.

358
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:31,737
So how about Traxx?
It's a restaurant down at Union Station.

359
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:34,865
Uhh, yeah. Yeah. That sounds great.

360
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:38,410
Nothing wets the whistle
like the sound of a nice long horn.

361
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:41,872
Forget it. I'm very excited.

362
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,792
- Well, don't be too excited.
- Let me finish.

363
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,336
By excited, I mean...

364
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:48,837
...cold as ice...

365
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:51,298
...because, you know,
now I am a real spy.

366
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:00,933
You made me proud.

367
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:04,645
You were right. Feels good
not to be so wound up all the time.

368
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:08,482
What'd I tell you? Subway can soothe
the tummy and the soul.

369
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,318
Did somebody say something about
soothed tummies and souls?

370
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,571
I did, and I'm happy to say...

371
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,824
...we've got ourselves
a changed man, Chuck.

372
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,787
Well, I guess that makes
two changed men.

373
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,122
- What? You?
- Yeah.

374
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:27,960
Buddy, I just passed
my first solo spy test last night.

375
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,253
I'm going to the show.

376
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:33,799
I really wanted to tell you beforehand,
but top secret, you understand.

377
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,467
You took your test last night?

378
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:37,177
- And you passed?
- Oh, yeah.

379
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:39,597
With flying colors, man.

380
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:42,474
And I think we both know
I have you to thank for that.

381
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:46,020
So I wanted to give you
a little something.

382
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:47,646
Yeah.

383
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:51,191
I don't think they're gonna miss it
down in Castle, do you?

384
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:59,450
You know that giving a government-issued
firearm is a felony, don't you?

385
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:01,869
But it was a thoughtful felony.

386
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:05,706
Honestly, everything is coming up roses
right now. I passed my test.

387
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,834
You are joining the world
of human beings, so proud of you.

388
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:13,005
Kudos for that. And Sarah
has invited me to dinner tonight.

389
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:16,967
Alone, at Union Station, so...

390
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,386
Hey, you sure
you've completed your test?

391
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,722
Yeah. Yeah, like I said, I passed.

392
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,223
Celebration time now.

393
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:27,102
Hmm.
Okay, you just be careful out there.

394
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:29,563
Ready for anything.

395
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:32,107
A good spy always is, right?

396
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:38,238
- You told him to meet you tonight?
- I did.

397
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:40,366
So, what's the rest of his mission?

398
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:44,078
With Anatoli dead, there's only one piece
left to be cleaned up. Perry.

399
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:46,997
We've arranged for him
to meet Chuck at the restaurant.

400
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:51,210
- And Chuck has to bring him in?
- No.

401
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:52,586
Chuck has to kill him.

402
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:55,047
What?

403
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:58,550
Chuck has to kill him?
You're giving him his red test tonight?

404
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:01,762
- That's right.
- Why didn't you tell me?

405
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,431
You would have said
you couldn't be a part of it.

406
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:06,100
I can't.

407
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:09,269
I can't be a part of it, and I won't.

408
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:13,732
You have to meet him.
I can't make him do something like that.

409
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:17,277
I'm not even sure that I want him
to be able to do something like that.

410
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:19,780
I'm sorry, Sarah,
this isn't about what you want.

411
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:22,658
It's about Chuck
and finding out what he's capable of.

412
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:26,578
Perry is a seasoned agent.
He's gonna do anything to save himself.

413
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:29,123
And if Chuck freezes then--

414
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,625
Then we could lose him.

415
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,127
That's why you'll be there.

416
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:38,048
If you give him the order,
if you tell him to kill Perry, he'll do it.

417
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:12,332
Hey.

418
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:18,255
Wow, you look great.
Better than great.

419
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:21,508
Thank you. You look great too.

420
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:24,011
Thank you very much.
Feel pretty good.

421
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:29,600
Right off the bat, I just--
I want to apologize.

422
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,853
I wanna say I'm sorry
if I came across too strong last night.

423
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:36,023
With the way things seem to be
progressing between you and Shaw...

424
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,859
- ...I wanted to tell you how I felt and I--
- Chuck.

425
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,527
I'm doing it again, aren't I?

426
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:43,489
Heh, heh. I'm coming across too strong,
I'm sorry about that.

427
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,700
Appetizer? Let's have an appetizer.

428
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:49,703
No. What am I thinking?
I gotta thank you. Thank you.

429
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:52,456
- I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.
- Don't say that.

430
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,208
But it's true.

431
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:59,421
Chuck, you're gonna wanna stay calm
right now. Okay, I need you to trust me.

432
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:03,383
Why? You planning on surprising me
with something?

433
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:07,221
- Is that what this is?
- Something like that.

434
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:13,268
Your mission isn't over, Chuck.

435
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:22,569
The man in the photo is the man
that you ID'd last night.

436
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:24,279
He's a traitor who continues...

437
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:27,074
...to put civilians and agents
and the nation at risk.

438
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:30,953
We have arranged for you
to meet him here in five minutes' time.

439
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,913
He knows you're CIA.

440
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:37,751
And he will remain cautious
and probably try to maintain his cover.

441
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:58,939
The final part of your mission
is to kill him.

442
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,277
Are you being serious right now?

443
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:06,446
Are you kidding me? Kill him?
Here? Now? I can't do that.

444
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:08,198
Then you won't become a spy.

445
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:11,952
But then...

446
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:15,706
...we couldn't--

447
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:19,126
No. Probably not.

448
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:25,173
Sarah, when this started, I didn't think
I had a chance at becoming a real spy.

449
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:30,888
But if I can't do this,
then what'll I be?

450
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:34,182
Then you'll be Chuck
and there is nothing wrong with that.

451
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:40,147
That's all I can say. I'm sorry.
The rest is your decision.

452
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:45,068
Sarah, wait.

453
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:47,571
Are we absolutely sure
about this guy?

454
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,823
Yes, your target is Perry.

455
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,909
Your orders are clear.

456
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:57,998
- I don't know if I can do this.
- The decision is yours, Chuck.

457
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:01,627
But please know
that there is no turning back.

458
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,740
Has Carmichael checked in?

459
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:37,204
Yes, sir. He's right over there.
That table.

460
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,918
Carmichael?

461
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:46,922
Uh, yeah. Yeah, that's me.

462
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:53,053
Hope this doesn't take too long.
Got a date later.

463
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:58,058
Yeah. That shouldn't be a problem.
This should be fast.

464
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:03,063
These are some photos of some folks
that I work with.

465
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:07,818
Just wanted to see
if maybe you recognize any of them?

466
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,444
Yeah, maybe I will.

467
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:12,739
Sort of pride myself
on never forgetting faces.

468
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:15,492
I should hit the restroom first,
though, is that okay?

469
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,744
Yeah, yeah. Sure, not a problem.

470
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,540
- Get up.
- Okay.

471
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:47,709
- Get up. Get up.
- Okay. Relax, relax.

472
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:51,338
Relax, relax. Look, I had no choice.
I had no choice.

473
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:54,091
- People at The Ring, you have no idea.
- I have an idea.

474
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,760
You know these people
were not gonna put me in jail.

475
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,845
They were going to kill me.

476
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,350
You're not here to arrest me either.

477
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:08,605
I should've known.
You might as well be one of them.

478
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,904
I am not one of them.
I will never be one of them.

479
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:19,032
And for that very reason,
I am going to arrest you.

480
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,703
In fact, at this very moment consider
yourself officially arrested. Okay?

481
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:25,372
Okay? Now, you and I--

482
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,707
You and I, we're gonna take a nice...

483
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:31,378
...friendly, calm, leisurely walk
out of this men's room.

484
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:34,965
Turn around.
Turn around, turn around.

485
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:51,064
Sarah, what's happening?

486
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:54,609
Do you mind easing up on that piece?
My back's all screwed up.

487
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,736
Thanks, buddy.

488
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:58,738
Slow it down, okay?

489
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:00,448
Hey, slow down.

490
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:07,807
Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it.
Don't you see? This is what they want.

491
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:09,226
I gave you a chance.

492
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:11,645
Please. I had no choice.

493
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:48,223
Well?

494
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,602
Chuck is a spy.

495
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:02,570
What does all this mean, Casey?

496
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:04,990
I mean, technically, I failed my test.

497
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:09,411
You need to understand that to Walker,
Shaw and Beckman, you passed.

498
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:12,747
To them, you killed Perry,
exactly what you were trained to do.

499
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:15,166
Yeah, except that I didn't do it,
you did.

500
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,502
Chuck, I'm a civilian, which means...

501
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,879
...under the law,
what happened was murder.

502
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:23,800
No one can know the truth
about that, ever.

503
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,011
Not even Sarah.
She'd be implicated too.

504
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:28,596
But all that means
that I'm still not a real spy.

505
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:30,932
I don't know who I am.
I don't know what I am.

506
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,226
I can't answer
that one for you, Chuck.

507
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,439
Hey.

508
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,067
Why did you do it?

509
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:43,320
Because you weren't going to.

510
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,281
You're not a killer, Chuck.

511
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,533
Thanks.

512
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,413
Come on, Sarah.

513
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,207
Where are you?

514
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,216
Sarah?

515
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:26,196
Good evening, Chuck.
Congratulations.

516
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,323
You are now officially an agent.

517
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,576
Included is a plane ticket
to Washington...

518
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:34,829
...for your immediate final induction
and processing.

519
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:54,391
Come on, Sarah.

520
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:02,065
Sarah, hey, it's me.

521
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:06,403
I need to talk to you.

522
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:09,280
About everything.

523
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,366
Are you okay?

524
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:15,745
I just didn't think that he would do it.

525
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,748
They want me to fly to D.C. tonight.

526
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:23,086
And now I realize that it's my fault
that he did.

527
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,463
Please call me back
as soon as you get this.

528
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:27,424
Chuck made his own choice.

529
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:31,511
And like the rest of us,
he did it to serve his country.

530
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,431
At dinner he said
he wouldn't even be here...

531
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,599
...if it wasn't for me,
and he was right.

532
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:40,019
- Are you still in love with him?
- No.

533
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:43,273
Not anymore.

534
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:50,155
It's just, he's not gonna be
the same person again.

535
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:53,741
I know I wasn't. I remember
everything about my red test.

536
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:58,913
A street name and a time to be there.

537
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,917
No name, just a photo.

538
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:09,966
And it was all happening
the way it was supposed to and then--

539
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,929
And then she dropped something,
like a piece of jewelry, and--

540
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:19,559
I couldn't do it.
Not with her on the ground like that.

541
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:22,395
So I just kept walking.

542
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:27,442
And then, in the reflection,
I saw her reaching for a weapon.

543
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:32,489
Well, at least I thought
I saw her reaching.

544
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:38,620
And I wanted to go back
and check, to make sure.

545
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:39,787
But it was--

546
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:42,123
There was no time.

547
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:45,084
It's never easy.

548
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:47,587
But in the end it helps to save lives.

549
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,298
Never forget that.

550
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:54,677
It was the worst day of my life.

551
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:03,311
Thank God, Sarah.

552
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,735
- Hey.
- Good evening, Agent Bartowski.

553
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:12,362
Your flight leaves in an hour.

554
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,823
I'm here to take you to the airport.
Are you ready?
