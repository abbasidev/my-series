1
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:04,753
I'm Chuck. Here's a few things
you might need to know:

2
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:09,925
Your dreams are also proof of stress
the Intersect puts on your brain...

3
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:13,971
...likely leading to serious
mental deterioration.

4
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:17,725
- Shaw, you're not bleeding anymore.
- That's right, Chuck, I'm not.

5
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:20,477
- What does that mean?
- It means I'm still alive.

6
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:23,313
- Shaw!
- You work for the CIA?

7
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:26,525
This is about your father.
There are bad people looking for him.

8
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,193
Including John Casey.

9
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:31,280
Last time he left, he made sure
I had a way to contact him.

10
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,777
- Hello?
- Justin.

11
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,695
- Ellie, hey.
- Hey. I contacted my dad.

12
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:56,031
- Can we meet?
- Yeah. Same place as last time.

13
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,033
Okay. I'll be there in 10 minutes.

14
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:00,494
Hey, Morgan. Hey, buddy.

15
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:03,413
Listen, I had another dream last night.

16
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:05,666
It was about Shaw.

17
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,293
No, I haven't told Sarah yet.

18
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:12,214
I realize that honesty is important in
a relationship. Who do you think I am?

19
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:15,551
Listen, just meet me at the Buy More
in, like, 10 or 15, okay?

20
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:18,262
- Whose relationship are you talking about?
- Huh? Uh...

21
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:20,973
Morgan's. Morgan's.
Yeah, Morgan and Anna. The past.

22
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,100
He's been really tore up about her lately.

23
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:27,437
- Oh, I thought he rejected her recently.
- He did. He did. He did.

24
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:32,067
But the heart is a very-- It's--
A heart is a very complicated muscle, so...

25
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,069
Have I told you
how beautiful you look?

26
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:38,574
I mean, just, aah! Really.
And you smell... fantastic too.

27
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:40,742
Oh, hey.
Maybe that was just the Pop-Tart.

28
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,661
I gotta go. Bye. Mwah.

29
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,621
Bye.

30
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,959
Wait, wait.
You dreamt Shaw was alive?

31
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,878
Chuck, you saw him die, though.

32
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:52,588
You checked for a pulse, right?

33
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,048
- He fell into a river.
- He fell into a river?

34
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:57,885
Of course Shaw's alive.
Ever seen a John Carpenter movie?

35
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:01,138
Are you gonna help me?
I can't tell Sarah until I'm sure.

36
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,932
- Because she has--
- History with the man. I'm aware.

37
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,768
Chuck, if he's alive,
then he knows everything about her.

38
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:09,271
He knows everything about you.
Everything about me.

39
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,440
Where I work. Where I live. Where I eat.

40
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,609
- Shower.
- Hey, buddy. Hey, yo, Morgan.

41
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:17,446
This is why we, we're gonna find him
and figure out what he's up to, okay?

42
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,406
I need to take care of a few things.

43
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:21,575
Remember, this is between you and I.

44
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:24,203
Stay between me and you.
No problem. Absolutely.

45
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:28,290
Do me a favor before you go. Key me
into Castle. I left something down there.

46
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,834
If you're afraid of Shaw,
I'll let you down there.

47
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:33,921
Thank you. Thank you.
You are a lifesaver, sir, literally.

48
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:35,339
Yeah, good. Okay, fine.

49
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:37,799
- Just don't touch anything.
- Okay.

50
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,227
Okay. Okay. Okay.

51
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,437
Good, good, good.

52
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:53,607
Yes. Oh, baby, come on.

53
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,442
- Morgan.
- What? Oh.

54
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,695
What are you doing here?
Is Chuck up to something?

55
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:01,657
I don't know. You tell me.
You'd know better than I would, heh, heh.

56
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:04,243
Have you seen, uh,
where they keep the bulletproof pants?

57
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:08,288
You know, Morgan, you and I, we, uh--

58
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:09,790
We never talk, really.

59
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:12,876
Talking's a bit overrated.
Plus, we don't have a lot in common.

60
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,379
Although I'd like to get
to know you better--

61
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:18,006
- Sit.
- Okay.

62
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:26,014
You're gonna tell me exactly what's going
on, and you're gonna do it right now.

63
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,446
Reviewing pictures of people you killed?
I do that from time to time.

64
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,573
No.

65
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,284
Chuck.

66
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:48,078
Chuck, we got a problem, bro.
Sarah knows about Shaw.

67
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:51,456
Yeah, yeah, I broke, man, okay?
Your lady's really intimidating.

68
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:55,127
I tried to make eye contact, but she just
kept pulling me in with this gaze.

69
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,463
Morgan, how could you possi--?
What is--? What--?

70
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,883
- Is that a bulletproof vest?
- Is that a bulletproof tie?

71
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,635
- I don't-- What--?
- Give me a br--

72
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,473
That's my dad.

73
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,351
- Why is my dad here?
- What's the problem?

74
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,395
He thinks I quit the CIA.

75
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,857
He does not know
that I downloaded the Intersect 2.0.

76
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,900
Wait, wait, wait. You didn't tell him?

77
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:21,611
He spent so much time
getting the thing out of my head.

78
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:24,323
Why would I tell him that--?
Mush, mush, mush.

79
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,743
Hi. Hey, Dad. Hi. How are you?

80
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,828
What, uh--? What are you doing here?

81
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,580
Your sister contacted me.

82
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,666
I wanted to check with you
and make sure everything was okay.

83
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,418
Is that--?

84
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:40,547
- Is that John Casey?
- That is John Casey. Of course.

85
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:44,343
- Yeah. You know that he works here.
- Why? He's an NSA agent...

86
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,597
...and if the Intersect project
was disbanded, why would he--?

87
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:52,017
- Shaw?
- Sarah, you remember my father.

88
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:56,772
Oh, hi, Mr. Bartowski.
It's great to see you.

89
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,148
Why is your handler here?

90
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,901
Handler... No.

91
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,279
Oh, you've been out of the loop,
so I can't expect you to know this.

92
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,698
Sarah and I are boyfriend
and girlfriend now.

93
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,116
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi.

94
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:12,245
Tell me that you're not in the CIA
anymore. Tell me that you quit.

95
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:16,375
Dad, the Intersect is out of my head.
I've moved on.

96
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:19,544
I can assure you--
We can assure you...

97
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,507
...that I'm no longer a spy.

98
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,176
You know me. I wouldn't lie.

99
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:15,142
This is incredible. From the outside,
it looks like a regular office building.

100
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:18,979
Well, that's the point. We're the CIA.
Nothing's what it seems.

101
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,398
- Right this way.
- Okay.

102
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,952
- So you were able to contact your dad?
- You could say that.

103
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,247
He's, uh... He's a little neurotic.

104
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,583
A coded message
in the Classified section...

105
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:43,378
...is his way of getting in touch
with me.

106
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:50,218
Perfect. So once he tells you where
he lives, we'll be able to protect him.

107
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:52,220
And you can tell him everything.

108
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:55,223
What about John Casey?
If he's a double agent--

109
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,059
He's been in your building
for three years, observing.

110
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:00,353
There's no reason to think
that'll change now.

111
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:04,774
But this may put your mind at ease.

112
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:08,236
That's a speaker. I don't understand.

113
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:13,617
Like I said, nothing's what it seems.
It's not really a speaker.

114
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,118
It'll protect you.

115
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:18,830
It'll block all of Agent Casey's audio
and visual reads on the courtyard.

116
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:23,293
And, Ellie, if you ever feel nervous,
even for a second, just call me.

117
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,712
You know you can trust me, right?

118
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:27,839
I do.

119
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:33,428
You should tell your dad the truth.
Be honest with the people you love.

120
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,805
And that goes for me too.

121
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,267
I know, Sarah. I'm sorry.
I wanted to tell you about Shaw.

122
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:42,062
It was a dream. I wanted to be sure
before I worried you.

123
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,856
If you dreamt Shaw was alive,
you dreamt it for a reason.

124
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,566
The doctor said you're healthy...

125
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:50,278
...and that your dreams could be
as accurate as your flashes, right?

126
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:51,947
Uh, yeah, yeah, that's right.

127
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:55,408
Let's hope so. I'm not letting you go
to Beckman till we know.

128
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,953
I ran a scan
on all of Shaw's known aliases.

129
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,413
No activity since Paris.

130
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:03,208
I think our best shot at finding him
is Walker.

131
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,418
- Why?
- Why?

132
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:08,547
She has an intimate knowledge
of the target.

133
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,466
I think "intimate" is a bit of a stretch.

134
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,469
Walker goes through all the places
she went with Shaw...

135
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,221
...all the things they did...

136
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,140
...maybe you'll flash on something
that'll lead us to him.

137
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:22,227
- Would you be okay with that, Chuck?
- Of course.

138
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,646
Of course. Why wouldn't I be?

139
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:31,361
So, what exactly did you and Shaw do
when you were in D.C.?

140
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:35,031
Casey, heh, they were in and out
of meetings all day, every day.

141
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:38,618
I mean, the trip was purely spy-related.
All business. No pleasure.

142
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:42,372
Walker, I have here a receipt
from a restaurant named Le Jardin.

143
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,500
Two chef's tasting menus,
couple of iced bottles of Pinot.

144
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,795
Doesn't sound like business to me.

145
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,057
After our couple's massage,
he took me to Tiffany's.

146
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,393
- Did he buy you anything?
- Everybody knows...

147
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:06,271
...that you go to Tiffany's to browse,
not buy.

148
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,274
Are those new earrings,
Agent Walker?

149
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:20,744
Okay, so March 22nd,
you and Shaw were off-grid the whole day.

150
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,370
What exactly were you doing?

151
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,122
Objection. Relevance?

152
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,750
What was so compelling
that you didn't check in?

153
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:30,545
We spent the day in his loft downtown,
okay? At the Hoff Building.

154
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,927
Mm-hm.

155
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:41,264
- Was it the penthouse?
- Yes. Did you flash?

156
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:45,477
Shaw ordered the CIA to construct
a TR-15 safe in his penthouse.

157
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,021
Whatever he's hiding there
could lead us to him.

158
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,774
Looks like we're gonna get
to see Shaw's bachelor pad.

159
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:53,777
Although for some of us,
it won't be the first time.

160
00:10:55,529 --> 00:11:00,450
Love hurts, love scars

161
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:05,622
Love wounds and mars

162
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,626
Any heart not tough--

163
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,419
- Hey. Excuse me.
- Yes?

164
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,672
Please stop.

165
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:21,346
Awkward and cruel, but not incorrect.
You're not playing from your soul.

166
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,139
You're soulless in Seattle.

167
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:26,017
Quite a wad of cash you hustled
on Buy More property.

168
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,937
This is our dream. We're on break.
You can't touch us.

169
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:32,107
I don't wanna touch you.
I wanna help you.

170
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:35,485
In case you forgot, I know a thing
or two about management.

171
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:39,280
You're too good to be playing outside
a chain electronics store.

172
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:42,992
If I was your manager, you might
be playing inside a store.

173
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,662
We've already played the Buy More.
We don't need you.

174
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,206
- I'm listening.
- What?

175
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,667
Having a manager
means having respect.

176
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,378
How many times do I have to tell you?
Art: good.

177
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,631
Commercialism:
bad, evil, weird, chubby.

178
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,258
You know what? I'm tired of it.

179
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:01,594
You want his empty words
and his razzmatazz wordplay, you take it.

180
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:05,014
You take it and you go solo
and you see how that works out for you.

181
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:07,726
Just try and stop me
from walking away.

182
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,146
Just try and stop me. You just try.

183
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,356
Try and stop me--
You're not gonna even--?

184
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,816
You know what? Fine.

185
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:19,028
But I'm gonna take something with me
that you can never have back:

186
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:20,363
the "ster."

187
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:25,660
As in "Jeffster." Take the...

188
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,419
Dad?

189
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,006
What is going on?
How did you get in here?

190
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,716
- Ellie. Hi.
- Hi.

191
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:43,094
Dad, I told you that I wanted to come
to you. You shouldn't have--

192
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:47,432
- What are you doing here?
- Why do my children always ask me that?

193
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,143
You're my daughter.
Of course I'm gonna come to you.

194
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:53,271
- Yeah, but--
- And this is safer, okay?

195
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:56,399
- I thought you'd be happy.
- I am. I'm happy.

196
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:59,402
I'm happy. I'm just-- I'm surprised.
In a good way.

197
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,904
Oh.

198
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,072
- Good.
- Ha, ha.

199
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,117
Shaw was a part of our team.

200
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,995
He knows everything:
our weaknesses, including this place.

201
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:12,457
- I'm worried he's gonna come after Ellie.
- We don't know what he wants.

202
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:16,711
Which is why I need your help. I need you
to look after her, make sure she's okay.

203
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:21,800
Until we know what Shaw wants,
Ellie Bartowski has a second shadow.

204
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,219
No. No, you were 5...

205
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:27,388
...and you refused to get out
of the car for school...

206
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:31,226
...unless you were wearing
the Hawkman costume that Ellie made.

207
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:36,523
It's true. I think I still have
that Thanagarian helmet, actually.

208
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,316
Dad, how do you even remember that?

209
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:41,069
I-- You know,
I remember a lot of things.

210
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,612
Uh-huh.

211
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,324
So, what do you guys
wanna do tonight?

212
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,118
Oh, actually, I've got kind
of a date night with Sarah.

213
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:52,163
We're gonna be staying downtown.
It was a last-minute thing.

214
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,792
Well, it'll just be you and me, then.
That'll be great.

215
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,170
We can talk about whatever it is
you wanted to talk about.

216
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:07,387
Oh, no. You know what?
This is, uh... This is the hospital.

217
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,640
I gotta go. I'm still tying up loose ends
from that Africa trip.

218
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,768
- You went to Africa?
- Yeah. It's such a long story.

219
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,771
I'll be back soon, okay? Stay here.

220
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,113
Justin? Thank God you called.

221
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,365
My dad, he just surprised me.
He's here.

222
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,285
In Echo Park?
I thought you were getting his address.

223
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,287
He just showed up. What do I do?

224
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:37,584
- John Casey's home.
- Okay. It's gonna be fine.

225
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:41,629
Meet me at Bellevue Square alone.
We'll figure out what to do about your dad.

226
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,339
Okay.

227
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,764
So this last-minute trip with Sarah...

228
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:54,642
...you're not going on some sort
of a mission, are you?

229
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,061
Dad, we just had a really nice meal,
okay?

230
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,147
What's with all the spy questions?

231
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,816
Because I don't know anything
about your life.

232
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:06,988
And I'm here and I'm trying to figure out
what I missed.

233
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,908
But everywhere I look, I see one thing.

234
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:14,454
Casey works at the Buy More,
Sarah lives with you...

235
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:18,750
...and this is an active surveillance wire,
okay?

236
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:25,924
And your computer is still tapped in
to the CIA mainframe.

237
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,635
So tell me you're not involved
in anything dangerous.

238
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:31,220
That you're not a spy.

239
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:41,397
Okay, I will occasionally do
some analysis work for the CIA.

240
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:44,525
- It's a desk job. A glorified paper-pusher.
- Charles--

241
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:48,529
I sit behind a desk and input data a couple
times a month. It's nothing dangerous.

242
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:51,908
- This thing tonight with Sarah--?
- Is a night away with my girlfriend.

243
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,869
You have nothing to worry about,
Dad.

244
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,205
I'm just an analyst.

245
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,217
Did your ears just pop?

246
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:32,073
Hey, it's me. I'm here and you're not.
I really need to see you.

247
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,409
Devon thinks that I'm at the hospital.

248
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,202
It's getting harder and harder to lie.

249
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,622
Please call me, okay?

250
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:53,720
- So this is Shaw's penthouse, huh?
- Yep.

251
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,431
Great. I'll check over here.

252
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,111
I found the safe.

253
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:16,993
- Well, where is it?
- Put these on.

254
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,371
Hey.

255
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,042
How do you get to it?

256
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:33,593
Oh, it's password-protected.
We're gonna be here a while.

257
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:37,638
Maybe we should start with something
common: birthday, pet's name...

258
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:39,015
...your name.

259
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,353
It's Shaw.

260
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,122
Go, go, go.

261
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:11,524
Wait, wait. No. We need to know
what Shaw wants, okay?

262
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:15,069
- You get the briefcase. I'll make the jump.
- Okay, well, just be careful.

263
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:20,241
Okay, come on, Intersect,
what do you got for me?

264
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,623
This should be interesting.

265
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,306
Shaw?

266
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:50,229
Shaw's dead.

267
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,981
Care to join him?

268
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,485
Did you get him? Did you get him?

269
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:59,113
If you did,
make sure and check his pulse.

270
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,490
- But help me first.
- Hold on. I'm coming.

271
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,659
Help me first
before you check his pulse. Help me.

272
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,954
Sarah, I think he's coming back.

273
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,960
- Dad.
- Just an analyst, huh?

274
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:21,052
So this is my office.

275
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,637
Pretty sleek, huh?

276
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,680
Why weren't you here...

277
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:28,768
...sitting at one of these computers
instead of dangling from a rooftop?

278
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,394
Why are you still lying to me?

279
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,564
Dad, it's like I told you,
the government sees potential in me.

280
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,943
So General Beckman asked
if I'd work as an analyst for the CIA...

281
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:41,739
...and every once in a while, I'll still go
off on, you know, a little field mission.

282
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,784
Would you excuse me?
And don't touch any of the computers...

283
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:48,162
...because I know you want to.
But don't do that.

284
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,207
So the guy on the roof, who was he?

285
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,710
Couldn't get a good look at
our mystery man from the security footage.

286
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:57,213
- How'd he know about the loft?
- Best guess...

287
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:00,299
...when you accessed the penthouse,
you triggered some alert.

288
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:03,219
- He was after this.
- Lockbox.

289
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,054
Just like the one Evelyn Shaw had.

290
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:09,642
- Okay. Well, why does Shaw have one?
- It's a spy's last will and testament.

291
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:13,229
Spies keep a record of information
they might lose if they get killed.

292
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:16,649
In Shaw's case, all the information
that the CIA has on The Ring.

293
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:20,736
My bet is they're gonna want this back.
Hundred bucks says he's working for them.

294
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:24,323
And if The Ring is looking for this,
then it must mean that Shaw is dead.

295
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,496
"My name is Daniel Shaw...

296
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,499
...and if you are reading this,
it means I'm already dead."

297
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,584
I was wrong.

298
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,712
Wrong about what?

299
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:42,550
I've heard the name Daniel Shaw
before. He--

300
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:46,512
He's a special agent for the CIA,
a Ring expert.

301
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,514
I take it that's his lockbox.

302
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,349
- What happened?
- The mission's over.

303
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:51,976
It's never over.

304
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,812
There will always be another one
and another and...

305
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:58,858
The reason a spy has one of those
is because any mission could be their last.

306
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,402
For every spy,
there's someone who cares about him.

307
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,989
Someone who has to open that box,
read that message and mourn their loss.

308
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,491
This is a bad business.

309
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:11,287
I don't want my family any part of it.

310
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,339
Sorry I didn't make it to the square.

311
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,592
- It's fine. Are you okay? What happened?
- I wish I could tell you.

312
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,386
The most pressing issue
is what to do about your father.

313
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:29,889
Do what?
John Casey's watching us like a hawk.

314
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,390
We've devised a new plan.

315
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:33,934
But it's gonna require real spy work
on your part.

316
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,437
You up for it?

317
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:48,240
My name is Jeff, Jeff, Jeff

318
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:52,578
That's right
I said my name is Jeff, Jeff, Jeff

319
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:56,332
That's good, son, but it might be
a little lyrically lacking.

320
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:02,129
Hey, girl, what you got for me?

321
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:04,548
You wanna get up on here
And have a baby with me?

322
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,509
Yeah

323
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,053
Oh, I see how it is

324
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,471
Well, I don't need you

325
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:14,141
Your uterus won't fit my baby in it anyway

326
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:17,478
My name is Jeff, Jeff, Jeff

327
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,146
Hey, you seen Grimes?

328
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:23,526
Lost your friend, did you?
Can't find him because he's changed?

329
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:26,362
You think about the days
you used to drink together...

330
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:30,699
...and hold each other for hours and hours,
just talking about the silliest little things.

331
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:33,119
Those days are no more.

332
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:34,620
They're no--

333
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:43,254
Don't you knock? Shaw is alive, okay?
And he's bringing a reckoning with him.

334
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:46,590
Huh. No one told you, huh? Shaw's dead.

335
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,427
- No. No. Chuck said he--
- Bartowski's wrong.

336
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:52,680
Oh, thank God. Man, someone could've
given me a heads-up here.

337
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:56,434
- I've had to pee for the last four hours.
- But I'm not here for that.

338
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,644
Would Ellie cheat on Devon
for any reason?

339
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:02,106
John Casey, if I had the height
or the willpower, I would slap you now.

340
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,775
Ellie is not a cheater.
The only way she'd step out...

341
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:08,028
...was with someone she's known
her whole life. Someone she trusts.

342
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:10,030
A childhood friend perhaps.
I don't know.

343
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:12,783
I tapped into her phone.
She left this strange message.

344
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:16,120
I need to see you.
Devon thinks that I'm at the hospital.

345
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,539
It's just-- It's getting harder
and harder to lie.

346
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:19,748
That's Ellie.

347
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,711
- Oh, man.
- So, what's the deal?

348
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,171
You've done well, John...

349
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:28,174
...but you're a man who lacks tact
and interpersonal skill.

350
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:32,511
Okay, on behalf of the family,
I'll speak to the husband, all right?

351
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:34,013
This is not gonna be fun.

352
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:38,893
Devon, let me ask you, do you think
Ellie's happy in your marriage?

353
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,644
Of course.

354
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,314
- Why? Did she say something?
- No. No, not exactly.

355
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,233
I feel that if there is something wrong,
it's your fault.

356
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:51,906
So take me through an average day,
and then you talk, I find the problem.

357
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:56,702
Okay. Most mornings, I wake up around 6.
I pop a towel in the dryer so it's warm...

358
00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:00,873
...when she gets out of the shower.
I'll whip her up a Belgian waffle...

359
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,834
...or, you know, a goat-cheese omelet.
Something easy.

360
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:07,046
After Ellie's foot rub,
I'll bike to the farmers' market...

361
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:09,882
...pick up fresh blueberries,
or whatever's in season.

362
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:13,761
Come home, make her a smoothie.
Organic nonfat milk, flaxseed oil.

363
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,096
Something to give her
a real midday kick-start.

364
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:21,936
Once we're in bed,
post-lavender bath...

365
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:24,647
...I spend about 20 minutes
just watching her sleep.

366
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:29,527
She looks so peaceful. It's like,
what's she dreaming about, you know?

367
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:33,822
- Anyway, that's my day, give or take.
- Yeah.

368
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,328
Hey, Dad.

369
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,873
Is everything okay?

370
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,459
I just keep thinking...

371
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:49,588
...without the Intersect...

372
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:52,800
...why would they let you go
on missions?

373
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,052
I mean, you're--

374
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,595
You're an ordinary guy.

375
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:58,764
I'm not.

376
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,059
I'm not an ordinary guy.
The CIA wants me to work for them...

377
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,894
...because they think I'm special.

378
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:09,108
- Because they believe in me.
- You're right.

379
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,360
You are special.

380
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,659
I knew it.

381
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:22,580
- You downloaded the Intersect 2.0.
- You threw a knife at my face.

382
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:26,041
Why would you do that? After I worked
so hard to get the first one out.

383
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:28,252
Dad, knife, face.

384
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,547
- What if you were wrong?
- I'm never wrong.

385
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:39,346
Charles, there's something
that I never told you.

386
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:43,142
The Intersect, it can have
a negative effect on the brain.

387
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,935
Hold on. What?

388
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:48,188
You--? You knew? You--?
You knew, and you didn't tell me?

389
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:50,482
I didn't think I had to.
You didn't tell me...

390
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,694
- ...you downloaded the new one.
- I knew you would disapprove of it.

391
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:57,031
And you know what?
And you left. Again.

392
00:26:57,198 --> 00:27:01,243
You taught me and Ellie how to live life
without you and that's what I'm doing.

393
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,336
I have to go.

394
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:13,756
- Right now.
- What?

395
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:15,966
Wait. Wait. Dad. Dad.
Where are you going?

396
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:20,054
I'm sorry. I can't stay here
and watch my son die.

397
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:29,980
Dad? Dad? You're leaving?
Weren't you gonna say goodbye?

398
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,107
Oh, sorry. I'm, uh...

399
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:36,153
I still don't even know what's wrong,
why you wanted me here.

400
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:39,531
Nothing. Nothing's wrong, Dad.

401
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:42,993
I just, uh-- I missed you and I wanted
to make sure that you were okay.

402
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:45,621
Oh, okay.

403
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:50,000
You don't have to worry
about me, ahh, Eleanor. Um...

404
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,379
This time I won't be gone as long,
I promise.

405
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:56,006
- Okay.
- Okay.

406
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,758
Take care of yourself.

407
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,731
I did it.

408
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:14,024
I planted the tracer.

409
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:15,776
Nice work, Ellie.

410
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:18,612
You've guaranteed
your father's protection.

411
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:46,807
Where's your dad?

412
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:50,436
He found out I was the Intersect,
and he left.

413
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:53,605
Chuck, he must've had
a good reason. He loves you.

414
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:56,442
I know. I--

415
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:58,944
I know that he loves me.
He just doesn't know me.

416
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:01,155
He doesn't know anything about me.

417
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:05,909
Why I became the Intersect.
That I can help people.

418
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:09,997
That for the first time in my life,
what I do actually means something.

419
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:12,291
Did you tell him that?

420
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:13,500
No.

421
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:15,669
I guess I didn't.

422
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:19,590
But I can't talk to him now because he's
gone and I don't know where he lives.

423
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,341
I do.

424
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,345
It's gonna work.

425
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:30,517
In the event that your dad ran off,
I wanted you to be able to find him...

426
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,687
...so I took this.

427
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:43,322
Your misdemeanor aside,
my dad is an incredibly paranoid person...

428
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,824
- ...and I'm sure this isn't his address.
- I know.

429
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:49,495
It was issued by the Bishop County DMV.
I checked all the utility databases.

430
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:51,997
This is the only house
without cable, water, gas...

431
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,792
...but also consumes
an incredible amount of electricity.

432
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:57,002
So I'm pretty sure that's your dad's house.

433
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,420
Wow.

434
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,506
- That's so...
- Spyish?

435
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,133
Well, I am a spy.

436
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,394
- We're at the house.
- Good.

437
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:16,188
Don't call me until you have it.

438
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:45,884
Well, this must be it.

439
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,889
I'm gonna go in
and tell him how I feel.

440
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:54,434
- Do you want me to come with you?
- No, it's okay.

441
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:57,396
But if I'm not back in 20 minutes,
you come save me.

442
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,606
Okay.

443
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,531
Where is it?

444
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,200
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Yes, you do.

445
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:13,120
My employer knows
that you have an Intersect.

446
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,290
Where's the thing
that's keeping you alive?

447
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:19,126
Dad, it's me.

448
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:21,879
Don't worry. I'm alone.

449
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,136
Give me a break.

450
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,479
Cut it. We'll make this
look like an accident.

451
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:43,275
That's not safe. That's not safe.
He shouldn't be doing that.

452
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:46,486
Mr. Bartowski,
this will all be a lot less painful...

453
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:48,614
...if you tell me
where the Governor is.

454
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:52,826
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Not you. Your father.

455
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:55,996
- Aha. What is he talking about?
- The Governor.

456
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,832
Oh.

457
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,627
It's the watch, isn't it?

458
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:04,004
No.

459
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,631
- Tie them up.
- Dad.

460
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:09,509
Let's clear out. We don't wanna be here
when this place goes up.

461
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:12,638
I'm sorry about this.
You shouldn't have come here.

462
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:16,683
- I don't wanna drag you into anything.
- Dad. Dad, I came up.

463
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:20,354
I came here because I wanted to tell you
why I downloaded the Intersect.

464
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:22,272
That I'm special and can help people.

465
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:26,485
But given the circumstances,
I think I'm just gonna have to show you.

466
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,538
No guns! The gas!

467
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:40,332
That's a good idea.

468
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:25,669
Does she have the Intersect too?

469
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:28,880
No, Dad.

470
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:31,091
That's all her.

471
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,509
Hi, honey.

472
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:43,353
Hey. Come in.

473
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:46,648
I don't know how The Ring
found my cabin.

474
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:51,403
But I do know what they came for.

475
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:04,166
I call it the Governor
because it sort of governs the Intersect.

476
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,418
See, I realized through the years...

477
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:09,963
...that, just like a computer,
that the Intersect can overheat.

478
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:13,675
- Is that what's happening to me?
- See, your brain is like a circuit...

479
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:17,846
...and when you flash, it releases
a surge of electrical energy.

480
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:21,141
But if it's not controlled,
it can lead to dementia and insanity...

481
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:24,978
...maybe even death,
but I've been working on a fix...

482
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:28,607
...and this is the closest
that I've gotten to one.

483
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:33,320
See, it, um--
It governs my neural network...

484
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:36,156
...and helps control
the power of the Intersect...

485
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:39,785
...almost like a pacemaker would
for the heart.

486
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,662
Could something like that
work for the 2.0?

487
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,664
Well, I couldn't tell you about it...

488
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:48,668
...because I needed
to go back to my cabin to be sure...

489
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:50,337
...but, Charles, it will.

490
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,174
I'm gonna make you one.

491
00:34:56,677 --> 00:35:01,681
You're my son
and you downloaded the 2.0...

492
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:05,018
...for the same reason
I created the original: to help people.

493
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:07,395
You wanna be a spy.

494
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:10,023
I'm gonna do everything I can...

495
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,025
...to help you be
the man you wanna be.

496
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,029
Thanks.

497
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,532
Thank you.

498
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:28,667
Lester, I wanna help you be
the man you ought to be.

499
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,211
It's too late.

500
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:35,549
Jeff will be huge here, then he'll be huge
in Japan, and then it's over.

501
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:39,261
Boy, don't you see? The man made
a banner that said, "Jeff?"

502
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,429
As if it were a question.

503
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:43,390
He doesn't know who he is
without you.

504
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:46,059
You're more than just the "ster"
in "Jeffster."

505
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,728
You're the "ster" that stirs the drink.

506
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:53,441
I won't be fooled by corporate trickery.
I will never bow down to the man.

507
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:55,360
I'm not the man.

508
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,404
I'm a man.

509
00:35:57,905 --> 00:36:00,740
A man who once had a dream too.

510
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:05,245
- You ever heard of Earth, Wind & Fire?
- Yeah. They jammed.

511
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:08,248
For a short time in 1988...

512
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:11,585
...we were called
Earth, Wind, Fire & Rain.

513
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,297
I was Rain.

514
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:19,926
My God.

515
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:26,600
I can't wear this anymore, but you have
the hips of a 6-year-old girl.

516
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,936
Use them.

517
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,277
Where do I sign?

518
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:40,947
Just depends on your HD...

519
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:43,783
Excuse me, guys.
Can I speak to you for a second, please?

520
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:45,118
Excuse me.

521
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,245
- Yeah?
- I talked to Captain Awesome.

522
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:51,458
- And?
- If he'd have me, I'd let him.

523
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,293
It's-- Look, what I'm saying is...

524
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:57,005
As much as it pains me to say it,
if there's a problem, it's on Ellie's side.

525
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,591
Let me ask you something.
Why are you doing this?

526
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:02,928
I gave Chuck my word
I'd make sure his sister was okay.

527
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:08,850
Okay. What time is it here? Awesome's
volunteering at the animal shelter.

528
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:12,312
Ellie's working a late shift.
The apartment should be completely empty.

529
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,315
Perfect. I'm gonna go take a look.

530
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:47,013
- Ellie, are you with your husband?
- My husband's not home.

531
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:49,557
Everybody thinks that I'm working.

532
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:52,519
- Do you expect him home soon?
- No. It's safe.

533
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:54,854
- You're sure?
- Yeah. You can come here.

534
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:57,774
- Good. I'm already on my way.
- Oh, okay, good.

535
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:02,404
There's someone in the house.

536
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:05,824
- How close are you?
- Close. I may not get there in time.

537
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:07,867
Go to the speaker.

538
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:13,206
- Okay.
- Now open it.

539
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:15,333
- How?
- Press all three buttons at once...

540
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:17,335
...and wait for a click.

541
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,596
- Justin, no, I can't.
- Someone's in your house, Ellie.

542
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:32,767
He could hurt you, hurt your family.
Now, take the gun.

543
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:01,546
Huh.

544
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,050
Ellie, wait!

545
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,432
Justin. Justin, John Casey--

546
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,060
Don't worry, you're safe.
Come with me.

547
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,449
What's wrong?

548
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:35,747
I've been thinking about
what happened at the cabin...

549
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:38,500
...and how you almost died.

550
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:43,463
You know, everything that your dad said
about the life we've chosen, he's right.

551
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,965
What we do is not safe.

552
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,636
I want you to have this.

553
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:53,348
My spy will.

554
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:59,437
- Why are you giving me this?
- Chuck, this is me.

555
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:03,817
It's everything I know. It's my life.
And if something were to happen to me...

556
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:09,322
Well, if anyone's gonna have it,
I want it to be you.

557
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:13,993
Nothing's gonna happen to you.
You're not going anywhere.

558
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,748
And neither am I.

559
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:34,848
You'll be safe here until we figure out
what to do about John.

560
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:37,684
I'm so sorry. I just--
I couldn't-- I couldn't--

561
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:40,395
- Is my dad gonna be okay?
- Don't worry. He's protected.

562
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:43,690
- What about my husband? My brother?
- They're fine, I promise.

563
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,733
You've done everything we've asked.

564
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:49,195
You've been incredibly brave,
and trust me, this is almost over.

565
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:53,366
Now, wait here. I'll be back soon.

566
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:14,012
My name is Chuck Bartowski,
and if you're reading this...

567
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,555
...it means I'm already dead.

568
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:19,517
I don't know
what will end up killing me...

569
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:24,522
...but I've chosen to be a spy,
and there are consequences to that.

570
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:31,362
It may be my emotions
that end up doing me in...

571
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,867
...or a slip-up
trying to protect my friends...

572
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,245
...or my family...

573
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:44,209
...who never wanted me
to be a part of this.

574
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:50,965
My team was captured. This needs
to happen now. No more waiting.

575
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:17,909
Or it could be the thing
I never saw coming.

576
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:20,161
But I know it's coming.
