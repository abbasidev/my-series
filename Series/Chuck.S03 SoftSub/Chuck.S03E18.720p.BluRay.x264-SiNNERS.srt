1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:05,337
I'm Chuck. Here's a couple
of things you need to know.

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,715
I had a fiancée. Now she thinks I'm dead.

3
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:09,717
Alex.

4
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:11,260
You got a daughter, Casey.

5
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:15,222
- Do you think Ellie's happy in your marriage?
- Of course. Did she say something?

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,642
This is about your father.
There are some bad people looking for him.

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,644
Including a man named John Casey.

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,024
I knew it.
You downloaded the Intersect 2.0.

9
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:28,610
The Intersect,
it can have a negative effect on the brain.

10
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:31,113
Your dreams are all proof of stress...

11
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:34,950
...likely leading
to serious mental deterioration.

12
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:37,119
So, what did you wanna tell me?
About the doctor?

13
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:40,998
He said that I'm fine.

14
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:44,293
Wait a minute. You dreamt Shaw was alive?
Chuck, you saw him die.

15
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:48,213
It's called the Governor.
It governs my neural network.

16
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,049
Control the power of the Intersect.

17
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,009
Could that work for the 2.0?

18
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,011
It will. I'm gonna make you one.

19
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:59,516
So how's everything, uh--?
How's everything coming?

20
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:02,352
Same as last time you asked me.

21
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:06,023
Can I get you anything?
Like a-- Like a juice? Or coffee?

22
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,524
Maybe a breakfast sandwich?

23
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,151
I'm fine, Charles. Just relax.

24
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:11,028
Relax. That's good.

25
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,529
That's good.

26
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:16,283
Is this really gonna work?
This whole Governor thingy?

27
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,035
I'm still alive, aren't I?

28
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:21,080
Look, based on the schematics
of my own Governor...

29
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:24,458
...I'm gonna create a new one
that'll control Intersect 2.0 before--

30
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:28,045
Before what? Before I go nuts? Because
that's exactly what The Ring wants.

31
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:31,840
Your brain is working fine so far.
Who wouldn't be paranoid in your shoes?

32
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:34,009
Your cover's blown, base discovered...

33
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:37,096
...your dead partner and
girlfriend's ex-lover was a double agent.

34
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:41,517
- Way to talk me down, Dad.
- What I-- What I'm trying to say is...

35
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:43,602
...your courage makes me very proud.

36
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:47,940
But there's some battles
you have to walk away from.

37
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:55,739
What are you saying, run? Turn my back
on everyone that I care about?

38
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:59,243
There may come a time
when if you wanna protect them...

39
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,372
...you have to go.

40
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:07,084
- Go where?
- Vacation.

41
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:11,088
Dad was saying he thinks I might need
to get out of here, take a little break.

42
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,423
Well, he's right.
You've been a little nervous.

43
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:15,717
So is this what you two
have been working on?

44
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:18,762
Yeah, a little family heirloom
Dad's just sprucing up for me.

45
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:23,350
He doesn't need you looking over
his shoulder. You can use some fresh air.

46
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,727
She's right, Charles. Smell the roses.

47
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:28,981
I'd really rather not, Dad.
Seasonal allergies. Runs in the family.

48
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,817
Listen to the man.
He knows what's best for you.

49
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,784
Dude. You don't look so hot, buddy.

50
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:44,037
Compared to normal level of hotness,
you've lost a little sizzle.

51
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:47,749
I'm looking for my wife, Morgan.
She didn't come home last night.

52
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,251
- You don't say.
- I do say.

53
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,003
Why would I know where Ellie is? Heh.

54
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:54,173
Why did you think there was something
wrong with our marriage?

55
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,300
No reason. You know, just kind of--

56
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:59,887
Don't BS me. If something is up with Ellie,
I wanna know about it now.

57
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,598
Oh, boy.

58
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,476
She's having an affair.
She's cheating on you, bro.

59
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,187
What? That's impossible.

60
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:12,441
Casey intercepted an illicit phone message
and he played it for me.

61
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,318
- Ellie would never--
- Devon.

62
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,320
- Whoa.
- I'm sorry.

63
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:17,696
You just called me Devon.

64
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:20,073
Yeah. Well, this is no time for frivolity.

65
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,285
I need to see you.

66
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:26,788
Devon thinks I'm at the hospital.
It's getting harder and harder to lie.

67
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,543
I know.

68
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,086
How could she do this to us?

69
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,257
I need to call my wife.

70
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:40,552
I gotta get in on some of this Ellie action.

71
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,388
That is why I choose not to get married.

72
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,808
That's why I ward them off.

73
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:53,523
I need to call my husband.
It's weird, I'm not getting a signal.

74
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:56,068
It's blocked.
We can't have enemy operatives...

75
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,737
- ...like John Casey tracking you.
- He's on the loose?

76
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,657
He had fled by the time our team
got to your apartment.

77
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:04,993
- I have to call Chuck. I have to protect him.
- Ellie.

78
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:08,497
We're in the process of bringing
your brother in. You're safe here.

79
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,250
And John Casey knows better
than to show his face soon.

80
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,254
One apple pie.

81
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,672
And one cup of coffee.

82
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,548
Black and bitter.

83
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:20,050
Actually, I didn't order yet.

84
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:23,220
I ordered for you. It was easy.
You always get the same thing.

85
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,931
And you always sit in the same seat
facing the door.

86
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:29,268
A creature of habit, what can I say?

87
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,104
- What happened to your face?
- Hmm?

88
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,356
Kitchen accident. It's nothing.

89
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:38,068
Hey, how'd that, uh, criminal psych final
of yours go?

90
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,487
Piece of cake.
I'm set to graduate next week.

91
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,991
Your days of slinging pie are numbered.

92
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:47,244
Don't worry. I'll make sure the next girl
gets your order right.

93
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:50,163
You won't even miss me, John.

94
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,375
Thanks, Alex.

95
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:00,549
All of these people,
any of whom could be Ring agents.

96
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,342
Come on. Switch off your spy mode.

97
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:06,096
- You're gonna drive yourself crazy.
- I've been down that road, haven't I?

98
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:10,726
Well, the CIA shrink said that you have
nothing to worry about, remember?

99
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,061
Other than The Ring trying
to kill my father...

100
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:16,898
...or me imagining that Shaw
is still out there and trying to kill me.

101
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:21,028
Look, your father is safe and not only that,
but he's here with you, which is great.

102
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,530
And Shaw? Shaw is dead.

103
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:27,117
I know what you went through.
You have to start putting it behind you.

104
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,413
- What if I can't?
- Mm. Then there is always blueberries.

105
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:35,167
How is this possibly supposed to make--?
Oh, my God, these are amazing blueberries.

106
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,795
Mm-hm. Wait till you try them with cream.
Be right back.

107
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,172
But--

108
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,800
Beautiful day, isn't it?

109
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,553
Beautiful day, isn't it?

110
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:52,809
- Well, you have a good one. Thank you.
- Those look so good.

111
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:06,198
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

112
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,503
Excuse me.

113
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:21,963
Ma'am. Whoa, excuse me.

114
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,261
I gotta go.

115
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,154
I must be losing my mind.

116
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:43,378
Sure this isn't one
of your Intersect dreams?

117
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:46,965
Yes. As a matter of fact, I am sure.
Okay, Shaw is alive.

118
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,134
He was taunting me.
We have to call Beckman.

119
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,887
Already tried.
Her assistant said that she's indisposed.

120
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:54,055
Indisposed?
What is that supposed to mean?

121
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:56,266
The guy that I killed
is back from the dead.

122
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,560
A guy who, keep in mind,
is a Ring operative.

123
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,687
Who knows our covers, where Castle is.

124
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:03,356
- What station did you see him in?
- North Hollywood.

125
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,526
- Time?
- Maybe half an hour ago.

126
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,778
- North or southbound?
- South.

127
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:11,907
Any of this look familiar?

128
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:14,826
You can't miss Bartowski
running around like a chicken.

129
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,828
Slow it down.

130
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,915
Punch in. Right there, Dad.

131
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,418
Oh, my God. Daniel.

132
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,009
Uh, do we know what station he got off at?

133
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:34,012
One sec. Let me run
the facial-recognition software.

134
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,350
Hollywood and Western.

135
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:41,937
Bingo. Where did he exit?

136
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,565
There he is.

137
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,943
What the hell is he doing?

138
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,819
We need to follow Shaw, take him down.

139
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,032
That's one way. Other option
is they're leading you into a trap.

140
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,451
It's not like we're going in
empty-handed.

141
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:01,581
- You know how I feel about this, Charles.
- Yeah, I do. But I don't have a choice.

142
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:04,918
Exactly what The Ring wants you to think.
There's always a choice.

143
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:08,046
What choice would that be, Dad?
To run away?

144
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,258
I'm not you. I'm not gonna spend
the rest of my life in hiding.

145
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:13,426
I can't leave the ones I love behind.

146
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:17,931
Let's go.

147
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,981
It's been a long time since I kissed you

148
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,900
Hey, hey, hey. What are you--

149
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,736
--doing here, man?

150
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,530
My life is over.

151
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,782
My wife has given herself
to another man.

152
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,410
Hey. Your wife has given you a pass.

153
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,787
You're now free to mount
whomever you wish to.

154
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:44,457
If he had been doing more mounting,
he wouldn't be in this situation.

155
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:49,379
You think that my wife is unfaithful to me
because I'm not satisfying her?

156
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:52,382
While you're wasting your time
at the gym or the hospital...

157
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,968
...your wife is at home alone,
unoccupied.

158
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,886
So she hired herself a pinch hitter.

159
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:00,348
Can't believe your missus
has taken on new customers.

160
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:01,683
It's my dream come true.

161
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:05,812
Ellie is exactly like Chuck,
but with lady parts.

162
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,480
Okay, I'm gonna go now.

163
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,274
- Unh!
- Whoa, whoa. Come on.

164
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,861
That's the spirit, son. Show the old lady
you know how to swing that bat.

165
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,529
Nice work, guys. Awesome.

166
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:18,408
- What?
- No, not you, Awesome. That--

167
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:23,830
General, I wanna thank you in advance
for your testimony.

168
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:27,042
It's my understanding
you've been in charge of the Intersect...

169
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,544
...since it accidentally was put
into a civilian.

170
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,546
A one Charles Bartowski.

171
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,717
- Is that correct?
- Yes, sir, that is correct.

172
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:40,347
Is it also correct that the project has fallen
well short of its original expectations?

173
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,682
Yes, sir, also correct.

174
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:46,353
But if I may add, Agents Bartowski,
Walker and Colonel Casey...

175
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,731
...have proven to be an excellent,
albeit unorthodox team.

176
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:04,788
The mission is to grab Shaw or kill him.
Whichever's quicker.

177
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:12,796
Hey, open sesame.

178
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:19,010
Okay. We'll split up. Each take a floor.

179
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,326
General Merriweather,
members of the tribunal...

180
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:44,619
...you must understand.

181
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:48,456
Agent Bartowski has in many ways
exceeded expectations.

182
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:52,127
I am not denying
that the road has been long and rocky.

183
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:53,795
But after three years...

184
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:58,466
...Charles Bartowski is poised to become
the weapon we have always dreamed of.

185
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,561
- Justin. What's going on?
- We've been breached.

186
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,229
- Casey, isn't it?
- Don't worry.

187
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:15,525
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you,
Ellie. We can handle John Casey.

188
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:20,864
- You're supposed to be upstairs.
- Searched the whole floor.

189
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:23,366
Nobody here.
Something wrong with this place.

190
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:26,578
Look.
It's a government-grade biometric scanner.

191
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,998
You'll never get through that.
Come on, let's go.

192
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,505
Casey, this is not a Ring base.
It's one of ours.

193
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,466
We gotta go find Chuck.

194
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:47,932
Justin?

195
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,623
- Justin?
- Unh!

196
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:16,503
Chuck?

197
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,047
Ellie.

198
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,181
Ellie. Ellie, what are you doing here?

199
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:32,477
What are you doing here?
You just punched a person.

200
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,687
Thought you quit kung fu
in the third grade.

201
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:38,483
I-- Look, I'll explain later. Right now,
we have to get out of here. Come on.

202
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,360
No. You don't understand.

203
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:43,363
You've been brought for protection.
Justin is my CIA handler.

204
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:47,242
CIA handler? You don't understand, okay?
This guy is not CIA.

205
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:50,411
- Everyone works for an evil organization.
- Jeremy.

206
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,623
Chuck, wait.

207
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,335
In conclusion, general...

208
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:01,381
...I would stake my reputation
on the success of Agent Bartowski.

209
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:13,226
- As you were saying, General Beckman?
- What the hell are you doing, Bartowski?

210
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,436
Chuck, what the hell is going on?

211
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:20,316
Apparently, I have no idea.

212
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,662
- Where's my sister?
- She's being escorted back to her residence.

213
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,205
What was she doing here?

214
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:39,669
- You are dismissed.
- General, what the hell is going on?

215
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,925
I don't know how else to explain it,
Chuck.

216
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:49,596
But all our asse-- Careers are on the line.

217
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:52,849
Committee is here to determine
if Intersect Project is a liability.

218
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:56,144
Let me talk to them. Shaw is somewhere
in this building, we saw him.

219
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:59,522
If there is one thing you can do
to protect the Intersect Project...

220
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,442
...it's keep your mouth shut.

221
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:07,655
Walker, Casey and Bartowski, it's been
brought to this committee's attention...

222
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:12,327
...the Intersect is unstable, expensive,
and most of all, dangerous.

223
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,495
- That's outrageous.
- Sit down, Chuck.

224
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:18,291
I'm sorry, general. Generals, this is crazy.
Provide one shred of evidence.

225
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,710
- Who said this?
- I did.

226
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,304
Hello, Chuck.

227
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,016
Sarah.

228
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:37,852
Shaw?

229
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,483
This man that stands before you
is a Ring operative.

230
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:46,361
He kidnapped me and he drugged me
and he tried to kill me.

231
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:49,530
All of that is completely true.
Except for the killing part.

232
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:52,367
In fact,
I was sanctioned by this committee--

233
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:54,953
Why was I not apprised of this,
General Merriweather?

234
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,121
Continue, Agent Shaw.

235
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:00,375
I was acting as a double agent,
working within The Ring.

236
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:04,087
- That is, until Chuck shot me.
- He's lying. Do not listen to a word he says.

237
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:07,298
I came here today
to make one thing perfectly clear.

238
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,926
Charles Bartowski is an American hero.

239
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:15,098
He didn't ask for the Intersect. It's not
Chuck's fault that his brain is deteriorating.

240
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:18,476
Excuse me, Agent Bartowski
was given a full psychological exam...

241
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,020
- ...and he was cleared for all field work.
- Sarah.

242
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,898
Do you wanna tell her the truth,
or should I?

243
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:28,236
- What is he talking about, Chuck?
- Dr. Dreyfus' report.

244
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:33,074
"The subject's mental decline
is both inevitable and irreversible.

245
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,952
Agent Bartowski's mind
will soon succumb to paranoia...

246
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,956
...dementia, psychosis. Possibly worse."

247
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,667
I understand why your boyfriend
didn't wanna worry you.

248
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,502
Sarah, I was gonna tell you.

249
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:51,092
It is my recommendation
that the Intersect Project be aborted.

250
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,762
Before any decisions are made...

251
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:58,850
...this committee needs to review
the Intersect's successful missions.

252
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:02,186
Hugo Panzer.
Taken out by Bartowski's team.

253
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:06,190
With a combination of a fencing foil,
nunchakus and turbulence.

254
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,067
Alexis White. Died while trying...

255
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:21,372
- Guys. Casey. Sarah.
- Zip it, Bartowski. Figure a way out later.

256
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,083
No, but-- He's an Intersect.

257
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,502
Daniel Shaw is an Intersect.

258
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,379
Sit down, Agent Bartowski.

259
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:32,425
It's okay, general. I'm glad you're
seeing this. See, he's not in control.

260
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:33,926
I'm in complete control.

261
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:36,137
I realize that what I'm about to do now...

262
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,973
...might come across
as some kind of insane gesture...

263
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,975
...or maybe a completely
insane gesture.

264
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,685
But because I am, in fact, sane...

265
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:45,646
...and I am certain
that Daniel Shaw is an Intersect...

266
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:48,024
...I'm just gonna have to prove it to you.

267
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,735
Chuck, no.

268
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:56,991
- He's supposed to catch it.
- Guards, remove Mr. Bartowski!

269
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,367
No, he's an Intersect.

270
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:02,497
No, he's an Intersect! Sarah, I'm sorry.

271
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:05,041
These proceedings are adjourned
until further notice.

272
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,087
We gotta get out. Walked into a trap.

273
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,464
- What about Chuck?
- Nothing we can do for him.

274
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:14,175
We have to call Washington
and tell them what's going on.

275
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,802
Most of Washington is in that room.

276
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,845
Shaw and The Ring
have taken over the CIA.

277
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:21,974
He's got the whole chain of command. God
knows how many Ring agents are inside.

278
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,894
It's only a matter of time
before they burn us too.

279
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,270
So you're just gonna run?

280
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,856
It's not just us they're gonna come after.

281
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,983
They'll come after
the people we care about.

282
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:32,693
- You coming?
- No.

283
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:36,531
Everything I care about
is inside this building.

284
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,408
Good luck, Agent Walker.

285
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:40,827
Sarah.

286
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,547
- Ellie.
- Devon...

287
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:55,216
...I need to talk to you.

288
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,801
Where have you been all night?

289
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,220
I need you to listen to me really carefully.

290
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:02,056
I have been keeping a secret
and I feel horrible about it.

291
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:05,852
No, stop. Okay? I just--
I don't think I can hear the words right now.

292
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:08,729
It's my fault.
I haven't been stepping up to the plate.

293
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:12,275
- I need you to be strong.
- I can be stronger. I'll double my workouts.

294
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:15,319
Devon, stop it.
Chuck is in trouble with the CIA.

295
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,238
- What?
- Chuck.

296
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,447
Our Chuck...

297
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:23,035
...punched a CIA agent in the face today
and they are holding him right now.

298
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:24,745
You haven't been cheating on me?

299
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:29,041
What? Devon, what are you talking about?
No, listen. I think he's gonna need a lawyer.

300
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:31,711
No, no.
Chuck has been with the CIA for years.

301
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:36,549
I'm so glad you finally know.
What a relief it is to talk.

302
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,052
You don't know.

303
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:44,182
Oh, no. I just told you.

304
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:48,561
You are gonna tell me everything you know.
Right now.

305
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:54,775
Sure.

306
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,989
- Alex.
- Come here for the pie too, Colonel Casey?

307
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,618
- I think it's the best in town.
- There you are.

308
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:04,994
And you brought a friend.

309
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:08,122
- Table for two, please.
- Right this way.

310
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:29,101
Mosley, you're
needed in the conference room, ASAP.

311
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:30,353
That means run.

312
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,779
Follow you where, Dad?

313
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,707
Chuck.

314
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,296
Here you go.

315
00:20:57,464 --> 00:21:00,549
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome. Enjoy.

316
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:04,345
- Pretty girl. So much to live for.
- Mm.

317
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,598
Be a shame if she didn't.

318
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:10,935
Not hungry?

319
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:14,438
Why don't you put your hands
on the table, John?

320
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,404
Good.

321
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,200
Mm.

322
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,454
Too much nutmeg.

323
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:34,250
You're a smart guy, John.
I'm sure you figured it out by now.

324
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:37,753
You're coming with me.
I gotta say, John...

325
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:40,006
...I never figured you for a dad.

326
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,966
Well, I'm not a very good one.

327
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:49,390
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life.

328
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:58,274
Chuck? Wait. Where are you going?

329
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:01,777
- Sarah. I have to leave. My dad is coming.
- You can't. Stay and fight.

330
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:05,406
If you run, they'll put a burn notice on you
and you'll be running forever.

331
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,200
We have to move. Right now.

332
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,703
If you run
there's a bull's-eye on your back.

333
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,830
They will never,
ever stop looking for you.

334
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,790
Everyone you love will be in danger.

335
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,918
- Who do you wanna protect? You or her?
- Dad, please, don't make--

336
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:25,509
Right now, Charles.
You have to run to protect her.

337
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,845
I'm sorry, Sarah. I'm sorry.

338
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:31,265
But if I have to choose,
I will always choose to protect you.

339
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,950
Sorry, Alex.
But this is for your own safety.

340
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:52,953
You have to believe
I would never hurt you.

341
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:56,540
No, just forcibly kidnap me.

342
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:03,130
Take it. This is the key to my locker
at the Burbank Buy More.

343
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:06,050
Everything inside is yours now.

344
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,721
Look, Mr. Casey,
if you want me to hear you...

345
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,140
...let's step out of the car and talk...

346
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:16,310
...so that I don't feel
like my life is in jeopardy.

347
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,105
Please.

348
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,069
- Okay.
- Okay.

349
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,034
Alex. Wait, wait, wait!

350
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:34,328
- No, no, no. Wait!
- Unh!

351
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,126
I got an A in my self-defense class.

352
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:42,670
Oh. Alex.

353
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:45,339
Alex, I'm your father.

354
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:49,718
That's impossible.

355
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:52,471
My father's dead. He was a war hero.

356
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:55,349
- He died before I was even born.
- No, I didn't.

357
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:56,934
Stop it.

358
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,437
You were named after your dad, Alex.

359
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,689
You're named after me.

360
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,025
My real name's Alex Coburn.

361
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,698
Please. You have to trust me.

362
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:13,492
You have to get to your mom
and disappear.

363
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,870
Go, Alex. Run!

364
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:28,090
CIA! John Casey,
put your hands on top of your head.

365
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:34,555
The whole generalissimo thing?

366
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,390
I was undercover on a mission.

367
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,184
That's it. That's all I know, babe.

368
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:41,395
Oh, and you can blame the CIA
for my bachelor party.

369
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:43,522
Stripper? She was an agent.

370
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:46,400
Told you I didn't cheat. Faithful.

371
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,320
I can't believe that my brother
and Sarah are spies.

372
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,697
How is my dad involved in all this?

373
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:55,075
I, uh, have pockets of missing knowledge.

374
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:58,579
I didn't wanna know
because I didn't wanna lie to you, babe.

375
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:01,373
Devon, an actual,
legitimate answer exists...

376
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:03,876
...why my father has been missing
my entire life...

377
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,921
...and you didn't think
to ask that question?

378
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:10,132
- Correct.
- You need to find me somebody...

379
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,885
...who knows a lot more than you do.
Right now.

380
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:18,807
Morgan Grimes. The boy that took
my pillow as his date to junior prom...

381
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:21,185
...knows more about my family than I do.

382
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:25,814
Here. It's valerian root tea and it'll
give your brain a lovely soothing bath.

383
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:29,360
I don't want a soothing brain bath, Morgan.
I want answers.

384
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,862
Startling revelation. Yeah. I know.

385
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,282
Well, uh, Chuck has been with the company
for quite a while now.

386
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:39,286
Suffice to say, all is in hand, so...

387
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:41,622
No, Morgan. All is not in hand. Okay?

388
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,165
The bad guys have my brother.

389
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,459
Hold on.
Nobody said anything about bad guys.

390
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:48,045
- What bad guys? The Ring?
- What?

391
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:51,215
The Ring. A criminal organization
hell-bent on world domination.

392
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,552
All I know is that Justin told me
that John Casey is a double agent.

393
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,429
He's here to gather information
about my dad.

394
00:25:57,597 --> 00:26:01,225
But if Chuck is an agent too
then maybe Casey lied to him...

395
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,060
...and turned him somehow?

396
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:05,854
Our Eagle Scout? Chuck?
Turned? To the dark side?

397
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,064
No. Not gonna happen.

398
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,942
And any suggestions that
Colonel Jonathan Casey's character...

399
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:14,238
...is in question, well, I would stake
my entire, albeit, okay, thin reputation...

400
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:18,409
...on the fact that he
is Uncle Sam's most faithful servant.

401
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:21,453
Fine. Then one of you geniuses
explain to me...

402
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:24,498
...why the CIA is holding my brother
against his will.

403
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,041
I don't know.

404
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:27,585
But I will find out.

405
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:34,592
You wanted to see me, sir?

406
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,928
I'd be remiss if I didn't tell you
you looked great, Walker.

407
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,556
- Love suits you, I guess.
- Shut up.

408
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,057
This is crap and you know it.

409
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:47,479
Only two people know what happened that
day in Paris. It's your word against mine.

410
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:50,274
Chuck saw what happened.
We know you tried to kill me.

411
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,901
But Chuck has become
an unreliable witness.

412
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:55,529
His mind has been compromised
by the Intersect.

413
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:59,116
And now that he's escaped,
he seems so guilty.

414
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:02,036
I'm sorry you had to learn
about his mental deterioration...

415
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:04,705
...in such a public forum.

416
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:07,625
Sad that he never told you
in a more intimate setting.

417
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:10,502
Sam.

418
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,175
Put your hands up
and walk out that door...

419
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:19,386
...and you're gonna tell the generals
what happened in Paris.

420
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,972
- So move it.
- I knew you'd bite.

421
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,977
Drop it, Agent Walker.

422
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,897
Arrest her. She's gone rogue.

423
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:32,858
It's a shame.

424
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:35,444
I remember when nothing affected you.

425
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:38,405
Now you're as emotional
as your boyfriend.

426
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,877
Sarah and Casey will help Chuck.
You check the dojo.

427
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,754
There's a dojo?

428
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:58,092
- General Beckman?
- Where's Bartowski?

429
00:27:58,259 --> 00:27:59,718
I hoped to find him in Castle.

430
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:03,097
There's been some sort of mix-up.
Chuck is being held by the CIA.

431
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:04,848
You could clear this up. Great.

432
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:06,600
General Beckman, open the door.

433
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,977
- General, what's happening?
- Open the door, now.

434
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:12,106
They're shutting down the Intersect Project,
including myself.

435
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:15,859
They apprehended Colonel Casey.
Agent Walker is in custody.

436
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:18,112
Bartowski escaped this facility.

437
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:20,614
He is a wanted man.
I need you to find him.

438
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:24,076
As much as it pains me to admit,
you are our only hope.

439
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:26,954
You are our only hope.

440
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:33,335
Get your hands off--

441
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:40,050
Dude, did she mean you or me?

442
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,102
Finished it.

443
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:52,855
Your Governor.

444
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:04,992
It will activate immediately.

445
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,372
Better?

446
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:12,249
Yeah.

447
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:14,710
Yeah. Thanks.

448
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:21,216
Cell? That's not off the grid, Charles.

449
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:23,886
Dad, it's Morgan.
I never got a chance to say goodbye.

450
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:27,973
Hey, buddy. Listen, I gotta go away,
I gotta go on a trip with my dad.

451
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,725
I could be gone for a long time.

452
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,727
Yeah. Stop. Sarah is in CIA custody.

453
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,562
Casey has been taken. Beckman too.

454
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,230
What? When did this hap--? What?

455
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:37,399
Wait! Dad! Dad!

456
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,693
Dad, we have to go back.
Shaw has got Sarah.

457
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:43,697
And that's no accident. He doesn't
want her. He's trying to trap you.

458
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,866
He's after this.

459
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,243
I'm your father. You cannot ask me.

460
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:51,121
Please do not ask me
to put my own son in jeopardy.

461
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:54,208
I can't just walk away, Dad.

462
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:58,462
Why did you come back? You came back
because you wanted to protect Ellie and me.

463
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:01,882
Because you knew
you could never live with yourself...

464
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,843
...if something happened
to somebody that you loved.

465
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:11,475
If we do this...

466
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:16,480
...we gotta be smart.
Not think emotionally.

467
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:19,441
We can do this.

468
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:20,859
We're Bartowskis.

469
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,079
Ellie.

470
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,749
Chuck,
I thought that the CIA still had you.

471
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:38,168
- I wish I had time to explain.
- You know what...

472
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:42,005
...it takes just as long to say that
as to tell me what the hell is going on.

473
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,215
We need your help.

474
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:46,176
Who is "we," Chuck?
The government? The answer is no.

475
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:48,929
No. We need your help.

476
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:51,306
Dad?

477
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:53,267
I thought that you left.

478
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:55,686
Look, El,
I know you got a lot of questions...

479
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:59,189
...but right now,
you have the answers that we need.

480
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:04,194
This is it.
This is where I would meet Justin.

481
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,363
This is our rendezvous point.

482
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,074
There's gotta be more to it.

483
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:11,785
Shaw has to have another location,
can't be a dead end.

484
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:14,580
What are you two whispering about?
No more secrets.

485
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,331
You're forgetting something.

486
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:19,126
Walk us through what would happen
when you met Justin.

487
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:22,629
I don't know, Dad, this is it.
I'd sit on this bench and we would talk.

488
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:26,133
And then he'd get up. He'd leave.
He'd go over there.

489
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:27,885
Through that door.

490
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,261
The subway again.

491
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:36,226
We need you to stay here, okay?
You just stay right here, on this bench.

492
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:39,396
If we're not back in 20 minutes, run.

493
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,357
I need to hear you say it.

494
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:45,360
I need to know that there's a reason
that you left us.

495
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:50,324
It's a long story.

496
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:54,494
I wanna tell you everything,
but I gotta take care of this first, okay?

497
00:31:57,457 --> 00:32:01,168
This is the last time I'm gonna walk away
from you.

498
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,671
I promise.

499
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,506
I love you, baby.

500
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:19,728
You're not gonna get away
with this, Shaw.

501
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:21,355
Yes, I will.

502
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:25,400
Love-struck Bartowski will try to come
save you and this time I'll be ready for him.

503
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:27,027
And his father.

504
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,869
Over here. Over here.

505
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:43,669
Dad.

506
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,718
This control panel was manufactured
by McTiernan Industries.

507
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:53,929
It's a Ring subsidiary.

508
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:03,855
Fake wall.

509
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:05,357
Aces, Charles.

510
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,157
All right.

511
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,628
Shaw, Bartowski's infiltrated the base.

512
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,130
Of course he did.

513
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:31,591
Why won't your boyfriend ever think
with an organ besides his heart?

514
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,885
Ahem. No, sir. Not this one.

515
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:37,139
Bartowski and his father
found the other base. The Ring base.

516
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:39,433
Triggered the silent alarm.

517
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,311
Damn it.

518
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,274
Hmm.

519
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:50,694
Don't know when it happened
but our boy became a man.

520
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:53,447
Bartowski's a spy.

521
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,950
Picked a good one, Walker.

522
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:59,286
Finally.

523
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:06,251
Oh, my God.

524
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:11,923
This is what I've
been having dreams about.

525
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:15,343
Dr. Kowambe's medical experiments,
cellular regeneration.

526
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,558
It's identical. They did it.

527
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,977
I can't believe The Ring built one.

528
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,563
They must have saved Shaw's life.

529
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:31,151
And then turned him into an Intersect.
I was right.

530
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:50,087
The lab is the proof. It'll vindicate my team,
Shaw will be exposed--

531
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:53,215
Exposed? Exposed as what?
Uh, the Intersect?

532
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,886
I see you got a fancy new watch there,
Chuck.

533
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,721
Do you mind if I try it on?

534
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:05,852
Why don't you come over here
and take it?

535
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,022
Actually, I think I'll have my friend
grab it for me.

536
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:23,912
I don't need a watch to beat you, Shaw.

537
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:26,540
Come on, aren't you a little curious?

538
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,750
I know I am.

539
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:32,295
Don't you wanna know how your Intersect
stacks up against mine?

540
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,632
You're right, Chuck.
The fight will be incredible.

541
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,426
We're totally equal now.
Nothing separates us.

542
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:43,723
Though, there's one thing
that is different.

543
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:48,061
You can't function when your emotions
have been compromised.

544
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:50,355
Don't worry about that.

545
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:52,649
I've never been more calm.

546
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,068
Really? How you feeling now?

547
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:08,832
No!

548
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,672
Dad. Dad. Dad.

549
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,675
Dad. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hang on. Hang on.

550
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:21,761
Hang on. Stay with me.
Stay with me. You're gonna be okay.

551
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:23,597
I promise.

552
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,308
You're special, son.

553
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,436
Always remember.

554
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:32,439
Unh. You're special.

555
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,500
Check out the fresh fish.

556
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:35,669
Wait here.

557
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:38,838
Hello, miss.

558
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:40,382
- Hi.
- Hi.

559
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:43,802
I was wondering if I could service you
in some way?

560
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:46,471
Yes. I guess.

561
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:49,432
Um, could you tell me
where I could find John Casey's locker?

562
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:53,645
What exactly is your relationship
to Mr. Casey, if I may be so bold?

563
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:56,564
He's my friend.

564
00:37:56,732 --> 00:38:00,360
And he asked me to get something
out of his locker.

565
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:03,196
- He gave me his key.
- That doesn't look like one of our keys.

566
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:06,074
Shh. Maybe you're talking about
a different John Casey.

567
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,159
Ours doesn't really have any friends.

568
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:11,121
I'll take it from here.
Morgan Grimes, assistant manager.

569
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,999
- Hi. Alex.
- Alex. Take a walk with me?

570
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:17,002
- Did you say that belongs to John Casey?
- Yes.

571
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:19,587
- Um, he does work here, right?
- Of course he does. Yeah.

572
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:21,214
Who do you work for?

573
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,383
It's okay. You can tell me.
I'm on the inside.

574
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:26,386
- Um, the Pie Shack in Silverlake.
- Ha, ha. Yeah. Okay.

575
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:28,930
Come on.
I have a very high level of clearance.

576
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:32,267
You can't have access to his locker
without knowing what's going on.

577
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:34,519
I'm sorry. My hands are tied.

578
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:39,149
I don't know what's going on.
All I know is that this customer, John...

579
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,609
...kidnaps me
and then tells me he's my father.

580
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:45,822
And now, there's men chasing us.
I'm sorry, I know I don't really know you.

581
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,824
I'm just a little confused right now.

582
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,201
No. It's okay.
I didn't mean to make you upset.

583
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,412
Look, miss, I promise you this...

584
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,123
...if John Casey said he's your father,
it's the truth.

585
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:58,793
I trust that man. You have nothing
to be afraid of. Not if he's your father.

586
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:01,087
In fact, this store is as safe as anywhere.

587
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:04,049
Provided you stay away from those two.

588
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:11,639
Yeah? Let's go see what's in that locker,
all right? You okay? Yeah.

589
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:14,476
This isn't a Buy More key,
so I'll have to use mine.

590
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:19,272
Assistant manager.
That's why I have this. So you know.

591
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:27,405
Okay. Avid reader. Heh.

592
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:31,534
Oh, my. Whoa.

593
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:33,661
How long that's been in there? Yeah.

594
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:35,914
Oh, check it out.

595
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,541
Think that's gonna work.

596
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:43,171
Oh, actually, you might wanna stand back.
This could explode.

597
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:47,675
Mm... Okay.

598
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,935
- He said this was for you?
- Yeah. What is it?

599
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:05,193
He must have been saving for, like, ever.
Heh. We don't pay that much here.

600
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,154
Morgan. Ellie called.

601
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:09,572
We need to talk.

602
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:13,493
Shoot. Whatever you gotta say, you can say
in front of her. She's one of us.

603
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,412
Not this.

604
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,835
Try not to spend it all in one place.

605
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:28,550
Chuck, what happened?

606
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,636
Are you okay?

607
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:35,181
Where's your dad?

608
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:38,059
I'm sorry, guys.

609
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:41,104
Shaw has won.

610
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,649
Oh, my God.

611
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,776
I'm so sorry.

612
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,862
Don't worry, buddy. We'll get Shaw.

613
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,699
No, we won't.

614
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:55,493
Love the new defeatist attitude, Chuck.
It suits you.

615
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:59,080
We'll be leaving momentarily
for the CIA detention facility.

616
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:02,375
These people won't be seeing
the light of day for some time.

617
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:14,179
Enjoy this ride together.
Bond. Share old war stories.

618
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:15,805
Because as soon as the truck stops...

619
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:19,517
...so do your lives.

620
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:38,703
We'll figure something out.

621
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,080
It's over.

622
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:45,126
And there's no one left to save us.

623
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:57,472
I'm following them now. Are you ready?

624
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,973
We're ready.

625
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:02,435
I'm warning you, Ellie,
if we do this, there is no turning back.

626
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,312
Our lives are changed forever.

627
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,356
I'm asking one final time.

628
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:08,942
Are you sure this is what you want?

629
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,027
Yes.

630
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,450
Let's do this.
