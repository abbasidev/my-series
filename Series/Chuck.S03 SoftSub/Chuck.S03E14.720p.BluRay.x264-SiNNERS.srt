1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:04,461
Hi, I'm Chuck.
Here's a few things you need to know.

2
00:00:04,629 --> 00:00:06,797
This is General Beckman of the NSA.

3
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:12,511
I am calling to say that you are officially
a member of Operation Bartowski.

4
00:00:12,762 --> 00:00:15,806
- We need a few more days in Paris.
- No, I want you back ASAP.

5
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:55,554
Compartment service.

6
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,348
- So sorry to bother you.
- Right. I'll take it from here.

7
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:02,019
But wait, uh,
wouldn't you prefer for me to carve?

8
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,980
- I'm pretty good with knives.
- Ah. Will there be anything else?

9
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:07,483
Actually, you know what?
I think we have everything we need.

10
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,776
Ah. Very good, monsieur.

11
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,214
Good afternoon yet again, monsieur.

12
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:34,384
You do know, we have a full dining car
at the rear of the train.

13
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,346
Yes, uh, we just-- We quite like it in here.

14
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,223
So, ha, ha... Okay.

15
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:42,518
Hey. Ha, ha.

16
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:45,354
So you really don't have a favorite band?

17
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:47,856
I don't-- Everybody's got a favorite band.

18
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,025
What's your favorite live show?

19
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:53,821
- Music hasn't been at the top of my list.
- Oh, is that--?

20
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:00,577
Okay, music.
Something that we can work on.

21
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,539
Although that would require us
leaving this compartment.

22
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:06,083
- And I'm not sure how I feel about that.
- No.

23
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,292
All right. No.

24
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,588
Why? Why?

25
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,134
Oh.

26
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,761
Beckman expected us
back in Burbank today.

27
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:19,972
So did Ellie and Casey and Devon.

28
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,641
We can't just run away like this.

29
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:25,394
- Why not?
- Chuck.

30
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:28,480
Casey's been reinstated.
Ellie and Awesome are going to Africa.

31
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:31,275
Everyone else
is moving forward with their life.

32
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:35,279
Sarah, for the first time since I've
known you, nothing is holding us back.

33
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,157
And if Beckman finds out,
she could stop all of this.

34
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,075
Us.

35
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,910
I can't risk that. I won't.

36
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:45,581
You're right.
I can't go back to how it was before.

37
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,499
Before this. Before you.

38
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,922
We should do what I should've done
in Prague. We should run.

39
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,091
But, Chuck, is that what you really want?

40
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,093
I want you.

41
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,514
Sarah Walker, do you agree
to quit the spy life with me?

42
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:06,602
I do.

43
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:09,438
Chuck, do you agree
to quit the spy life with me?

44
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:10,772
I do.

45
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:21,909
Agents Walker and Bartowski haven't
checked in since the Shaw incident.

46
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:24,536
They were to report back here
at 0800 today.

47
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:28,624
As far as the U.S. government
is concerned, they're AWOL.

48
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,710
We'll need access
to Interpol sat imaging. Our uplinks--

49
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,629
We've been down that path, colonel.

50
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:39,009
I'm coming to you because
you have access to a unique resource.

51
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,886
Hmm.

52
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:46,642
The Intersect and Mr. Grimes
have an oddly co-dependent relationship.

53
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:50,562
I need to know if they're in communication.
Use him to find Chuck.

54
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:59,363
Devon, what are these?

55
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,657
Babe, this didn't happen by accident.

56
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:05,494
Okay, well,
they're not coming with us to Africa.

57
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,666
Don't worry, babe.

58
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,168
I'm sure Chuck will be
at our going-away party.

59
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,670
It's fine. It's fine.

60
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:17,756
If he shows up, he shows up.
If he doesn't...

61
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:21,843
...I'm sure whatever he's doing
at Buy More Corporate is very important.

62
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:35,357
Well, I see you finally made it out
of your compartment, Mr. and Mrs...?

63
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:37,401
Charles Carmi-- Charles. Ahem.

64
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:39,361
Charles Charles is the name.

65
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,779
We are the Charleses.

66
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,907
The Charles-ezez?
We're on our honeymoon.

67
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:45,200
Ah.

68
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,451
Mrs. Charles.

69
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:49,955
Enjoy.

70
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,543
I blew that cover story, didn't I?

71
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,421
I think the honeymoon bit
might've been too much. Was it?

72
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,048
I should've just said
we were dating exclusively.

73
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:04,094
- That's a fair assumption.
- Chuck, we're running away together.

74
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:09,224
Man, pastries for breakfast
every morning.

75
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:13,270
Europe is genius.
You're probably used to this stuff, right?

76
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:15,564
I may have a lot of stamps
in my passport...

77
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:19,067
...but I think this is the first time
I'm actually seeing the place.

78
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,903
Well, where do we begin?

79
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:24,239
We can go anywhere,
be anyone, do anything.

80
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:27,117
Well, we could go skiing in the Alps.

81
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,749
It could be painful.

82
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:37,169
Although we could also catch
a bunch of great concerts.

83
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,420
Could be fun.

84
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:43,091
And, uh, if we get tired of Europe,
there is always Canada.

85
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:47,763
No matter where we go or what we do.

86
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,849
As long as we're together, right?

87
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:59,066
Raspberry. Chocolate chips.

88
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,503
Charge this to Compartment 47.

89
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,882
- To not being spies.
- To not being spies.

90
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,638
Casey, I haven't heard from Chuck...

91
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,849
...and he hasn't updated
his Facebook status...

92
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,518
...which I can only assume means,
well, that he's--

93
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:19,354
Probably on something important.
Cut the man some slack.

94
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,648
He's got the world's fate
resting in his hands.

95
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:24,192
Oh, I'd say he's got something else
resting in his hands.

96
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,778
- What do you mean?
- Chuck's off-grid with Walker.

97
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,655
Do the math, Grimes.

98
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:32,534
He's going to need a walker
when Walker's through with him.

99
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,870
- They're having intercourse, idiot.
- Oh. Oh.

100
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,371
Gotcha. Say no more.

101
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,874
Good for Chuck.
Shouldn't be hard to find them.

102
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,542
And, yes, I will assist you.

103
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,544
I happen to be the Intersect of Chuck.

104
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,546
Hey, you seen Chuck?

105
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,923
I was just gonna ask you the same thing.

106
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:49,551
So where's Chuck?

107
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,970
You are on a need-to-know basis.

108
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,555
Dude.

109
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:57,642
Well, good thing you came to me,
as I have been tasked to bring him back.

110
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,061
- So...
- Back? Back from where?

111
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,856
- Well, probably better you don't know.
- Whatever.

112
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,984
- But you know the party tomorrow?
- Yeah, sure.

113
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:09,571
No matter what, it will kill her
if Chuck's not there to say goodbye...

114
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:10,739
...so make it happen.

115
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,658
Somebody say bat mitzvah? Hey.

116
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,785
No. Party.

117
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:20,081
You know, there's a lengthy Hebrew
translation I'm not gonna get into, nope.

118
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:21,708
In the olden days, bat mitzvah meant:

119
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:25,170
"Party hard because your daughter's
almost ripe for plucking."

120
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:29,257
- Oh, my.
- I miss the olden days.

121
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,885
Gonna assume our invitations
got lost in the mail.

122
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,595
Jeffster...

123
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,597
...formally accepts.

124
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:36,932
Holla.

125
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:40,894
Our manager,
by which I mean me, will be in touch.

126
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,442
I can't believe it.

127
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,028
We're really out of the spy game.

128
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,363
Yeah.

129
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:55,700
Yeah, it's gonna be tough
to just turn off this old head of mine.

130
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:56,910
I know what you mean.

131
00:08:57,078 --> 00:09:00,038
It's kind of second nature.

132
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,627
So, theoretically,
if I were to flash, I'd just ignore it.

133
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:08,129
- That's what we decided, right?
- Right.

134
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,924
Right, just a couple
of regular people blending in.

135
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:16,096
Just a couple of regular people
doing regular things.

136
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:19,933
Nothing heroic.

137
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,851
Exactly.

138
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,230
Because that's what you wanted, right?

139
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,734
Of course.

140
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:46,793
- I'll go and get some fresh air.
- I'm gonna get some ice cream.

141
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,420
- Wanna get it?
- You can get it.

142
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,754
I'll get fresh air here.

143
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,923
- Good.
- Yeah, I'll just open the window.

144
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:55,260
Nothing like some nice Swiss air
to get the blood pumping...

145
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,469
...you know what I mean?

146
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,513
Oh! Oh! Oh, that's cold.

147
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,348
That is brisk, but refreshing.

148
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,183
Uh, I'll be right back.

149
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,768
Ah.

150
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,272
Perfect.

151
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,673
Juan Diego Arnaldo.

152
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,842
He's a Basque terrorist.

153
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,970
Codes, dates.
What on earth are they planning?

154
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,142
Oh, damn it.

155
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,166
Names, dates. What are they up to?

156
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:23,848
God.

157
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:37,987
Come on.

158
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,913
What are y'all doing in my room?

159
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:50,125
My husband is gonna kick your behinds.

160
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,504
This is my compartment...

161
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:58,091
...though I'd be happy to show you
to wherever you are going.

162
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,801
Oh, ha, ha.

163
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,428
I'm so embarrassed.

164
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,474
All of these rooms
look the same six drinks in.

165
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,811
We do everything big in Texas.

166
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:13,064
- I can see that.
- Right, well, I'll be on my way.

167
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,135
Whoa!

168
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:50,685
Just doing some calisthenics.
Can't let myself go now that I got the girl.

169
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,145
Right.

170
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:59,611
Oh, yeah.

171
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,790
You know, Chuck, I can't fake this.

172
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,333
Not with you.

173
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:14,876
What?

174
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:18,296
- You've been faking it the whole time?
- No, no, no. Not that.

175
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,215
I spotted a Basque terrorist on board.

176
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:21,716
- Juan--
- Diego Arnaldo.

177
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,719
I flashed on him. He has
a whole list of names in his room.

178
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,388
All of his contacts
from the Euskadi Ta Askatasuna.

179
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,891
My God, you even make
terrorist groups sound sexy.

180
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,101
So you were the one I was hiding from.

181
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,021
You were the one in the bathroom?

182
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,193
You know,
Juan Diego Arnaldo is a terrorist.

183
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,904
After all, it would be irresponsible--

184
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,657
Even criminal to turn our backs on him.

185
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:47,992
One last mission before we quit?

186
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,912
One last mission.

187
00:13:57,294 --> 00:14:00,213
Let me get this straight.
Last time you saw Chuck was in Paris?

188
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,589
- Quiet.
- What--?

189
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:05,718
- Hey, you asked me for my help.
- I was tasked to ask for your help.

190
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,929
- There's a big difference.
- Tomato, tomato.

191
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,890
You're looking for a needle
in a haystack made of needles.

192
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:13,601
You need to create an advantage.
That's me.

193
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:17,272
You know, it can take up to seven
minutes to strangle someone to death.

194
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:20,650
- I've done it in under 30 seconds.
- Wow.

195
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:23,570
See, I thought John Casey
wasn't scared of anything.

196
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:28,116
- I'm not.
- Why are you scared to ask for my help?

197
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,745
- Go.
- All right.

198
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:35,290
Looks like we have
an Oracle-based system here.

199
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:36,541
Okay.

200
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,252
I've been studying this subject
for over 20 years.

201
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,546
- I think I know a thing or two.
- Mm-hm.

202
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:44,757
I noticed Chuck left behind
his eczema moisturizing cream...

203
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,759
...which he needs a prescription for.

204
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:49,345
And Dr. Feldman, our dermatologist...

205
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:53,349
...would have had to call in
to a pharmacy like this one.

206
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,644
Montparnasse. Near the train station.

207
00:14:56,854 --> 00:15:00,231
Ah. Let me see if I can find out
what day he picked it up.

208
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,483
Okay, April 15th.

209
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:06,154
So let's cross-check that with
the train-station security camera footage.

210
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:08,156
Oh, boy, this is gonna be tough.

211
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:11,159
Yeah, see, this is why
we leave the spy work to the spies.

212
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,119
Oh, no, no, no, not yet. Listen to me.

213
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,829
Chuck's a hardcore DC Comics guy...

214
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,916
...and not leaving Paris without
the latest issue of Justice League.

215
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:21,586
- What?
- Where is the nearest magazine stand?

216
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,756
There. There.

217
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,132
Bingo, huh? There he is.

218
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,926
There's our boy.

219
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,386
Now just see
if we can zoom in on the ticket.

220
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,263
Gotcha.

221
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,223
They're en route to Zurich.

222
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:39,979
Make sure your passport's up to date.
Pack light.

223
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:42,523
Wait a minute.

224
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:45,026
I'm traveling to Europe
on the government's dime?

225
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:48,404
Champagne, langostino,
fully reclining seats.

226
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:50,531
First class, here I come, baby.

227
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,209
Casey, I get nervous feelings when I fly.

228
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,710
Yeah. Big job ahead of us.

229
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:04,045
- Get some sleep.
- I can't.

230
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:08,132
See, in my head, the only way the plane
remains aloft is if I'm rooting for it.

231
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:12,136
So it stands to reason,
if I'm sleeping, I'm not rooting.

232
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,391
- I'm doing it for the passengers.
- Whatever, nut-job.

233
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:19,060
But you wake me,
you'll be the only one that dies.

234
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:30,029
If we can subdue Arnaldo and leave
them cuffed at the next station--

235
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:33,032
We can place an anonymous call
to Interpol to pick them up.

236
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,576
- Bad guys delivered.
- Day saved.

237
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:39,080
Then we can finally start
living our real lives together.

238
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,331
Right?

239
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,958
Right.

240
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,336
So, what's the plan?

241
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:48,172
We left all of our spy gear in Paris.

242
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,437
Oh, hey. Sorry, man. Ha, ha.

243
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:06,607
Ride on a train's a little bumpy,
you know, and I had a couple drinks.

244
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,192
Take it easy.

245
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:35,511
Well, they already know me
as a drunken newlywed.

246
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,638
It's about time
they met my handsome husband.

247
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:38,848
What do you say, tiger?

248
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:44,937
Well, I do believe you are correct,
Mrs. Charles.

249
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:54,113
Although I can't help feeling
like we're missing something.

250
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,784
Is all that really necessary?

251
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:01,579
- Every traveler should own a rucksack.
- What's with the stupid maple-leaf patch?

252
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,332
Every American also knows
to act Canadian as to be well-liked.

253
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,958
That's a cliché.

254
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,835
We're on a mission, not a vacation.

255
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,545
I'm sorry. I've never been to Europe.

256
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:11,506
I've barely been south
of Redondo Beach.

257
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,178
- Ticket, please.
- Oh, right. Sorry.

258
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,724
- What are you doing?
- Hold on. Don't worry.

259
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:24,435
My ticket
is in my super-secret money pouch.

260
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,313
There you go.

261
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:30,983
Trains and buses are hotbeds
for gypsy activity. Stay alert.

262
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,693
Thank you.

263
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,738
Check the sleeping compartments.
I'll get the dining car.

264
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,657
Copy that.

265
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,327
Whoa. Casey.

266
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,832
Up we go. Okay.

267
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,508
Oops. Sorry, sorry. Excuse me.

268
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,688
Oh, my God.

269
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,857
Hi, y'all. It's me.

270
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:12,733
Remember me? I was in y'all's room.

271
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,988
I don't suppose you would mind
taking a picture of me and my husband?

272
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,323
- It's our honeymoon.
- Yes, it is.

273
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:22,034
- Oh, dear.
- Oh! Oh, my God. I am so sorry.

274
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:24,912
Charlie, baby, look what I did.
I made an oopsie.

275
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,372
It's no problem, my dear.

276
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,333
- You only honeymoon once.
- This man speaks the truth.

277
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:33,337
Hey, but still, apologies, nonetheless.
I'm Mr. Charles. This is Mrs. Charles.

278
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,756
- We are the Charleses.
- The Charleseses. Ha, ha.

279
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:39,510
Well, Charlie Charles does not spill
a man's drink onto a man's cheese tray...

280
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,762
...and not buy a man another drink.

281
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:45,600
Why don't I get you some fresh ones,
and maybe another cheese tray to boot?

282
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:48,019
Oh, isn't he just a sweetheart?

283
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:50,521
I mean, doesn't that look delicious,
by the way?

284
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,357
I mean, that cheese...

285
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:59,530
Attention, Mr. and Mrs.
Whatever-Your-Last-Name-Is.

286
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,115
Why do they need a rehearsal?

287
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:04,452
Prepare yourself to be wowed
by a wall of sound.

288
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,913
Sound. Sound.

289
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,754
- What was that?
- You blew the amp.

290
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,215
It's not the size of the instrument
that matters...

291
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,675
...but how often your mother
catches you playing.

292
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:23,304
You know who can fix
that amp in two seconds?

293
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,472
Chuck.

294
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:28,309
- I really think you can handle it.
- No, we need Chuck.

295
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,061
We don't need Chuck, okay?

296
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,482
Sorry. We're just--

297
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,235
We're gonna figure
something else out, okay?

298
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,823
Go get our turtlenecks.

299
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:48,704
Tonight, Jeffster goes unplugged.

300
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,831
Um, Lester, that's lime juice.

301
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,711
Enjoy your rest.

302
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:57,713
Try this one. It is just delightful.

303
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:59,674
Here we are.
Sorry about the inconvenience.

304
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:02,593
There's your three fresh
beverages for you gentlemen.

305
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:06,472
Now, if you don't mind, I'm gonna
steal my pretty little wife back from you.

306
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,848
It's been a speck of time...

307
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:10,768
...since I whispered
sweet nothings into my gal's ear.

308
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,520
Come on now. She is a tigress.

309
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:15,022
A tigress. She just comes at you.
Come on, baby.

310
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,649
- Let's go have some fun.
- Bye.

311
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,026
Y'all have a good trip now. Okay.

312
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,363
Well, I-- Cheers.

313
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,868
You know, uh,
I know this is our last mission...

314
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:30,496
...but we make a great team,
Mrs. Charles.

315
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:34,041
I'm thinking the same thing, Mr. Charles.

316
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,212
Oh, God.

317
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,052
- Casey?
- What are you doing here?

318
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,596
Putting to rest any stupid ideas
you two might have...

319
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:51,017
...of turning this
into a permanent vacation.

320
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,352
I realize how this must look right now...

321
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,355
...but what you are unaware of
is we're on a mission, okay?

322
00:21:56,523 --> 00:22:00,401
Behind you at the end of the dining car
are members of the Basque ETA.

323
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:09,410
Those drunk guys?
Yeah, they look real threatening.

324
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,586
Casey, what are you doing?
You don't understand. He's getting away.

325
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:21,505
What kind of a chump
do you take me for, anyway?

326
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,591
Sorry.

327
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,217
- Come on.
- Coming. Coming.

328
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,011
Not so fast. Wrist, wrist.

329
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,387
Okay, go, go, go.

330
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,223
Oh, whoa.

331
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:32,767
Excuse me.

332
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:40,232
Excuse me. Are you Canadian?

333
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:43,444
Me too, eh.

334
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:46,947
Sorry to bother you.
Have you seen my friend?

335
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:50,701
- He's about--
- Stay away from me or I'll cut you.

336
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,581
Not such a passive people after all.

337
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:04,715
- I'll go first.
- You know, maybe I should--

338
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:08,636
Shoot. Sarah, I'm stuck.

339
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:13,265
- Sarah, are you okay?
- Hold on, Chuck. I've got it.

340
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:20,064
Ha, ha. I just got locked out. That's all.

341
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:26,320
Hi there. Lovely scarf.

342
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,662
Whoa!

343
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:38,582
Chuck, get off me.

344
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,000
Terrorist, huh?

345
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:43,003
Two spies could come up
with a better excuse than that.

346
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:44,338
Casey, he's here, okay?

347
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,966
He's in the bathroom. I swear to you.

348
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:54,473
Hi.

349
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,853
All right, let's say I believe you now.

350
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,772
Would you explain to me
what the hell is going on?

351
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,701
Hey. Hey!

352
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:15,035
Go.

353
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,710
Grimes, get out of the way.

354
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,883
That was awesome. Did you see that hit?

355
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,718
Guys.

356
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,223
- If you're going to kill me, just do it.
- We're not.

357
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,350
Yeah, we're CIA, dirtbag.

358
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,229
Morgan, not the best idea to share
that information with just anyone.

359
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:46,400
If you're CIA, then why did you
take out the Interpol agents on the train?

360
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:51,864
- Wait, those weren't your men?
- Interpol already apprehended you?

361
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:55,576
No, Interpol was taking me
to a witness-protection program...

362
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:58,871
...in exchange for the names
of several key ETA leaders.

363
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,581
You turned yourself in?

364
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:03,709
I have been living on the run
for the last two years of my life.

365
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:06,086
I couldn't take it anymore.

366
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,631
Didn't you run this mission
through Beckman?

367
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:12,593
We wanted to do it, um, under the radar.

368
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,887
- Why?
- Because they're quitting.

369
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:18,557
What? No, no, no.
Wait, wait. Hold on a second, Chuck.

370
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:21,101
You can't just stop. Dude, you are a spy.

371
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:23,103
You're in the middle of a mission.

372
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:25,564
- Morgan, Sarah and I--
- We decided.

373
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:28,275
- We wanna be together.
- So this is it for us, okay?

374
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,111
Soon as we hand over Arnaldo,
we're quitting.

375
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,406
Hey.

376
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,867
Give me the cuffs.

377
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,875
It's Elia.

378
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:47,378
The Interpol agents are neutralized.

379
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,964
Someone did our job for us.

380
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:51,799
Meet me in Pündtün.

381
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:56,095
We'll make sure Arnaldo
and his new friends never talk.

382
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,813
Chuck, what were you thinking?

383
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:09,817
You apprehended Juan Diego Arnaldo
without contacting me first?

384
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,360
Well, yes, technically, but--

385
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,113
Your part in this little
impromptu mission is over.

386
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:17,658
I'll arrange for Arnaldo to be picked up
by a different Interpol team.

387
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,868
Try not to physically assault them.

388
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:23,372
General, we didn't hit them
or assault them in any way.

389
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:24,999
No physical altercation.

390
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:27,668
We just dosed them
with pharmaceutical-grade narcotics.

391
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:30,170
- Agent Bartowski.
- That's not making it better.

392
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:33,048
- How's she taking it?
- Really good, I think. Yeah.

393
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:36,885
All you need to do is keep Arnaldo
alive until the local team arrives.

394
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:39,054
- Think you can handle that?
- Absolutely.

395
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:43,934
Once Arnaldo is placed safely in Interpol
custody, return to Burbank immediately.

396
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:46,312
And you better have
a good explanation for your--

397
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:52,234
Agent Bartowski? Agent Bartowski.

398
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:55,070
General, general, please know
I'm not hanging up on you right now--

399
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:00,200
Well?

400
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:04,872
Well, we get to hang around here
for a little bit longer, so vaykay.

401
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:09,126
It's like the butter shot directly
from a Swiss cow into my mouth.

402
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,837
And, yet, I still can't enjoy it.

403
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:14,089
I can't believe you're just quitting.

404
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:17,593
- Walking away from everything.
- I'm not. I'm walking toward something.

405
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:20,471
I can't believe you were gonna leave
without saying goodbye to Ellie.

406
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,890
Ellie is going away.

407
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,767
To do something that she wants to do.

408
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:26,977
And I'm happy for her and Devon.

409
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,729
So that's it?

410
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:32,566
- Throwing away your life for Bartowski?
- I'm making a life.

411
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,652
I've been tasked to retrieve you two.

412
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:37,154
I know why you're here,
and we're not going back.

413
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:40,449
But you're a spy, man. This is the coolest
thing that's ever happened to us.

414
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:43,869
I know what it means
to make a choice like this.

415
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:46,664
I won't stop you.

416
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,501
- Thank you.
- Unless you want me to.

417
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:53,253
I thought this was everything
that you ever wanted.

418
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:56,590
It is, okay? It is. But I want Sarah more.

419
00:27:56,758 --> 00:28:00,010
Look, no matter how much
I wanna be a spy, I want Chuck more.

420
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:04,598
- May I interject?
- No.

421
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,976
So if I have to choose
between the two, I choose Sarah.

422
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:12,272
- Does it have to be a choice?
- I don't know... Excuse me.

423
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,817
Look, Sarah has been
a spy her entire life...

424
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:18,404
...and now she's willing to give up
everything to be with me, man.

425
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:20,447
- Me.
- Doesn't have to be all or nothing.

426
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:22,950
No, I can't risk it. This is what he wants.

427
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:25,494
And if this is what she wants...

428
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:28,956
...then I'm not gonna risk
losing her again.

429
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,416
Okay, fine.

430
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:31,834
Just do me this favor.

431
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:36,296
Before you quit, make damn sure
that quitting is what she wants.

432
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,720
All right, enough of this.

433
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:47,975
If you're gonna go, you'd better go now
before the other Interpol team gets here.

434
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,311
- Right now?
- Yeah.

435
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:53,647
We'll hand him over.

436
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,149
Well, I will.

437
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,652
Perhaps we should all share
some nut cake before you go.

438
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,195
Especially you two.

439
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:02,281
Open communication is very important.

440
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:04,324
Ah, shut up.

441
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,493
All right.

442
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:08,495
- Let's say goodbye, huh?
- Love you, man.

443
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:10,497
I love you too. I'll miss you.

444
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:12,708
- Thank you, Casey.
- Mm-hm.

445
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,335
Hey. Take care of my boy.

446
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,379
- I will.
- All right.

447
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,716
Move.

448
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:39,401
So kiss me and smile for me

449
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:43,947
Tell me that you'll wait for me

450
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:49,661
Hold me like you'll never let me go

451
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:56,919
'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane

452
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,295
Well, here we go.

453
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:01,590
Don't know when I'll be back again

454
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,469
I gotta say, it's really weird leaving.

455
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:10,057
I mean, I've never lived anywhere
outside of California before, so...

456
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:14,478
Well, I've lived all over the world,
but, uh...

457
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,939
...well, Burbank's the only place
that ever felt like home.

458
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:23,403
Oh, babe, I hate to go

459
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:28,951
I hate to go

460
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:41,171
- Nice job. All right.
- Thank you. Thank you.

461
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,799
Devon, Ellie, you wanna come up here
and say a few words?

462
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,426
Oh.

463
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:53,433
- Colonel John Casey.
- Agent Simon.

464
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:56,144
Agent Patino.
We heard there was a misunderstanding.

465
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:57,437
You could say that.

466
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:58,772
Hello. Ha, ha. Right here.

467
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,607
So impolite. M. Grimes.

468
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:02,609
Can't disclose what the M stands for.

469
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:05,279
So, yeah, yeah,
where you boys stationed nowadays?

470
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:07,197
- Lake Como.
- Is that right? Seriously?

471
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,324
Oh, I love Lake Como.

472
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:13,495
I've never actually been there myself,
but I read all about it.

473
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:14,788
Look, right here.

474
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:17,499
Yeah, paints quite the elegant portrait,
you know?

475
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,502
But it is still just a book, so, tell me...

476
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,504
...the Villa del Balbianello, is it--?

477
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:25,340
- Am I saying that right? Balbianello?
- It's beautiful.

478
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:27,718
- I can imagine. This time of year--
Grimes.

479
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,137
- Let them do their job.
- Naturally. Sure, sure.

480
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,890
There I go.
But one more question about Lake Como.

481
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,141
Sagra di San Giovanni.

482
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:37,227
Is it just everything I heard it was?
I mean, I--

483
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:39,104
The palaces are beautiful there.

484
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,856
Yeah--

485
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,065
Palaces?

486
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,692
We really should go.

487
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,820
Yeah, no. I've held you up enough.

488
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,822
I'll go on all day. Lake Como, Lake Como.

489
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,825
But Sagra di San Giovanni,
it's this festival of boats.

490
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:54,995
Supposed to be amazing,
dating back hundreds of years.

491
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,748
So I thought anyone who's spent
any amount of time in Lake Como...

492
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,167
...well, they'd probably know it.

493
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,840
- I don't recommend that.
- Oh, Canada.

494
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:10,135
Wouldn't want
to make a scene or a mess.

495
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:20,020
Well, after you, Agent Walker.

496
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:23,065
No longer an agent, right?

497
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:27,027
No longer Mr. Charles, either, I suppose.

498
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:39,206
Sarah, this is what you want, right?

499
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,375
To run away?

500
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:47,506
Well, I always thought
that it had to be one way or the other.

501
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,383
But maybe...

502
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,594
Maybe what? You can say it. It's okay.

503
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,098
Sorry to cut the honeymoon short...

504
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:59,559
...but what have you done
with Juan Diego Arnaldo?

505
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:07,734
Guys, guys, guys, please. Listen to me.

506
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:10,529
This is a giant misunderstanding.
We're on the same side.

507
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:12,322
Enough. You drugged us.

508
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:15,033
Interpol did send an additional
team to retrieve Arnaldo.

509
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,160
Oh, okay. Then I expect an apology.

510
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,913
They were just found dead
10 minutes outside of Pündtün.

511
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,832
Oh, my God. Morgan and Casey.

512
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,252
- Our friends are in big trouble right now.
- Well, our friends are dead.

513
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,671
And you're gonna tell us why.

514
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:31,842
- We can't leave them.
- I know.

515
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,136
If we're gonna do something,
we have to do it now.

516
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:36,013
Quiet.

517
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:44,730
- What are you doing?
- Looking for the keys.

518
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:47,065
No, we don't have time. We have to run.

519
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,109
Hold on.

520
00:33:57,452 --> 00:34:00,912
I want to know everything
you've told Interpol.

521
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,793
You should never have
abandoned your team.

522
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:11,757
Don't you have some signal to the CIA
to alert them that we're in danger?

523
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:15,385
The only CIA agents
within 100 miles of here just quit.

524
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:39,117
Just stay calm.

525
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:29,835
I can't hit a girl.

526
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,337
I can.

527
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:34,965
On your feet now. Hook arms.

528
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,550
Push, push, push. Go.

529
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:50,689
That was awesome.

530
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,401
Casey, are you all right?

531
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:57,988
Don't worry. I'll take care of this one.

532
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,782
Don't you two have a train to catch?

533
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,993
Uh, yeah. Yeah, we do.

534
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,996
- Right, Chuck?
- Right.

535
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,206
Right.

536
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:12,711
May I just say,
I've been on the run for two years.

537
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:16,423
And no matter how far you run,
you can never run from yourself.

538
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:19,843
And from what I've heard
from both of you...

539
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:22,888
...it's not what either of you really wants.

540
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:28,602
- You don't wanna quit?
- I thought that's what you wanted.

541
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:33,106
I don't want you to choose me over
something that you want for yourself.

542
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:36,067
I want you. I want us.

543
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,531
Do you think if we went back...

544
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:44,534
...and we told Beckman
the honest-to-God, absolute truth...

545
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:47,329
...you think we'd really have
a shot at having it all?

546
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:53,418
Chuck, do you agree to not quit
the spy life and be with me?

547
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:54,628
I do.

548
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:57,422
Sarah, do you agree to not quit
the spy life and be with me?

549
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,257
I do.

550
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:13,647
Good work, Colonel Casey.

551
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:17,192
Because of your efforts, a group
of Basque terrorists were captured.

552
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,695
Thank you, general. Uh, it wasn't just me.

553
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:24,783
Grimes here was resourceful
and quick to action when necessary.

554
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:28,703
An unlikely pair
often produces successful results.

555
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,664
Thank you. You're both dismissed.

556
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:35,293
Actually, uh, if I may
address you directly, general...

557
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:38,380
Wow, what a trip. Ha, ha.

558
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,382
And Chuck and Sarah, I know, I know.

559
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:45,845
They may have acted impulsively,
recklessly, foolishly, even, I don't know.

560
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:49,266
But I do know this,
these two were born to be spies.

561
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,809
Together.

562
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:52,435
- Get him out of here.
- Ma'am.

563
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,020
What?

564
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:58,733
Do either of you
have any type of explanation...

565
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:01,152
...for your extemporaneous holiday?

566
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,280
It was my fault.

567
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:06,825
I flashed and made Agent Walker
accompany me while pursuing a suspect.

568
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:10,662
I was following a hunch, and Chuck was
simply being a good partner.

569
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:13,206
- Do you both think me an idiot?
- No, ma'am.

570
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,458
Then don't lie to me.

571
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:21,339
General, look, I think it's important
you should know that Sarah and I--

572
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,425
We-- We--

573
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:27,512
Stop right there. Release Agent Walker.
I didn't ask. I don't need to know all the--

574
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:32,058
But I thought you said no more lies,
and we want to tell you the truth.

575
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:34,561
- No.
- General, Chuck and I are dating.

576
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,650
Exclusively.

577
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:46,448
I must caution you...

578
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:49,492
...that allowing your private life
to interfere...

579
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:53,455
...with your professional one
can be dangerous.

580
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:56,750
But off the record: It's about damn time.

581
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:11,681
Oh, my God.
I forgot that Ellie was leaving.

582
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:22,233
Ellie? Devon?

583
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:39,667
I've never asked Chuck for anything.

584
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:42,629
I just wanted a chance to say goodbye.

585
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:45,590
And he couldn't even give me that.

586
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:53,139
I just wanted a chance to say goodbye,
and he couldn't even--

587
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:54,474
Chuck.

588
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:58,353
Ellie.

589
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:02,857
I forgot my phone.
I think I still might be a little drunk.

590
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,026
I'm so sorry, Ellie. I wanted to be here.

591
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:06,528
Chuck, it's fine.

592
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:09,697
You missed one party.

593
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:15,412
Truth is, I think I got so drunk
because I was upset with myself.

594
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:19,124
I'm leaving my little brother.

595
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,252
I'm not so little anymore.

596
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:34,722
And, uh, just so you know...

597
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:38,268
...you're not leaving me alone.

598
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:44,941
You guys are back together?

599
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,360
We're together.

600
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,949
I think I found the one.

601
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,036
This is gonna be your favorite song.

602
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:02,041
Birds flying high
You know how I feel

603
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:08,715
The sun in the sky
You know how I feel

604
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:11,092
I like this.

605
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:14,554
Breeze drifting on by
You know how I feel

606
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,806
Well, it's a good start.

607
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:20,643
It's a new dawn, it's a new day

608
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:25,190
It's a new life for me, yeah

609
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:30,403
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life for me

610
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:38,161
And I'm feeling good

611
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:49,047
Fish in the sea
You know how I feel

612
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:55,428
River running free
You know how I feel

613
00:41:56,931 --> 00:42:01,893
Blossom on the tree
You know how I feel

614
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:07,732
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life

615
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:14,906
I'm feeling good
