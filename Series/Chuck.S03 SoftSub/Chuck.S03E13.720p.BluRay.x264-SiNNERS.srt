1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:04,753
I'm Chuck. Here's a few things
you might need to know.

2
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:07,673
- You're not the same guy I fell for.
- How am I not?

3
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:09,842
- You killed somebody.
- He didn't kill the mole.

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,886
- What?
- I did.

5
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:15,556
It's time you learnt the truth
about your wife's murder.

6
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:20,728
- No!
- If The Ring played him this...

7
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:24,523
- Oh, God, general, where is Sarah now?
- We believe she's with Agent Shaw.

8
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,567
Where are you taking us?

9
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:30,070
To settle an old score.

10
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:51,592
Okay, just give me 20 seconds.
Are you sure about this?

11
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:55,554
NSA picked up the Director's signal.
This is his broadcast point.

12
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,849
If they're right, The Ring's most
senior operative is behind that door.

13
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:05,814
Cover me.

14
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,237
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, where's Casey?

15
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:15,407
Haven't seen him. I've been thinking
about Operation Bartowski.

16
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:18,660
- I'd like to make it official.
- I'm in the middle of something--

17
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:21,163
Spyish? Let me help.
I wanna be part of the team.

18
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,290
Find Casey
and you're a part of the team.

19
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,084
Operation Bartowski?
I could actually--?

20
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,377
- Shh! Not so loud.
- Not so loud. Right.

21
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:30,714
Great. I could be your second
in command-slash-personal assistant.

22
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:34,968
Batman needs Alfred, Bond needs Q.
Chuck-- Hey, hey, hey. You need me.

23
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:38,222
- I need Casey right now.
- Per my excellent peripheral vision...

24
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:40,224
...which is a valuable spy skill...

25
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:43,852
...I can tell you that one John Casey
is now exiting the restroom.

26
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,689
- Oh, thank you. Great.
- You're welcome. Hey, hey.

27
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:50,150
- So I'm a spy? Official?
- Yes, you're a spy.

28
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,652
I am a spy.

29
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,622
Shaw?

30
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:08,418
- Walker killed Shaw's wife?
- Five years ago. It was her Red Test.

31
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:11,380
Sarah didn't know,
Beckman didn't know, but Shaw knows.

32
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:14,716
He and Sarah have disappeared.
They're off the grid. They're gone.

33
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:18,887
- You shouldn't be telling me any of this.
- But you know what to do, Casey.

34
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:21,265
Beckman told me to sit tight.
You know I can't.

35
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,395
Sarah activated her locator.
She's in trouble.

36
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:30,149
Come on, man.
You know how I feel about her.

37
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,571
Call this number.
Request tactical support.

38
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:37,990
You'll be forwarded
to a Colonel Sanders.

39
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:41,326
Don't make fun of his name.
You want air, armor, everything.

40
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,709
I love you.

41
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:58,051
Hi, baby. Happy birthday.

42
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:02,055
Okay, my turn. Give me the camera.

43
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,934
Stop it. I got it for your birthday.

44
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:09,980
I had no idea you were gonna use
my present against me.

45
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:11,690
Happy birthday.

46
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:15,319
I love you.

47
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,529
Oh, my God.

48
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:25,037
I love you.

49
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,390
One more time, just so we're clear.

50
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:48,518
We have to reacquire Agent Walker.
Nothing can happen to her.

51
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:51,480
- Do I make myself clear?
- Yes, sir.

52
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,649
This is Team Leader. Is everything set?

53
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:55,651
- Air is go.
- Mechanized is go.

54
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:58,612
- Tactical is go.
- Airborne is go.

55
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,155
All right, let's do this.

56
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,216
Shaw.

57
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,517
I'm going first.

58
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:34,231
Shaw, what is going on?

59
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:41,571
What is this? This is my Red Test.

60
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:45,158
Why would they have my surveillance
footage from my first kill?

61
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,369
Just take a breath.

62
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,497
This is the worst moment of my life
up there on that monitor.

63
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,251
I love you.

64
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,213
- Mine too.
- What?

65
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,424
Why? Who is she?

66
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:02,884
Evelyn Shaw.

67
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,723
I killed your wife?

68
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,600
They used you, they manipulated you.

69
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,771
The Ring was behind this.

70
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:17,024
- I killed your wife.
- This isn't your fault.

71
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:21,069
- I thought I was a good spy.
- This isn't your fault.

72
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,074
It's okay.

73
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:37,961
Is it secure?

74
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,465
Chuck?

75
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:43,300
Hi.

76
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,679
- Don't move!
- Go. Go.

77
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,015
- Get on the ground!
- Hold it.

78
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,309
- Around the perimeter.
- Perimeter covered.

79
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,895
- Got eyes on target.
- Hold your position.

80
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:57,564
What's happening? Is the target secure?

81
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:58,774
We're here.

82
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:01,651
This is Team Leader.
Cancel air support. Cancel tactical.

83
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,570
- Stand down.
- Stand down.

84
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,783
And the tank. The tank.
Cancel the tank.

85
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,123
Who on earth gave you the authority
to call in a full tactical assault?

86
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,292
I don't know what
to do, but you're not ready for Rome.

87
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,711
But, general, it was Sarah.
Come on, I had to--

88
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,256
Do you wanna see the bill
for your rescue mission?

89
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,508
It's longer than my copy of
Atlas Shrugged.

90
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,511
You and I both thought the worst.
That Shaw had gone rogue.

91
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,139
- That he was going to--
Kill Sarah?

92
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:17,602
Shaw. Sarah.

93
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:21,523
- Listen--
- You thought I'd betray my country?

94
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:26,319
General, Chuck's actions
were those of a true spy.

95
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:29,030
He was looking out for his partner
and the agency.

96
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,366
I would have done the same myself.

97
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:35,203
Maybe without the stealth bombers,
but perhaps that's just me.

98
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:39,124
- You doing okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you.

99
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,877
Thank you for saving me.

100
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,587
I appreciated the tank.

101
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,381
General, did you check Sarah's records?

102
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,550
Any clues as to who ordered
her Red Test?

103
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:52,679
I'm afraid, Sarah, Langston Graham
took that secret to his grave.

104
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,348
Okay, general,
then what are we supposed to do now?

105
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:59,686
We disband the team. You can't operate
as an effective unit with this history.

106
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:04,524
General, if I may, this isn't the first time
they've used one of our own against us.

107
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,527
I wanna make sure it's the last.

108
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:09,821
You're saying
you can work with Walker?

109
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,199
I can. We both want the same thing.

110
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,910
To capture the Director
and take down The Ring.

111
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,538
Are you with me?

112
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:21,416
Can we still be a team?

113
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,587
Yes.

114
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,506
Great.

115
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,383
Everyone's back together again.

116
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:38,225
What is it, boy?
My demo station don't cook by itself.

117
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:39,434
I, uh...

118
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,104
Spit it out, son.

119
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,775
- I don't know.
- Is it your mama?

120
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,780
It's Chuck.

121
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,950
Is he okay? Jeff and Lester,
I could give a damn about them.

122
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,953
Go ahead and fire them. It's okay.

123
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:01,206
Someone else. Who's the issue?

124
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,292
Me. Me, I'm the issue.

125
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,128
This is tough. I'm quitting.

126
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,799
I found a job. A real job.

127
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,261
You can feel proud about it?

128
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,972
You're not selling your body?

129
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,183
You gotta go.

130
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:28,483
- Boy, I can't show emotions like this.
- Mm-hm.

131
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:32,320
Those animals out there, they'll...
They'll get me if I do.

132
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:37,784
I think Morgan is dying.

133
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:44,124
I call dibs on his locker. Its location
is far more prestigious than my own.

134
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:49,004
No, man. Those are tears of joy.
Morgan's leaving.

135
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:51,131
Grimes.

136
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:54,009
- Don't worry, John.
- You will always have us.

137
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:56,803
And now, sans Morgan,
we have room.

138
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,638
- For what?
- For you.

139
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:01,308
In our crew, buddy.

140
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,269
Come on. Hands in.

141
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,027
You can let go of my hand now.

142
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,368
- What is it, Bartowski?
- If I could speak freely?

143
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:21,953
That's not a good idea.

144
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,122
As the titular member
of Team Bartowski...

145
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,167
...I think it's crazy
to put Shaw back in the field so soon.

146
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:31,212
He just found out Sarah killed his wife.
The guy's gotta be emotional right now.

147
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,465
Nobody can control their feelings
that well.

148
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,635
Chuck, what you are seeing in Shaw
is an absolute professional.

149
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:41,056
Something you are not. That's why
I'm moving them out of Burbank.

150
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,684
Moving who out of Burbank?

151
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:47,896
Sarah and Shaw.
I'm proceeding with my original plan.

152
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,523
They'll head up our Ring task force
in Washington.

153
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,235
And what about me?

154
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:58,490
You'll stay in Burbank
until I know what to do with you.

155
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:06,665
Oops.

156
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:16,716
- Where you going, sport? New job?
- It's a secret.

157
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:20,512
You're going to work for Chuck.

158
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,598
I'm not a moron.

159
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:29,354
All right. Isn't it awesome?
Can you believe it? Me, a spy.

160
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:33,358
When General Beckman lets you come
back, me and you will be spies together.

161
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,111
Beckman doesn't forget
a small thing like "treason."

162
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,030
And, uh...

163
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,616
...I'm really learning to enjoy
my new life here.

164
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:45,578
Are you kidding me?
John, your old life was so exciting.

165
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:47,914
The adventures, the missions,
weaponry, women.

166
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,125
- Please stop.
- Right. Got it.

167
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,710
Learn to lock it down.

168
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:57,340
Well, I tell you what.
I'm glad you're okay here, you know?

169
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,844
Won't be the same without you,
but, uh...

170
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,930
Enjoy my old life.

171
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,311
You too.

172
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:15,984
Hey, hey, hey.

173
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:21,072
Got some very exciting news for you.
Hold onto your hat. I did it. I...

174
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,159
What the heck is going on here?

175
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:31,082
Oh. Are you mixing gaming
with whiskey?

176
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,626
She's leaving, man.

177
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,253
Leaving with the other guy.

178
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,006
No, this cannot happen.
This cannot happen.

179
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:43,470
- I thought I stood a chance, you know?
- Yeah, well, you just--

180
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,682
Mm-mm. Uh-uh.

181
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:50,018
- Okay. Okay, buddy. Hand it over.
- Mm-mm. Mm-mm. No.

182
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,479
- Let go.
- No.

183
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:55,940
- You are on a precipice of emotional ruin.
- I'm already over the edge.

184
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,651
You're gonna start quoting
the works of John Hughes.

185
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:02,280
Then things are gonna go really dark,
and I'm not gonna let that happen.

186
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,948
- Hand over the bottle.
- Never! Unh!

187
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:10,205
- Yes, you will.
- Make me.

188
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,667
I hope you're happy.

189
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:18,963
She said she couldn't be with
someone who didn't believe in her.

190
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:22,425
Well, I believed in her.
I just didn't believe in me.

191
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,345
Dude, you are misquoting the line.

192
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:28,056
You are ruining Pretty in Pink for me.
Just stop it.

193
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:31,893
Put the cap back on the bottle,
and let's forget this night ever happened.

194
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:35,855
I'm really good at that, dude.
I've forgotten entire years, man.

195
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,651
- What is happening?
- Hey, Sarah.

196
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,986
Chuck's in a bit of a low spot.

197
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:43,530
Um...

198
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:46,074
Yeah, yeah, I see that.

199
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,076
He found out you're leaving with Shaw.

200
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:51,746
He's also eaten an entire carton
of sugar-free mint ice cream...

201
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:56,543
...which is concerning when you factor
in the large consumption of whiskey.

202
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,921
- Thank you.
- Morgan, can you leave us?

203
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,506
I forgive you.

204
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,008
Great, now I hate this song.

205
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,762
Look, I, uh...

206
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:13,935
I know what I look like. The mint
ice cream sobered me up pretty good.

207
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:17,355
- Chuck, it's okay.
- No, it isn't.

208
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,609
I thought I could save you.

209
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:24,112
I thought Shaw was bad
and I was gonna save you...

210
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,073
...and we were gonna be together,
but that didn't happen.

211
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,284
Shaw's a good spy.

212
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,455
I get it, okay? I think everybody gets
that Shaw is amazing.

213
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:37,458
And you two are gonna run off together
and save the world.

214
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:41,754
And that's great news for the world.

215
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:45,133
But earlier on in my...

216
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,511
...drunken haze...

217
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:52,974
...I realized that
I hadn't asked you a question.

218
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:58,438
A really important question that
I'd like to ask you now, if that's okay.

219
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,649
Just once, for the record.

220
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,322
Sarah, do you love me?

221
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,459
Wow, I'm, uh-- I'm in my underwear.

222
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:23,129
I'm sitting in my underwear
holding a plastic guitar.

223
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:27,175
There's a very good chance I'm making
a complete fool of myself, isn't there?

224
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,136
- Yes.
- I should probably put some pants on.

225
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,013
No, Chuck.

226
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:34,641
Yes.

227
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:38,686
Wha--? Uh, what?

228
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:41,856
Chuck, I fell for you a long,
long time ago.

229
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,942
After you fixed my phone...

230
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:47,695
...and before you started diffusing
bombs with computer viruses. So, yes.

231
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,616
Yes.

232
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:13,888
Wait. Wait.

233
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:19,018
- What about my Red Test?
- Casey told me he killed the mole...

234
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:21,896
...and you couldn't do it,
and it was the best news ever.

235
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:25,692
Because it means that
you haven't changed, you're still Chuck.

236
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,405
You're still my Chuck.

237
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:40,498
I, uh... I will be totally cleaned up
by tomorrow.

238
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,084
You don't have time
because we have a mission.

239
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:47,088
Shaw found the Ring headquarters.
It's a three-man op and you're our third.

240
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:50,383
Mission?

241
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:53,219
- No problem.
- Morgan, what are you doing?

242
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:56,764
Right, where are my manners?
We haven't even met professionally.

243
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:59,684
Morgan Grimes, agent of the CIA...

244
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,729
...and an assistant
to one Charles Irving Bartowski.

245
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,230
Now, let's get to work here.

246
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,232
You heard the lady,
there is a mission...

247
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,443
...and you are needed.

248
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,778
Let's get you some coffee.

249
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:22,457
- You okay, Chuck?
- Huh? Me? Yeah, good. Totally cool.

250
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:26,210
Yeah, ready to go.
Everything is totally normal.

251
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:31,799
All right. The Director
has his own private elevator.

252
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,634
You two are gonna rappel down to it.

253
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:36,721
When the Director leaves, grab him,
I'll pull you back up.

254
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,265
Cool, great.

255
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,145
- Think he knows about us?
- Shh.

256
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,689
I don't wanna upset him over anything.

257
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:48,649
Okay, ready?

258
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:54,113
Don't worry about the warehouse
or Beckman, Chuck.

259
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,825
- I trust you completely.
- Yeah.

260
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,384
Okay, Shaw, we're in.

261
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,262
Hey, hey. Psst. Psst.

262
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,514
Your comm.

263
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:21,849
What's the matter?

264
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,893
I have a concern about Shaw.

265
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,104
While he, yes, is a very great spy...

266
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:28,523
...emotionally,
the guy is Swiss cheese, okay?

267
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,567
Chuck, Shaw is one step closer
to capturing the Director.

268
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:35,029
I'm sure that is all he is thinking about.
So don't even worry.

269
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:39,033
All right, Sarah,
I'm accessing the elevator's controls.

270
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,083
Gentlemen.

271
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,594
- See? See? He knows.
- Shaw, are you okay?

272
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:01,556
He's having a mental break.
We're fish in a barrel.

273
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:17,071
Sorry about that, guys.
A little Ring company.

274
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:20,741
See, I told you
he wasn't trying to kill us.

275
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,994
All right. I'm opening the hatch.

276
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,668
- Don't worry, it's a tranq gun.
- Fine. Just sell that as real.

277
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:34,589
Right, of course. Ruthless spy. You're
gonna take care of most of that, right?

278
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,966
The system is detecting something...

279
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,426
...moving toward the elevator.

280
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,846
- Looks like the Director's coming in early.
- Time to meet our bad guy.

281
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,772
- One word and you're dead.
- Now, this is brazen.

282
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:56,110
- That-- That was four words.
- Kidnapping me in my own lift.

283
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:59,655
Impressive. But there's absolutely
no chance you'll get the cipher.

284
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,659
- Did he just say "cipher"?
- Yeah.

285
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:06,162
- What do you mean?
- Don't play dumb.

286
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,457
We've been building our own Intersect
for a year, you know that.

287
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,001
The cipher is the Intersect's
core processor.

288
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,961
So it's here. Where exactly is it?

289
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:17,632
You won't get 5 feet from this door.
Security will be on you in seconds.

290
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:20,635
That's tough,
because either we get the cipher, or--

291
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:21,969
Pull out your Ring phone.

292
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,722
What Ring phone?

293
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,726
You mean this Ring phone?

294
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,479
Yeah, that Ring phone there.
Call your assistant.

295
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,356
- What?
- You know, your secretary.

296
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:36,400
Whoever you have,
have them bring the cipher to you here.

297
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,904
And put it on speakerphone. You give
her one warning and I'm gonna--

298
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,822
Please. I know the drill.

299
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,159
Denise.

300
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:52,333
You asked for this.
I spoke with Operative 6...

301
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,168
...they'll proceed with the coup.

302
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:57,338
The Spanish ambassador also called
with the ransom offer.

303
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,924
- He wants to close by tomorrow.
- Thank you, Denise.

304
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:03,177
And please text me
when the plane lands in Barcelona.

305
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:11,185
- Barcelona. It's a code.
- "Barcelona" is a code? That's good.

306
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:14,689
- What are we supposed to do with her?
- Personally, I'd shoot her.

307
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:15,856
Decisions, decisions.

308
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:18,025
- What's going on?
- Need a few seconds.

309
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:19,193
We don't have seconds.

310
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:23,698
One of our guys heard something
strange in the elevator shaft.

311
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,577
Welcome to the party.
This is ridiculous.

312
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:29,870
Got it. Here we go.

313
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,083
You know it's over, right?

314
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,377
What?

315
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,379
This was a trap.

316
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:40,089
For you.

317
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,468
Okay, nobody move.
We can all die here today.

318
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,138
You can all die today,
I have dinner reservations.

319
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,223
Look at me.

320
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,810
- Do I look like an amateur?
- No, you don't.

321
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,813
But your partner here
is a very different story.

322
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,815
Not much of a spy, I hear.

323
00:21:58,525 --> 00:21:59,817
I am a spy.

324
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:04,572
Really? With a tranq pistol?
Real gun too dangerous for you?

325
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,245
Put it down.

326
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,583
I'm sorry, Chuck.

327
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:28,679
Daniel, still upset about your wife?

328
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:32,600
You should learn to get over that,
or take it out on Agent Walker.

329
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:33,934
She pulled the trigger.

330
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:38,272
Go. Take the service elevator to the
fifth floor. Then the north stairwell.

331
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,775
I'll get the cipher.
I'll meet you back at Castle.

332
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:44,278
- Shaw, we're not gonna leave you here.
- Sarah, go. Please.

333
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,794
Did he...?

334
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:05,383
I think you're right. I think we should
probably wait to tell him about us.

335
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,315
Good work, Daniel.

336
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:23,692
I think they bought it.

337
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:26,529
Of course they did.

338
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,954
You weren't supposed to eliminate
the Director, Shaw.

339
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,205
This wasn't a Red Op.

340
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,833
I did what I had to,
to get my team out.

341
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,167
Oh! That was a huge kick.

342
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:43,087
Wow. Where did you get this?
Where did we get this footage?

343
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,548
I tapped into
the building's security feed.

344
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:47,758
That's a hell of a roundhouse, buddy.

345
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,969
General, I do think it's worth noting...

346
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:53,055
...that we would all be dead
if it were not for Shaw, so...

347
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,183
Very well.

348
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:58,644
General,
there is also the issue of the cipher.

349
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:01,689
The Director said that
The Ring was making a new Intersect.

350
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:05,067
My team analyzed their cipher
and found problems in the design.

351
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:07,653
The Ring isn't
as far along as they thought.

352
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,489
Looks like the cipher's components
were fabricated in France.

353
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:13,951
That's right. I need you
and Sarah to follow this trail to Paris.

354
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,412
We believe
The Ring's design facility is there.

355
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,165
We can be in the air in 30 minutes.

356
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,251
Excuse me, general.
Uh, what about me?

357
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:24,378
Sorry, Chuck. You're not ready.

358
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,594
We are never gonna get our chance,
are we?

359
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:36,056
Once I get back, it's all gonna happen.
You and me.

360
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:42,480
Don't worry. Just one more mission.

361
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:47,193
Hey, look at you. Nice.
I take it you and Sarah are official.

362
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:49,361
Now, the other guy,
he's out of the way?

363
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:52,239
Well, actually, Sarah and Shaw
are on their way to Paris.

364
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:55,034
Beckman doesn't think I'm ready
to be out in the field.

365
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:59,038
- But other than that, everything's fine.
- How is everything fine?

366
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:02,208
Chuck, I quit my job
so I could join you in the field.

367
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,835
- You did what?
- You said I was a part of your team.

368
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:09,006
That you were gonna speak to Beckman
about me. Did you speak to Beckman?

369
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,675
Of course you didn't.
No, why would you?

370
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,219
I'm not a spy, I'm an idiot.

371
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:16,305
- No, you're not an idiot.
- I gave up a management position...

372
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:19,391
- ...in a down economy.
- I'm sorry. I'm gonna talk to Beckman.

373
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:22,728
Sarah's gonna come back,
and I will prove we are both field ready.

374
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:25,064
Are you kidding?
None of that is gonna happen.

375
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:28,108
Shaw's gonna get Sarah, okay?
You're gonna go willy-nilly...

376
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:31,570
...tie me up again, and drink yourself
into Guitar Hero oblivion.

377
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:34,323
I may have said some unfortunate things
about Shaw.

378
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:37,868
But the fact is, the guy's exactly
what he seems. He's a hero.

379
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,411
That's nice. Good for him.

380
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,789
You know what else he is, dude?
A stud, okay?

381
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,500
And 99 times out of 10,
that guy gets the girl, okay?

382
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,961
- We're done here.
- Buddy-- Morgan. Morgan.

383
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,713
Look, I'm not supposed
to show you this...

384
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:52,091
...but it was so awesome,
I made a copy of it.

385
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:55,719
It will help prove my point.
Here we go.

386
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,179
Okay. This is from the mission.

387
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:58,556
Uh-huh.

388
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,517
That is Shaw
saving our butts right there.

389
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:04,186
Wait for it. Wait for the roundhouse.

390
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,063
Pop. Ah. Ooh.

391
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,107
- God, that's gotta hurt.
- We have a problem.

392
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:10,276
- What?
- Chuck, look at this.

393
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,028
He pulls that punch.

394
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:18,117
And that roundhouse,
it doesn't even land.

395
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,703
But he shot people, Morgan.
Bad people.

396
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,497
Did you see blood, viscera,
brain matter?

397
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,499
Chuck, did you see brain matter?

398
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,377
Okay, listen to me.

399
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:31,630
I have seen every Hong Kong fight film
ever made, all right?

400
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:34,258
I direct your attention
to my Sonny Chiba poster.

401
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,218
I am the man when it comes to this.

402
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,887
I could spot a fake action sequence
from a mile away.

403
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:41,098
And that's what we have here.

404
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,059
But if the fight was staged...

405
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:47,563
...that means that Shaw is working
with The Ring.

406
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,815
And Sarah is with him.

407
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:54,403
I'm uploading the fight footage
to Beckman's home computer now.

408
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,701
Report, Chuck.

409
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:04,455
Uh, general, I'm so sorry about the hour,
but we just figured something out.

410
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,415
Agent Shaw is working with The Ring.

411
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:09,209
Chuck, how many times
do we have to do this?

412
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:11,337
Before, I was right
for the wrong reasons.

413
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:15,341
But this time I'm right
for the right reasons, and I have proof.

414
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,009
Hi, there.

415
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:19,136
What is he doing there?

416
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:22,473
Well, first of all, sir-- Or ma'am.
Is it sir? What am I doing?

417
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:25,184
- Just talk.
- Uh, I thank you for this opportunity.

418
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,895
Stop. What are you doing there?

419
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:30,272
Me? I'm with him.
I'm on Chuck's team.

420
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,901
Oh, no. No, you're not, because Chuck's
not on his own team anymore.

421
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,695
I want both of you
out of Castle in five minutes.

422
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:38,447
Chuck, you are suspended.

423
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,908
No. No. No, general.

424
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:44,370
Come on. She's blocking my call.

425
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:48,832
Well, okay, my time as a spy was
pretty exciting, albeit a bit brief, but--

426
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,542
- You're still a spy.
- Hmm? How's that?

427
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,295
Because I need a team,
and you're all I've got, buddy.

428
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:58,258
CIA or no CIA, we need to save Sarah.
Just the two of us.

429
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:02,012
No. There is another.

430
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,098
So now they're in Paris.
Sarah and Shaw.

431
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:06,975
And Shaw this time,
for real, he is working for The Ring.

432
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:09,395
I know you can't help me anymore,
I know that.

433
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:12,314
But Sarah's gonna die without us.
I can't do this alone.

434
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:15,359
And I can't help you anymore.
I'm not a spy.

435
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:18,529
But you are a spy.
You're the ultimate spy.

436
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:23,450
Was, Chuck. Was.

437
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:26,078
But the man's been Buy More'd.
That's right.

438
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:29,289
You've deluded yourself into thinking
Buy More's your life.

439
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:33,085
Well, wake up, John, okay? Because
we need you to get on this plane.

440
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:35,045
Chuck needs you to get on this plane.

441
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:38,799
And if not, well, that's cool.
Find yourself on Friday night...

442
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,885
...in Jeff and Lester's crew,
hanging out in Woodland Hills.

443
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,263
I know this, because I was that guy.

444
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:49,226
But Chuck and Sarah and you, Casey...

445
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:52,980
...you showed me I could be so much
more, that I'm meant for something.

446
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:55,899
To be a spy.

447
00:28:57,777 --> 00:29:00,988
What about you?
What do you have left in the tank?

448
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:03,323
What do you wanna be
when you grow--?

449
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,870
Morgan, go to my closet
and get me my suit.

450
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:11,832
The black one.

451
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:23,469
- Is this all of it?
- It's everything I could find on Shaw.

452
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:26,680
I can't believe this is happening.
She could be dead, Casey.

453
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,266
Focus on the mission, will you?

454
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:39,526
- What is it? You flashed.
- Mission from 10 years ago.

455
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:40,903
Nothing to do with Sarah.

456
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,906
I could flash on everything here,
we'd still have nothing.

457
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:46,450
I'm stuck in the air
and there's nothing I can do.

458
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:49,828
Focus. Forget about the Intersect.
Forget about being a spy.

459
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:53,248
Before all of that, you were smart.
We're gonna take this intel...

460
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:57,377
...and you're gonna figure out where
Sarah is. It's what you have to do.

461
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:03,759
Where are you, Sarah?

462
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:29,493
Something is off.

463
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,621
What is it?

464
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:46,009
- Why did you bring me here?
- What do you mean?

465
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:52,099
You led me here.

466
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:55,310
Come on, this is where I shot her.
Is this some kind of a trap?

467
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:57,354
Sarah...

468
00:30:58,064 --> 00:30:59,147
...you killed my wife.

469
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,737
Did you really think
that I'd be okay with that?

470
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:06,947
But you said that--

471
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,908
I told you a lot of things
to get you here.

472
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:13,537
Gun's getting heavy, isn't it?

473
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:31,430
You know,
you could hurt someone with this.

474
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:36,435
There's a little café around the corner.
Let's sit down and discuss the details.

475
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:40,814
Just relax. It's all over now.

476
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,118
The drug is a special toxin.

477
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:58,248
It won't kill you,
simply immobilizes your nervous system.

478
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,667
I want you to see
what's gonna happen next.

479
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:03,921
I need you to understand
why I'm doing this.

480
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:08,550
So, Sarah,
I see you've met my newest Ring agent.

481
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,179
Why?

482
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:15,807
I offered Daniel the chance
to not only avenge his wife's death...

483
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:19,937
...but to destroy the very institution
that ordered her murder.

484
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,229
Your CIA.

485
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:34,159
The CIA believed
that Eve had been turned by us.

486
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:37,579
Your boss, Langston Graham,
assigned you to kill her.

487
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:40,040
You did what you were told.

488
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:43,502
I'm going to send a message to the CIA,
they betrayed the wrong man.

489
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,879
Very well put, Daniel.

490
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:51,551
They need to know what they did to me.
They need to feel the pain that I felt.

491
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,721
And that is why I have to kill you.

492
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:01,061
On that note, do you have it with you?

493
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:09,945
The technical data should help your
scientists complete the new Intersect.

494
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:13,407
Thank you, Daniel. We'll be in touch.

495
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,412
- Do you need us to, uh...?
- No.

496
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:24,126
I wanna show her the river,
it's beautiful at night.

497
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:26,294
Good night, then.

498
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:29,131
Goodbye, Sarah.

499
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:37,514
Almost time to go.

500
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:49,192
How'd you find me?

501
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:52,904
I read your file, your wife's.
Every mission you've been on...

502
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:55,949
...every paper you wrote at West Point,
every travel report.

503
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:59,953
You come here once a year
in memory of your wife's death.

504
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:03,665
It made morbid sense
that you'd want Sarah to see it too.

505
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:06,043
Smart. Very smart.

506
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,962
You're under arrest. Now stand up.

507
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,339
Less smart, Chuck.

508
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:15,385
You should pull the trigger, now.
Kill me.

509
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,852
I wouldn't do that.

510
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:30,734
- Bravo Team!
- I see you brought Casey.

511
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,236
Oh, yes, I did.

512
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:36,948
And he's currently taking care
of your new Director.

513
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:39,117
And you've got me?

514
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:41,578
Stand up.

515
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:44,289
I guess the gun was his idea.

516
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:46,041
Good.

517
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:29,501
- Shaw, don't do this.
- You can't flash, can you?

518
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:32,921
Those emotions get you into trouble.

519
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:36,508
Now just stay here.
I don't wanna hurt you.

520
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:38,385
None of this was your fault.

521
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,054
I haven't told them your secret.

522
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:45,350
But if you follow me, I will kill you.

523
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:52,858
Sarah!

524
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:08,999
The drug will dull the pain.

525
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:11,209
You won't feel a thing.

526
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:12,419
Stop!

527
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:17,215
I warned you.

528
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:22,637
Please, it doesn't have to be like this.

529
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:27,976
This isn't you, Shaw.

530
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:29,686
You can't do this.

531
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:35,901
Happy birthday.

532
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:42,365
I love you.

533
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:46,286
No, Chuck. I can. You can't.

534
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,381
Sarah!

535
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:02,719
Hold on, Sarah.

536
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:50,141
We've been over this.
You no longer work for me, John.

537
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:52,560
Unless there's a sale at Buy More...

538
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:55,063
...we have nothing to talk about.

539
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,858
Well, I guess you don't wanna talk
about my little friend here, hmm?

540
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:00,735
The Ring Director.

541
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:05,824
What do you want for him?

542
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:09,744
Well, full reinstatement.
My old rank back...

543
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:11,705
...and a new Crown Victoria.

544
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:17,919
And a request
you're probably not gonna like.

545
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:22,966
It seemed like a good job, but I just...
I couldn't cut it.

546
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:27,887
What I came here to ask of you is:
Can I come back to the store, sir?

547
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,892
Maybe? Just...

548
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:38,857
- I'll see my way out.
- Not yet.

549
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:46,906
I couldn't bear
to put the offer out there.

550
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,868
It's been here waiting for you.

551
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:56,458
Don't worry, son.

552
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,669
- You can always come home.
- Thanks a lot, Big Mike.

553
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:01,296
Dad.

554
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:04,215
- Yeah. Thanks, Big Mike.
- Poppy.

555
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:06,885
Let's go with "Dad." Thanks, Dad.
I like that one.

556
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:14,976
Yo.

557
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:16,603
Morgan Grimes?

558
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:17,812
Yeah, who this?

559
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:21,399
This is General Beckman of the NSA.

560
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:27,280
I'm calling to say that you are officially
a member of Operation Bartowski.

561
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:28,948
You're not kidding me, are you?

562
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:31,868
This isn't some sort of mean prank
or anything, is it?

563
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,412
No, we don't do pranks.

564
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,873
Ahh. You can thank Colonel Casey.

565
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,834
- Okay, I gotta go quit my job. Hold on.
- Don't do that.

566
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:41,920
Your cover is the Buy More.

567
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:45,215
Right. Right. That's perfect.
That's perfect. I'm good at that.

568
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,966
Aye, aye, captain.

569
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:48,176
General.

570
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:50,929
- It's "general.”
- Of course. General. General. Perfect.

571
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:54,557
Thank you. Thank you, sir. Ma'am.
I will not let you down.

572
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:57,602
Are you--? Hello? Hello?

573
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:11,658
Hey.

574
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,374
How you feeling?

575
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,042
Unh. What happened?

576
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,464
Everything's okay now.

577
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,051
What about Shaw?

578
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:34,347
He's dead.

579
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,644
I'm sorry.

580
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:42,021
Oh, my God. We...

581
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:45,942
There was, um...
There was a café, and...

582
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,820
And a bridge.
And he tried to kill me and...

583
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:52,240
Oh, my God, you shot him.

584
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,409
I couldn't let him hurt you, Sarah.

585
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:57,078
Trust me, I did what I had to do.

586
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:02,625
But I'm still the same guy.
I'm still Chuck. I promise.

587
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,461
You saved me.

588
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:30,820
Chuck, Sarah, excellent work.
I've consulted with Colonel Casey...

589
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,614
...and he brought me up to speed.

590
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:35,992
I'll expect a full report
when you get back to Burbank.

591
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,329
Actually, I think we're gonna need
a few more days in Paris.

592
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:42,415
No, I want you back ASAP.
We have a new mission.

593
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:45,877
Last night, a team
of Peruvian assassins broke into the--

594
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:49,339
Agent Bartowski? Agent Walker.

595
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,799
I've lost contact. Get them back.

596
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:55,803
- I don't know--
- Shut up and kiss me.
