1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:05,379
I'm Chuck. Here's a couple of things
you need to know, or maybe you forgot.

2
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:08,966
There's one piece left to be cleaned up:
Perry. Chuck has to kill him.

3
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:11,135
You're giving him his red test tonight?

4
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:14,263
Are you kidding me?
Kill him here? Now? I can't do that.

5
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:15,806
Then you won't become a spy.

6
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:21,020
You passed the test.
To them, you killed Perry.

7
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:24,023
No one can know the truth ever.
Not even Sarah.

8
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,735
You are now officially an agent.
Included is a plane ticket to Washington.

9
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:29,445
You'll leave tonight.

10
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:36,452
First day. Don't be nervous.
Don't be nervous.

11
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:47,588
What floor? Five.

12
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,548
No, not five.

13
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,638
Oh, uh, heh.
I'm so sorry to bother you.

14
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:59,308
You happen to know what floor
General Beckman is on?

15
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:01,643
They told me at the front desk,
and I forgot.

16
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:04,813
You couldn't miss her.
She's little, lots of medals, red hair--

17
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:08,817
Nice, friendly conversation.
That's good. I'm glad we did that. No.

18
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:20,621
Sir.

19
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:25,167
Excuse me, sir, this is a restricted floor.
I need a badge and a signature.

20
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:35,052
Sir, I can't let you examine a body
without an authorized NSA badge.

21
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,972
Would you do me a favor?
Just move one step?

22
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,601
There. Perfect.

23
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,520
What do you think you're doing--?

24
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,384
It's done.

25
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,386
Package is intact.

26
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,888
NSA, General Beckman's office.
Please hold.

27
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:23,142
NSA, General Beckman's office.
Please hold.

28
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:24,476
Thank you for waiting.

29
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,271
Here we are. Thank God.

30
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:31,733
How's it going? Heh.

31
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,239
Super.

32
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,160
Hello. Thank you for waiting.
Yes. I'll put you right through.

33
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:42,619
Excuse me. Hi, my name's--

34
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:45,747
Have a seat, Agent Bartowski.
The general knows you're here.

35
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:52,087
Right. Yeah.
Of course she knows I'm here.

36
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:58,927
Ow. Oh, God. These things are
incredibly uncomfortable.

37
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,013
Is there a place that you like to put this?

38
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,765
Because I'm always having it in the--
Oh, right, yes. Ha, ha.

39
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:08,145
Sorry about that. Finger always on
the slide and, you know, totally empty.

40
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,105
But I hear you. Safety first.

41
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:14,526
- A pleasure as always, general.
- Pleasure's all mine, Diane.

42
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,613
- Mr. Bartowski?
- Yeah. Oh.

43
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,283
For God's sake, put that gun away.
You're a spy now.

44
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,869
Uh, that's actually what I wanted
to talk to you about.

45
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:28,207
Your first assignment just arrived.
The CIA wants you in Rome right away.

46
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,792
- Uh, what? Excuse me? Right away?
- Mm-hm.

47
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,338
You will be posing as an independently
wealthy young expatriate.

48
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,340
That way your jet-setting lifestyle...

49
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:40,010
...and influential associates
won't draw attention.

50
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,637
It's where you'll be staying.

51
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,430
Uh, wow.

52
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,683
Obviously, you will be afforded
all the accoutrements that go with it.

53
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:49,144
Cars, clothes, a yearly stipend.

54
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:53,315
Huh? What? Yearly? Yearly stipend?

55
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:56,151
This is all moving very, very fast.
Don't you think?

56
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,572
The NSA has spent three years
and countless millions of dollars...

57
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,992
...helping you reach your potential.
There's nothing fast about it.

58
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,994
I get that. I do. I do, general.

59
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:09,498
And I certainly don't wanna
come across as being ungrateful...

60
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,417
...for the villa, or the car,
or the stipend, or...

61
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,670
I'm just not sure
that I am really ready...

62
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:18,924
...to pack up and move somewhere
to live this whole new life...

63
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,886
...when I'm just starting to become
comfortable with the life I'm living...

64
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,846
...right now, you know.

65
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:30,852
What exactly did you think we were
training you for, Mr. Bartowski?

66
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,399
I don't really know what to say,
general.

67
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:40,237
- I'm sorry--
- Is not an option.

68
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:48,745
Ahem. I understand
that the handwringing...

69
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:53,125
...and the second-guessing
are all part of your process.

70
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,711
Here's what I'm offering.

71
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:59,381
Take the week off, anywhere you want.
On us.

72
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:02,718
But afterwards,
I expect you back in Washington...

73
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:05,554
...and ready to assemble your team.
Is that understood?

74
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,556
Hang on. Um...

75
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:12,477
Back up a second.
What do you mean by "my team"?

76
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,814
You didn't think we were going
to send you to Rome alone.

77
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:20,736
You'll have your pick of our top agents.
Whoever you want.

78
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:24,573
So where will we be sending you,
Mr. Bartowski? Bali? Bora Bora?

79
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:29,119
Burbank.
Bob Hope Airport, to be exact.

80
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:33,915
I see. And will you be requiring
a companion ticket?

81
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,917
No, thanks.

82
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,046
She's still there.

83
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:25,008
That's, uh--
That's fantastic news. Okay.

84
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,427
Thank you. Ha, ha.

85
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,433
Enough of the suspense, babe.

86
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:36,311
One word, Devon: Africa.

87
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,646
Africa?

88
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,148
That was the hospital.
I mean, I didn't even have to ask.

89
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,859
Out of the blue,
they just offered me a sabbatical.

90
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:45,946
I have a year off.
Do you know what that means?

91
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,240
Africa.

92
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:52,828
We can do Doctors Without Borders,
follow our dreams, whatever you want.

93
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:55,288
- What about Chuck?
- Chuck is moving on.

94
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,457
You know,
I really believe that this time.

95
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,627
You said he was on a business trip
for Buy More, in Washington.

96
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,088
Yeah. He did sound pretty pumped
when I talked to him.

97
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,882
- Who knows where he will end up?
- Who knows? Heh.

98
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,343
Honey,
there's nothing keeping us here. Ha, ha.

99
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,854
Africa. Heh.

100
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,859
I've never had to win a girl back, buddy.
So I stopped by the store on the way.

101
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:27,320
Got Sarah a bunch of stuff.
What do you think? Am I overdoing it?

102
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,239
- You think I'm overdoing it.
- No--

103
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,450
- I'm overdoing it.
- Well...

104
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,660
The chocolates are a nice touch,
I guess...

105
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:36,496
...but I don't think
you'll be able to buy her back.

106
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:39,458
I know, I know, you're right. I just...

107
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,961
It just finally clicked for me.
Sarah is the most important thing.

108
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,213
What's the point of being a spy
without her?

109
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,715
I've got to win her back...

110
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:50,343
...and I've only got a small window
to do it in before I leave for Rome.

111
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:51,928
Hey.

112
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:55,849
- Did you say you're gonna go to Rome?
- My assignment starts there next week.

113
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,018
Then you are still leaving. Thank God.

114
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:02,189
I fed Ellie some story about you working.
She won't go to Africa if you're here.

115
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:03,940
I'm not going without Sarah.

116
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:07,068
Let's get you kids back together.
Shouldn't be too difficult, huh?

117
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,321
You seen the stallion she's dating?

118
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,657
Casey, do you--?
Do you ever knock or use a door?

119
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:17,204
Shaw's not some geek who likes to talk
about his feelings. He's a real spy.

120
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:19,372
Oh. Oh, really? Is that so?

121
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,418
You haven't heard because you no longer
work for the United States government...

122
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,254
...but I'm heading up
my own undercover operation.

123
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,590
- In Rome.
- And I get to choose my own team.

124
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:33,303
Really? Anyone? Including a civilian
with extensive military background?

125
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,847
Take a number, Casey.
Chuck, I speak fluent Italian.

126
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,140
Menu items, mostly.

127
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,808
- Mm-hm.
- I'd be an invaluable asset.

128
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:42,062
I gotta get Sarah back first.
Then we can start talking about a team.

129
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,523
What are we waiting for?
Let's help the guy.

130
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,776
- Yeah. So Ellie and I can go to Africa.
- And I can get out of Burbank.

131
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:51,780
And I can finally go see Rome.
Meet a nice Italian girl. See the Vatican.

132
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,990
Pay my respects to the Pope.

133
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:56,451
What are you waiting for, lover boy?

134
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:04,084
- Hey, um...
- You're back.

135
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,336
I've been calling you
for a couple days now.

136
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:09,005
You know,
there's a lot we need to talk about.

137
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:12,801
- I know. I'm sorry, I've been a little--
- Crazy. Yeah, I know.

138
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,303
Beckman flew me to DC.

139
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,556
I got my badge. It's official now.
I'm an agent.

140
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,891
Congratulations. You earned it.

141
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,310
You know, the CIA,
they're sending me to Italy.

142
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:25,146
You wouldn't believe the villa
they're putting me up in.

143
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:27,774
I'm supposed to be
some rich, young playboy.

144
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:31,611
But who cares about that?
The point is, Sarah...

145
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:35,323
- ...I want you to go with me.
- Chuck. I can't.

146
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:38,118
I get to choose my team.
Cream of the crop. That's you.

147
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:41,955
I'm going to Washington, okay?
And I'm going with Shaw.

148
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,332
Wait. Wait a minute.

149
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,044
Wasn't this the plan? There's nothing
stopping us from being together now.

150
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:50,839
- I passed my spy test.
- That's why I can't be with you.

151
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,633
You're not...
You're not the same guy that I fell for.

152
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:57,053
How? Why? Because I'm an agent now?
How am I not the same guy?

153
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,514
You killed somebody, Chuck.
I saw you kill the mole.

154
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:11,192
Sarah, I know what you think you saw
on the train tracks...

155
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,904
...but it's not that simple.
It's more complicated than that.

156
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:18,992
It's not what you think,
and I need you to believe me.

157
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,494
I don't.

158
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,914
Hope I'm not interrupting.

159
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:33,131
Congratulations on your promotion,
Special Agent Bartowski.

160
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:37,177
Thank you, sir. Thank you.
Yeah, it's, uh, very exciting.

161
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,429
So, what brings you back to Burbank?

162
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,306
Um...

163
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,767
I, uh...

164
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:47,145
You know, just, uh--
Just tying up a few loose ends.

165
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:50,148
Chuck was just wondering
if I had any last-minute advice...

166
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,859
...on his new assignment in Rome.

167
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:56,571
Well, you shouldn't have come to her.

168
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,742
You should've come to me.
I was stationed there for two years.

169
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,411
Come on, I can tell you
everything you need to know.

170
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,372
Oh, great.

171
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:21,054
- Hey. How'd it go with Walker?
- Because she thinks I killed the mole...

172
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:24,099
...she believes I'm no longer the guy
she fell in love with.

173
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:27,644
- I have to tell her the truth.
- That I killed him? Not gonna happen.

174
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:30,438
- The guy was a traitor.
- According to Beckman, so am I.

175
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,774
I'm lucky she didn't put a bullet
in my head.

176
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:36,027
- Get her back some other way.
- What am I supposed to tell Sarah?

177
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:39,698
Whatever you want, just not the truth.
You like being a full-fledged spy?

178
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,909
You like that nice villa
the CIA picked out for you in Rome, hmm?

179
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,704
Then you killed the mole.
That's how it's gotta be.

180
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:49,708
- Okay, how did it go? How did it go?
- Crashed and burned.

181
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,711
- Chuck, did you tell her how you feel?
- Forget it.

182
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,964
She's leaving with Shaw in the morning.
I'm sorry, it's over.

183
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,632
I'm gonna go get some air...

184
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,593
...and figure out how I'm gonna
tell Beckman I'm quitting.

185
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,974
There goes our chance
to ever get out of the Buy More.

186
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,351
Really? Is that what they teach you
in the Marine Corps?

187
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,437
- Hmm?
- Roll over and die?

188
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:11,980
This isn't exactly combat, Morgan.

189
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:17,277
That's where you're wrong, Casey.
Because love... Love is a battlefield.

190
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:21,948
Ah.

191
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,200
Hey, fellas. Need your help.

192
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:27,746
- Actually, Chuck needs your help.
- Went and lost his old lady again, huh?

193
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,789
- How'd you know?
- We know everything.

194
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:32,584
We're the eyes and the ears
of the strip mall, my friend.

195
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,545
Chuck better move quick
if he wants his fro-yo ho back.

196
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:39,883
Another fella sniffing around
the Orange Orange.

197
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:43,636
Guy knows how to fill out a pair
of slacks, if you know what I'm saying.

198
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:46,639
- No, I don't know what that--
- Shh.

199
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,975
You want us to put a tail
on blondie's new piece?

200
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:52,020
Find out his weakness?
See what skeletons are in his closet?

201
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,272
Blood sample? Urine? Stool?

202
00:12:55,274 --> 00:13:00,028
No. No, not-- I just...
I just need to borrow something.

203
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,331
Whoa! Whoa!

204
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:15,043
What the crap is going on?
You guys scared the bejesus out of me.

205
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,212
We're here to help you
reacquire Agent Walker.

206
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:20,840
- Guys, listen, you don't understand.
- No, Chuck, you don't understand.

207
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:23,301
You're not the only one
with something at stake.

208
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,304
Yeah. We help you get the girl,
you help us get out of Burbank.

209
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,973
Think of it as a test run for Rome.
Ha, ha. What do you think?

210
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,976
Hey, get dressed.
Reservation's in 10 minutes.

211
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,978
- Reservation for what?
- Get him in.

212
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,731
- What are you doing with Jeff's van?
- Go, go, go.

213
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,238
Target's on the move.

214
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:47,450
Guys, what are we doing here?
It's Shaw's date.

215
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:52,831
Wow. Now that guy can fill out
a pair of slacks. He's a real stallion. Huh.

216
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:56,334
Don't listen to him. We have a plan.
You got nothing to worry about, man.

217
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:59,212
Target is in position, sir.

218
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:06,928
Looks like a romantic dinner.
Sorry, Shaw.

219
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:13,059
1990 Château Latour.
Excellent choice.

220
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:16,646
Knowledge of fine wine, very classy.

221
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:20,400
He just ordered for both of them.
That's a power move, bro.

222
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,235
Yeah, well, the guy's a closer.

223
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:26,614
Guys, a little sensitivity
would really go a long way.

224
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,242
Just a smidgin. A scoatch. A dab.

225
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,995
We are, after all,
talking about the girl I love here.

226
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,041
I'm sorry.

227
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,586
What could you be sorry for?
This is amazing.

228
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:43,131
It's just, I'm sorry that
we haven't done this sooner.

229
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,843
- This is nice.
- No, it's perfect.

230
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,345
Being here with you.

231
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:55,101
To a new life and
a fresh start. No Burbank, no baggage.

232
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:58,688
This isn't good. Why doesn't
John here just drag him out of there?

233
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:02,275
Yeah, I'm afraid my days of legalized
body snatching are over, guys.

234
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:05,486
I'm a civilian now.
This one's on you, Bartowski.

235
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:08,364
Do not go in there too hot.
You will scare her away.

236
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:11,492
No, negative, okay?
Chuck has to lay it all on the line.

237
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,746
Shaw may be handsome, worldly,
and know his way around a menu...

238
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,832
...but he's stiff as a board.
Where's that, uh, Bartowski charm?

239
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,418
- You flash a smile, you go in there--
- Morgan.

240
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:24,088
Why don't you let me handle it, okay?
I've had my fair share of ladies.

241
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:27,592
Because you live in a bubble, okay?
Take a look at yourself. Go ahead.

242
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,053
It's a freakish bubble
of handsomeness.

243
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,973
Now look at me. No bubble.
I gotta be completely verbal.

244
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:37,018
Chuck, you just go in and you be fun
and you be witty...

245
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,395
...and you be the charming guy
she fell for. Yeah?

246
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:42,231
Okay. Okay, fine.
But what about Shaw?

247
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:47,070
Hey, just worry about the girl.
I'll take care of the stallion.

248
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,873
Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Shaw,
you have a phone call.

249
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:06,714
All right, target's on the move.

250
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,845
Agent Shaw,
I am an operative of the Ring.

251
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:15,556
If you want to save everyone
in this restaurant...

252
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:18,351
...you will listen to my instructions
very carefully...

253
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:21,396
...and you will do everything
that I say.

254
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,606
Ha, ha. Shh.

255
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,651
Where the hell you think you're going?

256
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,362
Exit the restaurant
through the side door...

257
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,114
...and head to the back alley.

258
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:38,538
All right, we've lost visual on the target.
Bring up the phone tap.

259
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:42,000
Stay cool and nobody will get hurt.

260
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,459
Who the hell is that?

261
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:55,430
- Is this seat taken?
- Chuck, what are you doing here?

262
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:03,479
- I'm here for you.
- What do you want me to say?

263
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,149
That you'll come with me to Rome.

264
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:08,651
Well, you know that I can't
and you know why.

265
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:12,113
I don't wanna have to make a scene
in front of all these people...

266
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,449
...but I will literally do anything
to change your mind.

267
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:16,284
Then tell me what really happened.

268
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,703
If you didn't kill the mole,
then who did?

269
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:23,624
I don't want there to be any secrets
or lies between us ever again.

270
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:26,335
So please, just let me have this one.

271
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:30,173
And I promise I will never lie to you.

272
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:36,596
There you will head to a pay phone.
Southwest corner. Do it.

273
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,265
But do it slowly.

274
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:42,894
- Slowly.
- Not one of ours.

275
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,980
Take him down.

276
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,734
We know
exactly what you look like, Shaw.

277
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:54,822
Six-foot-two, 220, raven-black hair.
Very attractive.

278
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,456
Your next move
will be to wait for a phone call.

279
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:07,710
Might not happen right away,
so be patient. And then when you--

280
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:11,005
Do you have any idea
who these people are?

281
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,799
- What they're capable of?
- Mm-mm. Nope.

282
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,842
Listen...

283
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:20,264
...you think I'm not that same guy
you met the first day at the Buy More.

284
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:24,602
You're right. Okay? You're right.
The guy that I was then hated himself...

285
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,438
...for not knowing
what he wanted to do with his life...

286
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:33,653
...or who he wanted to spend it with,
but now, finally now, I know.

287
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,531
I wanna be a spy.

288
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,574
And I wanna be with you.

289
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:44,205
It's just a harmless prank,
listen, you have to understand--

290
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,749
Who the heck are they?
Is that a Taser?

291
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,251
Sorry about this.

292
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,514
Sarah.

293
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,891
Man down. I've been tased.

294
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:07,019
I can't feel my legs. Bring a stretcher.
A wheelbarrow.

295
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:09,689
Possible change of pants.

296
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,693
Casey, you gotta do something.
He's gunning for Chuck.

297
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:17,864
Mm-mm. I'm a civilian now. I can't.
- Well, I can.

298
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,993
Daniel.

299
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:25,621
If you're gonna shoot me, just do it.
Put a bullet in my head.

300
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:27,415
Whoa.

301
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,834
The director wants to meet you
face to face.

302
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,669
What are you saying?

303
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,797
Sarah, I'm saying that I--

304
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:44,265
- Did you see what happened?
- Oh, my God.

305
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,516
No, I'm okay.

306
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:50,021
Next time,
tackle the guy with the gun.

307
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,480
Huh?

308
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,610
Jail? Seriously? You guys, jail?

309
00:19:55,777 --> 00:20:00,281
I mean, Morgan, I would've
expected this from you, or even Casey--

310
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,451
Now that we've all been privy
to your public-indecency problem.

311
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,912
--But Devon,
I never expected this from you.

312
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,080
- No, babe. I'm so sorry, I just--
- You know what?

313
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:11,417
Just save the apology, okay?
I want answers.

314
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:14,587
I want the truth.
I want you guys to tell me everything.

315
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,297
- The truth.
- Yes.

316
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:21,302
- The truth is--
- We were, uh, helping Chuck.

317
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,720
Chuck is in D.C., Casey.

318
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:26,474
Oh, he was. He's back to win back Sarah.

319
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,267
Hold on for a minute.

320
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,978
You guys expect me to believe
that the three of you...

321
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:35,233
...got my husband beat up and tossed
in jail to save my brother's love life?

322
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,443
- Yes, we did.
- We're as shocked as you are.

323
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:42,615
And what's more,
Chuck came to you three for advice...

324
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,325
- ...before me?
- Yup.

325
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,661
Why am I not surprised
this ended in jail?

326
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:52,083
We have just received intel that the Ring
agent who tried to capture you...

327
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,670
...is the same man who removed
a data drive from inside the mole's body.

328
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,004
The data was inside him?

329
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,924
He was in the process of digesting it
when he was killed.

330
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,927
- I'll spare you the gory details.
- Lucky he was dead first.

331
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:06,639
We believe the stolen data drive
contains highly-sensitive case files.

332
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,975
Your new mission
is to bring back those files.

333
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:11,978
General, if I may,
it's not good enough.

334
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:14,480
Excuse me, Agent Shaw,
you have a better idea?

335
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:17,108
The Ring agent we encountered
didn't wanna kill me.

336
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:21,195
He wanted to take me to the director.
If the Ring wants to take me, let them.

337
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,364
You're volunteering
to be a double agent?

338
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:27,326
I'm volunteering to be a bull's-eye.
Paint a target on the Ring from within.

339
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,787
I get close to the director,
and track his location.

340
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,539
- And then what?
- Your call, general.

341
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:34,208
But I'd suggest
you launch an air strike.

342
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,546
Shouldn't we stop and ask what the
Ring wants with you in the first place?

343
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:42,049
- And why they want you alive?
- It doesn't matter.

344
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:45,636
We can decimate the Ring's command
structure with a single mission.

345
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:49,181
I see the merits,
but you do recognize the danger?

346
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:52,268
General, this is the moment
I've been waiting for.

347
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,312
We've been waiting for.

348
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,314
A singular opportunity.

349
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,899
Whatever the risk may be,
I say it's worth it.

350
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:01,986
Very good. Make it work.

351
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,238
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

352
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:08,784
You're asking if I'd trade my life
for the man who killed my wife?

353
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,204
I would.

354
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:17,501
- Well, what if I don't let you?
- It's not your choice.

355
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:25,259
Hello?

356
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:29,096
This is Daniel Shaw.
I believe you've been looking for me.

357
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:30,431
I'm ready to come in.

358
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:34,685
It's done.

359
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:42,610
- Ellie. Hey. Um, look, I can explain.
- Listen--

360
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:44,862
I know what you're gonna say.
You're right.

361
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,073
It was immature
to get everyone involved.

362
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,700
- You're not listening.
- Maybe "stupid" is the word?

363
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:52,578
- I get it, I went too far.
- You didn't go far enough, Chuck.

364
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:55,581
Sarah is special.
I know it. You know it.

365
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:58,459
If you love her, if she's the one,
then you don't stop...

366
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,462
...you don't quit, you never go too far.

367
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:07,051
You are a Bartowski, Chuck,
start acting like one.

368
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:19,313
Shaw, please. You're moving too fast.
You're not thinking this through.

369
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:22,400
Hey, we're spies, Walker,
let's start acting like it.

370
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:26,445
You don't have to do this.
There's gotta be another way.

371
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,364
It's the only way to be sure.

372
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:31,367
I have to do this. I'm sorry.

373
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:43,879
Hey--

374
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,806
- What's that?
- It's how you'll find me.

375
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:57,476
This will give Beckman
the coordinates for the air strike.

376
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,066
Ahem. Wow.

377
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:09,447
You just swallowed that thing whole, huh?
No water to wash it down.

378
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,452
Take care of her, Chuck.

379
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,879
Uh, where's he going?

380
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:26,964
Shaw's turning himself in to the Ring.

381
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,717
He's leading us to them.

382
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,053
He's sacrificing himself, Chuck.

383
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,765
Oh.

384
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:43,147
Never should've let Morgan
lay his dirty little hands on Loretta.

385
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:46,400
- She's a sweet van, my friend.
- That's van's my retirement, dude.

386
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:50,863
And they took the van and they left us.
That is a slap in the face.

387
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:55,743
It's insulting. Do they have any idea
how much stalking experience I have?

388
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:58,329
If only they did, Jeffrey.
You're very prolific.

389
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:01,499
You're the Picasso of creepiness.

390
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,835
It's true, and this is my Blue Period.

391
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,509
There's the guy.

392
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:17,556
Blondie's new boyfriend. We need
to demonstrate our worth, Jeffrey.

393
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:20,267
Show them that we can stalk
with the best of them.

394
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:24,730
- What do you say, my friend?
- Let's do the dizzle.

395
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,943
Shaw's going on a suicide mission?

396
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:32,279
I don't care what he says,
I am not letting him go in alone.

397
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:43,791
He's not going in alone.

398
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,548
Chuck, what are you doing?
Shaw needs help.

399
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:53,259
I know he does. That's why I'm going in
to bring him back.

400
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:57,137
But the air strike is on its way.
You're both gonna get killed.

401
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,014
Why are you helping him?

402
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:03,978
Because I know
how much you care about him.

403
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,457
Glad you could make it.

404
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,002
The director's expecting you.

405
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:35,676
- You think he saw us?
- Never.

406
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,722
Frisk him.

407
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:44,018
Stalker's log: Stalkee is behind
a gray van with another male.

408
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:46,312
Possibly for a sexual encounter.

409
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:49,898
Both men are physically fit.
Should be lively.

410
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:52,443
Jeffrey, don't make me afraid
to be alone with you.

411
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:57,406
In case you swallowed a tracker.
Rather err on the side of caution.

412
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:03,704
They're much quieter
when they're dead.

413
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,297
What do we have here?

414
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:17,760
Now we can go see the director.

415
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,995
This is the exact model
our federal government uses...

416
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,373
...when cleaning up hot zones.

417
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:49,750
Murder investigations.

418
00:27:57,801 --> 00:28:00,302
So does this model
come with any rebates?

419
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:05,933
Huh?

420
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:10,813
Morse code. Gotta run.

421
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,481
It's on the house.

422
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:34,545
- Lester, I'm in the middle of something.
- Oh, yeah, no worries, buddy.

423
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:38,549
I too am a bit busy "stalking Sarah's
new stallion," as Jeffrey would say.

424
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:42,094
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Hang up, I've been insulted enough.

425
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:45,639
Wait, wait. No, no, no. You guys
are stalking Sarah's new stallion?

426
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:49,268
Yes, on our off time, to show you
what amateurs you're working with.

427
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:52,312
- Can you see him right now?
- No, we're behind a dumpster.

428
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,191
But Mr. Fancypants and some frat guys
were heading into a dingy warehouse.

429
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:58,318
Dude is into some kinky stuff.

430
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:02,781
Okay, listen, Lester, I need you
to tell me where you are right now.

431
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:06,660
Ah, it looks like we're at the corner
of 2nd and Alvarado.

432
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,969
- Hey.
- Oh, thank you, Casey.

433
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:27,139
I haven't used Morse code
since basic training.

434
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:29,641
I use it to talk to my Marine buddies.
What's up?

435
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,935
Shaw gave himself up
to meet the director...

436
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:35,272
...Chuck locked me in here,
and Beckman's gonna bomb the location.

437
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,192
- Shaw dies an American hero.
- Not if I can help it.

438
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:40,861
Okay, good. He's still on the move.
Thank you, Casey.

439
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:44,239
I'm sorry, I can't let you stay in here.

440
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:49,495
- Now, Casey.
- Grr!

441
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,711
Hey, where is he?

442
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:01,173
Nice to see you too.
Suspects have entered the building.

443
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:04,176
You guys are the most amazing stalkers
I've ever seen.

444
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:07,179
- I will tell my grandchildren about you.
- Wait.

445
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:10,057
Wanna borrow some brass knuckles?
Nunchucks?

446
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:11,892
Uh...

447
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,560
Why would you even have--? No.

448
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:17,523
While I appreciate that, Jeff, very much,
I don't believe in violence.

449
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:20,359
So you expect us to have your back?

450
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:22,736
- No, thanks.
- Okay, see you later.

451
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,011
Wow.

452
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:39,187
Tracker's gone subterranean.
Location has stabilized and remains fixed.

453
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:40,814
Agent Shaw has arrived.

454
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:43,942
And the B-2 has been deployed
with bunker busters.

455
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,528
- What do you wanna do?
- Drop the bombs.

456
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:48,655
And Agent Shaw?

457
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:51,533
He's a true American hero.

458
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:01,793
Welcome, Daniel.

459
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:05,088
I've been waiting to meet you
for a long time.

460
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:08,550
If you're gonna kill me,
get it over with.

461
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:12,638
I don't want to kill you, Daniel.
I want to educate you.

462
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,436
- What is this?
- A gift.

463
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:23,190
It's the answer you have been
seeking for all these years.

464
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:32,741
The camera loves you.
The camera loves you.

465
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:35,661
Happy birthday. Happy birthday.

466
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:37,704
Okay, my turn, give me the camera.

467
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:41,208
Maybe it was a bad idea to give you
a video camera for your birthday.

468
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:43,251
Your wife was quite beautiful.

469
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:47,005
Now you're just wasting tape.
This is ridiculous.

470
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,590
How did you get this?

471
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:51,051
We have lots of information on Eve.

472
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:56,056
Just watch, Daniel. It's time you learnt
the truth about your wife's murder.

473
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:01,687
I thought you might like to see some
surveillance footage from that night.

474
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:18,328
- No!
- This must be so difficult for you.

475
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:25,377
You didn't think
I'd come here in person.

476
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,088
I'll be in touch.

477
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:34,428
Three minutes to target.

478
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,185
Heh.

479
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:43,854
No flash necessary.

480
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,194
- Wow, good tranqs.
- Freeze.

481
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:56,116
Drop it.

482
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,928
We've got a lock on the tracker.

483
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:53,316
Congratulations, Agent Walker.
We destroyed a Ring compound...

484
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,986
...hopefully eliminating
some of their higher ups...

485
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,155
...and you managed to rescue
Agent Shaw.

486
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,407
Once again, you and your team prevail.

487
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:03,410
I can't take any of the credit, general.
It was all Chuck.

488
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:06,329
- He saved Shaw by himself.
- Duly noted.

489
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:10,834
Well, Agent Walker, it's been a highly
memorable three years in Burbank.

490
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:14,254
I look forward to working
face to face with you in Washington.

491
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,089
Have a safe flight.

492
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:19,885
How's Shaw doing?

493
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:24,097
He's still unconscious but the doctors
say he'll make a full recovery.

494
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:25,599
Thanks to you.

495
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:28,059
Well, he would have done
the same for me.

496
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:32,564
Look,
I don't wanna pester you, Sarah...

497
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:36,610
...uh, or become some nuisance
that you can't avoid--

498
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:40,280
I've seen Morgan go down that road
far too many times to count.

499
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:44,743
--And since I've already given the fancy,
eloquent version of this speech before...

500
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:47,787
...right now I'm just gonna be blunt
and honest.

501
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:52,209
I love you.

502
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:56,546
One more time because
it feels really nice to say, I love you.

503
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:59,758
I feel like I've been bottling this up
forever. I love you.

504
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:02,219
- Chuck, you don't have--
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

505
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:05,138
I'm getting out of hand, but...

506
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:10,310
Look, you were right in Prague.
You and I, we're perfect for each other.

507
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,646
I wanna spend the rest of my life
with you...

508
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:15,815
...away from everyone else,
and away from the spy life.

509
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:19,611
Chuck, I've made a commitment,
and not just to Shaw.

510
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,321
Don't go.

511
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:25,325
Don't do it. Leave with me instead.
Tonight at 7:00. Union Station.

512
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:28,078
We go to Mexico, and after that,
anywhere that you want.

513
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:31,623
I would like to go and see
the Eiffel Tower at some point...

514
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:35,794
...if that's at all possible.
Don't answer now. Don't say a word.

515
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,296
I don't wanna have to convince you.

516
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:41,466
I just want you to show up.

517
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:47,097
I'm gonna kiss you now,
if that's okay.

518
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:14,040
I'm gonna go home to pack.
Both summer and winter wear.

519
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,877
I love you, Sarah Walker.

520
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:19,879
Always have.

521
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:01,254
This is Shaw.

522
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:17,937
- You got a sec?
- Uh, yeah, sure. Come on in.

523
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:26,446
- Uh, can I get you a drink or anything?
- No, no. I can't stay.

524
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:30,033
I just wanted to come by and tell you
something about Bartowski.

525
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:33,787
Well, if you came to plead his case,
then that's really not necessary.

526
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:36,915
No, he didn't send me.
He doesn't know I'm here.

527
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:41,336
I just wanted to tell you something
in case it changed anything.

528
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:46,466
- He didn't kill the mole.
- What?

529
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:48,968
I did.

530
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:53,973
He didn't have the stones
to pull the trigger. Kid's not a killer.

531
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:56,434
Just not wired that way.

532
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:58,561
Unlike us.

533
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,481
Just thought you should know.

534
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:04,067
See you around.

535
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:08,154
- Casey?
- Yeah?

536
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:10,949
Thank you.

537
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:16,704
You have a nice life, Walker.

538
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:51,948
Hey. Washington will have to wait.
We have a trace on the director.

539
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,868
- I have the details in the car. Come on.
- I need to call Chuck.

540
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:57,454
There's no time.
You can do it from the car.

541
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,300
Chuck, we have an urgent situation.

542
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,886
Our forensic team was able
to recover this video...

543
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:15,054
...from the wreckage
of the Ring's bunker.

544
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:18,224
The woman is Agent Eve Shaw.
Daniel Shaw's deceased wife.

545
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:21,561
This is all very touching, general,
but what does it have to do with Sarah?

546
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:25,356
Keep watching. The data drive the Ring
recovered from the mole's body...

547
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:28,151
...we now believe it contained footage
of a red test...

548
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,904
...conducted on the night
of Agent Shaw's death.

549
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,827
That's Sarah.

550
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:41,498
- Sarah killed his wife? Did you know?
- I assure you...

551
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:45,376
...I had no knowledge that Agent Walker
was responsible for Eve Shaw's death.

552
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:51,007
If Shaw has seen this...
If the Ring played him this video...

553
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:54,093
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, general,
where is Sarah now?

554
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:56,387
We believe she's with Agent Shaw.

555
00:41:56,555 --> 00:42:00,725
Do you have any idea where
Agent Shaw might have taken her?

556
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:07,899
I still don't have a signal.
Daniel, where are you taking us?

557
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,111
To settle an old score.
