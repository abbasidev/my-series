1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:04,420
I'm Chuck.
Here are a few things you need to know.

2
00:00:04,587 --> 00:00:07,256
There is an undercover DEA agent
in the courtyard.

3
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:10,300
- I knew it was you. Your cover?
- Carina.

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,053
- That's beautiful.
- My mom's charm bracelet.

5
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:15,806
We could run together.
We have to go. This is it.

6
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,600
- Are you coming?
- I can't. They wanted me to be a spy.

7
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:22,104
Really important people told me
they thought I could change the world.

8
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:25,733
I acted impulsively,
and it won't happen again.

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,903
You're a spy now, Chuck. You have
to keep your feelings to yourself.

10
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:09,443
Yeah, can I call you back? I'm just
in the middle of something for work.

11
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,153
Yeah, me too.

12
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:14,865
I love you too, Smooshy.

13
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:30,005
All right!

14
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,509
I feel the same
And I wanna meet her

15
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:36,178
God, it feels like I haven't been off duty
in years.

16
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:39,515
- How long you in town for anyway?
- I plan on getting out quick.

17
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:42,351
Los Angeles has the cultural panache
of a Porta-Potty.

18
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:43,727
I've missed you.

19
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:49,149
So why are you still here?

20
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:52,444
How long can you have to protect
some doofus at a stereo store?

21
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,238
I don't really wanna talk about work.

22
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:56,573
Ah. So you're sleeping with him.

23
00:01:56,741 --> 00:02:00,828
We have a very professional
relationship.

24
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:02,871
Without being disrespectful

25
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,206
Oh.

26
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:08,252
- What?
- Nothing.

27
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,878
You're just really into him.

28
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:13,507
- Can we please not talk about Chuck?
- Oh, my God, Walker.

29
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:16,510
- What?
- You broke the cardinal rule of spying...

30
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,345
...didn't you?

31
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:25,227
You're breaking the rule
of getting dumped.

32
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:29,189
- Talk about something other than Sarah.
- Yeah, we could. Except you're moping.

33
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:30,941
I am not moping.

34
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,735
- What are we doing here?
- Could you pause the game?

35
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:37,239
I know you're upset about Sarah,
but there's no pause button on life.

36
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,908
What I'm trying to say,
we are two sexy bachelors...

37
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:43,453
...with the world at our fingertips.
Our lives are incredible.

38
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,917
Yeah, incredibly average to subpar.

39
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:53,172
Look, all I'm saying is there's gotta be
2 million ladies in the City of Angels.

40
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:56,216
They can't all say no to us.

41
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,805
Blew out of the crib

42
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,265
Looking cool in the blazer

43
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,058
Had the shoes with the blazer

44
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:07,311
Don't get rich, Chuck. Ha-ha.

45
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,232
Here we go. Thirsty, ladies?

46
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,152
Cosmo, piña colada, Mai Tai,
rum and Coke, gin and tonic?

47
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,321
Well-hydrated already. Well-hydrated.

48
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:19,573
Buddy,
I don't know if I'm ready for this.

49
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,450
No one's asking you to fall in love.

50
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:24,620
We're here to have you forget
about Sarah for a little while.

51
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,622
Oh, my God. It's Sarah.

52
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:29,499
What? What?
What do you mean Sarah? My Sarah?

53
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:33,295
Technically, she's single
if you think about-- Yes, your Sarah.

54
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:37,799
And she's with Carina.

55
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,596
Think she'd remember me?
We did go on that date.

56
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,681
- Tall women have short memories.
- Okay.

57
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,100
I'm gonna go and do a little spy work,
buddy.

58
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,978
- Yeah, yeah.
- So you go and get some drinks.

59
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:53,941
And I'll kind of suss out the situation
with Carina.

60
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:58,153
Hey. Hi. Hi, Carina. Long time.

61
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:01,490
- Wow, what a nice surprise.
- And, Sarah, good to see you tonight.

62
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:02,658
- Sorry.
- Chuck.

63
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:05,327
What are you doing here?
Are you spying on me?

64
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:08,789
No, I'm just out for an innocent evening
with an old friend.

65
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,999
Yeah, what do you want?

66
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:14,670
Yeah, we're just out here
soaking in the sights and sounds...

67
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,713
...of whatever the evening may bring.

68
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:18,173
- Great. Good.
- Great.

69
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:21,510
- Hey. Hey, babe.
- Hey, baby.

70
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,724
I'm so glad you're both here.

71
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:30,185
I can tell you our great news
at the same time.

72
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:33,814
- This is my fiancé, Karl.
- Wow.

73
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,399
Sarah Walker, my best friend.

74
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:37,359
- And Chuck, her boyfriend.
- Chuck.

75
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:43,490
- Right. Chuck the boyfriend, that's me.
- Great to meet you guys.

76
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:44,992
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

77
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,577
That's crazy.
It's so nice to finally put a face...

78
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,747
...to all the amazing stories
that we've heard for so long.

79
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:53,709
Yeah. Or short, depending
on the length of your courtship.

80
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:57,337
It's really great to meet you. You're
exactly how Carina described you.

81
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:58,672
To the T.

82
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,758
Thank you.
Love really has made me a better man.

83
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,218
What about you, Chuck?

84
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:08,181
What about me? Oh, love, yeah.
Love is a powerful tonic, is it not?

85
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:11,727
- I love you, Smooshy.
- I love you, Smoosh.

86
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:16,064
I'm really sorry to cut this short, guys.
I've booked a romantic dinner for two.

87
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,733
Go do it, yeah.

88
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,736
- I'll meet you at the valet?
- Okay. I'll miss you, Smoosh.

89
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:22,904
Miss you more, Smooshy.

90
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,200
- Okay, guys, good seeing you.
- Nice to meet you.

91
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,119
Yeah, for sure.

92
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,248
Congratulations.
You guys seem really in love.

93
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:44,259
Oh! I hate to tell you,
Karl's not who you think he is.

94
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,595
- He's a bad man. He's a--
- An arms dealer?

95
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:49,264
Yeah, my mark.

96
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,266
What, you think I'm an idiot?

97
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,603
It's the cardinal rule:
spies don't fall in love.

98
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,440
Welcome to your new mission.

99
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:49,991
Oh, look who's back.

100
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:53,995
- Only thing that changes are the clothes.
- Everything's about to change, people.

101
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,998
Bet you're wondering
why I'm wearing my Sunday finery.

102
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:01,128
Because I am here to do my finest
every day.

103
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:03,588
Question is, are you?

104
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:09,678
Oh, that's not a rhetorical question.
Yes. The answer is yes.

105
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,598
- Ham.
- With Emmett gone...

106
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:17,352
...Buy More has given me
a second chance to manage here.

107
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,855
I do not take that responsibility lightly.

108
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:22,107
I've learned much
from my business class...

109
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,317
...at El Segundo School of Finance.

110
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,403
I intend to apply that knowledge here.

111
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:30,991
Do you know that the Japanese
have no word for no?

112
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:35,120
Seven hundred thirty ways to say yes,
but no word for no.

113
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,205
When we are selling...

114
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:40,917
...we no longer understand
the meaning of the word no.

115
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:46,882
No, Morgan. I do not have any more intel
on the guy Carina left the club with.

116
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:49,050
Okay, but I still got a shot here, right?

117
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:52,179
I mean,
she can't have real feelings for this guy.

118
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,055
That's a safe assumption.

119
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:58,185
Who is this alleged female
you reference?

120
00:07:58,352 --> 00:07:59,394
Just some girl.

121
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:03,398
Carina is not just some girl, okay?
She's basically a Swedish supermodel.

122
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,817
The country's greatest export
since Björn Borg.

123
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,069
People mistake me for him
all the time.

124
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:10,155
We dated a couple of years ago,
hooked up.

125
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,574
And just kind of drifted apart.

126
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,076
She's back in town,
thinking about hitting that.

127
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:18,538
Morgie, there's no way
a girl like you could ever get a woman...

128
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:21,583
...like you're describing here.
It seems...

129
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:33,178
Funny though, because if she wasn't
into me, what is she doing here?

130
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:47,692
Hello, can I help you with
a computer or computer-related software?

131
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,363
- What are you doing here?
- You're needed, Agent Romeo.

132
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,282
Well, she seems really into you.

133
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,912
Agent Miller has been working
undercover for the CIA...

134
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,082
...playing the girlfriend of
suspected smuggler Karl Stromberg.

135
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,585
We've learned $10 million was recently
wired into Stromberg's account.

136
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:09,256
We don't know what this weapon is,
but someone's willing to pay a lot for it.

137
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:12,884
- We gotta get it.
- Thanks for being on the case.

138
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,220
My engagement party is today
at Karl's house.

139
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,390
Sarah and Chuck will enter
as my best friend and her boyfriend.

140
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:22,435
- The cover they established at the club.
- Mr. Bartowski, that a problem?

141
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:26,314
- I'm cool. No problem-o.
- And Casey will pose as my father.

142
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:31,736
- Check your math. I'll play your brother.
- That's a bit of a stretch.

143
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:35,115
Yeah, Casey, I think you have dungarees
that are older than Carina.

144
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:38,410
Colonel, you will assume the identity
of Agent Miller's uncle.

145
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,662
Carina's father's
much younger brother.

146
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,958
Karl's storing the weapon in a gold case
inside a vault adjacent to his bedroom.

147
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:48,962
During Karl's toast, Sarah and Chuck
will slip out, break in and apprehend it.

148
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,506
He keeps the key
in a secured area in his pants...

149
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:54,509
- ...which I can easily access.
- I'll bet you can.

150
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:58,513
Karl also just installed a state-of-the-art
security system in the vault room.

151
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:01,558
So I hope the two of you
can handle anything you find there.

152
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:05,437
- Uh, "any" is kind of a broad word.
- Chuck is just being modest.

153
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:09,107
His recent training has equipped him
to handle any security obstacle.

154
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,359
- There won't be a problem.
- Better not be.

155
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,778
This whole mission rides on you,
Chuck.

156
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,363
What a surprise.

157
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,658
Carina is almost 6 feet of pure Swede.

158
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:21,703
That's over 182 centimeters of Lapland,
you know what I mean?

159
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,788
Stop it, Grimes. This is pathetic.

160
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:27,542
As if a hot piece of tuchus like that
would get near a dirty tref like you.

161
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:31,379
- I could totally nail that if I wanted it.
- If you're a stallion, prove it.

162
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,131
Ask her out.

163
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,635
Oh, listen,
I know she's kind of seeing someone--

164
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,846
I didn't see a ring
on her perfect finger.

165
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:43,016
Well, I'm slow-playing it. I just--

166
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,018
You snooze, you lose boobs.

167
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,687
We checked
Chuck's calendar software...

168
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:51,399
...and noticed Ellie and her pin-up
husband are away at some doctor thing.

169
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:56,071
So it is the perfect time for us
to throw you a housewarming party.

170
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:58,740
- I don't know.
- I'll even prepare my special punch.

171
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:03,411
- You'll have home-field advantage.
- Are you ready to say yes, lover boy?

172
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,917
- Yes. Of course, yes.
- Yes, yes.

173
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:11,252
Carina will be there too.
Party is on, nerds.

174
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,921
- Party is on!
- Yeah!

175
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,840
Party, party, party.

176
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:21,054
All right, all right.
Let's take a look here, buddy.

177
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,347
Let me see. Look at me.

178
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,893
Neither. Um, why are you so dressed up?

179
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,895
Date?
Getting back together with Sarah?

180
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:32,774
- It's not a date, and no.
- Well, who is this not-date with?

181
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,278
Huh.

182
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:41,282
- Probably should answer that, maybe.
- Yeah, thanks.

183
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,786
Hi. Yeah. Almost out the door.

184
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,815
Hmm...

185
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:18,486
Here. This charm bracelet looks like
what some sucker in love might wear.

186
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,699
Uh, no, it's not really my thing.

187
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,954
You wanna talk about what happened
with him?

188
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,334
When we wrap this mission...

189
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:36,171
...maybe you should come with me
on my next assignment.

190
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:40,341
I know it's not Burbank,
but you can make the best of St.-Tropez.

191
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,218
Right?

192
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,016
Do you ever wonder
about a different life?

193
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:51,269
You mean like if all this was real?

194
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,774
If we were really getting ready
for my engagement party?

195
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,233
Yeah.

196
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,236
No.

197
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:05,200
- I thought you guys were done.
- Yeah, we're talking a little.

198
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:08,161
Good for you. Glad to hear it.
Is Carina gonna be there?

199
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,622
- You seen my keys?
- I could come with, you know?

200
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,041
Run a comb through my beard.
Takes two seconds.

201
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:16,711
- It's actually not that kind of party.
- Don't worry about it.

202
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,214
Do me a favor, though.
Could you get this to her?

203
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,052
Her invitation to our party. Please.

204
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,640
Fine, I will give Carina your flyer
if you find my keys.

205
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,267
Right, your keys.

206
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:35,021
- Should have known.
- Have fun.

207
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:42,403
Congratulations. You are gonna
have the most amazing life.

208
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:44,906
- You are a very lucky man, Karl.
- Thanks, Chuck.

209
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,741
I'm sure you're gonna be next
up the altar.

210
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,621
- I'd be the happiest guy in the world.
- He really would be.

211
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:59,003
Oh, sweetheart, I wanna introduce you
to my Uncle Johnny, Daddy's brother.

212
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,256
- Kid brother. How are you?
- Nice to see you.

213
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:04,551
It is great to finally meet
one of Carina's family.

214
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:08,012
I'm not too sure
about the, uh, resemblance though.

215
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:12,350
Oh, uh, Daddy and Uncle Johnny share
the same thick neck and square head.

216
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,647
Baby lamb chops, 12 o'clock.
There we go. Ha-ha.

217
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,107
Thanks.

218
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:21,776
The master bedroom access point
is at your 6 o'clock.

219
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,445
We'll move when the room is distracted
by the toast.

220
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:29,033
Sarah, listen. I feel like there's been
this thing hanging over us.

221
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,744
You know, ever since Prague.
I mean, I miss you.

222
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,874
- Will you excuse us for a second?
- Sure.

223
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,376
I miss this. I miss us.

224
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,044
- Karl's on the move.
- Wait.

225
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,630
- I'll be right there.
- Look, look, look.

226
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:45,633
What I'm trying to say is,
even though we're on a mission...

227
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:49,137
...it feels good to hang out together,
to talk as friends.

228
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,638
Kind of like we did before.

229
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:54,309
What is he doing?

230
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:59,397
- I mean, what do you think?
- It's just a cover, Chuck.

231
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,781
What the hell are you doing
to my mission?

232
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:11,242
You and Sarah are supposed
to be a happy couple.

233
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,454
Look, ever since I got back from Prague,
Sarah's been so cold.

234
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:17,999
You idiot. The reason Sarah's cold
is because she loves you.

235
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:23,129
Now, get your head out of your ass
and go be a spy.

236
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,725
Sarah, hey. Sarah, Sarah, Sarah.

237
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:38,686
Carina said something to me.
I really need to talk to you.

238
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:41,022
Okay, Chuck,
we need to focus on the mission.

239
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,192
Carina is getting the key. Come on.

240
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:51,032
I bet you know that toast
by heart now, hmm?

241
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,034
Yeah, pretty much, darling.

242
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,495
You're gonna do great, Smoosh.

243
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,872
Thank you, Smooshy.

244
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,626
Oh, what did a bloke like me do
to deserve someone like you?

245
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:08,216
- Okay, shall we do this?
- Yes, let's do it.

246
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:13,346
I'd like to make a toast
to my beautiful bride-to-be.

247
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,392
Since the first time I met Carina...

248
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:21,020
...I knew I'd found the woman I wanted
to spend rest of my life with.

249
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:25,775
I've never met anyone more real,
more honest, more good.

250
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,403
Not never.

251
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:32,532
A toast to the future Mrs. Stromberg.

252
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,993
Cheers.

253
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:39,163
- I love you, Smooshy.
- I love you, Smoosh.

254
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,589
Um, is that it?

255
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,093
Uh, no.

256
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:56,931
Also, may our first child...

257
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,058
...be a masculine child.

258
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,268
Hear, hear.

259
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:06,190
- Can we talk for just a quick second?
- No time.

260
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,860
Carina, we just got to the vault.
We need more time.

261
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,445
Wait.

262
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:15,783
I just know that my Uncle Johnny
is dying to say something.

263
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,872
- Johnny, come on.
- All right.

264
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,711
I'm not ordinarily a man
of many words.

265
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,713
Or any words, for that matter.

266
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:32,216
But in this case,
I'm willing to make an exception.

267
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:35,928
I remember when I first set eyes
on sweet Carina.

268
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:39,557
I was practically just a boy...

269
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:45,104
...when my big brother brought home
the most beautiful baby girl in the world.

270
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:01,829
- No way.
- I'm so proud of Carina.

271
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:06,959
So beautiful, so giving,
so warm and kind.

272
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,588
Approachable,
so good at conversation.

273
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:13,132
All of those qualities are reflected...

274
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:17,678
...in the man that she's chosen
to be her life partner.

275
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:22,433
Sarah, no. I can't get around these
without setting the alarm off.

276
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,268
- It's impossible.
- You can do this.

277
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:29,649
The Intersect can do this. Just focus
and don't think of anything else. Relax.

278
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:32,610
Okay. All right, I'm relaxed.

279
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,487
Relax, okay.

280
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:42,662
I'm not flashing, Sarah.

281
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,998
- Maybe if we can talk for a second.
- Okay, Chuck, I am right here.

282
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,543
We can talk about
what you wanna talk about later.

283
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,170
We just have to get our hands
on that weapon first.

284
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:53,381
We'll talk, I promise.

285
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:57,236
Okay, now we can talk.

286
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,948
- Whoa!
- Damn it.

287
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:04,368
And I just know that if my brother
were still alive today...

288
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,538
Well...

289
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,959
He'd wanna say
welcome to the family.

290
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,755
And take care of our little girl.

291
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,841
Don't worry, Uncle Johnny.
Deep breaths, let it all out.

292
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,973
- I don't like small spaces.
- Just keep breathing.

293
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,600
Chuck, you're gonna be fine.

294
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,648
Gas. Gas. Gas! There's gas in here!

295
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:36,984
Sarah, I'll be taking exclusively
short breaths from now on.

296
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:44,492
Okay, hold on, Chuck.
I'm gonna get you out of there.

297
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:57,338
Sarah, I don't wanna regret not telling
you everything I need to tell to you.

298
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:00,675
I'm not a normal spy.
You know that, I know that.

299
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:03,594
I'm a regular guy
who works at a Buy More.

300
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,350
And the decision
that I made in Prague...

301
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:14,438
I know it looks like I chose being a spy
over you. That's not what happened.

302
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:20,653
How I felt about you was real.
It was very, very real.

303
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:27,201
I know that you know
how I've felt about you for a long time.

304
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,495
But when Carina told me
what you said...

305
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:34,875
...those three words
I've waited to hear for so long...

306
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:39,171
Look, Sarah, I know--
I know you're probably very hurt.

307
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:43,217
You're probably hurt
I didn't run away with you in Prague.

308
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,228
A toast to Karl and Carina.

309
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:58,482
- Cheers.
- Their love is an inspiration to us all.

310
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:04,030
Sarah, I love you.

311
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,667
Good job recovering the weapon.

312
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:20,004
- How is the asset doing?
- He'll live.

313
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:24,091
What is this thing, general?
I've never seen a weapon like it before.

314
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:27,428
That information
is above your pay grade, Colonel Casey.

315
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:31,599
Agent Miller will return it to Langley
on her way to her next assignment.

316
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,309
You never saw it.

317
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,606
They wouldn't tell me either.

318
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:44,362
Hey, Walker.

319
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,616
Did you think about my offer?

320
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:51,118
I'm still considering it.

321
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,510
- Agent Walker. Is everything okay?
- It's about Chuck's safety.

322
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:09,845
I thought he just needed some sleep.

323
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:13,307
It's about me managing Chuck
and keeping his emotions in check...

324
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,810
...so that the Intersect can work.

325
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:18,646
I think I'm more part of the problem
than the solution.

326
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:22,316
And I think a different agent
might have more success in training him.

327
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,193
Let me be clear, Agent Walker.

328
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:27,530
I don't know or want to know
what happened between you two.

329
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:30,574
But this is your job,
and Chuck's safety depends on you.

330
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:33,869
So get over it
and teach him how to be a real spy.

331
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,588
Well, time to train, Chuck.

332
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:46,841
Let's go.

333
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,679
Lives are on the line.
We need to get the 2.0 working right.

334
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:54,014
You wanna be a real spy?
You need to act like one.

335
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:58,227
I am a real spy.

336
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:02,690
A real spy
would have flashed on the bo.

337
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:05,025
Been able to defend himself.

338
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:11,574
Come on. The program is in the 2.0.
You can do this.

339
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:15,077
It doesn't work, okay?
It's not working. I'm too emotional.

340
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:18,289
- If we could talk quick--
- Learn to ignore your emotions.

341
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:21,125
Spies do not have feelings.
Feelings get you killed.

342
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:24,545
You need to learn to bury them
in a place deep inside.

343
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,383
Sarah, stop.

344
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,388
Come on.
Flash, show me your attack skills.

345
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:39,727
Come on, Chuck, flash. Show me.

346
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:45,608
- No.
- Why not?

347
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:48,402
Because I don't wanna hurt you.

348
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,868
Don't worry, Chuck. You can't.

349
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:12,760
Yeah. I've been tracking her all morning.
She's in Burbank.

350
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:15,471
Hey, seeing as how
you didn't come home last night...

351
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:18,098
...I assume everything went great
with Sarah. Nice.

352
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:22,186
I need to know if you gave the flyer to
Carina. I need her to come to this party.

353
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:26,190
- My whole reputation is at stake here.
- Charles can't save you from this lie.

354
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,275
Not this time.

355
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:32,821
A humiliation like this
will leave a deep-lasting scar. I know.

356
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:35,032
I know.

357
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:46,961
- Is that the girl you fancy, son?
- "Fancy" is not a big enough word.

358
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:50,172
I don't think she's gonna agree
to come to this party, though.

359
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:56,011
And I exaggerated about my relationship
with Carina to the guys.

360
00:25:56,179 --> 00:26:00,474
And truth is, I don't think
she even knows my real name.

361
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:04,061
A fine fish like that don't swim
in a man like yours' ocean very often.

362
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,855
Are you gonna toss your hook
in the water or cut bait?

363
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:11,360
Remember, 730 words
in the Japanese language for yes.

364
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,237
You just need her to say one.

365
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:16,740
Right. Right. Thank you so much.
Thank you.

366
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,910
Martin. I need a favor.

367
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:23,330
My laptop broke.
Will you give this to Chuck?

368
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,627
Uh...

369
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,505
On one condition, okay?

370
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,675
You come to my party.

371
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:38,095
Fine. Whatever.
Just promise you'll give this to Chuck.

372
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:57,448
Smooshy,
you haven't been returning my calls.

373
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:00,868
I'm starting to think
you've been getting cold feet.

374
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:03,996
What's going on, Smoosh?

375
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:09,627
Last night, somebody stole something
very valuable from me.

376
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:13,422
Now, I'm thinking
you're not who you say you are.

377
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,050
I'm thinking you're a spy.

378
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:19,637
A spy? Well, that's ridiculous.

379
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:23,515
It's me, Smoosh. I love you.

380
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,102
I'm not like Carina.

381
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:31,815
Some cold-hearted spy
who throws around words like "love."

382
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:36,153
- I'm gonna kill you, Chuck Bartowski.
- No, Carina. I'm gonna kill Chuck.

383
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:39,031
Don't worry, Smooshy, you're next.

384
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,246
She's got that kinda booty

385
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:48,082
Lift them up
Come here and do me

386
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:51,669
She's got that kinda booty
That'll drive you loony

387
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:56,423
She's got that kind of booty
Back it up and bring it to me

388
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:00,386
- Good news, buddy. Your girl is here.
- She is?

389
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,390
Of course she is.
What did I tell you, huh?

390
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:06,684
- Right.
- All right.

391
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:08,268
Hoo.

392
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:09,978
So good like chewy candy

393
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:13,982
In the middle of M-I-AMI
Come and sit down on my jammie

394
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:19,113
We can do it in a big old bed
No need to give me good old--

395
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:24,451
And she showed up with four guys?
And no beer.

396
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:27,663
Thanks a lot.
Now our party is a sausage fest.

397
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:32,751
Loser.

398
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:37,131
So, what's the news on Carina?
Anything I can do?

399
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:40,134
Every branch of U.S. Intelligence
is looking for her, Chuck.

400
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:43,595
America's best and brightest
are on the case. You just sit tight.

401
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,310
Is this the Chuck Bartowski
apartment?

402
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:53,480
- It's kind of both of ours--
- This is VIP only, gentlemen.

403
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:55,649
Martin, where's Chuck and Sarah?

404
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:59,611
On their way, I guess.
I see you brought some of your relatives?

405
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:01,822
- Call Chuck. Tell him I'm here.
- Okay.

406
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:05,159
All right, did I--? Did I not say VIP?

407
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:09,621
I'm gonna allow that one. Boys, easy,
easy. We don't wanna get physical.

408
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,960
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, where are you?

409
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:16,670
I'm in the middle of something.

410
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,631
Hold on a second.
Please, I need your advice about Carina.

411
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:22,634
- What about Carina?
- Well, she's here.

412
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:27,264
I took Big Mike's advice from El Segundo
School of Finance, asked her to come.

413
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:29,516
She said yes.

414
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:32,478
You're telling me Carina
is at our apartment right now?

415
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:36,315
That's not the problem. Shows up with
her boyfriend and three Aqua Velvas...

416
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:40,194
...throwing everybody around.
You know, I can't believe it.

417
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,196
Yeah. I can believe it.

418
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:46,533
She humiliated me in front of my friends
and I think I'm gonna go tell her off.

419
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,494
No, no, no, Morgan, stay away.

420
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:54,458
- Why?
- Because it's dangerous... ly uncool.

421
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,126
Women love mystery, buddy.

422
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:59,463
You gotta be aloof.
Promise me that you will stay away.

423
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:03,675
Yeah. All right, whatever.
I'll try your way. Thanks.

424
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,973
Those studs
are gonna ruin our chances...

425
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:12,893
...with the medium-hot chicks
from Underpants Unlimited.

426
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,562
We don't stand a chance, Jeffrey.

427
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:18,816
I've been drinking this Jail Juice
since I was in diapers.

428
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,901
Built up a tolerance.

429
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:25,906
I'll challenge them to a drinking contest
and they'll pass out.

430
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:30,744
By process of elimination,
we land the ladies.

431
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,038
- Yes.
- I love it.

432
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:39,002
Bottoms up, fellas. Grab your own.
Help yourselves.

433
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:42,422
Oh, hey, Skip. Thank you.

434
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,843
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

435
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,052
Whoa! Whoa!

436
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,346
Easy, easy. Gentlemen, gentlemen.

437
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:52,933
- It's okay. Easy. He's just hammered.
- Get him out.

438
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,935
Easy, gentle giants.

439
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:58,021
I plan to join him at the bottom
of this glass. Gentlemen...

440
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,357
...lift up your skirts
and start your engines.

441
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,609
Well put, Jeffrey.

442
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:11,034
Juice? Another one.

443
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:17,374
Jefferson, no need to waste these.

444
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,334
To you, my friend.

445
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:33,265
Guy's got no tolerance.

446
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:47,613
It's nice to see you think so much
of the ring I bought you.

447
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:53,160
You try anything like that again
and I'll kill you right here, Smooshy.

448
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:08,300
Whoa, hey, stop. What are you thinking?
You can't go out there blasting.

449
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:10,802
My friends are out there.
Half the mall is there.

450
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,804
- Got a better plan, Bartowski?
- I do.

451
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:16,141
Carina is still alive, which means
she hasn't given Karl the case.

452
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:19,311
Which means we have something
to negotiate with peacefully.

453
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,438
Chuck's right. Where's the weapon?

454
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:24,441
Unbelievable.
Cuddling with my girl in my house?

455
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,320
All right, that's it.

456
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,907
Bearded bogey incoming.

457
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:36,203
Martin.

458
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,789
Did you speak to Chuck?

459
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:45,212
First things first.
My name is not Martin.

460
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:48,924
It's Morgan. Morgan Guillermo Grimes.
Memorize it.

461
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:53,512
Just because you're a woman I'd give
a non-vital organ to make love to...

462
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,472
...doesn't give you the right to--

463
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,391
- Wait a minute.
- And humiliate me.

464
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:00,519
- Who is this todger?
- You gotta be kidding.

465
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,020
Do me a favor. Take a hike.

466
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:04,022
- Right.
- And take the slabs of beef.

467
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:07,651
You don't have time
to deal with a dead body, sweetheart.

468
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,070
Okay, pull out, boys.

469
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:12,072
- Back it up, bitches.
- What?

470
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,075
- Morgan, maybe you should leave.
- Yeah.

471
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,411
My house, my party.
I think you need to leave.

472
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:19,413
Yeah, that's right, hottie. Bounce.

473
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:23,542
All right? Fun fact for you: 730 words in
the Japanese language for the word yes.

474
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,876
No word for no.

475
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:28,171
If there was a Japanese word for no,
I'd be saying it to you now.

476
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,841
Instead I'll leave you with this:
sayonara.

477
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,343
You wanted Chuck to have this?

478
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,262
No!

479
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:39,349
Give it to him yourself. I'm done.

480
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:46,189
Let's go. Don't let the door
hit you on the ass on the way...

481
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:51,778
No one's ever said no to me before.

482
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:57,117
Idiot. Now they have both Carina
and the weapon. No negotiating now.

483
00:33:57,285 --> 00:34:00,746
Wait. There's gotta be something.
There's gotta be a contingency plan...

484
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:03,290
...in case enemy agents
infiltrate my apartment.

485
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:06,543
A button that calls the cavalry
so they can clear everyone out?

486
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:10,213
- Where's the button?
- Me. I'm the button.

487
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,227
Break it up. The party's over.

488
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:26,438
Damn kids. Get out of here.

489
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:30,150
That's it, go on. Get out of here.

490
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:32,736
Get out.

491
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:43,413
Here. You're gonna need a weapon.

492
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:46,458
No. No guns.
I hate guns. You know that.

493
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,795
Think of it as a bo.

494
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:07,104
- Sorry to disturb your sleep, sir.
- No problem.

495
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:10,315
Drop your weapons.

496
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:15,320
Put it down.

497
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,491
I should have known
by your paint-peeling speech...

498
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,701
...Uncle Johnny was a narc too.

499
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:25,163
- Drop the gun, lover boy.
- I'm having the worst day of my life.

500
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:27,791
So I don't give a fat crap.

501
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:32,838
Sarah, drop your guns.
Casey, drop your guns.

502
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:35,590
Trust me.

503
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:47,477
Get their guns.

504
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:16,590
- Let her go, Karl.
- You shoot me, I shoot her. I don't care.

505
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:19,759
This bitch has broken my heart.

506
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:22,429
- She dies.
- I get it, man. I get it, okay?

507
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,183
You took a chance.

508
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:29,227
You loved someone,
maybe for the first time in your life.

509
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:32,689
All you've ever done before
is shut off your feelings.

510
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,399
You bury them deep down inside.

511
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:38,945
Because in your profession, in your line
of work, it's a liability, right? It's...

512
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:42,949
It can certainly be a liability.

513
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:46,453
And I know.

514
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:50,415
I know you think you messed up your life
because you opened up your heart.

515
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:54,794
But maybe you helped her
open up her heart in the process.

516
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:59,049
Maybe because you loved her...

517
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,595
...she's learned how to love too.

518
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:11,811
He's right, Karl.
I did fall in love with you.

519
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:14,731
Maybe at first,
you were just an assignment.

520
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,274
But not anymore.

521
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,571
Really? Ah!

522
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,120
Yeah, right, stupid.

523
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:32,123
Spies don't fall in love.

524
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:03,822
Don't touch it, Mr. Bartowski.

525
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:08,285
I was thinking
that maybe if I looked at it, I could flash.

526
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:09,536
No, thank you, Chuck.

527
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:12,122
All I need to know
is that it's back in safe hands.

528
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:15,542
Colonel Casey will stay with it
until a team arrives to secure it.

529
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:16,876
That is all.

530
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:26,928
We can't keep this a secret anymore.
It's too dangerous.

531
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:30,557
We need to tell them.
They need to be prepared.

532
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,434
Shaw.

533
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,270
Please.

534
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:55,415
I'm listening if there's something
that you wanna say.

535
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:58,335
I'm sure there's somewhere else
you'd rather be.

536
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:01,796
No, I'm good here, for now.

537
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:09,471
You're right. I'm not a real spy.

538
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:12,599
I'm emotional,
and that makes me a liability.

539
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,267
Not always.

540
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:17,020
You might not have flashed,
but you did your job.

541
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,980
You got to Karl, you talked him down.

542
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:22,525
And if it weren't for your emotions,
he would have killed Carina.

543
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:27,781
It's quite a mess we made.

544
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,284
Yeah.

545
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:34,120
I'm really hoping we can clean it up.

546
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:35,955
Maybe.

547
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:38,500
But you're on your own
with the courtyard.

548
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:40,710
I'll see you at work tomorrow.

549
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,508
Morgan.

550
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:52,305
Dude, I'm all alone
cleaning up your mess.

551
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:57,143
This better have been worth it, buddy.

552
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:08,154
Wow.

553
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,073
Wow.

554
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,160
Why did you...?

555
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:18,998
No one's ever said no to me before.
It's sexy.

556
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:24,254
Was I--? Or was it...?

557
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:27,340
Eh, I've had better.

558
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,342
- Yeah, of course.
- But not many.

559
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:33,054
Yes.

560
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,060
So...

561
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:42,105
...St.-Tropez doesn't sound appealing
to you?

562
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:45,358
Uh, incredibly.
But I think I'm gonna stay here.

563
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:47,360
At least for now.

564
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:50,363
I thought you'd say that.

565
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:53,199
Here. A little going-away present.

566
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:56,744
You should take a look at it.

567
00:40:57,997 --> 00:40:59,581
Okay.

568
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:03,626
- So I guess I'll see you around, huh?
- Yeah.

569
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:09,716
Bye.

570
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:24,397
Look, Sarah, I know--
I know that you're probably very hurt.

571
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:27,942
You're probably hurt that
I didn't run away with you in Prague.

572
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,403
I did that and I'm sorry.

573
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:34,240
You have to know that you were
everything that I ever wanted.

574
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,284
But how could I run away with you?

575
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:39,245
How could I be with you
knowing what I'd turned my back on?

576
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:43,082
Knowing that what I had in my head
could help a lot of people.

577
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,254
And you're the one that taught me...

578
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:51,508
...that being a spy
is about choosing something bigger.

579
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:54,802
It's about putting aside
your own personal feelings...

580
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:57,472
...for the greater good,
and that's what I chose.

581
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,850
I chose to be a spy for my friends
and my family and you.

582
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:05,104
I chose to be a spy because...

583
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,983
...Sarah, I love you.
