1
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:04,420
Hi, I'm Chuck.
Here are things you need to know:

2
00:00:04,587 --> 00:00:07,172
The Ring used me as a decoy.
You said I was safe, bro.

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,924
- We need to get away.
- Where?

4
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:10,718
Doctors Without Borders.

5
00:00:10,885 --> 00:00:14,263
- I'm a spy, buddy.
- My best friend is a spy?

6
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,306
That's the best news I've ever heard.

7
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,778
Dismissed.

8
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,408
Lieutenant Alexander Coburn.

9
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:38,579
Thank you for your service.

10
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:42,041
You have not qualified for training
with Special Operations Command.

11
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:45,085
You're returning home with your unit
at 0800 tomorrow.

12
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:47,129
Dismissed.

13
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,049
Dismissed.

14
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:01,977
Tic Tac?

15
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:04,605
I'm sorry, colonel?

16
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:07,566
I know it's silly,
but they remind me of home.

17
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:12,988
Go ahead and keep them.

18
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:16,408
I have a feeling
you're gonna be out here a while.

19
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:22,664
How would you feel if I told you that
there was a covert black-ops team...

20
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:26,418
...of America's finest snipers, rangers,
and men willing to do anything...

21
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,670
...to protect this country...

22
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:30,422
...and that team wanted you?

23
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,674
I'd say that sounds
like a dream come true.

24
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:35,177
Then I'd say
you have quite a choice to make.

25
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:39,348
You either go home to your family...

26
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:42,935
...or you become the soldier
you've always dreamed you could be.

27
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,688
So tell me, Lieutenant Coburn...

28
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,486
...you ready to die today?

29
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,789
I'm glad you took my call.

30
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:08,293
General Beckman is gonna give you
and your team a trace-cell mission...

31
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,171
...to test the CIA's security system.

32
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:14,883
I need you to pick something up for me
while you're there.

33
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:25,060
I know you'll make the right decision.

34
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,564
You always do.

35
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:43,245
02200 and 2, uh, p.m.

36
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:49,543
NSA Agent John Casey in his apartment,
speaking to an elderly gentleman.

37
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:54,089
And I detect a hint
of Midwestern with--

38
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,549
I hear footsteps.

39
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:58,719
Coming up from behind me.
Closer, closer now.

40
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,346
Whoever finds this video,
I want you to--

41
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,601
It's just you, Chuck.
I thought you were KGB.

42
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:06,852
Maybe even a ninja.

43
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,022
Although in that case,
your footsteps would've been quieter.

44
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,440
- Probably.
- Yeah.

45
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,567
- What are you doing?
- Oh, spy work.

46
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,402
I think Casey's getting a mission.

47
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,114
If Casey was getting a mission, I'd know
because I'd be getting a mission.

48
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,742
And you're being kept out of the loop
for a reason.

49
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,619
- Spy work is dangerous, buddy.
- I--

50
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:30,125
Pleasure working with you again,
old friend.

51
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,932
Working on what?

52
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,892
Good morning, team.

53
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,478
Your task this week
is a trace-cell mission.

54
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:52,648
- Excuse me, a trace cell?
- It means spy-proofing our security.

55
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:55,943
The CIA's most valuable assets
are held in a vault...

56
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,819
...at our Los Angeles facility.

57
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:01,907
You'll need to break through 15 levels
of security to get there.

58
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:05,327
- Will Shaw be joining us?
- No, Shaw's in D.C.

59
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:08,622
Agent Walker, you'll need
to catch a later flight to meet him.

60
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,333
You have your orders. Good luck.

61
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,584
This is just great.

62
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,628
So now you're gonna go
meet Shaw in D.C.

63
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,381
Does everyone have a secret mission
within a mission?

64
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,677
It's not a mission, Chuck.
This time, it's personal.

65
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,263
Oh, right, right, of course.

66
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,683
Well, that would make sense
why I was kept out of that loop.

67
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:30,143
My work is here, Chuck,
so please stay focused.

68
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:33,272
We are up against the best security
in the world tonight.

69
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,107
Our own.

70
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:51,665
- That's the door to Level 2.
- A hallway. Well, seems easy enough.

71
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,250
Ah.

72
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,303
- Oh.
- Here's where you flash.

73
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,512
Just relax.

74
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,473
You've got time,
nobody's banging down the door.

75
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:31,705
Mission accomplished.

76
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,249
Pace yourself, Chuck,
we've got 14 more levels.

77
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,964
That was manageable.

78
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:52,267
Walker, watch the door.

79
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,854
Hey, shouldn't we stick together?

80
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,273
No, always gotta have somebody
watch your back.

81
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,984
I got yours.
The box we need's around here.

82
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:06,031
There, there, there.

83
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,661
Did you just take something
out of that box?

84
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:53,912
No.

85
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:57,624
I literally just watched you close it.

86
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:03,505
Hey, hey, look, if you're working on
some secret side mission, tell me, okay?

87
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:08,510
You breathe a word to anyone,
you're as good as a dead man.

88
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,429
You understand?

89
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,354
Is everything okay?

90
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,067
Yeah.

91
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:07,903
- Chuck.
- Hey.

92
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,613
I need you to do me a solid.

93
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,948
Help Ellie commit
to Doctors Without Borders.

94
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:15,076
- What? I thought that she did.
- Yeah, well, so did I.

95
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:18,163
I think it hit her today
that it meant leaving L.A. and you.

96
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,790
She's gonna come to you,
and I need you to back me up on this.

97
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:26,421
- That's probably her now.
- Okay. Okay.

98
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,008
- Is Devon here?
- Hi.

99
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,343
Chuck...

100
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:33,303
...I got it.

101
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:38,600
You got it. What is it? What is this?

102
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:45,607
Ellie-- Ellie, this is amazing. Oh, my God.
Neurology fellowship at USC.

103
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:49,611
- You've wanted this since middle school.
- I know, I know. But what do I do?

104
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:53,365
Doctors Without Borders is the only thing
Devon has been excited about in weeks.

105
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,535
Excuse me.

106
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,456
Yeah, well, you know,
sometimes your dream job...

107
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,542
...isn't always
what you expect it to be.

108
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:07,879
Unfortunately, your mission
at the CIA facility was a day too late.

109
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:11,800
The vault had already been compromised,
and a drug called Laudanol was stolen.

110
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,386
Scientists were able
to create a prototype pill...

111
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,763
...that could suppress emotions
in soldiers...

112
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:20,892
...make them stronger,
faster, fearless.

113
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,813
Wait a minute. No fear?
Could that help me flash?

114
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:28,400
Well, maybe, but then
you wouldn't feel anything, Chuck.

115
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:34,155
- Right, but I could work perfectly.
- We'll never know unless we get it back.

116
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:37,158
We think this might have been
an inside job.

117
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:41,871
Only a handful of our people knew the
Laudanol was being kept in Box 092407.

118
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:46,751
Yes, I get it now. You're good.
You are good, general.

119
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,671
You guys, you are good, very good.

120
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,173
- This is a test, right?
- Bartowski.

121
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:55,719
First was the solo mission,
then turning an asset, now this time it's:

122
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:58,179
"Chuck, will you betray your country...

123
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:02,392
...or will you turn in your friend
and partner, Casey, for stealing the pill?"

124
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,854
I'll play ball, okay? Guilty. He did it.

125
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:13,236
Are you positive you saw Colonel Casey
take the pill, Mr. Bartowski?

126
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,363
Yeah.

127
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,118
No. No.

128
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,871
No, I would actually
not use the word "positive."

129
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,082
It was very poorly lit in that...

130
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:30,378
I'm wrong half the time, so...

131
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:33,340
Colonel Casey,
would you care to respond?

132
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:45,268
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hang on a second.
Let's just all take a breath here, okay?

133
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:48,647
John Casey is one
of the most loyal spies out there.

134
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:52,734
He would never do anything
to jeopardize the CIA. Casey, tell them.

135
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:59,616
With all due respect, general...

136
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:03,662
...I will exercise my right to remain silent
under the Fifth Amendment.

137
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:06,623
What?

138
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,126
What are you doing?

139
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:13,922
Agent Walker, please relieve the colonel
of his weapon.

140
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,979
John, you wanna tell me
what's going on?

141
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,832
"Leopard Ted" would be better
as an expansion pack.

142
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,417
I need your help.

143
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:54,129
Yes, I set the DVR
to record the Mork and Mindy marathon.

144
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:58,842
This is not that.
This is the spy related, okay?

145
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:03,304
Did you happen to record
Casey's conversation last night?

146
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:04,556
That would depend.

147
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,684
No, don't worry, don't worry.
You're not in trouble.

148
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:11,020
- I actually need your help.
- Oh, sweet, I knew you'd come around.

149
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:13,898
Yeah, sure, absolutely.
What do you need, audio or video?

150
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,233
Whatever.

151
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,861
Twenty one hundred and forty-three p.m.

152
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:20,989
There's a chill in the air
and a hint of vanilla.

153
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:25,493
Sorry.

154
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,579
A man enters Casey's apartment.

155
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:33,001
- Is that static?
- Carrots, actually.

156
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:38,006
Well, I'm sorry,
I get hungry on a stakeout.

157
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:50,059
- Holy crap.
- What is it, Chuck? I want in.

158
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:53,688
Morgan, trust me, in this case,
the fewer details you know, the better.

159
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,694
Okay. Call me if you need me.

160
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:11,706
Hey, show some respect.
This guy was one of the best we had.

161
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,209
Sorry, ma'am.
Still no sign of the Laudanol.

162
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,003
Sarah.

163
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,967
I just flashed. Casey is being played.

164
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:26,888
His old commanding officer is named
James Keller, high up in Special Ops.

165
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:30,058
He's the guy
who turned Casey's former sensei...

166
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,976
...because he's a member of The Ring.

167
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,895
- What?
- Casey doesn't know anything.

168
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,564
- We gotta tell him who Keller really is.
- We can't.

169
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:39,776
Casey committed treason,
and he's still refusing to talk.

170
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:44,572
They're moving him to Thailand,
outside of U.S. torture jurisdictions.

171
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,825
- When?
- Tomorrow morning.

172
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:50,787
Okay, we gotta break him out
before then and clear his name.

173
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,957
If we do this and get caught,
we're gonna be tried for treason.

174
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:58,044
You're gonna lose everything
and never get a chance to be a real spy.

175
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,255
Is that what you want?

176
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,841
It's Casey.

177
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,426
I was hoping you'd say that.

178
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,269
You're okay missing your flight
to D.C.?

179
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:18,106
Yeah, Shaw can wait, Casey can't.
He's in the holding cell on Level 15.

180
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,775
We have to break through the security
we spy-proofed.

181
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:24,279
It's only been 24 hours.
I'd be surprised if they'd fixed anything.

182
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:27,657
All right, then. Time to save the day.

183
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:45,216
- Chuck? Are you okay?
- Well, that wasn't there before.

184
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:54,017
Alert the general.
We've captured two infiltrators.

185
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:56,728
I see you've encountered
my new security measures.

186
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:06,362
- Well done. Well done.
- Yeah, really, excellent work.

187
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:10,742
You deserve a medal for adjusting
all of these security measures so quickly.

188
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:13,745
Yes, General Beckman,
the spy-proofing is excellent.

189
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,246
Who to thank?

190
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:20,335
Fitzroy. Stanley Fitzroy.
It means "son of the king."

191
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,922
Did you get that, general? Fitzroy?
"Son of the king."

192
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,424
She knew that as well.
That's incredible. Yeah.

193
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,551
Okay, great.

194
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:32,889
My name is Charles Carmichael,
and this is my partner, Sarah Walker.

195
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,392
Uh... We're secure.

196
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,062
Please forgive the intrusion
and condescending tone.

197
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:41,439
I wasn't informed
that you two were coming...

198
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,067
...but, then,
that must have been the point.

199
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,986
Do you like what I did on Level 1?

200
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:50,698
- Very impressive.
- Very. Very, very.

201
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:57,413
In fact, I think we'd both love to see
what you've done with Level 15.

202
00:15:57,581 --> 00:16:01,125
Well, let me show you.
I'll give you the tour.

203
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,301
I thought you'd be happy for me.

204
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:13,888
Babe, I am, but if we do Doctors
Without Borders, we can save lives.

205
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,557
We can save lives here in L.A.,
next to my brother.

206
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,726
I talked to Chuck.
He thought it was great.

207
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:22,563
Really? I find that hard to believe.
I told him about USC and he was happy.

208
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:25,608
Well, then I guess
we'll go talk to Chuck.

209
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,743
- Good to see you too.
- Third opinion never hurts.

210
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:43,084
- I agreed to do Doctors Without Borders.
- Ellie agreed to this. She said, "I'm in."

211
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:46,254
- I found out about my fellowship...
- Doctors Without Borders...

212
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,298
- ...is every doctor's dream job.
- ...which is my dream job.

213
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:52,593
Devon, it appears to me
that you're being completely selfish.

214
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,929
Morgan, sidebar, now.

215
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,180
Just a sec, babe.

216
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,309
- You can't tell Ellie to stay here.
- Why?

217
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:04,272
If you had all the information I had,
you'd know it's not safe for her here.

218
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,857
If you had the intel I have...

219
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:09,944
...you'd know that it is in fact
the safest place for her to be.

220
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,779
What exactly do you mean by that?

221
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:15,074
Nothing. Chuck's here.
He'd look after her.

222
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,661
Yes, but Chuck's job...

223
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:23,124
...can sometimes be more demanding
than most would expect.

224
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,625
Indeed, sir, indeed.

225
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:28,963
Sure, Nerd Herding does often call
for more than just computer installs.

226
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:32,467
- Do you know? Do I know what?
- Do you know? What do you think I know?

227
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:36,637
- I don't think you know what you think.
- On three, we both say what we know.

228
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:39,057
- Okay.
- One, two, three.

229
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:42,351
- Chuck's a-- My God, you know.
- Chuck's a-- My God, you know.

230
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,562
- When did you find out?
- A while, bro.

231
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,398
- Man, it is so cool, huh?
- Yeah, it's awesome.

232
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:51,194
But every time I go on a mission,
I put Ellie in danger. I can't have that.

233
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:53,237
Right. Man, I didn't think about that.

234
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:56,699
- Wait, you went on missions?
- You haven't?

235
00:17:56,867 --> 00:18:00,369
What? Of course. Dude, are you kid--?
I just never saw you out there.

236
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,830
Mm-hm.

237
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:08,377
I've been thinking, kids in L.A.,
they don't need your help...

238
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:11,839
...with their fancy designer jeans
and Lady Gaga sunglasses.

239
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:15,843
I say far, far away is where a doctor
could do the most good.

240
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:18,554
You should go and do
Doctors Without Borders, right?

241
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:29,023
So that was 14, and here's Level 15.

242
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,859
Glad you're pleased
with my new security measures.

243
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:34,362
- You know, I'm kind of your biggest fan.
- Really?

244
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:38,032
Yeah, yeah, I read and file
all of your mission reports.

245
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,077
Remember you reverse-engineered
an antidote to that weapon...

246
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:44,205
...and kissed Casey
only to realize it was all for naught?

247
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:47,583
That must have been exciting and scary
at the same time, huh?

248
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:50,628
Can we skip the details for now?
We'll get into that later.

249
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:54,674
Right now, I'm really interested
in how you've secured this holding cell.

250
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,051
I'm the newest security measure.

251
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:00,096
I have the only key card
in the whole building.

252
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:03,641
This card is the only thing
that stands between the bad guys...

253
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,059
...and the holding cell.

254
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,271
Stanley.

255
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,816
- We're gonna need that key card.
- But it...

256
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:15,611
Oh, no.

257
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:18,239
I'll swallow the key card if I have to.

258
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,577
Well, that's weird. We're still out here.

259
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:25,079
- How is the alarm going off?
- Somebody's coming.

260
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,748
- We don't have time for this.
- Time for what?

261
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,584
Ooh!

262
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,836
- Was that absolutely necessary?
- Yes.

263
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,259
There. Look, Casey.

264
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,266
I really hope that wasn't me.

265
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:06,621
Don't take another step.
We just want the colonel.

266
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:09,373
Casey, you don't understand.

267
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,877
Keller is not who you think he is.
He's part of the Ring.

268
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,754
Let's go, John.

269
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,053
I know.

270
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,403
Can't believe Casey's a member.
What are we supposed to do?

271
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:43,324
We gotta get out of here first.
Worry about finding the Ring later.

272
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:53,251
When three of my agents are arrested
for treason in 24 hours...

273
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,002
...it reflects poorly on me.

274
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:58,047
- Look, general, Casey--
You don't know John Casey.

275
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:01,884
Not the way you think.
His real name is Alex Coburn.

276
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:04,428
We've unsealed his file.
This is what we learned.

277
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:08,015
Alex Coburn faked his death
in Honduras in 1989...

278
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:12,270
...the same day that John Casey
was recruited for NSA Black Ops...

279
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,021
...by a Colonel James Keller.

280
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:16,691
Keller recruited him again,
this time for The Ring.

281
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:19,777
And it's crucial the Laudanol
doesn't fall into their hands.

282
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:24,198
The only reason you're not in prison is
I have a mission only you can accomplish.

283
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:28,119
Find and capture Colonel John Casey,
dead or alive.

284
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,545
Whoa!

285
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:38,838
Shh! Don't say a word.

286
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,051
- Casey?
- Yeah.

287
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:48,723
Oh, I get it, I get it.
This is some kind of mission, isn't it?

288
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:53,436
Yeah. How would you like to be a part
of a very important, very secret mission?

289
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:57,606
Yeah, yeah. Can I get a cool call name
like Condor or Lady Fingers?

290
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:59,400
Yeah.

291
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:04,280
Three years. Three years of missions,
training, I'm his friend.

292
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,992
- How can all of that have been a lie?
- I don't know. Some people change.

293
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,493
You move forward as a spy...

294
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:12,913
...and the line between what's right
and wrong becomes more gray.

295
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:16,667
You don't know what to believe in
or who to believe in.

296
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,007
I thought you had changed.

297
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:27,678
What do you mean?

298
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,390
Look, I know
that you wanna be the perfect spy...

299
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:37,313
...and I know what it means to you
and what you've sacrificed to get there.

300
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:43,986
But please don't lose that guy
that I met three years ago.

301
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,909
Don't give up on the things
that make you great.

302
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,334
I'll always be that guy.

303
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:12,640
- Sarah, I--
- We should focus on the Laudanol.

304
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:17,395
So the only reason that Keller would go
to all that trouble to break Casey out...

305
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,188
...would be if he didn't have it.

306
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:22,066
We get to it before Casey,
we got a shot at catching him.

307
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,151
There's nothing left in the apartment.

308
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,487
- What about Buy More?
- No, Casey's smarter.

309
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:29,573
He knows he would never get past
those cameras undetected.

310
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,700
He would have to use somebody.

311
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:34,829
And that someone would have to be
either desperate, stupid...

312
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:37,957
...or just plain willing to do anything
to impress him.

313
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:59,687
Planet of the Apes, huh?
Planning on watching that alone?

314
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:03,691
Yeah, well, you know me,
I can't get enough POTA.

315
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:04,900
Liar.

316
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:08,529
You hated the original
because their upper lips never moved.

317
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:12,366
I just...
Yeah, I know, it's just so unrealistic.

318
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,910
Did Casey ask you to come here
and get something?

319
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:18,456
- No. Never. What?
- Really? Really, is that so?

320
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:21,917
And could that something be in the case
that you're holding now?

321
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:24,378
That is absurd.
Now you're just making stuff up.

322
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,255
Now you're just trying to...

323
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:29,133
Listen, this is my first mission.
I don't wanna screw it.

324
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:32,803
Now, Casey, he told me that
I can't tell you anything, and I won't.

325
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,054
I am a rock.

326
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:36,724
If you give me that case now,
I promise that later...

327
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:41,270
...I will answer all questions
that you have about any of my missions.

328
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:45,774
- In sordid detail?
- Promise.

329
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:53,407
You're making the right choice, okay?
You're making the right choice.

330
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,952
Sarah, I got it.

331
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:11,258
Where's Grimes?

332
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:16,639
You convinced the little rodent
to give you the case, didn't you?

333
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:18,933
I knew he was weak.

334
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,436
Tell me where it is now.

335
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,858
Don't make me do this, Bartowski.

336
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:36,283
- Don't shoot.
- Give me the case and I won't have to.

337
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:43,999
I believed in you.

338
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,086
I trusted you.

339
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,965
- Chuck.
- I know everything, Casey.

340
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:53,175
I know everything, okay?

341
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:55,386
I know that you used
to be Alex Coburn.

342
00:25:57,305 --> 00:26:01,308
I know that you work for James Keller,
that you stole the Laudanol for The Ring.

343
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:08,357
The only thing I don't know is why.

344
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:26,417
Alex Coburn.

345
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:30,504
I had a fiancée,
and now she thinks I'm dead.

346
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:36,427
And if I don't turn over the Laudanol
to The Ring, they're gonna kill her.

347
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:46,270
Her name's Kathleen McHugh.

348
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:50,190
Twenty years ago, she was the girl
I was gonna marry, the love of my life.

349
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:54,028
To be a spy, to protect our country,
I had to give up that life.

350
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:56,447
She's gonna die
because of a decision I made.

351
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,449
No, we're not gonna let that happen.

352
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:02,286
If I don't deliver the Laudanol
in the next hour, they're gonna kill her.

353
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:06,206
- What are we waiting for?
- If I don't show...

354
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:09,710
- ...Keller will know something's wrong.
- Chuck will go to Kathleen's.

355
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,004
Sarah's right, I'll go.
Give me the address.

356
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:16,175
I'll sneak her out, put her in a safe house.
I will protect her, Casey, I promise.

357
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:19,803
You could be charged with treason.
You didn't know I was Alex Coburn.

358
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:22,640
I don't care who you were.
I know who you are.

359
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,853
And you're not in this alone.

360
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,982
Keller still expects you at the meet.
What are we gonna do?

361
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,404
Let's go to a meeting.

362
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:53,253
I'm alone, I'm unarmed.

363
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,506
All I've got is this here Cuban.

364
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:58,342
- You mind?
- Smoke it.

365
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:24,868
- Hi. Miss McHugh?
- Yes, may I help you?

366
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,328
I'm with the gas company.

367
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,497
I was just checking your meter here
out back...

368
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,792
...and I do detect a gas leak,
sorry to tell you.

369
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,585
So I need you to leave with me.
Come on.

370
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:35,129
Oh.

371
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,550
- Back inside the house.
- But I thought you said--

372
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:43,220
Well, ignore everything I said previously.
The leak is outside the house.

373
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,931
- What?
- Trust me, it's my job to smell these.

374
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:48,934
Been doing it for years.
The whole cul-de-sac could blow.

375
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:52,688
So I need you back inside.
Back inside now. Inside, inside.

376
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:57,651
Okay, this is--
This is getting kind of weird.

377
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:02,906
- Who are you really?
- I'm sorry. I promise I'm not crazy.

378
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:08,454
- This is for your own good.
- Huh? Hey!

379
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,206
Hey, let me out of here!

380
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:24,219
Hello, Alex.

381
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:27,222
You got the Laudanol?

382
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,773
I knew I could count on you.

383
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:40,652
Good soldiers always follow orders.

384
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:43,989
You wouldn't be in this mess...

385
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:47,785
...if you'd done what I told you
20 years ago.

386
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:49,870
You were supposed to let go of her...

387
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:52,122
...stop caring.

388
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:55,918
Tic Tac?

389
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,712
What the hell is this?

390
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,380
Your breath stinks.

391
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:06,011
You think you're just gonna walk
out of here? I got five men outside.

392
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,222
The one thing I always taught you:

393
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:10,766
Make sure you have someone
watch your back.

394
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:13,644
I know.

395
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,399
Five against one.

396
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:59,731
You didn't think this through.

397
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:03,694
You can't kill me or Kathleen will die.

398
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:07,030
- You'd never call them off.
- You're right.

399
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:24,965
They're at the house.

400
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:30,554
Gas company, Miss McHugh.

401
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:34,016
I'm the gas company.
Guys, how far out are you?

402
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,936
Five minutes.
Anything immediate, handle yourself.

403
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:40,480
- Everything is immediate.
- Then you have to flash.

404
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:43,692
- I can't. There's too many of them.
- Take the pill, Chuck.

405
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,487
- What pill?
- You gave him the pill?

406
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:48,780
It's in your pocket.

407
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:51,700
Laudanol was developed
to calm emotions, eliminate fear.

408
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:56,121
Chuck, it can make you the Intersect
you were always supposed to be.

409
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,501
Gas company, Miss McHugh. Open up.

410
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:09,968
Oh.

411
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:15,974
Chuck.

412
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:22,230
I just checked the meter.
Everything's fine.

413
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,442
Hey! Hey, come on, now!

414
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,945
Open this door!

415
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:31,907
Oh, thank you so much, I--
Hey, wait a second. What the--?

416
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:36,286
What--? Who are you?
You're not from the gas company.

417
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:49,883
I'm not afraid...

418
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:51,677
...of any of you.

419
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:05,584
Chuck. Chuck, stop.

420
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:59,054
Do I know you?

421
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:04,810
Kath, I'm sorry,
I can't come home sooner.

422
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:06,103
I got one more mission.

423
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:10,148
- I'm gonna really be able to help people.
- You don't have to explain.

424
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:13,735
You love what you do
and you're good at it.

425
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:17,155
I just want you to know,
if something happens to me...

426
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:18,824
...no matter what, I love you--

427
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:22,702
You're never one to get emotional,
so don't let your guard down now.

428
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:27,582
That way you can get back to me
in one piece.

429
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:30,669
Got it?

430
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:33,713
Yes, ma'am.

431
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:39,511
And when you do come back,
I've got some news--

432
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:44,891
Tonight at 2200, Lieutenant Alex Coburn
will be killed in battle.

433
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:48,186
He'll die a hero
and will be given a hero's funeral.

434
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:52,190
From this point on,
your name is John Casey.

435
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,695
Make it a good life, soldier.

436
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:02,576
The authorities just arrived,
Miss McHugh.

437
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:07,289
Mom.

438
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:09,457
Alex.

439
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:14,838
- What's with the police cars outside?
- It's okay. It's okay.

440
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,966
I'll be all right. I'm okay.

441
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:21,303
Casey, wait.

442
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:24,222
- You can't just--
- What's dead is dead.

443
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,224
It's too late now.

444
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:31,438
It's okay, honey.

445
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:39,279
Despite the success of the
mission, Colonel Casey...

446
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:42,782
...you abused your privileged position,
and if you were anyone else...

447
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,701
...you would be right back in jail.

448
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,997
But you are not just anyone...

449
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:52,959
...and I'm about to give you
your second second chance...

450
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:55,503
...which is two more
than most people get.

451
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:59,424
- Thank you, general.
- A second chance as a civilian.

452
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:06,431
Um... But, general, Casey has given
his entire life to this country.

453
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:09,476
I mean, surely you can't just
make him start over.

454
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:11,436
He's done it once before.

455
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,815
He shouldn't have a problem
doing it again.

456
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,822
For the final time...

457
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,824
...you are dismissed.

458
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:33,166
Good luck, John.

459
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:44,052
Mr. Bartowski...

460
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:51,476
...please escort Mr. Casey
off government property.

461
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:16,251
I want to commend you, Agent Walker,
for your work with the Intersect.

462
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,545
He seems to need you less and less.

463
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:22,090
Yes, Chuck has certainly changed...

464
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,719
...and he's well on his way
to becoming the perfect spy.

465
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:29,931
A while back, you requested a transfer
out of Burbank, and I haven't forgotten.

466
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:34,269
There's an empty seat on my flight
back to D.C. if you'd still like to go.

467
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:36,730
We could discuss it on the way.

468
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:40,025
I leave in an hour
if you'd like to join me, Agent Walker.

469
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,401
Thank you.

470
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:56,249
- Hey, stranger.
- I'm sorry, you are...?

471
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:59,753
Your brother, who you never see.

472
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:03,048
How are you? You okay?
You look exhausted.

473
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:06,926
I am, it's this--
It's this Doctors Without Borders thing.

474
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:11,097
I think Devon really wants to do it,
and I did too.

475
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,476
So I think I'm gonna do it, Chuck.

476
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:18,855
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

477
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:23,818
USC Neurology, that's kind of been
your dream ever since you were a kid, El.

478
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:28,323
I know. I know. But dreams change.

479
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:32,243
And if there's one thing I know for sure,
it's that I wanna be with Devon.

480
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:35,455
That might require some sacrifice
from both of us...

481
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,292
...but he's the best choice
I ever made.

482
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:43,421
There you are, El.

483
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:46,091
Hey.

484
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,468
- Can I steal you away?
- Yeah.

485
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:51,471
Love you. Both.

486
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:09,781
Babe, I realized
that I didn't congratulate you...

487
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:14,035
...on getting the fellowship,
and that was only my first mistake.

488
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:17,122
But I should have talked to you first.

489
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:20,166
If this is important to you,
then it is important to me.

490
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:23,169
I'm sorry I lost sight of that.

491
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,047
Babe, take the job.

492
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:29,134
We'll make it work. Hmm?

493
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:30,343
Together.

494
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:45,817
See? This space can work.

495
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:48,695
It'll be great for civilian life.

496
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:51,656
I mean, take a look around.
You got a...

497
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:54,200
Got a nice chair.

498
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:05,336
You know, you can still go back.

499
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:11,593
The general made the terms
of my dismissal crystal clear.

500
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:18,975
I was talking about Kathleen.

501
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,899
She lives right around here, man.

502
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:30,570
And you got a daughter, Casey.

503
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:37,410
And I made my decision between love
and love of country a long time ago.

504
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:40,788
And it was the right decision for me.

505
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:47,253
Now you have to make a decision
whether that's the right one for you.

506
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:50,882
Walker's a good woman.

507
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,304
It's still not too late.

508
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:08,775
D.C.'s beautiful this time of year.

509
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:11,819
- You from this area?
- No.

510
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:16,241
But I'm thinking of moving here.
