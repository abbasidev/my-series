1
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:04,211
I'm Chuck. Here's things you need to know:

2
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:07,464
That was the hospital.
They just offered me a sabbatical.

3
00:00:07,632 --> 00:00:09,717
I'm, uh, Justin,
camp security coordinator.

4
00:00:09,884 --> 00:00:12,511
Devon. Oh, baby, you're burning hot.
Justin!

5
00:00:14,764 --> 00:00:17,891
They left. I took care of the husband,
made it look like malaria.

6
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:19,768
She doesn't suspect a thing.

7
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:22,104
Guys, we gotta get this place fixed up.

8
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,440
Actually, I was gonna start
with our place.

9
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:29,653
- If your offer for me to move in stands.
- Yeah.

10
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:39,038
It's official.
There is absolutely nothing on TV.

11
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:41,790
Yeah, Monday nights can be
a bit of a wasteland.

12
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:45,627
President Jakaya Kuti of Zamibia
arrived in Los Angeles today.

13
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:49,048
On agenda are diplomatic meetings
and a performance of Beethoven...

14
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,216
...tomorrow by the L.A. City Symphony.

15
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:52,843
Ugh. Sounds like Beckman.

16
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:55,929
Hey, jackpot.

17
00:00:56,097 --> 00:01:00,017
Oh, no, no, no, you've made me
watch this before. This is ridiculous.

18
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:04,188
Sarah, please, you could learn
a lot from spies like these.

19
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:06,315
Are you kidding me?
Look at these people.

20
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:09,109
They are breaking
about 17 different rules of protocol.

21
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:13,113
Sweetheart, I'm not actually implying
that you could learn anything...

22
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:17,284
...about being a spy from Chevy Chase
or Dan Aykroyd. I was making a joke.

23
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,912
Remember? Jokes?

24
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,632
I love you.

25
00:01:57,325 --> 00:02:00,077
- I'm sorry, I must have fallen asleep.
- Chuck.

26
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,705
I love you.

27
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:08,043
Oh, Sarah, it feels so good
to finally hear you say that.

28
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:14,133
Sarah, look outside. Quick.

29
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,595
Finally. I'm so hungry.

30
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:21,890
Isn't it great we found a place
that delivers Zamibian food?

31
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,142
Zamibian?

32
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,521
- Hello, Chuck.
- Shaw?

33
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,967
Oh, what?
Did you have another bad dream?

34
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:03,015
- It was about Beethoven and Zamibia.
- Chuck, I'm worried about you.

35
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,517
Every time you fall asleep,
you have a nightmare.

36
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:09,104
But this one was trying
to tell me something.

37
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,774
- Tell you what?
- General, The Ring is going to try...

38
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:16,904
...and kill the president of Zamibia at
the Beethoven concert tomorrow night.

39
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,281
Tomorrow night.

40
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,241
Could have done this in the morning.

41
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,952
You know how dear my sleep is to me,
Bartowski.

42
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,871
Look, I'm sorry, Casey and general.

43
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:30,083
I know that it's very late
and you are obviously very...

44
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:34,421
...busy. Um, but the president of Zamibia
is in danger.

45
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,340
Did you flash on something, Chuck?

46
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,009
I--

47
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,053
Mm. Uh...

48
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,721
I know it because of my dream.

49
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,474
Your-- Your dream?

50
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,684
I've been having
very, very vivid dreams.

51
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:50,896
First, I saw the news reports on Kuti,
president of Zamibia...

52
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,522
...but then I saw Beethoven.

53
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,900
Then Shaw was there,
delivering Zamibian food.

54
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,278
Then he tried to kill everyone.
Obviously, Zamibian president...

55
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:01,114
...is gonna be assassinated by The Ring
at the concert.

56
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,367
General, permission to slap Bartowski.

57
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:05,911
He had a bad dream.

58
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,414
General, Chuck has been under
a lot of stress with these dreams--

59
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:12,542
No, Walker,
I think I understand the situation.

60
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,170
And, to be honest,
it makes perfect sense.

61
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:18,632
Thank you. Thank you, general.
Thank you very much, appreciate that.

62
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,175
What's our assignment?

63
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:24,263
Chuck, I'm assigning you
to see a CIA therapist.

64
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:29,059
These dreams you're having are getting
in the way of your work and our sleep.

65
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:32,437
No. This is crazy. A therapist?
I don't need a therapist, okay?

66
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,565
Therapists are for people
who have real problems. I'm fine.

67
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,567
Are you comfortable, Chuck?

68
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:42,572
No. No, not particularly, no.

69
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:47,202
How does this work exactly?
I've only seen movies and stuff like that.

70
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,872
Do you ask me questions? I just answer--
Or is it like word association...

71
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,167
...where you would, like, say "father" --
No, give me another word.

72
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:57,629
Do you want to talk about your father,
Chuck?

73
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,092
This wasn't my idea, you know?

74
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:06,722
So, no, I don't really wanna talk
about anything, to be perfectly honest.

75
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,435
Despite your sparkling
conversation skill.

76
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,648
That was-- That was a joke.
I was just--

77
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,859
Just going to town on that pad,
aren't you?

78
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,986
Just a little joke.
Okay, fine, I'll talk.

79
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,947
Ahem. Where do I start? Uh--

80
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,658
Well, okay, my girlfriend just moved in
with me.

81
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:30,120
The best part of my life, really.
Rock-solid relationship.

82
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:34,207
Not a problem there. A little distant.
She could be more communicative.

83
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:37,252
She doesn't say "I love you" back.
Never done this before.

84
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,005
Even though I know she loves me,
I'm just noting it...

85
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,216
...because I know, I know
that she loves me. I know that.

86
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:45,594
Do you?

87
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,349
Let's get back to your dreams.

88
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:54,686
It's my belief they are a product of your
subconscious interacting with Intersect.

89
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,940
Wait, what?

90
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:00,692
How--?

91
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:06,114
- You know about the Intersect?
- I'm a CIA psychiatrist.

92
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:08,158
I know everything about you, Chuck.

93
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:11,244
As far as the Intersect goes,
we've known for some time...

94
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:14,164
...that it could spur a host
of side effects.

95
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,457
Like dry scalp?

96
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:19,127
Because I have had
annoyingly dry scalp since--

97
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,630
The Intersect
is extraordinarily powerful.

98
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:26,218
It has the potential
to overwhelm your mind.

99
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,638
With the end result akin
to something much like...

100
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,765
...insanity.

101
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,683
Insanity?

102
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:36,395
Doc, I'm not insane.

103
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:40,273
You're not sure about that. It could be
the Intersect is doing its thing...

104
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:44,444
...while I'm sleeping. And if that's true,
then President Kuti is in danger.

105
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:45,821
Slow down, Chuck.

106
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,697
Something is gonna happen tonight.

107
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:51,118
And if I'm there, we could stop it
and then I'm not crazy.

108
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:54,121
I'm sorry, Chuck,
but I can't let you do that.

109
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:58,458
Until further notice, I'm removing you
from field duty.

110
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,927
There he is. Welcome home, pal.

111
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:54,139
- It's good to be home.
- Hey, look at you. All right.

112
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:57,225
You know what? Malaria aside,
you look pretty awesome.

113
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,810
I actually feel pretty great.

114
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,604
I'm ready to get back out there.

115
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:03,857
- I had an important realization.
- That looks don't get you everywhere.

116
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,277
No, Morgan.

117
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,946
You can die as easily
from a mosquito in Africa...

118
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,907
...as you can from a spy in Burbank.

119
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:15,368
This is what I'm talking about.
Listen, fear is the mind killer.

120
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,746
- Yeah.
- Right.

121
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:21,750
You can't live scared, bro.
Not for yourself. Not for anyone.

122
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:29,299
I think it's jammed a little bit
or something. I guess it's broken.

123
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,472
Hey, uh, Ellie.

124
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,516
- I heard Devon has malaria.
- Yeah.

125
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:38,892
Nasty stuff.

126
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:41,394
Had it four, maybe five times myself.

127
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,271
Tough to say.

128
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:48,193
Those meds aren't gonna help him.
What he needs are African snake herbs.

129
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:53,281
- I might have some back at my place.
- I'll keep that in mind, John. Thank you.

130
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,493
- Okay.
- Okay.

131
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:58,453
Crazy.

132
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,539
You're not crazy.

133
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:05,752
Don't freak out.

134
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,129
Chuck, you in there?

135
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:10,715
Come in.

136
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:12,509
- Hey.
- Hey.

137
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:16,388
- How was the doctor's?
- Uh, good. Great, actually.

138
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,808
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. What about you?
Hear anything from Beckman...

139
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,476
...about anything?

140
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,228
Chuck, I know I'm your partner...

141
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:26,940
...but I'm also your girlfriend.
And you can tell me anything.

142
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,861
I know that. Of course, I--
Of course, I know that.

143
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,823
Honestly. Hey, I'm fine, okay?

144
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:39,369
Just a solid good night's rest
and I'm right as rain.

145
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:43,665
Which I don't totally understand
because rain is kind of all over the place.

146
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:47,961
- Glad you're okay.
- Thanks.

147
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,511
Nothing like absorbing local culture.

148
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:00,223
President Jakaya Kuti of Zamibia
will be in town today.

149
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:03,518
The tiny African nation seeks
to improve its rocky...

150
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:06,271
Okay, Chuck.
You're watching more cable television...

151
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,524
...than is healthy for a young man.
Talk to me. What's going on?

152
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:14,029
Buddy, I've been having the strangest
and most vivid dreams I've ever had.

153
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:18,199
- How vivid are we talking about here?
- Well, they have to do with that guy.

154
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:23,371
I guess he's handsome.
I don't know what you're talking about.

155
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:26,625
Me neither. He's president of Zamibia
and he's gonna be at the symphony.

156
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:30,629
The dream I had made me think--
Made me know that he's in danger, man.

157
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:34,549
Some doctor thinks it's just the Intersect
playing with my subconscious.

158
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,384
I'm right and nobody believes me.

159
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,053
Sarah doesn't believe you?

160
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,096
S-- Uh.

161
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:41,556
I'm trying not to involve Sarah.

162
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,351
Things are good between us.
Last thing I want is her to think I'm--

163
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:45,894
- Crazy.
- Yeah.

164
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,897
Well, here's the thing.
If this guy really is in danger...

165
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:52,734
...don't you think it's crazy not to help
the president of Zanfiriabiha?

166
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,819
- Zam-- Uh.
- Zamibia.

167
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,572
Yeah. Anyway, I'm gonna help you.

168
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:01,076
- Thanks, buddy, thank you.
- What's your pant size, Chuck?

169
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,080
I'm just gonna say it.

170
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,831
I need a woman.

171
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,751
It's been far too long, Jeffrey.
A man has needs.

172
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,921
- What's the plan?
- I'll be hitting on all applicable women...

173
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:17,759
...in Electronics, DVDs, and all around
the entrances and the emergency exits.

174
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,969
You're leaving me Home Appliances?

175
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:21,680
It's full of lumpy housewives.

176
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:27,102
- My favorite.
- You're welcome.

177
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:32,982
OMG, Jefferson, is it a mirage?

178
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,696
No, my eyes do not deceive me.
It is indeed her.

179
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:46,788
It is Anna Wu. I knew the day she left
to break Morgan's heart...

180
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:50,875
...she'd come back to break mine.
Crush it.

181
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,338
Hi, guys. Long time no smell.

182
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,298
She remembered our smell.

183
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:01,553
Annabelle, have you lost weight?
Two, three grams?

184
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,973
Hawaii is treating your body very well.

185
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,016
- Thanks. Is Morgan around?
- Who?

186
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,644
- What now?
- Morgan Grimes.

187
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,604
He does still work here, doesn't he?

188
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,819
- Hey.
- Two tickets to the L.A. City Symphony.

189
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:21,364
Two tuxedos from the mall.
No cummerbund. Call me crazy.

190
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:25,577
Well done, you nailed it. Gonna head out
the back. Meet me at the Herder in five.

191
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,996
- Done.
- All right, let's go.

192
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:32,000
Well, I hate to be the one
to tell you this. I don't really.

193
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:36,504
But Morgan is in a,
um, very bad place.

194
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:40,675
- Oh, my God, is he okay?
- No. He's focused, responsible, driven.

195
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,928
- Pains me to see a man end up like that.
- It's pathetic.

196
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:47,515
Ha. Nice try.
He can't have changed that much.

197
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:10,997
- Whoa, Anna, what are you doing here?
- In L.A. for a few days. Came to see you.

198
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,918
- There are some things--
- Sorry, don't mean to be rude. I just--

199
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:18,129
- Duty calls.
- You mean "Call of Duty"?

200
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:21,508
Come on, Morgan, your game can wait.
Why are you in a tux?

201
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:24,719
Uh, tux, right.
I'm going to the symphony with Chuck.

202
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,722
The symphony. With Chuck.
My God, can you guys get weirder?

203
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,266
At this point, probably not.
I'd love to catch up.

204
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:34,229
Why don't you call tomorrow morning,
all right? And, uh, you look good.

205
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:37,816
Wow.

206
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,329
Excuse me.

207
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:56,000
Hey, buddy, buddy, that's Kuti up in
the president's box there. Our mission:

208
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,003
Make sure nothing happens to him.
Remember, Morgan...

209
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:03,299
- ...my code name is Charles Carmichael.
- Yeah, I got it. I got it. Mine's Cobra.

210
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:06,094
Okay, let's do this.

211
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,013
Great. I'm on a mission with Cobra.

212
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,100
Maybe I am going crazy.

213
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:15,603
Are you sure you want the box set of ER?

214
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:18,940
Ha. Hey, but all 15 seasons?

215
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:23,695
Uh, yeah, I know, Devon,
it's the best show ever.

216
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:27,282
Okay, fine. I'll see you later. Bye.

217
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,451
Ellie?

218
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:38,042
Justin? Oh, I'm sorry. This is--
This is bizarre. Why aren't you in Africa?

219
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:41,129
Did you--? Did you--?
Did you get malaria too?

220
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,798
No, I'm actually here to see you.

221
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:47,302
Can we go somewhere and talk for a bit?
Somewhere private?

222
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,237
Let me ask you a question.

223
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:09,741
This whole Anna thing, you know,
I mean, you think she wants me back?

224
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,118
Better question, actually:
Do I take her back?

225
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,996
Didn't she break your heart?
You did hit rock bottom.

226
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:17,999
Well, bottom, yeah, but rock bottom?
Come on.

227
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,709
Shh.

228
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:24,631
Later, all right, buddy? Remember,
we're on a mission. Eyes on the president.

229
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:26,966
- Shh!
- Sorry.

230
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:32,013
But she's kind of like the love of my life.
When you want to talk about Sarah...

231
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,849
...we talk about Sarah.
I thought you could help me out.

232
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,727
- Hey, hey, that is not fair.
- Shh!

233
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,868
You work for the CIA?

234
00:15:55,955 --> 00:16:00,959
I know it's a lot to process, but meeting
you in Africa wasn't an accident.

235
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:05,046
Wanted to talk to you, but your husband
got sick before we could fully brief you.

236
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,715
This is about your father, Ellie.

237
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:11,886
My father.
My father, are you kidding me?

238
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,638
My father is--

239
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,974
He's eccentric, sure.

240
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:19,310
But the work Stephen J. Bartowski did
in molecular computing...

241
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,896
...has turned out to be brilliant.

242
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:25,400
Which is why as we speak, there are
some bad people looking for him.

243
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,070
Including a man named John Casey.

244
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,658
He's an NSA double agent. He's been
monitoring you for another organization.

245
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:39,539
John Casey works with my brother.

246
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:42,583
You don't have to take my word for it.
Just...

247
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,585
...keep an eye on him.

248
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:49,549
I caution you about telling anyone
about this.

249
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,427
But what about my brother
and my husband?

250
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,512
Here's the problem.

251
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,933
They're gonna tell you you're crazy.
As crazy as you think I am right now.

252
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,813
We came to you
because we need you, Ellie.

253
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,691
Your father needs you.

254
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,281
What are you doing here?

255
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:17,368
I thought you had a date with Chuck.
Saw him leave the store in his tux.

256
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,620
Chuck's in a tux?

257
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:27,879
Pull up surveillance in the store entrance
and the parking lot from 16 minutes ago.

258
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:30,798
There, there. Roll it back.

259
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,300
There, freeze it.

260
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:39,390
Concert with Zamibian president. Chuck
is gonna try prove us wrong about Kuti.

261
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,893
I'm gonna kill them both.

262
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:49,776
Hey, hey. Chuck.

263
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,569
Why are you onstage?

264
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:55,490
What, buddy? I'm not onstage.

265
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,964
You shot me, Chuck.

266
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:25,103
What are you doing here?
What are you trying to tell me?

267
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,981
The dream isn't about me, Chuck.
It's about a scientist, Dr. Kowambe.

268
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:32,944
- I love you.
- Intersect.

269
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,994
Oh, my God, that's him.
That's the guy who's gonna kill Kuti.

270
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:44,497
- You serious? How do you know?
- I had another dream.

271
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,374
- I gotta get up to the president's box.
- Shh!

272
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,168
Okay, listen, ma'am, put a sock in it.

273
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:50,837
You, Morgan, stay in the seat.

274
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:53,840
- What? I could be attacked.
- You're not gonna get attacked.

275
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:56,843
- There could be a sniper.
- Fine, fine, fine. Here.

276
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:02,181
Take my backup tranq gun.
For life-or-death situations only.

277
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,023
There.

278
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,735
You take Bartowski.

279
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,572
I got the little elf.

280
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,201
No, Chuck, stop.
I can't let you do this.

281
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:26,080
Sarah, I had another dream. The guy
who's gonna kill Kuti is in the box now.

282
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,999
You should've told me. I could help.

283
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:33,379
Sorry, I didn't wanna get you mixed up
in all this dream stuff until I had proof.

284
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:36,424
I love you. Right now I need you
to believe I'm not crazy.

285
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:44,015
Okay, well, let's get into that box.

286
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:56,027
Stand up and walk out of here quietly
or I'll kill you and drag you out of here.

287
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,112
Your choice.

288
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:04,035
- You--
- What are you reaching for, Morgan?

289
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,705
I've been authorized
to use this tranq gun.

290
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,625
I don't want to. I consider us
as friends now, but I will use this--

291
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,629
Okay, here we go. Shh, shh.

292
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,135
Good evening.
Routine CIA weapons sweep.

293
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,890
- What is the meaning of this?
- That's him. That's the guy right there.

294
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,642
- Dr. Kowambe?
- Yeah, Dr. Kowambe.

295
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:29,644
Mr. President, who is this person?

296
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:36,609
- Chuck, take it easy, please.
- I'm taking it easy. Taking it very easy.

297
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,069
Stop!

298
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:43,658
This man is Africa's
most respected scientist.

299
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:51,582
This is preposterous. You could at least
have had the pretty one frisk me.

300
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:09,684
- Out of your mind? What are you doing?
- It's not an assassination attempt.

301
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:13,020
He had Ring intel in his mouth.
The tooth, tooth! Find the tooth!

302
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:16,941
This man is clearly insane.
Have this man arrested.

303
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:20,361
There's hidden data in the tooth.
I can explain everything.

304
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:24,365
Guys, guys, help me! I'm not crazy!

305
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:26,534
Sarah!

306
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,710
Explain how it's possible that last night...

307
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:38,170
...Chuck, aided by the world-class spy...

308
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:41,299
...that is Morgan Grimes,
managed to elude you...

309
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:45,136
...and cause an international incident that
the president of the United States...

310
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,930
...had to apologize for. In Zamibian.

311
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,433
Tricky language.
Lots of clicks and vowels.

312
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,727
General, how is Chuck doing?

313
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:56,981
At the moment, Dr. Dreyfus believes
Chuck's condition...

314
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:00,651
...is worse than originally diagnosed.

315
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,988
Originally diagnosed?
I-- I don't understand.

316
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:09,118
I'm sorry. But the doctor believes
the Intersect...

317
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,078
...is overwhelming Chuck's brain.

318
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:15,333
His mental deterioration
may be unavoidable.

319
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:17,793
He told me he was fine.

320
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:22,214
Know that we will do everything possible
for him.

321
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,302
I care about him too.

322
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,975
We'll go this afternoon.

323
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,771
Nothing will make him feel better
than seeing you.

324
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:52,995
- I can't believe this is happening.
- It's happening, Chuck.

325
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:57,458
Disturbing as it may be, you're currently
a patient in a psychiatric institution.

326
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:01,045
Best to come to terms with that
sooner than later.

327
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:03,839
Wow, you really know
how to make a guy feel better...

328
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:05,341
...about his situation, doc.

329
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:09,637
You should meet some other people here
with serious psychiatric issues.

330
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,722
This is Lewis.

331
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,100
Although he currently
prefers the name Merlin.

332
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:18,187
Is that right? Merlin, like the--?
Like the wizard?

333
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:23,067
What you in for?
Is it something, uh, sexual?

334
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,820
No. No, it's not. Not sexual at all.

335
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:28,322
- I've been having troubling dreams.
- Sexual?

336
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,157
Non-sexual troubling dreams.

337
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:33,786
- Has my team contacted you yet?
- Ugh. Don't hold your breath.

338
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:36,122
I've been waiting for my team
since '93.

339
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:37,998
That's enough, Lewis.

340
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,918
What? His team? What team?
Who is this guy? He's nuts.

341
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:43,129
His spy team.

342
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:48,342
This is a CIA facility.
Everyone here used to be a spy.

343
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,928
As I don't have to tell you,
it's a stressful job.

344
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,722
People tend to crack.

345
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:58,686
Everyone here. Spies. Like me.

346
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,776
John?

347
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:08,112
Anybody home?

348
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,995
Hi, Ellie. What's up?

349
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:19,999
Hi, John. Um, I just remembered
that you had mentioned something...

350
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,376
...about herbs for Devon's malaria.

351
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:26,422
- Right. Uh, I'll check.
- Okay.

352
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:40,394
Here you go.

353
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,815
Make sure he takes them
with some nice, warm goat milk.

354
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,901
Okay, thank you.

355
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:48,736
Ah.

356
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:57,036
- Whoa, El, everything okay?
- Okay.

357
00:24:57,204 --> 00:25:00,372
I need you to listen very closely
and I need you to promise me...

358
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:03,542
- ...that you're not gonna freak out.
- Okay.

359
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,839
I have reason to believe that
our neighbor, John Casey, is a very...

360
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,592
...very bad man. And we need
to get far away from him.

361
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,386
Babe, gotta get that story
about him getting drunk...

362
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:18,224
...and peeing himself out of your mind.
He was in a bad place. It happens.

363
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:22,102
No, Devon, I was just in his apartment
and he has guns. Very big guns.

364
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,480
We have to do something.

365
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:29,443
Okay, okay.
Casey has some serious guns.

366
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:35,908
Is that creepy? Yes.
Is that illegal? Sadly, no.

367
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,828
You don't believe me.
You don't believe me.

368
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:43,749
It's just--
It sounds a little crazy is all.

369
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:48,879
- You think that I sound crazy?
- Come on, El.

370
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:52,466
How about I make you a cup of tea?
Chamomile, maybe?

371
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,468
Less caffeine, but still so delicious.

372
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,136
Ha-ha-ha?

373
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:01,559
Yes, okay, I-- I'm sure that I do.
I do sound crazy.

374
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,435
Tea is great. Thank you.

375
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:11,527
How are you doing there, pal?

376
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:15,489
- Is there anything we can do for you?
- Yeah, as a matter of fact.

377
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,536
Need you
to get some evidence analyzed.

378
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:23,956
That scientist? He's out there,
he's working for The Ring, I'm sure.

379
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,958
Please, Chuck, the way you're talking.

380
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,127
Come on. It's me.

381
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,796
I need to show you something.

382
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:42,766
Sarah, give me your hand.

383
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:46,437
Give your boyfriend your hand.

384
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:01,410
- Is that--?
- Yeah, the tooth.

385
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:05,205
- Is it yours?
- What? No. That's crazy.

386
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:08,292
It's Dr. Kowambe's tooth
and it's not real.

387
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,338
It's fake. It contains Ring intel.
Secrets, plans, something.

388
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,341
- In the tooth?
- Yeah. Try to keep up, Casey, okay?

389
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:19,011
You need to get that analyzed ASAP.
The tooth is the key.

390
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:22,640
The truth is in the tooth.

391
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:28,020
Well, we'll, uh-- We'll check that out
and you get some rest there, pal.

392
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:32,775
We'll come back
and visit you tomorrow.

393
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,403
Chuck.

394
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:40,282
Sarah, you can't give up on me, okay?

395
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,955
I won't. I'll get it tested.

396
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:52,544
Time to go, Chuck.

397
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:30,582
Walker, I hope he's right too, but
don't be disappointed if Bartowski's--

398
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:33,502
Stop it. He's gonna be right.

399
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,385
Nothing abnormal.

400
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:44,513
Just a tooth.

401
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:47,099
Chuck was wrong.

402
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,853
Mm. I'm sorry.

403
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,739
Excuse me. Does this come in burgundy?

404
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:05,951
I believe that does come in burgundy.
I'll check in the back for you.

405
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:08,245
- What's going on? Where is Chuck?
- Not now.

406
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,539
Listen, please, please, please.

407
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:14,126
You gotta tell me. Just let me know
he's okay. Casey, please.

408
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:19,006
They got him in a lockdown
in a psychiatric facility.

409
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:21,675
Seems the Intersect's giving him
a bit of hard time.

410
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:24,678
What? No, man, no. That's crazy.

411
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:29,475
Morgan, there you are.
Sorry to bother you again...

412
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:32,728
...do you have a second?
I get that you're assistant manager--

413
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:37,107
I'd love to. I'd love to. I just--
Now is not really a good time, so...

414
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:39,026
You look good.

415
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:44,740
Dissed twice by Morgan Grimes?
I can't believe this is happening.

416
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:48,535
Right there. Diagonally. Ha-ha-ha.

417
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:50,120
Oh, thank you.

418
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,789
- Hello?
- Chuck.

419
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:56,168
Hey, hey, hey, Sarah.
Hey, hey.

420
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:59,213
Hey, so, uh, what did you find out?

421
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:03,717
Chuck, we ran every test possible...

422
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:08,722
...and I'm sorry, it's just a tooth.

423
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,474
Are you sure?

424
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:14,186
Yeah, but even though you were wrong,
it doesn't mean anything.

425
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:17,397
The important thing
is to stay positive.

426
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:22,361
Everything's gonna be okay.

427
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,155
I know.

428
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,285
Thanks for trying.

429
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:48,262
- May I help you?
- I hope so.

430
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:50,973
I'm here to see a Charles Bartowski.

431
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:58,939
There's no record of Dr. Dreyfus
authorizing any after-hours visits.

432
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:04,778
So if you don't mind, I don't want
to have you escorted from the building.

433
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,822
Of course.

434
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:08,824
That will not be necessary.

435
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:15,414
Find me Bartowski.

436
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:27,801
- Good evening.
- Let me guess.

437
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,012
You're here because of Chuck.

438
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:34,308
Doctor, I know that there has to be
something more to his condition.

439
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:36,852
He can't just be deteriorating
in this way.

440
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,187
Why? Because you care about him?

441
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:42,816
No. You don't understand.
He's not like other people. He is...

442
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,030
...incredibly special.

443
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:51,658
Ah. Especially to you, I gather.

444
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:54,077
He needs to be okay.

445
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,747
I-- I need him to be okay.

446
00:31:56,956 --> 00:32:00,000
I'd like to go to the hospital tonight
and talk to him.

447
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:05,172
Try and figure this out,
and then help him somehow, you know?

448
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,844
Please.

449
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:15,891
I love him.

450
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,268
Ever tell him that?

451
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:22,689
Please, doctor, I'm begging you.

452
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:24,983
You're not the only one.

453
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:41,041
I'm glad the doctor wants to see me
because I sure wanna see the doctor.

454
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,377
Hey, whoa, there's no need
to be rough or physical.

455
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:45,587
- Jeez.
- Mr. Bartowski.

456
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:52,052
Oh. Not the doctor
I was expecting to see.

457
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,930
Why did you take my tooth?

458
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:00,978
More to the point,
why did you take the wrong tooth?

459
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,938
What? What, the...?

460
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:06,274
- The wrong tooth?
- The data is in a tooth.

461
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:10,237
I believe this is the fake one
you are looking for.

462
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:14,408
I was-- I was right.

463
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:17,619
I was right. Well, I was wrong.
I was wrong.

464
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:19,788
Clearly, I was wrong, but I was right.

465
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:22,249
This is great news.
That means I'm not crazy.

466
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:25,961
Yes. It also means
as soon as you tell me...

467
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:31,091
...where you got your information,
and rest assured, you will tell me...

468
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:34,344
...you are going to die.

469
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:37,139
Oh, that's not great news.
That's a giant needle. Bad, bad.

470
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:40,517
- Colored liquid, even worse.
- Yes, it's one of my favorites.

471
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:45,939
Tetraclydine,
a designer psychotropic cocktail.

472
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:56,825
God!

473
00:33:56,993 --> 00:34:01,455
In around 10 minutes, you're going to be
extremely forthcoming.

474
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,213
Dr. Dreyfus. Thank God.

475
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:22,017
Guys.

476
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,518
Guys.

477
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,647
Guys, guys, help me, help me.

478
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:28,899
I need you.

479
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:33,153
- Awesome.
- Take him back to the room.

480
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:37,949
Ah.

481
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:49,169
Restrain him.

482
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:53,757
Ugh. I don't feel so good.

483
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,008
Let him go!

484
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:58,512
Or suffer the wrath
of Merlin and his army.

485
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,600
Spies, attack!

486
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:20,450
Damn.

487
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:23,537
- It was a good idea, Merlin.
- It's over.

488
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:26,039
No one believes you.

489
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:30,544
No one's coming for you.

490
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,774
Chuck.

491
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:58,238
Well, well.

492
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,240
Looks like it's good we came.

493
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:02,075
You came back for me.

494
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:04,286
I'll always come back for you.

495
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:11,585
So will Merlin, Chuck. So will Merlin.

496
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:20,760
It seems you're owed an apology,
Agent Bartowski.

497
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:22,429
You were right about Kowambe.

498
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,639
He was illegally harvesting
human organs...

499
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:27,893
...experimenting with genetic
manipulation and reengineering.

500
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:31,188
He was scheduled to meet
a Ring operative to sell this research.

501
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:32,856
Well, that's fantastic.

502
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:38,278
Not the organ-harvesting stuff,
obviously. That's very, very sad.

503
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:40,280
So I have a clean bill of health?

504
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:45,577
It would seem that way, Chuck,
but I can't actually clear you.

505
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,080
Well, then, who can?

506
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:52,834
So, what did we land on here?

507
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:57,297
That, uh, my dreams have the potential
to work in concert with my flashes?

508
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,382
Is that where you think we landed?

509
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,134
Oh, come on, doc.

510
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:04,095
Level with me.
Am I cleared for duty or not?

511
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:07,891
You were right, Chuck. Your dreams
were caused by the Intersect.

512
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,351
I'm clearing you for duty.

513
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:11,311
- All right.
- But...

514
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,272
But? But what? Why is there a "but"?

515
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:19,986
But your dreams are also proof of stress
the Intersect puts on your brain.

516
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:23,782
And it is my belief that that stress
will continue and intensify...

517
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:29,120
...likely leading
to serious mental deterioration.

518
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,708
Um...

519
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:42,050
What does that mean exactly?
Am I okay?

520
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:46,012
This is a new science.

521
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:47,931
Time will tell.

522
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,982
But if I may, Chuck...

523
00:37:57,149 --> 00:38:01,528
...I think it's something you should
discuss with your partner, Agent Walker.

524
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:07,617
Thanks, doc.

525
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:18,461
Morgan Guillermo Grimes,
I refuse to be denied an audience...

526
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,380
...with Buy More's assistant manager.

527
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:24,467
If you run off on me one more time,
I swear, I'll call corporate.

528
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:27,345
She could want you back, man.

529
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:30,974
That could be an improvised explosive.
Be extremely cool around that.

530
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:35,312
I owe you an explanation. I'm so sorry.
Last few days have been insane.

531
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:38,440
I've been trying to get a second
of your time to give you this.

532
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:42,068
Some stuff you left behind in Hawaii.
Thought you may want it back.

533
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,158
I'm okay without it.

534
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,786
Well...

535
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:55,749
...here's something else
you may have forgotten.

536
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:01,921
I gotta hand it to you, Morgan.
You know how to play a girl.

537
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:06,468
Well, you know, some men have it and---
What are you talking about? I don't--

538
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:09,095
You know what they say about
not knowing you want something...

539
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:11,639
...until you can't have it?
It's true.

540
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:13,808
You've changed, Morgan.
I want you back.

541
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:17,812
Wow. Really?

542
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:21,983
If it took me running
to realize that I'm somebody you want...

543
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:24,319
...I don't think
you're the person I want.

544
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:27,906
So, yeah, you're right.

545
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:29,991
I have changed.

546
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:32,035
I'll see you later.

547
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:37,040
I don't mind leftovers.

548
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,629
- Hey, Sarah, hey. We need to talk.
- Sure, but--

549
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:46,216
- No, look, this is very important.
- I love you.

550
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:50,261
It shouldn't have taken me this long
to say it, but I've never felt this way.

551
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:53,807
Before you, the only future
I could think about was my next mission.

552
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:57,644
And now all I can think about
is a future with you.

553
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:01,064
I love you, Chuck.

554
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:05,402
I love you too.

555
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:20,500
So, what did you wanna tell me?
Is it about the doctor? What did he say?

556
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:23,044
He said that...

557
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:24,921
...I'm fine.

558
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,006
So...

559
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,444
- Justin?
- Hey.

560
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:50,280
It's okay. It's just me.

561
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:53,408
You were right.
Right about everything.

562
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:56,453
About Casey, about keeping quiet.

563
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,456
My husband thinks
that I am nuts right now.

564
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:02,208
But I believe you and I wanna help.

565
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:04,085
So, what can I do?

566
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,963
Do you know
how to contact your father?

567
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:12,135
If we can let him know what's happening,
we may be able to protect him.

568
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:13,803
He moves around a lot.

569
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:18,308
He's really paranoid.
He doesn't trust anyone.

570
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:24,022
Last time he left, he made sure
I had a way to contact him.

571
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:27,734
Thank you, Ellie.

572
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,320
And just remember,
you're serving your country.

573
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:49,881
Shaw.

574
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:55,011
You're not bleeding anymore.

575
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:57,138
That's right, Chuck, I'm not.

576
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,516
What does that mean?

577
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:02,310
It means I'm still alive.

578
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,439
Hey, what's wrong?

579
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:12,779
Nothing.

580
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:16,699
Nothing, sorry. Go back to sleep.
