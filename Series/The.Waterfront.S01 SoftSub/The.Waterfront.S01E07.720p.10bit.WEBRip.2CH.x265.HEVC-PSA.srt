every five minutes. I wish I could.

176
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,221
Jesus Christ.

177
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,851
[ominous music playing]

178
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:05,104
[Harlan] They just pulled up.
Reggie, Tim, will you show them in?

179
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,819
Might be a good idea
if I do the talking here.

180
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,237
This is serious shit, son.

181
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,322
I'll do the talking.

182
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:17,158
You have no idea
what we've gotten ourselves into.

183
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,328
[exhales] Okay.

184
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,332
[ominous music rising]

185
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,544
We're alone.

186
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,796
It's just us.

187
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:39,680
Cane? I'm glad you called.

188
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,643
Harlan. Nice to see you.

189
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,772
[ominous music continues]

190
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:56,155
Harlan, remember my father, Jeb?

191
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,993
Last time I was here,
I walked around on my own two feet

192
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:04,830
instead of being pushed around
like a baby in a goddamn stroller.

193
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:07,124
[Emmett] Well, we're here.

194
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,834
We'd like to make a deal.

195
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:15,424
We're willing to offer you
our boats and runners for a year

196
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,426
and push the product at your pace,

197
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,721
uh, in a way in which
we wouldn't be raising any red flags.

198
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:24,266
If we do, by some chance,
come across the law,

199
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,351
we would take the heat.

200
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:29,146
In exchange, we're looking for 12 million.

201
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:35,111
Seven up front,
and, uh, the rest at deal's end,

202
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:38,322
at which point
we could renegotiate the terms.

203
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,866
Sounds like you need fast money.

204
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:46,414
Does this sound like something
you'd be interested in, or no?

205
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,624
Don't overplay your hand, son.

206
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:53,421
Now, last I heard,
you were smuggling with a third party.

207
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:57,341
You aren't double-dipping now, are you?

208
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,344
It's a good deal.

209
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,179
It's a rich deal.

210
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:06,350
A yes or no is all that'd be necessary.

211
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,018
[chuckles]

212
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:11,063
You raised a tough kid, Harlan.

213
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:15,276
But I can't trust it. It's desperate.

214
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,362
You must know all about that, Harlan.

215
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:22,032
All that nastiness
from the last time we tried to do this?

216
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,203
That's the past.

217
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,414
We're talking about right now.

218
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:31,751
And we both know you're interested
or you wouldn't be here.

219
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:32,877
[clears throat]

220
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,839
Well, we'd have to be exclusive.

221
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,924
Nobody else has access to those boats.

222
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,761
Meaning you cut ties
with your current supplier.

223
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,929
[Jeb] Yeah, what-- what's his name again?

224
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,890
-Oh, it's Grady.
-Right.

225
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,267
[inhales]

226
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,311
I'd like to commit to that.

227
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:55,649
I'm not sure Grady will be amenable,
but I'm sure you could handle that issue.

228
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:56,901
[Jeb chuckles]

229
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:00,988
So, we're gonna kill this guy for you,

230
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,283
and then throw in
seven million on top of that?

231
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:06,035
Do I-- Do I have this right?

232
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,707
I gotta ask.

233
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:15,127
Why does this guy have to die?
Why quit him and come with us?

234
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,173
The man has no code.

235
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,425
No sense of honor.

236
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:24,136
Ah. That's what you're missing? Honor?

237
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,932
With you, for better or worse,

238
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,558
I always knew where I stood.

239
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,812
But how do I know you've got honor?

240
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:36,482
How do I trust the son of Beau Buckley?

241
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:42,363
I know as well as anyone
what happens if we cross you.

242
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:51,705
All right.

243
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,041
We'll take care of Grady tonight.

244
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:56,710
The rest we can work out during the week.

245
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:02,341
It's always good
to work with people you respect.

246
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,848
[ominous music continues]

247
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,933
[Harlan breathing heavily]

248
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:21,193
Changing of the guard, eh?

249
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:23,612
Nice work, son.

250
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:42,172
So that old man tortured

251
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:45,134
and killed Grandpa.

252
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,723
[sighs heavily]

253
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,308
Why?

254
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,269
Your grandfather betrayed him.

255
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,439
Jeb is old school.

256
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,400
Whatever else you want to say,

257
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,486
he has an honor code.

258
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,531
Why'd he cross him?

259
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:12,119
Selling drugs is a drug.

260
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,331
You get that money in your pocket,

261
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:18,000
greed in your eyes,

262
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,170
ego in your head.

263
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,799
It's hard to find your way back.

264
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:29,762
[foreboding music playing]

265
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,093
Here. I'll do it.

266
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:14,974
Oh.

267
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,142
Does it hurt?

268
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,019
No.

269
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,188
Not anymore.

270
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:22,272
Good.

271
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,110
Can we talk?

272
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,820
I don't wanna talk.

273
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,949
Fine. Then you can listen.

274
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,371
We've been married for 36 years.

275
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,917
Some good, some bad.
Things get better, things get worse.

276
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,795
Then you go and have two heart attacks.

277
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:47,006
Business goes to shit.

278
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:50,551
You drown yourself
in women and booze more and more.

279
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,803
Someone had to take control.

280
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,805
It doesn't excuse what you did.

281
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,935
I made a decision,
and it was the right one.

282
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,437
You couldn't do it.

283
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,772
But that land isn't yours, is it?

284
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,025
You had no right to touch an acre of it.

285
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,401
Oh, don't give me that crap.

286
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,945
This family is as much mine
as it is yours.

287
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,699
I've earned the Buckley name, which is
more than I can say for you lately.

288
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,787
I was gonna tell you
the minute it was all in place, okay?

289
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,247
You're not getting it!

290
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,540
You lied to me.

291
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:24,001
Like you never lied to me.

292
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:26,628
You want the truth? I fucked him.

293
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,673
The man I brought the deal to?

294
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:30,716
You what?

295
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,927
I slept with another man.

296
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:37,723
You think just because I'm a woman,
I don't need something extra?

297
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:40,851
Something to take my mind
off this bullshit for five minutes?

298
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:44,021
So telling me this
is gonna make everything okay?

299
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,024
You want to hurt me?

300
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:48,692
Well done.

301
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:52,571
I'm hurt.

302
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,948
I didn't do it to hurt you.

303
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:00,704
[sighs]

304
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,043
I have always tried to have your back.

305
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:09,421
I have always
put you and this family first.

306
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,176
Fuck you for not seeing that.

307
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:26,688
[knocking desperately]

308
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:28,857
[knocking continues]

309
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,442
Jesus Christ.

310
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,945
[knocking continues]

311
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:36,907
What is wrong with you?!

312
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,742
Wait. Hey, Rodney, we're not--

313
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,994
-Where is he?
-What are you talking about?

314
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:43,372
I'm not playing games with you, Bree.
Where is he?!

315
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,706
Who, Diller?

316
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,874
I'm serious, Bree!

317
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,627
Why don't you know where he is, Rodney?

318
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,963
I have no idea what you're talking about.

319
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,758
Diller didn't come home last night.

320
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,469
What?

321
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,555
Jesus!

322
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,390
Rodney…

323
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:05,435
Okay, okay, uh,
where was the last time you saw him?

324
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,063
We got into an argument.
I sent him to his room.

325
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:11,150
I went to check on him, and he was gone.

326
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,235
And now is the first time
you're telling me?

327
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:17,656
We were hoping he'd come back on his own.

328
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:19,700
Oh my God.

329
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:21,994
Okay, all right.

330
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,164
Damn it.

331
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:27,749
He heard what happened with the drug test.

332
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,586
He should be mad at me, not you.

333
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,798
He heard me ask Daphne
for a petition to relocate.

334
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,218
You want to…

335
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,220
You want to move?

336
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,931
I got a job offer in Virginia Beach, so…

337
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:45,517
Wow.

338
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:56,028
Georgina and I think a little separation
would be good for all of us.

339
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,781
-Let us know if you find him.

Much better, thanks.

348
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,361
You decided to stay?

349
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:40,781
Yeah, well, most of my things
are still at the Airbnb, it's not a lot.

350
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:43,283
I'll help you with that.
You headed to work?

-Yeah.
-You can ride with me.

352
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,246
Just give me five minutes.

353
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,165
Hey, are you…

354
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:56,338
Are you ever going to tell me the truth
about this family? What's really going on?

355
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,890
This weekend, you take a day off.

356
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:08,934
We'll go out on the boat.

357
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:10,936
Do a little fishing.

358
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:12,980
And talking.

359
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,106
Okay?

360
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:15,565
Okay.

361
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:21,405
I don't know how to fish, though.
I never learned it.

362
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:22,656
I'll show you.

363
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:25,492
It's not law school. It's pretty easy.

364
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:28,829
[Savannah] <i>Grandma took me to the mall,</i>

365
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:30,872
<i>and we saw a movie,</i>
<i>and she bought me a new dress.</i>

366
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,499
Oh, that's amazing, sweetie.

367
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:37,129
-[Savannah] <i>When will I see you?</i>
-Uh, soon, I hope.

368
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:40,716
<i>-Are you at work?</i>
-Yep, just got to work. Where's your mama?

369
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,301
She's still sleeping.

370
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:43,969
Oh, she is, is she?

371
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:46,346
You gonna do anything fun with Nana today?

372
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,309
<i>Daddy, what's wrong?</i>

373
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,394
Oh, nothing, baby. I…

374
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,313
I'm gonna call you back, okay?

375
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,064
I'll call you back.

376
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:59,985
[unsettling music playing]

377
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:03,322
[breathing shakily]

378
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,128
So you don't fish. We got that covered.

379
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:19,755
Do you sail?

380
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:20,964
Like a sailboat?

381
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,174
That's a no.

382
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:23,091
[chuckles]

383
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,093
Any kind of boating experience?

384
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,220
-I can jet ski.
-That doesn't count.

385
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,347
[chuckles]

386
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,975
If you're gonna be a Buckley,
you gotta grow some sea legs.

387
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,852
Do you think that's even possible?

388
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:36,605
For me to be a Buckley?

389
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:39,107
I hope so.

390
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:42,277
This family could use
some more good added.

391
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,447
[tires screeching]

392
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:48,408
-Jesus.
-Hang on.

393
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:51,620
[intense music playing]

394
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,249
-[crash]
-[Raf] Out of the car!

395
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:57,793
-Let's go! Get out!
-What the hell?

396
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,294
[Raf] Now, move! Car!

397
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,339
[Raf] Get out now!
Alright, out of the car!

398
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:03,924
All right, goddamn it!

399
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:07,177
Hey, you want me. Just me.

400
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,845
Harlan, what the fuck is going on?

401
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:11,598
-Both of you!
-He's got nothing to do with this.

402
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:13,100
-Now.
-[gunshot]

403
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,143
-Let's go!
-You don't need him!

404
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,396
-Shut the fuck up!
-Leave him here!

405
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:18,730
In the car!

406
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:19,731
[man 2] In there!

407
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,400
Move, pretty boy!

408
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,568
Go! Go!

409
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:26,196
[intense music continues]

410
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,077
[gasps]

411
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:34,496
Jesus Christ.

412
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:37,207
Who are they?

413
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,126
Emmett Parker's men.

414
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,839
What the hell are you doing
tangled up with the Parkers?

415
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,507
We met with them last night, okay?

416
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,927
We made a deal to-- to do runs
in exchange for cash for the land.

417
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,679
Oh, and your dad agreed to this?

418
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,098
It was my idea.
We're out of options here, Mom.

419
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:55,600
Honey, do you even know
who the Parkers are?

420
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:56,977
I know what happened to Grandpa.

421
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,856
And I also know
that Grandpa had it coming.

422
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,234
Oh my God. Fuck!

423
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,194
Fuck…

424
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,821
Fuck me.

425
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:09,156
Fuck.

426
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:13,910
Why are these men dead?

427
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,788
They offered to take out Grady
as a part of the deal.

428
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,582
I-- I'm guessing it didn't work.

429
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:22,836
-Where's your father now?
-I tried calling him. He's not picking up.

430
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:26,339
-I sent Tim and Reggie out to find him.
-Goddamn it, Harlan!

431
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,550
Grady's not going to kill Dad.
He's too smart for that.

432
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,678
He knows he needs him.
This is all just theatrics.

433
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:34,806
This is him. This is--
This is what he does. It's all for show.

434
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,475
These two men are just for show?

435
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:39,269
-Is that all their lives are?
-That's not what I meant, Mom.

436
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,730
I'm closing down the fish house.

437
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:45,775
Everybody, listen up!
We need to pack everything up.

438
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:49,863
We have a gas leak, and we need
to clear the building out ASAP, all right?

439
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,156
Let's go!

440
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,283
[phone buzzing]

441
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,454
-Y'all find him?
-We found his truck just off Creek Road.

442
00:24:57,537 --> 00:25:00,624
Right outside of town.
The door's open, engine's running.

443
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,251
Crashed into a tree.

444
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,587
<i>What-- What do you mean?</i>
<i>What the hell happened?</i>

445
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,588
I found this.

446
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,552
-Guys, what the fuck is going on?
-[Reggie] <i>Someone forced him off the road.</i>

447
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:13,803
Took a shot at him, Cane.

448
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:16,556
Bring his truck back here.
As soon as you can, okay?

449
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,141
I'm gonna come meet you outside.

450
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:24,064
Diller?

451
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:35,700
[line ringing]

452
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,578
[hip-hop music playing]

453
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:42,541
[exhales]

454
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,129
[knocking]

455
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,924
Come on out. Jig is up.

456
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:59,015
All right, fine. We'll do it your way,
but just so you know,

457
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:01,101
I got nowhere to be, so…

458
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:04,020
[clears throat]

459
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:09,025
Well, hi.

460
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,445
How'd you find me?

461
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:13,905
I'm your mother.

462
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:16,866
So you're going to call Dad now, or…

463
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:20,912
Ugh. Oh, please, let your father squirm.
He deserves it.

464
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:25,584
He told me about the move.

465
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:27,794
I'm not leaving.

466
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,133
[pats on wood]

467
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:34,384
Come here.

468
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:38,930
[exhales]

469
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:43,435
I'm not going to force you to go home,
but I think you should.

470
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:51,943
Truth is, neither of us can really do much
about what happens next.

471
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,571
It's so unfair.

472
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:58,825
I mean… he won't let me say anything.

473
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:02,579
-And it's my life.
-Yeah, he can be a stubborn asshole.

474
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:04,289
-Yeah.
-So can you.

475
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:06,041
-[exhales]
-So can I.

476
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,668
[chuckling]

477
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:13,340
Do you know what
he's the most stubborn about, though?

478
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:15,550
You.

479
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:17,844
Because he loves you.

480
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:25,435
All he's ever trying to do is protect you,
and that is a gift, not a curse.

481
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:28,813
Trust me, I know all about curses.

482
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,944
So why didn't you take the test?

483
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,613
[inhales]

484
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:39,866
[exhales]

485
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,829
Because I knew what it'd say.

486
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,085
And I…

487
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:53,463
I know it would be better
if I could explain, but I can't.

488
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:55,840
And I-- I don't expect you to forgive me,

489
00:27:55,924 --> 00:28:00,053
but I do need you to know
that I love you too.

490
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,723
I want to protect you too.

491
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:06,685
And you…

492
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:13,858
You are the only reason that
I will never stop trying to be better.

493
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:19,280
Whether you're 5 or 500 miles away.

494
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,950
[emotional music playing]

495
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,079
I wish things were different.

496
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:28,623
Me too.

497
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,792
[sniffles]

498
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,337
[chuckles]

499
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:36,756
-Dad's gonna be so pissed.
-Oh, yeah.

500
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,841
[both chuckle]

501
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:40,301
-Do you need a ride?
-No.

502
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:44,305
-He'll just find a way to blame it on you.
-[chuckles dryly]

503
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,934
-Good luck.
-See you later.

504
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:23,136
[tense music playing]

505
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:30,727
[soft thud]

[door opens]

507
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:42,405
[Belle] Oh!

508
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,742
[whispers] Oh. Hi. Hi.

509
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:47,452
-Oh my God.
-It's okay.

510
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:50,413
-Oh my God! Oh my God! Mom!
-It's okay. Hey. Stay clam.

511
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,123
-Bree…
-Those guys are dead. They're dead.

512
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,667
-I need you to stay calm.
-I can't breathe… [wheezing]

513
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:55,919
-This is…
-Okay.

514
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:58,713
[Bree breathing shakily]

515
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,966
[suspenseful music playing]

516
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:14,813
Come on.

517
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,441
[grunts]

518
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,868
You are bumming me out, HB.

519
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:31,371
[chuckling] I thought
you'd at least have the balls

520
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:32,747
to try and kill me yourself.

521
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:37,085
Whatever this is,
it has nothing to do with the kid.

522
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:39,838
Huh.

523
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,882
Would you look at that? It's you again.

524
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,970

00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:05,212
Ugh…

702
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:11,594
-Honey, you need to take a break.
-No. It'll leave a stain if we leave it.

703
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:14,472
Can't have anyone asking questions.

704
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:17,099
-Bree, stop.
-No, it's--

705
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:18,851
You need to breathe.

706
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:19,852
Let's be honest.

707
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:23,355
I haven't been able to breathe
since I was seven years old.

708
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:28,611
I'm sure this has brought up
some really difficult memories for you.

709
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:31,906
Fuck you, Mom. Are you serious right now?
Yes, I am freaking out.

710
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:34,241
I'm allowed to freak out.
Just let me freak out.

711
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:38,037
-I know what happened to you wasn't easy.
-No, you don't.

712
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,207
You have no idea what it was like for me
because I lied for you.

713
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,209
I lied to the police,

714
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:46,462
and then you and Cane and Daddy
got to just live your lives

715
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:48,631
and pretend it never happened
the way it did.

716
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:51,050
The only person
that was left with the truth was me.

717
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:53,802
You think I lied to make our lives easier?

718
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:55,137
Huh?

719
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:56,680
You were a witness.

720
00:41:56,764 --> 00:42:00,392
You could identify the men
that killed your grandfather.

721
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:03,395
If I hadn't made you lie,
they would've killed you too.

722
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:05,523
Well, maybe you should've let them.

723
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:09,318
I killed him.

724
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:12,071
Honey,

725
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:13,531
you were a child.

726
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:15,991
-There was nothing you could've done.
-No.

727
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:18,994
No… Marcus.

728
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:21,997
Agent Sanchez.

729
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,960
-I killed him.
-What?

730
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:29,755
He was gonna go after you and Daddy,
so I-- I got him some drugs.

731
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:31,840
I knew he'd take them…

732
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,469
and he died.

733
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,888
Oh my God. Why didn't you tell me?

734
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,098
Why would I tell you?

735
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:44,019
You sniffed out I'd used in two seconds
and wrote me off even faster.

736
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:46,814
And I guess it was obvious,
'cause Rodney did too,

737
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,732
and now he's gonna take Diller away,

738
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:51,527
and I'm not gonna see my son
for God knows how long,

739
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:54,071
and a part of me thinks I deserve this.

740
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:56,490
I deserve to be punished.

741
00:42:56,574 --> 00:43:01,620
No. No, you don't, angel.
You've been punished enough.

742
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:07,793
From the moment we found you that day,
I failed you.

743
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:11,213
I tried to protect you, but I failed you,
and that's on me.

744
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:12,965
Not you, you understand?

745
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:14,133
Okay.

746
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:17,469
Hey. Come here. Come here.

747
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:20,514
-It's all gonna be all right.
-[Bree sobbing]

748
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,938
[grunting]

749
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,109
[Shawn] All right, slowly.

750
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:33,819
-Slow, slow.
-[Reggie groans]

751
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:37,698
-He needs a hospital.
-We'll get him to a doctor, okay?

752
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:42,202
Hey. Thank you for coming for us.

753
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,079
What was I gonna do, let you die?

754
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:45,205
You could've.

755
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:47,458
Well, next time I know.

756
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:51,295
We gotta call your mother,
your sister, and your wife.

757
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:54,506
We need everybody safe.
Grady's not going quietly.

758
00:43:58,093 --> 00:44:01,221
[intense music playing]

759
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:06,393
[Bree] No, he went home hours ago.

760
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:09,897
I haven't seen him, Rodney. I'm not ly--

761
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:15,736
Diller?

762
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:20,240
[line ringing]

763
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:22,826
[Diller] <i>Text me.</i>
<i>I don't talk on the phone.</i>

764
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:25,037
Diller?

765
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:34,963
[ominous music playing]

766
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:37,841
[screaming]

767
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:41,011
[music intensifies and stops]

768
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:45,933
[closing theme music playing]

769
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:06,013
[music ends]
