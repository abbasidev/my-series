[unsettling music continues]

7
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,397
[man 1] You wanna head back, or what?

8
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:07,233
-[man 2] Not until we're past the barrier.
-[man 1] Okay, good.

[ghostly echo ringing]

14
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,721
Hey, Harlan.

15
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:39,682
Honey, wake up.
Bree didn't come home last night.

16
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,852
When was the last time you saw her?

17
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:46,189
At the fish house,
when we were cleaning up the office.

18
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:49,651
Think it could've been too much for her?
Maybe she needed a drink.

19
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:52,362
No, we talked it all through.
She was fine when she left.

20
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,780
Well, what are you implying?

21
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:56,282
Could Grady have done something with Bree?

22
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,035
[sighs]

23
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:04,290
-Where are you going?
-To get ready. I've got shit to do.

24
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:07,627
Excuse me, our daughter is missing,
and there are two bodies in our ice room.

25
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,796
I hear you. I will deal with it.

26
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:10,713
[sighs]

27
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:14,259
You and Shawn go to the restaurant.
Be around people.

[sighs in relief] Jesus Christ.

37
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:58,928
-What the hell is wrong with you?
-I didn't know you were coming home.

38
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,138
Oh, clearly.

39
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:01,723
Jesus Christ.

00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,018
-[Peyton exhales]
-Where's Savannah?

41
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:07,020
I left her with my parents.

42
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,980
[Cane] Oh, Jesus Christ.

43
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:10,231
Listen to me, baby.

44
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,358
You cannot be here right now.
It's not safe.

45
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,903
[scoffs] What are you talking about?

46
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,446
[panting]

47
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,198
What did you do, Cane?

48
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,786
Okay, we-- we've been smuggling heroin

49
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,664
with this guy who's got a poppy field
about an hour away from here.

50
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:29,918
Well, he-- he had a poppy field.
I kinda, um-- I kinda burned it down.

51
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:30,835
Jesus, Cane.

52
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,713
Bottom line, it is not safe
for you to be here right now.

53
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,840
-That's convenient.
-Listen, I'm not lying to you!

54
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,592
I can't have anything happen to you!

55
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:39,427
Where were you the other night?

56
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,347
[breathing heavily]

57
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,389
I was at work.

58
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,641
Oh, bullshit.

59
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:46,851
I have the Ring app on my phone.

60
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,604
I know every time
you've walked in and out that door.

61
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,397
You haven't slept here
the past two nights.

62
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,900
So let's try this again.
The truth this time.

63
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:57,654
I don't have enough time
to be dealing with this shit.

64
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,530
-To be working through this--
-Damn it, Cane.

65
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:02,367
I can't deal with this now.
You have to trust me on this.

66
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,661
Tell me the truth, Cane.

67
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,121
Okay.

68
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,459
Uh, yeah, I slept with Jenna.

69
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:14,796
Oh my God.

70
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,674
[Cane] I don't know what happened.
I just, uh…

71
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,343
It happened.

72
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:24,305
I don't know what to do now.
I don't know what to say to you.

73
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,224
I-- I don't know, um…

74
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:28,893
I don't know anything.

75
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,105
[voice breaking] Do you love her?

76
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:36,442
I love you, Peyton.

77
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,027
[tense music playing]

78
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:38,945
Okay?

79
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:40,905
Well, I hate you.

80
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:43,741
And I hate her.

81
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:46,369
I warned her.

82
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,413
Peyton, listen to me. This is not on her.

83
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:52,166
-This is on me. So if you have any anger--
-I've got enough to go around.

84
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:56,087
-Peyton, listen to me. This is not on her.
-Don't fucking touch me!

85
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,093
[tense music builds]

86
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:13,229
-You find your sister?
-No.

87
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,607
-I was too busy destroying my marriage.
-Something happen?

88
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,652
I should have left this town
a long time ago, but I didn't.

89
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,156
I just wish I was somewhere
other than here. Anywhere.

90
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,574
Are you done?

91
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,075
Yeah.

92
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:29,287
I left word with Rodney and Diller.
They're not picking up.

93
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:34,917
If Grady actually took Bree, then why?

94
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,628
I mean, why? Why?
If it was a ransom situation,

95
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:40,673
he would have called with demands
and a deal already, right?

96
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,426
He wouldn't actually kill Bree.

97
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,763
We burned up his entire operation.

98
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:53,269
[suspenseful music playing]

00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,731
[phone buzzing]

100
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,777
HB! I was wondering
if I might hear from you.

101
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,445
Grady, you need to listen to me.

102
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,864
No, I don't listen to you.
You listen to me.

103
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:08,576
We're going to make an even swap, okay?
You, for your daughter.

104
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,245
<i>Come alone, she lives.</i>

105
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,790
<i>Break that one simple rule,</i>

106
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,333
and she dies.

107
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:18,586
-Where are ya?
-I'll text you the rest of the details.

108
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:19,962
[call disconnects]

109
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,715
What happened? Wha-- what did he say?

110
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:23,966
[phone buzzing]

111
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,345
Coordinates.

112
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:30,765
He wants to meet
in the middle of the goddamn ocean.

113
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:31,891
Okay.

114
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:36,729
-We need a plan now.
-I got a plan. Get our daughter back.

115
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,272
That's not a plan, Harlan.

116
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:39,982
-I'm coming with you.
-[Harlan scoffs]

117
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:43,277
-You go by yourself, he's gonna kill you.
-If you come, he'll kill us both.

118
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:45,279
Harlan, they're right.

119
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,074
You won't come back,
and Bree won't either.

120
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:51,285
You're all acting like
there's some other option. There isn't.

121
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,245
What if there is?

122
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,334
[suspenseful music playing]

[exhales]

126
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,159
Peyton, what are you doing here?

127
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,663
-I told you I would come for you.
-I just came from the hospital.

128
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,000
My dad passed last night.

[sobbing]

131
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:48,885
You're gonna be okay.

132
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,179
[continues sobbing]

133
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,064
-[Emmett] Thank you for calling me, Belle.
-Thank you.

134
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:05,067
God, you Buckleys
are always in the thick of it, you know.

135
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,777
Right in the eye of the storm.

136
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,738
That's the wrong analogy.

137
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,823
The eye of the storm
is where it's the calmest.

138
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,617
That's not where we're at, is it?

139
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,496
Am I wrong to be in business
with the Buckleys again? I mean, does…

140
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,915
Does Harlan still carry a grudge?

141
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,793
What do you think? You killed his father.

142
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,838
Is that something you could ever forget?

143
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:27,715
[inhales] Well…

144
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:35,264
You sure made a… success of this here.

145
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,851
-Of course, you had my family's money.
-Yes, we did.

146
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:43,189
Gosh, we have--
we have so much history, Belle.

147
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:46,275
You know, I remember you
when you were in your teenage years.

148
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,819
-So, so beautiful.
-Mm.

149
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,405
And I must admit, I'm--

150
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:54,367
I mean, I'm a little surprised
you stayed married to Harlan.

151
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,160
You know, he's a-- he's a hard man.

152
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,788
-He sure is.
-Yeah.

153
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,122
How's that going?

154
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,876
What do you think?
We have our troubles just like everybody.

155
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,212
Yeah, I suspected as much.

156
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,297
Given the debt y'all are facing.

157
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,757
[lock engages forcefully]

[tense music creeping in]

159
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,887
See, I know all about
your financial situation.

160
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,556
That busted-up land deal.

161
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,391
Wes Benson, he's a piece of work.

162
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,768
Took you for a ride.

163
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,438
Although, for what it's worth,
you were right to develop the property.

164
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,107
See?

165
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,359
I'm on your side, Belle.

166
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:34,073
I'm on your side, and I… I hope you know
that Harlan's not what he used to be.

167
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:36,742
Maybe you should be in charge.

168
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,453
If you ever needed a favor,
I could be a friend to you.

Diller?

175
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,289
-What are you doing here?
-I saw them take you.

176

-How are you here?
-I heard you yelling in the boatyard.

179
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:33,633
And I came to watch.
And I saw those guys grab you.

00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,010
-Did anyone see you?
-No, I climbed the bow's tie.

181
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:38,554
-I hid in the line locker.
-How long have we been out here?

182
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,014
Maybe two hours.

183
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,349
How many men did you see?

184
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:44,393
There's four guys.
One's the captain, plus Grady.

-You have to hide.

-I'm right here. Right here.

I told you everything would be okay.

-I can get a doctor.

544
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:13,092
No, no, I'm fine.
It's just a little bit of pain.

I only get like two Tylenol
