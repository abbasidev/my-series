[dispatch chatter over police radio]

12
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,252
Call me when you find out.

13
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:46,921
[Cane] I can't believe this.
I cannot fucking believe this!

14
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:51,342
Tim and Reggie are going to ask around
to see if they find the guys who did this.

15
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:54,679
-How did this happen?
-This was a warning from our friend Owen.

16
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:57,807
The sheriff? Sheriff--
Of course it was the fucking sheriff!

17
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,226
Keep it down. I'll take care of it.

18
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,103
How are you gonna take care of it?

19
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,606
[Belle] Hey, we're here. Is she okay?

20
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:06,441
-[Cane] Freaked out.
-Where's Savannah?

21
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:08,902
She's upstairs. I sent the sitter home.

22
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,279
-Hey.
-Hey.

23
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:13,364
[Belle] Hey, how you doin'?

24
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,242
Okay, stay with her.
I'll check on Savannah.

25
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:18,036
I-- I smell.

26
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,871
It's okay. It's okay.

27
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,207
-Hey, Drew.
-Yes, sir.

28
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,792
Has the sheriff been notified?

29
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,877
I called him. He's aware of the situation.

30
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,963
You called him?
Is he at home with his thumb up his ass?

31
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:31,257
-You're not helping.
-Don't worry, Cane.

32
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:35,136
-We're gonna find who did this.
-Can we finish this up, please?

33
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:38,973
Yes, ma'am. Just a couple more questions.

34
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,768
-Are you okay?
-No.

35
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:45,730

[music softens]

43
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,888
How can I help you, Harlan?

44
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,182
Speak to you in private?

45
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:24,853
[tense music resumes]

46
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,858
[Clyde] Hey, go on. Take a seat.

47
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,737
You want to tell me
what the hell that was?

48
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:38,032
Some meth heads out to score drug money.
My guys are on it.

49
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,952
But I'd say
your daughter-in-law got lucky.

50
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:43,496
My family is off-limits.

51
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,082
It's a shame what happened.

52
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,377
The world gets more dangerous every day.

53
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,004
It helps to have friends.

54
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,298
I told you.

55
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,550
No more runs.

56
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,678
Not until I meet Grady.

57
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:02,307
Well…

58
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,268
[somber music playing]

59
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:10,023
Think that through, Harlan,
and my guess is you'll change your mind.

60
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:15,904
[inhales sharply]

61
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,822
[exhales]

62
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,878
[gritty music playing]

63
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:47,769
[Savannah] Daddy, if we don't go now,
I'm gonna be late.

64
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,940
Okay, go get your stuff.
I need to, uh, say goodbye to your mom.

65
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,359
-Come on, we leave in one minute.
-[Cane] Yeah.

66
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:57,695
Baby?

67
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:01,324
Hey, it's okay. I'll take her.

68
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:02,659
No, I got it.

69
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,537
Jesus, my hair still smells like an Exxon.

70
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,959
Don't you want to stay home? Take it easy?

71
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,168
[Peyton] No, I'm good.

72
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:18,049
Are you sure? I think it might be
a good idea if you just stayed home.

73
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,219
-I said I'm good.
-Jesus Christ, Peyton.

74
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:22,679
Cool gun!

75
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,973
No, that's not cool, okay?
That is not cool.

76
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:27,642
You do not touch that, ever.
You understand me?

77
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:29,560
Not those shoes, the blue ones.

78
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,146
What are you doing?

79
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,524
At least I'm not trying
to hide everything from her.

80
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,151
What's that supposed to mean?

81
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,696
It means that whatever
those men wanted last night

82
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,823
had nothing to do with me,

83
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,449
which leaves you.

84
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:46,369
-You can start talking any time.
-[sighs in exasperation]

85
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:52,583
Baby, I honestly don't know who did this.
Okay? You gotta believe me.

86
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,502
[Savannah] Okay, I'm ready.

87
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:56,087
[Cane sighs]

88
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:01,134
I will drive us, okay?
We can all go together as a family.

89
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:02,927
-You ready?
-I don't think so.

90
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,013
Let's go, hon!

91
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,432
Before I hurt your daddy.

92
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,606
[tense music plays]

[tense music continues]

96
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:26,451
Hey, can you, uh, follow her, please?
It's okay if she sees you.

97
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:28,703
Just-- just keep an eye on her for me.

98
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,705
[Tim] <i>Yes, sir.</i>

99
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:31,831
Okay, thank you.

100
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,666
[knocking on door]

101
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:43,009
-[Marcus] Sorry, I was in the shower.
-Uh, no, this… This works for me.

102
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:44,635
[chuckling]

103
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,017
[sighs] I got your message.
What happened last night?

104
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,936
Cane's wife was attacked.

105
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:58,649
-Really?
-Yeah, she's okay, but it's suspicious.

106
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,986
-Is it drug-related?
-Maybe. It's unclear. I'll let you know.

107
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,238
-Did anything I give you help?
-Um, yeah.

108
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,574
I went through the manifest
for the trawler.

109
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:11,120
And the Morning Breeze
recorded four trips…

110
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,081
in the past month.

111
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,041
You cross-reference these
with the fishery's log?

112
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,085
No catch of any kind was unloaded.

113
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,545
The boat was gone
ten to 14 hours each time,

114
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,090
returning to port with
two instances of engine trouble,

115
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:25,176
and two trips were written off
to inclement weather.

116
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:28,554
That's completely consistent
with the Miss Glory manifest.

117
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,725
So Cane had two boats actively smuggling.

118
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:34,685
[scoffs]

119
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:37,021
[Marcus] Interesting.

120
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:43,069
What do you know about these guys that
run the boat? Tim Donnelly, Reggie Miller?

121
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:44,278
Both ex-cons.

122
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,073
Cane hired them six months ago.

123
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:52,620
-Do we know if the AIS was turned off?
-How would I know that?

124
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,789
[tense music playing]

125
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:57,291
-Can you get me on the Morning Breeze?
-[chuckles]

126
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,628
If the AIS was manually disconnected,
that's illegal.

127
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,089
Is it enough?

128
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:05,800
Enough for my captain
to issue a shadow surveillance

129
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:07,051
to follow the next run.

130
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,553
Best way to make a case stick,

131
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:11,264
I gotta catch them in the act
with drugs in their hands.

132
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,352
I can get you on the boat.

133
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,229
This could work.

134
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,858
Wanna have sex?

135
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,109
[laughs heartily]

136
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,944
-I love your nuance.
-Come here.

137
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:27,905
-[chuckling] You are such an addict.
-Mm-hmm.

138
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,908
I'm starting to like sober sex.

139
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,160
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

140
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,913
Maybe it's just sex with you.

141
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:45,590
[atmospheric music playing]

142
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,509
-[Shawn] Ms. Buckley?
-Hey.

143
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,261
You got a second?

144
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:51,762
Of course.

145
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:54,265
Why don't you take a seat?

146
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,275
Uh, I'm sorry I ran out on you last night.
There was an emergency.

147
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,235
-Is--
-Everything's fine.

148
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,739
And about what we talked about…

149
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,117
It's just a lot to process.

150
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:14,619
I know.

151
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,246
I'm sorry for the way that I handled it.

152
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:21,417
-If you want me to take a DNA test, I can.
-No, no, Shawn. I believe you.

153
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:26,714
I also believe in memories,
and I keep lots of them.

154
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,510
Surprise.

155
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:34,430
[pensive music playing]

156
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:38,392
Your mama.

157
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:39,852
Bebe.

158
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,731
She worked here years ago
when we were just a tiny place.

159
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,817
She was sweet

160
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,361
and so funny.

161
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,446
My God, we laughed.

162
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,699
I'm sorry to hear she passed.

163
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,284
She was amazing.

164
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,371
The absolute best.

165
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,083
She never talked about my dad.

166
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,545
I never pushed.
I figured it was a bad subject for her.

167
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,131
But then she got sick and…

168
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,842
You said it was cancer?

169
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,261
[Shawn] Leukemia.

170
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:16,222
Diagnosed right as
I was finishing law school.

171
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,935
I was with her through treatment.

172
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:27,149
Then, toward the end…
she told me one day, out of the blue,

173
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,486
"Your father's name is Harlan Buckley."

174
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,698
"He's a fisherman
from Havenport, North Carolina."

175
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:37,493
-You must've been curious.
-She told me he was "complicated."

176
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,787
-That's the word she used.

What did your captain say?

531

Said it's not enough
to warrant a shadow operation.
