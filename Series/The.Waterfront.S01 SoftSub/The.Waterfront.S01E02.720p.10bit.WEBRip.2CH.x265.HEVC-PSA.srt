00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:46,984
to bring us up to date.

169
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,529
Won't save us,
but we won't lose everything.

170
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:53,491
Yeah, and with consistent runs,
we should be good in a few months.

171
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,409
Here's the thing.

172
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,704
There's no way
Porter is the top dog in this.

173
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,122
He's answering to someone.

174
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,791
[Belle] Hmm.

175
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:02,708
Like a supplier.

176
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:08,506
If we can find his supplier
and establish our own supply line,

177
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,591
then we don't even need Porter.

178
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:14,345
-That's how we make this really work.
-Dad… I hear you.

179
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:15,930
It just sounds a bit intense.

180
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:18,266
[Belle] This is a temporary situation.

181
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:21,477
We're not gonna make a business out of it.
Those days are over.

182
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,437
Yes, but with no Porter,

183
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,857
we negotiate a higher fee
and get out faster.

184
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,067
Or…

185
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,195
we could, and hear me out here,

186
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,240
partner with a developer
and build out the beachfront.

187
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:37,785
It would solve everything.
Not right away, but eventually.

188
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:40,746
-Why would you bring that up?
-Because it's a real option.

189
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,958
Hell, we're gonna lose it anyway
if we can't pay the bank back.

190
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,460
We're not touching that land.
You know that.

191
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:49,255
-Not now, not ever.
-I know how much it means to you.

192
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,007
God damn it. No.

193
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,051
-It's not a conversation.
-Granddaddy!

194
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,094
Hey.

195
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,138
Hello, darling.

196
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,974
-How'd it go today?
-It's all but done.

197
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:03,978
-Waiting on the lawyers.
-You'll have to tell him at some point.

198
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:06,397
Did you not hear me? I tried.

199
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,857
Yeah, yeah.

200
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,151
He's gonna explode when he finds out.

201
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:14,447
[exhaling] Oh, shit.
It's all so fucked up, man.

202
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:16,949
[huffs] I mean, you see him, right?

203
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,744
-I mean, he's acting w-weird, right?
-[snorts]

204
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:21,162

205
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,040
Yeah.

206
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:26,876
Crime always did agree with him.

207
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,753
-[Peyton] Hi, baby.
-Hi.

208
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:32,632
Hi, Peyton. How are you?

209
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,843
-I'm fine, Belle. How you doing?
-Great, thank you.

210
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,261
Good.

211
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:40,181

Hi, my name is Marcus.
I'm a heroin addict.

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,421
[recites] Hi, Marcus.

262
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:21,133
Let's see,
I spent another day in… bumfuck nowhere,

263
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:24,094
investigating a bumshit case
that's probably gonna get me fired

264
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,429
and ruin my career.

265
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,309
But I, uh, fucked a motel dresser
to death, and that was fun.

-There's nothing here, Bree.

Boat was clean,
no trace of drugs, the men drowned.

I witnessed it with my own two eyes.

269
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:43,906
I saw Cane with Troy and Curtis and Hoyt,
and they were talking about a drug run.

270
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:47,117
-Did you talk to Hoyt?
-I can't find Hoyt. No one can.

Jesus Christ.

272
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,664
You might be right about your brother,
but to make a drug bust, I need drugs.

273
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,165
And there's nothing.

274
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,334
It's my first case out of rehab.
I'm on probation.

275
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,586
-They could fucking bench me.
-Follow Cane.

276
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,381
-He'll lead you to Hoyt.
-What about your mom and dad?

277
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:03,300
-No…
-Would they want to help me? Hear me out.

278
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:06,303
If they knew he used the fish house
for drugs, wouldn't they want to know?

279
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,639
-No. You told me, you promised me…
-Bree.

280
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:11,851
…you'd leave them out of this.
They have nothing to do with it.

281
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,145
This started when my brother
took over the business.

282
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:19,275
That's when Hoyt started showing up.
Cane is the one you want.

283
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,862
What's your deal with Cane?

284
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:27,074
Why do you want to expose him?
Why do you hate him so much?

285
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:29,952
I have my reasons.

286
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:34,874

Well, I'm sorry I brought you here.

290
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:43,591

Everything happens for a reason.

292
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,139
You know…

293
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:54,226
when I was undercover and shooting up,

294
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,229
phew, I knew I was in trouble.

295
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,317
-You know I OD'd, right?
-Mm-mm.

296
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,902
I was dead for over a minute.

297
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,405
I came back,
and that's what put me in rehab.

298
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,783
-I think that was to meet you.
-[softly] Yeah…

-[Marcus] I don't want to leave.

301
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,125
-Not when it's this good.
-[playfully] Mm-hmm!

302
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,753

303
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,713

[coughs softly]

305
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:26,383
Trust me. I have been sober a few times.

306
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:29,845
It's transference. [giggles]

307
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:33,432
It's a distraction.
Anything to keep your mind off using.

308
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:35,976
-Oh, yeah? Is that what you think?
-That's what I know.

309
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,686
Now, don't get me wrong.

310
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,940
You're cute
and I'm into you and all, but… [inhales]

311
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,943

up my ass right now if I had one.

315
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:02,336
Hey, did Cane tell you
Jenna's back in town?

316
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,713
-"Jenna" Jenna?
-Mm-hmm.

317
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:05,965
No, I didn't know.

318
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:09,843
I can imagine Peyton's
popped a few blood vessels over it.

319
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:16,892
[Harlan] What is it?

320
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,646
You got me paranoid
about the new bartender.

321
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:25,109
Why?

322
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:30,197
Could he be a DEA informant
that Porter told you about?

323
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,157
He's not a very good bartender.

324
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:38,706
I think it's time we give Bree
a little more responsibility.

325
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:43,335
-She wants back in the office.
-Stop. Do not go soft on her.

326
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:46,630
I want one full year of sobriety
before we ease the reins.

327
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:49,258
If we give in now,
she'll get right back to it.

328
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,929
Do not let her manipulate you.
It's for her own good, okay?

329
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,811
We're confirmed for dinner tomorrow
with Jenna and Scott.

330
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,188
Oh!

331
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,606
That's happening.

332
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,316
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay. Um…

333
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,401
Where are we going?

334
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,862

your mom's hush puppies.

We can cancel if you want to.

339
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,663
Um…

340
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,207
Cancel or reschedule?

341
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,127
-What do you want?
-[chuckles]

342
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:27,713
It's your call.

343
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,674
Mm.

344
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,971
How are the drinks?
Can I get you anything?

345
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,391
-I'm good.
-I'll have a Zombie, please.

346
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:44,855
A Zombie? Yep. Okay. Coming up.

347

He doesn't even know what a Zombie is.

349

[Harlan] A Zombie.

350
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,701
Good God, you're paranoid.

351
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,036
Well, you started it.

352
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:03,040
This is our life now,
always looking over our shoulder.

353
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,176
I'm sorry.

354
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:18,180
I've been waiting
for the right time to say it.

355
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,016
Not sure this is it.

356
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,643
Sorry for what?

357
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:25,395
Everything.

[inhales deeply]

361
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:37,116
For all the drinking…
the carousing, the women.

362
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:39,284
For disappointing you.

363
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:43,622
Honey, I stopped having expectations
a long time ago.

364
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:49,753
I'm sorry.

365
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,798
You're so good at sorry.

366
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:56,468

-Where's Porter?
-I think you mean Owen.

371
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:35,299
-Is Owen coming?
-[Stevie] He sent me.

372
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:37,551
We need to get this in the hold, fast.

373
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:41,013
Why does Owen get to have a Stevie,
but we can't have a Tim and Reggie?

374
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:44,641
There's two more behind this one.
Let's go, before the sun comes up.

375
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,144
Okay.

Aren't we meeting them here in the sound?

383
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,169
The ocean's choppy today.
Here, take the wheel.

384
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:13,981
This one's yours.

385
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:15,816
What? No.

-Relax.

The other guys will have guns too.

Why give me a gun without any bullets?

389
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:26,451

they can't shoot you with it.

What do I do with it?
Put it here like you're doing?

-Never show fear. No sudden movements.

There's a lot of water in this world.
Why Havenport?

Are those radars?

00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:36,433
New models.
The sonar range is double the old models.

-It's only like two shifts.

to just weighing in pounds and ounces?

I could steal from you guys.

00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,764
-[man] Right.
-Makes sense.

511
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:11,351
So I've been meaning to ask,
why are you deciding to build now?

512
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:13,436
People have been chasing
your waterfront for years.

513
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,981
It's a very sentimental piece of property
my husband inherited.

514
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,192
His father bought it for his mother,

515
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:23,738
and it was her wish for it to remain
a little piece of Havenport. Untouched.

516
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:28,201
A lasting symbol
of community, family, legacy.

517
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:29,828
So why the change of heart?

518
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:31,496
I'm a realist.

519
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,624
-And I believe in change.
-Mm.

520
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:37,001
-We're struggling. Everybody's struggling.
-Yeah.

521
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:39,045
The fishing industry's near extinct.

522
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:41,589
Restaurant's seasonal.
We live and die on tourism.

523
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,633
It'd be irresponsible
if we didn't develop it.

524
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:47,053
-True.
-We provide jobs for a lot of people.

525
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:49,472
-Yeah.
-And there's a responsibility in that.

526
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:53,685
-You're very protective over it.
-Well, I grew up here.

527
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:55,144
Not on the water.

528
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:57,063
More inland, less money.

529
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:58,565
Me too.

530
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:00,900
I grew up dirt poor.

531
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:02,485
I know it well.

532
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:04,988
So you know
what a driving force it can be?

533
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:06,656
I hate being broke.

534
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:10,076
It's paralyzing. Soul-killing.

535
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:11,870
Can be.

536
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:16,207
Okay, you're very good with the oysters.

537
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,792
I'm in the seafood business.

538
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,878
-Well, it's very sexy.
-There it is.

539
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:24,966
-I thought you were flirting with me.
-I was trying not to. It's hard.

540
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,844
-I'm sorry. I was trying. I'm--
-Okay, okay.

541
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:31,222
I guess I'm just attracted
to talent and visionaries.

542
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,181
Uh-huh.

543
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:34,017
That's a really good line.

544
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,519
-It-- It sounds like a line.
-Sounds like a line.

545
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:38,980
-Fully.
-I'm okay with it 'cause it's the truth.

546
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,275
We're business partners.

547
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,652
It would be very bad if we…

548
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,531
-And I'm married.
-Yeah.

549
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:50,700
-Right.
-So am I.

550
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:53,453
-Doesn't seem to stop my wife.
-I'm sorry.

551
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:54,579
It's okay.

552
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:56,706
I'm dealing with it.

553
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,584
I love my wife, but…

554
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:06,132
I finally came to the realization that
you can't get everything from one person.

555
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:13,848
[indistinct chatter]

556
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:23,900
[clears throat]

557
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,527
Hello. Where's Peyton?

558
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:29,781
Uh, she's gonna meet us here.
I was just over at the fish house.

559
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:30,782
[sniffs]

560
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:33,660
-But you smell so clean.
-Yeah, where I showered and changed.

561
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:34,577
Mm.

562
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,287
[exhales] So what are you doing?

563
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:40,333
Just hanging out at the bar,
drinking by yourself?

564
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:42,877
Your bartender Shawn
has been keeping me company.

565
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,296
He's new in town.
I'm giving him the skinny.

566
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:48,383
-Evening, Mr. Buckley.
-Can I do a bourbon with ice, please?

567
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:51,427
Actually, you know what?
Make it a double in a tall glass.

568
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:52,345
Tall glass.

569
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:53,304
Yes, sir.

570
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:57,642
I've had an insane day, okay?
I think the bourbon's gonna help.

571
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:58,559
Mm-hmm.

572
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:05,191
So, where's your amazing
superman of a husband?

573
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:07,151
Running late.

574
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,236
Yeah?

575
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,988
He works too much. It's his flaw.

576
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:13,032
Yeah, 'cause making a lot of money
is always a detriment.

577
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,242
Mm.

578
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,411
-[inhales]
-[Cane] Mm.

579
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:18,579
[exhales uncomfortably]

580
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,958
-I'm a little nervous.
-Why's that?

581
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:26,379
My husband
and my high school boyfriend meeting?

582
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:29,340
-Aren't you nervous?
-[scoffs] No.

583
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:33,052
Okay, well, I'm nervous.

584
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:35,596
Yeah, okay.

585
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,725
-Yeah, I might be a little bit nervous.
-Mm.

586
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:40,893
[huffs]

587
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:41,811
Yeah.

588
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:45,231
I took a gummy.

589
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:48,276
You want one?

590
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:52,196
-Fuck, yeah.
-Okay. Oh, and let's do shots.

591
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,990
-[slams counter]
-Scratch the bourbon.

592
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:56,576
We're doing tequila shots, okay?
Line them up.

593
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:57,910
-A blanco.
-[gasps]

594
00:33:57,994 --> 00:33:59,454
-Yeah.
-Always.

595
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:00,371
-Always.
-[giggles]

596
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:01,998
Oh, man.

597
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:11,632
Okay.

598
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,305
-To…
-Yeah.

599
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:18,848
-Yeah.
-[snorts]

600
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:20,016
-Yeah.
-It's okay.

601
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:21,809
Mm.

602
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,103
-[Cane] That's good.
-[Jenna] Mm!

603
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,521
[Cane] Mm.

604
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,523
I'm so glad we're finally doing this.

605
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,233
Scott, it's lovely to meet you.

606
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,527
I'm happy to finally get this way.

607
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:34,989
-Mmm, wow.
-[chuckling] Somebody's hungry.

608
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:38,284
Oh, you have to try these.
I missed these hush puppies so much.

609
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,036
His mom has a secret recipe.

610
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,287
[chuckling]

611
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,040
-Mm.
-Uh-huh.

612
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:46,000
-[Jenna chuckles]
-Mm!

613
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,335
They're certainly fried.

614
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:48,377
[Jenna giggles]

615
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:51,255
Me and Cane used to come here
every day after school,

616
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,257
and we'd have chowder
and eat hush puppies,

617
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,343
and then we'd take the sailboat out.

618
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,178
Do you still have the little Sunfish?

619
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,805
-No. Gave it away years ago.
-No?

620
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:01,641
-Mm.
-Peyton, how do ya fit in this love story?

621
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:03,309
-No love story.
-It was a long time ago.

622
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:07,897
I meant growing up here,
when you were all in school together.

623
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,483
Well, I was a freshman
when they were both seniors,

624
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:14,612
so we didn't run in the same circles,
but they were the "it" couple.

625
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:16,823
-Pretty and popular.
-I…

626
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,491
No one is prettier than you.

627
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:21,661
Peyton was a looker in school,
and you still are, so…

628
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:22,870
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

629
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,331
She is and will be forever.

630
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:30,169
You know, Peyton was, uh,
Miss Teen Carolina.

631
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:35,091
No, I was not. I was top ten.

632
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:37,802
Nine, to be exact,
and let's just leave it there.

633
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:42,515
Question. I'm driving up here,
and I see the name Buckley everywhere.

634
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,226
Does your family own the entire town?

635
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,645
-No.
-Just the harbor and the restaurant.

636
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:50,148
The Buckleys have always been
a prominent family here.

637
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:53,609
Jenna tells me
you were the high school football star?

638
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:56,571
You should try the grouper.
It's delicious.

639
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,364
[tapping on table]

640
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:01,284
-[hits silverware]
-Yes, I was, Scott.

641
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:05,204
I was a football star. I was very good.

642
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:10,626
And that you were, uh…
You were gonna go pro, and you never did.

643
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,632
-What happened?
-No, it was a dream.

644
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,968
-It was a kid's dream.
-[Scott] Mm.

645
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:20,469
And then I grew up.

646
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:26,100
Who needs a pro football career
when you can stay in this tiny little town

647
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,227
and shovel fish?

648
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:30,730
That's… That's not exactly what happened.

649
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:32,607
And he doesn't exactly shovel fish.

650
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:34,525
Close enough.

651
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:39,947
I need another drink.
You guys need another drink?

652
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:46,037
And I apologize in advance
if I offend you.

653
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,371
-Okay.
-But…

654
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:50,416
do you want to come back
to my hotel? [chuckles]

655
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:54,420
Why don't we just
keep this about the work?

656
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:57,506
Do you know
how to compartmentalize, Belle?

657
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,300
Yes. Story of my life.

658
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:00,468
Well, me too.

659
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,136
And I'm very good at it.

660
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:06,057
My career, my marriage…
You seem curious. You a little curious?

661
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,351
[giggling]

662
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:10,144
Nope, I'm afraid not.

663
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,229
No strings.

664
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:14,732
No stress. Like… just a beautiful memory.

665
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:20,613
I can't tell you how entertaining
this has been, but I'm gonna say no.

666
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:23,658
Let's keep us about the work.

667
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,618
Understood.

668
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:27,245
I won't bring it up again.

669
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,708
You're a delight, Belle,
and I will call you soon.

670
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,210
-Good night.
-Good night.

671
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:38,506
[blows raspberry]

672
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:45,137
[pulsing bass line music playing]

673
00:37:58,192 --> 00:37:59,193
Hey.

674
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,655
[music builds]

675
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,419
[exhales]

676
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:18,921
You're right, I was curious.

677
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:23,801
Good night.

678
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:27,638
[music fades]

679
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,140
[exhales]

680
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:30,766
[Jenna] No, it's…

681
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,602
So, what was it that broke you two up?

682
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,771
-Oh.
-Uh…

683
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:37,273
Life happened, Scott.

684
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:41,193
Life happened, uh, and it ended.

685
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:44,113
The first love is never last love, is it?

686
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:46,449
-I like that song.
-I don't think it's a song.

687
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:48,617
I think it's the lyrics
to, like, every song.

688
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:49,785
-You think…
-[giggles]

689
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:52,371
Excuse me, I'm gonna be right back.

690
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:55,124
You know, we should think
about going. The sitter?

691
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,834
[Cane] Right.

692
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,003
Oh…

693
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:04,759
-[Scott] I'll get the bill.
-No, no, no, no, it's on the house.

694
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,261
It's, uh… There's no bill.

695
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,555
It's the perks of a broken dream,
you know?

696
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:14,352
Well, then, I guess I'll go take a piss
and let you two be you two.

697
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:20,441
[sputters]

698
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,903
-What was in that edible?
-Oh, Jesus.

699
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:25,446
God, I'm so stoned.

700
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:29,575
-I can't even keep my head straight.
-Did they know? Or did we do okay?

701
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:31,452
No, they know. Yeah.

702
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:34,205
-Peyton was shooting death rays at me.
-No.

703
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:38,209
-And now she-- she hates me. I'm awful.
-No, you're paranoid. She doesn't care.

704
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:39,877
She-- She… She's fine.

705
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,755
-No, the gummies were a bad idea.
-[laughs]

706
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:46,258
No, I-- I just thought it would help with…

707
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:47,176
[inhales]

708
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:48,928
Help at what?

709
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:52,973
I don't-- I don't think we should do
dinners anymore. [clears throat]

710
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:54,600
And why's that?

711
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:56,477
Cane, just don't.

712
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:01,565
Let-- let's just not talk right now.
Can we do that?

713
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,278
[smacks lips]

714
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:10,157
I will say,
I thought the gummies were a great idea.

715
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,242
[chuckles nervously]

716
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:14,203
[sighs]

717
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,915
[muffled rock music playing]

718
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,545
Nice Jet Skis.

719
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:26,424
For my boys and their kids.

720
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:30,177
I was hoping it'd get them down
to see me more, but nope.

721
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:32,430
Nice car.

722
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:34,181
I like my toys.

723
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,102
You shorted the shipment.

724
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:39,687
No, I didn't.

725
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:44,358
That turd Hoyt
dipped into it prior to his, um…

726
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:46,652
[laughs maliciously]

727
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,613
[chuckling] And then I just thought,

728
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:53,534
well… let's see how well
you and your son perform under duress.

729
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,536
We could've been killed.

730
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:58,747
Yeah, there's always that chance.

731
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:02,501
No, I figured, you know,
someone would call me first,

732
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:06,213
but, you know, when that didn't happen,
yeah, I was a little worried.

733
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,509
[tools crash onto floor]

734
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:15,764
-[Harlan] Come on, get up.
-[Clyde puffs]

735
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:18,726
[panting]

736
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:25,232
[sniffles] You remember
the night your daddy got shot up?

737
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:28,277
What were you? 29? 30?

738
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,696
I was just a deputy then.

739
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:31,864
[panting]

740
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:34,700
It was… It was a bad night.

741
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:38,621
All they did to him, the blood everywhere.

742
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:40,956
[huffs] Jesus, it was awful.

743
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,792
I felt so sorry for you,

744
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:47,505
finding your daddy dead like that.

745
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:50,216
Little Bree all covered in blood.

746
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:57,515
And then, like a week later,
I found you in-- in-- in Turner's,

747
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:03,646
sitting at the bar, drinking all alone.
Do you remember any of this?

748
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:05,564
I remember.

749
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:07,733
[Clyde grunts]

750
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:12,154
I was… downright sad for you.

751
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:16,909
And I ordered you a beer,
but-- but you wouldn't let me pay for it.

752
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:18,953
You refused.

753
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:22,831
I said, "No, I want to buy you a beer,"
but you wouldn't have it.

754
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,208
You had to pay.

755
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:26,377
You insisted.

756
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:31,840
You said, "A cop don't make much.
Save your money. I got it."

757
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,635
I was grateful to you.

758
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:36,637
I wanted to pay.

759
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,557
Yeah, that's the way it is
with you Buckleys.

760
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:43,561
You pay, you control…

761
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:45,813
You're always in charge.

762
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:49,733
When a friend wants to buy you a beer,
you let him.

763
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,528
Okay, Clyde.

764
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:54,989
You can buy the beer.

765
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,283
You can buy all the beer.

766
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:59,660
Oh God, I fucking hated you.

767
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:01,203
[tense music playing]

768
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:03,622
Everybody loved you,
so I had to love you too,

769
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:05,040
but I despised you.

770
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,127
Well, not anymore. [chuckles]

771
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:09,378
Now I enjoy you.

772
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:12,840
I mean,
watching you and your family struggle…

773
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:13,757
[exhales]

774
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,426
…hell, it makes me happy.

775
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:16,343
[chuckles]

776
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:19,597
You worked really hard for that badge.

777
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:21,724
And the power.

778
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:25,269
And now… I'm in charge.

779
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:27,104
I thought that was Grady.

780
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:30,858
Yeah, who's Grady?

781
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:32,484
Your supplier.

782
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:37,406
Who told you that?

783
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:41,118
-Tell him I want to meet him.
-Why?

784
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:43,829
So you can go around me? Cut me out?

785
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,290
I wouldn't advise it.

786
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:50,085
No more runs until I meet Grady.

787
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:54,173
[tense music continues]

788
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,934
[thunder rumbles]

789
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:07,728
[Cane] Sorry, I'm a little drunk.

790
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,146
A little?

791
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:14,610
And I may or may not
have had a tiny little gummy.

792
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:17,571
And where'd you get the gummy?

793
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:19,907
-From Jenna.
-[scoffs]

794
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:23,494
What?

795
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:26,622
I've had the worst day. You have no idea.

796
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:29,833
Can I… Can I please just get
a pass on this one? I feel queasy.

797
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:32,086
And I feel humiliated.

798
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,339
What was that tonight? Was that foreplay?

799
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:36,423
What?

800
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:40,344
I-- I thought we were being
completely respectful.

801
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:42,596
-[scoffs]
-I think. I don't remember everything.

802
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,724
But I'm really,
really sorry about the gummy.

803
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:47,393
This isn't funny, Cane.

804
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:49,436
It's a little funny. [titters]

805
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:51,939
Peyton, you put the dinner together.

806
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:54,692
You didn't think
it would be, like, a little weird?

807
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:57,820
You are so glib when you should be
begging for forgiveness.

808
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:03,701
Peyton, please,
can we just, like, laugh it off?

809
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:05,285
[beeping as car unlocks]

810
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:08,163
I'm sorry, okay, baby? I'm sorry.

811
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:09,665
You were so obvious!

812
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:14,211
I wish you'd step out of your bullshit
for five seconds, look at what you are.

813
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:16,296
All you do is bitch about your dad.

814
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,633
He's a drunk. He's a pig.
He doesn't understand you.

815
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:23,387
But the joke's on you, hon,
'cause you're already him.

816
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:25,431
That is not true.

817
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:28,559
You just don't see it 'cause
you still got your training wheels on.

818
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:32,980
There's a problem with this metamorphosis
you're going through.

819
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:33,897
It's me.

820
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:39,403
I'm not your mother. I don't see things
the way she sees them, and I never will.

821
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:42,364
So turn your ass around
and start heading in the other direction

822
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:44,158
because I will only take so much.

823
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:49,705
[engine turns over]

824
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:53,500
[tires screeching]

825
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:01,633
[distant thunder rumbling]

826
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:05,763
[rain pattering]

827
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:10,768
[door opens]

828
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:17,649
-[thunder rumbling]
-[puffs]

829
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:25,449
Hiding from Mom?

830
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:26,950
No.

831
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:30,621
[Cane] Are you, uh,
having a little moment?

832
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,624
Peering into your soul?

833
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:35,209
Porter's a problem.

834
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:40,714
We have to find Grady…
and end ties with Porter.

835
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:45,052
[exhales]

836
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:48,055
Why did Porter set us up today?

837
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:50,557
That was for me.

838
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,310
He was testing me.

839
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:54,228
Testing us.

840
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:56,563
I thought we were gonna die.

841
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,857
[Harlan] You're not
on the sidelines anymore.

842
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:01,985
You're in it.
But you're gonna have to toughen up.

843
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:06,448
Okay.

844
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:08,450
[Cane sucks teeth]

845
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:11,703
You know, I wouldn't be so bold
as to expect a compliment

846
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:14,623
or a pat on the back
or anything like that, but…

847
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:19,795
I think we could both acknowledge
I'm the reason we didn't get killed today.

848
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:23,507
You think what you did was smart?

849
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:26,301
Smart? No, I wouldn't say that, but…

850
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,137
it was the truth.

851
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:32,140
And I was scared shitless, man.

852
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:34,184
[chuckles softly]

853
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:36,144
Yeah, it got a little scary.

854
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:38,689
I'm sorry I broke your rules.

855
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:43,151
You got lucky. You try that shit again,
I guarantee you'll be killed.

856
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:45,654
Here we go. Condemnation.

857
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:48,365
I'm looking out for you, son.
I'm trying to protect you.

858
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:49,700
Protect me?

859
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:55,122
I think the word you mean is "control,"
but that's okay. We can go with "protect."

860
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:58,542
You don't know this world the way I do.
You need to listen to me.

861
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:00,043
No, you need to listen to me.

862
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:04,840
I will do this,
but I'm gonna do it my own way.

863
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:06,383
I'm not worried about Porter.

864
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:10,429
You wouldn't either if you could just
put aside your ego for two seconds, Pop.

865
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:13,891
You're a fool.

866
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:15,976
[distant thunder rumbling]

867
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:18,061
At least I'm not you.

868
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:26,445
[pensive music playing]

869
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:38,332
[rain pattering]

870
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:41,209
[Marcus] Yeah?

871
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:44,212
-I found it.
-What?

872
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:46,256
Something Cane
doesn't want anyone to know.

873
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,258
And it will crucify him.

874
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,052
[Marcus exhales]

875
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:59,519
[Shawn] No, it is going to take more time,
because I barely had time to talk to him.

876
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:01,980
No, you need to have more patience--

877
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:07,903
I have to go. I'll call you back.

878
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:10,197
Well, that was heated.

879
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:11,698
[Shawn exhales]

880
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:13,158
Personal.

881
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:15,619
No worries.

882
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:19,373
-Let me give you a hand.
-Oh, no, ma'am.

883
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:23,543
I'm-- I'm almost done.
I was just about to take off.

884
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:30,425
Who are you?

885
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:35,347
I'm sorry?

886
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:38,183
You're a shit bartender.
You know that, right?

887
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:43,563
-Are you firing me?
-I called your references.

888
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:47,651
Granted, Bree should've
done that already, but you met her.

889
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:51,071
Turns out the Outback in Port Aransas,
where you claimed to work,

890
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:52,531
has no record of you.

891
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:55,367
Well, did you--
Did you talk to the manager?

892
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:58,120
They have such turnover, it's--
It's a mistake is all.

893
00:49:58,203 --> 00:49:59,538
The mistake, Shawn,

894
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:01,832
is that there is no Outback
in Port Aransas,

895
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:03,834
and there never has been.

896
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:06,795
[somber music playing]

897
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:10,882
Are you an informant?

898
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:13,468
A what?

899
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:15,679
Did the DEA send you?

900
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:18,015
-No, ma'am.
-You lying piece of shit.

901
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,558
-I'm not lying.
-One more time.

902
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:22,019
-My name is Shawn West.
-One more fucking time!

903
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:24,438
-Who are you?
-I told you. My name is Shawn West.

904
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:26,356
-I'm from Galveston.
-Don't fuck with me!

905
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,482
-[glass shatters]
-Okay!

906
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:29,151
-Do not!
-Bebe West!

907
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:33,739
Bebe?

908
00:50:36,074 --> 00:50:36,908
My mom.

909
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:38,618
[breathing heavily]

910
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:40,662
She died last month in Galveston.

911
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:44,291
Before she passed,
she told me Harlan Buckley was my father.

912
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:48,336
[somber music rising]

913
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,130
[exhales]

914

[brooding musical sting]

915
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:10,692
[gasps]

916
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:14,446
[breathing shakily]

917
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,406
[panting]

918
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:18,784
-Come here! Shut up!
-No! No! No!

919
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:22,704
No! Help! Somebody, please! Help me!

920
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:23,622
Help, help!

921
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:25,749
-[Peyton grunts]
-[violent thud]

922
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:27,459

923

[screaming]

924
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:33,381
Stop!

925
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:35,092
[Peyton coughs]

926
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:39,179
[shrieking]

927
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:44,518
Stop, stop!

928
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:47,145
[chilling music rising]

929
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:49,189
