how do you know he's telling the truth?

-That's enough, Cane. That's enough.
-No, I--

know the answer, Agent.

93

Yeah, well, I read what I could.

94
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:52,328
[chuckling] I do know
how he built the place back in the day.

95

-Probably also read it caught up to him.
-Yeah.

that would have the DEA sniffing around.

I went to Sheriff Porter's this morning
just to have another look around.

100

Yeah.

102
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,981

at the sheriff's house the night he died.

so you and your wife killed him.

114

about a murder charge.

115

What's this about, then?

116

Point me in the direction
of your supplier.

-If I get a bust, this footage disappears.
-I'm not talking to you without a lawyer.

118
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,192
You do that,
this camera goes into real evidence.

119
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,569
Sheriff Porter was a lawman.
They won't let that go.

120

Once they start investigating,
what else are they gonna find?

where Harlan Buckley is, would you?

-You're wrong about it.

148

-Wrong? Your father insinuated I'm not.
-You promised you'd leave them out of it.

149
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,413
And I will if they give me
the supplier's name.

I can't promise what my unit captain's
gonna do, but I meant every word.

151

What happened to the sheriff
was an accident. Even the police said so.

152

the information I have.

-I said I love you.

-It was met with deafening silence.
-Your feelings hurt?

-It's why you're doing this?
-My feelings aren't hurt!

because it's my fucking job!

All right?

I could have gone straight to the DA.

Had your whole fucking family called in
for questioning. I didn't because of you.

Now, if you can't tell them to cooperate,

163

'cause I'm not fucking stopping.

[Harlan] Grainy, but definitely us.

168
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,935
-Coming and going.
-Okay, the sheriff's body was cremated.

169
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:29,689
There's no weapon.
All Sanchez can do is put us at the scene.

170
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,857
If he keeps pushing, we lawyer up.

171
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,317
And say what?

172
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,945
Okay, listen to this.

173
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:39,699
You arrived,
found your old friend crushed to death.

174
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,325
Horrible shock.

175
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:47,289
You started having heart palpitations,
and in your confused state, you called me.

176
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:53,671
I came and helped you recover,
and then I left.

177
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:59,802
It's questionable, but then we hire
some fancy lawyers to answer questions.

178
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,389
Or we give them Grady.

179
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:07,601
No. We give him Grady,
he talks, and that leads back to us.

180
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,854
There's no way we can trust him or Grady.

181
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:12,898
Okay, okay. Don't let this get to you.

182
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,943
None of this matters
if your heart gives out, you hear me?

183
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:18,279
I'm fine, I swear.

184
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:22,658
I have a damn machine sewn into my chest.
It better be good for something.

185
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:24,994
We will figure this out.

186

[indistinct chatter]

187
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,139
Hey.

188
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,601
-You said he didn't have anything.
-I didn't think he did.

189
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:49,602
Wrong again, Bree.

190
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,771
He doesn't want to charge them.
He needs the supplier.

191
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,607
You think they could pass over
that information without consequence?

192
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,776
Were they really there, at the sheriff's?

193
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,904
According to the security footage,
yes, they were, Bree.

194
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,741
I was never trying to hurt them.

195
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,785
No, of course not. Just me, right?

196
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,206
Did you tell Dad about me and Marcus?

197
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,874
-No.
-Okay.

198
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,919
He's gonna find out soon enough
once we all do life in prison.

199
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:19,256
-Congrats, you burned it all down again.
-No. No, I can fix this. I'm--

200
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,217
No, you can't fix it!

201
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,011
You want to know why?
Because you always break shit.

202
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:28,224
-What's gonna happen when Dad finds out?
-He doesn't need--

203
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,935
He still believes in your bullshit.
I'm done with it.

204
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,855
I mean, Dad, this is going to kill him.

205
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,776
This is on you.

215

Other boats come through as well.
All the fishermen wanna unload here.

216
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,815
It's the biggest fish house around.
They all come to us.

217
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,817
[Grady] Whoa, that's so impressive.

218
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,569

219
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,487
Diller? What's going on?

00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:26,615

-Hey, Nate.

You're done for the day.

No, I'm not.

228

You got the truck parked in the back?

Nope, floated in on a boat.
That shipment should be here soon.

Where's your dad?

-Next door. You want me to call him over?
-At the restaurant?

[Diller] Yeah, I guess so.

248

I shouldn't be here with you.

-What? Did something happen?

Okay.

252
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:47,112
The truth is that your mom
ruins everything she touches,

she always has, and this time
she managed to do it sober.

00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:21,511
Look, we've got a lot to do,
and you can't be here.

[chuckles]

336
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,267
I can't?

337
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:31,563
You want to discuss the schedule,

338
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:34,107
the amount of runs,
how smooth everything's going?

339
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,818

Uh-huh.

Oh, shit. Um…

346
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,418
Okay, yeah, send me your location.

347

Well, you'll get your wish, cutie pie.

348
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,590
I gotta bounce.
You're coming with me, though.

[Belle] Hi, how'd it go?

00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,823
-Badly.
-What happened?

356
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,536
What happened is you killed the land deal,
now we're stuck with him.

357
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,037
That's what happened.

How long have you been working
at the fish house?

[scoffs]

378
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:22,442
I ran into old man Devin today.
He asked how you like mopping fish guts.

379
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:26,988
I had no idea what he's talking about.
Why would I? I'm only your father.

How long?

381
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,537
Not long. It was just a couple of shifts.

382
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,746
But it ends today.

383
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,707
It's a job for my granddad.
I'm a Buckley too, you know?

384
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:40,669
You'll never be a Buckley, ever.

385

Quiet. You're fine.

This is a misunderstanding.

407

that you were a part of this?

you have that badge, so listen up.

The Buckley accounts
are in your parents' names,

446
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,412
and the land deal is confidential
per your mother's request.

447

-But you know about it.
-Well, yes. I do all the revisions.

458
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:45,497

Mr. Benson is working
with a bigger bank up in Raleigh.

460

And nobody thought to tell
any of us this is happening?

Well, it hasn't gone through.

462
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,714
If it does, they have to notify you.

00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:57,217
-Well, your parents, I guess.

He knows how to keep his mouth shut.

472

You're not gonna have any more problems
on these runs. Isn't that right?

473
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,411
I'm here to protect and serve.

474
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,955
It was my mistake not knowing
you're all friends of the family.

475
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,916
I don't know, man.
It'd be easier if I just kill him.

476
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:33,628
Uh, easier than having
the sheriff in your pocket? Be smart.

477
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,755
Well, it'd be cleaner.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay, come on.

I'll do it, I'll do it, all right?

Ask Harlan, I…

483
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:48,643
I did everything he wanted me to
with the sheriff. Cleaned up the reports.

484
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:51,187
I did everything I could with the DEA guy,
like he asked.

485
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:52,856
DEA?

486
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:55,483
What DEA guy?
What's he talking about, DEA guy?

487
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,527
One agent stayed behind.

488
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:00,488
He's been trying to make a case,
grabbing at straws.

489
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:01,656
He's got nothing.

490
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,577
You're being watched?
This why you tried to push me out earlier?

491
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,204
Not watched, just playing it safe.

But for now,
we gotta get Drew back in his patrol car

495
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:18,923
before people start wondering
what happened to their sheriff.

00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:35,148
-Are we good?
-[Drew breathing heavily]

504
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:37,108
Absolutely.

505
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,152
Okay, let's get you back to work.

506
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:43,239
Wait, what am I talking about?
Look at you. Y-- You're a mess. Come here.

507
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:44,532
Help you out here.

508
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,534
Boop-boop-boop-boop-boop.

509
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,911
Yep, there we go.

510
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:50,622
You don't look so bad.
Let's tuck you in a little bit.

511
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:51,539
There we go.

512
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:57,170
Get some water on that face, okay?
Maybe a… little bit of ice.

513
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:58,713
All right, now listen.

514
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:00,799
It's pretty simple, all right?

515
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,342
You're good to me,

516
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:04,636
I'm good to you.

517
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:05,595
Okay?

518
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,431
Okay, get out of here, you little punk.

519
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,313
Drew.

520
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:19,692
Figure out how to explain your face
before you get back. Got it?

521
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:22,278
-For you.
-[grim music playing]

522
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,280
Take it.

523
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:26,533
[firmly] Take it.

524
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,499
[grim music continues]

525
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,176
Fantastic.

526
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:48,972
[thunder rumbles in distance]

527
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:59,274
Did you know
what Wes is up to with the bank?

528
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,777
Sounds like a conversation
we should not be having here.

529
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,280
Too bad. Hey.

530
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,782
He's gonna take the land
right out from under us.

531
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,410
I didn't sign the contracts.
The deal is not going through.

532
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:13,955
Yeah, okay, you didn't sign them,
but you did show him our finances.

533
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:17,125
-I had to. It's standard.
-Oh my God.

534
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,919
Okay, well, now he knows we're vulnerable,

535
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:22,463
and I'm guessing he didn't like
being used and discarded.

536
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:25,258
-Hey, whatever you think, it--
-Yeah, I don't care.

537
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,552
I don't care that you and Dad
have a toxic marriage.

538
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:29,846
You're cheating on each other,
got secret kids, whatever.

539
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:31,848
-I don't care. I don't have time.
-You're a child.

540
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:34,934
I'm trying to figure out what the hell
we'll do when our debt gets called up

541
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,394
and we don't have the money.

542
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:41,232
Can they really do that?
Can they take the land?

543
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,986
-Why don't you ask your boyfriend?
-Watch it.

544
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:50,033
I liked it better
when you and Dad hated each other.

545
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,085
Hey.

546
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,129
I was hoping we could talk.

547
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:05,089
Sure, <i>bro.</i>

548
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,258
We can do that.

549
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:16,643
What's up?

550
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:18,811
I wanted to maybe answer
any questions you might have.

551
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,272
[chuckles softly]

552
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,483
Okay, sure.

553
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:28,529
You said you came here 'cause
you wanted to get to know us, right?

554
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:32,241
Um, forgive me if that sounds
a little like… like bullshit.

555
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:35,119
Look, I don't know how to prove to you
that I'm not after anything.

556
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,537
Nothing concrete, anyway--

557
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,415
I guess I just don't understand
what you're looking for.

558
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,835
-'Cause you already have it.
-What's that?

559
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,253
You have a family.

560
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,755
Support, a place you belong.

561
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:49,175
Look, man, all that stuff
is just one big fucking trap.

562
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:52,887
Okay? As you can tell
by my suppressed anger.

563
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:56,391
-I mean, I speak from experience here.
-Yeah, it's not so suppressed.

564
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:00,436
Okay.

565
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:10,279
What is it that you want, Shawn?

566
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,535
When my mom died, I lost everything.

567
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,205
I thought that maybe
there was something here for me.

568
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,335
Whatever's here,

569
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:26,546
you don't want it.

570
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,506
Okay?

571
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:31,592
You came, you saw what you wanted to see,

572
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:34,387
and you should probably leave
while you still can.

573
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:37,181
Because trust me, you don't…

574
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,018
You don't want to end up here.

575
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:49,193
[somber music playing]

576
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:12,216
[thunder rumbles]

577
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,022
[Bree] Hey.

578
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:32,070
What's going on?

579
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:36,574
Oh, come on. We both knew this was coming.

580
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:44,082
Rehab dries you out for a bit,
but this is my true form.

581
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,253
What am I looking at?

582
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,381
A fucking train wreck. [chuckles]

583
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:54,759
Hey, come on.

584
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:56,094
It's true.

585
00:34:58,638 --> 00:34:59,639
[sniffles]

586
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:01,891
You know it's true.

587
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:13,319
I mean, look at the family I come from.

588
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:15,530
You want to send them all to prison.

589
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:16,572
They're bad.

590
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:20,660
You think I'm bad too.

591
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:22,954
You can get out.

592
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:25,540
You're not involved in any of it.

593
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:28,376
-You can get away from it all.
-How?

594
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:30,670
With you?

595
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:35,216
I know it's your job.

596
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:40,471
You deserve a win,

597
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:43,641
and I want that for you.

598
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:46,686
I do.

599
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,771
We can leave together.

600
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:52,733
I won't let any of the fallout touch you,
I promise you that.

601
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,129
Where'd you get it?

602
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:16,591
[Bree] My favorite dealer. [sighs]

603
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,439
I got scared when you said you loved me.

604
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:32,565
Why?

605
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:35,526
Because…

606
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,654
Because if this were real,

607
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,490
you know I'd have to choose.

608
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:43,910
You or them.

609
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:48,789
-Bree, come on now.
-It's too late now.

610
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:52,251
[gentle music aches softly]

611
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,212
I'm sorry I couldn't say it.

612
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:58,382
I'm a coward.

613
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:02,053
That's the last thing you are.

614
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:14,398
[Marcus grunts]

615
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:20,696
You taste like whiskey.

616
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:24,659
You said it was your favorite.

617
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,662
[gentle music continues]

618
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:54,647
[Harlan] We need
to slow down these deliveries.

619
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:57,692
I don't wanna store this shit
on my boats between runs.

620
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:58,901
Why?

621
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,570
You worried about that DEA sitch?

622
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:04,240
I told you that wasn't a problem.

623
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:06,742
I like this relationship.

624
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:09,245
Honestly, I look up to you, man.

625
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,332
Let's not change that.

626
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,334
Okay?

627
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,796
So it's business as usual, then?

628
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:22,049
Absolutely, but usual means cautious.

629
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:26,512
Good, because let me be
perfectly clear on my end.

630
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,180
There can be no DEA.

631
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,767
You've seen how I do things, right?

632
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:34,437
You need to solve this problem.

633
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:36,731
Period.

634
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:42,987
Like I said, there's no problem.

635
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:45,698
Fantastic.

636
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,244
[ominous music playing]

637
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:01,255
[Cane] Dad.

638
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:04,425
Dad, listen to me.

639
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:07,094
We can't--
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey.

640
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:10,431
Drew says Sanchez
is at the Crystal Cove Motel.

641
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,142
What do you plan on doing with that?

642
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:16,103
Dad, no.

643
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:19,357
We are not those people.
That's not how we deal with our problems.

644
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,735
We are those people,
and it's exactly how we deal with them.

645
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:25,488
You're either all in or dead.
That's the way it works.

646
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:28,032
-You know this is the solution.
-I do not. Listen to me. Hey.

647
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:31,369
Hey, just-- just let me deal with this.
Let me talk to Sanchez. I'll deal with it.

648
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:34,955
-Dad, hey, let me talk to Sanchez.
-Cane! We are done talking!

[suspenseful music playing]

00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:13,702
[Cane] Dad, what did you do?

654
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:15,287
Found him this way.

655
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,001
We can't be here.

656
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:23,170
We gotta go.

657
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,464
We have to find the camera.

658
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:28,968
Look for his iPhone, laptop, anything.

659
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,386
Oh, Jesus.

Dad, we gotta go.

Hey, hey, hey, seriously.
We need to go now!

Come on. Come on.

665
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:12,470
For all we know,
his dealer stole his camera.

666
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:15,264
If it surfaces, we deal with it then.

667
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:19,393
This shit really doesn't affect you, huh?

668
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:22,563
No, it affects me, but it doesn't stop me.

669
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:33,991
