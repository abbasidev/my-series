181
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,185
He had theories, not a lot of facts.

182
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:06,022
We gotta destroy all this stuff.

183
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,190
Can't just trash it.

184
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,277
I don't wanna be, like, nosy or anything,
but where's Peyton?

185
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,614
Peyton took Savannah
to her folks' place for a while.

186
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,324
Oh, shit.

187
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:17,950
Yeah.

188
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:24,790
-How about you try and get more sleep?
-I can't.

189
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,419
Can't turn my brain off.

190
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:33,507
Just lay there thinking about him
and thinking about using,

191
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,384
and I can still see him.

192
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,927
His eyes stopped moving.

193
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,305
It was like Granddad.

194
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,557
What do you mean, like Granddad?

195
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,268
The night he died.

196
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,813
But you didn't see him, you were asleep.

197

They found you asleep in your bed.

198
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,906
Is that not what happened?

199
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:04,872
-I was staying with him that weekend.
-No, I know the story.

200
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:06,666
You know a version of the story.

[intriguing music playing]

202
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,588
I was still awake in the living room,

203
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,007
and we heard a noise.

204
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,385
I didn't know what it was, but he did.

205
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,222

206
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:23,265
<i>-Yeah.</i>
<i>-Yeah, he hid me in there.</i>

207
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:27,853
And he told me to stay quiet
and not come out, no matter what.

208
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:31,190
But I could-- I could still see.

209

[grunting echoes]

210
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,528
And-- and there were two men.

211
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,698
Not one, like the cop said,
there were two of them.

212
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,366

213

And I was…

216
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:50,876
I was… too scared to help.

217
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,795
I was too scared to move, so…

218
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,718
[breathes shakily]
And then they were gone.

219
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,556
So I went to him.

220
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,442
And there was blood every-- everywhere.

221
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,445
But he was still alive.

Why didn't I know about this?

225
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:32,168
Mom made me promise
that I would never tell anyone.

226
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:38,174
She said if I pretended it never happened,
it would be the same as if it didn't.

227

But you were a child.

about the bad shit.

234

Right, Grandpa?

It'll give us a chance to finish our chat.
Did you open up your little box?

Yes, thanks for the extra, but--

00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,238
Now I can let the dust settle

348
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:01,158
and move on with whatever it is
I'm gonna move on to.

349
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:03,577
Can I give you some unsolicited advice?

350
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,289
Maybe it's time to take stock.

351
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:11,335
Tell the truth, do the right thing,
be a good person,

352
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,212
and the rest will fall into place.

353
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,340
It seems like you've lost your way, Belle.
I'm sorry.

354
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:27,267
Well, have fun.
Be safe, all right? Bye, baby.

355
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:29,478
Who's that?

356
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:30,812
Savannah.

357
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:34,608
-She's riding a horse today.
-[chuckles dryly]

358
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,903
When's Peyton coming back?

359
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:40,530
I don't know.

360
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,119
Does this have anything to do
with Jenna being back?

361
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,122
Not today's topic, Bree.

362
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,043
[gentle music playing]

363
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:54,753
Are you sleeping with her?

364
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,673
-Jesus Christ, Bree.
-What?

365
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,426
-I'm not-- I'm not judging.
-No. I'm not fuck--

366
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,469
I get it. I get it.

367
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:06,348
Look, you guys have a connection.
You always have, everyone sees it.

368
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:12,312
I'm sure even Peyton knows it down deep.

369
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:15,983
I'm married to Peyton.

370
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,192
Yeah, but be honest.

371
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,153
Would you have married Peyton
if she hadn't gotten pregnant?

372
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:25,367
Well, I mean,
that's kind of more you than me.

373
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,538
I just… thought we were being honest.

374
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:37,796
[sputters] Yeah, I--
I would've married Peyton anyway.

375
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,048
I mean,

376
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,010
what else was I gonna do?

377
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,104
Oh, up, up, up, up.

378
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:59,026
Ah, crap,
I didn't have the things lined up.

379
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,945
Don't worry about the sight line.
Trust your gut.

380
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:04,489
Oh!

381
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,453
[Harlan] Nice shooting, son.

382
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,373
Your grandson looks up to you.

383
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,334
Don't all kids?

384
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:16,835
Nope.

385
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:18,879
Not all of them.

386
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:23,467
[Harlan] Birds have slowed down.
Might be time to head back.

387
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,802
Come on, man, I haven't got one yet.

388
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:28,096
Well, take mine back to your boys.

389
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:31,183
Tell them some great story
and have a feast.

390
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,520
See, you do something like that…

391
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:40,650
it makes it impossible
for me not to like you.

392
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:46,323
Look, I'm willing
to chalk today up to growing pains,

393
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:50,327
but you can't just swing by the fish house
with an emergency shipment.

394
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,536
It's sloppy.

395
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:55,374
Okay.

396
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,376
I can hear you on that.

397
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,753
-[bird chirping]
-Oh.

398
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,340
-Here we go.
-Too low.

399
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:05,133
-Too low. Too low!
-No, I got it.

400
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,551
-[gunshot]
-[grunts]

401
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:07,469
Diller!

402
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,304
[frantic music playing]

403
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:13,809
Get the fucking truck!

404
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:23,735
I need help!

405
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:24,861
I got him!

406
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,530
Page the SOD and prep OR2.

407
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:27,489
[man] Got it.

408
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:28,615
Let's go!

409
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:34,621
-[Harlan] Hang in there, son.
-Sir, we'll come find you with an update.

410
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:47,968
[Cane] Hey, Bree.

411
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,929
You gotta get up.
We gotta go. It's Diller.

412
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,013
What?

413
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,560
[Shawn] Mrs. Buckley?

414
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,062
Harlan's been trying to reach you.

415
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,816
[tense music playing]

416
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,782
Hi, excuse me.
Um, Diller Hopkins, I'm his mother.

417
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:14,077
-104. I'll need to buzz you in.
-Thank you.

418
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,162
[buzzing]

419
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,501
Oh my God. Oh my God. Where is he?

420
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,003
-He's okay.
-What happened?

421
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:24,296
It was a hunting accident.

422
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:27,382
Doctor said he got grazed,
a little birdshot in his arm and chest.

423
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,301
He was shot? Who shot him?

424
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,178
-He's gonna be okay.
-I wanna see him.

425
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:33,472
-They're not done. You can't go in.
-Fuck that.

426
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:35,765
-Let me go!
-They're still working on him.

427
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,310
He's fine. He's gonna be okay.

428
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:40,896
-Everything is okay, I promise you.
-[crying]

429
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:43,773
He's fine. Just breathe. Just breathe.

430
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:47,944
-Hey.
-Hey.

431
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,279
Where is he?

432
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:52,657
Bree's in there with him right now,
but he's… he's okay.

433
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,826
Is it true that Grady shot him?

434
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:58,497
I don't know all the details, but… yeah.

435
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,624
-Unbelievable.
-Mrs. Buckley?

436
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,460
-Uh, yes?
-Your husband is asking to see you.

437
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,212
-I'll see you in a minute.
-Yeah.

438
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:09,799
I'm here to see my son, Diller Hopkins.

439
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:15,263
-We can only accept one visitor at a time.
-It's okay, hon. You go, I'll wait here.

440
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:18,308
You both have to wait.
His mother's with him.

441
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,143
This is the boy's father.

442
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:23,230
I can let her know you're here,
if you can take a seat.

443
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:25,857
-No, I don't think so.
-No, babe, not now.

444
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:28,818
Thank you.

445
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:44,793
Hey.

446
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,504
Wow.

447
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,298
You look like shit.

448
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:55,845
So do you.

449
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,099
We can't be in the same room together.

450
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:01,560
It's not allowed.

451
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:03,687
Yeah, well,

452
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:07,941
I'd like to see someone try to move me.

453
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,568
I'm not going anywhere.

454
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:12,320
[gentle music playing]

455
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:29,462
[line calling]

456
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:32,549
[phone buzzing]

457
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,093
Why are you calling me?

458
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:36,928
[Cane] <i>What do you mean?</i>

459
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:39,556
Thought we weren't
gonna see each other anymore.

460
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:42,267
I'm calling you on the phone.

461
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,144
<i>You found a loophole.</i>

462
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,605
Is everything okay?

463
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:50,692
What's wrong?

464
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:53,778
Uh…

465
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,409
A lot, a lot.

466
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:00,785
A lot is wrong.

467
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,830
<i>Do you wanna talk about it?</i>

468
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,042
Mm… No.

469
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,048
Do you remember
how anxious I was in school?

470
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:17,552
With every test and paper due,
I had so much anxiety.

471
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,179
Yeah, I remember.

472
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:22,766
And whenever I got worried or upset,
you would say,

473
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:24,893
"You're an idiot. What is your problem?"

474
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:28,104
"You're the smartest person I know.
You got this."

475
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,607
<i>I'm gonna throw that back in your face,</i>
<i>you're welcome.</i>

476
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:31,816
[chuckles]

477
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,528
Yeah, you always have my back.

478
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,572
It's easy, you're a good person.

479
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,324
<i>I don't know about that.</i>

480
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:40,492
<i>It's true.</i>

481
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:43,411
I really wish
I was the person you thought I was.

482
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,621
You are.

483
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,292
Well, thank you, Jenna.

484
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,294
Okay, good night.

485
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:53,296
Good night.

486
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,639
Grady shot our grandson.

487
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,599
I told you, it was an accident.

488
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:05,975
Are you sure?

489
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,602
I was there.

490
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:10,980
Listen, I want him out of our lives.
I don't care how bad things get.

491
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:13,525
This is too far, I won't stand for it.

492
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:14,859
I'll take care of it.

493
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,820
What does that even mean?

494
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:20,156
It means I'll take care of it.
Diller is fine, it scared him more than--

495
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,242
You are taking this too lightly.

496
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:23,868
I said I will handle it.

497
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:28,581
-You can't handle everything, Harlan.
-Let's just bring it down a notch, okay?

498
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,041
Don't you get it?

499
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,419
Our luck has run out.

500
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:34,546
It's all fallen to shit
right in front of us.

501
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:38,341
-We'll figure this out like we always do.
-You're not listening.

502
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,927
I know Grady is a problem,
but he's a problem I can fix.

503
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,555
You think you can fix everything,
but you can't.

504
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:45,682
Some things are out of your reach.

505
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:49,352
-Do we really need to do this right here?
-My God.

506
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:57,485
You think you can fix everything?

507
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:01,322
Fix this.

508
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:02,782
[foreboding music playing]

509
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:03,950
What is it?

510
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:05,827
The end, Harlan.

511
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:07,871
It's the end.

512
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,583
I told you our luck has run out.

513
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:34,898
How is he?

514
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:38,067
Uh, he's… he's in a little pain,

515
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:41,654
but the doctor said
overall his injuries are fairly minor.

516
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:43,698
How is getting shot in the chest
fairly minor?

517
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:48,620
I don't know, that's just what he said.
"Superficial lacerations, fairly minor."

518
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:50,955
[scoffs] How can you let this happen?

519
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:55,794
-He was with my dad.
