00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,843
Lynette must be proud
her husband is the new sheriff.

176
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,805
Acting sheriff. Until elections.

177
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,307
That was always the plan, Drew.

178
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,893
You told me that
back when you were a squirt.

179
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,603
I never forgot that.

180
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,690
Look, Belle's on the town council.

181
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:28,067
She has lots of sway.

182
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,861
With their support,
I'm sure you'll do fine.

183
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,489
Thank you, sir.
That's very kind of you both.

184
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,991
We're family.

185
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,410
You'll always have our support, Drew.

186
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,998
Cane.

187
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,167
-Cane, did you hear me?
-Mm?

188
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,085
What?

189
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:47,878
I said, are you okay?

190
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,046
You're awfully quiet.

191
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,424
Yeah, I'm-- I'm fine.

192
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,509
I got a lot going on right now.

193
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,678
You seem really stressed.

194
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,265
[huffs] I'm fine.

195
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:05,605
Whoa. Whoa!

196
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,857
Okay. Hey, what are you doing?

197
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,443
You remember
that little restaurant in Seattle?

198
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:11,527
[Cane exhales]

199
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,238
Yes.

200
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,740
Right on the water?

201
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:18,117
The food was so good.

202
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,077
What are you doing?

203
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,413
Actually, I don't even remember
what we ate.

204
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,999
I just remember what we did.

205
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,755
Stop, stop. Stop, Peyton. Stop.

206
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:40,848
Hey.

207
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,852
What you staring at?

208
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,773
Porter's family don't seem too torn up.

209
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:52,860
I knew he was divorced
but didn't know the extent of things.

210
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,988
[man] Harlan.

211
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:57,573
Hello, Belle.

212
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,117
What the hell are you doing here?

213
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,411
Just paying my respects.

214
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,830
Clyde and I go way back, you know that.

215
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,040
Hello, Emmett.

216
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:09,877
It's always a surprise to see you.
If you'll excuse us--

217
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,088
Now, Harlan, I heard a nasty little rumor

218
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,632
that you dipped your toe
back in the water.

219
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:18,302
Now, I'm-- I'm hurt
that you didn't even call me.

220
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,096
-You heard wrong.
-Huh.

221
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:24,600
And if it were true,
you'd be the last man on earth I'd call.

222
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,853
[tense music playing]

223
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,563
Pretty as ever, Belle.

224
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,193
I saw him at the service.

225
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,321
I didn't think he'd show up here.

226
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:40,700
Oh, thank you. Thanks so much.

227
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,331
-Um… Hi.
-I saw your Aunt Sophia.

228
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:50,418
-She's looking good.
-Yeah… Yeah.

229
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:55,840
I'm sorry about dinner the other night,
that wasn't my normal--

230
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,717
You don't usually get high
with married men?

231
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,343
[sighs resignedly]

232
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,178
Where's Scott?

233
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,972
-He had to go to work.
-Mm.

234
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,060
Should I be worried?

235
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,856
I… I know what it must look like,

236
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:16,652
but it's--
it's just old memories resurfacing.

237
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,447
Nostalgia. It's… It's nothing more.

238
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,533
Do you really believe that?

239
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,287
Look, let's just put it out there.

240
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,080
We've barely seen each other
over the years.

241
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:31,041
You may not remember much about me,
so I need to clue you in a little.

242
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,086
I was really hoping
that we could be friends.

243
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:38,716
I'm not saying this to guilt you
or appeal to some girl code nonsense,

244
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,509
but to be straight up honest.

245
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,470
I cut deep, Jenna.

246
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:46,390
And if you touch my husband,
I will come for you.

247
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,937
[indistinct chatter]

248
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,484
Hey there, I'm Cane Buckley.

249
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:59,153
I, uh, saw you inside with my folks.

250
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:01,238
Were you friends with the sheriff or…?

251
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,865
Just paying my respects.

252
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,954
Huh! [chuckles]
You don't remember me, do you?

253
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:10,539
No.

254
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,626
Well, I haven't seen you
since you were a kid,

255
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,878
but I remember going
to a few of your games.

256
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,214
Your dad and I used to work together.

257
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,799
Your grandfather.

258
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:21,967
Are you a fisherman or…?

259
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,304
[chuckles softly]

260
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,599
I've been hearing a lot about you, Cane.

261
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:33,813
I thought you'd make a run at pro ball,
but you found something else to do.

262
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:34,897
Didn't you?

263
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,193
-Uh, I didn't get your name.
-Emmett Parker.

264
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,322
-Got it.
-May I give you my number?

265
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:48,244
Your dad used to have my number.
It's just in case he's lost it.

266
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:51,038
[quietly foreboding music creeping in]

267
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,961
If ever you find yourself
in need of something to do,

268
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:01,173
other than what you're doing
and who you're doing it with…

269
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,678
please, give me a call.

270
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,393
[foreboding music continues]

271
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:20,860
[uneasy sting]

272
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:30,035
What the fuck…

273
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,330
[Marcus] The sheriff was no accident.
He was murdered.

274
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:34,915
How do you know that?

275
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,543
I think he came across something
that proves Cane is dirty.

276
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,920
-[laughs]
-All right.

277
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,506
[chuckling] No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

278
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,259
Cane may be crooked,
but he is not a killer.

279
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:46,635
-Okay.
-You seem fired up.

280
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,220
-I'm not.
-You're not thinking clearly.

281
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,889
I know it's a lot to process.

282
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,725
Your brother's in deep shit.

283
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,561
A lot more than you thought.

284
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:59,523
If someone killed the sheriff,
it was not my brother, I can assure you.

285
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,233
He does not have it in him.

286
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,069
I gotta get back.

287
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,363
[Marcus] Okay.

288
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,759
I wondered where you went.

289
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:29,970
Right here.

290
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,892
Nice breeze, isn't it?

291
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:40,356
My dad's been in my head a lot today.

292
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:42,816
What happened…

293
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,861
I don't wanna put you
in that kind of hurt.

294
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,989
If you wanna stop, we'll stop.

295
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,952
I'm not gonna lie. I'm scared.

296
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:58,332
The money's helping.
We're starting to breathe again.

297
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:01,210
Three or four more runs
will get us out of trouble.

298
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,713
Whether you like it or not,
you're good at this.

299
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,424
It's brought you back to life somehow.

300
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,680
I don't wanna lose everything we've built.

301
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,057
Everything my dad built.

302
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,350
The land.

303
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,645
Then we keep going

304
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,855
a little while longer.

305
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:28,445
Just when I know what you're thinking,
you go and surprise me.

306
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,698
Is that a good thing?

307
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,032
Oh, yeah.

308
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,325
Yeah?

309
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:41,583
Hey! Got your text.

310
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,544
What's the emergency?

311
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:46,380
Whoa, okay.
You need to let go of me right now.

312
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:47,840
Jesus Christ.

313
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:55,055
-What were you doing with the DEA agent?
-Were you spying on me?

314
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,640
Are you fucking him?

315
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,642
I don't think that's any
of your damn business.

316
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,352
-[Cane scoffs]
-Okay?

317
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,646
[Cane scoffs louder]

318
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:07,067
-How could you do something so stupid?
-Stupid? Why would it be stupid?

319
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,028
Unless you're involved
in something illegal,

320
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,196
in which case it's your problem, not mine.

321
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,532
Just when I think you can't get any lower.

322
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:17,411
-I'm not the one stoopin' here.
-Why do you hate me so much?

323
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:20,789
-Answer that for yourself.
-You still mad about the court hearings?

324
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,541
Seriously? We've moved past that.

325
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,376
My child was taken from me.

326
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,420
I will never move past that.

327
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:29,339
-I get you don't like the way things went.
-Oh, you get it?

328
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:32,926
But bottom line is,
you were a danger to your son.

329
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,971
I was declared an unfit mother
because of your testimony!

330
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,224
-You burned a house with your kid in it!
-I pulled him out--

331
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,060
How is that my fault?

332
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,896
You never should've come for me!
You took him from me!

333
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:45,647
Took? He works at the fish house!

334
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,859
-You can see him anytime you want!
-But he's not with me!

335
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:51,195
I'm not his mother anymore because of you!

336
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:52,613
No, because of you!

337
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:56,784
Take some accountability
for once in your life, Bree!

338
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:59,411
Jesus Christ, I'm tired of your bullshit!

339
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,413
-You're complaining. You think--
-[thwack]

340
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,082
Oh! Ow!

341
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,168
[Cane groans]

342
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,669
Fuck, man.

343
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:08,879
[groans]

344
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:11,799
Ow…

345
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,383
I screwed up.

346
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,177
I own it.

347
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,389
All you had to do was say nothing.

348
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:20,808
That's it. Nothing.

Oh, Mr. Truth Teller.

all of our assets for it.

Yeah?

395
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,790
…it bothered you
to see them so unaffected, huh?

396
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:52,459
The word apathetic came to mind.

397

-Mm.
-Is that the right word?

398
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,171
That works.

I have no idea
what happened with that family.

We're not like them.

I wanted to meet you
before I dropped a bomb on your life.

I wanted to know you.

so I understand--

419

Stop, please.

420

I'm only sorry it took this long.

423

I didn't know. Bebe never told me.

It's what she wanted.

425
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:48,450
Your mother was
a far better person than me.

426
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,744
That's for sure.

427
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,915
I was in a bad place back then.

428
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,544
Not sure I'm any better now, to be honest.

429
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:03,632
Belle tells me you're a lawyer.

430
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:06,134
I graduated law school.

431

UT Austin. I haven't, um…
I haven't taken the bar yet.

432
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:16,728
I bet Bebe was proud of you.

433

[gentle music rising]

434
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,526
She worked here years ago.

435
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:24,986
It was a much smaller place.

436
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,906
Just a few employees then.

437
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:31,118
She was good with people.

438
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,912
So beautiful.

439
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:40,335
And she had this laugh
that could blow the roof off.

440
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,504
She was here a few summers.

441
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:46,466
And I was already married.

442
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,886
But we got close.

443
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:53,557
We both felt guilty the whole time.

444
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:56,351
Then she up and left one day.

445
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,477
Ended it.

446
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,814

was your way of connecting with me?

00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:48,268
You are a part of this family.
Don't be silly.

527
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:50,437
Don't dismiss me, please. It--

528
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,899
I get it. I've screwed up.

529
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:59,404
I've exhausted every ounce
of goodwill, but I am trying.

530
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,281
And I'm sober.

531
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,450
And that's a good thing.

532
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,452
But you've been sober before.

533
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:08,371
Why does that have
to relegate me to the outside?

534
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:12,083
I have always been
on the fringe of this family.

535
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:15,295
We have been through this before.

536
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:18,715
-Okay? Get a little time on your side.
-That's not what I'm talking about.

537
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:21,885
You set the temperature in this family.
You always have.

538
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:24,262
I wanna be a part of it.

539
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:26,723
I wanna be a part of it the way Cane is.

540
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:28,850
Why-- It's so different for me.

541
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:33,354
-You are my child too, honey.
-No, I'm what became of your child.

542
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,731
Isn't that what you mean?

543
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:36,149
My God. See?

544
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:38,026
You do it to yourself.

545
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,737
You put yourself on the outside.

546
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,406
You want to be included? Earn it.

547
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,450
Stay sober. Show up.

548
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:47,535
We're all here waiting for you.

549
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:55,835
I wish you'd seen me as an ally
and not an obstacle.

550
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:01,007
We could've been
so much more to each other.

551
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,968
None of this would've happened.

552
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:07,555
You're talking in riddles, hon.
What's really going on, huh?

553
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,224
Just forget about it.

554
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,433
I'll deal with it.

555
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:14,521
-Deal with what?
-I gotta get ready.

556
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:16,731
-I'll talk to you later.
-Bree! Come on.

557
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,401
[phone buzzing]

558
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:23,279
[pensive music playing]

559
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:41,589
The shrimp season has been pure crap.

560
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:44,592
But with fall coming,

561
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:48,012
the blue crab and trout
are coming in strong.

562
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:51,516
And your father started this place?

563
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:54,602
The fish house came first
and then the restaurant.

564
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,813
Then we expanded over the years.

565
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,525
Sorry if I'm asking too many questions.

566
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:03,820
And thank you
for taking the time to show me everything.

567
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:06,781
-What your family has built is impressive.
-[chuckles softly]

568
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,158
Lawyers are impressive.

569
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:11,369
I wouldn't encourage this as a career.

570
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:13,204
It's a dying industry.

571
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:16,291
But until it does die, or I die,

572
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:17,500
here I am.

573
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:20,003
What's next for you?

574
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,006
Go to Texas and study for the bar.

575
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:26,175
I missed it this year,
so I've applied to take it in February.

576
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:27,886
I see.

577
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,431
You can always stay here a little longer.

578
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,225
If you want.

579
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,479
Thank you.

580
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:44,903
-[Cane] Wes.
-Yeah.

581
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,404
Hey. Cane Buckley.

582
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:48,072
-Yes.
-Thank you for meeting me.

583
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,533
-I know it's last minute.
-Oh, no. Is, uh…

584
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:53,953
-Is Belle joining us?
-Uh, she's not here.

585
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:57,290
It's just the two of us.
I thought maybe we could talk alone.

586
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:58,583
Great.

587
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:01,794
Look, my mom has done
a total 180 with this whole thing

588
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:05,590
and, uh, it's just… Well, it's what
I wanted to talk to you about.

589
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:08,259
We've been working this deal out
for months now,

590
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:11,763
and I guess I just want to understand
what made it fall apart

591
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:15,016
so I could talk to her,
and maybe get everything back on track.

592
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:19,938
Yes, uh, if the issue was the negotiation,
that would be one thing.

593
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:21,522
What do you mean?

594
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:24,359
I don't think
the deal points were the problem.

595
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,363
Your mother never even responded
to the finalized terms.

596
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:29,989
Huh.

597
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:33,409
Um, okay, so what went wrong?

598
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,411
We met,

599
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:39,207
we talked through the whole thing,
got real, got personal,

600
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:42,835
she got cold feet, and, uh, it happens.

601
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:45,129
Uh, what do you mean, personal?

602
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:50,468
Look, Cane, I don't want to get involved
in any family drama or marital conflict,

603
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:54,472
but if you can get your mom
and your dad on board,

604
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:57,016
I'd still very much like
to make this deal happen.

605
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:57,934
Me too.

606
00:32:58,017 --> 00:32:59,894
Um… I guess I just don't…

607
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:03,690
I still don't understand what happened.
I need more context, so…

608
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:05,274
Call your mom.

609
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:07,986
And let me know if we can forge ahead.
I'll stand by.

610
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:10,863
Thank you, Cane, for calling.

611
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:21,833
[ominous music playing]

612
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:23,251
Can I help you?

613
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,335
You're in luck.

614
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,878
Grady wants to meet.

615
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,798
My car's outside. I'll take you.

616
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:33,011
I'll follow.

617
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:42,603
[gritty music playing]

618
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:39,911
[man] There he is.

619
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:44,123
There he is, Mr. Harlan Buckley.

620
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:47,001
Thank you for making it all the way here.
I know it's quite a trip.

621
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,921
Sorry, I'm a hugger.

622
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:56,052
You want a drink?
Let's drink. Drinks? Thanks.

623
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:58,387
So, I wanna know everything about you.

624
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:02,517
I mean, I googled, obviously,
but I wanna know what's not on Google.

625
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:05,561
-Please.
-Well, I don't know what you know.

626
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:08,397
Well, I guess I know the basics.

627
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,108
Your father played a significant role

628
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,693
in the Cali Cartel's descent
on the South in the late '80s.

629
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:15,238
Sorry. Uh, alleged role.

630
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:16,572
He died.

631
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:18,157
Uh, rest in peace.

632
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:20,076
Tortured to death by a man

633
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:23,121
who was then also found dead
from an apparent "suicide," wink-wink,

634
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:25,331
but your family was never indicted.

635
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:28,209
Excuse me, but I already know all of this.

636
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:31,212
Of course you do. What am I doing?
I'm fanboying out on you.

637
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:34,048
It's because you're the GOAT.
[chuckles] I'm not worthy.

638
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,258
Oh, thanks.

639
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:37,844
Here. You know what?
Take a little stroll with me.

640
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:38,970
Come on.

641
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:46,727
By the way, chef's kiss.

642
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:49,063
The way you smoked that sheriff?

643
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:52,233
And then immediately replacing him
with your cousin's husband?

644
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:55,570
Fucking baller move, dude.
[chuckles] Right?

645
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:58,447
I love it. You don't fuck around.

646
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:01,576
Your dad's probably like, uh,
thumbs up from the grave, right?

647
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:02,910
"You're killing it, son."

648
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:06,664
And correct me if I'm wrong.
You work with your son too.

649
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:08,499
See? I dig that.

650
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:09,750
Family man.

651
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:13,754
This used to belong to my grandparents.

652
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,382
They had it forever. Now it's mine.

653
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:19,552
So it's just you
at the helm of all of this?

654
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:21,220
You?

655
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,140
[chuckles]

656
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:25,183
Are you surprised?

657
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:28,352
Just… little old me.

658
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:32,940
I wanted to build something
that was… all mine, you know?

659
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,860
My… legacy, I guess.

660
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,737
Come here, let me show you.

661
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:44,160
[uneasy music playing]

662
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:46,913
[knocking on door]

663
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,667
[Jenna] So, what's up?

664
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:57,173
Uh, I just thought we could talk awhile.

665
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:03,387
How's he doing?

666
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:04,347
[sighs]

667
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,890
Who knows?

668
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:07,308
He just lays there.

669
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:09,560
Not awake but not asleep.

670
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:12,355
You?

671
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,982
How are you doing?

672
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:17,151
Work sucks.

673
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,362
No assignments.

674
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:22,865
I-- I haven't written a single thing
since I got out here,

675
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:27,036
and my marriage is dying
faster than my dad.

676
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:32,083
I'm no journalist, but I'm pretty sure
that's called burying the lede.

677
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:34,794
What happened?

678
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:36,462
Scott, uh…

679
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:42,468
Scott's all about work,
and if it gets too hard

680
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:45,805
or it interferes
with his train of thought,

681
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:47,473
he tunes it out.

682
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:50,977
So… I've been tuned out.

683
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:54,855
What about you?

684
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:57,692
Peyton left.

685
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:00,278
She took Savannah and went to her parents.

686
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:01,821
For a while.

687
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:03,864
A while?

688
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:07,201
Don't ask me what that means,
'cause I don't know.

689
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,666
But I don't think I could see you anymore.

690
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:17,420
Ah. [chuckles dryly]

691
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:20,589
And you've come to tell me that.

692
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:24,010
[gentle music playing]

693
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:26,387
Yeah.

694
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:32,518
I like that you stayed a good guy.

695
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:40,943
Don't.

696
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:51,746
See?

697
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:55,082
Still a good guy.

698
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:11,640
[door opens and closes]

699
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,686
[knocking]

700
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:20,358
You gotta look at this.

701
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:27,114
Troy Smith and Curtis Sutton drowned.

702
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:31,786
-I have to tell you something.
-Right? Then Hoyt Piper goes missing.

703
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:34,455
Marcus. Marcus, can you stop?

704
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:35,998
What?

705
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:38,250
I was wrong about my brother.

706
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:43,047
I looked in his computer, his files,
his e-mails, everything. There's nothing.

707
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:46,008
You saw Cane talk to Hoyt
about a drug run with Curtis and Troy.

708
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:48,177
I made a terrible mistake
bringing you here.

709
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:51,013
Sheriff Porter gets ironed out
by 4,000 pounds of metal…

710
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,014
Are you listening?

711
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:54,600
…and this investigation report
is a complete joke.

712
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:56,143
There's no autopsy.

713
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,145
His body, cremated.

714
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,648
Get this. Guess who finds it.

715
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,316
Your father.

716
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:06,112
No, my… my dad is not responsible.

717
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:09,240
No, no, no, Cane is.
Your father's just protecting him.

718
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:13,369
-No, no, you're wrong, Marcus.
-Yeah. Hey, I know it's a lot to digest.

719
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:15,913
-I'll help you.
-You can't build a case on lies.

720
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:17,748
-Babe, you have to stop!
-Hey.

721
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,792
I know it's hard to hear…

722
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:21,794
[breathing shakily]

723
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:23,629
…but you're gonna get through it.

724
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:25,214
It's gonna be okay.

725
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:28,426
[unsettling music playing]

726
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:35,516
Ta-da!

727
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:41,480
Welcome to my humble little opium startup.

728
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:43,941
We're stockpiling.

729
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,360
You produce this much opium?

730
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:50,114
We have a friend in Miami
who sends up large-scale orders,

731
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:52,616
but as an eager entrepreneur,

732
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,203
I'm building my own harvest to go solo.

733
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,538
Come here, check it out.

734
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:05,296
We're planting the poppies in the spring,
but first we've got to plant all the corn.

735
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:06,422
Corn?

736
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:11,427
Uh, yeah, the corn stalks hide it
from the satellites and the drones.

737
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:15,347
I bet a lot's changed
since your last foray into the biz, huh?

738
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:18,434
You didn't have to worry
about eyes in the sky,

739
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,769
electronic leashes.

740
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:24,565
The risks have multiplied,
so loyalty's even more important.

741
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,650
That's why I love
how you keep it in the fam.

742
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,235
I could learn a lot from you.

743
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:32,364
You know, Harlan, I've been looking
for someone I can depend on.

744
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,242
For a long time now.

745
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,787
-You can count on me.
-Yeah?

746
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:41,582
All I ask is,
you let me do what I do, my way.

747
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:44,585
And which way is that?

748
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:46,128
We use my guys.

749
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:48,756
I run two shipments a week.

750
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,758
Any more, the risk is too great.

751
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:53,427
We deal with each other directly.

752
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:57,306
You don't tell me how to do my job,
I don't tell you how to do yours.

753
00:41:58,766 --> 00:41:59,975
I…

754
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,354
Okay, yeah. You got it.

755
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:05,648
I should get going.

756
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:07,858
Oh, uh, just, uh, one more quick thing.

757
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:09,360
Stevie, come here.

758
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:11,237
Come on, man.

759
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:15,783
Now, Stevie here was saying something
behind your back before you got here.

760
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:16,992
What was it?

761
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,454
[tense music creeping in]

762
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:23,541
Come on, you had a whole song and dance.
Let him hear it.

763
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:25,000
Now?

764
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,085
Yeah.

765
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:27,670
Right now.

766
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,548
You can't trust a Buckley.

767
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:33,175
That-- that's just what Porter said.

768
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:36,011
Oh, come on, man. You gotta own it.

769
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,930
And there was more to it than that.

770
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,518
I should be the one
to take over for Porter.

771
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,854
[Grady huffs]

772
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,526
Wow, this is a little awkward. [chuckles]

773
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:54,071
Harlan, do you think
we need a middleman anymore?

774
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:55,155
No.

775
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:58,158
And Steve-o,
what did you want for your cut?

776
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,580
-Twenty-five percent.
-Yikes.

777
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:07,126
That would eat into your cut, right?
Think that's fair?

778
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:10,421
No.

779
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:14,883
Oh, there was one other thing
you said at the end. What was it?

780
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:18,470
What'd you say? You said this other
one little thing. What'd you say?

781
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,807
[softly] People should know
he killed Porter.

782
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:23,434
Man, you gotta speak up.

783
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:26,854
-We're right here. We can barely hear.
-People should know he killed Porter!

784
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:29,690
[Grady] How's that make you feel?

785
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:33,152
I told you I run a smooth operation here.
You can be honest.

786
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:36,655
Communication is…
just so important for that.

787
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:38,949
Want me to kill Stevie here?

788
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:41,118
[music turns menacing]

789
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:43,120
Because if not, I'm gonna let him go.

790
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:45,748
He could talk to the cops.
I don't know. It's your call.

791
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:50,461
Please. I was never gonna tell anyone.

792
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:55,507
Keep your mouth shut and work for me.

793
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:56,634
Ooh.

794
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:00,471
Yes. Whatever you say.

795
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:03,641
[menacing music builds]

796
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:04,767
Let him go.

797
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,393
Aww.

798
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:07,311
That's so nice.

799
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:11,065
Yeah. Go for it.

["Black Leaf" by The Cave Singers plays]

801
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:16,236
You tried. That's what's important.

802
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:18,822
[cries frantically]

803
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,366
This is gonna get loud.

809
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:37,800
Oh!

810
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:44,890
I'm not sure, but… I think you got him.

811
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:46,100
[laughs]

812
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:50,020
He's like…
[mimics exaggerated death throes]

813
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:53,357
[chuckling] It's a real trick
to miss with that thing.

814
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:57,152
Anyway, I got a really good feeling
about this, Harlan.

815
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:59,196
Let's have fun! All right?
