00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,624
[exhales]

181
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,418
…platter and no shrimp and calamari.

182
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:46,669
-Excuse me.
-Mm-hmm.

183
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,129
-Hey, hon.
-Hey.

184
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:51,882
-Got your text. What's going on with Dad?
-It was a false alarm.

185
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:55,469
-His defibrillator had a loose screw--
-What? How does that happen?

186
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:56,929
I have no idea.

187
00:09:57,013 --> 00:10:00,057
They're reprogramming it,
and he'll be fine per usual.

188
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,476
How about you get him
to put down the bottle, huh?

189
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,603
Oh, God.

190
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,855
So, what is happening with the Miss Glory?

191
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,691
It washed up on shore.

192
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,444
And Curtis and Troy?

193
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,780
You need to tell him.

194
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,533
Are you crazy?
What am I going to tell him?

195
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,494
"I did it, Dad.
It's the end of the almighty Buckleys."

196
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,204
Stop being so dramatic.

197
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,540
Just tell him the truth. All of it.

198
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,751
He's the one that stepped away.

199
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:30,296
He dropped this shit show in my lap
and he expects me to start printing money?

200
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,258
By the way,
have you spoken to your sister?

201
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,843
No, I'm not Bree's keeper.

202
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,386
She's been very nosy lately.

203
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,389
Do not tell her anything about this, okay?

204
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,601
-Keep it to yourself.
-She's the last person I want to talk to.

205
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:46,520
[crowd cheering]

206
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:54,528
[softly] Come on.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

207
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:58,240
[indistinct encouragement from crowd]

208
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,743
[cheering]

209
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:01,952
All right!

210
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:04,664
{\an8}[softly] Come on, now.

211
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:08,209
{\an8}-[woman] Keep going, keep going.
-Let's go.

212
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,507
-What are you doing here?
-Same as you, watching a relay race.

213
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,258
You need court permission to see your son.

214
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,761
It's almost over, Rodney.
There's ten minutes left.

215
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:22,181
-Are you gonna go or do I call 911?
-All right, fine.

216
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,266
I'm leaving.

217
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,643
[woman] Typical.

218
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:29,105
One more word, bitch,
and I will slap you off this bridge!

219
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,731
That was a direct threat, Bree.

220
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,942
Are you recording this?

221
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,820
Jesus, you're pathetic.

222
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,322
[Rodney] You need to go.

223
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,992
You're a small man, Rodney Hopkins.

224
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,330
[crowd cheering]

225
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,874
[gritty music playing]

226
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,507
[woman] Hey! Come here!

227
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,679
Hello, sir.

228
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,973
DEA Special Agent Marcus Sanchez.

229
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,057
Oh.

230
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:08,185
-He's here about the Miss Glory.
-All right. DEA, huh?

231
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,312
What can I do for you? Thanks, Bree.

232
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,480
I'll stay.

233
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,775
It's about your boat, sir.

234
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,528
Miss Glory? Well, that's not my boat.

235
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:20,531
I mean, it's registered to you.

236
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:23,325
Yeah, well, it was,
until I sold it to Curtis Sutton.

237
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,036
Uh, is he okay?
I know his boat washed up on the beach.

238
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,663
Curtis has yet to be located.

239
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,751
When did the sales transaction
for the boat take place?

240
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:35,504
Uh, I sold it to Curtis
in a cash deal back in June.

241
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,132
He'd been after me
for that boat for a while.

242
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:40,885
He said he wanted to be his own man,
not work for anyone.

243
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:43,095
You know,
control his own destiny kind of thing.

244
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:46,682
And, uh, may I ask why the DEA
is interested in the Miss Glory?

245
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,643
You can ask.
Thank you for your time, Mr. Buckley.

246
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:51,353
Ma'am.

247
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,438
[Bree] Bye.

248
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,944
-What in the hell was that?
-Huh?

249
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:03,699
Well, he's gonna find out you were lying.
Curtis doesn't own Miss Glory.

250
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,869
-He does. He bought it back in June.
-How come I didn't know?

251
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,371
-We have lanes around here, remember?
-Oh my God.

252
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,373
Fish house is my lane.
Get back to your lane.

253
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,876
-Oh, that's right. You don't have one.
-Eat shit.

254
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,302
-Cane, I need to talk to you.
-Can it wait, Tommy?

255
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:26,055
-No. I mean, we gotta discuss this.
-Yeah.

256
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,604
Oh! Jesus Christ!

257
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:35,105
What the hell have you done?

258
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,316
Jesus Christ, Dad.

259
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:40,986
I wouldn't bother getting up.

260
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,864
[panting]

261
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,908
I'm just gonna hit you again.

262
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:51,956
Okay, we've got domestic on the left,
imported on the right, uh…

263
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:55,125
-Thirty-two different brands.
-This place is amazing.

264
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,336
Where are you from, Shawn?

265
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,422
-I'm from Galveston, originally.
-Mm!

266
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,132
-Texas?
-Mm-hmm.

267
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:05,219
-What brings you to Havenport?
-I wanted a change.

268
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:09,098
-And I also have some family here.
-Married? Got a girl?

269
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:12,685
Hey. Sorry I'm late, Michelle.
I owe you one.

270
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:15,229
Oh, excuse me a moment, Shawn.

271
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:17,773
Hi, honey.

272
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,276
Where've you been?
Everything okay? I've been texting.

273
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,820
Running late is all.
Is that the new bartender?

274
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:25,656
Yeah, I've been showing him around.
Um, what's going on?

275
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:28,868
The DEA was here
asking questions about the Miss Glory.

276
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:32,580
I'm as clueless as you are.
Let's keep a lid on that for now, okay?

277
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:37,668
Okay. I was thinking today was a good day
that I could get back in the office.

278
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:41,171
-It's too soon for that.
-Cane is terrible with finances.

279
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,716
Right now, I need you to get
the new bartender up to speed,

280
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,801
and I need to go check on the kitchen.

281
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,345
-I should be running the office.
-Not now, Bree.

282
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,597
It's been a morning.

283
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:53,058
You signed over a $300,000 boat?

284
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:58,314
They're investigating.
I need the distance.

285
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,691
Who are you running drugs for?

286
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,485
It was one run, Dad.

287
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,570
Don't you lie!

288
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,655
Okay, it was three runs, that's all.

289
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:09,366
I'll deal with it.
I'll talk to Hoyt today.

290
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,995
Hoyt Piper? Dealing with that little shit?
Jesus almighty.

291
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,163
I was gonna tell you!

292
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,790
I thought it'd look better
once some of the debt was paid off.

293
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:20,294
-We are upside down right now.
-What happened on that boat?

294
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,712
Where's Curtis and Troy?

295
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:22,922
I don't know.

296
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,592
They haven't found them yet.
Maybe they're hiding.

297
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,636
Where? The bottom of the ocean?

298
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,179
No, I don't know.

299
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,056
[tense music playing]

300
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,975
Something went wrong.
They-- they could be okay.

301
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:36,894
How much was the haul?

302
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,147
Upwards of $10 million.

303
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,816
That'll get you about 20 years.

304
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,110
We are in trouble here, Dad.

305
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,989
We're two minutes from losing this place.
Do you understand that?

306
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,325
It was a few runs to get ahead.
That's all!

307
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,994
Who were Troy and Curtis meeting?

308
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:55,621
Hoyt does all that.

309
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:59,041
Jesus, son. You can't be this stupid.

310
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,501
I will talk to him.

311
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:02,086
Yes, you will.

312
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:05,381
And you tell that idiot you're done.

313
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,632
It's over.

314
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:08,842
You cut ties right now.

315
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,553
Do you understand?

316
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:21,105
You reach for that Johnnie Walker,
I will chop your hand off.

317
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,318
[sighing deeply]

318
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,408
-How are you feeling?
-Angry.

319
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,867
[pours water with bar gun]

320
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,745
How much trouble is Cane in?

321
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,250
We might want to call Billy Pruitt
and get him on retainer.

322
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,169
You know what Cane's up against.

323
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,589
Overfished waters,
environmental quotas, gas prices.

324
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,174
Do not defend him.

325
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,552
I will lose my shit if you defend him.

326
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:55,180
[softly] Okay.

327
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,270
[ice cubes clatter]

328
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:06,191
[grim, driving acoustic music playing]

329
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,665
[music fades]

330
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,422
Hey, what the hell, Hoyt?

331
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,340
Are you wired?

332
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,509
What? Wired? No, man.

333
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,804
-Do not point that thing at me.
-You need to take off your clothes.

334
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:39,224
Are you serious?

335
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,310
If you want to talk,
take off your clothes.

336
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,896
No, I'm not taking off my clothes.

337
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:47,941
Then you should go.

338
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,360
Did you see this in a movie?
Why would I be wired?

339
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:53,822
Shit's going down.
I ain't trusting nobody.

340
00:17:58,786 --> 00:17:59,787
Okay.

341
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,248
Unbelievable.

342
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:04,875
What happened to your face?

343
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,418
Don't worry about it.

344
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,090
Happy? There you go.

345
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:14,593
-You can leave your underwear on.
-Yeah, well, I'm not wearing any.

346
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:19,098
-God, why aren't you wearing underwear?
-Because… sometimes I don't.

347
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,017
[jeans land with a soft thud]

348
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,982
[Cane] What the hell happened, Hoyt?

349
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,693
-Hmm?
-[Hoyt] All I know is the boat was clean.

350
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,445
No drugs, no Curtis or Troy.

351
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,449
What about your brothers, huh?
How deep are they in this?

352
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,787
-[beer can cracks open]
-Not exactly self-starters, those three.

353
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,251
Look, man.

354
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,754
Owen thinks it was you.

355
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,382
-He thinks you're side-dealing.
-[Cane scoffs]

356
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,717
Why would I do this? Huh?

357
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,554
-$10 million worth of cocaine and opiates.
-Oh, come on.

358
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,597
-Do you need a better reason?
-Come on, man.

359
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:03,100
You know me.
Why would I do this? I wouldn't do this!

360
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:06,270
You've always been a little rich boy
thinking of ways to get richer.

361
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:09,731
Yeah, if that were true,
I wouldn't be working with you, would I?

362
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,024
You should go.

363
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,486
Hoyt, come on, man.

364
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:17,698
This could be real bad for both of us.

365
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,242
We're friends, you and me.

366
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:23,829
We need to help each other out.
You need to tell Owen I didn't do this.

367
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,583
Or better yet, I will tell him.
Is he here?

368
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,169
-I could square this away with him.
-He isn't here.

369
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,461
Then where is he?

370
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:35,757
What is the big secret around this guy?
Where can I find him?

371
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,259
I wouldn't worry.

372
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,594
Owen will find you.

373
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:45,100
-So you're the new bartender?
-Yes, sir. I'm Shawn.

374
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,978
I'll have a Johnnie Walker on ice.

375
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,980
-Uh…
-Something wrong?

376
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,817
Sir, I was told
not to serve you before 5:00.

377
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:55,986
Who told you that?

378
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,822
Your wife and daughter.

379
00:19:58,906 --> 00:19:59,823
Several times.

380
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,283
But I want a drink.

381
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:02,826
[chuckles]

382
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,703
Could you maybe come back at 5:00?

383
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,747
That's not the answer.

384
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,209
What does your gut tell you to do?

385
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,672
-[scoop rattles through ice]
-Thank you, Shawn.

386
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,050
Hey, Clyde.

387
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:21,053
-Want a drink with me?
-I'm on duty, Harlan.

388
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,889
Um… could we have a word?

389
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,392
The DEA is all over this.

390
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,520
They think Curtis and Troy were smuggling.

391
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:33,023
There's no way. I'd know if they were.

392
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:36,818
Would you? 'Cause you ain't really
been around since your heart troubles.

393
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,445
Doesn't Cane run things now?

394
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:41,406
I'm still breathing, Clyde.
I know everything that goes on here.

395
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,368
Oh, so you know
that Curtis owns the Miss Glory.

396
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,828
I do. Cane sold it to him some time ago.

397
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:50,123
Yeah, I was at the courthouse earlier.
I saw the paperwork.

398
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:53,919
Anything else?

399
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,506
Well, I'm sure the Feds
will figure it out soon enough.

400
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,260
If they're cracking down, they've got
informants and undercover agents

401
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,136
all up and down the East Coast.

That's a good thing, Clyde.

404

Yes, it is.

405
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,188
Afternoon, Harlan.

-[panting] No, I'm gonna pass out.

415
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:06,783
It's my first run in a while,
so I might die on you.

416
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:07,868
Well, don't do that.

418
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,038
What are you doing in town?

419
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:13,415
I'm just… here for a while.

420
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,167
Your dad?

421
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,128
Yeah, yeah, he's not doing so great.

422
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:22,049
Just here to, uh, help out at the store
and hang out with him.

423
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,842
I-- I heard about that. I'm sorry.

424
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:26,178
So, you still write
for the Atlanta paper, right?

425
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:27,637
Yeah.

426
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:30,307
Yeah, it's on Zoom now,
so I get to do it from here.

427
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,808
So you've been here a while?

428
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,643
About a month.

429
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:38,106
Yeah, Peyton didn't mention it?
We had lunch last week.

430
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,442
Must have slipped her mind.

431
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:42,861
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

432
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:44,446
Yeah…

433
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,531
It's-- it's good to see you.

434
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,203
Uh, okay, well, I gotta go.

435
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:53,747
Um… we should catch up soon.

436
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,707
You come by the bar for a drink.

437
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:56,833
Okay.

438
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,543

Cane came to me six months ago.

452
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:10,532
A hundred grand per trip.

453
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:14,786
Just a few runs to catch up.
That's all it was meant to be.

454
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:18,248
Who else besides Curtis and Troy
are in on it?

455
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:20,041
Tim and Reggie.

456
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:24,087

That's why you hired them? [scoffs]

We're gonna lose
the restaurants, the marina…

You had no right to go behind my back.

460

Behind your back?
We did it under your nose.

461
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:36,433
You were too busy
drinking and whoring around to notice.

Do not put this on me.

"Recovering"? Is that what jacked up
on Viagra and bourbon is called?

This was your best thinking?
Christ, where's your memory?!

466
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,738
-You know what happened.
-If you're hell-bent on dying, do it!

She told me.

00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,235
We texted this morning.

491
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:11,278
Oh.

I don't think he's got much time.

696
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,905
[Hoyt's screams echo in the distance]

697
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,118
Oh, excuse me.

698
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:03,536
[clears throat]

699
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:07,248
Hey, babe. I could have picked you up.

700
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,750
Dad dropped us off.
I need you to take us home.

701
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:10,960
Hi, Bree.

702
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:12,044
Hi, Miss Swanson.

703
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:15,089
You can call me Daphne.
I think we graduated to first names.

704
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,048
Mm-hmm.

705
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:18,176
I got us a table in the lounge.

706
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:20,261
[indistinct chatter]

707
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,849
[light jazz music
playing in the background]

708
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:31,981
Um, I'll just sit here.

709
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:33,274
Great.

710
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,652
I told you I wanted to go to a mall.

711
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,362
-I need new sneakers.
-You texted too late.

712
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:40,656
-I texted you.
-I didn't have time to file the paperwork.

713
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,991
Can this please be okay?

714
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:45,912
Diller, is that you?

715
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,414
Look at you growing by the second.

716
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:49,832
-Hi, honey.
-Hey, Grandma.

717
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,335
Mom, this is Ms. Swanson,
our court-appointed monitor.

718
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:55,087
-You can call me Daphne.
-Oh, hey, Daphne.

719
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:57,089
Isabelle Buckley, nice to meet you.

720
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,175
Uh, dinner's on us. Anything you want.

721
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:01,219
Mm!

722
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,598
[Bree clears her throat]

723
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,684
How'd you do on the relay?

724
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,019
We lost.

725
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,396
How's school?

726
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,857
Sucks donkey dick.

727
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,571
You dating any girls?

728
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:23,658
Boys?

729
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,869
[sarcastically] Mostly group sex.

730
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:27,995
Hmm.

731
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:31,207
How's Georgina?

732
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:32,750
She's awesome.

733
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:35,419
I mean, she even lets me call her Mommy.

734
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,881
Well, aren't you
a delightful little prick?

735
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:49,183
[ominous music playing]

736
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:58,067
It's in the shed.

[ominous music rising]

[engine stops]

739
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:16,043
[Harlan] So what was the plan, Hoyt?

740
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:18,045
Who's behind this?

741
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,422
I know it ain't you.

742
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:23,759
Some man from Jersey offered a better cut.
They're sending a truck for it.

743
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:27,054
[Harlan] Looks like you made a mess
with a whole bunch of people.

744
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,514
What's the code?

745
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:32,768

[uneasy music playing]

[music rising]

750
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:51,078
Boy, this is some tight security
you got here, Hoyt.

751
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,542
[loud siren bursts in]

752
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:57,626
[Cane] Oh, shit.

00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,919
[siren blares]

754
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:00,755
Let me do the talking.

{\an8}[ominous music playing]

756
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:16,562
Evening, fellas.

757
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,106
Clyde.

758
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,192
This is a bit odd.

759
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:26,238
-What am I looking at here, Harlan?
-Maybe you should ask Hoyt.

760
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:28,574
They are dealing drugs.
They double-crossed their supplier.

761
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:31,535
-He's lying, Clyde.
-[Hoyt] I'm not. They kidnapped me.

762
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,662
Look, my hands are tied.

763
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:38,376
[whispers] I haven't told them anything.

764
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:41,128
Thank you, Hoyt.

765
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,588
I appreciate it.

[Canes exhales]

771
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,518
I guess that would make you Owen.

772
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:59,897
Oh, my son's firstborn is named Owen.
I just always liked the name.

773
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:03,317
-Guess I didn't know that.
-No, you wouldn't.

[panting]

775
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:06,695
So tell me, Clyde Owen,

776
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:09,281
how do we reconcile tonight?

777
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:12,243
Well, we've reached
a turning point here, Harlan.

778
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:15,204
-I don't know what that means.
-It means it's late, Cane.

779
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:16,789
We can go home. It's all good.

780

You know,
I always looked up to you, Harlan.

781

We're friends.

-Always have been.
-[Clyde] You would see it that way.

783

You're friends to everyone.

784
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:34,974
I mean, it helps coming
from that big house you grew up in.

785
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:40,062
Yeah, the mighty Buckleys of Havenport
now owe me.

So, yeah. Yeah, we're good.

788
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:48,821
You know, my pipeline has sprung a leak.

789
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:53,075
And I need to fill it.

790
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:58,664
Now, I know you're used
to being the boss man.

We'll… sort out the rest of it later.

You can deal with Hoyt.

What now, huh?

841
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:10,170
We let the alligators do the rest.

842
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,506
What about the sheriff?

843
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:15,301
He's another problem. I'll han--

00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:32,776
Do not apologize.

852

Jesus, what's wrong with you?

853
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:37,990
-You don't hit a man and then apologize.
-Stop, please, stop.

854
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:40,701
You let the hit sink in
and come back the next day--

00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,759
You drink too much.

859
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,887
-It's going to kill me.
-Yeah, well, hurry it up.

You did good tonight, son.

862
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:10,689
I'm impressed.

863
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:13,525
Why? Because I hit you?

864
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:14,943
No.

865
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:18,364
I never thought you'd touch a dead body.

866
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:21,033
You proved me wrong.

867
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:32,503

The house looks new.

873
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:09,998
The perk of burning down a house
