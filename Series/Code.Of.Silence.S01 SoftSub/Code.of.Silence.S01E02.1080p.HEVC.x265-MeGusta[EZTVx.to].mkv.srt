1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,296
Detective looked for
you on the breakfast shift.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,936
This is detective inspector marsh.

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,960
James. James.

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,616
I-I can do it if you tell me what it is.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,936
'We're all watching a gang
who are planning a robbery.'

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,936
they're careful to meet in
places where we can't bug them.

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,936
That's why we need a lip-reader, so
we can understand what's being said.

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:21,937
Who is that?

9
00:00:21,961 --> 00:00:24,936
No idea. Liam.

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,960
Liam Barlow, 29.

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,936
'Look, these people are dangerous.
You don't wanna get close to them.'

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,936
'the tap is a pub, right? And
they put Liam in a flat nearby.'

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,136
I could see a lot more
if you just get me closer.

14
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,960
You really, really need to
leave the investigating to us.

15
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,480
Are you, like, a regular here? No,
just moved in around the corner.

16
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,960
Tyres screech Alison?!

17
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,960
There. What's that?
What did he say there?

18
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,960
Muffled conversation

19
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,800
speech muted

20
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,136
missing this. What is this? Yeah.

21
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,800
Sorry.

22
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,960
He didn't turn up for a meeting.

23
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,960
And he's asking Cruella to reschedule it.

24
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,000
Why? Why did he not
turn up for the meeting?

25
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,936
I-I don't know. It's not clear. Radio beeps

26
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,936
'6-0-1.' what's he doing?

27
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,960
Hoodie is taking items
out of the carrier bag.

28
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,240
Saying something like "phone".

29
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,960
And "switching".

30
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,960
And the driver's not
really happy about that.

31
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,936
Driver's phone just went off.

32
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,960
What? Wh-what happened?
They're switching the sim cards.

33
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,936
So you've been getting the
messages from the driver. Shit!

34
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,960
Yeah, we were
intercepting his messages.

35
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,000
Radio beeps all units, stand down.

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,960
Phone buzzes muffled chatter.

37
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,960
You should get to your shift.

38
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,936
But... if you can't read
their phone messages,

39
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,936
then you're not gonna know
when they're gonna meet.

40
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,936
So... what you gonna do?

41
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,960
We'll find another way. Thanks, Alison.

42
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,936
'Yeah, pull up the recordings, will you?'

43
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,936
right. There. Now,
who's...? Ok, so, hoodie.

44
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,936
'Hoodie's not gonna give us anything.

45
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,936
'I mean, why would he? So
we need something, anything.

46
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,936
'Agreed? Anything that
vaguely resembles a lead.'

47
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,960
I'm sorry. Sorry.

48
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,936
Liam's new to the gang, isn't he? Yeah.

49
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,936
'So he could be our way
in. What do we think?'

50
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,937
"phone buzzes

51
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:24,936
'ok, they're gonna reschedule
this meeting, aren't they?

52
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,776
'So we need to find a
way to be there, yeah?'

53
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,960
'yeah.'

54
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,960
and we stay focused on Liam.

55
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,960
Antony, mate?

56
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,936
Everything ok? Yeah.

57
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,296
You... you have been changing
your sim card once every three days,

58
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,936
like we told you?

59
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,936
Yeah, course I have, bray.

60
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,960
It's just Liam thinks
we're weak on security.

61
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,936
I've been doing everything
you told me to, bray.

62
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:10,456
Did you... or did you not
follow the rules we gave you?

63
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,616
Sarah doesn't like
me changing numbers.

64
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,000
She's nearly nine months.
She could drop any day.

65
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,136
Sarah.

66
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,160
Antony groans.

67
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,960
Antony groans.

68
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,960
Machine beeps.

69
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,960
Hi.

70
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,960
Hi.

71
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,960
I, er... didn't know
you'd be working today.

72
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,960
Is this a bad time?

73
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,936
I'm... I'm fine. Can we talk later?

74
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,960
No, I... I just... I was
hoping to see Braden.

75
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,960
Yeah, later's good.

76
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,960
Sorry. She chuckles
I didn't see you there.

77
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,000
You are...? I'm Alison. I work here.

78
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,800
Alison, this is Braden. Our owner.

79
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,960
Hiring anyone these days. I'll take that.

80
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,936
Just stay out of his way, you know?

81
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,960
He chuckles

82
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,960
hum of conversation.

83
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,960
Glass clinking

84
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,160
hello. Hey.

85
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,936
I... just wanted to see how you are.

86
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,960
Yeah, I'm fine...

87
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,936
The owner, Braden, do you know him?

88
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,960
He put in a word in
for me for this new job.

89
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,936
The guy you were
speaking to, is that your...?

90
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,320
Yeah, he's my ex. Yeah.

91
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,296
I got major bad vibes.

92
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,480
She chuckles I'm sorry, I
didn't mean to be so rude.

93
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,960
It's ok.

94
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,936
When you two were, like,
signing, it made me think,

95
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,936
that's how it must be for you all the time.

96
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,936
Around, you know, people who can hear.

97
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,960
Yeah. It... It can be like that sometimes.

98
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,000
I was wondering...

99
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,960
Do you wanna come
out for a drink sometime?

100
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,936
Chuckles nervously yeah.

101
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,936
Er, yeah, maybe.

102
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,936
Er, thank you for taking me to
hospital and for driving me home.

103
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,040
You didn't have to do that.

104
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,640
Yeah, I did. I knocked you off your bike.

105
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,960
I better go back to work.

106
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,480
See you later. Door opens

107
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,800
door closes.

108
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,320
Hairdryer whirrs.

109
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,960
Mum!

110
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,960
Sighs.

111
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,800
Thank you.

112
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,960
Yeah. Yeah, I'll give you that.

113
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,960
Ok. Yeah, I'll see you then.
I've gotta go. All right. Bye.

114
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,936
Alison. Is everything all right?

115
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,616
Yeah. Have you got a minute?

116
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,320
Yeah. Yeah, come... come this way.

117
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,936
'What's up?'

118
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,960
who was James talking to?

119
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,616
Er... James is with the
assistant chief constable.

120
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,936
He's trying to get more
funding for surveillance.

121
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,960
But we'd never be able to
watch them around the clock, so...

122
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:40,296
So you need someone closer
to them, like an informant.

123
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,960
Yeah, but that's easier said than done.

124
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,960
But I've been

125
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:52,640
I've been doing some bar
work, and it's near Liam's flat.

126
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,960
Have you been working
at the canterbury tap?

127
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,200
Have you made contact
with Liam Barlow?

128
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,960
Er... Have a think.

129
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I believe you've been working at the tap.

130
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,936
I... I went in cos I just wanted
to see if he was there, and...

131
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,936
But they needed the staff,
and I just really need a job.

132
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,937
I mean, of all the places

133
00:15:25,961 --> 00:15:28,480
Braden Moore owns
the tap. You know that?

134
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,960
Yeah, I... I know.

135
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,960
Was that the only time you
made contact with them both?

136
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,960
At the bar.

137
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,960
It's a simple question. Just have a think.

138
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,960
That was the only time?

139
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,960
Wh-what?

140
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,296
Ben has been tracing Liam's movements

141
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,936
over the last couple of days,

142
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:05,936
and it seems Liam made a
surprise trip to the hospital

143
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,960
night before last.

144
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,936
It was an accident, and
he knocked me off my bike.

145
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,960
And then he drove you to the hospital?

146
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,936
Well, I think he was just worried.

147
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,616
He just didn't want me
calling the police, so...

148
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,936
You were the reason why
Liam didn't go to that meeting.

149
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,960
It was you.

150
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,960
You've risked the
entire fucking operation.

151
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,936
I'm sorry, but...

152
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,936
You wouldn't have known
anything if it wasn't for me.

153
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,936
You were paid, Alison. You
only paid me minimum wage, so

154
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,936
I should arrest you for misconduct.

155
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,936
But I could actually help!

156
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,936
You know, Liam and Braden,
they're actually meeting.

157
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,776
I saw them talking.

158
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,616
And the meeting's back on.

159
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,936
I don't want your help.

160
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,456
I don't want anything from you.

161
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,936
It is not safe for you to be
anywhere near this station.

162
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,936
You're a security risk.

163
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,480
Ashleigh, tell the canteen
we're letting Alison go, yeah?

164
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,160
I had to push James to use you.

165
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,960
This looks bad on me,
too. No, I know. I'm sorry.

166
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,960
Am I gonna get paid?

167
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,960
Don't push your luck.

168
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,936
May I...? I should explain to Gary, then.

169
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,960
I'll talk to Gary. Max, could you...?

170
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,960
If you could just come
this way? This way.

171
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,960
Hi.

172
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,960
So, did you fix my bike?

173
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,936
Yeah, yeah.

174
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,936
You need your wheels for work,
and the crash was my fault too.

175
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,640
Your mum offered me a cup of tea.

176
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,960
Thank you. That's very nice.

177
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,960
We've been chatting.

178
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,960
Chatting?

179
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,937
About what?

180
00:18:55,961 --> 00:18:57,800
You, mainly.

181
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,960
Me?

182
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,960
Sorry, she's just winding me up...

183
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,960
Shall we go outside?

184
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,936
'You made a big impression on my mum.'

185
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,936
I like her. She's cool.
Seriously, thank you.

186
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,936
I didn't know how I was
gonna get my bike fixed.

187
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,080
It was a little bit selfish.

188
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,640
See, I was hoping that maybe
you'd have that drink with me.

189
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,937
Maybe. If you ask again.

190
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:31,960
He chuckles

191
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,976
can I take you to
London tomorrow night?

192
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,960
I'm meeting some friends, and I
thought maybe you could come along.

193
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,640
Ok. Yeah.

194
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,960
Tomorrow. Tomorrow.

195
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,936
Well, the acc was charmingly
blunt in his assessment of our case.

196
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,640
We are not getting
any more surveillance.

197
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,936
Liam Barlow. Any news on him?

198
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,936
He's been working as
a software developer.

199
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,937
Yeah? He's moved around.

200
00:20:16,961 --> 00:20:19,936
Previous addresses in
London and Manchester.

201
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,937
Couple of parking tickets.

202
00:20:20,961 --> 00:20:23,480
'To be honest, I'm not getting much.'

203
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,936
people don't usually evade
your levels of research skills.

204
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,936
'Without access to their messages,
we need another way in, don't we?

205
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,960
'So keep looking.'

206
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,160
Have you got two phones?

207
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,000
He chuckles softly one's for work.

208
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,160
What do you do?

209
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,936
I am a software engineer.

210
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,000
Who do you work for?

211
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:04,936
I am doing some... digital security
work for a local businesswoman.

212
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,936
But she made me sign an nda,

213
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,936
so I shouldn't really be talking about it.

214
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,960
Well, that sounds more
interesting than pulling a pint.

215
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,960
It's not, believe me.

216
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,936
So, where exactly are
we meeting your friends?

217
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,936
They are going to a
bar down by the river.

218
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,960
We'll drop in and see
them, take it from there? Ok.

219
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,960
Ok.

220
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,936
Animated chatter, music plays

221
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,936
can I squeeze through, is that ok?

222
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,960
Thank you. There we go.

223
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,936
Oof, busy! What do you want?

224
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,960
Can I have a vodka, lime and
soda? Yeah, yeah, no worries.

225
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,640
Hiya.

226
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,960
Chatter and music muffled.

227
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,960
Phone buzzes.

228
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,480
Dance music blares

229
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,960
faint chatter

230
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,480
chatter and music muffled.

231
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,936
This is my fiancee, Maya. Hey!

232
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,936
Hi. Liam. Hey. Nice to meet you.

233
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,976
Er, this... this is Alison. Hey!

234
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,976
This is Sammy and Maya. Hi.

235
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,960
Hi! It's lovely to meet you.
Lovely to meet you, too.

236
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,456
Are you engaged? Yeah.

237
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,960
When are you getting married?
Don't ask. It's not for ages.

238
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,960
Back in a second.

239
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,936
Have you met Liam before?

240
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,776
No. We just met.

241
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,160
Sammy wanted to come here.
Said we might run into a friend.

242
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,776
So, how did you and Sammy meet?

243
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:33,936
Well, I'm a dental nurse.
He just kept... Speech fades

244
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,320
conversation muted

245
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,936
eventually, I was like, "are
you gonna ask me out or what?"

246
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,936
That's very cute. Yes.

247
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,976
So, what does he do for work?

248
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,296
He works for a security
storage company.

249
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,936
They look after valuable
things for very rich people.

250
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,936
Whereabouts is he based?

251
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,936
They've got buildings all over.

252
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,936
Sammy's mostly based in
Mayfair. He's quite junior.

253
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,960
Low hum of chatter and music

254
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,976
very cute.

255
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,936
It's not a real diamond, but I don't mind.

256
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,936
You know, Sammy keeps saying
he's gonna get me a real one,

257
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,936
like he'll get a big pay rise or something.

258
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,960
Hey. We should get
going. But we just got here.

259
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,800
What, you're going now?

260
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,960
We'll go somewhere else.
Maya scoffs one more drink.

261
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,960
Four! Four... Dance music blares

262
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,936
want me to get some
more? Yeah, definitely.

263
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,120
Should go get more, for sure.

264
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,960
Yeah. Machine beeps

265
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,960
get four more? Four.

266
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,960
Cheers! Whoo!

267
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,616
Well, you definitely cannot drive. I know.

268
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,936
I'm back in town tomorrow,
so I'll grab the car then.

269
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,936
Let's get a taxi. But how
much is that gonna cost?

270
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,960
Don't worry, I'm paying...

271
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,936
Are you hungry? Am I what?

272
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,936
Are you... are you hungry? Hungry?

273
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,936
Yeah. Yeah, I'm hungry.

274
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,960
I am. Come on. I know a place.

275
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,936
Do you know what, I used
to come to London a lot

276
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,936
when I was little with my dad.

277
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,936
He used to take me to the flower market.

278
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,800
It was different back then.

279
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,456
Actually, it was the only time

280
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,936
I remember going anywhere
on my own with him.

281
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,937
Yeah, he was away a lot.

282
00:26:57,961 --> 00:27:00,936
It was mostly was just
me and mum, growing up.

283
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,960
He doesn't live with you now?

284
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,936
Thank you. What did you say?

285
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,000
Your dad, he doesn't live with you now?

286
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,296
He went off wandering.
Is... is he deaf too?

287
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,960
No. My mum is deaf,
but my dad is hearing.

288
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,960
Are things tough without him? Tough?

289
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,456
Yeah, my mum's been made redundant,

290
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,960
so financially, it's a bit difficult.

291
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,456
And my dad just didn't really deal with it.

292
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,936
Or, actually, he just didn't want to.

293
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,456
I was let go, two jobs. Two jobs.

294
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,960
So, yeah, things are a little bit tough.

295
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,936
So, what do you wanna
do? What's your dream?

296
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,960
Dream?

297
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,936
Do you know what, I used to be
really good at gymnastics at school.

298
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,936
Really? I actually thought
I could win a gold medal.

299
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,937
She chuckles

300
00:27:58,961 --> 00:28:00,936
but I need a bit more
realistic dream than that.

301
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,936
No, no, no, don't do
that. Don't be realistic.

302
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,936
What... you're not realistic?

303
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,480
Definitely not. No way.

304
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,960
So what is your unrealistic plan? Mine?

305
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,960
You know...

306
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,936
This place does the
best sticky toffee pudding.

307
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,936
Sticky toffee pudding?

308
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,480
Ok.

309
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,960
Er, sticky toffee pudding, please.

310
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,800
Thanks.

311
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,640
You left it open.

312
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,320
You could lose anything in it.

313
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,320
Thanks.

314
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,320
Hey, that looks nice.

315
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,960
Could you see what I was saying
when I was talking to Sammy?

316
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,960
Not much, no.

317
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,960
You seemed to be
asking a lot of questions.

318
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,960
I have to pay attention, otherwise
I'd never know what's going on.

319
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,960
So you're always
watching? It's like a habit?

320
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,296
Well... yeah. Why?

321
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,960
What, you got something to hide?

322
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,960
He chuckles

323
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,960
I'll have to keep my eye on you.

324
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,960
I had a good night.

325
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,160
Really good. Yeah. It was good.

326
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,320
I... I can see you again, right?

327
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,960
To be honest, it's complicated.

328
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,960
"Complicated".

329
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,960
With your ex?

330
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,960
Just complicated.

331
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,960
I should go.

332
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,960
I'll text you.

333
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,936
We were so clear to you about
the dangers of getting involved.

334
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,936
Yeah, but I didn't tell him
I was lip-reading for you.

335
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,936
I didn't tell him anything. Yeah

336
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,960
I've got information.

337
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,936
Liam met up with a guy called Sammy.

338
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,936
I think he works for a
high-security storage company.

339
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,936
I didn't get his last name,

340
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,136
but I think Liam brought me
along to keep his girlfriend busy.

341
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,936
They talked about Mayfair.

342
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,936
I think, Sammy showed
something to Liam.

343
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,936
I think it was a floor plan.

344
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,960
They talked about a
family vault in a basement.

345
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,937
Family - what family?

346
00:32:52,961 --> 00:32:58,936
I don't know, but Sammy's fiancee
thinks he's coming into some money.

347
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,960
I think they're paying him for information.

348
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,936
What do you want?

349
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,936
What do I want? Yeah.

350
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,960
Well, I want to help.

351
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,936
They're not suspicious of me.

352
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,960
They underestimate me.

353
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,960
Most people do.

354
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,976
We can't risk you being seen
here while you're working at the tap,

355
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,960
but, yes, your information
backs up what we know.

356
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,936
We're checking the description of
Sammy against employees of vaults

357
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,936
and high-net-worth
storage facilities in Mayfair.

358
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,960
It's allowed us to
narrow down our search.

359
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,776
You understand how dangerous this is?

360
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,640
Becoming an informant.
Dangerous? Yeah.

361
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,456
And you're already working at the bar,

362
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,936
and you have no intention of leaving.

363
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,936
Correct? Correct.

364
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,960
I mean...

365
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,936
If you happen to see
anything related to this case

366
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,320
while you are working at that bar.

367
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,936
I would really appreciate
it if you would let me know.

368
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,000
Ok?

369
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,936
Alison, for your safety,
we'll set up protocols,

370
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,960
and I'll be your contact, ok?

371
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,936
But just so we're clear,
I am not asking you

372
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,936
to put yourself in any
danger to get this information.

373
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,936
Ok? Do not go out of your
way to watch these people.

374
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,960
Yeah, yeah. No, I understand.

375
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,456
You can end up with a
lot of regrets in this job.

376
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,800
Alison, I don't want
you to be one of mine.

377
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,960
For us to foster that digital awareness.

378
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,936
I can tell by some of your faces

379
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,936
that it's time for me to shut
up so we can go for lunch.

380
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,960
Thanks for listening.

381
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,960
Ben, any news on venues?

382
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,936
Working with Alison's information,

383
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,976
we've narrowed it down to three
high-security storage facilities

384
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,960
and vaults that use biometrics.

385
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,136
'But I can't find out more
about specific security systems,

386
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,936
'as the facilities are
understandably reluctant

387
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,200
'to give out that information.'

388
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,976
Nia, you were looking at
the driver, Antony bates?

389
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,936
Anpr shows he's been
checking out warehouse space.

390
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,936
'Warehouse space?'

391
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,960
ok. Maybe using this as a rehearsal
space if they're looking at vaults.

392
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,360
'We need to get three down to one.'

393
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,936
good morning. I have an appointment.

394
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,776
Your credentials, if I may?

395
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,960
Passport, and letter of
recommendation from my bank.

396
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,320
Thank you, mr standford.

397
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,936
I need a box. Doesn't need to be big.

398
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,937
Just absolutely bulletproof.

399
00:37:55,961 --> 00:37:57,000
Follow me, sir.

400
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,936
I'm told you're the best.

401
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,936
We have all the usual safeguards

402
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,936
motion sensors, weight-sensitive vaults

403
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,960
and a few innovations of our own.

404
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,160
Glad to hear it.

405
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,960
Retina scanner. Still the most
secure biometric safeguard.

406
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,960
Indistinct chatter, machine beeps.

407
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:34,960
That'll be 5.60. Machine
beeps customers chatter.

408
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,000
Cobweb.

409
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,960
Do you want another one? Later, yeah.

410
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,960
Door opens, closes

411
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,936
hey. Hi.

412
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,960
How's it going?

413
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,936
Terrible.

414
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:28,936
I met this girl, we went
out, had a really nice time,

415
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,960
but then she didn't reply to my texts.

416
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,960
Sorry. I've just been really busy.

417
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,960
Yeah. Me too.

418
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,936
Well, I'm sorry, I just
turned all the taps off.

419
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,960
I, er, come to see Braden.
I can get him for you.

420
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,480
You go. I'll lock up.

421
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,960
I will text you.

422
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,960
Ok.

423
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,960
What are you doing? What?

424
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,936
You were texting... And
then you looked at the monitor.

425
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,936
I didn't know if I should
turn the screen off.

426
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,960
Mark didn't say. Whoa,
whoa, whoa. What's goin' on?

427
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,960
Who were you texting?

428
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,936
I wasn't texting.

429
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,960
You know her? Yeah. I...

430
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:40,960
How well do you know her?

431
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,960
Give me your phone. What?

432
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,960
No. I didn't do anything. Open it.

433
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,960
It's from earlier. There's nothing since.

434
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,936
You should get going.

435
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,960
Go.

436
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,936
Alison, it's my responsibility
to keep you safe,

437
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,960
and if you're not gonna play by
the rules, this isn't gonna work.

438
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:14,456
This meeting is significant.
What are they planning?

439
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,776
To second chances?

440
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,936
This is way beyond anything
we could've asked for.

441
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,240
This is... brilliant. Thank you.

442
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:24,640
You're in this now, and I'm
gonna tell you how we do things.

443
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,800
