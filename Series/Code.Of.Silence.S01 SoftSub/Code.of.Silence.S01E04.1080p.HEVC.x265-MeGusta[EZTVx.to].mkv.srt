1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,936
The gang's last robbery was a jeweller's.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:04,937
Innocent member of the public got shot.

3
00:00:04,961 --> 00:00:06,456
Door whirring

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,936
how did you find out that
they're meeting at the ice rink?

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,960
Well, I saw a text on Liam's phone.

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,960
'Do you talk a lot with Liam?'

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,936
yeah. Because how else
can I get close to him?

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,936
Anything you can get on that
woman there in the Navy blazer.

9
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,960
She's chandra baskhi. She works
for the steel millionaire Amir joshi.

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,936
I'm getting you through the tech.
Those are nothing to do with me.

11
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,296
You're in this now.

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,960
There is something about
this I don't feel comfortable with.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,936
We don't wanna park too close.

14
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,960
Please be careful around Liam.

15
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,640
Seat belt clicks

16
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,640
Alison, spit it out.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,960
Ok. If we...

18
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,936
If you got Liam on, er, conspiracy...

19
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,960
Conspiracy, yeah.

20
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,960
How long would he be looking at?

21
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,936
Put it this way - if you help us get him,

22
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,960
before they go in with guns,
then he... he might have a life.

23
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,960
Right. Ok.

24
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,936
Alison, if you have feelings
for this guy, there's...

25
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,936
You... No, Liam likes me.

26
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,936
I'm just playing along.
Yeah. There's a fine line...

27
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,960
Look, I know what I'm doing.

28
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,960
Knock on door, keyboard clacking

29
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,160
he exhales

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,640
so...

31
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,800
One kiss, and then you just ran away?

32
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,960
He sighs.

33
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,960
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,960
He chuckles softly do you wanna...?

35
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,936
I, er... I've been away a
couple of days, that's all.

36
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,960
Visiting a mate.

37
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,936
And moving to a new place?

38
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,960
Er, yeah. Braden
needed his old place back.

39
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,960
So just like that? Yeah, it was urgent.

40
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,960
Is this all about your job?

41
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,960
Are you trying to protect me from...
Whatever it is that you're doing?

42
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,320
I can't tell you anything more.

43
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,960
And I completely understand
if that's not enough for you.

44
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,960
Ok.

45
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,960
No more questions.

46
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,937
Except one more.

47
00:03:56,961 --> 00:03:59,000
Chuckles softly

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,960
are people gonna get hurt?

49
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,960
Look, I know what sort of
guy Braden is, but brains.

50
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,976
Trumps brawn.

51
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,800
Always.

52
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,320
I wanna see you again.

53
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,480
I wanna see you every
day, if you'll let me.

54
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,800
But I can't tell you what I'm doing.

55
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,936
Ben, walk us through what we know.

56
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,936
Ok. Chandra baskhi. Oversees
transport for Amir joshi.

57
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,936
Could've been chandra who
alerted the gang to the jewels.

58
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,936
And we have a confirmed location
on where the jewels are right now?

59
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,976
Yeah. The family have an account
with croesus international vaults.

60
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,936
Their London branch is in Mayfair.

61
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,936
And we've finally found
the mysterious "Sammy".

62
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,936
Genius used his credit card at the bar.

63
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,936
Sammy Turner, software engineer at...

64
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,936
Croesus international.

65
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,616
And we've contacted the
company or the auctioneers?

66
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,936
No, we don't wanna spook anyone,
but the auctioneers have confirmed

67
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,936
the jewels are going on sale in five days.

68
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,976
Which is promising, but the
gang stopped communicating.

69
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,456
You're not getting around
weight-sensitive vaults

70
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,936
without some kind of rehearsal.

71
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,936
Yeah, exactly. So
where are they practising?

72
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,936
Because unless we gather
evidence for a conspiracy charge,

73
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,936
we've got to move in on them at
the vault, and then we risk bodies.

74
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,936
So... James sighs

75
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,936
let's keep all eyes and ears
open. Let's look at lock-ups.

76
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,616
Let's find out where
they're working from,

77
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,936
where they're keeping their weapons.

78
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,456
Let's dig. Quietly.

79
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,960
Dogs barking.

80
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,960
Footsteps descending.

81
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,960
Door opens door closes.

82
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,296
Thanks. Cheers.

83
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,960
Door opens.

84
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,960
What can I get for you?

85
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,960
You're a friend of Liam's.

86
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,960
Yeah.

87
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,937
How did you...?

88
00:07:46,961 --> 00:07:49,960
I'm Helen. He must've mentioned me.

89
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,136
I learned not to ask.

90
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,960
Good.

91
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,936
Liam's asked to take you on a work trip.

92
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,960
As I'll be paying, I thought I'd
better get a proper look at you.

93
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,936
And...?

94
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,960
Where did you work before the tap?

95
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,000
At the orchard house cafe.

96
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,936
Have you been? No.

97
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,960
Liquid pouring.

98
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,160
Liam says that you live with your mum.

99
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,936
Yeah. No dad around?

100
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,960
Bottle cap unscrewing he left.

101
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,000
Is that everything?

102
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,960
Yeah.

103
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,960
I reckon so.

104
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,960
Are we going away?

105
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,976
At the tap, a woman came by,
and she said that she was your boss.

106
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,936
Really?

107
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,960
She gave me a right grilling.

108
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,960
I'm sorry.

109
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,960
So, where is Helen taking us?

110
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,960
Fancy hotel.

111
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,480
Separate rooms, obviously.

112
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,296
So, Liam has invited me away.

113
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,960
Overnight?

114
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,960
A day trip.

115
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,936
Is it mostly work, or is it mostly fun?

116
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,960
Healthy mix... I hope.

117
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,320
So...?

118
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,960
I need to find something to wear.

119
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,960
'London again?'

120
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,936
he didn't say. Must've
said something. I mean

121
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,616
I mean, did he tell you
what the trip was for?

122
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,616
Sorry I'm late. Traffic was awful.

123
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,296
Liam is talking to Alison again.

124
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,936
He did tell me...

125
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,960
That he has a plan to make
sure no-one gets hurt on this job.

126
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,136
So he's starting to trust you.

127
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,960
I suppose he must.

128
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,936
Ok.

129
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,456
Thoughts, ash?

130
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,456
Yeah, I think you should
go. I think she should go.

131
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,616
Ok. Anything you can get
from Liam, anything... Yeah.

132
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,960
Could be essential.

133
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,960
Wow.

134
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,960
Thanks.

135
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,960
Thank you.

136
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,640
He exhales, chuckles.

137
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,936
I was worried that
you'd change your mind.

138
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,136
I nearly did.

139
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,936
But then I haven't been
to a five-star hotel before,

140
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,960
and I'm about to become homeless, so...

141
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,296
He sighs

142
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,960
how about we leave Liam
and Alison at home today?

143
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,936
Yeah, that's fine by me.

144
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,936
Good. Because when
we get to the front desk,

145
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,936
they'll call me by another name.

146
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,960
Just play along, yeah?

147
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,000
Ok.

148
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,160
She chuckles softly, engine starts

149
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,960
engine revs.

150
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,936
Sir?

151
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,936
We found out where the joshi
family are staying in London.

152
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,936
Good. Mayfair regency hotel.

153
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,936
It's just down the road
from the auctioneers.

154
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,936
Great. We heard from Alison?

155
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,960
No, not yet. Ok.

156
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,936
Guv, can I ask you a question?

157
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,936
Why so obsessed with the
rookie when it's Helen's op?

158
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,000
Because he's not a rookie.

159
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,936
I mean, skills like his, you
hone them. Takes years.

160
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,936
So... who is he?

161
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,937
What's his link to the gang?

162
00:12:52,961 --> 00:12:55,936
Why's he suddenly taken
Danny Heath's position?

163
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,936
And why is it we don't
know anything about this lad

164
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,640
from before five years ago?

165
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,960
Guests chatter

166
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,936
welcome.

167
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,960
Thank you.

168
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,960
Bags in the back. Thank
you. Sure. No problem.

169
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,776
A room under "Jack standford", please.

170
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,936
Of course.

171
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,776
Welcome to the hawthorne
estate hotel, mr and mrs standford.

172
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,960
They chuckle softly

173
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,936
not sure how I feel
about taking your name.

174
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,936
Who says I didn't take yours?

175
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,937
Your lucky day, sir.

176
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:58,936
Looks like management's
upgraded you to the Milton suite.

177
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,937
Really?

178
00:13:59,961 --> 00:14:02,776
Amazing. Thank you. Can
I show you to your room?

179
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,320
No, no. I think we'll manage. Yeah?

180
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,960
Liam chuckles softly

181
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,960
clock chimes.

182
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,936
It really was our lucky day.

183
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,960
No. That was the day that you
got yourself a hacker for a husband.

184
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,936
Wait, you did this?

185
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,936
Yeah. I had to get in and bump us up.

186
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,960
The suite's only room with two beds...

187
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,960
She chuckles softly

188
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,960
ok. Yeah.

189
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,000
He chuckles

190
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,936
so, what's the plan?

191
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,936
Taking you to dinner.

192
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:17,296
Hotel's restaurant.
Tiny portions, big bill.

193
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,936
You ever been to a place
like that? No. Have you?

194
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,960
Yeah, care home took us every week

195
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,960
come here.

196
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,960
Liam exhales.

197
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,936
I probably got this all wrong.
I... I tried to keep it simple.

198
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,936
No obligation to wear it.

199
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,960
It's perfect.

200
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,776
But that's, what, two months' rent?

201
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,936
Only the best for mrs standford.

202
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:03,960
Liam, I... I-I can't accept that. Why not?

203
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,936
I'm getting a big pay-out soon.

204
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,960
Who better to spend it on?

205
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,960
So what you're doing, it's soon?

206
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,960
Phone buzzes.

207
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,960
Footsteps approach

208
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,937
wow.

209
00:16:47,961 --> 00:16:49,776
Thank you. He chuckles

210
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,936
wait, do I have time to have a bath?

211
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,936
Course. I need a bit of time to
get some work done, anyway. So...

212
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,936
Downstairs at seven, yeah?

213
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,960
Don't stand me up this time.

214
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,960
No.

215
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,040
Looking for the spa, madam?

216
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,960
Chuckles softly

217
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,960
'nocturnes, op. 9' by chop in he exhales.

218
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,960
He gasps softly.

219
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,480
She chuckles softly

220
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,936
do I look the part?

221
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,000
More than.

222
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,960
Can I just hold you there
for a moment, please?

223
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,936
Good evening. Nice to see you again, sir.

224
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,960
It's good to be back.

225
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,241
We've taken the Liberty of
preparing some welcome drinks.

226
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,960
Diners chatter.

227
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,936
The maitre'd has arranged
the private dining room for you.

228
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,937
Fine.

229
00:19:13,961 --> 00:19:15,800
Muffled conversation.

230
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:38,960
So, can you tell me... What
she is saying to him right now?

231
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,960
It's probably not that
interesting. Let's find out.

232
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,960
Muffled chatter.

233
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,000
I think they might be
talking about their grandson.

234
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,936
She chuckles ok.

235
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,936
He just said, "I'm not changing
the nappies for anyone."

236
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,936
Liam laughs charming both chuckle

237
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,960
yeah, she thinks so, too.

238
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,937
How do you do it?

239
00:20:21,961 --> 00:20:25,296
If you don't mind me
asking. How do I do it?

240
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,936
Well, you just watch very carefully.

241
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,936
You sort of imagine the sound
coming out of their mouth.

242
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,960
But it's also all the other stuff, too.

243
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,960
So hard work, then?

244
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,456
Yeah. It's like... it's like a
great big puzzle, you know?

245
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,936
You're piecing things together.

246
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,936
And you've got body language, too.

247
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,960
Like, I'd, like... You lean
forward to ask a question.

248
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,776
Or you lean back cos
you're kind of a bit pissed off.

249
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,960
He chuckles

250
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,937
it's a proper talent, that.

251
00:21:00,961 --> 00:21:04,936
He chuckles well, you've
got one too, haven't you?

252
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,960
Yeah.

253
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,960
How did you get into hacking?

254
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,640
No laptop in the home. Obviously.

255
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,960
So I'd go and use this
old PC in the library.

256
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,936
Ended up on these hacking
forums. Made a bit of mischief.

257
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,936
So you didn't go stealing the
pensioners' money, have you?

258
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,937
Cos that's a bit of a red flag.

259
00:21:32,961 --> 00:21:35,936
Dunno. Those two have it coming.

260
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,960
Both chuckle

261
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,936
so, how did you get from that to...?

262
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,960
This?

263
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,616
I was doing some coding
work in London last year. Legit.

264
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,976
Legit? Pay, not great.

265
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,960
But I had this boss, Danny.

266
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,776
He was in with Helen and that lot.

267
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,936
Inhales sharply

268
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,960
but he couldn't do this
job, so... He put me up for it.

269
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,936
What, he put you up for it?

270
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,960
He sort of... had to quit.

271
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,960
So...

272
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:24,960
Have you never been tempted
to bend the rules a little bit?

273
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,800
Like your dad? My dad?

274
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,800
How do you...?

275
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,480
Helen made me do a
little bit of background.

276
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,960
Well, then...

277
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,640
You probably know my dad's
been breaking the rules all his life.

278
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,960
Yeah. Didn't get him very far.

279
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,480
And I knew that was not the path for me.

280
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,960
Sorry.

281
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,936
Did you have any foster
families that you really like?

282
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,960
There was one couple. They
really put up with all my shit.

283
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,936
We were happy families for a bit.

284
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,136
For a bit?

285
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,936
What happened?

286
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,936
Turned 18. Moved out.

287
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,800
He died.

288
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,936
His wife gave me this, actually.

289
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,960
Really?

290
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,800
It belonged to him.

291
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,960
I'm really sorry. Don't be.

292
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,776
Do you ever... see your foster mum?

293
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,960
Yeah. Well, I try to.

294
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,640
Door closes thank you.

295
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:16,456
Am I going mad, or is this
tidier than when we left?

296
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,936
He chuckles two cleans a day.

297
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,960
The rich are just that filthy.

298
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,960
Night.

299
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,976
Well, it'll be a shame
to mess up two beds.

300
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,800
Wouldn't it?

301
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,320
Speech muted.

302
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,960
I've been wearing them all my life.

303
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,960
I feel a bit naked not wearing them.

304
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,936
When you're with people who can sign,

305
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,160
it's quite freeing, not needing to wear it.

306
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,320
You must miss that.

307
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,960
Being with someone
who knows what it's like.

308
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,960
Yeah. I... I guess so.

309
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,960
Give me time. I'm sure I can learn bsl.

310
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,960
So, after your job.

311
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,936
Do you get to go back to your old life?

312
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,000
No.

313
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,320
Guess that's the point.

314
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,937
Ok, see you later.

315
00:28:10,961 --> 00:28:13,936
Ok, took some leaning
on the Mayfair regency

316
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,937
to bend their discretion policy,

317
00:28:14,961 --> 00:28:17,296
but they told me that the
joshi family are out of town now.

318
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,936
She sighs what about the jewels?

319
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,936
The auction house are continuing
with the sale. Nothing's changed.

320
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,937
Ok. There's more.

321
00:28:22,961 --> 00:28:24,976
The vault wouldn't divulge
anything about the joshis' deposit.

322
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,936
However, when I pushed them
and sent them an image of Liam,

323
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,936
they did confirm he had
visited the vault last week,

324
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,160
under the name... "Jack standford".

325
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,936
Alison causing headaches again?

326
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,936
You're always so hard on her.

327
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,960
Don't think I don't know why.

328
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,937
She told you, then.

329
00:28:48,961 --> 00:28:50,296
She didn't have to.

330
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,960
Look, me and Sara, it's not just some...

331
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,960
It's the real deal.

332
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,480
My ex left me for "the real deal".

333
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,936
They split a year later. Funny.

334
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,936
She chuckles I'm sorry.
It's not any of my business.

335
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,960
No. It's not.

336
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:12,160
Alison... I'm right, aren't I?

337
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,936
Yeah. Totally off-grid. Radio silence.

338
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,960
Then we need to run a
trace, for her own safety.

339
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,960
Phone buzzes.

340
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,936
Chuckles awkwardly how
about brunch in the bar?

341
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,296
Mum's trying to video-call me.

342
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,936
I... I think she's really
worried about the eviction.

343
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,960
I'll meet you down there. Ok.

344
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,936
Door opens, closes

345
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,960
thank you so much.
You're very welcome.

346
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,937
A hotel?

347
00:31:03,961 --> 00:31:05,936
Why didn't you tell us?
Well, you wouldn't let me go.

348
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,936
Alison, you cannot just disappear.

349
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,936
You... you can't ignore my messages.

350
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,936
The more you text me,
the more exposed I get.

351
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,936
Do you know, me meeting
you is a massive risk right now.

352
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,296
I know. Yeah, I get that.

353
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,936
But if you don't reply to
me, then obviously, I worry.

354
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,456
Liam has a really nice smile,

355
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,080
but it doesn't mean he's not a criminal.

356
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,936
Liam was watching
some people in the hotel.

357
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,960
I saw them. Yeah, I'm
pretty sure it's the joshis.

358
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,960
This is Amir joshi. Did you see him?

359
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,936
Yeah, I saw him. Last night.

360
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,936
Ok.

361
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,936
So, joshi's trying to buy a place
for his daughter in Knightsbridge.

362
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,976
He's... Inhales deeply

363
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,976
he's trying to teach her
a lesson in prudence,

364
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,936
so he's selling her favourite
necklace to pay for it.

365
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,456
So Liam must be here
to spy on him. Yeah.

366
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,960
He hacked into the hotel's cctv.

367
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,200
Well, let's hope he's not watching you.

368
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,320
I don't think... Alison... Phone buzzes

369
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,640
is that him?

370
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,936
Alison, I don't... no, no, I
don't feel right about this.

371
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,936
I'm gonna have to call James. Just let...

372
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,937
No. No. I'm gonna have to go. I just

373
00:32:18,961 --> 00:32:20,936
I really hope you're not doing anything

374
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,937
that would make this difficult.

375
00:32:21,961 --> 00:32:24,960
I'm doing exactly as you asked.

376
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,960
Phone camera clicking.

377
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,960
Papa? Come here. Light's better.

378
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,960
Hi.

379
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,960
Where have you been?

380
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,960
Well, mum was really
upset about her eviction.

381
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,960
What?

382
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,320
You have your alone time, so do I.

383
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,936
Thank you.

384
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,000
It's a bit early for that.

385
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,960
Shall we play our game again?

386
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,960
Ok.

387
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,960
Who shall we spy on, then?

388
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,320
How about Princess over there?

389
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,960
Indistinct chatter.

390
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,936
She really loves the spa.

391
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:00,456
But... she really wanted the suite,
and she's asking him for an upgrade.

392
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,960
Beat her to it, didn't I?

393
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,960
Muffled chatter

394
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,936
body language says she's
not happy. Phone ringing

395
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,960
that one's easy.

396
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,480
Ok. What's he saying now?

397
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,936
Bidding.

398
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,960
Something about bidding.

399
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,936
He said it has to reach 5 million,

400
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,320
or he'll pull the item.

401
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,960
She's not happy that he's selling it.

402
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,960
She really is not happy. Liam chuckles.

403
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:58,976
A pistachio Mac... A pistachio...

404
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,616
Macaron? Yeah, that's it, she said.

405
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,936
He asked for two boxes
to be sent up to her asap.

406
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,960
Wonder she's not spoilt

407
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,960
are you watching them?

408
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,936
Is there a reason?

409
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,936
Look at them.

410
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,960
Think they'd even notice
if they lost something?

411
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:42,960
He exhales that was... special.

412
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,960
Yeah. It was.

413
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,960
But...?

414
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,960
I just... I wish you weren't
doing whatever you're doing.

415
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,936
I wish I could live
in that hotel forever...

416
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,160
And just forget the rest, like, all of it.

417
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,960
Me too.

418
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,960
Yeah.

419
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,776
Liam must have known the
joshis were at the hotel, yeah?

420
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,960
He's tracking them.

421
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,936
So you saw Liam watching
Amir and his daughter, reshmi?

422
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,936
Yeah. Liam asked me to lip-read them.

423
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,937
'I saw them talking about bidding.

424
00:37:00,961 --> 00:37:02,936
'I think they were talking
about the necklace.'

425
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,936
'he probably wanted to check
they're going ahead with the auction.'

426
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,936
'do you think Liam was harvesting
pass codes from the joshis?'

427
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,936
like clone their devices, maybe?

428
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,296
Well, I did see Liam do
something on his laptop

429
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,936
when they was in the bar.

430
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,960
'He could've connected to their phones.'

431
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,936
it would explain how they hope
to get past the vault's safeguards.

432
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,976
Exactly. Did Liam mention
anything about his past?

433
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,936
Well, he did mention a guy called Danny.

434
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,936
And Danny was his old boss at
this coding company in London.

435
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,936
And Danny used to work for Helen.

436
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,936
But then he had to quit,
so he put Liam up for a job.

437
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,936
That's brilliant. Brilliant.
Ok. Get onto the met.

438
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,936
Get them to give you any intel
that they can on Danny's old case.

439
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,936
You get anything
else? Anything else? No.

440
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,616
No, not much, no.

441
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,936
Ok. That's great. Come
on, I'll give you a lift.

442
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,480
See you later.

443
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,960
Seat belt clicks Alison.

444
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,480
I never asked you to stay
in a hotel room with Liam.

445
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,936
No.

446
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,936
You didn't. But you did
ask me to get information.

447
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,960
You didn't really think of
where that might lead to.

448
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,456
I think I... I think I've become so hung up

449
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,936
on putting these bastards
away, you know, that, er...

450
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,960
That's on me.

451
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,936
But whatever you've started
with Liam, I need it to stop.

452
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,960
Please.

453
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,960
Yeah, ok.

454
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,936
So, all that damage to
my credit card's borne fruit?

455
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,936
Confirmed everything chandra told us.

456
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,960
Got everything we need
for our new approach.

457
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,960
Course you're happy. It's
all about you now, innit?

458
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,640
So what? Your cut's the same.

459
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,640
When are you collecting the piece?

460
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,456
Tonight.

461
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,960
Speak then.

462
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,960
Marky-Mark, the girl in?

463
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,640
Alison? Er... No. No, she's
not working today, bray.

464
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,960
You ever wonder what she's
up to when she's not here?

465
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,936
What you getting at?

466
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,936
I don't trust her.

467
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,960
I ran background on her. She's clean.

468
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,936
Right.

469
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,960
I'm really starting to regret
letting you in on this job.

470
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,936
First...

471
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:51,136
You shit your pants so
badly about my little toy

472
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,960
that we had to relocate you.

473
00:39:54,160 --> 00:40:00,960
Now your throb-on for that girl
is starving your brain of oxygen.

474
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,000
Well, this job... It's my ticket out.

475
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:13,320
Nothing is gonna fuck that up for me.

476
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,960
Especially not some girl
that I'm passing the time with.

477
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,640
Understand?

478
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:50,960
Phone buzzes.

479
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:00,937
'Liam?'

480
00:42:00,961 --> 00:42:03,960
I think... we need to talk.

481
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,960
Me first. Please?

482
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,960
What's this?

483
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,960
This is what we're taking.

484
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:44,937
Wait, is this from the family

485
00:42:44,961 --> 00:42:47,296
that you were sitting
next to at the hotel bar?

486
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:50,800
That's right. I had to
do some recon on them.

487
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,960
I need you to keep it
secret until we're done.

488
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:02,640
We're gonna take it from an
ultra-secure vault in London.

489
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,936
Replace it with a replica.

490
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,960
No-one will even
notice until it's too late.

491
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,960
And I... I swear to you.

492
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:22,776
No-one will be hurt.

493
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,936
How am I supposed to believe that?

494
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,960
You have to trust me on that.

495
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,320
Is that enough?

496
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:38,960
He exhales.

497
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,960
She chuckles.

498
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,936
I'm sorry... You nearly finished it.

499
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,960
But if you don't like Brazil.

500
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,800
We can go anywhere you like.

501
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,040
And not just for one night.

502
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:29,976
Forever.

503
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,936
I'm trusting you because I
want you to go away with me.

504
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,320
You're asking me to...? Alison.

505
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,960
In 48 hours, I am gonna have.

506
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,960
A lot of money.

507
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,960
But I'm gonna have to leave the country.

508
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,960
And I want you and your mum.

509
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,936
To come with me.

510
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,936
What? You want us to go...?

511
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,480
Look at them at the top.

512
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,296
They've got houses on every continent,

513
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,960
and you don't get to keep your home?

514
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,960
You deserve a real life.

515
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:14,480
I don't know.

516
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,960
What to say.

517
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:20,960
Say yes.

518
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,936
You cannot see Liam
again. He's dangerous.

519
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:36,296
If you walk into that vault,
you're gonna get caught.

520
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,976
I know that. How do you know that?

521
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,936
'It's just way too risky.'

522
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,776
unlocking now. Go on through.

523
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:43,936
She needs to stay out of this.

524
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:44,937
Go, go!

525
00:45:44,961 --> 00:45:46,616
You'll appreciate it's important

526
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,960
for us to understand the
events that led up to today.

527
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:50,960
Now.

528
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,000
