1
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,936
Spill. Have they shagged yet?

2
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,936
Yeah. I think so. No!

3
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,936
And he wants her to leave her husband

4
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,936
and just go away with him.

5
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,936
What, leave everything?

6
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,160
I would shag Gary
if it'd get me out of this place.

7
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,936
Would you?!

8
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,936
No!

9
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,000
Of course not!

10
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,936
But anywhere is better than this place.

11
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,936
When you two
have finished gossiping, Jayne,

12
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,480
need you on the tills.

13
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,936
Detective was looking for you
on the breakfast shift.

14
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,960
For me?

15
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,960
Why?

16
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,936
Hi... Hey. Can I help you?

17
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm here for DS Francis?

18
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,960
Over there.

19
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,776
Hi. I'm Alison Brooks.

20
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,936
Apparently, you were asking for me?

21
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,936
Yeah, I was. Alison, yeah.
Thank you for coming up.

22
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,936
I got your name
from the Community Skills Database.

23
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,936
You signed up when you started
working for the canteen.

24
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,936
You read lips, right? Yeah.

25
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,936
Good. OK. All of our usual
lip-readers are busy on other jobs.

26
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,960
One sec.

27
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,937
Hello.

28
00:04:46,961 --> 00:04:48,936
This is Alison.
Alison works in the canteen.

29
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,936
She's a lip-reader.

30
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,936
This is Detective Inspector Marsh.
James.

31
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,936
- James.
- James, hi.

32
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,640
And this is DC Lawford. Ben. Hello.

33
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,936
So, you lip-read?
Did you have lessons, or...?

34
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,936
I just picked it up.

35
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,936
And how much of a conversation
can you read?

36
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,936
Well, it depends.
You know, some people are easy.

37
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,936
It depends on the situation.
OK. Can we just have one moment?

38
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,360
Is that all right? Have a sit-down.

39
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,960
Sir, all our usual terps
are tied up on other jobs.

40
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,800
I-I can do it if you tell me what it is.

41
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,936
OK. That was impressive.

42
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,960
OK... She got that.

43
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,936
Well, we're all watching
a gang who are planning a robbery.

44
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,936
A big robbery.

45
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,936
And we have reason to believe
they're meeting tomorrow,

46
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,936
but they're always careful to meet
in places where we can't bug them.

47
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,936
That's why we need a lip-reader,

48
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,936
so we can understand what's being said.

49
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,936
Exactly.

50
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,936
Well, with lip-reading,
it's not just about seeing words.

51
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,936
It's who's talking
and what you know of them,

52
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,296
cos you kind of need context.

53
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,456
But we've also got to be
very careful about what we tell you,

54
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,936
for your own protection.

55
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,937
Alison

56
00:06:27,961 --> 00:06:29,936
do you need an interpreter
or anything like that?

57
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,936
Well, I don't have one now.

58
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,616
You can't talk about anything
that we've spoken about today.

59
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,936
No, OK.

60
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,936
You need to check me out.

61
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,936
Make sure you all can trust me?

62
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,160
We'll let you know.
DS Francis will be in touch.

63
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,160
Hi!

64
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,936
You're on tonight? What?

65
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,200
Why aren't those in the fridge?
Well, I'll take them now.

66
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,936
Can I get a non-alcoholic beer?

67
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,296
Non-alcoholic beer?
You would like some beer?

68
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,936
Non-alcoholic beer?

69
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,960
Non-alcoholic beer? OK. I'll get you that.

70
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,936
Good. I've negotiated an extra hour,

71
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,616
which means we now have surveillance
until 11:30.

72
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,936
And then the team
is due on a job in Dover,

73
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,976
which gives us a fighting chance

74
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,936
to figure out what Helen Redman
is cooking up this time.

75
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,937
We picked up another text.

76
00:08:53,961 --> 00:08:56,936
The meeting place is a picnic bench
on the south side of the park.

77
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,936
Alison, come through.

78
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,136
Went to three numbers.

79
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,936
One unknown,
one we think is Braden Moore,

80
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,936
and the other, you'll like this -
Joseph Holhurst.

81
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,936
Christ, really? Yeah.

82
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,936
OK, so Helen's getting
the old gang back together.

83
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,936
Well, minus Rob Byron, I guess.
Isn't Danny Heath still inside?

84
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,936
For the ransomware attack
on the insurance firm.

85
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,936
He's got eight months.
OK. So Helen's recruiting.

86
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,936
Alison. Hey. Hey.

87
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,936
Hey. You all right?

88
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,720
Nice to see you. You all right?
Come through.

89
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,616
This gang that we're watching,

90
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,936
they target jewellery stores, workshops.

91
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,616
Not afraid to use violence.

92
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,936
We can't arrest them
until we have enough evidence

93
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,936
to secure a conviction, but that's

94
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,936
like trying to do a jigsaw
without the picture on the box.

95
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,616
And, what, you want me
to find that piece of the jigsaw?

96
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,936
Exactly. You know,
we're doing what we can.

97
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,936
We've got the live feeds, we're...
I need to see you.

98
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,976
OK. Sorry.

99
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,936
We have surveillance teams in the park,

100
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,776
and we're watching the live feeds
whenever we can.

101
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,936
But today, we need you to just sit
and watch the monitors

102
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,640
and tell us what you see. OK?

103
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,640
Alison. Hi.

104
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,960
These are the people
we'll be watching, OK?

105
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,296
We call her Cruella.

106
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,936
We call him Hulk.

107
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,936
And that's Wolf.

108
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,936
What, like a code name? Yeah.

109
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,296
We need you to tell us
if you know any of these people.

110
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,936
No. No?

111
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,960
Here we go. Here we go. Nia?
Have a seat.

112
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,640
OK.

113
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,960
'Someone's approaching
the rendezvous.'

114
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,960
Unknown IC1 male,
grey jeans, brown hoodie.

115
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,936
Who is that? No idea.

116
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,960
'Awaiting orders. Shall I move him on?'

117
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,937
Nia, anything?

118
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:11,936
Not yet. Nothing.

119
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,960
He looks really nervous.
Like he's waiting for someone.

120
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,936
Hold on. Ben, he might be part of this.

121
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,960
Hulk's here.

122
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,960
New contact with Cruella.
Entering east gate.

123
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,960
'Contact with Wolf, central path.'
Full house.

124
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,936
Nia, do we have an ID
on the IC1 male in the brown hoodie?

125
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,936
Not yet. OK, keep trying.

126
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,936
There's not much to go on.

127
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,160
I'm looking back through the messages.

128
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,936
OK, what about this one?
What about this one?

129
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,936
What can you see there?

130
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,960
Here, anything you can see.

131
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,937
Anything at all.

132
00:12:02,961 --> 00:12:04,960
James, just give her...

133
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,936
Liam. Liam?

134
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,937
That's his name. His name's Liam.

135
00:12:17,961 --> 00:12:20,960
Nia, check for any associates
of the gang called Liam.

136
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,296
If we play the surveillance feeds back,

137
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,936
are you OK to try again?

138
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,776
To get any information
we might have missed.

139
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,960
So, if I play this back...

140
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,960
Right. Anything you can get from this.

141
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,936
Wait. Can you just go back a bit?
Yeah, well, if I...

142
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,960
Well, here. You do it. OK.

143
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,960
She's introducing man in a hoodie
to Wolf.

144
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,936
He said his last name. I missed it before.

145
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,936
So, Hoodie says his name's Liam.

146
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,936
And then I think his second name
is something like

147
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,936
like Barlow or Marlow.

148
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,936
But P and a B and an M,
they all look the same.

149
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,160
OK. What else?
Keep watching. What else?

150
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,936
Hulk said,

151
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,960
"I think he can help us."

152
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,960
Yeah. So, Hoodie is telling Wolf
about himself.

153
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,936
He's not from Canterbury.

154
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,936
He's moved around a lot.

155
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,936
Yeah, it's like it's
some sort of interview.

156
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,936
Liam Barlow, 29.
No previous convictions.

157
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,936
I have an address in Manchester, but...

158
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,296
They found him. Yeah.

159
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,960
OK, I need a full profile on him.
As quick as you can, yeah?

160
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,937
Very good work today.

161
00:14:07,961 --> 00:14:09,960
Very, very good.

162
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,936
You need to fill in this form
if you wanna be paid.

163
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,936
OK. Alison? Alison?

164
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,936
Very important
that you don't look up anything

165
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,936
that you've seen in this office today, OK?

166
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,960
For your own safety.

167
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,960
OK. OK.

168
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,776
'Fantastic, well done, John.

169
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,296
'He knows his sport, this lad, doesn't he?

170
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,960
'So, Christine, over to you...'

171
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,936
Today, the footage is from CCTV,
so it won't be as good quality,

172
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,936
but we need a date and location
for the robbery.

173
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,937
Morning, Sir. How are we doing?

174
00:15:42,961 --> 00:15:44,936
Good. Do you wanna roll the tapes?

175
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,160
Sir.

176
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,960
Anything?

177
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,937
No, it's not really clear.

178
00:15:52,961 --> 00:15:55,936
I can barely see the face. OK.

179
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,960
Well, you use this,
and you take as long as you need.

180
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,960
What's she saying? Here.
What's she saying?

181
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,936
Cruella is saying something

182
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,296
about Belmarsh?

183
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,936
Is someone in prison there?

184
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,936
Yeah. We know. Yeah. What else?

185
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,960
Keep looking.

186
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,936
I think she's saying a date.
Let me go back a bit.

187
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,960
Actually...

188
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,936
Actually two dates, 7th and 17th.

189
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,936
Could it be 7th or 17th? Alternate dates?

190
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,936
7th AND 17th. 7th and...

191
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,976
Maybe the robbery might happen
between those dates.

192
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,936
I mean, it's very hard to see, but...

193
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,960
She says "big, risky".

194
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,976
"Keep an eye on him."

195
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,960
What's he saying here?
This guy, what's he saying there?

196
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,936
"Putting him in a flat..."

197
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,936
Putting him in a flat.

198
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,960
Good. Near the app.

199
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,936
Could it be The Tap?
It's the name of a pub.

200
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,936
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it could be "tap".

201
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,800
- Are they talking about Hoodie?
- Ashleigh.

202
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,960
Shit. Sorry, I'm gonna have to go.

203
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,960
What?

204
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,320
Load of nonsense...

205
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,296
Excuse me. Hello. What is happening?

206
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,960
Our landlord's selling our estate
to this management company.

207
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,000
Sorry, does that mean
our rent's gonna go up?

208
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,960
Someone's got to pay
for her expensive suits.

209
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,960
No, no, no, no.

210
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,936
We've got intel

211
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,936
that the gang are meeting
in a bar not far from here.

212
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,936
We can watch on my tablet.

213
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,936
Saves us going to the station.

214
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,616
How do you know
they're gonna meet at the bar?

215
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,936
Someone got lazy.
We're monitoring their messages.

216
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,937
But that's why we need to be quick,

217
00:19:46,961 --> 00:19:49,616
because they could change
their passwords at any time.

218
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,936
Yeah.

219
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,960
They're having technical problems
with the camera.

220
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,936
Would you be up for going into the bar?

221
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,960
Into the bar?
We'd just be friends having a drink.

222
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,936
We won't get too close to them.

223
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,936
OK. Yeah?

224
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,936
But you're buying. OK.

225
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,616
Wolf, Hulk and Hoodie
are at a table to the left.

226
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,936
On the left?
Yeah. Our team will be in there.

227
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,616
And we can just take their place
as they leave. OK.

228
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,936
I'm just gonna talk to you
like we're friends,

229
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,976
and you can just ignore me,
and you watch them, OK?

230
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,960
OK. You ready? OK.

231
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,320
What do you want?
Can I have an Aperol spritz, please?

232
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,800
Two Aperol spritz, please. Thank you.

233
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,960
Thank you.

234
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,960
OK. We gotta go.

235
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:30,936
OK, I'm just gonna... chat,
while you get what you can.

236
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,936
Take your time. OK? Yeah.

237
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,960
Wolf is here.

238
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,960
Are you OK?

239
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,936
I need to get closer.
The angle's really bad.

240
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,976
It's too dangerous.
Keep trying from here.

241
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,960
You'll not get everything straight away.

242
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,936
Are you OK?

243
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,960
I can't see anything from here. OK.

244
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,976
Drink up. Why?

245
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,136
What are you...? Wait!

246
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,000
Alison!

247
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,480
Hi. Can I have an Aperol spritz?
On her tab. Thank you.

248
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,960
Can I get some napkins?

249
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,800
Jesus Christ.

250
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,936
'You shouldn't have got so close.
They could've seen you.'

251
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,936
'Do you wanna know what I saw?'

252
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,296
'What did you see?'

253
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,960
This isn't about the jewellery shop.

254
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,937
Yeah, I think they were talking

255
00:24:14,961 --> 00:24:17,936
about something like metric

256
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,936
like a bio-metric...

257
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,936
'Biometrics? Are you sure?'

258
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,960
'I can't think what else it can be.
It's such a clear shape.'

259
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,616
'Biometrics?

260
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,936
'That sounds like
they're going for a vault.

261
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,936
'That is a step up for this gang.'

262
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,960
'Hoodie thinks he can break in.

263
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,616
'I think he's a computer hacker.'

264
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,936
Did you see anything else

265
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,936
about the venue?

266
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,936
No. I think Hoodie needs something.

267
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,936
I don't know what,

268
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,480
but I think Cruella
is gonna get him information.

269
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,136
'You did well. You got loads this time.'

270
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,936
'It's so much easier
when you're in the room with them.'

271
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,937
'These people are dangerous.

272
00:25:01,961 --> 00:25:03,960
'You don't want to get close to them.'

273
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,960
Can I get you something?

274
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,960
No, thanks.

275
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,136
Alison. Hi.

276
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,456
We should, er... It's a live feed today.

277
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,320
See you. See you around.

278
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,936
'They're meeting in the play area.'

279
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,936
What, you got that
from the phone messages?

280
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,937
How do you know about that?

281
00:27:39,961 --> 00:27:42,960
I saw you say something about phones.

282
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,937
Thank you.

283
00:27:45,961 --> 00:27:48,936
We're looking for
a potential high-security facility.

284
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,936
Somewhere that uses biometrics,

285
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,936
which is new territory for this gang.

286
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,456
Did you find out
what they're planning to steal?

287
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,960
Look, just stick to lip-reading.
Leave the detection to us.

288
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,320
Contact with Hulk.

289
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,960
Cruella, south side with Driver.

290
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,960
That's a shit angle, isn't it?

291
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,320
'And we have Wolf.'

292
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,936
Hoodie's joining the party.

293
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,960
OK, we've got them,
we just need to see them.

294
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,936
I can't see anything. She...

295
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,616
Can I get... Can I get closer?

296
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,936
You can't? Nothing at all?
You can't see anything?

297
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,136
I can't lip-read the back of a head.
They won't like anyone closer.

298
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,616
Bad idea.

299
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,296
Just get a little bit closer.
She's got a point.

300
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,616
They're right there
talking about it. Right there.

301
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,936
OK. Ask her to move in.

302
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,000
7-0-6, move closer, with caution.

303
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,936
OK. No.

304
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,960
Er, this isn't gonna work, is it?

305
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,936
Shit. Yeah. This isn't gonna work.

306
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,936
Fuck's sake. Great. OK.

307
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,936
Stand her down. Yeah? Yeah.

308
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,936
7-0-6, stand down. All units, stand down.

309
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,976
They were right there talking about it.

310
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,976
They were right under our noses.
Right there.

311
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,936
I'm really sorry, I...

312
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,296
OK, well... Right, listen. Listen!

313
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,936
I wanna know where they've gone to
after that, OK?

314
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,936
I wanna know where they've gone,
who they've spoken to,

315
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,937
what tasks they were given.

316
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:58,936
Ben, a list of all high-security facilities

317
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,936
that use this biometric data.

318
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,936
Let's try and pinpoint a venue,
can we, please?

319
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,960
Let's try to make sure today wasn't
a complete fucking waste of time.

320
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,456
Can I just...? What?

321
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,936
Sorry, I need... I
need to go to the toilet.

322
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,960
Alison?!

323
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,480
Ashleigh?

324
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,960
Can we talk? Yeah.

325
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,936
Look, I'm really sorry
that I didn't get anything earlier.

326
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,160
Don't worry.

327
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,936
We were asking too much.

328
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,936
No, and James...
James wasn't angry with you.

329
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,960
This isn't just about stopping
a robbery. There's

330
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:00,936
Cruella, her husband
is in Belmarsh Prison for ten years,

331
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,960
for manslaughter.

332
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,936
A member of the public died
during their last armed robbery,

333
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,936
and James blames himself
for not stopping it.

334
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,936
That's why we're pushing really hard.

335
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,936
Was it... Was it James' fault?

336
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,936
No. The investigation cleared him,
but a man died.

337
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,936
And, you know, he had a wife.

338
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,936
So... sometimes,
the IOPC's blessing isn't enough.

339
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,936
Well... I could see a lot more

340
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,936
if you just get me closer.

341
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,936
I mean, I got a lot more in the wine bar.

342
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,136
I don't think that's a good idea.

343
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,936
OK. But The Tap is a pub, right?

344
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,936
The Canterbury Tap.

345
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,616
And they've put Liam in a flat nearby,

346
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,960
so maybe he might go in there.

347
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,960
Have you been researching the case?

348
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,936
No...

349
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,976
You really, really need to leave
the investigating to us.

350
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,960
But...

351
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,960
Hello. Cinnamon roll and a pastry.

352
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,960
My coffee?

353
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,936
Enjoy...

354
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,960
Did you use nut milk? No.

355
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,800
No. I'll get you another one.

356
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,960
Night. Alison!

357
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,936
Can we have a chat before you go?

358
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,616
OK.

359
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:39,960
I'm... really sorry, but Karl thinks
this isn't working out.

360
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,936
But he didn't ask for the nut milk.

361
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,936
And even if he did,
he waited till I turned away.

362
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,937
Look, I'm sorry.

363
00:32:51,961 --> 00:32:55,456
No, I really need this job. I know.

364
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,936
And I don't wanna lose you.

365
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,136
You're gonna find something else. No!

366
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,960
Samira!

367
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,960
Alison... You could've told me yourself.

368
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,296
Hello again.

369
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:45,320
Hi. Can I have
a half of Cold Zombie, please?

370
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,296
You know your craft beer, then?

371
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,936
I like the names. Cold Zombie.

372
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,296
Dead Pig Ditch. Bobby's Biscuit.

373
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,936
It makes it easier to lip-read
when people order them.

374
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,936
You work in a bar? Yeah, I used to.

375
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,456
But I'm currently looking for a job
at the moment.

376
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,960
We can never hold on to staff.

377
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,776
Wait, so are you looking?

378
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,936
Er... I know you're probably thinking,

379
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,976
"I don't wanna hire a deaf barmaid."...

380
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,936
But I will learn all your menu
before the first shift.

381
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,136
I don't get people's orders wrong.

382
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,136
I've got a day job,
but I could work any evening.

383
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,936
All right, OK. So what you're saying is...?

384
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,960
I'm saying give me a chance
and I'll show you.

385
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,960
I'm gonna try it around there.

386
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,960
Got it, thank you.

387
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,000
Hi.

388
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,960
What can I get for you?

389
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,960
Just a pint of IPA.

390
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,936
Are you, like, a regular here?

391
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,960
No, I just moved in around the corner.

392
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,960
I'd better remember your order, then.

393
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,960
Do you find it hard, with the music?

394
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,976
Sorry.

395
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,936
You're deaf, aren't you?

396
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,936
Or hard of hearing. Is that what you say?

397
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:41,160
I'm deaf. What did you say?

398
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,960
Does the music make it difficult for you?

399
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,936
Yeah, sometimes.

400
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,000
But I like the beat.

401
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,960
Yeah. This is a good one.

402
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,960
Bad day?

403
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,160
Just work.

404
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,640
Can I tell you a secret?

405
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,937
It's my first day,

406
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:12,936
and I pretended
I know everything about craft beer,

407
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,960
but I actually don't.

408
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,960
I just got a new job too.

409
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,320
What do you do?

410
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,960
It's too boring to explain.

411
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,000
That'll be 6.99.

412
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,960
What's your name?

413
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,960
I'm Alison.

414
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,640
Liam.

415
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,960
Have a good day. And you.

416
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,936
Hey, don't worry, I'll close up here.

417
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:12,937
You did good tonight.

418
00:38:12,961 --> 00:38:14,936
Come back tomorrow?
What do you think?

419
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,976
Yeah?

420
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,960
All right, yes.

421
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,320
You going? Closing, aren't you?

422
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,936
Gotta go to work. Night.

423
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,960
Good night.

424
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,960
Fuck! Are you OK?

425
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,936
Alison?! I'm fine. I'm OK.

426
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,936
I'll just get a bruised
arse in the morning.

427
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,936
Have you got a death wish?

428
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,936
I-I'm sorry. I forgot my lights.
Don't get up.

429
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,936
Don't get up! I'll be... I'll be fine.

430
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,936
I'll be fine, I'll be fine.

431
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,960
OK. You need a hospital.

432
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,960
I'll drive you.

433
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,960
You OK? Get in.

434
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,616
Sorry.

435
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,936
You were on your way somewhere.

436
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,616
I missed my meeting.

437
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,936
Besides...

438
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,136
This is more important.

439
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,960
I can't run you over
and then abandon you.

440
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,960
It's supposed to relieve stress.

441
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,960
That is weirdly effective.

442
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,960
Do you do this often?

443
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,440
Just throw yourself in front of cars?

444
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,320
It's my first time.

445
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,960
Well, I'm honoured you chose me.

446
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,616
Are you from Manchester?
I don't always get the accent.

447
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,136
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

448
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,960
Just got here,
and I barely know anyone, so...

449
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,960
Well, now I know you.

450
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,000
Now you know me.

451
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,936
- Is this happening now?
- Yeah.

452
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,296
We picked up a text. We know
they're meeting this morning,

453
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,960
but we don't have a location.

454
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,936
6-0-2.

455
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:21,937
New contact with Hoodie.

456
00:43:21,961 --> 00:43:23,936
All right.

457
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,936
Let's go. Nia?

458
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,960
We've got a text coming in.

459
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,776
Bright, walker, roast.

460
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,936
OK. Ben. Ben. Where is that?

461
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,936
There, it's by the splash park
in Vale Gardens.

462
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,936
OK. We've got a What3words location.

463
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,776
The gang are meeting
by the splash park in Vale Gardens.

464
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,976
Can we get officers there? '6-0-2.

465
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,456
'Hoodie is diverting. He's entering
the electronic shop on Beem Street.'

466
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,936
Wait, wait, wait.

467
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:47,937
Nothing on phones, Sir.

468
00:43:47,961 --> 00:43:50,936
Why... Why the change of location?
I dunno.

469
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,296
OK, there's a back alley
down the back of the shop.

470
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,936
Maybe he's trying to shake us?

471
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,936
Nothing on phones? What is he doing?

472
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,960
What is he doing?

473
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,936
Contact with Hoodie.

474
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:05,937
He's carrying a bag.

475
00:44:05,961 --> 00:44:07,976
Subject continuing east on foot
along Beem Street.

476
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,936
What is in that bag?
Can we see what he's bought?

477
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:11,960
Negative.

478
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,936
'Subject continuing on foot.

479
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,960
'Taking west turn into Vale Gardens.'

480
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,936
'6-0-1. New contact with Hoodie.

481
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:26,080
'Entering Vale Gardens,
headed toward the splash park.

482
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:29,960
'6-0-1.

483
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,936
'Hulk on site.'

484
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,960
Here we go.

485
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,136
He's saying he's sorry. OK.

486
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,936
If we set up a meeting, you turn up.

487
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,936
There's no fucking discussion!

488
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,960
Hulk is getting really angry.
Something about a meeting.

489
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,000
Alison. There.

490
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:09,936
What is he saying?

491
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,960
And... there, what's that?

492
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,936
There, what's he saying there?
We need to know what he's saying.

493
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,960
He's explaining something. What...?

494
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,320
Have you made contact
with Liam Barlow?

495
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,936
You've risked
the entire fucking operation.

496
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,936
Good morning, Mr Stanford.
I have an appointment.

497
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:38,937
I've got information.

498
00:45:38,961 --> 00:45:42,616
We were so clear to you about
the dangers of getting involved.

499
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,456
I didn't tell him I was
lip-reading for you.

500
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,936
You understand how dangerous
this is, being an informant?

501
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,800
I'll have to keep my eye on you.

502
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,000
