1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,936
Driver's phone just went off.

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:04,936
What? What? What happened?
They're switching the sim cards.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,936
If you can't read their phone messages,

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,936
then you're not gonna know
when they're gonna meet. So...

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:10,937
We'll find another way.

6
00:00:10,961 --> 00:00:15,776
Did you, or did you not,
follow the rules we gave you?

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,936
Sarah doesn't like
me changing numbers.

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,936
Sarah?

9
00:00:19,961 --> 00:00:21,616
Have you been working at the tap?

10
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,936
Hi. Hi.

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,936
I mean, of all the places,
Braden Moore owns the tap.

12
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,456
You've risked the entire operation.

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,960
Four shots. Whooping

14
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,936
good morning. I have an appointment.

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,360
You understand how dangerous
this is, becoming an informant?

16
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,960
What are you doing?

17
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,936
Am I late?

18
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,937
No, no, we're early.

19
00:01:29,961 --> 00:01:31,296
How are you?

20
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,456
I'm good.

21
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,800
Yeah? Yeah. I'm fine.

22
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,776
Are you sure?

23
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,960
Yeah.

24
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,937
Now that you're working with us,

25
00:01:42,961 --> 00:01:45,136
it's better that we meet
away from the station. Ok?

26
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,960
Why are we meeting?

27
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,936
Who is this?

28
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,960
A person of interest. Have
you seen him at the pub?

29
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,936
No. Why do you wanna know?

30
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,616
We just need to know if you've seen him.

31
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,936
We think the gang might
have been in contact with him,

32
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,937
and that worries us.

33
00:02:03,961 --> 00:02:06,616
But we really can't tell you anything else.

34
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,936
Ok. I will look out for him.

35
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,936
Yeah? Just while you're doing
your normal duties at the pub.

36
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,160
Don't put yourself in harm's way, ok?

37
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,960
Has something happened?

38
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,960
Er...

39
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,936
Do you...? Ok, the other day,
Braden and Liam, they took my phone.

40
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,936
They took your phone?
Did they see anything?

41
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,960
No. No. I always delete our messages.

42
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,936
You know you don't have to do this.
There must be other jobs you can do.

43
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,937
No, no. I have to do this.

44
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:39,936
I cannot go back to scraping that oven.

45
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,936
I'm ok. I know what I'm doing. Ok.

46
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,936
Text me any time.

47
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,776
All right. Go easy, yeah?

48
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,936
And remember that face.

49
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,320
Thank you.

50
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,160
Alison.

51
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,960
The password's 2-7-9-1. Help yourself.

52
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,937
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:12,961 --> 00:03:14,936
Look, I was an idiot.

54
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,936
Yeah. I still am.

55
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,936
Yes, you were. Can I explain?

56
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,960
Explain what, exactly?

57
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,960
We've got a bit of business we
need sorting, don't we, manc?

58
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,960
Door closes.

59
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,640
Mark...

60
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,296
Yeah? My mum just texted me,

61
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,776
and she's locked herself
out, and she needs my keys.

62
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,936
What you standing around
for? Go and help her.

63
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,936
Thank you. And I'm so sorry.

64
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,960
No, it's ok. No worries.

65
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,936
Four on every floor. At least.

66
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,936
Shame you can't manage them.

67
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,960
Muffled speech hey, don't shit yourself.

68
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,000
I've got it covered.

69
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,960
And inside the vault...

70
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,936
Muffled speech he's done this before.

71
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,936
He'll need detailed specs.

72
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,960
He will. But for now, we've got these.

73
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,936
They don't hold back, do they?
First time I've seen a photo.

74
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,976
Worth the effort, right?

75
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,960
Joseph, I know you don't wanna
keep going back, but we need to.

76
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,960
Speak to your insider.

77
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,960
She mouths

78
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,960
muffled speech.

79
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:33,960
Phone vibrates phone
clatters phone vibrates

80
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,960
vibrating continues

81
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,640
vibrating continues

82
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,960
vibrating continues.

83
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,936
Are you ok? Yeah.

84
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,936
Are you sure they didn't see you?
Yeah, I'm sure they didn't see me.

85
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,936
I told you not to go out
of your way to watch them.

86
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,936
Yeah, but you told me to look
out for the man in the photo,

87
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,936
and I thought they might be meeting him.

88
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,937
I was very clear.

89
00:08:30,961 --> 00:08:32,936
Alison, it's my responsibility
to keep you safe,

90
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,936
and if you're not gonna play by the rules,

91
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,960
then this isn't gonna work.

92
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,936
Do you understand?
Yes. But this is what I got.

93
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,960
"Llama treasure plates"? Yeah.

94
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,936
Live subtitles do this all the time.

95
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,616
You get used to it.

96
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,936
The app works by sorting the
sounds into nearest phonetics,

97
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,936
so "llama treasure plates"...

98
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,296
Is that right, Alison? "Llama
treasure plates" could be...

99
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,936
Pressure. Treasure. Treasure. Pressure.

100
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,936
Pressure plates. Maybe
llama could be "alarm".

101
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,936
Alarm is good. Alarmed pressure plates.

102
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,936
That works. What about the
next bit? "Person lies ash waves".

103
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,936
Personalised.

104
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,937
Personalised, but "ash waves"...

105
00:09:10,961 --> 00:09:13,776
Personalised. But "ash
waves", I don't know.

106
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,936
So, if the pressure plates
are on the floor... yeah.

107
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,280
Ash waves could be "pathways".

108
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,936
This bit's clear.

109
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,616
They're using weight-sensitive vaults

110
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,936
and dealing with
high-net-worth individuals.

111
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,937
They need help from an insider.

112
00:09:25,961 --> 00:09:28,136
They're trying to arrange a
meeting, can you see that?

113
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,960
And your app thinks the meeting is at.

114
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,936
"Eye centre dense rude".

115
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,960
Any guesses for that one?

116
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,937
Didn't think so.

117
00:09:38,961 --> 00:09:41,616
Ok, so, guys, Ben, Nia, absolutely critical

118
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,936
that we are at that meeting, yeah?

119
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,616
So all hands to the pump,

120
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,936
trying to decode where the hell that is.

121
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,936
And who is this insider
that they're meeting?

122
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,936
Let's try and figure
that out, yeah? Yes, sir.

123
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,937
Yeah.

124
00:09:50,961 --> 00:09:52,936
This is way beyond anything
we could have asked for.

125
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,136
This is brilliant.

126
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,936
Thank you.

127
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,937
Ok.

128
00:09:56,961 --> 00:09:59,936
And in the meantime, while we're
trying to figure out the location...

129
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,616
Keep an eye out at the tap?

130
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,960
Anything you can get, we appreciate.

131
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,960
Go on.

132
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,136
'Hello. This is Joe from access to work.

133
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,936
'I'm just calling to let you know
we've received your application,

134
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,936
'and the current wait
time for an assessment

135
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,960
'is 16 to 18 weeks, whereby
you will be assigned...'

136
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,960
Just give me both barrels.

137
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,936
Well, how do think it feels

138
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,937
for a woman to be alone with two men

139
00:11:53,961 --> 00:11:56,296
while they're looking through her phone?

140
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,936
Violating, I'd imagine.

141
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,960
Yeah.

142
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,936
I'm sorry that Braden scared you.

143
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,800
No, he didn't.

144
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,936
I fucked up. No excuse.

145
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,960
For me.

146
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,960
Trust, it don't come easy.

147
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,480
Just... just let me explain.

148
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,080
Are you working with Braden?

149
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,960
He's involved in my new work.

150
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,936
I owe him. He's letting
me stay in his flat.

151
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,936
Ok. Good luck with that.

152
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,936
Please.

153
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,936
Just one drink.

154
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,960
I'm sorry.

155
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,960
Well, we're closed.

156
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,320
I have a few tinnies at mine.

157
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,960
You spoil me.

158
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,800
Don't expect much.

159
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,616
Yeah. Tinnie?

160
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,960
Yeah. Yeah.

161
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,296
Thank you.

162
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,960
To second chances?

163
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,960
You said you were going to explain.

164
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:20,960
So... why don't you
tell me about you, then?

165
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,960
What do you wanna know?

166
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,960
Why you don't trust people.

167
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,960
All right.

168
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,960
I know what it's like to be scared.

169
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,960
I haven't seen my dad for years.

170
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,456
But... he left a Mark.

171
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,936
Several, actually.

172
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,936
Sometimes, I think I
see him in the street.

173
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,936
Can hardly breathe, you know?

174
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,936
Getting ready to, like, run or fight.

175
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,960
So, where is your dad?

176
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,000
He fucked off when I was a kid.

177
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:09,936
And then I ended up just
pin balling between foster homes.

178
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,616
I've calmed down a lot since then,

179
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:19,936
but whenever I meet someone
who gives me the time of day,

180
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,960
I'm still like...

181
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,936
"What's wrong with them?"

182
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,000
And then I met someone like you.

183
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,320
Alison laughs

184
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,936
you know, you have beautiful eyes.

185
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,936
Laughs so now you're pissed.

186
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,936
Doesn't make it any less true.

187
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:48,936
You know, apparently,
every Iris is completely unique,

188
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,936
like a fingerprint.

189
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,960
Really?

190
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,936
What makes you think of this stuff?

191
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,936
You.

192
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,937
Me?

193
00:15:59,961 --> 00:16:03,936
Staring at me with those big old...

194
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,136
Those... I'm not staring.

195
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,136
Yeah, you are. No. No, I'm not.

196
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,936
Sorry. I know it's not
because I'm that handsome.

197
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,936
Is that right?

198
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,480
Spent my entire life not being looked at.

199
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,936
No, I get that.

200
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:24,296
When I get a bit lost and
people say, "never mind,"

201
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,936
or, "I'll tell you later,"
but they never do,

202
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,960
that's when I feel
ignored, and I hate that.

203
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,960
You are, by the way.

204
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,640
What?

205
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,960
That handsome.

206
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,000
Phone vibrates.

207
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,936
You know...

208
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,960
It's pretty fucked up to read
someone else's messages.

209
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,936
So now we're even, then.

210
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,960
Now we're even.

211
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,960
I should go.

212
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,960
Thank you.

213
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,960
Distant siren wails.

214
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,960
Sorry...

215
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,136
Hi. Sorry.

216
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,960
Sorry about the carnage in here. Hi.

217
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,936
Ok, how did you find out that
they're meeting at the ice rink?

218
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,936
Right, I saw a text on Liam's phone.

219
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,616
He left it on the bar
before he went to the toilet.

220
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,936
Who was the text from?

221
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,640
An unknown number. It
wasn't stored in his phone.

222
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,936
And he was at the bar? Yeah.

223
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,960
Do you talk a lot with Liam?

224
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,960
Yeah, because how else
can I get close to him?

225
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,640
Alison, I've.

226
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,456
I say this from experience.

227
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,960
That what is exciting isn't
always what's best for you.

228
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,136
Yeah.

229
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,960
But why are they meeting at the ice rink?

230
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,936
Because... it's unexpected.

231
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,160
Music blares and because
surveillance is a nightmare.

232
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,936
Loud music, bad
audio, lots of movement.

233
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:45,960
Scraping, music plays
so... You need me?

234
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,616
Rap music plays

235
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,936
we're not gonna get
any audio through this.

236
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,960
Glitchy audio playback

237
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,136
yeah. They've chosen this venue
for a reason, haven't they? Yeah.

238
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,936
It's because this meeting is significant.

239
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,960
6-0-1 in position. No eyes yet.

240
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,960
Ok, where are we at
with the visual, 6-0-2?

241
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,960
6-0-2. Nothing yet.

242
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,960
Come on.

243
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,960
There. Top screen.

244
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,936
'6-0-1. I have a visual.

245
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,000
'Hulk, Cruella and hoodie
entering via north door.'

246
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,936
Yeah, but we're gonna
need more than that.

247
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,936
That's no good. Yeah.
Can we get a clearer visual?

248
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,960
6-0-2. We'll try.

249
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,640
6-0-1. On it.

250
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,936
What about that screen there?

251
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,936
We're gonna need more than that.

252
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,937
Yeah, we are.

253
00:22:12,961 --> 00:22:14,960
Ok, can we get a clearer visual, please?

254
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,136
No, I can't see their
faces clearly. Can you...?

255
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,960
Come on, guys.

256
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,616
They're here.

257
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,296
'6-0-2. New contact with
wolf and unknown ic-4 female

258
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,960
'in a Navy blazer.'

259
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,936
Up there. Did you hear that,
Nia? Unknown ic-4 female.

260
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,640
Working on it. Thank you.

261
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,936
Fuck's sake. Ok... What's happened?

262
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,936
The screens have gone completely
dead our end. What's going on?

263
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,960
Not now. Not now, guys.
'6-0-1. Sorry, we'll reset.'

264
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,296
they're back on. Thank god for that. Ok.

265
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,960
Beep there we go.

266
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,616
Ok. Anything you can get on that
woman there in the Navy blazer,

267
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,936
anything at all. Blue jacket.

268
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,776
Alison, if you just focus on this one

269
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,800
and just tune everything else out.

270
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,960
Wolf said, "this is a friend of mine."

271
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,960
"We go a long way back."

272
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,960
Something, something.

273
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,160
"I trust her."

274
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,936
He says her name. Which is?

275
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,936
Sand... sand... I think
it's Sandra. Brilliant.

276
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,936
And then he said her last name.

277
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,936
I think it's with b or m. I don't know.

278
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,616
But it ended with, like, a "sh". Brilliant.

279
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,936
Ok, Nia, check any kind of Sandra.

280
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,936
All associates known to Cruella, to wolf.

281
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,776
Cross-check with all associates.

282
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,936
Anything else you can get,
anything at all, that's great.

283
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,000
Alison mutters.

284
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,320
"I've been doing this
for a very long time."

285
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,937
"I'm very good at it."

286
00:24:11,961 --> 00:24:14,976
Yeah, well, we'll fucking
see. That's what Cruella said.

287
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,960
Yeah.

288
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,960
Package. They're talking about package.

289
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,616
Hoodie says they need to wait.

290
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,936
Yeah.

291
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,936
To the gram... No, no, no.
He said the exact weight.

292
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,936
Ok. The weight? The exact...

293
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,936
The exact weight. I think
he said "to the gram".

294
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,936
To the gram? Yes.

295
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,936
That'll be to get around
the weight-sensitive vault.

296
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,936
Maybe they need something to stand in

297
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,960
for whatever it is they're stealing.

298
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,936
Meeting... meeting over. It's breaking up.

299
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,936
They're breaking up now. Yeah.

300
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,937
Chandra.

301
00:24:57,961 --> 00:25:00,960
How do you spell it? C-h-a-n-d-r-a.

302
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,936
Ok. Ok. I think we've got an ID
on the woman in the Navy blazer.

303
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,456
She's chandra bakshi. Yes!

304
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,936
That's it. Chandra
bakshi. She is the insider.

305
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,936
She works on the
transport team of a billionaire

306
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,976
by the name of Amir joshi.

307
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,480
Amir joshi? So he's the target.

308
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,936
He's head of one of the
wealthiest families in India,

309
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,936
and he's just arrived in the UK.

310
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,960
Whatever the gang is stealing,
Amir joshi has brought it with him.

311
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,960
Sir. What have we got?

312
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,936
Ben, Amir joshi, we know
him? Yes. We know him, sir.

313
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,936
We know this guy? Ok. And
he just touched down in London

314
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,936
for a quarterly meeting with his investors.

315
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,776
He arrived on the 7th of
September. On the 7th? Yes.

316
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,936
Which was the opening of the
window for the gang's robbery.

317
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,936
Ok, so let's get a full
profile on Amir joshi.

318
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,936
I wanna know his
business, his associates,

319
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,936
which security companies he uses.

320
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,296
Find out which vault he uses in Mayfair.

321
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,936
Do we notify him or his team?

322
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,936
No. We already know
he's got one insider,

323
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,937
so there may well be others,

324
00:26:01,961 --> 00:26:03,936
but let's just hang
back for the time being,

325
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,936
until we get more information. Very good.

326
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,136
I got it? You got it.

327
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,936
Thanks to you. This is great.

328
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,776
Thank you.

329
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,960
It's good.

330
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,960
Let's go. Thanks, Alison.

331
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,960
Alison, I'll walk you out.

332
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,960
Just through there.

333
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,960
Problem?

334
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,936
Yeah. It's about Alison.
She did very well today.

335
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,936
She's good. She's really
good, there's no doubt.

336
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,936
But that's... That's what worries me.

337
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,936
'She's invested.' 'Meaning?'

338
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,936
'well, this is a bit beyond
the call of duty for a civvy.'

339
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,936
before Alison, we were pissing
in the wind. You know that.

340
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,936
Now we have a case,
no? It's that simple.

341
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,936
But is it simple? Yeah.

342
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,936
Because it's our duty
to protect her. Protect!

343
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,136
It is. Would you be saying that

344
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,480
if our source wasn't deaf?

345
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,776
I don't know. Yeah, I think... Yeah?

346
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,296
Yeah, I would. I would.

347
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,936
'Alison, she's smart, she's capable.

348
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,936
'I just... we know Braden is
in contact with a gun runner.'

349
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,937
I have got a bad feeling about it.

350
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:12,936
Ok. So, fine, so we keep
a close eye on her, right?

351
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,936
But we need this.

352
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,960
Right? We really need this. Understand?

353
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,960
Yeah. Course, guv.

354
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,936
You make pub friends fast.

355
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,936
Well, I'm new here.
Can't be too discriminating.

356
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,960
Charming.

357
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:42,960
How about I take you on a
proper date tomorrow night?

358
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,960
I mean, no pressure, just if you want to.

359
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,640
Course. I would like that.

360
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,960
I'll find somewhere, let you
know and text you the plan.

361
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,120
See you later. See you later.

362
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,937
Hey, what can I get for you?

363
00:28:02,961 --> 00:28:05,936
Hiya. Can I get a pint of
Bobby's biscuit, please?

364
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,160
Yeah. Thanks.

365
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,936
That'll be 6.99.

366
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,960
Card machine beeps

367
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,160
thank you.

368
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,936
What are you looking at?

369
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,960
What?

370
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,160
You've got customers.

371
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,960
Almost done.

372
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,936
'So, tell me, what exactly did you see?'

373
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,936
the man in the photo
gave a bag to Braden.

374
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,976
And then Braden gave
it to Mark to store it.

375
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,936
And then he looked really scared.
I think they used the word "guns".

376
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,936
What, you think, but you're not sure?

377
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,937
But "gun" is a difficult word.

378
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:04,936
It could be fun, it
could be gun, it... right.

379
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,136
But I think it is "gun".

380
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:10,616
Ok. And the bag, is it in the pub now?

381
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,936
It could be.

382
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,936
Could be. But you're not sure?

383
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,936
Ok, all right, I'm sorry
to press you on this.

384
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,936
It's just if there is a weapon,
we legally can't ignore it.

385
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,936
But they will know that
someone has told you.

386
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,776
We will sort it, ok, Alison?

387
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,616
I just... You need to
stay away from the tap.

388
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,936
Just stay away for the day

389
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,456
and, I don't know, go and see a friend.

390
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,936
Do something normal. Ok?

391
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,960
Ok. Ok.

392
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,936
'We think this is the likeliest target.'

393
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,936
very subtle. Where'd
you get the images?

394
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,936
Auctioneers. Joshi's been in
touch with the top three in London.

395
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,937
He's obviously looking to sell.

396
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:02,976
A weapon, when we're this
close, is all we need, isn't it?

397
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,936
But we can't ignore the intel.

398
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,296
Yeah. If it was a gun.

399
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,936
We move in now, they
shut the whole plan down.

400
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,936
We blow our cover for
nothing. Yeah, agree.

401
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,936
We need to play it carefully.

402
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,800
Time we did a drug check on the tap.

403
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,960
Afternoon.

404
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,936
What are you doing here?

405
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,960
I'm visiting my favourite employee.

406
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,960
Should my ears be burning?

407
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,960
Well.

408
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,936
I can't say the conversation
has been flowing,

409
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,960
but she makes a stern cuppa, your mum.

410
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,960
Clicks his tongue

411
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,937
dad legged it, has he?

412
00:33:07,961 --> 00:33:09,936
How do you know he's not gonna

413
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,936
walk through that door at any moment?

414
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,960
He chuckles there's
no man at this house.

415
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:20,960
I am made up that Liam
is getting his leg over.

416
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,960
But I don't like you.

417
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,960
I don't trust you.

418
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,960
So stay out of the way
when working at my pub.

419
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,320
Thanks again, mrs Brooks!

420
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,936
No wonder your dad left.

421
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,800
Would drive me up the
wall, living with you lot.

422
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,936
Ds Sara burns. How are you?

423
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,136
Good, yeah.

424
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,960
Sara clears her throat

425
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,960
we have a search warrant issued
under the misuse of drugs act.

426
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,937
What's going on here?

427
00:34:37,961 --> 00:34:40,936
It's an illegal substance
check, sir. What?

428
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,936
It's a standard check. A dealer
was caught in the alleyway outside.

429
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,960
Go. Thanks.

430
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,960
I swear to fucking
god, this is not me, bray.

431
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,936
Course not. You wouldn't be that thick.

432
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,960
Not with your family to think about.

433
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,960
Can I come in?

434
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,960
You didn't turn up.

435
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,960
I waited an hour for you.

436
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,936
I thought before, we
had a real connection.

437
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,937
After everything I told you...

438
00:36:02,961 --> 00:36:05,000
Well, not everything is about you.

439
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,976
You don't know anything about my life.

440
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,936
Why do you think I asked you out?

441
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,960
I want to. I want to know everything.

442
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,960
Well, we're getting evicted. You
didn't know about that, did you?

443
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,937
Shit.

444
00:36:20,961 --> 00:36:22,960
I... I'm sorry.

445
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,800
You're involved in something illegal?

446
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,960
Just don't lie to me.

447
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,936
It's not what you think.

448
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,960
What is it, then?

449
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,960
I can't.

450
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,936
Do you hurt people?

451
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,936
No. That's not who I am.

452
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,936
Then who are you?

453
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,960
I will tell you. But I need more time.

454
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,776
Please.

455
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,936
You can't throw this away
before it's had a chance to...

456
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,960
That's exactly why I'm doing it.

457
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,160
Knock on door.

458
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,360
All right, bray? Mind if I come in?

459
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,960
Course not.

460
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,640
What you doing?

461
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,776
What is that?

462
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,936
Something I'm very glad I
decided not to keep at the pub.

463
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,160
If it's what I think it is, I
don't want it in my flat.

464
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,320
This ain't your flat.

465
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,936
When did you put it there? Last night.

466
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,960
I've got keys. Come and go as I please.

467
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,960
Helen told me no guns.

468
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,937
Well, take a look.

469
00:38:32,961 --> 00:38:34,936
I don't need to look.

470
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,937
I'm just getting you through the tech.

471
00:38:35,961 --> 00:38:37,960
Those are nothing to do with me.

472
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:45,936
You're in this now, and I'm
gonna tell you how we do things.

473
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:49,936
I don't know you. I
don't fucking trust you.

474
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,936
This is how it's gonna be.

475
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,456
Ok? Ok.

476
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,960
Good.

477
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,936
Alison, you all right? Is Ashleigh here?

478
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,936
Ashleigh? Training
day today. Can I help?

479
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,936
Well, you said I must tell you... Yeah.

480
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,936
If I have contact with anybody
that you're investigating.

481
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,937
I did say that. Yeah, yeah.

482
00:41:04,961 --> 00:41:06,936
Well, wolf... Yeah?

483
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,936
Joseph, he's trying to evict me.

484
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,296
Joseph holhurst.

485
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,960
He's been on our radar a few years.

486
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,456
He has a history of
starting up companies,

487
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,936
getting them into debt and
then declaring them bankrupt.

488
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,936
Then moving on, starting
up another company.

489
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,776
Now he's landed at Hollis & byrne.

490
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,936
What, he's allowed to do
that? Well, life's unfair, isn't it?

491
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,960
Life is unfair.

492
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,936
But we know he's involved in a robbery.

493
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,936
And he gets to kick me and
my mum out of our home?

494
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,960
It's upsetting, I get it. It's upsetting.

495
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,936
But the thing about
Joseph is he's careful.

496
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,936
Switched on. He knows how to
appear to be on the right side of the law.

497
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,936
The gang's last robbery was a jeweller's.

498
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,456
Jewellery store.

499
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,936
Jewellery. Yeah, yeah.

500
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,936
Jewellery store, three years ago.

501
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,936
Innocent man, member of the
public, got shot at close range.

502
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,616
Wife couldn't even identify him.

503
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,936
The jeweller took a round
of bullets through the back

504
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,936
while running for the alarm.

505
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:06,937
Still works at the place,

506
00:42:06,961 --> 00:42:08,960
behind the counter,
but from a wheelchair.

507
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,936
These are the people
we're dealing with, Alison.

508
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,960
Now, we managed to get
Helen's husband, Alfie red man...

509
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,936
Not a nice man. We got him
sent down for manslaughter,

510
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,936
which ain't great, but believe me, I tried.

511
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:25,936
And the rest of the gang got away with it.

512
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,936
I know Braden Moore
pulled one of those triggers.

513
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,936
And he's got another gun.
All of their hands are bloody.

514
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,936
And the only way we're
gonna get them put behind bars

515
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,936
is if we catch them in the act.

516
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,936
That way, we get Joseph
on a conspiracy charge,

517
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,960
we get Braden, we get
the whole sorry lot of them.

518
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:45,936
But that takes Patience, hard graft,
and you've gotta keep a cool head.

519
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:49,936
Ashleigh thinks you're too, involved.

520
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:53,936
The information that you're
giving us is very helpful.

521
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:57,960
But you're not police. And
this shouldn't be your fight.

522
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:00,936
It'd only raise suspicions

523
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,936
if you just disappear straight after
they'd done spot-checks in the pub.

524
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,936
Best thing you could do right now

525
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,960
is go down there and
hand in your notice.

526
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,960
'But how would you catch them?'

527
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,960
I don't think I could live with
myself if Braden hurts someone.

528
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:22,960
You're hard-working, I see
that, and you're determined.

529
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,960
But I know this is a lot to ask of you.

530
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,960
Ashleigh says you have doubts.

531
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,640
I can do this. I know that.

532
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,936
Your help makes it much
more likely that we'll catch them.

533
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,936
'But it would mean spending
more time with Braden and Liam.'

534
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,160
'i can try and keep my distance.'

535
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,160
you're sure?

536
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,960
'Yeah, I'm... I'm sure.'

537
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:56,960
ok.

538
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,960
Hi.

539
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:23,136
Sorry. I know you said...
Mark told me you had a shift,

540
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,960
and I didn't wanna leave it like that.

541
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,960
I'm sorry about last night.

542
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,936
You don't need someone
like me in your life,

543
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,960
not with everything you've got going on.

544
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,320
I meant what I said.

545
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I would never hurt anyone.

546
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:56,960
I know you wouldn't.

547
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,160
I'd better go in.

548
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,960
Alison...

549
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,936
Welcome to the hawthorne estate hotel,

550
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:34,937
mr and mrs standford.

551
00:45:34,961 --> 00:45:37,936
Never been tempted to
bend the rules a little bit?

552
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:38,937
Are you watching them?

553
00:45:38,961 --> 00:45:41,936
Think they'd even notice
if they lost something?

554
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:47,296
Now, your throb-on for that girl
is starving your brain of oxygen.

555
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,976
I swear to you, no-one will be hurt.

556
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,160
