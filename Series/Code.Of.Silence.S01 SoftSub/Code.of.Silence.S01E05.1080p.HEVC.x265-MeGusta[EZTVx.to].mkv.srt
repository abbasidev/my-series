1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,936
Liam has invited me away.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,936
Overnight? A day trip.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,936
Never been tempted to
bend the rules a little bit?

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,616
Liam has a really nice smile,

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,936
but it doesn't mean he's not a criminal.

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,936
'Liam was watching
some people in the hotel.

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,936
'Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's the joshis.'

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,936
he hacked into the hotel's cctv.

9
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,800
Let's hope he's not watching you.

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,936
So, you saw Liam watching
Amir and his daughter reshmi?

11
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,936
Yeah, Liam asked me to lip-read them.

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,456
I saw them talking about bidding.

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,936
I think they were talking
about the necklace.

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,936
We're gonna take it from an
ultra-secure vault in London.

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,960
I need you to keep it
secret until we're done.

16
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,960
Kettle boiling.

17
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,960
Engine turns off.

18
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,936
Knock on door, vacuum whirring

19
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,960
'waterfall' by the stone
roses vacuum stops

20
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,936
James! Good to see you.

21
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,936
Good song. God. Sorry. I'll turn it down.

22
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,936
Don't turn it down on my account.

23
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,960
Volume decreases.

24
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,936
I remember going to
watch these at the astoria.

25
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,936
Must've been, what, 15 years ago?

26
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,616
Charlie was desperate to go.

27
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,936
Was he? I said we couldn't afford it.

28
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,936
We had a bust-up
about it. James chuckles

29
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,936
by the time he'd convinced
me it was possibly the best thing

30
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,800
we could do with our
money, it was sold out.

31
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,936
Thanks for... being here.

32
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,960
But the anniversary's not until next week.

33
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,960
'Yeah, I know. I know. It's just...

34
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,960
'Charlie's been on my mind
a lot recently, you know?'

35
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,000
I know it must be hard.

36
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,936
And if... look, if me coming
round is a bad reminder, then...

37
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,936
It isn't. I appreciate it.

38
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,776
Ok. Really.

39
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,936
Ok.

40
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,936
She chuckles softly funny.

41
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,936
Charlie would've liked you.

42
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,960
But if he was still here, we
wouldn't have met, would we?

43
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,640
You made sure Alfie
red man went to prison.

44
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,040
Not for nearly long enough.

45
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,936
And Helen and Braden
are still out there. Just...

46
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,240
Feel like I'm missing something.

47
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,000
Phone buzzes.

48
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,960
Keypad clacking.

49
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,960
Can he do that?

50
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,960
Yeah, he says he can't
afford maintenance payments.

51
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,936
I'm sorry, I'm, er

52
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,936
I'm gonna have to go. I'll call you back.

53
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,136
Thanks.

54
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,960
Phone thuds.

55
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm sorry you're still
struggling with the divorce.

56
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,960
Thanks.

57
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,320
Not gonna lie... Makes me a bit nervous.

58
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,960
What, you joining the club?

59
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,960
No. Look, this legal stuff... is hell.

60
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,960
But it's nothing compared to
being in a marriage that isn't working.

61
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,936
Ok, Nia? Ok, ok, ok. Nia.

62
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,960
Ok, team.

63
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,776
I've just got off the phone to
my contact in hat ton garden.

64
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,936
He's ex-cop turned private security.

65
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,616
He has heard whispers that
the jewels are being shown

66
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,936
tomorrow at a private
view for a potential buyer.

67
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,936
So maybe, I don't know...
Maybe the gang are thinking

68
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,936
of hitting at a moment of weaker security

69
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,936
while the jewels are
in transit, I don't know.

70
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,936
Braden's gun is still unaccounted for.

71
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,936
Shit, Braden's gun is
still unaccounted for.

72
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,936
So I need to phone the cps

73
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,936
and get them to agree
to a conspiracy charge.

74
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,936
Do you think we have enough evidence?

75
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,936
We've got the gang discussing
details of vault security.

76
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,936
And a sighting of the
vault's security plans.

77
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,296
Yeah, but that's from Alison, so...

78
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,960
Also need to tell the cps of Alison's.

79
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,936
Association with Liam Barlow, don't I?

80
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,937
Which they're really not gonna like.

81
00:06:03,961 --> 00:06:06,136
I mean, they're really not gonna like that.

82
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,960
Do we have a location
for Amir joshi right now?

83
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,776
The joshi family are back in London.

84
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,936
Amir joshi is going to be
at a meeting for investors,

85
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,456
according to the times' business page.

86
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,936
Ok. I mean, it's too
risky to wait, isn't it?

87
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,960
It's just way too risky. Ok. So, I need to.

88
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,936
I need to call the cps
and set up a meeting.

89
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,960
Ok. If we get the nod,
we need to be ready to go.

90
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,936
So let's get a current location
for every member of this gang.

91
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,320
Ok.

92
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,960
Ok, that'll do. Cheers.

93
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,480
You... you got here fast.

94
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,960
Dad, were you dealing?

95
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,000
Just a little bit of weed.

96
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,640
Look, look... You ok? Y-Your text, it...

97
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,160
He sighs softly.

98
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,960
That's great. Yeah, thank
you. Thanks. Cheers.

99
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,936
Sir? Yeah.

100
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,936
The met finally got back to me.

101
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,296
They said someone
snitched on Danny Heath.

102
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,936
That's why he was convicted.

103
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,776
Yeah.

104
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,960
Liam, presumably. But why?

105
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,296
I mean, we should be on top
of this by now, shouldn't we?

106
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,936
Why did Liam take Alison to the hotel?

107
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,936
And how does cloning the joshis'
devices get them into the vault?

108
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,936
I mean, maybe we're getting complacent.

109
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,936
We don't look complacent to me.

110
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,960
Well, we didn't last time, either.

111
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,160
Screwdriver clicking.

112
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,960
Phone buzzes.

113
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,936
Yeah.

114
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,320
Hey, are you ok?

115
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,400
There's something
that you need to know.

116
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,960
What? What is it?

117
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,936
Ok, Liam told me everything.

118
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,296
He showed me photos of the necklace.

119
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,936
They're gonna hit the vault,
maybe even tonight. What?

120
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,936
'When did he tell you this?'

121
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,776
'last night.'

122
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,800
'wait, why are you just telling us now?'

123
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,960
'because... Liam trusts me.'

124
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,936
and I didn't expect to like
him when I first started this.

125
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,136
'Alison. Alison, this is important.

126
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,936
'Did Liam say how they
were gonna get into the vault?'

127
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,936
'n-no, he didn't say.'

128
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,456
Liam sighs I can't let him
go ahead with the robbery.

129
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,976
They're not gonna.
We're gonna stop 'em, ok?

130
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,936
But, listen, you cannot see Liam again.

131
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,960
Ok? He's dangerous.

132
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,960
Ok. Ok?

133
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,960
Ok.

134
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,136
Yeah. Yeah, no, I got it. I got it.

135
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,960
Yeah, I'll be in touch.

136
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,936
Cps have agreed to a conspiracy charge.

137
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,136
The information from Alison
actually tipped the balance.

138
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,296
I mean, they don't want her
anywhere near a court, obviously,

139
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,936
but, er... they have advised

140
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,936
that we should bring in
Helen, Braden and Liam.

141
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,936
Ok, so we just have
to stick the landing now.

142
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,936
Just gotta stick the landing. Ben? Yeah?

143
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,776
How're we doing on
locating our suspects?

144
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,936
We've traced their vehicles.

145
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,296
They were all outside their residences,

146
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,936
but so far, we've not got eyes
on Helen, Braden or Liam. Ok.

147
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,456
Seems unlikely that
they're all having a lie-in, no?

148
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,936
So let's pull cctv images
from around their homes

149
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,296
for the last 12 hours and get on 'em.

150
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,936
Wait, wait, wait.

151
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,936
So, sorry, Alison said they
could be hitting the vault

152
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,936
as soon as tonight.

153
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,936
But if they've already
gone to ground, then...

154
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,936
The gang could be hitting
the vault before tonight.

155
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,960
Yeah. Fuck. Ok. We
should get down there, fast.

156
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,136
Ben? Yeah?

157
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,296
Can you get onto the met

158
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,936
and get them to send
an armed response unit?

159
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,936
If they are making an
attempt on the vault,

160
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,960
I don't wanna take any chances, yeah?

161
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,320
Door opens.

162
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,936
You ok? Yeah.

163
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,936
I just... Liam sighs

164
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,936
I've just got to go out for a bit.

165
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,616
Where you going?
We're leaving in a hour.

166
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,936
Just gotta pick summat
up. A bit of kit for back-up.

167
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,936
But we've been planning this for weeks.

168
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,000
I'll be back in time. Don't worry.

169
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,960
Footsteps recede door opens, closes

170
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,960
Braden inhales sharply.

171
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,960
Thanks for meeting me here.

172
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,960
Did you think about what I said?

173
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,960
Please...

174
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,960
Don't do this.

175
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,960
If you stop, we could walk away.

176
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,936
We could be together. Maybe
we can move away from here.

177
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,960
We could be anything we
wanna be and be happy.

178
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,960
It's too late.

179
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,936
Look, if Braden's gonna
walk into that vault with a gun,

180
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,936
people will die.

181
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,936
So if you care enough about
me to come away with you,

182
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,616
then, please, just don't do this.

183
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,936
You don't understand.

184
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,960
I can't walk away from this.

185
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,936
I can't.

186
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,960
But.

187
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,960
I thought the Liam that I
know won't let anybody get hurt.

188
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,136
If you walk into that vault, you're
gonna get caught. I know that.

189
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,960
How do you know that? Scoffs.

190
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,936
I'm just worried. No.

191
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,936
You said that you know
that I'm gonna get caught.

192
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,960
What do you know?

193
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,960
No, no, I don't know anything. I.

194
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,800
I told you things last night.

195
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,960
I put it all on the line for you.

196
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,960
I need to know...

197
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,960
Can I trust you?

198
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,960
Yeah. You can t-trust me.

199
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,960
Inhales sharply.

200
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,160
You should go.

201
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,960
Ben?

202
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,936
I've located Helen and Joseph.

203
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,936
They took a taxi from Joseph's office,

204
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,456
and looks like they're headed to a
Hollis and byrne residence meeting.

205
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,776
Yep. They're giving
themselves cast-iron alibis.

206
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,936
They were never gonna get
their hands dirty, were they?

207
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,936
Ok. Tell uniform not to take
them out of their sights. Yeah.

208
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,960
We need to find Braden and Liam. Yeah.

209
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,960
Hello. Thank you.

210
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,936
- Sergeant.
- Sir.

211
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,936
You spoken to them? No
sign of any disturbance.

212
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,936
But the duty manager isn't
keen on sharing information.

213
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,160
Not keen? I'll see about that.

214
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,960
Can I have a look?

215
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,960
We're gonna take it from an
ultra-secure vault in London.

216
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,960
'You have to trust me.'

217
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,640
Ringing tone er, sorry.
One... one second.

218
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,296
Yeah. Could we get mr joshi
out of that meeting, please?

219
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,960
It's very important that we speak to him.

220
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,960
Yep. I'll hold.

221
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,936
Croesus vaults' clientele
value our discretion.

222
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,936
You must understand
the level of security risk

223
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,937
involved in high-value items.

224
00:19:46,961 --> 00:19:48,936
I do understand. I do
understand the security risk.

225
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,960
That's why I'm here.

226
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,937
Anything?

227
00:19:52,961 --> 00:19:54,960
I'm being bounced between assistants.

228
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,960
Ashleigh sighs.

229
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,936
I have got credible information

230
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,936
that a gang of very organised criminals

231
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,296
are planning a hit on this vault today.

232
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,776
Now, do you wanna be
the one to tell your client

233
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,960
that you ignored my warning?

234
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,160
Give me a minute.

235
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,960
Keyboard clacking.

236
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,936
According to our system,

237
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,936
mr joshi's vault was
emptied earlier today.

238
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,936
The contents were moved
at the owner's request.

239
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,936
Moved where?

240
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,936
They didn't... They
don't share a destination.

241
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,937
I-I wouldn't expect them to.

242
00:20:38,961 --> 00:20:41,936
Yep, we'll be in touch as
soon as we know anything.

243
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,936
Amir joshi thinks the
jewels are still here.

244
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,160
Yeah, well, as this nice gentleman
has finally admitted, they're not.

245
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,936
Miss joshi sent the courier.
We verified the request.

246
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,936
The... that's the Van.

247
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,960
Sorry, did you say
miss joshi sent the Van?

248
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,960
Fuck. The daughter. Fuck.

249
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,456
No, no. Just got here now.

250
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,976
Yeah. Nia?

251
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,640
Yeah, yeah. Give us two seconds, sir.

252
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,976
Ok. Hold on.

253
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,616
Ok, you're good.

254
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,936
The Van that has just left

255
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,936
with the contents of the
vault, its registration is

256
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,776
Lima-foxtrot-five,
seven-foxtrot-Sierra-kilo.

257
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,936
'I need a trace on that Van, Ben.'

258
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,936
yeah, we're just loading the anpr now.

259
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,456
I have the Van on the
a2, heading out of London.

260
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,936
It pings at a camera on
the a2 and then nothing.

261
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,936
Reshmi joshi ordered
the jewels to be moved.

262
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,936
Now, her dad doesn't know
where she's taken them,

263
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,240
but it seems likely the gang do.

264
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,136
Excuse me?

265
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,936
My phone is completely dead,
and I really need to text my mum.

266
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,936
Please can I borrow your phone? Is it...?

267
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,937
Sure.

268
00:21:42,961 --> 00:21:45,640
Thank you so much. Thank you.

269
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,320
Thank you so much.

270
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,937
'Has it gone off the a-road?'

271
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:12,136
yeah. Several b-roads
heading out in each direction.

272
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,936
'None of them have traffic cameras.'

273
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,937
phone buzzes it's Alison.

274
00:22:14,961 --> 00:22:16,936
She's texting me from different numbers.

275
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,936
She says the robbery's at
the hawthorne estate hotel.

276
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,936
That's where she was with Liam.

277
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,976
Hawthorne estate hotel. Ben,
is that where they're heading?

278
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,936
'Alison says the robbery is there,
but we don't have confirmation.'

279
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,456
er, yeah. Yeah, that makes
sense, given where we lost the Van.

280
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,936
It's about an hour away, at least.

281
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,936
Ben, could you head down there,
take a look, with extreme caution?

282
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,937
'We don't know if we can trust Alison,

283
00:22:34,961 --> 00:22:36,936
'and we don't know
what we're walking into.

284
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,976
'I'll get an armed response there

285
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,960
'as back-up as soon as I can.' Yes, sir.

286
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,936
Hey. You ready? Shit, sorry.

287
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,936
I meant to text you. Ok.
Er, we can do dinner later?

288
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,136
Sorry. Crazy day.

289
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,936
Ok. Call me when you're
done. I don't mind what time.

290
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,960
Sure.

291
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,000
Park at the back.

292
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,120
Camera shutter clicks lovely.

293
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,000
Five minutes.

294
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,936
Ok. I think we'll do a few more here.

295
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,936
Then we can get you in the
black beaded couture on the stairs.

296
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,937
Not making any promises,

297
00:24:13,961 --> 00:24:16,936
but I think that could
just get us the cover.

298
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,976
But that dress needs the necklace.

299
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,960
They'll be here any minute.

300
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,960
Navi sighs

301
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,960
ok. So... good.

302
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,960
Chuckles softly

303
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,960
rolled out the red carpet.

304
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,960
That's the courier.

305
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,960
Let's do it.

306
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,960
Exhales.

307
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,960
Yeah.

308
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,320
Computer beeps, chirps.

309
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,936
Hotel security approaching.

310
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,960
'Keep walking.

311
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,160
'Told you.'

312
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,936
Unlocking now.

313
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,960
Go on through.

314
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,320
Necklace has changed
hands. Two bodyguards.

315
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,960
They're nearly up.

316
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,936
And look at what I've done here.

317
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,960
Now, the necklace...

318
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,936
Where do you want it?

319
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,960
Just on the table over there.

320
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,136
Yeah, I see it. It's gonna
come down here. And

321
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,936
I would love for the... Yes.

322
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,936
Joshis are in position.

323
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,776
The necklace is on the table.

324
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,960
One cpo outside the
suite, another inside.

325
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,976
Back straight, smile wide,
and whatever you do...

326
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,936
Do not be yourself.

327
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,960
'Just open the door.'

328
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,936
Good afternoon, sir.
Compliments of the house.

329
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,960
Champagne and macarons.

330
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,936
Good luck with her. Yes, sir.

331
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,960
Room service coming up.

332
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,936
Perhaps the master bedroom?

333
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,960
Who's that?

334
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,936
Champagne and macarons, madam.

335
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,936
Compliments of the hotel. Reshmi scoffs

336
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,960
shall I send him away?

337
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,976
What flavour?

338
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,960
Pistachio, ma'am.

339
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,936
Stick 'em in there.

340
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,960
Maybe later. Reshmi chuckles.

341
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,960
Ready?

342
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,960
Now.

343
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,320
Alarm ringing faintly

344
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,936
alarm blaring really?

345
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,960
Come in?

346
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,960
You need to leave, now.

347
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,960
Cpos, you're hearing that, right?

348
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,936
Get reshmi out, leave the
necklace upstairs for the courier.

349
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,936
Suite doors will lock behind you, anyway.

350
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,936
The courier has a key card. He's
coming up to protect the package.

351
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,936
Phone ringing Roger that, chandra.

352
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,937
Reshmi scoffs yes?

353
00:29:44,961 --> 00:29:46,936
'Good afternoon, madam.
It's the management.'

354
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,616
is this a drill? I'm afraid not.

355
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,936
Please evacuate immediately.

356
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,960
I apologise for any
inconvenience caused.

357
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,480
Alarm continues

358
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,160
what on earth is going on?

359
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,976
Phone chimes god.

360
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,936
Problem? Alison.

361
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,936
She's... she's at the
hotel. For fuck's sake.

362
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,960
Tell her to leave. She
needs to stay out of this.

363
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,960
Phone buzzes.

364
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,937
Listen to me.

365
00:31:01,961 --> 00:31:03,936
There's a robbery that is happening now.

366
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,936
No, madam. This is a fire alarm.

367
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,936
It's a robbery. They're using the cctv.

368
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,456
My god! What is going
on? Let's keep moving.

369
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,960
Reshmi coughs.

370
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,936
Wait outside, please.

371
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,136
No, no, no!

372
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,640
They want everyone to get out
so they can take the necklace.

373
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,936
They're clear. They're clear.

374
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,960
Alarm blaring

375
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,960
'switch the necklaces.'

376
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,936
Keep moving, madam.

377
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,936
Wait. I need my necklace.
You have to go back and get it.

378
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,976
Chandra said it was safest in the room.

379
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,936
I don't give a fuck what she said!

380
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,616
I'm telling you to go back and get it.

381
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,160
I'm not leaving without it.

382
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,960
Bag secure. Coming down.

383
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,960
Fuck! The cpo is coming back.

384
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,960
Hide! What?!

385
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,776
I'm in the suite.

386
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,456
I'm not waiting for him.

387
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,960
It's full of smoke.

388
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,936
Computer chirping we've got a problem.

389
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,936
I can't open the door to the linen room.

390
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,960
'My remote access isn't
working.' Well, get it working.

391
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,936
'The fire alarm must
have triggered something.'

392
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,616
we haven't got time for this.

393
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,936
'You can't go down the main
stairs, the joshis are there.

394
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,616
'If they check the replica,
they'll suspect you.' What?!

395
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,936
You can't get caught
with the jewels on you.

396
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,936
You're gonna have to dump them.

397
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,296
There's a laundry chute on
the other side of the staircase.

398
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,960
'Put them in there, and we'll
collect them at the bottom.

399
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,960
'Put the jewels in the laundry chute!'

400
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,136
Ok, it's done.

401
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:58,160
Now get in here and get me out!

402
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,960
Heavy breathing.

403
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,936
I'm going in. I've gotta go!

404
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,296
Sir, thank you. Do you
know the way to go?

405
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,960
If you wouldn't mind, thank you so much.

406
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,960
Liam, where are you?
I can't stay here, can I?

407
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,000
Muffled chatter, guests clamouring.

408
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,936
I'm coming! Coming.
Just... just wait, I'm coming.

409
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,960
Alison! Alison!

410
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,960
Liam...

411
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,960
Alarm ringing.

412
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,936
Man coughs, handbrake clicks fuck.

413
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,936
Thank you so much for your Patience.

414
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,936
Guests clamouring yeah,
I'm really sorry, madam.

415
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,937
Phone buzzes Ben?

416
00:35:33,961 --> 00:35:36,936
Something's going on at
the hotel. They're evacuating.

417
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,937
Ok, we've just got a text from Alison.

418
00:35:37,961 --> 00:35:39,936
She said she's at the
hotel. Can you see her?

419
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,456
No. 'We need to know she's safe.'

420
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,976
'she might be inside. I'll check.'

421
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,936
armed response are on their way, Ben.

422
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,976
They're six minutes off, ok?

423
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,960
No, no, no. I'll take
a look. I'll be careful.

424
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,936
Stop this before it's too late,
ok? The police is on their way.

425
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,960
Funny you're here, too.

426
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,936
Look, they've got guns.
And Braden's got a gun, too.

427
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,800
Which is why you need to
get out before you fuck this up!

428
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,960
Ok, let's go.

429
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,960
Sighs screw this.

430
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,936
Braden! Stop!

431
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,937
Police!

432
00:36:39,961 --> 00:36:43,960
Alison yelps, supressed gunshots argh!

433
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,936
Alison whimpers can you get off me?!

434
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,160
Liam grunts, Ben groans.

435
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,960
Alison whimpers, sobs.

436
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,936
Ben, Ben! Just stay... stay with me.

437
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,936
Stay with me. Ben gasping
Alison sobbing please!

438
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,960
Can you call the ambulance?

439
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,960
Don't just stand there, do something!

440
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,937
Please.

441
00:37:14,961 --> 00:37:16,936
Ben groaning I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Alison.

442
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,320
I-I'm sorry.

443
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,776
Ben... sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

444
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,960
Just hold on, all right?

445
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:34,960
Ringing fades sound muted.

446
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,000
Gunshot.

447
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:45,960
Ben gasps groans in
pain high-pitched ringing

448
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:53,936
door slams I'm sorry. I'm
sorry, Alison. I-I'm sorry.

449
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,480
Alison sobbing Ben. Ben, Ben! Help...

450
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,960
Low hum of conversation.

451
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,936
'As this interview is under caution,

452
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,936
'we've provided a bsl interpreter.

453
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,960
'It's very important
that you understand us.'

454
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,960
DC lawford was shot.

455
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,960
One of Amir joshi's
bodyguards was killed.

456
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,960
I was there. I saw it.

457
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,960
You'll appreciate why it's
important for us to understand...

458
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,160
Do you want to tell us how
you came to be at the hotel?

459
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,616
He sighs softly.

460
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,960
I-I went there to try and stop the robbery.

461
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,960
Right.

462
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,296
And how long have you known

463
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,936
that the robbery was
gonna be at the hotel?

464
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,000
I didn't know. I... I guessed.

465
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,640
You guessed?

466
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,960
I mean...

467
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,800
You can see why I might have
difficulty believing that, yeah?

468
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:08,936
I mean, you stayed at the
hawthorne hotel with Liam...

469
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:09,960
Two days ago.

470
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,616
I mean, you stayed
in the exact same suite

471
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,960
that the robbery took place in.

472
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,936
I texted Ashleigh.

473
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,936
I told you it was gonna be at the hotel.

474
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,296
And a couple of hours before,
you told me it was at the vault.

475
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,936
But... You gave me false information,

476
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,936
which meant we
couldn't stop the robbery.

477
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,936
I didn't give you false information.
You see, DC lawford is in surgery.

478
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,936
He's having a bullet
removed from his abdomen.

479
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,960
So I need to understand, quickly.

480
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,936
Why you changed your story.

481
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,936
Did you get cold feet?

482
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,936
Did you and Liam fall out? What was it?

483
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,936
No, no. Liam told me that
it was gonna be at the vault.

484
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,960
That's what he said. Right.

485
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,960
Why would he say that if it wasn't true?

486
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,936
Liam found out I was working with you.

487
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,936
And I think he was listening
into our conversations

488
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,960
through my hearing aids.

489
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,480
Through your hearing aids?

490
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,960
Sorry, is that even...
Is that even possible?

491
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,960
What... what... What makes
you think he hacked you?

492
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,936
Well, he was asking
me about my hearing aids

493
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:23,616
and how... How they worked, you know?

494
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,936
And I found out my hearing
aids were paired up to my phone.

495
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,960
And I didn't set that up.

496
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,160
Ok. So... you think that Liam
used you to misdirect us?

497
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,960
Yeah, I think...

498
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,960
And you were never
tempted to help him?

499
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,960
Yeah, I was...

500
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,936
At times, I was tempted by him.

501
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,960
But that's because he
knew I was struggling.

502
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,960
But... I couldn't do it.

503
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,936
Because the more I
learnt being with you guys,

504
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,936
the more I realised that people

505
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,936
really do get hurt. And

506
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,936
I really didn't want that
to happen to anyone.

507
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,936
I really didn't.

508
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,160
Do you know where Liam is now?

509
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,936
What he's...? He's not...?

510
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,960
Did you not arrest him at the hotel?

511
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,960
Braden escaped in the Van.

512
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,160
Antony's in custody,
but he's saying nothing.

513
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,960
We didn't find Liam at the hotel.

514
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,960
We didn't find the jewels, either.

515
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,040
But here's what we do know.

516
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,960
Someone shut down the hotel cctv.

517
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,960
Right before DC lawford got shot.

518
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,160
I think that was Liam.

519
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:21,960
I think... Liam always
intended to escape on his own.

520
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,800
He planned it.

521
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,960
So he tricked...

522
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,480
He tricked the gang, and
then he used me to do it.

523
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,480
Sniffles.

524
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,936
DC lawford put himself
on the line for the job.

525
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:57,937
Let's make sure that wasn't for nothing.

526
00:44:57,961 --> 00:45:01,936
Let's put all our efforts into
finding Braden and Liam.

527
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,936
We're not gonna let
them walk away this time.

528
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,936
So, everything that I did
and all the risks that I took,

529
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:07,937
they were for nothing?

530
00:45:07,961 --> 00:45:09,936
Should've listened to you about Alison.

531
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:10,960
She was over-involved.

532
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,936

533
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:16,936
'you don't feel so clever now, do you?'

534
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,936
'what have you done?'

535
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,960
