1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,136
It's Alison.

2
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:03,936
She says the robbery's happening
at the hawthorne estate hotel.

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,456
'Back straight, smile wide.'

4
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,936
whatever you do, do not be yourself.

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,936
'Just open the door.'

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,456
she's at the hotel. Tell her to leave.

7
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,936
She needs to stay out of this.

8
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,936
'Necklace has changed
hands. Two bodyguards.'

9
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:14,960
now. Device beeps

10
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,936
alarm ringing Alison!

11
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,936
Liam... Braden. Stop! Argh!

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,937
You know where Liam is now?

13
00:00:23,961 --> 00:00:25,480
Did you not arrest him at the hotel?

14
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,960
Exhales.

15
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,936
Any news on Ben yet, Nia?

16
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,960
I'll call again, sir. Thanks.

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,320
Yeah.

18
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,960
Monitor beeping, ventilator hissing.

19
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,936
Braden can't be in Glasgow and
Plymouth at the same time, can he?

20
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,456
So can we just try and work out
which is the more credible sighting?

21
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,936
Thank you.

22
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,960
Ashleigh sighs

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,976
you should go home. Get some sleep.

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,960
No, I'm fine. I'm ok. I
wanna... I really wanna be here.

25
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,000
How are you?

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,936
Spoke to the bodyguard's
family. You know.

27
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,960
It's not your fault. You did
everything that you could.

28
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,936
Any leads on the phones?

29
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,936
No, we've had, hundreds
of calls since the appeal,

30
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,936
but it's just wishful thinking.

31
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,936
And the joshi team have been
on the phone, asking for updates.

32
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,937
Again. You?

33
00:02:35,961 --> 00:02:39,936
I spoke to Interpol, europol. Nothing.

34
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,960
Should've listened to you
about Alison, shouldn't I?

35
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,960
She was over-involved.

36
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,936
What's Antony saying? Anything yet?

37
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,936
No, Antony is saying no
comment, all through the night.

38
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,936
It's really fun. Helen
has coached him well.

39
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,936
Yeah. Sure she has.

40
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,616
She'd have paid him off
to keep quiet, do his time.

41
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,976
Just got off the phone with
Sara. She's at the hospital.

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,936
Ben's out of surgery.

43
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,936
He's not conscious yet, and we
won't know anything for a few hours.

44
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,936
My god.

45
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,960
Ok.

46
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,776
Ok, everyone.

47
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,960
Er.

48
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,936
DC lawford put himself on
the line for the job yesterday.

49
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,960
Put the safety of
others ahead of himself.

50
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,080
Let's make sure that wasn't for nothing.

51
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,480
Let's put all our efforts into
finding Braden and Liam.

52
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,136
We're not gonna let
them walk away this time.

53
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,936
God, Alison's mum is still
here. She's wants to see her.

54
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,960
Sure.

55
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,960
Alison sobs gently.

56
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,960
Hello.

57
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,936
This is Julie, my mum.

58
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,936
Hi, Julie. I'm James. Hi.

59
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,936
Ashleigh. Hi.

60
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,936
Ashleigh is gonna help find
you somewhere safe to stay

61
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,960
while we find Braden.

62
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,936
Does that mean we're
not going home? No. No.

63
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,936
Not yet. Not yet, ok?

64
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,960
But I can send someone to collect
anything you need, if that helps?

65
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,760
Can I... Can I have a
quick word with Alison?

66
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,936
Got a favour to ask. Is
there any news on Ben?

67
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,936
Yeah. Yes, yeah. Ben...
Ben's out of surgery.

68
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,320
He's still unconscious, but he's stable.

69
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,936
Ok, I can't give you your phone back,

70
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,776
but we were wondering...

71
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,936
If you might be able to
send Liam a message.

72
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,936
Ok, it's not like he's gonna reply,
but if he checks his messages,

73
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,936
that might help us to locate where he is.

74
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,937
Is that ok?

75
00:05:31,961 --> 00:05:33,936
And what should I say?

76
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,296
Just keep it simple.

77
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,936
Just ask him to let
you know he's ok. Yeah.

78
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,160
Ok.

79
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,776
That?

80
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,936
Great. Yeah, that's great.

81
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,936
Thanks, Alison. Thank you. Thank you.

82
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,936
The... the information I gave you,

83
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,936
is it enough to arrest Helen and Joseph?

84
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,936
We're bringing Helen and
Joseph in for questioning.

85
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,960
One step at a time.

86
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,960
So you're interviewing them? Yeah.

87
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,480
Can I be with mum? Yeah.

88
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,960
Knock on door

89
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,800
rapid knocking

90
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,960
Braden? Yeah.

91
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,936
Braden, what are you doing
here? You're all over the news.

92
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,936
Look, Danny would want you to help me.

93
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,936
If the police come here, I'm
telling 'em you threatened me.

94
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,136
He sighs what a mess.

95
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,936
Yeah.

96
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,936
It was the kid. He exhales
Liam Barlow. Liam?

97
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,936
What'd he do?

98
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,936
He convinced me we were
gonna stitch up the police,

99
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,456
but it was me that got played.

100
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,456
Exhales sharply your
Danny recommended him.

101
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,296
Well, someone informed on
Danny for that ransomware gig.

102
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,936
And you think it was Liam?

103
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,936
It opened up a vacancy, innit?

104
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,960
For some slippery little
mancunian fucker to step into.

105
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,960
You sure no-one followed you?

106
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,936
So, Oliver's gonna stay with you.

107
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,937
There's stuff in the kitchen,

108
00:07:54,961 --> 00:07:57,041
but if there's anything
you need, just let him know.

109
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,960
Yeah.

110
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,960
Ok.

111
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,960
No, thank you. No, I'm fine. Thank you.

112
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,136
Alison? I should get back.

113
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,000
I'll check the back doors. Ok.

114
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,320
You should get some rest. You
must be completely exhausted.

115
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,296
Have you spoken to Mark?

116
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,936
Because Helen and
Joseph came to the pub,

117
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,776
so he might know something.

118
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,976
We are speaking to him, but just

119
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,960
I know that it's hard, but you
do need to let us do our jobs, ok?

120
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,960
Can... can I go and see Ben?

121
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,960
I don't think that's a good idea.
He's only just got out of surgery.

122
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,776
It's just... I need to do something.

123
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,960
Please.

124
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,000
Sara?

125
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,960
How are you doing?

126
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,800
You brought her?

127
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,080
We're just here to drop
off some flowers, that's all.

128
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,960
Sara, I'm... I'm sorry.

129
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,136
Do you honestly think that you can just...

130
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,960
Show up with flowers
and everything'll be ok?

131
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,936
You shouldn't be here. It's...
It's already way too complicated.

132
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,296
I... I was trying to help. I was

133
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,936
I was trying to stop the robbery.

134
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,960
You slept with one of the suspects!

135
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,936
Was that... Was that part of your plan?

136
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,936
Ok.

137
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,000
We should go. Come on.

138
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,960
If you had just done what you were told.

139
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,936
And waited outside, Ben would've...

140
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,400
He'd have waited for armed response.

141
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,960
He wouldn't be in there.

142
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,960
I know.

143
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,960
Any more activity, let us know.

144
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,936
Sir. Yeah?

145
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,936
Liam's phone was switched
on. It pinged a tower in Budapest.

146
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,960
In Budapest?

147
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,936
You don't buy it?

148
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,960
He scoffs

149
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,936
why is someone as tech savvy as Liam

150
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,960
letting us track where he is?

151
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,960
Keyboard clacking.

152
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,960
Computer chirps, beeps.

153
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,960
Ready? Let's do it.

154
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,960
Device beeps

155
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,936
interview commences at 11:17am.

156
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,936
My client would like to make a statement.

157
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,936
Right, well, we've got some
questions we wanna ask you, Helen.

158
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,960
I've advised my client not to
answer any questions at this stage.

159
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,936
I want to start by saying that I'm shocked

160
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,320
by what happened at the hotel.

161
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:46,456
My heart goes out to the
family of the bodyguard who died

162
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,160
and to the police officer who was injured.

163
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,960
Braden Moore is an associate
of my estranged husband.

164
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,936
He got in contact with
me, wanting to get involved

165
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,960
in some property deals that I'm planning.

166
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,936
I made it clear that I did not
want to associate with him.

167
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,936
'I've known Helen red man for years.'

168
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,936
we reconnected recently
when she expressed an interest

169
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,936
in investing in one of my
property developments.

170
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,936
And I introduced her to
another business associate,

171
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,136
chandra bakshi.

172
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,960
Why are... Why are you
protecting her, Joseph?

173
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,136
I was introduced to
Braden Moore at the ice rink.

174
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,936
If I'd had any knowledge
of what he was planning,

175
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,936
of course, I would've reported it
to my employer and to the police.

176
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,936
If Braden somehow got
the idea to take the necklace

177
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:39,456
when he met miss bakshi, it
was wholly without my knowledge.

178
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,960
Paper rustles

179
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,800
that's all I've got to say.

180
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,296
Should we wrap up there?

181
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,160
Unless you have evidence to charge?

182
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,960
Not yet. But, er...

183
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,160
You spoken to Liam's girlfriend, Alison?

184
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,937
Why do you ask?

185
00:13:00,961 --> 00:13:04,960
Lovely girl. Thought she
might know something.

186
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:10,456
But then, of course, juries
might not rate her as a witness...

187
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,936
On account of her being deaf.

188
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,960
So easy for her to misunderstand.

189
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,960
And you know what
barristers can be like.

190
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,960
Ruthless.

191
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,960
Door opens, closes

192
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,936
all our evidence for conspiracy

193
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,936
is on a hit for the vault, not the hotel.

194
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,776
They've covered every angle.

195
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,936
They've got all their stories lined up.

196
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,936
Phone buzzes better
to let them run for now.

197
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,936
Gives us time to build
a stronger case, no?

198
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,960
Yes?

199
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,960
Is that confirmed?

200
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,960
Ok. Thanks.

201
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,936
We just had a confirmed
sighting of Braden.

202
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,456
He is still in Kent.

203
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,936
He's somewhere near
faversham, apparently.

204
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,936
He could be at Danny
Heath's place. Danny Heath's.

205
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,721
Let's get an armed unit down there,
and let's get you down there too.

206
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,960
Alison sighs.

207
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,960
Yeah.

208
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,480
That's the records you asked for.

209
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,936
Fostering records
from Manchester. Right.

210
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,936
Not many match the
criteria you gave me.

211
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,960
I think this is him. Thanks, Nia.

212
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,960
Inhales sharply.

213
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,936
'He's not here.'

214
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,296
the team have been
through the whole house.

215
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,136
But Molly does admit
that Braden was here.

216
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,936
Any idea which way he was headed?

217
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,937
'No. She claims to have no idea.

218
00:16:44,961 --> 00:16:46,936
'Says that he threatened to kill her.'

219
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,976
said that she was too shaken
up to call it in after he left.

220
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,616
'Ok. Bring her in.'

221
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,960
I'll be back soon, ok?

222
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,136
Let's go.

223
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,960
We've had to release Helen and Joseph.

224
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,936
You can't charge them?

225
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,936
They're blaming it all
on Liam and Braden,

226
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,936
saying they planned it alone.

227
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:13,936
But what about the evidence
that I have given to you?

228
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,936
The information you
gave us was very helpful,

229
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,456
but it wouldn't stand up in court.

230
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,320
Lawyers would just exploit
how you came to be on the case.

231
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,936
And, of course, your
relationship with Liam.

232
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,936
Which would undermine
all your evidence.

233
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,936
So everything that I did
and all the risks that I took,

234
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,960
what, they're all for nothing?

235
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,456
What did Mark say?

236
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,776
I bet he knows something.
Mark's not said anything.

237
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,480
Frankly, I think he's a bit scared.

238
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,936
Did Liam ever talk to you
about his time in foster care?

239
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,960
In foster care? Yeah. What did he say?

240
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,936
There was just one
family that he really liked.

241
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,936
Go on. But the man died
a couple of years ago.

242
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,040
Right. That's what he said?

243
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,296
Yeah. Why do want...?

244
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,160
We've been trying to
find out who that man is.

245
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,936
We know that Liam
came from Manchester

246
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,936
and he came from foster care.

247
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,936
Yeah.

248
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,936
But we can find no trace of
Liam Barlow before five years ago.

249
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,936
We did, however, find a Liam gray.

250
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,136
Fostered by a family in Manchester.

251
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,936
He's the right age,
matches Liam's description.

252
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,937
So he changed his name?

253
00:18:27,961 --> 00:18:30,960
Alison, did Liam ever show
you a picture of this man?

254
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,480
His name's Charlie Fletcher.

255
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,960
That's the man that Alfie killed.

256
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,936
That is Liam's ring.

257
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,936
He said that he actually got
that ring from his foster dad.

258
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,960
Charlie was Liam's foster father.

259
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,296
And none of this is a coincidence.

260
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,936
Are you saying that
Liam took the necklace

261
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,960
for revenge for Charlie?

262
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,640
Car beeps, unlocks.

263
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,960
Door closes, she sighs

264
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,936
you hungry again? This
was dropped off for you.

265
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,640
No, I didn't order that.
You didn't order this?

266
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,936
Actually, yeah, I did. Sorry, I forgot.

267
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,936
I ordered that for mum. I'll take it.

268
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,960
Ok. Thank you.

269
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,960
Inhales sharply.

270
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,960
Breathes shakily.

271
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,960
Alison. How did you find me?

272
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,936
I put a tracker on that
cop's car, ds Francis.

273
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,000
You lied to me.

274
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,936
You told me that no-one
was gonna get hurt.

275
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,936
That wasn't supposed to
happen. Braden promised me.

276
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,960
And you believed Braden?

277
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,160
He sighs I know.

278
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,936
Did you use my hearing
aids to spy on me

279
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,960
and listen in to my conversations?

280
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,616
I'm sorry.

281
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,960
Do you not know how fucked
up that is? How invasive?

282
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,936
My hearing aid is like a part of
me. I thought you understood that.

283
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,936
Alison, you slept with me so
that you could inform on me.

284
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,136
That's fucked up.

285
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,936
No, I slept with you because I liked you.

286
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,936
No. No, no, no, no. You betrayed me!

287
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,936
Did you engineer our first meeting? No!

288
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,776
The crash on your bike?

289
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,936
That was an accident. I didn't know you!

290
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,960
But you got to know me,
and you didn't stop informing.

291
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,936
He sighs it made you feel important.

292
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,937
Yeah.

293
00:22:27,961 --> 00:22:31,616
I was, because somebody
was listening to me

294
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,640
for the first time ever!

295
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,960
I know Charlie was your foster dad.

296
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,960
Is that why you took the necklace?

297
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,960
Money's the only thing that
Helen and Braden care about.

298
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,960
That was the only way to hurt them.

299
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,960
You really care about Charlie?

300
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,960
He sniffs yeah.

301
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,776
And I care about you.
That's why I came back.

302
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,936
Come away with me. We can still do it.

303
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,936
I've got a buyer for the
necklace in Panama.

304
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,936
He's gonna pay $5 million in cash.

305
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,976
No! What kind of life have you got here?

306
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,936
You're about to be
kicked out of your house,

307
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,936
and I meant everything that I
said about bringing your mum.

308
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,936
You could go to the police,

309
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,936
and you could testify
against Helen and Joseph.

310
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,936
We've still got a chance
to make things right.

311
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,960
No.

312
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,136
No.

313
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,936
I'll go to prison for a very long time.

314
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,937
And I've got a plan.

315
00:23:51,961 --> 00:23:53,936
A private plane will take us to Belgium,

316
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,936
and then we'll catch a plane to Brazil.

317
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,936
And no-one will find us there.

318
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,160
I like you. I really do.

319
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,976
But I don't

320
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,960
I'm not really sure if I know who you are.

321
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,960
You know me.

322
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,960
When we were in my flat, at the hotel.

323
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,936
That was real.

324
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,296
It could've been real.

325
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,960
But you completely fucked it up.

326
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,936
No. We both did stuff wrong.

327
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,976
And I am sorry. I am so sorry.

328
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,936
But we're on the same side.

329
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,936
We both wanted the same
thing - to stop Helen and Braden.

330
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,000
No. If you wanted to stop
them, you'd go to the police.

331
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,000
He sighs I can't.

332
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,960
And by the time you
call them, I'll be gone.

333
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,960
I can't go with you.

334
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,960
I can't go with you.

335
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,320
And if you're going, then.

336
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,960
Then maybe we should say goodbye.

337
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,960
So that's it?

338
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,960
We just walk away? No.

339
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,320
Good luck. No.

340
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,960
He sighs.

341
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,960
Doorbell rings

342
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,937
hi, dawn.

343
00:26:01,961 --> 00:26:03,136
James.

344
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,936
Can I come in?

345
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,960
Yeah.

346
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,456
I've got a little boy arriving tomorrow.

347
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,936
Five years old.

348
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,960
Mum's in rehab, dad's
never been around.

349
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,960
Liam Barlow. Sound familiar to you?

350
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,616
Er, no. I was...

351
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,480
It's just he was one of your foster kids.

352
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,240
I think he was with you in 2012.

353
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,800
Changed his name since
then, I think. Nothing?

354
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,936
I've got a... a picture of him.

355
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,960
He chuckles that's him.

356
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,960
Have a look at that.

357
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,936
Honestly don't recognise
him. No, nothing?

358
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,936
There were so many kids over the years.

359
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,960
And I was working back then, so
Charlie did most of the foster care.

360
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,960
He sighs

361
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,936
we're friends, aren't we, dawn?

362
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,960
Yeah. Of course.

363
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,936
I mean, I could get a warrant
to search the place, if you like.

364
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,480
Or you can just tell me what you know.

365
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,000
Clock's ticking.

366
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,160
Liam was Charlie's favourite.

367
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,976
The only one he stayed in
touch with right up until he died.

368
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,936
But he's a good lad, James.

369
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,936
Is he? Is he? He's a good
kid, is he? Right, yeah.

370
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,936
Why don't you tell that to my colleague

371
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,616
who's just spent four hours in surgery,

372
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,936
having a bullet removed from his spleen?

373
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,936
Liam didn't pull the trigger.

374
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,936
Did he not?

375
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,936
So that makes everything ok, does it?

376
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,456
You think the same about Braden
not pulling the trigger on Charlie?

377
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,456
Does that make him
blame-free as well? I mean...

378
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,936
Or is this some kind
of rough-justice thing

379
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,937
against Braden and Helen?

380
00:28:13,961 --> 00:28:14,976
I didn't know what he was planning.

381
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,480
I would've stopped
him. Of course I would!

382
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,296
I don't know where he is.

383
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,480
Dawn...

384
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,960
Dawn exhales James sighs

385
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,136
'you got anything?'
Liam's definitely been here.

386
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,936
I'll fill you in on the details later,

387
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,136
but dawn's not giving him up. 'Ok.'

388
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,976
we've just had a report of a
carjacking just outside ashford.

389
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,936
Description matches Braden.

390
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,937
We tracing that car?

391
00:28:44,961 --> 00:28:47,936
'It pinged the anpr just outside
canterbury. Nothing since then.'

392
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,936
I think he's probably
staying off main roads.

393
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,960
Tyres screech.

394
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,960
Everything ok?

395
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,936
Gone. Gone.

396
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,936
'You really shouldn't be here, Alison.'

397
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,936
I know, but have you
spoken to the police?

398
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,960
Yeah. I don't think I was much help.

399
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,936
I have been working with them.

400
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:39,976
I came here because you're
the only one who can help now.

401
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,936
The detectives think I
don't have enough evidence,

402
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,936
and I need someone
else to stand up to them.

403
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,936
They would protect
you. No, I'm sorry, Alison.

404
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,936
You don't cross people like Braden.

405
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,480
I really am sorry, Alison.

406
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,960
Footsteps approach slowly hello, Alison.

407
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,960
Phone buzzes.

408
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,936
Alison sobbing 'hey, hey, manc.

409
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,937
'Look who I ran into.'

410
00:30:19,961 --> 00:30:23,960
Alison whimpers, cries

411
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,800
breathes heavily.

412
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,480
Mrs Brooks.

413
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,480
Thank you.

414
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,960
Keys jingle.

415
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,960
Dawn gasps Liam.

416
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,960
Alison grunts

417
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,960
come here!

418
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,960
Braden grunts

419
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,960
now...

420
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,616
We're gonna see how much your
boyfriend really cares about you.

421
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,936
The police will find you.

422
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,936
They will be looking for you right now.

423
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,960
He chuckles.

424
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,000
I knew there was something about you.

425
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,936
You're always watching.

426
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,960
How long you been ratting?

427
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,960
Since the very start.

428
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,960
Well...

429
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,640
Well...

430
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:17,960
You don't feel so clever now, do you?

431
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,936
How could you be so stupid?

432
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,480
Alfie's gonna be out in a few years.

433
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,960
That's not justice.

434
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,936
I did this for Charlie... For you.

435
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,960
I never meant for you to do this.

436
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,936
I wanted to take something from them,

437
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,640
the way they took Charlie from us.

438
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,960
Braden contacted me. He's got Alison.

439
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,936
I'm gonna get her back.

440
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:53,800
Helen's gonna meet
me... Take me to Alison.

441
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,280
I just got to give them the necklace.

442
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,640
Then what?

443
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,800
Then when... once Alison's
safe, I'll get on the plane.

444
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,800
I'll manage somehow.

445
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,000
I just wanted to see you.

446
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,960
Say goodbye.

447
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,936
So you'll spend your life on the run?

448
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,960
I don't have a choice.

449
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,936
You could still do the
right thing. Go to the police!

450
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,480
No. Just promise me
you won't call them.

451
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,456
Braden'll kill her.

452
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,320
He's got nothing to lose now. He'll do it.

453
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,960
How do you know he won't kill you?

454
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,960
Come here.

455
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,960
She sobs gently

456
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,936
ok, everyone, I want us to circulate

457
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,936
descriptions of Liam and Alison
to bus stations, train stations.

458
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,936
Let's go ports, airports. Let's
check private airfields, too.

459
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,936
They're likely to be more noticeable
as a couple than they are alone.

460
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,960
Ok? Let's get on it.

461
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,480
Where's Liam? Where could he be?

462
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,960
Liam. Can't say it's good to see you.

463
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,960
I'm alone, like you said.

464
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,960
Where's Alison?

465
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,000
Have you got the necklace?

466
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,960
I wanna see her first.

467
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,960
We'll go in my car.

468
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,960
Inside.

469
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,960
Braden?

470
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,937
Braden!

471
00:35:43,961 --> 00:35:45,960
Gun clicks whoa.

472
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,960
No sudden moves, ok?

473
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,936
He come on his own? He did.

474
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,136
And he's got the necklace.

475
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,936
Where's Alison?

476
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,936
I need to know that she's safe.

477
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:01,960
He chuckles see, I... I
always knew you were soft.

478
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,960
Here's your little police snitch.

479
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,936
Get up! Alison whimpers whoa, whoa.

480
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,936
Liam. Don't trust him.

481
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,937
Shut up!

482
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:14,960
He's not gonna let us go. Alison cries.

483
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,960
Danny Heath. Can
we just get on with this?

484
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,960
I tracked Danny down.

485
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,960
Got him to let me in
on the ransomware gig.

486
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,960
And I got him sent to prison for it.

487
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,936
All so I could meet Helen
red man and Braden Moore,

488
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,480
cos you killed Charlie.

489
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,960
That's what this is about?

490
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,960
You fucked up my gig
for Charlie Fletcher?

491
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,960
He might be nothing to
you... But he meant a lot to me.

492
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,936
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

493
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,960
Easy. I'm getting the necklace.

494
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,937
Let me see it.

495
00:37:02,961 --> 00:37:04,936
I'm gonna need you to
put that gun down first.

496
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,960
No chance, manc.

497
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,456
Now get out.

498
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,936
Alison yelps on your knees.

499
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,936
But you've got the necklace.

500
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,937
Why not let him go? Not your concern.

501
00:37:31,961 --> 00:37:35,936
On... your... knees.

502
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,937
No, no, no, no, no!

503
00:37:36,961 --> 00:37:38,936
No, no, please, no... Do what he says.

504
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,936
Please, don't do this,
please! Do what he says.

505
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,936
Just go. But you got what you wanted.

506
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,936
Get out! Alison, do what he says.

507
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,936
You got what you wanted.
Please don't hurt him.

508
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,960
Get out! Alison!

509
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,936
Please, go!

510
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,136
What you sticking around for?

511
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,936
You'll be next! Get out!

512
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,960
Please, go.

513
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,616
Officer, muffled: Armed
police! On your knees!

514
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,160
Stay where you are!

515
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,320
Officers clamouring.

516
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,960
Putting it down!

517
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,960
Clamouring continues

518
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,936
don't... don't shoot!

519
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,936
I'm putting it down!

520
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,136
- I got nothing!
- Stop resisting!

521
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,976
Stop resisting! Stay where you are!

522
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,960
Braden grunting, panting

523
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:44,936
Braden Moore... I'm
arresting you for murder,

524
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,936
armed robbery and attempted murder.

525
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,936
You don't have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence

526
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,976
if you do not mention when questioned

527
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,960
anything which you
may later rely on in court.

528
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,960
Officers chatter

529
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,960
got the suspect secured.
Get him in the car.

530
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,960
You ok?

531
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,960
We got Helen's admission
on tape, which is...

532
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,960
Thanks for getting in
contact. You did the right thing.

533
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,640
He was a good man,
was Charlie, wasn't he?

534
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,960
Liam clears throat, chuckles

535
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,960
is that why you did it? Was it all for him?

536
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,960
It was.

537
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,960
I'd believe you if you hadn't
run off with a £5 million necklace.

538
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,600
Look, Alison was just wondering
if she could have a word with him.

539
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,160
Yeah, she can have a minute. Yeah.

540
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,960
Thank you.

541
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,960
Are you ok?

542
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,960
Yeah.

543
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,960
You gave yourself up for me.

544
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,960
It was worth it.

545
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,960
Just so you know, I was
really tempted by your offer.

546
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,320
Next time?

547
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,480
I'm so sorry.

548
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,936
Just... I actually like working hard.

549
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,936
And all I ever wanted is for
people to give me a chance,

550
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,480
the same chance as anyone else.

551
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,960
All right, it's time to go.

552
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,960
Car door opens I'm sorry.

553
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,960
Engine starts.

554
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,960
She inhales, sighs

555
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,800
hi.

556
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,960
It's nice to see you. Yeah, you too.

557
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,000
Courtroom chatter

558
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,640
courtroom chatter.

559
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,960
All rise.

560
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,960
Case of Liam Barlow.

561
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,936
Are you Liam Barlow? Yes.

562
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:07,136
Liam Barlow, you are
charged with conspiracy to Rob

563
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,976
in that on or before 17th
September of this year,

564
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,976
together with Helen red man,
Braden Moore, Antony bates,

565
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,936
chandra bakshi and persons unknown,

566
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:21,936
you conspired to Rob
Amir joshi and others.

567
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,936
How do you plead?

568
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,160
Guilty or not guilty?

569
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,960
Guilty.

570
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,960
Footsteps approach

571
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:57,937
hello. James.

572
00:43:57,961 --> 00:43:59,936
Sorry, the... the door was open.

573
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:00,960
Yeah.

574
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,936
Moving out? Yeah. We're
moving into a new flat.

575
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,456
New start. Well, I hope

576
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,936
I hope you don't mind me coming round.

577
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:13,936
I just wanted to give you some
news. We've arrested Joseph holhurst.

578
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,976
Not connected to the
robbery, we couldn't do that.

579
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,936
But we had a good look
through his accounts,

580
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,296
and we managed to charge
him with money laundering.

581
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,960
So Hollis and byrne
have suspended him.

582
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,936
So it's not gonna make any difference

583
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,960
to us getting kicked out of here?

584
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,936
We also got news back
from the review board.

585
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:38,936
I didn't wanna say too much
until we knew the outcome,

586
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,960
but, you know, payments to
informants are based on results.

587
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,000
And thanks to you, we
made some pretty big arrests.

588
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,960
And it was your information that
led to the recovery of the necklace.

589
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,800
So...

590
00:44:58,960 --> 00:44:59,960
Paper rustling

591
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,160
£50,000?

592
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:11,936
Is this for me?

593
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:12,960
It is.

594
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:18,936
Thank you.

595
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,800
Well, don't thank me.
It was your hard work.

596
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,800
It's gonna really help.

597
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,960
Well, if you have anything left over.

598
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,400
You might wanna think about this.

599
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,960
With your skills.

600
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,800
I'm sure you'll be in demand.

601
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,160
