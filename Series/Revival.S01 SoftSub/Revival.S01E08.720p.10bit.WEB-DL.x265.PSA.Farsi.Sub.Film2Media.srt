1
00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:06,899
<i>Previously on revival.</i>

2
00:00:06,923 --> 00:00:08,651
Are these my black deer
files? <i>How did you get these?</i>

3
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,695
<i>The reason you were
shot is because you were</i>

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,613
- getting too close to the truth.
- When she first became a cop

5
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:14,281
she was on the black deer case.

6
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:16,575
The guy that killed his daughter?

7
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:18,160
<i>My gut says Aaron was
working with the person</i>

8
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:20,121
<i>who killed em, but Brent
was working for them.</i>

9
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:21,747
<i>Let's follow the evidence</i>
instead of your gut.

10
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:23,815
Stop throwing the
black deer case in my face!

11
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,797
- Hi, Dana.
- Jesse black deer?

12
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:31,674
<i>I think the real question is</i>

13
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,801
<i>why do we have the
same murder board?</i>

14
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:35,553
<i>Drinking it only gave
you temporary relief.</i>

15
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:36,762
<i>- Where's Ibrahim?
- Back at Moore creek.</i>

16
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:38,431
<i>I couldn't bring him with me.</i>

17
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:40,016
- Why not?
- It wasn't up to me.

18
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,352
<i>Martha is being hunted
and my soldiers</i> will find her.

19
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,271
<i>There's another way to draw her out.</i>

20
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:47,505
Families intertwined
and so are our stories.

21
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:53,136
Whoever killed me and my
Rose, they killed you, too.

22
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,747
Come on, you actually know dad.

23
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,415
He's gonna freak out
even though it's literally

24
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,459
a 15-minute bus ride away.

25
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,169
Your father knows how
important college is to you.

26
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,421
I think if you just break it to him gently,

27
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,405
he won't overreact.

28
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,366
Much.

29
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,678
Well, it's more than college.

30
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:19,555
Mom, it's about getting out of the house.

31
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,433
I need this and I really don't want to

32
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,852
have to worry about dad
just showing up on campus

33
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:27,688
and dragging me out of the dorms
because something went wrong.

34
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:29,673
He just worries about you.

35
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,425
Do you worry about me?

36
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,404
No.

37
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,782
No, you're my little miracle, em.

38
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:41,768
You are the strongest,
most amazing person I know.

39
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,872
Dad, I'm working.

40
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:47,249
Can we talk about this later? Please?

41
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:49,585
Apparently you've had months
to tell me. There is no later.

42
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,379
I shouldn't have to
hear from your uncle Don

43
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:52,963
that you're leaving.

44
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:54,590
God, I can't believe uncle told on me.

45
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,467
How come you could tell
him about it, but not me?

46
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,302
I wanted to tell you,

47
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,221
but I knew this was going to happen.

48
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,807
- It's not a big deal.
- It is a big deal - to me.

49
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:05,267
Rose, after your mom,
you're all I got left.

50
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,729
That's not fair! This isn't about mom.

51
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:10,815
There's just nothing for me to do here.

52
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,341
This is about your mom, though.

53
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:16,278
If you leave, her land rights
go back to the government.

54
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,780
I know.

55
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,431
Uncle told me.

56
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,435
But maybe it's time to let that go.

57
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:26,455
Okay, mom doesn't live
through a stupid land contract.

58
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,039
What your mother left you isn't stupid!

59
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,484
- This is important! We need to...
- Dad!

60
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,154
Please, just go.

61
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,323
Okay, we'll talk about this later.

62
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,658
I promise.

63
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,967
I just wish he didn't
take it so personally.

64
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:51,272
I've always had to walk on eggshells

65
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,756
when it came to my mom.

66
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,759
He's never really gotten over it.

67
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,478
I don't really care
where we are, you know?

68
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,583
I mean, even this place is not that bad

69
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,275
'cause you're with me.

70
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,611
No, we're still going.

71
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,239
Sure.

72
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,134
But you want to give
your dad some time to, like,

73
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,596
cool down a bit. I mean,
there's no need to rush.

74
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,706
Tomorrow, I'm on the train to Chicago.

75
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:30,835
Okay, but what about all your stuff?

76
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,339
It's stuff.

77
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:38,468
We both loved that place.
Okay, it's perfect for us.

78
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,781
And if I don't go now and lock us in,

79
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,848
someone else is going
to come and rent it.

80
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:47,394
And that'll just give us
another reason not to do this.

81
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,872
And next thing you know, we'll be

82
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,731
stuck here until we're 50.

83
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:56,820
I just... I need to take this step.

84
00:03:57,696 --> 00:04:01,408
You, me, a shitty cat.

85
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,512
In the windy city.

86
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:08,456
I can smell the smog and the deep dish.

87
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,501
Deal?

88
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,216
Deal.

89
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,679
You knew we always had a deal.

90
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:45,702
God.

91
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,124
Hey!

92
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,712
Rose?

93
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,677
Where you going?

94
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,986
Rose.

95
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,466
Hey, what are you doing way out here?

96
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,576
Just passing through.
Where you headed?

97
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,455
The train station. Chicago bound!

98
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,083
You want a lift?

99
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,032
Officer cypress?

100
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,386
I see her. Don't worry. Hey, Dana.

101
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,595
- Sir.
- Just wanna talk to her.

102
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,013
Hey, stop.

103
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,682
- What are you doing?
- No.

104
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,183
Why aren't you guys looking
for my daughter? Dana.

105
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,018
- It's okay.
- No, no, no. No. Okay.

106
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,520
Brent, let him go.

107
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,063
Stay outta my way.

108
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,714
Please.

109
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,613
It's been 72 hours. Three days!

110
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,865
I know. This is bad.

111
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,742
We've alerted the authorities in Chicago

112
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,703
and at her first stop in Milwaukee.

113
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,567
Big city cops don't
care about a missing girl.

114
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:37,897
Especially one off the reservation.

115
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:40,692
- No one ever cares.
- That's not true. I care.

116
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:44,797
Jesse, you know that,
right? I'm your friend.

117
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,657
I'm-i'm... I'm not giving up on this.

118
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,428
Okay? I promise.

119
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,746
Dana, I'm telling you,
something happened to her.

120
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:54,748
I just.

121
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,601
I just feel it.

122
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,812
And every day and
every minute we waste,

123
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,022
we're not going to find her.

124
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:03,673
Dana, please. Please.

125
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,969
I'm not giving up.

126
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,934
Don't tell my dentist.

127
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,247
How'd you get it unstuck
from the spinny thingy?

128
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,249
I just gave it a little...!

129
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,858
You know? Fell right out.

130
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,047
I got them hip movements
down from the, from the bowling.

131
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:27,882
Good tip.

132
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:28,924
Let me know if you
want a square of this?

133
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,784
You know, if I eat the whole thing,

134
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:33,953
you don't want to see that.

135
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,582
Did you talk to the manager?

136
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,770
Yeah.

137
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,897
Yeah, so, you know how the neighbour

138
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:45,566
heard yelling and a
tussle, you know, that night.

139
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:49,570
Well, turns out the night before
Jesse came to see her at work

140
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,530
and he was yelling
right in front of everyone

141
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,783
about her going away and,

142
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,976
turns out Rose did buy a
ticket to Chicago, but she,

143
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,246
she never got on the bus.

144
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,123
And that ticket?

145
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,565
Never scanned.

146
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,651
Shit.

147
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:27,067
Hey, Brent, meet me at
the bus shelter off stetton.

148
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,653
I think our missing person
case just became a homicide.

149
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:50,965
- Hey.
- Hey, Jesse.

150
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:54,677
We're going to need
to search the premises.

151
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,765
All right, yeah...

152
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,186
Take you to her trailer.

153
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:06,856
We need to search the whole house.

154
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,168
And I'm going to need
you to wait out here

155
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,045
with the deputy while we do.

156
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,738
Dana, what's going on?

157
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,199
I'm sorry, Jesse.

158
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,668
Dana, you might want to see this.

159
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,397
What am I looking at?

160
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:14,591
It's a land ownership contract.
It's in the safe back there.

161
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:18,011
It's Rose's.

162
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:26,579
Why are you showing this to me?

163
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,039
This says that Rose's
land ownership rights

164
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:30,833
revert if she establishes
permanent residency

165
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,127
outside tribal lands.

166
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:34,879
Yeah, right, that's why I'm
so adamant about her staying.

167
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:36,672
I don't want her to lose this.

168
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,615
Yeah, or maybe you
don't want to lose this?

169
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:44,180
If she leaves, the land rights
revert to the government,

170
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,205
not you.

171
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,041
What are you saying?

172
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:52,170
It's motive, Jesse.

173
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:11,356
Hey, there, elder Don
George. Do you have a second?

174
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:14,234
You find her yet?

175
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,320
No, no yet.

176
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:21,050
I was told Rose notified the council

177
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,843
of her intent to relocate.

178
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,804
Well, she came to see
me a couple weeks back.

179
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:27,098
Why do you think she
kept it from her father?

180
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:29,850
Why do we all keep secrets
from our family, deputy?

181
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,852
Jesse is a proud man.

182
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:34,939
Protective of his family and our ways.

183
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:37,400
Was it all protective?

184
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:40,027
Doesn't he stand to lose a lot
if the land ownership defaults?

185
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:42,405
Jesse only did what's best for Rose.

186
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,281
That much I know.

187
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,033
You're a parent, no?

188
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:48,435
What would you give up for your child?

189
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:53,249
No, don't talk like that, ma. Okay?

190
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,792
No, you're going to be all right.

191
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,585
Yeah.

192
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,920
No, I gotta go, though.

193
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,779
I'm at work. Bye now.

194
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,049
How is she?

195
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:04,200
She's,

196
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,929
she's holding up best
she can, you know?

197
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:09,307
But my, but my little brother, it's,

198
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:10,808
hitting him something fierce.

199
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:12,935
Little brother? He's your twin.

200
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,980
I'm at least a movie
lengths older than him, Dana,

201
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:18,441
so that's gotta count
for something, right?

202
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:20,818
He's, he's trying to
pitch in with medical bills

203
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:22,862
right now and it's,

204
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:26,431
you know, my salary here
doesn't make it any easier.

205
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:30,911
So, did you find anything in the letters?

206
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:34,397
The, the bear letters. Yeah. Yeah.

207
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:36,292
What does that mean?

208
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,710
Well, they're all addressed to

209
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:40,129
this individual named bear, so,

210
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,131
sort of taken to calling them that.

211
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,823
Who the hell is bear?

212
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:02,151
Jeez!

213
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,855
You want to tell me what the hell that is?

214
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:06,906
It's an endangered form of print media

215
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,867
known as a newspaper.

216
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:11,911
You told the wausau chronicle

217
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:14,330
that Jesse black deer
is no longer a suspect.

218
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,540
Yeah. He's not. He's still
just a person of interest.

219
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,876
I mean, there's no physical
evidence tying him to this.

220
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,461
Really?

221
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,296
He was the last person to see her alive

222
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,256
and they had a public altercation.

223
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,425
Now, we're trying to
make a case here, Dana,

224
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:29,428
and you contradicting yourself
week to week in the press

225
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:31,555
is not helping anyone, okay?

226
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:34,976
So, if it's not him, then
who the hell is the suspect?

227
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,544
Well, I'm looking into
this person called bear.

228
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:40,690
No one seems to know who they are,

229
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:43,150
but they had been writing these
long rambling letters to Rose

230
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:44,902
for years. Look at this.

231
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:48,239
And-and the last one
was about her leaving

232
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:50,950
and something about them
seeing each other one more time.

233
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:53,852
It could be, a love thing.

234
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,372
So your suspect is the pen pal?

235
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,416
Where is the evidence?

236
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,167
I'm investigating, but
dad, my gut is telling me.

237
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:02,503
Jesse's not our guy.
Right now, all he's guilty of

238
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:04,505
is fighting with his daughter.
Does that sound familiar?

239
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:06,590
Despite your gut, we're
doing another search

240
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,950
of the black deer property tomorrow.

241
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:11,512
No. Come on, we've put
him through enough, dad.

242
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:13,931
Talk to Brent. He'll
tell you the same thing.

243
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:16,892
I did talk to Brent, by the
way, who agreed with me.

244
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,853
He said another search couldn't hurt.

245
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:21,939
Or, more properly,
couldn't hurt a tick on a fly.

246
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:23,381
Whatever the hell that means.

247
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:48,907
This...

248
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,988
Mountain bay county
sheriff's department.

249
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:35,662
Officer.

250
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:48,526
Where were you on November 5th?

251
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:51,636
Okay. So much for pleasantries?

252
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:55,432
November 5th.

253
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:00,621
I believe I was travelling.

254
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:03,457
Yeah. You travel a lot, officer...?

255
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:06,252
- Cypress.
- Cypress?

256
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:07,795
No! Come on.

257
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:09,529
Answer the question, Abel. Thanks.

258
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:13,634
Like I said, I was travelling, you know?

259
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:15,803
Collecting new experiences,

260
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:17,596
new perspectives. Getting out of the

261
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,164
where were you travelling?

262
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:22,852
Myrtle beach.

263
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:26,480
All right? I like to get out
of here when it gets cold.

264
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,256
Do you have proof?

265
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:31,861
Well, yeah, I'm sure I've got a receipt

266
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:33,612
of the plane ticket somewhere,
but you know, more importantly,

267
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:36,657
what are you even doing
here 'cause I can chat all day,

268
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:39,327
but chatting with a cypress?

269
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:41,746
Not really my thing.

270
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,481
So when I look up this receipt,
do I search for Blaine or bear?

271
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:50,403
And why would you say that?

272
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:53,656
I'm not the only one, am I?

273
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,368
Rose black deer.

274
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:58,578
She gave you that necklace, right?

275
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:01,831
A bear claw for her bear.

276
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,502
What did you give her?

277
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:09,940
Rose is special to me.

278
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:11,650
I'll bet.

279
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:14,403
No, no, no. Don't you do that, okay?

280
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,447
It is nothing like that.

281
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:18,449
She's one of the only
people that actually sees me,

282
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:20,534
who cares what I have to say.

283
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:22,703
You are twice her age and
you expect me to believe

284
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:25,289
that all you cared about was her writing?

285
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:28,459
I respect her. It's not like that.

286
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:29,960
What's it like?

287
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:32,213
<i>Dana, you there? Over.</i>

288
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:33,839
One minute, Jeannie.

289
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:36,217
<i>Sorry, Dana, but this is urgent.</i>

290
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:38,636
<i>They found something
at the black deer home.</i>

291
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,328
<i>You're going to want to see this.</i>

292
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,290
Copy.

293
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,186
I'll be back. We'll talk again.

294
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,396
Yeah.

295
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,672
Anytime.

296
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:57,738
I don't know how that got in there.

297
00:18:57,762 --> 00:18:59,365
Dana, you gotta believe me.

298
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:00,849
What the hell's going on?

299
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,602
It's over, Dana. Move on.

300
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:10,859
Dae... It's not good. It's Rose's shirt.

301
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:15,030
We'll take it for testing,
but, it was in the furnace.

302
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:19,534
Must've fallen down the side
when he, burned the body.

303
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:24,515
What? No! That doesn't make sense.

304
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,726
Brent, how-how could we
have missed something like that?

305
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,460
I'm sorry.

306
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:36,986
Hey.

307
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,678
I want a lawyer.

308
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:42,783
Jesse, I'm trying to help you.

309
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:45,477
Really? 'Cause this is
where your help's got me.

310
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:48,873
You want me in there?

311
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:50,374
- No. Absolutely not.
- Dana.

312
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:51,542
- Get out.
- I think I should, you know.

313
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:53,401
Brent, I got this.

314
00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:56,756
I got this. I'll let you
know if I need help.

315
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,448
All right.

316
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,745
These are too tight. I'm so sorry.

317
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,043
This is how you treat a murderer.

318
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:12,355
- Let me see if I can...
- no, I don't want

319
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:13,856
- anything else from you.
- Jesse.

320
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,775
No.

321
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:17,719
I shouldn't have trusted
you in the first place.

322
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:43,594
This entire department
is rotten to its core

323
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:45,179
and you know it!

324
00:20:45,203 --> 00:20:47,348
He was your friend! He trusted you!

325
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:49,976
Jesus. Okay. What? Is
there a question here?

326
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,645
Yeah. Was it your dad who
planted the evidence or you?

327
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:55,064
How desperate are you for a headline?

328
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:57,358
Question is how desperate
were all of you to close the case?

329
00:20:57,382 --> 00:20:59,694
Just pin it on the native
man. No one will blink an eye.

330
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:01,779
Some things never change!

331
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:03,656
Let's get you in here.

332
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,575
He was taking him to county
and got jumped in the car.

333
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:07,827
Blackdeer?

334
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:09,370
He's on the run.

335
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:11,479
Shit.

336
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:15,751
<i>What's the status on the
north quadrant search?</i>

337
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,294
<i>Negative on contact.</i>

338
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:19,380
<i>Shifting east into denser cover.</i>

339
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:22,008
<i>- Will advise if we spot any thin.
- Copy that.</i>

340
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:24,909
<i>No update yet on deputies
cypress and Rogers.</i>

341
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,596
<i>This is Rogers.</i>

342
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,765
<i>Dana has eyes on
black deer and is in pursuit.</i>

343
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,434
<i>Returning to her position now.</i>

344
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:35,295
Jesse! Jesse! Stop!

345
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:41,444
Please! You know I didn't do this!

346
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:43,178
Jesse, get your hands up!

347
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:46,473
No. I'm not going with you.

348
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:49,392
Come on, don't do this.

349
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:51,978
You're going to have to shoot me.

350
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:56,650
Jesse!

351
00:21:58,652 --> 00:22:00,362
My Rose is gone.

352
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:03,573
Let me go, too.

353
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:17,879
Thank you.

354
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:24,844
Dana!

355
00:22:27,931 --> 00:22:30,016
You let him go?

356
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:34,038
Visual confirmed, but he evaded.

357
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:35,522
We lost him.

358
00:22:37,816 --> 00:22:39,543
<i>Pinsconsin pride.</i>

359
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:42,380
12-year regional champions.

360
00:22:42,404 --> 00:22:45,049
And we've been to nationals twice.

361
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:47,051
I've been the team
captain for seven years.

362
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:49,428
Seven years? Wow.

363
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:51,555
And what about the rest of your team?

364
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:53,665
I mean, have they
always been the same.

365
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:59,337
We've got, Doreen, Paulie,
zeb, Brent and myself.

366
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:01,774
And that would be deputy Brent?

367
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:04,985
Yeah. He's our top striker.

368
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:08,346
We would've won nothing without him.

369
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:12,410
I mean, honestly, we'd be
celebrating a seven-year run

370
00:23:12,434 --> 00:23:15,061
if he hadn't missed the
championship two years ago.

371
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:19,000
Two years ago? Was that common?

372
00:23:19,024 --> 00:23:21,419
I mean, did he ever
miss any other matches or

373
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:26,007
no. No. He is dedicated to the cause.

374
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:27,925
I mean, yeah, even when he was

375
00:23:27,949 --> 00:23:30,761
sick as a dog that time he showed up.

376
00:23:30,785 --> 00:23:33,514
And are the championships
the same time every year?

377
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:36,517
Yes, ma'am. Third week of November.

378
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:38,376
Bowlers' Christmas.

379
00:23:39,377 --> 00:23:42,565
Third week of November. <i>The only game</i>

380
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:44,966
Brent ever missed
was on November 17th.

381
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:51,115
Which was one night
before he found Rose's shirt.

382
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:53,409
I don't follow.

383
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:54,702
He said he had food
poisoning and he had to sit out,

384
00:23:54,726 --> 00:23:56,871
but this was the first and only time

385
00:23:56,895 --> 00:23:58,956
he's ever done that.

386
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,541
This is the same guy who
won regionals the year prior

387
00:24:00,565 --> 00:24:02,627
while running a fever of 102.

388
00:24:02,651 --> 00:24:04,629
And Jesse's neighbours
said that they saw an officer

389
00:24:04,653 --> 00:24:08,365
at 8 P.M. at the time, but
they didn't think anything of it.

390
00:24:08,907 --> 00:24:11,076
But why didn't Jesse see them then?

391
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:14,537
It was a Thursday at around 8 P.M.

392
00:24:14,996 --> 00:24:16,748
He was at the tribal meeting.

393
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:19,769
And he knew that.

394
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:21,937
He had one window of
opportunity to plant the evidence

395
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:23,672
and he took it.

396
00:24:26,007 --> 00:24:28,736
He framed him.

397
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,013
I need to get to Jesse. Please.

398
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:38,478
See you later, Justin.

399
00:24:38,937 --> 00:24:40,605
Goodnight.

400
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,860
Jesse black deer?

401
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:49,447
It's okay. You're okay.

402
00:24:49,906 --> 00:24:51,592
You shouldn't be here.

403
00:24:51,616 --> 00:24:55,221
Jesse, or I can call you
Justin, if that's preferred.

404
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:57,038
You're that wausau reporter.

405
00:24:57,914 --> 00:24:59,600
Look, I ain't got nothing to say to you.

406
00:24:59,624 --> 00:25:01,811
Please leave. Just leave me alone.

407
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:03,962
I'm not here for you. I'm here for Rose.

408
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:11,803
Here.

409
00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:14,723
We were friends.

410
00:25:16,725 --> 00:25:18,703
And you're right. I am a reporter.

411
00:25:18,727 --> 00:25:20,812
But I'm not here for a
story. At least, not yet.

412
00:25:22,647 --> 00:25:24,542
I've been looking into Rose's case.

413
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:26,401
I know you didn't do it.

414
00:25:26,651 --> 00:25:28,820
And I know that two
years ago you were framed.

415
00:25:29,237 --> 00:25:30,881
How'd you find me?

416
00:25:30,905 --> 00:25:33,575
Uncle Don. He helped me.

417
00:25:33,992 --> 00:25:36,661
I don't understand.
Why would he help you?

418
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:40,582
I was in love with your daughter, Jesse.

419
00:25:43,043 --> 00:25:45,587
We were going to go
together to Chicago.

420
00:25:46,296 --> 00:25:48,274
Do you know who took my Rose?

421
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:50,759
Not entirely, but I'm close.

422
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:57,974
Deputy Brent?

423
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,836
No. No, I'm not.

424
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,612
No applause needed.

425
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:18,763
<i>I think he was</i> involved.

426
00:26:18,787 --> 00:26:20,348
I think that he planted
evidence in your house,

427
00:26:20,372 --> 00:26:22,707
but I don't think he was
the one who took Rose.

428
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:27,647
Look, his mother was ill.
They had medical bills piling up

429
00:26:27,671 --> 00:26:29,815
then I found this.

430
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:32,693
Four days after the second
search of your property,

431
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:35,363
after he found her torn
shirt in your basement,

432
00:26:35,387 --> 00:26:38,616
he just walks into wausau
general memorial hospital

433
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,643
and completes the payment
for his mother's treatment in full.

434
00:26:42,185 --> 00:26:43,937
It's nearly $10,000.

435
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,624
So, somebody paid
him to plant evidence.

436
00:26:46,648 --> 00:26:48,584
He was desperate and
they took advantage.

437
00:26:48,608 --> 00:26:50,169
So who's he working for?

438
00:26:50,193 --> 00:26:51,820
That's what I'm trying to figure out.

439
00:26:56,116 --> 00:26:57,802
<i>Wait, where are you going?</i>

440
00:26:57,826 --> 00:26:59,119
<i>To handle business.</i>

441
00:26:59,744 --> 00:27:01,555
You can't just waltz

442
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:03,307
back in there. I mean,
if anybody sees you

443
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:05,142
I appreciate you coming to see me, may,

444
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:06,894
but there isn't a second that goes by

445
00:27:06,918 --> 00:27:08,838
that I don't think about
what they took from me.

446
00:27:10,005 --> 00:27:11,816
But this needs to end.

447
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,216
There needs to be some answers.

448
00:27:36,656 --> 00:27:38,116
Where the hell did you go?

449
00:28:07,937 --> 00:28:09,999
<i>My god!</i>

450
00:28:10,023 --> 00:28:11,816
<i>Open the door! Open it!</i>

451
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:35,215
This was Rose's.

452
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:38,385
She was wearing
these the night she left.

453
00:28:39,094 --> 00:28:40,553
And this

454
00:28:41,513 --> 00:28:43,366
we found recently.

455
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,159
This is em's. Where did you get this?

456
00:28:45,183 --> 00:28:47,870
Moore creek. Same
place we found the earring.

457
00:28:47,894 --> 00:28:49,872
The sacred place.

458
00:28:49,896 --> 00:28:52,375
Well, that could just be a coincidence.

459
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,627
How do we know Moore
creek has real significance.

460
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:57,237
Because that's where I was murdered.

461
00:28:58,154 --> 00:29:02,826
Remember how mom had this
thing with the water being special?

462
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,680
She was right.

463
00:29:05,704 --> 00:29:07,956
That is where Ibrahim
took me and the water...

464
00:29:08,915 --> 00:29:11,435
That's what healed me,
but when I went fully under,

465
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:14,397
a memory came back of this person

466
00:29:14,421 --> 00:29:16,607
in an animal mask holding me down and

467
00:29:16,631 --> 00:29:20,093
he had this, this symbol

468
00:29:21,219 --> 00:29:23,072
carved on his chest.

469
00:29:23,096 --> 00:29:26,224
This symbol has been
haunting me since revival day.

470
00:29:27,017 --> 00:29:30,061
And I'm assuming Aaron didn't
have any carvings on his chest?

471
00:29:30,478 --> 00:29:32,397
No. Look,

472
00:29:33,648 --> 00:29:35,918
after I died,

473
00:29:35,942 --> 00:29:39,046
they must have just left my
body to wash down the river

474
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,923
and into bull falls.

475
00:29:40,947 --> 00:29:42,508
And when we found that,

476
00:29:42,532 --> 00:29:44,051
I followed em, which led me to Aaron.

477
00:29:44,075 --> 00:29:45,886
Who was also shot by Brent.

478
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,555
Is all of this enough of
a coincidence for you?

479
00:29:47,579 --> 00:29:50,057
When we searched
Brent's phone records,

480
00:29:50,081 --> 00:29:52,518
there was a text between him and Aaron

481
00:29:52,542 --> 00:29:54,937
sent around the time Rose went missing.

482
00:29:54,961 --> 00:29:57,380
It was a model of a car.

483
00:29:58,173 --> 00:30:00,008
A dark blue cutlass supreme.

484
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:02,987
The USB drive that we
took from Aaron's house,

485
00:30:03,011 --> 00:30:05,573
it had a text file on
it, but all it read was,

486
00:30:05,597 --> 00:30:08,117
"dark blue cutlass
supreme." I mean, could

487
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:09,994
could that be bear's car?

488
00:30:10,018 --> 00:30:11,662
Think you mean Blaine's car.

489
00:30:11,686 --> 00:30:14,290
Wait, like the crazy radio dude?

490
00:30:14,314 --> 00:30:17,668
Blaine had one of Rose's
necklaces, a bear claw.

491
00:30:17,692 --> 00:30:19,569
He said they were friends.

492
00:30:21,488 --> 00:30:23,782
Do you have any
reason to suspect Blaine?

493
00:30:24,324 --> 00:30:28,620
Our tribe's had land disputes
with the abels for decades.

494
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:32,391
His father offered a lot
of money for our land.

495
00:30:32,415 --> 00:30:35,019
That creeps how. I
knew he was not there

496
00:30:35,043 --> 00:30:37,396
just towing a car. And
he was there that night.

497
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,732
Wait, Blaine was there
the night you died?

498
00:30:39,756 --> 00:30:41,966
- Yes!
- Then it's time to go.

499
00:30:46,137 --> 00:30:48,074
Jesse... Jesse, wait.
Jesse, where are you going?

500
00:30:48,098 --> 00:30:49,617
Wait, wait, wait! Where are you going?

501
00:30:49,641 --> 00:30:51,243
I'm going to get the man

502
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:53,120
that killed my daughter and your sister.

503
00:30:53,144 --> 00:30:55,581
The last time you did this,
it didn't end well for you.

504
00:30:55,605 --> 00:30:58,501
- Let them try that again.
- Reviver or not, last I checked,

505
00:30:58,525 --> 00:31:01,128
- Blaine had a small militia.
- That's why I'm going with him.

506
00:31:01,152 --> 00:31:03,381
Em, there are mercenaries
everywhere looking for you!

507
00:31:03,405 --> 00:31:06,175
I think you know by now
I can handle myself fine.

508
00:31:06,199 --> 00:31:08,302
Getting shot and
having you heal me again

509
00:31:08,326 --> 00:31:10,471
is not part of my fricking
priorities right now, okay?

510
00:31:10,495 --> 00:31:13,206
So please stay here.
Please, please? No. Stop.

511
00:31:13,748 --> 00:31:15,768
Dana, let me go.

512
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:18,062
We don't even know if it's him.

513
00:31:18,086 --> 00:31:19,313
- What are you talking about?
- I'm not saying it's not.

514
00:31:19,337 --> 00:31:21,190
I'm just saying we need to be sure.

515
00:31:21,214 --> 00:31:23,025
Let me get jp to help.

516
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:26,153
We all trust him, right?
I can get a warrant.

517
00:31:26,177 --> 00:31:27,905
I can search the premises

518
00:31:27,929 --> 00:31:29,365
and get what we need
to make a proper arrest.

519
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:31,117
I'm ready to end this.

520
00:31:31,141 --> 00:31:33,351
We are all ready to end this.

521
00:31:34,728 --> 00:31:37,772
Your vengeance is not
going to bring our Rose peace.

522
00:31:39,649 --> 00:31:41,317
Jesse,

523
00:31:43,695 --> 00:31:45,572
I didn't come through for you last time.

524
00:31:46,364 --> 00:31:48,033
I know.

525
00:31:49,492 --> 00:31:51,536
Let me do it for you this time, okay?

526
00:31:52,328 --> 00:31:53,747
It's not going to happen again.

527
00:31:56,374 --> 00:31:58,084
Please?

528
00:32:01,755 --> 00:32:03,131
What are you writing?

529
00:32:03,631 --> 00:32:07,177
Just some poetry.

530
00:32:09,054 --> 00:32:10,513
May I?

531
00:32:11,806 --> 00:32:15,560
It's-it's not really good.

532
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:18,271
I'm sure it's very good.

533
00:32:23,443 --> 00:32:25,612
Every path finds its edge.

534
00:32:27,238 --> 00:32:29,240
<i>Silent crossing over dark</i>

535
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:33,161
<i>we mistake the silence for peace</i>

536
00:32:34,162 --> 00:32:37,624
<i>forget that longing can
echo louder than rage</i>

537
00:32:39,667 --> 00:32:43,463
<i>and the path we choose, a pit.</i>

538
00:32:44,255 --> 00:32:46,424
A stream, an icy river

539
00:32:48,259 --> 00:32:50,762
<i>is sometimes a return to what we were,</i>

540
00:32:51,763 --> 00:32:53,431
<i>to what we left behind.</i>

541
00:32:54,682 --> 00:32:57,602
We cross, dimly aware
of the depths beneath

542
00:32:58,603 --> 00:33:01,815
but these quiet Bridges
carry us beyond the dark.

543
00:33:03,775 --> 00:33:06,486
<i>Still, something yearns beneath the ice,</i>

544
00:33:07,612 --> 00:33:09,781
<i>a voice not spoken, but known.</i>

545
00:33:13,326 --> 00:33:16,413
<i>It pulls, not with force,
but with a promise.</i>

546
00:33:17,247 --> 00:33:19,165
<i>But what was lost still waits.</i>

547
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:22,419
<i>Like a memory of warmth
in a body grown cold.</i>

548
00:33:33,138 --> 00:33:34,949
<i>Unaware, we pass</i>

549
00:33:34,973 --> 00:33:38,184
over shadows waiting
below on an icy river.

550
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:42,439
It's still a work in
progress. I'm really rusty.

551
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:48,445
Rose also gave up writing.
Couple of years before.

552
00:33:50,697 --> 00:33:52,365
I'm really sorry

553
00:33:52,949 --> 00:33:54,617
about Rose.

554
00:34:29,903 --> 00:34:31,571
Blue cutlass.

555
00:35:11,736 --> 00:35:13,446
You really loved her?

556
00:35:16,992 --> 00:35:18,618
I really did.

557
00:35:20,829 --> 00:35:22,706
You ever had anyone like that?

558
00:35:25,667 --> 00:35:27,293
Yeah.

559
00:35:28,795 --> 00:35:30,714
Yeah, maybe.

560
00:35:49,607 --> 00:35:51,335
Rhodey?

561
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,004
Em?

562
00:35:53,028 --> 00:35:54,755
Holy shit. Are you-are you okay?

563
00:35:54,779 --> 00:35:57,574
Rhodey... my god.

564
00:35:58,742 --> 00:36:01,453
My god.

565
00:36:01,995 --> 00:36:03,455
I've been so worried.

566
00:36:03,955 --> 00:36:05,999
<i>I've called so many times.</i>

567
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:09,711
- Are you safe?
- I am now. I managed to escape.

568
00:36:10,462 --> 00:36:14,734
It's crazy. Listen, em,
we can't talk for long.

569
00:36:14,758 --> 00:36:16,485
You called just in time.
I'm getting out of here.

570
00:36:16,509 --> 00:36:18,195
Come with me. <i>- What?</i>

571
00:36:18,219 --> 00:36:20,531
Rhodey, no, I don't-i don't think I can.

572
00:36:20,555 --> 00:36:23,784
I'm with my sister and we
are so close to figuring this out.

573
00:36:23,808 --> 00:36:25,619
Like, I know who killed me.

574
00:36:25,643 --> 00:36:27,747
<i>Em, listen to me, you can't stay.</i>

575
00:36:27,771 --> 00:36:30,273
They've got some drug that
really messes with revivers.

576
00:36:30,648 --> 00:36:31,775
You gotta get out.

577
00:36:32,567 --> 00:36:33,943
<i>Come with me.</i>

578
00:36:36,571 --> 00:36:38,031
<i>What's going on?</i>

579
00:36:40,825 --> 00:36:42,452
What is it?

580
00:36:43,661 --> 00:36:45,872
It's okay. Look,

581
00:36:47,332 --> 00:36:49,042
can we at least say goodbye?

582
00:36:54,339 --> 00:36:58,027
Okay. Okay, yeah.

583
00:36:58,051 --> 00:37:01,304
<i>Yeah, just meet me past
the camp at unity drive.</i>

584
00:37:02,013 --> 00:37:03,807
<i>Okay.</i>

585
00:37:13,024 --> 00:37:14,710
Mr. Abel.

586
00:37:14,734 --> 00:37:16,545
- What?
- It's the angel, sir.

587
00:37:16,569 --> 00:37:18,089
- What?
- It's gone!

588
00:37:18,113 --> 00:37:19,924
What?

589
00:37:19,948 --> 00:37:21,574
Tyler!

590
00:37:23,618 --> 00:37:26,454
What? What did you say?

591
00:37:33,044 --> 00:37:34,754
Em?

592
00:37:40,051 --> 00:37:41,678
Em!

593
00:37:43,722 --> 00:37:45,032
Have you seen my sister?

594
00:37:45,056 --> 00:37:48,143
I'm sorry. I didn't see her go.

595
00:37:48,893 --> 00:37:50,538
I guess she snuck out.

596
00:37:50,562 --> 00:37:52,105
Shit. Shit.

597
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,869
Is...?

598
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,039
No!

599
00:38:14,294 --> 00:38:15,920
You were right, uncle.

600
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:20,258
I knew you'd bring her back.

601
00:38:33,146 --> 00:38:35,541
<i>No! Let me go!</i>

602
00:38:35,565 --> 00:38:38,068
<i>Please. No!</i>

603
00:38:44,366 --> 00:38:45,950
I've got her.

604
00:39:06,638 --> 00:39:08,890
I've got her. I'll meet you at Moore creek.

605
00:39:37,085 --> 00:39:38,753
What was that?

606
00:39:39,963 --> 00:39:41,631
It's calling me.

607
00:39:45,343 --> 00:39:47,012
And I'm ready to go.

608
00:39:57,105 --> 00:39:58,773
I'm ready now.

609
00:40:00,025 --> 00:40:01,693
Our Rose can move on.

610
00:40:04,279 --> 00:40:06,114
It's time for us to go, too.

611
00:40:26,259 --> 00:40:27,969
Rhodey?

612
00:40:32,974 --> 00:40:34,392
Em.

613
00:40:54,829 --> 00:40:55,931
Hey.

614
00:40:55,955 --> 00:40:57,308
Hey, hey, hey.

615
00:40:57,332 --> 00:40:59,042
Don't cry. It's okay.

616
00:40:59,876 --> 00:41:02,146
Look, I really gotta finish this,

617
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:04,148
but then I can come meet you wherever.

618
00:41:04,172 --> 00:41:06,067
Like, Austin, or Nashville.

619
00:41:06,091 --> 00:41:07,842
Or no, no, no! You,

620
00:41:08,301 --> 00:41:10,095
you said we're going to the ocean, right?

621
00:41:16,101 --> 00:41:17,727
What's wrong?

622
00:41:20,271 --> 00:41:21,856
I'm so sorry, em.

623
00:41:29,072 --> 00:41:30,466
I'm sorry.

624
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:32,176
I'm so sorry.

625
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,035
- What is this?
- So sorry.

626
00:41:43,962 --> 00:41:45,296
<i>Copy.</i>

627
00:41:48,091 --> 00:41:49,610
<i>Target is acquired.</i>

628
00:41:49,634 --> 00:41:51,386
<i>Moving her to a secure location.</i>

629
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:54,472
<i>Team 3, team 4, proceed with caution.</i>

630
00:41:56,975 --> 00:41:58,536
<i>Northwest Ridge. Target is acquired.</i>

631
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,520
<i>Target is acquired.</i>
