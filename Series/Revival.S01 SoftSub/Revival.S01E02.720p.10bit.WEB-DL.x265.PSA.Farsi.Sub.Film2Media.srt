<i>- Officer Cypress unresponsive.</i>
- Put this on. Quick.

105
00:06:24,018 --> 00:06:25,253

-You say that you--

106
00:06:25,353 --> 00:06:26,721
<i>I've got eyes</i>
<i>on her location.</i>

107
00:06:26,821 --> 00:06:29,389
-You were outside
and you heard gunshots.

108
00:06:29,824 --> 00:06:31,993
And you ran inside
but everything was already done.

109
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:35,196
You didn't touch her -- I did.
Okay?

110
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:37,565
She went crazy. She killed her--

111
00:06:37,665 --> 00:06:38,833
-Mountain Bay County Police!

112
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,167
- She tried to kill me,
but I cut her.

113
00:06:40,301 --> 00:06:42,136
-Just me and you can know.
Promise?

114
00:06:42,203 --> 00:06:44,205
- Yes, yes, yes!
- Dana! You okay?

115
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:46,340
-Yeah, it's good.
We're good! It's okay!

116
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:47,742
It's all right. It's all right.

117
00:06:47,842 --> 00:06:50,678
-Holy smokes. Are you okay?
Wha...

118
00:06:50,745 --> 00:06:52,179
-Her.

119
00:06:52,914 --> 00:06:54,348
-The old lady?

120
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:56,517
Yeah.

121
00:06:57,518 --> 00:06:58,920
She's stronger than she looks.

122
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,857
But we're okay.

123
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:07,028
We're okay.

124
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:15,403
-Hello?

125
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:26,781
Whoa!

126
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:37,391
Looking for these?

127
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:42,563
-Oh. Thanks.

128
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:44,432
-You're welcome.

129
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:49,036
What's your name, son?

130
00:07:49,103 --> 00:07:52,306
-I'm not supposed
to talk to strangers.

131
00:07:54,442 --> 00:07:55,910
-Fair enough.

132
00:07:57,945 --> 00:07:59,213
And I'm guessing

133
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:02,616
you're also not supposed to be
in the woods alone.

134
00:08:03,084 --> 00:08:05,319
-Sorry. I got lost.

135
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:08,456
-Oh, don't be.

136
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:12,159
Why don't you run along this way
and be found?

137
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,003
Cooper!

138
00:08:23,771 --> 00:08:25,840
-Papa!
-Dude!

139
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:29,010
Oh my God! Are you nuts?!

140
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,644
I told you to stay put!

141
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:33,447
Your mother didn't teach you
not to run off like that?

142
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:35,149
-Did you hear it?

143
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:36,484
-Hear what?

144
00:08:36,951 --> 00:08:38,285
There's something out there.

145
00:08:50,865 --> 00:08:52,533
Ma'am? Ma'am?

146
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:56,437
She's having a panic attack.
Get her out of here.

147
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:58,139
-How am I supposed to explain

148
00:08:58,272 --> 00:09:00,474
how an 80-year-old woman
ended up with a scalped head?

149
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,977
-She was a hell of a lot more
than just some old woman.

150
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:05,312
God, what a mess.

151
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,548
We got to keep the press
out of this as much as we can.

152
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:09,016
-Okay.
I don't even want to know

153
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,551
what my dad's gonna do.

154
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:12,987
This all needs to die with her.

155
00:09:14,989 --> 00:09:16,991
You talk to Dittman,
assuming he wakes up,

156
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:18,527
and I'll get Em on board.

157
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,195
-Yeah.
-Where is Em?

158
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:23,964
-Isn't that Em?

159
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:26,333
-Oh, shit!

160
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:39,980
Oh! Ooh. Um.

161
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:47,088
-Huh.
-Mm.

162
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,026
-We've tested and verified
every known reviver

163
00:09:52,093 --> 00:09:53,427
and, to date,
not a single one has shown

164
00:09:53,528 --> 00:09:56,931
any aggressive tendencies
or abnormalities,

165
00:09:57,031 --> 00:10:00,701
so what is different about you?

166
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:03,538
Let's do the autopsy here.

167
00:10:05,206 --> 00:10:07,441
Nobody gets
inside this room, okay?

168
00:10:08,042 --> 00:10:09,910
And, uh, I'm going to need
another set of hands.

169
00:10:10,044 --> 00:10:11,712
-Okay.
-Got to put together a kit.

170
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:13,180
Okay.

171
00:10:13,247 --> 00:10:14,516
-Okay.

172
00:10:38,439 --> 00:10:42,076
-Seems you're fit as a fiddle.
Just a little panic attack.

173
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:43,612
You're free to go.

174
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:45,246
-Thanks.

175
00:10:46,981 --> 00:10:48,415
Dude!

176
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:50,050
-Ooh. I know.

177
00:10:50,585 --> 00:10:54,121
Relax, okay? They don't know.
I just, I passed out, but I--

178
00:10:54,255 --> 00:10:56,157
-You're not okay.
You're not fine!

179
00:10:56,257 --> 00:10:57,658
What happened to you?

180
00:10:57,758 --> 00:11:00,595
-Okay, I'm still working on it.

181
00:11:01,095 --> 00:11:03,297
But the truth is,
is it's all fuzzy.

182
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,600
I wasn't in the best place
and I just, I can't remember.

183
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:06,800
-Why didn't you come to me?

184
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:09,436
I mean, you can't just die
and not tell me.

185
00:11:09,571 --> 00:11:12,273
-I will tell you
everything I can remember.

186
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:14,441
Can we just get out of here?
-Emmy!

187
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:17,077
-Martha! Tell me you're okay.

188
00:11:17,144 --> 00:11:18,613
-She's good. She's fine.

189
00:11:19,113 --> 00:11:20,281
-Let me look at you.
Are you sure?

190
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:21,516
They said you came by ambulance!

191
00:11:21,616 --> 00:11:23,652
-I'm fine.
Just a panic attack, seriously.

192
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:25,252
-She's seriously fine.
Didn't we talk about--

193
00:11:25,319 --> 00:11:27,855
-What were you thinking?
Taking your sister

194
00:11:27,955 --> 00:11:29,290
to a crime scene?
-Okay.

195
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,292
-I raised you
with more sense than that.

196
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:34,128
-Uh, let me explain
what happened.

197
00:11:34,195 --> 00:11:36,030
How was your day?

198
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,798
-Well, I got lost in the woods.

199
00:11:37,932 --> 00:11:39,433
...for a reason, Dana.

200
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,936
-Is that so?
-I'm just so tired.

201
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:43,337
-It's okay.
They'll stop soon.

202
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,872
I don't think
I'm above protocol.

203
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:46,340
- I know.
- Also, I was rethink--

204
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:48,142
-Bottom line is I don't care!

205
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:50,811
If you had any inkling
this situation was dangerous.

206
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:52,146
She's not like us!
You know that!

207
00:11:52,213 --> 00:11:54,315
-Sir, ma'am, if you could--
-Not now!

208
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:57,785
-Please! Really! You know?
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. Em.

209
00:11:57,851 --> 00:11:59,554
-Let go!
-What are you doing?

210
00:11:59,688 --> 00:12:02,389
You can't grab her like that!
How can you be so careless?

211
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:05,326
-Careless, Dad? Are you
not the one who lost Coop today?

212
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,962
-What?
What happened with Cooper?

213
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:09,230
-Nothing. Cooper's fine.

214
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,666
And I'm fine! Okay?

215
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:17,338
I don't need your help,
your protection, your advice,

216
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:19,907
your pity -- none of it.
I'm done.

217
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:21,008
-Martha, honey.
-No!

218
00:12:21,075 --> 00:12:23,377
No, please,
I want to be left alone.

219
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:25,246
-But you...
-No!

220
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:27,649
I will figure it out
on my own.

221
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:33,354
-Okay, well, thanks a lot, Dad.
That was your fault.

222
00:12:33,487 --> 00:12:35,356
-My fault?
Is that what happened to you?

223
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,191
-Yeah, but we're not
unpacking all that right now.

224
00:12:37,258 --> 00:12:39,193
Now tell me what happened--
-I don't even--

225
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,529
-Sheriff, we need to talk.
-Rogers.

226
00:12:42,697 --> 00:12:46,233
Listen, I need you to monitor
who's coming and going.

227
00:12:46,367 --> 00:12:49,003
I want to keep a tight lid
on this whole mess, all right?

228
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:51,105
Nobody talks to the press.
-Yes, sir.

229
00:12:51,205 --> 00:12:52,873
-All right?

230
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,009
Get Cooper home. Okay?

231
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:57,044
We'll talk about this later.

232
00:12:57,177 --> 00:12:58,747
-Yeah.
-Yes?

233
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,381
-Uh, yeah, this way.

234
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,383
-Okay, what happened today
with Papa?

235
00:13:02,517 --> 00:13:04,686
-I met a man in the woods.

236
00:13:04,753 --> 00:13:06,755
- You what?

237
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:09,056
I'm gonna to shove his protocol
right up his ass!

238
00:13:09,123 --> 00:13:11,458
-Mom, language.
-Ma'am, you need to leave.

239
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:13,360
You can't be here.
-Can I just have one minute?

240
00:13:13,427 --> 00:13:16,263
-Okay, look, you know what?
I'll take care of her.

241
00:13:16,397 --> 00:13:17,965
I know her, so, um,

242
00:13:18,065 --> 00:13:20,200
can you take Coop
up to the cafeteria

243
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:23,070
and get him, like,
some pudding cups, or something?

244
00:13:23,137 --> 00:13:24,305
-Sure thing.
-Okay, thanks.

245
00:13:24,405 --> 00:13:25,774
I'll see you up there, bud.

246
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:32,747
-You want to tell me what
actually happened in that barn?

247
00:13:34,582 --> 00:13:35,916
<i>That's the thing.</i>

248
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,752
<i>Strength has as much</i>
to do with the nervous system

249
00:13:37,885 --> 00:13:41,255
as muscle mass and without
the proper pain response the--

250
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:43,123
Where's the guard?

251
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:45,392
-Um...

252
00:13:47,428 --> 00:13:48,929
Uh...

253
00:13:54,736 --> 00:13:56,270
-Jesus Christ.

254
00:13:58,305 --> 00:14:00,240
I need everyone
to the first floor!

255
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:02,610
Everyone to the first floor.
Suspect is on the loose.

256
00:14:02,677 --> 00:14:05,245
It's Arlene. She's alive.

257
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:06,648
<i>The real joke is</i>

258
00:14:06,781 --> 00:14:09,316
your department thinking that
it can just sweep all this

259
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,619
under the rug. Again.
Tell me the truth.

260
00:14:11,753 --> 00:14:13,655
-All right.
Well, I'll tell you what:

261
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:15,590
you keep thinking

262
00:14:15,657 --> 00:14:17,826
that you are living
in an episode of The Wire

263
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,094
and the rest of us will just...

264
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,663
- ...keep up.
<i>- Code red.</i>

265
00:14:21,796 --> 00:14:23,497
<i>Emergency department.</i>
<i>First floor.</i>

266
00:14:23,631 --> 00:14:27,301
<i>ode red. Emergency department.C</i>
<i>First floor.</i>

267
00:14:31,806 --> 00:14:33,474
- Literally.
- Running with scissors.

268
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:34,809
Hey! Stay!

269
00:14:36,477 --> 00:14:37,645
Jesus Christ.

270
00:14:45,653 --> 00:14:47,287
Oh my God.

271
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:51,826
- What's going on?
- Ahhh!

272
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:53,293
-Oh, shit.

273
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,697
-What the hell is happening?
-I've got to get Cooper.

274
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,398
- Go!
- Dana!

275
00:14:57,498 --> 00:14:58,666
-Dad.
-What are you doing here?

276
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,300
Where's Cooper?
-He'll be safe.

277
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:01,870
But, Dad, be careful.
-Just get out of here!

278
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:03,303
-Dad, you can't stop her!

279
00:15:05,673 --> 00:15:07,709
Go! Get out of here.
-I'm going.

280
00:15:11,345 --> 00:15:12,747
Troy, check him.

281
00:15:21,188 --> 00:15:22,690
My Terry.

282
00:15:23,257 --> 00:15:26,528
My sweet baby.
-Shh.

283
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:35,202
Shh. There, there.

284
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:46,881
-Come on!
Arlene, put the baby down!

285
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:48,850
Oh, shit.

286
00:15:55,189 --> 00:15:57,291
Where did she go?

287
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,898
There!

288
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:09,470
Where the hell is she?

289
00:16:11,472 --> 00:16:14,074
Let's spread out.
Stay quiet.

290
00:16:30,424 --> 00:16:32,794
Put your hands up
and turn around.

291
00:16:34,228 --> 00:16:37,665
Put your hands in the air!

292
00:16:45,773 --> 00:16:47,609
What the hell
are you doing here, Blaine?

293
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:50,110
Oh.

294
00:16:54,983 --> 00:16:56,450
-Where did you get the baby?

295
00:16:56,851 --> 00:16:57,986
Where's Arlene?

296
00:16:58,118 --> 00:16:59,353
-Behold.

297
00:16:59,888 --> 00:17:03,758
And I have given you permission
to tread on the serpents

298
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,860
and the scorpions.

299
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,331
The gates of Hell have opened.

300
00:17:15,603 --> 00:17:16,971
<i>You're worried</i>
<i>about panic?</i>

301
00:17:17,104 --> 00:17:18,673
<i>hat about when people find outW</i>

302
00:17:18,806 --> 00:17:19,807
<i>that there's some super-strong</i>

303
00:17:19,941 --> 00:17:22,309
reviver running around
stealing babies

304
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:24,177
and throwing nurses
through walls?

305
00:17:24,311 --> 00:17:25,513
-Oh, Wayne.

306
00:17:25,647 --> 00:17:27,515
-I can't police something
that can't be killed!

307
00:17:27,649 --> 00:17:28,816
-Not doing it.
-Look, look. First off

308
00:17:28,883 --> 00:17:30,818
we don't really have
a proud history of

309
00:17:30,952 --> 00:17:32,854
handling people
that are different.

310
00:17:32,987 --> 00:17:36,390
But, that being said, Mayor,
you didn't see her.

311
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,392
This was different,
so, you know,

312
00:17:38,492 --> 00:17:40,662
perhaps until we know
what we're fully dealing with

313
00:17:40,728 --> 00:17:42,630
all options
should remain viable.

314
00:17:42,697 --> 00:17:44,532
-See?
Even the bleeding-heart liberal

315
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,901
agrees with me.
We need to lock them up!

316
00:17:47,001 --> 00:17:48,703
-Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't say that. I--

317
00:17:48,836 --> 00:17:51,138
-Okay, I want to help. I do.

318
00:17:51,739 --> 00:17:53,708
You've been complaining about
a lack of resources

319
00:17:53,841 --> 00:17:55,342
this whole time.
What do you think

320
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:56,911
it's gonna take
to set up your camp?

321
00:17:57,011 --> 00:18:00,180
And if Arlene's as scary
as y'all say she is,

322
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:02,917
I suggest that you take
what little resources you have

323
00:18:03,017 --> 00:18:05,853
and you find her.
You do that and then we'll talk.

324
00:18:12,694 --> 00:18:14,161
<i>Em?</i>

325
00:18:17,665 --> 00:18:20,100
You here? We need to talk.

326
00:18:31,345 --> 00:18:32,747
Shit.

327
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:16,256
-What do you think
you're doing?

328
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,763
-What the hell is this?

329
00:19:21,829 --> 00:19:22,930
-This is your idea
of leaving me alone?

330
00:19:22,997 --> 00:19:25,165
-Hey!
Cut me some slack here, man!

331
00:19:25,767 --> 00:19:27,935
One minute we're talking about
us going to the beach

332
00:19:28,002 --> 00:19:30,170
and then the next
I watch you die!

333
00:19:30,805 --> 00:19:33,608
But then you're alive
because you had already died.

334
00:19:33,741 --> 00:19:35,308
And you don't know
how you died

335
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:36,944
and now I find out
you're using again

336
00:19:37,078 --> 00:19:38,613
and when Dad finds out
you're dead.

337
00:19:38,746 --> 00:19:41,115
-Is there a question there?
-Seven thousand questions.

338
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:42,617
But let's start with this:

339
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:45,119
What the hell!
I thought you were doing better.

340
00:19:45,252 --> 00:19:47,487
-Yeah, I... I was.

341
00:19:48,923 --> 00:19:50,692
And then our accident happened

342
00:19:50,792 --> 00:19:54,428
and that new
instant release shit is hardcore

343
00:19:54,494 --> 00:19:56,831
so it, just, it got bad.

344
00:19:57,431 --> 00:19:59,033
-Are you still on them?
-No.

345
00:20:00,467 --> 00:20:02,637
When I woke up
it stopped working. I...

346
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:04,972
I sometimes still think
that I need it,

347
00:20:05,106 --> 00:20:08,375
but it doesn't have
the same effect on me anymore

348
00:20:08,475 --> 00:20:11,145
so I'm clean.

349
00:20:12,647 --> 00:20:13,881
-There's like
a thousand pills in here.

350
00:20:13,981 --> 00:20:15,482
How did you even get all this?

351
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:18,285
-The shady pain clinic.
If you have the money,

352
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:20,988
they don't really care.
-How did you get the money?

353
00:20:23,991 --> 00:20:25,993
Em, isn't this
all kind of connected?

354
00:20:26,661 --> 00:20:28,129
The drugs, the...

355
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:32,299
What happened to you could--
-No, I did not overdose.

356
00:20:32,867 --> 00:20:34,502
-Didn't you?
Like, I saw, like...

357
00:20:34,635 --> 00:20:35,970
Like, I just saw
your den of doom

358
00:20:36,037 --> 00:20:38,906
and it's kind of,
I'm vibing, like,

359
00:20:39,006 --> 00:20:41,475
mental health crisis.
-Because ever since I revived

360
00:20:41,542 --> 00:20:43,811
I just can't,
I can't sleep anymore.

361
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:49,684
-Oh, God, you're emo.

362
00:20:51,686 --> 00:20:54,188
Okay, how about you tell me...

363
00:20:55,355 --> 00:20:57,558
Something? Anything.

364
00:21:04,565 --> 00:21:06,734
So, I, uh...

365
00:21:08,503 --> 00:21:10,370
I went to the bridge
on Mom's birthday

366
00:21:10,505 --> 00:21:12,540
because I just, I...

367
00:21:12,673 --> 00:21:14,108
I'm working through some stuff
and a friend said

368
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,244
it would be a really good idea
to get some closure there

369
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:17,712
and it just, it got...

370
00:21:17,845 --> 00:21:19,213
a lot and I got really anxious,

371
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,616
so, yes, I got high and then
I woke up in Bull Falls.

372
00:21:24,685 --> 00:21:26,087
-Okay.

373
00:21:27,354 --> 00:21:29,190
You skipped a bunch of details.

374
00:21:29,624 --> 00:21:31,058
Help me out here.

375
00:21:32,727 --> 00:21:33,928
-Like, now?

376
00:21:34,061 --> 00:21:36,197
-Yeah, now.
You have somewhere else to be?

377
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,869
-Um...

378
00:21:43,137 --> 00:21:45,472
Yeah, it was, uh, nine, or...

379
00:21:45,573 --> 00:21:48,042
Nine-thirty.

380
00:21:50,545 --> 00:21:51,946
I think I saw, like,

381
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:55,382
a car headlight, or something.

382
00:21:57,084 --> 00:21:58,886
-Could it have been
a hit and run?

383
00:21:58,953 --> 00:22:00,288
What kind of car was it?

384
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,757
-I don't know. A normal car?

385
00:22:04,926 --> 00:22:07,795
-Okay, well,
did you smell anything

386
00:22:07,929 --> 00:22:08,796
<i>...or...</i>

387
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,765
...hear anything, <i>or--</i>

388
00:22:10,832 --> 00:22:13,100
<i>- Dana, please.</i> Just stop.
- Or did you...

389
00:22:14,101 --> 00:22:15,670
maybe...

390
00:22:18,471 --> 00:22:19,941
did you hurt yourself?

391
00:22:23,443 --> 00:22:24,846
-You know, I've, uh,

392
00:22:26,113 --> 00:22:28,850
thought about that
a lot recently and, um...

393
00:22:30,985 --> 00:22:33,120
No, no. I wouldn't. I, uh...

394
00:22:33,654 --> 00:22:35,256
I couldn't.

395
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:43,931
- Shit!
I'm missing morning briefing.

396
00:22:43,998 --> 00:22:45,833
Dad's gonna kill me.
-Mm-hm.

397
00:22:45,967 --> 00:22:47,635
-Well, I guess that's
insensitive now.

398
00:22:47,702 --> 00:22:49,036
I can't say anything.
-Oh, Dana.

399
00:22:49,136 --> 00:22:51,005
Sometimes you are just too much.

400
00:22:51,138 --> 00:22:53,307
Just wait, wait! Come to--

401
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,942
Goddamn it!

402
00:22:55,009 --> 00:22:57,044
Just come to
the station with me, okay?

403
00:22:57,144 --> 00:23:00,014
Just come real quick.
I'll show my stupid face

404
00:23:00,147 --> 00:23:02,950
and look like I'm doing my job
and then you and me,

405
00:23:03,017 --> 00:23:05,553
we'll go to the bridge,
we'll go to where you woke up.

406
00:23:05,653 --> 00:23:07,288
-Dana.

407
00:23:07,355 --> 00:23:10,291
-Okay. Please. I, I...

408
00:23:10,858 --> 00:23:12,860
I want to find out
what happened to you.

409
00:23:14,295 --> 00:23:15,796
And I can.

410
00:23:18,165 --> 00:23:19,367
-Okay.

411
00:23:20,635 --> 00:23:22,303
Yeah, let's go get this
over with.

412
00:23:26,974 --> 00:23:29,010
Okay.

413
00:23:29,143 --> 00:23:31,012
Where should we put
this mountain of drugs?

414
00:23:43,858 --> 00:23:45,593
All right, listen up!

415
00:23:47,862 --> 00:23:50,364
- Great.
Love when he's in a good mood.

416
00:23:50,497 --> 00:23:53,000
- You said this would be quick.
- So be careful!

417
00:23:53,067 --> 00:23:54,769
-I know, I just,
I'm supposed to be helping

418
00:23:54,869 --> 00:23:56,904
with this Arlene insanity.

419
00:23:57,271 --> 00:23:59,707
But I want to be here
for you first.

420
00:24:01,742 --> 00:24:03,210
Give me a second.

421
00:24:04,745 --> 00:24:06,213
Okay.

422
00:24:06,714 --> 00:24:09,449
Okay. Sit. Um...

423
00:24:11,886 --> 00:24:13,486
Grab something
from the vending machine?

424
00:24:13,587 --> 00:24:16,090
Uh, maybe hang out
in the break room for a bit?

425
00:24:16,624 --> 00:24:18,059
I'll be quick.

426
00:24:18,726 --> 00:24:19,894
Get me a chocolate bar.

427
00:24:56,764 --> 00:24:58,099
-What the hell do you want?

428
00:24:59,667 --> 00:25:01,435
Can you tell me about these?

429
00:25:05,172 --> 00:25:06,907
-Where are you
picking your blueberries from?

430
00:25:06,974 --> 00:25:09,744
-I don't have time
for your stupid adages, McCray.

431
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:11,479
Come on.

432
00:25:14,181 --> 00:25:17,118
-Blues. Oxycodone. IRs.

433
00:25:17,184 --> 00:25:21,055
-I know what they are. How much
would a thousand of these cost?

434
00:25:21,155 --> 00:25:23,024
-Now, see the street value
of it would be--

435
00:25:23,124 --> 00:25:25,026
-No, no. Pain clinic.

436
00:25:25,126 --> 00:25:26,460
-You ain't getting
no G of those

437
00:25:26,594 --> 00:25:28,963
from no pain clinic.
-Well, where am I getting them?

438
00:25:29,096 --> 00:25:31,298
-Ooh. Stealing or dealing.

439
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:33,801
-For who? From who?

440
00:25:34,368 --> 00:25:37,338
-Well, who are you?
I'm not doing your job for you.

441
00:25:41,475 --> 00:25:44,478
Now, may I please get back
to finding the old lady?

442
00:25:45,546 --> 00:25:48,716
-How many drug-related offenses
do we have?

443
00:25:51,719 --> 00:25:53,387
-Yeah, you shake up the can

444
00:25:54,989 --> 00:25:56,857
be prepared
to deal with the fizz.

445
00:26:21,582 --> 00:26:23,050
Shit.

446
00:26:23,584 --> 00:26:26,220
My sister stole my car.

447
00:26:26,921 --> 00:26:28,489
Is there anything I can snag?

448
00:26:28,557 --> 00:26:31,692
-Uh-oh. Sorry, darling,
everything's gone.

449
00:26:31,826 --> 00:26:33,694
On account of the manhunt
for Arlene.

450
00:26:33,828 --> 00:26:35,196
-Could I borrow yours?

451
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:37,264
-Uh, no. Lester dropped me off.

452
00:26:37,364 --> 00:26:39,200
-Oh, you could do
so much better than him.

453
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:42,571
-Well, Lester's a man
of hidden talents.

454
00:26:44,004 --> 00:26:47,408
-What about McCray?
Or your dad, hm?

455
00:26:49,043 --> 00:26:51,011
-Whose is the little hybrid
out front?

456
00:26:51,078 --> 00:26:53,180
-That's Dr. Ramin's.

457
00:27:10,231 --> 00:27:11,699
-You look beautiful.

458
00:27:16,937 --> 00:27:18,405
-Are you sure
you're up for this?

459
00:27:19,574 --> 00:27:20,975
we don't have to go.

460
00:27:21,576 --> 00:27:22,810
-No.

461
00:27:23,545 --> 00:27:25,580
It's important
we keep up appearances.

462
00:27:56,677 --> 00:27:58,179
Let's try the dorms next.

463
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:00,014
Polos East off campus,
down this way.

464
00:28:04,451 --> 00:28:06,353
<i>Safety continues to</i>
<i>be a concern</i>

465
00:28:06,453 --> 00:28:09,089
<i>as the suspect</i>
<i>is still on the loose.</i>

466
00:28:09,156 --> 00:28:11,358
<i>Authorities have yet</i>
<i>to determine a motive</i>

467
00:28:11,458 --> 00:28:14,028
<i>for the 82-year-old woman's</i>
<i>violent outburst.</i>

468
00:28:14,128 --> 00:28:15,664
Nobody's doing
anything!

469
00:28:15,796 --> 00:28:18,165
I don't care if
they used to be good people.

470
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,034
-Em.

471
00:28:21,503 --> 00:28:22,970
You okay, dear?

472
00:28:23,337 --> 00:28:24,805
-Yeah, I'm fine, Nella.

473
00:28:30,512 --> 00:28:32,713
<i>Shouldn't we, uh,</i>
be searching for Arlene

474
00:28:32,813 --> 00:28:34,181
instead of, uh, your car?

475
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:37,519
-Shouldn't you be looking
in a microscope

476
00:28:37,652 --> 00:28:39,954
at a... imbiba nucleus?

477
00:28:42,223 --> 00:28:44,892
I don't even think you know
what you're saying.

478
00:28:44,992 --> 00:28:46,994
-It's a tiny record store.
-Oh.

479
00:28:47,696 --> 00:28:49,129
-And, anyway,
we're not looking for a car.

480
00:28:49,196 --> 00:28:51,566
We're looking for my sister
in the car.

481
00:28:51,666 --> 00:28:53,234
-Okay, and why, exactly,

482
00:28:53,334 --> 00:28:55,135
would your sister
commandeer your car?

483
00:28:55,202 --> 00:28:58,839
-She's acting out, that's all.
All right? She's young.

484
00:28:59,541 --> 00:29:02,577
She's had a sheltered life,
sheltered childhood.

485
00:29:02,677 --> 00:29:06,247
She never got to mess around,
be a real teenager, you know?

486
00:29:06,347 --> 00:29:08,315
Make mistakes.
-Hm.

487
00:29:08,382 --> 00:29:10,719
-Hell, I don't think
she's ever even had a boyfriend.

488
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,401
-Aaron.

489
00:29:28,369 --> 00:29:30,037
-Em, what in God's name
are you doing?

490
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:32,006
My wife is right there!
-What am I doing?

491
00:29:32,072 --> 00:29:33,374
You haven't answered
any of my texts,

492
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,676
calls or emails
for the last month.

493
00:29:34,743 --> 00:29:37,177
I practically had to corner you
in your office

494
00:29:37,244 --> 00:29:39,380
to get you to agree to meet me
and you ghost me!

495
00:29:39,446 --> 00:29:41,115
-Well, Em, what do you
expect me to do?

496
00:29:41,215 --> 00:29:42,950
We agreed to end this.
You know that!

497
00:29:43,718 --> 00:29:45,587
You think this is how
to get back together with me?

498
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,556
-Jesus Christ, Aaron.
You are so full of yourself.

499
00:29:48,623 --> 00:29:51,125
I don't wanna get back together.
Stop dodging me!

500
00:29:51,225 --> 00:29:54,094
I want answers
of what happened near the falls!

501
00:29:54,862 --> 00:29:56,564
-The falls? What? I...

502
00:29:57,231 --> 00:29:58,899
I don't know what you--

503
00:30:01,268 --> 00:30:03,705
A ring?
-Your ring!

504
00:30:03,772 --> 00:30:06,407
Look, something happened to me
that night at Bull Falls.

505
00:30:06,541 --> 00:30:09,209
I woke up and I threw this up,
so now you get to explain to me

506
00:30:09,276 --> 00:30:10,878
how the hell your wedding ring
came out of my mouth?

507
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:13,113
-Wait. First, that's not mine.

508
00:30:13,782 --> 00:30:15,883
Second, I have no idea
what any of this is about.

509
00:30:15,949 --> 00:30:17,318
If you've been trying
to reach me

510
00:30:17,418 --> 00:30:18,952
I haven't gotten
anything from you

511
00:30:19,086 --> 00:30:20,755
since December 18th.

512
00:30:21,623 --> 00:30:23,290
I had to block you.
You kept texting

513
00:30:23,424 --> 00:30:24,726
and calling that night
and it felt like you were

514
00:30:24,793 --> 00:30:27,294
hell-bent on exposing us
and I couldn't risk it.

515
00:30:27,762 --> 00:30:30,497
So I blocked your number
and email. I had no choice!

516
00:30:30,598 --> 00:30:32,099
-What? Shit.

517
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:33,934
-And I'm sorry.

518
00:30:34,068 --> 00:30:35,436
Perhaps instead of you

519
00:30:35,503 --> 00:30:37,938
throwing up a ring maybe
you thought you saw something

520
00:30:38,072 --> 00:30:39,406
and found a ring
that had been left there.

521
00:30:39,473 --> 00:30:41,609
People go to those falls often,
Em.

522
00:30:43,611 --> 00:30:44,813
- Shit.

523
00:30:46,614 --> 00:30:48,583
- I don't know.
I don't-

524
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:50,652
I don't remember sending any
of those texts or calls.

525
00:30:50,785 --> 00:30:53,621
I was really emotional
and I got high and I thought

526
00:30:53,688 --> 00:30:55,657
you'd be the one to tell me
what happened that night.

527
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:57,958
I thought you'd tell me
what happened to me.

528
00:30:58,092 --> 00:30:59,493
To you?

529
00:31:01,929 --> 00:31:03,531
Wait, Em, did you...

530
00:31:05,466 --> 00:31:06,801
-Mm.

531
00:31:06,934 --> 00:31:08,335
- You died.

532
00:31:10,638 --> 00:31:11,939
You're a reviver.

533
00:31:12,373 --> 00:31:15,510
Holy shit!

534
00:31:16,276 --> 00:31:17,645
I had no idea.

535
00:31:19,146 --> 00:31:20,548
And then...

536
00:31:21,816 --> 00:31:23,852
-Oh, no, that night
those texts were scary

537
00:31:23,984 --> 00:31:26,153
and I knew you were struggling,
but I, I...

538
00:31:26,286 --> 00:31:28,155
I had no idea
you took this so hard.

539
00:31:28,222 --> 00:31:29,657
-I've heard this before.

540
00:31:31,191 --> 00:31:32,727
You think I killed myself?

541
00:31:33,994 --> 00:31:36,831
-I'm sorry, but isn't that
kind of what you're saying?

542
00:31:41,235 --> 00:31:43,838
But, hey, look, look.
You're okay now.

543
00:31:43,971 --> 00:31:45,339
-That's the good news, right?

544
00:31:45,472 --> 00:31:47,074
Like, you get a second chance.

545
00:31:47,174 --> 00:31:48,409
And look at you. You look great.

546
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:50,812
-Don't, please.
I don't want to hear this.

547
00:31:54,915 --> 00:31:56,818
Do me a favor and don't tell
anyone about me, okay?

548
00:31:57,351 --> 00:32:00,855
-Sure. Yeah. And Em...

549
00:32:04,859 --> 00:32:06,493
I'm so sorry.

550
00:32:06,994 --> 00:32:08,395
-[score intensifies

551
00:32:13,535 --> 00:32:14,702
<i>I'm just worried</i>
<i>about her.</i>

552
00:32:15,537 --> 00:32:16,937
<i>he's going through some stuff.S</i>

553
00:32:17,605 --> 00:32:19,607
And, you know,
it doesn't help that...

554
00:32:20,073 --> 00:32:22,075
that Revival Day

555
00:32:22,209 --> 00:32:25,713
was also our mom's birthday.

556
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:29,082
Our, our late mom's birthday.

557
00:32:29,717 --> 00:32:31,385
I never get used to saying that.

558
00:32:33,588 --> 00:32:35,890
-I'm sorry to hear that, Dana.

559
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:40,895
How long ago did that happen?

560
00:32:42,296 --> 00:32:43,898
If you don't mind, uh,

561
00:32:44,031 --> 00:32:45,800
if you want to talk about it,
you don't--

562
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,367
-Two years.

563
00:32:48,035 --> 00:32:49,436
It was an accident.

564
00:32:51,573 --> 00:32:53,040
Em and I were both in the car,

565
00:32:53,808 --> 00:32:55,075
but Em was driving.

566
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:58,378
-That's awful. Uh...

567
00:32:59,614 --> 00:33:03,283
Losing a parent is very hard,
uh, and I can't imagine,

568
00:33:03,417 --> 00:33:05,085
considering the circumstances,

569
00:33:05,152 --> 00:33:08,489
how traumatic that experience
would have been for both of you.

570
00:33:08,623 --> 00:33:10,424
-Yeah. Thanks.
-So, I'm sorry.

571
00:33:16,931 --> 00:33:18,600
-This is what happens
when we live all like

572
00:33:18,733 --> 00:33:20,300
there's nothing wrong
with zombies.

573
00:33:20,768 --> 00:33:22,336
We're losing our damn way
and for what?

574
00:33:22,937 --> 00:33:24,973
God chose them to die.

575
00:33:25,673 --> 00:33:27,274
<i>Em was always</i>
<i>pretty isolated</i>

576
00:33:27,407 --> 00:33:29,276
<i>because of her condition,</i>
<i>so it was just</i>

577
00:33:29,343 --> 00:33:31,478
always kind of...

578
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:34,281
tough, but then,
after the accident

579
00:33:34,348 --> 00:33:36,951
and all the brutal rehab
I don't think she's

580
00:33:37,017 --> 00:33:38,786
<i>ver fully dealt with any of it.e</i>

581
00:33:42,757 --> 00:33:43,958
-What the--?

582
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:47,762
You bitch.

583
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:51,533
<i>You said</i>
<i>her condition?</i>

584
00:33:51,633 --> 00:33:52,967
<i>Yeah.</i>

585
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,970
<i>She has a disease</i>
<i>where her bones break easily.</i>

586
00:33:57,639 --> 00:33:59,707
-Osteogenesis Imperfecta.

587
00:34:01,308 --> 00:34:03,011
-Yeah. That's the one.
-Yeah?

588
00:34:03,811 --> 00:34:06,280
-Not many people know it.
Type 1. Type 1.

589
00:34:06,346 --> 00:34:07,982
-It's Type 1.
-OI.

590
00:34:08,816 --> 00:34:11,986
-It's still pretty debilitating,
so I understand when you say

591
00:34:12,052 --> 00:34:14,022
that she is acting out.
That makes sense.

592
00:34:14,154 --> 00:34:16,658
<i>nd I, for one, would have a tona</i>
<i>of pent-up frustration...</i>

593
00:34:16,791 --> 00:34:18,392
<i>...and always be, uh,</i>

594
00:34:18,492 --> 00:34:19,827
<i>looking for an outlet.</i>

595
00:34:22,864 --> 00:34:24,131
-That all you got?

596
00:34:29,671 --> 00:34:32,306
<i>- She had it tough.</i>
<i>- She was on a first-name</i>

597
00:34:32,372 --> 00:34:34,509
basis with her doctors and
nurses

598
00:34:34,576 --> 00:34:35,577
by the time she was ten.

599
00:34:39,413 --> 00:34:40,848
<i>But, you know...</i>

600
00:34:41,214 --> 00:34:42,884
<i>no matter what, she always</i>

601
00:34:43,017 --> 00:34:46,186
was able to find levity
in the strangest situations.

602
00:34:47,689 --> 00:34:50,490
<i>It sounds like</i>
her superpower.

603
00:34:50,992 --> 00:34:53,595
How she copes
to get through or push through.

604
00:34:54,696 --> 00:34:56,396
<i>Hm.</i>

605
00:34:56,531 --> 00:34:59,232
Even with how weak she was,
she made it. Yeah.

606
00:35:01,603 --> 00:35:05,439
-She, uh, sounds pretty strong,
actually, Dana.

607
00:35:07,174 --> 00:35:08,876
-Oh, shit. Get out of the way!

608
00:35:09,877 --> 00:35:12,346
Here. I got you.

609
00:35:12,412 --> 00:35:14,549
Sorry

610
00:35:14,682 --> 00:35:16,450
Em! Em!

611
00:35:16,551 --> 00:35:18,019
-I'm okay. I'm good!

612
00:35:20,722 --> 00:35:22,890
She broke
my damn nose.

613
00:35:27,562 --> 00:35:28,963
-Nella?

614
00:35:30,632 --> 00:35:33,801
Em did what where?
Where did she go?

615
00:35:40,407 --> 00:35:41,876
-So, what's your story,
dead girl?

616
00:35:43,578 --> 00:35:45,647
-Cuts. I saw them heal.

617
00:35:46,748 --> 00:35:48,148
Don't worry. Nobody else saw.

618
00:35:51,619 --> 00:35:53,087
Name's Rhodey.

619
00:35:55,255 --> 00:35:56,824
-Em.

620
00:35:59,127 --> 00:36:00,394
You know we can heal?

621
00:36:01,161 --> 00:36:02,997
-And a whole lot more than
a couple of cuts

622
00:36:03,097 --> 00:36:04,132
and broken bones.

623
00:36:04,264 --> 00:36:06,934
But I tend to save
the bigger stuff for my show.

624
00:36:07,434 --> 00:36:10,905
Speaking of, our first show
since lockdown's Saturday.

625
00:36:10,972 --> 00:36:12,807
This place called The Shed.

626
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,474
You should come.

627
00:36:19,781 --> 00:36:21,616
You're a reviver?

628
00:36:21,683 --> 00:36:24,152
-I prefer musician first,
but it's not so bad.

629
00:36:24,284 --> 00:36:26,754
Hell of a lot better
than I was a month ago.

630
00:36:32,994 --> 00:36:34,629
-So...

631
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:39,834
I, uh, kind of need to

632
00:36:40,635 --> 00:36:42,637
avoid the cops for a variety

633
00:36:43,104 --> 00:36:45,807
of reasons right now.
Do you think you could

634
00:36:46,473 --> 00:36:47,875
get me out of here?

635
00:36:48,776 --> 00:36:51,179
-Yeah. I got you.

636
00:36:52,345 --> 00:36:53,815
-Cool.

637
00:36:54,649 --> 00:36:56,316
I'll just be right back.

638
00:37:20,541 --> 00:37:21,909
And there's my car.

639
00:37:22,009 --> 00:37:22,977
-Okay.

640
00:37:23,044 --> 00:37:25,378
-Well, thank you so much
for the ride.

641
00:37:25,513 --> 00:37:26,981
-Of course.

642
00:37:27,682 --> 00:37:29,083
-Could do it again some time.

643
00:37:30,885 --> 00:37:33,020
-Do, like, what?
Just give you a ride?

644
00:37:34,055 --> 00:37:35,355
-No.

645
00:37:36,256 --> 00:37:38,025
We-- Us. The--

646
00:37:39,093 --> 00:37:40,360
Like this.

647
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:44,899
Don't worry about it.

648
00:37:45,833 --> 00:37:47,702
-Okay. Awesome. All right, bye.

649
00:37:47,769 --> 00:37:49,203
-Okay.
-Okay, bye.

650
00:38:18,733 --> 00:38:20,134
-I'm still mad.

651
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:45,626
-What the-- What the hell?

652
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,829
You just can't barge in
like that!

653
00:38:47,929 --> 00:38:49,831
-I can
'cause the door was open, so...

654
00:38:51,799 --> 00:38:53,601
No, don't have reasonable cause.

655
00:38:53,734 --> 00:38:54,902
I'm just gonna...

656
00:38:54,969 --> 00:38:56,971
Listen...

657
00:38:57,104 --> 00:38:59,472
I'm not here for this.
But I can be

658
00:39:00,007 --> 00:39:01,642
if you don't play
your cards right.

659
00:39:02,176 --> 00:39:03,343
Sit down.

660
00:39:12,854 --> 00:39:14,589
-Feel like I'm losing control.

661
00:39:15,022 --> 00:39:17,158
My family.

662
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:18,526
My job.

663
00:39:18,626 --> 00:39:20,094
This town.

664
00:39:20,862 --> 00:39:22,296
-No. No.
-I just...

665
00:39:22,362 --> 00:39:25,867
-No, no, no, no.
Wayne, you are a good egg.

666
00:39:26,701 --> 00:39:28,970
Your job, this town?

667
00:39:30,171 --> 00:39:34,942
They elected you.
They trust you.

668
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:37,712
So now you need to
trust yourself.

669
00:39:38,646 --> 00:39:43,117
So you just get on out there
and do what you think is right.

670
00:39:44,018 --> 00:39:45,887
The rest will work itself out.

671
00:39:46,554 --> 00:39:48,956
Okay? All right?

672
00:39:53,361 --> 00:39:54,494
<i>Evening, Governor.</i>

673
00:39:54,562 --> 00:39:56,364
Sorry to bother you so late.

674
00:39:57,331 --> 00:40:02,236
Well, you know, it's uh,
we're handling it, but, uh...

675
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:04,906
You know,

676
00:40:05,573 --> 00:40:07,008
it's been tough.

677
00:40:07,642 --> 00:40:09,510
And on that note, um,

678
00:40:09,977 --> 00:40:13,147
listen, things have taken
a turn out here and, uh,

679
00:40:14,348 --> 00:40:16,416
you know, you always told me
you owed me one.

680
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,688
You get her this?

681
00:40:20,755 --> 00:40:22,556
- Me?
- Yeah.

682
00:40:22,623 --> 00:40:25,393
-Hell, no!
Who do you think I am?

683
00:40:25,526 --> 00:40:27,528
-I think you got picked up
for possession with intent

684
00:40:27,662 --> 00:40:29,196
last year.
-Oh my God. Okay, okay.

685
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:31,599
Okay, wait. Look.
Look-look-look. Time out.

686
00:40:31,699 --> 00:40:34,035
Those charges are being dropped.

687
00:40:34,602 --> 00:40:36,037
Look, lady, I just...

688
00:40:36,938 --> 00:40:38,906
I just left her some pot
to help with the pain

689
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,909
and for all I know
that's all she does.

690
00:40:42,043 --> 00:40:43,744
And that's all I do, too.

691
00:40:45,212 --> 00:40:47,281
And maybe molly. I don't know.

692
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:52,920
-Then explain it to me.

693
00:40:56,857 --> 00:40:58,125
-Look, she-she...

694
00:40:58,225 --> 00:40:59,860
Like, she wasn't good,
all right?

695
00:40:59,927 --> 00:41:01,896
Like she was all strung out
as hell

696
00:41:02,029 --> 00:41:04,699
and she'd been really depressed
and then it got bad.

697
00:41:04,765 --> 00:41:07,702
And so we were just going to
help her get a quick little fix

698
00:41:07,768 --> 00:41:09,236
and then, and then...

699
00:41:09,937 --> 00:41:11,405
-What do you mean a quick fix?

700
00:41:11,872 --> 00:41:13,074
-What? What? What did you do?

701
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,475
-No, no. It's what she did!

702
00:41:17,912 --> 00:41:19,714
Look, I heard you guys talking.

703
00:41:20,114 --> 00:41:22,316
I know Em is a reviver.

704
00:41:25,386 --> 00:41:28,222
And I knew I shouldn't have
taken her there. Shit!

705
00:41:28,923 --> 00:41:30,825
Shit.
-Taken her where?

706
00:41:31,759 --> 00:41:32,927
Hey!

707
00:41:32,994 --> 00:41:34,996
If you got her something
and she OD'd

708
00:41:35,096 --> 00:41:37,098
she's not the only one
who will be dead.

709
00:41:37,231 --> 00:41:39,400
- Okay.
- So this is your one chance

710
00:41:39,467 --> 00:41:41,669
to come clean.
Where did you take her?

711
00:41:41,769 --> 00:41:43,070
What did she take?
Who gave it to her?

712
00:41:43,137 --> 00:41:45,172
-No, no, wait! Lady, stop.

713
00:41:45,272 --> 00:41:47,508
-Stop calling me lady.
I'm barely older than you!

714
00:41:48,309 --> 00:41:49,810
-You're asking
the wrong questions.

715
00:41:51,912 --> 00:41:53,481
I know who killed Em.
