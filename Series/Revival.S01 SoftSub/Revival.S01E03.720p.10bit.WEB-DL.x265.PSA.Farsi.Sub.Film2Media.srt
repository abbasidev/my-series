<i>Previously on Revival.</i>

2
00:00:05,494 --> 00:00:07,698
- Nice to meet you.
- I need time to detail findings

3
00:00:07,798 --> 00:00:10,100
and observe them
in their environment.

4
00:00:10,167 --> 00:00:12,435
-You want to help me?
Authorize their removal!

5
00:00:12,501 --> 00:00:14,303
Reviver tissue
retains medical issues

6
00:00:14,437 --> 00:00:15,839
present at time of death.

7
00:00:15,972 --> 00:00:18,141
Have you seen my mommy?

8
00:00:18,207 --> 00:00:20,177
Em, isn't this all
kind of connected?

9
00:00:20,643 --> 00:00:23,180
The drugs.
I just saw your den of doom.

10
00:00:23,312 --> 00:00:25,115
Did you hurt yourself?

11
00:00:25,182 --> 00:00:27,117
You're a reviver.

12
00:00:27,184 --> 00:00:28,651
-I prefer musician first.

13
00:00:28,785 --> 00:00:32,055
-Evening, Governor.
Things have taken a turn here.

14
00:00:32,155 --> 00:00:34,124
What the hell
are you doing here, Blaine?

15
00:00:34,191 --> 00:00:36,325
-What did she take?
Who gave it to her?

16
00:00:36,392 --> 00:00:38,494
-I know who killed Em.

17
00:00:42,531 --> 00:00:44,835
- Oh, shit.
- Chill.

18
00:00:44,968 --> 00:00:46,569
-Em, chill?

19
00:00:47,236 --> 00:00:48,872
Uh-huh.

20
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,174
I just want the pills.

21
00:00:54,711 --> 00:00:59,816
-You're saying Em didn't O-D?
You think someone murdered her?

22
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:02,853
-If she had just
followed my lead

23
00:01:02,986 --> 00:01:05,055
everything would've been fine.

24
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:06,857
Okay, talk to me about this

25
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,659
because this is
a mother-clucking masterpiece.

26
00:01:11,094 --> 00:01:13,096
-So, this one's dinner.

27
00:01:13,196 --> 00:01:14,998
<i>Mrs. Check</i>
<i>has three series.</i>

28
00:01:15,065 --> 00:01:16,565
Breakfast, lunch, dinner.

29
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,534
And which one you order
determines

30
00:01:18,601 --> 00:01:22,338
what else you get with it.
You catch my drift?

31
00:01:22,404 --> 00:01:24,373
-Yes!
This isn't that complicated.

32
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,110
-Okay.
Can I please use the bathroom?

33
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,511
-Uh, yeah. Sure.

34
00:01:28,577 --> 00:01:30,379
It's just upstairs
around the corner.

35
00:01:30,513 --> 00:01:33,216
Just be quiet up there.
Don't wake my baby.

36
00:01:33,282 --> 00:01:34,918
- Yes.
- Yes.

37
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:41,057
You have
a thing for cocks.

38
00:01:41,124 --> 00:01:43,592
What is that one?
-Oh, this one's a...

39
00:01:43,727 --> 00:01:45,262
<i>Then, while we're at</i>
<i>the Checks' house,</i>

40
00:01:45,394 --> 00:01:48,765
she goes right upstairs.
While they're sleeping.

41
00:02:05,381 --> 00:02:06,783
Uh, yeah!

42
00:02:06,917 --> 00:02:09,418
<i>- Hey! What're you doing?</i>
- Ah, jeez.

43
00:02:09,485 --> 00:02:11,387
- <i>Grab her!</i>
- Oh my God, oh my God.

44
00:02:11,453 --> 00:02:13,156
Everything okay?

45
00:02:13,256 --> 00:02:14,423
- I'm sorry.
- We got to just--

46
00:02:14,557 --> 00:02:16,559
<i>Get back here,</i>
<i>you little shit!</i>

47
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:18,394
-Oh my God,
oh my God, oh my God!

48
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,096
This is not being cool, Em!

49
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,832
This is the opposite
of being cool!

50
00:02:27,737 --> 00:02:30,907
-And now, because she stole
from the Checks

51
00:02:30,974 --> 00:02:32,242
you think they killed her?

52
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:34,277
-I didn't know Em was dead
and a reviver

53
00:02:34,343 --> 00:02:36,478
until I heard you guys talking,
but, yeah.

54
00:02:36,612 --> 00:02:38,949
Yeah, it all makes sense.
-No, it doesn't!

55
00:02:39,448 --> 00:02:42,185
Em's had her issues
but she would never steal

56
00:02:42,285 --> 00:02:44,087
from a drug dealer.

57
00:02:44,788 --> 00:02:46,823
Sounds like you don't know

58
00:02:46,957 --> 00:02:48,591
your sister, lady.

59
00:03:21,457 --> 00:03:23,059
-There you go.

60
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:25,628
Nice day for a manhunt, right?
-Mm.

61
00:03:25,695 --> 00:03:27,964
-I got a feeling
we're gonna find Arlene today.

62
00:03:28,031 --> 00:03:31,301
Yeah. Oh, what you looking
up the Check Brothers for?

63
00:03:31,368 --> 00:03:33,036
Do you think
they might be hiding Arlene?

64
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:34,536
-No, it's for another case.

65
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:36,572
-Must be a doozey.
-Mm.

66
00:03:36,672 --> 00:03:39,009
-Their rap sheets are as long
as McCray's rat tail.

67
00:03:40,343 --> 00:03:42,511
Though they have been
pretty quiet since Revival Day.

68
00:03:45,514 --> 00:03:47,884
-My guess is 'cause
big brother Anthony

69
00:03:48,018 --> 00:03:50,053
hasn't been around
to tell them what to do.

70
00:03:50,186 --> 00:03:52,488
-Hm? Where's he at then?

71
00:03:52,923 --> 00:03:54,691
-He left town
when Revival Day happened

72
00:03:54,824 --> 00:03:56,592
and can't get back in
because of quarantine.

73
00:03:56,693 --> 00:03:58,695
-Well, that's a blessing then,
yeah?

74
00:03:59,195 --> 00:04:03,033
Don't need any more ding dongs
making life difficult in Wausau.

75
00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:04,701
-There's another option.

76
00:04:07,536 --> 00:04:09,873
He did something
so terrible on Revival Day

77
00:04:10,006 --> 00:04:11,875
that he's been in hiding
ever since.

78
00:04:11,942 --> 00:04:14,344
What kind of terrible?

79
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:17,546
-Murdering someone
that stole from his family.

80
00:04:18,681 --> 00:04:21,084
-Oh, jeez. You think?

81
00:04:24,054 --> 00:04:25,722
-I don't know.

82
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:29,059
- Oof. I hope not.

83
00:04:30,093 --> 00:04:31,560
Oh.

84
00:04:31,627 --> 00:04:34,731
I got a new picture of my, uh,
new girlfriend.

85
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:37,734
Just kidding. It's a cat.

86
00:04:37,801 --> 00:04:39,102
-Yeah.

87
00:04:39,235 --> 00:04:40,704
The real Jordan's dead.

88
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,940
She shouldn't be here.
I bet she doesn't even bleed.

89
00:04:44,074 --> 00:04:46,876
-My mom heard on a radio show
that revivers are demons.

90
00:04:46,943 --> 00:04:48,378
-Maybe she is.
-Your mom needs

91
00:04:48,445 --> 00:04:50,080
to turn off the radio.

92
00:04:56,086 --> 00:05:00,256
-I don't know if I'm supposed
to take them down or leave them.

93
00:05:00,757 --> 00:05:02,491
-I think they're nice.

94
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:05,061
Everyone was really sad
when you died.

95
00:05:06,096 --> 00:05:09,631
-Then why aren't they happy
I'm alive again?

96
00:05:10,133 --> 00:05:12,601
- Watch this.
- Hey, Jordan, show me your hand.

97
00:05:12,668 --> 00:05:14,270
I want to see something.

98
00:05:14,337 --> 00:05:15,637
-Wait! Stop!

99
00:05:15,772 --> 00:05:17,340
Aw!

100
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,309
Ah, God!

101
00:05:19,442 --> 00:05:21,077
What the heck
did you do that for?

102
00:05:21,144 --> 00:05:23,446
You and your reviver freak
are going to pay!

103
00:05:30,453 --> 00:05:32,122
-Come on in! Wipe your feet.

104
00:05:32,588 --> 00:05:34,190
Uh-oh.

105
00:05:34,691 --> 00:05:36,793
Oh! Bless this mess.

106
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,829
Art lover.

107
00:05:40,363 --> 00:05:43,133
-Mrs. Check. Hi. Dana Cypress.

108
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,368
You probably don't remember me.

109
00:05:45,468 --> 00:05:47,103
I went to Durant High
with Andrew.

110
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,872
- Oh. Uh...

111
00:05:48,972 --> 00:05:51,474
Well, judging by that uniform
you got on

112
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,476
you probably got better grades
than he did.

113
00:05:53,542 --> 00:05:55,478
- I'm just kidding.

114
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:59,315
So, you're in the market
for some folk art?

115
00:05:59,382 --> 00:06:02,986
-No. I'm here to investigate
a series of burglaries.

116
00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:04,686
I was wondering
if you could tell me

117
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,290
did this woman
take anything from you,

118
00:06:07,357 --> 00:06:08,458
or your home?

119
00:06:08,525 --> 00:06:09,993
-Oh, heavens to Betsy.

120
00:06:10,126 --> 00:06:14,531
That is that sweet girl that has
a good eye for great art.

121
00:06:14,663 --> 00:06:17,367
No, no, no, no.
It was her pesky friend.

122
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,303
That girl who went
snooping around my house

123
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:21,670
and upset my boy.

124
00:06:21,805 --> 00:06:23,406
This woman?

125
00:06:23,506 --> 00:06:27,977
-Oh...
Yeah, ma'am, that is the one.

126
00:06:28,577 --> 00:06:30,213
You can tell
she's got a black heart

127
00:06:30,346 --> 00:06:31,981
by the look in her eye.

128
00:06:33,183 --> 00:06:34,818
-All right, well,
thank you for your time.

129
00:06:34,884 --> 00:06:37,420
-Oh, wait.
Hang on a second here.

130
00:06:37,987 --> 00:06:40,190
Don't I get nothing
for helping you out?

131
00:06:40,656 --> 00:06:42,258
Squid pro quo?

132
00:06:43,359 --> 00:06:47,030
-Seems fair. Yeah.
Let's do a breakfast chicken.

133
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,332
-Okay. Which one?

134
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,168
Surprise me.

135
00:06:52,235 --> 00:06:55,038
-I got one downstairs
I think you're going to love.

136
00:06:55,105 --> 00:06:57,107
You just hang on.
-Can you please hurry?

137
00:07:04,247 --> 00:07:05,614
-Hm.

138
00:07:08,218 --> 00:07:09,586
-Huh.

139
00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:11,121
Hey, Andrew. Long time.

140
00:07:11,221 --> 00:07:13,256
- I haven't seen you
since you were voted

141
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:16,526
Most Likely to Turn Into A Lez
at graduation.

142
00:07:16,593 --> 00:07:18,228
-What did you win again?

143
00:07:18,361 --> 00:07:20,530
Most Likely to Die in Prison.

144
00:07:20,597 --> 00:07:22,298
That was it.

145
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:29,139
-Free gift. With purchase.

146
00:07:33,076 --> 00:07:35,211
It's for your little boy.

147
00:07:35,278 --> 00:07:39,249
The hero kills everyone
messing with their family.

148
00:07:43,652 --> 00:07:45,388
Back off my family

149
00:07:45,922 --> 00:07:48,124
or there's going to be
one more dead Cypress.

150
00:07:56,966 --> 00:07:59,102
What do you think?

151
00:07:59,769 --> 00:08:01,504
-Oh, it's good, it's good.

152
00:08:01,604 --> 00:08:03,640
-I know.
I know, it's great, isn't it?

153
00:08:21,024 --> 00:08:21,858
-Your son attacked a boy.

154
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,160
I have no choice
but to suspend him

155
00:08:24,294 --> 00:08:26,196
for the rest of the week.
-What happened?

156
00:08:27,263 --> 00:08:28,631
Why did you attack Noah?

157
00:08:28,698 --> 00:08:29,866
-He was going to hurt Jordan

158
00:08:29,966 --> 00:08:32,368
to see if she would heal
because she's a reviver.

159
00:08:36,272 --> 00:08:38,274
-Excuse me,
but where the hell were you?

160
00:08:38,341 --> 00:08:40,476
Kids have the right
to be safe at school.

161
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:41,978
It's your job to
make sure that happens.

162
00:08:42,111 --> 00:08:43,780
-You want to talk about safe?

163
00:08:43,846 --> 00:08:47,050
When nobody, not the mayor,
not those CDC scientists,

164
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,619
not even your own father
can convince people

165
00:08:49,686 --> 00:08:51,821
that they're safe
from these revivers.

166
00:08:51,955 --> 00:08:53,556
People are scared
out of their damn trees.

167
00:08:53,656 --> 00:08:54,958
-Oh, oh. Of who?

168
00:08:55,024 --> 00:08:57,794
Of this little, tiny,
little adorable girl?

169
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,362
You can call me
when she starts pulling out

170
00:08:59,495 --> 00:09:01,831
her own teeth,
but until then calm your tits.

171
00:09:01,965 --> 00:09:03,967
-Dana, I am doing my best.

172
00:09:04,033 --> 00:09:06,502
-Your best sucks. Okay?
Come on, Coop.

173
00:09:06,636 --> 00:09:08,238
-What about Jordan?

174
00:09:08,905 --> 00:09:10,506
-Called her parents
an hour ago.

175
00:09:15,178 --> 00:09:16,746
<i>- ...from there.</i>
<i>- People will talk!</i>

176
00:09:16,846 --> 00:09:18,014
<i>But you don't</i>
<i>want her here, right?</i>

177
00:09:18,147 --> 00:09:19,349
<i>Well, don't put this</i>
<i>all on me!</i>

178
00:09:19,415 --> 00:09:21,217
<i>You feel the same way</i> .

179
00:09:21,351 --> 00:09:22,352
<i>Now, come on!</i>

180
00:09:22,418 --> 00:09:25,521
- It's okay.
- They do that a lot.

181
00:09:26,256 --> 00:09:28,258
Want to go play in my room?
-Yeah.

182
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:45,241
We're not bad people, Dana.

183
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,243
I never said you were.

184
00:09:47,377 --> 00:09:49,512
-We struggled mightily
to have a child.

185
00:09:49,946 --> 00:09:52,716
Scans, tests, procedures.

186
00:09:52,849 --> 00:09:55,084
Doctor said it was
never going to happen for us.

187
00:09:55,218 --> 00:09:57,721
-But we prayed and we prayed

188
00:09:57,854 --> 00:10:00,356
and then, like a miracle
sent from God, she came.

189
00:10:00,423 --> 00:10:04,227
I knew every hair on her head,
every sigh when she slept.

190
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,629
-You're talking about her
like she's dead,

191
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:09,232
but she's very much alive.

192
00:10:10,133 --> 00:10:12,101
And she needs you now,
more than ever.

193
00:10:13,636 --> 00:10:15,271
-That is not our daughter
up there.

194
00:10:19,575 --> 00:10:20,744
-Can we have some cookies?

195
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:21,911
-Mm-hm.

196
00:10:22,045 --> 00:10:24,414
Thanks.

197
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,584
-She came back wrong.

198
00:10:29,753 --> 00:10:31,587
And we've prayed over it,

199
00:10:31,722 --> 00:10:33,323
but our Jordan,

200
00:10:33,423 --> 00:10:35,391
the one God sent us,

201
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,260
is dead.

202
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,302
-I think you've had it
too good.

203
00:10:47,236 --> 00:10:52,175
Because if your daughter
had been sick, or troubled...

204
00:10:53,943 --> 00:10:55,945
and you lived every day knowing

205
00:10:56,412 --> 00:10:59,849
that you might lose her
and then you did.

206
00:11:01,451 --> 00:11:04,120
And then, by some miracle,
she came back.

207
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:09,859
You'd fall to your knees
and weep with joy

208
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:12,495
instead of
crying over what you'd lost.

209
00:11:13,296 --> 00:11:15,799
And, okay, she might not be
what you wish she was,

210
00:11:15,865 --> 00:11:17,500
but she's, she's worth--

211
00:11:18,802 --> 00:11:21,104
- She's worth loving.

212
00:11:25,675 --> 00:11:26,943
I-I...

213
00:11:27,477 --> 00:11:29,512
I hope you can
find your way to do that.

214
00:11:38,488 --> 00:11:40,556
<i>Please leave your message.</i>

215
00:11:40,656 --> 00:11:43,659
-Hi, Em. It's, uh... It's me.

216
00:11:43,794 --> 00:11:45,829
I, I just

217
00:11:45,962 --> 00:11:47,997
wanted to say
I'm thinking about you and...

218
00:11:49,465 --> 00:11:53,636
I really hope you're okay
and please call me back.

219
00:11:56,973 --> 00:11:58,508
-Can we go for milkshakes?

220
00:11:58,641 --> 00:12:00,309
-Milkshakes? Um...

221
00:12:00,376 --> 00:12:02,078
I'm going to drop you off
at Nella's for a bit.

222
00:12:02,178 --> 00:12:04,647
I have has some stuff
to check out for work, okay?

223
00:12:06,182 --> 00:12:08,017
Go sit.

224
00:12:08,151 --> 00:12:09,685
Riparian Zone.

225
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,320
Nine Mile Forest.

226
00:12:11,387 --> 00:12:14,758
No anomalies
in the local flora or fauna.

227
00:12:14,858 --> 00:12:18,561
Mineral composition of water
and soil samples are normal.

228
00:12:18,695 --> 00:12:20,496
Compounds are unremarkable.

229
00:12:20,563 --> 00:12:24,934
Still no viable hypothesis
on the cause of Revival Day.

230
00:12:50,426 --> 00:12:54,397
-Finally got the toxicology
on our reviver brain specimen.

231
00:12:55,398 --> 00:12:57,533
-She is a person.
Please use her name.

232
00:12:58,134 --> 00:13:00,403
-She used to be a person.

233
00:13:00,536 --> 00:13:01,939
Now she is a reviver

234
00:13:02,739 --> 00:13:05,943
who killed her own daughter
and is still at large.

235
00:13:14,383 --> 00:13:16,419
Hello. You look lovely.

236
00:13:16,486 --> 00:13:18,654
-Thank you
-And I have a hypothesis

237
00:13:18,755 --> 00:13:21,090
about Arlene's psychosis
and I'd love to request

238
00:13:21,157 --> 00:13:23,326
a police escort so that I can go
to the Dittman house

239
00:13:23,426 --> 00:13:24,962
and investigate
my theory further.

240
00:13:25,094 --> 00:13:26,095
-Oh, wow.
-Yeah.

241
00:13:26,229 --> 00:13:27,831
-Okey-dokey, Doc.
-Okay.

242
00:13:27,931 --> 00:13:31,133
-Yeah, the only small problemo
is that, um,

243
00:13:31,267 --> 00:13:34,070
well, with everyone out
searching for Arlene,

244
00:13:34,136 --> 00:13:36,272
it's kind of slim pickings
right now.

245
00:13:36,339 --> 00:13:38,742
-Oh.
-Yeah. I could probably get you

246
00:13:38,809 --> 00:13:40,443
McCray right there.

247
00:13:43,145 --> 00:13:45,816
-Oh, well, what about Dana?

248
00:13:45,949 --> 00:13:47,483
-What about Dana?
-Well--

249
00:13:47,617 --> 00:13:49,987
-You'd prefer her company,
would you, mm-hm?

250
00:13:50,119 --> 00:13:52,288
-No, I just saw
that her car was outside,

251
00:13:52,355 --> 00:13:54,123
so I figured
that she was available

252
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:55,792
and that I--
-You get me.

253
00:13:55,926 --> 00:13:57,627
-Oh.
-I'll be your escort.

254
00:13:58,594 --> 00:14:00,029
-It's great.

255
00:14:00,463 --> 00:14:02,465
Okay. Okay.

256
00:14:08,204 --> 00:14:10,172
You're on a well system,
correct?

257
00:14:11,107 --> 00:14:14,778
-Wayne, tell Dr. Ramin

258
00:14:14,845 --> 00:14:18,147
that whatever's he's looking for
he's not going to find it here.

259
00:14:19,515 --> 00:14:21,350
-Can I, uh,
check out your bathroom?

260
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,023
Uh, yeah.

261
00:14:26,689 --> 00:14:29,492
-Hey, Bob, why don't we
let the doctor do his work?

262
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:31,862
Why don't you get me
a cup of coffee, huh?

263
00:14:32,395 --> 00:14:34,664
I'll get the grounds
out of your other freezer.

264
00:14:42,071 --> 00:14:44,041
-Oh. Oh.

265
00:15:08,732 --> 00:15:10,701
-What the hell
do you think you're doing?

266
00:15:12,368 --> 00:15:14,037
-Ah!

267
00:15:14,103 --> 00:15:16,439
Um, hey, I just, um,

268
00:15:16,539 --> 00:15:19,408
I was admiring
the beautiful bay horse.

269
00:15:19,542 --> 00:15:21,912
It's such a,
such a beautiful coat, sir.

270
00:15:22,045 --> 00:15:23,847
-She was my prize horse.

271
00:15:24,547 --> 00:15:26,549
'Til my reviver
bitch mother-in-law killed her

272
00:15:26,682 --> 00:15:28,217
with her bare hands.
-Hey, Bob. Whoa, whoa!

273
00:15:28,284 --> 00:15:29,720
Whoa, whoa!
Calm down, all right?

274
00:15:29,786 --> 00:15:32,055
Let's, uh, let's try to
keep it together, shall we?

275
00:15:32,455 --> 00:15:34,290
Okay, I know you're
burying your wife today,

276
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,559
but, uh, we don't want
to add to the body count.

277
00:15:36,693 --> 00:15:37,894
-He was snooping.

278
00:15:38,028 --> 00:15:40,296
-The CDC has jurisdiction
in Wausau, so...

279
00:15:40,396 --> 00:15:41,898
You best be fixing that,
Wayne.

280
00:15:41,965 --> 00:15:45,201
Unless you want to be
out on your ass next election.

281
00:15:46,302 --> 00:15:47,603
-You almost done here, Doc?

282
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:48,805
-Yeah.

283
00:15:49,305 --> 00:15:51,207
-Good. Let's, uh,

284
00:15:51,273 --> 00:15:53,710
let's get back to
that coffee, huh, Bob.

285
00:15:55,244 --> 00:15:56,813
Let's go back into
the kitchen, Bob.

286
00:15:56,913 --> 00:15:58,949
You, uh,
you got any other weapons

287
00:15:59,082 --> 00:16:00,717
that I don't know about?

288
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,436
-Oh, da, shit.

289
00:16:20,503 --> 00:16:23,606
Oh, shit.

290
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,976
Shoot. Oh.

291
00:16:26,109 --> 00:16:27,744
Oh, shh...

292
00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:38,789
-Hey, uh, sorry,
I didn't want to wake you.

293
00:16:38,855 --> 00:16:40,924
You seemed like
you really needed the rest.

294
00:16:41,657 --> 00:16:44,161
-Uh, it's been a while
since I've slept.

295
00:16:47,931 --> 00:16:50,633
-I don't sleep much.
The darkness weirds me out.

296
00:16:50,767 --> 00:16:53,170
Kind of feels like
I'm reliving my death.

297
00:16:59,042 --> 00:17:00,777
-Um...

298
00:17:00,844 --> 00:17:04,647
How'd you die if you, uh,
don't mind me asking.

299
00:17:08,719 --> 00:17:11,387
-Did you hear about the guy
that jumped into Sunny Vale Lake

300
00:17:11,487 --> 00:17:13,824
and didn't make it but
still rescued that little girl?

301
00:17:14,858 --> 00:17:17,894
-Holy shit. That was you?

302
00:17:17,994 --> 00:17:19,662
-Yeah.
-Wow.

303
00:17:20,296 --> 00:17:22,498
Nah.

304
00:17:23,299 --> 00:17:26,669
That's the story I want to tell.
The truth is...

305
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:29,206
I stabbed myself
through the palm

306
00:17:29,338 --> 00:17:31,373
while coring an avocado
and because I was too punk

307
00:17:31,507 --> 00:17:33,642
to go to the doctor
it got infected and killed me.

308
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,678
-Oh ho. Ew.

309
00:17:35,746 --> 00:17:37,814
-This is supposed to be
a safe space!

310
00:17:37,881 --> 00:17:41,350
-I'm sorry, it's just
for someone so cool,

311
00:17:41,484 --> 00:17:44,587
to have died in such a lame way.

312
00:17:44,687 --> 00:17:46,757
Seven days of antibiotics

313
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,025
and I would've been fine,
but instead.

314
00:17:49,159 --> 00:17:51,027
-Oh-ho!
-Yeah.

315
00:17:51,527 --> 00:17:53,063
Okay, quick,
tell me how you died

316
00:17:53,196 --> 00:17:54,831
and make it sound as dumb
as possible!

317
00:18:02,205 --> 00:18:03,874
You don't have to.

318
00:18:06,843 --> 00:18:08,078
-(whispers) Uh...

319
00:18:08,211 --> 00:18:11,848
My sister and my ex
think I, uh...

320
00:18:13,549 --> 00:18:15,384
think I did it to myself.

321
00:18:16,418 --> 00:18:18,889
I don't think I did, but...

322
00:18:19,421 --> 00:18:21,624
I was on the bridge and I was...

323
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:24,728
high.

324
00:18:24,861 --> 00:18:27,429
And I woke up in Bull Falls,
so...

325
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,568
What if I did? What if...

326
00:18:33,937 --> 00:18:35,538
What if I did jump?

327
00:18:43,579 --> 00:18:46,883
-Lots of people jump
for lots of reasons.

328
00:18:48,785 --> 00:18:53,622
It doesn't make you weak,
or selfish, or a bad person.

329
00:19:01,264 --> 00:19:02,766
-Wait, your...

330
00:19:03,632 --> 00:19:07,771
You got your avocado wound
before you died.

331
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:09,940
If I had jumped,

332
00:19:10,006 --> 00:19:12,309
all my bones would have broken
before I drowned,

333
00:19:12,441 --> 00:19:14,845
or whatever happened to me.

334
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:18,248
But when I woke up,
my bones weren't broken.

335
00:19:18,315 --> 00:19:20,449
-So you didn't fall.
-And I didn't jump.

336
00:19:22,085 --> 00:19:24,120
-Okay. Um...

337
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,923
What else do you remember
about that night?

338
00:19:34,264 --> 00:19:38,134
-You know,
you don't have to do this

339
00:19:38,201 --> 00:19:39,501
and, besides,
don't you have, like,

340
00:19:39,635 --> 00:19:41,437
a band rehearsal
to get ready for?

341
00:19:41,503 --> 00:19:43,874
-I have time. We, we have time.

342
00:19:44,473 --> 00:19:45,674
I want to help you with this.

343
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,643
Help you figure out
what happened.

344
00:19:49,378 --> 00:19:51,815
If that's something you want.

345
00:20:06,662 --> 00:20:08,497
What do all these mean?

346
00:20:08,564 --> 00:20:10,000
-I don't know.

347
00:20:12,335 --> 00:20:13,970
Some are fuzzy,

348
00:20:14,536 --> 00:20:16,505
some are clear.

349
00:20:17,173 --> 00:20:18,474
I-I...

350
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:21,510
I-I-I close my eyes
and really try to focus,

351
00:20:21,644 --> 00:20:24,147
but then they just drift away
and I don't even know

352
00:20:24,214 --> 00:20:25,849
if they're all from the same
place.

353
00:20:26,316 --> 00:20:29,551
What I do know
is I was on the bridge

354
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,922
and something bad happened.

355
00:20:56,713 --> 00:21:00,116
-Terry was
a true-to-life angel.

356
00:21:01,785 --> 00:21:04,087
She even took in
her sick mother,

357
00:21:05,088 --> 00:21:08,892
even when it was a burden
on our marriage.

358
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:15,065
Even when it made her unable
to take care of my needs,

359
00:21:15,198 --> 00:21:16,565
like a wife ought to.

360
00:21:18,201 --> 00:21:19,568
My Terry

361
00:21:19,635 --> 00:21:22,072
put so much light in the world.

362
00:21:22,405 --> 00:21:25,408
- Terry.
- She was a God-fearing woman

363
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:28,378
who loved her family,
her friends

364
00:21:28,445 --> 00:21:30,914
and her dear horse, Sebastian.

365
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:34,818
She didn't deserve to
be taken away from me like that.

366
00:21:36,652 --> 00:21:38,088
-Everybody out!

367
00:21:38,221 --> 00:21:39,588
Arlene, stop!

368
00:21:39,655 --> 00:21:41,424
-...my life.
-Bob!

369
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:43,460
- Devil woman.
- Get out of the way!

370
00:21:43,592 --> 00:21:45,494
Bob! Get down!

371
00:21:54,971 --> 00:21:56,572
Blaine?
What the hell are you doing?

372
00:21:56,638 --> 00:21:58,274
- They carry our prayers...
- Blaine!

373
00:21:58,341 --> 00:21:59,776
-...up to God's throne...
-Stop there!

374
00:21:59,843 --> 00:22:01,510
-...and lay hands on the beast.

375
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:04,613
And through my anointed hand
I condemn you.

376
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,682
Oh, my Terry.

377
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:11,021
-There, in the lake of fire
by your holy soldier, oh, Lord.

378
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:13,622
Terry.

379
00:22:27,871 --> 00:22:29,239
-It's going to take us a while
to separate the bodies,

380
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,175
but we will make sure
that Arlene's body

381
00:22:32,308 --> 00:22:33,810
is held in a secure room.

382
00:22:33,877 --> 00:22:36,645
-Why? You think she's
going to recover from this?

383
00:22:37,013 --> 00:22:38,715
I thought she was
burned to a crisp?

384
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:40,549
-Cremains
are already healing, sir.

385
00:22:40,649 --> 00:22:42,385
Slowly, but nonetheless.

386
00:22:42,852 --> 00:22:44,788
-I knew it was
too good to be true.

387
00:22:44,854 --> 00:22:46,222
-Jesus!

388
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:51,127
Where's Dr. Ramin?

389
00:22:51,194 --> 00:22:53,196
-He said he had
an errand to run this morning.

390
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:58,535
-Blaine Abel's in lockup.
What are we charging him with?

391
00:22:58,667 --> 00:23:00,170
-Public endangerment
for lighting a fire

392
00:23:00,236 --> 00:23:02,539
but it's not going to stick.
-You got to keep that guy

393
00:23:02,671 --> 00:23:04,573
locked up
as a matter of public safety.

394
00:23:04,673 --> 00:23:06,209
You hear what he's saying
on his radio show?

395
00:23:06,342 --> 00:23:09,145
-Yeah. That he was protecting
the public from Arlene.

396
00:23:09,212 --> 00:23:12,681
That's what he
and everybody else will say.

397
00:23:13,649 --> 00:23:15,251
And, you know, he's not wrong.

398
00:23:15,885 --> 00:23:17,720
He did stop her. I couldn't.

399
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,269
Sheriff's office.

400
00:23:33,369 --> 00:23:38,274
You've got a big gosh-darn mess
and no plans to clean it up.

401
00:23:38,374 --> 00:23:39,876
-With all due respect,
Governor,

402
00:23:39,943 --> 00:23:42,545
the reason I called you
is because there is a plan.

403
00:23:42,611 --> 00:23:44,714
My plan. But I cannot execute it

404
00:23:44,781 --> 00:23:46,549
because I'm being drowned
in red tape

405
00:23:46,615 --> 00:23:48,585
by the CDC and the mayor.

406
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:50,386
-Oh, going over my head now,
Wayne.

407
00:23:50,453 --> 00:23:51,721
It's a new low for you.

408
00:23:51,788 --> 00:23:54,090
Governor, I think
we can all agree that

409
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:56,759
stripping the rights
of our citizens is simply not--

410
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:59,796
-What, not what?
For a violent zombie invasion?

411
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:01,564
No, that's not
the right thing to do, is it?

412
00:24:01,698 --> 00:24:03,366
-Jesus Christ, Wayne!
-Language!

413
00:24:03,433 --> 00:24:07,237
-I am barely holding back
an angry mob of zealots

414
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:08,905
screaming for vigilante justice.

415
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:10,740
I need support.

416
00:24:10,807 --> 00:24:13,977
-Yes? Come in.
-Ah, Governor. Sheriff.

417
00:24:14,577 --> 00:24:17,580
Uh, I'm, uh, Dr. Ibrahim Ramin.

418
00:24:17,646 --> 00:24:19,549
I, uh, found traces of mercury

419
00:24:19,616 --> 00:24:21,151
in Arlene Stankiewicz's
brain matter.

420
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,920
At first I thought
it was from the drinking water

421
00:24:23,987 --> 00:24:27,290
at the Dittman home,
but then I found this.

422
00:24:27,423 --> 00:24:30,160
I believe that after Arlene
moved into the homestead,

423
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,395
Mr. Dittman began poisoning her
with mercuric chloride,

424
00:24:32,462 --> 00:24:35,798
which triggered her psychosis
and, uh, her violent events.

425
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:39,068
-He got fed up with Terry
taking care of Arlene over him

426
00:24:39,135 --> 00:24:40,803
so he killed his own
mother-in-law?

427
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,605
-When did you
come up with this, anyway,

428
00:24:42,739 --> 00:24:44,174
'cause I was with you
at the Dittman house.

429
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:45,308
My first time hearing it.

430
00:24:45,441 --> 00:24:48,077
-I'm simply trying to prove
my hypothesis, Governor,

431
00:24:48,144 --> 00:24:50,013
that revivers
aren't inherently violent.

432
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:52,749
-You got any real science
behind that, Doctor?

433
00:24:52,815 --> 00:24:55,084
Because all I'm hearing
are half-baked theories

434
00:24:55,151 --> 00:24:56,953
and wild accusations
against a man

435
00:24:57,086 --> 00:24:58,521
who can no longer
defend himself.

436
00:24:58,621 --> 00:25:00,456
-Oh, you're so hell-bent
on your camp

437
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:03,193
you can't even see the truth!
-This camp can't happen.

438
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:04,527
It can't happen, Governor.

439
00:25:04,627 --> 00:25:06,462
These are people.
They need to be protected.

440
00:25:06,596 --> 00:25:08,164
-We cut the top of her head
off,

441
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:10,633
we baked her to a crisp
and she's still kicking!

442
00:25:10,767 --> 00:25:13,436
That sound like a person to you?
-Name one time in human history

443
00:25:13,503 --> 00:25:16,639
where camps have been better
instead of horrifically worse.

444
00:25:16,706 --> 00:25:18,975
-All right, all right.
Sit down.

445
00:25:21,077 --> 00:25:24,814
Golly, I am choking on
all the testosterone in here.

446
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:29,953
Sheriff, considering she wasn't
even on your

447
00:25:30,019 --> 00:25:31,321
little reviver registry,

448
00:25:31,387 --> 00:25:33,790
sounds to me like
you've got a tracking problem.

449
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:36,726
So how about we start there?

450
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:41,564
Figure out who really is
and isn't a dead citizen.

451
00:25:41,664 --> 00:25:42,999
Or whatever.

452
00:25:43,066 --> 00:25:45,134
Go door-to-door if you have to.

453
00:25:45,201 --> 00:25:46,536
but you've the authority
to smoke out

454
00:25:46,669 --> 00:25:50,139
every reviver in Wausau
so we can tag and monitor them

455
00:25:50,206 --> 00:25:52,842
and avoid ourselves
another Arlene situation.

456
00:25:52,976 --> 00:25:54,844
-Uh, so we're marking them now?

457
00:25:54,978 --> 00:25:56,512
I'm sorry.
Are we serious about this?

458
00:25:56,579 --> 00:25:59,682
-Governor, no, you can't--
-Tag 'em and track 'em.

459
00:26:00,216 --> 00:26:02,986
It works during Shark Week
and it'll work here.

460
00:26:03,686 --> 00:26:05,255
And to your point, Sheriff,

461
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:09,259
if any revivers show
signs of aggression or violence,

462
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:12,362
you have my authority to
remove them to a secure location

463
00:26:12,495 --> 00:26:13,997
of your choosing.
-Oh, wow.

464
00:26:14,063 --> 00:26:16,700
You just legalized
internment camps, Governor.

465
00:26:16,833 --> 00:26:18,434
-I wouldn't use that term.

466
00:26:19,435 --> 00:26:21,871
But big, bold moves

467
00:26:21,938 --> 00:26:25,041
will settle tempers and fears
in this town.

468
00:26:25,108 --> 00:26:26,609
Once people are feeling
safe again

469
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,712
and we have no more
violent outbursts,

470
00:26:28,845 --> 00:26:31,014
we can talk about
lifting measures.

471
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:33,950
Gentlemen.

472
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,055
Okay.

473
00:26:40,356 --> 00:26:42,258
You happy now, Wayne?

474
00:26:43,293 --> 00:26:46,062
Locking up the citizens
you're supposed to protect.

475
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:04,280
-Nella, thank you so much
for watching Cooper.

476
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:05,882
-Ah, you're welcome.

477
00:27:05,948 --> 00:27:07,751
I like the company
before we open.

478
00:27:07,884 --> 00:27:09,585
-What the hell happened here
with Em?

479
00:27:09,652 --> 00:27:11,254
-Your sister seemed fine.

480
00:27:11,722 --> 00:27:14,324
And then, all of a sudden,
she started headbutting Clarice.

481
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:17,093
-Well, the top of the head
is the hardest bone in the body,

482
00:27:17,226 --> 00:27:19,629
so it's kind of her only move.

483
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:21,264
Did she come here with anyone,

484
00:27:21,397 --> 00:27:23,232
or talk to anyone
while she was here?

485
00:27:23,299 --> 00:27:25,435
No, no. She was alone.

486
00:27:25,501 --> 00:27:27,771
I mean, she seemed
a little down in the dumps,

487
00:27:27,904 --> 00:27:29,839
but nothing out of the ordinary.

488
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,240
Before I knew it,

489
00:27:31,307 --> 00:27:32,842
Em had hightailed it
out of here.

490
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,143
-By herself?

491
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:36,012
-Uh, she left with some punk.

492
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:37,480
-Do you mean
like a shitty dude?

493
00:27:37,613 --> 00:27:40,950
-No, I mean a literal punk.
I think he was in a band.

494
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:51,127
-Goddamn it!
Told her, no musicians.

495
00:27:52,763 --> 00:27:54,364
-Maybe it's genetic.

496
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:57,633
I hope not.

497
00:28:15,351 --> 00:28:17,019
Em!

498
00:28:21,624 --> 00:28:23,626
-Cool. Cool look.

499
00:28:23,694 --> 00:28:25,495
-Oh, thanks.

500
00:28:28,866 --> 00:28:30,299
You okay?

501
00:28:30,366 --> 00:28:33,336
-Yeah, I've just never been to
something like this before.

502
00:28:33,469 --> 00:28:34,838
-A punk show?

503
00:28:34,971 --> 00:28:36,572
-No concerts, no clubs.

504
00:28:36,672 --> 00:28:39,810
I've had to avoid any situation
where I could break an arm,

505
00:28:39,877 --> 00:28:43,346
or something.
-Well, you're different now.

506
00:28:43,814 --> 00:28:45,749
Billy Idol once said
punk never dies

507
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,483
and you literally can't, so...

508
00:29:05,435 --> 00:29:07,136
-And with all these
stupid games we play

509
00:29:09,338 --> 00:29:12,074
and all the rules
we need to play them

510
00:29:13,109 --> 00:29:15,578
I forged a blade
for those very rules

511
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:18,916
And another one to slay them

512
00:29:20,016 --> 00:29:22,452
So keep on talking
with your crooked smile

513
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:25,388
and your pathetic
search for worth

514
00:29:26,522 --> 00:29:29,058
'Cause in the desert
of my discontent

515
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,394
There's a river of blood

516
00:29:32,128 --> 00:29:34,530
Stop it, clench your fist

517
00:30:18,341 --> 00:30:20,610
The bloodthirsty
bloodthirsty vultures

518
00:30:20,676 --> 00:30:23,346
form circles around my grave

519
00:30:26,082 --> 00:30:27,683
-Holy shit.

520
00:30:28,351 --> 00:30:30,319
Look at what we got here.

521
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:31,955
-Stop.

522
00:30:32,355 --> 00:30:33,991
Hey, that guy's
messing with my girl!

523
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:35,291
Get him off her!

524
00:30:35,424 --> 00:30:37,293
Adam, get her!

525
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,962
- Em!
- Move!

526
00:30:39,028 --> 00:30:40,296
- Em, come on.
- Hey, Adam!

527
00:30:40,363 --> 00:30:41,965
-You're a dead woman,
Em Cypress!

528
00:30:42,098 --> 00:30:44,133
-Dana?
-Stop! Police!

529
00:30:44,267 --> 00:30:45,601
-Get out back.
-Okay.

530
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,207
No. No, no, no.

531
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:53,509
Get off.

532
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:58,882
Surprise, surprise.

533
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,951
Up we go.

534
00:31:01,018 --> 00:31:02,451
-You're going to regret this,
Cypress.

535
00:31:02,518 --> 00:31:04,320
-I've read your brother's
rap sheet.

536
00:31:04,387 --> 00:31:06,222
This is his third strike.

537
00:31:07,356 --> 00:31:09,325
Looks like he's most likely
to die in prison.

538
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,160
Come on.

539
00:31:13,864 --> 00:31:15,665
You want to join him?

540
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:34,317
-Do you think
those are the guys who...?

541
00:31:34,383 --> 00:31:36,218
Killed me?

542
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:56,039
-We are in the middle of
the road.

543
00:31:56,172 --> 00:31:58,075
We should probably...

544
00:32:00,276 --> 00:32:02,511
- Yeah. Yeah.

545
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:10,053
-You just signed
your own ticket, lady.

546
00:32:10,186 --> 00:32:13,589
I know my rights.
You can't tase me without cause.

547
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:15,558
You can't search me
without a warrant.

548
00:32:15,625 --> 00:32:18,294
-You verbally threatened
a concert-goer.

549
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:21,098
And when I searched you
I was looking for weapons

550
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,866
for my own safety.

551
00:32:23,532 --> 00:32:25,468
And it's just dumb luck
that I found a boatload of drugs

552
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:27,070
that'll keep you in prison
for 25-to-life,

553
00:32:27,203 --> 00:32:28,705
so tell me again
whose ticket got signed?

554
00:32:28,772 --> 00:32:30,874
-My brother's not
going to stand for this!

555
00:32:31,474 --> 00:32:34,077
-Good.
It's what I'm counting on.

556
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:36,046
Oh!

557
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:41,584
Hey!

558
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:44,788
You can't search my phone
without a warrant.

559
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:46,890
-I don't care
what's on your phone.

560
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:48,992
Want you to call your brother.

561
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,560
Why don't you call him?

562
00:32:51,627 --> 00:32:53,229
And put it on speakerphone
while you're at it

563
00:32:53,295 --> 00:32:56,933
'cause I'm really gonna enjoy
listening to Andrew

564
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,770
tell you
and your whole stupid family

565
00:32:59,903 --> 00:33:01,303
how dead meat you are.

566
00:33:01,972 --> 00:33:04,273
-You're not calling Andrew.
You're calling Anthony.

567
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:10,413
Big brother Anthony.

568
00:33:11,347 --> 00:33:13,182
The brains of the operation.

569
00:33:14,084 --> 00:33:16,119
Right?

570
00:33:16,185 --> 00:33:17,620
'Cause if you and Andrew
are going to start a war

571
00:33:17,754 --> 00:33:20,123
with my family you're
going to need his approval.

572
00:33:20,189 --> 00:33:21,825
So, there you go.

573
00:33:24,695 --> 00:33:27,164
Uh, I'm not calling Tony.

574
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:29,933
He's busy.
In New York.

575
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:33,636
-Is that it? Or is it

576
00:33:34,771 --> 00:33:36,773
because you're scared?

577
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:39,675
'Cause he's going to lose
his mind when he finds out

578
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:42,045
you've been arrested.
My guess is that

579
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,181
he told you two losers
to lay low

580
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:46,315
while he was stuck
outside the quarantine zone

581
00:33:46,449 --> 00:33:49,351
and, well, here we are.

582
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,988
You call Anthony

583
00:33:53,222 --> 00:33:54,690
and maybe

584
00:33:55,224 --> 00:33:57,060
all of this goes away.

585
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:00,463
What do you mean?

586
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:05,802
-No, no. I'm willing to
make a deal with Anthony.

587
00:34:06,235 --> 00:34:07,838
Not with you.

588
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:12,976
Come on.

589
00:34:18,148 --> 00:34:19,750
Don't forget
to put it on speaker.

590
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:40,369
- <i>What do you want, grunt?</i>
- Anthony,

591
00:34:40,503 --> 00:34:42,438
This is Deputy Dana Cypress,

592
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:44,440
Mountain Bay County
Sheriff's Department.

593
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,209
I am here with Adam.

594
00:34:46,342 --> 00:34:48,310
Your brother has two
felony convictions

595
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:50,847
already on his record
and I just got him on a third.

596
00:34:50,914 --> 00:34:54,383
I can't help but think
of your poor mother.

597
00:34:54,517 --> 00:34:59,256
But I am willing
to release Adam.

598
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,457
Without charges.

599
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:04,293
I'm willing to give you back
the oxy my sister stole.

600
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:06,263
But I want a truce.

601
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:08,899
The Checks stay away from
the Cypresses

602
00:35:08,965 --> 00:35:10,599
and vice versa.

603
00:35:11,868 --> 00:35:13,536
Squid pro quo.

604
00:35:17,207 --> 00:35:18,809
-Take the deal, bro. Come on.

605
00:35:24,547 --> 00:35:25,916
-Anthony, you have no leverage.

606
00:35:25,982 --> 00:35:28,251
I have your brother,
I know your operation

607
00:35:28,317 --> 00:35:30,954
and I know you killed my sister,
you dirty shits!

608
00:35:32,289 --> 00:35:33,790
-Wait.

609
00:35:33,924 --> 00:35:35,491
Your sister's a reviver?

610
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:38,427
-Oh, you didn't know?
-Of course I didn't know!

611
00:35:38,494 --> 00:35:40,496
-Bullshit. You and your
dirty brothers killed her.

612
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:43,399
-We didn't even know
who she was before tonight.

613
00:35:43,465 --> 00:35:45,434
-At your house,
your brother said

614
00:35:45,568 --> 00:35:47,603
there is going to be
more than one dead Cypress!

615
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:49,638
-Um, he was probably talking
about your mom

616
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:51,842
'cause she died
in that car crash, or whatever.

617
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:54,811
He's an asshole like that!
- <i>Enough!</i>

618
00:35:55,312 --> 00:35:58,114
<i>I'll take the deal.</i>
<i>Cut Adam loose.</i>

619
00:35:58,248 --> 00:35:59,850
-Tell me my family's safe.

620
00:36:00,416 --> 00:36:02,018
<i>-Stay out of our business,</i>

621
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:04,921
<i>then no brother</i>
<i>or associate of mine will move</i>

622
00:36:04,988 --> 00:36:06,857
<i>against your family.</i>

623
00:36:06,957 --> 00:36:08,624
-I want your word.

624
00:36:09,491 --> 00:36:11,795
<i>-Cross my heart</i>
<i>and hope to die.</i>

625
00:36:19,435 --> 00:36:21,037
-Come on.

626
00:36:29,846 --> 00:36:31,214
Huh.

627
00:36:55,138 --> 00:36:56,740
-Coop, I'm home.

628
00:36:57,473 --> 00:37:00,409
-Did you lock up
all the bad guys?

629
00:37:04,147 --> 00:37:05,749
-Yeah, I sure did, buddy.

630
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:48,224
Is this romantic?

631
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:54,463
Shit, sorry,
do I need to be careful

632
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:57,033
hugging you, or...
-I'm not that fragile.

633
00:37:57,734 --> 00:38:00,737
I just didn't get
a lot of hugs growing up.

634
00:38:04,808 --> 00:38:07,476
I still got a lot of love
growing up it's just...

635
00:38:08,044 --> 00:38:10,479
with this condition,
everyone looked at me different.

636
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:13,582
Kind of treated me
like something waiting to break.

637
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:17,087
Or like they were scared
to touch me.

638
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,822
-That must have been tough.

639
00:38:19,621 --> 00:38:21,925
-It is. It-- It was. Um...

640
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:24,761
luckily, as I'm getting older,
it's getting better

641
00:38:24,828 --> 00:38:26,830
and the fractures
and breaks happen

642
00:38:27,297 --> 00:38:31,434
a lot less frequently, but,
as a kid, that was different.

643
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:34,636
-Just because you broke a lot,
doesn't mean you're broken.

644
00:38:35,238 --> 00:38:37,974
-Well, I broke. A lot.

645
00:38:38,108 --> 00:38:39,976
-Mm-hm.

646
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:43,947
-This is from my
fourth rodding surgery.

647
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,816
They couldn't fix the fracture
so they had to put a plate

648
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,584
in my shin.

649
00:38:49,486 --> 00:38:51,955
Oh.

650
00:38:52,022 --> 00:38:55,624
-I've got pins and screws
and plates all over my body.

651
00:38:56,793 --> 00:38:58,328
Touch it if you want.
It's gross.

652
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,534
Ew. (mock disgust)

653
00:39:07,669 --> 00:39:10,173
-Bet it's a nightmare
at airport security.

654
00:39:10,707 --> 00:39:12,541
- I wouldn't know.

655
00:39:13,209 --> 00:39:15,311
-You've never been on a plane?

656
00:39:16,179 --> 00:39:18,448
-If only we could
fly somewhere right now.

657
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:20,483
-As soon as
we can get out of here

658
00:39:20,616 --> 00:39:21,818
I'll take you
wherever you want to go.

659
00:39:21,885 --> 00:39:24,020
-I've never been to the beach.

660
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:26,189
Can we go to the beach,
or is that lame?

661
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:28,324
-That's really lame.

662
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:30,960
I'm kidding.
It can't be lame if you've...

663
00:39:31,361 --> 00:39:33,196
It can't be lame if
you've experienced something

664
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:34,864
that 99.9%

665
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:37,300
of the rest of the world
will never get to.

666
00:39:38,301 --> 00:39:40,170
-Dying and coming back to life.

667
00:39:40,236 --> 00:39:41,637
-And healing.

668
00:39:41,704 --> 00:39:44,174
That feeling when
your flesh and bones break.

669
00:39:44,307 --> 00:39:45,809
-And regenerate at warp speed.

670
00:39:45,875 --> 00:39:48,044
-It's like lightning
rippling through my entire body.

671
00:39:48,178 --> 00:39:52,082
-The irony is,
at least for me, is that...

672
00:39:52,916 --> 00:39:55,684
I had to die to feel alive.

673
00:39:59,823 --> 00:40:01,357
-Will you do something with me?

674
00:40:01,491 --> 00:40:03,093
What?

675
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,732
You want to jump?

676
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:11,600
Are you crazy? No!

677
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:13,169
-Live a little.

678
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:15,371
Rhodey?

679
00:40:15,505 --> 00:40:16,873
Rhodey?!

680
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,942
Rhodey!!

681
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:21,377
Whoo! (joyous)

682
00:40:23,746 --> 00:40:25,882
Feels amazing!

683
00:40:26,416 --> 00:40:28,351
You gotta try it, Em! Come on!

684
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,354
Jump! I got you!

685
00:40:33,923 --> 00:40:37,127
Come on! I believe in you!

686
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:49,906
-Just live a little.

687
00:41:11,261 --> 00:41:12,629
-Stand up. Come on.

688
00:41:15,832 --> 00:41:17,567
You're free to go, Mr. Abel.

689
00:41:19,002 --> 00:41:23,806
Just, uh, know
I'll be watching you.

690
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:26,276
-Okay.

691
00:41:26,342 --> 00:41:29,678
Hey, you know that you and I
want the same thing, right?

692
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,915
You'll discover that eventually.

693
00:41:31,981 --> 00:41:35,785
-You and I, Blaine,
will never want the same thing.

694
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,290
-Might want to think
