1
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:36,337
Watch your six, ma'am.

2
00:00:36,437 --> 00:00:37,838
John Doe coming through.

3
00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:44,477
You know, people ask me
all the time,

4
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:48,382
do I think the folks I put in
the old Firebox 5000 feel it?

5
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:49,683
People ask you that?

6
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:51,719
I tell them about
old Jerry Bowers.

7
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,223
See, he had this crazy condition
where he couldn't feel no pain.

8
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:57,458
Like, you could stab him.

9
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,560
Nothing. Sounds great, right?

10
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:02,730
Well, turns out we actually
need to feel the pain

11
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:03,996
to stay alive.

12
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:06,700
Otherwise, might get a hand
stuck in a woodchipper

13
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,470
and not even know it.
Anyway, let's get this puppy up.

14
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,339
Let's go.

15
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:16,009
Ah! More like John Doughy.
This dude's heavy.

16
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,879
Okay, looking good.

17
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:21,649
Now, pay attention, Miss Toe.

18
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:23,317
It's Tao.

19
00:01:25,653 --> 00:01:27,221
You a vegetarian, Miss Tao?

20
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:29,590
- No.
- 'Cause personally,

21
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,425
I like my chicken oven-roasted.

22
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,501
Do you really think people care
about this kind of stuff?

23
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:42,670
I find most don't
once the tears dry, you know?

24
00:01:43,271 --> 00:01:48,008
It's a segment on unusual jobs
for people in town, so...

25
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:51,845
I would say that this qualifies.

26
00:01:54,282 --> 00:01:55,683
What was that?

27
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:57,351
Is that
supposed to be happening?

28
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,287
Goddamn it, Benny!

29
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,892
Oh my God!
Oh my God! They're alive!

30
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:07,595
Open the door! Open it!

31
00:02:07,695 --> 00:02:09,896
I'm trying!
I gotta override the system!

32
00:02:09,897 --> 00:02:12,200
I can't!
I can't open the door.

33
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,967
Flames will shoot everywhere!
- Hurry up!

34
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:15,603
Oh!

35
00:02:15,703 --> 00:02:16,569
Ah!

36
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:26,314
Oh!

37
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:34,087
What's going on?

38
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:38,459
Oh!

39
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:41,161
This ain't my fault.

40
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,665
Well, this sure as shit
isn't my fault.

41
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:46,567
When is it ever, Dad?

42
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,002
What is that supposed to mean?

43
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:51,171
Of course you're doing this!

44
00:02:51,272 --> 00:02:53,940
You've been running ever since
you fumbled the Blackdeer case.

45
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:57,010
I'm doing what's best for me
and Cooper!

46
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:00,648
I need a fresh start.
We all do.

47
00:03:00,748 --> 00:03:02,615
Oh, that's real nice, kid.

48
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:04,518
Given everything our family
has been through.

49
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:06,520
Damn it!

50
00:03:07,355 --> 00:03:09,022
What the hell is going on?

51
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,858
Look, I... Just stop.

52
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,625
This one's really cool, Mom!

53
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:14,428
Oh, yeah.

54
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:15,829
Wait. What!?

55
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:18,098
Haven't seen this old relic
in a while.

56
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:20,200
There's a reason for that.

57
00:03:20,301 --> 00:03:23,771
I can't. I'm with my daughter
and my grandson right now, okay?

58
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,539
I have to go. You handle it.

59
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:27,474
Still using the family excuse?

60
00:03:27,475 --> 00:03:29,377
What're you gonna do
when Cooper and I are gone?

61
00:03:29,477 --> 00:03:31,345
It's not like
you can just be honest.

62
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:32,713
Oh, that's rich coming from you.

63
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:35,516
Hiding all of this.
Taking away my grandson.

64
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:38,852
Quitting on me. On our town.
On your sister!

65
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:40,820
- Are you serious?
- I am your boss, too!

66
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:42,489
Were you even gonna bother
to tell me?

67
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,057
Ugh. Damn it!

68
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:46,826
Yeah, I guess I forgot
how easy it is to talk to you.

69
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:48,562
Consider this
my two weeks' notice.

70
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:50,964
Yes. Randy did what?

71
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,567
What does that even mean?

72
00:03:54,402 --> 00:03:57,504
Oh, wait. Hold on!

73
00:03:57,505 --> 00:03:59,640
What?

74
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,575
Okay, okay. Slow down.

75
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,344
Yeah, look, I got...

76
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:05,413
What?

77
00:04:05,513 --> 00:04:07,080
Well, where did they go?

78
00:04:09,317 --> 00:04:11,251
How the hell
am I supposed to know?

79
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:14,488
Yes.

80
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,258
Okay, look, I'll handle it.
You stay put, all right?

81
00:04:18,826 --> 00:04:20,661
The apocalypse start
or something? What's going on?

82
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:23,263
I'll get the Seeleys
to watch Cooper.

83
00:04:23,364 --> 00:04:24,932
- I need you.
- What?

84
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:27,601
What is going on, Dad?

85
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:31,772
I don't know, exactly.
Go see Randy. Find out

86
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:33,941
what's got him all worked up.

87
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:36,076
You are still a
Mountain Bay County

88
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:38,946

Jeannie, you there?

96
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:07,808
Jeannie, come in.

97
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,910

Hey.

101
00:05:34,602 --> 00:05:36,470
Can you help me?
- What's going on?

102
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,639
Hello?

103
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:40,574
Officer?
- Where the hell am I?

104
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,309
Don't know what's going on.

105
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:44,845
Is this some kind of a joke?

106
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,247
Oh, why are we here?

107
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,182
Wait! What day is it?

108
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,184
I don't understand.

109
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:52,653
Miss Cypress?

110
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:54,922
You, do you know
what's happening?

111
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,190
- Ma'am?
- Can you help me?

112
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,027
Have you seen my mommy?

113
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,596
I... I want my mommy.

114
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:08,101

150

You know what blows?
Week this all went down,

151
00:07:57,244 --> 00:08:00,047
I was supposed to be visiting
my brother at Northwestern.

152
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:01,914
- And?
- And I could've been

153
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:03,617
in Chicago this whole time.

154
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:05,485
Not, like,
quarantined in goddamn Wausau

155
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:07,120
with a bunch of
lame-ass zombies.

156
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,289
I'm sorry?

157
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:11,491
Well, you know what?
Classes start back up tomorrow

158
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,226
and as excited as I am

159
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,228
to go to school
with a dead person...

160
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,430
Goddamn Shelly should have
stayed that way.

161
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:19,299
Whatever.

162
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:23,170
Um, I need to get
the rest of my shit from my car.

163
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:26,640
And do you think that maybe
we could...

164
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,909
Maybe we could clean this up
a bit?

165
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,578
We could watch a movie after.

166
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:39,319
Ooh. Oh, ooh, ooh. Sorry.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ah!

167
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,655
Hold on, hold on,
I think we just dented your car.

168
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:43,623
- Not mine. Mm.
- Okay. Mm.

169
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:46,526
Uh, should we leave a note?

170
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,028
Absolutely not.

171
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:50,197
Is this your vehicle?

172
00:08:50,297 --> 00:08:51,631
- Dude!
- Yeah?

173
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:53,366
- You talk too much.
- Okay, okay.

174
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,036
Wow. Okay. Huh.

175
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:57,838
Oh, yeah.

176
00:08:57,938 --> 00:08:59,372
- All right. Oh.
- Okay. Ow!

177
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:01,609
- Oh, you all right?
- Yeah, I just banged my foot.

178
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:03,043
- Okay, so we're doing this, huh?
- Yeah.

179
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:04,977
- Might not be a great idea.
- No, I think it's good.

180
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:07,781
Okay, you do...
It's really a big coat. Sorry.

181
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,450
- It's so big. Yeah.
- Yeah, look, okay, this is...

182
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,720
Okay, yeah. This is great.

183
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,187
- Yeah.
- It's great but maybe we could

184
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:17,557
maybe we should talk about
what I do occupationally...

185
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:20,660
Oh, okay. Wow.
This is happening, huh?

186
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:22,395
Been a bad month.
This is my good bra.

187
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:23,964
Don't ruin this.
- All right.

188
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,634
Is that your phone? Okay.

189
00:09:26,734 --> 00:09:29,402
Shit! Shit!

190
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:30,904
It's... babysitter.

191
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:32,839
- Babysit...
- Everything okay?

192
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,042
<i>Yes, Coop's in bed.
Where are you?</i>

193
00:09:35,142 --> 00:09:36,744
- Out. What's up?
<i>- It's Lester.</i>

194
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:38,245
Should I...?

195
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:40,480
<i>- He's found a dead horse.</i>
- And?

196
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,482
<i>Go check it out.
Figure out whose it is.</i>

197
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,653
I'm not on dead animal cleanup
for some old rich prick.

198
00:09:45,753 --> 00:09:49,089
<i>- Damn it, Dana, not now.
- Don't need this shit from you. - I</i>

199
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:51,258
- <i>et over there and deal with it.
- G</i>

200
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:55,228
- That was your babysitter?
- Don't worry about it.

201
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:57,497
- Okay. I'll go. Yeah, it's okay.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

202
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,000
Yeah, I'm gonna go. No worries.

203
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,601
I'm sorry, I'll go.
- Okay.

204
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:03,103
- All right. Coat.
- Coat.

205
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:05,939
- It's cold. Don't forget this.
- Okay. Thanks. Be well.

206
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:08,008
- Yeah. You, too.
- Okay. All right.

207
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,777
Can I call you sometime?

208
00:10:09,877 --> 00:10:11,879
- Okay.
- Yeah.

209
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:14,414
All right. Uh...

210
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,421
Get your number next time!

211
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:16,509
What you think?

212
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:19,446
Ah! What the hell? Lester!

213
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,348
You trying to give me
a heart attack?

214
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:23,350
Of course not.
But if you don't cut out

215
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,318
the trans fats
like I been telling you,

216
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:27,187
you might have one
all on your own.

217
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:29,422
You not read my books?
- Can we skip the trip

218
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,291
down Majak memory lane please?
- I'll have you know, Officer,

219
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:33,593
that even at 82,

220
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,363
I believe my best days
are still ahead of me.

221
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:39,332
In my bestselling book,
A Strong Century, I...

222
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:40,868
Lester.

223
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,469
Horse.
- What do you think killed it?

224
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,272
I don't know.
Did you talk it to death?

225
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:47,007
Ha, ha, ha.

226
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:48,776
Coyotes?

227
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:56,116
Did you drive your truck here?

228
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,051
Yeah.
I pulled it around the bend.

229
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:00,353
Then I was getting
some extra steps in.

230
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,960
What are you doing?

231
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,240
<i>Oh, um...
I don't know. I mean, uh,</i>

232
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:55,608
<i>I tumbled over...</i>

233
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:58,345
<i>and I had a pain
shooting up my arm...</i>

234
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,680
- Cooper! Come on buddy!
- <i>then everything went dark.</i>

235
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:05,285
<i>And then bam! I was awake.
All happened in a blink.</i>

236
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:08,220
- <i>nd hand to God I feel the sam.
- A</i>

237
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:10,958
<i>And I know that
the sheriff's new task force</i>

238
00:13:11,058 --> 00:13:15,095
<i>has a registry
of every revived citizen.</i>

239
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:17,530
<i>I also know that it's safe
to leave our homes.</i>

240
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,466
You're gonna be late.
Get your butt in gear!

241
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:21,434
<i>Visiting
Manning Meats later today</i>

242
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:24,403
<i>for some of this man's
fine brisket.</i>

243
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:26,639
<i>Well, I'm not one
to hurt business, Mr. Mayor,</i>

244
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:29,809
<i>but take it from me:
go light on the red meat.</i>

245
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:33,412
Cooper! We have got to go!

246
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:35,648
- Stop yelling, Mom.
- Jesus!

247
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,385
How long have you
been sitting there?

248
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:41,154
Are you really sure it's okay
for us to go back to school?

249
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:45,825
Yeah, you heard the guy.
Scientist-approved.

250
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:49,261
You know nothing happens
in this town

251
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:51,298
without your grandpa's approval, right?

252
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,501
All right, here you go.

253
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:57,237
Oh. Okay.

254
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,606
Wait, wait, wait!
Let me see you.

255
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:03,443
Hat. Coat. Lunch. Okay. Okay.

256
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:05,678
Okay. Have a good day!

257
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:13,420
Why do we have to
go to school with the zombies?

258
00:14:15,322 --> 00:14:17,324
Do you think she's going to
eat our brains?

259
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:19,026
- Eww.
- Hopefully not.

260
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:21,828
Do you think
she's, like, less smart?

261
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:23,530
Cool! Look at this.

262
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,043
I don't think I look like that.

263
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,947
- Oh, I know.
- You think so?

264
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:43,216
I'm glad you're back.

265
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:58,531
Officer.

266
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,300
Why are we trapped with freaks?

267
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,702
The checkout girl
at Richmonds is one of them.

268
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:07,074
She wore all black
and was super-pale and had these

269
00:15:07,174 --> 00:15:09,076
crazy dark eyes.

270
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:11,211
That's Tina.
She just likes The Cure.

271
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:13,512
There's something
in the woods. I can hear it.

272
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:14,581
I'm telling you.

273
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:17,250
I hear you,
Mrs. Shaw, I do.

274
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:21,054
But if he passed before the 4th,
I don't, uh...

275
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:25,392
Oh! Morning.
Saved one for you.

276
00:15:25,492 --> 00:15:28,428
Jeannie, you are an angel.

277
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:33,032
Are we sure?
He passed one day prior.

278
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:35,534
Just one day.

279
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:37,504
Maybe he's gonna
come back later?

280
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:41,074
I just don't know, Mrs. Shaw.
I'm so sorry.

281
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,278
Mm.

282
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:47,447
You find
your Seabiscuit slayer yet?

283
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,719
Brush your teeth, McCray. God.

284
00:15:54,021 --> 00:15:55,455
Lost my appetite. It's for you.

285
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:57,424
- Oh, thanks.
- You get me that registry?

286
00:15:57,524 --> 00:16:00,293
He's not budging.
Says task force only.

287
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:02,394
Nobody tells me anything
around here.

288
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:04,231
I just want a real case.

289
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:06,966
Yeah, you'll have to take it up
with your dad.

290
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,236
But, right now,
it's snug on his desk.

291
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:12,205
He's hanging onto it
like a tick on a hound.

292
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,773
Jesus Christ!

293
00:16:13,873 --> 00:16:15,975
My kid was bullied
at school this morning.

294
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:17,477
Speak of the devil.

295
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:20,713
Oh, Lord.
They've been at it all morning.

296
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:23,983
Yeah, I'd stay out of
the blast zone if I was you.

297
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:26,286
Feel bad for the new guy.

298
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,156
New guy?
What do you mean new guy?

299
00:16:29,256 --> 00:16:30,657
How do we have a new guy?

300
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,826
CDC folk. This one's
a real cutie patootie.

301
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,163
Oh.

302
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:37,930
- Yeah.
- Oh.

303
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:40,967
Let me introduce myself.

304
00:16:41,068 --> 00:16:42,934
Oh, Dana. Dana.

305
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:44,837
Oh, Wayne, be reasonable!

306
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:48,475
Reasonable? You're the one
who paraded that man out there

307
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:51,178
in some ridiculous
publicity stunt

308
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:53,146
while we're sitting on
a powder keg!

309
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:55,748
Look at them out there!
- I just don't understand

310
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,685
how panicking people is helping.
If anything, I'm helping you.

311
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:01,287
You want to help me?
Authorize their removal.

312
00:17:01,288 --> 00:17:03,490
Why can't you see this
as an opportunity?

313
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,258
It is my job to keep
these people...

314
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,427
Our people! safe!

315
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:10,530
Oh. Why do you have to
make this so hard on yourself?

316
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:14,501
Because when you die, Ken,
you die!

317
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:18,438
- I won't send them away.
- We'll see.

318
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:20,972
You are one stubborn asshole!

319
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:22,442
You'd know.

320
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:26,379
- Dana.
- Mayor.

321
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:33,220
No, Dana, don't go in there.
Come on. No.

322
00:17:33,353 --> 00:17:34,521
- Yeah.
- No.

323
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:36,055
Yeah.

324
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,326
You know, if you want to
send a message to Dillisch,

325
00:17:40,327 --> 00:17:42,829
Lester's got a dead horse
with a head you can mail.

326
00:17:47,334 --> 00:17:48,735
- Dana.
- Mm-hm?

327
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:54,005
This is Dr. Ibrahim Ramin,
our new CDC liaison.

328
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:57,176
This is Officer Dana Cypress.

329
00:17:57,177 --> 00:17:58,844
- Cypress.
- Yeah, it's my daughter.

330
00:17:58,845 --> 00:18:02,348
Okay, yes.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

331
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:04,516
- And also with you.
- Likewise.

332
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:06,085
Yeah, okay, let's wrap it up.

333
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:09,922
Yeah, quickly, sir. I just,
I've only been here for two days

334
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:12,259
and I need the appropriate time
to catch up

335
00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:14,494
and help us figure out
what caused this

336
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:17,096
so if we can please
just communicate,

337
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,266
that would be great
for both parties.

338
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:21,234
What the hell do you think
we're doing now?

339
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:23,002
Yeah, this is communicating,
isn't it?

340
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:27,106
- Uh, yes.
- Mm-hm.

341
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:28,608
- Yes?
- And have you considered

342
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,910
that maybe Revivers
might be dangerous?

343
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:32,878
Right?

344
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:34,781
Uh, yes, of course
we've considered that

345
00:18:34,914 --> 00:18:37,549
considering our, our, yes,
our meticulous approach

346
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,085
and extensive testing,
but to be clear,

347
00:18:39,186 --> 00:18:42,289
we have no data to substantiate
that line of thinking.

348
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:45,525
Uh, all reviver subjects to date
appear normal.

349
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,961
What is going on
between you two right now? Huh?

350
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:50,430
- What?
- What?

351
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:53,700
All I'm saying, sir, is I need
the appropriate time to

352
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,868
detail findings, observe them
in their environment

353
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,937
not just for the
preservation of this community,

354
00:18:58,037 --> 00:19:01,474
but for the vast potential
of this, this discovery.

355
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:04,777
So, just, you know,
I don't step on your toes

356
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:07,647
and you don't step on mine.
Deal, sir?

357
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:11,384
I've got much bigger shoes
than you do, Doctor.

358
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,487
That'll be all for now.
Thank you.

359
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:17,123
Thank you, sir.

360
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,827
Okay.

361
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:26,165
Did you sleep with him?

362
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:27,934
What?

363
00:19:29,236 --> 00:19:30,503
Dad!

364
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:33,439
Anyway, moving on.
Did you take care of the horse?

365
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,308
Uh-huh.
Randy's on the necropsy.

366
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:37,644
We're just figuring out
where it came from.

367
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:39,312
Finish up quick, okay,

368
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:41,281
'cause we're stretched
pretty thin as it is.

369
00:19:55,094 --> 00:19:56,696
Myles Miller?

370
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:03,202
Mm.

371
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:07,507
Helen, how you doing?
How's Bill and the gang?

372
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:10,141
<i>Hi, Dana.
Uh, they're great. Yeah.</i>

373
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:12,779
<i>Do you have a minute?</i>
- Always, for you. Yes.

374
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:14,980
<i>You know how excited
everyone was to make you</i>

375
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:17,684
<i>a part of the Paper Street
security team?</i>

376
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:19,651
Yeah, yeah.
What do you mean "was"?

377
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:22,054
<i>I'm sorry but we can't
keep holding the position.</i>

378
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:24,123
<i>I know you're stuck there,
but it's been over a month</i>

379
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,393
<i>and we can't keep waiting.
We have to move to</i>

380
00:20:26,526 --> 00:20:28,327
<i>another candidate
who's available.</i>

381
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:29,729
<i>I'm really sorry, Dana.</i>

382
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:32,365
Helen! Hel...

383
00:20:52,552 --> 00:20:54,654
- Howdy-ho, Officer Cypress.
- Jesus.

384
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:57,156
Forget to put some glitter
in your coffee this morning?

385
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,826
What do you want?

386
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:01,761
All right, no horsing around.
Uh...

387
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:05,332
Oh, come on! That was a joke.
'Cause you gave us a horse to...

388
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:08,535
- Randy!
- Yeah, so the horse, uh...

389
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:11,203
I lost it.

390
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:13,940
- What do you mean you lost it?
- All right.

391
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:16,743
I was minding my own business,
doing my job, right?

392
00:21:16,843 --> 00:21:19,210
And then these CDC folks
swooped in all fast like

393
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:21,681
and took it!
Was some ET shit.

394
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:26,753
So, yeah, you might want to
check in with them

395
00:21:26,853 --> 00:21:29,121
if you have the time.

396
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,626
Nothing but time.

397
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:44,871
You'll be fine.

398
00:21:45,705 --> 00:21:47,540
Unfortunately,
that's the last person

399
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,809
I can meet with today.

400
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:51,578
Thanks.

401
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,889
I'm sorry.

402
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:04,657
I'm in a rush
and really don't have ti...

403
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:09,996
Uh, Miss Cypress.

404
00:22:10,963 --> 00:22:12,832
I really must be on my way.

405
00:22:12,932 --> 00:22:14,834
Nope. No.

406
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:17,169
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm doing what I have to do.

407
00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:20,407
- Please just...
- I've been texting. Calling.

408
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:22,609
Emailing.
You're done ignoring me.

409
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:26,846
Fine. We'll meet.

410
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,916
Tonight. Our spot.

411
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,451
You'd better be there.

412
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:34,654
I will. I promise. But Em...

413
00:22:36,623 --> 00:22:38,257
We have to be careful.

414
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,960
You were getting a little scary.

415
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:46,098
What...
What do you mean, "scary?"

416
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:49,035
Not now. Not here.

417
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:52,304
Tonight, seven o'clock.

418
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,707
Okay?

419
00:23:41,521 --> 00:23:42,922
Uh, Dana?

420
00:23:43,055 --> 00:23:44,824
- Hey. There you are.
- Yeah.

421
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,993
What can I, uh,
what can I do for you?

422
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,996
- Can we talk?
- I... Sure.

423
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:53,099
- Great.
- Yeah. Just step into my, uh...

424
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:54,834
My office.

425
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,936
Huh. Right?

426
00:23:57,036 --> 00:24:00,272
Yeah, wow. It's so big.

427
00:24:00,406 --> 00:24:02,041
Hey.

428
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:05,177
We need to, uh,
evacuate the area. Thanks.

429
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,045
Sorry.
She's actually really nice.

430
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:09,381
She's just... She's here for me.

431
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:12,919
Let's, let's just
not make this a thing.

432
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:14,854
I had been stuck inside
for a long time

433
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:16,623
and lockdown made me...

434
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:20,459
You know,
it had an effect on my...

435
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,461
Libido.

436
00:24:22,562 --> 00:24:23,963
Gross.

437
00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:27,534
Yeah, can we just keep this...
professional?

438
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:29,268
Start over,
keep it professional.

439
00:24:30,737 --> 00:24:32,972
So, why would you take my horse?

440
00:24:33,105 --> 00:24:35,975
Oh, just don't...
Yeah. Don't touch that.

441
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:37,777
That's evidence. Thank you.

442
00:24:37,877 --> 00:24:40,379
Usually, you keep evidence
in a bag.

443
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:43,650
We found an anomaly
inside the horse.

444
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:46,385
We found teeth.
Uh, human teeth.

445
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:50,156
You found yours in the horse?
Mine were just in the snow.

446
00:24:50,256 --> 00:24:53,793
Well, what do you mean mine?
There's more?

447
00:24:53,893 --> 00:24:56,395
Eh. Keep them
in this evidence bag.

448
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:01,300
Um...

449
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,135
Okay.

450
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:10,743
Um...

451
00:25:13,412 --> 00:25:15,014
Ugh.

452
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:16,916
Oh my God.

453
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:23,923
These are identical.
Um, your teeth

454
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,424
and these teeth are identical.

455
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:29,195
These are a set of right
homologous lateral incisors

456
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:31,530
and these are superior
right canines,

457
00:25:31,631 --> 00:25:34,767
all with pristine
dental clarity.

458
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:38,037
And I believe are derived
from the same subject.

459
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,538
What?

460
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:42,308
Um, okay, if I, uh...

461
00:25:45,678 --> 00:25:47,513
Okay, if I show you something,

462
00:25:47,614 --> 00:25:50,349
you'll keep it
between us. Right?

463
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,985
- Scout's honor.
- Okay, that's, uh...

464
00:25:53,986 --> 00:25:57,624
That's...
That's not what that is. Um...

465
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,894
Okay, this is
reviver tissue, okay?

466
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:07,734
Look at this.

467
00:26:07,834 --> 00:26:10,001
See?

468
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:11,704
- Oh my God.
- Yeah.

469
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:15,975
Okay, now,
this only works post mortem.

470
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:18,410
Anything pre-existing at
the time of death will remain.

471
00:26:18,544 --> 00:26:21,247
That's why you see
some Revivers with scars,

472
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:24,182
or some with ailments and more,
but anything new,

473
00:26:24,183 --> 00:26:26,753
their cellular structure
can regenerate.

474
00:26:26,853 --> 00:26:28,254
Granted, wound severity
will dictate

475
00:26:28,387 --> 00:26:30,188
the pace of healing, but...
- So, you're saying

476
00:26:30,189 --> 00:26:34,326
that the teeth healed.
Well, regrew.

477
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:37,028
Yes. Yes.

478
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:39,165
Okay. Holy shit.
This makes sense.

479
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:40,900
It does to you?

480
00:26:42,735 --> 00:26:45,237
<i>Dana.</i>

481
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:47,106
Lester, what truck do you drive?

482
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:50,943
<i>Oh, well, I've got the F-150
3-liter Power Stroke V6.</i>

483
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:53,946
<i>Diesel, of course.
I used to have the 350 7-li...</i>

484
00:26:54,046 --> 00:26:56,115
- Oh, shit.
- That's rude.

485
00:26:56,248 --> 00:26:59,118
Okay, the tracks at the scene
weren't from Lester's truck.

486
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:01,120
And the coyotes
that tore into the horse?

487
00:27:01,253 --> 00:27:03,054
It was already dead by then.
They wouldn't go after

488
00:27:03,055 --> 00:27:04,924
a living horse.
No! No way.

489
00:27:05,024 --> 00:27:06,525
Someone was hiding the horse?

490
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,227
Someone left the horse
knowing animals would get to it

491
00:27:09,228 --> 00:27:11,263
and cover up
what really happened.

492
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:13,800
Think about it.
This is someone strong enough

493
00:27:13,933 --> 00:27:17,402
to bite through a horse!
Kill a horse!

494
00:27:17,403 --> 00:27:19,471
And now you're saying
they can heal.

495
00:27:19,605 --> 00:27:21,440
- Yeah.
- Holy shit, man!

496
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,476
I don't know how much experience
you have moving a horse,

497
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:25,978
but that's like a 1,000 pounds!

498
00:27:26,078 --> 00:27:29,816
So someone went to a lot
of trouble to do this.

499
00:27:29,916 --> 00:27:31,650
But not because
they were hiding a horse.

500
00:27:31,784 --> 00:27:33,552
They were hiding a Reviver.

501
00:27:35,888 --> 00:27:37,489
Oh. Okay.

502
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:42,228
Okay, um, if this is true,
if there is some rogue,

503
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:45,331
super-strong, animal-hating
Reviver on our hands

504
00:27:45,464 --> 00:27:46,833
- Shh.
- If that's...

505
00:27:46,933 --> 00:27:49,635
If that's true,
I need to see it.

506
00:27:49,736 --> 00:27:51,738
- Same.
- Yeah. Okay.

507
00:27:51,838 --> 00:27:53,005
All right. I'm on it.

508
00:27:53,139 --> 00:27:55,174
Whatever makes them different
could be the key

509
00:27:55,274 --> 00:27:58,845
to unlocking everything
about what happened here.

510
00:27:58,978 --> 00:28:02,348
- Copy that.
- Oh. Dana, please.

511
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:04,950
This is still evidence.
- What is it, anyway?

512
00:28:04,951 --> 00:28:06,485
This is a railway spike.

513
00:28:06,585 --> 00:28:08,988
It's a part of the animal trap
that caught your coyote.

514
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,522
I mean, it was all handmade.

515
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:12,958
It was
a pretty ingenious design.

516
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:15,027
Um, but this? I don't know.
I doubt it's from

517
00:28:15,127 --> 00:28:17,997
any active track
based on its age.

518
00:28:20,132 --> 00:28:22,534
No, it's probably
from a really old one.

519
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:25,337
- Yeah.
- Got a train to catch!

520
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:26,805
Okay.

521
00:28:26,806 --> 00:28:28,306
Huh?

522
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:30,141
Look, I'll just...

523
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:32,044
I'm sorry, sir.
There are no exceptions.

524
00:28:32,178 --> 00:28:35,114
<i>Oh, now,
that there's a longshot, Dana.</i>

525
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:37,884
There were a bunch of these
little D-I-Y traps not far from

526
00:28:37,984 --> 00:28:40,052
where I found the horse.
<i>- Yeah?</i>

527
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:42,054
Now riddle me this:

528
00:28:42,154 --> 00:28:45,892
there are 47 names
on the reviver registry, right?

529
00:28:46,025 --> 00:28:48,227
<i>On the... Wait.
How did you get the...</i>

530
00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:50,362
<i>You know what? I don't want
to know. I don't want to know.</i>

531
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:52,231
How do we know
that's all of them?

532
00:28:52,331 --> 00:28:57,069
I mean, the quarantine zone
is, like, 45,000 people.

533
00:28:57,169 --> 00:28:59,170
I mean, someone could've
died in their sleep

534
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:02,474
and woke up and not even know
they're a Reviver.

535
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:03,976
<i>I suppose. Yeah.</i>

536
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:05,744
What about
this Myles Miller guy?

537
00:29:05,878 --> 00:29:07,814
Oh, you think
he's your horse fella?

538
00:29:07,914 --> 00:29:09,347
Well, he's the only Reviver
we know of

539
00:29:09,348 --> 00:29:11,984
with a violent history.
How did he die?

540
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:13,652
<i>Uh, he was on a life sentence</i>

541
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,088
<i>and he died of a stroke
in prison, I think.</i>

542
00:29:16,188 --> 00:29:18,023
And now he's out
and you can't find him.

543
00:29:18,024 --> 00:29:20,927
<i>If this is your guy, Dana,
please be careful.</i>

544
00:29:35,741 --> 00:29:38,077
Oh, God.

545
00:29:56,028 --> 00:29:57,629
- Goddamn it, Ken.
- <i>Dad?</i>

546
00:29:59,098 --> 00:30:02,234
- Martha?
- No one calls me Martha anymore.

547
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,370
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

548
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,605
Yeah, I'm fine.

549
00:30:06,705 --> 00:30:08,307
I just...

550
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:10,609
I'm just, uh...

551
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:11,978
Where have you been?

552
00:30:12,078 --> 00:30:13,244
I've called you,
like, three times.

553
00:30:13,245 --> 00:30:14,813
Why are you ignoring me?

554
00:30:14,947 --> 00:30:16,482
<i>Did something happen?</i>
- Dad!

555
00:30:16,615 --> 00:30:18,985
Look, we had an agreement, remember?

556
00:30:19,118 --> 00:30:21,086
You can't be out running wild
in your condition.

557
00:30:21,087 --> 00:30:22,821
It's nothing.

558
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:25,291
I'm fine.

559
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:27,326
I just wanted to call
to let you know I was all right

560
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:30,462
and that I'll be better
about calling, okay?

561
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,000
Gotta go.

562
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,029
<i>This is Professor Weimer.</i>

563
00:31:03,129 --> 00:31:04,795
<i>Leave a mess...</i>

564
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,747
Hello! Myles Miller?

565
00:32:54,573 --> 00:32:56,208
Hello?

566
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,318
I ain't going back,
you hear me!?

567
00:33:08,754 --> 00:33:10,322
You're not taking me again!
- Ah!

568
00:33:10,422 --> 00:33:11,457
Ah!

569
00:33:17,263 --> 00:33:20,499
Ah.
- Jesus Christ, lady!

570
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:22,168
Who's out here with you?

571
00:33:22,268 --> 00:33:24,570
You got a truck?
How'd you move the horse?

572
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:25,737
A horse?

573
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,506
What the hell
are you talking about, lady?

574
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:29,508
Ain't nobody out here but me!

575
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,843
Get this off of me, please!

576
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:34,846
Jeez. Ah. Ah!

577
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:38,517
Do it for God's sakes!

578
00:33:47,093 --> 00:33:48,660
Myles Miller?

579
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,362
No.

580
00:33:51,297 --> 00:33:53,699
No, I'm not him.
- I think you might be.

581
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:55,701
No. Goddamn it!

582
00:33:55,801 --> 00:33:58,870
Why can't you all just leave me
the hell alone, huh?

583
00:33:59,004 --> 00:34:00,439
- Two days ago...
- I did my time.

584
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:01,840
- You were in the forest.
- Did it.

585
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:04,710
Right over there.
Where the horse was moved.

586
00:34:04,843 --> 00:34:06,977
What!? Lady, I do not know
what the hell

587
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:09,448
you are talking about, okay?
I ain't with no horse.

588
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:11,217
- Help with the horse.
- No people. No nothing.

589
00:34:11,317 --> 00:34:14,620
- Moved a horse.
- You got a thing for horses?

590
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,724
Yeah, you do. You horse people
are so damn weird.

591
00:34:18,824 --> 00:34:19,990
Your teeth.

592
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:25,030
Your teeth
been growing back since...

593
00:34:25,131 --> 00:34:26,331
What?

594
00:34:26,332 --> 00:34:28,467
They look like they've been
growing back to you?

595
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:29,835
Huh?

596
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,304
No. Come on.

597
00:34:33,705 --> 00:34:35,574
Hey, hey! Wait, hold on.
Hold on, hold on.

598
00:34:35,707 --> 00:34:37,243
You're looking for a truck, right?

599
00:34:37,343 --> 00:34:38,644
See, I saw a truck;
I heard a truck.

600
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:40,845
Went vroom-vroom few nights past
just like you said.

601
00:34:40,846 --> 00:34:43,815
It was a red truck,
a dually with four wheels on it

602
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,585
and all that.
Yeah, and they had a tarp on it.

603
00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:49,421
I bet they moved your horsey.
I bet that... Hey, wait.

604
00:34:49,555 --> 00:34:51,490
You looking for a horse?
I'll get you a horsey, okay?

605
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:54,393
I'm a real good tracker,
real good hunter. Yeah.

606
00:34:54,493 --> 00:34:57,763
Whatever horse shit you're into,
I got you.

607
00:34:58,664 --> 00:35:00,232
Great.
Well, you're under arrest.

608
00:35:05,671 --> 00:35:06,538
Dad!

609
00:35:07,206 --> 00:35:08,840
Dad?

610
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,875
- Where's my guy?
- Papa!

611
00:35:10,876 --> 00:35:14,246
There he is! Bring it in.
Oh! Come on.

612
00:35:14,346 --> 00:35:16,114
Nice to see you, pal.

613
00:35:16,215 --> 00:35:17,715
What's wrong with you?

614
00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:19,685
Hey, you're still
not off the hook for that stunt

615
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:21,086
you pulled last night,
by the way.

616
00:35:21,187 --> 00:35:23,955
You mean catching a criminal
you couldn't even find?

617
00:35:24,089 --> 00:35:25,791
That stunt?

618
00:35:25,891 --> 00:35:27,859
Yeah. So how long
are you going to be?

619
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,528
Couple of the farms
are on the outskirts

620
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:31,763
of the quarantined zone,
but shouldn't take too long.

621
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:33,031
All right.

622
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,467
You have fun and how about
you don't load him up

623
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:37,235
on sugar this time?
- Oh, really?

624
00:35:37,236 --> 00:35:38,569
- Yeah.
- Says the person who's going

625
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:41,139
straight to Friedman's
for a chocolate glazed.

626
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,641
You don't know me.

627
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:48,480
Mm.

628
00:35:50,749 --> 00:35:52,384
Mm.

629
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:09,099
Em!

630
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:15,073
Em.
- Dana?

631
00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:17,643
What the hell?

632
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,177
Wait.

633
00:36:19,311 --> 00:36:21,012
What the hell
are you doing here?

634
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,182
You know how risky it is for
you to be out here like this!

635
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:27,619
- I just dozed off.
- You dozed off?

636
00:36:36,262 --> 00:36:37,863
Could you just take me home?

637
00:36:45,971 --> 00:36:47,706
So, um...

638
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:50,641
we're not going to talk about
you adopting some kind of

639
00:36:50,642 --> 00:36:52,811
vagrant lifestyle, hm?

640
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,547
Should I circle back
and look for your bindle?

641
00:36:56,114 --> 00:36:57,349
What's a bindle?

642
00:36:57,449 --> 00:36:59,285
Em, no one's seen you for weeks.

643
00:36:59,385 --> 00:37:01,019
Dad's been freaking out.

644
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,489
The dead have come back to life!
Can't be finding you out here

645
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:06,124
sleeping on a bench, man.

646
00:37:07,826 --> 00:37:09,660
Did something happen,
maybe with a guy?

647
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:12,163
You can tell me.
- Jesus, Dana, please. It's...

648
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:14,900
Enough with the questions.
I'm just...

649
00:37:19,405 --> 00:37:21,072
I'm fine.

650
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,809
Okay.

651
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:26,645
'Cause you know your big sister
has a Taser and a gun.

652
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:28,980
And a low moral bar.

653
00:37:31,049 --> 00:37:32,818
What were you doing
way out there anyway?

654
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:36,254
I was working a case.
Well, I was trying to.

655
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:38,424
Anything fun?

656
00:37:38,557 --> 00:37:40,592
For a second there,
I thought so,

657
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:43,161
but now all I have
is a dead horse and a dead end.

658
00:37:43,562 --> 00:37:45,029
You want some company?

659
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,864
No, I've got to get you
back to the dorm

660
00:37:46,865 --> 00:37:48,934
before you break a femur,
or something.

661
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,942
Sorry.

662
00:38:01,447 --> 00:38:03,114
Can I?

663
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:07,118
Yes.

664
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:13,091
Mm.

665
00:38:13,191 --> 00:38:15,594
Remember the weekend
you broke up with Derek?

666
00:38:15,694 --> 00:38:18,263
Mom got us a whole box of these
and then we got sick.

667
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:22,133
It was the first time I watched
Evil Dead 2.

668
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:24,135
Oh!

669
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:26,037
No, yeah, I remember that.

670
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:30,074
That was the first time
I caught Derek cheating on me.

671
00:38:30,075 --> 00:38:31,810
Asshole.

672
00:38:36,281 --> 00:38:40,318
I swore I was leaving Wausau
for good that time.

673
00:38:40,419 --> 00:38:42,621
I was done. I was out!

674
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:46,057
Ten years later I'm still here.

675
00:38:46,792 --> 00:38:50,161
Yeah. You always said
you would stay in Myrtle Beach.

676
00:38:59,505 --> 00:39:02,007
You know I did want to go
on that trip with you, right?

677
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:05,977
It's okay. You got pregnant
with Cooper and...

678
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:09,180
life had other plans.

679
00:39:21,126 --> 00:39:23,995
Listen, I know we haven't been
as close lately and...

680
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,033
Well, you can say no,

681
00:39:28,534 --> 00:39:30,201
but what if,

682
00:39:31,169 --> 00:39:34,039
after all this craziness end
and they lift the quarantine...

683
00:39:34,172 --> 00:39:35,707
Wait. You want to
go to the beach?

684
00:39:35,841 --> 00:39:37,776
'Cause I've still never been.

685
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:41,780
Let's go on an adventure
together.

686
00:39:43,549 --> 00:39:45,050
I'd love that.

687
00:39:45,183 --> 00:39:47,819
All right.
Well, let's go plan it.

688
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,356
- Like right now?
- Yeah. Why not?

689
00:39:51,457 --> 00:39:52,891
Well, what about your work?

690
00:39:53,024 --> 00:39:54,992
Who cares?
Farms aren't going anywhere.

691
00:39:54,993 --> 00:39:56,728
Dad's watching Cooper.
Let's do it!

692
00:40:03,869 --> 00:40:06,738
- Perfect.
- Mom usually lets me flip it.

693
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:08,807
Yeah, well, in my house,

694
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:11,643
I do all the cooking then
I don't wind up with a big mess.

695
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:13,712
But our kitchen's
already a mess.

696
00:40:13,812 --> 00:40:15,714
Is that a fact?

697
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:22,420
The station had better be
in flames.

698
00:40:22,521 --> 00:40:25,256
<i>No flames here,
but I do have a fire</i>

699
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:27,692
<i>that needs putting out
at Opal Shaw's house.</i>

700
00:40:27,693 --> 00:40:29,895
<i>Neighbors heard yelling
and it seems like</i>

701
00:40:29,995 --> 00:40:32,330
<i>she's not answering the door
or her phone.</i>

702
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,566
<i>Yeah, she's been having
a tough go of it.</i>

703
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:36,033
They're gonna burn, Grandpa!

704
00:40:36,034 --> 00:40:38,336
<i>Could use
a familiar face, you know?</i>

705
00:40:48,547 --> 00:40:50,348
Stay in the car.

706
00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:14,039
Hello, Officer!

707
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:20,244
Morning there, Officer.

708
00:41:20,245 --> 00:41:24,650
I'm, uh, Mrs. Dittman.
This is Mr. Dittman.

709
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:26,416
How can we help you?
- Officer Cypress.

710
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:27,819
I'm looking for a horse.

711
00:41:27,919 --> 00:41:29,821
A horse?

712
00:41:29,955 --> 00:41:32,757
I can tell you right now
we got no missing horse here.

713
00:41:32,758 --> 00:41:34,993
- Yeah. All accounted for. Yeah.
- Yeah. Accounted for.

714
00:41:35,093 --> 00:41:37,896
Uh, that's nothing.

715
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:40,231
That's just the animals
knocking about is all.

716
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,935
Uh, wait!
Officer.

717
00:41:44,936 --> 00:41:46,905
- Yeah, Officer?
- Officer!

718
00:41:53,411 --> 00:41:55,280
All right, buddy. You good?

719
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,850
You hang tight. Wait here.
I'll be right back.

720
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:20,205
Mrs. Shaw! It's the sheriff.
Could you please open the door?

721
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:26,544
That's a big chain.

722
00:42:29,781 --> 00:42:31,982
Ah! Sorry, Sheriff.

723
00:42:31,983 --> 00:42:33,619
Didn't hear you there.

724
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:35,053
- Sure.
- What's all the fuss about?

725
00:42:35,186 --> 00:42:38,056
Good morning, Opal.
I'm just doing a wellness check.

726
00:42:38,156 --> 00:42:40,959
We've received a few phone calls
about a disturbance here.

727
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:42,993
Loud noises and yelling.

728
00:42:42,994 --> 00:42:48,299
From here? Oh, no, no, no, no.
You must be mistaken.

729
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:51,236
It's not what you think.
She's not all there.

730
00:42:51,336 --> 00:42:53,503
She kept running out.
It's for her own safety!

731
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:55,373
All right. Stay back.

732
00:43:00,746 --> 00:43:03,081
Would you mind if I
came in and took a look around?

733
00:43:03,214 --> 00:43:05,550
No need for that, Sheriff.

734
00:43:05,651 --> 00:43:07,919
I'm not decent at the moment,

735
00:43:08,019 --> 00:43:12,590
but besides, everything's fine.
Just fine.

736
00:43:15,761 --> 00:43:18,028
If you don't mind
I insist, please.

737
00:43:18,029 --> 00:43:20,766
No! You don't understand.

738
00:43:24,703 --> 00:43:26,171
Please? Please?

739
00:43:29,174 --> 00:43:30,942
It, it's fine.

740
00:43:31,042 --> 00:43:33,444
We're, we're, we're,
we're working it out!

741
00:43:33,578 --> 00:43:35,446
We?

742
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:46,792
Oh, good Christ!

743
00:43:46,892 --> 00:43:48,794
He, he, he's coming back.

744
00:43:48,927 --> 00:43:51,129
- Mm-hm.
- Just like the others.

745
00:43:51,229 --> 00:43:52,964
Only he's...

746
00:43:53,098 --> 00:43:56,534
he's stubborn as, oh,
all get out.

747
00:43:57,936 --> 00:44:00,271
Get up! Show him!

748
00:44:02,974 --> 00:44:04,710
He, uh...

749
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:07,545
He passed one day before.

750
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,314
Well, but you knew him!

751
00:44:09,447 --> 00:44:12,718
He was never late!
He was always early. Always!

752
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:18,056
Isn't that right, Eddie, baby?

753
00:44:36,975 --> 00:44:39,077
I'm gonna need the coroner
at the Shaw house.

754
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:41,146
Yeah. Listen, we got a...

755
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:45,016
<i>Sheriff?
Sheriff, are you there?</i>

756
00:44:45,784 --> 00:44:47,418
- Coop?
- <i>Sheriff?</i>

757
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,358
Cooper?

758
00:45:03,134 --> 00:45:08,138
They just keep growing back!

759
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:13,711
Mom!

760
00:45:13,845 --> 00:45:15,346
I need backup at Dittman's farm.

761
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:18,383
Stop! Everything's okay!
It's gonna be okay.

762
00:45:18,516 --> 00:45:21,819
No-no-no! Don't go near her!

763
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:23,554
Holy shit!

764
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:37,668
Get off of her!

765
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:40,906
Pudding... Ho!

766
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:52,050
Em! Move! No!

767
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,222
No!

768
00:46:01,392 --> 00:46:03,061
Em! Em! Em!

769
00:46:03,161 --> 00:46:05,163
- Help me.
- No, no!

770
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:19,376
Shit!

771
00:46:57,082 --> 00:46:58,816
Don't tell Dad.
