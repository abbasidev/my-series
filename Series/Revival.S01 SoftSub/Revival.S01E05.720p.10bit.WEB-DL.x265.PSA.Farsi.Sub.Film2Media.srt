00:00:04,754 --> 00:00:06,296
<i>Previously on Revival.</i>

2
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:08,632
Who's ready for a holy war?

3
00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:10,342
You have authority to
smoke out every reviver.

4
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:12,344
Tag them and track them.

5
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:13,595
It works during Shark
Week, and it'll work here.

6
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:18,100
She used to be a person.
Now she's a reviver.

7
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,352
I'm a reviver, Wayne,
so maybe we can keep

8
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:22,021
my registry off the books?

9
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,314
Stop dodging me.
I want answers.

10
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:25,399
That's not mine.

11
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,443
Gentleman needed to replace
his wife's wedding ring.

12
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:29,570
That asshole lied to me.
I'm done playing it safe.

13
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,864
You with me or not?
I don't need you.

14
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:34,158
He was in my house. That's
beyond crossing the line.

15
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:36,618
How many drug-related
offenses do we have?

16
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:39,580
You shake up the can, you'll
have to deal with fizz.

17
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,623
<i>You still play poker with
that piece of shit Irish cop?</i>

18
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:43,792
<i>I need to get</i> back
over the border.

19
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:45,669
-I know what you did!
-I took you

20
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,255
from the bridge, but
I didn't kill you.

21
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:50,841
Help! Somebody help!

22
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:52,926
Speed up!

23
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,165
Oh, Dana.

24
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:28,213
Somebody help!

25
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:32,549
-What do we know? Anything?
-Dana fired two shots at... Hey!

26
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:41,475
Uh, Dana?

27
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,484
Cypress family?

28
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,945
There has been significant
internal bleeding.

29
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,697
Thankfully, the bullet seems

30
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:57,449
to have missed any
of the major organs.

31
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,285
If she makes it through
surgery, we'll keep her sedated

32
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,954
for 24 hours to monitor.

33
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,623
When can we see her?

34
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,418
Could be a few more hours.

35
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,255
Yeah.

36
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,635
I got to go work on
this case. You, uh...

37
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,388
You call me when
she gets out, yeah?

38
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,973
Wait. Dad!

39
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,934
Sorry. I can't.

40
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,020
Please. Please.

41
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:29,356
Okay. What happened?
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

42
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:32,485
Um, um.

43
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,571
Please,

44
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,240
she wasn't here.

45
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:40,243
Please. She wasn't here.

46
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:47,292
Please.

47
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:59,262
Okay. Okay. Okay.

48
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:19,031
Just keep, uh, just
keep me posted.

49
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,867
So I understand there are
no discernible footprints

50
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,827
on the path. The two bullets

51
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,788
that went through our
victims are still missing.

52
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:28,582
The nine-mil shells you found
are both from Dana's weapon.

53
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,502
But that's it. Huh?
What's the working theory?

54
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:33,712
Listen, sir, I'm not sure

55
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,882
I'm supposed to be talking
to you about this. Okay?

56
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:41,553
Brent, I'm the sheriff. All
right? And it's my daughter.

57
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,681
I know. And I know
you Cypresses like to

58
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:46,141
bend the rules some.

59
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:48,352
My daughters are
my life. Okay?

60
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,937
And if you think

61
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,189
that for one second

62
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,350
you're going to keep me out
of the loop on any of this,

63
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,487
you better wake up and give
your head a shake, son.

64
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,572
Yeah.

65
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:03,367
Uh, okay, well...

66
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:05,286
Well, it's hard to say.

67
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,915
It could have been multiple
shooters, but, uh...

68
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:12,919
But what?

69
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,506
Well, the most likely scenario
is that Dana drew her gun.

70
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,759
They tussled for it, and
both of them got shot.

71
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,636
I'm sorry, but that's where all

72
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,638
the current evidence
is pointing to.

73
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,432
So, keep looking.

74
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,100
Find me some physical evidence.

75
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,978
All right? Expand
the search perimeter.

76
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:33,356
Get something that backs
that up because I think

77
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,066
that someone else was
here doing the shooting.

78
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,943
-Oh.
-Any crackpot theories

79
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,987
on why she was here
in the first place?

80
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,489
Uh, no. We're still piecing
that together. Yeah.

81
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,075
I'm gonna talk to our
witness. Ask if...

82
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,744
The doc? I'll go with you.

83
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,496
Wayne, listen,

84
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,623
I will keep you in the
loop as much as I can,

85
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,751
but we got to at least try to
keep appearances here, you know?

86
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,465
Yeah.

87
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,357
Do you own a gun?

88
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:20,778
Uh, no. Why? Why
would you ask?

89
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,571
You're our only
conscious witness,

90
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,948
and our two victims have
gunshot wounds, so...

91
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:29,996
Um, because I was, uh, I
was there on a date, sir.

92
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,748
Hm.

93
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,125
She was investigating
something, then, was she?

94
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,002
I, I don't know.

95
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:40,464
Um, she got a text from someone

96
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:43,467
and that redirected us
there, to the woods.

97
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,678
Oh. What did that text say?

98
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,223
I don't know.

99
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:51,100
I didn't think it was
any of my business.

100
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:55,854
So, you charged into the woods
trying to be the hero, huh?

101
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,524
<i>What did you see when you got</i>
in those woods, Dr. Ramin?

102
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:03,696
And, um, I saw...
There was a man, um...

103
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,948
-Mr. Weimar.
-Weimar?

104
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:09,452
Weimar, yeah. Did
Dana say anything

105
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,038
when you got there,
when you saw her?

106
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:14,289
Did she say anything?
Uh, no, sir.

107
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,792
Dana's a pretty chatty
person, you know.

108
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,585
Even in a bind, so...

109
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,212
No, sir.

110
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,922
You didn't see any
suspects running away

111
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:24,174
or anything suspicious?

112
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,218
-Nope. It would...
-No.

113
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:30,013
-It was me, Dana and Mr...
-Mr. Weimar.

114
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:33,977
Mr. Weimer. And he, uh,
yeah. There was no one else.

115
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:44,487
Hey. Dana's out of surgery.

116
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,489
Okay, um,

117
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,074
station at the door. Yeah?
I want to know exactly

118
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,701
who's coming and going.
-Okay.

119
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:52,911
Okay, Dr. Ramin,

120
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,748
let's go over this one
more time, shall we?

121
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,958
Um, okay.

122
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,772
Hey, mind if I,
uh, if I come in?

123
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,611
Coop, can you go sit with Fitzy?

124
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:27,530
I want to speak to
Ibrahim for a sec.

125
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,616
<i>Dr. Sheppard, line one.</i>

126
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,035
Hey, buddy.

127
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:43,755
Uh...

128
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,633
This is a lot.

129
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,138
What did you say in there?

130
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,642
Just what I saw,
okay. I didn't...

131
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:57,977
Except for you.

132
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,647
I know, uh,

133
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,815
I know Dana'd do
anything for you,

134
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,651
but I don't know you,

135
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:07,027
okay, and a lot of this
isn't making sense,

136
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,987
so I just need you to, uh,

137
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:12,283
just-just tell me what
happened out there.

138
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,828
I don't know.

139
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,330
Okay, then how...

140
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,415
how did you all end up
in the woods together?

141
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,583
Uh, was that you? Was
that you who texted her?

142
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:24,336
No, no. I was there
confronting Aaron

143
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,005
and Dana just showed up.

144
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:31,177
Okay, then who
shot her? Em, huh?

145
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,805
Was it that Aaron guy?
Did he set this all up?

146
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:37,224
No, no, he couldn't
have. Look, the truth is

147
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:40,102
is that Aaron and I have
a bit of a history, okay?

148
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:42,771
So I was there confronting
him, but when I got there,

149
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,190
he was already scared of
something, or someone,

150
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,859
and told me to leave,
but before I could,

151
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,861
his body...

152
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,779
His body just jerked
forward and he fell into me

153
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,322
and he was dead just like that.

154
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:58,912
Someone shot him and
then Dana showed up

155
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,789
and before I could warn her,

156
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,834
Someone shot her, too.
And then I took her gun

157
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:05,712
and I shot back and I hit him.

158
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:08,048
But it wasn't enough
and he got away.

159
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:15,804
I am so sorry that you have

160
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,057
been brought into all of
this and have to lie for me.

161
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,934
I'm not... I'm not
lying for you. I'm...

162
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,149
I'm lying for Dana.

163
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,320
But I'm a really bad liar,
okay? I suck at it and I just...

164
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:34,782
I'm so bad, and,
um, I don't know.

165
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:37,368
If the police keep going and
they keep asking questions,

166
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:39,161
I might crack, okay?

167
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,331
I'm sorry, I might...
I'm not good...

168
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm not good at any of this.

169
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,211
I will figure this out.

170
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:48,879
<i>Okay?</i>

171
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,097
Trust me.

172
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,186
I'm a Cypress.

173
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,730
Shit.

174
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,109
It's still in me.

175
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,738
But who would kill

176
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,824
Mr. Weimar and shoot
Dana? I'm worried.

177
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:19,159
It's okay, sweetheart.
We're working the case now.

178
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,786
We'll have answers soon.

179
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,997
Rogers, I need the
coroner's intake exam

180
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:24,999
the minute it lands on
your desk. Thank you.

181
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,375
You do know I'm capable
of more than paperwork?

182
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,377
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah. Please.

183
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,254
Dad, I wanna help.

184
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:32,589
Look, you should know.

185
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,925
There is a working theory that
Dana is the one at fault here.

186
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:37,052
How? She was shot, too.

187
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,013
Sorry, boss. Lester
wants a word.

188
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:41,223
Not now, Lester!

189
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:42,851
Go on.

190
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:47,104
But what does this
mean for Dana?

191
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:49,690
You're still investigating
who shot her, right?

192
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,483
Like, Dad, what's going on?
-Martha, please!

193
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,028
I can't right now.
I have to focus.

194
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:00,200
All right, look:

195
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,328
Now you gotta keep
this to yourself, okay?

196
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:05,956
The evidence presently points
towards Dana as the one

197
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:09,501
who did the shooting and that
ain't good for Dana, okay?

198
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,004
But I know there has
gotta be more to this

199
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,214
and I'm going to keep digging
until I find out what it is.

200
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:17,301
How would you go about proving
that another gun was involved?

201
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:20,304
Both the victims were shot
through and through, okay?

202
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,222
So that means that those bullets

203
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,975
could've gone 600 or so
feet in any direction.

204
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:27,227
How would you go about
finding a missing bullet?

205
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,396
We've already swept
the area for hours.

206
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,398
But if you find this bullet
you could break the case.

207
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,400
Find the bullet and the shooter.
-Yes, and we'll sweep again.

208
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,319
-Sheriff.
-Once more tomorrow afternoon.

209
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,488
Get out! Now! I said no!

210
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:39,948
-Okay, okay.
-He escaped! Sorry, boss.

211
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:43,994
Is this, like, a 1:00
pm situation, or a 4ish?

212
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:46,372
You stay out of it, okay?

213
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:48,248
Now that's it. No
more questions.

214
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:51,169
I have got a killer
to find so, please,

215
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,337
close the door on your way out.

216
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,006
Thank you. I love you.

217
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,257
And tell Lester I'm sorry.

218
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,093
Okay.

219
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,429
Reviver subject Myles Miller,

220
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,516
male, 43 years old on loan from

221
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:07,935
the Mountain Bay
County Penitentiary.

222
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,271
Please strip, Mr. Miller.

223
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,193
They gotta be
watching while I...?

224
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,863
Yes, ma'am.

225
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,950
You just be sure
to tell the judge

226
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:24,452
I been on my best behaviour.

227
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,122
Will do.

228
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:34,212
Careful with those.

229
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:38,216
Ow!

230
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:47,392
Ah.

231
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,228
Oh.

232
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,236
-We're good.
-Monsters.

233
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,327
You know how embarrassing
that was for her?

234
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,245
To have that mark in her ID?

235
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:11,999
Notice on our door?

236
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,585
That bother her or you?

237
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:16,337
Why do you gotta
be such an asshole?

238
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:19,340
I'm doing this for
your own good, Ken.

239
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:20,632
She's a reviver.

240
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,011
A good one! And my wife!

241
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:27,057
Look, I get it, okay?

242
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,975
But what happens when Diane
or one of the other ones

243
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,518
snaps again?

244
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,313
I have to look at
the big picture.

245
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:36,107
You think she'd do that?

246
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,860
This is the woman that
brought you casseroles,

247
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:41,862
helped around the house
when Patty was sick.

248
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:43,364
Who helped watch little Martha.

249
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:45,867
The old Diane? Of course not.

250
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,535
But she's gone, Ken.

251
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,454
And we don't really
know for certain yet

252
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,247
who's taken her place.

253
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,917
I know you better
than anybody, Kenny.

254
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:56,085
And I know if you
weren't so close to this

255
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:57,628
you'd see it the way I do.

256
00:13:57,629 --> 00:13:59,547
You know what I see?

257
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:02,174
A man who thinks he
gets a free asshole pass

258
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,926
because his wife died.

259
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:05,469
When the truth is
you and I both know

260
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,388
you were an asshole
long before that.

261
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,893
Now, I told you before,

262
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:15,145
I'm not going down this
road with you again. Okay?

263
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:16,814
So, you better tread softly

264
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:18,732
when you talk about
Patty and my family.

265
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:21,486
Diane is my family. Give
me the same damn courtesy.

266
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,447
Now you of all people
should understand

267
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:27,992
I am the sheriff. Okay?

268
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:29,493
I have to think about everybody.

269
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,370
I have an obligation
to this town.

270
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,372
I can't let you have it one way

271
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,749
and everybody else
have it another!

272
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,070
But what if it was somebody
that you loved was a reviver?

273
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:40,379
Would you still do it?

274
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,714
Yes.

275
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:44,091
You're a nasty piece of work,

276
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:47,302
considering that you got one
daughter in anger management

277
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,014
and another suspected of murder.

278
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:51,682
It's clear that the
last piece of goodness

279
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:54,352
in the Cypress family
died with Patty.

280
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,938
Say it again.

281
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:59,065
I dare you.

282
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,110
Go ahead, Wayne,
give it your shot.

283
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:06,947
You know, you might
have the governor

284
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:08,449
and a few good folks
in this town fooled,

285
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,285
but I know the real you

286
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:12,953
and I'm making it my
mission to make sure that

287
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:14,456
you don't get re-elected.

288
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,916
You'll never wear a badge again.

289
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:25,257
Mr. Mayor.

290
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:27,343
Don't say a goddamn word

291
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:29,387
unless you've found
Dana's shooter.

292
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:32,473
That's what I thought. Now
I gotta get back to work.

293
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:34,808
You busy yourself somewhere else

294
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:36,310
doing something else, okay?

295
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,106
You got it, Chief.

296
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:56,372
<i>Hey, you can push
me just so far.</i>

297
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:01,168
Are you okay?

298
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:03,045
-Not really.
-Hm.

299
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:10,427
Hm.

300
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:12,348
Well, whatever you gotta
say, you could say it.

301
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:15,474
It's about Aaron.

302
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,268
Aw, Dude...

303
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:20,647
Look, I get that
professor shit can be hot.

304
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:25,567
I do, but you can really
do so much better, Em.

305
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:29,446
He's dead.

306
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:35,120
Shit.

307
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,579
Shit, well, I guess
don't kick him now.

308
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,290
-No.
-What the hell even happened?

309
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,292
I don't know. He was
dead when we found him.

310
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:45,295
You found him dead?

311
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,506
Wait, what do you mean by we?

312
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,092
Me and Dana.

313
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:52,219
What the hell is
wrong with you two?

314
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,597
Look, I need your help because
whoever shot Aaron shot Dana.

315
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:57,683
She got shot too?

316
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:00,644
I need you. Please.
Look, I don't know

317
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:03,732
who else I can ask
or who I can trust.

318
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:08,153
I don't know, dude.

319
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:11,155
This is so whack.

320
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:13,699
Come on. Just do it already.

321
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:19,413
Yep, just gonna...

322
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:21,081
Okay.

323
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,252
I can't look.

324
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:26,879
I can't look!

325
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:31,509
Ugh, the blood. The blood!

326
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:35,262
Oh my... God.

327
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:38,265
It is not that bad!

328
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:39,892
Okay.

329
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:41,769
No. What? No. What
the... We are not making

330
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:45,606
a Caesar salad here! Look,
I can't get the right angle,

331
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:47,316
so I need you take off
those gloves and just...

332
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:49,151
-Ai-ya-yai.
-Pull it out with your fingers.

333
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:51,028
Come on! Dude, it's
healing. Let's go!

334
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:52,571
Oh my God, oh my God,
oh my God, oh my God,

335
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,114
oh my God, oh my God, oh my...

336
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:59,828
Ooh!

337
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:02,248
I got it!

338
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:15,553
And now for the hard part.

339
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,390
The hard part?!

340
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,230
This is me.

341
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:28,483
I might not know
why it happened.

342
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:32,404
But I'm no longer
sad that it did.

343
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:36,324
Thank you, Wanda.

344
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,327
Anyone else have anything
they'd like to share?

345
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:42,371
Go ahead, Damon.

346
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,377
I used to think God had a plan.

347
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:52,924
And then I died. And
now I'm alive and, uh...

348
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:56,510
I guess it feels like
something's missing,

349
00:18:56,511 --> 00:19:00,389
like there's a real emptiness
inside me. It's lonely.

350
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:03,434
And if God does have a
plan, is this really it?

351
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:07,521
Maybe this is a second
chance. Your opportunity

352
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:09,648
to live with intention.

353
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:16,071
Ah, what have we here? Nella.

354
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,241
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

355
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:22,746
God-fearing woman helping
some legion of demons?

356
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:26,290
Have you no soul?
-Get out of here, Blaine.

357
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,083
Leave these poor people alone!

358
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:30,211
People?

359
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:35,049
People bleed and then
die. These are not people.

360
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:38,010
You're but another
consort of demons

361
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:41,680
standing amongst the damned
as they're just walking

362
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,058
on this path. It's wicked.

363
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:46,853
Now you should be
thanking your God

364
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:51,899
that we are all here to
rescue you from what's coming.

365
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,736
She said leave!

366
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:59,366
Yeah.

367
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:04,412
Okay.

368
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:10,669
Yeah. Yeah, I know that smell.

369
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,088
It's pagan rot.

370
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:17,341
You're one of the
damned going to Hell,

371
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:19,385
so you should be taking
a good look at me because

372
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:21,513
I'm going to be
sending you back.

373
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:25,474
Hey! Don't hurt him.

374
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:31,063
Oh my God. Are you okay?

375
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:33,065
Sorry, I...

376
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:35,025
I didn't realize
my own strength.

377
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:37,821
Oh. Mm.

378
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:41,782
We're coming for you.

379
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:44,785
Starting to show their
true colours, boys.

380
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,706
Gentlemen, help him up.

381
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:54,002
Shit, you're strong!

382
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:55,754
Never mind that.

383
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,172
We're going to go over
this one more time.

384
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:59,842
-Okay.
-You're the distraction.

385
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:01,468
Me?

386
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,721
Not again.

387
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:06,515
No problem. Love
helping the ladies.

388
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:09,018
You know us.

389
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:11,938
Those lug nuts are
so hard to turn.

390
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:14,648
Yeah, if you go on
Reddit, lefty loosey,

391
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:17,026
it actually explains
it's a myth, so...

392
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:19,319
-Oh.
-You go on Reddit?

393
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,489
<i>Once you get Randy out,
that's when I go in.</i>

394
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:24,266
<i>I need to get Aaron's blood on
the bullet because, you know,</i>

395
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:26,660
DNA? So I need
to find his body.

396
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:29,038
Once I find his body,
that's when I will put

397
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,790
<i>the blood on Aaron's bullet,
so that when the police find I,</i>

398
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,710
<i>they think that the
bullet went through Aaron.</i>

399
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:37,713
And since the shooter shot
Aaron, Dana, and I all,

400
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:39,673
once they find the
bullet they find

401
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:41,092
<i>the shooter who shot Dana.</i>

402
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:53,437
What the hell?

403
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:55,397
What are you doing in here?

404
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:57,024
You should be out there.
You're the distraction!

405
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:59,444
Randy's barely got
one lug nut off.

406
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:01,529
He's a creep. I told
him I had to piss.

407
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,698
Oh, that would've
been a lot easier.

408
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:13,082
Careful!

409
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:16,795
You throw up and your DNA
is all over the place.

410
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,566
I'm at a dead end, Danes.

411
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:45,240
I need your help with this.

412
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:50,078
I want to get whoever did
this but the leads are shit.

413
00:22:52,998 --> 00:22:54,873
You know, I wish to hell
you'd have come to me

414
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,501
if you were in trouble.

415
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:06,761
Yeah, well, I'm
sure it's my fault.

416
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:10,765
Your mom always said
I was too hard on you.

417
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:15,228
I just had to be sure you
were on the right path.

418
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:27,239
You gotta come out of this.

419
00:23:44,716 --> 00:23:46,842
Oh, uh, Sheriff, Sheriff.

420
00:23:46,843 --> 00:23:50,180
I, uh, I got more information
on, uh, Mr. Weimar.

421
00:23:50,889 --> 00:23:55,059
Yeah, uh, it appears he was,
um, choked before he was shot.

422
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,394
What about the GSR results?
Are they still missing?

423
00:23:57,395 --> 00:23:59,688
Well, that was an
honest mistake, um...

424
00:23:59,689 --> 00:24:02,024
You know Randy?

425
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:04,109
Yeah, well ever since that man
woke up in his incinerator,

426
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,070
he's been a little bit
all over the place.

427
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:07,905
Do you have anything of merit

428
00:24:07,906 --> 00:24:10,033
that you want to
share with me, Deputy?

429
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:13,077
Yeah, I'll just
get into it. Uh...

430
00:24:13,078 --> 00:24:16,747
The last text that, uh, Aaron
Weimar sent before he, uh,

431
00:24:16,748 --> 00:24:19,416
before he died was to Dana.

432
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,837
Yeah, it, uh...

433
00:24:23,838 --> 00:24:26,048
"Go to the woods behind Pacer's.

434
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:28,385
I'll tell you what
really happened."

435
00:24:36,184 --> 00:24:37,851
Okay, what's taking you so long?

436
00:24:37,852 --> 00:24:39,269
You said they're coming
in the afternoon,

437
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,729
which could be any minute now.

438
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,731
I know, I know.

439
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:45,401
I just need it to be perfect.

440
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:48,779
They need to find the bullet,
but not think it was moved.

441
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,447
I'm going to have a lifetime
worth of trauma for this.

442
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:52,241
Okay, if this is
your worst trauma,

443
00:24:52,242 --> 00:24:53,951
you've lived a very
privileged life.

444
00:25:07,215 --> 00:25:08,883
What?

445
00:25:09,217 --> 00:25:11,218
I toss it I compromise
the scene, right?

446
00:25:11,219 --> 00:25:12,803
You do listen.

447
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:14,305
Hm.

448
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:21,937
Oh my God.

449
00:25:21,938 --> 00:25:24,315
My God, Dana's awake!

450
00:25:24,316 --> 00:25:26,150
-Oh my God. Shit.
-Oh, shit.

451
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,281
Testing shows no phosphate
or nitrate present

452
00:25:32,282 --> 00:25:34,158
in the water samples
from Moore Creek.

453
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,243
This rules out

454
00:25:36,244 --> 00:25:38,746
The usual cause of rapid
algae bloom formation.

455
00:25:38,747 --> 00:25:41,498
We still need to test all
known elements and pathogens,

456
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:44,001
but for now my theory remains

457
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:47,255
Moore Creek is ground
zero for Revival Day.

458
00:25:49,007 --> 00:25:51,175
Hey. Just the man I
wanted to speak to.

459
00:25:51,176 --> 00:25:53,218
Good. If it's about
what happened to Dana

460
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:54,887
'cause that's all
I want to hear.

461
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:57,264
-I already talked...
-Look...

462
00:25:57,265 --> 00:25:59,058
-...to your deputy about it.
-Maybe you missed something.

463
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:01,019
Think! All right?

464
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:03,812
Are you sure about the
direction of the gunfire?

465
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:06,106
You know, maybe you
saw a strange car,

466
00:26:06,107 --> 00:26:07,816
or heard someone else there?

467
00:26:07,817 --> 00:26:09,527
Oh...

468
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:13,781
You did see something
else, didn't you?

469
00:26:13,782 --> 00:26:15,532
What aren't you telling me?

470
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:17,093
Nothing? I just...

471
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:23,415
What the hell is...?

472
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:25,084
Hey.

473
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:26,836
Get it out!

474
00:26:28,088 --> 00:26:30,130
Get it out! Please!

475
00:26:30,131 --> 00:26:31,548
Please!

476
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:33,926
This.

477
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:35,761
Note that we increased the
dosage by five milligrams.

478
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:38,138
-Get it out! Hurry! Please!
-Let me get this out.

479
00:26:38,139 --> 00:26:40,391
I got you. I got you.

480
00:26:40,392 --> 00:26:43,977
You're okay. Okay? Okay. Okay.

481
00:26:46,815 --> 00:26:48,525
You're okay. You're okay.

482
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:51,360
Hey. What are you...
What are you doing?

483
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:53,362
We're giving him crotalase.

484
00:26:53,363 --> 00:26:55,572
You're giving him snake venom?

485
00:26:55,573 --> 00:26:58,575
No, we were testing more
extreme ranges of pathogens

486
00:26:58,576 --> 00:27:01,161
to see if we could
get the sheriff

487
00:27:01,162 --> 00:27:02,371
the answers he needs.

488
00:27:02,372 --> 00:27:04,206
And your hypothesis?

489
00:27:04,207 --> 00:27:06,292
Crotalase could
slow cell division.

490
00:27:07,127 --> 00:27:09,503
-What does that mean?
-As you can see,

491
00:27:09,504 --> 00:27:12,464
it dramatically slows down
reviver healing properties.

492
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:15,175
Yeah, but this, this,
this is inhumane.

493
00:27:15,176 --> 00:27:17,302
Wasn't the intention.

494
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:20,931
After revivers showed
unnatural strength under duress

495
00:27:20,932 --> 00:27:23,225
we decided to try this option.

496
00:27:23,226 --> 00:27:24,935
So they are dangerous?

497
00:27:24,936 --> 00:27:26,520
No. We cannot jump
to conclusions.

498
00:27:26,521 --> 00:27:29,607
Which is why we rely on science.

499
00:27:30,275 --> 00:27:33,360
Now that we know that we
can slow revivers down,

500
00:27:33,361 --> 00:27:35,238
all we have to do is just

501
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:38,449
change the dose and then
maybe we can figure out

502
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:40,367
what started this
whole revival thing

503
00:27:40,368 --> 00:27:43,537
in the first place.
Starting here.

504
00:27:43,538 --> 00:27:45,081
Here. With torture?

505
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:47,958
No, with discovery.

506
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:50,210
No! This is not
the way, Sheriff.

507
00:27:50,211 --> 00:27:52,379
You know what can happen if
this gets into the wrong hands.

508
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,591
Look, take a beat, Doc.
I won't let that happen.

509
00:27:56,301 --> 00:27:59,637
Look, good work, okay?

510
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,557
And while I want to
keep everyone safe,

511
00:28:03,308 --> 00:28:04,976
this is good intel,

512
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:07,269
but let's step back from

513
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:09,064
this direction of
inquiry for a while.

514
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:11,566
Copy?

515
00:28:12,984 --> 00:28:14,402
Copy.

516
00:28:25,872 --> 00:28:27,331
All these years trying
to get your respect

517
00:28:27,332 --> 00:28:29,166
all I had to do was get shot.

518
00:28:30,669 --> 00:28:32,336
How you feeling?

519
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:36,257
Like I got hit by a Mack truck.

520
00:28:37,967 --> 00:28:39,302
Lose a fight with a razor?

521
00:28:39,969 --> 00:28:42,263
Shut up. I like it.

522
00:28:43,098 --> 00:28:44,932
How long was I out?

523
00:28:44,933 --> 00:28:47,142
Twenty-four hours, give or take.

524
00:28:47,143 --> 00:28:50,188
Oh, God. Poor Coop. He
must have been so worried.

525
00:28:51,398 --> 00:28:53,024
We all were.

526
00:28:53,525 --> 00:28:56,194
He's okay, though.
He's with Nella.

527
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:00,072
-Did they find who did this?
-Not yet.

528
00:29:00,073 --> 00:29:02,241
But they have Fitzy stationed
at the door just to be careful,

529
00:29:02,242 --> 00:29:06,496
but, Dana, what were
you doing out there?

530
00:29:07,664 --> 00:29:09,374
I could ask you the same thing.

531
00:29:11,376 --> 00:29:13,211
You were right about Aaron.

532
00:29:14,087 --> 00:29:15,713
He was on the bridge that night

533
00:29:15,714 --> 00:29:18,298
and somehow his ring
was inside of me.

534
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:21,218
He was lying, so I really
thought that he killed me

535
00:29:21,219 --> 00:29:23,138
even though he swears
that he didn't.

536
00:29:23,972 --> 00:29:25,223
Em...

537
00:29:26,516 --> 00:29:28,267
did you kill Aaron?

538
00:29:28,268 --> 00:29:30,395
God, really...

539
00:29:32,147 --> 00:29:33,565
wanted to.

540
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:35,984
And I almost did.

541
00:29:36,776 --> 00:29:38,403
But I couldn't.

542
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:41,322
And I didn't.
-Good.

543
00:29:41,323 --> 00:29:43,741
But whoever shot him,

544
00:29:43,742 --> 00:29:46,118
shot you. I even
fired back at them.

545
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,870
Do you... Do you think that
they were there for Aaron

546
00:29:47,871 --> 00:29:49,580
and maybe you just got
caught in the middle?

547
00:29:49,581 --> 00:29:51,249
I don't know but
I'll figure it out.

548
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,508
What if...

549
00:30:01,176 --> 00:30:03,219
I was the reason
that you nearly died?

550
00:30:07,515 --> 00:30:09,184
Come here.

551
00:30:20,195 --> 00:30:21,612
I just don't know
what I would have done

552
00:30:21,613 --> 00:30:23,281
if I lost you, too.

553
00:30:30,413 --> 00:30:32,581
I'm not going anywhere, okay?

554
00:30:32,582 --> 00:30:34,042
Okay.

555
00:30:34,876 --> 00:30:36,461
We'll figure this out.

556
00:30:37,128 --> 00:30:39,005
Together.

557
00:30:39,798 --> 00:30:42,717
I think it's time I
start taking care of you.

558
00:30:47,305 --> 00:30:48,765
How are you going to do that?

559
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,227
I have my ways.

560
00:31:03,488 --> 00:31:05,448
Consistent with the
injuries of the victim.

561
00:31:06,199 --> 00:31:08,200
Who we looking at now?

562
00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:10,536
We're working on it.

563
00:31:10,537 --> 00:31:12,872
I'll, uh, I'll let you know
as soon as we know something.

564
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,792
JP.

565
00:31:16,584 --> 00:31:18,919
Have you talked to Lester yet?
-What is it about this time?

566
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,672
Well, I think you're going
to want to hear this.

567
00:31:21,673 --> 00:31:24,216
Apparently he saw
someone suspicious

568
00:31:24,217 --> 00:31:26,593
the night of the shooting.

569
00:31:26,594 --> 00:31:28,345
<i>Goddamn people always
traipsing through</i>

570
00:31:28,346 --> 00:31:31,433
my woods. I keep telling
you but you don't listen.

571
00:31:31,933 --> 00:31:33,934
So then the other night,

572
00:31:33,935 --> 00:31:35,811
I'm out walking my
dog, Chuck, like usual,

573
00:31:35,812 --> 00:31:37,604
and I hear two shots.

574
00:31:39,274 --> 00:31:40,734
Then another two.

575
00:31:41,776 --> 00:31:43,319
That's four in total.

576
00:31:43,945 --> 00:31:45,779
Then this man, all in black

577
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:48,199
with one of those
black ski masks,

578
00:31:48,616 --> 00:31:50,659
which they should not
be selling on account of

579
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,703
they're the mask of choice
for said perpetrators.

580
00:31:52,704 --> 00:31:54,621
-Lester, get to the point!
-All right, Sheriff.

581
00:31:54,622 --> 00:31:56,540
Okay. Yes, sir.

582
00:31:56,541 --> 00:31:58,500
So, this black-ski-masking fella

583
00:31:58,501 --> 00:32:00,669
goes tearing across the
east side of my property

584
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:03,422
like a bat out of hell right
toward Stone Bridge Road.

585
00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:06,342
He was wearing those pants
with all them pockets,

586
00:32:06,343 --> 00:32:10,971
I think tactical boots and one
of those small flashlights.

587
00:32:10,972 --> 00:32:14,309
I believe it was a Fenix TK16.

588
00:32:14,809 --> 00:32:18,312
Maybe a Klarus XT2CR.

589
00:32:18,313 --> 00:32:19,855
Like this?

590
00:32:19,856 --> 00:32:21,941
Well, yeah. Exactly.

591
00:32:22,692 --> 00:32:24,485
Of course, those
3100 lumen ones,

592
00:32:24,486 --> 00:32:26,737
they have about
400 yards of throw.

593
00:32:26,738 --> 00:32:30,866
Most people cheap out
with the 250 lumen ones.

594
00:32:30,867 --> 00:32:32,535
Brent!

595
00:32:34,245 --> 00:32:35,913
Hey, Lewis, come over here.

596
00:32:35,914 --> 00:32:37,540
Lester saw the shooter.

597
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:39,459
It's a cop.

598
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:43,796
-Uh, what?
-Yeah.

599
00:32:43,797 --> 00:32:46,590
I want you to run ballistics
on everybody's firearm,

600
00:32:46,591 --> 00:32:48,551
including yours.

601
00:32:49,386 --> 00:32:52,305
Okay, yeah. Um, well, I'm
gonna need yours, too.

602
00:32:54,265 --> 00:32:56,433
All right.

603
00:32:56,434 --> 00:32:58,936
Now, I want you to check
their lockers, okay?

604
00:32:58,937 --> 00:33:02,356
Their vehicles. Work and
private. Evidence logs.

605
00:33:02,357 --> 00:33:04,441
We're gonna need a clean
chain of evidence here

606
00:33:04,442 --> 00:33:06,735
without you, so...
-That's why I'm telling you

607
00:33:06,736 --> 00:33:09,780
to do it because I'm not
doing it myself! Okay?

608
00:33:09,781 --> 00:33:11,573
Yep. All right. I get it.

609
00:33:11,574 --> 00:33:13,659
Sheriff, please. Please.

610
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:16,787
Good. Yep. Um, Fitzy,
Rogers? Let's go, all right?

611
00:33:16,788 --> 00:33:19,332
I got more.

612
00:33:23,795 --> 00:33:26,714
<i>Yes, we all know you
have a moral objection,</i>

613
00:33:26,715 --> 00:33:29,049
<i>but that doesn't mean you can
refuse an official request.</i>

614
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:31,093
Yes, I can. That's why
they call it "request."

615
00:33:31,094 --> 00:33:33,595
Request denied.
<i>-Since it was the sheriff</i>

616
00:33:33,596 --> 00:33:35,639
<i>who asked for the
CDC's assistance</i>

617
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,392
<i>and he isn't here
to say otherwise,</i>

618
00:33:38,393 --> 00:33:40,436
<i>I am inclined to let Dr. Morel</i>

619
00:33:40,437 --> 00:33:42,688
<i>continue with her
line of investigation.</i>

620
00:33:42,689 --> 00:33:44,481
As head of the Wausau
project, I firmly disagree.

621
00:33:44,482 --> 00:33:45,983
-Ibrahim, let it go.
-You heard the sheriff:

622
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,443
He doesn't want
your kind of help.

623
00:33:47,444 --> 00:33:49,611
<i> If we're going to talk,</i>

624
00:33:49,612 --> 00:33:51,739
<i>let's make sure that the
whole class can hear.</i>

625
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,991
-Sorry.
<i>-Now, Dr. Ramin,</i>

626
00:33:53,992 --> 00:33:56,036
<i>I'm not sure how things
work with the CDC,</i>

627
00:33:56,703 --> 00:33:59,413
<i>but in Wausau, you
are an interloper</i>

628
00:33:59,414 --> 00:34:01,040
<i>and obstructing the
sheriff's mandate</i>

629
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:04,335
<i>and defying my order
is unacceptable.</i>

630
00:34:04,336 --> 00:34:06,754
Well, then, we
are at an impasse.

631
00:34:06,755 --> 00:34:09,423
<i>No, we're at a
leadership change.</i>

632
00:34:09,424 --> 00:34:11,842
Wait. If you just
talked to the sheriff,

633
00:34:11,843 --> 00:34:13,594
if you just talk
to him, you could

634
00:34:13,595 --> 00:34:15,929
just figure this whole thing...
<i>-No need.</i>

635
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:18,015
<i>You can surrender all your
samples and data to Dr. Morel.</i>

636
00:34:18,016 --> 00:34:20,809
<i>She heads the Wausau
project as of today.</i>

637
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:22,562
<i>You answer to her now.</i>

638
00:34:23,396 --> 00:34:25,105
-What?
-Thank you, ma'am.

639
00:34:25,106 --> 00:34:26,900
I appreciate your support.

640
00:34:27,484 --> 00:34:28,943
<i> Don't let me down.</i>

641
00:34:35,617 --> 00:34:37,076
I'll give you a second.

642
00:34:48,546 --> 00:34:50,006
Hm.

643
00:35:50,984 --> 00:35:52,569
This brave soul

644
00:35:53,695 --> 00:35:55,905
proved himself
worthy to our cause.

645
00:35:58,408 --> 00:36:00,951
His sacrifice deserves
a great reward.

646
00:36:00,952 --> 00:36:02,953
Our rock, our fortress,

647
00:36:02,954 --> 00:36:05,706
grant us everlasting light!

648
00:36:05,707 --> 00:36:07,458
Our rock, our fortress,

649
00:36:07,459 --> 00:36:10,044
grant us everlasting light.

650
00:36:10,045 --> 00:36:14,715
Our rock, our fortress,
grant us everlasting light.

651
00:36:14,716 --> 00:36:16,634
It's time for you
to get branded.

652
00:36:17,135 --> 00:36:18,844
Become one of the flock.

653
00:36:21,473 --> 00:36:24,601
Go in. Give your hand
to the guiding light.

654
00:36:25,852 --> 00:36:27,896
May it burn away your sins

655
00:36:28,772 --> 00:36:30,190
and become one of us.

656
00:37:05,725 --> 00:37:07,518
Our rock, our fortress...

657
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:19,989
Behold!

658
00:37:20,865 --> 00:37:22,658
His ascension.

659
00:37:29,082 --> 00:37:33,461
Our rock, our fortress,
grant us everlasting light

660
00:37:33,962 --> 00:37:35,839
Our rock, our fortress...

661
00:37:50,854 --> 00:37:52,313
It's a colouring book.

662
00:37:53,398 --> 00:37:55,400
I'm, like, a grown-ass woman.

663
00:37:56,234 --> 00:37:59,445
Uh, yeah. The, the, I
thought the candy could

664
00:37:59,446 --> 00:38:01,447
be for you and then...
-Oh.

665
00:38:01,448 --> 00:38:02,781
The colouring book and
everything else, uh,

666
00:38:02,782 --> 00:38:04,158
maybe for Cooper.

667
00:38:07,412 --> 00:38:09,413
It's really nice. Thank you.

668
00:38:09,414 --> 00:38:11,124
Yeah.

669
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:14,961
Glad you're here.

670
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,049
Yeah. Yeah, me, too.

671
00:38:20,467 --> 00:38:22,301
Thank you.

672
00:38:22,302 --> 00:38:25,138
Listen, I get that
I asked you to lie.

673
00:38:26,389 --> 00:38:28,683
And I know that
that's a lot. I know.

674
00:38:29,934 --> 00:38:32,436
And you didn't question
it and that says a lot.

675
00:38:32,437 --> 00:38:34,147
But I want you to know that...

676
00:38:35,523 --> 00:38:37,025
I can't tell you

677
00:38:38,109 --> 00:38:40,027
what's going on,
but I promise you

678
00:38:40,028 --> 00:38:42,030
it was for a good reason

679
00:38:42,238 --> 00:38:44,448
and I'm really sorry for
putting you through that.

680
00:38:44,449 --> 00:38:47,202
Thank you for
protecting my sister.

681
00:38:48,203 --> 00:38:52,081
Yeah. It's... It's okay.

682
00:38:54,793 --> 00:38:57,378
Well, I mean, this part of
my day, believe it or not,

683
00:38:57,379 --> 00:39:00,798
turned out to be just
okay in a good way.

684
00:39:00,799 --> 00:39:02,591
-Really?
-Yeah, yeah.

685
00:39:02,592 --> 00:39:04,385
No, I just said that and
yeah, it did, it did.

686
00:39:06,388 --> 00:39:08,639
Well, I've only been
out for 24 hours.

687
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,891
Fill me in. What happened?
-No, I'm not going to do it.

688
00:39:10,892 --> 00:39:12,851
Dump my problems on... No.
-Oh, come on!

689
00:39:12,852 --> 00:39:14,228
-You're in a hospital bed.
-Honestly, this is

690
00:39:14,229 --> 00:39:16,355
the last time you'll get
my undivided attention.

691
00:39:16,356 --> 00:39:18,148
I promise you that. So
just shoot your shot.

692
00:39:18,149 --> 00:39:19,818
Oh!

693
00:39:20,318 --> 00:39:21,777
Pick a different
choice of words.

694
00:39:21,778 --> 00:39:23,363
Anything else.

695
00:39:24,072 --> 00:39:27,826
Oh, well, uh, I...

696
00:39:28,326 --> 00:39:30,870
I may not have a
job for much longer.

697
00:39:31,538 --> 00:39:33,997
What? Are you leaving Wausau?

698
00:39:33,998 --> 00:39:35,959
Not if I can help it. Um...

699
00:39:36,376 --> 00:39:37,961
Why? Would you be...

700
