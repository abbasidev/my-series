00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:31,139
I've known a few
generals in my time.

They were smart, respected,

338
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,478

339
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:40,190
This general can offer you
the same deal as the mayor,

340

us bring her in safely.

[round chambered into

You'd be doing me a favour.

348
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,310
Martha never told
me what she was

349
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,772
and I had no idea
until I saw that video.

350
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:23,775
So I don't know where she is,

351

or what she's capable of,

352
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,614

me enough to tell me.

Yeah, well, technically,
he figured it out.

I didn't tell you.

Why did Brent shoot
Aaron and then me?

473
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,003
Because one of us
knew who killed Em

474

and the other was
close to finding out.

475
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:39,674
So, then, the next
obvious question is,

476
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,760
then, did Brent kill Martha?

477
00:21:41,843 --> 00:21:44,137
Or was he a hired gun?

478
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:48,016

was working with the person

was working for them.

you something, Dana.

00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:04,786
You know what? You
should take a rest here.

653
00:29:04,869 --> 00:29:07,623
Come on. Come. This is perfect.

654
00:29:07,706 --> 00:29:09,625
Here, you sit, you sit.
-[Em groans]

655
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:10,876
Okay, just take it easy, okay?

656
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:12,627
[Em sighs, sniffles]

657
00:29:14,546 --> 00:29:16,172
Earlier, um,

658
00:29:16,673 --> 00:29:18,550
when you were sick
you were having these

659
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,802
vivid dreams.

660
00:29:20,885 --> 00:29:22,554
Flashes.

661
00:29:24,055 --> 00:29:25,807
To the warehouse and what I did.

662
00:29:27,642 --> 00:29:28,893
To the Checks?

663
00:29:31,062 --> 00:29:32,731
And what I did to me.

664
00:29:34,316 --> 00:29:35,817
There was, like,

665
00:29:36,401 --> 00:29:39,571
electricity running
through my body,

666
00:29:39,654 --> 00:29:42,574
glacier water through
my veins. Me...

667
00:29:43,992 --> 00:29:45,577
but not me.

668
00:29:46,661 --> 00:29:48,246
Em, it's, uh,

669
00:29:48,329 --> 00:29:50,415
I've tested many, many,
many revivers, Em.

670
00:29:50,874 --> 00:29:52,751
Biologically, they are
all still themselves.

671
00:29:52,834 --> 00:29:54,753
Their cells just act
a little different,

672
00:29:54,836 --> 00:29:56,087
that's all.

673
00:29:56,838 --> 00:29:58,506
This is more than that.

674
00:30:02,927 --> 00:30:06,681
I don't know who I am anymore.

675
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:12,771
I used to be timid
and fragile and I...

676
00:30:14,022 --> 00:30:16,525
didn't necessarily like
myself all the time,

677
00:30:16,608 --> 00:30:20,362
but I knew who I was
and now I have...

678
00:30:20,445 --> 00:30:22,030
[scoffs]

679
00:30:22,113 --> 00:30:24,574
...no idea. I have...

680
00:30:25,033 --> 00:30:26,535
no concept of the
world around me

681
00:30:26,618 --> 00:30:28,870
and what happened
last night? You...

682
00:30:31,081 --> 00:30:35,586
You said that Jordan combined
with some glowing creature

683
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:38,922
and then vanished and what
if that happens to me?

684
00:30:39,005 --> 00:30:40,549
What does that even...

685
00:30:40,632 --> 00:30:42,634
What does that even mean?
-Hey, hey.

686
00:30:43,093 --> 00:30:46,554
Hey, you're living an
unprecedented life, Em.

687
00:30:46,888 --> 00:30:49,141
It's okay.

688
00:30:49,224 --> 00:30:51,768
It's bound to do your head in
from time to time. Okay? Hey.

689
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:52,936
-[Em sniffles]
-(whisper) Okay.

690
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:54,563
When I feel unsettled,

691
00:30:54,646 --> 00:30:56,648
I try to focus on
what I know for sure.

692
00:30:58,692 --> 00:31:00,652
Yeah, that must be
the scientist in you.

693
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:03,571
-[chuckles]
-Yeah, it must be.

694
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:07,909
But what I saw last night,
I observed, was this:

695
00:31:08,618 --> 00:31:12,497
Jordan, she didn't look
scared of the creature.

696
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:16,084
She, she didn't cry
out. She didn't falter.

697
00:31:17,168 --> 00:31:20,422
In the face of this
large, haunting,

698
00:31:20,505 --> 00:31:24,176
alien-like creature, being,
whatever you want to call it,

699
00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:27,011
she went toward
it. She chose it.

700
00:31:28,138 --> 00:31:30,598
Instead of us. So maybe...
-Maybe...

701
00:31:33,018 --> 00:31:34,936
Maybe not all monsters are bad.

702
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:40,692
Yeah.

703
00:31:40,775 --> 00:31:43,069
If you could go back to
the old you, would you?

704
00:31:46,197 --> 00:31:48,450
If you created a
cure, would I take it?

705
00:31:49,117 --> 00:31:50,869
Yeah. Yeah.

706
00:31:53,747 --> 00:31:55,623
This...

707
00:31:56,207 --> 00:32:01,212
this version of me saved
Cooper and Jordan and

708
00:32:02,172 --> 00:32:03,882
stopped my sister from dying.

709
00:32:04,591 --> 00:32:05,968
[Em laughs]

710
00:32:06,051 --> 00:32:07,719
Who would turn
their back on that?

711
00:32:09,971 --> 00:32:12,891
Somebody who wanted
to be normal?

was here that night.</i>

719
00:32:45,173 --> 00:32:48,176
He wanted to discuss some
fella chilling in the morgue.

720
00:32:49,094 --> 00:32:50,929
Ya know, chilling?

721
00:32:51,346 --> 00:32:53,515
Yeah, I got it. Tell
me about the guy.

722
00:32:53,598 --> 00:32:55,976
Yeah, right. So,
Deputy Brent said

723
00:32:56,059 --> 00:32:58,186
that the fella had
taken his own life

724
00:32:58,269 --> 00:33:01,231
and his poor family just
wanted him cremated right away

725
00:33:01,314 --> 00:33:03,983
so as to not make a fuss
and, you know, upset folks.

726
00:33:04,818 --> 00:33:07,070
It's a shame, really,
is what it is.

727
00:33:07,153 --> 00:33:08,488
You know, a lotta fellas our age
don't prioritize mental health

728
00:33:08,571 --> 00:33:10,699
as much as they should.
It's an epidemic, honestly,

729
00:33:10,782 --> 00:33:12,993
is what it is. That's
why I myself have

730
00:33:13,076 --> 00:33:15,037
a therapist and a life coach.

731
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,914

00:33:20,291 --> 00:33:21,668

735
00:33:21,751 --> 00:33:23,211
Well, - [sighs]

736
00:33:23,294 --> 00:33:26,548
for starters, it
was on Revival Day.

737
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:29,134
Jeez, if that night
doesn't haunt me

738
00:33:29,217 --> 00:33:30,719
every time I close my eyes.

739
00:33:31,177 --> 00:33:33,138
What happened?

740
00:33:33,221 --> 00:33:35,140
The poor guy revived right
as he went in the fire.

743
00:33:39,561 --> 00:33:41,647
and ran right past us
like a flaming Cheeto.

-Yeah, yeah. May Tao. Yeah.
-What was May Tao doing here?

749
00:33:52,907 --> 00:33:54,701
She said she was
working on a story

750
00:33:54,784 --> 00:33:56,161
on account that she's a
journalist, or whatever,

751
00:33:56,244 --> 00:33:58,246
and, uh, she wanted to
interview little old me,

752
00:33:58,329 --> 00:34:01,124
which I thought was pretty dope.
-[inhales sharply]

753
00:34:01,207 --> 00:34:03,794
But turns out all she really
wanted to talk about was

754
00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:06,087
the soon-to-be-burnt John
Doe that Brent brought in.

755
00:34:06,838 --> 00:34:08,048
If the family
identified the body

756
00:34:08,131 --> 00:34:10,550
why did the tag say John Doe?

757
00:34:10,633 --> 00:34:12,844
I don't know. I just figured
it was his real name.

758
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:16,681
What was the story
May was working on?

759
00:34:17,098 --> 00:34:18,933
She said she was
working on a special.

760
00:34:19,768 --> 00:34:23,188
On the most interesting
jobs in Wausau.

761

Can you beat that?

762
00:34:25,607 --> 00:34:27,025
I have one of the
most interesting jobs

763
00:34:27,108 --> 00:34:28,944
in all of Wausau.

764
00:34:29,027 --> 00:34:30,946
May Tao was here
at 9 p.m. at night

765
00:34:31,029 --> 00:34:33,699
to work on a story about
quirky little townie jobs?

766
00:34:33,782 --> 00:34:35,617
Not quirky little townie jobs.

767
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,286

00:37:32,669 --> 00:37:34,463
He was right there!

827
00:37:34,546 --> 00:37:36,548
And I didn't know for
sure, but I had a hunch.

828
00:37:36,631 --> 00:37:38,633
He tried to kill me
again an hour later!

829
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:41,428
Yeah. I came to you

830
00:37:41,511 --> 00:37:44,765
to help you and you said
to your actual killer

831
00:37:44,848 --> 00:37:46,558
watch out for me.

832
00:37:57,027 --> 00:37:58,820
What is all this?

833
00:37:58,903 --> 00:38:00,989
Are you looking into
my sister's murder too?

834
00:38:01,573 --> 00:38:03,158
Your sister was murdered?

835
00:38:04,492 --> 00:38:07,371
Wait, so Em is a reviver?

836
00:38:07,454 --> 00:38:08,997
Yes. Catch up, woman.

837
00:38:09,831 --> 00:38:11,750
I don't know anything
about that, okay?

838
00:38:11,833 --> 00:38:13,043
I've just been
looking for justice

839
00:38:13,126 --> 00:38:15,170
for Rose and for Jesse.

840
00:38:15,879 --> 00:38:18,548
We both know he didn't do it.
-Yeah, of course not.

841
00:38:18,631 --> 00:38:20,592
[crunching]

842
00:38:20,675 --> 00:38:23,511
But what does that have
to do with Brent and me?

843
00:38:24,721 --> 00:38:26,181
Brent killed Jesse.

844
00:38:26,973 --> 00:38:28,684
No. [scoffs]

845
00:38:28,767 --> 00:38:30,769
Jesse escaped.
-I think you're missing a few...

846
00:38:30,852 --> 00:38:33,939
And what were you really doing
at Randy's on Revival Night?

847
00:38:34,022 --> 00:38:35,690
I was there.

848
00:38:36,566 --> 00:38:38,944
I saw Brent leaving
the crematorium.

849
00:38:39,027 --> 00:38:41,947
He dropped off a body
on Revival Night.

850
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:44,074
A John Doe.

851
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,452
Well, who's the John Doe?
Is he connected to all this?

852
00:38:48,536 --> 00:38:50,372
[score abates]

853
00:38:50,455 --> 00:38:52,123
You want to ask him yourself?

00:38:53,124 --> 00:38:55,460
-[dramatic boom]
-[helicopter approaching]

855
00:38:56,503 --> 00:38:58,213
[tense dramatic score]

-[loud door release buzzer]
-[metal clanging]

857
00:39:01,174 --> 00:39:03,427
You see nothing,
you say nothing.

858
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:06,221
Shifts are on the wall.
Phones are left at the door.

859
00:39:06,304 --> 00:39:07,889
Understand?

860
00:39:10,684 --> 00:39:12,143
[loud metallic bang]

861
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,815

[score fades out]

864
00:39:22,529 --> 00:39:24,864
So, uh, this eye mask,

865
00:39:25,615 --> 00:39:27,034
like a sex thing, or what?

866
00:39:27,117 --> 00:39:28,827
You wish.

867
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:31,663
It's to protect my friends.
-From what?

868
00:39:31,746 --> 00:39:34,708
From you. Can you
just wait a second?

869
00:39:34,791 --> 00:39:36,460
It will all make
sense very shortly.

870
00:39:36,543 --> 00:39:38,045
[quiet tender score]

871
00:39:38,128 --> 00:39:39,922
What was the deal
with you and Rose?

872
00:39:40,005 --> 00:39:42,591
Have you ever looked
up the word patience

873
00:39:42,674 --> 00:39:44,968
in a dictionary?
-Gosh, you're charming.

874
00:39:45,051 --> 00:39:46,678
No wonder you're single.

875
00:39:46,761 --> 00:39:48,763
[clattering] Ah! Shit!

876
00:39:49,681 --> 00:39:51,683
Sorry. I didn't see that one.

877
00:39:51,766 --> 00:39:53,184
How much further?

878
00:39:54,936 --> 00:39:56,563
May?

[tender score]

882
00:40:11,036 --> 00:40:13,872
You're okay? You're better?
He figured out how to fix you?

883
00:40:13,955 --> 00:40:15,623
He did!

884
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:18,001
Where is he? Where's Ibrahim.

885
00:40:18,084 --> 00:40:20,253
Back at Moore Creek. I
couldn't bring him with me.

886
00:40:21,129 --> 00:40:22,631
What? Why not?

887
00:40:22,714 --> 00:40:24,591
It wasn't up to me.

888
00:40:24,674 --> 00:40:26,259
Someone else brought me here.

889
00:40:30,263 --> 00:40:32,383
-[door handle clatters]
-[door hinges loudly squeak]

890
00:40:35,727 --> 00:40:37,562
[feet clunk on steps]

891
00:40:42,192 --> 00:40:43,694
Hi, Dana.

892
00:40:43,777 --> 00:40:45,153
[stirring dramatic score]

893
00:40:54,704 --> 00:40:56,164
Jesse Blackdeer?

00:41:00,835 --> 00:41:02,170
-[deep sigh]
-[score abates]

895
00:41:02,253 --> 00:41:03,922
I don't understand.

896
00:41:04,005 --> 00:41:06,174
I let you go. I thought
you made it out.

897
00:41:06,257 --> 00:41:07,718
I did.

898
00:41:07,801 --> 00:41:09,761
On the run for two years.

899
00:41:09,844 --> 00:41:12,180
Trying to mourn my Rose in
peace, but no peace came.

900
00:41:12,931 --> 00:41:14,808
So I returned here to
Wausau to find answers

901
00:41:14,891 --> 00:41:16,601
and find my Rose.

902
00:41:16,684 --> 00:41:18,019
I'm done running.

903
00:41:20,355 --> 00:41:22,755
Whoever killed Rose made sure
that they were waiting for him.

904
00:41:23,024 --> 00:41:25,068
And since I've been reborn
I've been hiding here.

905
00:41:25,819 --> 00:41:28,030
And thanks to Uncle
Don, I've been safe

906
00:41:28,113 --> 00:41:30,353
and been able to work close
with May to find the answers.

907
00:41:32,075 --> 00:41:34,119
I wish I could
welcome you, Dana,

908
00:41:34,285 --> 00:41:39,166
But I don't wish to have
Cypress troubles on tribal land.

909
00:41:39,249 --> 00:41:42,794
Respectfully, Uncle,
their woes belong to us.

910
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,172
The families intertwined
and so are our stories.

911
00:41:47,007 --> 00:41:48,800
What... what do you mean?

912
00:41:50,135 --> 00:41:51,762
Whoever killed me and my Rose,

913
00:41:51,845 --> 00:41:53,304
[dramatic score]

914
00:41:55,724 --> 00:41:57,184
They killed you, too.
