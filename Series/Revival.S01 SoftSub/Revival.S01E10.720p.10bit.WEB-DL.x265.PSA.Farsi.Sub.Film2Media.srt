1
00:00:04,629 --> 00:00:07,775
<i>- Previously on revival.</i>
- Em healed me.

2
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,235
What do you mean she healed you?

3
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,737
- <i>She's special, dad.</i>
- I'm working through some stuff

4
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:13,864
and a friend said it'd be a
good idea to get closure.

5
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:15,116
Patricia cypress.

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,702
Can you see her, too? It was all my fault!

7
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:20,496
Anyone moves, the doctor dies.

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,063
He's found a way to kill revivers.

9
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:23,606
<i>This isn't mine!</i>

10
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:26,502
- Wanna go to the beach.
- On an adventure together.

11
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,296
- They have a girl!
- Where are you?

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,822
<i>I'm out on route 13, by the old church.</i>

13
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:35,243
<i>In these dark weeks</i>

14
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:39,205
<i>we have heard over and
over this term: Revival.</i>

15
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:43,168
<i>A sacred word meant to
represent spiritual renewal.</i>

16
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:46,355
<i>That word has been hijacked and defiled</i>

17
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,089
<i>by a plague of revenants,</i>

18
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:50,967
<i>of revivers who now walk amongst us.</i>

19
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:57,992
In revelations, John speaks
of the ancient serpent,

20
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:00,810
who, when he's cast out, the demons

21
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:03,021
are cast out with him.

22
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:06,107
And now I want you all

23
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:10,528
to bear witness as I cast out this demon

24
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:15,116
and end Satan's reign within wausau!

25
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,661
You couldn't keep me dead the first time.

26
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,914
You're not going to keep
me dead this time, either.

27
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:23,541
I never laid a hand on you.

28
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,839
But now my angel will.

29
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:33,254
You do know that my
father foretold this, right?

30
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:36,865
An angel of the lord
would reveal itself to me

31
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,410
and the day after revival
day it did, in the woods.

32
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,412
And it was

33
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,335
it was beautiful.

34
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:54,424
I'd never seen anything like it.

35
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,429
And then the angel...

36
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,682
Spoke to me.

37
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,435
In pained agony

38
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,358
it said Rose's name.

39
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,947
That's not an angel, Blaine.

40
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,575
That's confirmation bias.

41
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,869
You could put that on your radio show.

42
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,956
You see this?

43
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,479
The celestial cannot be
touched by human flesh.

44
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:34,839
I watched it obliterate a reviver

45
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:36,901
and send it back to the depths of hell.

46
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:40,512
Yeah. Yeah, I saw one, too.

47
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,324
But what I saw was it
connect with a reviver,

48
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:47,394
not in an act of damnation,
but in an act of reunion.

49
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,247
You so badly want your father to be right

50
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:52,440
that you're willing to
kill people to prove it.

51
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,735
I don't know if that's a
leap of faith or fear, Blaine.

52
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,571
Doug.

53
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:02,075
Clarice? Come in.

54
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:05,370
<i>Anybody? What's the status?</i>

55
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:08,581
<i>What's going on over there?</i>

56
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,001
Doug, come in.

57
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,130
The angel was supposed
to be here by now.

58
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,609
Get down to the creek
and find out what's going on!

59
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:19,884
Yes, sir!

60
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:25,056
The reviver woman.
The one you tortured.

61
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,326
You mean the one I exterminated.

62
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,227
The one you tortured.
What was her name?

63
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,773
Her name, doctor,

64
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:36,711
died when she did.

65
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:40,530
What came out of that
grave, that was a vessel of evil.

66
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:44,784
I saw the video, Blaine.
What did Wanda say?

67
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:49,181
What did she say before you killed her?

68
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,707
It's not mine.

69
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:54,461
She said, "it's not mine" over and over.

70
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:57,213
What does that mean?

71
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,633
See, in islam we believe
that when a person dies,

72
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,927
their soul is separated from their body.

73
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,406
And it enters an intermediate state.

74
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,892
A transitional barrier between
this world and the next.

75
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:13,146
That light that you saw on
revival night, that was em.

76
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:17,442
What if somehow her
death broke that barrier?

77
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,780
I mean, that's a...

78
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:28,953
A bold and spiritual
hypothesis for a man of science.

79
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:33,166
Well, science, it's about
being open to change

80
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,418
when presented with new evidence.

81
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,422
You see, you witnessed
something you can't explain, Blaine,

82
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:44,010
and you've assigned it a
variable based on conjecture.

83
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:47,847
Now, see, I would say

84
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:50,642
that I am a man of conviction

85
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:54,396
who's not going to stand idly by

86
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:58,024
as the gates of hell are at my doorstep.

87
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,748
Over here! Took you long enough.

88
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,667
Hey! Don't move!

89
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,629
Drop your weapons!

90
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,715
Sorry.

91
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,492
My god. Martha!

92
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,327
- Dad!
- Are you okay, baby?

93
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,895
Whoa, whoa. Hey! Right there is good.

94
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:40,710
You harm one hair on her
head, you son of a bitch,

95
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,111
I'll rip your lungs out, so help me

96
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:46,382
god? Is that what you were going to say?

97
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,158
So help me god? How poetic.

98
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,389
Coming from the man who
ran my father out of town,

99
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,057
destroyed our church.

100
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,977
Now you're going to be
here to witness firsthand

101
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:02,047
as my angel sends
this demon back to hell.

102
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,259
Wait!

103
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,011
She healed me.

104
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,058
Like, she healed you?

105
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,894
Yeah.

106
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:20,774
Just like Christ with the guy in the...

107
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:25,963
The walking problem.

108
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,156
- The guy with the skin!
- The leper.

109
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,949
The leper.

110
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:33,078
I was shot and I was stabbed

111
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:37,707
and she put her hands
over me and healed me.

112
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,758
So,

113
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,970
I mean, I guess that makes her...

114
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:54,974
Special, right?

115
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,068
Yes.

116
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:08,673
No!

117
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:11,282
Damn. Shit.

118
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:13,344
Dad. Dad.

119
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,120
- Now she can prove it.
- Dad.

120
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:24,379
Dad.

121
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,755
Damn it!

122
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:35,950
What?

123
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,618
- No.
- Did you give her the serum!?

124
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,120
I did! She must need a larger dose.

125
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:42,873
It's going to be okay.

126
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,482
Em, just stay calm.

127
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,276
Please, just stay calm. Please.

128
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,486
Yeah.

129
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:55,035
Okay. You can do this.

130
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,537
Just breathe, okay? You have to focus.

131
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,664
You have to breathe, em. Breathe.

132
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,208
I don't know why it's not working!

133
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,795
- Who's the charlatan now?
- Shut up, Blaine!

134
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:08,691
Take your sister and go.

135
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,259
Dad, stop, please! I think...

136
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,822
I think I just need to focus, okay?

137
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:16,824
So, what are you? Are you a healer?

138
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:19,184
You the oppressor? Do you even know?

139
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,980
I love you both.

140
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:27,233
I'm sorry. For everything.

141
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,533
You coward!

142
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:39,954
I love you both so much.

143
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,386
Em!

144
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:00,308
Em. Em, look.

145
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:18,410
You did it.

146
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,042
Em! Someone help. Em!

147
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,502
Blaine, I can save her.

148
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,398
Hey. I have a vial in my
pocket that can help her.

149
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:33,466
- What's wrong with her?
- Is she dying?

150
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:35,135
You say you're not a killer.

151
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,513
This is your time to prove it.
Free me and let me save her.

152
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,061
Sorry. I can't take that risk.

153
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:48,624
<i>Put it down!</i>

154
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,293
Hey, hey! Let's go! Let's go!

155
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,628
<i>Release the reviver immediately!</i>

156
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,279
<i>Drop your weapons!</i>

157
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,009
<i>Put them down!</i>

158
00:10:58,033 --> 00:10:59,909
<i>You've got nowhere to go, Blaine.</i>

159
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:01,453
<i>Your flock is dead.</i>

160
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:03,431
Can you get these off?

161
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:05,683
<i>Second team, prepare to breach.</i>

162
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,393
All right, listen: This will help.

163
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,770
This will help but you have
to get her to Moore creek

164
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,564
and get her in the water, okay?

165
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:14,007
- We'll sneak out the basement.
- There you go.

166
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:15,967
<i>Time to surrender, Blaine.</i>

167
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,927
<i>This is over!</i>

168
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,221
This is our battle.

169
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,390
Do not <i>surrender!</i>

170
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,268
<i>They have our angel!</i>

171
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,817
Send her with me. I've got a place

172
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,403
right around the bend. It's the grist mill

173
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,072
downstream from the creek.

174
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,508
- Could-could that water help?
- Yes, yes, yes, maybe.

175
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,910
I'll get her to Lester's. See
if she gets her power back.

176
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,888
We need to get her to
nella and jp at the tunnels.

177
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,723
Go, go!

178
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:47,499
Drop your weapons!

179
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,877
I'll deal with the general.
She's my problem.

180
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:52,813
You get Cooper, get your sister well,

181
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,273
- then get the hell out of wausau.
- Okay.

182
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:56,400
- Dad, you need to be careful.
- I'll go to jp and nella.

183
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,611
- Go! Just go.
- Let's go! Let's go!

184
00:11:58,635 --> 00:11:59,886
Come on.

185
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:01,638
Nobody gets out of here.

186
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,184
Where is she?!

187
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,830
<i>How much further?</i>

188
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,981
<i>It's just up this way to the mill.</i>

189
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:15,819
Do you need help getting her up?

190
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:16,944
Nah.

191
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:18,196
Strong as an ox.

192
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:23,243
Here. Keys to my truck.

193
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:24,995
Thank you. Hey.

194
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:27,848
Get your strength back, okay?
I'm going to go get Cooper

195
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:30,667
and then we're out of here.

196
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:32,794
Together.

197
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,480
Can we stop and split a doughnut

198
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:37,090
- from Friedman's on the way?
- You know it.

199
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,946
Go.

200
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,514
<i>No, ma'am.</i> Let me explain. Ye

201
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,519
yes, ma'am. I understand. I

202
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,897
yes. Right away.

203
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:01,531
We can still get them,
ma'am. Our mission is not over.

204
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:05,410
Delayed. Not over. Now go.

205
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:10,057
So, let me get this straight:
You lose all the revivers

206
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:12,101
and in an effort to get them back,

207
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,836
you mow down 12 civilians at a church.

208
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:17,589
And you're the one
who cleans up messes?

209
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,051
<i>Command, this is bravo.</i>

210
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,946
<i>There's something you need to see.</i>

211
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,573
What is it?

212
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:27,265
<i>I think we found one.</i>

213
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:46,034
Here, drink this.

214
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,083
Good.

215
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:57,587
Now, you just rest up.

216
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,225
I'm going to go check to
make sure nobody followed us.

217
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:12,560
Okay.

218
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:23,965
He's been like this ever
since I picked him up.

219
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:26,032
Just not talking, like,

220
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:28,576
like the joy's just gone
right out of him, you know?

221
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:31,246
He's been through so much.
I can't imagine what's going

222
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,498
- through his head.
- I know. I know.

223
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:35,810
Thank you so much for looking after him.

224
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:37,460
Are you kidding? Anytime.

225
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,438
He's a sweetie.

226
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:41,965
- Thanks. Just one sec.
- Yeah.

227
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:45,277
- Lester, how's em?
<i>- She's okay.</i>

228
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:48,155
Pretty worn down, but I
think the water helped some.

229
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:50,825
<i>Might not be as potent
as what the doc has</i>

230
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:52,159
<i>but she's taken to it.</i>

231
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:54,704
Okay. I'm grabbing
Cooper and I'll be right over.

232
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:57,022
<i>Well, now, you might
want to hold off there.</i>

233
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:58,940
There still seem to be a bunch of soldiers

234
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:01,836
just down by the creek. But, don't worry.

235
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,296
<i>Em is safe and sound right here.</i>

236
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,840
Okay, well, call me as
soon as the coast is clear.

237
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:08,366
<i>Will do, deputy cypress.</i> Will do.

238
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,129
- What happened?
- It's how we found it.

239
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:25,884
We think it's Wanda Peterson's.

240
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:27,927
Alert Alpha.

241
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:30,055
Our exit timeline just got accelerated.

242
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,848
And the sheriff?

243
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:35,643
Let him go.

244
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,187
We don't need him anymore.

245
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:40,815
We won't be going home
empty-handed after all.

246
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:47,298
Aw, Coop and I had so much fun, Dana.

247
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:52,261
We watched cartoons and he
showed me his comic drawings.

248
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,329
My goodness!

249
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:57,624
They are so good. He could
be a professional artist someday.

250
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:59,793
Jesus.

251
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:02,754
We even watched the bucks game.

252
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:06,734
But they lost to the pacers again.

253
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:08,819
But, listen:

254
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:11,721
I will look after him anytime.

255
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:19,622
Well, okey-dokey, smokey.

256
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,374
I think I got everything here for you.

257
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:23,417
Where did you get this?

258
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:27,004
What? That old snoozer?

259
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:30,281
I thought it was going to be
a rip-roaring romance novel,

260
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:31,658
but no such luck.

261
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:35,662
It's just a boring old book
about water, you know.

262
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:39,332
<i>But people seem to
like it. He even did this</i>

263
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,894
<i>mind-numbing speech about it.</i>

264
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:45,106
<i>Hang on. You've seen
an Aaron weimer lecture?</i>

265
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,631
Yeah.

266
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:50,194
Well, it's actually on a tape
around here somewhere.

267
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:52,387
Can I see it?

268
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:04,357
<i>Many adherents see the river as</i>

269
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:07,670
<i>the earthly manifestation
of the goddess gang a.</i>

270
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:11,132
<i>They regularly attribute healing
and transformative powers</i>

271
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:13,467
<i>- to its flow.</i>
- And why do you have this?

272
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:16,286
- This is all Lester's stuff.
- Wait, what?

273
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:20,975
<i>Millions performing ritual Lester.</i>

274
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:22,893
- What is he doing?
- Nothing!

275
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,061
You don't want to see this.

276
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:25,754
- I'm so sorry.
- Could you stop it?

277
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:27,380
Yeah, yeah. Oops, that's pause.

278
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:29,358
- Christ, Jeannie! Give me that!
- Is it coming out?

279
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,384
What? What? What?

280
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,178
What are you doing?

281
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:37,724
What, what? That?

282
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:40,244
My god. I hate that thing. It's...

283
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:42,705
He's Irish. It's Celtic,
or something like that.

284
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,189
Gives me the creeps.

285
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:15,970
Hello, Martha.

286
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:25,814
It was you?

287
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:28,942
You killed me?

288
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:31,420
Now, now, dear, just hold on.

289
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:34,447
It wasn't me. It was your professor.

290
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,991
Although that's a bit of a technicality.

291
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:38,827
No, no, no. I...

292
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,831
I saw the mask. You-you
knocked out Aaron

293
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:44,600
and you tried to kill me.

294
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:47,186
I should return the goddamn favour.

295
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,896
Wait!

296
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,340
Look... You could kill me,

297
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:56,344
but then you'll never know the truth.

298
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:00,432
You're weak, Martha.

299
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:03,059
But the water from the
creek helps you, no?

300
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:05,854
It makes sense.

301
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:07,814
It's one of a few places on the earth

302
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:10,650
where the membrane
between oblivion and awareness

303
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:11,943
is thinnest.

304
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:15,363
And it flows right through this very mill.

305
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:19,784
Please,

306
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:21,911
let me help you.

307
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:26,541
Why the hell would I trust you?

308
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,710
Because I need you.

309
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:31,212
The world needs you.

310
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:35,550
Why did I have to die?

311
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:39,387
You were never part of
my plan. That was all Aaron.

312
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:42,849
<i>His infidelity and his wife's cancer</i>

313
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:45,536
<i>could both be solved by your death.</i>

314
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,330
So, he picked you.

315
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:49,665
Tried to make it look like a suicide.

316
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:52,543
<i>He was my partner at first, I admit,</i>

317
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:55,671
<i>but he was a sloppy, sloppy man</i>

318
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,798
and he parked a car on my property.

319
00:19:57,822 --> 00:19:59,908
<i>And when I called Blaine to tow it,</i>

320
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:01,993
<i>I realized he was trying to cut me out</i>

321
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:04,722
<i>and steal our discovery
for himself and his wife.</i>

322
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:09,185
<i>But his poor choices
created, well, a mess.</i>

323
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:10,960
I can take you down with me.

324
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:13,254
<i>So be it.</i>

325
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,610
<i>I did my best to clean it up,
tie up Aaron's loose ends.</i>

326
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:19,260
I bet you I could figure it out.

327
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:26,935
<i>There was, unfortunately,
some collateral damage</i>

328
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:29,938
<i>of which I'm so regretful.</i>

329
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:32,667
<i>But I had to see this through</i>

330
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:35,485
<i>not just for me, but
for the world, Martha!</i>

331
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:40,198
And try to do what?

332
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:43,576
What we are all trying to do. Live.

333
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:45,787
For as long as we possibly can.

334
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:48,540
So that's

335
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,520
what this was all for?
So that your old ass

336
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:54,355
doesn't have to die?

337
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:56,089
Not just me.

338
00:20:56,715 --> 00:20:58,609
Can you imagine what it would be like

339
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:01,278
to give the gift of eternal life?

340
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:03,614
You didn't give life. You took it!

341
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:05,700
And not just from me, but from Rose.

342
00:21:05,724 --> 00:21:08,393
Someone who had her
whole life ahead of her.

343
00:21:08,518 --> 00:21:10,913
People loved her and
you stole that from her!

344
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:14,649
You killed two innocent
women. You-you killed me!

345
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:18,421
All for some power trip
that, given what happened,

346
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:20,530
you, you clearly...

347
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,037
There, there. Save your energy.

348
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:30,415
We didn't know what would work.

349
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,960
But we needed a vessel.

350
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:37,672
A young woman capable of creating life.

351
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,650
<i>Rose was the first.</i>

352
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:42,761
<i>- And through her death...</i>
- I've got her. -<i>It would</i>

353
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:44,054
allow us to open the door.

354
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:48,826
But then we saw the light
coming out from within her.

355
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:51,311
It was working!

356
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:53,581
<i>And in a flash, it was over.</i>

357
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:55,708
But it was enough to let
us know that we were right.

358
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:58,109
All those years, all the searching.

359
00:21:58,526 --> 00:22:00,212
The research!

360
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:02,781
It was all finally within my grasp.

361
00:22:02,906 --> 00:22:07,035
And that's why I bought
the mill and built all of this.

362
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:09,287
To do it right!

363
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:12,040
No one would laugh at me now.

364
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:16,461
Then your petulant ex-lover

365
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:19,714
decided he wanted to
try and steal it for himself!

366
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:29,617
<i>This was supposed to be a sacred ritual</i>

367
00:22:29,641 --> 00:22:33,061
<i>that demanded our
respect and Patience!</i>

368
00:22:34,688 --> 00:22:36,690
<i>But he was so cocky and</i>

369
00:22:36,815 --> 00:22:38,441
<i>thought he could just scoop it up</i>

370
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:40,360
<i>and take it home to his wife.</i>

371
00:22:43,238 --> 00:22:44,548
<i>I couldn't allow it.</i>

372
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:48,344
<i>I would not be undermined by such a</i>

373
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:50,787
pusillanimous mendicant!

374
00:22:58,628 --> 00:23:00,564
Forgive me.

375
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:02,799
I don't normally lose my temper.

376
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:08,221
The irony of life is that it is lived forward,

377
00:23:08,346 --> 00:23:10,098
but understood backward.

378
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:12,642
Listen to me, Martha. Look around you.

379
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:16,855
Rose's death, your death, led to life.

380
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,107
We have reunited families.

381
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:20,859
You did that.

382
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:24,279
Because you are so very special.

383
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:32,287
I'm not special.

384
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:37,834
You used me, just like Aaron and Blaine.

385
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:40,336
No, you are special.

386
00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:43,524
You see, in order to unlock
the door to immortality,

387
00:23:43,548 --> 00:23:46,718
you need a key and that key was you.

388
00:23:46,843 --> 00:23:50,698
Something in you, Martha
cypress, caused all of this.

389
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:53,016
You weren't just a key,
you were a detonator

390
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:55,060
<i>that blew the door right off!</i>

391
00:24:07,322 --> 00:24:09,717
You started revival day!

392
00:24:09,741 --> 00:24:13,804
I am done with this and
with you. I will make sure

393
00:24:13,828 --> 00:24:15,872
- you rot in prison.
- Don't you want to see it?

394
00:24:19,334 --> 00:24:21,795
Behind those doors lies a part of you.

395
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,481
<i>I couldn't let Blaine take</i>

396
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:25,465
<i>this one. He confused its purpose.</i>

397
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,485
<i>It's not his.</i>

398
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:28,986
<i>It's yours.</i>

399
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,638
And if you open
yourself to it, it will come.

400
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:35,951
You've felt something missing
ever since you woke up, no?

401
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:38,686
Well, this will make you whole.

402
00:24:40,397 --> 00:24:43,233
But you have to be willing.

403
00:24:43,358 --> 00:24:44,693
The decision is yours.

404
00:24:47,612 --> 00:24:48,780
What is it?

405
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:54,786
It's your soul, Martha.

406
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:12,721
Follow it to the water, Martha.

407
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:16,224
Let it fill the void inside of you.

408
00:25:36,411 --> 00:25:38,997
I know this a lot to take in, Martha.

409
00:25:40,749 --> 00:25:43,043
But you are special.

410
00:25:44,836 --> 00:25:48,339
And if you venture into
the water, I'll prove it.

411
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,015
Mom?

412
00:25:59,517 --> 00:26:01,186
Martha, come here.

413
00:26:03,688 --> 00:26:06,191
<i>It's okay. I'm here now.</i>

414
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:11,946
<i>I forgive you. Here's my
Martha. We can be together.</i>

415
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:15,283
<i>It's not your fault. There's my Martha.</i>

416
00:26:16,201 --> 00:26:18,763
<i>- It'll be okay. I forgive you.</i>
- I'm so sorry.

417
00:26:18,787 --> 00:26:21,539
It'll be okay.

418
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:26,127
<i>There's my Martha.
Put all this behind you.</i>

419
00:26:27,045 --> 00:26:31,716
Come with me and heal.
Put all this behind you.

420
00:26:32,884 --> 00:26:34,427
<i>It's not your fault.</i>

421
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:39,265
<i>I forgive you. I forgive
you. We can be together.</i>

422
00:26:39,766 --> 00:26:41,684
<i>I forgive you. My baby.</i>

423
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:45,230
My perfect little miracle baby.

424
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:48,983
<i>There you go.</i>

425
00:27:00,704 --> 00:27:02,163
Lester!

426
00:27:30,275 --> 00:27:32,819
Something's wrong.

427
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:37,550
What's happening?! Em!

428
00:27:37,574 --> 00:27:39,468
What's happening?! Em?

429
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:46,017
I... Don't... Know!

430
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:49,586
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.

431
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:51,147
It's okay.

432
00:27:51,171 --> 00:27:53,173
It's o... it's okay.

433
00:27:57,344 --> 00:27:59,054
We finally

434
00:27:59,888 --> 00:28:02,098
got to have that adventure together.

435
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:06,871
Em. Em, em.

436
00:28:06,895 --> 00:28:09,147
Em, em, no.

437
00:28:09,773 --> 00:28:11,524
Em, please. No.

438
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:14,045
Say it. Say it's okay.

439
00:28:14,069 --> 00:28:16,529
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

440
00:28:27,874 --> 00:28:29,709
No.

441
00:28:32,087 --> 00:28:33,731
Em! Em!

442
00:28:33,755 --> 00:28:35,507
Em!!

443
00:28:44,182 --> 00:28:46,601
<i>No. God.</i>

444
00:28:47,143 --> 00:28:49,080
She's over here!

445
00:28:49,104 --> 00:28:51,564
Jesus.

446
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:53,108
<i>Shut it down.</i>

447
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:54,776
Dana. Dana.

448
00:28:54,901 --> 00:28:56,545
<i>Sheriff, no sign of Martha in here.</i>

449
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:58,780
Are you okay? Where's Martha?

450
00:29:00,532 --> 00:29:02,283
Where's Martha?

451
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:09,183
<i>With revivers still among us,</i>

452
00:29:09,207 --> 00:29:13,044
<i>how can we be sure that
history will not repeat itself?</i>

453
00:29:13,336 --> 00:29:16,464
<i>Jamie, I'm going to nip this in the bud.</i>

454
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,110
<i>Revivers were not the problem then</i>

455
00:29:19,134 --> 00:29:21,428
<i>and they're certainly
not the problem now.</i>

456
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:25,199
<i>As you may know, my wife is a reviver.</i>

457
00:29:25,223 --> 00:29:28,101
<i>It's a fact that we had to, keep hidden</i>

458
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,520
<i>for the safety of our family.</i>

459
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:36,317
<i>But no one should be made
to feel unsafe or unwelcome</i>

460
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:37,777
<i>because of who they are.</i>

461
00:29:38,236 --> 00:29:43,074
<i>Which is why the governor
is spearheading efforts to,</i>

462
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:46,387
<i>pass this new bill now
that ensures the rights of</i>

463
00:29:46,411 --> 00:29:48,431
<i>all revitalized citizens.</i>

464
00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:51,291
<i>I think there's still a lot of anxiety...</i>

465
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:52,518
Coop, come on, buddy!

466
00:29:52,542 --> 00:29:55,604
<i>Confusion surrounding
the military's presence</i>

467
00:29:55,628 --> 00:29:57,648
<i>and their sudden disappearance.</i>

468
00:29:57,672 --> 00:29:59,049
<i>Well, I've been assured by</i>

469
00:29:59,174 --> 00:30:01,468
<i>the governor herself that the,</i>

470
00:30:01,593 --> 00:30:02,635
whoa.

471
00:30:02,761 --> 00:30:05,531
<i>Cale's operation was unsanctioned</i>

472
00:30:05,555 --> 00:30:07,992
<i>and that a special committee
has been established</i>

473
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:10,411
<i>to investigate the matter in full.</i>

474
00:30:10,435 --> 00:30:14,123
<i>But I'm here to say, plain
as day, wausau is safe.</i>

475
00:30:14,147 --> 00:30:17,025
- Okay, all right, come on.
- <i>Welcome back.</i>

476
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,777
Cooper, we've got to go!

477
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:21,404
- Stop yelling, mom.
- Jesus!

478
00:30:22,364 --> 00:30:24,532
You're really good at
sneaking up on me in here.

479
00:30:25,075 --> 00:30:26,701
Sure you're ready for school?

480
00:30:27,285 --> 00:30:29,329
I really miss em.

481
00:30:29,454 --> 00:30:31,748
Yeah, I know. I know.

482
00:30:32,707 --> 00:30:35,186
After school we're going to
go talk to Dr. Park again, okay?

483
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:38,129
You like Dr. Park? She's nice, right?

484
00:30:39,214 --> 00:30:43,218
Then, tonight after school,

485
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:47,472
we finally finish unpacking your room.

486
00:30:47,972 --> 00:30:50,350
I already packed it once.
Shouldn't you be the one

487
00:30:50,475 --> 00:30:52,644
to unpack it now that we're staying here?

488
00:30:55,855 --> 00:30:57,982
Sometimes life's not fair, Coop.

489
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:02,153
All right. Go catch the bus.

490
00:31:02,821 --> 00:31:04,155
Off you go.

491
00:31:18,628 --> 00:31:19,772
How you holding up?

492
00:31:19,796 --> 00:31:21,297
Yeah.

493
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,925
About as good as can
be expected, I guess.

494
00:31:24,342 --> 00:31:27,303
Well, look, maybe a little
time off will do you good.

495
00:31:28,555 --> 00:31:30,181
Go fishing every morning.

496
00:31:31,516 --> 00:31:33,768
I'm just glad it's you taking over.

497
00:31:34,352 --> 00:31:36,479
You're exactly what the
town needs right now.

498
00:31:37,147 --> 00:31:39,333
Interim. We'll see how things go

499
00:31:39,357 --> 00:31:41,276
with the run-off election. I mean,

500
00:31:41,401 --> 00:31:44,738
I'm not that good at politics
and all that baby-kissing shit.

501
00:31:44,863 --> 00:31:46,072
And I was?

502
00:31:48,116 --> 00:31:49,760
What's going on with
the ladder, anyway?

503
00:31:49,784 --> 00:31:52,412
That's my first order of business.

504
00:31:52,537 --> 00:31:56,791
You know that leak that Dana
was complaining about all this time?

505
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,544
Yeah, well, turns out
that it actually starts here

506
00:31:59,669 --> 00:32:01,004
in your office.

507
00:32:06,468 --> 00:32:08,678
Now, Jean Paul,

508
00:32:10,472 --> 00:32:12,140
this is yours now.

509
00:32:14,934 --> 00:32:16,644
You're the right man for the job, brother.

510
00:32:18,063 --> 00:32:19,731
I'll see you down the road?

511
00:32:20,607 --> 00:32:21,900
All right, bro.

512
00:32:32,827 --> 00:32:34,245
Hello.

513
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:41,419
Hey, I, I come bearing gifts.

514
00:32:43,129 --> 00:32:44,732
You should have.

515
00:32:44,756 --> 00:32:46,508
I accept.

516
00:32:47,258 --> 00:32:50,696
Well, how do I look? No big coat.

517
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,514
And me.

518
00:32:53,223 --> 00:32:54,349
You look good.

519
00:32:54,474 --> 00:32:56,285
You ready for your first day, professor?

520
00:32:56,309 --> 00:33:00,081
Yeah, not a professor.
Just a short-term residency.

521
00:33:00,105 --> 00:33:01,481
Yeah.

522
00:33:01,606 --> 00:33:03,751
That's a relief. The last
cypress professor thing

523
00:33:03,775 --> 00:33:05,670
didn't end well.

524
00:33:05,694 --> 00:33:08,130
Yeah. I'm sorry about that.

525
00:33:08,154 --> 00:33:10,132
But it does keep me
closer to Moore creek

526
00:33:10,156 --> 00:33:13,201
so that I can continue my studies. So...

527
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:16,746
Is that the only thing
you want to stay close to?

528
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:19,708
Algae?

529
00:33:25,505 --> 00:33:27,942
I-I better get going. I don't want to be late

530
00:33:27,966 --> 00:33:30,301
- on my first day. It's no good.
- No.

531
00:33:34,973 --> 00:33:37,017
- Ibrahim!
- Yeah? Yeah?

532
00:33:41,438 --> 00:33:43,315
We should do it again sometime.

533
00:33:44,941 --> 00:33:46,484
Do, do what exactly?

534
00:33:48,236 --> 00:33:50,756
Dent a car and not leave a note.

535
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:53,241
Yeah, we should.

536
00:33:54,242 --> 00:33:56,661
Sometime. I'll see you around.

537
00:34:28,443 --> 00:34:30,004
[The past is never dead.

538
00:34:45,043 --> 00:34:46,437
<i>We stood on two legs;</i>

539
00:34:46,461 --> 00:34:49,464
<i>and raised our heads
above golden grass;</i>

540
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:51,716
<i>he was there.</i>

541
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,074
<i>We sharpened stone and
steel; Used tools to harvest grass,</i>

542
00:34:58,098 --> 00:34:59,808
<i>beast and brother;</i>

543
00:35:01,184 --> 00:35:02,852
<i>he was there.</i>

544
00:35:05,146 --> 00:35:08,024
<i>We clustered together; In brick and mud,</i>

545
00:35:08,149 --> 00:35:10,318
<i>swarming with rats and plague.</i>

546
00:35:11,861 --> 00:35:13,530
<i>He was there.</i>

547
00:35:14,989 --> 00:35:17,134
<i>We built nations and mistrust;</i>

548
00:35:17,158 --> 00:35:19,661
<i>our fingers hovered over the red button.</i>

549
00:35:23,164 --> 00:35:24,833
<i>He smiled.</i>

550
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:33,567
<i>But still we build to rise
above the golden grass;</i>

551
00:35:33,591 --> 00:35:36,678
<i>away from the reach of his scythe.</i>

552
00:35:40,724 --> 00:35:42,350
<i>For a day</i>

553
00:35:43,435 --> 00:35:46,604
<i>when he will harvest no more.</i>

554
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:05,165
You had everything else.
There's just that one box left.

555
00:36:07,834 --> 00:36:09,794
It really hit me going through her things.

556
00:36:09,919 --> 00:36:12,088
I mean...

557
00:36:14,507 --> 00:36:16,176
I miss her.

558
00:36:21,306 --> 00:36:23,016
I do too.

559
00:36:24,768 --> 00:36:27,187
I wish you hadn't told her
to go to the bridge that night.

560
00:36:29,147 --> 00:36:31,459
Excuse me?

561
00:36:31,483 --> 00:36:33,502
To get closure, or whatever.

562
00:36:33,526 --> 00:36:34,886
Since she wouldn't have been taken

563
00:36:34,986 --> 00:36:36,821
and revival day wouldn't have happened.

564
00:36:38,573 --> 00:36:40,450
What are you talking about?

565
00:36:41,368 --> 00:36:43,512
Em said a friend told
her to go the bridge.

566
00:36:43,536 --> 00:36:45,080
You're her only friend. I did the math

567
00:36:45,205 --> 00:36:46,373
and that sums up to you.

568
00:36:46,498 --> 00:36:50,377
Okay, no. No, look, we-we became cool.

569
00:36:50,752 --> 00:36:53,838
We became cool, but back
then we were just roomies.

570
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:57,443
It was probably one of
those online friends of hers

571
00:36:57,467 --> 00:37:03,199
from live journal or
that o1, oi forum thing.

572
00:37:03,223 --> 00:37:05,058
She was always chatting with them.

573
00:38:08,455 --> 00:38:11,541
Hi, may. I need a favour.

574
00:38:12,751 --> 00:38:15,128
Coop! Time for bed! Brush your teeth!

575
00:38:15,253 --> 00:38:17,338
I know!

576
00:38:26,806 --> 00:38:28,534
- Hey, dad. <i>- Hey!</i>

577
00:38:28,558 --> 00:38:31,954
I was wondering if, you know,

578
00:38:31,978 --> 00:38:34,123
maybe I could watch <i>Cooper soon?</i>

579
00:38:34,147 --> 00:38:38,610
Dad, I-I don't think that's a good idea.

580
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,487
He's still...

581
00:38:40,987 --> 00:38:43,907
Broken up about losing
em and he blames you for it.

582
00:38:45,075 --> 00:38:46,493
I'm sorry.

583
00:38:47,994 --> 00:38:51,331
<i>We're navigating
everything with a therapist</i>

584
00:38:51,456 --> 00:38:53,666
<i>and it's a lot right now</i>

585
00:38:53,792 --> 00:38:55,853
<i>and I think we just all need a bit of time.</i>

586
00:38:55,877 --> 00:38:59,273
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I get it.

587
00:38:59,297 --> 00:39:02,592
Sure. Okay.

588
00:39:03,635 --> 00:39:05,220
I should get him to bed.

589
00:39:05,345 --> 00:39:07,305
All right. Okay.

590
00:39:10,183 --> 00:39:11,577
Dad.

591
00:39:11,601 --> 00:39:13,496
<i>If you want to talk, you
know, just you and me,</i>

592
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,231
<i>we could talk.</i>

593
00:39:20,068 --> 00:39:21,319
You know...

594
00:39:23,613 --> 00:39:26,324
All right. We'll chat soon, then.

595
00:39:26,783 --> 00:39:29,494
Yeah. Okay. I guess so.

596
00:39:47,554 --> 00:39:49,240
May, did you get my lead?

597
00:39:49,264 --> 00:39:51,659
<i>- You sitting down?</i>
- Nope.

598
00:39:51,683 --> 00:39:54,269
<i>So, those message boards
you had me look into?</i>

599
00:39:54,394 --> 00:39:57,105
<i>You'll never guess where
the ip address was from.</i>

600
00:39:57,564 --> 00:39:59,417
<i>- The weimar house.</i>
- Yeah, that tracks.

601
00:39:59,441 --> 00:40:02,128
Aaron needed her on the
bridge to push the self-harm play

602
00:40:02,152 --> 00:40:03,879
so he lured her there.

603
00:40:03,903 --> 00:40:07,615
<i>Well, what do you know about his wife?</i>

604
00:40:07,741 --> 00:40:09,993
Nithiya? Why?

605
00:40:10,368 --> 00:40:13,413
<i>She was the court-appointed
therapist for em, right?</i>

606
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:16,851
<i>Well, turns out she
wasn't assigned em's case.</i>

607
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:20,187
<i>She asked for it. In fact,
she went out of her way</i>

608
00:40:20,211 --> 00:40:22,881
<i>to make sure she
would get em as a client.</i>

609
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:34,726
Mrs. Weimar!
