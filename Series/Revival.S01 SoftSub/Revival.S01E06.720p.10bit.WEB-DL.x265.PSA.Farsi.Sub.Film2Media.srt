<font face="monospaceSansSerif" color="white"> KEN: <i>Previously on Revival.</i>

2
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:09,633
If any revivers show signs
of aggression or violence,

3
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:11,677
remove them to a secure
location of your choosing.

4
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:13,679
Your sister's a reviver?

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,931
I want a truce.

6
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:18,517
Tell me my family is safe.
<i><font face="proportionalSansSerif" color="white">-Cross my heart, hope to die.</i>

7
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,561
You've been running ever since
you fumbled the Blackdeer case.

8
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:23,105
Did you hear it?

9
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:24,815
There's something out there.

10
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:26,525
Whoever shot him shot you.

11
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,819
I even fired back at them.

12
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,071
Lester saw the
shooter. It's a cop.

13
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:32,865
We found the bullet
that killed Aaron.

14
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,742
And your gun wasn't a match.

15
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:37,328
You'll never believe whose was.

16
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:39,080
McCray?

17
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:08,275
Oh, she's beautiful.

18
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:11,279
Hey. Say hello to your sister.

19
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,827
-What?
-What's wrong?

20
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:20,497
What's wrong?
-Why isn't she crying?

21
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,249
Why isn't she crying?

22
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:39,557
Oh, dude. What a day.
What a night. Jesus.

23
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,946
They got her hooked up
to all these machines.

24
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,607
Now she's in some
incubator thing.

25
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:52,236
I mean, it's crazy. She's
so tiny, so fragile.

26
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,196
Well, you knew
after Patty's cancer

27
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,198
there was a chance of this.

28
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,617
Complications, underdevelopment.
That was the risk.

29
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,577
But did we really
have to go through

30
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:03,372
all this hokey crystal,
water-birth bullshit?

31
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,749
I mean, come on! On top of that?

32
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,836
We should've been in the city
at a hospital! This is crazy!

33
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:11,880
She's all about the nature.
You can't move her off it.

34
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:14,174
She thinks water's
so goddamn special.

35
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:16,510
Well, you fell in love
with that flower child.

36
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:20,347
Hey, just be grateful that
she's okay and that Dana's okay.

37
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:22,599
Whatever happens
is in God's hands.

38
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,269
Oh, this is for you and Patty.

39
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,813
Thanks, brother. Thank
you for everything.

40
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,300
It's not useless, sweetheart.
You're going to use it someday.

41
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,405
Hey, Doc. How is she?

42
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,243
Oh.

43
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,828
-Hi.
-Be careful.

44
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,538
We need to do some
further tests,

45
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:47,499
but she's showing signs
of early onset OI.

46
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,792
There.

47
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:50,252
OI?

48
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,962
What does that mean?

49
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:54,214
We'll talk more, but
she's very fragile

50
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:56,341
and likely always will be.

51
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,551
Can I hold her?

52
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:58,762
Just be extra gentle.

53
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:02,515
Hold her head.

54
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:06,602
Yeah, you got her. There
you go. There you go.

55
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,353
You're going to have
to help take care of

56
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,189
your little sister, okay?

57
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,774
She's going to need you.

58
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:13,817
- Is something wrong with her?
- - No.

59
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,820
Hon, she's perfect.

60
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,531
She's very special.

61
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,519
{\an8}All right, we don't
got a lot of time.

62
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,229
{\an8}We gotta flush the stash.

63
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,690
{\an8}Whoa? Throw Tommy
in the river?

64
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,567
{\an8}Not literally, numb-nuts.

65
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,528
{\an8}Now that the cops got McCray,

66
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:58,737
{\an8}it's only a matter of time
before they find this place

67
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,031
{\an8}and everything we
worked for, up in smoke.

68
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:03,492
{\an8}But we got a moment
right now, today,

69
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,577
{\an8}to finally put some
respect on the Check name.

70
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,163
{\an8}What do we gotta do?

71
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:11,375
{\an8}We move the supply.
Today. Right now.

72
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,335
{\an8}Get them over the
border, out of Wausau.

73
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,546
{\an8}We set up out east working
for the boss himself.

74
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:17,756
{\an8}We need to accelerate
expansion plans.

75
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,383
{\an8}We need another one.

76
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,010
{\an8}A female.

77
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:23,554
{\an8}Jesus H. Christ,
man. From where?

78
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:25,931
{\an8}How the hell we gonna get past
the border without McCray?

79
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,600
{\an8}We're just gonna bulldoze it
with some reviver chick in tow?

80
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,228
{\an8}No. No, no, no.

81
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,312
{\an8}This is why I got the
brains in the family.

82
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,274
{\an8}You listen to your
older brother.

83
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:36,526
{\an8}We're going to kill two
birdies with one stone.

84
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:48,537
{\an8}Oh! Oh, I'm sorry.

85
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:51,373
{\an8}What the hell's wrong with you
sneaking up on me like that?

86
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:54,294
{\an8}Didn't mean to scare you.
I just, you got a visitor.

87
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,879
{\an8}What the hell?

88
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,466
{\an8}What's wrong with you? What
if she's my actual killer?

89
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,384
{\an8}You're not dead.

90
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,105
{\an8}Starting to wish I was
now that you're here.

91
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,432
{\an8}Wait. Are these my
Blackdeer files?

92
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,852
{\an8}Did you steal police property?
You trying to get arrested?

93
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,022
{\an8}That's all I have. And
I'll be quick, okay?

94
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,902
{\an8}Do you mind just
giving us some privacy?

95
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,362
{\an8}Oh, yeah. Excuse me. Yeah.

96
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:23,405
{\an8}-No! Brent!
-Yeah?

97
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,949
{\an8}Stay. I don't trust
her. You kidding?

98
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,285
{\an8}Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I'll stay.

99
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,413
{\an8}How did you get these?

100
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,664
{\an8}What's important
is what's in them.

101
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:36,002
{\an8}I know what's in them.
They're my files.

102
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,929
What is happening?

103
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,432
I think the reason
that you were shot is

104
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,685
because you were getting
too close to the truth

105
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:54,978
about Jesse and about...

106
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,855
I think

107
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,565
you're getting too
close to my face

108
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,651
and it's making me
deeply uncomfortable.

109
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:02,528
Dana, this is all tied
together. You being shot.

110
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,822
Aaron. The Blackdeer case.

111
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:07,074
You think McCray had something
to do with the Blackdeer case?

112
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,703
No, I don't think he shot
you. I think he was set up.

113
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:14,039
There it is! She
thinks he was set up!

114
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,458
-Oh.
-There it is.

115
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,502
Corruption on the police
force, tonight at seven.

116
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:19,795
Extra, extra!

117
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,588
The rot goes right to the...

118
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,090
The core of the...

119
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,883
Am I the corrupt cop?

120
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,052
-Uh-oh.
-Maybe I shot myself,

121
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,846
and then Aaron.

122
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:31,598
And then I pinned it
on another corrupt cop.

123
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,642
Oh, bang, bang.

124
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,477
Hard to wrap your head
around why'd you do that.

125
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,646
To cover up for
the Blackdeer case

126
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,189
everyone thinks I
botched two years ago

127
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,899
because I want
everybody off my back!

128
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,609
I just want you to
look at one thing.

129
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,944
No!

130
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,488
Get out of here!

131
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,074
-Okay.
-Yeah, she wants you...

132
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,995
so I think you've
overstayed, even.

133
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,833
My notes are in those files.

134
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:00,127
Just read them. Please.

135
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,712
Okay. Let's...

136
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:03,006
No touching.

137
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,162
There you are.

138
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,169
Oh, we got a good
group going here.

139
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,963
Roses, of course.
-Mm-hm.

140
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:28,632
Classic. But then... boom!

141
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:33,137
Lilies, all pink and yellow
like a sunset just exploded.

142
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:35,305
And then we've got
some snapdragons,

143
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,725
those funky ones that look
like little mouths, right?

144
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:40,018
Oh, and we can't
forget the daisies.

145
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,354
No, don't forget the daisies.

146
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,273
Oh, wait. Do you have any
enhanced mineral flower food?

147
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:47,027
Do we have any mineral
enhanced flower food?

148
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,278
No, we have none.

149
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,197
Oh! Now, Dana, what
in heavens' name

150
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,658
are you doing with
these other flowers?

151
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,702
They'll wilt, just
like our bodies,

152
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,287
if you don't take care of them.
-You now what?

153
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,205
You should go and
get some immediately

154
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,791
so that nothing wilts.

155
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,127
Yes. Right on it.

156
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,214
Lester.

157
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:12,926
No. No! No!

158
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,095
What the hell is
wrong with you people?

159
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:18,891
You all need to stop bringing
in candy and doughnuts!

160
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:22,102
She's been shot in the
stomach for Christ's sakes.

161
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,729
Sorry.

162
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,815
I'm retiring after this.

163
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,234
Wow. I tried.

164
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,028
-Thank you.
-Uh,

165
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,697
got the stuff you asked for.

166
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,032
How you holding up?

167
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,492
I've been better, but
then they come around

168
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:39,036
with the 'pterodactyl'
shots and I feel

169
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:41,915
great. I feel pretty good.

170
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:47,211
What's up with you?

171
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:49,756
I, uh, well, you know. Hm.

172
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,176
Seeing you like
this, it's, uh...

173
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,262
You know, it's...

174
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:00,100
especially, guy was
on my watch, you know?

175
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,311
I mean, you never liked McCray.

176
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,066
And now JP tells me he's
likely working with the Checks.

177
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,443
How'd I not see that?

178
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:12,361
Don't worry about
it. I don't think

179
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:14,196
the Checks are a part of this.

180
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,073
I mean, you know those assholes.

181
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,741
If they wanted me dead
they'd knock on my door

182
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,368
and shoot me in the face.

183
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,537
What about the professor?

184
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,956
How's he fit into all
this? He was texting you?

185
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,083
Yeah. I think he had
something to confess

186
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:28,252
and I just got there too late.

187
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:29,837
Wrong place, wrong time.

188
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:32,005
Confess what?

189
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:37,219
Um, oh, I'm not sure, but I
fired back at the shooter.

190
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,014
I got him in the right arm.

191
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:41,224
Did McCray have a wound there?

192
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,226
No.

193
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,688
Well, then, it's not him.
He must have been framed.

194
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:50,024
Well, when we got that
idiot at the checkpoint

195
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:52,192
he had a trunk full
of reviver parts.

196
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,403
Ugh, Jesus.

197
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:57,073
Well, he may be an idiot, but
he's an opportunistic one.

198
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,910
Hell, if I was going to
frame someone it'd be him.

199
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:04,664
You were right to
want out of here.

200
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,958
Town's been holding you back.

201
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:09,169
What? Dad.

202
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:12,672
When this is over
and you're, uh,

203
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,215
feeling better, huh?

204
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:18,218
You want a letter of
recommendation, you got it.

205
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,304
Anything!

206
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:21,847
Anything you need, I'm not
going to hold you back.

207
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,266
Okay?

208
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,278
I know. I'll take care of it.

209
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,947
Okay? Just...

210
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,283
I bet you I can figure it out.

211
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,618
I'm not the one who's yelling!

212
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,203
You're the one
who's yelling at me!

213
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:47,707
You're... Oh, nice. Nice.

214
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,001
Bunch of fricking
totally mean...

215
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:52,420
But... Ow!

216
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:01,971
Yes!

217
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:06,017
Oh, yeah.

218
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,230
-Oh, no!
-Oh my God.

219
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,482
Maybe I'll actually
beat you this time.

220
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,025
Thank you.

221
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:17,069
Ooh.

222
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,947
Okay, go.

223
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,952
Seven. One, two,
three, four, five.

224
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,639
I didn't shoot Dana.

225
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,760
And I sure as shit didn't
shoot that yuppie professor.

226
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,893
I'm a patsy.

227
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,603
What about those reviver
parts in the trunk?

228
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,981
You innocent of that, too?
Where did those come from?

229
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:55,858
No, no, no, no, no.

230
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:58,110
I took a criminal justice
class at night school.

231
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,195
I know my rights.

232
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,698
And if some undead freak
wants to sell his body parts

233
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:05,201
to make a buck around
town to some rich freak,

234
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,872
it's all more the good on them.

235
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:12,167
I am but a meagre middleman.

236
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,669
Transport. Nothing more.

237
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:17,588
Who paid you to move them?

238
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:19,506
You don't pay me
enough to answer that.

239
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,175
I made more last week

240
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:22,927
than I did all goddamn
last year with you.

241
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,513
I quit!

242
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,601
Gonna go find me a Lambo.

243
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,940
It's not him.

244
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:39,527
Anything new on the reviver
parts from his trunk?

245
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:44,366
Well, no match on the DNA,
but it's someone young.

246
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,451
In their 20s, they think.

247
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:49,078
Yeah.

248
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,955
Not a lot of young
revivers that I'm aware of.

249
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,707
There's one. Well...

250
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,418
you should see something.

251
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:08,556
I'm so out of touch
with this generation.

252
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:11,393
I know that kid.

253
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,728
He's dating Martha.

254
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:19,943
<i><font face="proportionalSansSerif" color="white">Mr. Cypress.</i>

255
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:23,237
Please, come on, man.
Hey, listen, Mr. Cypress,

256
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:25,489
I really don't know anything
about any reviver parts.

257
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,117
-Shut up.
-I swear to...

258
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:32,080
What is this place?

259
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,168
Welcome to Riverside.

260
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,007
Are you sure?

261
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:45,175
-Yes!
-Okay.

262
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:47,052
Get out of here!

263
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:49,681
Can't you see I don't
want them anymore?!

264
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:52,183
Take them back where
they came from!

265
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:56,520
Go!

266
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:58,772
You hurt yourself.
You were joking?

267
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:01,026
It was the ending from
Harry and the Hendersons.

268
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,778
John Lithgow has to
be super mean to Harry

269
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:06,697
'cause he wants to
get him to leave,

270
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:08,258
but he really doesn't
want him to leave.

271
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:10,534
I've never seen that.

272
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:11,744
It's funny 'cause I'm
saying it about doughnuts,

273
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,455
but he was saying
it about Harry.

274
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:15,372
It's okay.

275
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:17,541
Okay. I'll see...

276
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,501
-Hey.
-Yeah?

277
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:21,379
Can you do me a solid
and swing by my house?

278
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:24,173
Sure. Yeah. Why?

279
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:25,633
Just check on Em and Cooper.

280
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,260
I tried calling.

281
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,013
I'm sure they're just
playing video games, but...

282
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,472
Okay. Got it.

283
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:32,681
Thank you.

284
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,767
Take the doughnuts. All right?

285
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:37,728
-You should watch that movie.
-All right, I will.

286
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:40,357
I busted a stitch to
try to do that for you.

287
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:42,399
All right. See you.

288
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,069
-Okay.
-Okay.

289
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,821
Hey! Let me out!

290
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:51,075
Wait! You can't do this!

291
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:52,785
Hey!

292
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:54,412
What the hell is going on?

293
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,332
You can't keep me here!

294
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:06,424
Shit!

295
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:09,260
<i><font face="proportionalSansSerif" color="white">Ain't nothing you can do.</i>

296

00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,728
Hey. What...

298
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:22,232
Could you... What's
going on here? Wh-wh...

299
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:25,067
I'm Rhodey. What's your name?

00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,283

<i>You think that matters?</i>

304
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:38,747
I served my time. I
paid my debt to society.

305
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:40,875
Look where it got me, Rhodey.

306

Hold on, hold on. It's, uh...

320
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:52,447
There's something on the wall.

321
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:54,824
What?

322
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:57,535
There's a...

323
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:01,456
there's a comic on the wall
with a knife through it.

324

<i>It's, uh...</i>

325
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:06,835

It says Hack/Slash.

327
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:12,508

Do you need a hand?

347
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:34,883
The way you shivered when I
put that knife to his throat.

348
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:38,719
You have nothing to worry
about. He's not going anywhere.

349
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,221
He's only here to keep
you Cypresses in line.

350
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:42,974
I'm not a savage.

351
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:47,604
Although that
little reviver girl?

352
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:49,898
Yeah, she's what they
call collateral damage.

353
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,945
All right. Let's get a move on.

354
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:58,823
Get her cleaned up
and presentable.

355
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,912
You're going to be
the pretty little face

356
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:07,207
of our boss's new franchise.

357
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:15,173
Pull the trucks around.

358
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,181
Oh, oh. You're okay. Relax.

359
00:20:24,182 --> 00:20:26,767
-The Checks, they took them.
-No, we know.

360
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:29,019
Ibrahim told us.

361
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,188
Dana, why would they
be coming for you?

362
00:20:31,189 --> 00:20:33,857
I don't know. I mean,
we crossed paths, but...

363
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:35,986
...we made a deal.

364
00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:38,779
You made a deal with
the Check Brothers?

365
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,699
Anthony, actually.

366
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,200
-Oh.
-Shit.

367
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:44,869
Dana.

368
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:49,456
Well, that's just super.

369
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:51,291
What the devil happened?

370
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:54,086
Wait. Where's my
dad? Does he know?

371
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:56,296
Where's the hideout, McCray?

372
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:57,881
Huh?

373
00:20:57,882 --> 00:21:00,217
Okay, I... You
don't understand.

374
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:02,886
No! You don't understand.

375
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:05,724
Where is my daughter
and my grandson?

376
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:08,058
What?! Your family?

377
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:10,228
I have no idea what
you're talking about, man.

378
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:12,813
Ah!

379
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:15,149
No?

380
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,525
What are you going to do?
Shoot me in your own station?

381
00:21:16,526 --> 00:21:19,069
-I don't know! Let's find out.
-Ah!

382
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,071
Where would they keep them?
-Okay, okay, okay.

383
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:22,740
I know I've done a lot
of bad shit in my life,

384
00:21:22,741 --> 00:21:24,742
but I never laid a
hand on Dana! Okay?

385
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:26,827
Or your other daughter
or your grandson.

386
00:21:26,828 --> 00:21:28,287
I swear on my pappie's life.

387
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:30,456
And if it's about the brothers,

388
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:32,625
then I don't want
anything to do with that.

389
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,836
Why are you so
afraid of the Checks?

390
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:38,339
It's not them I'm afraid
of! It's who they work for.

391
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:42,176
-Who do they work for?
-Oh, come on, man!

392
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:44,178
You might as well just
kill me now! Okay?

393
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:46,305
Because they're going
to go after my family

394
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:48,307
and my dog, Newman, and that's
what they're going to do

395
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:50,225
if I help you out. So, go
ahead, just kill me now.

396
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:52,937
I'm sorry about your family,
but I gotta protect mine.
