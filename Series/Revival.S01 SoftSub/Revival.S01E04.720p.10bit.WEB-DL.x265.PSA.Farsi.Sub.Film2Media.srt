the town.

345
00:16:57,451 --> 00:16:58,920
I have to keep everyone safe.

346
00:16:58,953 --> 00:17:00,622
-Safe from me?

-[Wayne inhales deeply

348
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:06,293
All I'm asking
is for you to be a friend.

349
00:17:06,995 --> 00:17:09,797
Just like I was to you
when you lost Patty.

350
00:17:10,464 --> 00:17:12,000
-(whisper) That's not fair,
Diane.

351
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:13,968
-We stepped up for you, Wayne.

352
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:17,471
We looked after your girls
and your house!

353
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:20,642
Don't act like Ken didn't look
the other way during that time.

354
00:17:20,775 --> 00:17:23,978
And we did it happily
because you needed help.

355
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:27,815
I need help now, Wayne.

-I'm sorry.

359
00:17:48,335 --> 00:17:50,004
Oh my God.

360
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:06,420
So, what would you like
to accomplish

361
00:18:07,021 --> 00:18:08,690
in our sessions together?

362
00:18:10,825 --> 00:18:13,027
Is there anything
that you feel like discussing?

363
00:18:15,997 --> 00:18:19,166
Honestly, Martha, I'm not about
forcing a dialogue.

364
00:18:19,701 --> 00:18:21,401
If you want to leave,
I'll sign your court forms

365
00:18:21,536 --> 00:18:23,037
and I won't stop you.

366
00:18:27,675 --> 00:18:29,176
How do you think
being a reviver

367
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:30,745
has impacted your emotions?

368
00:18:34,582 --> 00:18:38,920
Aaron-- Dr. Weimar--
is my husband and he told me.

369
00:18:40,054 --> 00:18:41,889
Your secret is safe with me.

370
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:46,060
He just wanted to help.

374

-It does.

375
00:18:58,606 --> 00:19:01,075
I have other clients
who are also revivers.

376
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:04,579
But Martha, I also think that
you could use some help.

377
00:19:04,712 --> 00:19:08,583
Perhaps your recent
violent outburst

378
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:11,251
is tied to the fact that you

379
00:19:11,753 --> 00:19:15,590
went through the greatest trauma
anyone can experience.

380
00:19:16,057 --> 00:19:17,592
You died.

381
00:19:17,725 --> 00:19:19,292
Now do you remember
what happened

382
00:19:19,426 --> 00:19:20,962
the night of Revival Day?

383
00:19:21,428 --> 00:19:26,801
-Bits and pieces. I was high.
I was high a lot back then.

384
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,772
-People in pain self-medicate.

385
00:19:32,406 --> 00:19:33,975
Were you self-medicating?

386
00:19:35,743 --> 00:19:37,578
-I guess
you could call it that.

387
00:19:39,147 --> 00:19:40,581
I lost my mom.

been my fault
and I-I got hurt and I...

-[trembling inhale]

392
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,595
I went there that night...

393
00:19:55,963 --> 00:19:58,265
on her birthday and I just,
I had to get high

394
00:19:58,298 --> 00:19:59,801
to get through it.

395
00:19:59,934 --> 00:20:02,637
-And what were you doing
that you needed to be high for?

396
00:20:03,971 --> 00:20:05,640
-I don't know.

397
00:20:06,674 --> 00:20:08,609
Saying goodbye?

398
00:20:10,444 --> 00:20:12,312
-You were in a
very vulnerable place.

399
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:15,950
I'm sure that there were
a lot of choices

400
00:20:15,983 --> 00:20:17,652
that felt logical
in that moment--

401
00:20:17,785 --> 00:20:19,520
-Yeah, I know.
My sister thinks I...

402
00:20:20,054 --> 00:20:24,158
killed myself or OD'd,
but I don't...

403
00:20:26,293 --> 00:20:27,662
I don't know. I'm really...

404
00:20:27,829 --> 00:20:29,630
starting to think that
someone hurt me.

405
00:20:29,664 --> 00:20:32,299
-So your sister knows that
you're a reviver?

406
00:20:34,202 --> 00:20:35,670
Who else knows?

407
00:20:35,837 --> 00:20:37,337
With these new mandates
you need to be--

408
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,506
-No, I know.

409
00:20:38,673 --> 00:20:40,208
It's a secret and I'd--
-[sniffles]

410
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,211
really like to keep it that way.
My dad doesn't even know.

411
00:20:43,845 --> 00:20:45,880
-Well, that sounds like
something.

412
00:20:47,148 --> 00:20:48,683
Why not tell your dad?

413
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:51,886
-I think...

414
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:53,554
After losing my mom

415
00:20:53,721 --> 00:20:55,022
I just don't know if
he could handle it.

416
00:20:55,189 --> 00:20:57,992
Besides, you've seen how
he's reacted to the whole town

417
00:20:58,025 --> 00:20:59,861
and he's always seen me
as fragile

418
00:21:00,027 --> 00:21:03,231
and I don't know if
knowing I died

419
00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:05,066
would make that worse somehow.

420
00:21:05,867 --> 00:21:09,537
-Sorry, I just find it
surprising that anyone

421
00:21:09,704 --> 00:21:12,240
would see you as fragile.

422
00:21:14,709 --> 00:21:16,544
-To be fair,

423
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,680
I have a condition called O.I.

424
00:21:20,548 --> 00:21:23,217
Brittle bone disease,
so they always

425
00:21:23,383 --> 00:21:25,019
had to be careful with me.

426
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,355
-We do a lot
to protect our loved ones.

427
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:32,059
But I don't think that
we acknowledge enough

428
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,896
that it hurts when an illness

429
00:21:35,062 --> 00:21:37,064
changes our relationship
with them.

430
00:21:38,266 --> 00:21:39,901
How they see us as weak,

a lens of love.
