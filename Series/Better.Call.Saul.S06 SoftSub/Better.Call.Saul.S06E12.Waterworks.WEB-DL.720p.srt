they didn't have Duke's,
and I really like Duke's.

53
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:45,225
But they didn't have it,
which is a bummer. So...

I dunno.

actually mayonnaise, but...

Yeah,

Ah, the red ones could
maybe pass for garnet.

72

But the "gold" ones
are just regular yellow.

I said, "FSU!"

[scoffs] June, did you
ever even hear of that?

No! Sounds expensive.

77
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:45,829
And if they even
make such a thing,

78
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:47,030
you'd probably get flipper-hands

79
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:48,614

Where's his body?

362
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:12,632
I don't know.

363

[inhales sharply]

364
00:22:16,302 --> 00:22:17,637
And the police?

365
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,406
Will they search again?

366
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:20,539
They'll search.

367
00:22:24,811 --> 00:22:26,779
I don't think they'll find him.

368
00:22:26,913 --> 00:22:27,947

369
00:22:31,918 --> 00:22:32,985
Cheryl, he...

370
00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:38,357
It... it all happened
in an instant.

371
00:22:38,491 --> 00:22:40,693
And he didn't...
He didn't suffer.

372
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,668
"He didn't suffer."

373
00:22:52,472 --> 00:22:53,873
The lies you two made up.

374
00:22:54,841 --> 00:22:56,476
The picture you painted.

375
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:01,113
That's all he is now.

376
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:04,016
That's all anybody remembers.

377
00:23:07,353 --> 00:23:09,321
I want to change that.

378
00:23:09,456 --> 00:23:11,190
What happens now?

379
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:13,325
Will you be tried?

380
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,527
Will you go to jail?

381
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:17,062
I don't know.

382
00:23:18,698 --> 00:23:20,399

[chuckling] You're a... A
great one, Howard said!

384
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:25,438
How could you not know?

385
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:32,812
Bernalillo County
has my affidavit.

386
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:35,065
It's up to the district
attorney whether to prosecute.

387
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:38,950
And she may not.

388
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,320
Why?

389
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,859
There's no physical evidence.

No remaining witnesses
other than my ex-husband,

392
00:23:56,335 --> 00:23:57,770
I could sue you in civil court.

393
00:23:57,904 --> 00:23:59,264
I could take
everything you've got.

394
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:05,210

Hey, I gotta tell you, I
think you're gonna regret

not taking your share

I told him he could go to Hell

546
00:43:11,356 --> 00:43:12,667
for stealing something
like that, I mean.

547
00:43:12,691 --> 00:43:14,025
But did he listen to me? No.

548
00:43:16,394 --> 00:43:20,198
But you, you got him
off, like, scot-free. That...

549
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:23,368
That was pretty slick, yo.

550
00:43:23,501 --> 00:43:26,772
Well, tell him I hope he's
keeping his nose clean.

551
00:43:26,905 --> 00:43:28,039
Yeah, yeah, right on.

552
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:30,540
Absolutely.

553
00:43:32,177 --> 00:43:33,611
Ah.

554
00:43:33,745 --> 00:43:36,114
Hey, so, you having all
this expertise and all...

555
00:43:37,716 --> 00:43:39,517
This guy Goodman?

556
00:43:40,585 --> 00:43:42,320
He the real deal?

557
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:43,621
Like, lawyer-wise?

558
00:43:43,755 --> 00:43:44,823
Why do you ask?

559
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,330
I got a buddy in there who's
facing some serious time.

560
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,766
I mean, not... you know,
not Baby Jesus-time,

561
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,402
but... but serious.

562
00:43:57,535 --> 00:44:00,038
You know, he needs
top-shelf legal representation.

563
00:44:00,171 --> 00:44:01,807
And I tell him that, right?

564
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:04,575
But, you know, he sees this
dude's commercials on TV

565
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:06,644
and this is where
he wants to go.

566
00:44:06,778 --> 00:44:11,116
And I tell him, "Yo, Emilio, you
know, a funny TV commercial

567
00:44:11,249 --> 00:44:14,085
is not a sound basis
for, like, you know..."

568
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:18,023
I mean, like, would you
go to doctor to do, like,

569
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:20,425
an operation on you in like a...

570
00:44:20,558 --> 00:44:22,160
On, like, your
spleen or whatever

571
00:44:23,729 --> 00:44:25,964
on the fact of a
funny TV commercial?

572
00:44:26,097 --> 00:44:27,498
No. I mean, come on.

573
00:44:27,632 --> 00:44:29,400
How is this any different?

574
00:44:29,534 --> 00:44:30,668
You know?

575
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:36,140
Anyway...

576
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:40,578
Is this guy any good?

577
00:44:49,921 --> 00:44:51,356

Jeff? What time is it?

598
00:47:20,271 --> 00:47:21,873
Are you okay?

599
00:47:22,007 --> 00:47:24,275
Yeah, no, not really.

600
00:47:24,409 --> 00:47:26,377
Um, I, uh...

601
00:47:26,511 --> 00:47:28,213
Dad, I got arrested.

00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:29,480
<i>Oh, no.</i>

603
00:47:29,614 --> 00:47:31,516
What for? Jeffie.

604
00:47:31,649 --> 00:47:33,451
<i>It's like this crazy
mistake, you know?</i>

605
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:35,320
<i>I mean, I had an accident, okay?</i>

606
00:47:35,453 --> 00:47:38,456
<i>A, a little fender-bender

608
00:47:40,959 --> 00:47:43,995
or maybe it was a
defective... I dunno.

609
00:47:44,129 --> 00:47:46,097
But that's not
the big-deal part.

610
00:47:46,998 --> 00:47:49,400
The big-deal part is,

611
00:47:49,534 --> 00:47:54,405
they think that I, me,
committed a robbery.

612
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:56,241
<i>And why would they think that?</i>

613
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:58,076
I know, right?

had the accident?</i>

<i>He comes wandering
out of his house</i>

the, the police, and says,</i>

"Hey, you know, I got robbed!"

619
00:48:08,153 --> 00:48:10,121
And sure enough, the police?

620
00:48:10,255 --> 00:48:14,625
They find evidence of,
like, breaking and entering.

621
00:48:14,759 --> 00:48:18,329
And, and, and stuff is
missing, which I did not do.

622
00:48:19,664 --> 00:48:23,368
And, uh... yeah. Like that.

623
00:48:23,501 --> 00:48:26,537
Well, the police are obviously
barking up the wrong tree.

624
00:48:26,671 --> 00:48:28,206
Yeah. No shit, wrong tree!

625
00:48:28,339 --> 00:48:31,176
- Wrong, like, forest.
<i>- Exactly.</i>

626
00:48:31,309 --> 00:48:33,511
<i>Because you would never
do something like that,</i>

627
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:34,645
<i>would you, son?</i>

628
00:48:34,779 --> 00:48:37,348
No. No. No way,
man. Absolutely not.

629
00:48:37,482 --> 00:48:39,484
<i>Uh, when the police
took you into custody,</i>

630
00:48:39,617 --> 00:48:42,520
<i>did they find any of this
so-called stolen merchandise?</i>

631
00:48:42,653 --> 00:48:44,089
<i>Was it in your possession?</i>

632
00:48:44,222 --> 00:48:45,890
- No. <i>- Of course it wasn't.</i>

633
00:48:46,024 --> 00:48:48,226
Because you
didn't steal anything.

634
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:52,097
Therefore, since there's no evidence
whatsoever that you committed any crime,

635
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:53,750
I'd say you got
nothing to worry about.

636
00:48:54,865 --> 00:48:56,301
<i>So, what happens next?</i>

637
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:58,136
Breathe deep and sit tight.

638
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:00,038
I'll have you out by lunchtime.

640
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,875
Nah, I think it'll be your mom.

641
00:49:06,211 --> 00:49:07,345
You'll talk to her for me?

642
00:49:07,478 --> 00:49:08,679
<i>I sure will.</i>

643
00:49:08,813 --> 00:49:10,381

out, no problem.</i>

Gene.

656

Gene, Honey, do you
know what time it is?

657
00:49:55,626 --> 00:49:58,296
Oh. Oh, God. That boy.

658
00:49:58,429 --> 00:50:00,198
He's gonna put me in my grave.

00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:02,033
Marion. [chuckles]

660
00:50:02,167 --> 00:50:03,634

something you didn't do?

00:50:05,103 --> 00:50:06,637

<i>This isn't the first
time, you know.</i>

Oh, Jesus.

- The death of me.

Marion. Marion, it's
gonna be all right.

Well, money's not

'cause I'm gonna
help you with that.

682
00:50:50,915 --> 00:50:53,118
No. Gene, I can't
let you do that. No.

683
00:50:53,251 --> 00:50:55,886
<i>Sure you can.
Jeff'll pay me back.</i>

684
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:58,100
And you don't have to worry
about a bondsman, either.

685
00:50:58,156 --> 00:50:59,324
Because guess what?

686
00:50:59,457 --> 00:51:01,692
In Omaha, they don't have 'em.

687
00:51:01,826 --> 00:51:03,370
All right? You just
walk into the station

688
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:04,674
and you pay a
straight cash bail.

689
00:51:04,729 --> 00:51:06,497
It's not like
Albuquerque at all.

690
00:51:11,769 --> 00:51:14,004

691
00:51:14,139 --> 00:51:15,840
Yeah. Why...

692
00:51:15,973 --> 00:51:19,510
[hesitating] Why did Jeff
call you instead of me?

693
00:51:19,644 --> 00:51:22,513
Well, I think he was
scared at how you'd take it.

694
00:51:22,647 --> 00:51:24,715
Honestly, I was gonna
pay the bail myself,

695
00:51:24,849 --> 00:51:26,427
but I think it should
be a family member.

696
00:51:26,451 --> 00:51:28,419
I think that'd be best.

thing squared away.</i>
