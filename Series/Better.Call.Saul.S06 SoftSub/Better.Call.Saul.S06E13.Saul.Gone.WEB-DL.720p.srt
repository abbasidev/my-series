1
00:00:19,236 --> 00:00:24,241
And now, the series finale
of "Better Call Saul."

2
00:00:27,766 --> 00:00:29,333
Previously on "Better Call Saul..."

3
00:00:29,464 --> 00:00:31,509
Thought you might want to know
I'm still alive.

4
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,163
You should turn yourself in.

5
00:00:33,294 --> 00:00:35,014
We're both too smart
to throw our lives away

6
00:00:35,078 --> 00:00:36,210
for no reason.

7
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,733
I'm glad you're alive.

8
00:00:39,256 --> 00:00:41,563
Bernalillo County
has my affidavit.

9
00:00:41,693 --> 00:00:45,001
There's no physical evidence...
No remaining witnesses

10
00:00:45,132 --> 00:00:47,003
other than my ex-husband.

11
00:00:47,134 --> 00:00:48,439
There's a criminal

12
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,224
standing in my kitchen,
threatening me.

13
00:00:50,354 --> 00:00:53,575
He's a wanted man
and his name is Saul Goodman.

14
00:02:02,818 --> 00:02:04,298
Slow down.

15
00:02:04,428 --> 00:02:06,648
You're gonna make yourself sick.

16
00:02:32,717 --> 00:02:34,545
You know...

17
00:02:34,676 --> 00:02:37,113
we're sitting on
seven million bucks here.

18
00:02:37,244 --> 00:02:39,376
Literally.

19
00:02:39,507 --> 00:02:40,856
And...?

20
00:02:44,381 --> 00:02:46,035
I say we take it,

21
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,299
split it fifty-fifty,

22
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,258
take off.

23
00:02:51,388 --> 00:02:52,868
It's not ours.

24
00:02:55,262 --> 00:02:56,872
Could be.

25
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,527
Yeah, well, I know some people

26
00:02:59,657 --> 00:03:02,051
who would have a problem
with that.

27
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,357
Them?

28
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,795
Don't worry about them.

29
00:03:11,887 --> 00:03:13,193
You feeling right?

30
00:03:18,807 --> 00:03:20,896
First thing we do,

31
00:03:21,026 --> 00:03:23,681
take six million bucks
and build a time machine.

32
00:03:25,074 --> 00:03:27,729
Those people that
you're worried about?

33
00:03:27,859 --> 00:03:29,513
They'll never find us.

34
00:03:32,951 --> 00:03:35,258
Where would you go first, huh?

35
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:38,522
You... You look like a
history buff, right? Hm.

36
00:03:38,653 --> 00:03:41,308
What, would you go
to Civil War times or...

37
00:03:42,831 --> 00:03:44,224
um, Ancient Rome?

38
00:03:44,354 --> 00:03:46,138
Oh, Christ.

39
00:03:48,619 --> 00:03:50,578
Mm. Hmm.

40
00:03:54,973 --> 00:03:57,237
December 8, 2001.

41
00:03:58,977 --> 00:04:00,196
Why?

42
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,112
No. No.

43
00:04:06,942 --> 00:04:09,597
March 17, 1984.

44
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,691
Day I took my first bribe.

45
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,613
And then I'd go forward.

46
00:04:27,876 --> 00:04:31,619
There's some people I'd like to
check on in five or ten years,

47
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:33,621
make sure they're doing okay.

48
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,802
You?

49
00:04:42,064 --> 00:04:44,936
It's easy.

50
00:04:45,067 --> 00:04:47,635
May 10, 1965.

51
00:04:52,161 --> 00:04:55,904
That's the day Warren Buffett
took over at Berkshire Hathaway.

52
00:04:57,645 --> 00:05:01,431
I figure, got a million left
from building the time machine,

53
00:05:01,562 --> 00:05:06,567
so I'd take my half and
just stick it into Berkshire.

54
00:05:06,697 --> 00:05:10,397
Then I'd come back here and...

55
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,921
I'm a billionaire.

56
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,753
Ohh.

57
00:05:18,883 --> 00:05:21,016
Is there such a thing
as a trillionaire?

58
00:05:23,061 --> 00:05:24,846
That's it. Money?

59
00:05:27,196 --> 00:05:28,806
What else?

60
00:05:28,937 --> 00:05:30,504
Nothing you'd change?

61
00:05:40,905 --> 00:05:42,342
I'm rested.

62
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:24,098
Marion?
Are you still there?

63
00:06:24,122 --> 00:06:27,169
Yes! It's a...
It's a little car. Beige.

64
00:06:27,299 --> 00:06:29,911
I... I... I don't know the make.

65
00:06:33,436 --> 00:06:35,090
Sixty-four, P...

66
00:06:38,267 --> 00:06:39,921
F. T. Six.

67
00:06:40,051 --> 00:06:42,576
He's headed south,
towards Curtis.

68
00:06:44,142 --> 00:06:46,318
Oh, please get him.

69
00:06:53,456 --> 00:06:54,979
Omaha cop on scanner:
12-14 responding.

70
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:58,853
On that ten twenty-nine
V as in Victor.

71
00:06:58,983 --> 00:07:01,246
That's a Saturn Aura? Omaha dispatch:
That is correct.

72
00:07:01,377 --> 00:07:06,121
Saturn Aura, Nebraska
six four Paul Frank Tom six.

73
00:07:10,517 --> 00:07:14,216
White male, late 40s,
about 5'11", 180 pounds.

74
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:02,819
"Hoover Max Extract
Pressure-Pro, model sixty."

75
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:08,651
Hoover Pressure-Pro
Max Extract, model sixty.

76
00:10:30,542 --> 00:10:32,980
Ohh!

77
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,657
Anybody home?

78
00:11:03,445 --> 00:11:05,099
Hands. Now.

79
00:11:25,249 --> 00:11:27,991
I was at a party,
just minding my own business.

80
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,516
You are under arrest.

81
00:11:31,647 --> 00:11:33,301
I better call Saul!

82
00:11:34,737 --> 00:11:35,999
Hi. I'm Saul Goodman.

83
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,958
Did you know
that you have rights?

84
00:11:38,088 --> 00:11:40,656
The Constitution says you do,
and so do I.

85
00:11:40,787 --> 00:11:42,702
I believe that,
until proven guilty,

86
00:11:42,832 --> 00:11:45,922
every man, woman, and child
in this country is innocent.

87
00:11:46,053 --> 00:11:48,577
And that's why I fight for you,
Albuquerque! Better Call...

88
00:12:08,162 --> 00:12:11,513
Hello, Krista? It's Gene.

89
00:12:11,643 --> 00:12:14,124
Uh, uh, sorry
I wasn't in this morning.

90
00:12:14,255 --> 00:12:17,388
Did you open up okay?

91
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,087
I'm fine...
C-Could you do me a favor?

92
00:12:22,567 --> 00:12:25,266
The week's rotation
needs to be posted by three.

93
00:12:25,396 --> 00:12:27,007
Could you handle that?

94
00:12:28,573 --> 00:12:31,402
Uh, one more thing. Um...

95
00:12:31,533 --> 00:12:32,969
Just call the main office.

96
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,971
The... The number
is on the bulletin board.

97
00:12:35,102 --> 00:12:37,757
And, uh, let them know, um...

98
00:12:40,411 --> 00:12:42,370
you're gonna need a new manager.

99
00:12:43,632 --> 00:12:45,547
Gene:
This is how they get you?

100
00:12:47,288 --> 00:12:49,116
This is how they get you?

101
00:12:50,247 --> 00:12:52,772
This is how they get you?

102
00:12:54,121 --> 00:12:56,123
This is how they get you?

103
00:12:57,864 --> 00:12:59,648
This is how they get you?

104
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:03,434
This is how they get you?

105
00:13:03,565 --> 00:13:05,480
Jesus.

106
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,395
What were you thinking?

107
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,400
What... were... you...

108
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:13,575
thinking?!

109
00:13:17,057 --> 00:13:18,580
Ow!

110
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,151
Shit!

111
00:14:02,754 --> 00:14:04,539
Ah! Ah! Hey!

112
00:14:04,669 --> 00:14:06,541
Ahh!

113
00:14:06,671 --> 00:14:09,109
I need another phone call!

114
00:14:09,239 --> 00:14:12,155
Another phone call!

115
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,215
William Oakley and Associates,

116
00:14:28,345 --> 00:14:30,391
"Trust experience,
trust Oakley."

117
00:14:30,521 --> 00:14:32,001
Bill Oakley speaking.

118
00:14:32,132 --> 00:14:34,003
"Trust experience,
trust Oakley."

119
00:14:34,134 --> 00:14:36,049
I like that.
It's catchy.

120
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:37,877
You know who this is, right?

121
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,664
Saul?

122
00:14:42,794 --> 00:14:44,971
You got it, buddy.

123
00:14:45,101 --> 00:14:47,061
Wh-Wh-Wh-What are you, uh...
What... What are y...

124
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:49,453
Uh, wha...
Uh, what are you doing?

125
00:14:49,584 --> 00:14:51,431
Uh, you know I'm gonna
have to report this call.

126
00:14:51,455 --> 00:14:53,283
Whoa.
Calm down, Junior.

127
00:14:53,414 --> 00:14:54,894
The cops know
all about the call.

128
00:14:55,024 --> 00:14:56,373
They're probably listening in.

129
00:14:56,504 --> 00:14:58,071
The fact is,
I'm standing in the middle

130
00:14:58,201 --> 00:15:01,944
of a police station as we speak.

131
00:15:02,075 --> 00:15:03,815
So they finally caught you.

132
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:05,600
Listen.
This is your lucky day.

133
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:09,778
I am talking to Saul Goodman's
new advisory counsel.

134
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,084
What?

135
00:15:11,214 --> 00:15:13,913
Keep up, Bill.
You hit the jackpot.

136
00:15:14,043 --> 00:15:15,194
"Advisory counsel...?"

137
00:15:15,218 --> 00:15:17,046
This puts you on the map, amigo.

138
00:15:17,177 --> 00:15:18,613
Here's what you're gonna do.

139
00:15:18,743 --> 00:15:21,442
You're gonna grab a flight
to Omaha, Nebraska, ASAP.

140
00:15:21,572 --> 00:15:22,878
There's nothing direct,

141
00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:24,725
so you're gonna have to
connect through Houston.

142
00:15:24,749 --> 00:15:26,490
Wh... Who's paying for this?

143
00:15:26,621 --> 00:15:28,710
You are. Listen.
You hear that?

144
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,494
Hear what? Bang, bang!

145
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,105
That's opportunity knocking.

146
00:15:32,235 --> 00:15:33,845
Get off your ass
and answer the door.

147
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:35,630
Okay, on your way
to the airport...

148
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,521
Wait. Wait. Hold on... I need you
to make some calls.

149
00:15:37,545 --> 00:15:39,112
Even supposing, hypothetically,

150
00:15:39,242 --> 00:15:40,852
I'd be willing
to take this on...

151
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:42,898
"Willing"?
Bill, this is a career-maker.

152
00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:44,334
Get real.
You're doing this.

153
00:15:44,465 --> 00:15:47,468
The DA has a warehouse
of evidence against you...

154
00:15:47,598 --> 00:15:50,297
I can't even begin to imagine
what the Feds are sitting on.

155
00:15:50,427 --> 00:15:54,127
No matter who your lawyer is,
you are screwed.

156
00:15:54,257 --> 00:15:55,824
So I've gotta ask...

157
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,826
Where do you see this ending?

158
00:16:00,568 --> 00:16:03,484
Where do I see it ending?
Um...

159
00:16:03,614 --> 00:16:06,400
With me on top.
Like always.

160
00:16:29,249 --> 00:16:30,511
RICO.

161
00:16:30,641 --> 00:16:32,208
Not five, not ten,

162
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:34,297
but twenty-seven
predicate violations.

163
00:16:34,428 --> 00:16:36,493
Federal conspiracy
to manufacture and distribute

164
00:16:36,517 --> 00:16:37,735
a controlled substance.

165
00:16:37,866 --> 00:16:40,434
On this scale?
Life sentence, stat max.

166
00:16:40,564 --> 00:16:41,696
Money laundering.

167
00:16:41,826 --> 00:16:43,263
Eight counts, twenty years each.

168
00:16:43,393 --> 00:16:46,135
One hundred sixty years,
stat max.

169
00:16:46,266 --> 00:16:48,485
We'll argue for
consecutive sentencing.

170
00:16:48,616 --> 00:16:51,140
Accessory after the fact
to multiple murders.

171
00:16:51,271 --> 00:16:54,317
Including two decorated
federal officers.

172
00:16:54,448 --> 00:16:56,580
Fifteen years each.

173
00:16:56,711 --> 00:16:58,713
By our count,
that's life plus...

174
00:16:58,843 --> 00:17:00,715
Braddock:
One hundred ninety.

175
00:17:00,845 --> 00:17:03,457
Life plus
one hundred ninety years.

176
00:17:05,154 --> 00:17:07,809
All right.
I'm willing to extend

177
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:10,246
a one-time,
take-it-or-leave-it offer.

178
00:17:10,377 --> 00:17:13,815
Here's the headline:
thirty years.

179
00:17:13,945 --> 00:17:16,339
Keep your nose clean,
stay healthy,

180
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,559
you have a shot at seeing
daylight in your old age.

181
00:17:22,954 --> 00:17:26,001
Mr. Oakley,
your "co-counsel,"

182
00:17:26,132 --> 00:17:27,785
is he here with us?

183
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:30,701
Uh, listen, you've got Agent
Schrader's widow back there.

184
00:17:30,832 --> 00:17:32,632
Why don't you
invite her in? Uh, wait a sec...

185
00:17:32,747 --> 00:17:34,246
I mean, you owe her that much,
don't you?

186
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,987
Well, no, she...
She can't be present at a...

187
00:17:36,011 --> 00:17:37,771
A plea negotiation.
It's completely inappropriate.

188
00:17:37,795 --> 00:17:39,145
She's already here.

189
00:17:39,275 --> 00:17:41,712
Both parties agree.
It's fine. Really.

190
00:18:23,276 --> 00:18:25,626
They tell me they found you
in a garbage dumpster.

191
00:18:28,368 --> 00:18:29,934
Well, that makes sense.

192
00:18:33,199 --> 00:18:35,723
My husband was the best man
that I have ever known.

193
00:18:37,464 --> 00:18:40,293
He lived to help others.

194
00:18:42,033 --> 00:18:44,949
If somebody was in trouble,
no matter the time,

195
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,779
no matter the place,
Hank Schrader would be there.

196
00:18:52,609 --> 00:18:54,220
With a smile and a joke.

197
00:18:57,571 --> 00:19:00,617
He was kind,

198
00:19:00,748 --> 00:19:03,054
he was decent,

199
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:04,665
he was strong.

200
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:11,498
His partner...

201
00:19:11,628 --> 00:19:12,977
Steve Gomez.

202
00:19:13,108 --> 00:19:15,806
Steve and Blanca

203
00:19:15,937 --> 00:19:19,158
made a home that was warm
and full of laughter.

204
00:19:20,681 --> 00:19:23,074
Three children.

205
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:27,992
Three fatherless children.

206
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:32,997
Hank and Steve...
the good guys.

207
00:19:34,782 --> 00:19:37,350
They were shot dead

208
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,526
and left in a hole
in the desert.

209
00:19:42,485 --> 00:19:44,792
And you.

210
00:19:44,922 --> 00:19:49,188
You helped the two-faced
poisonous bastard behind it all.

211
00:19:51,712 --> 00:19:53,670
For what?

212
00:19:53,801 --> 00:19:55,672
Money.

213
00:19:57,631 --> 00:20:00,808
You did it all for money.

214
00:20:03,071 --> 00:20:04,942
No matter
what they do with you now,

215
00:20:05,073 --> 00:20:07,249
no matter where they put you
or for how long,

216
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,470
it will never be enough.

217
00:20:19,696 --> 00:20:21,132
Mrs...

218
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:23,134
Mrs. Schrader.

219
00:20:25,093 --> 00:20:26,790
The loss that you've suffered...

220
00:20:26,921 --> 00:20:28,749
It's unspeakable.

221
00:20:33,754 --> 00:20:37,192
I met your husband a few times.

222
00:20:38,889 --> 00:20:40,587
He was a man
who stood by his word

223
00:20:40,717 --> 00:20:43,851
and was very good at his job.

224
00:20:43,981 --> 00:20:45,548
A straight shooter.

225
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,770
You and he are...

226
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,598
victims.

227
00:20:54,862 --> 00:20:56,385
And so am I.

228
00:21:01,782 --> 00:21:06,265
Two years ago
a man came into my office.

229
00:21:06,395 --> 00:21:09,398
He said his name was Mayhew.

230
00:21:09,529 --> 00:21:13,272
He wanted one of my clients
to lie under oath.

231
00:21:13,402 --> 00:21:15,578
He offered me money.

232
00:21:15,709 --> 00:21:17,145
I declined.

233
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,973
Any lawyer would.

234
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:24,979
That night, as I was leaving
my office, I was attacked.

235
00:21:26,633 --> 00:21:28,461
Two men threw a sack
over my head,

236
00:21:28,591 --> 00:21:32,203
they hogtied me, and they
drove me out into the desert.

237
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:34,423
And when they pulled
the hood off,

238
00:21:34,554 --> 00:21:38,645
I was kneeling
in front of an open grave.

239
00:21:38,775 --> 00:21:41,604
With a gun pointed at my head.

240
00:21:41,735 --> 00:21:44,303
That was myintroduction
to Walter White.

241
00:21:48,089 --> 00:21:51,005
From that moment on,

242
00:21:51,135 --> 00:21:53,877
there hasn't been a minute
that I wasn't afraid.

243
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:58,317
Yeah. I worked for him.
I made a lot of money.

244
00:21:58,447 --> 00:22:00,580
But that's not why I did it.

245
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:05,019
I did it because I knew what
he would do to me if I refused.

246
00:22:05,149 --> 00:22:07,978
Over and over, I thought
about going to the police.

247
00:22:08,109 --> 00:22:10,546
I even thought about
talking to Agent Schrader.

248
00:22:10,677 --> 00:22:15,290
But I knew that Walter White
would kill me, wherever I was.

249
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:18,772
And I was right.

250
00:22:18,902 --> 00:22:20,774
You look it up.

251
00:22:20,904 --> 00:22:23,559
October 4, 2009.

252
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:28,477
They murdered ten men
inside three prisons

253
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,523
in the space of two minutes.

254
00:22:30,653 --> 00:22:34,004
Knifed. Throats slashed.

255
00:22:34,135 --> 00:22:36,529
A man was burned alive.

256
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:39,923
They even killed
one of my colleagues, a lawyer.

257
00:22:40,054 --> 00:22:43,971
He was cooperating with the DEA.

258
00:22:44,101 --> 00:22:46,843
Daniel Wachsburger.

259
00:22:46,974 --> 00:22:52,545
The news said
Dan was stabbed 48 times.

260
00:22:54,721 --> 00:22:58,942
So, yeah, when it all blew up,
I ran.

261
00:22:59,073 --> 00:23:00,944
But not from the police.

262
00:23:01,075 --> 00:23:02,816
From them.

263
00:23:04,034 --> 00:23:06,080
Walter White might be dead,

264
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:08,082
but Jesse Pinkman
and the others?

265
00:23:08,212 --> 00:23:11,085
They're still out there,
somewhere.

266
00:23:14,088 --> 00:23:16,307
Mrs. Schrader...

267
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:19,789
you are looking at a man
who has lost everything.

268
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,445
My profession.
My family. My freedom.

269
00:23:23,576 --> 00:23:25,839
I have... I have nobody.

270
00:23:25,969 --> 00:23:27,536
I have nothing.

271
00:23:36,632 --> 00:23:39,243
And you think jurors
are gonna buy that?

272
00:23:42,986 --> 00:23:44,248
One.

273
00:23:46,512 --> 00:23:48,209
All I need is one.

274
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:56,870
Oakley tells me that
you've never lost a case.

275
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,393
Is that so?

276
00:23:59,786 --> 00:24:01,701
That's a hell of a record.

277
00:24:01,831 --> 00:24:03,311
You should be proud of that.

278
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,704
Still...

279
00:24:04,834 --> 00:24:07,402
Juries, right?

280
00:24:07,533 --> 00:24:09,665
Whew.
You never can tell.

281
00:24:09,796 --> 00:24:13,147
It's a roll of the dice.

282
00:24:13,277 --> 00:24:15,802
I'm just... I'm hoping
there's some wiggle room.

283
00:24:18,718 --> 00:24:21,285
You are not going to
negotiate with this man.

284
00:24:21,416 --> 00:24:22,635
You're not.

285
00:24:53,404 --> 00:24:55,276
Seventeen.

286
00:24:55,406 --> 00:24:57,080
After sentence has been imposed
on the counts

287
00:24:57,104 --> 00:25:01,064
to which defendant pleads guilty
as agreed herein,

288
00:25:01,195 --> 00:25:03,066
the government
will move to dismiss

289
00:25:03,197 --> 00:25:07,244
Counts Three through Nine
of the indictment.

290
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:08,811
Eighteen.

291
00:25:08,942 --> 00:25:11,248
Based on the facts
now known to the government,

292
00:25:11,379 --> 00:25:14,164
the anticipated offense level
is 35,

293
00:25:14,295 --> 00:25:15,775
which, when combined with

294
00:25:15,905 --> 00:25:19,169
the anticipated criminal history
category of I,

295
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,736
results in an anticipated

296
00:25:20,867 --> 00:25:23,260
advisory sentencing
guidelines range

297
00:25:23,391 --> 00:25:25,959
of 85 to 90 months imprisonment,

298
00:25:26,089 --> 00:25:28,614
in addition
to any supervised release,

299
00:25:28,744 --> 00:25:31,834
fine, and restitution
the Court may impose.

300
00:25:34,881 --> 00:25:36,535
Seven and a half years.

301
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,558
Let's get this thing
signed and get the hell out of here.

302
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:41,888
We're good with that.

303
00:25:42,018 --> 00:25:43,846
"Nineteen."

304
00:25:43,977 --> 00:25:48,851
Term to be served at
FCI Butner Low, North Carolina.

305
00:25:48,982 --> 00:25:50,549
"Wing D."

306
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:54,378
FCI Butner Low.

307
00:25:54,509 --> 00:25:58,165
It's a great location.
Very nice weather.

308
00:25:58,295 --> 00:26:01,124
It's the only federal
institution with a golf program.

309
00:26:01,255 --> 00:26:04,258
It was good enough
for Bernie Madoff...

310
00:26:04,388 --> 00:26:06,216
This is an actual request?

311
00:26:06,347 --> 00:26:07,740
Are you kidding?

312
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:09,350
I give you guys half a chance,

313
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,527
you're gonna throw me into
gen pop in some hellhole.

314
00:26:12,658 --> 00:26:16,357
I visited a client once
at ADX Montrose.

315
00:26:16,487 --> 00:26:18,794
"The Alcatraz
of the Rockies."

316
00:26:18,925 --> 00:26:21,449
No. No, that's a dealbreaker,
my friend.

317
00:26:30,676 --> 00:26:32,852
FCI Butner Low.
Wing...

318
00:26:32,982 --> 00:26:34,854
D. Wing D.

319
00:26:34,984 --> 00:26:37,204
"Wing D."

320
00:26:37,334 --> 00:26:39,598
And now we are done.

321
00:26:39,728 --> 00:26:43,340
Ah, as Steve Jobs used to say...
One more thing.

322
00:26:43,471 --> 00:26:44,951
"Twenty."

323
00:26:45,081 --> 00:26:47,954
During incarceration,
Defendant Goodman to receive

324
00:26:48,084 --> 00:26:51,000
one pint Blue Bell
mint chocolate chip ice cream

325
00:26:51,131 --> 00:26:52,698
"every Friday
for the duration."

326
00:26:52,828 --> 00:26:54,264
Are you kidding?

327
00:26:54,395 --> 00:26:55,788
He's kidding.

328
00:26:55,918 --> 00:26:57,354
"Blue Bell
Mint Chocolate Chip."

329
00:26:57,485 --> 00:26:58,878
No substitutions.

330
00:26:59,008 --> 00:27:00,662
Okay. That's it.

331
00:27:00,793 --> 00:27:03,186
Hold on.
I can oil everybody's locks.

332
00:27:03,317 --> 00:27:05,188
No more games.No. I got a sweetener.

333
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:07,016
It's nothing I've talked about.

334
00:27:07,147 --> 00:27:08,975
New arena. Primo stuff.

335
00:27:14,589 --> 00:27:16,460
Go.

336
00:27:16,591 --> 00:27:20,421
Inside story, previously unknown
felony homicide.

337
00:27:22,292 --> 00:27:24,991
It concerns a prominent
Albuquerque attorney

338
00:27:25,121 --> 00:27:29,212
who, uh, disappeared, believed
to have killed himself.

339
00:27:29,343 --> 00:27:30,823
Howard Hamlin?

340
00:27:30,953 --> 00:27:32,757
You're talking
about Howard Hamlin.

341
00:27:32,781 --> 00:27:35,305
That's your "sweetener"?

342
00:27:35,436 --> 00:27:38,526
He's trying to sell us
the Hamlin thing.

343
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:41,224
He thought
he really had something.

344
00:27:41,355 --> 00:27:42,704
Sounds like you and your ex

345
00:27:42,835 --> 00:27:45,141
aren't talking
on a regular basis.

346
00:27:45,272 --> 00:27:47,056
Kim Wexler walked into

347
00:27:47,187 --> 00:27:49,624
the Albuquerque DA's office
last month.

348
00:27:49,755 --> 00:27:53,584
She spilled her guts about
Howard Hamlin... on the record.

349
00:27:53,715 --> 00:27:56,500
You got nothing left to sell.

350
00:27:56,631 --> 00:27:58,241
Last chance.

351
00:27:58,372 --> 00:28:01,505
Do we go to trial,
or do we have a deal?

352
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:06,380
Yes!
Yes, we have a deal.

353
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:09,688
Let's get this
in writing. Not a word changes.

354
00:28:43,286 --> 00:28:44,723
Ugh. Of course.

355
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:02,479
Am I gonna be sorry
if I ask what's going on?

356
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:04,655
I'm putting a stop to it.

357
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:06,701
A stop to what?

358
00:29:06,832 --> 00:29:09,748
To what?

359
00:29:09,878 --> 00:29:12,751
Listen. Just...
No. Just listen.

360
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,190
That click?

361
00:29:18,278 --> 00:29:20,323
The click.

362
00:29:20,454 --> 00:29:23,022
The flame is lighting

363
00:29:23,152 --> 00:29:25,546
and then it keeps going out.

364
00:29:25,676 --> 00:29:30,420
So it's either a thermocouple
that's corroded

365
00:29:30,551 --> 00:29:33,336
or we have a short.

366
00:29:33,467 --> 00:29:36,339
A thermocouple is corroded.
Okay. I got it.

367
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:38,733
Hey, uh, maybe we could
just unplug it?

368
00:29:38,864 --> 00:29:40,909
Or cut a wire or something?
No. Listen.

369
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:45,871
I see no reason to stay down
here without hot water...

370
00:29:47,307 --> 00:29:49,067
when it's something
that I can easily fix.

371
00:29:49,135 --> 00:29:50,701
Aha!

372
00:29:50,832 --> 00:29:52,703
I think this will do the trick.

373
00:29:54,314 --> 00:29:56,634
You wouldn't happen to have
a pocket knife or a screwdriver

374
00:29:56,707 --> 00:29:58,231
in one of those bags, would you?

375
00:29:58,361 --> 00:29:59,493
No.

376
00:29:59,623 --> 00:30:01,408
What? Speak up!

377
00:30:01,538 --> 00:30:02,844
No.

378
00:30:14,638 --> 00:30:15,857
Come on!

379
00:30:15,988 --> 00:30:18,338
There we go.

380
00:30:25,649 --> 00:30:26,912
Yeah.

381
00:30:27,042 --> 00:30:28,522
This should work.

382
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,714
Hey, you're a scientist, right?

383
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,759
So, uh, I have a question.

384
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:51,110
What would you do
if you had a time machine?

385
00:30:52,633 --> 00:30:55,505
A time machine?

386
00:30:55,636 --> 00:30:57,812
Yeah, um...

387
00:30:57,943 --> 00:30:59,640
From a scientist's
point of view.

388
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:01,381
You can go backwards, forwards.

389
00:31:01,511 --> 00:31:02,991
Uh, where would you go?

390
00:31:03,122 --> 00:31:05,254
A meaningless question.

391
00:31:05,385 --> 00:31:06,516
Time...

392
00:31:06,647 --> 00:31:08,649
A time machine.

393
00:31:08,779 --> 00:31:11,130
Look, time travel,

394
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:13,480
the kind of time travel
that you're thinking of,

395
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:15,656
is a scientific impossibility.

396
00:31:15,786 --> 00:31:18,659
It would violate the Second Law
of Thermodynamics.

397
00:31:18,789 --> 00:31:21,096
Uh, but what about a wormhole?
Ohh!

398
00:31:21,227 --> 00:31:23,838
Well, I was watching "NOVA,"
and Alan Alda seemed to think...

399
00:31:23,969 --> 00:31:26,710
Oh, well, then Alan Alda...
He's the expert.

400
00:31:26,841 --> 00:31:29,626
Oh, Christ.
Are you kidding me?

401
00:31:29,757 --> 00:31:33,065
Quantum mechanics?
We're discussing that now?

402
00:31:34,327 --> 00:31:36,851
Stay in your lane.

403
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:43,075
It's just a thought experiment.

404
00:31:43,205 --> 00:31:45,183
There's gotta be something
you'd go back and change

405
00:31:45,207 --> 00:31:46,556
if you could.

406
00:31:51,431 --> 00:31:55,217
Oh, you are not talking
about a time machine,

407
00:31:55,348 --> 00:31:58,829
which is both a real
and theoretical impossibility.

408
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,354
You are talking about regrets.

409
00:32:01,484 --> 00:32:04,661
So if you want to ask
about regrets,

410
00:32:04,792 --> 00:32:08,622
just ask about regrets
and leave all this

411
00:32:08,752 --> 00:32:10,841
time-traveling nonsense
out of it.

412
00:32:10,972 --> 00:32:12,800
Okay. Regrets, then.

413
00:32:16,804 --> 00:32:18,458
Regrets.

414
00:32:18,588 --> 00:32:19,894
Yeah.

415
00:32:23,158 --> 00:32:24,943
My regrets.
All right, well...

416
00:32:29,512 --> 00:32:31,210
My regrets...

417
00:32:47,356 --> 00:32:48,749
Well...

418
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,977
When I was a graduate student,

419
00:32:59,107 --> 00:33:03,720
I started a company with some...

420
00:33:03,851 --> 00:33:06,158
At the time, I thought
they were my friends.

421
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:12,860
Our goal was to commercialize
discoveries that I had made.

422
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:16,559
And...

423
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:20,433
at a certain point...

424
00:33:20,563 --> 00:33:22,261
I stepped away.

425
00:33:22,391 --> 00:33:25,829
I thought I was doing
the gentlemanly thing.

426
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,614
But little did I understand

427
00:33:27,744 --> 00:33:30,704
that they were
artfully maneuvering me

428
00:33:30,834 --> 00:33:32,967
into leaving my own creation.

429
00:33:36,536 --> 00:33:38,886
And had I stayed, oh...

430
00:33:40,888 --> 00:33:43,717
Well...

431
00:33:43,847 --> 00:33:45,762
I wouldn't be down here
with you.

432
00:33:47,155 --> 00:33:49,984
So you started a company.
Is it still around?

433
00:33:51,855 --> 00:33:53,814
Oh, yes.

434
00:33:53,944 --> 00:33:56,034
Is it successful?

435
00:33:57,513 --> 00:33:59,124
Very.

436
00:33:59,254 --> 00:34:01,604
How could you never
tell me about this?

437
00:34:01,735 --> 00:34:03,693
We could have done
something with this.

438
00:34:03,824 --> 00:34:06,653
Wrongful termination,
intellectual property theft,

439
00:34:06,783 --> 00:34:08,133
uh, patent fraud.

440
00:34:08,263 --> 00:34:11,266
I mean, I coulda
sunk my teeth into this!

441
00:34:11,397 --> 00:34:15,314
You'd have been the last lawyer
I'd have gone to.

442
00:34:17,403 --> 00:34:19,013
Yeah. Sure.

443
00:34:22,799 --> 00:34:25,585
So, what about you?

444
00:34:25,715 --> 00:34:27,195
Regrets?

445
00:34:31,982 --> 00:34:33,941
Y... Wait. I got one.

446
00:34:38,946 --> 00:34:40,252
You know what?
Never mind.

447
00:34:40,382 --> 00:34:43,385
When I was
twenty... um, twenty-two,

448
00:34:43,516 --> 00:34:45,407
I pulled a slip and fall
outside Marshall Field's.

449
00:34:45,431 --> 00:34:46,867
Uh... I did.

450
00:34:46,997 --> 00:34:50,175
And I was stupid and young
and I was trying to show off.

451
00:34:50,305 --> 00:34:52,307
So I hit the ice
as fast as I could.

452
00:34:52,438 --> 00:34:54,962
I biffed it so hard,
I heard a crack!

453
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,617
Whew.
Wasn't the ice... it was me.

454
00:34:57,747 --> 00:35:00,837
I actually hurt myself.

455
00:35:00,968 --> 00:35:04,624
I mean, I... My knee
has never been the same.

456
00:35:06,321 --> 00:35:08,062
"A slip and fall"?

457
00:35:08,193 --> 00:35:11,718
Yeah. That's how I put myself
through bartending school.

458
00:35:13,502 --> 00:35:15,809
Right.

459
00:35:19,595 --> 00:35:20,944
So...

460
00:35:25,775 --> 00:35:28,213
So you were always like this.

461
00:36:23,485 --> 00:36:24,878
Sorry.

462
00:36:29,883 --> 00:36:31,711
Ssst! Bill! Hey.

463
00:36:31,841 --> 00:36:33,321
I'm just going to...

464
00:36:33,452 --> 00:36:37,064
Sir, this man is a federal
prisoner. I'm a U.S. Marshal.

465
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,675
I ask you not to speak to him.

466
00:36:39,806 --> 00:36:41,460
That's my lawyer.

467
00:36:43,026 --> 00:36:44,550
Is that true?
You're his lawyer?

468
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,378
Yes.

469
00:36:46,508 --> 00:36:48,269
You'll have other opportunities
to talk to your client.

470
00:36:48,293 --> 00:36:50,686
Please move
out of the aisle. No, hold on.

471
00:36:50,817 --> 00:36:53,863
N-Nothing I say in front of you
is privileged, right?

472
00:36:53,994 --> 00:36:55,648
That's right.

473
00:36:55,778 --> 00:36:57,867
So if I talk to my attorney
and we let something slip

474
00:36:57,998 --> 00:36:59,478
that could help
the government's case,

475
00:36:59,565 --> 00:37:01,567
you could pass it along
to the prosecution.

476
00:37:01,697 --> 00:37:03,133
Totally clean.

477
00:37:03,264 --> 00:37:05,571
Correct.

478
00:37:05,701 --> 00:37:08,400
With that in mind, you're sure
we can't have a few words?

479
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:17,060
Make it fast.

480
00:37:18,453 --> 00:37:21,151
She confessed.
What's the DA gonna do with it?

481
00:37:21,282 --> 00:37:24,372
No witnesses,
no physical evidence...

482
00:37:24,503 --> 00:37:26,026
If I had to guess...

483
00:37:26,156 --> 00:37:28,594
Most likely they sit on it.
Permanently.

484
00:37:30,596 --> 00:37:32,293
Okay.

485
00:37:32,424 --> 00:37:34,817
No, not "okay."

486
00:37:34,948 --> 00:37:36,645
Not for her.
Her problem's not the DA.

487
00:37:36,776 --> 00:37:38,604
What then?

488
00:37:38,734 --> 00:37:42,085
Well, apparently, Kim took her
sworn and notarized statement

489
00:37:42,216 --> 00:37:44,262
and hand delivered it
to Hamlin's widow.

490
00:37:44,392 --> 00:37:46,046
No.Yes.

491
00:37:46,176 --> 00:37:48,178
She opened herself up
to a civil suit.

492
00:37:48,309 --> 00:37:50,485
The widow can take her
for everything she has

493
00:37:50,616 --> 00:37:53,532
and everything she's gonna have,
in perpetuity.

494
00:37:53,662 --> 00:37:56,535
So, is she? Suing?

495
00:37:56,665 --> 00:37:59,059
Look, all I can tell you
for sure

496
00:37:59,189 --> 00:38:03,150
is that Mrs. Hamlin's out
lawyer shopping as we speak.

497
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,805
Not that she bothered
to call me.

498
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:12,115
Hey, can I, uh,
go to the john now?

499
00:38:14,509 --> 00:38:16,468
I'm going.

500
00:38:43,799 --> 00:38:45,018
Hold up, Bill.

501
00:38:45,148 --> 00:38:46,715
No, wait.
You're gonna love this.

502
00:38:46,846 --> 00:38:49,457
The Hamlin thing? The government
doesn't know the half of it.

503
00:38:49,588 --> 00:38:52,242
As soon as we land, I want you
to tell the other side

504
00:38:52,373 --> 00:38:54,070
that I've got more
to trade, okay?

505
00:38:54,201 --> 00:38:57,465
I j-just remembered something
that'll make their toes curl.

506
00:38:57,596 --> 00:38:59,249
Okay.

507
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:03,515
Anything that makes their "toes
curl" is bound to jam Kim up.

508
00:39:03,645 --> 00:39:04,907
If it involves her.

509
00:39:05,038 --> 00:39:06,866
Oh, it involves her.

510
00:39:06,996 --> 00:39:09,869
Kim's already got a civil suit
hanging over her head.

511
00:39:09,999 --> 00:39:12,306
You give the government more,

512
00:39:12,437 --> 00:39:14,352
maybe they bring
the hammer down.

513
00:39:16,266 --> 00:39:17,485
What more are you gonna get?

514
00:39:17,616 --> 00:39:19,052
What's left?

515
00:39:19,182 --> 00:39:20,532
You don't understand.

516
00:39:20,662 --> 00:39:22,534
It's really good ice cream.

517
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:49,125
Boys again? Girls this time.

518
00:39:49,256 --> 00:39:51,389
Well, she's not sleeping
for a year or two.

519
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:53,303
At least.
Is she coming back?

520
00:39:53,434 --> 00:39:54,914
She'll have to.

521
00:39:55,044 --> 00:39:56,481
Josh is a twin, isn't he?

522
00:39:56,611 --> 00:39:58,483
Oh, yeah. And it's
his birthday next week.

523
00:39:58,613 --> 00:40:00,528
I always take him out,
just the two of us,

524
00:40:00,659 --> 00:40:02,245
because, you know,
he had to share everything.

525
00:40:02,269 --> 00:40:04,184
Well, that's nice. It's either Red Lobster

526
00:40:04,314 --> 00:40:05,968
or that new
Middle Eastern place...

527
00:40:06,099 --> 00:40:07,274
The one over on Wickham.

528
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,058
Top something? Topkapi.

529
00:40:09,189 --> 00:40:10,756
That's it. Topkapi.

530
00:40:10,886 --> 00:40:13,759
Glen took you there, didn't he?
What'd you guys think?

531
00:40:13,889 --> 00:40:17,066
Uh, it wasn't...

532
00:40:17,197 --> 00:40:19,199
Not good, huh?

533
00:40:19,329 --> 00:40:21,375
No, uh.
No. It was fine.

534
00:40:21,506 --> 00:40:23,290
Would Josh like it?

535
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,033
He... He might.

536
00:40:27,163 --> 00:40:29,383
Okay. Another birthday
at Red Lobster.

537
00:40:29,514 --> 00:40:31,211
He can live with that.

538
00:40:31,341 --> 00:40:34,388
What did we get them for
the shower? A stroller, right?

539
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:36,825
Yeah, one of the nice ones
with the shock absorbers.

540
00:40:36,956 --> 00:40:41,351
With twins? They might need
a double stroller...

541
00:41:02,372 --> 00:41:06,028
You, too, Donny.

542
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:11,251
Seana, Donny from
TPC Sawgrass, line four.

543
00:41:11,381 --> 00:41:12,644
Hey, Tammy.
I'm leaving early.

544
00:41:12,774 --> 00:41:13,993
Can you let Ricardo know?

545
00:41:14,123 --> 00:41:15,516
Sure. No prob.

546
00:41:15,647 --> 00:41:17,300
Thanks.

547
00:41:17,431 --> 00:41:18,476
Palm Coast Sprinkler.

548
00:41:18,606 --> 00:41:20,956
Watering your world
since 1978...

549
00:42:36,771 --> 00:42:39,165
If he shows up,
you keep that door locked.

550
00:42:39,295 --> 00:42:41,646
You call the police,
and then you call me.

551
00:42:41,776 --> 00:42:44,126
Any time, day or night.
Okay?

552
00:42:44,257 --> 00:42:45,780
Okay.
I'll see you Thursday.

553
00:42:45,911 --> 00:42:47,782
Let me know if you need me
to pick you up.

554
00:42:47,913 --> 00:42:49,436
All right. Thank you.Okay.

555
00:42:56,095 --> 00:42:57,575
Ladies, it's right this way.

556
00:42:57,705 --> 00:43:00,403
Sorry about the heat.
AC's on the fritz.

557
00:43:09,674 --> 00:43:12,590
Fill this out. And, before
you ask, there's no charge.

558
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,461
All our services are free.

559
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:18,421
Oh, a-actually, I'm here
to see if I can volunteer.

560
00:43:18,552 --> 00:43:20,075
You want to volunteer?

561
00:43:20,206 --> 00:43:21,816
Yes.

562
00:43:21,947 --> 00:43:23,426
Can you answer a phone?

563
00:43:23,557 --> 00:43:24,558
Sure.

564
00:43:24,689 --> 00:43:26,386
Then there you go.

565
00:43:33,001 --> 00:43:36,614
Central Florida Legal Aid.
How can I help you?

566
00:44:14,782 --> 00:44:15,870
Hello?

567
00:44:16,001 --> 00:44:18,133
Kim?
Yes.

568
00:44:18,264 --> 00:44:20,222
This is Suzanne Ericsen.

569
00:44:20,353 --> 00:44:22,007
Hi, Suzanne.

570
00:44:22,137 --> 00:44:25,445
I want to make it clear this
call is completely unofficial.

571
00:44:25,575 --> 00:44:27,012
All right.

572
00:44:27,142 --> 00:44:28,796
I shouldn't even
be talking to you.

573
00:44:28,927 --> 00:44:30,929
But considering everything,
I think it's only right

574
00:44:31,059 --> 00:44:32,539
you know what's going on.

575
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,237
You've seen the news?

576
00:44:35,368 --> 00:44:36,630
I don't think so.

577
00:44:36,761 --> 00:44:39,677
Your ex, "Saul Goodman"?

578
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:41,679
He was arrested in Nebraska.

579
00:44:41,809 --> 00:44:43,942
He's been extradited
to New Mexico.

580
00:44:47,902 --> 00:44:49,121
When was this?

581
00:44:49,251 --> 00:44:51,427
Two days ago.

582
00:44:51,558 --> 00:44:54,169
But that's not why I'm calling.

583
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:57,825
He's giving testimony
that affects you, personally.

584
00:45:01,481 --> 00:45:04,049
What kind of testimony?

585
00:45:23,285 --> 00:45:27,812
Only believe

586
00:45:27,942 --> 00:45:29,465
My Lordy

587
00:45:29,596 --> 00:45:37,596
Only believe

588
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:41,477
All things

589
00:45:41,608 --> 00:45:45,743
Are possible

590
00:45:45,873 --> 00:45:50,225
If you'll only

591
00:45:50,356 --> 00:45:54,490
Believe

592
00:45:54,621 --> 00:45:55,665
Lordy

593
00:45:55,796 --> 00:46:01,889
Only believe

594
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:04,196
Yeah My Lordy

595
00:46:04,326 --> 00:46:11,856
Only believe

596
00:46:11,986 --> 00:46:12,987
Ohh

597
00:46:13,118 --> 00:46:20,081
All things are possible

598
00:46:20,212 --> 00:46:24,520
If you only

599
00:46:24,651 --> 00:46:32,651
Belie-e-e-ve

600
00:46:44,192 --> 00:46:45,977
It's showtime.

601
00:46:47,892 --> 00:46:49,415
All rise

602
00:46:49,545 --> 00:46:52,287
for the right honorable
Judge Samantha Small.

603
00:46:56,030 --> 00:46:58,772
Court's now in session.
Please take a seat.

604
00:47:03,516 --> 00:47:08,216
Okay, item one on the calendar,

605
00:47:08,347 --> 00:47:14,135
CR 10-7253 United States
of America versus...

606
00:47:14,266 --> 00:47:17,443
Defendant has requested
to use the name Saul Goodman.

607
00:47:17,573 --> 00:47:21,795
So it's "United States
versus Saul Goodman."

608
00:47:21,926 --> 00:47:26,017
Counsel, please state
your appearances.

609
00:47:26,147 --> 00:47:28,889
AUSA George Castellano.

610
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:32,632
With me is Elizabeth Nooryani,
Trial Attorney from the

611
00:47:32,762 --> 00:47:36,114
Drug Enforcement Section
of the Department of Justice;

612
00:47:36,244 --> 00:47:39,813
AUSAs Sarah Braddock,
Neel Patel, and Hillary Park

613
00:47:39,944 --> 00:47:43,251
and Special Agent in Charge
Austin Ramey from the D.E.A.

614
00:47:43,382 --> 00:47:44,862
Also present in the courtroom:

615
00:47:44,992 --> 00:47:46,820
Zachary Hernandez,
Special Agent in Charge

616
00:47:46,951 --> 00:47:49,388
of the FBI in New Mexico.

617
00:47:49,518 --> 00:47:51,918
Your Honor, I'd also like to
note the presence of the victims

618
00:47:51,999 --> 00:47:53,871
who are here this morning...

619
00:47:54,001 --> 00:47:56,961
Marie Schrader and Blanca Gomez.

620
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:03,184
William Oakley appearing
as advisory counsel.

621
00:48:03,315 --> 00:48:06,013
Saul Goodman appearing
on his own behalf.

622
00:48:06,144 --> 00:48:07,710
Good morning.

623
00:48:07,841 --> 00:48:10,713
The defendant still wants
to represent himself?

624
00:48:10,844 --> 00:48:13,673
Uh...
That's right, your Honor.

625
00:48:13,803 --> 00:48:15,501
Okay.

626
00:48:18,243 --> 00:48:20,419
The parties have reached
a plea agreement

627
00:48:20,549 --> 00:48:22,290
satisfactory to both sides.

628
00:48:22,421 --> 00:48:24,771
However, I have reviewed
the government's

629
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:27,687
sentencing recommendations
and...

630
00:48:27,817 --> 00:48:30,124
well, I have questions.

631
00:48:30,255 --> 00:48:33,345
Mr. Castellano, will you please
come up to the microphone?

632
00:48:40,874 --> 00:48:44,182
Mr. Castellano,
today we consider the sentence

633
00:48:44,312 --> 00:48:47,315
for a defendant
who will be pleading guilty

634
00:48:47,446 --> 00:48:50,014
to multiple felonies,
RICO offenses,

635
00:48:50,144 --> 00:48:52,494
money laundering, conspiracy,

636
00:48:52,625 --> 00:48:57,978
accessory after the fact to
the murder of federal officers.

637
00:48:58,109 --> 00:49:00,024
And for these offenses,

638
00:49:00,154 --> 00:49:04,854
the government's sentencing
recommendation is seven years.

639
00:49:04,985 --> 00:49:07,505
Your Honor, I can
assure you my colleagues and I gave

640
00:49:07,596 --> 00:49:09,468
every aspect
of this recommendation

641
00:49:09,598 --> 00:49:11,296
careful consideration.

642
00:49:11,426 --> 00:49:13,080
Help me understand.

643
00:49:13,211 --> 00:49:14,603
Has the defendant provided

644
00:49:14,734 --> 00:49:16,334
substantial assistance
to the government?

645
00:49:16,388 --> 00:49:17,563
Your Honor?

646
00:49:17,693 --> 00:49:20,044
Mr. Oakley,
please advise your client

647
00:49:20,174 --> 00:49:21,784
to stay silent at this time.

648
00:49:21,915 --> 00:49:25,005
Your Honor, with respect,
Mr. Oakley is advisory counsel.

649
00:49:25,136 --> 00:49:27,573
I'm representing myself
here today.

650
00:49:27,703 --> 00:49:30,315
If I may say something that
I think will help the court

651
00:49:30,445 --> 00:49:32,404
fully understand the situation?

652
00:49:32,534 --> 00:49:35,189
Mr. Goodman,
you are the beneficiary

653
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,931
of the most generous
sentencing recommendation

654
00:49:38,062 --> 00:49:40,368
I've seen in 22 years
on the bench.

655
00:49:40,499 --> 00:49:43,589
Any statement you make
imperils that recommendation.

656
00:49:43,719 --> 00:49:45,156
I'm very aware of that,
Your Honor.

657
00:49:45,286 --> 00:49:47,506
Uh, if you'll allow me to speak,

658
00:49:47,636 --> 00:49:51,118
I... I think I can save
the court's valuable time.

659
00:49:54,426 --> 00:49:57,168
Go ahead. Briefly.

660
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:14,489
Two years ago
a man came into my office.

661
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:17,449
He said his name was Mayhew.

662
00:50:17,579 --> 00:50:22,149
He wanted one of my clients
to lie for him under oath.

663
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:23,803
He offered me money.

664
00:50:23,933 --> 00:50:26,153
I refused.

665
00:50:26,284 --> 00:50:30,592
That night, as I was leaving
my office, I was attacked.

666
00:50:30,723 --> 00:50:34,335
A bag was shoved over my head,
I was hogtied,

667
00:50:34,466 --> 00:50:36,250
I was driven
out into the desert.

668
00:50:36,381 --> 00:50:37,991
And when they pulled
the hood off,

669
00:50:38,122 --> 00:50:39,732
I was kneeling
in front of an open grave

670
00:50:39,862 --> 00:50:42,952
with a gun pointed at my head.

671
00:50:43,083 --> 00:50:47,479
That was my introduction
to Walter White!

672
00:50:47,609 --> 00:50:49,742
I was terrified.

673
00:50:54,877 --> 00:50:57,358
But not for long.

674
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:02,537
That night, I saw opportunity.

675
00:51:02,668 --> 00:51:04,974
A shot at big money.

676
00:51:05,105 --> 00:51:07,673
And I grabbed it
and I held it tight.

677
00:51:07,803 --> 00:51:12,373
And for the next sixteen months,
my every waking moment

678
00:51:12,504 --> 00:51:15,376
was spent building
Walter White's drug empire.

679
00:51:15,507 --> 00:51:18,684
Hold on, Mr. Goodman.
Stop right there.

680
00:51:18,814 --> 00:51:21,295
Consult Mr. Oakley
before you say another word.

681
00:51:21,426 --> 00:51:24,472
Your Honor, I believe the court
deserves the whole truth.

682
00:51:24,603 --> 00:51:26,866
You are contradicting
your plea agreement's

683
00:51:26,996 --> 00:51:29,173
sworn factual basis.

684
00:51:29,303 --> 00:51:30,783
No offense, Your Honor, but I...

685
00:51:30,913 --> 00:51:33,002
I think I know the law here
better than you do.

686
00:51:33,133 --> 00:51:34,961
Your Honor, we'd like
to request a recess.

687
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:36,702
No, we do not need a recess.

688
00:51:36,832 --> 00:51:39,748
Your Honor, we are satisfied
for Mr. Goodman to continue.

689
00:51:39,879 --> 00:51:43,230
Your Honor, I'd like to petition
to withdraw from this case.

690
00:51:43,361 --> 00:51:45,754
Denied. Respectfully...

691
00:51:45,885 --> 00:51:47,756
Not a chance.

692
00:51:50,498 --> 00:51:52,370
Bobbi,
swear Mr. Goodman in.

693
00:51:56,852 --> 00:51:58,419
Do you swear that the evidence

694
00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:00,508
you shall give to the court
in this matter

695
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:03,207
shall be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth

696
00:52:03,337 --> 00:52:04,469
so help you God?

697
00:52:04,599 --> 00:52:06,688
I do.

698
00:52:06,819 --> 00:52:10,039
Mr. Goodman,
you are now under oath.

699
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:13,565
Any false statement you make
can be used in prosecution

700
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:16,437
for perjury
or obstruction of justice.

701
00:52:16,568 --> 00:52:17,569
Do you understand?

702
00:52:17,699 --> 00:52:19,092
Yes.

703
00:52:19,223 --> 00:52:20,485
All right.

704
00:52:20,615 --> 00:52:21,964
In the last 24 hours,

705
00:52:22,095 --> 00:52:23,705
have you used any alcohol
or other drugs?

706
00:52:23,836 --> 00:52:25,229
No, Your Honor.

707
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:27,274
Are you taking any
prescription medications?

708
00:52:27,405 --> 00:52:28,754
No.

709
00:52:28,884 --> 00:52:31,235
All right.

710
00:52:31,365 --> 00:52:32,758
Continue.

711
00:52:40,418 --> 00:52:46,032
Oh, um, I lied to the government
about, uh, Kim Wexler.

712
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:49,209
Uh, I fed them a load of B.S.

713
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:51,864
about her involvement
in Howard Hamlin's murder.

714
00:52:51,994 --> 00:52:54,823
I just... I just wanted her
to come here today.

715
00:52:54,954 --> 00:52:56,869
I wanted her to hear this.

716
00:53:01,134 --> 00:53:03,397
So, yeah, I wasn't there
when the meth was cooked.

717
00:53:03,528 --> 00:53:05,356
I wasn't there when it was sold.

718
00:53:05,486 --> 00:53:07,096
I didn't witness
any of the murders.

719
00:53:07,227 --> 00:53:09,316
But I damn well knew
it was happening.

720
00:53:09,447 --> 00:53:11,840
I was more than
a willing participant.

721
00:53:11,971 --> 00:53:13,799
I was indispensable.

722
00:53:13,929 --> 00:53:17,194
I kept Walter White out of jail,
I laundered his money,

723
00:53:17,324 --> 00:53:19,544
I lied for him,
I conspired with him,

724
00:53:19,674 --> 00:53:23,287
and I made millions.

725
00:53:23,417 --> 00:53:26,203
If he hadn't walked
into my office that day,

726
00:53:26,333 --> 00:53:28,596
Walter White
would have been dead

727
00:53:28,727 --> 00:53:31,512
or behind bars within a month.

728
00:53:33,732 --> 00:53:36,865
And Agent Schrader
and Agent Gomez

729
00:53:36,996 --> 00:53:40,304
and a whole lot of other people
would still be alive.

730
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:43,742
The fact is,

731
00:53:43,872 --> 00:53:45,918
Walter White
couldn't have done it

732
00:53:46,048 --> 00:53:47,572
without me.

733
00:53:49,443 --> 00:53:51,967
You got that?

734
00:53:52,098 --> 00:53:54,796
Your Honor, we move to
strike Mr. Goodman's comments.

735
00:53:54,927 --> 00:53:56,047
On what grounds?

736
00:53:56,102 --> 00:53:58,191
Speculation. Speculation?

737
00:53:58,322 --> 00:54:00,324
He's testifying
to his own actions.

738
00:54:00,454 --> 00:54:02,717
Your Honor, uh,
he's describing events

739
00:54:02,848 --> 00:54:05,154
that wouldhave transpired
had he acted differently.

740
00:54:05,285 --> 00:54:06,939
I have one more thing to say.

741
00:54:07,069 --> 00:54:09,420
- Sit down, Mr. Goodman. Now.
- Please, your Honor. Please.

742
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:11,465
The government urges the court

743
00:54:11,596 --> 00:54:13,293
to allow Mr. Goodman
to continue.

744
00:54:13,424 --> 00:54:15,426
How is that not speculation?

745
00:54:21,083 --> 00:54:22,955
All right, Mr. Goodman.

746
00:54:23,085 --> 00:54:24,435
Go ahead.

747
00:54:28,743 --> 00:54:31,006
What happened
to Howard Hamlin...

748
00:54:31,137 --> 00:54:33,052
it was...

749
00:54:33,182 --> 00:54:34,619
it was...

750
00:54:37,448 --> 00:54:39,014
I can't even...

751
00:54:43,715 --> 00:54:46,544
After that,

752
00:54:46,674 --> 00:54:49,111
Kim had the guts to start over.

753
00:54:49,242 --> 00:54:51,723
She left town, but...

754
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,988
I'm the one who ran away.

755
00:55:00,993 --> 00:55:03,909
And my brother Chuck...

756
00:55:04,039 --> 00:55:06,520
Uh, Charles McGill.

757
00:55:06,651 --> 00:55:08,870
Y-You may have known him.

758
00:55:11,133 --> 00:55:13,875
He was an incredible lawyer,
as...

759
00:55:14,006 --> 00:55:16,443
The most brilliant guy
I ever met.

760
00:55:16,574 --> 00:55:19,141
But he was limited.

761
00:55:19,272 --> 00:55:21,796
I tried.

762
00:55:21,927 --> 00:55:23,755
I could have tried harder.

763
00:55:25,931 --> 00:55:27,454
I should have.

764
00:55:29,238 --> 00:55:31,458
Instead, when... Your Honor.

765
00:55:31,589 --> 00:55:34,548
Bill, please.
Just let me get through this.

766
00:55:36,071 --> 00:55:39,684
Instead, when I saw a chance
to hurt him, I took it.

767
00:55:43,949 --> 00:55:47,735
I got his malpractice insurance
canceled.

768
00:55:47,866 --> 00:55:50,521
I took away
the one thing he lived for...

769
00:55:50,651 --> 00:55:52,218
The law.

770
00:55:54,655 --> 00:55:56,353
After that, he killed himself.

771
00:56:03,664 --> 00:56:05,362
And I'll live with that.

772
00:56:15,937 --> 00:56:17,722
What was all that?

773
00:56:17,852 --> 00:56:20,377
That thing with your brother,
that wasn't even a crime.

774
00:56:20,507 --> 00:56:21,943
Yeah, it was.

775
00:56:22,074 --> 00:56:26,687
Mr. Goodman, sit down
and stay seated.

776
00:56:26,818 --> 00:56:28,950
The name's McGill.

777
00:56:29,081 --> 00:56:30,952
I'm James McGill.

778
00:56:32,214 --> 00:56:33,844
Nooryani: Your Honor, in view of
the defendant's confession...

779
00:56:33,868 --> 00:56:35,957
Your Honor,
we'd like to request a recess...

780
00:56:36,088 --> 00:56:38,022
the Government withdraws its
sentencing recommendation... Now, hold on.

781
00:56:38,046 --> 00:56:39,763
That was not a confession.
That was... and urges this court

782
00:56:39,787 --> 00:56:41,809
to impose the statutory maximum
for each of these offenses.

783
00:56:41,833 --> 00:56:43,724
That was not a confession. It was
merely, uh, a single point of view...

784
00:56:43,748 --> 00:56:45,465
Furthermore, your Honor,
a second additional hearing

785
00:56:45,489 --> 00:56:47,162
is required... in a very complex,
uh, narrative...

786
00:56:47,186 --> 00:56:48,772
in order to assess the
additional claims Mr. Goodman...

787
00:56:48,796 --> 00:56:50,252
I'm sorry... Mr. McGill
has now admitted to...

788
00:56:50,276 --> 00:56:52,234
including perjury on
this court, your Honor.

789
00:56:59,981 --> 00:57:01,200
Did you ground yourself?

790
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:02,767
Yes, I did!

791
00:57:02,897 --> 00:57:04,856
Oh, crap!

792
00:57:16,258 --> 00:57:17,825
I was starting to worry.

793
00:57:17,956 --> 00:57:20,045
My car conked out on I-40.

794
00:57:20,175 --> 00:57:22,308
I almost got creamed
by a cement truck.

795
00:57:29,663 --> 00:57:33,885
Oh, um, they had those apples
that you like.

796
00:57:34,015 --> 00:57:36,627
I got you half a dozen Fuji.

797
00:57:36,757 --> 00:57:39,891
Um, and the newsstand on Central

798
00:57:40,021 --> 00:57:42,328
said they might start carrying
the Financial Times.

799
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,722
So that's good, right?

800
00:57:57,125 --> 00:57:58,562
What?

801
00:57:58,692 --> 00:58:00,738
You know, I could
hire someone to do this.

802
00:58:00,868 --> 00:58:03,654
I could get someone
from the office.

803
00:58:03,784 --> 00:58:04,916
I'm doing it.

804
00:58:05,046 --> 00:58:06,483
Yeah, every day?

805
00:58:06,613 --> 00:58:09,616
While you're trying
to start a... practice?

806
00:58:09,747 --> 00:58:10,747
Why?

807
00:58:10,835 --> 00:58:13,272
Why?

808
00:58:13,402 --> 00:58:14,752
'Cause you're my brother.

809
00:58:14,882 --> 00:58:17,102
Duh.
You'd do the same for me.

810
00:58:20,148 --> 00:58:22,237
Mm. Well, you could stay
for a while.

811
00:58:22,368 --> 00:58:23,804
We could talk.

812
00:58:23,935 --> 00:58:26,024
Talk? What about?

813
00:58:28,069 --> 00:58:30,594
Well, your cases.
Your clients.

814
00:58:30,724 --> 00:58:32,813
Youwant to talk about myclients?

815
00:58:32,944 --> 00:58:35,337
Seriously?
You want to talk about, uh,

816
00:58:35,468 --> 00:58:37,949
the granny who got picked up
for soliciting

817
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:40,691
inside the Christian Science
Reading Room?

818
00:58:40,821 --> 00:58:43,432
Wh... What about the kid
who broke into a liquor store

819
00:58:43,563 --> 00:58:45,826
and drank five bottles
of crème de menthe

820
00:58:45,957 --> 00:58:47,524
and then passed out
behind the counter?

821
00:58:47,654 --> 00:58:49,526
They deserve a vigorous defense.

822
00:58:49,656 --> 00:58:51,440
Like any other client.

823
00:58:53,007 --> 00:58:55,444
Or maybe you just wanna tell me
what I'm doing wrong.

824
00:58:55,575 --> 00:58:57,272
That's not what I had in mind.

825
00:59:09,371 --> 00:59:12,374
I'm hoping you didn't steal
that from a motel ice machine.

826
00:59:12,505 --> 00:59:14,855
You can hope.

827
00:59:14,986 --> 00:59:18,163
I'm gonna take a pass
on the heart-to-heart, Chuck.

828
00:59:18,293 --> 00:59:21,601
One of my "deserving" clients...

829
00:59:21,732 --> 00:59:26,127
He got caught waving the weenie
outside a Hobby Lobby.

830
00:59:26,258 --> 00:59:28,913
Hold on. You got to
reimburse yourself.

831
00:59:29,043 --> 00:59:30,915
Mnh. This one's on me.

832
00:59:31,045 --> 00:59:34,222
Jimmy...

833
00:59:34,353 --> 00:59:36,007
If you don't like
where you're heading,

834
00:59:36,137 --> 00:59:40,402
there's no shame in going back
and changing your path.

835
00:59:42,013 --> 00:59:44,842
Ohh. When have you ever
"changed your path"?

836
00:59:48,497 --> 00:59:51,544
Hey. Think on it.

837
00:59:51,675 --> 00:59:54,591
We always end up having
the same conversation, don't we?

838
00:59:57,071 --> 00:59:58,551
I'll see ya tomorrow, Chuck.

839
00:59:58,682 --> 01:00:01,293
And I might have
the Financial Times.

840
01:01:50,141 --> 01:01:51,577
I know you?

841
01:02:06,592 --> 01:02:08,681
Hey.

842
01:02:08,812 --> 01:02:11,249
"Better Call Saul."

843
01:02:11,379 --> 01:02:12,816
Right?

844
01:02:14,905 --> 01:02:16,254
McGill.

845
01:02:16,384 --> 01:02:17,908
Wha'?

846
01:02:18,038 --> 01:02:20,258
I'm McGill.

847
01:02:21,825 --> 01:02:23,652
Don't give me that.

848
01:02:23,783 --> 01:02:25,176
You're Saul!

849
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:31,095
It's Better Call Saul.

850
01:02:33,010 --> 01:02:37,231
No shit.
Psst! Psst!

851
01:02:37,971 --> 01:02:39,930
Back here, yo.

852
01:02:43,281 --> 01:02:44,281
Back here.

853
01:02:52,333 --> 01:02:54,771
See? Toldja!

854
01:02:54,901 --> 01:02:56,685
It's Better Call Saul!

855
01:02:56,816 --> 01:02:59,427
You're right.
Better Call Saul.

856
01:03:01,690 --> 01:03:04,215
Yeah.
Better Call Saul.

857
01:03:06,521 --> 01:03:07,784
Better...

858
01:03:07,914 --> 01:03:09,307
Call...

859
01:03:09,437 --> 01:03:10,437
Saul.

860
01:03:11,831 --> 01:03:13,398
Better...

861
01:03:13,528 --> 01:03:15,313
Call...

862
01:03:15,443 --> 01:03:16,443
Saul.

863
01:03:18,316 --> 01:03:21,580
Better Call Saul!

864
01:03:23,669 --> 01:03:26,541
Better Call Saul!

865
01:03:26,672 --> 01:03:28,805
Better Call Saul!

866
01:03:30,154 --> 01:03:33,157
All of you, shut up! Better Call Saul!

867
01:03:33,287 --> 01:03:36,160
Better Call Saul! I said shut up!

868
01:03:36,290 --> 01:03:38,989
Better Call Saul! Shut the hell up!

869
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:41,861
Better Call Saul! Shut the hell up!

870
01:03:41,992 --> 01:03:44,472
Better Call Saul!

871
01:03:44,603 --> 01:03:45,865
Better Call...

872
01:04:06,538 --> 01:04:08,496
Saul!
Lawyer's here!

873
01:04:13,675 --> 01:04:15,329
I got ya, Saul.

874
01:04:41,181 --> 01:04:43,183
Ma'am? No cuffs, please.

875
01:04:51,975 --> 01:04:53,585
Thank you.

876
01:05:03,943 --> 01:05:05,553
Hi, Jimmy.

877
01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:09,906
Hi.

878
01:05:12,778 --> 01:05:14,954
How did you...?

879
01:05:15,085 --> 01:05:17,435
Uh, turns out
my New Mexico bar card

880
01:05:17,565 --> 01:05:19,524
doesn't have an expiration date.

881
01:06:28,636 --> 01:06:30,595
You had them down
to seven years.

882
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:35,034
Yeah, I did.

883
01:06:43,912 --> 01:06:45,697
Eighty-six years.

884
01:06:54,575 --> 01:06:56,055
Eighty-six years.

885
01:07:06,457 --> 01:07:10,765
But with good behavior...

886
01:07:10,896 --> 01:07:12,898
who knows?

887
01:08:35,807 --> 01:08:37,635
Here we go, here we go.

888
01:09:34,953 --> 01:09:38,043
I'm Bob Odenkirk,
and I wanted to say hi.

889
01:09:44,397 --> 01:09:47,183
I want to say thank you to
the fans of "Better Call Saul."

890
01:09:47,313 --> 01:09:49,228
How do I even begin
to thank the fans?

891
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:50,882
Hmm. I'll try not to cry.

892
01:09:51,012 --> 01:09:53,406
We are nothing without the fans.

893
01:09:53,537 --> 01:09:55,713
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

894
01:09:55,843 --> 01:09:57,845
I'm not finding the words
I'd like,

895
01:09:57,976 --> 01:10:01,197
so let's pause it for a second,
just one second.

896
01:10:02,850 --> 01:10:04,852
I got to play
Howard Hamlin for six years,

897
01:10:04,983 --> 01:10:06,613
and the only reason
I got to do it for six years

898
01:10:06,637 --> 01:10:08,247
is because of the fans.

899
01:10:08,378 --> 01:10:10,269
You guys have truly
been Kim Wexler's confidante

900
01:10:10,293 --> 01:10:13,034
in many, many, many scenes,
her closest confidante.

901
01:10:13,165 --> 01:10:14,819
And I appreciate it so much.

902
01:10:14,949 --> 01:10:17,996
The fans have shown
an appreciation that gave me

903
01:10:18,126 --> 01:10:21,391
a greater appreciation
for the stories

904
01:10:21,521 --> 01:10:24,132
and reminded me
how fortunate I am

905
01:10:24,263 --> 01:10:25,786
to have been a part of it.

906
01:10:25,917 --> 01:10:28,049
Took us a long time
to get this thing done.

907
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:31,009
We really enjoyed it, and I hope
you guys enjoy it just as much.

908
01:10:31,139 --> 01:10:33,272
This show has you
on the edge of your seat,

909
01:10:33,403 --> 01:10:36,319
and you fans are responsible
for keeping us here

910
01:10:36,449 --> 01:10:39,365
and having us make really
wonderful, powerful,

911
01:10:39,496 --> 01:10:42,716
profound entertainment,
so thank you.

912
01:10:42,847 --> 01:10:46,111
From the bottom of my heart,
thank you so much.

913
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:48,244
Hey, "Better Call Saul" fans.

914
01:10:48,374 --> 01:10:50,637
Hey, it's Vince. And Peter.

915
01:10:50,768 --> 01:10:53,249
I'm sad that this era
has come to an end.

916
01:10:53,379 --> 01:10:54,598
That's a wrap.

917
01:10:54,728 --> 01:10:56,513
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

918
01:10:56,643 --> 01:10:58,752
I gotta thank
everybody who's watched the show.

919
01:10:58,776 --> 01:11:02,475
What a wonderful, wonderful time
of my life.

920
01:11:02,606 --> 01:11:05,086
And hope we've made you happy.

921
01:11:05,217 --> 01:11:06,305
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

922
01:11:06,436 --> 01:11:07,437
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

923
01:11:07,567 --> 01:11:09,090
Thank you so much.
