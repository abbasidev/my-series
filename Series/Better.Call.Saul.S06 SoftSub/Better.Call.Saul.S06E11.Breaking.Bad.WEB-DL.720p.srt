1
00:00:10,378 --> 00:00:13,114
Guys, come on, talk to me!

2
00:00:14,882 --> 00:00:16,484
<i>Habla, por favor?</i>

3
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:18,052
<i>Yo soy abogado!</i>

4
00:00:18,186 --> 00:00:19,453
<i>Abogado! Abogado!</i>

5
00:00:19,587 --> 00:00:21,889
Oh. Crap,
you already knew that.

6
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,657
Jesus, fellas?

7
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:25,071
There's a better way to do this!

8
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:27,328
Hello?

9
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:30,164
Ohh. Why are we...
Why are we going off-road?

10
00:00:30,298 --> 00:00:32,533
Ohh! Ohh!

11
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:35,569
Whatever this is, can we please,
don't do it in the desert?

12
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:37,071
Anywhere but the desert!

13
00:00:37,205 --> 00:00:40,208
Oh! Oh, God, I'm gonna be sick.

14
00:00:40,341 --> 00:00:41,609
Ohh!

15
00:00:43,844 --> 00:00:46,247
Ahh. Ahh.

16
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:50,751
This, we can... we can fix this.

17
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:54,122
Whatever the problemo,
we can fix it with <i>dinero.</i>

18
00:00:54,255 --> 00:00:56,023
<i>Mucho dinero.</i>

19
00:00:56,157 --> 00:00:58,058
<i>Mucho, mucho, mucho dinero.</i>

20
00:00:58,192 --> 00:01:00,094
Come on, please.

21
00:01:00,228 --> 00:01:01,662
One of you, just you talk.

22
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:02,863
<i>Habla.</i>

23
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:05,433
Come on,
before mistakes are made.

24
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,501
Come on, talk to me, guys, huh?

25
00:01:07,635 --> 00:01:09,903
Please, come on,
just tell me what you want!

26
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:11,037
Geez!

27
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:13,573
Whoa!

28
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:16,644
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

29
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:18,346
No! It wasn't me!

30
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,348
It was Ignacio! He's the one!

31
00:01:56,884 --> 00:01:59,287
You can't put seeds and stems
in the sink.

32
00:02:00,488 --> 00:02:02,122
Put what or what?

33
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:03,491
Seeds and stems.

34
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,493
You can't put them
down the drain.

35
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:08,061
Uh, we didn't do that.

36
00:02:08,196 --> 00:02:09,197
Then what's this?

37
00:02:10,398 --> 00:02:12,633
Regular sink stuff.

38
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:14,935
Listen,
if you're gonna do this shit,

39
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:16,813
at least flush it
down the toilet, not the sink.

40
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:18,672
W-What're you, my mom?

41
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:20,308
We don't have drugs here.

42
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,276
Uh-huh.

43
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,178
You don't believe us.

44
00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:25,946
She doesn't believe us.

45
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:29,417
You sleep past noon, you don't
seem to have regular employment.

46
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,586
Plus, your whole place
smells like a skunk's butthole.

47
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,689
Also, your sink is full
of stems and seeds.

48
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:37,725
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Look, narca,

49
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:39,360
we're not doing drugs,

50
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,995
so stop trying to cast,
y'know...

51
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,166
aspersions.

52
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,568
Narca?

53
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:48,769
Yeah. "Narca."

54
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,638
The feminine version
of "narco."

55
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:53,507
Conjugate much?

56
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,184
I gotta go.

57
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:06,496
Just leave the plunger outside
the door when you're done.

58
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,223
But, uh,
it's still clogged, dude.

59
00:03:09,357 --> 00:03:11,792
You do it, dude.

60
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:13,227
Hold up, where you goin'?

61
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:15,529
Yo, lady, we pay rent.

62
00:03:15,663 --> 00:03:16,663
You can do it.

63
00:03:16,764 --> 00:03:18,399
It's a simple
up and down motion,

64
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:19,667
like you're used to.

65
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,758
Okay. Okay.

66
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:51,891
Okay.

67
00:06:11,472 --> 00:06:12,540
Yeah.

68
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:15,308
<i>Oh, good.
You're there. Great.</i>

69
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:17,377
<i>Great.</i>

70
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:19,780
<i>Unencumbered by curious
eyes and ears, I'm guessing.</i>

71
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:21,233
Wouldn't have
picked up otherwise.

72
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:22,348
<i>Right.</i>

73
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:23,783
Excellent.

74
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:26,053
Um, okay. Well, then.

75
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:27,788
Lay it on me.

76
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:28,921
<i>First things first.</i>

77
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:32,726
No. I... I believe
we agreed "after."

78
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:34,728
I'm hanging up.

79
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:35,862
Okay! Okay, then!

80
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:36,896
Geez, I...

81
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:42,970
Okay, if you're...
if you're facing the phone,

82
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:46,239
turn right 90 degrees
and, uh, walk straight.

83
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:49,877
<i>You'll see some pieces
of broken concrete in the dirt.</i>

84
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:54,214
Just pull back the one that's
kinda shaped like New Jersey.

85
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:55,549
<i>New Jersey?</i>

86
00:06:55,683 --> 00:06:57,585
Alfred Hitchcock in a fez.

87
00:06:57,718 --> 00:06:58,852
Whatever.

88
00:06:58,986 --> 00:07:00,888
<i>Just pull that one back,</i>

89
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:03,491
<i>and you'll see
a, um, soda can tab.</i>

90
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:05,058
<i>It's got a fishing line
tied to it.</i>

91
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:06,460
Follow that line,

92
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:08,228
it'll take you
to an old water line,

93
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,963
and just keep pulling
the string,

94
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,965
<i>and you'll get what I promised.</i>

95
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:12,492
<i>Okay.</i>

96
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:13,894
Great. Was it all there?

97
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:15,896
I mean, the rats
didn't eat it or anything?

98
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:17,197
<i>It's all here.</i>

99
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:23,971
Okay, well, uh,
tell me, how hot?

100
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:25,939
How hot?

101
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:26,874
<i>Yeah.</i>

102
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,743
Well... I still get followed.

103
00:08:29,877 --> 00:08:32,379
Not as often as when
the shit first hit the fan,

104
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,347
but I still see them.

105
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:38,185
My mail gets opened.

106
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:42,122
My phone at home clicks
whenever I use it.

107
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:45,192
So the maestro buying the farm,
it didn't change anything?

108
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:47,728
<i>No. If anything,
it made it worse.</i>

109
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,396
Skyler White got her deal.

110
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,531
So the only ones left
to go after

111
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:52,900
are you and Pinkman.

112
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,678
And I heard they found his car
down by the border,

113
00:08:54,702 --> 00:08:57,404
so, <i>adios,</i> dopehead.

114
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,239
Oh, so they're still into me.

115
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:03,977
Well...

116
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:05,831
Hey, what do you know
about the nail salons?

117
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:07,414
<i>Nail salons are gone.</i>

118
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,717
Wha... Gone? All of them?

119
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:10,850
<i>Yep.</i>

120
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:13,520
What about the vending machines?

121
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:15,022
<i>- Gone.</i>
- Jesus!

122
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:18,525
Ah, don't tell me... Laser tag?

123
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:20,093
Feds found it all, Saul.

124
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:21,528
<i>But how?</i>

125
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:24,031
<i>It was shells within shells!</i>

126
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:25,164
<i>Damn it!</i>

127
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:27,034
Damn it, okay...

128
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:29,468
Okay.

129
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:32,940
Hey, oh, what if...

130
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,542
Let's say there was
an overseas account,

131
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:37,577
um, Antigua and Barbuda...

132
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:39,546
Tigerfish Corporation?

133
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,649
<i>- What?</i>
- Tigerfish Corporation?

134
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:44,051
$850k? I gave it to the feds.

135
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:46,319
You did what?
Why would you do that?

136
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:47,453
<i>Time has expired.</i>

137
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:49,089
God damn it!

138
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:50,533
<i>- Please deposit...
- You... You put my name</i>

139
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:52,259
<i>on the board
of a fictional corporation.</i>

140
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:54,270
I had to give it up.
I didn't really have a choice.

141
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:56,930
A-And a heads up
would've been nice, by the way.

142
00:09:58,065 --> 00:10:00,400
<i>So it's gone?</i>

143
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:01,969
<i>It's all gone?</i>

144
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,937
Those sons of bitches
took everything.

145
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:05,605
<i>Except what you took with you.</i>

146
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:07,875
<i>And I'm guessing
that wasn't chump change.</i>

147
00:10:09,777 --> 00:10:11,144
Yeah. Well...

148
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:14,146
Well.

149
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,484
Guess that's it. <i>- Wait, wait, wait.</i>

150
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,186
Come on,
I just put more quarters in.

151
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:22,155
Can't you just, I don't know,

152
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:23,791
gimme the lowdown.

153
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:24,992
<i>There's nothing else.</i>

154
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,293
Well, that's not true.

155
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:28,461
After all this time? Come on.

156
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:30,097
Just fill me in.

157
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:34,101
What... Um, how's Kuby?

158
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:36,636
No idea.

159
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:37,905
<i>All right, how about Huell?</i>

160
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,708
Huell.

161
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:43,677
I guess back home
in New Orleans.

162
00:10:43,811 --> 00:10:45,813
DEA held him under
false pretenses or something,

163
00:10:45,946 --> 00:10:47,781
so last I heard, he walked.

164
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:52,019
Good. Um, how about Danny?

165
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,254
Or, uh, or Ira?

166
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:55,747
I mean,
any word on those two guys?

167
00:10:57,024 --> 00:10:59,026
<i>They have Internet
where you are?</i>

168
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:02,329
Well, just, come on,
give me something.

169
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:03,964
There's gotta be some news.

170
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:09,269
Uh, remember Bill Oakley?

171
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:10,537
He switched sides.

172
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:13,040
He came out, huh?

173
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,674
<i>No, he's not gay.</i>

174
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:16,043
He's a defense attorney now.

175
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,177
<i>Huh.</i>

176
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:22,015
Well, I mean, what about you?

177
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:23,450
How are you doin'?

178
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:24,885
<i>Oh, I'm just great.</i>

179
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,120
Prince Rainier proposed.

180
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:30,590
The private jet is taking us
to the palace on Thursday.

181
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:33,526
<i>Yeah. Okay.</i>

182
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,329
<i>Well, I guess that's it, then.</i>

183
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:45,038
I did get one call.

184
00:11:45,172 --> 00:11:46,339
After everything went down.

185
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,376
<i>Kim.</i>

186
00:11:51,812 --> 00:11:52,880
<i>Checking in on me.</i>

187
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:56,016
No kidding?

188
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:57,884
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

189
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,188
<i>Your name came up.</i>

190
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:04,024
<i>Asked if you were alive.</i>

191
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:06,193
She asked about me?

192
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,498
What did you tell her?

193
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:12,665
Nothing.

194
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:15,102
<i>But she asked?</i>

195
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,235
Yep.

196
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:27,080
Oh, okay. Well...

197
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:29,216
Uh, I guess...

198
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,119
this is goodbye.

199
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,221
Hello? Hello?

200
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:36,283
Hi, I need a number in Florida.

201
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:37,484
Titusville.

202
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:40,120
Palm Coast Sprinklers.

203
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:43,656
It's on a road, um...

204
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,994
It's named after a fish.

205
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:48,127
Uh...

206
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:51,064
Tarpon Road, right.

207
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:54,034
Uh, well, can you
put me through? I'll...

208
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,535
Say again, how much?

209
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:56,668
Okay.

210
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:12,685
Hi.

211
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:16,823
I'm looking for Kim Wexler.

212
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:18,325
I believe she works there.

213
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,994
Oh.

214
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:03,130
Another good one.

215
00:16:03,263 --> 00:16:05,432
Oh, hey, Jeffie!
Look what the cat dragged in!

216
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:08,635
Hey. Hey, Gene.

217
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:10,046
Yeah. Your mom
was just showing me

218
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,338
this computer you bought her.

219
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:12,872
Yeah, well, he...
he got it for me,

220
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:15,608
and I didn't know what the
hell to do with it, but, uh,

221
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:17,144
look, Gene showed me.

222
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:19,946
- You... You go to the box up here...
- Mm-hmm.

223
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,449
And then you type in
"funny cat videos."

224
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:25,385
I mean, that's it,
just "funny cat videos."

225
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:29,022
These funny
cat videos just pop up!

226
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:30,357
Look at this one. Look, look.

227
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,459
Cat eating an ice cream.

228
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:34,027
Can you believe it?

229
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:35,995
It's like <i>America's</i>
<i>Funniest Home Videos,</i>

230
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:37,430
but you get to be the host.

231
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:39,699
Ooh, wouldn't that be something?

232
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,568
Wow.

233
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:44,737
Hey, uh, Jeffie, get some glasses,
and we can pour the ol' Schnapps, huh?

234
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:45,871
Yeah.

235
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:51,678
I thought a computer would be
good for her, you know?

236
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:54,681
It was on sale.

237
00:16:57,317 --> 00:16:59,919
Not a... big buy at all.

238
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,856
Well, I think it's great.

239
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,326
Treat your mom right,
that's what I say.

240
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:07,694
- Hey, Marion...
- Hmm?

241
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:10,497
How about, uh,
we leave you to the cat videos,

242
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:14,033
and Jeff and I
take our drink to go?

243
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:16,503
I mean, is that car running?
I'd love to take a gander.

244
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:18,904
Come on.

245
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:22,841
Okay.

246
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,922
I swear, the computer's
the one big thing I bought,

247
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,590
and it's not even that much.

248
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:40,059
It's a... it's an old model
on discount.

249
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:41,404
And nobody
said nothing to nobody.

250
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:42,595
N-not me, not Buddy.

251
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:46,842
Living our lives like normal,
just like you said.

252
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:48,235
- Stop talking.
- But I want to...

253
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:50,370
Jeff. Stop talking.

254
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:51,903
I need you to answer
some questions.

255
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:54,941
First up, you have
a night shift, right?

256
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,409
You mean the graveyard shift?

257
00:17:56,543 --> 00:17:59,045
At the cab company? Yeah.

258
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:00,179
What are the hours?

259
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:04,751
They got a 9:00-to-6:00,
a midnight-to-9:00.

260
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:07,720
- Why?
- Get on the 9:00-to-6:00.

261
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:10,557
After that, we need to get
our hands on some barbiturates.

262
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:12,991
What?

263
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:15,395
You're shitting me?

264
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,565
What're we gonna do with them?

265
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:23,903
But you said we're done.

266
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:27,207
You said, "Cross to
the other side of the street"

267
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,575
if I see you coming.

268
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,785
So we're back in business?

269
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:43,923

Wow.

289
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:45,818

Well.

292
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,560
That must've been
what it would be like

293
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,695
if you watched
the <i>Hindenburg</i> go down.

294
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:57,664
But worse, am I right?

295
00:19:57,797 --> 00:20:00,300
- Yeah, well, with gusto, right?
- Gusto.

296
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:04,604
- A bet's a bet.
- With gusto!

297
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:06,739
Hey, what do you say
we go again?

298
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:08,007
Up the stakes?

299
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,918
Loser has to sing
with his shirt off this time...

300
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:11,678
No, no, no. No more bets, okay?

301
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:13,980
Come on,
I haven't been right once.

302
00:20:14,113 --> 00:20:16,383
Aw, what's the matter,
wittle fella,

303
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:18,251
you haven't been wight once?

304
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:19,686
Not once?

305
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:21,454
Hey, can we get more peanuts?

306
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:25,191
Come on, Viktor!

307
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:26,559
Don't be a wuss.

308
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:28,094
I'm not a wuss.

309
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,696
That's right. You're not.

310
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:33,600
You... You gotta believe
in yourself, little buddy.

311
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,913
Let's do one more bet.
One more bet. One more bet.

312
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:39,848
- No. No more.
- Come on, come on. Come on, come on.

313
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:41,149
No more lemon wedges on my nose,

314
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:43,410
no more trick coins,
no more toothpick puzzles.

315
00:20:43,543 --> 00:20:45,578
I, I'm not good at this.

316
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:46,712
Viktor.

317
00:20:47,514 --> 00:20:48,715
This is an easy one.

318
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:55,087
Now, you grab the hundo
before I do,

319
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:56,889
you get to keep it.

320
00:20:57,023 --> 00:21:00,226
I grab the hundo first,
you buy another round.

321
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:04,831
Only rule is,
you can't move until I move.

322
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:08,234
Yeah, but I'm...
I'm so much closer to it.

323
00:21:08,368 --> 00:21:09,736
It's like giving me the money.

324
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:12,305
So you want to take the bet?

325
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,742
Yeah, I'll take it.

326
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,282
Oh, son of a bitch!

327
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:24,751
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!

328
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:27,754
You lose, sucker.

329
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:31,458
Another round, good man,

330
00:21:31,591 --> 00:21:34,894
once again
courtesy of my little friend.

331
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:37,530
All right, all right.

332
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:40,333
Aw. You're fun.

333
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:45,338
<i>Gracias.</i>

334
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:56,315
Ah-di-di-di-da-da-
da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

335
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:03,490
You know,
you're all right, Viktor.

336
00:22:03,623 --> 00:22:05,792
Yeah, I just wish
I knew how you did it.

337
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:10,797
Well, you see,
I'm a man of many talents.

338
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:14,701
And you are a man of very few.

339
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,202
Kidding!

340
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,204
Kidding. Maybe.

341
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,509
Ah.

342
00:22:22,642 --> 00:22:25,378
Every time, every time,
she'll never see it coming.

343
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:27,179
Yeah.

344
00:22:27,313 --> 00:22:28,915
Shh... Yeah...

345
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:30,517
I need some night air.

346
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:31,818
Well.

347
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:34,721
Easy.

348
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,956
Looks like
one of our cabs is here.

349
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:39,892
Ohh. I'll bet you for it.

350
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:42,161
No bets.

351
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:43,596
Come on, now, hear me out.

352
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:44,564
It's simple.

353
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,232
Don't be such a pussy, baby.

354
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,536
Look...

355
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:50,803
What?

356
00:22:50,937 --> 00:22:53,072
Simple as simple can be.

357
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,966
Balance this book of matches on the
back of your hand for ten seconds.

358
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:58,344
That's it, and the cab's yours.

359
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:00,447
I'll even pay for it.

360
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,220
You're just gonna punch me
or something...

361
00:23:02,281 --> 00:23:05,485
No, I promise.
My hands won't touch your body.

362
00:23:05,618 --> 00:23:07,587
And I won't blow it off
the back of your hand.

363
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,720
Really?

364
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:14,360
My body will not touch your body

365
00:23:14,494 --> 00:23:15,494
or the matches.

366
00:23:16,262 --> 00:23:17,262
Fine.

367
00:23:17,363 --> 00:23:18,603
- Huh?
- I gotta win one, right?

368
00:23:18,698 --> 00:23:20,433
All right.

369
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:21,868
That's right, you do.

370
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:23,001
Okay, now.

371
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:25,370
Count with me.

372
00:23:26,105 --> 00:23:27,774
Ten...

373
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:30,477
- Nine, eight...
- Nine, eight...

374
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:33,079
Jesus! Jesus!

375
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:34,881
Loser!

376
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,152
I'll see you around
next time, pal.

377
00:23:40,286 --> 00:23:41,286
This was fun!

378
00:23:42,722 --> 00:23:44,323
Oh, and, Viktor,

379
00:23:45,725 --> 00:23:46,893
you can keep the matches.

380
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:51,063

387
00:25:06,773 --> 00:25:08,174
Yeah. I'm fine.

388
00:25:08,307 --> 00:25:12,211
Got a lotta booze
and, uh, nuts in my mouth.

389
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,549
I got water here, if you want.

390
00:25:16,683 --> 00:25:17,683
On the house.

391
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,480
<i>Car 357, what's your status?</i>

392
00:25:31,798 --> 00:25:34,533
Yeah, car 357,

393
00:25:34,667 --> 00:25:36,535
I'm about ten minutes away
from my drop

394
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:39,038
at, uh, 17 Del Mar Place.

395
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,309
357, head to the airport
when you're done.

396
00:25:43,442 --> 00:25:45,511
<i>Copy that.</i>

397
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:15,875
You doing okay, sir?

398
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,780
Yeah. I'm fine.

399
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:32,424
Hey, you can go.

400
00:26:33,392 --> 00:26:35,427
I'm not giving you another tip.

401
00:26:36,562 --> 00:26:37,630
No problem, sir.

402
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:46,773
Feel better.

403
00:32:08,027 --> 00:32:10,729
What the hell is this?

404
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:14,133
It's like James Whale's
travelling road show in here.

405
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:15,667
Whoever the hell that is.

406
00:32:15,801 --> 00:32:17,201
The Crystal Ship
definitely travels.

407
00:32:19,238 --> 00:32:22,374
I'm sorry,
you said the "what" travels?

408
00:32:22,508 --> 00:32:24,943
Crystal Ship.
It's what I call this thing.

409
00:32:25,077 --> 00:32:28,114
All right. Never mind.
Just... No details.

410
00:32:28,247 --> 00:32:30,225
We're paying him to do a job,
let's just leave it at that.

411
00:32:30,249 --> 00:32:32,118
No details? Fellas, that...

412
00:32:32,251 --> 00:32:33,428
That money you put in my pocket,

413
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:35,254
that doesn't
just extend to this job.

414
00:32:35,387 --> 00:32:37,189
That will get you
attorney-client privilege

415
00:32:37,323 --> 00:32:38,790
on, on all matters.

416
00:32:38,924 --> 00:32:40,092
No. Details.

417
00:32:40,226 --> 00:32:41,760
Look at this set-up.

418
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:44,663
I... What, you two drive
around like Mister Softee,

419
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,932
scooping out drugs for all
the good boys and girls?

420
00:32:47,066 --> 00:32:48,186
No, we don't deal from here.

421
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:50,836
I said, "No details."

422
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,671
Dude is standing
in front of a meth lab.

423
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,249
It's not like he ain't gonna
put two and two together.

424
00:32:54,273 --> 00:32:56,342
He is on a need-to-know basis.

425
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:58,244
Oh. I didn't wanna
show my face.

426
00:32:58,377 --> 00:33:00,279
Did he need to know that?

427
00:33:00,412 --> 00:33:02,214
So, you're not
just distribution.

428
00:33:02,348 --> 00:33:04,783
You're the whole
freakin' package.

429
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:10,289
You two
actually make the blue stuff.

430
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:13,458
Here?

431
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,462
That's amazing.

432
00:33:17,363 --> 00:33:18,997
Can you not touch...

433
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:20,566
I mean, look at this.

434
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:23,069
I had a fish that could've used
this as a vacation home.

435
00:33:23,202 --> 00:33:26,004
But you're using it
to make the goods, huh?

436
00:33:26,138 --> 00:33:28,340
Yeah. That's a, uh,
round-bottom flask.

437
00:33:28,474 --> 00:33:31,043
- Mm.
- Right?

438
00:33:31,777 --> 00:33:32,777
Round-bottom?

439
00:33:35,381 --> 00:33:37,849
It's a flask for distilling.

440
00:33:37,983 --> 00:33:39,651
It won't be if you break it.

441
00:33:39,785 --> 00:33:41,487
Now, please, put it down.

442
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,688
Oh.

443
00:33:42,821 --> 00:33:47,226
Okay, so,
if you cook the blue stuff,

444
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:48,603
then that means
you're Igor and...

445
00:33:48,627 --> 00:33:49,995
And that makes you...

446
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:52,898
You're Heisenberg.

447
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:54,865
Wow.

448
00:33:56,235 --> 00:33:57,903
Hey, tell me, how...

449
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,356
How much product can you churn
out with a set-up like this?

450
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:02,341
No, we're done.
We're done with the questions.

451
00:34:02,474 --> 00:34:04,910
Mm. <i>- We</i> ask the questions.

452
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,879
You have a job, one job,

453
00:34:08,013 --> 00:34:09,348
and I still don't understand

454
00:34:09,481 --> 00:34:10,658
how you're going to pull it off.

455
00:34:10,682 --> 00:34:12,194
Listen, when I get
all my ducks in a row,

456
00:34:12,218 --> 00:34:14,253
I'll give you a PowerPoint
down at the office.

457
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,798
But until then, just... just
bring what we talked about, okay?

458
00:34:16,822 --> 00:34:19,091
And don't worry,
I'm gonna make it work.

459
00:34:19,225 --> 00:34:20,426
I'm taking the $80,000

460
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:23,061
as a starting point
for negotiation.

461
00:34:23,195 --> 00:34:25,531
Take it any way you want,
that's the price.

462
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,699
And, uh...
I'm callin' shotgun.

463
00:34:33,172 --> 00:34:34,172
I will drive.

464
00:34:35,374 --> 00:34:39,945
Oh, yeah, sure,
I'll just stand, I guess.

465
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,513
Dick.

466
00:34:41,647 --> 00:34:43,115
At least you won't be
rolling around

467
00:34:43,249 --> 00:34:44,516
like the last Christmas ham

468
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:45,960
in the back
of the delivery truck.

469
00:34:45,984 --> 00:34:47,119
You know, I...

470
00:34:47,253 --> 00:34:48,754
I've got bad knees.

471
00:34:48,887 --> 00:34:51,123
Think you might've
messed up my rotator cuff.

472
00:34:51,257 --> 00:34:53,425
You're lucky I'm not charging
you for my chiropractor.

473
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:54,826
She's expensive.

474
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,062
But she adjusts everything.

475
00:35:01,467 --> 00:35:03,101
Damn it.

476
00:35:03,235 --> 00:35:04,679
You gotta give it some gas
when you're backing up.

477
00:35:04,703 --> 00:35:07,406
I gave it
the proper amount of gas.

478
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:08,850
I guess that's why
we're moving, then.

479
00:35:08,874 --> 00:35:10,976
Look, it just was idling
too long.

480
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,744
It'll start.

481
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:15,547
Oh, you shoulda
just let me drive, yo.

482
00:35:15,681 --> 00:35:17,716
Look, nothing would be
different in this moment

483
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:19,951
except you panicking
and flooding the engine.

484
00:35:20,085 --> 00:35:21,587
Bullshit.

485
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,955
Fellas, I was enjoying
the Laurel and Hardy vibe,

486
00:35:24,089 --> 00:35:25,991
but I'm not such a fan
of the Bickersons.

487
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,294
Now, can you get me
back to my office?

488
00:35:28,427 --> 00:35:30,962
I, I got work to do if you
want me to make some magic.

489
00:35:31,096 --> 00:35:33,299
We just need to sit a moment.

490
00:35:33,432 --> 00:35:34,700
That's all.

491
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:38,003
When it idles too long,
the fuel pump overheats,

492
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,105
and so we just need
to let it cool down.

493
00:36:14,072 --> 00:36:15,072
So.

494
00:36:15,974 --> 00:36:17,008
Who's Lalo?

495
00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:20,111
Who?

496
00:36:20,246 --> 00:36:21,880
Lalo.

497
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,649
You thought some dude
named Lalo sent us.

498
00:36:23,782 --> 00:36:25,551
You seemed pretty freaked out.

499
00:36:26,952 --> 00:36:28,654
Never heard of no Lalo
on the street.

500
00:36:32,057 --> 00:36:33,425
It's nobody.

501
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:37,563
Hey, are you gonna
try that again, 'cause...

502
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:39,974
Or are they gonna find us,
you know, buried in a sandstorm

503
00:36:39,998 --> 00:36:41,066
a thousand years from now?

504
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,199
Just please.

505
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:57,182
Bravo.

506
00:36:57,316 --> 00:36:58,950
I second that.

507
00:36:59,084 --> 00:37:02,087
And let me give you
two free words of advice.

550
00:41:57,482 --> 00:41:58,482
You wanna know my trick?

551
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:01,319
Play your own game,

552
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:03,631
don't get caught up with
what the other guys are buying.

553
00:42:03,655 --> 00:42:04,489
Mm-hmm.

554
00:42:04,623 --> 00:42:06,057
Like the man says,

555
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:09,194
you never know who's swimming
nude until the tide goes out.

556
00:42:09,327 --> 00:42:11,997
I guess.

557
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:14,532
But, I mean,
with this financial stuff,

558
00:42:14,666 --> 00:42:16,267
it feels like
the game is rigged.

559
00:42:16,401 --> 00:42:17,669
The big guys always win.

560
00:42:17,803 --> 00:42:19,104
Well...

561
00:42:19,237 --> 00:42:21,907
I wish I could disagree
with you, Viktor, but I can't.

562
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,975
There is definitely dishonesty.

563
00:42:24,109 --> 00:42:28,346
But the majority, I believe,
are straight shooters.

564
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:31,016
Now, the...
the folks responsible

565
00:42:31,149 --> 00:42:32,718
for, uh,

566
00:42:32,851 --> 00:42:34,920
Enron, WorldCom...

567
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:37,022
Madoff and his ilk...

568
00:42:37,155 --> 00:42:38,924
Mm.

569
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:40,735
I gotta believe
there's a special place in Hell

570
00:42:40,759 --> 00:42:41,759
for those people.

571
00:42:41,827 --> 00:42:42,827
Yeah.

572
00:42:44,696 --> 00:42:48,433
But in my experience,
that's the exception.

573
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:53,371
Y-You can't let a few bad apples
spoil it for the rest of us.

574
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:55,373
In fact...

575
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:56,742
Sorry.

576
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:11,723
Those look exotic.

577
00:43:12,758 --> 00:43:14,425
I-I went through that phase.

578
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:16,427
I took every vitamin there was.

579
00:43:16,561 --> 00:43:19,064
Hey, guess how many pills I took

580
00:43:19,197 --> 00:43:20,441
to try to keep the hair
on my head.

581
00:43:20,465 --> 00:43:21,967
Worked like a charm.

582
00:43:23,301 --> 00:43:24,302
What are those for?

583
00:43:27,005 --> 00:43:28,573
Cancer.

584
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:32,577
Oh.

585
00:43:32,711 --> 00:43:33,711
Sorry.

586
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:36,380
Uh.

587
00:43:37,916 --> 00:43:41,086
Uh, is it, uh... is it bad?

588
00:43:41,987 --> 00:43:43,147
Well, it ain't the good kind.

589
00:43:45,423 --> 00:43:47,926
Come on. More drinks.
This one's on me.

590
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:49,099
Get two more here, please?

591
00:43:55,166 --> 00:43:56,486
Hey, uh,
it's none of my business,

592
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:57,567
but, um...

593
00:43:58,603 --> 00:44:00,105
should you be drinkin'?

594
00:44:06,812 --> 00:44:08,346
You only go around once.

595
00:44:12,417 --> 00:44:13,417
You got that right.

596
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,476
You sure you don't want to
take this one, Vik?

597
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:39,644
I can wait.

598
00:44:39,778 --> 00:44:40,946
No. It's all you.

599
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:42,147
Ah, okay.

600
00:45:26,024 --> 00:45:27,425
Feed me, what do we got?

601
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:28,918
<i>You remember
to take your fish oil?</i>

602
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:29,761
I did. <i>- B-12?</i>

603
00:45:29,895 --> 00:45:31,362
Did it. <i>- L-arginine?</i>

604
00:45:31,496 --> 00:45:33,231
Got 'em all. Next.

605
00:45:33,364 --> 00:45:35,642
<i>You're supposed to file that
appellate brief for Hemple by 4:00.</i>

606
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:37,836
Crap. Um, hey,

607
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:40,839
could you put down the travel
magazine and help with that?

608
00:45:40,972 --> 00:45:42,040
<i>Not a paralegal, Saul.</i>

609
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:45,310
<i>Anyway, your 12:30
just walked in.</i>

610
00:45:45,443 --> 00:45:46,644
Aces. Send him in.

611
00:45:48,046 --> 00:45:49,948
Oh! Enter, Sunshine.

612
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:52,583
Cast some light
into my cold, dark world.

613
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:10,936
Hello?
You're on the clock, right?

614
00:46:11,069 --> 00:46:13,304
So give with the info anytime.

615
00:46:13,438 --> 00:46:14,940
When you're done.

616
00:46:15,073 --> 00:46:16,307
No, I can multitask, please.

617
00:46:18,076 --> 00:46:20,178
I'm not gonna talk to you
while you're on...

618
00:46:20,311 --> 00:46:23,014
whatever that is.

619
00:46:23,148 --> 00:46:25,984
You know, LBJ used to have
his underlings give him reports

620
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:27,618
while he was on the shitter.

621
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:30,088
Uh-huh.

622
00:46:30,221 --> 00:46:33,624
Well, either I'm gonna leave,

623
00:46:33,758 --> 00:46:36,261
or I'm gonna put my foot
in your skull.

624
00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:39,430
Fine.

625
00:46:43,101 --> 00:46:44,602
But you should try one of these.

626
00:46:45,736 --> 00:46:47,805
You walk like Frankenstein

627
00:46:47,939 --> 00:46:49,975
after he was probed by aliens.

628
00:46:50,108 --> 00:46:52,310
I can get you one.

629
00:46:52,443 --> 00:46:55,346
It would do wonders
for your chi.

630
00:46:59,084 --> 00:47:00,785
Let's go, lay it on me.

631
00:47:05,924 --> 00:47:07,292
All right. First.

632
00:47:08,759 --> 00:47:10,996
There's your
Mrs. Denise Gabler.

633
00:47:11,129 --> 00:47:12,297
She's cheating, all right.

634
00:47:14,132 --> 00:47:16,101
Limber.

635
00:47:16,234 --> 00:47:17,903
Ha-ha!

636
00:47:18,036 --> 00:47:20,171
Well, at least I know
they didn't spot you.

637
00:47:20,305 --> 00:47:21,572
No one could stay that aroused

638
00:47:21,706 --> 00:47:23,308
with your mug
peeking through the window.

639
00:47:26,111 --> 00:47:27,712
What else you got?

640
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:30,048
Well, next,
I followed your bus driver.

641
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:32,717
News flash. He really
does have a broken neck.

642
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:35,220
Fantastic.

643
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:37,388
That makes my life much easier.

644
00:47:37,522 --> 00:47:38,689
Keep it coming.

645
00:47:38,823 --> 00:47:40,491
Second story guy
out of Indianapolis.

646
00:47:40,625 --> 00:47:43,361
Lasky. Did a dime at Menard.

647
00:47:43,494 --> 00:47:44,854
Now, if you're looking
for a talent

648
00:47:44,963 --> 00:47:46,864
who'll keep his mouth shut,
you can trust him.

649
00:47:46,998 --> 00:47:49,167
I say he's worth
keeping an eye on.

650
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,069
Second story guy,
second story guy.

651
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:53,538
I got... I got more
second story guys in my book

652
00:47:53,671 --> 00:47:55,706
than pimples at a Junior prom.

653
00:47:58,309 --> 00:48:01,346
What about, uh,
that Heisenberg fella?

654
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:05,150
High school chemistry teacher.

655
00:48:06,051 --> 00:48:08,086
You're shittin' me. Really?

656
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:10,155
Walter Hartwell White.

657
00:48:10,288 --> 00:48:13,058
Chemistry teacher
over at JP Wynne.

658
00:48:13,191 --> 00:48:15,660
Working with a former student,
current meth head,

659
00:48:15,793 --> 00:48:16,861
one Jesse Pinkman.

660
00:48:16,995 --> 00:48:17,995
Wow.

661
00:48:19,064 --> 00:48:21,099
Uh, what else about the teacher?

662
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:23,234
He has lung cancer.

663
00:48:24,202 --> 00:48:25,270
Jesus.

664
00:48:27,205 --> 00:48:28,974
That's why he can't quit
with the coughing.

665
00:48:30,041 --> 00:48:31,076
How bad?

666
00:48:31,209 --> 00:48:32,910
Stage Three A.

667
00:48:33,044 --> 00:48:34,912
He's in treatment,
more tests to come,

668
00:48:35,046 --> 00:48:36,581
but it doesn't look good.

669
00:48:36,714 --> 00:48:38,474
Now, listen, even if
this guy was gonna live,

670
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:39,917
I wouldn't go near him.

671
00:48:40,051 --> 00:48:41,386
He's a complete amateur.

672
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:43,554
Well, you see an amateur.

673
00:48:43,688 --> 00:48:47,592
I see...
170 pounds of clay ready to be molded.

674
00:48:47,725 --> 00:48:49,527
Well, if the cancer
doesn't get him,

675
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:51,796
it'll be the cops
or a bullet to the head.

676
00:48:53,698 --> 00:48:55,967
Is that your appraisal
or is that what

677
00:48:56,101 --> 00:48:58,569
"He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named"
says about him?

678
00:48:58,703 --> 00:49:01,672
He doesn't say anything.
The guy's small potatoes.

679
00:49:01,806 --> 00:49:03,308
Yeah, okay. I hear you.

680
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:04,809
I just...

681
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:06,777
I got a feeling about this.

682
00:49:06,911 --> 00:49:09,447
This Heisenberg guy's
got something.

683
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:12,317
It's top of the line product,
that's the buzz on the street,

684
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:13,694
and I just think,
with the right management...

685
00:49:13,718 --> 00:49:15,987
You know, years ago,
I bought a Betamax.

686
00:49:16,121 --> 00:49:17,588
Good product.
"Top of the line."

687
00:49:17,722 --> 00:49:21,059
Experts said
it was better than a VHS.

688
00:49:21,192 --> 00:49:24,195
Turned out to be a complete
waste of time and money.

689
00:49:24,329 --> 00:49:25,329
Hmm?

690
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:26,963
Let it go.

691
00:49:29,434 --> 00:49:31,469
Guy with that mustache

692
00:49:31,602 --> 00:49:33,538
probably doesn't make
a lot of good life choices.

693
00:49:33,671 --> 00:49:36,641
So, yeah, uh,
the second story guy.

694
00:49:36,774 --> 00:49:39,110
- Uh, Menard, you said?
- Yeah, right, right, right.

695
00:49:40,745 --> 00:49:42,580
All right,
part of a high-end crew

696
00:49:42,713 --> 00:49:44,815
fencing jewelry up into Canada.

697
00:49:46,551 --> 00:49:48,653
Now, the Lasky kid
caught a bad break.

698
00:49:48,786 --> 00:49:51,322
The cop was driving by just
as he was ducking in a window.

699
00:49:52,557 --> 00:49:54,292
He did the time,

700
00:49:54,425 --> 00:49:58,496
no one else on his crew
went down. Solid.

701
00:49:58,629 --> 00:50:01,132
<i>Known for their vast migration
patterns through Africa,</i>

702
00:50:01,266 --> 00:50:02,833
<i>nearly two million wildebeests</i>

703
00:50:02,967 --> 00:50:04,802
<i>travel 2,000 miles each year...</i>

704
00:50:06,537 --> 00:50:09,140
<i>making their migration
one of the greatest on Earth.</i>

705
00:50:13,211 --> 00:50:15,822
<i>The herd seeks fresh grass, following
the rain through Kenya and Tanzania.</i>

706
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:19,450
<i>Gathering each year
to prepare for the journey,</i>

707
00:50:19,584 --> 00:50:22,853
<i>one that's been taking place
for a million years.</i>

708
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:26,324
<i>The voyage is not easy.</i>

709
00:50:26,457 --> 00:50:31,096
<i>While traveling, the herd
must stay well fed, rested</i>

710
00:50:31,229 --> 00:50:34,765
<i>and free of disease
or be left behi...</i>

711
00:50:34,899 --> 00:50:37,535
<i>Couple more.
And shuffle, ladies.</i>

712
00:50:39,237 --> 00:50:40,371
<i>Just like that.</i>

713
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:43,708
<i>Now I step.</i>

714
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:47,145
<i>Four times.</i>

715
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:50,815
<i>Fabulous!</i>

716
00:50:50,948 --> 00:50:52,883
<i>Let me see you having fun.</i>

717
00:50:53,017 --> 00:50:54,051
Yeah.

718
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:58,089
W... Uh.

719
00:50:58,223 --> 00:50:59,223
What do you mean?

720
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,160
He what?

721
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:09,700
Tell... Tell him to get his ass
back to the garage right now.

722
00:51:14,205 --> 00:51:15,706
You cutie-patootie.

723
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:21,412
You think you've seen
everything.

724
00:51:44,235 --> 00:51:46,971
Shut that goddamn dog up
and get back in here.

725
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:51,841
Get in.

726
00:51:56,247 --> 00:51:59,116
You're kidding me.
You're absolutely kidding me.

727
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:00,410
I'm sorry, man. I couldn't...

728
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:02,287
Do you know how much time,
how much effort,

729
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:04,289
I put into finding
the perfect mark?

730
00:52:04,422 --> 00:52:06,090
I have to weed through
all these saps

731
00:52:06,224 --> 00:52:08,693
who have wives
and families at home,

732
00:52:08,826 --> 00:52:10,761
find somebody
who's alone with money,

733
00:52:10,895 --> 00:52:13,498
and, what,
so you can just wimp out?

734
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:14,999
The guy has cancer, man.

735
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:17,302
I found pills in his pocket.

736
00:52:17,435 --> 00:52:19,170
Okay? The same ones
my dad took.

737
00:52:19,304 --> 00:52:20,464
For, like, pancreatic cancer.

738
00:52:20,538 --> 00:52:22,740
So? A guy with cancer
can't be an asshole?

739
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:25,776
Believe me,
I speak from experience.

740
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:28,246
I can't rip off a guy
with cancer. I'm sorry.

741
00:52:28,379 --> 00:52:31,182
Do you know how many of the suckers
we've ripped off have sob stories?

742
00:52:31,316 --> 00:52:32,617
Every single one of them.

743
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:35,119
Besides, it'll be months

744
00:52:35,253 --> 00:52:36,930
before they even realize
they've been taken.

745
00:52:36,954 --> 00:52:38,389
This guy will already be dead.

746
00:52:38,523 --> 00:52:39,833
So, please,
get back in your truck,

747
00:52:39,857 --> 00:52:41,492
go back to the house,
and finish the job.

748
00:52:46,063 --> 00:52:48,633
No, man. I can't do that.

749
00:52:48,766 --> 00:52:49,900
I can't.

750
00:52:50,034 --> 00:52:51,636
Look, all right.
I get it.

751
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:54,171
You get over it, okay?

752
00:52:54,305 --> 00:52:55,773
Please, believe me. Y...

753
00:52:55,906 --> 00:52:58,509
Before you know it,
you forget all about it.

754
00:52:58,643 --> 00:52:59,643
Go.

755
00:53:01,879 --> 00:53:03,881
Well, l-look,
we're doing really well, right?

756
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,934
Hear me out, okay?
I mean, we're rolling in cash.

757
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:08,052
We can just let this one go.

758
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:09,454
Not your call.

759
00:53:09,587 --> 00:53:13,090
Yeah, but I,
I pulled the tape when I left.

760
00:53:13,224 --> 00:53:14,392
The door's locked.

761
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:16,285
We couldn't get back in
even if we wanted to.

762
00:53:18,596 --> 00:53:20,965
Jeff, come on, man,
back me up here.

763
00:53:21,999 --> 00:53:23,401
Huh?

764
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:24,835
Oh, well... I, I don't know.

765
00:53:24,969 --> 00:53:27,838
I mean, I can see
both sides, kinda.

766
00:53:27,972 --> 00:53:29,583
You know, forget it.
You're fired. Just go.

767
00:53:29,607 --> 00:53:30,767
Just gimme the camera and go.

768
00:53:32,176 --> 00:53:33,511
Fine.

769
00:53:33,644 --> 00:53:36,180
Good. Go. We don't need you.

770
00:53:36,314 --> 00:53:37,948
And I know
I don't need to tell you this,

771
00:53:38,082 --> 00:53:39,693
but since you're
such a goddamned amateur,

772
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:41,419
I will anyway.

773
00:53:41,552 --> 00:53:42,753
Keep your mouth shut.

774
00:53:56,534 --> 00:53:58,254
If we're gonna do this,
we should leave now.

775
00:53:59,904 --> 00:54:01,205
We're really
gonna go back there?

776
00:54:02,473 --> 00:54:03,473
What'd I just say?

777
00:54:05,109 --> 00:54:06,109
Jeff, are you in or out?

778
00:54:23,328 --> 00:54:24,328
What?

779
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:27,031
I'm down for this. I am.

780
00:54:27,164 --> 00:54:29,734
- But, uh...
- But what?

781
00:54:29,867 --> 00:54:31,307
What time did the guy
take the drugs?

782
00:54:31,436 --> 00:54:33,438
We gave it to him, what?
Three hours ago?

783
00:54:33,571 --> 00:54:35,105
I don't even know
if he finished it.

784
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:36,273
He might be awake by now.

785
00:54:36,407 --> 00:54:37,908
Don't worry about it.

786
00:54:38,042 --> 00:54:39,344
Yeah, but...

787
00:54:39,477 --> 00:54:40,945
I said don't worry about it.

788
00:54:41,078 --> 00:54:42,078
It'll be fine.

789
00:54:55,626 --> 00:54:56,961
That's it. Right there.

790
00:55:04,101 --> 00:55:06,971
Come back
and get me in 20 minutes.

791
00:55:07,104 --> 00:55:09,173
Just roll up slow,
like you're picking up a fare.

792
00:55:10,441 --> 00:55:12,777
It'll be fine. Relax.
