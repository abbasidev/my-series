1
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,010
Previously
on "Better Call Saul"...

2
00:00:10,053 --> 00:00:12,403
Four for unlock, five for lock.

3
00:00:12,447 --> 00:00:14,144
I gotta tell ya,
it does not sound like

4
00:00:14,188 --> 00:00:16,190
the Howard Hamlin that I know.

5
00:00:16,233 --> 00:00:18,627
You're going to forget you ever
heard the name Howard Hamlin.

6
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:22,022
Lalo is dead.

7
00:00:22,065 --> 00:00:23,806
The DA's office put it together

8
00:00:23,849 --> 00:00:25,982
that Lalo was calling himself
"de Guzman."

9
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,636
What do you think we should do?

10
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:28,854
Do you want to be a friend
of the cartel

11
00:00:28,898 --> 00:00:31,248
or do you want to be a rat?

12
00:00:31,292 --> 00:00:35,992
- What did you learn?
- Lalo Salamanca lives.

13
00:01:40,535 --> 00:01:41,927
Oh, no.

14
00:01:41,971 --> 00:01:43,494
Really?

15
00:01:43,538 --> 00:01:45,714
I thought it'd be just the trim.

16
00:01:45,757 --> 00:01:48,282
Of all the colors,
why would you pick that?

17
00:01:48,325 --> 00:01:52,416
Use adobe red, if you want red.

18
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,679
What do you even call that?

19
00:01:54,723 --> 00:01:57,073
Fire engine red?

20
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,857
Tomato red.

21
00:01:58,901 --> 00:02:00,946
Their poor neighbors.

22
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,253
Mmh. Mmh.

23
00:02:27,973 --> 00:02:31,194
Ugh. What an eyesore.

24
00:02:31,238 --> 00:02:33,327
There's no way
the Homeowners' Association

25
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:36,068
approved that color.

26
00:02:36,112 --> 00:02:38,506
Barb's gonna have a cow.

27
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:39,681
Whew.

28
00:02:39,724 --> 00:02:43,163
Maybe I could put a bug
in her ear...

29
00:02:43,206 --> 00:02:45,208
What can Barb do?

30
00:02:45,252 --> 00:02:47,167
That place isn't even
in Mountain View.

31
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,256
It's Enchantment Hills
over there.

32
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:51,954
Enchantment Hills starts
at Pinon Lane.

33
00:02:51,997 --> 00:02:55,175
Remember when the Westlakes
planted those Quaking Aspens?

34
00:02:55,218 --> 00:02:57,829
That whole mess?

35
00:02:57,873 --> 00:02:59,788
I thought the Westlakes proved

36
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:03,270
their lot was in
Enchantment Hills.

37
00:03:03,313 --> 00:03:05,228
They paid for a land survey.

38
00:03:05,272 --> 00:03:08,013
Really?

39
00:03:08,057 --> 00:03:09,754
Where'd you hear that?

40
00:03:09,798 --> 00:03:12,801
Robbie Davis, maybe.

41
00:03:12,844 --> 00:03:15,499
I'll double-check the map
after I shower.

42
00:03:19,634 --> 00:03:21,375
Want some?

43
00:03:21,418 --> 00:03:22,985
Nah. I'm good.

44
00:03:32,429 --> 00:03:34,649
Is that iced tea?

45
00:03:34,692 --> 00:03:36,999
Mrs. Would you like some?

46
00:03:37,042 --> 00:03:39,654
Love some. Thank you, Ma'am.

47
00:05:13,487 --> 00:05:15,053
How's it going?

48
00:05:15,097 --> 00:05:17,534
Eh. Status quo.

49
00:05:17,578 --> 00:05:20,842
You know, hummin' along.

50
00:05:20,885 --> 00:05:23,975
We did land a pretty big client
last week, though.

51
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:26,369
Insurance outfit in Santa Fe.

52
00:05:26,413 --> 00:05:29,503
They cover most of the high-end
real estate up there.

53
00:05:29,546 --> 00:05:31,331
Great.

54
00:05:32,636 --> 00:05:35,378
But, Howard,
I'm not a shareholder.

55
00:05:35,422 --> 00:05:38,381
I'm... I'm just
getting warmed up.

56
00:05:38,425 --> 00:05:41,297
Although I still think you would
make one hell of litigator.

57
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,126
Ah. Appreciate that,
but I'll pass.

58
00:05:45,997 --> 00:05:49,784
At home, things are
more or less the same.

59
00:05:49,827 --> 00:05:51,786
It's not any worse...

60
00:05:51,829 --> 00:05:53,918
I guess I should be grateful
for that.

61
00:05:55,398 --> 00:05:58,053
It's like we're...

62
00:05:58,096 --> 00:05:59,707
deadlocked.

63
00:06:05,974 --> 00:06:10,021
Cheryl still won't talk about
anything... important.

64
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,938
You tried what we
discussed? Yes.

65
00:06:13,982 --> 00:06:16,724
Yes, Idid, but...

66
00:06:25,123 --> 00:06:27,691
I didhave a dream.

67
00:06:50,497 --> 00:06:52,542
So I look over
the old man's ticket,

68
00:06:52,586 --> 00:06:54,414
and it's clearly
an international flight,

69
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:56,372
so we search for
his gate number...

70
00:06:56,416 --> 00:07:00,115
But all the signs are
in a language I can't read.

71
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,522
Kim!

72
00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:46,395
Any traffic?

73
00:08:46,438 --> 00:08:48,092
Nope. Straight shot down 25.

74
00:08:48,136 --> 00:08:49,833
This is us.

75
00:08:49,877 --> 00:08:51,269
Thanks for meeting me.

76
00:08:51,313 --> 00:08:53,576
I imagine you're swamped
when you're in town.

77
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,578
Today's not too bad.
In fact, I have a meeting

78
00:08:55,622 --> 00:08:57,319
at your old stomping ground,
with Schweikart.

79
00:08:57,362 --> 00:08:59,495
Oh. Tell Rich I said hi.

80
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,323
Of course. How's Jimmy?

81
00:09:01,366 --> 00:09:03,368
He's great. Thanks for asking.

82
00:09:03,412 --> 00:09:05,153
How about Alice? She's doing well.

83
00:09:05,196 --> 00:09:08,765
She's taking up baking,
and, uh, no complaints here.

84
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:11,681
Well, lucky you. Don't I know it.

85
00:09:11,725 --> 00:09:14,162
I hear this place makes
a killer latte. Yeah.

86
00:09:14,205 --> 00:09:17,121
They give Java Joe's a run
for their money, if you ask me.

87
00:09:46,716 --> 00:09:49,980
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Come on!

88
00:09:50,024 --> 00:09:51,199
Had a customer.

89
00:09:51,242 --> 00:09:52,983
Okay, okay, but it's time to go.

90
00:09:53,027 --> 00:09:54,855
C'mon! We gotta get moving!

91
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,425
Wait. What are ya doing?

92
00:10:00,469 --> 00:10:01,731
No, no, no, no, no.
Hey. Come on.

93
00:10:01,775 --> 00:10:04,647
We gotta move. We gotta move.

94
00:10:04,691 --> 00:10:05,822
I'm getting a root beer.

95
00:10:05,866 --> 00:10:07,345
No, no. We have a schedule.

96
00:10:07,389 --> 00:10:08,564
Remember? We discussed it.

97
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,566
I put two quarters in.

98
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,569
I will buy you an entire case
when we're done.

99
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:17,704
Here we go. Right in. Whew.

100
00:10:17,747 --> 00:10:19,749
All the way.

101
00:11:03,314 --> 00:11:04,359
Everything okay?

102
00:11:04,402 --> 00:11:06,100
Sure.

103
00:11:09,016 --> 00:11:10,974
Do we need to go over it again?

104
00:11:11,018 --> 00:11:12,236
Nah.

105
00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:15,544
Well, just remember...

106
00:11:15,587 --> 00:11:16,806
Keep your feet out of the way

107
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:19,722
'cause I'm gonna have to leave
in a hurry.

108
00:11:22,507 --> 00:11:24,074
What?

109
00:11:24,118 --> 00:11:27,251
I really like your hair.

110
00:11:28,513 --> 00:11:30,864
It's not... Thank you.

111
00:11:30,907 --> 00:11:33,475
Thanks.

112
00:11:35,172 --> 00:11:36,957
What if there was
a different way?

113
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,915
What if there was an
independent team of lawyers...

114
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,961
Maybe four or five of them...

115
00:11:41,004 --> 00:11:43,311
Who were dedicated to taking on
the difficult cases?

116
00:11:43,354 --> 00:11:45,835
I'm not saying a few lawyers
can solve

117
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:47,707
a massive, systemic problem,

118
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,666
but they could make it better.

119
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,712
And why come to me with this?

120
00:11:54,409 --> 00:11:56,280
Well, if I wanted
to shine you on,

121
00:11:56,324 --> 00:11:57,586
I'd tell you it's because

122
00:11:57,629 --> 00:11:59,501
you're known for
your social conscience.

123
00:11:59,544 --> 00:12:00,937
But the truth is

124
00:12:00,981 --> 00:12:03,070
it's because of your connections
in state government.

125
00:12:03,113 --> 00:12:04,854
You can make things happen.

126
00:12:04,898 --> 00:12:06,943
Fair enough.

127
00:12:06,987 --> 00:12:10,077
Kim, the firm has
a service committee.

128
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,948
I should tell you to go to them

129
00:12:11,992 --> 00:12:15,604
and get in line with
all the other worthy causes.

130
00:12:15,647 --> 00:12:17,867
But you're putting your money
where your mouth is.

131
00:12:21,392 --> 00:12:24,439
I'm sure you've heard something
about my son's drug problem.

132
00:12:26,223 --> 00:12:28,312
Gregory's struggle
gave me a more, let's say,

133
00:12:28,356 --> 00:12:30,314
personal view
of the legal system.

134
00:12:32,099 --> 00:12:35,885
Kim, I think
you've got something here.

135
00:12:51,901 --> 00:12:53,816
You can't skimp
on the support staff.

136
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,644
They're the beating heart
of the operation.

137
00:12:55,687 --> 00:12:58,299
I know that's true
in our office...

138
00:13:01,606 --> 00:13:03,957
No, no! No! No!

139
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,088
Jesus.

140
00:13:05,132 --> 00:13:07,961
You son of a bitch!

141
00:13:09,266 --> 00:13:12,226
You twisted deadbeat
piece of shit!

142
00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:14,445
Wasn't that... Howard?

143
00:13:14,489 --> 00:13:15,838
God damn it!

144
00:13:15,882 --> 00:13:17,144
You owe me!

145
00:13:17,187 --> 00:13:18,232
Ma'am, are you okay?

146
00:13:18,275 --> 00:13:19,842
You owe me! Ma'am...

147
00:13:19,886 --> 00:13:21,757
I mean... Nobody does that to me!

148
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,977
I don't know.
It happened so fast.

149
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:27,241
Damn it! He owes me!
What a rip-off!

150
00:13:27,284 --> 00:13:28,938
Damn you!

151
00:13:51,047 --> 00:13:53,049
No. No!

152
00:13:53,093 --> 00:13:55,225
They moved the cone?!

153
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:58,968
What kinda asshole
moves a cone?!

154
00:14:00,578 --> 00:14:03,320
Ohh. Crap.

155
00:15:04,729 --> 00:15:05,992
Nngh!

156
00:15:11,258 --> 00:15:12,868
Nngh!

157
00:16:07,183 --> 00:16:10,186
Hey, listen. Um...

158
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,058
Be careful, okay?

159
00:16:13,146 --> 00:16:15,061
Okay.

160
00:16:19,152 --> 00:16:20,153
What?

161
00:16:20,196 --> 00:16:22,155
Five-O.

162
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:24,722
That kills business
for the rest of the day.

163
00:16:25,854 --> 00:16:27,943
Always hassling me.

164
00:16:29,423 --> 00:16:30,990
Undercover cops?

165
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:33,557
Yep.

166
00:16:33,601 --> 00:16:37,779
Well, listen, if you ever have
any legal problems,

167
00:16:37,822 --> 00:16:39,389
give me a call, anytime.

168
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:40,956
No charge.

169
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,655
Thanks.

170
00:17:41,321 --> 00:17:44,237
So I pulled the Jag
into the loading zone

171
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,586
and I start scrapping
with this hunk of metal.

172
00:17:45,629 --> 00:17:47,414
Oh, my God. It was in deep.

173
00:17:47,457 --> 00:17:49,894
Like down-a-well deep.

174
00:17:49,938 --> 00:17:52,462
So I just... wrestled it!

175
00:17:52,506 --> 00:17:54,334
Nngh! Like a freakin' bear!

176
00:17:54,377 --> 00:17:58,555
And I... nngh!... Jam it in
the dirt in front of the Jag.

177
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:00,253
Boom!

178
00:18:00,296 --> 00:18:02,864
Barely made it out of there
by the skin of my teeth.

179
00:18:02,907 --> 00:18:04,909
Who moves cones?!

180
00:18:04,953 --> 00:18:08,130
Who does that? Narcissists.

181
00:18:08,174 --> 00:18:09,653
You're damn right.

182
00:18:12,047 --> 00:18:14,310
So you think
Cliff really bought it, huh?

183
00:18:14,354 --> 00:18:18,271
One hundred percent.
You should have seen his face.

184
00:18:18,314 --> 00:18:19,881
It landed, trust me.

185
00:18:21,665 --> 00:18:25,191
God, it was beautiful.

186
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:29,673
Oh. And that is not all.

187
00:18:29,717 --> 00:18:31,066
Spill.

188
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,938
So, I'm doing the stall,

189
00:18:33,982 --> 00:18:36,071
I'm telling Cliff
what I'm doing,

190
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,464
what I wanna be doing.

191
00:18:37,507 --> 00:18:38,726
All I'm thinking about is

192
00:18:38,769 --> 00:18:40,945
I gotta stretch this out
until you get there.

193
00:18:40,989 --> 00:18:45,341
But then, I don't know,
I kind of got caught up in it.

194
00:18:45,385 --> 00:18:48,344
And then...

195
00:18:48,388 --> 00:18:49,737
Cliff went for it.

196
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:53,915
I mean, like,
really went for it.

197
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:56,135
What does that mean? Like money?

198
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:57,701
I-I don't think
he'll write a check himself.

199
00:18:57,745 --> 00:18:59,747
But he knows people.

200
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,662
And I think he'll deliver.

201
00:19:01,705 --> 00:19:02,924
You're kidding.

202
00:19:02,967 --> 00:19:05,448
I know! How great is that?

203
00:19:05,492 --> 00:19:07,146
This is unbelievable.

204
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:10,714
Are we on a roll
or are we on a roll?

205
00:19:10,758 --> 00:19:14,283
Geez.

206
00:19:19,506 --> 00:19:22,378
You ever feel like
you're being followed?

207
00:19:25,425 --> 00:19:27,688
When I dropped Wendy off
at the motel,

208
00:19:27,731 --> 00:19:30,865
she thought she was being
watched by some undercover cops.

209
00:19:30,908 --> 00:19:33,694
But then, when I drove away,

210
00:19:33,737 --> 00:19:36,175
that same car was behind me.

211
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,917
Right after I spotted them,
they disappeared.

212
00:19:41,963 --> 00:19:44,183
Well, you know what they say.

213
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:48,143
"The wicked flee
when no man pursueth."

214
00:19:50,624 --> 00:19:52,713
You think we're wicked?

215
00:19:52,756 --> 00:19:54,715
No. What?

216
00:19:54,758 --> 00:19:56,369
It's just a turn of phrase.

217
00:19:59,067 --> 00:20:02,113
I think you're wicked hawt.

218
00:20:08,076 --> 00:20:09,338
Alright.

219
00:20:09,382 --> 00:20:12,036
Listen to the voice
of experience, okay?

220
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,996
You know why
you're feeling like this?

221
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,217
Because we got away with it.

222
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,871
It seems too good to be true.

223
00:20:20,915 --> 00:20:24,048
But trust me,
nobody is following you.

224
00:20:25,876 --> 00:20:30,316
No one knows what we're doing
except for us.

225
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:31,969
Okay?

226
00:20:36,017 --> 00:20:37,236
Okay.

227
00:20:39,673 --> 00:20:41,370
I get it.
Under the circumstances,

228
00:20:41,414 --> 00:20:43,546
I wouldn't want to be anywhere
near a police station

229
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,679
if I were you either.

230
00:20:45,722 --> 00:20:47,246
I'll tell you what.

231
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:50,031
Um, the mahogany
in my conference room

232
00:20:50,074 --> 00:20:51,685
is currently getting buffed out,

233
00:20:51,728 --> 00:20:55,341
so I'm using my satellite office
at Juan Tabo and Skyline.

234
00:20:55,384 --> 00:20:58,474
I'm letting a nail salon,
you know, use the lobby,

235
00:20:58,518 --> 00:21:00,476
so my office is in the back.

236
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,436
Meet me there at00.

237
00:21:03,479 --> 00:21:05,612
Great! Thanks.

238
00:21:05,655 --> 00:21:06,830
How's it hanging, Steve-O?

239
00:21:06,874 --> 00:21:09,355
Shoes. Belt. Jacket.

240
00:21:09,398 --> 00:21:10,660
I'm sorry. What?

241
00:21:10,704 --> 00:21:13,837
Shoes. Belt. Jacket.

242
00:21:13,881 --> 00:21:16,057
Seriously? Since when?

243
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,841
It's procedure, sir.

244
00:21:17,885 --> 00:21:19,930
"Sir"?

245
00:21:26,546 --> 00:21:29,070
Why'd Ihit the jackpot?

246
00:21:29,113 --> 00:21:30,637
Never can tell.

247
00:21:39,515 --> 00:21:42,257
Hey. How you doing
on this beautiful day?

248
00:21:44,694 --> 00:21:47,306
Did you, uh, catch
that cookie bouquet

249
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:49,264
that I sent
for Carlos' birthday?

250
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,874
'Cause I put a few extra

251
00:21:50,918 --> 00:21:53,616
white chocolate macadamias
in there, just for you.

252
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,618
What do you need?

253
00:21:55,662 --> 00:21:58,099
Me? Uh - Nothing. Nothing!

254
00:21:58,142 --> 00:22:00,319
But I have a "friend"
who could use a...

255
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:02,625
A preliminary hearing
rescheduled.

256
00:22:02,669 --> 00:22:05,541
Uh, Gonzalez v. New Mexico.

257
00:22:05,585 --> 00:22:09,371
My "friend" is looking for
a Friday around nine a.m...

258
00:22:09,415 --> 00:22:11,330
You know, before the judge's
fourth cup of coffee

259
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:13,941
because, uh, caffeine jitters...

260
00:22:13,984 --> 00:22:16,509
They're brutal
on the defense, so...

261
00:22:16,552 --> 00:22:19,381
What "friend"?

262
00:22:19,425 --> 00:22:22,123
I don't believe
you two have met.

263
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,005
What is this?

264
00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:37,486
A hearing change request form.

265
00:22:38,574 --> 00:22:41,055
Hey, come on. It's me...

266
00:22:41,098 --> 00:22:44,145
Look, Mommy. I just graduated.

267
00:22:44,188 --> 00:22:47,583
I... I can't use a pen.

268
00:22:47,627 --> 00:22:50,717
I have no opposable thumbs.

269
00:23:02,511 --> 00:23:04,121
Hey! Hannah Banana!

270
00:23:04,165 --> 00:23:06,515
Hey, yourself.

271
00:23:23,619 --> 00:23:26,405
Come on, Bill.
That's no way to treat a lady.

272
00:23:26,448 --> 00:23:28,015
You got to make love to it,
Bill.

273
00:23:28,058 --> 00:23:30,800
You know, be gentle...
That's the way to do it.

274
00:23:30,844 --> 00:23:34,761
Think Barry White,
think seduction.

275
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,855
Voilà.

276
00:23:45,554 --> 00:23:48,775
What the hell is going on?

277
00:23:48,818 --> 00:23:50,429
How come everyone's treating me

278
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:52,822
like I'm covered
in oozing pus sores?

279
00:23:52,866 --> 00:23:54,215
I liked you better

280
00:23:54,258 --> 00:23:56,173
when you were just
a regular bottom feeder.

281
00:23:56,217 --> 00:23:57,479
But this...

282
00:23:57,523 --> 00:23:59,829
"This"? What is "this"?

283
00:24:00,917 --> 00:24:03,354
I understand
advocating for your client.

284
00:24:03,398 --> 00:24:06,009
Deep in my heart, I get it.

285
00:24:06,053 --> 00:24:08,751
But you scammed the court,
you scammed the judge.

286
00:24:08,795 --> 00:24:10,405
And for what?

287
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,973
To get a murdering
cartel psychopath

288
00:24:13,016 --> 00:24:15,628
back out on the street?

289
00:24:15,671 --> 00:24:17,804
It's just...

290
00:24:17,847 --> 00:24:19,458
wrong.

291
00:24:22,069 --> 00:24:24,463
That's a lotta big talk, Bill.
Prove it.

292
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:26,247
Prove it, Bill!

293
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:31,208
There's proving,
and then there's knowing.

294
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:41,262
Abe, you don't want to go back
to county, do you?

295
00:24:41,305 --> 00:24:42,393
Nuh-uh.

296
00:24:42,437 --> 00:24:45,484
Okay. So the meetings?

297
00:24:45,527 --> 00:24:47,268
I'll go.

298
00:24:47,311 --> 00:24:49,096
Great.

299
00:24:49,139 --> 00:24:53,448
Then I'll see you Tuesday,

300
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,232
nine a.m. sharp.

301
00:25:02,109 --> 00:25:04,067
You want this?

302
00:25:04,111 --> 00:25:06,287
I do.

303
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:12,554
Take your time.

304
00:25:26,394 --> 00:25:28,091
Enjoy.

305
00:25:32,139 --> 00:25:35,055
Yeah, you can sit
anywhere you want. That's fine.

306
00:25:39,712 --> 00:25:42,323
Abe, would you mind
watching my stuff?

307
00:26:30,545 --> 00:26:32,286
Hey. Hello.

308
00:26:32,329 --> 00:26:34,767
Nice day.

309
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:36,595
Are you following me?

310
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:38,074
I'm sorry?

311
00:26:39,162 --> 00:26:43,166
Are you following me?

312
00:26:46,648 --> 00:26:48,607
What are you, APD?

313
00:26:52,915 --> 00:26:54,308
Know what?

314
00:26:54,351 --> 00:26:56,179
Ithink you're following me,

315
00:26:56,223 --> 00:26:58,007
and if you're not gonna
identify yourselves,

316
00:26:58,051 --> 00:27:00,488
then I'm calling in your plates
because I feel threatened.

317
00:27:03,491 --> 00:27:05,972
Sorry if we've disturbed you.

318
00:27:06,015 --> 00:27:08,844
You have a nice day, ma'am.

319
00:27:53,236 --> 00:27:55,456
Oh, yeah. Yeah, please.

320
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,117
Saul Goodman,
speedy justice for you.

321
00:28:05,901 --> 00:28:09,818
Uh, no, there's no charge
for the initial consultation.

322
00:28:09,862 --> 00:28:10,993
Today?

323
00:28:11,037 --> 00:28:13,039
Yeah, um...

324
00:28:13,082 --> 00:28:15,911
I have an opening around30.

325
00:28:15,955 --> 00:28:19,001
Oh, I'm working
out of my satellite office.

326
00:28:19,045 --> 00:28:20,524
It's at Juan Tabo and Skyline.

327
00:28:20,568 --> 00:28:22,526
I'm letting a nail salon
use the lobby,

328
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:25,878
so office is in back.

329
00:28:25,921 --> 00:28:28,881
Great. Uh, your name?

330
00:28:28,924 --> 00:28:30,665
Dante.

331
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,275
See you then.

332
00:28:37,063 --> 00:28:40,588
Saul Goodman,
speedy justice for you.

333
00:28:40,631 --> 00:28:43,504
Yeah. Uh, yeah.
I do have an opening today...

334
00:28:43,547 --> 00:28:46,681
Oh, hold on.
I'm getting another call.

335
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,074
Saul Goodman,
speedy justice for you.

336
00:28:48,117 --> 00:28:49,815
Um, hold, please.

337
00:28:49,858 --> 00:28:51,555
My apologies.

338
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:54,820
I'm having
a bit of a rush here today.

339
00:29:08,616 --> 00:29:11,140
You get these people out
right now.

340
00:29:11,184 --> 00:29:12,925
What? These guys?
Are they bothering you?

341
00:29:12,968 --> 00:29:15,754
Not them. Inside!

342
00:29:30,594 --> 00:29:32,553
Who's here to see Saul Goodman?

343
00:29:34,207 --> 00:29:36,557
You're him? You're Saul?

344
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,906
Yeah.

345
00:29:41,605 --> 00:29:43,564
Then you're the guy, right?

346
00:29:43,607 --> 00:29:45,914
What guy's that?

347
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:48,525
Salamanca's guy.

348
00:29:50,614 --> 00:29:52,834
Yeah.

349
00:29:52,878 --> 00:29:54,836
That's me.

350
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,404
Everybody who has
an appointment already...

351
00:29:57,447 --> 00:29:58,797
Uh, oh, you know...
You know what?

352
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,886
Um...

353
00:30:03,671 --> 00:30:04,977
Uh, Mr. "Spooge"?

354
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,761
It's just "Spooge."

355
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,372
Just Spooge.
Duly noted. Alright.

356
00:30:09,416 --> 00:30:11,287
Um, Gael Morengo?

357
00:30:11,331 --> 00:30:13,855
Okay. Uh, let's see.

358
00:30:13,899 --> 00:30:16,379
Is there a Dante? Mm-hmm.

359
00:30:16,423 --> 00:30:19,034
And Rocco Kubler. Okay.

360
00:30:19,078 --> 00:30:23,560
Everybody else, um,
kindly wait outside, alright?

361
00:30:23,604 --> 00:30:27,390
Unless... Unless you desire
spa services while you wait.

362
00:30:27,434 --> 00:30:30,785
Uh, that's a separate charge,
but it... it's highly recommended.

363
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,179
The... The best pedicures
in Albuquerque,

364
00:30:33,222 --> 00:30:34,920
right here.

365
00:30:34,963 --> 00:30:37,618
Six.

366
00:30:37,661 --> 00:30:39,750
Lucky number seven.

367
00:30:39,794 --> 00:30:41,056
Oh, you're with him?

368
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,928
And eight.

369
00:30:42,971 --> 00:30:44,364
Nice leathers.

370
00:30:44,407 --> 00:30:45,626
Uh, okay, together.

371
00:30:45,669 --> 00:30:47,280
And nine.

372
00:30:47,323 --> 00:30:48,716
Wow.

373
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:51,197
Um, thank you all
for your patience.

374
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,548
And... justice for all!

375
00:30:56,767 --> 00:30:58,944
Cucumber water
for paying customers only.

376
00:30:58,987 --> 00:31:02,469
Oh, believe me,
they're gonna be paying.

377
00:31:02,512 --> 00:31:03,818
"Spooge"!

378
00:31:05,515 --> 00:31:09,171
Oh, Spooge and friend.
Okay. Good. This way.

379
00:31:10,912 --> 00:31:13,567
Hi, ma'am.

380
00:31:16,962 --> 00:31:20,226
Yeah, hang... hang a left
at the washing machine.

381
00:31:20,269 --> 00:31:21,662
There you go.

382
00:31:21,705 --> 00:31:23,098
I'll see you next week, Rosa.

383
00:31:23,142 --> 00:31:25,144
And it was nice meeting you,
Pilar.

384
00:31:25,187 --> 00:31:27,407
Don't forget to bring as many
family members as you can.

385
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:28,712
We will. Thank you, Ms. Wexler.

386
00:31:28,756 --> 00:31:30,714
Take care.

387
00:31:42,465 --> 00:31:43,727
All done for today?

388
00:31:43,771 --> 00:31:45,425
Yeah. Here you go.

389
00:31:45,468 --> 00:31:47,253
Just keep it, Shelby.

390
00:31:47,296 --> 00:31:48,515
Thanks, Kim. See you tomorrow?

391
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:49,864
You bet.

392
00:31:52,475 --> 00:31:54,129
They're gone.

393
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:58,525
I'm sorry?

394
00:31:58,568 --> 00:32:02,224
The two men
that were following you.

395
00:32:02,268 --> 00:32:03,834
They're gone.

396
00:32:05,314 --> 00:32:07,926
Do I know you?

397
00:32:07,969 --> 00:32:09,971
Would you mind
sitting for a moment?

398
00:32:10,015 --> 00:32:13,061
And I will answer
any questions I can.

399
00:32:28,598 --> 00:32:31,558
I have men watching you
and your husband.

400
00:32:31,601 --> 00:32:34,604
I'm not with the police,
and as far as I know,

401
00:32:34,648 --> 00:32:37,172
they're not investigating
either of you.

402
00:32:37,216 --> 00:32:40,349
I doknow that you've been
up to a few things

403
00:32:40,393 --> 00:32:43,787
that you probably
would rather keep private.

404
00:32:43,831 --> 00:32:45,789
I don't care.

405
00:32:45,833 --> 00:32:48,836
That's not what this is about.

406
00:32:48,879 --> 00:32:52,579
I'm trying to solve
a problem of my own.

407
00:32:52,622 --> 00:32:54,755
What problem?

408
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,933
Lalo Salamanca.

409
00:33:01,762 --> 00:33:04,939
Lalo Salamanca's dead.

410
00:33:11,163 --> 00:33:14,340
He...

411
00:33:14,383 --> 00:33:16,342
isn't.

412
00:33:17,821 --> 00:33:20,172
We're watching anyone
he might contact.

413
00:33:20,215 --> 00:33:22,826
That includes you
and your husband.

414
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,611
Most likely,
he'll never reach out.

415
00:33:24,654 --> 00:33:27,657
He's got bigger fish to fry.

416
00:33:27,701 --> 00:33:31,139
But in the thousand-to-one
chance that he does...

417
00:33:34,229 --> 00:33:36,710
And who do you work for?

418
00:33:38,712 --> 00:33:41,367
I said I would answer
anything I can.

419
00:33:47,634 --> 00:33:49,592
You're the guy from the desert.

420
00:33:50,985 --> 00:33:53,161
The one who was out there
with Jimmy.

421
00:33:56,469 --> 00:33:59,950
Why are you telling methis
and not him?

422
00:34:01,387 --> 00:34:05,130
Because I think you're made
of sterner stuff.

423
00:34:09,264 --> 00:34:11,919
Alright.

424
00:34:11,962 --> 00:34:14,878
Now here's what's best
for everyone.

425
00:34:14,922 --> 00:34:18,839
You spot my guys again,
which I'm hoping you won't,

426
00:34:18,882 --> 00:34:21,363
let them go about
their business.

427
00:34:21,407 --> 00:34:23,452
Just pretend they're not there.

428
00:34:23,496 --> 00:34:27,500
And pretty soon they won't be.

429
00:34:27,543 --> 00:34:29,458
You and your husband

430
00:34:29,502 --> 00:34:31,808
just...

431
00:34:31,852 --> 00:34:34,420
go on living your lives.

432
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,598
I doknow you.

433
00:34:40,687 --> 00:34:43,385
You worked in the parking booth
at the courthouse.

434
00:34:44,908 --> 00:34:47,433
You're the attendant.

435
00:34:50,262 --> 00:34:52,394
I was.

436
00:35:44,316 --> 00:35:45,969
Hi...

437
00:36:10,603 --> 00:36:12,518
The markets will continue
to be in a state of flux

438
00:36:12,561 --> 00:36:14,389
until the Fed
tightens interest rates.

439
00:36:14,433 --> 00:36:16,130
Some days we'll feel
pretty good about the rate

440
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,045
of economic recovery,
other days not so much.

441
00:36:18,088 --> 00:36:20,003
Because of these macro issues.

442
00:36:20,047 --> 00:36:24,094
The deficit, interest rates,
oil prices, what have you...

443
00:38:37,967 --> 00:38:41,493
Mrs. I think I saw
that somewhere. Here!

444
00:38:41,536 --> 00:38:44,278
Mrs. Nope.

445
00:38:47,368 --> 00:38:50,153
How's youredge coming along?

446
00:38:50,197 --> 00:38:54,070
I'm still missing two...

447
00:38:54,114 --> 00:38:56,116
Mr. You found
all your edge pieces.

448
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:58,336
I thought I did.

449
00:38:58,379 --> 00:39:01,034
Maybe we lost a few.

450
00:39:01,077 --> 00:39:04,211
These trees are killing me.

451
00:39:04,254 --> 00:39:07,127
The pieces all look
exactly the same.

452
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:09,695
Then work on the cabin. I could.

453
00:39:38,027 --> 00:39:40,203
There was a green Ford van.

454
00:39:40,247 --> 00:39:43,032
It was behind me
for almost three blocks.

455
00:39:43,076 --> 00:39:45,861
A '98 Econoline.
We ran the plate.

456
00:39:45,905 --> 00:39:47,907
Guy's a freelance plumber.

457
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:49,735
He's legit.

458
00:39:51,214 --> 00:39:53,652
The man you placed
in my kitchen.

459
00:39:53,695 --> 00:39:54,914
Roy.

460
00:39:54,957 --> 00:39:56,350
You told me

461
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,832
that he had experience
as a short-order cook.

462
00:39:59,875 --> 00:40:02,530
Two years at McDonald's
in college.

463
00:40:02,574 --> 00:40:04,532
He's not there
just to make French fries.

464
00:40:04,576 --> 00:40:06,491
I need guys in close.

465
00:40:08,623 --> 00:40:10,973
He's not up to Pollos standards.

466
00:40:12,627 --> 00:40:15,500
I'll find a replacement.

467
00:40:15,543 --> 00:40:17,632
We're stretched thin.

468
00:40:17,676 --> 00:40:21,593
I've got guys working
18-hour days all over town.

469
00:40:21,636 --> 00:40:24,422
Two weeks.
We haven't had a tickle.

470
00:40:24,465 --> 00:40:26,206
And?

471
00:40:26,249 --> 00:40:27,555
All due respect,

472
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:30,776
the rest of the world thinks
the guy is dead.

473
00:40:32,778 --> 00:40:36,782
Lalo Salamanca is alive.

474
00:40:40,916 --> 00:40:42,440
Then where is he?

475
00:41:02,111 --> 00:41:04,244
Hey.

476
00:41:04,287 --> 00:41:06,028
Hey.

477
00:41:06,072 --> 00:41:07,203
How was your day?

478
00:41:07,247 --> 00:41:09,205
Uh, what are we doing here?

479
00:41:09,249 --> 00:41:11,381
Take a look. What do you think?

480
00:41:12,687 --> 00:41:15,081
About what?

481
00:41:15,124 --> 00:41:17,692
My new office. Potentially.

482
00:41:17,736 --> 00:41:20,434
Come on.

483
00:41:31,706 --> 00:41:33,621
Huh.

484
00:41:33,665 --> 00:41:36,406
Mrs. Nguyen kicked me
to the curb.

485
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:38,408
What? Why?

486
00:41:38,452 --> 00:41:40,889
It's a long story, but upshot is

487
00:41:40,933 --> 00:41:44,806
she wants me outta there
with extreme prejudice.

488
00:41:45,807 --> 00:41:47,983
Wow.

489
00:41:48,027 --> 00:41:49,332
Bad day, huh?

490
00:41:50,943 --> 00:41:53,728
No. It was a great day.

491
00:41:53,772 --> 00:41:56,644
With actual paying clients.

492
00:41:56,688 --> 00:41:57,906
The word is out!

493
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:59,908
People are throwing
cash retainers at me...

494
00:41:59,952 --> 00:42:02,868
Just to say
Saul Goodman is their lawyer.

495
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,524
Because of who you represented.

496
00:42:08,351 --> 00:42:10,702
Well, I mean, that's part of it.

497
00:42:10,745 --> 00:42:12,704
But, um, the bottom line is

498
00:42:12,747 --> 00:42:16,316
I need a new place
to do business... pronto.

499
00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:17,883
Now, this place is a shithole,

500
00:42:17,926 --> 00:42:19,754
but the price is right

501
00:42:19,798 --> 00:42:22,583
and I think I can talk the
landlord into a month-to-month.

502
00:42:22,627 --> 00:42:26,718
So it's temporary, you know,
'til I find something better.

503
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,767
Hey.

504
00:42:32,811 --> 00:42:34,464
What do you think?

505
00:42:40,732 --> 00:42:43,691
It's small.

506
00:42:43,735 --> 00:42:46,215
It's... dirty.

507
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:50,002
And this whole place
smells funny.

508
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,704
But the courthouse
is five blocks away.

509
00:42:56,748 --> 00:43:00,316
You can't get to MDC
without driving past.

510
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,841
Parking is good,
bail bond row isn't far,

511
00:43:02,884 --> 00:43:06,148
and, uh...

512
00:43:06,192 --> 00:43:08,586
Taco Cabeza is just around
the corner.

513
00:43:10,196 --> 00:43:12,372
Might be a diamond in the rough.

514
00:43:16,028 --> 00:43:18,378
Just promise me...

515
00:43:19,814 --> 00:43:21,903
...you won't move the toilet.

516
00:43:25,733 --> 00:43:28,388
There it is. Alright.

517
00:43:28,431 --> 00:43:31,609
Um, speaking of
the Taco Cabeza...

518
00:43:31,652 --> 00:43:34,568
I'm starving. Let's do it.

519
00:43:55,067 --> 00:43:56,851
On the next episode
of "Better Call Saul..."

520
00:43:56,895 --> 00:43:58,418
Thank God he's dead.

521
00:43:58,461 --> 00:44:00,246
I can put more guys on the place

522
00:44:00,289 --> 00:44:01,856
if that's what you're thinking.

523
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,466
Open for business.

524
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:06,034
What you're doing to help the
little guy, it's incredible.

525
00:44:06,078 --> 00:44:07,470
I'm just getting started.

526
00:44:07,514 --> 00:44:10,038
I just need you
to know that I know.

527
00:44:10,082 --> 00:44:11,213
It wasn't me, Cliff.

528
00:44:11,257 --> 00:44:13,433
Sounds like money. Okay. Great.

529
00:44:16,784 --> 00:44:19,178
Who is this Saul Goodman? You?

530
00:44:19,221 --> 00:44:20,440
You got it.
