00:09:56,487 --> 00:09:59,925
He got lunch for himself
and his receptionist

179
00:10:00,056 --> 00:10:01,144
at around 1:30.

180
00:10:01,275 --> 00:10:03,059
The Vietnamese place again.

181
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,017
Then, in the... What's this?

182
00:10:05,148 --> 00:10:07,019
Yeah, I was just
getting to that.

183
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:10,240
That was three days ago.
Only time he broke the pattern.

184
00:10:10,371 --> 00:10:12,199
Stopped at Cradock Marine
over on Central

185
00:10:12,329 --> 00:10:14,505
instead of going
straight to the office.

186
00:10:14,636 --> 00:10:17,378
Looked like he made
a cash withdrawal.

187
00:10:17,508 --> 00:10:18,988
I couldn't get a good angle
through the window,

188
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:22,383
but I counted four,
maybe five stacks?

189
00:10:22,513 --> 00:10:25,386
I'd say somewhere
in the ballpark of 20 grand.

190
00:10:27,388 --> 00:10:30,739
I'm not a lawyer,
but is there any reason

191
00:10:30,869 --> 00:10:33,785
he'd need that much cash in
the normal course of business?

192
00:10:36,658 --> 00:10:39,487
No legitimate reason.

193
00:10:44,753 --> 00:10:47,277
[Knock on door]

194
00:10:54,893 --> 00:10:57,157
[Lock disengages]

195
00:10:59,985 --> 00:11:02,423
Mr. Oliver: Thank you so much, Doc.
Of course. Of course. Come on in.

196
00:11:02,553 --> 00:11:03,902
We'll take a look.

197
00:11:04,033 --> 00:11:05,948
It's gonna be okay.

198
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:08,124
Gonna be okay.

199
00:11:08,255 --> 00:11:10,039
[Keys jingling, lock engages]

200
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,781
Come on.

201
00:11:12,911 --> 00:11:15,436
[Dog whining]
Caldera: Okay.
Fernando's gonna be fine.

202
00:11:15,566 --> 00:11:17,655
The shot I gave him
will settle his stomach.

203
00:11:17,786 --> 00:11:19,701
But I want to keep him
for a few more minutes,

204
00:11:19,831 --> 00:11:21,659
make sure he doesn't have
any reactions.

205
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:24,009
After that, you're all set.
That's such a relief.

206
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,708
We were so worried.We're lucky
you were able to see us.

207
00:11:26,838 --> 00:11:28,057
Ah, it's no problem.

208
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,232
I was already here
with another patient.

209
00:11:29,363 --> 00:11:32,844
Alright.
Be back. [Smooches]

210
00:11:32,975 --> 00:11:34,803
[Door creaks lightly]

211
00:11:34,933 --> 00:11:37,414
[Dogs barking]

212
00:11:50,384 --> 00:11:52,734
Alright.
How are we doing?

213
00:11:52,864 --> 00:11:55,563
I dunno, um, I guess
my skin's a little dry

214
00:11:55,693 --> 00:11:59,480
where you put that stuff on,
but otherwise...

215
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,095
Are you sure
you used enough?

216
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,401
Absolutely.
[Sighs]

217
00:12:07,531 --> 00:12:09,446
Just give it
a little more time.

218
00:12:09,577 --> 00:12:11,492
Look all the way
to the right.

219
00:12:11,622 --> 00:12:14,408
Now to the left.

220
00:12:14,538 --> 00:12:16,323
What's it gonna
feel like?

221
00:12:16,453 --> 00:12:19,935
[Sighs] Depends on how
used to caffeine you are.

222
00:12:20,065 --> 00:12:23,678
I mean, you're not gonna be
trippin' balls, but...

223
00:12:23,808 --> 00:12:25,332
it's gonna feel like,
you know,

224
00:12:25,462 --> 00:12:28,073
two Red Bulls
on an empty stomach.

225
00:12:28,204 --> 00:12:30,206
And how long
is it gonna last?

226
00:12:30,337 --> 00:12:32,077
Is the guy
roughly your size?

227
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:34,254
Yeah.

228
00:12:34,384 --> 00:12:36,430
An hour or two.

229
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,302
And if there's
a blood test?

230
00:12:39,433 --> 00:12:41,435
This stuff is not showing up
on any blood panel

231
00:12:41,565 --> 00:12:43,175
they're running
in this town.

232
00:12:43,306 --> 00:12:45,482
You're gonna do this,
this is the way to go.

233
00:12:47,397 --> 00:12:49,181
Here.
[Chuckling] Whoa, whoa.

234
00:12:49,312 --> 00:12:51,096
Promise me
this has been sterilized.

235
00:12:51,227 --> 00:12:53,403
It's brand new,

236
00:12:53,534 --> 00:12:56,580
and for you,
it goes under the armpit.

237
00:12:56,711 --> 00:12:57,755
[Chuckling] Okay.

238
00:12:57,886 --> 00:12:59,366
Sorry.

239
00:13:00,671 --> 00:13:05,546
[Sighs] I cannot wait to be done
with all of this.

240
00:13:05,676 --> 00:13:07,809
I hear ya.
You know, I read somewhere

241
00:13:07,939 --> 00:13:10,681
that vets are even more
depressed than lawyers.

242
00:13:10,812 --> 00:13:12,466
[Chuckles]
Depressed?

243
00:13:12,596 --> 00:13:14,163
No, no, no, no, no.

244
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,905
I love being a vet.

245
00:13:17,035 --> 00:13:18,820
Look over there.

246
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,735
See that?

247
00:13:20,865 --> 00:13:23,390
That's what
it's all about.

248
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,000
Animals are my life.

249
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:28,177
It's this other stuff
that's getting to be too much,

250
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,657
no offense.

251
00:13:32,007 --> 00:13:35,010
Anyway, a guy's gotta know
when he's bagged his limit.

252
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,578
What...
so you're closing up shop?

253
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,623
Yep. Leaving town.

254
00:13:39,754 --> 00:13:41,495
Once I sell
my little black book,

255
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:43,845
it's gonna be all animals,
all the time.

256
00:13:43,975 --> 00:13:45,586
Black book?

257
00:13:45,716 --> 00:13:47,588
Yeah, the keys
to the kingdom.

258
00:13:47,718 --> 00:13:50,808
You know, you call me up,
you're looking for a someone?

259
00:13:50,939 --> 00:13:53,724
[Taps book]
Keep all my "someones" in here.

260
00:13:53,855 --> 00:13:56,205
Can I see it?

261
00:14:01,297 --> 00:14:03,604
Knock yourself out.

262
00:14:03,734 --> 00:14:07,042
[Chuckles] Oh.

263
00:14:07,172 --> 00:14:09,087
Alright, yeah.
I think we, uh...

264
00:14:09,218 --> 00:14:11,394
we found
the Zodiac Killer.

265
00:14:11,525 --> 00:14:17,313
Well...I'm not keeping my
contacts in plain English.

266
00:14:17,444 --> 00:14:20,055
"Best Quality Vacuum"?

267
00:14:20,185 --> 00:14:24,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

268
00:14:24,451 --> 00:14:26,844
Alright.
Let's give it another 10.

269
00:14:26,975 --> 00:14:28,803
I'll be back.

270
00:14:28,933 --> 00:14:31,588
[Sighs]

271
00:14:31,719 --> 00:14:33,764
What a waste.

272
00:14:33,895 --> 00:14:35,897
You think?

273
00:14:36,027 --> 00:14:38,639
[Scoffs] Did you see how many
people he had in that book?

274
00:14:38,769 --> 00:14:42,207
I mean, he's raking it in,
day in, day out.

275
00:14:42,338 --> 00:14:45,080
It's passive income.
Minimal risk.

276
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:47,822
I can't believe
he's walking away from that.

277
00:14:47,952 --> 00:14:50,868
Well...

278
00:14:50,999 --> 00:14:55,003
he knows
what he wants.

279
00:14:55,133 --> 00:14:56,874
Anything?

280
00:14:57,005 --> 00:15:01,226
[Sighs] Not really.

281
00:15:01,357 --> 00:15:03,098
[Chuckling]
Oh, my God.

282
00:15:03,228 --> 00:15:04,708
What?
Uh...

283
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:06,449
[Chuckles]

284
00:15:11,454 --> 00:15:13,891
Whoa.
[Breathes sharply]

285
00:15:18,722 --> 00:15:21,812
Judge Metcalf: Hold on. Hold on.
Let's just cut to the chase.

286
00:15:21,943 --> 00:15:24,902
Your client... who has, let's
call it a "checkered" past,

287
00:15:25,033 --> 00:15:27,775
was pulled over for a clear
violation of traffic laws

288
00:15:27,905 --> 00:15:31,735
and found in possession of
a felony quantity of marijuana.

289
00:15:31,866 --> 00:15:34,477
And now you're asking me
to throw out this evidence?

290
00:15:34,608 --> 00:15:36,523
In words of one syllable,

291
00:15:36,653 --> 00:15:39,830
how does this pass
the smell test?

292
00:15:39,961 --> 00:15:42,833
Kim:
Your Honor [clears throat]

293
00:15:42,964 --> 00:15:46,054
this is what
this is all about.

294
00:15:46,184 --> 00:15:48,056
According to
Officer Connell's report,

295
00:15:48,186 --> 00:15:50,754
this is the reason
Joshua Holcome was pulled over.

296
00:15:50,885 --> 00:15:54,192
New Mexico statue 66-3-846.

297
00:15:54,323 --> 00:15:56,717
Driving with
an obstructed window.

298
00:15:56,847 --> 00:15:59,284
This morning,
I did an informal survey

299
00:15:59,415 --> 00:16:00,808
of the courthouse parking lot.

300
00:16:00,938 --> 00:16:03,375
And by my count,
over a third of the vehicles

301
00:16:03,506 --> 00:16:06,988
had something similar hanging
from their rear-view mirrors.

302
00:16:07,118 --> 00:16:10,731
I believe your car
was one of them, Your Honor.

303
00:16:10,861 --> 00:16:15,387
So [sighs] unless you
and 47 of our colleagues

304
00:16:15,518 --> 00:16:17,912
have outstanding tickets,
I'd argue that this statute

305
00:16:18,042 --> 00:16:20,610
is not...
regularly enforced.

306
00:16:20,741 --> 00:16:23,395
Your Honor, this was
a perfectly reasonable,

307
00:16:23,526 --> 00:16:25,223
routine stop for cause.

308
00:16:25,354 --> 00:16:26,703
Uh, what's the point here?

309
00:16:26,834 --> 00:16:29,401
The point is
that this was not routine.

310
00:16:29,532 --> 00:16:30,881
Officer Connell
knew my client.

311
00:16:31,012 --> 00:16:32,970
In fact,
he arrested him five years ago

312
00:16:33,101 --> 00:16:34,668
when Joshua was a juvenile.

313
00:16:34,798 --> 00:16:36,191
And Officer Connell's
record shows

314
00:16:36,321 --> 00:16:37,975
that this is only
the third citation

315
00:16:38,106 --> 00:16:40,935
he's written for this statute
in almost 20 years.

316
00:16:41,065 --> 00:16:44,373
So either this is
an incredible coincidence

317
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:47,158
or Officer Connell
recognized my client

318
00:16:47,289 --> 00:16:48,812
and used the dangler
as a pretext

319
00:16:48,943 --> 00:16:51,249
to violate
his Fourth Amendment rights.

320
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,774
Your Honor, all I'm asking
is that you take another look

321
00:16:53,904 --> 00:16:55,210
at the officer's statement.

322
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,734
Ask yourself
if the state's version of events

323
00:16:57,865 --> 00:16:59,910
passes the "smell test."

324
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:02,609
[Whirring]

325
00:17:04,045 --> 00:17:06,438
[Clanking]

326
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:07,701
Main:
That was nicely argued.

327
00:17:07,831 --> 00:17:09,572
Thanks. We'll see
what the judge does.

328
00:17:09,703 --> 00:17:11,618
[Chuckles]
[Clears throat]

329
00:17:11,748 --> 00:17:14,011
Defense like that takes time
to pull together, doesn't it?

330
00:17:14,142 --> 00:17:15,796
Whaddya think it took...
30 hours?

331
00:17:15,926 --> 00:17:18,712
Oh, probably
more like 50.

332
00:17:18,842 --> 00:17:21,192
50 hours. Huh.

333
00:17:21,323 --> 00:17:23,194
And the contracts office...
they pay...?

334
00:17:23,325 --> 00:17:25,414
$700 a case. Flat.

335
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:28,243
So you're making minimum wage,
more or less.

336
00:17:31,507 --> 00:17:33,727
Whew.

337
00:17:33,857 --> 00:17:36,251
I've been meaning to ask,
if you don't mind...

338
00:17:36,381 --> 00:17:38,819
how did you leave things
with Howard Hamlin?

339
00:17:38,949 --> 00:17:41,691
[Indistinct conversations in distance]

340
00:17:41,822 --> 00:17:44,738
I wouldn't be here today
if it wasn't for Howard.

341
00:17:46,087 --> 00:17:49,351
I wouldn't be an attorney.
I wouldn't have met my husband.

342
00:17:51,005 --> 00:17:55,705
I owe Howard and HHM a lot.

343
00:18:03,104 --> 00:18:06,063
Have you heard of
the Jackson Mercer Foundation?

344
00:18:07,325 --> 00:18:08,675
Of course.

345
00:18:08,805 --> 00:18:10,851
They fund justice reform
programs on the East Coast.

346
00:18:10,981 --> 00:18:12,853
I wish we had something
like that out here.

347
00:18:12,983 --> 00:18:17,727
Well, it's a bit hush-hush
at the moment, but we will soon.

348
00:18:17,858 --> 00:18:20,295
And that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

349
00:18:21,992 --> 00:18:24,429
[Footsteps approaching]

350
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,302
