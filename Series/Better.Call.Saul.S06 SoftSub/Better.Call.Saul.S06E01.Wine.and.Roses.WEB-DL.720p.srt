00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,230

of chaos.

168
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,980

<i>We know this much.</i>

173
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,770
Ignacio Varga is a rat.

174
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,030
Don Eladio has put a price
on his head.

175
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,380
Every man we have
is searching for him.

176
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:19,210
When Varga's found, we'll know
who he was working for.

177
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:24,000
I assume Don Hector
has been told.

178
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,440
<i>I called him myself.</i>

179
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,180
<i>As for if he understood me,</i>

180
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,270
Listen to me.

00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:06,960
I checked your client's

237
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,180
The address he gave?

238
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,180
It's a Dairy Queen
in Alta Monte.

239
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:13,400
The family that showed at the
bail hearing can't be located.

240
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:15,540
No driver's license,
no tax rolls,

241

no school records. Nothing.

242
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,890

a single Elizabeth McKinnon

Well, this is --
this is surprising.

245
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,770
Your client
has disappeared,

246
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:30,380
and I'm not waiting six weeks
to start looking for him.

247
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:33,420
Hey, my guy put up
seven million in bail.

248
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,210
You think he's just
gonna walk away from that?

249
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,470
Who comes up with
seven million bucks in cash?

250
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,990
You know what I think?

251
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,170
I think
the family was fake,

252
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:43,090

the whole time.

didn't go your way,

255
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,830
and now you're trying
for a do-over.

256
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:50,480
You say my guy ran?

257
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,750
I say he's got seven million
reasons for showing up --

258
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:55,140
when he's legally required
to do so.

259
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,620
So, no,

any of this crap around

263
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:06,460
