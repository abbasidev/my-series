Yeah, but why three minutes?

391
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,690
Because at three minutes,

392
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,960
that's when security
sees you on the cameras

393
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:35,460
and the cops haul
your ass to jail, all right?

394
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,460
So let's go. Wait,
there's cameras?

395
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,670
Sure, there's cameras!

They erase the

397
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:42,870
So that's why you only

398
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,040
take three of each.

399
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:45,570
And only the pricey stuff.

400
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,710

the next morning,

401
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,320
they won't even know
they were robbed.

402
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:52,280
By the time they do
inventory, abracadabra!

403
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:54,720
No more Jeffie
on the tape, right?

404
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:58,290

00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,520
