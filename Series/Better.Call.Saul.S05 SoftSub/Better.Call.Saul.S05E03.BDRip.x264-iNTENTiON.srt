1
00:03:33,506 --> 00:03:34,506
Okay.

2
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:29,187
Can I talk?

3
00:04:30,647 --> 00:04:32,941
I... I'll talk.

4
00:04:34,651 --> 00:04:36,903
I have a feeling I know
what this is about.

5
00:04:37,946 --> 00:04:40,073
Just to get the ball rolling,

6
00:04:40,156 --> 00:04:45,036
please keep in mind that whatever happened
between Mr. Varga and myself,

7
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:47,163
I'm hoping it's just
water under the bridge.

8
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:49,415
Because after all was said and done,

9
00:04:49,499 --> 00:04:51,334
you did walk out a free man.

10
00:04:51,417 --> 00:04:54,170
I mean, you weren't even in custody
for a full day.

11
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:58,341
And I admit it was a tad bumpy
getting there,

12
00:04:58,424 --> 00:05:00,843
but the path to justice is rarely smooth.

13
00:05:00,927 --> 00:05:05,431
So I'm hoping that, in the end, you know,
the final result speaks for itself.

14
00:05:10,353 --> 00:05:12,230
You had business with my cousin, Tuco.

15
00:05:13,982 --> 00:05:15,483
Tuco?

16
00:05:19,404 --> 00:05:20,863
Oh, sure, sure, yeah.

17
00:05:20,947 --> 00:05:23,408
And I see the family resemblance.

18
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:25,743
Your cousin makes quite an impression.

19
00:05:25,827 --> 00:05:32,542
You know, he has a huge heart, and a...
A serious passion for justice.

20
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,961
He's got a temper, huh?

21
00:05:35,044 --> 00:05:36,129
I hadn't noticed.

22
00:05:36,212 --> 00:05:39,090
How is your lovely abuelita?

23
00:05:45,013 --> 00:05:46,973
You know, Tuco told me about you.

24
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:50,476
You're the guy with the mouth.

25
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:52,769
Yeah.

26
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:57,025
Those guys at the house...

27
00:05:58,109 --> 00:05:59,819
what'd they call her?

28
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:00,903
Biznatch.

29
00:06:03,072 --> 00:06:05,116
Biznatch, yeah.

30
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,199
Right.

31
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:10,872
You know, the Tuco I know,

32
00:06:10,955 --> 00:06:14,333
he would've skinned them alive
and let the buzzards eat their eyeballs.

33
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:16,753
But there you were.

34
00:06:16,836 --> 00:06:19,464
You go, blah, blah, blah,
and they walk out of there.

35
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:21,257
I mean, it's amazing, really.

36
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,134
They wheeled out, actually.

37
00:06:26,471 --> 00:06:28,473
So Ignacio and I...

38
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:32,185
we got something you can do for us.

39
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:34,604
Really?

40
00:06:34,687 --> 00:06:36,773
Yeah, we got a legal problem.

41
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:40,860
A le... A legal problem?

42
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:43,821
All right, fantastic. I'm so...

43
00:06:43,905 --> 00:06:46,407
It's just that, for a minute there,
I thought I was gonna be

44
00:06:46,491 --> 00:06:48,993
swallowing condoms filled with heroin.

45
00:06:51,162 --> 00:06:52,120
No.

46
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:53,164
Maybe later.

47
00:06:54,874 --> 00:06:57,126
We have a guy sitting in MDC.

48
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,586
Picked up two days ago.

49
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:01,297
- Picked up for what?
- Yeah, we'll get to that.

50
00:07:02,298 --> 00:07:05,802
We need our friend
to tell the cops some things.

51
00:07:05,885 --> 00:07:07,720
Some important things.

52
00:07:07,804 --> 00:07:09,388
Important things. Gotcha.

53
00:07:09,472 --> 00:07:12,433
We want him to say
exactly what we tell him.

54
00:07:12,517 --> 00:07:14,143
No more, no less.

55
00:07:14,227 --> 00:07:16,437
But the cops can't know
it's coming from us.

56
00:07:16,521 --> 00:07:19,107
So we send you in there,

57
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:21,943
you tell him how to do it,

58
00:07:22,026 --> 00:07:24,028
and they can't listen.

59
00:07:24,112 --> 00:07:26,739
Attorney-client confidentiality.

60
00:07:26,823 --> 00:07:28,407
Yeah, that.

61
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,539
That's flattering.

62
00:07:38,835 --> 00:07:42,130
Can I offer this?

63
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:45,842
Listen, I guarantee there are five
of these in MDC right now.

64
00:07:45,925 --> 00:07:49,220
You know, drop phones
inside someone's prison wallet,

65
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:50,805
if you know what I'm talking about.

66
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:54,851
Anyway, you talk directly to your guy,
cut out the middleman.

67
00:07:54,934 --> 00:07:57,562
It works better if you're
in there with him.

68
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:01,524
You're the guy for this.

69
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:05,695
That's just... That's...

70
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:08,823
Terrific.
That's the only word for it.

71
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:17,373
In good conscience, I think I have
to warn you that my rates have gone up,

72
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:19,750
so going this way could be expensive.

73
00:08:21,878 --> 00:08:24,505
Like how expensive?

74
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:27,675
Expensive. It's...

75
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:29,969
- I mean...
- Yeah?

76
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:31,387
Yeah...

77
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,890
Oh, gee, well, it's a full day of my time

78
00:08:33,973 --> 00:08:39,478
and prep work, transportation, rush fees.

79
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:40,478
Do the math,

80
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:46,861
it's like, 7000, 8... 900,

81
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:49,614
25 dollars.

82
00:08:49,697 --> 00:08:51,908
Yeah.

83
00:08:51,991 --> 00:08:52,991
Yeah.

84
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:58,831
Seven thousand, nine hundred
and twenty-five?

85
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,710
It's the going rate, so...

86
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:08,673
Sure.

87
00:09:21,896 --> 00:09:24,690
For your trouble, let's make it 8.

88
00:09:29,862 --> 00:09:33,074
Well, okay, then.

89
00:09:38,246 --> 00:09:42,083
<i>Change the colours and do well</i>

90
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,876
Another.

91
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:48,214
<i>You can paint the sky,
the sky is mine</i>

92
00:09:50,508 --> 00:09:53,427
I don't know, Mike.
How about you call it a night?

93
00:09:53,511 --> 00:09:55,263
And I'll get you a cab.

94
00:10:05,273 --> 00:10:07,566
Put them in the register
and pour me another.

95
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:21,956
<i>You can turn the world upside down</i>

96
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,086
<i>Change the colours and do well</i>

97
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:33,342
<i>You can paint the sky,
the sky is mine</i>

98
00:10:33,426 --> 00:10:37,888
<i>I don't care, I don't care</i>

99
00:10:37,972 --> 00:10:39,807
- Hey.
- Yeah?

100
00:10:41,726 --> 00:10:43,144
You see that?

101
00:10:44,979 --> 00:10:46,897
You wanna do something for me?

102
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,359
Take it down.

103
00:10:51,944 --> 00:10:53,029
What?

104
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:58,200
Right there.
The third from the bottom.

105
00:10:59,994 --> 00:11:01,704
I don't know, Mike.

106
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:03,205
Customers send these in.

107
00:11:03,289 --> 00:11:04,999
It's a tradition.

108
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:06,208
Take it down.

109
00:11:08,586 --> 00:11:09,879
Sorry, Mike.

110
00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:12,298
Take it down.

111
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:15,092
I think you've had enough.

112
00:11:15,176 --> 00:11:17,303
Take it down now.

113
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:24,392
Please?

114
00:11:25,478 --> 00:11:29,482
<i>You can turn the world upside down</i>

115
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:34,445
<i>Change the colours and do well</i>

116
00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:40,743
<i>You can paint the sky,
the sky is mine</i>

117
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:57,134
Oh, my God. You know
that's my sister, y'all.

118
00:11:58,761 --> 00:12:01,597
Hey, she is spicy, yo.
That's all I'm saying.

119
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,140
I'm trying to holla at her.

120
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:06,143
Check this fool out.

121
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:10,898
All right, y'all, let's play.

122
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:14,735
Hey, gramps, where you going?

123
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:16,904
Yo, got 20 bucks you could lend me?

124
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:22,118
Don't be scared.

125
00:12:22,201 --> 00:12:23,369
I ain't gonna bite.

126
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:29,667
I got a lot more than 20 bucks, asshole.

127
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:33,129
Hey, yo, gramps can throw down, okay.

128
00:12:33,212 --> 00:12:35,214
You'll let old cue ball talk to you
like that?

129
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:36,632
Hold up, gramps.

130
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:49,185
So?

131
00:13:28,893 --> 00:13:29,893
Hey.

132
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:32,687
Hey.

133
00:13:45,201 --> 00:13:46,619
You done?

134
00:13:46,702 --> 00:13:47,953
Just about.

135
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:52,500
Thanks.

136
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,388
Everything good?

137
00:14:06,472 --> 00:14:07,515
Yeah.

138
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:11,810
I'm sort of celebrating, actually.

139
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:13,354
Celebrating what?

140
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:18,359
I just realised I have
all pro bono clients tomorrow, all day.

141
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:19,777
No Mesa Verde.

142
00:14:21,946 --> 00:14:23,113
Well, all right.

143
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:25,824
- To justice.
- Yeah.

144
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,124
What about you?

145
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:36,459
Well...

146
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:39,755
I met...

147
00:14:41,757 --> 00:14:44,343
some interesting people.

148
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:46,971
And had a few...

149
00:14:48,556 --> 00:14:49,974
ups and downs.

150
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:53,435
But you know what?

151
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:58,274
Financially speaking,
Saul Goodman just had his best day yet.

152
00:14:58,357 --> 00:14:59,984
Ka-ching.

153
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:11,579
Good for Saul.

154
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:20,462
I'd better prep for tomorrow.

155
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:23,966
Right. Go get them, tiger.

156
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:53,621
Numilifor is not for everyone.
Call your doctor if you have...

157
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:54,788
Sorry.

158
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:01,879
What are you doing?

159
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:04,423
I have to take it apart to clean it.

160
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:20,689
Hey.

161
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,734
Hey. Leave this alone.

162
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,319
Leave it alone.

163
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:30,616
Check this out.

164
00:16:45,673 --> 00:16:47,341
Did you order food?

165
00:16:57,393 --> 00:16:58,727
Yeah?

166
00:16:58,811 --> 00:17:00,229
Ignacio?

167
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:01,522
What?

168
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:04,191
I want to see Ignacio.

169
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:05,734
Who is this?

170
00:17:05,818 --> 00:17:07,236
His father.

171
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:14,284
Is everything okay?

172
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:15,786
Yes. Of course.

173
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:16,870
Can I come in?

174
00:17:19,832 --> 00:17:21,333
It's okay?

175
00:17:22,418 --> 00:17:23,669
It's fine.

176
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:37,599
Hi.

177
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,395
Amber, this is my father.

178
00:17:45,941 --> 00:17:47,151
Nice to meet you.

179
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:48,610
Oh, yeah, me too.

180
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:52,531
Excuse me.

181
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,601
Can I get you anything?

182
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:24,146
Want a coffee?

183
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:25,229
No.

184
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:31,653
So big.

185
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:35,199
And new.

186
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:02,476
How are you, Papa?

187
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:08,899
Gutierrez made me an offer.
He wants to buy the shop.

188
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:11,776
Really?

189
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:15,656
Don't tell me.

190
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:17,658
Does he want to turn it into
another tyre shop?

191
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,660
No.

192
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:23,121
He wants to keep it as is.

193
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:26,916
But...

194
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,087
he offered more than it's worth

195
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,464
even with the land.

196
00:19:37,052 --> 00:19:38,387
What are you going to do?

197
00:19:44,852 --> 00:19:48,105
I always thought I was keeping
the shop for you.

198
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:58,740
Are you going to work 11 hours a day

199
00:19:58,824 --> 00:20:00,033
for the rest of your life?

200
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:05,873
What do you think?

201
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:09,167
It sounds like a good deal.

202
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:12,963
Could be...

203
00:20:14,423 --> 00:20:15,924
your chance to retire.

204
00:20:23,432 --> 00:20:25,183
This is you, isn't it?

205
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:29,897
I don't know what you mean.

206
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,857
You put Gutierrez up to this.

207
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:35,277
This is your money he's offering me.

208
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:39,323
Papa, no.

209
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:40,324
No.

210
00:20:40,325 --> 00:20:42,367
This is you trying to get me
to leave town.

211
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:44,369
You want to run.

212
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:46,455
You want me to run too.

213
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:49,291
Deny it.

214
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:51,710
Tell me I'm wrong.

215
00:20:53,503 --> 00:20:55,756
Look me in the eyes.

216
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:02,888
I've told you what you should do.

217
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:04,389
Give this up.

218
00:21:04,473 --> 00:21:05,807
Go to the police.

219
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:07,643
Face what you've done.

220
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:12,564
If you want to run, run.

221
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:15,191
But me?

222
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,695
No way, I will not run away.

223
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:24,242
Nice to meet you, young lady.

224
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:08,078
- Kim, something's come up with Tucumcari.
- Not now, Stef.

225
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:10,497
- I wouldn't bother you, but...
- I asked you to handle it.

226
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:14,209
- We are, but there's...
- Stef, this is not the time, all right?

227
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:23,343
Okay.

228
00:22:23,427 --> 00:22:24,761
Okay.

229
00:22:24,845 --> 00:22:27,723
Miss Wexler, I've reviewed your motion
to dismiss

230
00:22:27,806 --> 00:22:30,642
and the state's one-page response.

231
00:22:31,643 --> 00:22:35,063
Your argument is well-reasoned.
However, I'm denying the motion.

232
00:22:35,147 --> 00:22:36,815
Your Honour, I'd like to remind you

233
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:39,151
that this was nothing more
than a family dispute.

234
00:22:39,234 --> 00:22:41,111
- My client was...
- Yeah, I'll stop you there.

235
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:44,114
This is not your client's first
negative interaction with the victim,

236
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:45,657
which shows pattern of behaviour.

237
00:22:45,741 --> 00:22:47,743
And as such,
I still agree with the state

238
00:22:47,826 --> 00:22:49,870
that this matter
is worth the court's time.

239
00:22:49,953 --> 00:22:52,164
- Your Honour...
- Jury selection begins June 16th.

240
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,252
I'm sorry this didn't go our way.

241
00:22:57,335 --> 00:23:00,672
Going in, we all knew getting
the case dismissed would be a long shot.

242
00:23:00,756 --> 00:23:02,758
The judge seemed kind of mad.

243
00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:06,970
Yeah, she can come off that way,
but she is actually very fair.

244
00:23:07,054 --> 00:23:10,599
So now, the prosecution will come back
to us with a more realistic plea bargain,

245
00:23:10,682 --> 00:23:14,144
but if we don't like what they have
to offer, I believe we'll win at trial.

246
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:15,812
What does that mean?

247
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:17,773
We'll have a chance to explain
what happened,

248
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:19,357
in front of a jury of regular people.

249
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:23,653
Look, you were trying to do a good thing,
and I think they'll see that.

250
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:25,489
Just keep the faith, okay?

251
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:27,908
- Okay.
- I'm sorry. I'll be right back.

252
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:30,869
It's Rich. This is the second time
he's called.

253
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:33,288
Hey, Rich.

254
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:36,833
I'm confused. I thought you'd be
on your way to Tucumcari by now.

255
00:23:36,917 --> 00:23:39,002
- Rich...
- I just got off with Kevin Wachtell.

256
00:23:39,086 --> 00:23:41,421
He wants you there now
to straighten this out, hands on.

257
00:23:41,505 --> 00:23:44,132
Well, I'm flattered,
but my clients need me.

258
00:23:44,216 --> 00:23:46,093
I have a full day of appearances here.

259
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:49,679
Well, all I can tell you,
he's called twice in 40 minutes.

260
00:23:49,763 --> 00:23:51,848
I promise you, Tucumcari's under control.

261
00:23:51,932 --> 00:23:53,725
The associates are more than capable.

262
00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:57,479
Help me understand. It's not like
you're in the middle of a murder trial.

263
00:23:57,562 --> 00:23:59,606
Rich, this is just Kevin being Kevin.

264
00:23:59,689 --> 00:24:02,567
Don't get me wrong, I respect
your devotion to your pro bono clients,

265
00:24:02,651 --> 00:24:05,195
but Mesa Verde keeps the lights on.

266
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:06,404
Can we agree on that?

267
00:24:09,366 --> 00:24:10,700
Of course.

268
00:24:10,784 --> 00:24:12,160
We've all been here.

269
00:24:12,244 --> 00:24:15,122
Once in a while, you have to give
a little to get a little, you know?

270
00:24:17,415 --> 00:24:19,042
Viola's already briefed Stef and Gary.

271
00:24:19,126 --> 00:24:21,962
They'll take your afternoon cases
and get continuances if necessary,

272
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:24,047
so get yourself down there, stat.

273
00:24:26,216 --> 00:24:28,927
All right. I'm on my way.

274
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:52,534
Who the hell are you?

275
00:24:58,373 --> 00:25:01,293
Now, thank you, officer.
We'll let you know when we're done.

276
00:25:07,632 --> 00:25:08,800
Sit.

277
00:25:11,303 --> 00:25:12,304
Who are you?

278
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:22,856
I'm your new lawyer.

279
00:25:24,858 --> 00:25:27,527
- I didn't call no lawyer.
- No, you didn't.

280
00:25:27,611 --> 00:25:28,653
Lalo did.

281
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:33,825
I didn't say anything to no one.
I kept my mouth shut.

282
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:36,661
I know, I know. Don't worry, kid.

283
00:25:36,745 --> 00:25:38,705
I'm nothing but good news for you.

284
00:25:39,748 --> 00:25:42,167
All right, we got a lot to go over here.

285
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,462
How are you at memorisation?

286
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:41,393
Excuse me.

287
00:26:42,602 --> 00:26:44,813
Hey, Myrna. How's the boy?

288
00:26:44,896 --> 00:26:47,607
- He's good, Hank.
- He's, what, third base?

289
00:26:47,691 --> 00:26:49,859
- Catcher.
- Catcher.

290
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:53,113
- Hey, Steve.
- Looking good, Myrna.

291
00:26:56,574 --> 00:26:58,285
Let me ask you something.

292
00:26:58,368 --> 00:27:01,997
Does Blanca throw stuff out
on the exact day it expires?

293
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,623
Like what?

294
00:27:03,707 --> 00:27:07,002
Anything. Milk, ketchup, soy sauce.

295
00:27:07,085 --> 00:27:09,546
As the clock literally strikes midnight,

296
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:13,508
Marie hands me a full Hefty bag
and pushes me out to the trash cans.

297
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:16,136
I mean, you know, most of it's still good.

298
00:27:16,219 --> 00:27:17,429
What the hell?

299
00:27:17,512 --> 00:27:19,973
Food banks don't take expired food.

300
00:27:20,056 --> 00:27:22,183
Oh, thanks for that, Ann Landers.

301
00:27:22,267 --> 00:27:26,521
Once I found an old can of vanilla
frosting. I ate that. I'm still here.

302
00:27:28,606 --> 00:27:29,566
You what?

303
00:27:29,567 --> 00:27:33,321
Hey, we were talking about expired food.
I thought it was relevant.

304
00:27:36,948 --> 00:27:39,159
Let's get this circle jerk over with.

305
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:05,352
Alrighty.

306
00:28:05,435 --> 00:28:07,354
Domingo Molina.

307
00:28:08,813 --> 00:28:13,443
Picked up for possession
of half ounce of street grade gak.

308
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:15,445
That's dealing weight.

309
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:18,448
Keeps his mouth shut
for the first two nights he's in here,

310
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:22,577
and now has an epiphany and wants to talk.

311
00:28:24,371 --> 00:28:25,372
Okay.

312
00:28:26,456 --> 00:28:28,333
Wow me.

313
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:31,461
Make my tiny eyes grow wide with delight.

314
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:38,176
What if I know where there's
half a million in drug money?

315
00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:39,719
What if?

316
00:28:40,595 --> 00:28:42,597
What if?

317
00:28:43,932 --> 00:28:47,560
If that's true,
things could go well for you.

318
00:28:47,644 --> 00:28:51,648
My partner's right. That kind of
information can lead to good things.

319
00:28:54,192 --> 00:28:55,944
Give me the deets.

320
00:28:56,027 --> 00:28:59,489
Where the drugs come from,
who the money goes to,

321
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:03,034
the name of your boss
and who you report to.

322
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:05,578
For starters.

323
00:29:08,706 --> 00:29:09,791
Okay.

324
00:29:14,087 --> 00:29:17,132
The dealers kick up the cash, right?

325
00:29:17,215 --> 00:29:19,843
But they don't go face-to-face
with the big guys,

326
00:29:19,926 --> 00:29:22,220
so they leave it in different spots.

327
00:29:22,303 --> 00:29:24,097
- Dead drops?
- Yeah.

328
00:29:25,557 --> 00:29:27,851
Sounds like a big operation.

329
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:30,103
Hello! Hey.

330
00:29:30,186 --> 00:29:31,646
Silence.

331
00:29:31,729 --> 00:29:33,815
Were you talking to them?

332
00:29:33,898 --> 00:29:36,943
Were you talking to my client
without his lawyer present?

333
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,778
And you are?

334
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:42,657
Saul Goodman.
I'm Mr. Molina's attorney.

335
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:46,035
And you're in violation
of his constitutional rights.

336
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:48,329
Saul. It's all good, man.

337
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:52,459
- Really? Come on. That's your name?
- Listen, officer...

338
00:29:52,542 --> 00:29:54,961
Special agent.

339
00:29:55,044 --> 00:29:56,421
Oh, the DEA?

340
00:29:56,504 --> 00:29:58,923
Oh, I see, okay. The feds.

341
00:29:59,007 --> 00:30:02,260
Well, what, they don't teach
the Constitution at Quantico these days?

342
00:30:02,343 --> 00:30:03,553
Yeah. Quantico is FBI.

343
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:07,265
I don't care. DEA, FBI,
Department of Sanitation.

344
00:30:07,348 --> 00:30:09,809
It's time for you two gentlemen
to vacate the premises.

345
00:30:09,893 --> 00:30:11,394
There's the door. Shoo, shoo.

346
00:30:11,478 --> 00:30:12,394
Go away.

347
00:30:12,395 --> 00:30:14,523
Your client waived
his right to an attorney.

348
00:30:14,606 --> 00:30:16,399
Whoa, he most certainly did not.

349
00:30:16,483 --> 00:30:20,195
- Yeah, I did.
- Zip it, okay? Nobody's talking to you.

350
00:30:20,278 --> 00:30:23,907
- Well, he wants to talk to us.
- He... He's confused, okay?

351
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:26,409
- He was dropped on his head as a child.
- I wanna talk.

352
00:30:26,493 --> 00:30:27,911
- No, you don't!
- Yeah, I do.

353
00:30:27,994 --> 00:30:29,662
Sounds like he does.

354
00:30:29,746 --> 00:30:32,916
You just... One... One moment.
Come... Come here.

355
00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:34,834
Just come here.

356
00:30:38,505 --> 00:30:40,900
Do you know...?
And we just discussed this, okay?

357
00:30:40,924 --> 00:30:42,175
You don't talk to...

358
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,512
I'm doing my job.

359
00:30:45,595 --> 00:30:47,555
Which is protecting you from you!

360
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:51,100
- I'm talking whether you like it or not.
- You're killing me here, man.

361
00:30:54,145 --> 00:30:55,522
Okay, look.

362
00:30:56,898 --> 00:31:01,694
My client is making
what I believe to be a grave error.

363
00:31:01,778 --> 00:31:05,114
Also showing a heartbreaking lack of faith
in his attorney.

364
00:31:05,198 --> 00:31:07,825
And I'm not gonna lie, it hurts.

365
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,250
He insists on dealing,
so let's talk turkey.

366
00:31:19,045 --> 00:31:20,755
You know what?

367
00:31:20,838 --> 00:31:22,590
We're not interested.

368
00:31:22,674 --> 00:31:24,259
I feel like my chain is being jerked,

369
00:31:24,342 --> 00:31:26,803
and not in a good way,
if you know what I'm saying.

370
00:31:26,886 --> 00:31:29,430
- There's no half mil. Never was.
- Yep.

371
00:31:29,514 --> 00:31:32,100
- Bullshit. I called it, Gomey, remember?
- You did.

372
00:31:32,183 --> 00:31:33,994
- Hold on.
- I'm gonna blow this popsicle...

373
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:35,746
- Wait a second.
- Have a great afternoon.

374
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:37,957
- Hold up, guys, one second.
- Hey, have a good day.

375
00:31:37,981 --> 00:31:39,691
- We're done in here.
- Guys...

376
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:42,902
What if we say it's contingent?

377
00:31:48,074 --> 00:31:49,909
Contingent?

378
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:51,327
On what?

379
00:31:51,411 --> 00:31:52,453
Results.

380
00:31:52,537 --> 00:31:54,122
Mr. Molina will stay in custody

381
00:31:54,205 --> 00:31:58,960
while you verify his very specific,
limited information.

382
00:31:59,043 --> 00:32:01,921
And what if what he tells us
doesn't pan out?

383
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:05,717
Oh, well, then he just stays here.
I mean, we're back where we started.

384
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,386
But if his information
leads to something...

385
00:32:08,469 --> 00:32:09,512
Arrests.

386
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:10,888
What?

387
00:32:11,556 --> 00:32:15,852
If his information leads to arrests.

388
00:32:21,649 --> 00:32:22,567
Well, yeah.

389
00:32:22,568 --> 00:32:27,530
Well, if his information leads to arrests,
then the charges go away.

390
00:32:27,614 --> 00:32:32,201
Okay? Now, how can you say no to that?
That is a win-win for you guys.

391
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,337
Give us another minute.

392
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,420
Good.

393
00:32:46,382 --> 00:32:48,801
Okay, Domingo.

394
00:32:48,885 --> 00:32:49,927
Start talking.

395
00:32:51,304 --> 00:32:52,304
Go ahead.

396
00:32:53,806 --> 00:32:57,018
Like I said, the dealers kick up the cash.

397
00:32:58,645 --> 00:33:00,480
I don't know who picks it up.

398
00:33:00,563 --> 00:33:03,608
All I know is that there are these
three dead drops on Thursday nights...

399
00:33:03,691 --> 00:33:04,984
- Hold on.
- What... What?

400
00:33:05,068 --> 00:33:07,445
Look, I know how this goes, all right?

401
00:33:07,528 --> 00:33:10,323
My guy talks to you,
you squeeze him out like a sponge,

402
00:33:10,406 --> 00:33:12,617
then you dump him back on the street.

403
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:16,162
Word gets out that he's a fink, he ends up
bleeding out at his mother's house.

404
00:33:16,245 --> 00:33:18,915
- What?
- No. It's not gonna happen, okay?

405
00:33:18,998 --> 00:33:23,378
Do you hear what I'm saying? My client is
not leaving with a target on his back.

406
00:33:34,013 --> 00:33:36,849
Fine. We'll take care of him.

407
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:41,229
Assuming this isn't one big jag-off.

408
00:33:41,312 --> 00:33:46,734
It'll look like he got out
because his lawyer's a genius.

409
00:33:46,818 --> 00:33:50,613
Okay. And he's... He's not
just anyone's CI either, all right?

410
00:33:50,697 --> 00:33:53,449
You don't pass him around
like a venereal disease.

411
00:33:53,533 --> 00:33:55,493
He's your personal CI.

412
00:33:55,576 --> 00:33:59,497
So he gets picked up, he calls me,
I call you, gets taken care of.

413
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,332
No questions asked.

414
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:04,293
Okay.

415
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:06,629
But it's contingent.

416
00:34:06,713 --> 00:34:09,298
- Sure.
- And this better be worth it.

417
00:34:12,385 --> 00:34:13,720
Yeah.

418
00:34:13,803 --> 00:34:14,803
Okay.

419
00:34:16,222 --> 00:34:19,892
So, like I said,
there are these three dead drops.

420
00:34:19,976 --> 00:34:23,980
The first one's under a bridge
up by Chavez Road, over Hillsdale Street.

421
00:34:24,063 --> 00:34:29,152
The second one's in an empty rail yard
off Waldren in a train shed. There's a...

422
00:34:40,288 --> 00:34:41,330
Oh, thank God.

423
00:34:44,876 --> 00:34:46,085
Is he home?

424
00:34:46,169 --> 00:34:48,546
Yeah, he never seems to leave.

425
00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:53,134
- A word of warning, he's very unpleasant.
- Got it.

426
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:08,024
Mr. Acker, I think you're home!

427
00:35:10,568 --> 00:35:13,362
My name is Kim Wexler,
and I'd really like to talk to you!

428
00:35:26,584 --> 00:35:28,753
Mr. Acker, hello.

429
00:35:28,836 --> 00:35:30,338
Thanks for speaking with me.

430
00:35:30,421 --> 00:35:31,798
There's been a misunderstanding,

431
00:35:31,881 --> 00:35:34,842
and it's in everyone's best interest
if we straighten it out.

432
00:35:34,926 --> 00:35:38,012
- May I come in?
- Stay right where you're at.

433
00:35:56,113 --> 00:35:57,198
Okay.

434
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:08,209
As I understand it, you and your family
have been here since 1974.

435
00:36:09,544 --> 00:36:13,840
You built this lovely house, but you
never actually owned the land it was on.

436
00:36:13,923 --> 00:36:17,301
It was leased to you by a local company,
Deerview Investment Properties.

437
00:36:17,385 --> 00:36:19,470
For a hundred years.

438
00:36:19,554 --> 00:36:21,472
I got 70 left.

439
00:36:21,556 --> 00:36:27,520
That's correct. However, and I know this
may be difficult to wrap your head around,

440
00:36:27,603 --> 00:36:31,649
your lease stipulates that the property
owner can buy you out at any time

441
00:36:31,732 --> 00:36:34,694
for fair market value plus $5000.

442
00:36:34,777 --> 00:36:39,198
I know $5000 isn't nearly as much
as it used to be back in 1974, and...

443
00:36:39,282 --> 00:36:41,075
And we do understand how...

444
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:44,620
inconvenient this must be.

445
00:36:44,704 --> 00:36:45,955
So, as a gesture of goodwill,

446
00:36:46,038 --> 00:36:50,251
Mesa Verde has just increased
your buy-out to $18,000.

447
00:36:50,334 --> 00:36:52,795
Eighteen thousand dollars?

448
00:36:52,879 --> 00:36:53,795
That's right.

449
00:36:53,796 --> 00:36:57,342
Well, nobody's ever explained it to me
like that before.

450
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:02,805
Eighteen thousand dollars,
that's a lot of money.

451
00:37:04,223 --> 00:37:08,936
I bet you, with that, I could buy
a big old mansion and a swimming pool.

452
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:11,689
- Mr. Acker, we know it's not enough...
- Do me a favour, will you?

453
00:37:11,772 --> 00:37:15,568
I'm gonna spread my legs out like this,

454
00:37:15,651 --> 00:37:19,864
and just to finish it off, why don't you
give me a swift kick in the balls?

455
00:37:19,947 --> 00:37:21,490
That's not necessary.

456
00:37:21,574 --> 00:37:26,203
You people are all the same.
You're soulless money grubbers.

457
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:29,373
Please, Mr. Acker,
how about we just discuss this, civil?

458
00:37:29,457 --> 00:37:32,835
Adverse possession means this is my land.

459
00:37:32,919 --> 00:37:35,630
You made that argument in court,
and the judge ruled against you.

460
00:37:35,713 --> 00:37:39,800
Yeah, and nobody could change my mind,
so they sent you out.

461
00:37:39,884 --> 00:37:42,011
You're the big gun,

462
00:37:42,094 --> 00:37:44,305
with a ponytail.

463
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:49,268
Oh, you're just like all the rest of them,

464
00:37:49,352 --> 00:37:52,605
coming out here in your fancy suit,

465
00:37:52,688 --> 00:37:59,688
bring your minions with you,
driving them black, shiny German cars.

466
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:05,451
And you think you can talk to me
like I'm brain damaged?

467
00:38:05,534 --> 00:38:07,662
N.O.

468
00:38:07,745 --> 00:38:08,745
No!

469
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:14,669
That big bank thinks it's gonna
build a call centre.

470
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:17,170
So...

471
00:38:18,589 --> 00:38:23,511
you go around throwing people
out of their homes.

472
00:38:23,594 --> 00:38:26,305
Well, not this house, sweetheart!

473
00:38:29,475 --> 00:38:30,475
All right.

474
00:38:31,602 --> 00:38:33,688
I can see you've made up your mind.

475
00:38:33,771 --> 00:38:36,232
- Have a good day.
- And I can see you.

476
00:38:38,109 --> 00:38:43,739
You're one of those people that give
a little money to charity every month,

477
00:38:43,823 --> 00:38:47,326
so you can make up
for all the bad that you've done.

478
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:51,664
You go to a soup kitchen
once a year on Thanksgiving.

479
00:38:51,747 --> 00:38:54,875
That makes you feel
a whole lot better about yourself.

480
00:38:54,959 --> 00:38:58,462
Makes you feel like
one of the best rich people.

481
00:39:01,424 --> 00:39:06,220
Oh, I don't know how in the world
you sleep at night.

482
00:39:17,064 --> 00:39:18,399
Listen to me.

483
00:39:18,482 --> 00:39:21,068
You do not get to make up your own rules.

484
00:39:22,445 --> 00:39:28,617
Put on your big boy pants and face
reality. No one is mistreating you here.

485
00:39:28,701 --> 00:39:30,411
We were trying to meet you halfway.

486
00:39:30,494 --> 00:39:32,913
Well, that's over.

487
00:39:32,997 --> 00:39:36,584
The $18,000, guess what?
It's off the table.

488
00:39:36,667 --> 00:39:39,670
Tomorrow you come to your senses?
You'll get 10.

489
00:39:40,838 --> 00:39:42,423
And you know what happens after that?

490
00:39:42,506 --> 00:39:45,051
The sheriff comes out
and kicks you out of here.

491
00:39:45,134 --> 00:39:47,344
And you get nothing.

492
00:39:47,428 --> 00:39:51,724
Why should you get to drag this out for
seven months while all of your neighbours,

493
00:39:51,807 --> 00:39:54,852
every single one of them,
played by the rules?

494
00:39:54,935 --> 00:39:57,938
And do you...? Do you...?
Do you think you're special?

495
00:39:59,023 --> 00:40:01,859
A contract means something.

496
00:40:01,942 --> 00:40:05,196
It's the law, and it's enforceable.

497
00:40:05,279 --> 00:40:06,279
Deal with it.

498
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:16,624
- That was amazing. Great job.
- I didn't solve anything.

499
00:40:16,707 --> 00:40:20,211
You ended it. That's what we needed.

500
00:41:02,837 --> 00:41:04,672
You hear that?

501
00:41:04,755 --> 00:41:07,883
I replaced the carburettor.
She's running like a racehorse, man.

502
00:41:07,967 --> 00:41:10,427
It's a fine vehicle.
That's a thing of beauty.

503
00:41:10,511 --> 00:41:13,055
Yeah? What do you drive?

504
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:14,140
An Esteem.

505
00:41:15,558 --> 00:41:16,851
A what?

506
00:41:16,934 --> 00:41:20,104
A Suzuki Esteem, it's an import.

507
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:24,817
- So?
- Yeah, so it went just like you wanted.

508
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:28,237
Assuming the dead drops are a real thing,
the feds are gonna be on them.

509
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,948
- The feds?
- Yeah. DEA.

510
00:41:31,031 --> 00:41:33,868
There's a pair of them,
and they're into this with a vengeance.

511
00:41:33,951 --> 00:41:36,579
I mean, think feeding time
in the lion cage.

512
00:41:36,662 --> 00:41:40,958
And they're gunning for arrests.

513
00:41:41,792 --> 00:41:42,792
Okay.

514
00:41:44,336 --> 00:41:45,336
Oh, and...

515
00:41:46,297 --> 00:41:48,591
your guy is now a confidential informant.

516
00:41:48,674 --> 00:41:51,177
- What do you mean, like a rat?
- No, he's not a rat. No.

517
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:54,638
I mean. Well, if he's a rat,
he's your rat, so...

518
00:41:54,722 --> 00:41:58,225
Uh, put it this way,
you now have a hotline to the DEA.

519
00:41:58,309 --> 00:42:00,227
And not just now, anytime.

520
00:42:00,311 --> 00:42:02,688
So that's a good thing, right?

521
00:42:02,771 --> 00:42:07,401
But the deal is, at some point,
you might hear that Domingo is a snitch.

522
00:42:07,484 --> 00:42:10,154
You... You gotta know he's not.

523
00:42:12,364 --> 00:42:13,616
And what do you care?

524
00:42:15,492 --> 00:42:18,120
Well, all due respect,
you're paying me, but he's my client.

525
00:42:18,204 --> 00:42:19,830
I'd like to keep him alive.

526
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:25,169
This dude. Good idea.

527
00:42:26,879 --> 00:42:29,673
And one more thing.

528
00:42:29,757 --> 00:42:32,384
You have to find a different attorney
for future endeavours,

529
00:42:32,468 --> 00:42:35,179
because my schedule
is just very, very tight.

530
00:42:38,265 --> 00:42:39,642
You'll make time.

531
00:42:56,116 --> 00:42:58,619
Who exactly did I just set up?

532
00:42:59,954 --> 00:43:01,538
You don't wanna know.

533
00:43:01,622 --> 00:43:05,167
I mean, if there's gonna be blowback,
I don't want to be in the middle of it.

534
00:43:05,251 --> 00:43:07,628
It's not about what you want.

535
00:43:07,711 --> 00:43:08,754
When you're in...

536
00:43:10,422 --> 00:43:11,422
you're in.

537
00:43:48,919 --> 00:43:49,919
And Martinez?

538
00:43:49,962 --> 00:43:52,172
We got a continuance.

539
00:43:52,256 --> 00:43:53,966
Good. Davenport?

540
00:43:54,049 --> 00:43:56,927
- The judge read your motion and dismissed.
- Yes.

541
00:43:57,011 --> 00:43:58,929
Oh, and I got a continuance on Russo.

542
00:43:59,013 --> 00:44:00,773
His hearing's scheduled
for Thursday morning?

543
00:44:00,806 --> 00:44:02,474
Yep. Viola put it in your calendar.

544
00:44:02,558 --> 00:44:04,059
Good. What about Ingram?

545
00:44:04,143 --> 00:44:06,103
He didn't show.

546
00:44:06,186 --> 00:44:08,022
Did you call all three numbers?

547
00:44:08,105 --> 00:44:09,690
I called the first one.

548
00:44:09,773 --> 00:44:11,942
Call all three.
The bottom number is his aunt.

549
00:44:12,026 --> 00:44:14,737
- She usually knows where he is.
- I'm sorry.

550
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:16,947
- I got a continuance.
- That's okay.

551
00:44:17,031 --> 00:44:18,711
Call his aunt and make sure
he's all right,

552
00:44:18,782 --> 00:44:22,661
and ask how I can get in touch with him
before his hearing.

553
00:44:22,745 --> 00:44:25,080
If she doesn't,
call the Rescue Mission Shelter on 2nd.

554
00:44:25,164 --> 00:44:26,665
That's his backup.

555
00:44:26,749 --> 00:44:27,749
Will do.

556
00:44:29,918 --> 00:44:32,796
- All right. Good job, Stef.
- Thanks, Kim.

557
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,007
- Get home safe.
- Yep. Have a good evening.

558
00:45:26,809 --> 00:45:27,976
Mr. Acker?

559
00:45:29,311 --> 00:45:30,771
It's Kim Wexler again.

560
00:45:32,231 --> 00:45:33,857
I'd really like another word with you.

561
00:45:58,257 --> 00:45:59,466
Mr. Acker?

562
00:46:23,866 --> 00:46:25,117
Mr. Acker?

563
00:46:27,077 --> 00:46:30,122
I'm sorry, I... I entered your property.

564
00:46:32,416 --> 00:46:34,126
I'd really like to talk to you.

565
00:46:50,434 --> 00:46:51,434
Hi.

566
00:46:52,978 --> 00:46:54,062
Can we start over?

567
00:46:55,689 --> 00:47:00,444
- Say what you came to say.
- I went to a real estate office.

568
00:47:00,527 --> 00:47:02,613
I found some houses
I think you might like.

569
00:47:04,781 --> 00:47:08,035
There are some really nice options
in your price range.

570
00:47:12,873 --> 00:47:14,500
This one's on half an acre.

571
00:47:16,793 --> 00:47:23,509
And this one is older,
but it has a really good view.

572
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:26,470
And the neighbourhood's pretty.

573
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:31,099
I know moving's a big deal.

574
00:47:31,183 --> 00:47:34,895
I'd like to help you out with that myself,
if that's all right with you.

575
00:47:34,978 --> 00:47:38,607
I can take off any day this week,
and I'll pay for it out of my own pocket.

576
00:47:42,528 --> 00:47:45,822
This one has three bedrooms.

577
00:47:49,993 --> 00:47:54,289
I know you don't wanna move, but
whatever house you choose will be yours.

578
00:47:54,373 --> 00:47:56,416
You'll own it, and the land, forever.

579
00:48:08,887 --> 00:48:11,974
You're right. I can't pretend to
understand what you're going through.

580
00:48:12,975 --> 00:48:15,644
I've never owned a house.

581
00:48:15,727 --> 00:48:17,271
My family never owned one either.

582
00:48:17,354 --> 00:48:20,065
We never owned anything.

583
00:48:21,608 --> 00:48:24,444
When I was little, my mother used
to shake me awake in the night,

584
00:48:24,528 --> 00:48:26,530
yelling it was time to go.

585
00:48:27,906 --> 00:48:30,284
She was always one step ahead
of the landlord.

586
00:48:32,077 --> 00:48:38,458
I'd throw my things in a cardboard box and
run outside in my pyjamas and bare feet.

587
00:48:39,835 --> 00:48:40,836
Sometimes...

588
00:48:42,504 --> 00:48:43,714
it was so cold...

589
00:48:46,133 --> 00:48:47,801
my to... my toes turned blue.

590
00:48:58,562 --> 00:49:01,607
If we'd had a house,
I never would've wanted to leave.

591
00:49:08,447 --> 00:49:10,324
You'll say anything...

592
00:49:11,867 --> 00:49:14,161
to get what you want, won't you?

593
00:50:03,669 --> 00:50:04,961
When was this?

594
00:50:05,045 --> 00:50:06,672
Today.

595
00:50:06,755 --> 00:50:09,383
Do you have the agents' names?

596
00:50:09,466 --> 00:50:10,801
The lawyer's got them.

597
00:50:16,973 --> 00:50:17,973
What are you doing?

598
00:50:19,226 --> 00:50:21,311
Shutting it down.

599
00:50:21,395 --> 00:50:22,395
Put it away.

600
00:50:27,025 --> 00:50:29,194
You wanna leave the money for the feds?

601
00:50:32,322 --> 00:50:34,825
If there's no money in those dead drops...

602
00:50:36,576 --> 00:50:39,121
Lalo will know someone talked.

603
00:50:51,174 --> 00:50:52,759
The dead drops remain.
