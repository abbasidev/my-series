1
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:29,864
Where is this place?

2
00:00:29,948 --> 00:00:30,949
Where am I?

3
00:00:32,075 --> 00:00:33,660
I don't speak English.

4
00:00:34,661 --> 00:00:36,037
Sit down, please.

5
00:00:37,122 --> 00:00:38,122
Phone?

6
00:00:38,998 --> 00:00:41,668
No, local calls only.

7
00:00:42,711 --> 00:00:45,922
Please, be careful.
You should not be moving around.

8
00:00:46,005 --> 00:00:47,465
The doctor will come soon.

9
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:49,676
Who brought me here?

10
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:51,302
Did Fring do this?

11
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:55,807
Gustavo Fring.

12
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,976
Sit down.

13
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:00,173
I will get you a glass of water.

14
00:01:37,766 --> 00:01:40,810
HIGHWAY 2.5 MILES

15
00:02:55,093 --> 00:02:57,428
Look what you've done to all my fine work.

16
00:02:59,931 --> 00:03:02,225
What am I doing here?

17
00:03:03,393 --> 00:03:05,436
You were meant to be recovering.

18
00:03:06,938 --> 00:03:08,439
What's he want with me?

19
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,193
He's asked me to keep you alive.

20
00:03:13,945 --> 00:03:16,030
Will you allow this?

21
00:03:48,354 --> 00:03:50,315
Okay, listen up.

22
00:03:50,398 --> 00:03:54,152
If Acker doesn't leave on his own by
quarter after, the sheriff's gonna evict.

23
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:57,363
Once that's done,
utilities will drop and cut their lines

24
00:03:57,447 --> 00:03:59,282
while we take down the north fence.

25
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:02,660
Anything inside the place gets loaded up
and sent to storage.

26
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:06,039
Debris goes in the side dumpster.

27
00:04:06,122 --> 00:04:09,208
Concrete's staying.
Disposal company's coming for it.

28
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:12,712
- We good so far?
- I think I might be seeing a hitch here.

29
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:14,464
Wait, who are you?

30
00:04:14,547 --> 00:04:17,800
I'm Saul Goodman, attorney-at-law.
Glad to meet you.

31
00:04:17,884 --> 00:04:22,305
- A better question might be, where are we?
- What's that supposed to mean?

32
00:04:22,388 --> 00:04:23,473
Well, you know what?

33
00:04:23,556 --> 00:04:26,225
It's coming up on the hour,
so a word to the wise,

34
00:04:26,309 --> 00:04:30,480
if you let everyone go right now, you
might save half a day's salary in fringes.

35
00:04:30,563 --> 00:04:32,649
What the hell are you talking about?

36
00:04:34,859 --> 00:04:37,862
Deputies, great. Perfect timing.

37
00:04:37,946 --> 00:04:41,074
- What's going on?
- He's a lawyer, says he has a hitch.

38
00:04:41,157 --> 00:04:44,744
I'm Everett Acker's attorney, I'm just
dotting the I's in due diligence.

39
00:04:44,827 --> 00:04:47,914
Well, I'm sorry, sir.
The eviction order's signed by a judge.

40
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:50,500
I'm sure it is.
Can I have a peek at that?

41
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:53,419
It's all correct, sir.

42
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:58,549
Sir, since you represent Mr. Acker, can you
make sure he cooperates with the eviction?

43
00:04:58,633 --> 00:05:01,177
Can you make out the address on that?

44
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:06,307
1130 Arroyo Vista. Is there a problem?

45
00:05:06,391 --> 00:05:08,768
Well, I mean, is that where we are?

46
00:05:13,064 --> 00:05:17,151
There were house numbers on that mailbox,
plain as day. Eleven-thirty.

47
00:05:17,235 --> 00:05:18,653
I don't see any.

48
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:19,904
Do you, deputy?

49
00:05:19,988 --> 00:05:21,239
No. I don't.

50
00:05:21,322 --> 00:05:24,993
Well, somebody messed with them.
This is 1130 Arroyo Vista.

51
00:05:25,076 --> 00:05:28,705
This here's 1240 Arroyo Vista.

52
00:05:28,788 --> 00:05:31,582
It's always been 1240 Arroyo Vista.

53
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:34,293
- Twelve-forty?
- Twelve-forty.

54
00:05:34,377 --> 00:05:36,713
My client says it's 1240.

55
00:05:36,796 --> 00:05:39,048
I got a plat map,
says we can straighten this out.

56
00:05:39,132 --> 00:05:41,092
Well, all due respect
to whoever drew that map,

57
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:43,594
but Mr. Acker's been living here
for 30 years.

58
00:05:43,678 --> 00:05:45,221
I think he knows his own address.

59
00:05:46,014 --> 00:05:48,182
Sir, you got something
with an address on it?

60
00:06:02,238 --> 00:06:03,656
Thank you.

61
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:10,913
1240 Arroyo Vista.

62
00:06:10,997 --> 00:06:13,499
It's 1130. Anybody can print out
something like that.

63
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,103
You've got an order signed by a judge.

64
00:06:15,168 --> 00:06:18,796
You know, we could get a surveyor up here
this afternoon. He'll clear everything up.

65
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,382
- That would lose us a full day.
- Listen, officer.

66
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:23,217
Before you go forcing an elderly veteran

67
00:06:23,301 --> 00:06:25,219
from his home
and take everything he's got,

68
00:06:25,303 --> 00:06:27,513
demolish a half century of hard work,

69
00:06:27,597 --> 00:06:30,058
wouldn't you like to know
you got the right place?

70
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:36,606
Come on, all we're talking about
are some missing house numbers.

71
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:40,610
I have to make a call.

72
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:51,037
Everybody take 10!

73
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:03,925
After a year of running every
which way, now the guy gets a lawyer?

74
00:07:04,008 --> 00:07:06,427
The lawyer comes in, the crazy comes out.

75
00:07:06,511 --> 00:07:08,888
We had it straightened out
in a matter of hours.

76
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:11,682
It was a gimmick,
and not a particularly effective one.

77
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:15,686
It's costing us a day.
I call that plenty effective.

78
00:07:17,313 --> 00:07:22,360
But we're past that. Tomorrow they're
finally tearing the place down, right?

79
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:24,570
That's the plan.

80
00:07:25,905 --> 00:07:27,615
There's more?

81
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:29,992
Unfortunately,
there is another complication.

82
00:07:30,993 --> 00:07:34,455
The lawyer Acker hired, it's Jimmy.

83
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:38,376
Jimmy? Your Jimmy?

84
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:39,919
Yes.

85
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:42,296
How did that happen?

86
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,715
Jimmy's been doing
some very aggressive marketing.

87
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:47,844
Looks like Acker picked up on it.

88
00:07:49,762 --> 00:07:51,848
Okay, so, what now?

89
00:07:54,392 --> 00:07:56,519
In fairness to you, I'll withdraw

90
00:07:56,602 --> 00:07:59,230
from everything having to do
with the Tucumcari project.

91
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:01,941
Stef will step in for me.
She and Paige can see it through.

92
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:05,862
Kim's brought us this far.
I think Stef will do a fine job for us.

93
00:08:05,945 --> 00:08:08,197
Of course, this is just Tucumcari
we're talking about.

94
00:08:08,281 --> 00:08:10,950
I'll continue to handle everything else
as usual.

95
00:08:13,786 --> 00:08:14,829
You know what?

96
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,707
I smell a rat.

97
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,003
Acker hiring Jimmy, that's no coincidence.

98
00:08:22,086 --> 00:08:25,131
And I heard about the talking-to
you gave that guy.

99
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:27,008
Sounds like you tore him a new one.

100
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:29,802
- I... I wouldn't say that I...
- Here's what I think.

101
00:08:29,886 --> 00:08:32,388
This fella saw you for the killer you are,

102
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:36,809
and he went and hired Jimmy specifically
to take you away from us.

103
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:40,478
Kevin, I...

104
00:08:41,314 --> 00:08:44,025
I have to say,
I think that's very unlikely.

105
00:08:44,108 --> 00:08:46,944
Trust me on this, Kim.
I know a scam when I see one, okay?

106
00:08:47,028 --> 00:08:49,989
No disrespect. I'm sure
your associate's more than capable.

107
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:55,620
But I am not gonna let this guy deprive me
of the best in the business.

108
00:08:57,121 --> 00:08:59,540
I think what Kim's trying to say is that

109
00:08:59,624 --> 00:09:02,710
going home to the attorney
on the other side of this matter

110
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:05,379
could get awkward for her.

111
00:09:06,714 --> 00:09:10,259
Is that right, Kim?
This gonna be tough on you at home?

112
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:14,931
It's not the personal side
that concerns me.

113
00:09:15,014 --> 00:09:18,476
I just wouldn't want there to be
any question of conflict of interest.

114
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,353
Well, I'm not worried about that.

115
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,815
If you're willing to stick with it,
I say, why change horses midstream?

116
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:27,860
Kevin, are they waiting for you?

117
00:09:29,028 --> 00:09:30,613
Oh, yeah.

118
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:35,743
Listen. I need that call centre.
We gotta get this thing moving now.

119
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:39,038
We got a lot of competitors out there,
and none of them

120
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:41,082
are waiting on some
crabby, old son of a bitch

121
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:43,960
to get their damn call centres built.

122
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:48,089
- Got it?
- Got it.

123
00:09:52,385 --> 00:09:54,178
I know you do.

124
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,397
That an MRI machine
I saw back there?

125
00:10:05,648 --> 00:10:06,606
It is.

126
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:10,194
And Fring paid for all this.

127
00:10:12,655 --> 00:10:16,325
And all those
nice little houses out there,

128
00:10:16,409 --> 00:10:19,078
I'm guessing there
are bales of meth inside.

129
00:10:20,413 --> 00:10:22,290
There are no drugs here.

130
00:10:22,373 --> 00:10:25,001
None, save the ones that I prescribe.

131
00:10:26,002 --> 00:10:29,005
No men with guns either.

132
00:10:31,549 --> 00:10:34,135
And if I wanna get back to where I belong?

133
00:10:35,261 --> 00:10:37,430
You're welcome to leave.

134
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:39,974
You'd go back to the road
where I found you.

135
00:10:40,975 --> 00:10:45,438
Five kilometres from here, there's a gate
that leads to the main road.

136
00:10:45,521 --> 00:10:47,148
There are men at that gate.

137
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:51,193
Those men have guns, I'm guessing.

138
00:10:51,277 --> 00:10:52,820
Perhaps.

139
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:54,572
I've never seen any weapons.

140
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:59,118
In any case, they will not stop you.

141
00:11:00,161 --> 00:11:04,123
Twelve kilometres up the highway,
there's a small town.

142
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,751
Bigger than this place, but small.

143
00:11:07,877 --> 00:11:09,670
There is a bus stop.

144
00:11:10,171 --> 00:11:11,797
Once you're on that bus...

145
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:16,719
you're perhaps a day from El Paso.

146
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:21,390
However...

147
00:11:22,475 --> 00:11:26,687
as you are now,
you would not survive the journey.

148
00:11:29,231 --> 00:11:32,234
My advice is to rest.

149
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:38,199
Enjoy some of Señora Cortazar's
excellent cooking.

150
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,410
And take in some clean air.

151
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:55,508
Fring carts me all the way down here.

152
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:58,552
Why?

153
00:11:58,636 --> 00:12:00,513
That I do not know.

154
00:12:00,596 --> 00:12:02,473
You would have to ask him.

155
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:06,435
So you're just his on-call quack?

156
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:10,398
I am the quack who saved your life.

157
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:14,985
This is for infection.

158
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:19,115
Two every four hours for the next week.
This is for the pain.

159
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:21,158
Take it when you need it.

160
00:12:21,242 --> 00:12:24,286
I'll be back to check on you
in three days.

161
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:31,627
Then, in a week or so,
perhaps you will be able to travel.

162
00:12:32,837 --> 00:12:36,424
I can get a message to your family.

163
00:12:37,425 --> 00:12:39,385
They're fine.

164
00:14:44,093 --> 00:14:47,096
DEDICATED TO MAX

165
00:15:19,587 --> 00:15:20,754
Hello, Howard.

166
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:23,382
Hi, Jimmy. This a bad time?

167
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:28,345
I'm a bit busy, to be honest, but...

168
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:30,681
what's up?

169
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:33,309
Just thinking about you.
How are you doing?

170
00:15:34,435 --> 00:15:35,435
Fine.

171
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:37,938
Glad to hear it.

172
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:41,108
So, what's up?

173
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:44,778
Just touching base,
to see if you had any thoughts

174
00:15:44,862 --> 00:15:46,864
on what we talked about.

175
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:49,158
What we talked about...

176
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:51,243
Oh, the job!

177
00:15:51,327 --> 00:15:55,497
Oh, yeah, no, I mean, hey, I've been
thinking of nothing else, really.

178
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:58,042
Glad to hear it.

179
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,543
Any conclusions?

180
00:15:59,627 --> 00:16:01,837
No. I'm just...
I'm mulling it over.

181
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,799
You know, reflecting, trying to give it
the consideration that it deserves.

182
00:16:05,883 --> 00:16:10,346
Fair enough. I'm ready
to discuss the details when you are.

183
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:12,931
- Sounds good.
- And Jimmy...

184
00:16:27,613 --> 00:16:29,156
Hey.

185
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:32,743
Smells interesting.

186
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:34,953
Oh, yeah, that's the curry.

187
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:37,247
I think it's our unlikely hero.

188
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:42,002
I'm gonna have to soak it overnight,
but it'll be ready first thing.

189
00:16:42,086 --> 00:16:45,881
- So how'd it go with Kevin?
- Well, I'm still on the case.

190
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:48,759
No shit. That's great!
What happened?

191
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:53,847
You know, the more I wanted to go,
the more he wanted me to stay.

192
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:57,309
- Yeah, but he was pissed, right?
- A little bit.

193
00:16:57,393 --> 00:16:58,769
Right, so where were you?

194
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:01,814
We were at his country club.

195
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:06,610
Cutting it close to tee time.
Pressure. That's excellent.

196
00:17:06,694 --> 00:17:09,947
- He had to move his game actually.
- I love it!

197
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,031
Right. Now what?

198
00:17:11,115 --> 00:17:14,076
You were sitting?
You were standing? I mean...

199
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:16,745
Paint a picture. Set the scene.

200
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:18,831
Come on.

201
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:25,003
Okay...

202
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:27,840
Paige and I meet him

203
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:29,675
outside the clubhouse.

204
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:36,724
And the three of us are at a table, and
he's over here like this, and he says...

205
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:37,807
Wait.

206
00:17:38,851 --> 00:17:40,352
He sits like that?

207
00:17:40,436 --> 00:17:43,939
- Yeah, he sits to the side.
- He's a side sitter?

208
00:17:45,107 --> 00:17:46,023
I guess so.

209
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:49,362
Okay, well, you never told me
that he was a side sitter.

210
00:17:49,445 --> 00:17:51,655
And that is gold.

211
00:17:51,739 --> 00:17:53,782
Now, go on.

212
00:17:53,866 --> 00:18:00,372
Okay, so he's sitting here,
and he says...

213
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:04,084
- I'm not gonna let him deprive...
- Wait, do the voice.

214
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:07,755
- I'm not gonna imitate him.
- Yes. Come on. Give me a nibble.

215
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:09,339
I mean, he's a good old boy, right?

216
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:11,842
So do he talk like this?

217
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:14,261
- No. No.
- Ding, dang, doo?

218
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:16,722
It's...

219
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:20,225
It's more like...

220
00:18:21,477 --> 00:18:26,106
Lawyer comes in, crazy comes out.

221
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:29,151
I need that call centre real bad.

222
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:31,028
Of course, Kevin.

223
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:33,739
- Wait, are you being me?
- Yes, this is you.

224
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:35,240
Yes. Go on. Go on.

225
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:42,956
Okay. I'm not gonna
let him deprive me. No, sirree.

226
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,041
Kim,

227
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:46,752
I need it sooner than yesterday, got it?

228
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:50,464
- But, Kevin...
- No, you do whatever it takes.

229
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:54,802
I don't like waiting one bit.
Never have, never will.

230
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:58,847
Bottom line, breaking ground.
More statues.

231
00:18:58,931 --> 00:19:01,934
Kim, you get him now.
Blah, blah, blah.

232
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:06,438
Blah, blah, blah.

233
00:19:10,234 --> 00:19:11,693
What?

234
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:14,613
Kevin?

235
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,659
Yes, Kim?

236
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:23,580
Would you care to take a shower with me?

237
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,000
Well, shoot.

238
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:30,212
I believe I would.

239
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:55,863
The international call cannot be placed.

240
00:21:01,178 --> 00:21:02,429
Gracias.

241
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:40,592
- Hello.
- You know who this is?

242
00:21:41,927 --> 00:21:44,680
How are you feeling?
Better, I trust?

243
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:50,060
You don't do anything without a reason.

244
00:21:51,061 --> 00:21:52,312
Why am I here?

245
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:55,565
Now is not a good time.

246
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:14,376
What's going on here?

247
00:22:16,003 --> 00:22:19,089
Sir, sir, please watch your step.
Stop right there!

248
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:21,216
- What the hell?
- Please stay out of the grid.

249
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:22,342
The what?

250
00:22:22,426 --> 00:22:26,221
The area marked by the stakes.
Step out of it, please.

251
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,848
So, what about it, doctor?

252
00:22:27,931 --> 00:22:32,811
Well, at a glance, I'd say
these pieces are likely contemporary.

253
00:22:32,894 --> 00:22:34,813
I'll bet they are.

254
00:22:34,896 --> 00:22:37,941
But we need to do
a systematic property search to be sure.

255
00:22:38,025 --> 00:22:40,193
Really? Is that necessary?

256
00:22:40,277 --> 00:22:43,905
- I'm afraid so.
- How long is this gonna take?

257
00:22:43,989 --> 00:22:47,701
- A day or two. A week at the most.
- A week?

258
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:50,787
Come on.
You know this guy planted that stuff here.

259
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:54,332
This is the same thing
with the house numbers, all over!

260
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:56,877
No, that was an honest mistake.
This is the law!

261
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,878
Says who?

262
00:22:57,879 --> 00:23:01,381
Says the New Mexico
Cultural Properties Act.

263
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:04,468
No.

264
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:08,430
You're not going along
with this. Seriously?

265
00:23:11,683 --> 00:23:13,894
I have to make a call.

266
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,873
Sorry to interrupt.

267
00:23:34,956 --> 00:23:37,501
He's suing on
behalf of the water district.

268
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:39,586
The water district?

269
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:46,593
Stef, you're good with regulatory law.

270
00:23:46,676 --> 00:23:51,640
He's claiming there's a flaw
in the original land grant from 1846.

271
00:23:51,723 --> 00:23:54,017
That's ridiculous.

272
00:23:57,979 --> 00:24:00,732
Pat, you better drop everything else.

273
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:05,445
He's claiming our prime contractor
is an escaped felon.

274
00:24:05,529 --> 00:24:07,697
You can't be serious.

275
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:11,244
Evan, I'm gonna give this one to you.

276
00:24:55,495 --> 00:24:58,832
- I can see the Little Dipper.
- That's the Big Dipper.

277
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:00,584
Yeah.

278
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:10,302
Ah, right over here.
Is that Orion over there?

279
00:25:10,385 --> 00:25:11,803
No. That's a satellite.

280
00:25:22,564 --> 00:25:25,442
Officer, radiation's borderline.

281
00:25:25,525 --> 00:25:27,485
We gotta get soil samples.

282
00:25:31,781 --> 00:25:32,824
Do I have to ask?

283
00:25:32,908 --> 00:25:35,118
I'm gonna have to...

284
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:37,662
You know.

285
00:25:38,663 --> 00:25:40,165
Better safe than sorry.

286
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:43,710
Yes. Got it.

287
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:46,129
We have a problem.

288
00:25:50,593 --> 00:25:53,678
I've always enjoyed your radio programme.

289
00:25:53,762 --> 00:25:58,808
And I never thought I'd see a miracle
with my very own eyes.

290
00:25:58,892 --> 00:26:00,810
That's right. Tucumcari.

291
00:26:00,894 --> 00:26:02,729
Right off 54.

292
00:26:02,812 --> 00:26:04,397
There's plenty of parking.

293
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:07,275
Well, thank you!

294
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:11,655
I'm a long-time listener
and a first-time caller.

295
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:16,993
Oh, I see it.

296
00:26:17,077 --> 00:26:18,828
Hello, there.

297
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:33,510
What's your name, honey?

298
00:26:51,152 --> 00:26:53,405
Goddamn it.

299
00:26:56,074 --> 00:26:58,118
The crowd's already thinning out.

300
00:26:58,201 --> 00:27:00,829
The image on the side of the house
has started to fade.

301
00:27:00,912 --> 00:27:04,541
Tomorrow, we're bringing in additional
security and blocking off parking.

302
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:07,627
Answer me this.

303
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:09,796
If they're saying it's radioactive
over there,

304
00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:12,299
how the hell is Acker still in that house?

305
00:27:12,382 --> 00:27:15,593
That was really more of an OSHA situation.

306
00:27:15,677 --> 00:27:17,679
The concern was for the construction crew.

307
00:27:17,762 --> 00:27:20,932
Turns out,
the radiation level was completely safe.

308
00:27:21,016 --> 00:27:23,935
We should be cleared
to resume construction on Thursday.

309
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:26,521
Assuming nothing else comes up.

310
00:27:30,942 --> 00:27:34,404
Kim, bottom-line me here.

311
00:27:35,572 --> 00:27:38,992
Clearly, this is all designed
to force us back to the table

312
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:41,703
and put us at a disadvantage
when we get there.

313
00:27:41,786 --> 00:27:44,831
We gotta get back in the driver's seat
on this thing.

314
00:27:45,832 --> 00:27:49,210
I say we sue them right back.
Sue Acker, sue Goodman.

315
00:27:49,294 --> 00:27:51,713
Take the fight back to them.

316
00:27:51,796 --> 00:27:54,632
Going down that road could take years.

317
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:59,095
They know this is costing Mesa Verde.
Time is on their side.

318
00:27:59,763 --> 00:28:01,681
You got that right.

319
00:28:04,267 --> 00:28:06,269
Rich, do you have anything to add?

320
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,270
Possibly.

321
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:12,984
What if there were a way
to turn this around on them?

322
00:28:14,277 --> 00:28:18,448
What if you don't build the call centre?
Or not at that location, at least.

323
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:21,993
Suddenly, you're holding all the cards,
there's nothing to delay.

324
00:28:22,077 --> 00:28:25,747
The other side's the one spending money
with no hope of recovering their expenses.

325
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:29,042
Wait, so...

326
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:31,127
What?

327
00:28:31,211 --> 00:28:34,464
I understand
there's a viable alternative site.

328
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:38,134
You make the switch, and you've won.

329
00:28:39,344 --> 00:28:41,930
Wait, hold up.
Didn't we let the other site go?

330
00:28:42,013 --> 00:28:46,017
Lot 2375 is available,
and our permits still apply.

331
00:28:46,101 --> 00:28:49,521
We'd still hit our target for
getting the call centre up and running.

332
00:28:50,522 --> 00:28:53,316
We took the liberty
of running the numbers for you.

333
00:28:54,943 --> 00:28:57,695
The financial hit would be negligible.

334
00:29:12,377 --> 00:29:16,339
My dad did not raise me
to run from a fight.

335
00:29:16,423 --> 00:29:17,463
Kevin, we're not saying...

336
00:29:17,507 --> 00:29:22,345
I'm not gonna roll over and let some
low-life shyster bully me off my land.

337
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:23,930
No offence, Kim.

338
00:29:25,014 --> 00:29:29,102
He's got one lawyer.
I got a room full of the best there is.

339
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,313
Here's what we're gonna do.

340
00:29:32,397 --> 00:29:35,692
You're gonna figure out a way
to get them off my property.

341
00:29:35,775 --> 00:29:39,362
That call centre's not moving
one goddamn inch!

342
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:00,800
You gave it your best shot.

343
00:30:00,884 --> 00:30:03,678
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

344
00:30:03,761 --> 00:30:06,264
You went the distance for the old S.O.B.

345
00:30:06,347 --> 00:30:08,099
Above and beyond.

346
00:30:08,183 --> 00:30:12,020
- You should feel good about that.
- You think so.

347
00:30:13,313 --> 00:30:16,941
You gave Acker more than he deserved.

348
00:30:17,025 --> 00:30:20,778
And let's be real.

349
00:30:20,862 --> 00:30:23,740
Putting me on this, that was bad.

350
00:30:24,449 --> 00:30:27,452
I mean, if anyone found out...

351
00:30:27,535 --> 00:30:30,246
You risked a lot for this guy.

352
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:38,796
Look, this time next week,
Acker will be living somewhere else.

353
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,382
Is that really such a big deal?

354
00:30:41,466 --> 00:30:46,179
Plus, Mesa Verde,
that's your bread and butter.

355
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:50,016
You can only push them so far.

356
00:30:54,812 --> 00:30:57,732
There's always another play.

357
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:06,366
But the rational thing to do here
is close the deal.

358
00:31:06,449 --> 00:31:07,742
Get the guy a few bucks.

359
00:31:07,825 --> 00:31:12,372
Pop the champagne with the other winners
and smile like you mean it.

360
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:15,750
You want a beer? I'm gonna get one.

361
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,170
Or?

362
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:31,933
Jimmy?

363
00:31:33,685 --> 00:31:37,021
There's no reason on God's green earth
to take this further.

364
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:39,107
It's not worth it.

365
00:31:44,779 --> 00:31:46,239
Or?

366
00:31:48,866 --> 00:31:49,867
Or...

367
00:31:50,868 --> 00:31:52,954
we go after Kevin Wachtell.

368
00:31:53,997 --> 00:31:56,708
Gets nasty. Gets personal.

369
00:31:56,791 --> 00:31:58,918
Gets dangerous.

370
00:32:21,691 --> 00:32:22,900
Okay.

371
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,322
Okay.

372
00:33:06,235 --> 00:33:09,530
- Yeah?
- Hey, it's me.

373
00:33:09,614 --> 00:33:11,574
- Yes, it is.
- Great.

374
00:33:11,658 --> 00:33:16,412
Listen, I got something for you.
Hear me out, because this is a good thing.

375
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:20,792
I'm sorry, I'm getting
some kind of reverb or something.

376
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:24,087
Are you in a tunnel, or...?

377
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,170
Yes.

378
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:27,590
What's that?

379
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:31,010
Yes. I'm in a tunnel.

380
00:33:32,011 --> 00:33:32,929
Okay.

381
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:38,060
Anyway,
this is not like that other thing, okay?

382
00:33:38,142 --> 00:33:40,937
It's a straight
piece of oppo research.

383
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:44,023
This is a lawyer hiring a P.I.
What do you say?

384
00:33:45,066 --> 00:33:46,943
So you're back to being a lawyer?

385
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:49,112
Yeah. Yeah, totally legit. So...

386
00:33:49,195 --> 00:33:51,906
Did I mention it's a paying gig?

387
00:33:51,989 --> 00:33:55,326
- I'm not available.
- Say again?

388
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:56,953
No.

389
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:22,437
Señora.

390
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,741
Good. Good...

391
00:35:19,786 --> 00:35:21,370
Thank you.

392
00:35:41,015 --> 00:35:43,392
Oh, man.

393
00:35:56,739 --> 00:35:58,658
Take it easy.

394
00:35:58,741 --> 00:36:00,660
You don't need to be doing that.

395
00:36:00,743 --> 00:36:02,578
Don't be stubborn.

396
00:36:02,662 --> 00:36:07,875
It's okay. I'm fine. Thank you.

397
00:36:30,857 --> 00:36:33,025
You got this guy where?

398
00:36:33,109 --> 00:36:35,278
Same place as Huell.

399
00:36:35,361 --> 00:36:39,991
So it's like some kind
of underground Craigslist?

400
00:36:41,325 --> 00:36:44,829
It's just a guy who knows people.

401
00:36:44,912 --> 00:36:46,747
People of a certain type.

402
00:36:47,748 --> 00:36:51,878
- He's very discreet.
- Well, he'd have to be.

403
00:37:01,929 --> 00:37:03,431
Here goes.

404
00:37:03,514 --> 00:37:06,392
It'll be fine. Just watch.

405
00:37:23,326 --> 00:37:25,953
I thought I was going to a law office.

406
00:37:26,037 --> 00:37:28,664
Yeah. This is a law office.

407
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:32,710
Gotcha.

408
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,550
Giselle, this is Mr. X.

409
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:43,888
It's my work name.

410
00:37:48,725 --> 00:37:52,021
You know,
those things are full of parasites.

411
00:37:52,104 --> 00:37:55,775
Yeah. Duly noted.
The conference room is in back.

412
00:37:55,858 --> 00:37:57,652
Yeah.

413
00:37:57,735 --> 00:37:59,111
Yeah.

414
00:38:04,533 --> 00:38:08,412
- I did the full work-up as tasked.
- And?

415
00:38:08,496 --> 00:38:11,832
Snake eyes. Bupkes. Nada.
Guy is squeaky clean.

416
00:38:11,916 --> 00:38:15,795
That's impossible.
I mean, everybody's got something.

417
00:38:15,878 --> 00:38:19,966
Not this time. You got an Eagle Scout
with a six-figure income.

418
00:38:21,092 --> 00:38:23,010
Arrests?

419
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:26,263
DUI.

420
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:29,308
In college, homecoming weekend.

421
00:38:29,392 --> 00:38:32,395
Thirty-four years ago.
Is that what you're looking for?

422
00:38:32,478 --> 00:38:34,981
Girlfriends? Offshore accounts?

423
00:38:35,064 --> 00:38:36,524
No secret bank accounts.

424
00:38:36,607 --> 00:38:41,278
No extra phones, no lunchtime quickies,
no lady friend, no boy toy.

425
00:38:41,362 --> 00:38:44,991
The guy's dull. Like,
Saturday night in Salt Lake City dull.

426
00:38:45,074 --> 00:38:49,328
No offence, but your work
is sounding kind of superficial.

427
00:38:53,582 --> 00:38:55,042
Superficial?

428
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:58,671
Yeah.

429
00:38:58,754 --> 00:39:02,383
Yeah, not hardly. I went the distance.

430
00:39:02,466 --> 00:39:07,096
I did a self-guided tour of his domicile.
All seven bedrooms, four and a half baths.

431
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:10,975
Hold on. You're saying
you broke into his house?

432
00:39:11,058 --> 00:39:14,353
Giselle, this is probably one
of those tricks-of-the-trade things.

433
00:39:14,437 --> 00:39:17,481
Probably just focus on the what
and skip over the how.

434
00:39:17,565 --> 00:39:19,191
I'd like to know.

435
00:39:24,238 --> 00:39:29,243
He has a security system
with a touchy upstairs window sensor.

436
00:39:29,326 --> 00:39:32,163
I trip it a couple of times
with an Airsoft...

437
00:39:33,164 --> 00:39:34,206
A BB gun.

438
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:38,169
The alarm drives the housekeeper crazy.

439
00:39:38,252 --> 00:39:41,714
So I show up in coveralls, toolbox,
alarm company ID,

440
00:39:41,797 --> 00:39:45,342
and she is more than happy
to let me have the run of the place.

441
00:39:45,426 --> 00:39:48,804
Does that meet with your approval?

442
00:39:48,888 --> 00:39:51,265
All right, so you get in,
and you find what?

443
00:39:51,348 --> 00:39:52,391
Like I said. Nothing.

444
00:39:52,475 --> 00:39:54,852
No, there's no such thing as nothing.

445
00:39:54,935 --> 00:39:57,938
Okay? We want specifics.

446
00:39:58,022 --> 00:40:00,357
You want specifics? Okay, well.

447
00:40:00,441 --> 00:40:02,943
I got specifics.

448
00:40:07,948 --> 00:40:09,200
That's the home office.

449
00:40:09,283 --> 00:40:12,745
Now, I spent an extra four minutes
opening the floor safe.

450
00:40:12,828 --> 00:40:14,371
Nothing but life insurance policies,

451
00:40:14,455 --> 00:40:17,291
a couple of rings
and a commemorative half-dollar.

452
00:40:17,374 --> 00:40:20,294
The guy's old school. No computers.

453
00:40:20,377 --> 00:40:23,422
Motel art on the walls,
paperwork on his desk.

454
00:40:23,506 --> 00:40:25,216
What kind of paperwork?

455
00:40:31,931 --> 00:40:34,141
You knock yourself out.

456
00:40:34,225 --> 00:40:39,980
Now, I may not be a nail salon lawyer,
but I know legit when I see it.

457
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:44,902
So you gonna withdraw
the superficial now?

458
00:40:47,029 --> 00:40:49,740
You think you could get
into his downtown office?

459
00:40:50,741 --> 00:40:53,410
Sure. I could.

460
00:40:53,494 --> 00:40:55,371
But there's a better way.

461
00:40:55,454 --> 00:40:57,123
Yeah?

462
00:40:57,206 --> 00:41:01,460
Yeah. I get two more guys.

463
00:41:01,544 --> 00:41:04,046
Guys who know how to handle themselves.

464
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:08,384
Now, we roll up to the subject
in an unmarked van.

465
00:41:08,467 --> 00:41:12,763
We grab him, put him in a bag,
and we take him out to the desert.

466
00:41:12,847 --> 00:41:13,763
We're done here.

467
00:41:13,764 --> 00:41:17,144
End of the day, the banker's giving you
everything you're after, all right?

468
00:41:17,226 --> 00:41:18,811
- We're done.
- No, no, no.

469
00:41:18,894 --> 00:41:20,694
Look, you get keys to the kingdom,
guaranteed.

470
00:41:20,771 --> 00:41:23,190
Okay, Sgt. Slaughter,
back to the paintball field.

471
00:41:23,274 --> 00:41:25,234
Okay. The grown-ups
need to talk. Let's go.

472
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:27,444
That's fine.
I'm just providing options for you.

473
00:41:27,528 --> 00:41:30,072
All right. This is the way out.
Exit through the gift shop.

474
00:41:30,156 --> 00:41:31,907
- All right.
- Don't touch anything, please.

475
00:41:31,991 --> 00:41:35,494
- I will not. Let me say on this...
- I know you're...

476
00:41:51,302 --> 00:41:55,347
I don't know what to say. I'm gonna
complain to management about that clown.

477
00:41:55,431 --> 00:41:57,725
My usual guy is very reliable.

478
00:42:00,853 --> 00:42:02,980
What? What is it?

479
00:42:25,336 --> 00:42:26,670
Got a minute?

480
00:42:26,754 --> 00:42:28,214
Sure.

481
00:42:30,382 --> 00:42:31,675
How's everything?

482
00:42:32,676 --> 00:42:37,514
All good. Kind of crunched, still
dealing with the Tucumcari situation.

483
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:41,185
And the pro bono work?

484
00:42:43,062 --> 00:42:44,396
It's good.

485
00:42:46,273 --> 00:42:47,483
Is something up?

486
00:42:48,484 --> 00:42:50,069
Listen,

487
00:42:50,527 --> 00:42:53,530
I'm thinking
you could take a break from Mesa Verde.

488
00:42:55,282 --> 00:42:56,533
A break?

489
00:42:56,617 --> 00:42:59,954
A pair of mineral rights beefs
just came in,

490
00:43:00,037 --> 00:43:01,580
they have your name on them.

491
00:43:01,664 --> 00:43:04,375
You can split your time between that
and your pro bono clients.

492
00:43:05,584 --> 00:43:08,796
- Mesa Verde is my client.
- And they still will be.

493
00:43:08,879 --> 00:43:11,799
I'll just step in and take point,
just on a temporary basis.

494
00:43:11,882 --> 00:43:13,926
And, of course, this goes without saying,

495
00:43:14,009 --> 00:43:16,136
this won't affect
any of your compensation,

496
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:17,846
and that includes your bonus.

497
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:22,268
You know, Mesa Verde is fully informed
of any potential conflicts.

498
00:43:22,351 --> 00:43:24,186
Kevin signed off himself.

499
00:43:25,187 --> 00:43:28,899
Still, I think you're going to need
to take a break.

500
00:43:32,736 --> 00:43:34,697
I don't understand
where this is coming from.

501
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:36,115
Don't you?

502
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:44,331
Kim.
Sometimes the less said, the better.

503
00:43:44,415 --> 00:43:47,167
- And why is that?
- Do we have to?

504
00:43:48,711 --> 00:43:50,337
Yes, we do.

505
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,216
All right.

506
00:43:55,551 --> 00:44:00,472
First, I had to twist your arm to get you
down to Tucumcari for the eviction.

507
00:44:00,556 --> 00:44:03,976
Then you put the full-court press on Kevin
to change sites.

508
00:44:04,059 --> 00:44:08,230
That doesn't work, and abracadabra,
your boyfriend's opposing counsel.

509
00:44:09,356 --> 00:44:12,693
I told you, I explained the situation
to Kevin and Paige.

510
00:44:12,776 --> 00:44:14,361
Yeah. I know you did.

511
00:44:15,362 --> 00:44:19,074
And I'm sorry to say,
I'm just not buying it.

512
00:44:33,088 --> 00:44:36,675
Rich? Rich. Hold on.

513
00:44:37,051 --> 00:44:39,928
What are you saying exactly?

514
00:44:41,096 --> 00:44:44,641
- Let's talk in my office.
- You are accusing me of something.

515
00:44:45,017 --> 00:44:46,477
Go ahead and say it.

516
00:44:47,478 --> 00:44:51,065
Are you talking about malfeasance?
Working against my client's interest?

517
00:44:51,148 --> 00:44:53,108
- Please.
- Rich, tell me.

518
00:44:53,192 --> 00:44:55,944
You know I worked my ass off to get here.
You know that.

519
00:44:56,028 --> 00:44:58,280
- Yes, I do know.
- So tell me.

520
00:44:58,364 --> 00:45:02,868
Please tell me why I would risk everything
for some squatter.

521
00:45:03,786 --> 00:45:07,915
Why? I don't understand. Are you trying
to protect the firm? From what?

522
00:45:07,998 --> 00:45:11,460
Kim, I am not trying to protect the firm,
I am trying to protect you.

523
00:45:11,543 --> 00:45:14,922
I don't need your protection.
I need to represent my client.

524
00:45:17,007 --> 00:45:18,801
If that's how you want it.

525
00:46:39,214 --> 00:46:41,550
So, what do you want from me?

526
00:46:42,885 --> 00:46:47,306
I think it best that Señora Cortazar
doesn't know about our association.

527
00:46:48,557 --> 00:46:52,895
I like to keep my business
as far from here as possible.

528
00:46:57,399 --> 00:46:59,067
You look much better.

529
00:47:00,068 --> 00:47:01,445
I am glad.

530
00:47:03,739 --> 00:47:09,745
So I'm here to see what a big heart
you have, is that the idea?

531
00:47:09,828 --> 00:47:12,831
You throw money at these people,
they bow low.

532
00:47:13,582 --> 00:47:18,170
As far as the people here are concerned,
I am the doctor's friend. Nothing more.

533
00:47:18,253 --> 00:47:21,298
They have no idea you financed
the whole place.

534
00:47:21,381 --> 00:47:23,133
I prefer it that way.

535
00:47:23,217 --> 00:47:25,719
The anonymous benefactor.

536
00:47:27,137 --> 00:47:29,765
Well, that must make you feel pretty good.

537
00:47:31,475 --> 00:47:35,062
And is that supposed
to balance the scales?

538
00:47:35,145 --> 00:47:38,065
Make up for everything else you do?

539
00:47:38,148 --> 00:47:40,484
It makes up for nothing.

540
00:47:42,027 --> 00:47:44,655
I am what I am.

541
00:47:47,824 --> 00:47:50,077
What is this place?

542
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,996
Call it a memorial.

543
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,665
To what?

544
00:48:00,921 --> 00:48:03,465
I already told you
what you can do with your money.

545
00:48:03,549 --> 00:48:08,929
You seem like a guy who can take a hint,
so what are we doing?

546
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:13,600
It seems to me that
you are at a crossroads.

547
00:48:13,684 --> 00:48:15,727
You can continue as you are.

548
00:48:17,563 --> 00:48:21,984
Drinking.
Estranged from your family.

549
00:48:22,067 --> 00:48:23,860
Brawling with street hoods.

550
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:27,364
We both know how that ends.

551
00:48:28,907 --> 00:48:31,702
- Yeah?
- You have another choice.

552
00:48:33,203 --> 00:48:35,622
Work for you as a button man.

553
00:48:36,999 --> 00:48:41,628
I'm in a war. I need a soldier.

554
00:48:43,422 --> 00:48:47,593
I'm gonna work for one drug dealer,
killing other drug dealers?

555
00:48:47,676 --> 00:48:49,469
That's your idea of a choice.

556
00:48:50,637 --> 00:48:53,890
You know better. You have met them.

557
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:57,227
You know what they are.

558
00:48:57,311 --> 00:48:59,396
Meaning the Salamancas.

559
00:49:00,772 --> 00:49:03,442
And you are so very different from them?

560
00:49:04,443 --> 00:49:06,236
Yes.

561
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,530
I am different.

562
00:49:14,828 --> 00:49:16,288
Why me?

563
00:49:17,372 --> 00:49:20,542
Because I believe that you understand.

564
00:49:20,626 --> 00:49:22,628
Understand what?

565
00:49:24,463 --> 00:49:26,173
Revenge.
