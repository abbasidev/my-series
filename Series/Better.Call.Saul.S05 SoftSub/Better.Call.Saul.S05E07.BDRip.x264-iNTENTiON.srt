1
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,597
And anything that already happened,
we're not going back over all that.

2
00:00:12,681 --> 00:00:15,725
Let's just focus on from here on out.

3
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:17,560
Right. Past is past.

4
00:00:17,644 --> 00:00:19,729
And moving forward...

5
00:00:19,813 --> 00:00:22,148
If I have the urge
to not tell you something,

6
00:00:22,232 --> 00:00:23,483
then I've gotta tell you.

7
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:25,318
Right. Full disclosure.

8
00:00:25,402 --> 00:00:26,778
And it works both ways.

9
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:28,238
Works both ways.

10
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,078
And mute.

11
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:40,166
Okay, what if I have the urge
to not tell you something, but I tell you,

12
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,502
and you don't like what you hear?

13
00:00:43,503 --> 00:00:45,714
I just wanna know what's going on.

14
00:00:47,048 --> 00:00:48,425
- Yeah, but...
- Jimmy.

15
00:00:49,426 --> 00:00:51,511
We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

16
00:00:58,101 --> 00:00:59,101
There he is.

17
00:01:02,689 --> 00:01:05,692
So we're really doing this, huh?

18
00:01:05,775 --> 00:01:07,485
Yeah, it looks that way.

19
00:01:10,029 --> 00:01:11,364
- Am I late?
- Nope.

20
00:01:11,448 --> 00:01:13,241
Cool. Good morning.

21
00:01:13,324 --> 00:01:15,160
- Thanks for coming.
- Good to see you.

22
00:01:15,243 --> 00:01:16,828
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

23
00:01:39,642 --> 00:01:41,102
What's up?

24
00:01:41,186 --> 00:01:43,229
Want me to hold the rings for you?

25
00:01:43,313 --> 00:01:45,607
Oh, there's no rings.

26
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,568
Well, I can fix that easy.
I seen a clerk downstairs,

27
00:01:48,651 --> 00:01:50,320
had a nice rock.

28
00:01:50,403 --> 00:01:51,946
Probably about a half a carat.

29
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,573
Huell, no, I...

30
00:01:54,574 --> 00:01:56,367
This is a different kind of thing.

31
00:01:58,161 --> 00:02:00,705
Oh, it's like that.

32
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:03,958
Then we should do it up right then,
for the rugrat.

33
00:02:04,042 --> 00:02:06,252
No, there's no rugrat.

34
00:02:08,254 --> 00:02:10,507
Well, you at least gonna
take her somewhere after this?

35
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,342
Little honeymoon?

36
00:02:12,425 --> 00:02:17,430
I got a friend who runs a B&B in Roswell,
get you a good deal.

37
00:02:17,514 --> 00:02:22,060
How about we take a raincheck on that?
We just need to get this done. Feel me?

38
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:26,314
This is a legal arrangement.

39
00:02:26,397 --> 00:02:30,944
This way, if I get into trouble,
they can't make her testify against me.

40
00:02:32,195 --> 00:02:33,947
You getting hitched for that?

41
00:02:34,948 --> 00:02:36,074
Yeah.

42
00:02:37,075 --> 00:02:41,496
Yeah. That's all this is. You got it?

43
00:02:42,664 --> 00:02:45,792
Is she gonna be a McGill or Goodman?

44
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:49,212
Wexler. I... I gotta go finish this.

45
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,131
Here you go.

46
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,176
Thanks.

47
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,721
Sir, do you have documentation
of your two previous dissolutions?

48
00:02:58,805 --> 00:02:59,973
Yeah.

49
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,106
Great. One sec.

50
00:03:23,371 --> 00:03:24,706
This okay with you?

51
00:03:26,082 --> 00:03:27,250
Of course.

52
00:03:28,251 --> 00:03:31,337
Yeah. I just mean...

53
00:03:32,589 --> 00:03:36,134
this might not be what you dreamed of
when you were 12.

54
00:03:37,677 --> 00:03:41,848
Jimmy, it's not about that.
This is just, you know...

55
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:44,726
everything we talked about.

56
00:03:44,809 --> 00:03:46,394
Right. Right. I know.

57
00:03:47,395 --> 00:03:49,063
Just making sure.

58
00:03:50,607 --> 00:03:53,484
All set. I just need 25 dollars.

59
00:03:53,568 --> 00:03:54,986
I got it.

60
00:04:29,437 --> 00:04:31,397
Sorry to keep you waiting.

61
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:33,483
Been that kind of day.

62
00:04:35,485 --> 00:04:37,111
So...

63
00:04:38,363 --> 00:04:39,864
Wexler-McGill?

64
00:04:41,074 --> 00:04:42,450
Yes.

65
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:45,370
- You picked the short vows, that right?
- Yes.

66
00:04:46,371 --> 00:04:48,748
And you have your witnesses.

67
00:04:50,917 --> 00:04:52,669
Okay, then.

68
00:04:52,752 --> 00:04:54,295
Here we go.

69
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:59,425
Here we go.

70
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:08,184
Do you, James Morgan McGill,
take Kimberly Wexler...

71
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,562
No middle name.

72
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:17,151
To be your lawfully wedded wife,
to have and to hold,

73
00:05:17,235 --> 00:05:19,112
from this day forward,

74
00:05:19,195 --> 00:05:21,155
for better, for worse,

75
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:23,366
for richer, for poorer,

76
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:27,537
in sickness and in health,
till death do you part?

77
00:05:30,373 --> 00:05:31,666
I do.

78
00:05:32,834 --> 00:05:34,919
And do you, Kimberly Wexler,

79
00:05:35,003 --> 00:05:36,879
take James Morgan McGill

80
00:05:36,963 --> 00:05:39,507
to be your lawfully wedded husband,

81
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,927
to have and to hold,
from this day forward,

82
00:05:43,011 --> 00:05:44,679
for better, for worse,

83
00:05:44,762 --> 00:05:47,056
for richer, for poorer,

84
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,058
in sickness and in health,

85
00:05:49,142 --> 00:05:51,394
till death do you part?

86
00:05:55,148 --> 00:05:57,567
I do.

87
00:05:59,027 --> 00:06:00,653
Do you have the rings?

88
00:06:00,737 --> 00:06:02,989
- We...
- We didn't do that.

89
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,742
No rings.

90
00:06:05,825 --> 00:06:06,909
Okey-dokey.

91
00:06:08,286 --> 00:06:11,122
Then by the power vested in me
by the state of New Mexico,

92
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:14,751
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

93
00:06:18,546 --> 00:06:20,298
You may kiss.

94
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,474
One more. One more.

95
00:06:53,873 --> 00:06:56,084
So lunch is definitely out?

96
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:58,252
Sorry, I just can't get away.

97
00:07:03,508 --> 00:07:06,010
But I'll be home early tonight.

98
00:07:06,094 --> 00:07:07,345
Me too.

99
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:18,731
Saul Goodman, speedy justice for you.

100
00:07:18,815 --> 00:07:20,191
I've been calling you.

101
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:22,235
Yeah, I had a busy morning.

102
00:07:22,318 --> 00:07:24,987
Go to lockup.
Your client's waiting for you.

103
00:07:25,071 --> 00:07:26,364
My client? What...?

104
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:28,282
Who got picked up this time?

105
00:07:28,366 --> 00:07:30,576
Jorge De Guzman.

106
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,163
Who the hell is Jorge De Guzman?

107
00:07:34,247 --> 00:07:35,665
Who do you think?

108
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:06,571
State v. Jorge De Guzman,

109
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:10,992
case CR2004003022.

110
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:13,828
Mr. De Guzman.

111
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:17,540
Murder in the first degree,

112
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:20,835
robbery while armed with a deadly weapon,

113
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:23,296
tampering with evidence, arson...

114
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:27,967
Your Honour, my client waives
the reading of the remaining charges.

115
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,510
How does he plead?

116
00:08:29,594 --> 00:08:32,138
Not guilty. On all charges.

117
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:36,767
I'd like to schedule a pre-trial hearing
in six weeks.

118
00:08:36,851 --> 00:08:38,769
And I'm going to deny bond.

119
00:08:38,853 --> 00:08:40,771
- Your Honour...
- That's my decision.

120
00:08:51,032 --> 00:08:53,951
Thank you for making time for us
on such short notice.

121
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:59,582
We wanted to tell you, face-to-face,

122
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:03,753
how much everyone in the firm regrets
what happened yesterday.

123
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:07,173
The situation in Tucumcari spiralled
out of control,

124
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:09,175
and we take full responsibility.

125
00:09:12,053 --> 00:09:14,597
Kevin, you chose me as your attorney,

126
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,643
and that was the best day
of my professional life.

127
00:09:20,228 --> 00:09:22,688
Yesterday was the worst day
of my professional life.

128
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:28,027
I can't tell you how much I regret
that I let you down.

129
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,862
But I want you to know

130
00:09:29,946 --> 00:09:33,449
that if you choose
to move forward with me, and with us...

131
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,786
nothing like that will ever happen again.

132
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:41,874
No one's denying that things
went off course,

133
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:44,877
but let's keep in mind
that over the last 18 months,

134
00:09:44,961 --> 00:09:46,796
we've opened 24 new branches.

135
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:51,133
And until Tucumcari,
the legal work has been...

136
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:53,511
flawless.

137
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:56,681
Well...

138
00:09:58,266 --> 00:10:00,518
Kim, you dropped the ball,
that's for sure.

139
00:10:01,644 --> 00:10:04,855
And, heh, with all your smarts,

140
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:07,942
whole office full of associates
and fancy degrees...

141
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:12,238
you get rolled over by...

142
00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:16,242
Well, you know what happened.

143
00:10:18,953 --> 00:10:20,955
I expected more.

144
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:33,259
Thanks for coming in.

145
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:38,556
Thank you, Kevin.

146
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,474
- Paige.
- Thank you.

147
00:10:40,558 --> 00:10:43,227
Kim, one more thing.

148
00:10:43,311 --> 00:10:47,857
This fellow, McGill,
or Goodman, whatever...

149
00:10:50,318 --> 00:10:52,320
You could do a whole lot better.

150
00:11:03,873 --> 00:11:07,043
I'll say fifty-fifty.
But we gave it a shot.

151
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:11,672
- Rich, we can't leave it like this.
- Oh, he'll stew for a bit.

152
00:11:11,756 --> 00:11:14,633
- And then we'll see.
- And if he does stick with us?

153
00:11:14,717 --> 00:11:17,636
Then what?
We walk on eggshells forever?

154
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,513
What's our alternative?

155
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:31,251
- We counted at seven, right?
- Yes, but after the survey...

156
00:11:33,069 --> 00:11:36,739
Sorry to interrupt, but do you mind if
we take just another minute of your time?

157
00:11:39,367 --> 00:11:40,534
I guess.

158
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:48,876
Kevin, no matter what our relationship
looks like moving forward,

159
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:51,337
we owe you the truth.

160
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:55,966
And the truth is,

161
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,344
you ignored our advice.

162
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:03,349
Oh, so this is my fault?

163
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:06,977
We said Mesa Verde should reconsider
the site for the call centre.

164
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:09,146
You declined.

165
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:12,858
We advised you to keep the purchase lot
as an investment.

166
00:12:12,942 --> 00:12:14,235
You declined.

167
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:17,238
And we advised you to leave that meeting
when it became apparent

168
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:19,615
that the other side was negotiating
in bad faith.

169
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:21,117
You declined.

170
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,495
At every point,
we gave you the best guidance we could,

171
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:27,456
and at every point,
you chose to go your own way.

172
00:12:28,624 --> 00:12:32,378
We are your attorneys,
and it is our job to advise you.

173
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:35,005
The decisions will always be yours,

174
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:38,050
but if you continue to ignore us...

175
00:12:39,802 --> 00:12:42,221
then this is the wrong relationship.

176
00:12:46,434 --> 00:12:49,728
And, Kevin, I have to tell you,

177
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:52,481
whoever represents you in the future...

178
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:56,777
I hope you're gonna listen to them
a little bit better.

179
00:12:59,405 --> 00:13:00,573
That it?

180
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:08,289
All right, then.

181
00:13:08,372 --> 00:13:10,040
See you on Thursday.

182
00:13:12,877 --> 00:13:14,336
Okay.

183
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:21,051
Well...

184
00:13:21,135 --> 00:13:22,553
I guess we'll get out of your hair.

185
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:24,847
Thursday.

186
00:13:37,193 --> 00:13:40,279
JMM. What's that?

187
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:45,326
- Oh, that's my motto.
- Yeah?

188
00:13:46,494 --> 00:13:49,038
Justice Matters Most.

189
00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:56,795
Okay, brass tacks...
How solid is this De Guzman thing?

190
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:59,191
Because if they find out
you're not who they think you are,

191
00:13:59,215 --> 00:14:01,359
- that could be a little...
- It's not gonna be a problem.

192
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:02,760
Great.

193
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:06,931
First up, we gotta get the murder rap
down to manslaughter.

194
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:11,101
Now I think that the DA's primed
to cut a deal,

195
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:14,271
so I say, make them come to us,
power move...

196
00:14:14,355 --> 00:14:16,023
- No.
- No?

197
00:14:17,483 --> 00:14:20,110
Nope. No deal.

198
00:14:21,237 --> 00:14:23,948
- Here's the thing about going to trial...
- No, no, no.

199
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:26,742
No trial. No deal.

200
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:30,329
Okay, yeah, sure, it's just...

201
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:33,082
Well, what did you have in mind?

202
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:36,085
- You're gonna get me out on bail.
- Bail?

203
00:14:36,168 --> 00:14:37,628
That's...

204
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:40,004
Well, the thing there...

205
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:42,275
I mean, I don't know how things work
south of the border,

206
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:45,386
but here, under these circumstances,

207
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:47,179
well, that's a long shot.

208
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:53,060
I'm sorry, I don't...

209
00:14:58,148 --> 00:15:00,484
You wanna be a friend of the cartel?

210
00:15:03,571 --> 00:15:05,364
Time to get yourself a new motto.

211
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:07,950
Just.

212
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:09,451
Make.

213
00:15:09,535 --> 00:15:10,536
Money.

214
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:22,673
But what does that mean, ephemeral,
repeated the Little Prince,

215
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:27,344
who never in his life let go of a question
once he had asked it.

216
00:15:27,428 --> 00:15:28,679
It means,

217
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:33,058
which is in danger
of speedy disappearance.

218
00:15:33,142 --> 00:15:37,187
Is my flower in danger
of speedy disappearance?

219
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:39,898
It certainly is.

220
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,614
Okay, kid, we'll finish the rest later.

221
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:48,407
Now, good night.

222
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,534
Not yet, Pop-Pop.

223
00:15:50,618 --> 00:15:52,703
Just two more pages?

224
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:56,165
Two more pages, that's it.

225
00:15:56,248 --> 00:15:57,958
All right, now lie down.

226
00:16:03,172 --> 00:16:07,301
My flower is ephemeral,
the Little Prince said to himself,

227
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:12,181
and she only has four thorns
to defend herself against the world...

228
00:16:20,731 --> 00:16:21,940
She's out.

229
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:25,653
I think The Little Prince
did the trick.

230
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:28,405
I think you wore her out
with all that hide-and-seek.

231
00:16:28,489 --> 00:16:31,784
I don't know,
I think maybe she wore me out.

232
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:37,247
This girl at work,

233
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:39,708
she can't get her son to sleep.

234
00:16:39,792 --> 00:16:43,754
The kid's 2 years old and he's still
tearing around the house at midnight.

235
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,425
Matty was like that.

236
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,510
Really?

237
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:51,762
Yeah. Really.

238
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:55,015
Never wanted to conk out.

239
00:16:55,099 --> 00:16:56,809
Too busy.

240
00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:02,022
He was such a cutie.

241
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:07,027
I love those pictures of him
sitting on Santa's lap.

242
00:17:07,111 --> 00:17:09,988
Oh, that face.

243
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:12,116
Cried his eyes out.

244
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:13,450
Every year.

245
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:16,704
And every year, he'd wanna try it again.

246
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,670
I'm better now.

247
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:29,466
What changed?

248
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:34,972
Decided to play the cards I was dealt.

249
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:47,901
Just decided he'll see us
at the regular Thursday meeting.

250
00:17:47,985 --> 00:17:49,570
You spoke truth to power.

251
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:51,655
We'll see if he sticks to it.

252
00:17:51,739 --> 00:17:52,823
How'd your day go?

253
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:58,537
I got married.

254
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:06,253
Yeah.

255
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:08,046
What?

256
00:18:38,327 --> 00:18:39,369
What?

257
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:43,123
I'm having the urge
not to tell you something.

258
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:47,252
It's nothing.
I'll... I'll tell you later, okay?

259
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:50,589
Jimmy, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

260
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:52,800
What?

261
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:59,723
I have a new client. He's connected.

262
00:18:59,807 --> 00:19:04,019
I mean, he's a cartel guy. From Mexico.

263
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:05,102
Pretty high up.

264
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:09,775
Anyway, he's in for murder,
and he wants bail, which...

265
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:10,943
That's impossible.

266
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:12,319
I mean...

267
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,697
no way in hell this dude
is ever seeing sunshine,

268
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:21,036
but if I could, you know,
somehow find a way...

269
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:28,252
he said I'd be a friend of the cartel.

270
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:31,547
Friend of the cartel?

271
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,635
You know what that means?

272
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:39,263
It means money.

273
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:42,850
Ranch in Montana kind of money.

274
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:45,894
Like private jet kind of money.

275
00:19:45,978 --> 00:19:49,231
Press conferences, TV news, the works.

276
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:57,072
But do you want to be a friend
of the cartel?

277
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:00,492
No.

278
00:20:00,576 --> 00:20:01,994
No.

279
00:20:02,995 --> 00:20:04,663
Absolutely not, I...

280
00:20:05,706 --> 00:20:07,249
Anyway, it's a moot point.

281
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:09,918
Because the guy is the definition
of a flight risk.

282
00:20:10,002 --> 00:20:14,423
So, look, I'm gonna put up a fight, right?
Just for show.

283
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:19,303
There's no judge on earth
who's gonna grant him bail.

284
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:23,640
I just... I didn't wanna tell you.

285
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:27,144
So I thought I should tell you.

286
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:39,656
You know what?

287
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,949
What?

288
00:20:48,457 --> 00:20:50,208
I'm glad you did.

289
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:38,423
Hey.

290
00:21:38,507 --> 00:21:40,717
No, no, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.

291
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:43,011
So, what's happening with 6th Street?

292
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:47,766
And the take?

293
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:49,977
Okay.

294
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:54,064
So, what are you gonna do about it?
Are you gonna send in Ocho Loco?

295
00:21:56,358 --> 00:21:58,944
Even better. Nice.

296
00:21:59,945 --> 00:22:01,154
Listen.

297
00:22:02,406 --> 00:22:04,366
I got something for you to do.

298
00:22:22,384 --> 00:22:25,846
I'm not telling you shit
until we talk about my dad.

299
00:22:27,264 --> 00:22:30,809
What you tell me
and when you say it is not up to you.

300
00:22:30,892 --> 00:22:32,812
Listen, you said,
when Lalo's out of the picture,

301
00:22:32,894 --> 00:22:34,938
we'll talk about my father, right?

302
00:22:35,022 --> 00:22:36,565
Well, he's out of the picture.

303
00:22:39,568 --> 00:22:41,903
- Say your piece.
- I'm done.

304
00:22:43,697 --> 00:22:45,198
I want out.

305
00:22:45,282 --> 00:22:47,576
And you want me to square it with Fring.

306
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:50,412
Fring's not all of it, it's the cartel.

307
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:52,622
I disappear,
they're gonna go after my father.

308
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:54,124
He's gotta come with me.

309
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:57,711
But no matter what I say,
with him, it's the cops or nothing.

310
00:22:57,794 --> 00:23:00,172
The cops won't solve this.

311
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:06,344
You got a way?

312
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:14,019
What are you holding out?

313
00:23:21,026 --> 00:23:23,195
Lalo called me from inside.

314
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:25,197
He put me back in charge.

315
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:29,367
And?

316
00:23:31,912 --> 00:23:33,121
And...

317
00:23:34,664 --> 00:23:37,584
he wants me to burn down Pollos Hermanos.

318
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:44,466
Then he's not out of the picture, is he?

319
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:09,282
The Avocado Mania promotion,

320
00:24:09,366 --> 00:24:13,620
which we've been testing in select
franchises, has been a smashing success,

321
00:24:13,703 --> 00:24:16,331
contributing to an 18 percent increase
in foot traffic

322
00:24:16,414 --> 00:24:17,874
at participating locations

323
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:21,253
and a 12 percent bump
in customer satisfaction.

324
00:24:21,336 --> 00:24:22,963
We know a good thing when we see it.

325
00:24:23,046 --> 00:24:27,509
So we are planning
to fully roll out Avocado Mania in Q2.

326
00:24:27,592 --> 00:24:31,346
Additionally, our innovative
family fun remodel

327
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:34,599
improved the in-store
Whiskerstay's experience,

328
00:24:34,683 --> 00:24:38,436
resulting in increased repeat business
system-wide.

329
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,772
In fact, we are happy to share the news

330
00:24:40,856 --> 00:24:44,818
that the latest ACSI survey
now places Whiskerstay's

331
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:49,698
in the top 10 percent
of limited-service chains nationwide.

332
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:53,118
Very nice, Cleo.

333
00:24:53,201 --> 00:24:55,036
Very nice. Thank you.

334
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:00,709
And now, let's hear from Gustavo Fring
of Los Pollos Hermanos.

335
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:03,253
- Thank you, Herr Schuler.
- Bitte.

336
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:05,922
I am delighted to report
that the last quarter,

337
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:10,260
Los Pollos Hermanos revenues
have increased 8.3 percent.

338
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:14,472
Comparable restaurant sales
increased by 4.2 percent.

339
00:25:14,556 --> 00:25:20,395
Representing the eighth consecutive
quarter of comparable sales increases.

340
00:25:22,315 --> 00:25:26,569
In addition to our continued focus
on our core menu,

341
00:25:26,651 --> 00:25:31,865
we are very proud to introduce
a new offering

342
00:25:31,948 --> 00:25:34,159
that will extend our product line

343
00:25:34,242 --> 00:25:37,871
while celebrating
our traditional New Mexican culture.

344
00:25:37,954 --> 00:25:43,501
I invite you to taste
our delicious Spice Curls.

345
00:25:44,753 --> 00:25:48,632
The curly fry with the Southwestern kick.

346
00:25:59,851 --> 00:26:01,311
Here we are.

347
00:26:02,938 --> 00:26:05,815
The bathroom has heated floors.

348
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:09,986
You'll find the dial
just under the light switch.

349
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:12,155
There's a steam shower.

350
00:26:13,782 --> 00:26:15,492
And bidet.

351
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:19,746
This controls the drapes.

352
00:26:21,206 --> 00:26:22,999
Many of our guests have enjoyed the rodeo.

353
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:26,378
It's in town tomorrow, Reliance Stadium.
I highly recommend it.

354
00:26:26,461 --> 00:26:29,256
Oh, thank you.
I'm only staying the night.

355
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:30,632
Next time then.

356
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:33,051
Is there anything else, sir?

357
00:26:33,134 --> 00:26:35,220
No. No, no, that will be all.

358
00:26:36,221 --> 00:26:38,014
Thank you very much.

359
00:26:42,894 --> 00:26:45,188
- Thank you, Mr. Fring.
- My pleasure.

360
00:28:14,486 --> 00:28:17,614
Peter. Look who's here.

361
00:28:18,323 --> 00:28:20,492
Hello, my friend.

362
00:28:20,575 --> 00:28:21,993
Gustavo.

363
00:28:26,498 --> 00:28:29,709
Always good to see you, my friend.

364
00:28:29,793 --> 00:28:31,127
Oh, you look well.

365
00:28:31,211 --> 00:28:32,837
Well...

366
00:28:32,921 --> 00:28:34,547
I don't feel well.

367
00:28:38,051 --> 00:28:40,470
Maybe things will improve,
now that you're here.

368
00:28:41,471 --> 00:28:45,600
Lydia tells me Salamanca is in jail.
This means you can continue construction?

369
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:52,107
Eduardo Salamanca has been arrested
for murder.

370
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:57,112
However, even from jail, he creates...

371
00:28:58,154 --> 00:28:59,154
issues.

372
00:29:00,073 --> 00:29:01,991
What kind of issues?

373
00:29:03,326 --> 00:29:06,079
He ordered his men
to burn down one of my restaurants.

374
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:11,376
You're kidding. He's in jail.
He can still do that?

375
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:12,919
I'm afraid so.

376
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,631
I know it's not exactly
my area of expertise,

377
00:29:16,714 --> 00:29:19,801
but don't people get killed in prison
all the time?

378
00:29:19,884 --> 00:29:23,471
I mean, shanked and shivved, and whatnot.

379
00:29:23,555 --> 00:29:26,599
Anything happens to Salamanca
on this side of the border,

380
00:29:26,683 --> 00:29:29,936
the cartel will assume
that it was my doing.

381
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:33,022
It would mean war.

382
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:37,527
War for which we are unprepared.

383
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,112
My God.

384
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:42,782
- This nightmare never ends.
- He's concerned about the money.

385
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:48,204
Concerned?
Four million eight hundred thousand euros.

386
00:29:48,288 --> 00:29:50,373
It's a miracle I haven't been caught.

387
00:29:50,457 --> 00:29:53,626
Last year, the auditors came this close.

388
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:57,005
One of them, a woman, I think she knew.

389
00:29:57,088 --> 00:29:59,007
- Peter...
- At first it was a year.

390
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:01,301
Then it was two. Then three.

391
00:30:01,384 --> 00:30:04,053
And now you're telling me, how long?

392
00:30:04,137 --> 00:30:06,639
I can't. I can't.

393
00:30:06,723 --> 00:30:09,142
- They will catch me. And then it is over.
- Peter.

394
00:30:09,225 --> 00:30:10,602
- I can't.
- Peter.

395
00:30:10,685 --> 00:30:13,062
Gustavo, please. I can't.

396
00:30:13,146 --> 00:30:14,355
Listen to me.

397
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:16,274
Listen to me.

398
00:30:19,402 --> 00:30:21,196
Do you remember Santiago?

399
00:30:23,198 --> 00:30:27,118
The two of us. Our backs to the wall.

400
00:30:27,202 --> 00:30:31,039
I will never forget what you did.

401
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:35,919
- Oh, I...
- You are still the same man.

402
00:30:37,712 --> 00:30:41,424
You will do what is necessary.

403
00:30:46,721 --> 00:30:48,890
You stay strong, my friend.

404
00:30:50,058 --> 00:30:52,018
We have come so far.

405
00:30:53,061 --> 00:30:55,438
We are so very close.

406
00:31:02,946 --> 00:31:04,322
Okay.

407
00:31:05,949 --> 00:31:06,949
Good.

408
00:31:07,784 --> 00:31:10,620
Now, you eat.

409
00:31:19,921 --> 00:31:22,840
Tomorrow, you and I are
going to the rodeo.

410
00:31:22,924 --> 00:31:24,717
- The rodeo?
- Yeah.

411
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:26,386
To see the cowboys.

412
00:31:26,469 --> 00:31:28,471
I've never been to a rodeo.

413
00:31:28,555 --> 00:31:30,598
Well, you're going to love it.

414
00:31:31,766 --> 00:31:33,476
Gustavo?

415
00:31:36,354 --> 00:31:37,397
Prosit.

416
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,815
- Prosit.
- Prost.

417
00:31:42,193 --> 00:31:45,572
Your guest will relax
in the elegant great room,

418
00:31:45,655 --> 00:31:48,616
complete with soaring stone fireplace.

419
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:52,537
- Soaring stone?
- Yeah, that's the best kind of stone.

420
00:31:54,122 --> 00:31:56,749
How about a lavender farm?

421
00:31:56,833 --> 00:31:57,833
Seriously?

422
00:31:57,834 --> 00:32:00,878
Yeah, well, it's lavender-adjacent.

423
00:32:00,962 --> 00:32:02,130
Tell me more.

424
00:32:02,213 --> 00:32:04,215
Imagine a magical land called home.

425
00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:07,468
Watch the sunset
across your own private meadow

426
00:32:07,552 --> 00:32:10,471
as wildflowers sway in the breeze.

427
00:32:10,555 --> 00:32:15,435
This stunning desert retreat promotes
a casual yet luxurious lifestyle.

428
00:32:15,518 --> 00:32:17,312
I'm casual yet luxurious.

429
00:32:17,395 --> 00:32:19,772
Yeah. Totally.

430
00:32:19,856 --> 00:32:21,649
It's got a five-car garage.

431
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:23,651
What? How's that gonna work?

432
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:26,904
- We only get two-and-a-half cars each?
- Yeah. Garbage.

433
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:33,369
So that was wildflowers
dancing in the sun?

434
00:32:33,453 --> 00:32:36,331
They're swaying in the breeze.

435
00:32:36,414 --> 00:32:37,999
Okay. Well, either way.

436
00:32:38,082 --> 00:32:39,876
They're having a very nice time.

437
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,610
Saul Goodman, speedy justice for you.

438
00:33:05,693 --> 00:33:07,195
I need a word.

439
00:33:08,196 --> 00:33:12,200
A word? Yeah.
Yeah, I have a word for you.

440
00:33:12,283 --> 00:33:16,037
Tunnel.
Which is where I am right now.

441
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,915
Sorry, I can't hear you.
Maybe try again later?

442
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:21,375
Coming.

443
00:33:23,711 --> 00:33:27,340
Whatever it is, it's not for me.
And it should be for you.

444
00:33:28,716 --> 00:33:30,927
Hey, forget your key...?

445
00:33:34,722 --> 00:33:37,642
Okay, yeah, come right in.

446
00:33:37,725 --> 00:33:39,560
Make yourself at home.

447
00:33:40,853 --> 00:33:44,357
You got me in my underwear,
so enjoy the show.

448
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:51,364
You're representing Eduardo Salamanca,
aka Jorge De Guzman?

449
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:55,618
Yeah, he's a client of mine.
Yeah. So?

450
00:33:55,702 --> 00:33:59,122
Well, I need you to get him out on bail.

451
00:34:00,373 --> 00:34:03,835
Wait, what do you have to do
with Lalo Salamanca?

452
00:34:03,918 --> 00:34:07,088
I represent someone who has an interest.

453
00:34:07,171 --> 00:34:08,840
Someone like who?

454
00:34:08,923 --> 00:34:12,135
Someone your client can never know about.

455
00:34:12,218 --> 00:34:16,055
Yeah, look, I don't take marching orders
from the man behind the curtain.

456
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:19,559
In this case, it's better that you do.

457
00:34:24,313 --> 00:34:26,482
You know what Salamanca did, right?

458
00:34:27,608 --> 00:34:29,485
I am aware.

459
00:34:32,947 --> 00:34:34,532
What's this?

460
00:34:34,615 --> 00:34:37,994
This is everything you need...

461
00:34:38,995 --> 00:34:40,955
to do your job.

462
00:36:47,832 --> 00:36:49,166
Go.

463
00:38:05,076 --> 00:38:09,580
Significant ties to his local community?
What ties?

464
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:13,918
Did you actually think I wasn't gonna hear
about this private eye of yours?

465
00:38:14,001 --> 00:38:16,170
- Excuse me?
- Dave Clark.

466
00:38:17,421 --> 00:38:22,051
Dave Clark. The mysterious third party
who's coaching your key witness.

467
00:38:23,844 --> 00:38:25,596
All right, good. You know what?

468
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,432
Do the dumb act for Parson. Please.

469
00:38:28,516 --> 00:38:31,894
I can't wait to see him rip you both
a new one.

470
00:38:35,648 --> 00:38:38,567
Any idea what that asshole
is going on about?

471
00:38:41,404 --> 00:38:43,322
I'll call the librarian.

472
00:38:57,712 --> 00:38:59,171
Hey.

473
00:38:59,255 --> 00:39:01,882
Play to the judge, okay?

474
00:39:01,966 --> 00:39:06,429
But don't... Don't play to the judge.
Don't overdo it.

475
00:39:06,512 --> 00:39:09,765
Try not to be too cool.
I mean, look humble.

476
00:39:11,517 --> 00:39:13,269
A little bit scared.

477
00:39:14,645 --> 00:39:16,188
No problem.

478
00:39:19,567 --> 00:39:22,069
- Is that them?
- Yep.

479
00:39:25,865 --> 00:39:27,158
Who's that?

480
00:39:31,495 --> 00:39:34,248
It's gotta be his family.

481
00:39:34,331 --> 00:39:36,542
Fred Whalen.

482
00:39:39,086 --> 00:39:42,840
The guy who died at the Travel Wire.

483
00:40:10,451 --> 00:40:12,369
Mr. Goodman?

484
00:40:14,872 --> 00:40:16,415
Mr. Goodman.

485
00:40:18,918 --> 00:40:23,089
That's right, Your Honour.
Witness tampering.

486
00:40:23,172 --> 00:40:24,381
I have reason to believe

487
00:40:24,465 --> 00:40:27,510
that the prosecution's key witness
was coached

488
00:40:27,593 --> 00:40:32,515
by a private investigator
who was hired to pervert justice.

489
00:40:33,766 --> 00:40:36,018
Does the prosecution have a response?

490
00:40:37,186 --> 00:40:38,854
Unfortunately, Your Honour,

491
00:40:38,938 --> 00:40:43,484
it seems a person unknown to my team
may have interacted with our witness,

492
00:40:43,567 --> 00:40:45,486
causing her to call Detective Roberts

493
00:40:45,569 --> 00:40:49,156
and amend her statement
two months after the initial interview.

494
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:54,870
This only recently came to our attention,
and we are vigorously investigating.

495
00:40:54,954 --> 00:40:56,956
I would hope so.

496
00:40:57,039 --> 00:40:58,499
Having said that, Your Honour,

497
00:40:58,582 --> 00:41:02,044
this witness is one small element
of the state's case.

498
00:41:02,128 --> 00:41:05,840
In light of the extraordinary violence
of the crime

499
00:41:05,923 --> 00:41:07,675
and the fact that Mr. De Guzman

500
00:41:07,758 --> 00:41:10,719
is a foreign national
with no ties to the community,

501
00:41:10,803 --> 00:41:13,806
we ask that the Court recognise him
as a flight risk

502
00:41:13,889 --> 00:41:16,475
and as a danger to the citizens
of New Mexico.

503
00:41:17,893 --> 00:41:19,395
Mr. Goodman?

504
00:41:21,272 --> 00:41:23,440
All due respect, Your Honour,

505
00:41:23,524 --> 00:41:28,237
but the witness is not just
one small element of the state's case,

506
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:32,783
she's the only witness tying Mr. De Guzman
to the murder scene.

507
00:41:32,867 --> 00:41:35,411
And she's been manipulated.

508
00:41:35,494 --> 00:41:39,290
Furthermore, the claim that Mr. De Guzman
has no ties to the community,

509
00:41:39,373 --> 00:41:41,500
that's just patently false.

510
00:41:41,584 --> 00:41:45,880
Mr. De Guzman has deep ties
to the city of Albuquerque.

511
00:41:45,963 --> 00:41:48,883
I'd like you to meet his family.

512
00:41:48,966 --> 00:41:53,304
That's his fiancée
and the love of his life, Beth McKinnon.

513
00:41:53,387 --> 00:41:56,265
His stepchildren, Christopher and Ella.

514
00:41:56,348 --> 00:41:59,977
And sitting with them
is Beth's mother, Mary.

515
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,813
Now, Your Honour,

516
00:42:02,897 --> 00:42:06,650
my client is the only father
that these kids have ever known.

517
00:42:06,734 --> 00:42:07,902
They depend on him.

518
00:42:07,985 --> 00:42:13,824
How can you possibly see fit
to separate this beautiful family?

519
00:42:16,535 --> 00:42:17,786
I'm sorry.

520
00:42:18,871 --> 00:42:23,375
The testimony implicating
Mr. De Guzman

521
00:42:23,459 --> 00:42:24,919
in this crime,

522
00:42:25,002 --> 00:42:26,545
it's been fabricated.

523
00:42:26,629 --> 00:42:29,048
You've already held him for three days.

524
00:42:29,131 --> 00:42:33,928
Given the circumstances,
Mr. De Guzman should be granted bond.

525
00:42:34,011 --> 00:42:36,138
Your Honour, a sidebar?

526
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:58,244
- Your Honour, I really...
- Sit.

527
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:08,796
I accept the defence's argument
that bond is warranted.

528
00:43:10,005 --> 00:43:13,509
But considering
the severity of the charges,

529
00:43:13,592 --> 00:43:16,303
I will set the amount at 7 million.

530
00:43:16,387 --> 00:43:18,180
- Cash only.
- Oh, Your Honour...

531
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:21,642
All rise.

532
00:43:26,272 --> 00:43:27,481
Seven million.

533
00:43:27,564 --> 00:43:29,441
Listen, I am so, so sorry.

534
00:43:29,525 --> 00:43:31,193
I can do that.

535
00:43:32,236 --> 00:43:33,404
The thing is...

536
00:43:34,571 --> 00:43:36,949
- I'm gonna need you to pick it up.
- What, me?

537
00:43:37,032 --> 00:43:39,702
I'll call you.

538
00:44:03,559 --> 00:44:04,601
Hey, Jimmy.

539
00:44:05,853 --> 00:44:06,979
Howard.

540
00:44:09,231 --> 00:44:12,568
So, have you thought
any more about the job?

541
00:44:13,569 --> 00:44:16,572
The job. Yeah.

542
00:44:16,655 --> 00:44:17,948
No...

543
00:44:19,158 --> 00:44:22,119
I'm still giving it some thought.

544
00:44:25,331 --> 00:44:26,498
Giving it some thought?

545
00:44:29,168 --> 00:44:30,252
Yeah.

546
00:44:32,796 --> 00:44:35,382
You know what? Don't bother.

547
00:44:36,383 --> 00:44:40,012
It seems I've upset you.
So offer's off the table.

548
00:44:41,055 --> 00:44:43,098
You upset me... How'd you upset me?

549
00:44:44,224 --> 00:44:45,392
You tell me.

550
00:44:50,439 --> 00:44:52,816
This is getting a little weird, Howard.

551
00:44:54,693 --> 00:44:56,403
You wanna know what's weird?

552
00:44:57,446 --> 00:44:59,198
It's weird to offer a job to a man,

553
00:44:59,281 --> 00:45:01,408
and in return,
have bowling balls thrown at your car.

554
00:45:02,534 --> 00:45:05,287
And prostitutes
sent to your business lunch.

555
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:07,998
That's weird.

556
00:45:09,166 --> 00:45:11,377
Are you listening to yourself?

557
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:15,297
I don't know what you're into
these days, Howard, but...

558
00:45:15,381 --> 00:45:18,717
prostitutes and bowling balls?

559
00:45:19,718 --> 00:45:21,804
You sound unhinged.

560
00:45:25,808 --> 00:45:27,851
Jimmy, I'm sorry you're in pain.

561
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:31,939
You're sorry.

562
00:45:32,022 --> 00:45:33,440
You're sorry?

563
00:45:34,525 --> 00:45:37,403
You kill my brother,
and you say you're sorry?

564
00:45:38,445 --> 00:45:42,032
Let me tell you something.
The job offer, it didn't upset me.

565
00:45:42,116 --> 00:45:44,034
It amused me.

566
00:45:44,118 --> 00:45:48,163
Ooh, big job at the illustrious HHM.

567
00:45:48,247 --> 00:45:50,874
A chance to play at the palace.
Little old me?

568
00:45:50,958 --> 00:45:53,794
- I was trying...
- You have no idea what's going on.

569
00:45:53,877 --> 00:45:57,881
You're a teensy, tiny man
in a teensy-weensy, little bubble.

570
00:45:57,965 --> 00:46:01,009
- Oh, Jimmy.
- Oh, don't you fucking oh Jimmy me.

571
00:46:01,093 --> 00:46:03,220
You look down on me? You pity me?

572
00:46:03,303 --> 00:46:04,930
Walk away. That's right, Howard.

573
00:46:05,013 --> 00:46:06,473
You know why I didn't take the job?

574
00:46:06,557 --> 00:46:08,517
Because it's too small!

575
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,477
I don't care about it!

576
00:46:10,561 --> 00:46:13,439
It's nothing to me! It's a bacterium!

577
00:46:13,522 --> 00:46:16,442
I travel in worlds you can't even imagine!

578
00:46:16,525 --> 00:46:19,069
You can't conceive of what I'm capable of!

579
00:46:19,153 --> 00:46:21,363
I'm so far beyond you!

580
00:46:21,447 --> 00:46:23,615
I'm like a god in human clothing!

581
00:46:23,699 --> 00:46:27,119
Lightning bolts shoot from my fingertips!
