1
00:01:00,562 --> 00:01:02,480
Hey, did you hear all that?

2
00:01:02,564 --> 00:01:05,775
I heard enough
to know she saved your ass.

3
00:01:05,859 --> 00:01:06,859
So...

4
00:01:08,194 --> 00:01:10,321
So, what happens next?

5
00:01:11,322 --> 00:01:12,574
We'll see.

6
00:01:18,872 --> 00:01:20,123
Who was that?

7
00:01:22,417 --> 00:01:25,295
That was...

8
00:01:27,046 --> 00:01:28,715
That's the guy who saved my life.

9
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:33,094
Kim, I got the money.
I was on my way back.

10
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:35,889
I thought I was home free.

11
00:01:37,974 --> 00:01:38,974
And I was...

12
00:01:39,809 --> 00:01:41,561
ambushed by...

13
00:01:42,562 --> 00:01:44,856
a gang.

14
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,275
A cartel gang.

15
00:01:48,485 --> 00:01:51,571
And they took the money,

16
00:01:51,654 --> 00:01:53,239
and one of them...

17
00:01:55,283 --> 00:01:57,410
put a gun to my head.

18
00:01:59,788 --> 00:02:03,166
Then that guy on the phone, he showed up.

19
00:02:03,249 --> 00:02:06,002
He shot them with a sniper rifle.

20
00:02:06,085 --> 00:02:09,964
He killed all of them.

21
00:02:11,341 --> 00:02:13,218
All but one.

22
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:15,011
One guy got away.

23
00:02:16,221 --> 00:02:20,517
And later,
I helped him to get that one too.

24
00:02:21,518 --> 00:02:22,476
Kim, I...

25
00:02:22,477 --> 00:02:24,187
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.

26
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,022
Oh, my God.

27
00:02:26,105 --> 00:02:27,315
Oh, my God.

28
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,823
I think we should get out of here.

29
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:47,877
Kind of assumed we'd be staying
at a Motel 6 or the nail salon.

30
00:02:47,961 --> 00:02:50,630
It's better to have more people around.

31
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:28,167
How are your shoulders?

32
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:33,214
Should I put something on them
or would that just make it worse?

33
00:03:34,424 --> 00:03:35,466
I think...

34
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:38,469
I'm...

35
00:03:42,807 --> 00:03:44,684
Am I bad for you?

36
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,523
Are you bad for me?

37
00:03:52,317 --> 00:03:54,319
I got you into this.

38
00:03:55,612 --> 00:03:57,280
What happened tonight.

39
00:03:58,364 --> 00:04:02,243
None of this would've happened
if you weren't with me.

40
00:04:24,057 --> 00:04:26,225
You crossed a line.

41
00:04:29,896 --> 00:04:31,814
You're not gonna do it again.

42
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:38,112
Yeah.

43
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,159
It's been a long day.

44
00:04:44,202 --> 00:04:46,537
Come on, make room.

45
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:05,640
Good night.

46
00:05:57,817 --> 00:05:58,735
Well?

47
00:05:58,736 --> 00:06:01,070
He went over the border and kept going.

48
00:06:01,154 --> 00:06:04,240
Looks to be headed for his place
in Chihuahua.

49
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:06,784
He should be there in a few hours.

50
00:06:06,868 --> 00:06:09,412
- Good.
- There's a wrinkle.

51
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:11,164
He took Varga with him.

52
00:06:12,248 --> 00:06:13,248
Why?

53
00:06:14,292 --> 00:06:17,795
If he thought Varga was working for you,
he would've killed him on the spot.

54
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:22,633
If I had to guess
I'd say Varga is up for a promotion.

55
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:25,720
Can you communicate with Varga?

56
00:06:25,803 --> 00:06:29,223
Salamanca's place
is in the middle of nowhere.

57
00:06:29,307 --> 00:06:31,642
Landlines and SAT phones only.

58
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:33,978
A technical issue.

59
00:06:35,146 --> 00:06:39,150
The way things stand,
he's gonna get caught in the crossfire.

60
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:42,653
I'm thinking we should find a way
to pull him out of there.

61
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:52,246
And tip our hand?

62
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,211
He's earned some consideration.

63
00:07:09,722 --> 00:07:12,600
Does Varga know
there's going to be an assassination?

64
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:15,937
No one's told him,
but he can make a pretty damn good guess.

65
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,397
Perhaps...

66
00:07:19,524 --> 00:07:21,567
there is a way to make use
of this situation.

67
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,029
The men I've chosen for this
are highly skilled.

68
00:07:25,113 --> 00:07:27,073
They're the best in their business.

69
00:07:27,156 --> 00:07:29,617
But the one thing they do not have...

70
00:07:30,785 --> 00:07:33,329
is a man on the inside.

71
00:08:03,359 --> 00:08:05,778
Someone's coming. SUV.

72
00:08:05,862 --> 00:08:07,738
Don't recognise it.

73
00:09:18,643 --> 00:09:21,062
Nachito, come on over, don't be shy.

74
00:09:24,732 --> 00:09:26,835
I'd like to introduce you all to Ignacio.

75
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:29,528
He's going to be staying with us a while.
He's a friend of mine.

76
00:09:29,612 --> 00:09:31,489
These, these are my people.

77
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:33,741
Yolanda, she is the best cook
in all of Chihuahua.

78
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:37,703
You're gonna eat like you have never eaten
before in your life.

79
00:09:37,787 --> 00:09:40,873
Cecilio, he takes care
of all of my gardens.

80
00:09:43,084 --> 00:09:45,962
His tomatoes are the best ever.

81
00:09:46,045 --> 00:09:51,550
Tito, Miguel, Herardo, Raul,
and all the rest of these fools.

82
00:09:51,634 --> 00:09:54,178
They're supposed
to be guarding this place,

83
00:09:54,262 --> 00:09:59,058
but I just keep them around
because they're so pretty, right?

84
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,188
And what about you?

85
00:10:05,523 --> 00:10:10,069
Am I going to have to carry
my own things or what?

86
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:11,070
Sorry...

87
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,407
Get going, asshole!

88
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:18,202
Hey, listen. Welcome.

89
00:10:18,286 --> 00:10:20,538
Smile. You're in my house, man.
Come on. Come in.

90
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:54,322
Hey, did you pack anything
with aloe in it?

91
00:10:54,405 --> 00:10:56,407
Oh, morning.

92
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,034
Morning.

93
00:10:58,117 --> 00:10:59,869
I didn't wake you, did I?

94
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,538
No, you're going to court?

95
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:04,665
Yeah, I have a hearing at 10:00.

96
00:11:04,749 --> 00:11:07,710
And I wanna see if I can catch Oakley
before I go in.

97
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,048
You seemed like you could use the sleep.

98
00:11:12,131 --> 00:11:13,924
Yeah.

99
00:11:25,353 --> 00:11:27,480
Hey, I think I might have a better idea.

100
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:29,482
What if we spend the whole day here,
you know?

101
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:30,900
This place has got everything.

102
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:34,362
It's got a heated pool,
a swim-up bar, a hot tub.

103
00:11:34,445 --> 00:11:36,280
Well, I didn't pack a swimsuit.

104
00:11:36,364 --> 00:11:40,618
Neither did I, there's a shop downstairs
and we could stop in at the spa.

105
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:42,828
You know? And get couple's massages.

106
00:11:42,912 --> 00:11:44,288
With your sunburn?

107
00:11:44,372 --> 00:11:45,372
Yeah.

108
00:11:46,457 --> 00:11:48,793
Or a seaweed wrap, you know?

109
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:52,505
And then we'll just go hang
in the co-ed sauna, you know?

110
00:11:52,588 --> 00:11:55,049
Sweat out some toxins and...

111
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:58,469
Oh, 24-hour room service.

112
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:01,639
Hey, what could be more luxurious
than to spend a whole day

113
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:03,808
being totally pampered

114
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:06,185
and end it all
with a midnight cheeseburger?

115
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:08,604
Come on, hey, don't we deserve this?

116
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:11,190
Jimmy, I have clients.

117
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:12,566
Yeah.

118
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:16,028
You just quit Schweikart.
I mean, take one day off.

119
00:12:16,112 --> 00:12:18,989
The clerks love you. They will give you
continuance on anything.

120
00:12:19,073 --> 00:12:21,367
Hey, Kim.
We already sprang for this place.

121
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,452
I'm just saying, let's take advantage.

122
00:12:23,536 --> 00:12:26,038
You know, let's John and Yoko this sucker.

123
00:12:26,122 --> 00:12:27,998
You don't think it's safe.

124
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,795
Probably it is, but...

125
00:12:34,046 --> 00:12:39,885
Here's the thing. Lalo has guys, right?
So it doesn't really matter where he is.

126
00:12:39,969 --> 00:12:44,056
If he finds one loose end,
all it takes is a phone call.

127
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:47,893
Do you know something
you're not telling me?

128
00:12:47,977 --> 00:12:53,858
No. No, I don't. But what's the harm
in being a little cautious?

129
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:55,818
What about tomorrow?

130
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:57,945
Or the next day?

131
00:12:58,028 --> 00:13:00,406
Jimmy, what about next week?

132
00:13:01,407 --> 00:13:02,867
I don't know.

133
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:07,495
All right.

134
00:13:08,998 --> 00:13:10,708
Then the way I see it,

135
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:14,336
we just need to keep our eyes open
and get on with our lives.

136
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:16,629
Kim, listen...

137
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:20,426
The courthouse...
It's three blocks from here.

138
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:26,223
It's full of cops,
police headquarters is right next door.

139
00:13:26,307 --> 00:13:27,766
Jimmy...

140
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:32,980
it's gonna be fine.

141
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:34,732
I'll see you later.

142
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:05,137
Hey, it's me. I want an update.

143
00:14:06,305 --> 00:14:09,642
Bullshit.
I wanna know what's going on.

144
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:13,020
Not good enough. No.

145
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:17,733
You know what? You...
We are gonna talk about this face to face.

146
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:20,694
You tell me where you are,
I will come to you...

147
00:14:20,778 --> 00:14:22,154
Hello?

148
00:14:31,497 --> 00:14:36,377
That means we won.
The state dropped the charges.

149
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,629
No, no, no. You don't have
to appear in court again.

150
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:41,757
Now we both have the morning off.

151
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:52,560
I'm sorry, Mary, you know what?
I have to go.

152
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:56,480
But call if you have any questions,
anytime. Okay.

153
00:14:56,564 --> 00:14:57,480
Yes, bye.

154
00:14:57,481 --> 00:14:59,900
Hey, Grant? You got a minute?

155
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:01,944
How's it going?

156
00:15:01,945 --> 00:15:02,861
Let's see.

157
00:15:02,862 --> 00:15:06,950
I have half an hour to plead out
four taggers and a homeless guy

158
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:09,159
who tried to stuff
a dozen hard-boiled eggs

159
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:10,953
down his pants at a Ruby Tuesday's.

160
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:13,390
Life in the public defender's office.
How's your day so far?

161
00:15:13,414 --> 00:15:16,250
I got some holes in my schedule
I'm looking to fill.

162
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,501
Holes?

163
00:15:17,585 --> 00:15:19,587
You're telling me you're billing,
what, 250 an hour

164
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,338
and you got holes in your schedule?

165
00:15:21,422 --> 00:15:23,799
If I were you, I'd keep things airtight.

166
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:26,468
I'd like some more PD overflow.

167
00:15:26,552 --> 00:15:30,514
Go talk to the contract liaison,
and Gloria will set you up.

168
00:15:30,598 --> 00:15:33,559
Grant, the thing is, I know I'm not
supposed to choose the cases I get,

169
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:37,980
but I'm looking for something specific.

170
00:15:39,398 --> 00:15:41,984
Specific? Like what?

171
00:15:45,154 --> 00:15:49,033
I just wanna make sure I'm spending
my time where it'll do the most good.

172
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,619
I gotcha.

173
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:54,538
So plain old indigents
are not good enough for you.

174
00:15:54,622 --> 00:15:58,125
You want the clients that will get you,
you know, in here.

175
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:01,211
Grant, just let me have some tricky ones.

176
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:04,965
Think of all the extra time you'll have
to spend on your egg-stuffers.

177
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:09,136
If I were going to go along with that,
you'd have to take felonies.

178
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:10,137
Sure.

179
00:16:10,138 --> 00:16:12,140
We're talking cases
that are headed for trial.

180
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:15,225
Nothing you can plead out in three
hot minutes with your friendly ADA.

181
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:18,020
I'll take 20. Today.

182
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:21,815
Twenty? That's your offer?

183
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:24,360
Twenty felonies?

184
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:25,527
Yes.

185
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:27,738
Hold this.

186
00:16:31,283 --> 00:16:32,284
Come on.

187
00:16:32,368 --> 00:16:36,205
Hey, Dana, any chance you can tell
the judge I'm running 15 minutes late?

188
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:39,333
Oh, I gotta warn you.

189
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:42,419
Right now we're backed up
like an outhouse at Woodstock.

190
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,471
So possession raps are here.

191
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:54,473
Possession with intent.

192
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:56,433
These are all assault.

193
00:16:56,517 --> 00:16:57,726
Wait.

194
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,604
No. Assault's on the other side
of this shelf.

195
00:17:00,688 --> 00:17:02,981
All of these cases are pending?

196
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:04,650
Pretty much.

197
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:07,569
Had more burnouts than usual
this last quarter.

198
00:17:07,653 --> 00:17:10,406
That's what I call
taking that private firm gig.

199
00:17:10,489 --> 00:17:12,366
Getting that sweet company car.

200
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:14,785
Burning rubber on your way out.

201
00:17:17,413 --> 00:17:21,500
Public intoxication, petty larceny,

202
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,669
destruction of property,

203
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:25,170
DUI,

204
00:17:25,254 --> 00:17:26,672
trespassing,

205
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:29,591
involuntary manslaughter,

206
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:32,261
immigration,

207
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,848
domestic violence.

208
00:17:37,725 --> 00:17:41,729
Or, if you feel like you do want...

209
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,357
Juveniles.

210
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:48,736
Go ahead, have a look around.

211
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:51,196
Let me know which ones you want
so we can kick them over.

212
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,990
I'll get you a box.

213
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:18,724
Flashlight.

214
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:25,856
When you talk to the boss,
you call him Don.

215
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:30,861
He asks you a question,
you tell the truth.

216
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:34,531
Fewest words you can.

217
00:18:36,784 --> 00:18:39,328
If he likes you,
he's gonna give you a bump up.

218
00:18:42,206 --> 00:18:43,206
Hey.

219
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:48,212
Don't think I don't see you, all right?
I see you. I do.

220
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:52,299
Right now, steady is what we need,
you know?

221
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:56,428
And if he doesn't like me?

222
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:01,475
Ah, you'll be fine.

223
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:02,935
Give me the socket wrench.

224
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:16,824
- I gotta hit the head.
- Yeah, yeah.

225
00:19:16,907 --> 00:19:18,534
Straight back to the left.

226
00:19:18,617 --> 00:19:21,245
Hey, don't get any grease on my sink, eh?

227
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:37,344
Yeah?

228
00:19:37,345 --> 00:19:39,221
There's a gate at the back

229
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:42,307
of Salamanca's place.
3:00 a.m. tonight.

230
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:46,186
Unlock it. Open it.
Get the hell away from there.

231
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,688
Who are you?

232
00:19:48,856 --> 00:19:51,525
3:00 a.m. Got it?

233
00:19:53,485 --> 00:19:55,737
You're gonna do this clean, right?

234
00:19:55,821 --> 00:19:59,366
He's got at least seven guys here,
but there's also a couple of old folks,

235
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:02,494
and they've never done anything
to anybody.

236
00:20:17,092 --> 00:20:20,262
After that, I want you both to be thinking
about how to parse out discovery.

237
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:21,847
It's gonna be document heavy,

238
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:25,142
so let's be mindful
of resource management.

239
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:26,685
Howard.

240
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:28,270
- Kim.
- Good to see you.

241
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:29,479
What floor?

242
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:31,398
Three, please.

243
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:36,945
Have you met my associates?
Paul Sheppard and Michelle Avila.

244
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:38,113
I don't think so, hi.

245
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:40,157
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

246
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,287
Guys, this is Kim Wexler.
She's an HHM alum.

247
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:48,040
And now heads up banking
at Schweikart and Cokely.

248
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:49,875
Nice to meet you both.

249
00:20:53,587 --> 00:20:58,425
I'm actually not at Schweikart anymore.
Or in banking, for that matter.

250
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:00,510
Really?

251
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:01,845
As of yesterday.

252
00:21:03,055 --> 00:21:04,222
Take care, Howard.

253
00:21:07,893 --> 00:21:11,396
Kim! Kim! Hang on a sec.

254
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:15,943
Out of curiosity, where did you land?
Reeves and Green?

255
00:21:16,026 --> 00:21:17,486
I'm out on my own again.

256
00:21:18,487 --> 00:21:20,447
Rich let you go?

257
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,699
It wasn't up to him. I left.

258
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:24,242
What about Mesa Verde?

259
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:26,578
I advised them to stay with Schweikart.

260
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,042
I know it's a personal question, Kim,
but can I ask why?

261
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,670
- That is personal. And I have a...
- Spare me a minute.

262
00:21:35,754 --> 00:21:37,881
Please. It's important.

263
00:21:42,094 --> 00:21:43,512
What's up?

264
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:48,934
I wasn't gonna say anything.

265
00:21:50,102 --> 00:21:53,105
Last time I tried to get something
off my chest, it didn't go very well.

266
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:54,648
I just think...

267
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:59,027
before you make any big changes
in your life...

268
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:02,948
There's something about Jimmy
you ought to hear.

269
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,327
Okay.

270
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:12,833
A little while ago,
I offered Jimmy a job at HHM.

271
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,835
I'm guessing he didn't mention it to you.

272
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:20,549
He said he had to think about it.

273
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:26,847
But then the very next night,
he threw bowling balls over my front gate.

274
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:29,182
Bowling balls?

275
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:31,143
Someone could've been really hurt.

276
00:22:31,226 --> 00:22:33,520
More or less destroyed my car.

277
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:36,398
Then, a couple of weeks later,
I'm having lunch with Cliff Main.

278
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:39,901
And I'm accosted by two prostitutes.

279
00:22:40,986 --> 00:22:42,904
Actual prostitutes.

280
00:22:42,988 --> 00:22:45,198
Jimmy had sent them to make a scene.

281
00:22:45,282 --> 00:22:48,285
I confronted Jimmy about it.

282
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:50,454
And after some hemming and hawing...

283
00:22:51,455 --> 00:22:53,248
he all but confessed.

284
00:23:00,005 --> 00:23:02,507
And that's it?

285
00:23:03,508 --> 00:23:04,760
Sorry...

286
00:23:09,264 --> 00:23:10,390
Howard.

287
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:13,643
You really had me going there.

288
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:15,312
Laugh if you want,

289
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,483
but no person in their right mind
would behave the way Jimmy has.

290
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:22,944
We are talking about someone
who is not in control of himself.

291
00:23:23,945 --> 00:23:28,825
You and I both know it makes no sense
to drop a client like Mesa Verde.

292
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:31,411
And I gotta think Jimmy had something
to do with that.

293
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:36,416
Do you have any idea
how insulting that is?

294
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:39,461
I make my own decisions.

295
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:40,796
For my own reasons.

296
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:43,465
You gotta listen to me.
The man needs help.

297
00:23:43,548 --> 00:23:47,219
Howard.
I know Jimmy, and you're wrong.

298
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,268
You know who really knew Jimmy?

299
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:57,729
Chuck.

300
00:24:11,743 --> 00:24:15,205
Open up. Asshole!

301
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,877
Open this door! I want to talk to you!

302
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,178
What?

303
00:24:30,262 --> 00:24:33,849
You didn't think I'd find
your ultra-secret bat cave?

304
00:24:33,932 --> 00:24:39,646
Well, joke's on you, sucker.
I'm your attorney and you will let me in!

305
00:24:49,072 --> 00:24:51,867
I'm not going anywhere. I mean it.

306
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,785
I got nowhere to be.

307
00:24:53,869 --> 00:24:55,954
Open up now!

308
00:24:56,037 --> 00:24:57,539
Hey!

309
00:24:58,748 --> 00:25:00,667
What the hell do you think you're doing?

310
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,043
Ah, there he is.

311
00:25:02,127 --> 00:25:05,046
Not a fan of the surprise pop-in, huh?

312
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,548
Oh, I can't imagine why.

313
00:25:06,631 --> 00:25:09,009
- Keep it down, I got neighbours.
- I will not keep it down.

314
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:11,136
I want answers, okay?

315
00:25:11,219 --> 00:25:13,096
The time has come for you
to level with me,

316
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,890
and I'm not going to leave
until you do.

317
00:25:14,973 --> 00:25:16,474
Inside. Now.

318
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:18,518
Okay, look. Look.

319
00:25:18,602 --> 00:25:20,729
Okay.

320
00:25:22,355 --> 00:25:24,482
You saved my life.

321
00:25:25,942 --> 00:25:27,068
Thank you for that.

322
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:32,365
But from here on out,
I gotta be kept in the loop, man.

323
00:25:32,449 --> 00:25:34,576
It's not my fault that I got ambushed.

324
00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:38,038
Why did I have to lie to Salamanca
about that?

325
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:39,581
Who was I lying for?

326
00:25:39,664 --> 00:25:42,834
Now, you gotta tell me
what is happening, now!

327
00:25:42,918 --> 00:25:44,336
That's not your concern.

328
00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:46,296
Oh, come on.

329
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:47,297
Listen to me.

330
00:25:47,298 --> 00:25:51,010
You are not blowing me off with any
that's not the end of the story crap.

331
00:25:51,092 --> 00:25:52,844
Now, just specifics!

332
00:25:52,928 --> 00:25:55,013
You're asking for information
you can't have.

333
00:26:05,941 --> 00:26:08,443
If anything happens to her...

334
00:26:12,614 --> 00:26:16,451
I can't do this. I can't.

335
00:26:24,251 --> 00:26:25,251
All right.

336
00:26:26,503 --> 00:26:27,503
All right.

337
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:31,633
Now, you listen, and you shut up.

338
00:26:32,842 --> 00:26:37,597
This man has other things on his mind,
he's not thinking about you.

339
00:26:40,183 --> 00:26:43,478
Lalo Salamanca is going to die...

340
00:26:43,561 --> 00:26:44,980
tonight.

341
00:26:47,482 --> 00:26:48,692
Tonight?

342
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:51,486
This time tomorrow, it'll be done.

343
00:26:56,658 --> 00:26:59,244
Oh, okay.

344
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:02,664
Now...

345
00:27:03,957 --> 00:27:05,917
I need you to leave.

346
00:27:07,252 --> 00:27:09,587
I have family coming over.

347
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:37,407
Very nice.

348
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:44,080
Maybe a little less this time?

349
00:27:44,164 --> 00:27:46,082
We've had some bad luck.

350
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:48,376
Luck?

351
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:53,214
Don Eladio,
Gustavo assures me that it's over.

352
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:19,407
Look who it is!

353
00:28:19,491 --> 00:28:21,785
Don Eladio!

354
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:28,500
I knew the Americans couldn't hold you!

355
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:29,541
Bolsa.

356
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:32,838
I understand it was expensive for you
to get out, was it not?

357
00:28:32,921 --> 00:28:35,507
Hey. You paid the gringos?

358
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,759
I thought you would have...

359
00:28:39,219 --> 00:28:40,762
You know how it goes up there.

360
00:28:40,845 --> 00:28:44,015
But don't worry. I got my pound of flesh.

361
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:45,934
What's all this?

362
00:28:46,017 --> 00:28:49,771
It's what Bolsa has brought me from Fring.

363
00:28:50,855 --> 00:28:52,023
Excelente.

364
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:53,775
You think so?

365
00:28:53,858 --> 00:28:55,610
Of course!

366
00:28:56,611 --> 00:28:59,531
Hey, by the way...

367
00:29:00,782 --> 00:29:05,078
I found this key
but I don't know if it's yours.

368
00:29:06,287 --> 00:29:07,956
I don't think so.

369
00:29:09,624 --> 00:29:11,167
That's weird. But...

370
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:14,087
Let's see what it opens.

371
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:27,225
Oh, Magnum P.I.!

372
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:31,229
What a beautiful baby!

373
00:29:32,272 --> 00:29:35,483
She's so smooth.

374
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:36,567
Eh, Bolsa?

375
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:39,112
Very smooth.

376
00:29:41,322 --> 00:29:42,866
Perhaps there's...

377
00:29:42,949 --> 00:29:44,868
something in the trunk?

378
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:48,830
Let's find out.

379
00:29:48,913 --> 00:29:49,873
Don.

380
00:29:49,874 --> 00:29:53,418
On this model the trunk
is in the front.

381
00:29:56,754 --> 00:29:58,840
It's a frunk.

382
00:30:02,135 --> 00:30:03,553
Let's see.

383
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:05,722
Frunk.

384
00:30:06,806 --> 00:30:08,433
A present!

385
00:30:09,517 --> 00:30:12,061
What is this?

386
00:30:12,145 --> 00:30:16,483
This is the man.

387
00:30:19,068 --> 00:30:20,153
Right, Bolsa?

388
00:30:20,236 --> 00:30:23,156
This is showmanship!

389
00:30:26,242 --> 00:30:27,160
Don Eladio.

390
00:30:27,161 --> 00:30:30,371
I'd like you to meet Ignacio Varga.

391
00:30:30,455 --> 00:30:34,209
He's our new man up north.

392
00:30:36,377 --> 00:30:38,004
Not a Salamanca?

393
00:30:38,087 --> 00:30:41,591
He's been running things
since Hector got sick.

394
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:44,344
He's a friend of Tuco's.

395
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:50,391
Tuco. Really?

396
00:30:51,726 --> 00:30:54,646
You okay in there?

397
00:30:56,105 --> 00:30:58,525
I'm joking with you.

398
00:30:58,608 --> 00:31:02,987
Let's talk, you and I.
We'll get to know each other.

399
00:31:09,911 --> 00:31:11,120
So.

400
00:31:11,204 --> 00:31:14,290
How do you think you'll make me money?

401
00:31:29,681 --> 00:31:32,684
I'm going to sell as much stuff
as you can send me.

402
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:36,563
I'm gonna open up new territory.

403
00:31:37,772 --> 00:31:40,858
Keep the competition out.

404
00:31:40,942 --> 00:31:42,819
New territory?

405
00:31:44,028 --> 00:31:46,364
Who are you taking this territory from?

406
00:31:47,448 --> 00:31:48,491
To start with...

407
00:31:50,285 --> 00:31:52,537
Biker gangs.

408
00:31:54,038 --> 00:31:56,583
Biker gangs?

409
00:31:56,666 --> 00:31:58,209
Bikers?

410
00:32:06,467 --> 00:32:10,305
So you're going to start a war

411
00:32:10,388 --> 00:32:13,266
with a bunch of gringo bikers?

412
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:15,476
This is your plan.

413
00:32:19,731 --> 00:32:21,649
Don Eladio.

414
00:32:22,775 --> 00:32:25,320
These gangs are divided.

415
00:32:26,321 --> 00:32:30,950
We turn them against each other.

416
00:32:32,243 --> 00:32:38,082
Then we take them out one at a time.

417
00:32:46,174 --> 00:32:48,760
So you are a businessman.

418
00:32:53,014 --> 00:32:55,141
Ignacio Varga.

419
00:32:58,478 --> 00:33:00,938
What do you want?

420
00:33:02,315 --> 00:33:04,817
- What do I want?
- Yes.

421
00:33:08,154 --> 00:33:09,989
Respect.

422
00:33:11,741 --> 00:33:16,245
I want to make my own decisions.
Go my own way.

423
00:33:16,954 --> 00:33:22,168
I don't want anyone
to even think of playing me.

424
00:33:22,251 --> 00:33:27,924
And I don't want to be looking
over my shoulder.

425
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:33,846
You don't want to be looking
over your shoulder?

426
00:33:36,724 --> 00:33:40,520
You're in the wrong business, my friend.

427
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,692
You're all right.

428
00:33:56,494 --> 00:33:57,662
Salud.

429
00:34:24,856 --> 00:34:26,441
Really?

430
00:34:28,067 --> 00:34:29,152
Really.

431
00:34:31,612 --> 00:34:33,072
How do you know?

432
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:36,784
I talked to my guy.

433
00:34:36,868 --> 00:34:42,290
- Lalo's in Mexico, and he's staying there.
- But you said he might call someone...

434
00:34:43,666 --> 00:34:45,084
He's not gonna do that.

435
00:34:45,168 --> 00:34:50,214
- Your guy? How does he know for sure?
- He's not gonna tell me, but he knows.

436
00:34:50,298 --> 00:34:54,260
- And you believe him?
- Yeah. I do.

437
00:34:54,343 --> 00:34:56,763
So, we're safe?

438
00:34:57,805 --> 00:34:59,265
Yeah.

439
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,145
My God.

440
00:35:05,146 --> 00:35:06,773
Oh, my God.

441
00:35:08,649 --> 00:35:11,110
Oh, that's great.

442
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,823
It's great, right?

443
00:35:17,575 --> 00:35:22,997
It's... It's...
So, what's wrong? It's over.

444
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:27,752
This time.

445
00:35:29,253 --> 00:35:31,547
There's not gonna be a next time.

446
00:35:45,102 --> 00:35:46,562
Kim...

447
00:35:47,647 --> 00:35:49,732
it's been a rough ride.

448
00:35:51,067 --> 00:35:54,195
I've been thinking a lot, and...

449
00:35:56,531 --> 00:35:58,783
we should probably just check out
and go home.

450
00:35:58,866 --> 00:36:05,414
I packed my stuff, I think
I got yours too. Just double-check.

451
00:36:09,919 --> 00:36:12,129
We already paid for the night.

452
00:36:14,048 --> 00:36:16,384
What about the spa and all that?

453
00:36:17,385 --> 00:36:19,637
We haven't even tried room service.

454
00:36:22,014 --> 00:36:24,350
Kim, don't you just wanna go home?

455
00:36:28,938 --> 00:36:34,068
A veil of white cheddar draped
over coarse ground Angus beef patty,

456
00:36:34,151 --> 00:36:37,864
locally grown chilli pepper,
house-baked sesame seed buns

457
00:36:37,947 --> 00:36:44,579
served with golden brown shoestring
potatoes seasoned with truffle salt.

458
00:36:46,163 --> 00:36:47,164
Truffle salt.

459
00:36:49,417 --> 00:36:51,586
I'm hungry, Jimmy.

460
00:36:51,669 --> 00:36:55,172
And there is nothing to eat
at home anyway, so...

461
00:36:57,758 --> 00:36:58,676
why not?

462
00:37:11,898 --> 00:37:15,526
So I ran into Howard
at the courthouse today.

463
00:37:18,404 --> 00:37:19,989
Yeah?

464
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:21,699
Told me something about...

465
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,745
bowling balls destroying his car.

466
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:33,961
Prostitutes harassing him at lunch.

467
00:37:38,758 --> 00:37:41,719
For what it's worth,
that all happened before we...

468
00:37:41,802 --> 00:37:43,137
Before we got married?

469
00:37:44,138 --> 00:37:45,389
Yeah.

470
00:37:49,518 --> 00:37:52,021
You know why Hamlin told me all that?

471
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:57,193
It was for my own good.

472
00:37:58,736 --> 00:38:04,408
Like I'm just waiting for him
to ride up on his white horse?

473
00:38:04,492 --> 00:38:06,202
It's...

474
00:38:06,285 --> 00:38:08,621
It's all about him.

475
00:38:08,704 --> 00:38:12,083
It's always all about him.

476
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:14,502
The guy is in love with himself.

477
00:38:15,962 --> 00:38:18,381
He needed to be taken down a peg.

478
00:38:19,423 --> 00:38:21,217
So...

479
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:26,764
what's next?

480
00:38:28,516 --> 00:38:32,311
You went after his car.
You went after his reputation, so...

481
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:38,067
I think maybe the next thing is...

482
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:40,778
his hair.

483
00:38:41,988 --> 00:38:44,865
Right? Suppose...

484
00:38:44,949 --> 00:38:50,246
I'm just brainstorming here,
but suppose we slip him a mickey.

485
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:54,875
And then, while he's out,
we get out the old electric clippers.

486
00:38:58,629 --> 00:39:00,339
Shave him bald.

487
00:39:02,133 --> 00:39:03,968
Nair.

488
00:39:05,052 --> 00:39:06,387
What?

489
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:10,933
It's an old gag,

490
00:39:11,017 --> 00:39:15,187
but sneak into his country club
and put Nair in his shampoo bottle.

491
00:39:15,271 --> 00:39:17,606
And then he takes a shower, and...

492
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:19,358
- Hair falls out. Nice.
- Yeah.

493
00:39:19,442 --> 00:39:22,236
Or, or, or...

494
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:26,907
we pour a barrel of chlorine
into his swimming pool.

495
00:39:26,991 --> 00:39:28,409
- So then...
- Bleaches his hair

496
00:39:28,492 --> 00:39:29,994
and eyebrows, everything.

497
00:39:30,077 --> 00:39:31,662
Yes, and the eyebrows.

498
00:39:34,123 --> 00:39:35,916
Or. Or...

499
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,421
Or we break into his house,

500
00:39:40,504 --> 00:39:44,550
replace all the fluffy toilet paper rolls
with single ply.

501
00:39:44,633 --> 00:39:47,762
Ouch. Hit him where he lives.

502
00:39:47,845 --> 00:39:53,642
Or, whatever tanning lotion
he uses, we replace it with sunblock.

503
00:39:53,726 --> 00:39:55,770
He gets in his tanning bed and...

504
00:39:55,853 --> 00:39:57,980
Waste of time.

505
00:39:58,064 --> 00:39:59,064
Or...

506
00:40:00,274 --> 00:40:01,274
Or...

507
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:03,611
Or what?

508
00:40:05,112 --> 00:40:07,615
We'd never do it, but...

509
00:40:10,201 --> 00:40:12,078
Never do what?

510
00:40:13,954 --> 00:40:15,831
What if...

511
00:40:18,459 --> 00:40:21,754
What if Howard does something terrible?

512
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:29,386
Like he murders a waiter
for putting butter in his cauliflower?

513
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:32,973
No, I mean really bad.

514
00:40:34,475 --> 00:40:36,769
Like misconduct.

515
00:40:36,852 --> 00:40:39,605
You know, misappropriating funds or...

516
00:40:40,606 --> 00:40:42,942
bribing witnesses, something like that.

517
00:40:43,025 --> 00:40:46,695
You know what that would mean
for the Sandpiper case?

518
00:40:46,779 --> 00:40:50,574
A big class action suit?
It could tank the whole thing.

519
00:40:52,743 --> 00:40:55,329
Cliff Main's hair would be on fire.

520
00:40:57,915 --> 00:40:59,166
He'd get it settled.

521
00:41:00,709 --> 00:41:02,336
Pronto.

522
00:41:04,922 --> 00:41:05,922
He would?

523
00:41:06,757 --> 00:41:11,470
Yeah. Think about how much
they've put into that case.

524
00:41:12,555 --> 00:41:16,100
Almost two years of work?

525
00:41:17,726 --> 00:41:20,938
If it fell apart now, they'd get nothing.
So yeah.

526
00:41:21,021 --> 00:41:23,357
Cliff Main would take whatever
Sandpiper was offering.

527
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,443
I already tried like hell
to get Sandpiper settled.

528
00:41:26,527 --> 00:41:29,321
Yeah, but you went about it wrong.

529
00:41:29,405 --> 00:41:34,243
Sorry, but this is how you do it.

530
00:41:38,038 --> 00:41:40,416
And it's not like
the old folks get stiffed.

531
00:41:40,499 --> 00:41:46,463
If Sandpiper settled now,
they might each get 15, 20 bucks less,

532
00:41:46,547 --> 00:41:49,884
but they get their money now
while they can still use it.

533
00:41:51,427 --> 00:41:53,470
And the lawyers get paid.

534
00:41:55,723 --> 00:41:57,474
And the lawyers get paid.

535
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,729
How much of the common fund do you get?

536
00:42:04,607 --> 00:42:08,527
We get 20 percent of the common fund.

537
00:42:10,613 --> 00:42:11,947
I'm just... I'm...

538
00:42:13,073 --> 00:42:16,243
- Forget it, okay?
- Okay.

539
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:05,602
Hey.

540
00:44:05,686 --> 00:44:06,895
Hey.

541
00:44:08,897 --> 00:44:10,357
Have a seat.

542
00:44:32,338 --> 00:44:34,548
Hey, you did good today, huh?

543
00:44:34,631 --> 00:44:36,717
Tomorrow, I'll show you around.

544
00:44:38,218 --> 00:44:39,887
When you go back up north...

545
00:44:40,888 --> 00:44:43,724
you're gonna be halfway
to being a Salamanca, eh?

546
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:45,976
Thanks.

547
00:44:53,317 --> 00:44:55,194
Another night owl, huh?
You don't sleep?

548
00:44:56,779 --> 00:44:59,281
No. Not tonight.

549
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:03,869
Yeah, I never sleep much.

550
00:45:05,704 --> 00:45:07,456
An hour, maybe two.

551
00:45:08,457 --> 00:45:10,042
It's enough.

552
00:45:12,461 --> 00:45:13,670
When it's like this...

553
00:45:17,049 --> 00:45:18,133
that's when I can think.

554
00:45:20,761 --> 00:45:24,515
I get my best ideas
when everybody else is asleep.

555
00:45:27,184 --> 00:45:29,395
Some people, they call it a curse.

556
00:45:29,478 --> 00:45:30,478
I like it.

557
00:45:31,855 --> 00:45:33,482
I don't know.

558
00:45:38,278 --> 00:45:40,239
I'd rather get some shuteye.

559
00:45:41,824 --> 00:45:43,867
And yet here we are.

560
00:45:55,754 --> 00:45:57,423
Got anything stronger?

561
00:45:59,091 --> 00:46:00,759
Now you're talking.

562
00:46:02,344 --> 00:46:08,684
In the bar, bottom shelf, decanter,
that's the good stuff.

563
00:46:08,767 --> 00:46:10,394
Two glasses.

564
00:46:51,727 --> 00:46:55,022
There he is.
I thought you got lost.

565
00:47:10,078 --> 00:47:12,623
You ever had Louis XIII?

566
00:47:12,706 --> 00:47:14,333
I don't think so.

567
00:47:14,416 --> 00:47:16,627
You're in for a treat.

568
00:47:25,344 --> 00:47:28,764
To sleep and those who need it.

569
00:47:28,847 --> 00:47:30,015
To sleep.

570
00:47:36,688 --> 00:47:38,273
What the hell is that?

571
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:46,865
These morons have no respect!

572
00:47:46,949 --> 00:47:48,158
Ciro!

573
00:47:48,242 --> 00:47:50,369
What the hell is that, asshole?

574
00:48:33,579 --> 00:48:35,831
Inside. In the kitchen.

575
00:48:49,761 --> 00:48:51,513
Ciro!

576
00:48:51,597 --> 00:48:55,309
It's always the same!

577
00:48:55,392 --> 00:48:58,061
Ciro! Get in here!

578
00:48:58,145 --> 00:48:59,646
Ciro.

579
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:00,646
What's up, boss?

580
00:49:00,647 --> 00:49:03,401
- What did you do? Are you smoking again?
- Boss, I didn't really.

581
00:49:03,483 --> 00:49:04,735
Ciro. Ciro.

582
00:49:04,818 --> 00:49:09,573
Don't lie to me. Don't blame Miguel.
I'm tired of these lies.

583
00:49:09,656 --> 00:49:15,203
Boss, I swear to God, I got myself
a lighter. See? It wasn't me!

584
00:51:53,028 --> 00:51:56,448
Go. Find where it comes out.

585
00:52:09,002 --> 00:52:10,045
What do you see?

586
00:52:11,046 --> 00:52:14,132
It's straight.
At least a hundred metres long.

587
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:19,221
I can see his blood. He's not far.

588
00:52:30,899 --> 00:52:32,192
What was that?

589
00:52:32,275 --> 00:52:33,527
Was that him?

590
00:53:20,532 --> 00:53:22,409
What do you want?

591
00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:25,370
I'll have a little of everything.

592
00:53:27,205 --> 00:53:30,083
Actually, leave off the mint chip.

593
00:53:36,298 --> 00:53:42,554
I set the alarm for 6:00 since we have
to check out and go home before work.

594
00:53:43,555 --> 00:53:46,850
That's a solid two and a half hours.
Sounds good.

595
00:54:04,534 --> 00:54:06,995
So, what would you do with it?

596
00:54:10,332 --> 00:54:12,626
I don't know. What would you?

597
00:54:14,336 --> 00:54:17,631
I'd hire Stef away from Schweikart.

598
00:54:18,882 --> 00:54:22,427
I'd hire Bruce from HHM.

599
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:23,845
I'd get Viola.

600
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:28,934
I'd rent the smallest, shittiest office
I could find at a courthouse

601
00:54:29,017 --> 00:54:31,519
and open a pro bono practice.

602
00:54:32,646 --> 00:54:35,273
Give regular people
the kind of representation

603
00:54:35,357 --> 00:54:37,651
usually only millionaires get.

604
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:41,529
I was gonna say, we buy a house.

605
00:54:41,613 --> 00:54:44,324
Sorry, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

606
00:54:44,407 --> 00:54:45,784
We could do both.

607
00:54:47,202 --> 00:54:51,456
Last I heard, Sandpiper was willing
to go to 26 million.

608
00:54:52,457 --> 00:54:56,670
Wow, a third of that is 8.5.

609
00:54:56,753 --> 00:54:59,464
- And 20 percent of that is...
- Around two mil.

610
00:55:04,678 --> 00:55:06,972
But it's not happening.

611
00:55:09,099 --> 00:55:10,475
Come on, Kim.

612
00:55:11,601 --> 00:55:16,481
We're not talking about a bar trick here.
We're talking about scorched earth.

613
00:55:18,316 --> 00:55:20,443
We would have to hurt him.

614
00:55:20,527 --> 00:55:21,653
Hurt him bad.

615
00:55:22,737 --> 00:55:24,577
To get a bunch of lawyers
to run for the exits,

616
00:55:24,656 --> 00:55:27,200
Howard would have
to have done something...

617
00:55:27,283 --> 00:55:28,743
unforgivable.

618
00:55:28,827 --> 00:55:33,206
At the end of it, he might never be able
to practise law again.

619
00:55:34,499 --> 00:55:38,753
He doesn't deserve that.
And who knows if we could pull it off?

620
00:55:42,549 --> 00:55:48,179
Okay, maybe we could pull it off, yeah,
but we won't.

621
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:58,106
We're talking about a career setback.

622
00:55:59,858 --> 00:56:03,737
A career setback for one lawyer.

623
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:09,451
Yeah, I know, you could help
a lot of people. I get it, but...

624
00:56:12,328 --> 00:56:14,080
Kim, doing this...

625
00:56:15,582 --> 00:56:17,083
It's not you.

626
00:56:18,084 --> 00:56:22,130
Okay? You would not be okay with it.

627
00:56:22,213 --> 00:56:24,549
Not in the cold light of day.

628
00:56:27,969 --> 00:56:29,304
Wouldn't I?

629
00:56:40,565 --> 00:56:44,402
I'm gonna go take a shower,
so I don't have to in the morning.

630
00:56:47,655 --> 00:56:50,784
Kim, you're shitting me, right?

631
00:57:49,884 --> 00:57:52,846
There's a middle man.

632
00:57:52,929 --> 00:57:54,764
I don't know who hired us.

633
00:57:55,765 --> 00:57:57,517
That's okay.

634
00:57:58,977 --> 00:58:00,728
I do.

635
00:58:14,742 --> 00:58:16,327
You're going to call to them.

636
00:58:17,328 --> 00:58:21,040
And you're going to tell them
it was tough...

637
00:58:22,292 --> 00:58:23,751
but the job's done.

638
00:58:26,546 --> 00:58:28,673
I'll help you.
