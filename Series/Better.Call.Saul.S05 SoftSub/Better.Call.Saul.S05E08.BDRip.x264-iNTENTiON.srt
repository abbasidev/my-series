1
00:00:38,581 --> 00:00:40,041
Quit it.

2
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:41,126
Make me.

3
00:00:43,253 --> 00:00:44,713
Make me, man.

4
00:00:45,922 --> 00:00:47,173
I'll make you.

5
00:00:47,882 --> 00:00:49,467
Knock it off.

6
00:03:14,487 --> 00:03:15,989
Hey.

7
00:03:16,072 --> 00:03:20,702
I got something for him,
if he's still interested.

8
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:45,727
What's so funny?

9
00:03:50,607 --> 00:03:54,027
- Ah, you wouldn't get it.
- Okay.

10
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,362
Okay, here's what you're gonna do.

11
00:03:56,446 --> 00:04:01,993
You're gonna take 25 South to Las Cruces.
You can pick up 10 West from there.

12
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:04,913
Hey, write this down, man, es complicado.

13
00:04:04,996 --> 00:04:06,789
Ten West at Las Cruces.

14
00:04:06,873 --> 00:04:11,711
A little past Deming
there's a state road. It's 146.

15
00:04:11,794 --> 00:04:17,717
Follow the signs to Antelope Wells
until Mile Marker 223.

16
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,887
Turn off at the dirt road
and take it 30 miles south.

17
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:25,558
- Thirty miles down a dirt road?
- Fewer eyes out in the desert, you know?

18
00:04:25,642 --> 00:04:26,851
Actually, it's 31.6.

19
00:04:26,935 --> 00:04:29,270
So make sure that you use the little,
you know,

20
00:04:29,354 --> 00:04:31,814
trip metre thing on the odometer,
whatever.

21
00:04:31,898 --> 00:04:35,109
Anyway, once you get there,
you're gonna see a well.

22
00:04:35,193 --> 00:04:37,695
It's really old.
You know, broken down.

23
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:40,073
What does this well look like?

24
00:04:40,156 --> 00:04:42,617
It looks like a well.
It's the only one out there.

25
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,620
- Can you see it from the road?
- You'll see it. Don't worry about it.

26
00:04:45,703 --> 00:04:48,623
My cousins are gonna meet you there
with the money, 9 a.m.

27
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:50,833
- You'll like them. They're good boys.
- I'll bet.

28
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:56,214
Hey, I have an idea.
Why not have these cousins of yours

29
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:58,633
bring the money just all the way here?

30
00:04:58,716 --> 00:05:00,635
Cut out the middleman.

31
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:02,428
Yeah, see, the thing is,

32
00:05:02,512 --> 00:05:06,307
this whole thing has
to be very low-profile, you know?

33
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:08,309
There are people,

34
00:05:08,393 --> 00:05:11,938
let's say competitors of mine,
people who wanna keep me in here.

35
00:05:12,021 --> 00:05:13,021
And so, you know,

36
00:05:13,064 --> 00:05:17,068
my cousins come into town,
those people will notice.

37
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:21,364
What about Nacho Varga, right?
Would your competitors notice him?

38
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:24,993
He seems like he's got
a pretty good head on his shoulders.

39
00:05:25,076 --> 00:05:27,078
You mean Ignacio?

40
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:31,582
Yeah, sure, I mean,
he's good for a lot of things.

41
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,876
But with 7 million?

42
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,255
A guy like that could get real dumb
real fast, you know?

43
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:40,508
Hey, you're the right guy for this.
You're nobody.

44
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:44,012
I mean, no offence,
but nobody's gonna look twice at you.

45
00:05:45,722 --> 00:05:47,640
Yeah, sure...

46
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,479
Hey, look, maybe this isn't your thing,
you know? I mean, that's okay. I get it.

47
00:05:53,563 --> 00:05:57,150
You did good in court.
We'll leave it at that.

48
00:05:58,151 --> 00:06:01,029
Well, thanks, that's...
I appreciate that.

49
00:06:01,112 --> 00:06:02,947
Don't worry about it.

50
00:06:03,031 --> 00:06:05,283
I'll find somebody else, you know?

51
00:06:06,284 --> 00:06:10,747
Yeah. So I guess we're done here.

52
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,874
Guess so.

53
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,127
All right.

54
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,379
I will... I'm gonna shred these.

55
00:06:18,463 --> 00:06:19,672
And...

56
00:06:20,673 --> 00:06:26,137
if there's anything else you need,
any legal services...

57
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,974
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got your number. See you.

58
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,439
This stupid thing.

59
00:06:41,486 --> 00:06:43,446
Hundred thousand?

60
00:06:49,744 --> 00:06:51,454
Dollars?

61
00:06:52,997 --> 00:06:55,750
- Yeah.
- That's a lot of money.

62
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:58,544
To bring back 7 mil?
And I'm the best guy to do it?

63
00:06:58,628 --> 00:07:04,092
That's actually less than
2 percent commission. I think it's right.

64
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:11,599
So 100K for a little drive
through the desert, huh?

65
00:07:14,143 --> 00:07:16,270
That's the price.

66
00:07:21,943 --> 00:07:22,943
Done.

67
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:31,577
Hey, I'm home.

68
00:07:31,661 --> 00:07:34,413
Great. I'll be out in a sec.

69
00:07:36,624 --> 00:07:38,376
Evening shower, huh?

70
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:41,879
Yeah. Got an early day tomorrow.

71
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:47,135
Hey, I hope you're hungry.
I'm making fajitas.

72
00:07:48,136 --> 00:07:50,847
- You're cooking?
- Yeah, why not?

73
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,891
I picked up some strip steak
on the way home,

74
00:07:53,975 --> 00:07:55,852
and it's been marinating
for a couple hours

75
00:07:55,935 --> 00:07:59,438
in a secret blend of herbs and spices.

76
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:00,982
- Really?
- Yeah.

77
00:08:01,065 --> 00:08:04,527
Something I like to call Old El Paso.

78
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,238
It sounds exotic.

79
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:10,032
It'll be delicious, you'll see.

80
00:08:10,116 --> 00:08:14,162
I... I have some business news.

81
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:20,209
You're a friend of the cartel?
Is that it?

82
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:23,254
Not exactly.

83
00:08:25,423 --> 00:08:26,966
Maybe.

84
00:08:29,635 --> 00:08:31,262
You got him bail?

85
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:35,183
Some evidence fell into my lap.
I was kind of obligated to use it.

86
00:08:35,266 --> 00:08:37,268
You know, for my client.

87
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:41,647
When you said you couldn't do it,
I knew you'd find a way.

88
00:08:42,815 --> 00:08:46,027
There's a complication.

89
00:08:47,028 --> 00:08:49,155
Remember that time you had a PD case

90
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:52,742
with the kid whose parents kicked him out
because he got caught with a joint?

91
00:08:52,825 --> 00:08:53,825
Yeah.

92
00:08:53,868 --> 00:08:57,246
And you had to drive all the way out
to the uncle's house,

93
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:58,873
I think it was in Moriarty,

94
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:00,416
to pick up the bail? Well...

95
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:05,129
Wait, what? So, what, you're saying
you're gonna pick up Salamanca's bail?

96
00:09:05,213 --> 00:09:09,217
Yeah, only it's a little further
than Moriarty and a little more money.

97
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,220
- How much?
- Seven.

98
00:09:13,221 --> 00:09:15,056
- Seven thousand?
- Million.

99
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:17,767
- Seven million?
- Yeah.

100
00:09:18,768 --> 00:09:23,397
You're going to pick up $7 million
of cartel money?

101
00:09:23,481 --> 00:09:26,651
I know what you're thinking,
but it's safe. Completely.

102
00:09:26,734 --> 00:09:28,361
A quick drive down by the border,

103
00:09:28,444 --> 00:09:29,362
- I'll be back.
- The border?

104
00:09:29,363 --> 00:09:32,865
Jimmy, you are an attorney,
not a bagman.

105
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:35,576
There's no amount of money
that is worth this.

106
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,621
- Can't his people do it?
- He trusts me.

107
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:40,623
I'm his attorney, that's it.

108
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:43,084
You're making a bigger deal out of this
than you need to.

109
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,044
- What?
- I will pick it up in the morning,

110
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:46,379
I will be done

111
00:09:46,462 --> 00:09:48,214
and I'll be home before you will.

112
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:50,549
Okay. Then I'm going with you.

113
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:53,719
Well, they're only expecting me.
You know, one guy?

114
00:09:53,803 --> 00:09:57,265
I mean, that's kind of the whole point.
You know, security through obscurity.

115
00:09:57,348 --> 00:10:00,059
- Jimmy, this is insane, I...
- No, listen, it's just little old me

116
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:02,103
in my little old Suzuki Esteem.

117
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:05,606
And there has never been
more than 50 bucks in an Esteem

118
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,275
in the history of Esteems.

119
00:10:07,358 --> 00:10:10,027
So no one's gonna look at me twice.

120
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:13,823
You sound like you are talking yourself
into this.

121
00:10:14,824 --> 00:10:18,077
I will be okay. I swear.

122
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,914
If I smell even the faintest whiff
of anything wrong,

123
00:10:21,998 --> 00:10:24,333
I'll be out of there like a shot.

124
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:28,671
I don't like this.

125
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:32,258
I don't want you to do it.

126
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:42,768
Kim, listen.

127
00:10:42,852 --> 00:10:47,064
I swear, okay? I'll be fine.

128
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:52,022
L... Lawyer.

129
00:12:52,106 --> 00:12:58,946
From Lalo. Eduardo sent me
to pick up the dinero.

130
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:24,263
I'll just take these back to Lalo.

131
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:29,435
You guys are just gonna... Just go?

132
00:13:30,436 --> 00:13:32,146
Well, that'll work.

133
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,901
All right.

134
00:14:00,758 --> 00:14:03,969
<i>Seven million dollars
of cash in the trunk</i>

135
00:14:04,053 --> 00:14:07,640
<i>Seven million dollars of cash</i>

136
00:14:07,723 --> 00:14:12,228
<i>Take one dollar, pass it a rollar</i>

137
00:14:13,229 --> 00:14:18,984
<i>Six million
nine hundred ninety-nine thousand</i>

138
00:14:19,068 --> 00:14:21,153
<i>Crappy service</i>

139
00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:27,493
<i>Six million
nine hundred ninety-nine thousand</i>

140
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:31,956
<i>Ninety-nine dollars of cash
in the truck</i>

141
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:38,587
<i>Take a buck, pass it for luck</i>

142
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:43,300
<i>Six million, nine hundred
ninety-nine thousand, nine...</i>

143
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:47,972
<i>Nine hundred ninety-nine...</i>

144
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:49,557
Go by.

145
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:22,590
Oh, shit, shit, shit.

146
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:34,184
Oh, nuts.

147
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:38,439
Okay, yeah.

148
00:15:38,522 --> 00:15:41,775
Coming out. Slowly.

149
00:15:58,042 --> 00:16:03,422
I think... I think I have a sense
of what you want here. It's in the trunk.

150
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:06,175
Yeah, good. Take those.

151
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:42,419
What? No, no.
That's not what he meant.

152
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:44,296
No, this is a mistake.
It's a big...

153
00:16:48,884 --> 00:16:49,885
No!

154
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:07,124
You hit?

155
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:14,131
- Hit?
- Are you shot?

156
00:20:22,014 --> 00:20:23,515
Get up.

157
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:26,643
Shot?

158
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,646
You're in shock.

159
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:34,526
You stay here and breathe.

160
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:26,178
Hey.

161
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:31,727
You're alive. Focus on that.

162
00:22:37,983 --> 00:22:40,068
You'll be okay.

163
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:22,903
Get out. The alternator's shot.

164
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:26,073
Literally.

165
00:23:57,771 --> 00:24:02,234
All right. I'm gonna need you
to put your back into this.

166
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,487
Push!

167
00:24:21,837 --> 00:24:26,174
Wait! Wait, wait, wait!

168
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:29,469
What is it?

169
00:24:30,887 --> 00:24:32,597
Where is it?

170
00:25:29,821 --> 00:25:31,907
Did you know all this was gonna happen?

171
00:25:32,908 --> 00:25:35,952
If I did, I would've brought more guys.

172
00:25:36,036 --> 00:25:39,331
Let's get that to where it belongs.
This way.

173
00:25:39,414 --> 00:25:42,083
Well, home is that way.

174
00:25:44,461 --> 00:25:47,172
One of those guys got away in a car.

175
00:25:47,255 --> 00:25:50,300
On the road. This road.

176
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:52,677
We gotta get off it.

177
00:26:45,188 --> 00:26:47,107
Big mistake...

178
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,775
discontinuing...

179
00:26:48,858 --> 00:26:50,235
thousand dollar bill.

180
00:26:50,318 --> 00:26:52,362
Big.

181
00:26:54,614 --> 00:26:56,992
These would've been so much lighter.

182
00:27:01,329 --> 00:27:02,747
Hey.

183
00:27:03,999 --> 00:27:07,377
How about we take turns
with these bad boys, you know?

184
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,379
So we both stay fresh?

185
00:27:13,258 --> 00:27:14,884
Fine.

186
00:27:20,515 --> 00:27:25,020
- I got an idea. Let's dig a hole.
- A hole?

187
00:27:25,103 --> 00:27:27,939
Yeah. Walk out of here,
get to civilisation,

188
00:27:28,023 --> 00:27:29,899
drive back, pick it up.

189
00:27:29,983 --> 00:27:32,527
Work smarter, not harder.

190
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:33,778
You'll never find it.

191
00:27:33,862 --> 00:27:37,032
Oh, I will because
I'll memorise the landmarks.

192
00:27:37,115 --> 00:27:42,287
Like this tree? You can't miss it.
That hill, that's distinctive.

193
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:45,540
It's got a hill shape.

194
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:46,875
Yeah, very different

195
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:51,504
from the couple dozen trees we've seen
on hillsides that we walked past.

196
00:27:51,588 --> 00:27:55,300
I will remember. I will find this tree.

197
00:28:04,851 --> 00:28:06,936
That's hard pack.

198
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:10,398
If you manage to dig a hole big enough
for those two bags,

199
00:28:10,482 --> 00:28:12,817
you might as well dig one for yourself.

200
00:28:16,363 --> 00:28:20,575
Oh, come on. That's not gonna work.

201
00:28:23,328 --> 00:28:25,455
You are wasting energy.

202
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:28,083
I'm almost there.

203
00:28:36,007 --> 00:28:38,093
It's working.

204
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:46,142
Stop.

205
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:51,064
Put that away. They'll see it.

206
00:28:51,147 --> 00:28:54,275
You take off anything
that'll catch the light.

207
00:28:55,151 --> 00:28:57,862
- Is it him?
- Oh, yeah.

208
00:28:58,863 --> 00:29:01,366
It looks like they're doing a grid search.

209
00:29:02,367 --> 00:29:03,367
Meaning?

210
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:06,704
Meaning they found your car.

211
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:11,102
I'd go easy on that.

212
00:30:31,623 --> 00:30:32,957
Hey, why are we camping?

213
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:35,919
I mean, shouldn't we keep walking?
It's cooler at night.

214
00:30:36,002 --> 00:30:37,295
You go out there in the dark,

215
00:30:37,378 --> 00:30:40,423
you're gonna break your leg
in a prairie-dog hole.

216
00:31:15,124 --> 00:31:17,210
Hey, we gotta be halfway there, right?

217
00:31:17,293 --> 00:31:18,878
Almost.

218
00:31:18,962 --> 00:31:20,922
Almost.

219
00:31:45,113 --> 00:31:49,284
I should have been home hours ago.
This will be tearing her up.

220
00:31:49,367 --> 00:31:51,869
Oh, she's just gonna think
you're out catting around.

221
00:31:51,953 --> 00:31:53,788
No, she won't.

222
00:31:53,871 --> 00:31:57,667
She's gonna think I'm chopped to pieces,
dead in some ditch.

223
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,628
And why is she gonna think that?

224
00:32:03,172 --> 00:32:05,258
Are you saying she knows
what you're doing?

225
00:32:06,259 --> 00:32:10,138
Not, you know, the details.

226
00:32:10,221 --> 00:32:14,726
She knows I'm picking up money
down by the border, that's all.

227
00:32:14,809 --> 00:32:17,770
You told your girlfriend
what you're doing?

228
00:32:17,854 --> 00:32:19,188
My wife.

229
00:32:20,189 --> 00:32:23,401
- Wife?
- Yeah, wife.

230
00:32:24,402 --> 00:32:26,446
Congratulations.

231
00:32:27,447 --> 00:32:30,325
And what's your wife gonna do
with this information, do you think?

232
00:32:30,408 --> 00:32:32,368
- Call the cops?
- No.

233
00:32:32,452 --> 00:32:35,622
No? People get scared, call the cops.
Pretty standard.

234
00:32:35,705 --> 00:32:37,290
No, she's not calling any cops.

235
00:32:37,373 --> 00:32:40,710
Her mother. Girls at the book club.

236
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:43,129
Gonna call her boss,
tell her about her missing husband.

237
00:32:43,212 --> 00:32:45,923
No, she's not doing any of that, okay?
She knows better.

238
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:49,969
She's just gonna be scared
out of her mind, is all.

239
00:32:51,888 --> 00:32:55,600
Well, let's hope you're right.

240
00:32:59,395 --> 00:33:01,189
She knows.

241
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,399
She's in the game now.

242
00:33:03,483 --> 00:33:06,778
What? No.
She's not in the game, all right?

243
00:33:06,861 --> 00:33:09,155
She's not even game-adjacent.

244
00:33:09,238 --> 00:33:14,285
I just told her the truth.
A little slice of the truth. That's all.

245
00:33:16,162 --> 00:33:19,207
- She's not in the game.
- Yeah.

246
00:33:30,718 --> 00:33:35,264
Well, I can't make a fire.
Our guy may still be out there.

247
00:34:00,206 --> 00:34:01,999
I got two of these, you want one?

248
00:34:03,334 --> 00:34:05,169
No, thanks.

249
00:34:05,253 --> 00:34:09,424
- Gets cold fast.
- I'm fine. Thanks.

250
00:34:12,009 --> 00:34:14,178
You suit yourself.

251
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:55,136
- Ma'am, do you want me to...?
- Yes, please.

252
00:35:13,321 --> 00:35:14,321
Thank you.

253
00:35:26,501 --> 00:35:30,671
I know I misrepresented myself
as a member of your legal team,

254
00:35:30,755 --> 00:35:34,675
I apologise for that.

255
00:35:35,676 --> 00:35:38,346
I wouldn't be here right now
if I didn't absolutely have to be.

256
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:49,273
I know who are.
Who you actually are.

257
00:35:49,357 --> 00:35:50,942
We have something in common.

258
00:35:51,025 --> 00:35:54,737
You wanna know where your money is,
I wanna find Saul Goodman.

259
00:35:54,821 --> 00:35:57,381
If you tell me where you sent him,
I won't alert the authorities,

260
00:35:57,406 --> 00:35:58,741
I won't tell anyone.

261
00:35:58,825 --> 00:36:02,495
I will find him and you'll get your money.

262
00:36:13,214 --> 00:36:14,590
Mr. Salamanca...

263
00:36:14,674 --> 00:36:17,802
Who the hell are you
that he tells you my business?

264
00:36:17,885 --> 00:36:20,388
He didn't betray your confidence.

265
00:36:20,471 --> 00:36:24,225
We're married,
which means I have spousal privilege.

266
00:36:24,308 --> 00:36:26,352
Anything he says to me stays with me.

267
00:36:26,435 --> 00:36:27,895
No one can make me discuss it.

268
00:36:27,979 --> 00:36:30,231
It's as bulletproof
as lawyer-client privilege.

269
00:36:31,232 --> 00:36:33,526
So you're his wife?

270
00:36:35,194 --> 00:36:36,529
Yes.

271
00:36:45,288 --> 00:36:51,168
So you're his wife and you love him,

272
00:36:51,252 --> 00:36:54,714
and he didn't come home last night,

273
00:36:54,797 --> 00:36:59,802
and you got scared enough
to come down here and talk to me.

274
00:37:02,346 --> 00:37:05,141
What makes you think
he didn't run off with my money, huh?

275
00:37:05,224 --> 00:37:07,435
He did not run off with your money.

276
00:37:07,518 --> 00:37:09,186
Yeah, maybe not.

277
00:37:10,187 --> 00:37:11,272
Not without you.

278
00:37:11,355 --> 00:37:14,400
Just tell me where you sent him.
That's all I need.

279
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:17,153
I don't think so.

280
00:37:18,154 --> 00:37:22,867
Your man, he's...
He's like la cucaracha, you know?

281
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:24,535
Born survivor.

282
00:37:24,619 --> 00:37:29,790
If trouble found him, give it a day.
If he's alive, he'll show.

283
00:37:29,874 --> 00:37:31,417
And if he's...?

284
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:35,212
Well, then a day's not gonna make
a difference, is it?

285
00:37:36,213 --> 00:37:41,010
All right. Well, nice to meet you,
Mrs. Goodman.

286
00:37:43,346 --> 00:37:46,766
Wait, Mr. Salamanca...

287
00:37:48,267 --> 00:37:50,102
Done!

288
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:33,813
Hey. I wouldn't waste that.

289
00:38:35,314 --> 00:38:36,983
Waste what?

290
00:38:38,567 --> 00:38:41,737
I don't have enough of this
for the both of us.

291
00:39:46,594 --> 00:39:50,890
<i>Just a lonely soul</i>

292
00:39:51,891 --> 00:39:55,978
<i>Slowly dying</i>

293
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:01,859
<i>I was smiling hard</i>

294
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:06,238
<i>But I was lying</i>

295
00:40:08,324 --> 00:40:12,787
<i>Then you sailed along</i>

296
00:40:13,788 --> 00:40:18,167
<i>With your sweet dream</i>

297
00:40:19,168 --> 00:40:23,714
<i>When you stole my heart</i>

298
00:40:24,715 --> 00:40:28,427
<i>I was livid</i>

299
00:40:31,138 --> 00:40:33,682
<i>Morning come</i>

300
00:40:33,766 --> 00:40:35,726
<i>Sun don't shine</i>

301
00:40:36,727 --> 00:40:40,940
<i>I'll get by without you</i>

302
00:40:41,941 --> 00:40:47,238
<i>I was lost, but now I'm found</i>

303
00:40:47,321 --> 00:40:51,075
<i>Tell me, love, it was you</i>

304
00:41:23,816 --> 00:41:24,942
More.

305
00:41:25,901 --> 00:41:27,361
- No.
- More.

306
00:41:27,444 --> 00:41:31,115
No. You want more...

307
00:41:38,914 --> 00:41:40,457
All right.

308
00:41:43,502 --> 00:41:46,422
Come on. Let's go.

309
00:41:57,641 --> 00:42:00,644
Hold it. I have an idea.

310
00:42:21,957 --> 00:42:25,002
- That's not gonna work.
- This is gonna work.

311
00:43:48,544 --> 00:43:49,962
You gonna get that?

312
00:43:50,963 --> 00:43:52,756
Get what?

313
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:03,058
Got it.

314
00:44:04,226 --> 00:44:06,186
Oh, crap.

315
00:44:50,564 --> 00:44:51,899
Hey. Shit!

316
00:45:04,745 --> 00:45:08,582
That's it. I'm done.

317
00:45:08,665 --> 00:45:09,666
Done!

318
00:45:11,043 --> 00:45:12,586
Done!

319
00:45:12,669 --> 00:45:14,213
Quiet.

320
00:45:14,296 --> 00:45:16,006
Why? I'm quiet, I'm loud,

321
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:17,970
I'm gonna die in this dirt
one way or the other.

322
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:19,802
Let's get it over with.

323
00:45:20,803 --> 00:45:22,179
- Get up.
- No.

324
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:24,848
I'm not going.

325
00:45:25,849 --> 00:45:27,935
I'm done.

326
00:45:28,018 --> 00:45:29,812
Everything hurts.

327
00:45:30,813 --> 00:45:33,649
God, I'm so thirsty.

328
00:45:33,732 --> 00:45:35,692
You need to drink.

329
00:45:35,776 --> 00:45:37,236
What's the point?

330
00:45:37,319 --> 00:45:39,780
So they can find a corpse
with a mouth full of piss?

331
00:45:39,863 --> 00:45:44,159
That's not gonna happen.
Now get up.

332
00:45:46,912 --> 00:45:48,580
Come on.

333
00:45:54,962 --> 00:45:58,465
Oh, God. Oh, no. How...?

334
00:45:59,466 --> 00:46:01,343
How the hell are you still going?

335
00:46:01,427 --> 00:46:05,556
Because I know why I'm out here.
That's how.

336
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:07,599
I know what it's for.

337
00:46:07,683 --> 00:46:11,353
And I can't drag that money
out of here by myself.

338
00:46:12,521 --> 00:46:18,527
So you...
You get up, and you get up now.

339
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:23,323
What it's for? What is it for?

340
00:46:27,828 --> 00:46:29,538
I have people.

341
00:46:30,539 --> 00:46:34,543
I have people waiting for me.

342
00:46:34,626 --> 00:46:37,421
They don't know what I do,
they never will.

343
00:46:38,422 --> 00:46:40,674
They're protected.

344
00:46:40,757 --> 00:46:44,428
But I do what I do
so they can have a better life.

345
00:46:44,511 --> 00:46:48,682
And if I live or if I die,
it really doesn't make a difference to me

346
00:46:48,765 --> 00:46:52,311
as long as they have what they need.

347
00:46:52,394 --> 00:46:54,688
So when it's my time to go,

348
00:46:54,771 --> 00:46:59,318
I will go knowing I did everything
I could for them.

349
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:04,948
Now, you ask me how I keep going?

350
00:47:06,742 --> 00:47:08,744
That's how.

351
00:47:21,089 --> 00:47:24,343
Stay down. He's back.

352
00:48:02,881 --> 00:48:04,633
Lie low.

353
00:48:04,716 --> 00:48:07,469
We're gonna have to wait him out.

354
00:48:45,799 --> 00:48:48,885
Hey, get that thing ready.

355
00:49:12,909 --> 00:49:15,495
Come on, you asshole.

356
00:49:15,579 --> 00:49:18,165
You want this 7 mil?

357
00:49:19,124 --> 00:49:21,918
Come on, I'm just walking here

358
00:49:22,002 --> 00:49:24,463
like a goddamn idiot!

359
00:49:38,727 --> 00:49:41,605
Come and get some, you dickhead.

360
00:49:47,069 --> 00:49:50,113
You son of a bitch. Look at me!

361
00:50:06,088 --> 00:50:09,966
Yeah, there you go.

362
00:50:33,615 --> 00:50:35,867
Come on. Come on.
