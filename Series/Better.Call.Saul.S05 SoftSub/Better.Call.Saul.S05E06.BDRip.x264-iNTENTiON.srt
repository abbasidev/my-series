1
00:01:05,734 --> 00:01:07,694
Hey, baby.

2
00:01:07,777 --> 00:01:09,237
- You ready?
- Where were you?

3
00:01:10,321 --> 00:01:12,615
- What?
- Where were you?

4
00:01:12,699 --> 00:01:15,285
I'm sorry, hon.
I got held up down at the Clover.

5
00:01:15,368 --> 00:01:17,287
Guess I kind of lost track of time.

6
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,997
You were drinking?

7
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,500
Kimmy. It was one beer.

8
00:01:22,584 --> 00:01:25,587
- Doesn't smell like one beer.
- Well, that's what it was.

9
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:28,965
So let's go. Get in.

10
00:01:29,966 --> 00:01:31,885
<i>It's an affair of the heart</i>

11
00:01:31,968 --> 00:01:35,054
Kim, I'm not doing this.
Come on. It's cold out.

12
00:01:35,138 --> 00:01:38,266
Let's go get some food, go home.

13
00:01:38,349 --> 00:01:42,270
Split a box of McNuggets,
see what's on TV.

14
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,816
I'm just gonna walk.

15
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:51,279
Really? You're gonna walk three miles
with a cello.

16
00:01:51,362 --> 00:01:54,157
Don't be stupid. Get in.

17
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:58,661
I'll let you choose the radio station.
Come on.

18
00:02:06,377 --> 00:02:10,924
Kim, get in the car right now.

19
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:15,053
I said it was one beer.
You're gonna be like this?

20
00:02:18,515 --> 00:02:19,849
You don't believe me?

21
00:02:21,851 --> 00:02:24,229
Kim, get in, or I'm driving home.

22
00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:26,272
Right now, in the car.

23
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:31,152
I mean it. I'm going.

24
00:02:33,488 --> 00:02:36,366
Fine. Don't listen to me.

25
00:02:37,367 --> 00:02:40,370
You never listen!

26
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:26,541
Freedom.

27
00:03:26,624 --> 00:03:28,626
Freedom to ride.

28
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:31,754
Freedom to explore.

29
00:03:31,838 --> 00:03:33,673
Freedom to bank...

30
00:03:34,674 --> 00:03:36,050
the way you want to.

31
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:42,265
Hi, I'm Don Wachtell,
president of Mesa Verde.

32
00:03:42,348 --> 00:03:46,019
For the past 10 years,
our family has taken pride

33
00:03:46,102 --> 00:03:50,648
in helping your family grow your savings
out here in the Southwest,

34
00:03:50,732 --> 00:03:52,942
with freedom from hidden fees,

35
00:03:53,026 --> 00:03:56,738
and freedom to choose the account
that's right for you.

36
00:03:56,821 --> 00:03:59,699
- Ain't that right, Kevin?
- That's right, Dad.

37
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:02,492
Yup!

38
00:04:03,328 --> 00:04:07,707
Let our family help find your freedom
at Mesa Verde.

39
00:04:20,136 --> 00:04:22,347
So can you do it?

40
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:25,808
The media lab has a Vision Mixer. I think
we can get the effect you're going for.

41
00:04:25,892 --> 00:04:29,896
And with makeup and costumes, we can
make it look like the same time period.

42
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:31,064
That's great.

43
00:04:31,147 --> 00:04:32,565
I love it.

44
00:04:32,649 --> 00:04:34,400
It's gonna sing.

45
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:39,364
I'm sensing that Schleprock here
is gonna puke on my parade.

46
00:04:39,447 --> 00:04:40,448
You want it when?

47
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:44,869
As soon as possible.
Tomorrow would be optimal.

48
00:04:46,162 --> 00:04:48,456
Let me break it down for you, chief.

49
00:04:49,457 --> 00:04:52,335
You got 10 spots.
I count 12, 13 locations.

50
00:04:52,418 --> 00:04:56,464
And then there's post, graphics,
this video-effects thing you're talking.

51
00:04:56,547 --> 00:04:59,676
That's a week, maybe more.

52
00:05:00,677 --> 00:05:03,513
Probably more. We have midterms.

53
00:05:03,596 --> 00:05:05,807
And plus, we have to lug
all our stuff around.

54
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:08,726
And actors, craft service...

55
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,979
You scout these locations?
I got a place to plug in?

56
00:05:11,062 --> 00:05:13,815
Oh, and bathrooms. People need bathrooms.
They literally...

57
00:05:13,898 --> 00:05:15,483
Whoa, just...

58
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:18,152
There's gotta be a way, right?
Because we're smart.

59
00:05:18,236 --> 00:05:21,280
So we can figure out a way, right?

60
00:05:23,032 --> 00:05:24,784
- Cut the number of spots.
- No.

61
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:30,415
It's... Shock and awe is what I'm going
for here. Anything less, no.

62
00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:33,334
What if you use voiceovers
instead of actors?

63
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:35,128
Or if we did in all in one location.

64
00:05:35,211 --> 00:05:39,257
So no actors, no scope, no impact.
No. Just...

65
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:43,219
I just feel like
if we just get out there and this...

66
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:45,847
We hustle. We can do it. We can.

67
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,932
Dude, can't be done.

68
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:54,439
- We can...
- Dude, we can't.

69
00:05:57,567 --> 00:06:00,194
I don't know.
What if we did the Superman thing?

70
00:06:01,946 --> 00:06:03,990
A what?

71
00:06:04,657 --> 00:06:06,701
You know, like Superman. Like...

72
00:06:06,784 --> 00:06:10,413
Well, like a weatherman.
Blue screen, I think.

73
00:06:11,456 --> 00:06:13,207
Do you mean a green screen?

74
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:16,210
Whatever. Blue, green, just...

75
00:06:16,294 --> 00:06:17,962
Can we do that?

76
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,048
You got a green screen?

77
00:06:28,264 --> 00:06:30,266
Looking good, gentlemen.

78
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:32,769
- Red leather, yellow leather.
- What?

79
00:06:32,852 --> 00:06:36,522
- Red leather, yellow leather.
- Very nice.

80
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:46,616
Mom makes meat.

81
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:49,077
- Mom makes meat.
- Red leather, yellow leather.

82
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,789
Red leather, red... Yellow. Yellow leather.

83
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,832
We're ready ready.

84
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:58,461
Everyone, a lot to do,
no time to do it.

85
00:06:58,544 --> 00:07:01,839
- Who knows their lines?
- Yes, I believe I have it.

86
00:07:01,923 --> 00:07:03,466
I love a man of confidence.

87
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:07,762
I played Prospero on the plaza
a month after prostate surgery.

88
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:11,099
- One has to have confidence.
- Wonderful. God bless.

89
00:07:11,182 --> 00:07:14,393
Now bring that confidence
right over here to this mark on the floor.

90
00:07:14,477 --> 00:07:19,023
That's your spot.
Do not move from it. Okay?

91
00:07:19,107 --> 00:07:22,235
But also, don't be rigid, okay?
Try to be natural.

92
00:07:22,318 --> 00:07:24,445
And speak to me.

93
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:29,283
You know, conversational,
everyday, like a friend. But...

94
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,411
There's fear here, there's emotion.

95
00:07:32,495 --> 00:07:35,123
You're searching for a hero, you know?

96
00:07:35,206 --> 00:07:37,750
Will no one save you?

97
00:07:37,834 --> 00:07:42,588
But don't hit it too hard.
Just throw it away, but with feeling.

98
00:07:42,672 --> 00:07:43,965
Okay? Good. How we doing?

99
00:07:44,048 --> 00:07:45,591
- Let's shoot this mother.
- All right.

100
00:07:45,675 --> 00:07:49,220
There's cue cards if you need them.

101
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:51,681
But don't look at them, look at me, okay?

102
00:07:51,764 --> 00:07:52,890
But you know, they're there.

103
00:07:52,974 --> 00:07:55,226
- So roll sound.
- Rolling.

104
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:56,352
- Camera?
- Speed.

105
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:59,063
And action.

106
00:07:59,147 --> 00:08:01,858
This is great. Stand right there.
You look great.

107
00:08:01,941 --> 00:08:03,276
Eyes open.

108
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:07,947
Yeah, good. Good. Can I drop your jaw?
Sideways, a little?

109
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,910
- Perfect. That's it. Press record.
- I can't...

110
00:08:09,991 --> 00:08:13,494
- And five, four, three, two, magic.
- Magic.

111
00:08:13,578 --> 00:08:15,830
- Delicious.
- Can't have pizza while we do the thing.

112
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:18,833
We're trying to shoot the commercial,
that's why. I'll keep it here.

113
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:22,670
Look up this way. Right?
And then stay right like that.

114
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:24,672
All right. Show it to me. Boom.

115
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:29,302
You're a cool guy, okay? But not too cool.
I need you to be relatable.

116
00:08:29,385 --> 00:08:31,637
Give me that Fonz. All right. Good.

117
00:08:31,721 --> 00:08:33,931
Put it down. Nobody's buying it.

118
00:08:34,015 --> 00:08:36,767
Okay. The cane, I think,
is a little too much. Can I have it?

119
00:08:36,851 --> 00:08:40,605
And five, four, three, two, magic.

120
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:43,566
- What?
- Leave it. Let go. Just really... Okay?

121
00:08:45,902 --> 00:08:49,030
You look very, very officious, okay?

122
00:08:49,113 --> 00:08:52,116
All right. Can you smile warmly? No?

123
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,201
I'm trying to direct.

124
00:08:53,284 --> 00:08:55,536
- Good. Get out of the way. Out of the way.
- Okay.

125
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,831
And acting.

126
00:08:58,915 --> 00:09:00,833
Cool. All right. Do that.
Ready? Yeah.

127
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:02,460
Yeah, like this.

128
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:04,795
Too much... Put your hand right...
Yeah, yeah.

129
00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:08,925
Stand on the X. This is great.

130
00:09:09,008 --> 00:09:10,092
Smile.

131
00:09:10,176 --> 00:09:14,388
Turn sideways.
Take your coke out of her hand.

132
00:09:14,472 --> 00:09:17,225
And now, look sad. Glum.

133
00:09:18,351 --> 00:09:21,687
And then when I say, action,
you look here. No, faster.

134
00:09:21,771 --> 00:09:25,566
Make it a whip. Whip your head.
Up here and then go. Action.

135
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:27,777
Look back. Okay. Anyone else?

136
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:31,697
So that they don't reflect, okay?
That looks normal. Look right in.

137
00:09:31,781 --> 00:09:34,659
Look at me. Point.

138
00:09:34,742 --> 00:09:36,494
No. Like this.

139
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:40,456
More. More.

140
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,168
Good. Make it look real.

141
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:47,922
And cut.

142
00:09:48,965 --> 00:09:50,216
Beautiful.

143
00:10:16,242 --> 00:10:18,661
I'm Saul Goodman. If you...

144
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:37,013
Just hold on. Hold on.

145
00:10:38,264 --> 00:10:41,475
You came. I'm sorry, you missed
most of it. I'm almost through my part.

146
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:44,854
Now, you coming in? Because, hey,
we still got a slice or two of pizza left.

147
00:10:44,937 --> 00:10:46,397
No. I ate at the office. I'm good.

148
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,151
Are you sure? Because it's cold pizza
fondled by community theatre actors.

149
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:51,986
You're gonna pass on that?

150
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:55,448
Yeah, I think I will pass.
I just wanted to talk.

151
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:57,700
Talk? Yeah, sure.

152
00:10:57,783 --> 00:11:00,578
Of course. Five.

153
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:05,750
Good news. I tracked down
Olivia Bitsui. She is 92 years young.

154
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:09,003
She's part of the Navajo Nation.
She lives out by Window Rock.

155
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:10,886
I'm gonna call her first thing
in the morning.

156
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:12,465
Hopefully have a face-to-face.

157
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:14,550
- Jimmy...
- I'm gonna bring a floral arrangement,

158
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:17,178
or maybe a cake assortment
from Brother's Bakery?

159
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:20,639
- Good idea...
- Jimmy. Do you think...?

160
00:11:22,183 --> 00:11:26,187
Will Acker settle for 75,000?

161
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:29,440
- Seventy-five?
- Yeah. Will he go for it?

162
00:11:30,441 --> 00:11:34,153
Are you saying that Kevin is willing
to go up to 75 on this?

163
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:35,236
I...

164
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:40,284
Look, we'll negotiate as far up as we can,
and then I'll make up the difference.

165
00:11:40,368 --> 00:11:42,078
Okay, hold on.

166
00:11:42,161 --> 00:11:43,412
You'll make up the difference,

167
00:11:43,496 --> 00:11:45,664
as in, out-of-your-own-pocket
make up the difference?

168
00:11:45,748 --> 00:11:46,748
I... Yes.

169
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:50,211
I just need to end this now and move on.

170
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:53,464
But why? No. Hey, we have him.

171
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:55,674
Rich is suspicious.

172
00:11:55,758 --> 00:11:58,219
He said some things.

173
00:11:58,302 --> 00:12:00,638
He's second-guessing
how you got to be Acker's lawyer

174
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:02,556
and questioning my intentions.

175
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,016
Enough to want me off the case.

176
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,644
We move forward with this,
Rich figures out what's happening.

177
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:09,271
Here's the truth. Rich knows nothing.

178
00:12:09,355 --> 00:12:11,065
- Well, not yet. No.
- Not ever.

179
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:16,028
He has nothing.
There is no way to prove anything.

180
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,575
You may be right.

181
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:27,415
But it's just not worth it.

182
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:31,293
But what about the play here?

183
00:12:31,377 --> 00:12:34,088
The play is beautiful.

184
00:12:35,214 --> 00:12:41,303
God, this is like watching
a walk-off home run just drift foul.

185
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:50,396
It's your play.
If you wanna walk, we'll walk.

186
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:58,028
So I gotta break it to the kids.

187
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:04,410
Well, there's a lot to clean up before
Mrs. Nguyen can open in the morning, so...

188
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:07,204
- I'll help.
- No. You've been all day at work.

189
00:13:07,288 --> 00:13:10,374
Jimmy, you're out here doing all this
because of me. I'm helping.

190
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:11,959
Yeah.

191
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:17,673
All right. Just don't touch the camera.
He claims it's an extension of his body.

192
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:20,342
Noted.

193
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:26,909
You're Michael?

194
00:14:27,952 --> 00:14:31,330
The gringo Lalo
had a bug up his ass about?

195
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:33,975
If Hector or the cousins
ever find out about...

196
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:36,835
They're not gonna find out.

197
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:39,922
Get on with it.

198
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:45,177
Lalo's using his C.I. connection.

199
00:14:45,261 --> 00:14:48,806
He's having Domingo call the DEA
to rat out your dealers.

200
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:52,142
Times they're slinging, locations.

201
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:55,688
Your guys are gonna get swept up.

202
00:14:59,275 --> 00:15:01,277
Promote low-level dealers.

203
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,238
Or find new ones.

204
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:06,115
Let them get arrested.

205
00:15:07,116 --> 00:15:10,035
Protect our people.

206
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:12,371
- You got it.
- What else?

207
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:15,332
He talks about a lot of things.

208
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:21,338
Hitting your supply trucks,
going after your restaurants.

209
00:15:21,422 --> 00:15:23,299
Getting your customers sick.

210
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:25,926
Cutting off power, busting open pipes.

211
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,595
He's gonna chip away at your business

212
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:31,223
until the bosses down south don't think
you're worth the trouble.

213
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:42,067
From now on, you report to this man.

214
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:47,990
He needs you, you do not hesitate.

215
00:15:49,575 --> 00:15:51,327
Act.

216
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:17,394
Guessing there's something
you wanna get off your chest.

217
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:26,236
You know who you're working for, right?

218
00:16:28,864 --> 00:16:32,326
The shit that this guy does.

219
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:36,038
They shot me.

220
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:40,042
Left me bleeding out in the desert,
all part of some plan.

221
00:16:41,085 --> 00:16:45,005
I don't know what to tell you.
I warned you.

222
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:47,966
- What?
- I warned you,

223
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,469
when you started going
after Hector Salamanca,

224
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:52,554
there'd be others to worry about.

225
00:16:52,638 --> 00:16:53,972
You made a choice.

226
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:57,434
You got in with both eyes open.

227
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:00,437
My father didn't.

228
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:05,859
He's got a gun to my father's head.

229
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:11,782
I don't do what he says...

230
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:15,619
Look, first things first.

231
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,164
We take care of Lalo.

232
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:24,336
Then we'll talk.

233
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:38,183
Paige, you've got Kim, Rich and Marcie.

234
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:40,477
Guys,
I hope you're calling with good news.

235
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:43,480
- You sitting down?
- Oh, God. Really?

236
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:45,357
Yep. Acker's decided to settle.

237
00:17:45,441 --> 00:17:48,193
Tell Kevin he's got his call centre.

238
00:17:48,277 --> 00:17:52,531
Fantastic. Kevin will be over the moon.
When is it official?

239
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:55,951
There's a meeting on the books
with Mr. Goodman for Wednesday at 3:00.

240
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:57,661
Music to my ears.

241
00:17:57,745 --> 00:18:00,497
Kevin's gonna wanna be there
to close this out and celebrate.

242
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:01,581
I can't wait.

243
00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:04,710
- Congrats, Paige.
- Congrats to you guys.

244
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:08,964
Kim, this was another tough one,
but you did it again.

245
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:12,092
Team effort.
We'll e-mail you the details.

246
00:18:12,176 --> 00:18:14,219
Great. Talk soon.

247
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,180
Okay.

248
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:20,392
Well, now that that's behind us
and I have you here,

249
00:18:20,476 --> 00:18:22,186
I wanna talk to Jason in Charlotte,

250
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:24,605
walk us through
these Fannie and Freddie changes.

251
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:27,691
Dorothy,
can you set up that North Carolina call?

252
00:18:27,775 --> 00:18:31,695
Actually, before we do that...
Sorry, Marcie, would you give us a minute?

253
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:33,572
Sure. Absolutely.

254
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:37,493
Dorothy, hold off on that call, please.
Thanks.

255
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:42,080
I...

256
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,042
I wanted to talk about yesterday.

257
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:48,337
Rich, you've been nothing
but generous to me,

258
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,923
and you don't deserve to be yelled at.

259
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:52,591
It was unprofessional.

260
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,803
I believe me staying on the case
was the right thing,

261
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:58,764
but that was the wrong way to react.

262
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,310
That's it.

263
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:06,063
Just that I'm sorry.

264
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:11,860
Kim,

265
00:19:12,903 --> 00:19:15,656
you have a bone to pick with me,
pick away.

266
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:18,575
In fact, you wanna lose your shit,
that's all right too.

267
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:21,328
I'm not perfect.
I've broken plenty of times.

268
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:24,540
But never in front of the troops.

269
00:19:24,623 --> 00:19:28,085
I don't have to spell out
what it does for morale, confidence.

270
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:29,837
Never again.

271
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:39,304
Hi. Yeah. No, let's punt the call
to Charlotte to another time.

272
00:19:39,388 --> 00:19:43,642
Also, cancel my 12:30,
but keep the reservation.

273
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:46,770
Yeah, that's right. Thanks.

274
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:51,233
You and me,

275
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:53,402
we're going to lunch.

276
00:19:53,485 --> 00:19:55,988
And everyone is gonna see us.

277
00:19:56,989 --> 00:19:57,989
Good?

278
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:02,828
- Good.
- All right, then. After you.

279
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:48,248
- Hi.
- Hi.

280
00:20:48,332 --> 00:20:50,167
Excuse me.

281
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,670
- Are these really only a quarter each?
- That's right.

282
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:56,506
Why so cheap? Is there
some kind of damage I'm not seeing?

283
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:59,468
No. We get lots of donations,
books we already have,

284
00:20:59,551 --> 00:21:01,345
and there's not enough room
on the shelves,

285
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:04,139
so we sell what we can,
to pay for newer releases.

286
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:07,601
Wow, I mean, you're kidding me.

287
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:09,478
Treasure Island.

288
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,814
Yeah.

289
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:15,901
And The Little Prince.

290
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:19,363
My granddaughter's gonna love these.

291
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:24,743
All right. Well, I will start with eight.

292
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:28,538
- All right. Eight. That's $2.
- Yes, ma'am.

293
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:37,089
- Thank you. Do you need a bag?
- No, I'm fine. Thank you.

294
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:38,757
And may I ask...

295
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:44,012
- Is there a Lillian Simmons working here?
- Yes, I'm Lily.

296
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:46,515
Lily. Great.

297
00:21:46,598 --> 00:21:48,350
My name's Dave Clark.

298
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:50,978
I'm a private investigator.

299
00:21:51,979 --> 00:21:55,065
- Is this about Travel Wire?
- That's right.

300
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:57,734
I already told the police
everything I saw, which wasn't much.

301
00:21:57,818 --> 00:22:01,446
You saw a man with a moustache,
dark hair, kind of tall.

302
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:02,948
I'm not even sure anymore.

303
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:06,702
It was through two sets of glass,
and he was leaning over a desk.

304
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:12,374
Are you free to sit and talk somewhere?
See if you remember any other details?

305
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:16,003
As I said, I told the police
everything I could remember.

306
00:22:16,086 --> 00:22:17,254
Oh, I know.

307
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:19,756
And the police are doing their best
with that information.

308
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,968
But I've been hired by the family.

309
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:27,222
And I am trying to help them find...

310
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:32,144
They're looking for closure, Lily.

311
00:22:33,145 --> 00:22:34,980
Anything to bring them peace.

312
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:40,819
I send money back to my parents
back in Taiwan.

313
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:42,654
I do it every month.

314
00:22:42,738 --> 00:22:44,573
Fred was always there.

315
00:22:44,656 --> 00:22:47,451
We didn't really talk much.
But he was efficient.

316
00:22:47,534 --> 00:22:51,204
So you see that man inside
on the day in question?

317
00:22:51,288 --> 00:22:56,084
That's right. The door sign
was flipped closed, which it never was,

318
00:22:56,168 --> 00:22:59,546
and then the man pointed at the sign
and waved me off.

319
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:02,632
I don't know, I thought they were having
internet problems or something.

320
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:05,093
I came back 20 minutes later...

321
00:23:05,177 --> 00:23:09,139
Oh, it was horrible.
Thick black smoke and flames.

322
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:13,560
And the man with the moustache,
you didn't see him when you returned?

323
00:23:13,643 --> 00:23:16,897
No. I got there
just as the fire engines were arriving.

324
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,149
Well, let's talk about
when you first got there.

325
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:20,609
You drove, I assume.

326
00:23:20,692 --> 00:23:22,736
- Yes.
- Where'd you park?

327
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:25,655
Right out front,
just to the right of the entrance.

328
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:29,659
- Were there any other cars parked there?
- A few.

329
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:30,911
The normal amount.

330
00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:35,499
- Any unusual or unique cars?
- Unusual?

331
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:39,461
Older cars, classic cars.
Something you might not see every day.

332
00:23:43,507 --> 00:23:45,592
Actually, I think there was.

333
00:23:45,675 --> 00:23:47,761
Do you remember what kind?

334
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:51,014
Oh, I don't really know cars.

335
00:23:51,098 --> 00:23:53,767
It had four wheels.

336
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:56,353
Okay.

337
00:24:00,107 --> 00:24:01,149
That look familiar?

338
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:16,581
Is this the car?

339
00:24:16,665 --> 00:24:19,543
That's not for me to say.

340
00:24:33,849 --> 00:24:35,851
Yes. Now that I look at it...

341
00:24:35,934 --> 00:24:38,562
Yes.
That was the type of car it was.

342
00:24:38,645 --> 00:24:41,815
A customised 1970 Monte Carlo?

343
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:43,567
Okay.

344
00:24:44,568 --> 00:24:47,279
And that is a huge help, Lily.

345
00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:49,573
Thank you very much.

346
00:24:49,656 --> 00:24:52,117
Oh, good.
Anything for that poor family.

347
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,828
- There is something else.
- Yes?

348
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:58,165
If you were able to call the detectives
who interviewed you

349
00:24:58,248 --> 00:25:03,378
and pass this along firsthand,
tell them that you remember that detail.

350
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:06,131
That was so long ago.

351
00:25:06,214 --> 00:25:08,633
I don't think I can remember
who I spoke to.

352
00:25:08,717 --> 00:25:11,887
Well, I have that right here.

353
00:25:14,222 --> 00:25:19,728
Detective Tim Roberts. That's his number.
Probably catch him at his desk right now.

354
00:25:22,105 --> 00:25:24,900
Oh, okay.

355
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:30,071
A grey 1970 Chevrolet Monte Carlo.

356
00:25:30,155 --> 00:25:31,364
Grey?

357
00:25:31,448 --> 00:25:33,950
And if you don't mind,
don't mention my name.

358
00:25:34,034 --> 00:25:35,327
Police get a little funny

359
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:38,872
about private investigators
horning in on their business.

360
00:25:38,955 --> 00:25:40,749
They can have all the credit.

361
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,627
I only want justice.

362
00:25:44,294 --> 00:25:47,881
Absolutely. I understand.

363
00:25:49,341 --> 00:25:51,384
Thank you, Lily.

364
00:25:58,892 --> 00:26:01,603
Count your lucky stars
we got Judge Papadoumian.

365
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:02,687
She likes my flair.

366
00:26:02,771 --> 00:26:06,274
Baby, you went the extra mile
for us today. Don't think I didn't notice.

367
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:09,945
Hey, you want a quick rub-n-tug,
just to say thanks?

368
00:26:10,946 --> 00:26:14,699
We won't mess up your suit or nothing.
We'll clean you up nice with a warm towel.

369
00:26:14,783 --> 00:26:17,327
A warm towel? I appreciate the offer,

370
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:20,580
but I'm gonna politely decline,
if that's okay.

371
00:26:20,664 --> 00:26:21,664
Raincheck.

372
00:26:21,706 --> 00:26:25,293
Well, we gotta get back to it anyway.
Almost lunchtime.

373
00:26:25,377 --> 00:26:30,924
Oh, hey, do you two think, maybe...
Maybe you should take a break.

374
00:26:31,007 --> 00:26:33,760
You don't see restaurants
closing doors at noon, do you?

375
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:34,844
Lunch is peak traffic.

376
00:26:34,928 --> 00:26:39,140
Just be careful, all right?
And try not to get picked up again. Okay?

377
00:26:39,224 --> 00:26:40,558
Yeah.

378
00:26:53,488 --> 00:26:56,616
Ladies, hey! Ladies.

379
00:26:58,451 --> 00:27:03,123
Hey, how much for an hour of your time?

380
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:10,672
Excuse me. Judge Greene?

381
00:27:10,755 --> 00:27:13,591
I keep hearing the news.
A hole-in-one at Sandia?

382
00:27:13,675 --> 00:27:15,051
I don't wanna say it was all luck.

383
00:27:15,135 --> 00:27:18,805
Then don't say another word.
U.S. Open, here we come.

384
00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:24,853
- Cliff. Been waiting long?
- Not at all. You're right on time.

385
00:27:24,936 --> 00:27:26,938
Thank you, Francisco.

386
00:27:27,022 --> 00:27:29,941
Saw you shaking hands
with Judge Greene.

387
00:27:30,025 --> 00:27:32,152
I don't know if you heard
about his retiring.

388
00:27:32,235 --> 00:27:33,611
No. Retiring?

389
00:27:33,695 --> 00:27:37,115
Yup.
Retiring with his 22-year-old law clerk.

390
00:27:37,198 --> 00:27:40,410
Really?

391
00:27:41,411 --> 00:27:43,455
Guess she's been filing
a different type of brief

392
00:27:43,538 --> 00:27:44,748
for the judge now, hasn't she?

393
00:27:44,831 --> 00:27:48,168
Very good.
Let's hear more about that hole-in-one.

394
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:51,880
Gentlemen.
Can I round up some drinks for the table?

395
00:27:51,963 --> 00:27:55,008
Absolutely. More time with the menu,
or you ready to pull the trigger?

396
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:56,801
Let's do it.

397
00:28:06,353 --> 00:28:08,772
I hear S&C are following the playbook.

398
00:28:08,855 --> 00:28:11,733
Erin and the gang already had a jump
on redrafting the complaint,

399
00:28:11,816 --> 00:28:14,069
then another box of receipts
were suddenly discovered.

400
00:28:14,152 --> 00:28:16,571
What are you hearing from Kiley?

401
00:28:20,283 --> 00:28:22,035
Can I help you?

402
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:24,954
Howie. You know.

403
00:28:26,373 --> 00:28:28,958
I... No. I don't know.

404
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:30,835
Oh, don't try to play us like that,
Howie.

405
00:28:32,837 --> 00:28:35,507
This is... I don't know them.

406
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:38,134
Ladies, I don't know you.
This is some sort of mistake, so...

407
00:28:38,218 --> 00:28:42,138
Yeah, we made a mistake, all right.
Joe Dog ain't happy.

408
00:28:42,222 --> 00:28:43,598
You owe us.

409
00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:46,267
- Owe you?
- Yeah. Owe.

410
00:28:46,351 --> 00:28:48,071
You can't take a ride
on the Carnival Cruise

411
00:28:48,144 --> 00:28:50,605
and only pay for a tugboat,
you know what I'm saying?

412
00:28:50,688 --> 00:28:53,858
- I can leave, if you need...
- No, no.

413
00:28:53,942 --> 00:28:59,114
Look, I don't know any Joe Dog
or tugboat.

414
00:28:59,197 --> 00:29:00,573
So we can end this right now.

415
00:29:00,657 --> 00:29:03,201
We ain't leaving
without our cash money, honey.

416
00:29:04,245 --> 00:29:07,205
I don't know you
and owe no money to you.

417
00:29:07,288 --> 00:29:08,498
- That's it.
- Don't touch her!

418
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:09,581
I didn't...

419
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:14,712
No, Cliff, these are not
my hookers. They're somebody else's.

420
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:18,466
Howard, are you sure
they're not your hookers? They seem to be.

421
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:23,596
No, no, Cliff. My hookers
were taller than these.

422
00:29:24,973 --> 00:29:27,350
Oh, God, I'm good.

423
00:29:53,084 --> 00:29:56,087
Hello. Olivia Bitsui?

424
00:29:57,088 --> 00:30:00,008
Yes. Good afternoon, ma'am.
My name is Saul Goodman.

425
00:30:00,091 --> 00:30:03,845
I'm an attorney
based in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

426
00:30:03,928 --> 00:30:06,514
Yes. Yes, I'm a lawyer.

427
00:30:08,349 --> 00:30:10,727
Well, I wanted to ask you,

428
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:15,356
have you ever heard
of a bank called Mesa Verde?

429
00:30:37,462 --> 00:30:39,005
You.

430
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:42,674
What's that?

431
00:30:43,551 --> 00:30:44,594
Sorry?

432
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:49,390
That. How long has it been down there?

433
00:30:52,685 --> 00:30:55,271
I don't know.

434
00:30:55,355 --> 00:30:59,317
It's an interoffice envelope.
Isn't there a date?

435
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,361
Yes. Today.

436
00:31:01,444 --> 00:31:05,323
Today.
And where is it supposed to be today?

437
00:31:06,866 --> 00:31:07,951
Detective Roberts.

438
00:31:08,034 --> 00:31:12,330
And don't you think
that Detective Roberts should get it

439
00:31:12,413 --> 00:31:14,791
sometime today?

440
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:18,795
Yes. Absolutely. Sorry, sir.

441
00:31:25,134 --> 00:31:31,641
If the smell is coming from under
your porch, it is most likely a possum.

442
00:31:32,642 --> 00:31:35,603
That's right. A possum.

443
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:40,525
If it's a human body,
yes, I'll investigate.

444
00:31:41,526 --> 00:31:44,571
But you need to call animal control first.

445
00:31:45,572 --> 00:31:48,241
Yes, I'm sure.

446
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:53,705
You can also shine a flashlight
under the porch

447
00:31:53,788 --> 00:31:56,124
and see what's under there yourself.

448
00:31:56,207 --> 00:31:57,709
Well...

449
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:01,170
if the porch isn't big enough
for you to get under,

450
00:32:01,254 --> 00:32:04,841
then there's probably not a dead body.
Okay?

451
00:32:05,842 --> 00:32:09,554
Yes, sir. You have a good day.

452
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:20,356
Ed. You need to put eyes on this.

453
00:32:23,818 --> 00:32:25,194
Hit-and-run.

454
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:28,197
Same day as our Travel Wire murder.

455
00:32:28,281 --> 00:32:30,241
Check out the make of the car.

456
00:32:30,325 --> 00:32:32,994
1970 Chevrolet Monte Carlo.

457
00:32:33,077 --> 00:32:36,706
Same model our librarian just called in.
What are the odds?

458
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:40,376
Who sent this? Officer McFloss?
I can't even read that.

459
00:32:42,837 --> 00:32:46,883
The guy rammed his car
right through a parking gate?

460
00:32:46,966 --> 00:32:52,263
So we got a Monte Carlo at a lot here,
half hour before the murder.

461
00:32:52,347 --> 00:32:56,643
Leaves the scene of the hit-and-run,
headed east towards Travel Wire.

462
00:32:56,726 --> 00:32:58,353
Twenty blocks.

463
00:32:59,354 --> 00:33:01,814
This is sounding like our guy.

464
00:33:05,526 --> 00:33:07,487
James usually run late?

465
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:09,280
He'll be here.

466
00:33:11,074 --> 00:33:14,077
All I care about
is getting this behind us.

467
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,163
Done. Finito.

468
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:20,917
We won't have finalised contracts today,
but we'll definitely land on an agreement.

469
00:33:30,468 --> 00:33:31,636
Hello, folks.

470
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:34,889
Nice to see lots and lots of happy faces,

471
00:33:34,972 --> 00:33:38,059
and you too, Rich. Kidding.

472
00:33:38,142 --> 00:33:40,144
- Jimmy. Always a pleasure.
- Saul.

473
00:33:40,228 --> 00:33:42,855
Saul Goodman during business hours,
s'all the time.

474
00:33:42,939 --> 00:33:45,441
This is Paige Novick,
Mesa Verde's in-house counsel.

475
00:33:45,525 --> 00:33:46,483
Nice to meet you.

476
00:33:46,484 --> 00:33:49,654
Paige. I know you're the one
who brought Kim Wexler onto the team,

477
00:33:49,737 --> 00:33:51,864
so I consider you the brains
of the operation.

478
00:33:51,948 --> 00:33:53,449
I actually think you're right.

479
00:33:53,533 --> 00:33:56,035
And this is Kevin Wachtell,
CEO of Mesa Verde.

480
00:33:56,119 --> 00:34:01,582
Oh, you know what? I could tell
from the impressive belt buckle.

481
00:34:01,666 --> 00:34:03,209
Looking forward to settling this.

482
00:34:03,292 --> 00:34:05,002
Me too. Let's do this.

483
00:34:07,714 --> 00:34:09,966
Hey, Viola. How's it hanging?

484
00:34:10,049 --> 00:34:12,301
- I... Good.
- Cool.

485
00:34:13,428 --> 00:34:15,304
- Just to jump into it...
- Jump away.

486
00:34:16,931 --> 00:34:21,310
As discussed, considering we're only
contractually obligated to pay 5000

487
00:34:21,394 --> 00:34:23,813
on top of fair market value
for Mr. Acker's home,

488
00:34:23,896 --> 00:34:26,899
we believe 45,000 is more than generous.

489
00:34:26,983 --> 00:34:27,984
I hear that,

490
00:34:28,067 --> 00:34:32,196
but you and I have a different definition
of the word generous.

491
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,365
Because that's not
how I would describe it.

492
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:36,534
And here we go.

493
00:34:36,617 --> 00:34:39,495
We're not prepared to offer more
than what's on the table.

494
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:42,999
No, no, I knew there would be dickering,
so let's just...

495
00:34:43,082 --> 00:34:44,882
Let's just hear the number
you're looking for,

496
00:34:44,959 --> 00:34:47,044
so we can all move forward with our lives.

497
00:34:47,128 --> 00:34:48,838
We'd like nothing more.

498
00:34:49,964 --> 00:34:52,341
What amount are you asking?

499
00:34:52,425 --> 00:34:54,051
Four million dollars.

500
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:57,930
Four million. Very funny. Very funny.

501
00:34:58,014 --> 00:35:01,142
Mr. Acker would like to be paid
4 million dollars

502
00:35:01,225 --> 00:35:03,144
for his pain and suffering.

503
00:35:03,227 --> 00:35:05,855
- It's what's fair.
- What in the world are you talking about?

504
00:35:05,938 --> 00:35:10,401
Well, it's a four with six zeroes,
and it's preceded by a dollar sign.

505
00:35:11,402 --> 00:35:13,821
- We had an agreement.
- We had a discussion.

506
00:35:13,905 --> 00:35:18,326
We had a verbal agreement on a number
that both sides would be happy with.

507
00:35:18,409 --> 00:35:20,870
And I discussed the offer with my client,

508
00:35:20,953 --> 00:35:25,500
and he really, really doesn't wanna leave
his house, his home.

509
00:35:25,583 --> 00:35:29,587
Four million is the only number
he'll be happy with.

510
00:35:33,674 --> 00:35:35,009
I apologise.

511
00:35:35,092 --> 00:35:36,385
We need to end this meeting now

512
00:35:36,469 --> 00:35:40,264
so Rich and I can have a conversation
with Mr. Goodman.

513
00:35:41,474 --> 00:35:44,185
Just incredible nerve.

514
00:35:44,268 --> 00:35:45,853
Ridiculous.

515
00:35:45,937 --> 00:35:48,815
What's your endgame here?
You know you'll never get that money.

516
00:35:48,898 --> 00:35:51,442
- Wait, don't leave.
- You're not wasting more of their time.

517
00:35:51,526 --> 00:35:53,194
- No...
- Kevin, meeting's over.

518
00:35:53,277 --> 00:35:55,238
Not while the gang's all here.

519
00:35:55,321 --> 00:35:57,949
I would love to bring up
a completely unrelated matter.

520
00:35:58,032 --> 00:36:01,118
- Kevin, we can handle this.
- No, this is really good.

521
00:36:01,202 --> 00:36:04,956
You're gonna wanna see this.
Kevin, stick around. Your dad's in this.

522
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:06,123
What?

523
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:08,793
Kevin, I insist.
This is a waste of your time.

524
00:36:08,876 --> 00:36:10,545
There's only one way to find out.

525
00:36:10,628 --> 00:36:12,755
Kevin, I'm advising you
to please keep walking.

526
00:36:17,468 --> 00:36:19,804
No. I wanna see this.

527
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:25,142
Viola, you mind getting the shades?

528
00:36:26,394 --> 00:36:29,313
Viola? Shades, please.

529
00:36:44,328 --> 00:36:46,247
Here we go.

530
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:56,924
I'm Don Wachtell.

531
00:36:57,008 --> 00:36:59,719
President of Mesa Verde.

532
00:36:59,802 --> 00:37:02,471
My bank took my home over a technicality.

533
00:37:02,555 --> 00:37:06,893
And I never missed a single payment.
It's not right. It's un-American.

534
00:37:06,976 --> 00:37:08,644
Yup!

535
00:37:08,728 --> 00:37:10,229
Hi, I'm Saul Goodman.

536
00:37:10,313 --> 00:37:11,564
Have you or a family member

537
00:37:11,647 --> 00:37:14,150
been wrongfully evicted
from your home by Mesa Verde?

538
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:16,986
Then you may be entitled
to a large cash settlement.

539
00:37:17,069 --> 00:37:20,489
Call 505-503-4455 today!

540
00:37:20,573 --> 00:37:22,617
- Are you kidding me?
- None of that is true.

541
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,177
- Libel. It's libel.
- Defamation.

542
00:37:24,201 --> 00:37:26,287
That's my father you're making a fool of.

543
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:29,707
- Turn it off. You know you can't do this.
- This is a good one.

544
00:37:30,708 --> 00:37:36,213
I went into my bank to withdraw cash
for groceries, and I came out with a rash.

545
00:37:36,297 --> 00:37:38,591
I can't stop itching. It's everywhere.

546
00:37:38,674 --> 00:37:40,217
Yup!

547
00:37:40,301 --> 00:37:41,928
Hi, I'm Saul Goodman.

548
00:37:42,011 --> 00:37:44,305
Did you or a family member visit
a Mesa Verde branch

549
00:37:44,388 --> 00:37:46,474
and come into contact with black mould?

550
00:37:46,557 --> 00:37:48,100
Then you may be entitled to a...

551
00:37:48,184 --> 00:37:50,937
There's no way in hell
you can legally run these.

552
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,189
Maybe.

553
00:37:53,272 --> 00:37:57,526
But, you know, we'll fight it out after
they run in New Mexico, Arizona, Utah...

554
00:37:57,610 --> 00:38:00,029
No, no, we will stop it
before it ever gets that far.

555
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:02,114
Some might call that prior restraint.

556
00:38:02,198 --> 00:38:04,200
You know what? You could stop us.

557
00:38:04,283 --> 00:38:07,578
Some news outlet will pick it up,
they'll run for free.

558
00:38:07,662 --> 00:38:09,705
To open my safety-deposit box,

559
00:38:09,789 --> 00:38:13,417
and Mr. **** was standing there
with his pants down.

560
00:38:13,501 --> 00:38:15,878
- Bare genitals.
- Yup!

561
00:38:15,962 --> 00:38:18,464
My dad never, ever did anything like that!

562
00:38:18,547 --> 00:38:20,841
None of this is true. This is all fantasy.

563
00:38:20,925 --> 00:38:24,428
Doesn't matter. This trash airs,
our reputation is in the toilet!

564
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,763
It'll never, ever get that far.

565
00:38:28,516 --> 00:38:31,936
I'm Don Wachtell.

566
00:38:32,019 --> 00:38:35,439
The bank manager couldn't explain
where all the extra fees were going.

567
00:38:35,523 --> 00:38:36,857
So I followed the money trail.

568
00:38:36,941 --> 00:38:40,736
The evidence was as clear as day.
My bank was funding terrorism.

569
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,422
- Yup!
- Just stop.

570
00:38:42,446 --> 00:38:44,281
- Stop it!
- Hi. I'm Saul Goodman...

571
00:38:44,365 --> 00:38:46,575
I've seen enough of this horseshit.
Jesus.

572
00:38:46,659 --> 00:38:48,285
There's lots more.

573
00:38:48,369 --> 00:38:51,664
You know, I can leave you this one,
because I've got plenty of copies.

574
00:38:51,747 --> 00:38:53,547
What do you hope to gain with all this?

575
00:38:53,582 --> 00:38:58,587
We agree to Acker's ridiculous demands
and you don't run this garbage?

576
00:38:58,671 --> 00:39:02,299
It's illegal to do that.
No lawyer can play one case off another.

577
00:39:02,383 --> 00:39:04,510
It is unethical, and it is blackmail.

578
00:39:04,593 --> 00:39:05,678
She's right.

579
00:39:05,761 --> 00:39:08,347
One has absolutely nothing to do
with the other.

580
00:39:08,431 --> 00:39:11,934
Which leads me to my next topic.

581
00:39:12,018 --> 00:39:16,522
This is Olivia Bitsui.
She's a photographer.

582
00:39:16,605 --> 00:39:19,025
In fact, she took this self-portrait.
Really lovely.

583
00:39:19,108 --> 00:39:22,111
Here's another picture
she took 54 years ago.

584
00:39:22,194 --> 00:39:24,114
- Kevin, say nothing.
- No, Kim, I got this.

585
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:26,323
- Kevin, I strongly advise...
- I know this picture.

586
00:39:26,407 --> 00:39:28,287
- My dad bought it, fair and square.
- Kevin.

587
00:39:28,325 --> 00:39:31,620
I have a copy of it hanging
in my office at home.

588
00:39:31,704 --> 00:39:34,165
I think we all just heard
Mr. Wachtell admit

589
00:39:34,248 --> 00:39:36,542
that he owns a copy
of Olivia Bitsui's photo.

590
00:39:36,625 --> 00:39:40,671
A photo that looks remarkably
like the official Mesa Verde logo.

591
00:39:40,755 --> 00:39:42,673
That's right. We own it.

592
00:39:42,757 --> 00:39:45,318
You own a copy of the photo,
you don't own the rights to it.

593
00:39:45,342 --> 00:39:46,802
That's copyright infringement.

594
00:39:46,886 --> 00:39:48,512
You'll never be able to prove that.

595
00:39:48,596 --> 00:39:50,222
Well, you know what?

596
00:39:51,348 --> 00:39:54,602
Looks like a mirror image there.

597
00:39:54,685 --> 00:39:57,855
So I think I can convince a judge
and probably a jury

598
00:39:57,938 --> 00:40:02,526
that Mesa Verde misappropriated
Miss Bitsui's intellectual property.

599
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:05,154
It's not your fault. Sins of the father.

600
00:40:05,237 --> 00:40:07,740
But we filed an injunction.

601
00:40:07,823 --> 00:40:10,785
So you're gonna have to take down
all your horsey logos,

602
00:40:10,868 --> 00:40:13,871
or at least throw a big tarp over them,
till we can get this settled.

603
00:40:13,954 --> 00:40:17,166
Shouldn't take more than, I don't know,
a couple years?

604
00:40:17,249 --> 00:40:20,127
We'll be seeing a lot of each other.
Till next time.

605
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,478
The problem we're facing

606
00:40:37,561 --> 00:40:40,161
is that none of the so-called victims
said, Mesa Verde did this.

607
00:40:40,231 --> 00:40:41,398
Everybody said, my bank.

608
00:40:41,482 --> 00:40:44,568
- They never used the words Mesa Verde.
- But it's our images, our logo...

609
00:40:44,652 --> 00:40:46,362
Paige, it's all heavily inferred,

610
00:40:46,445 --> 00:40:48,325
but it's done in a way
to keep us in the courts.

611
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:51,158
- We'll be going round and round.
- How do we keep them off the air?

612
00:40:51,242 --> 00:40:54,078
- We're gonna have to get ahead of him.
- How?

613
00:40:54,161 --> 00:40:57,748
We notify the stations that
they're susceptible to a libel suit...

614
00:40:57,832 --> 00:41:00,084
It might be an extended game
of whack-a-mole.

615
00:41:00,167 --> 00:41:02,169
Any way you slice this,
it's a long-haul battle.

616
00:41:02,253 --> 00:41:03,754
We have to take things one at a time.

617
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:06,298
Meanwhile, we have to counter
the copyright injunction.

618
00:41:06,382 --> 00:41:09,635
We can start with that.
That's important...

619
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,515
- Kevin.
- Kevin, Kevin.

620
00:41:14,598 --> 00:41:17,685
I know you're upset,
but please, don't do anything rash.

621
00:41:17,768 --> 00:41:21,397
Let your lawyers take care of it.
We'll fix this.

622
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,691
Kim, can I just go to the men's room?

623
00:41:24,692 --> 00:41:25,818
Of course. Yeah.

624
00:41:26,819 --> 00:41:29,446
Okay, now, with the
copyright infringement, I think we...

625
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:38,581
505-503-4455 today.

626
00:41:40,624 --> 00:41:42,418
Where are you?

627
00:41:44,003 --> 00:41:45,754
Stay there.

628
00:41:59,059 --> 00:42:00,059
What'll it take?

629
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:03,772
Oh, you're gonna have
to be more specific.

630
00:42:04,773 --> 00:42:06,775
I let Acker stay
in his shitty little house,

631
00:42:06,859 --> 00:42:10,029
and I move my call centre,
and the rest goes away.

632
00:42:10,112 --> 00:42:12,114
Is that the game?

633
00:42:12,198 --> 00:42:16,827
As your counsellor, Miss Wexler,
informed you, I'm not allowed to do that.

634
00:42:16,911 --> 00:42:18,329
Give me a break.

635
00:42:18,412 --> 00:42:20,247
You're a third-rate huckster

636
00:42:20,331 --> 00:42:23,292
who'd sell your own mother's organs
to get what you want.

637
00:42:24,293 --> 00:42:26,253
What will it take?

638
00:42:26,337 --> 00:42:28,589
Mind you, again,

639
00:42:28,672 --> 00:42:32,801
I'm not actually allowed to do
any of this, not intentionally.

640
00:42:32,885 --> 00:42:35,054
Cut to the chase, jackass.

641
00:42:35,137 --> 00:42:40,226
Well, Kevin, would you close your eyes
and imagine a world with me?

642
00:42:41,393 --> 00:42:43,812
Just... If you...

643
00:42:43,896 --> 00:42:47,816
It's a world where Mr. Acker gets
to keep his house.

644
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:52,154
Plus the $45,000 you were gonna pay him
for his pain and suffering.

645
00:42:52,238 --> 00:42:56,075
And in this world,
you throw in a public apology.

646
00:42:56,158 --> 00:43:02,957
And imagine a world where Native American
photographer Olivia Bitsui is compensated

647
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:06,627
$200,000 for the use of her photo.

648
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:09,171
In addition to receiving future credit

649
00:43:09,255 --> 00:43:13,008
for the inspiration and use of the logo
for Mesa Verde.

650
00:43:13,092 --> 00:43:14,385
Also, you know what,

651
00:43:14,468 --> 00:43:16,971
throw in a public apology
for Miss Bitsui while you're at it.

652
00:43:17,054 --> 00:43:22,685
And then, then, I can imagine a world
where the injunction disappears.

653
00:43:22,768 --> 00:43:25,813
And those commercials?
Well, they'll never see the light of day.

654
00:43:25,896 --> 00:43:29,900
Then, poof, away they go, into a vault,
never to be seen by mortal eyes again.

655
00:43:29,984 --> 00:43:32,403
What do you think of that world,
huh, Kevin?

656
00:43:33,404 --> 00:43:34,989
You can open your eyes now.

657
00:43:36,282 --> 00:43:41,537
Can you imagine a world
where we shake hands on that? Man to man?

658
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:51,422
Yeah, he just dropped me off.

659
00:43:51,505 --> 00:43:54,091
The usual route, going south.

660
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:25,289
Baker 2-4-1 PD.

661
00:44:25,372 --> 00:44:27,458
Baker 2-4-1, go ahead.

662
00:44:27,541 --> 00:44:34,089
Ran a 26. Got a hit on a New Mexico plate,
1-Victor-1-5-Robert-Zebra.

663
00:44:34,173 --> 00:44:37,468
Grey Monte Carlo occupied by one male.

664
00:44:37,551 --> 00:44:41,889
Last seen headed south
on Brighton towards Lawrence.

665
00:44:41,972 --> 00:44:44,850
Units stand by for an attempt to locate
on a grey Monte Carlo

666
00:44:44,933 --> 00:44:47,770
occupied by one,
last seen in the area of...

667
00:45:09,917 --> 00:45:13,462
Turn off the vehicle.
Drop the keys out the window.

668
00:45:21,887 --> 00:45:25,182
Turn the vehicle off
and drop the keys out now!

669
00:46:05,931 --> 00:46:08,767
Hey, how'd it go?

670
00:46:14,648 --> 00:46:16,942
It was pretty perfect, right?

671
00:46:29,872 --> 00:46:31,540
Kim...

672
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:34,209
Kim.

673
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:39,089
Look, apologies, all right? I'm sorry.

674
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:43,760
For sandbagging you
with the old switcheroo.

675
00:46:43,844 --> 00:46:45,471
I should have warned you.

676
00:46:45,554 --> 00:46:50,476
But you know what?
You being angry at me, that worked.

677
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:53,854
You were concerned that Rich
was suspicious. Did he say anything?

678
00:46:53,937 --> 00:46:57,733
- No.
- Great. See?

679
00:46:57,816 --> 00:47:00,027
That anger, real anger,

680
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:03,489
it worked like a protective
immunity shield, you know?

681
00:47:03,572 --> 00:47:07,284
I mean, hey, emotion like that,
you can't fake it.

682
00:47:07,367 --> 00:47:09,077
No, you can't.

683
00:47:09,161 --> 00:47:12,998
Yeah, right? So, what did Kevin say?

684
00:47:13,081 --> 00:47:18,504
He said he was tired of lawyers.

685
00:47:18,587 --> 00:47:21,757
Wait, wait. Do the voice.
You gotta do the voice.

686
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:27,763
Kevin is sick of lawyers,
wants to be done with all of it.

687
00:47:27,846 --> 00:47:32,518
We explained that your agreement
is non-binding, but he doesn't care.

688
00:47:32,601 --> 00:47:34,228
He is sticking with the handshake.

689
00:47:34,311 --> 00:47:36,522
Boom. There you go.

690
00:47:36,605 --> 00:47:40,984
That's a plan cooked
and served to juicy perfection.

691
00:47:41,068 --> 00:47:43,529
We should celebrate, really.

692
00:47:43,612 --> 00:47:47,032
We'll go to a steakhouse,
get a couple bottles of red wine,

693
00:47:47,115 --> 00:47:50,452
some tiramisu, the whole nine yards.

694
00:47:52,246 --> 00:47:55,123
Okay, Kim, look, I said I was sorry.

695
00:47:55,207 --> 00:47:57,334
And again, it worked.

696
00:47:57,417 --> 00:48:01,755
No way that Rich or Paige could believe
that we were in cahoots.

697
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:04,550
Because guess what, we weren't.

698
00:48:06,385 --> 00:48:09,054
Acker gets to keep his home,
plus a nice chunk of change.

699
00:48:09,137 --> 00:48:12,349
Olivia Bitsui gets reparations
for being cheated.

700
00:48:12,432 --> 00:48:16,436
And Kevin still gets his call centre.
Everybody wins.

701
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:18,981
- You win, Jimmy.
- What?

702
00:48:19,064 --> 00:48:20,064
You win.

703
00:48:22,109 --> 00:48:26,238
Yeah. Well, I mean...
Well, we win. Us.

704
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:29,324
No, I didn't.

705
00:48:29,408 --> 00:48:31,994
What didn't you get that you wanted?

706
00:48:33,036 --> 00:48:36,039
- I don't trust you.
- Why?

707
00:48:37,666 --> 00:48:40,794
You played me.

708
00:48:40,877 --> 00:48:43,589
You made me the sucker again.

709
00:48:43,672 --> 00:48:44,673
Again? What... Wait.

710
00:48:44,756 --> 00:48:47,467
How can you be the sucker?
It was your plan.

711
00:48:47,551 --> 00:48:49,678
Oh, fuck you, Jimmy.

712
00:48:49,761 --> 00:48:53,682
God. I... You know what?

713
00:48:53,765 --> 00:48:55,976
I can't do this anymore.

714
00:48:56,059 --> 00:48:57,227
Kim, I was just...

715
00:48:57,311 --> 00:49:03,066
No, you turned you and me versus the bank
into you versus me.

716
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:06,320
And it is not just this.
It's the same thing, over and over again.

717
00:49:06,403 --> 00:49:09,156
No, I kept things from you to protect you.

718
00:49:09,239 --> 00:49:13,869
Look, if I got caught, and God forbid,
you're questioned under oath,

719
00:49:13,952 --> 00:49:15,829
you have plausible deniability.

720
00:49:15,912 --> 00:49:17,623
Jesus, Jimmy.

721
00:49:17,706 --> 00:49:21,668
You can excuse stabbing me in the back
by making it about protecting me?

722
00:49:21,752 --> 00:49:24,296
Is that... Is that really supposed
to justify everything?

723
00:49:24,379 --> 00:49:27,007
Okay, Kim, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. All right?

724
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:30,844
- It will... It will never happen again.
- That's a lie.

725
00:49:30,927 --> 00:49:33,930
I swear. I swear, it won't.

726
00:49:34,014 --> 00:49:38,185
Look me in the eye
and tell me it'll never happen again.

727
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:42,814
You can't.

728
00:49:44,232 --> 00:49:45,609
I don't believe you.

729
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:49,029
You don't believe yourself.

730
00:49:49,112 --> 00:49:53,408
It is a lie. You lie. I lie.

731
00:49:53,492 --> 00:49:57,621
This has to end.
I cannot keep living like this.

732
00:49:57,704 --> 00:50:00,666
- No, no, Kim, we can fix this.
- Shut up. Jimmy. Jimmy.

733
00:50:00,749 --> 00:50:02,626
You know this has to change.

734
00:50:02,709 --> 00:50:04,509
If you don't see it,
I don't know what to say,

735
00:50:04,586 --> 00:50:06,129
because we are at a breaking point.

736
00:50:06,213 --> 00:50:08,173
- Oh, God! No.
- Either we end this now...

737
00:50:08,256 --> 00:50:11,343
Either we end this now
and enjoy the time we had

738
00:50:11,426 --> 00:50:14,805
and go our separate ways,
or we're...

739
00:50:14,888 --> 00:50:16,056
Or what?

740
00:50:17,057 --> 00:50:19,726
Or we're... I mean...

741
00:50:21,937 --> 00:50:23,397
Or maybe...

742
00:50:30,487 --> 00:50:32,280
Maybe we get married?
