1
00:01:58,244 --> 00:01:59,913
Jimmy?

2
00:02:02,582 --> 00:02:03,582
Yeah.

3
00:02:04,793 --> 00:02:05,794
It's me.

4
00:02:10,423 --> 00:02:12,258
I'm okay.

5
00:04:05,455 --> 00:04:06,456
You sure?

6
00:04:07,457 --> 00:04:10,418
All right. Stay put,
call me if there's a problem.

7
00:04:11,628 --> 00:04:15,798
Doesn't look like anyone's been down
that road. Definitely no one official.

8
00:04:15,882 --> 00:04:18,051
Bodies, trucks, it's all still there.

9
00:04:18,134 --> 00:04:22,013
A couple of flatbeds headed their way.
They'll clear it all out.

10
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:24,474
Like it never happened.

11
00:04:24,557 --> 00:04:26,184
And the one who followed you?

12
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:29,479
We'll be damn lucky
if we ever find that guy.

13
00:04:29,562 --> 00:04:33,107
Well, that'll have to do.
He's in the middle of nowhere.

14
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:37,111
Don't go to sleep yet.

15
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:39,697
We gotta work on your story.

16
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,035
All right. Let's do it.

17
00:04:56,381 --> 00:04:59,258
De Guzman. Jorge.

18
00:05:15,608 --> 00:05:18,987
- Seven million dollars?
- Yep.

19
00:05:46,431 --> 00:05:47,724
I'm fine.

20
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:50,893
Seven million.

21
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:56,107
Your client has $7 million.

22
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,692
Where'd it come from?

23
00:05:58,943 --> 00:06:02,363
It's not for me to ask
where a client gets his money.

24
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,076
And just who exactly is your client?

25
00:06:08,703 --> 00:06:11,914
Jorge De Guzman.

26
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:35,645
Yes, hello?

27
00:06:38,441 --> 00:06:40,443
This is extra.

28
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:50,078
And now, Mr. De Guzman?

29
00:07:04,884 --> 00:07:09,013
Well. You must have a story.

30
00:07:10,014 --> 00:07:11,474
Car trouble. Yeah.

31
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:15,645
Broke down about six miles
from the pick-up site.

32
00:07:15,728 --> 00:07:18,731
You know there's no cell reception
out there, right?

33
00:07:20,191 --> 00:07:21,651
Car trouble.

34
00:07:21,734 --> 00:07:24,195
Yeah. Just kaput.

35
00:07:26,322 --> 00:07:27,740
So...

36
00:07:28,741 --> 00:07:31,911
Why so long?
It's not that far back to the main road.

37
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:33,830
You didn't just hitchhike?

38
00:07:33,913 --> 00:07:36,666
I thought of that.
But you know, 7 mil in cash,

39
00:07:36,749 --> 00:07:39,460
I was kind of afraid who might pick me up.

40
00:07:39,544 --> 00:07:41,420
I didn't think it was worth the risk.

41
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:43,589
I walked north.

42
00:07:43,673 --> 00:07:45,842
Probably not the smartest move,

43
00:07:45,925 --> 00:07:50,513
but after a night
lost in the desert, I made it.

44
00:07:53,766 --> 00:07:57,395
Well, that was the right call.

45
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:00,189
Hey. Hey. You did good, huh?

46
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:06,445
Anyway, listen, I wouldn't be too happy.

47
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:10,283
Seven mil, it really sent up a huge flare.

48
00:08:10,366 --> 00:08:12,076
They're looking into you.

49
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,954
I don't know how long Jorge De Guzman
is gonna hold up.

50
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:18,374
Hey, listen, by the time
these dipshits figure it out,

51
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:21,669
I will be long gone, man.

52
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,630
Back home in Mexico, you know?

53
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:27,300
Yeah.

54
00:08:27,383 --> 00:08:31,470
Hey! Hey, hey. But don't worry.
You and me? We're not done.

55
00:08:31,554 --> 00:08:34,640
We're gonna do things. Big things.

56
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:37,602
Friend of the cartel, right?

57
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:40,146
- Right.
- Right.

58
00:08:46,819 --> 00:08:50,448
So hey, my cousins. They pay you?

59
00:08:51,449 --> 00:08:53,034
Yep.

60
00:08:53,117 --> 00:08:54,619
Perfecto.

61
00:08:54,702 --> 00:08:58,372
So make sure you buy something nice
for the wife. Man, she's a looker, huh?

62
00:08:59,624 --> 00:09:01,083
My... My what?

63
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:04,003
Yeah! She came by to see me.

64
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:06,881
Hey, nice job, eh?

65
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:10,051
I mean, for somebody
who marries that far up...

66
00:09:11,052 --> 00:09:13,012
Bien hecho, man.

67
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:15,097
Respect, you know?

68
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:27,485
Let me help.

69
00:09:30,363 --> 00:09:31,906
There.

70
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:39,580
Oh, my God, Jimmy.
You need to go to an emergency room.

71
00:09:39,664 --> 00:09:43,834
I'm okay. I'm okay. I cleaned it out
real good at the truck stop.

72
00:09:43,918 --> 00:09:47,380
All right. Well, let's at least just go
get you an IV, huh? You're dehydrated.

73
00:09:47,463 --> 00:09:51,801
No. I don't need an IV.
I've been pounding sports drinks nonstop.

74
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:55,513
- I'm really okay.
- All right.

75
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:58,849
Come on, you're gonna get in this bath,
though, it'll help your skin.

76
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:05,273
What is this? Cream of Wheat?

77
00:10:05,356 --> 00:10:08,276
Oatmeal. It's an oatmeal bath.
Anti-inflammatory.

78
00:10:09,277 --> 00:10:11,237
It'll help your sunburn.

79
00:10:18,494 --> 00:10:21,622
- Is the temp okay?
- Yeah. It's good.

80
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:23,666
You sure?

81
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:25,835
Yeah.

82
00:10:26,836 --> 00:10:30,298
Okay. You don't want any food
or anything else to drink?

83
00:10:30,381 --> 00:10:31,924
No, I'm good.

84
00:10:32,008 --> 00:10:35,678
I just need to sit. This is good.

85
00:10:51,402 --> 00:10:55,031
I can't believe you walked
through the desert alone for 36 hours.

86
00:10:55,114 --> 00:10:57,950
I... I can't even fathom it.

87
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:00,578
That's right.

88
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:04,206
All by myself.

89
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,132
So...

90
00:11:15,426 --> 00:11:17,803
Is there anything you wanna tell me?

91
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:22,058
- About?
- Lalo.

92
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:24,810
You saw Lalo?

93
00:11:27,313 --> 00:11:28,814
Yeah.

94
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:32,109
Jimmy, short of going to the police,

95
00:11:32,193 --> 00:11:34,236
Lalo was the only lead
I had to figure out...

96
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,615
Kim, you have to stay away
from people like Lalo.

97
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:40,868
- Jimmy...
- You don't see Lalo.

98
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:42,912
I see Lalo, okay?

99
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:46,207
- I'm in the game. You're not in the game.
- What?

100
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,000
The game?

101
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:50,961
Listen, it was perfectly safe.

102
00:11:51,045 --> 00:11:54,840
I was at the MDC, surrounded by guards,
like any lawyer visiting a client, okay?

103
00:11:54,924 --> 00:11:56,384
But he's not your client.

104
00:11:56,467 --> 00:11:59,637
He's my client.
So please, just keep away.

105
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,890
Jimmy, I was worried about you.

106
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:05,184
And I'm worried about you.

107
00:12:06,227 --> 00:12:08,229
Kim, when I was out there...

108
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:12,233
I didn't think I was gonna make it.

109
00:12:12,316 --> 00:12:16,153
I thought I was done.

110
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:20,533
I was that close to giving up.

111
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:24,412
And the only thing that kept me going...

112
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:28,582
was knowing that you were here.

113
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:31,710
So...

114
00:12:33,796 --> 00:12:34,964
Okay.

115
00:12:36,215 --> 00:12:38,467
I won't see Lalo again.

116
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:41,470
Good.

117
00:12:43,222 --> 00:12:44,640
Good.

118
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,043
After all this...

119
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:16,672
was it worth it?

120
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:24,054
Go look in the bag.

121
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:28,934
The bag in the living room.

122
00:13:34,315 --> 00:13:35,691
It's on the chair.

123
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:37,943
It's a grey bag.

124
00:14:10,935 --> 00:14:12,186
You see it?

125
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:16,398
Yeah, Jimmy.

126
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:19,193
I see it.

127
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,948
That's what it's all about.

128
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:45,511
Six guys, three vehicles, heavily armed.

129
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:49,765
My guess is they followed
the Salamanca cousins up from Chihuahua,

130
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:53,394
trailing the money
but not wanting to take these two guys on.

131
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:57,314
Now, I'm no expert, but they had tattoos.

132
00:14:57,398 --> 00:14:59,942
Same symbol I saw on a job back east.

133
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:01,986
A Colombian gang.

134
00:15:02,987 --> 00:15:04,905
Draw it for me.

135
00:15:32,141 --> 00:15:33,976
These men were hired.

136
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:36,604
By who?

137
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,460
I trust you heard the good news.

138
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:02,046
Gustavo, which good news is that?

139
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:06,550
Our colleague has been released
by the American authorities.

140
00:16:06,634 --> 00:16:11,513
At a substantial price, but he's free.

141
00:16:11,597 --> 00:16:15,601
And I'm told he will be returning home
to continue operations.

142
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:19,772
That is good news.
But coming south, you say?

143
00:16:19,855 --> 00:16:20,856
That's correct.

144
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:25,069
Forfeiting bail is the only way
to assure he remains out of prison.

145
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:27,363
Well, then.
All will be returning to normal.

146
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:32,034
And I trust your run of bad luck
will be behind you.

147
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:33,702
Bad luck?

148
00:16:33,786 --> 00:16:37,831
The DEA. The fire. The arrest.

149
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:40,793
My hope is that it's over.

150
00:16:42,211 --> 00:16:45,964
Yes. I believe the coming weeks
will be our best yet.

151
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:49,051
Excellent.
I'll pass on the good news.

152
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:53,263
Thank you. Enjoy your evening.

153
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:01,855
I just spoke to the man
responsible for the attack.

154
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:06,360
Someone we need to worry about?

155
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:09,571
He was trying to protect his own business

156
00:17:09,655 --> 00:17:11,782
by protecting our business.

157
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:14,993
If that's him trying to help...

158
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:18,330
He knows nothing
of what we are trying to accomplish.

159
00:17:18,414 --> 00:17:21,875
Once Salamanca is south of the border,

160
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:25,713
our actions must be unimpeachable.

161
00:17:25,796 --> 00:17:30,384
Any reflection on me
will not be greeted with kindness.

162
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,970
All right.

163
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:41,687
Yes?

164
00:17:43,272 --> 00:17:45,858
There's one other thing we should discuss.

165
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:51,697
Nacho Varga. He wants out.

166
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:56,243
He's done everything we asked,
he held up his end.

167
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:59,079
I think it's time we cut him loose.

168
00:17:59,163 --> 00:18:01,290
I see no reason to give up an asset.

169
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:05,169
Once Salamanca's dealt with,
we have no use for Varga.

170
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:07,421
He's the only guy they have
running things up here.

171
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:11,717
He disappears,
Salamanca operation falls apart.

172
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:20,392
Varga stays.

173
00:18:20,476 --> 00:18:23,812
Better to control the opposition
without their knowledge.

174
00:18:26,982 --> 00:18:29,401
You have a gun to his father's head.

175
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:31,779
That doesn't sit with me.

176
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,407
You wanna keep Varga for the long run,

177
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:39,620
I don't think fear is a great motivator.

178
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:48,253
A dog who bites every owner he's had...

179
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:52,382
can only be disciplined with a firm hand.

180
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:55,803
Or put down.

181
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:10,442
He's taking care of business tonight.

182
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:13,570
Tomorrow morning,
he's seeing Hector to say goodbye.

183
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:17,533
After that, I drive him south.
He didn't tell me where.

184
00:19:17,616 --> 00:19:19,618
All I know is I'm dropping him off

185
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:23,288
and somebody else is taking him
over the border.

186
00:19:23,372 --> 00:19:24,581
Is that it?

187
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:27,251
Yeah. Hey...

188
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:33,340
Once he's down, that's it, right?
He's done?

189
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:37,553
Just do what you're told.
Don't worry about it.

190
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:58,239
Hey.

191
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:00,200
Hungry?

192
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:06,123
You good with cereal?
Or you want me to try an omelette?

193
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:10,669
Cereal.
Probably the safest thing for my stomach.

194
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:12,546
- Okay.
- I'll get it.

195
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:14,631
No, no, no. I got it. Just...

196
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:17,259
Just relax.

197
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,729
You going in late today?

198
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:33,692
I just thought I'd stay home today.

199
00:20:36,153 --> 00:20:37,988
Kim, I can take care of myself.

200
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:42,618
Well, I already called in sick,
so you're stuck with me.

201
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,156
Damn it!

202
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:23,617
Shit.

203
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,702
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

204
00:21:26,745 --> 00:21:28,914
I guess my stomach's
just not ready for this yet.

205
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,251
It's okay.

206
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:37,673
Not a big deal.

207
00:21:56,108 --> 00:21:58,485
Are you sure you don't have to go in
to work?

208
00:21:58,568 --> 00:22:01,905
Yeah, I'm sure.
We both need to take it easy.

209
00:22:01,989 --> 00:22:03,949
How about a day without drama?

210
00:22:05,117 --> 00:22:07,119
That sounds real good actually.

211
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:10,580
Oh, hi, Skinny.

212
00:22:10,664 --> 00:22:12,958
- Hello, Ruth.
- Well, Maisie's here.

213
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:15,395
How are you?
Tell me, is the lord of the universe in?

214
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:18,619
Yes, he's in, in a bad humour.
Somebody must have stolen the crown jewel.

215
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:21,800
- Shall we announce you?
- Oh, no, no. I'll blow my own horn.

216
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:24,511
Bruce, you should better wait here.
I'll be back in 10 minutes.

217
00:22:24,594 --> 00:22:27,764
Even 10 minutes is a long time
to be away from you.

218
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:30,934
- What did you say?
- What?

219
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:33,687
- Well...
- Go on.

220
00:22:35,147 --> 00:22:36,273
Well, go ahead.

221
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:39,776
Well, I just said, even 10 minutes
is a long time to be away from you.

222
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,620
I heard you the first time.
I like it,

223
00:22:41,653 --> 00:22:43,989
that's why I asked you to say it again.

224
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:45,407
I can stand being spoiled.

225
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,802
The gentleman I'm going in to see
did very little spoiling.

226
00:22:47,826 --> 00:22:51,014
I'd like to spoil him just once.
You sure you don't want me to go with you?

227
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:54,207
- Oh, no. I can handle it.
- If things get rough, I'm here.

228
00:22:58,628 --> 00:23:00,380
Hi, Hildy. Welcome back.

229
00:23:00,464 --> 00:23:03,341
Saul Goodman. Speedy justice for you.

230
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:10,724
I'm sorry. No. Today...
It's impossible today. I can't help you.

231
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:14,102
Yeah, that's right.

232
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:21,485
Wait, what are they saying?

233
00:23:22,986 --> 00:23:24,196
Are you...?

234
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:26,698
Just wait 45 minutes. I can be there.

235
00:23:26,782 --> 00:23:28,450
What? Jimmy, no.

236
00:23:28,533 --> 00:23:30,660
Yeah.
You tell them I'm on my way.

237
00:23:31,703 --> 00:23:33,705
Jimmy. Jimmy.

238
00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:36,041
You can barely walk.
What are you doing?

239
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:38,627
It's my client. He's in big trouble.

240
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,673
They're trying to kill his plea deal
because his buddy was carrying weed.

241
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:44,715
What? Okay.

242
00:23:44,716 --> 00:23:47,594
So get a continuance.
You don't have to do this today.

243
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:49,346
No, this guy's scared out of his mind.

244
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:52,307
I wouldn't feel right leaving him hanging.

245
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,894
Jimmy, look, I know you're lying.

246
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:04,486
And I know something terrible
happened in the desert.

247
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:10,117
This isn't about our deal, I'm not
insisting or forcing you to tell me.

248
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,576
I just...

249
00:24:13,578 --> 00:24:17,666
want you to know that I'm here for you.

250
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:25,048
And you can tell me, okay?

251
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:27,551
No judgements.

252
00:24:31,596 --> 00:24:33,223
No judgements.

253
00:24:39,104 --> 00:24:40,438
You're right.

254
00:24:41,857 --> 00:24:44,484
Something did happen out there.

255
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:50,532
When I was in the desert...

256
00:24:53,577 --> 00:24:56,204
I had to drink my own pee.

257
00:24:57,706 --> 00:25:03,044
I was out of water, and in order
to survive, I had to drink pee.

258
00:25:04,171 --> 00:25:07,549
Well... Yeah, that's it, so...

259
00:25:08,884 --> 00:25:11,970
And there you go. Look...

260
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:16,016
I will recover,
and we never need to mention this again.

261
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:19,311
I'm gonna go get changed,
and I'm gonna get down there.

262
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,372
Kim. Feeling better?

263
00:25:39,456 --> 00:25:42,209
Oh, yeah. Just a 24-hour thing.
It passed.

264
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:44,836
I thought I should come in
and prep the Colorado meeting.

265
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,964
They moved that up to this morning.
Stef handled it.

266
00:25:48,048 --> 00:25:50,091
There was no pushback
from Boulder city council?

267
00:25:50,175 --> 00:25:53,970
Stef cleared up the conditional use issue.
Everything's moving forward.

268
00:25:54,054 --> 00:25:56,139
Wow, that's great.

269
00:25:57,432 --> 00:25:58,475
Great.

270
00:25:59,768 --> 00:26:01,394
Well...

271
00:26:03,104 --> 00:26:04,022
Okay.

272
00:26:04,023 --> 00:26:07,735
You wanted to write letters
to the planning board in Broomfield.

273
00:26:07,817 --> 00:26:10,320
Right. Yes, that's right.

274
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:12,948
I'll get started on that,
if you can just get me those names.

275
00:26:13,031 --> 00:26:16,368
- List is on your desk.
- Of course. Great.

276
00:26:20,705 --> 00:26:23,667
First letter is for Mr. Armand Bakaris,

277
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:26,002
chairman of
the Planning and Zoning Commission,

278
00:26:26,086 --> 00:26:28,880
and let's just CC the vice chair,

279
00:26:28,964 --> 00:26:31,258
Elaine Perlman, while we're at it.

280
00:26:32,384 --> 00:26:34,344
Dear Mr. Bakaris,

281
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:36,304
Mesa Verde Bank and Trust
respectfully submit

282
00:26:36,388 --> 00:26:39,474
the following request
for your consideration.

283
00:26:39,557 --> 00:26:42,811
In regards to the resolution number...

284
00:26:43,812 --> 00:26:48,900
PZ 2004-dash-36 variance appeal

285
00:26:48,984 --> 00:26:54,489
to allow for a six-and-one-half foot
encroachment into the...

286
00:26:56,992 --> 00:26:59,995
into the minimum required rear setback...

287
00:27:07,085 --> 00:27:12,215
minimum required rear setback for a...

288
00:27:13,258 --> 00:27:15,677
drive-thru awning to allow...

289
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,305
Strike that. To facilitate...

290
00:27:19,514 --> 00:27:23,727
access to the property at...

291
00:27:26,938 --> 00:27:28,606
841 North.

292
00:27:29,774 --> 00:27:34,321
So can you call his assistant and get
some intel on what he's into right now?

293
00:27:34,404 --> 00:27:37,615
Kim, they told me you were out sick today.

294
00:27:37,699 --> 00:27:41,911
Yeah. No, I...
Rich, you free to talk?

295
00:27:41,995 --> 00:27:43,204
Yeah, is everything okay?

296
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:46,041
Yeah. I just need a minute.

297
00:27:46,124 --> 00:27:47,584
Okay.

298
00:27:52,672 --> 00:27:55,759
So, what's up?

299
00:27:55,842 --> 00:27:57,093
I...

300
00:28:05,268 --> 00:28:06,353
What?

301
00:28:22,952 --> 00:28:25,455
Marcie, can you do me a favour?

302
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:28,375
Copy all the pro bono files
and send the originals to my place.

303
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:32,253
Also, no rush, but
box up my diplomas and photos, please.

304
00:28:32,337 --> 00:28:34,381
Are we moving offices?

305
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:36,025
I don't want you to worry.
I talked to Rich,

306
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:38,093
you'll be reassigned to another partner.

307
00:28:38,176 --> 00:28:39,260
Wait, reassigned?

308
00:28:39,344 --> 00:28:42,097
Oh, and they're gonna want these.

309
00:28:43,098 --> 00:28:46,101
I'm parked in my usual spot.

310
00:28:46,184 --> 00:28:50,480
If I left anything else in there,
just put it in the box.

311
00:28:52,607 --> 00:28:54,067
Thank you, Marcie.

312
00:28:55,068 --> 00:28:57,278
- Good luck.
- Kim...

313
00:29:21,469 --> 00:29:22,846
Look...

314
00:29:23,138 --> 00:29:27,100
Cops are gonna go crazy looking for me
for a few months.

315
00:29:27,183 --> 00:29:29,227
Maybe a year.

316
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:32,313
Then the heat will die down,
like it always does.

317
00:29:32,397 --> 00:29:33,481
Until then,

318
00:29:33,565 --> 00:29:38,111
Ignacio or one of the other guys,
they'll get you anything you need.

319
00:29:39,487 --> 00:29:41,573
Tio, come on. Don't be this way.

320
00:29:42,574 --> 00:29:46,369
There are still lots of moves
to make against Fring.

321
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:53,001
When I'm home, I'll have Eladio's ear.

322
00:29:53,084 --> 00:29:58,006
I'll make sure
he's sick of the Chicken Man.

323
00:29:58,089 --> 00:30:00,091
Then,

324
00:30:00,175 --> 00:30:01,801
what's Fring's...

325
00:30:02,969 --> 00:30:04,471
will be ours.

326
00:30:06,764 --> 00:30:11,019
Eleven months from now, Tuco gets out
of prison. He'll run things here.

327
00:30:12,061 --> 00:30:16,983
I know, I know. Tuco. He's a hothead.

328
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:19,360
When he's on the stuff, he's...

329
00:30:22,238 --> 00:30:24,991
We'll make sure someone is on him.

330
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:27,785
He'll stay clean.

331
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:29,245
Hi, there.

332
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:32,373
We're bringing birthday cake out
for Louise, one of our residents.

333
00:30:32,457 --> 00:30:35,835
Everyone's going to sing.
Hector really doesn't like to miss these.

334
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:39,756
Yeah.
Could you give us a minute, please?

335
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:53,895
Family is everything.

336
00:31:07,825 --> 00:31:09,410
Okay, guys.

337
00:31:11,913 --> 00:31:16,000
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

338
00:31:16,084 --> 00:31:19,754
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

339
00:31:19,837 --> 00:31:24,676
<i>Happy birthday dear Louise</i>

340
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:28,680
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

341
00:31:51,953 --> 00:31:53,204
Where to?

342
00:31:54,205 --> 00:31:56,082
Go. The border.

343
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:28,364
Hey, that was something.
What happened in there?

344
00:32:28,448 --> 00:32:30,908
Hey, look, don't feel bad.
You can't win them all.

345
00:32:30,992 --> 00:32:34,329
But that one? Sheesh, I thought for sure
I was gonna lose.

346
00:32:34,412 --> 00:32:36,956
There wasn't a chance in hell
I was supposed to win that one.

347
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,750
But there you were.

348
00:32:38,833 --> 00:32:41,461
Snatching defeat
from the jaws of victory.

349
00:32:42,462 --> 00:32:45,214
Ball in your hand, at the goal line,

350
00:32:45,298 --> 00:32:46,883
fumble!

351
00:32:46,966 --> 00:32:50,595
Law students are gonna review the
Goodman Debacle as a teachable moment.

352
00:32:50,678 --> 00:32:51,929
So at least there's that.

353
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:55,600
And think of all the kids
you'll help learn what not to do

354
00:32:55,683 --> 00:32:57,644
when faced with underwhelming odds.

355
00:32:57,727 --> 00:32:59,187
So embarrassing.

356
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:02,106
You'll probably have to change your name.
Again.

357
00:33:11,866 --> 00:33:16,162
Hey, just so you know,
I don't think any less of you.

358
00:33:16,245 --> 00:33:18,665
You're still a lawyer.

359
00:33:55,076 --> 00:33:57,995
You can start talking any time.

360
00:33:59,288 --> 00:34:03,710
You said this goes away.
So, what's the time frame on that?

361
00:34:07,714 --> 00:34:10,550
It's different for different people,
I suppose.

362
00:34:11,634 --> 00:34:15,513
For me.
When will this be over for me?

363
00:34:18,057 --> 00:34:20,601
Well, here's what's gonna happen.

364
00:34:20,685 --> 00:34:22,228
One day...

365
00:34:22,311 --> 00:34:24,647
One day, you're gonna wake up,

366
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:28,818
eat your breakfast, brush your teeth,
go about your business.

367
00:34:30,695 --> 00:34:33,030
And sooner or later,

368
00:34:33,114 --> 00:34:35,700
you're gonna realise

369
00:34:35,783 --> 00:34:37,535
you haven't thought about it.

370
00:34:38,703 --> 00:34:40,163
None of it.

371
00:34:43,082 --> 00:34:45,334
And that's the moment

372
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:47,378
you realise you can forget.

373
00:34:48,379 --> 00:34:52,341
When you know that's possible,
it all gets easier.

374
00:34:52,425 --> 00:34:54,719
But what about you? Like...

375
00:34:54,802 --> 00:34:56,971
What happened out there
doesn't bother you?

376
00:34:57,972 --> 00:35:02,185
Them wanting to steal the 7 million
didn't work for me.

377
00:35:02,268 --> 00:35:05,480
Not to mention, they wanted to shoot you
in the head.

378
00:35:05,563 --> 00:35:09,150
It was them or it was us.
Cut and dried.

379
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:12,695
They were in the game.

380
00:35:17,492 --> 00:35:19,118
What about Fred?

381
00:35:20,203 --> 00:35:21,496
From Travel Wire.

382
00:35:22,538 --> 00:35:24,123
Was he in the game?

383
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:27,585
No.

384
00:35:28,878 --> 00:35:31,422
There was a lot wrong
with what happened there.

385
00:35:31,506 --> 00:35:32,799
Yeah. Lalo.

386
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,929
Lalo killed that guy. And for what?

387
00:35:38,012 --> 00:35:41,098
He killed that guy, and we're helping him.

388
00:35:45,019 --> 00:35:47,522
All this shit, just to...

389
00:35:48,564 --> 00:35:52,068
So he can get out of jail
and just get away?

390
00:35:53,152 --> 00:35:55,321
It's not the end of the story.

391
00:35:57,323 --> 00:35:58,825
Wait a minute.
What does that mean?

392
00:35:58,908 --> 00:36:02,328
Not the end of the story.
What are you saying?

393
00:36:02,411 --> 00:36:06,165
Are you saying what I think you're saying?
Something gonna happen to Lalo?

394
00:36:06,249 --> 00:36:08,417
I didn't say that.

395
00:36:08,501 --> 00:36:12,713
Oh, Jesus. What have I gotten myself
involved with here?

396
00:36:12,797 --> 00:36:16,968
- Look, just tell me, what are you saying...
- Look.

397
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:21,138
We all make our choices.

398
00:36:21,222 --> 00:36:24,934
Now, those choices, they put us on a road.

399
00:36:25,017 --> 00:36:29,689
Sometimes those choices seem small,
but they put you on the road.

400
00:36:29,772 --> 00:36:32,525
You think about getting off.

401
00:36:33,985 --> 00:36:36,404
But eventually, you're back on it.

402
00:36:37,405 --> 00:36:39,532
And the road we're on led us out
to the desert,

403
00:36:39,615 --> 00:36:41,325
and everything that happened there,

404
00:36:41,409 --> 00:36:45,580
and straight back
to where we are right now.

405
00:36:46,789 --> 00:36:48,457
And nothing...

406
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:52,837
Nothing can be done about that.

407
00:36:54,463 --> 00:36:56,966
Do you understand that?

408
00:37:01,554 --> 00:37:03,806
I can't believe...

409
00:37:05,224 --> 00:37:09,312
I can't believe there's, like,
over a billion people on this planet,

410
00:37:09,395 --> 00:37:13,024
and the only person
I have to talk about this to is you.

411
00:38:40,611 --> 00:38:41,988
You want me to wait?

412
00:38:42,989 --> 00:38:44,365
Nah.

413
00:38:44,448 --> 00:38:45,908
They'll be here.

414
00:38:45,992 --> 00:38:48,077
Really. Go.

415
00:38:50,454 --> 00:38:51,454
You sure?

416
00:38:51,455 --> 00:38:53,332
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

417
00:38:53,416 --> 00:38:54,750
Look, I'll be in touch, man.

418
00:38:54,834 --> 00:38:57,253
Hey, that fire you did at Fring's...

419
00:38:58,546 --> 00:39:00,423
That was good work, man.

420
00:39:00,506 --> 00:39:01,590
We're gonna do more.

421
00:39:01,674 --> 00:39:02,717
You'll see.

422
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:07,138
Sounds good.

423
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:33,956
Take me back up the road.
Slow.

424
00:39:38,085 --> 00:39:39,086
What for?

425
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:42,256
Just do it.
Six or seven miles back.

426
00:39:57,313 --> 00:39:58,773
What are we looking for?

427
00:39:59,857 --> 00:40:02,485
The lawyer said his car broke down.

428
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:08,157
Six miles from the pick-up.
Where is it?

429
00:40:13,537 --> 00:40:16,248
Whoa, let me out here.
Let me out.

430
00:41:32,241 --> 00:41:33,325
Come.

431
00:41:33,409 --> 00:41:35,452
Back to Albuquerque.

432
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,167
What about Marco and Leonel?

433
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:44,545
What about them? I'll get them a message.
Let's go.

434
00:42:30,341 --> 00:42:31,341
Jimmy?

435
00:42:34,136 --> 00:42:35,136
You okay?

436
00:42:39,725 --> 00:42:41,644
Yeah, what time is it?

437
00:42:41,727 --> 00:42:44,146
It's 6:30.

438
00:42:45,773 --> 00:42:47,816
Oh, sorry.
You wanna go back to sleep?

439
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,986
No. I'm up.

440
00:42:53,822 --> 00:42:57,284
You can still go to a doctor, you know?
No harm in getting checked out.

441
00:42:58,369 --> 00:43:00,329
I'm fine.

442
00:43:00,412 --> 00:43:03,832
I think I just need food.

443
00:43:03,916 --> 00:43:07,086
I haven't eaten since...

444
00:43:07,169 --> 00:43:10,381
well, really, before everything.

445
00:43:10,464 --> 00:43:11,882
Okay.

446
00:43:11,966 --> 00:43:15,469
Maybe go easy.
Just some soup at first.

447
00:43:15,552 --> 00:43:17,680
I'm okay, Kim. Really.

448
00:43:18,722 --> 00:43:19,722
I know.

449
00:43:20,891 --> 00:43:22,142
Good.

450
00:43:22,226 --> 00:43:23,727
Good.

451
00:43:25,271 --> 00:43:27,064
What about you? You seem...

452
00:43:28,274 --> 00:43:30,484
worried, maybe?

453
00:43:31,485 --> 00:43:33,904
No. No, no. It's just...

454
00:43:34,905 --> 00:43:37,408
I have news, but it can wait.

455
00:43:37,491 --> 00:43:39,785
- Let's get some food in you first.
- What news?

456
00:43:39,868 --> 00:43:43,622
- What kind of news?
- Nothing bad.

457
00:43:44,999 --> 00:43:48,460
So that means it's good news?

458
00:43:50,337 --> 00:43:52,047
Yeah. I think so.

459
00:43:53,048 --> 00:43:54,883
Great. Let me hear it.

460
00:43:59,805 --> 00:44:02,558
I...

461
00:44:02,641 --> 00:44:05,561
quit Schweikart and Cokely.

462
00:44:07,396 --> 00:44:09,440
And I gave up Mesa Verde.

463
00:44:13,277 --> 00:44:15,404
How about we get some food together?

464
00:44:16,905 --> 00:44:17,905
Wait.

465
00:44:19,533 --> 00:44:22,202
What happened? Did somebody
say something about what we did?

466
00:44:22,286 --> 00:44:23,370
- No.
- What, was it Rich?

467
00:44:23,454 --> 00:44:27,666
Nobody said anything.
It just, it felt right.

468
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:29,626
It felt right. What? How?

469
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:30,711
I...

470
00:44:30,794 --> 00:44:36,675
I just... I keep pushing Mesa Verde away
to do my pro bono work, and then...

471
00:44:37,676 --> 00:44:38,969
when you were gone,

472
00:44:39,053 --> 00:44:42,431
I didn't know what happened.
I mean, I...

473
00:44:42,514 --> 00:44:46,060
I thought you were dead. So...

474
00:44:47,144 --> 00:44:50,522
That was... All of it helped me.

475
00:44:50,606 --> 00:44:53,233
To see what's important and what isn't.

476
00:44:55,444 --> 00:44:59,656
So you're just gonna throw it all away?
I mean, you busted your ass for all of it.

477
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:02,951
I'm not throwing it away. I did S&C.

478
00:45:03,035 --> 00:45:06,330
I did Mesa Verde. I achieved that.

479
00:45:06,413 --> 00:45:10,501
I had that experience,
but it doesn't make me happy.

480
00:45:11,668 --> 00:45:14,296
Look, it's been a rough couple of days.

481
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:17,216
So why don't you just hold off
on a final decision?

482
00:45:17,299 --> 00:45:19,343
Call Rich,
tell him you're thinking it over.

483
00:45:19,426 --> 00:45:22,471
I already talked to Rich.
And I called Paige.

484
00:45:22,554 --> 00:45:26,183
We had a nice, very long conversation.
It's done.

485
00:45:26,266 --> 00:45:29,019
Then I spent the afternoon
in the courthouse with pro bono clients

486
00:45:29,103 --> 00:45:31,105
without Mesa Verde hanging over my head.

487
00:45:31,188 --> 00:45:33,399
Best afternoon I've had in a long time.

488
00:45:33,482 --> 00:45:35,192
All right, pro bono is wonderful.

489
00:45:35,275 --> 00:45:38,404
It is, but pro bono means no money.

490
00:45:38,487 --> 00:45:40,155
So, what's the plan here?

491
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,784
I don't know. But I'll figure it out.

492
00:45:43,867 --> 00:45:48,038
Okay. Leaving Schweikart, I get that.
It's a bunch of stuffed shirts.

493
00:45:48,122 --> 00:45:50,040
But Mesa Verde?

494
00:45:50,124 --> 00:45:54,128
That's like leaving the Yankees
to play amateur ring toss.

495
00:45:54,211 --> 00:45:58,966
No, it's not. I'm leaving something
that makes zero difference in the world

496
00:45:59,049 --> 00:46:01,468
to help people who are actually in need.

497
00:46:02,761 --> 00:46:04,763
This is a bad idea.

498
00:46:04,847 --> 00:46:06,265
What?

499
00:46:06,348 --> 00:46:09,059
Look. We all make choices, right?

500
00:46:09,143 --> 00:46:11,812
And those choices, they put us on a road.

501
00:46:11,895 --> 00:46:14,690
And the road has good choices,
and it has bad choices.

502
00:46:14,773 --> 00:46:17,985
This is a bad choice road.

503
00:46:19,194 --> 00:46:21,029
- What are you even talking about?
- I'm...

504
00:46:22,114 --> 00:46:24,741
Saying that bad choices lead to bad roads

505
00:46:24,825 --> 00:46:27,035
that lead to bad places.

506
00:46:28,454 --> 00:46:32,749
When you decided to be Saul Goodman,
I didn't get it.

507
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:34,501
Still don't, really.

508
00:46:34,585 --> 00:46:36,628
But I stood by your decision.

509
00:46:36,712 --> 00:46:39,089
And I'm not changing my identity,
I'm just leaving a job.

510
00:46:39,173 --> 00:46:41,175
What I did was completely different.

511
00:46:41,258 --> 00:46:43,927
- How?
- I was leaving failure for success.

512
00:46:44,011 --> 00:46:47,514
It's not different.
You believed it was right for you.

513
00:46:47,598 --> 00:46:50,392
Give me the courtesy of believing
this is right for me.

514
00:46:50,476 --> 00:46:53,812
And I'm giving you a reality check.
This is too far, too fast.

515
00:46:53,896 --> 00:46:58,567
And I'm giving you a reality check.
This is really none of your damn business.

516
00:47:08,702 --> 00:47:10,370
- Yeah?
- Listen to me.

517
00:47:10,454 --> 00:47:13,665
Put your phone down.
Leave it on, so I can hear.

518
00:47:13,749 --> 00:47:15,584
So you can hear... Hear what?

519
00:47:15,667 --> 00:47:18,170
Do what I said right now.

520
00:47:18,253 --> 00:47:20,923
Put it down somewhere it can't be seen.

521
00:47:24,635 --> 00:47:25,969
Jimmy.

522
00:47:40,484 --> 00:47:41,777
Hey, guys.

523
00:47:42,861 --> 00:47:44,196
Can I come in?

524
00:47:46,698 --> 00:47:47,866
Lalo.

525
00:47:48,867 --> 00:47:50,869
Thought you'd be down south.

526
00:47:50,953 --> 00:47:52,454
Enjoying your freedom.

527
00:47:52,538 --> 00:47:54,540
Yeah, well...

528
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:57,501
Had some business to attend to.

529
00:47:58,877 --> 00:48:00,337
Told you he'd be back.

530
00:48:01,338 --> 00:48:04,132
Nice. I like it.

531
00:48:05,551 --> 00:48:09,513
Hey, look, you want a drink?
We got some beer in the fridge.

532
00:48:09,596 --> 00:48:11,181
Unless you're not staying that...

533
00:48:13,267 --> 00:48:15,477
You shouldn't... I'm sorry.

534
00:48:16,687 --> 00:48:21,775
Sorry, you shouldn't do that.
It upsets the fish.

535
00:48:39,585 --> 00:48:42,045
Look, you wanna talk, we can talk.

536
00:48:42,129 --> 00:48:44,381
But Kim was just stepping out, so...

537
00:48:44,464 --> 00:48:46,925
Nah. She can stay.

538
00:48:47,968 --> 00:48:52,180
I mean, she is part of the legal team,
right?

539
00:48:54,141 --> 00:48:57,269
Hey, relax, sit down.
We're just gonna talk.

540
00:48:58,353 --> 00:49:01,273
Come on. Sit.

541
00:49:04,276 --> 00:49:05,611
Okay.

542
00:49:14,077 --> 00:49:15,329
So...

543
00:49:17,456 --> 00:49:18,957
Tell me what happened.

544
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:21,918
What happened?

545
00:49:22,002 --> 00:49:25,255
Yeah, when you picked up the money.

546
00:49:25,339 --> 00:49:28,884
Just walk me through it.

547
00:49:31,261 --> 00:49:33,138
What I told you already?

548
00:49:34,514 --> 00:49:35,515
Yes.

549
00:49:39,186 --> 00:49:42,314
Fine. I picked up the money
from your cousins.

550
00:49:42,397 --> 00:49:45,442
It was right where
you told me it would be.

551
00:49:45,525 --> 00:49:49,071
Driving back, my car crapped out.

552
00:49:49,154 --> 00:49:53,158
It was about six or seven miles
from the pick-up site.

553
00:49:53,241 --> 00:49:55,285
There's no phone service.

554
00:49:55,369 --> 00:49:57,663
So I walked north.

555
00:49:57,746 --> 00:49:59,665
Through the desert all night.

556
00:49:59,748 --> 00:50:01,583
Well, I slept a little.

557
00:50:01,667 --> 00:50:06,046
But then in the morning, I walked again,
until I made it to a truck stop.

558
00:50:06,129 --> 00:50:08,382
I went into the bathroom and cleaned up.

559
00:50:08,465 --> 00:50:12,719
I bought some clothes, and I called a cab.

560
00:50:12,803 --> 00:50:16,181
And delivered the money,
took them a couple of hours to count it.

561
00:50:17,182 --> 00:50:20,435
Usual rigmarole, and then I saw you.

562
00:50:29,194 --> 00:50:30,737
Tell me again.

563
00:50:32,364 --> 00:50:33,365
What?

564
00:50:34,408 --> 00:50:37,786
Tell me again.

565
00:50:49,673 --> 00:50:55,971
I picked up the money
from those two fine gentlemen.

566
00:50:56,972 --> 00:51:01,059
My car broke down after
about just 10 minutes.

567
00:51:01,143 --> 00:51:03,061
There's no phone service.

568
00:51:03,145 --> 00:51:07,691
And I was afraid to hitchhike
because of how much money was.

569
00:51:08,692 --> 00:51:11,945
And I ran out of water.

570
00:51:12,028 --> 00:51:14,740
So I had to drink my own pee.

571
00:51:16,116 --> 00:51:19,703
A lot of it. So you wanted details,
there you go.

572
00:51:19,786 --> 00:51:23,457
And then I finally
made it to a truck stop.

573
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:26,334
I called a cab. Then I waited.

574
00:51:26,418 --> 00:51:29,171
And then he took me
directly to the courthouse.

575
00:51:29,254 --> 00:51:30,756
I paid your bail and I got you out.

576
00:51:30,839 --> 00:51:34,259
I'm not sure what you're looking
for here, but...

577
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:36,887
there you go.

578
00:51:40,599 --> 00:51:42,476
I just wanna hear the story.

579
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:48,732
Lalo, this is exactly what he told me,
so if you could just...

580
00:51:53,236 --> 00:51:55,530
I just like to hear the story.

581
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:57,783
I mean...

582
00:51:59,868 --> 00:52:02,579
I paid a lot of money for that story,

583
00:52:02,662 --> 00:52:05,248
so I think I can hear it
as much as I want.

584
00:52:15,425 --> 00:52:16,843
So...

585
00:52:19,095 --> 00:52:20,597
tell me again.

586
00:52:25,644 --> 00:52:29,022
I picked up two big bags of money.

587
00:52:29,105 --> 00:52:31,525
Seven million dollars.

588
00:52:32,526 --> 00:52:35,779
Two heavy, heavy bags
that you paid me to get.

589
00:52:37,239 --> 00:52:40,367
I put them in the trunk of my car.

590
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:44,037
And about 10 minutes later,

591
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,373
my car's engine went.

592
00:52:46,456 --> 00:52:50,961
I tried to fix it
but it was overheated or something.

593
00:52:51,044 --> 00:52:56,132
So I walked north through the desert.
I walked and I walked and I walked,

594
00:52:56,216 --> 00:52:59,052
with those heavy, heavy bags.

595
00:53:00,053 --> 00:53:04,808
I walked and I walked and I walked,
and I finally made it to a truck stop.

596
00:53:04,891 --> 00:53:06,560
And I went right to the bathroom,

597
00:53:06,643 --> 00:53:09,062
and I stuck my head under the faucet,

598
00:53:09,145 --> 00:53:11,898
and I bought
a giant pack of energy drinks,

599
00:53:11,982 --> 00:53:14,818
and I called a taxi, and I waited.

600
00:53:16,987 --> 00:53:19,364
I don't know what the problem is, but...

601
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:22,868
can she leave here?

602
00:53:22,951 --> 00:53:24,786
She doesn't need to be here.

603
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:27,914
She had nothing to do with it.
It was me.

604
00:53:27,998 --> 00:53:29,541
It was all me.

605
00:53:30,542 --> 00:53:33,169
- It was all you, huh?
- Yeah.

606
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:39,301
What'd you do, Saul?

607
00:53:40,385 --> 00:53:42,220
Whatever you think I did.

608
00:53:43,597 --> 00:53:46,933
- I don't really know. I just...
- I saw your car.

609
00:53:49,477 --> 00:53:52,689
- Okay.
- You push it in a ditch?

610
00:53:52,772 --> 00:53:54,524
I what?

611
00:53:54,608 --> 00:53:57,277
Did you push it in a ditch?

612
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:01,364
- I don't think so.
- You don't think so?

613
00:54:01,448 --> 00:54:04,284
Well, I mean,
you either did or you didn't.

614
00:54:04,367 --> 00:54:07,454
So which one is it?

615
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:13,126
I don't know what you want.
Do you want the money back?

616
00:54:13,209 --> 00:54:15,921
Because it's in a bag in the other room.
You can take it.

617
00:54:16,004 --> 00:54:18,340
I just want what happened.

618
00:54:18,423 --> 00:54:21,092
- I told you what happened.
- Did you?

619
00:54:23,011 --> 00:54:24,638
Look, okay...

620
00:54:24,721 --> 00:54:26,890
Are you...
Are you kidding me with this?

621
00:54:26,973 --> 00:54:29,517
- Kim...
- Do you know what he did for you?

622
00:54:29,601 --> 00:54:32,020
Seven million dollars of your money.

623
00:54:32,103 --> 00:54:36,232
He hauled it across a goddamn desert
without one penny missing.

624
00:54:36,316 --> 00:54:38,652
And he got you out of jail
for a murder that,

625
00:54:38,735 --> 00:54:40,987
let's face it,
you're definitely guilty of.

626
00:54:41,071 --> 00:54:42,906
He did everything you asked.

627
00:54:42,989 --> 00:54:47,494
And went way beyond what any other lawyer
would ever do.

628
00:54:47,577 --> 00:54:50,038
So, what exactly is it
that you're getting at?

629
00:54:50,121 --> 00:54:51,790
What do you want?

630
00:54:56,461 --> 00:54:58,546
I found his car in a ravine.

631
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,132
Bullet holes on the side.

632
00:55:02,467 --> 00:55:06,513
So I'm just waiting to hear
how that happened.

633
00:55:09,641 --> 00:55:10,850
Bullet holes.

634
00:55:13,395 --> 00:55:14,604
That's it?

635
00:55:15,981 --> 00:55:19,150
Look, I don't know what it's like
where you're from.

636
00:55:19,234 --> 00:55:20,527
But here in New Mexico,

637
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:23,363
you leave a soda can out,
someone's taking a shot at it.

638
00:55:23,446 --> 00:55:26,491
That... That's what you're on about?

639
00:55:26,574 --> 00:55:29,160
You don't think it's possible
a couple of yahoos with guns

640
00:55:29,244 --> 00:55:31,913
shot up a piece of junk car
and then rolled it down in a ditch?

641
00:55:31,997 --> 00:55:33,415
End of story?

642
00:55:34,958 --> 00:55:38,253
What kind of operation
are you running anyway?

643
00:55:38,336 --> 00:55:39,713
Tell me.

644
00:55:39,796 --> 00:55:42,799
Because I think I know why you sent him
to do this job.

645
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,385
It's obvious.

646
00:55:45,468 --> 00:55:48,471
You have no one else you can trust.

647
00:55:49,472 --> 00:55:50,640
Right?

648
00:55:50,724 --> 00:55:55,687
So you sent some lawyer through the desert
with your 7 million bucks?

649
00:55:55,770 --> 00:56:00,567
That... I... No offence,
but you need to get your house in order.

650
00:56:01,568 --> 00:56:04,821
- Oh, really?
- Yeah. Really.

651
00:56:04,904 --> 00:56:07,157
If you don't trust your men
with your money,

652
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:10,493
you have bigger problems
than if you trust Saul Goodman.

653
00:56:12,704 --> 00:56:15,081
And for the record, he doesn't lie.

654
00:56:15,165 --> 00:56:19,627
Not to me. Not to his clients.
He's telling you the truth.

655
00:56:21,337 --> 00:56:24,841
But next time you have a bunch of money
and no one you can trust,

656
00:56:24,924 --> 00:56:26,885
leave him out of it. Okay?

657
00:56:26,968 --> 00:56:29,054
Try a wire transfer.

658
00:56:29,137 --> 00:56:31,765
Try a shell company, or...

659
00:56:31,848 --> 00:56:33,641
You've heard of the Cayman Islands, right?

660
00:56:33,725 --> 00:56:36,019
Jesus, get your shit together.

661
00:56:36,102 --> 00:56:41,024
And stop torturing the one man
who went through hell to save your ass.

662
00:57:59,769 --> 00:58:01,229
What now?

663
00:58:03,106 --> 00:58:04,691
Mexico.

664
00:58:08,027 --> 00:58:09,946
Back to the same place?

665
00:58:10,989 --> 00:58:14,450
Nope. Change of plans.

666
00:58:19,706 --> 00:58:21,833
Come on, Ignacio, go.

667
00:58:21,916 --> 00:58:25,211
We got a long way ahead of us.
