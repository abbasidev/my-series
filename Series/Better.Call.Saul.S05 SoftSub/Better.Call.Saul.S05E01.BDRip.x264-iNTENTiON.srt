00:01:27,464 --> 00:01:30,633

00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:50,653
Black Ford Mustang
on sidewalk at Barnham Hill.

4
00:01:50,737 --> 00:01:54,240

took off on foot.

00:01:55,408 --> 00:01:58,411

00:01:58,495 --> 00:02:00,205

Noise complaint, 61352 Harrison.

8
00:02:26,898 --> 00:02:28,900
French toast didn't work out, huh?

9
00:02:32,195 --> 00:02:33,571
Oh, yeah.

10
00:02:34,948 --> 00:02:35,990
That's fine.

11
00:02:37,283 --> 00:02:38,785
I can warm it up for you.

12
00:02:39,786 --> 00:02:42,497
It's... It's okay.

13
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,208
Well, I can get you something else.
We're serving lunch now.

14
00:02:46,668 --> 00:02:48,461
I'm good. Really.

15
00:02:50,964 --> 00:02:53,091
Can I at least freshen that for you?

16
00:02:57,554 --> 00:02:58,930
Yeah...

17
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,391
Thanks.

18
00:03:05,478 --> 00:03:08,231
Hi, Molly. It's me, Gene.

19
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:11,317
This is your cell number.
I'm sorry about that.

20
00:03:12,402 --> 00:03:15,280
Yeah, I'm fine. It was a false alarm.

21
00:03:15,363 --> 00:03:18,199
You know,
turns out I was just dehydrated.

22
00:03:18,283 --> 00:03:20,243
So, can you believe it?

23
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:24,205
Yeah, I definitely will.

24
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:29,919
Hey, I won't be back for...

25
00:03:30,003 --> 00:03:31,588
Well, till Thursday.

26
00:03:31,671 --> 00:03:34,048
Can you and Frederica open?

27
00:03:35,508 --> 00:03:36,551
Good.

28
00:03:36,634 --> 00:03:42,724
And, also I think you're gonna have
to sign for a delivery this afternoon.

29
00:03:43,892 --> 00:03:47,145
Oh, you did already.
Great, thank you.

30
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:52,650
And has anybody been asking about me?

31
00:03:52,734 --> 00:03:57,822
You know, I mean, like, any customers
come to the store looking for me?

32
00:03:57,906 --> 00:03:59,699
Somebody hanging around or...?

33
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:06,372
No, no. Nothing wrong. I just...

34
00:04:06,456 --> 00:04:09,667
I got some calls
from an insurance salesman.

35
00:04:09,751 --> 00:04:12,086
You know, pushy type, so...

36
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:15,298
So nobody at all?

37
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:21,930
No? Well, that's it then.

38
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:26,851
Yeah, sure. I will.

39
00:04:26,935 --> 00:04:30,605
And, I will see you in a few days.

40
00:04:30,688 --> 00:04:32,482
Thanks, Molly. Yeah.

41
00:04:40,615 --> 00:04:42,375
Nine-fifty three down at the warehouse

42
00:04:42,408 --> 00:04:44,535

00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:52,710
District is 1094 Aurora Drive.

44
00:04:52,794 --> 00:04:55,338

Vehicle parking complaint.

Ten-23.

47
00:05:22,991 --> 00:05:26,619
There's a juvenile.
White male, about 4'8", 70 pounds.

48
00:05:26,703 --> 00:05:31,249
Ten-28 arrived home. That'd be 0700.

49
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:32,417
Ten-23.

00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,128
Gunshot on Sixty-fifth and Seventieth.

51
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:38,423
Our callers may or may not make it...

52
00:06:09,454 --> 00:06:13,666
<i>Welcome to my world</i>

53
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:20,465
<i>Won't you come on in?</i>

54
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:23,676
<i>Miracles, I guess</i>

55
00:06:26,888 --> 00:06:31,267
<i>Still happen now and then</i>

56
00:06:33,144 --> 00:06:37,732
<i>Step into my heart</i>

57
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:44,197
<i>Leave your cares behind</i>

58
00:06:45,198 --> 00:06:49,660
<i>Welcome to my world</i>

59
00:06:50,995 --> 00:06:57,995
<i>Welcome to my world</i>

60
00:07:08,346 --> 00:07:09,889
Hey!

61
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:12,265
Hey.

62
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:17,355
It is you. I thought it was you.

63
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:20,149
I wasn't all the way sure,
but now that I'm seeing you up close,

64
00:07:20,233 --> 00:07:22,819
sure, it's you.

65
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:30,785
Come on, man.
I just want to say hi. I'm a big fan.

66
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:33,496
Back in the day, when I lived
in Albuquerque with my ex,

67
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:35,748
I used to see you everywhere.

68
00:07:35,832 --> 00:07:40,711
You were on the billboards, on the TV,
I used to have one of your matchbooks.

69
00:07:40,795 --> 00:07:42,964
You got me mixed up with someone.

70
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:46,801
My name is Takavic, Gene Takavic.

71
00:07:46,884 --> 00:07:50,972
Sorry, I'm gonna...
I got to get back to work.

72
00:07:51,055 --> 00:07:54,725
Come on, man. That is not cool.

73
00:07:54,809 --> 00:07:59,188
I know who you are. You know who you are.
Let's just get past that.

74
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:07,113
Don't worry about him. He's cool.
He just wanted to come along.

75
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:09,490
Hey, you know who I had in my cab once?

76
00:08:09,574 --> 00:08:11,951
Sammy Hagar.

77
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:14,120
He's even more famous than you.

78
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,582
What do you want?

79
00:08:20,126 --> 00:08:21,794
I just want you to admit it.

80
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:28,676
- I don't know what you're...
- Sure you do.

81
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:31,052
Just say it.

82
00:08:33,723 --> 00:08:37,476
I... I really don't know what...

83
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,560
Come on.

84
00:08:43,274 --> 00:08:44,274
Come on.

85
00:08:46,444 --> 00:08:47,444
Come on, man.

86
00:08:48,863 --> 00:08:51,824
Say it.

87
00:08:58,748 --> 00:09:00,666
Better call Saul.

88
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,251
What?

89
00:09:02,335 --> 00:09:04,086
I... I can't even hear that.

90
00:09:06,422 --> 00:09:07,757
Better call Saul.

91
00:09:09,717 --> 00:09:12,428
Once again and do the point.

92
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:17,391
Better call Saul.

93
00:09:18,935 --> 00:09:20,144
There we go.

94
00:09:21,729 --> 00:09:24,941
Little rusty,
but you'll do better next time.

95
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:32,198
You didn't ask, but the name's Jeff.

96
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:37,787
Any time you need me,

97
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,206
you just call up Omaha United Cabs.

98
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:42,625
You ask for me, they'll find me,
no matter where I'm at.

99
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,710
Never more than five minutes away.

100
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:50,341
Oh, man. It's great to meet you.

101
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:52,717
It's an honour.

102
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,596
All right, I'll see you.

103
00:09:57,098 --> 00:09:58,098
Gene.

104
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,460
505...

105
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:29,380
424.

106
00:10:30,673 --> 00:10:33,676
Please deposit an additional 50 cents.

107
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:54,113
Best Quality Vacuum, how may I help you?

108
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:59,410
Yeah, I need an adaptor for a Hoover
MaxExtract Pressure-Pro, model 60.

109
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,625
We've delivered to you before, haven't we?

110
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:09,378
Yeah, I'm in Omaha, Nebraska.

111
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:13,507
Mr. Takavic...

112
00:11:16,302 --> 00:11:21,390
That will be a very difficult part
to obtain.

113
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:26,604
And I wanna warn you it's gonna be
more expensive than the original.

114
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:30,358
- How expensive?
- Double the price.

115
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:35,154
And we are still in
a cash-on-delivery situation...

116
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:36,822
Will that be a problem?

117
00:11:36,906 --> 00:11:39,825
No, no, it's fine.

118
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:44,663
- How hot are you?
- I got made.

119
00:11:45,748 --> 00:11:47,666
You got made? All right.

120
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:52,129
- Any official involvement?
- No, not yet.

121
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:57,593
Pickup is going to be
in the same place you were dropped off.

122
00:11:57,676 --> 00:12:00,137
Do you remember where that is?

123
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:01,555
Yeah, I do.

124
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:06,936
All right, Mr. Takavic.

125
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:09,687
Thursday.

126
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,441
Seven a.m.

127
00:12:13,818 --> 00:12:14,902
Same spot.

128
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:18,697
You know the rest, am I right?

129
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:24,662
Mr. Takavic?

130
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:29,666
Still there?

131
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:34,463
I've changed my mind.

132
00:12:35,548 --> 00:12:38,259
- Changed your mind?
- Yeah.

133
00:12:39,552 --> 00:12:43,973
To be clear,
you are not going forward with this?

134
00:12:46,684 --> 00:12:48,769
I'm gonna fix it myself.

135
00:14:04,637 --> 00:14:05,553
- Jimmy.
- Kim.

136
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:07,224
- What are you...?
- Listen.

137
00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:11,018
I know this seems fast.
It is fast, but I can see it.

138
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:12,853
- You're changing your name?
- No!

139
00:14:12,937 --> 00:14:16,857
- Well, yes, but it's for my clients.
- You're gonna call yourself Saul Goodman?

140
00:14:16,941 --> 00:14:19,902
I'm already calling myself Saul Goodman.
We've talked about this.

141
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:23,697
The skells who've been buying my phones,
sure as shooting, sooner or later,

142
00:14:23,781 --> 00:14:26,909
every last one of them is gonna find
themselves in the back of a squad car.

143
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:30,204
How do I get them to call Jimmy McGill?
I don't.

144
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:34,250
I stay Saul Goodman,
they call the guy they already know.

145
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:37,211
I thought I was wasting a year of my life.

146
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:40,089
It wasn't a waste. It was for this.
This is it.

147
00:14:40,172 --> 00:14:43,509
- When did you decide...?
- Just now! Back there! Boom! It hit me!

148
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:46,470
This is the way. Kim, it's gonna work.

149
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:49,181
- I...
- I know, I know.

150
00:14:49,265 --> 00:14:53,102
All of a sudden, I've got it
all figured out. But I... I do.

151
00:14:53,185 --> 00:14:54,812
This is right.

152
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:59,525
So let me just... I'll get this done,
and then we can talk about it, okay?

153
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:02,068
I mean...

154
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:06,865
Unless, is there some angle
that I'm not seeing here?

155
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:11,161
If you want me to slow my roll,
I can come back and do this another day.

156
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:17,543
- If this is how you're really feeling...
- It is.

157
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:20,754
- I say sure.
- Great. Five minutes max.

158
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:25,593
Okay, where were we?

159
00:15:25,676 --> 00:15:28,470
Just that you need to sign the documents
with your legal name.

160
00:15:28,554 --> 00:15:32,558
- You got it.
- All that's left is the notice of entry.

161
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:38,105
Jimmy Saul Goodman...

162
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,190
McGill.

163
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:46,071
Thank you, honey.

164
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:53,537
Werner Ziegler. Werner Ziegler.

165
00:15:53,621 --> 00:15:56,206
Werner Ziegler.

166
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,167
Ziegler.

167
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:03,839
You know how many Werner Zieglers
there are in Germany?

168
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:05,382
Twenty-seven.

169
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:08,844
Twenty-six now, according to Mrs. Ziegler.

170
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:13,891
I told you, I never heard of the guy.

171
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,268
What about Michael?

172
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,398
Like I said, I only know the names
of two guys over there.

173
00:16:21,482 --> 00:16:24,193
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Victor and Tyrus.

174
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:27,403
You.

175
00:16:28,864 --> 00:16:31,325
- Yeah?
- Werner Ziegler, ever heard of that guy?

176
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:33,952
Werner Ziegler?

177
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:36,497
No.

178
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:40,376
What about Michael?
He's a bald gringo. He's in the game.

179
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:45,255
Okay.

180
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:49,968
- You're good.
- Okay.

181
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:56,850
South wall pouring concrete?

182
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:01,897
What's he up to, man?
What's he doing?

183
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:07,778
So there's nothing new going on, huh?
Nothing different?

184
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:12,533
- Like what?
- Like anything.

185
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:18,329
What?

186
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:25,129
It's nothing.

187
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,051
It's nothing, man.

188
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:34,513
Couple of skells on Fourth have been
complaining that this stuff is stepped on.

189
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:36,098
Stepped on?

190
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:38,183
You hear that too?

191
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:41,937
They say it's different.

192
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,149
- Different how?
- Skells complain. It's what they do.

193
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,320
Okay.

194
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:53,574
Show me.

195
00:18:03,876 --> 00:18:07,129
Arlo, my man!

196
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:11,216
- Yeah?
- Three.

197
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,676
Let's see what you got.

198
00:19:10,818 --> 00:19:11,818
Hey!

199
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:14,196
Wait!

200
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:17,157
Yo, vato! Yo!

201
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:19,535
Yo, vato, where you going?

202
00:19:19,618 --> 00:19:21,578
You're not going in there.

203
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:22,662
Yo!

204
00:19:37,469 --> 00:19:38,637
Mouse, it's okay.

205
00:20:00,576 --> 00:20:01,827
So where's the stuff?

206
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,293
It's in the chair.

207
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:21,430
What, this chair?

208
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:46,914
This about the count?
Because the count is good.

209
00:20:48,457 --> 00:20:49,708
You're holding cash?

210
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:53,068
Yeah, I got it all right here.

211
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:56,423
If you're holding my cash...

212
00:20:57,758 --> 00:21:00,218
what are you doing up here with my stuff?

213
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:19,571
No one's stepping on it, man.

214
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:33,794
We pick the stuff from the chicken farm,
we cut it, we split it and it lands here.

215
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:35,295
I'm with it all the way.

216
00:21:36,838 --> 00:21:38,632
At his chicken farm...

217
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:41,301
you pick it up how?

218
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:47,516
He puts out 10 keys, I pick six.

219
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:48,850
How do you pick them?

220
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:53,605
I just pick different ones each time.
They're all the same.

221
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:58,652
Okay, so these...

222
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:01,029
These are okay.

223
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:03,865
But these...

224
00:22:15,794 --> 00:22:17,337
This shit's not ours, man.

225
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:29,307
This is old-school beautiful.

226
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,394
Yeah, you deserve it.

227
00:22:32,477 --> 00:22:36,398
- But JMM.
- Yeah.

228
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:39,985
Sorry about that. I didn't know.
I got it for Jimmy McGill.

229
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:42,195
Yeah, well, Jimmy loves it.

230
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:44,281
And don't worry, I'm using it.

231
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:49,202
If anybody says anything,
I'll just say JMM is my motto.

232
00:22:49,286 --> 00:22:50,829
- Your motto?
- Yeah.

233
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,123
Justice...

234
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:57,919
matters most.

235
00:22:58,003 --> 00:22:59,421
That's nice.

236
00:22:59,504 --> 00:23:01,798
There's also this.

237
00:23:06,928 --> 00:23:07,928
Oh, yeah.

238
00:23:09,473 --> 00:23:12,642
World's second best lawyer. Again.

239
00:23:12,726 --> 00:23:15,228
That's the real mistake.
World's second best lawyer.

240
00:23:15,312 --> 00:23:19,149
Because Saul Goodman is gonna give you
a run for your money.

241
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:20,232
Bet he will.

242
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:24,278
Thank you.

243
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:27,282
For everything.

244
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:29,867
Really.

245
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:37,208
You know what?

246
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:40,420
The real trick is gonna be
to get my clients to know

247
00:23:40,504 --> 00:23:42,464
that the cell-phone guy is now a lawyer.

248
00:23:42,547 --> 00:23:45,884
- Their lawyer.
- Yep, that'll be a trick.

249
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:52,390
What I'm thinking is,

250
00:23:52,474 --> 00:23:55,185
see, I've still got almost a full pallet
of cell phones left,

251
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:57,604
so why not run a promotion?

252
00:23:57,687 --> 00:24:01,525
I'll make a real event out of it.
I'll give them away, okay?

253
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:04,820
And for added sweetener,

254
00:24:04,903 --> 00:24:07,072
limited time only,

255
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:11,368
non-violent felonies, 50 percent off.

256
00:24:12,661 --> 00:24:17,541
You know, just like commit
four felonies, you get the fifth one free.

257
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:21,837
And there will be friends and family too,
so you can share them around.

258
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,920
Really?

259
00:24:24,131 --> 00:24:25,298
Yeah. I mean, it's just...

260
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:29,970
Get people in the door,
once they're hooked, I will upsell them.

261
00:24:30,053 --> 00:24:34,724
Doesn't that sound like you're encouraging
these people to commit crimes?

262
00:24:34,808 --> 00:24:37,686
They don't need encouragement.
Believe me.

263
00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:40,522
- One scoop or two?
- One.

264
00:24:40,605 --> 00:24:43,942
Kim, you don't know these assholes
like I do.

265
00:24:44,025 --> 00:24:46,987
Rain or shine, these morons
will be out there doing stupid shit

266
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,780
and getting arrested for it.

267
00:24:48,864 --> 00:24:50,866
Little discount won't make
a bit of difference.

268
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:53,160
Do you want sprinkles?
Because I'm having sprinkles.

269
00:24:53,243 --> 00:24:55,120
Sure.

270
00:24:55,203 --> 00:24:58,707
I'm just worried
about how this reflects on you.

271
00:25:02,377 --> 00:25:04,588
You know what, when you're right,
you're right.

272
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:09,134
What am I doing cutting prices?
Discount is a desperation move.

273
00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:15,473
See?

274
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:19,728
This is why this works.
I go too far, and you pull me back.

275
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,818
Don't you think
you're selling yourself short?

276
00:25:26,902 --> 00:25:29,905
You worked so hard
to get your licence back.

277
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:31,740
We worked.

278
00:25:31,823 --> 00:25:33,742
We worked, so why be...?

279
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:37,120
Why...? Why this?

280
00:25:37,204 --> 00:25:38,622
It's perfect.

281
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:41,833
They already know me, I know them.
What's not to love?

282
00:25:50,258 --> 00:25:53,094
Kim, I can't go back
to being Jimmy McGill.

283
00:25:56,431 --> 00:26:00,977
Jimmy McGill, the lawyer, is always
gonna be Chuck McGill's loser brother.

284
00:26:01,061 --> 00:26:04,105
I'm done with that.
That name is burned.

285
00:26:05,857 --> 00:26:08,818
This is a fresh start.
This is how I move forward.

286
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:10,362
And I like it.

287
00:26:16,243 --> 00:26:19,120
Sorry, it's... I just can't see it.

288
00:26:21,164 --> 00:26:22,958
It's okay.

289
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:24,041
You will.

290
00:27:11,381 --> 00:27:12,924
Did I keep you waiting?

291
00:27:13,925 --> 00:27:16,928
I was admiring Gustavo's establishment.

292
00:27:17,012 --> 00:27:19,931
It's tremendous.

293
00:27:20,015 --> 00:27:21,516
So many trucks.

294
00:27:25,603 --> 00:27:28,440
Are all those buildings
really full of chickens?

295
00:27:28,523 --> 00:27:29,566
Please sit.

296
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:32,819
There's a serious matter to discuss.

297
00:27:38,283 --> 00:27:39,492
Of course, Don Juan.

298
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:49,794
You may have noticed
that some of the product is altered.

299
00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:52,756
Gustavo will explain.

300
00:27:56,259 --> 00:27:58,511
I have a confession to make.

301
00:28:00,347 --> 00:28:05,018
A man was working for me
on the legitimate side of my business.

302
00:28:06,895 --> 00:28:09,898
He was supervising a construction project.

303
00:28:09,981 --> 00:28:11,733
A German engineer.

304
00:28:11,816 --> 00:28:14,861
I think you know his name.

305
00:28:14,944 --> 00:28:16,321
Werner Ziegler.

306
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:23,203
But through an oversight, Ziegler
became aware of our other activities.

307
00:28:23,286 --> 00:28:26,414
The temptation was too great
for him to resist

308
00:28:26,498 --> 00:28:28,333
and he stole two keys of product.

309
00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:31,920
I believe you know the rest of the story.

310
00:28:32,003 --> 00:28:35,924
You know of Ziegler's escape,
you know that my man tracked him down.

311
00:28:37,258 --> 00:28:39,219
My shame...

312
00:28:40,678 --> 00:28:43,431
is not simply that I allowed this
to happen...

313
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:46,351
it's that I hid the truth.

314
00:28:46,434 --> 00:28:48,812
When I discovered what Ziegler had done,

315
00:28:48,895 --> 00:28:53,608
I replaced the stolen product
with methamphetamine I purchased locally.

316
00:28:53,691 --> 00:28:57,737
Some of this inferior product went
to your organisation.

317
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:00,824
And for that...

318
00:29:02,075 --> 00:29:04,577
I must apologise.

319
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:07,705
Sincerely.

320
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,810
What construction project?

321
00:29:30,979 --> 00:29:34,816
I mean, you said
the German was building something.

322
00:29:37,318 --> 00:29:38,318
What?

323
00:29:43,324 --> 00:29:45,910
It would be simpler for me to show you.

324
00:29:54,586 --> 00:29:55,795
When finished,

325
00:29:55,879 --> 00:30:00,216
this will be the most advanced
in-line chilling system in the Southwest.

326
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,343
- A chicken freezer?
- Chiller.

327
00:30:02,427 --> 00:30:04,679
Our product is never frozen.

328
00:30:05,972 --> 00:30:09,559
These are Ziegler's men,
working from his plans.

329
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:13,146
As far as they're concerned,
their leader has gone home.

330
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:26,951
Nothing was keeping you
from sharing all this.

331
00:30:27,035 --> 00:30:28,828
A lot of trouble could have been avoided.

332
00:30:28,912 --> 00:30:32,207
Yes, there were any number
of misunderstandings.

333
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:34,667
My man didn't know who was following him,

334
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:39,214
and as a result, he went to great lengths
to conceal his activities.

335
00:30:39,297 --> 00:30:41,216
Your man...

336
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:42,592
Michael, is that right?

337
00:30:43,718 --> 00:30:44,718
Yes.

338
00:30:47,096 --> 00:30:49,682
That's not him, is it?

339
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:51,434
It is.

340
00:30:51,518 --> 00:30:53,937
Well, I'd love to say hello
if that's permitted.

341
00:30:55,813 --> 00:30:56,940
Most certainly.

342
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,532
Michael.

343
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:26,219
Michael, please meet
my associate, Eduardo.

344
00:31:35,853 --> 00:31:38,648
What a pleasure.
I've heard so much about you.

345
00:31:40,817 --> 00:31:42,902
- That right?
- Oh, yes.

346
00:31:47,115 --> 00:31:49,158
I'm gonna get back to it.

347
00:31:49,242 --> 00:31:50,285
Thank you, Michael.

348
00:31:51,327 --> 00:31:52,328
Well...

349
00:31:53,913 --> 00:31:55,582
That explains everything.

350
00:31:55,665 --> 00:31:58,585
- I'm glad you are satisfied.
- Listen to me.

351
00:32:00,044 --> 00:32:02,422
There must be no more trouble.

352
00:32:02,505 --> 00:32:06,593
You two must coexist.
This is non-negotiable.

353
00:32:06,676 --> 00:32:09,095
Gustavo, there can be no more secrets.

354
00:32:09,178 --> 00:32:10,805
Yes.

355
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:12,765
Don Eladio is not happy.

356
00:32:13,766 --> 00:32:16,519
Do you understand what I'm telling you?

357
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:17,603
I do.

358
00:32:18,896 --> 00:32:20,273
Then we're done.

359
00:32:24,902 --> 00:32:28,781
You know, it's gonna be
a very nice chiller.

360
00:32:30,867 --> 00:32:32,827
South wall's gonna look beautiful.

361
00:32:44,047 --> 00:32:45,840
Why are you in the North?

362
00:32:45,923 --> 00:32:48,509
To protect my family's interests.

363
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:53,181
Following Gustavo's men?
Spying on him?

364
00:32:53,264 --> 00:32:56,309
And this business at TravelWire.
Messy.

365
00:32:56,392 --> 00:32:59,771
This is not how we conduct ourselves
this side of the border.

366
00:32:59,854 --> 00:33:03,316
Look. I apologise.
It's my uncle's influence.

367
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:05,234
You know what Hector's like.

368
00:33:05,318 --> 00:33:07,695
So suspicious, so unreasonable.

369
00:33:09,197 --> 00:33:13,159
Hector has this crazy idea in his head

370
00:33:13,242 --> 00:33:16,287
that somehow, the chicken man

371
00:33:16,371 --> 00:33:19,290
might carry a grudge after he shot
Fring's boyfriend in the head.

372
00:33:21,376 --> 00:33:25,713
You don't understand Gustavo.
With him, it's all business.

373
00:33:27,173 --> 00:33:28,341
All business?

374
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:32,679
Like what happened in Santiago?
Was that business too?

375
00:33:35,098 --> 00:33:38,685
I need to know that this is done with.

376
00:33:43,398 --> 00:33:45,608
You trust Fring?

377
00:33:46,776 --> 00:33:50,863
He'll never be one of us, but he earns.

378
00:33:50,947 --> 00:33:55,576
As long as he brings in the dollars,
Eladio is happy.

379
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,954
That's all that matters.

380
00:34:01,457 --> 00:34:03,543
Then there's nothing more to say.

381
00:34:08,131 --> 00:34:10,883
- Give my best to your uncle.
- I will.

382
00:34:29,444 --> 00:34:30,820
Come on. Let's just go.

383
00:34:50,965 --> 00:34:52,133
I see you.

384
00:34:54,802 --> 00:34:56,763
There's plenty of phones for everyone.

385
00:34:56,846 --> 00:34:58,639
Just take it easy.

386
00:35:04,353 --> 00:35:05,688
Back up.

387
00:35:05,772 --> 00:35:07,398
There are plenty of phones.

388
00:35:07,482 --> 00:35:09,567
Plenty of phones.

389
00:35:11,944 --> 00:35:13,988
Sorry, can't help you, ladies.

390
00:35:14,071 --> 00:35:15,865
Everybody got to wait their turn.

391
00:35:17,867 --> 00:35:19,410
Here you go, buddy.

392
00:35:19,494 --> 00:35:21,120
Next.

393
00:35:21,204 --> 00:35:23,331
Welcome, welcome. Take a load off.

394
00:35:23,414 --> 00:35:25,958
Before we talk phones, let's talk you.

395
00:35:26,042 --> 00:35:28,461
I'm guessing from our brief acquaintance

396
00:35:28,544 --> 00:35:32,006
that you are a fella who, occasionally,
through no fault of your own,

397
00:35:32,089 --> 00:35:33,716
finds yourself in a donnybrook or two.

398
00:35:35,468 --> 00:35:39,388
Yeah, a knuckle-duster.
A fistfight.

399
00:35:39,472 --> 00:35:43,017
I'm thinking you might be
someone who partakes

400
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,102
of the herb of the earth.

401
00:35:45,186 --> 00:35:49,482
I'm guessing that you ladies
are popular with the fellas.

402
00:35:49,565 --> 00:35:52,193
And this could lead to a misunderstanding

403
00:35:52,276 --> 00:35:54,237
with the boys in blue.

404
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,197
Say hello to my little friend.

405
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,700
See right there, circled in red?
It's pre-programmed. Ready to go.

406
00:35:59,784 --> 00:36:02,620
Number one on the speed dial
goes directly to me.

407
00:36:02,703 --> 00:36:05,998
You press that, and poof! I'm there.

408
00:36:06,082 --> 00:36:08,459
Next! Why call the cell-phone guy?

409
00:36:08,543 --> 00:36:10,253
Because I'm not just the cell-phone guy,

410
00:36:10,336 --> 00:36:12,630
I'm the lawyer who's gonna fight for you.

411
00:36:12,713 --> 00:36:15,341
You might find yourself
in possession of a few pieces

412
00:36:15,424 --> 00:36:16,801
of military ordnance, you know?

413
00:36:16,884 --> 00:36:20,555
RPGs, maybe a couple
of claymore mines in the trunk.

414
00:36:20,638 --> 00:36:23,766
Before you know it, the other guy
is bleeding out on the pavement

415
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:26,477
and the cops are giving you the evil eye.

416
00:36:26,561 --> 00:36:30,523
It's just that people are always
looking over each other's shoulder.

417
00:36:30,606 --> 00:36:35,027
And you're not hurting anyone,
you know? Who doesn't wanna be...

418
00:36:37,363 --> 00:36:40,241
Next. Big fella outside,
his name's Huell Babineaux.

419
00:36:40,324 --> 00:36:42,952
Go ask Huell about me.
He was facing three years.

420
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:44,453
He was facing six years.

421
00:36:44,537 --> 00:36:46,414
Eight years, down in Guadalupe.

422
00:36:46,497 --> 00:36:50,751
He was facing 25 years.
Didn't do a single day.

423
00:36:50,835 --> 00:36:53,129
That's why he calls me the Magic Man.

424
00:36:53,212 --> 00:36:56,507
I asked him not to call me that,
but he insists. Next!

425
00:36:56,591 --> 00:36:59,218
Number one on the speed dial,
that's your lifeline.

426
00:36:59,302 --> 00:37:01,637
Cops pick you up, threaten you,
look at you sideways,

427
00:37:01,721 --> 00:37:03,848
you press that button and I'm there.

428
00:37:04,807 --> 00:37:06,309
Press number one...

429
00:37:06,392 --> 00:37:08,394
Zip your lip and press the button.

430
00:37:08,477 --> 00:37:11,480
Keep your mouth shut and press number one.
Keep it charged. Poof! Poof!

431
00:37:11,564 --> 00:37:13,190
Poof! I'm there.

432
00:37:13,274 --> 00:37:15,067
At number one on the speed dial.

433
00:37:15,151 --> 00:37:17,695
It's your panic button.
Press one on the speed dial.

434
00:37:17,778 --> 00:37:19,238
Ask him about the Magic Man.

435
00:37:19,322 --> 00:37:20,448
Speedy justice.

436
00:37:20,531 --> 00:37:22,700
Your friend Saul is there,
I got your back.

437
00:37:22,783 --> 00:37:24,577
Twenty-four hours a day,
seven days a week,

438
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:28,456
365 days a year. Press number one.
Speedy justice for you.

439
00:37:28,539 --> 00:37:29,790
Just press one.

440
00:37:29,874 --> 00:37:31,250
Here's your lifeline.

441
00:37:31,334 --> 00:37:32,710
Use in good health.

442
00:37:36,339 --> 00:37:39,926
Press number one and poof!
Saul Goodman is there.

443
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:47,433
Folks, folks.
Ladies and gents, boys and girls.

444
00:37:47,516 --> 00:37:48,976
Due to popular demand,

445
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,938
I'm very sorry to say
we've given out our last phone.

446
00:37:52,021 --> 00:37:56,108
However,
I'm still here for legal consultations.

447
00:37:56,192 --> 00:37:59,028
Free legal consultations.

448
00:37:59,111 --> 00:38:00,863
You know what? At least take a card.

449
00:38:00,947 --> 00:38:03,991
You meet the law, you want the law
to meet me.

450
00:38:04,075 --> 00:38:06,827
You know what? Since none of you
are getting phones tonight,

451
00:38:06,911 --> 00:38:09,789
how about a special discount?

452
00:38:10,831 --> 00:38:12,166
Yeah...

453
00:38:12,249 --> 00:38:14,710
For the next two weeks,

454
00:38:14,794 --> 00:38:20,174
non-violent felonies,
50 percent off. Yeah.

455
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,844
Okay.

456
00:38:23,928 --> 00:38:26,180
- That's for you. Fifty percent off.
- I'll take one.

457
00:38:26,263 --> 00:38:28,033
Yeah, all right, now we got some takers.

458
00:38:28,057 --> 00:38:29,141
There you are.

459
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:32,103
Fifty percent off.

460
00:38:32,186 --> 00:38:34,563
- Remember, 50 percent off. All right.
- For real?

461
00:38:34,647 --> 00:38:38,025
Very good. Oh, yeah, yeah.

462
00:38:38,109 --> 00:38:39,652
Very good.

463
00:38:42,822 --> 00:38:44,740
Well done, Magic Man.

464
00:38:46,283 --> 00:38:47,785
We're just getting started.

465
00:39:21,235 --> 00:39:23,988
If you were gonna die,
you'd be dead already.

466
00:39:24,071 --> 00:39:26,574
Now step out of the truck,
we got things to do.

467
00:39:41,047 --> 00:39:42,047
All right.

468
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:47,261
The job may only be half done,
but you're being paid in full.

469
00:39:47,344 --> 00:39:49,221
Does it need to be said

470
00:39:49,305 --> 00:39:52,808
that your cooperation is expected
to continue?

471
00:39:52,892 --> 00:39:54,935
Permanently.

472
00:39:55,019 --> 00:39:56,353
Not a word.

473
00:39:56,437 --> 00:39:59,607
Not today, not tomorrow,
not next week, not ever.

474
00:40:01,067 --> 00:40:04,653
You let your end down,
there will be consequences.

475
00:40:04,737 --> 00:40:06,906
Is that understood by all?

476
00:40:08,449 --> 00:40:10,201
All right.

477
00:40:10,284 --> 00:40:12,161
Udo and Renke.

478
00:40:12,244 --> 00:40:15,247
You're in the Cherokee. Keys are inside.

479
00:40:15,331 --> 00:40:16,707
You're driving to Denver.

480
00:40:16,791 --> 00:40:19,335
Flight for Zurich leaves at midnight.

481
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:21,003
You hang a right,

482
00:40:21,087 --> 00:40:23,756
you'll hit the main highway in four miles.

483
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:25,549
Passports and tickets.

484
00:40:31,931 --> 00:40:33,265
Kai.

485
00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:35,851
You're travelling solo in the red Pontiac.

486
00:40:35,935 --> 00:40:40,189
You're flying out of Dallas.
It is a long drive.

487
00:40:40,272 --> 00:40:43,484
Flight leaves at 9:40 direct to Berlin.

488
00:40:47,446 --> 00:40:48,989
I will never say anything.

489
00:40:50,116 --> 00:40:51,116
Ever.

490
00:40:56,372 --> 00:40:57,623
It had to be done.

491
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:01,043
He was a good man, but...

492
00:41:02,419 --> 00:41:04,171
in truth he was...

493
00:41:04,255 --> 00:41:05,297
soft.

494
00:41:33,325 --> 00:41:35,077
Casper.

495
00:41:35,161 --> 00:41:36,662
Toyota.

496
00:41:36,745 --> 00:41:39,582
You're headed to Phoenix,
10:15 to Vancouver,

497
00:41:39,665 --> 00:41:41,667
then Vancouver to Budapest.

498
00:41:57,975 --> 00:41:58,975
Yeah?

499
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:05,482
He was worth 50 of you.

500
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:25,085
Sebastian, Adrian.

501
00:42:26,378 --> 00:42:27,421
The Civic.

502
00:42:29,048 --> 00:42:30,799
You're driving to El Paso.

503
00:42:32,593 --> 00:42:36,430
On the 7:25 to Chicago,
then Chicago to Vienna.

504
00:42:58,994 --> 00:43:00,079
Well?

505
00:43:00,162 --> 00:43:03,165
Last of them got on a plane for Zurich
an hour ago.

506
00:43:03,249 --> 00:43:04,291
No problem.

507
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:08,379
Will they do as they've been told?

508
00:43:08,462 --> 00:43:10,881
- You're asking my opinion?
- I am.

509
00:43:12,466 --> 00:43:14,510
They know the consequences.

510
00:43:14,593 --> 00:43:15,719
And the laundry?

511
00:43:15,803 --> 00:43:19,598
The entrances to the site have been
sealed. Nobody's gonna stumble on it.

512
00:43:21,892 --> 00:43:24,436
As long as Lalo Salamanca is
on this side of the border,

513
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,355
we cannot continue as we were.

514
00:43:27,356 --> 00:43:28,691
So this is it?

515
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:33,904
No, this is not it.

516
00:43:33,988 --> 00:43:39,576
Once Salamanca is dealt with,
and he will be dealt with,

517
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,203
construction will resume.

518
00:43:42,454 --> 00:43:46,000
Until then, you will continue to be paid.

519
00:43:48,627 --> 00:43:50,796
Now, you're gonna pay me to do nothing.

520
00:43:52,047 --> 00:43:53,841
Call it a retainer.

521
00:43:54,883 --> 00:43:57,219
- Even after Ziegler?
- Yes.

522
00:44:00,472 --> 00:44:03,100
What happened in Frankfurt?

523
00:44:03,183 --> 00:44:05,728
The attorney spent
a full day with his wife.

524
00:44:06,729 --> 00:44:10,190
She accepted the facts as presented.

525
00:44:12,026 --> 00:44:16,488
As per your suggestion,
a construction accident.

526
00:44:16,572 --> 00:44:20,284
The funeral was yesterday.
And of course...

527
00:44:20,367 --> 00:44:22,036
she has been compensated.

528
00:44:24,788 --> 00:44:26,165
Compensated.

529
00:44:30,294 --> 00:44:34,423
I would choose my next words

530
00:44:34,506 --> 00:44:37,134
very carefully, if I were you.

531
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:46,477
You keep your goddamn retainer.

532
00:45:41,657 --> 00:45:43,575
Mr. Oakley, Mr. Oakley.

533
00:45:43,659 --> 00:45:46,286
Would you care to comment
on the Carl Gravenhorst case?

534
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:47,328
Oh, I...

535
00:45:47,329 --> 00:45:49,915
As you know, the DA's Office has been
accused of misconduct

536
00:45:49,998 --> 00:45:51,125
in the Gravenhorst case.

537
00:45:51,208 --> 00:45:53,419
Would you comment on
the latest development?

538
00:45:53,502 --> 00:45:54,586
The Graven what?

539
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:57,423
People are saying
you're prosecuting an innocent man.

540
00:45:57,506 --> 00:46:00,342
Does the DA's Office
have something to hide?

541
00:46:00,426 --> 00:46:02,511
- Well...
- Excuse me, excuse me.

542
00:46:02,594 --> 00:46:04,054
Please let me through.

543
00:46:04,138 --> 00:46:06,348
That's my client you're talking about.

544
00:46:06,432 --> 00:46:08,142
- And you are?
- I'm Saul Goodman.

545
00:46:08,225 --> 00:46:10,686
And Carl Gravenhorst is
100 percent innocent.

546
00:46:10,769 --> 00:46:13,105
The Albuquerque DA's Office
is perpetrating

547
00:46:13,188 --> 00:46:15,190
an outrageous miscarriage of justice.

548
00:46:15,274 --> 00:46:17,276
- You're who?
- I'm Saul Goodman,

549
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:21,238
and we are counter-suing you
and the entire Albuquerque DA's Office

550
00:46:21,321 --> 00:46:22,739
for malicious persecution,

551
00:46:22,823 --> 00:46:25,325
unlawful detention
and abuse of process.

552
00:46:25,409 --> 00:46:26,409
Seriously?

553
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:28,871
Yeah. We'll take this all the way
to the Supreme Court.

554
00:46:28,954 --> 00:46:30,330
By the time we're through,

555
00:46:30,414 --> 00:46:33,417
Carl Gravenhorst's name will be cleared
and we'll receive a settlement.

556
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,626
A cash settlement.

557
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:38,046
All right, enough.
I've got to be in court.

558
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:40,799
Go if you must. But know this.

559
00:46:40,883 --> 00:46:42,676
We will meet again.

560
00:46:42,759 --> 00:46:45,596
I'm sorry.
What'd you say your name was?

561
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:48,265
I'm Saul Goodman,
and I make it my business

562
00:46:48,348 --> 00:46:53,061
to defend the citizens of Albuquerque
against injustices of every kind.

563
00:46:53,145 --> 00:46:56,023
- Wow, you must be really expensive though.
- Not at all.

564
00:46:56,106 --> 00:46:59,359
I believe every man, woman
and child deserves speedy justice

565
00:46:59,443 --> 00:47:00,736
at a price they can afford.

566
00:47:00,819 --> 00:47:03,989
Do you have a card?
Not for me. For a friend.

567
00:47:04,072 --> 00:47:08,994
Yes. And please tell your friend
that I make no judgements

568
00:47:09,077 --> 00:47:11,872
and I'm available 24 hours a day.

569
00:47:11,955 --> 00:47:14,124
- Can I get one of those, sir?
- Oh, yeah.

570
00:47:15,459 --> 00:47:17,169
- What about me?
- Oh, sure.

571
00:47:18,545 --> 00:47:20,589
Okay.

572
00:47:23,008 --> 00:47:24,551
Yeah, I...

573
00:47:24,635 --> 00:47:26,553
I just don't know.

574
00:47:26,637 --> 00:47:28,597
Five months.

575
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,891
With overcrowding,
you'll probably do less than two.

576
00:47:32,518 --> 00:47:34,311
Yeah. Yeah.

577
00:47:34,394 --> 00:47:35,771
Considering your priors,

578
00:47:35,854 --> 00:47:37,898
sentencing guidelines
would have you looking

579
00:47:37,981 --> 00:47:41,443
at two to four years in custody,
so...

580
00:47:42,486 --> 00:47:44,279
Five months is really good, Bobby.

581
00:47:48,158 --> 00:47:50,869
Are you worried about being there
when Lois delivers?

582
00:47:50,953 --> 00:47:51,995
Delivers?

583
00:47:53,497 --> 00:47:55,582
Oh, right. Yeah, yeah, so...

584
00:47:55,666 --> 00:47:59,253
So if I go to trial,
you'll be my lawyer, right?

585
00:47:59,336 --> 00:48:02,839
- Bobby, you do not want to go to trial.
- But you'll be my lawyer?

586
00:48:02,923 --> 00:48:05,759
Yes, but going to trial
would be a mistake.

587
00:48:05,842 --> 00:48:07,594
Trials are always unpredictable.

588
00:48:07,678 --> 00:48:09,680
At trial,
the DA will throw everything at us.

589
00:48:09,763 --> 00:48:11,974
- You'll be rolling the dice.
- Yeah, roll the dice.

590
00:48:12,057 --> 00:48:15,185
Yeah, I don't mean to tell you
your business, Miss Wexler,

591
00:48:15,269 --> 00:48:18,438
but you put me up there,
I give the people the big eyes,

592
00:48:18,522 --> 00:48:20,274
they see Lois here and the kid.

593
00:48:20,357 --> 00:48:22,568
- They're gonna believe me.
- I'd believe you.

594
00:48:23,819 --> 00:48:27,489
Bobby, there are a million reasons
not to go to trial.

595
00:48:28,907 --> 00:48:30,325
But it's up to me, right?

596
00:48:30,409 --> 00:48:33,662
Yes, it is, but I'm advising you not to.

597
00:48:33,745 --> 00:48:37,374
Odds are, you would end up going away
for more time, not less.

598
00:48:37,457 --> 00:48:39,918
And I'm talking about years of your life.

599
00:48:41,336 --> 00:48:43,839
But I might not. Right?

600
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:47,342
- You don't want to take that risk.
- Maybe I do.

601
00:48:47,426 --> 00:48:48,885
Lois?

602
00:48:48,969 --> 00:48:50,554
Whatever Bobby says.

603
00:48:56,852 --> 00:48:59,187
Excuse me a moment. Please...

604
00:49:00,188 --> 00:49:02,232
think this over carefully.

605
00:49:02,316 --> 00:49:03,316
Both of you.

606
00:49:06,028 --> 00:49:07,446
You ready for lunch?

607
00:49:07,529 --> 00:49:09,882
There's a new sandwich vending machine
down by family court.

608
00:49:09,906 --> 00:49:11,241
I've heard good things.

609
00:49:11,325 --> 00:49:13,160
Sorry, I'm stuck here.

610
00:49:13,243 --> 00:49:15,287
Really? What's up?

611
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:18,081
- He's not taking the deal.
- Who? That guy?

612
00:49:19,374 --> 00:49:21,251
Isn't he the punk who tried to sell

613
00:49:21,335 --> 00:49:24,421
a flatbed of hot mini-fridges
to an undercover cop?

614
00:49:24,504 --> 00:49:25,505
What'd you get him?

615
00:49:25,589 --> 00:49:28,342
- Five months.
- Five months? With his priors?

616
00:49:28,425 --> 00:49:30,385
Well, he should be on his knees
thanking you.

617
00:49:30,469 --> 00:49:32,054
I'm trying to talk him out of trial.

618
00:49:32,137 --> 00:49:33,555
No! Seriously?

619
00:49:33,639 --> 00:49:35,015
Seriously.

620
00:49:35,724 --> 00:49:36,892
You know what?

621
00:49:37,934 --> 00:49:39,186
No.

622
00:49:39,269 --> 00:49:40,687
No, we can fix this.

623
00:49:42,147 --> 00:49:44,941
I'm from the DA's Office, okay?
I'm giving you what for.

624
00:49:45,025 --> 00:49:46,860
You're giving me what for. We'll be loud.

625
00:49:46,943 --> 00:49:50,530
We will go over there,
we will make a scene, okay?

626
00:49:50,614 --> 00:49:52,074
New evidence has come to light,

627
00:49:52,157 --> 00:49:55,285
and I'm pulling his deal
with extreme prejudice.

628
00:49:55,369 --> 00:49:58,997
I'm pissed!
I want to put him away permanently.

629
00:50:00,207 --> 00:50:01,625
They're talking about you.

630
00:50:04,878 --> 00:50:07,506
You fight me, I will push back hard.

631
00:50:07,589 --> 00:50:10,717
We'll have that punk on his knees,
begging for the five months.

632
00:50:14,971 --> 00:50:17,265
- I don't think so.
- Come on, Kim. We can do this.

633
00:50:17,349 --> 00:50:20,102
- Lead-pipe cinch.
- He's the client, it's his decision.

634
00:50:20,185 --> 00:50:23,647
What good is it gonna do,
you put that dweeb away in Los Lunas?

635
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:25,232
You think he's a jackass now?

636
00:50:25,315 --> 00:50:27,859
Wait till he gets back
from that clown college.

637
00:50:27,943 --> 00:50:29,152
Jimmy, no.

638
00:50:29,236 --> 00:50:31,738
What about his wife and kid?
That's them? What about them?

639
00:50:31,822 --> 00:50:34,258
If this isn't using our powers for good,
I don't know what is.

640
00:50:34,282 --> 00:50:36,326
- We're not doing that.
- But, Kim, we could do it!

641
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:38,912
- I'm not scamming my client.
- It worked for Mesa Verde.

642
00:50:38,995 --> 00:50:40,205
Jimmy. Back off.

643
00:50:42,207 --> 00:50:43,458
We can't...

644
00:50:44,292 --> 00:50:45,919
Okay.

645
00:50:51,091 --> 00:50:52,467
Yeah, I'll see you at home.

646
00:51:08,024 --> 00:51:09,651
So...

647
00:51:09,735 --> 00:51:10,735
who was that?

648
00:51:13,989 --> 00:51:15,449
Is everything all right?

649
00:51:21,455 --> 00:51:23,415
He's from the District Attorney's Office.

650
00:51:24,666 --> 00:51:26,418
They're taking the deal off the table.

651
00:51:27,836 --> 00:51:32,549
So what? I mean, we weren't
gonna take it anyway, so...

652
00:51:32,632 --> 00:51:35,135
Miss Wexler,
why are they taking it off the table?

653
00:51:36,219 --> 00:51:37,721
I...

654
00:51:37,804 --> 00:51:39,973
don't know for sure.

655
00:51:40,056 --> 00:51:42,934
It's possible they have new evidence.

656
00:51:47,105 --> 00:51:52,360
Like... Like what?
Like cameras or witnesses? Or...?

657
00:51:52,444 --> 00:51:53,779
I really couldn't say.

658
00:51:55,697 --> 00:51:57,616
We'll find out soon enough.

659
00:51:59,659 --> 00:52:00,952
Bobby, I'm sorry.

660
00:52:02,704 --> 00:52:04,956
It looks like they want
to make an example out of you.

661
00:52:08,835 --> 00:52:10,420
All right, well...

662
00:52:10,504 --> 00:52:13,423
We better go tell the judge
that we're taking this to trial.

663
00:52:13,507 --> 00:52:15,383
Yeah, you know what?

664
00:52:15,467 --> 00:52:18,428
Are you sure
we still can't get the five months?

665
00:52:19,554 --> 00:52:21,515
The DA took that off the table.

666
00:52:21,598 --> 00:52:24,226
You mean if you...
Even if you ask real nice?

667
00:52:29,314 --> 00:52:31,107
I could try.

668
00:52:32,192 --> 00:52:35,403
- Are you sure that's what you want?
- Yeah, I thought about it,

669
00:52:35,487 --> 00:52:37,280
just like you said, and...

670
00:52:37,364 --> 00:52:38,615
I could do the five months.

671
00:52:40,659 --> 00:52:42,536
Miss Wexler, please.

672
00:52:50,794 --> 00:52:52,546
Wait here.

673
00:52:52,629 --> 00:52:55,257
I can't promise anything, but...

674
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:56,967
- I'll look into it.
- Sure, sure.

675
00:52:57,050 --> 00:52:58,218
You do that.

676
00:52:59,553 --> 00:53:00,762
We'll be right here.
