1
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:34,035
Help you find something?

2
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:37,539
No, thanks. I'm just browsing.

3
00:01:12,198 --> 00:01:13,825
That still works.

4
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:15,744
You can plug it in if you want.

5
00:01:15,827 --> 00:01:18,621
Thanks.

6
00:02:37,367 --> 00:02:38,451
How much for this?

7
00:02:39,619 --> 00:02:41,120
That?

8
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:43,456
I could let that go for 30.

9
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:47,669
Seventy-five for all three?

10
00:04:24,934 --> 00:04:26,392
Yeah, don't worry about it.

11
00:04:26,476 --> 00:04:29,687
Building will take care of it.
That's what you pay rent for.

12
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:33,441
What's your day look like?

13
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:37,111
I got MDC in the morning
and court in the afternoon.

14
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:40,531
Oh, and I'm finally doing that lunch
with Howard.

15
00:04:40,615 --> 00:04:41,699
Yeah?

16
00:04:41,783 --> 00:04:43,159
See what he wants.

17
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:45,495
Hopefully it will be short
and sweet. You?

18
00:04:48,498 --> 00:04:50,875
Yesterday was bad.

19
00:04:51,876 --> 00:04:53,962
Today, I'm gonna fix it.

20
00:04:54,045 --> 00:04:55,880
Sounds like a plan.

21
00:04:55,964 --> 00:04:57,465
See you.

22
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:05,181
Pull the initial research
we did on Lot 2375.

23
00:05:06,432 --> 00:05:08,184
Yeah.

24
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:09,936
Yeah, all of it.

25
00:05:11,437 --> 00:05:15,566
Permit status, costs, projections.

26
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:19,237
Are they on digital?

27
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,948
Good. How are you on PowerPoint?

28
00:05:22,615 --> 00:05:25,243
Great. I'll walk you through
what I need when I get in.

29
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:29,122
I should be there in 20.

30
00:05:30,373 --> 00:05:32,333
I'll see you when I get there.

31
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:47,140
You gentlemen have had a busy week, huh?

32
00:05:49,684 --> 00:05:51,519
Bail has been denied.

33
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:53,521
No mystery there.

34
00:05:56,649 --> 00:06:00,653
Okay. Let's start at the beginning.
Somehow, you two are short on priors,

35
00:06:00,737 --> 00:06:05,158
so I think I can get the DA to knock the
drug charges down to simple possession.

36
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:07,785
We can lay responsibility for the felonies

37
00:06:07,869 --> 00:06:10,246
at the doorstep
of your unfortunate dependence

38
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:13,583
on hard drugs, but we're gonna have
to argue for rehab as part of probation...

39
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,293
Hells, no. I hate rehab.

40
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:18,337
All right.
Don't get all in a twist, okay?

41
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:23,676
I've heard that there exist
certain less-than-reputable establishments

42
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:29,057
that will provide certification without
the pleasure of your actual attendance.

43
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,558
You know a place like that?

44
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:33,478
I could conceivably find such a place
for an additional fee.

45
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:35,247
All right,
because I ain't going to no rehab.

46
00:06:35,271 --> 00:06:36,856
You go, you don't go.

47
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:38,524
That's between you and your God.

48
00:06:38,608 --> 00:06:40,318
But you gotta tell the judge you'll go,

49
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:42,779
and you gotta sound like you mean it,
okay?

50
00:06:42,862 --> 00:06:44,614
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

51
00:06:44,697 --> 00:06:47,700
Well, all that's left is your many,
many misdemeanours,

52
00:06:47,784 --> 00:06:51,454
which include graffiti, vandalism,

53
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:54,082
littering, public urination.

54
00:06:55,124 --> 00:06:58,044
Nature's calling you, you gotta answer it.

55
00:06:58,127 --> 00:07:01,964
Hold it too long, you get kidney-stoned.

56
00:07:04,717 --> 00:07:07,929
Be that as it may,
even misdemeanours add up,

57
00:07:08,012 --> 00:07:11,933
so if I can get you concurrent sentences,
you're looking at...

58
00:07:13,476 --> 00:07:15,269
12 months in stir.

59
00:07:15,353 --> 00:07:20,358
Now, with good behaviour and overcrowding,
takes it down to six, maybe five months.

60
00:07:20,441 --> 00:07:21,943
That's minimum security.

61
00:07:22,026 --> 00:07:25,738
It's gonna be like taking a cruise,
only less danger of drowning.

62
00:07:25,822 --> 00:07:27,115
Christ, man, five months?

63
00:07:27,198 --> 00:07:29,325
Down from five years, consecutive,

64
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:32,286
or worse,
if they get this heavy stuff to stick.

65
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:33,371
Now, come on.

66
00:07:33,454 --> 00:07:36,290
You do your months,
you do a little community service,

67
00:07:36,374 --> 00:07:39,919
maybe a year probation,
and you're gold, Ponyboy. Sound good?

68
00:07:41,337 --> 00:07:44,006
Yeah, okay. Yeah, we can take that.

69
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,174
No doubt.

70
00:07:45,258 --> 00:07:48,719
Great. So all that's left is my fee.

71
00:07:48,803 --> 00:07:53,266
Okay, so for my time,
court costs, filing fees,

72
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:56,060
you're looking at, let's say about...

73
00:07:57,562 --> 00:07:59,313
four grand, all-in.

74
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:03,526
- Say what?
- Yo, don't play us like that.

75
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:05,653
What about 50 percent off?

76
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:09,407
That is 50 percent off.
Now, my normal rate would be 4K each.

77
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,492
Dude, this is B.S.

78
00:08:11,576 --> 00:08:14,996
They got lawyers here they gotta give us.
You pay nothing.

79
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:18,457
- Free lawyers?
- Public 'fenders.

80
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:21,294
Four grand,
we can get a lot of scante, man.

81
00:08:21,377 --> 00:08:25,840
I'm sorry. Free lawyer? Are you saying
that you want a free lawyer?

82
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:30,678
- We're just talking over options.
- And, you know, free is, you know, free.

83
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:33,764
Did you ever hear the phrase,
you get what you pay for, you nudnik?

84
00:08:33,848 --> 00:08:36,684
Without me, they're gonna lock you up
and throw away the key.

85
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:39,395
I'm sorry. Did I say five years?

86
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:42,398
You go ahead and play Russian roulette
with a public pretender,

87
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:45,276
you're gonna end up doing a decade
in Los Lunas.

88
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,862
You twerps even know who I am?

89
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:50,281
I am Saul Goodman.

90
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,366
Okay? You think 4K is too much?

91
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:55,870
Yesterday,
I got paid 8K just for the afternoon.

92
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:58,497
That's how good I am.
I am the real deal.

93
00:08:58,581 --> 00:09:00,791
You're lucky I'm even talking to you.

94
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:03,336
You know what?

95
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:07,131
- Hey, come on, man. Don't be like that.
- Hey, all right.

96
00:09:07,215 --> 00:09:08,591
Hey, we're sorry, yo. We're sorry.

97
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:11,177
- You. We... We wanna go with you.
- Hunny-percent.

98
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,012
Please, sir?

99
00:09:16,057 --> 00:09:17,725
Okay.

100
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:20,394
We're back on the same page though.
Payment.

101
00:09:20,478 --> 00:09:22,104
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

102
00:09:23,481 --> 00:09:25,816
Before you make my headache even worse,

103
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,487
no, you cannot pay me
with the money you stole.

104
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,114
Okay, that cash is Exhibit A
for the prosecution.

105
00:09:32,198 --> 00:09:36,077
So, relatives?
Anybody you haven't already fleeced?

106
00:09:37,328 --> 00:09:38,579
My grandma, maybe?

107
00:09:38,663 --> 00:09:40,414
Yeah, she got a house.

108
00:09:40,498 --> 00:09:43,125
- Yeah.
- And a car and shizz.

109
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:44,460
Yeah, grandma. She's perfect.

110
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:47,672
Okay, so you tell granny,
faster she gets me my money,

111
00:09:47,755 --> 00:09:49,131
faster I work my magic.

112
00:09:49,215 --> 00:09:51,717
My wire info is on the back of that card.

113
00:09:51,801 --> 00:09:53,386
I look forward to hearing from her.

114
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:56,347
Coming out!

115
00:10:16,993 --> 00:10:19,662
I'm sorry I'm late.
It's just one of those days.

116
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:21,247
No problem. Let me introduce you.

117
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,040
Judge Lawler, this is Jimmy McGill.

118
00:10:23,124 --> 00:10:25,626
Actually, it's Saul Goodman.
I changed my name.

119
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:29,839
But Lawler? Now, you're federal, right?
District of New Mexico?

120
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:31,090
That's me.

121
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:34,468
Thought so.
Your gavel work is legendary.

122
00:10:34,552 --> 00:10:36,929
Thank you?

123
00:10:37,013 --> 00:10:39,933
I'll let you get back to your lunch.
Catch you on the back nine next week.

124
00:10:39,974 --> 00:10:41,017
See you.

125
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,184
Jimmy?

126
00:10:42,268 --> 00:10:45,104
- And I'll have the sole and...
- No butter, side of steamed veggies?

127
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:47,023
You got me. Creature of habit.

128
00:10:47,106 --> 00:10:49,817
Great. I'll put this in,
I'll be right back with your drink.

129
00:10:57,533 --> 00:10:58,533
So...

130
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:02,496
Saul Goodman.
Am I allowed to call you Jimmy?

131
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:07,418
Saul Goodman is my professional name,
but my friends still call me Jimmy.

132
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:08,836
You can too.

133
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:11,422
Well, tell me about Saul Goodman.

134
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:13,090
What do you mean?

135
00:11:13,174 --> 00:11:17,887
Well, what I mean is,
if he's not Jimmy McGill, who is he?

136
00:11:18,888 --> 00:11:19,888
What's he about?

137
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:22,725
Well...

138
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,645
Saul Goodman is...

139
00:11:26,729 --> 00:11:30,816
He's the last line of defence
for the little guy.

140
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,902
Are you getting sold down the river?

141
00:11:32,985 --> 00:11:34,487
He's a life raft.

142
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,990
You getting stepped on,
he's a sharp stick.

143
00:11:38,074 --> 00:11:41,952
You got Goliath on your back,
Saul's the guy with the slingshot.

144
00:11:42,036 --> 00:11:46,624
He's a righter of wrongs.
He's friend to the friendless.

145
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:47,917
That's Saul Goodman.

146
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:56,092
Couldn't Jimmy McGill do all that?

147
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:02,807
Maybe he could, but Saul Goodman is.

148
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:05,059
I get it.

149
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:06,310
You do?

150
00:12:06,394 --> 00:12:09,939
Yeah. I understand
why you changed your name.

151
00:12:10,648 --> 00:12:12,149
Is that right?

152
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:15,861
Hamlin Hamlin McGill did you wrong.

153
00:12:15,945 --> 00:12:17,321
Your name is a part of that firm.

154
00:12:17,405 --> 00:12:20,950
Now it's tainted.
We took your legacy away from you.

155
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:22,076
If you say so, Howard.

156
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:24,203
No, no,
I've been thinking about this a lot.

157
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:27,164
And you know what?
We should have hired you.

158
00:12:27,248 --> 00:12:30,751
I mean, don't worry about it.
That's ancient history.

159
00:12:30,835 --> 00:12:32,878
You deserved a shot.

160
00:12:32,962 --> 00:12:34,422
And I could've given it to you

161
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:36,966
when you got barred
or when you brought us Sandpiper.

162
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:39,301
Both times,
I should've shown some backbone.

163
00:12:39,385 --> 00:12:41,303
It would've been the right thing to do.

164
00:12:41,387 --> 00:12:46,392
I am glad you had
this cleansing moment of clarity, Howard.

165
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:48,060
Good for you.

166
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,982
Let me be clear.

167
00:12:53,065 --> 00:12:55,067
I'm not interested in yesterday.

168
00:12:55,151 --> 00:12:59,488
I missed an opportunity with you,
and I think it's time to correct that.

169
00:13:01,157 --> 00:13:03,659
I'd like you to come work at HHM.

170
00:13:13,544 --> 00:13:14,712
You want me to work for you

171
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:17,131
after all the shit
that's happened between us?

172
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:19,967
Oh, as far as I'm concerned,
that's between you and Chuck.

173
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,141
Hey, look, before you offer me a job,

174
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:30,936
you might want to call your buddy,
Cliff Main.

175
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,564
He'd have a unique perspective
on employing me.

176
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:35,983
This isn't a spur-of-the-moment decision,
Jimmy.

177
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:38,903
I have been considering this for a while.

178
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:43,949
At the scholarship committee,
you spoke about that young woman.

179
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:46,327
Kristy Esposito.

180
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,828
Yes. Kristy.

181
00:13:47,912 --> 00:13:50,164
- Yeah.
- You stood up for her.

182
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:52,082
And that got me thinking.

183
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,084
About judgement

184
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:56,128
and honesty.

185
00:13:57,046 --> 00:14:01,675
And when you kicked my ass last year,
you weren't wrong.

186
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:04,428
You say what you mean.

187
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:08,265
Listen, you don't wanna be surrounded
by liars, Howard,

188
00:14:08,349 --> 00:14:09,934
you might be in the wrong profession.

189
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:12,269
Look, it's simple for me.

190
00:14:12,353 --> 00:14:16,690
You're smart. You're scrappy.
You're a go-getter.

191
00:14:16,774 --> 00:14:19,568
You don't wait for things to happen.
You make them happen.

192
00:14:19,652 --> 00:14:23,614
HHM is growing again
and could use someone like you.

193
00:14:25,074 --> 00:14:26,909
I could use you.

194
00:14:28,327 --> 00:14:29,745
Charlie Hustle.

195
00:14:31,789 --> 00:14:33,999
- Howard, I...
- You don't have to answer right now.

196
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,335
Let's just enjoy lunch.

197
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:37,920
But do me a favour.

198
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:42,132
Live with it for a bit. Okay?

199
00:14:56,272 --> 00:14:58,816
That's me.

200
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:02,111
Well, Howard, this was...

201
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:05,948
Thanks for lunch.

202
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:07,658
I'll get the next one.

203
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:09,577
Thanks for taking the time.

204
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,745
Good to see you, Jimmy.

205
00:15:41,442 --> 00:15:42,901
If you glance at the package,

206
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:45,195
it'll give you a clear idea
of what we're talking about.

207
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:49,783
There's a raft of TCPA compliance issues,
but they're fairly straightforward.

208
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:54,705
We've been in touch with the FTC,
the FCC, OSHA, same.

209
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:57,916
By the time construction's complete,
we'll be able to hire able bodies,

210
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,585
and we'll be ready to go.

211
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:02,212
Exciting to expand
beyond the old brick and mortar.

212
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:04,923
We've hit all the key benchmarks
for the Tucumcari call centre.

213
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:07,968
- And we remain well under budget.
- You know I like to hear that.

214
00:16:08,052 --> 00:16:09,928
All right. If you turn to the next tab,

215
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:11,612
there are some mortgage opportunities...

216
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:14,683
Sorry. Paige, there's one more piece
of call centre business

217
00:16:14,767 --> 00:16:16,060
I feel we need to discuss.

218
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:19,521
- Okay.
- Stef?

219
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:27,029
We decided to put this centre here,
on this parcel of land, Lot 1102.

220
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:32,826
But I think we need to reconsider
the other contender, Lot 2375.

221
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:37,039
Twenty-three seventy-five.
The vacant lot with the flooding problem?

222
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:38,374
Yes, that's right.

223
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:40,834
Initially, we did have concerns
about the infrastructure,

224
00:16:40,918 --> 00:16:43,587
but I spoke with Alex Amadeo
on the council this morning,

225
00:16:43,671 --> 00:16:46,465
and she told me the city
has recently shored up

226
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:49,218
all of the drainage along the arroyo.

227
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:53,138
And they have repaved 10 miles of roads
in the vicinity.

228
00:16:53,222 --> 00:16:55,891
So that would not only speed up
our construction,

229
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:59,478
but make for a more efficient operation
overall.

230
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:04,400
And over the long term, it seems to me
that these improvements will pay dividends

231
00:17:04,483 --> 00:17:06,402
and more than offset any delays.

232
00:17:06,485 --> 00:17:08,696
Since we won't need a redesign,

233
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:11,990
we could be back on track
in a matter of two to three weeks,

234
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:13,784
maybe less.

235
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:16,203
Are you saying that we lose three weeks

236
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:19,540
and, what, eat the cost of the land
that we already own?

237
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:24,294
I know this isn't really my department,
but according to our own projections,

238
00:17:24,378 --> 00:17:29,216
the land we already own will more than
double in value in the next five years.

239
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:32,302
This could be an excellent investment.

240
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:37,516
There's potential here to turn Tucumcari
into a real Mesa Verde company town.

241
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:42,771
And when you add in the reputational risk
with Lot 1102...

242
00:17:42,855 --> 00:17:46,442
Reputational risk?
You're talking about Everett Acker?

243
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:51,697
Ousting a man from his house,
it's never a good look.

244
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,782
Kim, let me ask this real plainly.

245
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:56,827
Is Lot 1102 our land or not?

246
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,829
Are we in the right?

247
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,166
As far as the law goes, yes.

248
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:05,169
Well, all right then.
Well, that settles it.

249
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:06,920
I'm not gonna let anybody chase me off.

250
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:09,840
This fella wants to make a fuss, well...

251
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:12,468
It's our land and our right
to do with it what we want.

252
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:13,969
I agree.

253
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:16,054
We've already offered him a sum
for relocation

254
00:18:16,138 --> 00:18:18,474
far greater than what we've paid
any of his neighbours.

255
00:18:18,557 --> 00:18:21,810
Kim, thank you for the thought,

256
00:18:21,894 --> 00:18:24,563
but I say we move forward with Lot 1102.

257
00:18:25,773 --> 00:18:27,441
How about we get the lights?

258
00:18:28,734 --> 00:18:30,861
Yeah, all right then. That's that.

259
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:33,238
I just had to mention it.

260
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:37,951
I've got a call in to the sheriff.

261
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:42,039
Come Friday at noon, Acker will be out
and construction will proceed.

262
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:44,958
Now, as I was saying, mortgages.

263
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:47,252
Our institutional clients are strong,

264
00:18:47,336 --> 00:18:49,671
but if we want to penetrate
the retail market,

265
00:18:49,755 --> 00:18:53,383
there are some opportunities that we
should explore as we develop the business.

266
00:19:17,533 --> 00:19:20,202
Pop, what are you doing here?

267
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:21,912
It's Thursday. It's my day.

268
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:25,415
You didn't get my message?
I called you to see if you were coming.

269
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:29,002
You never called me back,
so I had Emily come.

270
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:32,339
It's okay. Send her home.
I'll pay her for the night.

271
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:37,469
Well, maybe it's better
if you just sit this one out.

272
00:19:37,553 --> 00:19:40,305
I mean, they're already off,
playing dolls.

273
00:19:40,389 --> 00:19:44,226
I scared her.
I lost my temper. That's it.

274
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:46,467
If you just let me talk to her.

275
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,647
- Tell her I'm sorry...
- No, no, no. Kaylee's fine.

276
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,108
She forgot all about that.

277
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:55,112
Then what's the problem?

278
00:19:56,947 --> 00:19:59,116
I love you, Pop,

279
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:02,911
but tonight,
I think you should let Emily babysit.

280
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:08,709
Honey, I'm okay. I wouldn't tell you
I was okay if I wasn't.

281
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,670
And if Kaylee brings up Matty?

282
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,010
I'll be okay.

283
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:21,138
You're getting worked up
over nothing. I'm fine.

284
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:25,434
Look, what if maybe you come for dinner
sometime next week?

285
00:20:25,517 --> 00:20:28,103
We can have those pork chops you like.

286
00:20:28,186 --> 00:20:31,481
You've been working so hard.
You deserve a little break.

287
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:33,942
Let you get back to yourself.

288
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:37,529
Get back to myself?

289
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:43,493
Something's going on with you.

290
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:45,078
I don't know what.

291
00:20:45,162 --> 00:20:48,832
But I'd be more comfortable
if you didn't sit for Kaylee.

292
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,335
For tonight.

293
00:21:23,742 --> 00:21:26,387
We were hopping
because of that Kiss show at the pavilion.

294
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:28,664
I had those leather guys in makeup
coming in

295
00:21:28,747 --> 00:21:31,041
and buying Slim Jims and beers
all night long.

296
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:32,542
Thank you. Mr. Harkness.

297
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:35,921
Is the person who robbed you present
in the court today?

298
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:37,464
Yes.

299
00:21:37,547 --> 00:21:40,801
And could you point him out
to the court, please?

300
00:21:40,884 --> 00:21:41,802
There.

301
00:21:41,803 --> 00:21:46,057
Let the record show that the witness
has identified the defendant, Mr. Sakey.

302
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:47,599
Thank you, Mr. Harkness.

303
00:21:47,683 --> 00:21:49,309
Your witness, Mr. Goodman.

304
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:53,146
Thank you for coming in today,
Mr. Harkness.

305
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:57,109
I just want to clarify a few things
from your testimony, if that's okay.

306
00:21:57,192 --> 00:21:58,110
Okay.

307
00:21:58,111 --> 00:22:02,115
So you were working at the Sandia Mart
the night of the 30th. Is that correct?

308
00:22:02,197 --> 00:22:03,877
Got in at noon, left at midnight.

309
00:22:03,949 --> 00:22:06,576
That's a long day. Good for you.

310
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,412
Nothing wrong with a hard day's work.

311
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:12,040
So you say a man came in,
and he reached across the counter

312
00:22:12,124 --> 00:22:14,876
and, quote...

313
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,672
He grabbed up the money
from my register and run off.

314
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:20,507
Yeah.

315
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,592
And there was no one else in the store?

316
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:25,012
Not at that time, no.

317
00:22:25,095 --> 00:22:28,306
And since the camera system wasn't working
at the time,

318
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:31,893
you're the only one
who saw the perpetrator.

319
00:22:31,977 --> 00:22:33,353
Yeah. I guess so.

320
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:38,525
Yeah.

321
00:22:38,526 --> 00:22:41,528
So this person came in,
and they bought something.

322
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:44,197
- I think it was an Almond Joy.
- And they bought an Almond Joy.

323
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:45,866
And when you rang them up,

324
00:22:45,949 --> 00:22:48,910
that's when they snatched the cash
from the register.

325
00:22:48,994 --> 00:22:50,434
Sounds like it happened pretty fast,

326
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:53,582
but you say you got a good look at them,
correct?

327
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:54,791
Yes.

328
00:22:55,876 --> 00:22:59,963
You must drink stronger coffee than I do,
because after 11 hours on the job,

329
00:23:00,047 --> 00:23:02,924
I can barely see straight.
And it was dark out.

330
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:05,927
He was the only guy that came in
that night that wasn't made up

331
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:09,347
like a bat or a cat or whatever the hell
those guys are.

332
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:11,808
And he was right up in my face.

333
00:23:11,892 --> 00:23:12,808
Right in your face?

334
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:16,189
And according to your testimony,
you feel confident

335
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:17,814
that you can identify this person.

336
00:23:17,898 --> 00:23:21,151
- That's what you're saying.
- I can, absolutely.

337
00:23:22,152 --> 00:23:25,030
It's him. Your client.

338
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:27,550
Are you sure that's the person?
There's no doubt in your mind?

339
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:28,950
Take your time.

340
00:23:29,034 --> 00:23:31,328
I don't need time. That's him.

341
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:33,872
Now, would you be surprised to learn,
Mr. Harkness,

342
00:23:33,955 --> 00:23:36,833
that the person you just pointed to
is not the defendant?

343
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:40,462
- What?
- My client

344
00:23:40,545 --> 00:23:43,265
is in the back of the courtroom.
Mr. Sakey, would you please stand up?

345
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,340
Objection.

346
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:47,135
The person you ID'd
is named Hollis Earley.

347
00:23:47,219 --> 00:23:48,804
He's a bartender down in Belen.

348
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:51,098
He has a very good alibi
for the night in question.

349
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:55,727
- Your Honour, objection!
- Oh, Mr. Goodman! Really?

350
00:23:55,811 --> 00:23:57,854
You didn't recognise him either,
Your Honour.

351
00:23:57,938 --> 00:24:00,273
All right, settle down, everybody.
Settle. Settle.

352
00:24:04,528 --> 00:24:07,322
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
we're gonna call it a day.

353
00:24:08,323 --> 00:24:12,410
I will have very specific instructions
for you tomorrow.

354
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:15,497
As always, please refrain
from discussing the case until then,

355
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:19,793
and I will see counsel in my chambers now.

356
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:20,876
Adjourned.

357
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:48,321
- You're still here.
- Yeah.

358
00:24:49,531 --> 00:24:52,033
You saw the fireworks.

359
00:24:52,117 --> 00:24:55,078
It was a bit unorthodox.

360
00:24:55,162 --> 00:24:57,581
But check this out.

361
00:24:57,664 --> 00:25:01,585
Two sweetest words
in the English language, miss, trial.

362
00:25:03,211 --> 00:25:06,173
- Not bad, huh?
- Not bad.

363
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:10,969
Is everything okay?

364
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:14,556
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's just...

365
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:20,770
I have a case in Tucumcari.

366
00:25:20,854 --> 00:25:22,898
And there's something
I wanna discuss with you.

367
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:44,461
Fry pit looks good, Deshawn.
You can take off.

368
00:25:44,544 --> 00:25:46,504
Night, Tiffany. Good work.

369
00:25:47,631 --> 00:25:50,634
Good work. Juana, very good work.

370
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:54,512
Crap, I forgot to cover the fryer.

371
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:57,349
Don't worry. I'll get it.

372
00:25:57,432 --> 00:25:59,517
- Thanks, man.
- Sure.

373
00:26:00,644 --> 00:26:02,562
See you tomorrow, Deshawn.

374
00:26:19,287 --> 00:26:20,914
Everything all right, Mr. Fring?

375
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:23,583
This is acceptable to you?

376
00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:30,423
I thought Deshawn did a good job.

377
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:36,721
I'm not seeing anything. It's...

378
00:26:38,056 --> 00:26:39,599
I understand.

379
00:26:41,726 --> 00:26:47,065
You know, like,
now that I look closer...

380
00:26:48,066 --> 00:26:50,527
Yeah, I think I see maybe...

381
00:26:51,528 --> 00:26:56,449
Yeah. Okay.
I'll take care of it, Mr. Fring.

382
00:26:57,575 --> 00:27:00,787
- All right.
- Yeah. I'm sorry about that. Sorry.

383
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:30,358
Who puts a dead drop in a culvert?

384
00:27:31,443 --> 00:27:35,238
I mean, rain comes and
your money's on its way to the Rio Grande.

385
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:38,742
So you use a different drop
during the monsoon season.

386
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:43,705
Culvert. That's a weird word.

387
00:27:44,831 --> 00:27:48,043
- What do you think that is, like, Dutch?
- Maybe French.

388
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:53,298
- It's not French.
- In Spanish, it's alcantarilla.

389
00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:56,468
Well, it... it doesn't come from Spanish.

390
00:27:57,469 --> 00:27:59,429
I mean,
you ever hear anyone walk around

391
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:01,639
talking about the majestic culverts
of Spain?

392
00:28:01,723 --> 00:28:05,477
Who the hell goes around
talking about majestic culverts?

393
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:09,064
Target is approaching.
Position 2, stand by.

394
00:28:09,147 --> 00:28:11,775
Copy. Standing by.

395
00:28:15,445 --> 00:28:19,699
Well, only one drop left. That's us.

396
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:21,818
You think he'll do all three?

397
00:28:21,868 --> 00:28:25,080
Well, Molina's info has checked out
so far.

398
00:28:26,373 --> 00:28:28,083
Long as we don't spook the target,

399
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:32,045
I say he rounds third
and goes straight for home.

400
00:28:36,674 --> 00:28:38,093
You know how to use that thing?

401
00:28:39,094 --> 00:28:41,721
Point it at the bad guy.
Press the button.

402
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:47,018
Don't miss your shot, Ansel Adams.
We need this guy.

403
00:28:47,102 --> 00:28:50,897
Position 2, we have the target.
Looks like he's headed inside.

404
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:53,316
Copy.

405
00:28:57,987 --> 00:28:59,489
Culvert.

406
00:29:00,615 --> 00:29:03,451
Culvert.

407
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:09,082
Sounds like a Dutch word for crotch rot.

408
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:13,586
Target is on the move,
headed toward Position 3.

409
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:17,715
All right, guys, keep your distance.

410
00:29:19,175 --> 00:29:22,137
Hey, Byers and Vacca, roll back 30 yards.

411
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,556
If I can see you, he can too.

412
00:29:25,682 --> 00:29:27,892
We don't want him to get nervous.

413
00:29:27,976 --> 00:29:31,187
Wanna keep him nice and relaxed.

414
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:34,232
Like your mom on date night.

415
00:29:34,315 --> 00:29:36,568
Like your left hand every night.

416
00:29:45,743 --> 00:29:47,579
Is it okay, Mr. Fring?

417
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,582
You can go home, Lyle.

418
00:29:52,917 --> 00:29:55,420
If it's not right, just let me try again.

419
00:29:55,503 --> 00:29:58,298
I can get this right for you, sir.
Please.

420
00:30:02,969 --> 00:30:06,598
If you would like to take
another crack at it, then go ahead.

421
00:30:07,932 --> 00:30:09,392
Thank you.

422
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:35,418
Here's our guy.

423
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:40,131
- Cap off the lens there, Gomey.
- Screw you.

424
00:31:26,678 --> 00:31:28,846
Shit. He make us?

425
00:31:35,186 --> 00:31:37,188
Nah, I think we're good.

426
00:32:10,805 --> 00:32:12,765
Goddamn it.

427
00:32:12,849 --> 00:32:18,396
Hey, yeah, our target's in flight.
All units, go west on Bobby Foster.

428
00:32:18,479 --> 00:32:19,606
We're in pursuit.

429
00:32:29,324 --> 00:32:31,284
- What are you doing?
- Getting ahead of him.

430
00:32:31,367 --> 00:32:34,329
- To where the puck's gonna be.
- But you don't know where he's going!

431
00:32:34,412 --> 00:32:35,580
I got a feeling.

432
00:33:23,378 --> 00:33:26,798
Federal agents! Come on out!

433
00:33:31,594 --> 00:33:33,471
Nice and slow!

434
00:33:34,597 --> 00:33:38,017
Hands! Show me your hands!

435
00:33:41,104 --> 00:33:42,563
Damn it.

436
00:34:19,058 --> 00:34:20,476
Schrader!

437
00:34:41,789 --> 00:34:45,960
Well, what do you say, Gomey?
Let's spelunk.

438
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:19,577
All right. I lost them.

439
00:35:27,627 --> 00:35:31,005
Six ninety-six, 698,

440
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:35,885
700,000 dollars and some change.

441
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:37,678
Damn.

442
00:35:37,762 --> 00:35:40,765
We sure took a bite out of crime tonight,
McGruff.

443
00:35:40,848 --> 00:35:43,017
Booby prize.

444
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:47,271
Come on, man. We got the money.
We got the douchebags who did the drop.

445
00:35:47,355 --> 00:35:49,524
We got three assholes in cuffs.

446
00:35:49,607 --> 00:35:53,903
And we put Molina back out on the street.
Who knows what else he's gonna scare up?

447
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:58,699
Yeah, I wanted to go upstream, Gomey,
not downstream.

448
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:08,251
Here goes.

449
00:36:08,334 --> 00:36:11,879
Alrighty.
Everybody, circle up! Circle up!

450
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:15,007
Come on, bring it in!

451
00:36:16,384 --> 00:36:19,971
I just wanna thank you all
for a successful operation.

452
00:36:20,054 --> 00:36:24,475
Great work across the board.
APD, hey, you guys are first-rate.

453
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:28,354
We're putting bracelets
on three shitbirds as we speak.

454
00:36:28,437 --> 00:36:31,899
And better yet, we got ourselves
a buttload of money.

455
00:36:31,983 --> 00:36:34,068
All right?
Just shy of a million dollars.

456
00:36:34,151 --> 00:36:37,530
So some major dickwad
of a dealer's hurting tonight.

457
00:36:37,613 --> 00:36:39,699
And that's because of all of you.

458
00:36:39,782 --> 00:36:43,035
So to show my appreciation,

459
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:46,080
we're all going to O'Neill's,
and first round's on me.

460
00:36:46,163 --> 00:36:48,416
- Yeah!
- Yeah! All right!

461
00:36:48,499 --> 00:36:49,499
Thank y'all!

462
00:36:59,385 --> 00:37:01,971
- All clear.
- And the money?

463
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:04,849
They got it.
Went down like it was supposed to.

464
00:37:18,988 --> 00:37:22,491
Mr. Fring,
I was just about to come find you.

465
00:37:22,575 --> 00:37:25,244
Thank you, Lyle. You can go home.

466
00:37:28,706 --> 00:37:30,458
But is it, like...?

467
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:35,421
- You think it's okay? It's clean?
- It is acceptable.

468
00:37:44,847 --> 00:37:46,891
Have a good night, Mr. Fring.

469
00:38:35,898 --> 00:38:36,898
Who the hell are you?

470
00:38:36,899 --> 00:38:39,735
Mr. Acker, my name is Saul Goodman.
I'm an attorney.

471
00:38:39,819 --> 00:38:43,864
I've had it up to here
with you Mesa Verde scumbags. Get bent.

472
00:38:43,948 --> 00:38:47,284
I'm not representing Mesa Verde.
In fact, I'd like to represent you, sir.

473
00:38:47,368 --> 00:38:49,745
I don't need a lawyer.
I don't want a lawyer.

474
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:52,039
Nothing you can say
is gonna change my mind.

475
00:38:52,123 --> 00:38:55,042
- Now, move your damn foot.
- Sir, if you would just...

476
00:38:55,126 --> 00:38:57,294
Please, just take a look at my proposal,
okay?

477
00:38:57,378 --> 00:38:59,338
Because I think you'll find it persuasive.

478
00:38:59,422 --> 00:39:01,382
- I don't want it.
- Just look at it, sir.

479
00:39:01,465 --> 00:39:03,592
Just look. What do you see?

480
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:11,017
A man...

481
00:39:15,646 --> 00:39:17,898
fucking a horse.

482
00:39:18,899 --> 00:39:24,655
Sir, I hate Mesa Verde. I hate them.
Looking down at us from their glass tower.

483
00:39:24,739 --> 00:39:26,824
They think they can shit
on whoever they want,

484
00:39:26,907 --> 00:39:29,285
and we have to smile and say,
thank you?

485
00:39:29,368 --> 00:39:33,581
Look, picture me as the man
and Mesa Verde as the horse.

486
00:39:33,664 --> 00:39:37,168
I'm the guy who'll do whatever it takes
to stick it to them.

487
00:39:40,588 --> 00:39:43,090
Guess who's got a new client
in Tucumcari.

488
00:39:43,174 --> 00:39:45,468
- What?
- That's right. Put some beers on ice.

489
00:39:45,551 --> 00:39:48,095
We'll celebrate when I get back
from the hinterlands.

490
00:39:48,179 --> 00:39:50,681
Yes.
That's the best news I've heard all day.

491
00:39:50,765 --> 00:39:53,142
How the hell did you convince him?

492
00:39:54,477 --> 00:39:55,853
Visual aids.

493
00:39:55,936 --> 00:40:00,149
You'd be surprised what you can find
on that internet. So Chinese tonight?

494
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:02,318
- Yeah, sounds good. I'll see you later.
- Bye.

495
00:42:56,075 --> 00:42:59,286
- What'd y'all get into last night?
- Absolutely nothing, G.

496
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:01,765
- Yo, G, pass that lighter.
- Hey, yo, your girl came by.

497
00:43:01,789 --> 00:43:03,189
You need to keep her in check, fam.

498
00:43:03,249 --> 00:43:04,207
She tripping.

499
00:43:04,208 --> 00:43:05,810
I've been telling you about that, man.

500
00:43:05,834 --> 00:43:07,646
- Black her eyes.
- Yo, yo. Ain't that...?

501
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:09,213
Yo, that's...

502
00:43:32,611 --> 00:43:33,946
Yo, Gramps!

503
00:43:47,001 --> 00:43:48,669
First one's free, dickhead!
