1
00:00:02,253 --> 00:00:04,714
How about a special discount?

2
00:00:04,881 --> 00:00:08,301
For the next two weeks,

3
00:00:08,385 --> 00:00:13,431
non-violent felonies,
50 percent off. Yeah.

4
00:00:14,516 --> 00:00:16,184
- Okay.
- I'll take one.

5
00:00:16,267 --> 00:00:20,313
Yeah. That's for you. Fifty percent off.
Yeah, all right. Now we got some takers.

6
00:00:20,397 --> 00:00:25,193
There you are. Oh, yeah. Who else?
Fifty percent off. There you are.

7
00:00:25,276 --> 00:00:29,072
- Fifty percent off.
- Dude, that's almost half.

8
00:00:48,258 --> 00:00:50,301
Hey! You bastards!

9
00:00:50,385 --> 00:00:52,011
Fifty percent off!

10
00:00:57,392 --> 00:00:58,601
Money, money, money!

11
00:00:58,685 --> 00:01:00,186
Money, money, money.

12
00:01:07,652 --> 00:01:08,903
Yeah!

13
00:01:34,596 --> 00:01:37,766
Yeah! I got my money! Yeah!

14
00:01:39,726 --> 00:01:40,726
Yeah.

15
00:01:51,988 --> 00:01:54,240
Get back here, you little bitch!

16
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,202
I'm okay!

17
00:01:58,745 --> 00:02:00,371
Fifty percent off!

18
00:02:21,142 --> 00:02:23,019
Yeah!

19
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,086
- Yo.
- What?

20
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:49,754
- Dude.
- What?

21
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,841
What day is it?

22
00:02:55,218 --> 00:02:56,427
Tuesday?

23
00:02:59,806 --> 00:03:00,890
Tuesday?

24
00:03:02,976 --> 00:03:04,769
- What?
- You know what that means?

25
00:03:06,396 --> 00:03:08,648
Fifty percent off!

00:03:43,558 --> 00:03:46,102

Baby, what's happening?

33
00:04:24,474 --> 00:04:26,059
What's happening, baby?

34
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:28,770
Get off of me, man.

35
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:35,985
It's okay.

36
00:04:39,948 --> 00:04:43,117
Come on, man.
What do you want from me?

37
00:04:43,201 --> 00:04:46,496
I switched the stuff.
I played it all like he told me.

38
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,391
No.

39
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:08,558
No.

40
00:05:11,521 --> 00:05:13,106
What are we doing?

41
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:17,318
Come on, man. Don't.

42
00:05:17,402 --> 00:05:18,695
You got five people in there.

43
00:05:18,778 --> 00:05:19,736
Too bad.

44
00:05:19,737 --> 00:05:22,157
Hey, wait! Wait. Wait.

45
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,160
Hey! Hey, wait! Wait. Hey, wait!

46
00:05:26,244 --> 00:05:27,412
Why is he doing this?

47
00:05:27,495 --> 00:05:29,580
Hey, why is he doing this?
I did everything.

48
00:05:29,664 --> 00:05:30,665
Wait.

49
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:35,920
Please, man.
Please, man, please, no. Please, no.

50
00:05:36,004 --> 00:05:38,589
Please. Man, please.

51
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:41,300
Please, man.

52
00:06:07,744 --> 00:06:09,245
Okay.

53
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:10,538
I get it.

54
00:06:12,123 --> 00:06:15,543
Just tell me what you want me to do.

55
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:20,465
Lalo Salamanca.

56
00:06:21,674 --> 00:06:24,510
I need to know where he is going.

57
00:06:24,594 --> 00:06:26,846
What he is thinking.

58
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:29,265
What he's planning.

59
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:33,102
I need to know what he's going to do
before he does it.

60
00:06:33,186 --> 00:06:36,773
I've been trying, okay?

61
00:06:36,856 --> 00:06:38,816
He doesn't tell me shit.

62
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:43,321
He's just keeps talking about some guy
named Werner Ziegler.

63
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:46,365
And some gringo Michael.
That's it.

64
00:06:50,286 --> 00:06:55,124
Gain his confidence.
Make him rely on you.

65
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:56,209
How?

66
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:01,089
Find a way.

67
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,850
My father has nothing to do with this.

68
00:07:21,734 --> 00:07:24,695
I'll find a way. I'll make him trust me.

69
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:28,199
Okay?

70
00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:06,571
Your pop's a nice guy.

71
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:23,171
Yeah. Sure.
Let me see if I have this right.

72
00:08:24,172 --> 00:08:27,175
A Mr. Bertram Moran, aka B-Mo,

73
00:08:27,258 --> 00:08:30,595
claims that you solicited him
for the purchase of narcotics

74
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:35,224
when, in fact, you were simply enjoying
a Big Gulp in the park

75
00:08:35,308 --> 00:08:38,019
when he approached
and attempted to sell to you.

76
00:08:38,102 --> 00:08:40,605
I got a live one.

77
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:42,398
Yes, PJ. Go ahead.

78
00:08:46,611 --> 00:08:49,197
Kim, sorry. My side is too full.

79
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,491
I'm gonna take some of those
back to Mrs. Nguyen's.

80
00:08:53,826 --> 00:08:55,077
Yeah, uh-huh.

81
00:08:56,162 --> 00:08:58,164
Well, I think I got the specifics.

82
00:08:58,247 --> 00:08:59,624
I'll call you later.

83
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:01,417
Geez. A chatty one.

84
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:07,590
So, hey, how's it going with Cold Finger,
the mini-fridge mastermind?

85
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:09,967
Did you get a trial date yet?

86
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:12,553
No. He took the deal.

87
00:09:13,721 --> 00:09:15,932
He took the five months?

88
00:09:16,015 --> 00:09:17,475
Yup.

89
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:18,559
You were right, as usual.

90
00:09:19,936 --> 00:09:23,314
Saul Goodman, speedy justice for you.

91
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:26,692
Yes, miss. I...

92
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:31,405
Oh, no. Well, that's not right.

93
00:09:31,489 --> 00:09:32,907
Yeah. Go on.

94
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:38,287
Can you hold for a moment?
Kim, how about dinner and a movie tonight?

95
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:44,126
I'm... Scampi and Scorsese because they got
After Hours on the Classic Movie Channel.

96
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:46,921
I love that one,
but we'll have to see.

97
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:48,881
I might need to stay late.

98
00:09:48,965 --> 00:09:51,050
Okay. Just let me know.

99
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:52,760
Yeah. I'll see you.

100
00:09:57,682 --> 00:10:00,685
Yes, go ahead.
There's something about a minivan?

101
00:10:19,203 --> 00:10:20,705
- Kim.
- Jimmy, what are you...?

102
00:10:20,788 --> 00:10:24,375
There's something I gotta show you.
It's just three blocks from here.

103
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,294
Look, I... Sorry.

104
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:31,590
I know you gotta get to work. This will
only take a couple of minutes, please.

105
00:10:31,674 --> 00:10:35,469
Drive. If we go right now,
it will be over like that.

106
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:41,058
- Which way?
- Take a right.

107
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:51,360
There. Right there.

108
00:10:51,444 --> 00:10:54,196
- The white one?
- Yeah. That one. Right there.

109
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:06,751
Jimmy, we're not buying a house.

110
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:10,338
Maybe not today,
but doesn't hurt to look, does it?

111
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:14,383
I drove by this place like a week ago,
and I'm curious.

112
00:11:14,467 --> 00:11:16,510
Aren't you, just a little?

113
00:11:17,553 --> 00:11:19,180
Look at all that space.

114
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:25,978
Hey, you're doing great. I'm gonna
be doing great. I got 45 clients.

115
00:11:26,062 --> 00:11:28,773
Forty-five?
How are you gonna handle all that?

116
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:31,275
I got a system, but can we just look?

117
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:35,196
They're not even open yet.

118
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,783
Yeah, well. They want to sell this house.
They'll let us in.

119
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,620
All right.

120
00:12:00,513 --> 00:12:02,973
Hey, folks. Do you mind signing in?

121
00:12:03,057 --> 00:12:05,309
There's a guestbook right over here.

122
00:12:05,393 --> 00:12:08,729
You know what?
Could we do that on our way out?

123
00:12:08,813 --> 00:12:09,729
Sure.

124
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:13,026
Just take your time. Have a look around.
Let me know if you have any questions.

125
00:12:13,109 --> 00:12:14,652
- You got it.
- Thanks.

126
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:19,740
Man, look at all this wall space.

127
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:25,746
Imagine a plasma TV mounted right there.

128
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:28,332
One of the huge new ones.

129
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:34,046
Hey, this would be a big change,
but we could make it our own.

130
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,632
We could host movie nights.

131
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:40,761
Some comfy chairs
and smell of popcorn in the air, and...

132
00:12:40,845 --> 00:12:43,139
And check out these countertops.

133
00:12:43,222 --> 00:12:44,348
Yeah.

134
00:12:45,558 --> 00:12:48,185
Blue. Is this quartz?

135
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:50,813
I read somewhere
that it's good for healing.

136
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:53,023
So good for healing.

137
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,742
Hey. You know that...

138
00:13:03,826 --> 00:13:06,871
50 percent off thing I said
I wouldn't do?

139
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:08,497
Well, I did it.

140
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:13,252
I told a few potential clients.
It just kind of slipped out.

141
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:14,837
Don't worry. I know these people.

142
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,506
They're not gonna do anything
because of some stupid discount.

143
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:21,343
But it was a bonehead move
and I shouldn't have done it.

144
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:28,558
Okay.

145
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:52,875
Jimmy, I know you were trying to help,

146
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:56,879
but I don't want to lie to my clients.

147
00:13:57,505 --> 00:14:00,049
Are you talking about the fridge guy?
That was a dumb idea.

148
00:14:00,132 --> 00:14:01,800
I mean all my clients.

149
00:14:03,469 --> 00:14:07,056
Of course. Absolutely. Never again.

150
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:21,946
Oh, my God.

151
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:27,493
- This is the closet of your dreams.
- Our dreams.

152
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:30,079
Sure.

153
00:14:30,162 --> 00:14:34,416
Where are my Louboutins?
Louboutins? Louboutins?

154
00:14:36,544 --> 00:14:38,671
Hey, check this out.

155
00:14:42,258 --> 00:14:45,636
- Oh, there's jets.
- Yeah, it's like a mini spa.

156
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:48,180
That would be so nice
after a long day on our feet.

157
00:14:48,264 --> 00:14:52,810
Yeah. And two sinks.
So plenty of room for brushing.

158
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:54,728
And spitting.

159
00:14:54,812 --> 00:14:56,689
Hey, you gotta see this.

160
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,818
I mean, look at all the nozzles.

161
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:05,698
- Yeah.
- Is that what I think it is?

162
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:07,533
Steam?

163
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:10,244
But how do you get it going?

164
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,330
Maybe the water's shut off.

165
00:15:13,414 --> 00:15:14,748
Maybe.

166
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,127
Hey...

167
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,378
Quit it.

168
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:23,465
You're... Very mature. Very mature.

169
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,767
Thanks again.

170
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,778
Nice house, huh?

171
00:15:45,821 --> 00:15:48,407
Yeah. Maybe someday.

172
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:07,426
My turn.

173
00:16:12,348 --> 00:16:13,641
Hang on, Tio.

174
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:18,187
Excuse me, Mr. Salamanca.

175
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:21,940
Would you give your uncle some of this?
It's Fizzy K. He needs to hydrate.

176
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:23,317
Fizzy K?

177
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,444
It's just a vitamin solution.

178
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:28,697
It's very berry, his favourite.
Right, Hector?

179
00:16:28,781 --> 00:16:31,825
- Thanks. I'll make sure he drinks it.
- Thank you.

180
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:49,510
Look, Tio.

181
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:09,822
What's he doing?

182
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:15,411
He's building something.

183
00:17:18,706 --> 00:17:20,124
A tunnel...

184
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:24,628
A lab... maybe a vault?

185
00:17:24,712 --> 00:17:26,839
He's preparing for something big.

186
00:17:28,507 --> 00:17:31,593
He lies to me with this shit
about the Germans.

187
00:17:31,677 --> 00:17:34,847
Maybe Eladio and Bolsa
believe it but I don't.

188
00:17:36,515 --> 00:17:38,475
But what can I do?

189
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:43,939
They don't give a shit.
As long as he makes them cash.

190
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,526
What?

191
00:17:49,278 --> 00:17:50,320
You mean the money?

192
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:53,323
Right...

193
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,493
The money.

194
00:17:56,577 --> 00:17:58,704
As long as he brings in the money,
he's protected.

195
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:07,921
Gross, Tio.

196
00:18:08,964 --> 00:18:10,466
This is shit.

197
00:18:23,187 --> 00:18:26,565
Let's see. Better, no?

198
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:13,737
Yeah?

199
00:19:13,821 --> 00:19:17,157
Mike, hi. I'm sorry to bother you.

200
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:19,868
No, no bother, honey. What's up?

201
00:19:19,952 --> 00:19:23,705
I don't know what your work schedule
is like these days.

202
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:25,833
I'm still making my own hours.

203
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:28,669
Well, I just got called in.

204
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:31,213
- Emily's busy, and...
- No problem.

205
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:32,673
Are you sure?

206
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:35,300
Positive. I'll be happy to watch her.

207
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:39,555
- What time do you need me there?
- How about now?

208
00:19:41,807 --> 00:19:42,807
Now.

209
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:46,353
On the way.

210
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:49,022
Oh, thanks, Mike. You're a lifesaver.

211
00:19:49,106 --> 00:19:50,107
Yeah.

212
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,694
- Hey!
- Hey.

213
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:57,531
I thought we'd finish fixing the ladder
on the treehouse.

214
00:19:57,614 --> 00:19:59,700
- Pop-Pop!
- Hey, kid.

215
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:03,745
She needs to finish her homework first.
Don't let her sweet-talk you.

216
00:20:03,829 --> 00:20:05,372
No, not a chance of that.

217
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:09,084
She gotta learn her times tables.
She's on the sevens.

218
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:10,460
Sevens?

219
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:14,923
There's lasagne in the oven
and I should be back before bedtime.

220
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:16,842
- Sounds good.
- Okay.

221
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:19,970
- See you later, sweetie!
- Bye, Mom!

222
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:21,053
Bye.

223
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:27,686
What do we got?

224
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:29,479
Sevens are the worst.

225
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:34,401
I bet you know
more than you think you know.

226
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:36,320
I do?

227
00:20:36,987 --> 00:20:39,239
You remember when we watched
the Super Bowl?

228
00:20:41,158 --> 00:20:43,327
Seven times three?

229
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:47,414
- Twenty-one.
- Right. Seven times four?

230
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:50,667
Four touchdowns equals 28.

231
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:54,296
Plus another one makes 35.

232
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:57,174
Go, Eagles! Kick ass.

233
00:20:57,257 --> 00:21:00,052
You don't talk like that.
Who taught you to talk like that?

234
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:02,095
You did.

235
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:06,266
Come on. Seven times eight?

236
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:11,021
- That's a lot of touchdowns.
- It's a lot of touchdowns.

237
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:13,357
It's a big game. Where are we at?

238
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,360
Fifty-five?

239
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:18,820
So you think the kicker
missed the extra point?

240
00:21:18,904 --> 00:21:21,823
Oh, no. It's 56.

241
00:21:21,907 --> 00:21:24,326
Seven times eight is 56.

242
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:25,409
You got it.

243
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,040
My dad liked the Eagles, right?

244
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,752
Yeah. He sure did.

245
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:35,462
Was he good at math?

246
00:21:36,505 --> 00:21:38,757
- Thank you.
- Yeah, he...

247
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:42,177
Your daddy was a smart kid.

248
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:44,763
A good student like you.

249
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:49,267
Did he want to be a policeman
when he was my age?

250
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:51,186
When he was your age...

251
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:58,276
You know, I think he went back and forth
between an astronaut, deep sea explorer

252
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,404
like Jacques Cousteau.

253
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:01,530
Who?

254
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:04,366
You don't know Jacques Cousteau?

255
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:06,243
Well, we'll fix that.

256
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:09,246
So instead,
my dad decided to be a policeman.

257
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:10,329
Like you.

258
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,540
Yeah.

259
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:15,794
Hey, make sure those are nice and even.

260
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:21,008
And he was a really good policeman, right?

261
00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:26,429
Yes.

262
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:30,600
And you taught him.

263
00:22:31,643 --> 00:22:33,020
But...

264
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:34,813
the bad guys got him?

265
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:40,485
- I told you to make those even.
- I am.

266
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:43,864
No, you're not!
You're making a mess.

267
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:46,033
You either do it right,
or you don't do it.

268
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:47,325
But I wanna do it.

269
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:49,161
You're done. You are done!

270
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:07,386
Hey.

271
00:23:08,346 --> 00:23:11,016
- Where's Kaylee?
- She's in her room. She won't come out.

272
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:14,561
- She didn't eat dinner.
- Why? What happened?

273
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:15,644
Mike!

274
00:23:41,546 --> 00:23:44,007
<i>And they expect me to glow,
so I gotta be cold</i>

275
00:23:44,091 --> 00:23:46,301
<i>Like a baseball, shawty,
I gotta be pro</i>

276
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:47,594
Yeah.

277
00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:52,766
So? Two?

278
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:54,726
It's gonna be a 10 tonight.

279
00:23:56,228 --> 00:23:57,813
- Ten?
- Yeah.

280
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,417
<i>I don't care what they were saying,
I ain't wanting to know</i>

281
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:03,693
<i>I know hating's real bad,
for your arteries though</i>

282
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:05,987
<i>Every party, we go,
everybody we know</i>

283
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:41,523
Hey! Why you doing that?

284
00:24:41,606 --> 00:24:44,693
- Where's the cookie?
- I sent it down.

285
00:24:46,027 --> 00:24:47,107
Well, it ain't here.

286
00:24:47,154 --> 00:24:48,864
- Yeah, it is.
- What up?

287
00:24:48,947 --> 00:24:50,699
- No stuff.
- No stuff?

288
00:24:50,782 --> 00:24:51,992
It's there.

289
00:24:53,076 --> 00:24:53,994
No, it ain't!

290
00:24:53,995 --> 00:24:55,537
Quit that, fool!

291
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,205
Who you calling fool, fool?

292
00:24:57,289 --> 00:24:58,915
Don't make me come down there.

293
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,585
Stop playing!

294
00:25:01,668 --> 00:25:04,421
- Oh, you better come down here!
- Shut up!

295
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:06,339
You shut up!

296
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:08,967
- Shut up!
- You shut up!

297
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,635
Shut up!

298
00:25:21,396 --> 00:25:22,396
Call.

299
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:28,612
Fairground spot's doing really good.
Lots of traffic.

300
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:29,695
Hey.

301
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,073
Shut up while I'm in a hand.

302
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:50,967
You know what?

303
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:56,056
Two hundred.

304
00:25:56,139 --> 00:25:58,934
Oh, man.

305
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:13,865
It's too deep for me.

306
00:26:19,955 --> 00:26:21,498
And did I get you?

307
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:23,375
Let me see what you had.

308
00:26:25,377 --> 00:26:26,503
You had a set?

309
00:26:28,046 --> 00:26:30,840
You had three eights on the turn,
and you don't raise?

310
00:26:30,924 --> 00:26:32,884
And then you fold at the river?

311
00:26:32,968 --> 00:26:34,302
It's too bad.

312
00:26:34,386 --> 00:26:35,929
Ocho Loco this guy, huh?

313
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:40,308
All right, guys, give me your cards.

314
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:43,561
Sorry.

315
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,275
Yeah?

316
00:26:50,485 --> 00:26:51,485
Hold on.

317
00:26:54,531 --> 00:26:56,408
Problem on Fifth Street.

318
00:26:56,491 --> 00:26:59,494
Some skells say
they didn't get their stuff.

319
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:00,577
It's your crew.

320
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:05,458
Off you go, Ocho Loco.

321
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:08,919
Okay.

322
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:20,974
Yo.

323
00:27:21,057 --> 00:27:23,059
Maybe we could shoot the pipe.

324
00:27:23,143 --> 00:27:24,519
Like with a gun.

325
00:27:25,562 --> 00:27:27,022
Hey, we ain't shooting nothing.

326
00:27:27,105 --> 00:27:30,900
Oh, okay. Well, we paid for our shit,
so we're getting our shit.

327
00:27:30,984 --> 00:27:32,068
Yeah.

328
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:33,528
<i>Where's our glass?</i>

329
00:27:33,611 --> 00:27:36,698
<i>We're gonna kick your ass</i>

330
00:27:36,781 --> 00:27:37,907
Yo, give me the mic.

331
00:27:37,991 --> 00:27:40,535
- Mic.
- So I can rap about this pipe.

332
00:27:40,618 --> 00:27:43,413
<i>Yo, my name is Mr. Sticky,
I'm pretty fricking tricky</i>

333
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:44,776
<i>Gonna kick you in the thicky</i>

334
00:27:44,831 --> 00:27:45,957
What does that even mean?

335
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:48,168
<i>'Cause I'm Mr. Picky
and I'm so tricky</i>

336
00:27:48,251 --> 00:27:49,794
Yeah, yeah, you're thicky.

337
00:27:50,837 --> 00:27:53,506
- Oh, shit!
- Hey, we still get our glass, right?

338
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,506
Domingo!

339
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:00,597
Hey!

340
00:28:01,931 --> 00:28:04,100
This your vehicle?

341
00:28:04,184 --> 00:28:05,184
No, sir.

342
00:28:05,226 --> 00:28:06,770
Wanna come down here?

343
00:28:06,853 --> 00:28:08,063
No problem, officer.

344
00:28:13,568 --> 00:28:14,736
What you doing up there?

345
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:17,530
Just fixing a drainpipe.

346
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:19,783
Some kind of block.

347
00:28:25,747 --> 00:28:26,747
Guess you fixed it.

348
00:28:41,388 --> 00:28:44,057
- Only Domingo got picked up?
- Yeah.

349
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:47,435
The rest of us bounced,
but he was stuck up there.

350
00:28:55,693 --> 00:28:57,987
Shit, whole block's crawling.

351
00:29:01,199 --> 00:29:02,325
You got the stuff?

352
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:06,204
- You got it?
- Nah.

353
00:29:06,287 --> 00:29:07,914
I had to leave it.

354
00:29:07,997 --> 00:29:09,582
They were on my ass.

355
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:13,169
Hey! Right here.

356
00:29:16,673 --> 00:29:18,591
Shit's gone now.

357
00:29:18,675 --> 00:29:20,969
These assholes will turn
the whole place upside-down.

358
00:29:24,264 --> 00:29:25,515
How much is in there?

359
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:29,936
Almost a full load.

360
00:29:40,238 --> 00:29:41,448
Wait, where you going?

361
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:44,951
What the hell are you doing?

362
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:51,499
Stupid idiot,
they're going to catch your ass.

363
00:30:11,227 --> 00:30:13,229
Where'd he go?

364
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:16,733
There he is.

365
00:30:20,528 --> 00:30:22,071
He's on the roof!

366
00:30:22,155 --> 00:30:25,575
This is gonna be good.

367
00:30:26,743 --> 00:30:27,952
No.

368
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:33,208
You're kidding me. You're kidding me!

369
00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:36,586
Look at that!

370
00:30:38,338 --> 00:30:39,756
He's a fool, right?

371
00:30:53,728 --> 00:30:55,313
Here they come.

372
00:30:55,396 --> 00:30:57,482
Bye-bye, Nachito.

373
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:24,884
Police! Open up!

374
00:31:26,678 --> 00:31:29,180
We got a fortified door.
Need to breach.

375
00:31:36,854 --> 00:31:37,854
Police!

376
00:31:40,108 --> 00:31:41,276
Clear!

377
00:31:43,194 --> 00:31:44,696
What's happening?

378
00:31:50,577 --> 00:31:52,328
Did they get him?

379
00:31:52,412 --> 00:31:53,412
They must've got...

380
00:32:06,801 --> 00:32:08,177
Ignacio Varga...

381
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,763
You are a badass.

382
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:18,896
Suzanne...

383
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,189
Oh, Suzanne!

384
00:32:20,273 --> 00:32:23,443
Suzanne,
I think we have something in common.

385
00:32:24,485 --> 00:32:28,197
Suzanne,
I think we have something

386
00:32:28,281 --> 00:32:29,532
in common.

387
00:32:33,828 --> 00:32:36,914
Suzanne,
I think we have something in common.

388
00:32:38,207 --> 00:32:39,459
Bill!

389
00:32:39,542 --> 00:32:41,336
- Bill...
- What?

390
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:43,129
Am I on Candid Camera again?

391
00:32:43,212 --> 00:32:45,465
No, but by the way, you look great.

392
00:32:45,548 --> 00:32:47,550
We gotta talk Bruno Leder.

393
00:32:47,634 --> 00:32:49,177
Leder? Lost cause.

394
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,471
- I beg to differ.
- He assaulted a minor.

395
00:32:51,554 --> 00:32:54,098
That oaf? You call him a minor,
I call him a menace.

396
00:32:54,182 --> 00:32:56,476
Hey, my featherweight was simply
defending himself

397
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:57,935
against your raging bull.

398
00:32:58,019 --> 00:32:59,979
No sale.
Leder's doing the full freight.

399
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:01,439
Welcome back to the law, McGill.

400
00:33:01,522 --> 00:33:03,650
It's Goodman. And you'll be back.

401
00:33:05,652 --> 00:33:06,861
- Hannah-Banana.
- Hi!

402
00:33:06,944 --> 00:33:10,114
Hey. What's the word
on moving Tripp to Thursday?

403
00:33:10,198 --> 00:33:12,241
It works on the calendar,
just have to check...

404
00:33:12,325 --> 00:33:13,743
Consider them checked!

405
00:33:13,826 --> 00:33:14,744
Veronica.

406
00:33:14,745 --> 00:33:17,705
- She's finally clear. Go ahead.
- Hey, you got something for me?

407
00:33:21,459 --> 00:33:23,544
Muchas gracias.
All right, let's see.

408
00:33:23,628 --> 00:33:26,255
Long sleeves, covering the tats,
that's excellent.

409
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:29,550
Pull your hair back and lose the hardware.

410
00:33:29,634 --> 00:33:31,928
Her Honour doth protest a chin pillar.

411
00:33:32,011 --> 00:33:34,931
- But it's gonna close up.
- Into every life, a little rain must fall.

412
00:33:35,014 --> 00:33:37,350
Meet me outside Courtroom 103 at 2:15.

413
00:33:37,433 --> 00:33:40,645
Mitch! What say you
to moving Tripp to Thursday?

414
00:33:40,728 --> 00:33:44,107
- Thursday works.
- Great. Thursday.

415
00:33:45,108 --> 00:33:47,360
- What did you do?
- I don't know. What did I do?

416
00:33:47,443 --> 00:33:49,529
Suddenly, Leder has witnesses?

417
00:33:49,612 --> 00:33:51,698
What can I say? People step up.

418
00:33:51,781 --> 00:33:53,116
From the sewer?

419
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:55,118
Life's rich pageant, who are we to judge?

420
00:33:55,201 --> 00:33:57,578
Anyway, they saw what they saw.

421
00:33:57,662 --> 00:34:00,998
Your beefy if youthful hooligan
cold-cocked my small potato.

422
00:34:01,082 --> 00:34:03,793
So, what do you say,
sentence suspended,

423
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:06,963
six months' probation,
70 hours community service?

424
00:34:07,046 --> 00:34:08,756
Yeah, I guess.

425
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,007
That's the spirit.

426
00:34:19,684 --> 00:34:22,019
Suzanne,
I think we have something

427
00:34:22,103 --> 00:34:23,312
in common.

428
00:34:26,357 --> 00:34:29,068
Suzanne,
I think we have something in common.

429
00:34:31,195 --> 00:34:33,990
- Suzanne, I...
- Jimmy!

430
00:34:34,073 --> 00:34:36,451
- Howard, hey.
- Congratulations.

431
00:34:36,534 --> 00:34:38,745
- You're back in the saddle.
- Yeah.

432
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:42,457
So...

433
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,540
Saul Goodman?

434
00:34:45,209 --> 00:34:46,502
Yeah, that's me.

435
00:34:48,004 --> 00:34:49,004
How's business?

436
00:34:49,881 --> 00:34:52,425
It's good. It's very good. You?

437
00:34:52,508 --> 00:34:55,595
Actually, it looks like it's gonna be
one of our best years ever.

438
00:34:55,678 --> 00:34:58,931
I was wondering, any chance
you're available for lunch some time?

439
00:34:59,015 --> 00:35:00,600
Lunch? Lunch? Really?

440
00:35:00,683 --> 00:35:04,771
Yeah. Have Julie call my people.
I'm in the book. See you, Howard.

441
00:35:04,854 --> 00:35:07,231
Suzanne,
I think we have a few things in common.

442
00:35:07,315 --> 00:35:09,108
- Oh, I hope not.
- Oh, we do.

443
00:35:09,192 --> 00:35:11,194
To the tune of 16 cases.

444
00:35:11,277 --> 00:35:13,488
So you're busy, I'm busy.

445
00:35:13,571 --> 00:35:17,825
How about we do a lightning round,
we'll settle these puppies, 20 minutes?

446
00:35:17,909 --> 00:35:19,994
Don't you already have
an appointment with me?

447
00:35:20,077 --> 00:35:21,204
Yeah, next Tuesday.

448
00:35:21,287 --> 00:35:23,831
But, you know,
let's get it done right now.

449
00:35:23,915 --> 00:35:25,625
How about we wait till next Tuesday?

450
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:28,169
My clients need answers.

451
00:35:28,252 --> 00:35:30,463
Look, you've got a problem with me,
that's fine.

452
00:35:30,546 --> 00:35:32,006
Don't take it out on my clients.

453
00:35:32,089 --> 00:35:34,509
This isn't about your clients.
This is about your wallet.

454
00:35:34,592 --> 00:35:36,719
- Okay, slow down...
- You're looking for turnover.

455
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:39,764
You wanna churn through more clients,
make more money.

456
00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:42,391
That's your problem, not mine.

457
00:35:42,475 --> 00:35:44,852
Suzanne, I'm outraged.

458
00:36:11,963 --> 00:36:14,298
They say it's clear out there.

459
00:36:14,382 --> 00:36:16,384
Should I tell the guys to move out?

460
00:36:16,467 --> 00:36:18,803
Ignacio, it's your call.

461
00:36:24,225 --> 00:36:25,225
Okay.

462
00:36:37,613 --> 00:36:39,031
Hey!

463
00:36:39,115 --> 00:36:40,575
Grab two Modelos.

464
00:36:55,423 --> 00:36:56,423
Sit.

465
00:37:20,907 --> 00:37:22,366
Your friend...

466
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:26,119
Krazy-8...

467
00:37:27,663 --> 00:37:28,831
Yeah. Domingo.

468
00:37:29,874 --> 00:37:31,375
I know him a long time.

469
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:34,253
How?

470
00:37:34,337 --> 00:37:36,339
My family knows his family.

471
00:37:40,718 --> 00:37:42,303
Has he ever been inside before?

472
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:45,681
No.

473
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:48,350
You worried about him?

474
00:37:55,107 --> 00:37:57,026
No, man, he'll keep his mouth shut.

475
00:38:15,628 --> 00:38:16,963
You want me to take care of it?

476
00:38:19,924 --> 00:38:21,425
No.

477
00:38:21,509 --> 00:38:23,260
I got something much better for him.

478
00:38:25,596 --> 00:38:26,596
Come on.

479
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:32,645
I need you to call Beau Bindler
and set a meeting for tomorrow a.m.

480
00:38:32,728 --> 00:38:34,563
so we can prep him for the deposition.

481
00:38:34,647 --> 00:38:37,149
- Got it.
- And maybe bring bagels.

482
00:38:37,233 --> 00:38:38,484
The guy eats his feelings.

483
00:38:38,567 --> 00:38:39,777
Bagels, check.

484
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,654
- So yeah. See you tomorrow.
- All right.

485
00:38:43,197 --> 00:38:44,782
Okay, let's review.

486
00:38:44,865 --> 00:38:48,202
Your sister, Nancy, attacked
your girlfriend, also named Nancy,

487
00:38:48,285 --> 00:38:49,537
with a curling iron?

488
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:52,206
I'm gonna need a face-to-face
so I know who I'm representing.

489
00:38:52,289 --> 00:38:54,750
Look, I'm in an elevator.
Now I'm gonna lose you.

490
00:38:54,834 --> 00:38:56,002
Hello? Okay.

491
00:38:58,796 --> 00:39:00,172
Oh, no.

492
00:39:00,256 --> 00:39:01,799
No, no, no.

493
00:39:01,882 --> 00:39:02,925
No!

494
00:39:04,427 --> 00:39:06,345
Hey! Hello?

495
00:39:08,139 --> 00:39:09,807
Hi, this is ADA Ericsen.

496
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:11,934
We're in the south bank of the elevator...

497
00:39:12,018 --> 00:39:14,520
- Goddamn it!
- Please!

498
00:39:14,603 --> 00:39:17,481
Sorry, we're stuck between
floors two and three.

499
00:39:18,774 --> 00:39:19,774
Yeah. How long?

500
00:39:21,944 --> 00:39:22,944
Thanks.

501
00:39:25,531 --> 00:39:26,782
And?

502
00:39:26,866 --> 00:39:28,492
They're sending someone.

503
00:39:28,576 --> 00:39:29,994
It's gonna be a minute.

504
00:39:31,495 --> 00:39:33,581
I can't believe this.

505
00:39:49,597 --> 00:39:53,309
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
I ask you,

506
00:39:53,392 --> 00:39:56,353
what is this trial really about?

507
00:39:58,564 --> 00:40:01,067
The state may call it vandalism,

508
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:05,529
but I call my client's brave act
of social justice

509
00:40:05,613 --> 00:40:08,365
constitutionally-protected free speech.

510
00:40:08,449 --> 00:40:09,784
- Really?
- That...

511
00:40:11,243 --> 00:40:13,287
I gotta use my time.

512
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:15,164
Can you do it silently?

513
00:40:16,165 --> 00:40:17,458
Yeah, sure.

514
00:40:22,213 --> 00:40:27,968
My client is a young man
of deep moral fortitude...

515
00:40:28,052 --> 00:40:30,179
Moral fortitude.

516
00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:31,931
With a passion for progress.

517
00:40:34,767 --> 00:40:35,935
A solid citizen.

518
00:40:36,018 --> 00:40:37,770
No, no, no.

519
00:40:37,853 --> 00:40:40,356
A dedicated citizen

520
00:40:40,439 --> 00:40:43,776
with a voice that needs to ring out!

521
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:44,859
Name one.

522
00:40:46,403 --> 00:40:47,738
I'm sorry?

523
00:40:47,822 --> 00:40:49,031
One of the cases.

524
00:40:50,032 --> 00:40:51,283
One of our cases?

525
00:40:51,367 --> 00:40:53,911
Oh, let me think. Veronica Nix.

526
00:40:53,994 --> 00:40:55,204
Motor vehicle theft?

527
00:40:55,287 --> 00:40:57,123
With mitigating circumstances.

528
00:40:57,206 --> 00:40:58,999
Such as...?

529
00:40:59,083 --> 00:41:00,501
It was her aunt's minivan.

530
00:41:00,584 --> 00:41:02,002
That's already baked in.

531
00:41:02,086 --> 00:41:06,173
It was parked in the driveway.
The old lady was berating her, so...

532
00:41:06,257 --> 00:41:07,215
So what?

533
00:41:07,216 --> 00:41:09,426
So, you know,
good luck finding a jury

534
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:12,012
that's never been reamed out
by a relative.

535
00:41:16,433 --> 00:41:18,310
- One year probation.
- Sold.

536
00:41:18,394 --> 00:41:20,521
- Just like that?
- Yup.

537
00:41:20,604 --> 00:41:22,815
What do you say we look at...

538
00:41:23,774 --> 00:41:25,067
Jerome Sheehan?

539
00:41:26,068 --> 00:41:29,238
So full year supervised for Drew Kirkman?

540
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:31,907
- How about 18 months?
- Eighteen it is.

541
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,786
Next up, we got...

542
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:37,580
Tanika Berman.

543
00:41:40,291 --> 00:41:41,959
Four months jail?

544
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:44,795
The vampire stunt?
That was negligent arson.

545
00:41:44,879 --> 00:41:47,548
Well, it was more of a prank gone wrong.

546
00:41:47,631 --> 00:41:49,675
The knife was real.

547
00:41:49,758 --> 00:41:52,636
Yeah, but it was used as a prop.

548
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,138
Was the fire a prop?

549
00:41:56,015 --> 00:41:58,100
The blood was fake.

550
00:41:58,184 --> 00:42:01,103
- How is that relevant?
- Petty misdemeanour.

551
00:42:02,188 --> 00:42:03,606
Plus fourth-degree felony.

552
00:42:05,149 --> 00:42:07,443
But drop the property damage?

553
00:42:08,444 --> 00:42:10,738
Keep the weapons charge.

554
00:42:10,821 --> 00:42:11,947
Fourteen months jail?

555
00:42:12,031 --> 00:42:13,824
Sixteen.

556
00:42:13,908 --> 00:42:15,743
Sixteen.

557
00:42:15,826 --> 00:42:17,077
Plus fines, TBD.

558
00:42:18,621 --> 00:42:21,415
Plus fines, TBD.

559
00:42:21,498 --> 00:42:22,416
All right.

560
00:42:26,003 --> 00:42:27,463
Oh, hey, look at that.

561
00:42:27,546 --> 00:42:29,173
Oh, finally.

562
00:42:30,966 --> 00:42:33,010
Twenty minutes.

563
00:42:43,646 --> 00:42:45,606
Pleasure doing business with you.

564
00:42:45,689 --> 00:42:47,107
Sure.

565
00:42:47,191 --> 00:42:49,944
See you next week. For the last three!

566
00:42:54,698 --> 00:42:57,117
Legal services for the other half?

567
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,578
So my brother's little problem?

568
00:42:59,662 --> 00:43:02,581
His record will be cleaner
than Doris Day's Greatest Hits.

569
00:43:02,665 --> 00:43:04,291
Catch you on the flip-flop.

570
00:43:15,511 --> 00:43:18,097
Seventy hours is a breeze, trust me.

571
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:20,391
Think of all the good that you'll do.

572
00:43:20,474 --> 00:43:23,102
Bruno, good talking to you.
I gotta jump.

573
00:43:23,185 --> 00:43:25,145
Saul Goodman, speedy justice for you.

574
00:43:25,229 --> 00:43:26,730
Miss Hower!

575
00:43:26,814 --> 00:43:28,607
Hey, have I got good news.

576
00:43:28,691 --> 00:43:31,568
I had to strap on the old armour
and do some jousting, but...

577
00:43:32,653 --> 00:43:36,699
It's what knights used to do
back in olden times...

578
00:43:39,285 --> 00:43:41,287
You know what? I'll call you back.

579
00:43:46,166 --> 00:43:48,752
Mr. Varga, long time no see.

580
00:43:49,753 --> 00:43:50,753
Get in.

581
00:43:55,009 --> 00:43:57,678
Your timing isn't perfect.

582
00:43:57,761 --> 00:43:59,722
I'm a little swamped right now.

583
00:44:04,977 --> 00:44:07,604
We're just going for a ride, or...?
