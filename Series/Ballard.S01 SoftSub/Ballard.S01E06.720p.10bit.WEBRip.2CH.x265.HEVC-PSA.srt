1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:01,710
[Ballard] <i>Previously on</i> Ballard<i>...</i>

2
00:00:01,711 --> 00:00:03,503
[Javi] I didn't kill that dude.
I wouldn't go near him.

3
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:04,713
He's a coyote for the cartel.

4
00:00:04,714 --> 00:00:06,881
Well, if you didn't do it,
then where'd you get the gun?

5
00:00:06,882 --> 00:00:10,135
- It was definitely a cop.
- This guy Anthony Driscoll resigned 2022.

6
00:00:10,136 --> 00:00:12,220
Under the influence of illegal narcotics.

7
00:00:12,221 --> 00:00:14,264
Do you happen to remember
the informant's name?

8
00:00:14,265 --> 00:00:16,266
- Ibarra.
- Luis Ibarra?

9
00:00:16,267 --> 00:00:18,685
- That's it.
- Whatever happened to Ibarra?

10
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:19,978
Disappeared back to Mexico.

11
00:00:19,979 --> 00:00:21,146
And you know that for sure?

12
00:00:21,147 --> 00:00:24,107
Driscoll did. He followed him
all the way down to Jalisco.

13
00:00:24,108 --> 00:00:25,525
Until the trail went cold.

14
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,527
Last time I came for one
of the Brotherhood it didn't go so well.

15
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:29,362
The complaint you filed?
Against Olivas, right?

16
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:31,614
He tried to assault me at a party.

17
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:32,991
[Parker] <i>All this time.</i>

18
00:00:32,992 --> 00:00:35,160
I thought I didn't do enough.

19
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:37,662
I thought maybe I did too much.

20
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:39,748
- [Olivas] Hey...
- [Parker] <i>I thought it was on me.</i>

21
00:00:39,749 --> 00:00:41,624
- I got you, partner.
- <i>I let him take me home.</i>

22
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,334
You didn't let him do anything.

23
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:44,419
Jenny Garrison?

24
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,547
We've got some questions
about a van you scrapped in 2009.

25
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:50,925
{\an8}My ex-husband, Mike, took off
with that van nearly 30 years ago.

26
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:53,428
{\an8}- <i>He ran off with Denise McKenzie.</i>
- [Colleen] I found it.

27
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:57,516
<i>Our records do show a van
was towed from unit E36.</i>

28
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:01,603
<i>Belongs to a Mike Garrison.</i>

29
00:01:01,604 --> 00:01:04,272
- [Laffont] It's Laura Wilson's.
- This is sick.

30
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:06,650
It is. And it stops here.

31
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:11,906
- [siren wailing]
- [police radio chatter]

32
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:13,908
[shutter clicks]

33
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,372
We haven't even finished
processing the crime scene.

34
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:25,293
{\an8}Homicide has more resources
and man power for something this size.

35
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:27,504
[Ballard] These murders have already
fallen through the cracks,

36
00:01:27,505 --> 00:01:30,173
and Homicide is-is overtaxed on hot cases.

37
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:31,925
They're never gonna prioritize this.

38
00:01:31,926 --> 00:01:34,594
Ballard,
you have a small team of volunteers.

39
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:37,806
The same volunteers that got us here.
[sighs]

40
00:01:37,807 --> 00:01:40,809
Sir, we have 14 victims now. At least.

41
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,729
- That's 14 families waiting for answers.
- [phone buzzing]

42
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,898
Why is the chief calling me?

43
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,736
Is there a small chance that
Jake Pearlman might be in her ear?

44
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:54,031
I'm guessing Jake Pearlman
has you in his ear.

45
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:55,825
This is Captain Berchem.

46
00:01:57,493 --> 00:01:59,911
Yes, ma'am. Mm-hmm.

47
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:01,372
I'll see to it right away.

48
00:02:06,544 --> 00:02:07,877
You have 72 hours.

49
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:11,339
Find something meaningful
or this case goes to Homicide.

50
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,800
Thank you, sir.

51
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:53,257
Dad!

52
00:03:02,725 --> 00:03:04,435
[alarm ringing]

53
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:07,605
[alarm ringing]

54
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:09,398
[grunts]

55
00:03:21,744 --> 00:03:22,995
[sighs]

56
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,377
[sighs]

57
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:37,885
[Laffont] Ralph, leave it alone.

58
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:41,388
[sighs]

59
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,119
[sighs]

60
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:08,623
[sighs]

61
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:11,084
The second I lease the place,
you gotta be out.

62
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:13,671
- Cool?
- The LAPD appreciates you.

63
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:43,992
[Martina] We have 65 hours

64
00:04:43,993 --> 00:04:46,036
- and 34 minutes.
- [sighs]

65
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:49,122
If you want,
I can sync the countdown to your phone.

66
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:51,416
Uh, no. The one in my head is plenty.
Thanks.

67
00:04:51,417 --> 00:04:53,668
[stammers] This-This deadline's
like a real thing?

68
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:56,170
Yeah. And if we don't move the needle,
the case goes back to Homicide.

69
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:57,964
We saw how well that went
for Jake and his family.

70
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,257
[Ballard] If we wanna keep this case,

71
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:01,468
it's all-hands, all the time,
until we break ground.

72
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:03,052
Lion's Mane tea?

73
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:05,055
All the benefits of coffee,
none of the pesticides.

74
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:08,599
I'm good. I just had more dreams
than sleep.

75
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,560
Special delivery from Darcy.

76
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:14,605
Fourteen processed souvenirs,
fresh from the lab.

77
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,191
[Parker] All 14?

78
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:18,609
Lab work got faster while I was gone?

79
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,778
Apparently, there's not much to do
when everything's been wiped cleaned.

80
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:25,033
And before you ask, any test
you'd want Darcy to run, she ran.

81
00:05:25,034 --> 00:05:26,492
- Twice.
- Jesus. [sighs]

82
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:29,120
Garrison scrubbed
every nook and cranny. [sighs]

83
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:30,663
Well, that's ominous.

84
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,124
All right. Let's see if we can connect
these to any other open cases.

85
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,001
Rawls, can you spread these out
in the conference room?

86
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:36,420
Guys, can you finish the boards?

87
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,717
[Laffont sighs]

88
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:44,720
- [Ballard] We good?
- We're good.

89
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:47,890
Anthony Driscoll's... [sighs]

90
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:50,434
...home sweet home.

91
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:54,438
Mmm. Would've thought
the cartel paid better.

92
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:57,273
Well, this guy's been getting away
with murder for five years.

93
00:05:57,274 --> 00:06:00,234
He knows how to fly under the radar.
Do we have to monitor this?

94
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:04,072
I set up an alert.
He makes an appearance, we'll know it.

95
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:06,199
- Assuming he's even in LA.
- [Laffont chuckles]

96
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,328
You sure you got enough, uh,
brain space for another case?

97
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:11,996
Berchem's clock is ticking loudly.

98
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:14,707
Well, we're juggling
a police conspiracy and a serial killer,

99
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,168
so it's not like we can
put either of them on hold.

100
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:19,128
Hey, do we have an update
on Ibarra's girlfriend?

101
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,381
I got better than an update.
I got her name.

102
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:23,634
Abril Cortez.

103
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:27,261
I've been trading with the Federales,
and they're looking for her family now.

104
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:30,682
I mean, maybe we get lucky,
find out her and Gael are with them.

105
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,435
Gael? That's the baby's name?

106
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,523
Gael Ibarra. Turns 6 in December.

107
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,377
- Hey, Angela?
- Mmm.

108
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:03,799
Javier Fuentes is a half hour late to PT.
Is someone bringing him up, or...

109
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:05,633
That's an old schedule.

110
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:08,137
- He got moved to K-10.
- Huh.

111
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:10,180
When was this?

112
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:17,937
[sniffles]

113
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,398
Oh. Hey.

114
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,151
[sighs]

115
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:24,527
Didn't realize you guys were stopping by.

116
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:27,030
- Teddy, it's good to see you.
- Ballard called us.

117
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:29,366
Told us what you guys found last night.

118
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:31,076
Fourteen victims.

119
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:35,538
Jake. Mr. Pearlman.
Thanks for coming on such short notice.

120
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:38,709
- I promise this won't take long.
- Of course. Talk later?

121
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:41,503
This way.

122
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:44,213
Appreciate you, uh,
poking the chief last night.

123
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,133
My captain gave us a little more road.

124
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:00,355
This is the guy?

125
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,150
Looks like it.

126
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:09,990
[phone chimes]

127
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:32,595
Jake, meet Officer Parker.

128
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:34,180
Hi. [sighs]

129
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,182
This is my father, Gary Pearlman.

130
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:37,851
Nice to meet you, sir.

131
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:43,356
[sighs]

132
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:45,150
There's so many of them.

133
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:49,446
We've linked some of them
to other victims already.

134
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:55,660
I know it's been a long time,

135
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:59,414
but if you could identify anything of
Sarah's, it would really help us out.

136
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:10,801
[sighs]

137
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:16,848
I mean, some of this, it's-it's just junk.

138
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:19,600
Why would anyone...

139
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:21,645
To him, I'm sure, it means something.

140
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:23,855
But you're right.

141
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:26,108
They're just trinkets.

142
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:31,196
Dad. Anything?

143
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,031
[sighs]

144
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:35,324
I-I-I'm sorry.

145
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:39,204
My wife, she would've been
so much better at this.

146
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:43,709
It's okay.

147
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,840
[sighs] I hate what this is doing to him.

148
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,676
I know. Don't worry.

149
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:54,970
We'll connect Garrison to Sarah
some other way.

150
00:09:58,056 --> 00:09:59,850
[phone buzzing]

151
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:01,934
Hey, Tutu. What's up?

152
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,644
- [Tutu] <i>What day is it?</i>
- [Ballard] What?

153
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:05,480
It's, uh, Thursday.

154
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:07,690
- Shit.
- [Tutu] <i>Exactly.</i>

155
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:11,402
<i>My plane leaves in an hour and a half,
and my ride forgot me.</i>

156
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:13,946
- <i>Didn't you see my texts all morning?</i>
- [stammers]

157
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,490
Darcy called.
Asked you to meet her at the lab.

158
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:17,826
- Said it's important.
- [stammers]

159
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:21,538
Tutu, I gotta go. I-I'm so sorry.

160
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,373
Call me when you land, okay?

161
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:25,876
- I love you.
- [line beeps]

162
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:28,170
[sighs]

163
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:31,173
[phone rings]

164
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:38,888
Well, hello, Nurse Savina.

165
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:40,097
<i>It's been a while.</i>

166
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:43,267
[Savina] I heard something interesting
about one of the names you flagged.

167
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:44,685
Javier Fuentes.

168
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:48,439
- <i>Apparently he got moved to K-10.</i>
- What's interesting about that?

169
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,648
- <i>The timing.</i>
- [sniffles]

170
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,402
It happened pretty soon after
a couple of detectives paid him a visit.

171
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,573
<i>Don't know if one thing has anything
to do with the other, but, you know,</i>

172
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,408
it usually does.

173
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,792
You got names for these detectives?
[sniffs]

174
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:08,502
Outside my purview.

175
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:10,879
You wanna know more? I gotta make more.

176
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:22,640
Darcy. You said you needed to see me?

177
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:25,893
Uh, yeah. That DNA you collected
from Garrison's daughter,

178
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:27,395
it got a definite match.

179
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:28,521
Okay.

180
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:30,065
Just don't shoot the messenger, okay?

181
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:34,443
The hit was to a cold case
up in Crestline.

182
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:36,071
A John Doe found in the mountains.

183
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,784
Detective, meet Mike Garrison.

184
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,706
Wait. It says that his body
was recovered in 1997.

185
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,166
That's correct.

186
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:52,379
How can that be? That predates
everything in my case's timeline.

187
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:55,507
I'm sorry.
I guess Garrison isn't your guy.

188
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:00,928
[grunting]

189
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,722
[pants]

190
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:11,314
[radio chatter]

191
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:15,694
Picking up a murder book
for a 1997 John Doe.

192
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:19,072
Hey, Cap. Someone here for ya.

193
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,370
LAPD. Here about Five Points.

194
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:29,416
- Morning. Detective Renée Ballard.
- Captain Paula Hopkinson.

195
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,375
Didn't know you were driving up.

196
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,002
I could've had one of my guys
bring it to you.

197
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:35,129
Oh, thanks. I'm just up against the clock.

198
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,632
Mmm. Thought you were
supposed to be cold cases.

199
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:48,351
Elk hunters found the body
a couple of miles outside Five Points.

200
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:53,439
Grid sweep turned up
a bunch of trash and no ID.

201
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,899
Body was in rough shape.

202
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,610
No match to a missing person.

203
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:59,321
Wasn't much we could do but write it up.

204
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,989
- [sighs]
- Look.

205
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,325
I was a detective myself back then.

206
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:07,328
You gotta do a lot more
with a lot less around here.

207
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:10,081
But the fact you have a murder book at
all is 'cause my people were thorough.

208
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,167
Oh, no judgment from me.

209
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:16,254
My killer's been leaving a lot of
thin murder books in his wake.

210
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:17,839
He's careful.

211
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:22,384
[sighs] You said you were here in '97?

212
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:27,681
Garrison was traveling with a girlfriend,
Denise McKenzie, early 20s.

213
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,350
She disappeared around the same time.

214
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:30,434
Could've met the same end.

215
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,270
Maybe the killer dumped
the bodies separately.

216
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:42,321
Winter of 1999.

217
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:45,408
Jane Doe found ten miles
from your Garrison.

218
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:50,871
ME determined she was mid-20s,
Caucasian female.

219
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:55,209
But her COD was different from that fella.
He was stabbed over a dozen times.

220
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,712
- And Jane Doe?
- Manual strangulation.

221
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:03,426
Body was too decomposed to get DNA.
You'll need dental records.

222
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:08,640
So, serial killer, huh?

223
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,392
You got a name?

224
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:13,061
I thought I did.

225
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,149
[Ted] Goddamn it!

226
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:25,364
Why the hell is it always
two steps back with this case?

227
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,616
We identified two new victims.

228
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,244
That's progress.

229
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:33,581
But we lost our lead suspect.
And we only have a day and a half left.

230
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:35,207
I mean, this sucks.

231
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:38,127
You're not wrong.
But we can't let that stop us.

232
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:42,590
Mike and Denise were found
within a ten mile radius near Crestline.

233
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:44,758
Neither of them had
anything identifiable on them,

234
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:47,136
so the cops up there
didn't realize they were linked.

235
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:48,971
Denise was strangled
like the rest of vics,

236
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:52,475
and the ME report says that Garrison was
stabbed in the neck and chest.

237
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:55,937
So she was the target.
Mike was an obstacle.

238
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,816
Maybe interrupted the killer mid-attack,
made him angrier.

239
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:04,903
[sighs] We're too focused
on the suspects over here.

240
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,866
We need to get back to the victims.
Back to their commonalities.

241
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:10,326
Rawls, Colleen.

242
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:12,786
I need you to start comparing
the backgrounds of the ones that we know.

243
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:13,954
Find a link.

244
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:16,499
The rest of you... [sighs]

245
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,792
...you focus on
the unknown victims, all right?

246
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:22,630
Deep dive on these souvenirs.
The sunglasses, the journal.

247
00:15:22,631 --> 00:15:24,340
Those have the most promise.

248
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:26,342
If we can identify more
of the killer's targets,

249
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:28,345
we have a better chance
of finding this overlap.

250
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:31,806
- [sighs]
- [Colleen sighs] Okay.

251
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:38,604
Rawls.

252
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:39,772
Mmm.

253
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:41,733
This guy is smart, but he's not perfect.

254
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,194
He just needs to have made one mistake.

255
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:25,485
[Javi screaming, grunts]

256
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:32,701
Hey. I got something.

257
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:38,288
Souvenir number six.

258
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:40,458
{\an8}A pin from the 2008
Hillary Clinton campaign.

259
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:43,711
I cross-referenced through ViCAP,
CAMS, and a few others.

260
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:47,006
And I finally got a hit to
an open cold case in Valley Village.

261
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:51,593
Josie Culver. Age 29.
Worked on the campaign.

262
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:52,929
Strangled in her bedroom.

263
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:56,558
Mom reported the button missing
from the crime scene after her death.

264
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:58,684
Apparently,
Josie was never seen without it.

265
00:16:58,685 --> 00:16:59,810
Okay, great.

266
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:01,687
Let's pull Josie's file from the stacks.

267
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:02,814
[phone chimes]

268
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,199
I did a deep dive on him for a month
after RHD benched me.

269
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:15,285
Looking for the right dirt.

270
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:19,163
It wasn't good for me,
and it won't be good for you either.

271
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:20,665
I was gonna block him.

272
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:22,583
But I thought...

273
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:24,210
I thought maybe I'd call him out.

274
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:26,712
[sighs]

275
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,881
'Cause everyone commenting just sees the...

276
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:30,759
the man he's pretending to be.

277
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:33,845
This-This white knight.

278
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:43,229
[sighs] Are we the only ones
who see him for who he really is?

279
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:45,398
[sighs] I don't know.

280
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,065
[knocks on door]

281
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,986
Driscoll's back. Wanna find out
what he's up to, now's the time.

282
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:52,697
You guys go.

283
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:55,450
Um, I'll keep the trains running here.

284
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:22,434
Dad!

285
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:23,644
[gasps]

286
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:25,396
- [pants]
- You okay?

287
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:27,731
I didn't realize you fell asleep.

288
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:31,110
Sorry. I didn't mean to. I... Oh, wow.

289
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,737
Uh, everything good?

290
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:35,781
Yeah. I saw some movement in the house.

291
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:38,785
Um, also, your phone kept buzzing.

292
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:41,912
[sighs]

293
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:43,288
- [chuckles]
- What?

294
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:46,083
Uh, friend of mine is over at
Ghost Sando Shop.

295
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:47,167
Offered to bring us some.

296
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:48,794
I like sandos.

297
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:49,878
Yeah, you do.

298
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,631
- [keypad clicks]
- [Laffont chuckles]

299
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:53,550
Uh-uh.

300
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,676
Yuca's over on Hillhurst?

301
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:58,929
Tiny little taco shack
in the middle of the parking lot.

302
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:02,224
- That's the best burgers in LA.
- No, it's Fatburger, my guy.

303
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:03,642
You can't mess with perfection.

304
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:07,938
You are young and LAFD.
Two reasons not to take you seriously.

305
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:09,857
- [laughs]
- He's lifeguard division.

306
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:11,191
So he's County Fire.

307
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:13,944
- Ooh. Same difference.
- [chuckles]

308
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:15,737
Actually, I may end up being both.

309
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:16,989
What do you mean?

310
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:21,243
I'm doing a paramedic training shift
at the Calabasas firehouse.

311
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:23,161
See if I can get in there
and still work the beach.

312
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,789
Ballard.

313
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,460
Aaron. I'm sorry, you gotta hop out.

314
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:32,796
Head south.
Do a lap before you go back to your car.

315
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:35,048
- Thank you for the sandwiches.
- Sure. No prob.

316
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:36,843
I got a plain turkey for Lola.

317
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:42,891
- Friend?
- Don't start.

318
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:03,161
[sighs]

319
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:39,781
[sighs] No way we can follow him
in there without him seeing.

320
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:54,629
Someone was waiting for him.

321
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:57,799
Jesus. He's still in with the cops.

322
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:03,388
There's another deck up there.
Maybe we can get a different angle.

323
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:32,124
Division number on that shop is 06.

324
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,501
What's a Hollywood black-and-white
doing in Inglewood?

325
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:37,421
- [operator] <i>Communications.</i>
- Hey. This is Detective Renée Ballard.

326
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:40,048
Uh, can you settle a bet
between my partner and I?

327
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:43,552
You got any Hollywood black-and-whites
code 6 in Inglewood right now?

328
00:21:43,553 --> 00:21:45,470
[operator] <i>Negative. Not today.</i>

329
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:47,515
Just won me ten bucks. Thank you.

330
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:52,478
Go on. Open it up. Check it out.

331
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:01,528
You all good? You know what to do?

332
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:03,989
- Everything cool? You seem kinda...
- Yeah, yeah. All is good.

333
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:07,284
Just, uh, heading out of town for a bit.
Personal business.

334
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:08,536
Might miss my flight.

335
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:10,996
[Ballard] We gotta get that shop number.

336
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:13,040
If we know who signed it out,
we know who's dirty.

337
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:15,042
Think we'd have a better angle
on a different level?

338
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:17,294
I don't wanna draw attention
switching levels.

339
00:22:17,295 --> 00:22:18,379
I'm gonna go on foot.

340
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:26,470
Anything else?

341
00:22:26,471 --> 00:22:27,847
No. Dismissed.

342
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,278
Christ.

343
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:46,740
- Yeah.
- On the move.

344
00:22:46,741 --> 00:22:48,743
- Northeast exit.
- Shit.

345
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:55,541
[panting]

346
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:04,258
Damn it!

347
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:16,186
[Parker] So you think Driscoll's running?

348
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:18,188
Well, he didn't go home
after we lost him last night.

349
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:20,065
So that's not a good sign.

350
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:23,693
I heard back from
the Federales about Abril Cortez.

351
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:25,320
Please tell me she's alive.

352
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:27,740
She is. Also, she's here.

353
00:23:28,533 --> 00:23:30,033
Living over in Bell Gardens.

354
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:31,327
That's 30 minutes away.

355
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,578
Any updates on Gael?

356
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,039
Still a mystery.

357
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:37,166
He's not with her.

358
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:39,127
Keep looking.

359
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:45,590
You think Abril could help us
find something on Driscoll?

360
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:49,428
Maybe. I mean, at the very least, she
deserves to know what happened to Luis.

361
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,389
Anyway, Berchem's gonna be
breathing down my neck

362
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,141
any second on this Pearlman case, so...

363
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:55,518
We got till end of day, right?

364
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:57,269
Yeah.

365
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,521
Abril's gonna have to wait.

366
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:06,695
[Colleen]
Person working for the campaign said

367
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:09,740
Josie Culver left the office
that night around 7:00 p.m.

368
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:12,826
Her body was discovered by her roommate
the following afternoon.

369
00:24:12,827 --> 00:24:14,536
Any similarities with the other victims?

370
00:24:14,537 --> 00:24:17,581
Only cause of death.
Otherwise, they're all different ages,

371
00:24:17,582 --> 00:24:19,916
different body types,
different socioeconomic status.

372
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:21,294
They're just different.

373
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,837
Like he chose them
off the street at random.

374
00:24:23,838 --> 00:24:25,380
Wait. Her roommate wasn't home that night?

375
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:27,382
No. She was in San Diego.

376
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:30,093
Apparently, she went down there for work
every other weekend.

377
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:32,471
- [Ballard] Mm-hmm.
- I take it back.

378
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:34,097
He was watching her.

379
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:37,309
[Ballard] Yeah. If he's patient enough to
track the roommates comings and goings,

380
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,643
he's methodical.

381
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:40,563
He's not choosing these women randomly.

382
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:44,233
[sighs] There's just something
we're not seeing.

383
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:47,236
[phone buzzing]

384
00:24:47,862 --> 00:24:49,405
Keep digging. I gotta take this.

385
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:55,493
Damani, what's up?

386
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,787
Someone knows you met with my client.

387
00:24:57,788 --> 00:24:59,873
Wait. What? What happened?

388
00:24:59,874 --> 00:25:01,833
Javi got attacked in the showers.

389
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:03,168
Is he still alive?

390
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:04,295
<i>Yeah, well, for now.</i>

391
00:25:05,463 --> 00:25:06,714
Look, he's in a coma.

392
00:25:07,298 --> 00:25:09,966
He took nine lacerations to the gut
with a rusty can lid.

393
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:12,261
<i>Went systemic before he got to the OR.</i>

394
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:15,972
Look, Ballard, are you sure
your people are locked down?

395
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:18,475
I can guarantee
there's no leak on my side.

396
00:25:18,476 --> 00:25:19,976
Is he under 24-hour surveillance?

397
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:21,686
Yeah, yeah. I'm here now.

398
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:23,564
Had to get a court order
so they'd let me in.

399
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,150
<i>But the word's out, Detective.</i>

400
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,194
People know he talked.

401
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:33,657
[Parker]
Is this Driscoll's hit or the cartel's?

402
00:25:33,658 --> 00:25:36,076
Driscoll's the one who goes down
if Javi testifies.

403
00:25:36,077 --> 00:25:38,161
If he learns the hit failed,
he'll disappear.

404
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:40,081
We can't just sit around
and wait for him to surface.

405
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:43,083
Abril?

406
00:25:43,084 --> 00:25:45,835
She's the only move we got left.
Laffont and I will go talk to her.

407
00:25:45,836 --> 00:25:48,672
You stay here and keep the team
grinding on souvenirs.

408
00:25:48,673 --> 00:25:51,759
We found more victims. That's great.
We need to find a suspect.

409
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:54,345
[sighs]

410
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:00,935
[sniffs]

411
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:03,770
I normally wouldn't encourage
this kind of thing,

412
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:07,275
but you look like you could use one
and we have a deadline, so...

413
00:26:09,527 --> 00:26:10,778
[chuckles]

414
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:13,531
Man, I thought we got the bastard.

415
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:17,285
Turns out he got us.

416
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:19,912
I know you want justice for Jake.

417
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:21,789
We all do.

418
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:23,332
Have faith.

419
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:26,544
[sighs] Okay.

420
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:30,381
[music playing through headphones]

421
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,976
Is this your first notification
since you retired?

422
00:26:42,977 --> 00:26:44,061
I haven't missed it.

423
00:26:44,562 --> 00:26:48,064
Deliver the worst news of someone's life,
and then badger them for information.

424
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:50,359
- Never sat right with me.
- [phone buzzing]

425
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:52,111
It's Berchem.

426
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,697
Hey, you're gonna have to
talk to him at some point.

427
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:58,366
Well, I'll talk to him
when I have something to say.

428
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,535
We still got time.

429
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:02,204
[sighs]

430
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:05,749
- Abril Cortez?
- Yes.

431
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,500
Can I help you?

432
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:09,503
We're here to talk to you
about Luis Ibarra.

433
00:27:12,048 --> 00:27:14,716
[Abril] Luis said that we could trust him.

434
00:27:14,717 --> 00:27:17,886
I only knew him as the man on the phone

435
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:20,681
who was going to
get us away from the cartel.

436
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:26,729
[cries] How did we miss what he was?

437
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,482
He was supposed to save us.

438
00:27:30,191 --> 00:27:32,943
I never thought he was the one.

439
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,906
You, uh, suspected someone else?

440
00:27:38,616 --> 00:27:42,160
[stammers] There was
a-a soldado from the cartel.

441
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:44,330
His name was Jesus.

442
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:45,956
Jesus Velasco.

443
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:50,210
And Luis was worried that
Jesus knew about the DEA.

444
00:27:50,211 --> 00:27:51,796
That he was working with them.

445
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:56,883
Does the cartel has my son?

446
00:27:56,884 --> 00:27:58,676
We don't think so.

447
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:02,013
The Federales believe
that if Gael was with Luis,

448
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:04,057
then their bodies
would've been left together.

449
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:05,434
To send a message.

450
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,561
[sighs, cries]

451
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:11,357
We are going to keep looking for him.

452
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:17,654
He might have, uh, wound up in
foster care or got sent across the border.

453
00:28:17,655 --> 00:28:18,864
Okay.

454
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:21,200
May I?

455
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,410
- Uh, yes.
- I...

456
00:28:23,411 --> 00:28:26,205
- And I have more of those if you...
- Thank you.

457
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:32,962
[stammers] You said that there was
a video of-of Luis with Gael.

458
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:35,297
Can I see it?

459
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:44,890
[chuckles]

460
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:49,478
[cries]

461
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:57,445
Can I-Can I watch it again, please?

462
00:28:58,195 --> 00:28:59,447
[cries, sniffles]

463
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:07,329
[sighs, inhales sharply]

464
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:13,501
It's only a few hits for Jesus Velasco
on the LAPD database,

465
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:14,711
but this guy's a piece of work.

466
00:29:14,712 --> 00:29:18,798
He's been deported twice in three years
for assault and attempted murder.

467
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,133
He's suspected of a lot more.

468
00:29:20,134 --> 00:29:23,178
Multiple deportations,
but the cartel keeps bringing him back.

469
00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:24,263
He's valuable.

470
00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:26,599
Oh, shit.

471
00:29:27,183 --> 00:29:30,852
Two years before Luis was killed,
Jesus was arrested in a drug raid.

472
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:32,353
Arrested and kicked free.

473
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:34,397
Do you wanna guess
who the arresting officer was?

474
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:36,108
Driscoll. Jesus.

475
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:38,401
Guy's rubbing elbows with monsters.

476
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:41,489
Way worse.
He's putting 'em back on the street.

477
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:09,641
Where is everyone?

478
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:11,392
Berchem sent them home.

479
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:14,104
He dropped by,
said you were dodging his calls.

480
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:17,232
And when he saw Mike Garrison's
name on the victim board,

481
00:30:17,233 --> 00:30:18,692
he figured out what happened.

482
00:30:20,069 --> 00:30:22,238
Homicide comes in the morning
to collect everything.

483
00:30:23,364 --> 00:30:25,741
- How'd the team take it?
- Not well.

484
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:30,453
Ballard, Martina looked into
those sunglasses.

485
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:32,665
They were a limited edition run.

486
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:34,667
Came out six months ago.

487
00:30:38,254 --> 00:30:39,588
He's still active.

488
00:30:52,101 --> 00:30:53,435
You sure you don't want me to stay?

489
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:56,146
No. You-You go.

490
00:30:57,273 --> 00:30:59,275
It's not even our case anymore. [scoffs]

491
00:30:59,942 --> 00:31:00,942
I'll box everything up.

492
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:03,654
- Okay.
- [inhales sharply]

493
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:33,517
[phone chimes]

494
00:31:51,452 --> 00:31:52,452
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

495
00:31:52,453 --> 00:31:55,121
<i>Uh, come on down
and get to know your LAPD.</i>

496
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:56,539
<i>There is plenty to eat.</i>

497
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:59,167
<i>And I promise, you're not gonna regret it
because these things are awesome.</i>

498
00:31:59,168 --> 00:32:02,046
<i>Right? Yeah.</i> [laughs]

499
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:13,849
[door closes]

500
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:17,393
Have you moved at all since I left?

501
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:19,146
- [chuckles]
- It's been an hour.

502
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,816
[chuckles] Guess I lost track.

503
00:32:28,739 --> 00:32:30,616
Really didn't miss that part of the job.

504
00:32:31,367 --> 00:32:32,368
I know.

505
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:38,415
I showed her some security footage.

506
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:41,293
And she asked to see it over and over.

507
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,047
Asked to get a copy.

508
00:32:48,509 --> 00:32:52,345
I just can't imagine going back to her

509
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:55,057
with more bad news
if we don't find this kid.

510
00:32:57,768 --> 00:33:00,771
[sighs]

511
00:33:01,814 --> 00:33:04,358
[chattering]

512
00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:15,119
[Olivas] So the boys still up?

513
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:18,330
I got leftovers. [laughs] Yeah.

514
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:19,998
Yeah.

515
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:27,255
Hey, I'm at my car.

516
00:33:27,256 --> 00:33:28,632
I'll be home in 20.

517
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:30,968
Love you too.

518
00:33:33,554 --> 00:33:35,764
Zamira.

519
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:43,897
I heard that the councilman
made you a reserve.

520
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:46,024
It's nice.

521
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,402
You thinking about going sworn?

522
00:33:49,737 --> 00:33:53,156
'Cause-'Cause if you need a good word,
I am more than happy to help.

523
00:33:53,157 --> 00:33:55,116
Like you helped me home that night?

524
00:33:55,117 --> 00:33:57,161
[chuckles]

525
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:58,953
Oh, <i>mijita</i>.

526
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:01,998
Look, I-I can see that
you are still upset about

527
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:04,333
how things went south between us,
and I'm very sorry...

528
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:05,586
You raped me.

529
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:16,013
Then you spent months gaslighting me
into thinking it was a bad hookup.

530
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:22,603
And it worked for a while.

531
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:28,066
You're a monster.

532
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:32,321
You hide it well, but I can see you.

533
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:35,741
And I'm not the only one.

534
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,579
You think that bullshit up
all by yourself?

535
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:43,916
Or maybe you had a little help?

536
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:46,293
[chuckles]

537
00:34:48,337 --> 00:34:49,671
That's it, isn't it?

538
00:34:51,215 --> 00:34:55,135
Yeah. You and Ballard
in your little knitting circle,

539
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:59,097
looking for anybody else
to blame except yourselves.

540
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:00,724
Mmm.

541
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:04,561
Well, I'm not gonna be your scapegoat.

542
00:35:07,064 --> 00:35:10,442
I didn't do anything
either one of you didn't want.

543
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:16,532
But even if I did, let me tell you
how it's gonna look from the outside.

544
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:20,577
See, Ballard cried wolf, and it backfired.

545
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:26,374
Now, you coming out with
a similar "claim" after all these years?

546
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:29,961
And only a couple of months after Ballard
brought you right back into the fold?

547
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:31,421
[clicks tongue] Mm-mmm.

548
00:35:33,674 --> 00:35:36,093
It's gonna look like you're the one
leading the witch hunt now.

549
00:35:37,845 --> 00:35:41,139
Yeah. Oh. [sighs] Gotta go.

550
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:43,892
Family time.

551
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:48,564
Excuse me.

552
00:35:58,198 --> 00:35:59,408
Hey, partner.

553
00:36:01,702 --> 00:36:02,744
Need a ride home?

554
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:28,103
[sighs]

555
00:36:33,984 --> 00:36:34,985
[mutters]

556
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:41,074
[sighs]

557
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:03,764
[chuckles]

558
00:37:10,312 --> 00:37:12,063
Captain, I'm glad I caught you.

559
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,606
You got a lot of nerve coming here

560
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:15,608
after keeping me in the dark
about Mike Garrison.

561
00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:19,445
Sir, I didn't wanna give you bad news
until I had good news, and now I have it.

562
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:20,905
You're gonna need more
than another Jane Doe.

563
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:24,408
It's not a Jane Doe.
I found a closed case from 2008.

564
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:25,952
The victim was strangled in her bed.

565
00:37:25,953 --> 00:37:28,704
The family reported a gold bracelet
missing from the scene.

566
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:30,247
If it's a closed case, they solved it.

567
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,874
We found that bracelet...

568
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:34,794
[breathes heavily]
...among our killer's souvenirs.

569
00:37:34,795 --> 00:37:37,964
The victim's boyfriend was convicted,
but he always claimed innocence.

570
00:37:37,965 --> 00:37:39,590
If we reopen this case,

571
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:42,677
we might find a link between
the women and the real killer.

572
00:37:42,678 --> 00:37:45,096
And we could potentially
free an innocent man.

573
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:46,181
[scoffs]

574
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:50,143
Ballard, honestly, I don't know
if I should be annoyed or impressed.

575
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:54,898
You can keep the case. For now.

576
00:37:55,816 --> 00:37:58,026
Go home, get some sleep.
You look exhausted.

577
00:37:58,902 --> 00:37:59,903
Thank you, sir.

578
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:07,911
[sighs]

579
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:19,589
Lola.

580
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:22,259
Hi.

581
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,637
- Come here, you. Oh.
- [whining]

582
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:27,597
Hi, honey.

583
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,891
You wanna go out for a pee?

584
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:31,643
Let's do it.

585
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:34,855
[sighs] Come on, baby.

586
00:38:56,752 --> 00:39:00,464
[sighs, breathes deeply]

587
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:11,975
[waves lapping]

588
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:35,957
Dad!

589
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:48,553
Dad!

590
00:39:49,471 --> 00:39:50,722
Dad!

591
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:55,352
- [gasps, grunts, groans]
- [Lola barking]

592
00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:58,730
[Ballard groans]

593
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:04,069
- [yelling, grunting]
- [grunts]

594
00:40:11,785 --> 00:40:13,078
[grunting, groaning]

595
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:16,956
[both scream]

596
00:40:16,957 --> 00:40:18,583
[Ballard breathing heavily]

597
00:40:20,544 --> 00:40:22,170
- [attacker screams]
- [screams]

598
00:40:24,965 --> 00:40:26,675
- [grunting]
- [attacker grunts]

599
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:37,477
[grunting]

600
00:40:41,398 --> 00:40:43,233
[barking continues]

601
00:40:44,818 --> 00:40:46,735
[panting]

602
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:49,572
[wheezing]

603
00:40:49,573 --> 00:40:51,866
- [line rings]
- [dispatcher] <i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

604
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:55,911
This is Detective Renée Ballard, LAPD.
I was attacked in my home.

605
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:58,372
Suspect needs immediate medical attention.

606
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:00,749
[dispatcher] <i>I have an ambulance en route.
ETA is five minutes.</i>

607
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:03,086
- That's too long.
- [dispatcher] <i>The paramedics will be--</i>

608
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:05,212
[line ringing]

609
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:08,465
- [Aaron, through phone] <i>Renée?</i>
- Aaron, someone broke into my house.

610
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,342
- [Aaron] <i>What?</i>
- I crushed his windpipe.

611
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:13,304
- [Aaron] <i>Jesus. Call 911.</i>
- I did that, there's no time.

612
00:41:13,305 --> 00:41:15,514
I need to get him breathing. What do I do?

613
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:17,474
[Aaron] <i>You could do a field trache,
but that's insane.</i>

614
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,351
- <i>I--</i>
- Walk me through it.

615
00:41:19,352 --> 00:41:22,479
- [Aaron] <i>No, Renée, you need training.</i>
- This guy has names, goddamn it!

616
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,274
If he dies, everyone gets away with it!

617
00:41:25,275 --> 00:41:27,776
[breathes shakily] I have a knife.
Tell me what to do.

618
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:30,613
[Aaron sighs] <i>Okay. Okay. Christ.</i>

619
00:41:30,614 --> 00:41:33,532
<i>Tip his head back and trace
along the front of his neck.</i>

620
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:37,369
<i>Find the gap between the Adam's apple
and the ring below it.</i>

621
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:38,454
[Ballard] I got it.

622
00:41:38,455 --> 00:41:41,541
[Aaron] <i>Make a vertical incision
a half inch deep to create an opening.</i>

623
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,628
- [Aaron] <i>Do you have a tube?</i>
- Shit! [grunts]

624
00:41:45,629 --> 00:41:47,631
<i>You need a tube. You need a tube.</i>

625
00:41:51,051 --> 00:41:52,260
<i>Oh, God. Hurry.</i>

626
00:41:56,348 --> 00:41:57,598
- <i>If you don't hurry...</i>
- [grunts]

627
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,559
- <i>...you're gonna lose him.</i>
- Shit.

628
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:02,687
[grunting]

629
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,690
I got it. [pants] Now what?

630
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:08,234
<i>Okay. Push the tube into the incision</i>

631
00:42:08,235 --> 00:42:10,612
<i>until you feel it
go through the trachea wall.</i>

632
00:42:13,198 --> 00:42:15,491
- <i>Did you do it? Hello?</i>
- [gasps, pants]

633
00:42:15,492 --> 00:42:18,577
- He's breathing.
- <i>Okay. Okay. Well, what's going on--</i>

634
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:20,412
[pants]

635
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:21,956
I got you, you motherfucker.

636
00:42:21,957 --> 00:42:24,417
[gurgling sound]

637
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:33,927
No!

638
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:37,430
- [grunting, panting]
- [Lola barking]

639
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:50,318
Goddamn it! No, no, no, no.

640
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:54,030
[barking continues]

641
00:43:01,538 --> 00:43:04,082
[panting]

642
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,962
[panting continues]

643
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:14,926
[siren wailing in distance]
