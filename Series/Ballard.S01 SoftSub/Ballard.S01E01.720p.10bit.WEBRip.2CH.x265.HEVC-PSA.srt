[panting]

3
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:18,310
Stop! LAPD!

4
00:00:22,732 --> 00:00:24,733
- [grunts]
- [shouts in Hindi]

5
00:00:24,734 --> 00:00:25,860
[grunts]

6
00:00:26,402 --> 00:00:28,654
- Down, lady.
- [exclaims, screams]

7
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:34,827
[suspect grunts]

8
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:58,767
- Stay down.
- [grunting]

9
00:00:58,768 --> 00:01:00,560
- Stay, stay.
- [breathes shakily]

10
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:01,936
You okay?

11
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:03,813
- [panting] Yeah, I'm fine.
- [suspect grunts, groans]

12
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:05,732
Windel here's gonna need a doctor though.

13
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:07,066
- [grunts]
- [radio chatter]

14
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,112
- 4-King-80, we need an RA. My location.
- [Windel groans]

15
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,450
Black, male, conscious
and, uh... [panting] ...breathing.

16
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:17,620
[operator on radio] <i>Copy, 4-King.
RA to your location.</i>

17
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:21,414
Jesus, Ballard.

18
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:22,624
[panting]

19
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:27,587
I thought... [grunts] ...cold cases
were gonna be safer.

20
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:28,672
[panting]

21
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:33,636
Yeah, well, I think that may have been
some wishful thinking.

22
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:52,987
Honey, you didn't have to wait.

23
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:55,991
Oh, just got out of my interview
five minutes ago.

24
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:57,575
Plus, you're my ride.

25
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:59,494
Ah. [chuckles]

26
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:00,662
How'd it go?

27
00:02:00,663 --> 00:02:04,207
[clicks tongue] Prelim should
show my actions were within policy,

28
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:06,876
but I gotta sit for a psych eval
before I head in.

29
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:08,378
[sighs]

30
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:10,922
It's worth it,
knowing we got Windel dead to rights.

31
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:12,340
Agreed.

32
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:14,802
Just, uh, watch your back.

33
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,262
[inhales sharply]
The two guys who grilled me

34
00:02:17,263 --> 00:02:21,934
asked a lot of questions about you
in a digging-for-dirt kinda way.

35
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:24,978
Good to know.

36
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:26,313
Breakfast of champions?

37
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:30,733
Maybe not, but we took on a whole lot
of bad business last night.

38
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,111
A little good won't kill me.

39
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,115
["Weary" playing]

40
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:18,532
[sighs]

41
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,543
You know, most cops would take
the day off after the night you had.

42
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:33,213
[scoffs] You're still getting to know me.

43
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:49,188
[song continues]

44
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:01,824
Oh.

45
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:04,327
- You gave us a scare.
- Oh.

46
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:07,288
Colleen's been mainlining local news
since she got in this morning.

47
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:08,457
I'm a worrywart.

48
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,960
Well, at least Windel is off the street.

49
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:12,794
Yeah.

50
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:15,589
I mean, I wish it didn't take ten years,
but yeah.

51
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:24,473
[sighs]

52
00:04:31,397 --> 00:04:32,773
Our first closed case.

53
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:36,776
[stammers] I was gonna make a cake, but
I didn't know if anyone was gluten-free.

54
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,736
Gluten-free is not a real thing, Colleen.

55
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:39,904
Uh, I'm pretty sure it is.

56
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:41,572
And you know the case
isn't actually closed, right?

57
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:43,324
It's just up to the courts now.

58
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:44,535
Well, someone's cranky.

59
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:46,495
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

60
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:53,544
Here.

61
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,296
Detective, the honors.

62
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,340
I-I cleared the shelves.

63
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,389
Figured we should have a special place.

64
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:12,730
[Ballard grunts]

65
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:15,399
[sighs]

66
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:21,612
Martina, where are the boxes
I brought from Property yesterday?

67
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:24,491
- [stammers] They were there. I didn't--
- Just taking a peek.

68
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:26,452
Not much to see really.

69
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:31,831
Question. Out of all the cases,
the thousands of cases to choose from,

70
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:32,999
why this one?

71
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,709
You're welcome to find one
to work on your own.

72
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:38,004
I'm just saying, it's got none of
the things that make it simple to close.

73
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,089
No DNA, no prints, no ID.

74
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,467
Just a body in the mountains
with a bullet in the head.

75
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:44,594
Cases like that tend
to fall through the cracks.

76
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:47,473
That's why you gotta open 'em up
and give them a fair shake.

77
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,099
Even if there's nothing simple about 'em.

78
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,768
I'm just asking the hard questions.

79
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:54,812
It seems like our, uh, resources
would be better served

80
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:58,067
by solving crimes against
the actual citizens of LA. Hmm?

81
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,903
This is weird.

82
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:06,617
What's that?

83
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:09,036
The other reason I want this case.

84
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,794
This is from a bus station in San Diego.

85
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:21,006
One of the last places
John Doe was seen alive.

86
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:23,300
That's him.

87
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,220
[gasps]

88
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:28,722
That baby was never found.

89
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:32,058
[Colleen] And what did
the investigating officer say?

90
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:33,643
[Ballard] IO is ducking my calls,

91
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:38,106
and I'm anxious to get some context
because the book just seems off.

92
00:06:38,107 --> 00:06:39,774
- Like something's missing.
- [Colleen] Hmm.

93
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:41,234
[Pearlman] This way.

94
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:42,819
Councilman Pearlman.

95
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,446
A word in your office, Detective.

96
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:54,789
You've been at it two weeks,
and already I'm getting heat.

97
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,915
This is about last night.

98
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,834
This is about
the officer-involved shooting

99
00:06:57,835 --> 00:06:59,043
that's all over the news.

100
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:01,129
Well, I certainly wasn't looking
to get shot at,

101
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,839
but aren't we missing the headline here?

102
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,757
We got a murderer off the street.

103
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:09,095
The point is, we'd like you to make
headlines that are less controversial.

104
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:11,430
To that end,
the primary focus of this unit

105
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,474
remains the murder of Councilman's sister.

106
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:15,476
- Which we are working.
- [stammers] Really?

107
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:17,520
Because it looks like
a study hall out there.

108
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:18,646
Pick up the pace.

109
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:22,317
I am trying, but big surprise,
people don't really like working for free.

110
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:27,905
All these applicants,
they're weirdos and wannabe podcasters.

111
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:30,199
With more money,
I could bring in a second sworn officer.

112
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,409
There is no more money.

113
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,995
Well then, I'm stretched thin.

114
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,789
The rest are reserves and volunteers.
I can only ask so much.

115
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,125
- You question Brian Richmond yet?
- Not yet.

116
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:41,586
I want something more actionable
before I do.

117
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:45,131
He was the number one suspect in '01.
Ex-boyfriend with a broken heart.

118
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:46,716
He killed her.

119
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:48,677
Sounds pretty actionable to me.

120
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,347
Look, I don't wanna burn him
until we know for sure.

121
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:55,516
I've asked Latent Prints
for everything we have.

122
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:57,518
I am reinterviewing every witness.

123
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,062
- We just need more time.
- [Pearlman] More time.

124
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:05,360
Man, do you know
how infuriating it is to hear that?

125
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:09,865
We have to go.

126
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,204
[sighs]

127
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:18,957
I heard from friends on the force
you weren't much of a team player.

128
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:23,712
I'm hoping you see this as an opportunity
to prove them wrong.

129
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:38,727
Just so we're absolutely clear,
this is your last stop.

130
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:42,773
If you don't close Sarah's case,
all of this goes away.

131
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:45,150
And you're done.

132
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:06,296
You good?

133
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:10,175
Yeah.

134
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:15,930
Keep up the good work.

135
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:17,599
Stop by any time.

136
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:19,935
I'll walk you guys out.

137
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,405
He kinda seems like a jerk.

138
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:33,573
I bet he's an Aries.

139
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:35,992
And Rawls is friends with him?

140
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:37,493
Yeah. They go way back.

141
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,287
- High school, I think.
- Mmm.

142
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:40,913
Pearlman put him here
to keep an eye on me.

143
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:43,417
[sighs] I knew it. Classic Aries.

144
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:47,462
Let me show you something.

145
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:54,636
Jake made me copies of their home videos.

146
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:56,805
Oh, gosh.

147
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:02,394
This one was the last one taken of Sarah.

148
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,896
Two weeks before she died.

149
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:12,486
[Pearlman] <i>I can't believe
the DMV actually gave you a license.</i>

150
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:14,739
<i>I'm serious.
You're like a public safety hazard.</i>

151
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,824
<i>Says the guy with three speeding tickets.</i>

152
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:18,409
[Pearlman] <i>I got you something.</i>

153
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,579
<i>Figured you could keep it
in your glove box until you get accepted.</i>

154
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,664
<i>Aw.</i>

155
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,708
<i>You just don't want me
to follow you to Fullerton.</i>

156
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:27,877
[Pearlman] <i>Come on. You can't have
a Fullerton diploma</i>

157
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:30,005
<i>hanging on your wall
when you're big in politics.</i>

158
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:31,881
<i>Listen,</i>

159
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:35,176
<i>I do have one piece of real advice.</i>

160
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:36,511
<i>Don't ever forget.</i>

161
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,764
<i>The brake is the one on the left.</i>

162
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,099
[scoffs] <i>You suck.</i>

163
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:44,144
[Pearlman] <i>Watch out, Los Angeles.</i>

164
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,109
Oh, it reminds me of my kids.

165
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,652
So sad.

166
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,865
Jake's the one who found her.
You've seen the crime scene photos.

167
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:00,243
That's how he remembers her,
not like this.

168
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:03,288
This is the reason why he pushes so hard.

169
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:06,124
He needs answers.

170
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:10,586
Hey, did you, um, hear back
from that IO on the John Doe case?

171
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:11,671
Nothing yet.

172
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:14,716
[sighs] I'm tired of waiting for her
to get back to me.

173
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:16,635
I'll call you later.

174
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:27,103
[dance music playing]

175
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:29,105
- [Ballard] Excuse me.
- [patrons chattering]

176
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:30,732
Zamira Parker working tonight?

177
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:35,195
Thank you.

178
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:40,533
Zamira Parker? Detective Renée Ballard.

179
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:43,869
I've been trying to
track you down all day.

180
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,705
I have some questions for you about
a John Doe case you worked in 2020.

181
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,042
Sorry. Not interested.

182
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:52,921
Yeah. I kinda got that message
when you didn't return my calls.

183
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:54,922
Care to tell me why?

184
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:57,676
'Cause LAPD's in my rearview,
and I'm not looking back.

185
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:01,303
- Besides, that case wasn't going nowhere.
- Is that why your book is so thin?

186
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:03,639
Bitch, I did my job.

187
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,016
There was a baby.

188
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:07,853
A critical missing you left out there.

189
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:11,939
I tried, but no one saw it as a priority.

190
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,067
I do. I'm reopening it.

191
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:15,861
You want a cookie?

192
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:22,701
In your chrono,
you listed four trips to that motel.

193
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:26,413
You left something out.

194
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:29,207
What makes you say that?

195
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,793
What was it? Did something happen?

196
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:40,552
You wanna know what I left out?

197
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,889
Somebody at the LAPD
was covering something up.

198
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:48,642
Things didn't square up.

199
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:52,146
We found a John Doe in the foothills,
and I tracked him back to this flophouse.

200
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:53,856
- This random--
- The Sunbeam.

201
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:55,065
That's the one.

202
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:58,402
I start talking to this guy. This burnout.

203
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:01,197
He don't know anything about
the John Doe or the baby,

204
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:04,575
but he tells me about an altercation
that happens the night before.

205
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:06,702
You didn't put anything
about this in your murder book.

206
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,955
He said people were yelling
in the parking lot.

207
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:10,539
He goes out there,

208
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,833
and he sees the motel manager
getting into it with some woman.

209
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:15,211
Black-and-white shows up.
Hauls the lady off.

210
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:17,046
Not unusual in a place like that.

211
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:19,256
- When I started--
- Hey, Z. It's crowded out here.

212
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:20,466
We gotta open up.

213
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:21,593
I need five minutes.

214
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:26,723
When I start asking the manager
about the altercation,

215
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:28,682
he gets real uncooperative.

216
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:30,100
So I head back to the barn,

217
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:33,730
and I start looking up all the 911 calls,
any record of a roll-out.

218
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:35,272
Nothing.

219
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:36,815
Nothing in the sergeant's log?

220
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,317
That's what I'm saying.

221
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:41,320
Someone buried that 911 call
and the roll-out.

222
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,988
Now, who would wanna do that?

223
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,990
That's why it's not in the book.

224
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:48,244
If you suspect that the cops
were involved, why not try to prove it?

225
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:49,328
Uh-huh.

226
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:52,415
'Cause calling the LAPD out on their shit
always goes so well.

227
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,251
Besides, I wasn't there much longer
after that.

228
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:57,837
I quit, like a week or two later.

229
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,424
Only thing I regret
is leaving them cases behind.

230
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:03,802
You want another shot at it?

231
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:05,762
The John Doe case.

232
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:10,641
Assuming you can keep your suspicions
about the department on the down-low.

233
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:12,476
There's a reason
I'm not a cop anymore, Detective.

234
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,521
I'm not asking you
to put the uniform back on.

235
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:17,148
All right, just look at the evidence.

236
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:19,568
We could really use your take.

237
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:21,069
[clicks tongue]

238
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,071
I don't know.

239
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:25,699
Okay.

240
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,915
You know, that baby
would probably be six years old.

241
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:40,088
Think about it.

242
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,302
[partner] <i>Thinking about bringing her on?</i>

243
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:47,219
It crossed my mind.

244
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,139
I'd have to reel her in slow.

245
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:52,016
Oh, we're getting a fridge tomorrow.

246
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:56,979
So this Parker give you any idea why
she flamed out of RHD after six months?

247
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,897
She did not. [clears throat]

248
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,775
Probably drugs, right? Booze?

249
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:02,860
Let's just wait and see.

250
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:04,529
She might not even show up.

251
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,950
Detective, that jewelry store homicide,
I think I have a new approach.

252
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:13,996
It's 80 degrees in here. [sighs]
I swear to God, this thing is useless.

253
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:16,749
[Colleen] I'm setting up eBay alerts
for the items that were stolen.

254
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,126
Over 300 pieces, so it'll take a while,

255
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:21,545
but if anything matches up,
I'll get notified.

256
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:23,756
Didn't that go down in, like, '09?

257
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:24,840
[Colleen] '07. Why?

258
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:27,301
And you think the killer's just now
trying to unload those goods?

259
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:28,637
Well, no.

260
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,597
But it could give us something
to trace back.

261
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,307
I have a really good feeling about this.

262
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:35,726
Whoa. It's like a library in here.

263
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:36,935
Parker.

264
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,729
Glad you could make it in.

265
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,358
I call it the Library of Lost Souls.

266
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:43,734
Zamira Parker, meet Colleen Hatteras.

267
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,194
- She's one of my volunteers.
- Hi.

268
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:48,405
I met her last year when she came to RHD
with a theory on a case.

269
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:49,490
Nobody wanted to listen to her

270
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:51,200
because she doesn't have
a law enforcement background.

271
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:53,869
Former soccer mom.
Current empty nester. [chuckles]

272
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,789
[Ballard] But her theory got us our guy.

273
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:58,499
And this is Thomas Laffont.

274
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,959
My first partner after I made detective.

275
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,088
He retired a few years ago,
but I pulled him back in as a reserve.

276
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:05,339
[Parker] I remember your name.

277
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,091
I was only in RHD for a few months,

278
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:09,510
but the guys would not stop talking
about your interviews.

279
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:10,595
Just a few months, huh?

280
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:12,638
Ted Rawls.

281
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:13,807
Pleasure.

282
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,432
Ted's a local business owner.

283
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:19,019
Private security,
but I've been a reserve for 12 years.

284
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:22,981
Councilman Pearlman thought
Ballard could use a little help down here.

285
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,734
[chuckles] Okay.
You going in the field today?

286
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,236
I wasn't planning to. Why?

287
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:29,321
A lot of hardware for a guy riding a desk.

288
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,032
It's like you're about to go to battle.

289
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:37,913
Parker was the IO on the John Doe case
we just pulled.

290
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:39,707
Thought I could use her input.

291
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:42,711
I'm just looking at evidence.
I'm not here to knock on any doors.

292
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:46,714
Copy that. Well, everything we have
is here and on the board.

293
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:49,258
[Parker] You know,
I called this the Santa Muerte case

294
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:51,802
after that figurine we found
in his bedroom at The Sunbeam?

295
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:53,762
I wondered what that was.

296
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:56,014
[Parker] Santa Muerte is a folk saint
out of Mexico.

297
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:59,644
A lot of immigrants carry them.
They think they offer protection.

298
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,603
Didn't much help here.

299
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:04,022
[Ballard] Is that how you figured
our John Doe was undocumented?

300
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,693
Yeah, I mean,
there wasn't a ton of detail.

301
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,027
And the department
was focused on other cases.

302
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,698
Makes sense. The killer's probably
already back across the border.

303
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,703
Martina Castro, meet Zamira Parker.

304
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:20,873
Martina is our intern
with an eye towards law school.

305
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:23,292
She's trying to get this place organized.

306
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:24,793
Is that from Latent Prints?

307
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,920
All they've got
on the Sarah Pearlman crime scene.

308
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:28,422
Thank you.

309
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:29,590
Now, this one I've heard of.

310
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:31,592
Yeah, Councilman Pearlman's sister

311
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:34,512
is why this unit's up and running
in the first place.

312
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,977
This is footage from the scene.

313
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:48,610
[Parker] It's like a time capsule.

314
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:51,029
They're all like that.

315
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:53,363
We get to go back and forth,

316
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:57,160
but the families, somehow,
they're always stuck back there.

317
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,621
[Parker sighs]

318
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:07,879
Sixteen. Strangled the night
before her Sadie Hawkins dance.

319
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:11,757
Oh, what? Is that--

320
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:12,841
Her retainer, yeah.

321
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,552
She lost it during the struggle.

322
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:17,638
You got the palm print.

323
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:19,181
What palm print?

324
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:21,433
It's from the window
that the killer climbed out of.

325
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:22,601
I've been trying to track it down

326
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:23,727
- for a week.
- Oh.

327
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:25,771
- It's a miracle it still exists.
- Yeah.

328
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:28,691
Looks like it was a waste of time.
It's too smeared to be usable.

329
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:30,651
I'm not thinking about the print.

330
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:33,029
Uh, I'm thinking about
the tape used to lift it.

331
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:37,242
There's a chance that it grabbed some DNA
the killer left behind.

332
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:41,454
- That's smart.
- That's what I said.

333
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:44,874
Touch DNA has come a long way
since the early aughts.

334
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:47,794
2001, you said?

335
00:18:48,503 --> 00:18:49,878
[Ballard] Yeah.

336
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:52,256
[sighs] The dusting powder tends
to absorb oil,

337
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:56,218
and 24 years later,
sample's gonna be pretty degraded.

338
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:57,427
But you'll take a look at it?

339
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:59,430
Sure, just don't get your hopes up.

340
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:02,641
What kind of timeline you thinking?

341
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,893
Thirty days, minimum. Get used to 60.

342
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:05,979
Sixty?

343
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,857
This is for the Pearlman case.
You know, the councilman.

344
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:11,692
You run the cold case unit?

345
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:13,069
Yeah.

346
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:16,030
I'll move it to the front of the line.

347
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:20,284
[Ballard] I'm sure the councilman
will really appreciate it.

348
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:22,161
I'm not doing it for the councilman.

349
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,539
You're Detective Ballard, right?

350
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:28,041
I heard about what you did last year.

351
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:29,127
Thought it was brave.

352
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:20,929
[music playing in distance]

353
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,602
Hey, baby girl.

354
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:30,103
How you doing?

355
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:31,356
[kisses]

356
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:33,524
Come on.

357
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,200
Lola, come on.

358
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:45,869
Jesus, Tutu.
You're gonna bust an eardrum in here.

359
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:50,708
The Menace had his workers there again.
Nothing but hammers and handsaws all day.

360
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:52,418
Driving me nuts.

361
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,420
Uh, grab me a Phillips-head.

362
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:56,088
Where is it?

363
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:58,715
I don't know. Look around.
Check the drawers.

364
00:20:58,716 --> 00:20:59,884
It's got a blue handle.

365
00:21:03,805 --> 00:21:05,681
You know, we could just buy a new vacuum.

366
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:09,142
[groans] Why are you laying
a beating on my kitchen?

367
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:10,812
[grunting] Yeah.

368
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:14,272
[sighs] What's wrong with you?

369
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,483
Nothing.

370
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:21,155
Oh, right. Perfect place for that.

371
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:24,533
You need to call
that lifeguard friend of yours.

372
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:25,952
What's his name? Aaron?

373
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:28,704
You're always more relaxed
after a night at his place.

374
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:29,789
Tutu.

375
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,540
What?

376
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,500
A roll in the hay always did it for me.

377
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:35,378
Ugh. Still does.

378
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:37,546
You know what, let's not, okay?

379
00:21:37,547 --> 00:21:38,755
Thanks. [sighs]

380
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:41,633
Maybe you ought to let him
take you to dinner for once.

381
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:42,885
Get to know him a little.

382
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:45,762
Lord knows
the only people you ever get close to

383
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:48,141
are those poor dead souls
in the cases you work.

384
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:51,018
Oh, well, that explains
why I'm so close to you.

385
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:53,395
You're halfway
in the grave already, Grandma.

386
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:54,647
Ha!

387
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:00,486
[Ballard chuckles]

388
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:08,660
You know that "nothing"
that was bothering you?

389
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:10,830
It have anything to do
with that business last year?

390
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:13,624
A woman at the lab brought it up.

391
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:18,045
Do I need to have words
with this lab lady?

392
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:19,881
[chuckles] No.

393
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:21,382
She meant well.

394
00:22:24,135 --> 00:22:25,844
It's just that any time someone
mentions it,

395
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,430
I feel like I'm right back there.

396
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:30,850
[breathes deeply, clears throat]

397
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,770
Like, I can't get free from it.

398
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:45,281
[sighs]

399
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,374
["Vibrations" playing]

400
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:15,186
- [sighs]
- [music stops]

401
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,065
Thank you.

402
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:29,033
- Can I help you?
- Spencer, right?

403
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:30,826
Remember me?

404
00:23:30,827 --> 00:23:32,828
I worked a murder back in 2020.

405
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:34,622
Mexican guy. Had a baby.

406
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:38,709
Traced his last known whereabouts
back to this charming place.

407
00:23:40,962 --> 00:23:42,046
Zamira Parker.

408
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:44,465
Robbery Homicide?

409
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:46,300
Ringing any bells?

410
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:52,014
Yeah, I can see
how we all might blend together.

411
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:55,393
Record like yours,
you've probably seen a lot of cops.

412
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:57,227
Grand theft, assault...

413
00:23:57,228 --> 00:23:58,311
What do you want?

414
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:01,022
I'm curious to see if anybody
came around looking for him.

415
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:05,069
You're asking about someone who died,
what, five years ago?

416
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:09,448
No wonder you people
got such a stellar rep.

417
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:12,409
I got nothing.

418
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:14,619
Now, could you vacate?

419
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,122
Cops ain't good for business.

00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:30,553
Olivas, I think this one's for you.

- Zamira Parker?

00:24:42,315 --> 00:24:44,858
I'm sorry. She doesn't work here anymore.

Hello?

431
00:24:52,033 --> 00:24:55,410
So you get the same stuff you did
when you were actually on the job?

432
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:56,494
Yeah, pretty much.

433
00:24:56,495 --> 00:25:01,417
Get to carry a gun, badge,
check out equipment, drive a city ride.

434
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:05,046
Sorry those perks
don't apply to the interns.

435
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:07,881
Oh, I'm mostly here
for the college credit. [chuckles]

436
00:25:07,882 --> 00:25:10,718
Uh-huh. What kind of law
are you interested in?

437
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:13,429
Maybe corporate law or finance.

438
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:15,972
And you chose this internship?

439
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:17,724
Well, I figured at one of those big firms

440
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:20,728
I probably would've just spent
the whole semester restocking coffee pods.

- Mmm.
- [Ballard] Morning.

442
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,981
Any news from the lab?

443
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:26,651
She told you it would be a long shot.

444
00:25:27,235 --> 00:25:28,944
Hmm. We got a fridge.

445
00:25:28,945 --> 00:25:30,029
Yeah.

446
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:33,241
Starting to feel
like a real unit around here.

447
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,744
Colleen, that's evidence.
It doesn't belong on your desk.

448
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:39,537
I'm sorry, it's just...

449
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:42,250
[stammers] I get some weird energy
off of it.

450
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:45,293
Weird energy? What does that mean?

451
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:48,296
You know, uh, like...
like a sense of things.

452
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:50,925
Thought it'd be good to keep it close by
while I work the case.

453
00:25:56,514 --> 00:25:58,099
Can I see you in my office, please?

454
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:03,479
Close the door.

455
00:26:06,691 --> 00:26:09,276
Please don't tell me
you think you're psychic. [sighs]

456
00:26:09,277 --> 00:26:15,031
[stammers] I have intuitions. I... I know
things about people. Like an empath.

457
00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:16,199
[sighs] Oh, my God.

458
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,118
Is that a problem?
I thought it could be useful if I--

459
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:20,453
Imagine this jewelry store case
goes to trial.

460
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:24,041
If a defense attorney got wind of this,
they would eviscerate you on the stand.

461
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:26,584
[sighs]

462
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,086
You do good work, Colleen.

463
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:30,256
I just don't want it undermined
by anything.

464
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:35,719
[stammers] I understand.
I'll just... I'll keep this to myself.

465
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,430
- Thank you. Yep.
- And I'll put the...

466
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:41,017
[Ballard sighs]

467
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:45,353
- Parker, good morning.
- Yeah, hey.

468
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,981
I'm about to head to that motel.
The Sunbeam.

469
00:26:47,982 --> 00:26:49,066
Anything I should know?

470
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:52,736
Um, actually, I just stopped by there.

471
00:26:52,737 --> 00:26:53,821
Oh, really?

472
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,615
And here I thought
we weren't knocking on doors.

473
00:26:57,658 --> 00:26:59,160
Yeah, uh, listen.

474
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:04,457
Going back to that place,
it just reminded me, um...

475
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:09,211
This thing dried up, like, five years ago.

476
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:12,173
What do you think
we're gonna get from it now?

477
00:27:13,174 --> 00:27:14,341
Well, I don't know.

478
00:27:14,342 --> 00:27:16,052
Past is always present.

479
00:27:16,886 --> 00:27:20,306
But if no one cares enough to dig,
then it just stays buried.

480
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:23,184
I don't think this is me anymore.

481
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:25,603
You know, maybe it never was.

482
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:28,563
What if you're wrong?

483
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:30,024
You did go to that motel.

484
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:32,610
So you do care.

485
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:36,405
Look, just give me a day of your time.

486
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:38,532
Maybe two.

487
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:44,622
[sighs] One day.

Hey, Darcy.

491
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:00,221
Long shot paid off.

492
00:28:00,805 --> 00:28:03,223
- The lab got DNA off that print tape.
- You're kidding.

493
00:28:03,224 --> 00:28:05,350
The killer's DNA's been there
this whole time.

494
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:06,684
[sighs] I know.

495
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:09,062
Now we need to find a profile
to compare it to.

496
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:11,648
- You still got a line on the ex-boyfriend?
- Brian Richmond?

497
00:28:11,649 --> 00:28:13,733
Pearlman sure thinks he's our guy.

498
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:15,902
[Laffont] Good luck
getting a warrant for his DNA.

499
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:17,946
Even back then,
they didn't have enough probable cause.

500
00:28:17,947 --> 00:28:19,907
Oh, I'll get it some other way.

501
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:25,371

[groans]

504
00:28:32,962 --> 00:28:35,172
Nelson. I was just about to call.

505
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:40,511
I heard you're running some DNA tests.
Something about a palm print.

506
00:28:41,095 --> 00:28:43,346
Yeah, we found a palm print
in the case file.

507
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:44,889
[Nelson] <i>Does it match Richmond?</i>

508
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:47,143
Well, it's impossible to say right now.

509
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:51,104
[Nelson] <i>Look, I don't want to hear
about this through the grapevine.</i>

510
00:28:51,105 --> 00:28:52,565
<i>I want to hear it from you.</i>

511
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:56,860
Yeah, understood. We should have
something meaningful any minute now.

512
00:28:56,861 --> 00:28:58,027
You'll be the first to know.

513
00:28:58,028 --> 00:28:59,447
Fantastic.

514
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:05,786

Don will be with you in a minute.
Take a look around.

518
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,720
Thanks.

519
00:29:28,476 --> 00:29:31,896
Is this your stuff?
Brian, is that your name?

520
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:34,565
Yeah.

521
00:29:35,483 --> 00:29:37,526
Do you mind giving me a quote on a piece?

522
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:40,403
Kind of on a roll here.

523
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:43,281
Uh, but Don can help you out.
He knows my price.

524
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:44,575
Give me a minute.

525
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:10,141
House of Ink.

526
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:11,560
Yo, Brian, it's for you.

527
00:30:13,604 --> 00:30:14,772
[Brian sighs]

528
00:30:16,524 --> 00:30:17,525
Sorry.

529
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:25,157
It's Brian.

530
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:28,661
Uh, yeah. Let me check.

531
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:31,997
I got time Thursday.

532
00:30:33,374 --> 00:30:35,668
Friday? Sorry, I heard you wrong.

533
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:40,213
Yeah, I'll do Friday. Yeah.

534
00:30:40,214 --> 00:30:42,967
Hey, I'm-I'm double parked.
I'm gonna check on my car.

535
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:51,016
I can spot you cops a mile away.

536
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:56,814
Police already ruined my life with this.

537
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,316
Leave me alone.

538
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:11,578
Hey. Looking for Cold Cases.

539
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:14,080
- [officer] Uh, someone call you a pass?
- Afraid not.

540
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:15,498
Figured I could just stop by.

541
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:17,542
Haven't been out here
since I was a recruit.

542
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:18,919
Sure don't miss that rope climb.

543
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,005
You're Olivas. RHD?

544
00:31:22,006 --> 00:31:24,591
You addressed my academy class
about proper evidence collection.

545
00:31:24,592 --> 00:31:25,717
[chuckles]

546
00:31:25,718 --> 00:31:27,303
Job can't always be sexy.

547
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:31,807
- [officer] Stairs on the left.
- Appreciate you.

548
00:31:40,316 --> 00:31:41,816
- [Olivas clears throat]
- Oh.

549
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:43,943
Hey, there. Uh, Zamira Parker around?

550
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:45,903
She just stepped out.
She should be right back.

551
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,614
Thomas Laffont.

552
00:31:47,615 --> 00:31:49,240
Robert.

553
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:50,992
You are Mr. RHD.

554
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:53,202
[stammers] And your name was?

555
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:55,705
Colleen Hatteras. I-I'm a volunteer.

556
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:58,541
Got a lot of admiration
for people like you.

557
00:31:58,542 --> 00:31:59,710
Oh.

558
00:32:00,294 --> 00:32:01,920
[stammers] There she is.

559
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:04,297
Parker and I were partners for a bit.

560
00:32:04,298 --> 00:32:06,884
You wouldn't believe
who they got me rolling with now.

561
00:32:07,468 --> 00:32:09,802
Pietras. Dude with the floss?

562
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:10,929
Olivas.

563
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:13,932
What are you doing here?

564
00:32:14,642 --> 00:32:18,269
A woman called down to RHD earlier,
asked for Parker.

565
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,898
When I told her she no longer
worked there, lady hung up on me.

566
00:32:21,732 --> 00:32:25,109
Call came from a motel tied to a case
that we worked on back in the day.

567
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:27,071
The Sunbeam. Remember that dump?

568
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,530
Anyway, I asked around,

569
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:31,741
heard that Parker was dipping her toe
down here with you.

570
00:32:31,742 --> 00:32:33,326
Case is cold, isn't it?

571
00:32:33,327 --> 00:32:34,619
Sadly, yeah.

572
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,121
But if it's something that
you might take a look at,

573
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:38,623
I am more than willing to help out.

574
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:40,376
You probably have enough on your plate.

575
00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:42,670
Fair point.

576
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,879
Anyway, glad I came down.

577
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,923
Wanted to see your whole operation.

578
00:32:46,924 --> 00:32:48,133
Well, now you've seen it.

579
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:49,760
Thanks for stopping by.

580
00:32:55,516 --> 00:32:57,559
It's good to see you folks. Laffont.

581
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,399
Feel free to just call next time.

582
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,151
[sighs] Ballard, come on.

583
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:09,070
Ain't it time we bury the hatchet?

584
00:33:09,071 --> 00:33:10,947
Oh, I plan on burying it.

585
00:33:10,948 --> 00:33:12,241
In your goddamn back.

586
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:20,040
Always a pleasure.

587
00:34:09,006 --> 00:34:10,381
[Aaron] You were looking pretty good
out there.

588
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:11,466
[Ballard chuckles]

589
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:14,261
- Passed up some nice sets though.
- Yeah.

590
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,930
I got some things on my mind.

591
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:22,477
Sometimes it's just nice to sit out there,
you know?

592
00:34:22,478 --> 00:34:24,855
I got coffee if you wanna talk?

593
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:26,648
I gotta go meet someone.

594
00:34:27,191 --> 00:34:28,191
Rain check?

595
00:34:28,192 --> 00:34:29,318
Anytime.

596
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,113
I'll call you.

597
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:35,407
I'll answer.

598
00:34:36,492 --> 00:34:37,910
Come on, baby girl.

599
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:40,120
Let's go.

600
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,473
[Ballard] Thanks for meeting me.

601
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,935
You know, I remember when you joined up.

602
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:07,147
It was encouraging to see another woman
climb the ranks like you did.

603
00:35:09,191 --> 00:35:10,609
Why you charming me?

604
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:17,198
I'm hoping that whatever made you leave,
you'll put it behind you,

605
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:19,618
'cause I think you'd be a great addition
to my team.

606
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:25,289
You know, me and my brothers,

607
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,292
we was always told
to watch out for the cops.

608
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:30,254
It was always us against them.

609
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:37,094
So when I went into the Academy,
everybody thought I was out of my mind.

610
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:40,389
Lost a lot of friends.

611
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,183
Mama started looking at me funny, it was...

612
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:47,646
But I thought I could make it better
for all of 'em.

613
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:50,649
[Ballard] Didn't work out that way.

614
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:53,110
[sighs] No, it did not.

615
00:35:53,861 --> 00:35:56,070
Then I meet you, and I think,
maybe, I don't know, like,

616
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:57,906
I could finally do some good.

617
00:35:59,283 --> 00:36:02,744
But getting involved with this case again,

618
00:36:03,412 --> 00:36:05,414
working with the LAPD again, it just...

619
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:09,585
it just reminded me
why I left it all behind.

620
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,796
Why did you leave?

621
00:36:15,299 --> 00:36:16,425
A lot of hypocrisy.

622
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:19,428
Lot of assholes.

623
00:36:22,264 --> 00:36:23,765
A lot of victims too.

624
00:36:25,267 --> 00:36:27,352
But, yeah,
the assholes are definitely a thing.

625
00:36:28,145 --> 00:36:30,689
How do you think I ended up
heading the Cold Case unit?

626
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,943
I tried to call one of those assholes out,

627
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:38,155
department sided with him
and then I got booted.

628
00:36:39,907 --> 00:36:42,450
What better way
to keep the troublesome woman quiet

629
00:36:42,451 --> 00:36:45,370
than to silo her
in the ass-end of the LAPD?

630
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:52,920
Bottom line is,
I think they wanted me to quit.

631
00:36:53,629 --> 00:36:55,088
But that's not happening.

632
00:36:58,634 --> 00:37:02,930
This asshole you keep talking about,
was it Olivas?

633
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:10,686
You know, I'll tell you something.

634
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:13,273
It's actually why
I pulled the John Doe case.

635
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:18,612
No better way to stick it to the guy
than to solve the case he couldn't, right?

636
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:23,784
Why don't you do it with me?

637
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:27,162
Officially join the unit.

638
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:31,708
I know you wanna go by that
motel after what Olivas said.

639
00:37:36,046 --> 00:37:38,798
Look, I have a stack of résumés
on my desk,

640
00:37:38,799 --> 00:37:41,551
a bunch of people who think
it'd be neat to solve a crime.

641
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:43,679
But they're tourists.

642
00:37:46,515 --> 00:37:47,557
I want you.

643
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:50,477
What do you say?

644
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:00,821
Okay.

645
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:03,740
Hell with it, I'm in.

646
00:38:29,683 --> 00:38:30,684
[radio chatter]

647
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:51,955
[in Spanish] Excuse me.

648
00:38:52,873 --> 00:38:53,874
What happened?

649
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:55,834
Yulia is dead.

650
00:38:56,001 --> 00:38:57,085
Someone killed her.

651
00:38:57,961 --> 00:38:59,004
Yulia?

652
00:39:00,881 --> 00:39:02,006
She works here?

653
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:05,052
[sobs] She's a cleaning woman like me.

654
00:39:05,594 --> 00:39:06,595
[speaks Spanish]

655
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:15,812
[in English] Oh, my God.

656
00:39:18,565 --> 00:39:19,691
[line ringing]

657
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:24,111
- [Ballard] <i>Detective Ballard.</i>
- Renée, it's Darcy.

658
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:27,073
<i>Even though you weren't able to get
any DNA off Brian Richmond,</i>

659
00:39:27,074 --> 00:39:29,950
I went ahead and ran that Touch DNA
from the palm print through CODIS.

660
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:31,410
And I got a case-to-case hit.

661
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:32,662
No shit.

662
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:38,000
Sarah Pearlman's killer left DNA behind
at another crime scene.

663
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:40,003
Yeah, it's another murder too.

664
00:39:41,922 --> 00:39:45,299
A woman named Laura Wilson. Back in '08.

665
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:48,053
We might have a goddamn serial killer
on our hands.

666
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:16,289
Wow.

667
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:19,334
You don't see many books this clean.

668
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:22,754
Who was the investigator?

669
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:30,345
[sighs] You gotta be kidding me.

670
00:40:34,224 --> 00:40:35,559
[sighs]

671
00:40:36,143 --> 00:40:37,686
Harry fucking Bosch.

672
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:51,283
Here we go.

673
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:56,788
I do wonder if running cold cases
is secondary trauma.

674
00:40:57,581 --> 00:40:59,582
<i>It's a position you were forced into</i>

675
00:40:59,583 --> 00:41:02,668
<i>because your brother's in blue
turned their backs on you.</i>

676
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:04,253
Why are we catching a fresh one?

677
00:41:04,254 --> 00:41:06,840
You missed the part where she said
Yulia might be tied to the John Doe?

678
00:41:07,424 --> 00:41:08,591
Where'd you get the gun?

679
00:41:08,592 --> 00:41:10,926
Street guys call him Montana.
He was definitely a cop.

680
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:13,889
Gonna be near impossible
investigating potential corruption.

681
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,140
[moans]

682
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:18,350
Everyone is mad at the LAPD...

683
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:19,977
- [groans, grunts]
- Stay down.

684
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:21,353
...And I'm the punching bag.

685
00:41:21,354 --> 00:41:23,856
<i>I would kill for the experience
you're getting in Cold Cases.</i>

686
00:41:23,857 --> 00:41:26,400
[Ballard] <i>The killer is out there
right now, and he could still be active.</i>

687
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:28,777
He's methodical.
He's not choosing these women randomly.

688
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:30,946
There's just something we're not seeing.

689
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:33,073
You assured me that my sister's case--

690
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:36,285
Your sister is not more or less important
than any of my victims.

691
00:41:36,286 --> 00:41:39,455
[captain] <i>Homicide has more
resources for something this size.</i>

692
00:41:39,456 --> 00:41:42,751
We have 14 victims now.

693
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:45,003

695
00:41:49,341 --> 00:41:51,425

- [grunts]
- [Ballard screaming]
