1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:01,668
[Ballard] <i>Previously on</i> Ballard<i>...</i>

2
00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:03,795
<i>I found a closed case from 2008.</i>

3
00:00:03,796 --> 00:00:06,548
The family reported
a gold bracelet missing from the scene.

4
00:00:06,549 --> 00:00:09,801
- That's Elena's. Where did you get this?
- [Ballard] <i>In a storage unit</i>

5
00:00:09,802 --> 00:00:12,011
<i>that belonged to the person
who actually killed your fiancée.</i>

6
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,305
We're juggling a police conspiracy
and a serial killer,

7
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:16,015
so it's not like we can put
either of them on hold.

8
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,517
Do we have an update
on Ibarra's girlfriend?

9
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:19,519
I got better than an update.
I got her name.

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,479
- Abril Cortez?
- Yes.

11
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,440
Does the cartel has my son?

12
00:00:23,441 --> 00:00:26,526
We are going to keep looking for him.

13
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:28,737
- Whoa, whoa. What's going on?
- Hey. What the hell?

14
00:00:28,738 --> 00:00:30,530
Homicide is taking the Pearlman case.

15
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,866
[dog barking]

16
00:00:32,867 --> 00:00:34,701
[grunting, groans]

17
00:00:34,702 --> 00:00:37,162
- Who's Anthony Driscoll?
- He murdered a John Doe,

18
00:00:37,163 --> 00:00:38,496
one of my cold cases.

19
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:40,457
And then I find out this guy's
running guns and drugs

20
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:42,333
between the cartel and the LAPD.

21
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:44,169
- Jesus, Ballard.
- Yeah.

22
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,379
And he must've been in deep
because he chose to pull his trache

23
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,464
rather than get arrested.

24
00:00:47,465 --> 00:00:48,632
- [gags, grunts]
- No!

25
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:50,717
[police radio chatter]

26
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:51,801
[Laffont] You okay?

27
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:53,052
Everything's gonna be fine.

28
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,972
I gotta figure out how to get
that phone back in the chain of custody.

29
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:57,349
[Bosch] <i>Already took care of it.</i>

30
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:00,226
<i>Working with Mo.</i>

31
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:02,271
We traced another number
from Driscoll's cell phone.

32
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:04,315
I wanted you to see it for yourself.

33
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:09,195
- Kids, where are you going?
- Hey, hey. Slowly. Slowly.

34
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:15,575
{\an8}- [radio chatter]
- [sirens wailing]

35
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,995
{\an8}[helicopter whirring]

36
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:34,470
[sighs] She okay, Cap?

37
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,180
She's been better.

38
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:40,226
What are you doing out here, Bobby?

39
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:44,647
Hey, it's not like you two
root each other on.

40
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:46,524
She's still one of ours.

41
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:51,153
Hey. RHD needs to get out
in front of this.

42
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:54,156
Got any leads
on that piece of shit in there?

43
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:58,910
He have a wallet on him? Cell phone?

44
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:00,454
No, but Ballard ID'd him.

45
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,164
Guy's an ex cop.

46
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,041
No way. Who?

47
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:07,711
Anthony Driscoll. Worked GND.

48
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:10,672
She was chasing him down
for one of her cold case murders.

49
00:02:10,673 --> 00:02:11,841
Jesus.

50
00:02:12,675 --> 00:02:13,676
Are you okay?

51
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:25,104
[Laffont] Let's go!

52
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:36,282
LAPD! Search warrant!

53
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,242
[Olivas] Crossing.

54
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:41,452
Clear!

55
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:42,579
[officer 1] Clear!

56
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,998
- [officer 2] Clear!
- Let's go, boys.

57
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:55,758
[clears throat]

58
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,051
Are those the boxes from Cold Cases?

59
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:59,763
I know Sheriff's are doing their thing
but I wanna put eyes on it too.

60
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:35,299
[sighs]

61
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,260
Driscoll tried to kill a cop.

62
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:41,763
What if he talked? He could have told her
about the whole operation.

63
00:03:41,764 --> 00:03:44,515
Look, if he talked, Ballard would have
kept him around to testify.

64
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:46,976
Oh, I am out.
This whole thing is sideways.

65
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:49,271
And what, Pincher?
You're gonna just walk away?

66
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:51,982
Anyone else want to commit suicide?

67
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:55,693
I saw her book, all right?

68
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:58,112
She's got Driscoll
tied to this five-year-old Ibarra murder

69
00:03:58,113 --> 00:03:59,822
and that's as far as she got.

70
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:02,034
She doesn't even know that we exist.

71
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:05,203
So keep doing your jobs
and the money will keep flowing.

72
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:07,539
I'll make sure the cartel
knows it's business as usual.

73
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:12,169
[clicks tongue] So, what, you...
You running this thing now?

74
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,630
Oh, you're welcome to the job
if you want it.

75
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:19,677
[Pincher] Yeah.

76
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,056
Go on then. I'll be in touch.

77
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:33,815
Hey, Driscoll had me working
this intern at the Ahmanson.

78
00:04:33,816 --> 00:04:36,652
Nice girl,
but Ballard kept her at arm's length.

79
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:38,987
I was thinking, if it's all the same,

80
00:04:38,988 --> 00:04:40,656
- we just let her go since--
- No.

81
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:43,784
Stay on her.
See if Ballard's gonna keep digging.

82
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:50,707
- [doorbell chimes]
- <i>Mijo,</i> hold the door for everyone please.

83
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:51,791
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

84
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,585
I know that was really hard for you.
[chuckles]

85
00:04:56,005 --> 00:04:58,214
- Mmm. [mutters]
- [chuckles] Wow.

86
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:00,550
Wow. [chuckles] That is a mess.

87
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:02,385
- [gasps] Oh, no. I made it worse. Sorry.
- Hey, hey, hey.

88
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:03,929
- Ooh. Sorry.
- [both chuckle]

89
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:05,972
[speaking indistinctly]

90
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:07,682
- Kids, where are you going?
- Oh. Hey, hey.

91
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:09,267
- Slow. Slow, slow.
- Oh, my God. [chuckles]

92
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:11,061
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

93
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,148
[breathes heavily]

94
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:29,163
I'm all about security, but, uh, it's a
little cramped in here, don't you think?

95
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:32,206
We're dealing with dirty cops
and drug cartels

96
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:35,084
so... no boards, no bullpen.

97
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:36,169
Tight ship.

98
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,297
Until we have concrete evidence
to bring to Berchem.

99
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:40,716
You actually saw Olivas?

100
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:42,593
No question.

101
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,803
Bosch's guy pulled 14 numbers
off of Driscoll's phone.

102
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:46,889
All burners.

103
00:05:47,473 --> 00:05:50,184
We traced one of them
directly to Olivas last night.

104
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,728
He's fourth on the list.
Number ends in 0666.

105
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:55,856
[scoffs] Little on the nose,
don't you think?

106
00:05:56,482 --> 00:05:58,566
[Ballard sighs] Three of those burners
are in Mexico.

107
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:01,277
One of 'em's in state prison.
That leaves nine here in LA.

108
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:02,653
They're still operational?

109
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,073
Yeah.

110
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:05,866
They don't know we're onto them.

111
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:09,119
Exactly.
Which is why we have to move fast.

112
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:11,704
So, names we know so far.

113
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:14,500
First on the list: Jesus Velasco.

114
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:17,377
Cartel shot-caller
that Abril told us about.

115
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,089
The other four are dirty cops.

116
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:25,552
Chuck Tolli. Damen Pincher. Cindi Bundshu.

117
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:27,554
And, of course, Olivas.

118
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:29,515
[Laffont clicks tongue]

119
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:32,142
Disgrace to the badge. All of 'em.

120
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:34,435
And there could be more.

121
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:36,230
Mo's still tracking down
the other numbers.

122
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:39,316
Could be LAPD,
Sheriff's Department, anyone.

123
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:42,360
Take a good look at these photos.

124
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:44,320
I'm pulling them for now. Tight ship.

125
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,532
I'll deep dive into the background
on the cops.

126
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,533
Gimme a hand?

127
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:49,742
I'm a background machine.

128
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,995
And I can build a phone tree with these.

129
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:53,830
See how these creeps communicate.

130
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:56,666
What about that black-and-white
we saw make that meet with Driscoll?

131
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:59,001
The-The Hollywood car in Inglewood.

132
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:01,129
If you can trace one of these names
back to that car...

133
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,964
I got a friend I could ask
in the Hollywood division.

134
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:04,383
And you trust him?

135
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:07,553
To buy a round, no. With my life, 100.

136
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:10,305
Take me with you.
Can't be stuck in here all day.

137
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,977
And, guys, one more thing.

138
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:18,480
They don't know we're onto them,
and it has to stay that way.

139
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:20,898
So, work other cases.

140
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,733
Make it look like business as usual.
All right?

141
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:25,279
In that case, we got a stop I gotta
make before we get to Hollywood.

142
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:28,198
[Ted] Great.

143
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:32,286
I know I should be happy.

144
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,247
The man who killed Luis is dead.

145
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:40,377
But he took my family from me.

146
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:42,671
And I'll never get that back.

147
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:46,049
Luis's case may be closed,

148
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,094
but that doesn't mean
we'll stop looking for your son.

149
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:53,599
[breathes shakily, sighs]

150
00:07:56,852 --> 00:07:58,270
The last time I saw him...

151
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:03,734
I was giving him bottles
and rocking him to sleep

152
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:06,653
and singing "<i>Arrorró Mi Niño</i>".

153
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,574
[inhales sharply] He's a boy now.

154
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,577
He wouldn't recognize me.

155
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:20,542
[inhales sharply]
What if I don't recognize him?

156
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:23,587
Don't worry about that right now.

157
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:27,299
[Laffont] Um...

158
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:34,056
If we find Gael, we'll need
a DNA sample to match to him.

159
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:36,183
Okay?

160
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:41,855
Little premature, isn't it?

161
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:45,149
Getting her DNA.
We've got no lead on that kid.

162
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,694
Actually, my Gael age progression
came through.

163
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:49,947
I'm narrowing down potential matches.

164
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:52,616
Well, all right then.

165
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:57,120
Here you go.

166
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:58,914
I need you on your A-game.

167
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:05,087
I thought you'd be thrilled.

168
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:06,880
We're going after him.

169
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,424
Yeah, but not for what he did to me.

170
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:11,801
What he did to us.

171
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:14,096
He will know that we're the ones
that brought this down on him.

172
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:18,725
Yeah.

173
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:21,937
[inhales deeply]
Maybe it's better this way.

174
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:28,235
Doesn't have to all come out.
People don't have to... know why I left.

175
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,861
What made me come back.

176
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:33,615
You don't owe anyone in this department
an explanation.

177
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:37,577
[sighs] I'm not talking about
the department.

178
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:41,123
Your mom.

179
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,628
You know,
I'm still learning this myself, but...

180
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,674
sometimes when you show people
the hurt side of you,

181
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:53,010
it lessens the sting a little.

182
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:01,434
[Laffont] <i>I know you're busy.</i>

183
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:05,022
Look, send me everything you have
on the kids, and I'll do the work myself.

184
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:07,399
Thanks.

185
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,401
[sighs]

186
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:12,945
Hey, if you've got all these pictures
of potential Gaels,

187
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,280
why not just show them to Abril?

188
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:17,284
I'd rather not upset her
over what could be a dead end.

189
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:21,288
Besides, she's not wrong,
she may not recognize him.

190
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:23,873
Okay, well, we get the addresses,

191
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:25,708
we collect the DNA,
we-we find the one that matches.

192
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:28,085
We can't go around
testing kids willy-nilly.

193
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:29,587
We need to narrow the field.

194
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:31,130
But that's what's in the record.

195
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,757
Where they were surrendered.

196
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:35,177
Maybe the name of the person
who surrendered them, if we're lucky.

197
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:37,054
Baby in a haystack.

198
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:39,431
You gotta work on your metaphors.

199
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:46,688
Hey.

200
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:48,856
- Any luck?
- [sighs]

201
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:51,234
If this was for anybody else,
I would not be doing it.

202
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:55,364
I checked the sign out for the
black-and-whites on the day you flagged.

203
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,741
All the cops were on duty except for one.

204
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,452
A Blue Suit. Chuck Tolli.

205
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:03,662
He checked out a Shamu to go to court.

206
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,122
Tolli. You're sure?

207
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,540
Yeah, no question.

208
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,625
It's weird, huh?

209
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:10,379
I mean, most cops drive their own cars
so that they can go home after.

210
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:12,297
Thanks, Duff.

211
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:15,257
And remember, we never asked about this.

212
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:16,635
Asked about what?

213
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:22,640
[line ringing]

214
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:24,684
[sighs, clicks tongue]

215
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:36,320
[Lidell] <i>Hi, you've reached
Detective Lidell.</i>

216
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:37,405
[tone beeps]

217
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:39,907
Hey, this is Detective Ballard,
Cold Cases.

218
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:41,492
Uh, I left word yesterday.

219
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,744
I have some new information
on the Pearlman case,

220
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:46,123
I heard you were running it,
so give me a ring.

221
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,125
[coughs]

222
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:50,669
[footsteps approaching]

223
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:58,718
Tolli was the one who met with Driscoll
in the black-and-white that night.

224
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:01,137
[Colleen] That tracks.

225
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:03,848
Driscoll called his burner
maybe an hour before that meet up.

226
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:06,226
[blows]
Not looking good for Officer Tolli.

227
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,478
What other fruit you got in the tree?

228
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:13,774
Well, Driscoll mostly dialed up the chain
to Jesus and the phones in Mexico,

229
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,777
but look at these.

230
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:18,321
All to a number ending in 1922.

231
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:19,947
A lot of 'em.

232
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:22,075
Bosch's guy's on it.
Hopefully he gets a name.

233
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:23,827
Anything else on the other cops?

234
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:25,662
Damen Pincher.

235
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:28,456
Driscoll's old partner
from Gangs and Narcotics.

236
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:31,375
Undercover long enough
to lose his way I guess. [inhales deeply]

237
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,210
Driscoll must have roped him in early on.

238
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:34,462
And the woman?

239
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:37,715
Cindi Bundshu
failed her sergeant's exam twice.

240
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:39,508
And is deep in debt.

241
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:40,593
Like, 200K.

242
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:41,844
Oof.

243
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:44,013
Pretty easy to guess
how she ended up over a barrel.

244
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:45,181
<i>sighs</i>

245
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:47,892
Olivas is coming up clean, of course.

246
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:50,312
Of course, but we'll find something.

247
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:53,273
All right, let's call it.
Take everything off the board.

248
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,318
This was really good work for one day,
you guys.

249
00:12:57,152 --> 00:12:58,653
If I were them, I'd be running scared.

250
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:04,241
[hip-hop music playing]

251
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:05,534
You know how it works.

252
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:10,039
A good school gives you a leg-up,
and I'm no legacy.

253
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,333
You don't need any of that.

254
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:13,876
You're gonna get in
to everywhere you apply.

255
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:15,170
You are delusional.

256
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,172
But sweet.

257
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:22,344
So, what's up with work?

258
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:25,055
You said they took
that big serial case away?

259
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,389
We still got plenty to do.

260
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,475
Yeah, like what?

261
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,976
There's 6,000 cold cases in the LAPD.

262
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,312
[chuckles] Right.

263
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:36,482
What about that craziness with your boss?

264
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,026
And that guy who attacked her.

265
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:41,278
I told you, it's fine.

266
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,657
Marty, you're not trained
to protect yourself.

267
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:46,159
And if she's not safe, then...

268
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:54,625
My boyfriend's a cop.
I have nothing to worry about.

269
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:55,793
Mm-hmm.

270
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:58,088
Hurry up. It's <i>Love is Blind</i> time.

271
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:02,884
And don't think for a second
I won't watch without you.

272
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:04,885
It'd be faster if you helped.

273
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:05,970
No, thanks.

274
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:07,847
[water running]

275
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:11,350
[phone buzzing]

276
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,436
[hip-hop music ends]

277
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:50,599
Hey.

278
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:53,518
Are you okay?

279
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:57,647
[clicks tongue]
Actually, I'm not feeling great.

280
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:01,443
Um, yeah, I think maybe I should go home.

281
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:03,902
How much did you drink?

282
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:07,741
No, it's not that. It's just my stomach.

283
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:14,205
I think it's just, uh...
you know, lady stuff.

284
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:20,253
How about I drive you home?

285
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:24,883
No, I'm good.

286
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,011
And I won't watch without you.

287
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,347
Promise.

288
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:35,935
I'll text you when I'm home.

289
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:41,399
[knocks on door]

290
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,862
Hey, what are you doing here?

291
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:48,657
Uh, it's him.

292
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:51,326
What are you talking about? Who?

293
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:54,204
- Can I come in?
- Of course.

294
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:57,874
I took a picture.

295
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:03,462
What is this?

296
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:06,507
He was getting texts. From Olivas.

297
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:07,591
0666.

298
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:08,967
Martina, who was getting texts?

299
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,512
Manny Santos. My boyfriend.

300
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:15,433
[breathing shakily]

301
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:27,112
Does Manny know you know?

302
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:32,200
[sighs] I told him I was home
and feeling sick.

303
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:33,702
Only half a lie.

304
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:35,704
What happened?

305
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:38,957
[sighs] I don't know.

306
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:42,627
- He just...
- [sighs]

307
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:47,757
My God, he kept... asking about work.

308
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:50,300
- And you.
- [sighs]

309
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:53,054
But I-I didn't tell him anything, I swear.

310
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:55,974
I need your phone.

311
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:58,059
I have to check your messages.

312
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:00,228
You have to tell me everything.

313
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,817
[Parker] Holy shit.

314
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:08,527
- [Ballard] Yeah.
- You sure?

315
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:09,611
Yeah.

316
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:12,448
Martina figured it out.
She came to me right away.

317
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:14,992
Poor thing. She must be crushed.

318
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:18,413
That's what you're worried about?
She compromised us.

319
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:21,666
I saw all her text messages
and listened to her voicemails.

320
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:25,920
She wasn't complicit, but she did
bring him into the bullpen one night.

321
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:29,465
- So she exposed us unintentionally.
- Exactly.

322
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:32,010
Look, Martina's not the problem right now.
Manny is.

323
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:37,055
His burner is the 1922 number.

324
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,974
He was in close contact with Driscoll.

325
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:41,059
[Ballard] Which makes him privy to a lot.
[inhales deeply]

326
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,354
[sighs] He could blow this case wide open
but we need the right approach.

327
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:47,357
Dude works patrol, right?
So let's give him some patrol business.

328
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:49,943
A search warrant,
run down a drunk and disorderly.

329
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:51,904
And then we pull him aside,
give him the come-to-Jesus talk.

330
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:53,198
No, that would leave a paper trail.

331
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,075
What about his apartment?
He lives alone, right?

332
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:57,993
But we don't know who's watching.

333
00:17:57,994 --> 00:17:59,120
[Parker sighs]

334
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:01,956
- We've got company.
- [Ted sighs]

335
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,963
I called Chief Hughes,
tried to get you back on Sarah's case,

336
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:12,801
but she said the scope
was too big for your unit.

337
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:16,846
To be honest,
I think she's worried about the optics.

338
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:18,764
[scoffs]

339
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:21,434
I know how that must sound
coming from a politician.

340
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:25,271
But she says this Lidell guy's
one of the best.

341
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:32,362
And... I know how much time and effort
you and your team put in.

342
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:34,405
I'm sorry.

343
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:39,619
No apology needed.
This cannot be easy on you either.

344
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,333
[sighs]

345
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:48,877
Councilman... [sighs]

346
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:51,130
...Sarah's case gave this unit purpose.

347
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:53,383
I won't forget her.

348
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:55,927
[chuckles]

349
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,305
[Pearlman sighs]

350
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,810
- [sighs]
- Thank you, Detective.

351
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,145
Of course.

352
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,191
[sighs]

353
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:19,783
[Lidell] <i>Hi, you've reached
Detective Lidell.</i>

354
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:20,868
- [sighs]
- [tone beeps]

355
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:22,494
Hey, Lidell, it's Ballard.

356
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,914
Uh, if your hands are full, I'd be happy
to take the Pearlman case back.

357
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:29,168
Otherwise, call me back
so an innocent man doesn't rot in prison.

358
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,128
[whispers] Prick.

359
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:32,505
Martina.

360
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:36,425
He keeps texting me
and I keep sending him the vomit emoji.

361
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,010
But he wants to see me.

362
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,137
What do I do?

363
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:47,270
Sorry, uh, boss, all due respect.

364
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,523
That's the worst idea I've ever heard.

365
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,483
She is the reason
that we are in this mess.

366
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:55,152
- Hey!
- What? She is.

367
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:57,613
Sh-Sh-She's the reason
that we have a way in.

368
00:19:57,614 --> 00:19:59,072
- No.
- Okay, but she's not trained

369
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:01,325
- for undercover.
- No one said undercover.

370
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:03,035
Okay then, bait.

371
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:05,330
[scoffs] That makes so much more sense.

372
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:09,918
[chuckles]

373
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:11,585
[Ballard] Okay.

374
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:13,463
Does anyone have a better idea?

375
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:17,799
He trusts her.

376
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,885
I trust her too.

377
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,553
All she's doing is setting a meet
and getting him to the table.

378
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,347
Does she have to be on-site for that?

379
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:27,101
I wanna see his face
when he realizes he was burned.

380
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:32,941
[Martine clears throat]

381
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:37,653
You were a jerk back there.

382
00:20:37,654 --> 00:20:39,655
Anyone could have
made the mistake she made.

383
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:41,156
Anyone with actual feelings.

384
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:43,951
Feelings?
Feelings have no place in any of this.

385
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:46,454
Feelings are what
got her into trouble to begin with.

386
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:49,957
God, you never back us up.
Why can't you just support her?

387
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,460
Putting this in her hands is risky.

388
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:55,963
For the operation and for Martina.
She is an intern, for Christ's sake.

389
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:58,216
And you're a civilian
playing dress up as a cop.

390
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:00,258
[stammers]

391
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,636
- Maybe I don't wanna see her get hurt.
- [groans]

392
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:03,805
You ever think of that?

393
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:07,265
[Ballard] Yeah.
We can enter from the back.

394
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,934
I'd love you to stay and cover the back.

395
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:10,311
So, then you get out of your car, right?

396
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:12,897
Holy hell.

397
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:14,398
Hey, Ballard.

398
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:15,649
Yeah?

399
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:20,529
I... I narrowed it down to seven kids
who could be a match for Gael Ibarra.

400
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:21,613
- Gael?
- Yeah.

401
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:25,367
These are the addresses
where each one first entered the system,

402
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:26,536
but this one...

403
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:31,123
was surrendered at a firehouse
six blocks from the Sunbeam.

404
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:32,582
Well, that's a lead.

405
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:37,379
The name of the woman
who dropped him off was Renata Cardenas.

406
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,089
You got an address for Renata?

407
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,676
No. But I'll find one.

408
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:46,389
[sighs]

409
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:49,392
She's gonna be messed up about this
for a while.

410
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:52,978
Yeah.

411
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:54,981
[line ringing]

412
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:57,233
[Martina sniffles]

413
00:21:59,694 --> 00:22:01,194
[sighs, sniffles]

414
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:02,363
Hey.

415
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:05,867
How you doing?

416
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:09,536
[clicks tongue] I feel like a clown.

417
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:10,621
[clears throat]

418
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:12,831
[gasps]

419
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:15,418
[inhales sharply] Great.
Now I look like one.

420
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,799
I wanted to apologize to you, Martina.

421
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:24,217
If I had been honest
with you guys sooner--

422
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:27,179
It's not your fault.

423
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,431
I-I-It's mine.

424
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:33,436
- Don't do that.
- I put too much on.

425
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,022
Don't let him
make you think less of yourself.

426
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:38,858
[sighs]

427
00:22:39,442 --> 00:22:40,902
We can protect you.

428
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:45,740
But I need to know
if Manny carries his weapon off-duty.

429
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:51,037
[sighs] Um...

430
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:55,166
[clicks tongue] But he locks it in
the glove box if he's gonna be drinking.

431
00:22:58,503 --> 00:22:59,962
Are you sure you can do this?

432
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:05,843
[breathes shakily]

433
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:08,012
[sighs]

434
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:20,233
[pop music playing]

435
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:27,573
- You did good.
- [Manny] Sorry. Excused me.

436
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:36,289
Manny Santos? Detective Renée...

437
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:38,291
- Whoa.
- [grunts]

438
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:39,751
- [Ballard] Hey!
- [Ted] No!

439
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:41,586
- [patron] Hey!
- [Ted] Whoa! Hey!

440
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:42,672
[glass shatters]

441
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:46,383
[panting, grunting]

442
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:47,844
[grunts]

443
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:51,556
- Stay down!
- [grunts]

444
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:56,644
[panting, straining]

445
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:59,313
Who you running to, Manny? Huh?

446
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:01,107
Chuck Tolli?

447
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:02,817
Damen Pincher?

448
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:04,318
Maybe Bundshu?

449
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:05,862
Or Olivas?

450
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:11,284
They weren't even loyal to the badge.
You think they're gonna be loyal to you?

451
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:16,079
I can't... [whimpers]

452
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,622
Look, I c... I can't do this.

453
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:19,917
Consider your alternatives.

454
00:24:20,418 --> 00:24:21,752
- [grunts]
- We're the best you got.

455
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,840
[breathes shakily]
Look, you can't take me to a station.

456
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:30,261
If anyone finds out I'm talking to you...
[pants] ...I'm a dead man.

457
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:34,098
Should have thought of that
before you brought Martina into this.

458
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:35,933
Come on.

459
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:44,066
[exhales sharply]

460
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:48,905
Jesus.

461
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:52,699
Yeah. I'd pray if I were you too.

462
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,286
You can't intimidate my client
into a confession.

463
00:24:56,454 --> 00:24:58,455
Your client requested an off-site location

464
00:24:58,456 --> 00:25:00,832
because he's terrified
to go to the police station.

465
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:03,961
So, if he's intimidated, it's not by us.

466
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:07,632
[Parker] <i>Let's make this easy.</i>

467
00:25:08,591 --> 00:25:10,509
- <i>You have an opportunity...</i>
- Nice digs, by the way.

468
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:12,595
We could use your budget.

469
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:14,889
[clicks tongue]
Private clients, better toys.

470
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:18,351
[Parker] <i>You ID the other cops,
provide testimony,</i>

471
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:20,353
<i>there could be leniency.</i>

472
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:23,940
Driscoll pulled a trache
from his own throat,

473
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:27,068
because he knew what the cartel
would do to him would be worse.

474
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:29,612
You're burned, Manny.

475
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,406
You're just the only one
who knows it right now.

476
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:35,952
Don't you wanna keep it that way?

477
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:41,457
Come on. Come on.

478
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:51,550
[whispers indistinctly]

479
00:25:52,093 --> 00:25:54,053
[sniffles, clears throat]

480
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:00,643
<i>Okay.</i>

481
00:26:04,689 --> 00:26:07,066
My name is Officer Emmanuel Santos.

482
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:10,736
I'm cooperating of my own volition.

483
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:18,035
<i>I was part of a group of cops
across the LAPD</i>

484
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:23,582
that colluded with
the Zacatecas Nuevas Cartel.

485
00:26:27,962 --> 00:26:30,506
I am not this guy.

486
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,009
[inhales sharply] <i>I was just...</i>

487
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:35,969
I was just doing Driscoll favors.
You know?

488
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:38,930
And he took care of me. He never told me
how deep it went and then...

489
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:42,392
and then all of a sudden,
they're asking me to do crazy shit.

490
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:44,519
You mean they paid you to do crazy shit?

491
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,939
I mean, yeah,
but it's not like I could say no.

492
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:49,024
And I tried.

493
00:26:49,025 --> 00:26:50,608
I swear to God.

494
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:54,696
I tried to get them off Martina,
but Olivas pushed me to stay on her.

495
00:26:54,697 --> 00:26:56,532
Olivas is in charge?

496
00:26:58,284 --> 00:26:59,576
He is now.

497
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:00,953
I want everything.

498
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:04,332
Names, numbers, locations, meets.

499
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:07,585
If they check out,
I'll let the DA know you were helpful.

500
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:14,675
[Manny clears throat, sniffles]

501
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:17,970
[inhales sharply] Can I see Martina?

502
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,181
Please.

503
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:25,061
I just wanna tell her I'm sorry.

504
00:27:28,773 --> 00:27:29,774
It's not my choice.

505
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:39,992
I-I wanna go home.

506
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:47,875
[Ballard] <i>All right.</i>

507
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,252
<i>Start identifying.</i>

508
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:53,964
<i>That's Chuck Tolli.</i>

509
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:57,968
<i>He handled most of the drops to Driscoll.</i>

510
00:27:58,928 --> 00:28:00,095
[Ballard] <i>Driscoll ran this thing?</i>

511
00:28:00,096 --> 00:28:01,597
<i>He did. Yeah.</i>

512
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:05,142
<i>Now Olivas is in communication
with the cartel contact.</i>

513
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:07,770
<i>Keeps the whole operation on track.</i>

514
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:09,896
<i>And he's in charge of the cash.</i>

515
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:11,773
- [sniffles]
- [Ballard] <i>How so?</i>

516
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:13,609
- <i>Doles out the money to the other cops...</i>
- All right. Stop it.

517
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:15,736
[inhales deeply]

518
00:28:16,237 --> 00:28:18,488
How could you not have read me in
on this sooner?

519
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:20,573
You wouldn't have believed us
without proof.

520
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:22,618
Especially considering
Olivas's involvement.

521
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:24,995
Manny is that proof.

522
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:26,872
He can take 'em all down.

523
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:30,793
All right. [sighs]

524
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:32,877
I'll send notifications up the chain.

525
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:35,673
Sir, there's still two burner phones
that Manny can't ID.

526
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:40,177
They could belong to anyone on the Force,
so I think we need more than IA on this.

527
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:43,638
We need to bring in the feds
and maybe the DA's office.

528
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:45,349
- [sighs]
- I'll put something together.

529
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:50,271
Get someone to take him to county
until we sort out this shit show.

530
00:28:50,855 --> 00:28:52,982
He's already in a black-and-white.
Was just waiting for your word.

531
00:28:54,692 --> 00:28:55,860
I'll walk you out, Captain.

532
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:01,115
This is good work, Ballard.

533
00:29:01,866 --> 00:29:03,116
But I mean it, from now on,

534
00:29:03,117 --> 00:29:05,661
bring me in from the get-go
if you want me on your side.

535

538
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:23,721
He's calling it in.

[chuckles]

543
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:40,320
[inhales deeply, laughs]

544
00:29:40,321 --> 00:29:42,406
[inspirational melody playing]

545

[Lola whines]

546
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,491
[exhales heavily]

547
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:30,538
I got him, Tutu.

548
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,624
I got that son of a bitch.

549
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:40,631
[sighs heavily]

550
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:42,925
[sighs]

551
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,146
Why didn't you tell me?

552
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:58,941
Because I knew what you'd say.

553
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:04,988
That I was betraying my community.
That the institution is toxic.

554
00:31:04,989 --> 00:31:06,907
It's not about the institution, baby.

555
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:08,784
It never was.

556
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:13,330
I lost you the last time
you wore that badge.

557
00:31:14,415 --> 00:31:16,333
I saw the light drain right out of you.

558
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:19,211
I can't watch that happen again.

559
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,132
This time is gonna be different.

560
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:27,052
I'm taking back what I lost.

561
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:29,888
What does that mean?

562
00:31:33,726 --> 00:31:35,769
There's something else. Isn't it?

563
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:40,190
What is it?

564
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:56,040
[clicks tongue, sniffles]

565
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:57,875
My sweet baby girl.

566
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,260
["Sunflower" playing on radio]

567
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:32,910
Hey.

568
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:36,871
So, I spent all night listing
all the sons of bitches you know.

569
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:38,498
[chuckles, inhales deeply]

570
00:32:38,499 --> 00:32:39,792
I only came up with one.

571
00:32:43,796 --> 00:32:44,963
You finally got him.

572
00:32:45,673 --> 00:32:47,007
Yeah.

573
00:32:47,508 --> 00:32:50,302
And we got him for something
that's gonna put him away for a long time.

574
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:53,222
So I never have to think about
that guy again.

575
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:55,849
I bet he'll think about you, though.

576
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,351
Every day.

577
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:01,522
Men like him can't stand it
when we end up on top.

578
00:33:02,231 --> 00:33:03,232
[sighs]

579
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:07,152
[clicks tongue] Honey.

580
00:33:33,095 --> 00:33:35,681

[phone rings]

585
00:33:44,148 --> 00:33:46,149
Hey, what's up? I'm on my way in.

586
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,233
[Parker] <i>Hey.</i>

587

- Renata?
- <i>Yeah</i>.

589
00:33:51,739 --> 00:33:53,781
She actually worked
at the Sunbeam back then.

590
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:55,075
<i>ID'd Ibarra off a photo.</i>

591
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:58,328
He paid her 20 bucks to watch the kid
and he never came back.

592
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:00,247
Wow. [chuckles]

593
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:02,206
We found our Baby Doe.

594
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:03,292
Yeah, we sure did.

595
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:06,754
She couldn't afford him so she surrendered
him a couple weeks later.

596
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:09,213
Gael's been in the system ever since.

597
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:10,632
Guys, this is so great.

598
00:34:11,175 --> 00:34:12,925
Write up a warrant to get his DNA.

599
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:15,262
I'll review it when I get in.
I'm going to see Berchem first.

600
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:17,598
Is everything all right?

601
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:21,392
Better than all right. I've got
a new theory on the Pearlman case.

602
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:22,895
Too bad it's not ours anymore.

603
00:34:23,437 --> 00:34:24,937
Well, that's why I'm going to Berchem's.

604
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:26,315
I'll fill you in when I see you.

605
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:35,115
- Hi.
- Hey.

606
00:34:35,616 --> 00:34:37,576
I just finished my first shift on the bus.

607
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,744
Oh, that's right. I forgot. How did it go?

608
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:41,747
Kinda rough actually.

609
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:44,541
I'm sure you were great.

610
00:34:46,335 --> 00:34:47,668
[chuckles, stammers]

611
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:50,464
[scoffs] Look, I gotta go.
I promise I'll call you later.

612
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,596
{\an8}[Berchem] You're exhausting,
you know that, Ballard?

613
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:00,473
[Ballard] Yeah. So I've been told.

614
00:35:00,474 --> 00:35:03,184
I have a new theory I wanna work
but Lidell won't call me back.

615
00:35:03,185 --> 00:35:05,436
Theories don't make convictions.

616
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:07,147
That's why I need the case back, sir.

617
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:09,482
I need to see if I can make
heads or tails of it.

618
00:35:09,483 --> 00:35:10,609
I need the evidence.

619
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:16,406
How many times do I have to prove
that I deserve the authority to do my job?

620
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:20,952
I just uncovered another Rampart
that until a few weeks ago,

621
00:35:20,953 --> 00:35:22,621
was just a cold case in a box.

622
00:35:23,747 --> 00:35:24,748
[sighs]

623
00:35:26,542 --> 00:35:28,710
Come on, Captain.
This is me bringing you in.

624
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:34,383
You can have Pearlman back.

625
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:37,803
Just give me a few hours.

626
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:39,638
I gotta butter up the chief.

627
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:54,986
[Ballard] The connection between
these victims is not proximity. Right?

628
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:56,071
It's not looks.

629
00:35:56,864 --> 00:35:58,198
And it's not daily patterns.

630
00:35:58,699 --> 00:36:00,117
I think it's behavior.

631
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:02,911
These women were advancing.

632
00:36:03,537 --> 00:36:05,913
Ochoa's fiancé, she'd just gotten a job
as a paralegal.

633
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:08,876
She bought them a couple
of expensive gold bracelets to celebrate.

634
00:36:09,543 --> 00:36:12,795
Laura Wilson had just booked
her first national commercial campaign.

635
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:15,339
And Josie Culver was canvassing
for a woman

636
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,886
who was aiming to break the thickest
glass ceiling in American history.

637
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:24,266
What if our killer was punishing these
women for stepping out of their place?

638
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:29,229
We're pretty sure
he was stalking his victims.

639
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,898
It would make sense
he'd know about their lives.

640
00:36:31,899 --> 00:36:32,982
I like it.

641
00:36:32,983 --> 00:36:36,028
And the souvenirs
are symbols of their audacity.

642
00:36:36,737 --> 00:36:37,820
[Parker] Birth control.

643
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:38,989
That sure tracks.

644
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:41,407
Woman making choices for herself.

645
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:45,369
But I gotta say, you're usually
Miss Air-Tight-Evidence.

646
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,705
Now you're going on a hunch?

647
00:36:47,748 --> 00:36:49,958
Hunches can turn into evidence
if they're worked properly.

648
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:53,252
But... it's late.

649
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:56,631
I-I'll kick the tires tonight and then
we can all dig in tomorrow morning.

650
00:36:56,632 --> 00:36:58,758
[sighs] I don't know. I...

651
00:36:58,759 --> 00:37:00,510
It could be something.
It could be nothing.

652
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:04,639
We don't know until we work it.
So, I'll... I'll see you then.

653
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,723
- Right.
- Bye.

654
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:06,808
Good night.

655
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:12,564
[inhales sharply] Nothing comes to mind
with Sarah, though.

656
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:14,900
No "audacity," I mean.

657
00:37:16,193 --> 00:37:17,653
[sighs] Yeah.

658
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:21,697
It would help if we knew
which souvenir was hers.

659
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:23,240
Huh. Yeah.

660
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,368
[Ballard sighs]

661
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:28,746
Hey, how's Martina? I mean,
I figured she'd need some time off.

662
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:31,750
[inhales sharply] I'm about to find out.
I'm gonna go meet her now.

663
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:44,096
If you're kicking tires,
I can stay a while.

664
00:37:45,389 --> 00:37:47,099
I got a shift at the club later.

665
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:50,393
And I can keep you on your A-game.

666
00:37:50,394 --> 00:37:52,478
[chuckles] Thank you.

667
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:53,563
Mmm.

668
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:58,235
Hey, by the way,
Berchem heard from the DA's Office.

669
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:00,821
It's going down tomorrow morning.

670
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,325
[chuckles] Nice.

671
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:06,910
Mm-hmm.

672
00:38:11,123 --> 00:38:12,457
I told my mom.

673
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:16,128
About the badge.

674
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:17,629
About everything.

675
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:21,508
- And?
- [sighs]

676
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:24,094
I don't know what I was so afraid of.

677
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:34,938
[sighs] Should've known you'd sit here.

678
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:38,150
This was my bar before Manny showed up.

679
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:41,236
And it's gonna stay that way.

680
00:38:42,571 --> 00:38:45,072
[server] Two tequila shots.

681
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:46,991
Let me know if you need anything else.

682
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:48,284
[chuckles] What now?

683
00:38:48,285 --> 00:38:49,661
[chuckles]

684
00:38:50,454 --> 00:38:51,455
Oh.

685
00:38:53,415 --> 00:38:55,292
I wish I had your moxie
when I was your age.

686
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:59,128
Honestly, I wish I had your moxie now.

687
00:38:59,129 --> 00:39:00,297
[chuckles]

688
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:07,929
[Martina sighs]

689
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:09,972
- [gulps]
- [chuckles]

690
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:12,058
God, that's not good.

691
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:13,643
Why do people do this?

692
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,141
What is it?

693
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:36,725
It's lipstick.

694
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:39,229
It was found under Sarah's bed
like she dropped it there.

695
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:41,606
But she kept all her makeup
in the bathroom.

696
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,526
That's not Sarah's.

697
00:40:46,153 --> 00:40:47,154
How do you know?

698
00:40:47,863 --> 00:40:48,863
That's Othella.

699
00:40:48,864 --> 00:40:50,657
It's a brand for Black women.

700
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:53,326
Was it tested for DNA?

701
00:40:56,913 --> 00:40:57,955
I don't know.

702
00:40:57,956 --> 00:41:00,041
[tense music playing]

703
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:06,672
They got her prints
on the outside of the tube

704
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:08,383
but nothing about DNA.

705
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:14,973
There was no analysis done
on the lipstick inside.

706
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:17,893
Son of a bitch.

707
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:20,562
If it wasn't Sarah's, then whose was it?

708
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:26,942
Look, you be good today, okay, <i>mijo</i>.

709
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:28,611
All right. I'm gonna be working late,

710
00:41:28,612 --> 00:41:30,989
but your Mommy's gonna come,
and she's gonna pick you up, okay?

711
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:33,116
Love you. Go on.

712
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:39,830
- [parent] Oh, hey, Bobby.
- [chuckles]

713
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:41,790
I'm meeting some of the moms for coffee.
You wanna join?

714
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:44,126
Not today, Gina.
Got in trouble with the Mrs. last time.

715
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:45,461
- [chuckles]
- Maybe tomorrow.

716
00:41:45,462 --> 00:41:47,130
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

717
00:41:47,631 --> 00:41:48,840
[phone buzzing]

718
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:58,266
You don't call me, Manny. I call you.

719
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:01,269
- What do you want?
- [Ballard] <i>I just wanted to see your face.</i>

720
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:02,938
- [police sirens wailing]
- What?

721
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:11,195
[officer] LAPD. Olivas, hands up.

722
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:13,072
Hey, easy. Hey. You...

723
00:42:13,073 --> 00:42:14,574
[officer] Put your hands on your head.

724
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:17,618
[officer] Come on. Let's see your hands!

725
00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:18,703
Hands up!

726
00:42:21,248 --> 00:42:22,290
Do it!

727
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:33,426
[Olivas grunts]

728
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,437
You got no idea what you've done.
