1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:01,668
[Ballard] <i>Previously on</i> Ballard<i>...</i>

2
00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:04,295
Sarah Pearlman's killer left DNA behind
at another crime scene.

3
00:00:04,296 --> 00:00:07,799
It's another murder too.
A woman named Laura Wilson.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,718
- [Ballard] Any hunches?
- Harmon Harris.

5
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:12,762
Didn't have a motive for him,
but I didn't like his alibi.

6
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:17,434
The bullet from Yulia Kravetz's body was
indeed fired by the six-shooter you found.

7
00:00:17,435 --> 00:00:19,436
- Any hits in the system?
- No. Nothing.

8
00:00:19,437 --> 00:00:20,812
Not even on my John Doe?

9
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:23,815
Turns out that bullet from that case
was never even analyzed.

10
00:00:23,816 --> 00:00:25,024
You sure?

11
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,068
I called in that bullet to be analyzed.

12
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:30,780
I'm telling you someone in the LAPD
let John Doe's murder go cold.

13
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:35,618
I do wonder if running cold cases
is proving to be a secondary trauma.

14
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:38,246
[Ava] <i>It's a position you were
forced into precisely</i>

15
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:40,999
<i>because your brothers in blue
turned their backs on you.</i>

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,001
- Have a good day, Renée.
- [Manny] <i>Case closed.</i>

17
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:45,128
<i>She arrested the shooter.
You know he's a dead end.</i>

18
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:46,838
Can't even string a sentence together.

19
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:48,840
Sure, I could have a little fun with that.

20
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:50,760
She won't know what hit her.

21
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:22,583
[inhales deeply, sighs]

22
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:26,045
Why ain't you at home sleeping
in your bed after that late night shift?

23
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:29,130
You give me heartburn just thinking
about you working at that club.

24
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:30,633
It's fine, Mama.

25
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:32,760
[Rolanda] So you just not gonna sleep now?

26
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:34,469
Errands to run.

27
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,555
Besides, he's sleeping enough
for the both of us.

28
00:01:38,057 --> 00:01:39,266
[kisses] Love you, Paw Paw.

29
00:01:39,934 --> 00:01:42,852
All former military,
curated to your needs.

30
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:43,978
But, hey, ask around.

31
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:47,190
You might find a cheaper package
at some other security company,

32
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:49,275
but nobody is gonna be better.

33
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:50,777
And let me ask you something, Craig.

34
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:53,988
W-When it comes to safety,
should money really be a factor?

35
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:56,242
Hmm? Uh-huh.

36
00:01:58,661 --> 00:01:59,661
Amazing. Okay.

37
00:01:59,662 --> 00:02:03,374
I'll have April in our office,
uh, send you paperwork by EOD.

38
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,084
Okay. We'll chat soon.

39
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:06,919
Bye. [chuckles]

40
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,151
How is it out there?

41
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,821
Oh, easy swells. Not much to catch though.

42
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:35,656
Perfect day to practice.

43
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,157
Thanks.

44
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,787
[barking]

45
00:02:43,414 --> 00:02:45,206
- [dog whimpers]
- Hey, girl.

46
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:46,959
[sighs] Time for some bacon.

47
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:49,419
- [kisses]
- [indistinct laptop chatter]

48
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,837
Marti, I need ten bucks.

49
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:53,214
[sighs, stammers] Yeah, it's in my bag.

50
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:54,508
[chuckles]

51
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:01,097
- [Martina's mom speaking Spanish]
- [sighs]

52
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:05,184
[snores] Oh. Ralph, no. Oh, okay.

53
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,229
Okay. All right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

54
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,065
- [grunts]
- Morning, sunshine.

55
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:14,319
- [groans]
- [chuckles, sniffles]

56
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,947
[sighs, grunts]

57
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:24,246
[Tutu] Surprise.

58
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,957
You used to love watching
your dad build his boards.

59
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,459
Now is not the time, Tutu.

60
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,128
Come on. Hobbies are healthy.

61
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:34,422
- Help me move it into the shed.
- No, really. I gotta get to work.

62
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:35,840
I got a meeting with the captain.

63
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,467
Okay, but there's plenty
of space in there,

64
00:03:37,468 --> 00:03:40,054
- a-and the light's good--
- Tutu, send it back.

65
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,351
Any idea what that was about?

66
00:03:55,486 --> 00:03:57,404
[Ballard] Waze says 34 minutes to PAB.

67
00:03:58,822 --> 00:03:59,989
You could cut over sooner.

68
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,991
No. You know I like the coast.

69
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:04,535
[chuckles] What does the Captain
wanna talk to you about anyway?

70
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:06,162
<i>I was kind of wondering that myself.</i>

71
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:07,246
But I've been working.

72
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,792
I sent Parker to Property to pick up
that bullet from the John Doe case.

73
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:12,543
Probably before you got out of bed.

74
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:15,714
Probably. But I dug something up.

75
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:18,675
Hey, speak of the devil.
I got Berchem calling.

76
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:21,135
[Laffont]
<i>All right. I'll hold. Rank before beauty.</i>

77
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:23,137
[chuckles] Good morning, sir.

78
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:24,973
- You on your way?
- [Ballard] <i>Uh, yeah.</i>

79
00:04:24,974 --> 00:04:26,057
<i>I thought you said 9:00.</i>

80
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:29,394
I did, but the Chief's riding me about
a cold case blowing up on social media.

81
00:04:29,395 --> 00:04:30,771
I need you in my office now.

82
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:33,356
All right. I'm on my way downtown
as we speak.

83
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:34,441
[Berchem] <i>Peachy.</i>

84
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,150
Hey, sorry.

85
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:38,028
[Ballard]
<i>You were saying you dug something up?</i>

86
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:41,364
Yeah. On the suspect
in Laura Wilson's murder.

87
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:42,448
Harmon Harris.

88
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:43,534
The acting coach?

89
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:47,120
Yeah, Bosch said his alibi seemed off.
You get an address?

90
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:49,664
Forest Lawn. Heart attack two years ago.

91
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:51,749
That's what you meant
about digging something up?

92
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,835
[chuckles]

93
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:57,047
Can you ask Berchem when you see him
for a-a warrant to exhume?

94
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,675
Whoa. Don't you think
we're getting ahead of ourselves?

95
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:04,178
Look, if his DNA matches
the palm-print at Sarah's bedroom,

96
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:07,849
case closed and Jake Pearlman
will keep our little unit chugging.

97
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,811
And if it doesn't,
I've disturbed an innocent corpse.

98
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,522
Berchem's my only ally right now.
I can't afford to piss him off.

99
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:15,606
Mmm. Copy that.

100
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:20,403
[sighs] I'll try to track down the guy
who said he was with Harmon that night.

101
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:22,530
We may be able to make some hay there.

102
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:24,533
All right. I'll talk to you soon.

103
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,995
[scoffs] Dug something up. [chuckles]

104
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:32,582
[protestor]
<i>This fraternity murdered my brother!</i>

105
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,709
[protestors clamoring]

106
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:38,880
{\an8}<i>You're arresting me? You're arresting me?
They murdered my brother!</i>

107
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:41,841
{\an8}[Berchem] Raquel Thatcher.
Kid on the shirt is her brother, Nick.

108
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:44,928
He fell off a balcony
at his fraternity house back in '06.

109
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:47,096
Manner of death was undetermined.

110
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,598
- Not to her.
- Yeah.

111
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:51,017
She's certain some
of the members back then were involved.

112
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:53,686
Still had a warrant out
for the last time she did this.

113
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,397
So she gets arrested
and social media does the rest.

114
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:57,482
Exactly.

115
00:05:57,483 --> 00:05:59,443
Local news did a segment this morning.

116
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:02,403
Of course that led to a bunch
of social justice warriors

117
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:03,696
jumping on the Chief about it.

118
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:04,781
So now it's our problem.

119
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:08,076
- And, sir, by our problem, you mean...
- Yours.

120
00:06:08,077 --> 00:06:10,620
The original investigator died in 2020.

121
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:13,623
So gather your team.
I need all hands on deck for this.

122
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:17,002
A thorough review.
Make sure everything's crossed and dotted.

123
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:20,254
What do I do about Pearlman, sir?
He's all over me--

124
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:22,633
Put it on the back burner.
I'll deal with the Councilman.

125
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,593
You just focus on this.

126
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:26,135
Yes, sir.

127
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,388
[whirring]

128
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:32,391
You know, protein powder would flush
that Gen Z hangover of yours

129
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,185
way more than caffeine.

130
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:37,272
She's not hungover. She's exhausted.
She studies at night.

131
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:39,565
Oh, yeah? How do you know that?

132
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,402
'Cause we converse. You should try it.

133
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:48,116
- [Martina gasps] We have a rodent.
- [Colleen gasps] You saw the mouse?

134
00:06:48,117 --> 00:06:49,784
Oh, you knew about this?

135
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:50,910
[stammers] It's a good omen.

136
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:53,037
- They carry diseases, Colleen.
- Oh. [scoffs]

137
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:57,333
A change in plan from Ballard.
Captain's got us working on a new case.

138
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:58,459
Something about a fraternity.

139
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:01,463
I'll grab the box.
We can start on the new board.

140
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:03,465
[Ted] Here, kitty, kitty.

141
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,972
She the victim from the motel?

142
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:13,516
Yulia.

143
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:15,310
I decided I want to find her parents.

144
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:18,146
They deserve to know what happened to her.

145
00:07:18,147 --> 00:07:21,650
Solid. My mom freaks
when I don't pick up the phone.

146
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:28,406
[Raquel] My brother called me
in the middle of the night.

147
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:31,243
Sometimes so drunk he could barely talk.

148
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:32,952
Other times, I don't know.

149
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:36,123
He would try to hide it,
but I could tell that he was scared.

150
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:37,832
Scared of what?

151
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:42,545
The forced drinking, the dangerous stunts,
the physical violence.

152
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:44,797
He said it was out of control.

153
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,008
[sighs]

154
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,509
So, the original detective on the case.

155
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,969
- Did he--
- He didn't listen.

156
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,890
He chalked the whole thing up
to boys being boys.

157
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,808
And Nick's so-called brothers

158
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:59,271
stonewalled from day one to protect
each other. They're still doing it.

159
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:05,903
Nick didn't just fall off of that balcony.

160
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:17,246
Vic's BAC was .18.

161
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,457
That's on the low end
of alcohol poisoning,

162
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,209
but he was sloppy drunk.

163
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:23,794
Which fits the accident theory
more than murder.

164
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:26,505
Hmm. Seems like that's what
the original investigator thought.

165
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,174
Right. He was pulled
onto some gang killings

166
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:31,177
that hit the city at the same time.
No wonder it's a cold case.

167
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,221
And the only thing that jumps out in here

168
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:36,224
i-is there's an altercation
between Nick and a fellow pledge.

169
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:38,100
- Yeah, I see that. Kyle Barnett.
- Yeah, yeah.

170
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,394
They got into it
a few hours before Nick died.

171
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:43,522
Now, Kyle said the argument was about
girls, no big deal, didn't get physical.

172
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,400
But he's also the one who found the body

173
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:49,905
along with a couple other pledges,
so he might be worth a second look.

174
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:53,032
We need to get updated statements
from all of them.

175
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,825
So let's see who's attending the reunion.

176
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,662
- Already on it.
- [Ballard] Great.

177
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,206
Have you looked at this autopsy report?

178
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:02,709
Yeah. Everything seemed in line
with a fall from twenty feet.

179
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,212
[phone vibrating]

180
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:12,843
So, we have a fractured tibia, right side.

181
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,638
Two broken ribs, right side.

182
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:16,430
Abrasions right side.

183
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:17,933
Paints a pretty clear picture.

184
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:21,060
And a detached left retina.

185
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,145
Left?

186
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:27,234
You think something
happened before the fall?

187
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:28,944
[stammers] Could be.

188
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:32,780
Let's find these guys, see if they
have more to say after all this time.

189
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:33,949
[sighs]

190
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,869
Is that a new tie-shirt combo?

191
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:39,997
Yeah.

192
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:43,833
It's Leo.

193
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:45,836
[phone buzzes]

194
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,089
What's up?

195
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,923
Now?

196
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,009
Well, what's the problem?

197
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:55,928
I can't keep driving across town
because you don't have full access.

198
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,431
This unit is small enough.

199
00:09:57,973 --> 00:09:59,725
- If you had your reserve badge--
- I know.

200
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:02,268
I had Jake Pearlman put you
at the head of the line.

201
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:05,563
I know. Okay?
All I need is my firearms qualification.

202
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:06,648
So get it.

203
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:09,483
Whatever suspicions you have
about John Doe and this bullet,

204
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:12,278
we have a better chance of
figuring it out once you're reinstated.

205
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,612
Okay.

206
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,074
Ladies, do we finally have a badge?

207
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,701
Yeah, you can release the bullet now.

208
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:20,704
Actually, I can't. It doesn't exist.

209
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:24,957
Check again.
I brought it from the morgue myself.

210
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,712
Yep. I saw that in the chain of custody.
But then the bullet was dispo'd.

211
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,590
- You can't be serious.
- That's what it says in the log.

212
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:34,134
Who the hell would do that?

213
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:38,346
- I want a copy of that dispo order.
- What am I, a magician?

214
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:40,974
- That was five years ago.
- I believe in you.

215
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:45,353
Give me some time.

216
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:46,772
I'll try to track it down.

217
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:53,862
You ready to admit I'm right now?

218
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:55,697
Outside.

219
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:01,952
Look, it's one thing to
let a John Doe go unsolved.

220
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:03,914
But they destroyed the damn evidence?

221
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:05,748
This is a cover-up.

222
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:07,166
We don't have solid proof of that.

223
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,168
I'm sorry. Did you not hear
what that man just said?

224
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,878
I heard what he said.

225
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:13,547
But right now we don't know that
that bullet wasn't dispo'd by accident.

226
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:14,674
Accident?

227
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:18,761
Ballard. Why can't you see
what's right in front of you?

228
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:22,265
Because I know the risk of making
accusations without airtight proof.

229
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:24,142
You wanna help me?

230
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:26,103
Get your goddamn badge.

231
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,696
Who would order a bullet to be
destroyed in an unsolved murder?

232
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,534
Sometimes mistakes are made.

233
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:42,868
That's a whopper.

234
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:45,037
Until we have more information,
we work the case other ways.

235
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,247
Or we could just shelve it.

236
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:48,332
It's got low solvability
written all over it.

237
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,000
And we wonder why cases go cold.

238
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:51,585
We're not shelving it, but right now

239
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:53,504
Berchem wants us
to focus on the fraternity case.

240
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:54,839
So where are we at?

241
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,924
Actually, I think we got lucky.

242
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:59,176
Kyle Barnett is in town for the reunion.

243
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:02,263
His Instagram's public
and there's a day-drinking thing

244
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:04,307
at a bougie golf resort in the Valley.

245
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,434
I could go for a spritzer.

246
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:07,810
[golf club thwacks]

247
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:10,354
Any updates on Harmon
Harris's alibi witness?

248
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:12,898
I thought we weren't working
the Pearlman case right now.

249
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,859
Well, you can't expect me
to forget about it.

250
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,194
And if I had to guess,
you probably haven't either.

251
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:18,571
His name is Adam Lennox.

252
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:21,866
His DMV address wasn't current,
but I found him on LinkedIn.

253
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:23,618
He works on-set catering.

254
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:27,705
Guess his acting career never took off,
but he didn't want to give up show biz.

255
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:29,541
Kind of like me ending up in cold cases.

256
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:35,421
Are you sure you're not...
[sighs] ...overthinking this?

257
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:38,132
That comment about
Berchem being your only ally.

258
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:40,426
I mean, the Brotherhood
hasn't exactly showered me with,

259
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,262
uh, support in the last few months.

260
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:48,350
Cops can be assholes.

261
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:49,728
Doesn't make it personal.

262
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:51,228
Sure.

263
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:52,313
Asshole cops I can handle,

264
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:55,066
but they shouldn't have
booted me from Homicide, and they know it.

265
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,945
I rushed at Michigan. Didn't get in.

266
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:00,821
Probably for the best.

267
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:03,949
One way or the other,
I would've been in confession every day.

268
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,327
[chuckles]

269
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:10,539
Uh, there's our fella right there.

270
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,001
[chuckles, speaks indistinctly]

271
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:15,086
Yeah. Of course.

272
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:17,296
- [chuckles]
- Kyle Barnett?

273
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,299
I'm Detective Ballard. You got a minute?

274
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:22,468
Let me guess. This is about Nick?

275
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:25,597
We drew the short straw.
Need to follow up on the investigation.

276
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:30,684
I get it. And I feel for his sister,
but what happened was an accident.

277
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,311
All right. Well, this won't take long.

278
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,481
We just need to know what
you remember from that night.

279
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:37,608
We also need to talk to
another few witnesses.

280
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:40,987
Have you seen, uh,
Dan Gibson or Joey Lucas this weekend?

281
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:43,614
Yeah, that's Dan.

282
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:45,616
Joey's over there.
You want me to grab 'em for you?

283
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:48,285
Oh, I appreciate that,
but we'll just add 'em to our dance card.

284
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:49,996
[people chattering and laughing]

285
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:54,626
Joey, Dan and I had cleanup duty
the morning after the party.

286
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,253
We got to the house around 7:00.

287
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:58,797
And that's when we found him.

288
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:02,675
We, uh,
thought he was just passed out at first.

289
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:04,469
You guys had been drinking
the night before?

290
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,762
Probably a fair bet.

291
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:07,972
Any of it forced?

292
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:09,139
[Dan] Forced?

293
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:14,311
No, I mean, we were hazed, sure,
but it was fun, and Nick was all in.

294
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:17,774
And did you witness the fight he had
with Kyle earlier that night?

295
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:20,235
I was there, yeah.

296
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,653
I'd hardly call it a fight. [chuckles]

297
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:26,283
It was just a disagreement. It was stupid.

298
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:29,910
- It didn't get physical?
- [Kyle] Definitely not.

299
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:31,787
They just had too much to drink.

300
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:34,707
And you can't remember anyone who
may have held a grudge against Nick?

301
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,418
No, he had tons of friends.

302
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:39,503
He was chill.

303
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:40,921
Everyone liked the guy.

304
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:42,840
What makes you think someone had a grudge?

305
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:45,259
Well, one of his injuries
suggests that he may have been hit

306
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,469
in the head before he fell.

307
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:49,389
Oh. That's weird.

308
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:52,141
Um, no.

309
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:53,602
I-I wish I could help you more.

310
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:57,105
That's too bad. [clears throat]

311
00:14:57,856 --> 00:15:00,609
Well, if you can
think of anything else, give us a call.

312
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:02,861
Okay. You got it.

313
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:08,825
They're hiding something.

314
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,493
Mm-hmm.

315
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,916
Who do we think would
be the first to fess up?

316
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:19,501
Well, Kyle and Dan are both lawyers.

317
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:21,379
Successful. Married with kids.

318
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,589
Joey Lucas is a manager at Kohl's.

319
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,717
[gasps] Ooh, I love that store.

320
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:29,137
They have good deals.

321
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:31,347
No kids.

322
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:32,931
Divorced a few years ago.

323
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,642
Less to lose than the other two.

324
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:36,269
He'd be my bet.

325
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:38,646
Okay, good. Let's start there.

326
00:15:38,647 --> 00:15:39,938
Rawls, you were in a frat, right?

327
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,733
I was in a fraternity actually.

328
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:44,068
You wouldn't call your country a--

329
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:45,570
Okay, okay. We get it.

330
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,698
All right, <i>Animal House</i>.
You're coming with me.

331
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:07,174
I told you everything I remember.

332
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:08,884
- You sure?
- What?

333
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:10,136
I have nothing to hide.

334
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:12,972
You know, I was in a fraternity.

335
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,349
- [sighs] Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

336
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,477
We pulled some dumb shit.

337
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,521
And I remember every time
one of us got in trouble,

338
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:22,398
the brotherhood always closed ranks.

339
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,692
Code of silence and all that.

340
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:27,987
But this isn't a stolen keg
or paying for a term paper.

341
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:31,031
Murder is a whole other ball game.

342
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:32,157
Whoa, whoa. Hold on a second.

343
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,118
You think your brothers
will close ranks for you now?

344
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:38,540
They have their big houses to protect
and their families, their firms.

345
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,834
Which is why they'll throw you
under the bus first chance they get.

346
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,335
But I didn't do anything.

347
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,380
You and your friends are hiding something.

348
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:51,385
[sighs] Look... [sighs]

349
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:53,680
I swear to God we thought Nick fell off
that balcony.

350
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:57,933
But y-yesterday when you were
talking about how you thought

351
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:01,229
he might've been hit in the head,
it made us think.

352
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:02,897
About what?

353
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,859
[stammers] There was this book.

354
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,445
We, um,
found it near Nick's body that morning.

355
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:12,365
And I told Dan to move it
before the cops showed up.

356
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:14,783
- Why?
- Well, we...

357
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:18,120
We just assumed, no harm, no foul,
he was looking through it when he fell.

358
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:20,748
And now you think it's possible
someone could've hit him with it?

359
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:22,332
[sighs] I-I don't know.

360
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,625
Maybe?

361
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:24,960
Still, why move it?

362
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,547
[sighs] There were some details in it.

363
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:30,591
[stammers] House secrets.

364
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:32,927
Stuff we didn't want the cops to see.

365
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:37,932
Look, it's not something I'm proud of.

366
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:41,311
[student 1] Yo, the cops are here.

367
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:45,063
Relax. We're just here for the book.

368
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,775
I don't know what you're talking about.
And don't you need, like, a warrant?

369
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:48,942
Listen, buddy.

370
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:51,945
You make her come back with a warrant,
she's gonna tear this place to pieces.

371
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:53,822
- Trust me.
- Can you just give me a sec?

372
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:54,948
Oh, yeah.

373
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:56,910
- We got nothing but time.
- [chuckles]

374
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,121
- [student 2] You guys seen my backpack?
- [student 3 yelling]

375
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:02,831
That the balcony?

376
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:03,917
Yeah.

377
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:05,752
Yeah. That'll do it.

378
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:08,922
It's this way.

379
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,426
[chuckling]

380
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:16,930
- You lived like this?
- Yeah. Jake and I.

381
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,974
We roomed together
for two years at Fullerton.

382
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:22,894
Just before Sarah died.

383
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:26,606
I didn't know that.

384
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:29,900
No one's added to them in years.

385
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:32,862
They're just, I don't know, house history,
but that's all.

386
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,872
[clears throat]
Who else knows about these?

387
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:26,457
Just brothers. They're a secret.

388
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:28,835
Not anymore.

389
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:31,963
It's like a twisted review system.

390
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:34,424
"Took it like a champ."

391
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:37,301
Wow.

392
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:39,303
Just when you think you've seen it all.

393
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:40,596
Colleen, Martina.

394
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:44,725
Once SID has them processed, I'm
gonna need you to go through all of these.

395
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:47,227
Log anything that seems
even remotely nonconsensual,

396
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:49,646
and we will turn it over
to West Bureau Sex Crimes.

397
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:51,690
Anything in there we can use for our case?

398
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,526
Actually, our victim made an entry.

399
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:56,737
Nick slept with Lucy Duncan
the day before he died.

400
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:58,113
They didn't bring her in?

401
00:19:58,114 --> 00:19:59,990
The investigators didn't know
about the books before,

402
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:02,785
and they didn't interview
anyone outside of the fraternity.

403
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:06,623
So let's find her first thing, see
what she knows about Nick's scrapbooking.

404
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:19,344
[ominous music plays]

405
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,743
- [radio chatter]
- I saw you moved that box to the shed.

406
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,663
Thought I asked you to return it.

407
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:49,915
Thirteen letter word for ungrateful.

408
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,917
[sighs] Oh, that's right.

409
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:53,126
Granddaughter.

410
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:55,421
All right.
I'll just have a bonfire on the beach.

411
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:57,547
I'll get the marshmallows.

412
00:20:57,548 --> 00:21:00,468
But before you do, look what I found.

413
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:04,346
His first build didn't make it
past the rail bands, but this one...

414
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:08,685
Tutu, I'm not building that board,
and I'm late for a meeting.

415
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:17,234
[sighs]

416
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:18,860
[dogs barking]

417
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:21,989
Hey, make it half-caf.
And get me one of those protein bars.

418
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,073
Yep.

419
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:25,576
[ominous music plays]

420
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,595
So we're at the end
of your mandated sessions.

421
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:48,599
But, Renée,
I do feel like there's more to talk about.

422
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:51,769
- [sighs]
- [chuckles]

423
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:55,647
It's hard being
the person no one wants to see.

424
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:56,857
Yeah.

425
00:21:56,858 --> 00:21:58,317
I know the feeling. [chuckles]

426
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:01,362
But I think I'm in a good place now.

427
00:22:02,697 --> 00:22:06,409
You can almost pull that off,
but I'm trained to know better.

428
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:11,329
Kind of funny, really,
that you're working in cold cases.

429
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,665
You've got a few to deal with yourself.

430
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,126
With your dad's death.

431
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:16,919
With Olivas.

432
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:19,422
Traumas you've put up on the shelf.

433
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:23,842
But there's a danger to
keeping all that hidden away.

434
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,011
[sighs]

435
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:33,728
Whenever you're ready to unpack, I'm here.

436
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,444
You get locked in last night?

437
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:44,863
Oh, my God. I fell asleep.

438
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,865
I've never seen a work walk of shame.

439
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:47,950
I'm sorry.

440
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:52,205
It's impossible to study at home.
I just needed someplace quiet.

441
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:54,540
It won't happen again.

442
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:56,750
How many more years of undergrad?

443
00:22:56,751 --> 00:22:58,211
This is my last one.

444
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:03,299
Should be done already, but I had to
take a break to help my parents out.

445
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:07,385
I'll make sure you
have building access 24/7.

446
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,680
Couch is yours, any night till 9:00 a.m.

447
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:12,850
Wow, thanks.

448
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:15,519
- It's 9:20.
- Yeah.

449
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,604
Ballard.

450
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:21,609
Ah. So you are a magician after all.

451
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:25,320
Charlie Grant. Got it.

452
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:27,740
Can you, uh,
send me a copy of the dispo order?

453
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:32,869
We found Lucy Duncan, Nick Thatcher's
last known hookup, living in San Diego.

454
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,747
She's driving up here
first thing tomorrow.

455
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:38,166
Do we even have an interview room?

456
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:39,877
- Um...
- Can you fix that?

457
00:23:40,962 --> 00:23:41,963
Parker.

458
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:51,013
Dispo order?

459
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:53,306
Who signed for it?

460
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:54,642
Guy named Charlie Grant.

461
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:57,936
That name doesn't ring any bells.

462
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,396
He wasn't on the John Doe case.

463
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:01,815
Do you have an address?
Let's go talk to him.

464
00:24:01,816 --> 00:24:02,984
Well, I looked him up.

465
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:05,861
He worked Gangs
with Laffont back in the day.

466
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:06,987
So I'm gonna be roping him in.

467
00:24:06,988 --> 00:24:08,364
Is that a good idea?

468
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:10,073
You said it yourself.

469
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:12,117
We were gonna play this close
until we have more intel.

470
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:15,745
Yes, I did, but Laffont was
my partner for seven years.

471
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:16,997
Best one I had.

472
00:24:16,998 --> 00:24:18,999
Not only can we trust him, we need him.

473
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,083
Hey.

474
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:21,626
You were making a house call?

475
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,170
Is this a break in the Thatcher case?

476
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:25,840
No, but I'll fill you in
on the way there. [sighs]

477
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:27,466
Hey.

478
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:39,436
[smacks teeth] Welcome to the B-team, sis.

479
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:40,646
Uh-uh.

480
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:49,947
Could be nothing, you know?

481
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:53,533
Cover-up on a John Doe murder
seems like a reach.

482
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:55,202
Just because you came up with the guy

483
00:24:55,203 --> 00:24:56,786
doesn't mean he's not
capable of going bad.

484
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:59,623
[scoffs] Charlie Grant was working Vice
at the time John Doe was killed.

485
00:24:59,624 --> 00:25:00,874
He was nowhere near the case.

486
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:02,834
Then why is his name on the dispo order?

487
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:05,171
He'd have no reason
to want that bullet destroyed.

488
00:25:05,922 --> 00:25:07,505
- It's hinky.
- Ah, yes.

489
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,799
The cornerstone
of the criminal justice system.

490
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,385
Innocent until proven hinky.

491
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:14,263
What gives, Tommy?

492
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:18,476
I hear you're on crypt duty
at the Ahmanson. [chuckles]

493
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:21,144
Can't enjoy retirement unless you take it.

494
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:24,189
- Yeah. Couldn't stay away.
- [chuckles] Yeah.

495
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:27,984
Actually, uh, Detective Ballard and I,
we're looking into a John Doe case

496
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:30,487
you were working about
a month before you hung it up.

497
00:25:30,488 --> 00:25:31,822
Not me, bud. [laughs]

498
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:34,950
I was busy making
my Irish goodbyes every night

499
00:25:34,951 --> 00:25:36,409
last four months on duty.

500
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,995
Captain let me burn my time.

501
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:40,205
No case work. [chuckles]

502
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:43,417
Vic was undocumented,
found executed in the foothills.

503
00:25:44,794 --> 00:25:45,877
I worked Vice, honey.

504
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:49,589
What am I supposed to know
about some illegal getting whacked?

505
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:53,177
The bullet that killed him is missing from
Property, and you signed the dispo order.

506
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:56,347
What's she talking about, Tommy?

507
00:25:57,223 --> 00:26:00,517
You know she has a habit
of making false accusations,

508
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:03,728
and she almost ruined a good man's career.

509
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:05,897
- [paper rustles]
- If you had nothing to do with it,

510
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,566
why is your signature on the dispo order?

511
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:12,154
That is not my signature.

512
00:26:14,699 --> 00:26:15,866
[sighs]

513
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,122
Does that look the same to you?

514
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:25,543
Yeah.

515
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:27,253
Know your place.

516
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,047
Now get her the hell out of my house.

517
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:34,051
And, Tommy, watch your back.

518
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:37,013
A tiger doesn't change her stripes.

519
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:46,980
[engine cranks]

520
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:48,441
Forget about him.

521
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:51,192
You said you could handle asshole cops.

522
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:53,362
I can. As long as my partner has my back.

523
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,489
I don't need you to humor me, all right?

524
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:57,825
I need you to believe me.

525
00:26:58,868 --> 00:27:02,913
If they forged some boozer's signature
to disappear a bullet,

526
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:05,248
that's a cover-up. Period.

527
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:06,333
Yeah.

528
00:27:06,334 --> 00:27:07,500
We gotta hold this close.

529
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:10,420
People will do anything
to keep their secrets buried,

530
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:13,131
and when they've got a gun and a badge,
it's that much worse.

531
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:14,717
It's you, me, and Parker.

532
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:16,509
That's it.

533
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,387
But I gotta see where her head's at.

534
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,181
[sighs]

535
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:23,975
[engine cranks]

536
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:26,812
- And for the record, Renée...
- [engine starts]

537
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:28,689
...I will always have your back.

538
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:57,259
[phone buzzes]

539
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:08,604
[Paw Paw] Hey.

540
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:11,649
There's a day I remember.

541
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:14,193
[chuckles] Yeah.

542
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:17,654
Mama's car got towed during the ceremony.

543
00:28:17,655 --> 00:28:18,947
[both laugh]

544
00:28:18,948 --> 00:28:20,198
She was so mad.

545
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:22,535
No. That's not why I remember.

546
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:31,001
That's the day I knew I had someone
who'd understand what I'd gone through.

547
00:28:34,088 --> 00:28:35,339
What if I don't understand?

548
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:38,676
Paw Paw, I wanna go back.

549
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:40,635
I do,

550
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:44,264
but it's rotten from the inside,

551
00:28:44,265 --> 00:28:47,560
and I don't really know what to do.

552
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:49,854
I don't know what to do.

553
00:28:54,525 --> 00:28:56,068
[worker] Order up for Ballard.

554
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:58,737
Thanks.

555
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:04,325
[dial tone plays]

556
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:05,660
<i>It's Zamira, you know what to do.</i>

557
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:07,912
- [beeps]
- Parker, trying to reach you.

558
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:09,290
Call me back. I need to talk.

559
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:11,792
Someone ducking your call?

560
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,045
Doesn't feel so good, does it?

561
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:19,592
You know, I figured I'd find you here.
Wing night.

562
00:29:20,468 --> 00:29:21,468
What do you want, Ken?

563
00:29:21,469 --> 00:29:23,888
Oh, come on, I don't even get a hello?

564
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,848
- Did you drive here?
- I had a few beers, okay?

565
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:27,933
Jesus.

566
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:29,643
Look, this is...

567
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:31,520
The...

568
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:33,606
The elevator the other day.

569
00:29:34,982 --> 00:29:36,274
Those guys were out of line.

570
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:37,359
Yeah?

571
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,569
Did you stick up for me?

572
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:41,196
Oh, wait. You don't do that.

573
00:29:41,197 --> 00:29:44,157
My God, Renée,
you're making this really hard, all right?

574
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:46,034
I'm just trying tell you that I'm...
I'm sorry.

575
00:29:46,035 --> 00:29:47,119
What are you sorry for?

576
00:29:49,163 --> 00:29:50,164
Olivas.

577
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:51,873
You know, and-and all that.

578
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:53,041
You're sorry he assaulted me,

579
00:29:53,042 --> 00:29:55,961
or you sorry that you didn't believe me
when I told you what he did?

580
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:59,047
You were... You were my partner,
and I sh... should've had your back.

581
00:29:59,048 --> 00:30:01,425
I wasn't just your partner,
I was your fucking friend!

582
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:04,845
You know what kills me about this?

583
00:30:05,513 --> 00:30:08,264
You're not here for me,
you're here for you and your own guilt.

584
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:09,933
- No, I-I'm-- [stammers]
- You're an asshole!

585
00:30:09,934 --> 00:30:11,434
I just want us to be okay, Renée.

586
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:12,519
- I just--
- No. No!

587
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,063
- Get off me!
- [grunts]

588
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:16,773
[panting]

589
00:30:16,774 --> 00:30:18,316
Everything okay out here?

590
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:19,818
[groans]

591
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:24,532
Don't let him drive.

592
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:26,867
Call an Uber. I'm done.

593
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:29,662
[groans]

594
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:33,207
[grunts] Damn it.

595
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:57,773
[Tutu] Should I heat up your wings
for breakfast?

596
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:00,900
You didn't touch them last night,

597
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:03,487
and that hasn't happened
since Lola swallowed that squeaker.

598
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:06,699
You wanna talk about it?

599
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,368
No, I'm fine. Just busy.

600
00:31:10,244 --> 00:31:12,538
Been hearing a lot of that
from you lately.

601
00:31:14,582 --> 00:31:18,126
[sighs] You keep putting
these walls up around yourself.

602
00:31:18,127 --> 00:31:20,295
You're the one missing the view.

603
00:31:20,296 --> 00:31:24,466
Tutu, I just said goodbye to one shrink.

604
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,122
Ugh, it's not very inviting.

605
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:57,582
I think that's the point.

606
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:59,334
Suspect's furthest from the door.

607
00:31:59,335 --> 00:32:01,085
Detectives between them and the exit.

608
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,880
- [Colleen] Gotcha.
- Mm-hmm.

609
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:06,884
Mm-hmm.

610
00:32:09,303 --> 00:32:11,137
We have a surveillance budget now?

611
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:12,806
Rawls brought his toys.

612
00:32:13,474 --> 00:32:15,392
- [chuckles]
- Nice.

613
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,688
Lucy Duncan's ten minutes away.

614
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:44,004
{\an8}All good!

615
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:51,636
You didn't return my calls.

616
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:52,930
I was busy.

617
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:56,850
I wanted to tell you that you were right.

618
00:32:57,601 --> 00:32:59,143
Charlie Grant's signature was forged.

619
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:01,313
Glad you got the confirmation you needed.

620
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:07,444
Look... [clears throat] ...I know I've
been on you about getting your badge,

621
00:33:07,945 --> 00:33:09,987
but now I completely
understand your hesitation.

622
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:13,325
And whatever you decide to do,
I'll respect it.

623
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:15,577
[clears throat] Um...

624
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:18,621
Lucy Duncan's upstairs. You ready?

625
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:19,707
Yeah.

626
00:33:22,126 --> 00:33:24,836
It wasn't really a relationship.
We just hooked up.

627
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:26,587
[Laffont] Um... [chuckles] Sorry.

628
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:29,090
I've been, uh,
bitten in the rear end by this before.

629
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:31,134
When you say hooked up, you mean...

630
00:33:31,135 --> 00:33:32,552
We slept together.

631
00:33:32,553 --> 00:33:33,762
Mmm.

632
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:36,389
Like, had sex.

633
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:40,102
[breathes deeply] I mean,
I wanna say maybe three times?

634
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:42,019
And the last time was...

635
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,230
The night before the party.

636
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:45,232
The night before he died.

637
00:33:45,983 --> 00:33:47,316
You were at the party?

638
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:48,861
Well, all the Chi-O girls were there.

639
00:33:49,445 --> 00:33:51,446
We always hung out with those guys.

640
00:33:51,447 --> 00:33:54,699
Are you aware of a book they kept
of the girls that they slept with?

641
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,452
Oh, God. The body count book?

642
00:33:57,077 --> 00:33:58,411
It's called the body count book?

643
00:33:58,412 --> 00:34:00,163
Yeah, that's what they called it.

644
00:34:00,164 --> 00:34:02,457
[sighs] And you knew about this?

645
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:04,292
Oh, they tried to keep it this big secret,

646
00:34:04,293 --> 00:34:07,462
but we would hear them talking about it,
especially when they were drunk.

647
00:34:07,463 --> 00:34:09,673
So I went looking for it
the night of that party.

648
00:34:10,716 --> 00:34:12,426
Were you worried that you were in it?

649
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:16,220
Okay.

650
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:19,265
Present-day me recognizes that that
book is horrendous and men are trash,

651
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:22,060
but back then, I wasn't upset.

652
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:26,190
I know, it's crazy, but I was...

653
00:34:27,024 --> 00:34:29,109
well, I was kind of curious
what he wrote about me.

654
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:32,653
And what did he say?

655
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:35,115
Oh, I was one of the lucky ones, I guess.

656
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:38,786
But then it was obvious
that Nick had a girlfriend.

657
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,247
I felt terrible
'cause she lived on my floor.

658
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:44,416
Meredith something.

659
00:34:46,043 --> 00:34:47,794
If I had known... [stammers]

660
00:34:47,795 --> 00:34:51,048
I mean, I was wild, but I was not a bitch.

661
00:34:51,924 --> 00:34:54,342
And he was so awful about her in the book.

662
00:34:54,343 --> 00:34:57,679
Calling her a... a... a stage five clinger.

663
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:01,474
Oh, and there was other stuff too.

664
00:35:01,475 --> 00:35:02,683
Like what?

665
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:05,270
He wrote about her inexperience.

666
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,734
He called her a... a cold fish
and nicknamed her Sushi.

667
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:17,866
Will you find Meredith's page,
open it up for me?

668
00:35:18,534 --> 00:35:21,870
Sure. It's just a few pages before mine.

669
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,387
It should be right here.

670
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:49,397
[Laffont] Have a seat
over there, Miss Haines.

671
00:35:49,398 --> 00:35:50,523
[door closes]

672
00:35:50,524 --> 00:35:51,607
Yeah, right there.

673
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:54,068
Um, I'm so sorry about the makeshift.

674
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:55,653
<i>We're the cold case division.</i>

675
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:57,655
<i>Can I get you a cup of coffee, water,
or anything?</i>

676
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:58,990
- [Meredith] <i>No.</i>
- <i>Soda?</i>

677
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:01,784
- [Meredith] <i>What is this about?</i>
- [Laffont] <i>Um... I'm only a reserve officer...</i>

678
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:02,995
Meredith?

679
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:05,705
[sighs] Gonna be a delicate one.

680
00:36:05,706 --> 00:36:08,375
I think we might have a better shot
with her woman-to-woman.

681
00:36:09,126 --> 00:36:10,627
Why don't you sit in for Laffont?

682
00:36:13,422 --> 00:36:18,634
We weren't together long
but losing Nick derailed me a bit.

683
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:19,761
How so?

684
00:36:21,138 --> 00:36:22,597
I'm alone.

685
00:36:22,598 --> 00:36:27,394
Always just afraid, you know,
of getting close to someone.

686
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:29,563
Losing them.

687
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,358
Now I'm 39 and... [chuckles]

688
00:36:36,153 --> 00:36:39,197
Do you remember anything
strange the night he died?

689
00:36:40,157 --> 00:36:41,825
Just a regular party.

690
00:36:42,326 --> 00:36:44,035
Drinking, dancing.

691
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:45,996
And you and Nick, you were solid?

692
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:49,750
Solid as any college
relationship, I guess.

693
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,586
Can we show you something
that we found in our investigation?

694
00:36:53,587 --> 00:36:54,879
Mm-hmm.

695
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,758
You know, I've seen a lot of awful
things in this job, but this one...

696
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:00,802
this really made me sick.

697
00:37:04,473 --> 00:37:05,474
What?

698
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,350
What is it? [chuckles]

699
00:37:07,351 --> 00:37:09,227
Well, they called it the body count book.

700
00:37:09,937 --> 00:37:10,938
Mmm.

701
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:12,814
Can you take a look?

702
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:28,205
Okay. I don't blame you.

703
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:30,706
Those photos. That language they use.

704
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:33,709
The callous disrespect
for every single woman in here.

705
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,378
- It's disgusting.
- Mmm.

706
00:37:35,379 --> 00:37:39,633
And if I'm being honest,
it's probably the reason why Nick is dead.

707
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:43,678
You know, these guys, they...

708
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:46,555
they do the most unspeakable things
and there's no consequence.

709
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:48,809
Instead we carry it, right?

710
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:52,771
We shoulder all the pain,
we get called names,

711
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:54,982
we get our reputations ruined.

712
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:00,320
Meredith,
I know you had a page in this book.

713
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:02,531
And I know you tore it out.

714
00:38:04,533 --> 00:38:06,617
- I... I didn't.
- [Ballard] I don't blame you.

715
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:09,621
After what he did,
after what he said about you in here.

716
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:12,958
I would've done the same thing.

717
00:38:13,834 --> 00:38:15,002
In fact, I know I would've.

718
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:20,173
But I don't think you've dealt
with what it did to you.

719
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:25,261
I think that you packed it away,
in a really dark place.

720
00:38:25,262 --> 00:38:28,098
And I think you've been stuck
on that balcony ever since.

721
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,993
When I saw that book...

722
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:52,456
saw what he said about me...

723
00:38:57,419 --> 00:38:58,503
I loved him.

724
00:39:01,173 --> 00:39:05,052
He was my first everything.

725
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:10,348
How could he hurt me so bad?

726
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:15,520
I was so stupid.

727
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:18,648
I thought...

728
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:21,026
I thought he would apologize.

729
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:24,446
But he just laughed

730
00:39:25,906 --> 00:39:27,282
in my face.

731
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:31,828
Said I was crazy and desperate.

732
00:39:35,082 --> 00:39:36,416
Maybe he was right.

733
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:43,548
And then he got mad
at me... [breathes shakily]

734
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:47,969
because I ripped that page out
of his precious book.

735
00:39:49,054 --> 00:39:51,306
He said his friends would have his ass.

736
00:39:51,848 --> 00:39:52,849
The brothers.

737
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:58,980
I was there crying in front of him
and he was thinking about the brothers.

738
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:01,274
[sighs]

739
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,738
I just wanted him to hurt
the way that he hurt me.

740
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:12,327
So I hit him.

741
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:17,541
You hit him with what?

742
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:20,669
That thing.

743
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:26,174
I hit him in the head

744
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:29,094
and I could tell that it hurt.

745
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:36,642
[cries] And then he
tried to grab it from me,

746
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:41,021
and I just had
this really weird quick thought that...

747
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:42,106
out of nowhere...

748
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:46,611
that if I just pushed while he pulled,
he would just fall.

749
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:51,575
What did you do?

750
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:57,664
I pushed. [breathing shakily]

751
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:05,338
[sobbing continues]

752
00:41:10,886 --> 00:41:12,012
Oh, God.

753
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:19,436
Sometimes it doesn't even feel like a win.

754
00:41:22,022 --> 00:41:23,647
The books will go to Sex Crimes.

755
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:26,776
Some of these women might get justice
if they choose to pursue.

756
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:28,819
What about Nick's sister?

757
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,405
She's meeting me here soon.

758
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:34,158
Gonna be a bitter pill finding out
her brother was no saint.

759
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:35,701
Yeah.

760
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:37,913
Well, she wasn't wrong
about the fraternity though.

761
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:42,292
All that toxic shit played a part,
just not in the way she thought.

762
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:46,254
Hey, Parker,

763
00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:49,090
remember what I said to you
about your badge.

764
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:52,093
I want you to feel like
you're doing the right thing.

765
00:41:55,931 --> 00:41:57,724
[Parker] <i>I don't really know what to do.</i>

766
00:41:58,683 --> 00:41:59,851
I don't know what to do.

767
00:42:01,186 --> 00:42:03,897
You know, I almost left in '91.

768
00:42:04,648 --> 00:42:07,484
Rodney King. Everything got dark after.

769
00:42:08,068 --> 00:42:09,527
Didn't know who you could trust.

770
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:14,532
The guy in the ride next to you,
he could've had it in him, you know?

771
00:42:15,742 --> 00:42:17,409
Then the riots.

772
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:21,498
Our family suffered,
the whole city suffered.

773
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:28,171
Believe me,
I struggled to find a reason to stay.

774
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:31,758
Then why did you?

775
00:42:32,968 --> 00:42:36,137
When you knew what
your so-called brothers were capable of?

776
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:42,352
Because once you know that,

777
00:42:42,852 --> 00:42:44,813
<i>you have a purpose.</i>

778
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:49,150
<i>Someone has to watch the watchmen.</i>

779
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:15,635
[dog pants]

780
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,013
[chuckles]

781
00:43:18,888 --> 00:43:19,889
Stay.

782
00:43:20,849 --> 00:43:22,058
Good girl.

783
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:27,771
Stop judging, she's a growing girl.

784
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:29,524
Well, I'm not judging her.

785
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:32,735
Subtle.

786
00:43:32,736 --> 00:43:34,154
Making Dad's favorite dinner?

787
00:43:35,864 --> 00:43:38,116
I've wasted 25 years being subtle.

788
00:43:39,451 --> 00:43:41,077
[sighs] You're stuck, Renée.

789
00:43:41,911 --> 00:43:43,245
You have been for awhile.

790
00:43:43,246 --> 00:43:44,748
And maybe that's on me.

791
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,459
I should've talked to you more about him.

792
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:51,755
We all have our reasons
for keeping things to ourselves.

793
00:43:52,881 --> 00:43:54,090
[sighs]

794
00:43:58,136 --> 00:43:59,387
Do you have that photo?

795
00:44:09,939 --> 00:44:11,649
That board was a beauty.

796
00:44:12,442 --> 00:44:14,110
[chuckles] Yeah.

797
00:44:15,278 --> 00:44:16,779
He taught me how to ride on this one.

798
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:18,448
He taught you more than that.

799
00:44:21,326 --> 00:44:22,327
I know.

800
00:44:25,914 --> 00:44:26,915
I love you, Tutu.

801
00:44:30,377 --> 00:44:31,461
Yeah, yeah.

802
00:44:33,046 --> 00:44:35,048
[hopeful music plays]

803
00:45:03,076 --> 00:45:07,038
[soft rock playing in bar]

804
00:45:21,261 --> 00:45:22,762
You a cop?

805
00:45:23,346 --> 00:45:24,430
Sorry, what?

806
00:45:24,431 --> 00:45:25,889
Oh, my bad. Didn't realize you were...

807
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:27,308
No worries. Did you need something?

808
00:45:28,435 --> 00:45:30,686
I don't know if my weak
pickup line was worth all this.

809
00:45:30,687 --> 00:45:32,313
Well, now I wanna hear it.

810
00:45:32,856 --> 00:45:35,649
[chuckles] Uh,
I just asked if you were a cop.

811
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:36,734
Oh.

812
00:45:37,444 --> 00:45:39,529
No, just an intern.

813
00:45:40,405 --> 00:45:42,781
But you should know, I-I don't date cops.

814
00:45:42,782 --> 00:45:45,577
Oof, you wound me.

815
00:45:46,411 --> 00:45:50,874
Well, maybe you don't date cops
'cause you haven't met me yet.

816
00:45:54,878 --> 00:45:57,172
All right. Have a seat.
