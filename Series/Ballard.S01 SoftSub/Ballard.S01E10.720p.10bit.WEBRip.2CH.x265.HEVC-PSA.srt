[Ballard] <i>Previously on</i> Ballard<i>...</i>

2
00:00:01,377 --> 00:00:03,086
So what, you running this thing now?

3
00:00:03,087 --> 00:00:05,171
[Olivas] Keep doing your jobs
and the money will keep flowing.

4
00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:07,298
I'll make sure the cartel knows
it's business as usual.

5
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:09,300
We traced another number
from Driscoll's cell phone.

6
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:11,137
I wanted you to see it for yourself.

7
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:14,306
Wow. Wow. [chuckles]

8
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:16,766
[siren wailing]

9
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:18,935
- LAPD. Olivas, hands up.
- Hey, easy.

10
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:20,478
You got no idea what you've done.

11
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:23,106
[Berchem] <i>I bet it feels good. Knowing
what you've been through with Olivas.</i>

12
00:00:23,107 --> 00:00:26,943
Surprise. You used to love
watching your dad build his boards.

13
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:28,987
[Ballard] <i>He died when I was 14.
Surfing accident.</i>

00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:32,699
<i>Tutu in there thought it would be
cathartic for me to build his board.</i>

15
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,951
[Parker] <i>You know, everything's coming
up Cold Case unit.</i>

16
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:37,996
You can feel it, right? Like
something big's coming around the corner?

17
00:00:37,997 --> 00:00:40,623
[Laffont] November 2000.
Sawtelle. Check it out.

18
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:42,292
Naomi Bennett was assaulted?

19
00:00:42,293 --> 00:00:43,918
- She was a victim.
- A victim who survived.

20
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:45,128
[gasps]

21
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:47,839
[Berchem] <i>This is huge.
She could ID your serial killer.</i>

22
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,425
These men may or may not
have been involved in your attack.

23
00:00:50,426 --> 00:00:52,302
Can you tell me
if you recognize any of 'em?

24
00:00:52,303 --> 00:00:53,803
[Naomi] It's number four.

25
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:55,513
Tom, it's him. Gary Pearlman.

26
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:57,265
The Councilman's dad?

27
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:58,851
We found a living victim.

28
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:00,435
Rawls, where are you?

29
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:03,355
I stopped by Jake's place.
I'm with his dad.

30
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:05,106
- No, Gary!
- [gunshot]

31
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:07,443
[gasps] Rawls?

32
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:12,490
[sirens wailing]

33
00:01:24,168 --> 00:01:26,045
[police officers chattering]

34
00:01:27,338 --> 00:01:28,421
Any sign of the shooter?

35
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:30,632
No, ma'am. Car's in the garage.
Must've left on foot.

36
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:32,467
Lock down this neighborhood.
No one goes in or out.

37
00:01:32,468 --> 00:01:35,012
- We're all over it.
- [chattering on police radio]

38
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:49,025
How bad is it?

39
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:50,902
[paramedic] He's hanging in,
but we've gotta move.

40
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:54,698
No. Oh, no, Rawls. Goddamn it. [sighs]

41
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,451
Where is your car?

42
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:00,037
Where is your car, Rawls?

43
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,252
[Ballard] You hang in there, okay?

44
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:08,879
[chattering on police radio]

45
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,091
Pull up DMV registration for Ted Rawls.

46
00:02:13,092 --> 00:02:15,635
Put out a crime broadcast on his BMW ASAP.

47
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:18,388
Suspect is Gary Pearlman.
He is armed and dangerous.

48
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:19,473
Copy.

49
00:02:20,683 --> 00:02:22,058
[phone rings]

50
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:23,185
[Ballard sighs]

51
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:26,522
- Laffont.
- Um, what's the news?

52
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:30,233
[Ballard] <i>He's hanging in,
but he's lost a lot of blood, Tom.</i>

53
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:32,152
They're putting him
in the ambulance right now.

54
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:34,947
Any sign of Gary?

55
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:37,532
No, but I think he stole Rawls's car.

56
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:40,577
We're putting out a BOLO.
I need you to coordinate with Metro.

57
00:02:40,578 --> 00:02:43,747
Get Naomi somewhere safe until this guy
is in custody. I need her on lockdown.

58
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:48,794
[Pearlman] Hey. Hey. Hey.

59
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:51,171
- I gotta go.
- Is that my dad?

60
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,840
- [Ballard] Jake. Jake.
- Is that my dad? Is he okay?

61
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:55,008
- Stop. Stop.
- What are you doing?

62
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:57,010
- What are you doing here? Where's my dad?
- Stop.

63
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:59,305
Jake, it's not your dad. It's Rawls.

64
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:01,724
What?

65
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:04,935
These murders we've been investigating...

66
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:08,772
they were committed by your father.

67
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:12,902
- What? No. No, that can't... that can't be.
- Yes.

68
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:15,194
It was Gary all along.

69
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,322
No.

70
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,824
He killed Sarah. He killed all of them.

71
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:23,662
- [breathes shakily]
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

72
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:28,083
- No. No.
- [siren wailing]

73
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,595
I want the major case
management system running

74
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:42,347
before the hour's up.
Willis, you're heading it.

75
00:03:42,348 --> 00:03:45,183
Make sure we have canvas teams
pulling video in Pearlman's neighborhood

76
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:47,061
and start interviewing
potential witnesses.

77
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,063
I want Cyber up on...

78
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:55,653
Cooper. Take him to my office.

79
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:01,824
I want Cyber up Gary Pearlman's
bank accounts

80
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:04,035
on his phones,
his email, his social media.

81
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:06,037
And I wanna find Ted Rawls's car.

82
00:04:06,038 --> 00:04:08,414
Right now, that's the best chance
we have of locating Gary.

83
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:11,961
4 Series like that should come
with GPS tracking. I'll get into it.

84
00:04:12,962 --> 00:04:14,671
Coglin, have one of your people
talk to Jake.

85
00:04:14,672 --> 00:04:17,090
Get a list of friends and family
his father might seek out.

86
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:18,466
- Places he might go.
- Copy that.

87
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:20,051
Sir, I'd like to be the one
to talk to him.

88
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:22,470
Captain, no disrespect to the detective...

89
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:23,721
I've built a rapport with him.

90
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:26,683
Sir, my team runs these drills.
We know what we're doing.

91
00:04:26,684 --> 00:04:28,851
And I know these cases,
and I know the people involved.

92
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,854
- If the lieutenant would like to--
- Detective Ballard.

93
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:36,402
Coglin, I want her with Jake.

94
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:39,737
- Yes, sir.
- [Berchem] All right. Let's get to it.

95
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,906
You wanna tell me
what the hell happened with the DNA?

96
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:45,118
You ran Sarah's weeks ago. Why didn't we
get a familial match to the killer?

97
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:48,747
The only thing I can think of is that
Gary is not Sarah's biological father.

98
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:52,083
- You think the wife had an affair?
- She could have.

99
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:55,003
I've got a volunteer working it right now
with Darcy to confirm it.

100
00:04:55,004 --> 00:04:56,879
Make me your first call.

101
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,132
[sighs] Yes, sir.

102
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:00,800
You get Naomi squared away?

103
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:04,887
Yeah. Parker's taking her to a safe house
in Hollywood. She is pretty freaked.

104
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:06,056
I bet she is.

105
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:07,808
- [sighs]
- You busy?

106
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:14,857
After Mom died,
he, um, folded in on himself.

107
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:20,487
And all their friends
were hers anyway. [sniffles]

108
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:26,869
He's got nobody. Except me, I guess.

109
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:30,456
So you can't think of anywhere
he may have gone?

110
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,624
Places he talked about?

111
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:38,005
You know, I found her that night.

112
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,759
Sarah.

113
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,011
[mournful music playing]

114
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:46,388
Got home from a friend's.

115
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:50,350
I thought everyone was gone.
It was so quiet.

116
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:53,270
I went upstairs.

117
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:58,150
Her door was open and...

118
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:02,529
God.

119
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:07,493
He must've heard me pull up
and that's why he went out the window.

120
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:13,081
Wasn't five minutes later

121
00:06:13,082 --> 00:06:16,293
before he came through the front door
like he just got home himself.

122
00:06:17,086 --> 00:06:20,547
[Pearlman sighs]

123
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:25,843
I looked up to him. He came to my games.

124
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:30,182
He helped me with homework.
He gave me advice.

125
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,769
[sighs]

126
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,188
I mean, none of it makes any sense.

127
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:42,569
How can... How can he be this...
this monster at the same time?

128
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:50,827
- [Nelson] Hey.
- Hi.

129
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:52,203
You talk to Jake?

130
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:54,665
He's in rough shape.
It's good that you're here.

131
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,750
Have you heard anything yet?

132
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:00,294
No. I'm on my way to the hospital now.

133
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:01,880
If there's anything I can do...

134
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:03,507
Thank you.

135
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:09,304
- [phone buzzes]
- [sighs]

136
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:11,389
Colleen. How's Rawls?

137
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,518
Uh... [sighs] Last I heard, in surgery.

138
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,769
But I haven't seen the doctor in a while.

139
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,813
Okay, I'm on my way to you.

140
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:21,065
Okay. Hey, listen, I heard from Darcy.

141
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:24,694
That palm print on the windowsill
in Sarah's bedroom,

142
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:26,113
it definitely belongs to Gary.

143
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,030
Jesus.

144
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:31,075
And, uh, Jake
and Sarah don't share paternal DNA.

145
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:33,704
So mom had an affair. What a mess.

146
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,914
What about Gary? Any news on where he is?

147
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:39,001
[Ballard] <i>Not yet. But we'll find him.</i>

148
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:44,672
I just... I can't believe it was him.
He seemed like such a nice man.

149
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:45,757
[elevator dings]

150
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:52,389
I gotta go.
Call me if there's any updates.

151
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:58,102
Lewis is covering this area of quadrants.
He's gonna upload. You two split it.

152
00:07:58,103 --> 00:07:59,645
- Captain.
- Whatever you get,

153
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,772
- let me know immediately.
- Excuse me.

154
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:04,859
I know that the assumption is always
that the suspect is going to run,

155
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,486
but I don't think Gary Pearlman
is going to do that.

156
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,696
Why wouldn't he?

157
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:12,533
You know we found a woman, Naomi Bennett,
that he left for dead back in 2000.

158
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:13,784
So?

159
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:17,039
So based on what I know about him, I don't
believe that he would leave her behind.

160
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:19,248
Sir.

161
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,333
Explain.

162
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:22,084
She's not just a loose end.

163
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:24,378
The guy wants to rabbit.
There is no doubt in my mind.

164
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,088
I agree. He wants to run.

165
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,757
But there's a part of him,

166
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:31,637
the part that killed all those women,
that won't let him do that.

167
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:36,307
The fact that Naomi is still out there
and she's alive means that... she won.

168
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:38,017
I don't think he'll walk away from that.

169

Make sure he knows that somehow.

How do we do that?

173
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,960
- Put me on the news.
- What? Like this isn't already a circus.

174

- Captain, we need to focus our resources...
- Sir, let me tell him

what he's leaving behind.

176
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:11,718
And then maybe, I don't know,
but maybe he will reveal himself.

The diligent work
of the LAPD's Cold Case unit

180
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:05,104
uncovered a mountain of evidence
that Gary Pearlman left behind,

00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,982
including, most recently, a living victim.

They certainly don't do it for the salary.

He thought it was pretty messed up how
you got blindsided in that news interview,

about replacing you.

00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,536

[Gary] You really think you're gonna walk
away from this, Renée?

349
00:24:55,286 --> 00:24:56,370
Huh?

350
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:04,170
We both know how this ends.

351
00:25:07,215 --> 00:25:08,216

[groaning, whimpering]

360
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:03,270
This is Detective Renée Ballard.
Ahmanson Training Center.

361
00:26:03,271 --> 00:26:07,357
Advise responding units code 4,
suspect's in custody.

362
00:26:07,358 --> 00:26:12,113
I need an RA for a male, white,
approximately 70 years old,

363
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:15,448
suffering from a pretty messed-up hand.

364
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:16,659
[groaning continues]

365
00:26:35,386 --> 00:26:39,140
You know, I knew she was one of them
the minute I saw her face.

366
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:46,646
Standing at the counter,
going on and on with the salesgirl.

367
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:52,695
I'm sorry. You said she was one of them.
Who is them?

368
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:56,615
A certain kind of woman.

369
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:03,998
Uppity, selfish, not ladylike.

370
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:09,795
You said she was talking
to the salesperson.

371
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,506
Yeah. At the jewelry store.

372
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:14,967
She had just gotten a promotion,

373
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:20,181
and, uh, she was going to put everything
on hold for this job.

374
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:23,642
Marriage. Kids.

375
00:27:24,769 --> 00:27:29,565
I was doing him a favor, you know?
She wasn't the marrying kind.

376
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:35,237
We'll come back to that.

377
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:43,954
We didn't connect any,
uh, souvenirs to Sarah.

378
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:47,665
I guess you had plenty around the house.

379
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,834
[Laffont] She seemed like a nice girl.

380
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:52,629
Honor roll, cheerleader...
[chuckles] ...theater club.

381
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,673
How did your daughter fit the pattern?

382
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,053
She wasn't my daughter.

383
00:28:00,763 --> 00:28:03,724
But I raised her anyway, like she was.

384
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:07,603
Because I-I believe in family first.

385
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:13,483
And yet she dared
to accuse me of infidelity.

386
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:14,609
That night?

387
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,319
She found some things in my truck

388
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,115
and she thought I was cheating
on her mother.

389
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:23,284
She found your souvenirs. The lipstick.

390
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:26,287
She thought you were having an affair.
She had no idea that--

391
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:28,791
She shouldn't have been looking
through my things.

392
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:31,544
[Bosch] That's enough.

393
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:37,800
He cop to all your victims?

394
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:39,718
The ones we've ID'd, yeah.

395
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:43,264
Laffont's working the other three
unmatched souvenirs we have left.

396
00:28:44,265 --> 00:28:46,099
What about Laura?
He give you anything new?

397
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,895
Only that he killed her because
she wasn't gonna make his coffee anymore.

398
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:51,729
Come again?

399
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:55,151
Laura was a barista at Gary's local spot.

400
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:58,362
She was nice to him. She talked to him.

401
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:01,574
He liked her
until she landed the commercial,

402
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:05,743
and then he said that she,
uh, was no longer humble,

403
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,745
she was bragging about getting the role,

404
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,915
and that she didn't have to
pour coffee anymore.

405
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:15,629
[sighing] Just... He was upset
that she was leaving him behind.

406
00:29:18,841 --> 00:29:21,844
Let me guess.
All goes back to his childhood.

407
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:26,055
Mom left when he was eight,
dad took it out on him pretty severely.

408
00:29:26,056 --> 00:29:27,891
Told him he was the reason.

409
00:29:27,892 --> 00:29:30,311
And the world gains another psychopath.

410
00:29:32,021 --> 00:29:34,523
Looks like he really
did a number on this place.

411
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:40,069
Caught me by surprise. I thought he'd go
after our living victim, Naomi,

412
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:44,950
but I had the psychology right.
Just the wrong target.

413
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:49,413
Probably a good thing
you don't actually think like a killer.

414
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:51,040
[chuckles]

415
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:53,791
Glad you got the bastard though.

416
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:58,547
Even after all those years
of haystack blown over the investigation.

417
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:01,550
Well, the past is always present, right?

418
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:04,260
Renée, let me tell you something.

419
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:07,681
Anyone ever takes me out,
I hope you catch the case.

420
00:30:10,518 --> 00:30:12,645
That's a high compliment, coming from you.

421
00:30:15,189 --> 00:30:19,108
What about your conspiracy case?
Olivas and those other shit-bird cops.

422
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:21,402
Well, it's with the DA's office now.

423
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:23,489
They're keeping me
at arms length, of course.

424
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:26,074
I should know more when I see you next.

425
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:30,621
Ah. Here's everything I got
on Laura's case.

426
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:37,503
It's a long list of casualties
with this guy.

427
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:42,258
Yeah. It is.

428
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:44,593
[knocks on cabinet]

429
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:47,012
Till next time.

430
00:31:18,127 --> 00:31:20,254
[sighs] You got back late last night.

431
00:31:22,715 --> 00:31:25,009
Yeah. I went out with the team.

432
00:31:25,843 --> 00:31:27,428
We needed some time to be together.

433
00:31:28,971 --> 00:31:32,891
It's beautiful.
You gonna finally take it out?

434
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:34,852
How could I not?

435
00:31:37,438 --> 00:31:38,814
He'd be proud of you.

[Bosch] Renée! Renée!

469
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:25,207
- Hey.
- Hey, Harry. What are you doing here?

470
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,669
I reached out to my friend
in the DA's office,

471
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,672
asked about your conspiracy case.

472
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:34,715
Tell me.

473
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:36,927
Goes before the grand jury next week.

474
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:40,347
Charging six officers.

475
00:35:41,223 --> 00:35:44,768
- Six? I gave them seven names.
- I know.

476
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:52,025
They're gonna kick Olivas.
He's gonna walk. Sorry.

477
00:36:02,995 --> 00:36:05,830
So, I want you to be
on that two o'clock call with the mayor--

478
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:09,710
Chandler. Why isn't Robert Olivas
being charged with conspiracy?

479
00:36:11,295 --> 00:36:12,296
Give us a moment.

480
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:14,589
How did you know?

481
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,841
The evidence my team collected
indicated he was higher up

482
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:18,509
than any other officer we gave you.

483
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,846
Then I believe you've answered
your own question.

484
00:36:23,265 --> 00:36:24,600
He made a deal?

485
00:36:25,434 --> 00:36:27,310
With what? What did he offer?

486
00:36:27,311 --> 00:36:30,980
Conspiracy cases always require
an insider who's gonna flip--

487
00:36:30,981 --> 00:36:32,315
We gave you Manny Santos.

488
00:36:32,316 --> 00:36:35,651
Manny is low-level. We needed more.
Olivas raised his hand.

489
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:39,406
Of course he did.
And you had to take the easy way.

490
00:36:40,032 --> 00:36:42,408
I know, given your history
with Detective Olivas,

491
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:43,492
that you might feel--

492
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:44,828
My history?

493
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:50,082
He told us about the issues between you,
which you should've shared from the start.

494
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:53,337
My history has nothing to do with the fact
that he's committed serious crimes.

495
00:36:53,921 --> 00:36:55,755
Detective, you're not seeing
the bigger picture here.

496
00:36:55,756 --> 00:36:58,592
No, I'm seeing it. Pretty damn clear.

497
00:37:03,931 --> 00:37:06,767
Parker, shit's gone sideways
with Olivas. Call me back.

498
00:37:22,783 --> 00:37:24,742
What the hell, Ballard?
What are you doing here?

499
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:29,038
You snake! You don't care who you hurt
or who you leave behind!

500
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:31,666
You always get away with it! Always!

501
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:34,502
Calm down, Ballard. Don't be so upset.

502
00:37:34,503 --> 00:37:37,923
You think the world is fair,
but it's just not.

503
00:37:38,966 --> 00:37:40,550
And it's not my fault either.

504
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:43,595
I just know how
to make the most out of it.

505
00:37:44,096 --> 00:37:48,183
I'm gonna be fine. I'm gonna weather
all of this because I always do.

506
00:37:49,518 --> 00:37:55,439
But you... you're gonna spend the rest
of your career in that basement,

507
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,942
clawing to get out.

508
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:02,280
[scoffs] You know,
I've been where you are.

509
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:06,159

in my direction.

00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:10,956
But what you don't know
is the whispers have already started.

511
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:15,961
You're gonna be toxic in the LAPD.

512
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:18,839
They're gonna wipe your name
from everything.

513
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:26,096
Where's your wife, by the way?

514
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:31,643
She take off already?
Took the boys with her?

515
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:36,148
You've got me to thank for that.
I put her in touch with Berchem.

516
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:37,774
Give me a reason.

517
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,361
[sighs]

518
00:38:42,362 --> 00:38:47,117
My career may be in a basement,
but at least it's not in a fucking box.

519
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:55,542
[items clatter]

520
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,461
[sighs]

521
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:20,692
Who could he possibly have to trade?

522
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:24,404
I don't know.

523
00:39:25,155 --> 00:39:28,407
We'll probably find out in a year or two,
when everything comes to light.

524
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:32,829
But at least he doesn't have
a badge to hide behind.

525
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:42,506
Bet you wish I never knocked on your door.

526
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,383
Nah.

527
00:39:48,178 --> 00:39:49,512
I mean, don't get me wrong,

528
00:39:49,513 --> 00:39:52,516
it kills me that he won't get an ounce
of what he deserves,

529
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:57,395
but... at least I'm not alone in all this.

530
00:40:03,777 --> 00:40:05,862
- [cars approaching]
- [siren blares]

531
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:08,406
[dog barks]

532
00:40:16,832 --> 00:40:18,999
- [Ballard] Can I help you?
- Detective Renée Ballard?

533
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,501
- That's me.
- [phone chimes]

534
00:40:20,502 --> 00:40:22,129
You're under arrest

535
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:25,214
for the murder of Detective Robert Olivas.

536
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:26,550
What?

537
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:30,761
Ballard, somebody shot him. He's dead.

538
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:32,012
[dog barks, growls]

539
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:34,849
[stammers] Uh, can you hold on
just for one second please?

540
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:36,476
- You... You don't need to...
- [handcuffs click]

541
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:43,817
[no audible dialogue]
