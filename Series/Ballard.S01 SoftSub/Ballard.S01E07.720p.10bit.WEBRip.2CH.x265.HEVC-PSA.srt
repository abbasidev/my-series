00:00:01,293 --> 00:00:03,003
[Ballard] <i>Previously on</i> Ballard<i>...</i>

2
00:00:03,796 --> 00:00:05,588
[Berchem] <i>You have 72 hours.</i>

3
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:08,842
Find something meaningful
or this case goes to Homicide.

4
00:00:08,843 --> 00:00:11,554
[Hopkinson] <i>So, serial killer, huh?</i>

5
00:00:12,096 --> 00:00:13,096
<i>You got a name?</i>

6
00:00:13,097 --> 00:00:16,808
{\an8}[Ballard] <i>I found a closed case from 2008.
The victim was strangled in her bed.</i>

7
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:20,145
The family reported
a gold bracelet missing from the scene.

8
00:00:20,146 --> 00:00:21,730
<i>We found that bracelet...</i>

9
00:00:21,731 --> 00:00:24,149
[breathes heavily]
<i>...among our killer's souvenirs.</i>

10
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,943
The victim's boyfriend was convicted,
but he always claimed innocence.

11
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:28,611
If we reopen this case,

12
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:31,740
we might find a link
between the women and the real killer.

13
00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:33,867
And we could
potentially free an innocent man.

14
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:38,455
Mike and Denise were found
within a ten mile radius near Crestline.

15
00:00:38,456 --> 00:00:41,375
So she was the target.
Mike was an obstacle.

16
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:43,710
Luis said that we could trust him.

17
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:45,712
- You should've kept your mouth shut.
- [muffled screams, cries]

18
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:47,088
Always a pleasure.

19
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:48,465
You need a ride?

20
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:49,967
Thanks. I got one.

21
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:53,512
[Ballard] <i>Ibarra was gonna flip
on the cartel, so Driscoll took him out.</i>

22
00:00:54,138 --> 00:00:57,307
Driscoll's either incredibly reckless
or he thinks he can't be touched.

23
00:00:57,308 --> 00:01:00,101
[Driscoll] They got no leads, no suspects.

24
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:02,145
You're young,
maybe you don't know how this works,

25
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:04,356
but they're right outside,
looking for cracks.

26
00:01:05,483 --> 00:01:07,150
<i>Like I said, I'm not a monster.</i>

27
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:10,571
[both grunting]

28
00:01:12,782 --> 00:01:14,866
- I got it.
- [Aaron] <i>Are you sure about this?</i>

29
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:15,950
He's gonna die!

30
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:19,079
[Aaron] <i>Make a vertical incision
a half inch deep to create an opening.</i>

31
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,750
<i>Push the tube into the incision until
you feel it go through the trachea wall.</i>

32
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:25,377
[Ballard breathes heavily]

33
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,088
- [inhales sharply]
- [screams]

34
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:31,299
No!

35
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,385
- [grunting, panting]
- [Lola barking]

36
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:39,183
- [radio chatter]
- [siren wailing]

37
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,233
[detective, distorted]
Did you know this man?

38
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:52,154
Ma'am, look at me.

39
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:01,038
{\an8}Sorry, I'm gonna have to ask you again,
did you know this man?

40
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:05,708
Yeah.

41
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:07,669
[detective] You're gonna have to
speak up now. I can't hear you.

42
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:10,798
Her throat was compressed in the attack.
She'll be hoarse for a while.

43
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:14,426
Yeah, I knew him.

44
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:18,055
Help me out with something.

45
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:22,309
Who pulled out the trache? Him or you?

46
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:25,395
You gonna read me my rights now?

47
00:02:25,396 --> 00:02:29,483
Hey, buddy. An ambulance is waiting.
Let's pick this up tomorrow.

48
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,529
We're gonna need her clothes.

49
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,322
This is not my first rodeo.

50
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,826
You'll get her clothes
once she's changed at the hospital.

51
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:42,288
Come on, let's go.

52
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:04,977
You okay?

53
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:15,821
Everything's gonna be fine.

54
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:21,452
[whispers indistinctly]

55
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,418
[ominous music plays]

56
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:31,921
[ambulance engine starts]

57
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:48,186
Let's go!

58
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:50,356
[siren wailing]

59
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:14,129
[shutter clicks]

60
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,681
Thank you.

61
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,231
[grunts]

62
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:46,869
- What the hell happened?
- News said someone tried to strangle her.

63
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,456
No. It's, uh... [stammers]
...related to the John Doe case.

64
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:51,874
- What?
- How?

65
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,126
[sighs] Uh...

66
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:54,669
[sighs]

67
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,965
Probably hard to know
since it's under Sheriff's jurisdiction.

68
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,261
Right. They're very territorial.

69
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:07,181
[sighs] Can we go see her?

70
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:09,892
I don't think visitors are a good idea.

71
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:12,979
Detective Laffont? Some Detectives
from Homicide are here. They want--

72
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,063
Hey, Tom.

73
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:15,732
- Greg?
- [Parker] What the hell?

74
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:17,359
Sorry to intrude.

75
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:19,987
Okay. Hey.

76
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:24,199
- Whoa, whoa. What's going on?
- [Ted] Hey, hey, hey. What the hell?

77
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:31,664
You didn't have to.

78
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,542
Believe me, it was perfunctory.

79
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:38,630
You look like hell.

80
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:41,925
What happened?

81
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,677
- You know what I know.
- Bullshit.

82
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:48,390
How come you never told me an ex-cop
was a suspect in your John Doe case?

83
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:52,352
I just didn't get a chance.
It all came together so fast.

84
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:55,271
But when I get back to work,
I'm going to--

85
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:58,942
About that,
Homicide is taking the Pearlman case.

86
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:11,412
So those are "I'm sorry" flowers,
not "get well" flowers.

87
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:13,831
They're taking the John Doe case too,

88
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:17,460
but it sounds like that one closed itself
when Driscoll pulled his trache.

89
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:21,048
[inhales sharply] Any more bad news?

90
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:25,468
I'm gonna put a protective detail on you
until we sort all this out.

91
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:26,928
No, no, no.

92
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:28,805
Driscoll's dead. I don't need a detail.

93
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:29,890
It wasn't a question.

94
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,853
Fine. I get to pick the team.

95
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:39,566
Once you're cleared by the doctors,
you can call Metro and make arrangements.

96
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,653
But take a few days.

97
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:49,159
[grunting]

98
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:54,873
Hey.

99
00:06:58,168 --> 00:06:59,627
- Hey, Ballard.
- Hi.

100
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:02,548
Got you staying at the Sand Dollar Motel
until this all blows over.

101
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:04,633
Sounds lovely.

102
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:07,469
Appreciate it.

103
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:32,035
He a friend of yours?

104
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:35,455
One of the few.

105
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:43,922
Okay, room 210.
We'll be here if you need us.

106
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:46,550
Thanks.

107
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:52,847
So, Laffont dropped by my crib last night
sometime after 1:00.

108
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:57,352
He gave me a phone. A dead ex-cop's phone.

109
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,897
Said you wanted me to dump the data.

110
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,691
Did you?

111
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:05,944
Before I answer that,
what the hell is going on?

112
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:07,904
I can explain,

113
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:10,865
but first I gotta figure out how to get
that phone back in the chain of custody.

114
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:12,284
Already took care of it.

115
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:25,004
Working with Mo on a need-to-know basis.

116
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,214
I need to know.

117
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:28,467
I need you to fill me in.

118
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,011
Who's Anthony Driscoll?

119
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:35,390
[sighs] He murdered a John Doe,
one of my cold cases.

120
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:38,476
And then I find out
this guy's running guns and drugs

121
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:41,687
between the Zacatecas Nuevas cartel
and the LAPD.

122
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:42,980
Jesus, Ballard.

123
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:45,149
Yeah. And he must've been in deep

124
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,861
because he chose to pull his trache
rather than get arrested.

125
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:51,822
Doesn't sound like a cartel hit,
the way he came for you.

126
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:53,783
Strangling's not their style.

127
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:54,867
No.

128
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,079
My guess is he was on his own.

129
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,038
[scoffs] If this was a cartel hit,

130
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,041
we wouldn't be sitting here
right now talking.

131
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:03,919
I'm sorry.

132
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,587
I pulled you into some deep waters.

133
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:09,132
Uh... Story of my life.

134
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,384
I did dump Driscoll's phone.

135
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:13,928
Found a bunch of numbers,
probably burners.

136
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:16,973
So we'll have to chase 'em down
the old-fashioned way.

137
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:20,227
Follow the pings, put faces to numbers.

138
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:27,526
And I still cannot believe that
you took a cell phone from a crime scene.

139
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,154
- I was gonna give it back.
- [chuckling] Yeah.

140
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:37,995
Oh, man. I'm beginning to like you
more and more. [laughs]

141
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:40,205
Jesus.

142
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:21,038
[sighs]

143
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,957
[groaning]

144
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,044
[phone ringing]

145
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:37,678
Laffont. [clears throat] What's up?

146
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:40,098
[Laffont] <i>Just checking on you.
How you doing?</i>

147
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:44,644
I'm fine,
it's just my voice is driving me crazy.

148
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:47,147
How's the team holding up?

149
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:48,774
<i>Not well.</i>

150
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:52,194
<i>You give any thought
what you're gonna tell them?</i>

151
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:53,820
[sighs]

152
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,031
Everything.

153
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:58,075
Why didn't you tell us?

154
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:01,328
I shouldn't even be telling you
at this point.

155
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:05,915
Well, at least now we know
who's outside the circle of trust.

156
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,919
No, this is so much bigger than trust.

157
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,462
This puts all of you in danger.

158
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:15,841
They went after Javier Fuentes
the same day Driscoll went after me.

159
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:18,512
And I know
that's not the job you volunteered for.

160
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:23,100
So if any of you want out, I understand.

161
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:36,613
[chuckles] Okay.

162
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:38,490
No more secrets.

163
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:41,284
Circle of trust.

164
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:45,621
Let's get back to work.

165
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,707
[stammers] Get back to work on what?

166
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,544
They took both of our cases.

167
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,380
Right. I don't know that yet.

168
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:56,007
But I'm gonna figure it out.

169
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:07,310

00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:23,994
<i>My son, he was killed.</i>

175
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:27,456
<i>His name is Raehyun. Raehyun Lee.</i>

176
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:31,460
<i>I call the detectives,
but they no longer call me back.</i>

177
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,547
<i>I want my son back.</i>

178
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:40,510
<i>I fear he will never rest in peace
because they never found his body.</i>

179
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:51,605
I found our new case.

180
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:53,982
Who's in?

181
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:58,444
Box was a mess.

182
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:02,323
My guess is the original IO pegged it
as a gang killing and called it a day.

183
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:03,866
Gonna be a heavy lift.

184
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:05,951
Yeah. Are you sure about this?

185
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:09,705
There's no body. Just a pool of blood
in the alley behind Ray's apartment.

186
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:12,167
Maybe you ought to go home.
Rest for a couple days.

187
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:16,004
No, I'd rather work.
I'll go crazy licking my wounds.

188
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,048
Honey, lemon, ginger.
Soothes the vocal cords.

189
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:20,133
[sighs] Thank you.

190
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:26,931
A green Ford Fiesta was spotted
on security footage leaving that alley

191
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:28,516
around the time Ray disappeared.

192
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:31,310
No plates, which seems "gang-y."

193
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:35,105
But the vic's cell pinged once after that
up in La Cañada.

194
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:37,566
Which seems considerably less "gang-y."

195
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:40,612
But it says here that Ray was affiliated
with the Asian Gs.

196
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:42,321
Hmm.

197
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,490
They had Koreatown on lock in 2018.

198
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:47,535
Seven years later, territory's shifted.
Maybe somebody will talk.

199
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:49,119
Mmm. I don't know.

200
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,623
I mean, gangs
in my neighborhood can hold a grudge.

201
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:55,668
And people tend to keep their mouths shut,
even years later.

202
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:56,752
We still have to try.

203
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:58,879
So, Martina, Colleen,

204
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,674
will you draft some flyers
with the car info and the victim's photo?

205
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,634
Push it out on LAPD socials.

206
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:06,679
Rawls, Parker,
will you post those in the neighborhood?

207
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,933
I mean, it's a long shot, but it's one
the original investigator never took.

208
00:14:10,976 --> 00:14:13,061
- Let's go talk to Ray's mom.
- Mm-hmm.

209
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:19,526
Right thing to do,
expanding the circle of trust.

210
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:23,989
But you did leave out the part about Bosch
and the cell phone you swiped.

211
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:28,909
I'm working up to it.
The team needs to focus on this new case.

212
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,704
[grunts] The team needs to?

213
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:33,957
[scoffs] We could use a win right now,
don't you think?

214
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:38,461
But, uh, why this case?

215
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,591
I don't know.
Something in the mother's voice.

216
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:47,304
[sighs]

217
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,266
They never found my father's body either.

218
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,566
Oh, shit, I spaced.

219
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,568
- What's up?
- It's Lancaster prison.

220
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,820
I was supposed to go visit
Jorge Ochoa today.

221
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:08,783
Oh, the guy doing time
for one of our serial killer's murders.

222
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,911
Detective Renée Ballard. [clears throat]

223
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,164
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

224
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:18,376
Can you get me another appointment ASAP?
Thank you.

225
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:21,754
Lancaster hasn't gotten the memo
it's not our case anymore.

226
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:22,839
I guess not.

227
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:25,466
I know he's gone.

228
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:29,804
I just want to bury him, so his soul can
get to where it needs to go.

229
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:36,810
He wanted to play baseball,
even scouts came to watch him play.

230
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:41,190
But then he had an accident
on his friend's motorcycle.

231
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:43,985
They put a metal plate in his shoulder.

232
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:45,654
No more baseball.

233
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:50,450
After that, he had different friends.
Rougher boys.

234
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:54,286
But even God's favorite
was a fallen angel.

235
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,081
Ray, was no angel, Mom.

236
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:58,123
He was in a gang.

237
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,668
Did it to take care of us,
but he was into some bad shit.

238
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:02,379
[speaks Korean]

239
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:05,631
Um, Ray's brother, Jun.

240
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:08,134
I'm sorry,
but if you wanna know the truth, Mom...

241
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:10,302
police need all the facts.

242
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:11,763
He's right, we do.

243
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:14,598
So I read in the case file

244
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:17,518
that Ray got into an argument
with another boy at school

245
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,144
a few days before the shooting.

246
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,940
Marcus Jeong. Yeah.

247
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:24,859
Him and Ray were friends,
till they weren't.

248
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,362
- Do you know what happened?
- [Jun] I was just a kid.

249
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:30,406
Marcus has twin face.

250
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:32,032
Two-faced, Mom.

251
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:34,660
[Lillian]
I told the detective to go look at him,

252
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:37,538
but because Marcus doesn't dress
like a bad man...

253
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:40,791
Marcus wasn't in a gang.
And the cops thought it was a gang thing.

254
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,459
So they moved off Marcus.

255
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,754
And then they pretty much gave up
altogether.

256
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:53,096
Well, we're gonna do everything we can
to find out what happened, okay?

257
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:55,724
[scoffs] Mm-hmm.

258
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:08,819
[speaks indistinctly]

259
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,739
- I think it worked out there pretty well--
- [Ballard] Marcus Jeong?

260
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,408
Detective Ballard, Detective Laffont.

261
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:16,661
We wanted to talk to you about Ray Lee.

262
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:22,709
Yeah, um, Kate, I'm gonna...
I'ma catch up with you. Yeah.

263
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,965
[Marcus] He tried to jump me
into the Asian Gs.

264
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:32,385
He was recruiting me hard,
and I-I felt the pull, you know?

265
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:34,720
But I had people on my side.

266
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:37,307
My mom, my teachers,
the counselor at school.

267
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,226
All trying to keep me
on the straight and narrow.

268
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:43,979
But when Ray got killed, look,
that was a big reality check.

269
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,566
It's just, what can happen
when you're in that life.

270
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:49,193
I got it together quick after that.

271
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:52,197
Can you tell us about the fight you had
with Ray, the week he disappeared?

272
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:55,700
It's become like one of those urban myths,
you know?

273
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:57,951
We just had some static.

274
00:17:57,952 --> 00:17:59,162
About what?

275
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:02,331
He thought I was stringing him along
about joining up,

276
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:04,541
but it got blown way out of proportion.

277
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:07,628
People started talking
like it was this cage match.

278
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:09,838
And then this video started circulating.

279
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,215
Wait, what video?

280
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:13,967
Some kid uploaded cell phone footage
of the fight.

281
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:16,845
My mom had a lawyer friend
get it taken down a couple of weeks later.

282
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:18,681
Didn't want it hurting my prospects.

283
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:21,810
Sure looks like things worked out
for Marcus.

284
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:24,103
Maybe at Ray's expense.

285
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:27,689
Let's see where he was
the day that Ray disappeared

286
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:31,276
and then maybe Colleen can dredge up
that video he was talking about.

287
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,779
Mm-hmm. Hey.

288
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:34,863
I am calling an audible.

289
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:36,532
- You look exhausted.
- Laffont.

290
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:38,242
You're going back to the hotel.

291
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:39,327
[stammers, sighs]

292
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:43,456
Get some rest.

293
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,125
Handcuffs if necessary.

294
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:49,003
[sighs]

295
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:04,394
All right, Burner Boy is back there,
seven o'clock.

296
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:08,272
[Bosch] Another blue-suiter.

297
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:09,898
I don't know him.

298
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:12,610
I'll call in the shop number,
see who signed it out.

299
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:19,158
Man, Ballard and all these cops.

300
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:21,077
What's she gotten into?

301
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:24,038
Some bad shit, brother.

302
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,629
[coughing]

303
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:37,719
[sighs]

304
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:45,685
[sighs, chuckles]

305
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:51,565
[gasps, breathes shakily]

306
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:52,650
Oh, honey.

307
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:54,652
[groans]

308
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,868
I'm okay. I'm okay.

309
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:07,332
- Oh, baby.
- I'm fine.

310
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,548
[phone buzzing]

311
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:20,428
Huh? [pants]

312
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:31,606
[groans, sighs]

313
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:35,442
I thought you told me to get some rest.

314
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:36,526
[Laffont] <i>I did.</i>

315
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:39,821
Uh, but I'm calling early
because we got a lead.

316
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:42,075
A witness replied to the flyer we put out.

317
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:43,575
<i>No way.</i>

318
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:46,286
[chuckles] Way. Surprised me too.

319
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:49,247
He lives up in Montrose,
just west of La Cañada.

320
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,875
That's where
the vic's cell phone pinged last.

321
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:53,460
Rightio.

322
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:55,629
He said he was heading out
on an early hike

323
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:57,965
up Colby Canyon
on the morning in question.

324
00:20:57,966 --> 00:21:00,926
<i>Saw someone coming out of the hills
in jeans and a hoodie,</i>

325
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:04,763
all dirty, wearing work gloves.
He drove away in a green Ford.

326
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:08,517
Okay, but why would somebody remember
all these details seven years later?

327
00:21:08,518 --> 00:21:10,894
I am so glad you asked.

328
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:14,774
I am now going to read his statement,
word for word.

329
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:16,442
Ahem.

330
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:21,530
"I got there and realized
there was no pit toilet at the trailhead.

331
00:21:21,531 --> 00:21:24,825
I just finished my coffee, so...

332
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:27,035
Anyway, I found some bushes.

333
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:30,122
And I'm in the middle
of doing my business...

334
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:32,416
[Laffont, witness]
...when someone came out of nowhere."

335
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:33,834
They came down right through there,

336
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:36,628
and my dog went crazy,
pulling on the leash.

337
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:41,258
I got my pants around my ankles,
so I go ass-over-teakettle into the dirt.

338
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:43,760
Anyway,
when I saw the flyer about the green Ford,

339
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:46,889
it was the first thing I thought of.
It was right over there.

340
00:22:24,594 --> 00:22:26,803
[dogs barking]

341
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:28,347
[officer] Found something!

342
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,529
That's him.

343
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:52,914
[ominous music plays]

344
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:57,835
- [sighs]
- Ballard.

345
00:22:58,628 --> 00:22:59,670
Check it out.

346
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:03,883
[music intensifies]

347
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:14,227
[Lillian praying in Korean]

348
00:23:24,946 --> 00:23:25,947
[in English] Amen.

349
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:27,949
[sobs]

350
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:33,329
Did you find a gun?

351
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,415
Were there prints?

352
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:39,209
Yeah, we're processing the gun now.

353
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,294
In Colby Canyon?

354
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:45,507
Look, Jun, I know you want to help,
but you gotta let us do our jobs.

355
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:47,467
Same thing the cops said seven years ago.

356
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:49,469
Jun, look what she's done.

357
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,888
She helped put your brother to rest.

358
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:56,184
Just 'cause they found the body, Mom,
doesn't mean this is over. [huffs]

359
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:57,520
[footsteps recede]

360
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:14,871
I'm headed to Lancaster in the morning
to go talk with Jorge Ochoa.

361
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,789
[breathes deeply]

362
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,082
Do... Do you think you can--

363
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:22,086
Have Firearms fast track the gun?

364
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,462
I'm on it.

365
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:25,631
[softly] Thank you.

366
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:28,717
[clears throat] Also, uh... uh...

367
00:24:28,718 --> 00:24:31,803
See if Colleen has made any progress
on the video?

368
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:32,972
First thing tomorrow.

369
00:24:37,852 --> 00:24:42,023
You know, I never put it together,

370
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:44,859
what happened to your dad.

371
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:48,112
How it drives you.

372
00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:56,204
You could always stay with us.

373
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:58,538
Leo would love to have you.

374
00:24:58,539 --> 00:24:59,707
- [chuckles]
- And Tutu.

375
00:25:01,042 --> 00:25:02,500
Especially on <i>Bachelor</i> night.

376
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,794
[scoffs, laughs] Aw.

377
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:05,921
[chortles]

378
00:25:05,922 --> 00:25:07,005
And leave all this?

379
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:08,799
[Laffont sighs] Hmm.

380
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,760
Thank you for the offer.

381
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:15,598
But it's... it's not the motel.
It's just not home.

382
00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:17,892
Mm-hmm.

383
00:25:26,776 --> 00:25:27,902
[phone rings]

384
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:30,862
Hey. What's up?

385
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:32,739
You talk to Ochoa yet?

386
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:35,033
[Ballard] <i>No, not yet.
I'm on the Sierra Highway.</i>

387
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:36,785
<i>I'm about 40 minutes out.</i>

388
00:25:36,786 --> 00:25:39,037
Any news on the gun we found
with Ray's body?

389
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:42,749
Uh, Firearms Freddie says it was
registered to a Ms. Christa Fortson.

390
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,126
Any connection to Marcus or Ray?

391
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:46,586
<i>Not according to Ms. Fortson.</i>

392
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:47,963
You spoke to her?

393
00:25:47,964 --> 00:25:53,219
Uh, she has an early shift at Denny's,
so I swung by there and got a short stack.

394
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:57,138
Said she bought a bunch of guns
back in the day

395
00:25:57,139 --> 00:25:59,641
for an ex-boyfriend gang member.

396
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:01,185
- Ah, young love.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

397
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:03,187
He'd dole 'em out to his buddies.

398
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:06,147
Any chance he wants to tell us
which buddies?

399
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:07,399
<i>Not likely.</i>

400
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,733
He's dead.

401
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:11,987
And Ms. Fortson's alibi checks out.

402
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:13,989
Great. Swing and a miss.

403
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,283
Yeah. Talk soon.

404
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:16,784
[groans]

405
00:26:19,996 --> 00:26:22,415
[gate buzzer sounds]

406
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:27,962
Sorry I didn't make it in the other day.

407
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,132
[Ochoa] I'm not going anywhere.

408
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,017
That's Elena's.

409
00:26:42,018 --> 00:26:43,102
Your fiancée?

410
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,771
Are those your initials?

411
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:47,690
Yeah.

412
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:49,774
Where did you get this?

413
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:53,154
In a storage unit that belonged to the
person who actually killed your fiancée.

414
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,323
What do you mean? Who?

415
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,450
I don't know that yet, Jorge.

416
00:26:58,242 --> 00:26:59,660
But I think you're innocent.

417
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,454
I need to hear it from you though.

418
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:05,081
I am. I am. I told my lawyer that.

419
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:07,208
He said the DNA was too hard to explain.

420
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:08,585
He wanted me to take a plea,

421
00:27:08,586 --> 00:27:11,087
but I was never gonna do that
because I wasn't guilty.

422
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:12,548
So you went to trial?

423
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:15,885
The jury didn't believe me.

424
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:18,554
Then I had no more money to fight.

425
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,725
I loved Elena.

426
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:24,810
I'd never hurt her.

427
00:27:27,605 --> 00:27:30,608
She gave me one too, with her initials.

428
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:34,070
It said, "<i>Mi Vida</i>, E.C."

429
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:38,282
They took it when they arrested me.

430
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:42,578
She got promoted at her job,
and she was so proud.

431
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:45,373
But it meant long hours.

432
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:47,917
We'd be apart more.

433
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:54,048
So she bought these with her own money,
so we'd have each other.

434
00:27:54,924 --> 00:27:55,925
Always.

435
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:01,096
Look, I don't know, Ballard.
The DNA's a killer.

436
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:02,430
[Ballard] Well, it's not foolproof.

437
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:05,100
She was Jorge's fiancée.
Of course they slept together.

438
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:06,935
Yeah. Says the woman
with a probable concussion.

439
00:28:06,936 --> 00:28:08,020
[scoffs]

440
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:09,938
[documents rustle]

441
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:12,357
This gold bracelet
belonged to his fiancée.

442
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:14,192
Her name was Elena Cervantes.

443
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:15,569
You know where I found it?

444
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:18,906
In the storage unit
of a serial killer I'm investigating.

445
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:20,907
And why didn't you lead with this?

446
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:23,159
Because I was testing your faith
in me, Damani.

447
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,830
- [chuckles]
- And you failed, by the way.

448
00:28:26,414 --> 00:28:27,415
You in?

449
00:28:28,082 --> 00:28:30,084
[sighs] Yeah, I think I am.

450
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:34,046
Good. This guy really deserves someone
who's gonna dig down.

451
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:36,799
Well, I'll get the shovel.

452
00:28:37,425 --> 00:28:39,384
- How's Javi?
- He's hanging on.

453
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:41,177
You got any idea who came for him?

454
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:42,388
Mmm, not yet.

455
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:44,222
I'm working on it.

456
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:45,516
- I'll be in touch.
- Yeah.

457
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:55,109
[copier clattering]

458
00:28:57,445 --> 00:28:58,903
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey.

459
00:28:58,904 --> 00:28:59,989
Hey.

460
00:29:01,449 --> 00:29:02,783
You got to treat her nice.

461
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:08,456
[copier whirring]

462
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:11,500
Thanks.

463
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:13,836
What's all this?

464
00:29:14,587 --> 00:29:18,339
I've got someone working
on an age progression for Ibarra's kid.

465
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,842
- Gael?
- Yeah.

466
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:21,593
I called Missing Persons,

467
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:24,722
but they're taking too long,
so I went to DCFS myself.

468
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:28,683
You know, asked for every kid
around his age.

469
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:31,145
Figured I'd look for a match. I just, uh...

470
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,274
I didn't realize there'd be so many.

471
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,029
It's really got its hooks in you, huh?

472
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:44,116
Gotcha!

473
00:29:44,742 --> 00:29:46,660
I found it. Marcus's video.

474
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:52,583
His lawyer did a good job burying it,
but I found a snipped daisy chain.

475
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:55,376
- The Internet never forgets.
- [keyboard clicks]

476
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:57,045
- <i>You get back over here.</i>
- [grunts]

477
00:29:57,046 --> 00:29:58,297
[crowd clamoring]

478
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:04,178
[clamoring continues]

479
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:08,265
<i>Back off! Get off of me!</i>

480
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:13,604
[teacher] <i>Marcus. Get out of here. Now!</i>

481
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,231
<i>All right, show's over.</i>

482
00:30:16,232 --> 00:30:17,857
[student] <i>Come on, Mr. Kim. Let 'em fight.</i>

483
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:19,777
Wait, freeze it. I know that name.

484
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:21,529
[mutters, sighs]

485
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:25,114
Nathan Kim. He's a teacher at the school.

486
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:29,118
Original IO interviewed him,
and he said the fight wasn't a big deal.

487
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,912
That it was blown out of proportion.

488
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:32,664
- [Parker scoffs]
- Same thing Marcus said.

489
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:34,541
Why did Mr. Kim play that down?

490
00:30:34,542 --> 00:30:36,877
For his benefit or for Marcus's?

491
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:38,587
Let's find out.

492
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:40,673
Stay on Gael.

493
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,591
Let's go, Rawls.

494
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:47,388
[Ted] How long do you think
Berchem's gonna keep this detail on you?

495
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:50,349
[Ballard] Until he decides
I'm not in danger at home.

496
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:56,647
[sighs]

497
00:30:57,648 --> 00:30:59,607
You know, I could upgrade your protection.

498
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:02,068
Put some of my private sector guys
on your house.

499
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:04,404
Ex-Green Beret. They worked the Oscars.

500
00:31:04,405 --> 00:31:06,406
Sounds a little fancy for me, no?

501
00:31:06,407 --> 00:31:08,283
It'd be free of charge, of course.

502
00:31:08,284 --> 00:31:11,286
That is within our budget.
Can I think about it?

503
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:12,537
Sure.

504
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:14,290
Hey, hang on. Laffont is texting.

505
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:19,794
Apparently, Marcus was at a swim meet in
Bakersfield the day that Ray disappeared.

506
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:22,380
He broke the record
for the 50-meter freestyle.

507
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:24,007
Great. So he's not our guy.

508
00:31:24,008 --> 00:31:26,552
Doesn't look like it.
Let's go talk to Mr. Kim.

509
00:31:29,263 --> 00:31:32,099
- [crowd clamoring on video]
- [Mr. Kim] <i>Get out of here. Now!</i>

510
00:31:33,267 --> 00:31:34,475
[clapping] <i>All right, show's over!</i>

511
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:35,561
[video ends]

512
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:40,356
Pretty heated in this video, Mr. Kim.

513
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:44,445
And rough with Ray, considering
he was one of your former students.

514
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:47,239
I know. It's not a good look.

515
00:31:48,449 --> 00:31:51,577
This gang thing, it... gets to me.

516
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:53,578
I grew up in this neighborhood.

517
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:57,540
Used to ride my bike all over,
never once locked it up.

518
00:31:57,541 --> 00:32:00,961
And at some point, things changed.

519
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:03,504
[sighs]

520
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:07,300
All the work I do in the classroom,
it goes down the drain

521
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:11,888
the second these gangs start promising
them quick money and some street cred.

522
00:32:11,889 --> 00:32:14,057
Is that what was happening with Marcus?

523
00:32:14,058 --> 00:32:16,185
He had so much promise.

524
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:20,314
But I could just see him
at this fork in the road.

525
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:24,734
I mean, look at Ray. He was exactly
where Marcus was just a few years before.

526
00:32:24,735 --> 00:32:28,322
And I lost that fight with him.

527
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:31,115
And he ended up dead.

528
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:33,869
You think Ray died
because of his gang affiliation?

529
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:37,331
I know he did.

530
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,250
He had a long list of enemies
by the time he died.

531
00:32:41,335 --> 00:32:43,087
You remember who was on that list?

532
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:45,380
Seven years ago. [sighs]

533
00:32:45,381 --> 00:32:47,925
Man, I talked to the detective back then.

534
00:32:48,926 --> 00:32:51,011
There was a kid named Ashton Reed.

535
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:54,931
Eddy Fortson was another one.

536
00:32:54,932 --> 00:32:56,307
Victor Cabrera.

537
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:57,476
Did you say Fortson?

538
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:00,186
Yeah. He was a student in my class.

539
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:01,772
Any relation to Christa?

540
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:06,859
That was his sister. Why?

541
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,945
[scoffs]

542
00:33:10,781 --> 00:33:13,825
Gun that killed Ray
was registered to Christa Fortson.

543
00:33:13,826 --> 00:33:15,076
Well, didn't she have an alibi?

544
00:33:15,077 --> 00:33:17,871
Yeah, she did.
Which makes her brother our best bet.

545
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:30,842
Hey, if this ain't about
the child support, then what is it?

546
00:33:30,843 --> 00:33:31,927
Murder, Eddy.

547
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:35,680
[stammering] Oh. Uh... I mean...

548
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:36,764
[Ballard] Ray Lee.

549
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:40,977
He was shot multiple times
with a gun registered to your sister.

550
00:33:40,978 --> 00:33:42,812
And we know you had beef with him too.

551
00:33:42,813 --> 00:33:44,439
Ray who? I-- I don't know a Ray.

552
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,484
Well, you went to school together, Eddy.

553
00:33:48,152 --> 00:33:50,027
I went to school with lots of people.

554
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,113
[Ted] You were both on the baseball team.

555
00:33:52,114 --> 00:33:53,907
You rode together to away games.

556
00:33:55,743 --> 00:33:58,829
Your sister told us
about the guns she bought.

557
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:01,874
She buy one for you too?

558
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,085
We're processing that gun
right now for prints.

559
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:09,630
We find yours, Eddy, you'll be
paying child support from prison.

560
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:11,341
[chuckles]

561
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,052
Yeah.

562
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:16,138
Christa gave me that gun.

563
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:19,224
But it wasn't because
I wanted to kill no one, okay?

564
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:23,228
I was getting messed with at school.

565
00:34:24,313 --> 00:34:25,605
You mean bullied?

566
00:34:25,606 --> 00:34:27,690
Christa told me I could use it,
flash it around,

567
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:29,443
get the upperclassmen to ease off me.

568
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:33,572
But it wasn't a week
before someone stole it from my locker.

569
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:35,616
Sister was pretty bent.

570
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:38,118
You've been to Colby Canyon?

571
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:40,620
Colby Canyon? No, what's that?

572
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:42,122
A hiking trail, up the 2.

573
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:44,040
That place.

574
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:47,127
Never been. No, no.
Only the four-point-whatever's got to go.

575
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:49,713
- What do you mean?
- From my school.

576
00:34:50,214 --> 00:34:52,340
One of the teachers took all
the smart kids once a year

577
00:34:52,341 --> 00:34:55,218
for bonding, trust falls,
all that kind of shit.

578
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:56,345
What teacher?

579
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:58,847
I don't know. What's his name? Mr., um...

580
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,184
Mr. Kim.

581
00:35:03,477 --> 00:35:04,520
Yeah.

582
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:06,522
I never made the cut.

583
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:08,815
[Ted] Gotta go back and talk to him again.

584
00:35:08,816 --> 00:35:10,066
[Parker] About what?

585
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:12,152
All we have is a hunch
and the word of a former student.

586
00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:13,737
We're gonna need more.

587
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:17,031
Yeah. Well, we're not
gonna get anything this late.

588
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:20,035
So, first thing in the morning,
we start from scratch on Nathan Kim.

589
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:23,372
Good night.

590
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:27,583
Hey, Rawls.

591
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:32,004
If that offer for security still stands,
I'll take it.

592
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:34,091
Oh. Yeah.

593
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:36,050
Consider it done.

594
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:38,512
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

595
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:51,774
Appreciate you.

596
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:56,488
Hey. Wanted to get this all cleaned up
before you got here.

597
00:35:58,574 --> 00:36:00,117
[sighs] Thank you.

598
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:07,331
I see you upgraded your protection detail.
Pretty impressive.

599
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:09,126
I got some help from a friend.

600
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:11,419
- Is Tutu home yet?
- [phone buzzing]

601
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,504
Outside with Lola.

602
00:36:17,301 --> 00:36:18,509
Hey, Colleen. What's up?

603
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,052
[Colleen] <i>You know I can't help myself.</i>

604
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:24,223
So... [chuckles] ...I did some digging
into Nathan Kim's vehicular history.

605
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:28,269
Turns out, his mom owned a green
Ford Fiesta at the time of Ray's murder.

606
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:29,354
No way.

607
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:31,230
Do we know where it is now?

608
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:33,941
Donated to charity
after she passed in 2021.

609
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:36,111
<i>I'll call tomorrow morning
as soon as they open.</i>

610
00:36:36,737 --> 00:36:38,487
If we can find the new owner,

611
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:40,573
maybe there's some
physical evidence left behind.

612
00:36:40,574 --> 00:36:44,535
Yeah, it's a big if and a big maybe,
but it's worth a shot.

613
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:45,746
Nice find, Colleen.

614
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,540
<i>Now put your laptop away.</i>

615
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:50,667
Copy that.

616
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,091
[gasps] Hi, baby girl.

617
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:01,261
Aw. [grunts]

618
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:04,806
- Ah! [grunting]
- Oh, sorry. Here.

619
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:09,393
Uh...

620
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:12,522
[sighs, pants]

621
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:14,691
Thank you.

622
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,612
- [grunts, sucks teeth]
- Here, here, here, here, here. Come here.

623
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:23,992
Are you ever gonna tell me
about that tattoo?

624
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:26,578
[sighs] Yeah.

625
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:31,208
After my dad died, I was alone.

626
00:37:32,209 --> 00:37:34,711
My mom was already long gone.
[inhales sharply]

627
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:40,217
I fell in with some... some people, and it...

628
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:42,844
[sighs] Anyway, it wasn't good.

629
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:44,805
I was really messed up.

630
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:47,640
[clears throat] So I got this.

631
00:37:47,641 --> 00:37:53,188
You know, I figured even if I was lost,
that maybe he could watch over me.

632
00:37:53,814 --> 00:37:54,815
I love that.

633
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:06,326
Oh, gosh. [grunting]

634
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,623
You've been so good to me.

635
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:14,543
It's easy to be good to you.

636
00:38:20,382 --> 00:38:21,967
These last few days...

637
00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:28,640
something's kinda snuck up on me
in all the chaos.

638
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:35,897
When you called that night,
realizing you were in trouble,

639
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:38,942
it made me think...

640
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:46,158
[chuckles]

641
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,328
Hmm.

642
00:39:07,054 --> 00:39:08,138
[phone buzzing]

643
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:10,765
- [phone beeps]
- I'm on my way in.

644
00:39:10,766 --> 00:39:13,392
Get ready to love me.

645
00:39:13,393 --> 00:39:14,477
Uh, okay.

646
00:39:14,478 --> 00:39:16,104
We found the donated Ford.

647
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:21,025
And with the current owner's consent,
FSD is processing it as we speak.

648
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:22,151
No shit?

649
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:25,404
And we hit the jackpot,

650
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:28,783
'cause nobody ever wiped the GPS data
off the nav.

651
00:39:28,784 --> 00:39:31,535
Guess where Nathan Kim was
the night Ray died.

652
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:32,828
Colby Canyon?

653
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:34,289
You love me, right?

654
00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:38,250
- Hang on. I got another call.
- [phone beeps]

655
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:40,544
- Detective Renée Ballard.
- [Lillian] <i>Jun is gone!</i>

656
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:44,256
<i>He said one of his teachers
killed Ray. Mr. Kim.</i>

657
00:39:44,257 --> 00:39:46,008
<i>I don't know what he's gonna do.</i>

658
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:47,260
All right, I'm headed there.

659
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,013
- [siren wailing]
- [engine revving]

660
00:39:58,188 --> 00:39:59,647
[police chattering on radio]

661
00:39:59,648 --> 00:40:01,273
[Laffont] Black-and-whites got here first.

662
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:04,944
They saw a young, Asian male
barricaded inside.

663
00:40:04,945 --> 00:40:07,238
- They called SWAT.
- Shit.

664
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:08,948
[sighs] We gotta move.

665
00:40:08,949 --> 00:40:12,702
Rawls, you're coming with me.
Laffont, Parker, watch the back.

666
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:30,512
[doorknob rattles]

667
00:40:31,263 --> 00:40:32,430
Rawls, get a crowbar.

668
00:40:33,807 --> 00:40:35,641
- Jun?
- [Jun] Go away!

669
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:37,978
- [Mr. Kim] Please, do something!
- [Jun] Shut up!

670
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:39,770
{\an8}Jun, it's Detective Ballard.

671
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:41,021
{\an8}- [Mr. Kim] Do something.
- Shut up!

672
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:43,691
Jun, put down the gun and walk
towards the door. We got this guy.

673
00:40:43,692 --> 00:40:46,236
He killed Ray, and nobody did anything.

674
00:40:47,237 --> 00:40:50,364
Colby Canyon.
That's where you take the smart kids.

675
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:52,658
Same place you buried my brother!

676
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:54,785
[stuttering]
I don't know what you're talking about.

677
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:56,705
Bullshit! You're lying.

678
00:40:57,289 --> 00:40:58,581
{\an8}Tell him what you did, Nathan.

679
00:40:58,582 --> 00:41:00,624
You're crazy. I didn't do anything.

680
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,543
{\an8}We have the evidence. We have your car.

681
00:41:02,544 --> 00:41:04,254
You don't have time.

682
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:09,216
[shrieks] Okay, okay.

683
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:12,970
I didn't want to hurt anyone. I-- I just
went there that night to scare him.

684
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:15,931
- You took a gun!
- Guns are all he understood.

685
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:17,933
I didn't go there to kill him.

686
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:20,936
But think about it,
how many kids did I save?

687
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:22,146
- Shut up.
- [Ballard] Jun?

688
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:23,898
We have everything we need, Jun.

689
00:41:23,899 --> 00:41:25,734
All right? I told you I wouldn't quit.

690
00:41:26,443 --> 00:41:29,820
Put the gun down, all right?
Let us come in there, do our jobs.

691
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:31,072
We got him.

692
00:41:31,698 --> 00:41:32,782
Put the gun down.

693
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:41,291
Come on. Help us.

694
00:41:44,794 --> 00:41:46,838
- [sobs]
- Put it down.

695
00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:48,548
[gun clatters]

696
00:41:53,637 --> 00:41:56,181
Jun, come to me.
Come to me, come to me. Turn around.

697
00:41:56,806 --> 00:41:58,308
On the ground. On your knees.

698
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:01,937
[handcuffs clicking]

699
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:03,437
- [Mr. Kim yelps]
- No!

700
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:04,647
[both grunt]

701
00:42:04,648 --> 00:42:06,523
[Ted] Don't move! Don't move.

702
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,108
- Stay where you are.
- [officer shouts]

703
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:11,654
- I got him, I got him, I got him.
- [Ted] Come on! Hands behind your back!

704
00:42:11,655 --> 00:42:13,155
[groans]

705
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:15,867
- [Mr. Kim whimpers]
- I'm sorry.

706
00:42:16,618 --> 00:42:18,119
[panting] I know.

707
00:42:22,499 --> 00:42:23,999
Spoke to the DA.

708
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,836
I explained to her about Jun,
and she's gonna push for a low term.

709
00:42:27,671 --> 00:42:28,672
His poor mother.

710
00:42:29,256 --> 00:42:31,048
Well, at least she has answers now.

711
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:32,300
Sucks it took so long.

712
00:42:33,093 --> 00:42:36,303
Well, that's because the original
investigator was looking for a bad guy

713
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:37,721
that looked like a bad guy.

714
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:39,641
Sometimes they just look like us.

715
00:42:40,976 --> 00:42:44,228
What do you say, you put this one
on the shelf too? The Ibarra case.

716
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:45,730
Definitely as good as closed.

717
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:49,693
Oh, um, one sec.

718
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,659
Um, a little more work to do.

719
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,457
You wanna put it up?
You went through hell with this one.

720
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:07,669
No. That's your case.

721
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:21,850
[phone buzzing]

722
00:43:22,684 --> 00:43:23,685
Hey, Harry.

723
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:34,903
They traced another number
from Driscoll's cell phone.

724
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:36,948
I wanted you to see it for yourself.

725
00:43:49,002 --> 00:43:51,171
- Kids, where are you going?
- Hey, hey, slowly, slowly.

726
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,132
You gotta be fucking kidding me.
