1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:01,668
[Ballard] <i>Previously on</i> Ballard...

2
00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:04,254
Bosch's guy pulled 14
numbers off of Driscoll's phone.

3
00:00:04,255 --> 00:00:06,756
All burners. We traced one of them
directly to Olivas last night.

4
00:00:06,757 --> 00:00:08,591
[Ballard] <i>Number ends in 0666.</i>

5
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:09,676
[Martina] <i>Manny Santos.</i>

6
00:00:09,677 --> 00:00:12,178
<i>My boyfriend.
He was getting texts from Olivas.</i>

7
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,514
Manny Santos? Hey!

8
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:15,599
No!

9
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:17,767
[Ballard] You're burned, Manny.

10
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:19,936
You're just the only one
who knows it right now.

11
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:21,396
Don't you wanna keep it that way?

12
00:00:21,397 --> 00:00:23,148
My name is Officer Emmanuel Santos.

13
00:00:23,149 --> 00:00:25,358
I'm cooperating of my own volition.

14
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,818
<i>I was a part of group of cops</i>

15
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:31,573
<i>across the LAPD that colluded
with the Zacatecas Nuevas cartel.</i>

16
00:00:31,574 --> 00:00:33,743
You don't call me, Manny. I call you.

17
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:36,495
- What do you want?
- [Ballard] <i>I just wanted to see your face.</i>

18
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,623
[officer]
LAPD. Put your hands on your head.

19
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:42,792
[Abril] <i>Does the cartel has my son?</i>

20
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:45,545
We are going to keep looking for him.

21
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:49,007
You said that there was
a video of Luis with Gael.

22
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:52,510
I narrowed it down to seven kids
who could be a match for Gael Ibarra.

23
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:56,306
These are the addresses where
each one first entered the system,

24
00:00:56,307 --> 00:01:00,393
but this one was surrendered at
a firehouse six blocks from the Sunbeam.

25
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,896
[Ballard] The connection between
these victims is behavior.

26
00:01:02,897 --> 00:01:07,776
What if our killer was punishing these
women for stepping out of their place?

27
00:01:07,777 --> 00:01:08,860
It's lipstick.

28
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:11,488
It was found under
Sarah's bed like she dropped it there.

29
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:15,117
That's not Sarah's. That's Othella.
It's a brand for Black women.

30
00:01:16,452 --> 00:01:18,953
There was no analysis
done on the lipstick inside.

31
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:20,581
If it wasn't Sarah's, then whose was it?

32
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,340
Results on the lipstick?

33
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:32,967
Yep. You were right.
Lipstick wasn't Sarah's.

34
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:35,220
Original IO only swabbed the outside.

35
00:01:35,221 --> 00:01:39,934
{\an8}Darcy tested the actual lipstick.
Got a sample, and a hit in CoDIS.

36
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:42,310
Hell yes.

37
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:45,815
DNA matched a woman named Naomi Bennett.
In the system for a 2003 felony.

38
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:59,077
Naomi Bennett. Arrested in 2003
for a hot prowl in Sacramento.

39
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:01,663
- Hot prowl?
- A burglary with an occupant inside.

40
00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:05,000
Naomi broke into the home of a woman.
Twenty-six years old.

41
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:07,293
Living alone,
asleep in her bed at the time.

42
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,003
Sounds like one of our victims.

43
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:10,922
What if our killer wasn't a solo act?

44
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:14,092
Hmm. You think this Naomi
person may be working with him?

45
00:02:14,093 --> 00:02:16,177
- Could be.
- Female accomplice?

46
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:17,638
It's not that uncommon actually.

47
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:23,185
Gerald and Charlene Gallego, Myra Hindley
and Ian Brady, the Ken and Barbie killers.

48
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:25,103
Okay, Reddit.

49
00:02:25,104 --> 00:02:28,147
- [grunts]
- All right. Deep dive on Naomi.

50
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,943
Every database we got,
forwards and backwards from '03.

51
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:32,444
Get creative.

52
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:42,829
Flag on the play. The serial killer's
accomplice theory doesn't hold.

53
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:46,041
November 2000. Sawtelle. Check it out.

54
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:56,760
- Naomi Bennett was assaulted?
- Strangled in her home. Left for dead.

55
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:01,056
November 2000.

56
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:04,517
That was five months
before Sarah Pearlman's murder.

57
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,854
Naomi Bennett wasn't an accomplice.

58
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:12,693
She was a victim.

59
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:24,204
A victim who survived.

60
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:28,334
[gasps, cries]

61
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:40,053
This is huge.
She could ID your serial killer.

62
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:42,889
That's what we're hoping.
Thing is, she's in Madera.

63
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,684
- Madera?
- It's a cow town. Central Valley.

64
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:47,393
I did check.

65
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,270
The department plane is available.

66
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:51,105
That's not happening.

67
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:54,360
Just get Madera PD
to set up a virtual interview.

68
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:57,654
You want me to re-traumatize
an assault victim on Zoom?

69
00:03:57,655 --> 00:04:00,324
And then try to extract
25-year-old details from her?

70
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:02,952
Good point.

71
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,037
Have a nice drive.

72
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:09,625
Right. [sighs]

73
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:14,171
On the corruption case, DA's office
wants written statements from your team.

74
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,548
Are you hearing anything else from them?

75
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:18,467
Case is strong.

76
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:21,428
Indictments should be
coming in the next week or two.

77
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:24,098
I bet it feels good.

78
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,557
Knowing what you've
been through with Olivas.

79
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:28,811
But Renée, he's well liked.

80
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:32,606
So, just keep your head down.

81
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:34,358
Copy that.

82
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:37,026
<i>Hey, Parker. Pack a bag.</i>

83
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:39,071
Meet me at the Ahmanson. We leave in 45.

84
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:53,252
Whoa. Renée Ballard.

85
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,797
J. Edgar. It's been a while. You good?

86
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:58,882
Trying to be.

87
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:02,261
Heard you're breaking
the Sarah Pearlman case open.

88
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:03,929
Turned a cold murder hot?

89
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:07,056
- Heard from who?
- Mutual friend.

90
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:09,601
[chuckles] I'm glad, Ballard.

91
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:13,981
- I'm glad you landed on your feet.
- Mmm. Jury's still out. [scoffs]

92
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,735
I don't know. I'm hearing rumblings.

93
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:21,071
Y-You close this big one,
they might bump you back to Homicide.

94
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:25,992
[chuckles] How many department
rumors turn out to be true? Come on.

95
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:27,744
Well, this one has legs.

96
00:05:27,745 --> 00:05:30,079
I'm crossing my fingers
'cause I could use a new partner.

97
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,289
Yeah? Who they got you with?

98
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:34,375
They got me with Tomlinson,
and I kid you not,

99
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:35,918
this guy spends all day checking bitcoin.

100
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,128
[both chuckle]

101
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:38,422
Stay out of trouble, Renée.

102
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,676
[inhales deeply, sighs]

103
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,937
I cannot believe you got
Berchem to approve the plane.

104
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:56,857
- Well...
- Well?

105
00:05:57,608 --> 00:06:00,109
He didn't. Hope you like a road trip.

106
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,527
- I guess.
- [phone buzzes]

107
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:04,322
- As long as you let me DJ. [chuckles]
- [chuckles]

108
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:07,658
- What? News on the corruption case?
- No. It's Laffont.

109
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:10,203
He just got approval to go see Gael
and collect his DNA.

110
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:12,748
We might actually
reunite this kid with his mom.

111
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:16,459
[scoffs] You know, everything
is coming up Cold Case unit.

112
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:20,005
Look, I know we took some bad
beats, but you can feel it, right?

113
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:22,006
Like something big's
coming around the corner?

114
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,592
You sound like Colleen.

115
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,679
[chuckles]

116
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:29,973
Okay, sounds good. Will do.

117
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:32,433
That was Ballard.

118
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:35,353
She said that the DA's office is
requesting written statements

119
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:38,397
on the Manny Santos case,
so while we wait for her and Parker...

120
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:42,026
- Written statements?
- Letters make words. Left to right.

121
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:43,319
[scoffs] Can you put that thing down?

122
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,239
No, I mean, statements about what exactly?

123
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,658
- Well, let's ask the expert. Detective.
- [Laffont grunts]

124
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:50,326
The DA's office
wants statements about the--

125
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:51,410
Oh, uh, I heard.

126
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:55,456
Um, detail your actions
during the investigation. Be specific.

127
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:59,293
Stick to your own POV.
It'll be different for each of you.

128
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:01,421
[scoffs] Homework.

129
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,007
You okay with that?

130
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:06,135
Uh, yeah.

131
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:08,971
[clicks tongue]
I think I'm gonna enjoy this.

132
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:12,849
- Especially the ending.
- Just stick to the facts.

133
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,059
And if you need any help...

134
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:20,898
[sighs]

135
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:23,819
- Hey. Everything okay?
- Yeah.

136
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:25,903
I got Gael's DNA.

137
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:28,240
Oh, that-that's a good thing. Isn't it?

138
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,493
Yeah, Darcy's gonna run it,
but it's just the foster home.

139
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:35,580
I mean, it's a caring place,
but they're under-resourced.

140
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:40,042
Even when, uh, the system is working,
it's not working well enough.

141
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:43,881
[clicks tongue, sighs] It's a shame.

142
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:01,857
[sighs] God, I hate this part.

143
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,032
Ms. Bennett? I'm Detective Renée Ballard.

144
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:12,241
This is Officer Parker.

145
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:15,204
We're with the LAPD.
We'd like to ask you some questions.

146
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,955
About?

147
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,458
November 2000.

148
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:23,461
[sighs]

149
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:25,255
All of them are dead...

150
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:31,761
And-And I'm-I'm the only one.

151
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:32,888
I know.

152
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:34,932
It's a lot to process.

153
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:37,558
[inhales shakily]

154
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:42,022
That was decades ago and I could
barely remember any details back then.

155
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:45,274
The detectives,
they would ask me questions,

156
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:51,073
but it's like my mind didn't want
me to remember. [inhales sharply]

157
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:55,244
I-I don't know how to explain it.

158
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,746
I understand.

159
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,457
I do.

160
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,877
But the smallest detail could help us.

161
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:06,713
We'd like to show you some things.

162
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:09,007
See if they spark your memory.

163
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,885
[grunts, sighs]

164
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,637
I don't know. [sighs]

165
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:17,557
Actually, you know, why don't we, um...

166
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,977
Why don't we give you the night?

167
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:22,813
And we can speak to you in the morning.

168
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:24,648
Okay?

169
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:27,234
Yeah.

170
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:29,444
You had a feeling?

171
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:31,613
Now who sounds more like Colleen?

172
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:34,198
I know.

173
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,785
But I could tell
that she was boxing us out.

174
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:39,996
[sighs] Sometimes you only get one shot.

175
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:41,707
[Ballard] Yeah, but it can take time.

176
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,334
You know. You've been through it.

177
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:46,628
[sighs]

178
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:49,881
I still can't believe we got him.

179
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:51,800
[sighs]

180
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,344
- [clears throat]
- Oh, boy.

181
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:59,265
Well, I don't know what
business brings ladies like you

182
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:02,685
to this fair part of the country,
but God bless capitalism.

183
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:05,229
- [both chuckle]
- [chuckles] Work trip, am I right?

184
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,441
- You sure are, cowboy.
- I knew it.

185
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:09,192
Let me buy you a round.

186
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,111
Uh, we're still in the middle
of this one actually.

187
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:15,282
Oh, come on. All work and no play?
Is that it?

188
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:19,952
- Let's have some fun. [laughs]
- [laughs] Oh.

189
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,872
Oh, don't you worry.
I got a permit for it.

190
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:26,751
- Ah.
- And, uh, I know how to handle it.

191
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:27,835
[chuckles]

192
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:31,464
- Fastest hands in the west, I bet.
- Like Billy the goddamn Kid.

193
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:32,923
[chuckling]

194
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:35,343
So, how about it?

195
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:37,762
Yeah, we're just finishing up
our wings and...

196
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:40,140
Tired of tipping back beers? Hmm?

197
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,893
Well, what if I could get
my hands on something to, uh... [sniffs]

198
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:45,729
...light up the night a little bit?

199
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:48,732
- Catch my drift?
- [chuckles]

200
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,192
- I think we do.
- Yeah?

201
00:10:51,193 --> 00:10:53,361
- Mm-hmm.
- [chuckles]

202
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:56,614
- Oh. Um...
- You know what?

203
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:57,948
I got a permit for mine too.

204
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:59,867
- Right. [chuckles] I, uh...
- Go on now.

205
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,077
- Just gonna... Okay.
- Get.

206
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:02,496
[Ballard laughing]

207
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,415
[sighs] Sometimes it's just too fun.

208
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,793
[sighs]

209
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,880
I don't wanna move too fast with Naomi.

210
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,548
She's got that assault buried so deep,

211
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:17,009
we could lose our chance
if we don't tread carefully.

212
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,095
I don't know.

213
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:20,263
What if we do the opposite?

214
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,015
[knock on door]

215
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:25,893
- Good morning, Ms. Bennett.
- Good morning.

216
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:27,770
Look, I'm-I'm so sorry.

217
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:30,606
I-I stayed up all night racking my brain,

218
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:35,277
and I really wanna help you,
but there's nothing to tell.

219
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,948
- I've moved on. Thank you.
- Naomi.

220
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:43,412
[sighs] Look, hear me out.
I know this is hard.

221
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,163
But the reality is we need you to do this

222
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:49,709
for all the women that he's hurt,
and all the women that he could hurt.

223
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:52,170
[inhales sharply]

224
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,173
It's not that I don't want to.

225
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:59,385
I just can't.

226
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:01,388
Yeah, because you're too far from it.

227
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:04,516
It's like you said,
your mind won't let you.

228
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,477
Maybe that'll change if you go all in.

229
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,355
Come back to LA with us.

230
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:13,524
Wait? Come back to LA?

231
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:18,780
Maybe if you go back and you
immerse yourself, it's a way to remember.

232
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:21,450
[breathes deeply]

233
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:23,160
[sighs]

234
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:39,842
[inhales sharply, sighs]

235
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:41,219
[breathes shakily] Wait.

236
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:43,972
Is that...

237
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:45,599
That's how we found you.

238
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,268
Wow.

239
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:52,522
[sniffles, sighs]

240
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:04,743
[sighs]

241
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:12,209
Everything fell apart for that girl.
[inhales sharply]

242
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:14,085
Can you tell us more?

243
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,265
Um...

244
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:29,476
[sniffles]

245
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:39,027
Um, after what happened, I, um,
I just left, you know?

246
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,780
I thought getting away would help.

247
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,448
I started drinking.

248
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:47,661
And then, I couldn't drink enough.

249
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,666
The first time I tried coke,
I was like, "Thank God."

250
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:57,087
But eventually
that wasn't enough either, so...

251
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:58,588
[sniffles]

252
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,843
After that, um, I got arrested.

253
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,680
The burglary in '03?

254
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:11,351
I tried to break into
my friend's house, and, ugh...

255
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:17,232
that was my rock bottom.

256
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:21,695
That was the end of
a nosedive that all started with him.

257
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:26,407
[inhales sharply]
Things were good before that.

258
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:29,285
So, it's like,
I look at this girl and I just...

259
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:31,288
It just crushes me, you know?

260
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:40,338
[swallows] When you say "good"?

261
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:44,551
[inhales deeply] I was happy.

262
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,305
I had my own place.

263
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:52,766
I'd been grinding through beauty school...
[sniffles] ...for years,

264
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,436
and paying my own way.

265
00:14:56,021 --> 00:15:01,150
And then I finally,
finally got a chair in a salon.

266
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:02,277
And I was like...

267
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:04,279
Man.

268
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:07,157
I mean, I skipped to work every day.

269
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,411
It might not seem like much, but...

270
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,418
But it was everything to me.

271
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:24,966
[sniffles, sighs]

272
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:32,306
Two months before Naomi was attacked,
she landed a chair at Jolie in Mar Vista.

273
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:33,557
That sounds familiar.

274
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:36,644
Like Elena's promotion,
or Laura Wilson's commercial gig.

275
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:39,188
But for that to motivate
our guy to go after Naomi,

276
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:41,399
- he'd have to know about it.
- Exactly.

277
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:46,279
So look for anyone with proximity.
Friends, family, employees at the salon.

278
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,366
Uh, employees at
the Jolie strip mall. Anyone.

279
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:52,243
Councilman Pearlman.

280
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:53,953
Everything all right?

281
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,331
Things are turning nasty,
with the election coming up.

282
00:15:57,332 --> 00:16:00,042
My opponent... [sighs]
...wants to make my connection

283
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:02,837
to the Cold Case unit a central
campaign point against me.

284
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:06,715
- Guys, I am working as fast as I can.
- And we recognize that.

285
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:07,883
But we have another ask.

286
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:11,595
I'm setting up an interview with KTLA
to get in front of the narrative.

287
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:13,056
- And we want you to--
- No.

288
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:15,849
We want you to join Jake on camera.

289
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,560
Hell no. You came here to talk politics?

290
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:20,604
- I-I have a million--
- We wanted to meet in person.

291
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:22,523
- Talk it out.
- Bullshit.

292
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:24,441
You knew that if you called me,
I'd hang up on you.

293
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:27,737
Okay, just t-try to think
big picture here, Ballard.

294
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:30,989
It's not just Councilman's
political career that's on the line.

295
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,367
It's his influence.

296
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,293
What's this?

297
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:47,006
Everything about my relationship
with Manny. Right up to his arrest.

298
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,299
And why are you giving it to me?

299
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,803
Make sure it's thorough. Professional.

300
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:54,179
I don't want anything to screw this up.

301
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,265
Oh.

302
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:57,266
I'm sure Laffont probably--

303
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:59,436
Laffont's too nice to be honest.

304
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:02,272
You lack the tact to be polite.

305
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:04,983
Okay then.

306
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,110
- Hey, Ballard.
- [Ballard] Hey.

307
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:10,612
- I found, uh, something.
- [phone buzzing]

308
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,990
Back in 2000, there was a hot wings spot

309
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:15,492
at the Jolie mall,
right next to the salon.

310
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:18,078
Had an employee named Casey Robbins.

311
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,749
- Casey Robbins have a record?
- Oh, no. Something more than that.

312
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:25,127
[inhales sharply] In 2000,
Casey Robbins lived in Palms

313
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:27,296
on Jasmine Avenue, just north of Venice.

314
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:29,340
One of the same blocks
that another victim,

315
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:33,343
Josie Culver,
canvassed for Hillary Clinton.

316
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:36,722
Josie Culver knocked
on Casey Robbins's door.

317
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:39,225
He has a connection to two of our victims?

318
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:41,811
- That's something, all right.
- I told ya.

319
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:44,230
Can you get a photo of him from 2000?

320
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,651
[sighs]

321
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:54,741
[sighs] Naomi, I know it's been a long
time, but do you recognize this man?

322
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:03,500
[breathing shakily]

323
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,085
Um, I'm not sure.

324
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:12,341
[stammers] I still can't picture his face,
but I'm trying.

325
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:13,717
Don't worry about it.

326
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:16,054
- It's okay.
- Thank you.

327
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:21,309
Where's Casey right now?

328
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:25,271
I couldn't find a current on him.
But found his mom. Woodland Hills.

329
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,731
All right.
Rawls and I will go check it out.

330
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:30,651
You guys cross reference every victim
with this guy Robbins, all right?

331
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:31,736
This is our angle.

332
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:34,447
Rawls.

333
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,122
[scoffs]

334
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:45,457
What?

335
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,877
The shit women have to
deal with is messed up.

336
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:51,798
[sighs] I just...
I read Martina's statement.

337
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,677
And... [stammers]
...everything that happened to Naomi.

338
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:58,262
I mean, all-all these cases.

339
00:18:58,263 --> 00:19:01,224
Yeah. It's not ideal.

340
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,979
And you're expected to date
under these circumstances. I mean...

341
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,731
Honestly, what's that like?

342
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:13,820
I mean,
I guess it's like getting on the 405.

343
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:17,489
The traffic sucks,
but you still gotta get across town.

344
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:21,368
[chuckling]

345
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:22,495
What about you?

346
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,621
D-Dating wise.

347
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:26,540
Oh, you mean my foundation?

348
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:27,625
What?

349
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:31,086
Oh. Ted Rawls's Foundation
for Hungry Single Women.

350
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:34,256
It's our mission to feed
any hungry single woman

351
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:35,883
at LA's finest establishments,

352
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:41,054
drinks included, for four dates,
give or take, until we amicably part ways.

353
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:42,432
Jesus, Ted.

354
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:45,977
[chuckles, sighs]

355
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,688
I mean, I date. I...

356
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:52,233
I haven't been
in a relationship in forever.

357
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:56,946
Psych 101 probably says
that you can't have my dad

358
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:00,867
and come away with
a winning approach to love.

359
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:04,537
I don't know.
Maybe I'm part of the problem.

360
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:09,416
Well, at least you're rich.

361
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:12,377
[both chuckle]

362
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:13,463
Yeah.

363
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:21,554
Yeah, I could believe
a serial killer grew up here.

364
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:24,097
[scoffs] Yeah.

365
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:25,433
Only one car.

366
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:28,311
- Why don't you check out back?
- Uh-huh.

367
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,828
- Hi.
- You're here about the dog then?

368
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:49,207
- The dog?
- You're a little early.

369
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,002
Don't just stand there.

370
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:04,180
[sighs]

371
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:09,602
[gasps] You're a cop.

372
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:12,230
I love <i>Law & Order</i>.

373
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:18,485
"You have the right
to remain silent." [chuckles]

374
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:22,198
You know, after the apocalypse,

375
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:27,787
all that will be left
are cockroaches and cop shows.

376
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:32,417
And that will be just fine by me.

377
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:39,423
You live alone?

378
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:42,510
Oh, I did, till my son moved back in.

379
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:44,178
Casey.

380
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:47,098
He's a real mama's boy.

381
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:53,312
[Ballard] Is your son here right now?

382
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:56,190
[stammers] No?

383
00:21:57,108 --> 00:22:00,111
No. He stepped out.

384
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:06,409
Do you mind if I use your restroom?

385
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:09,286
I just had too much coffee on the way in.

386
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:11,038
Uh... [stammers] ...sure.

387
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:15,417
Sure, if you're brave enough.
You go right ahead.

388
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:16,586
Thanks.

389
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,063
[knocking on door]

390
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:37,190
[Casey's mom] You okay?

391
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,776
Hope you didn't fall in.

392
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:43,904
"Right to remain silent." Oh.

393
00:22:43,905 --> 00:22:45,072
- [sighs]
- Well, come on now.

394
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:47,283
Let's get what you came for.

395
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:52,580
Uh, actually,
I just realized that I need--

396
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:57,417
[Casey] Mama?

397
00:22:57,418 --> 00:22:58,920
Oh, dear.

398
00:23:00,505 --> 00:23:02,964
There you are, sweetie. Hi.

399
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:04,050
Who the hell is this?

400
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:08,262
- She's the woman about the dog.
- That woman canceled.

401
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:10,138
Who the hell are you?

402
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:11,599
She's a cop.

403
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:15,435
- Got a badge and everything.
- Yeah. I think I should get out of here.

404
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:17,020
That's a good idea.

405
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:18,855
"Anything you say can
and will be used against you."

406
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:19,941
Step aside.

407
00:23:23,778 --> 00:23:24,862
Step aside!

408
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:27,572
- Step--
- Everything good in here?

409
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:28,699
[Ballard] Rawls.

410
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:30,952
Do you want to get the car started?

411
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:38,125
Get animal services over here,
and call SIS.

412
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:39,960
That creep doesn't go
anywhere without a shadow.

413
00:23:39,961 --> 00:23:42,754
Looked like a horror show in there.
Think he'll consent to a search?

414
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:43,840
He doesn't have to.

415
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:48,928
- I already got his DNA.
- Oh. [chuckles]

416
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:12,827
- Hey, now. [chuckles]
- [Ballard] Hey.

417
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:15,537
Tutu? Wow. I mean, it's...

418
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:16,746
It's 9:30.

419
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:19,541
A perfectly respectable time for mimosas.

420
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:20,792
[chuckles]

421
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,837
This new lead sounds like
a cause for celebration.

422
00:24:25,423 --> 00:24:28,801
Maybe. Under normal circumstances.

423
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:34,390
And how would one
describe current circumstances?

424
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,893
Well, if I solve this serial case,

425
00:24:37,894 --> 00:24:40,521
there could be a move
back to Homicide in my future.

426
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:43,441
And that's not a good thing?

427
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:46,235
[stammers, sighs]

428
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,487
You like where you are.

429
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:53,784
[sighs] You know, I think I might.

430
00:24:56,204 --> 00:24:58,789
Even more reason to celebrate.
I'll get the glasses.

431
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:01,751
- [chuckles]
- [phone buzzes]

432
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:08,007
Goddamn it.

433
00:25:09,634 --> 00:25:10,801
[sighs]

434
00:25:12,762 --> 00:25:15,222
- Hey, what's up?
- [Ballard] <i>Hey, Parker. Casey's a bust.</i>

435
00:25:15,223 --> 00:25:18,601
The toothbrush sample didn't match
the DNA we got from the palm print.

436
00:25:19,227 --> 00:25:20,227
No.

437
00:25:20,228 --> 00:25:22,480
[groans] <i>I know we were
supposed to take a morning off,</i>

438
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,898
but I need you to get Naomi
into a black and white.

439
00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:26,359
It's time for her to go see the apartment.

440
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:29,736
- You sure she's ready for that?
- I mean, she has to be.

441
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:31,321
[stammers] Okay. We'll meet you there.

442
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:33,448
<i>Frack! You know what? I can't.</i>

443
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:37,410
I gotta go meet Pearlman and Hastings
to prep for this stupid interview.

444
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:38,536
[sighs] You know what?

445
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:41,082
- You go. Take Laffont.
- You got it.

446
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:48,421
- No notes. Great job.
- Really?

447
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:49,590
[Ted] Actually, one note.

448
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:53,219
That guy was an asshole.

449
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:58,224
Uh... Uh, wait. Two notes.

450
00:26:00,268 --> 00:26:02,687
You know you deserve
better than that, right?

451
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:07,400
Okay. Good.

452
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,323
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

453
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:16,575
- [sighs]
- How'd you sleep?

454
00:26:17,285 --> 00:26:19,160
[sighs] I'm not sure that I did. Uh...

455
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:24,000
[grunts] Well, unit's currently empty,
so we can take all the time we need.

456
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,501
Okay.

457
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,842
- [breathing heavily]
- The memories are there.

458
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:36,304
Just let them surface.

459
00:26:37,388 --> 00:26:38,597
[breathing heavily]

460
00:26:39,724 --> 00:26:40,933
It's weird.

461
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:43,436
Smells the same.

462
00:26:45,563 --> 00:26:49,567
[inhales deeply, exhales deeply]

463
00:26:52,153 --> 00:26:54,405
I'd only been here a few months.

464
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:57,449
My first place by myself.

465
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:01,037
[inhales deeply, sighs]

466
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:08,252
Uh... That night, I, uh...

467
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:14,258
I had drinks after work with
a few friends from the salon, and...

468
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:19,805
and then I came home, not too late.

469
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:24,142
Do you remember anything being off
when you got home?

470
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:26,187
[sighs]

471
00:27:30,024 --> 00:27:31,108
No.

472
00:27:34,028 --> 00:27:35,571
[floor creaks]

473
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:41,451
That creak.

474
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:45,372
[stammers, breathes shakily]

475
00:27:45,373 --> 00:27:47,290
I used to step over that creak.

476
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:48,917
[breathes shakily]

477
00:27:48,918 --> 00:27:52,462
But that night, I heard it and I knew
somebody was in the apartment.

478
00:27:52,463 --> 00:27:56,425
- [breathing shakily]
- [floor creaking]

479
00:28:01,389 --> 00:28:03,890
Where were you? When you heard it?

480
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:07,937
[breathing shakily, stammers]

481
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:10,438
I was...

482
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:11,899
I was asleep.

483
00:28:13,401 --> 00:28:14,443
In bed.

484
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:16,444
There.

485
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:19,781
[breathing shakily]

486
00:28:19,782 --> 00:28:21,367
There was a dresser on that wall.

487
00:28:23,661 --> 00:28:26,122
Used to be... [stammers] ...a fan there.

488
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:33,504
What's that sound? It was after, uh...

489
00:28:34,255 --> 00:28:36,132
Was it after? [gasps]

490
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:41,178
[gasping]

491
00:28:43,097 --> 00:28:46,225
I remember when he was...

492
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:50,479
[breathes shakily]
There were people outside.

493
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:54,692
They were laughing.

494
00:28:55,985 --> 00:28:57,736
[sniffles] His, uh...

495
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:00,864
[cries] His eyes.

496
00:29:00,865 --> 00:29:03,659
[breathes shakily] I remember his eyes.

497
00:29:05,161 --> 00:29:06,286
They were brown.

498
00:29:06,287 --> 00:29:07,620
You're sure?

499
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:09,123
[breathes shakily] I'm positive.

500
00:29:09,707 --> 00:29:10,748
Um...

501
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,835
[breathes shakily] Oh, God.

502
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:15,421
I can almost see his face.

503
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:19,508
[cries] And then it fades away.

504
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:24,888
[breathing shakily]

505
00:29:24,889 --> 00:29:27,641
- Shit. Okay.
- Okay, okay. Don't worry.

506
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:31,395
Don't force it, okay?
This was really good, Naomi.

507
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:38,777
I just need a minute. [breathes shakily]

508
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:42,114
- Okay.
- I just... [breathes shakily]

509
00:29:47,578 --> 00:29:48,579
Progress.

510
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:50,539
A little.

511
00:29:51,165 --> 00:29:52,166
Just...

512
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:55,377
- I just hope it was worth it.
- Oh, she'll get there.

513
00:29:56,212 --> 00:29:57,421
She's doing good.

514
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:03,636
I'll call Ballard, ask her to put in
a request for a sketch artist.

515
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:11,476
There are over 6,000
unsolved murders in this city.

516
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:13,728
Many of them involving
victims with families

517
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:15,647
who don't have the power to pull strings.

518
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:18,609
As the son of a blue-collar mom and dad,
I know what that's like.

519
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:22,570
And now with this unit,
I'm using my position

520
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:25,991
to fight like hell for all those
families waiting for answers.

521
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:29,202
But Councilman, what do you
have to say to those critics who say

522
00:30:29,203 --> 00:30:32,747
you are funneling money into
solving your sister's murder,

523
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:37,210
while the city's crime and homelessness
problems spin out of control?

524
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:39,712
I'd say those critics
are misguided-- [stammers]

525
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:41,172
Councilman?

526
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:43,759
- May I?
- Please.

527
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:46,052
Cher, you mentioned funneling money.

528
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:47,679
[chuckles]

529
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:51,141
The Cold Case unit
has one full salaried employee. Me.

530
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:56,396
The rest of my team are volunteers.
We work in the basement of this building.

531
00:30:56,397 --> 00:30:58,398
And yet we're still getting results.

532
00:30:58,399 --> 00:30:59,983
Just last week, we closed a case.

533
00:30:59,984 --> 00:31:01,484
Murder of a 19-year-old boy.

534
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:04,405
We arrested a killer who was
walking the streets for seven years.

535
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,782
Well, that's impressive,
but if Detective Ballard

536
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:12,662
{\an8}<i>is actually clearing cases like she says,
then why is it that your office</i>

537
00:31:12,663 --> 00:31:16,250
is in discussions with the police
commission about replacing her?

538
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:22,714
Well, I'm not sure where
you're getting your information,

539
00:31:22,715 --> 00:31:26,676
but whenever we play with taxpayer money,

540
00:31:26,677 --> 00:31:28,803
it's always important
to constantly reassess.

541
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:30,597
- <i>Even if changes aren't necessary...</i>
- What the hell?

542
00:31:30,598 --> 00:31:31,848
First time hearing about it.

543
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:34,183
<i>...just to ensure that resources
are properly allocated.</i>

544
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:36,561
It was due diligence after the attack
at your house.

545
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:38,480
- That's all. A contingency plan.
- Then why didn't you say that?

546
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:43,611
There were also some concern about
the other case you were building.

547
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,030
- Against Robert Olivas.
- What?

548
00:31:47,031 --> 00:31:49,949
It was suggested that there might
have been some personal motivation.

549
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,034
- Oh.
- We should've back channeled.

550
00:31:51,035 --> 00:31:52,160
This was a mistake.

551
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:54,330
Oh, on that, I wholeheartedly agree.

552
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:04,340
Oh, gosh.

553
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:07,133
- [Ballard] Hey.
- Oh, hey. [clears throat]

554
00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:10,303
- Please tell me you bought beer.
- I did, but, um...

555
00:32:10,304 --> 00:32:13,057
- I... I told him he could come in.
- What?

556
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:15,851
But...

557
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:20,856
[sighs]

558
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:33,993
Hey.

559
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:35,079
Hi.

560
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:39,916
Sorry to swing by.
I wanted to talk to you in person.

561
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:41,001
Okay.

562
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:43,879
Um...

563
00:32:47,758 --> 00:32:48,759
We...

564
00:32:49,843 --> 00:32:51,261
We started this casually.

565
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:53,889
That was the agreement.

566
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:56,684
And it was good.

567
00:32:58,268 --> 00:32:59,853
It was great. [chuckles]

568
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:08,153
But when you were attacked, and I was on
the other end of that call with you, I...

569
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,823
[stammers] It was awful.

570
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:15,536
I mean, it...
I was worried about you, obviously, but...

571
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:18,872
it was more than that.

572
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:21,542
And I realized...

573
00:33:23,711 --> 00:33:25,504
I want something more.

574
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,966
[sighs]

575
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:33,679
I... [sighs]

576
00:33:35,264 --> 00:33:36,514
I don't know what to say.

577
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,350
No, you don't have to say anything.

578
00:33:39,101 --> 00:33:43,772
Because I know you can't give
something more right now anyway.

579
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:49,153
[sighs]

580
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:56,535
I can't let myself be a casualty here.

581
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:01,707
I'm sorry, Renée.

582
00:34:30,486 --> 00:34:31,904
You're quiet this morning.

583
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,072
More than usual.

584
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:35,657
Everything good?

585
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,201
Brown eyes.

586
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:41,120
That's all we got so far.
She didn't give you anything else.

587
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:42,456
Okay, but she will.

588
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,082
Or she might.

589
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:48,085
You know, she was with
the sketch artist all morning.

590
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,587
Maybe there was some progress made.

591
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:51,840
We're putting her
through all of this again.

592
00:34:52,883 --> 00:34:56,511
How much damage is worth doing to her?
If we don't even get what we need.

593
00:34:56,512 --> 00:34:57,595
Come on.

594
00:34:57,596 --> 00:35:00,431
You know sometimes it just takes
one thing to blow open a case.

595
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:01,599
Just one tiny thing.

596
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,144
And you know
that sometimes that thing never comes.

597
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,856
[radio chatter]

598
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:10,024
[Naomi] Good morning.

599
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:11,692
- Good morning.
- Morning.

600
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:13,444
- [sighs]
- How are you doing?

601
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:14,695
[groans] I'm fine.

602
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:18,366
But, uh, why're we here if the assault
happened in my apartment?

603
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:19,743
Because we're struggling, Naomi.

604
00:35:20,244 --> 00:35:21,370
Ballard.

605
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:27,960
It's true that, uh, the picture we showed
you of Casey Robbins, that was a miss.

606
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:32,214
And we ran the list of employees
at the strip mall three times.

607
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:37,052
Nothing. So... [sighs] ...maybe being
back here will spark something.

608
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,887
Can you tell me which one the salon was?

609
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:44,309
[sighs] Um, my chair was by that window.

610
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:49,480
Do you remember any male clients
that stood out to you?

611
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:51,566
Jolie only serviced women.

612
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:54,902
Any coffee shops
or restaurants nearby that you'd go to?

613
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:58,406
I used to bring my own food.
[breathes shakily]

614
00:35:58,407 --> 00:36:01,158
What are the chances of you
actually finding this guy?

615
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,912
I mean, if I can't remember.

616
00:36:04,413 --> 00:36:05,455
Is there some other way?

617
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:08,792
[Parker] We're figuring it out, okay?
Don't get discouraged.

618
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:11,545
Why didn't she park in the lot?

619
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,880
That employee.

620
00:36:13,881 --> 00:36:15,298
She didn't park in the lot.

621
00:36:15,299 --> 00:36:19,343
Um, when I worked here,
the company that owned the mall

622
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:21,929
didn't allow employees to park out front.

623
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:26,351
So we had to park around the corner,
up a side street.

624
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:28,437
Can you show us where?

625
00:36:29,271 --> 00:36:31,522
Let's find out who lived here
back in 2000.

626
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:34,484
If Naomi was parking here, she could
have been spotted on the way to work.

627
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,241
You know that building?

628
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:44,494
It was under construction back then.

629
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:54,421
Parker. Listen, I-- Naomi, thank you.

630
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:03,638
All right, guys, we're expanding our
search to the 1400 block of Ashland.

631
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:06,682
Naomi parked off-site, so there's a chance
she encountered our killer there.

632
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:09,602
All right. I'll look into ownership
records, divvy them up with Martina.

633
00:37:09,603 --> 00:37:12,229
Okay. Hey, where's Rawls?

634
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,398
- Isn't he supposed to be here?
- He called.

635
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:16,442
Uh, said he had something
to do on his way in.

636
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:18,069
All right, well,
fold him in when he gets here.

637
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,529
- Laffont.
- Mm-hmm.

638
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,491
Naomi didn't recognize her attacker,

639
00:37:23,492 --> 00:37:25,952
which means
he was on the periphery of her life.

640
00:37:25,953 --> 00:37:28,162
Someone she never noticed,
but who noticed her.

641
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:30,873
Yeah. There was a real estate office
on the corner.

642
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:32,792
It was renovated in 2000.

643
00:37:32,793 --> 00:37:36,630
I spoke to the owner and he said he was
gonna send me a list of sub-contractors.

644
00:37:37,506 --> 00:37:39,757
Oh, he already did. Great.

645
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:42,469
I'm gonna forward this to you,
so that you can have a lo...

646
00:37:45,305 --> 00:37:46,306
No.

647
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,350
No way.

648
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:50,894
What?

649
00:37:56,525 --> 00:37:58,944
No fucking way. That, uh...

650
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:02,280
That's gotta be a coincidence, right?

651
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:10,038
Naomi, these men may or may not
have been involved in your attack.

652
00:38:10,664 --> 00:38:13,041
But can you tell me
if you recognize any of 'em?

653
00:38:13,709 --> 00:38:14,793
[sighs]

654
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,170
Okay. [breathes shakily]

655
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:19,256
All right.

656
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:25,429
[breathing shakily]

657
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:33,854
It's number four.

658
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:39,609
Definitely. Oh, my God.
[stammers] Oh, my God.

659
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:41,819
Naomi, are you sure?

660
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,113
[inhales heavily]

661
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:47,992
- Okay?
- Yeah.

662
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:50,495
[breathes shakily]

663
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:52,414
So?

664
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:56,418
Tom, it's him.

665
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,421
Who?

666
00:39:01,048 --> 00:39:02,174
Gary Pearlman.

667
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:05,676
What?

668
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:06,845
The Councilman's dad?

669
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:11,390
Oh, my God.

670
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:14,227
Pearlman Electric was one of the subs
on the Landmark Realty build-out.

671
00:39:16,313 --> 00:39:18,815
Gary watched her walk
to her new job every day.

672
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:20,692
To her new life.

673
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:22,777
[sighs]

674
00:39:22,778 --> 00:39:24,154
She was on top of the world.

675
00:39:25,155 --> 00:39:26,405
And he couldn't have that.

676
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:30,618
Why didn't anyone flag
a connection in the DNA?

677
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:31,953
There wasn't one.

678
00:39:32,788 --> 00:39:34,706
I reviewed the results with Darcy myself.

679
00:39:35,457 --> 00:39:37,209
We need Gary's DNA. Where's...

680
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:39,919
Where's Rawls?

681
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,506
I mean, she ruffles feathers. I get it.

682
00:39:43,507 --> 00:39:46,968
But replacing her would be
a colossal mistake, and Jake...

683
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:49,262
He-He needs to know that.

684
00:39:50,806 --> 00:39:54,101
[sighs] I'm sorry.
He said he'd be about 20 minutes.

685
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:57,104
- You don't mind me waiting here for him?
- [Gary] No, not at all.

686
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:01,817
You've really, uh,
changed your tune on her, haven't you?

687
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:06,403
Can I assume she's making headway
in Sarah's case?

688
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,988
Oh, yeah.

689
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:09,199
We found a living victim.

690
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:12,410
Can you believe that?

691
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:15,747
- You're... You're kidding.
- No.

692
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:18,208
No, killer left her for dead in 2000.

693
00:40:21,962 --> 00:40:23,088
Wow.

694
00:40:25,841 --> 00:40:29,344
So, uh, what has she told you?

695
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:33,514
I mean, did she ID the son of a bitch?

696
00:40:33,515 --> 00:40:36,642
No, but it's been a lot of years,
you know?

697
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:39,855
A lotta... lotta trauma to wade through.

698
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:42,648
Yeah.

699
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:44,651
But Ballard, you know,
she doesn't waste an opportunity.

700
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:47,821
Speaking of...

701
00:40:48,864 --> 00:40:51,031
- Yo, boss. What's up?
- [Ballard] <i>Hey, Rawls.</i>

702
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:53,952
Listen, I know this is gonna
sound crazy, but it's true.

703
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:57,998
Naomi just ID'd Gary Pearlman.
He's our killer.

704
00:40:58,999 --> 00:41:00,542
- What?
- [Ballard] <i>Yeah.</i>

705
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:03,127
<i>We need you back here. Now.</i>

706
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:04,212
Uh...

707
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:07,007
Yeah. Yeah, I can work on that for you.

708
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:10,843
- Rawls, where are you?
- <i>Uh, I...</i>

709
00:41:10,844 --> 00:41:12,888
I stopped by Jake's place.

710
00:41:15,182 --> 00:41:16,224
I'm with his dad.

711
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,020
Um...

712
00:41:21,021 --> 00:41:22,563
But I'll be back at the office soon.

713
00:41:22,564 --> 00:41:23,690
<i>It's all good.</i>

714
00:41:25,609 --> 00:41:27,067
- No, Gary! Wait! Don't--
- [gun fires]

715
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:29,653
[gasps] Rawls?

716
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:33,617
[pants] Oh, my God. [sighs]
