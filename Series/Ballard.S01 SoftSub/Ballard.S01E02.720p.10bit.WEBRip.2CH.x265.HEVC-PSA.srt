00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:01,836
[Ballard] <i>Previously on</i> Ballard<i>...</i>

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,504
You're Detective Ballard, right?

3
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:05,881
I heard about what you did last year.

4
00:00:08,676 --> 00:00:10,343
- [Bosch] Don't move.
- LAPD.

5
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,595
- Who are you?
- Renée Ballard. RHD.

6
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:15,098
- What do you want?
- I want the files you stole from me.

7
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:18,143
{\an8}You call them the Flower Girls.
I've been assigned their cases.

8
00:00:18,144 --> 00:00:21,271
You think this is still your case, Bosch.
It's not. It's mine.

9
00:00:21,272 --> 00:00:23,357
- They're cutting me out.
- News flash, Dad.

10
00:00:23,983 --> 00:00:24,984
You're retired.

11
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:27,445
- LAPD!
- [grunts]

12
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:31,656
You do good work, Renée. Saved a life.

13
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:34,576
Maybe somewhere down the line
we'll get to work together again.

14
00:00:34,577 --> 00:00:37,078
Parker was the IO on the John Doe case
we just pulled.

15
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,497
Remember me?
I worked a murder back in 2020.

16
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:40,915
Mexican guy. Had a baby.

17
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:43,418
[Ballard] This is from a bus station
in San Diego.

18
00:00:43,419 --> 00:00:45,712
One of the last places
John Doe was seen alive.

19
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:46,964
That baby was never found.

20
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:49,883
[in Spanish] What happened?

21
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:51,302
Yulia is dead.

22
00:00:51,594 --> 00:00:52,678
Someone killed her.

23
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:54,138
Yulia?

24
00:00:55,139 --> 00:00:56,931
[in English]
The primary focus of this unit

25
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:58,975
remains the murder of Councilman's sister.

26
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:00,894
He was the number one suspect in '01.

27
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:02,562
He killed her.

28
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:05,440
[Ballard] <i>Sarah Pearlman's killer
left DNA behind at another crime scene.</i>

29
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:06,691
<i>Laura Wilson. Back in '08.</i>

30
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:09,110
<i>We might have a goddamn serial killer
on our hands.</i>

31
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:11,196
- Who was the investigator?
- [sighs]

32
00:01:11,197 --> 00:01:12,615
[Ballard] Harry Bosch.

33
00:01:35,638 --> 00:01:37,848
[detective] Didn't know
I was expecting company. [sighs]

34
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:41,309
How you doing? Renée Ballard, RHD.

35
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,145
Detective Neylon. Valley Bureau.

36
00:01:43,646 --> 00:01:44,647
This is my scene.

37
00:01:45,231 --> 00:01:47,358
Not sure it's sexy enough for RHD.

38
00:01:48,818 --> 00:01:50,860
[Ballard] Blue suits say
it's a robbery gone wrong.

39
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:52,112
Is that what you're thinking?

40
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:54,698
Shots were fired around 10:05.

41
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:57,075
She walked in on a 211 in-progress,

42
00:01:57,076 --> 00:01:59,703
spooked the robber,
got herself shot in the back.

43
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,287
What's your interest here?

44
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:03,790
There's a slight chance this may relate
to an unsolved case of mine.

45
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:06,000
- How's that?
- [clicks tongue] My vic stayed here.

46
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:07,086
That's all?

47
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:09,879
Pretty much.
It was an execution-style killing.

48
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,465
His body was dumped in the foothills
about five years ago.

49
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:15,510
Plenty of unsavories, uh,
make their way through this place.

50
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:16,595
Mostly by the hour.

51
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:20,306
And this here
is just another sad result of that.

52
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:23,018
Nothing exotic like your, uh, execution.

53
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:27,272
Hey, do you mind if I just
take a quick peek? Since I'm already here?

54
00:02:27,273 --> 00:02:28,440
Knock yourself out.

55
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:35,822
[shutter clicks]

56
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:37,866
[Ballard] You don't mind
if I take a few photos, do you?

57
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:39,285
Whatever you want.

58
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,161
[shutter clicks]

59
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,914
Was anything actually stolen?

60
00:02:44,707 --> 00:02:46,541
Hard to tell in this mess. [sighs]

61
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:49,295
Manager said three people paid cash
for last night.

62
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:51,963
Impromptu shooting gallery is my bet.

63
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:53,756
Maybe our guy was searching for remnants.

64
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:55,341
You get the vic's name?

65
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:56,552
Am I your secretary now?

66
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:59,388
I just gotta have something
to tell the captain.

67
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:02,390
Uh... [sighs]

68
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:04,560
Yulia Kravetz.

69
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:06,812
Is that Kravetz with an E?

70
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:08,814
Yeah.

71
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:10,482
[shutter clicks]

72
00:03:14,445 --> 00:03:16,280
- You look in here?
- Of course I did.

73
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,365
Why?

74
00:03:20,326 --> 00:03:22,661
Yulia was already in here
when your suspect showed up.

75
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:24,955
How do you figure?

76
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:26,664
Toilet paper.

77
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:28,375
You see that decorative fold?

78
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,836
And there's no water spots on the mirror.

79
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:34,756
She had already cleaned the bathroom
when your killer shot her.

80
00:03:34,757 --> 00:03:36,383
[clicks tongue] You've seen enough?

81
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:39,428
Yeah.

82
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,389
Oh, do you mind sharing ballistics
when it comes in?

83
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,308
I just need something
to compare to my cold case.

84
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:47,478
Sure thing. Top of my list.

85
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:05,453
How's it going?

86
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:07,580
Mind if I, uh, take a look
at the security footage?

87
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,375
[sighs] Do you guys not talk?
I already told the other guy.

88
00:04:10,376 --> 00:04:12,670
I know. I just need to check
one more thing.

89
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:15,381
Be my guest.

90
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:20,885
- Really appreciate your help.
- Mm-hmm. [sighs]

91
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:22,221
[typing]

92
00:04:27,643 --> 00:04:31,271
[breathes deeply]

93
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:42,992
[Ballard] Come on, come on, come on.

94
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:00,508
Oh, hey.

95
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:01,801
What are you still doing here?

96
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:04,013
No, I came back to give you my card
for ballistics.

97
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:06,889
Time for you to go.

98
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:07,975
Sure.

99
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:09,852
[Neylon sighs]

100
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:18,109
That guy's an asshole.

101
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,446
Neylon? He's just marking his territory.

102
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:23,282
You think she's the woman
who called RHD looking for you?

103
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:27,785
If she was, what if somebody
was trying to shut her up?

104
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,037
We're gonna find out.

105
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:32,457
And the fastest way to do that is to
find Yulia's killer and get him to talk.

106
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:35,127
How? With Neylon shutting us down?

107
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:38,338
That's not happening.
We're working this case.

108
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:40,632
We're just not gonna tell him about it.

109
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,936
- [Laffont] <i>Yello.</i>
- Hey. I'm still at the motel.

110
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,396
I got the vic's name.

111
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:59,567
- Hit me.
- <i>Yulia Kravetz. K-R-A-V-E-T-Z.</i>

112
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:02,111
Start sourcing info on her.
But do it on the down-low.

113
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:04,405
The detective working this case
is a little touchy.

114
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:07,116
Oh, yeah. [chuckles] I know the type.

115
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:08,201
Speaking of which...

116
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:09,285
Harry Bosch.

117
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:13,581
His captain reassigned the Laura Wilson
case after Bosch was put on leave.

118
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:17,211
But, looking at the book, he's the only
one who did any meaningful work on it.

119
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,297
We should probably loop him in, right?

120
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:23,633
Tell him his killer left DNA at our scene?

121
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:26,845
[sighs] We should,
but just hold off for now, all right?

122
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:29,098
My plate's already full. [sighs]

123
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,183
Okay.

124
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:33,102
- <i>Sure. Talk soon.</i>
- [mouthing words] Yeah.

125
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:35,229
[line clicks]

126
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:38,273
They're starting on Yulia.

127
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,819
In the meantime take a look at this.

128
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,570
Yulia's shooter?

129
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:48,157
[clicks tongue] I mean, that's my guess.
It's time-stamped right before the murder.

130
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,410
Look at that.
There could be a gun in there.

131
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:53,580
Neylon says it's a robbery gone wrong,
but I don't buy it.

132
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:57,084
Yulia had cleaned the bathroom already
before she was shot.

133
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:01,130
So she didn't walk in on the shooter.
He walked in on her.

134
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,423
- She was targeted.
- We don't know that.

135
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,509
I knew something was weird
about this place five years ago--

136
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,303
Parker. One step at a time.

137
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,182
[Zamira sighs]

138
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:15,853
Is that the woman you spoke to?

139
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:17,813
[Zamira] Claudia.

140
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:20,731
She clammed up
when she figured I was with the police.

141
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:23,694
[Ballard] Maybe she'll have more to say
away from the lights and sirens.

142
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:30,283
[chattering in Spanish]

143
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:31,785
- [whimpers]
- [Ballard in Spanish] <i>Hola.</i>

144
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:34,954
- [in English] Claudia?
- Mm-hmm.

145
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,498
- [Ballard speaking Spanish]
- No.

146
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,708
[in Spanish] She is a detective.

147
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:42,129
She needs to ask you
a few more questions, okay?

148
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:45,631
No, no. I don't know anything. I'm sorry.

149
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:49,510
[in English] The girls that work at
the motel, they don't talk to cops.

150
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:50,679
They're undocumented?

151
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:54,766
You can go.

152
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:05,027
So the girls, they don't talk to the cops.
Do they talk to you?

153
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:07,738
Some of them.

154
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,742
- What about Yulia?
- She did.

155
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:13,368
Sweet girl.

156
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:15,287
I did her hair.

157
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,249
Wild orchid. That was her color.

158
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:21,376
She'd been through a lot.

159
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:23,962
Was she undocumented too?

160
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:30,176
She came here from Ukraine.
[sighs] Through Poland first, then Mexico.

161
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,679
Paid a coyote to get her over the border.

162
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:37,267
Any idea who might
have wanted to hurt her?

163
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:39,728
A boyfriend, maybe?

164
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:41,980
Not sure.

165
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,525
Do you recognize this man?

166
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:49,404
I seen him around.

167
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:53,157
He comes in from time to time.

168
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:56,077
Asks for water and change.

169
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:57,162
So maybe homeless?

170
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:03,000
{\an8}We're gonna have to work
this one outside of typical avenues

171
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:04,252
{\an8}since it's not our case.

172
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:06,171
{\an8}Can't exactly run prints or DNA.

173
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:09,382
Yeah, on that.
Why are we catching a fresh one?

174
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:12,427
You missed the part where she said
Yulia might be tied to the John Doe?

175
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,679
At the moment,
this guy is our only suspect.

176
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,349
And if he didn't kill Yulia,
he could be a witness.

177
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:19,392
Fine. How do we catch the schmo?

178
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:22,645
Well, Ballard and I did a cursory check
on encampments around the motel,

179
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:24,146
but there are more in the neighborhood.

180
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:26,857
Worth checking nearby shelters,
uh, soup kitchens, churches.

181
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:31,028
And libraries. Quite a few unhoused folks
use the facilities at my branch.

182
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:33,115
It's a whole lot of ground to cover.

183
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:35,909
I know. You should get started.

184
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:40,413
We don't even know if this is our guy.
And it's 95 degrees out there today.

185
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:41,665
Bring a hat.

186
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:43,583
[smacks lips, scoffs]

187
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:49,089
Evidence from the Laura Wilson case
just landed.

188
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,716
Let's get 'em open. Get it on the board.

189
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:52,843
Let's see what we got.

190
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:56,680
Right.

191
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,813
[Bosch] <i>September 7th, 2008. 1300 hours.</i>

192
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:10,068
<i>Arrived at 877 Tamarind pursuant
to the reported homicide.</i>

193
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:17,408
What a mess.

194
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:20,746
That's what 17 years
with no arrest looks like.

195
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:26,752
{\an8}[Bosch] <i>Laura Wilson.
Age 26. Black. Aspiring actress.</i>

196
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:32,548
<i>Strangled manually.
Defensive wounds to hands and fingernails.</i>

197
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,384
<i>No signs of sexual assault.</i>

198
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:45,561
<i>Victim was single, lived alone.</i>

199
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:48,732
<i>Discovered by her mother after
Laura missed church on Sunday.</i>

200
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:09,586
<i>Last seen by friends Saturday night
at Barney's Beanery in West Hollywood.</i>

201
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:12,881
<i>They were celebrating
a commercial Laura shot.</i>

202
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:19,388
<i>Time of death, early the next morning:
September 7th, roughly 0100.</i>

203
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:38,323
Ballard.

204
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:46,164
Martina, track down a charger
for that Blackberry.

205
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:49,835
Parker, Colleen, look for any ties
between Brian Richmond and Laura.

206
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,753
Laffont, pull the DMV records
of all of our wits,

207
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:55,882
and call me
if there are any updates on Yulia.

208
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:58,468
I'm going to see Laura Wilson's mom.

209
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:00,137
On it, Boss.

210
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:03,974
Just Ballard's fine.

211
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:08,394
[engine stalls]

212
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:09,521
Come on, baby.

213
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:12,315
- [engine stalls, revs]
- Ha.

214
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:17,737
[sighs, mutters]

215
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:21,324
Little early to call it a day,
don't you think?

216
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,452
I'm going to conduct an interview.

217
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:26,663
- Family member of a victim.
- Uh-huh. Which case?

218
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:29,498
This new Laura Wilson murder,
or the one you caught this morning?

219
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:33,044
'Cause it seems to me you're opening cases
faster than you're closing them.

220
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,796
I'm sorry that you see it that way.

221
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:37,131
When you took control of this unit,

222
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:39,842
you assured me that my sister's case
was gonna be a top p--

223
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:43,804
Laura Wilson was strangled in 2008 by
the same person who killed your sister.

224
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:46,932
So working her case is working Sarah's.

225
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,518
And even if it wasn't, Councilman,

226
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:52,814
your sister is not more or less important
than any of my victims, okay?

227
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:55,525
Their families have been grieving too.

228
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,904
You said Laura was murdered in 2008?

229
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:01,490
Yeah.

230
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,159
September 7th, 2008. Why?

231
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,120
Then Brian Richmond couldn't have done it.

232
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,331
What do you mean?

233
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:13,376
He was out of the country in 2008.

234
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,755
Look, I kept tabs on him for years.

235
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:21,550
He was in Iraq. October 2007 to May 2009.

236
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:24,136
Two tours.
He didn't come back to the States once.

237
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,638
[sighs]

238
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,223
We linked the killings through DNA.

239
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:30,017
- Then the DNA is wrong.
- That's highly unlikely.

240
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:32,353
I put my faith in you, okay?

241
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:34,104
What you're talking about
isn't even possible.

242
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,315
It is possible.

243
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:39,528
[sighs]
If Brian Richmond isn't the killer.

244
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:42,614
God. Look...

245
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:44,406
[stammers]

246
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,909
Look, if what you're saying
about his deployment is true,

247
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:50,580
then he didn't kill Laura, and... [sighs]
...he didn't kill Sarah either.

248
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:56,294
[sighs]

249
00:13:57,921 --> 00:13:59,589
[huffs]

250
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:05,595
I spent 24 years hating that man.

251
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,352
It was infuriating watching him walk free
while my sister was in the ground.

252
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,358
My, um, mom died last year.

253
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:24,531
She was never sure about Brian,
and I think that's what killed her.

254
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:29,536
The not knowing. It ate her up inside.

255
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:35,250
I can't let the same thing happen
to my father.

256
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:38,920
Or to me, frankly.

257
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:43,633
Then let me get back to work.

258
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:50,974
[sniffles]

259
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:54,603
[sighing] God.

260
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:02,861
[landline ringing]

261
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:04,862
Yello.

262
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:06,780
Brian Richmond is off the board.

263
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:08,032
You're kidding.

264
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:10,117
<i>No. We gotta confirm with the NPRC,</i>

265
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:13,203
but according to Pearlman,
he was serving in Iraq when Laura died.

266
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:16,290
So, it's time to call Bosch in, right?

267
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,584
- <i>Get his take on Laura Wilson?</i>
- No, no, no, no, no.

268
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:22,839
I got Pearlman to deal with.
I got Neylon to work around. I got Rawls.

269
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,258
Last thing I need
is another swinging dick.

270
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,511
- No offense. [sighs]
- None taken.

271
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,389
[sighs] It's just,
given my last go-around with Bosch,

272
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,058
I just don't wanna ring that bell yet.

273
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:35,143
[doorbell rings]

274
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,315
[Ballard] Vivian Wilson?

275
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:43,860
I'm Renée Ballard. LAPD.

276
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:53,035
[Vivian] No one told me
about a cold case unit.

277
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:54,662
We've only been up and running
a few weeks,

278
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:56,455
and when I reopened your daughter's case...

279
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:57,999
I wasn't informed it was closed.

280
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:04,838
There's been some movement.
Do you recognize this girl?

281
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,174
Her name is Sarah Pearlman.

282
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:12,888
I found evidence that suggests

283
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:15,225
that she may have been killed
by the same man who killed Laura.

284
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:17,060
[scoffs]

285
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:21,940
It has been nine years since the LAPD sent
someone to talk to me about my daughter.

286
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:25,609
But now that her death is connected
to the murder of a white girl,

287
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:26,861
here comes the calvary.

288
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:29,947
Mrs. Wilson, Laura is important to me--

289
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:32,659
Do you understand the pain
of losing your only child?

290
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:37,622
No, I don't. And I'm sorry to do this.

291
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,542
I need to ask these questions
because the killer is out there right now,

292
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:43,044
and he could still be active.

293
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:51,636
I've never seen this girl,
and Laura never mentioned her.

294
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:55,223
There's nothing else
I can do for you, Detective.

295
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,499
[Ballard sighs]

296
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,918
[engine revs]

297
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:43,396
No one offers to help.

298
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,399
No one even looks at me.
And Windel gets away.

299
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,526
[Ava] But he didn't get away, did he?

300
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:52,071
You arrested him in the back
of that dry cleaners.

301
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:55,616
What I find interesting

302
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:59,662
is how this dream might relate
to another recent event in your life.

303
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:03,165
Renée, it's common
when victims of rape or sexual violence--

304
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,501
I wasn't raped.

305
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:08,087
Because you fought him off.

306
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:14,468
But I do wonder if running cold cases
is proving to be a secondary trauma--

307
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:15,678
You're reaching.

308
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:17,429
Am I?

309
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,389
It's a position you were forced into

310
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:22,977
precisely because your brothers in blue
turned their backs on you.

311
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:28,732
[stammers] In a way, maybe that betrayal
is harder to stomach than what Olivas--

312
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:30,610
You know what... [sighs]

313
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:33,737
Can we just focus on the shooting? Please.

314
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:36,699
That's what I'm mandated
to talk to you about, isn't it?

315
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:43,873
[sighs]

316
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:47,210
[elevator dings]

317
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:51,296
All right. It's not gonna be a problem.

318
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:55,176
There she is. Only woman I know
who takes her shotgun to the cleaners.

319
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:56,886
[clears throat]

320
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:04,978
Yeah, all the shrinks are on six.
Who they get you talking to?

321
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:06,937
Sandoval.

322
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:09,315
Oh. I like her. Nice rack.

323
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:12,192
You're an idiot, Pintero.

324
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:13,486
What? I'm kidding.

325
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:17,365
- You're always so uptight, Ballard.
- Hey. Leave it.

326
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,576
- [Pintero sighs]
- [exhales deeply]

327
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:22,953
- Hope the traffic's not too bad.
- [elevator dings]

328
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:24,414
Long way back to the Ahmanson.

329
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:32,255
- Have a good day, Renée.
- [Pintero] Come on, Chastain. Hurry up.

330
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:43,182
[breathes deeply]

331
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,192
Audition footage
of Laura Wilson's toothpaste ad.

332
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,946
I found it in one of
the more morbid corners of the Internet.

333
00:19:58,072 --> 00:19:59,990
She'd shot a series of spots
for the brand,

334
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:02,285
but they shelved the campaign
after her murder.

335
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:06,121
Martina, you got something?

336
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:09,041
[clicks tongue, stammers]
I don't know if it's...

337
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:10,335
There are no bad ideas.

338
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,465
I was looking through Sarah's yearbook.

339
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:17,925
She was in Drama Club.

340
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:20,345
So acting is something she could have
in common with Laura.

341
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:23,472
Definitely not rare in LA.
It could be how they crossed paths.

342
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:25,182
- Maybe worth a look?
- [Ballard] Mm-hmm.

343
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:29,811
Got an email from NPRC confirming
Brian Richmond's alibi.

344
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,313
Iraq '08.

345
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:32,648
All right. [sighs]

346
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:35,652
So we're back to square one
on the Pearlman/Wilson murders.

347
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:38,321
Anything is worth a look.

348
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:43,742
- Where are we with Rawls's search?
- [Zamira] No luck yet.

349
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:44,826
[Ballard sighs]

350
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:47,329
But I'm itching to get out there myself
if you don't need me here.

351
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:50,165
Yeah. Good. Go. Make sure he's
not just soaking up AC somewhere.

352
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,250
- [landline rings]
- All right.

353
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,462
Yello. Hey, Ravi.

354
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:56,339
[whispers] The morgue.

355
00:20:58,341 --> 00:20:59,842
No. No, I appreciate it.

356
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,844
Thanks for getting back to me.

357
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:06,557
Turns out Neylon
was a no-show at Yulia's autopsy.

358
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:08,559
It's his case.

359
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:14,773
[sighs] We need to get that bullet
ourselves and take it into ballistics.

360
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:17,484
There's gonna be hell to pay
if you go behind his back.

361
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:18,778
I'm not going. You are.

362
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:23,448
The sooner we know if Yulia's bullet
ties back to John Doe, the better.

363
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,243
[Laffont] Okay.

364
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:28,204
Can I go with him?

365
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:33,000
You wanna go to the morgue?

366
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:34,085
Definitely.

367
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:37,463
You know, for some
real-world cop experience.

368
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:42,592
Heard you had a crazy full moon
a few nights ago.

369
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:44,762
[chuckles] Yeah. Eleven homicides alone.

370
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:47,015
Made for some good overtime though.

371
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,560
Just wrapped up an hour ago.

372
00:21:56,024 --> 00:22:00,319
The bullet we removed from her back.
You clear this with Neylon?

373
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:02,113
As far as you know.

374
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:09,996
Hey. Hey.

375
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:12,498
You okay?

376
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:16,919
- Thanks.
- [Ravi] You're welcome.

377
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:28,973
Uh-uh.

378
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:31,059
You need a warrant for that.

379
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:32,934
It's a tent.

380
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:34,561
Rules are rules.

381
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:36,439
Oh. [sighs]

382
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:40,068
Sorry about that.

383
00:22:52,914 --> 00:22:54,916
- [chuckles]
- What?

384
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:58,377
[Ted] This is a blanket from the motel.

385
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:00,088
Huh? [chuckles]

386
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:04,175
Don't be all full of yourself now.

387
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,678
Hey, anybody know whose tent this is?

388
00:23:19,774 --> 00:23:20,900
I just wanna talk.

389
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:26,280
We found DNA that ties
Sarah's killer to another murder.

390
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:29,617
You gonna pin this one on me too?

391
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,786
The murder that happened in '08

392
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:34,080
when you were deployed.

393
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:37,458
We know it wasn't you, Brian.

394
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:40,920
We know you didn't kill Sarah.

395
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:56,644
I need to ask you if you've ever
seen this woman? Laura Wilson.

396
00:23:57,395 --> 00:23:59,188
Is it possible that Sarah knew her?

397
00:23:59,689 --> 00:24:00,815
Are you kidding me?

398
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:03,860
I'm sorry.

399
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:06,444
I know how much you've been through.

400
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:10,074
I just thought that maybe this
would give you some kind of peace.

401
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,578
I was 19 when Sarah was killed.

402
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:18,541
I was on defense from day
one 'cause of you people.

403
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,504
How the hell do you think
you're gonna give me peace?

404
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:30,136
Can you just go?

405
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:33,055
Please.

406
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,437
[sighs] Take care of yourself, Brian.

407
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:50,323
[phone ringing]

408
00:24:53,576 --> 00:24:54,993
- Rawls, what's up?
- <i>Hey.</i>

409
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:57,746
Uh, we got a lead. This homeless woman.

410
00:24:57,747 --> 00:24:59,624
Uh, sorry. Unhoused woman.

411
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:02,500
Uh, she had a blanket from the motel.

412
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:06,755
<i>Said she got it from a dude named Frosty,
and even IDed him off of your photo.</i>

413
00:25:06,756 --> 00:25:08,340
But now the volunteer at this shelter,

414
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:10,425
she said Frosty's
real name is Sean Wright.

415
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:12,344
<i>And if he's not here, you can find him</i>

416
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:14,721
squatting at some drug den
off of San Fernando.

417
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:15,848
You got an address?

418
00:25:31,948 --> 00:25:33,407
Cops. [screams]

419
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:36,117
- [squatters screaming]
- LAPD! Get your hands up!

420
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:37,161
[squatter] Run!

421
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:48,214
LAPD. Hands up. Hands up.

422
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:51,883
Sean. Sean, hands up!

423
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:54,553
Go, go, go. Out. Everybody out.

424
00:25:58,057 --> 00:25:59,684
Stay behind me, Rawls.

425
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:02,436
- Hands.
- [whimpers]

426
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:05,189
[Ted] Don't stop. Keep going.

427
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,860
Rawls.

428
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:11,779
[Ted grunts]

429
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:15,240
- You good?
- Go.

430
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:17,367
Sean Wright. Hands on your head.

431
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:19,536
Hands on your head. On your knees now.

432
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:21,246
Down, down, down.

433
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:24,166
- Now!
- [grunts, sighs]

434
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:27,712
[screams]

435
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:31,549
Holy shit.

436
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:36,470
- Shit.
- [grunts]

437
00:26:38,848 --> 00:26:42,310
[grunts, pants]

438
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,146
[horn honking]

439
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:49,191
Shit. [pants]

440
00:26:52,028 --> 00:26:53,487
[Sean grunts, pants]

441
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:56,907
[Ballard grunts]

442
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:00,328
[Sean grunts]

443
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:05,040
- Jesus.
- [Ballard groans]

444
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:07,001
He's running with a broken leg.

445
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,462
Shit can never just be easy.

446
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:17,219
Hi.

447
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,262
Ouch.

448
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:20,388
What happened to you?

449
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:22,390
Oh, no. It's fine. Uh, come on in.

450
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:23,641
Tutu's not home?

451
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,478
No. She's at a poker tournament
in La Jolla.

452
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:27,645
Hmm.

453
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:30,440
I'm not sure I feel right
being here without a chaperone.

454
00:27:30,441 --> 00:27:32,193
I'm sure Lola will keep an eye on you.

455
00:27:41,035 --> 00:27:42,536
I'd hate to see the other guy.

456
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:46,332
You know, he actually did more
damage to himself than I did to him.

457
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:50,585
He's currently in the hospital,
getting a fibula reset

458
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:54,048
and, um, coming down from PCP.

459
00:27:54,924 --> 00:27:58,176
Some days the biggest danger
I face at work is a sunburn.

460
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:01,429
[chuckles] Better watch out.

461
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:04,182
That face is no good to me
unless it's got a youthful glow.

462
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:05,309
[chuckles]

463
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,852
[sighs]

464
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:10,647
I knew you'd had
a bad day when you called.

465
00:28:10,648 --> 00:28:11,816
How?

466
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:15,235
- Honestly?
- Mm-hmm.

467
00:28:15,236 --> 00:28:16,821
Those are the only days you call.

468
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:18,447
[swallows]

469
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:20,533
That's not true.

470
00:28:27,123 --> 00:28:29,208
[sighs]

471
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:33,170
Sometimes it's just better for me

472
00:28:34,964 --> 00:28:38,007
if I can keep you in the dark.

473
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:42,847
Because then maybe
I can join you there. [sighs]

474
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:05,953
[utensils clattering]

475
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:22,261
You know, I could get used to this.

476
00:29:23,554 --> 00:29:24,805
So could I.

477
00:29:26,474 --> 00:29:28,725
Uh. Wow, this is embarrassing.

478
00:29:28,726 --> 00:29:31,144
[chuckles] Don't be silly.
I've seen all kinds.

479
00:29:31,145 --> 00:29:34,689
- Renée told me that you were, uh...
- In La Jolla. Yeah.

480
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,149
I came home this morning.

481
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:38,277
Busted out in the first round
of the tourney.

482
00:29:39,028 --> 00:29:40,112
That's too bad.

483
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:42,363
Ren was gone when I got home.

484
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:44,699
Uh, she said the captain
called her in early.

485
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,867
Uh, well, I'll just...

486
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:49,455
Grab a seat. I'm making breakfast.
You want some coffee?

487
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:53,292
Yeah.

488
00:30:02,051 --> 00:30:03,843
[Bosch] <i>September 10th, 2008.</i>

489
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:05,429
<i>1640 hours.</i>

490
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:08,014
<i>Spoke to witness Adam Lennox.</i>

491
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:09,683
<i>Friend of Laura Wilson.</i>

492
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:13,520
<i>Lennox stated he saw a blue van
parked outside Wilson's apartment...</i>

493
00:30:13,521 --> 00:30:15,105
[captain] Ballard. Let's go.

494
00:30:20,528 --> 00:30:21,529
Have a seat.

495
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,491
I believe you know Detective Neylon.

496
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:26,992
I do, sir.

497
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,660
Morning.

498
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:32,205
You're supposed to be
working the Pearlman case, correct?

499
00:30:32,206 --> 00:30:35,375
It is one of the investigations
I'm focused on, yes.

500
00:30:35,376 --> 00:30:36,501
And is that in any way relevant

501
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:39,338
to the Sunbeam murder
you highjacked from Detective Neylon?

502
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:42,925
- Sir, I didn't highjack--
- It's a simple yes or no.

503
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:46,052
[smacks lips] No, sir.

504
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:48,263
The Sunbeam case has nothing to do
with Sarah Pearlman,

505
00:30:48,264 --> 00:30:51,266
but I do believe it's related
to another cold case that I'm working,

506
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:53,851
- and I wanted to be a team player--
- You said you were RHD.

507
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,311
I am RHD.

508
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:57,231
Cold cases. That barely counts.

509
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:00,066
She stole my ballistics evidence.
She's way outta line.

510
00:31:00,067 --> 00:31:01,735
I couldn't agree more.

511
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:05,363
[clears throat]

512
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:07,116
But she's run circles around you.

513
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:09,826
What are you talking about?

514
00:31:09,827 --> 00:31:11,578
She arrested your guy yesterday.

515
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:13,706
Before you even had your first lead.

516
00:31:14,957 --> 00:31:16,749
- I was pursuing the--
- It's Ballard's case now.

517
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,127
She earned it.

518
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:23,340
You're dismissed.

519
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:26,885
[scoffs]

520
00:31:30,306 --> 00:31:31,307
[grunts]

521
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:41,274
I heard you got a little
roughed up bagging the guy.

522
00:31:41,275 --> 00:31:43,318
I don't like you
getting in these skirmishes.

523
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:46,446
- I had backup.
- A reserve officer and a volunteer.

524
00:31:46,447 --> 00:31:50,408
Well, Parker's a former cop, and she's put
in for her full-time reserve, so she's--

525
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:52,160
This suspect you got down at County...

526
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:53,703
case against him is thin.

527
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:56,790
Short of tying him to
a murder weapon you don't have.

528
00:31:57,291 --> 00:31:58,959
You're gonna need him to confess.

529
00:32:01,337 --> 00:32:02,338
Yes, sir.

530
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:05,840
I stuck my neck out for you, Ballard.

531
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:10,679
Recommended you for cold cases when
the Chief and others had a different idea.

532
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:13,849
- Yes, sir. I know.
- Sew it up.

533
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:38,457
[person] Spit and slide under.

534
00:32:43,212 --> 00:32:46,799
[chuckles] Renée Ballard bearing a gift.

535
00:32:47,383 --> 00:32:48,384
Hey, Freddie.

536
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:53,597
- Ooh. She's a beauty.
- Mm-hmm.

537
00:32:54,348 --> 00:32:55,848
Must be a big ask.

538
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:58,894
Well, I was hoping you could, uh,
bump me to the front of the line.

539
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:01,896
Uh, this about
the bullet Laffont dropped off?

540
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:03,732
Yeah. Yulia Kravetz murder.

541
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,610
Cap's really riding me on this one,
so the sooner the better.

542
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:09,071
There she is.

543
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:13,742
Hey, do you think you could also check
ballistics against a John Doe I'm working?

544
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:17,120
- [sighs]
- Freddie, did I mention this pot,

545
00:33:17,121 --> 00:33:18,414
hand-painted.

546
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:24,962
You got it. Case number?

547
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,926
[Bosch] <i>April 23rd, 2011.</i>

548
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:33,970
<i>Reinterviewed Adam Lennox.</i>

549
00:33:33,971 --> 00:33:35,055
<i>No new info.</i>

Mom.

555
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:08,547
Well, Mom...

556
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:13,134
O-Okay, and I will come see him tomorrow.

557
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:14,552
- I promise. I'm not gonna...
- [PA beeps]

558
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:16,637
[nurse on PA] <i>Dr. Gellar.
Please report to the Burn Unit.</i>

559
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:17,765
What? What?

560
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:20,350
No, it-it's nothing. It's...

561
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:24,103
[stammers] It's just some woman
in, uh, in the store.

562
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:25,397
I don't-I don't know, Mom.

563
00:34:28,484 --> 00:34:29,735
I have... I have to go.

564
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:32,237
Okay. I love you too.

565
00:34:33,322 --> 00:34:34,614
[nurse on PA] <i>Dr. Bernard,</i>

566
00:34:34,615 --> 00:34:36,073
- <i>please call line two.</i>
- [sighs]

567
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,658
[nurse on PA] <i>Dr. Bernard, line two.</i>

568
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:42,539
She had some feelings about
my time in the LAPD.

569
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:47,084
And if she gets a whiff of what I'm doing
right now, she'd have a lot more.

570
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,338
[sighs] Don't sit on it too long.

571
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:52,674
How'd it go with Berchem?

572
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:55,344
Well, he gave me the case officially.

573
00:34:55,928 --> 00:34:57,553
- Great.
- Yeah.

574
00:34:57,554 --> 00:35:00,139
But poaching Neylon's
investigation puts a target on my back,

575
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,432
so I gotta make something of it.

576
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:03,726
Okay. Well, let's get this guy to confess.

577
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:04,812
Yeah.

578
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:16,405
Mr. Wright, did you know Yulia Kravetz?

579
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:19,243
[stammers] I didn't like her one bit.

580
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:22,120
Did you shoot her, Mr. Wright?

581
00:35:23,372 --> 00:35:24,540
I never met her before.

582
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:27,626
You didn't like her,
but you never met her?

583
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:32,923
When we arrested you,
we found $600 in your pocket.

584
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,758
Where'd you get the money?

585
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:38,136
A man gave it to me. Uh, he paid me.

586
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:39,846
He paid you for what?

587
00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:41,557
My soul. [chuckles]

588
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:48,480
Did he tell you anything? About Yulia.

589
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:53,151
He said she was rotten.
And she'd make me rotten too.

590
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,195
Can you describe this man?

591
00:35:56,196 --> 00:35:59,574
Uh, he was blinding his eyes.

592
00:35:59,575 --> 00:36:02,077
Did he pay you to kill Yulia?

593
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:07,331
I thought you said he'd be sober by now.

594
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:08,499
He's dead-sober.

595
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,627
Our records show that he has
a history of severe mental illness.

596
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:13,088
This is just who he is.

597
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,465
[Ballard sighs]

598
00:36:16,258 --> 00:36:18,510
Whoever paid him knew he was long gone.

599
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:20,804
They used him as a weapon.

600
00:36:23,223 --> 00:36:24,432
Where'd you put the gun, Sean?

601
00:36:24,433 --> 00:36:26,726
[gasps] Oh. I planted it.

602
00:36:26,727 --> 00:36:28,311
Like a seed in the earth.

603
00:36:28,312 --> 00:36:31,939
I need you to tell me
where you put the gun, Sean.

604
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:36,403
I planted it,
and it grew into a rose garden.

605
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,197
[Ballard sighs]

606
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:44,369
[Parker] Thank you.

607
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:47,915
[sighs]

608
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:53,253
She started at the Sunbeam
in February, right?

609
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:57,674
Hey, what's up?

610
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,509
Nothing. I'm fine.

611
00:37:04,348 --> 00:37:05,474
[Laffont sighs]

612
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,603
The morgue.
I cannot stop thinking about it.

613
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:12,147
All that sadness in one place.

614
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,651
When I was a boot at RHD,

615
00:37:16,652 --> 00:37:20,739
my first partner told me that our job
was to honor the dead.

616
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:23,325
[sighs] I try to think

617
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:25,410
if they could talk,

618
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,455
what would they want from me?

619
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:36,712
- So Sean Wright was a bust, huh?
- [Ballard scoffs]

620
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:38,130
Guy's barely coherent.

621
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:41,218
Even if he did confess,
it would never hold up in court.

622
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:43,929
Then we really need to find that gun.

623
00:37:44,513 --> 00:37:45,681
Yes, we do.

624
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:49,600
I sent Rawls and Parker to search
the area around the drug den.

625
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:52,688
But I need you to coordinate with them
to set up a proper grid search.

626
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:56,315
Also, he mentioned... [sighs]
...burying the gun,

627
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:59,610
so check all tree-lined streets,
all surrounding parks.

628
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,196
- [sighs]
- [Bosch] Ballard.

629
00:38:03,699 --> 00:38:04,908
Harry.

630
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:06,576
Need a word.

631
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:16,043
I have spent years building
a rapport with Vivian Wilson.

632
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:18,671
- You blow it up in one night?
- There've been developments.

633
00:38:18,672 --> 00:38:19,755
Bullshit.

634
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:21,966
You just wanna show the councilman
you're out there shaking trees.

635
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:23,217
I'm not shaking trees.

636
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:25,761
You're trying to connect
Laura's murder to Sarah.

637
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:26,888
I'm not trying.

638
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:30,057
They are connected. Through DNA.

639
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:32,768
There was no DNA at the Pearlman
crime scene. Everyone knows that.

640
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:34,146
Everyone was wrong.

641
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:37,733
I lifted Touch DNA
from the fingerprint tape.

642
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:47,116
Smart.

643
00:38:47,117 --> 00:38:48,201
Thanks.

644
00:38:51,955 --> 00:38:54,458
- Let me buy you lunch.
- Sure.

645
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:57,251
[Bosch] Should I take it personally?

646
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:58,711
[Ballard] Take what personally?

647
00:38:58,712 --> 00:39:03,049
[stammers] That you didn't call me up
to come and turn your cold case closed.

648
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:05,302
- [chuckles]
- [chuckles] Mmm.

649
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:07,928
You would never last.

650
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:09,430
You're a lone wolf, Harry Bosch.

651
00:39:09,431 --> 00:39:13,225
Oh, yeah. Says the detective
who decided not to reach out

652
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:15,937
and get the background
on the Laura Wilson case.

653
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:20,734
You know, I'm just trying to get
my head around how to run this unit.

654
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:23,070
It wasn't exactly in my five-year plan.

655
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:25,946
But the brass didn't give me much choice.

656
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:27,865
I really pissed some people off.

657
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:30,452
Yeah, I heard about that.
I'm sorry it didn't go your way.

658
00:39:31,453 --> 00:39:34,872
Well, ironically, I'm now defending
the institution that shit all over me.

659
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:37,083
Yeah. Sounds about right.

660
00:39:37,084 --> 00:39:40,503
You know, it doesn't even matter if
it's a family member or a former suspect.

661
00:39:40,504 --> 00:39:44,673
Everyone is so mad at the LAPD.
And I'm the punching bag.

662
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:45,926
Yeah, I don't envy you.

663
00:39:47,636 --> 00:39:49,012
Finding a killer is like

664
00:39:50,764 --> 00:39:52,348
finding a needle in a haystack.

665
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:56,560
Except with a cold case,
haystack's been blown all over the field.

666
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:58,604
Too bad I'm not good at anything else.

667
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:00,023
[chuckles] Amen, sister.

668
00:40:00,649 --> 00:40:05,361
But... Can think of worse ways
to live out your career.

669
00:40:05,362 --> 00:40:08,531
Working with the team you handpicked.
Out at the Ahmanson.

670
00:40:08,532 --> 00:40:10,117
Away from all the prying eyes...

671
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:16,123
I miss Homicide.

672
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:17,624
I understand.

673
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:22,002
Somehow I think if
I prove myself in cold cases

674
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:24,256
that maybe things can go
back to the way they were.

675
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:30,303
The way things were
might not exist anymore.

676
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:37,769
Let's look at the Laura Wilson book.

677
00:40:38,979 --> 00:40:42,399
You know, most departments would have
blue suiters on a grid search like this.

678
00:40:43,108 --> 00:40:45,401
Most departments don't
let civilians solve murders.

679
00:40:45,402 --> 00:40:46,527
I'm not a civilian.

680
00:40:46,528 --> 00:40:49,029
Reserves can do anything
sworn officers can.

681
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,115
Mm-hmm.

682
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:53,367
Look, I got no problem
being out here all this time.

683
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:55,787
I wanna solve Yulia's murder
just as bad as you do.

684
00:40:56,413 --> 00:40:57,454
Yeah, I doubt that.

685
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:02,376
But if Frosty's gun is-is, like,
the linchpin here, we need more bodies.

686
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:05,338
We need uniformed officers, cadets even.

687
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:08,758
What? What are you looking at?

688
00:41:09,843 --> 00:41:13,221
Frosty said that he planted a gun,
and it grew a rose garden.

689
00:41:18,435 --> 00:41:19,644
Oh.

690
00:41:22,522 --> 00:41:24,565
Sorry, I got nothing to add to that.

691
00:41:24,566 --> 00:41:26,483
- It's a frustrating case.
- Yeah.

692
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,986
- No major breaks.
- That's how the book reads.

693
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:31,448
- Any hunches?
- Harmon Harris.

694
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:35,994
Didn't have a motive for him,
but I didn't like his alibi.

695
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:37,703
What do you mean you didn't like it?

696
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:39,914
Well, he and this other guy, Adam Lennox,

697
00:41:39,915 --> 00:41:42,209
they said that they'd
been out together that night.

698
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:46,503
Their stories were identical,
which tell you they were rehearsed.

699
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,588
Yeah.

700
00:41:47,589 --> 00:41:51,760
Ironically, this guy Lennox was
a student in Harris's acting class.

701
00:41:53,386 --> 00:41:55,222
Sarah Pearlman was interested in acting.

702
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:57,974
Maybe Harmon Harris coached her too.

703
00:41:58,475 --> 00:41:59,643
Good a lead as any.

704
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:04,231
[Ted] You ready to give up yet?

705
00:42:04,773 --> 00:42:06,774
Guy was coming down hard.

706
00:42:06,775 --> 00:42:08,692
The rose thing is probably nonsense.

707
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:10,862
- Do you ever shut up?
- Hey.

708
00:42:11,404 --> 00:42:12,405
[Parker] Jesus.

709
00:42:16,368 --> 00:42:18,369
So... [clears throat] ...this Adam Lennox guy,

710
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:19,870
he was the one outside
of Laura's apartment?

711
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:22,122
- He saw the blue van?
- Yeah, a few nights before.

712
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:25,876
And I couldn't figure out if it was part
of this whole story that they'd cooked up.

713
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:28,420
You know, a false lead,
take the heat off of Harris.

714
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:32,132
Lennox said it was a blue van.
The license plate started with...

715
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:33,093
A four.

716
00:42:33,927 --> 00:42:35,469
Yeah. Checked it out.

717
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:39,181
Over 3,000 vans that fit that description
that were on the road at that time.

718
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:41,518
- [phone rings]
- Yeah. Needle in a haystack.

719
00:42:42,978 --> 00:42:44,019
Yeah, Parker.

720
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,312
We found a gun.

721
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:46,438
You did?

722
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:47,857
<i>Six shooter.</i>

723
00:42:48,525 --> 00:42:50,943
Next to a mural with a bunch of roses
if you could believe it.

724
00:42:50,944 --> 00:42:52,444
All right. Let's get it to FAU

725
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:55,156
and, uh, see if the bullet matches
the one that killed Yulia.

726
00:42:55,699 --> 00:42:57,032
- I'll see you there.
- <i>Okay.</i>

727
00:42:57,033 --> 00:42:58,450
Laura Wilson?

728
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:00,995
No, it's a different case. But I gotta go.

729
00:43:00,996 --> 00:43:03,497
You need me, just whistle real loud.

730
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:04,708
Thanks, Harry.

731
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:10,045
Survey says,
the bullet from Yulia Kravetz's body

732
00:43:10,046 --> 00:43:11,965
was indeed fired by
the six-shooter you found.

733
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:15,050
Given Sean Wright's prints
are on that gun...

734
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:16,636
We got Frosty dead to rights.

735
00:43:17,262 --> 00:43:18,470
Any hits in the system?

736
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:19,930
No. Nothing.

737
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:21,890
Not even on my John Doe?

738
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:23,642
[sighs] I looked that one up specifically.

739
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:26,438
Turns out that bullet from
that case was never even analyzed.

740
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:29,773
- You sure?
- Mmm.

741
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:32,109
Could've gotten lost in
the shuffle at Property.

742
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:34,279
- It happens.
- [sighs] Shame.

743
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:37,407
No wonder that case went cold. Hmm.

744
00:43:41,578 --> 00:43:44,038
I called in that bullet to be analyzed.

745
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:46,291
- Parker, you sure?
- I know I did.

746
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,459
It was right before I left the force,

747
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:50,545
otherwise I would've
followed up on it myself.

748
00:43:51,504 --> 00:43:55,258
[sighs] I'm telling you, someone in
the LAPD let John Doe's murder go cold.

749
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:00,597
If you're right,
and I'm not saying you are...

750
00:44:01,473 --> 00:44:04,434
[sighs] ...we're headed for
some dark fucking waters.

751
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,902
[phone buzzes]

752
00:44:14,944 --> 00:44:15,945
Hey.

753
00:44:17,572 --> 00:44:19,657
Hey all is <i>bueno</i>. Case closed.

754
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:21,909
She arrested the shooter.

755
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:24,746
And you know he's a dead end.
Can't even string a sentence together.

756
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:26,748
This won't come back on us.

757
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:33,171
Sure, I could have a little fun with that.

758
00:44:34,631 --> 00:44:35,632
Shit.

759
00:44:36,341 --> 00:44:37,634
She won't know what hit her.
