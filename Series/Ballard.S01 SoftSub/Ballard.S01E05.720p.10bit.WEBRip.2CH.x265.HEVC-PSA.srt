1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:01,835
[Ballard] <i>Previously on</i> Ballard<i>...</i>

2
00:00:01,836 --> 00:00:03,253
[Chastain's wife]
<i>He knew he got it wrong, Renée.</i>

3
00:00:03,254 --> 00:00:06,589
He overheard Olivas joking
about sleeping with an ex-partner.

4
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:08,258
But it was the way that Olivas said it.

5
00:00:08,259 --> 00:00:10,343
It was like he had crossed a line
with this woman.

6
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,471
He tried to assault me at a party.

7
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:14,848
Jake can feel what he wants about Ballard.

8
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:17,475
If she's bungling the investigation,
I need to know.

9
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:19,686
Yesterday on the Pearlman case,
this was our list.

10
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:23,857
Today, we have narrowed it down
to 378 blue Ford vans.

11
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:27,110
Gonna be near impossible
investigating potential corruption

12
00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:28,486
without stepping on a land mine.

13
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:29,696
So we should just ignore it?

14
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:31,614
[Ballard] This doesn't work
unless we're all on the same page.

15
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:32,866
You need to start trusting me.

16
00:00:32,867 --> 00:00:34,033
<i>We got a hit on that dummy bullet?</i>

17
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,453
Guy's name is Javier Fuentes.
He's actually still in county.

18
00:00:36,454 --> 00:00:38,413
- Who is he?
- He's a coyote for the cartel.

19
00:00:38,414 --> 00:00:40,540
A ring of cops is running hot guns.

20
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:43,626
They take 'em straight off the streets
and sell them to the cartel for big bank.

21
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:44,919
The gun. Who gave it you?

22
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,962
It was definitely a cop.

23
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:48,339
LAPD. White dude, 40s.

24
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,342
Here are six candidates.

25
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:52,803
This guy, Anthony Driscoll.

26
00:00:53,304 --> 00:00:56,223
He's got more than a few complaints
against him for excessive force.

27
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:57,766
[Javi] That's him right there.

28
00:00:57,767 --> 00:00:59,642
If you find him,
I bet you find the others.

29
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:02,061
I would kill for the experience
you're getting in Cold Cases.

30
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,855
I'm shooting for detective
in a couple years.

31
00:01:03,856 --> 00:01:04,940
[Driscoll] So...

32
00:01:06,317 --> 00:01:07,693
[sighs]

33
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:10,362
...tell me about your new girlfriend.

34
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:24,459
You don't intentionally
make their fries soggy.

35
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,003
- Ever. And if you do...
- [waitress] Hi there. Hibiscus margarita.

36
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:28,588
- Thank you.
- Yeah, of course.

37
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,424
- And then, an old-fashioned. Yeah.
- Thank you.

38
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:33,968
So I'm working on getting
another medical certification.

39
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:37,306
Hoping it'll speed things along
in the EMT program.

40
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,599
- That's exciting.
- [Aaron] It's been tough

41
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,184
- juggling classes with work.
- Hey, baby.

42
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:42,602
- Where are you going?
- [waitress] Uh.

43
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,188
I'm also back around later.

44
00:01:45,815 --> 00:01:49,235
But, uh, pretty soon,
I'm gonna be able to get on the truck.

45
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,736
- I hear the first...
- [waitress] No, I...I...

46
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:53,321
[patron] Come on.

47
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:54,864
- [waitress] I've got to go to the bar.
- Whoa, hey. What's up?

48
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:56,367
[patron] Can I get a kiss?

49
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,036
- I love you.
- Okay. Love you too.

50
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,500
- [sighs] Nothing. I... [grunts]
- [Aaron] Are you sure?

51
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:07,377
You seem a little out of it.
Is everything okay?

52
00:02:07,378 --> 00:02:09,045
[Ballard sighs]

53
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:10,631
I'm sorry. I just, uh...

54
00:02:11,841 --> 00:02:14,718
These cases. I-I feel like
I'm seeing bad guys everywhere.

55
00:02:15,845 --> 00:02:17,721
- Peekaboo.
- [laughs]

56
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:19,932
[sighs] Oh, uh...

57
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:22,226
This too.

58
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,106
- It's okay?
- Sure.

59
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,693
Now you be a good boy for your mom now.

60
00:02:31,694 --> 00:02:32,694
Okay.

61
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:33,945
All right.

62
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:35,030
Thanks.

63
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:38,575
[line ringing]

64
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:40,577
Not a bad break. I must say it myself.

65
00:02:40,578 --> 00:02:42,579
- Mm-hmm. All right. Watch this.
- [chuckles]

66
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,956
Okay, hold on one second.

67
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,085
Hey. Uh, sorry, I meant to reach out.

68
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,128
Hope you're not getting distracted.

69
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:51,504
Nah.

70
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:52,590
Never that.

71
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,426
You sure?

72
00:02:56,135 --> 00:02:57,927
'Cause I shouldn't have to call you
for an update.

73
00:02:57,928 --> 00:02:59,137
<i>Where we at with things?</i>

74
00:02:59,138 --> 00:03:01,764
Hey, it's all good. I'm in like Flynn.

75
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:04,058
<i>Okay, lover boy. Take what you want.</i>

76
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:05,935
Just make sure I get what I need. Quickly.

77
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:08,354
Otherwise, we'll have to get creative.

78
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:11,065
Okay. [chuckles] Okay. Don't get crazy.

79
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,526
Don't make me.

80
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:16,071
What's up?

81
00:03:16,906 --> 00:03:17,906
Here.

82
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:19,199
Let me show you something.

83
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:20,910
Okay.

84
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:23,620
Okay. Ready?

85
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:24,705
Mm-hmm.

86
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:26,331
You're an expert now?

87
00:03:26,332 --> 00:03:28,875
Oh, I got a few tricks
up my sleeve. Uh-huh.

88
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,877
- Widen your stance a little bit.
- Mm-hmm.

89
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,255
- Elbow down just a tad.
- Mm-hmm.

90
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:37,927
I like my way better.

91
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,684
- Well, I can't argue with that.
- Mm-hmm.

92
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,687
["I'm Hung Up On You" playing on radio]

93
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:04,078

94
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:16,340
[tense music plays]

95
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:19,843
[car lock beeps]

96
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,083
[person] Hey, Tony.

97
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,423
[chuckles] Good to see you.

98
00:04:58,424 --> 00:04:59,508
You're late.

99
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,094
Mama told me to never arrive empty-handed.

100
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,055
- Chunky Monkey.
- [thumping]

101
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:07,515
Van's loaded up outside.

102
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:09,392
- Ah.
- It's got all the toys.

103
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:10,477
[thumping]

104
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,313
Like water into wine, Jesus.

105
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:16,191
- You, uh... You mind if I say hi?
- Go.

106
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:18,902
[both chuckle]

107
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:22,406
[muffled grunting]

108
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:25,825
[Driscoll sighs]

109
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,744
- I can't help you.
- [cries]

110
00:05:27,745 --> 00:05:29,538
[Driscoll] I'm just the delivery guy.

111
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,791
[inhales sharply, grunts]

112
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,045
Today, it's guns. Yesterday...

113
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:38,964
- Yesterday, it was you.
- [breathing shakily]

114
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:42,426
But I'm not complaining.
You were easy money.

115
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:48,182
[sniffs] What they do with what I deliver?
Now, that's none of my business.

116
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:52,643
Just like whatever you were snitching
about was none of yours.

117
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,313
[muffled cries]

118
00:05:55,981 --> 00:06:00,235
- You shoulda kept your mouth shut.
- [muffled screams, cries]

119
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:03,030
Always a pleasure.

120
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:05,074
- You need a ride?
- Thanks.

121
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,451
I got one.

122
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,887
[birds chirping]

123
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:34,436
[alarm clock ringing]

124
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,569
[ringing continues]

125
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,741
[sighs]

126
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:56,667
[ringing continues]

127
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,261
[Ted] It's like the Van Show around here.

128
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:12,850
We're still running 'em down.
Um, not the most exciting part of the job.

129
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,394
Yeah, not the most productive either.

130
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:20,356
Well, I... Until a better lead comes along,
this is the one we're mining.

131
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:23,484
Waiting for one to come along
isn't exactly a great look, Rawls.

132
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,570
- Good morning.
- Oh, hey.

133
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:26,655
Detective Ballard.

134
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:32,244
Rawls was just catching me up
on the strides you're making.

135
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:33,870
Yeah, I bet he was.

136
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:37,291
You know, it's just a lot of man-hours
devoted to these vans though.

137
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:41,378
Are you sure you're not putting
all your eggs in one basket?

138
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,506
A blue Ford van was spotted at two
murders that we related to Sarah's case.

139
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:48,301
So, yes, I'm confident
we're pursuing our best lead.

140
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:49,386
Mmm.

141
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:51,804
You know, the success of this new unit

142
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,433
could be a critical component
to Jake's upcoming election.

143
00:07:55,809 --> 00:08:00,146
We'd really like to see Sarah's case
closed before the ballots go out.

144
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,106
Oh, yeah. Well, wouldn't that be nice?

145
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:05,152
Except my investigations don't run
on your political timeline.

146
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:08,488
They don't run at all
without Councilman's influence.

147
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:16,205
How about a weekly check-in moving forward
to make sure we're all on the same page?

148
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,041
Sure.

149
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:20,667
Great.

150
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,339
I look forward to
working together more closely.

151
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:36,224
It's not looking good.
Fifty vans down and they're all dead ends.

152
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:38,267
- How many are left?
- Four. But they were all scrapped.

153
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,102
That's why they got pushed
to the bottom of the list.

154
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:41,687
We can still check out the prior owner.

155
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,190
See if they have any overlap
with our victims.

156
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:46,234
But any hope of physical evidence?
That's out the window.

157
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:47,985
- Damn it.
- No, don't listen to him.

158
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:50,279
I actually think one of these
could be promising.

159
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,282
- Promising how?
- [Colleen] It's number 53 on the list.

160
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:56,118
My husband and I were married
on May 3rd. 5, 3.

161
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:57,871
- Oh, boy.
- [Martina chuckles]

162
00:08:58,455 --> 00:08:59,455
What?

163
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:02,792
I am just following my gut.
Isn't that what you people do?

164
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:04,628
She's not wrong.

165
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:08,130
- Colleen.
- Van number 53 was scrapped in 2009.

166
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:11,300
But before that, it was registered
to a woman named Jenny Garrison.

167
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,678
- She lives in the valley.
- All right. I'll pay her a visit.

168
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,513
You guys dig in on the remaining three.

169
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:19,518
If I have to start over on this case,
I need to know sooner rather than later.

170
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:21,895
Do you mind if I go with?

171
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:23,730
Let's go.

172
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,150
Three vans left. One for each.

173
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,610
One.

174
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:30,779
Two.

175
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,824
Where is Laffont, anyway?
He's missing all the fun.

176
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:41,456
["Canon and Gigue in D major" playing]

177
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:46,002
You are in luck.
I'm whipping up a batch of baby Bundts,

178
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:47,878
and I need a taste tester.

179
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,588
A batch of baby Bundts?

180
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,299
- Mini Bundt cakes.
- [scoffs]

181
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,675
Then why not say that?

182
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:57,096
[stammers] My affinity for alliteration
is a gift whether you recognize it or not.

183
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,597
Just taste it.

184
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,683
Hmm?

185
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:05,688
- And this is--
- Lemon lavender.

186
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:07,773
I know. You weren't expecting it.

187
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,526
That is an elevated flavor profile
right there.

188
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,947
Mmm. And maybe a little less lavender.

189
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,783
- I mean, you're almost there, babe.
- [grunts] No, no, no.

190
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,244
- You are almost there.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Less lavender it is.

191
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,330
I got it. Hmm.

192
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:23,831
What are you working on anyway?

193
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:28,919
You haven't brought a case home in ages.
And certainly not one this color coded.

194
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,629
- Just a pet project...
- Huh.

195
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:36,261
...that requires more space and quiet
than the office allows.

196
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,513
Oh. [chuckles]

197
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:41,891
Well, I like it.
It's nice having you home.

198
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:44,895
Back to the lab
to address your aggressive note.

199
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:48,982
[phone buzzes]

200
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:51,942
Yello.

201
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:52,985
How's it coming?

202
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:56,113
It's coming.
I've been retracing Driscoll's steps,

203
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:59,075
working backward
from the time he resigned.

204
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:01,828
But at a certain point
his footprints disappear.

205
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,872
Well, the guy went undetected
in the LAPD for years,

206
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:06,832
so he certainly knows
how to cover his tracks.

207
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,085
No doubt.

208
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,296
Let me keep digging. I'll call you.

209
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,466
We are running out of road
on both these cases.

210
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:18,011
So I'm really hoping
one of these vans pays off.

211
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:23,225
Something on your mind?

212
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:28,897
Were you and Olivas close?

213
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:32,984
We were friendly.

214
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:35,444
I didn't know him very well.

215
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,030
Certainly not well enough.

216
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,575
You guys were partners.
What was that like?

217
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:48,500
It was good.

218
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:54,005
[sighs]

219
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:13,816
- Jenny Garrison?
- Yeah.

220
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:16,486
We've got some questions
about a van you scrapped in 2009.

221
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:23,034
My ex-husband, Mike, took off
with that van nearly 30 years ago.

222
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:24,828
You should be asking him.

223
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:27,538
We'd love to,
if you can tell us where to find him.

224
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:28,790
Wish I knew.

225
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:31,585
He ran off with someone. Another woman.

226
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:34,045
I haven't seen or heard from him since.

227
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:36,548
Any chance you know this woman's name?

228
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:39,551
Side Piece Denise.

229
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:42,721
Denise McKenzie.

230
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,516
She was a singer
at that Mormon choir in Utah.

231
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,727
Latter Day Saint, my ass.

232
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:52,230
Why didn't you ever report the van stolen?

233
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:57,401
Look, Mike was an abusive prick.

234
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:00,697
If that van was the price for my freedom,
I got off cheap.

235
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:03,449
What is this about?

236
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,451
Well, we believe that
your van has been spotted

237
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,495
at several crime scenes
that we're investigating.

238
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:09,079
The quickest way for us to confirm

239
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,082
if your ex-husband was involved or not
is through DNA.

240
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,919
Are these rapes we're talking about?

241
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,879
Oh, my God.

242
00:13:17,506 --> 00:13:18,506
Did he kill someone?

243
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:20,341
Ma'am, we are not at liberty
to tell you that.

244
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:21,635
He did, didn't he?

245
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:25,055
- I knew he had it in him.
- [Parker] Ms. Garrison.

246
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:28,391
Do you have any of his belongings
from back then?

247
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,142
I might.

248
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,020
[stutters] I gave it all away.

249
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:36,274
The only trace I have left of him
is the one good thing he gave me.

250
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:38,944
My daughter.

251
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,781
Actually, a cheek swab from both of you,
and we'll be able to run it and--

252
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:48,702
No. Uh, things
are, uh, delicate with Trish.

253
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:50,204
Ma'am, we're going to need to talk to her.

254
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:53,624
She's been dealing with the fallout
of her father leaving her all her life.

255
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,460
She's just gotten sober.

256
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:58,504
She's barely holding down a job at Costco.

257
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,924
I am not gonna jeopardize all that.

258
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,519
Something tells me
Trish doesn't stay out of this.

259
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,606
Not a chance. We're getting that DNA
whether her mom likes it or not.

260
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:25,407
[landline rings]

261
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,785
Cold Case tip line. Martina speaking.

262
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:30,829
Yes, yes we do.

263
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:32,914
[inhales sharply] Uh-huh.

264
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:35,166
Okay.

265
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,753
Oh, your great uncle did it.

266
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:40,879
Mm-hmm.

267
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,341
Um, can you spell his name for me?

268
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:49,221
I will pass this along to a detective.

269
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,307
Thank you.

270
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:52,350
[mouthing] It never ends.

271
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:57,021
Guys, I just saw our furry friend
in the break room.

272
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:58,523
Friend is a strong word.

273
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,025
And not one we use for no damn rat.

274
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:04,236
He's a mouse. And I think he's nesting
in the conference room.

275
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,905
What, the mouse is back?
Time to bring in the Borax.

276
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,700
No. Let me get some traps.
The catch-and-release kind.

277
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:10,994
Or the other kind.

278
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:16,498
Colleen thinks the mouse
is nesting in the conference room.

279
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,542
Time to clean that out. [sighs]

280
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:20,295
Did you get Trish Garrison's address?

281
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:23,505
DMV's not current
and mom's still stonewalling.

282
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,050
Damn it. We need that DNA.

283
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:29,763
I just found out Denise McKenzie
has been missing for the last 28 years.

284
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:31,764
What?

285
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:33,182
- Holy moly.
- [Ballard] Yeah.

286
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:36,102
Her parents reported her missing
in Salt Lake City in 1997.

287
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:37,686
No mention of Mike,

288
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:40,607
which means that they probably
didn't know about the relationship.

289
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,734
Gives a whole new meaning
to running away together.

290
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,152
Assuming she ran away with him at all.

291
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,530
If he is our killer,
she could be his first victim.

292
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:52,410
Did, uh, Jenny say
that Trish just got a new job?

293
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:54,120
- Costco.
- Find her.

294
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:55,829
Anything new on Mike?

295
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,414
Any crossover with Sarah?

296
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:58,957
He pulled quite the disappearing act.

297
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:03,212
After '97, there's no phone records,
no credit cards, no tax payments.

298
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:05,339
Sounds like he doesn't wanna be found.

299
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,008
So that makes this van our best lead.

300
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:09,218
[sighs] Okay.

301
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:12,429
Contact the NICB. Get a detailed
report of its history, all right?

302
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,932
Call me when you get it. I'll be back.

303
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:17,768
Looks like number 53
may be lucky after all.

304
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:19,269
[chuckles]

305
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:22,147
[Laffont] This looks like Driscoll
took a three-month vacation, right?

306
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:25,442
But once I started looking into it,
I found a slew of articles,

307
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:27,736
including a huge piece in the <i>LA Times</i>

308
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:30,447
about a major takedown
of a local drug ring.

309
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:34,284
This gap coincides with that takedown.

310
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:35,452
And get this.

311
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:39,331
"The investigation relied heavily
on undercover LAPD officers

312
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:42,377
who were part of a task force
run by the DEA."

313
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:44,712
So if Driscoll was
a part of that operation--

314
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:46,463
We could find some
of his criminal contacts.

315
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:47,882
Or corrupt cops.

316
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:50,176
Let's talk to the lead agent.

317
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,429
- Oh.
- Don't.

318
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:54,639
Trust me.

319
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:58,309
- We're out, babe.
- Okay, bye.

320
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:06,568
[officer] Parker?

321
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:10,572
Trish Garrison?

322
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:12,364
Thanks for coming in.

323
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,575
What's this about?

324
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:17,120
Why don't you come take a seat.

325
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:22,417
[whispers] Thanks.

326
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:28,381
I knew my dad was a deadbeat,
but this is crazy.

327
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:33,094
Sometimes people aren't
who we think they are.

328
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:35,138
[scoffs]

329
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,770
And one of the victims was Sarah Pearlman?

330
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:48,359
I heard about her.

331
00:17:57,619 --> 00:18:00,914
If I open this door, I... [sighs]
I might not like what I find.

332
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:10,215
Believe me, if there was any other option,
I would not ask you to do this.

333
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:13,843
I think, uh...

334
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:18,598
I think wondering would be worse.

335
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:29,108
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

336
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:37,826
[phone rings]

337
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:41,036
- Hey, how'd it go?
- [Parker] <i>Trish was a champ.</i>

338
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:42,247
<i>Even called her mom.</i>

339
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:45,833
I mean, the woman gave me an earful,
but she's gonna let me swab her too.

340
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:46,959
Hell, yeah.

341
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,420
Now, I'm headed to take this sample down
to Forensics myself.

342
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:52,131
After what happened to that bullet,

343
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:55,259
I'm not taking the chance
any more evidence goes missing.

344
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,426
I hear that.

345
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:58,720
Hey, tell Darcy if she moves this
to the front of the line,

346
00:18:58,721 --> 00:18:59,847
I'll be her best friend.

347
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:00,932
[Parker] <i>Will do.</i>

348
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:05,311
It's definitely in there. I'm telling you.
Marble was barking like crazy.

349
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:06,813
[grunts]

350
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:09,107
Thanks.

351
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:11,734
Agent Trejano?

352
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:15,445
Detectives Ballard and Laffont. LAPD.

353
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:18,073
- Thanks for fitting us in.
- Yeah, sure thing. How can I help?

354
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:21,243
We had some questions
about a task force you ran in 2018.

355
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:24,289
- Had a lot of our guys undercover.
- Oh, yeah. Great White.

356
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,249
That was a big one.

357
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,418
Do you remember
a detective named Anthony Driscoll?

358
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:31,713
Yeah, sure I do. He was integral.

359
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:34,007
He made 13 arrests.

360
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:36,009
Brought in a huge haul of fentanyl.

361
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:38,595
Yeah, we did a lot of good.

362
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,513
Could've done more.

363
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:42,180
How do you mean?

364
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,308
Well, we took down the big fish in LA,

365
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:46,561
but we were aiming for the sharks
across the border.

366
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:49,856
- Great White.
- [in Spanish] <i>Tiburón blanco.</i> Yeah.

367
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:52,358
It was the cartel bosses
that we really wanted.

368
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,610
- They slipped through.
- How?

369
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:57,071
Informant. They screwed us.

370
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,616
Eh, it was actually Driscoll
who cultivated the source.

371
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:02,784
He said he would tell us everything
we needed to know

372
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,912
if we would just get him out.

373
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:08,207
He had a girlfriend and a kid.
He just wanted a new life.

374
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,462
Do you happen to remember
the informant's name?

375
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:14,756
I-something.

376
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:17,633
Ibanez?

377
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:18,885
No. Ibarra.

378
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,386
- Luis Ibarra?
- Luis Ibarra.

379
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:22,597
- That's him.
- Uh-huh.

380
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,059
Boss, you're gonna want
to check this shit out.

381
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:30,812
Just, uh, before we go,
whatever happened to Ibarra?

382
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:32,064
How did he screw you?

383
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:33,149
He got cold feet.

384
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:35,068
Disappeared back to Mexico.

385
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:37,820
And you know that for sure?

386
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:40,281
Driscoll did. Yeah.

387
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,742
After the dude ghosted him, he
followed him all the way down to Jalisco.

388
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,912
Back across the border
until the trail went cold.

389
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:47,829
Ibarra's never surfaced since.

390
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,915
Hmm.

391
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:51,292
- Okay. Thank you.
- Yeah.

392
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:05,473
[Parker] Wow.

393
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:09,309
And Trejano didn't have any suspicions
on Driscoll?

394
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,687
No. Ibarra was gonna flip on the cartel.

395
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:15,065
So instead of protecting him,
Driscoll took him out.

396
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:18,026
Easy work given that
he was Ibarra's handler.

397
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:20,071
Yeah, well,
that's one way to handle things.

398
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:22,573
Yeah. Ibarra never had a chance.

399
00:21:23,658 --> 00:21:26,411
So twisted. Killing your own informant.

400
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:31,415
Driscoll's either incredibly reckless
or he thinks he can't be touched.

401
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:32,542
Or both.

402
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:35,628
The DEA didn't bat an eye at his story.

403
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:37,295
He must think he's Teflon.

404
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:40,008
He's not. We just have to find our way in.

405
00:21:40,842 --> 00:21:41,926
[sighs]

406
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:44,387
Then we grab him.

407
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:46,680
Rattle his cage. See what he gives.

408
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:48,640
That's risky.

409
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:51,060
Yeah. But if he's the first domino,
we gotta make him fall.

410
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:53,312
We only have one shot at this guy.

411
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:56,356
We can't bring him in
unless we have some leverage.

412
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:57,441
So first off,

413
00:21:57,442 --> 00:22:00,360
we have to nail down Driscoll's
whereabouts the day Ibarra was killed.

414
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:01,778
How do we manage that?

415
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:06,283
Figuring out where he was
on a random day five years ago?

416
00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:08,077
The past is always present, my friend.

417
00:22:11,748 --> 00:22:13,124
Let's dig in tomorrow.

418
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:16,960
I better get home
before Leo starts baking again. [sighs]

419
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:20,630
What he is doing is criminal.

420
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:24,677
- [chuckles] Good night.
- [Parker] Good night, Laffont.

421
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:33,186
So...

422
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:38,858
I've been thinking, you know,
since you told me about Olivas.

423
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,403
Reexamining things.

424
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:45,865
Seeing things in a... [sighs] ...new light.

425
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:49,869
- Yeah. Been there.
- Yeah.

426
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:52,579
Part of me just wants to leave it alone.

427
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,664
But, um... [sighs]

428
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:58,002
...something tells me
wondering might be worse.

429
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:01,422
[sighs] Why don't you come to my place?

430
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,632
Tutu made ribs.

431
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:04,884
We can talk there.

432
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:06,803
Okay.

433
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:15,519
I mean, incredible.
It fell right off the bone.

434
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,020
- Years of practice.
- [chuckles]

435
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:22,067
[chuckles] Believe it or not, this one
went vegan for a while. Drove me nuts.

436
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:24,487
You kidding. You love cheese.

437
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:27,197
I do.

438
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:28,448
[Tutu] Yeah. [sighs]

439
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:30,992
Imagine her mood after a month without it.

440
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:32,702
I nearly kicked her out of the house.

441
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:35,123
Would assume so. [laughs]

442
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:38,918
I think I'm gonna take Lola for a walk.

443
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:43,714
Thank you.
And no swimming after dark, you.

444
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:45,675
[Ballard, Parker chuckle]

445
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:48,093
- Lola.
- [Lola barks]

446
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:50,138
- Bye, baby girl. Good girl. Come on.
- [whines]

447
00:23:51,556 --> 00:23:52,765
[Tutu] All right. Let's go.

448
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:56,561
How long you've been living with her?

449
00:23:58,312 --> 00:23:59,689
Um... [sighs]

450
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:02,275
Gosh, I think it's two years now.

451
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:05,443
I'd just gotten out of a relationship,

452
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,654
and it was supposed
to be a short-term thing,

453
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:09,699
but then it just really worked.

454
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:11,700
I'm lucky to have her.

455
00:24:11,701 --> 00:24:12,952
[chuckles]

456
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:20,209
So, you said
you were reframing some things.

457
00:24:22,003 --> 00:24:23,004
Yeah.

458
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:25,756
Just wondering.

459
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:32,180
How did he get you alone?

460
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:41,814
Oh, boy.

461
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:45,568
We were at a bar.

462
00:24:47,445 --> 00:24:50,447
<i>Friend had made detective,
so we were celebrating.</i>

463
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:52,490
- Excuse me.
- [hip-hop music playing]

464
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,409
[Ballard] <i>We were having a great time.</i>

465
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,703
Here you go.

466
00:24:57,205 --> 00:24:59,206
Olivas was bringing me drinks.

467
00:24:59,207 --> 00:25:00,291
Doubles.

468
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:04,794
He said it was the smart move
because the bar was mobbed.

469
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:06,671
Come on.

470
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:08,382
Gotta toughen you up. [chuckles]

471
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:10,967
You got it. [chuckles]

472
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:12,053
[Olivas] Mmm.

473
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:14,347
- Mmm.
- Okay.

474
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:17,475
- [coughs] I'm getting used to it. [laughs]
- [Olivas] Okay. Okay.

475
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:19,517
[Parker] That is no joke.

476
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,394
[Ballard] <i>The drinks really hit me hard.</i>

477
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:26,442
And so I went to the bathroom
to splash water on my face...

478
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,153
[sighs] ...and he followed me in.

479
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:32,073
He said that he wanted to see
if I was okay.

480
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:36,159
[hip-hop music playing]

481
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,705
[Ballard] <i>When I pulled out my phone
to call an Uber...</i>

482
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:42,958
<i>he tried to take it from me.</i>

483
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:44,292
- [sighs]
- [Olivas] Hey. Hey.

484
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:46,003
[stammers] What are we doing?

485
00:25:46,504 --> 00:25:49,006
[scoffs] Do not waste your money.

486
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:53,051
- I will get you home any time.
- [chuckles]

487
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:55,929
[Ballard] <i>Said that he would
take me home himself.</i>

488
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,890
[Parker, Olivas chuckling]

489
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:03,729
I told him that it made no sense
to drive all the way to Malibu.

490
00:26:05,815 --> 00:26:08,317
When he couldn't convince me...

491
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:15,616
the whole nice guy act just disappeared.

492
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:21,789
[sighs] He slammed me into the door...

493
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:25,126
[inhales sharply, exhales]

494
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:28,045
Oh, I fought him.

495
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:30,589
[breathes shakily]

496
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,091
And it wasn't easy,

497
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:37,388
because he was dead set
on getting what he wanted.

498
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:43,060
But I finally got him off me, and I ran.

499
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:48,566
Straight out the door
into my partner, Chastain.

500
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:50,568
[scoffs]

501
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:57,366
Everything in RHD went downhill
from there.

502
00:27:01,037 --> 00:27:03,038
[inhales sharply, exhales]

503
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:08,044
[sniffles] A lot of that sounds...
[breathes shakily] ...really familiar.

504
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,343
[sniffles, sobs]

505
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:20,096
How did I not see it? [whimpers]

506
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:21,931
[cries]

507
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:23,976
[sighs] All this time.

508
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,064
[groans] All this time.

509
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,570
[sniffles] I thought, you know, I... [cries]

510
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:36,655
I didn't do enough.

511
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:40,910
I thought maybe I did too much.

512
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,246
I gave him mixed signals.

513
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:47,833
I don't know what I thought.

514
00:27:50,211 --> 00:27:51,295
I just...

515
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:54,548
[sighs] I thought it was on me.

516
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:01,680
[Ballard]
I heard in therapy once that, uh...

517
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:07,520
"If you're assaulted by a stranger,
you don't trust the world.

518
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:11,440
But if you're assaulted
by someone you know,

519
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:14,902
you don't trust yourself."

520
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:22,534
[Parker breathes shakily]

521
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:23,619
You said that...

522
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:28,666
...most of it sounded familiar.
What was different?

523
00:28:38,968 --> 00:28:40,845
- [Olivas] Watch your head.
- [Parker chuckles]

524
00:28:41,804 --> 00:28:42,805
[door closes]

525
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:45,933
[sighs]

526
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:48,477
[sighs]

527
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:53,274
Hey, I got you, partner.

528
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:57,402
[Parker breathes shakily]

529
00:28:57,403 --> 00:28:58,946
<i>I let him take me home.</i>

530
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:05,119
[sobs]

531
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:11,292
[sobbing continues]

532
00:29:12,877 --> 00:29:14,378
[sniffles]

533
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:18,340
You didn't let him do anything.

534
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:37,651
[phone buzzing]

535
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:41,529
Tell me something good. [sighs]

536
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:44,032
[Laffont] <i>I don't think
I can help you there.</i>

537
00:29:44,033 --> 00:29:48,995
I just looked into the GND logs
on the day Luis Ibarra died.

538
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:51,998
Anthony Driscoll was signed out
to Division 106 that day.

539
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:53,876
The son of a bitch was in court.

540
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:57,545
Wait a minute. Cops claim court
like schoolboys claim stomachaches.

541
00:29:57,546 --> 00:30:01,467
- Remember that time you--
- I was not gonna miss Rihanna in Vegas.

542
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,886
Well, look,
before we let this guy off the hook,

543
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:07,847
let's make damn sure he was
actually in court that day.

544
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:09,891
How are we gonna do that
without raising flags?

545
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:13,187
Even asking the court liaison feels risky.

546
00:30:14,772 --> 00:30:15,898
I have an idea.

547
00:30:20,194 --> 00:30:23,404
Ooh. Someone's glowing this morning.

548
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:25,282
- Thank you.
- [Colleen chuckles]

549
00:30:26,784 --> 00:30:28,077
Who's the guy?

550
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:31,955
Just 'cause I woke up in a good mood
does not mean a boy is involved.

551
00:30:31,956 --> 00:30:33,040
Whatever.

552
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:35,209
I was just agreeing.

553
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:37,794
But...

554
00:30:37,795 --> 00:30:39,754
[whispers] ...maybe this time
there is a boy.

555
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:42,090
- [whispers] Ooh. Details later.
- Yeah.

556
00:30:42,091 --> 00:30:43,801
- [phone chimes]
- Oh.

557
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:46,929
Guys. I heard back from NICB.

558
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:52,892
Jenny Garrison's van was crushed in 2009
at a place called R&T Scrapyard.

559
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:54,394
I knew this van would take us places.

560
00:30:54,395 --> 00:30:56,479
And where's it taking us exactly?

561
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,691
Encino. That's where the scrapyard is.
We should go while traffic's light.

562
00:30:59,692 --> 00:31:02,193
Encino? Ugh. I'll swing by on my way home.

563
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:04,445
Nope. I did the digging.
I'm going with you.

564
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:06,906
If Mike's our killer,
we need a lead on him.

565
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:08,701
And so far, this van's all we got.

566
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,874
[groans] Great.

567
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:26,385
This takes me back.

568
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:28,762
Do I wanna ask where?

569
00:31:29,263 --> 00:31:30,347
Carolina Crusher.

570
00:31:31,015 --> 00:31:33,434
Winter Nationals, uh, 2005.

571
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:35,394
[Ted chuckles]

572
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:40,524
[chuckles] Oh, hang on.
You're into monster trucks?

573
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:42,610
I contain multitudes, Ted.

574
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,540
We're looking for anything you might have

575
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:59,667
on a vehicle that was crushed here
back in '09.

576
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:02,295
Yeah. We just need copies
of any relevant paperwork.

577
00:32:02,296 --> 00:32:04,088
Or-Or better yet, email.

578
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,173
Save those trees.

579
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:06,925
[chuckles] What?

580
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,970
That's where all the old records are.

581
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:12,056
Knock yourselves out.

582
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,853
[video game beeps]

583
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:23,400
You have got to be kidding me.

584
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:25,569
[Colleen] Good heavens.

585
00:32:26,195 --> 00:32:29,156
It'll be a miracle if we find anything
in this trash heap.

586
00:32:29,907 --> 00:32:32,533
Where's your sense
of wonder and curiosity?

587
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:35,828
No. Not... Not...
Not in a place that looks like this.

588
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:37,915
Come on. You... You like to fish, right?

589
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:40,583
- What's that have to do with anything?
- When you fish,

590
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:43,503
you throw out a line
and you see if anything bites.

591
00:32:43,504 --> 00:32:46,047
Sometimes it does,
sometimes it doesn't. [chuckles]

592
00:32:46,048 --> 00:32:48,716
But someone who enjoys it
likes it either way.

593
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:51,512
That's why it's called fishing,
not catching.

594
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:54,889
[sighs]

595
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,265
Oh, okay.

596
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:58,644
- [blows] Oh.
- Jeez. God.

597
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:02,481
[attorney] And how does this witness list
connect to the conspiracy Javi gave you?

598
00:33:03,065 --> 00:33:06,693
Well, he didn't give me anything
that would make my case, so I'm looking.

599
00:33:06,694 --> 00:33:08,112
Looking for?

600
00:33:10,406 --> 00:33:11,572
All right, fine.

601
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:15,911
But I want it on record that getting you
this witness list is me doing you a favor.

602
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:18,037
Noted.

603
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:19,580
For real, Ballard.

604
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:22,668
If you're not gonna tell me what's up,
then what's in it for me?

605
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:25,546
What? I got you a boba.

606
00:33:28,382 --> 00:33:32,219
If I find what I'm looking for,
it could help your client.

607
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:49,527
[gasps]

608
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:51,280
That's it? Did you find the name?

609
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:54,366
Nope. Which is exactly
what I was hoping for.

610
00:33:56,118 --> 00:33:57,119
[scoffs]

611
00:34:00,748 --> 00:34:02,373
- Driscoll's back on the board.
- [Laffont] <i>How?</i>

612
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:04,208
I just reviewed the LA County witness list

613
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:06,252
for the day that Driscoll claimed
to be in court.

614
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:09,756
His name doesn't appear anywhere.
No subpoenas. No testimonies. Nothing.

615
00:34:09,757 --> 00:34:11,340
He fabricated an alibi.

616
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:13,760
This guy fucking killed Ibarra.

617
00:34:13,761 --> 00:34:15,721
I know it. [sighs]

618
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:19,600
[Ted] Okay, let's see.

619
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:22,978
[groans]

620
00:34:30,319 --> 00:34:31,737
[groans, sighs]

621
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:35,032
- [Colleen] Okay.
- [Ted] So... [mutters]

622
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:54,301
I found it.

623
00:34:57,971 --> 00:34:59,097
I found our van.

624
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,355
Not a lot to go on here.

625
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:12,069
Your negativity
is bad for your health and mine.

626
00:35:14,947 --> 00:35:18,367
Van was towed here
from a storage facility on Oxnard.

627
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:23,246
- Come on.
- Oh, you wanna go there now?

628
00:35:23,247 --> 00:35:25,456
- Oh, you bet your behind I do.
- [chuckles]

629
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:28,001
- This is our first nibble.
- You and your rabbit holes.

630
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:37,260
This is where the magic happens.

631
00:35:37,261 --> 00:35:40,180
We get a lead, catch a break,
run into a dead end.

632
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,016
This is where we figure it out.

633
00:35:43,851 --> 00:35:44,852
[chuckles]

634
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:46,978
[partner] This is dope.

635
00:35:46,979 --> 00:35:50,858
This definitely beats getting dispatched
to check on barking dogs.

636
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:52,943
Dogs?

637
00:35:53,694 --> 00:35:54,695
Seriously?

638
00:35:55,821 --> 00:35:57,321
"To protect and to serve."

639
00:35:57,322 --> 00:36:00,032
Hmm. No wonder you wanna make detective.

640
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:01,159
One day soon.

641
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:06,205
Sarah's case is the main reason
our unit's even here.

642
00:36:06,206 --> 00:36:08,583
Well, I hope the guy gets
what's coming to him.

643
00:36:08,584 --> 00:36:11,044
- If we find him.
- When you find him.

644
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:14,381
And your John Doe case?

645
00:36:15,215 --> 00:36:18,552
Where the hell did you even start when
you didn't know the victim's identity?

646
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:23,390
Well, actually, it was my idea that led us
to figure out who he was.

647
00:36:24,725 --> 00:36:26,726
Damn, girl. [chuckles]

648
00:36:26,727 --> 00:36:28,644
Well, maybe you could teach me
a thing or two.

649
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:30,314
It didn't lead us anywhere though.

650
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:34,568
We found the gun, but it led us to a guy
with an airtight alibi.

651
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:36,695
Still.

652
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:39,197
I'm impressed.

653
00:36:40,157 --> 00:36:41,532
[chuckles]

654
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:42,992
[line ringing]

655
00:36:42,993 --> 00:36:44,994
[Parker, on voice mail]
<i>It's Zamira. You know what to do.</i>

656
00:36:44,995 --> 00:36:47,455
- [voice mail beeps]
- Hey, Parker. It's Ballard. [sighs]

657
00:36:47,456 --> 00:36:50,041
Just calling to check on you,
see how you're doing.

658
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:53,210
Uh, big news on the Driscoll front,
so give me a call back, all right?

659
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,296
[mouthing] Bye.

660
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:33,043
[cries]

661
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,421
[grunts]

662
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,467
[screaming, crying]

663
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,478
[screams]

664
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:58,443
[breathing shakily]

665
00:38:41,695 --> 00:38:43,697
[car approaching]

666
00:39:04,176 --> 00:39:08,138
Some day, we're gonna make such
a mess of this place, we'll all be gone.

667
00:39:09,473 --> 00:39:11,349
It'll go back to the coyotes.

668
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:15,479
What do you got for me? [sighs]

669
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:23,152
- Case is dead in the water.
- You sure?

670
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:26,072
They got no leads, no suspects.

671
00:39:26,073 --> 00:39:28,491
Whole department's bankrolled
by that city councilman,

672
00:39:28,492 --> 00:39:29,826
the one with the dead sister.

673
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:31,912
That's what they're focused on.

674
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:35,791
Wow. [sighs] You are sure.

675
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:39,460
You're young,
maybe you don't know how this works.

676
00:39:39,461 --> 00:39:41,796
But they're right outside,
looking for cracks.

677
00:39:41,797 --> 00:39:44,548
I'm telling you. I don't think
there's anything for us to worry about.

678
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:47,635
You're asking your friend questions,
being nice about it. I appreciate that.

679
00:39:47,636 --> 00:39:49,178
[stammers] I'm not a monster.

680
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:52,265
And I see the appeal,
believe me. Pretty face.

681
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,768
The guys we work with...

682
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,104
they don't care about that.

683
00:39:58,105 --> 00:40:00,440
They don't care about being nice.

684
00:40:02,526 --> 00:40:04,777
One of them is up here talking to you
instead of me.

685
00:40:04,778 --> 00:40:05,861
[tense music plays]

686
00:40:05,862 --> 00:40:08,740
They might want you to twist her arm
a little more, or they might want me to.

687
00:40:09,825 --> 00:40:11,910
Like I said, I'm not a monster. [sighs]

688
00:40:12,661 --> 00:40:14,121
But I also do what they tell me.

689
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:17,415
And she may not be so pretty then.

690
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:21,711
But it's not gonna come to that, right?

691
00:40:23,463 --> 00:40:24,464
You won't let it.

692
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:34,599
[car door opens]

693
00:40:35,851 --> 00:40:37,185
[car door closes]

694
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:40,605
[car engine starts]

695
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:51,073
Um... Okay. Our records do show a van
was towed in 2009 from unit E36.

696
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:53,368
Belongs to a Mike Garrison.

697
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:59,415
Uh. Wait. Wait. Uh. Belongs?
He-He still uses it?

698
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:02,001
Uh. [chuckles]
Lucky duck locked in an old rate.

699
00:41:02,002 --> 00:41:04,587
Paying a third of the rest
of our customers.

700
00:41:04,588 --> 00:41:05,754
[gasps]

701
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:09,301
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
We-We hooked a big one.

702
00:41:11,887 --> 00:41:13,012
[sighs]

703
00:41:13,013 --> 00:41:15,306
Uh, Ballard. Um... [stammers]

704
00:41:15,307 --> 00:41:16,808
We're gonna need a warrant.

705
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:19,352
[tires squealing]

706
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:37,745
She's on her way.
She'll be here any minute.

707
00:41:37,746 --> 00:41:38,997
So you keep saying.

708
00:41:40,624 --> 00:41:42,082
It's nice of you to join us, by the way.

709
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:44,002
Oh, I don't miss the fun stuff.

710
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,712
[sighs]

711
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:49,006
Seriously, I got a family.

712
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:51,425
It's time for me to go.
Which means it's time for you to--

713
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:52,510
[car approaches]

714
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:55,138
- [manager sighs]
- [car door closes]

715
00:41:55,764 --> 00:41:57,933
Got a couple of black-and-whites
standing by.

716
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:01,978
Hey. I got your text.

717
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:04,689
- Glad you made it.
- [manager sighs] Follow me.

718
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:08,609
Did we get anything new on Garrison?
Like an address?

719
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:09,693
Uh, no such luck.

720
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:13,156
Apparently, the unit's paid for in cash
via drop box, once a year.

721
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:16,742
Yeah. I asked about the cameras.
They roll over every 30 days.

722
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:18,787
[Laffont] Well, let's hope
he came by recently.

723
00:42:19,788 --> 00:42:21,289
Ooh. This feels big.

724
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:24,251
[manager] Here it is. Locker 36.

725
00:42:24,918 --> 00:42:26,460
It's because you followed your gut.

726
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:28,004
[chattering on radio]

727
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,260
[sighs] Let's cut it.

728
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:52,821
Here we go.

729
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:05,667
[breathes shakily]

730
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:13,508
[Colleen] Oh, dear.

731
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,260
What do you think are in these?

732
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:17,804
[Laffont] Could be anything.

733
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:20,889
Photographs.

734
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:22,434
Body parts.

735
00:43:42,037 --> 00:43:43,288
Holy shit.

736
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:45,749
It's Laura Wilson's.

737
00:43:56,885 --> 00:43:59,179
They're like little coffins.

738
00:44:01,306 --> 00:44:02,389
This is sick.

739
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:03,975
[tense music plays]

740
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:06,853
It is.

741
00:44:07,687 --> 00:44:08,772
And it stops here.
