Cops can be assholes.
Doesn't make it personal.

3
00:00:04,964 --> 00:00:07,090
You were my partner,
and I should've had your back.

4
00:00:07,091 --> 00:00:09,134
I wasn't just your partner.
I was your friend.

5
00:00:09,135 --> 00:00:10,886
- I just--
- No, get off me!

00:00:11,846 --> 00:00:13,889
[Tutu] <i>You keep putting these walls
up around yourself.</i>

7
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:15,891
You're the one missing the view.

8
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:19,853
[Bosch] <i>Harmon Harris.
He and this other guy, Adam Lennox,</i>

9
00:00:19,854 --> 00:00:22,188
<i>they said that they'd
been out together that night.</i>

10
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:26,526
Ironically, this guy Lennox was
a student in Harris's acting class.

11
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:28,903
[Ballard] <i>Sarah Pearlman
was interested in acting.</i>

12
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:30,864
Maybe Harmon Harris coached her too.

13
00:00:30,865 --> 00:00:31,948
Good a lead as any.

14
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,491
Dispo order? Who signed for it?

15
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:34,826
[Ballard] <i>Guy named Charlie Grant.</i>

16
00:00:34,827 --> 00:00:37,036
He worked Gangs with Laffont
back in the day. [sighs]

17
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,246
So I'm gonna be roping him in.

18
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:39,497
Is that a good idea?

19
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:42,876
What am I supposed to know
about some illegal getting whacked?

20
00:00:42,877 --> 00:00:45,211
The bullet that killed him
is missing from Property,

21
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:46,671
and you signed the dispo order.

22
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:50,216
You know she has a habit
of making false accusations,

23
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:52,635
and almost ruined a good man's career.

24
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:55,764
[Colleen] <i>Who would order a bullet
to be destroyed in an unsolved murder?</i>

25
00:00:55,765 --> 00:00:58,476
[Parker] <i>Look, it's one thing
to let a John Doe go unsolved.</i>

26
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,895
But they destroyed the damn evidence?

27
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:02,395
This is a cover-up.

28
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,230
Why can't you see
what's right in front of you?

29
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:05,357
You wanna help me?

30
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:07,234
Get your goddamn badge.

31
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:09,235
[Parker] <i>Paw Paw, I wanna go back.</i>

32
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:10,696
It's rotten.

33
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:14,491
I struggled to find a reason to stay.

34
00:01:14,492 --> 00:01:15,575
[Parker] Then why did you?

35
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:18,912
When you knew what your so-called brothers
were capable of?

36
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:21,749
[Grandaddy Parker]
<i>Because once you know that,</i>

37
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:25,920
<i>someone has to watch the watchmen.</i>

38
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:47,148
Gonna be near impossible
investigating potential corruption

39
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:48,901
without stepping on a land mine.

40
00:01:49,527 --> 00:01:51,694
- So, we should just ignore it?
- That's not what he's saying.

41
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:55,990
I'm just saying, given the circumstances,
we might need more firepower.

42
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:56,908
[Parker] <i>What we need</i>

43
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:59,828

44

[Ballard] <i>No Berchem.</i>

00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:02,121
<i>And definitely no IA.</i>

46
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,332
<i>Look, this doesn't work
unless we're all on the same page.</i>

47
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,793
You need to start trusting me.

48
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:13,258
[sighs] No one knows about this
until we figure out what's going on.

49
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:15,134
<i>And that includes the squad.</i>

50
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,011
<i>As far as they're concerned,
this is a John Doe murder</i>

51
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:18,430
<i>until we can prove corruption.</i>

52
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:22,058
[Parker] <i>Gonna be hard to do.
We don't have a bullet to work off of.</i>

[phone beeps]

54
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,438
That may not be the case.

55
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,607
What do you mean?

56
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:31,234
Head back to the Ahmanson.
Martina can fill you in.

57
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:32,528
Fill me in on what?

58
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,613
We may get that bullet after all.

00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:50,462
I just hope we don't stall out here.

62
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:53,047
So, Adam Lennox.

63
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:56,342
What was Bosch's take on him
during the initial investigation?

64
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:59,012
He thought he was covering for
Harmon Harris. Just couldn't figure why.

65
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:00,096
- [bell rings]
- [director] Quiet on set.

66
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:02,098
Maybe now that he's dead,
he'll give it up.

67
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,308
Gotta love LA.

00:03:03,309 --> 00:03:04,559
[scoffs]

69
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,186
So, how do we find Adam?

70
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,688
You said he works in craft service.

71
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:09,940

Can I help you?

74
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:20,116
- You're Dolores, right?
- Yes.

75
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:22,911
I understand that you knew Yulia Kravetz.

76
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:24,746
I wanted to ask you
a couple of questions about--

77
00:03:24,747 --> 00:03:27,457
You police?
I thought you got the guy who did it.

78
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,542
Oh. [stutters] I'm just a volunteer.

79
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,503
Uh... And I'm not here
about the investigation.

80
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:33,713
I know Yulia came from Ukraine,

81
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:36,466
and I wanna find her family,
let them know what happened.

82
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:39,677
I'm sorry.
I didn't know much about her family.

83
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:40,763
Hmm.

84
00:03:41,347 --> 00:03:44,642
Did she ever say their names maybe,
or what town she was from?

85
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:47,770
She didn't talk about home.
It made her sad.

86
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,313
She missed the coffee though.

87
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:53,359
Wherever she was from,
they were famous for it.

88
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:56,987
Adam Lennox?

89
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:59,572
I'm Detective Ballard, LAPD.

90
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:02,576
I have some questions for you about
an old friend of yours, Harmon Harris.

91
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,161
Harmon?

92
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,622
He died two years ago.

93
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:11,334
You alibied for him back in '08
in the Laura Wilson murder, that right?

94
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:13,503
Yeah. I told the detective back then

95
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:15,797
that he'd be crazy to think
Harmon could do something like that.

96
00:04:15,798 --> 00:04:17,383
That would be Detective Bosch?

97
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,010
Uh, forget his name.
Super intense guy though.

98
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:23,304
Yeah. That would be Detective Bosch.

99
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:24,890
So, you were with Harmon all night?

100
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,934
I thought we settled all this.

101
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:30,187
It's not settled
until Laura's killer is found.

102
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:34,900
Look, I know it wasn't Harmon, okay?

103
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:36,485
He was a decent guy.

104
00:04:36,986 --> 00:04:38,945
He took care of a lot of people back then.

105
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:41,323
Must've been hard to lose him then.

106
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,785
And Laura too. She was so young.

107
00:04:46,704 --> 00:04:48,038
Whole thing was a nightmare.

108
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:51,041
But it wasn't Harmon.

109
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:53,711
Tell us how you know.

110
00:04:56,755 --> 00:05:00,592
Okay, look, I was covering for him.
But not because he killed Laura.

111
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,805
He was with another guy.

112
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,183
Intimately.

113
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:09,852
And Harmon wasn't out?

114
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:13,354
Harmon didn't care who knew about him
or what people thought. [chuckles]

115
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,441
He was covering for the other guy?

116
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,151
We both were.

117
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:20,236
This guy's career just started
to really take off.

118
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:21,947
Outing him would've ended all that.

119
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,034
So I said it was me.

120
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:28,453
We're going to need the name
of Harmon's actual alibi.

121
00:05:28,454 --> 00:05:29,454
I can't do that.

122
00:05:29,455 --> 00:05:31,497
Mr. Lennox,
we're talking about murder here.

123
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:32,832
[glass shatters]

124
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,711
Phil? [stammers] One second.

125
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:40,506
We need that name.

126
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,634
Do we? Right now?

127
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:46,095
And add this actor
to the list of casualties?

128
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,765
If Harmon is our killer, then he's dead.

129
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:50,892
Why not try to prove it some other way,

130
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:54,271
see if we can avoid
any other collateral damage?

131
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:57,649
We can always come back to him
if we have to.

132
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:01,527
- All right.
- [Adam] Look, guys,

133
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,696
- I should really be getting back to--
- Wait. One more question.

134
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,532
About the van you saw outside of Laura's,
a few nights before the murder?

135
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:11,913
Yeah, um, license plate started with a 4.
It was a blue Ford. It was a beater.

136
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:13,248
Wait. It was a Ford?

137
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,834
- [Adam] Mm-hmm.
- It didn't say that in the report.

138
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:18,337
Funny.

139
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,838
I wouldn't have known that back then.

140
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:24,133
[stammers] My brother-in-law bought one
just like it a couple years ago.

141
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,385
Definitely a Ford.

142
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:29,972
Yesterday on the Pearlman case,
this was our list.

143
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:33,769
Over 3,000 blue vans that matched
the description in Bosch's murder book.

144
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:38,356
Today, we have narrowed it down
to 378 blue Ford vans.

145
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:39,816
Ooh, a smaller haystack!

146
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:41,317
[Ballard] Split up these VIN numbers.

147
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,611
Look for criminal records
or anything else that may be a flag.

148
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:45,864
- On our John Doe case, we--
- I have a lead.

149
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,617
All right, show 'em.

150
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:55,916
Mmm. I, um, hate to be that guy,
but what are we looking at?

151
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,960
Well, thanks to Martina
and one of her classmates,

152
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:01,796
that is the John Doe bullet
that was destroyed.

153
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:03,422
How did you get this?

154
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,134
I promised him I'd go to
a <i>Lord of the Rings</i> marathon.

155
00:07:06,135 --> 00:07:07,218
I don't think he meant--

156
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:09,887
Yeah. They used photos of the bullet
from the John Doe autopsy.

157
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:12,598
Right. My friend, he interns at a place

158
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:15,351
that builds renderings
of crime scene evidence for lawyers.

159
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:16,894
[Ted] Oh, that's cool.

160
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,479
It won't hold up in court.

161
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,731
It doesn't have to. Just need a lead.

162
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:22,316
Now I can take this to Firearms Freddie

163
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,236
and see if he can connect it
to any other crimes.

164
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,156
- [music playing on radio]
- You mind the radio?

165
00:07:28,157 --> 00:07:30,992
As you can see,
I'm not exactly Bluetooth-capable in here.

166
00:07:30,993 --> 00:07:33,494
My mom says the day
they started putting computers in cars

167
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:34,872
is the day it all went to hell.

168
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:38,125
You tell her yet,
that you joined the reserves?

169
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:40,878
Yeah, that's a problem for future me.

170
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:45,090
- Look, about this morning, I...
- I know I got a little hot.

171
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:49,720
You're just making some moves
I didn't expect.

172
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:52,306
Like Laffont?

173
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,807
I know you trust him, but...

174
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,018
Look, he's like this car.

175
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,020
He's more reliable than he looks.

176
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,566
I'll try.

177
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:11,617
[Ted] Last five of the VIN are 11298.

178
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,244
I'd rather not hold.

179
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,245
[stammers, sighs]

180
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:17,622
[music playing on headphones]

181
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:18,707
[Colleen] Martina?

182
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,125
Martina?

183
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,127
[music continues]

184
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:24,254
Martina?

185
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,089
[gasps, in Spanish] <i>Ay, dios.</i>

186
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,341
[sighs]

187
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:30,551
Sorry. These are my heavy-duty ones.

188
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:33,179
The brain's not braining very well today.
What's up?

189
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,972
I think I have something.

190
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:37,934
Slogging through these VIN numbers
didn't seem particularly efficient,

191
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:40,353
so I lobbed some details
about the Laura Wilson killing

192
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:42,521
- over to some murder buddies on Reddit.
- Naturally.

193
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,191
And this user named
HootDunIt reached out--

194
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:46,817
Did you say "HootDunIt"?

195
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:49,446
Yeah. HootDunIt. You know, the owl theory?

196
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:51,782
<i>The Staircase</i>?

197
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:57,536
[stammers] Anyway, uh, Hoot messaged me
about a homicide in Vegas in '98.

198
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:01,166
Had some of the same deets,
including a blue Ford van.

199
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:04,962
Astonishingly accurate.

200
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:07,464
You know AI is gonna take our jobs, right?

201
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,341
And then it's gonna kill us in our beds.

202
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:13,095
Can you run it through NIBIN
without destroying the world?

203
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,597
For a Florida Ghost Philodendron.
Just a cutting.

204
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:17,683
Done.

205
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:19,726
Long as you can do it right now.

206
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:26,524
"Kathy Goodman, 27,
was on vacation in Vegas.

207
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:27,858
Seen at the Tropicana"--

208
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:29,193
[Ted] Oh, Tropicana.

209
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,738
The first swim-up blackjack table
in Nevada.

210
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:34,282
How's your VIN list coming?

211
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:35,409
Ugh.

212
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:38,829
Single woman, traveling alone.

213
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,664
Strangled to death in her motel.

214
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:44,751
Blue Ford van spotted outside
the night she died.

215
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,627
This could be our guy.

216
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:50,089
I should call Vegas PD, right?
See if they'll send the murder book?

217
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,967
You can't actually.

218
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:56,555
It needs to be someone with a badge.

219
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:02,185
What?

220
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:05,188
- You can bribe him.
- Ding, ding, ding. We got one.

221
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:10,401
Incident within the last five years?

222
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:13,821
Southeast Division case
from November 2023.

223
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:16,533
A suspect named... [sighs] ...Javier Fuentes.

224
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,409
Charges?

225
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:23,665
Uh, "Gang member in possession of
a loaded firearm, discharging a firearm."

226
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,667
Could be he's still in custody.

227
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,503
Maybe we can keep him there for murder.

228
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:34,592
You're right. Strangled in her bed
just like Laura and Sarah.

229
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:35,676
Could be a third victim.

230
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:37,553
Gotta get into the murder book
to be certain.

231
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:40,599
[stutters] I reached out to the captain
in Vegas. He's sending it over.

232
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:42,642
And, um... [stammers]

233
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,270
Colleen's the one who figured it out.

234
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:47,980
Colleen, go ahead.

235
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:52,026
[stammers] Rawls is right.
Uh, we need confirmation.

236
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:54,737
But if we work under the assumption
that it is the same killer,

237
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:58,366
we can assume that the van
was manufactured before 1998,

238
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:04,831
which narrows the amount of vans
that we have to track from 378 to, uh, 54.

239
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,501
Let's bump up the 54. And show me
the Vegas book when it gets here.

240
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:09,585
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

241
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:10,670
[Ballard] Great job.

242
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:18,636
Hey. Did Parker tell you we got a hit
on that John Doe dummy bullet?

243
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:21,306
Guy's name is Javier Fuentes.
He's actually still in county.

244
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,308
- That's great.
- Yeah.

245
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:25,560
[clears throat] Um...

246
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:28,480
Listen.

247
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:30,732
- Uh...
- What's up?

248
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:33,026
It's about Chastain.

249
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:35,820
Is he calling you now?

250
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:38,197
Because he approached me outside
of Patrick's Roadhouse the other--

251
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,282
No, no. Renée...

252
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,077
there was a car accident.

253
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:44,246
Chastain is dead.

254
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,125
No one else was injured.

255
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:52,546
He just hit a telephone pole.

256
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:03,598
Let's get back to work.

257
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:24,953
["Speak Your Mind" playing on radio]

258
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:36,297
[Aaron] Starting to take shape.

259
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:37,382
Hey.

260
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:39,634
Uh, you're early.

261
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:42,053
Oh, am I? It's nine o'clock.

262
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:45,891
It is. I lost track of time.

263
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:48,143
- I'll take one of those.
- Oh.

264
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:54,483
Aw, look at you. Same goofy smile.

265
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:56,775
Is that your dad?

266
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:57,861
Yeah.

267
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:01,031
Is he still around?

268
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,783
No, he died when I was 14.

269
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,411
Surfing accident.

270
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:12,417
And Dr. Tutu in there thought it would be
cathartic for me to build his board, so...

271
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,004
Ah, 14. That's young.

272
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:19,758
Yeah.

273
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,843
Just one of those things, you know?

274
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:24,137
It's always there.

275
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:26,890
[song continues]

276
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,073
[Ballard] You picked up your badge.

277
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:46,284
Yeah, I'm official now.

278
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:51,915
Hey. I heard about your old partner.

279
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:53,959
That's rough.

280
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:56,711
How long were you guys working together?

281
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:58,213
Four years.

282
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:04,094
Put me this close to <i>chocha</i>,
you expect me to think straight?

283
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:06,679
Mr. Fuentes, you were arrested in--

284
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,558
Call me Little Javi.
I wanna hear it come outta your mouth.

285
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:15,437
You were arrested for possession and
discharge of a firearm, November, 2023.

286
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:19,526
Parole violation and time served
if I ever get in front of a judge.

287
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:23,821
Maybe. Except we've just
connected that gun to a murder.

288
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:24,906
[smacks lips]

289
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:29,786
No comeback for that?

290
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:40,212
Hold up.

291
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:41,298
Him?

292
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:44,300
- You know him?
- [stammers] No, no, no, no.

293
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:46,427
There's no way I'm doing time
for someone else's shit.

294
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:49,763
I walked in here on two legs, and I got
jumped over a plate of mashed potatoes!

295
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:51,683
If you didn't do it,
where'd you get the gun?

296
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:56,062
I don't remember. [stammers] I found it.

297
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:02,318
All I know is I didn't kill that dude.
[stammers] I wouldn't go near him.

298
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:03,612
Why? Who is he?

299
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,199
He's a coyote for the cartel.

300
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,285
[Ballard] Which one?

301
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:15,874
Tell us, or your name starts coming out
of our mouths on the streets...

302
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:18,376
Little Javi.

303
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:25,050
Zacatecas Nuevas.

304
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,136
Okay. Now tell me who that is.

305
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:36,144
Pending confirmation,
we no longer have a John Doe.

306
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:40,731
So our undocumented father on the run
was a coyote? I'm stunned.

307
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:43,276
Doesn't change the job. Solve the murder.

308
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:48,072
What about that guy in jail
who got caught with the gun?

309
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:49,198
Oh, he didn't do it.

310
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,283
- That your woo-woo talking?
- [chuckles] No.

311
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,576
He had an alibi.

312
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:55,205
Javier was on a job in Fresno
at the time Ibarra was killed.

313
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:57,164
Got the gun afterward.

314
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:59,708
- So he's off the board.
- Great.

315
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:02,503
It's still progress, guys,
because of Martina's bullet.

316
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:04,381
If I were giving out stickers,
she'd get two.

317
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:07,008
Hey. Do we have the murder book
on the Tropicana victim?

318
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:09,551
Yeah, but it's pretty thin.

319
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,845
Nothing concrete linking her
to our killer.

320
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:12,931
Let me have a look.

321
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,309
And, guys, let's keep
moving on those vans.

322
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:20,480
Hey, Ballard,
I heard the funeral is tomorrow.

323
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:24,192
I guess his wife wanted
to get it over with.

324
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:25,777
You going?

325
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,071
You know, we got a lot going on. I'll see.

326
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:31,241
[sighs]

327
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:38,956
You bring that in?

328
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:41,876
Yep. Trying to warm this place up a bit.

329
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,379
My next project is the conference room.

330
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:54,096
Uh, hey. Are you, uh, still looking
for that Ukrainian girl's parents?

331
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:55,974
Yes, but I'm striking out.

332
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:58,976
I actually think I've reached
the end of the Internet. [chuckles]

333
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:01,395
[chuckles] That's saying a lot
coming from you.

334
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:04,440
Yeah. I think I found the town
that she's from.

335
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:06,942
They have a coffee company
that won an award.

336
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:10,821
- They grow coffee in Ukraine?
- Yeah. They roast coffee in Ukraine.

337
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:13,824
Anyway, I can't reach anybody over there.

338
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:16,326
It's like... [smacks lips]
Uh, it's like a black hole.

339
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:17,703
Yeah.

340
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:20,956
[stammers] You know,
one of my security guys, Andrei.

341
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:24,127
He's from Kyiv. Ex-military.

00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,165
- Let's hope.
- Mmm.

512
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:07,376
Interesting choice of venue.

513
00:27:08,002 --> 00:27:09,002
Yeah, no cops.

514
00:27:09,003 --> 00:27:11,005
And they make a killer Singapore sling.

515
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:13,257
Okay. Guys, where do we go from here?

516
00:27:14,008 --> 00:27:15,216
Javi's intel is holding up,

517
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:17,636
but it's not getting us any closer
to who killed our John Doe.

518
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:20,973
I think we should track down
Ibarra's family ourselves.

519
00:27:21,474 --> 00:27:24,309
They may know something.
We can't count on the Federales.

520
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,312
- So tomorrow, why don't we do first--
- Tomorrow?

521
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:27,897
Tomorrow, you're out, right?

522
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:29,565
Why?

523
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:31,442
The funeral.

524
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,946
I don't know if I'm going to that.

525
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:38,657
He was your partner.

526
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:42,328
You shouldn't let those RHD assholes
keep you away.

527
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:44,663
She's right.

528
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:47,916
Whatever the baggage,
you'll regret it if you don't go.

529
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:49,335
All right. [sighs]

530
00:27:50,753 --> 00:27:53,088
- [Laffont] Ballard.
- [sighs] Sorry. I didn't mean to pry.

531
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:54,381
I just was...

532
00:27:54,382 --> 00:27:55,758
It's all good. Fine.

533
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,807
[sighs, smacks lips]

534
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:05,393
[mournful music plays]

535
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:10,291
[Olivas] You two made a great team.

536
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:14,086
Just came by to offer my condolences.

537
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:17,214
{\an8}Never lost a partner. I can't imagine.

538
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:19,884
[Laffont] Saved us some seats over here.

539
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:22,761
Robert.

540
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:25,139
Hey, Tom.

541
00:29:28,017 --> 00:29:29,018
Renée.

542
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:35,274
I didn't know you were coming.

543
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:37,526
Blame her.

544
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,531
She thought you could use
some solidarity today.

545
00:30:02,051 --> 00:30:03,635
[Barrel] <i>As most of you know,</i>

546
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:08,599
<i>Ken Chastain was my boot detective
just a thousand years ago.</i>

547
00:30:10,226 --> 00:30:12,519
<i>First day I met him, Captain called me in.</i>

548
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,104
<i>I'm expecting to meet my new partner.</i>

549
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:17,191
And there was this kid.

550
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:22,488
Baby face, wide eyes,
ready to fight for the good in the world.

551
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:29,202
I thought to myself, "How in the hell
did this mook make detective?"

552
00:30:29,203 --> 00:30:30,745
[mourners laugh]

553
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:35,166
[Barrel] Well, pretty quickly
I found out that he had the stuff.

554
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:37,545
No doubt, the guy was a goofball.

555
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:43,383
But we all know that
that goofball act is vital

556
00:30:43,384 --> 00:30:46,219
to how we survive doing this job.

557
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:50,682
It's how we look past that line
of life and death

558
00:30:50,683 --> 00:30:53,811
that we all walk every day.

559
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:59,023
Ken Chastain could always be depended on.

560
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:02,735
When things got bad,
he was the guy you wanted in your corner.

561
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:05,948
He was the one who would give you
the shirt off his back...

562
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:12,078
and then he would tell you
that it made you look fat.

563
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:13,621
[mourners chuckle]

564
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:16,416
To my friend. Ken!

565
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:17,543
[all] Ken!

566
00:31:20,421 --> 00:31:21,796
Did I muck it up?

567
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:23,924
No, no. It was great. Great.

568
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:28,636
[Laffont] I know he let you down, Renée.

569
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:30,723
I'd like to think I wouldn't have.

570
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:34,685
But honestly, I know what it's like...

571
00:31:37,313 --> 00:31:38,731
to need to keep your head down.

572
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:43,861
Widow on your 6:00.

573
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:53,662
Glad we came.

574
00:31:54,872 --> 00:31:56,165
I'm glad she came.

575
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:00,544
I can see why she read you in.

576
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:03,797
[chuckles]

577
00:32:05,341 --> 00:32:08,218
It would've meant a lot to him
that you're here.

578
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:16,894
I know things didn't... [sighs]
...end well between you.

579
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,521
We had a lot of good times too.

580
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:22,858
He told me about your argument
the other night.

581
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:24,984
[inhales sharply]

582
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:27,321
He's been messed up for a while.

583
00:32:28,072 --> 00:32:31,659
I tried so hard to get him to rehab.

584
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:34,036
He was scared it would ruin his career.

585
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:39,500
I had no idea it was that bad.

586
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:41,126
[sighs]

587
00:32:44,088 --> 00:32:45,631
And he knew he got it wrong, Renée.

588
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:51,553
About Olivas.

589
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:54,430
He overheard something at work recently.

590
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:57,893
Olivas joking about sleeping
with an ex-partner,

591
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:01,104
saying that she was back for more.

592
00:33:01,105 --> 00:33:03,107
But it was the way that Olivas said it.

593
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:06,110
It was like he had crossed a line
with this woman.

594
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:07,695
And Ken realized...

595
00:33:09,363 --> 00:33:10,572
you were telling the truth.

596
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:14,410
It hit him hard, Renée.

597
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:20,582
[sighs] Goodbye. Take care of yourself.

598
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:37,641
[sighs] Oh.

599
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:39,727
- Hey.
- Morning.

600
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:41,978
Did you ever hear back from Andrei?

601
00:33:41,979 --> 00:33:45,274
[stutters] I did. That's why I wanted
to catch you before you went inside.

602
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:49,111
Tell me.

603
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:52,322
Um...

604
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:58,245
Yulia's parents were killed
in the conflict.

605
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,206
The whole town was pretty much leveled.

606
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:03,375
Um...

607
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:08,463
Which is why you haven't been able
to do your magic...

608
00:34:08,464 --> 00:34:12,342
[stutters] Your Internet magic,
not your other magic.

609
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:18,431
- Oh, okay.
- I'm sorry, Colleen.

610
00:34:18,432 --> 00:34:19,516
That's...

611
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:21,894
Wow.

612
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:32,821
[smacks lips, stammers]
You can go back inside. I just...

613
00:34:34,531 --> 00:34:36,158
I need a minute. I'll be okay.

614
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:39,119
[sniffles]

615
00:34:46,877 --> 00:34:48,545
[sniffles, sighs]

616
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:55,302
[Colleen sighs]

617
00:35:08,482 --> 00:35:10,943
Thanks for coming yesterday. Meant a lot.

618
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:12,736
It was no trouble.

619
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,574
[Ballard] So, why are we here?

620
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:23,037
Mr. Fuentes is very eager
to help the LAPD out in any way he can.

621
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:25,915
Oh. He was very eager to do
a lot of things last time we saw him.

622
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:29,169
But his cooperation
is predicated on a deal.

623
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:30,796
What kind of deal?

624
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:33,924
Time served and protection.

625
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:37,260
Why should we trust an ex-con
with known ties to the cartel?

626
00:35:37,261 --> 00:35:38,594
That's exactly why.

627
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:41,181
[sighs] If he's talking,
he needs assurances.

628
00:35:42,683 --> 00:35:44,976
Look, due to backlogs,
my client has been denied trial

629
00:35:44,977 --> 00:35:47,229
for longer than the sentence
he would've received.

630
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:50,648
And he's endured life-changing injuries
as a result.

631
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:53,317
We'd like time served
and witness protection.

632
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:54,944
Not if he's involved.

633
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:56,697
I promise you that's not the case.

634
00:35:57,406 --> 00:36:00,784
Well, I'll take it to the DA,
but she'll only deal if the intel's good.

635
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,545
The gun that killed Ibarra was, like...

636
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:14,380
recycled.

637
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:17,091
We know the cartel runs guns
through Mexico and back.

638
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:18,509
It's not our jurisdiction.

639
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,678
It's not the cartel.

640
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:21,513
It's the cops.

641
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:26,727
Go on.

642
00:36:27,436 --> 00:36:29,438
A ring of cops is running hot guns.

643
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,942
They take 'em straight off the streets
and sell them to the cartel for big bank.

644
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:35,861
It's not just guns.

645
00:36:36,445 --> 00:36:39,447
They got their hands in all
the cartel shit. Drugs, trafficking...

646
00:36:39,448 --> 00:36:40,990
Is this why Ibarra was killed?

647
00:36:40,991 --> 00:36:42,242
You're not listening.

648
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:46,871
This is way bigger than a coyote, or some
fool like me frontin' big on the block.

649
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:48,999
Then what's a fool like you know about it?

650
00:36:50,751 --> 00:36:51,793
I needed a piece.

651
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:54,086
You ask, you get.

652
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:55,297
Who gave it to you?

653
00:36:58,425 --> 00:36:59,676
It was definitely a cop.

654
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:04,765
LAPD. White dude, 40s.

655
00:37:05,766 --> 00:37:07,433
Street guys call him Montana.

656
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:10,646
He lives for this gang shit, but
he doesn't mind playing sheriff either.

657
00:37:11,188 --> 00:37:12,563
He's playing both sides.

658
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:14,191
Uses his badge for fun.

659
00:37:15,776 --> 00:37:18,612
A few years back,
a huge raid locked up five homeboys.

660
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:23,575
Two got sent to intensive care,
compliments of this dude.

661
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:26,912
That's all I know.

662
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:31,792
But if you find him,
I bet you find the others.

663
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,632
[Parker] And there's no chance Javi
was talking about a different raid?

664
00:37:39,633 --> 00:37:42,343
[Laffont] No. This has to be the one.
It's the right time frame.

665
00:37:42,344 --> 00:37:44,595
Uh, five lockups, two ICUs.

666
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:47,431
Although, it is unclear
who put those two in the hospital.

667
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:48,517
Of course it is.

668
00:37:49,518 --> 00:37:51,268
FID'd wanna keep that quiet.

669
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,562
I could pull personnel files
for everyone on the raid.

670
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:55,940
Try to narrow it down
based on Javi's description.

671
00:37:55,941 --> 00:37:57,650
But that would leave a paper trail.

672
00:37:57,651 --> 00:38:01,612
Lucky for you I got them already.
And with no digital footprint.

673
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:03,197
Look at you burying our lede.

674
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:05,575
You know I have a flair for the dramatic.

675
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:10,455
What did Javi say, uh... Mid-40s, white...

676
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:13,874
Here are six candidates.

677
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:15,544
How did you get these?

678
00:38:16,128 --> 00:38:20,424
Apparently there are still some women
who are not immune to my roguish charms.

679
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:23,218
Oh, Linda from personnel? Still?

680
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,137
Why the tone of surprise?

681
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:34,980
This guy, Anthony Driscoll.

682
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,358
He's got more than a few complaints
against him for excessive force.

683
00:38:38,859 --> 00:38:40,402
Javi said Montana was violent.

684
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,281
In lieu of termination, resigned 2022.

685
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:47,367
Under the influence of illegal narcotics.

686
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:50,495
- Wait, what did you say his name was?
- Anthony Driscoll.

687
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:55,291
Anthony AKA Tony.

688
00:38:55,292 --> 00:38:57,961
Who's another Tony with a violent streak
and a drug problem?

689
00:38:58,545 --> 00:39:00,130
Tony Montana.

690
00:39:02,466 --> 00:39:06,010
Y'all, <i>Scarface</i> is like
a patron saint to gangbangers.

691
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:08,472
All right.
Let's get a six-pack in front of Javi.

692
00:39:11,475 --> 00:39:13,142
[Javi] That's him right there.

693
00:39:13,143 --> 00:39:14,811
That's the <i>cabrón</i> they call Montana.

694
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:16,980
No doubt in my mind.

695
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:24,653
[Ballard] Let's start a workup
on Driscoll.

696
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:27,239
Everything that he did in the department
and everything he's done since.

697
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,741
Oh, uh, first thing tomorrow?

698
00:39:28,742 --> 00:39:31,077
I gotta pick up Ralph
from doggy day care, okay?

699
00:39:31,078 --> 00:39:33,705
- Well, obviously. First thing tomorrow.
- Bye.

700
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:39,502
You good?

701
00:39:39,503 --> 00:39:43,089
[scoffs] Moratorium on anyone asking
me that for the next couple of months.

702
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:44,174
Okay.

703
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:46,801
- You good?
- You kidding?

704
00:39:46,802 --> 00:39:50,596
Finally got confirmation on what
I suspected after all these years?

705
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:52,516
I am ready to get those fuckers.

706
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:55,852
Aren't you?

707
00:39:57,521 --> 00:39:59,356
I'm just preparing myself.

708
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,150
Last time I came for one
of the Brotherhood it didn't go so well.

709
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:07,279
[inhales deeply] The complaint you filed?
[sighs] Against Olivas, right?

710
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,907
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

711
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,533
You know what that was about?

712
00:40:10,534 --> 00:40:12,077
Figured if you wanted me to know.

713
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:13,745
I want you to know.

714
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:19,251
He tried to assault me at a party.

715
00:40:23,004 --> 00:40:28,176
Chastain saw me afterwards, and I thought
he would back me up but he didn't.

716
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,554
So, Olivas got away with it.

717
00:40:37,811 --> 00:40:39,187
I'm sorry that happened to you.

718
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:43,358
Me too.

719
00:40:45,694 --> 00:40:46,695
Thanks.

720
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:53,326
Have a good night, Ballard.

721
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:22,939
So...

722
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:25,567
[sighs]

723
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:28,361
...tell me about your new girlfriend.

724
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:30,947
[chuckles]

725
00:41:32,449 --> 00:41:33,950
[inaudible chatter]
