(SOPRANOS THEME SONG)

2
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:53,153
Hey, no speeding.
This is a party zone!

3
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:55,114
(ROWDY CHATTER)

4
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,866
Come on! We can do it!

5
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,497
Hey, Janet Jackson.

6
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:04,915
Hi, Mr. Soprano!

7
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,583
Where's Meadow?

8
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,961
I give up. In the house?

9
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:20,139
- Tony.
- Billy, thanks for calling.

10
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:23,267
As soon as I found out
it was your mom's place.

11
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:32,776
O.D. Friend says
Special K and ecstasy.

12
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:37,239
- You fucking kidding me?
- Your kid's all right.

13
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,116
She's a little drunk.

14
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,661
321, repeat, you're breaking up.

15
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:48,917
529, are you in pursuit
of vehicle on 75 North?

16
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:07,561
- In your grandmother's house.
- It wasn't my fault.

17
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,022
If I had a quarter
every time I heard that...

18
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:13,150
...I'd have a private jet
on 24-hour standby.

19
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,611
Get in the car.

20
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,323
(VOMITING)

21
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:28,123
- In your grandmother's house.
- Now he's repeating himself.

22
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,377
Just lucky I knew that cop.
So he cut me a favor.

23
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:35,005
Let me guess, he owes you money?

24
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,348
(CAR APPROACHING)

25
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,726
- What did she do?
- Go upstairs.

26
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:52,105
- No, I want to see the fight.
- Get your little ass up those stairs!

27
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:54,816
Meadow!

28
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:58,070
- We can talk about it in the morning.
- Get down here!

29
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,321
Let her go to bed.

30
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:03,242
I want her to answer for herself!
She's drunk! Was she driving?

31
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,744
I could've taken ecstasy but I didn't!

32
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,579
Don't puke on the floor!

33
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,248
You still up? Go to bed!

34
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:13,377
- She's on ecstasy and you yell at me?
- Get up there!

35
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,217
What did she say for herself?

36
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,136
The usual shit. "Wasn't my fault."

37
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:26,139
There was designer drugs there, Tony.

38
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,975
So, what did you say?

39
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,354
I don't know. I yelled.
What the fuck else am I gonna do?

40
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,073
You sure you're gonna
be all right, Uncle Rich?

41
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,700
I want to walk.

42
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,577
See if I run into any
of the old crowd.

43
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,706
Thanks, doll.

44
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,263
Motherfucker.

45
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,481
There has to be consequences.

46
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:20,444
What kind of parents would we be
if we let her get away with this?

47
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:21,695
Typical?

48
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:24,114
Plenty of parents
still crack the whip.

49
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,533
Yeah, that's what they tell you.

50
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,786
I cannot wait until
she goes off to college.

51
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,664
Oh, right, so you can get
Empty Nest Syndrome...

52
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:35,542
...and go on Wellbutrin
like your sister.

53
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:41,173
As a parent today, you are over
a barrel no matter what you do.

54
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,759
You take the car, you're a chauffeur.

55
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:46,595
Ground her, you stay in
and be a prison guard.

56
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:49,431
Throw her out,
social services returns her...

57
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,767
...and we face a judge.
She's not 18 yet.

58
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,769
That's your solution?

59
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:59,107
All I'm saying, with the laws today,
you can't restrain your kid physically.

60
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,818
She could sue you for child abuse.

61
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,363
There has to be consequences.

62
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:05,655
And there will be.

63
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,532
I hear you, okay?

64
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:11,870
Let's not overplay our hand. If she
knows we're powerless, we're fucked.

65
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:15,582
Hey.

66
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:24,341
That guy wants to talk to you.

67
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:28,553
Jesus. Mother of Christ! Richie.

68
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,640
So when did you get out?
How come nobody told me?

69
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:36,561
That's funny. Paulie Walnuts
told me he ran into you this morning.

70
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,898
Honest to fucking God,
nobody said a word.

71
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,441
Just shut the fuck up.

72
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:50,617
You know, I did a lot of meditation
in the can on this.

73
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:51,868
On what?

74
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:55,664
You can't believe how crazy things...

75
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,208
- You ever meditate?
- Me? Meditate?

76
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,670
- Are you crazy?
- Not as crazy as I used to be.

77
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:04,589
But still crazy enough
to take an eye out.

78
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,716
What's going on here, Rich?

79
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:11,388
Ten years. And not even a pleasant
"Go fuck yourself" from you I get.

80
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,599
You know, I always asked
how you were doing.

81
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,477
Hold on there. You.

82
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:21,440
How could you let my dear friend
sit here with an empty cup?

83
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,358
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

84
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:25,110
Take it easy, kid.

85
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,946
Bring this gentleman
a veal-parm sandwich.

86
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,240
And hurry the fuck up about it.

87
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:34,202
The other two stores
doing as good as this?

88
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:36,288
Come on, you know, it's a grind.

89
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,002
That doesn't answer my question.

90
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:47,549
Rich, I know you're a made guy,
so I lose either way.

91
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:50,677
But I always respected you
and your brother, Jackie.

92
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,637
I'm no victim here.

93
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:56,141
I'm not some greaseball storeowner.
I'm sorry, Richie.

94
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,351
I will not be shaken down.

95
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:02,147
This sucking up to Tony Soprano
has done wonders for you.

96
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:06,401
I go away for a while. I come back,
you're a tough guy.

97
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,320
- Don't do this.
- Do what?

98
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:09,988
Take what's owed to me?

99
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,991
- What's owed to you?
- I put you in action, Beansie.

100
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,704
You got a bad memory, Beansie.

101
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,210
Veal parmigiana sandwich.

102
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,545
Fuck you.

103
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,592
I'll be back every Saturday, partner.

104
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,594
I don't fucking believe this.

105
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:36,848
I'm being shaken down, for what?
Tell me, what did I do?

106
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,350
This is not right.

107
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,727
I'm not gonna fucking lay down.

108
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:42,437
I'll step up.

109
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:58,662
Won't lay down, huh? You don't want
to lay dawn? You piece of shit!

110
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,292
All right, let's get her down here.

111
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,961
I guess.

112
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,506
- Where is the Bride of Frankenstein?
- She's still sleeping.

113
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,260
- Yeah, right. Go wake her up.
- I wake her up?

114
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,805
I want to get this shit
out of the way before I go out.

115
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:21,184
- You guys are making too much of this.
- I don't think we're making enough.

116
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,686
She was drunk.

117
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,272
Her choice. There's a Zuni saying:

118
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:28,149
"For every 20 wrongs
a child does, ignore 19."

119
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:32,487
There's an old Italian saying:
"You fuck up once, you lose two teeth."

120
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:36,616
That's what all this is about.
Ego and control.

121
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:40,328
- I beg your pardon?
- No, don't try to make sense with her.

122
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,498
No, I want to understand this.
Go ahead, tell me.

123
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:46,626
You want to hold on to control
over a young woman...

124
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,087
...whose entire
biological determinism...

125
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,923
...is to achieve independent
thought and behavior.

126
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,134
She's exercised her independence...

127
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:58,138
...but you want to penalize her
because you don't like her choices.

128
00:09:58,347 --> 00:09:59,973
Go get a fucking permanent.

129
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:02,267
I'm trying to watch TV!

130
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,438
Well.

131
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:12,485
Good morning.
I'm sorry, is it afternoon?

132
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,988
- Mom, please.
- Please what?

133
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:19,200
- You'd better have some answers.
- (TONY) Yeah. That's right!

134
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:25,957
- Fine. You're punished.
- For what? I didn't do anything!

135
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,292
You did nothing?

136
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:30,295
- It wasn't my fault!
- It's never your fault, Meadow.

137
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:33,340
It was gonna be me,
Hunter and the Macaluso twins.

138
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:36,760
Then Steve shows up with Adam
and people from Boonton!

139
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:40,472
So Steve's just trying doorknobs
till he hits the jackpot?

140
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,600
- No, Hunter tells him.
- Now with the Hunter.

141
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:47,479
And she's at home, blaming it on you.
It's an old game.

142
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:51,608
You try studying day and night
to get into college.

143
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:55,028
- We work hard. We deserved a night!
- Take it easy.

144
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,905
Take it easy.

145
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,618
I'm sorry you're under a lot of
pressure. It's still no excuse.

146
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:08,667
- So who was this ecstasy guy?
- I just told you. Adam.

147
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,169
I don't know him.
He came with Steve.

148
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,381
The Steve I know?
The school kid you're always with?

149
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:18,051
He's a flake. Why do you think
I stopped hanging with him?

150
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,470
That's news to me you don't
hang out with Steve.

151
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:24,724
It's painful to talk about, okay?

152
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,726
You're gonna get punished.

153
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:32,148
Look, you guys,
I know what I did was not okay.

154
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:37,570
I've been thinking about it a lot and
really not feeling good about myself.

155
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,615
You should take away my Discover card.

156
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,368
- You better believe it!
- That's right!

157
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:44,577
For two weeks.

158
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,121
Three!

159
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,756
How do I buy gas?

160
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,216
Your allowance.

161
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:01,136
I spent my allowance.
And I already owe Mom.

162
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,638
The Pashmina.

163
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,975
We can wait on that.

164
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:10,437
You get 10 dollars a week. Cash.

165
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,313
No more.

166
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,942
Till you get your card back.
For gas!

167
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:28,037
Come here.

168
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,709
Look at you.
You look great. You're sinew.

169
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:36,588
You sack of shit. If you lost that
baby fat, you'd disappoint me.

170
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,256
Hey, fuck you.

171
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,842
You been laid yet?

172
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,678
God, what's wrong? I'm trying.

173
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:45,764
Hey, I said 4:00.

174
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,183
I leave before
the stock market closes...

175
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,810
...you yell for not watching
the phone guys.

176
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,312
Meet Richie Aprile.

177
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,399
Jesus Christ, how you doing?

178
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,611
Your brother, Jackie,
was like a fucking god.

179
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:03,281
A great leader.
And I heard a lot about you.

180
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,617
Yeah, well, I heard a lot about you.

181
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,202
That's why I'm here.

182
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,205
What do you mean?

183
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:14,542
Out of respect for our friend here,
I'm gonna talk nice.

184
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,504
I ever hear you raise your hands
to my niece again...

185
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,964
...next time you won't see my face.

186
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,633
You understand?

187
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,927
Who told you I put my hand on her?

188
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,054
Is this kid getting jerky with me?

189
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,225
Look, kid, I shouldn't
have to explain myself.

190
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,185
I'm from the old school.

191
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:35,355
You want to raise your hands,
give her your last name.

192
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,148
Then it's not my business.

193
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:41,820
Until then, keep your hands
in your pockets.

194
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,655
We understand each other?

195
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,246
Now get out of here.

196
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:53,665
I want to talk to Tony.

197
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,625
Go ahead.

198
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,220
He's a good kid.

199
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,223
Capable.

200
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:15,228
Look, Ton, this is the thing.

201
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,522
I want to get my shy business back.

202
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:20,358
I keep getting calls
from Jackie's customers...

203
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:24,195
- Where the fuck are you going?
- I'll talk to you later, Richie.

204
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,031
What just happened?

205
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:29,576
No more business talk
with him directly.

206
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,411
You fucking with me?

207
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,413
You can talk to him.

208
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,039
But not now.

209
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,542
And never here.

210
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,594
Can you believe we drank
a whole bottle of wine?

211
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,429
Thank God!

212
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,140
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

213
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,434
- We're out of here.
- Okay.

214
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,353
Richie broke a chair over his head.

215
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,063
You shitting me?

216
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:02,233
Hit him with a coffeepot too.
Broke his cheekbone.

217
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:06,321
Prick. I talked to him yesterday.
He's all sweetness and lights.

218
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,448
Already this shit's getting old.

219
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,410
Yo, bright eyes.

220
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:16,164
- Where you going?
- This isn't the Bing, huh?

221
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,498
Fuck did I say?

222
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,667
Hey, how have you been?

223
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,630
Can't complain.

224
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,593
- You look good.
- Where did your friends go?

225
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:32,180
- Tell them to come back, join us.
- No, they're leaving.

226
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,641
First time here. Excellent veal.

227
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,101
We making small talk now?

228
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,104
Nice to see you.

229
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,773
Yeah, you too.

230
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,446
- Toodle-oo.
- Bye-bye.

231
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,740
Not a bad ass.

232
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:54,494
She had nice pipe-fitter lips.
No disrespect.

233
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,039
Hey, what do I give a fuck?
I hardly know her.

234
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,793
You mean, you would take
the lips over the tits?

235
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:05,213
Trust me, my boy.
There's two things I'm good at:

236
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:08,341
It's pulling dents
and spotting good blowjobs.

237
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:12,220
And that sweetie had
world-class blowjob lips.

238
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:15,139
Am I right, skipper? Good or no?

239
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:18,685
What the fuck do I know?
It was a long time ago.

240
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:23,481
All right, she was good. All right?

241
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,191
Good?

242
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,567
Or great?

243
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:32,407
Why you busting my balls?
It was a long time ago.

244
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:35,451
Hey, I remember
every blowjob I ever got.

245
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,537
You remember your first blowjob?

246
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,247
Yeah, of course.

247
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,541
How long did it take
for the guy to come?

248
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,752
I said, "You remember
your first blowjob?"

249
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:48,715
"Yeah." "How long did it take
for the guy to come?"

250
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,510
"Toodle-fucking-oo"?

251
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,762
What the fuck was that?

252
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,557
I couldn't sleep
from the embarrassment.

253
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:01,102
What was so wrong?
It's an accepted form of goodbye.

254
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,938
That's not the way
I talk with patients.

255
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,482
It wasn't me. It was someone else.

256
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,900
It was Jennifer.

257
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:13,364
For whatever reason, at that moment,
you felt safer showing him Jennifer.

258
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:17,285
What did you see at that table
that made you want to hide "Doctor"?

259
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:18,870
Who were you hiding from?

260
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:22,165
I saw a patient that
I never wanted to see again.

261
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:25,209
That's who I was hiding from.
A patient.

262
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,336
When you say "see"...

263
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:31,215
...do you mean professionally
or just plain "see"?

264
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:34,385
- What's the difference?
- There's a big difference.

265
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,972
If it was just a matter
of just plain old "see"...

266
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,892
...the cordial doctor
would've said, "Good night."

267
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:45,313
But, because he's someone you didn't
want to see professionally...

268
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:49,275
...you abandoned the doctor façade
and adopted the Jennifer posture.

269
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,402
Hence, "Toodle-oo."

270
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,363
You're almost there,
Elliot, but not quite.

271
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:58,201
Young girls are not accountable
for their behavior.

272
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:02,288
I think "Toodle-oo" was the action
of a ditsy young girl.

273
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:07,877
And I regressed into the girl thing
to escape responsibility...

274
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:10,880
...for abandoning a patient.

275
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,840
He asked me for help.

276
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:20,431
Look, I need you as a colleague
to tell me that I did the right thing.

277
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:24,268
You gotta ask yourself
why you became a psychiatrist.

278
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:27,772
If it was to help people stop
smoking or biting nails...

279
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:30,691
...then so be it.
There's nothing wrong with that.

280
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:34,904
Another patient committed suicide
because I was treating this man.

281
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,198
Because I had to go on the lam.

282
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:40,284
Treating patients from a motel room
isn't optimum...

283
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:43,079
...but you were there for her,
in phone contact.

284
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:46,082
It would have been the same
if you'd been on vacation.

285
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,711
Did you say "lam"?

286
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,134
(YOGA INSTRUCTOR)
And lifting up into Cobra.

287
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:05,101
And now rising up
into Downward Facing Dog.

288
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,275
Coming back down into Cobra.

289
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,785
And relaxing into Child's Pose.

290
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:29,667
Richie.

291
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:34,505
Janice. You know,
I thought that was you.

292
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:35,840
"Parvati."

293
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:40,011
I changed my name to Parvati in '78.

294
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,513
I thought you lived in California now.

295
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:45,766
Seattle, actually, last couple years.

296
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:50,771
- So, how long you been?
- Out of jail?

297
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,609
One week. That's where
I picked up this yoga shit.

298
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:57,028
It's working. You seem very supple.

299
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,530
I'm doing a lot of stretching.

300
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,826
- So you back now?
- My mom's at St. Erasmus. A stroke.

301
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:06,913
Sorry to hear that.
Tony didn't say anything about it.

302
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:14,337
- Guess we're all getting a little old.
- Only if that's our choice.

303
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,228
Drag me all the way out here...

304
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:34,106
I walk through the food court,
this kid spills fried rice on me.

305
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:37,902
Take it easy.
Keep your voice down. Let's talk.

306
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:40,863
Yeah, let's. How would you feel?

307
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:45,409
Your crew evaporates, then you walk
away from me like I got a disease.

308
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:48,579
I don't talk business.
Don't take it personal.

309
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,456
I'm a government target.

310
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,542
Why do you think we're meeting
in a fucking mall?

311
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:57,713
It feels disrespectful.
You know, that's all I'm saying.

312
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,050
I'm the guy who saved you
from the hit parade.

313
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,470
When? When did you ever
step in for me?

314
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,721
You forget?

315
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:09,058
You and my brother stuck up
Feech LaManna's card game?

316
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,685
Feech was a made man.

317
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:16,315
If it wasn't for me, you would've got
a vicious beating, to say the least.

318
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:17,942
You know I love you.

319
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:21,153
You're like my big brother.
You'll be taken care of.

320
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:24,365
What was yours before you left
will be yours again.

321
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,617
You just gotta give us some time.

322
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:30,288
Jeez, Anthony, you'd do that for me?

323
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,623
Hey, fuck you.

324
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:37,461
What's mine is not yours to give me.

325
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:42,133
- Hey, prick, you reached out to me.
- I said what I wanted to say.

326
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:48,180
Well, we got a problem, kid?

327
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,975
I'm trying to get you to slow down.

328
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:55,313
Things are different now.
You gotta be extra, extra careful.

329
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,773
When do you know me not to be careful?

330
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,025
When?

331
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:04,322
You been out of the can 10 minutes,
you shake down Beansie for a piece.

332
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:08,034
Do me a favor, back off.
He's a good earner.

333
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,077
Yeah, for you.

334
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,496
That's none of your fucking cazzi.

335
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:16,000
Those joints are a cash business.
They come in handy.

336
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:19,003
- He's a sneaky cocksucker.
- Whatever, back off.

337
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:22,381
You taking the side
of a civilian over me?

338
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:25,009
Christ, I'm asking you
to do me a favor.

339
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,429
Do it if you want to.
If you don't, go fuck yourself.

340
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:31,140
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

341
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,851
How's your sister?

342
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:38,064
- There's no need for that talk.
- What?

343
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:39,899
My sister.

344
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,444
Janice. How's she doing?

345
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:50,159
Oh, I thought you were baiting me.
You know...

346
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,286
"How's your sister?"
"Fuck your mother."

347
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:53,204
No.

See what she did?

350
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,987
- Who?
- Meadow.

351
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:09,655
That house is fucked!

352
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:14,034
- Thought you didn't swear.
- What are you talking about?

353
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:17,955
I'm outraged.
No, I am beyond outraged.

354
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:22,084
Talk about disgrace? Disrespect for
other people's property?

355
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,462
It's like a freaking
shooting gallery.

356
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:28,174
It smells of urine, there's puke
all over the hardwood floors...

357
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:31,760
- Sounds like your place in Venice.
- She's been punished.

358
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,471

Oh, Madonna,
that's some heavy shit there!

- Janice...
- If that was my child...

361
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,979
You got a lot of fucking balls,
you know that?

362
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:45,441
- Don't talk to me like that.
- Let's clear the air here.

363
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,569
You're a Vishnu-come-lately,
playing concerned.

365

You're here to pick
the frigging bones.

366
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:56,994
There's a lot I could say right now
that I am not gonna say.

367
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:59,622
A lot of balls.

He hasn't changed one iota
since we lived in Newark. Not one!

370
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:12,426
You're passing judgment on him, Janice.
On us as parents.

371
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:16,680
How we discipline our children
is none of anybody's business.

372
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:20,226
You let that girl walk all over you,
you'll regret it.

373
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:23,896
Mother of God, Janice!
Are all of you Sopranos the same?

374
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:27,566
I ask you nicely to stay out of it,
you pretend not to hear.

375
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,276
Maybe you'll hear this.

376
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:33,197
Mind your fucking business. Keep your
mouth shut when it comes to my kids!

377
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,031
Alright?!

378
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:39,662
Maybe I've stayed here too long.

379
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:54,134
The fall in the shower didn't affect
your pre-existing heart condition.

380
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:57,805
- But you already knew that.
- It never hurts to be sure.

381

Fucking bum hip.

382
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:03,602
What next does the Man Upstairs
have in store for me?

383
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,521
You're lucky it was a sprain.

384
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:10,150
The thing is, doc, I've been feeling
these, like, little fibrillations.

385
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,862
Psychosomatic.
You got out of jail on a medical.

386
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:18,450
It's the mind-body connection.
Your body's just pitching in to help.

There's my boy!

I was afraid you didn't
get the message.

Put a shirt on,
I'm getting a chubby.

392

Doc, this is one of my dearest friends.

393
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:43,767
Richie, this is the best heart man
in the world, Doug Schreck.

394
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:47,730
Mr. Soprano oversold me.
I'm only the best in the Western world.

395
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,732
Fucking ball-breaker.

396
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:52,484
Doc, do me a favor?

397
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,111
Me and Richie...

398
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:55,988
Yeah, no problem.

399
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:04,038
He's good. Lets me use his doctor-
patient privilege to meet people here.

400
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,751
Fucking house arrest.

401

I can taste Brylcreem.

402
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:19,887
Jesus, you look good.
How you feeling?

403
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:23,807
Better than some,
not as bad as others.

404
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:28,562
I gotta meet Tony at a mall, you here.
What the fuck is happening?

405
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:32,066
Like the man said,
"May you live in interesting times."

406
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:34,109
You met with Tony?

407
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,237
It's more like a fucking audience
with the pope.

408
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:39,990
What are you gonna do?

409
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:46,038
Whatever you tell me.

410
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:55,422
You and your brother
were always good boys.

411
00:27:56,132 --> 00:28:00,427
You tell me this is the way it is,
then so be it.

412
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,721
You tell me otherwise...

413
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,641
...I'm yours, Junior.

414
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,352
Whatever, whoever.

415
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,104
You just say it.

416
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,443
Once again, a big welcome home
to our guest of honor.

417
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:19,363
Richie was surprised by
the changes in 10 years.

418
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:21,365
New Jersey has a hockey team.

419
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:24,785
It's interesting,
Meadowlands is the only NHL arena...

420
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:28,080
...where the penalty box
is maximum-security.

421
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:31,333
Maximum-security penalty box.

422
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:32,584
Help me.

423
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:34,044
What the fuck?

424
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:36,171
I was talking to Paulie Walnuts...

425
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:39,299
...who thought that Richie
had been in Bosnia...

426
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:42,052
...where there's also
a large Muslim population.

427
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:44,138
- That's it. Out of here.
- Enough.

428
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:49,893
And now for all you youngsters with
visions of tit-fucking in your head...

429
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:52,312
...here are the Bing girls!
Come on!

Welcome home.

433
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:15,711
Wait till you open it. It's all ones.

434
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:19,339
I'm a grandfather now, Rich.
Imagine that?

435
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:20,966
Please, no pictures.

436
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:24,470
Exploiting medical curiosities
is against the law.

437
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:26,972
That why they canceled
your mom's audition?

438
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,223
What did you say?

439
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,350
- It's a homecoming.
- Cocksucker.

440
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,394

- Is Beansie here?
- Haven't seen him.

00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:55,375
What?

447
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,211
Go with Silvio.

448
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,670
- Who?
- Go!

449
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,297
I'll hold this.

450
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:03,467
- Don't worry about it.
- Come on.

fucking attitude problem.

- Careful.
- Come on.

He has a right to be a bit fucked up.

mine or his?

00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,825

- You were fine.

was gonna do for you?

- You don't?

- No.

my money smart and you didn't.

00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:01,025
A thousand percent? No.

686
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:03,027
A fucking million percent.

687
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:06,364
And let me tell you something.

688
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:09,325
He's lucky I ain't no rat fuck.

689
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:13,162
Because the law knows
that was no random hit-and-run.

690
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,873
Don't start talking foolish.

691
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:17,750
We're old school, right?

692
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,378
We wash our own dirty laundry.

693
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,217
Hey, am I right, Beans?

694
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:30,596
Yeah, yeah. Old school.

695
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:36,227
Okay, good.

696
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:44,235
So you here to see your ma?
I hear she's upstairs.

697
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:46,654
No, I came here to see you, you prick.

698
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:52,076
That's okay.

699
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:54,871
Go do what you gotta do.

700
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:07,174
- I told you to back off Beansie.
- I did. Then I put it in drive.

701
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:09,760
This is funny?
He might never walk again.

702
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:12,096
Did you know that? And for what?

703
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:13,806
He didn't duke you enough?

704
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:16,058
He didn't visit you in the can?

705
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:18,644
When did you visit anybody in the can?

706
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:22,523
When's the last time you gave a fuck
about anybody but yourself?

707
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:26,152
You remember one thing,
and listen good.

708
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:30,615
You want to talk this old school shit?
Here's a rule you might remember:

709
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:34,327
I'm the motherfucking fucking one
who calls the shots.

710
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:38,748
You pay me the respect I gave your
brother or we're gonna have a problem.

711
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:41,250
A bad one.

712
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,837
Now get the fuck out of here.

713
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:47,757
All right, Tony.

714
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:50,468
Yeah. All right.

715
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:02,605
- Hey.
- How you doing?

716
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:04,899
I'll open it, you change the locks.

717
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,525
Okay.

718
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:26,963
(COUGHING)

719
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:43,562
