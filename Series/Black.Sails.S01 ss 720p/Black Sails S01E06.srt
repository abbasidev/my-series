1
00:00:12,101 --> 00:00:15,114
That gentleman and his
daughter, the money they took,

2
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:17,120
ain't never coming back.

3
00:00:17,185 --> 00:00:20,362
We're going to recreate my father's
system here without my father.

4
00:00:20,435 --> 00:00:23,237
A consortium with all of
you sharing in the profits.

5
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,809
I'll do that the moment you
lift the ban on Captain Vane.

6
00:00:25,882 --> 00:00:27,147
Charles Vane is an animal.

7
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,191
You have until dark to come to your senses.

8
00:00:29,256 --> 00:00:31,163
Do you have some problem with
us holding onto that whore?

9
00:00:31,229 --> 00:00:33,228
It's up to us when we're done with her.

10
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:37,939
Hunting the Maria Aleyne
was never about money.

11
00:00:38,012 --> 00:00:41,891
It was an execution. Good men will die

12
00:00:41,957 --> 00:00:45,432
for some hidden agenda,
the Barlow woman's agenda.

13
00:00:45,497 --> 00:00:48,233
Boston is more forgiving of one's past.

14
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,971
With my family's assistance,

15
00:00:50,036 --> 00:00:52,375
<i>one might find a new life there.</i>

16
00:00:52,448 --> 00:00:54,578
<i>Andromache's manned like a warship. 60 men,</i>

17
00:00:54,651 --> 00:00:56,354
<i>at least. And they're fighters.</i>

18
00:00:58,284 --> 00:00:59,723
<i>Gates: He's in a reinforced hold.</i>

19
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:01,861
There's no way to get
the guns off the boat.

20
00:01:01,926 --> 00:01:05,261
<i>Anybody we send down there is
just gonna get cut to shreds.</i>

21
00:01:05,334 --> 00:01:07,968
<i>Bryson: Mr. Guthrie's orders were explicit.</i>

22
00:01:08,033 --> 00:01:10,539
No matter what, I was to make
sure that you were on this ship.

23
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,743
"I sent a message to the
captain of the Scarborough.

24
00:01:12,817 --> 00:01:15,990
I told him where he would find you."

25
00:01:16,055 --> 00:01:18,726
Good God, the Scarborough!

26
00:01:21,233 --> 00:01:24,172
<i>(theme music playing)</i>

27
00:02:57,507 --> 00:02:59,675
<i>(fire crackling)</i>

28
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,158
(goats bleating)

29
00:03:20,336 --> 00:03:23,470
(men shouting)

30
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:34,011
How far have we drifted?

31
00:03:34,076 --> 00:03:36,812
Not far. A few miles.

32
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:39,085
<i>Fucking Scarborough's out there, Billy.</i>

33
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,882
I can feel it. Just
waiting for a whiff of us

34
00:03:41,947 --> 00:03:43,681
so she can set those guns ablaze.

35
00:03:43,754 --> 00:03:45,889
Lars is almost ready.

36
00:03:45,955 --> 00:03:47,986
He'll have that bunker open in no time.

37
00:03:51,858 --> 00:03:53,329
Four hours till sunup.

38
00:03:54,897 --> 00:03:56,664
<i>If we can't get those guns before then,</i>

39
00:03:56,729 --> 00:03:59,969
Flint will let us leave, right?

40
00:04:15,711 --> 00:04:17,613
Here you go.

41
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,681
The wick's fast, so don't light her

42
00:04:21,747 --> 00:04:23,417
until you're right up to the bunker.

43
00:04:23,482 --> 00:04:27,050
Get it through the murder
hole and then take cover.

44
00:04:27,123 --> 00:04:29,153
The vanguard will be right behind you.

45
00:04:29,226 --> 00:04:32,024
While Bryson and his men
are choking on the smoke,

46
00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:35,158
we'll bust down the door, take him out,

47
00:04:35,223 --> 00:04:37,557
grab our guns and be on the way home.

48
00:04:42,932 --> 00:04:44,428
Did he say anything to you?

49
00:04:48,467 --> 00:04:49,601
About what?

50
00:04:52,537 --> 00:04:55,610
Bryson slipping off with
our guns is one thing,

51
00:04:55,675 --> 00:04:58,274
but bringing the Scarborough with him?

52
00:04:58,347 --> 00:05:00,747
How did he even know the navy was around?

53
00:05:00,812 --> 00:05:03,181
Richard Guthrie must have been involved.

54
00:05:03,254 --> 00:05:05,255
No shit. Do you think?

55
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,656
Where I get confused
is that Richard Guthrie

56
00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:09,959
was supposed to be under guard
at the Barlow woman's home.

57
00:05:10,032 --> 00:05:11,925
Isn't that what he told us?

58
00:05:11,998 --> 00:05:14,595
I mean, what do we really know about her?

59
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,700
She shares his love of books?

60
00:05:19,103 --> 00:05:21,575
Isn't it about time we start
asking some real questions?

61
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,841
Billy, not now.

62
00:05:23,913 --> 00:05:26,207
Please.

63
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:05,749
(speaks African dialect)

64
00:06:05,814 --> 00:06:07,651
He wants you to take it.

65
00:06:07,716 --> 00:06:10,913
(speaks African dialect)

66
00:06:10,986 --> 00:06:13,290
To place it in the hole above your head.

67
00:06:13,355 --> 00:06:17,095
<i>To signal to pirates.</i>

68
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,798
(speaks African dialect)

69
00:06:20,862 --> 00:06:22,565
He says if we help them,

70
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:25,203
they'll bring us back to their home.

71
00:06:26,436 --> 00:06:28,069
No.

72
00:06:28,142 --> 00:06:29,837
<i>(speaks African dialect)</i>

73
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,371
- He says...
- I know what he says.

74
00:06:32,444 --> 00:06:35,578
He says in Nassau a slave can be free,

75
00:06:35,643 --> 00:06:37,377
get a job and a wage.

76
00:06:37,442 --> 00:06:39,944
Maybe for him. He's strong.

77
00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:41,947
A few others.

78
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,419
The rest of you, don't kid yourself.

79
00:06:44,484 --> 00:06:47,619
You are cargo, in Nassau or otherwise.

80
00:06:47,692 --> 00:06:49,826
You would decide this for us all?

81
00:06:49,891 --> 00:06:51,258
This has nothing to do with you.

82
00:06:51,323 --> 00:06:53,562
We have a chance to be free.

83
00:06:53,627 --> 00:06:55,733
I don't care.

84
00:06:57,869 --> 00:06:59,132
There are weapons on this ship

85
00:06:59,205 --> 00:07:02,170
the pirates plan to return to Nassau,

86
00:07:02,235 --> 00:07:05,337
weapons that are very
dangerous to someone I love.

87
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:09,876
No matter what happens to me or to you,

88
00:07:09,948 --> 00:07:12,515
those weapons must not be returned.

89
00:07:16,753 --> 00:07:19,049
(hisses)

90
00:07:33,636 --> 00:07:35,572
<i>(men shouting)</i>

91
00:07:37,445 --> 00:07:39,610
<i>(door opens)</i>

92
00:07:39,675 --> 00:07:42,445
<i>(footsteps)</i>

93
00:07:59,164 --> 00:08:02,067
<i>Lilywhite: Time has
come for us to tell those</i>

94
00:08:02,132 --> 00:08:04,032
<i>who are aiming to make us slaves</i>

95
00:08:04,097 --> 00:08:07,432
they are no longer welcome in this place.

96
00:08:07,504 --> 00:08:09,273
- Not any longer!
- (Cheering)

97
00:08:09,338 --> 00:08:11,810
Fuck 'em! Fucking bastards.

98
00:08:11,876 --> 00:08:13,779
No fucking longer.

99
00:08:13,845 --> 00:08:15,779
Two hours.

100
00:08:15,842 --> 00:08:19,314
Two fucking hours she's
been holed up in there.

101
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:22,154
Well, I for one think this is a good sign.

102
00:08:25,051 --> 00:08:26,857
What?

103
00:08:26,922 --> 00:08:29,687
Clearly she's taking
the decision seriously.

104
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,329
I'm sorry, you think it's a good
sign she's taking this seriously?

105
00:08:33,394 --> 00:08:37,466
I can't even... Jesus.

106
00:08:37,532 --> 00:08:40,540
What I believe Captain
Lawrence meant to say

107
00:08:40,605 --> 00:08:42,873
is that as long as it
takes for Miss Guthrie

108
00:08:42,938 --> 00:08:46,336
to emerge from behind that door
and lift the ban on Captain Vane...

109
00:08:46,409 --> 00:08:48,208
<i>a decision which, a few hours ago,</i>

110
00:08:48,273 --> 00:08:51,376
she said would be taken
over her dead body...

111
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:54,712
then Captain Hornigold over there

112
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:58,352
walks away from our
nascent shipping consortium,

113
00:08:58,417 --> 00:09:00,285
killing it in its cradle.

114
00:09:00,351 --> 00:09:01,789
He withdraws his men from the street,

115
00:09:01,853 --> 00:09:04,219
at which point Captain
Lilywhite and his mob

116
00:09:04,284 --> 00:09:07,219
are free to burn everything in
sight with the Guthrie name on it.

117
00:09:07,292 --> 00:09:10,163
All of Nassau will, most
likely, descend into fiery mayhem

118
00:09:10,228 --> 00:09:12,531
from which we will all
be lucky to escape alive.

119
00:09:12,596 --> 00:09:14,995
Every moment that that door remains closed

120
00:09:15,068 --> 00:09:18,571
is a moment that Miss Guthrie
is considering that outcome

121
00:09:18,636 --> 00:09:22,399
as a viable, even preferable alternative

122
00:09:22,472 --> 00:09:24,271
to merely swallowing her pride.

123
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:29,442
I don't know.

124
00:09:29,515 --> 00:09:33,215
Perhaps you need to have a
little bit more faith in people.

125
00:09:58,471 --> 00:10:01,571
I'll take the good news
to Captain Lilywhite.

126
00:10:01,636 --> 00:10:04,004
Let him know he can stand down.

127
00:10:09,049 --> 00:10:11,150
<i>(men laugh)</i>

128
00:10:19,054 --> 00:10:20,862
Good news, everyone!

129
00:10:20,927 --> 00:10:23,325
The cunt's knuckled under.

130
00:10:23,398 --> 00:10:25,731
- (cheering)
- We're back in fucking business.

131
00:10:25,796 --> 00:10:28,593
<i>You hear that, eh? (laughing)</i>

132
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:37,507
So what's this now?

133
00:10:37,572 --> 00:10:40,504
She don't want no one touching the whore.

134
00:10:42,841 --> 00:10:45,010
What the fuck's your problem?

135
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,779
Another step and I'll show you.

136
00:10:46,853 --> 00:10:48,916
Mr. Hamund, permit me a
moment with our friend here.

137
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,353
Talk some sense into her, Jack.

138
00:10:55,256 --> 00:10:58,024
Before she goes and does something stupid.

139
00:11:00,257 --> 00:11:03,432
Tell me this is not happening.

140
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:06,595
Tell me you weren't about to fight
Mr. Hamund over that fucking whore.

141
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,098
Don't call her that.

142
00:11:10,499 --> 00:11:12,331
It would appear that
I've failed to appreciate

143
00:11:12,404 --> 00:11:14,340
just how deeply this
situation has disturbed you.

144
00:11:14,405 --> 00:11:16,541
But if you're intent on
following this course of action,

145
00:11:16,606 --> 00:11:18,572
then I suppose we should
do our farewells now

146
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:20,578
because I don't think I
can stomach watching the men

147
00:11:20,643 --> 00:11:23,178
throwing you into that tent as
well and having their way with you,

148
00:11:23,244 --> 00:11:26,053
which is where I fear this story ends

149
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:27,951
unless you pull your shit together.

150
00:11:39,493 --> 00:11:41,428
(chuckles)

151
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,419
Captain says no light.

152
00:12:00,484 --> 00:12:02,484

<i>Miranda's voice: "Believe me,
your obliged and faithful servant,</i>

179
00:13:35,121 --> 00:13:36,657
<i>Miranda Barlow."</i>

180
00:14:32,469 --> 00:14:33,908
(exhales)

181
00:14:35,245 --> 00:14:36,307
<i>(Lars grunts)</i>

182
00:14:40,475 --> 00:14:42,240
(sighs)

183
00:15:00,529 --> 00:15:02,864
Get me another plan.

184
00:15:04,867 --> 00:15:06,203
Fuck.

185
00:15:07,742 --> 00:15:10,444
I need to talk to you now.

186
00:15:30,459 --> 00:15:32,531
I found it in Bryson's cabin.

187
00:15:32,597 --> 00:15:33,932
It's from the Barlow woman.

188
00:15:34,005 --> 00:15:36,402
She wants a pardon for Flint in Boston.

189
00:15:36,467 --> 00:15:39,169
She says we're gonna kill him
when we learn of his betrayal.

190
00:15:39,234 --> 00:15:41,003
And?

191
00:15:41,076 --> 00:15:43,645
It says betrayal.

192
00:15:45,217 --> 00:15:46,520
I can see that.

193
00:15:46,585 --> 00:15:48,919
What do you want me to
do about it right now?

194
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:55,020
I know about the Maria Aleyne.

195
00:15:55,093 --> 00:15:56,389
What?

196
00:15:56,461 --> 00:15:58,599
I know Flint killed those people for her.

197
00:15:58,664 --> 00:16:00,662
I know Morley saw it and brought it to you.

198
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:02,702
And I know you did nothing.

199
00:16:02,767 --> 00:16:04,595
He played games with
his crewmen's lives then.

200
00:16:04,668 --> 00:16:07,161
He's doing it again now and he
knows he can get away with it

201
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:08,569
because we're protecting him.

202
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,237
- Because you are protecting him.
- Enough.

203
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:13,878
If you want to go to the
crew with this, be my guest.

204
00:16:13,943 --> 00:16:16,907
But I will do everything in my
power to frustrate you. Know that.

205
00:16:16,979 --> 00:16:19,273
How can you say that?

206
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:21,312
Because we're in fucking battle right now

207
00:16:21,377 --> 00:16:24,019
and I will not undermine
his control of what is,

208
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:26,021
frankly, a shitty situation

209
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:28,054
based on a letter written by a woman

210
00:16:28,127 --> 00:16:30,692
neither of us know a thing about.

211
00:16:33,164 --> 00:16:35,396
Just promise me that when
we get back to Nassau,

212
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:37,798
we will deal with this.

213
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:39,703
Everything all right?

214
00:16:39,768 --> 00:16:42,604
Fine.

215
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:45,436
Billy's come up with our next move.

216
00:16:47,846 --> 00:16:49,479
It's three hours till sunup.

217
00:16:49,552 --> 00:16:52,048
Perhaps you'd like to share
it with the rest of us.

218
00:17:03,098 --> 00:17:05,666
(dog barking)

219
00:17:11,536 --> 00:17:13,472
<i>Miranda: Pastor Lambrick.</i>

220
00:17:13,537 --> 00:17:16,346
It's later than I'm
comfortable taking company.

221
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:18,012
You shouldn't be here.

222
00:17:18,085 --> 00:17:21,282
I live here, Pastor. Or hadn't you noticed?

223
00:17:21,347 --> 00:17:24,522
Mr. Underhill agreed
to take Mr. Guthrie in.

224
00:17:24,587 --> 00:17:26,987
<i>Mr. Guthrie spun such a tale for him.</i>

225
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:30,260
<i>He said he's been bribing the Lords
Proprietor in London for years.</i>

226
00:17:30,325 --> 00:17:31,828
<i>Said he planned to use that fact</i>

227
00:17:31,893 --> 00:17:33,795
to extort preferential treatment from them

228
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,191
when England reasserts her rule here.

229
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:38,398
He promised wealth and prosperity.

230
00:17:38,463 --> 00:17:41,232
Even promised to see
Underhill declared governor.

231
00:17:41,305 --> 00:17:43,137
And that was it.

232
00:17:43,202 --> 00:17:45,074
How nice for Mr. Guthrie.

233
00:17:45,139 --> 00:17:46,843
It is nice.

234
00:17:46,907 --> 00:17:50,239
He now sleeps safely on
Mr. Underhill's plantation

235
00:17:50,312 --> 00:17:53,345
behind two dozen of the most
brutal overseers in the New World.

236
00:17:53,418 --> 00:17:56,115
Behind walls and guns and swords.

237
00:17:56,188 --> 00:17:57,956
I need no protection.

238
00:17:58,021 --> 00:17:59,986
Mrs. Barlow,

239
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:02,423
Mr. Guthrie has betrayed Captain Flint.

240
00:18:02,488 --> 00:18:03,919
And you've helped him to do it.

241
00:18:03,991 --> 00:18:06,327
If half of what I've heard
of Captain Flint is true,

242
00:18:06,392 --> 00:18:09,392
he will not react to your betrayal kindly.

243
00:18:09,465 --> 00:18:12,368
You do not understand any of this, Pastor.

244
00:18:12,433 --> 00:18:15,197
Then help me understand.

245
00:18:17,438 --> 00:18:20,606
Help me, because I
cannot in good conscience

246
00:18:20,671 --> 00:18:23,278
walk away from here believing
you to be in such peril.

247
00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:33,008
All right.

248
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:55,497
- (gasps)
- Good evening, cunt.

249
00:18:59,068 --> 00:19:01,570
If I wanted to kill you,
I'd have done it already.

250
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:08,332
What a piece of shit you are.

251
00:19:08,405 --> 00:19:10,236
Nose in the air.

252
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:13,309
Spoiled cunt playing at our business.

253
00:19:13,374 --> 00:19:16,413
Pains me being this close to you.

254
00:19:16,478 --> 00:19:18,274
Should tell you how fucking desperate I am.

255
00:19:18,347 --> 00:19:19,809
Desperate for what?

256
00:19:20,977 --> 00:19:23,912
- Your help.
- Beg your pardon?

257
00:19:23,985 --> 00:19:27,385
Your friend on the beach.

258
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:30,151
She fucked us and that needed answering.

259
00:19:30,224 --> 00:19:33,388
But then that night,

260
00:19:33,453 --> 00:19:35,588
she told you to go fuck yourself.

261
00:19:35,653 --> 00:19:37,892
Should have toasted her.

262
00:19:37,957 --> 00:19:40,124
If she had a cock, we probably would have.

263
00:19:41,891 --> 00:19:45,093
What Hamund's been doing to her...

264
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:48,262
ain't right.

265
00:19:48,327 --> 00:19:50,902
What do you want me to do about it?

266
00:19:50,967 --> 00:19:53,967
I've tried to help. She didn't
want it. Now my hands are tied.

267
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,605
- I can't...
- You could kill him.

268
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:59,874
I'd do it myself, but
the men saw us feuding.

269
00:19:59,939 --> 00:20:02,408
I go near him, I'll have
them all at my throat

270
00:20:02,473 --> 00:20:04,336
and no one at my back.

271
00:20:04,409 --> 00:20:06,807
Now's the time. Captain's gone.

272
00:20:06,871 --> 00:20:08,678
Don't know how long for.

273
00:20:08,743 --> 00:20:10,005
Wait, gone? Gone where?

274
00:20:10,078 --> 00:20:11,779
I don't know. I don't much give a shit.

275
00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:14,075
Left alone on a skiff this afternoon.

276
00:20:14,148 --> 00:20:17,982
But if he returns, he'll be another
one standing at Hamund's side.

277
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:22,759
If you're already suspected by the men,

278
00:20:22,824 --> 00:20:25,820
what's to say they don't suspect you
no matter how Hamund were to disappear?

279
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,594
What's to say that suspicion
doesn't lead to questions?

280
00:20:28,659 --> 00:20:31,090
And what's to say those
questions don't lead to me?

281
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:33,898
You fucking coward.

282
00:20:33,963 --> 00:20:35,465
Why? Because I've used my head

283
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:36,926
before making this mess even worse?

284
00:20:36,999 --> 00:20:39,595
'Cause for all your
shit, all your posturing,

285
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,563
you won't lift a finger to help her.

286
00:20:41,636 --> 00:20:42,963
I didn't say that.

287
00:20:43,036 --> 00:20:45,834
You said my plan was too dangerous.

288
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,306
Your plan isn't dangerous enough.

289
00:20:50,368 --> 00:20:52,701
Eight men left on your crew.

290
00:20:52,774 --> 00:20:55,173
Eight men who support
Hamund. You said it yourself.

291
00:20:55,238 --> 00:20:58,142
We kill him, they all
become threats to both of us.

292
00:20:58,207 --> 00:21:01,044
- It's foolish.
- Then what the fuck would you suggest?

293
00:21:01,109 --> 00:21:03,376
You want to kill Hamund,

294
00:21:03,441 --> 00:21:05,279
then you have to kill them all.

295
00:21:07,879 --> 00:21:10,814
They disappear all at once tonight

296
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,487
with neither of us implicated.

297
00:21:14,086 --> 00:21:15,547
There's eight of them.

298
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,752
Their guard is up. It's impossible.

299
00:21:19,351 --> 00:21:21,614
It's not impossible.

300
00:21:21,687 --> 00:21:23,751
We just need a little help.

301
00:21:33,122 --> 00:21:34,561
(chuckles)

302
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,730
I don't know how else to say this

303
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,931
except no.

304
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:43,001
I suppose there's fuck, no.

305
00:21:43,066 --> 00:21:44,503
Or fuck you.

306
00:21:44,568 --> 00:21:46,165
I think you misunderstand.

307
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:47,669
I wasn't asking you to help me.

308
00:21:47,734 --> 00:21:49,805
I was granting you the
opportunity to help me.

309
00:21:49,871 --> 00:21:52,070
But now, because of your tone,

310
00:21:52,143 --> 00:21:54,406
I'm disinclined to be so generous.

311
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,971
Beg pardon?

312
00:21:56,044 --> 00:21:57,641
Now you'll beg me for it.

313
00:21:59,409 --> 00:22:01,679
What the fuck are you talking about?

314
00:22:01,744 --> 00:22:03,975
All those days ago when you first proposed

315
00:22:04,048 --> 00:22:06,879
this arrangement of yours to Flint...

316
00:22:06,952 --> 00:22:09,884
remaining with his crew, holding
onto the last piece of the schedule

317
00:22:09,949 --> 00:22:11,715
to ensure you weren't disposed of...

318
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:14,156
<i>when he asked you what's
to stop him from killing you</i>

319
00:22:14,221 --> 00:22:16,556
when all's said and done,
do you remember your answer?

320
00:22:16,621 --> 00:22:19,389
No, but I'm guessing you do.

321
00:22:19,462 --> 00:22:22,325
I believe you said,

322
00:22:22,398 --> 00:22:24,731
"We might be friends by then."

323
00:22:24,796 --> 00:22:26,328
(snickers)

324
00:22:26,393 --> 00:22:29,527
I'm sorry, what are you driving at?

325
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,664
You've spent enough time with the man now.

326
00:22:31,737 --> 00:22:33,503
Does he strike you as the type of person

327
00:22:33,569 --> 00:22:35,568
who would ever under any circumstance

328
00:22:35,641 --> 00:22:37,470
leave a loose end like you walking around?

329
00:22:39,838 --> 00:22:42,373
<i>When I took your advice and
lifted the ban on Charles Vane,</i>

330
00:22:42,446 --> 00:22:46,044
I became the center of all
commerce on this island again.

331
00:22:46,109 --> 00:22:48,683
Someone you don't want as an enemy.

332
00:22:48,748 --> 00:22:51,978
Someone Flint doesn't want as an enemy.

333
00:22:52,051 --> 00:22:56,050
The way I see it, I may be
the only person in this world

334
00:22:56,123 --> 00:22:58,489
who can dissuade him from killing you.

335
00:23:04,189 --> 00:23:06,091
Miranda: I had a very different life

336
00:23:06,157 --> 00:23:08,795
before I came here,

337
00:23:08,859 --> 00:23:11,289
a life I shared with my husband.

338
00:23:13,129 --> 00:23:16,201
He was a special man,

339
00:23:16,266 --> 00:23:18,297
a man of ideas...

340
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:20,304
about the world,

341
00:23:20,369 --> 00:23:22,198
about the order of things.

342
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:26,436
Writers, artists, men of science...

343
00:23:26,501 --> 00:23:29,476
they'd fill our drawing
room night after night

344
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:32,078
to talk and argue.

345
00:23:33,542 --> 00:23:36,179
Sometimes just to listen to him.

346
00:23:38,147 --> 00:23:40,345
In some ways he was like you...

347
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:42,715
a shepherd to his flock.

348
00:23:44,086 --> 00:23:46,190
He would have loved to have met you.

349
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:49,123
<i>Me?</i>

350
00:23:49,196 --> 00:23:51,392
You think I can play devil's advocate.

351
00:23:51,457 --> 00:23:53,254
Thomas would have played that game with you

352
00:23:53,327 --> 00:23:55,389
from dusk until dawn.

353
00:23:55,462 --> 00:23:57,495
And everything you hold sacred,

354
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,803
he'd leave in tatters.

355
00:23:59,868 --> 00:24:02,570
Not from malice or hate,

356
00:24:02,635 --> 00:24:05,303
but from love.

357
00:24:05,368 --> 00:24:08,340
From a desire to see the yoke of shame

358
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:10,573
lifted from your shoulders.

359
00:24:11,878 --> 00:24:14,244
You think I am ashamed?

360
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,479
My husband and I were happy.

361
00:24:20,174 --> 00:24:22,212
But in London, a happy life

362
00:24:22,277 --> 00:24:24,181
can often be a very dangerous thing.

363
00:24:25,719 --> 00:24:28,783
Something that other
people simply cannot abide.

364
00:24:31,589 --> 00:24:34,322
Thomas learned that lesson all too well.

365
00:24:37,526 --> 00:24:40,768
Captain Flint was Thomas's closest friend.

366
00:24:41,863 --> 00:24:43,766
And after his death, he saw fit

367
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:47,436
to spirit me here for my own safety.

368
00:24:47,501 --> 00:24:49,470
Flint brought you here?

369
00:24:50,776 --> 00:24:52,408
You're right, I don't understand.

370
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,680
I just told you. Captain
Flint is my deliverer.

371
00:24:55,745 --> 00:24:58,882
There's nothing more
you need to understand.

372
00:25:01,651 --> 00:25:04,020
Why are you here?

373
00:25:06,021 --> 00:25:07,860
I'm concerned for your safety.

374
00:25:07,926 --> 00:25:09,589
It's late.

375
00:25:09,662 --> 00:25:12,259
You knew I'd be alone. It's inappropriate.

376
00:25:15,997 --> 00:25:19,501
You're not here because you
want to protect me, Pastor.

377
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,508
You're here because you want to fuck me.

378
00:26:01,812 --> 00:26:04,840
(moans)

379
00:26:08,646 --> 00:26:11,183
(breathing heavily)

380
00:26:26,294 --> 00:26:29,102
I'm sorry. We dangle?

381
00:26:30,199 --> 00:26:32,971
Four men suspended over the side.

382
00:26:33,036 --> 00:26:35,634
Axes, augers, charges.

383
00:26:35,707 --> 00:26:38,643
<i>It's a rapid penetration to
get a charge through the hole.</i>

384
00:26:38,708 --> 00:26:42,181
Cause disruption, distraction

385
00:26:42,246 --> 00:26:45,782
while we move on the bunker
through the hold below.

386
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,116
Saw Avery try it once.

387
00:26:47,181 --> 00:26:50,113
- And it worked?
- I said I saw it tried.

388
00:26:51,522 --> 00:26:53,985
Volunteers?

389
00:27:01,894 --> 00:27:03,861
(sighs)

390
00:27:03,926 --> 00:27:06,293
Paxton.

391
00:27:07,998 --> 00:27:09,899
Bobby.

392
00:27:12,098 --> 00:27:14,063
Dooly.

393
00:27:16,903 --> 00:27:18,231
Logan.

394
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:25,640
Something wrong?

395
00:27:25,713 --> 00:27:28,142
Even if we do hack through,

396
00:27:28,215 --> 00:27:30,581
we'd be dangling there
like bait on a string.

397
00:27:30,646 --> 00:27:32,616
<i>It's suicide.</i>

398
00:27:32,681 --> 00:27:36,253
We don't have time for a debate, Mr. Logan.

399
00:27:36,318 --> 00:27:38,618
Now I gave you an order.

400
00:27:38,683 --> 00:27:41,981
And what happens when
those orders get us killed?

401
00:27:42,046 --> 00:27:44,787
<i>You send in four more?</i>

402
00:27:44,852 --> 00:27:47,326
Billy, tell him I'm right.

403
00:27:55,397 --> 00:27:56,826
Mr. Logan...

404
00:27:58,866 --> 00:28:01,300
fall in.

405
00:28:01,365 --> 00:28:03,269
Billy, tell him I'm right.

406
00:28:06,238 --> 00:28:07,477
Captain...

407
00:28:07,542 --> 00:28:11,012
Mr. Logan makes a valid point.

408
00:28:13,914 --> 00:28:17,344
Unfortunately, now is not the time.

409
00:28:17,417 --> 00:28:20,080
(crew gasps)

410
00:28:22,649 --> 00:28:24,456
Anybody else got a point

411
00:28:24,521 --> 00:28:27,289
they would like to make?

412
00:28:27,362 --> 00:28:28,964
While we are in battle,

413
00:28:29,029 --> 00:28:30,667
the captain's orders are the law.

414
00:28:30,732 --> 00:28:32,795
<i>That is what we signed up to.</i>

415
00:28:32,868 --> 00:28:35,099
<i>That is what we agreed.</i>

416
00:28:37,604 --> 00:28:40,171
Now the order's been given.

417
00:28:40,244 --> 00:28:41,811
Heed it!

418
00:28:48,483 --> 00:28:51,186
<i>(man whistles)</i>

419
00:28:51,251 --> 00:28:53,418
<i>Man: Captain!</i>

420
00:29:10,741 --> 00:29:12,644
I can't believe I didn't see it before.

421
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:15,210
It was staring us right in the face.

422
00:29:15,275 --> 00:29:18,944
Those cannons aren't the only thing
Bryson has locked down there with him.

423
00:29:22,482 --> 00:29:23,819
38 slaves.

424
00:29:23,884 --> 00:29:27,387
You think they put that
flag there as a signal to us?

425
00:29:27,453 --> 00:29:29,155
Well, it wasn't there three hours ago.

426
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,626
And if not us, I couldn't tell
you who they are trying to signal.

427
00:29:31,691 --> 00:29:33,658
Seven, eight...

428
00:29:33,731 --> 00:29:35,967
nine priced over £100.

429
00:29:36,032 --> 00:29:39,103
That's nine strong men ready
to fight Bryson from below.

430
00:29:39,168 --> 00:29:41,638
Yeah, well, you're presuming those nine men

431
00:29:41,703 --> 00:29:43,877
will choose to take up
arms and join in a fight

432
00:29:43,942 --> 00:29:46,443
they couldn't possibly
know or care less about.

433
00:29:46,508 --> 00:29:48,179
Given their current situation,

434
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:50,518
my presumption is that there
are no nine men on earth

435
00:29:50,583 --> 00:29:52,981
who wouldn't jump at the
chance for a little fight.

436
00:29:53,054 --> 00:29:56,388
What, you got a better idea?

437
00:29:58,187 --> 00:30:00,820
Well, how do you imagine we
get them out of their chains?

438
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,607
<i>Woman: You will never see them again.</i>

439
00:30:12,672 --> 00:30:14,871
What?

440
00:30:16,376 --> 00:30:18,775
This person you'd give
your life to protect,

441
00:30:18,848 --> 00:30:21,815
<i>give our lives to protect...</i>

442
00:30:23,584 --> 00:30:26,383
whoever they are, you'll
never see them again.

443
00:30:26,456 --> 00:30:29,223
You must love them very much,

444
00:30:29,288 --> 00:30:31,255
but I do not think you
have thought this through.

445
00:30:31,327 --> 00:30:33,055
You don't know me.

446
00:30:33,127 --> 00:30:35,830
And you don't know what
you're talking about.

447
00:30:35,896 --> 00:30:38,367
I know that if we reach our destination,

448
00:30:38,432 --> 00:30:40,463
we may never have another chance like this.

449
00:30:40,535 --> 00:30:42,270
There is no we.

450
00:30:44,103 --> 00:30:47,438
You and I, we are both in this hold,

451
00:30:47,503 --> 00:30:50,111
but we are not in the same place.

452
00:30:52,216 --> 00:30:54,679
How many times must you have told yourself

453
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:57,047
that you're special?

454
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:01,022
<i>That your master thinks
you're different from the rest?</i>

455
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,959
<i>Maybe you're right.</i>

456
00:31:04,024 --> 00:31:06,463
But I know those men above better than you.

457
00:31:06,528 --> 00:31:09,099
And when they put you in these,

458
00:31:09,164 --> 00:31:11,769
they don't mean to let you go.

459
00:31:14,601 --> 00:31:16,271
You have a chance to go home again,

460
00:31:16,336 --> 00:31:18,070
yet you just sit there.

461
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:21,542
Maybe you're right.

462
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,446
<i>You and I are not the same.</i>

463
00:31:35,188 --> 00:31:36,484
<i>(thumps)</i>

464
00:31:41,632 --> 00:31:43,831

465
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:47,668
(hisses)

466
00:31:58,377 --> 00:32:00,878
<i>(door opens)</i>

467
00:32:03,954 --> 00:32:06,489
What the fuck is going on down here?

468
00:32:19,974 --> 00:32:22,540
Sir.

469
00:32:22,613 --> 00:32:24,179
It's this one.

470
00:32:43,293 --> 00:32:45,669
(choking)

471
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:12,591

472
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:22,766
<i>(rhythmic thudding)</i>

00:33:25,534 --> 00:33:27,899
Men: Heave!

474
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:30,939
<i>- Man: Together, lads. And...
- Heave.</i>

475
00:33:32,004 --> 00:33:34,435
What do they think they're doing?

476
00:33:34,508 --> 00:33:37,140
<i>(thudding continues)</i>

477
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:47,117
Come.

478
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:55,335
<i>- Heave!
- Man: Again!</i>

479
00:33:57,169 --> 00:33:59,304
- (clangs)
- Heave!

480
00:34:08,283 --> 00:34:10,114
Put your back in it, boys!

481
00:34:11,387 --> 00:34:13,650
<i>(rhythmic thudding continues)</i>

482
00:34:22,898 --> 00:34:25,761
Secure the hold, Mr.
Hayes. Something's wrong.

483
00:34:25,833 --> 00:34:27,632
(whistles)

484
00:34:34,169 --> 00:34:36,344
(shouting)

485
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:44,712

<i>(urinating)</i>

492
00:36:15,036 --> 00:36:18,569
Excuse me. Mr. Hamund?

493
00:36:18,642 --> 00:36:20,107
Who the fuck are you?

494
00:36:20,172 --> 00:36:22,917
My name is John Silver.

495
00:36:22,982 --> 00:36:24,886
And I have a proposition for you.

496
00:36:24,951 --> 00:36:26,782
<i>I've heard your crew has
been freed to hunt again.</i>

497
00:36:26,853 --> 00:36:28,620
And I understand with
Mr. Rackham out of favor,

498
00:36:28,685 --> 00:36:30,252
you're the man the crew now looks to.

499
00:36:32,926 --> 00:36:35,325
Seems our paths were meant
to meet in this moment.

500
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:38,262
Me with something to sell,
and you with means to use it.

501
00:36:38,327 --> 00:36:40,628
Piss off.

502
00:36:43,593 --> 00:36:46,167
I was the whore's partner,

503
00:36:46,232 --> 00:36:48,368
the one who stole the page from Flint

504
00:36:48,433 --> 00:36:50,873
and then tried to sell it to you.

505
00:36:50,938 --> 00:36:53,378
You're that new one.

506
00:36:53,443 --> 00:36:55,808
- The cook they took on.
- That I am.

507
00:36:55,872 --> 00:36:57,173
But perhaps not for long.

508
00:36:57,238 --> 00:36:59,479
This is where I think you
and I can help each other.

509
00:37:01,585 --> 00:37:05,386
The night the exchange was meant
to take place at the wrecks,

510
00:37:05,451 --> 00:37:07,553
I lost the schedule to Captain Flint.

511
00:37:07,626 --> 00:37:10,318
But I escaped with my hide intact

512
00:37:10,391 --> 00:37:12,220
and my anonymity.

513
00:37:12,285 --> 00:37:13,853
I've remained with the crew since then,

514
00:37:13,926 --> 00:37:16,726
but I believe now I've
tempted fate long enough.

515
00:37:16,799 --> 00:37:18,695
Flint departed, I remained.

516
00:37:18,768 --> 00:37:20,700
My intent... to sell the page again

517
00:37:20,765 --> 00:37:23,299
and leave Nassau with
something to show for it.

518
00:37:23,364 --> 00:37:25,901
Seeing as we theoretically
already had a deal,

519
00:37:25,974 --> 00:37:28,543
I thought your crew was
the logical place to start.

520
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,914
What the fuck are you talking about?

521
00:37:31,979 --> 00:37:33,983
You just said Flint has the schedule.

522
00:37:34,049 --> 00:37:36,948
He has the page the schedule is written on,

523
00:37:37,013 --> 00:37:39,116
but I saw that page.

524
00:37:39,181 --> 00:37:41,788
I think there's a good chance
I can remember most of it.

525
00:37:41,854 --> 00:37:43,421
For the right price.

526
00:37:43,486 --> 00:37:46,053
Are you a fucking lunatic?

527
00:37:46,126 --> 00:37:47,957
What's to stop me from killing you

528
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,797
for getting us into this mess?

529
00:37:49,862 --> 00:37:51,461
Wait.

530
00:37:51,526 --> 00:37:54,164
I am willing to give a steep
discount on our original agreement.

531
00:37:54,229 --> 00:37:58,332
We don't have any fucking
money left, you shit.

532
00:37:58,405 --> 00:38:01,573
Rackham lost it chasing you.

533
00:38:02,974 --> 00:38:05,677
I fail to see how that's possible.

534
00:38:13,718 --> 00:38:16,926
Mr. Hamund. May I help you?

535
00:38:16,991 --> 00:38:20,558
You told us you lost
our pearls in the wrecks.

536
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:23,896
5,000 pesos worth. Isn't that right?

537
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:25,568
Yes.

538
00:38:25,633 --> 00:38:29,164
Because now I'm told that
you gave half our pearls

539
00:38:29,237 --> 00:38:31,100
to the whore up front

540
00:38:31,173 --> 00:38:33,973
<i>before you ever left for the wrecks.</i>

541
00:38:39,279 --> 00:38:43,814
Which would mean that half the
pearls never went to the wrecks.

542
00:38:46,889 --> 00:38:50,392
They was on the whore when
your bitch reeled her in.

543
00:38:52,193 --> 00:38:54,998
Leaving us to wonder

544
00:38:55,064 --> 00:38:57,063
where the fuck are they now?

545
00:38:59,665 --> 00:39:01,840
I don't know where you're
getting your information from,

546
00:39:01,905 --> 00:39:03,536
but I can assure you, it is mistaken.

547
00:39:03,609 --> 00:39:05,869
She threw that whore in the tent

548
00:39:05,942 --> 00:39:08,110
<i>long before we got to her.</i>

549
00:39:08,175 --> 00:39:10,376
Yes, but the whore had no pearls.

550
00:39:10,449 --> 00:39:13,955
<i>Neither I nor Miss Bonny would
be so stupid as to steal from you.</i>

551
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,622
And even if I were, I would
certainly never be so stupid

552
00:39:16,695 --> 00:39:18,494
as to trust a whore to act as escrow.

553
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,894
Someone is lying to you.

554
00:39:20,967 --> 00:39:23,965
<i>If you tell me who it was, I might
be able to help you figure out why.</i>

555
00:39:25,965 --> 00:39:28,868
I'd tell you, Jack...

556
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:31,836
<i>but I don't see how that much matters</i>

557
00:39:31,909 --> 00:39:34,677
<i>seeing that we found these</i>

558
00:39:34,742 --> 00:39:37,709
in your tent just now.

559
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:42,882
Look at you now.

560
00:39:44,386 --> 00:39:46,881
Where's the fucking rest of them?

561
00:39:47,954 --> 00:39:50,354
Buried.

562
00:39:50,419 --> 00:39:52,058
By the wrecks.

563
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:56,259
Darling.

564
00:39:56,332 --> 00:39:58,592
I'm so very disappointed in you.

565
00:40:18,985 --> 00:40:21,351
I believe I'm entitled to this.

566
00:40:27,058 --> 00:40:29,728
I've arranged a room for you.

567
00:40:29,793 --> 00:40:31,862
I don't imagine I'll be doing much sleeping

568
00:40:31,927 --> 00:40:34,964
till I know this is
finished, thank you very much.

569
00:40:35,029 --> 00:40:37,395
Thought I'd wait it out
here, if you don't mind.

570
00:40:44,546 --> 00:40:46,408
- Men: Heave ho!
- Pull!

571
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,142
Come on! That's it!

572
00:40:49,215 --> 00:40:51,676
Heave!

573
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:53,715
<i>Man: All right, lads, coming over.</i>

574
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:55,347
<i>Man 2: Coming over.</i>

575
00:40:55,412 --> 00:40:56,851
<i>Man 3: Okay, that's good.</i>

576
00:40:56,916 --> 00:40:59,786
(shouting continues)

577
00:41:03,292 --> 00:41:06,227
I certainly didn't expect
to find you down in the hold.

578
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:10,866
Not after you betrayed Miss
Guthrie on behalf of her father.

579
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:17,737
Our agreement was I would stay
behind to protect Eleanor from you.

580
00:41:17,802 --> 00:41:19,770
(scoffs)

581
00:41:19,836 --> 00:41:22,907
You think what she and I hope to achieve

582
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,516
for Nassau is impossible.

583
00:41:25,581 --> 00:41:27,381
That I'll be the death of her?

584
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:36,720
I lost six men chasing down this ship.

585
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:39,562
Nearly faced another mutiny all over again.

586
00:41:41,395 --> 00:41:43,866
If I had any sense, I'd
throw you to my crew.

587
00:41:43,931 --> 00:41:46,559
Take the pressure off me.

588
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,935
But I'm not gonna do that.

589
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,335
I'd rather prove you wrong.

590
00:42:18,165 --> 00:42:19,564
Billy.

591
00:42:22,069 --> 00:42:23,604
Stow the guns in the lower hold.

592
00:42:23,677 --> 00:42:26,170
- Favor the starboard.
- Of course.

593
00:42:26,242 --> 00:42:28,210
Right, Billy.

594
00:42:32,549 --> 00:42:35,517
What? Afraid I got loose lips?

595
00:42:38,855 --> 00:42:41,157
Please, son, I am on your side.

596
00:42:41,222 --> 00:42:43,190
You've got to believe that.

597
00:42:43,263 --> 00:42:46,094
Then get some answers.

598
00:42:51,466 --> 00:42:53,801
<i>Man: Come on!</i>

599
00:42:53,866 --> 00:42:57,073
<i>- Heave!
- Crew: Heave ho.</i>

600
00:42:57,138 --> 00:42:59,809
That's it. Hold on.

601
00:43:03,575 --> 00:43:04,838
Lend a hand, mate.

602
00:43:04,911 --> 00:43:06,646
Perfectly good stash of powder here.

603
00:43:09,583 --> 00:43:11,412
(screams)

604
00:43:16,944 --> 00:43:18,984
<i>- (men shouting, screaming)
- (Coughs)</i>

605
00:43:22,658 --> 00:43:24,858
You all right?

606
00:43:29,464 --> 00:43:31,063
She saw us.

607
00:43:31,128 --> 00:43:33,527
<i>The Scarborough had to have seen us.</i>

608
00:43:35,832 --> 00:43:37,935
There's still great guns in the hold.

609
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,936
At least three or four more.

610
00:43:40,009 --> 00:43:41,978
There's no time for delay.

611
00:43:42,043 --> 00:43:44,476
The guns we've unloaded
already will have to suffice.

612
00:43:44,549 --> 00:43:47,347
Cut us loose! We're getting out of here.

613
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:49,818
(men shouting)

614
00:44:01,303 --> 00:44:02,997
<i>Man: Come on!</i>

615
00:44:17,181 --> 00:44:19,116
What the hell is that?

616
00:44:20,549 --> 00:44:22,821
It's the Andromache's spritsail brace.

617
00:44:22,886 --> 00:44:24,757
<i>It must have blown loose
during the explosion.</i>

618
00:44:24,822 --> 00:44:27,493
That's two knots or
more it'll drag us down.

619
00:44:47,481 --> 00:44:51,050
Earlier...

620
00:44:51,123 --> 00:44:53,459
when you and Mr. Gates were having words,

621
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,564
you mentioned a letter.

622
00:44:58,230 --> 00:44:59,797
What was in it, Billy?

623
00:45:10,214 --> 00:45:12,308
Billy!

624
00:45:12,381 --> 00:45:14,211
What was in it?

625
00:45:17,518 --> 00:45:20,821
I think you know what was in it.

626
00:45:22,421 --> 00:45:24,619
<i>(cannon fire)</i>

627
00:45:25,922 --> 00:45:27,457
Oh, shit!

628
00:45:30,294 --> 00:45:34,040
(men shouting, screaming)

629
00:45:34,105 --> 00:45:36,535
Hard to starboard. Bring us about.

630
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:44,379
Man overboard!

631
00:45:44,444 --> 00:45:48,016
<i>Man: Man overboard!</i>

632
00:45:49,721 --> 00:45:52,487
It's Billy. He fell.

633
00:45:54,287 --> 00:45:56,654
- Billy!
- Billy!

634
00:45:56,727 --> 00:45:58,693
Any sign of him?

635
00:46:07,567 --> 00:46:09,372
We can't turn back.

636
00:46:14,142 --> 00:46:16,446
She'll tear us to pieces.

637
00:46:44,605 --> 00:46:46,038
Ambush, I presume.

638
00:46:46,111 --> 00:46:49,675
<i>Nothing out there but men
with pistols and swords.</i>

639
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:52,780
I imagine those pearls didn't
just materialize out of thin air.

640
00:46:52,845 --> 00:46:54,517
With whom did you scheme this?

641
00:46:54,582 --> 00:46:56,286
The cunt.

642
00:46:56,352 --> 00:46:57,958
(scoffs)

643
00:46:58,023 --> 00:47:00,326
Somehow I'm not surprised.

644
00:47:02,463 --> 00:47:04,358
Decent fellow, Slade, as far as I know.

645
00:47:04,431 --> 00:47:06,399
Never raised a hand against the whore.

646
00:47:06,464 --> 00:47:08,704
A factor I hope you considered
before you decided that he

647
00:47:08,769 --> 00:47:11,444
<i>and six other men who stood by
our captain in his darkest hour,</i>

648
00:47:11,509 --> 00:47:13,479
men he considers his brothers,

649
00:47:13,544 --> 00:47:16,676
be lumped into the cost of assuaging
your offense in this matter.

650
00:47:17,917 --> 00:47:19,715
God damn it, Anne.

651
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:22,017
Do I not deserve a say about this?

652
00:47:23,913 --> 00:47:26,048
You had your say.

653
00:47:26,121 --> 00:47:28,256
Now I'll have mine.

654
00:47:46,305 --> 00:47:48,442
This way.

655
00:48:01,287 --> 00:48:03,623
<i>(bird screeching)</i>

656
00:48:15,797 --> 00:48:18,134
You know, when I first met you,

657
00:48:18,207 --> 00:48:20,839
I pegged you for an easy mark.

658
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:24,740
But now, between you and Flint,

659
00:48:24,805 --> 00:48:27,076
I'm not certain who I
should be more afraid of.

660
00:48:32,322 --> 00:48:34,255
I saw you earlier.

661
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,517
After you lifted the ban.

662
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:43,495
(chuckles) You were angry.

663
00:48:44,632 --> 00:48:46,769
Not just about Max.

664
00:48:49,439 --> 00:48:51,575
Those men out there,

665
00:48:51,641 --> 00:48:53,577
they made you admit you were wrong.

666
00:48:54,714 --> 00:48:55,914
<i>They made you feel weak.</i>

667
00:49:00,112 --> 00:49:02,549
I think you felt compelled

668
00:49:02,614 --> 00:49:05,349
to let everyone on this island know

669
00:49:05,414 --> 00:49:08,560
that in this place,

670
00:49:08,625 --> 00:49:12,258
no one fucks with you
and gets away with it.

678
00:50:22,433 --> 00:50:24,767

I see. We won't be speaking
of this again, I presume.

685
00:52:24,622 --> 00:52:27,252
Well, before we close the lid
on this and put it in the ground,

686
00:52:27,325 --> 00:52:28,861
one last question if you will,

687
00:52:28,926 --> 00:52:30,725
just to satisfy my curiosity.

688
00:52:34,133 --> 00:52:36,532
When you and Miss Guthrie
were plotting this little coup,

689
00:52:36,597 --> 00:52:39,269
<i>when she asked you, "Well, shit, Anne,</i>

690
00:52:39,334 --> 00:52:41,701
what makes you think old Jack will
go along with this plan of ours

691
00:52:41,774 --> 00:52:43,173
and not plead the truth to his men

692
00:52:43,238 --> 00:52:45,906
as he's most certainly going
to feel duty-bound to do?"

693
00:52:45,970 --> 00:52:48,809
<i>What did you say?</i>

694
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:51,912
I told her given the choice
between them and me...

695
00:52:53,745 --> 00:52:55,176
you'd choose me.

696
00:52:56,987 --> 00:52:58,723
That's very fucking touching.

697
00:53:02,019 --> 00:53:03,426
And the captain?

698
00:53:03,491 --> 00:53:05,690
The two of you come up with
some idea how to deal with him

699
00:53:05,763 --> 00:53:07,697
when he returns and
finds out about all this?

700
00:53:09,665 --> 00:53:12,467
You don't know where he's gone, do you?

701
00:53:16,837 --> 00:53:18,508
He ain't coming back.
