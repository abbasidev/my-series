Oh, my God. Tony.

Ohhh.

Opps.

What?

13
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:48,834
- Look at the ring your father gave me.
- I already saw it.

14
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:52,379
I was gonna wrap it,
but it's wasteful.

15

Thank you, young man.

What are you doing here?

22
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:15,652
- Nice to see you too.
- Sorry, I'm just surprised to see you.

23
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:19,198
See what your father got me?

We can go together.
I put it on your credit card.

29
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:49,186
- Twelve years. This club was nothing.
- Give him a drink.

30
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:52,856
- What do you drink, Rocco?
- Johnny Black.

31
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:56,610
- This place was a shithole.
- You could use some help.

32
00:03:56,778 --> 00:04:01,782
- Make this place into 21st century.
- Yeah, it's permanently 1987 in here.

That's all he had to do.
One little kick and now I'm ruined?

No bitch to me.

- Did you invite a stray dog?
- You short of food?

00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:40,028
- Sorry I'm late.
- We didn't know you were coming.

44

- Meadow said it's Carmela's birthday.
- It's nice of you.

I heard you got made
defensive captain.

I have two recovered fumbles.
Almost scored with one.

56
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:38,879
Excellent. I played linebacker
for Boonton. I was All County.

57
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,798
- Wow.
- Maybe we could work out together.

58
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:46,011
Sure. You should come to the game
Tuesday. It's the last one.

59
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:50,098
- We were supposed to play last month.
- I'll be there.

I wanna come too.
My brother's football game.

No champagne.
The Lord doesn't want us to drink.

- Didn't Jesus drink wine?
- He was Jesus. We can't compare.

Who invented these things?

Mom, can I sleep at Egon's
if I'm in bed by 1?

I got one for you
for when you're at the market.

Lights out by 1, in bed by 12.

- I smell fish.
- We're near the ocean.

Now I smell piss.

00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:02,546
Okay.

71

- What?
- It's yours.

72
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:10,804
What is?

73
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:14,307
The Lollipop in Long Branch.
This is your club.

74
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:20,897
I'm a partner here, me and Furio.
We'll be silent.

75
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,233
You'll be the owner/manager.

76
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:29,030
You book the bands, find the talent,
whatever you want to do. It's yours.

Oh, my God.

I can't believe it.

You'll make this place the biggest
Jersey club since the Stoned Pony.

Thank you, Christopher.
I'm so excited.

- Can we change the name?
- Whatever you want, baby.

00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:02,481
This is Rocco. He works for you.

83
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,246
The ring looks beautiful on you.

84
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,957
It is gorgeous.

85
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,879
- Anything you need to tell me?
- About the ring?

86
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,048
I don't know.

87
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:33,386
- You didn't buy that little car.
- The Mercedes?

88
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:38,808
- I'd look like a douche bag.
- Jean calls those mid-life crisis cars.

89
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:41,102
What the fuck does she know?

90
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:50,779
- Is this 1726 Pearl Avenue?
- No.

91
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:55,200
- Is Pearl Avenue in this neighborhood?
- I don't know.

92
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:58,537
Do you know a man
by the name of La Fong?

93
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,289
Hello? Hey, Ro.

94
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,252
No, Jackie took Meadow to the movies.

95
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,630
He said not late.

96
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:12,717
All right. Fine.

97
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,979
What?

98
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,733
I'm not thrilled about this thing
with Jackie and Meadow.

99
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:32,195
I think she came home
so they could go out.

100
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:36,157
So what? He's a good kid.
Comes from good stock.

101
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:41,496
He's on his best behavior. I don't
picture Meadow with someone like him.

102
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,790
Someone like him?

103
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,376
He's one of us.

104
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:51,464
Were you happy when she was with
Jamal Ginsberg, the Hasidic homeboy?

105
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:57,178
Scraped through that
by the skin of our ass.

106
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:01,308
I just don't want her to miss
any opportunities.

107
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:04,811
She should be at the museum
in her free time.

108
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,688
Not watching TV.

109
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:11,318
You'd rather she look at soup cans
than be close to home?

110
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,028
I don't know.

111
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,575
Well, you talk to her,
and I'll talk to Jackie Jr.

112
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,579
Here's your Edgar Allan Poe paper.

113
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,957
- You did it already?
- No problem.

114
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,542
Thanks.

115
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:34,424
I would've done it. I was gonna do it.
I just couldn't get through the books.

116
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,969
I never should've took
Literature of Obsession.

117
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,180
I owe you big time.

118
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:41,723
Thanks.

119
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:54,027
- How can I repay you?
- I don't know.

120
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:57,364
Why don't you surprise me?

121
00:10:57,865 --> 00:11:01,743
On your mark, get set, go!

122
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,254
- I kicked your ass.
- You cheat.

123
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,798
Oh, my eye.

124
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:22,472
There's too much chlorine.
I swallowed some water.

125
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,809
- You girls see me?
- Yeah, you were cheating.

126
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,602
I'm fucking starving.

127
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:32,607
Hey, guys! We got Mr. Goodwin's
office open. Check it out.

128
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,573
Let's go for it.

129
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,838
Hey, everybody.

130
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,428
Shit!

131
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,684
All right! Come on, let's go!

132
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,439
Don't cut your feet!

133
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:18,361
- Hey, it's Sunday morning and...
- Good morning.

134
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,072
- Hello.
- Morning.

135
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,284
- Did Jackie call?
- He's with your brother.

136
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,222
So I've been thinking about a car.

137
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:51,394
- I knew I'd get hit up on this trip.
- You buy sapphires...

138
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:54,189
...but a student has to take the bus?

139
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,858
What do you need a car for?

140
00:12:57,109 --> 00:13:01,446
It'd be nice to hop in a car
and come have dinner with you.

141
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:06,576
They steal cars in New York.
Parking is impossible...

142
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:11,748
- The bus gets you here in 45 minutes.
- I'm not asking for anything fancy.

143
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:16,836
- Could've had a car last year.
- Eric's car? Is that a sick joke?

144
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:20,632
His father's now
in a mental health facility.

145
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:25,470
See how this semester goes.
You have a lot of work to do.

146
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,430
Concentrate on that.

147
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,810
I am concentrating on that!
Christ, you're a broken record!

148
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:34,813
- Take it down a notch.
- God.

149
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:39,400
We wanna make sure you take
advantage of all the city offers.

150
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,986
Culturally, socially...

151
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,614
...educationally.

152
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,996
Right before the snap,
the ball is still.

153
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:57,252
But the qb's eyes can tell you
whether he'll pass or hand it off.

154
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:02,465
It happens in a split second.
But you can learn what his habits are.

155
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:05,301
Once you know these habits,
he's fucked.

156
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,096
Hey.

157
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,764
Good morning.

158
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:13,768
- A.J., try what I told you.
- I will. Thanks, Jackie.

159
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:31,661
The wall of pride.
What kind of animals...?

160
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:36,457
They didn't steal anything.
They just did a number on the place.

161
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,460
They left this.

162
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:58,813
You make this pizza?

163
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:03,443
- Who made this?
- We're asking you.

164
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,904
This your store logo, sir?

165
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:09,574
- That's my box.
- It was at a crime scene.

166
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:13,828
My pizza never hurt nobody.
You no find any bacteria here.

167
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:17,332
Kids broke into the high school.
They left this.

168
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:22,629
- Tell me who, I'll kick their asses.
- I got it, Pop.

169
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,882
That's a custom job.

170
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:29,135
Meatball, pepperoni, sausage
peppers, onions...

171
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:32,180
...extra mozzarella...
This pie fit a pattern?

172
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:35,391
- Anyone order this regularly?
- Only one.

173
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,393
- Who?
- I'd rather not say.

174
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:41,898
- Tell me! I find these bastards!
- Pop, go in the back. Go ahead.

175
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,608
- Sir.
- Yes, officer?

176
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:48,529
Word to the wise. Technically,
you're an accessory after the fact.

177
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:53,910
I cannot believe this.
Do you know how serious this is?

178
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,412
Do you?

179
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,582
- Answer me right now.
- Yes.

180
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,043
- Yes, what?
- I know it's serious.

181
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:04,045
So why did you do it?

182
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:07,006
- I don't know.
- Why did you do it?

183
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:10,843
Do you hate the school
or have a problem with someone?

184
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,763
- No.
- Then why?

185
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,223
It just happened.

186
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:19,686
We went in as a goof.
Someone threw something in the pool.

187
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:24,565
A couple of guys started
throwing stuff in. We just did it.

188
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:29,779
And if they were jumping off a bridge,
would you just do that too?

189
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,864
No.

190
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,702
What are you doing here?

191
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:39,372
- Answer your father.
- I got sent home.

192
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,332
Why?

193
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,211
Why?

194
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,047
I got in trouble.

195
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:52,468
Your son broke into his school
and vandalized the pool.

196
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:57,515
- How do you vandalize a pool?
- They threw stuff in, broke things.

197
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:00,351
- Why'd you do that?
- Screwing around.

198
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:03,146
On your mother's birthday?

199
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:08,192
- It wasn't. It was after midnight.
- What are you, fucking stupid? Huh?

200
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,695
- So you're suspended?
- I don't know.

201
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,281
This is serious.
He may be expelled.

202
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:16,534
- What'd they say?
- Nothing. They sent me home.

203
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:21,080
- You have to go see the principal.
- On your mother's birthday.

204
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,334
They're gonna call you.

205
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,463
Just when everything
was going good, huh?

206
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:30,923
You're gonna miss the big game.

207
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:34,594
You're screwing everything up.
Your football career down the drain!

208
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,479
- Wow.
- There it is.

209
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,564
- Beautiful ring.
- I know.

210
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:50,818
- Gorgeous, Carm.
- I want you ladies to try this.

211
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:54,655
Mozzarella? I was gonna
get the hot antipasto.

212
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:59,702
It's not mozzarella. This is burrata.
I had it flown in from Italy.

213
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:03,748
It's more subtle than mozzarella,
with a nutty flavor.

214
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:06,000
- Thanks.
- I'm not big on nuts.

215
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:10,171
A little pepper? Carm, on your half?

216
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:14,884
It's all about the contrast:
Crisp beans and smooth cheese.

217
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:19,430
- No, I'm fine.
- Buon appetito.

218
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:26,854
Tastes like mozzarella
and string beans. You have it, Carm.

219
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,899
I want the hot antipasto.

220
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:35,863
I'd like to make a toast. To the
friendship between our two children.

221
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,784
I'm happy to see my son
spending time with Meadow.

222
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,745
She'll be a good influence on him.

223
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:48,835
- You did a great job. She's wonderful.
- Well, thank you. Salute.

224
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:56,175
It's nice to see our families united.
Like with Ralphie.

225
00:18:56,385 --> 00:19:01,305
He goes on and on about Tony.
He's happy to be getting closer to him.

226
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:06,144
- Ralph is a real find, hang on to him.
- It was tough at first.

227
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:11,315
I was afraid everyone was gonna think
that I didn't mourn Jack enough.

228
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:15,153
Oh, Artie!

229
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:21,033
He's under a lot of stress.
I hear Charmaine hired a lawyer.

230
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,910
Divorce?

231
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:27,331
It's funny, but you think, you know...

232
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:32,879
...the men in our lives have been,
you know what, and we stay together.

233
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:36,215
And here's Artie, a regular guy,
hardworking...

234
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:39,010
...his marriage is in the pisciatoio.

235
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:44,182
- You can push a man only so far.
- True. Very true.

236
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:58,112
If you wait inside for me,
I'll be in there in a second. Okay?

237
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:04,160
Hello.

238
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:08,789
- Who's the douche bag?
- He buys a new 600 for me every year.

239
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,876
- This was last year.
- Nice.

240
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:19,175
You been shopping?

241
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,344
It's for you.

242
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:36,484
- It's very beautiful.
- So are you.

243
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:41,697
What are my chances
of kidnapping you for the afternoon?

244
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,118
- I'm closing on a car.
- Come on.

245
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:52,124
Let Hans and Franz do the paperwork.
I'm going nuts thinking about you.

246
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,461
I've gotta work.

247
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,345
- Trabajar?
- Come on...

248
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,806
I'll take you anywhere you want.

249
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:12,520
The Pierre, Sherry Netherlands.
Come on, anywhere you wanna go.

250
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:17,316
You wanna go to the zoo?

251
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:20,528
- The zoo?
- Yeah.

252
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:24,198
- I try to get there once a year.
- We'll go.

253
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:28,536
I'll call you.

254
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:40,506
Amazing thing about snakes is that
they reproduce spontaneously.

255
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,008
What do you mean?

256
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:44,927
They have male and female
sex organs.

257
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:47,847
Somebody you don't trust,
you call a snake.

258
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:53,436
How can you trust a guy who can
literally go fuck themselves?

259
00:21:54,771 --> 00:22:00,359
Don't you think that expression came
from when the snake tempted Eve?

260
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,695
Hey, snakes
were fucking themselves...

261
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,698
...long before Adam and Eve
showed up, T.

262
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,462
- How you doing?
- All right.

263
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:23,507
Hey, Jackie, thanks for coming by.
How are you?

264
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:27,470
Have a seat. Want something to drink?

265
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,930
- What are you having?
- Red wine.

266
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:35,603
- I'll get some slices. Want anything?
- Yeah, get me the usual.

267
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:40,608
- Jackie, you want something?
- No, thanks.

268
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:49,742
- You're taking Meadow out tonight.
- Yeah.

269
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:53,579
- Where?
- A place called Chez Josephine.

270
00:22:54,206 --> 00:23:00,169
They have live piano music.
Harry Connick Jr. used to play there.

271
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,797
A friend of mine is the bartender.

272
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:06,509
- Don't you two got class?
- She's got a 2:00. I'm off.

273
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,887
How many days off they give you
at Rutgers?

274
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,558
I got class three days a week.

275
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,269
Listen...

276
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,563
...I think you're a good kid.

277
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:22,983
You show respect
and come from a good family.

278
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:24,568
Thanks.

279
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,279
As far as my daughter goes...

280
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,990
...you know I want the best for her.

281
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,536
I'm gonna be very protective over her.

282
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:36,038
- You understand, right?
- Of course.

283
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:41,585
If you wanna spend time with her,
I want the best from you in school.

284
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,713
- Yeah, right. I know it...
- Shut up.

285
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:46,882
Listen to me.

286
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:53,139
I know I've been saying this to you
all along, but now it's different.

287
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:56,267
- Understand?
- I just got an A on a paper.

288
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,686
You did?

289
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:03,607
Edgar Allan Poe. Good writer,
what a fucking nut job.

290
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:07,903
He's the guy who did all
the Vincent Price shit, right?

291
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:12,324
He smoked opium and married
his cousin. He was from the Bronx.

292
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:16,245
- So you got an A, huh?
- I'm doing good, Tony.

293
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,998
Let's keep it that way.

294
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:23,794
- Keep your father in mind.
- I will.

295
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,341
Listen...

296
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:30,968
...here.

297
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:36,182
- Have some dessert on me.
- That's okay.

298
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:37,558
Take it.

299
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:43,439
- Don't keep her out too late.
- I won't. Thanks, Tony.

300
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:57,995
Welcome, everybody,
to opening night at Crazy Horse.

301
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:03,417
I'm excited to have, from U-Dub,
our very first band.

302
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:08,422
Please welcome the Miami Relatives!

303
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:19,517
(FEMALE SINGING VOCALS)

304
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,678
- What do you think?
- What?

305
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:59,431
- What do you think?
- I can't hear a word you say.

306
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:04,228
Tony and Sil couldn't make it,
but this is from us. Congratulations.

307
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,778
- Do you like the band?
- What?

308
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:15,197
How do you like the band?

309
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:26,625
- Matush, you don't got the Maseratis?
- Versace. You try it yet?

310
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:29,169
No, I liked the Maserati.

311
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:34,466
- Try the Versace, you won't be sorry.
- All right, give me four.

312
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:39,346
- What's up?!
- Come on. Let's go. Out.

313
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:44,143
I got friends here, man!
Let me call my man Carlo!

314
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:47,980
I see you here again,
I'm gonna crack your head.

315
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,816
Call Carlo!

316
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:03,537
You have to wonder
what they're thinking.

317
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:08,459
They're thinking, "Madonna,
you guys ever smell yourselves?"

318
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,045
You're probably right, huh?

319
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,589
Except for you.

320
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,343
What you got on
even a baboon would love.

321
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:20,846
The eyes are innocent.

322
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:23,891
Like a baby's.

323
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:27,519
Yeah, he could innocently
maul you into ten pieces.

324
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:32,024
Usually they just engage
in what's called threat behavior.

325
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:36,570
Because they did their mauling.
Now they just give the look.

326
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:37,821
Malocchio.

327
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:44,495
You know why they're primates?
They groom each other.

328
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:47,081
That I like.

329
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,126
What's this?

330
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:54,046
It's a Tibetan talisman
for protection.

331
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:58,926
I knew it. I knew there
had to be something.

332
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:01,428
What?

333
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:06,058
- What's wrong? It's a Buddhist symbol.
- My sister was a Buddhist.

334
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:10,979
- She's a wack job.
- I see, so I gotta be a wack job too?

335
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:14,858
It is a little wacky.
What's wrong with Catholicism?

336
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:18,987
Which you fucking practice
every fucking day, I'm sure.

337
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:22,616
So I pray a little,
and I meditate in the morning.

338
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:27,788
It clears my mind and my heart
for the day.

339
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:32,793
A Buddhist selling $150,000 cars.

340
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:38,549
The first noble truth is:
Life is suffering.

341
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:43,762
But the Buddha preached participation
in the sorrows of the world.

342
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:48,851
You make a sale, you don't make
a sale, it's a tiny little thing.

343
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:04,116
- What's so funny?
- You came here.

344
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:07,161
- What, the zoo?
- I said zoo and you came.

345
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:11,123
What's this, a fucking head-trip now?
Huh? Nice.

346
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:12,916
Sort of.

347
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:16,545
- I don't like that.
- You're very sweet.

348
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:19,757
You came.

349
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,928
I'm crazy about you.

350
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:29,850
- You know that, don't you?
- I never met anybody like you.

351
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:40,402
Okay, class, come this way.
Stay together, kids. Come on.

352
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:43,447
We're gonna see some tigers.

353
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:49,620
- Do you take your kids to the zoo?
- Yeah.

354
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:51,413
And now we're here.

355
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:55,292
See you later.

356
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:57,461
- Who was that?
- My hard-on.

357
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:07,888
Between the Buddhism
and talk about the family, poor you.

358
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:15,771
Let me see if it's really gone.

359
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,689
You lie.

360
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:33,455
- You know snakes can fuck themselves?
- Give me your hand.

361
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,755
Oh, Jesus Christ.

362
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:09,241
- Don't move.
- What?

363
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,285
See...

364
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:13,203
...if you...

365
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:16,081
...can not...

366
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,265
So, what happened?

367
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:37,269
He was at the Crazy Horse
and some zip told my man:

368
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,438
New management, new rules.

369
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:44,818
So I asked around. I heard about
some guy, Multi-something.

370
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:49,615
Some guy in the Soprano family
was running things. I go, "Whoa!"

371
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:52,034
- Chris Moltisanti.
- Yeah.

372
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,703
I know Chris.

373
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,791
- What's your name again?
- Matush.

374
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:07,215
Normally I would never get involved
with a stranger.

375
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:10,510
If Carlo here is vouching for you...

376
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,640
- I'm willing to make an exception.
- Thank you.

377
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,600
What'd I tell you?

378
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:22,272
- You know who my father was?
- The golfer? U.S. Open?

379
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:28,737
Chris and me are associates.
You got nothing to worry about.

380
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:32,157
I'll call Carlo in a couple days.

381
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:35,702
Meeting over.

382
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:40,624
Verbum Dei has a zero tolerance
policy in cases of vandalism.

383
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:44,252
It demands the expulsion
of the offending student.

384
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:46,213
I told him.

385
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,341
- You see?
- Having said that...

386
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:52,928
In this case,
after much deliberation...

387
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:55,806
...we decided upon
a suspended sentence.

388
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,891
This has been arrived at...

389
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:02,646
...based on his academic performance.
And his involvement in sports.

390
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:07,317
- His academic performance?
- He's brought his GPA to a C-minus.

391
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:10,654
- What is the punishment?
- We suggest and hope...

392
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:12,864
...it's meted out parentally.

393
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:17,119
- So it's not exactly zero tolerance.
- Each child is special.

394
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:22,749
- That's a principle of this school.
- Well, what about detention?

395
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:26,503
A lawsuit forced us
to eliminate detention.

396
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:29,798
- He's off the football team, right?
- No.

397
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:35,137
Studies at Harvard
have shown that boys...

398
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:41,601
...have success in avoiding pitfalls
when they remain involved in sport.

399
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:45,856
You better wipe that smile
off your face.

400
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:50,235
I told him he'd be off the team.

401
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:54,197
- You know, now you're kind of...
- Undermining the...

402
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:59,578
It's not only skill Anthony has shown
on the field, it's leadership as well.

403
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:06,501
We feel it's against his interests to
sever his relationship with the squad.

404
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:11,506
- Well, if you think that's best.
- However...

405
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:16,428
...I can't say this strongly enough.
If there is one more infraction...

406
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:22,350
...the sentence will go into effect
and Anthony will be expelled.

407
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:27,189
- Do you understand this, Anthony?
- Yes.

408
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:31,526
- You completely sold us out in there.
- What'd I do?

409
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:35,113
They're not punishing him,
and you went along.

410
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:36,990
I suggested detention.

411
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:41,536
That was a charade so the football
team can win the big game.

412
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:45,916
We've been waiting for years
for him to get off the couch.

413
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:50,587
We should keep this in the family.
He ain't getting off that easy.

414
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:54,382
Overall it's been a good two weeks.

415
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:58,303
- What about the nightmares?
- None.

416
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:05,769
I had a dream where I lit
the big torch at the Olympics.

417
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,106
- What do you think that represented?
- Well...

418
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:11,983
...work has been good.

419
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:15,112
My sales are way up.

420
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:17,948
And my performance
has been commended...

421
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:21,201
...by Mercedes-Benz USA
with a plaque.

422
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:26,206
- What's going on with your social life?
- Nothing.

423
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:30,168
Right now.

424
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,464
But it's okay.

425
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:42,222
What I'm going to say is a little
delicate, but I think it's important.

426
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:47,227
When you called me last week
to cancel, I heard a man's voice.

427
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:52,440
My car broke down.

428
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,487
It could've been the mechanic.

429
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,739
I see.

430
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:11,626
- I'm offended you put it that way.
- Offended? Why?

431
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:15,797
Well, I don't pay you
to be under your surveillance.

432
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,009
How dare you?

433
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:24,806
You came to me after attempting
suicide over the breakup with Barry.

434
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:29,144
I ask you because
you're under my care.

435
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:32,856
It's unprofessional
to confront me this way.

436
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:36,109
Suicide is something
I take very seriously.

437
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:40,614
The doctor in the ER said
it was only suicidal ideation.

438
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:44,868
- Is he trained to give those diagnoses?
- My car broke down.

439
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:47,120
Fine.

440
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:52,209
- I'll believe you.
- Thank you.

441
00:36:55,630 --> 00:37:00,008
- To the Crazy Horse, buona fortuna.
- Salute.

442
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:05,055
Club business ain't easy, I tell you.

443
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:09,893
With the Bing, everybody only sees
the glitz and glamour.

444
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:12,354
Nobody knows what goes into it.

445
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:15,523
There's a lot to deal with, I know.

446
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,568
See, it's one thing to have a bar.

447
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:21,613
When you're dealing
with performers...

448
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:27,118
I don't care if it's music, tits,
fire-eaters. It's a whole other game.

449
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:27,911
(PHONE RINGING)

450
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:32,374
Ultimately you're relying on them
to get the customers in...

451
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:35,043
...and spend money.

452
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:39,130
All right. I'll take it upstairs.

453
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:49,432
- Jackie, how are you?
- All right.

454
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:56,398
- How you doing?
- Somebody's sitting there.

455
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,950
7 and 7 and whatever my friend wants.

456
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,201
I'm good.

457
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:11,496
- Just 7 and 7.
- Okay.

458
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,291
Congrats on the club.

459
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:18,211
I admire your progress
since you got your button.

460
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:25,051
I wanted to have a sit down
with you about a friend.

461
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:27,554
- When did you wanna do this?
- Now.

462
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:30,140
Now's okay to chat,
not a sit down.

463
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:36,604
This friend was moving X at the club,
and he got thrown out on his ass.

464
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:38,440
And?

465
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:45,113
I wanted to ask you, as a favor, to
let him keep a little action going on.

466
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:51,911
- You get a piece of what he does.
- X is federal territory now.

467
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,707
- I don't want it in my club.
- It would mean a lot to me.

468
00:38:57,251 --> 00:39:01,338
You've got a lot of balls.
Did you hear what I said?

469
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,673
What'd I say?

470
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:06,885
- No.
- End of chat.

471
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:09,095
Okay, thanks.

472
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:35,080
- It's all taken care of.
- Thanks, man.

473
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:40,585
You just can't do it in the club. Have
your customers meet you outside.

474
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:46,216
- Outside where?
- Use your car. Or their car.

475
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:49,969
Find an alley...
I gotta think it all out for you?

476
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:52,597
That's gonna make things harder.

477
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:57,894
This all happens for a good reason.
Beyond anything you could know.

478
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:06,361
In time, everything will be revealed.
You'll be back inside. Don't worry.

479
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:11,282
If that's the way it is,
that's the way it is. I'll see you.

480
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:14,160
Aren't you forgetting something?

481
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,162
What?

482
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:20,250
I'm looking out for you here.
I gotta eat too, right?

483
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:24,003
Yeah, sure. I'll take care of you.

484
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:28,341
- I'll be by every Sunday.
- Cool.

485
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:41,896
Your father and I
discussed your punishment.

486
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:44,399
You're grounded for a month.

487
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:47,527
No Nintendo, no DVDs,
no skateboards.

488
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:50,029
- No computer.
- I use it for school.

489
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:53,032
- Get the typewriter.
- Dad threw it out.

490
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:57,620
Then use a pen.
It worked for Einstein.

491
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:01,541
And you're gonna work your ass
off around here.

492
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:04,043
- Okay.
- You got no choice.

493
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:09,549
- Go to the garage and organize it.
- Jackie Jr. did that the other day.

494
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,595
See what I'm saying about him?

495
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:17,599
Take a lesson from Jackie
and get your act together.

496
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:21,936
Kid's pre-med at Rutgers,
he finds time to help out.

497
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:25,773
- And you're going to clean the gutters.
- What gutters?

498
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,317
- On the roof.
- Where?

499
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:30,320
- On the edge. They collect water.
- What?

500
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,739
- Don't get smart!
- I don't know.

501
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,325

Come here.

503
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:45,710
- Very good. A lady of discerning taste.
- Come on!

504
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:49,380
- I told you once.
- Jackie said as long as I stay...

505
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:53,801
- Don't fucking name-drop me!
- We're gonna take a walk.

506
00:41:56,514 --> 00:42:00,058
Well, right arm's still good. No?

507
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:01,935
You think that's funny?

508
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,562
Sorry.

509
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:11,694
- Tell me what happened.
- I did like you said. I stayed outside.

510
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:14,906
You must've disrespected them
or something.

511
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:17,575
I didn't do fuck!

512
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:20,995
Did you mention
that I sat down with Chris?

513
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:24,082
They didn't give a shit.

514
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:26,918
I don't think they like you.

515
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,630
I gotta pee.

516
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:34,551
Can you give me the thing?

517
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:40,807
Get the nurse to help you.
That's what they get paid for.

518
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:44,936
Maybe she'll be fine
and give you a cheap thrill.

520
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:57,574
Hello? Kelli! Hey, hon!
It's your sister. Yeah.

521
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:00,410
Now this is the most crucial part.

522
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:05,790
You put the pasta back in the pot.
You add a little gravy...

523
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,710
And a little butter.

524
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:10,587
Then...

525
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:14,132
...you put the fire back on...

526
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:19,596
...for 45 seconds, stir it up nice.
45 seconds?

527
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:25,101
Yeah. That way the macaroni absorbs
the gravy instead of just coats it.

528
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:27,687
This is for flavor.

529
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:31,899
- I need a favor.
- What?

530
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:36,237
I need a piece. I mean,
I don't need one. But...

531
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:38,156
...you know.

532
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:47,332
- Anything you wanna tell me?
- No.

It's just I think it's time I,
you know...

534
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:55,548
- What are you looking to get?
- What do you suggest?

535
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:58,843
Me, I like to know the motherfucker's
gonna work.

536
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:02,639

If you want to make a point,
go with something bigger.

540
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:17,695
It's not for intimidation.
Just in case.

541
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:21,491
Yeah, I'd go with the.38.

542
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:26,287
You can have this one.
I got another one under the bed.

with yourself, aren't you?

What do you mean?

552
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:32,186
Conceited?

553
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:35,565
Self-centered.

554
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:40,403
"Okay." I mean there's a bunch
of alternates you could've said.

555
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:46,075
You deprive yourself of nothing.

It's heavy. Is it loaded?

564

Nothing more useless
than an unloaded gun.

we're buying a service.

If it's their opinion that he
shouldn't get treated too harshly...

You gotta listen
to the experts, right?

What else is going on,
how was the rest of your week?

572
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:07,758
To be honest? Very good.

573
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:11,345
- Why is that?
- Well, that's how life is, I guess.

Sometimes good. Sometimes bad.
Things come, things go.

- She was moody, now she's herself.

- Yeah.

- Went to the zoo.
- The zoo?

You know, sometimes you gotta get
away, stop and smell the gorilla shit.

581

Good to be in nature.

582
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,636
- And the zoo made you happy.
- Yeah.

like Buddhist or Taoist...

- No.
