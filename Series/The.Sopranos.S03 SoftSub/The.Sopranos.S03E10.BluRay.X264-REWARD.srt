00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:13,637
(SOPRANOS THEME SONG)

2
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:43,977
I'm in Asbury.

3
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:46,772
I'll be at your
boatyard in 15 minutes.

4
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,734
No, I got a meeting,
I'll come there after.

5
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,687
O.J. Simpson's acquittal
they still cannot accept,

6
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,730
and now they're suing him
in civil court.

7
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,607
Simpson's attorney is outraged,

8
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,526
Fred Goldman is philosophical.

9
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,445
In Jersey, they'd have
fried his worthless ass.

10
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,823
Well, he's shunned
on his golf course now.

11
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:39,950
Oh!

12
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:42,286
There he is,
F. Lee Fatfuck.

13
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:44,872
Hold my briefs.

14
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,165
What's the matter with you?

15
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:50,085
My back, fuckin' ValueJet,
trying to save 50 bucks.

16
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,628
- How was Boca?
- How do you think?

17
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:54,131
Your uncle's quaking
in his boots I was there to pop him.

18
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:57,301
Ho, wait till
we get outside, huh?

19
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:58,468
Junior's looking for a way out.

20
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:00,345
But, he's got that
iron rod up his ass.

21
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:03,724
He thought he was
in line to be boss.

22
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,142
Now he's gotta take orders
from somebody

23
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,685
who used to fetch him
his Sambuca.

24
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,896
Hey, fuck him.

25
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:10,397
Is he gonna sit down or not?

26
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,858
If Tony will guarantee
his safety.

27
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,527
You deal with it, alright, Tony?

28
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:19,406
Make it Christmas,

29
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:21,575
this way I don't have to
go on that fuckin' cruise.

30
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,452
No sooner do I
get back from Florida

31
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,747
than Ange has booked a suite
on the Dawn Princess.

32
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,790
5,000 bucks a week
and no way off.

33
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,417
Thank God Carm gets seasick.

34
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:33,503
We're staying home this year
so Jackie can study for his SATs.

35
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:35,255
Ro found him a great tutor.

36
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:36,673
Pray he goes to a state school.

37
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,675
You oughta see Terri's
bills from Villanova.

38
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:40,427
And Matt and Kevin
right behind her...

39
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:43,639
Hey, Sal, you need money, you come
to me, you hear what I'm sayin'?

40
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,849
Don't be moving that "h"
no more, Puss.

41
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,517
It's too risky.

42
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,317
I always wanted
a house by the ocean.

43
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,236
Maybe in another life.

44
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,368
Ton'! Tony?

45
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,372
Hey, Paulie.

46
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:09,998
We gonna go see your boat?

47
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,835
Nah, I'm just...

48
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,797
...thinking about
our former friend.

49
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,090
Who?

50
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,595
Him?

51
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:24,763
Not me,

52
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,556
never.

53
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,352
Me and Jackie met him
down here in '95,

54
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,687
when he got back from Boca.

55
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:33,772
Oh, yeah, that crazy
shit with your uncle.

56
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,649
Junior hijacked Jackie's truck.

57
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:36,942
What about it?

58
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,819
I should've seen it
then, that's all.

59
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,571
Don't waste another second
on that rat fuck, Ton'.

60
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:43,699
I'd kill him again if I could.

61
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,287
Tommy Angeletti,

62
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,872
he's doing a re-bar
at the Esplanade.

63
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,291
Yeah?

64
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,877
He's into me for 100 large
on college basketball.

65
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,922
Now Ralphie's holding up
the contractor for more money.

66
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,383
He's got the site
shutdown on a strike.

67
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,552
Angeletti can't work.

68
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,097
Paulie, your fuckin' book

69
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,349
against millions gonna
roll in off the Esplanade?

70
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,184
I figured you'd take his side.

71
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:12,394
But, Ralphie
shouldn't come across

72
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:15,147
with a couple of
no-show electrician jobs?

73
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,482
I shouldn't get something
outta this fuckin' esplanade?

74
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,863
Alright, I'll talk to him.

75
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:56,063
(WHEEZING)

76
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,370
Oh, good, you're up.

77
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,038
I just got the digital
video for Meadow.

78
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,165
It's three down, three to go.

79
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,250
Plus, the scooter is ready,
but you're gonna have to pick it up.

80
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:18,627
It's on my list.

81
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,212
You're not gonna like this
next bit of news, either.

82
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,964
Janice is insisting on cooking
Christmas dinner this year.

83
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:24,966
Christmas Eve or Christmas Day?

84
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,176
I'm doing Christmas Eve.

85
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,803
You wanna turn her
loose on shellfish?

86
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,013
She's determined to cook
goose on Christmas Day.

87
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,765
Why?

88
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,767
Well, her impulses are right,
she's over here all the time.

89
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:36,144
She volunteered me to make
the gravy and the lasagna,

90
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:37,771
so, with everything else
I gotta do today,

91
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,606
I gotta bring half
my kitchen over there,

92
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,733
and she needs you because
the fuse box is on the fritz again.

93
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,777
Oh, fuck, come on, I'm busy.

94
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,195
What, I'm not?!

95
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,995
Well, I was feeling good,

96
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,415
all of a sudden,
I'm back to square one.

97
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,791
What do you mean?

98
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,294
I had another one of
those attacks this morning.

99
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,133
Not the whole thing,

100
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,553
but, it was right there,

101
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,762
under the surface,

102
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,807
that feeling like I got
ginger ale in my brain.

103
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,559
Are you taking your medication?

104
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,646
Not every day.

105
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,356
Is that what
the prescription says?

106
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,650
Another thing to feel bad about.

107
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,402
Well?

108
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:27,988
Can you tell me
what led up to this?

109
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,364
You know my log,

110
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,867
I was supposed to write
everything down for you?

111
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,536
Look, it's just a list of shit
I gotta do for Christmas.

112
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,788
All the pressure
we put on ourselves

113
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,541
this time of the year.

114
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:43,462
I call it "Stressmas".

115
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,963
That's cute.

116
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,176
I was looking forward
to Christmas this year.

117
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:51,011
No shit.

118
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,138
Now, here I go, right back
in the fuckin' rabbit hole.

119
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,977
Okay, let's do the drill.

120
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,812
The attack, what preceded it?

121
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,189
Yesterday I went
down to the shore

122
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:04,357
to get my boat winterized.

123
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:05,984
What happened?

124
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:10,739
I started thinking
about this thing

125
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,282
that happened years ago.

126
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,993
I haven't thought about it
since it happened.

127
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,369
Tell me about it.

128
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,040
I can't.

129
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,500
I see.

130
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,044
We're at one of
our favorite junctures.

131
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,009
Without going into specifics...

132
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,642
I can tell you it was
a friend of mine.

133
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:42,604
I found out he was working
for the federal government.

134
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:48,985
Enough said?

135
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,612
I see.

136
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:54,908
Am I ruining your Christmas?

137
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,497
# Be accepted #

138
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:02,707
A-major?

139
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,751
# By the lord #

140
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:05,961
E-major.

141
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:09,172
# Rejected and abandoned #

142
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,674
I don't know.

143
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,133
Do you think it's too down?

144
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,510
I mean, with the chorus,

145
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,512
"His blood cleans every stain"?

146
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,847
Oh, it's a great
mother-jumping lyric, Jan.

147
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,642
What are we sellin', Ajax?

148
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,310
"His blood cleans stains"?

149
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:23,979
(KNOCKING)

150
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,647
My brother, I hope.

151
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,108
Shit, fuck.

152
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,195
Hey, you guys, come on in.

153
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,530
We're just working.

154
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:34,698
On the fuse box?

155
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,199
No, we're making a demo,

156
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,535
tryin' to get some
major label interest here.

157
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,456
God, the poor thing.

158
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,176
I'm not coming to eat here

159
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,053
unless this pig sty
is cleaned up!

160
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,097
It's my wrist, Tony.

161
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:03,310
And the Percodans
aren't even working anymore.

162
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:04,853
You got any rubber gloves?

163
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,479
I'll get started,

164
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,815
and we can work on the stock.

165
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:15,780
Whoa, your wrist,

166
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,907
I thought the doctor said
it was just a sprain.

167
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,993
Apparently, there's
nerve involvement.

168
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,537
I may need an operation.

169
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,254
From the Russian?

170
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,423
It was the worst
night of my life,

171
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,760
but, it led me to Jesus.

172
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,553
Come on, Janice,
when's the last time

173
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:41,514
you went to a prayer meetin'?

174
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,351
I know.

175
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:46,936
And, Aaron and I don't
even sleep together anymore,

176
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,980
but in a larger sense,

177
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:52,108
Christianity's brought
about a business, with this CCM.

178
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:53,610
The what?

179
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,821
Christian contemporary, Tony,
ohh!

00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:53,858
How you doin', 'Mainy?

359
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,610
Fine, Tony-oni.

360
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:59,322
Listen...

361
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,033
I thought you'd wanna know.

362
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,785
Two guys over there,
at that table...

363
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:05,953
Yeah?

364
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:07,496
I think they're FBI.

365
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,960
(LAUGHING)
I'm kidding.

366
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:16,005
I'm kidding, enjoy.

367
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,473
He's ready.

368
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,523
You are a hypocrite.

369
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,150
That's what you are.

370
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,194
You vilify a man
behind his back,

371
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,363
and then you smile in his face.

372
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,783
Something's gotta keep
the customers coming back

373
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:47,703
and it's not gonna be your
mooshata raviolis, lately.

374
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,628
Hey.

375
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,463
Charmaine...

376
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,507
Sometimes we're forced
to work the same shift.

377
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,385
Your wife, her ass
may be improved Artie, but...

378
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:04,220
Hey, hey, hey, come on, Sil.

379
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,310
She's over here
joking about the FBI.

380
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,062
Since when is that funny?

381
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,274
(PHONE RINGING)

382
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,359
Yeah.

383
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:23,114
No, wait, hold on a minute.

384
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,950
Go ahead.

385
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,583
Alright, great.

386
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,502
Yeah...

387
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,755
Merry Christmas to you, too.

388
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,218
Mr. Valdez?

389
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,636
That's me.

390
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,641
(LAUGHING)

391
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,107
I know you.

392
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,151
You look like maybe someone,
I don't know...

393
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,236
He's the designata drive.

394
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:03,404
Me?

395
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,573
(MOCKING)
no, you the designata drive.

396
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,783
No, no, you, you, it's you.

397
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,493
- You!
- No.

398
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,871
Airport Ramada, right?

399
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,080
Yeah.

400
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,248
Yeah, let's go, c'mon.

401
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,429
How was dinner?

402
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:29,597
Good.

403
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,017
Was Charmaine there?

404
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,435
Yep.

405
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,854
She looks good, doesn't she?

406
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,773
What, are you disappointed?

407
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,443
Her husband dumped her, you thought
she was gonna look like a krull?

408
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,236
A krull?

409
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:47,656
A crone, a troll, I don't know.

410
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,079
Holiday traffic.

411
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:56,040
My head is clanging like a bell.

412
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,625
I got the scooter.

413
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,224
Yay!!

414
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,433
Hello Bedford Falls!

415
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:15,643
Oh, Jesus.

416
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,228
Merry Christmas!

417
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,105
Enough already.

418
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:21,232
Merry Christmas, George.

419
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,151
Santa, we still haven't got one.

420
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,486
You wanna do it?

421
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,530
Me, what do I know about it?

422
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:29,115
I don't have kids.

423
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:31,325
You don't have to,
Santa doesn't have any kids.

424
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:32,910
Yeah, that's strange,

425
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,830
that Mr. and Mrs. Claus
didn't have kids of their own.

426
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:38,082
Probably why they got
into it in the first place.

427
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,583
I used to think
the elves were their kids.

428
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,502
They were running
a sweatshop over there.

429
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,045
There was something on TV,

430
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:44,380
the original elves were ugly,

431
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,882
traveled with Santa
to throw bad kids a beatin',

432
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,759
and he gave the good ones toys.

433
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,220
The fuckin' Grinch.

434
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,056
Maybe that's where
they got the idea.

435
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:56,267
And fuckin' Dr. Seuss
ripped it off.

436
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:59,145
That Grinch, man,
that's where the money is.

437
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:00,354
A couple hundred mil.

438
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:02,398
Put Jim Carrey
in the motherfucker.

439
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:03,732
Tony...

440
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,276
Hey!

441
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,153
I got stuff for the party, toys.

442
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,320
From me and junior.

443
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,574
They're not wrapped, but this way
they can see what they're getting.

444
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,701
Tell junior thank you.

445
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,127
What?

446
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,420
Ho-fuckin'-ho.

447
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,213
You're right.

448
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:27,923
What are you talking about?

449
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:29,925
You wanna play Santa Claus
at the party this year?

450
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:31,552
No, I can't do that.

451
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,720
Why not?

452
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:35,681
I don't know, I don't know how.

453
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,476
What's to know? You ask 'em
what they want for Christmas,

454
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,020
you give 'em a nice toy,
and that's the end of it.

455
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:43,272
- No, not me, I can't.
- Yes, you can.

456
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,982
- I can't!
- Why not?

457
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,817
I'm shy.

458
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:53,866
The boss of this family told you

459
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,493
you're gonna be Santa Claus,

460
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,702
you're Santa Claus.

461
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,662
So, shut the fuck up about it.

A strange and macabre
Christmas story,

463
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:13,928
another sad incidence
of continuing violence

464
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:15,638
against livery drivers.

465
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:17,848
In downtown Newark, police
were called to the scene

466
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,893
of what appeared to be
a Christmas prank gone awry.

467
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,145
Livery driver Igor Parnasky

468
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:25,731
was found trapped
under Santa's sleigh,

469
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:28,317
and severely beaten
inside the window display

470
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:29,985
at Curran's sporting goods.

471
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:31,570
The Russian emigre also suffered

472
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:33,614
injuries from broken glass.

473
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,533
From his description
of his assailants,

474
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,784
police are questioning members

475
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,410

Yeah?

483
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,517
I think I know what's
missing from the song.

484
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:03,143
It's the brother concept.

485
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:04,311
He ain't heavy?

486
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:06,021
No, I mean, not exactly.

487
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:10,734
Maybe we can try
to get something down.

488
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,570
Jan, you're crying.

489
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,782

don't see our loved ones.

00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:27,459
Hi, whatcha doing?

492
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,047
Just enjoying the tree.

493
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:34,592
I love this time of year.

Me, too.

So, where's Jackie tonight?

498
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:59,074
He had to go visit a friend
of his in the hospital.

499

Oh, no, who?

500

they think it's appendicitis.

Oh, my God.

502
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,960
So, you and Jackie
are getting pretty close, huh?

looks really great.

give you a compliment.

539
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,960
Hey, what's goin' on?

540
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:16,170
Gettin' a little lovin'?

541
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:21,091
It's not what you think.

542
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,593
C'mon.

543
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,096
C'mon, it's alright,
I just wanna talk to you.

544
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,681
C'mon.

545
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:31,143
It's a bachelor party,
my frat brothers.

546
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:34,396
I didn't do anything!

547
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:35,564
Shut up!

548
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:39,860
Put your hands up,
put your hands up!

549
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,028
No... please.

550
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,614
C'mon, you fuck!

551
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:47,326
You fuckin' pussy piece of shit.

552
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:49,578
All I did was tell your old man
what a good kid you were,

553
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,246
and all you do
is fuckin' hurt me.

554
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:53,040
I'm sorry!

555
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,459
I'm sorry.

556
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:58,879
I'm sorry.

557
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,840
What's this?

558
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,343
Hmm?

559
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,179
Nice.

560
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,515
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

561
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,435
You bottomed out.

562
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:15,521
What do you mean?

563
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:24,196
You bottomed out.

564
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,920
I wish I could get up
at 11:30 every morning

565
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,881
after being out all night,
God knows where.

566
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:45,592
(POTS AND PANS BANGING)

567
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:48,345
Stop with the pots and pans.

568
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:49,888
Where were you last night?

569
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:52,224
Nowhere, I wasn't anywhere.

570
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,726
I was the monogamy
poster boy, swear to God.

571
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:56,395
Oh, please.

572
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:01,650
Well, I break up with
the so-called Russian whore,

573
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,277
I'm towing the line,

574
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:04,695
and this is the thanks I get!

575
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,030
What about Charmaine?

576
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,574
Charmaine?

577
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:10,200
Mm-hmm, I know all about you.

578
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:11,368
What?

579
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,245
I didn't do anything.

580
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:14,580
Yeah, you did in high school.

581
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:16,290
High school?

582
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:18,166
Don't try to deny it.

583
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:20,544
Oh, okay, high school, okay.

584
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,963
Her husband dumps her and
she never looked so good?

585
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,965
You gotta ask yourself why.

586
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:28,135
I didn't do nothing.

587
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,469
I didn't do nothing!

588
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:32,097
It's too late. I don't believe
anything you say.

589
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:42,399
My wife had her doubts
about Jackie Jr...

590
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:46,862
and all along I kept defending
the little two-faced prick.

591
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:49,698
Do you feel responsible
for their relationship?

592
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:54,286
Meadow thinks she'd still be
going out with the Oreo cookie

593
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:55,954
if it wasn't for me.

594
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:58,290
Well, that's true, isn't it?

595
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,835
The question is, what am I
gonna do about Jackie?

596
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,046
Should I tell my wife?

597
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:06,256
Meadow, Jesus, she's...

598
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:09,843
It'd break her heart
if she knew.

599
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,730
On another subject,

600
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:24,483
I was thinking about
what we were talking about

601
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,318
last time you were here.

602
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:30,739
You know, your friend who was working
for the federal government?

603
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,908
Granted I get
most of my information

604
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:35,035
from the movies and Bill Curtis.

605
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:38,246
But I was thinking...

606
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,677
They're around
the block out there.

607
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,887
Biggest one yet.

608
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,305
Where's the friggin' beard?

609
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:56,974
I saw it in the box.

610
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,059
It's gotta be there.

611
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,686
Even without padding,

612
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:02,896
the suit's too small
on this fatso.

613
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,485
Motherfucker.

614
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:11,446
What, Ton'?

615
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:13,156
He was wearing a wire...

616
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:16,827
when he came to the party

617
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:20,247
he already had the suit on.

618
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,083
Alvin!

619
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,292
Okay!

620
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:28,922
# Christmas,
Christmastime is here #

621
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:31,466
Hey, look at this.

622
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:33,927
Oh...!

623
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,220
You been walking around
like that?

624
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:38,098
Boosting salvation army
kettles now.

625
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:39,766
Kevin, go make me a sandwich.

626
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:40,934
Okay, dad.

627
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,310
He's a method actor.

628
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:43,520
Getting into character like Al.

629
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,313
Yeah...

630
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:47,649
"It was you, Fredo."

631
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:50,360
Look at that,
don't even need a pillow.

632
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,362
Hey!
Watch the suit!

633
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:55,365
He can't make a joke?

634
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,367
What, are you
Mr. Sensitive over here?

635
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,828
Chrissy, ashtrays.

636
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:10,172
Tony...

637
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:12,632
...this problem

638
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,177
with the red-tag garbage dumping
in Paden City...

639
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:16,428
Fuckin' Christmas,

640
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,346
he wants to
talk about medical waste?

641
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:21,558
I just want to double-check that the
way is paved for us to go down there,

642
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,769
we reached out to EPA guy
like we told Barone.

643
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:25,979
That reminds me, Tony,
Dick called this morning.

644
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,939
I'm fuckin' talkin' and
stop fuckin' interruptin'!

645
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:31,026
- The fuck is wrong with you?!
- Fuck you!

646
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:33,153
Hey, hey, hey!

647
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,738
Take it easy! Ton'.

648
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,656
- What's the matter with you?!
- The fuck with you.

649
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:40,535
Jesus Christ.

650
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:43,455
Oh, it's as cold as
your sister's tit out there.

651
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:44,915
You should see the crowd
of little people.

652
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,375
Jackie Jr.,
how you doin', huh?

653
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:48,835
You look great.

654
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:51,505
Hey, Jackie, tell 'em what you told
me in the car on the way over here.

655
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:53,590
Come on, the capital of Canada.

656
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,383
The kid's got it up here.

657
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,845
Give me your coat, c'mon.

658
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:01,306
Crissy, let 'em in
for chrissake.

659
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,476
One, two, three, four,

660
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:06,853
open up the stupid door!

661
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:08,438
(KIDS CHEERING)

662
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,150
Go see Santa,

663
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:14,111
right this way.

664
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,695
Ho, ho, ho!

665
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:18,406
Merry Christmas,
come on in, children!

666
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:20,534
Don't be afraid,
c'mon, sweetheart.

667
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:21,952
Come sit on Santa's lap.

668
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,287
Oh...!

669
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:27,541
Have you been a good girl?
What do you want for Christmas?

670
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:29,543
I want a new doll and a kitchen.

671
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,711
You want a new doll
and a kitchen.

672
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:32,879
Here's something, Dad.

673
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:34,464
I mean, Santa.

674
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:37,217
My little elf here's
got a little snow on the brain.

675
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:38,385
He called me Dad.

676
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,637
You like it?
Big enough to be your sister.

677
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,013
Merry Christmas.

678
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:43,181
Thank you, Santa.

679
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:44,558
Oh, how cute.

680
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:45,934
Who's next?

681
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:48,770
C'mon, don't be shy, ho, ho, ho!

682
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:52,274
Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.

683
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:55,068
Next in line, we got
a lotta people to go, c'mon.

684
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:57,404
What do you want?

685
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,281
Merry Christmas.

686
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:00,448
Wait a minute.

687
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:01,741
I gotta give you
a present, here.

688
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:03,994
C'mon, single file over here!

689
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,245
C'mon, next one in line!

690
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:08,415
It would kill him to say
"Ho, ho, ho"?

691
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:09,583
You were just here.

692
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:10,750
I was not.

693
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:12,878
Yeah, you were, you were
on my lap five minutes ago.

694
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:15,046
- No, I wasn't.
- Yes, you were.

695
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:17,465
Now you're going on Santa's list
and you're getting nothing!

696
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:18,842
Fuck you, Santa!

697
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,886
Hey!
Hey!

698
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:22,971
Gregorio!

699
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,639
How dare you talk
that way to Santa.

700
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:26,600
He never talks that way at home.

701
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:29,477
My friend, you don't talk
that way to Santa.

702
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:32,063
Get back there,
tell Santa you're sorry.

703
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:33,648
Go on.

704
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,652
I'm sorry, Santa.

705
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,862
That's better.

706
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,452
I don't care, you are punished.

707
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,872
What the hell's
wrong with you, Bobby?

708
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,123
You got kids of your own.

709
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:51,458
I didn't wanna do this.

710
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:52,626
Shyness is a curse.

711
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:54,920
Why don't you lighten up
a little bit? It's Christmas.

712
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:58,924
C'mere, honey.

713
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:00,759
Don't be scared of Santa.

714
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,219
C'mon, there you go.

715
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:05,931
Next year he goes
to Santa school.

716
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:07,849
Fuckin' ho hum, if you ask me.

717
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:10,185
I don't miss Pussy's
fake fuckin' good cheer,

718
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:11,353
tell you the truth.

719
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,313
Let him stay with the fish.

720
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,984
Why'd you go to
that psychic last year?

721
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,986
Since you don't
dwell on this shit.

722
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:21,738
That was different.

723
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,865
Chrissy was shot.

724
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,283
That was a paranormal event.

725
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,745
What the fuck
are you talking about?

726
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,498
That psychic told you those guys were
haunting you. The guys that you...

727
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:36,920
Pussy, I loved that cocksucker
like a brother

728
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,380
and he fucked me in the ass.

729
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:43,551
That's the difference
between Puss and the others.

730
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:44,719
Him you loved.

731
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:47,430
The world don't run on love.

732
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,266
He was a rat bastard.

733
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,393
One thing you got to admit,

734
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,186
he made a great Santa Claus.

735
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:55,355
He did.

736
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,732
In the end, fuck Santa Claus.

737
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:08,535
Another sweater.

738
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:09,869
That's from Nana.

739
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:12,247
(DOORBELL)
You'll tell her how much you like it.

740
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,542
Who could that be so early?

741
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,127
Let me see, maybe it'll fit me.

742
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,587
It's not bad,
better than last year.

743
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:22,340
Jackie Jr., hi.

744
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:23,883
Merry Christmas.

745
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:26,177
Merry Christmas, Aunt Carm.

746
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:28,263
It's okay if I come in?

747
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:31,016
We're just opening our presents.

748
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:42,319
Merry Christmas, Ton'.

749
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,695
Good morning.

750
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,530
Merry Christmas.

751
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:46,990
Merry Christmas.

752
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:49,868
These are from Mom
for everybody.

753
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,456
This is for you.

754
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:56,374
Wow, thank you.

755
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:57,876
Let me get your present.

756
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,836
No, you can open
yours first if you want.

757
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,379
Okay.

758
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,726
This is so beautiful, Jackie,

759
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,269
thank you.

760
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,438
There's something on the back.

761
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:22,984
"To M.S. from J.A.

762
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:25,070
I will
always be true."

763
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,238
Oh, Jackie.

764
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,543
I'll be right back.

765
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,213
C'mere, let me see that.

766
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:53,181
Can I talk to you?

767
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:02,607
I flunked out of Rutgers.

768
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:07,237
I'm sorry, I know I fucked up.

769
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:10,698
I got distracted this year
by things.

770
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,745
Ralph said I was probably
wasting my time

771
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,123
- if I didn't have the aptitude.
- Ralph?

772
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:20,875
You know, he didn't
go to school,

773
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:23,169
and look at the money he was
making when he was my age.

774
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:24,921
And the piece,

775
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,924
my car got broken into a couple
of times at the frat house,

776
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,134
so Ralph gave it to me.

777
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,555
It was fuckin' stupid,
I know it.

778
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:35,974
But Tony, I'm gonna
be alright now.

779
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:38,643
I'm gonna design men's suits.

780
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:41,187
Meadow thinks I should
go to the Fashion Institute.

781
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:43,606
I really think I could be good
if I applied myself.

782
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:46,985
You bullshit me
and you betray my daughter.

783
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:51,865
I'm sorry.

784
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:53,867
I'm sorry.

785
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,703
Go back inside.

786
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:00,999
I'm gonna be frank on this.

787
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:03,626
I haven't decided
what to do with you.

788
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:16,514
Comin' through!

789
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:20,518
You can't stay?

790
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:22,729
I still have to
give you your present.

791
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,523
I'm driving Mom up
to the home to see Grandma.

792
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,906
Thank you for
my beautiful necklace.

793
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,668
Merry Christmas.

794
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:52,175
Merry Christmas.

795
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:55,261
Go be with your family
and open your presents.

796
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:56,596
Love you.

797
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:09,526
Oh, my God.

798
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:10,735
Lemme see, Mom.

799
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:11,903
Look at this.

800
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:13,154
Wow.

801
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:14,364
Wow.

802
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,449
Mmm.

803
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:18,284
Well, uh,

804
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:21,913
this is gonna seem
really stupid after that,

805
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:25,083
but it's your turn, Dad.

806
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:26,709
This is for you.

807
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:32,924
I didn't think you were
gonna get me anything.

808
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:34,092
After...

809
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,260
It's Christmas.

810
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:41,808
Thank you.

811
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:44,060
Come on, open it.

812
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:45,645
What is it?

813
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:47,772
Who knows.

814
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,570
"Big Mouth Billy Bass",
what is that?

815
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:55,488
Oh, those are good.

816
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,740
Wait till you see what it does.

817
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,033
What does it do?

818
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:00,451
You'll see.

819
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:02,870
I know I give you
a lot of stuff, Dad,

820
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:04,497
I don't know
what you do with it,

821
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:05,999
but,

822
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:10,128
I want to see this
on your desk, promise?

823
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:11,838
Yeah.

824
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:17,302
(MUSIC PLAYING)

825
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:22,557
Oh my God. That is hilarious.

826
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,851
# I'd love
to stay... #

827
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:26,477
Wait, mom.

828
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:29,606
# But, take me to the river #

829
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:33,693
# Drop me in the water #

830
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,028
What a riot.

831
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:38,072
# Take me to the river #

832
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,616
It's cute.

833
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:41,367
Thanks, honey.

834
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:45,330
# Take me to the river #

835
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:51,586
# Jesus told me #

836
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:54,756
# Everything is
gonna be alright #

837
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:59,552
# Oh, Jesus told me #

838
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:03,097
# Everything
is gonna be alright #

839
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:06,809
# Jesus told me #

840
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:10,188
# Everything
is gonna be alright #

841
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:13,858
# Be alright, oh, be alright #

842
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:17,362
# Be alright... #

843
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:21,741
# Be alright, be alright #

844
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:25,703
# Gonna be alright,
gonna be alright #

845
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:27,413

# Everything
is gonna be alright #

847
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,254
# Oh, be alright #

848
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:37,131
# Yes, it is #

849
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:39,342
# Be alright #

850
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:43,930
# I know for myself,
it's gonna be alright #

851
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:45,348
# Be alright #

852
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:49,602
# Yeah, everything's
gonna be alright #

853
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:52,563
# Be alright #

854
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:56,359
# I have no doubt
it'll be alright #

855
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:59,862
# In my mind I know it is #

856
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,948
# It's gonna be alright #

857
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:03,866
# Be alright #

# Everything #
