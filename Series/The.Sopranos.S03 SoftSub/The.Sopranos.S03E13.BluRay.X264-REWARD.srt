is that it happen in a timely fashion.

No! Your pawn can only move
two spaces on the first move.

- I got an alarm guy I pay.

I tip Ralphie's guys about the safe.
Gave them the codes.

172
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,514
All right. Answer the fucking phone.

173
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:39,103
Hello? Yeah.

174
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:42,607
Carmela.

175
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,318
Sounds like she's crying.

176
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,957
Yeah?

177
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,792
What?!

178
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,296
A permanent expulsion.
I prayed I would never see this.

179
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:09,133
Even I got through school
without getting expelled.

180
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:13,346
- Maybe it's a blessing.
- I don't see how.

181
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:16,975
- The place was too easy.
- What? I got expelled.

182
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:20,395
You got nothing to say
unless I ask a question!

183
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:21,854
Tony.

184
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:28,528
I work hard all day to pay for this
house, big-screen TVs, food...

185
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:34,075
...video games, all kinds of scooters
and bicycles, Columbia University...

186
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:37,412
...and for what?
To come home to this?!

187
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,330
Sucks to be you.

188
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:43,918
My God, Tony!

189
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,840
There's more where that came from!

190
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,759
The counselor said it
was a cry for help.

191
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,011
Come on!

192
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:57,890
She recommended a school.
They have a psychologist on staff.

193
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:02,186
- No. He's going to military school.
- What?

194
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:05,356
- I got brochures.
- You got school brochures?

195
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:09,610
From Janice. She was gonna
send Harpo, but it was too late!

196
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:14,198
- I'm not sending him away.
- We're looking at those brochures!

197
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:17,035
What is with you, Tony?

198
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:23,750
Now, this I like:
"Highly-structured environment."

199
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,877
Which one is that?

200
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:33,551
H.M.I. Hudson Military Institute.
"Our Second Century of Excellence."

201
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,554
- I never said I'd go.
- We're just looking.

202
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:40,058
We're looking, and then you're going.

203
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:43,811
(PHONE RINGING)

204
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,149
- Here.
- Hello?

205
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,734
Yes?

206
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,986
Oh, hi, Marie.

207
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,113
No.

208
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:58,076
Oh, my God.

209
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,916
- Where's Rosalie?
- She's right here.

210
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,169
- She can't come to the phone.
- I'll come as soon as I can.

211
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:09,128
(WHEEPING)

212
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,424
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

213
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:18,805
Jackie Jr. was shot to death. At the
Boonton projects. By drug dealers.

214
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,100
I'm going over to Rosalie's.

215
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,946
You see?

216
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,579
(PHONE RINGING)

217
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,626
- Taco Bell.
- Hi.

218
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,796
- Hey.
- There's something I gotta tell you.

219
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,298
- I heard.
- How?

220
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:57,718
Like Mom's not gonna tell me
you got expelled?

221
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,470
Not that.

222
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:03,808
- I heard you copped to everything.
- They had my DNA.

223
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:07,061
Moron. It takes six weeks
to get DNA tests.

224
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,479
Shit.

225
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,816
- I gotta go.
- I didn't tell you yet.

226
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,401
- What?
- Jackie.

227
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:17,488
He was doing a deal
with some black dudes. They shot him.

228
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,324
He's, like, dead.

229
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:33,337
22 years old,
living in a housing project.

230
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,591
Imagine the shame for the family.

231
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:46,058
Fortunately, they were no longer
boyfriend and girlfriend.

232
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,353
- How's your daughter taking it?
- Not well.

233
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:54,525
You certainly saw it coming
with this boy, didn't you?

234
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,405
In the end, I failed him.

235
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:03,701
What the fuck you gonna do?
World today...

236
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:10,208
One thing. I won't make
the same mistake with A.J.

237
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:14,295
He got expelled.
Him we're sending to military school.

238
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:18,549
We never discussed exactly
what you want for your children.

239
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,552
I don't want their faces blown off.

240
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,263
You went into your father's business.

241
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,390
I didn't have a choice.

242
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,477
I try to give my kids
every opportunity.

243
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:33,231
Meadow's going to Columbia,
for chrissakes.

244
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:37,401
Wants to be some kind
of a professional woman.

245
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,404
- Like you.
- A psychiatrist?

246
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:44,033
And have to listen to guys like me
whine all day?

247
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:48,913
She mentioned being
a pediatrician once.

248
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,917
- You'd like that?
- I would like something like that.

249
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,671
But the important thing
is she get far away from me.

250
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,093
I mean, she could live close.

251
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,637
I think I understand.

252
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:07,556
- And your son?
- A.J?

253
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:12,353
In my business? Forget it.

254
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,773
He'd never make it.

255
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:24,282
Your father and I have to drive A.J.
up to Hudson Institute.

256
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,951
I'd feel much better if you were up.

257
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:31,330
Jackie's dead, and you perseverate
on secondary schools?

258
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,795
I was up half the night with Ro.

259
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:43,175
This morning her sister and I made
all the funeral arrangements.

260
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,469
A.J. doesn't have a school.

261
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:50,641
He can't chat all day on the Web
with the other dropouts and flakes.

262
00:21:55,105 --> 00:22:01,485
You know, he's the first person
my own age that I knew that ever died.

263
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,701
Well, he knew all the risks involved.

264
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,828
What, the X?

265
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:15,416
Half the kids I know take it.
They get it from someone.

266
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:19,253
- It's not a thing you get killed over.
- Except he did.

267
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:21,505
- Or not.
- Meaning?

268
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,426
Look at who he grew up with.

269
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:29,180
Look at who his father was.
Look at everyone we know.

270
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:34,393
- Let's not get cute.
- When I'm being cute, I'll tell you.

271
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:44,570
You liked Jackie, so you won't
believe it was his fault.

272
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:49,700
So, like others, you look for bogeymen
with Italian names to blame.

273
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:54,955
So whatever you're thinking, stop,
because that is not what happened.

274
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:10,054
- Stealing an exam is a personal defeat.
- It was wrong.

275
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:12,598
That sounds pre-programmed.

276
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:16,310
Is that how you saw your future self?
A cheat?

277
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:19,730
- No.
- How do you explain it?

278
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:25,486
There's, like, academic pressure.
About getting into college.

279
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:27,113
They're obsessed.

280
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,492
With "like, academic pressure"?
Or academic pressure?

281
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:34,620
There's all this pressure.
My parents too.

282
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:38,624
My sister goes to Columbia
and my parents expect me to go.

283
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:42,503
That's "stinking thinking."
Like with an alcoholic.

284
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:46,424
- No one makes him drink.
- I'm not an alcoholic.

285
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:50,761
How do we do things differently
than at your former school?

286
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,305
- I don't know.
- I realize that.

287
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:55,099
I'm about to tell you.

288
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:59,019
At your school, and it's not
a bad one, you're right...

289
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:03,774
...there's too much emphasis
on what's good for you, John and Jane.

290
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:08,779
Here, the higher good is of the Corps.
As Gen. MacArthur said:

291
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:12,116
"The Corps, the Corps, the Corps."

292
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:17,538
Now, how do we achieve this
revolution in thinking on your part?

293
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:22,042
Cadet Corps has first call
0530 each day...

294
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:25,129
...march to first mess 0620...

295
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:29,216
...dorm inspection 0700,
classes 0800 to 1440.

296
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:34,513
Athletic formation 1500,
except Thursdays, which is drill.

297
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:39,894
1900 to 2100 is evening study time.
Taps, lights out 2200.

298
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:43,063
What's missing? Give up?
Television.

299
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,695
- What's "0530" mean?
- 5:30 a.m.

300
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,159
I outlined a blueprint
for self-discipline...

301
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:59,997
...that would take you through
your life, and that's your question?

302
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:08,380
Why do guys in the Army, or spies,
use that "0" thing when they tell time?

303
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,717
That'll be made abundantly clear.

304
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:15,221
For now, we have an expression:
Keep it simple.

305
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,601
Captain Delaunay?

306
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:24,939
Give Mr. Soprano the T.O.I.
while I meet his parents.

307
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:26,857
Sir, yes, sir.

308
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,796
I think Anthony could greatly
benefit from our program...

309
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:52,591
...which, as I candidly told him,
is very rigorous.

310
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,927
Do you mind?

311
00:25:56,721 --> 00:26:02,560
I'll be very frank with you. I do not
agree with this hard-nosed discipline.

312
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:05,104
The mothers seldom do.

313
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:10,776
Wait till he starts
opening doors for you.

314
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:13,988
Now, that would be a miracle.

315
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:17,157
What about creativity?
Independent thought?

316
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:21,078
I stressed heavily
notions of duty and groupthink.

317
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:26,250
But I didn't mention the Army's motto
of today: Be an Army of One.

318
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:29,753
Why be an army at all?
How about a veterinarian?

319
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,672
Isn't there enough war?

320
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:36,927
- Amputees? Horrible displaced...
- He's just gonna march a little bit.

321
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:40,598
Don't get hung up on marching.
It's part of it...

322
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:47,104
...but it's nothing compared to
the mentoring and faculty involvement.

323
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,273
Well, that sounds wonderful.

324
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:53,611
We've created too many options
for our kids. They're confused.

325
00:26:53,778 --> 00:27:00,284
When things go wrong, we fob them off
onto the substance-recovery industry.

326
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:06,624
This "army of one" thing. What happens
when each army of one decides:

327
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,501
"Fuck it, I won't go
over the foxhole"?

328
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:13,672
Or, "Let's shoot the lieutenant"?
Because they been told...

329
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,884
...you know,
"You're an army of one."

330
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,345
Audie Murphy was an army of one.

331
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:22,348
We're preparing him
for a military career?

332
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:23,849
No. No.

333
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,226
One day at a time.

334
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:31,315
- You want to train him to be a killer?
- Will you stop? They're soldiers.

335
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:36,028
- The Army hardly ever goes to war!
- They were marching with rifles!

336
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:39,823
- They're symbolic!
- Symbolic of what?

337
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,575
Respect!

338
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:46,997
He will be disciplined by kids
hardly older than himself.

339
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:50,542
Boys his age still kill frogs
and small animals.

340
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:55,214
The Cusamanos' Binky? The bomb
with nails, you think it was A.J?

341
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,841
No. That's what I am trying to say!

342
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,886
He is still a child!
He's a normal child!

343
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:04,848
He's made mistakes
and he's got a shitload to learn.

344
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,769
That doesn't mean I'll let
you send him to a school...

345
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:12,189
...that scares him
into following orders!

346
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:18,278
- He thinks the world owes him a living!
- What could have given him that idea?

347
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:24,368
We tried it your way for 15 years.
Validating his feelings.

348
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:29,540
That school did the same! He thinks
the world runs on his feelings!

349
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:35,212
- He's gonna go learn to be a man!
- I will not send him to that place!

350
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,549
Oh, no, fuck that! Allow me!

351
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:51,729
Fuck!

352
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,064
God!

353
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:00,654
T!

354
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:06,076
About the sit-down...

355
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:09,288
Jesus Christ, can I bury
my best friend's kid?

356
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:14,293
I am not ready for this.

357
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,921
Okay, let's go. We gotta do this.

358
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,757
Come here, you.

359
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:27,431
Rosalie?

360
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,976
Ro, honey? Hi, sweetheart.

361
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:39,568
Ro, I'm so sorry.

362
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:42,321
Lay some off.

363
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,996
I'm so sorry about your brother.

364
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:56,502
You remember my cousin,
Mackenzie Trucillo?

365
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:01,965
Oh, my God.

366
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:03,217
(SOBBING)

367
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:06,345
- Sweetheart, let's sit down.
- Come on, sit.

368
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,893
- It's all right.
- Sit down.

369
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,686
It's okay.

370
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,072
A point and a quarter.

371
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:29,159
Would you listen to me, Moose?
It's very simple.

372
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,666
Look at this place.

373
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,254
Two days before the Super Bowl
and nobody shows up.

374
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:41,672
That's not true.

375
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,843
You'd think I'd remember,
all my years married to Jack.

376
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:49,429
What happened, Ton?
Vegas moving the line?

377
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:51,723
Just make sure.

378
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,768
Point and a half.

379
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,161
Talk to you a minute?

380
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:18,792
Russ? Mr. Cozzarelli?
My partner and I cut this.

381
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,547
Devotional music. It's ragged,
it's a demo. Christian contemporary.

382
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:28,093
I wish I had it for my mom's funeral.
Tommy Mottola at Sony...

383
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:31,388
...looks like he's gonna
offer us a deal.

384
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:44,610
Listen, about Jackie.
And, you know, Ralph.

385
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:48,697
How you handled it,
so it wouldn't stick to any of us...

386
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:57,247
I'm only here out of respect to you.
But I'm sorry.

387
00:31:57,415 --> 00:32:02,502
And I appreciate you looking out for me.

388
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:05,464
- Oh, yeah?
- You two were close, I know...

389
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,591
No, you don't know.

390
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:14,723
Anyway, what I said,
about not loving you...

391
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:17,142
That's not how it is.

392
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,136
Let's try it your way.

393
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,478
I got here first? Cocksucker!

394
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:05,148
Sit down. Relax, have a coffee.
He'll be here.

395
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:14,157
Well, I think I got Ma situated.

396
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:18,328
- The Brother Jobe Home?
- No, fuck that. We went there.

397
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:21,665
Che puzzo, I almost gagged.

398
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,084
We're gonna go with Green Grove.

399
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:27,337
- On Tony's recommendation.
- I never did that.

400
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:30,340
You did.
When you had your ma there.

401
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:33,844
By the way, did she have
the Silver Bird package?

402
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,554
I don't know.

403
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:40,434
- It's the most expensive nursing home.
- It's a retirement community.

404
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:43,520
The level of care. Ma was crying.

405
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,856
- Eight grand a month?
- Who cares?

406
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:49,526
You see a Seeing Eye dog here?
Cup full of pencils?

407
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,737
I'm not trying to insult you...

408
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:54,406
Be tough, but I'll figure it out.

409
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:59,119
Worth every fucking penny.
I'm the hero now, boy.

410
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,204
Thank you.

411
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,711
- You're late.
- I can be on time...

412
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,047
...but you'll always be stupid.

413
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,715
Hey, hey! Sit down!

414
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:15,719
Sit the fuck down and shut up!

415
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:21,391
- You want one of those?
- No.

416
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:24,144
I was at my goomar's all night.

417
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:29,066
Ro, with the grief, poor kid.
I can't get any sleep. It's incessant.

418
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,818
So. Who wants to talk first?

419
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:34,946
What's to talk about?
I'm owed that 50 G's.

420
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:39,951
A fucking alarm code? 50 G's?
Five, tops. Maybe, as a finder's fee.

421
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,953
The heist fell in your lap.

422
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:45,957
You fuck those fat pigs
at the carpenter's union.

423
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:50,921
Three mil a year from construction,
this family sees.

424
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:54,174
All right, five's
a negotiating platform.

425
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,134
Take it easy.

426
00:34:56,302 --> 00:35:00,639
It's not five, we all know that.
His guys did the heavy lifting.

427
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:04,643
Little Paulie was good to go.
Fucking car never came.

428
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:08,939
They left him waiting outside
his house like an asshole.

429
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:18,448
Ralphie, give him 12K.

430
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:23,286
- I can't believe this.
- Why not?

431
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:27,833
- You believed a UFO was over Jersey.
- I won't tell you again!

432
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,460
T, I'm asking you to reconsider.

433
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:34,297
You requested a sit-down.
He heard you out.

434
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:37,843
But Christ, I'm leaving
$38,000 on the table.

435
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:42,139
Tony! I had to park the car
all the way over there.

436
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,686
Son of a bitch!

437
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:02,159
Miss? Where could I find
something more dressy?

438
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:06,204
- Not evening, but muted?
- I'll go look.

439
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:11,835
They have this great black
cocktail I saw over there.

440
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:15,589
Those I have.
Thing is, it's for a funeral.

441
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:20,510
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Yeah. Guy was, like, 22.

442
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,179
Car accident?

443
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:25,515
Actually, murder.
It was a cousin of mine.

444
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:30,020
Last time I went to one, my boyfriend
bitched over what I wore.

445
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:35,442
It was his boss' mother's wake.
I said, "You think Tony even noticed?"

446
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:38,361
But he keeps on about everything.

447
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:41,031
Oh, Madonna. Jesus...

448
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:46,203
Me, too. I love Blahniks,
but they were killing me last night.

449
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,956
I was gonna go to Starbucks.

450
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:52,125
- So was I!
- Wanna go together?

451
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,252
- Yeah.
- Great.

452
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:58,131
- Blahniks are slim-line.
- I was dancing, my God!

453
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:01,218
- I'll tell you, Jimmy Choos...
- Worse.

454
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:05,013
- My name's Danielle.
- Adriana. Do you live in Nutley?

455
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:09,434
If you're one of many
who suffer from erectile dysfunction...

456
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:12,103
...you know it's no laughing matter.

457
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:13,897
Hey, I know this guy!

458
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:17,943
Treatment is covered
by most medical plans.

459
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:21,947
I'm Dr. Ira Freid,
of the Freid Medical Group.

460
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:24,574
Be it Viagra, penile enhancement...

461
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:28,328
Imagine?
Needing an operation like that?

462
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:34,668
I can increase the length, girth and
vitality of what occurred naturally.

463
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:39,464
My associates and I have offices
throughout the Tri-State area.

464
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:42,133
Our discretion is assured.

465
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:43,134
Ohhh.

466
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:45,595
- Sergeant Bilko!
- Tony.

467
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:49,849
You're right. I'm sorry.
But we shouldn't get too gloomy.

468
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:54,646
My God, your dress grays.
You know what? You look very handsome.

469
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:57,148
- She's right, you do.
- Yeah, right.

470
00:37:57,441 --> 00:38:02,112
No, I'm serious. Tight suit like that,
it shows off your lats.

471
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,656
- Put on the hat.
- No way.

472
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:08,034
Please? He looked cute
at the uniform company.

473
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,786
You won't sew the hat.

474
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,038
- Just put the hat on.
- No.

475
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:13,832
What did you say?

476
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,088
Now, look at that.

477
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,091
I'm serious, you're impressive.

478
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,636
If I wasn't already married...

479
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:34,561
I look like a total jerk-off.

480
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,354
You do not.

481
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,318
What, are you crying?

482
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:44,571
- I don't wanna go.
- You need toughening!

483
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,114
Tony!

484
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:53,079
- Stand up straight.
- I'm standing fucking straight!

485
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:55,749
Hey, you keep it up, goddamn it!

486
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,176
I think...

487
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:11,848
Think the hat goes on the crook
of your arm here. Like that.

488
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,850
You look good.

489
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,028
Oh, my God!

490
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,905
- Anthony!
- A.J! A.J!

491
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:29,366
Get some water or something.

492
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,409
My son...

493
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,372
...has panic attacks.

494
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:41,044
Obviously, we can't send him
to military school.

495
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,380
Pediatrician said.

496
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:49,386
He's got that putrid
fucking Soprano gene!

497
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:53,556
It's a slight tic
in his fight/flight response.

498
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:59,896
It doesn't brand him as anything.

499
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:05,568
You know, it comes down
through the ages.

500
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:10,573
My great-great-great-grandfather
drove a mule cart off a road.

501
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,785
He was taking valuable jugs
of olive oil.

502
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,704
Probably was a panic attack.

503
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:22,085
When you blame your genes,
you're blaming yourself.

504
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:25,922
And that's what we should
be talking about.

505
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,591
Fucking Verbum Dei school.

506
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:33,221
It happened before,
but they didn't tell us.

507
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:37,934
Idiot nurse diagnosed it
as dehydration from football practice.

508
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:41,938
Can you believe
they didn't inform the parents?

509
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,441
I'm not a litigious person.

510
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:49,362
I prefer to resolve things directly,
but this time I'll sue!

511
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:53,825
Well, that's your right.

512
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:09,257
Anthony?

513
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:20,768
- You don't understand.
- Make me understand.

514
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,648
- We can't send him to that place.
- Yes?

515
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:28,568
How we gonna save this kid?

516
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:56,888
Your mother.

517
00:41:57,056 --> 00:42:00,433
- Come on, let's go.
- Silvio Manfred Dante?

518
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:04,020
- At a funeral?
- Detective Filemon Francis.

519
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:10,276
You're under arrest for violating New
Jersey penal code, promoting gambling.

520
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:14,364
Every fucking Super Bowl,
the D.A. grabs a few headlines.

521
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:18,868
Go ahead. Last year I made bail
so fast my soup was still warm.

522
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:21,871
All right, come on. Keep moving.

523
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:52,235
- Jesus Christ, you told me 11:00.
- I'm sorry.

524
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,737
Sorry, that's all I hear.

525
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:56,656
Junior, look.

526
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:01,744
Junior!

527
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:04,080
Junior, don't leave me!

528
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:14,924
"In certain hope of the resurrection
to eternal life through Christ...

529
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:18,428
...we commend to Almighty God
our brother...

530
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:22,140
...Giacomo Michael Aprile, Jr.

531
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:25,310
We commit his body to the ground..."

532
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:26,686
(SCREAMING)

533
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,273
No!

534
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:36,195
Why? Why Jackie?
Why my baby? Why?

535
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:40,283
"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

536
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,535
The Lord bless and keep him.

537
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:46,998
The Lord make his face
to shine upon him and be gracious.

538
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:51,836
The Lord lift up his countenance
upon him and give him peace."

539
00:43:57,801 --> 00:44:00,470
Someone should go down to Artie's.

540
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:03,348
Stop thinking, Ro.
Let's get you to bed.

541
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:08,853
He opened up the restaurant for us.
All those people...

542
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:29,832
(TV CLICKING ON)

543
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:36,172
- Was he dealing while you were dating?
- Mackenzie.

544
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,841
- Shut your mouth.
- I was just asking.

545
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:41,052
Oh, please. Okay?

546
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:46,599
My brother's stupid, pathetic dream
was to follow our father's footsteps.

547
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:51,854
I gotta paint a picture? He was killed
by a fat fuck in see-through socks.

548
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:54,899
Take your pick, they all look alike.

549
00:44:56,360 --> 00:45:01,364
Actually, Kelli, you really
have no basis to say that.

550
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:06,869
We used to joke around about
our families. What happened to you?

551
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:11,541
I know this is a really painful
time for you, but...

552
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:15,378
...your brother's best friend
was an Israeli X dealer.

553
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:19,090
- I met him.
- Wow! So it was international.

554
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:22,093
Let's just drop it, okay?

555
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:24,971
Yeah, right.

556
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:29,892
If my dad still controlled crime
in North Jersey like your dad does...

557
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,937
...I'd want to drop it too.
But then...

558
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:35,231
...it might not have happened.

559
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:38,067
Wait, this is way beyond.

560
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:41,154
Our dads are in the garbage business.

561
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:44,407
And they do brush up against
organized crime.

562
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:49,954
But you think they control
every slimeball and illegal gun?

563
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:56,252
The fact that you would say this in
front of an outsider is amazing to me.

564
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,337
Jesus Christ, some loyalty?

565
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:03,092
Their names etched in history.

566
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:08,431
Their hands around football's most
revered trophy. Immortalized...

567
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,603
- How are you?
- Good.

568
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:18,441
- Want a drink?
- I gotta go. Ma's alone.

569
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:35,666
He's serving a full dinner, huh?

570
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:38,836
I'm done already.
It's good gravy today.

571
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:42,840
Sad day.

572
00:46:43,383 --> 00:46:44,258
Huhh.

573
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:47,386
Kid was always a dumb fuck,
wasn't he?

574
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:50,848
Didn't he almost drown
in 3 inches of water?

575
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:53,476
The penguin exhibit.

576
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:59,649
Jack tried to lay Jackie's problems
on a learning disorder, but...

577
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:03,653
Stupidity would be
a learning disorder.

578
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:06,155
Look at this crappy turnout.

579
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:12,036
If Jackie Sr. was boss, with a child
dead, this place would be filled.

580
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:18,209
Flower cars up and down the block. No
matter what the boy had done. Now...

581
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:32,598
Bobby says you're out from under
the house arrest. Congratulations.

582
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:36,352
My lawyer was able to show
I'm not a flight risk.

583
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:42,024
Flight risk. I been farting into
the same sofa cushion for 18 months.

584
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:44,861
- RICO trial's coming.
- Least you're out.

585
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:47,029
And eating regular food.

586
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:52,702
The illness changed my viewpoint.
I'm gonna stop and smell the roses.

587
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,704
We all should.

588
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:57,874
I mean, what the fuck?

589
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:08,718
In the museum of noses,
there goes the Mona Lisa.

590
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:12,597
- Why are you out here?
- Ginny thinks I quit.

591
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:16,893
Jesus Christ. Fucking underboss
of a Five Families family.

592
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:19,604
Ginny can get heavy.

593
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:27,820
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

594
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:29,906
You can tell Uncle John.

595
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:36,579
Tony knows my mother's ill, then rules
against me in this Morristown shit.

596
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:39,957
- Maybe you heard.
- I don't stick my beak in.

597
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:43,502
Since Ralphie's bringing him
Esplanade scarole...

598
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:46,589
...Tony acts like I have a load
in my pants.

599
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:50,593
- No.
- I'm not insensitive. I hurt too.

600
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:55,306
- You think Tony plays favorites?
- What do I say to Ma?

601
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:58,309
She thinks she's going
to this paradise.

602
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:01,812
Same one his mother
stayed at for a year.

603
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:05,983
Don't confuse money with care.
Look how he treated her.

604
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:08,444
He's my dear friend, but come on.

605
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:13,491
I just said that to Junior. That maybe
Tony don't respect the elderly.

606
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:16,160
You said that to Junior?

607
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:18,955
What are you making, minestrone?

608
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:24,293
You know, Carmine sometimes
gets frustrated with Tony.

609
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:26,712
And Ralphie. That generation.

610
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:31,133
He thinks the Esplanade thing
wasn't handled right, risk-wise.

611
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:33,803
How is Carmine?

612
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:38,015
- He asks about you.
- Send my love.

613
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:40,309
I will. They like hearing that.

614
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:44,397
He's not well either, you know.

615
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:50,194
If there's ever anything I can do,
anything, he shouldn't hesitate.

616
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:53,906
I'll tell him.

617
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:59,370
You okay?

618
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:01,831
Yeah.

619
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:08,170
You had a few drinks over there.

620
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:12,341
We all could use it.

621
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:17,596
I was thinking before.

622
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:20,850
About what you once said.

623
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:25,354
How you have to max out the good
times with the people you love.

624
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:29,442
God, am I learning that
that is so true.

625
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:32,236
Actually, your father said that.

626
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:39,201
Anyway, when you see how people
deal with each other...

627
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:43,456
- Even families. Like Jackie's family.
- What about them?

628
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:46,375
Were never there for him.

629
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:49,879
I mean, Aunt Ro's sweet,
but she's, like, hello.

630
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:51,714
Uncle Jackie?

631
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:54,050
So narcissistic.

632
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:56,761
They let him do whatever he wanted.

633
00:50:56,928 --> 00:51:01,098
You'd ask, "Aren't you afraid
what your parents will say?"

634
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:02,767
About whatever...

635
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:06,562
And he would just go,
"They don't give a shit."

636
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:11,609
But I think it hurt
his feelings inside.

637
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:14,987
Well, I'm glad you see.

638
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:18,616
Yeah, right. You're glad I see.

639
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:21,911
You take this as an excuse
to get controlling.

640
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,622
That is not what I'm talking about!

641
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,749
What did I say?

642
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:33,297
- You're out from under our roof.
- Then you'll use it against A.J.

643
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:35,674
Against him?

644
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:38,761
I'm sorry I said anything!

645
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:47,770
Bearded stranger turns, rabbi goes,
"Don't touch me, I'm on disability!"

Come on, let's go!

What the hell?

657

That's right!

658
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:15,900
I beat cancer.

659
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:18,235
Now I'm gonna beat the can.

- What's that?
- Cosmo.

He's not bad when
he's had a few 'bucas.

666

I said come here!

675
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:43,505
This is such bullshit!

676
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:46,800
Meadow!

Hey, guys. Let's go.

680
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:59,188
Come on.

681
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:11,408
- Back to school, I guess.
- Did you give her money for the bus?

682
00:56:11,576 --> 00:56:15,788
I don't know. She got her purse.
She'll be all right.

684
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:30,302
Stand still. And be quiet.

686
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:06,422
What's that mean? Cuore ingrato?

687

Ungrateful heart.
