This is so amazing!

00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:57,908
Hey.

5
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:02,412
Oh, my God. How you just said "hey"
to me? You are so nice.

6
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:07,126
I mean, I knew that the first day
you saw me. Hug me.

7
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,004
Try it.
I'm so not depressed anymore.

8
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,798
Try what?

00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,967
Ecstasy!

10
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:19,596
- Where did you get it?
- Your friend.

11
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:23,934
- What the fuck is he doing at Columbia?
- He's fucking cute!

12
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:27,896
Our families are friends.
I've known him forever.

13
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,650
You like that?

14
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,861
I choose you.

15
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,659
Having fun?

16
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,996
- Not as much as Caitlin.
- You see her look at me?

17
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:46,540
The lid. From Okla-fucking-homa.

18
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:50,669
- You're in a frat now?
- Rutgers chapter.

19
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,338
I came up here to see you.

20
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,424
Got any more X?

21
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,969
For you, the first hit's free.

22
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:11,231
- Just don't tell your dad.
- I don't even talk to him anymore.

Read them and suck my dick! Yes!

24
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,451
Yes, baby!

25
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:25,120

that's mine.

26
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,872
He still got the dice?

27
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:32,169
- I own these fucking dice.
- You're making me a rich man, Ralphie.

28

- What can I get you guys?

How you doing?

- What's wrong? The Skip's here.
- I'm on a roll.

You'll be on a slab, you keep it up.

35
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,082
- Hey.
- Hey, Ton.

36
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,418
I'm sorry, this fucking guy...

37
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,558
Hello, Anthony.

38
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:38,568
You look good.

39
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,077
Want a drink?

40
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,871
Another time, Anthony.

41
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,042
Another time.

42
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:07,139
Let's whack this cocksucker
and be done with it.

43
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,766
I'm here to enjoy myself.

44
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:17,524
I'm so fucking hard.

45
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:24,656
No, Jackie, don't.

46
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:37,002
Meadow. Meadow, wake up.

47
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,712
I'm so sleepy.

48
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:43,967
You drank too much fucking tequila.
Come on, I can't stop now.

49
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:22,547
- "Another time, Anthony"?
- Cocksucker turns his back on me?

50
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:25,675
- Couldn't believe it.
- I could have shot him.

51
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:29,388
Don't be surprised if
Paulie pops the question.

52
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,599
Ralphie's star is rising.

53
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:37,020
All those unions. Paulie can't
come near that kind of cash.

54
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:42,025
- Ralphie's a good earner.
- Guy like that? Loose cannon.

55
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,736
He'll pull a Jack Ruby on you.

56
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:50,242
- Why did I have to punch this asshole?
- I was a little surprised.

57
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:54,037
Are you gonna start on me now?
He disrespected the Bing.

58
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:57,749
So? He's barred from the place.

59
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:05,215
- He bashed that poor girl's brains in.
- I hear you. I know.

60
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:08,802
It was a tragedy.
The fact is though...

61
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:13,723
...she was not related to you.
She was not your goomar.

62
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:19,604
Ralphie's a made guy. All things
considered, he has a legitimate beef.

63
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:26,445
Make him disappear. Or make nice.
You only got two choices.

64
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:33,827
- I would suggest an apology.
- Absolutely fucking not!

65

Do something to show
there's no bad blood.

66
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:41,251
Give him...
Give him a piece of the casino.

67
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:46,590
We're with New York on that. I don't
want him close to Johnny Sack.

68
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:51,678
You could bump him up to captain.
It's what he's been wanting, you know.

69
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:54,973
Ralphie, a fucking captain?

70
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,394
Over my dead body.

71
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,149
Thank you.

72
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,820
You see that shit before?

73
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:13,867
Tony's face when I turned down
that drink. Buy me a drink? Fuck you.

74
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,620
He knew it was wrong what he did.

75
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:19,498
He's the boss.
He can do what he wants.

76
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,834
Boss or no,
you don't hit another made guy.

77
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:26,505
Joe Mo from Mulberry Street.
Exact same situation.

78
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,841
He smacked a guy from Bergen.
Huge problem.

79
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:34,846
Of course. Rules are rules,
otherwise what? Fucking anarchy.

80
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:37,182
He owes you an apology.

81
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:41,853
With the money I put in his pocket,
the prick should hit his knees.

82
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:47,108
What? You think I'm afraid
of that fat fuck? No offense.

83
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:51,905
I could see if it was
his daughter or a niece.

84
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,242
But all this over some dead whore.

85
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:01,039
- He had to be fucking her.
- No. He knew you were.

86
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:05,919
That's why, that's how he is.
Like a dog with two bones.

87

I'm supposed to go to Tony's
for Thanksgiving. Me and Ro.

88

- Really?
- Fuck him and his turkey.

a drumstick up his ass.

Meatballs and scarole,
then the baked manicotti.

- Then the bird.
- Oh, I love manicotti.

He refused to have a drink with you?

106
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,449
So?

107
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:23,455
He refused because he's a
despicable fuck that I bitch-slapped.

108
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,790

to Thanksgiving with Rosalie.

- You know. The usual.

Nana, Grandpa, Chris and Ade. Janice
is bringing someone from her church.

122

- Aunt Ro and Uncle Ralph.
- Jackie's probably not coming, right?

123

- Why?
- Can't I just ask anything?

That's good. I'm feeding an army.

Not as many as you think.
Call Rosalie and cancel with them.

- Thanksgiving? Why?
- Just do it.

- I just talked to her. What do I say?

won't be nearly as nice as yours.

- Ro, it's Carm.

173
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:27,967
This is short notice but I just
got off the phone with Ma.

174
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,428
- What's the matter?
- It's my dad.

175
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,932
They had some troubling test results.

176
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:37,936
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, I know.

177
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:41,064
They have to do further testing.

178
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:45,777
Ma wants a quiet Thanksgiving.
Just the two of them, but...

179
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,112
They should be with family.

180
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:54,702
- I feel awful giving so little notice.
- I wish I could do something.

181
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:59,082
That is so sweet. I'll let you know
when I know anything.

182
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,834
Okay. Take care, sweetheart. Bye.

183
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,462
All right. Bye-bye.

184
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:15,098
Carm's father, he's sick.
She had to cancel Thanksgiving.

185
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:27,318
- It's 3 a.m. and bam! Come wide awake.
- Something specific?

186
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:31,948
It's a management problem.
A situation with an underling.

187
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:37,829
Now it's partly my fault. But he never
should have done what he did.

188
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:41,416
What was it?
Could you tell me that?

189
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,752
Caused the...

00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:48,006

192
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:56,848
Particulars aren't important.
He fucked up.

193
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:03,062
Now, ordinarily I would,
you know, put him out to pasture.

194
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:06,983
But he's a very valuable
piece of manpower.

195
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:11,070
Is it complicated
by a personal relationship?

196
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:21,330

you told me about.

wrote this thing 2400 years ago.

199
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,554
And most of it still applies today.

200
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:40,391
Balk the enemy's power.
Force him to reveal himself.

201
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:44,520
I have to ask.
Are you in any sort of danger?

202
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:47,482
No, no. Can I go on?

203
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:52,195
Most of the guys I know
read Prince, Machiavelli.

204
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:58,242
And I had Carmela go and get
the Cliff Notes once. It was okay.

205
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:03,164
But this book is much better
about strategy.

206
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:15,093
I wanted to ask you about
the girl that was here today.

207
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:19,347
- The Mercedes saleslady.
- I'm sorry about the confusion.

208
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:24,852
- What does she need a shrink for?
- I can't talk about another patient.

209
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:30,441

how I served him at Kenny Rogers?

I don't know how things
are gonna go.

307
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,754
He might not go away.

- It's not good, Ralph.

323

- Don't talk crazy.

switch families, come with you guys?

- Carmine doesn't know who you are.
- You could tell him.

328

I know Tony can be difficult.

329

- A: She was a whore.

she was carrying.

00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,530
It was the fucking coke.

336
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:04,616
I should have never started
with that shit.

337
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:08,537
Fucking Miami,
it's all over the place.

338
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:12,458
- Tell Anthony you're sorry.
- I was high, I admit it.

339
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:15,419
And I'm not doing it anymore.

340
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,756
- "Tony, I'm sorry..."
- What good would it do?

341
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:23,594
- It might save your life!
- He hit me.

342
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,930
He was wrong. Believe me, he knows.

343
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:34,646
- People are laughing behind my back.
- Talk to Tony. He'll make it right.

344
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:37,649
At this point, how?

345
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:39,443
I don't know.

346
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,782
Would you take capo of your crew?

347
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:49,286
No. No, I wouldn't. No fucking way.

348
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,955
Ralph Cifaretto came by.

349
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:56,794
What'd he want? A fully fueled jet
and a safe trip to the pope?

350
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:59,421
He's scared
since you canceled dinner.

351
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:03,592
If your opponent is
of choleric temper, irritate him.

352
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,931
- Yeah, well, he wants to apologize.
- Oh, really?

353
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:11,767
Would that put this to rest?

354
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:17,689
If it's sincere, it might relieve me
of an unpleasant decision.

355
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:22,486
They're about to break ground
on the Esplanade.

356
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,655
We're talking about millions.

357
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:28,575
Be nice to have a man in there
who feels appreciated.

358
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:34,081
It wouldn't hurt to throw him a bone.

359
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,833
Like what?

360
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:42,339
- Capo.
- No fucking way. Never.

361
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:47,386
You heard what he did.
That poor girl just turned 20.

362
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,890
Capo's what he mentioned.
I threw cold water on it right away.

363
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,019
But she was a whore, Tony.

364
00:30:56,354 --> 00:31:01,733
I don't want to talk about that
ever again. You understand me?

365
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:05,863
It was just a suggestion.
Keep a happy shop.

366
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:10,617
- You weren't gonna stick your beak in.
- Can't two friends talk?

367
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:14,288
I talked to him.
He's delighted you wanna see him.

368
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:19,710
Great. He said that? That's great.
That's fucking great news.

369
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,336
What'd I tell you?

370
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:25,716
The other thing, what's he
gonna do to make that right?

371
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:29,219
He indicated he's open
to working something out.

372
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:35,434
Thank you. Thank you. Anything.
Thank you, thank you.

373
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:43,275
Oh, Fabian.
Fuck you doing up before noon?

374
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:49,197
- I'm moving out. Over to Dov's.
- Beanie boy?

375
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:52,409
His reserve unit in Israel
got called up.

376
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,078
God bless America, huh?

377
00:31:56,247 --> 00:32:01,960
Listen, you find yourself
short on X, I know a guy.

378
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:04,922
- X?
- What?

379
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:08,467
I'm trying to do you a favor.

380
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:14,306
And that bullshit your future
father-in-law pulled on Thanksgiving?

381
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:19,102
He knew I had no intention of going.
He's trying to save face.

382
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:23,482
He stooped so low,
he had his wife lie to your mother.

383
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:28,445
Whatever you need, give me a call.
Be good.

384
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:39,122
The woman is 50 years old. Sometimes
I just wanna scream in her face:

385
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:43,460
"Quit whining! No wonder he left you!"

386
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:49,257
Her supervisor looks at her cross-eyed
and I get a call at 3 a.m.

387
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:55,973
She wants to talk about how her father
used to laugh at her when she was 7.

388
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:00,811
- Did she call your emergency number?
- That's not the point, Elliot!

389
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:04,064
Oh, these fucking interruptions.

390
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:10,487
- I was raped.
- You have feelings, and who listens?

391
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:13,073
That's right, damn it.

392
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:19,579
I have to sit there and take care
of these people hour after hour.

393
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:24,835
With all their problems.
And some of them are very real.

394
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:31,091
And very serious. And I'm sorry.
I care, I really do.

395
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:37,347
But it's hard sometimes.
I just wanna say, "I hurt."

396
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:42,060
Good. Sure.
That's why you're here.

397
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:45,313
I'm sorry, Elliot.

398
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:48,233
No need to be sorry.

399
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:52,070
You've been through such trauma.

400
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:56,700
It takes tremendous strength
of will and inner resource...

401
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,369
...to soldier on as you do at work.

402
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,872
Thank you, Elliot.

403
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:09,671
I try. I really do.
It's just hard sometimes.

404
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:18,305
And Patient Soprano?
How's all that?

405
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:22,100
He offered to escort me to my car.

406
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:26,521
I almost fell in his arms crying.

407
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,358
Oh, Jesus Christ.

408
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,403
(DOOR OPENING)

409
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,032
Chris.

410
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:39,701
- Paulie.
- Ralphie.

411
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,978
(CLEARING THROAT)

412
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,531
You wanted to see me?

413
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:21,451
- Yeah, Tony.
- About what?

414
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:25,455
About what? You know...

415
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,041
...to apologize.

416
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:29,793
Oh.

417
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,675
Sit down?

418
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:48,103
I was doing a lot of coke.

419
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:51,982
I said some things
and I did some things...

420
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:55,277
...that I'm sorry for.

421
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,114
It's not gonna happen again.

422
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,618
What'd you do?

423
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,290
I was rude...

424
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,543
...when you offered me the drink.

425
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:16,464
And I disrespected the Bing.

426
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,054
And the girl.

427
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:33,148
That shouldn't have happened.
Like I said, I was doing a lot of coke.

428
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,944
I gave that up.

429
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:42,240
And end of story.

430
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:48,705
And I'm sorry, Tony. Okay?

431
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,848
Anything else?

432
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:25,992
- Hey.
- How's it going, Geeg?

433
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:30,330
- Hey, Geeg.
- My wife made some turkey sandwiches.

434
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:35,252
- I'm bloated from Thanksgiving.
- Thanksgiving, 1982.

435
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:39,422
Fucking turkey. It's like Spackle
in my bowels. Nothing moves.

436
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:42,926
- You want some Metamucil?
- No, I hate that shit.

437
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:47,555
Think I'll try one
with lettuce and cranberry.

438
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:51,559
- Ralph around?
- No. Want me to call him?

439
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:55,563
Please. Let's just enjoy
the quiet, huh?

440
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:58,525
After decades of planning,
ground was broken...

441
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:03,613
...on Newark's Museum of Science and
Trucking and Riverfront Esplanade.

442
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:07,117
Oh, hi, Ralphie. Come on in.
He's watching TV.

443
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:11,288
The project was held up
by political infighting.

444
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:14,291
Nothing. He gave me nothing.

445
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:19,921
Look, the fucking Esplanade.
We'll need bulldozers for the money.

446
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:24,759
Not a thank you, not an apology.
Nothing!

447
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:28,847
- Calm down, take it easy.
- He let me stand there like...

448
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:33,768
...a servant. Scraping. Bowing.

449
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,646
Didn't even ask me to sit down.

450
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:39,482
- It's part of the game.
- He's going down.

451
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:44,779
- Are you fucking stupid?
- I don't give a fuck any more.

452
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:50,452
I've given my life to this thing.
And this is the thanks I get?

453
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,509
(KNOCKING)

454
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:11,598
- It's Silvio Dante on the phone.
- Tell him I'll call him back.

455
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:16,019
- They're my children, Thorne.
- You seriously cannot be...

456
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:17,312
(DOOR OPENING)

457
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:22,067
I'm so sorry!

458
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,694
You shut the door?

459
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:30,283
Jesus, you're worse than Bobby.

460
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,662
- Anybody see you come in?
- Yeah.

461
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:38,249
Fuck them. I don't care anymore.

462
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:42,045
I brought some leftover turkey
and stuffing.

463
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,758
Keep it. Everything goes through me.

464
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:50,428
And these drafts.
I should be down in Boca.

465
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:55,392
Drafts? It's like the fucking
Amazon jungle in here.

466
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:58,895
- What's the thermostat say?
- Don't touch it!

467
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:04,859
All right. Jesus.

468
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:19,916
Grandpa. Did he ever work
for somebody named Trillo?

469
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:24,921
- He owned a lumberyard?
- Dad was a mason. He didn't cut wood.

470
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:30,135
A contractor, then.
Built garden apartments?

471
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:35,723
There was a guy named Trillo. He had
seven daughters. I can't remember.

472
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:42,772
I thought you were gonna ask
my advice about Ralph Cifaretto.

473
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:52,157
- Got any thoughts?
- What else do I have left?

474
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:57,287
Real contretemps you have
on your hands here.

475
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:04,461
- You shouldn't have put Gigi in there.
- Strong, good earner, well-respected.

476
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:09,591
Not by that crew. To them he's
a Ghibelline coming over to butt in.

477
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,634
They don't trust him.

478
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:14,971
Plus, you got Ralph now
pissing in their ears.

479
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:18,641
Any day, you'll have a mutiny
on your hands.

480
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:22,937
So I take Gigi out.
What kind of message is that?

481
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:27,692
- That you're unsure of yourself.
- Exactly.

482
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:31,821
- Who do I replace him with?
- Good question.

483
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:36,367
- Great. What's the fucking answer?
- Who says there is one?

484
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:40,538
That's what being a boss is.
Steer the ship the best you can.

485
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:44,667
Sometimes it's smooth,
sometimes rocky. In the meantime...

486
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:47,754
...you find your pleasures
where you can.

487
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:52,300
(KNOCKING)

488
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:57,263
How much longer, Skip?
I gotta take a leak.

489
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:14,239
Holy Jesus!

490
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:29,045
What the fuck you looking at?
Call 9-1-1.

491
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,840
I don't feel a pulse.

492
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:36,302
(TV CHATTER)

493
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:44,894
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you, Tony.

494
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:50,733
He was a good man. Never said
a bad word about anybody.

495
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,821
Thank you, Tony.

496
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:17,927
It's fucking awful.
He was a young man.

497
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:20,597
Heart disease.

498
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,975
The silent killer.

499
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:28,354
Hey, there are worse ways to go.

500
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:34,360
Even still, on the pisciatoio?
Pretty fucking humiliating.

00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:36,613
It's how Elvis died.

502
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:42,910
That guy in Hollywood too. Don something.
Producer of The Simpsons.

503
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:52,754
So there's a vacancy.
There's a lot of business to do.

504
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:56,007
You thought about who it's gonna be?

505
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:36,130
Terrible. It's a terrible thing.
Guy was in here twice a week.

506
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:39,300
Brought the kids
and everything on Sundays.

507
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:50,019
Artie. Hey, Ton.

508
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:55,191
I gotta go rotate my pork shoulder.

509
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:03,449
- You wanted to see me?
- Sit down.

510
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:16,212
I'm making you captain.

511
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:23,052
You are? That's great.
That's fucking great.

512
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:28,224
Anthony, you're not gonna be sorry.
Thank you.

513
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:40,069
What?

514
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:48,745
I need to hear it was merit.

515
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:55,626
And not just because somebody
was constipated and blew a gasket.

516
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:04,927
You're gonna be making a lot
more money. So don't question.

517
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:07,764
You wanted captain, you're captain.

518
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:11,476
Thank you, Tony. You're right.

519
00:46:13,061 --> 00:46:15,980
I have wanted this so fucking long.

520
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:18,191
Well...

521
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,820
Well, you know what they say?

522
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:26,783
Be careful what you wish for,
you just might get it.

523
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:32,288
So, um...

524
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:37,001
So we gonna have a drink together
or what?

525
00:46:55,646 --> 00:47:02,652
(RAP MUSIC PLAYING)

526
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:12,954
So, what's this shit I hear about Tony
having a fight with Ralph Cifaretto?

527
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:14,622
On Thanksgiving?

528
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:20,169
- I was there.
- At Tony's? On Thanksgiving?

529
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:23,714
After dinner. To take Meadow out.

530
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:32,807
- Did you fuck her yet?
- Her body is mad ripe.

531
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:38,020
- Yeah, but did you fuck her yet?
- She's creaming for me, man.

532
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:41,566
You didn't fuck her yet.

533
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:45,736
I don't know if it's smart.
She's Tony Soprano's daughter.

534
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:48,155
I'll be right back.

535
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,575
See you.

536
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:54,078
Jackie, come on, Vassar. That band.

537
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:58,332
- Come on, double or nothing.
- Yeah, rack them.

538
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:02,503
- You said you were gonna take me.
- Go sit down.

539
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:05,631
Ha, Ha, Ha.

540
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:10,219
Fucking brat. Meadow!
Goddamn it!

(ENGINE STARTING)

542
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,695
Hey, no!

543
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,116
Meadow!

544
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,205
Oh, my God. Fuck. Meadow!

545
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:39,749
- Jackie...
- Jesus, Meadow.

546
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:42,209
- You all right?
- I think so.

547
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:46,714
- Easy. What's the matter?
- My purse is stuck.

548
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:52,762
- You guys all right?
- We're fine.

549
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:55,765
We're fine.
Nobody got hurt. Blew a tire.

550
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:58,935
- But your car.
- I'll call it in stolen.

551
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:02,104
Oh, my God. Jackie, I am so sorry.

552
00:49:02,397 --> 00:49:06,776
As long as you're okay. I don't know
what I'd do if you got hurt.

553
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:09,779
- You almost died.
- I'm so sorry.

554
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:14,742
- I should have taken you to Vassar.
- You loved that car.

555
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:18,996
It's all right.
Come on, let's get you home.

556
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:23,167
No. I wanna go with you.

557
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:25,419
You're sure?

558
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:38,099
(CHATTERING)

559
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:06,127
Here's my card.
I'll be here at 10:00.

560
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:08,004
- Great.
- Nice to meet you.

561

Great. Nice meeting you.

562
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:14,260
Hey.

563
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:19,765
- It's you.
- I had my eye on one of these.

564
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:22,309
You have good taste.

565
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:26,564
Can I go for a test drive?

566
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:31,485
- You have to go with a sales rep.
- Anybody available?

567
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:33,487
- Dale!
- Yeah.

568
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:37,324
I'm going out. 600.

00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,166
Thanks.

Hello?

574
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:28,459
Jennifer, it's Gloria Trillo.
I'm sorry, but I can't make it today.

575
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:30,086
Everything all right?

576
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:34,965
- Yeah. Yeah, fine.
- All they had was wine coolers.

577
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:43,599
Well, I'm glad you called.
Do you want to reschedule?

578
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:48,229
No. I'll just see you next week
at the regular time.
