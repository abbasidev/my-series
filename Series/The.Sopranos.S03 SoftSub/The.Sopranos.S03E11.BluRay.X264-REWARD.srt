No, I'm sorry, he's not.

Who's calling?

10
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:54,631
This is Mrs. Washington, from
the high school, for little Anthony.

She wasn't from the school?
My God, she sounded so convincing.

25

- I'm just trying to be honest.
- Yeah? Why'd you lie?

- I didn't wanna piss you off.
- It's about you?

27

What? I didn't want
to hurt your feelings.

28
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:14,127
No, you didn't wanna piss me off,
meaning you'd have to deal with me...

29
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:18,340

than my fucking feelings!

not as optimistic as I once was.

- I'm the reason she's with Jackie?

It's fucking deserted down there.

dig a hole, end of story.

- You stick to your own kind, you know.

00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:12,261
Do you think having met her
in therapy is significant?

173
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:14,555
Maybe she reminds me of you.

174
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,265
Okay.

175
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:17,850
How?

176
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:21,354
Smart. Sexy. She's Italian.

177
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,859
She's actually nothing like you.

178
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,569
Well...

179
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,489
...maybe a little.

180
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,242
- Who else?
- You both got great legs.

181
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,245
- Keep joking.
- Don't get jealous.

182
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,080
It's your fault we met.

183
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,833
The scheduling mix-up?

184
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,294
Point is, she makes me happy.

185
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,508
Does she seem happy to you?

186
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:56,639
When she's with me.
And you know what? So am I.

187
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:05,440
Is lying to Carmela in therapy
the best thing for your panic attacks?

188
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:08,651
Things are good between us,
you said so.

189
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,570
It's predicated on a lie.

190
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:16,159
Predicate it on my ass, what's the
difference? I'm content, I'm relaxed.

191
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:19,245
Bottom line is, I'm a better
husband and father.

192
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:24,250
You wanna know the truth,
as much as I love my wife...

193
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:27,128
...being with Gloria
makes me happier...

194

...than all your Prozac
and your therapy bullshit, combined.

195

- I think we should have ate.

- Fuck your fucking mother!

pajamas in the middle of winter?

203
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:15,069
- Think this is far enough?
- It'll do.

204
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:21,576
- What the fuck you doing?
- You think we're digging the hole?

205
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:25,079
That's right, shithead. Get to work.

206

but give it some Siberian action.

207

208

- What's he saying?
- Who gives a shit?

214
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,981
Keep digging.

215
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:57,361
Not that it matters now, but we didn't
come to your house to kill you.

216
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:03,492

to shut the fuck up.

217
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:06,621

218

221
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:53,251
- I got him, didn't I?
- Yeah. Fuck!

222
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,586
Maybe he's stunned.

223
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:13,354
- How bad is it?
- Couple of stitches.

224
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:17,900
We'll finish him and cover him
with snow. You see where he went?

225
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:22,405
He's gotta be close.
Half his head's probably hanging off.

226
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:25,157
There's some blood over there.

227
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:34,709
Where is this prick?
Sure I hit him in the head?

228
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:37,253
Yeah, fucking positive.

229
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:42,133
I don't see any more blood.
It's like the trail just ended.

- Where you been?

- The Pine Barrens.
- Did you wrap the package?

238
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:29,513
Not yet. We were about to.
We had a little problem.

239
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,307
What problem?

240
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:35,978
The package hit Chrissy
with an implement and ran off.

241
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,314
I thought you said it was...

242
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:42,485
We thought it was. It's complicated.
We're looking for it.

243

- I can't hear you, you're breaking up.
- We're looking for it!

- I used to get sciatica...
- Could survive?

The package?

246
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:55,039
- Could the package survive?
- Ton?

247
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:58,334
Is there any way the
package could survive?

248

No, T. No fucking way.

- What?

- What'd he say?
- He's worried about this Slava asshole.

We're working with him, but you
wonder what Tony's got going.

- I'm a fucking captain.

- Back there, half a mile or so.

follow our own footprints. Come on.
