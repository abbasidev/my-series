(SOPRANOS THEME SONG)

2
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:44,770
I want you
to count backwards from 10.

3
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,857
Ten, nine...

4
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:52,945
...eight, seven...

5
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:56,990
Mr. Soprano, there's someone
here to see you.

6
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,911
Even here, you hector me?

7
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,706
The director has authorized us
to make you an offer.

8
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,793
Give up your nephew Tony.
Help take him down.

9
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:10,587
- What do I get?
- Guaranteed cure.

10
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:14,550
- No more cancer?
- Not a single diseased cell.

11
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:31,525
(LIVIA) I'm happy for you.
I know you've waited a long time.

12
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:35,320
- I don't like it.
- (LIVIA) Don't let people take advantage.

13
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:39,449
(TONY) I'm kidding, you old fuck.
What's the matter with you?

14
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:45,122
Dr. Kennedy? It's Dr. Enloe. I have
the results for the frozen section.

15
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:49,751
Can we move this along?
I have a thyroid in OR six at 10:30.

16
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:56,341
Based on the preliminary results
and depending on the full report...

17
00:02:56,551 --> 00:03:01,013
- Is it clean, Enloe, or not?
- Yes, it's clean.

18
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,348
- Miles, you close.
- Quickly.

19
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:06,643
I've got his BP up,
don't know for how long.

20
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:10,147
Watch and learn, Miles.
Watch and learn.

21
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,116
Well?

22
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:29,708
Your uncle is a very strong man.
He did very well. The news is good.

23
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,211
- Beautiful.
- So the cancer is?

24
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:36,048
Gone? You bet.
I took out a tumor the size of a fist.

25
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,216
Oh, Madonna.

26
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:41,220
So if you'll excuse me,
I have another patient waiting.

27
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:46,725
Cheryl, make sure Marty gets
that Goldman Sachs statement. Yes?

28
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,561
I just wanted to say thanks, you know?

29
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:54,316
My uncle thinks the world of you.
If there's anything I can do...

30
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:57,819
...a favor, anything, let me know.

31
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:01,240
I'll keep that in mind, Mr. Soprano.

32
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,247
Game three.

33
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:12,751
- That's $60.
- Good luck getting it.

34
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:15,671
I won, Paulie.
It's only right you pay.

35
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:18,090
- And for other things.
- Like what?

36
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:22,886
Fucking Dom Perignon for everybody
in the skybox at the Garden.

37
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,055
Check comes, you're MIA.

38
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:29,685
You're worried about what I give you.
Worry about what you give me.

39
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:35,440
- Blow me with your lectures.
- Kid, you wearing a wire?

40
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,442
You crazy?

41
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:40,612
- Pat him down.
- He fucking touches me...

42
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:45,534
Then make it easy on us all.
Take them off. Everything.

43
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:51,373
New York reopened the books, but
they laid down a probationary period.

44
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:55,127
When I was coming up,
this would never happen.

45
00:04:55,295 --> 00:05:00,799
- But too many are doing a simulcast.
- Yeah, maybe you, you fuck.

46
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:05,554
Do me a favor
and don't take it personally.

47
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,484
- Everything.
- Go fuck yourself.

48
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:25,115
Before, I was breaking balls.
Now you're beginning to worry me.

49
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:40,005
I guess you could call that a dick.

50
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,097
You're going.
That's all there is to it.

51
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:53,518
- Jason Mangelli isn't going.
- Tony, you want to weigh in here?

52
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,356
Tony?

53
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:01,526
- What?
- The Washington trip?

54
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:04,363
You're gonna be
on that bus tomorrow.

55
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:08,742
You're all packed and paid for
and you're gonna learn.

56
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:12,204
We're going to FBI headquarters.

57
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,790
So?

58
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:16,666
(BEEPING)

59
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,545
Excuse me.

60
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:28,970
What did you do to this scarole?
It's delicious.

61
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:30,514
Balsamic.

62
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:35,727
That's all they have at King's these
days. Balsamic, balsamic, balsamic.

63
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,313
My mother never heard of balsamic.

64
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:42,317
- I gotta go. Problems at work.
- It's Sunday dinner, Tony.

65
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:47,072
I know. I gotta go.
All right, Hugh, see you later.

66
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,495
- Can I be excused too?
- No, you may not.

67
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:57,999
He's got homework to finish
before the trip. Go ahead, Anthony.

68
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:03,255
- That's a nice example he sets.
- Ma.

69
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:07,759
The man's got two speeds, moping
or yelling, when he's here.

70
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:13,098
- He's got an uncle sick with cancer.
- They didn't speak for a year.

71
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:17,519
Actually, if you must know,
Tony has been better.

72
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:24,568
We've been seeing
his therapist together.

73
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:37,372
- What?
- He's no Angelo Stamfa, that's all.

74
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:41,293
- What does that mean?
- Angelo was dying to marry you.

75
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,837
Stamfa's is a chain of drugstores.

76
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:47,632
He doesn't need therapy?
He prescribes his own pills?

77
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,259
Don't be so sensitive.

78
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:53,638
What's sensitive?
I gotta hear this Stamfa shit again?

79
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:05,275
- All I was saying was...
- I know what you're saying.

80
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,777
Hugh, bring your plate.

81
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:12,616
You are blowing this all out
of proportion. We worry, that's all.

82
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:16,828
Spare me your concern, all right?
Spare me your attitude too.

83
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:22,334
Did you forget? Dad's mall was zoned
residential until Tony made a call.

84
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,252
- Bullshit.
- Oh, really?

85
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:29,674
That contract at Sparta High? The
other builders were too busy to bid?

86
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:34,304
My heart bleeds. The waters don't
part for you wherever you go?

87
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:39,017
I earn it. You two get a free pass.

88
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,233

- Hey, Tony.

- Georgie. It's wacky, huh?

92
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:26,690
- You think it's a playroom back there?
- What?

93
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:31,027

That's an office.

Yeah, I...

101
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,039
I wanted to make sure
it was okay if I came alone.

102
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:27,792
I mean, because Tony couldn't make it.

00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,138
Thank you.

00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,059
That statue is not my favorite.

108
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:59,616
It's not like this when Tony's here.
You never give the silent treatment.

109
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:04,621
Is that what you think?
I'm giving you the silent treatment?

110
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:09,668
You could tell me why you came today.

111
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:15,465
I'm worried about my husband.
The mood swings.

112
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:20,178
I thought when his mother died,
maybe...

113
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:26,518
But... still half the time
he doesn't even talk to me.

114
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:30,939
You've seen him like that,
that day he sat here like a wall.

115
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:34,859
I know he's your patient
and I'm the patient's wife...

116

see how you feel.

For your information,
I am not the only one.

119

Tony isn't under the weather.
He didn't feel like coming.

120
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,209
"Fuck that shit," he said.

121

Usually happens
when we touch on a nerve.

122
00:11:55,673 --> 00:12:01,469
He was distressed about this young
man's death in the garbage compactor.

123

See, he didn't say
garbage compactor, did he?

124

See?

125
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:11,855
- What do you believe?
- You know his job.

126
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:16,901
He reports to a strip club.
Who knows how he spends his days?

127

I'm sorry. I'm just frustrated.

128
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:41,593
Tony has been out of sorts for so long
and there's nothing I can do to help.

129
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:47,015
I think coming to therapy with him
has stirred feelings in you...

130
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,726
...that you would like to address.

131
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:53,188
Oh, please. I'm just emotional today.

132
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:58,902

pointed out, your husband's my patient.

I am not the one who needs
mental help. I just needed to vent.

135
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:14,584
...here's the number of
a colleague in Livingston.

00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,177
He was a teacher of mine.

some malignant cells we didn't get.

When we operate...

145
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:18,147
...we have to decide how much healthy
tissue to cut around the tumor.

146
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:24,320
The margins weren't wide enough.
We took a small sampling of the tumor.

147
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:29,200
When we got back the complete results,
it showed nodal involvement.

00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,374
- What a surprise.
- I didn't know you shopped over here.

166
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:03,836
They're running a special on lams.
Every penny counts.

167
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:07,590
How are you doing, Angie,
with Pussy gone?

168
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:10,885
I tell you, shopping for one
is no picnic.

169
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:15,640
Why don't you come for dinner?
It's just me and Tony.

170
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:18,601
Who knows? Maybe we'll get lucky
and Tony won't show.

171
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,852
(LAUGHING)

172
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:28,820
- That's Cocoa's worst time of the day.
- That dog is not a substitute.

173
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,240
That French poodle is
all I got left of Sal.

174
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:35,618
He disappears one day
and I get a sick dog.

175
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:39,914
The vet says to put her down,
but I want another operation.

176
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:43,459
With Sal, there was nothing
too good for that dog.

177
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:46,963
But where am I gonna come up
with $1200?

178
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:52,635
Tony helps out and I am so grateful.
It covers the basics.

179
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:55,346
But anything extra, there's no way.

180
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:59,183
Angie, I'm sorry.
That must be so tough.

181
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:01,436
I told the wallpaper guy
that this was okay.

182
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:03,229
Well, why did you
do that?

183
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,690
Because I didn't want to deal with
your parents anymore.

184
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:11,362
Anybody around here love
the word "Jimmy Choo shoes"?

185
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,990
No way.

186
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,205
Oh, my gosh, they're gorgeous!

187
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:27,128
Or would the lady prefer
something in gold?

188
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:32,508
Say a nice, I don't know,
whatever the fuck that is.

189
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:43,644
They're all yours. They're from next
season. You can't even buy them yet.

190
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,067
- What size are these?
- Ten.

191
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:54,197
Ten? That's Sasquatch size.
I'm a 81/2.

192
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:57,241
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
Where'd I get 10 from?

193
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,410
Yeah, where?

194
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:05,708
So now what happens?
I gotta give them all back?

195
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:10,213
Temporarily. I'll get you
81/2s tomorrow.

196
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,050
- All of them? You swear?
- More even.

197
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:24,268

I just can't believe the stuff we get.

Except for that Paulie. Fuck him
and the Coupe DeVille he rode in on.

200
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,861
He's saying
you're holding back again?

201
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:38,908
Like I'm gonna give that prick
a full share? Come here.

202
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,413
What do you say?

203
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:49,585
- I love you, baby.
- Oh, you fucking better.

204
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:52,588
- You better.
- I do.

You could've called.
Now everything's cold.

206

That's why they invented microwaves.
For inconsiderate husbands.

207

Since we're alone, it'd be nice
to have dinner together.

it's good like this.

dean. You won't be joining me?

215

We already shell out 40 grand a year.

learning. If she passes us by...

Isn't that what you want
for your kids?

219

No. I want them
to be backwards and ignorant.

220
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:17,048
And I'm gonna make sure of that by
not going to lunch with some asshole.

Fine, Tony. Don't go.

Guess who I ran into
at the supermarket today?

223
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:30,228
Angie Bonpensiero.

224
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,065
Really?

225
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,859
How's she doing?

00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,070
Her dog is sick.

piece of shit? What's wrong with him?

T.G.I. Friday's. He loves their wings.

232
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:09,267
He left Angie holding the bag. And
those FBI "family values" cocksuckers.

233
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:13,062
- They let him go without his wife.
- Into the program?

234
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:18,276
That's right. He ratted us out.
Me and you. That's where he is.

235

I don't want to hear about him
or his cunt wife.

237

- Easy. Chuckie Periccio's mother.

- You had sex with Beverly Periccio?
- Yeah. A whole summer's worth.

Who was your most famous?

I gave him head.

- The big one.

I can't? You must have not read up
on the latest rules.

He knows doctors.

329

He sent Silvio's mother to one.
It can't hurt.

- People come from the city see Kennedy.
- Then we won't be fighting traffic.

Come on, Uncle Jun,
you know I'm right.

332
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:24,905

You come with me.

Sort of. So the chemotherapy
would be instead of the surgery?

I can't guarantee it.
We'll evaluate the results.

- Your uncle will not be present.

taken around the site...

for a false negative.

to the board. What do we do?

- Mehta? Sloan-Kettering Mehta?

it'll be easier.

490
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:16,032
The girl said she'd page Dr. Kennedy.
Where is he?

491
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,869
Twenty minutes and I'll be back.

492
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:31,214
- You go too easy on him.
- Probably.

493
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:37,637
Hey, if my nephew Cubby wasn't dead,
I'd have a soft spot for him.

494
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,349
Did you sniff that girl's panties?

495
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:45,395
He told you that? Fucking baby!

496
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:49,732
- You got to apologize.
- I'm not apologizing to him.

497
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:53,361
You were out of line.
He's gonna marry the girl.

498
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:58,992
As of the wedding day, anything that
touches her pussy is off-limits.

499
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:08,042
Think it's all up?

500
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:14,007
Soon enough there'll be more
where that came from.

501
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:19,095
Sounds like you were going
at it in there.

502
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:22,432
My pain a source of entertainment?

503
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:28,563
You see me laughing? Brought you
a milk shake from 31 Flavors.

504
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:34,068
It's your fault. I've been throwing up
all day since I started the chemo.

505
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:37,864
Oh, right. I gave you cancer.

506
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:43,536
You don't know what this is like,
Anthony. I can't do it.

507
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:47,373
- Kennedy was right.
- What's he gotta say?

508
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:50,126
I can't get him.
They won't put me through.

509
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:51,461
Why not?

510
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:56,799
I leave messages at the hospital and
office. I sent him a box of cigars.

511
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:59,135
I couldn't get past reception.

512
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,971
- He didn't call?
- Do they even tell him?

513
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:05,475
The machine says
for an emergency, press 6.

514
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:11,773
I press 6. Still no callback
24 hours later. He must be busy.

515
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:15,068
Yeah, that must be it.

516
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,656
You got his number?

517
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:30,041
Three more weeks.
Three more fucking weeks.

518
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:36,673
Answering machine.

519
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:40,593
What are you gonna do?
These doctors, it's not like on TV.

520
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:46,140
Dr. Kennedy, this is Tony Soprano,
Corrado's nephew.

521
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:50,353
My cell phone is 917-555-0157.

522
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:56,359
Call me back anytime day or night.
It's important.

523
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,196
Batter up.

524
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:10,873
Bye.

525
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,898
- Now what?
- Get in.

526
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:47,493
You're not even married yet,
you're dipping into whores.

527
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:51,164
Didn't cost me a quarter.
I don't pay for it.

528
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,001
How'd you find me?

529
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:59,255
Better be careful. If I can do it,
so can your bride-to-be.

530
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:04,010
What is this? Some new rule about
who I fuck? You want more shoes?

531
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:11,142
No. They don't fit her. I don't know
why I thought she was a size 10.

532
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:15,605
- I don't know either.
- I'm here to tell you one thing.

533
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:20,610
You go whining to the Big Man again
about shit between us...

534
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:23,696
...we'll have a problem, my friend.

535
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,048
You seen these?

536
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:43,800
Fuck is that?

537
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:47,595
My godson got it for me.
They're all over the place.

538
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:50,973
We gotta bring one into the club.

539
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,811
(FISH SINGS SONG)

540
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:17,750
Watch and learn, Phil.
Watch and learn.

541
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:31,764
- What are you doing?
- It's me, Tony. Corrado's nephew.

542
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:33,766
You belong to this club?

543
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:39,438
- Me? No. I came here to see you.
- You'll have to call my office.

544
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:44,485
You need a new secretary.
You're not getting all your messages.

545
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:47,613
For you.

546
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:52,326
Titanium. I use one.
Added 10 yards to my drives.

547
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:57,665
- Thanks, but I can't accept it.
- For what you've done for my uncle.

548
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:03,504
I already got one
and Mr. Williams here, he don't play.

549
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:07,758
- Right?
- Stupid fucking game.

550
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:11,387
- What can I do with it?
- What is it, Jack?

551
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:14,265
He'll just be a minute!

552
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:23,733
- I could use a little extra distance.
- Who couldn't?

553
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:28,487
My uncle's not doing so well.
Bad reaction to the chemo.

554
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:31,908
That happens.
There's nothing that I can do.

555
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:36,662
There are worse things that
can happen to a person than cancer.

556
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:39,749
My uncle thinks he's gonna die.

557
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:43,586
You know how old people are
with their superstitions.

558
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:47,089
He thinks it's because
he went against you.

559
00:48:55,682 --> 00:48:58,225
I was his surgeon, that's all.

560
00:48:58,852 --> 00:49:01,103
You got a bee on your hat.

561
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:07,860
Show that man the respect he deserves.

562
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:12,114
Answer his phone calls.

563
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:26,337
Cheryl, make sure
Mr. Soprano is scheduled for...

564
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:28,923
Just remember it.

565
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:43,396
- Everybody's marriage has problems.
- Is he seeing another woman?

566
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:46,857
You can make that plural.
He sees other women.

567
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:49,860
I look the other way.
I want to help him.

568
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:53,280
Do you? Moments ago
you used the word "divorce."

569
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:57,451
I said I was considering divorce.

570
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:02,415
I may be overstepping my boundaries,
but aren't you Jewish?

571
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:04,875
Is that relevant?

572
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:11,007
Us Catholics place a great deal of
stock in the sanctity of the family.

573
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:16,303
- And I'm not sure that your people...
- I've been married for 31 years.

574
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:21,142
Well, then you know
how difficult it can be.

575
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:23,853
He's a good man, he's a good father.

576
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:30,818
You said he's a depressed criminal,
prone to anger, serially unfaithful.

577
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:34,488
Is that your definition
of a "good man"?

578
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:37,950
I thought psychiatrists
weren't judgmental.

579
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:41,662
Patients want to be excused
from their predicament...

580
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:44,999
...because of events
in their childhood.

581
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:48,502
That's what psychiatry
has become in America.

582
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:55,426
Visit any shopping mall or ethnic
pride parade to witness the results.

583
00:50:57,471 --> 00:51:02,224
- What we say in here stays in here?
- By ethical code and by law.

584
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:04,518
His crimes...

585
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:09,565
...they are organized crime.

586
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:11,567
The Mafia?

587
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,861
Oh, Jesus.

588
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:21,035
Oh, so what? So what?

589
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:24,371
He betrays me every week
with these whores.

590
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:28,084
Probably the least of his misdeeds.

591
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:33,964
You can leave now or you can stay
and hear what I have to say.

592
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:40,054
- You'll charge the same.
- I won't take your money.

593
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:41,472
That's a new one.

594
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:46,352
You must trust your initial impulse
and consider leaving him.

595
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,021
You'll never be able to feel good.

596
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:55,694
You'll never be able to quell
the feelings of guilt and shame...

597
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:58,572
...as long as
you're his accomplice.

598
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:02,118
- You're wrong about the accomplice.
- Are you sure?

599
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:06,580
All I do is make sure
he's got clean clothes and dinner.

600
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:11,627
So "enabler" would be a more accurate
job description than "accomplice."

601
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:14,421
My apologies.

602
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:23,639
So you think I need to define
my boundaries more clearly...

603
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:27,143
...keep a certain distance,
not internalize my...

604
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:29,270
What did I just say?

605
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:32,481
Leave him.

606
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:36,986
Take only the children,
what's left of them, and go.

607
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:40,823
My priest said I should try
and help him to be better.

608
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:43,534
How's that going?

609
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:52,668
Have you read Crime and Punishment?
Dostoyevsky?

610
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:57,047
It's not an easy read,
it's about guilt and redemption.

611
00:52:57,299 --> 00:53:01,969
And I think, were your husband
to turn himself in, read this book...

612
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:08,434
...reflect on his crimes for 7 years
in his cell, he might be redeemed.

613
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:11,979
I would have to get a lawyer...

614
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:16,358
...find an apartment,
arrange for child support...

615
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:19,153
You're not listening.

616
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:22,865
I'm not charging you
because I won't take blood money.

617
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:25,868
And you can't either.

618
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:30,372
One thing you can never say:

619
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:34,001
That you haven't been told.

620
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:37,838
I see.

621
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:40,299
You're right. I see.

622
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:49,099
You're poisoning me.
I don't know how much more I can take.

623
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:52,686
- You taking care of this young man?
- Dr. Kennedy!

624
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:56,190
How you doing?
I've been busy. You all right?

625
00:53:56,566 --> 00:54:01,612
Don't bullshit a bullshitter.
Will this work? Or should we operate?

626
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:03,739
- You got a top guy here.
- Him?

627
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:07,576
- I'd see him if I needed to.
- Son of a bitch.

628
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:10,871
Stay strong and keep fighting.

629
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:14,833
That's my home number.
You start to feel punk, you call.

630
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,335
Thanks.

631
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:21,131
I'll check on you Wednesday.
Take care of this young fellow.

632
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:46,865
- Carm.
- What?

633
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:50,536
You sick?

634
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:55,457
Everybody else in this family sleeps
all day, I thought I'd try it.

635
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,626
You...

636
00:54:57,877 --> 00:54:59,878
...depressed?

637
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:01,547
Or what?

638
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:07,136
I figure in the division of labor
around here, that's your job.

639
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:28,741
Because, you know, if you want to go
to therapy on your own or something...

640
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:32,786
I notice you been tense lately.

641
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:37,624
That's rich.
You suggesting I go to a shrink.

642
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:42,087
I don't have the time.

643
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:49,011
I'll still go to yours, if you want.

644
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:54,600
You know best.

645
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:58,854
- That dean called today.
- Well, that can't be good.

646
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:03,108
I told him to put us down
for the 50,000.

647
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:06,153
Carmela, I gave you 5.

648
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:11,658
Maybe I could go another 5.
Maybe 10, but that's enough.

649
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:19,792
Tony, you gotta do
something nice for me today.

650
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:23,545
And this is what I want.
You gotta do this.

651
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:28,884
All right, I'll go to 10.
That should be enough for them.

652
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:32,554
I already told him 50.

653
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:45,192
