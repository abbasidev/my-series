(POP MUSIC PLAYING)

3
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:36,238
The guy on 13th street,
I told him, Go see Gigi.

4
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,531
You call Beansie?

5
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:38,949
Gigi, Beansie?

6
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:42,327
Us Italians, I think we're the only ones
that use nicknames to that extent.

7
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:44,204
No, your Chinese.

8
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,289
Nah.

9
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,666
Yeah, this violinist, Yo-Yo Ma.

10
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,793
"Soubriquet"...

11
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,796
It's another word for nickname.

12
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:56,800
I'm sorry.

13
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,051
What's the matter, hon'?

14
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:58,844
Nothing.

15
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:00,554
Tony?

16
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,432
How you doing, sweetie?

17
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:04,057
Good, good.

18
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,602
I took Danny to the doctor
like you said.

19
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:11,523
My son.

20
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,192
Oh, yeah, yeah, Right, right.

21
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:13,984
How's he doing?

22
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,194
Good, you were right.

23
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:17,279
Just a chest cold,
not pneumonia, thank god.

24
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,530
Oh, great, great.

25
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,781
I'm glad to hear it.

26
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,620
I made you some bread.

27
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,663
You know, like a "thank you".

28
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,332
You didn't have to do that.

29
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,918
Oh, really, I wanted to,
it's datenut for breakfast.

30
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,085
Listen...

31
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:34,421
Tracee, right?

32
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,381
The bread's very sweet.

33
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,258
And you're a great girl.

34
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,595
Don't take this the wrong way,

35
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,264
But you can't be doing
stuff like this.

36
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:45,849
No good.

37
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,227
But I just wanted to say thanks.

38
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,228
I know.

39
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:52,397
But I already got a family,
they give me gifts.

40
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,901
What we have is
an employer/employee thing.

41
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,277
Can't we be friends?

42
00:03:57,445 --> 00:04:00,155
Well, I'm not so sure
that's such a good idea either.

43
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,241
'Cause, you know,
you and Ralphie...

44
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,159
Yeah, Ralphie.

45
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,744
I'm glad your kid's okay.

46
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:08,914
Let's go, Betty Crocker.

47
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,716
Bread.

48
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,929
So, Russell Crowe, I mean,
he's trapped, right?

49
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,473
They're gonna
sever off his head.

50
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,934
And he's telling them
how to do it?

51
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:31,979
I know, and then he yanks the sword
from that dude.

52
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,230
That was so phat.

53
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:36,024
What about when the guy gets
hit with that spike thing

54
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,567
And chunks of his head
go flying?

55
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:38,443
Enough already.

56
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,861
We're making conversation here.

57
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,196
People are trying to eat.

58
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:42,114
Thank you.

59
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,408
Why do you let him
watch this garbage?

60
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:48,078
"Erin Brockovich",
that was a nice one.

61
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,705
I didn't care for it.

62
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,456
You did too,
what are you talkin'?

63
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,041
(DOORBELL)

64
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,210
See who that is.

65
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,380
Since when did
I become the butler?

66
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,842
It's probably Jackie JR.,
he locked himself out.

67
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,427
No accountability, this kid.

68
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,512
What, people forget their keys.

69
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,597
There he is...

70
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,141
Fresh Prince of New Jersey.

71
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:10,642
Hey.

72
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:12,269
How you doing?

73
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,314
Don't get up, Don't get up.

74
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,481
I'll fix you a plate.

75
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,066
Sit down, have something to eat.

76
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,402
No, I can't, Dino Zerilli's
out in the car.

77
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,654
You sure, something quick?

78
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,406
Why don't you go bring him in?

79
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,449
Next time.

80
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,242
I'll leave them in the mailbox.

81
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:28,744
That's alright,
we'll use my set.

82
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,287
I'll put them on the counter.

83
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,205
What am I,
the invisible man here?

84
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,457
Hey.

85
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,167
Hey, man, your sister around?

86
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,377
She decided to stay
at school and study.

87
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:38,170
Any message?

88
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:39,963
No, just, you know, hello.

89
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,923
Alright, I'm gonna hit the road.

90
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,800
Sorry to interrupt your dinner.

91
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:44,968
Stay out of trouble.

92
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,636
So handsome.

93
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:47,804
Good kid.

94
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,848
Little pig-headed,
if you ask me.

95
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:54,686
Every advantage, this kid.
College, good home life.

96
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:58,565
I had to quit school
when I was in 11th grade

97
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,609
To help my mother.

98
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,903
Supposed to be an architect.

99
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,243
So...

100
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,579
When did you first notice me?

101
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,792
I don't know.

102
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,002
"History of film", I guess.

103
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,671
The way you talked, you know?

104
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,882
Turned around
to see who you were.

105
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:26,009
And?

106
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:28,261
Nothing.

107
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,430
What?

108
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:31,515
Say it!

109
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:32,599
No, no, no!

110
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:33,558
Leave me alone!

111
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,185
I'm not gonna stop
until you say it.

112
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,770
Okay, okay, wait.

113
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,480
I thought you
were cute, alright?

114
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:39,815
Ahh...

115
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,942
I knew it.

116
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:56,123
Ah, hello?

117
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,418
I'm sorry.

118
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,295
I just don't know
where else to go.

119
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:10,595
You guys hanging out?

120
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:11,888
We were.

121
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:16,726
You okay?

122
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:18,103
I went over...

123
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:20,730
To see that movie
over at the student union.

124
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,192
Old, like, horror film
or something, "Freaks".

125
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,944
Tod Browning, 1932.

126
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:29,448
All these horrible people in it
with pointy heads and stuff.

127
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,616
This one guy had no legs.

128
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:32,993
He just hopped around
on his hands.

129
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:33,994
Caitlin...

130
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:35,579
We talked about this.

131
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,789
You can't keep exposing yourself
to things that upset you.

132
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,124
I know, it's just...

133
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,127
Why is other people's pain
a source of amusement?

134
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,091
Caitlin, what the hell
are you doing?

135
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,384
It's just a habit.

136
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,387
Well, stop it, alright?
You're gonna be bald.

137
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,222
It's obsessive compulsive.

138
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:56,892
I'm gonna head upstairs.

139
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,477
Don't go on account of me.

140
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,604
I have that
Poly-Sci paper anyway.

141
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:14,409
Please, don't be mad.

142
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,827
I'm not mad.

143
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:19,080
It's just you're
really moody, you know?

144
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,793
I think I miss my ferrets.

145
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:25,837
You gotta snap out
of this, Caitlin.

146
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,381
Maybe you need to
talk to somebody.

147
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,550
Yeah, well, I'm already
taking those buspar pills.

148
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,219
Well, maybe that's not enough.

149
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,140
Where are you going?

150
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,934
To the library.

151
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,618
See you later.

152
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,914
I'm sure coming here has been
a culture shock for her.

153
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:05,252
I mean, for us,
L.A., New Jersey,

154
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:08,004
We're kind of used to
the mean streets, you know?

155
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:12,592
Someone like Caitlin
from Bartlesville, Oklahoma...

156
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,345
New York's probably a little

157
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,055
Overwhelming.

158
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,559
Maybe we should try
and be patient with her.

159
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,355
What?

160
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,315
Nothing.

161
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,401
You're sweet.

162
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,571
Most guys wouldn't
even give a shit.

163
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,739
Well...

164
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,242
I'm not most guys.

165
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,932
Do you have a condom?

166
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,102
Are you okay?

167
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:49,731
Yeah.

168
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,966
A.J., call
Lindsey Blundetto.

169
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:18,760
Hi.

170
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,845
Hey, what are you doing home?
Don't you have class?

171
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,431
It's Friday,
only in the mornings.

172
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,811
I got a postcard
from the dentist.

173
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,354
It's time to
schedule a cleaning.

174
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,772
God, I just went.

175
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,857
Smells great, what is that?

176
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,235
It's a bundt cake
for A.J.'s fund raiser.

177
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:36,986
Nice shoes.

178
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,655
Is daddy home?

179
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:40,699
He's upstairs.

180
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,284
What's with you, you seem...

181
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,452
What?

182
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,121
Nothing, I don't know.

183
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,373
Hey, you know what I read?

184
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:49,708
They're making

That kid who kept
calling her Heloise

189
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:58,675
And I almost got
in a fight with her?

190
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,093
Yes, that little Spanish girl.

191
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,594
She was so annoying.

her family, the poor thing.

00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:18,906
What am I looking at?

369
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:21,033
My teeth, I got braces.

370
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,660
What do you want, a parade?

371
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:23,703
Oh!

372
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:25,329
What did I tell you
about fraternizing?

373
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,415
I'm not, I was just
showing Tony my braces.

374
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:28,374
Yeah?

375
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,126
I didn't shell out
three crackers

376
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,044
For you to be
modeling your teeth.

377
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,337
Get to work.

378
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,339
C'mon.

379
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,258
Anything else?

380
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,350
Ralphie's the one sticking her,

381
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,102
Why don't he pay for her teeth?

382
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,812
It's a loan, I'm juicing her.

383
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,440
Usually it's fake tits
they want.

384
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,234
Yeah, well, she don't
need those, that's for sure.

385
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,695
That kid's a thoroughbred.

386
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,614
But, Madonn', those choppers.

387
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,533
A fucking train wreck.

388
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:14,545
Well, Happy Birthday to us all.

389
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,589
That was a barrel of monkeys.

390
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,424
That guy Jeff
kept staring at me.

391
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,634
What do you think?

392
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,052
You want to check out "smokes"?

393
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,095
I'm a little tired, you know?

394
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,764
Yeah, yeah, right.

395
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,474
It is getting a little late.

396
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,601
Oh, my god.

397
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:31,437
That is so sad.

398
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:33,397
The chairs,
the pears, the bears,

399
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,149
The social security cards.

400
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:36,859
C'mon, Caitlin.

401
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,278
We should give her some money.

402
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:41,822
Caitlin!

403
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,366
Excuse me, miss.

404
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,575
Miss!

405
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:46,994
Miss!

406
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,706
Oh, my god!

407
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,001
Not bad, chrissy.

408
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:55,211
Decent week.

409
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:56,420
Not bad?

410
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:57,672
I'm running ragged here.

411
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,257
If I wanted to work
18 hours a day,

412
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,675
I could get a job at Denny's.

413
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:03,970
Like they'd fucking hire him.

414
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,722
What, are you crying?

415
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,140
Keep it up...

416
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,142
I'll give you
something to cry about.

417
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,317
Watch the braces, honey.

418
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:24,991
God, it was so horrible.

419
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,993
It's over, Caitlin, okay?

420
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,287
How can you be so callous?

421
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:32,456
That was the most
horrific thing ever.

422
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:35,751
It was a homeless woman with
"The Daily News" up her butt.

423
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:41,299
Every time I close my eyes,
I just keep seeing her.

424
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,175
Oh, my god.

425
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,511
Caitlin, why don't we go over
to the health center?

426
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:46,721
They'll help you.

427
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:48,431
They'll give you something
to calm down at least.

428
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:49,390
No.

429
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,851
No more drugs.

430
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:56,188
Caitlin, don't start
drinking, c'mon.

431
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:01,569
Listen...

432
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,946
I have to get up
really early tomorrow.

433
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:06,365
Josh is on the red eye
from L.A. and...

434
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:09,452
My friend, Josh, from Crossroads
High School, I didn't tell you?

435
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:10,828
No.

436
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:13,164
Sorry, I thought I did.

437
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,416
Anyway, he's coming in
and we're gonna head up

438
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:17,251
and see his brother
at Hampshire.

439
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:22,673
Try and get some rest, okay?

440
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,938
Where do you think
she sleeps at night?

441
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:43,110
(KNOCKING)

442
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:46,781
Hi.

443
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,617
When did you come in?

444
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,035
Just now.

445
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:53,746
Sorry, were you sleeping?

446
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:04,215
It's a good thing we're
paying for that dorm room.

447
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,425
It's Caitlin again,
I can't sleep there.

448
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,552
Forget about studying.

449
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:11,597
Like you were studying
at two A.M.

450
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,475
Noah and I took her
out for her birthday.

451
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:15,935
She's all depressed
to begin with

452
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,395
and then she starts
having conniptions

453
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:20,564
over this homeless lady
in the street.

454
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,488
And how are things with Noah?

455
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:32,493
He's going up to Hampshire
College with his friend from L.A.

456
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:35,371
He said he told me about it,
but I know he didn't.

457
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,873
Don't you think that's weird
that he would just do that?

458
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,000
I don't know,
I don't really know him.

459
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:41,669
And his friend, Josh, I mean...

460
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,421
I guess he's okay.

461
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:46,090
So, you two are
still dating then?

462
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,425
Is that a problem?

463
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:51,178
You started this conversation.

464
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,142
The hygienist from
Dr. Maceras called.

465
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,810
You never scheduled
your appointment.

466
00:23:57,894 --> 00:24:00,187
I'm sorry, I forgot, I'll do it.

467
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:05,276
And Jackie JR.
says hello.

468
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:11,407
Noah's great, but he can
be odd, you know?

469
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:12,575
It's like...

470
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:14,869
One minute he's all affectionate
and then the next,

471
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:17,079
he's like a totally
different person.

472
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,879
Meadow, are you in love
with this boy?

473
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:27,673
I don't know.

474
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,259
I guess so.

475
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:34,096
At this point, I better be.

476
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,766
At what point,
what does that mean?

477
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:41,312
Sorry, but we are so not
having that conversation.

478
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,877
Tony?

479
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,587
You have a second?

480
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,882
I know you said
we can't be friends,

481
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:11,967
But there's no one else
I can talk to.

482
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:16,805
I'm pregnant.

483
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:18,641
It's Ralphie's.

484
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:20,643
Congratulations.

485
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,066
I don't know what to do.

486
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,734
He acts like
he doesn't give a shit.

487
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:30,528
Did you ever think
he's not acting?

488
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:32,279
Well, what should I do,
should I keep it?

489
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,365
I don't get involved
in affairs of the heart.

490
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:36,158
But if I have it...

491
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,035
You think he'll
help me support it?

492
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:40,454
Oh, sure, it'll be
father knows best over there.

493
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,586
Look, you want my advice?

494
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,340
You already got one kid.

495
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:53,717
Problems with that,
burning him with cigarettes,

496
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,135
Whatever the fuck
you were doing.

497
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,845
I got help for that,
I had a lot of repressed anger.

498
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,806
The county social worker
says it all goes back

499
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,849
To my mom and holding
my hand on the stove...

500
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,351
Whatever, okay?

501
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:04,937
Your age, your situation,

502
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:07,898
You need another kid like you
need a fucking hole in the head.

503
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:11,110
You're young, still got your
figure, you're making money.

504
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,445
So, you think I should
get an abortion?

505
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,906
Believe me,
with Ralphie as the father,

506
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,993
You'll be doing this kid and the next
three generations a favor.

507
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:27,585
Hey, Urban Outfitters
is having a sale.

508
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:29,628
We're out of syrup.

509
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,463
'Cause you use a whole
gallon at a time.

510
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:32,131
Shut up.

511
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:32,840
A.J.

512
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:33,716
You wanna go?

513
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,925
What do you need, shoes?

514
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,218
Shoes, some new tops.

515
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:37,386
I need underwear.

516
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:38,596
So, you wanna go or not?

517
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,306
I put your whites
in at 10:30.

518
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:41,807
I need to wait until
the dryer's free.

519
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,058
Let Lilliana do it.

520
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:43,892
Lilliana's off.

521
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,978
It's gonna be a zoo
by the time we get there.

523
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:08,917
Meadow here?

524
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,961
She paged me,
she's at her parents.

525
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,254
Oh.

526
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:14,882
Want to hang out?

527
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,967
I'm writing my paper.

528
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:19,261
You mind if I just
sit and study then?

529
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,805
I'm fine, really, it's just...

530
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:24,475
You know, it's creepy
up there alone.

531
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,894
Um...

532
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:29,438
Alright.

533
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,532
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

534
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,125
What are we, short?

535
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:51,585
Who we missing?

536
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:53,087
Tracee.

537
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,923
Left sick on Saturday,
haven't seen her since.

538
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,633
For three days?!

539
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,927
Fucking twat.

540
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:20,823
I talked to my mom.

541
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,450
And she wants me to go
to Vermont this weekend.

542
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,410
For what?

543
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:25,994
Friends of my dad's.

544
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,788
Paul and Irione Dudley.

545
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,999
Paul's a psychiatry professor
at Dartmouth Medical School

546
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:34,044
And they have a horse farm
and ride and talk.

547
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:36,463
Paul's very inspiring.

548
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:38,799
Sounds good.

549
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,219
I just feel better already.

550
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,722
Irione is an amazing cook.

551
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,932
Now, if I just don't
get freaked out

552
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:48,809
By the sound of
the pine trees at night.

553
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,602
I'm going to Noah's.

554
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,986
This Moltisanti kid,
he's got his head up his ass.

555
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:03,407
This is a great gladiator movie?

556
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,326
Look at Kirk Douglas'
fucking hair.

557
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:10,038
They didn't have flat tops
in ancient Rome!

558
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:13,333
What do you want to drink, baby?

559
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,918
Get me a Fresca.

560
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:24,094
C-fucking-minus
and it's all her fault.

561
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:27,306
You know, six hours I'm trying
to work and she just won't stop.

562
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,474
Tell me about it.

563
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:29,683
The questions, the whining,

564
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,226
the crazy goddamn nonsense.

565
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:33,896
She starts crying about
her economics class.

566
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,648
She doesn't get it, so I give her
my notes from last year.

567
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:39,568
I'm talking primo notes,
I got an "a".

568
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:41,069
But even that's a problem.

569
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,571
She doesn't understand
my writing.

570
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:45,324
"What does this word mean?
Blah, blah, blah, blah."

571
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:47,409
Nothing's ever enough with her.

572
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,994
I mean, I know
I'm the R.A.

573
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,955
But technically she's not
even on my floor.

574
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,416
C-minus.

575
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,252
Really beautiful, Noah.

576
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,129
It's not that bad, okay?

577
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,884
I want options when
I graduate, meadow.

578
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,261
I'm going to law school
in two short years.

579
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,514
A c-minus is fucked for me.

580
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:13,393
It's early in the semester,
you'll make it up.

581
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:31,662
Is that alright, honey?

582
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,247
Fine.

583
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:39,211
You know I take
care of you, right?

584
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,797
You, Danny,

585
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:43,590
Our gorgeous little baby.

586
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:44,716
(KNOCKING)

587
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,009
Who's that?

588
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,262
How the fuck should I know?

589
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,055
Ralphie, open up!

590
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,767
Ah, shit.

591
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,561
(POUNDING ON DOOR)

592
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,272
Ralphie!

593
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:07,865
Where's tracee?

594
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,408
She's busy.

595
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:10,993
Hey, Sill.

596
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,286
Put your shoes on!

597
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,954
Oh, what'd I say?

598
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:15,873
I don't know,
what'd you fuckin' say?

599
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:18,000
Three days she missed work.

600
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,377
I've been sick, Sil.

601
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,545
Oh, yeah?

602
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:23,130
I called your house.

603
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:25,591
Your mother says you haven't
been there for two days either.

604
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:27,551
I was here,
Ralph's taking care of me.

605
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,887
You got a little kid at home!

606
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:32,264
Her mother's watching him!

607
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,182
Mind your fucking
business, Ralph!

608
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:35,726
Oh, where do you get
the balls to come here?

609
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,352
Three grand this cunt's into me,

610
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:40,606
And where do I get
my fucking balls?!

611
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,944
Go on, get out of here.

612
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:48,030
Let's go!

613
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,662
What's the matter
with you, huh?!

614
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,581
You know how many
girls would kill

615
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:58,874
for the opportunity you've got?

616
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,167
What, working for you?

617
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,627
Oh, go ahead, keep it up.

618
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:02,794
Give me a break,

619
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:05,255
In two seconds I could
get a job at any other...

620
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:07,466
Listen to me,
you little boochiac'.

621
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:09,343
Until you pay what you owe,

622
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,345
that shaved twat of yours
belongs to me!

623
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,721
You understand?!

624
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:15,557
I asked you a question.

625
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:18,143
Yeah, now, get in the car.

626
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:26,985
(LAUGHING)

627
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:31,365
And then I go to pour the milk
and the carton is empty.

628
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:34,284
I keep telling you,
it's not me, it's A.J.

629
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:35,410
Nice try, mister.

630
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:36,954
How about the football trance?

631
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,373
I swear to god, we can have
an entire conversation,

632
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,292
But if that TV's on, he's not
hearing a word I'm saying.

633
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:43,752
One time this happened.

634
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,253
Forget it, gab,

635
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,922
You might as well be
talkin' to the furniture.

636
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,633
Well, that's because men have
the attention span of children.

637
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,468
Sorry, honey, what'd you say?

638
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:55,555
This cake, Rosalie.

639
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:57,516
Really, Ro, delicious.

640
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:58,684
The whole meal.

641
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:01,269
I'm glad we could reciprocate.

642
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,650
Hey, college boy, how's school?

643
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:08,068
Good, you know.

644
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:09,820
Crackin' the books.

645
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,238
Almost dean's list.

646
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:12,656
What's this, almost?

647
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,033
Give me his name,
no more almost.

648
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,036
I'm going out.

649
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:19,705
I'll probably end up
staying at Bobby's.

650
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,081
No drinking and driving.

651
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:22,791
C'mon, he knows
better than that.

652
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,084
Right, tough guy?

653
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,794
Yeah, whatever you say, Ralph.

654
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:27,045
Get lost.

655
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,755
Enjoy your youth.

656
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:31,425
I'm gonna kill you.

657
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:33,719
Why didn't you tell me
this place was so fancy?

658
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:36,013
Calm down, it's just my father.

659
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:38,640
Believe me, it'll be nothing
compared to meeting your dad.

660
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:43,687
There he is.

661
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:44,646
Hey.

662
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:47,315
Hey, dad.

663
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,568
Meadow.

664
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:50,902
This is my father, Len.

665
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:51,695
Hello.

666
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,905
Len Tannenbaum, please sit.

667
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:57,784
How was the flight?

668
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:01,705
Aside from Tim Daly
chewing my ear for an hour,

669
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:02,748
It was wonderful.

670
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,666
The guy from "wings",
you know him?

671
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,293
He did his deal for "fugitive".

672
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,295
Usually I enjoy
L.A. to New York.

673
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:09,838
Five hours
without interruptions,

674
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:11,965
It's the only time I get
to do some real work.

675
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:13,216
Unbelievable.

676
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:14,509
He flies first class,

677
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:16,803
personal DVD player
with any movie he wants

678
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:18,305
Never even opens the case.

679
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:19,765
Bad enough representing
these people,

680
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:22,601
I have to suffer
through their movies too?

681
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:27,022
God, it must be so exciting
being an entertainment lawyer.

682
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,982
Get to meet all the celebrities.

683
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,984
It beats working for a living.

684
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,778
He's in town to
meet with Dick Wolf.

685
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:34,071
The sportscaster?

686
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,989
Actually, he's a TV producer.

687
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:38,075
"Special Victims Unit,
Law and Order".

688
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,201
"New York Undercover".

689
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:40,786
I used to love that show.

690
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,121
Good evening, may I offer you
a cocktail before dinner?

691
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:45,332
Guys, are we drinking wine?

692
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:50,587
Clos Pegase, the '94
if you've got.

693
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:58,595
So, meadow, what business
is your father in?

694
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:03,141
Actually, um,
he's in waste management.

695
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,977
Ah, toxic chemicals,
medical waste,

696
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,312
that sort of thing?

697
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:10,190
Yeah, sort of,
environmental cleanup.

698
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:21,368
Let's give a Big Bada Bing
welcome to Tracee.

699
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,474
Hey, that guy cut the line.

700
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,023
What's the matter?

701
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:55,527
I told Caitlin if we went
to the movies I'd call her.

702
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:58,155
I'm starting to feel bad.

703
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:00,615
I stopped feeling bad
the second I saw that grade.

704
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:04,828
Did I tell you my father's filing a
restraining order against her?

705
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,413
What?

706
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:10,167
You're kidding, right?

707
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,085
You obviously
don't know my father.

708
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:15,630
He totally freaked when
he heard about the C-minus.

709
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,508
Well, I mean...

710
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,553
Couldn't you try
talking to her first?

711
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:23,388
At this point?

712
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:26,391
She thinks we're her friends.

713
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:27,976
Well, you have to set limits.

714
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,561
The girl was ruining our lives.

715
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:32,314
Think about it, we couldn't do
anything without her horning in.

716
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:36,109
We certainly couldn't
take her to see this.

717
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:51,708
Mrs. Custer
grabs the artist,

718
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:52,459
"Oh!

719
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,878
"I tell you I want a painting

720
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:57,172
"Commemorating my husband's
last thoughts,

721
00:36:57,298 --> 00:37:01,134
You give me cows with halos
and Indians making love?"

722
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:03,803
"Mrs. Custer,"
he says.

723
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:07,682
"Those are your husband's
last thoughts."

724
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:11,061
"Holy cow,

725
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,898
look at all
those fucking Indians."

726
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:16,650
(LAUGHING)

727
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:21,780
Oh, what, not even a hello?

728
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:23,698
Fuck you, asshole.

729
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:26,368
Oh, that's nice, very nice.

730
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:29,329
That's how you talk to a man
in front of his friends?

731
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:30,497
Yeah, right.

732
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,165
What man?

733
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,541
Oh, a double.

734
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:35,669
You tell him, sweetie.

735
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:37,462
I like this girl!

736
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,548
Women, women, women.

737
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:44,886
Why was I born handsome
instead of rich?

738
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:46,680
(DOOR CLOSING)

739
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:57,899
Leave me alone.

740
00:37:58,025 --> 00:37:59,484
What's the matter with you?

741
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,569
What are you being
like this for?

742
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,697
Fuck you, three days you don't
call even to see how I am.

743
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:06,074
Baby, I'm busy, I gotta work.

744
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:08,493
How else am I gonna
take care of you

745
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,787
when you're
nine months pregnant?

746
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:13,915
You serious?

747
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,293
Of course I'm serious.

748
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:22,465
We'll get a little house...

749
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:25,427
In a cul-de-sac.

750
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:28,263
I know that guy
who's a mortgage broker.

751
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:29,889
Really?

752
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:34,477
Ralphie, I love you.

753
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,855
I love you too, baby.

754
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:39,107
Hey...

755
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:42,068
If it's a boy...

756
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:45,030
We'll name him after me.

757
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:49,367
If it's a girl, we'll name it
Tracee after you.

758
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,787
This way she can grow up
to be a cock sucking slob

759
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:54,372
just like her mother.

760
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:58,710
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

761
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:03,340
Guinea motherfucking
piece of shit!

762
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,342
That's right, that's right,
get it all out.

763
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:07,344
Get it all out,
you little whore.

764
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,276
That make you feel good?

765
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:25,612
You feel like a man?

766
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,524
Look at you now.

767
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,001
Oh...

768
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,422
Give me a fucking drink.

769
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,590
What happened to you?

770
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:31,219
Tracee.

771
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:33,096
She slipped.

772
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:36,057
We were arguing, I don't know.

773
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,143
She fell.

774
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:49,362
Holy fucking shit.

775
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:53,491
Get a sheet, Chrissy,
cover that up.

776
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,205
Where is he?

777
00:40:59,290 --> 00:40:59,998
Inside.

778
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:01,458
Go get him.

779
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,434
She fell?

780
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,727
That's my story.

781
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,061
You stupid motherfucker!

782
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,438
How fucking dare you!

783
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:24,856
Take it easy.

784
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:25,940
You don't think.

785
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,400
You disrespect this place.

786
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,737
That's the reason why
you were passed the fuck over.

787
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,864
It's my fault she's a klutz?

788
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:43,750
Motherfucker!

789
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:47,253
Are you out of your fucking mind
layin' your hands on me?!

790
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:48,588
He's the boss of this family!

791
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:49,964
Shut the fuck up!

792
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,175
I'm a made guy!

793
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:56,346
Ton', we gotta
get you out of here.

794
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:57,889
Is this place open?

795
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,015
No!

796
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:01,476
Get the fuck out of here, Ralph!

797
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,899
Keep that back door locked!

798
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:09,734
And get her the fuck
out of here.

799
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:12,278
You got a rug,
a piece of carpet?

800
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:15,698
Cocksucker was way out of line.

801
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:19,035
20 years old, this girl.

802
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,621
That too.

803
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,335
Let's go.

804
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:58,157
What?

805
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:01,995
I think we need to talk.

806
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:07,959
I think that maybe we've been
seeing too much of each other.

807
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,044
And?

808
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:12,672
I don't know.

809
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:14,424
I mean...

810
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,721
I really like you, meadow.

811
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:23,516
It's just...

812
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:28,521
I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

813
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:32,483
Are you breaking up with me?

814
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:34,569
Are you really that surprised?

815
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:37,614
Why, I mean...

816
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:40,491
Things were going so good.

817
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:42,076
Look, honestly,

818
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:44,287
You're too negative.

819
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,706
It's like you have
this underlying cynicism

820
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:47,540
about everything.

821
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:49,584
What are you talking about?

822
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:52,879
I really didn't
want to get into this.

823
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:12,940
So...

824
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:15,026
Things are better then?

825
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:17,654
Since our first session?

826
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:27,372
Yes, I guess.

827
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:30,500
We seem to talk more easily.

828
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:40,093
Sometimes even painful sessions
can break the log jam.

829
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,012
Yes.

830
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:48,267
And then this.

831
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:51,854
You're being
particularly quiet today.

832
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:54,440
Sometimes I got nothing to say.

833
00:44:57,903 --> 00:44:59,362
Anthony.

834
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:01,072
Carmela is here.

835
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:05,785
She's giving up her time to
talk about your panic attacks.

836
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,583
A young man who...

837
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:17,046
Worked for us...

838
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:20,091
Baronet sanitation, he...

839
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:23,261
He died.

840
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:24,554
Who?

841
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,013
Who?

842
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:28,349
You don't know him.

843
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:33,938
He died, that's all.

844
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,527
Work-related death.

845
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:47,952
It's sad when they go so young.

846
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:12,852
How was the dentist?

847
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:29,160
God, is there nothing
to eat in this house?!

848
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:50,181
Who knows, maybe she quit.

849
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:53,518
I heard she went outside with
Ralphie and never came back.

850
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:56,062
Do yourself a favor,
keep what you hear to yourself.

851
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:57,855
Parties are usually
Friday night.

852
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:00,107
A lot of high rollers,
a lot of big tips.

853
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:01,818
You want in the VIP room?

854
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:04,654
It's 50 bucks to me
plus a blow job later on.

855
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:11,035
