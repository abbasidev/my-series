00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:37,691
- You're letting her off.
- My uncle denies it.

343
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:40,319
- He loves you.
- I know that!

344
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:44,782
Grown children often wish
for an aged parent to die.

345
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:49,119
It's not necessary for the parent
to testify against them.

346
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:52,414
It's a taboo thought, but common.

347
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:59,421
Particularly if the parent has lost
all capacity for joy at being alive.

348
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:10,641
So we're probably done here, right?

349
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,643
She's dead.

350
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:21,985
- What is it?
- Tony's mother's wake is tonight.

351
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:26,114
Want me to wear a wire?

352
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:30,828
Sure. Need batteries?
Let's go to Office Depot.

I'm downstairs.

356
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,890
- Hi.
- Hey.

357
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:56,311
- Mom would want a closed casket.
- Definitely.

358
00:30:56,521 --> 00:31:01,066
They usually put a picture on the casket.
What do you think?

359
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:03,527
- Look at that.
- She's smiling.

360
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:07,030
She looks normal.

361
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:10,784
- It was us kids who turned her.
- One of us.

362
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:14,204
Get the fuck off!

363
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:16,707
All right, all right!

364
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:26,216
Maybe you're right.

365
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:30,554
My shrink says all women
aren't cut out to be mothers.

366
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:33,098
- Is that a slam at me?
- No.

367
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:39,813
If my father was in the circus,
maybe I'd turn out like Harp...

369
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:43,233
- This is weird.
- What?

370
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:47,195
None of my childhood artwork
is here anymore.

371
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,239
Nor Barb's.

372
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:52,576

is a good book."

376
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,927
What? Here's Barbara's
Communion certificate.

377
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:13,722
- Here's her baby shoe.
- Yeah. That's it.

379
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:28,445

"extraordinary visualization skills."

that I did of Grandpa?

00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:57,641

With the tantrums?

For this I miss the Jets game?

389
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:19,162
Did they say when your making ceremony
might happen, with this delay?

390
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:23,750
Stop asking fucking questions.
If I knew, I couldn't tell you.

Anything to get through these events.

394
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:19,765
- What a fucking blow.
- You too?

395
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,516
I'm serious.

of your house arrest?

Allow me to express my condolences.

Thanks, assemblyman.

404
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:54,382
I met your mom once or twice.
That was a proud Newarker.

406
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:02,224
My sympathies, Tony.
We talked about this day, did we not?

407
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:08,605
You know State Assemblyman
Zellman, right? 8th Ward?

Do I know him? You bet.

409
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,318
Yes, we go way back.
How are you?

They're dropping like fucking flies.

413

- It's that charcoal-broiled meat.
- Nobody told us!

I'm kidding, you fuck.
What's the matter?

415
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:39,803
- You wanted to talk?
- I gotta talk to your wife.

416
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:41,346

417
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:45,100

- To use this sad occasion...

420
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:03,410
...to put bitterness and
sore-headed feelings aside.

421
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:08,540
I'll behave how Tony wants.
I don't want to add to his stress.

422
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:12,085
- There they are.
- Hi, Uncle Jun.

Ralphie Cifaretto got word to me.

426

- What does he want?
- A bump up to captain.

427
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:49,122
The kid's been a top earner since
that rat bastard went in the program.

428
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:52,167
He whipped his crew into shape.

429
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:56,296
Three months ago, the rat bastard
was the second coming.

431
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:00,508
I forget nothing.

432
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:05,430
- Don't make me say things we'd regret.
- Go ahead, I'm fed up.

513
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:03,181
Form a circle,
sit anywhere, get comfortable...

514
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:07,685
...so that we can all be together
and share a remembrance...

515
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:10,647
...about the woman
who brought us here.

516
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:13,316
- Goddamn it.
- Please, join us.

517
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:18,321
Paulie Gualtieri? Join us, please?

518
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:22,950
Thank you.

519
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:28,373
What the fuck did I say?

520
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:33,920
If you'd rather,
I can invite them to her place.

521
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:38,591
- Janice, what are you doing?
- Very good.

522
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:42,053
We can all take a break from eating
for five minutes.

523
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:48,017
Most of you will probably remember
that this was her favorite song.

524
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:51,396
It might help us get rolling.

525
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:53,272
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

526
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:39,444
(SHUTS OFF MUSIC)

527
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,792
Herman Rabkin?

528
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:04,051
You two went back.
Almost to the pyramids.

529
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:06,804
I...

530
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:11,768
I guess what struck me most was...

531
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:14,562
...she didn't mince words.

532
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:26,532
Between brain and mouth,
there was no interlocutor.

533
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,213
Anthony Jr.

534
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:45,343
- I don't know what to say.
- Come on.

535
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:47,595
Lay off, Janice. Move on.

536
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:52,350
She was my best friend.

537
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:03,152
If anybody died
or was in the hospital...

538
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:07,824
...I'd get a call from Li
letting me know.

539
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:19,377
Thank you, Fanny. Thank you.

540
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:29,887
Okay. What's good for the goose...

541
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:37,603
Most of you remember that I have
an extraordinary visual sense.

542
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:43,484
As a child, Mom didn't let me
rest on those laurels.

543
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:46,529
She didn't flatter me.

544
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:54,328
She believed that wildflowers
blossom best...

545
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:58,541
...among the rocks, with little water.

546
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:00,960
She was tough.

547
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,839
But she was right.

548
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:10,344
She's the reason I make videos today.

549
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:20,187
Tony?

550
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:25,067
Maybe you'd like
to tell them how Ma...

551
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:30,823
...saved all your childhood schoolwork
and none of mine or Barbara's.

552
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:36,787
You just did. Wrap it up, Janice.

553
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:48,090
I hear she didn't suffer.

554
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:51,302
For that, we can be grateful.

555
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:53,846
Thank you.

556
00:48:57,768 --> 00:49:03,439
They say there's no two people
on Earth exactly the same.

557
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:09,153
No two faces,
no two sets of fingerprints.

558
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:12,406
But do they know for sure?

559
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:18,245
Because they would have to get
everybody together in one huge space.

560
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:22,708
Obviously, that's not possible,
even with computers.

561
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:29,465
They'd have to get everyone who
ever lived, not just the ones now.

562
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:32,677
So they got no proof.
They got nothing.

563
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:46,899
Hey.

564
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:54,532
- So, Ton, she's dead.
- What?

565
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:00,162
I guess our little secret...

566
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:04,125
...dies with her.

567
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,932
Hey, pick that up!

568
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:23,185
What am I doing out here?

569
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:27,648
Everyone's telling stories of her.
I got a beaut!

570
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:28,983
Artie.

571
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:34,780
Artie! Don't talk about that!

572
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:41,120
She may have passed, but who's to say
there's not another just like her?

573
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:46,333
Maybe not with the same fears
and paranoia, but...

574
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:48,044
...the same.

575
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:54,091
What I'm saying is...

576
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:05,352
Thank you, Chris. Thank you.

577
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:14,653
Umm...

578
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:20,743
- This is such a crock of shit.
- Carmela!

579
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:25,414
On one hand, I want to protect
my children from the truth.

580
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:30,419
On the other, I'm saying,
"What kind of example am I setting?"

581
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:34,757
Evading and smiling,
passing out cheese puffs.

582
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:38,385
Over a woman who was
terribly dysfunctional.

583
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:41,597
Who spread no cheer at all.

584
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:44,517
- Carmela, be quiet.
- This is my house!

585
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:47,269
- I'm leaving.
- Let her talk!

586
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:50,064
I'll speak if I want! Who are you?

587
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:52,775
Minister of Propaganda?

588
00:51:53,151 --> 00:51:56,529
We suffered for years
under the yoke of that woman.

589
00:51:57,447 --> 00:52:00,282
She estranged us
from our own daughter.

590
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:04,453
Ruined I don't know how many
goddamned Christmases.

591
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:08,582
No, don't hand me that! Bullshit!

592
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:12,128
You wanted it, you got it.

593
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:14,964
Hear, hear.

594
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:20,427
From beyond the grave even.

595
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:24,807
This woman didn't want a funeral.

596
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:29,186
You all, her children,
ignored her wishes.

597
00:52:29,437 --> 00:52:32,064
Only after she's dead, by the way.

598
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:39,613
She didn't want a funeral.
She didn't want a remembrance.

599
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:40,823
Why?

600
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,493
She didn't think anybody would come!

601
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:51,709
She wouldn't write down
her memories...

602
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,920
...because nobody loved her
enough to read them.

603
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:59,884
She knew there was a problem.

604
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:18,110
There's desserts...

605
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:21,906
...in the dining room,
if anybody wants some.

606
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:24,867
Yes.

607
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:29,538
And they're all from Vesuvio.

608
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:35,169
Our new pastry chef, Bobby Vasquez.
Thanks.

609
00:53:42,677 --> 00:53:46,222
Tommy? Mike's here.

610
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:48,891
He's come to see you.

611
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:53,062
You must like Mike
a lot better than me.

612
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:56,732
No, Tommy boy. You're my baby.

613
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,693
You're going to get well and strong.

614
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:03,030
All of us. Together again.

615
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:07,243
I'm almost glad this happened.

616
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:16,919
(PHONE)

617
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:21,757
Yeah? This is Mike.

618
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:23,884
When?

619
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:27,096
You are? Fine.

620
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:29,598
- They're bringing Tom home.
- When?

621
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:32,935
- Right now. He's on his way.
- Wonderful!

622
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:37,648
I'll get his room ready.
I knew my baby would come home.

623
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:40,234
(HUMMING)

624
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:25,321
