1
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:43,435
MAN: a guy that really understands
you people. And that really frightens me.

2
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:47,106
Hey, while there have been some turnover
in the elite teams of last year...

3
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:50,109
...one thing remains consistent,
the Eagles.

4
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,486
The Cowboys have remained
fairly healthy this year...

5
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,862
(BEEPER)

6
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:57,574
- Come on, don't answer it. You just got in.
- I have to. It's football season.

7
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:01,328
Oh, come on. There is no game tonight.

8
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,039
- Paulie, what's up?
- Forget that betting.

9
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:08,377
- I was making cheese dogs for you.
- Why, what's going on?

10
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,462
Okay.

11
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,131
All right.

12
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,924
I'll be there.

13
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,926
Chrissy!

14
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,722
Plus it was a bitch
getting off of work tonight.

15
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:25,018
- Adriana, I think this could be it.
- What?

16
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:28,480
He told me to look sharp and
meet him at Modell's in half an hour.

17
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,691
He told me to shine my shoes.

18
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:35,237
Oh, my God. Christopher!

19
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:40,659
Find me a shirt and tie to go with this. Not
the camellia. Paulie's got one just like it.

20
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:45,205
I can't believe it. I mean,
I knew it would happen, but...

21
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:49,543
So now can we get out of here, you know?
Get a big loft, maybe?

22
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:53,630
- You're giving notice today.
- You wish.

23
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,554
The wife of a made guy doesn't hostess.

24
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:03,765
I'm so proud of you.

25
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:07,436
- I love you, Christopher.
- You better.

26
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:22,993
- What?
- I don't know.

27
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:29,833
You getting called like this and
going off all happy. I worry, that's all.

28
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:32,920
You've seen too many movies.

29
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:49,937
- How you doing, kid?
- Good.

30
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,689
No, no, no. Ride up front.

31
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,150
Where we going?

32
00:03:56,486 --> 00:04:00,239
You look good. Shoot your cuffs.

33
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,249
Where we going, Sil?

34
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,253
Here he is.

35
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,258
So this is it.

36
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,593
All right.

37
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:26,848
He sat on one ass cheek
the whole way over!

38
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:31,311
- Too many fucking movies, that's his problem.
- Bullshit, I sat funny.

39
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:36,400
All right. Let's get started. Come on.

40
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:44,741
PAULIE: All right, finish up over there.

41
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,702
TONY: All right, you know
why we're here.

42
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:50,497
So if you've got any doubts or
reservations, now's the time to say so.

43
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,250
No one will think any less of you.

44
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:58,505
Because once you enter this family,
there's no getting out.

45
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:02,384
This family comes before
everything else. Everything.

46
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:07,597
Before your wife, and your children,
and your mother and your father.

47
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,975
It's a thing of honor.

48
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:13,312
And God forbid, if something happens
and you can't earn...

49
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,231
...we'll take care of you,
because that's part of it.

50
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:20,319
If you got a problem,
you just gotta let somebody know.

51
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:23,864
This man right here,
he's like your father.

52
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:30,037
It doesn't matter if it's with
somebody here or on the outside...

53
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,374
...you bring it to him, he'll solve it.

54
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:38,670
You stay within the family.

55
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:42,966
All right, give me your hand.

56
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,323
Okay.

57
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:10,285
That's St. Peter, my family saint.
Now, as that card burns...

58
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:14,956
...so may your soul burn in hell
if you betray your friends in the family.

59
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,963
Now rub your hands together like this
and repeat after me.

60
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:25,175
- May I burn in hell...
- May I burn in hell...

61
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:30,055
...if I betray my friends.
...if I betray my friends.

62
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,102
Congratulations.

63
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,241
Beautiful.

64
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:06,967
- My fucking heart's still pounding.
- You been doing good with the sports book.

65
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:11,805
- Yeah, it's been good.
- I'm gonna give it to you, my boy. It's yours.

66
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:16,309
- I was wondering what it was gonna be.
- You're a made guy now.

67
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:20,689
It's your turn to make some real money,
and I get to relax a little.

68
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:25,735
Your only problem in life now is you give me
10 points of your take every settle-up day.

69
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,655
Other than that, you got no problem.

70
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:34,286
My only problem in life? I gotta kick
my points to that man over there.

71
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,914
And onward goes this thing of ours.

72
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,460
When you think of all the headaches
most human beings have in life...

73
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:45,380
...ours are all boiled down to only one.
Not a bad deal, huh?

74
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,174
You got it.

75
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:50,677
Only thing, there's a six-G
minimum every week.

76
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:56,224
I gotta get something out of this. But six
grand, that could be a lot or a little.

77
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:59,895
Depends on you, and how
much you grow the business.

78
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:03,523
I love you, Paulie.
We're in it together now.

79
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,234
I love you too, kid.

80
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:14,159
Anything on the Riverfront
Esplanade project in Newark?

81
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:17,496
My guy says the matching funds
are this close.

82
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:22,501
The development agency, they added plans for
a Newark Museum of Science and Trucking.

83
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:25,879
More cement. More everything.

84
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:30,008
Answer the fucking thing.

85
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,345
So you feeling okay?

86
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:38,016
Oh, you mean about my mother?
Well, I mean, what're you gonna do?

87
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,728
- You pick up the pieces and go on.
- I meant your spells.

88
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,688
They're not spells.

89
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,107
How do you know about that in New York?

90
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:49,402
Everybody knows.
There's nothing to be ashamed of, Tony.

91
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:53,114
- For chrissakes, Julius Caesar was an epileptic.
- I'm not an epileptic.

92
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:57,202
Whatever it is, you gotta take care
of yourself. It's your health.

93
00:08:57,411 --> 00:09:00,121
- Is the psychiatrist helping?
- Oh, you know about that too.

94
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:02,749
So what?
There's no stigmata these days.

95
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:07,254
My kid saw a shrink. He got
court-ordered for that thing with his wife.

96
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:10,590
- They're very happy now.
- Whatever happened to privacy?

97
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:15,095
Our family's been doing our Jersey business
a long time with the Sopranos.

98
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:21,434
In a peaceful and profitable way. And I
wanna keep it like that. Take care of this.

99
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:25,939
- All right, Carmine.
- Why fuck around? Be a better friend to yourself.

100
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:29,609
I will.
I appreciate your concern. Really.

101
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,454
Jayne was determined to bust
into the business, so to speak.

102
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:45,417
Hollywood folklore has it that she
called Paramount Pictures and said:

103
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,587
"My name's Jayne Mansfield
and I wanna be a movie star."

104
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,423
Nowadays you get a dial tone.
But back in 1954...

105
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:55,302
You got a phone call
from some young kid.

106
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:59,973
- Drew. Asked when you were coming home.
- How'd he sound?

107
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:03,101
Like he was about 15 years old.

108
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:09,816
- Wait. Is that your so-called fiancé?
- He's 19, actually, and he can go all night.

109
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:15,280
When are you going back to Seattle,
Janice?

110
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:19,409
It depends on how long it takes
to settle Ma's estate.

111
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:26,666
Estate? A falling-down house
and some old-lady underwear.

112
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:31,838
- Sad, isn't it? What it all comes down to.
- Janice, you know how much we love you.

113
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,841
And you know how much
we love having you around.

114
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:40,305
But there's a whole big house over there.
And I know you want maximum value.

115
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:47,103
So maybe for security reasons, or so it don't
fall into disrepair, you could stay there.

116
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:51,775
I been thinking the same thing.
I just don't wanna push Svetlana out.

117
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:56,905
Yeah, well, I talked to her. She's
moving out tomorrow, maybe the next day.

118
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:59,699
- Really?
- Yeah.

119
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,951
Great.

120
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,749
I better go pack.

121
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:36,319
Jesus Christ. Let me come around.

122
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,905
How you doing, Roy?

123
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,367
Congratulations.

124
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:46,788
Hector, large Old Blue Eyes for this
gentleman. Soft drinks of choice.

125
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,790
Look.

126
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:56,923
- Take away Tony Soprano, he's a zero with shoes.
- He's wearing a stripe now.

127
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:00,760
- My uncle Richie was gonna...
- Yeah, but he never did.

128
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,441
- Chris. My propers.
- Dino.

129
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,776
Hey, Benny.

130
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,283
Congratulations.

131
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:27,787
- When'd you get out, Benny?
- D.A. tossed it. The witness bailed.

132
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:31,458
- So, Jackie, how's Rutgers?
- Fuck that. I'm dropping out.

133
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,793
Come on. "Boola Boola."

134
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:38,548
We were just talking about our former
alma mater. They got the coffeehouse.

135
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:42,469
It's a pure cash operation.
And the beauty part is...

136
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:47,015
...I mean, who's gonna stop you?
Kids? Campus security?

137
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:51,144
What are you telling him about that?
That's ours.

138
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:58,443
- Watch where the fuck you're going!
- Kiss my ass!

139
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:02,113
Take that shit outside!
Don't disrespect the pizza parlor.

140
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:06,367
- Fucking asshole! I know where you live!
- You hear what I said?

141
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:14,751
Yo, it was good talking to you, Chris.
Keep Dino in mind.

142
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:20,089
I don't wanna sound like an asshole, but I
can't be seen in a place like this anymore.

143
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,851
All right.

144
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:36,231
This has gotta start showing results
or end.

145
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,652
Now, I talked to a business associate,
a man I respect, about these panic attacks.

146
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:44,364
Enough fucking around.
Enough money in your pocket.

147
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:47,408
What's the story here?

148
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:53,289
The latest treatment of Panic Attack
Syndrome is a three-pronged approach.

149
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,624
So it's a syndrome?

150
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:58,211
Medication to treat the depression,
psychotherapy...

151
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,214
...and cognitive behavioral therapy.

152
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:02,966
We've got you on medication.

153
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:06,761
If you feel you're ready,
you could see a behaviorist.

154
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:12,642
- You mean talk to somebody else?
- You seem unhappy with my approach.

155
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:18,106
If you're really ready to commit
to mental health, I say great.

156
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:21,234
Let's get going, I'm ready to help.

157
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:25,321
But we'll have to delve deeper. Focus.

158
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:30,410
This latest incident, for starters.

159
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,497
All right. Fine.

160
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:41,045
My daughter brought home a black.

161
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:46,259
They were on the couch, watching TV.
Snuggling.

162
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,097
And?

163
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:57,812
And she went upstairs, and I had a
frank conversation with Buckwheat.

164
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,940
You know? I told him to stay the fuck
away from my daughter.

165
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:05,153
And she came downstairs and they left.

166
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,448
And then you had the attack?

167
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:15,288
Well, no, not right then. I went to the kitchen
to fix a sandwich, I opened the cabinet...

168
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:18,958
...I saw a box of Uncle Ben's rice.
Boom!

169
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,878
I see. The rice logo.

170
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:27,967
The first onset of hyperventilation,
that occurred upon seeing the rice?

171
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:36,267
No, no. I was taking the capocollo
and shit out of the fridge.

172
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:42,190
I'm thinking when you first came here,
the panic attack with ducks...

173
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,319
...as I remember it,
you were grilling meat, weren't you?

174
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,655
The memory on you.

175
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:52,992
- Sausages, wasn't it?
- Sausages. Steaks. Yeah.

176
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:57,664
Let's get back to that capocollo.

177
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:02,710
I gotta take that. My busy season.

178
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,381
Yeah?

179
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,591
Fifty?

180
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,511
That's pretty rich for one game.

181
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,514
All right. If he's good for it, take it.

182
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:18,101
But keep me posted on Duke-Wake Forest.

183
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,228
All right.

184
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,317
Sorry.

185
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:29,237
Where were we?

186
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:33,616
The connection between
your anxiety attacks and meat.

187
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,368
Right.

188
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:39,414
What was it again?

189
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:43,126
Closing Ohio State, guys.
They're kicking off.

190
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:47,130
- Who you like? Iowa?
- No difference, as long as it pays out.

191
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:50,425
Chris, fuck. Oregon vs. USC?

192
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:54,387
See, I told you we should have
fucking laid off some of that action.

193
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:59,392
Spread's 11. Oregon's down by 12,
they're on the 45-yard line, no timeouts.

194
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:02,979
Oregon's got an
All-American fucking field-goal kicker.

195
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,565
Why didn't somebody tell me?

196
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:08,484
- See?
- And it's good!

197
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,696
Forty-three yarder.

198
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:15,783
USC, that spread could've opened at 18,
fucking top-10 team!

199
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:19,829
Even so, we should have laid off some
of the action. Paulie did it all the time.

200
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,457
You see him here?

201
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,541
(PHONES RINGING)

202
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:27,754
What's the matter with you people?
You deaf? Answer the fucking phones!

203
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:35,219
- Minor setback, that's all.
- Oh, yeah?

204
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,473
- The frost is on the pumpkin.
- Supposed to warm up again.

205
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,100
Good football weather.

206
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:44,437
Mom said to tell you she's
waiting for the meat.

207
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:47,273
- Did Jackie Jr. show yet?
- I don't know.

208
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:53,029
- Little fuck promised his mother he'd be here.
- Watch your language in front of my kid.

209
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:59,368
Probably keeping a booth warm
at the O.F., him and Dino Zerilli.

210
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:07,627
What's Jackie Jr. doing? I promised his old
man I'd try to keep him out of this shit.

211
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:10,797
- He's the heir apparent.
- Not this kid.

212
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:14,092
Do me a favor. You watch
out for Jackie, okay?

213
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:17,470
You ought to turn that one link there.

214
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,307
Little setback, huh?

215
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:28,147
Ro, your kid's late.
He's being rude, he should be set straight.

216
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:32,110
He'll be here. I paged him.
Honey, the poor kid lost his dad.

217
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,529
I lost mine when I was 6.

218
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:38,825
Ralph had to drop out in the 11th grade
to raise his brothers and sisters.

219
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,244
You'd never know it.

220
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:46,499
I'm Satan to this kid,
just because I'm in love with his mom.

221
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:50,878
- What are we talking about?
- Hey, A.J. The cheerleaders. Any hotties?

222
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:54,549
There's no cheerleaders
for freshman ball.

223
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:59,262
These are Mario Batali's string beans,
with Parmesan.

224
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,305
(PHONE)

225
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:09,105
- You are very late, young man.
- It's me.

226
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,315
- Meadow! Hi, babe.
- Who is it?

227
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:15,570
- It's Meadow. What are you doing?
- Nothing. What's going on there?

228
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:18,948
- Well, Sunday dinner.
- Yeah?

229
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,577
- You wanna talk to your father? He's outside.
- Burning a cross?

230
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,956
I'm not sure I know what you're driving at,
but I know now is not the proper time.

231
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:31,043
- Here, your brother wants to talk to you.
- No, I don't.

232
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,214
- Hello?
- Hey. What's up?

233
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:38,885
- Everybody's here. It's really boring.
- Is that Jackie?

234
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:43,139
It's not him. It's Meadow from school.

235
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:46,434
Hold on, call waiting. Hello?

236
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,603
- My mother there?
- Yeah. One minute.

237
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:53,274
Aunt Ro? Yeah, I gotta go.

238
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:55,860
Thank you.

239
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,238
- Jackie, where are you?
- I can't make it.

240
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:04,452
- We're all waiting. You promised.
- Fuck it.

241
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:15,254
The way he talks to me...

242
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:19,967
You know what? I'll bring it up to Tony,
maybe he'll talk to him.

243
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:30,686
(SNORING)

244
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,484
Paulie?

245
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:47,495
What time is it?

246
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:53,501
That's almost all of it. Warren
probably told you about Oregon-USC.

247
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:59,340
- This is unacceptable.
- It's $4000, Paulie.

248
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:03,010
- I'll have the rest in a couple days.
- I thought I made myself clear.

249
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:07,974
Fucking college ball.
But I learned a valuable lesson.

250
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,894
I'm not running a school here, kid.

251
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,314
Paulie, this is me.
You know I'm good for it.

252
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:19,652
Don't fucking drag in our friendship.
This isn't about that. You work for me.

253
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:22,321
- Yeah, I want to...
- Just shut your mouth and listen.

254
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,407
I'll give you a few days...

255
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:29,245
...but it'll cost you another two G's
as a reminder not to fuck it up.

256
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,872
I make myself clear?

257
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:37,712
And don't give me the malocchio.
I'm not the one with the short bag.

258
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:53,060
Any word from your Ivy Leaguer?
And how's Carm with the empty nest?

259
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:57,565
What empty? Meadow's always home
with laundry or hauling food out.

260
00:21:57,774 --> 00:22:00,359
All that talk, she didn't go far.

261
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:04,530
We created too nice a home life.
They don't wanna go out in the world.

262
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:10,202
But, hey, if they're closer to us than we
were with our parents, is that bad?

263
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,713
- What time is it?
- I'm here, aren't I?

264
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:25,343
- Out of respect to my father.
- I gotta make two phone call.

265
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:27,636
Sit down.

266
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:38,731
- You want something to eat?
- I'm not hungry.

267
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,693
That's too bad. I said lunch meeting.

268
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:45,613
You want a drink?

269
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,081
Lose the glasses.

270
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:02,713
I'm gonna say a few things.

271
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:09,303
I'm gonna say some bad words,
and you're just gonna have to deal with it.

272
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:13,682
Now, I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking I clipped your uncle.

273
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:18,145
On the one hand, you'd be a shithead to
believe me when I told you I didn't do it.

274
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,481
But I didn't.

275
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:25,319
And I got some bad news for you.
Look at me.

276
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,072
Look at me.

277
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:33,786
- Your uncle was a rat.
- No fucking way!

278
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:37,623
Sit down. Sit down. Sit the fuck down.

279
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:46,298
Your uncle was a rat, and now he's
in the Witness Protection Program.

280
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:53,180
- That's my father's brother you're talking about.
- I'm a member of your family, almost.

281
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:57,810
You think I'm the only one
that knows this about Richie?

282
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:03,023
You ask anybody. This hurt all of us.

283
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:14,201
Jesus Christ.

284
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:17,621
Your dad and me,
you know how close we were?

285
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:23,669
He never wanted this for you.
He wanted you to be a doctor.

286
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,713
Give me a fucking break.

287
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:31,051
Let me tell you something. Besides the
money, doctor's a very powerful position.

288
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,928
I'm no doctor.

289
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:37,475
You know how hard you have to work
to get your MD? How many years it takes?

290
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:42,188
I was even thinking maybe osteopathy, but I
don't think I have the grades for that even.

291
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:45,399
You're not gonna drop out of Rutgers,
are you?

292
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:50,446
No. But those fucking premed courses
almost killed me.

293
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,448
I only did it because my dad was sick.

294
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:57,369
But you should know,
he never wanted this life for you.

295
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:02,208
And I'll tell you something.
I don't want it for my son either.

296
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:03,501
Hut!

297
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:10,549
Come on! Let's go, I wanna see
you hit them! Get off the ball!

298
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:21,352
Fourth and three and this cetriolo
is going for it? With that offensive line?

299
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:23,854
And why's my kid still
sitting on the bench?

300
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:28,442
The coach will let him in. Freshman rules,
they all get to play one quarter.

301
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,861
Pucillo in for Sposato!

302
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,739
Hey, Pucillo played already! Put my kid in!

303
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:37,826
It's the rules.

304
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,245
Hut!

305
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,664
(WHISTLING)

306
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,459
I told you they wouldn't make it.

307
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:49,505
Are you fucking crazy, ref?
Are you fucking crazy? What?

308
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:52,174
What did you say? No!
Come here and say that to me!

309
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,594
- Romano. The periodontist.
- Get off the field, you asshole!

310
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,930
I'll rip your fucking heart out!

311
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:01,976
- Look. Anthony's going in.
- All right, A.J!

312
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,148
Okay, defense, 41 stack.

313
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:12,987
- A.J! Stick them, baby!
- Stick them! Do it!

314
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:17,449
- Fumble!
- Fumble!

315
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,159
(CHEERING)

316
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:22,204
Up! Up! Everybody up! Wait, get up.

317
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,924
Red ball.

318
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,641
(CHEERING IN SLOW MOTION)

319
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:54,486
It's A.J! Yeah!
Yeah! Good job, A.J!

320
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:57,031
Good job, good job. Yeah!

321
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,159
Hey! Hey!

322
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:02,620
That's my son.

323
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:09,209
You got a nose for the ball,
and that can't be taught.

324
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:13,005
The defensive lineman, you gotta
have leverage and footwork.

325
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:18,218
I remember staying after practice every day,
hitting that sled till my shoulder was raw.

326
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:20,429
But then you gotta reward yourself.

327
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:23,932
So I'll take you to Stewart's
and buy you some dogs.

328
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,101
I just wanna go home.

329
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:30,314
You should be riding high after what
you did on the field today. Come on!

330
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:33,734
Wanna play some Nintendo? You and me?

331
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:36,904
When are you gonna throw that
thing out the freaking window?

332
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:41,617
- Why?
- Well, all right. Play Nintendo.

333
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:46,205
Okay, let's go to Stewart's.

334
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:48,624
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

336
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:03,472
- Yeah?
- I need you home, Tony, for dinner.

337
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:07,017
- Now? It's our busiest season.
- I know.

338
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:11,980
It's important with Meadow gone that we not turn
into a family who eats standing at the counter.

339
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:14,108
All right. I'll be there.

340
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:19,405
Pass the potatoes, please.

341
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:24,493
Anthony? The potatoes?

342
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:28,080
- Sorry.
- Every night.

343
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:32,626
Go ahead. Pour yourself another glass.

344
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:36,547
You need good bones
for those open-field tackles.

345
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:43,470
So...
How was everybody's day today?

346
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,180
Busy.

347
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:53,605
So Nana was asking me today
where you might wanna go to college.

348
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,649
- I don't know.
- West Point.

349
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:58,277
- West Point?
- Yeah, that's what you said.

350
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:01,196
- No, I didn't.
- You did. You were sitting right there.

351
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:07,369
- You said either Harvard or West Point.
- No way I'd ever have said that. I'd never get in.

352
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:16,044
- Can we eat with the TV on?
- No.

(PHONE)

354
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,635
I gotta take that. It's my busy season.

355
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:28,182
- Yeah?
- Mom there?

356
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:30,601
Hey, how are you?

357
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,644
Is Mom there?

358
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:36,982
- Yeah, she's here. How's school?
- Fine.

359
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,234
Is Mom there?

360
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:46,283
- Is that Meadow? Can I talk?
- Yeah, you can have her.

361
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:49,036
Hello?

362
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:53,248
Did you hear what happened
to Bobby Capodianco?

363
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,222
I feel bad. Taking your old room.

364
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:11,725
Don't worry about it.
You're all settled in.

365
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:14,978
You could sleep in your mother's room.

366
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:17,564
- Pass.
- Won't be for long.

367
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:24,446
Bill's children going to live with their
mother, end of week. I stay with him.

368
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:31,829
A few days is not a problem.
I'm glad I can help you out.

369
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:36,458
God knows my brother used to sleep
like a fucking dead man in there.

370
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:41,421
I'm sorry about how I behaved
at the cemetery.

371
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:45,133
Janice. I cannot give records back.

372
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,386
I wish you'd reconsider.

373
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:52,975
I know Livia left no will,
but possession is 9/10 of law.

374

Let's not descend into that.

375
00:30:55,854 --> 00:31:00,357
Feeling in me is,
she is not here to ask.

376
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:05,237
I know. I'm sorry.
Just this is an emotional issue for me.

377
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:08,782
I thought that if we had the chance
to talk one-on-one...

378
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:13,745
...I could make you understand
how much those records mean to me.

379
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:17,583
Just promise me you'll sleep on it.

It was a coincidence.

383
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:51,325
I was making good jack at that betting parlor! I
was in the zone. Now everything turns to shit?

384
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:56,872
The bird thing is if it's in the house, flapping
around. And that's death, not bad luck.

385
00:31:57,081 --> 00:32:00,918
- Will your mother loan me the money?
- She's still paying for her hysterectomy.

- She put into my Sprite three Halcyon.

I miss you so much, Tony.

412
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:47,667
Why don't we just stick to the subject?
Your cousin's missing a leg.

413

doing here, except you worked it this way.

492
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:05,772
- Probably.
- Pretty sick, huh?

493
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:08,191
Getting turned on by free cold cuts?

494
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:12,111
Do you think that your mother
questioned why the meat was free?

495
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:15,490
The meat that was going
into her children's mouths?

496
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:20,912
I don't know. I don't wanna know.
I don't wanna think about any of this shit.

497
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:27,126
I'm sure it was too much for you then
too. That's why you short-circuited.

498
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:32,924
Puberty. Witnessing not only your
mother and father's sexuality...

499
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:36,970
...but also the violence and blood
so closely connected...

500
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:40,640
...to the food you were about to eat.

501
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:43,893
And also, the thought that someday...

502
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:48,314
...you might be called upon
to bring home the bacon.

503
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:52,443
- Like your father.
- All this from a slice of capocollo?

504
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:56,739
Kind of like Proust's madeleines.

505
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:59,534
- What?
- Marcel Proust.

506
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:04,956
Wrote a seven-volume classic,
Remembrance of Things Past.

507
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:07,083
He took a bite of a madeleine.

508
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:11,879
It's a kind of tea cookie
he used to have as a child.

509
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:17,468
And that one bite unleashed
a tide of memories of his childhood...

510
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:20,513
...and ultimately of his entire life.

511
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:24,601
This sounds very gay.
I hope you're not saying that.

512
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,686
No.

513
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:33,526
Understanding root causes will make you
less vulnerable to future episodes.

514
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:36,571
My fucking head is swimming here.

515
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:42,285
We're gonna have to stop.
It's a lot to process.

516
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:46,706
But we've made real progress today.
Good work.

517
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:52,670
And I'd really like you to write down
any thoughts or associations.

518
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:57,467
You see the left tackle?

519
00:43:57,676 --> 00:44:01,346
He fakes inside,
and then gets a spin move on the guy.

520
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:04,599
Now he's charging the quarterback.
See?

521
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:07,977
- I thought the tailback had it.
- You gotta keep your eye on the ball.

522
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:09,896
The ball. That's what it's all about.

523
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:13,191
- Okay, I'm going.
- Where?

524
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:18,029
I gotta bring Med her biking shoes,
she's been missing my braciole.

525
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:21,783
- Can I come?
- Hey, we're watching the game.

526
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:25,078
I like going to the city.
I can catch the game in the car.

527
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:28,247
It's nice he wants to visit his sister.

528
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:33,169
- You're right. I'll get my shoes.
- Why don't you watch your game?

529
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:36,047
What, I shouldn't go now?

530
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:40,468
A.J., why don't you bring this stuff
out to the car?

531
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:51,813
This is about Sambo, right?
I'm paying for that goddamn college.

532
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:56,818
I don't know what's going on. But if you wanna
make a big scene at your daughter's new college...

533
00:44:57,027 --> 00:45:01,155
...then comb your hair and come
right along. Embarrass her.

534
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:04,784
Alienate her. Or better yet, cut her off.

535
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:09,539
Let her drop out and go to a state
school. Or maybe move back in here.

536
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:18,381
I was just trying to protect her from
herself. And I'll do that till the day I die.

537
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:26,472
I'm not gonna tell you you can't come.
She's your daughter.

538
00:45:30,185 --> 00:45:32,812
I'll probably watch the game.

539
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:49,829
(DOOR CLOSING)

540
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:53,332
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)
Come on, find the open man!

541
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:56,002
You gotta throw the ball.

542
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:58,671
Let it rip, already!

543
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:05,261
ANNOUNCER: Garcia handing off
at the 40-yard line across to the 43.

544
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:09,474
I got your favorite
Santa Barbara olives.

545
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:12,685
Leave me the fuck alone.

546
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:24,822
Chicken shit cocksuckers. Go for the touchdown.
I need another five points to cover the spread.

547
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:30,411
Hi. Pardon me.

548
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:34,665
Here she is. Come on. Meadow!

549
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:37,543
We're here.

550
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:40,129
- Hi.
- Hi.

551
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:44,133
- This is my mom and my little brother, A.J.
- Hey.

552
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:48,304
- Dad didn't come?
- No, he didn't. Did you want him to?

553
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:55,895
- Noah, would you mind?
- Noah told me what Dad said to him.

554
00:46:56,104 --> 00:47:01,317
- It's out in the open, so fuck this.
- Let's watch the latrine-lip.

555
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:04,779
Oh, well, what'd Dad say?

556
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:09,742
Anthony, would you go downstairs and wait for
me? I would like to talk to your sister.

557
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:14,747
- Oh, I know what he said.
- Go.

558
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:21,546
I'm always being sent away.
Why do I bother going anywhere?

559
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:27,009
- What did your father say?
- Like he didn't tell you. Please.

560
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:31,848
- Well, believe what you like...
- He called Noah things that are so ugly...

561
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:33,850
...I can't even repeat it.

562
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:40,022
- You're right. There's no excuse.
- He's lucky I didn't punch his fucking lights out.

563
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:44,443
- Because you're a civilized person.
- So this was gonna be a big drama?

564
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:48,698
You wanted your father to come here for
what? To subject your friend to this again?

565
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:51,534
Wait. So I'm in the wrong?

566
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:53,995
The rest of the world
should work around...

567
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:59,041
...his racist, retrograde,
fucking-asshole personality?

568
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:04,213
He comes from a place and a time
where he thinks it's in your best interest.

569
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:08,009
New Jersey? The third millennium?

570
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:10,636
Noah, I'm sure you must know
what I'm talking about.

571
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:14,765
Coming from a racially-mixed marriage
must have been a difficult burden.

572
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:19,437
Don't slam his family background.
Look what you wound up in!

573
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:23,733
Noah, would you excuse us a moment?
I want a word with my daughter.

574
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:27,194
I'm not going anywhere
unless she wants me to.

575
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:31,157
It's okay. I'll be up in a little while.

576
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:57,808
I would hate to think you're airing
your family's business in public.

577
00:48:57,976 --> 00:49:02,647
Noah's not stupid.
It took him a while, but he caught on.

578
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:05,066
But he keeps his opinions to himself.

579
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:10,071
Unlike some people,
he's brilliant and sensitive.

580
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,948
I'll keep my mouth shut.

581
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:16,160
Anything I say to you
or your father will just fuel this.

582
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:19,413
I'm not gonna stop seeing Noah.

583
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:25,753
I put your helmet in there and your padded shorts.
Though I'd rather you not bike in the city.

584
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:29,507
If you must know, I'm going to
Litchfield, Connecticut...

585
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:35,596
...to the weekend home of Noah's
parents' friends, who work at NBC.

586
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:53,739
But Hegel is talking about...

587
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:14,343
- Svetlana, get out here!
- Oh, hi.

588
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:17,555
You must be the famous Bill.
It's moving day, huh?

589
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:22,518
Oh, I didn't think you would have
the nerve to show your face to me.

590
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:27,523
- Why? What happened? What's wrong?
- Don't bullshit me. Where is my leg?

591
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:32,278
- Your leg? Oh, yeah, where's your...?
- I know you took it.

592
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:35,281
That's preposterous.
What possible use would I have for it?

593
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:40,244
Because you think that will make me
give records back, but you are wrong.

594
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:43,956
If you see some karmic connection
between your taking my mother's records...

595
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:47,418
...and the disappearance of your leg, wow!

596
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:52,131
The records return, and so does
the leg. I can see how you got there.

597
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:55,134
I don't know how you can
live with yourself.

598
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:58,054
Bill, don't waste breath.

599
00:50:58,263 --> 00:51:02,725
This cunt is gonna be sorry
she ever fuck with me.

600
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:10,066
You better hope you have all your shit
because I'm calling the locksmith.

601
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:18,908
Doc. Where's Dino?

602
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:21,285
- They got him for possession.
- Shit.

603
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:22,578
What do you care?

604
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:26,582
He mentioned that job over at Rutgers.
A coffeehouse.

605
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:31,087
Coffeehouse, shit. We were gonna
jack a benefit concert there tonight.

606
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:34,340
- Jewel and Amnesty International.
- You know the details?

607
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:37,676
- Can you make it work without Dino?
- It was my fucking idea.

608
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:52,358
I know this must be hard for you, Anthony.

609
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:56,654
Your sister off at college,
you here at home all by yourself with us.

610
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:59,115
But it won't be for long.

611
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:02,910
Pretty soon, you'll be heading
off to college yourself.

612
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:07,123
- I don't think I'm gonna go.
- What, college? Of course you will.

613
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:11,043
I don't wanna talk about it right now.

614
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:16,173
There's so many people there,
all smarter than me. A bunch of freaks.

615
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:18,050
What?

616
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:24,723
You're not excused!

617
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:29,812
- You're punished!
- He's all right.

618
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:42,158
Under no circumstances move this car
or your life will not be worth shit.

619
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:45,161
- Get me Jewel's autograph.
- You're a good kid.

620
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:48,330
I'll bring you her underpants.

621
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,925
- All goes in there, no one gets shot.
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

622
00:53:12,814 --> 00:53:15,649
- You're robbing a benefit concert.
- Is that all there is?

623
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:17,276
I'll fucking blow your head off!

624
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:21,739
- Most people used student cards.
- Hey! What's going on, you?

625
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:25,868
Say one word on that fucking thing
and you're dead!

626
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:27,036
(SCREAMING)

627
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:33,334
(FEMALE SCREAMING)

628
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:40,049
Hit it!

629
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:07,993
There's your money.

630
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:16,335
- You ought to hit a tanning salon.
- I had a late night.

631
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:21,757
You gotta give that shit a rest.
A man needs his seven hours to keep sharp.

632
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:27,179
This was work. Little Jackie hyped us
to a score at Rutgers, not bad.

633
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:30,474
What's the matter, Chrissy?
Tell Uncle Paulie.

634
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:34,770
This being made isn't like I thought.
A lot of responsibilities.

635
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:38,983
- Fucking A. What did you think?
- You're only as smart as the week's lines.

636
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:42,695
One false move and you spend your time
chasing it, instead of making money.

637
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:46,448
Welcome to the NFL, rookie.
Go home, get some sleep.

638
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:49,118
Tomorrow's a new day.

639
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:03,507
Sorry I'm late. I had to make a few stops.

640
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:08,053
- Have a smelt.
- No.

641
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:11,098
We had a very good week
this week, boss.

642
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:16,103
- How's our little friend doing?
- He had a few knocks...

643
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:18,439
...but it came out all right.

644
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:21,358
Wait'll he hears the policy
on newly-made guys.

645
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:24,695
They're subject to strip search
for wires and shit.

646
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:27,197
He'll love that.

647
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:32,161
He had to augment his kick with a stickup
at Rutgers little Jackie put him onto.

648
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:34,663
Jackie Aprile?

649
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:39,001
- He did the thing in the papers?
- Don't worry. He was only the wheel man.

650
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:44,882
- I told Christopher to leave him the fuck out.
- I'm just telling you what I know.

651
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:50,554
(PHONE)

652
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:53,557
(PHONE AND BEEPER)

653
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:03,359
Don't be too hard on Chrissy.
He's having a hard enough time as it is.

654
00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:06,862
Yeah, but what's wrong with the kid?
When's he gonna grow up?

655
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:10,199
- Where's Soprano?
- Here.

656
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:16,622
Guys, take a good look at Soprano here
and remember his performance last week.

657
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:21,543
Soprano's on the sidelines three whole
quarters, waiting. But does his mind go soft?

658
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:25,214
No. Does his fire go out? Heck, no.

659
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:28,258
When the call came,
he brought his A game.

660
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:31,553
This young man may have a big future.
He may be a leader.

661
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:36,725
And that's what it takes. And that's
why I'm naming him defensive captain.

662
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:45,317
All right! All right. So let's hit
those showers, one thought in mind...

663
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:48,487
Soprano! Soprano, you all right?
