How are you feeling,
from your accident?

Fine, thank you.

Honestly, if you'd told me five years
ago I'd be sitting here today...

7
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:34,319

how do they make you feel?

Helpless.

11
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:48,667
- Frustrated, maybe.
- With your inability to help him?

12
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,336
I was referring to your
inability to help him.

13
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:56,466
She has helped me.
What are you saying?

14
00:02:56,676 --> 00:03:01,555
It's been three years,
you still pass out on a regular basis.

15
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,142
I understand your frustration.

16
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:09,980
Did he share our insights
about his last panic attack?

17
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:15,527
I told you, remember? The capocollo,
and my mother when I was a kid.

18
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,696
Right, yes.

19
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:24,870
Is there anything in the family dynamic
that could serve as a trigger?

20
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:28,874
- Something in your dialoguing?
- Excuse me?

21
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:34,046
I don't know you that well.
We're trying to get to root causes.

22
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:39,718
- Maybe you do things that affect me.
- Oh, really?

23
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:43,513
What?
People affect each other in life.

24
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,724
Oh, is this how it works?

25
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:49,686
You're looking for someone
to point the finger at?

26
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:53,023
She didn't say anything.
Don't get defensive!

27
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:57,444
You know what? Maybe you should
explore your own behavior.

28
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,906
Maybe you pass out
because you're guilty.

29
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:06,119
You stick your dick in anything,
maybe that's a root cause.

It's like smoking your whole life
and then suing cigarette companies.

fucking communicate?

Febby lived a full life,
a life of service to others.

143
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:56,608
His 78 years saw him serve
his family as a devoted father...

00:12:56,859 --> 00:13:00,779
...his country as a supply sergeant
in the Pacific...

145
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:06,785
...and most importantly,
our Lord as a devout Catholic.

146
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:10,121
When I last visited Febby
in the hospital...

147
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:13,583
...he'd finished his chemotherapy.

148
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:19,172
Though frail and extremely thin,
his fighting spirit was still intact.

149
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,008
His body was wracked with pain.

Buon'anima.
He should rest in peace.

170
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,384
Ninety-four pounds when he died.

171

173
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,516
As long as I got you here...

174
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:59,355
Your godson, Mustang Sally Intile.
He did a Lee Trevino off a guy's head.

175
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:04,485
That prick is my godson in name only.
It was a favor to his father.

176
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:08,072
Well, I'm just saying, because...

177
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,783
...this isn't the first time.

178
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,786
You do whatever you gotta do.

179
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,581
Just so you heard it from me.

180
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:21,920
Thank you. And I appreciate you
looking out for Bobby.

181
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:25,423
He's been a huge help with my uncle.

182
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,426
That one don't need any help.

183
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,930
He's out of jail on a fucking medical.

184
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,266
He makes me laugh, your uncle.

185
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:40,438
Yeah, we're talking about you,
you cagey fuck!

186
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:43,775
- You got them all fooled.
- Yeah, that's right.

187
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,401
(HONKING)

188
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:49,238
There's Bobby.
I'm sorry for your loss.

189
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,532
- See you later.
- Okay.

190
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,787
(COUGHING)

191
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:57,956
Hey, Hey, Hey.

192
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,333
What the fuck, he's really sick?

193
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:01,626
That cough.

194
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:05,421
He smoked those Camels
since he's in short pants.

195
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:10,259
- Lung cancer? Oh, fuck.
- Another toothpick.

196
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:13,763
What kind of way is that
to talk about a sick person?

197
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:23,356
- Good night, now.
- Good night. Thank you.

198
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:33,116
Forty-two years. My God.

199
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:37,620
When it's right, it's right.

200
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:41,624
We said we'd save the Barolo
for a big night?

201
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:45,211
Check out these numbers.

202
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:45,962
Heh?

203
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:49,882
- My God! I knew we were busy, but...
- Not bad, eh?

204
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,096
# LA DI DA #

205
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:59,058
I think I'm gonna pass
on the wine tonight.

206
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:04,605
A night like this,
you're gonna make me drink alone?

207
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:07,358
What is it, you okay?

208
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:14,699
You know I love it here,
and you are such a great boss...

209
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:18,494
...but Christopher doesn't
want me working anymore.

210
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:24,751
- Please don't be mad.
- No, I'm not mad. I'm happy for you.

211
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,211
You know, with his change
in situation...

212
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,463
You know how he is.

213
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,924
You think I wanna be stuck
in this prison?

214
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:36,888
I wanted to give you notice. I was
supposed to tell you two weeks ago.

215
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,933
Is it okay if tonight's my last night?

216
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:44,937
Yeah, I guess I'll get
Charmaine to cover.

217
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:49,317
Thank you!
I was so nervous about telling you.

218
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,363
Christopher's picking me up.
I'm gonna fix my makeup.

219
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:55,073
Okay.

220
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,742
Of course.

221
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,304
You're not gonna jump me?

222
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:22,767
- What?
- I'm open here. I'll have to king you.

223
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,979
Fuck it, I don't want to play.

224
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,941
I don't really want to either.

225
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:37,698
- What's with you? All day, Gloomy Gus.
- Sorry, it's just...

226
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,451
It's my father.

227
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,579
He's tough, he'll beat it.

228
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:48,292
- It's not the cancer, it's Tony.
- Tony? What about him?

229
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,294
Don't speak in anagrams.

230
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:55,091
- He okayed my dad to hit Sally.
- He put that kid in a coma.

231
00:18:55,300 --> 00:19:00,972
Fuck Sally, I'm worried about my
father. He's been retired seven years.

232
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,099
Are we in the Navy?

233
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:08,229
It's not that.
This was a proud man, Junior.

234
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:15,695
He's over the other night, I had to
help him off the toilet, he's so weak.

235
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:21,325
Shut the fuck up with the toilets!
All this morbidity!

236
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,875
I'm sorry, you're right.

237
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,169
Fuck.

238
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:35,256
This point in his life,
to have him do a thing like this.

239
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:41,679
I never ask you for anything.
Tell Tony I'll do it if he wants.

240
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,557
Fuck what he wants.
I'm the boss.

241
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,769
You're right, I'm sorry.

242
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,314
Stop your crying! I'll tell him.

243
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:54,025
Making me fucking depressed now.

244
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:58,529
Bacala's okay with it.
Why do you care?

245
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:03,868
- What is it with these power trips?
- What the fuck are you talking about?

246
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:05,077
(KNOCKING)

247
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:09,540
- Pardon me. May I?
- Yeah.

248
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:18,174
- Your girl got any coffee out there?
- I think we can rustle some up.

249
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:22,345
Tax code, another client.
IRS troubles.

250
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:27,099
Sorry, Mel. To find a place
they're not allowed to bug...

251
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:33,064
- Dr. Schreck's office is full.
- I sit too much anyway.

252
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:42,406
It has to be the old man?
There's no other way?

253
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:45,451
There's a million ways,
but this'll work.

254
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:48,412
It was Gigi's idea,
I'm not cutting his balls off.

255
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:56,545
Sally's MIA. Two days ago he
reaches out to Bacala for help.

256
00:20:56,755 --> 00:21:02,593
Old man Bacala's his godfather, he can
get close without arousing suspicion.

257
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:05,763
- Doesn't sit right.
- He's done it before.

258
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:09,267
- He's a sick man!
- It's something to live for.

259
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:22,780
I took those Duncan Sheik records
and shoved them up his ass.

260
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,367
Wait a minute.

261
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:29,453
- Who let this one in?
- Wolfgang Fuckface.

262
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:33,833
Hey, Artie.

263
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:42,675
The man who stole her away.

264
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:47,054
Adriana, she gave her notice.

265
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,193
Help yourself.

266
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,657
You better be good to that girl.

267
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,868
You cocksucker.

268
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:11,579
No wonder the food sucks.

269
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,914
You're supposed to cook
with the wine, Artie.

270
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,708
Three years.

271
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:21,547
Best hostess I ever had.
This piece of shit steals her away.

272
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:26,093
- Artie, come on.
- He knows I'm breaking his balls.

273
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,345
Alright.

274
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:36,312
Seriously, though.
I'm you, I hire a food taster.

275
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,814
Don't fuck with a chef.

276
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:42,568
You're the only one
who can swing a meat cleaver?

277
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:45,363
- Fuck you.
- Artie.

278
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,824
I'm kidding!

279
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,704
Wanna try cooking
with one fucking eye?

280
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:56,374
That's enough!
Go wait outside!

281
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,251
Now!

282
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:13,974
What the fuck?

283
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:18,687
What the fuck is wrong with you?
She's his fiancée!

284
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,356
I loved her.

285
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,609
I fucking love her now.

286
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:34,412
Artie, do me a favor.

287
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:38,207
Don't ever fucking say that again
to anybody, ever.

288
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,751
What am I, a joke?

289
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:45,589
Yeah, a stupid fucking bald one.

290
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,842
Not to mention married.

291
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,303
Can I tell you something?

292
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:55,641
She's a cunt, my fucking wife.

293
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:02,398
A girl like Ade, that's a woman.
If I still had my hair...

294
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:06,235
She's a young girl. You could have
hair like fucking Casey Kasem.

295
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:08,112
It won't make a difference.

296
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,405
Yeah.

297
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:23,085
Now look, go in the back,
get some coffee.

298
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,464
Go home, go the fuck to sleep.

299
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,174
I should go apologize.

300
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:32,803
Not right now, okay?
Let me talk to Chris.

301
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:34,847
You go home.

302
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,435
Call me tomorrow.

303
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,064
Got a business opportunity
over in Newark.

304
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:51,155

00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,254
Mr. Spears for you on three.

Seth, I gotta take this.

307
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,800
All right.

308
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:14,094
Hey.

309
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,597
What about this speeding ticket?

310
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:19,975
- What?
- I just got a letter in the mail.

311
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,393
Throw it out.

312
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,688
I gotta call my guy down at the DMV?

313
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:29,527
It's a deplorable situation
and I'll take care of it.

314
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:33,155
Good news about the
riverfront esplanade thing.

315
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:36,617
Just straighten the fucking
ticket out, okay?

316
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,416
Where's your father?

317
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:49,046
He stopped by the bakery.
Wanted to pick up a shortcake.

318
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:51,507
He never comes empty-handed.

319
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,889
Talk to Tony?

320
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:02,768
No, I decided against it.
I didn't even call him.

321
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,854
This life comes with responsibilities.

322
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:09,567
- Your old man knows that.
- I was asking for me.

323
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:14,405
Teddy Roosevelt gave an entire
speech with a bullet in his chest.

324
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,615
Some things are a matter of duty.

No, no, no.

335
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,918
It's the nodules in his lungs.
It happens when he's out of breath.

These doctors, what are they doing?

Junior, I'm happy with my guy.

343
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:34,777
What is he doing?
Are you on chemo?

344
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:37,488
Is he giving you oxygen therapy?

345
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:41,575
Junior, the cure is worse
than the fucking illness!

Junior, I want to do it.

349
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:57,549
Eight years sitting on my ass.
It'll feel good being useful.

350
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:01,345
He's tough.
What if things don't go your way?

351

Arthur, you run a restaurant.

357
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:29,498
What do you know
about mass production?

358
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:36,213
I have an associate's in business.
We can't grow unless we take risks.

359
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:42,553
Going into business with a gangster
isn't a risk. It's a sure disaster.

360
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:46,890
It's legitimate.
It's part of the revitalization.

361

365

366

Then why is it called Satriale's?

367
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:03,907
The pork store has a customer base.
Name recognition.

368
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:10,247
Vesuvio doesn't? Your grandfather
opened up in the '30s, Arthur.

369

Tony talked to this marketing guy.

370
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:18,672
Brand names beginning with a "V"
make people think of vagina. Turnoff.

371

- What did you just say?
- Vaseline, et cetera.

The whole thing is...

373
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:29,099
- Can't you see the opportunities?
- To be a mob front.

374
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:33,353
- Jesus Christ, already.
- When are you gonna learn?

00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:58,629

through the fucking house.

380

382
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:07,471
So I hear you got old man Bacala
making a comeback?

383
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:12,434
He didn't hear it from me.

384
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:16,688
I'm not butting in.
Junior asked me to talk to you.

385
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,526
He's just looking out
for the old man.

386
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:23,153
It does seem a little extreme.

387
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:26,490
But my man Gigootz knows
what he's doing.

388
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:30,577
- Glad I have your fucking approval.
- Whatever you say, cappy.

389
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:37,751
Here it is. For you, Junior,
and anybody the fuck else.

390
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:41,922
Gigi's captain.
He gave the order.

391
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:45,425
I okayed it.
End of fucking story.

392
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:50,138
Tony, no offense.
Obviously it's your call.

393
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:51,932
Yeah, obviously.

394
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:06,321
- What?
- Nothing.

395
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:11,535
It's just, you send in an old man?

396
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:14,538
What's he gonna do,
gum him to death?

397
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:18,750
- Anybody ask for your input?
- No, no, I'm just saying.

398
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,712
You should let me do it.

399
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:28,176
I'll take the guy apart at the joints.
With him conscious.

400
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,496

- What, are you here on a stakeout?
- May I help you?

404
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:23,273
I need a piece of this.
Unless you wanna come over...

405
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:26,985
...check out my birdbath,
make sure it's up to code.

406
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:30,155
I'll check the computer.

407
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:45,128
Get your ticket book.
That constitutes indecent exposure.

408
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:48,090
I no longer need my ticket book.

409
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:53,637
Your friend, the assemblyman, had me
transferred to the property room.

410
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:58,558
- No longer the scourge of Cedar Grove?
- Nor eligible for overtime.

411
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,978
Leon, take your break at 2.

412
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:12,447
Just so you know, I didn't tell him
to do any of that shit.

413
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:17,828
That's very kind of you.

- Who is it?
- I don't know.

419
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:41,518
I'm going to Fortunoff's.

420
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:44,479
- When are you coming home?
- When I'm done.

421
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:50,861
- Hello?
- It's Ron. You paged me?

422
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:53,071
Oh, yeah, yeah.

423
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:57,367
I ran into that guy, the traffic cop?

424
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:02,039
- It's done, already taken care of.
- I know, it's just...

425
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:07,919
- You got him busted off the street?
- Isn't that what you wanted?

426
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:12,049
Yeah, but it's kind of harsh, no?

427
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:14,426
I spoke to his unit commander.

428
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,512
Nobody likes him.
He's a rabble-rouser.

429
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:21,516
Yeah, maybe. But I don't know, it...

430
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:25,562
It goes beyond you.
The guy's depressed or something.

431

some serious mental problems.

00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,988
I left my contacts home.

514
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:18,284
I don't know what it is, but you've
had a hair across your ass all week.

Lower your voice.

517
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:29,420
Still mad because I told you
you can't go in with Tony?

518
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:32,382
You don't tell me anything,
Charmaine.

519
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:35,343
And I'm going into business with Tony.

520
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:40,848
If you do this, Artie,
if you choose Tony over me...

521
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:43,101
What are you gonna do, divorce me?

522
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:52,652
- Is that what you want?
- What'd I say?

523
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:57,574
This marriage is over, Arthur.

524
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:00,451
- I'm serious.
- It's about fucking time.

525
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:03,246
And you're not getting
the kids, either!

526

529
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:22,181
- He volunteered to mow your lawn.
- I did not.

530
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,392
Hi, Anthony.

531
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:28,313
It's that time of year.
Brought the last of my sweet corn.

532

What's the matter?
You all right?

533
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:43,786
Anthony, be a good boy. Wait outside.
I need to talk to your father.

534
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:56,090
If this is about old man Bacala,
I don't wanna fucking hear it.

536
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:11,814
- You have what?
- Cancer. The big casino.

537
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,818
Jesus Christ, when did you find out?

538
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:20,281

539

your mother's funeral.

so fucking weird?

Is it in your colon, or?

544
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:54,774
- Did they say how bad?
- Won't know until they open me up.

545

I go in in two weeks.

546

- This has to stay between us, Anthony.
- Yeah, of course.

We'll get you the best there is.

Old man Bacala had it,
but now you'll get me help?

550
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,510
These things come in threes.

551
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:36,107
Is that why you didn't want
the old man to make the hit?

552
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:40,570
What, if he died of cancer,
he'd take your place?

553
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:46,701
- I asked you not to make him do it.
- Jesus Christ! Un-fucking-believable.

554

dummy up about this.

You're sick, people treat you
like a nonentity. I'm serious.

You can't talk about this
with anybody.

559
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:06,554
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:08,473

A lot of death.

564

Ma.

565
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:36,125
- Pop and the emphysema.
- Uncle Jun. Another toothpick.

566
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:39,462
Hey, Jan, come on.
A little respect, huh?

567
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:43,299
I'm sorry, it's just what Ma
used to say.

568
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:45,760
Yeah, that's right.

569
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:50,765
- She said that about her own brother.
- Another toothpick.

Liver cancer.

573
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:05,112
Jesus. These old-timers.

574
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:13,037
The more hard-ass their attitude,
the more they suppress their feelings.

575
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:16,916
- I think it's the illusion of control.
- Control?

576
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:23,506
You say the most horrible shit you can
think of in the face of tragedy.

577
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:25,967
It's like saying to God:

578
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:30,638
"See? You don't fool me, asshole.
I know what you're planning."

579
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:35,184
Yeah, like they're trying
to ward off evil, or some shit.

580

Remember how Ma,
she hated compliments?

581
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:41,023
Giving or taking them?

at any minute, boom!

Always comes in threes.

586
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:06,382
And then there's the Holy Trinity.

587
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:09,051
You think that's a coincidence?

Did you report it?

there's a thief?

- Who? What are you talking about?
- Nothing.

- Didn't you lock it up?
- They used bolt cutters.

One of the kids saw him.

- What?
- Did I say anything?

602

- They aren't.

- But the lamp?
- On battery backup.

- Why?
- Crime is economic, not racial.

I can't go because I'm sick!

682
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:38,894
I have cancer.

683
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:40,646
Cancer?

684
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:45,567
Oh, my God.

685
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:48,904
Real wisenheimer,
now how do you feel?

686
00:56:54,285 --> 00:56:58,622
Two weeks, I go in for the surgery,
and I'll start the chemo after that.

687
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:02,459
Junior, I'm sorry.

688
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:08,799
- I don't know what to say.
- I'll say a prayer for your old man.

689
00:57:13,054 --> 00:57:14,805
My father.

690
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:17,224
Now you?

691
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:20,310
What the fuck is happening?

692
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:23,230
(TV CHATTER)

693
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:25,941
You will miss the boat.

694
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:31,029
Lady, I missed the boat
a long time ago.

695
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:43,083
Including tax and delivery,
it comes to $897.23.

696
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:47,254
Just make sure it gets to my house
in one piece.

697
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:51,675
Come on.
