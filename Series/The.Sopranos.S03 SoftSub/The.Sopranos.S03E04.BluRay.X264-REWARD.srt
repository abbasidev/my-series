(PHONE RINGING)

3
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:46,688
Ton, will you get that?

4
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,236
- Hello.
- Tony, it's me.

5
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:54,988
Don't hang up.

6
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,243
Why are you calling here?
You know who could answer this phone?

7
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:04,123
Please. You're so conceited.
Do you think I want to call you?

8
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,960
I think you're drinking and dialing.
I can smell the Stoli from here.

9
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:11,922
Yell to your sister, not to me.
My poor cousin...

10
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,466
...has not had her prosthetic leg.

11
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:17,511
- What do you want me to do?
- Tony, please.

12
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,141
I miss you so much.
Can't you come over here?

13
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,476
Don't you ever call here again.

14
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:32,359
- Didn't you see my favorite patient?
- Tomorrow.

15
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:36,029
- How's that going?
- Let's not, Richard.

16
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,783
- I wish you hadn't taken him back.
- I took you back.

17
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:43,787
I see the synergy.
Treat him, we start seeing each other.

18
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,456
- Richard, Richard.
- No, seriously.

19
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:50,502
If you want to know, he had
a breakthrough last week.

20
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:55,716
- What? Through somebody's jaw?
- You're right, I'm wasting my time.

21
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:59,803
Better I boycott with
the Italian American Foundation...

22
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:05,434
...and save the world from
what is it this week? Gangster?

23
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:11,231
The very idea ABC would even think of
producing that stereotypical goombah fest.

24
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:16,820
Richard, we are an advertisement for
the American experiment. We did great.

25
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:22,409
I'm fed up with people assuming I'm a
thug because my name ends in a vowel.

26
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:26,205
Undershirts, yelling.
Hollywood gives these sociopaths...

27
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:29,082
...the tragic grandeur of Al Pacino.

28
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:32,711
He's an expert at this.
The guy's conning you.

29
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:37,799
Condescend to me, Richard.
It gets me so hot.

30
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:43,513
Tell me about this breakthrough.
You said he's alexithymic.

31
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,224
Nothing will get through.

32
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:50,103
Not if it threatens that straw house he's built
inside his head to shelter his criminality.

33
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:55,442
It concerns me you don't see this.
Pink-slip this guy. He's dangerous.

34
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,862
I'll pink-slip you if you don't
get the chicken in the oven.

35
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:04,952
Is that new?

36
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:08,872
- Looks good.
- Did you bring your log?

37
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:15,003
- My log?
- Remember? You were to keep a record.

38
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,673
I asked you to write down any feelings...

39
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:22,010
...of anxiety or memories
of past anxiety attacks.

40
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,138
My parents and the pork store. I know.

41
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:29,142
That was... it was interesting.

42
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:33,188
Have you thought at all about that?

43
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:37,442
- How do people find the time?
- To get well?

44
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:46,493
Look, my mother's dead.
I haven't had a panic attack since.

45
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:51,581
You've gone months without them before.
The conflicts that cause them...

46
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,335
...and your depression are
buried deep inside you.

47
00:04:57,588 --> 00:05:01,049
- Are you happy?
- Am I happy?

48
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:04,094
That's not even...

49
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:11,476
Look, I'm sorry
I didn't bring the list.

50
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,395
I'll bring it next week.

51
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,320
Will you ever think about
bringing your wife into this?

52
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,697
In here? Carmela?

53
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:27,951
You're the one who wanted to take
a more proactive approach.

54
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,287
That's not in the future.

55
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:36,877
Let's talk frankly.
You demanded more of me. Fine.

56
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:41,340
- But you're not trying.
- I know.

57
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,924
The past.

58
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:49,639
But shit happens in my daily
life that needs attention now.

59
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:53,143
I got some genuine concerns, you know.

60
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:57,773
About my son. He shies away
from anything that requires effort...

61
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:00,609
...and I think he picks
that up from me.

62
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,197
He's in football now. Carmela's as
guilty about this as I am.

63
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:06,615
She indulges him.

64
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,744
Richard was right.

65
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:14,915
I've been charmed by a sociopath.
Why didn't I listen?

66
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,416
Why do you think?

67
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:20,170
Why did I reject a good man like Richard
in the first place?

68
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,590
If you think about my life,
it's so textbook.

69
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,218
Marry a man 10 years my senior.

70
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:31,056
Of course Richard's gonna be
protective and patriarchal.

71
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:34,142
Then I reject him for being just that.

72
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,646
There's nothing wrong
with wanting to be safe.

73
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:41,191
I know Richard's right.
I should get Tony Soprano...

74
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:43,652
Shit.

75
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:49,282
I always thought it was that
other guy. Little Augie Aprile.

76
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:54,496
- I can't believe I revealed his name.
- Why did you?

77
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,501
Does Richard know who he is?

78
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:04,714
I think he saw it in my Day-Timer.
That's why he's been so adamant.

79
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,926
Because Soprano is very high up.

80
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,304
If he was some button man
you wouldn't treat him?

81
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,682
Please, with the terminology.

82
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:19,896
You know psychotherapy is limited
in the treatment of anxiety disorder.

83
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:25,444
You've medicated Soprano and helped
him gain what insight he's able to absorb.

84
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:29,156
It's time to send him
on to a behaviorist.

00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,229
Janice.

91
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,693
I was cleaning up.

92
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,196
When did you change the locks?

93
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:13,241
The minute that Ukrainian dye-job
was out the door.

94
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,995
Don't mess with the Russians, Janice.

95
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:21,666
She can have her leg when
she returns Ma's record collection.

96
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:27,255
- You would've done the same thing.
- I'm getting calls from her cousin.

97
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,716
Miss Carburetor Works of 1987?

98
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:33,345
Don't fuck with me on this.
Give back the leg.

99
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:38,433
Tony, those records are yours too.
It's sad that you don't care.

100
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:43,230
Those old albums...
They're a window into Ma's soul.

(CHUCKLING)

102
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:47,651
In fact, I'm making a documentary.

103
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:52,239
World War II generation's music,
exemplified by Ma.

104
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:56,535
Who are you kidding?
You're gonna sell them on the Internet!

105
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,454
- I have work to do.
- Cleaning the cellar.

106
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:04,084
Good luck finding gold. You'd make
more money working a real job.

107
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:10,423
Like the minute I'm out you won't have
contractors tearing apart the walls.

108
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,342
Oh, Janice.

109
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,221

EH-EH-EH.

111
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:34,072
You finished? I wanna meet my bud at
the gym, we're gonna spar.

112
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,410
You got a girlfriend?

113
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:44,833
You know who's turning into a little
mink, though? Meadow Soprano.

114
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,793
Look at him perk up.

115
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:50,755
- I've known her since we were kids.
- Speaking of the royal family...

116
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,341
I heard you did a stickup with Chris.

117
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:57,137
I wanted to fly to South Beach.
Mom wouldn't pay.

118
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:59,764
Don't worry. I'm won't tell her.

119
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,434
Look, kid...

120
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:06,479
I'm trying real hard here.

121
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,024
I know it's tough on you.

122
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:12,611
- I'm the guy that's dating your mom.
- Dating?

123
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,946
Don't get fucking filthy about it.

124
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,701
Anyway this...

125
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:24,247
This was a good idea she had,
us going out to dinner.

126
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,959
Not that one conversation
ever solved anybody's problems.

127
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:32,339
I'm only here so I don't have
to hear her bitching and crying.

128
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,343
The gym, huh?

129
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,267
Mind if I make a stop first?

(DOOR OPENING)

131
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,695
My brother is out.
He said you knew.

132
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,864
I get the bad-tempered one.

133
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:01,451
Bashir said that this
payment could be late...

134
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,870
...because we had truck problems.

135
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,665
Three of them needed new hydraulics.

136
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:10,085
- Nobody talked to me.
- He said you approved.

137
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:14,255
You're collecting on my routes.
You gotta pay me.

138
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,925
They're only your routes
because you say they are.

139
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:21,388
You wanna question New Jersey business
practice that goes back 70 years?

140
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,224
Hey!

141
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,434
What is this, Ralphie?

142
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,521
I ought to stick a shish kebab
up your ass.

143
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,233
Why do you provoke me?

144
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,819
This young buck.

145
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:40,490
He'll fuck your wife until she moans.

146
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,704
- You fucking wop. You began it.
- What did you call me?

147
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,581
- Bringing my wife in this!
- Put it down!

148
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,625
- Mister, come on!
- Hey!

149
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:51,876
OW!

150
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,212
- Get the fucking bat!
- Let go!

151
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,341
- You all right?
- Asshole!

152
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,803
School this prick.
In the breadbasket!

153
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:07,100
Good, kid. Introduce him to his desk.

154
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,439
Take an anger management course.

155
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,232
Fucking racial slurs.

156
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,359
Why you doing this to me?

157
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:25,410
That's what you get for using
a baseball bat.

158

- Yeah?
- Ginny. It's Tony Soprano.

with the moving. I'll get John.

00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,083
- The guinea welcome wagon.
- This is for you.

165
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:17,879
Carmela's bringing something nice to
the housewarming for Ginny.

166
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:25,428
This is the Great Room.
I don't see what's so great.

167
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,723
It's mediocre. We got a
living room right over there.

I didn't know you were moving.

Ginny wanted to be near her sisters,
you know, and the schools out here.

170
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:43,655
We were with Carmine.
You never mentioned this place.

171
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:46,074
It's not his favorite subject.

172
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,202
It's what, half an hour,
40 minutes over the bridge?

173
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,164
Why didn't you say you were moving?

174
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:55,875
- Why?
- I gotta find out second hand?

175
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:58,920
You care?
You working in a tollbooth?

176
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,673
Besides, I already got
the condo in Point Pleasant.

177
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:06,427
- You should have told me.
- I'm telling you now.

178
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:11,349
This is a place to live. I got no
intention of sticking my beak in.

179
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:15,103
I mean, there's our family
and then there's the Soprano family.

180
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:20,066
Don't I get to see the rest of this?

181
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:23,027
You can help me unstick
this rain bird.

182
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:26,197
I'm a stranger in
a strange land out here.

183
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,628
Look at this pair.

184
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:45,008
How many Neapolitans
to screw in a light bulb?

185
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:50,013
There's only candles in Naples.
The cardinal controls that racket.

186
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:52,891
That's a good one.

187
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,184
Use it on your paesans.

188
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:59,772
We don't have those bulb jokes.
They don't translate.

holding out on us.

192
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:13,661
- So you put his brother in an ambulance?
- He said a bad word.

193
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:17,999
Why would you take Jackie's kid
on something like that?

194
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:21,920
He's got to know how it works.
Kid's got a chip on his shoulder.

196
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:27,425

201
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:41,147
Being a parent,
that's the hardest job.

202
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,608
It's harder than this other shit.

203
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:49,113
- Like my first marriage and my kid...
- I got news you're not gonna like.

204
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:53,534
- I'm putting our friend in as captain.
- What?

205
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,373
No.

206
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:05,171
- Fucking Gigi, are you shitting me?
- I'm sorry.

207

I went too far. I'll take care of it.

This isn't the first.

209
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:18,393
At least tell the truth. You want your
own there to spy on the Aprile crew.

210
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,979
Yeah. But I shouldn't have to.

211

You got bad tendencies.
I sympathize because I do too.

Joe Brooklyn on shit at the port.

213
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:31,072
A bum decision.

214
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:34,367
The bottom line speaks.
I'm earning my ass off for you.

215
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:35,910
It's my decision.

I've been thinking about
your course of therapy.

220
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,103
You're the doctor.

221
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:08,276
You're ready to move on to
behavior modification therapy.

222
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,987
What's that mean?
Talk to somebody else?

223
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,907
Is this because of what
happened last time?

224
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:23,374
Look, I'm sorry. But like you said,
it's hard to think about that stuff.

225
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:27,128
- It took how long to even remember?
- I realize that.

226

You know, you're unbelievable.
I ask you to get serious in here.

you pawn me off on somebody else.

I'm just introducing the idea.
Something for you to think about.

I'm going to bring in things for you
about behavior modification therapy.

Yes, he was here earlier today.

231

Maybe you could.

I would discharge him...

...and I will, in my own good time.

She never said anything.

337
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:12,801
You just let him go?
Are you fucking crazy?

338
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:16,514
Yes, I do need to use
this kind of language!

339
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:19,600
- I don't care if you're sorry.
- Richard.

340
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,435
Fine, you do that.

341
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:26,190
You haven't heard the end of this.
I'm contacting my attorney. Asshole!

342
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,444
- What?
- Chain of custody was mishandled...

343
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:34,532
...so they let him go.
They let him go?

344
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:38,160
Somebody misplaced
the evidence kit or something...

345
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,288
I don't know what they did,
those idiots!

346
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:45,167
Is he just out until the trial?
I can identify him.

347
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,712
It's a legal thing. I think they
just have to let him skip.

348
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:54,176
That's impossible. You misunderstood.

349
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:56,387
Give me the phone.

350
00:25:56,596 --> 00:26:01,058
- I told you what he told me.
- Before or after you cursed at him?

351
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:05,896
- Give me the phone. I'll call them.
- All right. I'll call.

352
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:16,991
Detective Lindheim, please.
Yes, I'll hold.

353
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,909
Now it's not even the same cop.

354
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:27,167
Hello. Dick La Penna again. I want to
apologize for losing my temper.

355
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,379
Could I please have the phone?

356
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,131
Just a second.

357
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:42,600
Hello? I'm sorry, I don't
understand what's going on.

358
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:46,562
I don't know what you people did,
but I can identify him.

359
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:57,031
I don't know what to say. I'm stunned.

360
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:08,042
They had to let him go...

361
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:11,337
...because they fouled up
the chain of custody.

362
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:14,465
What am I gonna do?

363
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:18,135
You're gonna have someone
escort you to your car.

364
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:23,265
- What's that supposed to mean?
- That's what the counselor told me.

365
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:26,685
Deserted garages are
where attacks happen.

366
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:31,482
You think this is my fault.
Do you blame me for what happened?

367
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:35,319
I told you to call security
when it's late.

368
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:37,780
It wasn't late.

369
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:41,533
- This isn't doing any good.
- Let me tell you something.

370
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:44,662
If I hadn't have been on the
phone with you...

371
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:48,791
...maybe I would've seen
that guy in the stairwell.

372
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:52,503
- What?
- You and your hard-on about my patient!

373
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,005
So it's my fault?

374
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:58,300
You should've seen your face...

375
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:03,931
...when you heard that that shitbag
that raped me had an Italian name.

376
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:08,519
You're the one who told
them he was Puerto Rican.

377
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:10,979
What difference does it make?

378
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:13,607
Are you so ashamed
of your background...

379
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:18,696
...that any misdeed by an Italian
somehow damages your self-esteem?

380
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,864
This is so misdirected.

381
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:25,077
The whole fucking world's
about your self-esteem.

382
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:27,538
Or maybe you don't have enough.

383
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,748
Jennifer, come on.

384
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:32,292
Fuck you, Richard.

385
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,961
Jen!

386

(POP SONG PLAYING)

387
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,141
How's Ralphie? With you over him?

388
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,600
He busts balls.

389
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:53,397
He played like it was his idea
for me to be Aprile crew captain.

390
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:56,859
What is he gonna do?
Tony cut off his cazzi.

391
00:28:57,068 --> 00:29:01,113
Very prudently. Not that you
ain't gonna hear more later.

392
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:04,992
Most of the conversation
was about Johnny moving.

393
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,911
Ginny told Gabriella
she needs a big house.

394
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:12,124
Ginny Sacrimoni?
What she needs is her own zip code.

395
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:16,670
Jersey's a small state.
She moves in, she could tip it over.

396
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,756
I like something to grab onto.

397
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:22,342
You grab onto her,
your hands will disappear.

398
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:26,930
- She's so fat, her blood type is Ragú.
- When she goes camping...

399
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,807
...bears hide their food.

400
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:32,561
When Ginny hauls ass,
she's gotta make two trips.

401
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:36,648
Two guys could fuck her at
the same time and never meet.

402
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,567
Johnny!

403
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:42,154
- Fuck who?
- What?

404
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:43,864
What's so funny?

405
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:46,992
Nothing. We're just talking
about a girl.

406
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:50,037
Is that all you do,
is talk about cooze?

407
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:54,541
When we're not planting potatoes.
Welcome. You wanna drink?

408
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,628
I mean it.
You don't keep up with events?

409
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:00,464
- What?
- It's all over 1010 WINS.

410
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:04,218
It's right there in front of you.
Turn it up.

411
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:09,973
After years of planning and delays,
there's good news for Newark.

412
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:14,603
Coming from the Passaic River where
Assemblyman Ronald Zellman...

413
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:19,483
...held a press conference to
announce the release of $25 million...

414
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,944
...in state and federal funds.

415
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,404
25 million.

416
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:30,118
The time has come to return Newark
and its waterfront to its past glory.

417
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:35,165
By the year 2003, this long-neglected
stretch of riverfront...

418
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:39,920
...will be alive with condominiums,
film studios and public parks.

419
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,923
A self-perpetuating revenue base.

420
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:47,386
The $100 million Newark Museum
of Science and Trucking...

421
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:53,016
...will serve to make this the
attraction of the area and beyond.

422
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:57,938
This fucking busted valise,
he's worth every cent of his cut.

423
00:30:58,147 --> 00:31:00,774
Fucking dry wall contracts alone.

424
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,026
Thank you very much.

425
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:10,993
(KNOCKING)

426
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,622
Jen, can I come in?

427
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:23,672
I'm sorry.

428
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:29,386
I'm just so frustrated.

429
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,055
We both are.

430
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:36,894
I just want to go find that bastard
and kill him with my hands.

431
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:41,899
And I could and I would. But I can't.

432
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:46,194
They'd put me in jail,
that's how things are.

433
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:47,946
I know.

434
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:59,666
- You said Satriale's at 1.
- So now you know how it feels.

435
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:04,713
I know why I'm here and I apologize.
I won't let it happen again.

436

(AJ) Don't step in that, that's
my mother's flowers.

437
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:07,841

(MACHINE SOUNDS)

439
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:18,060
I asked you to
watch out for Jackie, Jr.

440
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:21,688
I said, "Don't let the kid
get involved in this."

441
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,359
I hear about a joint,
and Jackie's a part of it.

442
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:30,989
He only drove. I said I was sorry.
Let me tell you, he was an asset.

443
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:35,786
He pissed on the car seats,
but he handled himself very good.

444
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:38,622
You listening?
Leave him out of it.

445
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:42,960
He begged me for a taste.
He's the heir apparent.

446
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:47,339
I don't want him mixed up in this.
I promised his old man.

447
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:51,218
- But it's all right for me?
- I didn't say that.

448
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:56,264
What did you say? The life's good
for me, but not for Lord Fuckpants?

449
00:32:56,975 --> 00:33:01,853
Look, he's not suited to it.
He's not like you. Like us.

450
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:05,899
Kids today, they're bored,
they're spoiled.

451
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:13,240
- I promised his old man.
- What? You promised him what?

452
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,409
I don't know.

453
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:18,537
I was his best friend.

454
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:22,249
Don't bust my balls.

455
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:25,669
I gotta go make a stop in Nutley.

456
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:28,922
Come here.

457
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:36,555
I love you.

458
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:39,099
You're a good boy.

459
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:52,612
Lord Fuckpants? Whose moniker is that?

460
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,073
I'm not sure it is a moniker.

461

Hi. Come on in.

462
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:39,493
Jesus. What's the other guy look like?

463
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:54,925
That must have been some accident.
What happened?

464
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:58,929
Someone ran a stop sign on
Eisenhower Parkway.

465
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:03,517
- It was one of those things.
- I know a woman with one leg.

466
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:05,268
Terrible thing.

467
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:11,942
Last time we met we talked about
getting you into behavioral therapy.

468
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:15,904
I brought a couple of things
for you to look at.

469
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:23,453
"Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway."
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

470
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:29,626
The title leaves something
to be desired.

471
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,882
It's okay, it's just your...

472
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:40,262
It's okay. I'm sorry. Sorry.

473
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,889
You want me to?

474
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:47,561
- It startled me, that's all.
- Maybe you came back too soon.

475
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:51,022
- It's better for me to be busy.
- Right.

476
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:01,241
I'm okay. Really.

477
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,911
And I appreciate your concern.

478
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,255
That's what's wrong with the world.

479
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:18,466
An innocent person is minding
their own business...

480
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:22,429
...and some fucking asshole comes out
and smashes into them.

481
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:29,853
- You can't control everything.
- You can get pissed off.

482
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:32,939
And then what? Lose control?

483
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:36,067
You direct your
anger where it belongs.

484
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:37,986
You have panic attacks.

485
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:43,617
Panic occurs when feelings of anger,
revenge, whatever, overwhelm you.

486
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:47,204
That's where behavioral therapy
comes in.

487
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:51,082
It can teach you to control
those triggers.

488
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:56,963
How do you get people
to do what you want?

489
00:36:57,423 --> 00:37:00,884
You tell your mother it's
hers anytime she wants it.

490
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:05,597
- How was your cousin's shower?
- It sounded like a bunch of screaming.

491
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:09,726
I wondered whose Z24 was in
the driveway. You get a car?

492
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,519
Yeah.

493
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:14,898
Where did I put the sleeves
to that samovar?

494
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:20,946
- You want anything? A Coke?
- No, I'm set, Ton.

495
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:24,074
I heard Ralph Cifaretto
got passed over.

496
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,076
You heard about what? Who?

497
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:28,912
I'm saying that was probably smart.

498
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:33,291
- He's kind of a cool guy...
- That's none of your concern.

499
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:37,087
You were going to college.
I hear shit from Chris?

500
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:40,966
- You didn't talk to Chris. Shit.
