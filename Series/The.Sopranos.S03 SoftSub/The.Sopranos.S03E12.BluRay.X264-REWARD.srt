(OPERA MUSIC PLAYING)

3
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,194
Meadow, do you have a tampon?

4
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:55,948
I'm spotting and the dispenser is out.

5
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,784
You had an examination?

6
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:03,789
It's the middle of the month.
This never happens to me.

7
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,166
Here.

8
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:27,521
Imagine having your portrait
in a museum.

9
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:31,650
She's a rich merchant's wife.
It's how Rubens made money.

10
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:37,489
You talk the talk, Miss Art History.
I've never seen these grades from you.

11
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,200
Well, you take Intro to Semiotics.

12
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,079
If you spent less time
in Jackie's car...

13
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,497
Please.

14
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,458
That is so over.

15
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,753
Just like that? What happened?

16
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,869
Are you crying?

17
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,496
What's the matter?

18
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,374
I don't know. Just look at it.

19
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,888
"Jusepe de Ribera. The Mystical
Marriage of Saint Catherine."

20
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,140
That's the baby Jesus.

21
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,726
She's marrying a baby?
Good luck.

22
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,394
We all do.

23
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:53,607
- What?
- I shouldn't be sarcastic.

24
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,820
Just look at her.

25
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,407
The little baby's
hand against her cheek.

26
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,286
She's so at peace.

27
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:14,044
A beautiful, innocent,
gorgeous little baby.

28
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,057
Come on, let's go eat.

29
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:39,945
Tony!

30
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:44,324
Come on.
I'm sorry about what happened.

31
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:47,619
- You won't return my calls.
- Go fuck yourself.

32
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,121
Tony.

33
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:54,001
We have something too special
to just... over one argument.

34
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:58,797
One argument? You threw a fucking
dinner at my head, Gloria.

35
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:02,301
If you were a guy,
you know where you'd be.

36
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:06,138
But you were late.
You kept me waiting three hours...

37
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:10,726
What about the present?
You threw it into the Barnegat Bay.

38
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,644
All right, I...

39
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:21,028
I'm having a bad couple of weeks.
Shit with my family and other crap.

40
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:25,991
I was trying to act in control
and not dwell on it. It's no excuse.

41
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:30,746
- We can't talk about your problems?
- I didn't wanna bother you.

42
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,334
Well, I had a lot on my plate.

43
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,002
Can I see you later?

44
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,672
I'm late for my appointment.

(GIGGLING)

46
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:48,263
Me and this broad, we're like...

47
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,223
...leather and lace.

48
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,893
A burning ring of fire.
Whatever.

49
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,686
Amour fou.

50
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:57,773
As the French call it.

51
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,859
- Crazy love, all-consuming.
- That's it.

52
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:04,196
We push each other's buttons.

53
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:08,367
- Most people don't push your buttons.
- That's not true.

54
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:14,539
Now, I know you think I'm like a hard,
cold, captain-of-industry type.

55
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,875
That's not all there is.

56
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,712
I don't know.

57
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:26,593
She gets freaky.

58
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:30,305
Is she a full-blown
loop-do-loo or what?

59
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:33,975
- As you know, I cannot...
- Discuss another patient.

60
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,895
If I duke you a five?

61
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:40,732
I'm not charging you.
Last month you overpaid.

62
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,819
- You gave me good tips.
- I won't have it.

63
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:46,905
- Don't offer it again.
- All right. Jesus.

64
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,783
- Back to Gloria.
- She never wants money.

65
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,326
And you like this?

66
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:56,331
She's, you know, very
independent-minded. That I do like.

67
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,918
- You see her as independent, strong.
- She's not?

68
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:03,255
We're talking about your perceptions.

69
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,258
She made her own way in the world.

70
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,761
Irina was such
a helpless, fucking baby.

71
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,723
But Gloria knows a lot,
about a lot of shit.

72
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:17,602
Buddhism, and the movies...

73
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:22,441
She went to Morocco all by herself.

74
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,113
And those eyes.

75
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:32,451
Those dark, black eyes.

76
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:36,288
When she stares at you, it's like...

77
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:40,792
Like a Spanish princess
in one of those paintings. A Goya.

78
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,714
- Those eyes are deep.
- Complicated.

79
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,842
- Complicated? I said deep.
- You said dark.

80
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,512
Whenever I bring her up,
you get this weird puss.

81
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:56,016
You ask if she seems happy.
Like she's not.

82
00:07:56,184 --> 00:08:00,061
Or if she reminds me of somebody.
Like you don't like it.

83
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,814
Amo-fo, or whatever you call it.

84
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:07,903
You've told me what you see in Gloria.
What does she see in you?

85
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,571
Oh, please, huh?

86
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:13,158
What does she see in me?

87
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:18,997
With all the faggots and crybabies
around. Whatever else I am, I'm not...

88
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,918
I'm more of...

89
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,087
Well, you know, like I said...

90
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,298
Captain-of-industry type.

91
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,218
- You're a tough guy.
- Oh, come on.

92
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:32,844
You can say it.

93
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,930
You embarrass me with that.

94
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:38,266
Does Gloria know
what you do for a living?

95
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:39,726
You mentioned fire.

96
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:44,523
Can we say that certain kinds
of people are drawn to fire?

97
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:48,777
Looking for an inevitable result,
like a moth to a flame?

98
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:51,029
And this is Gloria?

99
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,241
And I'm the flame?

100
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:59,454
Why would anybody hit you,
of all people, with a side of beef?

101
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:00,914
She's complicated.

102
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:04,459
I said complicated. Dark, you said.

103
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,878
No, I said her eyes are dark.

104
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,550
Nice. Not bad.

106
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:18,390
Since we're kicking up...

107
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,309
...we were hoping you could,
you know...

108
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,353
...watch our back?

109
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,400
350 buys you "Hello."

110
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,777
Watching your back...

111
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:36,783
That's gonna require
a little more initiative on your part.

112
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,119
Oh, look at the face.

113
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,748
What's he got to be frowning about?

114
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,001
Tell me, Romeo.

115
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,670
Now that you moved home...

116
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:52,757
...you gonna be humping Tony
Soprano's girl on our couch?

117
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,259
Fuck her.

118
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:59,180
And Tony's stay-in-school shit. He
could have reached out to Rutgers.

119
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:03,435
He should break the dean's legs
because you won't read.

120
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:07,105
Now go ahead.
I gotta make some calls.

121
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,107
You did good.

122
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:10,900
Keep coming by.

123
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,112
Go. Go.

124
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:30,170
I knew a Moroccan guy once.
He hit and ran me. I tracked him down.

125
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,422
I never forget a face.

126
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:38,928
Jesus Christ!
That's the oldest joke in the book.

127
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,306
Jesus Christ!

128
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:42,974
Hello?

129
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,935
No, you have the wrong number.

130
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,981
What?

131
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,736
I thought it might be my sister.

132
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:57,989
That family shit
you were telling me about?

133
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:03,495
It's okay if you don't wanna talk
about it. Really.

134
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:07,874
She said I can never see
my niece and nephew again.

135
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:14,422
- Right before Christmas.
- We had a new Santa at our party.

136
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,175
- Wasn't good.
- I love those children.

137
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,760
So much.

138
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,764
She said I turned them
against their dad. I didn't.

139
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:27,352
Not that he doesn't deserve it.
Fucking crackhead sack of shit.

140
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:32,524
Hannah and Seamus go to this
alternative, private...

141
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,235
...elementary school in Santa Monica.

142
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:39,114
- Where it's all about self-esteem.
- I hate that shit.

143
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:44,202
I ask Hannah, she's a third-grader,
"Will you be in the Christmas play?"

144
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:48,289
And she says,
"We call it the Winter Festival."

145
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:52,711
So I go, "Whatever."
I don't say anything.

146
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,796
And then Seamus says:

147
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:59,050
"We can't say Christmas.
We call Christmas 'the C-word."'

148
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,720
And I fucking flipped out.

149
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,435
- What did Seamus say?
- What the fuck does he know? He's 10.

150
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,896
So my sister gets mad
because her husband...

151
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:16,776
...teaches there, except he's
on leave for drug abuse treatment.

152
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:19,487
And one thing led to another and...

153
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:23,116
She said I always had it in for John.

154
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:27,787
- And she forbid me to see them again.
- He smokes crack?

155
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,292
Without those two kids...

156
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:43,470
Maybe we'll all get lucky.
The way these trucks go by out here?

157
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:46,931
- Maybe I'll get plastered on a grill.
- What?

158
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:50,101
I'm just kidding. It never rains.

159
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:53,438
I think they're gonna fire me
over at Globe.

160
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:59,569
Fucking Arnie Mills sexually harasses
me and then dares me to sue.

161
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,780
Anyway.

162
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,698
Fuck them.

163
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,869
- You like this song?
- It's okay.

164
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,706
- I love this song.
- Yeah?

Go find a fucking Taco Bell
before I cap your asses.

175
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,361
Get the fuck out of here.

176
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,910
- Oh, shit. Take this.
- Fuck, no. He's a made guy.

177
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:35,540
He'll flip when he sees this shit.
Roy's his aunt's cousin.

178
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:39,752
- What's up?
- Hey, Christopher.

179
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,881
- What the fuck happened?
- Ask your buddy.

180
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:47,552
Spics disrespected the place.
I had to straighten them out.

181
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,805
- Had to straighten them out. How many?
- Three.

182
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:53,892
- Goddamn fucking craziness.
- You all right?

183
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:59,063
Twenty years I'm collecting these.
What the fuck, it's only glass.

185
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:12,493
- How's business? Making money?
- Doing all right.

186
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:16,414
- Why, got something?
- My favorite. A truck. Cigarettes.

187
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:20,126
Sounds good.
But we're kind of with Ralphie now.

188
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,795
Besides, wouldn't Tony go ballistic?

189
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,923
Unless they're paying you...

190
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:28,468
...nobody can tell anybody
how to earn a living.

191
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:32,013
- Finally. Thank you.
- Ralphie, huh?

192
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:37,769
Well, if you ever think about
jumping ship, you know my number.

193
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,612
I need the paperwork
on the preowned C5.

194
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,114
- Mrs. Soprano?
- Yes?

195
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:55,870
The courtesy van's stuck in traffic.
It should only be maybe 20 minutes.

196
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:59,165
Well, you know,
maybe I'll just call a cab.

197
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:02,794
Jerry, I'll give her a lift.
I'm going out anyway.

198
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,797
- Gloria Trillo.
- Carmela Soprano. You don't mind?

199
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,466

let me grab a demo.

200
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,844

Don't believe it.
Everybody is a potential sale.

202
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:20,853
- So, what do you do?
- I'm a homemaker.

203
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,021
Oh.

204
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:26,317
You must make a very nice home
to drive a Benz.

205
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:30,697
- So you're married?
- Yes.

206
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,033
- Kids?
- Two. You?

207
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,412
No. To both.

208
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,164
Boys? Girls?

209
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,833
One boy, one girl.

210
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:46,337
The boy is still in high school
and my daughter's in college.

211
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:53,344
She's not too far away though.

212
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,306
She's in New York City.

213
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:03,896
- She's at Columbia.
- School of Broadcasting?

214
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:08,526
The university. It's in the Ivy
League, one of the top schools.

215
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,904
- I know. I was just kidding.
- Oh.

216
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:13,948
Right.

217
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,576
Boy, these kids today.

218
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,537
They got the world
by the you-know-what.

219
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,789
Yeah, tell me about it.

220
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:26,127
At least your daughter doesn't
need a man for success.

221
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:27,879
Thank God.

222
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:33,134
- That's a beautiful ring.
- Thank you.

223

- What does your husband do?
- He's in a few businesses.

224
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:41,642
- Sounds mysterious.
- No, no, it's not, really.

- No problem. It was nice to meet you.
- You too.

229

- Nice house.
- Thank you.

00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:23,101
I tell you, the thing I like
about Moltisanti?

231
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:27,105
He'll even tell Tony Soprano
to go fuck himself.

232
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,940
The guy's fearless.

233
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:30,483
Who's fearless?

234
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:33,486
Chris Moltisanti.
Where's my mother?

235
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,947
She's an early riser.

236
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,158
What about Moltisanti?

237
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:43,121
We were saying he's young
to be made. That kind of shit.

238
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:47,291
He wanted it
so he stepped up and took it.

239
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,338
Like your dad and Tony Soprano.
Know how they made their names?

240
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:55,174
- How?
- We got any marshmallows?

241
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,844
Come on, what about my father?

242
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:06,310
When we was kids,
we had our own little crew.

like the sixth family.

But who knew we was even alive?

248
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:29,083
Till one fucking night.

249
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:32,003
And I gotta give your father credit.

250
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:37,049
He had balls as big
as an Irish broad's ass.

251
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,011
There was this old...

252
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,346
...old mustache named...

253
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:45,558
...Feech Lamanna.

254
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,687
What Feech meant,
who the fuck knows?

255
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:54,066
But he was made on the other side,
so he was an original.

256

He was an O.G.

257

Whatever.

258
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:03,117
He had this Saturday night
card game...

259
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:07,246
...and your father sees a chance
to rise to the A-league.

260
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:12,376
Connected or not, him,
me and Tony were gonna rob him.

We thought your father lost a marble.

262

- But he said, "Fuck it."
- Balls.

263
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,801

264
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:24,388

walked away with 20 large.

I'm still sick over it.

268
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:36,776
I caught the clap from some
hippie broad I was fucking.

269
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:40,446
My dick was dripping
like a busted pipe.

270
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,407
Anyways, the rest is history.

271
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:48,621
Your father and Tony was on the
fast track to being made, and I...

272
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:52,416
...was still a little shit here,
like the two of you.

273

And of course I, whatever...
But that was a few years later.

- They get away with it?
- What could Feech do?

275
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,009
There was a sit-down.

276
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:05,805
And the right people
got some of their money back...

277
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,808

Oh, Jackie.

Rinse those plates before you put
them in the dishwasher. It clogs.

344
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:18,224
- What if they find out it's us?
- We want them to.

345
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:20,851
Not right away,
but like Ralph said.

346
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:24,188
When they do, you know
it's gonna get squashed.

347
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,232
My old man was Jackie Aprile.

348
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:29,568
The worse that'll happen,
we give some back.

349
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,612
We pull this off...

350
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:37,076
...we're like free agents.
We dictate the terms, not them.

351
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:40,037
Because we show balls.

352
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,373
Come on, call Carlo.

353
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:52,049
Fuck. There's no signal.

354
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:56,220
I'd have to be pretty stupid
to write a book about killing...

355
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,138
Use that phone.

356
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,392
Oh, yeah, this one.

357
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,728
Come on, hurry up, call Carlo.

358
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:09,275
- They show my favorite part yet?
- I think it's coming up.

359
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:10,985
The answer's no.

360
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:19,785
- Dude, move over. Give me some room.
- Fuck you, it's my house.

361
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,663
Here it comes.

362
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:24,582
Yeah.

363
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,751
Like a cigarette, Nick?

364
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:38,178
- You two know each other?
- No.

365
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:46,854
I saw a psychiatrist. That's why
Father Intintola said we should talk.

366
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:50,816
He said you were getting
a doctorate in psychiatry.

367
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:52,026
Psychology.

368
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:57,406
The psychiatrist told me my
whole life is a lie, and he's right.

369
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,285
And now I think I'm sick.

370
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:06,165
And if I die, I will never
be with God in eternity.

371
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:10,127
- You're ill?
- I think I have ovarian cancer.

372
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:14,465
- What does the doctor say?
- I haven't seen one.

373
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:16,967
I'm afraid.

374
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:22,389
- Why do you think you are ill?
- I'm spotting. Lower back pain.

375
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:28,145
My hormones are all over the place.
My cousin Kathy died from it.

376
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:32,358
God doesn't punish people
for mistakes that they've made.

377
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:35,486
He loves you more than you know.

378
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:41,158
Have you thought, with your symptoms,
you might be with child?

379
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,494
I know, that's another...

380
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:49,249
Would you be more comfortable
if we set this sacrament aside...

381
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:52,336
...and stepped into my office?

382
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:02,513
(CHURCH BELLS RINGING)

383
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:11,021
The psychiatrist said
I should leave my husband.

384
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:14,942
When he said that, it seemed so right.

385
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:19,863
You made a sacred vow.
Divorce is out of the question.

386
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:24,284
Unless...
Is he abusive, your husband?

387
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,870
Not to me. But he is unfaithful.

388
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:30,374
He's a good man basically, but...

389
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:35,295
I talked to Father Intintola
years ago, and here I am.

390
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:38,382
- Do you love your husband?
- I do.

391
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:42,511
I love my husband.
And I love God.

392
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,223
But my life is financed by crime.

393
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,226
His crime.

394
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:54,565
Fifty thousand dollars
to my daughter's college.

395
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:58,318
The psychiatrist says
it's all blood money.

396
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,655
Now, to maybe bring another child
into this?

397
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:07,244
God understands that we all live
in the middle of tensions.

398
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:11,081
You say your husband has good in him.

399
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:16,253
What you have to do is learn to live
on what the good part earns.

400
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:18,130
The what?

401
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,595
There is a point inside yourself.

402
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:29,808
An inner boundary beyond which
you feel culpable.

403
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:33,812
You've got to come to an awareness
of where that line is.

404
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:37,608
And forego those things
which lay without it.

405
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:42,613
- The Church has changed so much.
- It's a complex world.

406
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:49,787
Learn to live on the good part.
Forego those things that lay without it.

407
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:56,126
I think I can do that, Father.

408
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,378
I'll try.

409
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:01,882
And go see an ob-gyn.

410
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,681
This mad-cow disease.

411
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:13,977
It's terrible the English government
didn't tell people.

412
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:17,105
Maybe they didn't wanna
create a stampede.

413
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,568
Oh, by the way...

414
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:26,698
...guess which former medical student
no longer dates the Queen of Mean.

415
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:28,492
You're kidding.

416
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:34,122
- Jackie Jr. and Meadow are finished?
- Frankly, I am delighted.

417
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:39,586
Kevin told Angie Bonpensiero
that Jackie was smoking marijuana.

418
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:43,882
- And was caught cheating at Rutgers.
- Gee, that bad?

419
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:46,552
That black kid would've been better.

420
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:51,014
He's got a 4.0 and he's moving
to India for the U.N.

421
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:53,350
- I told you.
- That's my fault.

422
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:57,145
She wasted three months
with Jackie Jr.

423
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:01,024
- Hello.
- Mrs. Soprano!

424
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:04,444
- Gloria Trillo, Globe Motors.
- Hi, how are you?

425
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:08,365
I hope this is a good time.
The new E-320 just came in.

426
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,409
You might wanna take a look.

427
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:14,955
No, I don't think so.
I still have another year on my lease.

428
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:17,541
Maybe your husband will treat you.

429
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,210
Maybe I will.
Thank you for calling.

430
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,754
Okay, bye. Hope to see you!

431
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:24,381
Bye-bye.

432
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:29,261
Well, what a nice woman.

433
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:30,637
Who?

434
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:34,182
Just some saleswoman
from Globe Motors.

435
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:38,979
What?

436
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:45,485
She wants me to try the new wagon.
I'm not interested, but she was nice.

437
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:48,822
She took me home
while they serviced the wagon.

438
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:52,743
I should hold onto it another year,
don't you think?

439
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:55,412
Another year.

440
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,581
Yeah.

441
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:11,011
I was just wondering
if we could switch days off.

442
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,847
- Give me a minute.
- We could switch...

443
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:16,975
I got a customer coming in, all right?
Tony.

444
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:27,152
Are you out of your fucking mind,
talking to my wife?

445
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:32,991
I was upset about your ex-girlfriend.
I thought you should see my version.

446
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,454
I'm sorry, all right?

447
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:40,332
You drove her home. What the fuck?

448
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44,127
Then you look right into my eyes
and don't tell me?

449
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:51,343
It's normal to be curious about
someone you love's significant others.

450
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:54,638
- It's not. It's fucking twisted.
- It is not.

451
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,057
I don't wanna argue.
You're upset.

452
00:32:57,266 --> 00:33:00,894
I know it's on the margins
for someone like you...

453
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:03,230
...and it'll never happen again.

454
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:04,648
No shit.

455
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:10,404
You can tell your shrink
you ruined eight relationships.

456
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:14,700
- What do you mean?
- It's fucking over.

457
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:16,660
Tony!

458
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:21,289
You see, Tuesday I can take my kid
to hear Raffi.

459
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,835
Left ovary.

460
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,509
Right ovary.

461
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:37,389
Just tell me right out.
Don't mince words.

462
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:40,684
I didn't like people
knowing my personal life.

463
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:44,187
Where is this asshole now?
What did he have, one song?

465
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:47,691
- What?
- We should do what we gotta do.

466
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:51,278
- Call Carlo.
- Who the fuck was Feech Lamanna?

467
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,864
You know what? Don't come.

468
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:58,744
You wanna spend your life with
your head up your ass, be my guest.

469
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:06,209
- How's your calamari salad?
- He's not using the right olive oil.

470
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:10,422
- You haven't said two words, Carmela.
- Sorry.

471
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:16,219
- I came from Dr. Rotelli's.
- Everything all right?

472
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:19,723
I've never been better.
Just a thyroid thing.

473
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:23,060
- Thank God.
- I thought I was pregnant.

474
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:25,479
Bite your tongue. At our age?

475
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:28,315
With the kids growing up and all...

476
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:32,778
I want a grandchild. Terry
and her husband are trying, but...

477
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:36,448
Speaking of kids, I am sick
about Jackie and Meadow.

478
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:39,576
I ask, he tells me
to mind my own business.

479
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,912
- So does she.
- They broke up?

480
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,123
Is Meadow okay?

481
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:48,919
She's so different than I was.
It rolls off her back.

482
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:53,590
- No weight loss or sleepless nights.
- Not like what we go through.

483
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,759
Because we married them.

484
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:59,971
It's not just us.
The president of the United States...

485
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:03,975
His wife put up with the
blowjobs and the stained dress.

486
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:06,520
Hillary Clinton? I can't stand her.

487
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:09,940
We could all take a page
from her book.

488
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:13,318
To be publicly humiliated
and go around smiling?

489
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:18,532
That is so false. I would dig a hole,
climb into it and not come out.

490
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:22,953
All I know is, she stuck by him,
put up with the bullshit...

491
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,789
...and she set up
her own little thing.

492
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:31,002
She took all that negative shit
he gave her and spun it into gold.

493
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:33,547
You gotta give her credit.

494
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,633
Well, that's true, isn't it?

495
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:40,470
She's a role model for all of us.

496
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,686
No, the case is still pending.

497
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:53,525
They could try me on mail and wire
fraud, but they want a major RICO.

498
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,820
Tony. Line two.

499
00:35:56,988 --> 00:36:01,825
- Who is it?
- It's a woman. I think she's crying.

00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,747

00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:15,505

I'm sorry. There's no one else
I can talk to.

I'm a grown man. I've had other women.

Nobody cares if I'm alive or dead!

I didn't just meet you.

and walk away.

Now, you listen to me.

But, hey, the decision
goes the other way?

684
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:44,647
The one thing you cannot do, Ralph,
you cannot do...

685
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:47,149
...is blame yourself.

686
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:50,987
You took this kid under your wing.

687
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:54,281
You schooled him as best you could.

688
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:56,575
Didn't you?

689
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,792
Jack spoiled him.

690
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:08,170
I think this is yours.

691
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:13,175
The stupid kid was carrying it around
during the holidays.

692
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:53,883
She wanted me to fucking kill her.

693
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:56,093
Like suicide by cop.

694
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:58,929
So she set me up?

695
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:02,308
She saw me as only a fucking hammer?

696
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:04,226
She loved you.

697
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:09,899
She looked so good too,
that day in your office.

698
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:15,112
Just another Irina
with a college degree.

699
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:16,781
Ask yourself.

700
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:22,995
How did you recognize in Gloria,
under her layers of sophistication...

701
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:28,584
...this deeply wounded, angry being
that would let you replicate...

702
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:31,420
...your relationship
with your mother?

703
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:35,758
I don't wanna fuck my mother.
You're never gonna convince me.

704
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:37,510
Not fuck.

705
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:39,929
Try to please her.

706
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:41,931
Try to win her love.

707
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:44,266
Forty fucking years old.

708
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:48,604
We need to repeat what's familiar,
even if it's bad for us.

709
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:51,941
Gloria's need for drama.

710
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:56,320
The selfishness.
The incessant self-regard.

711
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:58,948
At one time...

712
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:02,618
...in your mother's hands,
it passed for love.

713
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:07,623
All right, look. You're her doctor.
You tell me.

714
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:10,126
Do I gotta worry about this broad?

715
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:13,129
She says she's gonna
tell Carmela about us.

716
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:15,923
I honestly can't predict.

717
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:19,635
We should deal with...

718
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:23,639
...why are you so attracted
to dangerous relationships?

719
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:26,851
Why do you put your marriage
in such danger?

720
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:32,064
- Maybe I'm looking for a way out.
- Anthony.

721
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:36,694
- You'll never leave your wife.
- Bullshit. There's a limit.

722
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:40,156
She might leave you,
but you'll never leave her.

723
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:44,660
Despite your mothering...

724
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:49,582
...you made one good decision
in your life vis--vis women.

725
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:51,834
You won't throw that over.

726
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:55,921
Your own selfishness is too strong
to let that happen.

727
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:58,007
All right. All right.

728
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:04,013
Actually, in spite of everything
you're a very conventional man.

729
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,764
I said all right.

730
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:08,851
We have to stop now.

731
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:26,619
- Got pep, I'll give it that.
- Zero to 60 in under seven seconds.

732
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:40,049
What's the matter, you don't like me?

733
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:48,515
I'm not back, they call the cops,
standard operating procedure.

734
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:53,646
Here's standard operating procedure.
Stay away from Tony Soprano.

735
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:57,942
Shut the fuck up and listen.
It's over, capisce?

736
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:00,402
Over and done.

737
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:04,990
You call or go anywhere near him
or his family...

738
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:09,578
...and they'll be scraping your
nipples off these leather seats.

739
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:12,164
And here's the point to remember.

740
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:17,169
My face is the last one you'll see.
Not Tony's.

741
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:20,172
We understand each other?

742
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:23,425
It won't be cinematic.

743
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:38,357

(POP SONG PLAYING)

745
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:47,449
Any word, anything?

746
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:50,828
He probably went down to Florida.

747
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:54,206
Ro, I'm sure he's fine.

748
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:56,625
Ro, come on.

749
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:01,338
Sit down.

(SOBBING)

751
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:11,724
Look.

752
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:16,729
- This will be hard for you to hear.
- Jesus Christ!

753
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:20,357
No, it's okay. It's okay, it's just...

754
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:25,237
...he has a very serious drug problem.

755
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:26,655
What?

756
00:55:28,366 --> 00:55:32,328
It's coke.
He may owe some money to dealers.

757
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:37,499
- Oh, my God.
- I didn't wanna tell you.

758
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:40,878
Look, we're doing everything we can.

759
00:55:45,925 --> 00:55:47,676
We're gonna find him.

760
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:49,928
We'll get him help.

761
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:52,514
We'll get him to rehab.

762
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:59,063
Let's just hope he's not too far gone.

(POP SONG PLAYING)

764
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:25,672
Something smells good.

765
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:30,719
Lemon snaps for the
bake sale at church.

766
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:42,064
You look good.

767
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:45,484
I went to step today.

768
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:51,990
Is that why you don't have these
looney-tune moods when you exercise?

769
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:56,578
Where's your ring?

770
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:03,252
I had to get it sized.
It's a little big.

(OVEN TIMER GOING OFF)

Hi, it's me. I'll be home
in about twenty minutes.

Yeah, I picked up the stuffed shells.
