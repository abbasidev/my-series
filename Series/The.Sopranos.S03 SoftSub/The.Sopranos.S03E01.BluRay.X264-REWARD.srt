(SOPRANOS THEME SONG)

2
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:32,192
(PUSSY) So how's your mom, Ton?
(TONY) Same.

3
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:38,323
But my ex-goomar's cousin, I got her
to take care of her. Russian girl.

4
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:43,495
Who was telling me the Bevilaqua
kid has money from construction?

5
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:48,208
- Fucking Matthew was never any good.
- He sure cried like a baby.

6
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:51,879
I think the family was relieved
he got taken out.

7
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,797
What are you gonna eat?

8
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,716
Hey, waiter!

(STOPPING TAPE)

10
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:03,015
That's the closest CW16 got Tony
to discussing the Bevilaqua murder?

11
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:07,936
I think at this point it's time
to consider 16, Bonpensiero, compost.

12
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:13,942
Bonpensiero was crucial
to the Webistics stock fraud case.

13
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,278
So RICO-wise...

14
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:20,532
...the airline tickets,
mail and wire fraud...

15
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:23,452
...if the mother testifies
for immunity.

16
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:26,121
Whose own mother's gonna testify?

17
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:29,833
I say focus on his garbage business.

18
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:34,922
- Extortion. Interstate trucking.
- It'll yield a prosecutable murder.

19
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,760
Richie Aprile, no doubt about it,
the cartel had him whacked.

20
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:43,931
But Tony shows diligence
when it comes to debugging.

21
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:49,353
- What about the home?
- They talked in the basement.

22
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:53,232
His own basement?
Where's the due diligence there?

23
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,567
Tony avoids business at home.

24
00:03:55,777 --> 00:04:01,114
He'll take somebody out by the pool.
Except there he fears parabolics.

25
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:07,579
The basement has noisy AC ducts.
He turns on the air and he feels safe.

26
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:14,086
"Surreptitiously enter and leave."
A "sneak and peek" warrant.

27
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:17,589
- Correct.
- I said you could enter the basement.

28
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,592
Do we have to impact
this family's privacy?

29
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:25,097
First we determine
where to best place the wire.

30
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:30,435
Then the listening device
will be fabricated and we install it.

31
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:34,356
See that they limit both
entrances to the basement.

32
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,943
It's not a
Better Homes and Gardens tour.

33
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,946
Happy hunting.

34
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:58,463
(TONY) You know, the coffeemaker's
got to be plugged in for it to work!

35
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:02,259
Same time as yesterday.

36
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,767
I'm just going to the stationery store.

37
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,855
I'll be right back.
You don't gotta follow me. All right?

39
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:23,196
To drop a wire there's got to be
nobody home for at least two hours.

40
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,158
The maid is gone
on Tuesday afternoons.

41
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:29,953
- Why?
- Classes to get her U.S. citizenship.

42
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,664
She's gone from 1 till about 2:45.

43
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:36,668
Class, then she and
her husband have lunch.

44
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:39,880
He's applying for citizenship too.

45
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:42,466
What's his name again?

46
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:47,888
- Stasiu Wosilius.
- I'll run that by Anti-Terrorism.

47
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,807
Carmela's gone on Tuesday. Tennis.

48
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:56,188
We need somebody on her and everybody
that's got a key to the house.

49
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,190
Daughter's at Columbia.

50
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,486
Why risk it? She's 45 minutes away.
Put somebody on her.

51
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:07,699
Anyone breaks for home, we need
to warn the team to get the hell out.

I had him darn it in the shoulder,

- Beautiful coat.

- What the fuck? Lunch is ready.
- I wash my hands.

69
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:40,954
- You washed your hands.
- I tied my shoe.

70

- So what?
- I can't stand touching shoelaces.

71
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:49,212
Ever tie your shoes and notice
the ends of your laces are wet?

72
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:53,758
- From what? Why would they be wet?
- I got no fucking idea.

- You stand at the urinals...
- Come on, will you?

He's asking, I'm telling.
It's important.

and you don't touch the shoe.

A men's shithouse is a sewer.

- Philly.

- We started off at Smoke's, as usual.

at this place, Ruby Foo's...

- Frosh Week. What do they expect?

- I'll study now.
- I have a bio lab. I haven't read it.

- Still miss New Jersey?
- It's only, like, half an hour away.

It's just this transition.
It's a lot of work.

175
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:18,971
New York is an experience
that unalterably changes a person.

- And all this freedom of college.

Oh.

go up there. But, no, we're fine.

if everything's okay over there?

- Probably you should.

- Pardon?

Nothing. They're different.

For this neighborhood,
they're different, that's all.

- Well, we'll get busy in the back.
- Thanks.

324
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:53,553
- Still nothing out of the ordinary.
- Is the kid home sick?

I don't see him. I see an arm,
piece of robe...

Big John's okay with a 60-40 split
because we own the building.

331
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:25,419
- What the hell?
- What?

332
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:34,553
The fuck? Is that Pat Parisi?

333
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,473
Oh, shit!

334
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:45,605
What should we do?

335
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:58,368
He's drunk!

336
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:01,997
- I told John, "Look..."
- Let's talk downstairs.

337
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,926
Motherfucker.

338
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,639
I don't understand this at all.

Cocksucker.

340
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:43,121
What's up, Ike?

341
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:48,126
What happened at the Soprano house
was, the heater blew.

342
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:52,172
Our unit saw Ruggerio
haul the old one out.

343
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:56,259
- Ruggerio. A plumber?
- Why?

344
00:34:57,053 --> 00:35:00,555
My sister was friends
with Mrs. Ruggerio.

345
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:05,018
Yeah, that's Mr. Ruggerio's
neighborhood.

346
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:09,022
We have to get it in
before our warrant goes stale.

347
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:14,194
Boy, we've had every one of Tony's
phones bugged for four years.

348
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:19,699
- The guy says less than Harpo Marx.
- Next Tuesday the wire drop's a go.

349
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:27,749

- Wire drop is still a go.
- Confirming access to switching box.

357
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:04,161
The teacher knows nothing.

358
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:09,291
Why do you quarrel with him always?
English is his first language...

359
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:15,338
He waste our time with those
trick questions. "Stop. Men at work."

360
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:19,926
How do we know it doesn't mean,
"Stop all men who are working"?

361
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,596
He shouldn't have taken a point.

362
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:26,600
He thinks I'm a hack cabbie
from Pakistan.

363
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:32,397
- Please, where are you going?
- I'm going back to work!

364
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,577
- Excuse me?
- You scared me.

365
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:49,706
Sorry. Is the West Essex
Language School around here?

366
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:53,460
- There.
- Is it coed?

367
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:57,255
- What?
- You wouldn't happen to be Polish?

368
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,591
Yes.

369
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:03,220
That's... My grandmother is Polish.

370
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,774
It's locked today.

371
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:21,947
- Yes?
- My grandmother...

372
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:25,825
Excuse me. How can I help you, sir?

373
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:32,582
I was wondering if I could ask
you about the school. How is it?

374
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:37,295
Sweet mother of Jesus!
Look at her today.

375
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,806
Hi, Ade!

376
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:50,392
Hi, guys. Be back in a second.

377
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:53,895
Listen to this now. "Hi, Ade!"

378

Hi!

379
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:58,942
- Hi.
- Hey, you.

380
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:03,780
- I love those.
- Yeah?

381
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:05,740
Oh, my God.

382
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:08,535
- Where'd you get them?
- Near my house.

383
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,746
Ay-Ay-Ay.

384
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:24,426
- This table's been moved.
- From the flood.

385
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:28,346
It's not under the duct anymore.
Should we move it?

386
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:34,185
- Two, three feet? Who's gonna notice?
- No, wait. Somebody might.

387
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:40,233
But normal course of events,
Tony will assume Carmela moved it back.

388
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:44,154
- If anybody even notices.
- Make an executive decision.

389
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:48,450
- Grab an end.
- Easy.

390
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:52,245
When she heard I was deferring,
she's like, "That's sketchy."

391
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:55,457
Are you serious?

392
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:59,044
Eric Scatino hates Montclair.
He's doing acid.

393

- I haven't had any alcohol in a week.
- I know.

400
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:30,200
I was gonna say we should go to
Panchito's, then I remembered. Bad idea.

401
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:35,288
- I went to the health center.
- For that problem swallowing?

402
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,957
They gave me BuSpar.

403
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,710
That's for anxiety, right?

404
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,754
I guess.

405
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:46,549
There was this weight lifter
on the subway.

406
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:53,014
He was eating chicken parts and
spitting bones back in the container.

407
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:56,142
And the whole car reeked.

408
00:39:56,352 --> 00:40:01,398
This blind man sitting next to him,
you could tell he felt invaded.

- What, Ton?
