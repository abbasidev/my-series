1
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,400
I want to look my best...

2
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,000
for David.

3
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,520
The defence rests on a
single word... provocation.

4
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,600
And we all know that's risky.

5
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,720
Not a single applicable precedent
in an English murder trial.

6
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,880
Blakely beat Ruth
black and blue.

7
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,440
He humiliated her, took her
for every penny she had.

8
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,840
I believe, if we can show
that, then this isn't murder.

9
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,160
It's manslaughter.

10
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,800
You must get the
Crown's witnesses

11
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,560
to reveal what they
know... like Cussen,

12
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,800
who by all rights should
be a-a witness for defence.

13
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,200
They may have got
to him, somehow,

14
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,040
may have some rabbit in a hat.

15
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,200
You must push him in the cross.

16
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,120
Well, if that's
all, Mr. Bickford.

17
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,720
Ruth, this is Mr. Stevenson,
QC, Lead Counsel.

18
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,240
He'll take you through
the defence strategy.

19
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,600
I just want those malicious
snobs to pay for what they did.

20
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,240
Malicious snobs?

21
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,080
The Findlaters.

22
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,880
If it weren't for them,
David would still be alive.

23
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,640
Dr. Whittaker's theory...

24
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,080
the effects of jealousy
on hysterical women.

25
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,360
I think we should lean on it.

26
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,120
Ruth isn't hysterical.

27
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,160
She shot Blakely because
he was unfaithful.

28
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,480
You heard her... her
anger at the Findlaters

29
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,560
because they tried to
tempt him with other women.

30
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,440
She was consumed
by sexual jealousy,

31
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,760
which provoked her
uncontrollably to murder.

32
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,960
She was provoked by
Blakely's violence.

33
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,480
She'd miscarried a child.

34
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,920
She has hardly mentioned that.

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,560
Because she's traumatised.

36
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,200
It's a question of what
the jury will understand.

37
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,880
You should never have
let her bleach her hair.

38
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,280
Does she look like a
beaten woman to you?

39
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,240
Blonde tart!

40
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,080
Ooh! God, hold it still,
for Christ's sake!

41
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,600
Oi! Stop looking
up her skirt, you!

42
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,120
- Vicki!!
- Hello.

43
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,200
- Hello.
- Hello.

44
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,160
What do you think?
A bit vulgar?

45
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,200
Bloody ridiculous. I love it.

46
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,576
Been reading all about
you in the gossip columns.

47
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,960
Oh, yes, snotty
bastards can't believe

48
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,880
a girl from Staines
could marry a prince.

49
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,440
There's a revolution
coming, girls.

50
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:16,000
Class and what school you went
to... no one'll give a toss,

51
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,880
long as you know how
to have a good time.

52
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,400
Look at you and David.

53
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,520
- Oh, yes, huh?
- Ooh!

54
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,040
Mm. What's he doing here?

55
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,120
He's restful, compared to David.

56
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,440
Hm.

57
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,080
One of those who
just wants a cuddle?

58
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,536
It's not like that.
We haven't actually...

59
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,240
He probably follows
you upstairs,

60
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,040
watches through a
crack in the door.

61
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,800
- Creepy old bastard.
- Stop! Shh! You're terrible!

62
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,040
Someone's coming up.

63
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,480
- Ooh!
- That'll be David. Alright.

64
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,120
Everyone, positions, quickly!

65
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:48,240
Mrs. Ellis is a woman
of 28, divorced,

66
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,080
and the story you are
going to hear is this...

67
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,240
that in 1954 and 1955,

68
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,800
she was having simultaneous
love affairs with two men,

69
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,800
David Blakely, the deceased,
and another man called Cussen,

70
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,040
whom I shall call before you.

71
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,680
Blakely was trying to
break off the connexion,

72
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,000
and the accused woman
was angry at this,

73
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,520
even though she had
another lover at the time.

74
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,720
She therefore took a loaded gun,

75
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:25,400
found David, and shot him by
emptying that revolver at him.

76
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:33,920
Now, you are not here in the
least concerned with adultery

77
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
or sexual misconduct.

78
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,320
You are not trying
her for immorality...

79
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,400
but for murder.

80
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,680
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

81
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,560
Oh, aren't you sweet?

82
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,600
I'm so sorry, darling.

83
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,200
David asked me to let you
know he can't make it.

84
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,560
He's tied up with work.

85
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,120
Well, it's about time
he bloody did some. Hmm?

86
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,960
More cake for us.

87
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,480
Oh, darling. Look, I'm sorry.

88
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,960
I'm sure if he'd realised
the effort you'd gone to...

89
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,440
We both know he's not
working. Were you with him?

90
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,400
Of course not.

91
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,600
Look, David's engaged to
be married to Mary Dawson.

92
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,840
He's been living here
with me for months.

93
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,280
You've been a lovely
friend to him.

94
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,720
Bless you.

95
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,440
The prosecution
calls Desmond Cussen.

96
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,680
Give you a hand clearing up?

97
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:49,720
You had known the
accused, Mrs. Ellis,

98
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,640
for around two years?

99
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,400
Did you become a
close friend of hers?

100
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,720
Yes.

101
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,360
You will not mind if
we use plain words.

102
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,440
Were you her lover?

103
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,160
For a short time, yes.

104
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,880
On Sunday, the tenth of April,
the day of the alleged murder,

105
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,640
did she and her son
spend most of the day

106
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,040
at your flat with you?

107
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,080
Yes.

108
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:25,400
That evening, did you drive
her back to Egerton Gardens?

109
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,840
Yes.

110
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,680
About what time?

111
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,320
Er, about 7:30.

112
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,120
About 7:30 on
the Sunday night,

113
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,240
and that is the
last you saw of her?

114
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,040
Yes.

115
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,960
Thank you.

116
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,360
They're trying to convict
her of immorality.

117
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,640
That's why they've
called Cussen.

118
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,600
They want the jury to
see it in the flesh.

119
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,200
He instructed them not to
consider sexual misconduct.

120
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,640
And that's why he raised
it, to draw attention to it.

121
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,800
Mr. Stevenson?

122
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,960
Mr. Cussen...

123
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,040
were you very much in love
with this young woman?

124
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,320
Yes.

125
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,280
At the time, you were
begging the defendant

126
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,000
to marry you if she could?

127
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,760
Do you need to go to her?

128
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,560
George wants to take her.

129
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,720
George, your husband?

130
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,800
Some rich, childless colleague
of his, a woman dentist,

131
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,720
wants Georgina to go
and live with her...

132
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,920
wants to adopt her.

133
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,200
George says he'll give me
a divorce if I say yes.

134
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:12,360
You don't need to give
up your child, Ruth.

135
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,440
Let me look after you all.

136
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,680
Marry me.

137
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,000
Or don't marry me.

138
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,400
I don't care.

139
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,680
What about David?

140
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,760
Oh, forget him.

141
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,000
I can give you
everything that you need.

142
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,800
Just let me be with you.

143
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,360
Please God, let me be with you.

144
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,200
Have you ever seen
marks or bruises on her?

145
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,480
Yes.

146
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,720
Were they bad bruises?

147
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,640
Yes.

148
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,440
I do not want to
press you for details,

149
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:00,240
but how often did you see
that sort of mark on her?

150
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,760
Must be on... half
a dozen occasions.

151
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,160
Thank you, my Lord.

152
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,160
Thank you, Mr. Cussen.

153
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,720
You may step down.

154
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,320
I heard two bangs... shots.

155
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,760
And then what did you see?

156
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,400
I saw David lying on the ground

157
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,760
and Mrs. Ellis pointing
a gun into his back.

158
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,680
Why did you have to kill him?

159
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,880
No questions.

160
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,600
Leslie Davies, Detective
Chief Inspector, my Lord.

161
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,440
You saw the accused
woman detained

162
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,800
at Hampstead Police Station?

163
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,440
I did, my Lord.

164
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,640
Did you form any impression
of her emotional condition

165
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,440
at the time of the arrest?

166
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,040
I did, my Lord.

167
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,320
I was most impressed by
the fact she seemed very...

168
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,560
...composed.

169
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,600
No questions.

170
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,600
Why aren't you
cross-examining them?

171
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,400
I didn't see there was
anything useful to be added.

172
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,240
He broke her down
piece by piece.

173
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,520
You must get Findlater to...
to... to reveal what he knows,

174
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,120
what he and his
wife saw her suffer.

175
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,840
Mr. Bickford, my
job is to show

176
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,000
what made the accused
so morbidly jealous

177
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,560
that she was provoked to kill.

178
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,200
Now, if Blakely was
merely a nasty thug,

179
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,920
she'd hardly mind if he went off
with another woman, would she?

180
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,120
It won't work.

181
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,160
As a defence, it's not enough.

182
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,760
I know who gave her the gun.

183
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,000
She didn't carry out
this crime alone.

184
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,520
She instructed me
not to mention it,

185
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,000
but we must overrule her,
in her own best interest.

186
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,000
Keep your voice down,
for Christ's sake.

187
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,000
Drag someone else into it now,

188
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,800
and it becomes premeditated
conspiracy to murder.

189
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,320
No hope of manslaughter.

190
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,600
What if she was
persuaded, coerced even?

191
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,240
We have a defence!

192
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,400
She was provoked by
uncontrollable sexual jealousy,

193
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,720
and you should never breach
your client's confidence again.

194
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,840
Is that understood?

195
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,440
Yes, Mr. Stevenson.

196
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,400
The defence calls
Anthony Findlater.

197
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,400
I swear by almighty God that
the evidence I shall give

198
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,160
shall be the truth,
the whole truth,

199
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,680
and nothing but the truth.

200
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,160
...David, darling.
Hello, you two.

201
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,680
Give it here! It's my turn!

202
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,360
- Perfect timing.
- Oh, no. Watch out.

203
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,800
...Anthony, darling.
...Carole, my love.

204
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,840
David, how are you?

205
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,200
I'm so sorry...
about last night.

206
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,560
I was humiliated, David,
in front of everyone,

207
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,040
by your friend, Carole.

208
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,240
Yes, well, I think
she was a bit upset.

209
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,560
Why?

210
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:49,600
I told her I was breaking
it off with Mary.

211
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,200
I'm not marrying someone just
because they approve of her.

212
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,000
I don't care what they think.

213
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:59,560
I don't care what
any of them think.

214
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,640
I want to be with you.

215
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,200
Well, poor Mary.

216
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,136
You might have chosen a
better day than your birthday,

217
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,360
you heartless bastard.

218
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,800
I wondered if I might get
an advance on my wages.

219
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,120
Been sponging again, has he?

220
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,600
Gonna have to start charging
you rent on the flat.

221
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,400
You can't do that.

222
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,320
That flat is a place of
business, not a love nest.

223
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,080
You think he'll make you happy?

224
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,680
I'm not asking him to leave.

225
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,680
Rent will be £12 a week then.

226
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,600
What's this?

227
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,440
The children are asleep,

228
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,880
and dinner will be
served in five minutes.

229
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,800
What are we having?

230
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,600
The only thing I
know how to cook...

231
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,080
egg and soldiers.

232
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,280
- Ah.
- Nanny taught me.

233
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,120
Course she did.

234
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:31,000
And I always serve
my boiled eggs...

235
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,680
with Pol Roger.

236
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,400
What will your mother think

237
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,640
about you breaking
it off with Mary?

238
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,960
Not very happy, I
shouldn't think.

239
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,280
Hm.

240
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,360
She likes to pretend
we're a model family,

241
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,560
which is...

242
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,800
frankly, delusional.

243
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,920
Your parents divorced?

244
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Mm.

245
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,440
I was 11.

246
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,080
What happened?

247
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,240
Er, my father had an affair...

248
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,920
...with a waitress half his age.

249
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,400
And she got pregnant,
had an abortion,

250
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,400
and... she died.

251
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,880
Christ.

252
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,400
They accused him of
procuring the drugs.

253
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,840
You know, he was a GP.

254
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,440
They tried him for murder.

255
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,200
He was acquitted.

256
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:44,280
The judge said there
was no case to answer.

257
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,480
Yeah, he went back to
his medical practise,

258
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,000
his... his golf,

259
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,520
but our family...

260
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,600
it was poisoned.

261
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,200
I'm so sorry.

262
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,800
Are these... love bites?

263
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,840
Who? Who is she?

264
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,096
Jealousy doesn't
suit you, darling.

265
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,640
For God's sake, Carole?

266
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,760
She's married to my best friend.

267
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,640
Which is exactly why
you'd both do it.

268
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,600
You've got it in for
her, haven't you?

269
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,080
Because you're an imitation,
and she's the real thing.

270
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,000
When you're cross the
accent slips, darling.

271
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,640
I used to think your
sort had manners!

272
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,440
What a fool I was!

273
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,280
There's nothing going
on with me and David,

274
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,880
hasn't been for years.

275
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,856
You expect me to believe that,
the way you are with him?

276
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,240
Both of you, actually.

277
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,696
- Now look here...
- Stay out of this, Ant.

278
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,880
Take her.

279
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,960
You're like leeches,
both of you,

280
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,400
the way you follow him
around, fawning over him.

281
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,960
It's em... embarrassing.

282
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,720
How dare you come to my
house with my child here?

283
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,440
Now you might have dragged David
into your seedy, little world,

284
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,120
but you will not drag me.

285
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,000
And to talk about leeches?

286
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,416
You have been a parasite on
David since the day you met him,

287
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,360
thinking you could drag
yourself up in the world,

288
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,720
drag your whole
squalid family up.

289
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,480
David is naive. I'm not.
His friends are not.

290
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,000
We know what you're up to.

291
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,720
It is not... It
is not like that.

292
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,840
And you know what he's
like. You know what he does.

293
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
He never did it to me.

294
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,520
This is of your own
making, Ruth... all of it.

295
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,760
And you will be stopped
before you destroy David, too.

296
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,400
Sooner or later, I
will make him see

297
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,800
who and what you are...

298
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,520
that you are...

299
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,080
well, a predator, and
this is all a trap.

300
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,360
Then you will have my
blood on your hands.

301
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,560
Don't come here again.

302
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,800
Mr. Anthony Findlater...

303
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,760
in the days before
Mr. Blakely's death,

304
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,280
while he was staying with you,

305
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,800
you received several telephone
calls from Mrs. Ellis.

306
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,520
Yes.

307
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,520
Was it quite plain to
you when you spoke to her

308
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,920
on the telephone that she was
in a desperate state of emotion?

309
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,600
Er, no.

310
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,840
Did you observe no
indication that she was

311
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,160
a very desperate
woman at the time?

312
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,680
David, I know you're in there!

313
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,760
David!

314
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,840
No.

315
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,560
Was it obvious to you
that she was in a state

316
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:16,000
of considerable
emotional disturbance?

317
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,000
I didn't get that impression.

318
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,600
She might've been.

319
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,400
On the Saturday night,
did you and Blakely

320
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,480
come out of the house
with a young woman?

321
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,560
I believe she was your nanny.

322
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:34,000
I do not remember.

323
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,600
You will appreciate what
is being suggested...

324
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:43,480
that there is some reason
for Ruth Ellis being jealous

325
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:47,000
of some new woman on the scene.

326
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,240
I did not even know that Mrs.
Ellis knew we had a nanny.

327
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,200
Mr. Stevenson?

328
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,920
No further questions.

329
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,680
So that's it?

330
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,760
That's all they're
going to ask him?

331
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,720
Put Carole up there.

332
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,120
It's... It's too late.

333
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,240
Put Carole in the witness box

334
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,440
and ask her about the weeks
leading up to David's death.

335
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,240
Ask her what she did to my baby.

336
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,320
What did she do?

337
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,080
We can't call Carole,
but you can tell them.

338
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,880
This jury... they...
they want your blood.

339
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,080
To them, you're...
you're not a-a person,

340
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,200
you're a character in a story,

341
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,080
a cold-blooded murderess

342
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,480
in a cheap thriller
they've read before.

343
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:59,000
And they know the
ending. Change the story.

344
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,520
Give them a different ending.

345
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,600
Make them want to
save your life.

346
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,240
David Blakely was living
with you in a flat

347
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,000
which you occupied
above the Little Club?

348
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,440
Yes.

349
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,440
Were you at that
time doing your best

350
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,680
to build up the, er,
business of the club?

351
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,600
My one concern was to
build up the business,

352
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,800
which had been a
failure beforehand.

353
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,160
And at that time, were you
very much in love with him?

354
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,920
Oh!

355
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,840
Did you tell him that you wanted

356
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,920
to break off the
relationship with him?

357
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,600
David!

358
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,800
Yes.

359
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,160
Stop. Stop.

360
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,040
I want you to go.

361
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,240
I want you to pack your
things and go tonight.

362
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,240
Stop! God, it's not even the
cheating and the violence.

363
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,600
That's nothing new.

364
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,760
It's that you let
those malicious snobs

365
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,880
think that I'm the one
taking advantage of you!

366
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,320
How did he treat you physically?

367
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:44,840
I want you to leave! I
want you to get out now!

368
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,960
He was violent on occasions.

369
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:52,040
I found this...

370
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,240
in your bedside table.

371
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,440
It's his.

372
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,520
Isn't it?

373
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:10,360
And how did that
violence manifest itself?

374
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,200
He only used to hit me
with his fists and hands.

375
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,640
But I bruise very easily.

376
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,560
What effect did all
this have on you?

377
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,640
I began to feel ill
about the whole thing.

378
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,400
While this was going
on, what was happening

379
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,960
to your own earnings
at the club?

380
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,120
David?

381
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,880
They were deteriorating,
and so was the business.

382
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,856
Don't you ever come down
here looking like that again.

383
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,840
No wonder this place
is bloody empty!

384
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,840
David! David!

385
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,600
David, step away from the road!

386
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,800
I'll do it, I swear!

387
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,360
If you leave me, I'll do it.

388
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,440
David, step away from
the road, please! Please!

389
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,920
Now, all this time you and
he were living at the club,

390
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,920
had he any money?

391
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,680
I had to give him
money all the time...

392
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,920
bought his clothes and things.

393
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,240
I paid his drinks
bills and things.

394
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,560
My stepfather's
threatening to cut me off!

395
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,600
It'll be over for me!

396
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,360
The racing.

397
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,960
There's nothing else I can do.
It's not like I haven't tried.

398
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,120
I'm just... I'm just useless!

399
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,360
Alright.

400
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,120
- My father's inheritance is gone!
- It's alright. It's alright.

401
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,456
-My... My family are gone! My mother hardly speaks to me!
-It's alright. It's alright.

402
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,800
How did David then
behave toward you?

403
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,240
He was possessive and jealous.

404
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:00,000
He seemed... I thought
he seemed devoted to me.

405
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,880
Please don't leave me.

406
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,120
Look at you.

407
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,840
What happened to your
feelings from then on?

408
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,720
He was a very likeable person,
and I got very attached to him.

409
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,160
Marry me.

410
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,680
I'm already married.

411
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,760
Then divorce him.

412
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,520
- What about your family?
- I don't care about them.

413
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:33,680
I will never have any
happiness unless you marry me.

414
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:41,160
This is a photograph
that Blakely gave you.

415
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,560
Yes?

416
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,880
Yes.

417
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,680
Did he write on it
in your presence?

418
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,160
Yes.

419
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,080
"To Ruth.

420
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,440
All my love.

421
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,520
David.'

422
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:21,320
My Lord, I wonder if
she might sit down?

423
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,800
Yes, certainly.

424
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,400
I'm quite alright.

425
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,560
Do, by all means.

426
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,640
I don't need to sit down.

427
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,040
And then, two weeks
before David's death,

428
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,760
did you find that
you were pregnant?

429
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,680
Yes.

430
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,680
What happened about it?

431
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:49,280
Well, we got into a fight
and David got very violent.

432
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,640
He thumped me in the tummy.

433
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,696
I do not know if that's
what caused the miscarriage

434
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,920
or not, though.

435
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,160
You, er...

436
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,240
had a...

437
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,560
a miscarriage?

438
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,640
Yes.

439
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:24,360
And we've heard the evidence
about you taking a revolver

440
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,320
and getting a cab to
Hampstead and shooting him.

441
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,960
Is that right?

442
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,080
Quite correct.

443
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,840
Why did you do it?

444
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,560
I don't really know,
quite seriously.

445
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,640
I was just very upset.

446
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:53,200
"I do not really
know why I shot him."

447
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,160
Is that right?

448
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,800
Yes.

449
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,720
Mrs. Ellis...

450
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:16,000
when you fired that
revolver at close range

451
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,760
into the body of David Blakely,

452
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,640
what did you intend to do?

453
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,840
It is quite obvious, when I shot
him, I intended to kill him.

454
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,760
I hope they
appreciated the suit.

455
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,600
It's real Astrakhan, you know.

456
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,240
What was that?

457
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,480
What was what?

458
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,800
In the witness box.

459
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,560
You looked embarrassed.
Y-You looked bored.

460
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,200
It became perfectly clear none
of this is going to do any good.

461
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:15,040
What were you going to tell them
about what the Findlaters did,

462
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,120
about the miscarriage?

463
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,160
Thank you for securing
my hair appointment.

464
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,480
I know the prison were
rather difficult about it.

465
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,960
I think they thought I was
going to drink the bleach.

466
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,856
No chance, not at least
before I got my roots done.

467
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,080
Oh, for God's sake, Ruth!

468
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:35,400
Make these people understand
what you've been through!

469
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,560
Tell them about whatever
it was the Findlaters did,

470
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,440
or... or tell me, at least.

471
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,560
No one wants to hear
about my insides.

472
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,760
The jury don't, Stevenson
certainly doesn't,

473
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,560
and you... I know you think
you do, but you don't.

474
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,600
No one wants to hear
about women bleeding

475
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,040
and what men do to
make them bleed.

476
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:55,400
It's all a little bit
embarrassing for everyone.

477
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,840
It's certainly not going to
get me off a murder charge.

478
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,640
They believed Ant, you see...

479
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,720
and his lies.

480
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,520
We should have told the police
about Cussen's involvement.

481
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:18,440
You've perjured yourself
in the witness box,

482
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,600
and I allowed it.

483
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:29,160
You've condemned yourself.

484
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,040
So, what follows,
Dr. Whittaker,

485
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,400
as to the effect of infidelity

486
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,400
by the male partner
on the female mind?

487
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,520
Well, women are more prone to
hysterical reactions than men.

488
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:59,160
They are inclined to lose some
of their inhibitory capacity

489
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:02,040
and solve their
problems on a more...

490
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,040
primitive level.

491
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,600
George Ellis, please.

492
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,800
In your view, had the accused

493
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:25,400
considered the consequences
of what she was doing?

494
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,960
Well, I asked her if she
thought about her children,

495
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,600
and she said she did not
think of them at all.

496
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,360
Alright. Now, you be
good for Daddy, okay?

497
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,240
I'll call tonight to see
how she's settling in.

498
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,960
Give it a few days, eh? My
solicitor will be in touch.

499
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,240
About the divorce proceedings.

500
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,040
Thank you, Dr. Whittaker.

501
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,120
You may step down.

502
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,880
That is my case, my Lord.

503
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:21,520
Before you address the
jury, it would be as well

504
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,000
if we had a short
discussion as to the law.

505
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,400
You may release the jury
until tomorrow morning.

506
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,720
I gather you wish
to address the jury

507
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,880
as to the question
of provocation.

508
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,600
I do, my Lord.

509
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,040
There has to be some
conduct, has there not,

510
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,520
on the part of the deceased man

511
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,880
which caused this
unfortunate result?

512
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,800
What is the evidence of
conduct on Blakely's part

513
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,040
which is considered to
amount to provocation?

514
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,720
May I be absolutely frank
about that, my Lord?

515
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:06,080
The answer is that
there is no authority...

516
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,680
no authority that
has ever considered

517
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,240
the effects on the female
mind of infidelity.

518
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,080
Does your proposition
come to this...

519
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,600
if a man associates with a woman

520
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,720
and then leaves her suddenly

521
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,600
and she is a jealous woman,
emotionally disturbed,

522
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:27,040
and goes out and shoots him,
that is sufficient grounds

523
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:31,960
for the jury to reduce the
crime of murder to manslaughter?

524
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,640
Mr. Bickford?

525
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:50,120
A single day to hear all the
evidence in a murder trial?

526
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,240
Why did nobody
ask about the gun?

527
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,800
I'm sorry?

528
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,760
Well, I know she lied
about how she got it.

529
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,560
There was never any gun left
at the club as security.

530
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,280
I told the police, but
nobody seemed to care.

531
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:06,440
And what about that black
cab that was never found?

532
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:10,440
You know Desmond Cussen used
to drive a black cab for fun?

533
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,080
- Is it him?
- What?

534
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,640
- Did... Did he help her?
- I don't know.

535
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,800
It's not true, is it?

536
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,080
It's not too late.
You can get her back.

537
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,760
The... The three of
you... you can all...

538
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,320
live with me.

539
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,360
I know you think
you can save me.

540
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,000
But it's just a sweet fantasy

541
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,880
to distract from
the sordid truth,

542
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,160
which is that you
are a lonely drunk,

543
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,840
and I'm a hostess whose
company you pay for.

544
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,600
Why are you doing this, Ruth?

545
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,720
Because I love him.

546
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,680
I will save you.

547
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,280
Whether you want me to or not.

548
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:49,720
It is my duty as a Judge,
as a matter of law,

549
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,120
to direct the jury that
the evidence in this case

550
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,800
does not support a
verdict of manslaughter

551
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,400
on the grounds of provocation.

552
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,160
My Lord, in view of that ruling,

553
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,760
it does not seem that
it would be proper

554
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,000
for me to address
the jury at all.

555
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,960
It does not seem to me that
there is any issue left

556
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,600
on which you could
address the jury.

557
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,960
No, my Lord.

558
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,040
I am obliged.

559
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:22,200
In the circumstances, my Lord,
I have nothing more to say.

560
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,240
Members of the jury...

561
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:37,240
according to our law, it
is no defence for a woman

562
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,000
who is charged with the
murder of her lover,

563
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,720
to prove she was a jealous woman

564
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,760
and had been badly
treated by her lover,

565
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,400
and after he left
her without warning,

566
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:53,920
she became furious with him and
formed an intention to kill him.

567
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,960
None of these facts,
individually or collectively,

568
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:01,800
afford any defence.

569
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,400
Shame on you!

570
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,080
All of you!

571
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,680
Get off me!

572
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,640
Hampstead Police Station.

573
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,360
I need to talk to you about
Ruth Ellis and Desmond Cussen.

574
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,520
Jury's back.

575
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,640
14 minutes.

576
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:03,000
Members of the jury, are you
agreed upon your verdict?

577
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,920
We are.

578
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,080
Do you find Ruth Ellis guilty
or not guilty of murder?

579
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,520
Guilty.

580
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,800
Prisoner at the bar, you
stand convicted of murder.

581
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,680
Have you anything to say

582
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,560
before judgement of death
is passed according to law?

583
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,640
Ruth Ellis...

584
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,800
the jury has convicted
you of murder.

585
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:04,440
In my view, it was the
only verdict possible.

586
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:07,120
You will be taken
hence to the prison

587
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,600
in which you were last confined

588
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:15,760
and from there to a
place of execution,

589
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:19,440
where you will suffer
death by hanging

590
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,320
and thereafter your body buried

591
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,120
within the precincts
of the prison,

592
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,040
and may the Lord have
mercy on your soul.

593
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:30,400
Amen.

594
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,920
Thanks.

595
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,480
Ah, that went very well.

596
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,960
Thank you, Edward. It
went better than expected.

597
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,800
- See you outside.
- Thank you.

598
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:07,200
Is that man your Junior
Treasury Counsel?

599
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,040
That's correct.

600
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:12,400
Edward Cussen?

601
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,680
Is he related to Desmond Cussen?

602
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,240
Mm.

603
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,160
They are cousins.

604
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:25,720
That's why you called Desmond
as a witness, isn't it?

605
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,080
To protect him from
other accusations,

606
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,840
such as conspiracy to murder.

607
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,320
Do you know much about
Buddhism, Mr. Bickford?

608
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,360
I've practised it for 30 years,

609
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:42,040
and one of its teachings is
that we are all responsible

610
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:45,000
for our own liberation.

611
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:48,400
Ruth Ellis Knows this.

612
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,120
No one else... no judge
or jury, no friend...

613
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,040
has put her in her
present position.

614
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:58,920
It is her own actions
that have done so.

615
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,040
That is karma.

616
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:13,960
I shall be starting the
reprieve case immediately.

617
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:19,720
Well, we did the best
we could for her.

618
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,160
No. No, we did not.

619
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:27,360
This whole process has
been a disgrace, a sham.

620
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,200
I'm going to fight for
her to be reprieved...

621
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:34,640
do things differently, as
they should have been done.

622
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:38,800
Desmond's cousin is in the same
chambers as Christmas Humphreys.

623
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,880
He's a bloody silk.

624
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:48,680
You knew... about Desmond.

625
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:54,600
Edward Cussen and I worked
together during the war.

626
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:57,320
Jesus Christ.

627
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:01,040
You were all in it together.

628
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,200
Of course.

629
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,480
That's why you
didn't cross-examine.

630
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,120
They asked you to protect him.

631
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,320
No.

632
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,560
No, they didn't.

633
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:16,440
Look, dragging somebody else
into it wouldn't have helped...

634
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,480
wouldn't have helped at all.

635
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,400
A woman like her...

636
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,920
they were never
gonna let her off.

637
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,360
She deserves clemency
for what she's suffered,

638
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,080
and I will fight for that.

639
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,920
You're to be moved.
