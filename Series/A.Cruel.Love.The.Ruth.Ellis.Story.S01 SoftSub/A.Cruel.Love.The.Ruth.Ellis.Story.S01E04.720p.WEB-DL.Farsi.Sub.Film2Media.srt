1
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,279
You are due to hang at
9:00 tomorrow morning...

2
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,360
...22 hours from now.

3
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,479
Do you wish to make
a new statement

4
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,319
about the murder
of David Blakely,

5
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,279
one that may materially
affect your legal situation?

6
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,360
Yes.

7
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,639
I had been ill for two weeks.

8
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,720
The miscarriage?

9
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,040
David had been so sorry.

10
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,799
Are you watching me sleep?

11
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,880
Listening to you snore.

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,359
I don't snore.

13
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,600
I want to be woken up by your
snoring the rest of my life.

14
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,639
Soppy little fool.

15
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,680
Is your stomach still painful?

16
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,239
It's fine. Doctor says
it's healing well.

17
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,320
Good.

18
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,639
'Cause I'm taking
you out tonight.

19
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,759
- Mm.
- Clean slate.

20
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,479
No more fighting. No more...

21
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,239
Cinema cleaning girls?

22
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,679
She was an usherette.

23
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,880
I do have some self-respect.

24
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,759
Neither one of us
has been perfect.

25
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,359
But from now on,

26
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,279
we're going to be a
boring old married couple,

27
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,199
you in a housecoat,
me in slippers.

28
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,879
And occasionally we'll
talk of how young,

29
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,080
foolish we used to be.

30
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,040
Promise?

31
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,240
Yes.

32
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,040
See you tonight.

33
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,639
Be ready at 8:00.

34
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,319
Findlaters' residence.

35
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,279
Is David there?

36
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,359
No.

37
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,079
Hello?

38
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,199
And who was that girl?

39
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,039
Look. David isn't
here, all right?

40
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,399
I got Desmond to drive
me to the Findlaters'.

41
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,880
Wait here.

42
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,519
- I want to speak to David.
- He's not here.

43
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,919
His car's outside.

44
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,999
I know he's in there
with some girl.

45
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,839
- That's our nanny.
- You did this, didn't you?

46
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,439
You threw her at him.

47
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,839
- David! David!
- He's left you, Ruth.

48
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,999
- You won't see him ever again.
- You're lying.

49
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,519
I have only ever
told you the truth.

50
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,239
You've never wanted to hear it.

51
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:23,199
He can't just walk away...
with everything in ruins.

52
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,119
I know you need someone to blame

53
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,959
for the way your
life has turned out.

54
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,359
You know, I had you down as
a dangerous sort of woman,

55
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,039
a predator who set a
trap for a naive boy.

56
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,159
But I was wrong.

57
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,160
You're just... a mess.

58
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,759
A wretched, ungovernable,
emotionally incontinent mess.

59
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,519
A whirlwind of
shabby destruction

60
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,559
bringing everyone
else down with you.

61
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,319
My job.

62
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,079
My savings.

63
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,999
My daughter.

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,599
My unborn child.

65
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,959
All gone because of him.

66
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,439
He does not get to walk
away without saying a word.

67
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,479
He doesn't! I have
to speak to him!

68
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,079
- David!
- There's nothing to say.

69
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,359
Then I want my key back
for Egerton Gardens.

70
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,879
- I want my key back.
- I'll have it sent to you.

71
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,239
You cannot do this!
You can't do this!

72
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,759
David!

73
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,720
David, I know
you're in... David!

74
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,640
I felt I had to do something...

75
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,519
...anything... to
make him listen.

76
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,519
Ruth? Ruth!

77
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,799
- David!
- That's enough.

78
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,279
- David!
- That's enough!

79
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,799
- That's enough.
- He's in there with a girl.

80
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,439
He's laughing at me!

81
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,759
Does he have a key
to Egerton Gardens,

82
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,199
the place I rented for
you, your new start?!

83
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,039
Has he been there all along?

84
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,999
What are you looking at?

85
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,679
- David! David!
- Get in the car, Ruth!

86
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,799
In the car, Ruth!

87
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,999
I had to go back the next day.

88
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,959
I was determined to
make David speak to me.

89
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,839
Their plan, what they
had wanted all along...

90
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,319
to get David away from
me, without looking back,

91
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,799
without acknowledging what he
had done to me... it'd worked.

92
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,079
Are you all in? Are you all in?

93
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,279
All night I sat there

94
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,399
and thought about
the last two years.

95
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,279
When I had first met David, I
was managing a successful club.

96
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,960
I had two beautiful children.

97
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,280
I had money in the
bank, admirers...

98
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,639
...a lovely flat.

99
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,839
And now all I had was
a bedsitting room.

100
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,200
No money. No job.

101
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,639
And a man who swore
he loved me one day

102
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,039
and then beat and
abused me the next.

103
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:38,240
A man who was relieved when
I lost the child he fathered.

104
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,239
I thought, and I thought.

105
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,879
All the things he
had said to me,

106
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,479
all the things he
had done to me.

107
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,959
And I just felt pure rage.

108
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,240
I don't know what to do.

109
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,279
- I'll make you some coffee.
- I don't want any coffee.

110
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,799
Well, tea, then!

111
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,400
I don't want any fucking tea!

112
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,799
I just... wish he was dead.

113
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,239
I wish he was dead.

114
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,079
I wish he would jump
in the lake and drown

115
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,719
and I could just be free.

116
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,599
We could be free.

117
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,359
I just want to be
done with all of it.

118
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,680
Do you?

119
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,640
Whose idea was it
to get the gun?

120
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,200
I wouldn't know how to use it.

121
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,679
I wouldn't know how to aim it.

122
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,760
I'll show you.

123
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,319
I need the permanent
undersecretary of state.

124
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,759
He's at Ascot.

125
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,359
Well, get him bloody
back from Ascot.

126
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,039
What message should I give?

127
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,359
Tell him Ruth Ellis isn't
going to hang tomorrow.

128
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,479
Mrs Ellis is accusing
Desmond Cussen

129
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,079
of conspiracy to murder?

130
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,559
Yes.

131
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,079
The execution will
have to be postponed

132
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,439
while he's interviewed.

133
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,239
If charges are
brought against him,

134
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,399
Ruth Ellis will be
the principal witness.

135
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,119
She will be needed
to give evidence.

136
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,119
And that's to say nothing
of her own conviction,

137
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,639
which can now be
regarded as unsafe.

138
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,479
She was drunk. She was
influenced by this man.

139
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,119
I anticipate a retrial
at the very least.

140
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,879
You are not in fact a...
criminal lawyer, Mr Mishcon.

141
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,440
You are a divorce solicitor?

142
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,959
Yes.

143
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,119
Well, the undersecretary is
on his way back from Ascot.

144
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,879
I will brief him,

145
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,679
and doubtless he will wish to
speak to the home secretary.

146
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,879
But the execution
will be postponed

147
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,599
while all this is investigated?

148
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,679
I can give no such assurance.

149
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,479
Not on the strength
of this alone.

150
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,079
Then what would you need?

151
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,599
We can do nothing until
Cussen is interviewed

152
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,079
at the very least.

153
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,279
We must have some
corroborating evidence.

154
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:32,039
Until then, I'm afraid...
these are just words.

155
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,959
Then call Scotland Yard and
instruct them to find him now.

156
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,239
As I say, I will
inform my superiors.

157
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,199
We have 16 hours until
she is due to die.

158
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,719
You're right. I know
little of criminal law.

159
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,919
But I know how long it
takes to divorce someone.

160
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,919
Six months minimum

161
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,119
between the decrees
nisi and absolute

162
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,679
to ensure the
grounds are correct,

163
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,079
that the marriage is
truly unsalvageable.

164
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,999
Because a divorce is an
absolute that cannot be undone.

165
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,079
Your government passed that law.

166
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,079
And you give this woman, between
conviction and killing her,

167
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,160
22 days.

168
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,680
Call the bloody police.

169
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,799
Cussen left his
office 20 minutes ago.

170
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,880
He's on his way home.

171
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,039
You said it yourself, sir.
She pulled the trigger.

172
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,999
Doesn't matter where
she got the gun.

173
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,840
You did everything right.

174
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,080
Let's go.

175
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,239
Thank you for coming back.

176
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,119
I know I wasn't the most
gracious hostess last time.

177
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,639
I deserved it.

178
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:56,279
You're many things...
but you are no coward.

179
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,920
I wasn't when there was no hope.

180
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,320
Now I'm bloody petrified.

181
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,839
Do you remember

182
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,199
when you and Vicki came
to visit me in hospital

183
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,680
and you brought gin
and a gramophone?

184
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,719
Matron told us not to turn
the place into a bordello,

185
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,599
but by midnight, she
was absolutely smashed

186
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,199
and dancing with us.

187
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,919
I remember Vicki flashing
the geriatric ward.

188
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,040
And three of them
proposing to her.

189
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,520
We sat up on the roof and
watched the sun come up.

190
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,599
I wish we could do
that tomorrow morning.

191
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,760
Before Mr Pierrepoint.

192
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,240
Well, the hangman can
sod off back to his pub.

193
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,400
Your statement
changed everything.

194
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,679
You do know what
his pub is called?

195
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,119
- Mm?
- Help the Poor Struggler.

196
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,519
No!

197
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,760
Joy told me.

198
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,839
Listen.

199
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,599
I can try to find Desmond...

200
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,679
get a confession and
take it to the police.

201
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,239
We don't have to.

202
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,199
DCI Davies has been
at the Home Office

203
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,280
getting a rocket up his arse.

204
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,959
They're going to
find Desmond, Jackie.

205
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,760
He's going to be arrested
and charged... tonight.

206
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,399
So, you want to know

207
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,599
if I have anything else
that might help you.

208
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,039
As you can see, I am in no
fit state to help anyone.

209
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,280
But you knew.

210
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,799
You clearly knew about the gun.

211
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,279
I made certain suppositions
which have proved to be true.

212
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,039
And you told her to stay quiet?

213
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,919
You advised her to lie, to
perjure herself in Crown Court?

214
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,679
I was bound by client
confidentiality,

215
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,999
as I still am.

216
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,360
Mrs Ellis made me swear
not to say anything.

217
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,999
You may say I made the wrong
decision, and perhaps I did.

218
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,319
My aim was to show
that she was provoked,

219
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,479
not that she'd
conspired with anyone,

220
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,359
premeditated the whole thing.

221
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,399
Well, that was very
convenient for Desmond Cussen

222
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,480
that you took that route.

223
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,719
Did you make a deal with him?

224
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,960
Certainly not, my friend.

225
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,799
I suppose my problem is
that I'm not brave enough

226
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,720
to stand up to all of them
all, to s... to stand up to it.

227
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,959
- It?
- The English machine.

228
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:52,159
The whole... thundering
weight of it.

229
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,759
Are you talking
about a conspiracy?

230
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,119
Nothing so vulgar.

231
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,639
The machine is bigger
than any one man.

232
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,919
It's bigger than any...

233
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:07,480
gentlemen's club or
courtroom or police station.

234
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,279
It is concerned with
self-preservation above all.

235
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,839
And it is ruthless, you may
say, to the point of savagery,

236
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,519
to anyone who threatens it.

237
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,399
And Ruth threatens it
in every possible way.

238
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,279
And that is why the machine
is determined to get her.

239
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,639
It has been from the start.

240
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,039
Oh, you're drunk, man.

241
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,599
And this is dangerous nonsense.

242
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,559
This is the law,
the justice system,

243
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,639
the finest in the world.

244
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,760
And you say I'm
talking nonsense?

245
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,319
I was like you, you know.

246
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,999
I thought I was one
of the good ones,

247
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,520
fighting the machine.

248
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,079
Until I realised I'm just
a cog being ground in it.

249
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,799
If you know something
that could help her,

250
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,399
we have hours to save her life.

251
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,600
It's too late.

252
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,679
- That's Pierrepoint!
- That's the hangman!

253
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,199
- Murderer!
- How do you sleep at night?

254
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,319
Where's all your shame at?

255
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,719
Pierrepoint! Come back!

256
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,800
You bastard!

257
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,519
Why didn't you say anything

258
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,959
about Desmond Cussen before?

259
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,040
It seemed traitorous.

260
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,239
Until I realised he'd
betrayed me worse.

261
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,440
He promised to look after Andre?

262
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,519
Nothing. Not a visit.

263
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,959
Not a single penny.

264
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,759
What does Andre know?

265
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,319
He's been told you're in
Italy modelling swimsuits.

266
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:54,879
The MP, Mr Rogers, and his
wife, they've been very kind.

267
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,719
Offered to take him to the
country for a few days.

268
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,439
Get him away from all this.

269
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,359
But now we might not need to.

270
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,519
They tannoyed the undersecretary
of state at Ascot.

271
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,919
The press heard it.

272
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,919
Reporters camped
out at the house...

273
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,159
one from bloody New Zealand.

274
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,719
Evening papers all
saying the same thing...

275
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,479
a last-minute reprieve.

276
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,599
And there's been money
sent in by well-wishers.

277
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,319
Enough for you and Andre
to get away somewhere.

278
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,919
A new life!

279
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,799
Well, you'll never
need to work again.

280
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,879
Talk shows,
after-dinner speeches.

281
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,079
You're a flaming celebrity.

282
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,399
Evans! Bentley! Ellis!

283
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:44,400
Evans! Bentley! Ellis!

284
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,799
There's hundreds of them!

285
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:05,160
Evans! Bentley! Ellis!
Evans! Bentley! Ellis!

286
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,479
Hundreds of people have
gathered this evening

287
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,559
outside Holloway Prison in
support of Mrs Ruth Ellis,

288
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,399
who is due to hang
tomorrow morning

289
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,719
for the murder of her
lover, David Blakely.

290
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,879
A nightclub hostess, Mrs
Ellis was sentenced to death

291
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,399
at the Old Bailey on the
21st of June this year

292
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,479
for killing Mr Blakely.

293
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,159
Lawyers for Mrs Ellis claim
that new evidence has surfaced

294
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,319
Implicating an unnamed person

295
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,519
and placing them at
the scene of the crime.

296
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,399
Her newly appointed
solicitor, Mr Victor Mishcon,

297
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,280
has submitted new evidence
to the Home Off...

298
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,600
This heat, it's hellish.

299
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,400
Let's get out of London.

300
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,679
Pack some things.

301
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,359
It's 9:00. Twelve
hours until she hangs.

302
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,839
Why aren't you out looking
for Desmond Cussen?

303
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,599
She shot him in the back, right?

304
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,119
Point-blank range.
An innocent bloke.

305
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,759
Could've been any one of us.

306
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,599
She deserves to
bloody swing for it.

307
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,199
Oh, shut up, Peter.

308
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,959
We looked for him, all right?

309
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,159
There's no answer
at Cussen's flat,

310
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,319
and we've driven round
the West End for hours.

311
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,279
I've been given two
men and half a day

312
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,039
to search the whole
of bloody London.

313
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,080
Does it really seem like
anyone wants him to be found?

314
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,719
Lucia, where is he?

315
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,839
Upstairs.

316
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,559
Thanks.

317
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:33,159
Desmond... Do you know
how I can find him?

318
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,239
You know me, Jackie.
I'm no grass.

319
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,959
No police. They've given up.

320
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,679
Please tell me, Morris.

321
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,080
Is he with one of your girls?

322
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,560
She should have asked me.

323
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,640
To take care of him... Blakely.

324
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,640
I'd have taken pleasure in it.

325
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,319
Ruth is in there,
waiting to die...

326
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:09,400
while you're here,
enjoying yourself.

327
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,399
Towel.

328
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,640
Hurry up!

329
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,240
Got reporters chasing
me night and day.

330
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,839
Customers deserting me.

331
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,199
And you want me to grass up one
of the only punters I got left?

332
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:36,039
Ruthie wanted
everything... the big job,

333
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:40,439
big, posh bloke, big
rock on her finger.

334
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,480
She went too far.
Took too much.

335
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,560
She ruined all of us.

336
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,760
I know you're not a bad man.

337
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,639
But you've done
some bad things...

338
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,040
to Ruth...

339
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,760
...to me.

340
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,640
This is your chance
to fix it, all of it.

341
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:14,560
Help me find him. Please.

342
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,559
Open the door, Desmond.

343
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,640
There's no police here.

344
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,760
You've been here all along.

345
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,879
I've come here as a friend to
ask you to do the right thing.

346
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,919
The police know you
helped kill Blakely.

347
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,439
You may not have
pulled the trigger,

348
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,359
but he is dead because of you.

349
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,999
She's lying... to
save her own skin.

350
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,039
I don't blame her, but I...

351
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,359
had nothing to do
with any of it.

352
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:08,680
You have one chance to
save the woman you loved.

353
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,399
She never loved me.

354
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,079
Is that why you did it?

355
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,359
To punish Ruth and
David together?

356
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,920
You knew she would be arrested.

357
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,319
She came to you when
she was desperate.

358
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,239
You could have helped her.
You should have helped her!

359
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,839
But instead you gave a
broken woman a loaded gun.

360
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,879
You know they haven't
even told Andre yet

361
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,359
about what is happening
to his mother?

362
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,879
But soon they will have to.

363
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:39,359
They will have to tell him
that she isn't in Italy,

364
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,520
modelling swimsuits...

365
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,760
...but that she's dead.

366
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,519
Hanged.

367
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:52,439
And he won't even be
able to visit her grave

368
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,839
because she will be buried with
murderers in the prison pit.

369
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,839
What you have done to that
child is unforgivable.

370
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,999
I told Ruth he should have
been at her mother's that day.

371
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,080
Was Andre there?

372
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,399
Did... Did he see something?

373
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,440
Make sure he gets this.

374
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,080
We're leaving.

375
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,519
Wait.

376
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,959
Hey! W...

377
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,840
Don't.

378
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,479
He's gone.

379
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,680
Of course he has.

380
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,880
I told the police, but he
could be anywhere by now.

381
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,040
He talked about Andre.

382
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,240
Was Andre there when
Desmond gave you the gun?

383
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,679
Did he see Desmond
give it to you?

384
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:54,839
Right hand on first,
left hand supporting.

385
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,560
Legs shoulder-width apart.

386
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,199
Elbows straight, not locked.

387
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,319
Now, this little
blade is the sight.

388
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,799
Get that on your target,
then squeeze the trigger.

389
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,919
Most importantly,
don't hold your breath

390
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,479
or you'll tense up... and
you won't hit the target.

391
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,760
Breathe.

392
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,280
In and out.

393
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,199
Nice and calm.

394
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,720
I can't do it.

395
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,679
Yes, you can.

396
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,959
You see?

397
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,720
I told you to wait in
the car. Go back! Now!

398
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,519
How much does he know?

399
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,159
He knows enough.

400
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,919
He's a witness.

401
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,399
The police need evidence
to support your statement.

402
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,599
We thought only Desmond
could give that.

403
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,799
- But Andre could.
- No. I won't.

404
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,079
I will not use him like that.
I will not ask that of him.

405
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,439
I think he knows you are here.

406
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,080
Of course he does.

407
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,959
He's a smart boy.

408
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,959
He doesn't believe that nonsense
about swimsuits in Italy.

409
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,160
Then let him talk to the police.

410
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:42,360
If he gives a statement to
the police and it fails...

411
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,439
...he will blame himself.

412
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:51,839
But you still have a chance...
if you ask him to do this.

413
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,240
He needs to tell them and the
police what he knows tonight.

414
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,720
I won't be long.

415
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,919
You will look after
him? You promise?

416
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,439
Whatever happens?

417
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,520
I swear it.

418
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,959
Are you quite well there, dear?

419
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,760
Yes, she's quite all
right, thank you.

420
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,200
Are you all right?

421
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,960
I don't know.

422
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,239
I'm here. I'm with you.

423
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,039
I love you.

424
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,960
I know.

425
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,319
I don't think I can.

426
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,520
Of course you can.

427
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,479
Four bottles of
light ale, please.

428
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,199
Oh, and two packets
of cigarettes.

429
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,479
- Come on.
- Because we're having a party

430
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,559
- round the corner.
- Leave the poor girl alone

431
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,839
It would've been rude
not to invite her.

432
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,199
Leave the poor girl alone.

433
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,679
David.

434
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,760
David!

435
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,999
Jesus C... Ruth, what are y...

436
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,199
No.

437
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,599
Christ. She's got a fucking...

438
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,400
Go and get help!
Go and get help!

439
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,119
She killed him!

440
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,239
I won't be long.

441
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,720
Why did you have to kill him?!

442
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,400
Yes?

443
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,359
I took down your
statement this morning.

444
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,679
It appears that another
version was recorded, too,

445
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,479
by the, er, the... the prison
officer who sat with us.

446
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,559
In his version, you
ask Cussen for the gun.

447
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,919
I didn't say that.

448
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:50,879
I'm asking myself... w-why
they're focused on this version,

449
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,559
why they might be favouring it.

450
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,479
'Cause they want it
all to be over...

451
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,839
the protests, the
noise, the fuss,

452
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,479
the newspapers, the petitions,

453
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,319
all these people talking
about what a mess it is.

454
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,199
It's an embarrassment, and they
want it over and done with.

455
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,679
They were looking for a reason
to ignore what I told them,

456
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,159
to say that Desmond's
part doesn't matter.

457
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,839
And they found it.

458
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,279
They can't ignore it.
There are legal procedures.

459
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,119
Mr Bickford was right all along.

460
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,600
He said they wouldn't let me get
away with it, and they won't.

461
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,959
Right.

462
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,599
No matter what anyone
says or does now...

463
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,399
it won't do anything.

464
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,279
They are determined to put an
end to this, and they will,

465
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,440
tomorrow at 9:00 a.m.

466
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,959
I want you to call my parents
and say that Andre is to go away

467
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,719
with the MP, Mr Rogers,
and his wife, as planned.

468
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,759
You don't want him to make
a statement to police?

469
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,999
No. I want him out of London
and away from here immediately!

470
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,239
Please do it now.

471
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,559
Pray with us!

472
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,519
Our Father, Who art in heaven...

473
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,759
...hallowed be Thy
name, Thy kingdom come,

474
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:02,319
Thy will be done on
earth as it is in heaven.

475
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,559
Give us today our daily bread...

476
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,119
...as we forgive those...

477
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,679
Mrs. Ellis?

478
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,879
Make them stop. Quiet.

479
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,759
I just... want it to be over.

480
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,359
- Ruth, come with me.
- For thine is the kingdom...

481
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,439
Up we get. Up we get.

482
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,159
- Up we get.
- ...forever and ever.

483
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,320
Amen.

484
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,239
I thought you might like

485
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,039
to finally take your
beer privileges.

486
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,719
Is this allowed out here?

487
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,760
No. But what can
they do to you?

488
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,719
Thanks.

489
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,519
Not done much.

490
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,039
You might not believe this,

491
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:36,719
but the last few weeks have been
some of the best of my life.

492
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,400
You've all been so kind to me.

493
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:44,480
Calling me Mrs Ellis,
three square meals a day.

494
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,400
All those jam puddings.

495
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,919
No screaming, no fighting,

496
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:58,079
no men knocking on my door
in the middle of the night.

497
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,680
I've really rather
liked it here.

498
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:36,039
Can you put me through to the
governor of Holloway Prison?

499
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,319
Mrs Ellis.

500
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,760
You've come to tell me there's
not going to be a reprieve.

501
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,200
It's quite all right.

502
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,520
It's quite all right. Promise.

503
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,240
What time is it?

504
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,040
2 a.m.

505
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,560
Seven hours, then.

506
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,959
Would you like to
sit up together?

507
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,120
I have some brandy in my office.

508
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,359
Actually, I'd quite
like to get some sleep,

509
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,639
if you don't mind.

510
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,720
Thank you.

511
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,319
Philip Allen.

512
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,959
I want to speak to
the home secretary.

513
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,159
I insist on speaking
to him personally.

514
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,239
The home secretary has made
his position very clear.

515
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,039
And what is that position?

516
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,800
He says if she isn't hanged
tomorrow, she never will be.

517
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,919
I have practised
law for 20 years.

518
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,879
And until today, I would
not have thought it possible

519
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,719
that it should be used by
Englishmen in this way.

520
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:37,560
As a fig leaf for an
act of pure savagery!

521
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,439
No more prison smocks, then.

522
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,720
Can't say I'm sorry.

523
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,519
Hardy Amies.

524
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,959
Spent my entire first
wage from Carroll's on it.

525
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,399
It's lovely.

526
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,799
My mother was horrified.

527
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,199
Said I should've made do with
rayon like everybody else.

528
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,239
Probably should've made
do with a lot of things.

529
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:27,799
Little house in Basingstoke,
job in a typing pool,

530
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,479
week in Bognor with a
fat husband once a year.

531
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,319
I couldn't.

532
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:36,559
I wanted everything I could get
out of this life, every drop.

533
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,080
And I don't regret it.

534
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,559
Not a single moment.

535
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,080
Jacqueline?

536
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,039
I'm sorry. I tried.

537
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,719
They won't let me run the
story in the newspaper.

538
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,879
You need evidence
of what Cussen did?

539
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,960
I need something.

540
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,400
When all this is over, you
talk to Andre, her son.

541
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,719
How lovely.

542
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,679
Thank you, Joy.

543
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,479
Sorry.

544
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,359
It will calm you.

545
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,440
No, thank you.

546
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,519
Charity Taylor.

547
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,399
I'm so sorry, Mrs Ellis.

548
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,800
I just need a moment
with the undersheriff.

549
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,119
There's been a call
from a Miss Holmes,

550
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,199
claiming to be the home
secretary's office.

551
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,399
A reprieve. I've
tried to verify it.

552
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,999
No one there knows
anything about it.

553
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,400
A hoax?

554
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:04,280
It must be. Mustn't it?

555
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:09,359
This Miss Holmes...

556
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,519
I've tried two
private secretaries.

557
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,600
No one's heard of her.

558
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,240
Thank you.

559
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,360
I won't be needing
these any more.

560
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,559
One minute to, ma'am.

561
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:43,760
We can't make her
wait. It's torture.

562
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,639
I mean, it... it's
got to be a hoax.

563
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,200
Proceed.

564
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,439
It's all right, lass.

565
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,440
It's all right.

566
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,799
Follow me.

567
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:32,439
Don't worry, lass.
I won't hurt you.
