1
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,880
How lovely. Thank you, Joy.

2
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,720
Sorry.

3
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,880
It will... calm you.

4
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,600
No, thank you.

5
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,960
David?

6
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,640
Why did you do it?!

7
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,400
Why did you have to kill him?!

8
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,080
Nail file. Scent bottle.

9
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,320
Lip brush. Sixpence in copper.

10
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,520
Powder compact.

11
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,840
One .38 revolver and six empty
cases, already in custody.

12
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,080
We've just seen the
body of David Blakely

13
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,840
at Hampstead Mortuary.

14
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,920
I understand you know
something about it.

15
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,840
Tell us about how
Blakely ended up dead.

16
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,200
I am guilty.

17
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,400
I'm rather confused.

18
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,960
Hold still!

19
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,560
I've got lippy on, Vicki.

20
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,120
Well, not enough for Morrie.

21
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,600
Perfect. Drinks
on you tonight?

22
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,400
If I get the job.

23
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,560
Knock him dead.

24
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,640
You're a good hostess, Ruthie,

25
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,800
but it's a big step from
hostessing to management.

26
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,200
Not many girls of your...

27
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,560
background make it.

28
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,920
I know, sir, but I will.

29
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,000
A peer of the realm, an actor,

30
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,480
and a travelling salesman
all want a table.

31
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,520
You've got one
left. Who gets it?

32
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,080
Well...

33
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,680
the poshos get a kick out
of being treated like scum.

34
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,400
So you send Lord
Snootybollocks packing.

35
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,680
He'll tell all his mates
and come back for more.

36
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,520
The actor just wants free booze.

37
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,720
So you set him up at the bar,
let everyone get an eyeful,

38
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,720
got yourself a gossip piece
in "The Mirror" the next day.

39
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,040
Now the salesman...
he may look shabby,

40
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,800
but he's got pockets
full of cash.

41
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,720
A few years ago he was
a hero, fighting Nazis.

42
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,560
Now he's flogging
dusters door to door.

43
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,000
You make him feel
like somebody again,

44
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,040
he'll spend everything he's got.

45
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,520
He gets the table.

46
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,080
How's it going
with the new bloke?

47
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,400
He sent me every bouquet from
The Dorchester's florist.

48
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,720
- How'd you meet him, anyway?
- Stephen, obviously.

49
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,200
Of course, that
bone-crunching perv.

50
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,640
He's been good to me.

51
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,200
Could introduce
you to Lord Astor.

52
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,520
He's just got divorced.
- No, thanks.

53
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,640
What you need is a nice, rich
husband, big, posh house.

54
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,960
All you'd have to do is
spank him once a week.

55
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,160
Thank you.

56
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,200
Do you mind?

57
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,880
This is a private conversation.

58
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,920
Shush, I know him
from Carroll's.

59
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,520
Oh.

60
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,640
Erm, er, sorry. I wasn't,
erm, eavesdropping.

61
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,440
It's Miss Ellis?

62
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,520
Yes. Hello.

63
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,880
Er, Desmond Cussen.

64
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,200
This is Vicki Martin. My
children, Andre and Georgina.

65
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,240
Hm.

66
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,520
"The Beano."

67
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,120
I'm more of a
"Magnet" man myself.

68
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,320
Well, I was thinking
that I might

69
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,720
go to Carroll's Club tonight.

70
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,256
Actually, I'm not
working there any more.

71
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,840
Got a new job.

72
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,840
...Er, congratulations.
...Thank you.

73
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,800
It's at the Little Club.

74
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,920
Er, good... Er, goodbye then.

75
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,480
Stephen Ward may be a perv,
but at least he's amusing.

76
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,200
It's, erm... very funny today.

77
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,960
Desmond?

78
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,240
Since I'm celebrating,

79
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,320
you can buy me a drink
later if you like.

80
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,440
That would be lovely.

81
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,800
Shall we?

82
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,880
- Evening, Reggie.
- Evening.

83
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,920
Evening.

84
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,360
The club's reopening
next week, redecorated.

85
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,720
I'll be London's
youngest club manager.

86
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,680
Quite an achievement.

87
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,680
I've been working
since I was 14...

88
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,880
Cinema Cafe, Lyon's
Corner House.

89
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,600
Most of the money went
to my mother. Still does.

90
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,120
It's all I've ever wanted
to do, really... work.

91
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,920
I-I thought, erm, girls
mostly wanted to get married.

92
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,200
Tried that. No, thank you.

93
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:23,560
And the, erm, the... the
children's, erm... their father?

94
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,160
I'm separated from Georgina's,

95
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,880
and Andre's was
killed in the war.

96
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,480
Hm.

97
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,320
So, you've done all
that on your own.

98
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,440
I've done nothing with my life,

99
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,840
except turn my father's
successful business

100
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,160
into a middling one.

101
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,880
You, on the other hand...
well, you're quite something.

102
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,400
Can I get you another drink?

103
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,360
I'm buying.

104
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,960
Oh! Sorry.

105
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,600
I suppose you're the hostess?

106
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,960
I'll have another gin and tonic.

107
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,040
As a matter of fact,
I'm an old has-been.

108
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,880
Two vermouths, please, and
who is that pompous arse?

109
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,840
Some racing driver.

110
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,800
You set out from home tonight
with a gun in your bag,

111
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,080
and you shot David Blakely.

112
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,520
That is correct.

113
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,600
Blakely was your lover.

114
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,960
Why did you want to kill him?

115
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,080
He hadn't picked me up
when he said he would.

116
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,480
He was drinking
with some friends,

117
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,640
and there was...

118
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,520
some other woman there.

119
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,680
I became very furious.

120
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,480
Where did you get the gun from?

121
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,000
It was given to me as
security in a club.

122
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,320
By whom?

123
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:02,000
A man. I don't
remember his name.

124
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,520
When was this?

125
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,600
About three years ago.

126
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,680
Mrs. Ellis, when you
put the gun in your bag,

127
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,320
did you intend to
kill Blakely with it?

128
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,040
Yes.

129
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,680
I left Andre at home,

130
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,720
I took the gun, and I got
in a taxi to Hampstead.

131
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,760
Andre... who's that?

132
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,080
My son.

133
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,160
Where's Andre now, Ruth?

134
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,800
Yes? Can I help you?

135
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,720
Detective Inspector Peter Gill.

136
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,520
Andre, the son of Mrs.
Ruth Ellis... where is he?

137
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
Here. It's room number five.

138
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,480
Mum?

139
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,800
It's alright, Andre.
Go back to sleep.

140
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,520
Hello?

141
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,720
I can't afford to pay
solicitor's fees, Mr. Bickford.

142
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,040
That's all in hand.

143
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,440
Mrs. Ellis, you have
signed a written statement

144
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,840
admitting your guilt
without any legal advice.

145
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,280
Well, I am guilty.

146
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,616
I've already agreed
to tell the court

147
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,280
I fully intended
to shoot David...

148
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,200
Stop there. Do you
feel quite well?

149
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,880
Have the police
treated you well?

150
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,320
Perfectly.

151
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,320
Ever been in any trouble
with them before?

152
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,360
Certainly not.

153
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,600
Why did you decide...

154
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,360
to do what you did
earlier tonight?

155
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,920
I was in a rage...

156
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,600
at the way David and his
friends were treating me...

157
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,920
laughing at me...

158
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,200
hanging up when I tried to
call, like I was nothing.

159
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,400
You killed him because he
wouldn't answer the phone?

160
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,920
When did you decide you
were going to do this?

161
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,120
Yesterday morning. I
hadn't been able to sleep.

162
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,960
I hadn't been able
to find David.

163
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,960
I suddenly had an overwhelming
and peculiar desire to kill him.

164
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,120
You thought he was
with another woman?

165
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,400
What, you lost control?

166
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,440
No, I saw things clearly
for the first time.

167
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,120
Has a doctor ever
treated you for...

168
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,880
mental instability?

169
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,336
I'm not cuckoo, if
that's what you mean.

170
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,760
No, no, no. Of
course, but it...

171
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,320
it's important that we explore

172
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,680
every possible line of defence.

173
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,160
You don't understand,
Mr. Bickford.

174
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,120
I'm not interested
in any defence.

175
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,960
You have admitted
to a capital crime.

176
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,920
Without mitigation,
without a defence,

177
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,800
any judge would be forced to...

178
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,080
To hang me. Yes.

179
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,360
I chose to do what I
did. I don't regret it.

180
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,960
I don't ask you or anyone
else to plead for my life.

181
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,760
An eye for an eye.

182
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,440
I took David's life.

183
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,880
I don't ask you to save mine.

184
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,720
Just over there
by the piano, Sam.

185
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,400
Lovely.

186
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,160
What do you think? Too much?

187
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,480
I think it's perfect.

188
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,560
Thanks, Jackie.

189
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,360
Almost.

190
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,120
Good evening. Welcome.

191
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,600
Ruth, you look wonderful.

192
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,200
Thank you.

193
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,880
Vicki...

194
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,000
What do you think?

195
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,280
Bloody gorgeous!

196
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,680
- Hello, Cooch.
- Hi.

197
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,440
- Champagne?
- Oh, please.

198
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,680
Champagne each for
the Vicki and Cooch.

199
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,680
I've seen you before.

200
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,720
You look...

201
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,440
different.

202
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,480
I was probably
rather rude to you.

203
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,560
I probably deserved it.

204
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,600
Can I buy you a drink?

205
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,640
I run this place, Mr. Blakely.
Let me get you one.

206
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,920
Well remembered.

207
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,440
I'm very good at my job.

208
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,000
Hm.

209
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,040
It's a little too much tonic.

210
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,160
Perhaps you should
go back to Carroll's.

211
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,960
Most nights I'm at the
Steering Wheel Club, actually.

212
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,520
I'm a...
- Racing driver, I know.

213
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,320
I expect you're waiting
for me to ask you about it.

214
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,120
I travel all over Europe. I
meet a lot of famous people.

215
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,640
You think I should go weak at
the knees for your little hobby.

216
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,880
I was once engaged to a
Canadian Airforce pilot.

217
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,440
Now, flying... that's something.

218
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,840
Not just racing toy cars.

219
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,280
Oh, believe me,
they're not toys.

220
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,320
Who's he? Your boyfriend?

221
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,400
Do you care?

222
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,960
Not particularly.

223
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,320
I think you do.

224
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,680
I think you came here for me.

225
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,200
I'm not taken by this little...

226
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,240
international playboy act.

227
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,360
I think you're a spoiled
brat spending Daddy's money,

228
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,120
and you are too used to
getting your own way.

229
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,280
I do always get my own way.

230
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,440
- This one's on me.
- Thank you.

231
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,600
Ruthie looking
after you alright?

232
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,600
Always.

233
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,280
You need some extra special
looking after, you let her know.

234
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,720
Oh, th-that's not, erm...

235
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,800
Have lunch with me tomorrow.

236
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,400
Gosh, I'm so busy
with the place, I...

237
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,040
You could bring
Andre and Georgina,

238
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,160
and we could do
whatever you want.

239
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,680
Andre has been going
on about the zoo.

240
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,360
The zoo it is.

241
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,880
Erm, I could, er,
pick you up at 10:00?

242
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,680
I haven't been able to
get you out of my mind.

243
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,840
I know.

244
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,600
You've been thinking
about me, too?

245
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,080
About what an arrogant
bastard you are.

246
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,280
It's all an act.

247
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,280
But you know that, don't you?

248
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,280
Because you are, too.

249
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,600
Mr. Bickford! Just in
time for Peter's round.

250
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,880
Have you dusted the
gun for fingerprints?

251
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,680
Whose prints would
we be looking for?

252
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,080
Half a dozen witnesses
saw her shoot Blakely.

253
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,000
Question is, who
gave her the gun?

254
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,760
She claims it was security
for a loan at the Little Club,

255
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,400
that she kept it in a
drawer for three years.

256
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,480
- And?
- We both know that can't possibly be true.

257
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,280
That gun hasn't been
sitting in a drawer.

258
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,200
It's in perfect working
condition. It's oiled.

259
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,080
You're a two-bob brief,
not an arms expert.

260
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,800
I prosecuted war
crimes in Austria.

261
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,880
Believe me, I know guns.

262
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,560
Does anything about this crime
make any sense to you at all?

263
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,440
A young woman with
no previous record,

264
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,280
never even fired a gun.

265
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,200
20 years of policing
have taught me

266
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,640
anyone is capable
of almost anything.

267
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:16,800
Have you conducted even the
most cursory investigation

268
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,560
into where she
obtained that gun?

269
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,320
What I am investigating is the
murder of an innocent young man.

270
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,480
And what interests me
are the four bullets

271
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,960
that that gun and your
client put into him.

272
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,480
Hey!

273
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,200
You know David went down
after the first shot?

274
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,880
He was on the ground when
she fired the next three.

275
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,560
Point-blank range.

276
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,400
Tell your client to
do the decent thing.

277
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,960
Spare his family a trial.

278
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,680
Ruth Ellis, you
have been charged

279
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,040
with the murder
of David Blakely.

280
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,440
You will appear in this court to
enter a plea in 10 days' time.

281
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,800
Until then, you will
be remanded in custody

282
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,480
at Holloway Women's Prison.

283
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,120
Where did the gun
come from, Ruth?

284
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,240
I told you, security for a loan.

285
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,720
If I'm to defend you, I need
you to be honest with me.

286
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,640
Honest, Mr. Bickford?

287
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,200
My parents had a visit from
a journalist at "The Mirror,"

288
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,760
says his newspaper are paying
my legal fees, your fees.

289
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,960
That's why you turned up
the night I was arrested...

290
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,040
because a tabloid
wants an exclusive.

291
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,760
Someone's put you up to this.

292
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:35,120
Someone gave you the gun,
and you're protecting them.

293
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,520
This way, Miss.

294
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,120
Look how long your
eyelashes are.

295
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,680
Are you wearing mascara?

296
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,040
I once threw a girl
in Frensham Ponds

297
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,240
for asking me that.

298
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,520
Naughty boy.

299
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,880
You don't know the half of it.

300
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,240
I heard you once drove a
Bentley around the Albert Hall

301
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,040
at 60 miles per hour.

302
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,120
Mm-hmm.

303
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,800
Didn't get caught, though.

304
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,840
I'm late.

305
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,680
Late for what?

306
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,760
Race meeting in Surrey.

307
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,000
Well, you can show me what
all the fuss is about then

308
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,440
with your toy cars.

309
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,720
Hmm?

310
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,520
I'll pack a champagne picnic.

311
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,400
Thank you.

312
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,040
Now, mind your fingers.
Alright, you all in?

313
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,640
Whoo!

314
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:27,160
It's a twin-cam version
of the 1500 Singer HRC.

315
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,680
Give me that.

316
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,160
Look, we call it "The Emperor."

317
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,840
This car is gonna make my name.

318
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,080
You don't believe me.

319
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,400
Hm.

320
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,600
- The Emperor has arrived.
- Ah, David.

321
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,520
...David, darling.
...Well, how's she running?

322
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,840
Like silk, old boy, like silk.

323
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,200
It's a beautiful day for it, eh?

324
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,640
- Good to see you, David.
- Hi.

325
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,840
Er, this is Clive Gunnell and Anthony Findlater.
- Hello.

326
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,440
Ant's been working
on the car with me.

327
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,536
Well, he's the money,
and I'm the brains.

328
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,800
- Hello.
- Hello.

329
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,840
And this is Carole Findlater.

330
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,880
Carole, Ruth Ellis. Ruth
works at the Little Club.

331
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,320
- Does she now?
- Manages it, actually.

332
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,240
We brought champagne.
- Ah.

333
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,120
- Let's crack it open, shall we?
- Good choice.

334
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,360
So, what did you
think of The Emperor?

335
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,800
Don't tell David, but I
thought it was thrilling.

336
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,240
You're very sweet.

337
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,200
- David! Stop that! Stop! David!
- Watch out.

338
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,120
Are they always like that?

339
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,280
Ant's never entirely
trusted him,

340
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,760
ever since...

341
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,760
Since what?

342
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:42,120
It's no secret. David
and I had a tendresse.

343
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,176
Oh, an affair, darling...
all very much in the past,

344
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,760
we laugh about it now,
but, well, I'm afraid

345
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,680
Ant never finds it very funny.

346
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:52,000
Carole, darling, we're off.

347
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,200
You know, I do hope
we see you again.

348
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,800
One never knows with David,

349
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:59,640
but I'm keeping my fingers
firmly crossed for you.

350
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,000
Coming!

351
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,680
David's being naughty.

352
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,280
I'm so sorry to put
you all through this.

353
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,040
You have to plead insanity.

354
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,240
I was sane when I did it.

355
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,600
I meant to do it. I won't lie.

356
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,400
What about Andre?

357
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,680
It'll be alright,
Mum. It's alright.

358
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,280
He's going to be taken care of.

359
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,800
It's all arranged.

360
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,600
Arranged with
who? Who? Ruthie!

361
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,400
She swears she was
sane when she did it.

362
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,280
And I know my daughter.

363
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,280
Stubborn as a mule
when she wants to be.

364
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,960
What's going to happen to her?

365
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,240
I need something...

366
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,520
to mount some sort of defence.

367
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,720
She won't tell me
where she got the gun.

368
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,560
And her reasons for
wanting Blakely dead

369
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,680
make precious little sense.

370
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,120
You know he knocked her about?

371
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,680
David was violent towards her?

372
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,560
She does pick 'em, our Ruth.

373
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,480
She has a history of
violent relationships?

374
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,040
Her ex-husband, George Ellis...

375
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,040
handy with his fists, too.

376
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,560
I don't know what went wrong.

377
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,320
She was such a...

378
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,720
happy little girl.

379
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,120
Ray of sunshine.

380
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,840
Are you alright, love?

381
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,920
Just get some water.

382
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,120
Muriel?

383
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,400
Is there anything
you can tell me

384
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,640
that might help your sister?

385
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,840
Muriel?

386
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,560
Ruth...

387
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,560
she lost a baby recently.

388
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,640
It was David's.

389
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,720
Stop! Terrible!

390
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,800
Jackie?

391
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,960
Jackie, will you
help Mr. Cussen?

392
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,560
- Come on.
- Yes, of course.

393
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,520
Not good for business...

394
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,520
favouring some punters,
neglecting others.

395
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,520
Go home to your wife, Morris.

396
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,840
Ah, lover boy doesn't
know, does he?

397
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,840
Her rate's 10 quid a night.

398
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,680
Worth every penny.

399
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,360
She asked you to leave.

400
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,160
Piss off, little
Lord Fauntleroy.

401
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,680
You know, I don't think I will.

402
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,960
I think I'll be staying
tonight and tomorrow night.

403
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,560
In fact, I'm moving in,

404
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,400
so there'll be no
more late-night calls

405
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,840
from you or any other
sweaty, old bastards,

406
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:04,960
unless you want my stepfather
to speak to his good friend,

407
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,800
the commissioner
at Scotland Yard,

408
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,880
and tell him you're
running a brothel.

409
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,160
Clean up the bar downstairs.

410
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,240
It's a bloody state!

411
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,160
Did you mean it?

412
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,800
I want to live with you.

413
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,520
So how many have
you had up here?

414
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,440
How many?

415
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,680
Men.

416
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:24,360
It's gonna have
to stop, you know?

417
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:28,240
'Cause I'm not gonna
be able to stand it.

418
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,040
I'm awfully afraid I'm
falling in love with you.

419
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,880
He beat you, didn't he?

420
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:48,400
"Body covered in large bruises
with the skin broken in places.

421
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,560
Temporary deafness in one ear.

422
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,680
Strangulation bruises on neck.

423
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,280
Recent pregnancy loss,

424
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,200
likely due to blows
to the abdomen."

425
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,560
This is what your
doctor recorded.

426
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,280
Why didn't you tell the police?

427
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,640
They never asked.

428
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:07,040
You lost a baby
because David beat you.

429
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,720
There are four
defences to murder...

430
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,160
self-defence, insanity,
proof you didn't do it.

431
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,760
But we can't use any of those.

432
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,880
The fourth is provocation.

433
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,040
If David did something
so terrible to you,

434
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,600
it caused you to
temporarily lose control,

435
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,080
that could be a defence.

436
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,280
Get back into bed now!

437
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,520
I didn't lose control.

438
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,560
If you could be honest
about what you've suffered,

439
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,000
if you can gain their sympathy,

440
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,720
then the jury could
recommend mercy.

441
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,240
I won't stand in a
courtroom and beg.

442
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,920
And I didn't kill David
because he beat me.

443
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,120
Why did you kill him?

444
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,200
You wouldn't understand.

445
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,520
You think I'm just a drab,
little man in a suit.

446
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,560
Perhaps I am.

447
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:13,760
But men like me... we've seen
things you can't imagine...

448
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:18,480
inconceivable acts of cruelty,
inconceivable suffering,

449
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:22,360
and always the impulse is
never to speak of it again,

450
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:26,120
because to speak of
it makes it real.

451
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:30,760
I know you're lying
about the murder.

452
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:34,160
You said it was a black cab
dropped you at the Magdala Pub,

453
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,160
but not one cabbie
has come forward.

454
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,920
I've met a lot of
London cabbies,

455
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,080
and they remember who's
in the back of their cars,

456
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,920
especially when they're
blondes all over the papers,

457
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,560
accused of murder.

458
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,080
Right.

459
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,280
That's all, Mr. Bickford.

460
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:02,960
Mr. Bickford? These
came for Mrs. Ellis.

461
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,600
She's sent these every day.

462
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:53,040
Mrs. Ellis has been
remanded in Holloway Prison,

463
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,000
charged with murder.

464
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:59,680
I have been instructed
to act as her solicitor.

465
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,600
I believe you're
a friend of hers.

466
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,760
More than a friend.

467
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,160
Well, I wouldn't say that.

468
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,560
Someone must have helped her.

469
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:11,160
Someone must have
given her a gun.

470
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,240
Was it you?

471
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,640
I have only her
interests in mind.

472
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,640
It was Desmond Cussen
gave you the gun,

473
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,400
drove you to the Magdala.

474
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,840
He confessed to me.

475
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,240
Wouldn't say much.

476
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,880
He's lying.

477
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,000
- I have to tell the police.
- No.

478
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,400
I'd be struck off. I
could be prosecuted.

479
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,360
I'll plead Not Guilty. That's
what you want, isn't it?

480
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,280
I will let you fight
my case in court.

481
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,680
But his name stays out of it.

482
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,280
I'd be committing a crime,

483
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,560
withholding Cussen's
confession from the police.

484
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:54,000
I-I could be seen
as an accessory

485
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,520
to murder after the fact.

486
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,040
You'd be committing perjury.

487
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,520
These are my terms.

488
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,200
Well, I can't accept them.

489
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,160
Fine. I never wanted a
lawyer, Mr. Bickford.

490
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,040
I want to plead Guilty.

491
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,520
But you are the one who is so
concerned with saving my life,

492
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,640
though I haven't
quite worked out why.

493
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,920
These terrible things you saw...

494
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,640
...I suppose they
happened in the war?

495
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,960
Was it you who did them?

496
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,600
So, this is all what?

497
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,680
Penance?

498
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:38,360
I'm sorry I wasn't able
to help you, Mrs. Ellis.

499
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,920
Mr. Bickford, I'll do it.
I'll do the trial your way.

500
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,480
You can use
provocation as defence.

501
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,280
You can go for manslaughter.

502
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,640
If we do this...

503
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,560
you must do everything I ask...

504
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,720
give evidence in
your own defence.

505
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,760
And his name stays out of it.

506
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,960
Knightsbridge 044.

507
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,240
- Jackie, it's Ruth.
- Ruth!

508
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,600
I need to know he's being
taken care of properly.

509
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,440
Who?

510
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,720
David.

511
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,560
What's your real voice?

512
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,680
What?

513
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,720
Your accent.

514
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,760
I know it's not this fake
telephone voice you put on.

515
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,000
Where did you grow up?

516
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,760
We moved around...

517
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,520
Manchester, Basingstoke.

518
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,720
I was born in Rhyl.

519
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,520
Mm-hmm.

520
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,800
I've never met anyone from Rhyl.

521
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,920
Hmm.

522
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,600
Well, we're a very exotic breed.

523
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,520
You're different to
the girls I know.

524
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,560
Carole?

525
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,840
That's all over.

526
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,840
It's you I want...

527
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,480
...and only you.

528
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,640
He won't give you what
you deserve, you know.

529
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,240
He'll never marry you.

530
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,416
Oh, for Christ's sake, who
said anything about marriage?

531
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,456
You could have everything you
want, everything the children want.

532
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,840
You could... You could
be set for life with me.

533
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,576
Desmond, how much have
you had to drink? Come on.

534
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,640
Who you are, what you do...

535
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,160
it doesn't matter to me.

536
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,800
But it does to him.

537
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,840
You don't know that.

538
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,920
I do.

539
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,760
He's engaged.

540
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,280
What is this?

541
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,720
Bugger off home
to bed, old chap.

542
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,880
No, you should leave.

543
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:49,200
You know you're a joke to her.

544
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,880
I flew Lancasters in the war.

545
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,480
I dropped bombs on
German children.

546
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,440
And for what?

547
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:03,480
To defend entitled
boys like you,

548
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,000
who take everything
that they want,

549
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,600
and they never give
a second's thought

550
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,160
to the people that they destroy.

551
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:12,200
Well, sooner or later,
the bill will come in.

552
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,960
Is it true?

553
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,960
It isn't real. It's...
It's for my mother.

554
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,040
For your mother?

555
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,720
Should have known that's
what you were doing here...

556
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,200
hiding from Mummy.

557
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,800
Stop it.

558
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,480
I was right about you...

559
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,840
playing with your toy cars.
Playing at being a man.

560
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,560
'Cause you're not, are you?

561
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,000
You're just a
frightened little boy.

562
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,920
"The Emperor"?

563
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,840
It's you that's the joke.

564
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,240
"Dear Mrs. Blakely.

565
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:17,000
No doubt these last few days
have been a shock to you."

566
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,920
"The two people I blame for
your son's death and my own

567
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,800
are his so-called
friends, the Findlaters."

568
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,360
"You will not
understand this yet,

569
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,400
but perhaps before
I hang, you will."

570
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,480
I'm so sorry.

571
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,560
"I implore you to forgive
David for living with me,

572
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:51,320
but we were very much in
love with one another.

573
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,520
Unfortunately, David
was not satisfied

574
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,600
with one woman in his life."

575
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,640
"I shall die loving your son."

576
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,560
"And you should feel content

577
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,880
that his death has been repaid."

578
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,240
It's alright.

579
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,360
It's alright.

580
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,320
"Goodbye.

581
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,960
Ruth Ellis."

582
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,320
It was Desmond Cussen
gave you the gun.

583
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,320
I have to tell the police.

584
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,120
No.

585
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:03,320
I'd be struck off. I
could be prosecuted.

586
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,720
I will let you fight
my case in court.

587
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,600
But his name stays out of it.

588
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,240
These are my terms.

589
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,720
Ruth Ellis...

590
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:37,280
you are charged with the
murder of David Blakely.

591
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,360
How do you plead?

592
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,640
Not Guilty.

593
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,280
They've called Desmond Cussen

594
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,240
as a witness for
the prosecution.

595
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,920
The prosecution? What do
they know about Desmond?

596
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,400
I don't know, but when
this goes to trial,

597
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,720
Desmond will be
speaking against you.

598
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,320
Everything he's seen you
suffer, we can't use it,

599
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,800
but it's not too late

600
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,560
to go to the police
and tell them about it.

601
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,640
There is nothing to tell.

602
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,400
There's something you
need to understand, Ruth.

603
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,960
You represent
everything they fear,

604
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,160
and they're going to
try to destroy you.

605
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,680
- "They"?
- The police, newspapers,

606
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,480
even the courts.

607
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,400
An ambitious woman, no
respect for class boundaries,

608
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:28,120
no respect for
sexual boundaries.

609
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:31,760
A mother who has, as they see
it, abandoned her children.

610
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:34,960
You have used everything
to try to advance yourself

611
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,640
at the expense of
everything they value,

612
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,200
and they won't
forgive you for it.

613
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,920
You're going to be on trial
for far more than murder.

614
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,560
And we will need to
use everything we have.

615
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,640
I won't betray anyone.

616
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:54,880
Well, then I hope to God
we can say the same of him.

617
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,720
It will all come
out at the trial...

618
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,640
what you put her through,
what you made her suffer.

619
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:15,600
Hey. Why put his family
through a pointless trial?

620
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,680
'Cause I believe she's
not guilty of murder.

621
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,480
You've seen the press here.

622
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:24,080
You know this'll be the biggest
case of both of our careers.

623
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,760
And I promise you,
I will see her hang.

624
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:30,720
Why has the Crown called
Desmond Cussen as a witness?

625
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,560
What's he given them?

626
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,680
See you in court.

627
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,440
I chose to do what I
did. I don't regret it.

628
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,520
David.

629
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:41,640
You are not trying
her for immorality...

630
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,400
but for murder.

631
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,960
He was... violent
on occasions.

632
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,760
Why did nobody
ask about the gun?

633
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:50,200
It is quite obvious when I shot
him, I intended to kill him.

634
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,280
I know she lied
about how she got it.

635
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:55,160
I will make him see
who and what you are.

636
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,200
Then you will have my
blood on your hands.

637
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,200
I know you think
you can save me.

638
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:03,960
Sleep with him again, and I
swear, I'll kill both of you.

639
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:07,480
She didn't carry out
this crime alone.

640
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:12,080
My job, my daughter,

641
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:16,240
my unborn child are all
gone because of him.

642
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:19,440
He does not get to
walk away. He doesn't!

643
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,760
You've perjured yourself
in the witness box.

644
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:25,520
You've condemned yourself.

645
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,760
People are on your side,
Ruth. They're getting angry.

646
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:30,000
What people?

647
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:32,160
Ellis! Evans! Bentley! Ellis!

648
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:35,080
You really think you can
take them all on and win?

649
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:38,560
You never really believed
you could save me, did you?

650
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,280
No matter what anyone
says or does now...

651
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,960
Call the bloody police.

652
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,960
If she isn't hanged
tomorrow, she never will be.

653
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:48,920
If we make enough
noise, we can stop this.

654
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,520
I don't want to die.

655
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:56,960
I don't want to die.
