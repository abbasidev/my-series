I've been
doing this for a week

6
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,480
and not making any headway.

7
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,560
Should've started
with the corners.

8
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,720
Thank you, Joy.

9
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,880
Morning
News. Get your news here.

10
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,920
Morning News.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,120
Morning News. Get
your news here.

12
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,680
Morning News.

13
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,640
They've
given us a date.

14
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,160
For Mr. Pierrepoint's
little visit, yes.

15
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,800
12 days.

16
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,720
And we can expect the
Home Secretary's decision

17
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,640
a-a couple of days before.

18
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,240
- Decision?
- On whether to reprieve,

19
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,360
postpone, or even cancel
your death sentence.

20
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:26,120
Now, a letter from you
would be an enormous help,

21
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,240
requesting compassion,

22
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,920
expressing, if not remorse,
then at least regret.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,080
I don't regret.

24
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,000
I won't lie, and I
certainly won't beg.

25
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,720
Nothing will be sent
to the Home Office.

26
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,800
No appeal, no
attempt to reprieve.

27
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,800
"And thine eyes shall not pity,

28
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,880
but life shall go for life,

29
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,720
eye for eye, tooth for tooth."

30
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,520
All I want is justice for David.

31
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,760
I'm due at the
Home Office in 72 hours

32
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,000
to submit her case.

33
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,920
The Secretary of State will make
his decision over the weekend.

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,040
What are you using?

35
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,880
For the
appeal? Her alcoholism...

36
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,480
and, uh, mental
breakdown, perhaps.

37
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,880
You're not thinking
of using him?

38
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,960
Ah, yes.

39
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,520
Desmond Cussen.

40
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,080
Look. Dragging him in now

41
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,720
will just makes it look
even more premeditated.

42
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,600
Not if he solicited
her to murder.

43
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,920
Desmond Cussen was
an RAF bomber pilot.

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,080
You know the casualty
rate of bomber crews.

45
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,280
Only one in four made
it through the war.

46
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,000
So we let him get
away with murder

47
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,040
because he was a war hero?

48
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,760
No doubt
he made mistakes...

49
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,880
getting too close to a
woman like Ellis for one.

50
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,200
Not that I'm judging her. But...

51
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,880
The world is the
way it is, John.

52
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,280
I could take this to the
Home Office right now.

53
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,360
And tell them what?

54
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,440
That you allowed your
client to perjure herself?

55
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,040
I could take it
to the newspapers.

56
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,480
And what a sheer, bloody
spectacle that would be.

57
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,360
You're like me, John.

58
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,280
We're both scholarship boys.

59
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,240
We both know the price of
admission for boys like us.

60
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,320
Ah.

61
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,080
I know alright.

62
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,080
Discretion.

63
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,680
And never, ever
frighten the horses.

64
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,280
That's why you brought
me here, isn't it?

65
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,120
To show me what I could win

66
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,160
if I'm a good little chap
and don't rock the boat?

67
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,440
But your problem is I don't care
about being part of the club,

68
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,920
one of the chaps.

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,760
You think this is all real,

70
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,040
that it matters.

71
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,240
This is nonsense!

72
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,480
That trial was a pantomime.

73
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,040
All of you in your
costumes and wigs...

74
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,880
absolute meaningless nonsense.

75
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,856
- Steady, Bickford.
- Right now I feel like

76
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,960
I could blow this whole thing up

77
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,640
and damn the consequences.

78
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,040
You really think you can
take them all on and win?

79
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,880
You concealed material facts.

80
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,760
You made yourself an
accessory to murder.

81
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,640
Now, you can destroy
yourself and her,

82
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,520
or you can take her one
chance at a reprieve.

83
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,920
For her sake and yours,

84
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,480
go for madness.

85
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,000
But she isn't mad.

86
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,720
Mental strain
exacerbated by the miscarriage

87
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,200
and her alcoholism.

88
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,000
She won't like it.

89
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,320
It's the best case
we have for mercy.

90
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,400
What about Desmond Cussen?

91
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,440
I think Ruth herself

92
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,800
is where we should
concentrate our efforts.

93
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,456
Jackie Dyer's
gone to the police.

94
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,120
She's made a statement
about the gun

95
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,200
and the... the cab that
Desmond used to drive.

96
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,256
Why aren't we using that?
- Don't badger the man, Muriel.

97
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,000
Well, there's something
he's not telling us.

98
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,480
I can assure you, it's
all been looked into.

99
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,480
Now, if you'll excuse me.

100
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,560
Why aren't we using Cussen?

101
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,040
Mr. Cussen?

102
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,480
DCI Davies, Met Police.

103
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,600
Can we have a word?

104
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,360
So you've no idea

105
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,920
why this woman, Jacqueline
Dyer, has made these claims?

106
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,800
I suppose a-a
misguided attempt to...

107
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,280
help Mrs. Ellis.

108
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,280
Who's made no effort
whatsoever to help herself.

109
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,240
Mrs. Ellis has made
our job extremely easy.

110
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,160
It's as open and shut a
case as... as I ever saw.

111
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,440
And she hasn't fought it.

112
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,600
Why?

113
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,520
She's a young mother.

114
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,360
No criminal record.

115
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,400
Every reason to ask for mercy.

116
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,480
But she hasn't.

117
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,640
She is going like a
lamb to slaughter.

118
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,400
I know you've been letting
Blakely drink for free

119
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,480
for months.

120
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,560
You let him destroy this club

121
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,160
and make fools of both of us.

122
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,760
I'm gonna need the flat back.

123
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,160
You're sacking me?

124
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,640
I'll give you till
the end of the week.

125
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,920
I've got nowhere to go.

126
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,680
We can
work something out.

127
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,240
You know I'll always
look after you, Ruthie.

128
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,680
Aah!

129
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,360
You will never touch me again.

130
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,376
I'm afraid the divorce
settlement from George Ellis

131
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,640
leaves you with...

132
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,120
Bugger all. I know.

133
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,160
Unless you want to take
Mr. Ellis to court,

134
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,280
which I would still strongly
urge you to consider.

135
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,520
No. Thank you, Mr. Mishcon.

136
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,720
Well...

137
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,560
...one signature...

138
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,880
and you are very
nearly a free woman.

139
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,080
So...

140
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,800
what are you going to
do with your liberty?

141
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,080
Look for a place
to live, find a job.

142
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,080
Thank you.

143
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,040
Mrs. Ellis...

144
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,840
do you have somewhere to stay?

145
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,240
I have a friend.

146
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,720
Ruth...

147
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,240
...you have a little boy.

148
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,640
Mrs. Ellis?

149
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,840
Are you alright?

150
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,360
Can you please turn
the light off, Joy?

151
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,080
- I can't sleep.
- I'm sorry.

152
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,480
You know I'm not
allowed to do that.

153
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,880
No more hostessing.

154
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,040
I'll get a job in an office.

155
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,600
I've already taken up a
course of French lessons.

156
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,000
I've always wanted to talk
dirty in two languages.

157
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,120
I'm moving in with Desmond.

158
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,880
What?

159
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,720
Temporarily, just
while I look for a job.

160
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,600
Why didn't you ask if you
could move in with me?

161
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,240
- What happened?
- I said...

162
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,800
why didn't you ask if
you can move in with me?

163
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,720
Because you live
with your parents.

164
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,920
Since you're too spineless
to admit my existence...

165
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,840
Is it any wonder I lose my rag
when you push me like this?

166
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,640
Take your hands off me.

167
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,680
I said take your
hands off me now.

168
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,600
I'm moving in with Desmond

169
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,496
because I have a son who
needs a roof over his head

170
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,096
and I've already given
up one child for you.

171
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,920
Let me know when
you've got the balls

172
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,480
to introduce me to your mother.

173
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,400
Excuse me. May I have
the bill, please?

174
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,320
Sleep with him again

175
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,480
and I swear I'll
kill both of you.

176
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,440
Thank you.

00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,520
No. No, thank you.

182
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,896
- Reprieve Ruth Ellis...
- No, no.

183
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,560
- I'll sign it.
- Oh, thank you.

184
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,080
It's barbaric what
they're doing to her.

185
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,720
I just want to save my friend.

186
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,000
I might
be able to help.

187
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,200
I understand you've given a
new statement to the police.

188
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,920
You're a journalist.

189
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,560
Jayveer Sethia.

190
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,880
I heard they've taken
someone in for questioning

191
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,640
about the black cab and the gun.

192
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,280
Have they made an arrest?

193
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,040
The people are
on her side, Mrs. Dyer.

194
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,160
If we make enough
noise, we can stop this.

195
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,960
But I need to know who
she's keeping out of this.

196
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,800
Whoever it is, the police
knew about him already.

197
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,280
They took a statement from
Ruth's French teacher weeks ago

198
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,520
who said she knew who
gave Ruth the gun.

199
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,560
I've been looking for her
so I can get his name.

200
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,600
But the police...

201
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,320
They've known all along.

202
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,800
Ruth?

203
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,320
I hope you like lamb
chops and new potatoes.

204
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,240
Bollocks to love.
You're not in love.

205
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,816
How would you know?
You've never been in it.

206
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,000
No, thank God.

207
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,560
Biggest con ever pulled.

208
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,960
Bit of pillow talk,

209
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,256
then 60 years of
ironing his pants.

210
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,880
What about you and Cooch?

211
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,240
A diamond like that, he
wants something in return.

212
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,240
Yes, and he gets it...

213
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,640
My body.

214
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,040
My smile.

215
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,600
But not my soul.

216
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,760
He knows that.

217
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,480
Your trouble is, you
let them in here.

218
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,000
David's passionate.

219
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,560
And I give as good as I get.

220
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,440
- You deserve better.
- I'd die of boredom.

221
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,080
If you could be anywhere,
doing anything right now,

222
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,400
what would it be?

223
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,160
Driving a big "fuck
off" silver Cadillac

224
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,800
down Sunset Boulevard.

225
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,480
Oh! Hello, Hollywood!

226
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,160
Always fancied America...

227
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,280
big cars, big, open roads.

228
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,000
Well, we could do it, you know?

229
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,280
We should. Why not?

230
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,440
Let's just book the
tickets, and let's do it.

231
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,120
Right. Well, at least
screw someone, then.

232
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,120
- Hey, hey!
- Whoo!

233
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,480
Hmm?

234
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,800
Christ, you're pretty.

235
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,840
It's fine.

236
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,040
Here she is.
Good morning, Ruth.

237
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,400
Your French tutor's here.

238
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,656
She's been here
for half an hour.

239
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,960
So sorry.

240
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,360
If you just give
me one minute...

241
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,440
just one minute... sorry.

242
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,320
Is everything alright?

243
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,720
Fine.

244
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,880
I stayed at Jackie's.

245
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,960
You know what the
girls are like.

246
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,600
Terrible racket.

247
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,680
We have the same
problem at home.

248
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,960
Filthy pigeons.

249
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,440
You need to borrow this.

250
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,160
Ruth's French
tutor saw it on his desk

251
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,880
and gave a sworn statement

252
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,840
that she could identify
the gun in court.

253
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,920
I believe she saw
a starter pistol

254
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,360
that Mr. Cussen
kept in his flat.

255
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,240
She saw
a large revolver.

256
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,920
A starter pistol

257
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,680
that Cussen surrendered to
us freely for examination.

258
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,280
As to the taxi cab,

259
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,640
he said he gave that to
his brother last year,

260
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,960
months before Mrs. Ellis
committed the murder.

261
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,560
Couldn't possibly have
driven her to the Magdala.

262
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,120
Have
you verified that?

263
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,080
We interviewed
Mr. Cussen at length

264
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,360
as to your claims.

265
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,040
Everything I told
you, you already knew.

266
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,000
I understand you want
to help your friend.

267
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,040
And that is admirable.

268
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,200
But nothing you can
do can change the fact

269
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,760
Mrs. Ellis murdered David
Blakely in cold blood.

270
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,440
Hey. You want her
dead. All of you.

271
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,760
I want justice for
Blakley's family.

272
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,840
It stinks, Ruth.

273
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,800
The whole thing stinks.

274
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,360
The police have
covered things up...

275
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,776
evidence that would
have helped you,

276
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,280
that linked Cussen to the gun.

277
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,320
I said I didn't want
you going to the police.

278
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,120
If his involvement was known,

279
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,240
it would mean a
retrial at least.

280
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,280
Desmond is innocent.

281
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,840
Then why hasn't he visited
you once since the trial?

282
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,480
Jackie...

283
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,880
If it came out,
everything would change.

284
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,760
People are on your side,
Ruth. They're getting angry.

285
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,240
All the people I've
spoken to agree.

286
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,760
What people?

287
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,120
I've been campaigning for you.

288
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,720
A petition.
- What?

289
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,720
And these are
letters of support.

290
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,280
Jackie, I told you.

291
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,800
I told I didn't want this.

292
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,496
I didn't want people out
there begging for me.

293
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,440
People feel for you, Ruth.

294
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,480
They feel...
- They feel pity.

295
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,040
I would rather them think I was
a cold-hearted, murdering bitch

296
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,800
with no regrets.

297
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,680
- But that's not who you are.
- Isn't it?

298
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,560
Perhaps it's just easier
for you to think that.

299
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,160
Oh, poor, little Ruth.

300
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,760
David mistreated
her so terribly.

301
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,240
She lost her mind.
She had no choice.

302
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,960
I chose to make him die on
the ground in front of me.

303
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,736
Maybe it's
easier for you to think that,

304
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,760
to make yourself
believe you deserve it.

305
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,440
But that's the coward's way out,

306
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,776
to give up rather than fighting.
- Get out.

307
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,160
Get out, and don't
visit me again.

308
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,240
They're
going to kill you, Ruth.

309
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,800
And you're just as bad as them for letting it...
- How dare you!

310
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,600
Get out! And take those
fucking things with you!

311
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,720
Get out!

312
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,120
This is
bigger than her now.

313
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,160
It's about Timothy
Evans and Derek Bentley.

314
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,960
It's about the whole business

315
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,840
of whether the state should
go on merrily hanging people,

316
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,360
only to later discover that
maybe they weren't guilty.

317
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,800
The government is nervous.

318
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,920
They've promised law and order.

319
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,760
But the abolitionists are
knocking at the gates.

320
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,840
And then what's next?

321
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,640
The homosexuals?

322
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,720
The abortionists?

323
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,560
So that's why they
want her dead.

324
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,320
I just need a name.

325
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,280
But if no one will help her
and she won't help herself...

326
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,120
Then you have to.

327
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,840
Desmond Cussen.

328
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,040
Ruth Ellis' lover?

329
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,760
Gave her the gun,

330
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,320
drove her to the scene of
the murder in a black cab.

331
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,760
Her friend, Jacqueline
Dyer, is certain.

332
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,240
Yeah, well, our libel
lawyers are busy enough, son.

333
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,040
- She hangs in 10 days.
- Bound to be reprieved.

334
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,120
90% of women are.

335
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,560
And what if she's not

336
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,640
and Desmond Cussen
gets away with it?

337
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,680
30 million newspapers bought
every Sunday in this country,

338
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,680
bought for two reasons...
sex and hanging.

339
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,240
You're not here to fight
crime. You're here to sell it.

340
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,640
Come back to me with
proof and we can talk.

341
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,880
Hello, yes.

342
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,680
I'm calling about
my son, Andre Ellis.

343
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,080
I want to check his school fees
for the term had been paid.

344
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,280
Right.

345
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,056
Thank you. I'll make
sure a cheque is sent

346
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,160
as soon as possible.

347
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,800
Ruth...

348
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,040
let me look after you all.

349
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,800
He will look after him.

350
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,600
He promised, whatever happens,
he will look after him.

351
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,200
I swear it.

352
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,280
He will look after him.

353
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,520
- I swear it.
- He will look after him.

354
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,640
He promised.

355
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,880
I swear it.

356
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,200
I was thinking...

357
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,000
about a holiday.

358
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,840
Get Andre out of London.

359
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,680
Scotland, I thought. I
could teach him to fish.

360
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,400
David would lose his mind.

361
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,840
Let me deal with him.

362
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,960
It's a Christmas present.

363
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,880
Since you got me
this exquisite tie.

364
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,440
- Same again?
- Please.

365
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,560
Merry Christmas, Ruth.

366
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,360
What are you doing here?

367
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,800
I haven't slept with him,

368
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,256
if that's what
you're worried about.

369
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,280
Look at you.

370
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,560
Drunk...

371
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,680
whilst your son is alone
at home on Christmas night.

372
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,200
You're an embarrassment.

373
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,280
What are
you doing here?

374
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,480
I'm wishing Merry
Christmas to my fiancée.

375
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,160
Mm.

376
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,160
Let go of her.

377
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,600
You have no idea, do you...

378
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,400
...what she really
thinks about you...

379
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,640
the contempt she feels for you?

380
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,240
Stop!

381
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,400
You little
bastard.

382
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,840
Outside.

383
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,480
Now.

384
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,920
Outside?

385
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,040
How about hitting a man
instead of a woman for once?!

386
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,800
It's over, you and Ruth.

387
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,640
You lost.

388
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,760
I know you're bored out
of your skull with him.

389
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,000
This is what you need.

390
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,520
This is who you are.

391
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,840
Please.

392
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,960
Please, turn the light off.

393
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,320
Is it true that you have
all been campaigning for me?

394
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,040
I told you,

395
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,360
no begging, no pleading!

396
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,120
You've seen what they've
written about you.

397
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,920
I don't care
what they write!

398
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,800
I want my sentence
to take its course!

399
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,480
You will not go to
the Home Office.

400
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,880
I will not die with
this world thinking

401
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,400
I am some beaten, little fool!

402
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,360
- Well, that's it, then.
- That is justice.

403
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,680
An eye for an eye,

404
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,840
as I have said from the start.

405
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,920
"An eye for an eye."

406
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,080
Yes.

407
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,080
You know...

408
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:44,560
...I was in Austria
just after the war.

409
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,360
I was a prosecutor
in the British Zone,

410
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,480
and I prosecuted a
young German soldier.

411
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:54,320
His unit had been
moving Hungarian Jews

412
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,000
in what later became
called the death marches.

413
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,560
And these prisoners
were exhausted,

414
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,640
barely able to walk.

415
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,680
And he was ordered to
shoot anyone that fell.

416
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,680
And at first he refused,

417
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,520
but eventually,

418
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,560
he shot two men.

419
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,440
And after the war,

420
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,720
we tried him for murder,
and we hanged him.

421
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:23,320
One week after he
committed those crimes

422
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,040
in March 1945,

423
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,200
the Soviets liberated Vienna.

424
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,320
They were out for
revenge, mainly drunk,

425
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,520
terrorising the city.

426
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,560
Perhaps a hundred-thousand
women were raped.

427
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:44,720
Not one single charge was
brought against any of them.

428
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,760
Because they were on our side.

429
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,000
Justice isn't real, Ruth.

430
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,280
It's a story written
by the winners.

431
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,680
I'm not certain of much, but...

432
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,920
I know you don't deserve
to die for what you did.

433
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,320
You will look after him.

434
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,280
You promise. Whatever happens.

435
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,480
I swear it.

436
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,520
John...

437
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,600
He made certain promises.

438
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,360
Desmond?

439
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,400
He promised to look after Andre.

440
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,680
And I don't think he's going to.

441
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,320
I told you he gave me the gun.

442
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,280
Perhaps it's time to use that.

443
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,040
We can't.

444
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,560
You know we can't.

445
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,560
It's too late.

446
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,240
You told me you wanted
me to tell them.

447
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,920
Ruth, a better way...

448
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,200
is to go for the violence,
your miscarriage...

449
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,720
what David did to you,

450
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,960
the... the child
you would have had.

451
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,120
I think I'm pregnant.

452
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,080
Only a couple of weeks
but I can feel it.

453
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,600
Christ.

454
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:43,480
I'll call Dr Jameson.
Make an appointment.

455
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:51,560
It's really no worse
than getting a tooth out.

456
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:56,840
I don't want you
to get rid of it.

457
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,080
Don't you?

458
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,160
But no more Desmond Cussen.

459
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:12,080
We find somewhere to live.

460
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,160
As a family.

461
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,040
And we visit my mother

462
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,480
and tell her we're
getting married.

463
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,000
Alright then.

464
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:51,000
I still don't understand why
you can't stay here with me.

465
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,896
Well, if you and I are to
have a future together,

466
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,760
I need to build up
my own life first.

467
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,520
My independence.

468
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,720
A home for Andre.

469
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,040
I've found a bed sitting room.

470
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,720
It's cheap.

471
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,040
Look, I know how much I've
already asked of you...

472
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,920
How much do you need?

473
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,040
We would like the
Home Secretary to consider

474
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,320
provocation in the
case of Ruth Ellis.

475
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:26,720
She was suffering enormously
at the time of the offence.

476
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,920
She had had a miscarriage
caused by Blakely's violence.

477
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,320
It wasn't fully
explored at trial.

478
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,440
And there's a petition.

479
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,800
50,000 signatories,
from Australia,

480
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,200
America, France, Germany.

481
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,200
And, err, hundreds of letters.

482
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,560
I hope the Home Secretary
will consider them.

483
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,960
Well, they are not
all in Mrs. Ellis's favour.

484
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,880
"I am married to a
woman similar in nature

485
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,296
to Ruth Ellis... eaten up with
jealousy through and through.

486
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,400
I greatly fear that my future
safety would be at stake

487
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,520
if you granted a reprieve".

488
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,880
And many women express concern

489
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,376
that clemency should
not be granted merely

490
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,480
because she is female.

491
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,576
I hope the Home Secretary
will concentrate on the facts.

492
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,240
The facts are simple.

493
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:15,400
Mrs. Ellis committed a
firearms murder in cold blood.

494
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,120
There may have
been other factors.

495
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,200
Such as?

496
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,840
She will not act
to save herself.

497
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,240
She will not let
me act to help her.

498
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:35,600
She practically wouldn't let me
to put her case in front of you.

499
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,720
She's determined to die

500
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:43,240
because she feels like her
life is not worth saving.

501
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,200
You must act now, in
the name of justice.

502
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,480
In the name of mercy. She
will hang in five days.

503
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,240
I just need more time.

504
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,080
For God's sake, a...
a... a bit more time.

505
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:06,440
Forgive me, sir.

506
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,040
I'm sorry.

507
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,520
I will speak to
the Home Secretary.

508
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,840
He's not without compassion.
Quite the opposite.

509
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:23,240
Have you heard of a
woman called Sarah Lloyd?

510
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,200
Who?

511
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,480
She's a woman on death
row at Strangeways.

512
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,120
She was convicted for the murder

513
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,720
of an elderly neighbour
with a shovel.

514
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,800
Due to be hanged in two days.

515
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,240
But Lloyd George has
just reprieved her.

516
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:41,360
Provocation over time wasn't
a factor in her conviction

517
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,280
but it has been a
factor in her reprieve.

518
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,800
So that's good, isn't it?

519
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,400
It could be bloody brilliant.

520
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,480
God.

521
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,640
And it all belongs
to your parents?

522
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,880
Yes, all theirs.

523
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,880
It's a bit suburban, really.

524
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:14,880
Still it's nice to
have the tennis court.

525
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,040
You nervous?

526
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,440
A bit.

527
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,480
Well, I tell you what.
Let's go grab a drink first.

528
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,040
Hm?

529
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,120
Alright.

530
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,560
Your friends are here.

531
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,000
Oh, we often
drink here on Sundays.

532
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:47,200
Then roll up at my parents'
demanding roast beef.

533
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,160
Look, just a quick one, promise.

534
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,200
- Oh, here he is. Hello.
- Oh, David.

535
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,120
Well, I thought
I'd come a bit early.

536
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,360
Hello.
How was the drive?

537
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,200
Oh, it was alright.

538
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,640
And the maître d' says
to him, "I'm sorry, sir,

539
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:07,000
these tables are reserved
for the race car drivers",

540
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:10,360
and Ant just looks at him and
says "Now look here, old chap,

541
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,160
we are the bloody race.

542
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,296
- Now bring us some champagne".
- Bring us some champagne.

543
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,360
You would
have been so proud.

544
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,720
Have you been to Le Mans?

545
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,400
No, I've never been to France.

546
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,000
I've never actually been abroad.

547
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,840
Perhaps he'll take you.

548
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,760
For your honeymoon.
Well, he told us.

549
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,680
Congratulations.
Come on, a toast.

550
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,680
For the soon-to-be Mr. And
Mrs. David Blakely!

551
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,040
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

552
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,080
Mr. and
Mrs. David Blakley.

553
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,256
And you'd better make
sure you take the bins out on time.

554
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,440
Or she'll sending the gangsters
round to make sure you do!

555
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,840
What?

556
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,360
Come along, we should go.

557
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,080
We don't want to keep
your mother waiting.

558
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,960
Yes, quite right, mustn't
keep Annie waiting.

559
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,280
No, I tell you what. Why
don't I go and get her

560
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,040
and bring her back for
a G&T before lunch.

561
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,000
Well, no, I'll come.

562
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,920
No. You stay.

563
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Have fun.

564
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,000
I'm sorry about all that.
They can be so childish.

565
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,760
What did they mean?
About the gangsters?

566
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,840
When David was attacked,
he had this idea...

567
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,560
perhaps it was just a joke...

568
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,560
that you'd sent
the men to do it.

569
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,160
- It wasn't me.
- David's no angel.

570
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:39,160
God knows he deserves a
black eye now and then.

571
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,480
He'll never introduce you
to his mother, you know.

572
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:47,720
We're getting married.
We're actually...

573
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,840
We're actually having a baby.

574
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,960
No, you're
having a baby.

575
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,000
It's not a judgement,
simply a fact.

576
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,920
David will never truly
know if the baby is his.

577
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,240
Did he say that?

578
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,656
I'm not
trying to be cruel.

579
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,600
What you and David
have, it isn't love.

580
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:07,560
It's a trap, for both of you.
And my advice is get out now.

581
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,920
David! Didn't
your mother fancy a drink?

582
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,960
No, she
was... she was busy.

583
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,840
You're a cruel
little coward, David.

584
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,560
I'll drive you back to London.

585
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,560
Thank you.

586
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,520
Least I could do.

587
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,000
I've got a bottle of gin inside

588
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,080
if you want to come
in for a drink?

589
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,800
How far along are you, anyway?

590
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,200
- About six weeks.
- Gosh.

591
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:02,400
The taste of gin would have
made me heave at six weeks.

592
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,480
Strong stomach.

593
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:11,960
Ruth, Ruth, the
evening paper's in.

594
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:16,680
I'm so sorry. It's
your friend Vicki.

595
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:03,680
Mrs. Ellis. The decision's in.

596
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,000
From the Home Secretary.

597
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,080
On your reprieve.

598
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,280
"I have been pressed
from many quarters

599
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:18,240
to exercise clemency
in this case,

600
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,120
on the grounds of the prisoner's
sex and of her yielding to

601
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,880
jealousy, which is
alleged by some people

602
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,920
to be stronger in
women than in men".

603
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:41,680
Are you going
to get up today?

604
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,840
It was Vicki's 13th
accident in 4 years.

605
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,920
When your time's up, it's up.

606
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,000
Where've you been?

607
00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:00,720
If you must know, I stayed
at Carole and Ant's.

608
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,920
Course you did.

609
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,560
You haven't
been to the Doctor

610
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,040
about your pregnancy
yet, have you?

611
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,880
Not yet.

612
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:17,680
You should be,
what, 10 weeks now?

613
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,760
I spoke to Carole about it all.

614
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,960
She said your symptoms
are all wrong.

615
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:29,200
That it's all very convenient,
forcing us to get married.

616
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,800
And I think she's right.

617
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,600
It's not just the accent,

618
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,240
the hair that's fake, is it?

619
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,080
You're not really
pregnant, are you?

620
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,760
What?!

621
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,640
"There may be
circumstances in a capital case

622
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,080
where special conditions
apply to a woman

623
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,760
which would not be applicable
in the case of a man.

624
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:58,840
One recent example is
that of Mrs. Sarah Lloyd.

625
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,960
I can find no such
circumstances, however,

626
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,640
in the present case".

627
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,136
After everything
I've done for you.

628
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,120
Brought you into my world.

629
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,440
Loved you. Fucking
worshipped you.

630
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,120
And all along you were
working out how to trap me.

631
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,360
- That's not true.
- Hmm. You had me beaten.

632
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,520
- I didn't...
- To scare me into thinking

633
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,520
I could never leave.
- I didn't do that...

634
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,080
And then you went to
work on my honour.

635
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,120
Knowing I'd never abandon you

636
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,600
if you were having a child.

637
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,800
David, I am
pregnant. I swear...

638
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,120
"The crime
was a deliberate one

639
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,120
and was carried out
with premeditation.

640
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:48,400
The prisoner has
expressed no remorse.

641
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,280
I can find nothing

642
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:53,880
to justify my taking a
less serious view than

643
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:58,600
of other cases of such a
callous and calculated nature".

644
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,600
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Don't let me do it.

645
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,600
Oh, God, don't let me do it.

646
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,920
"The trial
judge has told me

647
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,760
that he can suggest no
mitigating circumstances,

648
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:13,280
and that he himself was not
able to find any grounds

649
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:17,240
for proposing that clemency
would be appropriate".

650
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,280
"After much
anxious thought,

651
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,240
I have come to the conclusion

652
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,280
that the law should be
allowed to run its course".

653
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,680
One of these days
I will kill you.

654
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,880
You've already done that.

655
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:49,560
The sentence
will be carried out.

656
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,800
Two days from now.

657
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,720
Well, I bet Mummy
has really missed you.

658
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,480
Andre, go and play.

659
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,720
Go on.

660
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,880
It's all I could do.

661
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,600
Maybe now you can
get some sleep.

662
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,360
I don't want to die.

663
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,520
I don't want to die.

664
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,080
I don't want to die.

665
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:18,440
I don't want to die.

666
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:33,480
I know what you want to ask.

667
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,480
Why don't I just
bloody leave him.

668
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,720
I don't
have to ask that.

669
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,960
Not after Dad.

670
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,640
George.

671
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,760
You've never known
any different.

672
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,280
Don't think you
deserve any different.

673
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,536
You said it
would be enough.

674
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,240
The violence. The miscarriage.

675
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,080
You told me it would be
enough for a reprieve.

676
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:24,280
The game is rigged, Ruth.

677
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,280
Why did you tell
me to keep quiet?

678
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,080
- Because it was too late.
- For who?

679
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,280
For you?

680
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,800
You chose to perjure yourself

681
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,280
and make me an
accessory to murder.

682
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,440
You promised that
you would help me.

683
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,360
But you haven't.

684
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:43,400
Every step of the way,
you have made it harder

685
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:46,480
and harder for me to
help save your life.

686
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,920
And I've never understood why.

687
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,840
Do you know about what
George used to do?

688
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,200
He used to get blackout drunk.

689
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,200
And when he would come home,
it would always be my fault,

690
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,800
and he would belt me.

691
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,080
And people would
always say to me,

692
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:15,520
"What do you do to
drive him to it?

693
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,960
What do you do to
drive them all to it?"

694
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:22,000
Because you know every
man I have ever been with

695
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,240
has turned out the same.

696
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:28,600
Drunk. Violent.

697
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:32,480
And it must've been my fault
because it kept on happening.

698
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:37,280
Different man, same thing.

699
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:40,800
I tried so hard to escape it.

700
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,680
I changed my voice,
changed the way I look.

701
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,480
I worked and I worked.

702
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:54,480
The youngest club
manager in London.

703
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:59,360
And I thought I'd done it.

704
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,200
And then David turned up.

705
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,120
And he was worse
than all of them.

706
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,856
And I thought there
must be something in me

707
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:12,320
that is pulled towards
them, towards men like him.

708
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,480
I just didn't know what.

709
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,160
And then when he was dead...

710
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,040
...the police and the
papers and the lawyers,

711
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:29,160
they all made sense
of it for me, at last.

712
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:33,760
I had my answer.

713
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:37,160
The reason I couldn't escape it

714
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:40,760
was because it was what
was always meant for me.

715
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,320
A common little tart,

716
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,000
worth nothing to
anyone except the price

717
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,880
she can charge for a night

718
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,000
finally getting what
she had coming to her.

719
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:56,080
And I would still believe that,

720
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,480
if it weren't for you.

721
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,920
But you gave me hope.

722
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,200
Hope that I could live.

723
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,400
That I didn't deserve to die.

724
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,880
You're scared of
them, aren't you?

725
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:21,680
All those men you talked
about that could destroy me.

726
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:28,480
You never really believed
you could save me, did you?

727
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:39,320
I'll be appointing
a new solicitor.

728
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,720
Goodbye, Mr. Bickford.

729
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,960
You found your husband
in the marital bed

730
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,320
with a lady who goes by
the professional moniker

731
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,040
"Madame Feather".

732
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:18,960
- That's right.
- He has agreed to a divorce.

733
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,760
You say you only want
what's rightfully yours.

734
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,960
Yes.

735
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,360
Mr. Mishcon's office.

736
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,000
We'll get you the
whole bloody lot.

737
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,280
Thank you.

738
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,680
Telephone
for you, sir.

739
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,000
It's Holloway prison.

740
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,200
Bickford?

741
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:52,400
I'm Victor Mishcon. I
handled Ruth's divorce.

742
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,840
I believe she's asked for me.

743
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,760
Why has she fired you?

744
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,080
I've been carrying a
bomb in my briefcase.

745
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:06,120
And I didn't have the
guts to detonate it.

746
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,360
Try to get her to tell
you about the gun.

747
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:20,080
Mrs. Ellis.

748
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,960
I believe you have
something to tell me

749
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,120
that might save your life.
