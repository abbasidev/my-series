1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,400
I don't know.

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,435
Just come out.

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,800
I prefer the last one.

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,037
Me, too. It's a bit more subtle.
- Elegant, yeah.

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,560
It's these bits, isn't it?
- Yep. Yeah. Last one, definitely.

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,750
Yep. Great.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,440
I'm really pleased with that.
- Yeah.

8
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,756
Once it's nipped in there.
- Oh, it'll perfect.

9
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,080
His arms.

10
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,674
Do you prefer weddings
or funerals?

11
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,240
Weddings. His arms.

12
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,136
I think there's something
humbling about funerals.

13
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,834
Really?
- Yeah, it's good to dwell on the next life.

14
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,273
You really think
there's a next life?

15
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,272
What do you believe? Worm food?

16
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,638
Mm.
- Why?

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,154
Why what? His neck.

18
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,311
Why would you believe
in something awful

19
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,358
when you can believe
in something wonderful?

20
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,760
Oh, don't make me an optimist.

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,071
You will ruin my life.

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,191
Have you been to many funerals?
- A couple.

23
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,032
His neck.
- And you never felt them go somewhere?

24
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,277
No, they were already gone.
His beautiful neck.

25
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,670
What?

26
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,037
What?
- You just said, "His beautiful neck."

27
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,511
No, I, no, I-I said
th-that they were already gone.

28
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,960
OK. Weird.

29
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,874
Oh, right, so...

30
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,560
This might be your idea of Hell

31
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,598
but I think it's kind of special.

32
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,314
His beautiful neck.

33
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,680
Quaker meeting.

34
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,830
You're not allowed to speak.

35
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,480
If the Spirit moves you to speak

36
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,631
you have to stand up
and share it with everyone.

37
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,280
It's very intense.

38
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,280
It's very quiet.

39
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,550
It's very, very...

40
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,996
erotic.

41
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,400
Oh.

42
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,400
I think...

43
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,914
I'm going to go home
in November.

44
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,320
I think.

45
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,760
What's he thinking?

46
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,796
What's he thinking?

47
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,193
I don't really think it's...
I'm not really feeling... the...

48
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,096
it's not anything
that's really affecting me...

49
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,190
Oh, my...

50
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,536
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God. What am I gonna say?

51
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,320
What am I gonna say? What am I...

52
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,395
I sometimes worry

53
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,674
that I wouldn't be such
a feminist if I had bigger tits.

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,480
Well, it's good you felt something.

55
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,239
Is it?
- Something moved you.

56
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,936
I'm not sure I needed to be moved

57
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,160
to discover that about myself.

58
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,040
What were you thinking?

59
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,456
Well, I was thinking
about how peaceful I felt

60
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,536
and then, for some reason,
I was thinking about your tits

61
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,560
which kind of ruined it.

62
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,881
Oh, my tits ruined your peace?
- Yeah, you could say that.

63
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,040
I should probably...

64
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,056
...open the café actually, um...
- I've got a confession actually

65
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,456
actually in a little bit...
Oh, can I see it?

66
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,480
Uh...

67
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,910
Oh. Uh, yeah. It's a bit...

68
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,360
What?

69
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,631
It's a bit...
- What?

70
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,034
The fuck?

71
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,913
Wow.

72
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,720
Hello.

73
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,358
Oh, you gorgeous little thing.

74
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,639
Can I ask, um...

75
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,033
why so many guinea pigs?

76
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,831
Oh, um, I just, um...

77
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,436
This is an excellent one.

78
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,616
I just thought it'd be
a unique selling point.

79
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,640
Yeah.

80
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,555
Which came first, the guinea pig
or the guinea pig café?

81
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,314
That is a big old question.

82
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,720
Fair enough.

83
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,960
What do guinea pigs do?
- Um, they are born

84
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,736
they shit themselves with fear,
and then they die.

85
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,513
Can I use that at the wedding?

86
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,549
Seriously, I need material.

87
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,109
Tell me about your stepmother-to-be.

88
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,919
Any, uh... what's she like?

89
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,040
Oh, she's, um...

90
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,560
she's from Exeter.

91
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,156
Mm-hmm.

92
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,920
OK, thank you.
That's very helpful.

93
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,070
How did she meet your dad?

94
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,352
Through my mother.
- Right.

95
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,816
She was my mother's student
at one point.

96
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,376
Do your parents get on?

97
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,437
No. Were you close to your mum?

98
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,114
Yeah. You?

99
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,520
Not really.

100
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,976
How come?
- So that must've been a bit weird.

101
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,440
Well, I don't really think about it.

102
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,040
So you run... no, no.
- So do you go back a lot to...

103
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,231
Do you run this place
on your own?

104
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,680
No, I opened it with a friend.

105
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,320
Oh, cool, right.
So you run it together?

106
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,470
No, she's...

107
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,516
She, uh...

108
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,040
She what?

109
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,996
What?
- What?

110
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,760
She, she what?

111
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,120
She...

112
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,240
He's a bit annoying, actually.
- What is that?

113
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,520
What?

114
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,154
That thing that you're doing.

115
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,959
It's like you disappear.
- What?

116
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,713
What are you not telling me?
- Nothing.

117
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,496
Tell me what's going on underneath there.
- Nothing.

118
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,080
Tell me, come on. You can tell me.
- No.

119
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,800
Nothing. Nothing!
- Ah! What are you doing?

120
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,559
No, stop being so churchy.

121
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,376
I'm not being churchy,
I'm just trying to get to know you.

122
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,400
Well, I don't want that.

123
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,760
Listen, I'm just, I'm just,
I'm just trying to help you.

124
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,560
What?

125
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,319
No. No, I didn't mean...

126
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,536
Oh, I know what you mean, Father.

127
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,816
Thank you so much
for your guidance.

128
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,016
Come on, I didn't, I didn't mean...

129
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,136
Oh, look, I really should
get back to work.

130
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,760
A customer's bound
to turn up any minute.

131
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,216
And you should probably
be getting back to God

132
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,240
don't you think?

133
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,197
I think you've played
with my guinea pig long enough.

134
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,640
OK.

135
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,310
Alright, bye.

136
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,280
Sorry, girls,
people are starting to arrive.

137
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,917
She was a spectacular woman.

138
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,960
<i>Don't worry.</i>

139
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,110
We can sort this out.

140
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,679
Stop doing that to your face.

141
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,760
No, I have to.

142
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,036
I don't know what's wrong.
I just...

143
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,472
I look so good.

144
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,399
It's OK.
We can sort it out.

145
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,597
Just take
some of your makeup off.

146
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,760
I'm not wearing any makeup.

147
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,080
What?

148
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,200
What has happened?

149
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:13,536
I have never seen you...
- No, I don't know.

150
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,776
...look so good.
- I just woke up looking amazing

151
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,216
and then everyone's gonna think
I got a fucking facial

152
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,390
for my mother's funeral.

153
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,556
Oh, what the hell?

154
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,831
You look incredible.
- We're trying to mess her up.

155
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,496
Just no matter what I do
with my hair

156
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,115
it just keeps falling
in this really chic way.

157
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,195
Oh, God.

158
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,440
You look perfect.

159
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,040
Thank you.

160
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,191
Sorry, girls,
people are starting to arrive.

161
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,856
Thank you.
- You don't have to greet them if it's too...

162
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,439
Gosh, you look gorgeous.

163
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,360
Thank you.

164
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,920
I'm so sorry.
- Thank you.

165
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,073
You look glorious.
- Thank you.

166
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,112
Have you spoken to Dad?
- No, not yet.

167
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,320
He's avoiding me.

168
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,951
My deepest condolences, girls.

169
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,640
She was magnificent.

170
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,736
Thanks so much.
- Thank you so much.

171
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,035
My God, you look well.

172
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,396
Thank you. Have you?

173
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,474
No, he's not really engaging.

174
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,836
She was a spectacular woman.

175
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,920
Thanks.

176
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:03,070
Darling, you look wonderful.

177
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,600
Oh, my God.

178
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,920
- Hi, Claire.
- Hi.

179
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,960
Gosh, grief clearly agrees with you.

180
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,276
Thank you, Jeremy.

181
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,920
Oh, incoming.

182
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,836
How are you doing?

183
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,479
My God, she's shameless.

184
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,957
Can you not think
the fucking worst of someone

185
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,918
for just a split fucking second?

186
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,759
Not everyone is after cock.

187
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,919
She's definitely trying
to fuck my dad.

188
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,440
Well, she ain't made of wood.

189
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,630
Do you want a ciggy?

190
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,430
Oh, incoming.

191
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,275
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi, hi.

192
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,950
You OK?
- Mm-hmm.

193
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,351
You? Do you need anything?

194
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,115
Uh, no, I'm good, thanks.
I've just had a large glass of water.

195
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,560
Are your trousers OK?

196
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,549
I... sorry,
I-I left them in the dryer.

197
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,716
Oh, mate.

198
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,112
Oh, sh-shit. Sorry.

199
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,990
It's OK.

200
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,518
Funerals, when you actually knew
the person, they're so...

201
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,920
Oh.

202
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,073
It just doesn't feel real. I...

203
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,437
I'm just gonna miss her so much.

204
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,875
Have you, have you cried yet?

205
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,560
Yes.

206
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,035
Well, I didn't see you cr...

207
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,470
Wow, you look...

208
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,793
Have... have you had
your eyebrows done?

209
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,640
Hi, girls. How are you doing?

210
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,630
Alright.
- I'm good, thanks.

211
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,200
You know,
the hard bit's gonna come

212
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,158
in a few weeks,
when it all calms down.

213
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,951
Yeah, I have heard.
- They do say that, yeah, yeah.

214
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,360
When people start to forget

215
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,760
and the cards and the flowers
stop turning up.

216
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,279
Yeah.
- Uh-huh, yeah.

217
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,280
And people just disappear

218
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,000
because it spooks them
to be around someone

219
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,080
perpetually in pain.

220
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,196
OK.
- Right.

221
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,176
And your lovely boyfriends
might not be able to cope.

222
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,016
Oh, well, he's my husband, so...
- I'm sure they'll push through.

223
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,896
But I just want you to know
that I will always be there for you

224
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,920
always.

225
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,119
Always.
- Thank you.

226
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,430
Always.

227
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,630
Always.

228
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,634
I'm gonna check
on the sausage rolls.

229
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,635
OK.

230
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,390
See?

231
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,799
- OK.
- Yeah.

232
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,471
Hey.
- I don't know how you're eating.

233
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,749
Do something.

234
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,760
Hi.

235
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,712
Oh. Hello, darling.

236
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,319
- Bit tight.
- Oh, yeah.

237
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,194
Tell me about it.

238
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,392
I found her very difficult,
you know?

239
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,040
I know.

240
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,918
I... I loved her, but, um...

241
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,790
That's all that really matters.
- No, I don't think it is.

242
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,120
Her instincts were, you know

243
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,354
she... she just knew how to be fun.

244
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,356
How to be kind.

245
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,036
She just knew.

246
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,360
I'm just guessing.

247
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,280
You're fun, Dad.

248
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,670
No, I didn't like that about her, you see.

249
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,394
I loved her, but I didn't like
that she was...

250
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,473
For a long time, I...

251
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,160
And today...

252
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,554
I was jealous of her.

253
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,996
Uh-huh.

254
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,193
That is a lovely thing to say, really.

255
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,036
Oh, sorry.

256
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,074
I'll leave you two.

257
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,880
She's a bit annoying, isn't she?

258
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,115
Mm.
- Hmm.

259
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,399
Look, let's go and find your sister.

260
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,791
No, I don't think she wants to see me.
- Yeah, she loves you.

261
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,356
She just didn't get the fun gene.

262
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,876
Yeah.

263
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,915
I just...

264
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,874
I don't know what to do.
- I know.

265
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,916
I know.

266
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,520
Buck up.

267
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,397
Smile. Charm.

268
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,996
Off we go.

269
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,350
We'll be OK.

270
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,756
I'll follow you.

271
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,474
You look lovely, by the way.

272
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,280
Thank you.

273
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,120
<i>I don't know what to do with it.</i>

274
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,520
<i>With what?</i>

275
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,640
With all the love I have for her.

276
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,640
I don't know where to...

277
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,189
put it now.

278
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,200
I'll take it.

279
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,795
No, I'm serious. It sounds lovely.

280
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,036
I'll have it.

281
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,995
You have to give it to me.

282
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,394
OK.

283
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,440
It's got to go somewhere.

284

Whoa, why are you awake?

299
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,199
It's 9:45.
- Oh, my God.

300
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,856
I thought you were just
in my head then.

301
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,792
But, I mean,
you were in my head then.

302
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,192
But now you're there.

303
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,236
Are you OK, Father?

304
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,000
Oh, fuck you calling me Father

305
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,157
like it doesn't turn you on
just to say it.

306
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,640
Do you want a drink?

307
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,520
OK.

308
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,040
Don't move.

309
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,280
Are you a nostalgic person?

310
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,200
Yeah.

311
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,390
Do you like Winnie the Pooh?

312
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,519
Yeah.

313
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,874
I-I fucking love Winnie the Pooh.

314
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,871
I can't read a Winnie the Pooh quote
without crying.

315
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,840
Fuck.

316
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,240
Piglet.

317
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,400
Piglet.

318
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,160
Why are you here?

319
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,436
Sorry, but, I mean,
why-why are you...

320
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,714
Were you looking for me?

321
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,760
I was on the verge
of having a little prayer actually.

322
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,639
No.

323
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,116
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, don't...

324
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,233
Don't you dare. That's my thing.

325
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,720
What were you praying about?

326
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,256
Please say you were praying for me.

327
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,776
I could do with the extra pair of hands.

328
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,714
Mine don't seem to have
the fucking reach anymore.

329
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,760
God help me.

330
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,876
Whoa!

331
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,480
Thank you.

332
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,656
Do you know there was a man
who wanted to be a saint so badly

333
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,831
he castrated himself
just to stop himself...

334
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,517
you know... whack!

335
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,440
Wow.

336
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,630
Here's to peace.

337
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,193
And those who get
in the way of it.

338
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,469
I'm sorry about today.

339
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,560
Forget it.

340
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,280
Look at this.

341
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,600
Look at it.

342
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,919
That's the first one I ever got.

343
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,079
Went all the way to Rome for that.

344
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,673
Such a nerd.

345
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,230
Two years before I was even
allowed to wear it

346
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,516
but I just... I couldn't wait.

347
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,989
I couldn't wait.

348
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,280
I knew I wanted a bold,
you know, this colour

349
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,160
but proper plum.

350
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,118
You can only get proper plum in Italy.

351
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,676
Sometimes I worry
I'm only in it for the outfits.

352
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,195
So beautiful, isn't it?

353
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,680
I mean, your stuff is lovely, too.

354
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,149
Hmm.

355
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,149
What were you praying about?

356
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,116
You don't like
answering questions, do you?

357
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,600
OK.

358
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,720
Come with me.

359
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,189
I know what to do with you.

360
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,315
You go in there, I go in there.

361
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,039
And you make me tell you
all my secrets

362
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,873
so you can ultimately trap
and control me?

363
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,040
Yeah.

364
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,591
No. You tell me
what's weighing on your heart

365
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,070
and I listen without judgment
and in complete confidence.

366
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,231
- Sounds dodgy.
- I just listen.

367
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,240
At the very least,
it'll shut me up for a minute.

368
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,597
I'm not Catholic.
- Tonight, that doesn't matter.

369
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,120
Won't I catch fire or something?

370
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,440
If you did, it would confirm
my faith, so let's try it.

371
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,516
Go on.

372
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,440
Go on.

373
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,720
Alright.

374
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,710
OK, now you say

375
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,096
"Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned..."

376
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,096
- I'm not gonna say that.
- What? Very good.

377
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,760
"It's been..."
uh, enter days, years, months

378
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,360
"...since my last confession."
- Mm-mm.

379
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,711
Then I say, "That's OK,"
blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah

380
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,256
till you tell me what's on your mind.

381
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,112
Tell me your s...

382
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,430
Sins.

383
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,835
Sins. If you want.

384
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,079
Why would I tell you my sins?
- Because it will make you feel better.

385
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,509
And because...

386
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,995
I want to know!

387
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,960
OK.

388
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,990
I lied.

389
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,716
OK.

390
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,520
To you.

391
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,796
About?

392
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,957
About the miscarriage.

393
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,216
I was just covering for my sister,
who actually had the miscarriage

394
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,760
because her husband didn't know
she was pregnant, and it just...

395
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,876
OK.

396
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,910
Keep going.

397
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,434
Well, I've stolen things.

398
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,516
I've had a lot of sex
outside of marriage.

399
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,755
And once or twice
inside someone else's.

400
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,877
Uh, there's been a spot of sodomy.

401
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,719
Then, much masturbation

402
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,435
a bit of violence, and of course
the endless fucking blasphemy.

403
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,916
And?

404
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,480
And...

405
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,280
Go on.

406
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,796
And...

407
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,316
I...

408
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,920
I can't.

409
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,030
It's OK. Go on.

410
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,956
Frightened.

411
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,710
Of what?

412
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,155
Forgetting things.

413
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,950
People.

414
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,156
Forgetting people.

415
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,395
And I'm ashamed of not knowing

416
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,199
what I...
- What you want?

417
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,456
It's OK not to know what you want.

418
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,480
No, I know what I want.

419
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,796
I know exactly what I want, right now.

420
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,600
What's that?

421
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,796
It's bad.

422
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,076
It's OK.

423
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,560
I want someone to tell me
what to wear in the morning.

424
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,576
OK, well, I think
there are people who can...

425
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,160
No, I want someone to tell me
what to wear every morning.

426
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,038
I want someone to tell me
what to eat.

427
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,114
What to like, what to hate,
what to rage about.

428
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,752
What to listen to, what band to like.

429
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,759
What to buy tickets for.

430
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,832
What to joke about,
what not to joke about.

431
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,877
I want someone to tell me
what to believe in.

432
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,995
Who to vote for and who to love
and how to...

433
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,120
tell them.

434
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,560
I just think I want someone
to tell me...

435
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,176
how to live my life, Father, because so far

436
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,600
I think I've been getting it wrong.

437
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,080
But I know that's why people
want people like you in their lives

438
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,432
because you just tell them how to do it.

439
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,031
You just tell them what to do

440
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,056
and what they'll get out of the end of it

441
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,799
even though I don't believe
your bullshit.

442
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,076
And I know that scientifically
nothing that I do

443
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,576
makes any difference in the end anyway.

444
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,954
I'm still scared.

445
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,753
Why am I still scared?

446
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,634
So just tell me what to do.

447
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,835
Just fucking tell me what to do, Father.

448
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,200
Kneel.

449
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,680
What?

450
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,670
Kneel.

451
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,316
Just kneel.
