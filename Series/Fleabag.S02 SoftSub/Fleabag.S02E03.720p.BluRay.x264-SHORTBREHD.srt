1
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,313
Just don't... talk too much

2
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,416
or try to pretend you know anything
about the company.

3
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,750
OK.
- And don't be funny or clever or...

4
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,456
Just don't be the centre of attention.

5
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,856
These people are very important to me

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,155
so just don't...
- OK.

7
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,714
...don't be yourself.

8
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,190
I won't.

9
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,276
Fuck's sake.

10
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,638
I know people in this building.

11
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,680
Anyone could come...

12
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,640
Hi, Claire.

13
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,760
Hello, Leslie.

14
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,794
Ooh, that's lovely.

15
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,235
What is that?

16
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,279
We have a load of vegetarians

17
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,216
so make sure it's clear
which ones have meat in them.

18
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,496
Loves a crisis.
- We have a couple

19
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,576
of waitresses for the drinks

20
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,056
so if you could hand round the food.
- Mm-hmm.

21
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,376
Put her in a quiet room
with a nice breeze

22
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,176
she'll have a panic attack.
- Where is everyone?

23
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,200
She's so happy.

24
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,874
God, this is stressful.

25
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,560
Don't be weird
about how big my office is.

26
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,834
What the fuck?

27
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,355
- I know.
- Are you a...

28
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,756
It's over the top. I know. OK.

29
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,553
Put them on the table.
Not that table.

30
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,275
Oh. You OK?
- Of course. It's just

31
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,510
it's just, it's a big night

32
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,760
and the Finnish partners are here,
so it's all a bit...

33
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,551
- Oh, check the award.
- Why?

34
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,216
Just to make sure it's not pink
or anything horrifically female.

35
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,240
She'll loathe that.

36
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,078
Be careful with it.
It's worth thousands.

37
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,760
It's not pink.
- Good.

38
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,480
It's perfect.
It looks like a sperm.

39
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,000
Your hair looks nice.
- Shut up.

40
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,393
OK, don't sit on that.

41
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,034
OK, put those on the posh plates.

42
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,640
Put the award
behind the microphone.

43
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,910
Oh, and, um...

44
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,880
Thank you.

45
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,316
You've really, uh...

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Thank you.

47
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,513
Don't play with that.

48
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,675
Oh, that's heavy. Argh!

49
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,355
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

50
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,830
My God.

51
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,113
Where have you been?
- Oh, sorry.

52
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,696
I just had to get the vegetarian bites.
But it's all fine.

53
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,916
You're gonna love them.
- You're sweating so much.

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,559
Sorry.
- It's attention-grabbing.

55
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,757
It's only on one side.

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,515
Um, sorry, this is, uh, Sylvia.

57
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,256
She's going to be
presenting the award

58
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,715
so when you hear me
introduce her, get her onstage.

59
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,678
Hi.
- Has this got shellfish in it?

60
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,439
No.
- Fine.

61
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,520
Four CEOs have been fired.
Two are being taken to court.

62
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,755
I mean, it's just sad.

63
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,195
We felt like a family.

64
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,576
Yeah. Especially sad
when you have to tell your family

65
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,592
not to touch each other up
by the photocopier.

66
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,353
Stop making jokes.

67
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,880
I'm sorry. I can't help it.
- You can.

68
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,711
Oh, Belinda's coming.
Don't speak to Belinda.

69
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,920
Hello, Claire.
- Hello, Belinda.

70
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,839
God, you're tasteful.
- Mm.

71
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,310
Ooh, are these meaty?

72
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,109
Say something.

73
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,336
Um, no,
I think they have courgette in them.

74
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,874
Oh, I love courgette.

75
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,279
You can treat them appallingly
and they still grow.

76
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,598
She seems lovely.
- Yeah, she's great.

77
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,760
So who are you so nervous about?

78
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,156
I'm not nervous.
I'm being completely...

79
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,793
Claire!
- Oh!

80
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,435
Hi. Oh!
- Oh, wow.

81
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,080
Oh, sorry. I-I'm-I'm so glad
you could come.

82
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,879
- Of course. It's my job.
- Ah.

83
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,718
This is my catering.
She's the sister.

84
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,955
Hi.
- Ah.

85
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,396
I ate a sausage over there,
thinking it was a prune.

86
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,440
Oh.

87
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,278
Fifteen years of vegetarianism, gone.

88
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,356
Like bang, bang.

89
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,470
Oh.

90
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,896
We do actually call them "bangers."

91
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,673
Ah! That's funny!

92
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,950
Yes, it was.

93
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,920
So, how do you two know each other?

94
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,873
Uh, we're partners.
- Uh, we are partners.

95
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,096
Um, business partners in, um...
- Yes. She's been working with me

96
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,600
- in Finland, and, uh...
- Yes.

97
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,720
We don't get to see each other

98
00:04:49,721 --> 00:04:51,120
that much, but I'm...
- No, exactly.

99
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,480
I'm a huge...
- I'm a big fan.

100
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,552
Thank you. Admirer.

101
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,716
I'm going to get a drink.
Do you want anything?

102
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,678
Oh. Uh, champagne, please.

103
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,296
Oh, off the wagon?

104
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,515
Oh, just when I'm with you.

105
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,273
Let's go fucking crazy tonight, then.

106
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,914
Hmm?

107
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,720
What did you say?

108
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,793
No, no. I, um, I was...

109
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,439
No, what did you say?
- Oh, just, uh

110
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,760
uh...

111
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,872
I just said,
"Let's go fuck like crazy tonight."

112
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,400
Oh, God. Uh...

113
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,996
OK!

114
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,800
Shut up.

115
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,240
Oh, my God.

116
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,119
He is a very good businessman.
He's just socially sort of...

117
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,714
And what's, um...
- Shut up.

118
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,077
Claire.
- Please don't. Please don't.

119
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,039
I can't cope. OK?

120
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,076
OK.

121
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,120
What's his name?

122
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,360
What's his name?

123
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,960
Klare.

124
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,320
What?

125
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,675
His name is Klare.

126
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,314
Don't.
- Mm.

127
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,552
Oh, God, I have to announce.
OK, mingle.

128
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,995
But don't talk to anyone.
- OK.

129
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,355
I'm not in love with him.

130
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,680
OK.

131
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,553
Hi, everyone.

132
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,155
I am very proud
to announce the nominees

133
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,152
for the Women in Business Awards

134
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,160
sponsored by us here at Hurbots.

135
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,393
Amongst our exceptional women

136
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,751
we have Georgina Franks.

137
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,235
Belinda Friers.

138
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,596
And another extraordinary woman

139
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,475
Klare Korhonen.

140
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,309
Oh, uh, sorry. I-I think
there's been a mistake here.

141
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,472
I... and, uh, Elizabeth Sawkin.

142
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,030
Congratulations to you all.
Have a wonderful evening.

143
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,271
We will be presenting the award
very soon.

144
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,030
I'm gonna introduce Sylvia

145
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,176
who's gonna introduce Belinda.
- Uh-huh.

146
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,056
When you hear me introducing
Sylvia, get her onstage.

147
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,799
It has to go like "cockwork."
- Like what?

148
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,640
"Cockwork."

149
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,056
Claire, your brain
is somewhere else right now.

150
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,639
Just... Sylvia. Go.

151
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,950
Sylvia.

152
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,155
Crap.

153
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,599
A huge thanks to Matthew,
Mark Luke and John

154
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,955
for coming up with this award

155
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,431
and to Linkedln for connecting
us all this evening and beyond.

156
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,118
I am so excited
to introduce Sylvia Hamber

157
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,311
this year's winner
of Women Who Work...

158
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,520
...who will announce this year's

159
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,671
Best Woman in Business. Sylvia.

160
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,800
What an entrance!

161
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,720
I'll do it.

162
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,516
I can do it.

163
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,476
Um, I'm sorry.

164
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,671
It appears that Sylvia is busy

165
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,434
which shouldn't come
as a surprise, really.

166
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,280
Uh...

167
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,080
It's-it's been a big year
for business.

168
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,799
Particularly women in business.

169
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,874
Men have been pretty hands-on
the past few decades.

170
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,639
I'd like to thank
all the brilliant men and women

171
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,553
for supporting each other
here at Hurbots.

172
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,472
We're a... a family, really.

173
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,696
And if we've learned anything
during the past 12 months

174
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,951
it's that family really
shouldn't touch each other up

175
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,040
next to the photocopier.

176
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,076
Funny!

177
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,550
I am honoured to present this award

178
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,872
to this year's
Best Woman in Business...

179
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,675
Belinda Friers.

180
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,520
Fuck's sake!

181
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,832
Thank you, thank... thank you.

182
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,320
Well, um...

183
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,496
Well, I was going to say this is a bit
on the nose

184
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,751
but she doesn't seem to have one.

185
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,759
What were you thinking?
- It'll be fine.

186
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,952
It's not fine. I awarded her
with a pair of tits.

187
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,120
Chase her down.

188
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,955
Chase her down?
- It's a stolen piece of art.

189
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,416
I will deal with the photographer.

190
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,760
- Claire!
- Oh!

191
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,792
Oh, my God, you were brilliant.

192
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,036
Thank you, Klare.
- I loved the joke.

193
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,511
Ah.
- Oh, well, I didn't think it was that funny.

194
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,280
Can you go, my love?

195
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,993
Oh, I'm just gonna...
- Take the stairs.

196
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,794
OK.

197
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,994
I'm trained in martial arts.

198
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,720
It's just the basics, but it is enough.

199
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,240
I work at Harbots.

200
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,520
Hurbots.

201
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,832
Yes, I ate a courgette off your tray.

202
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,550
Yeah.
- It was delicious.

203
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,239
Thank you.
- What do you want?

204
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,600
That.

205
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,196
I-I need to take your award back.

206
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,832
Why?
- It's a stolen piece of art.

207
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,240
It's not really an award.
It's all my fault. I can explain.

208
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,750
Is it a long story?

209
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,720
Sort of.

210
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,520
And she still doesn't
know you have it?

211
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,910
That's glorious.

212
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,840
I think you did exactly the right thing.

213
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,992
I think you're the only person
who thinks that.

214
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,831
God. Women's awards.

215
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Congratulations.

216
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,231
Oh, it's infantilising bollocks.

217
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,993
Well, don't you think it's good that...

218
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,912
No. No. It's ghettoising.

219
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,872
It's a subsection of success.

220
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,470
Ah, it's the fucking
children's table of awards.

221
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,836
Why did you go?

222
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,153
Because I'd be an arsehole not to.

223
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,320
Ms Friers.

224
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,600
Thank you, darling.

225
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,240
Gosh, she's hot.

226
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,600
Yeah.

227
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,320
Are you a lesbian?

228
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,199
Not strictly. You?
- Mm.

229
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,160
Mm. Do you like old films?
- Some.

230
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,153
And what's your favourite period film?

231
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,840
Carrie.

232
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,995
God.

233
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,513
God, you are a tonic.

234
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,238
What do you do?
Are you a "woman in business"?

235
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,760
I run a café.
- Oh.

236
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,400
Oh, good for you.

237
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,955
Did you make the canapés?

238
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,790
Uh, no, actually, I stole them.

239
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,440
How old are you?

240
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,233
Fifty-eight, and you?
- Thirty-three.

241
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,875
Oh. Well, don't worry.
It does get better.

242
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,471
You promise?
- I promise.

243
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,352
Listen, I was in an aeroplane
the other day

244
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,075
and I realised... well, I-I mean

245
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,072
I've been longing to say this
out loud, so...

246
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,474
Women are born with pain built in.

247
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,920
It's our physical destiny.

248
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:03,120
Uh, period pains, sore boobs,
childbirth, you know.

249
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,672
We carry it within ourselves
throughout our lives.

250
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,160
Men don't.

251
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,715
They have to seek it out.

252
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,911
They invent all these gods
and demons and things

253
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,719
all so they can feel guilty
about things

254
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,520
which is something we do
very well on our own.

255
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,917
And then they create wars
so they can

256
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,999
feel things and touch each other

257
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,096
and when there aren't any wars,
they can play rugby.

258
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,830
And we have it all going on
in here, inside.

259
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,750
We have pain on a cycle
for years and years and years.

260
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:36,551
And then, just when you feel you
are making peace with it all, what happens?

261
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,480
The menopause comes.

262
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,638
The fucking menopause comes,
and it is...

263
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,553
...the most

264
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,759
wonderful fucking thing in the world.

265
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,958
And yes, your entire pelvic floor crumbles

266
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,470
and you get fucking hot,
and n-no one cares

267
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,800
but then...

268
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,640
you're free.

269
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,400
No longer a slave

270
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,319
no longer a-a machine with parts.

271
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,958
You're just a person, in business.

272
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,200
Oh.

273
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,755
I was told it was horrendous.

274
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,673
It is horrendous,
but then it's magnificent.

275
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,840
Something to look forward to.

276
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,720
You better get back
to that party.

277
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,998
Your party.
- Mm. It is not a party

278
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,795
until someone flirts with you.

279
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,600
And that's the only really
shit thing about getting older

280
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,036
is that people don't flirt
with you anymore.

281
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,352
Not really. Not with danger.

282
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,035
I miss walking into a room
and not knowing

283
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,392
and there's a sort of energy,
a dare.

284
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,871
And do not take that for granted.

285
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,191
There is nothing more exciting
than a room full of people.

286
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,400
Yeah, except most people are...

287
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,120
What?

288
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,240
Shit.

289
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,520
Oh.

290
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,280
Look at me.

291
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,350
Listen.

292
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,234
People are all we've got.

293
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,237
People are all we've got,
so grab the night by its nipples

294
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,039
and go and flirt with someone.

295
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,155
Mm. No, that's not what I meant.

296
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,990
Mm...

297
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,959
Oh. I wish you were my type.

298
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,910
You take this tart back to my party

299
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,856
and go and find someone
to actually do that with.

300
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,439
I want to do it with you.
- No.

301
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,920
Why not?

302
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,076
Honestly?
- Yeah.

303
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,910
I can't be arsed, darling.

304
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,510
I'm gonna go back to my room
and have one more martini

305
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,880
and if you need anything

306
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,439
call me.

307
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,440
Anything.

308
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,715
You can have whoever you want
at your age.

309
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,200
Except the Best Woman in Business.

310
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,313
Well, that's just cos she's... exhausted.

311
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,709
33 isn't exactly...

312
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,871
And what had Jesus done by 33?

313
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,119
Died?

314
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,271
Exactly. So get out there and flirt.

315
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,760
Here you are.

316
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,031
Oh, hi.
- Thought you might be snogging Finland.

317
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,639
Ha. No, I, uh...

318
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,154
Just, uh, sorting a few things.

319
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,840
I got her.
- Oh.

320
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,039
And Belinda gave me her card.
- Oh, that's great.

321
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,675
What?
- Nothing.

322
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,560
She's furious.

323
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,520
Really?
- Yes.

324
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,790
It was a great night.

325
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,639
Everything went smoothly
in the end

326
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,677
and everyone loved the canapés.

327
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,956
Really?
I'm a dead woman.

328
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,639
Really?
- Yes.

329
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,200
Really?

330
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,879
Yes. It was a great night.

331
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,880
She's gonna blow.
I just have a feeling...

332
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,758
I would have come up
with my own joke

333
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,473
if you hadn't put that one
in my head.

334
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,712
I have my own jokes.

335
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,156
I am funny, I am interesting.

336
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,392
I knew I shouldn't have
brought you here.

337
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,136
What do you mean "interesting"?
- You just think you can do

338
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,391
whatever you like,
say whatever you like

339
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,831
steal whatever you like,
kiss whoever you like.

340
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,877
He kissed me!
- Oh, I know!

341
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,956
You know?

342
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,336
Then why have we been spending the entire...
- Because you're fine.

343
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,000
You'll always be fine,
you'll always be interesting

344
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,800
with your quirky café
and your dead best friend.

345
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,998
You just make me feel
like I've failed.

346
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,359
Claire...

347
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,239
If you mention the size
of my office, I will scream.

348
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,756
It's huge.

349
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,234
I just thought
we were hanging out.

350
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,836
Just as friends.

351
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,476
We're not friends.

352
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,235
We are sisters.

353
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,956
Get your own friends.

354
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,193
Oh, hi.
- Oh, sorry.

355
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,936
I didn't have your number,
and you just said

356
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,280
come round anytime with G&Ts.

357
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,399
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.
I just, uh...

358
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,936
This is a bit embarrassing,
but recently I've been

359
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,475
really enjoying
going to bed at 9:30.

360
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,200
Oh, shit.
- No, it's fine.

361
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,789
I can see G&T...
Are you OK?

362
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,640
Yeah, yeah, I just-just fancied
a drink and a priest

363
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,836
and a chat, maybe.

364
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,350
Oh, that's my whole job.

365
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,136
We'll have to be quiet though

366
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,160
because Pam's a bit of a

367
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,471
sound tyrant in the evenings.

368
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,600
Pam lives here?

369
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,074
Yeah, Pam lives here.

370
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,031
- So, I read your book.
- OK, great.

371
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,680
Well, it's got some great twists.
- True.

372
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,439
Uh, but I just, I couldn't help

373
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,576
but notice...
- Come on, just spit it out.

374
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,637
...just one or two
little inconsistencies.

375
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,880
OK, sure.

376
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,878
So, the world was made
in seven days

377
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,073
and on the first day,
light came

378
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,720
and then, a few days later,
the sun came.

379
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,636
Yeah, that's ridiculous.

380
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,439
But you believe that.

381
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,593
But it's not fact.
It's poetry, it's moral code.

382
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,479
It's for interpretation
to help us work out

383
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,875
God's plan for us.

384
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,916
What's God's plan for you?

385
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,160
I believe God meant for me
to love people

386
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,433
in a... different way.

387
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,910
I believe I'm supposed
to love people as a father.

388
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,960
We can arrange that.

389
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,078
A father of many.

390
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,080
I'll go up to three.
- It's not gonna happen.

391
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,634
Two, then.
- OK, two.

392
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,474
Oh, shit, Pam.
She's not happy.

393
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,074
We should go outside.

394
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,256
Do you think I should become a Catholic?

395
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,350
No, don't do that.

396
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,870
I like that you believe
in a meaningless existence.

397
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,237
And you're good for me, you make me

398
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,670
question my faith.

399
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,312
And?
- I've never felt closer to God.

400
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,279
Fuck you.

401
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,800
What was that?

402
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,736
It wasn't a fox, was it?
- I don't know.

403
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,877
Was it a fox?
Shine something. Boo! Baa!

404
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,000
- Oh, God, I bet it's a fox.
- Oh, God.

405
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,549
No, I'm not being funny,
foxes have been after me for years.

406
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,240
It's like they have a pact or something.

407
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,596
I'm not kidding. I was on a toilet

408
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,672
a toilet of a train,
and when the train stopped

409
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,256
a fucking fox tried
to get through the window.

410
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,556
Of a train!
Its face was in the window.

411
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,911
And once,
when I was at a monastery

412
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,536
I woke up just feeling a bit weird

413
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,870
like there might be a fox about,
and a fox was sitting

414
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,429
underneath my window,
looking at me like this.

415
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,600
Pointing at me like,
"You... we're watching you.

416
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,800
We're having you."

417
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,830
Lucky God got there first.

418
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,157
Well, yeah.
- You could be a fox boy by now.

419
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,280
And we all know what happened to them.

420
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,875
You OK?
- I'm OK.

421
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,356
Do you think I'm mad?

422
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,760
Because of the fox thing
or cos of the God thing?

423
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,713
You're obsessed.

424
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,800
Do you ever have doubts?

425
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,554
Yes, of course. Every day.
It's part of the deal.

426
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,160
I just don't think
I could do it.

427
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,480
Especially as a...

428
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,720
What?

429
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,469
Celibacy and...

430
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,560
Oh, it's a fucking fox!

431
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,790
Chill out about the fox.

432
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,759
Oh, sorry. I just don't know
what they want from me.

433
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,116
Sorry.

434
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,280
Celibacy.

435
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,640
Go.

436
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,040
I just...

437
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,273
I couldn't give up sex forever.

438
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,836
It's just too...

439
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,320
too...

440
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,880
Celibacy...

441
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,116
is a lot less complicated than...

442
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,360
romantic relationships.

443
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,714
What if you meet
someone you like?

444
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,033
I talk and drink and laugh
and give them Bibles

445
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,793
and hope they eventually
leave me alone.

446
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,480
What if you meet
someone you love?

447
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,350
We're not gonna have sex.

448
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,720
I know that's what you think
you want from me, but it's not.

449
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,031
It won't bring any good.

450
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,193
- Well, it might.
- It won't.

451
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,760
I've been there many times...

452
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,796
before I found this.

453
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,990
Many, many times.

454
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,790
How many times?

455
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,676
Many.

456
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,598
I'd really like to be your friend, though.

457
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,000
I'd like to be your friend, too.

458
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,680
We'll last a week.

459
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,600
What was that?

460
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,876
What?

461
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,159
Where'd you...
where'd you just go?

462
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,320
What?

463
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,191
You just... went somewhere.

464
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,120
There. There.

465
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,440
Where'd you just go?

466
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,640
Nowhere.

467
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,310
OK.
