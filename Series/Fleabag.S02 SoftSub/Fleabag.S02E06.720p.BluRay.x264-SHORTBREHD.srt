1
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,480
What?

2
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,634
Mm.

3
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,716
What do you think?

4
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,800
I just...

5
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,152
Go on.

6
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,755
I just...
- Go on.

7
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,840
I...

8
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,833
I just can't believe you did that.

9
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,396
I know.

10
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,191
So good to see you.
- We're over the moon.

11
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,437
Hey, good to see you.
- Love the shirt.

12
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,400
Who is that?

13
00:01:10,401 --> 00:01:12,357
Ooh, is this a, uh...
- Don't. Come on.

14
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,553
Ooh!

15
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,114
Thank you.

16
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,953
What's happened with the priest?

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,400
Oh, pretty.
- Hi. Oh.

18
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,720
Nothing.

19
00:01:20,721 --> 00:01:23,280
Oh, so good of you to come and get me.

20
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,113
Get you?
- Uh, see me.

21
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,840
Hi, Jake.
- Where's Claire?

22
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,920
Just there.

23
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,590
Your dad's just down there.

24
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,515
Nice skirts.

25
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,038
Do you need me to say
anything emotional about today?

26
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,200
No, no. We're good.
- I think we're alright, thanks.

27
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,040
Do you want tequila? I'm gonna get one.
- Hi. Nice to...

28
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,320
How was Klare?

29
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,760
Well, he's crazy about me

30
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,673
so that's a nightmare.
- Nightmare.

31
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,616
He's back to Finland today anyway,
which is good.

32
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,760
It's fine. It's totally fine.
- Sounds like it's fine.

33
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,840
It is.

34
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,639
It's gonna be a lovely day, isn't it?
- I'm afraid so.

35
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,352
This is my very interesting friend Daniel,
who's deaf.

36
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,392
I picked him up
at a student gallery opening.

37
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,715
Utterly fascinating.

38
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,679
Can't hear a thing but is a fabulous
physical communicator

39
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,870
through hands and lips.

40
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,269
Oh! Oh...

41
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,919
Oh, I love that.

42
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,350
And this is
my extraordinary friend Francine.

43
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,800
She's a lesbian.

44
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,470
And this is Asif,
my bisexual Syrian refugee friend

45
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,416
who you haven't actually met yet, darling.
- Hi.

46
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,999
And, Asif, this is, um...

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,276
Oh, my God. This is...

48
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,438
This is... God, how extraordinary.
I just... I always call you "darling."

49
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,631
This is the love of my life.

50
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,320
Hi.

51
00:02:41,321 --> 00:02:44,358
Is there somewhere I can put this?
- We said no presents!

52
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,914
Oh, you're such a sweetheart.

53
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,633
She's a natural rule breaker.

54
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,030
Not today.
- No.

55
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,789
Ah, well, I've been trying
to get rid of it for ages, so...

56
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,840
Oh.

57
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,960
Thank you.

58
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,513
I'm going to open it over a bin
so I've got somewhere to put the paper.

59
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,714
Um, come with me.

60
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,559
Uh, are you short on staff or what?

61
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,115
Do you need me, or...?
- No.

62
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,959
I just wondered if you had
a little show planned.

63
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,798
What?
- Well, you normally do.

64
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,995
And I wondered if there was anything
I might need to know about

65
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,040
that might happen later.

66
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,360
No.

67
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,760
Good.

68
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,712
Well, let me know
if you change your mind

69
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,470
because today is the most
important day of my life.

70
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,958
And I love your father very much.

71
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,990
And I imagine you'd rather have me
looking after him

72
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,191
in the years to come
than having to do it yourself.

73
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,753
So, no more miscarriages.

74
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,192
It's worth a lot, so...

75
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,040
Thank you.

76
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,431
I'll go and put her
straight back on her shelf.

77
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,576
D'you know, I often thought it strange
that of all my pieces

78
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,875
you chose to take her.

79
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,910
Why?
- She was based on your mother.

80
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,711
So nice to have her back in the house.

81
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,800
Oh.
- Oh, fuck!

82
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:34,096
Oh! God. Fuck, you're here.
- Oh, Jesus.

83
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,679
I thought you were a fox.

84
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,154
You're not.
- No. Are you...

85
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,914
I didn't know you were...
- No, no, I'm fine. Sorry. I...

86
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,816
No, I just didn't want to...
I'm practicing the homily.

87
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,399
How's it going?
- Not good. Not good.

88
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,476
I can't, I can't...

89
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,560
You look lovely.

90
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,513
Thank you. So do you.

91
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,590
Wait till you see me in the full... shebang.

92
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,871
You're gonna lose your fucking mind.

93
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,996
We just need to get through this bit,
and then we can...

94
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,200
We can...
- Yeah.

95
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,995
Better get changed.
- Yeah.

96
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,320
Good luck.

97
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,073
Oh, my God.
- What?

98
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,637
You have lipstick all...
- Oh, fucking hell.

99
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,296
That would not look good. Is it gone?

100
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,595
Where?

101
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,156
Oh, fucking hell.

102
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,314
I don't know, I don't know...

103
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,479
Oh, I don't know what this feeling is.

104
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,633
Is it God, or is it me?
- I don't know.

105
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,080
I don't know.

106
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,360
Fuck you, then.

107
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,551
Where's your priest?
- Oh. I don't know.

108
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,960
You OK?

109
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,872
Yes, well, um... I hate my husband

110
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,152
and the man I love is on his way to Finland,
so pretty weird.

111
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,314
Oh, way to upstage the bride!

112
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,720
Tried my best.

113
00:06:23,721 --> 00:06:25,598
Cute dress.

114
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,353
Oh, look!

115
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,199
Whoo!

116
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,920
This is our very chic priest.
- Oh, good, I was aiming for chic.

117
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,992
Particularly good around the, uh...
- Thank you.

118
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,074
Father, you remember Martin.

119
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,998
Hey, how you doing, man?
- Bit nervous, Martin.

120
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,633
Do you know Jake?

121
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,176
Yes, hello, Jake. How are you?
- Father.

122
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,477
And this is my very interesting friend Lucy,
who is a surrogate.

123
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,239
- Hello, Interesting Lucy.
- Weird.

124
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,279
And this is my unstable step-daughter

125
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,074
who's had a miscarriage.
- Nice to see you again.

126
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,118
You, too.
- But you knew that. You were there.

127
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,640
It was my miscarriage.

128
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,350
What?

129
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,995
It was my fucking miscarriage.

130
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,156
Yes, I thought you'd find that funny.

131
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,000
How interesting.
- She was just covering for me.

132
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,635
We were pregnant?
- For a few weeks, yes.

133
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,096
It was my baby?
- Sorry, so you haven't had a miscarriage?

134
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,120
No. Sorry.

135
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,080
Wait, what the fuck is going on here?
It-it was my baby?

136
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,520
I guess it was your baby's way of saying
it didn't want you as its father.

137
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,040
Like a goldfish out of the bowl
sort of thing.

138
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,955
Sorry, but whoever had a miscarriage

139
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,640
could you take it to the kitchen, please?

140
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,193
No. Don't follow me, Jake.

141
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,398
Oh, and this is over.

142
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,958
Ah!

143
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,280
Ooh.

144
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,160
You're leaving me.
- No, no, no.

145
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,998
Yes!
- Are you drunk?

146
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,395
Yes.
- Are you sober?

147
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,272
A bit. Could you just fuck off...

148
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,674
Oh, absolutely not.
- OK, no, no.

149
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,836
I'm staying right here.

150
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,520
I want you to leave me.
- Listen to me. I just, I have...

151
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,314
I think he has a little speech.
- I have a little speech

152
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,396
that's building here.

153
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,157
Now, I know you look at me and you see
a bad man with a big beard.

154
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,630
You are an alcoholic,
and you tried it on with my sister.

155
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,310
Fine. I tried to kiss your sister
on her birthday.

156
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,233
- My birthday!
- Fine!

157
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,239
I mix up birthdays,
and I have an alcohol problem

158
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,351
just like everyone else
in this fucking country!

159
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,240
But I am here, and I do things.

160
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,233
I pick up Jake from shit.

161
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,999
I make dessert for Easter.

162
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,759
I organise the downstairs toilet.

163
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,912
I fired the humming cleaner.

164
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,271
You enjoyed that.
- I hoover the car.

165
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,794
I put up all your certificates

166
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,674
and I don't make you feel guilty
for not having sex with me.

167
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,871
I am not a bad guy!

168
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,234
I just have a bad personality.
It's not my fault.

169
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,634
Some people are born
with fucked personalities.

170
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,920
Look at Jake.

171
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,914
He is so creepy. It's not his fault.

172
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,833
Why the bassoon?

173
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,360
You want to know what the bassoon is?

174
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,711
It's a cry for help!

175
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,510
The main fucking problem here
is that you don't like me.

176
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,871
And that has been breaking
my fucking heart for 11 years.

177
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,671
I love you. I make you laugh.

178
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,872
I'm a douche, but I make you laugh.

179
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,475
You said that that was
the most important thing!

180
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,513
I think the thing that you hate the most
about yourself

181
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,155
is that you actually love me.

182
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,279
So, I am not going to leave you

183
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,439
until you are down on your knees

184
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,270
and begging me.

185
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,630
Please leave me!

186
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,357
Oh, man.

187
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,118
I didn't think you'd do that in that dress.

188
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,314
Right. Well...

189
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,589
I guess the only thing left
for me to say is...

190
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,560
Fuck you.

191
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,640
Fuck you.

192
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,393
What have you done with him?
- Who?

193
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,480
Your father.

194
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,355
The wedding is about to start
and no one can find him anywhere.

195
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,400
Um...
- Can you do something?

196
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,553
Please. Please.

197
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
Please.

198
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,196
Garden.
- Upstairs.

199
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,240
OK.

200
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,920
Dad?

201
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,560
Dad.

202
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,560
I can't get out.

203
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,954
OK, Dad, you can.

204
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,400
I can't. It's a trap.

205
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,394
I'm stuck.
- No. Dad...

206
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,909
J-Just, there's nothing I can do.
- Everyone will understand.

207
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,880
Just give them all a bottle to take home.
Honestly, they will be relieved.

208
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,872
My foot... is stuck.

209
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,800
Oh.

210
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,954
"Everyone will understand"?

211
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,840
Um...

212
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,237
W-Will you help me, please?
- Oh.

213
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,272
How is it stuck?
- Just help me get it out.

214
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,993
I'm going to be in so much trouble.

215
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,952
What are you doing up here?
- I'm...

216
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,837
I just remembered that I had left a...
a friendly mousetrap

217
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,156
up here a few weeks ago,
and I hadn't checked it

218
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,078
and I just wanted to make sure

219
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,033
that one little chap
hadn't got, uh, trapped in it

220
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,436
and was, uh...
was suffocating up here.

221
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,760
Like...

222
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,639
Think I've worked out what we need to do.
- Well, let's do it.

223
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,640
Do it.

224
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,040
Darling.

225
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,560
I'll do it if you tell me
why you're up here.

226
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,554
Just one honest answer.

227
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,394
I... What? What, I...

228
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,640
I don't think...

229
00:13:06,641 --> 00:13:07,869
One full sentence.

230
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,154
I was checking on the mouse.

231
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,960
Dad.

232
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,656
Do you wanna make a run for it?

233
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,456
I can smuggle you out
in one of Mum's dresses.

234
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,392
You would, as well.

235
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,031
No, I-I know she's not...

236
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,160
everyone's cup of tea.

237
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,393
And neither are you, darling.

238
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,315
I mean, I'm sorry...

239
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:43,032
I love you, but I'm not sure
that I like you all the time.

240
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,880
Sorry.

241
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,680
Hey, you created this monster.

242
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,796
You're not the way you are because of me.

243
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,880
I know.

244
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,392
You're the way you are because of her.

245
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,638
And it's those bits
that you need to cling to.

246
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,672
Alright, can you get my shoe out?

247
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,196
I just want you all to be proud of me.

248
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,350
We are proud of you, Dad.

249
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,440
You have two daughters who love you,
even if you don't like them.

250
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,631
I like Claire.

251
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,718
Jesus, Dad!

252
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,518
Thank you.
- OK...

253
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,880
Come on.

254
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,833
I-I don't think I can go...

255
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,674
Come on. Buck up.

256
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,669
Smiles, charm. Off we go.

257
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,317
I think you know how to love
better than any of us.

258
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,715
That's why you find it all so painful.

259
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,475
I don't find it painful.

260
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,240
There, there, there.

261
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,638
OK, go, go, go.

262
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,880
OK, Dad.

263
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,714
No, don't. Stay with me.

264
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,240
Stay, stay.

265
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,160
Hi.

266
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,634
Darling.

267
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,680
Sorry.

268
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,240
Good afternoon, everybody.

269
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,678
Thank you for coming today
to celebrate the love between

270
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,719
these two very special people.

271
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:03,155
Before we start, uh, Jake has asked
to play another piece on his bassoon.

272
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,435
I can't do this reading.

273
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,836
Don't do it.
- What?

274
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,436
I'll do it.
You go and get him.

275
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,280
I can't go and get him.

276
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,557
Why not?
- It's too late.

277
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,592
I can't leave my father's wedding.

278
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,639
He's called "Klare" for God's sake

279
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,512
and he's already at the airport anyway.

280
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,720
Well, there you go.

281
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,320
Is it "running through the airport"
kind of love?

282
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,760
I'm not going to the airport.

283
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,473
He'd think I was insane.
- Yeah.

284
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,400
I'm just saying...
- The airport?

285
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,556
How would I even find him?

286
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,871
You can't get through security
without a boarding pass.

287
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,936
No, I wasn't suggesting that...
- I'd have to buy a dummy ticket

288
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,096
just to get through the gate.

289
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,430
I don't know when his flight is
or which terminal.

290
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,110
Imagine if I knew that.
Imagine him finding out I knew all that.

291
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,709
Imagine if he was just in Boots
buying a pair of tweezers

292
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,911
in Terminal Five,
and suddenly I was there.

293
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,110
"Hello, Klare."

294
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,640
Yeah. OK, that would be intense.

295
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,720
The only person
I'd run through an airport for is you.

296
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,920
Thank you, Jake,
for that beautiful bassoon piece

297
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,399
uh, written specially for today.

298
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,274
I believe it's called...

299
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,440
"Where's Claire?"

300
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,755
I think what you guys are doing is amazing.

301
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,240
Sorry...

302
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,520
Phew! Fuck me.

303
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,195
Sorry. Didn't get much sleep last night.

304
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:41,152
So, it turns out it's quite hard to come up
with something original to say about love

305
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,710
but I've had a go.

306
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,436
Love is awful.

307
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,917
It's awful.

308
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,680
It's painful.

309
00:17:57,681 --> 00:17:58,830
It's frightening.

310
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,595
It makes you doubt yourself, judge yourself.

311
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,360
Distance yourself
from the other people in your life.

312
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,470
It makes you selfish.

313
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,116
It makes you creepy!

314
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,039
It makes you obsessed with your hair.

315
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,069
It makes you cruel!

316
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,994
It makes you say and do things
you never thought you would do!

317
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,959
There's something wrong with your priest.

318
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,879
It's all any of us want,
and it's hell when we get there!

319
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,710
So no wonder it's something
we don't want to do on our own.

320
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,273
I was taught, if we're born with love

321
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,596
then life is about choosing
the right place to put it.

322
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,876
People talk about that a lot,
it feeling right.

323
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,274
"When it feels right, it's easy."

324
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,794
But I'm not sure that's true.

325
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,194
It takes strength to know what's right.

326
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,438
And love isn't something
that weak people do.

327
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,160
Being a romantic
takes a hell of a lot of hope.

328
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,875
I think what they mean is...

329
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,792
when you find somebody that you love...

330
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,550
it feels like hope.

331
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,830
Go out the side way.

332
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,440
Now.

333
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,032
So thank you for bringing us
all together here today.

334
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,119
To take words from this book of love...

335
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,354
"Be strong and take heart

336
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,792
all you who hope in the Lord."

337
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,149
Um, let's get on with the big bit.

338
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,191
Oh. There you are.

339
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,760
Hi.

340
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,960
Huh.

341
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,398
Ah...

342
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,160
Oh, uh...

343
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,672
Oh, fuck it.

344
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,960
Thank you.

345
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,120
Mm.

346
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,396
And thank you.

347
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,515
Oh, the, uh, priest is looking for you.

348
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,640
Oh.

349
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,672
Don't break his heart.

350
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,776
Oh, well, thank you so much...
- Hiya.

351
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,712
Oh, are you leaving?
- Oh, actually, well...

352
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,310
I thought you were...
- I was changing.

353
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,631
Oh, yeah.
- What do you do? Do you get the...

354
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,513
Get the bus, or...?
- Yeah, I get the bus.

355
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,273
On the road?
- Just on the road.

356
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,595
I get on the bus.
- Cool.

357
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,037
OK.
- Well, bye, my daughter.

358
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,359
Bye, Father.

359
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,949
Bye, Father.

360
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,400
"Bye, Father."

361
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,270
Goodbye.
- Bye.

362
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,873
You nailed it.

363
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,550
They always lie.
It'll magically come in a minute.

364
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,160
Yeah.

365
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,273
They're really into each other, those two.

366
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,840
It's nice.
- They really pulled it off.

367
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,680
Was your sister OK? She seemed...
- Yeah. She, um...

368
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,518
Bit on edge.
- She's run off to a work thing.

369
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,040
Wow. Dedicated.

370
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,759
Addicted.

371
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,595
It's God, isn't it?

372
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,840
Yeah.

373
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,552
Damn.

374
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,960
Damn.

375
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,719
You know, the worst thing is...

376
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,394
that I fucking love you.

377
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,520
I love you.

378
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,470
No, no, don't.

379
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,640
No, let's just leave that out there,
just for a second on its own.

380
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,320
I love you.

381
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,560
It'll pass.

382
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,600
This bus is not magically coming.
- I think I'll walk.

383
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,354
OK.

384
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,960
Uh, see you Sunday?

385
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,950
I'm joking, you're never ever allowed
in my church again.

386
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,080
I love you, too.

387
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,600
OK.

388
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,080
