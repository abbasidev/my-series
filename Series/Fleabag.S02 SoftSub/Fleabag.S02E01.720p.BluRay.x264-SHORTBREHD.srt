1
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,673
I opened a café with my friend Boo.

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,759
Yeah, she's dead now.

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,896
Thank you for coming in today...

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,230
That kind of thing won't get you
very far here anymore.

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,880
I suppose you should meet Hilary.

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,396
She's beautiful!

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,869
Mum died three years ago.

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,800
Loo, doo, ooh, badoo!

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,840
Alright, Dad?

10
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,236
Dad's way of coping
with two motherless daughters

11
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,936
was to buy us tickets to feminist lectures

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,160
start fucking our Godmother
and eventually stop calling.

13
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,040
Did you take the sculpture?
- What sculpture?

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,760
Martin's being lovely.

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,997
I am not drunk.
- Always drunk.

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,873
Jake's her step-son, he's really weird.

17
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,196
Probably clinically
but no one really talk about that.

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,319
No!

19
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,549
I go the Finland promotion.

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,034
That's amazing!
- Thank you.

21
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,280
People make mistakes.

22
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,154
Your husband tried to kiss me
on your birthday.

23
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,235
I've just got to say this once.

24
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,714
He didn't try to kiss you.

25
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,576
He says it was like more like
the other way around.

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,956
You have to believe me!
- How can I believe you?

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,480
Because I'm your sister.

28
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,000
After what you did to Boo?

29
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,878
I'm sorry.
- I think you should go.

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,198

No, thank you.

38
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,756
They've gone.

39
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,840

You know when you've done everything?

45
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,914
When you've been all...
- Squat!

46
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,394
Squat!
- Squat!

47
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,440
And...

48
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,360
You've even...

49
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,960
Do you wanna have sex?

50
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,560
No.

51
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,234
Can I at least go down on you?

52
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,480
No!

53
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,877
You've done everything

54
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,559
and you feel great.

55
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,679
You're not even thinking about...

56
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,389
You don't even think about...

57
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,600
And even though your sister
still hates you...

58
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,917
Thank you.
- You're pretending to be friends

59
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,960
because your dad is...

60
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,831
I'm joking, he's just there.
- Here's to love.

61
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,160
And engaged.

62
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,237
To love!
- To love.

63
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,953
Ayyy!

64
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Eugh.

65
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,078
Congratulations, you assholes.

66
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,237
So, uh, it means a great deal to both of us

67
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,079
that, uh you... that we...

68
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,431
the family, are... are... uh...

69
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,280
are all...

70
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,994
together here for, uh...

71
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,480
For a very special family...

72
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,990
gang bang.

73
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,311
It's just, you know, being here...

74
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,438
You know, I know we've had our...

75
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,110
Cos I-I...

76
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,232
I have the feeling, um...

77
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,840
in...

78
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,750
here.

79
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,833
Th-That... So, I just want to...

80
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,720
say...

81
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,280
Very much.

82
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,520
And that's it.

83
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,639
Oh, darling.

84
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,790
Aww!
- Congratulations, Dad!

85
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,354
Congratulations.
- Cheers.

86
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,039
May these be the worst of our days.

87
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,670
Don't know who this guy is.

88
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,235
Happy for you, old boy.
Best decision a man can make.

89
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,600
Ugh.

90
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,759
You look well.
- Thank you.

91
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,473
Right, wine, everyone?

92
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,976
We'd love some wine, please.
- Oh, you'll adore it, I chose it.

93
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,320
Not for us, thanks.

94
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,916
Off the sauce!
- Six months and counting.

95
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,031
Why would you do that?
- We just...

96
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,400
Don't wanna miss a thing.
- Enjoy each other more this way.

97
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,230
Haven't seen her since...

98
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,756
Except for...

99
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,399
Nice jumpsuit.
- Thank you.

100
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,960
You look well, where've you been?

101
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,160
Boots.

102
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,920
It's lovely there this time of year.

103
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,114
Oh, you look fantastic.

104
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,119
Oh, well, you both look gorgeous!
- Oh, thank you.

105
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,160
Is that fur?

106
00:04:44,161 --> 00:04:47,073
Yes, but it's OK because it had a stroke.

107
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,190
Oh, lovely!

108
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,391
I can't go to hell for that, can I, Father?
- No.

109
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,109
Not as long as you confess.
- Oh, God, he's their priest.

110
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,496
Then you've nothing
to fucking worry about!

111
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,795
Their cool, sweary priest.

112
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,991
Love the Catholics!
You can get away with anything.

113
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,315
A lot of them did!

114
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,070
It's an honour to be marrying you two.
Thank you.

115
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,919
I didn't realise you were allowed out
without your little doggy thing.

116
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,239
Oh, sorry, have I disappointed you?
- Of course not.

117
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,400
Devastated.

118
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,795
Can I get you another bottle?

119
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,599
Needy waitress.
- Ah, no, it's alright.

120
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,996
We've already ordered wine.
- Oh, no, really?

121
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,720
I'll have another tequila.

122
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,080
I'll have a tequila.

123
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,200
Great, thank you so much.

124
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,399
Can I get a glass of sparkling water
with a dash of lime, please?

125
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,558
Oh, yes, I'll have the same.

126
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,559
Dream team.

127
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,794
You know, the most fascinating thing
about Father here

128
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,197
is that his mother was originally a lesbi...

129
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,752
- Is everyone OK?
- You do look tired.

130
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,240
Oh, it's not as exhausting
as I thought it would be, actually.

131
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,875
She's commuting from Finland.

132
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,795
She has narrowed down her packing
to a ten-minute turnaround, it's...

133
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,514
It's fabulous!
- It's all about...

134
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,433
Rolling it up, rather than...
- Folding it.

135
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,800
I read about that.

136
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,230
Are you sure you don't want any wine?

137
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,430
No, thank you.

138
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,712
It really is delicious.
I admire you both so much.

139
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,736
Well, it's really turned us around,
hasn't it, honey?

140
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,194
Oh, so much more energy.

141
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,280
You know, in Finland...

142
00:06:11,281 --> 00:06:13,576
Is there a reason that you're not drinking?
- He's an alcoholic.

143
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,239
Oh, fun, my parents are alcoholics.

144
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,199
Oh, great.

145
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,112
We thought it'd be easier
if we did it together.

146
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,880
And I don't really like the taste.
- And we are trying for a baby.

147
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,550
Oh, Claire!
We thought you couldn't have them.

148
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,398
What, why?
- Well, you just seem a little...

149
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:31,190
Well, they say a lifestyle change can help,
so here we go.

150
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,436
That is so exciting, darling.

151
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,000
Oh, thanks, Dad.
- Good luck.

152
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,110
That's wonderful.

153
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,816
Something's up.
- And now you have the money

154
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,840
to pay for proper help.

155
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,998
Ghastly without help, I imagine.

156
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,876
Tell us about Finland.

157
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,475
Oh, well, it's, um...

158
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,156
Cold and beautiful and dark.

159
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,830
I think she might be happy.

160
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,519
It's a lot of pressure but I love it.

161
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,456
I have this amazing new partner out there,
he's really pushed the company forw...

162
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,696
D'you know, I can't remember
the last time we went away.

163
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,951
Weren't you both in Japan recently?

164
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,320
Japan, wow.

165
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,160
Oh, yes, but that was just
a little fortnight.

166
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,158
- Don't ask her.
- Why were you in Japan?

167
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,880
Well, the...
- I was... Oh, sorry, darling.

168
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,276
Oh, no, no. No.

169
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,640
Thank you. Erm...

170
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,956
They flew us over with the Sexhibition.

171
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,416
Yes, really made it...
- And... sorry, darling.

172
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,920
Do you want to...?
- No, no, no.

173
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,435
No? Oh. You see, you think of the Japanese

174
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,736
as a very prudish people...
- Well, we're not to generalise.

175
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,878
But actually they have a very deep
interest in sex in their culture.

176
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,776
It's just hidden in the underbelly,
it's not allowed to come to the surface.

177
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,536
- Fair enough.
- They really appreciate...

178
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,216
The honesty of the Sexhibition,
whereas the...

179
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,560
The Americans.
- The Americans...

180
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,856
Well, they just took me in their stride.

181
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,793
But the Japanese were deeply moved
by my work ethic

182
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,000
weren't they, darling?
- Yeah.

183
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,277
It caused quite a cultural wave.
- Ripple.

184
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,549
Rip... w-wave.

185
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,559
Wave.

186
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,195
No one's asked me a question in 45 minutes.
- So what do you do?

187
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,310
Er, I run a café.

188
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,035
Oh, wow!

189
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,510
It's going well, is it?

190
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,673
Yes, it is. It really is.

191
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It actually is.

192
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,640
It is.

193
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,433
Can I get anyone any ice?

194
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,520
Fellow smoker.

195
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,518
Do you have a spare one?
- Sure.

196
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,318
So, do your family get together much, or...?

197
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,200
Fuck you, then.

198
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,280
We should wait.

199
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,720
OK.

200
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,280
Mm.

201
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,760
He's such a lovely man.

202
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,439
Yes.

203
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,480
Did you have a cigarette?

204
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,352
Yeah.
- I just wish you could've seen him...

205
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,198
Yeah, they can't even masturbate.

206
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,038
- Shit alive, man.
- Oh, sorry.

207
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,680
- No, no.
- Hey!

208
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,276
We were just saying, it's fascinating,
the notion of a calling.

209
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,394
Yeah, well, marriage is a calling too,
of course.

210
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,035
Did you always want to join the priesthood?
- Oh, fuck, no.

211
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,073
Sorry.

212
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,079
No, no, no.

213
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,710
I came quite late to it, actually,
but it's been a really good life to me.

214
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,275
I've really found peace in it.

215
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,836
Is anyone in your family in the Church?
- Actually, both my parents are lawyers

216
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,720
and my brother
is a long-distance lorry driver.

217
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,351
How unusual! Are your parents successful?

218
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,797
They were very successful alcoholics, yeah.

219
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,118
Better than you, anyway.
- Ha-ha!

220
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,390
No, but beyond them

221
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,594
my family's literally crawling with nuns,
so it wasn't too much of a leap.

222
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,950
Must be hard on the balls.

223
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,600
Martin!

224
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,520
Not as hard on them as trying
to make a baby for five months, I imagine.

225
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,759
- Food good?
- This sauce is disgusting.

226
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,316
Is everything OK?
- Oh, it's delicious, thank you.

227
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,760
- Thank you.
- Lovely, lovely.

228
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,356
Um, darling?
- No, no.

229
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,517
We'll just pour our own wine, please.

230
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,797
Oh, I actually love doing...
- Thank you.

231
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,752
You can pour me some.
- Oh, thank you.

232
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,076
So, do you do a lot of older weddings?

233
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,474
I don't think that's how we...

234
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,716
No, this is my first ever wedding, actually.

235
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,989
Oh!

236
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,953
D'you know, I've always been so suspicious
of religion but I must say

237
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,438
I think there's something rather chic
about having a real priest at a wedding.

238
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,440
Are you a real priest?

239
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,040
Yeah.

240
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,555
D'you know, it's so nice spending time
getting to know the man

241
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,398
who's going to marry us.
- Is that usual?

242
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,119
No, but I'm new to the parish

243
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,799
and I guess I'm just...

244
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,031
I'm really fucking lonely!

245
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,520
So...

246
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,392
So I appreciate this.
Thank you very much.

247
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,510
New to the parish?

248
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:08,113
Father Patrick sadly died, so I got the gig.

249
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,110
What did he die of?
- Just, um, time.

250
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,840
Oh.

251
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,879
But he was a dedicated man,
he was a brilliant priest.

252
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,160
Sounds like a riot.

253
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,877
He was, actually.

254
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,880
Do you know how we met?

255
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,439
No.

256
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,440
Through Jake.

257
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,880
Creepy step-son.

258
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,952
- He plays the flute.
- The bassoon.

259
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,834
In the church band. Just adorable!

260
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,760
And Claire introduced us
and we just hit it off.

261
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,594
Didn't we?
- We did, yeah.

262
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,640
They did.

263
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,676
She's donating a painting for the fete,
it's gonna cause quite the stir.

264
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,313
Oh, it's just an old one, but...

265
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,914
Now, listen, um,
we don't want gifts at the wedding.

266
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,671
I mean, it's enough that people slog it over
without then expecting a gift.

267
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,680
So we've decided to ask people
to make a small donation

268
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,316
to a charity of their choosing, in our name.

269
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,640
That sounds lovely.

270
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,856
Do you want to know what gift
I'm giving your father?

271
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,394
Oh, God.
- It's a portrait.

272
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,353
Oh, God.
- Of you girls.

273
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,716
Oh, God. Erm...

274
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,832
Do you mean...?
- Together, or, erm...?

275
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,594
I'd only need a couple of sittings.

276
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,279
Right. Can't you use photos?

277
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,073
No, because the lighting's
never good enough

278
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,589
and if you're not very photogenic
then it does you no favours.

279
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,479
And besides, the only photos there are

280
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,557
of you two together
are of when you were children

281
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,120
and you looked like a boy, so...

282
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,194
You never told me you had a sister, Claire.
- Oh, well, we, um...

283
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,472
We don't get to see each other much.

284
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,277
Do you see your brother?

285
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,757
Oh, I don't really speak to my brother.
- Oh, God, how desperately sad!

286
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,800
Why is that?

287
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,719
Oh, erm, well...
- You don't have to...

288
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,679
No, no, it's OK.

289
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,496
Does he not approve of what you do,
of your choices?

290
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,776
No, it's not that, it's not that.
- Is he not in the Church?

291
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,235
No, he's not in the Church.
- Oh, it must be so hard!

292
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,256
Well, it's mainly hard...
- Is it cos he's Mummy's favourite?

293
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,555
Because he's a paedophile.

294
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,160
Oh.

295
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,120
I'm aware of the irony of that.

296
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,475
Just a... just a breath of air, eh?

297
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,549
Interesting man.

298
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,960
Mm.

299
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,960
No, thanks.

300
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,592
Darling, I, uh...
I'm sorry I missed your birthday

301
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,960
so I just...
- Oh, that's OK.

302
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,390
No, no. I just... In case you're struggling.

303
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,394
Oh, Dad, the café's going well.
- No, no, this is not for work.

304
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,120
It's just for you.

305
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,920
Thanks.

306
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,630
You look, er...

307
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,560
strong.

308
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,519
Thanks.
- Are you?

309
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,916
Are we gonna have a fight?
- No, no! I'm sorry, no.

310
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,034
I just want to check that that you're...
that you and I are...

311
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,312
Well, you're being very...

312
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,514
You're not being naughty.

313
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,350
No!
- Why?

314
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:23,117
Oh. Because, I guess...

315
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,280
Yeah?

316
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,560
It doesn't matter.

317
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,280
Oh.

318
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,359
OK.

319
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,360
Is that right?

320
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,836
I'm happy for you, Dad.

321
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,240
Thank you.

322
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,677
Ah! Thank you.

323
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,120
You're an exceptional waitress.

324
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,800
Apple juice?

325
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,040
Yeah.

326
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,317
I... I just wanted to say

327
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:14,831
I am so intrigued to see how you're going to
make this whole evening about yourself.

328
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,800
Oh, no.

329
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,231
We probably shouldn't arrive
at the table together.

330
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,638
A lot of people would say praying
is just talking to yourself in the dark.

331
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,320
I guess it could look like that, but...

332
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,157
No, it's more just about connecting
with yourself at the end of each day.

333
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,238
It takes a bit of effort, but...
- Yes, yes, I completely agree.

334
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,794
Positive energy takes work.
- Yes.

335
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,718
In the last six months, I've excelled.

336
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,194
I take all the negative emotions

337
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,560
and just bottle them and bury them
and they never come out.

338
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,680
I'm not sure...
- I've basically never been better.

339
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,275
Us neither.
- I feel fantastic!

340
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,816
- You're a very positive family, I must say.
- Oh, absolutely.

341
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,320
I think it's all about positivity.

342
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,192
It takes real commitment to be this happy.

343
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,550
It's not just about
eating and drinking well, either.

344
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,816
Putting pine nuts on your salad
doesn't make you a grown-up.

345
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,513
Fucking does.
- It's about...

346
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,158
Well, in Finland, we, um...
they have this saying

347
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,556
which I can't quite remember now,
it's, um...

348
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,476
It's about opening yourself up
to the people who want to love you.

349
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,036
And she is wide open lately.

350
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,596
What do you do?
- Oh, I work in finance.

351
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,676
What?
- What?

352
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,632
Across two firms,
one in Finland and one here.

353
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,680
No, no, she's a lawyer.

354
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:24,000
I thought you were a lawyer?
- No.

355
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,040
What?

356
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,232
I work with lawyers, I'm not a lawyer.

357
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,999
Darling, you are a solicitor.

358
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,759
I went to business school.

359
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,639
You're being so quiet!

360
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,080
Why aren't you saying anything?

361
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,156
What do you want me to say?
- Anything!

362
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,230
What's that in your hand?

363
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,576
She doesn't need to tell you.
- Birthday present from Dad.

364
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,670
It's a good thing, Claire.

365
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:47,999
Chunk of change?

366
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,320
No, it's, er...

367
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,476
- What is it?
- Dunno.

368
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,989
You don't need to...
- I love presents, I never get presents.

369
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,350
Well, it's because you might...
- It's a voucher.

370
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,955
For a counselling session.

371
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,353
Thanks, Dad.

372
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,717
So thoughtful!
- I'd kill for one of those.

373
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,496
I don't believe you can pay
your problems away

374
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,274
I think you have to face who you are
and suffer the consequences.

375
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,600
It's the only road to happiness.

376
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,600
Maybe happiness isn't in what you believe
but who you believe.

377
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,760
Fuck. Excuse me.

378
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,756
- Oh! Do you think she needs anything?
- No.

379
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,397
That was meant to be a bedroom present.

380
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,559
A what?

381
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,513
A present that you open
in your bedroom, alone.

382
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,871
All my presents are bedroom presents,
aren't they?

383
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,237
Do you want some more wine?

384
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,320
Oh, yes.
- No.

385
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,520
Claire?

386
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,200
You've been ages.

387
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,520
Are you pissed off
or are you doing a poo?

388
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,840
Fuck.

389
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,240
Fuck it.

390
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,150
Claire, can we just...?

391
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,434
Have you got a sanitary towel?

392
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,430
Oh, no, but I know a waitress
who would jump on that request.

393
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,960
Do you want me to ask her?
- No!

394
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,631
OK, well, there are some
sturdy hand towels here.

395
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,798
Could try and fashion something
with wings out of these.

396
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,640
Yes, fine.

397
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,080
Open the door.

398
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,997
The fuck! Just give it! Fuck!

399
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,317
Give it to me! Don't come in!
- It's a period! It's not gonna bite me!

400
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,440
Don't look at it!
- I'm not looking at your period!

401
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,550
Just take this...

402
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,474
Oh, God.
- It's not a period

403
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,920
it's a fucking miscarriage, OK?

404
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,360
Jesus, Claire!

405
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,989
It's OK.

406
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,576
No, it's not OK,
you need to go to a hospital!

407
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,478
It's fine, I just need...

408
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,590
Let me just...
- No!

409
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,519
Just get your hands off my miscarriage!

410
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,440
It's mine.

411
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,590
It's mine.

412
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,200
OK.

413
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,080
Claire.

414
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,080
It's OK.

415
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,400
It's OK.

416
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,394
OK, we need to go to a hospital now.

417
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,880
Now.

418
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,680
Yes.

419
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,273
OK.
- OK.

420
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,550
OK.
- OK.

421
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,790
Come on.
- It's...

422
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,470
It's all good.
- OK.

423
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,794
Don't tell anyone.
- OK.

424
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,936
Let's get the coats, I'll get a taxi.
- I'll tell them I don't feel right.

425
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,879
OK.
- Thank you.

426
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,880
OK.

427
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,776
I've never been there,
I get antiques from there all the time.

428
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,759
I still haven't gone.
- Oh, really?

429
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,736
I can understand, it's a wonderful
place to buy things like that...

430
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,640
I don't like all the water, I'd love it if...
- Fuck it, I'm having some.

431
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,954
Sorry, darling.
- Oh, good girl! Have one night off.

432
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,118
Oh, wow! What did you say to her?

433
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,758
I, um...
- Oh, nothing. I just, er, just sit down.

434
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,870
Come on, it's a party.

435
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,920
Can I have some?

436
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:25,913
Oh, someone's suddenly getting
into the party spirit now!

437
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,960
Sit down!

438
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,880
What did you take in there?

439
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,435
Your sister is finally
a good influence on you.

440
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,678
No, we just suddenly realised
what a monumental fucking day this is!

441
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,039
Drink.

442
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,616
Honestly, just leave them in there
two minutes

443
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,996
and they're suddenly being teenagers again.

444
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,554
Shall I get another bottle?
- Yes!

445
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,600
OK!

446
00:20:42,601 --> 00:20:44,990
Where's the waitress?
- We were just talking about Venice

447
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,440
and this wonderful trip we had.

448
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,736
I mean, how many times have we said
we have to go to Venice?

449
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,070
I've always wanted to go there.
Top of my list.

450
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,600
It's great.
- Yeah, I know.

451
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,871
Oh, for fuck's sake, stop it!

452
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Are you OK?

453
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,710
Yeah, I'm, er...

454
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,715
Er...
- Is, um... is it?

455
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,196
No, I'm sorry, I just...

456
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,920
Here we go.

457
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,216
Sorry, I just...
- What's happened?

458
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,536
Nothing's happened.
- What's happened?

459
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,596
Something's happened.

460
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,793
Come on! Come on.

461
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,672
Well, spit it out.
- No secrets here.

462
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,280
I just had a little... I just had...

463
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,478
This is a safe space.
- I just...

464
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,592
I had a little miscarriage.

465
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,559
Oh, my God.

466
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,914
What?
- Um...

467
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,676
What the fuck?

468
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,837
Er...
- How far gone were you?

469
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,496
You should go to the hospital.
- Whose was it?

470
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,496
Maybe leave that for later.
- Was it the tooth man?

471
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,591
Hospital, now.
- What about the bill? Sit down.

472
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,736
No, I'll cover her, I'll cover you.

473
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,399
She doesn't want to go!
- Why?

474
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,016
Cos I'm stubborn,
and for some inexplicable reason

475
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,416
I'd rather stay here
and have a passive-aggressive party, so.

476
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,716
How far gone were you?
- Oh, it was very early stages.

477
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,036
You knew?
- I really think she should see a doctor.

478
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,912
Yeah, so do I.
- I thought you hadn't spoken?

479
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,680
She's fine. She's absolutely fine!

480
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,679
Drink.

481
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,830
If it's gone, it's gone!

482
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,354
Claire...
- What if it's not gone?

483
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,720
It's gone.

484
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,712
- Darling, please...
- Probably ectopic.

485
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,640
Awful.

486
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,996
I'll pay you back.
- D'you need someone to go with you?

487
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,256
No, I think I'll just deal with this
in my own insane, irrational

488
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,316
anal way, if that's OK.

489
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,839
That's probably for the best.

490
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,277
What'd you say?
- Ignore him, he's been drinking.

491
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,880
What?
- Just, you know...

492
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,196
it's like a goldfish out the bowl,
sort of thing.

493
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,296
If it didn't wanna be in there,
it didn't wanna be in there

494
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,436
something wasn't right.

495
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,560
What?

496
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,992
It's the kid's choice
if it wants to jump ship, right?

497
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,316
- No, Martin, just...
- Either way...

498
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,155
she got her spotlight.

499
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,559
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- What the fuck?

500
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,991
Fuck! Oh, fuck!

501
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,319
Jeez... Jesus Chr...!
- Is there anything I can do?

502
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,080
Fuck! Argh!
- Oh, for God's sake!

503
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,670
Can I do anything?

504
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,800
No, thank you.

505
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,400
They've gone.

506
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,600
So...

507
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,640
Thank you.

508
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,760
Fucking hell.

509
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,719
Oh, hey.

510
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,473
Uh, I got your stuff.

511
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,720
You OK?
- Thanks.

512
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,360
Yeah, you OK?
- Yeah, yeah.

513
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:46,318
If you ever need someone to talk to,
or, you know, be there...

514
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,800
I'm always there.

515
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,040
Hey!

516
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,840
Hey!

517
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,960
Thank you.

518
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,960
Just tell him where you live
and we'll talk about this tomorrow.

519
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,136
Can you take us
to the nearest hospital, please?

520
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,160
Yeah.

521
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,749
The priest is quite hot.

522
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,800
So hot.
