1
00:02:34,857 --> 00:02:36,415
Hey, Jason. Come on.

2
00:02:39,295 --> 00:02:41,160
Jason, come on. Let's go.

3
00:03:06,422 --> 00:03:07,446
Jason?

4
00:05:34,336 --> 00:05:36,031
Baby.

5
00:05:36,238 --> 00:05:37,238
Whew.

6
00:05:43,312 --> 00:05:44,404
Sugar.

7
00:05:45,481 --> 00:05:46,521
You know, it makes me sick

8
00:05:46,648 --> 00:05:49,378
to see an American
classic defaced like that.

9
00:05:50,552 --> 00:05:51,746
Mm.

10
00:05:51,954 --> 00:05:54,479
If it makes you feel any better,
they were aiming for me.

11
00:05:55,157 --> 00:05:56,715
That makes sense.

12
00:05:56,925 --> 00:05:57,925
Come inside.

13
00:05:59,328 --> 00:06:01,088
You know there's nothing
on God's green earth

14
00:06:01,196 --> 00:06:05,257
that would get me to voluntarily
walk into a police station,

15
00:06:05,601 --> 00:06:07,125
but I was getting my fix on in town,

16
00:06:07,336 --> 00:06:10,203
figured I'd drop in,
see how you pulling this shit off.

17
00:06:10,406 --> 00:06:12,306
I mean, a crook posing as a cop

18
00:06:12,508 --> 00:06:15,409
and a car dealership
posing as a cop station?

19
00:06:15,611 --> 00:06:16,635
Hoo.

20
00:06:18,046 --> 00:06:19,513
You see Jason this morning?

21
00:06:19,615 --> 00:06:22,778
I thought he had a train to catch.

22
00:06:22,985 --> 00:06:25,886
Yeah, I went to his motel to take him
to the station. He wasn't there.

23
00:06:26,088 --> 00:06:28,079
Maybe he doesn't like
saying good-byes.

24
00:06:28,957 --> 00:06:30,982
He wouldn't have left without this.

25
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:36,695
You know, l-I did see him
last night at the Forge

26
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:39,060
talking to Proctor's niece.

27
00:06:39,268 --> 00:06:40,292
- Rebecca?
- Yeah.

28
00:06:40,502 --> 00:06:42,970
- When?
- Late.

29
00:06:43,172 --> 00:06:45,470
I'm pretty sure
they left together.

30
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,020
What, you think
something happened to him?

31
00:06:59,021 --> 00:07:00,147
Yeah.

32
00:07:01,723 --> 00:07:03,554
I just... I don't know what.

33
00:07:34,957 --> 00:07:36,390
- Morning.
- Sheriff.

34
00:07:36,592 --> 00:07:38,924
What brings you out
our way this morning?

35
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:41,819
I just came by for a little chat.

36
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,395
Well, do join us.

37
00:07:43,932 --> 00:07:46,662
No. Only be a minute.

38
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:48,734
- Hey.
- Hi.

39
00:07:50,072 --> 00:07:52,097
You left the Forge
with someone last night.

40
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:54,835
Late 20s, blond hair.

41
00:07:56,378 --> 00:07:58,073
What seems to be the problem?

42
00:07:59,548 --> 00:08:01,209
Well, he's missing.

43
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:03,748
There were, uh...

44
00:08:03,952 --> 00:08:05,647
signs of struggle in his motel room.

45
00:08:06,755 --> 00:08:08,017
And what would Rebecca
know about that?

46
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,510
That's what I'm here to find out.

47
00:08:09,558 --> 00:08:11,025
Who is this man?

48
00:08:11,226 --> 00:08:12,523
We don't know that yet.

49
00:08:12,728 --> 00:08:13,990
Do you have a name?

50
00:08:14,196 --> 00:08:15,716
So you're gonna try
and tell me that...

51
00:08:16,732 --> 00:08:18,256
you don't know him?

52
00:08:18,467 --> 00:08:19,627
I don't know him.

53
00:08:20,969 --> 00:08:22,095
I did fuck him, though.

54
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,432
We don't always know
the people we fuck,

55
00:08:26,642 --> 00:08:27,666
do we?

56
00:08:35,317 --> 00:08:36,909
So...

57
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,610
you were in his motel room, right?

58
00:08:40,756 --> 00:08:41,984
- For a little bit.
- How long?

59
00:08:43,425 --> 00:08:44,722
I left after he fell asleep.

60
00:08:44,927 --> 00:08:47,327
- Your uncle come pick you up?
- Was there a crime committed?

61
00:08:47,362 --> 00:08:49,387
No, I'm just trying
to make a timeline here.

62
00:08:49,598 --> 00:08:51,532
Why don't you tell me what happened?

63
00:08:52,868 --> 00:08:54,988
- What happened?
- Are you accusing us of something...

64
00:08:55,037 --> 00:08:58,495
- Why would I do that?
- No, indeed, why would you do that?

65
00:08:58,707 --> 00:09:01,107
You have no evidence, no body.

66
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:04,404
There's not even a name, you say.

67
00:09:04,613 --> 00:09:07,207
It doesn't sound to me
there's a crime committed...

68
00:09:07,482 --> 00:09:08,482
was there?

69
00:09:10,619 --> 00:09:12,814
Are you sure
you don't want anything to eat?

70
00:09:18,193 --> 00:09:19,626
You going along with this?

71
00:09:28,036 --> 00:09:29,663
He said he was leaving town.

72
00:09:29,871 --> 00:09:31,133
I assume he did.

73
00:09:39,414 --> 00:09:41,245
This was your choice.

74
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,042
When I come for him, I come for you.

75
00:09:52,894 --> 00:09:55,328
I have a busy day ahead of me.
I should go.

76
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,462
It's Siobhan, boss.

77
00:10:43,345 --> 00:10:45,404
- Yeah?
- Heard you were in earlier.

78
00:10:45,614 --> 00:10:47,241
Just wondering
when you'd be back in.

79
00:10:47,449 --> 00:10:49,246
I'm drawing up
the patrol schedule.

80
00:11:01,129 --> 00:11:02,687
I'll be back in an hour.

81
00:11:02,898 --> 00:11:04,695
Copy. See you then.

82
00:11:07,803 --> 00:11:10,431
So you think Proctor killed Jason?

83
00:11:11,573 --> 00:11:13,768
And he wanted me to know it.

84
00:11:13,975 --> 00:11:17,069
Just because the boy
slept with his niece.

85
00:11:18,547 --> 00:11:20,674
That's a new low for Proctor.

86
00:11:20,882 --> 00:11:24,079
Fuck this shit.
I need a motherfucking break.

87
00:11:24,286 --> 00:11:26,584
I've been up for the past 72 hours

88
00:11:26,788 --> 00:11:29,552
hacking into every server
I know looking for Rabbit.

89
00:11:29,758 --> 00:11:32,591
Whatever hole that Boris Karloff
motherfucker is in,

90
00:11:32,794 --> 00:11:33,954
it is deep and dark.

91
00:11:40,502 --> 00:11:44,336
- Who died?
- The kid, Jason.

92
00:11:45,907 --> 00:11:47,101
How?

93
00:11:47,843 --> 00:11:49,037
Proctor.

94
00:11:53,448 --> 00:11:54,540
Damn.

95
00:11:55,617 --> 00:11:57,915
I guess we'd better
get out the gloves and shovel.

96
00:11:58,186 --> 00:12:00,017
I'm not burying
anyone else this month.

97
00:12:00,222 --> 00:12:03,885
Anyone really gonna mind
if I bury Proctor?

98
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,826
Proctor's got too much juice here.

99
00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:10,623
You can't go after
a man like that head-on

100
00:12:10,832 --> 00:12:13,130
and not expect some major blowback.

101
00:12:13,335 --> 00:12:16,202
Most people are happy
with one psychopath after them.

102
00:12:16,505 --> 00:12:18,405
You really want two?

103
00:12:19,474 --> 00:12:20,668
I'll take my chances.

104
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,401
No, that's the con talking.

105
00:12:25,781 --> 00:12:27,373
I am a con.

106
00:12:27,582 --> 00:12:29,914
Well, you could've fooled me
this morning.

107
00:12:30,118 --> 00:12:34,680
What I'm saying is
there's a lot of ways to bury a man.

108
00:12:36,424 --> 00:12:39,188
Especially when
you're wearing that badge.

109
00:13:02,851 --> 00:13:04,250
- Hey.
- Hey.

110
00:13:04,452 --> 00:13:05,817
Got a minute?

111
00:13:06,021 --> 00:13:08,046
Uh, I got a patrol.

112
00:13:08,256 --> 00:13:09,951
I was hoping to
pick your brain a bit.

113
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:15,029
What's up?

114
00:13:16,698 --> 00:13:18,029
Hypothetically...

115
00:13:19,568 --> 00:13:21,934
if you were gonna take down Proctor,
how would you do it?

116
00:13:23,004 --> 00:13:24,835
Oh, you're gonna
go after Proctor, huh?

117
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:27,675
What exactly are you gonna
take him down for?

118
00:13:27,876 --> 00:13:29,104
Anything.

119
00:13:29,845 --> 00:13:31,039
Everything.

120
00:13:31,246 --> 00:13:32,975
Yeah, I think I'm gonna need you
to be a little more specific.

121
00:13:33,248 --> 00:13:34,510
- You know what? Forget it.
- Listen, Hood.

122
00:13:34,716 --> 00:13:36,836
Proctor's got his fingers
in everything around here...

123
00:13:36,918 --> 00:13:38,886
prostitution, drugs, extortion.

124
00:13:39,087 --> 00:13:40,952
The problem is,
he's always one step removed.

125
00:13:41,156 --> 00:13:42,453
There's no direct ties,

126
00:13:42,657 --> 00:13:45,751
and he knows exactly
how to walk that line.

127
00:13:45,961 --> 00:13:46,961
So, good luck.

128
00:13:47,128 --> 00:13:48,686
You've been here a long time.

129
00:13:50,398 --> 00:13:52,127
If you were sheriff,
how would you do it?

130
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,703
If I were sheriff.

131
00:13:57,939 --> 00:13:59,167
If I were sheriff...

132
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:03,204
I'd start by shaking his trees.

133
00:14:05,814 --> 00:14:07,577
- Which trees?
- All of 'em,

134
00:14:07,816 --> 00:14:10,046
repeatedly, over and over

135
00:14:10,252 --> 00:14:12,482
till something we can use
falls out of them.

136
00:14:13,588 --> 00:14:15,715
- Something we can use?
- Come on, Hood.

137
00:14:15,924 --> 00:14:18,244
You don't think I'm gonna
let you have all the fun, do you?

138
00:14:21,596 --> 00:14:25,123
All right, let's go find a tree.

139
00:14:34,676 --> 00:14:35,676
Excuse me...

140
00:14:43,885 --> 00:14:47,048
Mr. Thompson, do you know who I am?

141
00:14:47,255 --> 00:14:48,722
- Yeah.
- Good,

142
00:14:48,924 --> 00:14:51,222
then we can skip an introduction.

143
00:14:51,426 --> 00:14:53,553
George Hunter has engaged the council

144
00:14:53,762 --> 00:14:55,696
in a campaign to oust Alex Longshadow

145
00:14:55,897 --> 00:14:58,661
from the position of chief
with a no-confidence vote.

146
00:14:58,867 --> 00:15:00,960
However, it's in the interests
of numerous parties

147
00:15:01,169 --> 00:15:03,262
that this vote does not pass,

148
00:15:03,471 --> 00:15:06,440
and you, my friend,
just became one of those parties.

149
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:13,011
- Do you know what these are?
- No.

150
00:15:13,214 --> 00:15:16,843
These are the keys to your daughter's
college dormitory and dorm room.

151
00:15:17,886 --> 00:15:20,218
Cora's doing pretty well.

152
00:15:20,422 --> 00:15:21,548
You must be proud.

153
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:27,322
So I can count on your cooperation?

154
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,600
Yeah.

155
00:15:33,802 --> 00:15:35,064
Good.

156
00:15:36,371 --> 00:15:37,395
Who's next?

157
00:15:48,817 --> 00:15:50,409
Max, dinner!

158
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,613
Come on, Max. It's not cereal.

159
00:15:54,823 --> 00:15:55,943
Max, I'm not kidding around.

160
00:15:56,091 --> 00:15:57,615
If you don't get over here
right now and eat this,

161
00:15:57,826 --> 00:15:59,191
I'm gonna eat this.

162
00:15:59,394 --> 00:16:01,521
Max? Max?

163
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:02,992
Max!

164
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:05,564
Maxie! Max!

165
00:16:05,767 --> 00:16:07,894
Breathe, Max! Max, breathe!

166
00:16:08,103 --> 00:16:09,297
Fuck!

167
00:16:12,207 --> 00:16:13,207
Jesus.

168
00:16:14,676 --> 00:16:16,007
You've reached Gordon Hopewell.

169
00:16:16,211 --> 00:16:17,644
Please leave your name and number.

170
00:16:17,846 --> 00:16:18,846
Shit, Dad, it's Max.

171
00:16:19,014 --> 00:16:20,311
He's having an attack
and I don't know what to do.

172
00:16:20,515 --> 00:16:22,073
Can you call me, please?

173
00:16:22,283 --> 00:16:23,580
You've reached Gordon Hopewell.

174
00:16:23,785 --> 00:16:25,252
Please leave your name and number.

175
00:16:29,991 --> 00:16:31,231
You've reached Gordon Hopewell.

176
00:16:31,359 --> 00:16:32,917
Please leave your name and number.

177
00:16:37,966 --> 00:16:38,966
Fuck.

178
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,534
Emergency Services.

179
00:16:46,741 --> 00:16:47,969
Yeah, um, I need an ambulance.

180
00:16:48,176 --> 00:16:50,007
My brother's having an attack.
Please help.

181
00:16:50,211 --> 00:16:52,645
He has asthma.
Can you please hurry?

182
00:17:03,792 --> 00:17:04,850
How we doing?

183
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,288
We're good to go.

184
00:17:06,494 --> 00:17:08,086
All right, listen,
any illegal activity

185
00:17:08,296 --> 00:17:09,816
will be happening
off the east hallway.

186
00:17:09,898 --> 00:17:11,593
That is right behind
the dressing areas.

187
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,600
That's where the private rooms are,
all right?

188
00:17:13,635 --> 00:17:15,115
So let's split up when we get inside.

189
00:17:15,203 --> 00:17:16,693
Two stay in front, two hit the back.

190
00:17:17,772 --> 00:17:19,433
Did you copy that?

191
00:17:19,641 --> 00:17:21,632
You're pretty familiar
with the layout.

192
00:17:21,843 --> 00:17:23,310
Don’t judge. Let's go.

193
00:17:43,631 --> 00:17:44,996
That's my girl!

194
00:17:53,408 --> 00:17:55,103
Banshee Sheriff's Department!

195
00:17:56,478 --> 00:17:58,503
Banshee Sheriff's!

196
00:17:58,713 --> 00:18:00,203
- Hey!
- I'll hit the lights.

197
00:18:00,415 --> 00:18:02,383
Yeah, music, too.

198
00:18:02,584 --> 00:18:03,584
Hey.

199
00:18:05,453 --> 00:18:06,784
Banshee Sheriff's Department.

200
00:18:06,988 --> 00:18:08,922
- Everybody stay where you are.
- Siobhan.

201
00:18:09,124 --> 00:18:10,524
No one's in trouble. I just need...

202
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,252
dancers, please head to the back.

203
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:15,224
Patrons, gather up your stuff,
start heading to the front door.

204
00:18:17,665 --> 00:18:19,189
All right, ladies,
let's wrap this up.

205
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,367
- What the fuck?
- Emmett, come get

206
00:18:20,568 --> 00:18:21,694
these girls out the front.

207
00:18:21,903 --> 00:18:23,427
- Do you know who owns this place?
- Sure do.

208
00:18:23,638 --> 00:18:24,605
Then you know
it's off-limits to the cops.

209
00:18:24,806 --> 00:18:25,806
Yeah, not anymore.

210
00:18:25,974 --> 00:18:27,202
You have no idea...

211
00:18:28,877 --> 00:18:31,402
You tell Proctor
nothing's off-limits to me anymore.

212
00:18:34,249 --> 00:18:35,249
Really?

213
00:18:38,753 --> 00:18:40,380
What'd you say your name was?

214
00:18:40,588 --> 00:18:41,588
Passion.

215
00:18:43,892 --> 00:18:44,892
Passion.

216
00:18:46,494 --> 00:18:48,086
All right, Banshee Sheriff...

217
00:18:55,537 --> 00:18:57,300
You two, out the front now.

218
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,048
Picked a bad night, Gordon.

219
00:19:11,252 --> 00:19:13,083
We're busting the place
for prostitution.

220
00:19:13,288 --> 00:19:15,722
Well, that's crack
detective work, Sheriff.

221
00:19:15,924 --> 00:19:18,256
I mean, it's only Banshee's
worst-kept secret.

222
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:24,650
Wait five minutes and go out
the back. No one will see you.

223
00:19:24,732 --> 00:19:26,495
Oh, what, are you
doing me favors now?

224
00:19:26,701 --> 00:19:28,621
Well, fuck you.
I don't need your fucking favors.

225
00:19:28,636 --> 00:19:30,236
Hey, trust me, asshole.
It's not for you.

226
00:19:30,371 --> 00:19:31,371
Yeah, fuck you.

227
00:19:32,941 --> 00:19:33,941
You ride into town

228
00:19:34,142 --> 00:19:36,110
and this fucking tidal wave of shit

229
00:19:36,311 --> 00:19:38,472
follows you like a fucking plague.

230
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,808
Are you fucking my wife?

231
00:19:47,255 --> 00:19:48,882
- No.
- Bullshit.

232
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,410
Get the fuck out of here, Gordon.

233
00:19:57,065 --> 00:19:58,065
You finished?

234
00:20:01,269 --> 00:20:02,463
You fuckin'...

235
00:20:03,938 --> 00:20:04,938
Fuck!

236
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,980
Come on, let's get you out of here.

237
00:20:21,456 --> 00:20:22,480
What is this? Come on!

238
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,487
Come on, get off him!

239
00:20:24,692 --> 00:20:26,319
Come on. Lucas, Lucas.

240
00:20:26,527 --> 00:20:28,495
- Fuckin' piece of shit!
- God, cool off!

241
00:20:28,696 --> 00:20:30,960
Jesus Christ, what is this, huh?

242
00:20:32,066 --> 00:20:33,066
You all right?

243
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,777
You wanna tell me
why I just broke up a fight

244
00:20:43,978 --> 00:20:45,338
between the sheriff and the mayor?

245
00:20:46,381 --> 00:20:50,010
- It's complicated.
- You can talk to me, all right?

246
00:20:50,218 --> 00:20:52,345
- And not just because we're sleep...
- I know, I know.

247
00:21:04,465 --> 00:21:06,592
Dr. Valerian to OR1.

248
00:21:06,801 --> 00:21:08,826
Dr. Valerian to OR1.

249
00:21:23,418 --> 00:21:25,386
It's okay, I'm here.

250
00:21:25,586 --> 00:21:26,586
I'm here.

251
00:21:44,872 --> 00:21:46,772
Believe you me,
in a situation like this,

252
00:21:46,974 --> 00:21:49,306
we're just trying our best
to cover all the bases.

253
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,909
I wouldn't take it personally.

254
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,444
Just gonna ask you a couple of
questions. Shouldn't take too long.

255
00:21:54,615 --> 00:21:56,845
Sorry, just to clarify, where did you
say you went to law school?

256
00:21:56,984 --> 00:21:59,316
Did you see somebody pay me
to stick his dick in my ass?

257
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,748
- No.
- No, thank God.

258
00:22:00,955 --> 00:22:02,718
So, what do I know about
a fucking prostitution ring?

259
00:22:02,924 --> 00:22:04,284
All right, so let me just confirm,

260
00:22:04,425 --> 00:22:05,915
your name is Platinum?

261
00:22:06,127 --> 00:22:08,254
Platinumm. Two Ms. Platinumm.

262
00:22:08,463 --> 00:22:10,897
- Platinumm.
- Like, "Mm, she looked good."

263
00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:12,566
Half of them claimed
they didn't know anything

264
00:22:12,767 --> 00:22:14,200
about organized prostitution.

265
00:22:14,402 --> 00:22:15,762
They got paid to dance. That's it.

266
00:22:15,903 --> 00:22:17,165
Jesus Christ.

267
00:22:17,372 --> 00:22:19,772
The smart ones won't even
admit to that until they lawyer up.

268
00:22:19,974 --> 00:22:21,669
We caught some of them in the act.

269
00:22:21,876 --> 00:22:23,356
Well, they say
they were acting alone.

270
00:22:23,411 --> 00:22:24,708
They claim Proctor didn't
know anything about it.

271
00:22:24,912 --> 00:22:26,072
This is fucking ridiculous.

272
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,840
Yes, it is, and that's why
they call it police work.

273
00:22:37,925 --> 00:22:38,925
Hey.

274
00:22:40,728 --> 00:22:42,696
- You okay?
- Hey.

275
00:22:45,066 --> 00:22:46,066
I'm great.

276
00:22:48,503 --> 00:22:50,061
One of the girls
is asking for you.

277
00:22:53,574 --> 00:22:55,454
Excuse me, I'm looking
for my son, Max Hopewell.

278
00:22:55,543 --> 00:22:57,238
Someone downstairs
said he was up here.

279
00:22:57,445 --> 00:22:59,470
- Max...
- Hopewell. He has asthma and he...

280
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,511
Are... are you all right?

281
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,582
Never mind.

282
00:23:11,926 --> 00:23:13,518
Where is he?

283
00:23:13,728 --> 00:23:14,922
He's with the doctor now.

284
00:23:17,198 --> 00:23:18,198
Deva, what happened?

285
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:21,464
- Deva...
- Where were you?

286
00:23:21,669 --> 00:23:23,830
- I was working.
- Bullshit, I called your office.

287
00:23:24,038 --> 00:23:25,318
He could have fucking died, Dad.

288
00:23:25,506 --> 00:23:26,700
- I'm sorry, Deva.
- I don't give a shit

289
00:23:26,908 --> 00:23:29,206
if you're sorry.
Jesus fucking Christ, Dad.

290
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:31,002
Do you even see
how fucked up you are?

291
00:23:31,212 --> 00:23:32,907
- It's all right. I just...
- No, it's not all right.

292
00:23:33,114 --> 00:23:35,173
Nothing about this is all right.

293
00:23:35,383 --> 00:23:38,716
We are so fucked.
This whole family is so fucked.

294
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,820
- Deva...
- Get off me!

295
00:23:41,022 --> 00:23:42,284
Gordon, let her go.

296
00:23:45,092 --> 00:23:46,354
She called you.

297
00:23:50,731 --> 00:23:51,731
Look, tonight was...

298
00:23:51,899 --> 00:23:54,459
Gordon, you don't have to
explain yourself.

299
00:23:54,669 --> 00:23:56,068
Least of all to me.

300
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,295
- Mr. And Mrs. Hopewell?
- Yes.

301
00:23:58,506 --> 00:24:00,633
Dr. Kessler,
I'm the resident on duty.

302
00:24:00,842 --> 00:24:02,400
- How is he?
- Max is stable.

303
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:03,941
He suffered from an acute attack.

304
00:24:04,145 --> 00:24:05,442
How?

305
00:24:05,646 --> 00:24:07,011
We're really good about his meds

306
00:24:07,215 --> 00:24:08,773
and he always has his inhaler nearby.

307
00:24:08,983 --> 00:24:10,473
Nobody did anything wrong.

308
00:24:10,718 --> 00:24:12,481
His condition is deteriorating.

309
00:24:12,687 --> 00:24:14,416
His medicine is no longer
as effective.

310
00:24:14,622 --> 00:24:17,147
It looks like you already
talked to Max's pulmonologist

311
00:24:17,358 --> 00:24:18,918
- about leukotriene modifiers...
- Yeah.

312
00:24:19,093 --> 00:24:21,561
...beta agonists...
- Yeah, yeah, we thought...

313
00:24:21,762 --> 00:24:25,391
we thought we had more time
before all that was necessary.

314
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,465
You need to talk to his doctor.

315
00:24:27,668 --> 00:24:29,795
I'm gonna go check on Max.
I'll be right back.

316
00:24:39,847 --> 00:24:41,712
Mr. Proctor.

317
00:24:41,916 --> 00:24:44,942
Sheamus, please explain
to me why we're closed.

318
00:24:45,152 --> 00:24:46,915
They came in here,
they busted everybody,

319
00:24:47,121 --> 00:24:48,850
and they took our girls.

320
00:24:49,056 --> 00:24:50,546
That's basically what happened.

321
00:24:51,692 --> 00:24:52,692
Very unfortunate.

322
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,555
Obviously not your fault.

323
00:24:54,762 --> 00:24:56,059
Just give me the arrest warrant.

324
00:24:56,264 --> 00:24:57,544
I'll take it up with my lawyers.

325
00:24:59,734 --> 00:25:02,828
- The warrant?
- Yeah, the arrest warrant.

326
00:25:03,037 --> 00:25:04,595
I'm sure you didn't let
a bunch of cops come in here

327
00:25:04,805 --> 00:25:07,330
and shut down my business
without a legal arrest warrant.

328
00:25:07,542 --> 00:25:09,742
They just came through the front door
locked and loaded.

329
00:25:09,744 --> 00:25:11,041
What do you expect me to do?

330
00:25:21,923 --> 00:25:25,188
What I expect you to do
is what I pay you to do.

331
00:25:25,393 --> 00:25:27,953
Keep my club open.

332
00:25:29,363 --> 00:25:30,421
Got that?

333
00:25:43,878 --> 00:25:45,243
Now clean this place up.

334
00:25:45,446 --> 00:25:47,812
I want it open by tomorrow...

335
00:25:48,015 --> 00:25:49,107
for lunch.

336
00:25:58,292 --> 00:26:00,658
I don't know what
we're gonna do about this.

337
00:26:00,861 --> 00:26:03,022
We're gonna talk to
the insurance company again.

338
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,830
They've gotta be
willing to pay for more.

339
00:26:04,865 --> 00:26:07,891
They say that Max's asthma
has a chronic condition limit,

340
00:26:08,102 --> 00:26:09,797
and if they don't think
the asthma's gonna get any better,

341
00:26:10,004 --> 00:26:11,835
then they're not gonna
approve new treatment.

342
00:26:16,577 --> 00:26:19,045
We're just gonna have to pay
for the treatments ourselves.

343
00:26:19,246 --> 00:26:21,180
Where are we gonna
get cash like that?

344
00:26:26,253 --> 00:26:29,313
God damn it, how did I let things
get this screwed up?

345
00:26:39,066 --> 00:26:41,193
You're a good father, Gordon.

346
00:26:52,847 --> 00:26:55,475
They're not gonna
say anything about Proctor.

347
00:26:55,683 --> 00:26:57,651
They're more scared of him than you.

348
00:26:57,852 --> 00:26:59,046
And you're not?

349
00:27:00,154 --> 00:27:02,145
Proctor owns this whole town.

350
00:27:02,356 --> 00:27:04,221
He doesn't own me.

351
00:27:04,425 --> 00:27:05,551
How about you?

352
00:27:11,132 --> 00:27:13,293
No one owns me.

353
00:27:15,102 --> 00:27:16,102
Okay.

354
00:27:17,405 --> 00:27:18,702
So, what do you got?

355
00:27:35,189 --> 00:27:36,189
So...

356
00:27:37,892 --> 00:27:39,519
I see him three to four times a week.

357
00:27:39,727 --> 00:27:43,663
- He pays you?
- Mm-hmm, but he calls them gifts.

358
00:27:45,366 --> 00:27:47,300
And what would he do
if you said no?

359
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:50,766
He'd get me fired from the club
and I need the money.

360
00:27:50,971 --> 00:27:52,836
So, what do you want to tell me?

361
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,009
If I gave you something on Proctor,

362
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:57,700
would you put him away?

363
00:27:57,912 --> 00:27:59,345
Could you even put him away?

364
00:27:59,547 --> 00:28:01,378
Depends what it is.

365
00:28:01,582 --> 00:28:03,462
- Would I have to testify?
- Depends what it is.

366
00:28:03,517 --> 00:28:05,781
Well, I won't testify,
and you have to promise me...

367
00:28:05,986 --> 00:28:07,351
I can't promise you anything
until I know what you've got.

368
00:28:07,555 --> 00:28:08,647
And he can't know it's me.

369
00:28:08,856 --> 00:28:10,483
Listen, I got a jail full of whores
I can do this with.

370
00:28:10,691 --> 00:28:11,817
And I have a...

371
00:28:13,127 --> 00:28:14,287
I have a son.

372
00:28:17,732 --> 00:28:18,732
Fuck.

373
00:28:18,933 --> 00:28:21,367
Listen, if what you've got
is big enough to put Proctor away,

374
00:28:21,569 --> 00:28:23,127
I'll do everything I can
to keep you out of it.

375
00:28:23,337 --> 00:28:25,657
That's as close to a promise
as you're gonna get right now.

376
00:28:27,575 --> 00:28:28,575
No?

377
00:28:29,677 --> 00:28:31,941
There was this guy I used to see.

378
00:28:33,013 --> 00:28:34,013
A client.

379
00:28:36,417 --> 00:28:38,737
He used to drive trucks
for Proctor, running X into Philly.

380
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:39,919
Ecstasy?

381
00:28:40,087 --> 00:28:41,748
He said Proctor has this place
where they do it all...

382
00:28:41,956 --> 00:28:44,015
cook it, pack it, and ship it off.

383
00:28:44,225 --> 00:28:45,225
You know his name?

384
00:28:48,095 --> 00:28:49,095
Matt Sharp.

385
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:52,799
Where do I find him?

386
00:28:54,135 --> 00:28:55,135
Hey.

387
00:28:56,337 --> 00:28:58,202
I'm looking for Matt Sharp.

388
00:28:58,405 --> 00:28:59,497
I'm Sharp.

389
00:29:01,542 --> 00:29:03,635
Irony. Nice.

390
00:29:03,844 --> 00:29:05,004
I need to talk to you for a minute.

391
00:29:05,212 --> 00:29:07,339
I'm on the clock, Sheriff.

392
00:29:07,548 --> 00:29:11,177
I don't know if you heard,
but the market's down,

393
00:29:11,385 --> 00:29:13,979
unemployment's at 9%.

394
00:29:14,188 --> 00:29:17,055
You wouldn't want to keep an honest
man from making a buck, would ya?

395
00:29:17,258 --> 00:29:18,555
An honest man, no.

396
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:21,227
You? Eh, I could give a shit.

397
00:29:21,395 --> 00:29:23,761
Listen, guys, we just got
a couple of questions for you.

398
00:29:23,964 --> 00:29:25,761
You're gonna want
to put that down.

399
00:29:25,966 --> 00:29:27,399
Are you one of those
affirmative action hires?

400
00:29:27,601 --> 00:29:29,831
Hey. How do you like sitting
in the front seat versus the back?

401
00:29:30,037 --> 00:29:31,037
Not as good as it'll feel

402
00:29:31,172 --> 00:29:33,265
when I put my boot
up your ass and out your mouth.

403
00:29:33,474 --> 00:29:35,101
- Whoa.
- Hey, we're just messing around.

404
00:29:35,309 --> 00:29:36,503
We didn't mean nothing by it.

405
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:40,202
Yeah, spic, slope,
coon, kike, faggot.

406
00:29:40,414 --> 00:29:43,178
Soon as you put the uniform on,
we dislike you all the same.

407
00:29:44,351 --> 00:29:45,579
Yo, I recognize this dude.

408
00:29:45,786 --> 00:29:47,913
You're that football player, right?

409
00:29:48,122 --> 00:29:49,612
Real big deal in college.

410
00:29:49,824 --> 00:29:51,121
Running back.

411
00:29:51,325 --> 00:29:52,952
Yeah, what happened?
Did you quit?

412
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,286
Or did somebody figure out

413
00:29:54,495 --> 00:29:57,123
that a nigger running like he
stole something ain't nothing new?

414
00:30:00,334 --> 00:30:02,495
Emmett, be cool, all right?

415
00:30:02,703 --> 00:30:03,897
Emmett?

416
00:30:07,474 --> 00:30:09,567
- I'm cool.
- All right.

417
00:30:09,777 --> 00:30:11,506
Don't hold back on my account.

418
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,873
A verbal taunt
does not fulfill the protocol

419
00:30:14,081 --> 00:30:16,241
for self-defense, Sheriff,
only a life-threatening act.

420
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:18,870
And these little men aren't
what I'd consider to be threatening.

421
00:30:19,954 --> 00:30:21,387
Fuck you, O.J.

422
00:30:24,058 --> 00:30:25,458
I do believe I now feel threatened.

423
00:30:25,626 --> 00:30:26,626
I would.

424
00:30:31,532 --> 00:30:32,590
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

425
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,097
Don't you fucking move.

426
00:30:44,945 --> 00:30:46,003
Oh!

427
00:30:49,383 --> 00:30:50,441
You okay, Brock?

428
00:30:50,651 --> 00:30:52,448
No!

429
00:30:53,754 --> 00:30:54,948
Emmett, you need a hand?

430
00:30:56,056 --> 00:30:57,353
Oh, fuck.

431
00:31:01,729 --> 00:31:02,729
Emmett!

432
00:31:16,343 --> 00:31:17,674
- You all right?
- Yeah.

433
00:31:25,653 --> 00:31:28,486
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, Sharp.

434
00:31:28,689 --> 00:31:30,384
What do you want, cop?

435
00:31:30,591 --> 00:31:33,025
You're gonna tell me
about Proctor's ecstasy operation.

436
00:31:36,163 --> 00:31:38,688
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

437
00:31:38,899 --> 00:31:39,899
Okay.

438
00:31:41,835 --> 00:31:43,598
Let me get you started.

439
00:31:43,804 --> 00:31:45,863
You were a driver.

440
00:31:46,073 --> 00:31:47,938
You did runs from Banshee...

441
00:31:50,144 --> 00:31:51,441
...to Philly.

442
00:31:51,645 --> 00:31:52,839
Who told you that?

443
00:31:53,047 --> 00:31:54,742
Well, that's none of your business.

444
00:31:56,417 --> 00:31:59,614
You think I'm gonna roll on
someone like Proctor 'cause of you?

445
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,219
Ah!

446
00:32:01,422 --> 00:32:03,049
Go ahead, arrest me.

447
00:32:03,257 --> 00:32:04,588
At least in jail I got my health.

448
00:32:04,792 --> 00:32:07,386
Yeah, but right now...
I got your arm.

449
00:32:07,594 --> 00:32:09,289
Stop!

450
00:32:09,496 --> 00:32:11,589
- So tell me how it works.
- Fuck you.

451
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,962
Okay.

452
00:32:14,168 --> 00:32:16,261
- I was just a driver.
- Yeah, we covered that.

453
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:17,596
Now, how did it work?

454
00:32:18,672 --> 00:32:19,900
It was always at night.

455
00:32:20,107 --> 00:32:21,904
I'd pick up the trucks
from the factory,

456
00:32:22,109 --> 00:32:25,169
get 'em loaded, and then
drive from Banshee towards Philly.

457
00:32:25,379 --> 00:32:26,573
And?

458
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:29,510
All right. I'd have an address.

459
00:32:29,717 --> 00:32:31,617
Usually like some parking lot.

460
00:32:31,819 --> 00:32:34,413
I'd leave the truck with the keys
in the cab and then walk away.

461
00:32:34,621 --> 00:32:36,941
- And who took the trucks from there?
- I never saw anyone.

462
00:32:36,991 --> 00:32:38,549
The whole system's
rigged with cutouts

463
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:40,488
so no one knew more than they had to.

464
00:32:40,694 --> 00:32:42,161
But you got your orders
from Proctor, right?

465
00:32:42,363 --> 00:32:44,593
- I never even met him.
- Don't fuck with me, Sharp.

466
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:47,426
Fuck, I'm not!
I told you, I don't know shit!

467
00:32:47,634 --> 00:32:49,067
I can't argue with that.

468
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:51,762
But you do know where the factory is.

469
00:32:53,874 --> 00:32:55,808
Oh, fuck, man.

470
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:59,468
Near the brick factory
on Havershaw.

471
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,680
Thanks.

472
00:33:08,288 --> 00:33:09,778
Hey.

473
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,048
We're out.

474
00:33:38,018 --> 00:33:40,009
Well...

475
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,916
look what the parole officer
dragged in.

476
00:33:43,123 --> 00:33:44,147
I missed you.

477
00:33:44,358 --> 00:33:45,985
Oh, honey, I know.

478
00:33:46,193 --> 00:33:48,320
But I come bearing gifts.

479
00:33:54,268 --> 00:33:57,032
Your cut from the truck job.

480
00:33:57,237 --> 00:33:59,102
It's hardly retirement money...

481
00:34:05,012 --> 00:34:07,845
- You ain't gonna count it?
- I already know it won't be enough.

482
00:34:08,048 --> 00:34:09,572
Mm, you're telling me.

483
00:34:13,587 --> 00:34:15,282
Enough for what?

484
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:16,922
I need to do another one.

485
00:34:21,862 --> 00:34:23,386
And I need to stop
risking my fine ass

486
00:34:23,597 --> 00:34:24,996
over motherfucking milk money.

487
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,861
- This one's different.
- Oh, this one's different?

488
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:31,633
Then I'll gather the troops.

489
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:34,366
It's gotta be just you and me.

490
00:34:36,643 --> 00:34:40,170
Now, we all agreed
we were gonna do this together.

491
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,075
Moonlighting ain't my style.

492
00:34:42,282 --> 00:34:44,910
- I need this, Job.
- Join the motherfucking club.

493
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,245
It's not for me.

494
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:50,651
My son is sick.

495
00:34:58,532 --> 00:34:59,532
Mm.

496
00:35:01,034 --> 00:35:03,400
Who do I have to shoot
to get a motherfucking menu in here?

497
00:35:28,929 --> 00:35:31,363
Doesn't look very secure
for a drug lot.

498
00:35:31,565 --> 00:35:33,692
Yeah, that's what someone
wants you to think.

499
00:35:33,901 --> 00:35:37,997
They got cameras covering
the perimeter there, there.

500
00:35:38,205 --> 00:35:40,969
17-gauge wire along the fence line.

501
00:35:41,175 --> 00:35:43,143
It's electrified.

502
00:35:43,343 --> 00:35:45,436
And they got
motion sensors in the back.

503
00:35:47,748 --> 00:35:49,340
You can tell all that from here?

504
00:35:51,451 --> 00:35:52,645
Yeah, more or less.

505
00:35:52,853 --> 00:35:55,083
Well, we're gonna need
some time to get a warrant.

506
00:35:55,289 --> 00:35:56,449
What do you want to do?

507
00:35:57,791 --> 00:35:59,986
Let's find out who owns the place.

508
00:36:00,194 --> 00:36:02,355
Oh, you mean do some actual
police work. Sounds good.

509
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:18,705
Throughout our history

510
00:36:18,912 --> 00:36:21,005
we have stood behind brave leaders

511
00:36:21,215 --> 00:36:23,615
who protected
our culture and traditions

512
00:36:23,817 --> 00:36:26,718
from a world
that would see us gone.

513
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,879
Alex Longshadow comes from
a line of great Kinaho chiefs.

514
00:36:31,091 --> 00:36:33,116
No one has done more
for their people

515
00:36:33,327 --> 00:36:34,919
than Benjamin Longshadow...

516
00:36:36,029 --> 00:36:39,590
which is why it saddens me
that it has come to this.

517
00:36:41,235 --> 00:36:44,329
Alex simply lacks
the wisdom and experience

518
00:36:44,538 --> 00:36:48,907
to lead the Kinaho tribe
in these complicated times.

519
00:36:52,879 --> 00:36:54,642
That is why it is with a heavy heart

520
00:36:54,848 --> 00:36:57,373
that I call for this vote
of no confidence

521
00:36:57,584 --> 00:37:00,849
in Alex Longshadow as tribal chief.

522
00:37:01,722 --> 00:37:04,452
All in favor,
raise their hand and say, "Aye."

523
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:23,737
Thompson, you're gonna let
some thug scare you away

524
00:37:23,944 --> 00:37:26,071
from the ideals of your ancestors?

525
00:37:28,615 --> 00:37:31,413
Maybe we were too harsh
in our judgment.

526
00:37:31,618 --> 00:37:34,052
Alex is young and ambitious.

527
00:37:35,689 --> 00:37:38,123
Young blood may be
just what this tribe needs.

528
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,898
You have corrupted
this council and shamed yourself

529
00:37:49,102 --> 00:37:50,399
as well as your father.

530
00:37:51,738 --> 00:37:53,899
You gonna adjourn
this meeting, or what?

531
00:38:11,992 --> 00:38:13,459
What'd you do
to those guys, anyway?

532
00:38:15,028 --> 00:38:17,223
Your father was a man
of great wisdom.

533
00:38:17,431 --> 00:38:18,955
He knew, like you now know,

534
00:38:19,166 --> 00:38:21,498
that sometimes
the way over a mountain...

535
00:38:21,702 --> 00:38:23,431
is through it.

536
00:38:23,637 --> 00:38:24,637
And...

537
00:38:25,772 --> 00:38:27,296
going through the mountain...

538
00:38:28,442 --> 00:38:29,636
well...

539
00:38:32,012 --> 00:38:33,343
that's my specialty.

540
00:38:36,483 --> 00:38:38,542
Be well, Chief Longshadow.

541
00:38:44,791 --> 00:38:45,780
Property report lists the owner

542
00:38:45,992 --> 00:38:48,517
of the warehouse and land
as Wildflower, LLC.

543
00:38:48,729 --> 00:38:50,128
It's probably a shell company.

544
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:51,319
Proctor's name is nowhere near it.

545
00:38:51,531 --> 00:38:53,055
We'd pretty much
have to catch Proctor

546
00:38:53,266 --> 00:38:55,506
in the warehouse personally
cooking up a batch of ecstasy

547
00:38:55,702 --> 00:38:56,794
in order to make
the drug charges stick.

548
00:38:57,003 --> 00:38:58,643
Doesn't mean we can't
shut the place down.

549
00:38:58,705 --> 00:39:00,785
Proctor'll have another one up
and running in a week.

550
00:39:01,942 --> 00:39:04,410
You want me to see what I can find
on the shell company?

551
00:39:05,545 --> 00:39:08,013
Uh, yeah. Might as well.

552
00:39:08,215 --> 00:39:09,375
Hey, Emmett...

553
00:39:11,017 --> 00:39:12,644
sorry about what happened yesterday.

554
00:39:13,653 --> 00:39:15,917
You know, the shit at the junkyard.

555
00:39:16,123 --> 00:39:18,921
You know, every time
I think I'm immune to that stuff...

556
00:39:20,527 --> 00:39:23,325
I can only turn the other cheek
for so many times.

557
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:26,158
But it gave me a chance to be
a good Christian and kick some butt.

558
00:39:27,534 --> 00:39:29,365
And how were you a good Christian?

559
00:39:32,272 --> 00:39:33,796
I forgave them afterwards.

560
00:39:58,465 --> 00:39:59,989
Back to square one.

561
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,668
Is there some reason
you need to arrest Proctor today?

562
00:40:07,541 --> 00:40:10,601
Proctor does whatever he wants
to whoever he wants.

563
00:40:10,811 --> 00:40:13,905
Every day that list
gets a little bit longer.

564
00:40:14,114 --> 00:40:15,714
Been like that
since before you got here.

565
00:40:15,916 --> 00:40:17,476
That doesn't mean
it stays the same way.

566
00:40:28,895 --> 00:40:30,522
Don't you fucking move.

567
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:31,754
Hands behind your back.

568
00:40:31,965 --> 00:40:34,024
Hands behind your back. Do it!

569
00:40:35,268 --> 00:40:37,429
- Who's left in the warehouse?
- Nobody.

570
00:40:37,604 --> 00:40:39,265
Do you know whose shit
you're stealing?

571
00:40:39,473 --> 00:40:40,770
Who says we're stealing it?

572
00:40:43,243 --> 00:40:47,270
Listen, there's a right way
and a wrong way to get Proctor.

573
00:40:48,648 --> 00:40:49,706
So, you can drive this?

574
00:40:49,916 --> 00:40:51,406
Shit, back in the day,

575
00:40:51,618 --> 00:40:54,519
I used to run a big rig
cross-country in 92 hours.

576
00:40:54,721 --> 00:40:56,521
Well, shit's changed
since World War I, Sugar.

577
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:59,150
You know, I really was hoping
that he'd run your ass over.

578
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:00,359
Hey.

579
00:41:01,828 --> 00:41:03,295
You sure you want to do this?

580
00:41:04,364 --> 00:41:05,991
Go up against Proctor like this?

581
00:41:07,934 --> 00:41:11,734
You got your issues
with Proctor, I got mine.

582
00:41:12,939 --> 00:41:16,102
This is a war.
This isn't about one battle.

583
00:41:16,309 --> 00:41:17,606
You wanna win this thing?

584
00:41:17,811 --> 00:41:21,144
Just settle in, be patient.

585
00:41:21,348 --> 00:41:22,348
You're right.

586
00:41:27,487 --> 00:41:28,886
Damn.

587
00:41:30,957 --> 00:41:32,185
Is he drunk?

588
00:41:38,231 --> 00:41:40,426
Yeah, it's simple.

589
00:41:44,871 --> 00:41:47,669
- You take care of the cameras?
- Don't insult me, baby.

590
00:41:47,874 --> 00:41:49,000
All right, boys.

591
00:41:49,209 --> 00:41:50,801
Now, this is gonna hurt a little bit.

592
00:42:24,678 --> 00:42:25,678
Whoo!

593
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:26,373
God damn!

594
00:42:26,613 --> 00:42:28,808
Man, that's something
you don't get to do every day.

595
00:42:29,883 --> 00:42:32,784
- That gonna be enough?
- That's what the man said.

596
00:42:32,986 --> 00:42:34,386
Look, you gonna give us enough time

597
00:42:34,454 --> 00:42:36,115
to clear our asses outta here?

598
00:42:36,323 --> 00:42:38,814
What, you think we gonna
light a long fuse and run?

599
00:42:39,025 --> 00:42:40,890
This ain't a fuckin'
Road Runner cartoon.

600
00:42:41,094 --> 00:42:42,220
Sugar!

601
00:43:08,254 --> 00:43:09,346
Boom, motherfucker.

602
00:43:21,768 --> 00:43:22,768
What happened?

603
00:43:25,005 --> 00:43:26,336
I don't know.

604
00:43:28,408 --> 00:43:31,048
- Are you dialing the right number?
- Yes, I'm dialing the right...

605
00:43:32,112 --> 00:43:33,112
fuck!

606
00:43:33,279 --> 00:43:36,544
Bet you wish you had a long fuse
and a match right about now.

607
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:37,750
Fuck you, Sugar.

608
00:43:37,917 --> 00:43:38,975
Maybe it's a loose...

609
00:44:01,775 --> 00:44:02,969
Whoo.

610
00:44:04,144 --> 00:44:05,338
Mm-mm.

611
00:44:06,513 --> 00:44:07,639
Damn.

612
00:44:14,087 --> 00:44:16,681
Supposed to just blow the lab,

613
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:20,018
not put a goddamn crater
in the earth.

614
00:44:20,226 --> 00:44:22,057
Now tell me...

615
00:44:22,262 --> 00:44:26,722
that don't fill you with a warm,
tingling feeling inside.

616
00:44:26,933 --> 00:44:28,059
It's a start.

617
00:44:29,269 --> 00:44:30,463
I can't hear a thing.

618
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:31,967
That's 'cause you old and deaf.

619
00:44:32,172 --> 00:44:33,400
Don't put that shit on me.

620
00:44:33,606 --> 00:44:35,699
- What?
- "What"?

621
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:53,391
You know,
when you first got here,

622
00:44:53,593 --> 00:44:55,618
I didn't think
you were much of a cop.

623
00:44:55,829 --> 00:44:57,296
Yet you hid it so well.

624
00:44:57,497 --> 00:44:59,257
Oh, I still don't think
you're much of a cop.

625
00:44:59,399 --> 00:45:01,629
But I think you're serious
about getting Proctor,

626
00:45:01,835 --> 00:45:03,530
and this town's been waiting
for somebody to do that

627
00:45:03,737 --> 00:45:05,398
for a long, long time.

628
00:45:05,605 --> 00:45:07,436
And I was hoping
it was gonna be me.

629
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:14,742
But what I'm saying is
I don't mind that it's you.

630
00:45:21,254 --> 00:45:23,586
- That must've hurt.
- Like a prostate exam.
