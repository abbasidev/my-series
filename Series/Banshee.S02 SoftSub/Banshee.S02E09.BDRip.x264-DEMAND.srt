1
00:01:41,681 --> 00:01:43,911
And who might you be?

2
00:03:10,236 --> 00:03:13,103
- Who are you?
- I already told you.

3
00:03:13,306 --> 00:03:15,672
I wanted to let Jesus Christ
into my life.

4
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:18,810
I have a feeling you'll be meeting
Jesus quite soon.

5
00:03:19,012 --> 00:03:21,776
The only question is
how much it'll hurt before you do.

6
00:03:21,981 --> 00:03:24,381
What the fuck kind of priest are you?

7
00:03:24,584 --> 00:03:26,051
Please watch your language.

8
00:03:26,252 --> 00:03:28,220
Fuck you, motherfucker.

9
00:03:31,057 --> 00:03:33,389
There's no call for profanity.

10
00:03:34,427 --> 00:03:36,452
Spend some time
with our confused friend.

11
00:03:36,663 --> 00:03:39,131
See if you can show him the light.

12
00:03:44,237 --> 00:03:46,728
Well, I thought he'd never leave.

13
00:03:48,374 --> 00:03:51,275
See, now, that won't be necessary.

14
00:03:51,444 --> 00:03:52,672
Shut your mouth.

15
00:04:29,516 --> 00:04:30,881
- Fuck me.
- Down!

16
00:04:32,252 --> 00:04:34,117
Get him! I need him alive!

17
00:05:05,652 --> 00:05:06,778
Fuck!

18
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:12,918
Ah!

19
00:05:14,994 --> 00:05:16,188
Like that.

20
00:05:17,263 --> 00:05:18,423
Good morning, everybody.

21
00:05:18,631 --> 00:05:20,792
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey.

22
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,764
- Hi.
- That's sick! I love it.

23
00:05:25,204 --> 00:05:26,844
- That's pretty cool.
- How did you sleep?

24
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,507
Good.

25
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:29,970
- Do you like it?
- Yeah.

26
00:05:30,076 --> 00:05:32,670
Me, too. It's awesome.

27
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:34,938
Hey, you know what?
Let's go outside and try it out.

28
00:05:35,148 --> 00:05:37,844
- You gonna do an awesome trick?
- Oh, yeah.

29
00:05:38,051 --> 00:05:39,211
I think you are.

30
00:05:53,433 --> 00:05:55,765
I miss this.

31
00:05:55,969 --> 00:05:57,596
I missed you.

32
00:06:03,743 --> 00:06:05,404
Do you think
we could ever get it back?

33
00:06:09,382 --> 00:06:11,714
I don't know.

34
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:14,751
Probably not this,
but maybe something different.

35
00:06:14,954 --> 00:06:16,615
Something better?

36
00:06:22,996 --> 00:06:24,520
I'm sorry I lied to you.

37
00:06:26,799 --> 00:06:28,460
I know.

38
00:06:29,736 --> 00:06:32,034
Sometimes when you live
with a lie for long enough,

39
00:06:32,238 --> 00:06:34,001
it starts to feel like the truth.

40
00:06:34,207 --> 00:06:35,799
- Hey, Alma.
- Hey.

41
00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:38,136
Proctor arrest. You up for it?

42
00:06:38,344 --> 00:06:40,005
Sure looks like a lot of paperwork.

43
00:06:40,213 --> 00:06:41,680
How much is it gonna cost me?

44
00:06:41,881 --> 00:06:42,881
Are you kidding me?

45
00:06:43,049 --> 00:06:45,847
- It's Proctor. It's on the house.
- Thanks.

46
00:06:46,052 --> 00:06:48,782
Besides, we both know
you would just screw it up.

47
00:06:51,324 --> 00:06:53,053
- Hey, Emmett.
- Sheriff.

48
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:00,431
- You come for these?
- No.

49
00:07:00,633 --> 00:07:02,760
- I don't deserve that badge.
- Come on.

50
00:07:02,969 --> 00:07:04,834
No one deserves it more than you.

51
00:07:05,405 --> 00:07:06,770
Have you heard back
from the D.A.'s office?

52
00:07:06,973 --> 00:07:09,567
You let me worry
about the D.A., okay?

53
00:07:09,776 --> 00:07:11,539
- Listen, what I did to those men...
- They had it coming.

54
00:07:11,744 --> 00:07:14,235
- Not from me.
- Well, if not from you...

55
00:07:15,982 --> 00:07:19,145
Listen, Emmett, there are rules,

56
00:07:19,352 --> 00:07:21,552
- and then there's what's right.
- And then there's God.

57
00:07:21,921 --> 00:07:25,118
Yeah, God kind of takes all the fun
out of the argument.

58
00:07:27,093 --> 00:07:29,152
This job is doing something to me.

59
00:07:29,362 --> 00:07:32,092
I can't risk becoming the man
I was last night.

60
00:07:34,434 --> 00:07:37,301
- So, what are you gonna do?
- Meg's sister lives down in Florida.

61
00:07:37,503 --> 00:07:39,095
We're gonna head down there
for a while.

62
00:07:40,306 --> 00:07:41,898
See what it feels like.

63
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:48,144
I hate to lose you.

64
00:07:50,116 --> 00:07:52,414
You know,
you may have everyone else fooled,

65
00:07:52,618 --> 00:07:54,108
not me.

66
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:58,918
How's that?

67
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,752
I know you're a good man.

68
00:08:02,228 --> 00:08:03,628
It's been an honor
to work with you.

69
00:08:07,467 --> 00:08:08,832
You, too.

70
00:08:32,725 --> 00:08:35,694
Dr. Hadman to E.R. Bay 13.

71
00:08:35,895 --> 00:08:38,921
Dr. Hadman to E.R. Bay 13.

72
00:08:44,971 --> 00:08:46,632
Hey, man,

73
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:49,899
give me some fuckin' morphine.

74
00:08:50,109 --> 00:08:51,701
I'm dyin' here.

75
00:08:52,812 --> 00:08:56,748
I've been ringing this bell
for a fuckin' hour already.

76
00:08:56,949 --> 00:08:59,110
Where the fuck do you people go?

77
00:09:04,657 --> 00:09:05,851
Oh, shit.

78
00:09:06,058 --> 00:09:08,754
- That's right.
- You gotta tell Proctor

79
00:09:08,961 --> 00:09:10,292
I didn't tell them anything.

80
00:09:10,496 --> 00:09:12,396
By the time they came to me,

81
00:09:12,598 --> 00:09:14,395
they knew all about it.

82
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,127
What the fuck are you doing?
That's my fuckin' morphine drip!

83
00:09:20,206 --> 00:09:22,231
You won't be needing that anymore.

84
00:09:24,377 --> 00:09:27,505
You were paid to transport
Mr. Proctor's merchandise

85
00:09:27,713 --> 00:09:28,941
and keep your mouth shut.

86
00:09:29,148 --> 00:09:31,378
You chose to speak to
the authorities.

87
00:09:31,584 --> 00:09:35,577
As such, Mr. Proctor
has asked me to inform you

88
00:09:35,788 --> 00:09:38,382
that your services
will no longer be required.

89
00:09:38,591 --> 00:09:40,456
Get the fuck away from me...

90
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,649
What are you doing here, Sugar?

91
00:11:53,859 --> 00:11:55,690
You came to see me
when I was inside.

92
00:11:55,895 --> 00:11:58,125
I'm just returning the favor.

93
00:11:58,331 --> 00:12:01,459
Seeing if there's anything you need.

94
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:02,964
Yeah?

95
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:12,136
And where was your friendship
while Hood was making his plans?

96
00:12:12,345 --> 00:12:14,779
A simple warning
is all I would have needed.

97
00:12:14,981 --> 00:12:17,779
Hood, he doesn't consult with me.

98
00:12:17,984 --> 00:12:19,713
Yeah?

99
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:21,614
Would you have told me
if he had?

100
00:12:26,492 --> 00:12:28,084
Kai...

101
00:12:28,294 --> 00:12:30,592
I've known you
since you were a kid.

102
00:12:30,796 --> 00:12:32,388
We may not be friends,

103
00:12:32,598 --> 00:12:35,863
but in some way,
we're still family.

104
00:12:38,204 --> 00:12:41,867
We're not family. Not anymore.

105
00:12:42,074 --> 00:12:44,099
You made your choice.

106
00:12:45,311 --> 00:12:46,835
And don't come back.

107
00:12:49,749 --> 00:12:52,411
Kai, it doesn't have to be this way.

108
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,547
Yes, it does.

109
00:12:56,756 --> 00:12:59,156
I forgave what I could,
given the years you lost for me.

110
00:12:59,358 --> 00:13:02,156
But when I get out of here,
and I will get out of here,

111
00:13:02,361 --> 00:13:04,556
I'll be coming for Hood.

112
00:13:04,764 --> 00:13:07,062
And if you're standing between us,
I'll cut you down,

113
00:13:07,266 --> 00:13:08,858
without a second thought.

114
00:13:15,374 --> 00:13:17,239
You shouldn't have come here.

115
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:31,083
Hey, boss, we might have a glitch
with Proctor's case.

116
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:33,850
Just get your son and go.
You can't ever come back here.

117
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,528
Why are you helping me?

118
00:13:36,729 --> 00:13:39,197
I know what it feels like
to be trapped in your own life.

119
00:13:39,398 --> 00:13:41,332
I went to check on Juliet.

120
00:13:41,534 --> 00:13:43,593
She missed her shift at the Savoy.

121
00:13:43,803 --> 00:13:47,170
- And what about you?
- I made my choice.

122
00:13:47,373 --> 00:13:50,274
- Thank you.
- Just go.

123
00:13:50,476 --> 00:13:51,909
I swung by the day care center.

124
00:13:52,111 --> 00:13:54,471
Apparently, she pulled her son out
in the middle of the day.

125
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,445
The director there had a feeling
she's not coming back.

126
00:13:56,649 --> 00:13:58,139
Smart girl.

127
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,442
What about your case
against Proctor?

128
00:13:59,652 --> 00:14:01,586
She was never gonna testify.

129
00:14:02,788 --> 00:14:05,382
Anyway, we've got a stronger case
with Longshadow.

130
00:14:11,897 --> 00:14:13,194
Hi.

131
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:15,196
He has a list of people

132
00:14:15,401 --> 00:14:17,130
Proctor extorted to clear the land
for the new casino.

133
00:14:17,336 --> 00:14:19,804
And you think Longshadow's gonna
see that through?

134
00:14:20,005 --> 00:14:22,337
He wants Proctor out of his hair
for good.

135
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:25,533
The charges against my uncle
will soon be dropped.

136
00:14:25,744 --> 00:14:26,944
You've nothing to worry about.

137
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:29,240
But I am worried, Rebecca.

138
00:14:30,549 --> 00:14:32,269
I don't doubt for a moment
Proctor's lawyers

139
00:14:32,451 --> 00:14:34,817
will buy his way
out of a few gun charges.

140
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,147
The cops have papers
linking him to the Kinaho Moon

141
00:14:37,356 --> 00:14:38,653
and I can't have that.

142
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:41,385
That sounds like something

143
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,551
you should talk to him about
when he gets out.

144
00:14:43,762 --> 00:14:45,821
- Why now?
- What?

145
00:14:46,031 --> 00:14:48,431
Proctor. Why now?

146
00:14:48,834 --> 00:14:50,034
That's why I'm here, isn't it?

147
00:14:50,236 --> 00:14:51,567
I don't know why you're here.

148
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:53,635
I've been trying to
pinpoint in my mind

149
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,759
what it is about you.
Procedure, protocols, laws,

150
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,809
you just don't have patience
for any of it.

151
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,868
Rebecca,

152
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,876
your uncle has had a long run...

153
00:15:02,848 --> 00:15:04,713
But his luck's about to run out.

154
00:15:05,217 --> 00:15:07,417
I don't think that they're gonna
take him down for this,

155
00:15:07,453 --> 00:15:10,445
I know it,
because I'm gonna help them do it.

156
00:15:10,656 --> 00:15:12,351
Why are you telling me this?

157
00:15:14,727 --> 00:15:17,252
It's time for you to make a choice.

158
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,560
Why me?

159
00:15:26,071 --> 00:15:27,629
I like you.

160
00:15:56,769 --> 00:15:59,101
The warrant is specific
to the basement

161
00:15:59,305 --> 00:16:01,865
and excludes any and all other rooms
of the house.

162
00:16:02,074 --> 00:16:04,440
So, it could be argued
that the subbasement

163
00:16:04,643 --> 00:16:06,941
in which the contraband was found

164
00:16:07,146 --> 00:16:09,273
wasn't on the warrant and is,
therefore, inadmissible.

165
00:16:09,481 --> 00:16:11,881
- Would that work?
- 50/50.

166
00:16:12,084 --> 00:16:13,142
Depends on the judge.

167
00:16:13,352 --> 00:16:15,684
And meanwhile,
I'm pushing for a new bail hearing.

168
00:16:15,888 --> 00:16:18,379
The ADA is arguing flight risk.

169
00:16:18,591 --> 00:16:20,791
But all the new ones do that,
so I will push it through.

170
00:16:20,893 --> 00:16:22,520
It'll just take a day or two.

171
00:16:22,728 --> 00:16:23,820
What about Longshadow?

172
00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:25,826
Well,
that's a whole 'nother ball of wax.

173
00:16:26,031 --> 00:16:27,259
You sure he's gonna
go through with it?

174
00:16:27,466 --> 00:16:29,798
He seemed very sure.

175
00:16:30,002 --> 00:16:32,596
Yeah. Well, we'll have to see
what he's got.

176
00:16:32,805 --> 00:16:35,706
Until then, my number one priority
is to get you out of here.

177
00:16:35,908 --> 00:16:38,206
So I will call you
as soon as I have anything new.

178
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:39,434
Thank you.

179
00:16:39,645 --> 00:16:41,704
Rebecca,
I will wait for you outside.

180
00:16:48,287 --> 00:16:49,345
What is it?

181
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:52,917
It never rains, but it pours.

182
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,524
You're worried about Alex?

183
00:16:54,727 --> 00:16:58,925
Well, he picked a hell of a time
to grow some balls.

184
00:17:00,366 --> 00:17:02,857
Well, can't Sperling
do anything about that?

185
00:17:03,068 --> 00:17:04,968
Maybe.

186
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:06,569
Maybe.

187
00:17:07,773 --> 00:17:08,773
Uncle?

188
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:12,436
Just go home, Rebecca.

189
00:17:12,645 --> 00:17:14,203
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

190
00:17:14,413 --> 00:17:15,505
Okay.

191
00:17:26,925 --> 00:17:28,392
You've got another visitor.

192
00:17:42,308 --> 00:17:44,173
Mother.

193
00:17:44,376 --> 00:17:45,843
Hello, Kai.

194
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:02,449
You look tired.

195
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:06,529
I'm not tired.

196
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,095
Just older.

197
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:15,272
Why are you here?

198
00:18:15,474 --> 00:18:18,341
A mother hears her son is alone

199
00:18:18,544 --> 00:18:19,544
and in trouble.

200
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,643
Well...

201
00:18:24,516 --> 00:18:27,849
I've been alone
for many years, Mother...

202
00:18:28,053 --> 00:18:29,850
For my entire adult life.

203
00:18:33,592 --> 00:18:34,786
As have I.

204
00:18:38,797 --> 00:18:40,628
Does my father know you're here?

205
00:18:42,634 --> 00:18:44,659
Your father demands contrition

206
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:47,361
from everyone except himself.

207
00:18:50,075 --> 00:18:52,509
As I get older,

208
00:18:52,711 --> 00:18:55,908
I have far less patience
for arrogance

209
00:18:56,115 --> 00:18:58,174
disguised as righteousness.

210
00:18:59,318 --> 00:19:02,913
- And yet you stay.
- And yet I stay.

211
00:19:05,758 --> 00:19:08,522
I was not raised to think
there was another way.

212
00:19:10,095 --> 00:19:12,393
By the time I came to it on my own,

213
00:19:12,598 --> 00:19:14,759
I was an old lady.

214
00:19:22,141 --> 00:19:24,473
I failed you, Kai.

215
00:19:24,676 --> 00:19:28,840
I let the dogma of small-minded men

216
00:19:29,047 --> 00:19:30,378
determine your fate

217
00:19:30,582 --> 00:19:32,482
when I should have been
protecting you...

218
00:19:33,619 --> 00:19:36,588
The way any other mother
in the world

219
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:38,188
would have protected her young.

220
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:42,156
And now I see you in here,
and I know

221
00:19:42,361 --> 00:19:44,261
that we put you here...

222
00:19:45,063 --> 00:19:47,497
Your father and I.

223
00:19:55,407 --> 00:19:59,343
Your crimes,
whatever they may be,

224
00:19:59,545 --> 00:20:01,570
are my crimes.

225
00:20:19,465 --> 00:20:21,296
May I come see you again?

226
00:20:28,674 --> 00:20:30,073
Yeah.

227
00:20:56,268 --> 00:20:57,997
Can I help you?

228
00:20:58,203 --> 00:21:01,661
Captain Julius Bonner, NYPD.

229
00:21:01,874 --> 00:21:03,637
So you are not here to pray?

230
00:21:03,842 --> 00:21:05,241
No.

231
00:21:05,444 --> 00:21:08,470
Just doing a little legwork
for the FBI.

232
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,309
- Where is Agent Racine?
- They don't seem to know.

233
00:21:12,518 --> 00:21:15,009
Maybe that's why
they asked me to drop by,

234
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,847
to see if maybe you knew.

235
00:21:17,055 --> 00:21:20,286
I haven't seen Agent Racine
in a while.

236
00:21:20,492 --> 00:21:23,120
He was not a healthy man.

237
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:26,058
But he did come in here
from time to time.

238
00:21:26,265 --> 00:21:28,859
Yes. He was looking
for my brother.

239
00:21:29,067 --> 00:21:31,160
I take it you haven't heard from him,
either.

240
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:33,361
If I had,
do you think I would tell you?

241
00:21:33,572 --> 00:21:36,200
No, I guess you wouldn't.

242
00:21:36,408 --> 00:21:38,899
I don't suppose you'd allow me
to search the place.

243
00:21:39,111 --> 00:21:42,410
Yes, of course,
as soon as you show me your warrant.

244
00:21:42,614 --> 00:21:43,876
Why all this interest?

245
00:21:44,082 --> 00:21:46,141
Surely you have more pressing cases.

246
00:21:46,351 --> 00:21:48,012
Oh, yes.

247
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,654
But you never seem to forget
the one that got away.

248
00:21:50,856 --> 00:21:53,950
I almost nailed him
a long time ago.

249
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,957
I picked up this kid
doing a job for him.

250
00:21:57,162 --> 00:21:58,424
Diamonds.

251
00:22:00,332 --> 00:22:01,390
It's for you.

252
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,967
Turns out
it was Rabbit who tipped us off.

253
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:09,163
I tried to turn the kid,
but he was,

254
00:22:09,374 --> 00:22:12,104
you know, committed.

255
00:22:12,311 --> 00:22:16,077
Everyone must live or die
by their own code.

256
00:22:16,782 --> 00:22:18,545
Of course.

257
00:22:21,053 --> 00:22:23,715
Well, you have a good day, Father.

258
00:22:23,922 --> 00:22:25,685
Have a good day.

259
00:22:27,626 --> 00:22:29,389
They're closing in...

260
00:22:29,595 --> 00:22:33,292
The intruder last night,
now this cop.

261
00:22:33,498 --> 00:22:35,159
They will be here soon.

262
00:22:35,367 --> 00:22:38,564
I had hoped to be a bit stronger

263
00:22:38,704 --> 00:22:40,365
when I faced them.

264
00:22:47,212 --> 00:22:50,113
It was a mistake
sending the assassin after them.

265
00:22:50,315 --> 00:22:52,647
We should have waited
until you were healthy.

266
00:22:52,851 --> 00:22:55,149
The only mistake was her failure.

267
00:22:55,354 --> 00:22:56,787
You could not have foreseen that.

268
00:23:06,531 --> 00:23:08,624
- Who the fuck are you
- I'm a nurse, man.

269
00:23:08,834 --> 00:23:10,563
What about this intruder?

270
00:23:10,769 --> 00:23:13,135
He proved more resourceful
than we imagined.

271
00:23:13,338 --> 00:23:15,499
There are only
so many hospitals in the city.

272
00:23:15,707 --> 00:23:16,707
We will find him.

273
00:23:16,908 --> 00:23:19,376
- Which one?
- New York Presbyterian.

274
00:23:19,811 --> 00:23:22,507
- Was I shot?
- No, dude. You got hit by a car.

275
00:23:22,714 --> 00:23:24,443
We have to assume
he will get word to them.

276
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:27,175
He was badly hurt.
He may not get word to anyone.

277
00:23:27,386 --> 00:23:28,512
How long have I been here?

278
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,312
I don't know.
My shift started at noon.

279
00:23:30,522 --> 00:23:32,114
- Are the cops here?
- Why would the cops be here?

280
00:23:32,324 --> 00:23:33,916
I have called everyone in.

281
00:23:34,126 --> 00:23:35,457
We will be ready for them.

282
00:23:35,661 --> 00:23:37,561
Wait, what the hell are you doing?
No, you can't get out of bed.

283
00:23:37,763 --> 00:23:38,752
Tell me where
my fucking clothes are.

284
00:23:38,964 --> 00:23:40,226
You can't go anywhere.

285
00:23:40,432 --> 00:23:42,627
- They're gonna fucking kill me, man.
- No one's gonna kill you.

286
00:23:42,834 --> 00:23:43,801
They're gonna fucking kill me.

287
00:23:44,002 --> 00:23:45,492
You have a serious concussion.
You can't go anywhere.

288
00:23:45,704 --> 00:23:47,228
- The fuck I can't.
- Please just get back in the bed!

289
00:23:47,439 --> 00:23:49,399
- I need some help in here!
- Get the fuck off me!

290
00:23:51,343 --> 00:23:53,811
Hey, sorry to keep you waiting.

291
00:23:54,012 --> 00:23:55,292
It's all right. I just got here.

292
00:23:56,081 --> 00:23:58,106
Hey, Laura,
can I get a cup of coffee?

293
00:24:00,619 --> 00:24:02,644
A few days ago,
that building blew up.

294
00:24:02,854 --> 00:24:05,721
Word is it was an ecstasy lab.

295
00:24:05,924 --> 00:24:06,924
Proctor?

296
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:10,094
Well, not that we can prove,
but, yeah.

297
00:24:10,295 --> 00:24:11,728
Thanks.

298
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:14,160
I've requested a forensics team
from the DEA,

299
00:24:14,366 --> 00:24:16,459
but first they gotta
find us on a map.

300
00:24:17,836 --> 00:24:19,997
So I'm guessing
this is not a defective gas line.

301
00:24:20,205 --> 00:24:23,470
Mm-mm, truck went through a wall
and then the place went sky-high.

302
00:24:27,212 --> 00:24:29,092
Is that it?
I mean, why are you showing me this?

303
00:24:29,114 --> 00:24:30,274
Because the day before this happened,

304
00:24:30,482 --> 00:24:32,922
I was out there with Hood and Emmett.
We shook down some guys.

305
00:24:33,051 --> 00:24:34,541
We found out this is where
they're making the drugs.

306
00:24:34,753 --> 00:24:36,880
And Hood desperately
wanted to tie it to Proctor,

307
00:24:37,089 --> 00:24:38,147
but we couldn't.

308
00:24:38,356 --> 00:24:40,324
And then it blows up.

309
00:24:40,525 --> 00:24:41,549
Just like that.

310
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,988
And then he busts Proctor
on a warrant

311
00:24:43,195 --> 00:24:45,686
based on information
from a confidential informant.

312
00:24:45,897 --> 00:24:49,264
Exactly. And I wouldn't bet
the farm on that warrant.

313
00:24:49,468 --> 00:24:50,696
Shit.

314
00:24:52,904 --> 00:24:55,099
What the hell is he up to?

315
00:25:02,981 --> 00:25:04,175
George.

316
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,778
Long day?

317
00:25:07,853 --> 00:25:09,878
The only kind I seem to
be having these days.

318
00:25:10,088 --> 00:25:11,088
Drink?

319
00:25:14,392 --> 00:25:18,158
That was some stunt
you pulled with the council.

320
00:25:18,363 --> 00:25:21,730
Oh, George, don't be a sore loser.

321
00:25:21,933 --> 00:25:23,628
Men voted their consciences.

322
00:25:25,003 --> 00:25:26,402
Well, I'm sure you've heard

323
00:25:26,538 --> 00:25:27,903
that your good friend Proctor

324
00:25:28,006 --> 00:25:30,338
has once again been incarcerated.

325
00:25:31,643 --> 00:25:34,077
Proctor's no friend of mine.

326
00:25:34,446 --> 00:25:36,141
As a matter of fact,
I'm taking measures to make sure

327
00:25:36,348 --> 00:25:37,906
he goes down for the count.

328
00:25:41,086 --> 00:25:43,850
Maybe I underestimated you.

329
00:25:45,624 --> 00:25:49,993
But maybe you underestimated me, too.

330
00:25:56,067 --> 00:25:58,058
This dagger

331
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:00,795
belonged to my great-grandfather.

332
00:26:01,306 --> 00:26:03,399
It's handed down as a totem

333
00:26:03,608 --> 00:26:06,839
to the first-born male
of each generation

334
00:26:07,045 --> 00:26:09,013
when he comes of age.

335
00:26:09,214 --> 00:26:11,808
So far, every man in my family

336
00:26:12,017 --> 00:26:14,076
who has carried this knife

337
00:26:14,286 --> 00:26:16,311
has had occasion to use it.

338
00:26:16,521 --> 00:26:19,957
Of course, I have no sons.

339
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:28,099
Is this your occasion, George?

340
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,858
Is that why you're here?

341
00:26:36,241 --> 00:26:37,640
I didn't think so.

342
00:27:00,232 --> 00:27:02,530
It's hard to know
when I realized it.

343
00:27:03,802 --> 00:27:06,566
Little girls love their fathers.

344
00:27:06,771 --> 00:27:08,796
And mine was so loving,

345
00:27:09,007 --> 00:27:10,304
so attentive.

346
00:27:11,343 --> 00:27:13,334
And he kept me in this little world,

347
00:27:13,478 --> 00:27:16,879
and I had no other reality
to compare it to.

348
00:27:20,552 --> 00:27:22,281
So what changed?

349
00:27:22,487 --> 00:27:24,045
Kids in school.

350
00:27:25,423 --> 00:27:27,823
They started to tease me.

351
00:27:28,026 --> 00:27:30,119
And you know how kids can be.

352
00:27:32,898 --> 00:27:35,366
Then this one day,
I was walking home from school...

353
00:27:36,301 --> 00:27:38,098
And I passed by a newsstand.

354
00:27:39,804 --> 00:27:43,740
And my father's picture
was on the front page of every paper.

355
00:27:45,343 --> 00:27:47,470
So I bought a copy and I read it.

356
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,439
And I didn't understand much,
I was about 11,

357
00:27:49,447 --> 00:27:51,278
but I understood enough.

358
00:27:52,784 --> 00:27:55,617
They were saying that my father
had had people killed.

359
00:27:57,322 --> 00:28:00,052
So I took the paper
and I put it on his pillow...

360
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:01,959
And I went to sleep.

361
00:28:03,328 --> 00:28:05,421
And then the next morning,
he was sitting in my room

362
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:08,030
in an old rocking chair
I had in the corner,

363
00:28:08,233 --> 00:28:10,030
just rocking back and forth,

364
00:28:10,235 --> 00:28:11,964
staring at me.

365
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:14,604
And for the first time in my life,
I was scared of him.

366
00:28:14,806 --> 00:28:16,774
Jesus, Carrie.

367
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,008
But then he picked me up...

368
00:28:24,449 --> 00:28:26,815
Put me in his lap,
and I was barely awake...

369
00:28:30,355 --> 00:28:32,289
Kissed me on my head,

370
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:34,481
and just rocked me back and forth

371
00:28:34,693 --> 00:28:36,684
and I almost fell asleep again.

372
00:28:42,367 --> 00:28:44,267
He was my daddy.

373
00:28:45,337 --> 00:28:46,429
Hey.

374
00:28:50,008 --> 00:28:51,008
That's enough.

375
00:28:51,109 --> 00:28:53,509
You'll have plenty of time
to tell me the rest of it.

376
00:28:55,313 --> 00:28:59,249
- Yeah, I should get going.
- No, no, no. Shh.

377
00:28:59,451 --> 00:29:00,645
No.

378
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,853
No, you shouldn't.

379
00:29:14,032 --> 00:29:15,693
You okay?

380
00:29:18,503 --> 00:29:21,597
Yeah. I'm just thinking about Emmett.

381
00:29:22,974 --> 00:29:23,998
Yeah.

382
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:27,508
I just can't believe
he lost it like that.

383
00:29:31,416 --> 00:29:33,008
Well, I don't think he did lose it.

384
00:29:33,218 --> 00:29:35,186
I think he made a conscious choice.

385
00:29:36,321 --> 00:29:37,913
They hurt his family...

386
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:41,215
- He needed to make 'em pay.
- We would have made them pay.

387
00:29:41,426 --> 00:29:43,894
Yeah, but he needed it
to come from him.

388
00:29:44,095 --> 00:29:46,222
Think of it like you and Breece.

389
00:29:46,431 --> 00:29:48,626
Look, there is a point at which

390
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:51,563
any one of us will do
exactly what Emmett did.

391
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:54,068
It's just a question
of what puts us in that situation

392
00:29:54,239 --> 00:29:58,369
where the circumstances
outweigh the consequences.

393
00:29:58,576 --> 00:29:59,804
We go to the Cadi every day

394
00:30:00,011 --> 00:30:01,501
and we're supposed to be
dealing in justice,

395
00:30:01,713 --> 00:30:02,839
but...

396
00:30:04,082 --> 00:30:06,607
All we're really doing
is enforcing a set of rules.

397
00:30:07,685 --> 00:30:09,016
But justice,

398
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,085
real justice...

399
00:30:11,289 --> 00:30:12,916
Is personal.

400
00:30:15,093 --> 00:30:17,061
Sometimes the only way to get it

401
00:30:17,262 --> 00:30:18,729
is with your own two hands.

402
00:30:19,764 --> 00:30:22,084
You scare the shit out of me
when you say things like that.

403
00:30:22,233 --> 00:30:24,224
You're the one that wanted me
to talk more.

404
00:30:24,436 --> 00:30:26,961
Yeah, I'm starting to
have second thoughts.

405
00:30:34,312 --> 00:30:36,974
You're the only sheriff
that doesn't answer his phone.

406
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:42,519
What?

407
00:30:42,687 --> 00:30:44,484
You need to get your ass
to New York now.

408
00:30:44,689 --> 00:30:45,747
Job?

409
00:30:45,957 --> 00:30:47,424
I'm in deep shit here, man.

410
00:30:47,625 --> 00:30:49,388
Whoa, slow down, slow down.
Where are you?

411
00:30:49,594 --> 00:30:50,822
In the hospital is where I am.

412
00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:52,792
New York Presbyterian, room 307.

413
00:30:52,997 --> 00:30:54,123
And if Rabbit get here first,
I'll be...

414
00:30:54,332 --> 00:30:55,890
You found him?

415
00:30:57,035 --> 00:30:58,502
Yeah, I found him.

416
00:31:00,371 --> 00:31:01,702
Now he gonna find me.

417
00:31:01,906 --> 00:31:03,567
I'm on my way.

418
00:31:04,109 --> 00:31:06,669
- What? What's wrong?
- I have to go.

419
00:31:07,112 --> 00:31:08,807
What, just like that?

420
00:31:09,581 --> 00:31:11,549
You don't think I'm entitled to
more of an explanation than that?

421
00:31:11,716 --> 00:31:15,447
Yeah, you are,
but right now I just don't have time.

422
00:31:15,653 --> 00:31:17,484
Well, are you coming back?

423
00:31:18,857 --> 00:31:20,791
- Not tonight.
- How about ever?

424
00:31:24,229 --> 00:31:25,457
I don't know.

425
00:31:25,663 --> 00:31:28,029
- Then don't go.
- I have to.

426
00:31:31,569 --> 00:31:33,009
I don't think I can do this anymore.

427
00:31:33,104 --> 00:31:35,436
I mean,
I don't even know who you are.

428
00:31:39,043 --> 00:31:40,567
I know.

429
00:31:43,948 --> 00:31:45,245
I'm sorry.

430
00:32:03,334 --> 00:32:04,961
Hello, Brock.

431
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:07,263
Shit. Sorry about that.

432
00:32:07,672 --> 00:32:09,936
- It's fine.
- Wasn't expecting anyone, clearly.

433
00:32:10,141 --> 00:32:11,472
Don't worry about it.

434
00:32:11,676 --> 00:32:14,167
What the hell are you doing here?
I got the night shift.

435
00:32:14,379 --> 00:32:15,710
I have to leave town tonight.

436
00:32:15,914 --> 00:32:17,814
- Where are you going?
- It's not important.

437
00:32:18,016 --> 00:32:19,677
- For how long?
- I don't know.

438
00:32:24,422 --> 00:32:25,514
You're in charge.

439
00:32:25,723 --> 00:32:28,317
Yeah, because that worked out
so well last time.

440
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:33,729
Hood.

441
00:32:37,202 --> 00:32:38,692
Who the hell are you?

442
00:32:43,007 --> 00:32:45,737
You're a good man, Brock.
Take care.

443
00:33:18,943 --> 00:33:20,205
Are you expecting anyone?

444
00:33:21,479 --> 00:33:23,208
It's okay. I got it.

445
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:27,111
Are you expecting somebody?

446
00:33:36,327 --> 00:33:37,447
Hood, what the hell is this?

447
00:33:37,629 --> 00:33:39,221
- Carrie here?
- Are you serious?

448
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:40,692
If she's here,
I need to see her now.

449
00:33:40,832 --> 00:33:42,493
- Go fuck yourself.
- Gordon, it's okay.

450
00:33:42,634 --> 00:33:44,829
- Yeah, the hell it is.
- What is it?

451
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:49,201
- What?
- Job found Rabbit.

452
00:33:49,407 --> 00:33:52,001
- Oh, my God. Where?
- New York.

453
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:53,536
Job's hurt. I'm going now.

454
00:33:53,745 --> 00:33:54,871
- I'm coming.
- What?

455
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:56,679
- Give us a minute.
- We have to go, now.

456
00:33:56,714 --> 00:33:59,274
Give us a minute.
Gordon, honey...

457
00:33:59,484 --> 00:34:01,444
Look, this is your first night
back in this house.

458
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,714
- I know, but if Rabbit's in New York
- None of this shit makes any sense.

459
00:34:03,921 --> 00:34:05,411
I know it doesn't.

460
00:34:05,923 --> 00:34:08,391
But I have to do this,
to protect us, to protect our family.

461
00:34:08,593 --> 00:34:10,584
- If we're gonna have a chance...
- And how are we gonna have a chance

462
00:34:10,795 --> 00:34:12,490
when he keeps showing up here?
What is it with you?

463
00:34:12,697 --> 00:34:14,255
Why is any of this your problem?

464
00:34:14,465 --> 00:34:15,989
Don't look at her,
I'm the one talking to you.

465
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,134
I don't have time for this shit.
You can stay here if you want.

466
00:34:18,336 --> 00:34:20,256
- I gotta go.
- Hey, stop fucking talking to her.

467
00:34:20,571 --> 00:34:22,611
- Don't you turn your back on me.
- Gordon, stop it!

468
00:34:22,674 --> 00:34:25,006
- Fuck you!
- Jesus Christ!

469
00:34:25,209 --> 00:34:26,801
Now, how many times
are you gonna ruin our lives?

470
00:34:27,011 --> 00:34:29,138
- This has nothing to do with you.
- Gordon, put the gun down.

471
00:34:29,347 --> 00:34:31,507
- You don't understand.
- What, are you protecting him?

472
00:34:31,649 --> 00:34:32,809
- No.
- What the hell is this?

473
00:34:32,984 --> 00:34:34,624
Are you fucking him?
Is that what this is?

474
00:34:34,819 --> 00:34:36,582
- No, it isn't.
- Then what the hell is it, then?!

475
00:34:36,754 --> 00:34:38,449
If he doesn't get that gun
out of my fucking face,

476
00:34:38,656 --> 00:34:39,680
- I'm gonna fuckin' kill him.
- Stop it.

477
00:34:39,891 --> 00:34:41,051
You're gonna kill me?
I don't think so.

478
00:34:41,259 --> 00:34:42,226
I don't give a fuck what you think.

479
00:34:42,427 --> 00:34:43,427
You show up at my house

480
00:34:43,594 --> 00:34:45,084
- looking for my wife...
- You don't know what's going on,

481
00:34:45,196 --> 00:34:46,857
- so back off!
- I will blow your fucking head off!

482
00:34:47,065 --> 00:34:49,932
- Last chance!
- He's Deva's father!

483
00:35:17,528 --> 00:35:18,586
What?

484
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,597
What did you say?

485
00:35:27,038 --> 00:35:28,403
Gordon...

486
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,919
Gordon?

487
00:35:48,426 --> 00:35:50,690
I will tell you everything.

488
00:35:53,765 --> 00:35:55,596
But right now I have to go.

489
00:35:57,969 --> 00:35:59,266
I have to go.

490
00:36:00,705 --> 00:36:02,036
Why?

491
00:36:02,407 --> 00:36:05,103
Because I have to kill him.

492
00:36:05,309 --> 00:36:07,038
Or die trying.

493
00:36:17,922 --> 00:36:20,652
I meant what I said.
Either he dies or we do.

494
00:36:20,858 --> 00:36:22,086
Nothing less.

495
00:36:24,562 --> 00:36:25,995
I couldn't agree more.

496
00:39:35,486 --> 00:39:37,113
Is that any way
to greet an old friend?

497
00:39:37,321 --> 00:39:39,084
- Asshole.
- Can you move?

498
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:41,986
- Barely.
- Come on, let's get you...

499
00:40:02,947 --> 00:40:04,244
Oh! Fuck!

500
00:40:42,219 --> 00:40:43,584
Shots fired on the third floor.

501
00:40:43,788 --> 00:40:46,586
Request police backup.
Drop your weapon!

502
00:41:47,685 --> 00:41:49,118
Help!

503
00:41:50,521 --> 00:41:53,854
Drop it! Drop the gun now.

504
00:41:54,058 --> 00:41:56,652
Come out and drop the gun now.

505
00:42:24,021 --> 00:42:25,249
I'll kill her.

506
00:42:27,091 --> 00:42:28,091
No, you won't.

507
00:42:40,671 --> 00:42:42,434
What took you so long?

508
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,574
- He had a friend.
- How about a little less talk

509
00:42:44,775 --> 00:42:46,615
and a little more
getting the fuck out of here?

510
00:42:48,145 --> 00:42:49,145
Shit.

511
00:42:49,346 --> 00:42:50,540
Let's move.

512
00:42:55,719 --> 00:42:58,119
I want men in all four stairwells.

513
00:42:58,322 --> 00:43:01,553
And be careful. The shooter
might still be in the building.

514
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:03,454
You two, with me.

515
00:43:06,764 --> 00:43:08,595
I want you to head down there,
make a loop.

516
00:43:08,799 --> 00:43:10,562
We'll meet back up at ICU.

517
00:43:22,446 --> 00:43:24,846
Son of a bitch!
Move, move, move!

518
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,460
So what the hell were you thinking,

519
00:43:38,662 --> 00:43:40,220
trying to take him out on your own?

520
00:43:40,431 --> 00:43:42,695
I saw an opening and I took it.

521
00:43:43,801 --> 00:43:45,201
Would have finished him right there

522
00:43:45,236 --> 00:43:47,295
if it hadn't been
for that psycho priest.

523
00:43:47,504 --> 00:43:49,301
- Priest?
- Yulish.

524
00:43:49,506 --> 00:43:51,303
- What, you know him?
- He's my uncle.

525
00:43:51,508 --> 00:43:54,375
I never met him,
but my father used to talk about him.

526
00:43:55,246 --> 00:43:57,737
I always got the feeling
that he was scared of him.

527
00:43:57,948 --> 00:43:59,381
Are there any members
of your family

528
00:43:59,583 --> 00:44:01,710
who aren't homicidal maniacs?

529
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:03,716
- We'll go in tomorrow.
- I know the layout.

530
00:44:03,921 --> 00:44:06,947
- I should come with you.
- You can't even stand, Job.

531
00:44:07,157 --> 00:44:10,524
It's just a concussion, man.
You get them every day.

532
00:44:10,728 --> 00:44:12,992
The inside of your head
must look like a Jackson Pollock.

533
00:44:13,197 --> 00:44:15,392
Can't have you slowing us down, okay?

534
00:44:18,135 --> 00:44:20,228
It's not exactly an arsenal.

535
00:44:20,437 --> 00:44:22,667
Yeah, we had to leave
in a bit of a hurry.

536
00:44:24,174 --> 00:44:26,870
Hey, Pony still dealing guns
in these parts?

537
00:44:27,077 --> 00:44:29,773
Only dealing Pony's doing
is blowjobs in Sing Sing.

538
00:44:33,117 --> 00:44:35,210
But you know who is still around?

539
00:44:36,921 --> 00:44:37,945
You think?

540
00:44:38,155 --> 00:44:40,282
I'd have heard
if someone took him out.

541
00:44:40,491 --> 00:44:41,924
Who?

542
00:44:42,126 --> 00:44:43,320
An old friend.

543
00:44:43,527 --> 00:44:47,520
He's using a very liberal definition
of the word friend.

544
00:44:48,198 --> 00:44:49,198
Think he'd remember me?

545
00:44:49,366 --> 00:44:51,266
The question is,
do you want him to?

546
00:45:06,383 --> 00:45:08,214
Your men?

547
00:45:08,419 --> 00:45:10,387
They are dead.

548
00:45:13,424 --> 00:45:15,654
Then they have come.

549
00:45:15,859 --> 00:45:17,087
Yes.

550
00:45:18,295 --> 00:45:20,661
I spent 15 years

551
00:45:20,864 --> 00:45:22,627
searching for my daughter.

552
00:45:22,833 --> 00:45:25,427
And now she hunts me.

553
00:45:30,874 --> 00:45:32,705
Tell me, Yulish.

554
00:45:34,144 --> 00:45:36,408
Do you really believe in God?

555
00:45:37,848 --> 00:45:40,112
I do, yes.

556
00:45:41,485 --> 00:45:42,679
To me...

557
00:45:43,921 --> 00:45:47,982
God always felt
like something men made up

558
00:45:48,192 --> 00:45:50,820
to feel less alone.

559
00:45:54,231 --> 00:45:55,994
And now...

560
00:45:58,602 --> 00:46:02,094
I am more alone
than I have ever been.

561
00:46:05,075 --> 00:46:06,702
I don't trust you.

562
00:46:08,412 --> 00:46:09,936
I don't give a shit.

563
00:46:12,549 --> 00:46:14,949
And instead of wishing for God...

564
00:46:16,787 --> 00:46:18,812
I am praying...

565
00:46:20,324 --> 00:46:22,349
That He does not exist.

566
00:46:25,863 --> 00:46:27,421
Because if He does...

567
00:46:29,233 --> 00:46:31,258
Dead or alive...

568
00:46:34,304 --> 00:46:37,068
There will be no peace for me.

569
00:46:40,444 --> 00:46:43,971
My sins will follow me
beyond the grave.
