1
00:00:10,608 --> 00:00:12,667
I'm not Ana anymore.
My name is Carrie.

2
00:00:12,877 --> 00:00:14,811
Is anything about us true?
About you?

3
00:00:15,012 --> 00:00:17,640
Is Carrie even your real name?

4
00:00:17,849 --> 00:00:20,409
Your mother has told you
many lies, Deva.

5
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,917
- We have two children
- Max!

6
00:00:24,122 --> 00:00:26,522
Whose lives have been
turned upside down.

7
00:00:26,724 --> 00:00:29,750
- My baby!
- And nothing and no one else

8
00:00:29,961 --> 00:00:31,690
is more important than that.

9
00:00:36,467 --> 00:00:37,900
You got a visitor.

10
00:00:41,172 --> 00:00:42,434
You coming?

11
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,452
Making friends?

12
00:01:04,662 --> 00:01:05,720
You know me.

13
00:01:06,998 --> 00:01:08,625
You getting any more time for it?

14
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:10,425
They just let me off
with a warning.

15
00:01:10,635 --> 00:01:12,660
Take it seriously.

16
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,565
They'll just keep you
in here longer.

17
00:01:14,772 --> 00:01:17,502
I just can't stand
being in here,

18
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:19,175
not knowing if my kids are okay.

19
00:01:19,377 --> 00:01:20,571
I can't talk to them.

20
00:01:20,778 --> 00:01:22,939
- And then if he comes back...
- Rabbit?

21
00:01:24,348 --> 00:01:26,908
If he's alive,

22
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:28,380
you hurt him pretty badly.

23
00:01:30,254 --> 00:01:31,414
He's alive.

24
00:01:34,392 --> 00:01:36,883
I put my kids in harm's way.

25
00:01:37,094 --> 00:01:39,289
I have to get them out of it.

26
00:01:39,497 --> 00:01:40,497
We will.

27
00:01:48,372 --> 00:01:49,498
Hey.

28
00:01:51,475 --> 00:01:54,239
All that time you were inside,

29
00:01:54,445 --> 00:01:56,003
I never came to see you.

30
00:01:59,183 --> 00:02:00,377
Thank you.

31
00:02:11,796 --> 00:02:13,525
Just keep your head down, okay?

32
00:02:14,899 --> 00:02:16,992
- Quiet time.
- Quiet time.

33
00:05:10,841 --> 00:05:13,537
My grandfather says
green eyes are a sign of the devil.

34
00:05:16,814 --> 00:05:18,281
Maybe he's right.

35
00:05:19,884 --> 00:05:21,249
I put that in the category

36
00:05:21,452 --> 00:05:23,716
of crazy shit old Injuns believe.

37
00:05:26,157 --> 00:05:27,681
What?

38
00:05:27,892 --> 00:05:29,189
Was it the shit part

39
00:05:29,393 --> 00:05:31,258
or the Injun part that got you?

40
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,098
Sometimes I wonder
what planet you come from.

41
00:05:35,299 --> 00:05:37,233
And the Lord God said,

42
00:05:37,435 --> 00:05:39,426
"It is not good that man
should be alone.

43
00:05:41,172 --> 00:05:44,335
I will make him
a helpmate for him."

44
00:05:44,542 --> 00:05:46,567
And out of the ground,
the Lord God

45
00:05:46,777 --> 00:05:48,574
formed every beast of the field

46
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:51,213
and every fowl of the air.

47
00:05:52,983 --> 00:05:54,814
Want a bite?

48
00:05:58,756 --> 00:06:00,519
We have got to get out of here.

49
00:06:00,724 --> 00:06:01,782
Right now?

50
00:06:01,992 --> 00:06:03,983
No, not right now.

51
00:06:04,195 --> 00:06:06,060
The first chance I get, I'm gone.

52
00:06:06,263 --> 00:06:08,322
Is it really that bad
on the reservation?

53
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,569
Our parents tell us how we were
this great warrior tribe,

54
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,237
but now everyone's on drugs

55
00:06:14,438 --> 00:06:16,133
or in jail or getting killed.

56
00:06:18,275 --> 00:06:20,300
I'm not gonna die on the rez.

57
00:06:22,113 --> 00:06:23,113
No way.

58
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,406
Where would you go?

59
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:27,080
I don't know.

60
00:06:28,352 --> 00:06:29,842
It's a big world out there.

61
00:06:30,054 --> 00:06:33,148
And whatsoever Adam called
every living creature,

62
00:06:33,357 --> 00:06:35,291
that was the name thereon.

63
00:06:35,493 --> 00:06:37,654
You miss Rebecca, don't you?

64
00:06:38,896 --> 00:06:41,023
And the Lord God
caused a deep sleep

65
00:06:41,232 --> 00:06:42,597
to fall upon Adam

66
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,199
and he slept.

67
00:06:44,401 --> 00:06:46,266
And he took one of his ribs

68
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:48,461
and closed up the flesh

69
00:06:48,672 --> 00:06:50,435
instead thereof.

70
00:06:50,641 --> 00:06:52,336
Is that what you want to become?

71
00:06:52,543 --> 00:06:55,910
Are you gonna drive a horse
and buggy, grow a long beard,

72
00:06:56,113 --> 00:06:58,604
and throw your children
on the streets when they tell you to?

73
00:07:01,585 --> 00:07:02,779
And the rib,

74
00:07:02,987 --> 00:07:05,353
which the Lord God
had taken from man,

75
00:07:05,556 --> 00:07:06,853
made He a woman

76
00:07:08,025 --> 00:07:10,994
and brought her unto the man.

77
00:07:12,763 --> 00:07:15,994
You know, we could go together.

78
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,792
If you want.

79
00:07:58,676 --> 00:08:00,974
- I'm going to get the horse.
- I'll stay here.

80
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,323
Solomon?

81
00:08:16,026 --> 00:08:17,493
Solomon.

82
00:08:19,063 --> 00:08:20,291
Solomon.

83
00:08:34,411 --> 00:08:36,140
Solomon!

84
00:08:38,983 --> 00:08:41,577
Solomon!

85
00:08:41,785 --> 00:08:43,275
Solomon!

86
00:08:46,457 --> 00:08:48,084
Solomon!

87
00:09:35,306 --> 00:09:37,399
Her name is Lana Cleary.

88
00:09:37,608 --> 00:09:38,802
She's Kinaho.

89
00:09:40,744 --> 00:09:42,871
- What's she doing here?
- No idea.

90
00:09:46,817 --> 00:09:49,411
Don't we have
a medical examiner for that?

91
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,820
Three counties sharing one ME,

92
00:09:50,988 --> 00:09:53,013
we tend not to be a priority.

93
00:09:53,223 --> 00:09:55,063
After last night's rain,
there isn't much left,

94
00:09:55,225 --> 00:09:56,692
but we take the pictures,

95
00:09:56,894 --> 00:09:59,954
send it all up to Harrisburg
for forensic analysis.

96
00:10:00,164 --> 00:10:02,860
I don't need Harrisburg to tell me
she got her skull caved in.

97
00:10:03,067 --> 00:10:04,398
Hey, that's the girl's
family over there.

98
00:10:04,601 --> 00:10:05,801
You might want to talk to them.

99
00:10:05,836 --> 00:10:08,396
They're pretty broken up.
I couldn't get any information.

100
00:10:08,605 --> 00:10:09,725
Mr. Bowman,
please stay back.

101
00:10:09,773 --> 00:10:10,773
- Sheriff.
- Mr. Bowman.

102
00:10:10,941 --> 00:10:14,604
My son Solomon,
he never came home last night.

103
00:10:14,812 --> 00:10:16,746
Whoever did this might have done
the same thing to him.

104
00:10:16,947 --> 00:10:19,643
All right, Mr. Bowman, I assure you
every effort will be made.

105
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:22,341
But you can help us by asking your
people who saw Solomon last.

106
00:10:22,553 --> 00:10:23,713
- Okay?
- I don't know.

107
00:10:23,921 --> 00:10:25,320
All right, thank you.
I understand.

108
00:10:25,522 --> 00:10:28,047
Right now I need you
to please step back.

109
00:10:29,293 --> 00:10:30,817
- There's no connection?
- No.

110
00:10:32,796 --> 00:10:33,796
Tell him.

111
00:10:33,964 --> 00:10:36,023
Just tell him what you told me.

112
00:10:36,233 --> 00:10:37,825
Now, come on. Now.

113
00:10:39,036 --> 00:10:42,096
Lana was hooking up
with an Amish kid.

114
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,448
What Amish kid?
What's his name?

115
00:10:45,542 --> 00:10:47,533
Solomon Bowman.

116
00:10:47,745 --> 00:10:49,042
What?

117
00:10:49,246 --> 00:10:51,111
This is... this is a... this is a lie.

118
00:10:51,315 --> 00:10:52,873
This is a damned lie.

119
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,449
My son had no dealings
with Indian girls.

120
00:10:55,652 --> 00:10:57,711
- So where is the boy?
- He's not here.

121
00:10:57,921 --> 00:10:59,354
He's missing.
The boy is missing.

122
00:10:59,556 --> 00:11:01,751
They're hiding the boy.
You're hiding the boy!

123
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:03,984
Why do you say this?
I am not hiding him.

124
00:11:04,194 --> 00:11:06,788
He's hiding the boy.
Bring the boy here.

125
00:11:06,997 --> 00:11:09,522
I will not bring the boy here.
He has nothing to answer for.

126
00:11:09,733 --> 00:11:11,564
- He killed her.
- Why does he say this?

127
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:14,431
Both of you just back off now!

128
00:11:15,806 --> 00:11:17,671
- If you're hiding him...
- What? No. What?

129
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,502
- I do not know where he is.
- He killed my baby!

130
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:22,270
I tell you he did not
kill anyone.

131
00:11:22,479 --> 00:11:24,208
He killed her!

132
00:11:24,415 --> 00:11:25,507
He killed my baby!

133
00:11:25,716 --> 00:11:26,740
Mr. Cleary.

134
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:29,316
Mr. Cleary. Mr. Cleary.

135
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,040
- Mr. Cleary.
- Please stay back, okay?

136
00:11:31,188 --> 00:11:32,985
I have to find my son.

137
00:11:48,071 --> 00:11:50,111
The state is sending more
troopers to comb the area.

138
00:11:50,207 --> 00:11:51,469
Okay.

139
00:11:52,843 --> 00:11:53,935
Thanks.

140
00:11:58,849 --> 00:12:01,545
Hey, who's the big guy?

141
00:12:03,754 --> 00:12:06,723
Oh, that's Chayton.

142
00:12:06,924 --> 00:12:09,893
He's head of the Redbones,
a gang on the reservation.

143
00:12:10,093 --> 00:12:11,924
Real bad news.

144
00:12:12,129 --> 00:12:13,926
Did some time a while back.

145
00:12:14,131 --> 00:12:16,051
Beat the living shit
out of a busload of tourists

146
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:17,793
because some of them
were dressed like Indians.

147
00:12:18,001 --> 00:12:19,881
Came out bigger and meaner
than when he went in.

148
00:12:19,937 --> 00:12:22,098
You guys bust him?

149
00:12:22,306 --> 00:12:23,830
No, staties got him.

150
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:25,841
Me and Brock tried
to arrest him a while back.

151
00:12:25,976 --> 00:12:28,035
- You tried?
- He's a large man.

152
00:12:31,982 --> 00:12:33,142
Siobhan.

153
00:12:44,728 --> 00:12:46,355
Keep your finger
along the trigger guard

154
00:12:46,563 --> 00:12:48,224
until you're ready to shoot.

155
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,464
Good.
Wide stance.

156
00:12:52,669 --> 00:12:53,795
Good.

157
00:12:54,004 --> 00:12:56,097
Good. Now let's see
what you can do.

158
00:12:59,943 --> 00:13:01,570
That's very good.

159
00:13:04,181 --> 00:13:05,478
Excuse me.

160
00:13:16,894 --> 00:13:18,452
Solomon?

161
00:13:24,268 --> 00:13:26,498
Solomon! Solomon!

162
00:13:26,703 --> 00:13:28,136
Solomon!

163
00:13:29,773 --> 00:13:33,300
- Solomon!
- Solomon, can you hear me?

164
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,636
Solomon!

165
00:13:40,784 --> 00:13:43,446
- Solomon!
- Solomon!

166
00:13:43,654 --> 00:13:44,916
Solomon!

167
00:14:19,289 --> 00:14:21,723
Hold on a moment, okay?

168
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:32,135
- Yeah?
- Sheriff.

169
00:14:32,336 --> 00:14:34,361
Have you heard anything
about my brother?

170
00:14:34,571 --> 00:14:36,038
Uh, no. Not yet.

171
00:14:36,239 --> 00:14:39,572
State troopers are helping with
the search, but there's nothing yet.

172
00:14:41,144 --> 00:14:43,009
Do you have any idea
where he might be?

173
00:14:43,213 --> 00:14:45,204
Solomon's not a killer.

174
00:14:45,415 --> 00:14:47,315
There's a lot of people
who believe he is.

175
00:14:47,517 --> 00:14:50,213
That's why we need to find him
before the Kinaho do.

176
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:53,548
If I can be of any help,
Sheriff, any help at all.

177
00:14:53,757 --> 00:14:56,157
Yeah, I'll keep that in mind.

178
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,486
Good.

179
00:14:58,895 --> 00:15:01,830
Let's go, Rebecca.
Let the sheriff do his job.

180
00:15:02,032 --> 00:15:03,260
Come on.

181
00:15:10,107 --> 00:15:11,870
Please.

182
00:15:12,075 --> 00:15:13,906
Just bring him back to me.

183
00:15:24,821 --> 00:15:26,254
Rebecca Bowman
have anything to add?

184
00:15:26,456 --> 00:15:27,582
No.

185
00:15:28,859 --> 00:15:30,588
I think I got something
from the sister.

186
00:15:30,794 --> 00:15:33,729
Lana Cleary had an ex-boyfriend,
a guy named Tommy Littlestone.

187
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,864
Apparently, when he found out
she was dating an Amish kid,

188
00:15:36,066 --> 00:15:37,066
he went off on her.

189
00:15:37,234 --> 00:15:38,794
Started sending her threatening
e-mails.

190
00:15:38,835 --> 00:15:40,995
Tommy Littlestone?
Any relation to Chayton Littlestone?

191
00:15:41,138 --> 00:15:42,105
Yeah, it's his little brother.

192
00:15:42,305 --> 00:15:44,637
What, Chayton, the big guy
from the crime scene?

193
00:15:44,841 --> 00:15:47,105
Yeah. Chayton isn't some
meathead gangbanger.

194
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,310
He's old school.

195
00:15:48,478 --> 00:15:50,446
He's all about the purity
of the Kinaho tribe.

196
00:15:50,647 --> 00:15:52,842
In fact, none of the Redbones
date outside the tribe.

197
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:55,314
So my guess is if his little
brother's girl was involved

198
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:56,713
with some Amish boy,

199
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,360
that wouldn't have
gone over so well.

200
00:15:58,388 --> 00:15:59,912
Yeah, and according
to Lana's sister,

201
00:16:00,123 --> 00:16:02,284
Tommy's now a full-fledged member
of the Redbones.

202
00:16:02,492 --> 00:16:05,427
I guess we need to have a little chat
with Tommy Littlestone.

203
00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:07,620
We have no jurisdiction
on the reservation.

204
00:16:07,831 --> 00:16:10,431
We cannot take one step onto
their land without a federal warrant.

205
00:16:10,567 --> 00:16:12,159
Exactly.

206
00:16:13,203 --> 00:16:15,228
- What?
- Nothing.

207
00:16:15,439 --> 00:16:16,736
Just wondering which one of us

208
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,033
has the best relationship
with the FBI these days.

209
00:16:22,913 --> 00:16:25,677
That's what I thought.
Let's go.

210
00:16:25,882 --> 00:16:27,611
What?
Hood. Hood.

211
00:16:27,818 --> 00:16:29,012
Hey!

212
00:17:24,608 --> 00:17:25,973
We should rethink this.

213
00:17:26,176 --> 00:17:27,643
I agree.

214
00:17:27,844 --> 00:17:28,970
We expecting trouble?

215
00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:31,374
We don't have jurisdiction
here, all right?

216
00:17:31,581 --> 00:17:32,781
Some of these kids are minors.

217
00:17:32,983 --> 00:17:35,315
We pull our guns,
we could all go down for it.

218
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:38,249
- Okay, so no guns.
- Yeah, but if Chayton is in there...

219
00:17:38,455 --> 00:17:40,015
We should probably
have a talk with him.

220
00:17:41,191 --> 00:17:43,125
Where's he going?
Where are you going?

221
00:17:43,326 --> 00:17:45,521
I'm gonna go around back,
poke around a little.

222
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,222
Okay.

223
00:17:49,699 --> 00:17:51,462
He's gonna poke around.

224
00:17:51,668 --> 00:17:53,533
Bring your Tasers.

225
00:17:53,737 --> 00:17:54,737
Shit.

226
00:18:13,657 --> 00:18:15,784
Heads up, guys.
There's cops.

227
00:18:22,732 --> 00:18:24,097
Good afternoon.

228
00:18:24,301 --> 00:18:25,701
Banshee County
Sheriff's Department.

229
00:18:25,769 --> 00:18:27,202
We can see who you are, man.

230
00:18:27,404 --> 00:18:29,204
Look, we just want
to ask you a few questions.

231
00:18:29,306 --> 00:18:30,364
Go fuck yourself, bitch.

232
00:18:30,574 --> 00:18:32,174
One of our girls
was killed on Amish land

233
00:18:32,275 --> 00:18:33,275
and you're landing on us?

234
00:18:33,443 --> 00:18:34,933
Typical racist
white man bullshit.

235
00:18:35,145 --> 00:18:36,510
Yeah, I get that a lot.

236
00:18:36,713 --> 00:18:38,044
Look, nobody's accusing
you guys of anything.

237
00:18:38,248 --> 00:18:39,340
We're just trying
to figure this thing out.

238
00:18:39,549 --> 00:18:40,846
Figure it out somewhere else.

239
00:18:41,051 --> 00:18:43,019
This is the rez, man.
You're trespassing.

240
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,552
Look, son, I don't want to argue
the finer points of the law with you,

241
00:18:45,755 --> 00:18:48,223
but we are investigating
a potential capital murder case.

242
00:18:48,425 --> 00:18:50,393
- So we have jurisdiction.
- We have jurisdiction?

243
00:18:50,594 --> 00:18:52,892
- Just go with it, okay?
- Get the fuck out.

244
00:18:56,066 --> 00:18:57,124
Fucking cops.

245
00:19:16,786 --> 00:19:18,344
We're looking for
Tommy Littlestone.

246
00:19:18,555 --> 00:19:19,783
We just want to talk to him.

247
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,310
Look, you guys
can talk to us here

248
00:19:21,358 --> 00:19:23,690
or you can talk to us
from a holding cell. Your choice.

249
00:19:23,894 --> 00:19:25,862
Why don't you go find the Amish
motherfucker who killed her?

250
00:19:26,062 --> 00:19:27,996
Get the fuck out of here.

251
00:19:39,009 --> 00:19:41,500
- Hi.
- How the fuck did you get in here?

252
00:19:41,711 --> 00:19:43,542
Hey, take it easy.
Take it easy.

253
00:19:43,747 --> 00:19:46,443
This is a friendly visit.
I just want to talk.

254
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,481
I'm not looking
for any trouble, okay?

255
00:19:48,685 --> 00:19:52,280
No? Well, it looks like
trouble is what you got.

256
00:19:59,629 --> 00:20:01,392
You're Chayton Littlestone.

257
00:20:01,598 --> 00:20:03,657
Just Chayton.

258
00:20:03,867 --> 00:20:05,596
Well, Chayton,

259
00:20:05,802 --> 00:20:08,532
I was just telling
your colleagues here

260
00:20:08,738 --> 00:20:10,330
I just want to talk.

261
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,701
You got no business
being on the rez, cop.

262
00:20:12,909 --> 00:20:14,509
Well, that's something
we can talk about.

263
00:20:14,511 --> 00:20:15,511
Far as I'm concerned,

264
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,740
you have no authority
on or off the reservation.

265
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:22,680
You see, all the land
around here

266
00:20:22,886 --> 00:20:26,754
was Kinaho land before
the white man ever sailed.

267
00:20:26,957 --> 00:20:29,118
And then your forefathers stole it,

268
00:20:29,326 --> 00:20:32,887
parceled it up and sold it
as if they were entitled.

269
00:20:33,096 --> 00:20:35,223
Just like you feel entitled
to walk into my house

270
00:20:35,432 --> 00:20:38,401
because you wear that piece
of polished tin.

271
00:20:38,601 --> 00:20:41,331
And now a red girl
has been killed on white man's land

272
00:20:41,538 --> 00:20:44,058
that should have rightfully belonged
to her people to begin with

273
00:20:44,207 --> 00:20:45,367
and you...

274
00:20:46,476 --> 00:20:48,068
you don't see
the audacity it takes

275
00:20:48,278 --> 00:20:50,576
for you to turn up here
pointing fingers?

276
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,374
I'm trying to find out
who killed that girl.

277
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,642
You won't find that here.

278
00:20:56,953 --> 00:20:59,114
If you didn't kill her,

279
00:20:59,322 --> 00:21:00,812
then you got nothing
to worry about.

280
00:21:03,693 --> 00:21:05,490
Do I look worried?

281
00:21:08,965 --> 00:21:10,592
- Oh, fuck!
- Fuck.

282
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,461
Shit, Hood's in there.

283
00:21:13,536 --> 00:21:15,094
- Open up!
- Kick his ass!

284
00:21:21,878 --> 00:21:23,345
Hit it, Emmett.
Hit it.

285
00:21:28,118 --> 00:21:29,779
Knock him out!

286
00:21:32,589 --> 00:21:34,580
- Fuck this.
- Watch out. Watch out.

287
00:21:40,663 --> 00:21:41,891
Get off!

288
00:21:54,978 --> 00:21:56,468
Hey, get off me, man!

289
00:21:59,516 --> 00:22:00,744
No! Hold still!

290
00:22:05,622 --> 00:22:06,919
Let me go, man.
Let me go!

291
00:22:07,123 --> 00:22:09,114
- Put your hands up!
- Put your hands up!

292
00:22:09,325 --> 00:22:10,622
Put your hands up!
Turn around!

293
00:22:10,827 --> 00:22:12,158
Turn around!

294
00:22:18,701 --> 00:22:20,726
Don't move.
Don't move.

295
00:22:32,215 --> 00:22:34,308
- On your knees!
- Stay down! Shut up!

296
00:22:44,627 --> 00:22:46,322
You're gonna bleed with me, cop.

297
00:22:46,529 --> 00:22:49,157
Just like your ancestors
bled with mine.

298
00:22:49,365 --> 00:22:50,423
Hood!

299
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,006
Hey!

300
00:23:49,626 --> 00:23:52,459
Well, that's something
you don't see every day.

301
00:23:54,531 --> 00:23:56,465
Everything all right in here?

302
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:04,331
Okay, which one of you assholes
is Tommy Littlestone?

303
00:24:11,915 --> 00:24:13,712
Hey, Tommy.

304
00:24:13,917 --> 00:24:16,010
Guess your brother ate
all the vitamins, huh?

305
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,174
Ow!

306
00:24:46,849 --> 00:24:48,146
Baby.

307
00:24:55,258 --> 00:24:57,419
Thanks for saving
my ass back there.

308
00:25:00,096 --> 00:25:03,725
Guy was about five seconds away
from tearing me apart.

309
00:25:06,569 --> 00:25:08,264
Well, we can't have that.

310
00:25:09,472 --> 00:25:11,770
Not when things are
just getting interesting.

311
00:25:14,944 --> 00:25:17,242
- Can I help you?
- Uh, yes.

312
00:25:17,447 --> 00:25:19,176
I'd like to see Sheriff Hood.

313
00:25:19,382 --> 00:25:22,215
The sheriff is busy right now, but
who can I tell him is here?

314
00:25:23,786 --> 00:25:25,617
Jason.

315
00:25:25,822 --> 00:25:28,086
Do you got a last name
like most people?

316
00:25:28,291 --> 00:25:30,259
Uh, Smith.

317
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,893
Have a seat, Smith.

318
00:25:32,095 --> 00:25:34,120
I'll let the sheriff
know that you're here.

319
00:25:53,983 --> 00:25:56,144
So...

320
00:25:56,352 --> 00:26:00,288
I got you on resisting arrest,

321
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:02,685
assaulting a police officer,

322
00:26:02,892 --> 00:26:04,359
carrying a concealed weapon,

323
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,560
trying to slice me open
with that concealed weapon.

324
00:26:06,562 --> 00:26:10,191
I could put you away
for 10 years on those alone.

325
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,765
But I'll bet

326
00:26:11,968 --> 00:26:13,936
I could also make you good
for the girl's murder.

327
00:26:16,806 --> 00:26:19,138
I don't kill Indians.

328
00:26:19,342 --> 00:26:20,502
No?

329
00:26:21,778 --> 00:26:22,972
What about your brother?

330
00:26:24,047 --> 00:26:27,016
You came onto the rez
without a federal warrant.

331
00:26:27,216 --> 00:26:28,581
These arrests are illegal.

332
00:26:28,785 --> 00:26:31,948
Yeah, see, you guys all say this to
me like I should give a shit.

333
00:26:32,155 --> 00:26:34,020
If you give a shit
about the dead girl,

334
00:26:34,223 --> 00:26:36,748
seems to me you should
be looking for the Amish kid.

335
00:26:40,163 --> 00:26:43,132
So you got nothing
to tell me about Lana

336
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:44,630
and Tommy?

337
00:26:49,205 --> 00:26:51,298
I'll see you again, cop,

338
00:26:51,507 --> 00:26:53,338
outside this cage.

339
00:26:59,582 --> 00:27:01,072
Ever the optimist.

340
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,593
So what? So I sent her
some e-mails.

341
00:27:12,795 --> 00:27:14,262
It doesn't mean anything.
I didn't do anything!

342
00:27:14,464 --> 00:27:15,464
Sheriff Hood.

343
00:27:15,631 --> 00:27:18,191
Your deputy just gave
us the rundown.

344
00:27:18,401 --> 00:27:20,426
Alison Medding.

345
00:27:20,636 --> 00:27:23,070
Ah, the new ADA, right?

346
00:27:23,272 --> 00:27:25,272
That's right. With Gordon filling
the mayor's slot,

347
00:27:25,408 --> 00:27:26,841
I will be running point on this.

348
00:27:27,043 --> 00:27:28,340
What does that mean exactly?

349
00:27:28,544 --> 00:27:31,206
It means it's my job to tell you that
you had no authority

350
00:27:31,414 --> 00:27:32,813
to go into Kinaho land
and start shaking people down.

351
00:27:33,015 --> 00:27:34,375
You get straight
to the point, huh?

352
00:27:34,484 --> 00:27:36,145
- We have a murdered girl.
- Yeah, I'm aware of that.

353
00:27:36,352 --> 00:27:38,047
And if this investigation is
compromised

354
00:27:38,254 --> 00:27:39,346
- by illegal arrests...
- Jesus Christ. Listen to you.

355
00:27:39,555 --> 00:27:41,079
...you'll blow the whole thing
before it gets started.

356
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:42,552
While you're standing here
worrying about rules,

357
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:44,056
I'm out there trying to find
the guy who did this.

358
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,023
Hey. That's enough.

359
00:27:46,229 --> 00:27:48,197
Now, do you have anything solid

360
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:50,127
tying these men
to the girl's murder?

361
00:27:51,367 --> 00:27:53,335
Well, when I asked him
if he killed the girl,

362
00:27:53,536 --> 00:27:54,696
the big one tried to kill me.

363
00:27:54,804 --> 00:27:56,644
Well, that's not exactly
conclusive now, is it?

364
00:27:56,672 --> 00:27:58,537
Tommy Littlestone
is 17 years old.

365
00:27:58,741 --> 00:28:00,701
You're questioning a minor
without representation.

366
00:28:00,843 --> 00:28:02,963
Not to mention your arrests
were illegal to begin with

367
00:28:03,146 --> 00:28:04,340
because you were out
of your jurisdiction.

368
00:28:04,547 --> 00:28:05,571
You two should meet.

369
00:28:05,782 --> 00:28:08,022
Chayton Littlestone
has two warrants in Jefferson County.

370
00:28:08,184 --> 00:28:09,651
Probably why he resisted today.

371
00:28:09,852 --> 00:28:10,852
They have priority,

372
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,511
so I'm having him transferred back
to their jurisdiction.

373
00:28:13,723 --> 00:28:15,554
Believe me,
they're welcome to him.

374
00:28:15,758 --> 00:28:17,726
You can take
the little brother now.

375
00:28:17,927 --> 00:28:19,622
Let's go.

376
00:28:19,829 --> 00:28:20,829
Tommy. Tommy.

377
00:28:20,997 --> 00:28:22,837
Don't say another word.
I'm shutting this down.

378
00:28:22,932 --> 00:28:24,991
- Come with us.
- We're not holding him any longer.

379
00:28:25,201 --> 00:28:27,032
- This your first murder case?
- It is.

380
00:28:27,236 --> 00:28:29,261
- Big career boost, huh?
- Damn straight.

381
00:28:29,472 --> 00:28:31,497
I plan to crush it.

382
00:28:32,575 --> 00:28:34,668
My boss doesn't like you.

383
00:28:34,877 --> 00:28:36,777
Don't be ridiculous.
Everyone likes me.

384
00:28:41,384 --> 00:28:43,818
- Sheriff Hood.
- Yeah?

385
00:28:44,954 --> 00:28:46,979
I've got something
you might want to hear.

386
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:49,385
- Uh...
- What?

387
00:28:49,592 --> 00:28:51,025
Someplace private we can talk?

388
00:28:52,829 --> 00:28:54,421
- You know?
- Yeah.

389
00:28:57,533 --> 00:28:59,694
It's crazy out there today, huh?

390
00:28:59,902 --> 00:29:02,142
- Is it always like that?
- You got something to tell me?

391
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,005
You're not my father.

392
00:29:13,216 --> 00:29:15,946
No, that's very true.

393
00:29:16,152 --> 00:29:19,053
Yeah, but see,
you have his name.

394
00:29:21,624 --> 00:29:23,615
I don't think
I introduced myself.

395
00:29:23,826 --> 00:29:25,691
I'm Jason Hood.

396
00:29:28,264 --> 00:29:30,391
I don't know who you are,

397
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,831
but you're not Lucas Hood.

398
00:29:37,807 --> 00:29:39,035
What do you want?

399
00:29:39,242 --> 00:29:42,336
Well, for starters,
where's my father?

400
00:29:42,545 --> 00:29:43,842
Your father is dead.

401
00:29:45,781 --> 00:29:47,009
I figured.

402
00:29:48,317 --> 00:29:51,013
- Did you kill him?
- No.

403
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,551
Why should I believe you?

404
00:30:01,464 --> 00:30:03,955
I have no reason to lie to you.

405
00:30:04,166 --> 00:30:06,259
You already got me nailed.

406
00:30:08,971 --> 00:30:10,996
You don't seem
too worried about that.

407
00:30:11,207 --> 00:30:12,799
You don't seem
too broken up for a guy

408
00:30:13,009 --> 00:30:15,409
who just learned
his father's dead.

409
00:30:15,611 --> 00:30:17,010
We weren't very close.

410
00:30:17,213 --> 00:30:20,080
If it makes you feel any better,
he died doing the right thing.

411
00:30:20,283 --> 00:30:22,080
Thanks.

412
00:30:22,285 --> 00:30:23,285
It doesn't.

413
00:30:23,452 --> 00:30:25,477
Yeah, I had a father
like that, too.

414
00:30:32,261 --> 00:30:33,660
So what's stopping me from just...

415
00:30:35,197 --> 00:30:36,437
walking out that door right now

416
00:30:36,632 --> 00:30:38,152
and blowing your shit
out of the water?

417
00:30:43,339 --> 00:30:45,603
If you really think I'm the guy who
killed your father,

418
00:30:45,808 --> 00:30:47,867
a cop, in cold blood,

419
00:30:48,077 --> 00:30:49,840
then had the balls
to steal his identity,

420
00:30:50,046 --> 00:30:53,311
do you really think it's a smart idea
to sit there and threaten me?

421
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,673
Come on, I'll buy you lunch.

422
00:31:23,713 --> 00:31:25,510
I'm fucking starving.

423
00:31:52,208 --> 00:31:53,903
I'll talk to her.

424
00:32:08,824 --> 00:32:10,689
Hello, Miriam.

425
00:32:14,296 --> 00:32:17,322
You allowed the elders
to send your only daughter away

426
00:32:17,533 --> 00:32:19,524
with nowhere to go.

427
00:32:19,735 --> 00:32:21,703
She would have ended up
in the streets.

428
00:32:21,904 --> 00:32:25,806
But I was there to put
a roof over her head and feed her.

429
00:32:26,008 --> 00:32:29,307
As I think you knew I would be,
right?

430
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,404
And now

431
00:32:33,616 --> 00:32:36,380
could it really be that you'd just
rather hang your laundry

432
00:32:36,585 --> 00:32:39,952
and leave your son to die
than speak to me,

433
00:32:40,156 --> 00:32:42,420
the only person who
might be able to help?

434
00:32:48,164 --> 00:32:49,164
Patia.

435
00:33:12,588 --> 00:33:14,453
- Walk to the house.
- To the house.

436
00:33:27,903 --> 00:33:29,200
We want the boy.

437
00:33:33,008 --> 00:33:35,169
Patia.
Patia, wait, please.

438
00:33:35,377 --> 00:33:36,617
- I can't talk to you.
- Please.

439
00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:39,509
Look, you can think
whatever you want about me,

440
00:33:39,715 --> 00:33:42,183
but you and Solomon
grew up together

441
00:33:42,384 --> 00:33:43,942
and I know you care for him.

442
00:33:44,153 --> 00:33:46,178
- You've got to help me.
- No, I can't help you.

443
00:33:46,388 --> 00:33:48,322
You can and you will.

444
00:33:48,524 --> 00:33:51,391
Is it true about Solomon
and the Indian girl?

445
00:33:53,696 --> 00:33:54,788
You know that little bridge
in the woods

446
00:33:54,997 --> 00:33:56,760
- where the boys used to fish?
- Yes.

447
00:33:56,966 --> 00:33:59,025
Go there and I'll meet you
there as soon as I can.

448
00:33:59,235 --> 00:34:01,965
Thank you. Thank you.

449
00:34:08,144 --> 00:34:10,135
Fucking cham!

450
00:34:10,346 --> 00:34:12,211
Kai, no.

451
00:34:12,414 --> 00:34:14,541
Get over here, you bun runner.

452
00:34:16,252 --> 00:34:18,482
Blessed are the peacemakers

453
00:34:18,687 --> 00:34:20,552
that they will be
called sons of God.

454
00:34:20,756 --> 00:34:22,951
Come on, you fucking Dutchy!

455
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:25,423
- Don't.
- Kai, don't.

456
00:34:25,628 --> 00:34:27,926
That's it, come on, you bitch.

457
00:34:31,534 --> 00:34:33,468
You're all brave men

458
00:34:34,804 --> 00:34:37,432
intimidating people
you know won't fight back.

459
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:40,871
I'll give you 30 seconds to get back
into your trucks and go.

460
00:34:44,446 --> 00:34:47,142
No, what I'm thinking is

461
00:34:47,349 --> 00:34:48,907
I'm gonna take this bat

462
00:34:49,118 --> 00:34:52,144
and shove it up your bitch ass and
see how you like that.

463
00:34:52,354 --> 00:34:54,652
- Show him.
- I see.

464
00:35:01,597 --> 00:35:03,360
- Oh!
- Fuck!

465
00:35:03,566 --> 00:35:04,624
Let's go.
Be strong, man.

466
00:35:04,834 --> 00:35:05,834
Come on, right here.

467
00:35:08,938 --> 00:35:10,769
- He's going nuts.
- Hold up, hold up.

468
00:35:11,907 --> 00:35:14,000
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Wait, wait.

469
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:16,075
Crazy. Crazy.

470
00:35:17,479 --> 00:35:19,003
Do you know what's worse than getting
your testicles crushed

471
00:35:19,215 --> 00:35:21,046
with a baseball bat?

472
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,330
Getting them crushed again.

473
00:35:22,518 --> 00:35:24,543
Oh!

474
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,062
Go home.

475
00:35:43,005 --> 00:35:45,064
We're coming back
for you, Dutchy.

476
00:35:45,274 --> 00:35:47,469
Are you hiding the boy?
'Cause if you are...

477
00:35:47,676 --> 00:35:50,440
You dare speak to me like this?

478
00:35:50,646 --> 00:35:52,136
As if I would do such a thing.

479
00:36:15,671 --> 00:36:17,138
Kai.

480
00:36:25,414 --> 00:36:26,472
Leah.

481
00:36:33,322 --> 00:36:36,416
To the Lord our God belong
mercies and forgiveness

482
00:36:36,625 --> 00:36:38,490
though we have
sinned against him.

483
00:36:39,762 --> 00:36:42,595
This is about the life
of your grandchild.

484
00:36:42,798 --> 00:36:46,199
If Kai can help,
I will not be the one to stop him.

485
00:36:54,043 --> 00:36:55,874
Mudder.

486
00:37:15,064 --> 00:37:16,463
So these guys killed my father

487
00:37:16,665 --> 00:37:19,862
and then you just killed them
and figured what the hell,

488
00:37:20,069 --> 00:37:22,003
I always wanted to be a sheriff?

489
00:37:23,305 --> 00:37:26,001
Let's just say
I needed to become someone else

490
00:37:26,208 --> 00:37:28,699
and the opportunity presented itself.

491
00:37:28,911 --> 00:37:30,708
Your turn.

492
00:37:30,913 --> 00:37:33,541
Well, I was working for
these guys out in Portland.

493
00:37:33,749 --> 00:37:36,309
- What kind of guys?
- Pretty much what you think.

494
00:37:36,518 --> 00:37:39,419
You know, bad guys,
bad-tempered, bad drugs.

495
00:37:39,621 --> 00:37:42,454
Things got uncool
and I decided it was time to split.

496
00:37:42,658 --> 00:37:44,990
And they sent some asshole
after me back in Nevada.

497
00:37:45,194 --> 00:37:47,355
They sent someone after you?

498
00:37:47,563 --> 00:37:50,498
That means you either took
something that didn't belong to you

499
00:37:50,699 --> 00:37:52,894
or you fucked someone
that didn't belong to you.

500
00:37:53,102 --> 00:37:55,593
Yeah, one of those things.

501
00:37:57,406 --> 00:37:58,964
You boys need anything more?

502
00:38:00,776 --> 00:38:02,437
You got any pie?

503
00:38:02,644 --> 00:38:04,509
Look around you, son.

504
00:38:04,713 --> 00:38:08,774
Does this look like
the kind of place that serves pie?

505
00:38:08,984 --> 00:38:09,984
Thanks, Sugar.

506
00:38:10,185 --> 00:38:12,585
- We're good.
- How good?

507
00:38:12,788 --> 00:38:13,846
Good enough.

508
00:38:19,128 --> 00:38:20,789
Here's what I'm thinking.

509
00:38:20,996 --> 00:38:24,329
You got everyone here believing
that you're Lucas Hood, right?

510
00:38:24,533 --> 00:38:25,591
That takes some doing.

511
00:38:25,801 --> 00:38:28,065
There's identification,
social security,

512
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:30,670
credit card numbers, the works.

513
00:38:30,873 --> 00:38:32,807
Do you know how to do all that?

514
00:38:33,008 --> 00:38:34,976
I know a guy.

515
00:38:35,177 --> 00:38:39,113
I'm thinking of
just disappearing.

516
00:38:39,314 --> 00:38:40,838
You know, like going
up to Canada

517
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:43,518
and maybe get work
with the fishing fleets.

518
00:38:46,722 --> 00:38:48,280
I just... I don't...

519
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:51,459
I don't want to be looking over
my shoulder for the rest of my life.

520
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:03,870
Yeah, I can help you out.

521
00:39:06,141 --> 00:39:07,870
But it's gonna take a few days.

522
00:39:08,077 --> 00:39:11,137
So in the meantime, I'm gonna need
you to lay low for a while.

523
00:39:11,346 --> 00:39:12,574
You understand?

524
00:39:12,781 --> 00:39:14,078
That's one of the few
skill sets I do possess.

525
00:39:14,283 --> 00:39:15,875
Shut up.

526
00:39:16,085 --> 00:39:18,383
You're gonna check in to the Valley
Motel and you're gonna stay there.

527
00:39:18,587 --> 00:39:20,418
I don't want to see
your face around town.

528
00:39:20,622 --> 00:39:22,351
I'll come to you.

529
00:39:22,558 --> 00:39:25,049
We do the thing,
then you say good-bye.

530
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:28,286
You go off, start your new life.

531
00:39:28,497 --> 00:39:29,896
And you do not come back.

532
00:39:35,003 --> 00:39:36,334
Hey, where you going?

533
00:39:36,538 --> 00:39:39,029
In case you hadn't noticed,
I'm a little busy.

534
00:39:39,241 --> 00:39:41,072
You mean you actually
do the job?

535
00:39:41,276 --> 00:39:42,766
Now and then.

536
00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:49,448
He just leave me with the check?

537
00:39:49,651 --> 00:39:51,243
It's on the house.

538
00:39:52,688 --> 00:39:54,588
Well, thanks for lunch.

539
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:57,190
- What the fuck?!
- Sit down.

540
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,451
Ah, I'm fucking bleeding.

541
00:40:01,697 --> 00:40:02,891
Pay attention.

542
00:40:05,467 --> 00:40:08,664
I saw your father die
right over there.

543
00:40:08,871 --> 00:40:11,237
He didn't deserve it.

544
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,136
And the man who just
walked out this door,

545
00:40:14,343 --> 00:40:16,504
he killed the men who did it.

546
00:40:16,712 --> 00:40:19,613
Now, you may find this
hard to believe,

547
00:40:19,815 --> 00:40:22,909
given his winning personality,

548
00:40:23,118 --> 00:40:26,087
but the man actually
has friends here.

549
00:40:27,189 --> 00:40:28,781
Good friends,

550
00:40:28,991 --> 00:40:31,425
if you take my meaning.

551
00:40:31,627 --> 00:40:34,721
I know because I'm one of them.

552
00:40:35,797 --> 00:40:37,924
And if I get as much as an inkling

553
00:40:38,133 --> 00:40:40,431
that you pose any threat to him,

554
00:40:40,636 --> 00:40:43,434
I will personally
turn your father's grave

555
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:46,904
into a family plot.

556
00:40:48,544 --> 00:40:51,104
Do you understand?

557
00:40:51,313 --> 00:40:52,974
Yes, I understand.

558
00:41:00,522 --> 00:41:02,513
Let me get you a Band-Aid.

559
00:41:25,547 --> 00:41:29,039
No! Get off me!

560
00:41:29,251 --> 00:41:30,980
Get off of me!

561
00:42:14,463 --> 00:42:15,463
No!

562
00:42:22,537 --> 00:42:24,232
No! No!

563
00:42:56,972 --> 00:42:58,166
Hey.

564
00:43:00,876 --> 00:43:02,002
You okay?

565
00:43:03,178 --> 00:43:05,009
Hey, hey, hey.
It's okay.

566
00:43:05,213 --> 00:43:08,649
Hey, hey, hey. You're okay.
What happened?

567
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:10,784
- Rebecca, what happened?
- A man.

568
00:43:10,986 --> 00:43:13,454
- What man?
- In the woods. He attacked me.

569
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,426
Hey!

570
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:10,039
What happened?

571
00:44:10,245 --> 00:44:11,965
- Let me see that.
- It's nothing. I'm fine.

572
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,320
You need to get that looked at.

573
00:44:13,415 --> 00:44:15,610
I think I might have clipped him.
We got to go back in.

574
00:44:15,817 --> 00:44:17,182
No, no, no, no.
No, no. Not you.

575
00:44:17,386 --> 00:44:19,183
- Not like this.
- We're wasting time.

576
00:44:19,388 --> 00:44:21,686
Brock has got the staties combing
the woods for Solomon.

577
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:23,323
Whoever is in there,
they're gonna find him.

578
00:44:23,525 --> 00:44:25,186
I'm fine.

579
00:44:25,394 --> 00:44:27,885
When was the last time
you actually slept?

580
00:44:29,498 --> 00:44:31,261
You've got to give it a rest.

581
00:44:33,769 --> 00:44:36,135
I'm gonna drive you home, okay?

582
00:44:36,338 --> 00:44:37,396
Okay.

583
00:44:53,555 --> 00:44:55,614
I don't live here.

584
00:44:55,824 --> 00:44:57,223
I know.

585
00:44:57,426 --> 00:44:59,656
You haven't eaten anything today.

586
00:45:00,896 --> 00:45:02,454
I'm gonna make you something.

587
00:45:11,706 --> 00:45:14,140
I said posse, idiot.

588
00:45:42,904 --> 00:45:45,771
- You want some more?
- Yeah.

589
00:45:45,974 --> 00:45:47,441
Cheers.

590
00:45:52,581 --> 00:45:54,105
With everything that's happened in
the last couple of days,

591
00:45:54,316 --> 00:45:56,580
you know what's
sticking with me?

592
00:45:59,054 --> 00:46:01,887
Lana's mother told me

593
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:04,456
her girl was gonna
be a schoolteacher.

594
00:46:06,361 --> 00:46:08,261
I wanted to do that once.

595
00:46:10,198 --> 00:46:11,859
A long time ago.

596
00:46:27,148 --> 00:46:28,410
How's your head?

597
00:46:32,287 --> 00:46:33,618
Fine.

598
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:46,590
I should probably go.

599
00:47:01,783 --> 00:47:03,375
You should go.

600
00:47:09,991 --> 00:47:11,891
This is a bad idea.
