1
00:01:05,897 --> 00:01:08,195
Uh-huh, Barbie.

2
00:02:24,843 --> 00:02:26,367
Hey.

3
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,542
Hey.

4
00:02:29,748 --> 00:02:31,841
So how were you planning
on getting home

5
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,142
if I hadn't shown up?

6
00:02:33,351 --> 00:02:35,342
How do you get anywhere from here?

7
00:02:35,553 --> 00:02:36,645
Middle of nowhere.

8
00:02:36,855 --> 00:02:38,255
Yeah, that's where they build them.

9
00:02:39,891 --> 00:02:41,188
They give you a bus schedule.

10
00:02:47,132 --> 00:02:49,396
Thanks for coming.

11
00:02:49,601 --> 00:02:50,898
No problem.

12
00:04:42,647 --> 00:04:43,944
You okay?

13
00:04:45,316 --> 00:04:47,682
It doesn't feel like
you think it would.

14
00:04:47,886 --> 00:04:48,910
Getting out?

15
00:04:50,655 --> 00:04:52,213
Yeah.

16
00:04:52,424 --> 00:04:54,688
But you would know.

17
00:04:54,893 --> 00:04:57,862
Yeah, reentry's a bitch

18
00:04:58,063 --> 00:05:01,123
under any circumstances.

19
00:05:01,332 --> 00:05:03,698
You must be missing your kids.

20
00:05:03,902 --> 00:05:05,233
Sometimes in bed

21
00:05:05,437 --> 00:05:08,099
I'd pretend that they'd crawled
into my arms like they used to

22
00:05:08,273 --> 00:05:11,299
when they were little
and they couldn't sleep.

23
00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:13,841
Deva's going through some stuff.

24
00:05:14,045 --> 00:05:15,979
She needs her mom.

25
00:05:16,181 --> 00:05:17,944
And how's Max?

26
00:05:18,149 --> 00:05:21,380
From what I can see,
he's all about his skateboard.

27
00:05:21,586 --> 00:05:24,350
You'll see for yourself
soon enough.

28
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,521
Can we stop somewhere to eat?

29
00:05:27,725 --> 00:05:29,386
I'm starving.

30
00:05:48,913 --> 00:05:49,913
Good?

31
00:05:50,115 --> 00:05:51,795
How much do you remember
about prison food?

32
00:05:59,257 --> 00:06:00,781
You know,
there was this one time

33
00:06:01,025 --> 00:06:02,856
it was the warden's birthday,

34
00:06:03,061 --> 00:06:05,029
anniversary, something,
I don't know.

35
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,698
He decided he wanted to
give us a special meal, right?

36
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:11,892
So he has the cooks
make us these big steaks.

37
00:06:12,103 --> 00:06:13,400
Pretty good.

38
00:06:13,605 --> 00:06:17,166
With potatoes and pie for dessert.

39
00:06:17,342 --> 00:06:20,641
It's funny... some guys,
they just inhaled it.

40
00:06:20,845 --> 00:06:24,281
I mean, it had been so long since...

41
00:06:25,917 --> 00:06:28,283
Other guys, they took it back
to their tables and sat,

42
00:06:28,486 --> 00:06:31,421
looked at it, just started crying.

43
00:06:31,623 --> 00:06:33,454
I get it.

44
00:06:33,658 --> 00:06:35,592
Then there was these other guys

45
00:06:35,793 --> 00:06:38,421
who took the steak and threw it
against the fucking wall.

46
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:41,622
Like telling the place
to go fuck itself, you know?

47
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,130
Sean, get back here.

48
00:06:43,334 --> 00:06:45,097
- I got it!
- Give it back!

49
00:06:59,784 --> 00:07:01,115
That's so not fair.

50
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:02,919
You're supposed
to be setting an example.

51
00:07:03,087 --> 00:07:04,418
I told you this was a bad idea.

52
00:07:04,622 --> 00:07:06,522
I got to tell you,
I'm with Sean on this one.

53
00:07:06,724 --> 00:07:09,090
- He wasn't sharing.
- Sure, take the girl's side.

54
00:07:09,294 --> 00:07:10,761
Yeah, that's what I'm doing.

55
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,097
This could be Banshee.

56
00:07:17,302 --> 00:07:19,964
But it doesn't feel the same.

57
00:07:30,848 --> 00:07:33,681
Oh, my God. I can't believe this.

58
00:07:35,286 --> 00:07:38,653
Deva had one just like this.
She loved this thing.

59
00:07:38,856 --> 00:07:42,155
She slept with it,
took it to school with her.

60
00:07:44,395 --> 00:07:46,863
We read The Last Unicorn
together when she was little.

61
00:07:47,065 --> 00:07:48,362
It was her favorite book.

62
00:07:51,002 --> 00:07:54,096
"I would enter your sleep if I could

63
00:07:54,305 --> 00:07:56,296
and guard you there..."

64
00:07:56,507 --> 00:07:59,135
Something something.

65
00:07:59,344 --> 00:08:01,676
"But I cannot enter
unless you dream of me."

66
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:03,346
There you go.

67
00:08:03,548 --> 00:08:06,210
- You read The Last Unicorn?
- In prison.

68
00:08:06,417 --> 00:08:08,385
It was a small library.

69
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,558
What is it?

70
00:08:17,762 --> 00:08:19,024
Nothing.

71
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,230
Tell me.

72
00:08:22,867 --> 00:08:24,198
I just...

73
00:08:25,503 --> 00:08:28,131
The whole time I was away,
I thought I knew what I was missing.

74
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:31,331
Turns out,
I only knew the half of it.

75
00:08:31,542 --> 00:08:33,407
You should buy it for her.

76
00:08:53,965 --> 00:08:55,899
- This a Revell?
- Good eye.

77
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,397
You a modeler?

78
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,594
Once upon a time.

79
00:09:02,607 --> 00:09:05,167
- How much?
- It's 10.

80
00:09:05,376 --> 00:09:06,376
Thank you.

81
00:09:13,484 --> 00:09:15,714
I wouldn't have pegged you
for the model airplane type.

82
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,615
When I was a kid,

83
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:22,389
about the only time
I spent with the old man...

84
00:09:22,593 --> 00:09:23,958
building model planes.

85
00:09:26,597 --> 00:09:27,837
In all the time I've known you,

86
00:09:27,932 --> 00:09:29,492
you've never once
mentioned your father.

87
00:09:29,634 --> 00:09:31,534
Really?

88
00:09:31,703 --> 00:09:33,534
There's no reason to start now.

89
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:09,233
What is it?

90
00:10:10,842 --> 00:10:12,036
It's nothing.

91
00:10:12,276 --> 00:10:13,276
Nothing.

92
00:10:15,346 --> 00:10:17,974
Security camera,
upper right-hand corner on a swivel.

93
00:10:18,182 --> 00:10:20,062
Won't do them any good
if they get hit at night.

94
00:10:20,151 --> 00:10:22,483
You've been away too long. See
that ring around the outside lens?

95
00:10:22,687 --> 00:10:25,121
That's LED lighting.
Finds you in the dark.

96
00:10:27,024 --> 00:10:29,151
But that Vicon
in the window display...

97
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,624
- That's a camera?
- Yeah, it's wireless.

98
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:33,389
It's no problem
throwing off the signal.

99
00:10:33,564 --> 00:10:34,997
Totally Mickey Mouse.

100
00:10:36,334 --> 00:10:37,699
Listen to you.

101
00:10:37,902 --> 00:10:40,029
Well, it is.

102
00:10:40,238 --> 00:10:41,758
You know, if the safe
is the same make,

103
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,466
this place would be child's play.

104
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,137
But if you get jammed up front...

105
00:10:49,347 --> 00:10:51,872
There is an alley running
behind the whole block.

106
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,516
I'm sure they have a door to it.

107
00:10:53,718 --> 00:10:54,878
Look at you.

108
00:11:01,726 --> 00:11:03,626
What?

109
00:11:03,828 --> 00:11:04,920
That car.

110
00:11:08,533 --> 00:11:09,659
- A tail?
- I don't know.

111
00:11:09,867 --> 00:11:11,387
- But you've tagged it before?
- Twice.

112
00:11:11,502 --> 00:11:12,628
Where?

113
00:11:12,837 --> 00:11:15,465
Next street up,
down a block to the right.

114
00:11:15,673 --> 00:11:18,198
- The driver?
- Couldn't see. Tinted windows.

115
00:11:18,409 --> 00:11:19,808
I'll bring the truck around front.

116
00:11:19,977 --> 00:11:21,035
Right.

117
00:12:45,296 --> 00:12:47,321
- Behind.
- I know.

118
00:12:47,532 --> 00:12:48,624
Wait here.

119
00:13:19,497 --> 00:13:21,465
Excuse me. Is everything okay?

120
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:24,294
Yeah, sorry. I thought this was
a friend of mine's car.

121
00:13:30,408 --> 00:13:32,706
Would you mind
just giving me a hand?

122
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:35,105
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

123
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,940
Guess I got too much stuff.

124
00:13:45,323 --> 00:13:46,620
Thanks.

125
00:15:08,372 --> 00:15:10,431
Where are you going?

126
00:15:10,641 --> 00:15:12,939
Turnpike's that way.

127
00:15:13,144 --> 00:15:15,772
Yeah, I thought
we could take a little detour.

128
00:15:18,115 --> 00:15:20,106
Something I want to show you.

129
00:15:20,317 --> 00:15:21,317
What is it?

130
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,817
Won't take more than a couple hours.

131
00:15:24,021 --> 00:15:25,818
Unless you're in a hurry to get home.

132
00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:29,653
Home.

133
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,052
Wait.

134
00:16:16,073 --> 00:16:17,370
I got you something.

135
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:21,371
It's where we're going.

136
00:16:21,579 --> 00:16:23,103
It's our house.

137
00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:53,301
It's the house.

138
00:17:02,186 --> 00:17:05,781
I figured we could, I don't know,

139
00:17:06,023 --> 00:17:07,718
disappear here.

140
00:17:10,728 --> 00:17:12,662
Oh, my God, you own this?

141
00:17:12,863 --> 00:17:15,058
Paid cash.

142
00:17:15,266 --> 00:17:17,496
Set up a trust for the taxes.

143
00:17:22,406 --> 00:17:24,033
Just wanted you to see it.

144
00:17:46,797 --> 00:17:48,355
It was a good plan.

145
00:18:40,384 --> 00:18:41,908
You know, I've been thinking.

146
00:18:44,021 --> 00:18:46,455
It's probably time
for me to be moving on.

147
00:18:48,826 --> 00:18:51,351
Ever since I got to Banshee,

148
00:18:51,562 --> 00:18:52,893
things have...

149
00:18:53,097 --> 00:18:56,533
well, I've made things worse for you,

150
00:18:56,734 --> 00:18:58,497
your family.

151
00:18:58,702 --> 00:19:00,761
I mean, that wasn't the plan,

152
00:19:00,971 --> 00:19:02,836
but that's what happened.

153
00:19:04,808 --> 00:19:06,435
You tried to tell me.

154
00:19:12,816 --> 00:19:14,340
Anyway, I...

155
00:19:14,551 --> 00:19:18,715
I can't play lawman forever, can I?

156
00:19:20,024 --> 00:19:23,653
Yeah, but where would you go?

157
00:19:26,263 --> 00:19:27,787
What would you do?

158
00:19:32,002 --> 00:19:33,663
Just go.

159
00:19:36,507 --> 00:19:37,997
Maybe come back here.

160
00:19:39,743 --> 00:19:40,903
I don't know.

161
00:19:45,616 --> 00:19:48,642
I just can't keep doing the things
I've been doing to people.

162
00:19:54,591 --> 00:19:55,819
No more.

163
00:19:59,296 --> 00:20:00,388
No more.

164
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:14,107
When I got out and I found you,

165
00:20:14,311 --> 00:20:17,371
you had a home, a family.

166
00:20:17,581 --> 00:20:21,039
You had all the things
you were supposed to have with me.

167
00:20:21,251 --> 00:20:22,718
And that fucking killed me.

168
00:20:27,057 --> 00:20:28,388
Then I saw Deva.

169
00:20:30,928 --> 00:20:33,453
And the truth is
I just didn't want to go.

170
00:20:38,335 --> 00:20:39,700
So I told myself

171
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,967
that by staying,
I was protecting you.

172
00:20:42,172 --> 00:20:43,799
- From Rabbit.
- Yeah.

173
00:20:47,411 --> 00:20:49,106
I mean, I believed it.

174
00:20:50,447 --> 00:20:52,608
I really believed it.

175
00:20:52,816 --> 00:20:55,216
But he was always really after me.

176
00:20:57,321 --> 00:20:58,652
It was never you.

177
00:21:01,091 --> 00:21:02,319
So...

178
00:21:06,296 --> 00:21:08,958
best thing I can do
for you is to leave.

179
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:34,910
What is it?

180
00:23:35,112 --> 00:23:37,546
Well, maybe nothing.
Stay there.

181
00:25:48,478 --> 00:25:51,276
- Sheriff Hood.
- Agent Racine.

182
00:25:52,649 --> 00:25:53,673
Let's go.

183
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,550
The FBI dropped in for a visit.

184
00:25:58,755 --> 00:26:01,189
- So I see.
- Mrs. Hopewell.

185
00:26:01,391 --> 00:26:03,052
Congratulations...

186
00:26:04,328 --> 00:26:06,888
on your release from prison.

187
00:26:12,235 --> 00:26:13,600
Sit anywhere.

188
00:26:14,971 --> 00:26:16,598
You won't be needing that.

189
00:26:16,807 --> 00:26:19,207
Maybe. You want to tell us
why you're here?

190
00:26:19,409 --> 00:26:22,776
Heard you had a visitor
while you were inside.

191
00:26:22,979 --> 00:26:25,539
Oh, you knew?

192
00:26:25,749 --> 00:26:27,478
After the fact.

193
00:26:29,086 --> 00:26:30,314
You don't know me well.

194
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:34,650
If you did, you'd know
that putting Rabbit down...

195
00:26:34,858 --> 00:26:36,155
is pretty much it for me.

196
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,056
Why? What is it
between you and Rabbit?

197
00:26:42,332 --> 00:26:44,266
When I was a young agent...

198
00:26:46,036 --> 00:26:47,799
I worked a few angles.

199
00:26:49,206 --> 00:26:50,798
Got Rabbit's case for myself.

200
00:26:51,007 --> 00:26:54,170
I figured I'd grab a few headlines,

201
00:26:54,378 --> 00:26:56,437
move up the ladder.

202
00:26:56,646 --> 00:26:59,444
But I busted him too soon.

203
00:26:59,649 --> 00:27:01,139
His lawyers shredded me.

204
00:27:01,351 --> 00:27:03,751
Got my wiretaps thrown out.

205
00:27:03,954 --> 00:27:07,412
A week later,
my confidential informant

206
00:27:07,624 --> 00:27:10,149
was murdered in Astoria

207
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,794
along with his wife

208
00:27:12,996 --> 00:27:14,327
and two daughters.

209
00:27:17,801 --> 00:27:19,860
So the way I see it,

210
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:24,006
those little girls and anyone else
he's killed since then,

211
00:27:24,207 --> 00:27:26,266
they're all on me.

212
00:27:28,311 --> 00:27:29,539
You have an ashtray?

213
00:27:32,516 --> 00:27:35,610
Never even tried to quit.
Loved it too much.

214
00:27:35,819 --> 00:27:39,846
And now they tell me
I don't have too much time left.

215
00:27:40,056 --> 00:27:41,683
Six months.

216
00:27:41,892 --> 00:27:42,892
A year.

217
00:27:43,093 --> 00:27:46,153
I don't know what happens
to us when we die,

218
00:27:46,363 --> 00:27:49,230
but I don't want to go out
with all those deaths on my head.

219
00:27:49,433 --> 00:27:50,457
Yeah, that's touching,

220
00:27:50,667 --> 00:27:52,747
but it still doesn't explain
why you're following us.

221
00:27:52,769 --> 00:27:54,964
Waiting for her to get out.

222
00:27:55,172 --> 00:27:57,299
Figured Rabbit would be waiting, too.

223
00:27:57,507 --> 00:27:58,667
I still think that.

224
00:27:58,875 --> 00:28:00,172
So you're using us as bait?

225
00:28:00,377 --> 00:28:01,674
- Exactly.
- But you're wrong.

226
00:28:01,878 --> 00:28:03,175
He's not coming.

227
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,871
He's tired, worn out.

228
00:28:06,082 --> 00:28:08,073
- He's given up.
- What about you, Sheriff?

229
00:28:08,285 --> 00:28:10,150
You also believe
our Rabbit has decided to

230
00:28:10,353 --> 00:28:11,911
- forgive and forget?
- No.

231
00:28:12,122 --> 00:28:14,249
You think he knows
my father better than I do?

232
00:28:14,458 --> 00:28:17,018
It's not about what he knows.
It's about what I know.

233
00:28:17,227 --> 00:28:19,752
So when Rabbit shows up,
you plan to be there.

234
00:28:19,963 --> 00:28:22,022
That's right.
Then deliver him to justice.

235
00:28:22,232 --> 00:28:24,257
By which I mean
shoot him till he's dead.

236
00:28:24,468 --> 00:28:26,708
And if we get killed in the process,
that's just too bad?

237
00:28:26,803 --> 00:28:29,101
You don't have anyone
to blame but yourself.

238
00:28:29,306 --> 00:28:32,332
You had him at point-blank range.

239
00:28:32,542 --> 00:28:35,909
You think of it, you should
thank me for having your back.

240
00:28:36,112 --> 00:28:37,992
Did you hear the man?
We should be thanking him.

241
00:28:38,114 --> 00:28:40,074
- How about that?
- We should be working together.

242
00:28:40,116 --> 00:28:41,116
- We can't.
- Why not?

243
00:28:41,318 --> 00:28:43,946
- Because we don't trust you.
- You should.

244
00:28:44,154 --> 00:28:46,520
You of all people.

245
00:28:46,723 --> 00:28:47,723
Why?

246
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:52,585
For starters,
I know you're not Lucas Hood.

247
00:28:58,301 --> 00:28:59,700
Hey, hey, hey.

248
00:29:01,304 --> 00:29:05,070
My gun is in the large compartment.

249
00:29:10,914 --> 00:29:13,144
I'm still waiting to hear
what you got to say.

250
00:29:15,952 --> 00:29:18,921
Fifteen years ago,
Capital Diamond Company.

251
00:29:21,258 --> 00:29:22,258
I'm sorry?

252
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,625
Two thieves broke in that night

253
00:29:25,829 --> 00:29:27,729
and one got away.

254
00:29:27,931 --> 00:29:30,957
He or she was never caught.

255
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:33,431
But you weren't so lucky, were you?

256
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:39,331
I was there watching
that cop Bonner interrogate you.

257
00:29:39,543 --> 00:29:41,204
You didn't give him a thing.

258
00:29:41,478 --> 00:29:44,072
Hell, we still don't know
your real name.

259
00:29:44,281 --> 00:29:46,749
Then I show up in Banshee

260
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:47,950
and there you are.

261
00:29:48,151 --> 00:29:49,778
Lucas Hood.

262
00:29:49,986 --> 00:29:51,578
A sheriff, no less.

263
00:29:52,289 --> 00:29:54,086
I think you must have me confused...

264
00:29:54,291 --> 00:29:56,316
No, no, don't.

265
00:29:56,526 --> 00:29:58,460
Don't waste my time.

266
00:30:00,497 --> 00:30:03,364
Those bodies your people
dug up in the woods,

267
00:30:03,567 --> 00:30:04,625
one of them was stolen.

268
00:30:04,834 --> 00:30:06,267
Someone wanted that body gone

269
00:30:06,469 --> 00:30:10,132
before any DNA trace samples
could be taken.

270
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,500
Turns out there was more
than enough DNA on the clothes

271
00:30:12,676 --> 00:30:14,769
that poor sucker
was wearing when he died.

272
00:30:14,978 --> 00:30:18,004
And the DNA belonged
to one Lucas Hood.

273
00:30:20,417 --> 00:30:24,285
He had his blood profiled like
everyone else in law enforcement.

274
00:30:25,989 --> 00:30:29,516
So that makes you something
of a mystery, doesn't it?

275
00:30:35,532 --> 00:30:37,056
Would you mind

276
00:30:37,267 --> 00:30:40,293
putting a little water in this?

277
00:30:59,589 --> 00:31:01,389
He knows who you are.
You can't let him leave.

278
00:31:01,424 --> 00:31:03,551
Enough people have died over this.

279
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,994
So...

280
00:31:13,803 --> 00:31:15,896
can I count on your cooperation?

281
00:31:21,811 --> 00:31:23,073
No more.

282
00:31:33,957 --> 00:31:35,891
So we help you find Rabbit...

283
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:42,124
what happens next?

284
00:31:42,332 --> 00:31:46,132
You do that, as far as I'm concerned,

285
00:31:46,336 --> 00:31:49,066
I never even have to ask
the next question.

286
00:31:49,272 --> 00:31:50,432
What question?

287
00:31:53,677 --> 00:31:55,144
What question?

288
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,705
Just who the hell you really are.

289
00:32:12,429 --> 00:32:13,691
- You okay?
- Yeah.

290
00:32:13,863 --> 00:32:15,091
Stay there.

291
00:32:45,695 --> 00:32:47,162
On three.

292
00:32:47,363 --> 00:32:48,421
Okay?

293
00:34:33,136 --> 00:34:34,136
Hey!

294
00:35:17,814 --> 00:35:18,814
Shit.

295
00:35:25,255 --> 00:35:26,255
Rabbit.

296
00:38:37,447 --> 00:38:40,109
He's never gonna stop coming.

297
00:38:40,316 --> 00:38:42,011
Not until we're both dead.

298
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,046
Nope.

299
00:38:49,425 --> 00:38:50,653
I'm here.

300
00:41:11,467 --> 00:41:13,799
- Back from the hill.
- Yep.

301
00:41:20,576 --> 00:41:24,307
So you back a day late, aren't you?

302
00:41:26,349 --> 00:41:28,044
Yeah, we took a detour.

303
00:41:36,092 --> 00:41:37,354
So how'd it go?

304
00:41:40,162 --> 00:41:41,652
Someone tried to kill us.

305
00:41:45,401 --> 00:41:47,460
Was it Rabbit's people?

306
00:41:49,939 --> 00:41:52,737
He's still out there, huh?
What happened?

307
00:41:54,577 --> 00:41:56,545
Okay.

308
00:41:56,746 --> 00:42:00,147
Well, I guess

309
00:42:00,349 --> 00:42:02,249
you won't be leaving just yet.

310
00:42:04,253 --> 00:42:05,515
I can't.

311
00:42:07,356 --> 00:42:10,154
I can't say I'm sorry

312
00:42:10,359 --> 00:42:13,157
to have you around a bit longer.

313
00:42:15,031 --> 00:42:17,158
What can I say?
You keep me young.

314
00:42:28,577 --> 00:42:31,910
And you're very generous
with my whiskey.

315
00:42:32,114 --> 00:42:34,241
Especially my good whiskey.

316
00:42:41,223 --> 00:42:43,054
You know,

317
00:42:43,259 --> 00:42:46,194
every time I think
I know the way forward...

318
00:42:48,464 --> 00:42:52,264
something just kicks me
back on my ass, you know?

319
00:42:53,903 --> 00:42:55,564
It's like, you know...

320
00:42:58,674 --> 00:43:00,107
it's...

321
00:43:04,347 --> 00:43:06,144
Fuck, I don't know.

322
00:43:06,349 --> 00:43:09,284
Like you're still inside.

323
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,616
People like you and me,

324
00:43:13,823 --> 00:43:16,656
we don't need bars.

325
00:43:16,859 --> 00:43:19,453
We build our own cells.

326
00:43:19,662 --> 00:43:21,892
When you live like we live,

327
00:43:22,098 --> 00:43:23,759
it goes without saying.

328
00:43:23,966 --> 00:43:26,127
We're gonna find ourselves
in places

329
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:28,633
we never imagined we'd be

330
00:43:28,838 --> 00:43:32,399
looking back and wondering
how the hell we got there

331
00:43:32,608 --> 00:43:36,237
and why the hell it seems
you can't leave.

332
00:43:38,347 --> 00:43:41,145
There's something broken in us.

333
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:45,252
Something that we don't have
that other people do

334
00:43:45,454 --> 00:43:48,753
that lets them settle down
and find peace

335
00:43:48,958 --> 00:43:51,085
and dream of a better life.

336
00:43:52,661 --> 00:43:54,356
People like you and me,

337
00:43:54,563 --> 00:43:57,498
we can't afford those dreams.

338
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:58,860
Why not?

339
00:44:00,202 --> 00:44:02,602
Because of what we have done.

340
00:44:05,508 --> 00:44:09,376
There are ghosts
that just won't let us be.

341
00:44:19,855 --> 00:44:21,049
Fuck that.
