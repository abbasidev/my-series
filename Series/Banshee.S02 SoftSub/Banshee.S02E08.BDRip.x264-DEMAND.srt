1
00:00:20,265 --> 00:00:21,905
I thought you said
you disabled the alarm.

2
00:00:21,967 --> 00:00:22,967
I did, both of them.

3
00:00:23,135 --> 00:00:24,932
But I didn't think you'd take so long
to open the goddamn safe.

4
00:00:25,137 --> 00:00:27,002
Are you gonna bitch about that now?

5
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:33,368
Ana, what the fuck?

6
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:39,017
Go. Get out of here.

7
00:00:46,024 --> 00:00:47,685
Hood! Hey!

8
00:00:47,893 --> 00:00:49,019
- Yeah?
- You got 'em?

9
00:00:49,227 --> 00:00:51,467
- No, no one came this way.
- They ran right towards you.

10
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,210
Shit, they must have doubled back.
Come on.

11
00:02:57,689 --> 00:02:59,054
So when did you two become a duo?

12
00:02:59,257 --> 00:03:01,191
- I needed the money.
- Yeah, we all need money.

13
00:03:01,393 --> 00:03:02,513
That's why we work together.

14
00:03:02,594 --> 00:03:04,323
It wasn't that kind of a job.

15
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,530
Oh.

16
00:03:09,267 --> 00:03:10,529
Oh, okay.

17
00:03:10,735 --> 00:03:12,600
Not that kind of job.

18
00:03:12,804 --> 00:03:14,533
You need to tell me
when you're out there.

19
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:16,819
- I don't need your permission.
- You do around here.

20
00:03:16,975 --> 00:03:18,499
What if it had been
one of my deputies that found you?

21
00:03:18,643 --> 00:03:19,667
- Your deputies?
- Yeah.

22
00:03:19,845 --> 00:03:20,965
Jesus. Do you hear yourself?

23
00:03:21,113 --> 00:03:22,774
It was a big risk for a small take.

24
00:03:22,981 --> 00:03:25,347
- It was fucking stupid.
- I needed the money for Max.

25
00:03:36,261 --> 00:03:37,956
Look, I could have helped.

26
00:03:59,151 --> 00:04:00,751
I've already agreed
to using your vendors

27
00:04:00,785 --> 00:04:03,345
and your administrative fee,
but 5% of the floor, that's out...

28
00:04:03,555 --> 00:04:06,285
That is the figure
your father and I agreed on.

29
00:04:06,491 --> 00:04:09,289
If you don't think I'm earning it,
we can rethink it.

30
00:04:09,494 --> 00:04:11,826
I don't know how I'm gonna hide
something like that in the books.

31
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,191
We'll figure something out.
You'll find me to be very flexible.

32
00:04:14,399 --> 00:04:15,599
Well, you're gonna have to be.

33
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,634
We should schedule a weekly meeting.

34
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,101
Okay.

35
00:04:37,155 --> 00:04:38,782
You were saying about the warehouse?

36
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,550
Cell phone detonator. Homemade.

37
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,751
- And the shipment?
- No.

38
00:04:56,241 --> 00:04:57,333
Sorry.

39
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:02,713
Our associates in Philadelphia...

40
00:05:06,818 --> 00:05:08,945
Rebecca, come in. Sit down.

41
00:05:18,964 --> 00:05:21,524
Our associates in Philadelphia...

42
00:05:22,801 --> 00:05:24,996
Are expecting delivery today.

43
00:05:25,203 --> 00:05:27,501
You call them and tell them
we'll make it up to them.

44
00:05:27,706 --> 00:05:29,401
What happened?

45
00:05:29,608 --> 00:05:32,304
An explosion
at our manufacturing facility.

46
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,375
- Someone planted a bomb.
- Who would do that?

47
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:36,206
It was Hood.
He's making a statement.

48
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:38,575
What are you gonna do?

49
00:05:38,717 --> 00:05:39,877
Nothing for now.

50
00:05:40,085 --> 00:05:42,417
- There's something else.
- What?

51
00:05:42,587 --> 00:05:44,427
The slaughterhouse
lost power over the weekend.

52
00:05:44,522 --> 00:05:47,548
- We have a backup generator.
- It was disabled.

53
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,227
All of the meat has gone bad.

54
00:05:50,428 --> 00:05:51,554
How's that possible?

55
00:05:51,763 --> 00:05:53,043
I spoke to the electric company.

56
00:05:53,231 --> 00:05:54,755
Someone hacked their server

57
00:05:54,966 --> 00:05:57,400
and shut down that particular grid.

58
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,935
He's got to be fucking kidding me.

59
00:07:03,101 --> 00:07:06,764
You know, there's a saying
in the restaurant business.

60
00:07:06,971 --> 00:07:08,700
Don't buy your meat

61
00:07:08,907 --> 00:07:10,772
where you buy your bread and butter.

62
00:07:10,909 --> 00:07:11,967
Trying to say don't shit
where you eat?

63
00:07:12,177 --> 00:07:13,610
Yeah.

64
00:07:15,413 --> 00:07:17,779
Why didn't you just say that, then?

65
00:07:17,982 --> 00:07:19,415
It lacks poetry.

66
00:07:26,591 --> 00:07:27,956
Morning, Kai.

67
00:07:30,929 --> 00:07:33,397
The club I can understand.

68
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:36,158
If my employees were involved
in illicit activities,

69
00:07:36,368 --> 00:07:38,962
you are compelled to act, sure.

70
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:41,730
- Even the warehouse.
- Yeah, I heard about that.

71
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,374
Explosion or something, right?

72
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:48,370
Now I've got a slaughterhouse
filled with rotten product.

73
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,672
Are you accusing me of something?

74
00:07:49,881 --> 00:07:51,473
What can you possibly gain
by fucking with my meat?

75
00:07:51,683 --> 00:07:52,650
What the hell are you doing?

76
00:07:52,784 --> 00:07:54,615
Are you here to report a crime?

77
00:07:56,554 --> 00:07:59,182
'Cause if not, I'm kind of busy.

78
00:08:04,696 --> 00:08:06,721
- What the hell are you doing?
- Kai.

79
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,395
Easy.

80
00:08:19,411 --> 00:08:21,038
You and I have a very complicated
relationship...

81
00:08:21,179 --> 00:08:22,237
No.

82
00:08:26,017 --> 00:08:29,282
I'm a cop, you're a criminal.

83
00:08:41,332 --> 00:08:42,697
You disappoint me, Sugar.

84
00:08:42,901 --> 00:08:44,732
You should be keeping better company.

85
00:08:57,649 --> 00:09:00,812
Being your friend,
it should come with hazard pay.

86
00:09:04,489 --> 00:09:06,150
You know, he's right about one thing.

87
00:09:07,659 --> 00:09:09,183
All I'm doing is harassing him.

88
00:09:09,394 --> 00:09:13,296
Well, before you decide
to kick it up a notch,

89
00:09:13,498 --> 00:09:15,159
give me plenty of warning.

90
00:09:45,163 --> 00:09:46,926
Oh, crap.

91
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,233
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

92
00:09:50,969 --> 00:09:53,494
Doctor said for you
to take it easy, remember?

93
00:09:53,705 --> 00:09:55,764
- I'm okay.
- Yeah?

94
00:10:00,845 --> 00:10:02,369
Now, what is this?

95
00:10:04,549 --> 00:10:07,950
- Well, I think it's pretty cool.
- Thanks.

96
00:10:08,152 --> 00:10:10,780
I mean, that's major architecture.

97
00:10:10,989 --> 00:10:12,388
Good morning.

98
00:10:14,659 --> 00:10:17,127
- Don't forget your inhaler.
- Got it.

99
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:22,459
You're not going to work?

100
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:24,328
Took a couple of days off.

101
00:10:26,638 --> 00:10:28,538
What are you up to?

102
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,072
Just gonna go
cast my Father of the Year ballot.

103
00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:32,676
Deva, I know you're mad

104
00:10:32,877 --> 00:10:34,674
and I'm sorry
I haven't been around enough.

105
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,959
It was worse when you were.

106
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,480
Yeah, and there's no excuse for it.

107
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,017
You just need to be around, Dad.

108
00:10:44,222 --> 00:10:45,382
I know.

109
00:10:47,292 --> 00:10:49,055
And it wasn't...

110
00:10:51,663 --> 00:10:54,063
Look, it wasn't fair for me
to put you in that position,

111
00:10:54,265 --> 00:10:55,823
but I am very sorry, baby.

112
00:10:55,967 --> 00:10:57,958
I'm gonna do better, I promise.

113
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:13,744
I was gonna pick it up after work.

114
00:11:13,952 --> 00:11:16,079
I'll get it after my shift.

115
00:11:16,287 --> 00:11:19,484
Em, I'm pregnant, not an invalid.

116
00:11:19,691 --> 00:11:22,285
The package could weigh
20 or 30 pounds for all I know.

117
00:11:22,493 --> 00:11:24,688
Let a man do his wife a solid.

118
00:11:24,896 --> 00:11:26,523
I think we can handle it.

119
00:11:36,174 --> 00:11:37,368
Fuck me.

120
00:11:42,714 --> 00:11:44,079
Hey, you want to have some fun?

121
00:11:44,282 --> 00:11:47,080
He's gonna be the first Yawners
to make it to the NFL.

122
00:11:47,285 --> 00:11:48,285
Oh, really?

123
00:11:48,453 --> 00:11:51,286
What if he likes to
paint or dance ballet?

124
00:11:51,489 --> 00:11:53,116
He'll be a Renaissance man.

125
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,757
I should get back.

126
00:11:57,962 --> 00:11:58,962
Okay.

127
00:12:12,877 --> 00:12:14,401
We need to talk.

128
00:12:21,319 --> 00:12:22,959
You said
you were going to arrest Proctor.

129
00:12:23,154 --> 00:12:24,121
- I'm working on that.
- Jesus.

130
00:12:24,322 --> 00:12:25,346
Every day I think that he knows

131
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:26,787
I'm the one
who told you about the warehouse.

132
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:28,152
Hey, there's no way
he could know that was you.

133
00:12:28,359 --> 00:12:29,986
But right now
I need something more.

134
00:12:30,194 --> 00:12:32,788
I need something that
directly connects to him.

135
00:12:32,997 --> 00:12:34,225
I don't know anything else.

136
00:12:34,432 --> 00:12:35,899
You said you see him
three or four times a week.

137
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,591
He fucks me.
There's no pillow talk in that.

138
00:12:38,736 --> 00:12:40,465
Come on,
it doesn't have to be illegal.

139
00:12:40,672 --> 00:12:42,663
Just something unusual. Anything.

140
00:12:47,211 --> 00:12:49,202
One night I was leaving
his house really late

141
00:12:49,313 --> 00:12:51,474
and I saw all these guys moving
a bunch of crates into his basement.

142
00:12:51,683 --> 00:12:53,283
- What was in the crates?
- I don't know.

143
00:12:53,451 --> 00:12:54,571
Did you see in the basement?

144
00:12:54,619 --> 00:12:55,899
He doesn't let me wander around.

145
00:12:55,987 --> 00:12:57,113
I need to know
what's in that basement.

146
00:12:57,321 --> 00:12:59,152
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- We don't want you to do anything

147
00:12:59,323 --> 00:13:00,847
that puts you in danger.

148
00:13:01,059 --> 00:13:03,289
Just talking to you
puts me in danger.

149
00:13:04,629 --> 00:13:06,290
Just leave.

150
00:13:06,497 --> 00:13:07,589
Please.

151
00:13:09,033 --> 00:13:10,159
You pushed her too hard.

152
00:13:10,368 --> 00:13:11,733
Right now she's all we've got.

153
00:13:13,771 --> 00:13:14,771
Fuck.

154
00:13:14,939 --> 00:13:16,899
No one wants to see Proctor go down
more than her.

155
00:13:16,974 --> 00:13:18,965
Well, moving crates into
a basement isn't a crime.

156
00:13:19,177 --> 00:13:20,974
- Depends on what's in the crates.
- That's not enough for a warrant.

157
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:23,443
And without a warrant,
you can't go in there.

158
00:13:23,648 --> 00:13:25,240
- Boss.
- What? I know.

159
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,441
- Do you?
- Yes.

160
00:13:27,652 --> 00:13:29,381
Here's his ditzy bitch.

161
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:33,484
- Hey.
- Hi.

162
00:13:33,691 --> 00:13:36,717
- Can I ask you a quick question?
- Sure.

163
00:13:37,962 --> 00:13:40,055
When did you become
a traitor to your race?

164
00:13:42,934 --> 00:13:44,799
Get out of my way.

165
00:13:45,002 --> 00:13:46,962
- Oh, no. Oh, no, look at that.
- Excuse me, guys.

166
00:13:47,105 --> 00:13:49,505
Don't tell me
this is a half coon baby in here.

167
00:13:49,707 --> 00:13:50,707
Ooh!

168
00:14:03,888 --> 00:14:06,322
What the fuck are you doing, man?

169
00:14:06,524 --> 00:14:07,957
Come on, let's go.

170
00:14:16,667 --> 00:14:18,828
- Somebody call 911.
- Hurry.

171
00:14:24,242 --> 00:14:25,266
Come in.

172
00:14:28,713 --> 00:14:31,079
That boy at the motel,
did he tell you his name?

173
00:14:31,282 --> 00:14:33,079
- He just said Jason.
- Jason.

174
00:14:33,284 --> 00:14:35,252
He didn't say anything about himself,
did he?

175
00:14:35,453 --> 00:14:36,886
No.

176
00:14:39,056 --> 00:14:41,547
It's just because
I don't understand why...

177
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:44,523
Hood cares so much about
what happened to him.

178
00:14:44,729 --> 00:14:46,287
I mean, it's, well...

179
00:14:48,099 --> 00:14:49,099
What are you going to do?

180
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,097
- About Hood?
- Yeah.

181
00:14:51,302 --> 00:14:54,396
He's acting out of desperation
because he has nothing

182
00:14:54,605 --> 00:14:58,041
and he's trying to provoke
an equally desperate response.

183
00:14:58,242 --> 00:15:00,472
What about all that money you lost?

184
00:15:00,678 --> 00:15:01,804
You know, I'm taking a longer view.

185
00:15:02,013 --> 00:15:05,005
Those losses are nothing compared to
what we'll make with Longshadow.

186
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:06,741
And I can’t jeopardize
that arrangement

187
00:15:06,851 --> 00:15:09,285
over a personal vendetta with Hood.

188
00:15:09,487 --> 00:15:11,182
No matter how much I'd like to.

189
00:15:14,192 --> 00:15:16,786
And I can't believe you have
so much restraint.

190
00:15:38,216 --> 00:15:40,377
Dr. Irvin to Orthopedics.

191
00:15:40,585 --> 00:15:42,815
Dr. Irvin to Orthopedics.

192
00:15:45,356 --> 00:15:47,187
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

193
00:15:47,391 --> 00:15:48,983
- Excuse me.
- Megan, honey. It's Emmett. I'm here.

194
00:15:49,193 --> 00:15:51,252
- Sir.
- It hurts.

195
00:15:51,462 --> 00:15:52,190
What's happening?
Where are you taking her?

196
00:15:52,396 --> 00:15:54,125
- Doctor's right here.
- I'm Dr. Holland.

197
00:15:54,332 --> 00:15:56,960
She's bleeding internally.
We're prepping her for surgery.

198
00:15:57,168 --> 00:15:59,636
Okay, honey.
Baby, tell me what happened.

199
00:15:59,837 --> 00:16:01,498
There were these guys.

200
00:16:01,706 --> 00:16:03,435
They had shaved heads.

201
00:16:05,109 --> 00:16:07,236
Tattoos.

202
00:16:07,445 --> 00:16:10,141
- They know you.
- You need to stay here, sir.

203
00:16:10,348 --> 00:16:11,975
Emmett, I'm scared.

204
00:16:12,183 --> 00:16:14,845
Okay, all right. Okay, look,
I'm gonna be right here.

205
00:16:15,052 --> 00:16:18,112
- Emmett, I'm scared. I'm scared.
- Sir, I need you to stay here.

206
00:16:18,322 --> 00:16:19,550
It's gonna be okay.
I'm gonna be here.

207
00:16:19,757 --> 00:16:21,418
Sir, we have to go.

208
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:28,790
- Emmett.

209
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,968
Hey, what happened?

210
00:16:31,168 --> 00:16:34,433
Meg, they're taking her into surgery.

211
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,506
It's the driver
we shook down the other day.

212
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:39,676
- Sharp.
- The skinheads?

213
00:16:39,877 --> 00:16:40,877
Son of a bitch.

214
00:16:41,045 --> 00:16:42,137
I guess he wanted to
get some payback.

215
00:16:42,346 --> 00:16:43,986
- Fuck.
- Whoa, whoa. Where are you going?

216
00:16:44,181 --> 00:16:47,173
- To get Sharp.
- No, no, you stay here. We'll go.

217
00:16:47,385 --> 00:16:49,751
- Get the hell out of my way, Brock.
- Listen, Em.

218
00:16:49,954 --> 00:16:52,752
Emmett, Emmett.
Look at me. Look at me.

219
00:16:53,357 --> 00:16:55,552
Meg needs you here, okay?

220
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,924
- She needs you.
- Hey, we'll find them.

221
00:17:00,131 --> 00:17:02,531
I promise.
We're gonna find them.

222
00:17:05,102 --> 00:17:06,501
Okay?

223
00:17:08,639 --> 00:17:09,936
It's gonna be okay.

224
00:19:51,368 --> 00:19:53,802
- Who's your informant?
- It's confidential.

225
00:19:55,272 --> 00:19:57,399
- Will he testify?
- No.

226
00:19:58,642 --> 00:19:59,666
How do you know
you can trust him?

227
00:19:59,877 --> 00:20:02,557
Let's just say he has a good reason
to want to see Proctor put away.

228
00:20:05,783 --> 00:20:08,411
As long as that reason
wasn't your gun in his face.

229
00:20:11,188 --> 00:20:14,055
I think you got the wrong idea
about me, Ms. Medding.

230
00:20:25,336 --> 00:20:27,770
You are hardly the first cowboy cop
I've ever dealt with.

231
00:20:27,972 --> 00:20:30,304
You all smile, play the game,

232
00:20:30,508 --> 00:20:32,028
but you'd really
rather just shoot first

233
00:20:32,143 --> 00:20:33,201
and ask questions never.

234
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,435
And here I was thinking we were just
starting to hit it off.

235
00:20:35,646 --> 00:20:36,646
From what I understand,

236
00:20:36,814 --> 00:20:38,814
you've been down this road
before with Kai Proctor.

237
00:20:38,816 --> 00:20:40,943
If I'm gonna get a search warrant,
it needs to be bulletproof.

238
00:20:41,152 --> 00:20:43,177
No judge will issue one on hearsay.

239
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:50,552
My informant saw the guns being moved
into the basement.

240
00:20:59,737 --> 00:21:01,864
- She's got soft hands.
- Shut your mouth.

241
00:21:02,072 --> 00:21:03,403
What's going on?

242
00:21:03,607 --> 00:21:05,040
Meg's in the hospital.

243
00:21:05,242 --> 00:21:07,301
- What?
- They were getting even with Emmett.

244
00:21:08,812 --> 00:21:11,303
- She assaulted me, Sheriff.
- Yeah, I witnessed it.

245
00:21:11,515 --> 00:21:12,914
I was defenseless.

246
00:21:14,151 --> 00:21:15,618
Is she okay?

247
00:21:15,819 --> 00:21:16,819
She was in surgery.

248
00:21:16,987 --> 00:21:18,545
We've been looking for
these assholes all night.

249
00:21:18,756 --> 00:21:21,816
- I sure hope she's okay.
- Shut the fuck up!

250
00:21:22,026 --> 00:21:23,618
Shut it!

251
00:21:23,827 --> 00:21:25,317
We were gonna head
to the hospital after this.

252
00:21:25,529 --> 00:21:27,019
It's gonna have to wait.

253
00:21:27,231 --> 00:21:29,071
I need you both
after you're done booking them.

254
00:21:29,233 --> 00:21:30,666
Why? What's up?

255
00:21:31,902 --> 00:21:33,494
Got a warrant to search Proctor's.

256
00:21:35,339 --> 00:21:36,670
Fuck!

257
00:21:38,709 --> 00:21:41,769
I want to go over
potential sites for a new lab.

258
00:21:43,013 --> 00:21:45,072
- I'll call you back.
- Kai Proctor.

259
00:21:45,282 --> 00:21:46,962
We have a warrant
to search these premises.

260
00:21:47,051 --> 00:21:48,575
- On what grounds?
- It's all in here.

261
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,087
Maybe I didn't make myself clear.

262
00:21:51,288 --> 00:21:53,483
Oh, no, no. You made yourself
perfectly clear.

263
00:22:01,365 --> 00:22:03,356
You got anything
you want to say to me?

264
00:22:04,668 --> 00:22:08,069
I'll make sure the DA's office
takes your cooperation into account.

265
00:22:09,807 --> 00:22:11,767
I don't know what it is
you hope to find, Sheriff.

266
00:22:11,775 --> 00:22:13,675
So that's a no?

267
00:22:15,379 --> 00:22:17,939
Okay. You mind if I look around?

268
00:22:18,148 --> 00:22:19,172
Thanks.

269
00:22:30,861 --> 00:22:32,351
Wait a minute. What's that?

270
00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:36,857
What's that sound like?

271
00:22:38,535 --> 00:22:39,832
See, to me...

272
00:22:41,272 --> 00:22:43,137
That sounds like...

273
00:22:44,642 --> 00:22:46,234
A door.

274
00:22:46,443 --> 00:22:48,570
- Bastard! I'll fucking kill you!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

275
00:22:48,779 --> 00:22:49,979
I'm going to fucking kill you!

276
00:22:51,782 --> 00:22:53,181
Easy, Kai.

277
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:56,616
This is not changing anything.

278
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,947
I think it might.

279
00:22:59,156 --> 00:23:00,646
- Wow.
- What's in there?

280
00:23:01,692 --> 00:23:04,286
I'm guessing this wasn't
on the original floor plan, right?

281
00:23:04,495 --> 00:23:06,986
You have permits
for all these illegal guns?

282
00:23:10,501 --> 00:23:11,661
He asked you a question.

283
00:23:11,869 --> 00:23:12,995
Fuck you.

284
00:23:13,203 --> 00:23:14,963
- Take that as a no.
- I'll fucking kill you.

285
00:23:15,105 --> 00:23:17,403
Kai Proctor, you're under arrest.

286
00:23:17,608 --> 00:23:19,608
- You have the right...
- I know my fucking rights!

287
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:21,976
Yeah, okay, but let me
have my moment, all right?

288
00:23:22,179 --> 00:23:24,010
Kai Proctor, you are under arrest.

289
00:23:24,214 --> 00:23:25,806
You have the right to remain silent.

290
00:23:26,016 --> 00:23:28,816
Anything you do say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

291
00:23:29,019 --> 00:23:31,487
Now, you have the right
to an attorney.

292
00:23:31,689 --> 00:23:32,849
If you can't afford an attorney,
the court,

293
00:23:33,057 --> 00:23:34,354
they'll appoint one for you.

294
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:36,549
- You're fucking dead.
- Take him away.

295
00:23:42,633 --> 00:23:45,295
All right,
let's get the guns and anything else.

296
00:23:48,172 --> 00:23:49,400
Sure.

297
00:23:56,513 --> 00:23:59,209
Well, the internal bleeding
was a lot worse than we thought.

298
00:23:59,416 --> 00:24:01,407
But she's gonna be okay?

299
00:24:01,618 --> 00:24:02,812
We're gonna watch her,

300
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,885
make sure that her pressure
doesn't drop again,

301
00:24:05,089 --> 00:24:07,114
but, yes, she's going to be okay.

302
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:14,124
But the trauma was too great
for the fetus.

303
00:24:17,568 --> 00:24:18,796
What?

304
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,637
We'll run down the guns.

305
00:24:24,842 --> 00:24:27,162
If we're lucky, one of them
has been used in a major crime.

306
00:24:27,211 --> 00:24:29,475
- If not?
- None of the guns are registered.

307
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,079
We've already got him
on illegal possession.

308
00:24:31,281 --> 00:24:32,281
That is a major offense,

309
00:24:32,483 --> 00:24:34,974
especially
if there was gun trafficking.

310
00:24:35,185 --> 00:24:36,948
How long can you keep him in county?

311
00:24:37,154 --> 00:24:38,554
Long enough to try and make a case.

312
00:24:38,756 --> 00:24:39,745
I want to go over
the warrant again.

313
00:24:39,957 --> 00:24:40,855
We've been over that already.

314
00:24:41,058 --> 00:24:42,184
Well, now you're gonna
go over it with me.

315
00:24:42,393 --> 00:24:44,233
If you're gonna be late to the party,
Gordon...

316
00:24:44,261 --> 00:24:46,491
Did you not get the fucking memo?
I'm still your boss.

317
00:24:46,697 --> 00:24:48,961
Proctor's not gonna
beat the warrant, end of story.

318
00:24:49,166 --> 00:24:50,463
I've faced Proctor in court.

319
00:24:50,667 --> 00:24:52,507
- He's got a good lawyer.
- Yeah, now so do we.

320
00:24:54,805 --> 00:24:56,125
You want to fuck with me on this?

321
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,860
Do I step out
so you can measure your dicks?

322
00:25:01,678 --> 00:25:03,198
The feds will be by
to pick up the guns

323
00:25:03,347 --> 00:25:04,427
first thing in the morning.

324
00:25:04,515 --> 00:25:06,676
Until then, thank you
for your time, Sheriff.

325
00:25:17,494 --> 00:25:19,553
Guess everyone needs a hobby, huh?

326
00:25:19,763 --> 00:25:23,494
Stamps, that's a hobby.
This is psychotic.

327
00:25:26,503 --> 00:25:28,232
So, how'd it go with the ADA?

328
00:25:28,439 --> 00:25:29,838
Good.

329
00:25:30,607 --> 00:25:32,370
She thinks we have a strong case.

330
00:25:33,811 --> 00:25:37,440
Well, hopefully
it'll hold up this time.

331
00:25:37,648 --> 00:25:40,139
Hey, I wanted to ask you.

332
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:42,011
Who tipped you off on the guns?

333
00:25:42,219 --> 00:25:44,050
Confidential informant, Brock.

334
00:25:44,254 --> 00:25:46,882
Not that I don't trust you.
Any word on Emmett?

335
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:49,718
I left a couple messages.

336
00:25:49,927 --> 00:25:52,293
Okay, I'm gonna head over
to the hospital, check in.

337
00:25:52,496 --> 00:25:53,520
Great.

338
00:25:58,001 --> 00:25:59,559
You know what we haven't talked about
in a while?

339
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:02,068
- What's that?
- Him.

340
00:26:02,272 --> 00:26:04,399
Sheriff Lucas Hood.

341
00:26:04,608 --> 00:26:07,168
When he first got here,
he did whatever the hell he wanted.

342
00:26:07,377 --> 00:26:09,641
We were all so shocked.
And now, all of a sudden,

343
00:26:09,847 --> 00:26:12,873
he's Mr. Johnny By-the-book.

344
00:26:13,083 --> 00:26:16,143
I guess better late than never, huh?

345
00:26:16,353 --> 00:26:17,820
I guess.

346
00:26:18,021 --> 00:26:20,046
He tell you who his informant is?

347
00:26:20,257 --> 00:26:22,282
Why would he tell me and not you?

348
00:26:22,493 --> 00:26:25,690
I don't know.
You two seem pretty close.

349
00:26:28,165 --> 00:26:29,165
I'm sorry?

350
00:26:29,366 --> 00:26:31,425
No, I'm...

351
00:26:31,635 --> 00:26:32,915
Come on, Siobhan. I'm not blind.

352
00:26:33,036 --> 00:26:35,027
I see things, you know?

353
00:26:35,239 --> 00:26:37,366
I'm assuming you two are probably
sleeping together at this point.

354
00:26:37,574 --> 00:26:39,201
You want to tell me about it?

355
00:26:41,812 --> 00:26:43,780
There's nothing to talk about, Brock.

356
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:47,610
Oh, fuck.

357
00:26:47,818 --> 00:26:50,082
Go fish.

358
00:26:50,287 --> 00:26:52,278
Hey, you want a burger
or a hot dog?

359
00:26:52,489 --> 00:26:54,047
- Uh, both.
- Okay.

360
00:26:54,258 --> 00:26:57,022
- How about you, Deva?
- I'll take a burger, please.

361
00:26:57,227 --> 00:26:59,559
Hey, yo! Stop. You're cheating.

362
00:26:59,763 --> 00:27:01,628
Put that back.
That's not how we play. Come on.

363
00:27:11,408 --> 00:27:12,966
Goddammit.

364
00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:16,803
Carrie.

365
00:27:21,084 --> 00:27:22,711
If you want to know, I'll tell you.

366
00:27:23,987 --> 00:27:25,352
But you really don't want to know.

367
00:27:25,556 --> 00:27:26,921
Carrie, wait.

368
00:27:37,768 --> 00:27:39,759
Look, why don't you stay for dinner?

369
00:27:40,904 --> 00:27:43,532
The problem is
this new ADA Medding.

370
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:46,436
She's smart.
And from everything I've heard,

371
00:27:46,643 --> 00:27:47,905
she is not open for business.

372
00:27:48,111 --> 00:27:49,271
Everyone has a price.

373
00:27:49,479 --> 00:27:52,414
You want to add attempted bribery
on top of the gun charges?

374
00:27:52,616 --> 00:27:54,641
Everyone has a weakness.

375
00:27:54,851 --> 00:27:58,617
Anyway, our best shot is
to attack the search warrant.

376
00:27:58,822 --> 00:28:01,552
We attack the veracity of their
confidential informant's claim.

377
00:28:01,758 --> 00:28:02,782
Which was?

378
00:28:02,993 --> 00:28:06,121
Their CI claims to have seen guns
in your basement.

379
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:08,457
That was the basis
for obtaining a warrant.

380
00:28:08,665 --> 00:28:09,962
- Impossible.
- Is it?

381
00:28:10,167 --> 00:28:11,464
No one knew about that room.

382
00:28:11,668 --> 00:28:14,068
No one could have possibly seen
what was inside of it.

383
00:28:14,271 --> 00:28:15,738
Rebecca and Burton
are the only other people

384
00:28:15,939 --> 00:28:16,997
with access to my home.

385
00:28:17,207 --> 00:28:18,674
- Is there anyone else?
- No.

386
00:28:18,875 --> 00:28:21,173
Think. If we knew who the CI is,

387
00:28:21,378 --> 00:28:22,902
maybe we can discount the warrant.

388
00:28:23,113 --> 00:28:24,546
Juliet.

389
00:28:27,451 --> 00:28:28,713
Who's Juliet?

390
00:28:34,391 --> 00:28:36,689
I'm going to step outside
for a minute.

391
00:28:50,674 --> 00:28:52,266
Take care of the girl.

392
00:29:20,203 --> 00:29:21,670
How is she?

393
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,704
Doctor says she's gonna be fine.

394
00:29:27,644 --> 00:29:28,941
That's good.

395
00:29:32,516 --> 00:29:34,313
Siobhan and Brock,

396
00:29:34,518 --> 00:29:37,078
they got Sharp and his buddies.

397
00:29:37,287 --> 00:29:38,777
They're in holding right now.

398
00:29:45,262 --> 00:29:46,820
They're not gonna
get away with this.

399
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,897
Okay.

400
00:29:55,205 --> 00:29:56,900
Yeah.

401
00:29:57,107 --> 00:29:58,165
Thanks.

402
00:30:00,243 --> 00:30:01,471
Yeah.

403
00:30:03,647 --> 00:30:05,581
Yeah, we also arrested Proctor.

404
00:30:07,417 --> 00:30:09,009
For what?

405
00:30:11,755 --> 00:30:13,586
Assault weapons, but...

406
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:16,918
It doesn't really matter right now.

407
00:30:21,898 --> 00:30:23,365
Emmett.

408
00:30:42,886 --> 00:30:44,911
- Hi.
- Hi.

409
00:30:47,157 --> 00:30:49,057
Doctor says you're gonna be fine.

410
00:30:56,266 --> 00:30:58,234
I lost the baby.

411
00:31:07,544 --> 00:31:09,569
It's gonna be okay.

412
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,247
Okay?

413
00:31:11,448 --> 00:31:13,439
You just need to get some rest.

414
00:31:14,417 --> 00:31:17,284
It's gonna be all right.

415
00:31:17,487 --> 00:31:18,715
Emmett.

416
00:31:18,922 --> 00:31:20,890
What are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be at the hospital?

417
00:31:21,091 --> 00:31:23,025
- Meg is sleeping.
- How is she?

418
00:31:23,226 --> 00:31:25,091
- She's gonna be fine.
- Thank God.

419
00:31:25,295 --> 00:31:27,320
You can't still be on duty
tonight.

420
00:31:27,531 --> 00:31:29,431
No, I already called Brock
to cover.

421
00:31:32,369 --> 00:31:35,736
This is a test. That's all.

422
00:31:37,774 --> 00:31:39,207
You're right.

423
00:31:39,409 --> 00:31:42,037
Okay, well, I'll wait for Brock.
You get back to Meg.

424
00:31:42,245 --> 00:31:44,406
He's gonna be here in,
like, five minutes.

425
00:31:45,715 --> 00:31:47,080
It's fine.

426
00:31:47,284 --> 00:31:50,617
Just try to get some rest,
sweetheart.

427
00:31:58,595 --> 00:32:00,460
It's gonna be okay.

428
00:32:01,865 --> 00:32:03,457
Promise.

429
00:32:13,143 --> 00:32:14,235
- All right.
- All right.

430
00:32:14,444 --> 00:32:16,969
- Well, you have a good night.
- You, too.

431
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:20,741
And you tell Meg that
I will be praying for her.

432
00:32:20,951 --> 00:32:22,179
I will.

433
00:32:22,385 --> 00:32:24,512
- All right.
- Thank you.

434
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,111
Just a test.

435
00:32:55,151 --> 00:32:58,211
Cheryl, I'm going to need
the other thing as well.

436
00:32:58,421 --> 00:33:00,355
I think she must have stepped out.

437
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,160
Sheriff Hood.

438
00:33:05,362 --> 00:33:06,362
How can I help you?

439
00:33:06,529 --> 00:33:07,928
Well, I don't know if you heard,

440
00:33:08,131 --> 00:33:09,894
but we arrested
Kai Proctor last night.

441
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,261
Possession of illegal firearms.

442
00:33:12,469 --> 00:33:14,709
- What does that have to do with me?
- Nothing I know of.

443
00:33:14,905 --> 00:33:17,032
But I am curious

444
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:20,732
why Proctor would have so much
information on the Kinaho casino.

445
00:33:20,944 --> 00:33:23,640
I mean, that is a lot of information

446
00:33:23,847 --> 00:33:25,747
to have about
someone else's business.

447
00:33:25,949 --> 00:33:29,043
Don't you think?
So I started wondering,

448
00:33:29,252 --> 00:33:33,382
maybe everything going on
between you and him lately,

449
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:37,356
maybe you have a little more to do
with him than I know.

450
00:33:38,461 --> 00:33:40,486
Do I need to call my lawyer?

451
00:33:40,697 --> 00:33:42,255
I know you'd never intentionally

452
00:33:42,465 --> 00:33:44,092
risk the well-being
of your tribe by getting in bed

453
00:33:44,301 --> 00:33:45,734
with someone like Proctor.

454
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:49,900
So I'd like to help you
get him out of your business.

455
00:33:51,474 --> 00:33:53,942
And why would you do that, Sheriff?

456
00:33:54,144 --> 00:33:56,635
We have a case against him
with these guns.

457
00:33:56,846 --> 00:33:58,575
It might stick.

458
00:33:58,782 --> 00:34:01,774
But if it doesn't,
I want some insurance.

459
00:34:06,056 --> 00:34:07,455
And what do I get out of it?

460
00:34:09,526 --> 00:34:10,686
Same thing I get.

461
00:34:12,295 --> 00:34:14,126
Same thing this whole town gets.

462
00:34:28,378 --> 00:34:32,747
My father had certain
dealings with Kai Proctor.

463
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:36,077
Extortion rackets for land grabs.

464
00:34:36,286 --> 00:34:38,006
I inherited those along with
everything else

465
00:34:38,021 --> 00:34:40,182
when my father passed.

466
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:42,051
He was a revered leader,

467
00:34:42,258 --> 00:34:45,591
so I hope you can understand

468
00:34:45,795 --> 00:34:47,160
why I didn't want to
bring these things to light.

469
00:34:47,364 --> 00:34:48,626
Of course.

470
00:34:49,733 --> 00:34:50,825
I understand that.

471
00:34:52,936 --> 00:34:55,996
But I think we've all
been living in the dark long enough.

472
00:34:56,206 --> 00:34:57,673
Yeah.

473
00:34:57,874 --> 00:34:59,307
I think so, too.

474
00:35:21,498 --> 00:35:24,296
I've been wondering when you'd
come around to pay us a visit.

475
00:35:28,671 --> 00:35:29,831
Look at him, boys.

476
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:36,144
That is one angry black man.

477
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:40,378
I guess we're lucky the bald guy
and the dyke caught us first.

478
00:35:40,583 --> 00:35:42,676
- You think so?
- Hey, I like the dyke.

479
00:35:46,856 --> 00:35:48,824
Do you know what I love
about this country?

480
00:35:50,493 --> 00:35:53,018
The same laws
that protect people from me,

481
00:35:53,229 --> 00:35:54,890
protect me from you.

482
00:35:56,132 --> 00:35:57,793
You sound like my father.

483
00:36:01,037 --> 00:36:02,504
I think that was an insult.

484
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:10,402
You see, my father believed
that the law spoke for all men,

485
00:36:10,613 --> 00:36:11,705
even a black janitor.

486
00:36:11,915 --> 00:36:13,746
You just have to have faith
in the system.

487
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:15,577
And he did.

488
00:36:15,785 --> 00:36:19,050
One day his boss cheats him
out of some wages,

489
00:36:19,255 --> 00:36:20,415
so he takes the guy to court.

490
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:23,150
The judge says, "Boy, don't bite
the hand that feeds you."

491
00:36:25,195 --> 00:36:27,425
- Pops gets fired.
- That's some judge.

492
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:29,564
Couple years later
he buys his first car.

493
00:36:29,766 --> 00:36:30,960
It gets stolen.

494
00:36:31,167 --> 00:36:34,193
So like any law-abiding citizen,
he goes to the police.

495
00:36:34,404 --> 00:36:37,168
They say, "Boy, don't you know
we got better things to do

496
00:36:37,373 --> 00:36:38,931
than to chase after
some nigger's car?"

497
00:36:41,211 --> 00:36:42,940
The point is, my father died

498
00:36:43,146 --> 00:36:45,740
without ever having
anyone to speak for him.

499
00:36:45,949 --> 00:36:47,780
That's touching.

500
00:36:47,984 --> 00:36:49,781
I never wanted to be a cop.

501
00:36:50,987 --> 00:36:52,181
Just wanted to play football.

502
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:55,780
That didn't work out.

503
00:36:57,193 --> 00:37:00,754
Now, you guys got me realizing
the real reason I'm here

504
00:37:00,964 --> 00:37:03,084
is to speak for people
who can't speak for themselves.

505
00:37:03,133 --> 00:37:05,226
People like my father.

506
00:37:12,475 --> 00:37:15,035
And my baby boy
who you killed today.

507
00:37:19,282 --> 00:37:21,409
Fuck you, man.

508
00:37:21,618 --> 00:37:23,381
I ain't scared of you.

509
00:37:34,998 --> 00:37:36,090
What the hell is this?

510
00:37:36,299 --> 00:37:37,630
Relax.
He ain't gonna do shit.

511
00:37:37,834 --> 00:37:39,529
There's no one else here.

512
00:37:46,142 --> 00:37:47,370
You get past me...

513
00:37:48,678 --> 00:37:50,646
And you're home free.

514
00:37:50,847 --> 00:37:52,610
Oh, I'm gonna fuck you up, spook.

515
00:37:55,718 --> 00:37:57,310
Help him, asshole!

516
00:37:59,556 --> 00:38:00,887
Take him out, Curtis.

517
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:02,523
Nighty-night.

518
00:38:02,725 --> 00:38:04,818
Come on,
he's going down. You got him.

519
00:38:05,028 --> 00:38:06,689
Go night-night.

520
00:38:06,896 --> 00:38:09,694
- You got him.
- Night-night.

521
00:38:09,899 --> 00:38:11,560
He's going down.

522
00:38:20,543 --> 00:38:22,010
He's had enough.

523
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,540
What did you say?

524
00:38:25,748 --> 00:38:27,340
I said he's had enough!

525
00:38:38,461 --> 00:38:40,053
You know how you feel right now?

526
00:38:41,798 --> 00:38:43,231
That rage that you're feeling?

527
00:38:45,268 --> 00:38:46,895
That keeps building inside you

528
00:38:47,103 --> 00:38:50,004
because somebody touched
someone you love.

529
00:38:53,309 --> 00:38:55,402
I feel that rage every day...

530
00:38:56,679 --> 00:38:59,273
When I see you and your people...

531
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:02,375
Overrunning this country.

532
00:39:02,585 --> 00:39:04,917
It makes people feel better
to say we're ignorant,

533
00:39:05,121 --> 00:39:07,715
but I see exactly what's going on.

534
00:39:07,924 --> 00:39:09,289
I'm not ignorant.

535
00:39:11,594 --> 00:39:13,186
And I'm not sorry.

536
00:39:18,067 --> 00:39:19,762
Same deal.

537
00:39:19,969 --> 00:39:21,766
You get past me,

538
00:39:21,971 --> 00:39:23,529
you're home free.

539
00:41:43,312 --> 00:41:45,032
You know,
if you're gonna be here this late,

540
00:41:45,148 --> 00:41:47,844
feel free to pick up
a mop and a broom.

541
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:50,518
Tables can never be too clean.

542
00:41:54,357 --> 00:41:55,619
Shit.

543
00:41:56,826 --> 00:41:58,657
I got you, motherfucker.

544
00:41:58,861 --> 00:42:00,658
What?

545
00:42:00,863 --> 00:42:02,660
- Got who?
- Rabbit.

546
00:42:02,865 --> 00:42:04,765
- I got him.
- How?

547
00:42:04,967 --> 00:42:08,164
FBI followed protocol and digitized
all of Agent Racine's files.

548
00:42:08,371 --> 00:42:09,411
It was a shot in the dark,

549
00:42:09,539 --> 00:42:11,419
but I found an old exploit
from a legacy system.

550
00:42:13,342 --> 00:42:14,866
I used the computer.

551
00:42:15,011 --> 00:42:16,535
Yeah, right.

552
00:42:16,746 --> 00:42:18,441
Racine found Rabbit?

553
00:42:18,648 --> 00:42:22,106
Yes, he did.
He just didn't know it.

554
00:42:22,318 --> 00:42:23,580
But I do.

555
00:42:25,288 --> 00:42:26,778
Kind of wish you didn't.

556
00:42:32,395 --> 00:42:33,919
Hey.

557
00:42:43,573 --> 00:42:45,905
- I was hoping you'd still be up.
- I'm up.

558
00:42:51,414 --> 00:42:53,109
Listen, I just wanted to explain...

559
00:42:53,316 --> 00:42:54,578
What, about the fact that
you got an illegal search warrant

560
00:42:54,784 --> 00:42:55,784
for Proctor's arrest?

561
00:42:55,952 --> 00:42:57,214
I wouldn't put it quite like that, but...

562
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:59,140
Juliet never said
anything about those guns.

563
00:42:59,222 --> 00:43:01,247
- You lied to get that warrant.
- But I ended up being right...

564
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:03,654
- Look, that is not the point.
- What's the point, then?

565
00:43:03,826 --> 00:43:06,066
That's not the point.
You know what Proctor's capable of.

566
00:43:06,095 --> 00:43:07,426
You put that woman's life
on the line.

567
00:43:07,563 --> 00:43:08,563
Oh, come on.

568
00:43:08,764 --> 00:43:10,356
Not to mention my career.
But that's nothing new for you.

569
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,058
- Hey, I didn't ask you for anything.
- You already did.

570
00:43:12,268 --> 00:43:14,964
The second you got that warrant,
you made me complicit in your lie.

571
00:43:15,938 --> 00:43:16,938
Yeah, but Proctor...

572
00:43:17,073 --> 00:43:18,973
I don't give a fuck about Proctor,
okay,

573
00:43:19,108 --> 00:43:21,076
or how you got him, but if you think
that sleeping with me

574
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:22,268
gets you my
unquestioning loyalty...

575
00:43:22,478 --> 00:43:24,518
- You know that's not what I think.
- How do I know?

576
00:43:26,382 --> 00:43:28,577
How do I know?
You never tell me anything.

577
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:36,390
I'll answer
any question you have.

578
00:43:39,028 --> 00:43:40,325
Right now.

579
00:43:59,782 --> 00:44:01,215
It's Brock.

580
00:44:02,752 --> 00:44:04,947
Oh, my God.

581
00:44:05,154 --> 00:44:06,951
Hey, Hood, over here.

582
00:44:07,156 --> 00:44:09,147
- Did you call for an ambulance?
- Yeah, they're on their way.

583
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:10,620
Fuck.

584
00:44:10,826 --> 00:44:12,817
They're alive.
I need more bandages.

585
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:37,981
Hey, Emmett, you want the EMT
to take a look at you?

586
00:44:39,088 --> 00:44:40,248
No.

587
00:44:43,159 --> 00:44:46,458
Two of the guys are mostly okay.

588
00:44:46,662 --> 00:44:48,789
A lot of broken bones
and concussions,

589
00:44:48,998 --> 00:44:52,297
but the one guy...

590
00:44:53,636 --> 00:44:55,968
Sharp, he's...

591
00:44:57,406 --> 00:44:58,930
He's pretty bad.

592
00:45:01,777 --> 00:45:02,971
Listen, Emmett...

593
00:45:04,513 --> 00:45:06,174
I think we need to
get your story straight

594
00:45:06,415 --> 00:45:08,406
- before we call you a lawyer.
- Hey, Brock.

595
00:45:08,618 --> 00:45:10,518
You leave us alone for a minute?

596
00:45:11,721 --> 00:45:12,721
Yeah.

597
00:45:14,423 --> 00:45:16,550
Hey, we're gonna figure this out.

598
00:45:30,306 --> 00:45:32,035
There's nothing to figure out.

599
00:45:43,653 --> 00:45:46,417
You were in an emotional state.

600
00:45:46,622 --> 00:45:49,614
Your wife, your baby.

601
00:45:49,825 --> 00:45:52,851
They taunted you, you snapped.

602
00:45:54,797 --> 00:45:56,237
You didn't know what you were doing.

603
00:45:56,298 --> 00:45:58,391
I knew exactly what I was doing.

604
00:46:03,606 --> 00:46:06,507
I've been dealing with guys
like Sharp my whole life.

605
00:46:07,576 --> 00:46:10,977
Maybe not as extreme as him,
but it's always something.

606
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:14,775
A look, a comment.

607
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:18,910
Something.

608
00:46:20,389 --> 00:46:23,017
You know,
you get real good at burying it

609
00:46:23,225 --> 00:46:25,250
and hiding it behind a smile.

610
00:46:28,664 --> 00:46:30,256
This, I couldn't let it go.

611
00:46:32,468 --> 00:46:33,958
I didn't want to.

612
00:46:38,007 --> 00:46:40,601
I've been following
His teachings for years.

613
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:43,142
Been turning the other cheek.

614
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,505
The thing about it
is if I could go back,

615
00:46:46,716 --> 00:46:49,276
I'd do the same thing
to those pieces of shit again.

616
00:46:49,485 --> 00:46:53,216
I'd do the same thing again and again,

617
00:46:53,422 --> 00:46:55,049
even though I know it's a sin.

618
00:46:58,294 --> 00:47:00,694
So what kind of Christian
does that make me?

619
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,733
You know, when Meg first told me
she was pregnant...

620
00:47:17,947 --> 00:47:19,414
My first thought...

621
00:47:20,549 --> 00:47:22,346
Was "How can we raise a kid here?"

622
00:47:26,655 --> 00:47:28,486
I mean, this town.

623
00:47:30,726 --> 00:47:32,887
It's like everything that's good

624
00:47:33,095 --> 00:47:34,995
just gets swallowed up by the bad.

625
00:47:38,801 --> 00:47:42,066
It's like a never-ending
cycle of shit.

626
00:47:50,012 --> 00:47:52,378
Guys like Sharp feel like they can
do whatever they want

627
00:47:52,581 --> 00:47:53,775
to whoever they want.

628
00:48:00,156 --> 00:48:02,818
And we're supposed to be
part of the solution.

629
00:48:05,728 --> 00:48:07,593
We're supposed to hold that line.

630
00:48:11,333 --> 00:48:13,062
But there is no line.

631
00:48:14,837 --> 00:48:16,065
Not here.

632
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:21,902
The Bible says,

633
00:48:22,111 --> 00:48:24,306
"See that no one
repays evil for evil."

634
00:48:29,752 --> 00:48:31,617
Sometimes repaying it
is all you've got.

635
00:48:37,159 --> 00:48:39,184
I got no problem with that.

636
00:48:43,232 --> 00:48:44,699
Hood.
