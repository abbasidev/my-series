1
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:11,967
I've been thinking.

2
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:16,509
It's probably time
for me to be moving on.

3
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:20,310
Where would you go?

4
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,817
What would you do?

5
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:25,019
Best thing I can do
for you is to leave.

6
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:31,321
Bad shit happens to people
standing too close to you.

7
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:43,142
The rules are different out here.

8
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:45,334
No, same rules.

9
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:48,446
Same rules they had since the first
man picked up the first stick

10
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:50,377
and beat the second man's ass
with it.

11
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:54,686
People like you and me,

12
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,480
we don't need bars.

13
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,749
We build our own cells.

14
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:07,126
Every time I think
I know the way forward,

15
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:10,394
something just kicks me
back on my ass.

16
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:13,573
I don't know what's coming next,
but it's coming.

17
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:48,124
Who the hell left this here?

18
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,394
It's not from around here,
I can tell you that.

19
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,845
Big shot thinks
he's got a fancy freakin' car

20
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:07,747
and he can block the pump.

21
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:10,081
It's like he's telling
the world he's hot shit.

22
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,192
Ooh-whee.

23
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,457
This is one fine-ass machine.

24
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:24,196
- I have to piss.
- Do it quickly.

25
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:25,803
We're on a schedule.

26
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,707
Must have cost a fucking fortune.

27
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:39,664
What's the matter?
It ain't gonna bite you.

28
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:57,026
My apologies, gentlemen.

29
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,829
I'll just get that out of your way.

30
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,700
Oh, shit. It's 007.

31
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,738
Nah, it's Austin Powers.

32
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:04,842
Well, 00-homo,
why don't you take your ride

33
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:06,808
and get back to
your own fucking country?

34
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:13,711
You know,
you shouldn't be smoking

35
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,115
at a petrol station.

36
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:19,721
Safety first, fun later.

37
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,723
Who the fuck do you think you are?

38
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:16,215
Fuck!

39
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:28,624
Alex Longshadow.
What brings you around?

40
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:35,366
Anything you want to say,
you can say in front of her.

41
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:37,695
George Hunter wants me out as chief.

42
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:39,705
And?

43
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:42,170
And they have the votes to unseat me.

44
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,502
Sounds to me you have
a real problem there.

45
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:47,805
If Hunter becomes chief, you can kiss
any piece of that casino good-bye.

46
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,174
Hunter won't let you near it.

47
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:52,410
Yeah, well, you always said
that you wouldn't either.

48
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:56,020
I'm young,
as you so enjoy pointing out.

49
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:57,746
My mind can change.

50
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:03,354
- Get me the list.
- List? What list?

51
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:06,123
Of the council members
who will vote against you.

52
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:10,028
- They meet next week.
- That's plenty of time.

53
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,602
- Okay. Thank you.
- No, don't thank me.

54
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:15,531
After all, we're partners.

55
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,285
Partners, yeah.

56
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:47,063
Hey.

57
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:49,673
The new you.

58
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,304
Passports, credit cards,
IDs, the works.

59
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,111
- Buddy, buddy, buddy!
- All right, all right.

60
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,843
Oh, man.

61
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:04,814
Just keep it safe, okay?

62
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:06,048
This is great.

63
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,489
- Don't fuck around with it.
- Thanks, man.

64
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:09,957
Don't thank me. Thank Job.

65
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,274
Sorry, friend.
We don't open till noon.

66
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:35,219
Gentlemen, I'll have
what my young friend Jason is having.

67
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:37,823
Hello, Jason.

68
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:42,225
Um, I said we're not open.

69
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,068
Where's the money, Jason?

70
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:53,239
I don't know what
you're talking about.

71
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,737
- You know who I am, right?
- Yeah.

72
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:58,670
Then you know I mean it
when I tell you

73
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:00,869
this is the last time
I'm going to ask.

74
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:04,122
Where's the fucking money?

75
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,842
Hey, Sugar.

76
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:08,816
Don't you have some sort
of house rule about guns?

77
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:11,957
- Yeah, no guns.
- Right.

78
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:14,616
You hear that, Clover?

79
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,624
No guns allowed.

80
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:17,829
Well, then,

81
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:20,464
I think we might have a problem.

82
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:35,107
Hey, Hood!

83
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,347
- You all right?
- Yeah.

84
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:56,162
What money?

85
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,965
Why is the casino
so important to you?

86
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:03,975
I mean, you've got
all these other businesses.

87
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:05,667
Just seems like a lot of trouble.

88
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,403
I have no illusions about what I am.

89
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:09,639
These other businesses,

90
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:12,147
they'll either kill me
or I die with them.

91
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:14,183
Either way, I leave nothing behind.

92
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,252
And since I have no children...

93
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,861
So the casino, being protected from
local law enforcement,

94
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,930
offers me the shelter I need
to do something legitimate.

95
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:30,068
You know, something that
will live on when I'm gone.

96
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:34,866
Now do you understand?

97
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,707
Yeah.

98
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:39,911
Go on.

99
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,842
Sheriff Hood and I
were having coffee

100
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:44,278
when this one guy chases
the other guy through the door.

101
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:46,244
Have you ever seen
either one of them before?

102
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:49,617
Never. They were arguing
with each other.

103
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:51,289
Deputy.

104
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:53,789
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

105
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:57,292
See, the one guy,
he had a thick British accent.

106
00:09:58,498 --> 00:09:59,522
Who fired first?

107
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:01,529
You know, you really got to start
taking better care of yourself.

108
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:03,463
I'm still in one piece.

109
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:08,432
But the day's just started
and the shooter's still out there.

110
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:13,406
Hey, I'm fine.

111
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,613
Okay?

112
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,075
We got an alert out for his car.
A red Jag, right?

113
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:20,142
Yeah. Yeah, should be
easy enough to spot.

114
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,048
Holy shit.

115
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:24,156
Uh-huh.

116
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,806
Is it just me,
or does it seem like every scumbag

117
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:31,761
with an automatic weapon
comes to Banshee to shoot you?

118
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,194
- No, it's just you.
- Huh.

119
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,400
You all right?

120
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,661
Yeah, thanks for asking.

121
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,837
Did you get a good look
at him, Sheriff?

122
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:40,005
- Good enough.
- Yeah, 'cause you just

123
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:41,639
happened to be here
when the shooting started, right?

124
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:45,504
- Yeah, I live here.
- Yeah, I guess that much is true.

125
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:49,247
What?

126
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,855
Maybe now's not the best time
to give the sheriff a hard time.

127
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:54,580
- I mean, he just got shot at.
- Come on, Emmett.

128
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:57,312
You don't wonder why this shit
keeps happening with him?

129
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:59,354
Sure, I do.
But you know he's still the boss.

130
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:01,584
So you don't question
anything that he does, huh?

131
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:03,056
Maybe that's the difference
between us.

132
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:05,389
No, the difference between us is
you still haven't wrapped your mind

133
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,532
around the fact that he's in charge.

134
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:16,202
What I want to know is
who's gonna pay for this stuff?

135
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:18,570
- Who's the English guy?
- His name's Quentin.

136
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,298
Quentin, he's an enforcer
for Brantley.

137
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:22,513
Brantley? That's the guy
you stole the money off, right?

138
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,210
Yeah, yeah.

139
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:25,884
Dude, I've only seen
Quentin once before, okay?

140
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:27,325
But the guy's a fucking legend.

141
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,182
They sent four guys for him once...

142
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:31,652
Wow, great story. What did you take?

143
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,452
It was like a drug payment
or something. I don't know.

144
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,060
Brantley's into a lot of shit, man.

145
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:37,427
Look, I was just supposed
to pick up the money

146
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,190
from some guy in Eugene
and run it back.

147
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:42,224
- But you ran off with it instead.
- Yeah, because I had to.

148
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:44,275
Look, I saw some shit
I wasn't supposed to see.

149
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:46,464
Brantley...
Brantley's a paranoid fuck.

150
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:49,472
Look, I knew I was getting sent on
some sort of errand that I wasn't...

151
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,462
- supposed to come back from.
- Shut up. Shut up.

152
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:55,447
How much are we talking?

153
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,016
62K.

154
00:11:58,184 --> 00:11:59,151
- Jesus Christ.
- Yeah, I know.

155
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:01,149
- I fucking panicked, man.
- Shut up.

156
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:09,094
Where is it now?

157
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,530
I figured, like,
if I got far enough away,

158
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:19,227
they'd have to forget about it.

159
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:20,632
Forget about it?

160
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:24,115
They're never gonna forget about it.

161
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:26,637
These guys have rules.

162
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:35,578
There's only 49 here.
You're 13 short.

163
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,619
- Where is it?
- I spent some.

164
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:38,950
I've been using it to live off
since I left Oregon.

165
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:40,921
You must have lived
pretty fucking well.

166
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:44,757
God damn it.

167
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:48,358
- I've got to get out of here, man.
- And go where?

168
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:50,297
- He's still out there, though.
- Go where?

169
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:52,537
Where are you gonna go?

170
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,605
He followed you across the country.

171
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,604
He's gonna find you.
What are you gonna do?

172
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,536
I'm so fucked.

173
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:22,061
There's no way out of this.

174
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:24,065
All right, hey, hey, hey.

175
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,033
Listen to me. Hey.

176
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:28,503
Jason, listen to me.

177
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,302
I'll figure something out, okay?

178
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,534
Just calm down.

179
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,878
In the meantime,
you don't leave this room.

180
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:42,214
- Say it.
- I stay in the room.

181
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:44,887
Good.

182
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:47,150
- Maybe clean it up.
- Yeah.

183
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:39,338
Eyes forward.

184
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,103
Watch your position.

185
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:42,372
She's such a freak.

186
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:45,072
And her mother
is a total whack job.

187
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:54,292
Hi, baby.

188
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:59,062
You can't be here. You know that.

189
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:00,892
I couldn't help it.
I wanted to see you.

190
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,100
Mom, no.

191
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:05,193
Deva, watch your speed.

192
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,065
You can't keep doing this.

193
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:10,436
Sneaking into the house
and leaving me little toys.

194
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,406
It's creepy.

195
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:14,044
Deva, slow down right now.

196
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:17,271
I'm sorry I lied to you.

197
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:19,246
I was only trying to keep you safe.

198
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:21,443
Deva, brake!

199
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:24,088
I didn't have a mother
to keep me safe.

200
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,951
Please slow down. Slow down!

201
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:27,216
Brake!

202
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:30,555
Pull over right now!

203
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,060
Honey, it's me.

204
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,289
Deva, please slow down! Please!

205
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,660
I don't know who that is.

206
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:57,515
Hey, Sugar.

207
00:15:58,657 --> 00:15:59,988
How you doing, Brock?

208
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:02,353
Uh, pretty good, you know.

209
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:06,097
Just trying to track down Hood.

210
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,697
Thought you had radios for that.

211
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,300
Yeah, well, you know Hood.
He never keeps his on.

212
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:12,596
And I was just passing by, so I...

213
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:19,396
Man, that was something yesterday.
How you holding up?

214
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:21,037
I didn't get a belly full of lead.

215
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,977
Yeah, well, I've got to head back.

216
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:25,309
So, good to see you.

217
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:27,318
Yeah, I'll tell Hood
you were looking for him.

218
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,578
All right, thanks.

219
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:38,153
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay.

220
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:39,661
We were screaming at her...

221
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:45,665
- What the hell happened, Deva?
- Nothing. It was an accident.

222
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:47,471
That's crap.
You could have hurt someone.

223
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:49,403
You could have killed someone.
What are you thinking?

224
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:51,735
They were talking shit about Mom.

225
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,079
She freaked out.
She started going super fast.

226
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:57,182
- She almost killed us.
- I'm sorry.

227
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:58,543
You're sorry?
You could have killed those girls.

228
00:16:58,751 --> 00:16:59,979
Hey, you talk to me.

229
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:02,381
Your freak show of a kid
put my daughter in danger.

230
00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:06,488
You say another fucking
word about my daughter

231
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,250
and I'll feed you your fucking lungs.

232
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:09,928
Got me, you piece of shit?

233
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:27,839
- Mom.
- Max.

234
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:32,980
Come here. Oh.

235
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,220
I didn't know you were coming.

236
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,154
You didn't? Didn't Daddy tell you?

237
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,420
I mean, he said you were coming,
but he didn't say when.

238
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,292
I'm here now. Come here. Mwah.

239
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,060
- How are you?
- I'm so happy to see you.

240
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,965
- Deva's not home.
- Know what, buddy?

241
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:55,970
This time, I came just to see you.

242
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:57,301
Go show me that trick again.

243
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,738
- Let me see.
- All right.

244
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,676
- You found this in his apartment?
- Yep.

245
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:09,116
Why would the sheriff have
a picture of your family?

246
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:10,788
I have no idea.

247
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:21,023
And what about these guys
that shot at him yesterday?

248
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,565
Well, we haven't ID'd the stiff yet

249
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,670
and one of them got away,
so we don't have much to go on there.

250
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:34,106
Gordon, you all right?

251
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:39,181
Yeah, sure, Brock. I'm great.

252
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:43,013
On top of the fucking world.

253
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:44,689
Hey.

254
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,619
You asked me, remember?

255
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:48,554
Look, I'm sorry. I'm just...

256
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:54,829
I'm not at my best these days.

257
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:00,196
Listen,

258
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,467
you let me worry about Hood,
all right?

259
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:07,242
I feel like things might be starting
to break there a little bit.

260
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:09,966
We just got to be patient,
wait for them to break a little more.

261
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:12,882
- All right?
- Yeah, all right. Thanks.

262
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:38,707
Nice spot.

263
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,747
Sheriff Hood.

264
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:48,384
Myself, I stopped drinking
some years ago.

265
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:51,689
I didn't make a very good drunk.

266
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,324
Some might say
I made an excellent one.

267
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:57,855
Either way,

268
00:19:58,063 --> 00:20:00,759
I now feed booze to the birds.

269
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:04,732
For some reason it soothes me.

270
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,598
You're not exactly
keeping a low profile.

271
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:15,169
And you don't fight
like a small-town sheriff.

272
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,542
You, my friend,
have the sort of skills

273
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,014
that can't be taught, only acquired.

274
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:23,120
We were all something else
once upon a time, eh?

275
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:25,823
Guess so.

276
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,960
Men like us,

277
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:34,064
we've every reason
to appreciate a day like this.

278
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:39,404
Men like us?

279
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:42,907
Fighters.

280
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:45,443
Killers.

281
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,880
Armies of one.

282
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:53,397
I don't know anything about you,

283
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:55,281
but I know everything
I need to know.

284
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:56,749
The way we live our lives,

285
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:59,719
we know every day could be our last.

286
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,358
Sooner or later, it will be.

287
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,255
The sooner, most likely.

288
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:06,363
Maybe, but right now
let's talk about the money.

289
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:10,228
When I figure I'll have to stay
in a place for a bit,

290
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:14,167
I like to check out
the local law enforcement.

291
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:17,069
It's a practice I've developed
for some years.

292
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,608
A little due diligence.

293
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:23,475
Well, when I discovered
the sheriff's name was Hood...

294
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:27,677
that complicates things.

295
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:31,315
How so?

296
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:35,818
In any other case,
you and I might be able to

297
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:39,293
work out some kind
of professional courtesies.

298
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:42,296
But a father's not gonna
give up his son.

299
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:44,366
You're not leaving town without him.

300
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,570
No.

301
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:48,802
I have a strict mandate
to bring the boy

302
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:50,702
and the money back to Brantley.

303
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:53,605
He likes to deal with this sort
of thing up close and personal.

304
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,175
So...

305
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:03,820
So, one of us

306
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:05,785
is gonna have to kill the other.

307
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:11,161
Which is a shame, really,

308
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:14,491
since neither one of us
made this mess.

309
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,525
You know, in my experience...

310
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,036
there's usually a deal to be made.

311
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:24,472
I have a similar experience,

312
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,196
but in this case,
I don't really see...

313
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:28,372
50 on top of the 62 the boy owes.

314
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:33,451
So you're offering me a bribe?

315
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:35,210
Not a bribe, a token.

316
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,383
I'd give you more if I had it.

317
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:42,427
50,000, you go back,
you tell them he's dead.

318
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:46,891
You and me...

319
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:52,260
we both get to live
another day in the sun.

320
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:58,071
- What's that?
- That's the 13

321
00:22:58,277 --> 00:23:01,644
to go with the 49,
make up the 62 you owe.

322
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:03,781
Wait, you're giving me your money?

323
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:06,348
No, I'm giving it
to Quentin, and this.

324
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:08,747
- What are you doing?
- We have an agreement.

325
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:14,115
I mean, I can't let you do this.

326
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:17,227
Really? Come on, cut the shit.

327
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,455
When do we bring him the cash?

328
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:22,634
Not we. Me.

329
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:25,599
- What do I do?
- You get on a train, go to Canada.

330
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:26,930
Live your life.

331
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:36,103
112,000, all in.

332
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:44,082
- Don't want to count it?
- Just make sure you keep your end.

333
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:47,425
I will.

334
00:23:48,694 --> 00:23:50,355
My condolences, then.

335
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:52,530
What for?

336
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:54,188
You just lost a son.

337
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:01,700
- Yes, I did.
- Let's hope so.

338
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:04,102
For all our sakes.

339
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:05,309
Why are you helping me?

340
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:12,076
You're not the first guy
to make a mistake.

341
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:19,548
Things happen.

342
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:13,040
Mr. Procter.

343
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:16,009
Juliet,

344
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:18,148
I told you many times before,
call me Kai.

345
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:21,879
You're here for your money?

346
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:24,385
- If that's okay.
- Of course.

347
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:27,489
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no.

348
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:30,389
Don't ever apologize for
asking for what you're owed.

349
00:25:30,596 --> 00:25:34,930
It's just that sometimes I get
a little behind on the rent, so...

350
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:37,067
It's fine. It's all fine.

351
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:39,863
Payroll is next door.
Why don't you come with me?

352
00:25:43,175 --> 00:25:45,040
Uh, actually,

353
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:47,711
I need to go pick up my son
from the babysitter soon.

354
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:52,213
So I should probably
just get out of here.

355
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:53,748
Just stay a little while.

356
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:43,768
Fuck!

357
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,837
Hello, Jason.

358
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,301
Get your knickers on.

359
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:53,234
So it went smoothly?

360
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:54,445
I guess so.

361
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:57,343
- And now you're broke.
- Temporarily.

362
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:02,076
That's a lot of money
to give a stranger.

363
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:05,415
Why the kid?
It's not like you owe him anything.

364
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,057
No.

365
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:08,988
But maybe I owe his old man.

366
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:12,797
Hmm.

367
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:18,263
Got rats in the basement.

368
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:22,031
Fumigated a few weeks ago.
Thought they were gone.

369
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,765
Turns out they only wanted me
to think they were gone.

370
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:28,369
So now I'm bringing out
the big guns.

371
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:33,851
Played by a bunch of rodents.

372
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,117
Hey! Hello!

373
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,593
Now I thought we had a deal.

374
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,366
If you thought that,
you wouldn't have followed me, eh?

375
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:28,198
True. I guess we're both
full of shit, huh?

376
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:30,968
I suppose so.

377
00:28:32,611 --> 00:28:33,611
The kid in the trunk?

378
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,741
Yeah.

379
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:38,643
- Hello!
- You all right, kid?

380
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:44,381
You know,

381
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:48,772
you could have been
a long way away by now.

382
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:53,361
I couldn't do it.

383
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:56,432
Professional pride fucking with me.

384
00:28:56,635 --> 00:28:57,795
Fair enough.

385
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:02,273
So what now?

386
00:29:17,556 --> 00:29:19,717
You're no small-town sheriff.

387
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:20,949
Nope.

388
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:12,769
- Hello!
- Hey.

389
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:13,978
Let's go.

390
00:30:24,723 --> 00:30:25,723
Dad.

391
00:30:30,729 --> 00:30:31,821
Dad.

392
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:35,726
Dad, you're drunk.

393
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:37,595
No, I just had some drinks.

394
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:38,802
Come on.

395
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:44,800
We're almost there. Two more steps.

396
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,102
I've got it.

397
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:49,069
Two more steps.

398
00:30:54,486 --> 00:30:55,510
Back to bed, Max.

399
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,880
Now.

400
00:30:59,658 --> 00:31:00,716
Are you okay, Dad?

401
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:05,760
I'm good, Max. Just go to bed, okay?

402
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:07,556
- It's okay.
- Dad's okay.

403
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:12,069
It's good.

404
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:15,472
Dad.

405
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,405
I'm sorry.

406
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,691
I took this off your father
before I buried him.

407
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,864
I don't know why I kept it.

408
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:44,594
Just didn't feel right
to throw it away.

409
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:47,935
I thought you should have it.

410
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:51,867
Yeah.

411
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:54,409
There's a train,
leaves tomorrow at 10:00.

412
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:57,240
I'll be by at 9:30 to pick you up.

413
00:31:57,449 --> 00:31:59,644
You get on the train, you go north.

414
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:01,011
You go all the way to Canada.

415
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:02,413
Even you can't fuck that up.

416
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:05,714
Okay, yeah, I got it.

417
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,152
Uh-huh.

418
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:09,190
What about you?

419
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:11,294
Who knows?
Maybe one of these days,

420
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:13,487
I'll be getting on
one of those trains myself.

421
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:15,256
Huh. Not yet?

422
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:18,898
- Not yet.
- Hey...

423
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:24,208
Thank you.

424
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:30,643
Just remember,

425
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,650
you only get one second chance.

426
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:36,915
I know.

427
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:47,028
Here's your toast.

428
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:49,957
Sure I can't get you anything else?

429
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:51,692
No, thank you.

430
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,702
I haven't seen you before.
Are you new?

431
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:58,341
Uh, I just moved from New York.

432
00:33:00,612 --> 00:33:02,102
Most people go
in the other direction.

433
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:03,803
What, do you got family
in Michigan?

434
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:05,880
Just needed a change.

435
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,783
What can I get you, Mr. Marine?

436
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:13,552
My name's Gordon Hopewell.

437
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:15,726
Carrie.

438
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:17,728
I know.

439
00:33:33,445 --> 00:33:34,571
Don't say anything.

440
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:37,509
What can I get you?

441
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:39,740
I'll take blueberry pancakes
and some syrup.

442
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:40,975
You got it, honey.

443
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:49,054
When did you first figure out
your father was a criminal?

444
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,410
I heard you were on
the way out of here.

445
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:15,347
Not without saying good-bye.

446
00:34:16,855 --> 00:34:18,295
So you put the pieces back together?

447
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:19,980
Yeah, just about.

448
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:23,227
Be nice to keep it that way.

449
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,722
I'm just here to thank you.

450
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:30,298
Well, then, one for the road.

451
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:47,442
Hey.

452
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:52,318
Nobody needs to know your plans.

453
00:34:52,524 --> 00:34:53,604
It's my last night in town.

454
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:55,011
I'm just trying to make it count.

455
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,854
You don't want to go there.

456
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:02,658
See, that one's
more trouble than you know.

457
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:04,835
It's the good kind
of trouble, all right?

458
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:26,323
What?

459
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:28,484
Nothing.

460
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:32,022
This is nice.

461
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,500
Yeah.

462
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,749
What are you thinking about?

463
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:00,648
I don't know.

464
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:06,788
I was thinking about something

465
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,932
someone said to me the other day.

466
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:16,868
I mean, you get used to
a certain way of being

467
00:36:17,075 --> 00:36:18,372
and, uh...

468
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:35,582
Do you think we are who we are?

469
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:37,624
Or do you think we can change?

470
00:36:40,732 --> 00:36:42,324
What, you mean people like you?

471
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:45,533
Well, me, you,

472
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:47,170
people in general.

473
00:36:52,477 --> 00:36:55,605
I don't know if anyone
ever changes, really.

474
00:36:56,748 --> 00:36:58,716
But we can evolve, right?

475
00:37:01,653 --> 00:37:03,245
I mean, that's what
we're trying to do, isn't it?

476
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:06,617
Just become better versions
of ourselves.

477
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:26,637
So you think we evolve?

478
00:37:29,147 --> 00:37:30,478
I'm counting on it.

479
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:35,837
You're either with me

480
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,041
or you're not.

481
00:39:42,613 --> 00:39:43,613
Do you understand?

482
00:40:13,845 --> 00:40:14,845
You okay?

483
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:19,416
I'm fine.

484
00:42:37,622 --> 00:42:39,283
Long day?

485
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:40,957
You have no idea.

486
00:42:41,158 --> 00:42:43,820
Hmm, you know,
my mother used to say

487
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:46,428
even a train got to stop sometime.

488
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:51,728
I'm gonna make you
my Last Call cocktail.

489
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:55,438
Why don't you make it a double?

490
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,835
No, I'll make it
any damn way I want to.

491
00:42:58,042 --> 00:42:59,042
Here.

492
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:06,446
- Nice.
- Where's mine?

493
00:43:06,651 --> 00:43:07,777
Hey, Job.

494
00:43:09,654 --> 00:43:10,882
How was New York?

495
00:43:14,492 --> 00:43:17,222
I see you got your ass kicked again
while I was gone.

496
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,623
It's starting to be a thing.

497
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:22,264
Every man needs a hobby.

498
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:24,127
Do I even want to know?

499
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:26,769
Probably not. How'd it go?

500
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:29,973
How'd it go?

501
00:43:34,812 --> 00:43:36,643
You couldn't get rid of them?

502
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:38,371
There was a wrinkle.

503
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:48,597
I should have found out everything
there was to know

504
00:43:48,693 --> 00:43:50,684
about those diamonds
before you went in.

505
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:53,897
Where they came from.

506
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:01,861
Rabbit fucked you.

507
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,471
He fucked you hard.

508
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:08,311
You served 15 years

509
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:10,571
for stealing a handful of glass.
