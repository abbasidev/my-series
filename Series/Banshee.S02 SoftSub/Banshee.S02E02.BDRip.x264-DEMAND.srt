1
00:00:57,286 --> 00:00:58,878
You got a fuckin' problem?

2
00:04:06,341 --> 00:04:07,365
Elizabeth.

3
00:04:11,513 --> 00:04:14,710
- Juliet, Mr. Proctor here?
- Is he expecting you?

4
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:17,544
Oh, I imagine some part of him
is always expecting me.

5
00:04:17,752 --> 00:04:18,810
I hear that.

6
00:04:18,987 --> 00:04:20,011
You can head back.
I'll let him know.

7
00:04:20,222 --> 00:04:21,280
Thanks.

8
00:04:42,544 --> 00:04:45,377
Oh. Sorry, I didn't realize
you were in a meeting.

9
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,945
No, it's fine.
Come in, come in.

10
00:04:47,149 --> 00:04:49,879
We were just finishing up anyway.
Weren't we, Mr. Camden?

11
00:04:50,085 --> 00:04:53,953
Deputy Lotus,
this is my associate Isaac Camden.

12
00:04:54,156 --> 00:04:56,624
What the hell
is going on in here?

13
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:59,624
Mr. Camden had an unfortunate
accident on his way in,

14
00:04:59,995 --> 00:05:01,053
but we sorted it out.

15
00:05:01,263 --> 00:05:02,924
- Right, Isaac?
- That's right.

16
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:04,792
- Yeah.
- Hey.

17
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,434
- You sure?
- Yes, it's fine.

18
00:05:07,636 --> 00:05:10,730
Burton, why don't you get
Mr. Camden a drink on his way out?

19
00:05:16,344 --> 00:05:17,641
See you next week.

20
00:05:22,017 --> 00:05:23,575
What the hell was that about?

21
00:05:23,785 --> 00:05:26,015
That was just
a small negotiation.

22
00:05:26,888 --> 00:05:27,946
May I pour you one?

23
00:05:28,123 --> 00:05:30,455
No, thanks.
I'm on duty.

24
00:05:30,792 --> 00:05:32,521
So, what can I do for you?

25
00:05:32,761 --> 00:05:33,761
Well, I'm...

26
00:05:33,895 --> 00:05:35,260
I'm just following up
on those two bodies...

27
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,430
we dug up last month.

28
00:05:36,598 --> 00:05:38,828
Yeah, Munson and Randall.
I'm well aware.

29
00:05:39,167 --> 00:05:41,397
Yeah. They,
they work for you?

30
00:05:41,703 --> 00:05:43,295
They worked for me, yeah.

31
00:05:43,505 --> 00:05:44,802
In what capacity?

32
00:05:45,006 --> 00:05:46,564
They hauled meat, mostly.

33
00:05:46,741 --> 00:05:48,231
Right.
Not a job you generally...

34
00:05:48,443 --> 00:05:50,138
associate with getting shot
and buried in the woods.

35
00:05:50,345 --> 00:05:51,345
No, it's not.

36
00:05:51,546 --> 00:05:53,070
And as I told Agent Xavier,

37
00:05:53,281 --> 00:05:55,579
I have no idea what they may have
been up to in their free time.

38
00:05:55,784 --> 00:05:56,784
Yeah, I read the report.

39
00:05:56,918 --> 00:05:58,317
Well, just figured I'd stop by...

40
00:05:58,553 --> 00:06:01,681
and see if maybe you had
anything further to share.

41
00:06:04,092 --> 00:06:06,026
Are you implying I may
not have been truthful...

42
00:06:06,261 --> 00:06:07,626
with the FBI?

43
00:06:08,096 --> 00:06:09,961
Like I said,
I'm just following up.

44
00:06:10,398 --> 00:06:12,229
Yeah.
And now you have.

45
00:06:12,434 --> 00:06:13,901
You can see yourself out.

46
00:06:15,403 --> 00:06:17,564
Well, okay.
Thank you for your time.

47
00:06:18,373 --> 00:06:20,341
You've been a big help,
as always.

48
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,433
Oh, by any chance,

49
00:06:23,011 --> 00:06:24,273
do you remember the
last time you saw...

50
00:06:24,446 --> 00:06:25,606
either one of those men?

51
00:06:25,847 --> 00:06:27,474
I do, actually.

52
00:06:27,782 --> 00:06:30,376
It was the same day
Sheriff Hood came to town.

53
00:06:33,154 --> 00:06:34,485
It's fascinating how the mind...

54
00:06:34,689 --> 00:06:36,122
makes connections like that.

55
00:06:39,694 --> 00:06:41,218
Thank you.

56
00:06:41,463 --> 00:06:42,896
You're welcome.

57
00:06:45,267 --> 00:06:47,030
Now we have yet
to fully calculate...

58
00:06:47,235 --> 00:06:48,795
the losses sustained in
the explosion...

59
00:06:48,803 --> 00:06:50,862
No one told me
the council was meeting.

60
00:06:52,307 --> 00:06:53,797
I called an emergency session.

61
00:06:53,975 --> 00:06:55,636
Really?
What's the emergency?

62
00:06:55,844 --> 00:06:57,505
I've been up front
with you, Alex.

63
00:06:57,679 --> 00:07:01,046
We can't sit back while our tribe's
fiscal security is threatened.

64
00:07:01,216 --> 00:07:02,410
I've been chief less
than two months...

65
00:07:02,617 --> 00:07:03,897
and he's already planning
a coup.

66
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:04,918
And in those two months,

67
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,749
our hotel project
has been destroyed

68
00:07:07,455 --> 00:07:09,252
and now our casino
has been robbed.

69
00:07:09,624 --> 00:07:11,319
Those are not unrelated events.

70
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,594
Look, I'll admit
we've had some setbacks,

71
00:07:13,795 --> 00:07:14,921
but my people and I
are working on it.

72
00:07:15,163 --> 00:07:16,687
We expect to have
the missing money back shortly.

73
00:07:16,898 --> 00:07:19,025
It's not about the money, Alex.

74
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,794
It's about your ability to lead.

75
00:07:26,808 --> 00:07:28,608
I'd have a lot more faith
in his intentions...

76
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,473
if he weren't angling
to be chief himself.

77
00:07:30,712 --> 00:07:32,703
That may be, but his ambitions

78
00:07:32,914 --> 00:07:35,154
don't in any way mitigate the
troubles we've been having.

79
00:07:35,283 --> 00:07:36,944
I'm very aware of the problems

80
00:07:37,152 --> 00:07:38,414
we've been having,
Mr. Thompson.

81
00:07:38,586 --> 00:07:39,610
I just need some time.

82
00:07:39,854 --> 00:07:41,254
You had quite a bit of time
already.

83
00:07:41,456 --> 00:07:43,496
- Mr. DeLoria, I...
- This isn't a witch hunt, Alex.

84
00:07:43,658 --> 00:07:46,525
We're just trying to do
our duty to the tribe.

85
00:07:47,429 --> 00:07:49,693
Now, I loved and
respected your father.

86
00:07:50,165 --> 00:07:51,462
We all did.

87
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,473
But to give fitting honor
to his memory...

88
00:07:53,702 --> 00:07:56,262
Don't get ahead
of yourself, George.

89
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,870
And don't ever tell me
how to honor my father again.

90
00:08:07,082 --> 00:08:09,209
I'll see you all
at the next meeting.

91
00:08:18,827 --> 00:08:20,294
Hey, Squirrel.

92
00:08:20,495 --> 00:08:21,689
Breece.

93
00:08:23,231 --> 00:08:25,392
Jesus Christ.

94
00:08:25,633 --> 00:08:27,396
You look good.

95
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:29,296
Deputy, huh?

96
00:08:29,471 --> 00:08:30,471
Congratulations.

97
00:08:30,605 --> 00:08:32,072
You can't be here
right now, okay?

98
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,364
I have a restraining
order against you.

99
00:08:33,508 --> 00:08:34,508
I know, I'm sorry.

100
00:08:34,609 --> 00:08:36,042
I just didn't know how else
to get a hold of you.

101
00:08:36,211 --> 00:08:37,178
You're not supposed
to get a hold of me.

102
00:08:37,445 --> 00:08:38,707
That's what
a restraining order means.

103
00:08:38,913 --> 00:08:40,540
I know. Look, I'm not here to cause
you any trouble...

104
00:08:40,682 --> 00:08:42,843
- You need to leave right now.
- Siobhan, please.

105
00:08:43,051 --> 00:08:45,144
Just, just give me two minutes.

106
00:08:45,387 --> 00:08:46,945
That's all I ask.

107
00:08:49,891 --> 00:08:51,256
Okay, two minutes.

108
00:08:52,026 --> 00:08:53,288
Thank you.

109
00:08:53,461 --> 00:08:55,793
- Listen, Squirrel...
- Don't call me that.

110
00:08:56,364 --> 00:08:57,922
Okay.

111
00:08:58,133 --> 00:08:59,725
I know how angry
you must be at me,

112
00:08:59,934 --> 00:09:01,561
and I deserve all of it.

113
00:09:01,836 --> 00:09:03,599
But I want you to know
that I left here three years ago

114
00:09:03,772 --> 00:09:04,772
angry and drunk,

115
00:09:04,939 --> 00:09:06,499
and I'm neither
of those things anymore.

116
00:09:06,641 --> 00:09:08,506
I've been sober now
for two years.

117
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,870
Anyway, the thing is,

118
00:09:10,011 --> 00:09:12,275
I haven't had steady work
in seven months.

119
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,300
As soon as they do
a background check on me,

120
00:09:14,382 --> 00:09:15,440
all the stuff here
comes up and...

121
00:09:15,617 --> 00:09:17,137
Oh, I know you're not
about to blame me

122
00:09:17,218 --> 00:09:19,516
- for your police record.
- No, no... of course not.

123
00:09:19,687 --> 00:09:22,315
It's just my cousin Jesse.
You remember Jesse.

124
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:23,821
Anyway, he said that
I could come back here...

125
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,687
and work for him
building swimming pools.

126
00:09:26,194 --> 00:09:27,593
It's decent pay, benefits,

127
00:09:27,762 --> 00:09:29,059
but he won't have me on...

128
00:09:29,197 --> 00:09:30,926
while I have that
restraining order on me.

129
00:09:31,499 --> 00:09:32,659
- You're kidding me.
- Look,

130
00:09:32,867 --> 00:09:35,700
I know this is
a lot to ask, Squirr...

131
00:09:35,904 --> 00:09:37,337
Siobhan.

132
00:09:38,173 --> 00:09:40,107
And I know I don't
deserve mercy from you.

133
00:09:40,508 --> 00:09:42,442
But I have been looking
everywhere for work...

134
00:09:42,644 --> 00:09:44,475
and I'm telling you
there's nothing out there.

135
00:09:44,846 --> 00:09:46,143
This is my best shot.

136
00:09:50,718 --> 00:09:51,718
Hey, Emmett.

137
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,978
What the hell are you
doing here, Breece?

138
00:09:53,221 --> 00:09:54,882
It's okay, Emmett.

139
00:09:56,224 --> 00:09:57,704
Move along now
or I'll move you along.

140
00:09:57,826 --> 00:09:58,986
Emmett.

141
00:10:00,462 --> 00:10:02,692
Emmett, I got this.

142
00:10:09,037 --> 00:10:11,938
Sheriff, I need you to sign off
on these reports.

143
00:10:14,275 --> 00:10:16,115
- What do you got?
- Now I can write it all up,

144
00:10:16,177 --> 00:10:18,236
but only you can sign your name.

145
00:10:22,383 --> 00:10:23,782
What's up?

146
00:10:24,819 --> 00:10:27,617
Breece Connors,
Siobhan's ex-husband.

147
00:10:37,632 --> 00:10:38,929
So what was that about?

148
00:10:39,133 --> 00:10:40,361
A job he's after.

149
00:10:40,568 --> 00:10:42,297
He wants me to lift
the restraining order.

150
00:10:42,504 --> 00:10:44,904
Hope you told him to get lost.
You told him no, right?

151
00:10:45,106 --> 00:10:46,767
I told him to take the job
and I'd think about it.

152
00:10:46,975 --> 00:10:48,340
- He needs to work.
- Are you kidding me?

153
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,990
After everything
he put you through...

154
00:10:50,044 --> 00:10:51,443
Emmett, look...

155
00:10:53,248 --> 00:10:54,738
I'm not the same person anymore.

156
00:10:54,949 --> 00:10:56,075
Maybe he's not.

157
00:10:56,251 --> 00:10:58,685
But either way, I'm not gonna
keep him from working.

158
00:11:19,107 --> 00:11:20,540
So the prosecution and defense

159
00:11:20,742 --> 00:11:22,437
have both signed off
on the plea deal.

160
00:11:22,677 --> 00:11:23,871
- Is that correct?
- Yes, Your Honor.

161
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:25,204
We're good with it, Judge.

162
00:11:25,413 --> 00:11:27,347
Reduced charges
of reckless endangerment,

163
00:11:27,515 --> 00:11:29,676
and discharging
of an illegal firearm.

164
00:11:29,851 --> 00:11:32,149
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Okay, then.

165
00:11:32,353 --> 00:11:34,082
Mrs. Hopewell,
please rise.

166
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,623
I've reviewed
the police reports...

167
00:11:37,792 --> 00:11:38,952
from the night in question...

168
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,720
and considered
the mitigating factors...

169
00:11:40,895 --> 00:11:43,420
as well as the recommendation
of the DA's office,

170
00:11:43,598 --> 00:11:45,589
and the agreement
of the attorneys present.

171
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,494
Based on minimum
sentencing guidelines,

172
00:11:47,702 --> 00:11:50,034
and the recommendation
of the prosecution,

173
00:11:50,338 --> 00:11:53,307
you're hereby sentenced to serve
no less than 30 days

174
00:11:53,508 --> 00:11:55,567
at the Mercer County
Women's State Correctional.

175
00:11:55,777 --> 00:11:57,039
Your Honor, really?

176
00:11:57,245 --> 00:11:59,509
Mercer County is 200 miles away.

177
00:11:59,714 --> 00:12:01,545
That is an undue hardship
on her family...

178
00:12:01,716 --> 00:12:02,876
Overcrowding
in the county system...

179
00:12:03,051 --> 00:12:04,746
compels us to follow
the empty beds.

180
00:12:04,953 --> 00:12:07,717
There's nothing you can
do about it, Jackson.

181
00:12:07,889 --> 00:12:10,016
Prisoner is to be remanded
into custody immediately.

182
00:12:10,191 --> 00:12:12,625
Can you at least stay
the sentence for 72 hours...

183
00:12:12,827 --> 00:12:15,159
so that Mrs. Hopewell,
who is the mother of two children,

184
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,730
can get her affairs
in order, please?

185
00:12:20,435 --> 00:12:21,732
We're good with that,
Your Honor.

186
00:12:22,604 --> 00:12:24,697
Mrs. Hopewell, you are
to surrender yourself...

187
00:12:24,906 --> 00:12:27,397
to the Banshee
Sheriff's Department at 9:00 a.m.

188
00:12:27,609 --> 00:12:28,803
Three days from now.

189
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:32,077
If you do not appear,
you will forfeit your bond.

190
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,271
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

191
00:12:36,384 --> 00:12:37,442
Gordon.

192
00:12:38,453 --> 00:12:40,148
- Sheriff.
- How are the kids?

193
00:12:40,388 --> 00:12:41,878
How the fuck you think they are?

194
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:44,217
Racine's squeezing her.

195
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:47,127
He thinks she knows something.

196
00:12:47,428 --> 00:12:49,157
Yeah?
For all I know, he's right.

197
00:12:49,364 --> 00:12:50,854
Is that why you
let her go to jail?

198
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,465
Fuck you.

199
00:12:53,668 --> 00:12:55,226
You don't put that shit on me.

200
00:12:55,436 --> 00:12:57,495
She's in this mess
because of you, not me.

201
00:12:57,739 --> 00:12:59,138
You want to hit me back?

202
00:12:59,307 --> 00:13:00,535
Yeah, go ahead, hit me.

203
00:13:00,742 --> 00:13:02,607
It's what you do, isn't it?

204
00:13:02,777 --> 00:13:04,074
Come on, motherfucker, hit me.

205
00:13:04,312 --> 00:13:06,075
Hit me, motherfucker.

206
00:13:11,085 --> 00:13:13,383
I gave you the first one.

207
00:13:13,621 --> 00:13:15,384
You don't get another.

208
00:13:51,092 --> 00:13:53,287
- Come dance with me.
- No way. I'm good here.

209
00:13:53,461 --> 00:13:55,520
Come on. I want to dance
with my husband.

210
00:13:55,763 --> 00:13:56,763
That's okay, Squirrel.

211
00:13:58,066 --> 00:13:59,260
Just enjoying the view.

212
00:13:59,434 --> 00:14:01,629
Okay, I'm giving you
10 minutes...

213
00:14:01,936 --> 00:14:03,699
and then I'm coming
back for you.

214
00:14:03,905 --> 00:14:06,100
Ten minutes.
Ten minutes.

215
00:14:22,724 --> 00:14:24,191
- Hey!
- Fuck you, man.

216
00:14:25,927 --> 00:14:27,155
Breece, what are you doing?

217
00:14:27,361 --> 00:14:28,521
Get the fuck out of the way!

218
00:14:36,304 --> 00:14:37,703
Stay the fuck away from my wife.

219
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,170
Breece, Stop it!

220
00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:42,999
This is your fucking fault, too.

221
00:14:43,177 --> 00:14:44,497
You're shaking
your fucking ass...

222
00:14:44,512 --> 00:14:46,412
on his dick
right in front of me?

223
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,514
Hey.

224
00:15:02,163 --> 00:15:03,357
You okay?

225
00:15:04,766 --> 00:15:06,666
Emmett's got a big mouth.

226
00:15:11,873 --> 00:15:13,306
Just leave it alone, okay?

227
00:15:15,777 --> 00:15:16,777
Please?

228
00:15:19,714 --> 00:15:20,738
Okay.

229
00:15:38,966 --> 00:15:41,400
So Carrie's really going inside?

230
00:15:41,669 --> 00:15:42,966
Yeah.

231
00:15:43,304 --> 00:15:46,205
You know, I don't want to seem
insensitive, but I need...

232
00:15:46,407 --> 00:15:49,035
Racine's not interested
in you and Job.

233
00:15:50,611 --> 00:15:51,942
We get off, just like that?

234
00:15:52,146 --> 00:15:53,506
What do you want,
your own hearing?

235
00:15:53,714 --> 00:15:55,705
Oh, no, thank you.

236
00:15:55,917 --> 00:15:57,397
I just think we need
to worry about...

237
00:15:57,418 --> 00:15:58,908
a high-ranking federal agent...

238
00:15:59,153 --> 00:16:00,916
who doesn't seem
to answer to anyone.

239
00:16:01,122 --> 00:16:02,987
Didn't your mother
ever tell you?

240
00:16:03,257 --> 00:16:05,217
A wise man never looked
a gift horse in the mouth.

241
00:16:05,359 --> 00:16:09,318
No, my mother told me
a word to the wise is unnecessary.

242
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:12,260
It's a damn fool
who needs the advice.

243
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,563
Well, look here.

244
00:16:15,803 --> 00:16:18,931
Ain't we all
just domestic as shit?

245
00:16:21,008 --> 00:16:22,441
Your cut, baby.

246
00:16:25,046 --> 00:16:26,513
Yours, too.

247
00:16:27,915 --> 00:16:29,815
What the fuck you lookin' at?

248
00:16:30,051 --> 00:16:32,519
It's just sometimes
I just forget how...

249
00:16:34,488 --> 00:16:35,819
Never mind.

250
00:16:37,158 --> 00:16:39,092
Came out to about 156,000.

251
00:16:39,293 --> 00:16:41,853
Split four ways,
39 grand apiece.

252
00:16:42,129 --> 00:16:43,824
Definitely not our finest hour.

253
00:16:45,466 --> 00:16:47,024
This one is hers.

254
00:16:50,137 --> 00:16:52,367
I'll let you hang on to it.

255
00:16:52,573 --> 00:16:54,541
So she's really going in?

256
00:16:57,445 --> 00:16:58,537
It's 30 days.

257
00:16:58,746 --> 00:17:01,442
It's...
it's not so bad.

258
00:17:01,582 --> 00:17:04,608
Locked up, is locked up.

259
00:17:16,664 --> 00:17:18,598
Okay, they're coming out.

260
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,269
- What now?
- One way or another,

261
00:17:28,476 --> 00:17:30,676
you're gonna learn
to stay the hell away from my casino.

262
00:17:31,045 --> 00:17:32,273
This is getting boring.

263
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,920
Can't you come up with
something new?

264
00:17:34,048 --> 00:17:35,982
Okay, here's something new.

265
00:17:58,940 --> 00:17:59,940
Alex.

266
00:18:00,141 --> 00:18:01,699
I guess you're not
the only one in this town...

267
00:18:01,909 --> 00:18:03,706
who can get
their hands on C-4.

268
00:18:03,911 --> 00:18:06,903
You stole $156,000
from my truck.

269
00:18:07,114 --> 00:18:08,581
I want it back.

270
00:18:11,185 --> 00:18:12,743
Let's go. Close it down.

271
00:18:15,823 --> 00:18:17,256
Move aside.
Move aside.

272
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:18,858
- Let's go.
- Let's go. Move 'em in.

273
00:18:37,945 --> 00:18:40,106
Hi, honey.
I was hoping we could talk.

274
00:18:40,448 --> 00:18:41,728
What are you doing here, Breece?

275
00:18:41,949 --> 00:18:44,042
I heard from some of the guys
that you had a fire.

276
00:18:44,251 --> 00:18:45,343
I just figured I'd...

277
00:18:46,854 --> 00:18:48,321
I don't know.

278
00:18:49,457 --> 00:18:50,777
Do you need something
from inside?

279
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,554
No, I just wanted to see you.

280
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,157
I'm going away soon, and...

281
00:18:54,328 --> 00:18:55,328
Yeah, I know.

282
00:18:55,396 --> 00:18:57,227
The whole town knows.
Congratulations.

283
00:18:57,431 --> 00:19:00,264
I'm sorry, I thought I was gonna be
gone before you got back home.

284
00:19:00,468 --> 00:19:01,730
No, you can't come
around here, Breece.

285
00:19:01,936 --> 00:19:02,960
I know.

286
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:04,330
Well, maybe I'll just
come inside and give Max...

287
00:19:04,538 --> 00:19:06,506
You can't come in.

288
00:19:06,974 --> 00:19:08,703
I'm still his mother,
Deva, and yours.

289
00:19:08,909 --> 00:19:09,967
I don't know. Are you?

290
00:19:10,177 --> 00:19:11,667
How do I know
that wasn't a lie, too?

291
00:19:11,946 --> 00:19:13,004
Look, I know...

292
00:19:13,247 --> 00:19:14,807
- No. No.
- I have a lot to make up for.

293
00:19:14,849 --> 00:19:17,909
- Baby, I had reasons...
- I don't give a shit, Mom.

294
00:19:18,085 --> 00:19:19,780
You know Max is still
sleeping in my bed?

295
00:19:19,987 --> 00:19:21,667
He's too scared to sleep
in his own room...

296
00:19:21,689 --> 00:19:23,281
because you let them take him.

297
00:19:23,491 --> 00:19:25,322
You said you needed to work
and that's all this was, okay?

298
00:19:25,493 --> 00:19:27,290
I've moved on.
I don't wanna hear from you

299
00:19:27,428 --> 00:19:29,396
and I don't want you
coming around my house.

300
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,460
Well, either way.

301
00:19:41,475 --> 00:19:43,568
It's great to see you
doing so well.

302
00:19:45,146 --> 00:19:46,909
Just stay away from us.

303
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,521
Yo, check this shit out, bro.

304
00:20:01,729 --> 00:20:03,458
Hello, beautiful.

305
00:20:03,664 --> 00:20:05,529
Why don't you come
join us for a drink?

306
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,400
No, thanks.

307
00:20:07,768 --> 00:20:10,760
- We're shipping off soon.
- I'll pass. Thanks.

308
00:20:11,272 --> 00:20:12,569
Well, pass a bit slower...

309
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,401
so I can get a good look
at that ass.

310
00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:16,968
Damn, girl!
That's a thing of beauty.

311
00:20:17,211 --> 00:20:18,508
You ever consider modeling?

312
00:20:18,712 --> 00:20:20,232
You ever consider
shutting the fuck up?

313
00:20:20,281 --> 00:20:22,806
Oh, shit!
You got dissed, bro.

314
00:20:23,017 --> 00:20:24,075
Shut the fuck up, man.

315
00:20:36,764 --> 00:20:38,254
- Yeah.
- Oh.

316
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,858
Well, well, look who's back.

317
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,597
Hold on.
Slow down, now.

318
00:20:44,905 --> 00:20:46,873
You weren't very nice
to me back there.

319
00:20:47,241 --> 00:20:48,572
But now you can make up for it.

320
00:20:52,646 --> 00:20:54,045
Seriously?

321
00:20:54,248 --> 00:20:56,408
You were thinking about hitting
a United States Marine?

322
00:20:56,617 --> 00:20:57,777
Get off of me!

323
00:20:57,985 --> 00:20:59,976
You better learn how to throw a
better punch than that, little girl.

324
00:21:00,187 --> 00:21:01,347
Fuckin' bitch.

325
00:21:01,555 --> 00:21:03,075
- I'll teach you to shove...
- Oh, God!

326
00:21:19,306 --> 00:21:20,466
Who the fuck are you?

327
00:21:20,674 --> 00:21:23,006
I'd tell you, but you
wouldn't remember anyway.

328
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:30,213
Hi.

329
00:21:30,885 --> 00:21:31,885
Thank you.

330
00:21:32,086 --> 00:21:33,246
Don't thank me yet.

331
00:21:34,755 --> 00:21:36,154
- What is that?
- This?

332
00:21:36,357 --> 00:21:38,450
It's chloroform.

333
00:21:45,866 --> 00:21:47,731
This better be good.

334
00:21:53,174 --> 00:21:54,198
What are you doing?

335
00:21:54,475 --> 00:21:55,601
She's important to him.

336
00:21:55,809 --> 00:21:58,175
Besides, he owes us
a lot more money...

337
00:21:58,379 --> 00:22:00,040
than what we'll ask him for.

338
00:22:02,349 --> 00:22:05,011
George Hunter
is gunning for you.

339
00:22:05,486 --> 00:22:07,784
You need a win to keep
this council quiet.

340
00:22:12,459 --> 00:22:14,620
She just brings Proctor
to the table.

341
00:22:31,946 --> 00:22:33,641
Hey!
Can I help you?

342
00:22:33,847 --> 00:22:35,371
Where is she?

343
00:22:35,683 --> 00:22:36,877
- What are you talking about?
- Rebecca...

344
00:22:37,084 --> 00:22:38,644
I'm talking
about Rebecca. Where is she?

345
00:22:38,719 --> 00:22:40,118
Hey, you're gonna want
to back off right now.

346
00:22:40,321 --> 00:22:41,618
I haven't seen her.

347
00:22:42,489 --> 00:22:43,969
Well, she didn't
come home last night.

348
00:22:44,091 --> 00:22:45,820
Have you tried calling her?

349
00:22:48,629 --> 00:22:50,256
Yeah. Earlier.

350
00:23:02,576 --> 00:23:03,804
Hello, Kai.

351
00:23:04,078 --> 00:23:05,478
- Alex.
- Don't worry about Rebecca.

352
00:23:05,613 --> 00:23:08,446
She's perfectly fine,
for the moment.

353
00:23:08,716 --> 00:23:11,344
- I'm still waiting for my money.
- Put her on the phone now.

354
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:17,455
Uncle Kai?

355
00:23:17,658 --> 00:23:19,421
- You listening now?
- Yes.

356
00:23:19,627 --> 00:23:21,720
Bring me $156,000
by noon today...

357
00:23:21,929 --> 00:23:24,409
- and she walks out of here.
- I didn't rob your fuckin' truck.

358
00:23:24,531 --> 00:23:26,089
Well, then, I guess
we'll consider it

359
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,097
a down payment
on the casino you blew up.

360
00:23:28,302 --> 00:23:30,133
Now listen to me.

361
00:23:30,371 --> 00:23:32,635
At some point
in the very near future,

362
00:23:32,873 --> 00:23:34,033
you will be made to understand...

363
00:23:34,174 --> 00:23:35,573
how badly you misjudged
me today.

364
00:23:35,876 --> 00:23:37,400
And when that time comes,

365
00:23:37,611 --> 00:23:38,942
and you're begging me for mercy,

366
00:23:39,146 --> 00:23:41,011
I want you to remember
this moment

367
00:23:41,215 --> 00:23:43,215
because this is the moment
you've sealed your fate.

368
00:23:43,317 --> 00:23:44,978
Yeah, okay, duly noted.

369
00:23:45,185 --> 00:23:46,777
Just bring my fucking money.

370
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,930
It's Alex Longshadow.
He's taken Rebecca.

371
00:23:58,132 --> 00:24:00,293
I need you to go get her back.

372
00:24:04,071 --> 00:24:05,936
I have no jurisdiction
on the reservation.

373
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,198
Well, neither do I,

374
00:24:07,374 --> 00:24:09,334
but I'll get around that by going
in with an army.

375
00:24:09,443 --> 00:24:10,467
Is that what you want?

376
00:24:10,678 --> 00:24:12,543
Why don't you tell me
what's going on?

377
00:24:17,551 --> 00:24:19,849
A few weeks ago
you told me you owed me one.

378
00:24:21,422 --> 00:24:23,720
I'm sure you recall
that conversation.

379
00:24:28,529 --> 00:24:29,996
Good.

380
00:24:30,331 --> 00:24:32,094
Then go get her.

381
00:24:51,885 --> 00:24:53,648
Go on. It's all right.

382
00:24:54,755 --> 00:24:55,915
Go on.

383
00:24:57,091 --> 00:24:58,251
Easy.

384
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:06,278
I'm sure your uncle
will be here soon.

385
00:25:09,403 --> 00:25:11,234
I'm sure he will be, too.

386
00:25:14,842 --> 00:25:17,174
I used to see you
at the farmers' market.

387
00:25:18,912 --> 00:25:21,210
Your family sold pies, right?

388
00:25:22,049 --> 00:25:24,108
Now you've left that behind,

389
00:25:24,418 --> 00:25:26,682
moved into another
family business.

390
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,182
Sad, really.

391
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,251
I loved those pies.

392
00:25:34,561 --> 00:25:36,324
Did you help him do it?

393
00:25:39,066 --> 00:25:40,533
Help him do what?

394
00:25:42,236 --> 00:25:44,101
I think you know
exactly what I mean.

395
00:25:48,275 --> 00:25:50,869
You know, my people
have this myth...

396
00:25:51,078 --> 00:25:52,511
about the Thunder Man.

397
00:25:53,981 --> 00:25:55,778
He's reborn once
each generation.

398
00:25:55,983 --> 00:25:58,349
He's got the power of a god,

399
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:00,214
prodigious lover,
fiercest warrior.

400
00:26:00,521 --> 00:26:03,456
But outwardly, he looks like
a normal man.

401
00:26:03,724 --> 00:26:05,191
So every man
has to ask himself...

402
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:06,917
whether he might in fact be,

403
00:26:07,127 --> 00:26:08,856
the Thunder Man.

404
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:11,295
And every woman has to wonder

405
00:26:11,498 --> 00:26:13,591
whether the man
she's with is him.

406
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:17,961
Some women live to find him.

407
00:26:19,473 --> 00:26:22,306
Others know that he'll destroy them
if they stay with him.

408
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:25,911
I believe you think
you found your Thunder Man.

409
00:26:26,346 --> 00:26:28,177
I've got all the thunder I need.

410
00:26:29,216 --> 00:26:31,150
Is that so...

411
00:26:31,518 --> 00:26:33,008
Amish girl?

412
00:26:40,194 --> 00:26:41,889
Did your uncle rob my truck?

413
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:46,556
My uncle sells meat.

414
00:26:50,771 --> 00:26:54,468
Your uncle blew up
my fucking hotel.

415
00:26:57,077 --> 00:26:58,305
If I were you,

416
00:26:58,545 --> 00:27:01,878
I'd be more worried about
what he's going to do to you.

417
00:27:11,892 --> 00:27:13,359
We'll see about that.

418
00:27:27,074 --> 00:27:28,564
Five more seconds.

419
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:33,341
And we in.

420
00:27:34,448 --> 00:27:36,348
And by "we," I mean you.

421
00:27:46,527 --> 00:27:47,994
You should be
in the kitchen now.

422
00:27:48,195 --> 00:27:49,662
Excuse me, Sheriff,
are you lost?

423
00:27:49,863 --> 00:27:51,387
- Is this the kitchen?
- Yes.

424
00:27:51,598 --> 00:27:53,031
Then no.

425
00:27:53,233 --> 00:27:55,428
Okay, the most isolated room
is the VIP room.

426
00:27:55,636 --> 00:27:56,694
Where is it?

427
00:27:56,904 --> 00:27:58,337
Baby, I'm looking at
two sets of plans here...

428
00:27:58,539 --> 00:27:59,938
the old casino and the new one...

429
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:03,234
and I got no fucking clue what's real
and what ain't been built yet.

430
00:28:03,443 --> 00:28:04,740
Best guess?

431
00:28:07,047 --> 00:28:08,912
Take a left
at the end of the hall.

432
00:28:11,785 --> 00:28:13,218
I could be hacking Google,

433
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,648
or the Caymans,

434
00:28:14,855 --> 00:28:17,790
but, no, I gotta be
infiltrating Fort Apache.

435
00:28:19,493 --> 00:28:21,461
Hey. BSD.

436
00:28:21,595 --> 00:28:22,994
I need to get in there.

437
00:28:23,196 --> 00:28:24,720
BSD has no jurisdiction
on the rez.

438
00:28:24,932 --> 00:28:26,160
If you're not on the list,
you don't get in.

439
00:28:26,366 --> 00:28:27,663
Yeah...

440
00:28:29,269 --> 00:28:31,237
I could shoot you.

441
00:28:32,072 --> 00:28:33,505
We could shoot each other.

442
00:29:12,946 --> 00:29:14,243
That sounded nasty.

443
00:29:23,323 --> 00:29:24,688
And no dice.

444
00:29:24,891 --> 00:29:27,018
- Puns? Really?
- Sorry.

445
00:29:27,227 --> 00:29:28,319
Okay,
cut across the gaming room,

446
00:29:28,495 --> 00:29:30,224
go upstairs.

447
00:29:41,708 --> 00:29:43,471
Shit!

448
00:29:43,677 --> 00:29:45,076
What?

449
00:30:09,002 --> 00:30:10,367
What the hell's going on?

450
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:11,867
Job.

451
00:30:12,105 --> 00:30:13,936
Baby, come back.

452
00:30:14,174 --> 00:30:15,174
Baby?

453
00:30:16,343 --> 00:30:17,435
Fuck.

454
00:30:21,815 --> 00:30:23,043
Fuck!

455
00:30:24,985 --> 00:30:26,179
Hey!

456
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:14,032
Seriously.

457
00:31:31,885 --> 00:31:33,250
Sheriff Hood.

458
00:31:38,425 --> 00:31:39,585
Oh, hi.

459
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:44,927
Hi yourself.

460
00:31:45,098 --> 00:31:47,259
You think you know someone?

461
00:31:47,634 --> 00:31:48,965
I know, right?

462
00:31:50,137 --> 00:31:51,604
I'm sorry,
am I missing something?

463
00:31:51,838 --> 00:31:54,306
- We've met before.
- I'm just here for the girl.

464
00:31:54,808 --> 00:31:58,437
Oh. So you're one
of Proctor's lackeys, is that it?

465
00:31:58,645 --> 00:32:00,772
No, no.

466
00:32:00,981 --> 00:32:02,261
If your argument's with Proctor,

467
00:32:02,315 --> 00:32:04,010
you gotta take it up with him.

468
00:32:04,217 --> 00:32:07,675
I just get involved when you start
kidnapping young women.

469
00:32:09,489 --> 00:32:10,820
Now cut her loose.

470
00:32:11,024 --> 00:32:13,117
Well, you're in no position
to make demands here.

471
00:32:13,326 --> 00:32:14,918
What, this?

472
00:32:15,128 --> 00:32:16,493
Come on, we both know she's
not gonna shoot me.

473
00:32:16,696 --> 00:32:18,664
I wouldn't be so sure.

474
00:32:24,704 --> 00:32:26,501
Okay, this is Kinaho land.

475
00:32:26,706 --> 00:32:29,539
I have no authority to arrest you;
we all know that.

476
00:32:29,743 --> 00:32:31,040
But my guess is...

477
00:32:31,244 --> 00:32:33,337
she's not gonna
press charges anyway.

478
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,338
So we can chalk
this whole thing up...

479
00:32:35,482 --> 00:32:37,507
to one big misunderstanding.

480
00:32:38,485 --> 00:32:39,713
You let her go now,

481
00:32:41,254 --> 00:32:42,687
this never happened.

482
00:32:45,926 --> 00:32:47,393
- Put the gun down.
- Fuck that.

483
00:32:47,627 --> 00:32:49,094
Nola!

484
00:33:02,108 --> 00:33:03,405
Bye.

485
00:33:10,884 --> 00:33:13,114
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

486
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,651
Great.

487
00:33:21,428 --> 00:33:22,793
Thanks.

488
00:33:33,373 --> 00:33:34,772
Are you kidding me?

489
00:33:34,975 --> 00:33:36,670
We're not gonna shoot a sheriff.

490
00:33:36,877 --> 00:33:38,310
It was a bad idea to begin with.

491
00:33:41,047 --> 00:33:42,878
I'm done sending messages.

492
00:33:43,116 --> 00:33:45,175
It's time to take
a more direct approach.

493
00:33:52,692 --> 00:33:55,160
You came for me.
Thank you.

494
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,422
Don't mention it.

495
00:33:58,632 --> 00:33:59,860
You're bleeding.

496
00:34:00,133 --> 00:34:01,395
It's fine. It's just a scrape.

497
00:34:01,601 --> 00:34:03,728
- Here...
- I said it's fine.

498
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:21,844
Rebecca.

499
00:34:25,592 --> 00:34:27,856
I know this is
a hard time for you,

500
00:34:28,061 --> 00:34:29,255
but your uncle,

501
00:34:30,664 --> 00:34:32,188
he's not a good man.

502
00:34:35,735 --> 00:34:37,635
You shouldn't be living there.

503
00:34:39,172 --> 00:34:41,072
Well, then,
let me live with you.

504
00:34:42,375 --> 00:34:44,036
I'm not a good man either.

505
00:35:16,176 --> 00:35:17,643
Are you okay?

506
00:35:18,712 --> 00:35:20,077
I'm fine.

507
00:35:24,918 --> 00:35:26,476
I'm gonna go get
something to eat.

508
00:35:32,792 --> 00:35:34,419
So how did it go?

509
00:35:34,627 --> 00:35:36,322
Piece of cake.

510
00:35:37,831 --> 00:35:39,799
Well, thank you.
I do appreciate it.

511
00:35:41,334 --> 00:35:44,462
Like you said, I owed you one.

512
00:35:52,512 --> 00:35:53,979
Sheriff...

513
00:35:56,783 --> 00:35:58,876
you never did ask me
if I robbed that truck.

514
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,245
I guess I figured
it wasn't your style.

515
00:36:03,823 --> 00:36:05,450
No, it's not.

516
00:36:24,811 --> 00:36:26,711
This is nice.

517
00:36:29,516 --> 00:36:32,280
- I got you something.
- Alex.

518
00:36:32,619 --> 00:36:34,314
It's stunning.

519
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,655
What do you think?

520
00:36:42,862 --> 00:36:44,796
You look beautiful.

521
00:37:02,615 --> 00:37:05,516
Proctor, what the fuck?

522
00:37:05,785 --> 00:37:06,785
Hello, Alex.

523
00:37:10,757 --> 00:37:12,019
You come here to my home?

524
00:37:12,192 --> 00:37:13,352
Are you crazy?

525
00:37:13,526 --> 00:37:16,017
Yeah, your security personnel
weren't very effective.

526
00:37:16,229 --> 00:37:18,720
You may want to talk to them
when they wake up.

527
00:37:25,972 --> 00:37:27,269
This is very romantic.

528
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,034
Get the fuck out of here.

529
00:37:30,243 --> 00:37:32,507
Don't worry. Just be a minute.

530
00:37:34,614 --> 00:37:36,582
What the fuck is this?

531
00:38:19,926 --> 00:38:23,794
You go near my niece again
and it won't be cow's blood.

532
00:38:24,063 --> 00:38:26,190
It will be the blood
of your family.

533
00:38:27,267 --> 00:38:30,794
Every single one of them
I can get my hands on.

534
00:38:31,137 --> 00:38:33,571
I'll fucking drown you
in their blood.

535
00:39:09,776 --> 00:39:12,006
I'm not even going to ask.

536
00:39:13,713 --> 00:39:16,273
Figured I'll be
seeing you tomorrow.

537
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:19,690
Yeah, well, there's not much
of a difference...

538
00:39:19,752 --> 00:39:21,549
between my motel room
and a cell,

539
00:39:21,754 --> 00:39:24,450
so I figured I'd get a drink
while I still could.

540
00:39:28,228 --> 00:39:30,059
It's 30 days.

541
00:39:31,464 --> 00:39:32,984
That's not long enough
for the walls...

542
00:39:33,032 --> 00:39:35,398
to start fucking
with your head, okay?

543
00:39:37,537 --> 00:39:38,970
Anyone messes with you...

544
00:39:39,672 --> 00:39:41,572
you don't engage.

545
00:39:42,141 --> 00:39:44,541
You keep to yourself,
do quiet time.

546
00:39:47,647 --> 00:39:50,013
It's not prison
I'm worried about.

547
00:40:03,229 --> 00:40:05,322
That'll all work itself out.

548
00:40:09,168 --> 00:40:11,261
You just have to give them time.

549
00:40:32,792 --> 00:40:34,521
You should get some sleep.

550
00:40:37,697 --> 00:40:39,665
We got a long drive tomorrow.

551
00:40:42,568 --> 00:40:43,568
Yeah.

552
00:40:58,418 --> 00:40:59,942
You okay?

553
00:41:04,724 --> 00:41:06,351
This is all on me.

554
00:41:08,761 --> 00:41:11,059
She's going to jail,
'cause of me.

555
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,829
You did 15 years for her.

556
00:41:16,035 --> 00:41:17,468
It doesn't make it right.

557
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:19,137
Look, I think
you didn't consider...

558
00:41:19,339 --> 00:41:21,830
what would happen to her
when you set up shop here,

559
00:41:22,642 --> 00:41:25,338
but no one does
a stretch like you did...

560
00:41:25,511 --> 00:41:27,631
without making some mistakes
when they first come out.

561
00:41:27,814 --> 00:41:31,250
- Now you tell me.
- No, I think I told you then.

562
00:41:32,685 --> 00:41:35,677
Listen, you can
sit here and get drunk...

563
00:41:35,888 --> 00:41:38,379
while you dissect everything
you've gone through.

564
00:41:38,825 --> 00:41:41,885
We're ex-cons. It's what we do.

565
00:41:42,095 --> 00:41:43,892
But at some point or another,

566
00:41:44,097 --> 00:41:47,362
there's only one question
really worth asking yourself...

567
00:41:48,668 --> 00:41:51,865
What are you going to do now?

568
00:42:32,445 --> 00:42:33,445
Hey.

569
00:42:37,417 --> 00:42:39,044
You remember what I said.

570
00:42:41,788 --> 00:42:43,255
Quiet time.

571
00:42:44,891 --> 00:42:46,051
I know.

572
00:43:10,416 --> 00:43:12,008
Back it up.

573
00:43:34,173 --> 00:43:35,936
Rehall, let's go.

574
00:43:36,209 --> 00:43:39,042
- Move it, huh?
- Rowe, against the fence.

575
00:44:08,908 --> 00:44:09,908
Bye-bye!

576
00:44:36,002 --> 00:44:37,902
Look at this bitch.

577
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:49,773
Fuckin' Malibu Barbie
coming to do time.

578
00:45:05,831 --> 00:45:07,093
Backtracking?

579
00:45:07,333 --> 00:45:09,164
You got some attitude, bitch?

580
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:16,180
Come on, Squirrel.
We're gonna be late.

581
00:45:16,329 --> 00:45:18,957
- I'm doing my hair.
- Do it faster.

582
00:45:19,165 --> 00:45:21,497
Relax, Breece. The restaurant isn't
gonna run out of food.

583
00:45:23,769 --> 00:45:25,737
Don't you fucking
tell me to relax!

584
00:45:25,938 --> 00:45:27,565
Please, Breece...

585
00:45:41,153 --> 00:45:43,383
Hey, Squirrel.

586
00:45:43,723 --> 00:45:45,418
What the hell
are you doing here?

587
00:45:45,625 --> 00:45:47,425
I just thought, you know,
I'd make you dinner,

588
00:45:47,593 --> 00:45:48,651
like I used to.

589
00:45:48,928 --> 00:45:50,293
You can’t just
come into my house.

590
00:45:50,496 --> 00:45:52,123
Remember our
Friday nights like this?

591
00:45:52,331 --> 00:45:54,731
I'd cook and then we'd dance
right in the kitchen.

592
00:45:55,801 --> 00:45:57,041
I thought you weren't drinking.

593
00:45:57,069 --> 00:45:58,627
It's just a beer, baby.

594
00:45:59,272 --> 00:46:00,864
Come on.
One more dance, come on.

595
00:46:01,073 --> 00:46:02,301
- No. No.
- Come on!

596
00:46:02,508 --> 00:46:05,170
Get the fuck out of my house!

597
00:46:07,847 --> 00:46:09,041
Careful, now.

598
00:46:10,283 --> 00:46:12,649
I'm trying to be gracious here,

599
00:46:12,852 --> 00:46:14,376
to make amends.

600
00:46:18,057 --> 00:46:19,057
I said

601
00:46:19,225 --> 00:46:21,659
get the fuck out of my house.

602
00:46:21,861 --> 00:46:23,453
Now!

603
00:46:25,231 --> 00:46:26,755
You're gonna shoot me, Squirrel?

604
00:46:27,099 --> 00:46:28,293
Huh?

605
00:46:29,502 --> 00:46:30,730
Is that it?

606
00:46:31,437 --> 00:46:33,132
Jesus! What the fuck,
Siobhan?!

607
00:46:33,406 --> 00:46:35,601
The next one's
going in your gut.

608
00:46:38,844 --> 00:46:40,869
Big fucking cop now, huh?

609
00:46:41,047 --> 00:46:42,674
Want your fucking hair
all perfect?

610
00:46:42,882 --> 00:46:44,247
Well, there you go.

611
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:45,678
Well, go on, then.

612
00:46:45,885 --> 00:46:47,216
God!

613
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:48,853
Shoot me.

614
00:46:49,088 --> 00:46:51,352
Breece... God!

615
00:46:51,624 --> 00:46:53,751
- Breece!
- Shoot me?

616
00:46:54,327 --> 00:46:56,693
Fucking do it, you fucking cunt!

617
00:46:57,063 --> 00:46:58,325
No!

618
00:46:59,632 --> 00:47:00,963
Don't!

619
00:47:01,133 --> 00:47:03,192
- Come on!
- No, no!

620
00:47:04,503 --> 00:47:06,596
No, Breece, please!

621
00:47:06,872 --> 00:47:08,305
Come on!

622
00:47:12,712 --> 00:47:15,112
- Hey, Alma, what's up?
- I'm a little worried about Siobhan.

623
00:47:15,281 --> 00:47:18,341
She was supposed to show up for
the night shift an hour ago.

624
00:47:18,751 --> 00:47:21,083
- You tried her cell?
- I tried her everywhere.

625
00:47:21,253 --> 00:47:22,515
I was getting ready to call one of
the other deputies...

626
00:47:22,722 --> 00:47:23,882
to swing by her place.

627
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:26,650
No. No, that's fine.
I'll go.

628
00:48:01,327 --> 00:48:02,692
Siobhan.

629
00:48:05,331 --> 00:48:06,798
What's up, boss?

630
00:48:16,942 --> 00:48:19,240
You expecting someone else?

631
00:48:19,545 --> 00:48:21,513
I wasn't expecting anyone.

632
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:33,749
You want to talk about it?

633
00:48:33,926 --> 00:48:35,393
Not really.

634
00:48:37,696 --> 00:48:39,163
Okay.

635
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,630
Then just tell me
where he's staying.

636
00:48:51,243 --> 00:48:53,108
He's at the Motor Lodge.

637
00:48:55,114 --> 00:48:57,139
It's right near
his cousin's place.

638
00:49:16,435 --> 00:49:18,596
Fuckin' Dream House Barbie.

639
00:49:29,482 --> 00:49:30,847
Oh, that's so good.

640
00:49:31,016 --> 00:49:33,746
Oh, yeah. Oh, harder.

641
00:49:41,293 --> 00:49:42,293
Wow.

642
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:46,561
You got a fuckin'
problem, Barbie?

643
00:49:46,765 --> 00:49:48,027
No.

644
00:49:48,234 --> 00:49:50,168
Look who came to apologize.

645
00:51:32,037 --> 00:51:33,037
Come on.

646
00:51:33,906 --> 00:51:35,134
Come on!

647
00:51:35,507 --> 00:51:36,735
Come on!

648
00:52:13,012 --> 00:52:14,604
So...

649
00:52:14,813 --> 00:52:17,111
it turns out
Breece isn't staying...

650
00:52:17,316 --> 00:52:19,011
at the motor lodge after all.

651
00:52:20,653 --> 00:52:22,587
Sorry. My bad.

652
00:52:22,821 --> 00:52:24,686
I already called
for an ambulance.

653
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:26,657
Yeah, I heard.

654
00:52:36,969 --> 00:52:38,960
You hurt?

655
00:52:39,405 --> 00:52:40,599
I'm good.

656
00:52:46,578 --> 00:52:48,773
I know I'll lose
my badge for this.

657
00:52:49,915 --> 00:52:52,008
I'm on probation,
for fuck's sake.

658
00:52:57,489 --> 00:52:58,820
Go home.

659
00:52:59,024 --> 00:53:00,889
I'll clean this up.

660
00:53:01,093 --> 00:53:02,390
He'll tell 'em it was me.

661
00:53:02,561 --> 00:53:04,028
Yeah, I'll have a talk with him.

662
00:53:04,496 --> 00:53:06,293
He won't stick around.

663
00:53:12,404 --> 00:53:14,565
- Are you sure about this?
- Yeah.

664
00:53:18,477 --> 00:53:19,944
Go home.

665
00:53:28,787 --> 00:53:30,652
You know,
for the last four years,

666
00:53:30,989 --> 00:53:33,116
there wasn't a day
that I didn't imagine...

667
00:53:33,459 --> 00:53:35,290
some version of this playing out.

668
00:53:39,431 --> 00:53:41,331
How does it feel?

669
00:53:43,769 --> 00:53:45,464
Better than I imagined.

670
00:53:48,574 --> 00:53:50,041
Yeah.

671
00:53:53,312 --> 00:53:54,745
Thanks, boss.

672
00:53:54,947 --> 00:53:56,505
Don't mention it.

673
00:55:13,325 --> 00:55:14,815
Thanks.
