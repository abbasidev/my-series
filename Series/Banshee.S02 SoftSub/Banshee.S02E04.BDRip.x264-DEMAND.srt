1
00:00:37,431 --> 00:00:38,989
I didn't think you'd come.

2
00:00:40,701 --> 00:00:43,033
How are you?

3
00:00:46,107 --> 00:00:48,575
I don't know yet.

4
00:00:48,776 --> 00:00:50,903
- What about you?
- I don't know.

5
00:00:51,145 --> 00:00:53,113
I'm gonna need some time, okay?

6
00:01:00,021 --> 00:01:02,012
I'm ready
to tell you everything.

7
00:01:53,674 --> 00:01:55,608
Hi, Mom.

8
00:02:06,554 --> 00:02:08,385
Where's Gordon?

9
00:02:08,522 --> 00:02:11,082
I don't know.
Where's Ana?

10
00:02:22,236 --> 00:02:23,828
Yeah, Mom, where's Ana?

11
00:02:43,524 --> 00:02:45,754
Morning, ladies.

12
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,359
5:00 a.m.

13
00:02:47,561 --> 00:02:50,029
Time to get your fingers
out of your happy hole

14
00:02:50,231 --> 00:02:51,823
and give God the glory.

15
00:05:15,409 --> 00:05:17,604
You know, we've never
been formally introduced.

16
00:05:19,713 --> 00:05:22,841
- Lucas Hood.
- Nola.

17
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,711
Yeah, the chief's prodigal daughter.

18
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:28,447
I asked around. Small town.

19
00:05:30,157 --> 00:05:32,148
Heard you arrested
Tommy Littlestone.

20
00:05:32,359 --> 00:05:35,760
We questioned him.
He's not a killer.

21
00:05:35,963 --> 00:05:38,090
And you've got
Chayton locked up?

22
00:05:39,533 --> 00:05:41,194
That must have taken some doing.

23
00:05:41,402 --> 00:05:42,528
He a friend of yours?

24
00:05:42,736 --> 00:05:44,203
No.

25
00:05:44,405 --> 00:05:46,066
But he didn't do it either.

26
00:05:46,273 --> 00:05:48,468
Chayton is a killer,

27
00:05:48,676 --> 00:05:51,645
but he's also a purist.
He would never kill a Kinaho girl.

28
00:05:52,846 --> 00:05:54,279
You can't know that.

29
00:05:54,481 --> 00:05:55,971
Call it an expert opinion.

30
00:05:56,183 --> 00:05:59,414
Okay. So in your
expert opinion,

31
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,848
where should I be looking?

32
00:06:01,055 --> 00:06:02,886
Are you seriously
asking me that?

33
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:06,218
I mean, isn't that
where you'd be the expert?

34
00:06:17,638 --> 00:06:20,334
- He behaving?
- Yeah, so far.

35
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:22,304
Hey, black man.

36
00:06:23,711 --> 00:06:25,872
You're a disgrace to your race.

37
00:06:27,481 --> 00:06:29,915
They tore your ancestors
from their land,

38
00:06:30,117 --> 00:06:31,448
raped their women,

39
00:06:31,652 --> 00:06:34,587
and enslaved your people
for generations.

40
00:06:34,788 --> 00:06:38,087
And now you wear their uniform.

41
00:06:38,292 --> 00:06:40,317
Where's your dignity?

42
00:06:40,527 --> 00:06:42,427
How do you live with yourself?

43
00:06:44,765 --> 00:06:47,256
By getting scum like you
off the streets.

44
00:06:47,468 --> 00:06:49,060
I live with myself just fine.

45
00:06:52,406 --> 00:06:53,926
You get anything
from the state police?

46
00:06:53,941 --> 00:06:55,636
They searched the woods,
came up empty.

47
00:06:55,843 --> 00:06:56,867
Okay.

48
00:06:58,011 --> 00:06:59,603
We should press the Bowmans.

49
00:06:59,813 --> 00:07:01,110
Okay. They might know
more than they're saying.

50
00:07:01,315 --> 00:07:03,249
- Right.
- Or...

51
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,450
Or what?

52
00:07:04,618 --> 00:07:06,313
We should talk to the kids.

53
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,886
If Solomon is hiding,
one of his buddies might know where.

54
00:07:09,089 --> 00:07:10,784
- Great.
- Yeah, and I should talk to them.

55
00:07:12,192 --> 00:07:13,284
Alone.

56
00:07:15,496 --> 00:07:16,929
Look, Hood,

57
00:07:18,198 --> 00:07:20,358
it's hard enough to get the Amish
adults to talk to us,

58
00:07:20,401 --> 00:07:22,767
but the kids,
kids are off-limits.

59
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:25,734
And your... style,

60
00:07:25,939 --> 00:07:28,134
well, it won't work with them.

61
00:07:29,443 --> 00:07:30,535
But they'll talk to you?

62
00:07:30,744 --> 00:07:32,584
I've always had good
relations with the elders.

63
00:07:32,646 --> 00:07:34,409
They trust me.

64
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,812
Okay. Let me know
what turns up.

65
00:07:44,224 --> 00:07:46,192
You were looking for me?

66
00:07:46,393 --> 00:07:48,674
You went a little overboard
on this room, don't you think?

67
00:07:50,564 --> 00:07:52,657
Proctor is one man.

68
00:07:52,866 --> 00:07:56,962
You are the head of
the entire Kinaho Nation.

69
00:07:57,171 --> 00:08:01,005
It doesn't matter if you are weak or
you just appear weak.

70
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,732
There's blood in the water.

71
00:08:02,943 --> 00:08:05,639
And men like Proctor
and Hunter can smell it.

72
00:08:05,846 --> 00:08:08,576
I'm the chief of this tribe, Nola.

73
00:08:08,782 --> 00:08:11,910
I don't have the luxury of being able
to take out anyone who challenges me.

74
00:08:12,119 --> 00:08:13,586
Isn't that why
you keep me around?

75
00:08:17,758 --> 00:08:19,350
Get your feet off the table.

76
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,345
You've reached the voice mailbox of
Gordon Hopewell.

77
00:08:45,552 --> 00:08:47,679
Please leave a message.

78
00:08:47,888 --> 00:08:49,014
Gordon.

79
00:08:50,591 --> 00:08:52,923
It's me, again.

80
00:08:53,126 --> 00:08:54,650
I know you don't want
to talk to me

81
00:08:54,862 --> 00:08:57,023
and I understand that.
I do.

82
00:08:57,231 --> 00:09:00,325
- Good morning.
- Morning.

83
00:09:00,534 --> 00:09:02,695
Hey, where you going?

84
00:09:02,903 --> 00:09:04,461
Out.

85
00:09:04,671 --> 00:09:06,662
Last night I dreamt
that we were a family again.

86
00:09:07,341 --> 00:09:09,832
I know it was just a dream,
but I've got to believe

87
00:09:10,043 --> 00:09:13,035
that if I could find
the right words to say to you,

88
00:09:13,247 --> 00:09:15,807
you would find a way
to forgive me.

89
00:09:16,016 --> 00:09:18,348
I can survive this place.

90
00:09:18,819 --> 00:09:20,616
I can't live without you
and the kids.

91
00:09:20,821 --> 00:09:22,789
I won't survive that.

92
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:25,584
Please tell the kids
that I love them.

93
00:09:25,792 --> 00:09:28,454
That much at least
I hope you know is true.

94
00:09:33,467 --> 00:09:36,095
Oh, dude, I heard
this Indian chick

95
00:09:36,303 --> 00:09:38,294
had, like, the whole
back of her head busted in.

96
00:09:38,505 --> 00:09:40,871
Do you mean like "scalped"?

97
00:09:41,108 --> 00:09:43,702
Oh, my God.
That is so messed up.

98
00:09:43,944 --> 00:09:45,309
Oh, shit, the cops.

99
00:10:14,608 --> 00:10:17,543
- Hey.
- Sleep well?

100
00:10:17,744 --> 00:10:20,474
- Okay, what the fuck?
- Right back at you.

101
00:10:20,647 --> 00:10:22,478
Hey, man, I don't know
what kind of kinky shit you're into...

102
00:10:22,683 --> 00:10:24,548
Get up and brush your hair.

103
00:10:24,751 --> 00:10:26,309
Job's here to take your picture.

104
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,181
I am?

105
00:10:28,388 --> 00:10:30,185
Okay, who the fuck is this

106
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,358
and what the hell am I doing here?

107
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:34,789
Well, this is where
it gets interesting.

108
00:10:34,995 --> 00:10:36,895
Introduce yourself.

109
00:10:37,998 --> 00:10:39,295
Jason Hood.

110
00:10:41,468 --> 00:10:44,096
- Fuck me.
- Yeah.

111
00:10:44,304 --> 00:10:45,931
We got to make him someone else.

112
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:48,300
Well, the motherfucking
hits just keep on coming.

113
00:10:48,508 --> 00:10:49,873
- Nice tie.
- Shut up.

114
00:10:50,077 --> 00:10:51,044
And why aren't we killing him?

115
00:10:51,244 --> 00:10:53,109
- Hey, whoa.
- Shut up.

116
00:10:58,218 --> 00:10:59,480
Proctor?

117
00:11:01,188 --> 00:11:02,587
Morning, Chief.

118
00:11:02,789 --> 00:11:05,155
Paul Moon needed six surgeries.

119
00:11:05,359 --> 00:11:06,417
I'm sorry, Paul Moon?

120
00:11:06,627 --> 00:11:08,492
The man whose balls you crushed.

121
00:11:08,695 --> 00:11:11,391
Ah, I never caught his name.

122
00:11:11,598 --> 00:11:14,032
You came to my home,
you violated my privacy...

123
00:11:14,234 --> 00:11:16,065
You kidnapped my niece.

124
00:11:16,269 --> 00:11:18,863
Yeah, we can stand here
and trade accusations all day.

125
00:11:19,072 --> 00:11:21,973
The bottom line is your own people
have lost faith in you.

126
00:11:22,175 --> 00:11:23,802
And you have no one else
to blame but yourself.

127
00:11:24,011 --> 00:11:25,501
Hey, Alex. How are you?

128
00:11:25,712 --> 00:11:28,203
- What can I get you?
- You're a thug, Proctor.

129
00:11:28,415 --> 00:11:31,111
And when you go down,
and you will go down...

130
00:11:31,318 --> 00:11:32,318
no one's gonna miss you.

131
00:11:32,486 --> 00:11:33,817
I'm gonna come back later.

132
00:11:34,021 --> 00:11:36,114
You know what, Alex?

133
00:11:36,323 --> 00:11:38,757
You care too much
about what people think of you.

134
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,620
You'll never achieve
any power like that.

135
00:11:40,827 --> 00:11:43,557
Lie, cheat, extort...
and you call that power?

136
00:11:43,764 --> 00:11:46,995
That's not power,
that's just being a sociopath.

137
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,260
I'm running a business.
You're running a tribe.

138
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,461
The difference is
I've earned my spot.

139
00:11:52,673 --> 00:11:55,164
- You're a criminal.
- That's just semantics.

140
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:56,967
"Semantics."

141
00:11:58,245 --> 00:12:00,110
You're operating out of fear.

142
00:12:00,313 --> 00:12:02,213
Fear of losing your position.

143
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:03,781
Fear of the consequences.

144
00:12:03,984 --> 00:12:06,714
I'm not always
the smartest guy in the room,

145
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,387
but I'm fearless.

146
00:12:08,588 --> 00:12:11,148
I'm willing to do
whatever it takes to get what I want.

147
00:12:11,358 --> 00:12:13,451
And because of that,
people fear me.

148
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,491
Now, unless you can do that,

149
00:12:15,696 --> 00:12:18,096
your tribe will smell
the weakness on you

150
00:12:18,298 --> 00:12:20,459
and the stronger ones
will take you down.

151
00:12:21,902 --> 00:12:23,369
That's a great speech.

152
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:24,832
Thank you.

153
00:12:25,038 --> 00:12:26,630
But I'm not scared of you.

154
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,070
I'm not really getting
through to you, am I?

155
00:12:29,276 --> 00:12:32,143
This is my fault. I may have come on
too strong with you.

156
00:12:32,345 --> 00:12:36,475
And now you feel that anything other
than war is backing down.

157
00:12:36,683 --> 00:12:39,652
You know, we could have been great
partners, you and I, Alex.

158
00:12:39,853 --> 00:12:41,582
With the casino and all.

159
00:12:41,788 --> 00:12:43,779
Sometimes it takes more strength

160
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,958
to make peace than to fight.

161
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:47,649
Something your father taught me,

162
00:12:47,861 --> 00:12:50,261
God rest his soul.

163
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,267
You were just a tool
to my father.

164
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:58,938
He thought you were garbage.

165
00:12:59,139 --> 00:13:01,937
Why don't you go back
to the reservation, Alex?

166
00:13:02,142 --> 00:13:04,372
There, at least,
you are something.

167
00:13:04,578 --> 00:13:07,069
In the meantime, I have more
important things to deal with.

168
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,738
Don't worry.
We'll find your nephew.

169
00:13:15,422 --> 00:13:19,552
If anyone from your tribe
touches that boy,

170
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,923
I'll hold you
personally responsible.

171
00:13:26,266 --> 00:13:27,858
Maybe I should talk
to your sister.

172
00:13:28,068 --> 00:13:30,593
Seems to me she's the one
with the balls anyway.

173
00:13:43,283 --> 00:13:45,183
I should slit
your throat right here.

174
00:13:45,385 --> 00:13:48,320
Yeah? Now that
would take some balls.

175
00:13:48,522 --> 00:13:50,854
Mr. Proctor, Alex,
do I need to call the BSD?

176
00:13:51,057 --> 00:13:52,684
I have them on speed dial.

177
00:13:58,465 --> 00:14:01,525
That's okay, Daria.
Sorry, just a small disagreement.

178
00:14:03,036 --> 00:14:04,435
Here, that should cover that.

179
00:14:04,638 --> 00:14:06,697
I'm sorry, Daria.

180
00:14:09,309 --> 00:14:11,436
Here's the rest of
the Kinaho statements.

181
00:14:11,645 --> 00:14:13,237
Thanks.

182
00:14:16,917 --> 00:14:18,612
About last night...

183
00:14:18,819 --> 00:14:20,844
Oh, it's all good, boss.

184
00:14:23,623 --> 00:14:25,215
Hey, Hood, I...

185
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,425
- you got a minute?
- Yeah.

186
00:14:31,565 --> 00:14:32,565
What?

187
00:14:32,732 --> 00:14:36,065
This may be nothing,
but one of the Amish boys

188
00:14:36,269 --> 00:14:37,896
just told me
that Solomon had a friend

189
00:14:38,104 --> 00:14:40,368
named Daniel Moses
who left the fold.

190
00:14:40,574 --> 00:14:42,166
Guess he was a bit
of a problem child.

191
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,455
He ran away a few times.
They kept dragging him back.

192
00:14:44,644 --> 00:14:46,669
But the last time he ran,
he was 18, so they just let him go.

193
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,200
- You know where he lives?
- Yeah.

194
00:14:48,348 --> 00:14:50,282
Kid said he's squatting in
a building over on Delafield.

195
00:14:50,483 --> 00:14:51,483
- Let's go.
- All right.

196
00:15:00,994 --> 00:15:02,655
What the fuck?!

197
00:15:08,768 --> 00:15:12,727
Were you or were you not supposed
to stay in your motherfucking room?

198
00:15:12,939 --> 00:15:14,201
I got hungry.

199
00:15:14,407 --> 00:15:16,136
Get in the fucking car.

200
00:15:16,343 --> 00:15:17,970
I kind of don't want to.

201
00:15:20,213 --> 00:15:22,494
Bitch, I should be shooting your dumb
white ass right now,

202
00:15:22,515 --> 00:15:24,608
but instead I'm offering
you a ride.

203
00:15:24,818 --> 00:15:27,844
So show some fucking gratitude
and get in the fucking car

204
00:15:28,054 --> 00:15:31,182
or I will run you into a wall and say
my foot slipped off the clutch.

205
00:16:00,587 --> 00:16:01,918
Daniel Moses?

206
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,555
Oh, great.

207
00:16:09,596 --> 00:16:10,790
Hey!

208
00:16:15,201 --> 00:16:16,681
- Hey, hey, hey.
- I'm not going back.

209
00:16:16,836 --> 00:16:17,836
I'm not going back.

210
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,701
- I'm not going back.
- I'm not gonna take you back.

211
00:16:21,908 --> 00:16:23,748
I'm 18 years old
and you can't make me go back.

212
00:16:23,944 --> 00:16:25,070
- Hey!
- We're not... Hey!

213
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:26,905
God damn it!
We're not taking you back.

214
00:16:27,113 --> 00:16:29,673
That's not why we're here.
We're looking for Solomon Bowman.

215
00:16:30,817 --> 00:16:32,876
Solomon?
Why? What's wrong?

216
00:16:33,086 --> 00:16:35,020
- You haven't heard?
- No.

217
00:16:35,221 --> 00:16:37,985
Solomon's missing.
We know he's a friend of yours.

218
00:16:38,191 --> 00:16:39,419
We thought maybe he
was crashing with you.

219
00:16:39,626 --> 00:16:40,923
I haven't seen him in weeks.

220
00:16:41,127 --> 00:16:42,492
Listen to me.

221
00:16:42,696 --> 00:16:44,630
There's other people
looking for him, okay?

222
00:16:44,831 --> 00:16:46,799
- If they find him before we do...
- I'm telling you the truth.

223
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,060
If you don't believe me,
you can come check my place.

224
00:17:04,951 --> 00:17:07,215
Fix the place up yourself?

225
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,478
Yeah.

226
00:17:09,923 --> 00:17:11,948
- You like to read?
- Yeah.

227
00:17:13,393 --> 00:17:14,393
Salinger?

228
00:17:14,561 --> 00:17:17,086
They don't let you read
that at the Amish school?

229
00:17:17,297 --> 00:17:19,731
No, they don't let us
read anything.

230
00:17:19,933 --> 00:17:20,933
Really?

231
00:17:21,101 --> 00:17:22,966
It's just a way to keep
us trapped on the farm.

232
00:17:23,169 --> 00:17:27,538
Ignorant, unable to engage
the outside world.

233
00:17:27,741 --> 00:17:30,710
So whenever I went to town,
I'd buy one or two books

234
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:34,346
and hide them in the crawlspace
beneath the house.

235
00:17:34,547 --> 00:17:35,809
You ever get caught?

236
00:17:37,684 --> 00:17:40,118
There was this teacher
at our school.

237
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,686
Even though we stopped going
to school after eighth grade,

238
00:17:42,889 --> 00:17:47,019
he was still responsible
for our religious training.

239
00:17:48,094 --> 00:17:50,119
He caught me reading
Lord of the Flies

240
00:17:51,865 --> 00:17:54,333
and he just went off on me.

241
00:17:54,534 --> 00:17:56,297
Punching me, kicking me,

242
00:17:56,503 --> 00:17:57,902
screaming like a maniac

243
00:17:58,138 --> 00:18:01,005
that my mind
was "poisoned by filth."

244
00:18:03,643 --> 00:18:05,406
Patia.

245
00:18:05,612 --> 00:18:08,581
I heard what happened to you.
I am so sorry.

246
00:18:08,782 --> 00:18:10,613
- You sent me into the woods.
- I know.

247
00:18:10,817 --> 00:18:12,648
My mom, she made me
come back home

248
00:18:12,852 --> 00:18:15,343
after what your uncle
did to those Kinaho men.

249
00:18:15,555 --> 00:18:16,955
Well, someone knew
where to find me.

250
00:18:17,123 --> 00:18:19,284
I didn't tell anybody.
I promise.

251
00:18:20,593 --> 00:18:22,220
I wasn't a rebel or anything.

252
00:18:22,462 --> 00:18:27,126
I wasn't having sex
or doing drugs.

253
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:28,766
I just wanted to read.

254
00:18:30,336 --> 00:18:31,564
So I ran away.

255
00:18:31,771 --> 00:18:34,763
Patia, what were you
going to tell me yesterday?

256
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:36,740
Is that normal?

257
00:18:36,976 --> 00:18:39,570
Any other teachers hit you?

258
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:42,407
No, this guy was kind of a...

259
00:18:42,615 --> 00:18:44,139
religious nut.

260
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,510
And that's saying something
considering where I'm from.

261
00:18:55,328 --> 00:18:57,353
Please.

262
00:18:57,564 --> 00:18:58,792
Just tell me what you know.

263
00:18:58,998 --> 00:19:00,158
He'd look for me,

264
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,425
demanding I repent.

265
00:19:02,635 --> 00:19:05,365
Getting rough with me
when I wouldn't.

266
00:19:05,572 --> 00:19:08,837
I told Solomon that if things ever
got too bad, he could come here.

267
00:19:09,042 --> 00:19:12,409
Wait, wait. So this teacher was
picking on Solomon as well?

268
00:19:12,612 --> 00:19:14,045
Yeah,

269
00:19:14,514 --> 00:19:16,539
Solomon has his sister.

270
00:19:16,749 --> 00:19:19,445
The teacher, he's twisted.

271
00:19:20,487 --> 00:19:23,923
- And he hates Solomon.
- Why?

272
00:19:24,124 --> 00:19:27,457
I don't know. Maybe because
he's your brother.

273
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,686
They were worried he was
gonna go the same way.

274
00:19:30,897 --> 00:19:33,695
Like the whole bloodline
was cursed or something.

275
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,800
Superstitious bullshit.

276
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,270
Uncle...

277
00:19:39,472 --> 00:19:41,133
Then Solomon met this Indian girl.

278
00:19:41,508 --> 00:19:43,499
He tried to keep it a secret,

279
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:46,474
but word always
gets out, you know?

280
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:50,376
So this teacher,
what's his name?

281
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,414
Jonah Lambrecht?

282
00:19:52,619 --> 00:19:55,850
- Yes.
- Sheriff Lucas Hood.

283
00:19:56,055 --> 00:19:57,147
Can I come in?

284
00:19:57,357 --> 00:19:59,257
Yes. Yes, of course.

285
00:19:59,459 --> 00:20:01,757
It's about the boy,
Solomon, right?

286
00:20:02,962 --> 00:20:04,122
That's right.

287
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,528
Please, have a seat.

288
00:20:09,736 --> 00:20:11,533
I'll cook up some water.

289
00:20:17,343 --> 00:20:19,573
It's terrible about the girl.

290
00:20:23,349 --> 00:20:24,782
How can I be of help?

291
00:20:26,052 --> 00:20:27,519
You live alone?

292
00:20:29,589 --> 00:20:31,682
Yes, I know it's a bit messy.

293
00:20:31,891 --> 00:20:34,189
No, no. It's not that.

294
00:20:34,394 --> 00:20:36,521
I just didn't realize

295
00:20:36,729 --> 00:20:39,664
there was Amish bachelors.

296
00:20:39,866 --> 00:20:41,925
My wife Sara died

297
00:20:42,135 --> 00:20:43,762
a few years
after we were married.

298
00:20:44,871 --> 00:20:46,566
I'm sorry.

299
00:20:46,773 --> 00:20:48,172
You have any kids?

300
00:20:49,576 --> 00:20:51,203
No.

301
00:20:51,411 --> 00:20:54,073
She'd always been a frail woman.

302
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,942
Couldn't have any children.

303
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:59,209
But I loved her very much.

304
00:20:59,419 --> 00:21:00,977
So you never remarried?

305
00:21:01,187 --> 00:21:03,985
No. When she died,
I just...

306
00:21:05,725 --> 00:21:06,885
I don't know.

307
00:21:07,093 --> 00:21:08,958
I lost interest
in getting married.

308
00:21:10,396 --> 00:21:14,332
Once you've loved
someone a certain way,

309
00:21:15,435 --> 00:21:18,404
you know you'll never
love another like that.

310
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:26,137
So tell me about Solomon.

311
00:21:26,346 --> 00:21:27,870
He was your student, right?

312
00:21:28,081 --> 00:21:29,081
Yes.

313
00:21:30,116 --> 00:21:31,242
A few years ago.

314
00:21:32,285 --> 00:21:34,253
He's a bright boy.

315
00:21:34,454 --> 00:21:35,454
Maybe a bit rebellious,

316
00:21:35,622 --> 00:21:37,283
but...

317
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:39,048
a sweet boy.

318
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,060
I don't think for one minute
that he hurt that girl.

319
00:21:43,263 --> 00:21:44,730
What do you mean "rebellious"?

320
00:21:45,765 --> 00:21:48,199
Well, Solomon was curious.

321
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:53,871
He couldn't always
accept the restrictions of our faith.

322
00:21:54,073 --> 00:21:55,700
It's a big world out there

323
00:21:56,943 --> 00:21:58,205
and boys will be curious.

324
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:01,308
I know I was.

325
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:06,546
So, what, it was your job
to bring him back into line?

326
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:10,345
No, no, no.
That falls to the parents.

327
00:22:10,556 --> 00:22:14,048
I'm simply there to teach them
the precepts of our faith.

328
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,125
And as a part of this teaching,

329
00:22:16,329 --> 00:22:18,797
you ever get physical with them?

330
00:22:18,998 --> 00:22:19,998
I'm sorry?

331
00:22:20,199 --> 00:22:22,724
You ever hit them?

332
00:22:22,935 --> 00:22:24,664
- No.
- No?

333
00:22:24,871 --> 00:22:26,338
Of course not.

334
00:22:27,373 --> 00:22:29,341
We do not believe
in violence of any kind.

335
00:22:29,542 --> 00:22:30,542
Oh.

336
00:22:32,445 --> 00:22:35,175
'Cause that's not what
Daniel Moses told me.

337
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,351
Yes.

338
00:22:45,358 --> 00:22:46,882
That was a mistake.

339
00:22:48,027 --> 00:22:50,393
I think about Daniel a lot.

340
00:22:50,596 --> 00:22:53,588
At the time, I told myself
it was self-defense.

341
00:22:54,801 --> 00:22:57,827
After all, it was he
who attacked me.

342
00:22:58,037 --> 00:23:00,437
But I would do anything
to see that boy again.

343
00:23:02,342 --> 00:23:04,037
To tell him how sorry I am.

344
00:23:05,311 --> 00:23:07,245
To ask him to forgive me, and...

345
00:23:10,983 --> 00:23:12,746
to ask him to come home.

346
00:23:16,255 --> 00:23:18,052
Excuse me.

347
00:23:22,095 --> 00:23:23,426
You hurt your leg?

348
00:23:23,629 --> 00:23:27,429
It's an old injury.
I got kicked by a horse.

349
00:23:27,633 --> 00:23:28,895
So why is it still bleeding?

350
00:23:37,677 --> 00:23:39,872
What happened
to no violence, Jonah?

351
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:41,410
You're under arrest.

352
00:23:41,614 --> 00:23:43,377
You have the right
to remain silent...

353
00:24:32,331 --> 00:24:35,232
Where's the boy?
Where's the boy?

354
00:24:41,741 --> 00:24:42,741
Where's the boy?

355
00:24:46,112 --> 00:24:47,112
Where is he?

356
00:24:54,353 --> 00:24:55,980
He's not going to tell you.

357
00:24:57,457 --> 00:25:00,017
His psychotic belief in his own
righteousness is too strong.

358
00:25:01,894 --> 00:25:03,486
So what do you suggest?

359
00:25:08,901 --> 00:25:10,630
Just leave us alone for a bit.

360
00:25:14,807 --> 00:25:16,447
You know, I'm finding
everybody's reaction

361
00:25:16,542 --> 00:25:19,568
to this kid disturbingly
underreactive.

362
00:25:19,779 --> 00:25:22,441
We should be digging
a motherfucking hole.

363
00:25:22,648 --> 00:25:26,277
Look, he's just a kid
looking for a second chance.

364
00:25:26,486 --> 00:25:29,455
And when did we become
Touched by an Angel?

365
00:25:30,723 --> 00:25:33,624
- It is strange, though.
- What's that?

366
00:25:33,826 --> 00:25:36,556
Well, of all the chairs
he could have chosen,

367
00:25:36,762 --> 00:25:39,253
he chose the same chair
his father chose

368
00:25:39,465 --> 00:25:40,796
the day he got killed.

369
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,901
- So, Job.
- "Job"?

370
00:25:44,103 --> 00:25:45,900
When do you think
my fake ID will be ready?

371
00:25:48,241 --> 00:25:50,072
Fake ID, hmm?

372
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,868
Bitch, what you think this is?

373
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:55,547
This ain't some phony
Virginia driver's license

374
00:25:55,748 --> 00:25:57,477
you're buying for 50 bucks
in the back of a head shop

375
00:25:57,683 --> 00:25:59,913
so you can host a kegger
in your backyard

376
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:02,019
and date-rape the motherfucking
prom queen.

377
00:26:02,221 --> 00:26:04,280
I'm giving you a new name,
credit history,

378
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:07,789
Social Security number and
a motherfucking birth certificate.

379
00:26:07,994 --> 00:26:11,555
I am turning you into a whole new
goddamn human being.

380
00:26:11,764 --> 00:26:13,698
Okay.
Jesus, I'm sorry.

381
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,266
And let me tell you
something else.

382
00:26:16,469 --> 00:26:19,597
Once I have performed
this little miracle,

383
00:26:19,805 --> 00:26:22,035
you are going to disappear

384
00:26:22,241 --> 00:26:24,903
and we are not going to see or hear
from your punk ass again

385
00:26:25,111 --> 00:26:26,840
because if you
show up a second time

386
00:26:27,046 --> 00:26:29,139
looking for a handout
because you fucked up again,

387
00:26:29,348 --> 00:26:31,339
I will personally put a bullet
between your eyes.

388
00:26:33,219 --> 00:26:36,347
And just for that,
I'm gonna name you Marion.

389
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:45,727
Now, you may not
be aware, Jonah...

390
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,898
but there is a debate currently
raging in civil society

391
00:26:51,103 --> 00:26:53,264
about the efficacy of torture.

392
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,833
Now, I happen to fall
on the side of those

393
00:26:57,043 --> 00:26:59,068
who believe that pain
is a tool...

394
00:27:00,947 --> 00:27:02,972
like any other.

395
00:27:05,985 --> 00:27:10,115
And where pain will work...

396
00:27:15,027 --> 00:27:17,552
it's far and away the most
efficient tool for the job.

397
00:27:29,709 --> 00:27:31,870
Just tap your foot
when you're ready to talk.

398
00:28:12,852 --> 00:28:15,412
There's an unused silo
on the adjacent property.

399
00:28:15,621 --> 00:28:18,055
He's got Solomon locked away.

400
00:28:19,458 --> 00:28:22,825
Oh, it took me a few
extra teeth to get this.

401
00:28:28,267 --> 00:28:30,599
Fuck that. Let's drive.

402
00:28:32,738 --> 00:28:35,104
- You killed him?
- No.

403
00:28:35,307 --> 00:28:37,468
But you should probably
call an ambulance.

404
00:28:40,346 --> 00:28:41,711
Yeah, I probably should.

405
00:28:48,187 --> 00:28:49,415
Solomon?

406
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,566
God damn it. Hey.

407
00:29:14,213 --> 00:29:15,612
Shit.

408
00:29:37,136 --> 00:29:39,195
- I found him.
- Oh, God.

409
00:29:39,405 --> 00:29:41,965
Solomon.
Hey, Solomon.

410
00:29:42,174 --> 00:29:43,732
- Solomon.
- Hey.

411
00:29:43,943 --> 00:29:45,467
- Solomon.
- Hey.

412
00:29:48,714 --> 00:29:50,238
Solomon.

413
00:29:50,516 --> 00:29:52,040
It's okay.

414
00:29:58,691 --> 00:30:00,625
I got you.
I got you.

415
00:30:00,826 --> 00:30:01,826
Okay.

416
00:30:11,871 --> 00:30:13,668
I love you. It's okay.

417
00:30:13,873 --> 00:30:15,773
It's okay.

418
00:30:20,312 --> 00:30:21,404
It's okay.

419
00:31:05,591 --> 00:31:07,388
I love you.

420
00:31:07,593 --> 00:31:08,821
It's okay.

421
00:31:10,296 --> 00:31:12,127
It's okay. It's okay.

422
00:31:19,738 --> 00:31:21,035
Solomon!

423
00:31:48,901 --> 00:31:51,301
When your own grandson was lost,

424
00:31:51,503 --> 00:31:53,403
you cowered and prayed to God,

425
00:31:53,606 --> 00:31:57,542
and the Almighty would have left him
dead beneath your feet.

426
00:31:57,743 --> 00:31:59,768
Well, maybe God
just doesn't love you

427
00:31:59,979 --> 00:32:01,259
as much as you'd like
to believe.

428
00:32:01,447 --> 00:32:03,415
Maybe He finds it
laughably arrogant

429
00:32:03,616 --> 00:32:05,607
for you to think
you even know His will.

430
00:32:05,818 --> 00:32:07,376
God brought him back to us.

431
00:32:07,586 --> 00:32:10,783
Yeah, you go and see what
I did to Jonah Lambrecht.

432
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:13,481
You'll see that God
had nothing to do with it.

433
00:32:14,793 --> 00:32:16,590
Nothing.

434
00:32:16,795 --> 00:32:17,955
Let's go.

435
00:32:32,845 --> 00:32:34,176
You're gonna be okay.

436
00:33:06,078 --> 00:33:07,375
All right.

437
00:33:08,781 --> 00:33:10,248
Here's the paperwork on him.

438
00:33:10,449 --> 00:33:12,007
It's two hours
to Jefferson County.

439
00:33:12,184 --> 00:33:13,651
Sheriff's Department
will meet you at the county line.

440
00:33:13,852 --> 00:33:15,786
All right. See you later.

441
00:33:17,656 --> 00:33:20,147
Christ, he's a big one.
Stay alert, huh?

442
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:21,792
We will.

443
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,905
Hey, what the fuck?!

444
00:34:17,816 --> 00:34:19,078
Jesus Christ.

445
00:34:20,686 --> 00:34:22,347
Hey, cut that shit out now.

446
00:34:22,554 --> 00:34:25,148
Hey, you want to fucking
get tased again? Stop.

447
00:34:28,961 --> 00:34:30,519
Stop it right now.

448
00:34:30,729 --> 00:34:32,129
This is Deputy Yawners
with the BSD.

449
00:34:32,264 --> 00:34:34,494
Shit. Stop that.
You want me to shoot you?

450
00:34:59,392 --> 00:35:01,155
It's happy green.
It makes you happy.

451
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,918
Flynn, where did you
get this stuff?

452
00:35:03,129 --> 00:35:04,596
Actually, I can't tell you.

453
00:35:06,065 --> 00:35:08,625
Come on, Deva.
Please, baby, pick up.

454
00:35:13,005 --> 00:35:15,667
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

455
00:35:15,875 --> 00:35:17,308
- It's amazing, right?
- Watch this.

456
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:19,478
Hey, it's Deva.
Leave a message.

457
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:21,510
Or don't. Bye.

458
00:35:23,516 --> 00:35:25,143
Hi, Deva. It's Mom.

459
00:35:26,285 --> 00:35:27,718
I don't even know
where to start.

460
00:35:27,887 --> 00:35:29,479
I have so much to say.

461
00:35:31,157 --> 00:35:33,148
I just want you to know
that I love you.

462
00:35:35,061 --> 00:35:38,690
That I always have.
That part was never a lie.

463
00:35:38,898 --> 00:35:41,389
All I ever wanted was
for you and Max to be happy

464
00:35:41,601 --> 00:35:43,125
and to feel safe.

465
00:35:44,303 --> 00:35:46,168
When I come home,

466
00:35:46,372 --> 00:35:49,637
you can ask me anything
and I'll tell you the truth.

467
00:35:49,842 --> 00:35:51,901
Baby, we can find our way back.

468
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:55,138
Just don't give up on me.

469
00:35:55,348 --> 00:35:56,815
Okay?

470
00:35:57,016 --> 00:35:58,347
I love you.

471
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,013
Tell Max I love him, too.

472
00:36:11,063 --> 00:36:12,530
Thanks.

473
00:36:28,414 --> 00:36:30,507
Is there something
I can help you with?

474
00:36:32,718 --> 00:36:34,151
You look so sad.

475
00:36:36,622 --> 00:36:38,419
You have no idea.

476
00:36:41,694 --> 00:36:43,662
Want some company?

477
00:36:47,566 --> 00:36:49,090
You know,

478
00:36:49,301 --> 00:36:51,963
any other night
I would tell you to get lost.

479
00:37:03,482 --> 00:37:05,279
What the hell happened to him?

480
00:37:05,484 --> 00:37:07,076
He resisted arrest.

481
00:37:09,588 --> 00:37:11,078
Strenuously.

482
00:37:21,434 --> 00:37:22,526
No.

483
00:37:22,735 --> 00:37:23,963
Don't do this, Father.

484
00:37:24,136 --> 00:37:25,364
You did this.

485
00:37:25,604 --> 00:37:28,801
Daddy! Mama!

486
00:37:29,008 --> 00:37:31,875
Don't let them do this to me!

487
00:37:33,913 --> 00:37:35,210
Did you get a confession?

488
00:37:35,414 --> 00:37:37,814
Don't need one.
We got the boy.

489
00:37:38,017 --> 00:37:39,712
How is the boy?

490
00:37:42,221 --> 00:37:44,746
He'll give you everything you need
to pin the murder on him.

491
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,126
Well, you did a number on him.

492
00:37:50,329 --> 00:37:51,489
Congratulations, Sheriff.

493
00:37:51,697 --> 00:37:53,597
Your department needed this win.

494
00:37:55,434 --> 00:37:56,594
Here to serve.

495
00:38:16,756 --> 00:38:17,984
I hope it hurts like hell.

496
00:38:26,031 --> 00:38:27,931
You heard from Emmett
or Siobhan?

497
00:38:28,134 --> 00:38:29,226
No, why?

498
00:38:29,435 --> 00:38:32,268
I can't seem to get them on
their cells or on the radio.

499
00:38:36,375 --> 00:38:38,900
You know what? They still got
another half an hour.

500
00:38:41,313 --> 00:38:44,339
- Keep trying.
- Yeah. Yeah, I will.

501
00:39:06,205 --> 00:39:07,433
Be still.

502
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:27,523
What is it with
white people and chains?

503
00:39:29,261 --> 00:39:32,025
From the day you got here,

504
00:39:32,231 --> 00:39:34,324
you've been locking people up.

505
00:39:42,608 --> 00:39:44,667
Tell your sheriff

506
00:39:44,877 --> 00:39:46,504
I'll see him soon.

507
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,589
Hit the dirt, cop!

508
00:40:05,798 --> 00:40:08,096
Get down! Now!

509
00:40:09,401 --> 00:40:11,266
Drop it!

510
00:40:16,976 --> 00:40:18,102
Here you go, black man.

511
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:19,538
I think these are yours.

512
00:40:35,628 --> 00:40:36,628
It's strong, yo.

513
00:40:36,795 --> 00:40:38,524
I'm bumming.

514
00:40:38,731 --> 00:40:40,358
Look at him in that hat.

515
00:40:40,566 --> 00:40:42,193
- Oh, my God.
- It's the cops.

516
00:40:42,401 --> 00:40:44,096
- Oh, shit.
- Fuck.

517
00:40:46,872 --> 00:40:49,466
- It's fine. Just stop.
- How you doing, Officer?

518
00:40:50,576 --> 00:40:52,544
We weren't doing anything, man.

519
00:40:52,745 --> 00:40:55,213
Your parents know you're
out here getting high?

520
00:40:55,414 --> 00:40:57,006
Allegedly high.

521
00:40:57,216 --> 00:40:59,309
- Go home.
- Don't have to tell me twice.

522
00:40:59,518 --> 00:41:00,883
Now.

523
00:41:02,421 --> 00:41:03,581
Deva.

524
00:41:05,057 --> 00:41:07,548
Let's go, dude.
Come on.

525
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,523
Come on.
Come on.

526
00:41:12,798 --> 00:41:13,924
You guys are idiots.

527
00:41:22,773 --> 00:41:24,604
You know, you really
shouldn't smoke pot.

528
00:41:26,443 --> 00:41:27,535
Yeah, I know.

529
00:41:28,879 --> 00:41:30,073
Fair enough.

530
00:41:32,616 --> 00:41:34,413
You angry at your mom?

531
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,160
You don't know how I feel.

532
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:40,586
No, but that's what
you're doing, right?

533
00:41:42,793 --> 00:41:43,817
Trying to hurt her.

534
00:41:45,896 --> 00:41:47,921
It won't work.

535
00:41:48,132 --> 00:41:50,600
Just make more mess.

536
00:41:50,801 --> 00:41:52,359
What makes you the expert?

537
00:41:52,569 --> 00:41:53,831
Do you have any kids?

538
00:41:57,141 --> 00:41:58,267
No.

539
00:42:00,778 --> 00:42:02,609
But I know how to make a mess.

540
00:42:04,281 --> 00:42:06,681
I believe it.

541
00:42:06,884 --> 00:42:08,351
There's your dad.

542
00:42:16,059 --> 00:42:17,321
Thanks for the lemonade.

543
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:36,272
So I suppose
congratulations are in order.

544
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,243
You're a father.

545
00:42:41,251 --> 00:42:44,584
I have to say, when it was about
the money, I got it.

546
00:42:44,788 --> 00:42:47,382
When it was about true love
gone tragically wrong,

547
00:42:47,591 --> 00:42:49,354
- I even got that.
- Yeah.

548
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:52,893
But if you think
you're gonna hang around here,

549
00:42:53,096 --> 00:42:54,893
take a couple parenting classes,

550
00:42:55,098 --> 00:42:59,159
make all this evil shit right,
you are sadly mistaken.

551
00:43:00,671 --> 00:43:03,834
Bad shit happens
to people standing too close to you.

552
00:43:06,243 --> 00:43:08,575
If you care for them,

553
00:43:08,779 --> 00:43:10,770
you have to get out
of their lives.

554
00:43:15,919 --> 00:43:18,046
Take the diamonds to New York.

555
00:43:18,255 --> 00:43:21,156
Fence them. Get what you can.

556
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:23,952
Say amen, somebody.

557
00:43:24,161 --> 00:43:25,651
The man has come to his senses.

558
00:43:25,863 --> 00:43:28,093
Call me when you're done.

559
00:43:30,968 --> 00:43:33,300
I'll come up.

560
00:43:33,504 --> 00:43:35,199
Anywhere but here, baby.

561
00:43:35,405 --> 00:43:38,135
Anywhere on this big,
beautiful planet but here.

562
00:43:42,913 --> 00:43:44,039
Hey.

563
00:43:46,049 --> 00:43:47,914
You okay?

564
00:43:48,252 --> 00:43:50,379
Jesus Christ. Jesus.

565
00:43:52,322 --> 00:43:55,291
- We got to get you checked out.
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

566
00:43:55,492 --> 00:43:58,859
I didn't realize it was this bad
or I would have come.

567
00:43:59,062 --> 00:44:00,062
I know.

568
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:03,827
For a moment,

569
00:44:05,903 --> 00:44:07,564
after the crash...

570
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:11,872
I thought I was dead.

571
00:44:15,612 --> 00:44:18,706
Come on.
I'm gonna take you home.

572
00:44:18,916 --> 00:44:20,247
Come on.

573
00:44:38,869 --> 00:44:41,030
Here to go another round?

574
00:44:41,238 --> 00:44:42,535
No.

575
00:44:42,739 --> 00:44:44,764
I said something to you earlier.

576
00:44:44,975 --> 00:44:48,069
That it takes more
strength to make peace than to fight.

577
00:44:48,278 --> 00:44:51,839
I think I need to learn
that lesson again myself.

578
00:44:52,049 --> 00:44:55,075
I hope you'll consider this
an adequate peace offering.

579
00:44:57,154 --> 00:44:59,952
Those are seven teeth
of the man who murdered the girl.

580
00:45:00,157 --> 00:45:02,148
The rest of him
is in lockup in town.

581
00:45:02,359 --> 00:45:03,883
Why don't you make
a necklace of them?

582
00:45:05,228 --> 00:45:07,492
Go tell your people
you brought peace on the land.

583
00:45:08,765 --> 00:45:11,632
I think you'll be pleased to know
he wasn't one of yours.

584
00:45:15,339 --> 00:45:16,863
"And thine eye shall not pity,

585
00:45:17,074 --> 00:45:18,166
but life shall go for life.

586
00:45:18,375 --> 00:45:21,469
Eye for eye,
tooth for tooth."

587
00:45:33,323 --> 00:45:34,843
This doesn't change
anything, you know.

588
00:45:34,992 --> 00:45:37,392
I don't like Proctor
any more than you do,

589
00:45:37,594 --> 00:45:40,119
but he may be right.

590
00:45:40,330 --> 00:45:41,456
This isn't a time to fight.

591
00:45:41,665 --> 00:45:44,896
Alex, you will not
get into bed with Proctor.

592
00:45:45,102 --> 00:45:46,467
Hunter's working
the council hard.

593
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:48,763
I can't afford
another embarrassment.

594
00:45:48,972 --> 00:45:50,371
You said it yourself,
there's blood in the water.

595
00:45:50,574 --> 00:45:52,701
Yeah, that's right.
So be the shark.

596
00:45:55,212 --> 00:45:57,510
Be the fucking shark, Alex.

597
00:45:58,949 --> 00:46:01,645
What are you gonna do, Nola?
You gonna hit me?

598
00:46:24,241 --> 00:46:26,209
I think I was wrong

599
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:28,173
to ask you to stick around.

600
00:46:28,412 --> 00:46:31,245
After everything
that's happened,

601
00:46:31,448 --> 00:46:33,541
everything you went through,

602
00:46:35,152 --> 00:46:36,517
I should have
thought about that.

603
00:46:41,391 --> 00:46:43,791
I'm sorry,
but you don't belong here anymore.

604
00:47:01,545 --> 00:47:02,603
Yeah.

605
00:47:04,448 --> 00:47:06,211
I never did.

606
00:47:06,416 --> 00:47:07,713
No, I guess you didn't.

607
00:47:22,265 --> 00:47:24,256
Where you gonna go?

608
00:47:24,468 --> 00:47:26,527
- Nola.
- Don't.

609
00:47:27,604 --> 00:47:28,935
You're finally being a chief.

610
00:47:29,139 --> 00:47:31,198
Don't ruin it by
second-guessing yourself.

611
00:48:04,741 --> 00:48:06,038
Nice outfit.

612
00:48:06,243 --> 00:48:08,234
Right back at you.

613
00:48:08,445 --> 00:48:09,503
Thank you.

614
00:48:24,528 --> 00:48:27,156
- Where are we going?
- You have a visitor.

615
00:48:27,364 --> 00:48:28,797
This way.

616
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,568
- In there?
- In there.

617
00:48:34,805 --> 00:48:35,863
Go on.

618
00:49:08,572 --> 00:49:09,800
Sit down.

619
00:49:17,914 --> 00:49:19,506
You're surprised to see me?

620
00:49:21,351 --> 00:49:22,477
No.

621
00:49:23,954 --> 00:49:25,751
Not really.

622
00:49:25,956 --> 00:49:27,617
It seems you and me

623
00:49:29,059 --> 00:49:31,220
are both very hard to kill.

624
00:49:32,729 --> 00:49:35,391
It's a family trait.

625
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:37,260
What are you doing here?

626
00:49:38,335 --> 00:49:40,360
I see your mother

627
00:49:41,872 --> 00:49:43,863
every time I look at you.

628
00:49:45,909 --> 00:49:47,934
It warms me.

629
00:49:49,613 --> 00:49:51,945
And it kills me at the same time.

630
00:49:54,217 --> 00:49:55,912
When I met your mother,

631
00:49:56,119 --> 00:49:59,020
she was with another man.

632
00:50:00,223 --> 00:50:02,783
But I courted her shamelessly.

633
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:05,953
Relentlessly.

634
00:50:06,296 --> 00:50:07,786
At first

635
00:50:08,999 --> 00:50:10,830
she thought I was insane.

636
00:50:12,802 --> 00:50:15,828
And then later she knew
I was insane.

637
00:50:17,841 --> 00:50:21,106
But there was
no questioning my love.

638
00:50:23,613 --> 00:50:25,444
Love.

639
00:50:25,649 --> 00:50:27,378
Truth.

640
00:50:27,584 --> 00:50:29,518
Insanity.

641
00:50:29,719 --> 00:50:32,415
These are all
more connected than people...

642
00:50:32,622 --> 00:50:34,749
want to believe.

643
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:38,727
I made...

644
00:50:38,929 --> 00:50:41,921
I made mistakes, Anastasia.

645
00:50:42,132 --> 00:50:44,123
Too many.

646
00:50:44,334 --> 00:50:47,030
And too terrible to forgive.

647
00:50:49,773 --> 00:50:51,798
But I wanted to tell you

648
00:50:52,008 --> 00:50:54,169
before it's too late...

649
00:50:55,378 --> 00:50:57,972
that what you think...

650
00:50:58,181 --> 00:51:00,479
was insanity...

651
00:51:03,086 --> 00:51:05,816
was the greatest love...

652
00:51:06,923 --> 00:51:08,515
I have ever known.

653
00:51:16,566 --> 00:51:18,056
This is the last time...

654
00:51:19,803 --> 00:51:20,895
we will see one another.
