1
00:00:25,923 --> 00:00:27,322
You and Anastasia.

2
00:00:28,259 --> 00:00:30,090
- I think he knows.
- He doesn't know.

3
00:00:30,494 --> 00:00:31,825
You will suffer.

4
00:00:36,133 --> 00:00:38,067
Just breathe.

5
00:00:44,942 --> 00:00:46,933
So you're a pretend
policeman now?

6
00:00:57,822 --> 00:00:59,255
Oh, God.

7
00:01:08,199 --> 00:01:09,632
Who's there?

8
00:01:11,769 --> 00:01:13,202
Who's there?

9
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,201
It's me.

10
00:01:19,677 --> 00:01:21,304
It's okay.

11
00:01:21,712 --> 00:01:23,543
It's okay. It's just me.

12
00:01:32,823 --> 00:01:33,983
Fuck.

13
00:01:40,631 --> 00:01:41,996
You're a mess.

14
00:01:43,734 --> 00:01:45,099
You get used to it.

15
00:01:48,906 --> 00:01:51,431
- They found Rabbit yet?
- Not yet.

16
00:01:51,642 --> 00:01:53,633
- If he's not dead...
- I know.

17
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,841
What you did for Max...

18
00:01:58,048 --> 00:01:59,106
I did it for you.

19
00:02:00,251 --> 00:02:01,275
I know.

20
00:02:05,623 --> 00:02:06,885
Gordon?

21
00:02:07,091 --> 00:02:08,820
Yeah, he won't let me see them.

22
00:02:14,064 --> 00:02:15,691
We can get through this.

23
00:02:18,202 --> 00:02:19,931
I need to get my family back.

24
00:02:20,638 --> 00:02:24,768
Ana will always
be a part of who I am.

25
00:02:24,975 --> 00:02:27,773
But I stopped living
for her a long time ago.

26
00:02:27,978 --> 00:02:29,673
Carrie Hopewell.

27
00:02:30,614 --> 00:02:32,343
You really think
that's who you are?

28
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,347
I honestly don't know anymore.

29
00:02:36,654 --> 00:02:38,019
But they're my children.

30
00:02:44,995 --> 00:02:46,257
That hearing is coming up...

31
00:02:46,464 --> 00:02:49,126
and God only knows where
all this is gonna land.

32
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:50,994
They know who I am now,

33
00:02:51,135 --> 00:02:53,501
but you can't afford
to have your cover blown.

34
00:02:55,906 --> 00:02:57,771
I think it's time
for you to disappear.

35
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,008
I disappeared for 15 years.

36
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,098
When you weren't in the house this
morning, I got worried.

37
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,360
I'm sorry.

38
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:03,470
You know, it would be so easy...

39
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:06,735
to just walk down there
and apologize.

40
00:04:07,611 --> 00:04:09,291
And as long as I said
all the right things,

41
00:04:09,313 --> 00:04:11,144
I could be back
in my bed tonight.

42
00:04:11,682 --> 00:04:14,276
I thought you had made peace
with your decision to leave.

43
00:04:15,853 --> 00:04:18,321
I killed that man, the mayor.

44
00:04:18,455 --> 00:04:19,735
You didn't know he was in there,

45
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,187
and neither did I.

46
00:04:21,392 --> 00:04:23,155
You really didn't know
he was in there?

47
00:04:23,561 --> 00:04:24,789
I never lied to you, Rebecca,

48
00:04:24,995 --> 00:04:26,553
and I'm not gonna start now.

49
00:04:27,965 --> 00:04:29,296
You choose my world,

50
00:04:29,466 --> 00:04:30,933
you have to know there
will be casualties.

51
00:04:31,101 --> 00:04:32,762
If you can't deal
with that then...

52
00:04:33,003 --> 00:04:35,267
maybe you do belong
back on the farm.

53
00:04:50,721 --> 00:04:51,779
Okay.

54
00:04:53,324 --> 00:04:54,621
Okay what?

55
00:05:04,535 --> 00:05:07,265
Okay, let's go home.

56
00:05:41,772 --> 00:05:44,798
Do you have any other speed
besides slow as shit?

57
00:05:45,042 --> 00:05:47,738
Hey, I'm recovering
from a gunshot wound.

58
00:05:47,978 --> 00:05:50,947
That's right, you got shot
because you slow as shit.

59
00:05:51,248 --> 00:05:53,910
How many times can you
bury the same guy?

60
00:05:54,184 --> 00:05:55,864
We wouldn't be out here
if your lazy ass...

61
00:05:56,053 --> 00:05:57,987
had dug a deep enough
hole the first time.

62
00:05:58,155 --> 00:05:59,884
Shut up and grab his feet.

63
00:06:01,558 --> 00:06:03,617
Fucker doesn't even have feet.

64
00:08:03,981 --> 00:08:06,506
Agent Racine?
Dean Xavier.

65
00:08:06,717 --> 00:08:08,412
You made good time.

66
00:08:08,619 --> 00:08:10,143
Not good enough.

67
00:08:11,755 --> 00:08:13,814
What do you have for me here?

68
00:08:14,024 --> 00:08:16,356
We got a couple of bodies that
don't add up.

69
00:08:19,096 --> 00:08:21,724
We've got positive IDs
on these two.

70
00:08:21,932 --> 00:08:24,492
Charles Randall
and Delmont Munson.

71
00:08:25,102 --> 00:08:26,899
Should that mean
something to me?

72
00:08:27,104 --> 00:08:29,095
No. They're local.

73
00:08:29,606 --> 00:08:31,206
But there was a third
body that we found.

74
00:08:31,308 --> 00:08:33,469
Teeth missing, fingers filed.

75
00:08:33,677 --> 00:08:35,338
But two days
after we dug him up,

76
00:08:35,546 --> 00:08:38,071
someone broke in here
and stole the body.

77
00:08:38,282 --> 00:08:40,307
Sorry, you can't smoke in here.

78
00:08:44,021 --> 00:08:46,148
Turns out we were able
to get some DNA samples

79
00:08:46,356 --> 00:08:47,916
from the clothing
that he was buried in.

80
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,323
I've already sent the kit out.

81
00:08:49,526 --> 00:08:52,154
You're showing this to me why?

82
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:56,761
Well, just thought
it might be pertinent.

83
00:08:59,536 --> 00:09:01,902
These bodies date back, what,

84
00:09:02,773 --> 00:09:04,468
about three or four months?

85
00:09:05,175 --> 00:09:07,939
Coroner's got them
at 16, 17 weeks.

86
00:09:08,345 --> 00:09:11,371
So long before Rabbit
showed up here...

87
00:09:11,548 --> 00:09:13,277
and everyone started shooting.

88
00:09:14,318 --> 00:09:16,718
Well, yes, but there's
other things going on here.

89
00:09:16,954 --> 00:09:18,854
These two guys worked
for Kai Proctor.

90
00:09:19,022 --> 00:09:20,421
I'm sorry, I forgot your name.

91
00:09:20,691 --> 00:09:22,522
Xavier.
Dean Xavier.

92
00:09:22,726 --> 00:09:23,818
Agent Xavier,

93
00:09:23,961 --> 00:09:25,961
I didn't come out here
to clean up all your messes.

94
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:27,656
Just the one.

95
00:09:46,483 --> 00:09:48,246
Deputy Emmett Yawners.

96
00:09:48,452 --> 00:09:50,613
Deputy Brock Lotus.

97
00:09:51,421 --> 00:09:53,651
Deputy Siobhan Kelly.

98
00:10:00,597 --> 00:10:02,155
Lucas Hood.

99
00:10:12,643 --> 00:10:14,907
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm Special Agent Jim Racine.

100
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:16,375
You all know Agent Xavier.

101
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,172
Let me tell you how
this is gonna work.

102
00:10:18,382 --> 00:10:20,646
This is a closed federal hearing

103
00:10:20,851 --> 00:10:23,820
in which you will be delivering
sworn testimony,

104
00:10:24,021 --> 00:10:25,886
'cause everyone knows
swearing on a Bible...

105
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:28,057
keeps people honest.

106
00:10:28,258 --> 00:10:30,158
You do have a right
to have an attorney present.

107
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,658
And I should inform you
that if you exercise that right,

108
00:10:32,863 --> 00:10:35,559
you will earn my immediate
and eternal suspicion.

109
00:10:36,767 --> 00:10:39,429
I'll call you in one by one
to answer questions.

110
00:10:39,603 --> 00:10:41,366
If you answer
to my satisfaction,

111
00:10:41,638 --> 00:10:44,334
this will probably be the last time
we see each other.

112
00:10:44,675 --> 00:10:47,508
I understand your mayor
recently suffered...

113
00:10:47,711 --> 00:10:50,339
the misfortune
of being blown up.

114
00:10:52,049 --> 00:10:54,847
This town is something else.

115
00:10:55,052 --> 00:10:56,212
I've asked Mr. Hopewell...

116
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:59,014
to serve as a witness
to these proceedings.

117
00:10:59,222 --> 00:11:01,190
As he's married
to Mrs. Hopewell,

118
00:11:01,391 --> 00:11:03,757
he's not exactly
an objective party here.

119
00:11:03,961 --> 00:11:07,419
But since he will play no part in the
resolution of these findings

120
00:11:07,631 --> 00:11:09,064
and since everyone in this town,

121
00:11:09,266 --> 00:11:12,235
seems to be connected
in some way to everyone else,

122
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,797
I'm gonna let that slide.

123
00:11:16,073 --> 00:11:17,404
Any questions?

124
00:11:21,445 --> 00:11:23,913
No? Okay.

125
00:11:25,549 --> 00:11:27,278
Come on, let's get started.

126
00:12:06,289 --> 00:12:08,621
State your name for the record.

127
00:12:08,925 --> 00:12:10,290
Lucas Hood.

128
00:12:10,994 --> 00:12:12,723
You're the sheriff?

129
00:12:12,929 --> 00:12:14,260
I am.

130
00:12:14,464 --> 00:12:16,694
Okay, then, Sheriff Hood,

131
00:12:16,933 --> 00:12:19,197
why don't you tell me
when you first came in contact

132
00:12:19,436 --> 00:12:20,733
with Mr. Rabbit.

133
00:12:20,904 --> 00:12:23,134
Well, Some of his men
shot up the Cadi.

134
00:12:27,244 --> 00:12:29,075
And you didn't kill
the men who shot at you?

135
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,940
- Nope.
- So who did?

136
00:12:37,454 --> 00:12:38,454
No idea.

137
00:12:40,223 --> 00:12:41,884
And Rabbit was there?

138
00:12:42,092 --> 00:12:43,753
What do you want, Rabbit?

139
00:12:44,094 --> 00:12:46,426
To be the last face
you ever saw.

140
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,927
Yes.

141
00:12:48,131 --> 00:12:49,564
Although, at that point,

142
00:12:49,766 --> 00:12:51,233
I didn't know who he was.

143
00:12:51,435 --> 00:12:53,494
So just to be clear,

144
00:12:53,703 --> 00:12:56,570
at no point in your life
before the events of that month

145
00:12:56,773 --> 00:13:00,732
had you met or spoken to
or had any kinds of dealings...

146
00:13:00,944 --> 00:13:02,309
with the gangster
known as Rabbit?

147
00:13:02,512 --> 00:13:03,945
Correct.

148
00:13:04,147 --> 00:13:05,944
But he spent
about 1,000 bullets,

149
00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:08,413
lost three men
trying to kill you.

150
00:13:08,618 --> 00:13:10,882
- Any idea why?
- No idea.

151
00:13:11,088 --> 00:13:13,283
You sticking with that story?

152
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,490
Yes.

153
00:13:14,691 --> 00:13:17,319
Mrs. Hopewell,
how would you characterize...

154
00:13:17,494 --> 00:13:19,325
your relationship
with the sheriff?

155
00:13:19,696 --> 00:13:21,960
I don't know.
Cordial, I guess.

156
00:13:22,566 --> 00:13:26,127
So not to put too fine
a point on it,

157
00:13:26,536 --> 00:13:28,003
were you fucking him?

158
00:13:28,238 --> 00:13:30,502
- Excuse me?
- Excuse my language.

159
00:13:30,707 --> 00:13:34,302
Were you involved in a sexual
relationship with the sheriff?

160
00:13:35,712 --> 00:13:36,712
Of course not.

161
00:13:38,381 --> 00:13:40,246
It's been my experience
that when a man...

162
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,970
puts himself through
that kind of hell,

163
00:13:41,985 --> 00:13:44,180
it's a pretty safe bet
that there's some sex...

164
00:13:44,387 --> 00:13:45,684
somewhere in the equation.

165
00:13:45,889 --> 00:13:49,916
So, just to clarify...

166
00:13:51,194 --> 00:13:52,354
you weren't fucking him?

167
00:13:55,832 --> 00:13:56,856
No.

168
00:13:57,067 --> 00:13:59,831
She told me that
her father was a gangster,

169
00:14:00,003 --> 00:14:02,563
that she had been hiding
from him for years,

170
00:14:03,206 --> 00:14:05,037
and that now he'd found her.

171
00:14:05,242 --> 00:14:06,642
In addition to asking
for your help,

172
00:14:06,743 --> 00:14:09,371
- she asked you to keep it a secret?
- Yes.

173
00:14:09,546 --> 00:14:10,945
Even from her husband?

174
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,480
- Yes.
- Which you did.

175
00:14:17,053 --> 00:14:18,315
Yes.

176
00:14:18,522 --> 00:14:19,750
Back in the day,

177
00:14:19,956 --> 00:14:22,823
before you went AWOL,

178
00:14:23,026 --> 00:14:25,722
there was a prevailing opinion
on the organized crime desk that...

179
00:14:27,264 --> 00:14:30,233
you were an integral part
of the organization.

180
00:14:32,836 --> 00:14:34,201
Is there a question in there?

181
00:14:34,738 --> 00:14:36,103
No.

182
00:14:39,609 --> 00:14:41,133
No question at all.

183
00:14:41,344 --> 00:14:43,244
By your own account, he had you
down there for a few hours.

184
00:14:43,446 --> 00:14:44,674
He must have said something.

185
00:14:44,881 --> 00:14:46,746
He said a lot of things.

186
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,190
Sheriff Hood?

187
00:14:58,528 --> 00:14:59,927
Sheriff Hood?

188
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,654
- Excuse me?
- I asked you

189
00:15:01,865 --> 00:15:04,026
what some of those things were.

190
00:15:06,102 --> 00:15:08,696
What did Rabbit talk about?

191
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,105
You took my only daughter
from me.

192
00:15:14,811 --> 00:15:17,780
There are no words
to express the pain.

193
00:15:23,553 --> 00:15:25,145
Sorry, I'm...

194
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,417
I'm not 100% yet.

195
00:15:31,595 --> 00:15:33,222
He spoke mainly in Russian.

196
00:15:33,697 --> 00:15:35,255
Ukrainian.

197
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,532
Yeah, well,
it's all Greek to me.

198
00:15:39,369 --> 00:15:41,030
Moving on.

199
00:15:41,238 --> 00:15:44,435
This business
with the metalworks.

200
00:15:44,975 --> 00:15:46,499
What the hell was that about?

201
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,541
We knew they had Sheriff Hood.

202
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,400
And that he'd be killed
very quickly if we didn't act.

203
00:15:52,449 --> 00:15:55,316
- I see. And who told you that?
- Mrs. Hopewell.

204
00:15:56,686 --> 00:15:58,085
You just took her word for it?

205
00:15:58,288 --> 00:15:59,585
She was very convincing.

206
00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:04,259
She told us she had
a past with Rabbit...

207
00:16:04,327 --> 00:16:05,692
which explained why he had
taken her son earlier...

208
00:16:05,895 --> 00:16:08,193
and that Sheriff Hood had
traded himself for the boy.

209
00:16:08,632 --> 00:16:11,123
You often go into battles
with civilians for backup?

210
00:16:11,334 --> 00:16:13,859
There were mitigating factors.
We had to move immediately.

211
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,838
I don't know.
13, 14 guys.

212
00:16:20,043 --> 00:16:21,442
I lost count.

213
00:16:21,645 --> 00:16:23,306
They were all
using machine guns.

214
00:16:23,513 --> 00:16:24,980
I couldn't hear myself think.

215
00:16:26,316 --> 00:16:27,340
I'm out!

216
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,074
First two caught me in my vest.

217
00:16:30,654 --> 00:16:32,053
Then I took one in the leg.

218
00:16:33,523 --> 00:16:36,151
We had no idea they'd be
that heavily armed.

219
00:16:38,595 --> 00:16:39,960
There was a guy up on
the stacks...

220
00:16:40,163 --> 00:16:41,960
laying down cover
fire with a machine gun.

221
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,966
- Who took him out?
- Mrs. Hopewell.

222
00:16:48,972 --> 00:16:50,234
Mrs. Hopewell.

223
00:16:52,008 --> 00:16:53,134
Mrs. Hopewell.

224
00:16:55,545 --> 00:16:58,105
Two shots...
one to the chest,

225
00:16:58,315 --> 00:16:59,748
one somewhere around the neck.

226
00:16:59,949 --> 00:17:01,712
That must have been hard...

227
00:17:01,918 --> 00:17:04,011
for you to shoot
your own father.

228
00:17:04,688 --> 00:17:06,553
Good-bye, Daddy.

229
00:17:08,758 --> 00:17:11,124
Well, he kidnapped my son
and threatened my family.

230
00:17:11,328 --> 00:17:14,627
My father was an evil
and twisted man.

231
00:17:14,831 --> 00:17:16,662
No, he wasn't.

232
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:23,430
He is an evil and twisted man.

233
00:17:24,007 --> 00:17:25,338
He's not dead.

234
00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:26,873
I shot him point-blank.

235
00:17:27,077 --> 00:17:28,597
Well, then I guess
it was his corpse...

236
00:17:28,745 --> 00:17:30,465
that got up and walked
out of that building.

237
00:17:30,547 --> 00:17:33,175
I saw him go down.
He couldn't have survived.

238
00:17:33,383 --> 00:17:34,983
- And even if...
- He's not dead!

239
00:17:34,984 --> 00:17:36,264
- And even if...
- He's not dead!

240
00:18:08,918 --> 00:18:10,545
Normally we review testimony...

241
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,688
over a period of weeks.

242
00:18:12,889 --> 00:18:15,915
But if I've learned anything
in my years of doing this,

243
00:18:16,126 --> 00:18:17,252
it's that bullshit

244
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,257
will stay bullshit
no matter how long.

245
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:23,060
I think we've had our fill today.

246
00:18:24,067 --> 00:18:26,058
And fortunately
after years of meetings,

247
00:18:26,269 --> 00:18:28,029
I have been granted
the serenity to accept...

248
00:18:28,138 --> 00:18:29,969
the things I cannot change.

249
00:18:33,243 --> 00:18:35,083
I think we can all agree
that you all showed...

250
00:18:35,278 --> 00:18:36,973
some monumentally bad judgment.

251
00:18:38,181 --> 00:18:39,648
At the same time,

252
00:18:41,117 --> 00:18:43,779
a group of hardened criminals was
setting up shop in your town.

253
00:18:43,987 --> 00:18:45,614
Desperate times and so on.

254
00:18:46,756 --> 00:18:48,314
The bottom line is...

255
00:18:49,793 --> 00:18:51,420
this town needs
its sheriff's department.

256
00:18:53,129 --> 00:18:54,528
Lucas Hood,

257
00:18:54,731 --> 00:18:57,131
you were not on active duty
on the night in question.

258
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,460
You had surrendered
your firearm and badge...

259
00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:01,261
and were for all
intents and purposes

260
00:19:01,471 --> 00:19:02,768
an endangered civilian.

261
00:19:03,606 --> 00:19:06,302
As far as I can tell, you weren't
doing any of the shooting.

262
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,501
As such, I've got
no book to throw at you.

263
00:19:12,248 --> 00:19:14,182
Congratulations,
you're the sheriff again.

264
00:19:18,087 --> 00:19:19,952
Deputy Lotus.

265
00:19:21,224 --> 00:19:23,818
You were in charge that night.

266
00:19:24,027 --> 00:19:27,292
As such, I'm gonna
throw you under the bus.

267
00:19:28,832 --> 00:19:31,164
But you also got shot trying to
rescue one of your own.

268
00:19:31,367 --> 00:19:32,732
That makes you
something of a hero.

269
00:19:34,304 --> 00:19:36,329
So 18 months probation,

270
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:38,234
and a letter of censure
in your jacket.

271
00:19:38,441 --> 00:19:40,241
Are you kidding me?
You cannot come in here...

272
00:19:40,243 --> 00:19:42,443
You want to take this up the ladder,
you go right ahead.

273
00:19:42,579 --> 00:19:44,979
The protocol breaches alone would be
grounds for a criminal hearing.

274
00:19:45,114 --> 00:19:46,234
I don't know how the hell...

275
00:19:46,249 --> 00:19:47,889
You won the fucking
lottery with me today!

276
00:19:48,551 --> 00:19:51,213
And this is where a smart man
would shut the hell up.

277
00:19:52,589 --> 00:19:55,285
Deputies Yawners and Kelly,
12 months probation.

278
00:19:55,492 --> 00:19:57,323
Either of you does anything
that even raises an eyebrow...

279
00:19:57,527 --> 00:19:59,154
in my office
and you're unemployed.

280
00:20:01,064 --> 00:20:03,089
And the BSD will be
under federal oversight...

281
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:04,493
for the next two years.

282
00:20:04,701 --> 00:20:07,135
Every arrest, every call,
every traffic ticket...

283
00:20:07,337 --> 00:20:08,702
will be subject to my review.

284
00:20:08,905 --> 00:20:11,169
So you had better make sure
you do it all by the book.

285
00:20:24,721 --> 00:20:26,712
I've got to go.
I'm late.

286
00:20:30,026 --> 00:20:31,994
How can you let them
all off like that?

287
00:20:32,195 --> 00:20:33,560
There were two other civilians.

288
00:20:33,763 --> 00:20:36,197
The bartender had priors.
You didn't even charge them.

289
00:20:36,399 --> 00:20:39,391
Local criminal elements
are the sheriff's problem, not mine.

290
00:20:39,602 --> 00:20:41,562
But why are they
any different than Mrs. Hopewell?

291
00:20:41,604 --> 00:20:44,971
Because they are not the daughters
of a Ukrainian crime lord.

292
00:20:45,642 --> 00:20:48,736
The US Attorney's office
authorized you

293
00:20:48,945 --> 00:20:51,607
- to conduct a full-scale hearing...
- Oh, for fuck's sake.

294
00:20:51,814 --> 00:20:53,645
Xavier, I've got
bigger fish to fry.

295
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,340
Your fish is dead.

296
00:20:55,552 --> 00:20:57,349
You're so obsessed with finding this
Rabbit that you're losing sight...

297
00:20:57,554 --> 00:21:00,523
He's not dead! You'd have another
body to show me.

298
00:21:00,723 --> 00:21:02,803
Rabbit's got a fucking river
of blood on his hands...

299
00:21:02,825 --> 00:21:05,191
and you want to waste my time
on small-town shenanigans?

300
00:21:05,395 --> 00:21:07,192
How are you gonna explain what you
did in there to Washington?

301
00:21:07,397 --> 00:21:08,887
- It won't hold up.
- It's Banshee, Pennsylvania.

302
00:21:09,098 --> 00:21:10,656
No one gives a shit!

303
00:21:11,968 --> 00:21:13,560
Let go of me.

304
00:21:22,278 --> 00:21:24,109
Look, I'll be dead
pretty soon, Xavier.

305
00:21:26,482 --> 00:21:28,541
My cancer has got cancer.

306
00:21:31,287 --> 00:21:33,653
But I am going to spend some
small amount of time...

307
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,414
on this planet,

308
00:21:36,025 --> 00:21:38,391
knowing that bastard
isn't on it.

309
00:21:42,198 --> 00:21:44,826
And whatever his unresolved
issues are here,

310
00:21:45,034 --> 00:21:47,002
I want them all...

311
00:21:47,203 --> 00:21:48,932
right where they are
so he can find them...

312
00:21:49,138 --> 00:21:50,765
when he's ready.

313
00:21:52,308 --> 00:21:54,071
You're using them as bait?

314
00:21:54,444 --> 00:21:56,275
That's what you do
with little fish.

315
00:21:58,081 --> 00:21:59,139
This is my case.

316
00:21:59,415 --> 00:22:00,541
No,

317
00:22:01,184 --> 00:22:03,277
your case was Proctor,

318
00:22:03,486 --> 00:22:05,545
who has somehow...

319
00:22:06,422 --> 00:22:08,322
managed to be the only guy
in this town not involved...

320
00:22:08,491 --> 00:22:09,753
in this shit show.

321
00:22:12,328 --> 00:22:14,523
Seems to me, Agent Xavier,

322
00:22:14,731 --> 00:22:16,790
your mishandling of things here...

323
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,025
has led to a lot of dead bodies,

324
00:22:19,235 --> 00:22:22,727
and a pretty serious amount of
reckless endangerment.

325
00:22:24,073 --> 00:22:26,735
What the hell
are you talking about?

326
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:29,010
You can go down for this,

327
00:22:29,746 --> 00:22:31,771
or you can take a reassignment.

328
00:22:33,483 --> 00:22:35,508
Oh, shit, I'm late.

329
00:22:38,488 --> 00:22:40,422
Pack your bags.

330
00:22:41,858 --> 00:22:44,292
You'll have new marching orders
by tonight.

331
00:22:47,997 --> 00:22:49,328
Mrs. Hopewell.

332
00:22:50,667 --> 00:22:54,364
As a civilian, you don't fall under
the same federal statutes

333
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:57,437
as the sworn members
of law enforcement,

334
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,609
so I'm turning your case
over to the DA's office.

335
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:03,404
You'll be charged with unlawful
possession of a firearm...

336
00:23:03,579 --> 00:23:06,139
and obstruction of justice,

337
00:23:06,349 --> 00:23:09,079
whatever other charges
they can drum up...

338
00:23:09,285 --> 00:23:12,049
in regard to your involvement
on the night in question.

339
00:23:12,255 --> 00:23:14,086
They took my son.

340
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:16,315
That is...

341
00:23:16,526 --> 00:23:18,357
unless you can shed some light...

342
00:23:18,561 --> 00:23:22,258
on where Daddy
might be holed up.

343
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,531
If you were to aid in my
investigation,

344
00:23:25,768 --> 00:23:27,292
I might find a way

345
00:23:27,503 --> 00:23:29,471
to make those charges disappear.

346
00:23:29,672 --> 00:23:32,334
If I knew where he was,
don't you think I would tell you?

347
00:23:32,542 --> 00:23:35,170
After everything
I heard in there,

348
00:23:35,378 --> 00:23:37,073
I have no idea...

349
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,975
what you would or wouldn't do.

350
00:23:39,182 --> 00:23:40,410
You're a bastard.

351
00:23:43,486 --> 00:23:45,181
I'd lawyer up, then.

352
00:23:47,857 --> 00:23:49,188
Good luck in court.

353
00:23:53,696 --> 00:23:55,061
Gordon.

354
00:23:56,466 --> 00:23:58,058
How's the leg?

355
00:23:58,267 --> 00:24:00,098
It's getting there.

356
00:24:02,939 --> 00:24:04,167
You believe this shit?

357
00:24:04,373 --> 00:24:05,863
What, after everything else,

358
00:24:06,075 --> 00:24:08,100
this is the part you find
hard to believe?

359
00:24:08,311 --> 00:24:10,336
Hey, Gordon, I'm sorry.

360
00:24:10,546 --> 00:24:12,980
I know your family's
been through a lot.

361
00:24:14,417 --> 00:24:15,937
Listen, if there's
anything I can do...

362
00:24:15,985 --> 00:24:17,475
Well, maybe there is.

363
00:24:22,391 --> 00:24:24,416
I want you to keep
an eye on Hood for me.

364
00:24:24,627 --> 00:24:25,924
Anything out of the ordinary,

365
00:24:26,129 --> 00:24:27,569
I want to be the first
call you make.

366
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:31,222
- That's pretty much everything.
- Well, that's my point.

367
00:24:31,768 --> 00:24:33,326
Now you got a place to come to.

368
00:25:55,017 --> 00:25:56,917
You gonna put that badge
back on or what?

369
00:25:58,154 --> 00:25:59,781
I didn't want to rub it in.

370
00:25:59,989 --> 00:26:02,219
After what we went through
to bring you back...

371
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:04,856
damn well better wear it.

372
00:26:07,096 --> 00:26:09,257
- Hey.
- Yeah?

373
00:26:09,832 --> 00:26:11,163
Thank you.

374
00:26:12,101 --> 00:26:13,898
Yeah, well,

375
00:26:14,103 --> 00:26:17,368
let's see how long you can stay out
of trouble this time?

376
00:26:20,243 --> 00:26:22,803
We dodge a federal probe
by the skin of our teeth...

377
00:26:23,012 --> 00:26:25,879
and the first thing we do is go out
and rob an armored truck?

378
00:26:26,082 --> 00:26:28,175
Quit your whining
and pop those doors.

379
00:26:29,752 --> 00:26:32,084
Whoo!
Flip that bitch!

380
00:26:40,897 --> 00:26:43,889
...floating high to deep
center field!

381
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,897
Come on, baby.

382
00:26:52,909 --> 00:26:54,399
Okay, let's go.

383
00:27:01,117 --> 00:27:03,984
- Time.
- Okay, I'll be right behind you.

384
00:27:06,389 --> 00:27:08,550
- What the hell is going on?
- We're being jacked.

385
00:27:21,737 --> 00:27:23,068
Grab him.

386
00:27:25,374 --> 00:27:27,103
Oh, fuck me.

387
00:27:32,048 --> 00:27:33,345
Motherfucker!

388
00:27:41,657 --> 00:27:43,022
You hit 'em?

389
00:27:51,767 --> 00:27:53,064
Ana, stay with them.

390
00:27:53,269 --> 00:27:55,100
What? Oh, don't even
think about it, baby.

391
00:27:55,304 --> 00:27:57,204
No, we don't have
fucking time. Fuck!

392
00:27:58,374 --> 00:27:59,534
What is he doing?

393
00:27:59,742 --> 00:28:01,232
God damn it!

394
00:28:02,878 --> 00:28:05,847
Get back in here.
We're coming up on the split.

395
00:28:06,048 --> 00:28:08,482
I'm turning in three,

396
00:28:08,684 --> 00:28:10,447
two, one.

397
00:28:26,669 --> 00:28:28,136
Hi.

398
00:28:28,337 --> 00:28:29,804
Hi.

399
00:28:32,942 --> 00:28:35,740
Dude, I'm pretty sure
this is the ugliest color.

400
00:28:35,945 --> 00:28:38,209
- You like these? No?
- You can do better.

401
00:28:38,414 --> 00:28:40,405
I think these
would be hot, though.

402
00:28:40,616 --> 00:28:42,846
- Oh, my God, they match your hair.
- They're perfect.

403
00:28:43,052 --> 00:28:44,849
Uh, no, no.
You're crazy.

404
00:28:45,054 --> 00:28:46,214
All the boys would love that.

405
00:28:46,288 --> 00:28:47,768
My grandma would
seriously wear these.

406
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:50,615
Oh, I actually like these.

407
00:28:50,826 --> 00:28:52,885
- Kind of cool.
- Those are hot.

408
00:28:53,095 --> 00:28:54,892
- Yeah, I like these.
- You should get them.

409
00:28:55,097 --> 00:28:58,191
I don't know. I don't think
I need them, right?

410
00:28:59,735 --> 00:29:00,827
Yeah.

411
00:29:02,138 --> 00:29:03,571
All right, I think we're good.

412
00:29:03,773 --> 00:29:05,263
Yeah.

413
00:29:06,442 --> 00:29:08,467
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

414
00:29:12,381 --> 00:29:14,872
Excuse me, girls.

415
00:29:15,084 --> 00:29:16,483
- Come here.
- What? What?

416
00:29:16,685 --> 00:29:18,685
- Can I see what's in your bag?
- What do you want?

417
00:29:28,964 --> 00:29:30,261
Fuck my shit.

418
00:29:30,466 --> 00:29:32,525
- Get down!
- Shit!

419
00:29:39,909 --> 00:29:41,536
Who the fuck is that?

420
00:29:41,744 --> 00:29:43,041
How the hell should I know?

421
00:29:44,046 --> 00:29:46,173
- Well, will you shoot him already?
- Oh!

422
00:29:52,321 --> 00:29:54,118
Drive! Drive!

423
00:30:12,975 --> 00:30:15,569
Fuck.
Oh, shit.

424
00:30:19,915 --> 00:30:21,473
- Let's go.
- God damn it!

425
00:30:21,684 --> 00:30:23,151
That motherfucker can shoot.

426
00:30:33,028 --> 00:30:34,620
Okay, let's go.
Go, go, go!

427
00:30:38,734 --> 00:30:40,964
Let's go, let's go!

428
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:42,603
Go! Go, go!

429
00:30:54,083 --> 00:30:55,083
Shit!

430
00:30:55,184 --> 00:30:56,624
I love it when a plan
comes together.

431
00:30:57,853 --> 00:30:59,013
Shut the fuck up and drive.

432
00:31:10,633 --> 00:31:12,999
So you want the good news
or the bad news first?

433
00:31:14,537 --> 00:31:16,232
What happened?
Who the hell was that?

434
00:31:16,438 --> 00:31:17,803
I don't know.

435
00:31:18,007 --> 00:31:19,567
I thought you said you had this
handled?

436
00:31:19,642 --> 00:31:20,642
It was.

437
00:31:20,843 --> 00:31:23,004
Maybe we should review
your definition of handled.

438
00:31:23,212 --> 00:31:24,804
The guards weren't tipped off

439
00:31:25,014 --> 00:31:27,039
or Job never would have made it past
dispatch this morning.

440
00:31:27,249 --> 00:31:28,477
I don't know who that was,

441
00:31:28,684 --> 00:31:31,244
but it wasn't Kinaho security
and it wasn't the cops.

442
00:31:32,321 --> 00:31:34,789
We got well over 100 grand here.

443
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:37,083
It's not what we were going for,
but it's something.

444
00:31:37,293 --> 00:31:39,013
All that planning, man,
and we got rolled...

445
00:31:39,094 --> 00:31:40,614
like a bunch of
motherfucking amateurs.

446
00:31:40,796 --> 00:31:41,796
Yeah, how?

447
00:31:41,964 --> 00:31:43,329
Only the four of us knew.

448
00:31:44,166 --> 00:31:46,361
Well, no one here
leaked anything, right?

449
00:31:46,569 --> 00:31:48,537
Could you have been hacked?

450
00:31:48,737 --> 00:31:50,329
First of all, fuck you.

451
00:31:50,539 --> 00:31:52,336
Second of all,
I ain't the one shaking off...

452
00:31:52,541 --> 00:31:54,065
fifteen years of mommy rust.

453
00:31:54,276 --> 00:31:55,436
Okay, I'm out of here.

454
00:31:55,644 --> 00:31:57,202
Call me when you've got
my cut ready.

455
00:31:57,947 --> 00:32:00,245
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
- What?

456
00:32:00,449 --> 00:32:01,677
What are you so pissed about?

457
00:32:01,884 --> 00:32:04,044
I should have my head
examined for doing this with you.

458
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:06,178
Hey, you came to me.
Don't forget that.

459
00:32:07,056 --> 00:32:08,353
We had this planned without you.

460
00:32:08,557 --> 00:32:09,524
And who would have
done the driving?

461
00:32:09,725 --> 00:32:11,317
- Come on, Ana.
- That's not my name.

462
00:32:11,527 --> 00:32:13,119
- It's who you are.
- No, that's who you want me to be.

463
00:32:13,329 --> 00:32:14,929
If that's true,
then why did you want in?

464
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,191
I got fired, okay?

465
00:32:20,402 --> 00:32:21,801
By my best friend.

466
00:32:22,004 --> 00:32:23,631
And no one else
is going to hire me,

467
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:25,839
especially if I get brought up
on criminal charges,

468
00:32:25,908 --> 00:32:28,069
which seems to be
what Racine is aiming for.

469
00:32:31,447 --> 00:32:32,641
I'm broke.

470
00:32:33,482 --> 00:32:35,712
So this is pretty much
the only gig I've got.

471
00:32:42,725 --> 00:32:44,886
I think now might be a good time
to remind you...

472
00:32:45,094 --> 00:32:46,755
we need to get the fuck
out of this town.

473
00:32:46,996 --> 00:32:48,190
Not yet.

474
00:32:48,364 --> 00:32:49,422
Come on, man.

475
00:32:49,732 --> 00:32:52,030
We came, we saw,
we got our asses whipped.

476
00:32:52,234 --> 00:32:53,514
And if Rabbit is still out
there,

477
00:32:53,535 --> 00:32:55,696
that's just one more
reason to get gone.

478
00:32:55,904 --> 00:32:58,372
We risking our necks
out here for chump change.

479
00:32:58,574 --> 00:32:59,802
We're still good.

480
00:33:00,643 --> 00:33:02,907
Still got those diamonds, right?

481
00:33:04,246 --> 00:33:05,406
Fuck me.

482
00:33:08,617 --> 00:33:11,745
Look, every day,
you find a new way...

483
00:33:11,954 --> 00:33:14,582
to get your damn head blown
off and mine along with it.

484
00:33:15,324 --> 00:33:18,487
Those diamonds are an insurance
policy for the both of us.

485
00:33:18,694 --> 00:33:20,355
- I was keeping them safe.
- I know.

486
00:33:23,132 --> 00:33:24,656
I would never cut you out.

487
00:33:26,402 --> 00:33:27,767
I know.

488
00:33:32,274 --> 00:33:33,935
So let's get
the fuck out of here.

489
00:33:34,143 --> 00:33:36,263
We can fence the stones
and set up shop in New York...

490
00:33:36,345 --> 00:33:37,437
or anywhere else you want.

491
00:33:37,613 --> 00:33:39,740
Not yet.

492
00:33:41,917 --> 00:33:44,681
For fuck's sake, what the hell is
keeping you here, man?

493
00:33:47,956 --> 00:33:49,150
Here's how this works.

494
00:33:49,358 --> 00:33:50,222
You either give me your names...

495
00:33:50,426 --> 00:33:51,666
so that I can call your parents

496
00:33:51,794 --> 00:33:53,284
or I have to involve the police.

497
00:33:53,495 --> 00:33:54,935
And I'm telling
you it was a mistake.

498
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:56,130
I meant to pay for them.

499
00:33:56,332 --> 00:33:58,197
And I'm sure your parents
will believe you.

500
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,836
I'm trying to cut you a break here
by not calling the police.

501
00:34:02,304 --> 00:34:04,101
- Call them.
- Okay.

502
00:34:04,306 --> 00:34:05,534
And as soon as they get here,

503
00:34:05,708 --> 00:34:07,471
I'll tell them how
you groped me...

504
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:09,030
when you
were taking us back here.

505
00:34:09,078 --> 00:34:10,443
Don't be ridiculous.

506
00:34:10,646 --> 00:34:12,671
He said he had to search me.

507
00:34:14,383 --> 00:34:16,943
And then he started, like,

508
00:34:17,586 --> 00:34:19,918
rubbing my breasts.

509
00:34:20,122 --> 00:34:22,784
- I was so scared.
- Deva.

510
00:34:22,991 --> 00:34:25,016
And you'll tell them
it never happened.

511
00:34:25,227 --> 00:34:26,421
And I am sure...

512
00:34:26,562 --> 00:34:28,086
your wife will believe you.

513
00:34:28,297 --> 00:34:30,891
So, William...
can I call you William?

514
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,727
What's it gonna be?

515
00:34:36,271 --> 00:34:38,637
Keep up the good work, William.
Come on, Beats.

516
00:34:41,777 --> 00:34:43,369
They knew what they were doing.

517
00:34:43,579 --> 00:34:44,910
Ever since they built
that new connector,

518
00:34:45,114 --> 00:34:46,877
barely anyone uses
that highway anymore.

519
00:34:47,082 --> 00:34:48,310
Least that much makes sense.

520
00:34:48,517 --> 00:34:50,951
So someone else
ran them off the road...

521
00:34:51,153 --> 00:34:52,916
and they left
all the cash behind?

522
00:34:53,122 --> 00:34:55,488
- Not all of it.
- Someone got away with one bag.

523
00:34:55,691 --> 00:34:57,283
100,000 and change.

524
00:34:57,493 --> 00:34:59,757
Either the thieves
or whoever ran them down.

525
00:34:59,962 --> 00:35:02,522
Yeah, but you
got off light considering.

526
00:35:04,466 --> 00:35:05,990
Any idea who the shooter was?

527
00:35:06,201 --> 00:35:07,668
Can't help you there.

528
00:35:09,037 --> 00:35:10,334
This fake guard,

529
00:35:11,106 --> 00:35:12,801
you catch any security video...

530
00:35:13,008 --> 00:35:14,488
of him loading
the truck this morning?

531
00:35:14,543 --> 00:35:16,135
The server went down
this morning.

532
00:35:16,345 --> 00:35:18,813
So did our backup.
Some kind of virus.

533
00:35:19,014 --> 00:35:21,608
We lost the last
24 hours of footage.

534
00:35:23,552 --> 00:35:25,816
And the missing cash,
any way to trace that?

535
00:35:26,021 --> 00:35:27,886
Serial numbers?
Markers?

536
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:29,751
It's unbanked cash
from the tables.

537
00:35:29,958 --> 00:35:31,482
Yesterday it was
in someone's pocket.

538
00:35:33,128 --> 00:35:35,824
Yeah, I figured as much.

539
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,663
There are some
on the reservation...

540
00:35:39,868 --> 00:35:42,462
who would consider
$150,000 quite a bit.

541
00:35:42,671 --> 00:35:44,229
A fortune, actually.

542
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,135
It is troubling,

543
00:35:46,341 --> 00:35:49,139
this coming so soon after the
setback with the hotel.

544
00:35:49,578 --> 00:35:51,637
Whether this was Proctor or not,

545
00:35:51,847 --> 00:35:53,940
the fact remains
that the Kinaho Moon...

546
00:35:54,149 --> 00:35:55,878
is having some serious problems.

547
00:35:56,084 --> 00:35:57,551
George, we've been through this.

548
00:35:57,753 --> 00:36:00,551
This entire renovation
and expansion...

549
00:36:00,756 --> 00:36:03,020
was designed to be serviced
by that hotel,

550
00:36:03,225 --> 00:36:04,590
which is now rubble.

551
00:36:04,793 --> 00:36:08,229
I take it your insurance didn't cover
unexplained explosions.

552
00:36:08,764 --> 00:36:11,198
You've been opposed to the hotel
project from the start.

553
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,526
My father...

554
00:36:12,734 --> 00:36:15,066
Your father was a great man...

555
00:36:15,237 --> 00:36:17,865
who lost his way
when he became ill.

556
00:36:18,941 --> 00:36:20,499
Even you have to concede...

557
00:36:20,709 --> 00:36:23,303
that since you've become chief,
our fortunes have suffered.

558
00:36:23,479 --> 00:36:25,674
And the tribe
simply can't afford it.

559
00:36:25,981 --> 00:36:27,949
The sooner you say
what you came to say,

560
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,344
the sooner you can leave.

561
00:36:29,551 --> 00:36:31,485
You're out of your depth, Alex.

562
00:36:31,687 --> 00:36:34,349
And the members of the tribal council
have serious concerns,

563
00:36:34,556 --> 00:36:35,818
about your qualifications.

564
00:36:36,959 --> 00:36:38,950
You've always wanted
this seat, George.

565
00:36:39,161 --> 00:36:40,753
Everybody knows that.

566
00:36:42,498 --> 00:36:45,831
And everybody knows
that you're too young for it.

567
00:36:52,708 --> 00:36:53,766
Nola.

568
00:36:58,547 --> 00:36:59,878
I know.

569
00:37:02,784 --> 00:37:04,411
And they use
special effects for it.

570
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,884
But you can tell because
his hair is barely moving.

571
00:37:07,089 --> 00:37:09,169
And if he was really flying,
his hair would be, like,

572
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:10,882
you know, flying around
his face and everything.

573
00:37:11,093 --> 00:37:12,958
Yeah, you are totally right.

574
00:37:15,931 --> 00:37:17,421
You okay?

575
00:37:17,633 --> 00:37:19,157
Hey, where's your inhaler?

576
00:37:19,368 --> 00:37:20,426
I got it.

577
00:37:24,573 --> 00:37:26,165
Here.
Here, bud.

578
00:37:27,442 --> 00:37:28,807
Deep breaths.

579
00:37:47,529 --> 00:37:49,554
- You shouldn't be here.
- This is my home.

580
00:37:49,765 --> 00:37:51,096
Look, your case...

581
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,165
is going to the grand jury.
I'm the district attorney.

582
00:37:53,368 --> 00:37:55,461
Are you really gonna
let them charge me?

583
00:37:56,638 --> 00:37:58,105
Racine wants a scapegoat.

584
00:37:58,307 --> 00:38:00,275
I have no choice
but to recuse myself.

585
00:38:00,475 --> 00:38:01,999
There's nothing I can do.

586
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:03,677
The assistant
district attorney...

587
00:38:03,879 --> 00:38:05,346
Bullshit.
She works for you.

588
00:38:05,547 --> 00:38:07,447
I'm sorry.
Are you innocent?

589
00:38:07,649 --> 00:38:09,048
Is that what you're telling me?

590
00:38:09,251 --> 00:38:10,650
I hurt you.
I know that.

591
00:38:10,852 --> 00:38:12,843
No, Carrie.
Not me, all of us.

592
00:38:13,055 --> 00:38:15,216
Max, Deva.
And you didn't hurt us.

593
00:38:15,424 --> 00:38:16,584
You destroyed our family.

594
00:38:16,792 --> 00:38:18,726
You scarred your kids.
And they will not heal.

595
00:38:18,927 --> 00:38:20,952
And sending their mother to prison,
that's going to help?

596
00:38:21,163 --> 00:38:23,154
Well, their mother
almost got them killed.

597
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:30,429
I'm drowning here, Gordon.

598
00:38:31,573 --> 00:38:33,438
Yeah, well, join
the fucking club.

599
00:38:37,546 --> 00:38:39,707
That's the last of it.

600
00:38:42,851 --> 00:38:44,341
Thanks.

601
00:38:46,188 --> 00:38:47,416
New beginnings.

602
00:38:49,524 --> 00:38:51,515
It's just temporary.

603
00:38:51,727 --> 00:38:53,126
I know.

604
00:38:54,363 --> 00:38:56,331
So, we're back in business.

605
00:38:59,534 --> 00:39:01,399
Kind of hard to believe
we got off so light?

606
00:39:02,004 --> 00:39:04,837
Yeah, Racine's not
interested in us.

607
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:07,338
It's Rabbit he wants.

608
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:09,870
You really think...

609
00:39:10,078 --> 00:39:12,103
Gordon's gonna let
Carrie go down for this?

610
00:39:14,316 --> 00:39:16,614
Racine's pulling
all the strings.

611
00:39:19,788 --> 00:39:22,086
He's just playing every angle.

612
00:39:22,991 --> 00:39:24,720
Trying to flush out Rabbit.

613
00:39:33,702 --> 00:39:34,930
Can I ask you something?

614
00:39:35,137 --> 00:39:36,695
- Off the record.
- Sure.

615
00:39:38,807 --> 00:39:40,206
You and Carrie Hopewell.

616
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:43,210
What?

617
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:46,103
I don't know.
You tell me.

618
00:39:47,883 --> 00:39:49,373
There's nothing to tell.

619
00:39:50,652 --> 00:39:52,643
I got in over my head.

620
00:39:52,854 --> 00:39:54,048
That's all.

621
00:39:55,424 --> 00:39:57,187
So there's nothing
between the two of you?

622
00:39:57,959 --> 00:39:58,959
No.

623
00:39:59,494 --> 00:40:02,361
I should probably go.
Let you get settled.

624
00:40:03,231 --> 00:40:04,789
You've got secrets, boss.

625
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,092
Don't we all?

626
00:40:06,301 --> 00:40:07,791
I'm just saying...

627
00:40:09,805 --> 00:40:12,045
if they ever get to be too much or if
you want to talk...

628
00:40:12,908 --> 00:40:14,000
All right.

629
00:40:16,812 --> 00:40:18,279
What you did,

630
00:40:19,314 --> 00:40:23,580
coming to check up on me every day
these past few weeks,

631
00:40:23,785 --> 00:40:25,514
that...

632
00:40:27,355 --> 00:40:29,220
that was a big help.

633
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,257
Good.

634
00:40:33,462 --> 00:40:35,930
I'm just glad
you're back on your feet.

635
00:40:48,376 --> 00:40:49,866
I'll see you tomorrow.

636
00:41:01,857 --> 00:41:04,155
It's hard to know what to say
at a time like this.

637
00:41:05,994 --> 00:41:08,462
You know, Banshee's a town
like any other town.

638
00:41:09,865 --> 00:41:12,663
And like any other town,
we have our darkness.

639
00:41:14,236 --> 00:41:15,999
Our secrets.

640
00:41:22,878 --> 00:41:24,869
Danny was too young
to be mayor...

641
00:41:25,514 --> 00:41:28,039
and he was definitely
too young to die.

642
00:41:29,284 --> 00:41:31,445
But something in him
compelled him to...

643
00:41:32,387 --> 00:41:34,252
fight for goodness and justice.

644
00:41:35,657 --> 00:41:36,885
He was young enough...

645
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:39,657
or maybe naive enough
to think that...

646
00:41:40,996 --> 00:41:43,965
that he could help to build us
something better than we had,

647
00:41:44,166 --> 00:41:45,565
something better than...

648
00:41:45,767 --> 00:41:47,291
maybe some of us deserved.

649
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,501
He hadn't seen enough
yet to know fear.

650
00:41:57,345 --> 00:41:58,539
Or regret.

651
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,020
Or the relentless
nature of evil.

652
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:16,722
And the truth is,

653
00:42:16,932 --> 00:42:19,093
we should have had
this service weeks ago,

654
00:42:19,301 --> 00:42:22,429
but Dan's the one who always
arranged these kind of events.

655
00:42:22,971 --> 00:42:25,531
We're all just playing
catch-up now,

656
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:28,038
trying to fill the void he left.

657
00:42:31,012 --> 00:42:33,503
Janie, on behalf of myself,

658
00:42:33,715 --> 00:42:35,444
my office, and all of Banshee,

659
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:37,174
we mourn his loss with you.

660
00:42:46,194 --> 00:42:49,789
So, back to business as usual?

661
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:57,201
Whatever that is.

662
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:00,365
You know, Job may have a point.

663
00:43:00,575 --> 00:43:04,602
Do you ever stop to wonder
if you be pushing your luck?

664
00:43:04,813 --> 00:43:08,305
Maybe it's time for you to take your
show on the road.

665
00:43:09,818 --> 00:43:14,016
Look here, even
at 20 cents on the dollar,

666
00:43:14,222 --> 00:43:16,918
those diamonds are more than enough
to get you set up...

667
00:43:17,125 --> 00:43:18,922
anywhere you choose.

668
00:43:19,127 --> 00:43:20,424
Trying to get rid of me?

669
00:43:20,629 --> 00:43:22,426
Yeah, maybe I am.

670
00:43:22,631 --> 00:43:24,064
For your own good.

671
00:43:25,533 --> 00:43:26,795
Come on, man.

672
00:43:27,002 --> 00:43:30,563
You've taken this sheriff thing about
as far as it should have gone.

673
00:43:30,772 --> 00:43:31,830
Sooner or later,

674
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,837
someone's gonna figure out
who you are.

675
00:43:34,042 --> 00:43:37,102
Or at least who you are not.

676
00:43:39,681 --> 00:43:41,546
The thing is...

677
00:43:44,152 --> 00:43:45,346
she's all I had.

678
00:43:47,923 --> 00:43:49,185
I leave here...

679
00:43:51,826 --> 00:43:54,522
I don't know, I feel
like I'll disappear or something.

680
00:43:54,729 --> 00:43:56,492
You start over.

681
00:43:56,698 --> 00:43:59,030
It's what you do
after a stretch like yours.

682
00:43:59,234 --> 00:44:00,895
- Not that simple.
- Maybe.

683
00:44:01,102 --> 00:44:04,799
Maybe you just don't know
simple when you see it.

684
00:44:07,876 --> 00:44:09,400
Seat taken?

685
00:44:10,512 --> 00:44:12,343
No, it's all yours.

686
00:44:12,547 --> 00:44:14,276
Haven't seen you before.

687
00:44:14,482 --> 00:44:17,178
- You from around here?
- I don't get out much.

688
00:44:17,385 --> 00:44:18,943
You got Chivas 25?

689
00:44:19,154 --> 00:44:20,746
Sure do.

690
00:44:21,723 --> 00:44:23,384
Rough day?

691
00:44:25,593 --> 00:44:26,992
I've had better.

692
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:36,737
You live around here?

693
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:44,035
About 40 yards away.

694
00:44:45,046 --> 00:44:46,638
Well, that's convenient.

695
00:44:46,848 --> 00:44:49,612
You wouldn't say that
if you'd seen the place.

696
00:44:51,386 --> 00:44:53,513
Well, then let's go
see the place.

697
00:46:09,197 --> 00:46:12,530
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

698
00:46:13,868 --> 00:46:15,893
Agent Racine.

699
00:46:16,104 --> 00:46:18,163
Back again so soon?

700
00:46:18,706 --> 00:46:21,140
I have a lot of sins.

701
00:46:22,277 --> 00:46:25,075
Your visits
are becoming tiresome.

702
00:46:26,181 --> 00:46:29,981
I thought you enjoyed
our repartee.

703
00:46:31,219 --> 00:46:34,154
As I get older,
I find there are...

704
00:46:34,355 --> 00:46:36,823
far fewer things that I enjoy.

705
00:46:37,025 --> 00:46:39,357
Jesus Christ, Father.
You're in a hell of a mood.

706
00:46:39,561 --> 00:46:40,585
My brother is dead.

707
00:46:40,795 --> 00:46:43,025
I am waiting for you
to find his body.

708
00:46:43,231 --> 00:46:45,631
I fully expect
to find his body...

709
00:46:45,834 --> 00:46:48,302
eating and shitting

710
00:46:48,503 --> 00:46:50,937
and recovering from
two bullet wounds.

711
00:46:51,139 --> 00:46:53,505
This obsession of yours,
it cannot be good...

712
00:46:53,708 --> 00:46:56,404
for your already fragile health.

713
00:46:56,611 --> 00:46:58,909
You can't kill a dead man.

714
00:46:59,114 --> 00:47:02,379
Death is not the worst thing that
can happen to a man.

715
00:47:04,486 --> 00:47:06,852
I don't know how you can
call yourself a man of God...

716
00:47:07,055 --> 00:47:09,319
when you hide
that evil son of a bitch.

717
00:47:09,891 --> 00:47:11,916
I have seen pain
and suffering...

718
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:13,492
you would not believe.

719
00:47:15,063 --> 00:47:17,623
And I have found God
in corners of the world...

720
00:47:18,733 --> 00:47:21,600
in which you wouldn't
stoop to take a piss.

721
00:47:21,803 --> 00:47:23,794
So don't come into my church...

722
00:47:24,005 --> 00:47:26,997
with your grade school
notions of morality.

723
00:47:27,208 --> 00:47:29,335
Right and wrong, good and evil,

724
00:47:29,544 --> 00:47:30,977
they're just words.

725
00:47:31,913 --> 00:47:35,508
Words made up
by small frightened men...

726
00:47:35,717 --> 00:47:38,845
such as yourself
who cannot fathom...

727
00:47:39,187 --> 00:47:43,317
the chaos and the darkness
of a truly almighty being.

728
00:47:45,126 --> 00:47:46,457
Okay.

729
00:47:48,696 --> 00:47:50,220
Good talk.

730
00:47:56,704 --> 00:47:58,865
I'm coming for him, priest.

731
00:47:59,874 --> 00:48:01,102
And you...

732
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:04,571
along with him.

733
00:48:04,779 --> 00:48:05,905
You hear me?

734
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:11,050
You hear me?!

735
00:48:12,854 --> 00:48:14,515
There's no one there.

736
00:48:17,192 --> 00:48:19,126
Tell that to them.
