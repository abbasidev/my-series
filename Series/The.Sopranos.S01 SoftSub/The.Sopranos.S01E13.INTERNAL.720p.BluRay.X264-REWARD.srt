1
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,061
We know what we're gonna do.

2
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,605
Till the government indicts, anyway.

3
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:51,026
Jimmy! This answers your concerns?

4
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,654
I think a lot of good ground
was covered.

5
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:58,033
Okay, I guess that's it.

6
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:16,969
- You gotta get the tickets.
- I got them already.

7
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,721
Fuck! The Rangers
are gonna lose anyway.

8
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,558
You're right, it's him.

9
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:27,771
He asks for a meeting to discuss
shit we covered. He's wearing a wire.

10
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:30,732
You got my okay.

11
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,986
Send a message to everybody else.

12
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,320
All right.

13
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:38,615
See you later.

14
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,963
Who told me you hated
the fucking Russians?

15
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:57,759
The pricks Junior brought to pound
my ass were Russian. I was bitter.

16
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:01,096
Tony's goomar is Russian,
you couldn't ask for a nicer person.

17
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:04,892
- These two are friends of hers.
- I got enough cologne on?

18
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:07,936
Smells like Paco Rabanne
crawled up your ass and died.

19
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:11,356
Easy for you to say.
I don't get young ones.

20
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,775
You'll be glad I got you out of bed.

21
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:18,113
Russian boo-boos, you go for some
foreplay, they'll detail your car.

22
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:23,911
- How's the hygiene over there?
- I don't know. This is here.

23
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,580
You didn't let me
put anything decent on.

24
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:27,956
Here we are.

25
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:34,922
Baby, how are you?

26
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:37,966
- Is Tatiana here?
- I'll go get her.

27
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:44,264
- You are Jimmy?
- Yeah, that's right, I'm Jimmy.

28
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,980
My man!

29
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:57,819
Big tits, little feet.
A hit in any man's league.

30
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,326
Have a seat.

31
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,297
Punk-ass pieces of shit!
You forget I'm a captain?

32
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,676
Why don't you call for help
on your radio mic, you rat!

33
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,761
- Mother of God!
- What's wrong?

34
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,596
Not wearing one tonight?

35
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,765
No time to put on anything decent.

36
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,225
God!

37
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,356
Get the piano dolly.

38
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:44,283
Come on, stop, I want to watch.

39
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:48,662
Kiss me!

40
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,914
Oh, Georgia O'Keefe.

41
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,876
Was that your back gate?

42
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,089
It's probably nothing, come here.

43
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,550
People always say that
in these movies.

44
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,722
Last thing I need is your dad
comes home, sees my Dominican ass.

45
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,642
- Settimia!
- Jesus fuck!

46
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:16,732
I just saw my grandmother. How'd she
get here from her nursing home?

47
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,740
Settimia!

48
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,203
Cakey!

49
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,998
Tell my sister to open the door!

50
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,459
Grandma, it's me! Anthony, Jr.

51
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:39,588
You've got whooping cough!
Get yourself under the vaporizer!

52
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,423
Holy shit.

53
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,385
What do you want?

54
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,637
Go away!

55
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,557
I will never speak...

56
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:54,353
...another word to you
again, Settimia.

57
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,689
Aunt Settimia's dead.
It's me, Meadow.

58
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:59,775
Facia bruta!

59
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:03,445
Grandma, it's Meadow, remember?
Come sit down.

60
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,199
Yes. Meadow.

61
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,620
Oh, I can't stay in this house,
honey bunch.

62
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,789
Not while that facia bruta's
in here.

63
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,126
Come on, let's go see who it is.

64
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,174
Evening. How are we?

65
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:27,260
Make my sister get out of the house.

66
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:31,556
It's 1 a.m. Why were you walking
on Mountain Avenue at this hour?

67
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,266
Shut up.

68
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,478
We got a complaint
from your neighbors.

69
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:37,979
She's my grandmother.

70
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,272
Hi, Grandma.

71
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:43,235
- Hi!
- Ah, shit!

72
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:47,864
- You know this young man?
- Of course, he's...

73
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,495
He's my grandson.

74
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,664
And is this your house, dear?

75
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,923
Where was she trying to get to?

76
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,134
Schrafts.

77
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,388
She's being retested.

78
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,806
For Alzheimer's.

79
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:15,350
It's been a long odyssey
with your mother.

80
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:18,812
Oh, these last 500 years
just seemed to race by.

81
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,024
Listen to me.

82
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,693
It's okay.

83
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,447
Let it out.

84
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:31,032
They're transferring her
to the nursing unit.

85
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:35,871
Which is the thing that
she dreaded and feared.

86
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:39,708
Isn't it interesting how this
memory loss has cropped up...

87
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,212
...right after you failed to be
killed in the carjacking?

88
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,590
You think it was a carjacking?

89
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,383
Of course not.

90
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:53,597
But I got an idea
who was behind it, and...

91
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,308
Enough said.

92
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,602
You don't want to go there.

93
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,188
- Maybe you don't want to go there.
- What?

94
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:02,939
Well, let's track it.

95
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:06,943
Around the time of the shooting,
you were having hallucinations...

96
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,738
...of that Isabella figure.

97
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:13,158
The protective, loving mother.

98
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,620
Your subconscious was shouting
something at you.

99
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:20,081
The day before the shooting...

100
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,961
...you said that she kept going on
about news stories...

101
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:28,006
...of mothers throwing their babies
out of windows.

102
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:30,884
Why don't we put our cards
on the table!

103
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:35,680
You think my mother tried to have me
whacked for putting her in a home?

104
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:39,851
In your worst dreams,
a duck flies off with your penis!

105
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:43,104
- Castration.
- My mother never went after my basket.

106
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:45,482
No, not literally.

107
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:50,278
Look, ordinarily a patient is helped
to make his own breakthroughs.

108
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:55,534
But your life is in danger, so I'm
willing to put the cards on the table.

109
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,954
I say what your mother has,
at the very least...

110
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:01,790
...is "borderline
personality disorder."

111
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,959
Borderline personality disorder?

112
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:07,337
Let me read to you from
the DSM form, okay?

113
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,257
Definitions of the condition.

114
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:14,636
"A pattern of unstable
relationships.

115
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,347
Affective instability."

116
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,561
It means intense anxiety,
a joylessness.

117
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:26,273
Their internal phobias are
the only things that exist.

118
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,234
The real world, real people
are peripheral.

119
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:32,654
These people have no love
or compassion.

120
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:37,158
Borderline personalities are very good
at splitting behavior...

121
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,245
...creating bitterness and conflict...

122
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:43,039
...between others in their circle.

123
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,792
You twisted fucking bitch!

124
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:49,588
That's my mother, not some fuck
in Attica, stab you in the shower!

125
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:50,880
Relax.

126
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:53,675
We're through, you and I.
We're finished.

127
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:56,845
You're lucky I don't
break your face in 50,000 pieces!

128
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,263
Okay.

129
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:19,117
Jackie's work killed him. All
that agita brought on the disease.

130
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,704
His reign was peaceful.
This shooting with Tony...

131
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:25,206
Suppose Jackie hadn't died of cancer.

132
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,709
Who knows how his life
would've ended?

133
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,505
Look at Angie Bompensiero. A fucking
shell since Pussy disappeared.

134
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:38,136
Ladies! Compliments of the house.
Buccating 'matriciana.

135
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,889
You want a pair of hippos
to walk out of here?

136
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:42,807
That's imported pancetta!

137
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:46,895
Will you hate me if I say I like it
here better than the old Vesuvio?

138
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,732
A few bugs to be ironed out.

139
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,276
The one in your salad
was a freak occurrence.

140
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:56,780
My produce man, he's the most
expensive in the area.

141
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,282
Insurance really came through!

142
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:00,825
Yes, it did.

143
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,912
Carm, what'd I hear about Tony's mom?

144
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:05,830
It looks like Alzheimer's.

145
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,916
- Oh, boy!
- Yeah.

146
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,419
I've known Mrs. S since...

147
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:16,424
She's always been an individualist,
should we say?

148
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,469
But she's a real pistol,
what a character!

149
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:24,641
- Poor Tony.
- Yeah, he's beside himself.

150
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:27,018
He's got a lot on his plate.

151
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,146
The attempted carjacking...

152
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,607
Hey, well...

153
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:35,402
I'll let you eat.

154
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:38,071
- Enjoy!
- Thanks, Artie.

155
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:44,661
Oh, my God, look who's here!

156
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:49,958
What? You hiding back here?
Your best friend's on table 12.

157
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,669
When are you gonna bury the hatchet?

158
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:55,422
Arthur, I love Carmela like a sister.

159
00:11:55,631 --> 00:12:00,176
We just don't want this place
to become another mob hangout.

160
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:05,140
A certain amount of that kind
of patronage creates buzz.

161
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:09,602
Artie, that kind of buzz
we should avoid in droves.

162
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,443
Shit!

163
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,821
First time here?

164
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,781
Gift from the Dellacrocces.

165
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,491
Artie's opening promotion.

166
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:26,661
- You will not believe the food!
- That's what I hear.

167
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,372
They'd have to be doing
something special...

168
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:32,041
...to trump you two ladies
at the spice rack.

169
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,587
I was over at Carmela's
the other night, Ro.

170
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:39,799
We had some zabaglion' that,
of course, we did make it together...

171
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,177
...but everybody was raving about it!

172
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,679
Please, you made it, basically.

173
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:48,308
I wish Tony had taken me up
on my offer to talk to him...

174
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,894
...about the carjacking that day.

175
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,604
That makes two of us.

176
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:54,481
Yeah.

177
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,442
Well, I'd better get seated and order.

178
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:00,195
Why don't you stay here,
take a load off!

179
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,614
How's the watch, Father Phil?

180
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,115
Oh, it's fantastic.

181
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:08,703
I can set one of the dials
to the millennial countdown.

182
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,498
- I haven't done it yet.
- Is that Jackie's watch?

183
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:13,625
Yeah, it is.

184
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,882
Thanks again, Ro.

185
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,575
Mr. Soprano was kind enough
to come with us.

186
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,161
You threatened to wait
till my kids got home.

187
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:54,749
Agent Harris explained that there's
something we'd like you to hear.

188
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,044
The Springsteen box set.
I already got it!

189
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,130
- You know Agent Grasso.
- Yeah, how you doing?

190
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,715
Have a seat.

191
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,891
As we both know,
there's been an attempt on your life.

192
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,351
You have enemies.

193
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:18,606
It's a safe assumption that you may
have run out your string in Jersey.

194
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:22,986
The lovely Agent Harris and I have had
this conversation. I'll pass.

195
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,988
You haven't heard the tape.

196
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,824
Play it.
I don't give a fuck what's on it!

197
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:33,454
I understand you and Agent Grasso had
a colloquy about our shared heritage.

198
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,039
Colla-who?

199
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,958
You and I are not compare.

200
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:40,545
You on the one hand,
me and Agent Grasso on the other.

201
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:44,799
Even though our ancestors all hail
from the same sunny peninsula.

202
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,343
What the fuck is your problem?

203
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,431
But we do share some cultural ideas:

204
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,143
Religious, culinary...

205
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,978
...matriarchal.

206
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,689
Maybe we can motivate you to testify.

207
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:03,318
Get the kumquats out of your mouth
and get to the point.

208
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:13,995
Boy, Anthony must've really
gotten under your collar. Admit it.

209
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:17,665
You're looking to crack his coglioni
for putting you in here.

210
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,918
I don't know what
you're talking about.

211
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:23,880
Yeah, and I'm playing
shortstop for the Mets.

212
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:29,344
A psychiatrist.
He's been seeing one for a while now.

213
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,723
God only knows what he says.

214
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,642
You wired Green Grove.

215
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:40,939
It was my idea. Everyone else
thought it was a waste of money.

216
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,903
My cousin Cakey, after his
lobotomy, looked exactly like my son.

217
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:51,741
Empty, a shell. Better Cakey had died
than go on living like that.

218
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:54,827
That's what his own mother
always used to say.

219
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:08,675
What are you talking about,
meetings? Who, Livia?

220
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:13,179
All of them! Raymond. Larry.

221
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,474
Three of my capos
have their mothers here?

222
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:20,895
If this is true, Livia, I mean,
I'm the boss, for Christ's sake!

223
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:24,816
If I don't act, blood or no...

224
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,567
I have to!

225
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,718
Mrs. S!

226
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,804
How are you?

227
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,141
You remember me?

228
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:03,521
- Arthur Bucco?
- That's right!

229
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:05,398
Victoria's boy!

230
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:06,899
That's right.

231
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:12,071
Yeah, you and my Johnny
used to play Little League together.

232
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:15,616
No! Johnny was your husband.

233
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:20,163
But you're right about the Little
League, that was me and Tony!

234
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:25,585
My son. That's right. Yeah.

235
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,921
Oh, gee, what's the matter with me?

236
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,301
How are you?

237
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,512
Well, how are you, Arthur?

238
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,222
Never been better.

239
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:42,685
It's a nice room.

240
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,188
Lots of sun!

241
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,233
Sit down.

242
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:53,029
How's your mother?
You call her every day?

243
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,739
Mom passed away.

244
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,324
Really?

245
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,243
When?

246
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:02,872
About six months ago.

247
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:06,375
Please, give her my regards.

248
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:10,171
Is she still on that crazy diet?

249
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:18,679
I brought you something.

250
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,975
From my restaurant.
I don't know if you remember Vesuvio?

251
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,103
Oh, of course I do!

252
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,897
Way back when your dad had it!

253
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,649
Good for you!

254
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,110
Yeah, I got a new restaurant.

255
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:36,114
Here you go.

256
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:42,370
- Gavadel!
- With a nice duck rag...

257
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,872
Homemade. It's northern.

258
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,960
Oh, northern.

259
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,717
Mrs. S, what's the matter?

260
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,889
Something I said?

261
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,979
You're a good boy, Arthur.
Coming to visit me.

262
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:13,109
We go back a ways.
You made a mean PB & J.

263
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:17,071
After what my son did to you.

264
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:20,366
Oh, how can I look you in the face?

265
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,076
Tony?

266
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,370
What did he do now?

267
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:27,456
You don't blame him
for setting the fire?

268
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:33,087
Well, you're a bigger man than some.

269
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,883
Well, we should all be grateful...

270
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:40,595
...that nobody
was incinerated to death.

271
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,397
Altieri's wake is tonight.

272
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,232
I phoned in a bomb scare.

273
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,359
See, now that's over the top.

274
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:06,495
Junior and Mikey took out the hit.
Start things moving.

275
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,206
Not like we didn't know.

276
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:11,959
- How did you find out for sure?
- No room for interpretation.

277
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,461
Minchia.

278
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,922
- I'm sorry.
- Your own uncle.

279
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,757
Well, let's do it right.

280
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:21,969
Act normal, plan things out.
Make no mistakes.

281
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:25,723
If I'm your uncle,
I gotta finish what I started.

282
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:27,600
He could strike first.

283
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:31,312
And he won't use Boyz II Men
this time, he'll go with who he knows.

284
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:35,441
Chucky Signore. No, Mikey's now
too high up.

285
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:39,028
Chucky's gotta disappear
without setting off alarms.

286
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,989
I just passed my Coast Guard test.

287
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,203
T, anything else?

288
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,872
My ear hurts.

289
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:03,844
Here, one of mine.

290
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:05,680
It'll help you sleep.

291
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:12,853
What kind of person can I be,
where his own mother wants him dead?

292
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,818
The problem is not with you.

293
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:23,197
That woman is a peculiar duck.
She always has been.

294
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,032
That's not the point.

295
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:27,660
And she's gotten worse with age.

296
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,870
You think my mother didn't warn me?

297
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:31,747
Don't start with that again.

298
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:36,377
Your sisters left so young, you'd
think there were contracts on them.

299
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,379
I know.

300
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,214
But you were different.

301
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,842
You tried to make it work.

302
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,596
Two pricks with nine millimeters.

303
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:51,392
My self-esteem is non-existent
right now.

304
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,228
I could kill her...

305
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,564
...with these two hands.

306
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,858
The next time I see her...

307
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:02,028
You'll play the concerned
daughter-in-law, even-keeled.

308
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,323
- For the sake of the business.
- Fuck the business.

309
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,575
And let me tell you,
dollars to doughnuts...

310
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:12,163
...this Alzheimer's thing is an act,
so she can't be called on her shit.

311
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:19,462
Uncle Jun and I had our problems
with the business...

312
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:22,214
...but I never should've razzed him
about eating pussy.

313
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,633
This whole war could've been averted.

314
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,304
Cunnilingus and psychiatry
brought us to this.

315
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:32,558
You had to see a shrink
because of the mother you had.

316
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,772
When I look at the guys now,
all I feel is humiliation.

317
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,611
I'll take care of my uncle...

318
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:49,200
...and I'll take care of Mikey P,
and I'll get some satisfaction.

319
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,161
But inside...

320
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,039
...I'll know.

321
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:15,267
- Relax!
- What are you doing here?

322
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:18,396
Putting the Stugots
in the marina next door.

323
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:21,482
Look at this baby I caught
off the point here.

324
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,374
Just wait a minute!

325
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,877
Oh, no! No!

326
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:26,380
- Look, I need to talk to you!
- No!

327
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,133
Come on!

328
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,553
I'm dialing 911...

329
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:36,348
...because you've given me no choice.

330
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,058
Come on!

331
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:42,188
If anything happens,
they're gonna hear everything!

332
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:46,066
We'll go down to a coffee shop,
there's plenty of people around!

333
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,819
Emergency services. May I help you?

334
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,905
Let me talk to you!

335
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:55,201
Do I have your word that I'm
in no physical danger?

336
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:58,037
I'm humbled that you
would take my word, yes.

337
00:24:58,538 --> 00:24:59,788
What?!

338
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,582
Yes, you got my word!

339
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:06,962
Emergency services, state
the nature of your emergency. Hello?

340
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,103
Oh, God!

341
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:31,779
I take no pleasure in the fact
that I was right about your mother.

342
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:35,783
Have any dreams since you heard
the FBI tapes?

343
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,451
No.

344
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,458
Some sex dreams.

345
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:49,547
- Involving?
- My neighbor.

346
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,924
Jean Cusamano.

347
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:54,176
Go on.

348
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:56,387
We're doing it doggie style...

349
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:58,931
You know Jean.

350
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,183
That's okay, go on.

351
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:05,271
I'm doing her doggie style...

352
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:10,067
...and I finish, you know,
and her big ass is...

353
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:12,945
We don't got time for this shit!

354
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:15,823
It's interesting that you would
say a big ass...

355
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:17,658
...because Jean is quite slender.

356
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,244
We got bigger things to talk about
than Jean's ass.

357
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:24,456
Feelings of worthlessness sparked by
your mother's plot to have you killed?

358
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,959
One of the reasons they
tried to have me clipped...

359
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:29,295
...is because I'm seeing a shrink.

360
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,171
- You.
- Oh.

361
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:33,591
Oh.

362
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:36,385
You know that our conversation
is privileged...

363
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:39,179
...and I couldn't testify
against anybody.

364
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:42,808
Well, maybe they know that.
And maybe they don't.

365
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:45,311
Either way, they're using it
as an excuse.

366
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:49,064
You never mentioned
any of your associates by name.

367
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:52,735
Except for that one fellow, Booty?

368
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:54,361
Pussy, Pussy!

369
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:58,115
Pussy, Booty,
I don't know his last name!

370
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,909
And anything concerning
your Uncle Junior...

371
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:03,203
Shut the fuck up a minute!

372
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:08,042
- You're in danger.
- Get out of here! That's not fair!

373
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:10,711
Oogots, fair.
They don't give a shit about fair.

374
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,175
What am I supposed to do?

375
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:19,553
Leave town. Today. Right now.

376
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:23,223
I'm gonna get some guys here
until you get on a plane!

377
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,559
I can't just do that, lam it!

378
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,603
I have a life, I have patients!

379
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:29,313
Tell them August came early.

380
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:33,359
It doesn't work that way.
I have patients who are suicidal!

381
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,778
They won't feel any better
if you get clipped!

382
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,322
Jesus fucking Christ!

383
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:42,326
Look, I know, I'm sorry, okay?

384
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:46,246
I'm gonna work on this problem
and I'll take care of it...

385
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:48,165
...and you'll be able to come back.

386
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,250
My God!

387
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,837
People are gonna get murdered.

388
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:57,257
Don't worry about those distractions,
you keep your eye on the ball.

389
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:00,469
- I know what you're thinking.
- You have no idea.

390
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:03,764
The cops aren't gonna help you
because you can't give them anything!

391
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:09,478
Don't be stupid!
Even in the short term.

392
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,980
Get the fuck out of town.

393
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:19,738
You've been a good doctor to me.
Thank you.

394
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,252
Artie, how's your rash?

395
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,008
- What are you doing?
- How could you?

396
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,136
How the fuck could you?

397
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:43,595
You took their money?

398
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:46,807
Good, then do it.

399
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:48,809
I don't give a fuck anymore.

400
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,603
That restaurant was like my child.

401
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,939
So they got in your ear.

402
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:58,152
Three generations of Buccos
sweated over that same stove.

403
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:01,655
Even your mother treasures
the memory of Vesuvio.

404
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:06,577
My mother?

405
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:11,373
Don't say she's lying, Tone.
Because why would she?

406
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,833
What'd she tell you?

407
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:14,585
Don't make it worse.

408
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:20,174
Do me the respect of not treating me
like a fucking idiot piece of shit!

409
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:27,264
When you blew up the restaurant, you
made me part of a criminal conspiracy!

410
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,266
Did you ever think about that?

411
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:33,896
I don't know what she told you,
my mother, of all people.

412
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:38,484
Arson investigators gave that fire
a clean bill of health.

413
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:40,277
Why would I blow up
your restaurant?

414
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:44,823
To help me!
You fucking bent psycho!

415
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:49,036
You hear your uncle's gonna hurt my
business by staging a hit...

416
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:51,330
...and that's your solution?

417
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:54,666
To burn it down
for the insurance money!

418
00:29:56,961 --> 00:30:00,172
What kind of stupid,
sick, twisted logic?

419
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:03,926
All right. Ask yourself a question.

420
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:06,053
Am I that fucking stupid?

421
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,350
Am I that fucking stupid, really?

422
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,189
My mother...

423
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:22,194
...God bless her,
is going senile, Artie.

424
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,196
You saw her.

425
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:27,074
I love my new place so much.

426
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:31,036
And this ruins everything!

427
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:39,002
I swear to God,
I didn't touch your place, Artie.

428
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,922
My mother was confused.

429
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,843
Look me in the eye.

430
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:50,639
Tell me you didn't lay a finger
on my place!

431
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:55,435
I didn't burn down your restaurant.

432
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:58,605
I swear on my mother.

433
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,576
Take it easy!

434
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,037
What the fuck are you doing?

435
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:27,551
Come on, look out!

436
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:37,311
It's good we can get together
for our Sunday dinner.

437
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:39,688
Or somebody's nose
could get out of joint.

438
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:43,817
Joint!

439
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:49,031
You gotta admit it, Ma.

440
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,284
It's nice that they
let you out for family occasions.

441
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:54,411
I don't have to admit anything.

442
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,872
- I gotta leave in 10 minutes.
- Meadow!

443
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:58,999
I have to study with Hunter.

444
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,500
Is this pork cooked?

445
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:02,002
The kids are growing up.

446
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:05,923
Gonna be out of the house soon.
Even goo-gootz over there.

447
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,634
You believe she'll be studying,
I got a bridge to sell.

448
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:12,179
You know, I read that last week
in the paper...

449
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,723
...about this family
in Saint Louis Obispo.

450
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:16,725
In California.

451
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:20,354
That whole family died of trichinosis.

452
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,606
That's uncooked pork.

453
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:26,026
That was last year, that same family.

454
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:29,279
Listen to him. He knows everything.

455
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:38,205
Uncle Jun, did you
hear from your lawyer?

456
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,540
Hey, on and on it goes.

457
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:43,877
Ma, don't you agree they should not
talk business at the table?

458
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:46,046
What's going on in your world?

459
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:47,714
Such as?

460
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,549
The state of the union.

461
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:54,388
So I hear Artie Bucco came to see you.

462
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:56,765
Who is Artie?

463
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:01,895
Anthony.

464
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,523
Friend of mine
from elementary school.

465
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:08,902
He owns a restaurant.
They had a little fire in it.

466
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,738
Came to see me? Where?

467
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:14,700
Where are we talking about?
Here?

468
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:30,298
I've lost faith in everything.

469
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:33,760
You moved away
from God quite some time ago though.

470
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:37,723
Is it fair to say
it's not just this recent crisis?

471
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:39,558
Yeah. Back in high school.

472
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,270
Maybe before.

473
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:48,316
I bring the kids here on holidays,
but my mind wanders.

474
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:53,780
I just stare at the stained glass.
People's hats.

475
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:57,868
I'm full of rage, Father.

476
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,412
Murderous, whatever...

477
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:02,164
Urges.

478
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:08,420
I don't just hate this man,
I hate all men.

479
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:12,549
I hate life!

480
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:14,968
Have you talked with your wife?

481
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,511
I can't.

482
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:17,971
Why?

483
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:20,515
Oh, what it would do to her.

484
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,101
She's been through so much.

485
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,729
Charmaine's a strong woman.

486
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:29,733
She's gonna find out
in the course of the investigation.

487
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:32,652
I...

488
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:36,364
I didn't go to the insurance company.

489
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:37,824
Why not?

490
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:43,163
Well, legally... What if I'm wrong?
I could be hit with a defamation suit.

491
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:47,417
Arthur, you know what your heart
is telling you.

492
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:51,588
The reason you haven't
told Charmaine...

493
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,592
...is because you know she'll insist
you go to the police immediately.

494
00:34:56,177 --> 00:35:00,180
And this'll jeopardize
your restaurant, everything.

495
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:03,517
But you must be strong.

496
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:11,358
All due respect, Father,
you're getting off the subject.

497
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,031
Sorry I'm fucking late.

498
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,160
Okay.

499
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:24,412
I need to tell you something.

500
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:29,709
And I want you should hear from me,
not from some asshole on the street.

501
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:39,636
About four or five months ago
I started seeing a psychiatrist.

502
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:45,225
You know, I was passing out
and they couldn't find nothing.

503
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:48,770
She's been helping me with that.

504
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,739
Okay, give it to me.
Give it to my face, come on!

505
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:09,583
Well, I'm sure you did it
with complete discretion.

506
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:16,131
And speaking for Pussy, if he's
still alive, I'm sure he would agree.

507
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:19,759
Business was not discussed,
no names were mentioned.

508
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:25,473
Junior knows.

509
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:28,476
He's decided to use it against me.

510
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:39,279
Ask now, because we're not
discussing this again.

511
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,701
It's not the worst thing I ever heard.

512
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:49,080
I was seeing a therapist myself
about a year ago.

513
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:56,129
I had some issues. Enough said.

514
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:58,423
I learned some coping skills.

515
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:04,221
Look, this thing of ours,
the way it's going...

516
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:08,183
...be better if we could
admit to each other...

517
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:12,854
...these are painful, stressful times.

518
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,359
But it'll never fucking happen.

519
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:22,739
What about you?
You got a problem with this?

520
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,248
What is it?
Like, marriage counseling?

521
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:36,753
Yeah, like that. Sort of, yeah.

522
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:53,228
The Contra commandant
was trying to scare us priests.

523
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:56,106
That's so dangerous down there.

524
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:02,529
It's the de cecco.

525
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:06,908
The fresh basil really adds to it.

526
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:12,163
- Father, you got a little...
- Thanks.

527
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:15,834
- You want a little bit?
- No, please, I have so much at home.

528
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:18,378
So how are the twins, Rosalie?

529
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:37,188
You should say, "Would
you like a cocktail or see the wine list?"

530
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:40,191
Yeah, sure.
I'll do it however you like.

531
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:43,611
My other job, the waiters
do the cocktail solicitation...

532
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:46,197
...but if you want,
I'll do it as I seat them.

533
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,867
- Good. Great, thanks.
- All right.

534
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,623
She catches on fast, that one.
Very conscientious.

535
00:38:55,916 --> 00:39:00,503
She's working two jobs to become
a music manager, whatever that is.

536
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,050
Everything is going so good.

537
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,638
The new exterminators, I got faith.

538
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:14,309
The owner is Portuguese.
They're sticklers.

539
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:18,605
I feel so wonderful,
we're up and running again.

540
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:21,274
Oh, you said you had
something to tell me.

541
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,364
I like the bar stools.

542
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,456
Good morning, everybody!

543
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:38,792
You're in a good mood today, Dad.

544
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,970
And if Chucky calls,
you get me on the cell phone.

545
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,640
Ho! You hear me?

546
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:57,435
Yeah, okay.
I think that I heard you already.

547
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,896
Go take a Midol.

548
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:28,633
Nipps! Nipps! Bad boy!

549
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,770
You prick!

550
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:32,071
Motherfucker!

551
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:42,123
Son of a bitch!
Oh, come on, please!

552
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:44,918
Please, come on! Come on!

553
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,088
Oh, come on! Oh, please. Please!

554
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:51,257
Fucking poison ivy all over!

555
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:57,096
My friend Brendan, you shot him
in his bathtub! No chance to run!

556
00:41:57,264 --> 00:42:00,725
No! I swear to God, it was Junior.
He hated that kid, it was him!

557
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:03,561
Yeah, right, it was Junior!
Mr. Magoo!

558
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:06,940
Oh, come on, please, please, please!

559
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,234
I can feel it itching me already!

560
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:40,181
- Corrado Soprano? FBI.
- Fuck!

561
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:50,441
- Are you Laurence Barese?
- What the fuck?

562
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:54,237
Joseph Sasso, you're under arrest.

563
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,239
Junior Soprano...

564
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,992
...boss of the crime family
that bears his name...

565
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:02,245
...was indicted today
on federal racketeering charges.

566
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:06,374
Talk about timing,
he's lucky he's alive!

567
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:09,586
Along with
Laurence "Larry Boy" Barese...

568
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:12,922
...ailing alleged underboss,
Joseph "Beppy" Sasso...

569
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:16,217
...and 13 other reputed mob figures.

570
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:18,177
Oh, my God! It's Uncle Junior!

571
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:21,973
Look at the old guy,
making him do the perp walk!

572
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:24,183
A legitimate businessman!

573
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:26,978
- Dad, cut the crap.
- Go dry your hair!

574
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:30,273
These indictments are part
of an ongoing investigation...

575
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:32,775
...stretching back nearly four years.

576
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:37,780
They represent the most crippling blow
to Mob activities in New Jersey...

577
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,992
...since the early 1980s.

578
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:43,870
Uncle Junior got busted!

579
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:45,705
Cool!

580
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:48,916
Not seized
today, but named in the indictments...

581
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:53,713
...was alleged Soprano enforcer and
loan sharking chief, Michael Palmice.

582
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:58,718
Authorities believe Palmice may have
fled, acting on prior knowledge.

583
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:00,345
Oh, lucky him!

584
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:04,807
Palmice's wife denied any knowledge
of her husband's whereabouts.

585
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:10,063
He was so happy, he was going out
to try out his new running shoes.

586
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:16,778
And he told me that he loved me,
and that he would be right back.

587
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,076
All right, go on,
go eat somewhere else.

588
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:28,414
Hello? Counselor, thanks for
getting back to me so quick.

589
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:34,212
He says the indictment sounds
better for the Feds than it really is.

590
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:36,255
I wasn't named because the focus...

591
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:39,592
...is some calling-card scam
that Junior and Larry had...

592
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:44,430
...and this Diamante technical stock
thing that I wasn't into.

593
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,599
Thank God!

594
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:49,686
That prick, Altieri,
gave them reams of shit.

595
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:54,857
They got stuff on all of us,
from the surveillance at Green Grove.

596
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:56,401
They don't have a case.

597
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:59,112
An ongoing investigation, the DA said.

598
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:02,198
They always say that,
to make it sound good.

599
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:05,576
This is no fucking joke.

600
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:10,540
I gotta worry about the guys
that got pinched today, if they flip.

601
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:21,217
So you double-checked all this?
All right, good work.

602
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:27,890
Art! Hello, how are things?

603
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:30,184
Good, Father. Busy.

604
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:31,644
You?

605
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:34,772
Like the man said,
"Rust never sleeps."

606
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:40,486
Father, I want to thank you for taking
the time to talk to me the other day.

607
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:43,322
Did you bring your wife into things?

608
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:45,616
- No.
- No?

609
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:48,578
Sitting there in God's house,
I realized...

610
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:51,622
...you can either be a "yes" person
or a "no" person.

611
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:54,834
A positive ion, or a negative ion.

612
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:58,629
I'm not quite sure I get
what you're saying.

613
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:00,923
It's just that...

614
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:04,844
...this woman's always been
an odd bird, a sea of negativity.

615
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:08,264
As a kid, we took her
ravings with a grain of salt.

616
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:10,850
But you also said
the son was unstable.

617
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:13,686
I was...

618
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:15,271
...angry.

619
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:18,024
Complicated? Yes, he is.

620
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:21,861
A little too comfortable
outside the law? Yes, he is.

621
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:27,158
But it would only add to the quotient
of sorrow in the world to doubt him.

622
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:32,789
When the source is a person
who rarely has a kind word for anyone.

623
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:36,417
You seem at peace.

624
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,211
I am, Father.

625
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:40,838
Thank you again, Father.

626
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:43,382
Sure. Okay, Artie.

627
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:49,722
Do you prefer "Corrado" or "Junior."

628
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:52,892
I prefer "Mr. Soprano."

629
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:56,395
Your tenure as boss was a short one.

630
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:58,898
Actually, it was unusual
in several ways.

631
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:01,234
Let me put this to you simply.

632
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:06,155
You can avoid these charges
if you will testify that, in fact...

633
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:09,742
...you were not the boss
of North Jersey, that in fact...

634
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:13,913
...your nephew Anthony Soprano was,
and is.

635
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:19,460
That he, de facto, controlled your
capos with the backing of New York...

636
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:22,630
...communicating through
their emissary, John Sacrimoni.

637
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:28,010
We want Johnny Sack.

638
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:30,972
But more than him
we want Mangano and Teresi.

639
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:34,433
I want to fuck Angie Dickinson,
see who gets lucky first.

640
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:37,186
We want you
to confirm information we have...

641
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:41,607
...through informants and wiretap
that you were allowed to profit...

642
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:45,278
...but you were not making policy,
and were not in the loop.

643
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:48,906
You were positioned to take the hits
and now you have.

644
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:52,785
The question is,
how long you gonna keep eating shit?

645
00:47:56,790 --> 00:48:00,293
You're 70 years old.
How many years you got left?

646
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:11,012
My nephew running things?

647
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,807
Not that strunz.

648
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:16,976
Not in this life.

649
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:25,151
Hey.

650
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:27,486
Here, let me schlepp that.

651
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:30,823
- You got any more in the car?
- Hm-mm.

652
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:33,826
How did you get in?

653
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:37,079
Liliana. She left early.

654
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:40,458
So, what they're saying on the TV
about the storm, huh?

655
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:43,169
Yeah. You want some coffee?

656
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:45,463
Only if you're making it.

657
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,632
Father, don't start that.

658
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:52,637
No, really. I mean it's
practically cocktail hour, anyway.

659
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:54,305
Glass of wine?

660
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:57,183
How about a Lillet? You in the mood?

661
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:03,314
Just came to see how you're
holding up with these indictments.

662
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:05,358
We're hanging in.

663
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:10,363
What we were talking about
a few months back...

664
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:12,865
Think these recent developments...

665
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:16,369
...have brought Tony any closer
to re-examining his life?

666
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:18,329
Making some hard choices?

667
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:20,414
I told her not to use my card!

668
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:25,169
No, that's mine. One True Thing,
just out on DVD.

669
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:27,213
I was over at Video One anyway...

670
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:30,925
...I thought you'd want to take
your mind off these stressors.

671
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:36,013
You want to stay for dinner?

672
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:39,016
Something wrong, Carm?

673
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:41,477
Tell me so I know
how many steaks to defrost.

674
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:42,979
Tony's not gonna make it.

675
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:45,648
Well, if...

676
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:49,235
As I was saying,
my real concern for Tony...

677
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:54,031
Father, he doesn't give a flying fuck.
You know it and I know it.

678
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:56,283
At least for the foreseeable future.

679
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:59,078
- Even a bigger reason...
- He's a sinner.

680
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:04,458
And you come here and eat his steaks,
and use his entertainment center.

681
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:08,671
- Carmela, the DVD is for you.
- Really?

682
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,966
Last week I told you
I'm not a Renée Zellweger fan!

683
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:14,677
You did? I don't remember that.

684
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:18,639
You want to watch One True Thing,
fine. At least admit it.

685
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:24,061
I thought you liked movies.
Mea culpa!

686
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:28,232
Oh, Jesus, I get exactly the same
"who, me?" shit with Tony.

687
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:30,109
Two, I don't need!

688
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:34,655
"Has Tony thought about changing?"
Father, please.

689
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:39,243
You do think I'm a schnorrer,
don't you? A parasite.

690
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:42,621
You denied it,
but clearly that's what you think.

691
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,874
No, you know what I think, Father?

692
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:48,836
I think you like the...
I don't know what to call it...

693
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:53,340
...the whiff of sexuality
that never goes anyplace.

694
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:57,344
I have feelings for you, Carmela,
I admitted it.

695
00:50:57,637 --> 00:51:01,849
It's my job to deal with them
so I can carry on my pastoral duties.

696
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:05,061
How does Rosalie Aprille
fit into your feelings for me?

697
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:09,106
Oh, so that's it.

698
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:14,487
I appreciate everything that you've
done for me, Father Phil.

699
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:16,989
The religious counseling...

700
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:20,409
...the book on Buddhism,
the wonderful chats.

701
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,453
I am very fond of you.

702
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:25,289
More than fond.

703
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:29,210
But I think you need
to look at yourself.

704
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:33,297
Call this an intervention.

705
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:39,512
I think you have this m.o. where you
manipulate spiritually thirsty women.

706
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:43,307
And I think a lot of it is tied up
with food somehow...

707
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:46,435
...as well as the sexual tension game.

708
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,024
Whoa.

709
00:52:42,075 --> 00:52:45,619
Mr. Soprano!
Your wife found you, good.

710
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:47,997
What are you talking about?

711
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:51,792
You haven't spoken? We left
a message on your home machine.

712
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,919
Your mom's had a stroke.

713
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:55,671
Stroke?

714
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:59,216
The news on TV upset her,
not that it's my business.

715
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:00,801
Anyhow, it just happened.

716
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:04,763
The EMTs are stabilizing her
for the ride to St. Vincent's.

717
00:53:06,057 --> 00:53:07,433
Ma...

718
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:10,394
I know what you did.

719
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:13,439
Your only son. Your middle child.

720
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:16,108
She can't answer,
her speech has been affected!

721
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:18,152
Yeah, my ass.

722
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:22,698
I heard the FBI tapes, Ma.
You know what I'm talking about.

723
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:25,451
George Clooney,
don't get in the middle!

724
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:28,370
- Call security!
- Uncle Jun's in jail now.

725
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:31,624
I got one more little detail
to take care of.

726
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:34,710
I don't die that fucking easy, Ma!

727
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,630
I'll live a long life.
More than I can say for you.

728
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:39,632
All right, that's enough!

729
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:41,300
Keep her moving!

730
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:43,135
You try to have me whacked?!

731
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:44,845
She doesn't understand!

732
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:49,099
She's smiling, look at her face!
She's smiling!

733
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:51,018
Get off me!

734
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:54,480
Look at her face! She's got a fucking
smile on her face!

735
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:57,024
All right, that's enough!

736
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:30,975
She go vacation!

737
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:59,295
Dad, give it up. We're not
gonna make it to Aunt Patty's.

738
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:05,467
Dad, hello! We're not
gonna make it to Aunt Patty's.

739
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:07,928
Why did I buy
a goddamn off-road vehicle?

740
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,556
To waste petrochemical resources?

741
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:15,060
She's right, we can't keep driving.
I can hardly see in front of us.

742
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:18,856
- What street are we on?
- I think it's Walnut Parkway.

743
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:20,733
I've got an idea.

744
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:31,452
Come on, come on! Inside!

745
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:34,580
- He better be open!
- Forget the umbrella, come on!

746
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:44,423
Artie, thank Christ!

747
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:46,717
We picked up the kids at school...

748
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:49,595
...we can't get home.
There's a tree across Mountain Ave.

749
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:51,138
Oh, Madonna!

750
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:53,766
We've been driving since 7,
nobody's eaten.

751
00:55:53,975 --> 00:55:58,145
I got no power, I'm closing soon
as these last people leave.

752
00:55:58,355 --> 00:55:59,938
Let's go to Mickey D's.

753
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:02,274
Yeah, all right, let's go.

754
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:05,486
- Let's go.
- No!

755
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:07,946
Come on! Come on!

756
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:10,616
We'll figure out something, come on!

757
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:14,912
They gave me steroids too,
but it fucked me up!

758
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:17,956
Keep away from me,
because I skeeve, all right?

759
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:19,625
Hey, look at this!

760
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:22,544
Hey, what are you doing,
you all right?

761
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:24,213
How you doing, pal?

762
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:26,423
Adriana, you look beautiful.

763
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:28,133
How you doing?

764
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:34,139
How are you?

765
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:39,019
Chiara, her brother and sister are in
the kitchen if you want to say hi.

766
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:40,813
More refugees.

767
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:42,606
The gas is still working.

768
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:45,442
I'm cooking by candlelight.
I can make anything...

769
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:47,611
Whatever you got is fine.

770
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:52,491
Jose! Cabernet, por favor.
Regeleali, right?

771
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:54,410
Yeah, beautiful.

772
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:58,080
No cigars, please.

773
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:08,298
Look at that fucking lovesick
pygmy over there.

774
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:14,304
The skip seeing a psychiatrist...
How does that sit with your ass?

775
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:19,017
I usually do sit with my ass.
Why don't you sit with yours?

776
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:21,687
Hey, Pat Cooper over here.

777
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:26,900
Wait a minute, this bothers you?
You saw a fucking psychiatrist!

778
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,360
Not a woman!

779
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:31,697
I can't get past that.
It don't compute for me.

780
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:33,574
You're the one with the issues.

781
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:36,452
Woman issues.
I don't want to fucking go there.

782
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:38,036
Let's not.

783
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:41,915
Irregardless, I said my piece.

784
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,792
What're you getting at, Paulie?

785
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:46,712
Nothing.

786
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:50,799
Look, he's gonna be the new boss now.

787
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:54,970
In name, in everything.
Wish him buona fortuna.

788
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:01,602
You guys got any
peanut butter back here?

789
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:17,576
Oh, God, Artie,
you saved our frigging lives here!

790
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:21,413
- It's beautiful, Artie, thank you!
- Enjoy!

791
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:26,418
Fuck!

792
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:28,504
- Hey!
- You said "frig."

793
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,759
Wait a minute.

794
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:37,262
I'd like to propose a toast.

795
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,016
To my family.

796
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:48,065
Someday soon, you're gonna
have families of your own.

797
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:51,026
And if you're lucky...

798
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:53,946
...you'll remember
the little moments...

799
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:55,781
...like this.

800
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,162
That were good.

801
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:06,166
Cheers!
