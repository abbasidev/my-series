1
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,898
You should've rang
the doorbell, Brendan.

2
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,443
Hey, you! Yeah, you!
What are you doing?

3
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,737
We found this truck
on the side of the road.

4
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:57,282
There might be transmission trouble.
You should check it out.

5
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,868
What's going on?
Hey, that's the truck.

6
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,079
The one that was stolen in Newark?

7
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,997
What are you doing with the truck?

8
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,710
It's a gift from Tony Soprano.

9
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,883
Let's call the cops.
Those guys killed Hector.

10
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:18,929
I don't believe it. We just returned
the biggest score of my year.

11
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,681
Listen, you fuck.

12
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,184
Uncle Junior's breaking Tony's
balls since you hijacked that truck.

13
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:27,229
You're lucky Tony doesn't shove
the cab up your ass.

14
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,650
What else did Comley say?

15
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:34,153
Nothing much.

16
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,864
There was stuff missing
from the truck...

17
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:40,200
...but he didn't give a fuck
as long as the thing's back.

18
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:44,496
Then he said to tell Tony thanks,
and if Tony needs anything, to call.

19
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:46,165
Tony?

20
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,168
Those junkie fucks work for Tony.

21
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:52,588
They hijack Comley's truck,
I get it, and he thanks Tony?

22
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:58,135
Well, I think you should've taken care
of this Christopher Moltisanti thing...

23
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,637
...the minute it first happened.

24
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:04,391
You should've sent a clear signal:
"You fuck with Junior Soprano..."

25
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:07,978
Take it easy.
We're not making a Western here.

26
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,401
Fucking family.

27
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,988
I bought his kid
a $400 surfboard for his birthday.

28
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,474
Mr. Soprano?

29
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,351
How you doing?

30
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,525
Is that a trick picture out there?

31
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,237
Which?

32
00:03:58,446 --> 00:03:59,655
The barn.

33
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:03,408
And the old tree
all rotted out inside.

34
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,745
It's just a picture I bought.

35
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:09,998
I remember, in a little gallery
in Provincetown.

36
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:13,418
That is a special-made
psychological picture.

37
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:16,380
Like that what-do-you-call-it test.

38
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,092
The Korschach.

39
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,344
You think I want to trick you?

40
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:24,846
- Oh, no.
- What does that picture say?

41
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:27,599
"We're from Harvard,
and what do you think of...

42
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:31,019
...this depressing barn
and this rotted-out tree here?"

43
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,397
It's depressing and scary to you?

44
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,107
Not to me.

45
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,110
But it's got that built right into it.

46
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:40,821
How are things?

47
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,406
Good.

48
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,117
I had a real good week.

49
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,495
A friend's in the hospital.

50
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:50,747
That's never pleasant, but...

51
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:53,542
Otherwise, I'm having a good week.

52
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:56,211
- What's he in for?
- They thought it was an ulcer.

53
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,297
You know, then this, then that.

54
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,507
- You're worried about him?
- Jackie?

55
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:04,052
Jackie's so fucking mean,
he'll scare that cancer away.

56
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,096
Your friend has cancer?

57
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:13,312
Jackie, when they hook you up,
do you make sure they don't have...

58
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,897
...air in your veins,
or is that just bullshit?

59
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,232
What do you mean?

60
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:21,862
This is a good hospital, sweetheart.
Nothing like that's gonna happen here.

61
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:25,365
Air in the line'll kill you.
You know who else...?

62
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,616
Hey!

63
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,745
You know who else has cancer?

64
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,039
Tommy DiPalma.

65
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,417
He's got it much worse.
It's eating his brain away.

66
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,003
Hey, somebody having a baby or what?

67
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,630
- How you doing?
- All right.

68
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,507
- How you feeling?
- Good.

69
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,010
Hesh, how you doing?
Good to see you.

70
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:46,845
Thanks for coming.

71
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,056
Jackie, looking well, pal.

72
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:50,640
Here, Ro, for you.

73
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,559
You're beautiful.

74
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,396
Mikey, nice to see you again
in men's clothing.

75
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,648
I should grab a fire extinguisher.

76
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:03,320
I heard your friend had a spontaneous
combustion in his restaurant.

77
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:06,031
I'm going to the cafeteria.
Want anything?

78
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:07,574
A plate of braciole.

79
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:12,204
- They got grappa in this thing?
- Oh, I wish.

80
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,873
See you later. I got some errands.

81
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,709
- Give Junior my love.
- I will.

82
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:19,586
Hey.

83
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:23,799
Tell my uncle I sent back the truck.
Give me the vinegar peppers he owes me.

84
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,721
Thank God he left.

85
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:32,641
He's a nice guy,
but he's like the Grim Reaper.

86
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:36,520
He knows every guy with cancer,
and he can't wait to tell you.

87
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:40,148
Jackie, you might be a candidate
for clinical trials.

88
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,526
These stem cell therapies...

89
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:46,154
Paulie, he don't want to hear
no more cancer talk.

90
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:48,073
Get the fuck out of here!

91
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:53,120
Trust me, you caught a break being
Jewish. See what I gotta deal with?

92
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,123
Jews, that's right.
I knew there was something.

93
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,083
Tony, you know Teittleman?

94
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:01,711
Owns property. Owns the motel
down the street from the club.

95
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,173
The Jew with the black clothes
and the curls.

96
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:06,925
They're called Hasidim.

97
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:08,802
"Hasidim" but I don't believe them.

98
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,931
- What does Teittleman want?
- A divorce for his daughter.

99
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,433
What do you mean?

100
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:18,103
His son-in-law will not give
his daughter the consent...

101
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:21,440
...unless Teittleman gives him
50% of his motel.

102
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,525
They call it a get.

103
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:25,444
Why don't he just?

104
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:28,488
It's taboo for their religion.

105
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,073
You know about this shit?

106
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:34,411
Run. Trust me. You don't want
to do business with these people.

107
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,956
He said there's 25 large in it
if we can get him this get.

108
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,499
There's a saying amongst Jews:

109
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,794
"When a Jew gets a divorce,
even the altar sheds tears."

110
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,838
All right, I heard enough.

111
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,757
Look, I'm getting kind of tired.

112
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,802
Let's go get a cup of coffee.

113
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:53,513
See you later, Jackie.
Take care.

114
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:22,876
That crash was Meadow Soprano
jumping her cue.

115
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:27,672
Miss Marris, we're exhausted from
studying for SATs. We were up past 2.

116
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,925
- Are you her lawyer?
- No.

117
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,552
Why they'd schedule SATs
the same week...

118
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,721
- Same day.
- What?

119
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:41,311
If we're kicked out of Concert Singers,
we lose our best extracurricular.

120
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:44,105
Goodbye, Berkeley.
Hello, Glassboro State.

121
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:49,319
I cannot wait until all of North America
is between me and Tony and Carmela.

122
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,820
New Jersey blows.

123
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,114
I want to go to Berkeley so bad.

124
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,492
The whole East, I can't deal anymore.

125
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:58,078
So we don't sleep till after the SATs.

126
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,997
Don't mind the mess.
I wasn't expecting company.

127
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,291
I couldn't wait.
I had to see the new house.

128
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:06,419
- Where's King Arthur?
- Downstairs. This plumbing!

129
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,088
- Here?
- Yeah.

130
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:13,093
Oh, I love the coziness.

131
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:16,012
Welcome to the neighborhood.

132
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,974
Well, the school district, anyway.

133
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,851
Carm, you did not have to do this.

134
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:25,772
I mean, we don't see each other
like we used to...

135
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:28,108
I want that to change.

136
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,281
- Could this be Artie Bucco?
- Hey, capitano!

137
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,824
The place looks good.

138
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:38,577
It needs a little work,
but we'll get there.

139
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:42,581
You need some cash until the
insurance on the restaurant comes...

140
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:47,335
There'll be an Italian president
before I see any insurance money.

141
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,212
I thought that was settled.

142
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:52,757
Join the club. They're doing
a second arson investigation.

143
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:55,468
They think you're Mobbed up?
You're a working stiff.

144
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,640
It doesn't make any sense. Who would
burn down a perfectly good restaurant?

145
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:02,934
It's stupid.

146
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,228
Insane.

147
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,192
- Sorry, Artie.
- Life goes on, no?

148
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,361
I could always be a plumber, no?

149
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,905
Only one concept to master:
Shit runs downhill.

150
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:20,118
Yes, it does. Come in the kitchen.
I'll buy you a beer.

151
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,424
- Mr. Soprano.
- Mr. Teittleman.

152
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,343
- My pleasure.
- Have a seat.

153
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,803
- Thank you.
- Silvio you know.

154
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,513
Paulie.

155
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,015
How are you?

156
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,017
This is my son.

157
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,479
Does he have a name?

158
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,731
Oh, I'm sorry. It's Hillel.

159
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,986
You know about
my daughter and her husband?

160
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,488
Yeah, he knows.

161
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:58,406
Do you have a daughter, Mr. Soprano?

162
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,493
Yes. Call me Tony.

163
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:04,871
What would you do if she was
abused by her husband?

164
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:06,164
Talk to him.

165
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,291
Yeah, in ball-peen hammer.

166
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,168
I think you understand my anger.

167
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,506
He's harming my daughter,
and he's mocking our laws of marriage.

168
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:18,259
Look, let's understand each other
from the get-go here, okay?

169
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,136
I'm in waste management.

170
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:24,307
I'm only here because I'm Silvio's
friend, you're Silvio's friend.

171
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,268
You may be having a problem
I can help you with.

172
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,813
If I can do it,
that will make me happy.

173
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,022
Ha!

174
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,816
What's your problem, Hil?

175
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:44,744
Please finish.

176
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,539
You're being shaken down
for 50% of your motels.

177
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:48,748
Correct.

178
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:53,044
The goon squads who smacked these
husbands around to get the divorce...

179
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,088
...were put out of business
by the D.A.

180
00:11:56,924 --> 00:12:00,343
All right, 25%.
He wants 50, we get 25.

181
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,053
I don't understand.

182
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,680
I'm not talking to you.

183
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:18,111
You get me what I want, Mr. Soprano,
and you have a deal.

184
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,529
It's done.

185
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:24,117
You let them in our motel,
you'll never get them out.

186
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,412
That's a commercial, isn't it?

187
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:38,298
Julio, before lunch
I want you to do bedding inventory.

188
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:41,426
Half-hour, and no cervezas, please.

189
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,515
Yes, may I help you?

190
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,976
That depends. Are you Ariel?

191
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:52,979
That also depends.
Are you a bill collector?

192
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:56,149
What is this, the Catskills?
Shecky Greene we got here.

193
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,151
Let's talk about your father-in-law.

194
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,986
I'm sorry. He's not here.

195
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,197
We know he's not here.

196
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:06,701
But we want to talk to you
about him and you. And him.

197
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,953
This problem that you're having.

198
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,080
Look, I don't know who you are...

199
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:15,835
...but any problem I may be having
with my family is none of your matter.

200
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:17,337
So get out of here.

201
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:20,799
No, no, look.
Shlomo is a friend of mine.

202
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,509
And you're bragging this?

203
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:24,969
This guy...

204
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:28,348
You couldn't possibly understand
what's going on here.

205
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:32,769
Shlomo is an arrogant,
ignorant control freak.

206
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:37,273
Look, I know him since before I had
hair on my pitzl. I made this place.

207
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:41,277
The flyers, the car rental drop-off,
the business breakfast.

208
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,196
It was me, not him.

209
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:46,533
So I sweated blood into this place,
and he owes me.

210
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:49,118
And I intend to get what's mine.

211
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:53,164
So, please, don't embarrass yourself
any further. Just leave.

212
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:56,125
I'm not embarrassed. You embarrassed?

213
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:59,045
Listen to me, you weirdo fuck.

214
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:03,216
You give Shlomo whatever he wants
and you forget this 50% shit.

215
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:06,553
You got nothing coming to you.
Understand me? Nothing!

216
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,012
Fuck you!

217
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,807
Bupkes. Say bupkes, Paulie.

218
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,767
That's how they say "nothing."

219
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,354
Fuck that.
This is how I say "nothing."

220
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,440
How's that for nothing?

221
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,280
- You know what?
- Probably not.

222
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:27,365
The fundraiser for Pediatric Hospital?

223
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:30,910
I'm gonna hire Artie and Charmaine
to cater it.

224
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:36,082
Since when do we
open our house to strangers?

225
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:39,252
Oh, you're right.
Let's just move back to Italy.

226
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:43,548
We'll live in a hill town like
our ancestors, put a wall around it...

227
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:46,759
...and throw burning oil on all
travelers that knock at the gate.

228
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,096
Come on!

229
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:57,228
Poor Charmaine. I tried to find
nice things to say about that house.

230
00:14:57,479 --> 00:15:00,815
Ain't that bad. Just needs
a little work, that's all.

231
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:04,360
Those two are so broke.
And that fire.

232
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,488
If that insurance would
get off its ass.

233
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:10,241
- Could it have been arson?
- What's the matter with you?

234
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,747
Hey!

235
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:21,169
I can't believe you guys
didn't get enough for us.

236
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,671
Yeah, put Matt on.

237
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,007
Hold on.

238
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,927
What's going on?
You trying to damage your inner ears?

239
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,386
We're studying.

240
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,139
These are practice tests
and they're brutal.

241
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,391
Your parents know you're here,
cacciatore?

242
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,727
- They don't care.
- She's sleeping over.

243
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:43,107
Can Hunter please sleep over?

244
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,944
Start sleeping, then.
Study time's over.

245
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,237
We still have six more chapters left.

246
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:54,118
Then can you keep the decibel level
down, please? For my husband.

247
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,999
Matt, I'm serious, you guys.

248
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,710
If we can't score some crystal,
we're dead.

249
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,631
With this budget, we can do
three waiters for the hors d'oeuvres...

250
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,341
...two for the champagne.

251
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:12,512
It's such a load off.
This party has me at sixes and sevens.

252
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:15,807
Pediatric Hospital's
such a worthy cause.

253
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,100
Oona!

254
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:24,023
There's fingerprints on the breakfront.
I want this place to sparkle.

255
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,487
She's usually very good. From Poland.

256
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,449
Please get in the car, sir.

257
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:38,538
Like the cop would be calling him
"sir" if the cameras weren't around.

258
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:40,498
I saw this one.

259
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,251
Then call Tony
so he can call Junior...

260
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,670
...and see if we can
change the channel.

261
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,588
Get that, will you, babe?

262
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:50,258
Sure. I'm the only one
who has to go to work.

263
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,052
Yeah, restaurant hostess.
Real tough work.

264
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:55,013
It's your little cousin.

265
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,890
- What's up?
- How are you?

266
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,226
- What are you doing here?
- Hello to you too.

267
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,020
Hunter, what are you doing?

268
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,731
Don't mind him. His brain is fried.

269
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,524
You want a soda or something?

270
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,860
- How about a beer?
- Yeah, right.

271
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:12,196
Just kidding. I'll have a Coke
if you have one.

272
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,781
What do you want, Meadow?

273
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,825
She wants something from me.

274
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,577
In your dreams, Brendan.

275
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,204
So, what do you want?

276
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,417
I wanna cop.

277
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,171
Here you go.

278
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,715
What do you mean, "cop"?

279
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:33,259
Score. We want to score some crystal.

280
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,552
You got money?

281
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:37,013
- You ain't giving them shit.
- Why not?

282
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,932
Your father'll put a bullet
in my head.

283
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,894
Since when do you take speed, anyway?

284
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:45,104
She doesn't. I need it to study.

285
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:48,399
Yeah, right. Hunter needs it.

286
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,069
Forget about it. No fucking way.

287
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:54,989
What?

288
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,908
He just craves attention.

289
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:02,622
Just thought I'd ask you
before we went to Jefferson Avenue.

290
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:06,584
Those melanzane will rob you,
rape you and leave you on the road.

291
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:10,088
What do you see in him?

292
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,924
Money. What do you think?

293
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,383
Fuck you.

294
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,886
- See you, Christopher.
- I got my own money.

295
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:19,931
What about me?
Nobody's gonna say goodbye to me?

296
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:23,893
Bye.

297
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,646
- Bye.
- Bye, guys.

298
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:33,986
You can't let her go to Jefferson
Avenue. They'll sell her Ajax.

299
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:37,657
She won't go there. She just wants
me to give her some speed.

300
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:41,494
Isn't it better if she gets it from you
with all that poison around?

301
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:46,249
Kids. You think you can protect them.

302
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,459
But you can't.

303
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:53,089
With the rainy season,
chicks alter their eating habits.

304
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,675
Are you watching
that nature shit again?

305
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,218
What are you doing here?

306
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,929
My kid stepped on a nail.
I had to get him a shot.

307
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,639
Yeah, where is he?

308
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,224
At the ER with Carmela.

309
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,394
So whatever happened
with the Jew at the motel?

310
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,230
They reached out to him,
he wasn't receptive.

311
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,149
They're going back.

312
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:18,406
- Want me to leave?
- Just looking for my nurse's pen.

313
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:21,868
You got the wrong room
because you are not my nurse.

314
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,911
I know, but I made up the bed.

315
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:27,456
No, sweetheart. I have not been
out of this bed all day.

316
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:32,170
- Sorry, I need to check some vitals...
- What are you doing?

317
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,130
That seems to be working fine.

318
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:37,300
Nobody sends flower arrangements
like New York.

319
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,302
Let me just check his...

320
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:41,220
Oh!

321
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,016
This damn IV.

322
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:46,976
Damn!

323
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,728
I got it.

324
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:58,112
I seem to be having a problem. Do you
mind if I borrow one of your gowns?

325
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,324
It's okay.
It's a private party.

326
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:06,621
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Have a nice night.

327
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,080
Oh, Madonna!

328
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:21,219
I got you, you prick!
You should've seen your face!

329
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:24,180
- You prick!
- "I haven't been out of bed."

330
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,098
Look at your face.

331
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:27,558
Who the hell is this?

332
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:33,147
Relax, Mr. Aprile.
It's time for your sponge bath.

333
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:41,489
She's a friend of mine
from the club. Nice girl.

334
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,868
I joined them later on.
We got a little booze.

335
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:51,666
You were nice to have a party
for your friend.

336
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,376
Yeah.

337
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,259
"Tufts Medical School."

338
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,556
You're a doctor.

339
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,977
What do you think? About Jackie?

340
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:14,021
I'd have to know more about
his condition.

341
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,774
I told you about his condition.
He's got cancer.

342
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,401
What kind of cancer?

343
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,069
It's in the intestines.

344
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:24,198
There was a tumor
and they took it out.

345
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:26,784
And it's recurred.

346
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:30,037
But you said he might go home.
They're not operating?

347
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,374
It's next to something vital.

348
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,835
- I see.
- You see?

349
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:38,087
From what you're saying,
it doesn't sound good.

350
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,880
From what I'm saying?

351
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,174
What do I know? I'm not a doctor.

352
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,510
- You're angry. Who with?
- I'll tell you.

353
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,556
This man has had chemo every day
for three weeks.

354
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,183
He still has every last hair
on his head.

355
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:55,146
Every last hair on his head,
and he's got a beautiful head of hair.

356
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:58,149
So don't tell me how it sounds.
You don't know him or me...

357
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,026
...or what you're talking about.

358
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:03,487
We're getting closer to you
confronting your true feelings...

359
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,656
...about what's really going on.

360
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,492
Wait a minute.
I just told you my true feelings.

361
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,661
You tell me what's really going on.

362
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:13,664
The tree in the painting rotted out,
you said.

363
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,750
Nothing indicates that.

364
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,294
I knew that was a fucking scam.

365
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:21,297
I knew that painting was
a fucking scam!

366
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:24,675
You remember your dream? The ducks?

367
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,219
It took on another meaning.

368
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,723
What happens to a tree
that's rotted out?

369
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:33,184
Trees, ducks.
What are you? Ranger Rick?

370
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,604
Some job you shrinks got.
You think everybody's lying...

371
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:40,566
...while you're pulling scams on them!
Fuck you!

372
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:47,698
There's 37 definites.
We got another 13 maybes...

373
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:50,576
...plus the whole
Pediatric Hospital Board.

374
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:52,453
Right.

375
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:55,164
Are you sure we ordered
enough champagne?

376
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,458
Right.

377
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,836
Gene says they shouldn't be too sober
for the auction.

378
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:04,340
If anyone ever finds out
you got this from me...

379
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:07,468
Look at me. This is no joke.

380
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:11,013
We don't always get along,
but you don't want to see me dead.

381
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,140
I gotta call Hunter.
You're the best.

382
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:17,520
Hey, I'm serious. Just this once,
okay? I'm no drug dealer.

383
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:21,357
I don't want to see you get poisoned.
Your father ever finds out...

384
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:23,734
God, doesn't anyone ever knock?

385
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:27,530
Tell Brendan that Hunter would
rather die than go out with him.

386
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,156
Brendan?

387
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:32,410
Christopher, keep that asshole
away from that child.

388
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,995
He asked me to do him a favor,
I did it.

389
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:38,749
All right, you delivered the message.
Now let Meadow study.

390
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:46,048
Two goombahs
from the old neighborhood.

391
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:50,761
What, they think they're gonna name it
the Soprano Wing in the new hospital?

392
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:53,472
I think you're just
jealous of their money.

393
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:55,141
- Me?
- Yeah.

394
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,143
Okay, but explain to me this.

395
00:23:57,394 --> 00:24:00,479
He offers us two tickets to the
Caribbean out of friendship.

396
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,356
You say no, they're tainted.

397
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:05,734
But for some party,
I take his money to clean his toilets.

398
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:10,072
First of all, Arthur, this is
a paying job and not some cruise.

399
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:12,741
And why do you always
have to exaggerate?

400
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,952
You're not cleaning his toilets.
You're a chef.

401
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:19,707
Good. So you don't mind that he
fronts me money for a new place...

402
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,542
...because he offered.

403
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:24,670
Look at that face.

404
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,716
Oh, God, don't tell me that you
took money from Tony Soprano.

405
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:33,095
How is it different?
I'm a chef. I need a place to cook.

406
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:36,307
How? I'm giving Carmela my support,
that's how.

407
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:38,767
And it's for a very reputable cause.

408
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:43,189
But to have that man as a partner,
trust me, that would be insane.

409
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,316
It'd mean the end of everything.

410
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,067
At least he made the gesture.

411
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:51,113
Name me another person who offered us
anything except the Sopranos?

412
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:54,658
Watch what you're doing.
You're squeezing the quail.

413
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,834
Should we turn on the air?

414
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,253
It's going okay.
Do you like the food?

415
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,381
I was so busy schmoozing,
I barely had a bite.

416
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:12,176
Don't miss those
little veal tonnatos.

417
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:13,844
Charmaine!

418
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:15,221
Sure. Wow.

419
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:16,555
Charmaine!

420
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:27,024
Not in the car! Please!
Not in the car!

421
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,901
Shut up! Shut up!

422
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:31,320
Shut up and get in
the fucking car!

423
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,324
Get in there, you miserable
fucking prick!

424
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:45,167
I can't get used to
strangers in my house.

425
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:46,502
Why'd you invite them?

426
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:52,007
Try one of these.

427
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:57,721
You're a fucking great cook.

428
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:00,349
I cook like this...

429
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,561
...it reminds me of what I lost.

430
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,899
To have my restaurant ripped from me.
I can't tell you...

431
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,776
It was like losing a limb.

432
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:16,198
- Sometimes I lay in bed...
- Statti zitto! Enough already.

433
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:18,909
Forget about the past.
Look to the future.

434
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:23,289
I'm sick of hearing of your restaurant.
Shut up, you depressing jerk!

435
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,583
What the fuck do you know about it?

436
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,587
You motherfucker.

437
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,597
You fucking jerk!

438
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,266
Come on. Give it up.

439
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:49,023
See what you get when you...

440
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:52,985
Fucking son of a bitch!

441
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:57,281
- Get up, you stubborn fuck.
- Please!

442
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:01,076
Too late. All this because
you won't say yes to a divorce?

443
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:02,453
It's not that simple!

444
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:06,582
Why not? You sign your fucking name
to a piece of paper!

445
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,250
I don't like you.

446
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:11,337
Well, I don't like you.
You believe this prick?

447
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:15,549
What do I get, huh? You work
for nothing? I don't think so!

448
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,968
I say we force-feed him his sombrero.

449
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:21,263
She wants to go to Israel,
I send her. I pay.

450
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:24,433
I feed her, I clothe her,
I put a roof over her head.

451
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:27,770
I worked for her father for 20 years
and took his abuse.

452
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,313
So I get nothing?

453
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:31,315
- Stand up!
- We don't care.

454
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:33,692
Tough fucking luck, ain't it, pal?

455
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:36,654
You mother...!

456
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:38,947
Silvio!

457
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,288
Motherfucker.

458
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:48,374
This guy's a bull.

459
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:52,628
Paulie, if we don't kill this prick...

460
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:54,880
...we should put him to work.

461
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,221
Time's a-wasting.

462
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:05,683
I was lucky I could get out at all
with that party tonight.

463
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,563
Shit!

464
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:21,031
- Hello.
- Tony.

465
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:24,785
Sorry to bother you.
This isn't working out how we hoped.

466
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:27,579
With our friend
with the funny sideburns.

467
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,873
Don't say no more on the phone.

468
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,793
I'm coming down.

469
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:35,087
Shit!

470
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,589
I gotta go.

471
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,093
You just got here.

472
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:43,637
Yeah, I know, but I gotta go.

473
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,652
What's that painting mean to you?

474
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:04,074
Nothing. It just reminds me
of David Hockey.

475
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,137
You want something to munch on?

476
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,931
Are you kidding me?

477
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:31,518
Most guys I know would be happy
to get rid of their wife.

478
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:34,146
I tried explaining the realities here.

479
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:37,065
This guy's as stubborn
as a fucking mule.

480
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:39,109
He says it's principle.

481
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:43,322
I think we gotta... you know.
That's why we called you.

482
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,616
I promised the father-in-law
I wouldn't.

483
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:47,451
I don't know what else to do.

484
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,875
You're a stupid fucker,
you know that?

485
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:56,877
I've heard it said.

486
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,837
What are you, proud of it?

487
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:03,967
You kill me and a dark cloud goes over
Shlomo's house.

488
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:08,096
Either way, they'll be no get
unless restitution is made.

489
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:12,059
You really would let me kill you,
you sick fuck.

490
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,355
You ever heard of the Masada?

491
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:21,610
For two years, 900 Jews
held their own...

492
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,863
...against 15,000 Roman soldiers.

493
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,992
They chose death before enslavement.

494
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:32,663
And the Romans, where are they now?

495
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,124
You're looking at them, asshole.

496
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:44,383
Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death...

497
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:47,344
...I fear no evil
for Thou art with me.

498
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:49,388
Yeah, hold that thought.

499
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:02,401
Yeah?

500
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:06,613
I'm with my non-shellfish-eating
friend, and I'm tapped out.

501
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,782
This guy won't listen to reason.

502
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:11,952
Didn't I tell you, huh?

503
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:14,246
I warned you to keep away
from them.

504
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:15,914
He left me no options.

505
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:18,584
He's willing to go down with the ship.

506
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,129
Here's a thought.

507
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:24,840
Maybe he's willing to go to
the world to come...

508
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:27,050
...but if he's stuck here
on this earth...

509
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:31,054
...I know one thing that no man
wants to go through life without.

510
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:32,556
What?

511
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:34,683
Oh.

512
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:37,728
That's a brilliant idea.

513
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,480
Make like a mohel, huh?

514
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:42,107
Finish his bris.

515
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:43,525
Yeah.

516
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:49,031
Paulie, get the ball cutters
from out of the truck.

517
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:52,159
Ariel, we're going to plan B.

518
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:54,912
The phone has been ringing
all morning.

519
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:58,123
The Rotellis, the Trillos.
He has to do with computers.

520
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:01,126
They're wonderful.
She invited us to brunch.

521
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,462
- Really?
- Yep.

522
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:07,549
But it was the food, Mainie.
Everybody raved about it.

523
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:12,721
Cynthia said, "I love those rice balls,"
like she never had arancini before.

524
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:17,100
Really, Mainie, I couldn't have
done it without you.

525
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,603
It meant so much to me,
having you here.

526
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:22,189
It just made it so much fun for me.

527
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:26,151
Mainie, is something wrong?
You got something on your mind?

528
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:27,736
What could be wrong?

529
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,739
Listen, sweetie.

530
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:35,661
It may not seem like it right now,
but you'll get back on your feet again.

531
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:38,872
Carmela, I'm fine where I am.

532
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,125
I know. That's not what I meant.

533
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:45,462
Carmela, I never wanted
to tell you this.

534
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:50,092
It happened so long ago.
You and Tony weren't even married.

535
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:53,679
It's probably silly for me
to even bring it up now.

536
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:55,180
What?

537
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,726
You were at the shore
with your parents.

538
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,479
You and Tony were on the outs.
He called me.

539
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:03,772
He did?

540
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:07,651
One thing led to another,
we started dating each other and...

541
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:10,028
Carmela, I slept with him.

542
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,699
You slept with Tony?

543
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:17,202
Really, it wasn't for me.

544
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:21,873
Carmela, what I'm trying to say is,
stop worrying about me.

545
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:26,837
Really. I mean, we both made
our choices. I'm fine with mine.

546
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,858
I'd like for you to consider this.

547
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,151
Don't give me that.

548
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:51,445
What's going on? Why'd you page me?

549
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:54,239
This guy's trying to pull
some bullshit.

550
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:57,242
Hey, ZZ Top. The guy gave you
the get, didn't he?

551
00:33:57,493 --> 00:34:01,413
But not because of you.
You threatened him with castration.

552
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:06,626
It was business that brought him around.
He wanted 50%, you wanted 25%.

553
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,379
So I split the difference.
I gave him 15%...

554
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:12,257
...he gives my daughter
the divorce...

555
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:16,053
- It's business. It worked out.
- You gotta walk with me, Shlomo.

556
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,096
Listen, don't worry.

557
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:21,433
I'm taking good care of you here.

558
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:22,726
What's that?

559
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:26,480
For your considerable trouble.
As the Talmud says...

560
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:30,025
I don't give a shit
what he says, okay?

561
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:33,528
You want to give your son-in-law
15% of the motel?

562
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,239
You go ahead.
It comes out of your end.

563
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:40,744
Now, we got you your get.
You get us our 25%. Got it?

564
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:42,537
My son was right.

565
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:45,832
You're mud. Godless clay!

566
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,836
I created a living golem!

567
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,505
What the fuck is a golem?

568
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,799
It's a monster! Frankenstein!

569
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,634
- Get out of here...
- Living dead!

570
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:59,179
...before I take your asshole son
and shove him up your ass!

571
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,847
Shut up!

572
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:13,568
Hey.

573
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:16,905
Hey, how you doing?

574
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,199
One second.

575
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:26,498
I got some good news. We're in the
motel business. How do you like that?

576
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,464
Read this.

577
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,262
102.7.

578
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,933
They should take my temperature
with the other machine.

579
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,519
Paulie broke his hand
on the guy's head.

580
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:49,771
- Digital.
- We're waling on this guy.

581
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:52,774
- I'm gonna cut his dick off.
- I'll call the nurse.

582
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:56,069
He's mumbling and praying.
I'm getting his pants off.

583
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,321
They should take my temperature again.

584
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:00,824
Yeah, yeah, call them.

585
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:21,761
Poor Jackie.

586
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:26,308
God has his reasons.

587
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:29,311
Livia, he looked twice as old as me.

588
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,314
So, what's really on your mind,
Corrado?

589
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:35,192
This Christopher Moltisanti.

590
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:37,986
Christopher? What about him?

591
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,989
Him and his little friend.

592
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:45,076
They're slapping me in the face,
and they're hiding behind Tony.

593
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:49,164
Well, Tony always loved Christopher
like a son.

594
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:51,750
And so do I, Junior.

595
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:55,045
He put up my storm windows for me
one year.

596
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:58,673
Good.

597
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:06,806
But what do I do?

598
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:10,560
I just let him and this Filone kid
piss on me in public?

599
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:14,231
And how far do I go before I light
a frigging match...

600
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:17,025
...under that hotheaded son of yours?

601
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:22,489
Maybe Christopher could use
a little talking to.

602
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:24,115
You know.

603
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,618
The other one...

604
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,120
...Filone?

605
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,877
I don't know.

606
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:44,469
You got a lot of sense for an old gal.

607
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:48,265
No, I'm a babbling idiot.

608
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:52,644
That's why my son put me
in a nursing home.

609
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:56,856
He didn't even care I was there.

610
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:01,236
It was just him
and that fucking cancer.

611
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,284
It's like he's already gone.

612
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:09,577
Yes.

613
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:13,957
Ah.

614
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:21,047
Somebody called me
a Frankenstein today.

615
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,382
Really?

616
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,927
This Hasid I'm doing business with.

617
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:29,681
These Hasids, I mean,
they're out there...

618
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,684
...but they got their beliefs,
you know?

619
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:37,522
They're not afraid of death.
This one guy wasn't.

620
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:41,109
Maybe they have the belief
because they are afraid.

621
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,944
I'm not afraid of death.

622
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:47,615
Not if it's for something.

623
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,869
You know? A war, something like that.

624
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,371
A reason.

625
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:54,998
But Jackie...

626
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:58,376
To see this strong...

627
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:00,879
...beautiful man...

628
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:05,258
...just wither away to nothing...

629
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:11,514
And you can't do nothing about it.

630
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:15,894
You can't fight it.

631
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,606
You envy the Hasids and their beliefs?

632
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:21,733
All this shit's for nothing?

633
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:28,239
If it's for nothing,
why must I think about it?

634
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,700
That's the mystery, isn't it?

635
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:36,331
The mystery of God,
or whatever you want to call it...

636
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:39,876
...and why we're given
the questionable gift...

637
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:42,504
...of knowing that we're gonna die.

638
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:53,181
Do you feel like Frankenstein?

639
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:58,228
A thing?

640
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:01,147
Lacking humanity?

641
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:04,109
Lacking human feelings?

642
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,769
Thank you. That's for you.

643
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,230
Say hello to Freddy, all right?

644
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:54,826
Let go!

645
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:11,176
Let me go!

646
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:12,677
Let me go!

647
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:17,182
You're friends of
Tony's goomar, right?

648
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:19,601
Meadow wanted the crystal.

649
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:23,229
If I didn't get it to her,
she would've went to Jefferson.

650
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:26,441
You tell Tony.
They would've beat her and raped her!

651
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:28,276
I don't want to die now!

652
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,613
I didn't mean it. I am sorry!

653
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:35,033
Listen to me!
I was trying to save her!

654
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:37,285
Listen to me! You speak English?

655
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,537
Don't shoot me! Don't shoot!

656
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:58,765
Fuck!

657
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:00,952
Hi, Jack. Bye, Jack.
