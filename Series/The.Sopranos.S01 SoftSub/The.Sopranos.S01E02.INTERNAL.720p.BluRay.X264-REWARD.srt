1
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:08,799
John Gotti, life in prison...

2
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:11,218
...no chance of parole.

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:16,724
We've seen prosecutions in Florida
and elsewhere of top Mob figures.

4
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,185
What are you doing?
Put that back.

5
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:27,359
What's the situation on the ground
today, right now, in the Mob?

6
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:28,527
Confusion...

7
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:30,612
...instability...

8
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:33,532
- ...vacuum at the top.
- What caused it?

9
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:35,617
Your sister's ass.

10
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,162
policy over two decades...

11
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,080
...to behead the crime families.

12
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:42,750
But wasn't it, at least in part...

13
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,961
...a disregard
within the Mob itself...

14
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:50,049
...of the rules that served
the old dons so well?

15
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,342
- If the shoe fits.
- No doubt.

16
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:55,220
Sil. Cheer me up, babe.

17
00:00:56,222 --> 00:01:00,684
Just when I thought I was out,
they pull me back in.

18
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:04,730
Is that Pacino or is that Pacino?
Spitting image.

19
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,899
- Vincent Rizzo.
- Yes.

20
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,860
Former soldier in the Genovese family.

21
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:12,988
Government witness
turned best-selling author.

22
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,449
Do you agree with U.S. Attorney Braun?

23
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:16,909
The party's over.

24
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:20,704
- He is a wiseguy. Elaborate.
- It's not like it was.

25
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:23,373
- Cloning.
- Mexicans are huge in that.

26
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:26,585
- Fascinating.
- Because they work as parking valets.

27
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,630
Do I mean that organized crime...

28
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:34,009
...will go the way of the dodo bird?

29
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,847
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- Mexicans.

30
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,933
- What about them?
- Cell phones.

31
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,936
I'm not talking
about cloning cell phones.

32
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:46,730
I'm talking about fucking sheep!
Science.

33
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,358
I tell my kids,
"Only God can make a life."

34
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:53,403
A guy here asks, "What if they had
cloned Princess Di?"

35
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:57,366
But you know, the heydey?
You know, the Golden Age...

36
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,076
...or whatever, of the Mob?

37
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:00,702
That's gone.

38
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,122
And that's never coming back.

39
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:06,834
They have only themselves to blame.

40
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:09,461
They pay this chiacchierone
by the word?

41
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:11,046
Drug trafficking.

42
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,841
- Oh!
- I think it ruined everything.

43
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,386
You're looking at a mandatory
35 to life in prison.

44
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:20,806
Guys started to rat
so they could avoid prosecution.

45
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:23,433
What's going on
with that Princess Di?

46
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:27,187
Do you think the royal family
had her whacked?

47
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,107
Last time I take a limo in Paris.

48
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:31,984
Like you were ever in Paris.

49
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:33,735
I went for a blowjob.

50
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,115
Your mother was working the bonbon
concession at the Eiffel Tower.

51
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,618
You hear what I told him?
"I went over for a blowjob.

52
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,955
Your mother was working
at the Eiffel Tower."

53
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:47,624
I got a list of people
I wouldn't want cloned.

54
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:51,461
The mayor of New York, that's
the guy least likely to get cloned.

55
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:56,425
So the code of silence, the omertá,
or whatever, just went by the boards.

56
00:02:56,676 --> 00:03:00,762
You're always gonna have
organized crime. Always.

57
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:04,349
As long as the human being
has certain appetites...

58
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,227
...for gambling, pornography
or whatever.

59
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:11,190
Someone's always gonna surface
to serve these needs. Always.

60
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:15,861
Just when I thought I was out,
they pull me back in.

61
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,934
- You got DVD players?
- Don't hurt me.

62
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:13,854
Only people who get hurt
are the jerk-offs.

63
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,148
Now step down, nice and easy.

64
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,234
He's got the DVD players.

65
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,528
Quick and painless.
Not to hurt you.

66
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,196
You gotta tie me up.

67
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,241
- You gonna be a jerk-off?
- My boss'll think I'm in on it.

68
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:29,703
We look like we want a merit badge?
We travel with rope?

69
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:32,998
I've got some in the cab.
Please, I need this job.

70
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,458
Okay, get the rope.

71
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:39,046
I don't know who gave the route,
but there's no way I'd go unscathed...

72
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,340
...without being fired.
- You want to be scathed?

73
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:44,468
So it looks like I didn't
give up without a struggle.

74
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,391
- Oh!
- That's cool. Thank you.

75
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:53,894
That's enough.

76
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:55,854
No, wait.

77
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:57,939
Oh!

78
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:00,942
Ow! That's good!

79
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,194
- Scathed?
- Scathed.

80
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,695
He's scathed.

81
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:11,578
Mr. Miller, my science teacher,
he got his car stolen.

82
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:14,164
You're kidding.
From where? His house?

83
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,000
Mm-mm. His parking spot at school.

84
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,544
A Saturn. He only had it a year.

85
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,713
The security people are a joke.

86
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:26,051
Did you hear what A.J. just said?
Mr. Miller's car got stolen.

87
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,470
Refresh my memory. Who is he?

88
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,390
He's your son's science teacher.

89
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,644
You're up early.

90
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,063
He just bought that car a year ago.

91
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:39,731
So? Insurance will pay.

92
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,691
They don't give full value.

93
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,319
These poor teachers,
they don't make a lot.

94
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,030
So he can work his summer vacation.

95
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,533
You could help find it.

96
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:53,453
I thought I told you I changed my name
from LoJack to Soprano.

97
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,455
Laugh. I'd pee in my pants.

98
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:58,542
Pussy's got the body shop.
He couldn't ask?

99
00:06:58,793 --> 00:06:59,960
I'm late.

100
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:03,839
- What are you getting in science?
- D-plus.

101
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:08,218
- See what I can do.
- That's not what I meant.

102
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,679
He's gotta work for his grades.

103
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,024
I'm going back to bed.

104
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,026
- Bye, Dad.
- See you later.

105
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:28,947
Here, eat this.

106
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,624
Technology comes to the Bing!

107
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,918
Hey, where you been?

108
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,130
- Come on.
- Let's go.

109
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,299
- Hey, is the load here?
- Yeah.

110
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,512
If Serge calls, I'll be back.

111
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:56,600
These new phones, hold, conference,
sometimes I get confused.

112
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,768
How complicated is it?

113
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,437
Answer the phone, take the message.

114
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:03,273
Voice mail only comes on
if you let it ring.

115
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:05,066
Jesus Christ, Georgie.

116
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,620
I hear there's not as many titles
as on laser.

117
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:17,913
There's more coming.

118
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:21,082
My internist said the picture's
not that different.

119
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,502
But the sound...
Way improved.

120
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:28,632
Good. Nothing beats popping up some
corn and listening to Men in Black.

121
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,551
- Fuck it!
- It's the damn wires, that's all!

122
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:34,346
I'll hook it up.
I used to be an installer.

123
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,770
Why can't you be nice to Brendan?

124
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,647
We discussed that.

125
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,694
I was gonna come looking.
It's the guy.

126
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,154
It's Serge?

127
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:52,989
I'll take it over there.

128
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,705
Serge?

129
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:06,419
Press "hold" when you transfer a call.

130
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,004
I'm sorry, Tony.

131
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,094
Now he's not gonna call back.

132
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:17,931
Brendan's a good earner, T.
This jack was his plan.

133
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:20,350
He's a good kid,
but I don't like meth.

134
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,189
Fuck, I gotta call my mother.

135
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,115
- Hello?
- Hello, Ma?

136
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:38,577
Oh, look who calls.

137
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,746
- How you doing?
- I was wondering when you'd call.

138
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,542
You can stop wondering now.
This is it, I'm calling you.

139
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:49,254
I called yesterday.
You were supposed to call me back.

140
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:52,132
I phoned your house.

141
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:56,094
Some operator answered. I couldn't
understand a word she was saying.

142
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:59,598
That's not an operator,
that's an answering machine.

143
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,851
Oh, fancy, fancy.

144
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,396
Here, let me turn the heat off
under these mushrooms.

145
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,903
You and Mom are like peas in a pod.

146
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:17,741
She can't master the phone,
but she's 70. What's your excuse?

147
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,417
What is she doing now?

148
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,843
Oh, my God.

149
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,472
- Oh, my God.
- Ma!

150
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,725
Ma!

151
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,521
Hey, Ma!

152
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:54,444
- Oh, my God!
- Ma!

153
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:55,779
Where is she?

154
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,782
- Who is this?
- It's Anthony!

155
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,201
The mushrooms, they're on fire!

156
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:04,079
Get the fire extinguisher
under the sink!

157
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,457
Oh, my God!
The wall's getting all black!

158
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,584
Ma, hang up and call 911.

159
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,670
The guy's on the second line.

160
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,964
- Aren't you coming over?
- You press "hold," goddamn it.

161
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,509
I can't, I'm 40 minutes away.

162
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:20,595
You hang up and you call 911.
Leave the house.

163
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,431
Look at how I live!

164
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,433
Ma, hang up and call 911.

165
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,236
My mother's got a fire in the kitchen.

166
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:39,447
- Oh, my God.
- She's calling 911. Go there.

167
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,951
- I'm on my way.
- Thank you, baby. I know you're busy.

168
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,079
Serge, Serge.

169
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,414
I can't talk now.

170
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,542
I gotta go to an outside line.

171
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,754
All right. I'll call you back.

172
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,506
Is your mom okay?

173
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,383
Shit cannot go on like this.

174
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:02,345
Hey, T. Hey, T.

175
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:06,099
This teacher, his car,
you got a plate number?

176
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,810
Call my wife.

177
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,817
- Have a nice day.
- Thanks.

178
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,360
No problem.

179
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,119
Ma.

180
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:30,540
I wish you'd let me
get somebody to help you.

181
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:34,043
- You shouldn't be alone.
- Help me what?

182
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:38,339
- With the housework.
- I have my ways.

183
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:42,510
A stranger could care less
about doing it right.

184
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:47,182
Can I tell you something though, Ma?
You need company.

185
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,769
Don't start with that nursing-home
business again.

186
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,647
This is not a nursing home.
It is a retirement community.

187
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:05,325
You want me to make you pastina?
Something in your stomach?

188
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,332
Ma, now, I've told Tony...

189
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:16,169
...and I've told you many times.

190
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,505
You can come live with us.

191
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,591
I know when I'm not wanted!

192
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:28,014
I invited you to share my home.
If you want me to beg, that's different.

193
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:34,729
Leave this place
that my husband and I shared?

194
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,107
Well, change can be a positive.

195
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,194
He was a saint.

196
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:49,327
That son of mine, is he
still having those fits?

197
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:54,749
They're not fits, Ma.
They're anxiety attacks.

198
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,876
You know, he's on medication.

199
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,469
What BMW's charging us for paint?
O trippa di zia.

200
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,224
- It's been that way for six months.
- When was I last here?

201
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,352
Hey.

202
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:17,939
We maybe caught a break.

203
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:22,861
Watchung Avenue said some guys brought
a Saturn trying to load it for parts.

204
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:26,739
Are you saying this car's for Tony
and leave it all in one piece?

205
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,784
Yeah, sure.
It's for the kid's teacher.

206
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:35,540
My guy said one of those goofballs
had a uniform on from Buttfucks.

207
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,502
Whatever, the coffee shop.
I guess the guy works there.

208
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,004
Watchung and what?

209
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,551
I'm fucking Rockford here.

210
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:54,934
Decaf cappuccino Primo, non-fat
Magnifico, double espresso regulare.

211
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,269
I'll take you here.

212
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:02,942
I think I'll have an espresso.
Paul, you want anything?

213
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,694
They got any just coffee?

214
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,363
Our café du jour
is New Zealand Peaberry.

215
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,366
Madonna. Whatever.

216
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,327
That's $4.20. Pick up there.

217
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,246
One medium du jour,
one single espresso.

218
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,706
Here, keep it.

219
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,834
Honey, let me ask you.

220
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:23,713
My wife was in the body shop around
the corner the other day.

221
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:28,384
The guy in front of her leaves
and she sees he dropped...

222
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,094
...his money clip.

223
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,556
But he was already gone.
We'd like to give it back.

224
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:37,435
She said he was wearing
a uniform like that there.

225
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:40,480
Real black hair.
Tall? Little earring.

226
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,565
These stores are everywhere.

227
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,859
Yeah, tell me about it.

228
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:52,992
Fucking Italian people.
How'd we miss out on this?

229
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:56,579
- What?
- Fucking espresso, cappuccino.

230
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:00,124
We invent it and these
cocksuckers are getting rich.

231
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,668
Isn't it amazing?

232
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,170
It's not just money.
It's a pride thing.

233
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:08,591
All our food, pizza,
calzone, buffalo mozzarella...

234
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:09,801
...olive oil.

235
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,761
These fucks had nothing.

236
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,889
They ate puzzi before
we gave them our cuisine.

237
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:18,977
But this, this is the worst.
This espresso shit.

238
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,186
Take it easy.

239
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:25,525
She finally agreed
to have somebody come in days.

240
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:30,905
Carmela called an agency, and they
sent over this Trinidadian woman.

241
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:35,618
But no matter what I do,
I feel guilty.

242
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:36,911
Why?

243
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:43,501
The real reason is,
I can't let her live with us.

244
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:47,130
That doesn't seem practical,
given her personality.

245
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,843
Well, it's my wife.
She won't allow it.

246
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,178
Where are your sisters in this?

247
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:58,683
They cut it off with her long ago.
No way she's bunking with them.

248
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:03,312
So you're carrying all this guilt
when your mother is clearly someone...

249
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:06,899
...who has difficulty maintaining
any relationship.

250
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,195
But she's my mother.

251
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:15,491
You're supposed to take care of your
mother. She's a little old lady.

252
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,285
Not to you.

253
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,078
She's very powerful.

254
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:20,580
Bullshit.

255
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:23,291
You accord this "little old lady"...

256
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,544
...an almost mystical ability
to wreak havoc.

257
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:30,381
Let me tell you. You definitely
don't want to get her started.

258
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:35,511
There are some people who are not
ideal candidates for parenthood.

259
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,931
Come on. She's an old sweetie-pie.

260
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:43,728
What were some of the good
experiences you remember as a child?

261
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:45,688
The loving warm ones?

262
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:00,411
One time we were down at the shore.

263
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,873
About '68, '69, the whole family.

264
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:09,170
My father, he tripped and fell down
the stairs, and we were all laughing.

265
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:13,091
The whole family was laughing.
My mother was laughing.

266
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,261
Any other loving experiences?

267
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,722
Hey, she's a good woman.

268
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,558
She put food on the table every night.

269
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:27,313
I'm the ungrateful fuck.
I come here, complain about her...

270
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:30,858
...and I let my wife exclude her
from my home.

271
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,499
Hey, Ma!

272
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,046
- You Perrilyn?
- Yes.

273
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,214
Tony Soprano.

274
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,632
Ah.

275
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,593
- How you doing?
- I'm fine.

276
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:04,475
Oh, Livia, your son is here!
And isn't he a handsome thing.

277
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,562
And look what he brought.

278
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:13,442
All right, listen.
Let's get one thing straight.

279
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:18,614
In the hours you're here taking care
of my mother, no ganja. Okay?

280
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:22,160
Hey, Ma, fiori.

281
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:27,373
I'm not dead, unfortunately for some.

282
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,084
The tall ones are delphiniums.

283
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:33,045
You know, Frankie Valli
when he visits Jersey?

284
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,423
This is the florist he uses.

285
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,508
Aren't they beautiful?

286
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,927
Want me to put them on the table?

287
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,848
You make sure the bottom
of the vase isn't wet.

288
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,976
Mr. Tony, would you like
some tea or something?

289
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,478
Coke, thanks.

290
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,195
So how's it going today?

291
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:00,364
She's stealing.

292
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,366
Who?

293
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:04,702
That ditsoon, who.

294
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:10,124
That beautiful plate Aunt Settimia
took from that restaurant in Rome.

295
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,292
It's gone.

296
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,421
I don't know.
She seems like a nice person.

297
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:18,174
She doesn't fool me for a second.

298
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,264
You sure she stole it?

299
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,310
You didn't give it
to one of the relatives?

300
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:33,898
You keep forcing your possessions
on people, thinking you're gonna die.

301
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,108
I wish it was tomorrow.

302
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:42,031
And she's so forward too.
Who does she think she is?

303
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:45,493
She's happy, Ma. She's singing.

304
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,162
Anthony, I don't want her around here.

305
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,581
I can manage somehow.

306
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,209
No, I'm not giving in
to you this time.

307
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,378
She stays.

308
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,595
Your uncle called here
looking for you.

309
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,180
Uncle Jun?

310
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,391
He sounded agitated.

311
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:14,939
Jackie, tell them to leave
Comley trucking alone.

312
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,900
Didn't know it was a Comley truck.

313
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:22,697
For 21 fucking years, Comley's put
food on my table, protection money.

314
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,866
- Chris didn't know going in.
- Bullshit.

315
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,911
Want my DVD?
You can watch Grumpy Old Men.

316
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:31,497
- You gonna be a fucking funny boy now?
- Hey!

317
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,749
You Sopranos.

318
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:38,838
You hope you and your uncle can settle,
not be invited to a fucking sit-down.

319
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,465
You got a crew of cowards
you don't control.

320
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,175
Here we go.
Here we go.

321
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,635
You got a ruling?

322
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,435
The kids make restitution to Junior.

323
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,020
Done. It's done.

324
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:01,319
Christopher Moltisanti's
a fucking loose...

325
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,195
You get him out of a sick bed?

326
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:04,697
Hey, fuck that shit.

327
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:11,912
Giacomino, how you feeling?

328
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:16,334
I may be acting boss while your old
man's a guest of the government...

329
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:19,837
...but I wish somebody'd tell
my bowels. They don't obey.

330
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,382
Ah, the fucking chemo.

331
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:28,179
Maybe I should name a successor.

332
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:31,015
This day and age?
Who wants the fucking job?

333
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:36,520
Your mom tells me you got
a girl coming in to help.

334
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:38,814
That's good.

335
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:43,194
All right, I gotta go.

336
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:46,113
I'll see you soon.

337
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,701
We okay?

338
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,161
All right.

339
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:58,417
The smoke he hires for his own mother.

340
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:04,256
Hey, Mikey, how's the boy?

341
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,342
- What boy?
- The one you sleep with.

342
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:08,219
Oh.

343
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:09,595
I'm just kidding.

344
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:11,180
How's Jun treating you?

345
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:15,726
We're covering our nut. Your nephew
retarded? Likes to play with trucks?

346
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:18,646
What if Jerry Lewis heard
you talking like that?

347
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,565
No, that's muscular dystrophy, Tony.

348
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:26,153
Too bad they don't have a telethon
for fuckface-itis. They find a cure?

349
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,280
I'm just kidding you.

350
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:31,158
Come on, you're a good sport.
You all right?

351
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,077
- Yeah.
- You all right?

352
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:35,329
- Yeah.
- I'll see you later.

353
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,253
- Double cappuccino suprema.
- Double cappuccino suprema.

354
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,382
Thanks. Excuse me.

355
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:50,970
A guy fitting the description
does work in this branch.

356
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:54,849
His name is Edguardo Arnaz.
Him and his gay lover both work here.

357
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,809
And I got the address.

358
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:01,397
- Paulie, are you listening to me?
- Yeah.

359
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,108
Again with the rape of the culture.

360
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:07,695
Can we go find these Spice Girls
and get this over with?

361
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,658
Two small café du jours.

362
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:26,672
That's it!

363
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:28,466
What happened?

364
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:31,051
Beats me.

365
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,095
Did you say something to her?

366
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:36,140
I know how to talk to people.

367
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,267
These blacks.

368
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:41,228
Who knows what they'll
take the wrong way.

369
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:42,855
So she's gone!

370
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:48,819
Traffic and weather
on this Tuesday morning.

371
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:55,534
There's a delay as you
get out of the Lincoln Tunnel.

372
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:59,371
About a 25-minute delay if you're
approaching near Deer Route 3.

373
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:02,791
The queue beginning just before
the Bergen Viaduct.

374
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,795
You had orders. Why didn't you
pay his restitution?

375
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:11,091
Restitution, okay. But you
know how much your uncle wants? $15.

376
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:14,386
You got the wrong truck,
that's what happened.

377
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:21,936
I didn't notice you rushing
to give back your fucking DVD player.

378
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,938
I'm enjoying it very much.

379
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:27,816
I screened The Bank Dick last night.
"Did you warble, my little wren?"

380
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:29,527
I'm not gonna pay it.

381
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,321
- Oh, yeah?
- I'm serious.

382
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:35,157
Serious is what happens
if you don't pay, by me.

383
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:40,037
In my thoughts, I use the technique
of positive visualization.

384
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:42,373
How come I always feel undermined?

385
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:47,753
By what I did on the Triborough Towers
alone, I should've been made. Boom!

386
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:49,463
Hmm.

387
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,465
I'm fucking serious, Tony.

388
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:53,008
The books are closed.

389
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,261
Did you talk to Jackie about me?

390
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:59,098
They're not accepting
any new members, okay?

391
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:04,228
You know, you got a reputation
for immaturity...

392
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:08,274
...and it's not helping, not paying
the tributes the acting boss demands.

393
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,276
Acting boss, my ass.

394
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:14,863
Everybody knows you really run things
since Jackie became the "chemo-sabi."

395
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,868
Open the fucking door.
Open the fucking door!

396
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:26,208
Ow. Oh.

397
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,713
All right.

398
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,715
All right. Fuck it.

399
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,466
But 15 grand is too much!

400
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,135
I'll tell you what.

401
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:40,556
You give me the 15K,
I'll talk to Uncle Junior...

402
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:43,225
...and maybe I can get it
to around 10.

403
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,235
One more thing.

404
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:57,615
You leave Comley Trucking and every
other item that belongs to Jun...

405
00:26:57,824 --> 00:27:01,785
...including his hemorrhoid doughnut,
the fuck alone. Got it?

406
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:04,079
Yeah.

407
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,759
"Did you warble, my little wren?"

408
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,094
What will his commission will be?

409
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:21,597
Two, three grand. Ten to Junior.

410
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:24,933
We're lucky we net 500 bucks
from the whole thing.

411
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:27,227
Ah!

412
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:38,280
Who is it?

413
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:41,283
What?

414
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:52,044
Mr. Arnaz?

415
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:53,629
What do you want?

416
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,840
You seen a schoolteacher's
Saturn around here?

417
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,637
Come here!

418
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:05,099
Anybody else here, Desi?

419
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,893
- Eddie, I'm ready.
- Yep.

420
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,228
Here comes Lucy.

421
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:12,231
Those people at the airport
shuttle are always late.

422
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,191
- Uh!
- Eddie!

423
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,819
You boys drove off in the wrong car.

424
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,988
We ain't saying shit
until there's an attorney.

425
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,741
Well, go ahead. Make a statement.

426
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:25,035
I got fucking Johnny Cochran here!

427
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,633
You boys put a crimp in my week.

428
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:42,720
- Ah, mannaggia!
- Get over there.

429
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,890
Hey, Puss, here's the fucking set.

430
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:49,351
Look.

431
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:52,438
Fucking car's been chopped. Useless.

432
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:53,731
That's not it.

433
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:57,234
Then why is that car inside there?
That Dodge?

434
00:28:57,485 --> 00:29:01,780
Why is that motherfucker wearing the
fucking plate number I had all week?

435
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:04,575
- I don't know.
- Here's what's gonna happen.

436
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:08,704
The two of youse are climbing over that
fence and shagging those plates.

437
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:10,497
But the razor wire.

438
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:15,878
Then one of you stays with us while
the other goes and gets another Saturn.

439
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:27,806
- On the lookout for ducks?
- Know the old man pretty good.

440
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:31,935
Don't look so sad. Remember how
pissed you were about the pool filter?

441
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:37,149
They were special, them coming here,
huh? Don't you think?

442
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,650
I wasn't into it.

443
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,907
What time's Grandma getting here?

444
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,409
She had to drive
Fanny to the doctor's.

445
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,996
Then she is picking up my parents
and they're coming here.

446
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:54,249
They're each bringing
some antipasto.

447
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:59,296
I complain about my mother,
about how she just sits at home...

448
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:00,964
...and feels sorry for herself.

449
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:06,011
But she's always ready to drive those
friends of hers that can't drive.

450
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:10,432
I'm proud of her. It gives me hope.

451
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,622
It's getting chilly out here.

452
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:37,543
Make plenty of noise
before you open the front door.

453
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,920
You never know who's in there.

454
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:43,924
There's my Star-Ledger. Thanks.

455
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:48,929
Oh, this street,
another pain in the ass.

456
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:56,228
She broke her wrist
on the steering column.

457
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,063
A minor concussion.

458
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:00,649
What about the other woman?

459
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:03,861
Hip.

460
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:10,617
We were at the hospital till 2 a.m...

461
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:15,998
...talking to her doctor
and the staff gerontoligist.

462
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,750
They say she shouldn't
live alone anymore.

463
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:24,172
She can't manage the telephone.

464
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:28,844
Yet you say she's healthy and alert.

465
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,263
Like a bull.

466
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:33,765
Why?

467
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:36,268
I'm just thinking.

468
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:41,398
I know there are other doctors there,
but you know from your own life...

469
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:46,111
...that depression can cause
accidents, poor performance or worse.

470
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:48,155
So, what are you saying?

471
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:50,657
Unconsciously she tried
to whack her friend?

472
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:55,245
It's interesting that you would even
take that from what I said.

473
00:31:57,123 --> 00:32:01,168
Either way, she could need a change
in her living situation...

474
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:02,711
...be around more people.

475
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,297
We were looking at Green Grove.

476
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:06,965
It's a beautiful facility.

477
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:12,054
It's more like a hotel
at Cap d'Antibes.

478
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,265
Yeah.

479
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:21,146
- But to her it's a nursing home.
- She needs to see the distinction.

480
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:25,484
That, in fact, she's embarking
on a rewarding chapter.

481
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:30,572
I know seniors who are inspired
and inspiring.

482
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,413
You're not forgetting us, buddy?

483
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,167
Ladies.

484
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:50,759
Hey, Kenny Portugal said
to say hello.

485
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,594
Oh, yeah. Kenny.

486
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,267
The fuck is with this cocksucker?

487
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,604
Back up! Mr. Scorsese, good evening.

488
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:05,482
Whoa! Wow!

489
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,401
Marty!

490
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:09,528
Kundun! I liked it.

491
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,790
So my boy at Comley...

492
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,710
...said there's a load
of Italian suits.

493
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:28,672
Those unload fast.
Mario'll take the whole load.

494
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:32,217
He says shipment moves
Thursday at 6 a.m.

495
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:38,682
Give me one good reason
I should not jack this truck.

496
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:43,645
It's Junior's own fault. He gives us
no choice except to do it again.

497
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:45,689
Taking that outrageous tribute.

498
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:50,193
He shits on our heads, we're
supposed to say thanks for the hat.

499
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:54,489
I'm getting nowhere playing
by the rules. Fuck Tony.

500
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,867
"The books are closed." Blow me.

501
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,326
That's some true shit.

502
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:01,621
They're not confirming any
new made guys. How come?

503
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:05,542
Fucking chaos. Nobody knows
who's running things anymore.

504
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:10,380
Guys don't know who to make payments
up the ladder to in some cases.

505
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:14,009
I'm talking about the year 2000.
The millennium.

506
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:16,636
Where do we go from here?

507
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:26,938
Oh.

508
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:29,900
Ma, this Virginia ham...

509
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,486
Go on, get yourself some more.

510
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:34,488
No, I'm full.

511
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,239
It's good, though.

512
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:39,076
You never let me feed you.

513
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:45,040
So getting back
to what we were talking about.

514
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:47,084
- You want that lamp?
- Lie down.

515
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:52,089
That lamp, that's real ormolu. You
know what that's worth when it's new?

516
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,591
We're fixed good lamp-wise, thank you.

517
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,968
Take it and take the Barcalounger.

518
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:01,890
Somebody's gotta take
this stuff before I die.

519
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:05,602
Otherwise there's gonna be
a lot of stuff here...

520
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:08,897
...that the junkman's gonna
have to cart off to the dump.

521
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:14,152
Mom, you're not gonna die. Your
stuff won't be hauled off to the dump.

522
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:18,782
Plan for the future. The most rewarding
chapter of your life's coming up.

523
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:23,161
- You know my good jewelry?
- The stuff Dad gave you.

524
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:26,915
Some of those pieces came right
out of Cartier's window.

525
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,835
Listen, Carm doesn't want it.

526
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,628
Not now.

527
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:36,967
We want you to live long and wear your
sparklers to grandkids' graduations.

528
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,928
I gave it all
to your cousin Josephine.

529
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,848
The fuck?
The good jewelry?

530
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:45,058
She always admired it.

531
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:46,977
They don't have much.

532
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:51,148
You gave her Cartier rings,
and you give me a vibrating chair?

533
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:55,110
Your wife never showed
any interest in my jewels.

534
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:58,864
She never complimented me
on any of it, as I remember.

535
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:04,244
Before you do more damage to yourself
or your grandchildrens' inheritance...

536
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:06,204
...you'll stop living alone.

537
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:08,707
I'm not going to that nursing home.

538
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:12,919
Green Grove is a retirement community!
It's like a hotel at Captain Teeb's!

539
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:14,337
Who's he?

540
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:18,008
A captain who owns luxury hotels
or something.

541
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:22,888
I talked to Mrs. DiCaprio, and she's
got a corner suite available.

542
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,056
It's available. It'll go fast.

543
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,642
Of course it's available.
Somebody died!

544
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:33,231
You gotta stop with this black poison
cloud all the time. I can't take it!

545
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,650
Oh, poor you!

546
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:39,112
I got problems at work,
problems at home.

547
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:41,823
I got a friend diagnosed with cancer.

548
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:45,702
Most parents would be grateful
if their children did this!

549
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:47,746
I'm not going to that place.

550
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,875
I will go to court and get power
of attorney and place you there.

551
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,293
Then kill me now.

552
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,921
Go on, go into the ham...

553
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:59,549
...and take the carving knife
and stab me here.

554
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:04,930
Here! Now please, it would hurt me
less than what you just said.

555
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,390
I know seniors that are inspired!

556
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:20,987
Yo, money, we said we'd meet out
front, and you're not even dressed!

557
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:22,948
I'm taking a pass.

558
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:27,452
What? It's Italian suits, Christopher.

559
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:31,957
There was a time when being with
Tony's crew was all I ever dreamed of.

560
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:34,251
So what am I doing?

561
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,628
This is some fucking note here.

562
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:37,921
Don't wake her up.

563
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:40,298
Come on, it's 5:15.

564
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:45,178
Maybe one reason things are so fucked
in the organization these days...

565
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:49,182
...is guys running off not listening
to middle management.

566
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,269
"Fuck Tony." That's a quote.

567
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,771
We have to stick together.

568
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,190
Why be in a crew?

569
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,733
Why be a gangster?

570
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,402
Hey, coach?

571
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:01,778
Suck my dick.

572
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:02,946
Yeah.

573
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:21,923
Yo! Hey! Yo!
We need some help over here!

574
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:29,389
Okay, let's be very cool, yo!
Get down out of the cab!

575
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:31,266
You heard the motherfucker.

576
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:34,644
I'm a friend of Billy's.
Your friend on the inside.

577
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:37,856
Yeah, cool. "Increase the peace,"
that's our motto.

578
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:42,110
- I'm gonna take my lunch, okay?
- Yeah, whatever. Come on.

579
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:49,451
Hold up, man.
You can't drive a Fisher Price.

580
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,916
What's with the gun pointed sideways?

581
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:06,843
Get out! Come on, get down!
You drive, I'll direct you.

582
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,141
Jesus!

583
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,685
Control your shit, fool!

584
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:21,941
Fuck, I'm fucked! Fuck!

585
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:24,903
Fuck!

586
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:30,367
Fuck! Junior-fucking-Soprano's
gonna go ape-shit. Fuck!

587
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:35,789
You excited about coming
to live with us, hon?

588
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,209
You will be. Trust me.

589
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:42,587
Look, Ma, here's your stuff.

590
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,715
- Wow, they made good time.
- Yeah.

591
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:50,929
You got your own bed and your dresser.

592
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:54,933
You know, when my grandmother
went to live... elsewhere...

593
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:58,019
...they weren't allowed
personal effects.

594
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:04,901
All right, Ma, sign right here.

595
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:16,996
Yes?

596
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:20,208
Mr. Soprano, do you have
an Uncle Junior?

597
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:22,001
He tracked me down here?

598
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:24,838
Line two? Here you go.

599
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,631
I'll call him back.

600
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:29,717
He'll return the call. He did?

601
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:35,140
It's urgent. She said he sounded
upset. He'll call back.

602
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:43,106
Livia, did you ever hear the old
Italian saying? My aunt used to go:

603
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:46,317
"Col tempo la foglia
di gelso diventa seta."

604
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,575
What's that mean, Bonnie?

605
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:57,745
Time and patience change
the mulberry leaf to silk.

606
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:13,761
You gonna be all right?

607
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,139
Yeah, sure.

608
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,433
Thanks for all your help.

609
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,312
I'll make us a nice lunch.

610
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:25,315
I've got some fantastic
prosciutto in there.

611
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:29,694
Hello?

612
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:32,113
Yeah. It's Christopher.

613
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:34,532
Yeah.

614
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:37,494
I've been calling for hours.
Call me on an outside line.

615
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:55,094
T, don't get mad.
There's been a little shit.

616
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:57,514
- I had nothing to do with it...
- Spit it out!

617
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:00,099
Brendan hit Comley again.

618
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:02,060
He what?

619
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:07,815
- And the driver, you know...
- No, I don't know.

620
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:12,403
He caught some friendly fire
or something and he's gone.

621
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,031
Oh, fuck!

622
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,450
What do we do, T?
Brendan didn't fence the load.

623
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:21,037
He's thinking it was Mario
who dimed us to Junior last time.

624
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:22,622
Fuck!

625
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:42,475
Hey, Ton.

626
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:45,603
Sorry you have to wreck
your Saturday like this.

627
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:51,442
You boys. You boys, I'll tell you.

628
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:56,781
It's beautiful stuff, though.

629
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:58,866
- Ton, I'm so sorry.
- Shut up.

630
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:01,869
Just so you realize I had
nothing to do with this.

631
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,622
- Ton, that's true. He stood home.
- Shut up.

632
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:06,874
Stood home?

633
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:12,922
Did you do anything to stop it?
Did you offer any guidance?

634
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:16,593
What do we mean when we say
leadership, hm?

635
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:20,888
Part of it's the crank. But I'm
going into detox, swear on my mother.

636
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:24,809
Brendan, shut the fuck up.
You want to get me clipped?

637
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:29,105
What are we gonna do?

638
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:34,444
You're gonna put these suits back
in the truck and give them back.

639
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:35,903
Fuck!

640
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:38,406
Then call my uncle
and tell him it's done.

641
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,492
What about the dead guy?

642
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:45,079
Prod him with a stick.
Light a candle to St. Anthony.

643
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:46,956
But I think you're fucked.

644
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,294
Ton...

645
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:55,590
...what if this didn't go back?
Would it be a problem?

646
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:02,347
I don't see you assholes putting
that rack, and that rack...

647
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:04,849
...and this rack here
back in the truck.

648
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:17,737
Just when I thought I was out,
they pull me back in.

649
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,030
Hmm!

650
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:23,117
Hey, Mr. Miller, your car is back.

651
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:27,163
My wife dropped me off
and there it was, in my parking spot.

652
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:29,499
My Uncle Pussy
helped my dad locate it.

653
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:31,125
Uncle Pussy?

654
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:33,836
He's in the car business.

655
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:38,007
I don't know what to say to your
dad, I mean, thanks of course.

656
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:40,093
It's nice and clean too.

657
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,387
Whoa, different keys!

658
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:47,600
It's probably too much to hope my
papers are still inside the trunk.

659
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:49,894
It's a different color.

660
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:52,397
Whoa. Ooh.

661
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:56,567
My dad's a hero.

662
00:45:56,879 --> 00:46:00,381
Did you actually lose
consciousness like with the ducks?

663
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:02,008
No.

664
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:08,264
Just a shortness of breath and
the white spots in my field of vision.

665
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:10,224
Improvement.

666
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,685
Because I'm sad to put my mother away?

667
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:15,938
Sad is good. Unconscious isn't.

668
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:21,444
She'll be in very good hands.
You've done the best for her.

669
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:25,281
She won't speak to me.

670
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:30,077
That is sad.
But whose choice is that?

671
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:32,538
Somehow that doesn't make it
any better.

672
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:37,293
Can you admit to yourself that yes,
you're sad...

673
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:40,421
...but you're angry and full of rage?

674
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:41,923
I'm sad.

675
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:44,383
It's hard to admit that...

676
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:48,346
...you may have feelings of hatred
towards your mother, isn't it?

677
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:50,431
You're out of your tree.

678
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:54,685
Listen carefully.
Of course you love her.

679
00:46:55,729 --> 00:47:00,441
What I'm trying to say is, own
the anger instead of displacing it.

680
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:04,862
Otherwise it defines your life.
It needs to be acknowledged.

681
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:08,658
It's a good thing time is up.
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

682
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,159
"Hate your mother."

683
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:41,732
