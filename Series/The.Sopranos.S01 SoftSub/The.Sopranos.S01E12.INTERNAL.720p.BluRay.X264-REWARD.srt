1
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,275
Junior, hey.

2
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,111
Jimmy, how you doing, kid?

3
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,488
How many of these things
we gotta go to?

4
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:57,574
Filone's mom at the kid's
funeral, the way she carried on.

5
00:01:57,992 --> 00:01:59,159
Fucking manners.

6
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:03,247
I want you to know I always thought
you had that right too. You know?

7
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,668
Jimmy, let me tell you something.
Don't worry about what I know.

8
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,848
I was just over to Tony's house.

9
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:23,892
Oh, yeah? How was he?

10
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,645
He looked...

11
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:28,272
...tired.

12
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,108
Maybe he's got hypoglycemia.

13
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:34,278
- Maybe he's depressed.
- What's he depressed about?

14
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,446
He talked to me about it.

15
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,658
- Depression?
- Well...

16
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,910
What do you know about depression?

17
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:46,915
Nothing, but he sleeps all the time,
he's not taking care of himself...

18
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,750
Top guys have dark moods.

19
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:52,754
Winston Churchill drank a quart of
brandy before breakfast.

20
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,757
And Napoleon,
he was a moody fuck too.

21
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:06,268
Am I nuts? A day at the mall
in mules and I'll be crippled for life.

22
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:15,652
I told Lilliana to put some
giambotto in the microwave for you.

23
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:21,283
How are you fixed for sweat socks?
We'll be by the Sports Authority.

24
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:25,746
Tony?

25
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,500
I know you're in there!
I know you hear me!

26
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,002
Will you let me sleep?

27
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:36,131
Does your therapist know about this?
Maybe you need more medication.

28
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,842
She's got me on lithium
and Prozac. What else?

29
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:41,011
Aromatherapy, something.

30
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:42,763
This is not normal...

31
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,724
...for a healthy adult male to take
to bed like this.

32
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:47,684
I got a lot on my mind.

33
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,020
Oh, really? Well, move over, then.

34
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,774
Those indictments are hanging over
my head too.

35
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,152
Plus I got the roots in
the pipe to the street.

36
00:03:57,362 --> 00:04:01,823
My best friend, Pussy, has disappeared.
He's probably fucking dead, okay?

37
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:05,869
This downturn started long before
Pussy Bompensiero disappeared.

38
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:12,584
If you want me, I will be at
the Paramus Mall...

39
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:17,798
...getting your son a suit to wear
to his first formal.

40
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,057
Carmela, come on!

41
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:28,892
Sunlight is good for people.

42
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:33,021
In Alaska, they wear little light hats
so they don't get depressed.

43
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:39,856
Sorry, Junior.

44
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:43,235
The Jackson Street Bridge was up.

45
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:44,903
If you say you'll be someplace...

46
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,197
...be someplace!
Sorry.

47
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,658
Junior, you all right?

48
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,828
Pork-chop boy was here.
That fucking Altieri!

49
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,957
Running his mouth about
the Brendan Filone hit.

50
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,627
Is that what him and my capos
talk about behind my back?

51
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:02,963
The meeting's adjourned at
the Green Grove.

52
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,632
Chucky and I spoke to Donnie P.,
and the thing...

53
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:07,968
...it's happening tomorrow.

54
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,053
That quick? Good.

55
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:12,556
Yeah. Black guys.

56
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,599
It'll never lead back.

57
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,102
They got a pisciatoio in this place?

58
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:21,106
Look at her like that.

59
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:25,277
Mariolina gave me my first hand job.
Me and Vincent Miniscalco...

60
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,113
...in the alley behind
the chicken market.

61
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:31,700
What am I saying
at this poor woman's wake?

62
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,786
I wanted to let you know
so you don't worry.

63
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:37,789
Everything's taken care of about Tony.

64
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,418
When I was a little kid
like that...

65
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:44,880
...I always used to wonder why nobody
collected prayer cards...

66
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,632
...like they collect baseball cards.

67
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:52,387
Thousands of bucks for Honus Wagner...

68
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,014
...and jack shit for Jesus.

69
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:57,392
It's going down at a newsstand
by the medical center.

70
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:01,438
Where he spills his guts on some
fucking shrink's carpet.

71
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:05,066
Junior, these guys are very, very good.

72
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:09,738
Donnie Paduana did time with them at
Rahway. And I was very specific.

73
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:13,575
He's not gonna suffer. He'll have
an open casket, I promise.

74
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:16,870
Enough! I don't want
to hear anymore!

75
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:19,873
Jesus, Michael,
if I delegate, I delegate.

76
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:23,919
Is that what time it is?

77
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:29,716
There is absolutely nothing on the
street about the big guy, anywhere.

78
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,597
I went to see his family.

79
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:40,227
Angela doesn't know shit, or she
deserves an Academy fucking Award.

80
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:42,270
His goomar either.

81
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,649
I don't wanna hear no more talking
about Pussy.

82
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:50,028
Mr. Tony, let me take that robe
and wash it for you.

83
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,531
Did I ask you to take the robe?

84
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,206
Jimmy Altieri was in the Bing.

85
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,751
Can't even look him
in the face anymore.

86
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:08,004
If he's wired, it's doing jack shit...

87
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,840
...because all we feed him is
deliberate bullshit...

88
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,677
...till we can, you know...

89
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,680
Don't do nothing about Jimmy.

90
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,766
I don't even know if he's
the guy that flipped.

91
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,895
I don't know nothing no more.

92
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:30,819
Pussy probably freaked out and he's
lamming it, that's all.

93
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,866
How many times do I gotta say it?

94
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,624
- You want me to drive you somewhere?
- No.

95
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,501
I usually drive you.

96
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:51,131
- I'm going downstairs.
- What are you gonna do?

97
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:54,593
I'm gonna get my pants out of
the fucking drier, okay?

98
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,755
- Hello.
- Hi.

99
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:35,050
Is this yours?
I found it in the yard.

100
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,552
Oh, no. Really?

101
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,098
Thought the Cusamanos were away.

102
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,644
Yeah, they went in Bermuda
to play golf.

103
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,648
You're from Italy, aren't you?

104
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:53,568
- My English is pitiful.
- No.

105
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,570
You speak very good.

106
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,324
Your English is better than
my Italian.

107
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,077
Principles of Oral Surgery?

108
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:03,495
I'm a student.

109
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:08,083
I'm here as part of a exchange program
between our two countries.

110
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:12,879
Boy, if my dentist looked like you
I'd stay awake during a root canal.

111
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:15,340
All right...

112
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,258
...I'll let you study.

113
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:21,262
Thank you for bring me...
Come si dice "biancheria"?

114
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,682
I don't know how to say in English.

115
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,934
Well, that makes two of us.

116
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,355
Bye.

117
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:16,693
That's him.

118
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:22,031
Remember, they don't want
nothing above the neck.

119
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:26,828
Let's do it.

120
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,248
Whoa.

121
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:37,714
Doughnuts?
No wonder he can't lose weight.

122
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,883
Where's he going now?

123
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,346
Yo, sir?

124
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,848
- Excuse me.
- What?

125
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:48,850
Could you pull forward?

126
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,978
- Give me a minute.
- Police department.

127
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:53,688
Where's your badge?

128
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,940
I said move this piece of shit, now!

129
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,651
Get the fuck out of my face.

130
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:07,202
We'll have to waste this
motherfucker too?

131
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:10,497
Let him get his doughnuts.
We'll pop him when he gets out.

132
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,059
Where's he going?

133
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:34,062
See if he left his motherfucking keys
in the car.

134
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,074
This is fucked up.

135
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,876
No. No.

136
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,879
Jesus, you make a left
at the stop sign.

137
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,465
You must be looking at us.
What are you, Ray Charles?

138
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:03,675
Jesus Christ!

139
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,885
How could it not
have gone down?

140
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,096
I know, Junior. I'm sorry.

141
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:12,308
Some civilian got in the way.
Donnie will explain it to us.

142
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,018
I wanted it to be over.

143
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,520
I know.

144
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,438
Junior, mints?

145
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,242
We've been fucking
standing around here forever.

146
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,744
You don't think we got
better things to do?

147
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,830
What the fuck, man?

148
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,626
They'll do it tomorrow.
My personal guarantee.

149
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,337
Let me tell you something, Donnie.
If they don't...

150
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,757
...some hikers are gonna find your
personal guarantee rolled up...

151
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,426
...and shoved up your ass.

152
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:49,637
Mike, they got blocked in.
There were witnesses.

153
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,890
- Tomorrow.
- What did I just say?

154
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:55,351
I already talked to them.
I realize it's urgent.

155
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:58,104
I heard Tony's own mother
wants him popped.

156
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,356
Who the fuck told you that?

157
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,442
I don't know. It's just a joke.

158
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,736
You think that's funny,
a guy's own mother?

159
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:05,945
Okay, okay.

160
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,238
Tomorrow!

161
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,157
Fucking A!

162
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,492
All right.

163
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:25,048
I don't like it.
This fucking guy's big mouth.

164
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,717
- No, he's okay.
- I don't like it!

165
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,470
Next they'll be making jokes
about me.

166
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:36,059
Chucky! Tell him to wait a minute.

167
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,687
Yo, Donnie! Hold on a minute.

168
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,733
Hey, Donnie.

169
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,527
Sorry!

170
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,550
Are you still taking the lithium?

171
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:14,597
Lithium. Prozac.
When's it gonna end?

172
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,600
We're trying to give a jolt
to your system.

173
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,227
Give it...

174
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,437
...a little kick start.

175
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,398
Why not kick me in the head?

176
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:26,401
What you're going through is very
painful, I know that.

177
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,404
You get stabbed in the ribs,
that's painful.

178
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:32,740
This shit, I don't feel nothing.

179
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,826
Nothing.

180
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:38,579
Dead. Empty.

181
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,002
What else?

182
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,675
- What?
- What were you just thinking about?

183
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,595
This gorgeous piece of cooz...

184
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:58,891
...next door to Cusamano's. She's
staying there while they're away.

185
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,727
You do feel something?

186
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,772
Don't split hairs with me
because I've had it with you.

187
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:08,818
Like King Midas in reverse,
everything I touch turns to shit.

188
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:13,656
I'm not a husband to my wife.
I'm not a father to my kids.

189
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:17,160
I'm not a friend to my friends.
I'm nothing.

190
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,290
I don't even know why I come here.

191
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,252
Nothing else to do.

192
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:30,381
Do you think it would help if you went
someplace to rest up awhile?

193
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:33,384
- You mean like Vegas?
- No, not Vegas.

194
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,512
- A place where you'd be looked after.
- Like a hospital?

195
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:41,601
- With padded rooms and straitjackets?
- No. No straitjackets.

196
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,103
A residential treatment center.

197
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,647
Any idea what my life
would be worth...

198
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,650
...if people knew I was
in a laughing academy?

199
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,319
Your life is boxing us in.

200
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,821
I'll take a gun and blow my head off.

201
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:57,158
If that's what you're saying,
you should be hospitalized.

202
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,326
Oh, yeah?

203
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:01,788
You get a couple of guys,
come to my house, try it.

204
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:04,874
All right.

205
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:10,546
I'm gonna push the Prozac
to 60 milligrams.

206
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,632
Sure, why not?

207
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:28,064
Hey, is that you?

208
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,775
Ciao!

209
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,485
Look who's here.

210
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:35,029
I was just talking about you.
No kidding.

211
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,447
What are you doing here?

212
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:41,202
Have the class in gum grafting
alla scuola. I just finish.

213
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:45,790
Let me ask you. This sandwich,
it says it's a "hero."

214
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,459
Why do they call a sandwich "hero"?

215
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,212
- You don't want to eat that.
- No?

216
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,506
Come on.

217
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,633
- What's your name?
- Isabella.

218
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:58,094
I'm Tony.

219
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,638
- You never went in Italy.
- No.

220
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:03,641
Why no? You don't want to go?

221
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:07,436
I guess I just never got off my ass.
Excuse my French.

222
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:08,729
Your French?

223
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:10,940
It's an expression.

224
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:15,570
And where are your people from?

225
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,822
Wait a minute, don't tell me.

226
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,162
- Avellino?
- How'd you know that?

227
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,622
I didn't. I guessed it.

228
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,667
You look like this guy from there.

229
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:32,170
He came after the earthquake...

230
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,629
...to repair...

231
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:38,259
How do you say the seat
of the house?

232
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:39,969
I love how you say that.

233
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,388
"Hearthquake."

234
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:44,390
You are making a joke.

235
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,934
No. No, I'm sorry.

236
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:48,936
Go ahead.

237
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,481
Fondamenta. Do you understand?
Fondamenta?

238
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:53,816
Foundation.

239
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:57,778
Foundation, sì. Foundation was
cracked, and he repaired the stone.

240
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:02,241
My grandfather was a stonemason.
He was Avellinese, him and his brother.

241
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:06,329
You should visit Avellino if
your family come from there.

242
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:10,249
There isn't too much left
because of the many earthquake.

243
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:15,254
But from the 17th century, is
still there a beautiful palazzo.

244
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,256
Palazzo della Dogana.

245
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:21,636
And there is a place in
the corner of the piazza...

246
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:26,349
...a wine bar. You can sit.
You can see the hills.

247
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,267
And when is spring...

248
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:32,647
...you can smell the blossom
from the lemon trees.

249
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,274
And there is a church with a bell.

250
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:40,321
And they say when it rings,
that means that a baby...

251
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:44,867
...was conceived in the town.

252
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:03,511
Antonio.

253
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,528
Tony?

254
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,448
Tony?

255
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:29,495
- Are you on medication?
- No.

256
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,038
No.

257
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,961
Tell me more about your...

258
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,672
...dental studies.

259
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:44,677
I was interested mainly...

260
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:48,973
...in tumors of the gum
and the soft tissue of the mouth.

261
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,516
Yeah?

262
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:55,021
Tumors of the gum, huh? Wow.

263
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:57,189
Dad, we're eating!

264
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,404
Hold it, Ma. Anthony?

265
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:06,324
- What does a gentleman do?
- In his own house?

266
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:09,410
A girl's invited
Anthony to his first formal.

267
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,704
Well, then?

268
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,464
Okay?

269
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,216
Thank you, young man.

270
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,096
Okay.

271
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,432
Tony!

272
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:37,730
I told you your
mother was coming for dinner.

273
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:42,943
- Hi, Mom.
- Well, look who's decided to join us.

274
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:45,446
And with that breath!

275
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,368
You know, I really don't need
that right now, Ma.

276
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:52,244
Aren't we being sensitive!

277
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:56,082
Meadow, can you take some chicken
and pass it, please?

278
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:01,087
- Where's Uncle Jun?
- He said he wasn't feeling well.

279
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:05,508
Did you know the average
chicken's feet never touch the ground?

280
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:06,801
That's dicked up.

281
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,928
If I was that young lady...

282
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,389
...and you came and took me
to that dance...

283
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,474
...and used that kind of talk...

284
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,309
...I'd slap your face!

285
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:17,520
That's right, Ma. Thank you.

286
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,897
Well, the whole world's gone crazy.

287
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:24,735
Some woman in Pennsylvania shot her
children and set her house on fire.

288
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,070
Here we go.

289
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,657
How come my son's in a bathrobe?
Is he sick?

290
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,867
- He's fine.
- Dad, you're depressed.

291
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,327
Depressed?

292
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:38,249
My father came to this country with
seventeen cents in his pocket...

293
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,626
...and he never made a peep.
Ma?

294
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,962
What's he got to be depressed about?

295
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:45,840
Nobody threw him into
the glue factory...

296
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:48,926
...and sold his house out from
underneath him.

297
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,970
We agreed to sell your home.

298
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:53,180
I'm going back upstairs.

299
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:55,307
I was making a joke!

300
00:23:56,518 --> 00:24:00,062
I suppose it would be better if I
never opened my mouth.

301
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,606
How can it be a joke
if you're crying?

302
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,900
This is really the last time.

303
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:08,404
I am never coming back to this house.

304
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:24,462
What a day! With this wind, huh?

305
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,672
What you looking at?

306
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:28,424
Nothing.

307
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,102
Who's she?

308
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:44,815
Dental student, from Italy.

309
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:47,234
You know her?

310
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,738
We had lunch.

311
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,449
Lunch?

312
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:58,245
You fucking piece of shit.

313
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,999
Going to dinner with you is
a distant memory for me...

314
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,877
...but you have time to
take her to lunch?

315
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:11,175
You're sinking this whole family into
your misery with your complaining...

316
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:15,471
...while I spoon-feed you
and bathe you!

317
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:19,266
A half-inch of another woman's
thigh gets you out of bed?

318
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,602
What am I, a fucking idiot?

319
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:26,315
If I had an ounce of self-respect,
I would cut your dick off!

320
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:36,075
I was there last night for dinner.

321
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:37,952
I couldn't go.

322
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:39,954
Those poor freaking kids.

323
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:44,416
They barely have a father now. You
should see him at the dinner table.

324
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:47,962
- I don't want to know.
- In his bathrobe at 7 p.m.

325
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:50,756
Some bargain.
That's all anyone should pay.

326
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:54,969
My cousin, Cakey, after his lobotomy,
looked exactly like my son.

327
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:57,638
- Livia.
- Empty. A shell.

328
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:01,767
Better Cakey die than live like that.
That's what his mother used to say.

329
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:05,813
Don't talk about it anymore.
Don't talk about Tony. It's done.

330
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:32,256
Mr. Tony, Miss Carmela said to tell
you she went to buy a suit for A.J.

331
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,467
Go away.

332
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:40,014
Okay, mister. Miss Carmela told me to
remind you of your appointment.

333
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:14,798
How you doing, Tony?
Pick Six today?

334
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:18,552
No, just an orange juice
and a racing form today.

335
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,644
- This wind, huh?
- Yeah.

336
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:30,022
Here you go.

337
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,902
- Thanks. Take care.
- Okay.

338
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:12,022
Dead now, motherfucker!

339
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:18,779
Oh, shit!

340
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,474
Daddy! Where is he?
Please let him be all right!

341
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,727
- They didn't say anything?
- They didn't.

342
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:53,939
Look who's here.

343
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:57,276
Is he all right? Jesus Christ, Tony!

344
00:28:57,485 --> 00:29:00,404
Your ear's all bloody!
What'd they do to your ear?

345
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:03,490
I'm putting in stitches
to create a nice closure.

346
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:05,159
We were so scared.

347
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:07,035
They almost killed you
for a car!

348
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:10,247
Guess nobody told them about
the gas mileage it gets.

349
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:12,416
It's not funny, Dad.

350
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:16,795
What's the matter? Forget how
to talk because I got banged up?

351
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:19,673
- No.
- He's just frightened, that's all.

352
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:22,426
Doctor needs to
finish up here, ma'am.

353
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:25,554
All right. Let's give
the doctor some room.

354
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:28,056
See you later.

355
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,270
- Poor Dad.
- He'll be all right.

356
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,649
Christ!

357
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:42,571
You can't wait until they
finish sewing my ear back on?

358
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:46,867
One inch to the left and you're
in a drawer instead of talking to me.

359
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,577
Who's talking to you?

360
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:50,788
What's he doing here?

361
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,790
Agent Harris is just leaving.

362
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:55,334
We're offering your husband
full immunity...

363
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,544
...in return for his testimony.

364
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:01,465
Relocate you and your family,
you'll be completely safe.

365
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:02,841
Don't talk to my wife.

366
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,635
He wouldn't have to go to jail?

367
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:07,513
Carmela, ask this prick if
I'm even indicted.

368
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:10,682
This assassination problem is
not going to go away.

369
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:13,393
I told you to stop talking to my wife!

370
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,312
Carmela, will you wait outside?

371
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:16,563
Kiss my ass, Tony!

372
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:20,526
We're your only option, Tony.
It's not safe for you anymore.

373
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,821
- This conversation's over.
- What do you know?

374
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,906
He knows nothing.
It was a carjacking!

375
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:28,909
Now get out of here!
You're upsetting my wife!

376
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,953
In case you change your mind.

377
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,504
- You know he's right.
- Nothing will happen.

378
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:43,924
Wake up, Tony! It already did!

379
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,845
I took an oath, Carmela.

380
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,763
Are you a kid in a tree house?

381
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,099
Did you tell anybody about me
seeing Melfi?

382
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:55,769
That's why they tried to kill you,
because you see a psychiatrist?

383
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:58,522
It was a carjacking!

384
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:00,482
Have the decency not to lie to me.

385
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:03,861
What do you want to do, Carmela?
Move to Utah?

386
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,988
Be Mr. and Mrs. Mike Smith?

387
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:10,284
We could sell Indian relics.
Maybe start a rattlesnake ranch.

388
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:14,621
This is our chance to get out, Tony.
We could start a whole new life.

389
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:18,292
Have some Mormons over to dinner.
Eat some tomatoes with no taste.

390
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:20,794
I want those kids to have a father.

391
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,838
They got one. This one.

392
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:26,800
Me. Tony Soprano.
And all that comes with it.

393
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,302
Oh, you prick!

394
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,724
Good.

395
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:40,439
I can't go to that dance now either.

396
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:42,316
God, self-involved much?

397
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:50,490
- It's Uncle Silvio and Uncle Paulie.
- Hey, squirt!

398
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:53,952
- They shot my dad.
- He's all right, though, isn't he?

399
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:58,332
Take more than a Jamaican bobsled team
with cap guns to stop him.

400
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:00,167
- Where is he?
- With Mom.

401
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,627
All right.

402
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:11,428
They look kind of weird.

403
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:18,518
I don't believe it was a carjacking.

404
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,361
Today in Montclair, Anthony Soprano...

405
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:31,448
...who allegedly is a captain
in the northern New Jersey Mafia...

406
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:34,743
...was wounded in what he claims
was an attempted carjack.

407
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:39,539
But sources in the FBI say it was
a gangland execution gone awry.

408
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:43,043
Soprano escaped with minor wounds and
was taken to an undisclosed hospital.

409
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:48,131
One of his assailants,
William "Petite" Clayborn...

410
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:50,175
...was killed in the attack.

411
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,928
Continuing now with...

412
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,430
Is this true?

413
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:57,557
Do you think they made it up?

414
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:00,644
But how could this happen?

415
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:03,689
I don't know. I don't frigging know.

416
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:07,734
I feel like I'm floating in space.
He'll look for who did this.

417
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:09,861
Anthony? Of course he is!

418
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:14,700
- You understand what's going on?
- My son got shot and he got away!

419
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:18,620
What do we do now?
What the fuck do we do now, Livia?

420
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,414
- We go see him.
- Tony?

421
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:22,416
Of course!

422
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:25,502
He's my only son.

423
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,631
Thanks, sweetheart.

424
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:32,759
- We could use some peppers out here.
- I'll get them.

425
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:34,636
Don't you have homework to do?

426
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:36,763
I can't help too?

427
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:39,266
Some fucking shit, huh?

428
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:42,811
Tony! Jesus fucking Christ!

429
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:46,148
Who do we blame for the hat?

430
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:48,108
I was on Denny Najarian's boat.

431
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:51,570
Two shooters, and his piece
was under the seat.

432
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:55,115
- You believe it?
- Two girls from the 'hood, that's all.

433
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:59,369
- Do we know who they are?
- The live one took off in a Taurus.

434
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,247
- Taurus?
- Yeah.

435
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:06,293
Moolies in a new Taurus.
Doesn't exactly fit the profile.

436
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:11,048
Motherfuck! These guys I had
a beef with at the newsstand.

437
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:13,800
- You were there?
- The day before yesterday.

438
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,511
The newsstand? The one in Montclair?

439
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,306
Yeah, I was in the neighborhood.

440
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,974
What were you doing there?

441
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,268
Taking my mother to the doctor.

442
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,273
Hey, put it right there, baby.

443
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:30,108
Thank you.

444
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:35,322
This husband of yours, Carmela.
How much we love him.

445
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:37,824
- He's the best.
- Come on.

446
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:39,659
He's like a father to me.

447
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:43,080
Just make sure nothing happens to him.

448
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,502
I'll get it.

449
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:51,630
Come on.

450
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,758
All due respect, Tone...

451
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:57,219
...it had to be your uncle, right?

452
00:34:58,012 --> 00:35:00,138
Well, why fucking now?

453
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,182
Maybe he found out.

454
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:03,850
Found out what?

455
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:09,064
That he's Joe Jerk-off, not the boss.
That you run things behind his back.

456
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:10,315
Anthony!

457
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:12,692
Uncle Jun!

458
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:15,237
Don't get up. I heard your knee
was fucked up.

459
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,823
Don't worry, I'm all right.

460
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:20,200
- Your ear's disfigured.
- It's all right.

461
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:22,035
Hi.

462
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:27,374
Mikey and my crew are cracking
heads to find out who did this.

463
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:31,336
When we're done with them they're
gonna wish they were never born.

464
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:34,381
Look who it is. Father Intintola!

465
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,134
I came as a friend.

466
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:39,136
- How are you, Tony?
- All right.

467
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:44,349
If you'd like to speak privately
we could kneel in prayer or...

468
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:45,892
Not right now.

469
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:49,646
Why don't you grab a sandwich
and we'll talk later.

470
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:52,732
- You're sleeping over, right?
- Can I get you anything?

471
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:54,651
- Another sambuca?
- I'll get it.

472
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:58,155
I'll take a curaçao, if you got it.
I'll buy him one too.

473
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,740
No, that's all right.
No alcohol for me.

474
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,701
Can he hear through that ear?

475
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:07,247
Ma, sit down. Here you go.
Have something to eat.

476
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,086
Want some?

477
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:15,213
Fuck, I thought it was him.

478
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:17,883
But there he is, glasses and all.

479
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:23,096
Don't eat capocollo, Grandma.
It's all fat.

480
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:25,307
Capocollo? Over here!

481
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,311
Right there.

482
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:31,062
Who is that?

483
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,439
Who?

484
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,066
- That girl.
- Who, Meadow?

485
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:39,237
- Is that Concetta?
- It's your granddaughter. Meadow?

486
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:42,741
All right, don't get impatient.
I'm your mother!

487
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:46,953
Did you hear? Dad fought off
two black guys. One got shot.

488
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:49,497
Why aren't you dressed for the dance?

489
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,499
- I can't go.
- Why not?

490
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:52,959
Don't you need me here?

491
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:55,837
And disappoint the future
Miss New Jersey?

492
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:58,089
Mom was gonna drive.
She can't now.

493
00:36:58,299 --> 00:36:59,841
You're gonna go.

494
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:54,229
I gotta know something.

495
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,357
And I want the truth.

496
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:03,780
Did you ever tell anybody
about you and me?

497
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:08,201
I may have mentioned
to my family...

498
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:11,746
...that I had a patient who was
in trouble with something...

499
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,207
...we were hearing about in the news.

500
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:18,878
I never mentioned a name
or any other specifics...

501
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:22,215
...that could identify you
as that person.

502
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,813
My son's.

503
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:42,902
Does your family know?

504
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:49,534
My mother's made a few comments.
But I don't see how she knows.

505
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,202
And even if she did...

506
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:58,752
Don't even go there about
the old lady.

507
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:04,966
You should've seen her at my house.
She was losing her mind.

508
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:10,347
How are you doing with all of this?

509
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,019
I feel pretty good.

510
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,687
- Really?
- Yeah.

511
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:19,481
Well, that's good.

512
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,025
Talk about a jolt to the system.

513
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:23,485
Try getting shot at.

514
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:26,196
It'll give you a nice kick start.

515
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:35,163
You know, when I was depressed...

516
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:38,500
...I said I didn't want to live.

517
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:43,922
Well, I tell you something.

518
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,258
I didn't want to die.

519
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:51,596
Every fucking particle of my being
was fighting to live.

520
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,813
I had lunch with that girl next door.

521
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,272
You did?

522
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:03,108
Isabella.

523
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:07,695
She was telling me about...

524
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:11,741
...Avellino, where my people are from.

525
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,868
It sounded nice.

526
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:17,163
Anyway, she was talking...

527
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,499
...and then all of a sudden...

528
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:27,882
...we went to another place, like...

529
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,093
...in my mind's eye.

530
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:34,889
I don't know, we went back in time
to, like, 1907 or something.

531
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:39,686
And we were in this room, me and her.

532
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:46,526
And she was holding a baby on her
breast. She was nursing it.

533
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:50,113
She was whispering to it, like,
"It's okay, little baby.

534
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:52,866
Don't cry. It's gonna be okay.

535
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,701
I love you."

536
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,372
Did the baby have a name?

537
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,708
She was calling it Antonio.

538
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:06,504
Anthony, your fantasy...

539
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:09,215
...that's you, that little baby.

540
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:12,343
And Isabella, that she was
nursing you.

541
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:23,688
Fuck me.

542
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:05,271
You think this is a stretch?

543
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:23,248
Can we get some of that whiskey?

544
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:30,880
Livia.

545
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,967
You don't knock?
I could've been in the nude!

546
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,552
What the hell is going on?

547
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:38,888
- See if my slipper is over there.
- Fuck your slipper!

548
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:41,432
I don't like that talk!

549
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:43,518
What was that bullshit yesterday?

550
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:46,563
You don't even recognize
your granddaughter?

551
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:53,278
I've been forgetting things lately.

552
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:57,657
You'll find that it'll happen
to you soon too.

553
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:01,911
Terrific timing, after the
move on your son is in the toilet!

554
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:04,622
I don't know
what you're talking about!

555
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:19,012
Hey, Cuse!

556
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:20,638
Cuse!

557
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:24,017
How was Bermuda?

558
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:27,103
Jeanie wrecked up a motorbike.
Hurt her ankle bad.

559
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,314
- Oh, yeah? I'm sorry.
- Thanks.

560
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:32,150
So where's your dental student?

561
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:34,485
My what?

562
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:37,113
Isabella. Haven't seen her
in a couple days.

563
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:41,826
Your houseguest, Isabella.
Dark hair, beautiful.

564
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,830
You don't know what I'm saying?

565
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:49,042
Tony, I got no idea
what you're saying.

566
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:53,171
You didn't have an Italian girl?
She's here studying?

567
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:56,966
We had Skippy Palumbo from down
the street take care of the dog.

568
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:01,054
Never mind.

569
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:03,598
Forget it. Joke.

570
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:07,060
- I'll talk to you later.
- All right.

571
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:17,779
You sure about this? You're not
pulling my leg?

572
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:21,240
What am I, an idiot?
Of course I'm sure!

573
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,785
- You never...?
- No!

574
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:29,207
I think I've said enough about it.
I never threatened to cut your dick off.

575
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:43,680
- Hello?
- Yeah, it's your patient.

576
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:46,599
The one who's been involved
in the news lately?

577
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:48,685
- I gotta talk to you.
- What's wrong?

578
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:51,938
- There was no Isabella.
- What?

579
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:56,234
There was no Isabella.
I just talked to Cusamano...

580
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:58,778
...he just got back from Bermuda.

581
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:03,282
I asked, "Where's the dental student?"
He looked at me like I was pazzo.

582
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:06,869
But you said that your wife saw her,
that you argued about it.

583
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:08,996
Yeah, I asked her about that.

584
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:11,165
- And?
- You thought she was pissed then?

585
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:15,044
You should see her now that I said
it was a fantasy.

586
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,505
Discontinue the lithium.

587
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:19,006
I already flushed it.

588
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:23,511
Even if it was the medicine,
this fantasy of yours has meaning.

589
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:28,516
You know, the issue of mother
and child. The Madonna.

590
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:30,643
You didn't see this broad.

591
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:34,313
Did you ever flirt or come on
sexually with Isabella?

592
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:35,982
- No.
- Why not?

593
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:39,318
You said she was very
beautiful and voluptuous.

594
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:40,611
Another question:

595
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:41,904
Why now?

596
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:44,073
- What?
- Why the need...

597
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,993
...for the fantasy of
a loving woman now?

598
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,664
- I don't know.
- Come in.

599
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:53,332
We can talk face to face.

600
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:55,042
I can't right now.

601
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:59,213
Your mother is always
talking about infanticide.

602
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,424
It's a sad situation in the world.

603
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:05,344
- Do you still feel okay?
- I feel pretty good, actually.

604
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:09,766
When I find out who shot at me,
I'll feel even better.
