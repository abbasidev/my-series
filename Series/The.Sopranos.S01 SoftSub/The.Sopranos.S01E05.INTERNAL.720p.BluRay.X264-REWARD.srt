1
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,531
How'd it go?

2
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,951
They've got a 48 to 52 male/female
ratio, which is great.

3
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,663
A strong liberal arts program
and the Olin Arts Center for music.

4
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:05,165
The usual programs abroad
are China, India...

5
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,668
You're just applying.
Already you're leaving?

6
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:10,504
It's an option, Dad. Junior year.

7
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:14,216
What'll you study in India?
How not to get diarrhea?

8
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:18,053
They don't require SAT scores,
but mine are high.

9
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,763
Socially, I don't know.

10
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,682
I heard there's a saying:

11
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:25,477
"Bates is the world's most expensive
form of contraception."

12
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:27,312
What kind of talk is that?

13
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,898
The girls at the other
colleges put out?

14
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:31,483
Oh, my God.

15
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,738
It's pretty, huh?

16
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,866
Yeah.

17
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,952
Two to go. Colby up.

18
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,999
Dad, how come you
didn't finish college?

19
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,501
I had a semester and a half
at Seton Hall.

20
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:51,503
Yeah, and?

21
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:54,923
My parents
didn't stress college.

22
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,092
They were working-class people.

23
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,595
How come they were
anti-education?

24
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:02,014
They weren't "anti."

25
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,933
You can't lay it all off on them.

26
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,686
I got into trouble
when I was a kid.

27
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:09,813
- I heard.
- You did?

28
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,482
In Waterville,
dine at the Stone House.

29
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:15,319
Serving the freshest
Maine lobsters.

30
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:18,780
Come see our new salad bar,
featuring a wonderful...

31
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,543
Are you in the Mafia?

32
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:35,088
Am I in the what?

33
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,507
Whatever, organized crime?

34
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,304
That's crap. Who told you that?

35
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,473
I've lived in the house
all my life.

36
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,768
I've seen police come,
I've seen you go out at 3 a.m.

37
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:51,396
You never seen Doc Cusamano
go out at 3 a.m. on a call?

38
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:54,149
The Cusamano kids
ever find $50,000...

39
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,069
...and a.45 while hunting
for Easter eggs?

40
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,073
In the waste management business,
everybody assumes you're mobbed up.

41
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,992
It's a stereotype, and it's offensive.

42
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:06,328
You're the last person I want
to perpetuate it.

43
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:07,996
Fine.

44
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,834
There is no Mafia.

45
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,303
All right, look...

46
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,348
...Med, you're a grown woman.

47
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,058
Almost.

48
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,353
Some of my money...

49
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,357
...comes from illegal gambling
and whatnot.

50
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,490
How does that make you feel?

51
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:47,494
At least you don't keep
denying it like Mom.

52
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,163
Kids in school think it's neat.

53
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:51,957
Seen The Godfather, right?

54
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,711
Casino we like. Sharon Stone,
'70s clothes, pills.

55
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:59,131
I'm not asking about those bums.
I'm asking about you.

56
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,009
Sometimes I wish you were
like other dads.

57
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:05,721
But then like, Mr. Scangarelo,
for example.

58
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:10,225
An advertising executive
for big tobacco. Or lawyers? Ugh.

59
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,853
- So many dads are full of shit.
- I'm not?

60
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,731
You finally told the truth about this.

61
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,906
Look, Med, part of my income
comes from legitimate businesses.

62
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,366
The stock market...

63
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:30,537
Look, Dad, please.
Don't start mealy-mouthing.

64
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,087
How's my sweetheart?

65
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,090
I'm so pissed, I can hardly see.

66
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,592
You getting the flu?

67
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:46,094
No. That's my cousin, Svetlana.

68
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:47,262
The amputee?

69
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:51,391
Two months she's only in America,
and she's already getting married.

70
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:55,103
You knew the deal. I got two kids.
We talked about this.

71
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:59,941
Yes, and a wife whenever you want.
What do I have in my life?

72
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,485
Am I glad I called.

73
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:04,112
Fuck you, then! Hang up!

74
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,323
How are the whirlpool jets?

75
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:09,451
Don't throw up in my face
things you buy me.

76
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:13,455
Her prosthetic leg fell off
in a Gap store...

77
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:17,000
...and he carries her
out like a knight...

78
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,252
...in a white satin armor.

79
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,631
I gotta go, my daughter's coming.

80
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,510
Jesus!

81
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,061
How you feeling?

82
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:40,982
Better, actually. Fever just broke.
I miss you two.

83
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,528
- How's the interviews going?
- Good, real good.

84
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:45,987
Did she like Bates?

85
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:50,242
Anything to get her
off of this Berkeley kick.

86
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,036
What the fuck?

87
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,664
Tony?

88
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,541
Yeah. Yeah.

89
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,043
Look, I'll call you from the motel.

90
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,185
Meadow! Come on!

91
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:29,906
- Come on, get in.
- Okay, okay, what's the rush?

92
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,910
Jesus, Dad!

93
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,460
What's going on?

94
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,337
I think I saw an old friend.

95
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,465
You know that guy?

96
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:49,259
Maybe not. Probably not.

97
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,094
Then what?

98
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:53,889
Dad, slow down!

99
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,229
- Jesus, what's with you?!
- It's all right.

100
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,315
Fucking maniac!

101
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:06,902
- What's going on?
- Just fooling around.

102
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,242
Colby! Turn!

103
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,328
Colby! Turn left, it's left!

104
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:20,332
Dad!

105
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,251
That's because you're talking.

106
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,761
This gets us to Colby anyhow.

107
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,433
Dad, that's our motel.

108
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,561
Our motel's right there.

109
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:50,028
- Did you know that guy?
- It wasn't him.

110
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,458
Bada-bing.

111
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,126
Take this number down.

112
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,670
Now? It's pouring.

113
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,881
207-555-0185.

114
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:17,472
Bonjour. Room service est arrivé.

115
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,396
Why, thank you, kind sir.

116
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,903
What? You said poached eggs.

117
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,907
You're not eating,
after all that work?

118
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,743
My eyes were bigger than my stomach.

119
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,671
Why don't you go over to Jason's,
play Nintendo.

120
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:55,051
Nope, no kisses. Cooties.

121
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,720
I'll be back in an hour.

122
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,346
Okay.

123
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,029
Oh, motherfucker.

124
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,741
Motherfucking shit.

125
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,456
I'm not sure, but I think
I saw Fabian Petrulio.

126
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,958
- Refresh my memory.
- Before your time?

127
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:30,754
Made guy, flipped 10 years ago.
He got busted for peddling H.

128
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,589
Took out a lot of people.

129
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,466
People from our outfit.

130
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,761
My old man was sick. He never
recovered when he heard.

131
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,346
You saw this guy?

132
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,973
I'm saying I think I did,
but I'm not sure.

133
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,059
Up in Maine? What the fuck?

134
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,978
He was in the witness-protection
program. Then they kicked him out.

135
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,481
He goes to colleges and gets paid...

136
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,775
...to talk about what
a big Mafioso he was.

137
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,068
Piece of shit.

138
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:56,071
We partied, but Jackie Aprile
knew him good.

139
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,323
They did time in Lewisburg.

140
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:01,534
You know that bust
in his rec room with Sinatra?

141
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,745
Febbie made it
in a prison workshop.

142
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,749
That was Frank? I always
thought it was Shaquille.

143
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,043
Fucker needs to practice on lips.

144
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:13,088
I know. Anyway, run these
plates for me.

145
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:15,757
Go ahead.

146
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:20,762
"Maine, DX66920," call you back
tonight at 10, all right?

147
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:26,559
What's wrong with the phone
in your room?

148
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:31,106
Nothing. Just taking a walk, saw it,
figured I'd call Christopher.

149
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,565
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

150
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,067
Everything okay?

151
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,778
They got a leak in the roof,
all right?

152
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:45,161
- Who is it?
- Father Phil.

153
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:49,457
Just a second. Oh, Jesus.

154
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:17,777
- Oh, my God. Look at you!
- I hope I'm not barging in.

155
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,280
No. I was watching TV.

156
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:23,867
I was at the clothing drive.
I thought you were in Maine.

157
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:27,746
Your Moschino peddle-pusher
suit, it flew out of there.

158
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,873
Good, good, good!

159
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,542
Anyway, Jean Cusamano
said you were ill.

160
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,378
Yes, I was.
The flu that was going around.

161
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:39,174
- Yipes!
- Yeah, I still have a little fever.

162
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:42,552
I also have a confession to make, Carm.

163
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:49,768
I have a jones for your baked ziti.

164
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:53,271
I have some in the freezer.
I can reheat it.

165
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:55,523
It's so much better that way.

166
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:58,902
- The mozzarella gets nice and chewy.
- I like that.

167
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:02,197
I was having some Fernet.
Would you like something?

168
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,073
Some wine, if it's open.

169
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,535
So how's Med and Tony's trip going?

170
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:12,248
I should know? He doesn't have time
to talk to me for two minutes.

171
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,632
Stop staring.
Why are you doing that?

172
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,092
It's an exciting time.

173
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,887
I can't tell you how proud I am.

174
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,765
A real student at Casa Soprano.

175
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:32,352
And she looks like a model
out of Italian Vogue.

176
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:35,230
Italian, Italian, Italian.
Thank you.

177
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,067
You're up to something.

178
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,445
How'd you get so cynical?

179
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:51,496
That stuff we talked about.
How's that sitting with you?

180
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,249
Not like I wasn't 90% sure already.

181
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,960
What about your brother?
Does he know?

182
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,795
I think so.

183
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:03,758
There was a time when Italian people
didn't have a lot of options.

184
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,845
You mean like Mario Cuomo?

185
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:08,930
Sorry.

186
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,768
I put food on the table.

187
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:17,105
My father was in it,
my uncle was in it.

188
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:20,275
Maybe I was too lazy
to think for myself.

189
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,945
Considered myself a rebel.

190
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:28,116
Being a rebel in my family would
have been selling patio furniture.

191
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:33,121
In college, nothing interested you?

192
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,665
I barely got in.

193
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,294
Well, I kind of liked history.

194
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,670
Yeah?

195
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,965
Napoleon, The Roman Empire.

196
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,301
The Potsdam Conference,
that stuff.

197
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,844
The Potsdam Conference?

198
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,890
- Potsdamned if I know now.
- Oh, my God.

199
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,188
I have something to tell you.

200
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:01,900
Yeah?

201
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:05,945
You're not?

202
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,822
No. Jesus.

203
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:16,623
A couple of weeks ago, me and some
friends, we were doing speed.

204
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:19,334
- We did a lot for a while.
- You what?

205
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:24,839
It was just between homework and SATs
and the general pressure of life...

206
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,299
We needed something.

207
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,551
- That crap'll kill you!
- I know.

208
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:31,304
I ought to slap you.
Where'd you get it?

209
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,973
If I knew I'd get a lecture,
I wouldn't have told.

210
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:37,769
Reality check! What do you think
I'd say? Where did you get it?

211
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,939
I'm not telling.
Especially after this reaction.

212
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,649
Why did you tell me?

213
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,945
You were honest with me today.

214
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:49,322
I won't do it again.
It got too scary.

215
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:52,951
Jesus, right under my nose.

216
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:54,786
You'd think you'd know.

217
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,081
No, Dad. You won't.

218
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:08,299
Well, I'm glad you told me.
In spite of everything.

219
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:12,720
I'm glad too. I'm glad we have
that kind of relationship.

220
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,147
Tony hates building fires.

221
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,568
We have this beautiful fireplace
with logs from when Lincoln split them.

222
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,905
Fear of fire is good
to keep out of hell.

223
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,409
Well, maybe there is hope for him.

224
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:39,455
I got something for you.
It's what we were talking about.

225
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,916
The chapter on Buddhism
is spectacular.

226
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,460
But I don't want you
going over to them.

227
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:48,923
Fat chance. I could never just
sit on the floor and think of nothing.

228
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,092
- Thank you.
- Sure.

229
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:56,514
You'll see how Islam has gotten
a bad rap in current culture...

230
00:16:56,932 --> 00:17:00,476
Boy, this Chianti, though,
is beyond reproach.

231
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,270
Word up.

232
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,776
- Dad.
- I thought you fell in.

233
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,114
This is Carrie and Lucinda.

234
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:15,116
They go to Colby.

235
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,118
Why not hang out with them?

236
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,619
Dad.

237
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,955
What better way to
learn about the college?

238
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,291
Yeah, maybe.

239
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,126
No, that'd be cool.

240
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,627
Please excuse him.

241
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,422
No, really, we love
to dish the school.

242
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,134
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

243
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:36,679
No drinking. Girls, you see
that she sticks to Cokes.

244
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:40,308
I'll come back in an hour and a half.
Be good.

245
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,151
- What have you got?
- Wet shoes.

246
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,321
Don't want to work in the rain,
try out for the Yankees.

247
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,907
The car is registered
to Fredrick Peters...

248
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,951
...38 Washington Street,
Waterville, Maine.

249
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,329
It's off Route 201.
I looked it up.

250
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:06,000
Fredrick Peters, Fabian Petrulio.
Good match, huh?

251
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,837
I guess, I don't know.
T, what are you going to do?

252
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:13,800
I don't know. I got Meadow here.

253
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,301
Jesus.

254
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,096
If you want, I'll fly up
and take care of it.

255
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,306
Ah, you're a good kid.

256
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,892
You stay put.
Call Pussy or Paulie.

257
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,686
- They can but I can't?
- Don't be sensitive.

258
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:28,147
They had a friend die in prison
due to him.

259
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,649
I'll let them know.

260
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:32,902
I gotta do my homework
and positively I.D. this guy.

261
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,612
I thought it was him.

262
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,906
I haven't seen him in 12 years.

263
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,660
I'll call you around midnight.
Sit tight.

264
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,836
You think I'm a schnorrer?

265
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:51,504
A who?

266
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:56,467
Yiddish. Means somebody who always
shows up in time for free grub.

267
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,761
No, you're here a lot.

268
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:01,430
But you're a man, you like to eat.

269
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,726
I can't get over you
with that Yiddish.

270
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:10,815
My neighborhood in Yonkers was mixed
Jewish and Italian, you know?

271
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,067
A heady brew.

272
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,819
What does that mean, "heady"?

273
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:19,031
You know, melting pot. Vigor.

274
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,038
Hello.

275
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,832
I'm calling for Tony Soprano.

276
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,500
Cajun stuffed olives?

277
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:31,043
Who can I say is calling?

278
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,670
This is Dr. Melfi.

279
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,088
His nurse?

280
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:37,133
No, is this Mrs. Soprano?

281
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,343
That's right, and you are?

282
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,512
Jennifer Melfi. Dr. Melfi?

283
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:44,098
Jennifer, lovely name.

284
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:46,517
He's not home.

285
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:49,937
Could I impose on you to tell him...

286
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:54,275
...I need to reschedule Monday's
appointment? I'm down with the flu.

287
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:55,860
Does he have your number?

288
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:57,737
Let me give it to you.

289
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:00,448
I lost my pencil, up his ass.

290
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,366
I'll tell him you called.

291
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,543
Why does he have to lie?

292
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:16,339
Why couldn't he tell me
his therapist is a woman?

293
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,550
Maybe he did tell you,
and you didn't hear him.

294
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:23,471
Why wouldn't he tell me,
unless he's screwing her?

295
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:25,890
Carmela, please.

296
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,517
I thought he was changing.

297
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:33,314
I thought therapy would help clear up
the fucking freak show in his head.

298
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:36,192
I'm sure you're wrong
about them.

299
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:39,070
Therapy is a start.
It's a good start.

300
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:42,490
But, yes, it doesn't fix the soul.

301
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:45,868
He'll need help
from other sources to repair that.

302
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:48,496
Then you talk to him!
You help him!

303
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:50,790
But, well, there you go.

304
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,917
I mean, will he listen?

305
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,505
He must be a very unhappy man.

306
00:20:57,714 --> 00:21:02,260
He's unhappy?!
Sleep is my number one... Ah, shit!

307
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,554
Why go into it?

308
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:30,871
- Mommy!
- Yes, bear?

309
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,291
Would you put me to bed? I'm scared.

310
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,126
Sure, honey, hold on.

311
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:38,546
- I thought she was sleeping.
- Well, she woke up.

312
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:41,799
Daddy's gonna come too.
We'll both put you to bed.

313
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,801
- Hurry, Daddy.
- Yeah, yeah.

314
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:22,048
These red pepper flakes
make all the difference.

315
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:23,758
Spicy.

316
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:29,096
As good as Willem Dafoe was, I cannot
picture that Jesus looked like him.

317
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,182
Could you pass the cheese?

318
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,934
Not that he didn't do well...

319
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:35,978
...but the story's confusing.

320
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,689
He gets down off the cross?

321
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:43,444
Originally, Bobby D.
was to have that role.

322
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:44,945
Really?

323
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,114
Different picture.

324
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:49,158
Oh, totally.

325
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,703
"You talking to me, Pilate?

326
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:56,207
You must be talking to me.
I don't see nobody else here...

327
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,959
...except Barabbas, here."

328
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,212
You know what's remarkable?

329
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:04,340
If you take everything Jesus
ever said, add it up...

330
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,634
...it amounts
to two hours of talk.

331
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,052
No!

332
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:10,805
I heard the same thing
about the Beatles.

333
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:14,642
Except if you add up all their
songs, it comes to 10 hours.

334
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:19,772
Yes.

335
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:25,277
It wasn't just what Christ said,
it was his deeds.

336
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,863
See, that's my question.

337
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:31,784
I understand what he did, but a lot
of what he said, I don't get.

338
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:37,039
Like, "The sun rises on the just
and the unjust alike?" Why?

339
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,834
Because, Christ was saying
that we're all...

340
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,670
Whores will go to Heaven
before the righteous?

341
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:44,880
That's not right.

342
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:48,092
Father, we got
some major contradictions here.

343
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:52,680
It's about love.
See it that way.

344
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,515
What does that mean?

345
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:56,475
It means...

346
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:00,688
...hopefully someday
we will learn to tolerate...

347
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:04,066
...accept and forgive
those that are different.

348
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,905
Change through love.

349
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:20,040
Well.

350
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,252
I better get going.

351
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,129
Where you going?
You just got here.

352
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:26,881
It's getting late.

353
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,133
Well, it's pouring rain out.

354
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:32,761
I know you love the DVD player.
I got Remains of the Day.

355
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:36,974
See, do I know you?

356
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,477
Anything with Emma Thompson.

357
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:41,645
I didn't know you looked.

358
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,147
What?

359
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,859
To take in through the eyes
a beautiful woman...

360
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:51,947
...is that different than a sunset?
A Douglas fir?

361
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,492
Or any of God's handiwork?

362
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:47,795
- Hey, Fred.
- Tanky, what do you say?

363
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,172
You gonna give away
homemade cheese this year?

364
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:52,883
For what they get for cream,
I don't know.

365
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:57,263
Tank, anybody been looking for me
or asking any questions about me?

366
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:59,139
Big guy, New York sounding?

367
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:00,891
Is there a problem?

368
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:06,313
No. Dipshit hit me with his boat
while I was tubing on Caribou Lake.

369
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,232
Claims it was my fault.

370
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:11,068
If he shows up,
do you want me to call?

371
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:14,071
Yeah, I wouldn't mind.
Do that, thanks.

372
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:20,137
No one's asking for you, Fred.

373
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,264
All right, Vitus. Thanks.

374
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:08,227
Hello, rat.

375
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,016
Please leave me alone.

376
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,644
Why won't you show me your book?

377
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:53,313
This is my private time.
You're invading it.

378
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,149
Oh, is that so?

379
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:58,318
- I'm invading your private time?
- Yes.

380
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:03,323
What's in that book?
Come on, let me see.

381
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:07,703
Or are you protecting me,
is that what you're doing?

382
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:10,414
Would I be shocked?

383
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,168
Would it ruin my character?

384
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,006
Let me see it.

385
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,738
Father, turn it off.
I can't handle it.

386
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:46,116
What? What is it?

387
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:48,952
Oh, Father, I'm a terrible person.

388
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:54,208
Oh, no. You're a wonderful woman.

389
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:57,669
It's been building in me.
I need to get it out.

390
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,630
There's so much in me, I...

391
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:05,260
- I want to...
- Carmela, if I can help, please.

392
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:10,265
How?

393
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:18,690
How long since you last confessed?

394
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,862
I, uh...

395
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,948
If you'd like, I can do this.

396
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,494
You mean here? Now?

397
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:35,707
The whole world is God's house.
He hears and sees everything.

398
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:04,444
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

399
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:09,533
It has been four weeks since my last
confession... What am I talking about?

400
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,243
That's a lie.

401
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:15,289
I haven't truly confessed
in 20 years.

402
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,085
Go on.

403
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,963
I have forsaken...

404
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:29,094
...what is right for what is easy.

405
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:36,518
Allowing what I know is evil
in my house.

406
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,397
Allowing my children...

407
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:44,276
...oh, my God, my sweet children,
to be a part of it.

408
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:47,070
Because I wanted things for them.

409
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:50,699
Wanted a better life. Good schools.

410
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:53,201
I wanted this house.

411
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:58,206
I wanted money in my hands,
money to buy anything I ever wanted.

412
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:00,167
I'm so ashamed.

413
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,844
My husband...

414
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:15,849
I think he has committed
horrible acts.

415
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:21,355
I think he has...
You know all about him, Father Phil.

416
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:24,691
I've said nothing.
I've done nothing about it.

417
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:29,446
I got a bad feeling.

418
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:34,242
It's a matter of time
before God compensates me...

419
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,536
...with outrage for my sins.

420
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:55,514
All right, come on.

421
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,519
Oh, tequila breath.

422
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:01,728
Sorry, Dad.

423
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:04,231
It's all right.
Just hang on to me.

424
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:07,734
Throw up on that dress,
I'll have to tell Mom.

425
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:11,697
This guy was giving me
tequila shooters.

426
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:18,370
Oh, God, everything is spinning.

427
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:21,623
- You're not mad, are you?
- A little bit.

428
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:24,084
- Where are the keys?
- I gave them to you.

429
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,669
Supposed to be.

430
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,588
- I love you, Dad.
- I know.

431
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:41,560
You must truly repent.

432
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:44,646
Genuinely and honestly.

433
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:51,111
In the future you must renounce these
actions, and God will absolve you.

434
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:57,117
I don't know, Father.
I'll try.

435
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:01,121
But I still love him.

436
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:04,791
I believe he can be a good man.

437
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:08,420
Then you help change him
into a better man.

438
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:11,048
Then you will have done good
in God's eyes.

439
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,262
You should take Communion.

440
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,515
Yeah.

441
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:36,907
Why do you have that?

442
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:41,912
Unfortunately I had to say Mass
for someone in intensive care.

443
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:50,837
Lord, I am not worthy to receive Thee.

444
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:55,675
- But just say the word...
- And I will be healed.

445
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:19,825
This is the body of Christ.
It was broken for you.

446
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:35,549
This is the blood of Christ.

447
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,385
It was shed for you.

448
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:04,744
Accept the spirit of Christ,
our Lord and Savior.

449
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,247
Amen.

450
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:12,085
In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

451
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,148
Dad?

452
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:37,527
I booked a seat on a Boston
flight. Tomorrow, 4:00.

453
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,363
- Best I could get.
- Don't come.

454
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:43,325
I'll make sure you're gone
before it happens.

455
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,952
- We won't ever meet.
- This is my thing.

456
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:50,373
I am your soldier. This is my duty
like we're always talking about.

457
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,459
The way this went down...

458
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:55,879
...this is my call.
I'll vouch for this myself.

459
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:59,299
Clipping a rat puts me
a cunt-hair away from being made.

460
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,802
He might've recognized me
at the gas station. He could lam.

461
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,850
You stay put.
End of discussion.

462
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:13,146
Why are you using the pay phone?

463
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,315
These walls are like paper.

464
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,068
- Please don't lie to me.
- Go back to bed.

465
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:20,737
Lying down made me throw up.

466
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:52,686
Hello.

467
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,938
Oh, hi, honey.

468
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:58,692
Oh, yeah. Was it fun?

469
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:01,778
Oh, good.

470
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:07,826
You want to sleep over there?

471
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,707
Okay. Love you.

472
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,481
That was A.J.

473
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:43,069
- He's sleeping over.
- I see.

474
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:50,368
- At a friend's house.
- Oh.

475
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:56,583
The Pucillos. I don't know
if you know them.

476
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,336
No.

477
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,089
Oh.

478
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:06,634
Oh.

479
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:08,720
- I...
- What?

480
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:11,765
Are you all right?

481
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,903
Father Phil?

482
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:26,988
Are you all right?

483
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:52,847
Hello?

484
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:55,225
Hello?

485
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:36,015
Ow! Don't!

486
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:39,727
You want to stop and get a beer?

487
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,575
You need this thing?

488
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:31,738
I'll pick you up in a little while.
Knock 'em dead.

489
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:35,116
- Aren't you coming in?
- I left my watch at the motel.

490
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:37,410
I'll catch up to you later.

491
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:40,288
Grab me a student paper.

492
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:29,712
You should have some coffee.

493
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,843
- Last night...
- Yeah.

494
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:39,973
We didn't do anything out of line.

495
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:42,600
There's nothing to apologize about.

496
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,563
- Right.
- That's right.

497
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:52,860
I should get dressed. Get going.

498
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,154
Anthony Jr. will be home soon.

499
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:59,409
Oh, my God. My car's been out there
all night in plain sight.

500
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:02,078
We didn't do anything wrong.

501
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:05,081
Is there a commandment
against eating ziti?

502
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,876
Take a shower, get dressed.

503
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:12,338
Don't forget your
sacrament kit, whatever.

504
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:17,343
I'm home!

505
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:23,016
Carmela.

506
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:27,186
I don't know where to begin.

507
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:35,528
It's not that I don't have desire
for you in my heart.

508
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:37,238
Madonna, Father, please.

509
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:41,367
Last night was one of the most
difficult tests from God ever.

510
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:44,078
What are you talking about?
We're friends.

511
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:49,042
- What's that look?
- What, I look some way?

512
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:58,259
I was just thinking about when
we watched Casablanca last week.

513
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:01,512
That new print is great, huh?

514
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:07,352
"Of all the lousy gin joints in the
world, why'd you have to pick mine?"

515
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:13,858
Of all the finocchi priests,
why did I get the one who's straight?

516
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:18,029
Carmela.

517
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:20,740
Come on, it's a joke.

518
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:45,306
I would have done it myself,
but some people came along.

519
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:48,893
Anyway, listen.
It's a gray Town Car, new model.

520
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:51,354
Pick him up on the Colby campus.

521
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:53,398
Where on the Colby campus?

522
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:56,693
His kid's applying,
the fucking admissions office.

523
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:59,153
- Oh.
- You follow him.

524
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:02,532
Outside of town, you pull
up alongside, boom! 12-gauge.

525
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:04,534
- Fuck that.
- Do it...

526
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:07,453
...or you'll never
get another bag off me.

527
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:15,628
No, no, no. Fuck that.
Fuck that!

528
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:18,506
Want the cops to know who
burnt the Historical House?

529
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:21,467
Fuck you, fuckwad!

530
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:25,638
We were volunteer firemen
together, asshole! I know!

531
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:37,316
Yeah, is Dougy in?

532
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:35,142
- Good morning, rat.
- Who are you? What is this?

533
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:37,645
Don't make me laugh. You fuck!

534
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:39,730
Teddy, there must be something...

535
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:42,525
It's Tony.
Know how much trouble you're in?

536
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:45,236
You took an oath and you broke it.

537
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:48,114
I could have killed you
outside the motel.

538
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:49,949
Your daughter was drunk.

539
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:51,617
I was in the parking lot.

540
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:55,246
I didn't do it because of her.
I told myself:

541
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:58,124
"It's just a coincidence...

542
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:01,043
...he's taking her to college."
- With wiseguys...

543
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:02,962
...the hustle never ends.

544
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:05,882
If you'd shot me, your life
would have been over.

545
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:07,800
Please. I'm begging you.

546
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:12,096
Jimmy says hello from hell!

547
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,024
Where've you been?

548
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:50,569
The motel didn't have the watch.
I went to the restaurant.

549
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:53,322
I had to wait
for them to open.

550
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:55,366
The restaurant had your watch?

551
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:58,911
I took it off in the bathroom
while I washed my hands.

552
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:01,455
You ready?
You'll be late for Bowdoin.

553
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:17,847
What's up with that?

554
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:24,478
Oh, the restaurant.

555
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:27,440
I tried the back door
and there were puddles.

556
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:32,903
It was dumb, I know.

557
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:40,369
Your hand is bleeding!

558
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,705
You saw that man, didn't you?

559
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:46,792
I cut it on a screen door.
What man?

560
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:49,170
The man you said you didn't know.

561
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,464
What do you think happened?

562
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,591
I don't know. A fight?

563
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,177
You're making it a big deal,
and you don't know!

564
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:59,305
You were on the pay phone
again at 1 a.m!

565
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:02,058
I was on the pay phone at 1 a.m?

566
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:04,018
Excuse me, Miss Cuervo Añejo.

567
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:08,814
You can't remember what happened.
You were seeing pink elephants!

568
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:12,026
I warned you not to drink.

569
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:19,241
Dad, you're being honest
with me, right?

570
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:21,160
You're gonna hurt my feelings.

571
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:25,164
We have that kind of relationship.

572
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:30,503
That's right. We do or we don't.
It takes two to tango.

573
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:35,049
- Dad...
- What?

574
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:42,681
Nothing.

575
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:51,565
I love you.

576
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,777
I love you too.

577
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:02,868
- Where's my paper?
- I forgot.

578
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,161
She forgot.

579
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:13,254
Miss Soprano. Come on in.

580
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:19,135
Shall we talk about your future?

581
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:48,414
He's our most famous alumnus.

582
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:12,646
Oh, here they are.
The two Ivy Leaguers!

583
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:14,523
How was it?
Want to eat?

584
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:17,151
It was good. I gotta call Hunter.

585
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:18,360
Hey.

586
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:23,157
- Gee, she spared me no boring detail.
- I'll be back!

587
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:25,910
What a trip. I'm beat.

588
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:28,913
What, New England?
It's so gorgeous.

589
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:32,041
You still sound nasal,
but you look better.

590
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:34,335
Any cold pasta?

591
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:37,046
There was some ziti,
but it got eaten.

592
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,674
The whole tray? From last Sunday?

593
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:44,553
Monsignor Jughead was here.

594
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:48,724
If you are referring
to Father Intintola, yes, he was.

595
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:53,312
- He spent the night here.
- Yeah, right.

596
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:55,397
Okay.

597
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:01,278
The priest spent the night here?
What happened?

598
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:03,322
- Nothing.
- Where was Anthony?

599
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:05,407
Sleeping over at Jason's.

600
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:09,912
The priest spent the night here,
nothing happened.

601
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:14,625
- You're telling me this because?
- You might hear something.

602
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:17,002
His car was out front all night.

603
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:21,423
You know what? This is too fucked-up
for me even to think about.

604
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:30,140
What'd you guys do for 12 hours,
play "Name That Pope"?

605
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:35,104
- He gave me Communion.
- I'll bet he gave you Communion.

606
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:36,355
Excuse me?

607
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:40,484
The guy spends the night here,
and all he does is slip you a wafer?

608
00:54:40,902 --> 00:54:44,029
- That's verging on sacrilege.
- I didn't mean to verge.

609
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:46,865
- Do you think I'm lying?
- It sounds...

610
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:51,870
Would I have told you if we did? Do
I look like the frigging Thorn Bird?

611
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:56,458
He's a fag. That's it.

612
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:59,962
Otherwise, I gotta question
what I'm hearing.

613
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:02,715
Tony, you are a sketch.

614
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:10,097
Oh, by the way,
your therapist called.

615
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:12,391
Jennifer?

616
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:18,439
Carm!

617
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:23,944
I thought you'd think it was weird
if I saw a woman psychiatrist.

618
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:30,367
Carm, come on! It's just therapy,
that's all! We just talk!
