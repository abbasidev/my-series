1
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:40,641
Here, take a swig.

2
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,518
And don't backwash.

3
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,394
Shit! Don't break it.

4
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:46,438
It's time for the nuns' rosary.

5
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:49,691
This is 8th-grade history.
Stealing the sacramental wine?

6
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:52,027
It's not sacramental
till they bless it.

7
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,363
All clear!
Are you gonna confess this?

8
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:57,282
I'll tell them I stole something,
not what.

9
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:01,411
Go! Form it up!
Form it up, let's go, boys.

10
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,580
Hustle, hustle, hustle!

11
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:06,792
There we go, straight lines.
Straight lines.

12
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,252
There you go.

13
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,587
Soprano, DiCarlucci, shake a leg.

14
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,674
Jumping jacks.
Ten of them, count them down.

15
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,926
- Three, four, five...
- Two, three...

16
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:20,055
six, seven, eight...
four, five, six...

17
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:23,142
nine, ten.
seven, eight, nine...

18
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,815
DiCarlucci, Barber, Soprano,
let's go! Sync up!

19
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,610
What's so funny? Care to share?

20
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,822
Sorry, Mr. Meskimmin.

21
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,660
Okay, kick-outs, boys!

22
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,412
Floor! Kick!

23
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,414
Return! Up!

24
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,666
I'm dizzier than shit!

25
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,836
Kick! Return! Up!

26
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:52,880
Fuck, here he comes.

27
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,717
Whoa, floor, kick, turn, up!

28
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:00,929
What's going on here?

29
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:04,308
Come on, stand up, on your feet,
let's go.

30
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:09,771
Whoa.

31
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:12,441
- Man!
- I don't feel so good.

32
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,359
I don't want any excuses.

33
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:18,572
Mr. Meskimmin, I gotta go
to the bathroom.

34
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:20,782
Is that alcohol on your breath?

35
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:41,637
Hey, how's the boy?

36
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:46,433
How am I? I got dust up the crack
of my ass, and I'm starving to death.

37
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,811
You're doing an excellent job.
Take pleasure in that.

38
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:54,274
He's been ragging in my ear all day.
I'd like to kill him. Hear that, prick?

39
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:57,486
Get him out of here.
Just get him the hell out of here.

40
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:00,322
- Is there a problem?
- You made your point.

41
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,658
- I made my point.
- You made your point.

42
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,785
- What point?
- Enough with work stoppage.

43
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:09,915
This union safety official stays until
he deems this place is free of hazard.

44
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,334
- I have the money.
- You do?

45
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:16,213
Christopher, see if he's paid up
his union dues...

46
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:19,174
...then pop a wheel cover
to check the brakes.

47
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,176
I'll get right on it.

48
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,847
I'll get your money, okay?

49
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,724
We shall return.

50
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,644
Halle-fucking-lujah!

51
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,981
Give me your cell.
I gotta call Carmela.

52
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:37,985
You sure it was them?

53
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:42,531
They were drunk in gym class. Byron
Barber vomited all over the teacher.

54
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,408
I spat it out.

55
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,617
Anthony.

56
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,786
You're gonna lie to me now?

57
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:51,415
He's sorry, Father Hagy.
He'll be sorrier when he gets home.

58
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,625
Anthony, why don't you wait outside?

59
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:04,386
He's suspended for three days.

60
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,638
Let me pay for the wine.

61
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:09,182
This isn't just
a crime against property...

62
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,810
...it's an affront
to our holy sacristy.

63
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,940
I've asked Dr. Galani,
our school psychologist, to join us.

64
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,862
He's been keeping an eye on Anthony.
Meeting with his teachers.

65
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:24,573
Why don't you pick it up
from there, doctor?

66
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,869
Um, hi.

67
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:33,373
In many respects, Anthony is
a normal, healthy 8th-grader.

68
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,876
Sister Patricia, his art teacher...

69
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:39,588
...thinks he shows strong skills
in spatial orientation.

70
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:44,051
But the thing is, and it's not
just this one incident...

71
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,929
...Anthony sometimes has trouble
following the rules...

72
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,432
...weighing consequences.

73
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:55,270
At times, doesn't think
before he acts.

74
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,480
And...

75
00:05:56,898 --> 00:06:01,610
...it's thought that there's a good
possibility Anthony could be ADD.

76
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,529
ADD?

77
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,240
- Attention deficit disorder.
- I knew it.

78
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,701
- I knew there was something.
- What is it?

79
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,787
It's an aggregate of symptoms.

80
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:14,289
Inattention, impulsivity...

81
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,959
...sometimes, although not always,
hyperactivity.

82
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:20,962
To be sure, we'll give him
a thorough evaluation.

83
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,423
He needs a whack upside the head.

84
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:26,009
If he's got an illness?
It's an illness, right?

85
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:30,305
You'd hit somebody who's sick?
You'd hit somebody with polio?

86
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:34,768
You hit Anthony?

87
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:38,647
Nobody gets hit in our house.
Not exactly my idea.

88
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:42,651
What's happening if you can't
do a little tarantella on the kids...

89
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,945
...when they step out of line?

90
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,822
So what happens now?

91
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:49,324
He'll be given a complete battery
of testing.

92
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:52,285
Psychological, behavioral, medical.

93
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,162
Let me ask you a question.

94
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:57,416
These other kids,
you keeping an eye on them?

95
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,794
Are you testing them?
The ones that aren't named Soprano?

96
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,213
There's no immediate plans for that.

97
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:08,009
We attend to every child at Verbum Dei
according to his own circumstances.

98
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:12,347
And so what do we,
as the parents, do?

99
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,015
Nothing?

100
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:19,396
Oh, no, I mean, Anthony's misbehaved.
He should be consequenced.

101
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,442
It's a crime!

102
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:28,196
To suspend that child from school
with all the money you give them?

103
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:33,410
That gym teacher shit a brick when your
friend puked on his boots, huh, Anthony?

104
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:35,454
Want to encourage him?

105
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,956
Whatever happened
to "boys will be boys"?

106
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,334
He stole from the church.
They don't make them any lower.

107
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:44,171
- What a loser.
- That's enough out of you.

108
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:47,174
Oh, his father was the same way.

109
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,635
I practically lived
in that vice principal's office.

110
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,346
Could we not, please?

111
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,974
You only remember
what you want to remember.

112
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,352
Yeah, well, I must've had
another son...

113
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:02,272
...who stole a car when he was
10 years old.

114
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,900
He could barely see over the wheel.

115
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:07,694
He was a hellion.
Him and his little crew...

116
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,905
...they stole lobsters on the boats...

117
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:13,074
...and sold them for a buck
on Bloomfield Avenue.

118
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,284
Really?

119
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:18,288
How many times must I say it?
I don't want that talk in front of him.

120
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,540
That is wrong, and I don't condone it!

121
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,958
Yeah. Sure.

122
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,085
- Who are you yelling at?
- What?

123
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:25,629
You stupe.

124
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:28,048
- What did you say?
- I didn't say anything.

125
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:30,509
What's he doing now? What's going on?

126
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:31,718
He yells at me...

127
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,679
Anthony, I thought this could wait
till after dinner.

128
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,389
Your father and I have talked.

129
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,602
You are not to play Mario Cart
or go skateboarding for three weeks.

130
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,521
And no TV.

131
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,730
No.

132
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,857
You won't sit on that Internet.

133
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:49,528
And every day, you'll ride your bike
to go visit Grandma.

134
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,112
Oh, that'll be nice.

135
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,614
It's not fair!

136
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,711
- Some fucking day, huh?
- I feel like a bomb went off.

137
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:13,927
You know that stuff the doctor said?
I never saw any of that in Anthony.

138
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:16,972
You never notice how he picks
at the tongue of his shoe?

139
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,474
Like he can't help himself.

140
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:22,102
If he even has this thing.

141
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:24,479
Something's going on.

142
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,697
- Carm?
- Yep?

143
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:37,158
- Do you think he knows?
- I don't know.

144
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,786
She knows.

145
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:42,998
- Are you...?
- Really?

146
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,251
- What makes you say that?
- Are you in...?

147
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:51,673
I don't know. Things she says. She
makes remarks, like this today with him.

148
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:57,596
- Are you in the Mafia?
- She talk to you about me?

149
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,055
Talk? To me?

150
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,690
Something happen on that college trip?

151
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:12,068
Happen?

152
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,030
Like what?

153
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:18,283
I don't know, she seemed peculiar
when she got back.

154
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:25,373
I think pretty soon we're gonna
have to, you know...

155
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,293
...talk to her about the business.

156
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:31,630
Yeah. The two of us
should sit down with Meadow.

157
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,965
Talk as a family.

158
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:38,345
With him, they'll test him
and we'll see what's what.

159
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,389
Right?

160
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,145
Good night.

161
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,397
Good night.

162
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,498
Maybe I don't want to admit
something's wrong with my kid...

163
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,541
...but this sounds like bullshit.

164
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:09,918
What do you mean?

165
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:13,922
If he's got a disease, why punish him?
Isn't that bullshit?

166
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,383
ADD is a controversial subject.

167
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:20,762
Is it a disease, or a way for
psychologists to line their pockets?

168
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:29,062
Many children can really benefit
by professional intervention.

169
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,563
He got in trouble.

170
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:33,650
So you don't consider his behavior
out of the norm?

171
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,110
No.

172
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,363
I don't know.

173
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,865
What do I know about it?

174
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,117
What do you mean?

175
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,828
Oh, I gotta spell it out for you?

176
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:49,332
Do you see his behavior
as a reflection of your own?

177
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:56,673
Look, like I said, maybe I don't want
to admit there's something wrong...

178
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,843
...but if he's got this thing...

179
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:01,678
...we'll deal with it.

180
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,597
If he had polio, we'd deal with it.

181
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:08,143
You pick up the pieces
and you go on from there.

182
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,688
So that's what we're gonna do.

183
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:23,116
Do you want to say anything else
about this?

184
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:32,959
Well, last time you were telling me
that you had intimate feelings for me.

185
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,837
But you've not mentioned it.

186
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,423
Intimate feelings?

187
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,842
I think I said I was in love.

188
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,763
How are you doing with it?

189
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:51,895
I can't turn off my feelings because
you say it's a byproduct of therapy.

190
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:54,898
I never said to
turn off your feelings.

191
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,693
Well, I already got a girlfriend.

192
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:02,322
She's Russian, 24.

193
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,164
How old are you?

194
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:17,879
It's interesting it took you so long
to tell me you had a girlfriend.

195
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,131
How are you doing with it?

196
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,597
I gotta ask you one more question
about my son.

197
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:32,811
You think I should
go easy on him now...

198
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,562
...or press him harder?

199
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,731
That's difficult to say.

200
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,945
What, you want a raise, maybe,
to figure this out?

201
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:50,411
Anthony! Anthony Jr., you get up!

202
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,832
Why? I don't have to go to school.
I'm suspended.

203
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:58,753
No lying in bed all day.
We're not running a hotel over here.

204
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:00,922
Get up, have some breakfast!

205
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,424
I don't want any. I'm not hungry.

206
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,595
What you are gonna do today
is get up and go rake.

207
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:10,557
Then pull all of those leaves
out of the pool filter.

208
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,101
You're gonna do some work around here.

209
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,687
Mom, where's my gray jacket?

210
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,940
I left it downstairs.
What'd you do with it?

211
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,567
Hello?

212
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:26,614
Anthony, turn off that music!
Your father is sleeping!

213
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:29,075
You said I couldn't watch TV
or play Nintendo.

214
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,619
- What?
- You said nothing about music!

215
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:34,914
- Turn it off right now!
- Why?

216
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,835
Your father is sleeping,
for chrissake!

217
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:42,964
Mom, I can't find it. Where is it?

218
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,402
Hey, Johnny!

219
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,154
Johnny, come on!

220
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,241
Uncle Jun, why are you here so early?

221
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:12,994
Anthony, where's your dad?
He said he'd be outside.

222
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,871
Want me to go get him?

223
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:18,917
Did you hear the game last night?
Joey Pepitone, three RBIs.

224
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,336
No kidding.
My mom made me go to bed.

225
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,254
You miss your bus to school...

226
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:25,715
...you walk through
the colored neighborhood.

227
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,843
Junior! Big fancy car.

228
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,888
We're going to my sister's,
and you promised to...

229
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:35,183
Nonstop!
Don't you get sick of yourself?

230
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,853
Dad, could you and Uncle Jun give me
a ride to school?

231
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,189
Not now, Tony.
You be good, though.

232
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:44,525
Pay attention to what
those teachers tell you.

233
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:45,777
Okay.

234
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:52,200
- See you, Ma.
- Okay. Be good.

235
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,216
Hey, wait up!

236
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,760
Shit!

237
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:14,430
Hey, Rocco!

238
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,933
Come on, move, move, guys!
Move, move!

239
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:21,145
Hey, John, one more day, man!
One more day.

240
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:25,024
- There's gonna be a huge payoff.
- I'm gonna kill you!

241
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,531
What do you got?

242
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,743
What the fuck is this?
What the fuck are you bringing me here?

243
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:40,456
Who are you fucking with, Rocco?

244
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,252
- Fuck you!
- Motherfucker!

245
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,713
You asshole!

246
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,007
What are you bringing to me here?

247
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,384
Piece of shit!

248
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,053
What the fucking...?

249
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,140
Christ!

250
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,109
You're up.

251
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,196
Who the fuck can sleep
with all this shit going on?

252
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:16,284
I thought about Jefferson Airplane
this morning. How about that?

253
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,995
1967.

254
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,956
- Made me think of my father.
- What about him?

255
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:27,045
First time I saw him
whack the shit out of somebody.

256
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:29,380
What made you think about that?

257
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:34,385
Something to do with my son, I think,
what's been going on.

258
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:40,516
Why did your father
whack the shit out of some guy?

259
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,644
I never saw him do something
like that.

260
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:46,189
He used to whack us kids around
a little.

261
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,648
Really?

262
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:52,653
Yeah, the belt was his favorite
child development tool.

263
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,823
This was different.

264
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,868
You could tell he knew
what he was doing.

265
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,914
How did you feel about
your father after that?

266
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,541
I didn't want him to do it to me.

267
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,585
Seriously.

268
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:10,671
What should I say?
I was glad he wasn't a fag.

269
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,841
- How did you and your father get along?
- Good.

270
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:17,178
He was a good guy, my father.
Everybody liked him.

271
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,305
He knew how to have a good time.

272
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,558
He loved shellfish, clams, oysters.

273
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,814
Taught us how to eat them. You put
Worcestershire on, suck them down.

274
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:30,149
It's good.

275
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:33,027
My mother never ate anything raw.

276
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,406
But he wasn't around much.

277
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,118
What did he do for a living?

278
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,537
Retail meat and provisions.

279
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,252
And a little numbers,
extortion, loan-sharking.

280
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,962
How did you feel about that?

281
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,673
- How did I feel?
- About your father...

282
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,676
...being engaged
in illegal activities?

283
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,763
You know,
I never really knew about it.

284
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,306
When did you find out?

285
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:03,891
Who remembers?

286
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,311
You thought of that incident
this morning.

287
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:11,274
Are you concerned that your son is
going to find out about you?

288
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,152
Don't talk to me about
legitimate business.

289
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,154
What about chemical companies?

290
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:21,200
Dumping that shit into rivers and they
got deformed babies popping up all over.

291
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,579
Does he know anything?

292
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:26,706
I don't know.

293
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,166
Has he asked you?

294
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:29,876
No.

295
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,920
- How will you handle that?
- I don't know.

296
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,965
Did you ever talk to
your father about it?

297
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:37,258
Are you kidding?

298
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:47,768
No kidding, Tony.
That doesn't sound like Anthony.

299
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,521
Yesterday, he's a boy.
Today, I worry about him.

300
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,106
Teenagers.

301
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:55,526
My daughter gives me
feminist shit about this place.

302
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:59,238
How it "objectifies women."
Shit like that.

303
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,449
These girls pull down 1500 a week.

304
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,452
This bears no weight
with the principessa.

305
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:07,121
Meadow was one thing,
but this is my son.

306
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,457
Boys are different from girls.

307
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:15,129
Pussy, Kevin and Matt, they ever ask
you about this thing of ours?

308
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:18,007
I lied through my teeth,
but they knew. Fucking nitwits.

309
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,134
They love me anyway.

310
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,638
It's hard to raise kids
in an information age.

311
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,973
You know, to protect them.

312
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:32,813
Hey, what's up?

313
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:36,984
Who's got an anniversary
or a special occasion?

314
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,861
What are these, antiques?

315
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:42,990
I was picking up the Chinaman's vig,
and the FedEx van was wide open.

316
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:44,992
The guy went in for a burger.

317
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:49,038
No shit, FedEx. They're usually
pretty careful with those.

318
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,790
You did this in daylight?

319
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,333
Nobody saw me.

320
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,043
That's interstate commerce.

321
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:57,546
You want to be in prison
for a stunt like that, be my guest.

322
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,508
I'd take a licking
but keep on ticking.

323
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,343
I'm getting out of here.

324
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:04,178
Jesus Christ!

325
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,014
What's with his ass?

326
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,017
He's got a lot on his mind.

327
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:15,690
What do you think is going on
in this one, Anthony?

328
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,985
I don't know.
How many more are left?

329
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:21,404
The quicker you answer,
the faster we'll be done.

330
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,200
Whatever pops in your mind.

331
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,202
There's no guy?

332
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,914
Okay, good.
Where do you think he is?

333
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,376
Out buying food for the horse?

334
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,379
Anything else?

335
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,757
Watching TV, maybe?

336
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:45,553
Maybe he's watching South Park.
Number one's on tonight.

337
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:50,599
Aliens abduct Cartman and give him an
anal probe and it makes him fart fire.

338
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,399
You're home.

339
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:03,279
You know, if it's bad, the ADD,
they put Anthony in special ed.

340
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,742
The doctors say that?

341
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:11,329
Doctors don't know anything yet.
They started testing today.

342
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:13,289
I picked up these books at the mall.

343
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,291
Help Me To Help My Child?

344
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:16,917
Listen to this.

345
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,587
"About 50% of children
diagnosed with ADD...

346
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:22,548
...receive help from
special education teachers."

347
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,925
We don't even know
that's what he's got.

348
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:29,347
You're right. Let's just be ignorant.
Why worry about anything now?

349
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,184
You blame me, don't you?

350
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:35,603
Who said anything about that?

351
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,646
No, go ahead. You blame me.

352
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,190
I blame myself.

353
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:41,859
- For what?
- For what.

354
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,613
For staying with me?

355
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,656
I have two eyes.

356
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:52,870
Who do we blame our daughter on?

357
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:58,084
Straight-A student, National Honor
Society, featured soloist in the choir.

358
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,336
Yeah, this isn't going anywhere.

359
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:03,714
"Like father, like son," right?
What about "Daddy's little girl"?

360
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:10,012
My son's got your Uncle Lenny in his
gene pool. Do I blame you for that?

361
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:11,806
If it helps you.

362
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:28,322
Hi, Grandma.

363
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:31,659
Well, look who's here.

364
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,620
- Oh, look at that little face.
- Ow.

365
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:38,833
Pearl, meet my grandson.

366
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:40,501
This is your grandson?

367
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:44,130
He rode his bike all the way over
to visit his grandma.

368
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:45,840
How do you like that?

369
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:48,050
How come he's not in school?

370
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:51,220
- Because he was a bad boy!
- Ow.

371
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,722
Yes, he was, that's why.

372
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,058
He's a big one!

373
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:01,897
She had a stroke.

374
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:05,526
Now half her brain is gone.

375
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:10,322
So what shall we do?
What shall we do?

376
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,283
Let's see.

377
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,702
Let's play Scrabble.

378
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:18,372
You'd be surprised how good
your grandmother is.

379
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:21,208
I don't think so, Gram.
I'm kind of wiped.

380
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:26,589
Oh, you're a 13-year-old boy.
You're too young to be so tired.

381
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:31,218
They sent me to a psychiatrist
all morning. I took a million tests.

382
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:33,053
A psychiatrist?

383
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:36,098
You know, because I got
suspended and everything.

384
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:39,768
They sent you to a psychiatrist?

385
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,562
Yeah.

386
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,732
But that's crazy.
That's all nonsense.

387
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,903
That's nothing but a racket
for the Jews!

388
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:50,779
Dad goes.

389
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:54,033
- He does not.
- Yes, he does.

390
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:56,577
- He does not.
- Yes, he does.

391
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,746
To a psychiatrist?

392
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,039
Yeah.

393
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,124
He does not.

394
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,584
He does too.

395
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,086
Why do you say that?
That's ridiculous!

396
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,756
I heard him and Mom talking about it.

397
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,258
What does he need a psychiatrist for?

398
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,262
Is it okay if I take
that pear, Grandma?

399
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:21,519
He goes to talk about his mother.
That's what he's doing.

400
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:24,897
He talks about me, he complains.

401
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:28,692
"She didn't do this, she did that."

402
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:35,282
Oh, I gave my life to my children
on a silver platter.

403
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:38,786
And this is how he repays me.

404
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:50,714
- Dad, what's that noise?
- Noise?

405
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,383
It's a flat tire.

406
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:55,135
I asked you to clean the nails
from the driveway.

407
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,640
I was praying for something like this.

408
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:02,851
I spent too much money on braces
for two years...

409
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:05,229
...not to take you to the dentist now.

410
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:09,316
Maybe we should call the Auto Club.

411
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:14,113
We change tires at our house.
Watch and learn.

412
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:22,538
Yesterday, with the psychologist,
how'd that go?

413
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:25,165
Okay.

414
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:28,252
Yeah? What'd you guys do?

415
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:32,756
He made me look at pictures. And then
I had to say something about them.

416
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,925
Did you talk about
anything interesting?

417
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:38,053
That's kind of between
me and my therapist.

418
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:41,015
He said I don't have to
say anything if I didn't want to.

419
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,892
That's what we pay extra for
at that school?

420
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:52,776
The other night at dinner,
you made a remark.

421
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,613
- No, I didn't.
- Yeah, you did.

422
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:58,907
I'm not mad. I just need to know
what you meant by it.

423
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:01,327
I didn't mean anything.

424
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:03,120
Come on.

425
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,543
Kids at school said some stuff.

426
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,503
What'd they say?

427
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,297
That you were in the Mafia.

428
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,717
What do you think?

429
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:18,552
I don't know.

430
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,721
The guys at
Uncle Jackie's funeral.

431
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:24,433
And those other guys writing
license plates and taking pictures.

432
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:27,144
Those were feds, right?
Like in Godfather I.

433
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:31,106
Uncle Jackie's funeral. Right.

434
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,776
I found this page with Uncle Jackie
on the Web.

435
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:38,405
It said he ran some union that ripped
off these pension things or something.

436
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,910
Uncle Jackie was a complicated man.

437
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:44,953
But you loved him, right?

438
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,289
Yeah.

439
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:50,125
You didn't see me on the Web, did you?

440
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:51,919
No.

441
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:54,129
That's right.

442
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:58,300
Give me a hand so we can
get the algae scraped off your teeth.

443
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:04,723
I'm going crazy with this shit,
what he knows, what he doesn't know.

444
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:08,102
He'll find out eventually.
What's the difference?

445
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:14,274
Me, my father. It's probably
in the genes, right?

446
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:16,819
You know, this ADD thing.

447
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,363
It's probably genetical.

448
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:24,451
What about Pussy?

449
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,705
He's an acquaintance of mine.

450
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,958
This guy is a stone gangster,
and he's got three kids.

451
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:33,168
One graduated,
and two are going to Villanova.

452
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:36,672
- How do you account for that?
- Then you got Leopold and Loeb.

453
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,590
They murdered this kid for fun...

454
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:41,468
...and their father was
a successful businessman.

455
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:45,305
Do you hold your father responsible
for what you've become?

456
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:48,809
Sometimes I think about
what life would've been like...

457
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:52,938
...if my father hadn't gotten mixed up
in what he got mixed up in.

458
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,649
How life would've been different.

459
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:59,987
Maybe I'd be selling patio furniture
in San Diego.

460
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:03,532
We talked last time about
how you felt when you became aware...

461
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:07,453
...of your father's criminal life.
Any more thoughts on that?

462
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:14,543
When you first started therapy,
you said you had this dream...

463
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,253
...about those ducks.

464
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:19,882
They flew away with your penis.
It was a bad omen...

465
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:24,344
...that something was going to happen
in your family.

466
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,263
Is this the terrible thing?

467
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:32,478
Look, if you know something, please,
quit fucking around.

468
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:35,189
I think it's important to remember.

469
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:38,317
You said you liked
the History Channel.

470
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:42,321
He who doesn't understand history
is doomed to repeat it.

471
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:47,075
- Let's talk about your father.
- My father.

472
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,125
Heads up!

473
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:05,469
Why are you smiling?

474
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,596
Just thinking about my uncle.

475
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:10,432
He used to throw the ball with me.

476
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:12,976
The one with whom you have
all the static?

477
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:14,728
Yeah.

478
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,522
Uncle Jun.

479
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:21,610
He was always practicing his curve ball
outside in front of the house.

480
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:26,281
I was probably about 8 or 9.

481
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,494
Then my sister came out.

482
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:33,372
The one who lives in California?

483
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:34,915
Janice.

484
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:39,002
How does she feel about your parents?

485
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:42,172
Who cares what she thinks?
She calls herself Vishnamantha.

486
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:45,300
Soprano isn't good enough for her.
Wannabe dot-head.

487
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,845
Why were you thinking of your uncle?

488
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,556
I don't know.

489
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,057
What are you doing?

490
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,101
I'm getting in the car.

491
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,019
Why? Where are you going?

492
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:57,938
Someplace.

493
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,192
Where are you going?
Can I come?

494
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:05,571
Your mom wants you to get
the screens down to the basement.

495
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,282
No, I want to go with you guys.

496
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,533
He said no.

497
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,368
Janice...

498
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:15,122
...you both won't be going,
you talk to your brother like that.

499
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,549
Go on.

500
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:31,555
My mother was inside, cooking the meat
for the gravy, you know, the "red lead."

501
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:34,349
Pork bones and veal.
It was a Sunday.

502
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,436
- But you said...
- I said we'd see.

503
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,980
What's the matter with her?
She won't eat.

504
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:42,232
You won't have to get me anything
for Christmas.

505
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,568
You won't have to tell me
to take the trash out.

506
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,987
I shouldn't have to tell you
to take the trash out.

507
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:49,323
Why can't I have this?
It isn't fair!

508
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:52,159
I don't want to hear about
that stupid electric organ!

509
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:53,911
It's not stupid, it's fun.

510
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,580
Enough! He won't give me
a moment's peace.

511
00:31:56,789 --> 00:32:00,500
If Janice wanted it, she'd get it.
She always gets what she wants.

512
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:03,045
Where were they going?
Why couldn't I go?

513
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:05,172
Your sister does as she's told.

514
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,506
Right, I forgot.

515
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,676
Janice never does anything wrong.
She's just perfect.

516
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:11,929
You're driving me crazy!

517
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,306
No, I'm not.

518
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:15,891
She said what?

519
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:18,602
She was high-strung,
very dramatic.

520
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:20,938
Every night to her is
a night at the opera.

521
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:24,024
I could stick this fork in your eye!

522
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,944
She wasn't gonna do it.

523
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:30,656
Holy shit, that's why
I'm remembering all this.

524
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:34,117
- On account of where they were going.
- Where were they going?

525
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:36,828
I found out a couple Sundays later.

526
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:40,207
The toll now stands
at 11 dead and 600 wounded...

527
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,334
...as well as
hundreds of businesses...

528
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:44,795
Mom, I'm going to
the CYO to play ball.

529
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:48,757
Take a bat with you, what they're
doing on Springfield Avenue.

530
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:52,219
- looting and sniper fire
along Springfield Avenue continue...

531
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:56,348
...with Mayor Hugh Addonizio placing
blame on outside agitators...

532
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,084
Come on, Dad, let's go!

533
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,753
I'm coming, I'm coming.

534
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:32,175
Keep your sticky fingers off the car.
I just waxed the damn thing.

535
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:39,516
Can I steer?

536
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,102
Maybe on the way home, honey.

537
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:57,409
Here we are.

538
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:08,587
Come on.

539
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:45,624
Uncle Jun?

540
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:49,294
Buy something nice.

541
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:01,515
My heart was broken.

542
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:04,851
You felt your father was
showing favoritism.

543
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:07,979
I still remember that feeling
in the pit of my stomach.

544
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,023
Did you confront them?

545
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:14,653
Have you been listening to me?
Kids don't confront in my family.

546
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:17,989
How does this pertain to
the situation with your son?

547
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:23,120
This amusement park is where I found
out my father wasn't like other fathers.

548
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:25,789
I took the bus this time.

549
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,126
It was three transfers from Newark.

550
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:33,547
I had this candy bar in my pocket.

551
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,424
It had sand or lint
or something on it.

552
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,434
What you doing?
Where you spitting?

553
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,061
I ain't doing nothing!

554
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:50,397
You threw that wrapper on the floor.

555
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,482
- Pick it up!
- Leave me alone!

556
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:54,401
Come back! Pick it up!

557
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:02,951
What in the world?

558
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:10,000
Stop or I'll shoot!

559
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,960
You're under arrest!

560
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,504
Stop!

561
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,093
You're under arrest.

562
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:21,970
My leg!

563
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:25,599
Name was Cicchi Sasso, my
father's cousin on his mother's side.

564
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:29,352
Got out of Vietnam on account
of cops blew his kneecap off.

565
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,484
What's the matter with you cops?

566
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,779
Can't bring your kid to
an amusement park no more?

567
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:41,489
Daddy! Daddy!

568
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,575
It's okay, baby. It's okay.

569
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:46,036
You go home to Mommy, sweetheart.

570
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:49,789
Va fangool, why don't you go
lock up the melanzane?

571
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:51,750
They're burning down Newark.

572
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:05,138
I want my lawyer.
I'm not saying shit to you.

573
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,474
That's Johnny-boy Soprano!

574
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:14,231
Asshole, you're hurting my wrist.

575
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:20,570
Get the fuck in there, Clarabell.

576
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:26,076
He used Janice as a front.
They brought their daughters...

577
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:28,995
...so that their business
looked sweet and innocent.

578
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,830
That must've been devastating.

579
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,166
It turned out it was no big deal.

580
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:36,670
To see your father handcuffed
and led away by the police?

581
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:40,590
Well, at the time I thought
my head was gonna explode.

582
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:43,843
He looked helpless.

583
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:49,057
But when I got home, my mother
had a different perspective.

584
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:50,934
Which made me feel better.

585
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:53,728
So in her pain,
she reached out to you.

586
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:55,146
That's one way to put it.

587
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,942
Your father may not be home
for dinner. Go wash up.

588
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:01,444
- I know.
- What do you know?

589
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:04,531
I saw him getting arrested.
What did he do?

590
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:07,575
He didn't do anything!
They just pick on Italians.

591
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:11,788
Still, in my heart, I knew
my father was no freedom fighter.

592
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,999
So he went to jail?

593
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:15,709
He came home in a couple hours.

594
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,712
We were watching Ed Sullivan.

595
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:31,224
Hey! Livia!

596
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:33,059
Look who's home.

597
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:36,062
- What happened?
- What happened?

598
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,398
I got you cherry vanilla
at Nasto's.

599
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:42,527
That didn't take long.
Must be in good with the uppity-ups.

600
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:45,238
Let this be a lesson.

601
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:48,366
Those stupid cops,
they went to the wrong place.

602
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,618
Arrested the wrong guys.

603
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:52,954
How's my little girl?
You all right?

604
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:54,914
- I'm okay.
- Good.

605
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:58,251
Johnny-boy! Hey, Johnny-boy!

606
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:00,253
Good for you, Johnny.

607
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,714
Show those fucking sons of bitches.

608
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:04,257
What's up, Rocco?

609
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:09,137
So...

610
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:11,431
...everything okay?

611
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,392
I don't understand.
The man your father beat up...

612
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:17,103
...was the same one
congratulating him?

613
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:18,938
Yeah. One of them.

614
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:21,191
Rocco Allatore.

615
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,194
Why'd they arrest him?

616
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,863
He was in violation of his parole.

617
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:30,200
Association with known undesirables.

618
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:32,869
But nothing ever happened.
It just went away.

619
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,871
He'd been in prison?

620
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,664
He was away when I was a kid...

621
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,918
...but they told me he was
in Montana being a cowboy.

622
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:46,007
What?

623
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:52,555
My son is doomed, right?

624
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:54,474
Why do you say that?

625
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:57,936
This is the part where
I'm supposed to tell you...

626
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:01,189
...how terrible my father was
and the terrible things he did...

627
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,775
...and how he ruined my life.

628
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:07,570
But I'll tell you, I was proud
to be Johnny Soprano's kid.

629
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,948
When he beat the shit
out of that guy...

630
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:12,617
...I told the class
how tough my father was.

631
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,994
Is that how your son feels about you?

632
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:16,329
Yeah, probably.

633
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:19,040
And I'm glad.
I'm glad if he's proud of me.

634
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:22,627
But that's the bind I'm in.
I don't want him to be like me.

635
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,838
He could be anything he wants.

636
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:26,798
He could be like a guy
I knew in school.

637
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:29,509
His grandfather invented
ties for the end of salamis.

638
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:33,012
He made millions of dollars.
He's sitting on his ass.

639
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:36,474
Have you communicated this
to your son?

640
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:39,060
Not in so many words.

641
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:43,857
Probably not at all.

642
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,485
What's the difference?
You said it.

643
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:50,363
It's in the blood. It's hereditary.

644
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:54,367
Genetic predispositions are only that.
Predispositions.

645
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:58,580
It's not a destiny written in stone.
People have choices.

646
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:01,040
She finally offers an opinion.

647
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:05,545
Well, they do. You think everything
that happens is preordained?

648
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:09,299
You don't think that human beings
possess free will?

649
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:12,594
How come I'm not making
fucking pots in Peru?

650
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:16,973
You're born to this shit.
You are what you are.

651
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:19,976
Within that there's
a range of choices.

652
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:21,561
This is America.

653
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,647
Right. America.

654
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:28,443
So, Livia, what do you think, huh?

655
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:31,070
Okies and misfits,
that's who goes there.

656
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:33,448
Losers, the Beverly Hillbillies.

657
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,867
So now Rocco Allatore's a loser?

658
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:40,371
I've had to rough Rocco up because of
money, but he's got a fucking brain.

659
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:41,831
He's opening a new book.

660
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:44,751
After that gets up,
we get a little cash flow...

661
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:47,462
Oh, Mr. Cash Flow!
Big businessman now.

662
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:50,673
What do you know?
You're scared of your own shadow.

663
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:53,676
Reno is growing by
leaps and bounds, Livia.

664
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:56,596
It's a chance to get in
on the ground floor.

665
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:59,766
After Rocco gets the book up,
he'll open a supper club.

666
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:03,686
- He wants me to run it.
- A supper club? Are you drunk?

667
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:06,147
Jesus Christ Almighty!

668
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,399
Fucking albacore around my neck!

669
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:11,319
Every time I try...
Me and the kids'll go without you!

670
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:14,030
They are not going anywhere!

671
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:18,034
I'd rather smother them with a pillow
than take them to Nevada!

672
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:21,162
Always with the drama!

673
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,337
Livia, here you are.

674
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,965
Junior, you scared me to death.

675
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:35,176
I can't stay, but I didn't want
to let another day go by.

676
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,178
Business headaches
like you won't believe.

677
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:41,724
Oh, yeah, you and the other one.
With all your headaches.

678
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,434
Who, Tony?

679
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:45,436
Don't be so hard on him.

680
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:48,648
He's got a lot to learn, but he's
headed in the right direction.

681
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:52,485
Where to?
Overbrook State Mental Hospital?

682
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:53,653
What?

683
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:56,990
Hey, Uncle Jun. How you doing?

684
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:03,329
He's keeping his hair.

685
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:06,916
You see, what a good boy,
he comes to visit his mother.

686
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:14,507
My son's staying for dinner, Junior.
I don't suppose you have time.

687
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:16,718
You two want to visit each other.

688
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:20,972
Junior's very busy these days
with his headaches.

689
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:24,100
Not too busy to shoot the shit
with you, Tony.

690
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:25,852
We gotta catch a ball game.

691
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:28,521
Hey, you got my number. All right.

692
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,107
That man.

693
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:34,527
He's so full of himself
since becoming caporegime.

694
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,321
He makes me sick.

695
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:44,662
Remember the Allatores, Ma?

696
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:46,331
Oh, why wouldn't I?

697
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:49,542
They moved to Nevada.
They're billionaires now.

698
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:53,421
Oh, that Rocco Allatore,
he was a real go-getter.

699
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:57,133
- Didn't Dad want to go with him?
- Your father? No.

700
00:43:57,801 --> 00:44:01,888
Yeah, he did.
I remember you guys talking about it.

701
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:05,058
Allatore would start a business,
Dad would do it with him.

702
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:07,727
Rocco just got him all worked up,
that's all.

703
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:10,396
What is this with all
these questions?

704
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,523
Dad wanted to go with him.

705
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:13,816
You wouldn't let him.

706
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:16,069
Let him?

707
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:17,820
What do you mean?

708
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:22,075
You just tell me one time
your father didn't do...

709
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:24,786
...exactly as he wanted.

710
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:29,624
I don't know. Maybe this was
his chance to get out.

711
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:33,753
Dad was no choirboy, but maybe
with a little bit of support...

712
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:36,172
Mr. Sensitive now.

713
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:40,760
Well, if it bothers you, maybe
you better talk to a psychiatrist.

714
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:47,850
What are you talking about,
a psychiatrist?

715
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:53,147
That's what people do when they want
somebody to blame for their life.

716
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,566
You're a real stone player,
aren't you?

717
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:58,152
You threatened to smother
his children.

718
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:00,154
What does that mean?

719
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:03,491
Everybody thought Dad was ruthless,
but I gotta hand it to you.

720
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:06,077
If you'd been born
after those feminists...

721
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:08,413
...you would've been
the real gangster.

722
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:13,167
I don't know what
you're talking about!

723
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:22,218
Please, sit.

724
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:26,389
I know you're probably eager to hear
the results of our testing.

725
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:30,143
- How's Anthony doing?
- Good, I think. Don't you think so?

726
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:31,769
Yeah, I think so.

727
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:32,937
Okay.

728
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:34,981
Well, good.

729
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:37,650
Let's get to it.

730
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:41,571
The good news is, no evidence
of learning disability.

731
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:46,659
Cognitive function, verbal
and nonverbal intelligent testing...

732
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,120
...arithmetic and reading
evaluation...

733
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:51,456
...all within normal range.
- Thank goodness.

734
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,708
Got a clean bill of health.

735
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:56,794
No soft sign on
the neurological, either.

736
00:45:57,004 --> 00:46:00,715
That's all the good news.
Why don't you tell us the bad news?

737
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:05,178
Well, as to whether
Anthony has ADD...

738
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:08,181
...the results were interesting.

739
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:12,810
The APA Standard is for the subject
to manifest six out of nine...

740
00:46:13,061 --> 00:46:15,354
...possible symptoms of ADD.

741
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:19,275
In testing, Anthony manifested
five of those symptoms.

742
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:20,985
Five, really?

743
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:24,280
He often has difficulty
awaiting his turn...

744
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:28,910
...is often quote-unquote "on the go,"
or acts as if driven by a motor...

745
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:31,829
...often interrupts or intrudes
on others...

746
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,707
...and often fidgets
with hands or feet.

747
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:37,210
He fidgets with hands or feet?

748
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:39,378
That's right.

749
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:43,549
You mean, like, he fidgets.

750
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:45,802
Uh-huh.

751
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:49,096
And that's a sickness, to fidget?

752
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:52,391
Mr. Soprano, it's one of nine
possible symptoms.

753
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:56,854
What constitutes a fidget?

754
00:46:58,732 --> 00:46:59,732
Tony...

755
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,943
No, no, what constitutes a fidget?

756
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:05,905
So what if he fidgets?
Who doesn't fidget in school?

757
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:10,076
The kid's in puberty.
He gets a hard-on every 10 minutes.

758
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:12,328
Anthony is a borderline case.

759
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:14,956
He's not a case,
he's a 13-year-old boy.

760
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:18,543
Every time you see a problem,
you turn it into a disease.

761
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:21,504
He's a kid who made a mistake,
and he'll pay for it.

762
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:24,298
But he's gonna be fine. Come on.

763
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:30,304
I think he's right.

764
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:33,808
And I don't think we should have to
pay for this testing.

765
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,108
To oppose this
massive force bearing down on Midway...

766
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:46,612
...Admiral Nimitz had no battleships
in shape for the fight.

767
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:49,156
However, he had the carriers...

768
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:52,159
...Yorktown, Enterprise and Hornet.

769
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:56,789
This might prove to be the trump card.

770
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:25,318
Studying?

771
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:27,361
Government.

772
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:32,158
It's not the end of the world, Anth.

773
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:34,493
I'm depressed.

774
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:37,622
You're not depressed.

775
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:41,167
You're sad because you did
something stupid, and you got grounded.

776
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:44,587
You can't watch TV or play on your
computer for a couple weeks.

777
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,589
It's gonna stay like that.

778
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:49,717
It isn't fair.

779
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:52,386
You got that right.

780
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:05,900
What are you doing?

781
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,777
What's it look like?

782
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:11,697
Can I have one too?

783
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,866
This one's yours.

784
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:17,370
Gonna need sprinkles.

785
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:21,540
Okay.

786
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:23,459
You want nuts?

787
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:25,962
Yeah. M&M's?

788
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:52,196
Pretty good.
