1
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,361
So...

2
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,948
...you know, usual girl stuff.

3
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,742
She picks up the dry-cleaning
and shops.

4
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:04,039
Dr. Melfi has excellent taste, she
only shops at the fancy-schmancy deli.

5
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:08,210
The kind with the Italian name
but they don't have meatballs.

6
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,920
All right, what else?

7
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:14,174
What am I supposed to be looking for?
What's up with this cooz?

8
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,426
It's none of your fucking business.

9
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:19,388
You're on a strict need-to-know,
lieutenant.

10
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:22,724
I should knock you out for
what you did to her date.

11
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:28,147
What? I scared your goomar's date
a little. What's the big deal?

12
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,735
- This guy still come around?
- No.

13
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:38,157
He's not her type. He's a coward.
He nearly pissed himself.

14
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,243
Anything else?
I don't want to be here all day.

15
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:44,746
Yesterday she got off
at 9 and she went to bed early.

16
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:46,748
That's it?

17
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,375
That's it.

18
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:53,589
Here, buy yourself an iron.

19
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,097
Ready?

20
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:05,934
Decaf, right?

21
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:15,736
So how was your college trip
with your daughter?

22
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:20,908
I tell you, my life is like an
episode of Provolone-something.

23
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,451
What's going on?

24
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,953
My wife. All we do is fight.

25
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:28,123
And she's jealous of you.

26
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,961
Is that something that you feel or
has it been discussed with Carmela?

27
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,631
She didn't know you were a girl.

28
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:40,761
You know, a woman.
Excuse me, a doctor.

29
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,554
Woman doctor.

30
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:45,766
- Why did you take so long to tell her?
- I didn't.

31
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,352
You spilled the beans
when you called.

32
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:53,273
Let me ask you a different question.
Why a female? Why a female doctor?

33
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:58,153
She asked the same frigging question,
and I sometimes wonder myself.

34
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:01,073
- And?
- I'll tell you what I told her.

35
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:06,119
It was between two Jewish guys and
a paisan. So I picked the paisan.

36
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:11,500
What's the one thing your mother,
wife and daughter have in common?

37
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,335
They all break my balls.

38
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,548
I know what you mean.
They're all Italian, so what?

39
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:23,220
So maybe by coming clean with me,
you're dialoguing with them.

40
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,389
Let me ask you a question.

41
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,725
Why do you have me as a patient?

42
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:34,189
Most legit people I know
wouldn't make eye contact with me.

43
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,857
But you...

44
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,943
...you didn't flinch.

45
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:55,627
- Water's warm, come on in.
- Hey, Sammy. How are you?

46
00:04:57,588 --> 00:05:00,465
- I was just gonna make some coffee.
- Yeah?

47
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:01,717
How's Junior?

48
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,888
Sit the fuck down! Down!

49
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,893
That's how Junior is, Sammy.

50
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:14,271
I'm with little Jimmy Altieri.

51
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,317
Yeah, you paying Jimmy for this game?
Huh, Sammy?

52
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:19,526
No.

53
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:22,738
Are you paying someone for this game?

54
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,744
Now the party's over.

55
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:33,040
Junior Soprano is the new boss...

56
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,709
...and he ain't respecting
old arrangements.

57
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,419
Hey, you're lucky.

58
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:41,256
You stayed slender. You could
buy it right off the rack.

59
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,592
I want something special.

60
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:46,762
The boys are having
a little time for me.

61
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,348
You're wearing the suit
to the dinner, eh?

62
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:53,310
These guys today want to be buried
in a jogging outfit.

63
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:59,149
So how's your...
What's your oldest boy's name?

64
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:03,111
- Rafael. "Ralphie."
- Yeah.

65
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:04,780
- Good kid.
- Yeah.

66
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,282
He lost his son, you know.

67
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,909
What do you mean, "lost"?

68
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,118
Dead.

69
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:11,620
Morto.

70
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:18,502
Just a fucking kid! A baby!

71
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,799
What are we talking about here?
You lost your grandson?

72
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:27,302
What are you gonna do with
these fucking animals...

73
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:30,138
...these drug dealers?

74
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,391
He used to run around breaking balls.

75
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:34,768
Dominic.

76
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,686
My namesake.

77
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,773
Did you know about this?

78
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:45,153
What'd I say about this poison?
These kids shouldn't touch it!

79
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:50,617
I read the paper every day about
these poor pricks overdosing.

80
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,453
He didn't overdose, he killed himself.

81
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,539
Fourteen years old.

82
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,167
- Jesus!
- Was this at Patterson Falls?

83
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,462
Holy shit, that was your grandson?

84
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:06,007
- What?
- He took a designer drug.

85
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:09,052
Goes to the Falls, takes a header
right off the fence.

86
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:14,391
They said the current bashed his head
on rocks for days before he came up.

87
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:19,938
And meanwhile, this piece of shit...

88
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:25,193
...he gets to walk the streets and
sell more of this stuff to young kids.

89
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:27,070
Oh, really?

90
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:30,365
What's this motherless fuck's name?

91
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,415
- Even the coffee's old in here.
- How much can you complain?

92
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,917
Eventually, you've got a broken hip.

93
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:45,297
I want to give you a macchinetta.
It's the only way to get good coffee.

94
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,299
What are you wearing?

95
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,551
You smell like a French putain.

96
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,928
It's Canoe. Johnny wore Canoe.

97
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:54,681
Morning, Livia.

98
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,142
- Oh, good morning.
- Morning.

99
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,727
- Yeah, hi.
- New arrival?

100
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,812
Go ahead, keep moving, fella.

101
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,486
I'm happy for you, Junior.

102
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:11,406
I know how long you waited
to be made boss.

103
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,910
Just don't let certain people
take advantage of you...

104
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:16,578
...like they did to Johnny.

105
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,539
What certain people?
Nobody got over on Johnny.

106
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,917
Nobody's gonna get over on me.

107
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,712
How's your Jewish friend?

108
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,255
Hesh? What about him?

109
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:31,468
- Whoever heard of a Jew riding horses?
- He owns a horse farm.

110
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,763
He's Tony's friend, not mine.

111
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:39,559
- What have you got against him?
- Who, me? Nothing.

112
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,686
Johnny liked him.

113
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:47,108
And my son thinks every word that
comes out of his mouth is pure gold.

114
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:52,948
Are you telling me that since
I'm the new boss, I should tax Hesh?

115
00:08:57,286 --> 00:09:01,373
Boy, Anthony must've really gotten
under your collar. Admit it.

116
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:04,584
You want to crack his coglioni
for putting you in here.

117
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:08,171
- What are you talking about?
- Yeah.

118
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:11,466
And I'm playing shortstop
for the Mets.

119
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:15,303
All right, watch the balls!

120
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,734
What is the matter?

121
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,779
Tony's cannoli doesn't
want to stand up?

122
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,574
Tony's cannoli's tired.

123
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,118
But I can make it happen, baby.

124
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,744
I know.

125
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,997
Just, maybe...

126
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:46,876
So how's your job?

127
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,336
What?

128
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,213
Since when do you care?

129
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,507
Can't I be nice?

130
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:54,509
All right...

131
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:56,970
...forget it.

132
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,142
You don't want to talk? Fine.

133
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,520
Here, go with somebody
who gives a fuck.

134
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,355
I'm not a fucking whore!

135
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,983
Stick your money up your ass!

136
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:14,446
- I don't know what's wrong...
- There's nothing wrong with me!

137
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,698
Just wanted to talk, that's all!

138
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,909
Talking with you,
I might as well be a fucking dildo!

139
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:23,872
If you were a dildo,
we wouldn't be fighting.

140
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,374
What does that mean,
you fucking refugee?

141
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,209
What does that mean?

142
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,046
Come here.

143
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:35,634
Want to fight me? Knock you out!
You fucking communist cunt!

144
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:37,385
Hey, hey, hey!

145
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,349
Yeah, same to you!

146
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,478
You fucking burned me!

147
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,231
How you doing?

148
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,569
What do you got, Andrea?

149
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,996
- Clabby?
- Hearts.

150
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:07,165
Jump in, the water's warm.

151
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,377
Child's play. Pound a point.

152
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,509
- Hesh is outside.
- Tell him to come in.

153
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,970
He says he needs a word with you.

154
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,557
What the fuck?
You eat more queens than Lancelot.

155
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,524
What's up?

156
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,151
- Let's walk.
- That serious?

157
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:40,824
- You spoke to your uncle lately?
- Junior?

158
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,325
Yeah.

159
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:45,787
No. I don't know. Why, what's up?

160
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:49,791
- Your father was a fair man.
- What's that got to do with Junior?

161
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,668
Junior's not so fair.

162
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:55,630
Sometimes I wish you'd just get
to the point. What'd he do?

163
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,757
He's taxing me, Tony.

164
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,136
He's taxing you?
When did this happen?

165
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:02,303
Today.

166
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,764
Did you tell him you
operate without tax?

167
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,475
That my father loved you
and respected you?

168
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,979
That 10 cents of every dollar
in his kick is from you?

169
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:17,026
My uncle's boss of the family
10 minutes, already I got agita!

170
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:19,988
What'd you say?

171
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:23,575
It's a reasonable request
but an unreasonable figure.

172
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,952
What do you mean,
reasonable request?

173
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,829
He's the boss now, Tony.

174
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:31,583
He calls the tune, we dance to it.
That's the way it's done.

175
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:35,336
You can either respect that
or change the rules.

176
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:39,632
Tony, I came over here to tell you
with all this bullshit going on...

177
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,384
...I can't stay in this area.

178
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,094
Where you gonna go?

179
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,930
Come on.
I consider my royalty checks.

180
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,891
I wrote six gold records.

181
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,893
No, a couple of black kids did.

182
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:53,563
You just gave yourself a cowriting
credit. Come on, Heshie.

183
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,984
I know you. You leave this,
you're gonna kill yourself.

184
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:02,322
How much does he want?

185
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:05,909
500 large. Plus, two points
monthly on my shy.

186
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,663
All right.

187
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:15,877
Do me a favor, sit tight for now.
Let me think about it for a while.

188
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,563
How was that, baby?

189
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,982
The best.

190
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,943
You are the best.

191
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,113
Come here.

192
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:30,118
Tony, I love your cannoli.

193
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:33,621
You okay?

194
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,791
Yeah, I'm okay.

195
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,626
Go back to sleep.

196
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,133
Sure you're all right?

197
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:55,560
So, what do you want New York to do?

198
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,979
Junior can't know that we talked.

199
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,566
He's gotta think that Hesh came
to you on his own, by himself.

200
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,737
You are still running things.

201
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:10,491
The arrangement, whatever it is,
can't be insulting to my uncle.

202
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,827
Hesh has got to pay something.

203
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,121
I just haven't decided what.

204
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:24,464
I gotta get back. We'll talk later.

205
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:31,804
How's the veal?

206
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,640
It's like rubber.

207
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,516
Yeah?

208
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,648
Tastes all right to me.

209
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,067
Want something else?

210
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,085
Don't look at me.

211
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,629
Compliments of Johnny Sack.

212
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:13,137
Why don't you spend the rest
of our anniversary with him?

213
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,766
I was over there for 10
frigging minutes, Carmela.

214
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,644
- Don't do this.
- All right, Tony.

215
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,771
At least I know where I stand.

216
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,402
Why do you always gotta
be so dramatic?

217
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,654
Oh, here we go.

218
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:33,741
All right, I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry.

219
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,619
You don't even know what
you're apologizing for.

220
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,539
It's our anniversary, Tony.

221
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:42,709
Ours. Not yours, mine and
Johnny-fucking-Sack's.

222
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:44,544
Ours.

223
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:48,548
I thought we could get a room
at the Plaza like last year or...

224
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:50,591
I don't know. I don't...

225
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,602
I'm sorry, Carmela.

226
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:08,234
I just got a lot on my mind
and I'm not thinking straight.

227
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,196
Hey...

228
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:14,907
...I'm sorry.

229
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,747
Should I call the Plaza?

230
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:22,623
Come on.

231
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,960
No, let's go home.

232
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:39,515
Hey, come here.

233
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:42,852
Carm, what do you want me to say?

234
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,854
Tell me. I'm lost at sea here!

235
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:48,733
You've changed, Tony.
And I resent it.

236
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:53,279
It's destroying what little
self-esteem I have left.

237
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,364
Sometimes I think you skeeve me.

238
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,241
I skeeve you?

239
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:59,994
You're the mother of my children.
How could I?

240
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,371
You see what I'm talking about?
There.

241
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:07,794
"You're the mother of my children."
I'm just someone you procreated with.

242
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,963
You know it could be the Prozac.

243
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:15,176
Ginny Torrelli's been on it for years,
and she'd hump a fire hydrant.

244
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,845
Dr. Melfi said it had
different side effects.

245
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,640
Oh. She told you that?

246
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,991
Before we start today's session...

247
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,536
...we need to address the coffee.

248
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,873
It's not appropriate
of me to take gifts.

249
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,001
- It's a cup of coffee.
- Let's just make a rule, okay?

250
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,795
No gifts.

251
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,716
- Does this mean I can't drink mine?
- No.

252
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,094
Oh, I'm sorry.

253
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:03,349
I usually have my answering service on,
but I have a car emergency.

254
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:04,976
Yes?

255
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,105
What does that mean, "diagnostic"?

256
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,942
I just want to know what's
wrong with my car.

257
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,237
No. No, don't do anything.

258
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:19,198
No, I want to get a second opinion.

259
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:24,579
I'll take my chances. Thank you.

260
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,374
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

261
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,085
It's all right.

262
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:34,172
So how's it going?

263
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:35,423
Good.

264
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,133
Real good.

265
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,512
I think I may flush the medication,
you know?

266
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,973
See if the changes I'm feeling
are for real.

267
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:47,310
Why would you do that?
The Prozac seems to be working.

268
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,811
That might be the problem.

269
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:53,191
- It might be working overtime.
- What do you mean?

270
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:59,614
- I'm having a...
- Reaction?

271
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:03,201
You know, a side effect
from the stuff.

272
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,328
We talked about that.

273
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,206
Some people get insomnia.

274
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:11,792
Others, a stomachache or headaches.

275
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,336
But it usually passes.

276
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,797
But are there any other side effects
that you know of?

277
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:20,676
Some people experience
a diminished libido.

278
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:24,013
They have a hard time getting
or maintaining...

279
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:26,807
- Bingo!
- I see.

280
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:31,020
You know, not all impotence
is a result of the medication.

281
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:35,483
- There's something wrong with me?
- Have you had a prostate exam?

282
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:38,486
I don't even let anybody
wag their finger in my face.

283
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:43,991
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have laughed.

284
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,576
Don't apologize.

285
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:48,287
- Oh, boy.
- You got a nice laugh.

286
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:52,500
- All right, let's be serious.
- Hey. I'm serious.

287
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:59,006
You know that depression is also
a leading factor in impotence.

288
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:04,512
In the morning or at night
do you ever have an erection?

289
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,472
You could set your clock to it.

290
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,976
Okay, so we know it's not
a physical problem.

291
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,820
- Put that in after the credenza.
- Yes, ma'am.

292
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:24,782
What's going on?

293
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,867
Yeah, I bought some furniture.

294
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:30,246
Let's just move into Roche Bobois,
save the delivery charge.

295
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:31,706
Fine, I'll send it back.

296
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,792
No. But you've been spending
like a drunken sailor.

297
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,585
I said I'll send it back.

298
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,380
Mother of Christ,
I didn't say that, did I?

299
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,465
Jesus!

300
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:47,513
You shouldn't be telling my uncle
how to run things.

301
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:52,393
You think I got the balls to tell
your uncle how he should run things?

302
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:56,272
I shouldn't expect to see
the Statue of Liberty again if I did.

303
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,110
All right, look, Tony...

304
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:05,406
...Hesh isn't only a friend of
you guys, he's a friend of ours.

305
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:08,117
Somebody has to step in
so he doesn't get fucked.

306
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,161
I never said, "fucked."

307
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:15,082
You should've come to me first,
airing your dirty laundry in public.

308
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:18,794
How would it look if I went
to you after I spoke to him?

309
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,629
Now he's got a point.

310
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:22,590
Bottom line is...

311
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,426
...what are we gonna do?

312
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,808
You have a suggestion?

313
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:37,063
If there are any flies on you,
they're paying fucking rent.

314
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:43,611
500's a little steep
for back taxes, no?

315
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:49,200
The 2 percent of his action,
that's up to you. It affects Tony...

316
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,077
...as much as Hesh.

317
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,038
I'm not out to hurt anyone.

318
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:57,124
God forbid I get in the way
of someone earning.

319
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:01,587
One and a half on the shy business
and 300 on the back tax.

320
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:02,797
250.

321
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:12,139
Hold on to your cock when you
negotiate with these desert people.

322
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:16,477
250.

323
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,313
All right.

324
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,172
Mr. Soprano.

325
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,391
You want sex?

326
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:57,101
No.

327
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,646
Go back to sleep.

328
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:16,871
You know, you have a nice body.
You should make it work for you more.

329
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,497
Oh, really?

330
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:20,791
Yeah, you reveal too much.

331
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:23,294
You don't want other men
looking at me?

332
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:26,213
No, when you're not with me,
you do what you want.

333
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:31,260
But I'm saying maybe you could
wear a nice businesslike outfit.

334
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,304
I think I could get into that.

335
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,681
- You want me to dress like a man?
- No.

336
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:38,642
I don't want you to dress like a man.

337
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:42,730
I'm just saying maybe wear something
a little more professional.

338
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,315
Like you're in business.

339
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:47,735
- Well, fuck you, Tony. I'm no whore.
- No.

340
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:51,655
That's not what I mean, not like
you're in the whore business...

341
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,199
Oh, forget it.

342
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,204
Come here.

343
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,919
Is everyone in my life
bananas or what?

344
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,255
Get over here!

345
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,093
- Come...
- Go jerk off!

346
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,472
Yeah. Go jerk off.

347
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:19,058
Look at this. She burned me.

348
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,976
That's not good.

349
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,646
What led up to that?

350
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,689
Carmela can be pretty violent.

351
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,611
This added problem
that I've been having...

352
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:34,698
...I just thought we needed
to spice things up a little bit.

353
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:40,079
If it's not the Prozac, then maybe
I just need a little jump-start.

354
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:43,624
I suggested that maybe she dress
a little different.

355
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:46,293
- Something titillating?
- Yeah.

356
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,003
Maybe it'd help.

357
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:51,090
So I suggested to her...

358
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:52,633
...not demanded...

359
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:54,677
...suggested...

360
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:58,013
...you know, maybe dress
a little sexier.

361
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:03,227
- But Carmela can be very sensitive.
- Maybe she felt it degraded her.

362
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:05,980
Not all women are into sexy lingerie.

363
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:08,274
It's not about dressing like that.

364
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,192
Then what are we talking about?

365
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:14,405
Some women are sexier when
they dress simple.

366
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,740
You know, understated.

367
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,660
And I don't mean...

368
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:25,666
Fuck it, I don't know what I mean.

369
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,547
Like you.

370
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:33,757
How like me?

371
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,467
You play it down.

372
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:42,600
Now, it's obvious you got
a killer body under there.

373
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:43,892
Don't get me wrong.

374
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:48,022
- All right.
- Not only do you play it down...

375
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,443
...but you're gentle.

376
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,070
Not loud.

377
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,406
Sweet-sounding.

378
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,701
Like a mandolin.

379
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,542
Anthony.

380
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,011
Unfortunately,
we have to stop now.

381
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:22,222
I think it's important
that we talk about this.

382
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:25,559
Do you think you could come back
later this afternoon?

383
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:27,895
No.

384
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,567
Till Tuesday.

385
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,236
Okay?

386
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,369
Yeah, all right.

387
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,246
See you Tuesday.

388
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:56,108
It's the oddest thing.
I've had this problem for weeks.

389
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:59,820
But this morning, I get in
and it starts right up.

390
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:01,739
And then again at the deli.

391
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:03,490
Looks fine.

392
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,785
Are you sure?
I was told I need a new starter.

393
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:09,747
Lady...

394
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:15,252
...as much as I might wish to rob you,
I won't try to replace a new starter.

395
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,337
- What do you mean, "new"?
- New.

396
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:20,257
It has everything but
the price tag hanging from it.

397
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:28,766
I didn't do nothing!

398
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:31,852
Poor kid committed suicide
up here because of you.

399
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,062
- You fucking know me!
- I know you.

400
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:40,527
Listen, big boy. Listen to me,
I'm gonna give you a break.

401
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,947
I'm gonna give you a break.
When I toss you over...

402
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:48,952
...when I toss you over, if you fly,
I won't shoot you down. Deal?

403
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:50,370
No!

404
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,872
No!

405
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:17,606
Well, my goodness.

406
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,068
What happened here?

407
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,614
Some sad shit.

408
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,575
Motherfucker said he didn't
want to live no more.

409
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:30,619
Jumped.

410
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,628
How much you give him?

411
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:56,478
I thought I was the only one Junior
could make look like that.

412
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,276
All right, let me hear it.

413
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,612
Rusty Irish.

414
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,406
What about him?

415
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:08,991
Took a header off the Falls.

416
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:11,910
It's the closest that junkie
ever got to a bath.

417
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:15,247
I got news for you. That
junkie was my biggest earner.

418
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:19,960
He moved more cards than 10 guys
put together. And another thing:

419
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:23,714
He should've checked with me
before he did a favor for Capri.

420
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:26,633
You're losing me.

421
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:29,136
Irish sold Capri's grandson that shit.

422
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:33,807
- You created a Frankenstein in Junior.
- I created?

423
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:36,935
We agreed to let Junior have his day.

424
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:41,106
"Let him be the lightning rod,
and when somebody goes down...

425
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:44,234
...he's not a young man with a family."
We agreed.

426
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:47,279
We agreed, but who expected
to get raped?

427
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:51,658
When Jackie was boss, it all
evened out at the end of the day.

428
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:54,494
But your uncle, Madonna,
does he eat alone!

429
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:56,830
He doesn't even pass the salt.

430
00:31:57,832 --> 00:32:02,502
What about Sammy Grigio's card game?
Mikey beat him up. That ain't right.

431
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:05,255
Even a broken clock is right
twice a day.

432
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:09,009
Junior had a position.
That game wasn't paying anybody.

433
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:13,388
The minute Sammy Grigio used Jimmy's
name, it should've been end of story.

434
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,182
That's right.

435
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:21,313
- What do you want me to do?
- We made our bed, we sleep in it.

436
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:24,399
How long will we kick upstairs
without it hurting?

437
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,444
Something, anything should
trickle down over here, no?

438
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:31,198
All we want you to do is talk to him.

439
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:33,909
After all, he's your uncle. Come on.

440
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:35,535
That's right.

441
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:51,301
- Who is it?
- It's me, Ma.

442
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:54,221
- Who?
- Anthony.

443
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,556
Open the door.

444
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:06,108
I thought it was the Activities lady.
She's a real pain in the ass.

445
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,985
Playing bingo, Livia?

446
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,237
Oh, not tonight, honey.

447
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:12,864
You know, she's a degenerate gambler.

448
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:15,450
Milly. Milly?

449
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:17,577
My son.

450
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:20,038
Handsome.

451
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,758
So how's it going?

452
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:34,219
Oh, what can I say?

453
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,013
Hey, this is great!

454
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:39,850
You only need that broken reading lamp
you had by the phone at home.

455
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:41,476
And I got it downstairs.
I can bring it.

456
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:43,812
Listen!

457
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,273
Oh, she's driving me crazy!

458
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,859
- Who?
- Next door!

459
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,485
There it is again.

460
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:56,783
That's enough water!
How much water does she need?

461
00:33:57,035 --> 00:34:01,705
She runs the water all day.
Water, water, water!

462
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:04,791
I'm living next door to Gunga Din!

463
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,961
I went to Ferrara's.
I got you biscotti.

464
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:09,379
- Almonds?
- Yeah.

465
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,757
All right. Leave them there.

466
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:15,218
I'll take them downstairs
later for my coffee.

467
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:21,933
Uncle Jun been by?

468
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:27,189
Oh, once in a while.
It makes him uncomfortable here.

469
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:31,818
He's got a lot on his mind. More
responsibilities means more headaches.

470
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,446
Better men than him had to work hard.

471
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:35,614
Yeah?

472
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:37,657
He'll be all right.

473
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,619
If he remembers who his friends are.

474
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:46,500
I'd hate to see him mess up.
He's been waiting a long time.

475
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:47,876
What do you mean?

476
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:51,671
It's not a business that
forgives bad decisions.

477
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:54,883
And I hate to see him making
wrong moves, you know.

478
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:59,763
- Especially at the beginning.
- Why you telling me? Tell him.

479
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,807
Ma, you got his ear.

480
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,101
He listens to you.

481
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,645
I don't know that world.

482
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:08,605
No, of course not.

483
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:12,526
But if anything, you know,
were to come up, that's all.

484
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,569
I don't want to get involved.

485
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:18,240
If you have something to say to
your uncle, bring it up to him.

486
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:24,955
- Oh, I wish the Lord would take me.
- Come on, Ma.

487
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:29,334
There's plenty of nice gents
that want a date with you.

488
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,336
Look. I'm going downstairs.

489
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:36,341
I'm going downstairs before that
che brutta Activities lady finds me.

490
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:38,260
You want coffee?

491
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:41,012
- Yeah, all right.
- Bring the cookies!

492
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:46,226
Carmela, I don't want to sound
like religion is a cure-all...

493
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:49,604
...but if Tony got more
involved with the Church...

494
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:53,066
...it may help to expedite things
in his therapy.

495
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:56,862
What's killing me is that
this is a self-inflicted wound.

496
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,697
I pushed for it.

497
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:02,409
I could deal with the goomars.
I knew I was better than them.

498
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:08,039
As stupid as it sounds, I viewed them
as a form of masturbation for him.

499
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:11,168
I couldn't give him what
he needed all the time.

500
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:14,337
You're a man.
You know that thirst.

501
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:20,135
I was too busy with the house
and the kids to quench it.

502
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,306
But this psychiatrist...

503
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:27,225
...you know, she's not just a goomar.

504
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:32,856
Now I feel like he's really cheating
and I'm the one who's thirsty.

505
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:36,610
I'm not gonna stay in a marriage
that's made...

506
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:39,946
Let's not even think about that.

507
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:45,952
Divorce is for those who never intended
on dying married in the first place.

508
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:51,750
You know, Carm, we reap what we sow.

509
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:54,169
What do you mean?

510
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,380
You admit to accepting
his dalliances in the past.

511
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,633
Schifosas.
They meant nothing.

512
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:04,763
But you said it was like they were
"lightening the workload"...

513
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:08,558
...providing a wife's duty
when you were too busy.

514
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:11,102
You practically welcomed it.

515
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,440
Now, I want you to pray...

516
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:20,445
...to our Holy Mother, ask her
for guidance and forgiveness...

517
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:23,990
...so that you can get through
this as a couple.

518
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,995
You're not without sin
in this, Carmela.

519
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,374
So she's out of control.

520
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:36,002
She spends money like we're
the Sopranos of Park Avenue.

521
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:39,506
But you've noticed her.
Which may have been the point.

522
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:45,053
Look, before we run out of time...

523
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:49,641
...I'd like to discuss what happened
when we were here last week.

524
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:55,272
How's your car?

525
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:00,193
Did you steal my car
and have it fixed?

526
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:07,158
- We had an agreement, no gifts.
- I didn't want you to get robbed.

527
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:08,743
It was you.

528
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:12,956
You had no right to steal my car.

529
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:15,792
I've been scared to death.

530
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:17,377
- Why?
- Why?

531
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:21,047
It's a violation of my privacy.
What else have you done?

532
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:26,594
Answer me.

533
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:31,391
I love you.

534
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:34,019
- Anthony.
- I'm in love with you.

535
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:38,064
I'm sorry. It's just the way it is.

536
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:40,066
- Okay. Let me talk.
- No.

537
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:42,235
It's not the Prozac.

538
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:45,822
I dream about you.

539
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,742
I think about you all the time.

540
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:51,077
I can't get excited about
other women.

541
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,372
There's nothing else to say.

542
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,126
I love you.

543
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:00,128
Let me start here.

544
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:03,465
I know this may be very hard
for you to swallow.

545
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:08,094
But you're only feeling this way
because we've made such progress.

546
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:11,431
- What?
- I've been gentle. That's my job.

547
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,769
I listen. That's what I do best.

548
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:19,105
I've been a broad, generic,
sympathetic woman to you...

549
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:22,233
...because that's what
this work calls for.

550
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:28,823
You've made me all of the things
you feel are missing in your wife.

551
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:31,618
And in your mother.

552
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:42,462
You're making me out to be
some fucking mama's boy.

553
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:44,547
I'm a man.

554
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:46,841
And you're a woman.

555
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:49,135
End of story.

556
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:52,931
And this crap about Freud and...

557
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:57,477
...every boy wanting to have sex with
his mother, that's not gonna fly here.

558
00:39:57,853 --> 00:39:59,979
I didn't say that.

559
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:02,941
I want to make sure
we understand each other.

560
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,402
Yeah, we understand each other.

561
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:09,989
You don't love me.

562
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:17,247
You don't want me
to come back anymore.

563
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,499
It's quite the opposite.

564
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,545
This is all a byproduct of progress.

565
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,672
Has someone been following me?

566
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,676
Okay, forget it.

567
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,221
I'll see you next week.

568
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:45,400
All right, let's go!

569
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:48,695
- Listen, Uncle Junior...
- You could've made the pros.

570
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:52,240
You could've done it.
You had a swing like Joe D.

571
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,825
- You're crazy.
- What?

572
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:55,577
You think I'm shitting you?

573
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,913
- I could barely hit.250.
- Because you didn't want it.

574
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:02,834
Too busy chasing skirt.
Chasing skirt, your average was.500.

575
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:06,546
- Yeah, what happened?
- What did you want to talk about?

576
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:09,215
Octavian.

577
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:14,053
- You know, Augustus.
- You fucking with me?

578
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:17,557
No. Octavian became Augustus.

579
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:21,561
Forget about that.

580
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:26,232
Bottom line: Augustus was a Caesar.
And everybody loved him, right?

581
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:30,236
- You know why?
- I don't know that I give a fuck.

582
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:34,491
Everybody loved him because
he never ate alone. Capisci?

583
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,452
It was the longest time of peace
in Rome's history.

584
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:41,414
He was a fair leader and all
his people loved him for that.

585
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:44,250
Is this the one that
they stabbed in the back?

586
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,086
No, that was Julius.
Talking about Augustus.

587
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:50,590
He shared his wealth and
all his people loved him.

588
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:52,634
You said that three times.

589
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:56,095
I heard it. His people loved him.
What's your point?

590
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:02,519
Remember when you told me
about the bull and his son?

591
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:05,939
They're looking out
at a bunch of cows.

592
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:10,318
The son says, "Dad, why don't we
run down and fuck one of these cows?"

593
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:11,861
What did the dad say?

594
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:17,408
The father says, "Son, why don't we
walk down there and fuck them all?"

595
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:22,205
I told you that?
"Why don't we fuck them all."

596
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:23,831
That's funny.

597
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:27,335
Okay, I get your point.

598
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:30,755
Why all of this fucking
Augustus-Octavian shit?

599
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:32,340
I don't know.

600
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:36,594
Are you okay? You've been
acting mezzo morto lately.

601
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:39,097
I ain't seen you like that for years.

602
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:43,977
I'm okay. It's just bullshit stuff.
Don't worry about it.

603
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:47,647
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm okay.

604
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:55,405
Junior took your 250 and
split it amongst the top five guys.

605
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,282
So he doesn't look greedy.

606
00:42:57,491 --> 00:42:58,658
- Smart move.
- Yeah.

607
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:01,202
Your uncle may be another
Harry Truman.

608
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:04,163
- What's that mean?
- Truman had a big job thrust on him.

609
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:08,626
He didn't want it, but in the end
he made some pretty wise decisions.

610
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:11,170
Your uncle may be the right man.

611
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:14,382
I fucking hope so.

612
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:16,634
I'll tell you, I don't want the job.

613
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:18,636
Let Junior die from the stress.

614
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,181
That's what gave Jackie the cancer,
God rest his soul.

615
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,851
"Boss." Fuck it, who needs it?

616
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:37,196
It's nice here.

617
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:40,742
I can't stand the smell.
The shit, flies all over.

618
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:44,954
But I could watch them for hours.
There's a kind of beauty to it.

619
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:46,205
I envy them.

620
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,625
- I wouldn't go that far.
- I would.

621
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:53,713
They got no bills, no headaches,
no family cazzi running around.

622
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:56,549
One horse likes another one,
they fuck. That's it.

623
00:43:56,759 --> 00:44:00,261
No problems. No hundred questions.
No guilt.

624
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,683
I don't know what I'm talking about.

625
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,895
So Junior split my money
and spread it around?

626
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:12,690
- Yeah.
- Five bosses, 50 a pop.

627
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:13,983
Not a bad day's pay.

628
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:18,404
Still, I wish it wasn't your money.

629
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,908
You know, it makes me feel terrible.

630
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:25,912
What?

631
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:31,334
You old fucking Jew.

632
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:34,754
Here's my share.
I don't want to profit off you.

633
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:40,927
Never entered my mind.

634
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:04,033
Dr. Melfi, there's nothing there,
you know.

635
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:06,577
You don't have to explain
nothing, Tony.

636
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:14,293
In psychiatry, apparently what you're
feeling is not what you're feeling.

637
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:17,296
And what you're not feeling
is your real agenda.

638
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:34,689
- You're gonna stick with it, right?
- I don't know.

639
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:36,816
I think you should.

640
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:38,484
You do?

641
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:43,865
I was jealous.

642
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:46,993
- I should've...
- Wait, let me finish, Tony.

643
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:51,622
I've been thinking a lot about this.

644
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:57,003
I was jealous of her ability
to help you.

645
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:01,382
To be a sort of salvation to you.

646
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,843
I talked to Father Phil and...

647
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:08,014
...I want to be that woman
in your life.

648
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:17,482
Carm, you're not just in my life...

649
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:20,526
...you are my life.

650
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:26,657
Come here.

651
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:46,886
I'm no good at speeches.

652
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:50,056
Owe him a dime,
you'll hear some great speeches.

653
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:53,226
Shit. Shut up, let me talk.

654
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:55,228
Go ahead. I was only kidding.

655
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:58,397
I'd like everybody
to raise their glasses.

656
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:09,742
Okay.

657
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:15,540
Taught me as much as anybody,
except for maybe my father.

658
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:20,211
Even if he wasn't my uncle...

659
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,381
...I'd be standing here saying:

660
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:25,174
"To our new boss."

661
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,760
Salute.

662
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:31,931
To Junior.

663
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:34,183
Junior.

664
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:37,353
To Junior.

665
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:39,397
Salute.
