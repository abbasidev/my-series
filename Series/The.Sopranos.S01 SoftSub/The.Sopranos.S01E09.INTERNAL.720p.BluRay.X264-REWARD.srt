1
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:41,016
Come on! Come on, dog!
Come on!

2
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:42,851
Come on! Come on.

3
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:49,441
Look at this!
Look at this plastic!

4
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,360
And there's weeds!

5
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,612
Well, it looks like Tobacco Road.

6
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,406
- Nobody gets down here.
- Anthony!

7
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,201
Those dogs are wild dogs.

8
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,203
Cemetery dogs.

9
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,330
They'll take your hand off.

10
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,334
Come over here. Say a Hail Mary
for your grandfather.

11
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:08,794
Lay off. He's a kid.

12
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:12,464
So he should neglect his elders?
Just like his father.

13
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:14,383
Yeah, a real skimp.

14
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:15,717
My son.

15
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:18,554
The mental patient.

16
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:22,474
Remember those trips to the Shore?
Me and Tony rode the waves?

17
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,101
I taught him to bodysurf.

18
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:27,020
My son was brought up right.

19
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,606
He needs a psychiatrist for what?

20
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:32,025
- To talk about his sex life?
- Enough.

21
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:34,194
I hate it as much as you do.

22
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:35,571
Anthony!

23
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,574
Those dogs could start
foaming at the mouth.

24
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:42,286
How come you're not supposed
to breathe in the cemetery?

25
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,122
- Who says?
- It's a joke. Say, "Why?"

26
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,499
You'll make the dead people jealous.

27
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,589
Okay, come pick it up! Pick it up.

28
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:56,049
Who's got the ball?!

29
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,593
Oh, my God! Look out!

30
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,761
Come around, come around!

31
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:02,556
Up, up, up! Cover them through!

32
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:04,057
I can't watch.

33
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:06,101
Yes!

34
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:10,189
Way to go, Meadow!
You're a brick wall, baby! Brick wall!

35
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,941
Good save!
Come on, now. Come on!

36
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,068
That was close.

37
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:18,780
- Pretty good.
- Look at you. At girls' soccer, Tony.

38
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,533
What do you want?
My son's a couch potato.

39
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:24,161
- Red! Five!
- Are you yellow-card happy?

40
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,580
Rough play, my ass!

41
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,460
- Hi, honey.
- Go get them, baby.

42
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,796
This fat kid is such a sneak
with that elbow!

43
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:38,467
Coach says next year,
Chiara is gonna be one of his starts.

44
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,594
Let's pull it out, for chrissake!

45
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:43,555
Heather Dante!
A hundred bucks for a goal!

46
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,309
What's with Ally today?
She's sleepwalking out there.

47
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:51,813
She eats at our house a lot.
She's got the energy.

48
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:54,733
That tackle was our ball, asshole!

49
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,610
Zebra, I'm talking to you.

50
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,447
Blow that again,
I'll stick it up your ass!

51
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,868
Get off the field now, or your team
is gonna forfeit the game!

52
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:07,329
I'm going.
You fucking son of a...

53
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,164
Get off the field!

54
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,711
Did a hell of a job.

55
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,841
Falcons! Falcons, heads up!

56
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:23,178
Red, 42! 42!

57
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,347
Push! Ally!

58
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,474
Come on.

59
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,395
Come on, Al!

60
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:58,714
Did I tell you?
What did I tell you?

61
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:01,925
He's a brilliant coach.
A beautiful, brilliant genius.

62
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,635
You in love with him?

63
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:08,473
Yes. If he steers Chiara to a college
scholarship, I'll blow the guy.

64
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,058
You will?

65
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:13,812
How's chefing at Dimples?

66
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:18,608
Try the salad bar. We got a chemical
brightener. It keeps lettuce crisp.

67
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,944
- How nice.
- Yeah, it's beautiful.

68
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:24,239
The offer's still there.
You put some out on the street...

69
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,909
...at two points,
we split the interest. Nice?

70
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,998
I can't do the math.
I'm an artiste.

71
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,250
Get out of here.

72
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:38,628
Good job, girls!

73
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:52,100
- Absolutely.
- And you do that so well, coach.

74
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,686
- Thanks.
- The psychology is important.

75
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:55,979
Did a hell of a job.

76
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,316
Welcome to Bada Bing.
Everything's on the house.

77
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,026
Come meet somebody.

78
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,528
- He coached college.
- Get out of here.

79
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:06,823
- Division 1-A.
- No, that's boonie state.

80
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:10,952
Besides, it's time to stop moving
my wife and Deena like pawns...

81
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,829
...when someone ups the ante.

82
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:17,042
Anyway, how many chances does a man
get to coach his own daughter?

83
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:19,586
- Money isn't everything.
- Here, here.

84
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,129
The kids are important.

85
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,758
Cheers. To the Falcons.
Continued success.

86
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:33,558
Brandy, why don't you give the coach
a deluxe tour of the VIP lounge.

87
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:36,186
- What?
- Oh, guys.

88
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:38,605
Jesus, we said a beer.

89
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:43,026
No, I...
Thank you, but I don't think so.

90
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,655
Jesus Christ.

91
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,658
Okay, Brandy, go sit on a tuffet.

92
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,245
Coach, it's on the house.

93
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,874
- Why are you here?
- Who's he?

94
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,043
My girl's coach. You got something?

95
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:03,004
Every car you see in the
rear-view mirror is not a fed.

96
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:06,007
Mikey Palmice went and got
a major Manhattan PI.

97
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:10,178
Mikey thinks someone here rats for
the government. What else is new?

98
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:14,599
What else? My colleague over at
Organized Crime Task Force...

99
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:18,562
...gets chatty after caffeine drinks.

100
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:22,691
Names of people whose fiscal interests
intersect with your own.

101
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:27,487
I'm still trying to find out
if you've been named.

102
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:31,783
But these people are keeping
these indictments very, very internal.

103
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,578
They may have a folder
with my name on it.

104
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,580
If I was smart,
I wouldn't be here.

105
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:37,831
I rest my case.

106
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,250
I'm up the street
on a rape-homicide.

107
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:44,087
What I need now is to see
a liquor license, if you don't mind.

108
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:48,258
So anybody wonders why I was here
or for the lie detector test...

109
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:51,511
Cha-cha, show him the liquor license.

110
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,263
Don't touch the girls.

111
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,224
How you doing?

112
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:59,436
Bada Bing. Arthur Bucco!

113
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,232
Hello?

114
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,735
You gonna stay in that bar all day?

115
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:10,071
- I'm shooting pool.
- I'll rack them up for you.

116
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,325
I thought we were supposed to
paint the patio.

117
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,452
I bought primer
and I've been scraping.

118
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:16,912
You have?

119
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:19,247
I could really use your help.

120
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,583
All right. I'll be right home.

121
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,380
This fucking guy lays down the law.

122
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,133
Fucking blistering.
"I'll be right home."

123
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:33,428
I gotta get home too.
Shelley'll be looking for me.

124
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,764
It's quite the lifestyle
you got here.

125
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,682
- See ya later, coach.
- Okay.

126
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,143
Different strokes.

127
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:44,564
Melvoin, Perlov,
Schneider and Archide.

128
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:51,154
- What's with the indictments?
- Put it right down there.

129
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:55,283
The book is off on the 14th ward.

130
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:59,538
I don't want to minimize your position.
Two prior convictions.

131
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:03,500
You're in jeopardy of sentence
under the habitual offenders statute.

132
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:07,003
I'm paying you to hear shit
that's eating my insides?

133
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,255
Peppers and eggs?

134
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:11,424
Peppers and eggs?
That's what I should've had.

135
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,349
"I'd be happy to surrender
Mr. Soprano.

136
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:22,310
You can be assured
of my full cooperation."

137
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,480
You'd rather they kicked in
your front door at night?

138
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,732
It's a target letter, Corrado.

139
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:31,152
I got nowhere, so I asked them
what your status was.

140
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,240
Just testing.
So what'd they say?

141
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,033
They'd let me know.

142
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,452
I may just start paying taxes.

143
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,538
God, it's a fucking burn.

144
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:45,333
I'm sick and tired of sitting around.
I'm gonna get out of here.

145
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:46,876
With your lady friend?

146
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,587
What do you know about her?

147
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,339
Works for the Joint Fitters Union,
right?

148
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:56,511
Runs their labor management fund
outside the feds' oversight.

149
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:01,057
If you can't get your friends jobs,
why attain success?

150
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:03,310
The wheels of justice turn slowly.

151
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,771
Take her to Florida. Develop a tan.

152
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,607
Where's the crapper key?

153
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:10,609
Top right-hand drawer.

154
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:16,364
Junior, we're working out of a fucking
lawyer's office, is that right?

155
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:20,910
Look, I didn't want to say anything,
but this government case...

156
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,955
...if there's a leak,
it's in Tony's boat.

157
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:28,877
If my nephew's in bed with
the Justice Department, just say it.

158
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,879
Don't stammer like a spastic.

159
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:35,008
There's something fucking wrong with
that guy. I feel it in my gut.

160
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,636
I'm worried about you, skipper.

161
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,513
I'm sorry, Mikey. You're a good boy.

162
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,642
Fuck this. I'm going to Boca.

163
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,896
Deena, when you guys
showed up last year...

164
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,774
...I thought,
"Soccer, give me a break."

165
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:54,736
But your dad makes it seem like
this, I don't know, metaphor.

166
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,571
- Yeah.
- Dad's pretty cool.

167
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,741
Where's Al? She was supposed
to loan me a cig.

168
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,534
I'll come with.

169
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:03,912
Al?

170
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:05,205
Ally!

171
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,083
Al!

172
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,920
If you're smoking,
you owe me $5!

173
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,924
- AI?
- Ally.

174
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:19,594
Ally?

175
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,140
Ally, what are you doing?

176
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,101
Ally! Oh, my God!

177
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:31,481
Her parents split up.

178
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,109
So she's always at our house.

179
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:38,321
- But she was born with a silver spoon.
- Teenagers are under a lot of stress.

180
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,990
I know this kid. She's great.

181
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:45,704
Was it a genuine suicide attempt?
Or was it a suicidal gesture?

182
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,290
"Small cutting" is the clinical term.

183
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,626
Is "large cutting"
O.J. in missing sweats?

184
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,712
It's a cry for help.

185
00:11:56,632 --> 00:12:00,301
Her mother says she tried this before.

186
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,429
A couple times.

187
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,141
What else is going on?

188
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,476
Life is putting the Prozac
to the test.

189
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,020
It's all that business in the news?

190
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,981
Let's talk about my daughter.

191
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,651
Principal says girls in sports
do better.

192
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:19,320
They don't take drugs
or get knocked up.

193
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,406
But now this shit.

194
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:24,492
If my daughter ever tried to
kill herself...

195
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,914
Oh, God!

196
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,469
Last week, I called you a whore.

197
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,345
I might've been...

198
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:47,849
...overstating the case a little bit.

199
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:54,814
Ooh.

200
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,232
Mr. Soprano.

201
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:57,734
Miss Sanfillipo.

202
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,486
A check for you to sign.

203
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,197
Twenty grand?

204
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:06,284
For research and development
into furthering the art and science...

205
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,495
...of metal joint fittings.

206
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,998
Where does our research
and development take us this time?

207
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,501
Well, I was thinking Boca Raton.

208
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,377
My, my! You read my mind.

209
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:17,962
I'm all packed.

210
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,381
I gotta talk to my cousin.

211
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:22,884
- Mr. Soprano?
- What?

212
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:27,055
I was waiting to talk to Jerry
about how I could use some room...

213
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:29,516
...on this mall job I got
in North Bergen.

214
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:32,685
Then I saw you here.
And I thought, what the hell...

215
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,396
...I may as well ask the man himself.

216
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:40,276
Let's you and I meet. I can pass
my recommends on to my cousin.

217
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,406
Mama Livia, how are you?

218
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:49,828
- Do you remember me? Larry Boy Barese.
- I know who you are.

219
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:53,706
You lit an apartment house on fire...

220
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:57,293
...and scared your mother
half to death.

221
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,671
Mama's moving in here on the 15th.

222
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,340
Yeah? Ooh, I like your shoes.

223
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:06,261
Mama hasn't been well. Last week
she threw a jar of artichokes at me.

224
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:09,013
She better not throw any
artichokes at me.

225
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,058
How are you doing? Remember Larry?

226
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,018
Water under the bridge.

227
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,563
We're gonna take a walk.

228
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:19,607
You should get some shoes like his.

229
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:24,821
You've always been a genius.
But this last move is the best.

230
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,490
The feds'll never surveil
an old folks' home.

231
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,286
That's why I got truckloads
of bootleg Polident coming in.

232
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,454
- There he is.
- How you doing?

233
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,790
Did you get your mother
settled in yet?

234
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:40,128
They're not sure they can accept her.
They want to see my finances again.

235
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:44,299
So this office supply chain from
Virginia. What's the deal on them?

236
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:48,720
I spoke to them. I think they'll
listen to reason on minority hiring.

237
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,974
- Been to any games?
- What do they got?

238
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,153
What the fuck?

239
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,615
Hup! Hup! Hup!

240
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,952
Knees high, Colgiavani!

241
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:16,497
Eyes ahead!
Energy, girls, energy!

242
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:20,585
I know we're all upset,
but we still have a season left.

243
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,962
- Come on, let's go!
- Hey, coach.

244
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:26,049
Fellas, sorry, but practice
is closed today.

245
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,176
I'm trying to keep
the team focused.

246
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:30,261
What are you doing?

247
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:34,057
You're leaving us?
After two fucking years?

248
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:37,810
I told that reporter to wait
before he put that in the paper.

249
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:41,272
Coach, look at my little girl
out there.

250
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,441
You're breaking her heart!

251
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:47,528
Believe me, Art.
I am hugely conflicted.

252
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:50,031
But Rhode Island doubled my salary!

253
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,993
They're giving my daughter a full ride!
What could I do?

254
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,287
They made an offer I couldn't refuse.

255
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,623
- You haven't heard ours.
- Come on.

256
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,667
Look, I got a family too.

257
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:03,378
I have a daughter who loves
playing soccer.

258
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:05,254
He's kidding about the offer.

259
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:09,425
Hey, nobody blew a whistle!

260
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:12,261
Let's not get lazy out here!
Come on!

261
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,389
Go fuck yourself.

262
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,057
Excuse me?

263
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,559
- Want me to tell your dad?
- It's my field.

264
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,856
Give me 10 laps around the goals.

265
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,817
- Whatever.
- Make that 20.

266
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,403
Anybody else want to mouth off?

267
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,825
Good! Come on!
Let's circle up for keep-away.

268
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,410
Let's go! Over here.

269
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:38,287
Get in a big circle!
Go! Move it!

270
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:42,792
I need some people out here.
Come on! Let's go!

271
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:57,265
Give me your glass.

272
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,729
Who'd think we could be
this contented?

273
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:06,649
I did. As soon as I
saw you, I knew.

274
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:09,235
You're a sweetheart.

275
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:13,156
If only they knew
the other side of you.

276
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,408
They'd eat me for breakfast.

277
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,996
I been looking at real estate.
Some nice houses on the market.

278
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,248
Maybe you'd like something bigger?

279
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:26,169
No, Corrado. This is our place.

280
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,838
You know how long we been
coming here?

281
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:32,175
Sixteen years.
And every one of them good.

282
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:36,054
How's junior, Junior?

283
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,642
He's catching some shuteye.

284
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:44,645
You're such a powerhouse.

285
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,648
When you kiss me down there...

286
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:50,318
...you're like a great artist.

287
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:53,863
You got a real instinct for it.

288
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,033
Pass me the red peppers.

289
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:11,047
You know the thrill you give?

290
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,009
Keep it to yourself, okay?

291
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:18,846
Yeah. All to myself.

292
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:30,399
- Corrado?
- Yeah?

293
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,527
Why the big secret?

294
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,195
About what?

295
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,697
Oral sex.

296
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:41,035
What's so terrible about
pleasing a woman?

297
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,205
You always have to talk about it.

298
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,874
Well, I want to know why!

299
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,584
It's complicated.

300
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,754
Yeah. But why?

301
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:53,756
Why?

302
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:57,093
They think if you suck pussy,
you'll suck anything.

303
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,594
You're kidding.

304
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:02,640
It's a sign of weakness. And possibly
a sign that you're a finocchio.

305
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,185
A fag?

306
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,896
That's ridiculous.

307
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:13,234
How would the two even translate?

308
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:18,447
What are you gonna do?
I don't make the rules.

309
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:23,578
It's no big lifestyle choice.

310
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:27,999
My aunts Quintima and Jemma, they got
money out earning on the street.

311
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,918
It's like being a banker.
You help people.

312
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:37,049
Chiara cried when she heard
the coach was leaving.

313
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,801
You don't want to talk. Fine.

314
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,596
I gotta pick up Carmela anyway.

315
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:45,683
Let me ask you a question:
Why does your wife hate me?

316
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,602
Charmaine doesn't hate you.

317
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,274
You lie like I play a horn.

318
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:54,901
What?

319
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:01,449
Look at this facchino.
Wearing a cap in a nice restaurant.

320
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:08,456
I hated that most when I had
my restaurant. It's values today.

321
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,375
Standards are crumbling.

322
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:16,923
Would it kill this coach to
stay until my kid graduates?

323
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:19,592
Then let him stay four years
for Chiara.

324
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,140
That burns my ass.

325
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:29,602
Where you going?

326
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,984
Take your hat off.

327
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,319
Excuse me?

328
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:41,656
They don't sell hot dogs.
They took the bleachers out.

329
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,908
I'll wear it where I want.

330
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,176
How you doing?

331
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,897
Thank you.

332
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,607
Look at him.

333
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,402
Douche bag. Good for you!

334
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,864
Send them a bottle
of Montepulciano.

335
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:27,702
Get the license plate of these
two guys sitting behind Artie.

336
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,996
They look like cops.

337
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:49,890
Well, look who's here! Hi!

338
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,729
- Tony, look who's here.
- Alphonse, how you doing?

339
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,647
- Good.
- You feeling better?

340
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:57,857
Yeah.

341
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:03,195
Gonna miss that left foot of yours.

342
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,448
No. It's okay, Mr. Soprano.

343
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,366
- I'm gonna play.
- No shit?

344
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,160
Pardon my French there.

345
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,828
Are you sure, Ally?

346
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:14,874
I had a long talk
with Coach Hauser and...

347
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,628
I'm gonna play. That's all.

348
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,714
I told her she didn't have to.

349
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,716
She just said she wanted to.

350
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,594
Yeah.

351
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,388
- Coach pressure you?
- No, Mrs. Soprano.

352
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:30,973
He would never do that.

353
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:33,934
Pressure her? He doesn't
finish what he started.

354
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:35,603
- Dad!
- What?

355
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,273
It's what we all wanted.

356
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,944
Okay. Right?

357
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:45,613
As long as everything's...

358
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,282
We're trying to watch this, okay?

359
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:51,410
Kick ass, girls, right?

360
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,287
Good night.

361
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:18,020
Listen, Roberta,
what I said earlier?

362
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:23,818
I'm serious, you discuss that
with anyone, we're gonna go 10 rounds.

363
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:26,779
We just skimmed 20,000
off the development fund...

364
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,782
...and you're worried about
a little lecca fica?

365
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:32,576
- Will you keep it down?
- All right.

366
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:36,997
I'll tell everyone you're a good
kisser. I just won't say where.

367
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:40,000
That's my reputation you're
playing with.

368
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,629
Honey, my lips are sealed.

369
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:46,799
Not too sealed, right?

370
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:52,805
Visual on Corrado Soprano
and female travel companion...

371
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:56,517
...2200 hours, Boca Lounge.

372
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,075
How's my boy today?

373
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:14,869
Go, go, go!

374
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,665
I'm looking for a Coach Hauser.

375
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,668
That's me.
Petey! Come here!

376
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:26,755
Something from your friends
at the Bada Bing.

377
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:31,427
Brand-new, surround sound,
HDTV compatible.

378
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:34,430
- Tell them thanks, but...
- This is getting heavy.

379
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:38,100
If this is about Rhode Island,
tell them I already signed.

380
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:42,229
I don't know what it's about.
But the TV stays here. Put it down.

381
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:45,316
No! I mean it!

382
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,902
Pick it up! Get it off my property!

383
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:51,071
Look, pal, I don't think you
quite understand.

384
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,240
I understand, only too well.

385
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,659
Tell your friends I know
all about them.

386
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:58,204
If you did, you'd do what they want.

387
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,706
Is that a threat?

388
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,417
How things change.
Let me tell you, Guido...

389
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:04,627
I'm Clarence.

390
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:08,631
I have friends in law enforcement,
and they'd call this extortion.

391
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,050
Come on.

392
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:18,849
You tell those assholes
Don Hauser will not be intimidated!

393
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:21,894
I will not be threatened or bribed!

394
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:24,980
I go where I want to
when I want to!

395
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:29,443
Hey!

396
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,866
All day, every day,
85 and not one drop of rain.

397
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:37,660
And those nights.

398
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:41,622
Bobbi, you are so lucky
with this guy. You have no idea.

399
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,999
He's a sweetheart underneath it all.

400
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:46,877
I wish I could get Lou to
be like him.

401
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:49,421
More sensitive,
if you know what I mean.

402
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,048
That coral looks good.

403
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:55,844
I don't understand why I always
have to ask him for oral sex.

404
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:59,223
Not like you and your Corrado.

405
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:03,769
Bebe, listen, I know we always used to
yak about our sex lives.

406
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:06,981
I think it would be better
if we didn't anymore.

407
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:09,441
- Okay.
- I mean it.

408
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:10,818
Sure!

409
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:13,279
Just, you're lucky, that's all.

410
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:21,662
So, Ma, you coming to the game?

411
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:23,622
Game? What game?

412
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,375
Meadow's team is going to
the sectionals.

413
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,168
Nobody tells me anything.

414
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,838
Did everybody hear me just tell her?

415
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:34,466
Can anybody think of anything
else to talk about?

416
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:38,345
All right. Uncle Jun, how was Boca?

417
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:41,265
Wonderful. I don't go down enough.

418
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:43,517
That's not what I heard.

419
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:46,020
About what?

420
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:51,400
I don't know what I'm talking about.

421
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:53,819
Last time, Aunt Bobbi
bought me a piranha.

422
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,529
A piranha? Come on!

423
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:58,198
That woman is not your aunt.

424
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:01,535
Livia, I warned you.
Bobbi is a sweet, sweet girl.

425
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:05,789
What's the matter?

426
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,207
What did I say?

427
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:10,961
This wife of yours,
she's got the giggles.

428
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:14,214
- Can I be excused?
- We just sat down!

429
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:17,551
- How can you play if you don't eat?
- You need protein.

430
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:20,763
- No, I don't, because I quit.
- You quit?

431
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,641
With Ally back,
you can go to the states.

432
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,393
She slits her wrists,
and you think of a game?

433
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:30,189
It wasn't like Cobain.
It was just a little suicidal gesture.

434
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:34,026
- Come back here!
- You're not excused!

435
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:36,612
Let her go. Go ahead, honey!

436
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,489
- Ma!
- Why don't you butt out?

437
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:41,617
You only act nice when
you want to score points.

438
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,997
I will not eat in this house.

439
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:49,083
Junior, take me home.

440
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:52,419
- I'm not finished.
- She'll come back.

441
00:27:56,841 --> 00:28:01,136
Stukas and Messerschmitts,
they have command of the skies.

442
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:09,937
I don't know.

443
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:12,231
I'm glad Meadow quit.

444
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,984
That coach pushes them to
the brink. It's unhealthy.

445
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,654
What do we mean when we
say commitment?

446
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,281
He thinks he can just walk away.

447
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:23,242
Watch it, cowboy, don't start.

448
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:29,373
- What's with you and Uncle Jun?
- Don't bother that coach.

449
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:33,043
- Come on. Tell me about Uncle Jun.
- No, stop it!

450
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,628
I can't!

451
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,256
- Yes, you can.
- All right. Okay.

452
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:45,013
Gabby Dante's cousin and Bobbi
go to the same nail parlor.

453
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:50,436
And your uncle...
No, I shouldn't say. I shouldn't!

454
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:53,188
- Come on.
- Okay, okay, okay.

455
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:59,403
Well, let's just say...

456
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:03,991
...your uncle has acquired
a taste for her.

457
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,160
Uncle Jun gives head?

458
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:07,828
World-class.

459
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:11,707
- He whistles to the wheat field?
- Don't be disgusting.

460
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,377
- He's a bushman of the Kalahari!
- That's why I don't tell you.

461
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:17,421
You don't know when to stop!

462
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:19,631
My God, if this ever gets out...

463
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:22,843
Yeah, like you don't do it.
Or any of your friends.

464
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:25,012
Bunch of hypocrites.

465
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:29,183
What goes on in this bedroom
stays here, and you know that.

466
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:33,854
Once a year?
I can resist the urge to gossip.

467
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:48,076
Arthur? You're home?

468
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:50,496
The grease in that Frialator.

469
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:53,540
I'm gonna smell like
a cheap French fry forever.

470
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:57,878
So this is why we scrimp and save
to send our kids to that school?

471
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,631
So our name is dragged
through the mud?

472
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,216
What?

473
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,885
Shelly Hauser called me
this afternoon.

474
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:09,056
Your friend sent some Y.O.'s
down there with a stolen TV set...

475
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:11,099
...to try and bribe the coach.

476
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:13,644
From your friends at Bada Bing!

477
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:18,899
As if a TV set is gonna get somewhere
with a man like Coach Hauser.

478
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:20,651
A TV set?

479
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:25,239
Do you honestly believe
that they're gonna stop there?

480
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:28,075
They tried bribing this man.

481
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:29,701
What's next?

482
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:34,498
- Always with the extreme scenarios.
- No, come on. Tell me, what's next?

483
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:36,124
You grew up here.

484
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:40,587
Don't pretend like you don't know
what Tony Soprano is capable of.

485
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,258
Who is it?

486
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:45,676
I found your dog.

487
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,685
What?

488
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:57,104
No, you're mistaken.
My dog is upstairs.

489
00:30:57,272 --> 00:31:00,107
Golden Retriever, blue nylon collar?

490
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:01,775
Honey, who is it?

491
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,026
Evening, ma'am.

492
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,906
He has our dog.

493
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,491
Where is Petey?

494
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,493
- He was locked in.
- Come get him.

495
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,996
I wouldn't want Petey
to get hit by a car.

496
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:33,807
Petey, Petey!

497
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,434
You okay? Come here.

498
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:37,477
What, no reward?

499
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,440
Just kidding. I'm an animal lover.

500
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:44,818
You okay, boy?

501
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,821
Med, cheer up about the coach...

502
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:50,824
...because I feel he'll
reconsider the big move.

503
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,451
Tony.

504
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,119
Did you do something?

505
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:55,829
What could I do?

506
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:59,750
He's gonna stick around and finish
what he started with the girls.

507
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,836
That's it.

508
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,672
Well, did I tell you?

509
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:15,098
Develop some appreciation,
because everyone helps you...

510
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,643
...and all you do is bitch and moan!

511
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:22,022
This coach abandons his team,
and your friends get all worked up.

512
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:23,690
So I try to do something.

513
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:25,817
Is that why you think we're upset?

514
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:29,696
Because a coach who most of us
can't even stand is leaving?

515
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:33,408
You don't have to love him
to be successful.

516
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:35,369
"Catfish" Hunter hated Billy Martin.

517
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:38,914
Bill Parcells' guys can't stand him,
till they start to win.

518
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,500
Coach Hauser had sex with Ally.

519
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,044
What?

520
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:48,715
That's why she cut herself. That's
why I've been living at her house.

521
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,469
All right, hold on a minute.

522
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,929
Maybe...

523
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:58,266
With Ally?

524
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,477
Meadow, this is horrible.

525
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:04,731
This is also a serious accusation.
What exactly did Ally say?

526
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,985
That they had sex, more than once...

527
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:10,362
...that she's not a virgin anymore!

528
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:14,408
All right.

529
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,995
Ally's a very pretty girl.

530
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,663
Maybe there was...

531
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:22,582
Maybe there was confusion.
Maybe she wanted to...

532
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,419
...look like she was sophisticated.
- Dad!

533
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,425
- What?
- Tony, what if this had been Meadow?

534
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,593
What kind of confusion?

535
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:36,805
At her age? The coach shouldn't
have been in any position...

536
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:40,517
...where there's even a remote
possibility of confusion!

537
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:43,645
I'm losing my mind here.

538
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,981
Go downstairs
so me and Meadow can talk.

539
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:48,275
Jesus fucking Christ!

540
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,029
God, now what did I do?

541
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:56,199
I only told so he wouldn't make
Coach Hauser stay.

542
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:59,745
Meadow, this is a horrible,
horrible thing.

543
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:03,165
She's in love with him.
But he won't leave his wife.

544
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,959
Leave his wife? Meadow!

545
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,881
- Now, he didn't touch you, right?
- No.

546
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:12,841
What about Deena?

547
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:15,677
If she hears about her father,
it'll destroy her.

548
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,847
Tell Dad to let him go
anywhere he wants, okay?

549
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,766
Come here.

550
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,901
Moldonado and his brother,
they'll handle it.

551
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:33,820
Mol owes me a solid.

552
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:38,408
No. No hired help.
This is personal.

553
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:40,994
I'm glad to hear you say that.

554
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:43,830
I'm gonna give him
a real after-school special.

555
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:49,711
- You out of your mind?
- What?

556
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:54,424
You kidnapped the coach's dog.
But if you do one more thing...

557
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:58,220
Shut up, Arthur. You're five
time zones behind your own ass.

558
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:01,723
No, I'm fucking serious.
You hear me, Tony?

559
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,184
You're serious?

560
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:05,727
Want to hear serious?

561
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:08,021
Want to know what your coach did?

562
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:12,776
He fucked little Ally Vandermeed
and who knows who else he fucked.

563
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:15,403
What are you talking about?
Fucked?

564
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:19,741
That's crazy.

565
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:22,577
That's why that kid slit her wrist.

566
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,412
And my daughter should know?

567
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:27,582
She should have to think
about that filth?

568
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:30,210
- No.
- No?

569
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:32,587
That self-righteous prick
put his dick...

570
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:35,757
...in my little girl's soccer teammate.

571
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:39,052
Yeah. She's in 11th grade,
for chrissake!

572
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:40,262
Oh, my God.

573
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:45,225
Chiara. He drove her home
one night when it was raining.

574
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,893
Oh, my little girl.

575
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:50,063
- Degenerate son of a bitch.
- He deserves to die!

576
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:52,607
Betraying children?

577
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:55,902
Believe me, he ain't gonna be doing
that shit no more.

578
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:58,280
I guarantee you that.

579
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,927
Nobody said to put my nephew
under surveillance.

580
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,805
I know, Junior. I know.

581
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:27,058
I wanted to be safe
and I'm glad I was.

582
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:30,353
Because your nephew isn't just
at that titty bar...

583
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,397
...and going to soccer games.

584
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:33,857
Go ahead.

585
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:37,819
Twice last week he goes toward
the medical center...

586
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,279
...and they lose him.

587
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:40,906
A girlfriend.

588
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,449
No, no, no.

589
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:45,285
He's seeing this
Russian slit very open.

590
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:47,621
Your nephew is talking to the feds.

591
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:51,583
Where else would he be going
that requires such precautions?

592
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:54,461
What the fuck else
would be the big secret?

593
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,588
What am I, a swami?

594
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,591
Hey!

595
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:01,718
- Silvio!
- Mikey!

596
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:04,804
How you doing?
You're looking good.

597
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:06,514
How you feel?

598
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,354
You shanked it, Sil.

599
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:15,023
I still got the coach on my mind.

600
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:20,320
We got fresh air, we got sunshine.
Forget about that shit.

601
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:22,155
Thank God for golf some days.

602
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,407
I'm trying to concentrate here.

603
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:28,370
Did you get any golf in at Boca?

604
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,830
Fucking manners, please!

605
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:38,004
You play Manatee,
or what's that other one?

606
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:42,801
Will you let the man tee off?
You yap worse than six barbers!

607
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:45,845
If you'd have shut up during
that Mountain Lakes game...

608
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:48,181
...you wouldn't have missed
that fly ball.

609
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,392
I was ashamed to face my friends.

610
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:55,063
Good, Mikey. Better.

611
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:56,773
What do you mean, better?

612
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:59,693
Well, you know, it's better.

613
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:07,534
Whoa, Junior!

614
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,703
Whoa, Junior, what?

615
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:13,832
- Uncle Jun's into muff.
- What?

616
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:18,128
Oh, did I say muff?
I meant ruff.

617
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:23,258
Good shot.

618
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,556
What's that smell?
Did you guys go to a sushi bar?

619
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:32,267
- What's he talking about?
- I don't know.

620
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,062
I thought you were a baccala man.
What are you doing eating sushi?

621
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:38,940
You're fucking running off
at the mouth.

622
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:48,575
Listen, my friend.

623
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:53,204
At least I can deal with
my own problems. Unlike some I know.

624
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,456
What's that mean?

625
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:57,167
Take it however you want.
Don't bullshit me.

626
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,753
Guys, we here to play golf or what?

627
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:01,421
Come on.

628
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:10,764
Arthur...

629
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,268
...everybody's just so upset.

630
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:19,522
The mother's on sedatives.
She's completely unable to deal.

631
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:22,025
The father lives in Europe somewhere.

632
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:25,570
The little girl, Ally, she thinks
it's all her fault.

633
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,615
Bastard. He won't
get away with this!

634
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,992
You got that right.

635
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:32,660
What?

636
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:37,082
Hand me that bottle
of Bug-B-Gon, will you?

637
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:38,666
Arthur, what?

638
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,047
Something going on, Artie?

639
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:48,343
Your mobster friend
gonna do something?

640
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:54,265
If I had any balls,
I would do it myself.

641
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:57,852
You do have balls.
That's why you're not like him.

642
00:39:58,104 --> 00:39:59,145
Fuck it.

643
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:00,897
Fuck the world!

644
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,150
This isn't making a slob
take his hat off.

645
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:08,530
This is beating a man to death
or cutting his balls off, or what?

646
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:12,325
You can't tell me
he doesn't deserve it!

647
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:14,744
Okay, but...

648
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:17,664
Listen, think about
what you're saying!

649
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:19,582
Yeah, you tell me.

650
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:23,378
Who's worse: Tony Soprano
or that child-molesting fuck?

651
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:27,715
I trusted him. I'd like to
rip his heart out of his chest!

652
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:31,511
Jesus Christ, I cannot believe
you only think about yourself!

653
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:32,887
Myself?

654
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:35,598
Myself?

655
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,351
I resent that, Charmaine.

656
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:53,366
Junior, what the fuck?
What's the matter?

657
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:57,412
What? That bullshit with the sushi?

658
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:03,710
No. I don't know what he
was talking about. He babbles.

659
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:05,879
- What?
- You're another one!

660
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:08,673
Me? He completely lacked respect.

661
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:11,885
I'm tired of having to make
excuses for him.

662
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:14,888
- It isn't right.
- Because he's a mental weakling.

663
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:17,098
- I know.
- You don't know shit!

664
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:24,522
He's seeing a psychiatrist.

665
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:26,024
How about that?

666
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:30,403
My nephew is seeing a psychiatrist.
It makes me want to cry.

667
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:31,571
No shit?

668
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:35,241
The indictment's being prepared.
He's spilling his guts!

669
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,118
I fucking knew it.

670
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:39,954
No, you didn't know it.
I just told you.

671
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:46,586
God knows how much
of our family business he has.

672
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:49,756
- If the place is bugged?
- That's not admissible.

673
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:54,594
It's that doctor-patient privilege.
Just like us and Melvoin.

674
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:57,764
Melvoin's a lawyer.
He's in the fucking ballpark.

675
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:00,808
Suppose this shrink gets
scared or something?

676
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:03,686
Remember those two brothers
in California?

677
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,772
They whacked their parents?

678
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:07,899
The shrink was in a witness chair.

679
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:10,860
Shit.

680
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,533
Anthony wants to play games, okay.

681
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:18,493
I taught him games.

682
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:22,705
I taught him how to play baseball.

683
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:28,336
Talking about clipping him?

684
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,547
Nobody would slap my wrist if I did.

685
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:35,385
Guys in prison have done
half the damage he has.

686
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:39,389
The judicial system has improved
in dealing with sexual predators.

687
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:41,391
Oh, yeah. Let's impeach him.

688
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,018
If you're telling me of intent
to harm him...

689
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:47,438
...I must warn you of my duty to
alert law enforcement.

690
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,023
Why do I tell you anything?

691
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:53,820
I'm interested in why you feel
punishing this man falls upon you.

692
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:56,114
- It doesn't fall upon you.
- What?

693
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:58,408
What would you do?
You'd call the cops...

694
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:01,244
...who'd get some judge,
who'd give him counseling...

695
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:05,957
...to talk about his unhappy childhood,
and we could have sympathy for him.

696
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:08,167
Because he's the victim, right?

697
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:11,045
You know what you do?
You ignore the truth.

698
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,464
Discredit psychology all you want.

699
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:18,136
But I continue to ask the question.
Why do you think you...

700
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:21,639
...always have to set things right?

701
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,191
Hey, Paulie, is Tony in?

702
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:33,735
- Tony?
- Artie.

703
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:35,278
I got to talk to you.

704
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:36,613
I'm busy right now.

705
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:38,406
I got to talk to you.

706
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:43,202
All right. We'll finish
later, all right?

707
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:56,799
Come on in.

708
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:08,436
It's about the thing.

709
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:09,812
You know what?

710
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:15,318
- Nothing's happened yet, has it?
- Just got to make the call.

711
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:18,738
- I'm savoring the moment.
- Call it off.

712
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,115
Don't worry about it.

713
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:22,617
You don't go near this.

714
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:25,578
I don't care about that.
It's wrong, Tony.

715
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:29,415
- You can't do it.
- It's wrong?

716
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:30,750
What he did isn't?

717
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:33,252
I'm begging you.
I hate the guy too.

718
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:36,214
What do you want to do?

719
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,967
Want to call the cops?
Here's the phone.

720
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:42,470
They'll arrest him.

721
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:45,598
And he'll get out in two
years and move north.

722
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:46,933
And then?

723
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:49,644
He'll teach girls' soccer
and start all over.

724
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:53,606
You don't think I want to rip him
apart like a chicken?

725
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:57,568
I drove by his house.
I almost got out.

726
00:44:58,779 --> 00:44:59,779
But you didn't.

727
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:02,782
Something happens to him,
who does it help?

728
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:05,785
His daughter? That girl?

729
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:07,412
No. You, Tony.

730
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:12,750
And Silvio and me and whoever.
It's just gonna make us feel better.

731
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:17,630
So don't even think about calling this
justice. Leave it to the cops.

732
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:19,966
Look, let me ask you a question.

733
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:23,636
Who are you, coming in here
talking to me like this?!

734
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:27,765
Now, your boyfriend is finished.
You deal with it!

735
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:28,975
Okay?

736
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:31,477
Tony, don't do it.

737
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:33,146
This is me asking you.

738
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:34,939
Why don't you get out?!

739
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:36,524
Come on.

740
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:38,651
Get the fuck out, go!

741
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,278
Let's go!

742
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:42,155
Come on, come on!

743
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:03,903
Corrado?

744
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:07,740
I was worried! You usually call
me when you're this late.

745
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:13,329
I bought us some barbecued chicken,
salad and lemon meringue pie.

746
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,248
But I got hungry and ate.

747
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:17,583
Did I tell you to
keep your mouth shut?!

748
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:21,128
Did I tell you to keep
your goddamn mouth shut?!

749
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,797
Don't hit me!

750
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:42,608
You stupid fucking blabbermouth cunt!

751
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:46,112
I don't understand!

752
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:50,825
Get your pencils and your crap
and don't be here tomorrow!

753
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:53,870
No, Corrado. Don't leave.

754
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:56,205
I love you!

755
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:00,209
I am so sorry!

756
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:02,587
No, Corrado!

757
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:25,902
- Yeah?
- You there at the place?

758
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:27,361
Is he in the house?

759
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:30,489
Fuck it. Walk away.

760
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:32,366
Just walk away.
Don't do it.

761
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:34,577
Fuck!

762
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:35,828
All right.

763
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:38,831
- Leave it alone.
- Yeah. No problem.

764
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:41,918
Son of a bitch!

765
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:45,254
Colleagues and neighbors were
shocked...

766
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:48,257
...to hear of
charges brought against Hauser...

767
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:51,844
...coach of the Verbum Dei
high school girls' soccer team.

768
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:54,680
Alerted by a friend of
the alleged victim...

769
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:57,350
...whose name cannot be revealed...

770
00:48:57,684 --> 00:49:00,186
...police issued a warrant
for his arrest.

771
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:12,907
- Tony.
- Carmela.

772
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:19,580
Tony, Jesus! You smell
like Lord Calvert.

773
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:26,337
Tony.

774
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:44,563
What is with you tonight?

775
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:49,568
Tony, what is this?

776
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:52,571
Jesus!

777
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:54,156
Mixed with alcohol!

778
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:57,243
Tony, that's wonderful.
Happy trails.

779
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:59,078
Here, let's get you to bed.

780
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:00,913
Carmela.

781
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:02,581
Carmela.

782
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:06,752
I didn't hurt nobody.

783
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:25,396
Call the shrink. Tell her the
town's gonna give her a fucking bonus.
