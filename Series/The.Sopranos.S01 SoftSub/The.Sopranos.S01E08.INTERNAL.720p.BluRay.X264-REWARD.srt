1
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:54,196
In the Czech Republic too,
we love pork.

2
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:57,074
Ever had our sausages?

3
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:05,791
In the Czech Republic too,
we love pork.

4
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,710
You ever had our sausages?

5
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:31,233
Adriana?

6
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:35,195
In the Czech Republic too,
we love pork. Ever had our sausages?

7
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,451
Emil Kolar?

8
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:46,915
- Help you?
- Salami sub, hold the mayo.

9
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,959
We're out of mayo.

10
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:55,007
Change my meat to black forest.

11
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,435
You killed me.

12
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,187
What do you want me to do?

13
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,521
I want to tell you.

14
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,690
What?
You come here every night.

15
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,442
You fucked up.

16
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,569
What do you mean?

17
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,155
Here's these.

18
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,199
Where'd you find them?

19
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,452
One in the table. Three in my skull.

20
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:28,582
You will have our sausages.

21
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,375
Get rid of these.

22
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,962
Let go of me! Let go!

23
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:48,268
- I would've wrapped it...
- That's okay. A computer!

24
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,772
This one got such a good write-up,
I got one for myself.

25
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:55,067
- Let's move on, okay?
- Congratulations. God bless.

26
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:03,325
You look gorgeous.
Who's your date?

27
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,410
What do you mean, "Who's your date?"

28
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,704
- Good to see you.
- Congratulations.

29
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,999
- Thank you.
- Melissa was beautiful up there.

30
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,710
Oh, Mama Livia, come stai, darling?

31
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,630
Listen to him,
with that "my darling."

32
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,216
I am nobody's darling.

33
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,426
She never disappoints you.

34
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,346
Are you still seeing your
other women, Lorenzo?

35
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,224
Come on, Ma, let's mingle.

36
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:30,185
Sorry, the older she gets,
the worse she gets.

37
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,189
I heard disturbing shit last night.
I wanted to talk to you.

38
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,026
But with the rehearsal dinner
and everything, you know...

39
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,570
There's the priest.
I'll be right back.

40
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,162
Yeah!

41
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:57,754
Federal indictments?
Where the fuck did you get this?

42
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:03,051
I got a guy, his goomar works at FBI
headquarters as a word processor.

43
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:04,720
When's it coming down?

44
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,723
I don't know. When she knows,
she'll tell me.

45
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,350
- Indictments? What the fuck?
- You sure?

46
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:15,022
It ain't just my source in Jersey. Half
of New York moved to Fort Lauderdale.

47
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,691
Fuck! They're gonna want my ass.

48
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,276
Why?

49
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,611
What do you mean, why? I'm O.C.

50
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,697
When'd you get your wings?

51
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:27,826
I didn't. Not yet, anyway.

52
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:31,163
Uncle Junior, you got anything to say?

53
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:34,541
You guys see indictments
under your bed at night.

54
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:38,712
You're ready to lam it. As far as
I'm concerned, it's speculation.

55
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:40,088
It's rumor.

56
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,717
Better be safe than sorry.
I say we duck for a while.

57
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:47,054
What're we gonna do,
close shop? We can't do that.

58
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,056
Tony, what do you think?

59
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:54,436
What the fuck are you asking him for?
I just gave you the answer.

60
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:58,732
He's right, we go, it's open season.
Albanians will be living in our houses.

61
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:01,943
I just gave a G-note
to Larry Boy's kid for the boost.

62
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:05,280
If I have to lam in a hurry,
I'd have duped her another time.

63
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:17,793
I gotta go. It's an emergency.
Say goodbye to your father for me.

64
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,466
I agree with my uncle.
He calls the shots, we do it.

65
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:27,469
Well, maybe for today,
for right now...

66
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:31,598
...you were thinking that everybody
should do spring cleaning?

67
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,600
That was my next comment.

68
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,346
Think they'll come over the weekend?

69
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,682
They're coming someday.

70
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,189
- Where's the rest of the money?
- Everywhere.

71
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:22,816
Get it.

72
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,864
- What else?
- How about your phone numbers?

73
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,783
Anybody who's anybody's in my head.

74
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:41,835
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. Just, here we go.

75
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,503
Here.

76
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:49,217
Why now? Why the fuck now,
just when things were going good?

77
00:07:57,768 --> 00:08:00,979
- Boot your computer, cops are coming.
- So?

78
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,940
You want them to see
that porno you downloaded?

79
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,494
Better give me your jewelry.

80
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,288
Oh, Jesus!

81
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:22,083
We can't produce receipts.
You want them stealing it?

82
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:27,964
Come on.

83
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:31,134
Not my engagement ring.
This isn't stolen.

84
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:33,970
Is it?

85
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:35,722
No.

86
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,766
What do you think I am?

87
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,728
Come on, give me that!

88
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,173
Adriana!

89
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:14,761
It ate my whole script now!

90
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:21,268
You're still on the file.
You deleted the text.

91
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,979
The fuck... Whatever.
You fucking asshole!

92
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:27,148
Stop with the hysteria,
would you please?

93
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:31,903
If you're gonna keep behaving
like a baby, I'm not gonna help you.

94
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,196
I mean it.

95
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:36,533
At least you work that
squirrel program in the restaurant.

96
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,871
There, the text came back.

97
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:45,500
- You put it in buffer memory.
- What do you think?

98
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,377
Of the script?

99
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:51,548
Babe, I can't give an opinion
every time you add a sentence.

100
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,217
I gotta have the whole story flow.

101
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,386
I'm starting with the dialogue.

102
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:09,524
"I manuged to get the drop on him"?

103
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:12,611
Do you mean, "I managed
to get the drop on him"?

104
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:16,823
Or is he saying "manuge,"
like mannuggia l'americano?

105
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,043
My Tennessee William.

106
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:33,923
Where you going?

107
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,052
Get over here.

108
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:41,598
I have never seen you
apply yourself like this.

109
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:44,809
I love movies. You know that.

110
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,228
That smell in Blockbuster...

111
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,066
...that candy and carpet smell,
I get high off it.

112
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,402
Gonna let all this love
and knowledge go to waste?

113
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:58,823
My cousin Gregory's girlfriend, Amy,
who works for Tarantino, said:

114
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:03,370
"Mob stories are always hot."
I can make my mark.

115
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:10,001
With these indictments, shouldn't
you put the script away for a while...

116
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,295
...and get rid of evidence?

117
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:16,424
Travel light. Free bird.

118
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:20,595
You stole this computer, plus
the one you just gave Melissa.

119
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,184
I'm writing.

120
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:27,644
Turn on channel 6.

121
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,771
Turn on channel 6.

122
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:36,611
New Jersey Attorney General,
James Ricci, stated at a fundraiser...

123
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,948
...that a grand jury has been
empaneled to investigate...

124
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:44,452
...possible Mob activities in the
Garden State with indictments to follow.

125
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:48,206
With us is syndicated columnist
and author of Mafia:

126
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:51,334
America's Longest-Running
Soap Opera, Jeffrey Wernick.

127
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,795
- Welcome.
- Pleasure to be here.

128
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:58,007
For years, FBI has been telling us
that the Mafia is all but dead.

129
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,467
Let me interject.

130
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:04,639
While it is true that the Mob is
getting a standing eight-count...

131
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:08,518
...I wouldn't call the fight.
The government knows this best.

132
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:13,398
Murder, truck hijacking and money
laundering are expected inquiries.

133
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,984
Do we know names of those
who'll be indicted?

134
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:19,154
The indictments are sealed,
but with the recent death...

135
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:21,990
...of acting Di Meo family boss,
Jackie Aprile...

136
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:25,952
...my sources tell me that
Corrado "Junior" Soprano...

137
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:29,456
...was made new boss
after the death of Aprile.

138
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:33,752
The Sopranos have long, historic
ties to the New York families.

139
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,337
What about possible
murder charges?

140
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:40,133
They will undoubtedly be
focused on the as yet unsolved...

141
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:44,637
...execution-style slaying of Soprano
family associate, Brendan Filone.

142
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,850
- Was it part of a power struggle?
- Interesting.

143
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:51,728
No one would have ranked him
as associate!

144
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,439
- a loyal soldier,
and he winds up dead...

145
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,274
Soldier?

146
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:59,694
Brendan Filone? Associate?
Soldier? Fuck you!

147
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,321
Jesus!

148
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:14,000
Did you see it from the beginning?
Did they mention my name?

149
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:19,214
Stop the fucking chitchat, all right?
I gotta go.

150
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,805
Nobody makes guinso gravy
like you, Nana.

151
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:30,517
You know, I'm up at Bard
waiting for my care package.

152
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,393
I don't like that word, Jason.

153
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,728
What, guinso?

154
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:37,023
- The word is offensive!
- She's right, Jason.

155
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,651
Sorry, Nana. What's it mean?

156
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,903
- It's from guinea.
- What's that?

157
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,030
It's a derogation.

158
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:47,909
I have a patient.
You wouldn't say guinea to him.

159
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:52,372
Italian male seeing a shrink.
Let me guess: mother issues.

160
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,582
- Why wouldn't you?
- Just wouldn't.

161
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,085
You'd be scared?
Is he in the Mafia?

162
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:01,256
No, I shouldn't have mentioned
it! Can we change the subject?

163
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,509
No way. Mom, is he
in the Mob, or what?

164
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,594
He's not a mobster, is he?

165
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:10,765
Nobody knows better than you, Richard.
I can't discuss my patients.

166
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,727
I just hope he's not one of those
crumbs on the news.

167
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:19,524
Just refer him to another doctor.
You can do that, couldn't you?

168
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,484
Grate the cheese, Dad.

169
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,486
Sure she can.

170
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,240
That might be what
you would do, Richard.

171
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:29,784
Now I remember why we got divorced.

172
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:33,329
Why refer him to another doctor?
He's my patient.

173
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:37,333
You can't treat sociopaths. You
shouldn't help scum with bed-wetting.

174
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:41,045
You have no idea who this man is,
and yet you call him scum.

175
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:44,799
People like him are the reason
Italian-Americans have a bad image.

176
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,050
I agree.

177
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:50,138
Ask anyone to describe an
Italian-American in this country...

178
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:54,767
...invariably he's gonna reference
The Godfather, GoodFellas...

179
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,185
Good movies.

180
00:14:56,437 --> 00:15:00,356
...and the rest will mention pizza.
- Good movies to eat pizza by.

181
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,902
Stop it, Jason!
I never said he was in the Mafia.

182
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,195
We'll never see an Italian president.

183
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,406
And that's my patient's fault?

184
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:12,535
I realize that you're involved
in the Anti-Defamation lobby.

185
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:17,624
So go after Hollywood if you feel
you must. But leave my patient alone.

186
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:18,833
It's a synergy.

187
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:22,879
News items and the portrayal
of Italian-Americans as gangsters!

188
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:28,217
Wasn't the Italian Anti-Def deal
started by Joe Colombo? A mobster?

189
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:31,095
Italians Against Discrimination
did a study.

190
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:34,641
In its height, the Mafia in the U.S.
had less than 5000 members.

191
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,810
And yet, that tiny,
insignificant fraction...

192
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:42,190
...casts such a dark shadow over
20 million hard-working Americans.

193
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,986
At this point in our cultural history,
Mob movies are classic American cinema.

194
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,196
Like Westerns.

195
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,323
I have to agree there, Rich.

196
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:53,576
You never saw the Scotch-Irish
pissing and moaning...

197
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:57,121
...about being portrayed
as rustlers and gunslingers.

198
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,456
That's absurd!

199
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:01,125
See what you started
with your gravy, Nana?

200
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:04,754
To we, the 20 million.

201
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:06,881
- Salute!
- Salute!

202
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:10,051
- Cent'anni.
- Salute.

203
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:28,778
What?

204
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,571
Come here.
We're exterminating.

205
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:31,781
I'm busy now.

206
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:34,033
Get some sfogliatelle for the guys.

207
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,827
Yeah.

208
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:52,593
Twenty-nine.

209
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:02,061
Here you go, big guy.

210
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,197
Hey, Gino. What can I get you?

211
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,492
- Get me some...
- Number 34, right here!

212
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:19,370
He just went out
to get gas in his car.

213
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:23,791
I go out, fuck your sister, come
back Saturday, I go to the front?

214
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,126
I said he could.

215
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,336
Poppin' Fresh, I'm in no mood!

216
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:30,298
I'm next, now get
a fucking pastry box.

217
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,342
Gino, what can I get you?

218
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,178
Dougie, let him go first.

219
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,305
He don't make the rules here!

220
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,392
All right, two Neapolitan loaves...

221
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:45,688
You touch a single crust, you'll
wish you took that job at McDonalds!

222
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:46,939
Fuck you!

223
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,192
Okay, take a walk.

224
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:53,362
- What about my bread?
- You come back in 10 minutes.

225
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,448
What do you think you're doing?

226
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,116
Come on.

227
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,668
Get up, I'm not gonna hurt you.

228
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:12,173
What is it?
Do I look like a pussy to you?

229
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:15,510
- No.
- Seriously, be honest, I won't get mad.

230
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,053
- No.
- No?

231
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:20,515
So why give me a hard time
and talk to me like I'm nothing?

232
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:22,683
I'm sorry.

233
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,977
Get a pastry box.

234
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,313
Move it!

235
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,400
That's better.

236
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:35,780
Now fill it with cannoli,
sfogliatelle and napoleons.

237
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,328
Move.

238
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,582
Good.

239
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:52,421
Give me the box. Come on.

240
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,382
Here.

241
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:03,891
Next time you see my face,
show some respect.

242
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,643
I will.

243
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,148
You motherfucker!

244
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,774
You shot my foot!

245
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:15,653
- It happens.
- You fucking asshole!

246
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:25,580
If I'm getting an invitation to the
dance, I wish the feds would hurry up.

247
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:27,582
You heard what the news said.

248
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,501
The way things are working,
it's Junior's party.

249
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:33,588
That was a far-thinking plan
you had there, Tone.

250
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,675
I called you last Christmas.

251
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:38,926
Fuck this!

252
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,929
The sfogliatelle!
What's wrong with you?

253
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,683
What are you doing?
You brought up in a barn, or what?

254
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,476
What's the matter with you?

255
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:52,148
This is no time to go on the rag.
Not with the indictment coming down.

256
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,943
Take Georgie, go in the bathroom,
sweep for bugs.

257
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:57,987
Come on.

258
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,122
Well, I hope they'll be all right.

259
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:09,957
Who?

260
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,835
- The guys.
- What about me?

261
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,963
They didn't even
mention your name on TV.

262
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:20,551
Amazing, huh? That news guy,
he said the words "Brendan Filone"...

263
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:24,513
...the hairs on the back of my neck,
they fucking stood up.

264
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:25,932
I knew the guy.

265
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,518
They made him look like
John-fucking-Gotti.

266
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:31,479
I brought him around here.

267
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:36,567
Tony wouldn't have never known him
if it wasn't for me.

268
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,069
I had no idea.

269
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,757
Who is it? I'm sleeping.

270
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:03,010
- Carmela.
- Oh, come on in.

271
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:06,806
I just said that in case
you were...

272
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:10,393
...that snooty-assed Mrs. Ryan
down the hall.

273
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:15,314
She is so shanty Irish,
and with all her airs.

274
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:18,401
- Come on, I'm taking you to brunch.
- What?

275
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,819
Get dressed.

276
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,612
What's wrong? Tell me.

277
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,323
Why does something have to be wrong?

278
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,367
Meadow? She eats like a bird.

279
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,829
Everything is fine, Ma, relax!
Nothing is wrong.

280
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:34,834
You come here unannounced. I shouldn't
wonder if something's wrong?

281
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:40,214
Jeez, I'm sorry. It's a nice day,
I thought I would take you out.

282
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:44,677
I don't want to go out!

283
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,849
Is it Anthony? Those indictments?

284
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,643
His father could take it in stride,
but he can't.

285
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,478
I don't believe you.

286
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,942
Ma, will you get dressed?

287
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:03,195
- We just went to a wedding!
- That was a big to-do.

288
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:06,407
This way we get to spend
some quality time.

289
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,245
The Manor will stop serving
brunch any minute.

290
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,209
Did he cheat on you again?

291
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:22,798
I try to do something nice.
I come here to take you out.

292
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:27,762
You think I have some other agenda
that I have to talk to you about?

293
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,805
Don't flatter yourself.

294
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:34,185
I'll...
I'll throw something on.

295
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,815
Buckle your seat belt, Ma.

296
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:43,444
I can't find it! Where is it?

297
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:11,365
It's not definite.
I just thought I'd tell you.

298
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:14,201
In case I don't show up
for an appointment.

299
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:19,373
You're telling me you're planning
a vacation, but you're not sure when?

300
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:20,875
Right.

301
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:24,837
I may never go.

302
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,632
Let's put it this way:

303
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:33,095
There's a strong possibility
that it could happen.

304
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:39,727
Does this have anything to do
with what's been on the news lately?

305
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:47,193
If you suddenly stop coming
to your appointments...

306
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:50,070
...I will assume that you are
on vacation?

307
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:53,407
And I should wait to be contacted?

308
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,910
That would be a good assumption.

309
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:06,504
- Who is it?
- Paulie. Open the door.

310
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:27,149
I thought we were stepping out.

311
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:31,028
I got two broads in the car.

312
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,822
You said Ad went to stay
at her mother's.

313
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:41,205
No wonder. The place looks
like a fucking sty.

314
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,042
What's wrong?

315
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,630
Talk to me. This ain't like you, kid.

316
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:54,635
I ran into Billy Cracciolo.

317
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:56,762
The meter maid?
What about him?

318
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:59,932
Told me the cops in Nutley
are looking for a guy.

319
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:04,311
Blew off a kid's toe for
no good reason in Russo's Bakery.

320
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:05,813
Drove a Lexus?

321
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:11,318
Does Tony know about this?

322
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:14,780
What's going on, Chrissy?

323
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:19,827
Been working my ass off on this script.
You know how many pages I got?

324
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,078
Nineteen.

325
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:24,206
That a lot or a little?

326
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:28,210
Books say a movie's supposed to be
about 120 pages.

327
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:30,796
I thought the computer would
do a lot of it.

328
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,173
You're being frank
about the business...

329
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:36,844
I would never do that.
It's only "suggested by."

330
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:42,182
That writer, with the bullfights?
Blew his own fucking head off.

331
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:44,893
I bought a scriptwriting program.

332
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:48,397
My advice?
Put that thing down awhile.

333
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,107
We get our joints copped.

334
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:53,402
Tomorrow, the words will come
blowing out your ass.

335
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:58,198
You ever feel like nothing
good would ever happen?

336
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,951
Yeah. And nothing did. So what?

337
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:02,870
I'm alive, I'm surviving.

338
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:06,206
That's it.
I don't want to just survive.

339
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:11,211
It says in movie-writing books that
every character has an arc, understand?

340
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:17,343
Everybody starts out somewheres
and then they do something...

341
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:20,179
...it changes their life.
That's their arc.

342
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:22,139
Where's my arc?

343
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:27,227
All right, take Richard Kimble, right?

344
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:33,067
No, that's no good. His arc is
run, run, jump off the dam...

345
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:38,280
Keanu Reeves, Devil's Advocate.

346
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:40,574
- AI.
- Right.

347
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:46,372
Keanu's a lawyer, gets all turned on
by money, power and the Devil.

348
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:51,168
Then his wife says, "You're not
the man I married," leaves him.

349
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,628
You see the arc?

350
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:58,717
He starts down here, he ends up here.

351
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:01,095
Where's my arc, Paulie?

352
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:03,472
Kid...

353
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:07,726
...Richard Kimble, the Devil's
whatever, those are all make-believe.

354
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,896
I got no arc either.

355
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:16,110
I was born, grew up, spent a few years
in the Army, a few more in the can.

356
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:19,530
And here I am. A half a wiseguy.
So what?

357
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,074
I got no identity.

358
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:25,744
Even Brendan Filone's got
an identity. He's dead.

359
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:29,123
I killed that fucking Emil Kolar,
and nothing.

360
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:31,125
I don't even move up a notch.

361
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,669
All I got is nightmares.

362
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,797
That Polish, Czech,
whatever he is...

363
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:39,675
...is haunting me in my dreams
every night.

364
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:43,554
That happens. The more of them
you do, the better you'll sleep.

365
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:46,432
I had one prick for months
in my dreams.

366
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:50,936
I feel like he's trying to tell me
we fucked up the night we buried him.

367
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,980
- We didn't.
- I'm in danger.

368
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:54,440
Can I ask a question?

369
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:57,359
Why would he tell you
you're in danger...

370
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:00,529
...considering you put
a moonroof in his head?

371
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:03,282
What did we do wrong that night?

372
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:06,744
The gun was hot, so the slugs
couldn't be traced to me.

373
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:09,455
You know who had an ark?
Noah.

374
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:32,895
Is that him?

375
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:36,565
That would be some fucking
coincidence if it wasn't, wouldn't it?

376
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:42,070
- Holy shit! Look.
- What?

377
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:44,948
He was clean-shaven.
He's got a beard now.

378
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,743
You know what?
I read that. That happens.

379
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:50,078
I always thought it was bullshit.

380
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,122
Look at his fingernails!

381
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:53,957
They're like a woman's.

382
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,627
I'm gonna fucking puke.

383
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:03,967
Help me lift him and take him to Pine
Barrens before they build a condo here.

384
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,719
Georgie!

385
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:11,642
I don't know about
selling this property.

386
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:15,187
I don't know about you,
but I sure could use an infusion...

387
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:18,524
...if we're supporting Jase
after he graduates.

388
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:22,986
It's funny how even during our
marriage, we saw things differently.

389
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:27,407
I never saw this place
as an investment.

390
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,244
I always thought
that we'd build a house.

391
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,997
So are we gonna sell, or what?

392
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,375
For Jason.

393
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:40,587
I don't want to hear that you took
one of your Colleens on a cruise.

394
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,340
What's that supposed to mean,
"Colleens"?

395
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:46,844
We all know you're a sucker
for those Irish girls.

396
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:50,013
Every Italian boy
bows down to the freckles.

397
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:53,183
- I married you!
- Yeah, I was a mother figure.

398
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:55,811
Don't bust my balls
with Freud-by-numbers.

399
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,481
Don't bust my balls?
Richard, your calabrese is showing.

400
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:04,403
Are you implying by all this
I'm ashamed to be an Italian-American?

401
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:07,447
With all the poverty, starvation,
ethnic cleansing...

402
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:09,741
...and horrible shit in this world...

403
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:14,162
...you devote your energy to protecting
the dignity of Connie Francis!

404
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,793
You're worked up about my patient...

405
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:23,964
...a man who has no bearing on
who or where you are in this world.

406
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:27,259
Call him a patient.
The man's a criminal, Jennifer.

407
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:30,971
And after a while, you're gonna
get beyond psychotherapy...

408
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,307
...with its cheesy moral relativism.

409
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:37,144
Finally, you're gonna get
to good and evil. And he's evil.

410
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,585
Sorry I'm late. The alarm...

411
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,712
What is wrong with you?

412
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,756
I ain't been feeling good.

413
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:08,675
- I wipe my ass with your feelings.
- Thanks.

414
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,969
Drive the fucking car!

415
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:24,650
We're under a microscope. I hear you
shot some kid because he made you wait!

416
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:27,194
- Fucking Paulie!
- Don't blame Paulie!

417
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:31,114
Nutley PD's got a description
and a make on the car!

418
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:33,408
Why don't you leave a urine sample?

419
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,118
- If I could...
- Shut up!

420
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:38,872
Georgie comes in with vomit all over.
I ask, "What the fuck?"

421
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,249
He said you're digging up some body!

422
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,043
- I was worried...
- Shut up!

423
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:45,545
- You want to get caught.
- I want to?

424
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:49,049
Yeah. I seen it before.
That's fucking cowboy-itis.

425
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:50,759
You want to be a bad guy?

426
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:53,637
- I was worried that I didn't...
- Shut up!

427
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:02,354
Can I try and explain here?

428
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:07,567
I don't know, Tony.

429
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:12,155
It's like the regular-ness of life
is too fucking hard for me.

430
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,241
I don't know.

431
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,748
Look at you.

432
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,752
I'll bet you're sleeping all the time.

433
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:28,213
It's the only thing I still enjoy.

434
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:32,384
You know what I think?

435
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:36,096
Maybe I have cancer.

436
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,765
Remember how Jackie got?

437
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:40,642
Cancer?

438
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:44,813
Something fucking horrible
is going on inside my body.

439
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:48,233
Does this word "cancer"
pop into your mind a lot...

440
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,777
...a little bit, what?

441
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,320
Huh?

442
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:55,741
Well, I'm just thinking,
maybe you're...

443
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:58,452
...depressed.
- Me?

444
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,496
I'm no fucking mental midget.

445
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,544
Right.

446
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,174
- Watch the...
- What?

447
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:14,801
- Filter.
- Oh, fuck!

448
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:28,106
Maybe you got...

449
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:33,320
...a serotonin problem,
or whatever the fuck they call it.

450
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,572
You know about that shit?

451
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:39,993
I saw it last night on a program.

452
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:43,997
What, take fucking Prozac?
Not this skinny guinea.

453
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,169
Let me ask a question.

454
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,507
You ever think about...

455
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,009
...you know...

456
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,554
Fuck no!

457
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:02,182
Good.

458
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:08,271
Bunch of losers blowing
their skulls all over the bathroom?

459
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,566
It's fucking pathetic.

460
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:36,633
- Did you hear the doorbell?
- I'm in the middle of a game.

461
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:39,928
You'll be in the middle of
the street, you don't wise up.

462
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,316
Anthony Soprano?

463
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,735
Why are you in my yard?

464
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:57,362
The gate was open.

465
00:35:57,613 --> 00:36:00,782
I'm Agent Harris, this is
Agent Driscol. May we come in?

466
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:01,992
If I say no?

467
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,120
If we were local, we wouldn't knock.

468
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:07,747
What's your point?

469
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:11,126
We have a search warrant.
We know you have children.

470
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:16,089
Our other team's out front. We don't
traumatize kids by kicking in doors.

471
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:20,343
So why don't you take a minute
and tell them you have visitors.

472
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,235
Hmm.

473
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:46,453
Any quarters, you can keep.

474
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,622
You trying to bribe me?

475
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:52,459
Tell me what you're looking for,
I can save you time.

476
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:55,462
Any incriminating evidence
would be nice.

477
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:59,257
Dad!

478
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,594
- I have an English paper!
- You gotta be shitting me.

479
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,555
I better have all my programs
when it comes back.

480
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:06,973
Anthony!

481
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:12,312
What the hell are they doing
in my kitchen?

482
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,359
What are you doing?

483
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,402
Forgot your lunch, just ask.

484
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:20,904
I'm very sorry.

485
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:23,490
How much would you say
that bowl cost?

486
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:26,701
- I'm not cleaning that up.
- Grasso, clean that.

487
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:29,621
Grasso, ti faccio un culo così.

488
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,206
Your ass!

489
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:32,415
Hey, Tony.

490
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,709
Take it easy.
Grasso, take it easy.

491
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,545
We'll be gone in a few minutes.

492
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:39,506
Let's wait in the living room.

493
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,925
Clean up the bowl.

494
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:43,343
Come on.

495
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:54,437
I know they're doing their job,
but I'm pissed.

496
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,648
Harris wasn't so bad.

497
00:37:56,941 --> 00:38:01,111
He was the biggest sneak out of
all of them. It's part of his act.

498
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,363
That guy broke the bowl on purpose.

499
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:05,532
He was just a klutz.

500
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:07,701
What was his last name?

501
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,537
- Rizzo, Razzo, what?
- Grasso.

502
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:13,540
Grasso. You think it's a coincidence
they sent him?

503
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:17,544
If he wasn't Italian, he'd be
at the office sweeping up. Jerk.

504
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:19,921
Bet they frisk him
before he goes home.

505
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:21,381
- Why?
- Why?

506
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:24,759
Because he has a vowel
at the end of his name: Grasso.

507
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:28,179
Does he think he'll make it to the top
by arresting his own people?

508
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:29,556
Pass the moo shu.

509
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:31,725
He'll see. He'll learn.

510
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:34,769
- We have a vowel.
- And you be proud of it!

511
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:38,940
You'd think there was no Michelangelo,
the way they treat people.

512
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,568
An Italian invented the telephone.

513
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:45,780
- Alexander Graham Bell was Italian?
- You see? You see what...?

514
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:49,200
Antonio Meucci invented it,
and he got robbed!

515
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,036
Everybody knows that!

516
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,164
Who invented the Mafia?

517
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:56,041
What?

518
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:59,419
- La Cosa Nostra. Who invented that?
- Who cares.

519
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:03,256
Wasn't it Salvatore Lucania,
known as Charlie "Lucky" Luciano...

520
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:08,595
...who organized the five families:
Lucchese, Gambino, Bonanno, Profaci.

521
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:11,181
Is there something
you want to say to me?

522
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,934
I just like history, like you, Dad.

523
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,270
Can you shut the fuck up about it?

524
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:19,147
- Hey!
- Hey!

525
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:24,569
A.J., did you know
John Cabot was Italian?

526
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:27,072
- Whoa.
- Like he knows who that is.

527
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:29,282
The famous discoverer of Canada.

528
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:30,992
The Bank of America.

529
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:35,288
One of the biggest banks in the world,
started by an Italian.

530
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:38,541
The first American saint
was Italian. Mother Cabrini.

531
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:42,962
Is it true the Chinese
invented spaghetti?

532
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:46,299
Now think. Why would people
who eat with sticks...

533
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,968
...invent something
you need a fork to eat?

534
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:52,305
Here's more I bet you don't know.

535
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:56,893
More Italians fought for the U.S.
in WWII than any other ethnic group.

536
00:39:58,312 --> 00:40:00,355
They won't tell you
about Sacco and Vanzetti.

537
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:03,149
The anti-Christs
that got the electric chair?

538
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,152
- Anarchists.
- Isn't it anti-Christs?

539
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:09,614
They were innocent and got
the chair because they were Italian.

540
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:12,534
How are there two anti-Christs
and only one Christ?

541
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,160
So?

542
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:17,831
And of course, Francis Albert.

543
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:22,544
Will I see you next week?

544
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:24,337
Unless you know something I don't.

545
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:28,133
You understand, I have to charge you
for the missed session.

546
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,760
What do you mean?

547
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:33,263
We agreed on that
on our first meeting.

548
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:35,640
But I just explained my situation.

549
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:39,519
I understand, but it's important
that we respect the agreement.

550
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:44,357
- What if I got hit by a car?
- But you weren't.

551
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:47,735
- I know, but what if?
- But you weren't.

552
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,612
I know that, but what if?

553
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:52,240
- You weren't.
- Answer my fucking question!

554
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:54,742
I will not.

555
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:56,244
You won't?

556
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,038
All right, fine.

557
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:01,708
Fine, here. Here you go.

558
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:05,545
This is what it's all about.
Motherfucking, cocksucking money!

559
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:06,921
Here!

560
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:13,761
I don't understand that, and I don't
appreciate being made to feel afraid.

561
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:17,557
I don't appreciate feeling like
I pour my heart to a call girl!

562
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:20,602
- Is that how you see me?
- Not until now.

563
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:24,772
But it's obvious you don't give a shit
about my situation.

564
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:27,233
Otherwise, you wouldn't
shake me down.

565
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,989
It'll show as paid
on your next bill.

566
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,365
Fine.

567
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:37,076
Stick it up your ass.

568
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:48,129
And how about Dr. Goldman here?

569
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:52,759
He was gonna be a tree surgeon,
but he fainted at the sight of sap!

570
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,802
Sap, ladies and gentlemen.

571
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:58,973
Pace yourselves.
Don't spend it all in one place.

572
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:03,269
Movie night, right? Last week they
showed the Polish version of Rashomon.

573
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:06,606
Everybody remembers the rape
exactly the same!

574
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:10,693
What's the matter with you, Corrado?

575
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:14,906
Headaches, that's all.
Not the kind you take aspirin for.

576
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:19,369
Now, tonight on our show, we have
Mitzi Gaynor, Sergio Franchi...

577
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:23,957
...and a woman from France will pull
light bulbs from her husband's throat.

578
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,750
This woman can relate.

579
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,585
We may have a bad apple.

580
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:30,588
Does Tony know about this?

581
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:32,298
What will you do?

582
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:35,385
There's not much to do.
We sit back and wait.

583
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:39,806
Don't let Tony know you know.
He's under enough pressure.

584
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,808
Yeah.

585
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:46,354
I'm sure he's telling his psychiatrist
it's all his mother's fault.

586
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:47,981
What, a psychiatrist?

587
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:51,609
Yeah, a psychiatrist.

588
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:54,612
He's been seeing one for a while now.

589
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:58,533
God only knows what he says.

590
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:01,411
- Tony?
- Yes, Tony.

591
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:04,998
Tony, who had such a terrible mother.

592
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:06,708
A psychiatrist?

593
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:10,295
Yes, Junior. For chrissake!

594
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:14,549
Show of hands, how many people think
J.F.K is still alive? Come on.

595
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:19,971
They should take a Zapruder film of
your salad bar. Hello? Help me out!

596
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,307
Who? The psychiatrist, I mean.

597
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:24,559
Do you think I know?

598
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:27,687
- What did you say to Tony about this?
- Me?

599
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,355
Nothing.

600
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:32,358
I wouldn't give him the satisfaction.

601
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:37,697
And, Junior, I don't want
there to be any repercussions.

602
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,534
A psychiatrist?

603
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:46,539
You're a broken record.
Yes, yes!

604
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,750
- Do I have to...?
- Shh!

605
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:55,214
Do I have to say it again?

606
00:43:57,718 --> 00:44:02,013
Picture yourself
at Ellis Island. How does that sound?

607
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:08,603
It's me. Leave a message.

608
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:11,481
Christopher? It's Mommy.

609
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:13,983
I know you're there. Pick it up.

610
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:17,779
Are you all right?
I'm worried about you.

611
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:22,617
My God, they mentioned your name
in the newspaper. The Star-Ledger.

612
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:26,913
Mrs. Jones told me.
With all those scumbags!

613
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:30,416
It's been a while
since we met for therapy.

614
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:35,838
Jason, how's Bard?

615
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:42,345
I'm moving into a smoke-free dorm.

616
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,933
And how do we feel about that?

617
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:50,019
I'm interested
in discussing what we mentioned.

618
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:54,065
Jason, are you concerned that your
mother is treating this patient X?

619
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:57,944
I don't care.

620
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:03,157
As a colleague, Jen,
I suggest you drop the patient.

621
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:05,118
After her last encounter...

622
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:06,911
...she finally acknowledged...

623
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:10,289
...that she saw the different side
of him, the subhuman.

624
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,625
I take it you were frightened.

625
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:15,461
Frightened, revolted.

626
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,547
At last, appropriate emotions.

627
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:20,174
Oh, for chrissake, Richard.
You too, Sam.

628
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:23,428
When did we become afraid
to get our hands dirty?

629
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:25,304
It's what she gets paid for.

630
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:28,307
Jason, how would you like
to see your mother?

631
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:34,188
Never mind, I'm not gonna paint
any graphic images.

632
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:37,191
See? He always does that.

633
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:38,443
What?

634
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:41,738
Follow that up, Jase. Dad does what?

635
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:44,824
His issue is that I should
distance myself from this man...

636
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:47,827
...on the grounds of the stigma
that he brings us.

637
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:51,706
I say refer this patient
to a therapist...

638
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:56,002
...that specializes
in Mafia depression.

639
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:00,798
This isn't funny.

640
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:02,717
No, of course not.

641
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:09,557
Jen has a real honest to goodness
personal and professional dilemma.

642
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:17,273
You know, on my mother's side,
we have a few dark sheep.

643
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:18,733
Excuse me?

644
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:21,736
Lepke.

645
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:28,075
Who's Lepke?

646
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:31,537
Louis "Lepke" Buchalter.

647
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,707
You know. Murder, Incorporated.

648
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:40,546
My mother's uncle
was Lepke's wheelman.

649
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:42,381
His driver.

650
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:45,051
Uh-huh?

651
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:49,055
Those were some tough Jews.
