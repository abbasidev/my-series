1
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,524
Debbie, you got magic fingers.

2
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:51,485
I bet you give a great hand job.

3
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:52,820
Yeah, she does.

4
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,613
Hey, here's my baby.

5
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:58,075
Debbie, you gotta put her
on the A list. Really.

6
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,494
She rides better
than Willie Shoemaker.

7
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:02,871
- Did she go to the whip?
- He's so crazy.

8
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,832
Only in the homestretch.

9
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:09,461
Another satisfied customer.

10
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:12,297
I think he's having a heart attack!

11
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,053
Don't move.

12
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:21,014
Go see if Dr. Mop-N-Glo is still here.

13
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:23,934
- Dr. Mop-N-Glo?
- Who?

14
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,228
Don't worry, he's a real doctor.

15
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:27,479
Dermatologist.

16
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,106
What's the matter?

17
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,733
Dr. Edelstein,
looks like a heart attack.

18
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:33,902
I don't need no doctor.

19
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,280
It's just my back.

20
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,073
Nice and slow.

21
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:43,287
Grab the rail, grab the rail.
That's right.

22
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,957
Go easy, go easy now. That's it.

23
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,542
Nice and easy.

24
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,294
Nice and easy.

25
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,296
That's it, that's it.

26
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,673
Come on, that's it.

27
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:56,925
Hold the rail.

28
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,640
Go slow, go slow.

29
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,649
Eighty to you.

30
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:18,113
Fuck this.

31
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,115
Your back still bothering you?

32
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,826
Yeah?

33
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,079
FBI! Nobody move!

34
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,956
You believe this shit?

35
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,920
- Come on, it's a friendly card game.
- Relax, Jimmy.

36
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:36,840
If I wanted to bust up card games,
I'd have a doughnut in my mouth.

37
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,942
Derek, give him a hand.

38
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,494
Hey! Hey!

39
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,412
- Get him!
- You! You!

40
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:15,420
Oh, my goodness.
Do you know what this is?

41
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,047
It's a fucking gun!

42
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,561
Fucking Jimmy's still in jail.

43
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:32,896
Don't mean shit.

44
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,691
I don't like it.
This is how it starts.

45
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:37,484
I think it was a potluck raid.

46
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:39,653
Make it look like
they're earning their pay.

47
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:40,821
I agree.

48
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,823
But why would Pussy run?

49
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:46,034
He's out of breath lifting his dick
to take a leak.

50
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:50,122
Oh, Puss!

51
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:51,999
Your ears must be ringing.

52
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,417
Come on, run!

53
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,629
Ha, ha. You guys are a fucking riot.

54
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:01,550
We were gonna draw straws
to see who'd bail you out.

55
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,386
My wife did. I nearly
strangled her on the ride home.

56
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:08,223
My head's hurting, I got agita,
and on top of that...

57
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,267
...I threw my back out again.

58
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,894
Maybe it was that 10-yard dash.

59
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:15,355
We don't run. It's embarrassing.

60
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:18,025
- Those Federal pricks robbed me.
- What?

61
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,861
They grabbed four dimes from me.

62
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,280
You shouldn't carry that type of cash!

63
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,033
Never mind, I need a drink.

64
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,078
Oh, Madonna! Che puzzo!

65
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,664
Oh, Jesus!

66
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,013
This better be good.
I was fishing.

67
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:51,266
What, no "How you been?
How's it doing, Vin?"

68
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,518
I thought we understood each other.

69
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:57,481
I don't care about you, your family
or whether you take it up the ass.

70
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:00,567
What's so important
you take me away from my boat?

71
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,819
Fuckface, where you going?

72
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:06,073
Why do you talk to me like this?
I do risky shit for you.

73
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:08,950
You're not doing
charity work, remember?

74
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,455
All right, I'm sorry.

75
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:17,667
Hey, Vin, how you doing?
What do you got for me?

76
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,381
Bompensiero.

77
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,548
Pussy?

78
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,300
What about him?

79
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,844
He's wired for sound.

80
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,137
What?

81
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:33,642
I got it from a good source.
I thought you should know. All right?

82
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:36,561
- I'm sorry. I know you like him.
- Like him?

83
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:39,147
I fucking love him.

84
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,149
Now, who's your source?

85
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,320
He's on the force.
He's on the Task Force, all right?

86
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,824
Look, he's not lying to me.
He was in my wedding.

87
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,659
I want to see the report.

88
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,036
- I can't...
- I want to see the fucking 302!

89
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:56,164
All right, all right.
I'll see what I can do.

90
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,631
It doesn't make any sense.

91
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:08,343
Yeah, it does, Tone,
if you take the blinders off.

92
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:14,057
I'm in Homicide. I was told he moved
heavy H to pay for his kid's college.

93
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:16,643
Why would I know something like that?

94
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,855
Last spring, with that
big heroin bust, where was he?

95
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:23,024
He told you he was
in Las Vegas. Am I right?

96
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:26,278
I'm sorry, but that's where he was.
He was in Las Vegas.

97
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:29,406
He was in a Federal building,
cutting a deal.

98
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:34,035
Why did he walk so easy
from that thing the other day?

99
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,912
Known wiseguy, resisted arrest.

100
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,624
Who walks away from a thing like that
with low-ball bail?

101
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,419
Why would he do it?

102
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:46,923
He's facing a possible sentence
of "from now on," mandatory.

103
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:50,677
I know a lot of guys
who can't do that kind of time.

104
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,679
Who is this guy Pussy?

105
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:56,016
He's a man who loves his family
above all else.

106
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:59,019
Well, guess what?
That's their favorite target.

107
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,901
Ma, you sure?
Because I'd be glad to...

108
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,112
No, I...

109
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,948
Okay, that's fine.

110
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,452
I just said it's fine.

111
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,754
- Was that my mother?
- She's not coming.

112
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:29,007
- Like you expected different?
- I hoped.

113
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:32,344
Every year we have open house,
and she pulls the same shit.

114
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,554
It's negative attention-getting.

115
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,431
Maybe I should call her back.

116
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,267
That's what she wants you to do.
Come here.

117
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:42,103
You're being too nice.

118
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,481
Forget about her, she'll be fine.

119
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:48,360
Can you get the guys to help you
move the piano?

120
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,696
They're coming to get it,
because some people don't play.

121
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:55,116
- I will.
- When? It's been gathering dust.

122
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,494
Oh, Puss! Come here!

123
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,956
Excuse me.

124
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:06,294
What do you need?

125
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:09,464
We gotta move this.
I want to slide it out of the way.

126
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,138
I can't.

127
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,140
The fucking thing's on wheels.

128
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:23,144
My back. I'm thinking about
going home, sitting in the tub.

129
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,147
You all right?

130
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,026
Yeah, it's just my back.
They got me on these elephant pills.

131
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:37,117
All right, go easy on them.

132
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,995
Go ahead, sit down. Take it easy.

133
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,423
Keep your eye on Pussy.
Something's wrong. He's not himself.

134
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,216
You're telling me?

135
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,094
He hasn't done his rounds
in a week.

136
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,680
He's starting to look like
an easy mark.

137
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:03,351
I told him, "Someone owes you money,
even if you gotta crawl, you get it."

138
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:07,939
I even told him to give me his list,
and I'll collect the fucking thing.

139
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:11,443
- What'd he say?
- He just nodded like a fucking retard.

140
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,028
It's those fucking Percs.

141
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,530
He's throwing them
in his mouth like M&M's.

142
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:18,366
There isn't even anything wrong
with his back.

143
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:20,869
What do you mean?

144
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:25,290
Remember when that guy hit me with
a pool cue and I fucked my neck up?

145
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,167
- Down at the Shore.
- Right.

146
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:31,838
I went to this doctor. He works on
the Jets when they get hurt.

147
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,214
That so?

148
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,760
He's fucking like the Jonas Salk
of backs. Anyway...

149
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:40,347
...I send Pussy to this doctor.
The guy gives him the works:

150
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,142
MRIs, CAT scans, DOG scans,
you name it.

151
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:47,062
He says there's not a thing wrong
with his back.

152
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,609
Then again, he says,
when it comes to backs...

153
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,362
...nobody knows anything, really.

154
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:58,615
You know, I was on a good run,
and then, boom!

155
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:02,452
It's like I'm walking
down the street...

156
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:07,290
...and I'm looking up because I feel
like a safe's gonna land on my head.

157
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,501
A feeling of pending doom?

158
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,544
Let me ask you a question.

159
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:16,299
This mental stuff can cause
physical problems, right?

160
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,677
Are you having any physical problems?

161
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,470
No, no, I'm fine.

162
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,223
But I got a friend...

163
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:27,977
...a dear, dear friend,
and I'm concerned about him.

164
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,771
What's wrong with him?

165
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,314
It's his back.

166
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:35,276
See, he's complaining
about his back...

167
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,904
...but the doctor thinks
it's all in his head.

168
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,240
That's very possible.

169
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,701
What do you think?

170
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,453
I think we should just
keep this about you.

171
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,080
This is about me.

172
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:52,252
Every time I offer my opinion
about any of your friends...

173
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:55,922
...it seems to interfere
with our therapy.

174
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,843
You start cursing and screaming.

175
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:04,723
What kind of mental stuff
would cause a backache?

176
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,850
For conversation's sake?

177
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,643
Absolutely.

178
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,898
With some people, the pain is...

179
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:18,528
...caused by more responsibility
than they can handle.

180
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,406
Well, that makes sense. I mean...

181
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:26,035
...he's got a lot of bills, a lot of
problems with his kid's school fund.

182
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:28,288
Secrets.

183
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,041
What do you mean?

184
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:35,754
Psychologically,
a secret is a heavy load.

185
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:40,133
It leads to feelings of guilt,
which further burden the mind.

186
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:55,106
If you want my opinion,
this can't be true.

187
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:56,858
Thanks, Debbie.

188
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:05,909
You know, I told you that
I would do what I could...

189
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:10,705
...but this is DEA, Feds, Task Force.

190
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,458
This is not as easy as you think.

191
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,543
Getting my hands on the 302.

192
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,462
Now, you listen to me.

193
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:21,090
This is the most serious decision
I've ever had to make.

194
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,092
And I need proof.

195
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:27,055
I won't hurt a man that I love
because of some cop gossip...

196
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:30,225
...from a degenerate fucking gambler
with a badge.

197
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:34,354
You know, you got
an amazing ability to sum up...

198
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:37,440
...a man's whole life
in a single sentence.

199
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:41,069
Degenerate gambler with a badge, huh?

200
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,739
You're a pisser.
You're a real pisser.

201
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:48,743
I'm under pressure.
I don't have time to suck your dick!

202
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:50,954
Apology accepted.

203
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,831
- Fuck you!
- Fuck me?

204
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,040
Yeah, fuck you!

205
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,837
You know, when I was a kid...

206
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:03,216
When I was a kid and my old man
would be in one of his ways...

207
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,927
...with the screaming
back and forth...

208
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,013
...it'd end with her
throwing the closest thing to her.

209
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,724
He'd smack her around!

210
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,895
I don't know why...

211
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:20,275
...but I would run into my room,
and I would hide under my bed.

212
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:25,905
There was something peaceful, and
something safe under that bed.

213
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:30,285
And that's where I would wake up
the next day.

214
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:33,997
Everything back to normal.

215
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:36,749
How about you?

216
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,962
Do you ever feel like
hiding under a bed?

217
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,550
Yeah. Right now.

218
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,557
You're a prick to the end, right?

219
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,232
You really like this place, huh?

220
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,818
It's my getaway.

221
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,946
This is where Debbie's
taken care of me for years.

222
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,823
I'll bet she has.

223
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:11,200
I'm serious, she has.

224
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,871
There were times when I had
a great weekend with the football...

225
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:18,541
...and I'd come here with
a pocketful of money, shitfaced...

226
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:22,545
...and every fucking penny would be
there when I got up in the morning.

227
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,340
She is an honest lady.

228
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,675
She'd do anything for you, anything.

229
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:31,346
You come in here, you flash
your badge, you get free pussy.

230
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:35,516
Fuck pussy. I wouldn't fuck
one of these broads with your dick.

231
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:39,812
They have absolutely no class,
and they're always on the hustle.

232
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,523
That's what
they're supposed to do, no?

233
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:59,040
"Oh, hello, Carmela.
How nice to see you."

234
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:01,876
How are you feeling?

235
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,671
Oh, what can I say? What's that?

236
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,882
It's a ricotta pie.
I saved it from the open house.

237
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,676
Are you wearing makeup?

238
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:11,970
I can't eat that.
It's got cholesterol!

239
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,847
I made it with the low-fat cheese.

240
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:17,225
Yuck.

241
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,895
Well, maybe your friends
will eat it.

242
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,398
What friends?

243
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:26,734
Fine, you can eat it
when Junior visits.

244
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,365
You know,
your son loves you very much.

245
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:34,909
He worries all the time.

246
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,079
He felt bad that
you didn't come to the open house.

247
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,915
I don't care if
you think it's disrespectful...

248
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:44,377
...but I want you to cut the drama.
It's killing Tony.

249
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:45,920
What are you talking about?

250
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,632
I'm talking about this
"Poor mother, nobody loves me" crap.

251
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,718
It is textbook manipulation...

252
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:54,679
...and I hate seeing
Tony so upset over it.

253
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:57,223
I know how to talk to people.

254
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:00,268
Well, I am a mother too,
don't forget.

255
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:04,147
You know your power,
and you use it like a pro.

256
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:08,609
Power, what power?
I don't have power. I'm a shut-in!

257
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,361
You are bigger than life!

258
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:11,946
You are his mother!

259
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,907
I think that
you know what you're doing.

260
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:17,702
Who, me? What did I do?

261
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:21,080
Look, I didn't come by to argue.

262
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:24,709
I came by to check on you
and to bring you the ricotta.

263
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:28,755
If you don't want it, give it
to Junior. I know he stops by a lot.

264
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,424
He's my husband's brother.

265
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:34,677
He can't check up on me
once in a while?

266
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,888
That's none of anybody's business.

267
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,431
I am not saying that.

268
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:41,434
I'm saying if you don't want it,
give it to Junior.

269
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:43,811
I know what you're hinting at.

270
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:47,065
Ma, there is nothing wrong
with companionship!

271
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,487
What is wrong?

272
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,913
Wait until you're abandoned.

273
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,752
Abandoned? Please!

274
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,758
When Johnny was alive...

275
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,220
...nobody treated me like this.

276
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,306
What are you talking about?
Who is treating you bad?

277
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,934
Tony would rather die
than see you hurt.

278
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,853
Johnny was a saint.

279
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,146
Yes, we heard.

280
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:30,691
Funny, I don't remember you
telling him that when he was alive.

281
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,861
Junior couldn't carry Johnny's socks.

282
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:37,115
Do you think I'd blacken
my Johnny's memory...

283
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:40,535
...by getting mixed up
with his brother?

284
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,288
I didn't say that.

285
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:47,708
We're only happy
you and Junior get along so well.

286
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,377
At least with Junior...

287
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,550
...I've got some purpose in life.

288
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:01,139
Somebody listens to me,
and doesn't treat me like an old shoe!

289
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:08,688
Jesus!

290
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:15,611
Don't worry about the dish.
I'll come back tomorrow and get it.

291
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,495
Hey, college boy!

292
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,627
Yo, Dad! It's Uncle Tony.

293
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,467
There he is, the beached whale!

294
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:41,470
Hey, Tony, what are you doing here?

295
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:44,473
I figured you'd be having
a cannoli withdrawal by now.

296
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:45,808
Spinellis?

297
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:48,436
No, Stop 'N' Shop. What do you think?

298
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:52,064
Hey, you're the best.
Hey, Kev, put those on a dish.

299
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,442
Wait till after supper.

300
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,904
Your dad tells me you're
taking astronomy in college.

301
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:59,280
No, business.

302
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:02,575
How come he keeps saying
you're taking up space in school?

303
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:07,121
Madonna! Don't make me laugh.
It kills my back.

304
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,207
He's a good-looking kid.

305
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,416
Sure he's yours?

306
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:13,794
You're lucky my wife's not home.
She'd toss you out for that.

307
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,254
I know.

308
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,131
That's a good boy.

309
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,134
I pray to God I keep
that tuition coming in.

310
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:21,969
He can go to city college.

311
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:26,474
He's staying where he is. He isn't
getting fucked because his old man is!

312
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:33,439
You ought to relax.
You ought to take it easy a little.

313
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,484
Take it easy.
How the fuck can I take it easy?

314
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,444
Things are happening, Tony.

315
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,238
What kind of things?

316
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,739
Things!

317
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:46,744
This back has taken me
out of the game. I'm behind.

318
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:50,456
And I think I'm getting hooked
on these fucking painkillers!

319
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,709
I don't know, I feel like
someone put the malocchio on me.

320
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:57,630
Puss...

321
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,091
...you got options.

322
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,927
Don't let anyone make you feel...

323
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:06,097
...like you don't have options
because you got friends.

324
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,765
Look at me.

325
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:10,226
Friends that would die for you.

326
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,061
You understand me?

327
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:13,938
Friends.

328
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,482
Yeah, I know.

329
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,406
You got anything
you want to say to me?

330
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,492
Like what?

331
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,416
Like, "You want some coffee?
You want something to eat?"

332
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,626
- You want coffee?
- Yeah.

333
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:39,463
You think I'd let you eat
those cannolis by yourself?

334
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,048
You beached whale.

335
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:42,466
- Here.
- What?

336
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,885
Help me.
Who'll make the coffee, you?

337
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:47,888
One, two, three.

338
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,142
You look good.

339
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,750
What's up, T?

340
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:17,710
Sit.

341
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:21,547
Fucking traffic!

342
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,050
I would have been here 20 minutes ago.

343
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:27,011
Want a drink?

344
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:28,429
Nah.

345
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:31,932
You okay?

346
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,146
He's wearing a wire.

347
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:38,814
Who?

348
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,274
Pussy.

349
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:43,861
Oh, get the fuck out of here.
Our Pussy?

350
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,946
Don't know how long.

351
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:48,574
Are you sure about this, Tony?

352
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:51,369
Ninety percent.

353
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:55,331
Not enough to do
what needs to be done.

354
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,875
Jesus!
I'm fucking dreaming here.

355
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,960
Well, get used to it.

356
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:03,089
I've been walking into walls all week.

357
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,097
I'll do it.

358
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,312
My responsibility.

359
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,774
You waited a long time
for the stripes.

360
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:23,943
This is one of the perks.

361
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:26,821
I'll do it.

362
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:38,082
We need to be 110 percent sure.

363
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,751
I want you to see it.

364
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:44,296
I want you to see that fucking wire
strapped on his body.

365
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,215
I want you to see it.

366
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:47,883
You hear me?

367
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,718
I want you to see it.

368
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:53,305
Otherwise, all bets are off.

369
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:55,850
You understand?

370
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,274
This is our friend
we're talking about here.

371
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,025
You say it.

372
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,528
You understand?

373
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,197
I understand.

374
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,555
Come in.

375
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:38,434
Mr. Soprano.

376
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:42,480
- Are you busy?
- No, no, no. Come in, please.

377
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:50,029
I was in the neighborhood,
figured I'd stop by and see my mother.

378
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:53,115
Brought her some Mario Lanza.

379
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,494
She loves the old guys.

380
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:04,168
I'm a little worried about her.
You know, she's always been depressed.

381
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:07,880
Sometimes these half-assed tenors
can really do the trick.

382
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:16,430
You know where she is?
She's not in her room.

383
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:19,475
I wanted to tell her
her house went into escrow.

384
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:22,478
She's with the other girls
getting aqua therapy.

385
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:23,938
My mother?

386
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:27,650
The physical therapist told her
if she didn't get exercise...

387
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:30,110
...her back was gonna arch
like an old lady.

388
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:32,029
I didn't know
she had a bathing suit.

389
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,281
She's more connected to the world.

390
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:36,283
Which one, this one or Neptune?

391
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:39,119
No, really.

392
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:43,791
I think your uncle's visits
have a lot to do with it.

393
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,668
Oh, she looks forward to them.

394
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:48,796
Could you excuse me one moment?

395
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:52,132
Yeah, sure. You know, just...

396
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:56,554
Tell her her house sold
and they accepted the counteroffer.

397
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:59,306
Okay. Yeah, I'll be right there.

398
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:02,560
- I'm leaving, guys.
- See you later, Pussy.

399
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:06,480
- I'll tell you if a horse runs.
- Don't do me any favors.

400
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:39,179
Follow me.

401
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:41,181
Where?

402
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,058
It's a surprise.

403
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:48,480
Come on, you hard-on,
before we get a ticket.

404
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,870
Paulie, I've been here before.
What the fuck you want?

405
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:05,372
Look around,
I'll give you three guesses.

406
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,458
Come on, down here.

407
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,547
We'll grab a rubdown after.

408
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:15,466
Here.

409
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:18,510
I don't know.

410
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:21,221
Come on, get undressed.
It's on me.

411
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:24,350
Why do you think
those Russians live so long?

412
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:27,019
They take a schvitz every day.

413
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,479
I can't.

414
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:31,857
Don't be like that.
It's a gift. Take your clothes off.

415
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:34,151
What? Want me to turn around?

416
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:38,572
The doctor said heat's no good for me.
That's why I sit in the shade.

417
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:41,867
What are you talking about?
Heat is good for your back!

418
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,911
Take your clothes off!

419
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:47,581
Look, Paulie, I appreciate it.
Maybe another time, huh?

420
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,376
Take your clothes off.

421
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:54,505
You're fucking crazy.
I'm going home.

422
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:59,760
Why don't you want
to take your clothes off?

423
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:04,264
I got high blood pressure!
I go in there, I could check out!

424
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:07,893
My doctor mentioned steam and sauna
specifically as no-noes.

425
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:10,604
He said stay the fuck
away from heat!

426
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:15,609
Thanks for the thought.
But get out of my fucking face.

427
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:38,507
What'd you find out?

428
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,261
It's good. It's fucking very good!

429
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:44,513
Spit it out.

430
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,015
He's into Pussy, big.

431
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:49,518
And I mean with a capital B.

432
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:53,689
This fucking Makazian,
he's a lying motherfucker!

433
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:58,527
He's into Pussy for 30 large.
Twenty grand, just on football!

434
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:00,529
And the rest is shy.

435
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:04,116
Pussy must be burying his prick
in vig alone.

436
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,876
Doesn't mean he's a liar.

437
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:18,505
Just means he's got a reason to see
Pussy dead. It buys him time.

438
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:24,178
Could this prick have the balls
to try something like this?

439
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:27,014
Hey, we're talking about
30 grand here!

440
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:30,851
I don't even want to think about
what we'd do to remove that debt.

441
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,020
I wouldn't bet football.

442
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:39,109
I gotta think about this.

443
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:42,446
Look, T...

444
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:44,948
...if my vote counts for anything...

445
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,869
...I cannot believe that
Pussy would fear the can enough...

446
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,038
...to hurt his friends.

447
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:54,958
That's what they said about Gravano.

448
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:01,048
All right, go back in.
I gotta think.

449
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,562
Deb?

450
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:19,733
Debbie?

451
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,870
- Take it easy with her.
- I'd think a whore would like pain.

452
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,747
- Take it easy!
- Vinnie, stop it!

453
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,458
Come on, let's get
this show on the road!

454
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:39,461
Look at this. A doctor,
a madam, a wiseguy and a cop.

455
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,422
That's what I call a vice superfecta.

456
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:50,430
The four were arrested last night.

457
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:54,226
A spokesman says that the officer
in question will be placed on leave...

458
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:57,354
...pending the outcome
of the hearing this morning.

459
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:59,565
Hate to be there
when he got home.

460
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,316
I don't know which is worse:

461
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:05,153
To be caught in a bordello
or to be caught with the wiseguy.

462
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:07,906
Asshole!

463
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:11,034
- What's a bordello?
- A fancy name for a whorehouse.

464
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,661
Don't start, okay?

465
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:13,912
It is!

466
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,956
I just don't like that talk.

467
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:20,252
Most civilized countries
have legalized prostitution.

468
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:21,795
You got somewhere to be?

469
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,006
It's a joke, look at the president.

470
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,632
He deserved what he got.

471
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:28,802
He got Monica Kazinski
and the broad with the long nose.

472
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,138
Sex shouldn't be
a punishable offense.

473
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:34,516
I don't think sex should be
a punishable offense either.

474
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:38,812
But talking about sex at the breakfast
table is a punishable offense.

475
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:40,689
No more sex talk, okay?

476
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:44,651
It's the '90s, parents are supposed
to discuss sex with their children.

477
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,820
But that's where you're wrong.

478
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:50,824
You see, out there, it's the 1990s,
but in this house...

479
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,826
...it's 1954.

480
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:55,996
1990s, 1954.

481
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:59,708
So now and forever, I don't want
to hear any more sex talk.

482
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,214
What's with him?

483
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:19,186
Keep moving, please.

484
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,605
Come on!

485
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:41,041
Come on, goddamn it!

486
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,043
Come on, let's go, let's go!

487
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:45,170
Let's go!

488
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,222
Go ahead, detective.

489
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:58,934
Excuse me, move it out, please.
Got a police officer here.

490
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:02,854
Move it out! Let's go! Pull up!

491
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,651
Police vehicle! Coming through!

492
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:57,034
Are you sure? Who told you this?

493
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,328
What?

494
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:08,045
Yeah, yeah, I'm still here.

495
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:12,632
All right, thanks.
I'll talk to you later.

496
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:17,846
You gonna tell me?

497
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:21,641
The fucking jerk did a header
off the Route 1 bridge.

498
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:24,102
- Who?
- Makazian.

499
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:26,438
Fuck!

500
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:31,651
There goes our only shot to find out
for sure the truth about Pussy.

501
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:39,493
Well, if it matters, he always said
how much he respected you.

502
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:41,203
It matters.

503
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:49,336
He helped me out of a lot of jams.
Not just with the law.

504
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:52,672
What was he thinking?

505
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,343
He could've kept his job. He might
have been suspended, that's all.

506
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:58,095
It's not like he was dealing.

507
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,222
That's not why he did it.

508
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:04,226
Don't get me wrong,
it was the straw...

509
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:06,728
...but he was not happy...

510
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:09,940
...with himself, how he turned out.

511
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,692
What did he come here for, therapy?

512
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:15,070
You could say that.

513
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:17,447
Instead of a couch, you use a bed?

514
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:19,032
It's not a bad deal.

515
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,743
Who wouldn't want to
sleep with their shrink?

516
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:26,706
What's that mean?

517
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:32,045
You'd be amazed how easy
it is to open up when you're naked...

518
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:35,048
...and in the arms
of someone who cares for you.

519
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:40,428
Did he ever mention anything
about my guys to you?

520
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:45,058
He didn't like Paulie.
He thought he was a psycho.

521
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:46,852
What about Pussy?

522
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:50,522
He really didn't have much to say
about any of you guys.

523
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:55,735
Except that he owed some money.

524
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,822
But he wasn't worried because
you liked him...

525
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:04,703
...and while he had you in his corner,
there was nothing to worry about.

526
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:10,709
I won't lie, he's dead. He didn't
have a good thing to say about anyone.

527
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:13,753
He did feel like he could trust you.

528
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:21,720
He said a lot, "At least with Tony
Soprano, you know where you stand."

529
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:33,148
Livia, open up, it's Junior!

530
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:36,526
Come on in, it's open.

531
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,114
What's going on?

532
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:44,034
My Dominican girl said you called me.

533
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,494
Well...

534
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,623
...he sold our house.

535
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:53,126
- Don't people have names? Who's "he"?
- Anthony.

536
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:55,921
He sold my house!

537
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:59,216
The home my husband and I made!

538
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,927
What else were they gonna do with it?

539
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:03,803
You too!

540
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,513
Hey.

541
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:11,770
I suppose he would've found it harder
to have his meetings at my house...

542
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:14,022
...than in this nursing home.

543
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:16,149
What are you talking about?

544
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,653
Don't think I'll ever see
any of that money, either.

545
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:20,987
What meetings?

546
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:23,114
Raymond, Larry!

547
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:25,867
That sneak from Manhattan.

548
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:28,495
Johnny Sack? Johnny Sack was here?

549
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:31,665
With his mohair suits
and his shoe lifts.

550
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:34,209
Suits, pleurisy?

551
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:38,171
More than once he was there?
Why didn't I know about this?

552
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:41,925
Maybe it was you they were
talking about, who knows?

553
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:54,104
Well, I just don't like being put
in the middle of things!

554
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:58,108
I should've known
something was strange...

555
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:02,612
...when suddenly Larry Boy's
mother moved in here.

556
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:06,199
And then Jimmy Altieri's mother.

557
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:09,035
Three of my capos
have their moms here?

558
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:13,123
Instead of living in normal homes
with their sons...

559
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,874
...like human beings.

560
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,669
This must be some kind
of fucking end move.

561
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,839
What do they think, I'm stupid?

562
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:22,757
- We'll see.
- Wait a minute!

563
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,720
I don't like that kind of talk!

564
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:29,472
Now just stop it, it upsets me!

565
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:33,435
Or I won't tell you anything anymore.

566
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:37,897
If this is true, Livia,
you know what I... I mean...

567
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:42,944
I'm the boss, for chrissake!
If I don't act, blood or no...

568
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:52,912
I have to.

569
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:55,623
Oh, God, why?

570
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:58,710
What did I say now?

571
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:09,137
I suppose I should've just kept
my mouth shut, like a mute.

572
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:12,432
And then everybody
would've been happy.

573
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,528
Anthony, see who's there.

574
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:26,946
I'm eating.

575
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:30,450
You won't have any teeth left
if you don't go see!

576
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,459
Make sure you know who it is
before you answer.

577
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:42,420
Who is coming at dinner?
People can't call?

578
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,465
It's Uncle Jimmy!

579
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:48,468
Uncle Jimmy? Let him in!

580
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:55,642
I don't believe it,
how'd you get out?

581
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:58,311
Carm, look who's here!
Jimmy, he's out!

582
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,438
Oh, my God, Jimmy!

583
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:03,149
- Thought you'd never see me again?
- What happened?

584
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:07,028
- Got someplace in private we can talk?
- Yeah, in the basement.

585
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,284
What's going on?

586
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,455
You got a problem!

587
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:22,085
Yeah, I know. I'm working on it.

588
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:23,920
Working on what?

589
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,673
Why, what were you gonna say?

590
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:29,676
You better lay low
with that safe-house money.

591
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,052
What?

592
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:34,139
They were asking me
a lot of questions in there.

593
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:38,309
If I knew anything about the dead
Colombian in the apartment.

594
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:45,024
You look good.

595
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:49,529
- Thanks, I wasn't gone that long.
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

596
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:53,867
My lawyer told him,
"Hey, he doesn't own the building.

597
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,661
He's not responsible
for what's in it."

598
00:40:56,871 --> 00:41:00,373
I told him the pool table was there
when I first rented the joint.

599
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,667
Good thinking.

600
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:04,627
You should've been a lawyer.

601
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:08,506
Please, enough people hate me.

602
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:14,262
So what are you gonna do
about the Colombian money?

603
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:20,810
They were putting it to me
like I was a kid.

604
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,021
Telling me the money was marked.

605
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:28,067
They said there's a new fingerprint
technique, lifts them off the bills.

606
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:34,657
You're a lucky man, Jimmy!

607
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:36,117
What do you mean?

608
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:38,870
You're out on bail
on that conspiracy thing?

609
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,163
Yeah, so?

610
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:43,917
Only you would get pinched with a gun
while you're out on bail...

611
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:46,252
...and still be out
in time for dinner.

612
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,923
You're a lucky guy!

613
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:53,468
Speaking of dinner, Carmela's
got some lasagna upstairs.

614
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:57,597
I'll pass. I got a few people
to see that are late with payments.

615
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:01,434
I gotta show my face or they'll
think they're off the hook.

616
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:11,361
Get off the phone!

617
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:12,904
I gotta go!

618
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:16,282
- What's up?
- It's Jimmy! It's fucking Jimmy!

619
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:17,659
What?

620
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:20,995
- The wire, it's Jimmy!
- What are you talking about?

621
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:24,958
The wire, you understand?
The wire, it's fucking Jimmy!

622
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:29,629
I should've killed him
right in my fucking basement!

623
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:33,299
Makazian's guy got mixed up.
They got busted at the same time.

624
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:36,636
Jimmy and Pussy! You understand?

625
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:41,724
Two fat fucks with black hair!
Where the fuck is Paulie?

626
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:45,311
He called an hour ago.
He said he's on his way.

627
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,647
Why the fuck isn't he here now?

628
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:51,651
Jesus, Tony.

629
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,654
You don't think Paulie
jumped the gun?

630
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,656
Shut up. God forbid.

631
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:58,866
Don't talk like that.

632
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:02,829
Where's Pussy? Get him on the phone.

633
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:08,710
I haven't seen him since
Paulie took him to the schvitz.

634
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:09,877
Hey, fellas!

635
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:15,633
I've been calling you
all fucking night long!

636
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:18,511
I was at my goomar's.
I told Silvio I was coming.

637
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:22,056
You answer me like
I'm Jesus Christ himself...

638
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:25,184
...if you lie, may your mother
die of cancer of the eyes.

639
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,648
- Where's Pussy?
- I don't know.

640
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:33,276
- Don't you fucking lie to me!
- Tony!

641
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:37,864
Did you do it?

642
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:40,199
- Tony.
- Shh.

643
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:42,243
Don't fucking lie to me.

644
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:47,165
- Did you do it?
- No.

645
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:49,459
- Did you fucking do it?
- No.

646
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:51,544
Did you fucking do it?

647
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:55,840
I said no! Now get your
fucking hands off of me.

648
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,675
Come on, Tony.

649
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,219
Come on.

650
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,823
I'm sorry, Paulie.

651
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:25,828
I can't find Pussy anywhere!

652
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:29,082
Nobody knows anything!

653
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:32,669
I haven't seen him since the schvitz.

654
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:38,049
The last thing he said to me was,
"Go fuck yourself!"

655
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:41,219
Did he at least take the schvitz?

656
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,642
He refused to take his clothes off.

657
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:54,732
The rat...

658
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:56,859
...it's fucking Jimmy!

659
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:05,368
Fuck it! Let's all have a drink!

660
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:16,838
All right.

661
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:19,090
Hey, babe!

662
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:24,220
Look what Chucky brought us!

663
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:28,516
Another kitchen appliance.
Whoop-fucking-pee!

664
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:31,018
Well, slit your wrists, why don't ya?

665
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:34,021
Truckload fell off
the loading dock at Zim's.

666
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:36,816
It's not even a Bra-oon.

667
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,485
That's a "Braun," babe.

668
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,029
Junior said for me to tell you...

669
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:44,657
...he's decided on that thing.

670
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:47,827
He said we should look out of town
for who's gonna do it.

671
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:49,495
- Finally.
- Yeah.

672
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,499
It's gonna be a busy month.

673
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,668
- I'll see you.
- See you later.

674
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:57,837
See you, Jo.

675
00:45:58,046 --> 00:45:59,672
Yeah, see you.

676
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:05,678
What was he talking about?

677
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:09,807
- Mind your business.
- Whatever it is, Mikey...

678
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:11,684
...we're going to Vegas.

679
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:15,521
I already lined up childcare,
so I don't want to hear it.

680
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:18,149
Forget it, something's come up.

681
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:21,944
Something always comes up.

682
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:24,280
This is a good something.

683
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:27,492
Hope it means more money
because I need a new car.

684
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:28,659
Trust me.

685
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:32,371
If this goes down, you'll
have a new car, and then some.

686
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:35,625
Can you tell me?

687
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:40,296
Oh, come on, Mikey! Tell me.

688
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:42,131
Come on, please?

689
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:47,887
I may be getting bumped up,
a notch or two!

690
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:52,725
Tony Soprano's on his way out,
and I mean as in "forever."

691
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:55,061
Oh, my God!

692
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:56,646
He's going to jail?

693
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:58,815
No, the other forever!

694
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,400
Does Junior know?

695
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:03,820
Oh, Jesus!

696
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:07,573
Listen, if you breathe
a word of this to anybody...

697
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:11,619
...they'll bury me and you right
next to Tony Soprano, understand?

698
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:13,538
- Yeah.
- Okay.

699
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:15,498
Make it decaf.

700
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:23,005
You don't belittle a man
like Junior Soprano.

701
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:24,590
He's old-school.

702
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:27,802
You don't joke about cunt-lapping,
and you don't...

703
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:32,306
...spill your guts out to a shrink
about business that isn't yours!

704
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:34,433
Tony Soprano sees a shrink?

705
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:37,770
You fucking believe that?
To add insult to injury...

706
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:40,314
...he was planning a move
against Junior!

707
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:42,024
His own uncle?

708
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:47,113
Were you this stupid
when I married you?

709
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:48,865
Fuck you!

710
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:52,702
No, fuck you. What are you doing
standing there? Make the coffee!

711
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:55,955
Take it easy, take it easy.
It's brewing.
