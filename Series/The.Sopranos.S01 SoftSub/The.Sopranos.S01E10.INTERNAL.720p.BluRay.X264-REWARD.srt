1
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,563
Talk it through the opening.

2
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,066
A little left.
A little left on your end.

3
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,526
All right!

4
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,281
Open the door.

5
00:01:56,449 --> 00:02:00,786
Any hinky shit, you'll be refrying
beans with Pablo Escobar again.

6
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:08,127
This is all a message to your friends:
Stay away from Port Newark.

7
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:12,339
Don't even drive out to Jersey,
not even on Sundays.

8
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,590
I'll tell them.

9
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:17,970
They've been told. Twice.
Now I'll tell them.

10
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:21,557
Here!

11
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,269
Holy shit!

12
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:26,937
Bingo!

13
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,064
We can't fit it all!

14
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:32,151
Fucking crackheads
and their small bills.

15
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:40,242
This is a token of my appreciation,
for recommending Dr. Melfi.

16
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:42,953
She's a good shrink.
I'm not a model patient...

17
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,789
What? What? You didn't have to.

18
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:48,959
These are Montecristos.
These are Cuban.

19
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,961
Yeah, they're the best, right?

20
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,588
Aren't they illegal?

21
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:54,506
They're cigars.

22
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:59,303
- Oh, they're dreamy, Ton.
- You're a good neighbor, Bruce.

23
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:03,432
I'm a doctor. I make referrals
all the time. You don't have to...

24
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:07,102
- No biggie.
- I bet these were hard to come by.

25
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,770
They fell off a truck.

26
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,773
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

27
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,276
- Hello?
- It's done.

28
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,362
It's the biggest refrigerator
you've ever seen.

29
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:18,614
And the other thing?

30
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:22,451
Juan Valdez has been separated
from his donkey.

31
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:30,667
You know, Ton, I been watching you
out back with your putter.

32
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,794
- You ever play at the club?
- No.

33
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,464
I play Minnisink, the public course.

34
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:39,468
You ought to come to the club
and play sometime.

35
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:43,305
- No, you know, it's...
- Come on! It's a wicked back nine.

36
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,808
Besides, I think you'd like
some of the members very much.

37
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:49,061
Yeah, maybe, you know...

38
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:50,687
We'll see.

39
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,648
Here we go.

40
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:56,193
- Fresh champagne, gentlemen.
- Oh, that's beautiful!

41
00:03:56,486 --> 00:04:00,280
- I love a mixed salad.
- I could stare at it for hours.

42
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,866
A score like this happens
once in a lifetime.

43
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,327
Gotta make this work for us, legit.

44
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:08,497
Find a nice IPO, keep it spinning,
live off the juice.

45
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,083
- IP who?
- Tony!

46
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:12,376
Yeah, yeah?

47
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:16,672
IPO, Initial Public Offering, stock,
insider market trading shit.

48
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,174
- Where's my baby?
- Understand?

49
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:23,512
Paulie, baby. Get that big dick
in the Jacuzzi, now!

50
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,514
Ooh!

51
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,683
Taking off.

52
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:32,938
- Gonna celebrate, me and Adriana.
- Mother of mercy!

53
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,732
- Could this be the end of RICO?
- Maybe.

54
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,943
Just may be!

55
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,903
- Have fun!
- Say hello.

56
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,738
Say hello to your girl for me.

57
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:45,575
Thank you so much
for taking me to the theater.

58
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:50,080
Rent.
Fucking Broadway musicals.

59
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:55,377
We're supposed to be all weepy because
the heat's off in some guy's loft?

60
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,546
I'm humming the scenery, Chrissy!

61
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:01,258
Fifth row center
and dinner at Le Cirque!

62
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,553
I'm embarrassed to be hungry again.

63
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:06,805
Thank you.

64
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:10,058
After how many years with
Tony Soprano's crew...

65
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,561
...some shit has finally worked out.

66
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:16,898
Just when I was starting
to wonder if, you know...

67
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,694
Whose welfare check
you gotta cash to get a burger?

68
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:22,904
Hey, shut the fuck up!

69
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:26,450
Wouldn't it be cool to own
a restaurant like Le Cirque?

70
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,911
Madonna, with the careers.

71
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:33,165
The black guy over there,
he look familiar?

72
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,336
Why don't you just forget about
working and be with me?

73
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:38,503
Oh, yeah.

74
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:41,673
And be one of those wives
like Carmela Soprano:

75
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:46,970
Breast-feeding rug rats and spending
the rest of your life at the gym.

76
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:51,767
You're right. My cousin's always had
a brain, but what does she use it for?

77
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,978
With a husband who can't tell you
where the money's from.

78
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:58,982
- What am I back here, Mark Fuhrman?
- You're a dick, man!

79
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:00,692
Chris, would you chill?

80
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:03,153
It's fucking discrimination, already!

81
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:04,613
Hey!

82
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,784
About time. Excuse me.

83
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,672
Bold men make bold statements.

84
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:26,927
Why'd they send you? I'm looking
for a burger, not converted rice.

85
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,303
Madonna.

86
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,555
Your woman looks embarrassed.

87
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:38,105
Give me a couple of burger baskets.

88
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:45,362
He's only bold because he's semi-hooked
up with the Tony Soprano crew.

89
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:54,955
What's with the attitude? If it's not
the blacks, it's somebody else.

90
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:56,289
Whoa.

91
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,709
- Nice.
- Must be the homie with the blue hat.

92
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:00,919
Yo!

93
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,796
Donnie Brasco.

94
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,714
Yeah?

95
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:08,552
My name is Orange J.
I'm down with Massive Genius.

96
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,471
That's who it was.
The gangsta rapper.

97
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,557
I told you to shut up!

98
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:18,270
We're having a party at G's crib.
Englewood Cliffs. You interested?

99
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:23,358
And I get served with black-eyed peas
tomorrow? Yo, I know what time it is.

100
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:28,113
Massive's heard of the crew you with.
There's business to be done.

101
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,904
This is a beautiful, beautiful home.

102
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:13,283
Smaller than my Hamptons crib,
but that's bigger than Steven's.

103
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,952
It's Italian contractors obviously.

104
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,330
Look at all these gold records!

105
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:20,665
Whoa.

106
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,335
What do we have here?

107
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,092
You like that shit?

108
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,472
A little Christmas present to myself.

109
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,975
Isn't that a sight to behold?

110
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,606
I do so love a good firearm
in my hand.

111
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,493
You people are all right.

112
00:08:57,578 --> 00:09:00,622
Godfather,
I seen that movie 200 times.

113
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,792
Godfather II was
definitely the shit!

114
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,877
The third one...

115
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:10,298
...a lot of people didn't like it,
but I think it was just misunderstood.

116
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,804
So what business you want to discuss?

117
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,275
- Mr. Herman Rabkin.
- Hesh.

118
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:31,278
I don't know him personally,
but I know his history.

119
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:34,698
In the late '50s and '60s,
he owned F-Note Records.

120
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:38,118
Yeah, Hesh was in the music business.

121
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,953
Little situation here.

122
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:44,958
My mother's deceased distant cousin,
Little Jimmy Willis, '50s legend.

123
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,544
Two seminal hit records
was his legacy.

124
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:49,713
Drug tragedy.

125
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,798
- "Such a Fool."
- Oh, I love that!

126
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,384
They play it all the time
on oldies radio.

127
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,677
Old Herman?

128
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:59,764
He's just another white motherfucker
stealing royalties...

129
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,434
...from the black man
that made him the money.

130
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:07,522
Jimmy's mother, who I'm content to
call my aunt, is owed that money.

131
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:14,321
Hesh is the sweetest guy. But I know
his opinion on giving back Israel.

132
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,407
I can only imagine what
he'll say about this shit.

133
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:22,287
Feel free to enjoy the food
and any other enjoyments.

134
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:29,169
- Champagne, sir. Ma'am?
- Yeah.

135
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,427
That guy's a gangsta?
I'm a gangsta.

136
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,556
I'm an OG, original gangsta.
Not him, fucking lawn jockey.

137
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,559
But he's got the fly Hamptons house.

138
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:49,105
Alec Baldwin comes over.
Whitney Houston. What do I got?

139
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:51,691
I sit in a fucking pork store,
for chrissake.

140
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:55,403
But the moolies, they got it
going on. And they're on TV.

141
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,405
They don't take no shit.

142
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:02,035
Soprano crew, it's always secret this,
omertá that. Gets on my nerves.

143
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:05,121
Junior with his moldy sweaters,
and he's a fucking boss.

144
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,125
You were just feeling
so good about yourself.

145
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:12,295
Our thing once ruled the music
business, did you know?

146
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:16,257
- No.
- We bankrolled acts, blacks, everybody.

147
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,511
Paid the DJs or busted heads
to get them played on the air.

148
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,596
There were great Italian singers.

149
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:26,768
Fucking A. Frankie Valli, Dion,
The Rascals, the whole Philly thing.

150
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:29,813
My dad used to talk about those guys.

151
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:33,191
Now? Fucking drum machine,
some ignorant poetry...

152
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:36,528
...and any dropout ditsoon
is chairman of the board.

153
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,239
Gangsta.

154
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:44,953
Talk about paesano pride. Go, Jovi!

155
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:09,561
- Oh, you're home.
- Hey.

156
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:14,190
- Barb Wagner called, you remember her?
- The mayonnaisers from up the street?

157
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,568
They invited us to a barbecue.

158
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:22,407
All right. Didn't think so.

159
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,746
Still with the brochures?

160
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:31,708
You believe how much it cost
for a college education?

161
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:33,877
We got enough.

162
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:37,797
I know we got enough,
but how much is enough?

163
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,216
God forbid, what if
something should happen?

164
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:44,512
Call up old man Coletti, tell him not
to put too much makeup on my face.

165
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:47,015
Don't joke around about this, Tony.

166
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,017
You'll be taken care of.

167
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:52,771
You always tell me that,
"I'll be taken care of." By who?

168
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:57,567
What is with the look?
Did you just make a score?

169
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:01,070
No. I wish.

170
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,824
You know, Tony, it's a
multiple-choice thing with you.

171
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:09,621
Because I can't tell if you're
old-fashioned, you're paranoid...

172
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,748
...or just a fucking asshole.

173
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,086
So what do I tell the Wagners?

174
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:18,713
Do you want to go?

175
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,006
Sure.

176
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:25,094
Even Cusamano asked me to play
a little golf with him at his club.

177
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:27,514
- Sorry.
- All right, all right.

178
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:38,316
Prick. New maître d',
he's really on the rag tonight.

179
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,693
I'll talk to him.

180
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:44,280
- Remember Richie Santini?
- Yeah, you used to fuck him.

181
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:49,077
That really sums it up. I knew him
since we were 3, he lived next door.

182
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:52,038
Yeah, we had our little phase.

183
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:55,208
- What about him?
- You've heard his band?

184
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:59,045
Defiler? I'm not into
that headbanging shit.

185
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:03,550
You talked about the good old days:
Italians running the music business.

186
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:07,720
Richie's this musician who you know.
They're not a hair band anymore.

187
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,013
And they're good!

188
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:13,309
You said yourself how much money
there was in this thing.

189
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,896
You mean, like, Richie Santini?

190
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,317
Would Massive Genius be interested?

191
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,529
It's a whole different thing. Black.

192
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:29,951
But he's got Massive G Productions.
Shit, they make movies even!

193
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:37,417
Massive does owe me a favor.
I'm arranging a sit-down with Hesh.

194
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:42,630
I was thinking about... Okay, okay,
I know this sounds kind of funny.

195
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,799
Music management.

196
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:48,803
I have met people, important people...

197
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:54,142
...learned people skills, how to deal
with big egos, solve problems.

198
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:57,604
And with my love of
all kinds of music...

199
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:02,525
Maybe Alec Baldwin would
come to our house.

200
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,763
It's an old demo.

201
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,389
No, you know what?

202
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,683
Fuck it.

203
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,810
Let's set you up.

204
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,521
- What?
- I got money.

205
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:44,025
With how much you listen to
the radio, you'd be good.

206
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,653
I can't believe it.

207
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,030
But I get to pick what you wear.

208
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:52,825
Dress you up. I like that.

209
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,093
This place has the flavor.

210
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:13,012
That gelding, name is Sydney.

211
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,224
You never wrote a song about him?

212
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:21,604
When you and Little Jimmy were
writing all his hits...

213
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:25,566
...did you write the music
and him the lyrics or vice versa?

214
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,611
We had our own process.

215
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:32,782
So that "Ooh, wacka-doo,
wacka-dooly do, I'm so blue..."

216
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:36,077
That spring from your experience
or the little brother's?

217
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:38,413
One could write a song about a horse.

218
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:41,165
But to be a hit with your audience...

219
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:45,128
...you'd have a cop on him, be ripped
up the ass with a Mac 10, no?

220
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:49,090
So you bought horses
with your royalties.

221
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,718
What about Little Jimmy's royalties?

222
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,803
He bought horse.

223
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:59,225
Music business back then, we broke
all the rules as we went along.

224
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,436
You mean raping and pillaging.

225
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:03,730
Things haven't changed much, huh?

226
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:07,942
Were we hard-nosed? Yeah.
But we gave a lot of kids their start.

227
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,945
A lot of Negro youth.
Took them out of the ghetto.

228
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,613
Put them on the stage.

229
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:17,952
Ordinarily I'd be more than happy
to stroll down Memory Lane with you...

230
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,288
...but I want reparations.

231
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:23,291
Why don't we call this what it is?
A shakedown.

232
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,461
Your father was a silent partner
in F-Note Records.

233
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:30,048
Made sure that the records
got airplay, right?

234
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:32,800
That money bought my house
at the Jersey Shore.

235
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:35,803
What are you gonna do?
I'm guided by you.

236
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:38,389
He's gotta do the right thing,
that's what.

237
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:43,227
You're way out of line, kid. Let's
get some cold water on your head.

238
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:51,819
Thank you, Jen.
Let's get right to the point, huh?

239
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,237
What's in this for you?

240
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,615
If you read Chuck D's book...

241
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:58,201
...he advises that
reparations be made...

242
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:01,329
...by the Jewish studio moguls
in Hollywood.

243
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:04,332
For the way black folks
were portrayed on film.

244
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,502
It's germane
to this argument in that...

245
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:11,214
...the grievances in the music
business are far worse.

246
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:14,342
You're talking to
the wrong white man, my friend.

247
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:18,846
My people were the white man's nigger
when yours were still chasing zebras.

248
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,309
As far as Louis B. Mayer is concerned,
what are you, nuts?

249
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,980
My lawyers have done research.

250
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:33,820
I think that the final figure
is somewhere around $400,000.

251
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:40,701
Now, a cashier's check made
to a Mrs. Idella Willis...

252
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,411
...will set it straight.

253
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:43,579
Or what?

254
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,129
What was it that she called him?

255
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,005
Oh, yeah.

256
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:57,552
"That nice man," I think she said.

257
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:09,772
So how's your neighbor?
The one with no neck?

258
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,440
The Sopranos?

259
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:15,611
There's a new car in the driveway
every other week. Besides that...

260
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,823
He gave me a gift of
some excellent Cuban cigars.

261
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,074
And you accepted them.

262
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:23,411
See? Eroding the neighborhood values.

263
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:27,790
He was thanking me for the physician,
which he is very happy with.

264
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Really?

265
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:34,630
What does that do to property values?
Having a gangster living next door?

266
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:36,090
Are you kidding?

267
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:39,594
Safest block in the neighb.
Being a gangster, what's that mean?

268
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:44,182
The shit I see in the boardroom, I
don't know if I'd make a distinction.

269
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,726
Oh, will you, please?
It's not the same.

270
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:49,437
Bugging, bribes? I don't know.

271
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:53,608
I think the only thing separating
American business from the Mobs...

272
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:55,610
...is whacking somebody.

273
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,111
- Listen to you!
- What?

274
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:58,946
Whacking!

275
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:04,118
He hangs around with Tony Soprano and
it's "fucking this, fucking that."

276
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:10,166
We were there for that fundraiser.
I didn't see any guns anywhere.

277
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:13,753
But that bar with
the goombah Murano glass.

278
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,591
I like Murano glass.

279
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,805
Those Montecristos.

280
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:27,600
What do you say? After dinner?

281
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:08,015
It ain't your type
of music, but...

282
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:11,143
I like any kind of music
that turns shit green.

283
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:15,439
He's been through a lot.
It's deepened his writing.

284
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:18,150
As a metal band
they were great, but this...

285
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,404
...as far as I am concerned,
blows away Matchbox 20.

286
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,030
What do they call themselves?

287
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,535
Used to be Defiler. Then some
personnel changes, bass and drums.

288
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:30,538
But Richie and Vito are still
the core of the band.

289
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:32,707
Now they're called Visiting Day.

290
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,639
This is some loud shit!

291
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,198
That's Richie.

292
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:11,120
And that's Vito.

293
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,210
Fuck you!

294
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,588
Sit the fuck down, you mullethead!

295
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,888
This isn't the right place for them.

296
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:34,518
- Boo!
- You suck!

297
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,771
Without the right help from you...

298
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:40,733
...Visiting Day could end up
in the miscellaneous V section.

299
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,203
You interested?

300
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:55,539
Yes.

301
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:04,215
That scene where Pesci sticks
the guy's head in a vise...

302
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:07,760
...and then pops his eye out.
I thought I was gonna die!

303
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:14,850
I'll be right back, okay?

304
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,020
Excuse me.

305
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:19,647
- It's this way?
- Yes.

306
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,148
Thank you.

307
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:04,066
- I don't know.
- What?

308
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:08,654
Richie, the guy's 30,
still lives with his parents.

309
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,448
It's because of the accident.

310
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,867
Richie had third-degree burns
from trying...

311
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:15,744
...to grill that trout
with a downed power line.

312
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:19,874
But at the same time, being
electrocuted turned his life around.

313
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,669
Well, you did
some ace fucking selling.

314
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,045
You think?

315
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,423
Yeah, thing is though...

316
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:31,552
...music is not something
you can hold in your hands, you know?

317
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:36,557
Like football betting cards or coke.

318
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,434
It's art.

319
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:42,605
Berry Gordy, whatever,
he had to see it in the Supremes.

320
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:46,567
It's an instinct.
I see it in Richie.

321
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:49,487
Yeah, probably is.

322
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:52,865
I'm really fucking doing it!

323
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:55,326
And it's all thanks to you.

324
00:24:56,912 --> 00:25:01,207
I'm gonna make a demo CD like
Massive advised. And then, yeah!

325
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,751
My wife thinks I need
to meet new people.

326
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,587
- So?
- You're Italian, you understand.

327
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:10,424
We're brought up to think
the americani are fucking bores.

328
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:13,594
But the average white man's
no more boring...

329
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:17,973
...than the millionth conversation over
who should have won, Marciano or Ali.

330
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:21,435
Am I to understand that
you don't consider yourself white?

331
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:25,272
I don't mean white like Caucasian.
I mean a white man.

332
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,566
Like our friend Cusamano.

333
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:30,653
Now, he's Italian,
but he's americano.

334
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:35,282
What Dad called a "Wonder Bread Wop."
He eats his Sunday gravy out of a jar.

335
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:39,662
You seem to want to branch out.
What's stopping you?

336
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,622
The guys, you know.

337
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,669
What they'd think if I started
hanging out with the americani.

338
00:25:57,138 --> 00:26:00,849
I was in the neighborhood last night.
At the Cusamanos'.

339
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:05,437
Oh, yeah?

340
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:07,731
Dinner party.

341
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:13,988
You should have stopped by.
Live right next door.

342
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:26,083
You didn't hear any strange noises
last night in your neighborhood?

343
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,335
Noises?

344
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:31,463
Like someone screaming in pain?

345
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:34,174
No.

346
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:38,345
Probably a television set.

347
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,602
You saw my house?

348
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,574
Oh, this looks good.

349
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:04,413
That sausage, where'd you get it?
That place in Garfield?

350
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:08,375
- Honey? Where'd we get the sausage?
- That place in Garfield.

351
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:11,962
The only thing better than salsiccia
is a pair of tits.

352
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:14,465
It's a hell of a piece of meat.

353
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:17,676
Salsiccia is a kind of a phallic thing.

354
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:19,428
Whereas tits...

355
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:26,060
Jack, you're a stockbroker, right?

356
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:29,063
Any changes in the market coming?

357
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:32,066
- It's always changing.
- Keeps us coming back.

358
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:37,571
Rand, you hear from Ross on Dexplex?

359
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:39,865
No, but the buyout is going down.

360
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:42,826
Give me some warning.
I need to call the islands.

361
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,203
Dexplex?

362
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,922
It's a little company.
It's going public, maybe.

363
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:58,175
Come on. The sun is shining,
it's a beautiful day.

364
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:00,636
Let's not talk business for once.

365
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,096
American Biotics.

366
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:05,224
Barb, our stock guru.

367
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:08,268
She thinks American Biotics
may be a good investment.

368
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:12,106
They're close to a side-effect-free
anti-impotence drug.

369
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:13,899
You guys play the stock market?

370
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,276
Oh, we don't just play...

371
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:17,778
...we win.

372
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:19,358
That's take 62.

373
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:21,235
We ought to just bag it.

374
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:31,787
Okay, we're bagging it.

375
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:34,998
We should've bagged this
days ago when it was perfect.

376
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,584
I wish I had thought of that.

377
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:43,799
It's good. You know, not bad.

378
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:45,884
It's as good as we'll get.

379
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:49,096
Oh, it wasn't too bad.
It was kind of good!

380
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:54,685
What are you saying?
Is something wrong?

381
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:58,897
We're all trying our best here.
I just think we hit a brick wall.

382
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:00,774
Maybe some rest.

383
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,194
Hey, hey, fuck that!

384
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:06,405
I paid for three days' studio time.

385
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:10,117
It'll only cost me more
to pack it up and come back again.

386
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:13,620
We got through the instrumental
tracks with no problem.

387
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:15,581
I'm fucking beat.

388
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,624
What about we finish this shit?

389
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,085
Three days we've been slamming our
hams!

390
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:23,255
Kinko's gave me five days off.
No big deal.

391
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:27,342
Kinko's? Buddy, this is
costing me 300 bucks an hour!

392
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:28,802
Here, try this.

393
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:35,142
Dude, I don't do drugs anymore, okay?

394
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:39,146
Well, hats off. But for all
the excitement in these songs...

395
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:42,190
...maybe you should suck on
another downed power line.

396
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:43,483
Christopher!

397
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:48,030
That was our most introspective song.
It's not supposed to rock.

398
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,657
- It'll be our first single.
- No, second.

399
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:53,994
- "Sharon's Chair" will bust out.
- I like "Melt."

400
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:57,664
Come on. Go shoot the crank.
Let's wrap this up.

401
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:02,002
- What?
- You heard me. Spike up!

402
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:03,295
No fucking way.

403
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,839
I'm producing these sessions.

404
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:09,468
Go take the fucking drugs!
I'm not fucking around anymore!

405
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:11,470
Look, the problem, Christopher...

406
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,849
...is the bass and the drum tracks
were miked wrong from the beginning!

407
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:19,645
Hey, King of Rock,
you're out of your depth.

408
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:21,521
Let me tell you something.

409
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:25,108
Thank you,
but I've recorded in Denmark.

410
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:28,236
You want to know what the problem is?

411
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:31,698
Where are the fucking choruses?

412
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:34,868
All your songs, you got no choruses.

413
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:39,039
Your choruses are just another verse.
What happened to "She loves You"?

414
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,582
"She Loves You"?

415
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:43,001
Yeah, the song started
with the chorus.

416
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:46,463
There is structure.
That's how you build a song.

417
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:51,843
The Beatles. That's been 40 years now
and it makes me fucking sick!

418
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,679
What is he, nuts?

419
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:56,014
- Fuck this, man.
- Where you going?

420
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:59,851
I'm going to AA, you fucking jerk-off!

421
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,396
- Get back to work.
- Christopher!

422
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:04,606
- Okay.
- Come on, come on!

423
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:06,775
Big man, huh?

424
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,575
- Fuck!
- You all right?

425
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:21,999
What? What...
Get back in the booth!

426
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,212
So we take it from the top.

427
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:29,923
We'll use a ukulele.

428
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,800
I can't believe you!

429
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:34,094
5,000 shares.

430
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:37,014
Yes, American Biotics.

431
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,058
Yeah, can you place the order today?

432
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:44,730
Okay, great. I'll have the money
to you by tomorrow.

433
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:49,693
Okay. Thank you. Bye-bye.

434
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:57,200
- What, are you spying on people now?
- I live here.

435
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,494
You playing Wall Street now?

436
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:04,041
Women are better savers than men.
And we are nurturers.

437
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:07,127
What do you know about
the stock market?

438
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:11,631
I keep my ears open.
CNBC is a very interesting channel.

439
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:17,054
Your father, God bless him,
does very well.

440
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:21,433
But who knows? What if something
unforeseen should happen?

441
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:24,561
What if he gets hit by a truck?
I mean, then what?

442
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,980
- I got you kids to think about.
- I don't know.

443
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,774
When you get married, you will.

444
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:34,071
A woman has to keep her individuality.
This here is a life lesson.

445
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:40,577
Okay.

446
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:44,581
Let's go to Georgette Klinger's.
Massage, facial...

447
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:47,667
...jour de beauté. On me.

448
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,128
Sure.

449
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:57,135
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

450
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:59,429
- It's a lily.
- Now, that's a shot.

451
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,641
- "Ball runs like a frightened faun."
- W.C. Fields.

452
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:05,769
- That thing's still running!
- This is a nice place.

453
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,897
Didn't I tell you?
We ought to make you a member.

454
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,691
Tony, you ever play
that place in Orlando?

455
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:16,029
No, I never get down there.
Well, Disneyworld.

456
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,240
You know, Al's place.

457
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:20,492
Mount Plymouth?

458
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:22,702
- AI Capone built it.
- No shit?

459
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:28,041
- He was a golf fanatic, that's right.
- So you guys watch A&E.

460
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:34,047
Tony, let me ask you a question.
If I'm stepping on toes, tell me.

461
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:35,841
How real was The Godfather?

462
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:42,848
I mean, in your opinion.

463
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:46,268
- What do you mean, real?
- Authentic or not.

464
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,311
I don't know.

465
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:52,732
How would I know?
It was the '50s, right?

466
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:57,445
- No, it wasn't. It was 1972.
- No, the story took place in the '50s.

467
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:00,574
Did you really have to cut
your finger and take an oath?

468
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:11,334
Like gridlock on Times Square
today, isn't it?

469
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:14,421
Traffic in Manhattan's worsened
since "Don't block the box."

470
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:17,299
You got a lot of friends
in New York, Tony?

471
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,676
- Yeah.
- You ever go to Little Italy?

472
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,180
San Gennaro, the feast with the kids.

473
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:26,474
What do you think of
when you hear Mulberry Street?

474
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:28,810
- Umberto's.
- Hey! All right!

475
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:34,482
You ever see that picture of Galante
dead, with a cigar in his mouth?

476
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:38,904
- No.
- It was a fucking beautiful hit.

477
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:45,285
Sorry, Tony.
You probably knew the guy, huh?

478
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,704
How fucking old you think I am?

479
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:52,417
You don't have to answer this if you
don't want to, but I gotta know.

480
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:55,420
Did you ever meet John Gotti?

481
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:03,136
Yeah. I knew John.

482
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:04,721
Fuck!

483
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,849
What was he really like?

484
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:15,649
- Remember Bungalow Bar?
- The ice cream trucks?

485
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:19,486
Like Good Humor, except
the trucks had bungalow roofs on.

486
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:23,323
Was Gotti a silent partner in that?

487
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,867
I don't know nothing about that.

488
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,495
Just know that
when the company folded...

489
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:31,665
...and they were auctioning off
the last truck...

490
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:35,126
...the one with the peaked roofs,
you're right, Cuse.

491
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:41,258
When they were auctioning off
the last truck...

492
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:43,802
...and I wanted it as a souvenir...

493
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:47,222
...Gotti outbid me.

494
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:52,936
Gave me a ride home.

495
00:37:56,691 --> 00:38:00,860
You know, he rang that bell
the whole way home?

496
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:14,624
They're waving at us.

497
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:22,716
Meow.

498
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:30,682
Meow.

499
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,559
Oh, I love this part.

500
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:41,693
This is good.

501
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:53,413
Some good guitar. Listen to that.

502
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:57,334
They got it going on.

503
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,002
Yeah.

504
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:32,243
So?

505
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,704
Well, I think it's not good.

506
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,249
Want to be more specific?

507
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:40,668
There's good and not good.
This is not good.

508
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,129
Maybe it's not your era, no offense.

509
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:46,716
Music is music. Talent is talent.
I don't care who you are.

510
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:51,471
I've seen them all. I saw heavy metal
invented by Hendrix at the Cafe Wah.

511
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,224
Kid just came out of the Army.
I said to him...

512
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:57,936
..."I don't know if it's talent,
charisma, magic, but you got it."

513
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:01,314
These kids? They don't, sorry.

514
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:03,691
You're just pissed about the sit-down.

515
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:07,070
Get the fuck out of here
and stop wasting my time.

516
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:10,532
This Vito is a great fucking
guitar player, Hesh.

517
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,283
He's a great guitar player.

518
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:14,494
However, there's one constant
in music.

519
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:17,664
A hit is a hit and this is not a hit!

520
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:19,124
- Why?
- Christ!

521
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:23,044
For reasons we couldn't comprehend
or codify, you pathetic schlepper!

522
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:27,507
Fucking Massive is a genius,
so what the fuck was he talking about?

523
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:30,093
When I was a kid, there was this guy.

524
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:31,803
We called him Jimmy Smash.

525
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:34,180
Now, he wasn't retarded.

526
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:39,394
But we thought he was because he had
one of these whatchamacallits:

527
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:42,814
"Hey, Jimmy, how the fuck are you?"

528
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:45,692
- What do you call that?
- Cleft palate.

529
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:46,943
Yeah.

530
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:53,825
Well, we was kids, right?
So what the hell did we know?

531
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,662
Every time he opened his mouth,
we'd piss ourselves laughing.

532
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:03,418
But Jimmy didn't mind because he got
to hang out with us, the popular crew.

533
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:05,670
We called him when bored.

534
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:09,924
Call him and say,
"Hey, Jimmy, sing 'Mack the Knife."'

535
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:13,636
Because he wanted to hang out
with us, he'd belt it right out.

536
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:18,099
We'd fucking roll
on the floor, laughing.

537
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:26,608
And then, you know, when the laughs
got old, we stopped calling him.

538
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:30,153
Wasn't until years later...

539
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:33,239
...I found out the poor prick
went home every night...

540
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,450
...and cried himself to sleep.

541
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,790
Then when I found out, you know...

542
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,918
...I felt bad.

543
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:51,799
But I never really understood
what he felt.

544
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,302
To be used, you know...

545
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:58,431
...for somebody else's amusement
like a fucking dancing bear.

546
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:01,643
Till I played golf with those guys.

547
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,940
You thought Cusamano was your friend.

548
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,485
You live, you learn.

549
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:17,492
Can I ask you a question?

550
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:21,621
Whatever happened to Jimmy?

551
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:25,750
Jimmy Smash?
He's doing 20 for robbery.

552
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:28,253
The cops knew who it was.

553
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:32,340
He goes to the bank in a mask
and goes, "Give me all your money!"

554
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:44,852
Some fucker's on the phone for you.

555
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:53,319
- Good morning, Herman. I'm listening.
- Good.

556
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:56,656
Don't miss what I have to say.
I've been thinking about it.

557
00:42:56,949 --> 00:43:00,702
- Go on.
- Find another schmuck to screw with.

558
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,495
You do know what this means?

559
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:05,665
Stupid enough to say it over
the phone. Let's hear it.

560
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:08,167
I don't threaten, Herman. I act.

561
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:13,298
Genius, you're in way over your head.
Why don't you back up a bit?

562
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:15,883
You know, let sleeping dogs lie.

563
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:17,844
Hey, Soprano.

564
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:20,471
This is what I think about
this gangsta rap shit:

565
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:23,891
You probably got a degree in
sociology from a city college.

566
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:27,270
I grew up in the projects. Delta 13.

567
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:29,355
Killed a man.

568
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:33,735
Later on I got a degree,
but urban planning.

569
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:35,695
You were close.

570
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:38,156
Now, when it comes to
"Which is mightier...

571
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:41,451
...the pen or
the motherfucking sword?"...

572
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,286
...I let the situation dictate.

573
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:44,662
Don't press it.

574
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:49,250
I'm gonna do my part to keep
Mr. Rabkin's people working.

575
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:50,543
What's that mean?

576
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:53,921
Expect to hear from
Goldstein, Baum and Woronov.

577
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:56,424
They represent us in the lawsuit.

578
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:58,051
You gonna sue?

579
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:00,678
With what I pay in retainers?
Fuck, yeah!

580
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:01,888
I hear that.

581
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:04,599
- Yeah, well...
- Listen, tatteleh.

582
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:09,395
Be advised that on your last single,
you sampled the backing vocal...

583
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:13,232
...from the Chablis' 1968 song,
"Riff Wit It."

584
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,569
For which F-Note Records controls
the recording rights.

585
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,030
- No shit.
- Yes, shit.

586
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:21,908
I would, of course,
have to countersue.

587
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:24,327
I'll see you in court.

588
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:27,580
Fucking legal fees.

589
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:32,669
What kind of melanzane are these?
They call themselves gangsters.

590
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,088
It's a new fucking day.

591
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,674
Fucking depressing.

592
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:40,885
Now, this is a Donatella Versace.

593
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:42,261
Nice.

594
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:44,764
You like it better than the Alaia?

595
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:53,898
- Keep them both.
- Christopher, $2400!

596
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:59,821
- I don't think you really like it.
- I like it. I like it.

597
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:11,082
MTV Awards?

598
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:16,421
What?

599
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:19,006
Nothing.

600
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:21,843
I thought that fight was over.

601
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:24,512
You want me to take it back?
No problem.

602
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:27,098
No! Fuck, I want you to have it.

603
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:46,409
You know how I use
positive visualization?

604
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:50,872
I know you talk about it. You're
fairly negative a lot of the time.

605
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:53,207
You should mentally prepare...

606
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:56,919
...for the fucking possibility
that Visiting Day sucks.

607
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:00,673
What?

608
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:05,553
You've gotten this far with Massive
because he wants to be in your pants.

609
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:09,015
Boy, oh, boy.

610
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:14,103
I let some experts listen to
the demo. They shit all over it.

611
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:18,483
Experts? Who? Hesh?
That old fucking synagogue cantor?

612
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:20,902
Silvio, he owned rock clubs in Asbury.

613
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:24,155
You heard what Squid said.
He's a professional engineer.

614
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:29,035
What about my opinion?
That it's good, that it's special?!

615
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:40,046
His eyes are on your ass 98%
of the time. You know that.

616
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,633
You're just trying to keep me down!

617
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:45,176
That ain't fair!

618
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:46,761
I don't want these clothes.

619
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:55,603
What's wrong with it?
What's wrong with Visiting Day?

620
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:57,021
I don't know.

621
00:46:57,731 --> 00:47:01,400
It's a problem that you don't know.
Richie, he'll sing anything.

622
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:06,572
You just don't believe my relationship
with Massive isn't based on fucking!

623
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:09,450
It's based on intelligence.

624
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,452
Respect. Talent!

625
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,079
I'll shut up.

626
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:19,752
You saying I don't have talent?

627
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:28,135
I branched out, made new friends,
new horizons and you can't stand that!

628
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:34,267
Yeah, go silent. That's you:

629
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:36,936
Either screaming your head off
or fucking dead.

630
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:41,774
I don't think I can stay here anymore.

631
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:51,868
- I love you.
- That is such a lie!

632
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:03,462
- Hey, Carmela!
- In here!

633
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:11,429
I need a finger.

634
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:16,058
- What's in the box?
- Sand.

635
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:17,852
I'm fucking with Cusamano.

636
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:19,353
Tony!

637
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:21,355
Beautiful!

638
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,733
You're cute when you're a bad boy.

639
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:26,068
You're awfully chipper today.

640
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:29,488
- So what are you doing with the box?
- Give it to him.

641
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:34,535
- Tell him to hold onto it for a while.
- Oh, Tony, that is so evil!

642
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:37,246
Yeah, I know.
That's why it's so much fun.

643
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:40,124
Oh, God.

644
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:02,855
Cuse! Cuse! Cuse!

645
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:04,482
Come here.

646
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:09,278
- Hey, Ton. How you doing?
- Good, how you doing?

647
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:12,573
Fine, thanks. Listen...

648
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:15,201
...you know, that nickname...

649
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:17,161
What? Cuse? Cusamano!

650
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:20,831
- It's got that other connotation...
- No, no, not anymore.

651
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:25,211
I need a little solid. I need you
to hang onto this for a while for me.

652
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:30,091
Hang onto it and I'll come get it
when I need it.

653
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:31,884
How long?

654
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:35,304
A month. Maybe more, maybe less.

655
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:38,224
- Okay? Thanks.
- Yeah, sure.

656
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:42,395
I meant to ask you about the club.
What's going on?

657
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:44,271
Oh, the club.

658
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:49,276
I'm sorry, Ton.
Membership's closed.

659
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:52,321
- Closed?
- Yeah.

660
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:57,243
- No new members until old members die.
- Nobody's dying?

661
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:01,414
- Nothing we could do anything about.
- No biggie, Cuse.

662
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:02,957
- You sure?
- Thanks.

663
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:06,502
- I mean, because...
- No. I'll live.

664
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:14,111
Now, that's a hit.

665
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,875
What is it? Heroin?

666
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:32,254
Shit, Jean, I don't know.
A weapon? I don't know.

667
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:35,341
Could be anything.

668
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:40,137
Don't touch it.
