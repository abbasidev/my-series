1
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,703
You gonna say something, or what?

2
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,206
It's your dime.

3
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,212
What's he doing here?

4
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:13,882
A friend of mine walked by.

5
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,718
Heshie. He has a 3:00.

6
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:39,867
Yeah, baby.

7
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,762
- What the hell's going on?
- Thunderstorms.

8
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,684
- Jackie.
- You smell it?

9
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:07,936
That's rain.

10
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,566
Dr. Melfi, what the hell
are you doing to me?

11
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,036
Go back to sleep.

12
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,391
What are you doing up?
You got school tomorrow.

13
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,518
Working on a high score.

14
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,313
- Did your mother go to bed?
- Yeah.

15
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:52,814
Where were you?

16
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,276
The compactor went down
at Barone Sanitation.

17
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,490
Move over.

18
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:06,787
- Ready?
- Yeah.

19
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,163
Go!

20
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:11,083
Watch out for the ghosts.

21
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:15,796
This ain't steering right.

22
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:17,673
Yeah, kicking your butt.

23
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,592
So how're things going with you?

24
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,012
How's school?

25
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:34,439
Dad, you have to concentrate.
New game.

26
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,447
- No fair.
- It's called a handicap.

27
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:44,908
Come on, stop!

28
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,201
I'm kicking your ass!

29
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,620
- One hand, look at that!
- I can't see.

30
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,709
Get off!

31
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,044
Ow! Stop! Come on!

32
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,508
You lose.

33
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,554
Focus through distractions.
There's your lesson.

34
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,723
I want you in bed in 10 minutes.

35
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,727
Andretti, you listening to me?

36
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,272
Good night, Dad.

37
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:16,690
Good night.

38
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:21,903
Where'd you park?

39
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,406
In the parking lot.

40
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:28,410
- No one followed me.
- Adriana, you wouldn't know it.

41
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:31,413
Oh, yeah. Like Tony Soprano's
hiding in my back seat.

42
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,916
- You are so paranoid.
- Bring the car right here.

43
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:39,254
I know, he's in disguise.
That could be him.

44
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:43,091
Hey, Tony! Or maybe he's
in the trash can.

45
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:45,677
Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

46
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,638
Ow! Let go of me!

47
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:53,101
It could be anybody, anytime.
I don't even know if it's Tony.

48
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:55,437
You gave crystal meth
to his daughter!

49
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:57,439
Which I'm not sure he knows.

50
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:59,524
Look at my wrist. It's all red.

51
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:00,776
I'm sorry!

52
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:04,613
But I got dragged out to
the fucking Meadowlands by my neck!

53
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,907
Mock execution!

54
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,200
What?

55
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,953
- What?
- Nothing.

56
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,706
- No, what?
- You don't want to know, trust me.

57
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,541
Know what?

58
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:20,379
I heard the nurse say you made
number two in your pants.

59
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:21,546
Is that what happens?

60
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:25,217
Get the car! Please, can we
just go to Brendan's...

61
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:28,595
...score some shit and find out
what's going on?

62
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:29,971
Please!

63
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:37,979
Brendan, let's go. Wake up, man.

64
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,318
The fool leaves his door open.

65
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,320
- I gotta pee.
- Go for it.

66
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:48,448
You should have seen me at the
hospital. Three nurses...

67
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,496
You will comply with the orders.

68
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:18,353
Yeah. Yeah.

69
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,356
That's the message. Thanks.

70
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,692
Way to go, Anth!

71
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:27,946
Hear it in five, four, three, two...

72
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,408
Yo, check it.

73
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:44,880
You think this is funny?

74
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,715
What? What's funny?

75
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,008
I didn't do nothing.

76
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,385
You beep me again, you'll be sorry.

77
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,846
We don't know what
you're talking about.

78
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:56,516
"Your mother blows."
That's a real original message.

79
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,810
- Maybe she does, right?
- Yeah.

80
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:02,189
Then why'd you eat all the
doughnuts she sent us at camp?

81
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,401
And then cry on her shoulder:
"I'm so homesick, Mrs. Piocosta."

82
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,153
Why don't you shut up?

83
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:11,239
Have another doughnut,
you fat fart-knocker!

84
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:17,370
I'm gonna kill him!

85
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,667
Dickwad!

86
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,920
Hey, break it up!

87
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,297
Break it up!

88
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,259
I want a 5-minute
cool-down period, now.

89
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,185
See you next week, doc.

90
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:41,937
Mr. Dante, you forgot something.

91
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,730
Thank you, baby.

92
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,108
- Don't forget to floss.
- You saved my life.

93
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,611
All right. See you next week,
all right?

94
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,450
Can I help you, sir?

95
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,577
Sir?

96
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,412
Sir?

97
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,104
Oh, my God.

98
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:28,441
- I'm having second thoughts.
- About?

99
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,319
This whole thing,
this whole arrangement.

100
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,031
Security.

101
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:38,994
I come here, I tell you things,
I don't know how safe it is.

102
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,454
I understand your concerns.

103
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,707
But I told you what
the ground rules are:

104
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,001
As long as I don't hear anything
incriminating...

105
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:49,504
You don't fucking get it.
Just my being here incriminates me!

106
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:53,675
Somebody sees me, they tell somebody
else, all of a sudden I'm a celebrity!

107
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:57,012
I thought we made some progress
on your narcissism.

108
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,889
Who are you?

109
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:04,519
Why is that so important
for you to know?

110
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:08,857
My mother told me never to
answer a question with a question.

111
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:13,069
So your mother did
teach you something.

112
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:17,490
If I asked you about your life,
who you talk to, who you trust?

113
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,368
I'd have to take the Fifth.

114
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,080
That's cute.

115
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:26,875
Oh!

116
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:32,505
I'm sorry, I wasn't aware of
what I was saying.

117
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,133
I'm sorry.

118
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,227
- Why are you here?
- Chris sent me for you.

119
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,314
Chris? Did something happen?
Must be my dad, right?

120
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,232
Why else would Chris send you?

121
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,526
Did Brendan get my poem?

122
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:58,114
Another search warrant? Calls them the
Federal Bureau of Annoying Bullshit.

123
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,658
You told your old man!

124
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,202
You scared me!
What happened to you?

125
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:06,373
We're moving to Florida because you
couldn't keep your mouth shut!

126
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:07,666
What are you talking about?

127
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,501
Did Brendan ask about me?

128
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,920
Get us out of here! Get us out!

129
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,966
- Did you tell your old man?
- About the meth? Are you insane?

130
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,094
Don't you get it? This is serious!

131
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,388
Let go of me!

132
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:23,723
Stop this shit!

133
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:27,227
He's worried about you. He's been
asking about you, asshole.

134
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,022
I'm sorry if I hurt you.

135
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:33,817
I hate my life, being a Soprano.

136
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:34,984
Hey...

137
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,321
...don't ever say you hate life.
That's blasphemy.

138
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,073
Fuck you!

139
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,075
Okay, let's go.

140
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,119
Remember when you were little?

141
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:46,705
I'll buy you one of those
Happy Meals, all right?

142
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,832
Where the fuck are you?

143
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:07,308
This is a new shirt your grandmother
bought. It's in the trash?

144
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,311
It's a Westport.
It's not even cool anymore.

145
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:12,313
What did you just say?

146
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,482
I got in a fight.

147
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:18,361
Hope you did as much damage
to his wardrobe. Who with?

148
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,656
I didn't get caught. No demerits.

149
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,324
Anthony, who?

150
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,660
Jeremy.

151
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,704
Jeremy Piocosta?

152
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,832
You were together at camp.
I thought you were friends.

153
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:35,837
If that's all the information I get,
I'll call Mrs. Piocosta.

154
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,672
No, Ma, wait! Don't call!

155
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,675
You kids are gonna learn
the value of a dollar!

156
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,636
- I'll wash your car.
- You never put any effort in.

157
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:46,139
I will, I promise.
I'll do it really good.

158
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,641
Just don't call, I'll get the money.

159
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,518
Forty dollars, Anthony.

160
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,729
I know, I know.

161
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:01,946
Ma!

162
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,782
How you doing?

163
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,658
What brings you here?

164
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,787
Remember that pastry place?
Ferrara's?

165
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,247
Brought you some macaroons.

166
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,627
They're too sweet!

167
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,588
What do you mean?
They're your favorites!

168
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:26,262
The activities director,
Rosie, says...

169
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,516
...they're organizing a trip
to the city.

170
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,476
Dinner and a show.

171
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,646
And you don't want to go.

172
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:38,691
- I don't like the people here.
- You don't know them.

173
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,486
And that city.

174
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,696
Grown men soiling themselves.

175
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,866
- It's not like that anymore.
- That Giuliani...

176
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,910
Let's stick to the field trip.

177
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:52,872
Mothers throwing their babies out of
skyscraper windows.

178
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:56,000
You're always with the babies
out the windows.

179
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:03,258
You don't mix with the other ladies
or talk to the nice gents I see around.

180
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:06,928
- You're not taking opportunities.
- What do you care?

181
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,764
Out of sight, out of mind.

182
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:11,975
We don't think like that.

183
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,435
Not me, or Carm, or the kids.

184
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,438
I wish the Lord would take me now.

185
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:24,362
I came to get cheered up.
Think that's a mistake?

186
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:27,240
You being sarcastic?

187
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,617
You can't put your problems on me.

188
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,829
This is the most expensive
retirement home in New Jersey.

189
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,206
If you wanted to, you
could be happy here.

190
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:36,916
You're pissing it all away.

191
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,836
What beautiful language
for your mother.

192
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:50,972
You want the macaroons?

193
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,099
I don't care.

194
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:04,569
Leave some out for the lunatics.

195
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,377
Goodbye, Ma.

196
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:29,093
They're saying it might rain today.

197
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,649
What the hell are you doing?

198
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,360
This place is an hour from my office.

199
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:49,447
Are you a woman? Get a bladder
transplant. My mother lives here.

200
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,407
It's not real convenient for me.

201
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:55,411
It's not convenient?
Why don't we meet at your precinct?

202
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:59,332
The government would love a few
pictures of us for the scrapbook.

203
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,167
What do you got for me?

204
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,338
Here.

205
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:10,176
- "Jennifer Melfi, M.D."?
- Her background, daily routine.

206
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,679
And your personal relationship
with her is?

207
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,347
None of your fucking business.

208
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,975
You can't blame a guy for trying.

209
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,726
Are you bored with your life?

210
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:22,063
Oh, yeah, sure!
Busting whores and junkies.

211
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:26,067
Plus, it's a thrill to pay two
alimonies on a $40,000-a-year income.

212
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,443
All right, listen.

213
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,612
I don't want her touched or bothered.

214
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:32,407
I want to know the who,
when, why. That's it.

215
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,242
Usual fee?

216
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,578
The Knicks lost, lieutenant.

217
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:39,872
You're down two large.

218
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:43,626
- Lay off the vig.
- We'll see what kind of job you do.

219
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:46,713
Okay. See you in a few days.
What you got in the box?

220
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,631
Macaroons.

221
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:58,599
This is awful.

222
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:01,019
I can't deal with this.

223
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,606
What kind of God?

224
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,986
Christopher!

225
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,362
Where you been?

226
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,450
- What happened to you?
- Brendan's dead.

227
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:16,868
What are you talking about?

228
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,037
The fish is in my pocket.

229
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,456
Brendan's brains are floating
in his bathtub.

230
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,416
Message job. Through the eye.

231
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,667
Moe Greene special.

232
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:27,837
- Uncle Junior.
- What do you mean, Moe Greene?

233
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,005
In one.

234
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:33,134
Moe's eyes got too big for his stomach,
so they put a caliber in his eye.

235
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:34,969
Mikey Palmice does their hits.

236
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,473
- In his glasses, you mean.
- Glasses, eyes. Why quibble?

237
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:41,225
I'm at the World Trade Center.

238
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:48,566
What are you doing?
Palmice's a made guy.

239
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,902
He didn't have the balls
to do it himself.

240
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,821
Contracted these Russians,
and he killed my friend.

241
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,784
Our response should suit the message.

242
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,162
In the mouth means he was a rat.

243
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:05,166
It's just how Francis framed
the shot, for the shock value.

244
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,835
Brendan didn't deserve it.
Don't talk me out of it.

245
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,837
Listen, you can't touch Mikey.

246
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:13,758
Your uncle's pissing on your head,
what do you expect me to do?

247
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:18,554
I'm on it, T. I know where Mikey's
house is, over by Route 10.

248
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:23,351
No. He tries to leave,
you break his other neck.

249
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:59,220
Hey, Mr. GQ. Got a ticket.

250
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:02,181
- How you doing, Mikey?
- How you doing?

251
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,564
Son of a...

252
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:13,568
Your suit's wrinkled. Here, let
me fix it up for you.

253
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,445
Why are you screaming?
Free alterations.

254
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:19,031
Missed a spot.

255
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,120
This is overdue.

256
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,257
Hear about the Chinese godfather?

257
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,218
He made them an offer
they couldn't understand.

258
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:42,263
We gonna stop before
it gets out of hand?

259
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:45,600
- Not even a hello?
- I'm here because I love you.

260
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,143
And I respect you.

261
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,562
Don't pretend you're
paying me respect.

262
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,898
A son who throws his mother
in an asylum.

263
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,858
She lives like a poveretta.

264
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,154
That's none of your business.

265
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:02,074
Your friends get in my business,
expect me to turn the cheek.

266
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,160
The truck was made good to you.

267
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:09,040
I'm sitting here like patience
on a monument, waiting for discipline.

268
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:11,792
Your boys were warned,
and still they embarrass me.

269
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:15,463
I run my crew my way.
What you did was extreme.

270
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,298
Now you're my judge?

271
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:20,134
I answer to bigger people
than you, my friend.

272
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:22,303
Like Jackie?

273
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,513
Want to take this to his deathbed?

274
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:30,645
That nephew of yours we gave
a high colonic...

275
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:32,521
...he earns good?

276
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,108
- He's coming up.
- Okay.

277
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,110
He works for me now.

278
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,447
Excuse me?

279
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:44,325
Maybe he gives you agita for a change.

280
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:49,664
You got some set of balls, you know that?
Absolutely not.

281
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:53,918
I show you my hand,
and you slap it away.

282
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:59,090
What's the matter with you?

283
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:02,551
Why can't we talk
like adults anymore, huh?

284
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,428
Out.

285
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,765
Next time you come in,
you come heavy or not at all.

286
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,979
You don't mean that.

287
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:40,881
By the time I get to take the sergeant
exam, the pay scale is frozen by law.

288
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,050
Why are we following these people?

289
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:46,595
They grabbed a meal, saw a movie.
So what?

290
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,931
Luckily they stopped at
that package store.

291
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:50,683
I got a juice.

292
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:53,519
Yeah, I can smell the potatoes.

293
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,313
Hey, listen, asshole.

294
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:59,608
Same make and model left the scene
of a homicide on Long Island.

295
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,152
Stay fucking current.

296
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,576
You broke it off
with the shlub after a week?

297
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,454
I know. I feel for you males.

298
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:15,249
It's our goddamned fault
you don't know how to act.

299
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:16,959
Admitting mistakes.

300
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,839
We tell you to be more sensitive,
you join Promise Keepers.

301
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:27,470
We say, "Get in touch with your
feelings." You run into the woods...

302
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:31,474
...gunking yourselves with bear fat,
beating a drum.

303
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,476
Don't ruin my evening.

304
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,311
- You know what I mean.
- Sure.

305
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:38,397
You want someone who's
sensitive to your needs...

306
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:42,026
...but still decisive enough for
a grope in the closet.

307
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,319
Yeah.

308
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,863
Something like that.

309
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,284
Oh, shit! That's all I need.

310
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,329
We were speeding?

311
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,331
I wasn't looking.

312
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,124
Pull over.

313
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:20,481
License and registration, please.

314
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:26,987
I'm sorry, officer.
Did I do something wrong?

315
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:29,407
Detective.

316
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:33,119
You crossed the double line,
have you been drinking?

317
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:35,037
We had wine with dinner.

318
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,914
Step out of the car, please.

319
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:38,999
I don't believe this.

320
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:43,129
Just relax, Randall,
and do what he says, okay?

321
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:50,219
I need you to walk a straight line
to me, sir. Heel to toe.

322
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,054
Look...

323
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,223
I applaud your vigilance.

324
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,600
But this is unnecessary, all right?

325
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,103
I'm a lawyer.
I know I'm under the limit.

326
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,147
- Open the trunk, please.
- What?

327
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:03,774
- You want to search my golf...?
- Open it!

328
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:05,151
I will not!

329
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,278
You ever hear of probable cause?

330
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:10,030
Oh, yeah, that's a real good legalese!

331
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,032
Are you resisting arrest?

332
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:13,868
Hey!

333
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,162
Vin, fucking cool it!

334
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,165
He can't do that!

335
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:22,251
- Back in the car!
- He didn't do anything wrong!

336
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,378
Back in the car, now!

337
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,714
Come on, let's go!

338
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:31,302
I perceived what I thought
was a weapon.

339
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:33,679
What the hell's wrong with you, Vin?

340
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:37,099
Take him. DUI, resisting arrest,
assaulting an officer.

341
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:39,518
- What's he...?
- Do it!

342
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,312
Jesus Christ!

343
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,525
Don't you touch me!

344
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:50,988
You got prime rib at home.
Don't be going out for hamburgers.

345
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:54,408
What? What are you talking about?

346
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,076
Randall!

347
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,329
Randall, I'll follow you!

348
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:02,041
I'm gonna call my lawyer,
you fuck, you!

349
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,252
She's seeing a Randall Curtin,
tax lawyer.

350
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,254
He lives at...

351
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:11,050
...1242 Rennsalaer Road.

352
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:13,761
He's divorced, got two kids.

353
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:16,472
He's the country club type.

354
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,391
Not much in the balls department,
I might add.

355
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:20,851
What about her?

356
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:24,396
The good doctor, in her
office at 8 a.m., leaves at 6.

357
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,565
Orders a tuna sub and Diet Coke.

358
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:31,153
She's got a three-bedroom condo
in Essex Fells. Shops at Pathmark.

359
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:33,989
She's divorced, one kid, 19.

360
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,450
Outside of schmucko,
she don't get out much.

361
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,410
But she does see a shrink.

362
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,454
She what?

363
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:44,875
Yeah, she sees a shrink, once a week.
His name is Elliot Kupferburg.

364
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:47,461
Fuck me!

365
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:50,631
She don't fuck anyone,
from what I can tell.

366
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,925
It's not because she don't
got the goods.

367
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:56,178
She left her blinds up, I got some of
them Victoria Secret-type snaps.

368
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,138
If you're interested.

369
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,848
A little a this?

370
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,643
- Good enough, then?
- Yeah.

371
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,353
You got any Advil?

372
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:06,355
What am I, a fucking pharmacy?

373
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:11,360
What you got on Friday's game?
I got three bills on Rutgers.

374
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,737
That'll solve all your problems.

375
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,665
Thank you.

376
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,002
With a stapler?!

377
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,255
I heard Mikey had to give up
that nice suit.

378
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:34,174
He got too attached to it.

379
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:39,513
Michael Palmice's been a disease since
he was 5, he had it coming.

380
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,599
It don't make things any easier.

381
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:45,019
- My uncle's stubborn.
- Stubborn enough to go to war?

382
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,192
What kind of a word is that?

383
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:55,112
There hasn't been a war
since the Columbo thing.

384
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:56,614
Everybody decided.

385
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:59,658
No one's going to the mattresses
these days.

386
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:03,537
I got a top-of-the-line Posturepedic
at my house. Fuck it.

387
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,958
If Jackie wasn't sick,
this wouldn't have happened.

388
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:09,376
You're right.

389
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:11,879
So one of us captains gotta step up.

390
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:14,006
Lack of control
is fucking up this family.

391
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:16,258
- That's true.
- You can say that again.

392
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:21,055
If the old man were here, instead
of in that cell in Springfield...

393
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:24,224
...he'd say, "Raymond,
this is your moment."

394
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,061
Go easy with the grease gun, okay?

395
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:31,899
You're the Boy Wonder. Him and Jackie
both had you picked from day one.

396
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,234
You got the age, the seniority.

397
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:37,571
I also got an 18-year-old
with MS, okay?

398
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:40,240
I told Nucci I'd be doing less,
not more.

399
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:44,578
All due respect to your crippled kid,
you don't want a wire up your ass.

400
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:47,748
That's why you should be boss,
you're so fucking smart.

401
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:51,210
And it's "physically challenged."

402
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:52,628
Absolutely.

403
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:56,757
Why don't we run it like a council?

404
00:27:57,008 --> 00:28:01,553
Larry, the old guys set this up
as a paramilitary organization.

405
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:05,391
We need a supreme commander,
not the fucking Dave Clark Five.

406
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:10,979
Face it, T. You and Junior
are gonna have to duke it out.

407
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,815
You've gotta be boss.

408
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,942
Number one, I'm not the man.

409
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:18,237
Number two,
he's got New York behind him.

410
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:20,948
Not for anything,
God bless your uncle...

411
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:24,201
...but he's living in the wrong
century. New York knows it.

412
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:29,081
You want it, T,
you'll get there okay.

413
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:32,543
It's the right thing.
It's inevitable.

414
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:35,087
I don't want no disturbance.

415
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,645
Hey, what's up?

416
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,397
Nothing.

417
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,650
Bet you told your mom what happened.

418
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,277
What are you, high?!

419
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:03,323
Well, you owe me $40 for the shirt.
The collar was ripped.

420
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,492
You still owe me for 4th of July.

421
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,453
Bottle rockets? I paid for them.

422
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:11,498
Not for the M-80s. Remember,
the ones we blew up the frogs with?

423
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:14,001
Oh, yeah. That was pretty cool.

424
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,586
Yeah.

425
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,630
Just give me the money.

426
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,591
That thing was gay!
I did you a favor.

427
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,134
You're gonna do it!

428
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:24,261
Make me, fatty!

429
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:27,264
- Dickwad!
- Asshole!

430
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,141
Whoa!

431
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,062
Shithead!

432
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:37,191
Bitch! Come on.

433
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,068
Let's go, shithead!

434
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:43,071
- Let me go!
- So I can kick your ass again?

435
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,032
I was kicking your ass!

436
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,533
Nobody won, it was a draw.

437
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:49,870
The Pit, tomorrow, 3:00.

438
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:54,875
Help me with the chinch bugs,
they're killing my corn.

439
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,045
This stuff works pretty well.
It's safe for the environment.

440
00:29:58,254 --> 00:29:59,713
I tried that.

441
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:02,674
You got any DDT back there?

442
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:05,010
That stuff's illegal,
it's been banned.

443
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,554
Maybe you have a little surplus
back there.

444
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:09,181
I'll meet you back there.

445
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,099
If I could help, I would...

446
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:15,062
Mr. Piocosta! Right?
How you doing?

447
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:21,109
You remember, our boys
went to Camp Aheka together?

448
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,403
- Of course, Tony. How are you?
- Good.

449
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:26,114
Your kid still got that killer
crossover dribble?

450
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,825
Yeah, I guess so.

451
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:29,576
That'll get him a scholarship.

452
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,036
So how's Anthony?

453
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:35,123
He's moody, you know.
For a kid that age, you know.

454
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:37,876
Nice seeing you, Tony.

455
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:41,129
Why don't we get together
and cook dogs for the boys?

456
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:46,552
Tony, I don't even know if
these guys are close anymore.

457
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,554
Did Anthony say anything?

458
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,056
I'll have Carmela call Joanie.

459
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:53,517
Linda.

460
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:58,438
That's great. Tony, that's great.
I'll see you around.

461
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:36,310
- Tony!
- Yeah?

462
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:39,479
Oh, my God! Tony!

463
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:47,821
I thought the medication was supposed
to help your panic attacks.

464
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:53,243
It does.
It's the first one in a while.

465
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:58,040
What does your therapist say?
He should increase your dosage.

466
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:03,378
He's got more degrees than a
thermometer. Don't worry about it.

467
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:09,426
Does your therapist ask questions
about our marriage?

468
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:13,013
I know personal feelings
are hard for you to talk about.

469
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,265
That's all we do is talk.

470
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,645
Carm, I'm gonna quit.

471
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:25,275
- Did you bring this up with him?
- Yeah. He knows.

472
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,361
I guess.

473
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:33,659
I forgot to take my Prozac
this morning.

474
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:36,620
It's up in the bathroom,
can you get it?

475
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:43,043
I know with Jackie sick,
you're under tremendous pressure.

476
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:47,589
But I feel if the therapy didn't hurt,
it wouldn't be helping!

477
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:52,260
- You don't understand.
- That's why you're in therapy.

478
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,680
Because I don't understand!

479
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:59,267
I'm telling you, if you give up now,
I'll have to re-evaluate things.

480
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:01,645
What is that, huh?

481
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,482
I got a sensitive job,
I'm not an average Joe on the block.

482
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:07,359
It's our marriage, Tony!

483
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:09,611
Therapy is too much exposure!

484
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:12,698
Fine!
You live with the results then.

485
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:15,742
What's that, a threat?

486
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:20,831
No, Tony, it's a rave review.
Get your own fucking pills.

487
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,422
How long did the attack last?

488
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:30,841
About 30 seconds.

489
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:36,430
I was dizzy, out of breath.
That's it, I never lost consciousness.

490
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:37,931
Anything since?

491
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:45,063
I'll write you a scrip for Xanax,
just for a couple of days.

492
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:48,775
It'll get you over
the short-term stresses.

493
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:55,699
My uncle's got me in a box where I
gotta do something I don't want to do.

494
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:02,789
Then there's my mother.

495
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:07,419
Four grand a month and she acts like
I'm an Eskimo, pushing her out to sea.

496
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:13,759
She's testing.

497
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:16,970
Same as your uncle.

498
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,140
Like little kids.

499
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,310
There's a good book about this.

500
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:25,645
No, I read, I go right out.

501
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:29,816
It's Strategies for Coping
with Elder Family.

502
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:33,987
You can't fucking spank them.

503
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:38,158
Would it hurt to let your mother
think she's still in charge?

504
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:41,119
You have children,
you know what they're like.

505
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:46,500
Sometimes it's important to let them
have the illusion of being in control.

506
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:00,013
Chris, my man!

507
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:01,431
Surprised to see me?

508
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:04,976
Heard they took you for a ride.
Tour of the Meadowlands.

509
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,647
Heard you had a little b.m.

510
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,441
- You got my cut?
- They came and took it.

511
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:14,152
- Who?
- Junior Soprano's boys.

512
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,613
They said it's their corner now.

513
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,198
You let them?

514
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,700
I don't argue well
sucking on a Smith & Wesson.

515
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,161
- You didn't beep me?
- Word on the street...

516
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:26,832
...you out of commission.
Sorry, man, business.

517
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:33,088
You know, there's no one I'd rather
give my 10 points to than you.

518
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:37,175
It's all right. It's not your fault.

519
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:39,594
I'm glad to hear you say that, man.

520
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:41,721
Sneaky motherfucker.

521
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,100
Shit!

522
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:52,274
I don't care if they shove
a scud missile up your ass.

523
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:56,903
It's my corner. Pay anyone but me,
I'm coming back for your thumbs!

524
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:59,906
And that didn't happen, what you said!

525
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:07,581
I'm gonna kill you!

526
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:14,588
Good luck, A.J.

527
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:17,591
If you get in trouble,
go for the takedown.

528
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,136
Sweep kick and steamroll,
the game is over.

529
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,263
All you're doing is making me nervous.

530
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:26,391
- Want a Nitro bar?
- Would you shut the fuck up?

531
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,937
- He's coming!
- It's the moment of truth.

532
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:07,265
- Here.
- What the hell is that?

533
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,351
Just take it.

534
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,811
I'll fight you for it.

535
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:13,605
I can't!

536
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,858
- What do you mean, can't?
- Just take it!

537
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:23,406
I knew you'd chicken out.

538
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:31,039
He chickened out, he's scared.

539
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,250
He's real scared of you.

540
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:35,293
What's that supposed to mean?

541
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,837
You won, man!
Yeah, Tonio, you won!

542
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:39,297
I'm leaving.

543
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:21,423
One of gangland's
youngest alleged leaders...

544
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:24,759
...died late this afternoon
at St. Isaac's Hospital.

545
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,928
Turn it off! Turn the music off!

546
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,222
- one of the state's
top Mafia figures...

547
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,766
...was first hospitalized last year.

548
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:37,230
Authorities called Aprile the acting
boss for 74-year-old "Eckley" DeMeo...

549
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:41,234
...currently serving a life sentence
in Springfield Penitentiary.

550
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,236
Authorities say he was made
acting boss...

551
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:46,281
...for the North Jersey Mafia
two years ago.

552
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,908
Aprile was 44 years old.

553
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:55,957
Damn it, I was just there.
He told me he wouldn't go today.

554
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:01,546
I'll never forget
where I was this day.

555
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:10,221
- Sorry, T.
- He was a good man.

556
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,394
Let's do a toast, give me a toast.

557
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:21,941
To a great man.
To a great leader.

558
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:24,444
A great friend.

559
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,323
To Jackie.

560
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:31,659
Buon'anima.

561
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,875
T!

562
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,754
- You hear what happened?
- Just now.

563
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:47,217
That's not all! I go to make a pickup
from Yo Yo Mendez...

564
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:50,011
...he says it ain't my corner anymore.
It's Junior's.

565
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:52,013
Christopher, this ain't the time.

566
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:53,473
They're moving in!

567
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:56,601
I say we go to Def Con 4.

568
00:39:58,437 --> 00:39:59,979
I gotta assess this, all right?

569
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,898
What are we, politicians?

570
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:04,109
Does this look like the Senate?

571
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,319
This is about respect of our thing!

572
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,488
Shut the fuck up!
It doesn't concern you!

573
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:13,159
I represent you, and I'm tired
of putting my tail between my legs!

574
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:15,328
This ain't negotiation time!

575
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:19,124
This is Scarface, final scene,
fucking bazookas under each arm.

576
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,000
"Say hello to my little friend!"

577
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:23,086
Always with the scenarios.

578
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:27,006
You don't do something,
I gotta question your leadership!

579
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:29,717
You ungrateful little fuck!

580
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:32,679
Where'd you get the balls
to question my leadership?

581
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,681
I'm just saying how it is!

582
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:37,851
I'll rip your fucking head off
and finish the job!

583
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,853
- You're the boss!
- That's right...

584
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:43,898
...I am. And you're lucky
a man I loved died today.

585
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,705
Here we go, war of '99.

586
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,206
We should go.

587
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:03,084
You do what you're told,
when you're told!

588
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,254
Adiós, Junior.

589
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,242
Uncle Junior...

590
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:38,828
...I need to talk to you.

591
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:46,419
I came in heavy, like you said,
but I don't want to use it.

592
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:06,147
Our friend Jackie has died.

593
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:09,651
I heard.

594
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:11,986
And we need a leader.

595
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,365
We do.

596
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,580
I don't want any confusion
or misunderstanding.

597
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:24,249
Yes.

598
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:29,921
Sopranos have been waiting a long time
to take the reins.

599
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:38,388
That's why I want it to be you,
Uncle Jun.

600
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,813
This is your decision?

601
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:48,481
It is.

602
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,650
You speak for the captains?

603
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,111
I can.

604
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:56,197
Come here.

605
00:42:57,491 --> 00:42:59,492
You crazy cetriolo.

606
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:01,452
You had me worried there.

607
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:04,080
You think I'm gonna mess
with a guy like you?

608
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:06,833
You been pumping iron?
Strong as a bull.

609
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,836
Call Parcells,
give this guy a tryout.

610
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:12,672
- Come here.
- Always the bullshitter.

611
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:15,091
Just one thing, one thing.

612
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:18,469
You know I can't be perceived
to lose face, right?

613
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:21,014
So...

614
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,684
...Bloomfield...

615
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,062
...and the Paving Union.

616
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:30,315
That's my asking price.

617
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,323
Congratulations.

618
00:43:41,368 --> 00:43:43,494
You know the rules.

619
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,001
I almost got in a fight today.

620
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:51,461
Fight?

621
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:53,713
With Jeremy Piocosta.

622
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:56,507
I take French with his brother,
he's such a poser.

623
00:43:56,884 --> 00:44:00,553
- Who won?
- No one. He backed out.

624
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:03,431
Phil Litto said,
"Yeah, he's real scared of you."

625
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,642
When I asked what that meant,
they all laughed.

626
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:08,478
- Duh.
- What do you mean?

627
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:11,606
Sometimes you're so naive.

628
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:13,900
What does Dad do for a living?

629
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,568
Waste management.

630
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:18,404
Do you know any other garbage men
who live like this?

631
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:19,906
Uncle Jackie.

632
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:23,201
Why do we call him "uncle"
when he's not related?

633
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:27,080
He's in Dad's other family.

634
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,250
Come here.

635
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:43,930
I'll print it out for you.

636
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:26,848
Hi!

637
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:28,641
Jennifer.

638
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,977
I tried calling.

639
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:34,480
Yeah, the phone's off the hook.
Come on in.

640
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:43,448
I guess we won't be going to dinner.

641
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:45,908
I'm worried, Jennifer.

642
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:52,039
I think I'm starting to lose it.

643
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:55,251
I was standing in line
in the doughnut shop.

644
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:57,211
A man in a booth looked at me.

645
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:00,673
All of a sudden,
I started shaking uncontrollably.

646
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:03,259
The lady says "next," I ran away.

647
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,597
Hey...

648
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:12,602
You've been through a very
traumatic experience.

649
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:16,355
I hate to admit this...

650
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:19,859
...but I'm afraid to go outside.

651
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:27,033
I got this crazy idea
that I'm being followed.

652
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:31,162
And this song keeps
running through my head.

653
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:34,290
"People are Strange," The Doors.

654
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:39,670
Where, "faces look evil
when you're alienated."

655
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,172
Randall...

656
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:45,301
Dead at 27 in a Paris bathtub.

657
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:48,679
I think you should go
and talk to Mel Gelbar.

658
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:52,225
He specializes in post-traumatic
stress disorder.

659
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:55,436
You couldn't prescribe something?

660
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:57,897
I'm your date, not your doctor.

661
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:01,651
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah. No.

662
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:35,893
Saw my first dead body
when I was about 15.

663
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:37,812
Maybe 16.

664
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:41,816
I won't tell you about how he
got clipped because it was...

665
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:46,654
Sorry.

666
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:48,406
You okay?

667
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:51,117
I was thinking...

668
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:55,580
I guess I live a sheltered existence.

669
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:57,206
How so?

670
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:02,712
I'm in this room for 10 hours a day.

671
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:08,801
I guess I'm out of touch with the
climate of rage in American society...

672
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:13,723
...the casual violence.

673
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:17,143
Your voice is all tight.

674
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:25,651
This week my, my friend got beat up...

675
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:28,321
...by a policeman, no less.

676
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:31,824
Oh, yeah?

677
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:34,452
It was a nightmare.

678
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:38,247
Wow.

679
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:44,462
I mean, I don't know if this cop
was crazy or drunk or what.

680
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:49,842
But he was raving, "prime rib,
hamburger," it was surreal.

681
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:52,887
Fucking moron.

682
00:48:55,849 --> 00:49:00,102
I mean, it sounds like this guy
is a fucking moron.

683
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:03,522
My friend's filing suit
against the city.

684
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:07,652
The worst part of it is, our
relationship will never be the same.

685
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:09,362
Sorry.

686
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:11,656
Oh, it wasn't your fault!

687
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:15,910
Hey, this is your session.

688
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:18,371
I'm, I'm sorry, this is...

689
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:20,414
...very unprofessional.

690
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:23,876
It's all right,
you had your wits scared out of you.

691
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:26,671
Is the Xanax helping?

692
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:30,049
It's fine, no more attacks.

693
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:34,845
But you still have your doubts?

694
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:39,809
About therapy? No, no, no, no.

695
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:44,063
Giving it another chance.
Get a lot of good ideas here.

696
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,066
Okay.

697
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:49,068
On how to cope.

698
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:58,369
Tell me why this was a smart move,
to make Junior the Big Willie.

699
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:02,873
Look at him. He's content.
Thinks he's the king of kings.

700
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:07,628
Truth is, every decision
is made by me.

701
00:50:07,879 --> 00:50:09,880
I still worry about the money end.

702
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:12,425
That's what you do, you worry.

703
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:15,428
He doesn't know what
we kick back to Jackie.

704
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:18,180
We're gonna do good.

705
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:23,394
The point is, he's got the title.
He's a happy fucking camper.

706
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:25,229
The house is secure.

707
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:29,442
Now we got a brand-new lightning rod
on top to take the hits.

708
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:31,610
Smart. Very smart.

709
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:35,239
Yeah, and now you got Bloomfield
and the union chair.

710
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:38,325
Otherwise you'd fuck me, but you
wouldn't respect me in the morning.

711
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:42,788
As long as you guarantee to keep
the old fart in line.

712
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:46,250
I still love that man.
I'm his favorite nephew.

713
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:49,045
Look at him, over there with my ma.

714
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:51,922
Those people
went through World War II.

715
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:23,704
T, check out the government.

716
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:29,627
Shooting right to left.

717
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:32,004
They got Uncle Jun's good side.
