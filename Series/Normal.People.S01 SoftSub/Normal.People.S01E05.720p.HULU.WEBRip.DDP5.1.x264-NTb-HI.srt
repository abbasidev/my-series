00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,320
Right.

178
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,360
He's actually the smartest person
I've ever met.

179
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,336
Fair enough.

180
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,656
We should probably get to the library.

181
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,776
Yeah, I obviously have a lot of work to do
to become...

182
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,176
the smartest person you've ever met, so...
(MARIANNE LAUGHING)

183
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,936
I don't think it's possible, yeah.
Ah, do you not think?

184
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,760
No.
He's the smart person you've ever met?

185
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,000
All right?

186
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,096
Well, well. Walk of fucking shame.

187
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,057
You all right, Elaine?

188
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:41,816
ELAINE: I don't think I can get you
out of this one, Connell.

189
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,896
NIALL: Good night, then.

190
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,176
CONNELL: I'm just gonna grab a shower.
(CHUCKLES) I bet you are.

191
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,456
And be out of your way.

192
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,016
Was it, though?
Good to see you, Elaine.

193
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,616
(ELAINE LAUGHS)

194
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,240
NIALL: That man's a dark horse.
He'll tell you nothing.

195
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,256
LECTURER: So, rather than
looking at modernism

196
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,056
solely as a literary phenomenon,

197
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,096
we can regard it as a historical process,

198
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,496
enfolding within and along with

199
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:08,040
other significant processes
and developments of the 1910s and '20s.

200
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,240
Thank you.

201
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,336
Oh, a bit of housekeeping.

202
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,520
Next week's lecture will be
in the Jonathan Swift.

203
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,000
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

204
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,240
Hey.

205
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,896
Hey.
Could I read your Joyce essay?

206
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,136
The one that you got that unprecedented,

207
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,400
like, literally impossible mark in.

208
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,296
Oh. Where'd you hear that?

209
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,976
Talk of the year.

210
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,656
People are competitive.
Yeah.

211
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,320
(SADIE LAUGHS)
Right.

212
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,896
I'm going to the literary society
later on.

213
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,737
Oh, right.

214
00:10:47,761 --> 00:10:50,440
Yeah, they're looking for new
members, actually. Ah, okay.

215
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,280
You look really sweet
when you're concentrating.

216
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,520
You have a really cute serious face.

217
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,176
God, I'm so distracted by
this committee bullshit.

218
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,336
There was another argument last night.

219
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,136
Phil went off on Hannah,
and I think she might resign.

220
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,496
It's just...
It's just so fucking boring, you know?

221
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,296
I, I really need to
finish this before class.

222
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,560
Sure. It's fine.

223
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,800
MARIANNE: What's it like?

224
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,480
You're, like, this star.

225
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,000
You're top of the class. (LAUGHS
SOFTLY) I don't know what you mean.

226
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,976
Do you enjoy it?

227
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,880
Being recognized like that?
Ah.

228
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,216
Don't think I'm brilliant
or anything like that.

229
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,896
Mm?
No, I mean it.

230
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,536
It's just... no one else
does their reading properly.

231
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,536
They literally show up to discuss
a book that they haven't even read,

232
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,456
and then they just bang on about it,
like, with complete confidence.

233
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,920
And then... people are fools.

234
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,240
And that bothers you?

235
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,960
(SCOFFS)

236
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,320
I suppose it does a little bit.

237
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,360
No, that's not even it. It's...
(CLEARS THROAT)

238
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,400
What upsets me is it's...

239
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,736
is that I...

240
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,736
barely know what to say
half the time, like...

241
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,040
Like outside of this. Outside of work.

242
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:03,376
Like... Like they don't have to
go around and pretend, or...

243
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,816
be anything other than themselves.
You know?

244
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,136
And I feel like I'm...

245
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,936
walking around trying on a hundred
different versions of myself.

246
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,600
It's just not working, or...

247
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,320
It doesn't seem like that.

248
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,360
From the outside, I mean.

249
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,480
Then I think about home, and...

250
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,696
school, and fuck, I just...

251
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,616
I can't connect this life and...

252
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,016
and that life. It just...

253
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,976
just doesn't fit.

254
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,080
Huh.

255
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,000
Hmm. Do your friends know about us?

256
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:58,520
Just, like... what happened at school,
or whatever?

257
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,440
No.

258
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,080
Joanna does.

259
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,120
Sort of.

260
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,680
But not the others.

261
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,480
I don't think so.

262
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,056
I mean, they may have picked up
on something, but I never told them.

263
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,360
And would you be embarrassed
if they found out?

264
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,000
That we were together in school,
or whatever?

265
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,320
Yeah.

266
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,240
In some ways.

267
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,280
Why?

268
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,120
Because it was humiliating.

269
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,360
You mean the way I treated ya?

270
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,160
Yeah.

271
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,200
And just the...
(SIGHS)

272
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,720
Just the fact that I put up with it.

273
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,440
Did you ever think about
asking me to the Debs?

274
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,856
I know, it's such a stupid thing.

275
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,816
But, uh, I'm curious whether you thought
about it. Um... (CLEARS THROAT)

276
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,200
Uh, to be honest, uh, no.

277
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,360
I wish that I did.

278
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,280
Yeah.

279
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,120
Would you have said yes?

280
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,360
Yeah.

281
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,040
(MOANS)

282
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,360
Fuck's sake.

283
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,080
I'm really sorry.

284
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,776
Apparently everybody
knew about us, anyway.

285
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,960
Everyone knew what?
That we were seeing each other.

286
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,016
I didn't tell anyone, Connell,

287
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,296
I swear to God.
Ah, fuck, I know.

288
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,336
That's not what I mean. I mean...

289
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,056
My point is is that even if
you had told people,

290
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,520
it wouldn't have mattered.

291
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,360
Were they horrible about it?

292
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,136
No.

293
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,560
(LAUGHS SOFTLY)

294
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,760
Believe it or not, no one even cared.

295
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,416
I feel really guilty

296
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,920
about all that stuff
I said to you about, uh...

297
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,616
how bad it would be
if people found out.

298
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,936
Like, obviously that was just...

299
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,640
That was just what was
going on in my head, and...

300
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,320
There'd be no reason
why anybody would care. I just...

(CONNELL CLEARS THROAT)

302
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,656
I think I just suffered from anxiety
with those sort of things.

303
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,920
I don't know. It's...

304
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,480
Yeah.

305
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,440
I still think about it all the time.
I still...

306
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,680
think about why I acted in such
a fucked up way, and I'm really sorry...

Marianne, I...
(MARIANNE SNIFFLES, EXHALES)

I forgive you.

I thought we were going to a party.
I'm sorry, I just, I...

316

felt I had to say it.

317

But we're good. I mean, this is good.
Everyone says we're good together.

I mean, that's not a reason‐‐.

319

And do they?

320
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,240
Does everyone really go
around saying that? Yeah.

321
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,536
Do people even care?

322
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,456
Yeah. I think people care
that their friends are happy, yeah.

323
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,936
Look, I'm sorry. I just‐‐
I don't think this is working.

324
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,456
It's not what I want anymore.

325

Anymore.
Yeah.

326

So you did want this at some point.

327
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,040
Wow.

328
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,080
You are literally like a completely
different person right now.

329
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,240
Sorry.

330

Are you sure you don't mind bringing me?

Sure, I'm going there myself, aren't I?

Teresa a lift?

What are you drinking?

Gin.
And...

335

Gin.
(LAUGHS)

336
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,240
Right.

337
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,936
MARIANNE:
She was talking about you.

338
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,816
Right.
You guys fighting or something?

339
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,736
Oh, are we fighting?
That's insane. Did she say that?

340
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,176
No.

341
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,936
But she said you were seeing each other.

342
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,816
And that means we're fighting, does it?

343
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,640
So you are seeing each other.

344
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,736
It's casual.

345
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,776
That's exactly what she said.

346
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,496
Did you agree between you that
that's what you were gonna tell people?

347
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,200
Not as such, I don't think.

348
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,016
You have such a nice face.
