Hmm.

Do we not trust people
to form their own opinions?

190
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,696
Yeah.
Do you need to debate a Nazi, though?

191
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,056
Like, is there value in giving
a Nazi a platform?

192
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,936

a fair bit from his kind already.

He's not a Nazi, though.

194

really careful with that word.

way too flippantly these days.

Yeah, he's a fascist, though, right?
He doesn't define himself as a fascist.

197
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,056
Fair enough. Other people do, so...

what the issue is, here.

202
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,696
It's like, by that reasoning
you'd have to invite

203
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,056
everyone everywhere to debate
about everything, or else their, like...

204
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,296

the development of discourses
around gravity,

490
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,576

and within what structures.
