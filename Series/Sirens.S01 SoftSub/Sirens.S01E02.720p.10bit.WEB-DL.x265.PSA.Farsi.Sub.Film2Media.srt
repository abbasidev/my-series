1
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:14,407
<i>Intruder detected. Intruder detected.</i>

2
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:18,203
Zeus, activate the surveillance feeds.

3
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:29,589
No.

4
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:06,209
Simone!

5
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,101
Simone!

6
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,105
Oh.

7
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,865
- Devon.
- Let me in. I'm a popsicle.

8
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,408
What the hell are you doing here?

9
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,451
You're supposed to be gone.
Why are you wet?

10
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:42,661
- Zeus. Lights.
- Oh.

11
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,621
I just Navy SEALed over
from Jordan's dinghy.

12
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:46,456
He couldn't get past the rocks,
so I had to swim.

13
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:47,958
Who's Jordan?

14
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,460
Oh, right. That's not his name.

15
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:52,546
Uh, Ethan's boat guy.

16
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,506
Yeah, I met him at a bar last night,

17
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,508
and then he took me back
to your boyfriend's boat.

18
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,802
You were on the Evelina?

19
00:02:58,386 --> 00:02:59,554
With Jordan, yeah.

20
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,015
Oh my-- Do you mean Morgan?

21
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,599
His name's Morgan?

22
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,058
Wait, I'm so confused.

23
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,894
I feel really weird about it too.

24
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,855
But then I saw your boss
in the window all bloody

25
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,690
like some kind of dark lord,

26
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,568
and I'm here to bust you out.

27
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:15,027
Let's go.

28
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,778
What the hell are you talking about?

29
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:19,072
I don't know.
She was doing some kind of, like,

30
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:24,661
uh, some sort of, like,
satanic animal sacrifice.

31
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:27,331
Wait, do you mean her bedroom window?

32
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,417
Devon, that wasn't an animal sacrifice.

33
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:33,087
Barnaby crashed through
her window and died.

34
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:34,880
Poor thing.

35
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:35,839
Who's Barnaby?

36
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,633
Her peregrine falcon.

37
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,635
Okay, that helps me not at all.

38
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,178
It's a bird, Devon.

39
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,639
What are you even doing here?
You're supposed to be gone.

40
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,225
- I'm worried about you, Simone.
- Okay, why?

41
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,852
Because this Michaela bitch
has her talons so deep in your brain

42
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:51,563
that you can't even tell you're in a cult.

43
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,482
Kiki is my friend.

44
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:57,236
Friends don't control and isolate you.

45
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,322
Friends don't kick your sister out
like trash.

46
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:03,158
And friends don't tell you
who you can and cannot date.

47
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:07,371
Friends don't buy you closets like this.
Are you kidding me? This is your room?

48
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:10,374
Okay, first of all,
I worked really hard with the designer

49
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,125
on the layout of my suite, okay?

50
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:15,712
Second, Devon,
it was my idea to kick you out.

51
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:17,756
- Ah.
- Uh-huh. And I stand by it.

52
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,926
Third, she doesn't tell me
who I can and cannot date.

53
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,844
Ethan's her husband's best friend.

54
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:25,931
It might be weird for her
to suddenly go on double dates with me.

55
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:29,435
You know,
I spray her underwear with lavender mist.

56
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:31,270
You what now?

57
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,230
Me and Ethan are not a secret.

58
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,649
I just... I haven't had a chance... Stop it!

59
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,401
- ...to tell her about us yet.
- Okay.

60
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:40,028
- But she'd be fine if she knew?
- Yes, of course she'd be fine.

61
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,655
Good, 'cause I told her.

62
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,157
Wait, what? When? Why?

63
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,826
Devon, Devon, no. Why would you do that?

64
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,578
I didn't. I was proving a point.
Look how insane you're being.

65
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,872
- You are the worst thing in my life, okay?
- Great.

66
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,582
Tell me all about it
on the way to Buffalo.

67
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,418
I'm never going back to Buffalo.

68
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,336
- It's your home.
- No, this is my home.

69
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:58,672
Stop, stop. Stop going through my stuff
and listen to me.

70
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,300
- Okay? Listen, Devon.
- Yes.

71
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,926
This is the happiest I've ever been.

72
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:06,848
Like... I love this island.

73
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,393
I love who I am here.

74
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,063
You wanted to be an attorney.

75
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:18,358
Kiki has a law degree,
and Kiki says being an attorney...

76
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:21,696
I don't care about Kiki.
Look at me. I care about you. I love you.

77
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,072
You and me,

78
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:26,491
we worked so hard to get you into Yale.

79
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:29,704
I got myself into Yale.

80
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,081
Oh, sorry.

81
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:37,085
I just thought that I dropped out
of college, moved home,

82
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:39,171
and worked three jobs
to get you through high school.

83
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,714
I didn't ask you to do that.

84
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,800
Who else was gonna do it?

85
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:48,096
Simone, I am the only person
who has always had your back.

86
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:50,350
That's not true. Kiki has my back.

87
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,852
- What?
- Are you taking your meds?

88
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,355
Hey, don't, Devon. No, don't. Don't.

89
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,608
Don't do that. Don't make this about me
when this is about you.

90
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:02,486
- Are you taking them? Yes or no?
- Yes, I take my fucking meds.

91
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,488
Oh, there she is.
Still got a little fight in her.

92
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:08,825
And fuck you
because you're not worried about me.

93
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:11,578
Devon, no.
This is about you and your shit.

94
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,372
- You just don't want to go home.
- That is...

95
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,290
And I don't blame you, okay?

96
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:19,795
But that does not mean that you get to
show up here and shit all over my success.

97
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:23,633
What success?!
You are misting underwear with lavender.

98
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,676
And by the way, I did leave.

99
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:28,303
I was the original leaver.

100
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:30,722
I just came back
'cause I'm such a good sister.

101
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,849
And I'm... Hey, I'm grateful for that.

102
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,520
Ser-- Seriously. And I always will be.

103
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:39,565
All right? But I've been out
of high school for seven years.

104
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,526
You're choosing this now.

105
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:45,153
I have never chosen anything
in my entire life, Simone.

106
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,322
Oh my God. No, okay.

107
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:48,408
What about Raymond?

108
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,327
That's my friend.

109
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:55,789
He's a married loser
who makes you feel bad about yourself.

110
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,042
Why would you spend any time with him?

111
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:05,842
I'm sorry.

112
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,553
Look, like...

113
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,722
I... I know that you're struggling, okay?

114
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:13,891
But you have to let go

115
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:15,935
of what doesn't serve you.

116
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,104
- That's what Kiki always says...
- Oh my God, stop saying her name.

117
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,648
- Kiki. Kiki. Kiki. Kiki.
- Stop saying her name.

118
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,608
- Stop it. Jesus!
- What's going on?

119
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,318
- Oh my--
- What the fuck?!

120
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,486
Is she wet?

121
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:29,739
She, uh... swam here, apparently.

122
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,616
Are you part mermaid, Devon?

123
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:34,786
Uh, if you don't mind, we're sort of
in the middle of something right now.

124
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:38,415
Oh my God, so are we. Did Simone
tell you about our recent trauma?

125
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,835
Yeah, how are you holding up?

126
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,129
- Were you able to get back to sleep?
- No, no.

127
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,506
I keep seeing
his little eyes looking at me.

128
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,508
He was trying to come home to you, Kiki.

129
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,927
- That's my theory.
- I shouldn't have let him go.

130
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:53,180
No, this is not your fault, Kiki.

131
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,057
He told me he was ready.

132
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,393
- Hey hey.
- Hey hey.

133
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:02,481
Well, I really hate
to rush your bird grief,

134
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,691
but I think we should
probably finish packing.

135
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:05,859
Are you going somewhere?

136
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,819
- Yes, we're going to Buffalo together.
- No.

137
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,112
No, I'm not, Devon.

138
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:11,073
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Yes, you are.

139
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,951
- No, I'm not.
- Mmm.

140
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:15,952
You are, though.

141
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,914
- I'm not, though.
- I'm not leaving this island without you.

142
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,957
You're gonna grow old and die here then

143
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,667
'cause, uh, I'm not leaving.

144
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,294
Mmm, cool.

145
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:27,422
I guess I'll just be right here,
festering and decomposing.

146
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:30,050
- Don't you dare sit on my couch.
- One cheek, two cheek.

147
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:33,803
Oh, I... I love this for you two,
this little pre-dawn sister spat,

148
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,805
but I have got to get some rest.

149
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:39,893
Devon, let's move you to the guest house.
You'll be much more comfortable there.

150
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:40,811
Jose.

151
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:43,105
What?

152
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,691
Will you follow me, Miss DeWitt?

153
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,195
Uh, no, I'm going to stay here.

154
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,865
Oh, thank you for understanding.

155
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:55,450
But...

156
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:58,036
Jose, let's meet tomorrow to discuss

157
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,540
the security breach
that occurred on your watch.

158
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,583
- Of course, <i>mi amor.</i> This way, please.
- Thank you.

159
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:05,419
Sweet dreams, Devon.

160
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,725
They sleep together?

161
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,271
Ugh! God, every time I think
this place can't get more fucked,

162
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,689
it just gets more fucked.

163
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,857
I told you to leave
and never come back, dummy.

164
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:31,862
What was I supposed to do?
My sister is clearly in trouble.

165
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,073
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

166
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,159
Are you kidding me?

167
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,537
Breaking and entering and trespassing.

168
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,123
Are you fucking kidding me right now?

169
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,001
Devon DeWitt,
you have the right to remain silent.

170
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:49,004
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

171
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,716
- You have a right to an attorney.
- If you cannot afford one...

172
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,393
Hey, Simone.

173
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,313
Mmm, Kiki.

174
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:09,400
Why didn't you tell me you had a sister?

175
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,403
Um...

176
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,493
It's... just hard to explain.

177
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,247
- It all kinda is.
- Hmm.

178
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,458
- I get that.
- Hmm.

179
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:30,546
It seems like an omission, though,
when you know so much about me.

180
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,216
She just has issues.

181
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,595
She spends all her time
with my alcoholic dad.

182
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:41,973
Another lost soul washed up
on our island, huh?

183
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,142
Hmm.

184
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,687
How old was she when your mom died?

185
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:48,731
Twelve.

186
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,277
That's a tough age.

187
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:55,446
I mean,

188
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:59,492
my mom was sick, so that was

189
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,202
an explanation,

190
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:06,123
but a drunk driver killing your mother
must have left the two of you in such...

191
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:08,876
such despair.

192
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:11,545
Yeah.

193
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:15,633
It's just so...

194
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:20,012
odd that you chose
not to mention her to me.

195
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,974
She makes me sad, Kiki.

196
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,814
I didn't want to be sad here.

197
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,024
That's all.

198
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,322
Is there anything else
you haven't told me, for whatever reason?

199
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:40,950
I won't be angry.

200
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,750
You know everything about me.

201
00:11:57,758 --> 00:12:02,221
The Mandolina. Or the Gordita.

202
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,515
The Eddie-lina? Something-lina.

203
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:08,226
Anyway, whatever. It doesn't matter
what the boat was called, okay?

204
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:11,271
I wasn't breaking into the Cliff House

205
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,190
because I am a guest

206
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,150
at the Cliff House.

207
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,694
Hmm. Not according to Mrs. Kell.

208
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,488
Well, of course she would say that.
You know what else she's doing?

209
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:23,241
Holding my sister, Simone, there
against her will.

210
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,035
I love Simone.

211
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,121
She got me <i>Hamilton</i> tickets.

212
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,709
I don't think she's a prisoner.
She seems pretty happy to me.

213
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,836
She's brainwashed!

214
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,464
Do you have any priors, Miss DeWitt?

215
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:17,439
Mr. Kell, I had no idea that you were up.
Missy said that you were sleeping.

216
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:21,776
No, I couldn't sleep.
I'm all turned around with this jet lag.

217
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:24,028
Here, let me do that for you.

218
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,239
Please, I got it.

219
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,451
- How are things?
- Things are good.

220
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,161
- Getting ready for the gala.
- Hmm.

221
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:34,205
Battening down the hatches
and that kind of thing.

222
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,666
Uh-huh. How's the little guy, Tyson?

223
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:40,044
Well, he's not very little anymore.
He just turned 13.

224
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,255
No. He's a teenager?

225
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:45,717
Yep. He just got
his purple belt in karate, actually.

226
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,845
Oh boy. Not gonna mess with him.

227
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,722
Can I make you some breakfast?

228
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,891
Or dinner, I guess, at this point?
You were so delayed.

229
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,017
No, thanks.

230
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,770
I'm good with the caffeine and the <i>Times</i>.

231
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:04,527
Remember when I had teenagers
running around in here, Patrice?

232
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:05,570
Yeah.

233
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:09,741
Rory ate so much, I couldn't even keep
the pantry stocked up enough for him.

234
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:13,578
And Sarah, upstairs,
blasting Taylor Swift at all hours.

235
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,789
It used to drive me crazy back then.

236
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,378
You treasure this time with your boy.

237
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,381
These are the best times of your life.

238
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,926
I will. I do.

239
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,478
- So, what's your name?
- I'm Devon.

240
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:41,314
- Kevin?
- No, Devon. With a D.

241
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:44,150
- So, what did you get busted for?
- Trespassing.

242
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,111
Tight! What house?

243
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,240
I don't know. Some mansion on a cliff.

244
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:52,785
The Cliff House?

245
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,375
You tried to break into
Michaela Kell's house?

246
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:03,379
- You know her.
- No, I don't.

247
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,674
- Kinda seems like you do.
- Mm-mm.

248
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,553
Careful what you say.
They have spies everywhere.

249
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,558
Oh. Okay.

250
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,062
I know the kids.

251
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,440
Rory and Sarah Kell went
to boarding school with me.

252
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,651
Wait. Peter and Michaela have kids?

253
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,569
No.

254
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,237
Not Michaela.

255
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,907
Their mom's Jocelyn Kell, the first wife.

256
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,370
But no one's seen or heard from her
since Michaela showed up.

257
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,081
Like, not a peep.

258
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:43,793
And you know,
I don't like to spread rumors, Kevin,

259
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:47,423
but... people think she killed her.

260
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,051
People think Michaela
killed the first wife?

261
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:52,970
Yes.

262
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,474
Okay, but not like actual murder, right?

263
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:02,353
I mean, not like,
Michaela with a lead pipe in the library.

264
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,606
She pushed her off a cliff.

265
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,071
I'm telling you, she's a monster.

266
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,663
Hey, have you, uh,

267
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:23,666
ever heard anything
about it being a... a cult?

268
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,543
Oh, it's definitely a cult. Yeah, yeah.

269
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,880
But to be fair, I think everything's
a cult because I was in NXIVM briefly.

270
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,673
- Shut up.
- I know.

271
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:33,093
I was supposed to be in the documentary,
but I got adult mono.

272
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:35,679
Okay.

273
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,142
How did you get out of the cult?

274
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:47,732
Look who's up.

275
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,651
Hey. How you holding up?

276
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:53,613
I heard about the bird
kamakaze-ing through the window.

277
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:54,531
You okay?

278
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:57,868
Barnaby. His name was Barnaby.

279
00:17:58,869 --> 00:17:59,703
Right.

280
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,914
I'm so sorry, honey.

281
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:06,000
I came in to comfort you,
but you were already gone.

282
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:08,837
Jose said that you slept with Simone.

283
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,090
Well, I was upset,
and you were nowhere to be found.

284
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:16,427
{\an8}I know. But you think
you should be so cuddly with Simone?

285
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,846
I mean, she's your employee, honey.

286
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:20,723
Can you give us a minute, Patrice?

287
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:22,683
Yes. Sorry, Mrs. Kell.

288
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:26,188
- Carl.
- Thanks, Patrice. Appreciate you, Carl.

289
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,191
I sexted you yesterday.

290
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,693
Ah. Did I forget to write you back?

291
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:35,363
You saw it. It was seen.

292
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:38,908
Oh, Lewis was talking my ear off
on the whole flight,

293
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:42,245
and it just felt weird
to be sexting with my wife

294
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,789
while he was droning on
about security futures.

295
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,707
Hmm.

296
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,085
Can I make it up to you?

297
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,420
My morning is blissfully free.

298
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:52,631
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

299
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,341
Sorry. Um...

300
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,468
Oh, Simone, it's okay. Come on in.

301
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,387
- Good morning, Simone.
- Good morning.

302
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:02,265
Thank you for working
on a holiday weekend.

303
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,433
Oh, my pleasure. Welcome home.

304
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:08,020
Oh, I printed you out
the itinerary for today.

305
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:10,231
- Because I know you like a hard copy.
- All right.

306
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,233
- Rockin' it analog.
- Right.

307
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,943
Whoa.

308
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:16,696
<i>Vanity Fair</i> is today?
I thought we already did that.

309
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,657
No, no. That was the interview.
Today's the photo shoot with everyone.

310
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,659
Ah. No. I can't do it today. I'm busy.

311
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,829
- You just said you were blissfully free.
- For fun stuff.

312
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,372
I'll give you two some space.

313
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:28,416
No. It's okay, Simone. You can stay.

314
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,668
What is it with you recently?

315
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,588
Don't you care
about raptor conservation anymore?

316
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:36,132
- You know I do.
- Well, we need this PR.

317
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,551
The preserve needs this PR.

318
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:42,471
We're asking folks to plonk down
$10,000 a plate for this gala,

319
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:44,807
so you need to be in the photo.

320
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,143
You and me.

321
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:48,896
You're absolutely right.

322
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:50,480
I'll be there.

323
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,152
- I got something for you.
- Yeah?

324
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,033
From Magpie.

325
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,576
Aw.

326
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:07,413
You're the sweetest.
Every time you're in Tokyo, you remember.

327
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:08,332
Hey.

328
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:12,752
This is from Magpie Chocolate
on Cat Street in Harajuku?

329
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,503
Mm-hmm. Made a special trip.

330
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:17,299
- Love you, honey.
- Aw. I love you.

331
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,679
Hello. This is Simone for Mrs. Kell.

332
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,147
Good morning. Good morning.

333
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,482
What's your ETA here?

334
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:37,151
The ETA for installing an oversized
eyelash window with storm-rated...

335
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:38,486
Just give me a time.

336
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,321
- Two hours.
- Okay.

337
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,740
Uh, small change of plan.

338
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:46,953
Michaela wants to do Barnaby's funeral
on the beach after the photo shoot,

339
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,955
so I need you guys to pause here

340
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:51,290
and, chop-chop, go set that up.

341
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,709
We're in the middle of installing
an oversized eyelash window...

342
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,044
- Right.
- ...with storm-rated glass.

343
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:57,463
But we need
30 folding chairs on the beach,

344
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:59,340
flower arrangements, candles, a podium.

345
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:02,218
Kiki's got an oboist coming in. A harp.

346
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:05,930
- Harp? Excellent.
- Yeah. She wants beachy, carefree.

347
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,182
- No stress but deeply elegant.
- Harp on the beach.

348
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,475
And designed.

349
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,061
Mm-hmm.

350
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:14,231
Stop texting about me, Jose.

351
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:15,857
I'm not.

352
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:21,863
Oh. Um...

353
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,366
Hi. Uh...

354
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,245
Thanks for returning my call.

355
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,247
Um...

356
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:32,915
Correct.

357
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:36,836
Mrs. Kell wants the chocolate
from the Tokyo location,

358
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,047
Cat Street in Harajuku.

359
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,632
No. Yeah. Yeah.

360
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:45,720
She knows that
there's a Magpie Chocolate in SoHo,

361
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:49,725
but she wants it from Tokyo,
overnighted here.

362
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:52,518
I don't know why,

363
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:57,149
but, um, it's what she wants,
so just charge us whatever.

364
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,026
Okay. <i>Arigato.</i>

365
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:20,046
No, my dad would
literally play volleyball with Keith.

366
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,965
Just bump, set, spike. All smiles.

367
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:25,259
He even went to some
of the weird scarf meetings,

368
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,805
and everyone thought he was,
like, in NXIVM for real. So silly.

369
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:33,894
But, yeah, he just played along,
and then one day, boom, I was out.

370
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,146
So, he just fully integrated himself.

371
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:39,107
Yeah. For me.

372
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:41,109
Interesting.

373
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:45,279
DeWitt! Time to go.

374
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,822
Go where?

375
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:49,159
- Unless you'd rather stay.
- No, thank you.

376
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:52,954
- Good luck, Kevin.
- See you, Lily-Rose.

377
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,415
I have to do the other side.

378
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:57,376
Ma'am?

379
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:00,962
Well, that looks ridiculous.
She looks like shit.

380
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,132
Watch your step.

381
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,134
Raise your arms.

382
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,054
Oh, you can leave her cuffed, Rosie.

383
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:10,639
- Oh, sure.
- Mm-hmm.

384
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,308
Ow. My God.

385
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:17,145
How's your dad, honey?

386
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:20,648
He's in remission now.
Yeah, thanks for asking.

387
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:23,818
He was so touched by
the edible arrangement you sent.

388
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:26,320
Oh, well, he's always in our prayers.

389
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:28,407
- Thanks.
- You can leave us now. Thank you.

390
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,288
Officer Coffin's a friend of mine.

391
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:38,999
She called me after she ran your name
in the system and found out

392
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,503
you'd been arrested
48 hours ago in Buffalo.

393
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:46,341
Uh, driving under the influence,
resisting arrest.

394
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:51,596
You threw a Four Loko at a cop
and called him a little bitch?

395
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:55,349
- Sounds like me.
- Are you aware of what a big deal this is?

396
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,852
It's your second DUI.

397
00:23:57,727 --> 00:24:00,981
In New York State, that's grounds
for up to four years in jail.

398
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,066
Did you tell Simone about this?

399
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:05,693
No. No.

400
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:10,282
I thought that, um, with your mom,
it would be too upsetting for her.

401
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:13,826
What do you mean?

402
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:16,246
Well, your mother was killed
by a drunk driver.

403
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:18,540
Oh.

404
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:20,625
Right.

405
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,591
Can I do something for you,

406
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,093
or did you just come
to read me my rap sheet?

407
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:32,887
Well, you know,
to be honest with you, Devon,

408
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:36,724
I was gonna just let you simmer
in here for a day to prove a point,

409
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:40,811
but I do not want to be the reason
you're extradited home to do hard time.

410
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,021
That's very generous of you.

411
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:43,230
These are my terms.

412
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:46,775
You go directly to the ferry
right now and go home.

413
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:48,611
For real this time.

414
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:49,613
- Or...
- No.

415
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,739
- Or... Or...
- Mm-mm. No, no, no.

416
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,827
You can accept my apology
for bad behavior.

417
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:58,747
Very bad behavior.

418
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:04,085
And give me another chance, as your guest.

419
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:06,838
Why would I do that?

420
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,050
Because you're merciful.

421
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,221
And we both love Simone.

422
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:19,768
Simone has made it crystal clear
that she wants you to go.

423
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,688
You don't have a sister, do you?

424
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,191
Sisters say mean shit all the time.

425
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,276
I mean, they claw each other's faces off,

426
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:32,572
but no one knows you like a sister,
and no one loves you better.

427
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,200
Trust me, Simone and I are very close.

428
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,035
Yeah?

429
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:41,038
If you're so close,
then why didn't she tell me about you?

430
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,167
If you're so close,
why didn't she tell you about me?

431
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:49,421
Seems like one of us doesn't know Simone
as well as we thought we did.

432
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:52,050
That'd be you. I know her super well.
I was just being rhetorical.

433
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:55,929
You know, Devon,
I'm not the monster that you think I am.

434
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:59,056
I take care of everything in my orb.

435
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,559
Big and small.

436
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,644
Prey and predator.

437
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:04,271
I know.

438
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:07,816
Maybe you can help me.

439
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,819
Let me stay for the weekend.

440
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:13,863
And take me under your wing.

441
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,080
Please help me.

442
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:24,749
Like you helped Simone.

443
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,877
Teach me the "hey hey heys."

444
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:35,551
All right, but you step out of line once

445
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:39,221
or you interfere with my gala in any way,
and I will put you right back in here.

446
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:40,180
Understood.

447
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:42,058
- Or worse.
- I don't doubt it.

448
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:47,314
Jose is outside.

449
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:49,732
He will bring you back to the house.

450
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:52,110
Thank you, Michaela. Really.

451
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,154
And it's "hey hey."

452
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:36,862
Whoo!

453
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:38,406
Nice work, boys!

454
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:40,866
Hey, guys.

455
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:43,369
Hi. Uh, this just in.

456
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:47,206
Michaela is concerned
about it being too salty down there,

457
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:50,501
so she wants to move
the funeral to the aviary.

458
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:53,003
- All those chairs need to come back up.
- But we just--

459
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,589
Thank you so much.

460
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,968
Okay, here we are.

461
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:02,513
Please, come in. Make yourself at home.

462
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,057
Mrs. Kell had us buy you
some new clothes, okay?

463
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,059
They're upstairs in the bedroom.

464
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:10,062
Uh, the ones you arrived in
are gonna be laundered, so.

465
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:11,146
- Great.
- Yeah.

466
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:16,194
She would also love for you to change
before being seen on the property.

467
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:17,861
- Copy that.
- Yeah.

468
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:20,489
I imagine you're gonna want
to take a little nap, no?

469
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,157
Well, after your night in the slammer.

470
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:24,411
Hmm. Ha-ha.

471
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:25,954
Hey.

472
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:27,914
Anything else you need?

473
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:31,542
Um, yeah, I need my phone back
from Morgan. He works for Ethan.

474
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,669
Certainly. We can reach out to him.

475
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:37,256
And I'm going to tell Simone that
you are back from the lighthouse tour.

476
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:38,591
<i>¿Sí?</i>

477
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,259
Thank you, Jose.

478
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,179
Good. Stay out of trouble, neck-licker.

479
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:46,390
- Hey.
- Bye.

480
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,851
<i>Adiós</i>.

481
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,527
Fuck you, Michaela.

482
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:06,745
Fuck you, Michaela.

483
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,124
Fuck you, Michaela.

484
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:27,599
Fuck you, Michaela.

485
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:56,461
You're late. Head over to HMU.

486
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:58,713
- Uh, who?
- Hair and makeup.

487
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:02,633
Oh, I'm not a part of... whatever this is.

488
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,010
I'm just looking for Simone.

489
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:05,595
She's in VIP.

490
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:07,347
Upstairs.

491
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:31,579
Simone?

492
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:40,755
Simone?

493
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:45,760
Simone?

494
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:49,389
Ahh!

495
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,390
Hi!

496
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:52,307
Jesus!

497
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:54,435
Oh my God, Dev.

498
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,271
- You look gorgeous.
- Uh...

499
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,147
What the fuck is on their face?

500
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:01,066
It's an infrared sauna mask.

501
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:04,528
- You want to try it? It feels amazing.
- It's great for eczema.

502
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,281
I don't have, uh...

503
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:08,740
What is all this?

504
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:10,742
Uh, it's glam for the <i>Vanity Fair</i> shoot.

505
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:13,912
They're doing a feature
on the Preservation Society.

506
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:15,998
This is the VIP glam area.

507
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:18,375
This is Cloe, Lisa, and Astrid.

508
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:19,835
Hi!

509
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:21,170
Okay. Hi.

510
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:22,838
How was town?

511
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,716
Kiki said you did the lighthouse tour.

512
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:28,176
Well, you know me and lighthouses.

513
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:30,137
Actually, can we get back to this?

514
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:33,974
Could you make this, um,
a... a touch messier?

515
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,311
It just looks a little too planned.

516
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:37,854
Of course.

517
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:41,315
You must be starving.
Don't let us keep you from the buffet.

518
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,357
Hmm.

519
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:43,859
I, uh... I am.

520
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:47,405
Uh, I can't find it, though. Can you...
Can you show me where it is, Simone?

521
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:49,781
Do you mind, Kiki?

522
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:51,451
Mmm, I'll grab you for the meeting.

523
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,453
Bye, Devon!

524
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:56,663
Bye!

525
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:58,665
Cloe, Lisa, and Astrid.

526
00:31:58,666 --> 00:31:59,751
Ah.

527
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,554
- It's good, right?
- Mmm.

528
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:14,431
- Very. Listen...
- Try the coffee.

529
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,975
Kiki imports
this Peruvian fair trade coffee.

530
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,268
All the proceeds go--

531
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:21,146
Listen, I have to tell you something.
It's really important.

532
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:22,065
Okay.

533
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:23,942
I, um...

534
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:26,194
I don't really know

535
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:28,487
where to begin.

536
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:31,198
You look... Like, you look really pretty.

537
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,407
That's not--

538
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:35,953
No, the only person who doesn't know
how beautiful you are... is you.

539
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,120
Barf.

540
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:38,373
Okay. Um...

541
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:39,832
I just...

542
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:42,627
Yeah, go ahead.

543
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:44,629
I wanted to say that, um...

544
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:49,717
I know what you mean about Michaela.

545
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:51,343
You know?

546
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:54,055
And that you look good,
and you seem well here, so,

547
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,265
she's good for you.

548
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:58,977
And I'm sorry.

549
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,229
Is this a trick, or...

550
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,773
No! Your friends are my friends.

551
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:07,442
I want to embrace Michaela and Ethan,

552
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:09,779
and all of us are gonna have
a great weekend together.

553
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:11,113
Okay.

554
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,115
This is quite a change of heart.

555
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,825
She's a very generous woman,

556
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,452
and I'm very grateful
that she invited me to stay.

557
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:19,706
I'm so sorry.
I need to steal her for a sec.

558
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:22,291
Uh, wait, hold on.

559
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:32,175
You're wearing normal clothes.
Do you work for <i>Vanity Fair</i>?

560
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:36,221
I do contract work occasionally.
You think this is cream cheese?

561
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:38,307
I don't know. Um, are you a reporter?

562
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:40,018
Photographer. Why?

563
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:45,356
Okay, if I wanted to, like,
blow the whistle on someone, like...

564
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,609
- How do you mean?
- Uh...

565
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:51,487
Well, I have a story.

566
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:53,031
But it's, uh...

567
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,200
it's cult activity and potential murder.

568
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:58,494
Pass.

569
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:00,580
Why?

570
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:04,332
These are bad people. Do you not care?

571
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:07,169
Of course they're bad people.
Look at their house.

572
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,713
Does it honestly not bother you
to work for people like this?

573
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:13,633
Ah, well, my kid needs braces,
and my wife wants a farmhouse kitchen.

574
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:16,763
Well, you're missing out on
the story of a lifetime.

575
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:18,306
Lifetime.

576
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:24,686
What are you wearing?

577
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:27,440
No, the stylist pulled an outfit for you.

578
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:31,818
- I haven't changed yet, my love.
- But the photographer's here.

579
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:33,236
Can we do this fast?

580
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:36,031
This might be best discussed
with just you and Mr. Kell.

581
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,742
Why?

582
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:41,078
Miss DeWitt, would you give us
a moment, please?

583
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:45,374
I would love a flat white,
if you don't mind grabbing me one.

584
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,376
Are you okay, Simone?

585
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:49,961
Hey, can you grab me a scone too?

586
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:50,921
Uh-- Yeah, sure.

587
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:55,467
Uh, one... flat white
and a scone coming right up.

588
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:57,637
- Don't use whole milk. He'll bloat.
- Okay.

589
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:01,306
Are you wearing Crocs?

590
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:04,392
I repeat. I haven't changed yet.

591
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:07,604
All right, can we do this?
What's up, Jose?

592
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:10,273
Well, since last night's security breach,

593
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,234
I was reviewing our surveillance feeds,

594
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:15,238
and I found something
I thought you might want to see.

595
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:19,075
This is at 12:23 a.m. two nights ago.

596
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,536
She's taking a walk.

597
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:25,455
Mmm, fine, but why deactivate the camera?

598
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:27,791
Clearly she doesn't know
I have another angle.

599
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:31,879
{\an8}She returns at 5:16 a.m.
and reactivates the camera.

600
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:35,298
Well, maybe she fell asleep on the beach.

601
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,425
Turns out it's a bit of a pattern.

602
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:39,720
There she is the night before,

603
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,682
deactivating at midnight,

604
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,434
reactivating at dawn.

605
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:50,272
She did the same thing
four times last week.

606
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,773
Three times the week before.

607
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:55,485
Uh, I don't understand.
Where would she be sneaking off to?

608
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:57,320
The only thing out there is ocean.

609
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:58,572
And Ethan's house.

610
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:00,908
- Why would she go to Ethan's house?
- Peter.

611
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:07,122
No. He wouldn't do that, would he?

612
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:08,123
Oh, yes, he would.

613
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:11,293
She's just his type,
25 and just here for the summer.

614
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,837
Why do you have such gross friends?

615
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,464
He's your friend too.

616
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:19,593
I can't believe it.
She's been lying to my face about this

617
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,679
and sneaking around with that dog.

618
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:25,599
- Maybe they're in love.
- What?

619
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,852
I mean, she's smarter than the models

620
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:31,062
that he chews up
and spits out every summer.

621
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:32,272
She's sweeter too.

622
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,025
Why aren't you mad?

623
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:35,734
Be mad.

624
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,778
I'm very mad.

625
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:42,449
She works here.
It's very poor judgment on his part.

626
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:45,870
I'm just trying to,
you know, understand his POV.

627
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,705
Fine. I'll handle it.

628
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:51,792
- What are you going to do?
- I am going to handle it.

629
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:56,004
Hey, I'm Devon. I don't think we've met.

630
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:57,088
Patrice. Hello.

631
00:36:57,089 --> 00:37:00,508
Hi. Nice to meet you, Patrice.
Have you seen, uh, Simone anywhere?

632
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:01,927
No, I haven't.

633
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:02,845
Okay.

634
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,058
Simone? Are you back here?

635
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:16,692
Simone?

636
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,028
Simone?

637
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:22,448
Patrice, where's Simone?

638
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:25,117
I haven't seen her, Mrs. Kell.

639
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:41,842
Hey, guys.

640
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,386
Hello, Devon.

641
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,596
Let me ask you guys something. Um...

642
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:47,681
What is all this?

643
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:50,685
You guys are in a...
like, in a group with Michaela?

644
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:54,396
We're the Folger Glen
Wildlife Preservation Society.

645
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:57,566
- Our work is deeply meaningful.
- Mmm.

646
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,277
I'm Astrid.

647
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:00,945
Yeah.

648
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:04,990
Um, and what do you guys preserve?

649
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,658
It's, like, birds?

650
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,118
Mostly raptors.

651
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,287
Kiki took what was a tiny gardening club

652
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:13,665
and transformed us
into a fundraising juggernaut.

653
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:16,293
What she and Peter are doing here
is very special.

654
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:19,505
Very special. It's very meaningful.

655
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:22,008
Mmm.

656
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:24,969
Okay.

657
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:30,557
Hey, Missy.

658
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,350
Uh, have you seen Simone?

659
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:33,601
<i>No hablo inglés.</i>

660
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:35,687
No, no, it's Devon. We met yesterday.

661
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:38,024
- Oh. Look at you all pinkity-dinkity.
- Yeah.

662
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:40,066
No, I haven't seen Simone.

663
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:42,068
- You want a cranberry spritzer?
- I'm sober.

664
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:44,195
This side's virgin.
It's basically Kool-Aid.

665
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:46,866
Yeah, I'm not gonna drink the Kool-Aid.
Thanks, though.

666
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:57,460
All set?

667
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,627
Thank you. I appreciate it.

668
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:00,587
Oh. Eh...

669
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:03,424
Hey, Mic, look at you! Whoo!

670
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:05,176
You look fine.

671
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:08,428
<i>Oh, Mickey, you're so fine
You're so fine you blow my mind</i>

672
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:09,472
<i>Hey, Mickey!</i>

673
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:14,642
Uh, I just said some really nice things
about you to that <i>Vanity Fair</i> guy.

674
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:16,979
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

675
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,522
- Where's Pete? Getting dressed?
- Yes.

676
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,066
Peter's getting dressed.

677
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,068
Okay.

678
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,986
You okay, Mickeroo?

679
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:26,071
I'm great.

680
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,699
How are you? Having a nice summer?

681
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:31,534
- Uh... Yeah, super great summer.
- Mmm.

682
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,286
- Yeah, I learned to windsurf.
- Oh.

683
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:34,872
Pretty awesome.

684
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,998
Yep. Hate for it to end.

685
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:38,834
Oh, everything ends.

686
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:42,629
Okay.

687
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:46,634
A little "glass half empty" over here.
Let me get you a drink, my friend.

688
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,226
Simone?

689
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:33,389
Smells good up here.

690
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,189
I didn't think smoking was allowed.

691
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,608
For me, the rules are different.

692
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:47,736
- Peter.
- Peter Kell?

693
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,781
Oh, shit. You're the big cheese.

694
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:56,745
Do you promise to exclusively call me
Big Cheese from here on?

695
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,457
Whatever floats your boat, Big Cheese.

696
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,541
I'm Devon.

697
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:02,460
I know.

698
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:06,421
You made quite a ruckus
last night when you arrived.

699
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,548
First the bird, and then you.

700
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:09,800
Sorry about that.

701
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:12,886
I was just trying to see my sister.

702
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:16,182
Next time,
you might find the doorbell easier.

703
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:21,812
We really love Simone, by the way.

704
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,231
She's been great for Michaela.

705
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:26,734
She's really helped her.

706
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:28,985
Uh, what... what do you mean, helped her?

707
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:32,740
Well, my wife's been through a lot.

708
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,241
Uh-huh.

709
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,161
What happened to her?

710
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:41,707
No, no, I just mean that your sister

711
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:44,167
is a great assistant.

712
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,084
Oh yeah.

713
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:46,003
Yeah.

714
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,841
Quite the house you guys got here.

715
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,385
Plenty of room for kids, huh?

716
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,179
You got any kids, Big Cheese?

717
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:59,600
Like with a...
like an earlier first marriage, or...

718
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:05,021
Sorry, I don't mean to pry.

719
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:06,649
No, no, no, not at all.

720
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:10,735
Yeah, I have... I have two kids
from a previous marriage,

721
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:12,696
but they're adults now.

722
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,156
Cool, cool.

723
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:18,285
Where is she, though? Your ex?

724
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:21,497
Oh, she's not really around.

725
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:22,957
Ah.

726
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:24,833
That's too bad.

727
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,838
She's alive, though, right?

728
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,597
Why are you asking me all these questions?

729
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,059
I don't know.

730
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,687
Just chatting you up, Big Cheese.

731
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:47,773
Feeling chatty.

732
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:50,150
Kind of snacky too.

733
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,031
Nah, you finish it.

734
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:07,835
<i>All right, everybody, look over here.</i>

735
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:15,217
Stunning.

736
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:17,428
You look great, everybody.

737
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:23,183
Simone, are you down here?

738
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:27,229
I'm always looking for this bitch.

739
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,107
Simone?

740
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:32,443
Can I help you?

741
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,112
Oh, hey. Uh...

742
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,323
Hey, buddy. Um...

743
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:41,409
Have you seen, um, Michaela's assistant?

744
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:44,495
Uh, I think her name is, uh, Simone?

745
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:46,373
Nope.

746
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,208
Okay, thanks.

747
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:33,128
Damn it, Simone.

748
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:46,392
Hey, Morgan! Morgan!

749
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:57,152
Morgan!

750
00:44:57,903 --> 00:44:59,487
- Hey.
- Hey.

751
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:00,905
I, uh, brought your phone.

752
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:03,157
Whoa. What happened to you?

753
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:05,827
- I know, I'm hideous.
- I charged it for you.

754
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:07,371
You're a saint.

755
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:11,250
You sure get a lot of calls from Raymond,
whoever that is.

756
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:13,918
- Who is he?
- Uh...

757
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:15,796
- Uh, my boss.
- Oh.

758
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:20,008
It was, uh, really nice
hanging out with you last night.

759
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:23,721
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

760
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:28,725
So what's with the Stepford wife dress?
Can't beat 'em, join 'em?

761
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:29,852
No, I'm, uh...

762
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:33,230
- I'm undercover.
- Oh.

763
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,399
Should I be whispering?

764
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,650
This bitch kills people.

765
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:41,195
So I'm pretending to drink the Kool-Aid
so I can bust my sister out of here.

766
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:42,114
Oh.

767
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:45,700
Does that mean you're gonna be, uh,
sticking around for a few days?

768
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:47,785
Oh shit. I really should take this.

769
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:49,078
Sure. Sure.

770
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:51,165
- Would you want to grab dinner later?
- It's my boss.

771
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:54,001
Hey, fuckboy.

772
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:15,647
Jose, where is Simone?

773
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:18,399
- She has the eulogy on her phone.
- Uh...

774
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,317
Go find her.

775
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:21,195
Please and thank you, Jose.

776
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,821
My pleasure, Peter.

777
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:45,384
<i>Thank you for
being here tonight to remember Barnaby.</i>

778
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:46,969
<i>It tastes like cardboard.</i>

779
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:49,096
- <i>My falafels are fantastic.
- Falafel garbage.</i>

780
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:50,473
<i>Devon. Devon.</i>

781
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:52,892
<i>- Are you even listening to me?</i>
- Yeah.

782
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,936
Where the hell did everybody go?

783
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:57,396
- <i>Devon.</i>
- Sorry. Uh, say it... say it again.

784
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:59,524
<i>No fucking way!</i>

785
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:02,860
It's just for the weekend, Ray.
I'm gonna be back Tuesday. I promise.

786
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:06,280
<i>- No, I'm not--
- This asshole bought light beer.</i>

787
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:08,366
<i>I'm not taking care of
your dad until Tuesday.</i>

788
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:09,784
<i>- Light beer!</i>
- <i>I've got a life!</i>

789
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:10,868
No, he...

790
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:12,663
- <i>No!</i>
- <i>Light beer!</i>

791
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:15,873
Uh, he's... he's fine during the day.

792
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:18,084
You just have to do mornings and evenings.

793
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:19,001
<i>No!</i>

794
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:21,838
<i>No, Devon.
I refuse to take care of your grumpy dad</i>

795
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:24,882
<i>while you play dress-up
on paradise island, okay?</i>

796
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:26,509
<i>And do not say you're gonna call Allie,</i>

797
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:29,303
<i>because I refuse to believe
that you'd destroy my life like that.</i>

798
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:30,847
<i>You're not that crazy.</i>

799
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:33,474
- Oh, you don't know crazy.
- <i>I do know crazy.</i>

800
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:36,185
<i>It's staring at me right now.
Bruce, you put that down.</i>

801
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:37,520
- <i>No.</i>
- Uh--

802
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:40,106
<i>Your dad's threatening me
with the poker thing from the fireplace.</i>

803
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:43,526
Okay, no, he's just confused who you are.
Daddy, that's Ray. Remember Ray?

804
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:45,111
<i>Come on, man. You know me. Ray.</i>

805
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:47,781
<i>- I was prom king, man. You remember that.</i>
- Shit.

806
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:58,082
<i>If something seized my life tonight</i>

807
00:47:58,083 --> 00:48:02,128
<i>If a sudden wind swept through me
Changing everything</i>

808
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:03,839
<i>I would not resist</i>

809
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:08,510
<i>I am ready for whatever comes</i>

810
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:12,139
<i>But I think it will be something small</i>

811
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:15,934
<i>An animal padding out from the shadows</i>

812
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:22,190
<i>Or a word spoken so softly
I hear it inside</i>

813
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:25,652
<i>It is dark out here, and cold</i>

814
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:28,655
<i>The moon is stone</i>

815
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:31,783
<i>I am alone with my longing</i>

816
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:34,661
<i>Nothing is happening</i>

817
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:38,373
<i>But the next breath</i>

818
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:45,923
Hey hey.

819
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:47,507
Hey hey.

820
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:55,933
You okay?

821
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,481
Thank you so much for coming.

822
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,441
It was just so sudden.

823
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:14,408
Beautiful service, Mickeroo.

824
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:15,368
- Really.
- Thank you.

825
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:17,453
So lovely that you spoke from the heart.

826
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:19,163
It was really lovely, honey.

827
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:21,792
Stirred up so much emotion in me.

828
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:23,793
Need to walk it off.

829
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,087
Ethan,

830
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:27,839
would you go with me to the cliff?

831
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:31,301
Yeah. It would be my honor, Mickeroo.

832
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:34,262
- Can I bring my cookie?
- Of course.

833
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:03,500
Jesus.

834
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:06,127
Oh Christ, Jose,
you have to stop doing that to me.

835
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:07,420
Come with me. Right now.

836
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:08,505
Come. Come on.

837
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:16,887
- What happened?
- I found her like this.

838
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:20,558
- Do you want me to call an ambulance?
- No, it's okay. I got it. Thank you.

839
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:21,560
Simone.

840
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:23,854
{\an8}Simone, it's me. I'm right here.

841
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:25,271
{\an8}It's okay.

842
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:26,690
{\an8}Shh. You're okay.

843
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:32,237
Come here. It's okay.

844
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:34,990
I got you. You're okay.
