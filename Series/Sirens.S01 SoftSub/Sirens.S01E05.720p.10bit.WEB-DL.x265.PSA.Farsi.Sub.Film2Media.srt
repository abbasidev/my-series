1
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:29,278
Hey, it's okay.

2
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,238
I'm here.

3
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,451
Hi.

4
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:37,328
Huh.

5
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:38,705
Hey.

6
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,757
I thought you went home.

7
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:52,177
And miss this bangin' playlist?
Yeah, right.

8
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:56,347
Obviously, I wasn't gonna leave you here
with your mangled boyfriend.

9
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,182
Ex-boyfriend.

10
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,559
- Oh.
- Yeah.

11
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:02,437
Any news?

12
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:04,814
No, he's still out.

13
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:10,195
You were saying "sirens" in your sleep.

14
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:12,404
- I was?
- Mmm.

15
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,406
Hmm.

16
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,576
Should I get you an edible arrangement?

17
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:24,083
I'm really sorry, Devon.

18
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,168
It's fine. I was fucking with you.

19
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:27,419
No, it's not fine.

20
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,214
I know what "sirens" means.
I should have answered you.

21
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:31,381
You were busy.

22
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:34,259
And all that stuff
I said to you last night too.

23
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,762
I am really...

24
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,307
really sorry.

25
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:44,104
I don't know what's wrong with me.

26
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,315
Well, you're a bitch, so...

27
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,368
What you said
is stuff I needed to hear, so...

28
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:02,622
you did me a favor.

29
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:07,710
What was wrong...

30
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:12,132
when you texted me all those times?

31
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,676
You really wanna know?

32
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:17,470
Yeah.

33
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:23,518
Um...

34
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,981
The day of Dad's appointment,
when he was diagnosed,

35
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:32,068
um, he couldn't sleep,
but he couldn't remember...

36
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:38,490
...why he couldn't sleep,
so he kept waking me up all night

37
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:43,580
asking me, um, "What did the doctor say?
Where are my medications?"

38
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,707
"What's gonna happen to me now?"

39
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:47,208
Like...

40
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:51,629
It's, like, every half-hour,

41
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,505
"What did the doctor say, Devon?"

42
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,883
"Where are my medications?
What's gonna happen to me now?"

43
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:59,137
And his face was so, like, dumb and...

44
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,724
lost and scared,
and I just lost my fucking shit

45
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,393
and I just screamed
at the top of my lungs,

46
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,104
"Fuck you. Go back to fucking bed."

47
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,484
And I was really scared
I was gonna hurt him.

48
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:25,205
But he woke me up a half-hour later
and asked me the same questions.

49
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,374
- You have to get out of that house, Devon.
- I know.

50
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,835
No, but you really do. You've gotta go.

51
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,420
What's he gonna do without me?

52
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:35,047
He's a vet. He has benefits.

53
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:38,218
I have a new job. I'll kick in
if it helps you get out of there.

54
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,095
What's the new job?

55
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,432
Um, well, Kiki promoted me.

56
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:49,187
I'm gonna run the foundation in New York.
It's a huge pay bump, free apartment.

57
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,564
Oh, look at you.

58
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:55,818
Sorry, that sounded mean. I... I...

59
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:59,030
Hey, I meant it.

60
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:01,282
Look at you.

61
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,078
I'm proud of you, Simone.

62
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,999
Why don't you come stay with me
in the city for a while?

63
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,751
Yeah.

64
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:13,877
And do what?

65
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:15,462
Okay, what about Palm Beach then?

66
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:18,507
Morgan told me he invited you.
I think it's a fabulous idea.

67
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,550
Yeah, well, he's a pretty sailor, but no.

68
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:23,930
Perfect gateway drug.
Go away for a month, stay forever.

69
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:29,310
I can't sail away on a yacht, Simone.
I don't even have health insurance.

70
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,398
Well, what do you wanna do?

71
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,191
What do <i>you</i> want?

72
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,527
Don't ask me shit like that.
You sound like Ryan Gosling.

73
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:42,115
I think that you wanna go.
I think you wanna say, "Yes, Morgan."

74
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,409
Go on, try it.

75
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,413
Yes, Morgan.

76
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,081
And,

77
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,542
"Bye, Bruce."

78
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,879
Bye, Bruce.

79
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,052
Your life

80
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,763
is about to get amazing.

81
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,061
Come here.

82
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,114
- Shoes?
- Yes.

83
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,658
- Sunglasses too?
- Sunglasses too.

84
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:27,743
What about her gala dress?

85
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,078
That should go back to Caroline.
Everything else should go.

86
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,372
Good morning, Mrs. Kell.
I have your smoothie here.

87
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,459
Thank you, Patrice.

88
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:39,129
Today, we have a black cherry cold press
with sea kelp and tarragon.

89
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,047
What?

90
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,466
Your smoothie.
It's a black cherry cold press with--

91
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:43,843
Oh God, no, not today.

92
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,679
Not today.

93
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,313
What do you mean, all boxed up?

94
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,316
I don't know.
All her stuff's in boxes up there.

95
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,319
Wow. Hey, what about Missy?
You talk to her? Do you know what's up?

96
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,198
Yeah, she just said that Mrs. K told her
to... to box the stuff up. No further deets.

97
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,784
I don't know, maybe they're packing
for New York or something?

98
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,161
Packing for New York in cardboard boxes?

99
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,955
Michaela would rather die.

100
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,168
"Breaking news."

101
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:21,713
"Mrs. K said to label
the boxes for Goodwill."

102
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,132
"Her stuff is getting donated."

103
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,176
Simone must be getting fired.

104
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:28,136
Are you kidding me?

105
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,764
Holy shit.

106
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:31,807
- We did it.
- I'm going to start crying.

107
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,850
The reign of terror is over.

108
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:36,311
Thank you, Lord Jesus.
You're good. You're a merciful God.

109
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:38,605
Bring it in, man. Oh my God.

110
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,732
I'm gonna spread this news wide.

111
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,401
Yes. Zeus.

112
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,028
Play Jose's Celebration Mix.

113
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:46,113
Oh, yes, Zeus.

114
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,324
- Uh-huh.
- <i>Playing Jose's Celebration Mix.</i>

115
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:52,328
Okay. Come on, man.

116
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,164
Whoo!

117
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,749
Let's go!

118
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,669
Yes!

119
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,844
Come on, now. You got it.

120
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,472
<i>Come on, shake your body, baby
Do the conga</i>

121
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:14,100
So, he's never gonna dance again?

122
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,394
- Yeah.
- Reinforcements have arrived.

123
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,438
- We brought coffee.
- Ooh, gimme, gimme.

124
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,066
And Portuguese fruit tarts
from the local bakery. Don't tell Patrice.

125
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:24,609
- Thanks, Peter.
- Mmm.

126
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,611
- Yeah, thanks, Big Cheese.
- Mm-hmm.

127
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,864
So, any word from the patient?

128
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:32,826
Yes, uh, he's awake, but groggy.

129
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:37,330
He's got, uh, two broken legs,
a broken arm,

130
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:40,208
a couple broken ribs, and a concussion.

131
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,126
Wow.

132
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,672
Yeah. Um, they said
that we could see him soon, though.

133
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,175
- Well, I'll wait with you.
- Okay.

134
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,551
You want me
to take you back to the house still?

135
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:52,387
Yeah, I think I should be there
when my dad wakes up.

136
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:53,598
- Are you good?
- Mmm.

137
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:56,892
I know you two have lots to discuss,
so this is great.

138
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,103
How subtle. Bye.

139
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,735
- Are they a thing? They're cute.
- Yeah, I'm working on it.

140
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,236
- Oh.
- Yeah, I am.

141
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:09,906
- Island matchmaker, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

142
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:20,123
Well, just to continue our tradition
of me being completely awkward

143
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,249
whenever I see you. I--

144
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,919
Oh, no. We don't have to talk about it.

145
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,087
I didn't know about your dad, okay?

146
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:28,215
The history there, the foster care.

147
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,050
Morgan told me, and had I known,

148
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:34,471
I never would have welcomed him
into our home, into your home. I'm sorry.

149
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,348
Please, no more apologies.

150
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:41,687
From what I gather,
his neglect of you was... unspeakable.

151
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:44,565
Yet everyone is talking about it.

152
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,193
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- There you go again.

153
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,946
- Yeah, I'm-- Damn.
- No more.

154
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:52,490
Hmm.

155
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,500
Let me know
if you need anything today, okay?

156
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:04,502
I'm around.

157
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,004
- Question.
- Yes.

158
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,550
Do you know you said "question"?

159
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,843
Mmm. Mm-hmm.

160
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,555
Hold, please.

161
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,855
Morgan, what time are you leaving
for Palm Beach tomorrow?

162
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:26,440
Daybreak.

163
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:28,733
Dramatic.

164
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,570
And I'm, uh...

165
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,071
still invited?

166
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,198
Yes.

167
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,325
Why? Do you want to come?

168
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,036
Yeah, I do.

169
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,497
- I mean, unless there's--
- No, no, no, please. I...

170
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:44,291
- Unless--
- I'd love your company.

171
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,585
- Yeah.
- Okay.

172
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,296
Um... Cool.

173
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:53,091
So, daybreak, is that--
Is there a specific time?

174
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,594
Or should I just, like, sense it
like a rooster?

175
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:59,015
Why don't you just come over after
the gala and spend the night with me?

176
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:02,685
- Sounds good.
- Okay.

177
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,020
Okay.

178
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,313
See you later.

179
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,398
Okay, bye.

180
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,824
Hey, Dad.

181
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,285
I'm home from the hospital.

182
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:20,911
Dad?

183
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:23,539
Dad?

184
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,209
Ray?

185
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,624
Dad!

186
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,251
What are you doing?

187
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:11,962
Dad!

188
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:14,924
Dad!

189
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,343
Dad. Hey.

190
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,388
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Dad.

191
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:21,764
Hey.

192
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:24,308
What are you doing out here all alone?

193
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:25,893
I wasn't alone.

194
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:28,729
Your mom was here.

195
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:36,320
Okay.

196
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,156
Let's get back from the edge.

197
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,033
Come on. It's okay.

198
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,369
It's okay.

199
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:52,336
Hey, buddy.

200
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:54,547
Can you hear me?

201
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,675
Okay.

202
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,344
Okay, take it... take it easy.

203
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,514
You're in the hospital.
You've had quite a fall.

204
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,018
Are those... my legs?

205
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,771
Yeah, they're broken,

206
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,065
and your arm too and a couple of ribs.

207
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:18,486
But the doctor says
you're expected to make a full recovery.

208
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,406
You are a very lucky guy.

209
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,033
Nice.

210
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,453
Here, have some water.

211
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,415
Mmm! Mmm!

212
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,166
Ah!

213
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,919
Sippy good.

214
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:37,046
Oh...

215
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:38,549
Hey, I really...

216
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,511
I really appreciate you guys being here.

217
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,391
Oh, not you.

218
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:51,061
No, no, not you. I don't want you here.

219
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:54,189
- Guards! Guards!
- Hey, hey, hey.

220
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,524
- I've been worried about you.
- No, no, no. You pushed me.

221
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:57,985
- What?
- You pushed me.

222
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:02,030
There was a big push, and it was from you.

223
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,823
No, you're confused.

224
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,326
I was falling...

225
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:09,204
and then... and then you were above me,
and you had wings.

226
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,622
You were drunk.

227
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,999
You pushed me, and you watched me fall,
and you laughed.

228
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,210
I was screaming for help,
if that's what you mean.

229
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,420
- You're a witch!
- Okay, let's just slow down.

230
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:21,132
You've had a concussion,
and you're on a lot of pain medication.

231
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,842
- Show him your wings.
- Okay.

232
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:25,261
- Show him who you really are!
- Whoa, whoa. Okay. Oh...

233
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:28,681
Okay, that's... that's quite enough of that,
all right?

234
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:32,393
Look, she doesn't want to marry you, okay?

235
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:33,686
That is her right.

236
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:36,314
I don't understand. She did this.

237
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,818
No, you did this.

238
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,112
Now, you need to find some manners,

239
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,864
or me and you are gonna have an issue.

240
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,450
I'm sorry, Peter.

241
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,452
My body hurts.

242
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:50,913
You're okay.

243
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:52,873
Have your sippy.

244
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,502
Mmm. Mmm.

245
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,504
Mmm.

246
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,257
- Hey, Dad, have you seen Ray?
- Who?

247
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,468
Dad, Ray, my friend Raymond.

248
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:08,013
He's not in the guest house,
and it doesn't look like he slept there.

249
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,307
- You don't know where he is?
- No.

250
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,559
Well, did he not come home last night?

251
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,435
How should I know? He's your boyfriend.

252
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:17,188
Hey, he... That's... He's not my boyfriend.

253
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,648
I made that very clear.

254
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,276
- Fooled me.
- Last night, on the beach.

255
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:22,695
Fuck! Come on.

256
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:26,406
- Now where are we going?
- Come on. We gotta go this way.

257
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,325
- Devon.
- I'm sorry.

258
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,505
Oh no.

259
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,972
Maybe he went swimming?

260
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,354
Who's Allie?

261
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,566
Called like 49 times.

262
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,109
Oh God.

263
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:03,944
His wife.

264
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,698
Maybe he went back to Buffalo?

265
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:12,118
Without his phone and his keys
and his wallet and his pants?

266
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,662
I don't know.

267
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:18,083
The last thing I said to him last night
was that I'd be better off if he drowned.

268
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,378
It's not funny. Do you think that he...

269
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:23,756
That kid? No way.

270
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,924
He doesn't have the nuggets.

271
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:29,093
What if he swam out too far
and he's just treading water somewhere

272
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,471
miles from shore?

273
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,016
Hey, it's Allie.

274
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,267
Dad, no. Dad!

275
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,727
- Hi.
- <i>Hello. Who is this?</i>

276
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:38,686
I'm Bruce.

277
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,772
No, Allie, hey. Hey, girl.

278
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,440
Long time. What's up?

279
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,901
<i>Devon? Why do you have Ray's phone?</i>

280
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,235
Th-- This is Ray's phone?

281
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:47,529
That's, uh... I...

282
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:51,658
No kidding.
I just, uh, found this on the beach.

283
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:52,992
<i>I knew it.</i>

284
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,452
<i>He's with you, isn't he?</i>

285
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,704
I, uh...

286
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,624
You're cutting in and out. Is there...
You're not on the Wi-Fi?

287
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,917
Can't hear you.

288
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,210
<i>Don't lie to me.</i>

289
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,462
<i>You're together.</i>

290
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:07,383
I'm...

291
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,844
I'm really sorry, Allie.

292
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,016
But I really don't know where he is.
I can't...

293
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:18,852
- I can't find him anywhere.
- <i>I know where he is.</i>

294
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,730
<i>He's on an island with a fucking whore.</i>

295
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:10,695
Simone, hello and good morning.

296
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,697
Hey, look, everyone, it's Simone.

297
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,323
Hi, Simone.

298
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:15,242
Um...

299
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,243
What's with you guys?

300
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:18,953
It's just such a beautiful day.

301
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:23,541
Yes, the sun is bright, sky majestic.
Who knows what the day will bring?

302
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:24,543
Maybe glory.

303
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,919
Um...

304
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,880
Okay. Creepy.

305
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,048
Uh, where's Kiki?

306
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,132
Rehearsal.

307
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:35,094
Yeah. I am walking in that direction.
Let's go together, yeah?

308
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,305
- Yeah.
- Good.

309
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:51,694
Here's the updated list for you,
Mrs. Kell, for your approval.

310
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:52,862
Great, thank you.

311
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,072
Both legs?

312
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:57,366
Uh, the femur in one,
but he's gonna be okay.

313
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,701
God! Poor Ethan.

314
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:01,997
- He really should be dead.
- Is he still coming to the gala?

315
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,290
- Oh, hi, Simone.
- Hi, Simone.

316
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:07,043
Hi, ladies.
I'm... I'm so sorry that I'm late.

317
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,545
Uh, where do you want me, Kiki?

318
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,589
Oh, I don't need you for this.
Could you wait for me in your room?

319
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,425
How will I know my blocking?

320
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:17,303
You want me out front
now that I'm technically cabinet, right?

321
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,639
Did you guys hear the good news?

322
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,682
Um...

323
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,975
I'm gonna run the foundation.

324
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,602
- You are?
- Simone, you get it...

325
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,645
Thank you.

326
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,272
Please do as I ask, Simone.

327
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,109
Yeah.

328
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:32,653
- Yeah, okay.
- Thank you.

329
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:39,242
All right, opening position
same as last year.

330
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,619
Peter, um, stop looking so miserable.

331
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,620
I am miserable.

332
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,706
Can you move six inches to the left?

333
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:49,377
I know where to stand.
I've been doing this since I was a child.

334
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,338
All right,
our guests will enter here as always.

335
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:55,633
The reception line is here with the three
of you greeting the guests first.

336
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,301
Shake, shake, shake. Smile, smile, smile.

337
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,886
Peter and I will be there.

338
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:01,306
Yeah, shake, shake, shake.
Smile, smile, smile.

339
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,048
Champagne, champagne, champagne.

340
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:40,011
And then Peter gives his opening remarks.
Do you need a refresh on the lines?

341
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,679
No.

342
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:46,309
And then Peter introduces me,
and I give the annual gala toast.

343
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,685
Clap, clap, clap.

344
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,770
Hey, do we have a pack and play?

345
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,647
- What?
- I just heard.

346
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,566
Sarah and Rory are coming.

347
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,318
They're bringing
their spouses and the baby.

348
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,320
They're asking if we have a pack and play.

349
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,906
- We can get a pack and play, right?
- Of course, sir.

350
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,032
What's a pack and play?

351
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,451
It's a pop-up portable crib that--

352
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,244
Your... Your kids are... Your kids are coming?

353
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,370
- Where?
- Here.

354
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,748
I offered to send them the plane.
I told you last night.

355
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,209
No... No, you didn't.
We're gonna have an infant at the gala?

356
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,168
Not an infant.

357
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:14,670
Our infant.
He can join the receiving line.

358
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,547
It's gonna be like old times.
The whole family.

359
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,383
Do they have black tie
on such short notice?

360
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,551
Uh...

361
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,846
I just told them to wear whatever.

362
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:24,765
Hello, hi.

363
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,933
Yeah.

364
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,144
Yeah, she's... she's very excited.

365
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:30,520
We both are.

366
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,482
Jose, would you come with me
to Simone's room, please?

367
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,109
I would love to.

368
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,874
- It's time to go.
- Kiki, this isn't...

369
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,502
- This is not what it looks like.
- Please leave quietly.

370
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:57,046
No, but this isn't an accurate
representation of what happened.

371
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:59,757
I pushed... I pushed him away. I... I ran.

372
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,133
It doesn't matter.

373
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:04,011
But he... he kissed me.
I was as stunned as you are.

374
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:05,888
No, Simone,
you are not as stunned as I am.

375
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,723
I didn't know I could feel
this level of hurt.

376
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,642
There is nothing going on between us.

377
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:12,645
He made a mistake,
and he immediately owned up to it.

378
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,313
Then why did you hide it from me?

379
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,441
Because I knew
that it would devastate you.

380
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,403
And I... I actually, like...

381
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,699
I live my life not to devastate you.

382
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:26,493
Well...

383
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,330
Kiki, please.

384
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:35,584
Please, I was...
I was following him, like you asked,

385
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:37,169
and... and he saw me.

386
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,046
Like, you know Peter.

387
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:42,133
Like, that's how... that's how you two met.
He came on to you too.

388
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,343
Jocelyn was not my friend.

389
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,471
You are my best friend,
and now you're a threat to my marriage,

390
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:51,018
and you've put everything I have built
at risk, and so now you have to go.

391
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:52,686
Kiki, please.

392
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:58,399
Jose will give you the termination papers
and the updated NDA to sign in the car,

393
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,112
and we will never speak
to anyone about this again.

394
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,406
Kiki, please.

395
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,992
Please, don't do this.

396
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:09,745
Can I have your phone, please?

397
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,586
And the photo?

398
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,593
Kiki, you're killing me.

399
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:30,807
I'm so sorry.

400
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,316
Jose, will you take her?

401
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,352
There's only four hotels
on the entire island.

402
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,561
He's not at any of them.

403
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:20,189
Ow! Watch where you poke, bud.

404
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,899
Sorry, Mr. DeWitt.

405
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,320
He's not at the hospital 'cause
I would've seen him. Where the hell is he?

406
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,698
What do you think of this getup?

407
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,034
Oh, Dad.

408
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,745
- Hmm?
- You look wonderful.

409
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,914
- It's not wearing me?
- No.

410
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,834
You are wearing it. Very dapper.

411
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:42,086
Do you want to see
some cummerbund and tie options?

412
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,089
Yeah, let's see those. Thanks, Kenny.

413
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,844
What time does this thing start today?

414
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:52,305
Um, pre-gala drinks start at 5.

415
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,348
When do we go home?

416
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:56,267
Tomorrow is the plan.

417
00:23:56,268 --> 00:24:00,187
Um, but I... have something
I want to run by you.

418
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:02,606
- Uh-oh.
- No, it's a good thing, I think.

419
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:06,819
Uh, I... I met this guy
on the island, and, um--

420
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,405
You and your men all the time.

421
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,282
Rude.

422
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:13,743
- Can I continue?
- Mm-hmm.

423
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:17,164
His name's Morgan, and he's, uh,

424
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:21,960
the captain of this big ship,
and he invited me on a trip with him.

425
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:23,461
Sailor, huh?

426
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,422
Yeah, the trip takes, like, a month.

427
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:27,048
A month?

428
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:32,761
- Never mind.
- Wait a sec.

429
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:34,054
No, it's a stupid idea.

430
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:35,223
Do you like this guy?

431
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,604
- I can't leave you alone for that long.
- Sure, you can.

432
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:43,814
- Pfft.
- Who's gonna give you your medication?

433
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,024
The VA.

434
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:48,236
They'll mail it to the house.
I just gotta fill out some forms.

435
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:52,031
You won't go outside.
You'll just drink too much and smoke.

436
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:56,536
Hey, the way I spend my remaining years
is up to me, so fuck off.

437
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:58,955
You should go.

438
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:03,585
Your sister, she's got these rich dicks
lapping out of her hand.

439
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,089
You don't owe me shit.

440
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,799
Okay, Mr. DeWitt.

441
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,134
Pick your poison.

442
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:13,220
Hmm.

443
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:19,434
Excellent choice.

444
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,479
Let me see about a pocket square now.

445
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:31,404
You mean it?

446
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,782
- You'd be okay for a month?
- It's no big deal.

447
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:35,741
Pfft!

448
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:36,785
I'll be fine.

449
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,829
Yeah, I mean, it's just a month, right?

450
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:41,957
Exactly.

451
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,504
I love you, Simone.

452
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:51,466
Dad.

453
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,719
I'm Devon.

454
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:05,647
Are you okay?

455
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:10,944
I know we were talking
about something important

456
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,030
that really matters to you.

457
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,494
But I...

458
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:23,582
It's okay.

459
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:26,250
- It's okay.
- I'm so sorry.

460
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,503
It's okay. It's okay.

461
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:37,762
I'm in hell.

462
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,270
Oh, Missy, hey.

463
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:49,399
What's going on?

464
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:51,359
I'm here to help you pack.

465
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:02,620
Okay. Let us get this show on the road.

466
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:05,915
You want to listen
to some tunes, huh? While we drive?

467
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:07,667
Simone?

468
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:15,592
You okay back there, Simone?

469
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:22,098
Okay.

470
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,741
Dad, I told you to change.

471
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,285
I choose to wear this.

472
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:45,996
Okay. Hey, what the fuck's going on?
Why are we getting kicked out?

473
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:50,125
Uh, I'm afraid your sister was let go,
so I'm here to take you to the ferry.

474
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:51,169
What?

475
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:54,089
- What do you mean? She got fired?
- Yeah.

476
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:56,508
Simone.

477
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,426
Simone, what happened?

478
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,055
Simone.

479
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:08,520
- What did you do to her?
- Me? I... Nothing. I...

480
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,312
She must just be in shock.

481
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:12,523
Well, yeah,
that job was her entire personality.

482
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,525
- Why did she get fired?
- Something about a theft.

483
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:15,652
Theft?

484
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:20,739
Simone wouldn't steal a gumball.
She's never been in trouble in her life.

485
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,409
Fuck, it's the police. Hello?

486
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,661
Uh, are we going to the gala?

487
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,246
So, um...

488
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:28,164
No.

489
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,207
Sorry. Uh...

490
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:33,962
Unfortunately, no. But you know what?
It wasn't even going to be fun anyway, so...

491
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:37,674
So, I'm not going to meet Jim Kelly?

492
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:44,847
Come on, Devon.

493
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:48,017
I'm coming! No, not you. I'm coming.
We'll be right there. Fuck.

494
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:49,436
Bye.

495
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,190
Good news. Ray's alive.

496
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,442
Bad news. He's in the drunk tank.

497
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:59,237
Can we make a pit stop
at the police station on the way out?

498
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:02,282
You Buffalo people know how to party.

499
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,371
Oh, very nice, sir.

500
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:11,457
Thank you, Patrice. Have you seen Jose?

501
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:14,460
Uh, no, I believe
he's running some errands for Mrs. Kell.

502
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:16,545
- Is there something I can help you with?
- Uh...

503
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:19,673
I was going to have him collect
Rory and Sarah from the airport.

504
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:22,760
- Did I tell you that they're coming?
- Yes. It's so exciting.

505
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,679
You want me to have, uh,
maybe Carl or Eddy pick them up?

506
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,433
No, that's okay.
I'll just have Simone book a car.

507
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,685
Simone's not up there, sir.

508
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,062
Mrs. Kell let her go this morning.

509
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:35,398
She what?

510
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:49,953
You fired Simone?

511
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:52,165
Ah, yes, I did. So?

512
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,667
So I'm surprised. Why?

513
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:56,711
I don't trust her.

514
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:03,509
Didn't you just decide
to promote her yesterday?

515
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:06,595
She works for me, so it's my decision,

516
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,222
and it's my business.

517
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,724
Okay, but I'm surprised
we didn't talk about this.

518
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:12,100
What is there to talk about?

519
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:13,769
You two are close. You're like sisters.

520
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:18,065
And it seems especially cold to fire her

521
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:21,235
moments after we hear
about her hellacious childhood,

522
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:24,447
and her father is here,
and Ethan falls off a cliff.

523
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,282
It's a little monstrous, actually.

524
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:30,328
She stole my earrings.
I caught her red-handed.

525
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:32,956
What earrings?

526
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,374
These.

527
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,547
You lend her your jewelry all the time.

528
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,298
You dress her up like a doll.

529
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:45,551
It makes no sense
that she would steal those.

530
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:48,512
Well, I don't know why
she did what she did,

531
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:52,140
but she was disrespecting my property
and taking what was mine,

532
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:54,977
and I won't have it. So we're done.

533
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:56,812
Okay, so that's it. She's just gone.

534
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,982
You seem awfully concerned
about this girl.

535
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:04,444
Well, I... I think she's got a good heart.

536
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:05,737
She has a wonderful heart.

537
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:08,950
And the truth is I love her,
but I don't get to have her, do I, Pete?

538
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,413
We don't always get to have what we love.

539
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:36,311
Miss DeWitt. Come on in.

540
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,982
Thank God. Get me out of here.

541
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:44,151
Oh my God, Lily, is that you? Lily!

542
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:46,945
Kevin! Oh my God.

543
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:48,322
I have missed you, mama.

544
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:51,867
I tried to find you on Instagram,
but I lost my phone in the bath.

545
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:54,286
How's the cult rescue going?
I've been worried sick.

546
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:57,665
- So good. What are you doing here?
- I don't know.

547
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,792
I'm just trying
to make this stallion my steed.

548
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:02,502
- Don't breathe on me.
- I'm not.

549
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:03,921
Could you not?

550
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:08,300
This absolute king washed up
at the wedding I was at last night.

551
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:10,719
He walked out of the water
completely naked

552
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,679
like Daryl Hannah in <i>Splash</i>.

553
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,933
Fortunately, we have clothes
in the lost and found for the drunks.

554
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,727
I told you I was not drunk.
I had hypothermia.

555
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:20,813
- I have hypothyroid.
- Oh God.

556
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:25,275
I had the most traumatic experience
of my life last night.

557
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,610
Oh, this story again.

558
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,320
I'll get his release paperwork.

559
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:30,572
- I got caught in a riptide.
- Thank you.

560
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:32,532
One minute, I'm in the shallow water.

561
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:36,703
Then the next, I'm a mile from shore
in this crazy current,

562
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:40,248
and I'm just getting pounded
and pounded on the rocks.

563
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:41,750
I thought I was gonna die.

564
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:43,961
That's very dramatic.
I'm glad you're okay.

565
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,631
And then I had an epiphany.

566
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,051
The dark current is you.

567
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:52,177
You.

568
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:54,137
You have this crazy pull over me.

569
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:56,516
What am I even doing
on this island, Devon?

570
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,267
I almost made my wife a widow last night,

571
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:01,979
nearly left my son fatherless
because of you.

572
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,523
No. No, Ray.
I didn't invite you to this island.

573
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:07,776
You chose to be here.
You chose to go swimming naked.

574
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:09,987
No. You did this to me.

575
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,071
You did this.

576
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:13,240
- Do you want me to slap him?
- I wanna go home.

577
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:16,119
I wanna be with Allie and Mason.
That's what my life is about.

578
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,204
I want to go home.

579
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:21,624
I gotta tell you something, Ray.

580
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:26,169
Yeah, well, I'm sorry.
I thought you were fucking dead.

581
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,046
Why would you answer a dead man's phone?

582
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:29,506
She called, like, 14 times.

583
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,509
It doesn't matter
how many times she called.

584
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:34,469
Stop kicking my bucket, you animal.

585
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,804
- Jose, would you mind?
- Yep.

586
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:39,141
- We've been doing this for 30 years.
- Who walks into the ocean naked?

587
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,309
You told me to.

588
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:53,156
Can you hear me, Simone?

589
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:03,291
No?

590
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,796
I don't even remember why we're here.

591
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:16,386
I forget all the things
that I want to remember

592
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:19,515
and remember all the things
I want to forget.

593
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:26,147
Like the face of the police officer
when she came to take you away.

594
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:29,441
And the way that she said,

595
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:32,195
"Did you forget
there was a child in here?"

596
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,450
I didn't feed you.

597
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:40,703
I left you all alone
in your room for so long.

598
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,038
Uh...

599
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,708
I shut the door when you called out to me.

600
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,338
I'm sorry, Simone.

601
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,218
I'm sorry.

602
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:57,261
Hey.

603
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,264
Devon is going away,

604
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,559
and it's gonna be you and me again.

605
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:07,730
And... I will do better this time.

606
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,736
Simone.

607
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,031
Simone.

608
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:27,083
Perfect timing to choose right now
to be honest with everyone in our life.

609
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:30,670
Bye, Kevin. I'll see you soon.

610
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:33,214
Bye, Lil. Until next time.

611
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,803
Where's Simone?

612
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:02,923
Hi.

613
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,258
Hi.

614
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:15,019
I was just thinking about you.

615
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:16,519
Huh.

616
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,773
I'm sorry that you got fired.

617
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:22,360
I know it's my fault,
and I'm gonna fix it.

618
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:25,321
I don't want to work here anymore anyway.

619
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:29,408
But, um...

620
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:33,704
before I go, I need to tell you something.

621
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,132
Yes, Peter, talk to me.

622
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,675
<i>Where are you right now?</i>

623
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:49,720
I'm driving in my car. Why, what's up?

624
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,262
<i>Are you alone?</i>

625
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:53,890
Uh, no, no, I'm with Bruce and, uh, Devon

626
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:57,853
and you know, the... the nurse.
Why, what's up? You need something?

627
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,898
<i>Yeah. Can you take me off speaker?</i>

628
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:03,109
Okay, hang on. Hang on, hang on.

629
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:12,368
Talk to me.

630
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,245
Yeah.

631
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,414
Yeah, sure, of course. Okay.

632
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,916
Yeah, yeah. Copy that.

633
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,877
Sorry, guys, it's a change of plans.
I... I have to head back.

634
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:23,920
No, wait, wait, wait.

635
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,131
- I'm gonna get out. I'll get myself home.
- Okay.

636
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:28,008
What, uh... Hey, are you sure?

637
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:30,845
Later, D.

638
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,430
Be careful.

639
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,781
- Hi.
- Hi, Michaela.

640
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:52,824
Have you seen Peter?

641
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:55,578
- No, Mrs. Kell. Champagne?
- No. Will you go find him?

642
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:13,636
Okay, I need you
to stay in the car, please.

643
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:16,056
Do not get out. I will be right back.

644
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:18,851
Mmm.

645
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:23,355
Dad, stay where you are.
I'm gonna go look for Simone.

646
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,079
Fuck.

647
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:38,722
Surprise.

648
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:42,101
We, uh... We still on for tonight?

649
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:46,479
- Listen, I--
- Oh no.

650
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,232
I really want to come. I do.

651
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:50,276
I can't.

652
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:53,112
Man, I was really excited.

653
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:55,239
Next time.

654
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,742
And, um, thank you...

655
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,329
for being so sweet to me.

656
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:06,333
I just bought all this fresh fruit,
and I was gonna make you crepes.

657
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,168
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

658
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:17,011
Would you excuse me for just a moment?

659
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:21,764
- What are you doing here?
- Where's Simone? Is she here?

660
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:24,225
No, I thought she'd be
on the ferry with you by now.

661
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:26,352
- Shit, we lost her.
- She isn't with Jose?

662
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:27,438
No, she took off.

663
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:31,316
By the way,
you got some big nerve firing her.

664
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:33,901
- Um, would you find Peter for me, please?
- Of course.

665
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:36,487
You know, Simone doesn't even take
free samples at Trader Joe's.

666
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:39,198
She works her ass off
for everything she has.

667
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:41,242
And she is devastated right now

668
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:44,287
because she worships
the ground you walk on, you stupid bitch.

669
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:47,915
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- You prance around here saving birds,

670
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:50,960
telling my sister that she belongs here
and that you're her friend,

671
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:53,463
and then you rip it away for what,
because you felt like it?

672
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:56,341
- Could you keep your voice down?
- Oh, you want me to keep my voice down?

673
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:58,092
Will you ping Jose for me? Thank you.

674
00:43:58,093 --> 00:44:01,054
I've had your number
since day fucking one.

675
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:04,474
That's right. Me. I have.
You know what you are?

676
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:10,230
You're a megalomaniac,
cult leader, slut, whore, and a murderer.

677
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:14,234
Yeah, that's right. We all know
what you did to Jocelyn, babe.

678
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:20,323
Jocelyn Kell lives
on an island off Washington state.

679
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:23,619
She's a recluse who hasn't been seen
in public for over ten years

680
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:28,957
because she was disfigured
by plastic surgery after the divorce.

681
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:32,001
An injection hit an artery
causing necrosis,

682
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:35,089
which means that half of her face
is dead flesh, and she's blind in one eye.

683
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:39,050
It's very sad.
She's in agony most of the time,

684
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:42,721
and we try to respect her privacy
by not speaking about her publicly.

685
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:45,265
Oh.

686
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,518
Is there anything else
you'd like to air out

687
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:51,188
in front of our friends
before Jose sees you out?

688
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,899
- No, that's it.
- Thank you.

689
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:56,610
Jose will see you out.

690
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,864
- Where is Jose?
- Okay, I'll see myself out.

691
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:04,992
It's done.

692
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:07,996
- Good work. Thank you, my friend.
- Of course.

693
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:09,415
Pedro.

694
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,545
Are you sure you want to do this again?

695
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:16,380
I'm sure.

696
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:19,007
It might get messy, you know.

697
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:21,427
That's why I have you.

698
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:24,763
Yeah.

699
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,895
<i>Ay, Dios.</i>

700
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:35,022
On Instagram,
he can't stop saying "bacon pancakes."

701
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:36,733
- No. No.
- He says it all the time.

702
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,818
That's astonishing.
You would never think--

703
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,528
- Michaela.
- Uh... Oh.

704
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:43,322
- I need to talk to you.
- But I'm... I'm in the middle of something.

705
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:44,533
Right now, please.

706
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:47,244
Please excuse me. I'll be right back.

707
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:54,251
Can you give us the room, please, folks?
Thank you very much.

708
00:45:56,879 --> 00:46:00,173
What is it? Wh-- What's so important
that we need to speak about it now?

709
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:01,258
I'm not happy.

710
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:05,304
I don't think
I've ever been happy in this marriage.

711
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,556
Is this about my reaction
to your kids coming?

712
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:12,018
Because I admit, I was surprised,
but I'm... I'm excited now.

713
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:13,686
I'm... I'm excited to see them.

714
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:16,647
You have systematically discouraged me

715
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:21,527
from knowing my own children
for over a decade.

716
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:24,572
- As much as I have tried to convince--
- Oh my God, this again?

717
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:26,950
You ruined your relationship
with your children.

718
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:29,243
You pursued me.

719
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:32,789
You left Jocelyn.
You let them demonize me.

720
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,499
I'm letting you go, Kiki.

721
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,752
What are you even talking about?
We're in the middle of the gala.

722
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:40,838
I'm sorry if this is abrupt,

723
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:43,634
but now that I've seen it,
I cannot unsee it.

724
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:45,218
See what?

725
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:49,097
You were gonna spend the rest of the day,
the rest of our lives,

726
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:53,644
with incriminating photos of me
hidden in a safe.

727
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:56,687
Simone told you.

728
00:46:56,688 --> 00:47:00,691
Yes. Simone cared enough
about me to warn me.

729
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:01,651
Yes.

730
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:04,111
And now those photos have been destroyed.

731
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:06,322
I wasn't going to do anything with them.
They were just...

732
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:07,865
It was just an insurance policy.

733
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:10,993
Good marriages don't need
an insurance policy.

734
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:11,911
Ours does.

735
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:13,830
You and your lawyers made sure of that.

736
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,081
I gave up my career for you,

737
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:18,669
and you gave me a prenup
that only values my fucking ovaries!

738
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:23,339
The aviary is mine. I want it.

739
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:26,260
No one knows how
to take care of those birds but me.

740
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:29,388
Simone knows.

741
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:34,726
Don't be the fool
that fucks the assistant.

742
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:38,564
It's not about Simone.

743
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:41,066
It's about me

744
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:44,819
wanting love and light in my life.

745
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:48,865
About me needing to feel like my journey

746
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:52,995
on this planet has been rich
and worthwhile

747
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:56,331
and... and full of goodness.

748
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:58,541
You're a walking cliché.

749
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:01,627
I want my kids, my grandkids,

750
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:03,170
running around in here.

751
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:07,593
I may even decide to have
another baby of my own. Who knows?

752
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:10,804
Having a baby
won't make you any younger, Pete.

753
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:14,433
Hmm.

754
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:17,686
Yeah, I think, uh,

755
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:21,773
we should let our lawyers
handle the rest of this conversation.

756
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:23,692
Jose?

757
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,112
Oh, I...

758
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:30,323
Um, no, I can...

759
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,701
I can see myself out. That's...

760
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:45,547
Don't you look beautiful
in that dress I had made for you?

761
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:48,800
Hey hey.

762
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:04,483
You really do look lovely.

763
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:07,527
I'd like to second that, Miss DeWitt.

764
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:09,196
Very striking,

765
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:11,406
<i>mi amor.</i>

766
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:16,536
Thank you, Jose.

767
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:18,830
Excuse me.

768
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,803
You okay?

769
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:35,305
Are you?

770
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:37,391
Yeah.

771
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:07,421
Hey.

772
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:10,549
Hey, where's...

773
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:12,759
where's your dress?

774
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:14,469
What are you doing?

775
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:16,096
What do you mean?

776
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:18,973
You're with Peter now?

777
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:21,934
Oh, yeah, it, like...
it, like, just happened.

778
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:26,230
Um, look, my hands are still shaking.
We found each other on the beach.

779
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:27,732
Oh God, like magnets.

780
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:30,151
We had this whole conversation,
and then at the end,

781
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:32,404
I was like, "Okay, bye,"

782
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:36,949
and then he was like...
"Wait, I need to tell you something."

783
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:38,660
"I think I'm in love with you."

784
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:42,164
- And then once he said it, I--
- What about Michaela?

785
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:44,791
What about Michaela?

786
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,588
If it doesn't serve you,

787
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:51,631
let it go.

788
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:55,677
Wow.

789
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,262
Okay.

790
00:50:58,263 --> 00:51:00,140
"Wow, okay."

791
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:05,020
What, why are you saying it like... judgy?

792
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:07,563
You took her husband.

793
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:09,523
He came on to me.
I didn't initiate any of this.

794
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:12,193
What, am I not supposed to walk
through a door that opens?

795
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:14,236
Yeah. Okay, good luck with that door.

796
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:16,490
Devon, wait. Come on.

797
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:19,700
This day has been a total win.

798
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:22,495
I'm not getting fired.
You're not going home with Dad.

799
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:23,496
Morgan is here.

800
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:26,248
He's looking smoking hot in a tux.

801
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:29,168
Like, do you have any idea
how fun this night's gonna be?

802
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:30,921
Yeah, no, I do.

803
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:35,133
I know how fun this night will be.
I'm gonna go home with Dad.

804
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:39,679
- Devon, come on.
- I want to go home and take care of Dad.

805
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:43,975
Dropping out of college
to take care of you

806
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:47,395
is the best thing I've ever done.

807
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:52,025
I don't think you understand
how proud I am of myself

808
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,152
that I did that.

809
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:57,864
You didn't serve me,

810
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:00,659
and I didn't let you go.

811
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:07,040
But now I have to.

812
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:11,920
Why do you sound so dramatic? It's...

813
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:13,839
It's not like...

814
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:21,388
You know?
It's not like I'm not gonna see you.

815
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:28,978
This fall, in the city, you know?

816
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:32,566
I'll fly you in, and we can get pedicures.

817
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:35,818
- See a show. Okay.
- Yeah, that sounds good.

818
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:36,736
Yeah.

819
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:42,284
Okay.

820
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:47,706
I've gotta go. This is like...

821
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:50,500
- Well, it's like a whole thing, but, um...
- Mm-hmm.

822
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:52,711
I love you.

823
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:56,089
You know?

824
00:52:58,717 --> 00:52:59,801
I love you too.

825
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:12,022
Bye.

826
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:35,754
Let's come together.

827
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:37,923
And we will begin

828
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:40,967
as we used to begin

829
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:43,428
with my toast.

830
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:47,265
Here's... to all of you.

831
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:25,095
Don't know how good it is.

832
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:27,973
Two creams, two sugars.

833
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:30,016
Mmm.

834
00:54:33,728 --> 00:54:34,937
- Nice.
- I remembered.

835
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:36,856
Yeah. Good job.

836
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:41,778
You're a good girl.

837
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:45,615
Thanks, Dad.

838
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:51,204
I'll remember you.

839
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:04,342
<i>Last call for boarding.</i>

840
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:06,678
<i>Last call for boarding.</i>

841
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:16,730
Hey, Dad. Don't go anywhere, okay?
I'll be right back.

842
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:49,095
Mind if I join you?

843
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:02,692
I saw you get on the boat,
and I wanted to come say something.

844
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:07,655
I don't know what exactly.

845
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:13,620
Sorry.

846
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:16,039
I guess.

847
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:17,540
Sorry for what?

848
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:19,709
Oh.

849
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:22,170
Murder allegations and...

850
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:25,464
cult accusations.

851
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:27,592
You know? Some light theft.

852
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:30,804
Some toiletries
and a couple gold necklaces.

853
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:32,847
Hmm.

854
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:37,685
Apology accepted.

855
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,736
What are you gonna do now?

856
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:49,322
Oh God, I have no idea.

857
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:51,324
What about you?

858
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:54,369
Buffalo with my dad.

859
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:57,622
But I think I'm gonna get my own place.

860
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:00,834
You know, like a grown-up.

861
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:02,919
Somewhere with light.

862
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:08,883
You should cash that check I gave you.

863
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:10,801
Oh.

864
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:14,430
No. I mean, that wouldn't be right.
It's $10,000.

865
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:16,307
Freebies are rare in this world.

866
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:19,227
Cash it quick before it bounces.

867
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:23,273
Okay.

868
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:27,152
- Thanks, Michaela.
- Hey hey.

869
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:32,322
What is "hey hey," by the way?

870
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:33,907
Oh, it's nothing.

871
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:37,036
Just something that I... I say,
and it became a thing.

872
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:41,123
People will do anything for you
when you're Mrs. Kell.

873
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:42,959
You just tell them what the rules are.

874
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:48,338
You think my sister's
gonna be okay with him?

875
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:49,257
No.

876
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:53,051
Well, who knows? You know?

877
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:55,846
I'm sure Jocelyn thought
the same thing about me,

878
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:57,473
but I had a pretty good run.

879
00:57:57,474 --> 00:58:00,602
Took him 13 years
to decide that I was a monster.

880
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,315
You're not a monster, Michaela.

881
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:15,116
Neither is she.
