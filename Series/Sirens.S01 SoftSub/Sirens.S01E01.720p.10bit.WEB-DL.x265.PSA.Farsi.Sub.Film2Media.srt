1
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:47,047
Okay, Barnaby.

2
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:49,382
Okay, sweet boy,

3
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:51,593
it's time to go.

4
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:54,721
I love you.

5
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,059
Go ahead.

6
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,353
<i>Hi, you've reached Simone.</i>

7
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,564
<i>I can't get to the phone right now
but leave a message...</i>

8
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:24,769
Jesus.

9
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:29,231
- <i>They had just over...</i>
- Ow! Son of a bitch!

10
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:33,153
<i>...face the most formidable enemy
the United States had ever encountered.</i>

11
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,989
<i>- For the first time, American troops...</i>
- Dad.

12
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,367
<i>...would go head-to-head
with Hitler's entrenched defenses.</i>

13
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:43,162
You're just getting in?
I didn't hear the car.

14
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:46,540
Yeah, I had... a rough night.
It's impounded.

15
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,875
Again?

16
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:50,419
Jesus, could your movie be any louder?

17
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,587
Leave it.

18
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,464
I like it. It's good company.

19
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:58,218
What's that?

20
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:00,638
It's an edible arrangement.
I found it on the stoop.

21
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,308
A what?

22
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,143
It's, um...

23
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,688
a flower arrangement made out of fruit.
You're supposed to eat it.

24
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,691
Who the hell would send us that?

25
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:18,823
Oh, Simone.

26
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,701
Why would she send us fruit?

27
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,413
Because she is a self-centered,

28
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,080
gutter-rat whore.

29
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:29,125
Don't talk about your sister like that.

30
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,252
She was nice to send this.

31
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,045
Ooh, a strawberry.

32
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,380
Fuck this.

33
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,466
Dad...

34
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:39,510
...there's beer and Stouffer's pizza
in the kitchen.

35
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,471
I'll be back.

36
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,847
Where are you going?

37
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:44,933
- Devon!
- Bitch.

38
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:14,837
Bitch.

39
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:57,964
Hey.

40
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,841
Ethan.

41
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:02,719
I have to go.

42
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:04,386
I'm late for work.

43
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:07,222
- Mmm. No, no. Simone. Wait. No.
- No, I have to go.

44
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:09,851
- Wait, Simone. Stay.
- There's too much to do.

45
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:11,310
I can't be late.

46
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,811
No, wait, hold on a second.

47
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,690
I just had
the craziest, most amazing idea.

48
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,194
Why don't you just tell Michaela
that we're dating?

49
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,782
- That's really funny.
- It's not like she's gonna care.

50
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,701
What do you mean?
She's definitely gonna care.

51
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:31,204
She's my boss,
and she said I cannot date anyone here.

52
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:33,583
Yeah, but th... that's cuckoo bananas.

53
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,836
Our summer fling is about to end anyway.

54
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,253
Ouch.

55
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:40,715
Well, I mean, like, logistically.

56
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:42,841
Practically.

57
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:47,388
Labor Day is on Monday,
so all summer romances are

58
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:49,473
categorically over.

59
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,475
Keep talking logistics to me.

60
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,060
It's so hot.

61
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,688
Okay, but I... I really have to go, so...

62
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,107
- I'll see you later. Okay, my love?
- Mmm. Mmm.

63
00:05:58,733 --> 00:05:59,900
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

64
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,234
Uh--

65
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:03,278
Did you just call me your "love"?

66
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,821
I'm rushing. I didn't, um...

67
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:07,699
Doesn't sound very categorically over.

68
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,909
- What?
- I'm gonna go.

69
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,327
- Just wait, wait...
- Okay, bye.

70
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,120
Wait. Come here.

71
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,539
- Okay. Okay.
- Come here.

72
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:22,131
You can be a little bit late.

73
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,467
- Mmm, yeah.
- Yeah.

74
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,303
Yeah, you're gonna stay.

75
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:55,706
Oh my God.

76
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:03,673
What's up, pink pants? You got a problem?

77
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,268
Kids.

78
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,064
Can't smoke out here, miss.

79
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:22,899
I can't hear you.

80
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,195
No smoking on board.
You light that, you will be fined.

81
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,701
Well, it's a two-hour ride,

82
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,453
Paul.

83
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:35,955
I gotta put something in my mouth.

84
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:48,361
Do we have an ETA?

85
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,278
Anyone have eyes on her?

86
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,197
One minute.

87
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,415
You're cutting a little close there, honey.

88
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:06,920
- What's in that?
- Turmeric, uh, bee pollen, ginger.

89
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,588
She's off ginger. Make it again.

90
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,257
- She's not gonna drink it?
- Make it again.

91
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:13,094
Oh, okay, great.
I was hoping I got to do that.

92
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,519
Get these out of here.

93
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,563
She'll shit.

94
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,988
- Good morning, Mrs. Kell.
- Hi, Kiki.

95
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,490
Oh my God, feel my hands.
They're still shaking.

96
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:36,992
He hesitated at first,

97
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,911
but then he unfurled his wings
and he soared into the sky.

98
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,705
It was sublime.

99
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,707
I am so proud of him.

100
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,916
Congratulations.

101
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,502
- Hey hey.
- Hey hey.

102
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:50,756
Mrs. Kell, your smoothie.

103
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:54,135
Thank you so much, Patrice.

104
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:55,845
Not today.

105
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,223
What time does Peter get back today?

106
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:04,102
I got an alert
that they were delayed leaving Tokyo,

107
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,563
but, um, let me see what I can find out.

108
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:07,897
Just ask Liam.

109
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:10,191
Oh, Peter gave him
the weekend off for Labor Day.

110
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,109
Oh my God.

111
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:15,196
- Should I have given you the weekend off?
- With the gala? No, I wouldn't let you.

112
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,865
I'll get an ETA. I'm into it.

113
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:17,783
Great, thanks.

114
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:22,538
Oh, your dress is done.
They're flying it in today.

115
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,582
Setting a fitting for Sunday a.m.

116
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,500
Perfect.

117
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,128
And I told Tom you wanna do the gold eye.

118
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,379
No, bronze.

119
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,382
- I want a bronze eye.
- Bronze eye? Right, sorry.

120
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:35,593
Bronze eye.

121
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:37,802
We should sext Peter,

122
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,305
let him know I'm looking forward to
some husband and wife time.

123
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,641
Okay, good idea.

124
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,185
Got it. Right.

125
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,228
- Yeah.
- Okay.

126
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,481
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, wait.

127
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,857
Give me more boob.
We need more boob squeeze.

128
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,359
- Okay.
- Yeah, right.

129
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,735
- Okay, chin up.
- Uh-huh.

130
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,904
Hot, literally so hot.

131
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,489
- Ah.
- You're literally a goddess.

132
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,782
Oh, come on, don't.

133
00:10:58,783 --> 00:10:59,949
No, you are.

134
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,369
Say something dirty, but not too dirty.

135
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,328
Uh...

136
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,412
Okay.

137
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:07,124
I wanna ride you

138
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,959
when you get home,

139
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,002
Daddy.

140
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,712
- Nice.
- Nice.

141
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:15,632
We have a few time-sensitive things
for when we're back.

142
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,093
- Like?
- Last minute gala RSVPs.

143
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,220
I did a pass on our revised seating chart.

144
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,389
- And what's the head count?
- 110.

145
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,059
And John Legend agreed to do
a short set for such a good cause.

146
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,603
Excellent.

147
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,563
- We need to write my gala toast.
- Oh. Done.

148
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,232
It's in your cloud.

149
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:35,610
- What would I do without you?
- Uh, you would hire a new assistant?

150
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:36,529
No.

151
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,196
I wouldn't.

152
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,989
You're irreplaceable.

153
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:43,077
And I don't wanna imagine a world
without you in it with me.

154
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,621
Me neither, Kiki.

155
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,658
Hey, do you happen to know
where this house is?

156
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,994
Sure, everybody knows the Cliff House.

157
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,413
Fare is 75 bucks.

158
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,789
- Holiday pricing.
- Oh, fuck.

159
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,166
Or you can walk.

160
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:35,128
Last house, way out on the point,
few miles past the lighthouse.

161
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:38,174
- A few miles past the lighthouse?
- Yeah.

162
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,108
Hi, Joel.

163
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,443
Oh, Mrs. Kell, hello.

164
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,737
- How's he doing?
- Oh, he's doing amazing.

165
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,864
- Where is he? Can I see?
- Yeah, of course.

166
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,074
Here, come on back.

167
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,206
All right.

168
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:15,543
You see, you let Barnaby out
here on Grand Point,

169
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:16,962
and he's already here.

170
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:21,424
Caught a southwest wind.
He's really feeling himself.

171
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:23,510
I told you he'd be okay.

172
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:26,387
You said it was too soon, but I know him.

173
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:29,057
You were right.
What an amazing rehabilitation.

174
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:32,352
Most rescue organizations,
they would have left Barnaby for dead.

175
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:35,980
We are not most rescue organizations.
Where's our new visitor?

176
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,107
Right over here.

177
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,320
Hi.

178
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,115
Hi.

179
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,785
Hi there, little guy.

180
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,411
What's your name?

181
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,123
What do you think, huh?

182
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,334
Hi.

183
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,210
Hi.

184
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,963
Good boy.

185
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,631
Yeah.

186
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,842
Aw, Winston.

187
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,970
We're so happy to have you.

188
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:53,851
Oh God.

189
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,561
Fuck!

190
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,237
Stop talking about me, Jose.

191
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,822
- I'm not.
- I know you guys shit-talk me.

192
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,866
On your little group text chain.

193
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,327
What group text chain?

194
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,292
Why are these blue?

195
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,002
Hydrangea is blue.

196
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:06,005
No, we wanted white or white-ish blue.

197
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,882
Never blue. Who signed for this?

198
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:09,134
I don't know.

199
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:14,848
Okay.

200
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:23,107
Listen up, everyone.
It is Labor Day weekend.

201
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,484
The Kells are entertaining every day,

202
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:30,489
and we have a black-tie event Monday.

203
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:34,075
We need to tighten up our game, okay?

204
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,577
All details flow through me.

205
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:39,288
Yeah. Simone is captain now.

206
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:40,541
Shut up, Jose.

207
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,668
I'll get floral back over here too.

208
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:44,753
- Simone.
- What?

209
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:48,214
There's a transient person
at the house asking for you.

210
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,467
She's carrying hot garbage.

211
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,135
What?

212
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,887
She says she's your sister.

213
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:08,067
Oh my God. No. No, no, no.

214
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,737
Do not be Devon. No. No, no, no.

215
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,407
No. No. No. No.

216
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,700
Oh no.

217
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,411
No, no, no. No.

218
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:23,875
No, Devon, no.

219
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,960
- No. Why?
- Fuck you, you fucking bitch.

220
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,921
- You sent me an edible arrangement?
- How did you even get this address?

221
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:31,466
I told you dad got diagnosed
with early-onset dementia,

222
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,969
and you sent a fruit basket?

223
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,764
Okay, okay, I can see that you're upset,

224
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,724
but this is a really bad time for me
right now.

225
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,476
- We're about to host a reception.
- Okay.

226
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:44,062
Well, then don't send me fruit,
you stupid bitch!

227
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,354
Welcome, ladies.

228
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:48,317
Sips and nibbles are in the back.
Thank you.

229
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,193
What is this place?

230
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,570
And why does everyone
look like an Easter egg?

231
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:56,532
Look, Devon, I can't talk right now.
I am working.

232
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,618
- I work here.
- Mmm. You are always working.

233
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,703
You've been sending me
to voicemail for months.

234
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,330
Yes, it's the high season.

235
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,831
What the hell is a high season?

236
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:06,710
It's when society is here,
like, summering.

237
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:11,799
Who are you?

238
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,134
- Devon.
- No, seriously.

239
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,220
You're dressed like a doily.
Where are your tattoos?

240
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,555
I removed them.

241
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,601
Our matching sister tattoo?

242
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,187
It was trashy.

243
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,856
It was trashy?

244
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,111
And your face is weird too, isn't it?

245
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,071
- Did you do something to your face?
- No.

246
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:35,988
Oh my God.

247
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:38,116
- You got a nose job?
- No, I...

248
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,492
When did you get a nose job?

249
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:42,662
Okay, I... I fixed my deviated septum
back in April. Kiki has a guy.

250
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:43,663
The fuck is Kiki?

251
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,414
Oh, Michaela, she's my boss.

252
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:49,418
I get to call her Kiki,
which is a... it's a really special honor.

253
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:53,090
Hi, girlies. Hi, just go on back. Yeah.

254
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,927
- Easter egg. Easter egg. Easter egg.
- Okay.

255
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,221
Devon.

256
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:00,972
You have to go.

257
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,932
- Where?
- I don't know where.

258
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,227
All right? Just anywhere but here.

259
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,730
Simone, I just traveled 17 hours

260
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,691
to see you.

261
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:13,067
I don't know. You should've called first.

262
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:15,403
I don't have time for you.
I don't have time for you today.

263
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,029
I don't know why I didn't think of that.

264
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,073
Make time.

265
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,199
Otherwise,

266
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,369
I'm gonna be having sips and nibbles
with all the rest of those Barbies.

267
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,288
No.

268
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:26,290
You wouldn't.

269
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,457
Okay, fine, fine, fine.

270
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:32,963
I will hide you in the... guesthouse
until this is over.

271
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,800
You, clean this up.

272
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,643
Is this still their property?

273
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:49,313
Uh, yeah, it's a compound.

274
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,191
Jesus, you said they were rich,
not oligarch rich.

275
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,108
Who is this guy?

276
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,737
Peter Kell of the Kell Securities.

277
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,239
The famous hedge fund.

278
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:01,074
Worth billions.

279
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:02,408
Asshole.

280
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:06,162
He's actually, like, super nice.
So is Kiki.

281
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,455
Yeah? What does she do?

282
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:12,293
Well, she was a high-powered attorney,
but now she does, like, volunteer work

283
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,628
and animal activism.

284
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,962
- Bitch. Whore.
- Devon.

285
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,007
Sorry. I have rich people Tourette's.

286
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:24,096
Okay, uh, don't touch anything.

287
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:26,308
Don't talk... to anyone.

288
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:31,355
Uh, don't sit on the furniture,
and don't touch the linens.

289
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:35,566
Uh, Zeus, turn up the AC.

290
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:38,194
Yeah, cool, Georgia O'Keeffe. I have that.

291
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,071
No, you don't. That's real.

292
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,406
- Okay, I will be back.
- When?

293
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,283
When I am done working.

294
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:47,788
Okay? Oh, you can make yourself a drink.
Not top shelf, though.

295
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,122
I don't drink.

296
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:52,376
- You don't drink? Since when?
- I'm sober.

297
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:55,337
I've been trying to be sober
for the past six months.

298
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,673
Is that why you texted me "Sirens"?

299
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,842
Not much of an SOS code
if you don't answer.

300
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,639
Dad keeps asking me where Mom is.

301
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,642
His memory's getting really bad.

302
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:11,978
Last week he got lost
trying to get to the VA,

303
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:15,481
and, um, the police found him
in the parking lot of a 7-Eleven.

304
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:19,277
I have to drive him
to all of his doctor's appointments.

305
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,988
- I have to pick up all of his medications.
- I can send you money.

306
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,156
I don't want money, Simone.
I need help with Dad.

307
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:25,157
I don't do Dad.

308
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:26,784
Tough titty. It's your job too.

309
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:31,455
I've been... losing my mind
trying to do all of this by myself.

310
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,165
We have some tough choices to make.

311
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,042
He's not gonna be able
to take care of himself much longer.

312
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:37,170
- That's not my problem, so.
- Simone.

313
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:40,007
Who's this?

314
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,550
Kiki. Oh my God!

315
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,552
Hi!

316
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:46,054
- Our guests are congregating.
- Uh...

317
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,432
Th... This is my, uh, sister, Devon.

318
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,934
She just... showed up here

319
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:53,602
completely unannounced.

320
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:57,441
- Did I know you had a sister?
- I'm sure I've... I've mentioned her, yeah.

321
00:21:58,525 --> 00:21:59,526
Hi.

322
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,694
Hi, Devon.

323
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:04,281
I'm Michaela... Kell.

324
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:06,325
How's it going?

325
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:07,784
It's, uh...

326
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,411
It's quite the house you have here.

327
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,164
Oh, quite a sister you have here.

328
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:14,958
Not a huge resemblance, is there?

329
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,002
No.

330
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:20,129
Uh, Devon looks like our dad.
I look more like our mom.

331
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,883
You did, before you fucked with your nose.

332
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:27,303
By the way, um,
the next time one of your "guys"

333
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:29,430
is gonna do plastic surgery on my sister,

334
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:30,806
maybe let me know.

335
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:33,100
People die under general anesthesia.

336
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,728
- I didn't know she was going under.
- I didn't know you existed.

337
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,230
Well, now you do.

338
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:43,445
Wow.

339
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,447
I just, um...

340
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:49,742
I can't believe that you two
are meeting right now.

341
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:52,037
My brain is like, "What?"

342
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:55,373
- It's crazy.
- I know. It's marvelous.

343
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:59,377
And I just wanna tell you
how much I adore this sister of yours.

344
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,338
- Aw.
- She is sweet and kind and good

345
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:05,424
and we have been true-blue friends
from the minute we met.

346
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:07,051
- Right?
- Yeah, instant besties.

347
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,636
It's like a total mind merge.

348
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:09,805
Good for you.

349
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,474
I can't usually be friends
with people who pay me.

350
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:14,017
Okay.

351
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,186
So, let's head over to the reception.

352
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:19,730
- Yeah.
- And we'll let your sister unpack.

353
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:22,983
Oh, she's not staying here.
I'm just sticking her in here for now.

354
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:24,402
- Okay. Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

355
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:27,363
Yeah, I'm just gonna crash
wherever Simone lives.

356
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:29,782
- Where do you live?
- I live here, stupid.

357
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,242
You live at work?

358
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,744
I'm a live-in assistant.
I have my own suite in the main house.

359
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,996
Oh. Looks like I will be staying.

360
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:37,957
That's fine.
We're very, very happy to have you.

361
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,709
Let me know where your luggage is.
I'll have it sent over, sweetheart.

362
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,963
Oh, no luggage.
I'm just gonna wash my undies in the sink.

363
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,090
Great.

364
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,581
How did I not know you had a sister?

365
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,836
I don't bring her up
because she does stuff like this, like...

366
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:28,300
She shows up, periodically, to smear
her hot mess disaster sauce all over me.

367
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,679
I'm so sorry, Kiki.

368
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:39,268
- Do you want me to make her leave?
- No, I mean, she came all this way.

369
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:41,187
I'll get her out of here tomorrow.

370
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,730
What do you think she wants?

371
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,315
What she always wants.

372
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,818
To make me feel guilty
because I left Buffalo.

373
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:49,696
Anything in my teeth?

374
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:51,364
Nope. Me.

375
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:53,908
Perfect.

376
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,451
Breath?

377
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,203
Ten out of ten.

378
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,914
Mine?

379
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:00,623
Six.

380
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,334
Mmm. Take my gum.

381
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:20,851
OMG, Kiki, you look drop-dead.

382
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:23,187
Predicting a major fundraising today.

383
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:26,106
I feel alive, and also happiness.

384
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:28,400
Let's go save some wildlife, bitches.

385
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:30,570
Oh yeah!

386
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:56,470
Hey, Ray.

387
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:59,139
Where the hell are you?
Your shift started two hours ago.

388
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,267
I'm glad you called. I need a favor.

389
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:04,019
No, no, D. You're supposed to be
on the floor right now.

390
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,354
<i>I just sat you.</i>

391
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:07,523
Yeah, not gonna make it in.

392
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:09,984
<i>- What do you mean?</i>
- I had to go out of town quick.

393
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,610
Devon, this is your job.

394
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:14,196
If you don't show up, I have to fire you.

395
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:16,782
Ray, you know you can't fire me.

396
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:20,536
Listen, I need you to go to my house
and check on my dad, okay?

397
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:23,247
<i>What? No fucking way. I'm not doing that.</i>

398
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,249
His pajamas are in the dryer.

399
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:28,294
<i>Just drink a Labatt with him, you know?
Maybe help him with his butt cream.</i>

400
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:32,798
Hell no! I'm not babysitting your dad, D.
I have a restaurant to run.

401
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,091
I'll call your wife.

402
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,843
<i>That is not funny.</i>

403
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,678
Tell her you're my sometimes fuck boy.

404
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,973
- <i>Do not call me that. That's hurtful.</i>
- I know her number.

405
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,099
<i>No, you don't.</i>

406
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,270
716-847-1065.

407
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:51,026
All right, tell your dad
I'll be there before dinner.

408
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:01,869
<i>Hello, can I help you?</i>

409
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:06,206
Yeah, I'm trying to go outside
and I can't.

410
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:09,044
<i>So sorry about that. Here, try now.</i>

411
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,504
<i>Oh, and by the way,</i>

412
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:15,800
<i>there's a strict no-smoking policy
on the grounds, Miss DeWitt.</i>

413
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,141
Hello?

414
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,728
Jesus Christ!

415
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,355
Fuckety, fuck, fuck, fuck!

416
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,272
Jesus!

417
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:14,066
There's no smoking on the property.

418
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:16,068
I'm outdoors. This is outdoors.

419
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,027
Oh no, no.

420
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:20,489
This is a nature preserve. You are in
a federally protected wildlife sanctuary.

421
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:23,409
It is illegal to smoke.
Please do not light that cigarette.

422
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:26,121
- One puff.
- You don't understand, lady.

423
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,040
No, you don't understand, man.

424
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:32,292
I just worked a double at Falafel Balls
and spent the night in jail

425
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:34,545
and then I slept
on a fucking Peter Pan bus.

426
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,881
Can you just throw me a bone, please?

427
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:42,804
You a Bills fan?

428
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:45,765
Yeah, go Bills! Why? You?

429
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:47,975
- Dolphin fan.
- Oh.

430
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,602
- Ah.
- Yeah.

431
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:53,480
Fuck the Chiefs?

432
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:55,607
Oh, the Chiefs can get fucked.

433
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:57,026
- Fuck the Chiefs.
- Yeah.

434
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:59,612
Okay, we have a spot. Follow me.

435
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:03,616
Right here, see?

436
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:05,535
No cameras.

437
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:07,287
This is the staff.

438
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,206
This is Missy, Eddy. Guys.

439
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,792
This is Simone's sister, Devon.

440
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:15,878
What the hell, Jose?
She's gonna rat us out to her sister.

441
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,379
Oh, relax. She's cool.

442
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,008
I vetted her.
She just wants to have a cigarette.

443
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:21,468
Give me a bagel.

444
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,304
You guys are pretty hungry, huh?

445
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:27,765
Carbs aren't allowed on the property
ahead of the Gala Monday.

446
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,602
- Fucking starving.
- Who banned carbs, Michaela?

447
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:35,648
We can't talk about her.

448
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:38,150
Whole staff's on an NDA.

449
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,569
Oh, excuse me.

450
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:43,363
Guys, break is over. Come on, let's go.

451
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:44,866
- Yes, Peter.
- Jose.

452
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,661
Be careful here, sis.

453
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,375
Careful of what?

454
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,349
- Simone.
- Sorry.

455
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,267
Yeah.

456
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:13,018
- Look at this.
- Hmm?

457
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:14,770
He hasn't liked our sext.

458
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:17,105
I mean, he's seen it,
but he hasn't replied.

459
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:19,149
- He usually replies immediately.
- Uh...

460
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,568
Maybe he's lost signal.
He's in the air, after all.

461
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:22,736
Is he definitely in the air?

462
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:25,072
Yeah, I assume so. He's gone so quiet.

463
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:25,990
Stop.

464
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:28,493
Where's the rose garnish?

465
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:35,123
Manifest said he departed
2130 local time, so...

466
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:38,044
- Let me know when you get confirmation.
- Yeah, of course.

467
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:42,965
<i>Your sugar, yes, please</i>

468
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:45,844
<i>Won't you come and put it down on me?</i>

469
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:50,932
Hey, don't bury it, huh?

470
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:55,644
I'm not the valet.

471
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:58,063
Oh, God, I'm sorry. You were coming at me.

472
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:00,900
You're dressed like a... like a valet.

473
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,530
- There he is.
- Yeah, that's...

474
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,197
Sorry about that. Um...

475
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:10,200
- Can I escort you to the kitchen?
- I'm not going to the kitchen.

476
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:13,120
Oh, aren't you a... Are you?
Sorry, are you not a cater waiter?

477
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:16,540
You're... You're wearing all black,
and you've got a whimsical hairstyle.

478
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,583
Yeah.

479
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:20,002
I don't work here.
I'm just visiting my sister.

480
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:22,004
Oh. Who's your sister?

481
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:22,922
Simone.

482
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,466
Simone? The... The assistant?

483
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:27,385
Yeah.

484
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,679
Oh. Um...

485
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:31,555
You are her sister, huh?

486
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:34,266
I don't know how
I can make it any clearer, buddy.

487
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:35,642
Oh, sorry. Um...

488
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:39,730
Simone and I, we... we talk a lot,
and she's just never mentioned a sister.

489
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:44,109
Huh. Well, she should have.
I basically raised her in Buffalo.

490
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,570
- Buffalo, New York?
- Yeah, that's where we grew up.

491
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,989
Well, it's where I grew up.
She was in and out of foster care

492
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,451
until I finally got custody of her,
but you know, that's...

493
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:53,703
Who are you?

494
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,288
Ethan Corbin.

495
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:59,499
Uh, Ethan Corbin III,
if we're... if we're going all in.

496
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,751
Yeah, I live next door.

497
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:04,254
Well, not exactly next door.
All the way down on the end there.

498
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:07,008
- Hmm.
- Maybe Simone has mentioned me?

499
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:08,801
No.

500
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:14,098
Well, uh... can I escort you inside?

501
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:15,642
No.

502
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:18,352
Okay.

503
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:22,523
Then I will walk adjacent to you,
like in Victorian times, yes?

504
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:42,669
No, did you, uh... did you two meet?

505
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:44,252
Yeah, very briefly.

506
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:45,170
- Yeah.
- Okay.

507
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:48,174
No, we didn't get properly introduced
because I, uh...

508
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,969
- I... Well, I...
- He thought I was the valet.

509
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,054
- You didn't.
- Yeah.

510
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,682
Uh, I'll go fetch us some drinks.

511
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,225
What would you like, milady?

512
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,143
Pass.

513
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:04,023
- And for Ms. DeWitt, the usual?
- Yeah, thank you so much. Thank you.

514
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:08,235
That guy's an asshat. I hate it here.

515
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:09,403
Are you almost done?

516
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:11,613
I told you I'm at work.

517
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:14,992
I came to talk to you,
not sit in some weird guesthouse all day.

518
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,285
What is this, some kind of ceremony?

519
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:20,706
Devon, Devon, please,
go back to the house.

520
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:24,710
I'm just gonna sit in the back.
No one's even gonna notice I'm here.

521
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:27,672
Everyone is noticing you.
You're dressed like a roadie.

522
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:30,216
It's fine. I'll be cool.

523
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:34,262
Let us come together.

524
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:41,601
Hi. Hi.

525
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:42,811
Oh, thank you.

526
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:46,774
So, um, I didn't realize
you were from Buffalo.

527
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,860
Yeah, upstate New York.

528
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:53,530
Yeah, but you said upstate New York
in a Westchester way

529
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,992
or... or like Darien, Connecticut, you know?

530
00:33:56,993 --> 00:34:00,996
No one knows where... where Buffalo is,
so it's just... it's easier to say upstate.

531
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:03,916
Right. I thought you were a Yale girl.

532
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,502
I am a Yale girl.

533
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:11,173
People who don't come from money
can... can also go to Yale.

534
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,924
- You know? Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

535
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:15,218
And, I mean, you were in foster care?

536
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:18,889
That's, like, you're from tough times.

537
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,476
I'm so sorry that that happened to you.

538
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:25,730
We will begin as we always begin.

539
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,482
Whoa, is she holding a scepter?

540
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:31,319
- "In every outthrust headland..."
- Why?

541
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:33,945
"...in every curving beach..."

542
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:39,368
"...in every grain of sand,
there's the story of the Earth."

543
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:43,538
- What is this?
- "There is something infinitely healing..."

544
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:47,667
It's a... It's a poem by the patron saint
Rachel Carson. That's how we always begin.

545
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:51,755
"The assurance that dawn comes after night

546
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:54,174
and spring after winter."

547
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,760
"Change is eternal,

548
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,553
change is life."

549
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:01,516
Hey hey.

550
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:05,393
- Okay, this is officially a cult.
- Now...

551
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:06,978
- You're in a cult.
- Okay, stop.

552
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:11,274
I am very proud to announce
that this morning...

553
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,734
Ow, what's your problem?

554
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:15,863
- ...released Barnaby, the peregrine falcon.
- Stop it!

555
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:19,866
- Did you tell Ethan I was in foster care?
- So? Who cares?

556
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:21,159
I care.

557
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,538
It's my past.
It's up to me who I share it with.

558
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,373
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize that was a secret

559
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:28,041
we had to keep from rich douchebags.

560
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:31,045
He's not a douchebag. He's...

561
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:33,839
He's my boyfriend.

562
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,715
Simone, don't be mean.

563
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,092
He's 400 years old.

564
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:39,595
You... You cannot tell anyone, Dev,

565
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:42,556
but, um, we've been quietly dating
since June.

566
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:45,392
- Promise me you won't say anything.
- Wait, you aren't joking?

567
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:46,560
No.

568
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,228
There's duckies on his blazer.

569
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:50,689
I... like his duckies.

570
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,482
No, you don't. You like his Rolex.

571
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:56,736
Our biggest fundraiser of the year,
the Labor Day Gala, is on Monday.

572
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:58,864
You don't know the first thing
about our relationship.

573
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:02,576
What I know, Simone, is that you've been
too busy waiting on a trophy wife

574
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,703
and fucking Mr. Duckie to show up for me.

575
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,830
No. These people are my friends.

576
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,040
Oh, grow up, Simone. You're the help!

577
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:09,959
...support--

578
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:13,837
Where was I?

579
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,381
Um, the proceeds will support
the rehabilitation...

580
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:17,299
Don't move.

581
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:22,597
...of our newest resident,
Winston, the baby red-tailed hawk.

582
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:25,599
Aw.

583
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,018
- Can I get a "hey hey"?
- Hey hey!

584
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,521
Hey hey!

585
00:36:58,299 --> 00:36:59,175
Hi.

586
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:03,304
Let's you and me take a walk.

587
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:11,269
What do you think of the view?

588
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:13,022
Uh, where did Simone go?

589
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:16,733
I love to stand here and look out.

590
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,861
Makes me think of <i>Moby Dick</i> times.

591
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:20,237
Cool.

592
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,114
All those sailors

593
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:24,700
crashing their boats on the rocks.

594
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:26,535
All the blood.

595
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,581
Sometimes I think
I can still hear the whales

596
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:33,292
singing their mournful song.

597
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:35,211
Do you hear it?

598
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:37,505
Mournful whale songs, yeah.

599
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:42,176
- So listen, I really gotta find Simone.
- There she is. Thank you.

600
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:45,930
This... is for you.

601
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:47,931
What is it?

602
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:48,849
Look.

603
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:59,318
What is this? Why are you giving me...

604
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:01,070
$10,000?

605
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:03,656
It's a gift for you.

606
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:05,950
I...

607
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:08,994
I don't want your money.

608
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:13,081
No, caring for aging parents
is such an expense to pay.

609
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:14,000
No.

610
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:17,962
No, Michaela, not okay. I didn't come here
because I want your money.

611
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:19,672
I came here because

612
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,258
I want my sister...

613
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,302
to help me.

614
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,470
And voilà.

615
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:28,722
- Jose.
<i>- Sí, mi amor.</i>

616
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:31,516
Would you take Devon to the Whaler Inn?

617
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:33,518
We have you booked in the Admiral Suite

618
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:37,063
and you are leaving
in the first flight out tomorrow morning,

619
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:38,065
business class.

620
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,234
Sorry, what?

621
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:41,694
Um...

622
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,529
Are you kicking me out? Is that--

623
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:47,032
Well, it's just...
it's such a busy weekend, so...

624
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:47,950
Yeah.

625
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,994
Can I speak to you privately, Simone?

626
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,998
I think that it's best that you go, Devon.

627
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:56,208
Hello?

628
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:01,004
Are you seriously gonna let
this bitch bribe me to leave?

629
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,715
- This way, please.
- Wait.

630
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,343
It was terrific to meet you.

631
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:06,968
Simone!

632
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:08,303
Safe home.

633
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,181
Hey, let's go. Come on.

634
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,452
Hey, you wanna go see the old lighthouse?

635
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:35,247
It's got the best sunset view.
I can drive by if you want.

636
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:37,416
No.

637
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:39,168
Thanks.

638
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:42,671
Hey, come on,
don't take it so personally, huh?

639
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:45,549
How much did they give you?

640
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:49,469
$10,000.

641
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,637
$10,000?

642
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:51,889
Wow, that's...

643
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:54,350
that's not bad.

644
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,436
You know, the... the Whaler Inn is nice too.

645
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:04,192
Oh, uh, sorry, but when you can,
you know, if you... if you don't mind,

646
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:06,069
uh, can you sign this, please?

647
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,570
No, I'm not signing an NDA.

648
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:10,407
Well, if you don't sign it,
then it'll be like a whole thing.

649
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,993
Just sign it
and forget about this place, you know?

650
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:19,959
Good.

651
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:29,051
You wanna come up front with me?

652
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,389
I'll let you smoke.

653
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:43,815
You're gonna eat your words
when the Dolphins win the Super Bowl.

654
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:46,693
Okay. No, no, no,
let me get the door for you. Come on.

655
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:47,736
Uh...

656
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:49,946
- You don't have to do that.
- Stay there.

657
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:53,451
The car service will be here at 8:00 a.m.
to take you to the airport.

658
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:56,911
Hey, thanks.

659
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:57,872
Oh, yeah.

660
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:00,332
Oh, no, yeah.

661
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:09,174
- What are you doing?
- Ugh!

662
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:12,386
- I have a wife. I have a son.
- Yeah, sorry, I'm sorry.

663
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:13,929
Ugh!

664
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:15,598
God.

665
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,267
It's a thing I... It's a thing I do.

666
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:20,101
You lick people?

667
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:22,021
I don't mean to do it. It's... I...

668
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,441
I don't do it on purpose.

669
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,859
I'm texting someone about it.

670
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,068
Texting someone?

671
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:31,155
Yeah, I got a text therapist, you know?

672
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,699
Real one's too expensive, so...

673
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,409
Okay, crazy.

674
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,660
The room is under your name.

675
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:41,623
She put a card down for incidentals,
so go ahead and do your worst. Okay?

676
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:43,000
- Hey, Jose.
- Yeah.

677
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:46,253
I'm really sorry.

678
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,797
It's fine.

679
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:50,257
Okay.

680
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:52,968
Don't lick nobody in there,
though, please.

681
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:55,930
I won't.

682
00:41:57,973 --> 00:41:59,350
Okay. Okay.

683
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:14,072
Oh shit.

684
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:15,074
Uh...

685
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:21,538
Hey, Dad, you okay?

686
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,665
<i>No, someone's breaking in.</i>

687
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:27,126
No, Daddy, I texted you about this.
Remember, that's my friend Raymond.

688
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:28,670
Remember Ray from high school?

689
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:30,922
<i>He's not in high school. He's old.</i>

690
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:31,965
<i>I'm 32, sir.</i>

691
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:33,591
I asked him to come check on you.

692
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:35,885
<i>He's fine. He's watching war movies.
I'm gonna go.</i>

693
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,720
No. You gotta stay
and cook the pizza for him,

694
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:39,682
and then cut it up
into little pieces, all right?

695
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:43,643
<i>When are you coming home?</i>

696
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:44,853
Uh...

697
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:46,396
Tomorrow.

698
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:49,399
And, hey, in the morning, Ray's gonna
bring over your medication, okay?

699
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,316
<i>What? I am?</i>

700
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:52,903
<i>Where are you, honey? I... I miss you.</i>

701
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:54,612
Thanks, Dad. Uh...

702
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:57,491
Yeah, I, uh... I'm with Simone.

703
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:59,033
<i>Simone?</i>

704
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:00,661
<i>Why didn't you say so?</i>

705
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:02,997
<i>How's she doing?</i>

706
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:04,872
Great.

707
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:07,917
Yep, really good
and, uh, really excited to see me too.

708
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:11,588
So, just, uh...
We're just having some sister time.

709
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,424
<i>Really, she's okay?</i>

710
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:16,968
<i>I don't hear from her.
Does she get my emails?</i>

711
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:18,011
Uh...

712
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,597
I... I don't know, Dad.

713
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,641
<i>Will you tell Simone that I love her?</i>

714
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:25,977
<i>And if she ever wants
to come home to visit,</i>

715
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:28,022
<i>it would be wonderful to see her.</i>

716
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:30,816
<i>I know I don't deserve it.</i>

717
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:33,901
Yeah, listen, I gotta go, all right?

718
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:35,779
- I'll talk to you later. Bye.
<i>- Wait. Wait, no.</i>

719
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,662
Can I help you?

720
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:45,581
Yeah.

721
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:47,750
Can you put all this on room 19?

722
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:51,503
Thanks.

723
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:27,748
All right, there you go.

724
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:29,749
Hi. Something to drink?

725
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:34,171
Uh, seltzer water for me
and whatever he's drinking.

726
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:36,839
You're buying me a drink?

727
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,342
Expense account.

728
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:41,261
- Thank you.
- Oh, for sure.

729
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,058
Enjoy.

730
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:49,019
So,

731
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:50,979
where are you from?

732
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:55,067
Can we just go,
or do you need a little small talk first?

733
00:44:57,736 --> 00:45:00,738
Uh, I think I need some... some small talk.

734
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:02,574
Oh, cute, okay. Um...

735
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:05,411
Christina

736
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:09,414
Grey from Seattle.

737
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:11,666
Uh, I'm a tech millionaire.

738
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:12,626
- Wow.
- Yeah.

739
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:15,002
I feel like you just made that up.

740
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:16,255
- Your turn.
- Okay.

741
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:19,924
I'm Jordan St. Clair from L.A.

742
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:23,219
- I'm in real estate and high-end sneakers...
- Ah.

743
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,430
...and that's my yacht out there.

744
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:26,515
Oh.

745
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:31,270
I was gonna suggest my hotel room,
but a boat...

746
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:33,439
That's way better.

747
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:39,193
So, have you had enough small talk yet?

748
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:40,278
- Yeah, I'm good.
- Okay.

749
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:41,988
Can I finish my drink?

750
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:44,158
I don't know.
Are you gonna sip it like a baby?

751
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:51,247
Dock's this way.

752
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:53,250
- Wait, you actually have a boat?
- Yeah.

753
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:55,127
And keys.

754
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:28,488
- Got something for ya.
- Ooh.

755
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:36,288
Wait, why do you have this?

756
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:41,334
Anderson's Beef on Weck.
This is my sister's sweatshirt.

757
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:42,335
What's Beef on Weck?

758
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:43,754
This belongs to my sister.

759
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:45,714
How do you know Simone?

760
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:48,467
Simone's your sister?

761
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:50,010
Oh God.

762
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:53,262
- Are you dating her too?
- No, no.

763
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:57,684
Simone is... is dating my boss, Ethan.
This is his boat.

764
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:01,355
What? I thought this was your boat.

765
00:49:02,397 --> 00:49:03,357
I'm the captain.

766
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:07,318
Sorry. We were...
We were doing the lying game.

767
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:09,946
Oh, I just fucked
my sister's boyfriend's boat guy

768
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:12,239
in my sister's boyfriend's bed.

769
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,867
Wow, sorry. Uh...

770
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:18,579
I wasn't lying
about being into you, though.

771
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:22,250
We were really vibing down there,
don't you think?

772
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:26,129
I mean, come on,
is your... is your name really Christina?

773
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:30,509
- It's Devon.
- Yeah.

774
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,679
And you're the second guy
I fucked on a boat today.

775
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:35,973
Okay.

776
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:38,809
I think I miss the lying game.

777
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,318
Don't say it.

778
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:52,072
- I have to go. I know.
- No, no, no.

779
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:55,825
Peter's flight keeps getting delayed,
and... and Kiki's restless.

780
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:59,204
Okay, can I...
can I talk to you about something?

781
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:02,123
What about...

782
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:04,167
- About what? What?
- No, it's okay.

783
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:09,756
Well, I know we kind of stumbled
past it this morning, but, um...

784
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:14,011
I really do love you, Simone.

785
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:19,141
I'm in love with you.

786
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:22,060
I wanna know everything about you,

787
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:23,854
even your childhood.

788
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:31,319
If you love me,
you won't make me talk about this.

789
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:35,198
Can I at least know
who your family members are?

790
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,163
Well, I had a mom,

791
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:43,331
but she died.

792
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:45,125
I have a dad.

793
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:48,086
We don't speak.

794
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:49,796
Um...

795
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:51,464
I have a sister.

796
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:53,507
- Ah, yeah.
- That is her.

797
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:56,386
The rest is control-alt-delete.

798
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:00,891
Why were you in foster care?

799
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:03,727
Please. Can we...

800
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:06,146
- Okay.
- Thank you.

801
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:09,524
All right.

802
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:16,782
But did you hear the "I'm in love
with you" part of what I said?

803
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:19,533
I love you too.

804
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:21,870
Ah.

805
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:32,672
Is that the Cliff House?

806
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:34,758
Hard to miss.

807
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:37,511
There's a scope over there
if you wanna take a better look.

808
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:39,721
What's the deal with that place?

809
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:43,599
- It really seems like a cult.
- Yeah.

810
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,643
Don't let Michaela hear you say that.

811
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:47,395
What's with all the cameras?

812
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:51,357
And apparently she, like,
controls everything the staff eats.

813
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:53,068
Yeah, I've heard.

814
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:56,196
You know they call
your sister Mini Michaela, right?

815
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:00,742
<i>She does this.</i>

816
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:03,161
<i>She gets swept up in other people.</i>

817
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,163
<i>Loses herself.</i>

818
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:08,624
<i>The only person
who knows the real Simone is me.</i>

819
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:09,918
<i>Who's the real Simone?</i>

820
00:52:10,418 --> 00:52:13,713
<i>A traumatized little girl
who's always trying to outrun her past.</i>

821
00:52:14,714 --> 00:52:16,550
She was really not herself today.

822
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:19,469
I mean, there was something, like,

823
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:23,681
gone... behind her eyes.

824
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:24,933
- You know?
- Yeah.

825
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:26,977
Like a zombie.

826
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:28,812
I don't know.

827
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,983
Something just doesn't feel right
about leaving her up there.

828
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:27,162
Barnaby!

829
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:33,292
Oh no!

830
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:35,127
No! No!

831
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:37,505
Barnaby! No!
