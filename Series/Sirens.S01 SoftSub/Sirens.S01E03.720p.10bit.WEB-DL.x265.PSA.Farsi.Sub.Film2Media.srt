[wind whooshing]

00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,079
Kiki!

Kiki, wait!

10
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:50,300
[echoing] Kiki, I'm sorry!

00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,636

Monster!

- [gasps]
- Hey, hey, it's a dream. You're dreaming.

20
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,663
It's just a nightmare. You're okay.

21
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,916
[inhales deeply] I'm here.

22
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,126
[breathing heavily]

23
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:27,087
Where am I?

24
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:31,799
You're in the guesthouse. I brought
you back here last night with Jose.

25
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,719
- You had a really bad panic attack.
- I did?

26
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:36,471
Yeah.

27
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,515
Did anyone see?

28
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:40,808
[breathing heavily]

29
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,477
No. Um...

30
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:46,480
You were in the pantry.
I told them all you had food poisoning.

31
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,858
Wait, what... what... what time is it?

32
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,736
- Like, 7:00 something.
- In the morning?

33
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,321
- Yeah.
- Wait, in the... [mumbles]

34
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,906
- Hey, Simone.
- Uh...

35
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:59,535
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Be careful.
I gave you two Xanax. Take it slow.

36
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:00,536
[panting]

37
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:01,663
Where's my...

38
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:03,331
What's the...

39
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,999
Um... [exhales]

40
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,043
I don't know what to do.

41
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:08,586
About what?

42
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:11,630
[exhales] I don't...
I don't know what... what to do.

43
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:14,968
- What's going on? Talk to me.
- I missed jogging.

44
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:16,718
- Okay.
- 'Cause... 'Cause...

45
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:19,889
'Cause we run, you know,
we run every morning.

46
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,349
- Where's... Where's my phone?
- Hey, Simone. Breathe.

47
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,851
- I lost my phone.
- You didn't.

48
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,062
- I plugged it in. It's right over there.
- Okay.

49
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,274
[Simone panting]

50
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,236
Did you do something to my phone?

51
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,697
- I don't have any messages or texts.
- Hey, whoa, crackhead.

52
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:39,616
I picked you up off the floor last night
and took care of you.

53
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:42,912
No, you don't understand, Dev.
I'm going to get fired.

54
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:46,123
- For missing jogging?
- [sobbing]

55
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,292
No, because she knows
that I'm dating Ethan.

56
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,169
She knows I've been lying.

57
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,963
Oh my God, I'm such an idiot.

58
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:54,631
This is all gonna... gonna...

59
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:56,675
It's all gonna go away now.
I'm gonna get fired.

60
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,011
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- [sobbing]

61
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,805
Hey, would it be the worst thing
if she did fire you?

62
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:04,975
- Yes. [sobbing]
- This place is giving you panic attacks.

63
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:09,104
No, you are giving me panic attacks.
What are you still doing here?

64
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:11,148
I told you. I need help with Dad.

65
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,650
[Simone] And I said, "No."

66
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:16,446
You don't get to say no to me, Simone.

67
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,115
And guess what? Everything that happened
to you as a kid happened to me too.

68
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:22,327
This isn't just the Simone show.

69
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,954
I had to live what Mom did.

70
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:28,332
So? I had to see it,
and I had to sign for it.

71
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,917
- I had to save you from it.
- [scoffs]

72
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:33,587
- You don't think that fucked me up?
- No, I don't. I am the fucked up one.

73
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:36,340
- I think we're both fucked up.
- No, it's me. It really is me.

74
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:39,843
- I... I am super fucked up.
- Oh yeah? Well, quadruple your fucked up.

75
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:42,721
Climb to the top of Fucked Up Mountain,
and that's how fucked up I am.

76
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,890
- You're absolutely fine.
- I am not fine.

77
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,477
- Yes, you are!
- I just got my second DUI.

78
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,232
Wait, what do you mean your second?

79
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,236
I'm a drunk like Dad.

80
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,447
And I'm drowning,
and I'm waving a flag at you,

81
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,158
and your hand's on the doorknob.

82
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,036
Please.

83
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,082
Let her fire you.

84
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,505

[Simone] Kiki.

89
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,569
Kiki.

90
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:42,531
Kiki!

91
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,826
[music intensifies]

92
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,333
Ki-- Kiki!

[Simone] Kiki.

104
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:46,596
Kiki!

105
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,639
Oh, hey, Simone.

106
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,850
I am... I am so sorry I'm late.

107
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:55,020
It's not the Army.
You don't have to do morning PT.

108
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,104
[Michaela panting]

109
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:57,397
How's your tummy?

110
00:05:57,398 --> 00:06:01,693
Your sister said you were, uh,
and I quote, "Peeing out your ass."

111
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:06,239
Oh, I'm fine now. I am. Look, I'm so sorry
I disappeared on you last night.

112
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,700
Don't worry about it.

113
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,661
Get some rest.
We'll... We'll catch up later.

114
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,041
Kiki, are you mad at me?

115
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:18,169
Is that a yes?

116
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,129
You seem mad.

117
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,424
Why would I be mad?

118
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,844
Me and, uh, Ethan,
I... I know that you know.

119
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:29,305
Honey, I don't care who you date.

120
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,891
Your love life is your business.

121
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:36,019
- You're... You're not upset?
- No. Over a summer fling?

122
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:36,937
No.

123
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,105
Enjoy yourself.

124
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,147
[panting]

125
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:42,318
Use a condom, though. That man
greets the ferry with his fly down.

126
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:46,530
- Wait, does he?
- Yeah, and, uh, his finances are a mess.

127
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,033
He blew through his trust fund
a long time ago.

128
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,536
You're not serious about him, are you?

129
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:56,873
Well, I mean,
we... we were kind of getting serious.

130
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:57,792
He, um...

131
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,585
- He told me he loved me.
- [sighs] Ah.

132
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:01,962
I'm sure he did.

133
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,463
You know, I just... [sighs]

134
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:05,674
I just hate that you felt
that you couldn't tell me.

135
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,176
- Like I'm some kind of a monster.
- What?

136
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:11,681
Now I have this awful feeling
that you... that you keep things from me.

137
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,723
I don't, Kiki.

138
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:16,351
You are dating my husband's friend,

139
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:18,562
and you have a sister
that I don't know about.

140
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:19,813
Is there anything else?

141
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,357
No, that's it. I swear.

142
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,819
Did your mom really die in a car accident?

143
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,242
No.

144
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,996
But... But that's... that's not a lie.

145
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:36,998
Um...

146
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:39,666
She didn't...

147
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:43,128
- She didn't die in... in a car accident.
- Okay.

148
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,506
But, um, yeah, she did die in a... in a car...

149
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:47,467
Um...

150
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,763
She... She ran a tube from...

151
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:58,185
from the exhaust pipe
to the front seat and, um...

152
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,937
and killed herself.

153
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:02,190
Oh...

154
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,734
- How old were you?
- I was seven.

155
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,819
Um...

156
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:08,862
[sniffles]

157
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:09,780
I...

158
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:13,034
I was in the... I was in the back seat,

159
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,828
and she told me to...

160
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:17,455
Um...

161
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,166
[chuckles sadly] She...

162
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,586
She told me to color in my coloring book

163
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,713
until I fell asleep.

164
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:27,507
Oh my God.

165
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:29,424
Yeah.

166
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:33,804
Devon, she... she found us, pulled me out,
and rushed me to the hospital.

167
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,100
It's okay, Kiki.

168
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:42,604
They were able
to resuscitate me right away and...

169
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,856
Honey, nothing about that is okay.

170
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,566
- You know, it's not like--
- It's not okay.

171
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:49,819
It's not like I understood
what had happened to me at the time.

172
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,279
You know? I didn't... I didn't know.

173
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,989
I'm gonna take care of you.

174
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,032
[Simone sniffles]

175
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:58,620
And you'll get nothing but kindness,
nothing but goodness from now on.

176
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,540
- Yes, please. Thank you.
- Okay.

177
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,959
Thank you so much, Kiki.

178
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,252
[Simone sighs]

179
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,254
Thank you.

180
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,881
[Simone sobbing]

181
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,010
[Eddy exhales]

182
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,180
How long are you in town?

183
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,057
Bye.

184
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,560
[breathes deeply]

185
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,818
[exhales deeply]

186
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,695
Hey fucking hey.

187
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,990
[breathes deeply]

188
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,075
[bright music playing]

189
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,161
[birds chirping]

190
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,465
[indistinct chatter]

191
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,305
Oh, hey, Jose, Patrice.

192
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,223
Missy.

193
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:01,891
- Iron chefs.
- Wow, okay.

194
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:04,394
Does that dress, like, come
with batteries or something?

195
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,312
Ha-ha.

196
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,230
Shut up. Have you seen Simone?

197
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,941
- No.
- She's still out jogging with Mrs. Kell.

198
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,402
Nice. Do you mind if I make a coffee?

199
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,613
You know you can have that
brought to your guest house?

200
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,615
Oh, I got it. I'm not a real guest.

201
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:20,536
Are you sure? Because you were just added
to the VIP guest list for the gala.

202
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,245
I was?

203
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:24,582
Yes, you were.
Now, don't let it go to your head.

204
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:25,916
Okay.

205
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:31,130
Just be over here, then,
activating the chrome.

206
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:34,091
- I got you.
- Thanks. [sighs]

207
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,510
So, what's all this?
Is this, uh, prep for the gala?

208
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,929
This is for the cocktail hour
before the gala.

209
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:43,267
Ah, the party before the party.
Right. I like that.

210
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,145
How many of these galas
have you done, Patrice?

211
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,355
Uh, sixteen.

212
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,483
[softly] Sixteen. Wow.

213
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,443
So, you would know

214
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:55,236
Jocelyn Kell,
the first wife, wouldn't you?

215
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,364
[cutlery clatters]

216
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,116
Or should I say "knew"?

217
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,035
Past tense.

218
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,920
I feel like you guys
should be able to hear...

219
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,838
me, the words that I'm saying.

220
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,925
[unsettling music playing]

221
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,934
How far do these bitches run?

222
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:31,607
[phone clicks]

223
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,359
[keypad clacking]

224
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,321
[line ringing]

225
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:41,074
<i>Hi, you've reached Bruce DeWitt.
This is his daughter, Devon.</i>

226
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,493
<i>He hates the phone, so just call me.</i>

227
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:44,494
<i>Uh...</i>

228
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,580
[keypad clacking]

229
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,417
[line ringing]

230
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,043
[line clicks]

231
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,670
[on voicemail] <i>Hey, you got Ray's phone.</i>

232
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:54,839
[sighs]

233
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:56,965
[phone thuds on railing]

234
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,968
[gentle music playing]

235
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,763
Hey! Big sister!

236
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:05,766
Up here.

237
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:23,409
Oh, that's the way
to start the day, Big Cheese.

238
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,245
Come on in. The water's fine.

239
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,581
[Peter exhales]

240
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,126
I like the decor in here.

241
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:37,173
It's, uh, nautical, but make it stoner.

242
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:40,509
One corner of the house
that still gets to be mine.

243
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,179
- Isn't the whole house yours?
- Mmm.

244
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:44,846
[inhales deeply]

245
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,974
So, you having a nice time on the island?

246
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,601
[exhales] It's a vibe, man.

247
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,935
[both laugh]

248
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,061
[Peter] Yeah.

249
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,938
Hey, how are your dreams?

250
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:57,610
I... I always have the craziest dreams
when I'm on-island.

251
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,403
- Really?
- Mmm.

252
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:01,989
I don't dream.

253
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,449
Never?

254
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,827
I looked it up once.
It's either because I drink too much

255
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:10,581
or I have
a very severe personality disorder.

256
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:11,999
Um...

257
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,626
Both track, honestly.

258
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,711
Hmm.

259
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,299
You stay here long enough,

260
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,134
you'll start to dream.

261
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,385
Maybe you're dreaming right now.

262
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:25,428
[chuckles]

263
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:26,930
Who's dreaming? Me or you?

264
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,016
We could be sharing a dream.

265
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,062
It tends to happen around her. [chuckles]

266
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:36,440
Her?

267
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:39,026
Mmm.

268
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,862
I mean, here.

269
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:43,572
Sorry.

270
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:45,825
[Peter sighs loudly]

271
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,536
So, what are your plans today? Beach?

272
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,873
No, I'm just waiting
for my sister to get back from

273
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:57,670
the world's longest run with your wife,
who she seems to, uh,

274
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,504
really worship.

275
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,422
Yeah.

276
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,217
Kiki has that effect on people.

277
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,011
How did, uh...

278
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,180
How'd you guys meet?

279
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,978
Well, it's not the most romantic story.

280
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:18,439
Her firm represented
my company in a merger,

281
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,651
and she had to step down from the case,

282
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,779
and I had to step out of my marriage.

283
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:25,489
[inhales deeply]

284
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,409
But here we are. [exhales]

285
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,035
Happy ever after.

286
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,419
You okay, Big Cheese?

287
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:41,922
[inhales sharply]

288
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:43,465
Yeah.

289
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,301
Yeah.

290
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:49,972
Uh, actually, I have a tee time.

291
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,807
I gotta go.

292
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,309
[Devon] Oh.

293
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,145
Hey, finish this off for me.

294
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:57,688
I can.

295
00:14:58,647 --> 00:14:59,565
And I will.

296
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,861
I'll see you when we wake up.

297
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,699
[footsteps receding]

298
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,493
[footsteps descending stairs]

299
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:19,043
- Mrs. Kell, FedEx--
- Terrific. Thank you, Missy.

300
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,002
[indistinct chatter]

301
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,296
[Patrice] Your smoothie.

302
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:27,134
Oh, it looks delicious.
No, thank you. Not today.

303
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,720
[sighing] The step and repeat.

304
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,890
Gives me chills every year.

305
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:37,310
Thank you, Jose, to you and your team
for all your hard work.

306
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:40,104
I know it will look amazing.

307
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,023
- Bravo.
- Thank you, <i>mi amor.</i>

308
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,609
Bravo.

309
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,070
[whispering]

310
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,701
Okay. Listen up, everyone.

311
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,036
- I have notes.
- [staff groaning]

312
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,412
[Jose] Oh, goodness.

313
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:58,206
[pensive music playing]

314
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,000
[Devon snoring]

315
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,471
[keypad clacking]

316
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,730
[keypad clacking]

317
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,197
[slurping]

318
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:31,740
Wow.

319
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:35,076
Patrice, you make one hell of a smoothie.

320
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,537
- [both laugh]
- Thank you, sir. Thank you.

321
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,497
You know,
it's really a creative outlet for me.

322
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:40,456
[Peter] Hmm.

323
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:42,417
- It's one of my main creative outlets...
- Simone.

324
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,837
- ...'cause it's something-- Okay.
- Hold on one sec.

325
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,131
How are you feeling after last night?

326
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,258
Oh, I'm... I'm...

327
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:52,302
I'm okay. I just, um... I had a bad oyster.

328
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,680
[softly] Jose told me.

329
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,223
[Simone] Uh...

330
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:58,767
[mouthing] Yeah.

331
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,854
I get panic attacks too.

332
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:06,691
But, of course, you know that because
you schedule our marriage counseling.

333
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,485
Yeah, um, just please don't tell Michaela.

334
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,362
I just don't want her
to worry about me or...

335
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,197
No, no, no. I... I won't.

336
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:17,744
She views my attacks
as a... as a failure of will,

337
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,287
so I'm gonna spare you from that,

338
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,956
but I just want to make sure
that you are okay.

339
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:24,125
I find them really scary.

340
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,585
Yeah, they... [chuckles]

341
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:26,920
Yeah, they are, um,

342
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,840
but, um, yeah, no. I'm... I'm okay.

343
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,633
Okay.

344
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,596
[door opens, closes]

345
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,848
- Simone?
- [Simone] Yeah?

346
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,892
- Come look at this.
- Okay.

347
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,229
Uh, they're identical.

348
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,689
- Are you blind?
- No.

349
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,649
This ribbon is matte,

350
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,985
and this is ever so slightly metallic.

351
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:53,696
This is from Tokyo,
and this is from someplace sketchy,

352
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,866
like Soho House.

353
00:17:56,784 --> 00:18:00,161
Well, the labels are the same.
If he didn't buy it in Japan,

354
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,747
he sure went through a lot of trouble
to make it look Japanese.

355
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:03,707
Exactly.

356

00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:12,632
Wednesday, Tokyo."

any idea where he is, do you?

370
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:42,371
Uh... Uh, no, we haven't talked yet today.
I can tell him you left word, though.

371
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:46,834
Yeah, right. I could...
I could leave word with you.

372

- Yeah, sorry.

I just don't...

376
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:02,349
I just don't know what to say.
The whole thing is just so awkward.

377
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:07,103
What did you say to him, anyway?
It's weird that he's not texting me back.

378

- Who?
- Ethan.

on the cliff last night.

380

bothering Simone anymore.

She wanted me to tell you
she'd be back for dinner.

Dinner. [inhales]

Simone told me about your mom.

452

My mother died when I was young too.

453
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:40,377
It leaves a mark.

454
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:45,424
Walking around in the world, I can always
spot the motherless woman in the room.

Were you jealous?

When she chose Simone?

460

What kind of question is that?

Being spared is sometimes worse.

and a very traumatized
little girl to raise.

468
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,920
That's too much responsibility
to put on you at such a young age.

469
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:28,967
You've worked so hard for so long,
haven't you?

470
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:33,763
Underneath all that armor,
you just need someone to say, "Good job."

471
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,726
I didn't do a good job.

472
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,396
Yes, you did.

473
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,399
You saved her.

No, I left her.

475
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,449
I went to college.

476
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:58,704
And she was all alone in that house
with... a clinically depressed dad

477

478

She was in hell.

You came back.

483
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,183
She missed most of seventh grade.

484

When I came back,
she was dangerously thin.

485

- Hmm.

536
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,408
Come in and take a seat.

537
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:42,452
Okay.

538
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:45,121
[Jose clears throat]

539
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:49,209
[grunts]

540
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:51,378
[keypad clacks]

541
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:53,880
- Jose.
- Hmm?

542
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:58,008
I just logged on to see when Peter
might be available for dinner tonight,

543
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,178
and our calendars are no longer synced.

544
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:02,304
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

545
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:04,890
All the passwords and PINs
have been changed,

546
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,226
and locations are off.

547
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,687
That sounds like an IT problem.

548
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:12,315
Don't play games with me, Jose.

549
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:14,775
What?

550
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:15,943
[laughs]

551
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,612
What game is this, huh?

552
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:20,572
English is not my first language.

553
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:22,616
<i>- Oh, sí, sí. Claro.</i>
- [Jose] Hmm.

554
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:25,245
[speaking Spanish]

555
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:26,704
[inhales sharply]

556
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,038
I'm sorry. Your accent.

557
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,290
[speaking Spanish]

558
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:33,252
Why'd you lock me out of the system?
Did Pete ask you to?

559
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:35,671
I don't even know how
to turn on the computer, <i>mi amor.</i>

560
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,549
All you do is computers.

561
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,510
I'm just a property manager, okay.

562
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:42,345
Okay.

563
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,598
Where was Peter last weekend?

564
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:47,684
Japan.

565
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,269
Where was he, really?

566
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,230
- Japan.
- All right, fine.

567
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,275
If you want to do it this way,
you're fired.

568
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,527
I... [laughs]

569
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:03,116
- You can't fire me.
- Oh, yes, I can.

570
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:06,952
It's come to my attention
that you've been writing abusive texts

571
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:09,913
about Simone to the staff,
so get your things and go.

572
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:10,873
No.

573
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:11,915
No?

574
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,667
What do you mean, no? You're fired.

575
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:16,004
I work for Peter, not for you.

576
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:20,091
I've been with him 19 years now.

577
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,427
Much longer than you have.

578
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:27,140
Contractually, you cannot fire me.

579
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,809
Neither could the first Mrs. Kell.

580
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:33,521
Not that she ever would have,
you see, because, well,

581
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,983
she was a kind woman.

582
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:43,573
Will there be anything else, <i>mi amor?</i>

583
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:44,949
No.

584
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:46,868
Okay. [clears throat]

585
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:50,538
Watch your fucking back, Jose.

586
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:55,335
Very good.

587
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:59,964
I'll call the IT guy and let him know
that you have an issue. <i>¿Sí?</i>

588
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:02,133
<i>- Sí.</i>
- Good.

589
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:08,180
[indistinct chatter]

590
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:10,599
[Michaela on phone]
<i>All right. What's he doing now?</i>

591
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,728
Uh, he's buying weed at the Baked Clam.

592
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:15,270
[sighing] Ugh!

593
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:18,982
[Simone] <i>Oh, it's a big haul.
Yeah, gonna be a very chill day.</i>

594
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:21,109
Oh. Now he's looking
in the window of a bakery.

595
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,528
[Michaela] <i>This is thrilling.</i>

596
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:25,824
Um, he's not sure about the muffin.

597
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,283
He wants it, but he's torn.

598
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:29,201
[sighs]

599
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,328
[phone vibrating]

600
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:33,747
Ooh. I need to take this.
I'll call you back.

601
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:34,958
Everybody out.

602
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:36,709
Everybody out.

603
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:40,254
[phone clicks]

604
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,340
[suspenseful music playing]

605
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:45,969
[indistinct chatter]

606
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,100
[indistinct chatter and laughter]

607
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,394
All right, have fun. See you later.

608
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,480
[redeeming music playing]

609
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:02,235
[car engine starts]

610
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:17,499
- [Michaela] What'd you find out, Phil?
- <i>Yeah, there is a no-cheating clause.</i>

611
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,293
<i>That means if he is having an affair,</i>

612
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:22,254
<i>we can get the prenup voided,
but we need proof of infidelity.</i>

613
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,881
Well, what counts as proof?

614
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,633
<i>Not chocolate boxes.</i>

615
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:29,554
<i>You know, emails, pictures, videos, texts.</i>

616
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,722
I can get that.

617
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,850
<i>Look, I can't believe
someone let you sign this thing.</i>

618
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:36,894
<i>You're an attorney. I can't believe
you let yourself sign this thing.</i>

619
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:40,105
I was being love-bombed by a billionaire.
I didn't care what it said.

620
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:41,941
I just dotted my i's with hearts.

621
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:44,484
<i>I understand. All right.</i>

622
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:46,737
<i>Let me get into things on my end.
I'll call you back.</i>

623
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,531
Phil, Phil, wh... what...

624
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,824
What if he's not having an affair?

625
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:51,992
<i>You said he is.</i>

626
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:55,203
What if I'm wrong,
and... and he files for divorce anyway?

627
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:57,789
Are there... are there
any financial protections for me?

628
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,501
<i>Well, there are a lot
of provisions in the prenup,</i>

629
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:03,254
<i>primarily if you'd been able
to have children.</i>

630
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,965
Well, that wasn't in the cards, was it?

631
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:08,801
<i>Sorry. I know this is a painful subject,</i>

632
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:12,304
<i>but try to keep things positive at home.
Don't get shut out.</i>

633
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:14,265
<i>Just quietly gather proof.</i>

634
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,100
Copy that.

635
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:17,601
Thanks, Phil.

636
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,395
<i>All right. Talk soon.</i>

637
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:20,855
[phone chimes]

638
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:28,738
[birds chirping]

639
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:34,452
Oh shit, shit, shit.

640
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:36,954
Simone?

641
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,122
Oh!

642
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:40,291
Peter!

643
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,586
That's a... That's a weird coincidence.

644
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:47,006
Did my wife have you follow me?

645
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:50,969
No, I just come here sometimes to clear...

646
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:52,387
[hesitating]

647
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,347
Yeah, I...

648
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:56,557
- I'm so sorry. Um...
- Wow.

649
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,686
She really is shameless.

650
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:01,062
Well,

651
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,106
park your bike right over there.

652
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:06,066
Oh, I'll just...
I'll tell her that I lost you.

653
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,610
Uh, nope. No, no, no.

654
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:09,277
You're busted.

655
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:12,281
Your penance is
you have to come quahogging with me.

656
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:14,742
What... What? What hogging?

657
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:17,286
Quahogging.

658
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:19,205
What's a...

659
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,416
- Come on.
- Oh, okay. Yeah.

660
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:29,382
[Lisa, Cloe, Astrid] Gala dress!
Gala dress! Gala dress! Gala dress!

661
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:34,428
Oh my God. Look at you serving
royalty-slay-smash-mama, ten out of ten.

662
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,512
[in unison] We'll take it.

663
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:38,432
No. This dress is $22,000.

664
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,225
- Kiki's treat.
- She insists.

665
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:41,435
- Treat, treat.
- [Devon] No.

666
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:44,312
I don't even look good in this dress.
I look like Beetlejuice.

667
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:45,814
[pensive music playing]

668
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:48,525
Devon, you listen to me right now.

669
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,444
- Listen to her, Devon.
- Listen to her.

670
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,237
You are beautiful.

671
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:55,949
You contain multitudes. You're a goddess.

672
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,660
- [in unison] We'll take it!
- No.

673
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,163
No.

674
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:02,749
No.

675
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:08,212
Are these things really called quahogs,
or are you pulling my leg?

676
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,881
Quahog.

677
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:15,553
Also, the official clam of Rhode Island,
where I hail from.

678
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,097
I thought the Kells were OG New Yorkers.

679
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:20,600
On my mother's side.

680
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:22,934
Her father...

681
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:23,852
[grunts]

682
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:25,312
...was a fisherman

683
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:29,025
and her grandfather too,
which is why I look so good in these.

684
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:32,070
[Simone laughing] Okay.

685
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,699
It was the chocolate, wasn't it?

686
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:42,163
Michaela knew that
I didn't get it in Tokyo somehow.

687
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:44,999
Yeah, she, um...

688
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:49,587
she had a comparison box
overnighted from Japan.

689
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,923
The ribbon on one was matte,

690
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:53,591
not metallic.

691
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:55,468
Rookie mistake.

692
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:58,930
She thinks you're having an affair.

693
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:02,266
You think I'm having an affair?

694
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:06,645
You weren't where you said you were.

695
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:09,607
You cheated on your first wife.
I... I can see how she got there.

696
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:11,109
Oh.

697
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:13,194
The salsa is spicy.

698
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,028
[laughs]

699
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,739
The salsa works for Kiki.

700
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:25,998
Do you think my wife would be relieved
to hear that I'm not having an affair?

701
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,502
That I, in fact, was attending
the christening of my grandson?

702
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,130
Behind her back?

703
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:33,840
No, she'd shit.

704
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,174
Yeah.

705
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:38,593
You know how loaded this topic is for her.

706
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:40,638
And your kids have been awful to Kiki.

707
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:45,476
Well, they blame her
for my breakup with their mom.

708
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,020
Do you think that's fair?

709
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,647
I think it's maybe not a good woman

710
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:53,401
that wants me to sever ties
with my children for any reason.

711
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,320
I haven't seen my son in a decade,

712
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:59,323
and now, he's a dad.

713
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,367
He's holding his son.

714
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:03,619
That was...

715
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:07,290
That was the most glorious moment
in my life,

716
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:09,542
meeting that little baby,

717
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:11,711
and I'll...

718
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,547
never get those years back.

719
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,299
[sniffles]

720
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,262
Do you have a picture?

721
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:23,930
- Yes.
- Photo? Yeah?

722
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:25,808
- I do. Yeah.
- Can I see?

723
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,231
[gasps] Aw.

724
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:34,441
What's his name?

725
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:37,195
Jonathan Joseph Kell, after my father.

726
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:38,821
Johnny Joe.

727
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:43,617
He looks like you.

728
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:46,786
- Nah. You think so? [laughs]
- [laughing] Yeah. Yeah, he does.

729
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:47,788
Aw.

730
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,209
Thanks for listening.

731
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,628
Yeah, sure thing. [chuckles]

732
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:57,632
[laughing] There's nobody else
I can really talk to about this.

733
00:36:58,174 --> 00:36:59,090
It's all good.

734
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:00,508
- All right.
- Okay.

735
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:01,801
[Peter] Quahog on.

736
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:02,929
[Simone] Quahog.

737
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,138
[glasses clinking]

738
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:06,348
[in unison] We'll take it.

739
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:07,308
[exhales sharply]

740
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:08,767
I... Uh...

741
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:11,269
I can't... I can't accept this.

742
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,355
Yes, you can.

743
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:15,399
Kiki calls it radical generosity.

744
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:19,236
It's a really big deal
that she invited you to the gala.

745
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,822
- She obviously sees potential in you.
- [chuckling]

746
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:25,868
Potential in what?
To... waste my day shopping?

747
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:27,744
I'll handle this.

748
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:31,332
We aren't just shopping, Devon.
We're manifesting the life we deserve.

749
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,000
Yeah, with money.

750
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:37,088
I'm a... fast food cashier in Buffalo.

751
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,589
I was a teaching aide in Trenton.

752
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,424
I was a nail tech in Florida.

753
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,051
I'm a Sagittarius.

754
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,720
Kiki saw potential in us too.

755
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,764
- To what, marry rich guys?
- I'll handle this.

756
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,766
We didn't pursue them, Devon.

757
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,769
They... came to us.

758
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:53,937
We have special powers.

759
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,022
[in unison] All of us do.

760
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:59,901
[Cloe] When you love yourself,
when you project strength and confidence,

761
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:02,028
Mother Nature bends to your will.

762
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:04,197
Your gravitational force.

763
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:06,408
- Men will come running.
- [door opens]

764
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:08,411
- I don't really think--
- [Morgan] Devon?

765
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:10,620
Is that you?

766
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:11,830
[mystical music playing]

767
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:12,790
Um...

768
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:14,834
I was just walking by

769
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:16,168
and I saw you.

770
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:18,879
You look beautiful.

771
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:20,423
[in unison] See?

772
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:23,925
[insects chirping]

773
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:27,304
[Peter] Michaela wouldn't know a quahog
if it bit her in the ass.

774
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,222
[Simone chuckles]

775
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:31,391
- What are you gonna do with them?
- Oh.

776
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:35,061
I guess I'll make my famous... chowdah.

777
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:36,980
- Oh.
- You like clam chowdah?

778
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,106
[chuckling] Um...

779
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:40,442
I like New England clam <i>chowder.</i>

780
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:41,359
Oh no.

781
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,320
- Yeah.
- No, not that painted hussy.

782
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:46,115
I make Rhode Island clam chowdah.

783
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:47,532
No cream.

784
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:48,783
No cream, ew.

785
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:49,827
You're cold.

786
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,329
[Simone] Uh...

787
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:52,788
Yeah, a bit.

788
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,332
Oh, you... Oh.

789
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,791
- No, no, stop.
- Well, it's... it's...

790
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:59,920
- You're... You're doing it. Um, so, yeah.
- There you go.

791
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,591
Uh, look, um...

792
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:05,717
about Ethan.

793
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:08,303
- No, Peter, we don't have to talk about...
- I... I... Yeah, I know.

794
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:11,806
But I... I love the guy.
I've known him since he was in diapers,

795
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:14,226
but he does this.

796
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:16,187
Does what?

797
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:20,482
He ghosts the beautiful women
that he's been courting all summer,

798
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,777
and then, come Labor Day,

799
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:24,444
poof.

800
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:25,654
He's off to London.

801
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:29,408
Ethan hasn't ghosted me.

802
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:31,493
Oh.

803
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:34,830
Well, sure, look,
I would love to be wrong.

804
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:36,790
[smacks lips]

805
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,459
Well, I'm sorry.

806
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:40,877
- No, it's...
- No, I ruined the afternoon.

807
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:44,298
No, you... No, it... I...
Look, I appreciate you telling me.

808
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,383
Um... [smacks lips]

809
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,301
Yeah.

810
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:51,638
It's beautiful out here,
so thank you again for taking me clamming.

811
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:52,764
Uh...

812
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:53,681
What?

813
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:54,642
[both] Oh!

814
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:56,893
- I forgot, qua...
- Quahogging.

815
00:39:56,894 --> 00:40:00,063
- Don't you mean quahogging?
- [chuckling] Qua... Qua...

816
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,689
- I wanna hear you say it.
- Okay.

817
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,317
- Quahogging.
- Quahogging.

818
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:06,027
- Quahogging. Not hard.
- Qua...

819
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:08,614
- Qua... hogging. [laughing]
- Qua... hogging. [laughing]

820
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:12,201
Um...

821
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:14,870
Sorry. I...

822
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:17,080
[spluttering] I thought that...

823
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,291
I... I don't... I don't know what I thought.

824
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,340
Okay. Um...

825
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:29,050
- Yeah, I'm gonna...
- Okay, wait.

826
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:31,553
- Uh, Simone?
- All right. No.

827
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,513
Simone, wait. Wait.

Hi, um, I just...

835
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:16,473
Please call me back. I just...
I... I'm just really worried about you.

836
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:19,559
I don't really know where you are
or if you're okay.

837
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:23,772
So, um, yeah, if you could just,
like, send me a text, that would be great.

838
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,691
Okay, bye.

- Um...
<i>- I wore emeralds last year.</i>

844
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:47,545
Yeah, there's not much to report.
He's clamming off of Hughes Point.

845
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:51,258
Oh hell, he's not gonna make
that fucking clam chowder again, is he?

846
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:54,093
I don't know.

847
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:55,513
<i>This isn't big enough.</i>

848
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:59,225
<i>No, I'm not... I'm not wearing
a yellow stone with a yellow dress.</i>

849
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,101
Can I be done spying now?

850
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:02,728
You all right?

851
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:05,855
- [gasps] Oh. Save this for the Met.
- [Simone] <i>Yeah!</i>

00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:08,858
<i>Just, um, Peter's not doing
anything suspicious,</i>

Oh.

855
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:14,489
You're probably just tired
and your blood sugar's low.

856
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,616
Go get a snack.

<i>Uh, no. Why?</i>

860
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,213
I'm really worried.
I haven't heard from him today.

861
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,007
It's like he's missing.

862
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:35,010
Oh. I'm sure he's fine.

[Simone] <i>I have a bad feeling about it.</i>

864

Hello?

Ethan?

- Ooh!
- [Morgan] Ooh! Score.

00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:40,492
Hmm.

880
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:48,000
The champ is here.

881
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:51,086
So, how's undercover going?

00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,212
Really good. Yeah.

883
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:55,757
When you said
this bitch kills people yesterday,

884
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:57,800
were you talking about Jocelyn,
Peter's first wife?

885
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:59,802
- Why, do you have intel?
- I asked around a little.

886
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:01,638
- I thought you might be in danger.
- Aw.

887
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,181
People really think she got murdered.

888
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:06,100
She was, like, at the Yacht Club one day
and gone the next.

889
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:07,560
Family never addressed it.

890
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:10,648
Her schooner was just out there
in the harbor rotting for a decade.

891
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:13,025
This bitch is the goddamn devil.

892
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:16,945
I saw it in her eyes today.
She was naked in the bath, singing to me.

893
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:20,740
Anyway, I should go.

894
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:23,494
Oh, wait. Um, I want to ask you something.

895
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:26,120
- Yikes. What?
- [Morgan chuckles]

896
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:27,246
Um...

897
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:29,166
Every year at the end of the season,

898
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:33,169
Ethan pays me to take the boat
down to Palm Beach for the winter.

899
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,171
- That sounds nice.
- Yeah, it's beautiful.

900
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:36,924
I take my time,

901
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:39,259
stop at the beach in North Carolina,

902
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:43,222
and, uh... I was wondering
if you wanted to come.

903
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:47,601
[chuckles]

904
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:49,436
[chuckles]

905
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:52,022
- What? Why not?
- [sighing] Uh...

906
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:54,857
Uh--

907
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:57,735
I take care of my dad full-time,

908
00:44:57,736 --> 00:44:59,070
back home, for starters.

909
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:00,489
You can't take a vacation?

910
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:03,658
[playful music playing]

911
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:05,077
How long is this trip?

912
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:07,121
It's about a month.

913
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:09,707
There's no phone signal.

914
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:11,834
It's just me

915
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:14,253
and the stars

916
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:17,130
and miles of blue.

917
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:18,132
[chuckles]

918
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:21,385
Think about it.

919
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,263
[softly] I leave the day after Labor Day.

920
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:27,349
[playful music continues]

921
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:33,731
- [phone dings]
- [Morgan] Mmm.

922
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:36,859
[phone chiming]

923
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:38,652
Goddammit.

924
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:45,075
Weird, it's your sister.

925
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:48,912
- Huh?
- Simone, are you okay?

926
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:51,831
- [Simone] Look.
- It's luggage.

927
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:54,041
Exactly. All five pieces.

928
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:55,710
[Devon] Sorry, this is interesting, why?

929
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:58,212
He's not packed.
Ethan didn't leave the island early.

930
00:45:58,213 --> 00:46:01,133
He wouldn't go anywhere without his stuff.
Without his watches.

931
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,718
He wouldn't leave
without telling me. He wouldn't.

932
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,636
Slow down. Who said he was gone?

933
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:08,598
Well, Peter said he ghosted me
and left for London early

934
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:11,518
because that's how he treats
his girl du jour every Labor Day.

935
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:13,478
Is that true?

936
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:16,899
I... I... I mean, he has, historically,

937
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,609
not been the most stand-up dude,

938
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,944
no, but he's really smitten with you.

939
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:24,030
Okay. Have you heard from him today?

940
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,823
[Morgan] No, not since yesterday.

941
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:28,534
[Simone] Something is wrong.
When... When did you last see him?

942
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:31,788
[Morgan] Uh, after the service thing
for the dead bird.

943
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,749
He was walking off towards a cliff with--

944
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:35,249
with Michaela.

945
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:36,793
- [gasps]
- What?

946
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,002
- I saw that too.
- Oh my God.

947
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:39,670
She was walking him towards the cliff.

948
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:41,130
- Don't.
- Holy fuck!

949
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:43,466
Don't say it. You'll upset her.

950
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:46,052
Wait, you don't think she urdered-may

951
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:49,222
the ouchebag-day,
just like she did the irst-fay ex-wife?

952
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:50,473
Okay. No, no, no, no, no.

953
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:53,184
Michae-- No, Michaela
didn't murder Jocelyn, Devon.

954
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:55,269
- That's island gossip.
- That's what Lily-Rose said.

955
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:58,065
- Who the hell is Lily-Rose?
- My cellmate in jail.

956
00:46:58,565 --> 00:46:59,774
Oh, right.

957
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:01,609
Your boss put me in jail two nights ago.

958
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,444
[laughing] Wait,
what are you talking about?

959
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:06,030
This is what I've been trying to tell you.
The wool's over your eyes.

960
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:08,992
She's an evil bitch who legit

961
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:10,493
murders people.

962
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:11,786
Jocelyn's not dead.

963
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:13,955
- Have you ever even laid eyes on her?
- No! [splutters]

964
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:15,498
She and Peter are estranged.

965
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:17,000
- But she's not--
- Because she's dead.

966
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:18,709
Just like Ethan is.

967
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:21,838
She found out that you guys were dating,
and she pushed him off a cliff.

968
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:25,508
Wait, okay, everyone just calm down.
Like, this is insane.

969
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:27,969
My boss didn't murder my boyfriend.
She didn't.

970
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,887
Simone, I get it now, okay?

971
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:32,181
She's got like a weird power.

972
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:33,224
She used it on me today.

973
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:35,643
She got her claws in my brain.
I was talking about my feelings.

974
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:37,478
- I went shopping.
- You can hear yourself, right?

975
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:39,272
Oh God. It's so much worse than I thought.

976
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:42,191
[inhales deeply] We have got to
get the fuck out of here!

977
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:44,485
Boat boy, when's the next ferry?

978
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:47,488
- Uh, 6:40 if we leave now.
- Okay, let's get the fuck out of here!

979
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:48,906
Wait, Devon. Wait, wait, wait.

980
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:50,867
- Wait. Can you just... Can you just stop?
- Stop it.

981
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:53,619
- I need a second to process all this.
- Process it on the ferry.

982
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,288
I can't just flake on Kiki.

983
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:57,582
Oh, you'll be long gone
by the time she realizes.

984
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:59,208
[phone chiming]

985
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,251
[whispering] It's her.

986
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:01,377
Don't answer it.

987
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:02,838
Okay, okay, okay.

988
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:05,131
Where are we gonna go?

989
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:06,757
- Huh?
- We'll figure it out on the ferry.

990
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:08,259
[phone ringing]

991
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,719
Is she Find my iPhone-ing you?

992
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,721
Yeah. I mean, she does it
when I don't answer it.

993
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:14,390
No, th-- this is stupid, Dev.
I don't like running from my problems.

994
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:16,518
I feel really good about it.

995
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,312
[Michaela over speaker] <i>Simone.</i>

996
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:22,440
<i>Simone. I know
you're at Ethan's house right now.</i>

997
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:25,484
- What the fuck?
- My locations must be on.

998
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:27,486
She has Ethan's Nest code for emergencies.

999
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:30,740
<i>- Stay put. I'm on my way over there.</i>
- Quick. Let's go out the back.

1000
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,074
Okay. Okay.

1001
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:33,743
[frantic music playing]

1002
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,119
[door lock keypad beeping]

1003
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,121
Shit!

1004
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:38,122
[mumbling]

1005
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:41,042
What is she, The Flash?
How did she get here so fast?

1006
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:43,086
[automated voice] <i>Front door open.</i>

1007
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:45,630
[man] Where is the crapper?

1008
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:47,506
[Ethan] It's three doors down on the left.

1009
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:49,092
- Sounds like Ethan.
- [Ethan] Drink?

1010
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,677
[man] You got any Labatt Blue in a bottle?

1011
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:52,803
Ethan, hi!

1012
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:54,305
[screaming]

1013
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:56,140
- Oh my God.
- It's okay. It's okay.

1014
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:58,184
[Ethan] Ooh! What are you guys doing?

1015
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:01,104
I was so worried about you.
Why didn't you text or call me back?

1016
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:06,442
I left this morning in a hurry,
and, um, well, I forgot my phone charger.

1017
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:08,569
Well, actually, no,
I brought my phone charger.

1018
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:11,530
You know how the old iPhone
had a different thing--

1019
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:14,451
- Look, you scared me. Where were you?
- [man] Oh my goodness.

1020
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:17,204
Is that you, Simone?

1021
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:19,748
All grown up.

1022
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:21,875
Look at you.

1023
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:25,461
Ethan, why did you bring our father here?

1024
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:26,963
[exhales] Um...

1025
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:28,130
[smacks lips]

1026
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:33,679
I... Well, I just... I flew to Buffalo quick
to talk to him about something,

1027
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:37,306
and then he and his nurse, they wanted
to come back to the island with me.

1028
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:39,726
I'm not his nurse. Who's this guy?

1029
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:41,560
That's Captain Morgan.

1030
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:43,020
Like the rum?

1031
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:44,981
That's cool. What's up, Simone?

1032
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:48,735
Wait, I... I... I am... I'm so confused.
Why are any of you here?

1033
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:50,737
Um...

1034
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:52,655
Okay. Okay.

1035
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:54,198
Yeah, no, I was gonna wait.

1036
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:55,450
I was gonna do this

1037
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:58,203
tomorrow morning, but, um...

1038
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,122
we can do this now.

1039
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:04,543
[dramatic music playing]

1040
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:14,803
[dramatic music continues]

1041
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:14,131
[music ends]
