1
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:40,706
<i>How was the trip over? Choppy seas?</i>

2
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:41,957
<i>No, it was gorgeous.</i>

3
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:44,543
<i>This island is
the prettiest place I've ever been.</i>

4
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,711
Mmm.

5
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:49,007
I remember thinking that too,
the first time I saw this island.

6
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,968
Your house is like an art museum.

7
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:55,055
Thank you. Yeah.

8
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:58,557
This is actually
my favorite time of year to be here.

9
00:00:58,558 --> 00:00:59,767
After Labor Day,

10
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:02,853
when all the rank and file
have returned to Back Bay

11
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:06,065
and the Upper East Side,
and it's just me and the beasts

12
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,859
and the sea creatures

13
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,111
reclaiming the island.

14
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:13,782
Why do you want to be my assistant?

15
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:17,910
Honestly, you.

16
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,036
I googled you,

17
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,872
um, and I watched a YouTube video of you

18
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:26,211
speaking about conservation
and preservation, and...

19
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:29,464
you were electric.

20
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:33,885
Something told me
that I needed to come work for you.

21
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,973
You're currently based in New York?

22
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:40,892
Yes.

23
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:44,520
- Where, Manhattan?
- Uh, no, uh, Queens.

24
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:47,272
An area I like to call airport-adjacent.

25
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,857
You work where?

26
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,567
Uh, I tutor full-time at Kaplan.

27
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:53,946
I temp on weekends
at a telemarketing company,

28
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,782
and I work at Starbucks
for the health insurance.

29
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,575
Mmm, humble pie, huh?

30
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:01,411
Yeah, well, beats going home broke
on a Peter Pan bus.

31
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:03,288
That's my drop-dead.

32
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,915
- Where's home?
- Buffalo.

33
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,041
Oof!

34
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,502
Just say "upstate," honey.

35
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:12,465
I'm from an armpit called Fresno,
but I tell everyone Bay Area.

36
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:18,846
So, you did one year
of law school at City College.

37
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,140
Why just one year?

38
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:23,600
You're a lawyer. Um, I read your bio.

39
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:26,353
I don't need to tell you
how difficult law school is.

40
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,271
Mm-hmm.

41
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:30,190
But you got the Goldberg Scholarship
to Yale undergrad.

42
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,400
That's a full ride

43
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:34,362
for exceptionally gifted students
below the poverty line.

44
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,990
I'm surprised that you know that.

45
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,450
I got the same scholarship.

46
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,706
So, tell me why
you really left law school.

47
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:49,794
I hated it.

48
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,965
I think I... I think I felt like I had to go

49
00:02:54,841 --> 00:03:00,053
because I had been saying
that I was pre-law since the second grade,

50
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:02,973
but, um, I only said that because my mom

51
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:06,561
called me a future lawyer one time
and, um...

52
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:09,730
she died young.

53
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,984
So, it just...
it became this idea I clung to.

54
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,861
Yeah. And then I got there,

55
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,239
and it wasn't for me, so... so I quit.

56
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,993
If it doesn't serve you, let it go.

57
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:24,787
I really like that.

58
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,457
My mom died young too.

59
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:30,210
Breast cancer. I was nine.

60
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:35,756
Mine was in a car accident.
A... A drunk driver hit her.

61
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:36,966
I was seven.

62
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,468
I'm so sorry.

63
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,140
Let me look at you.

64
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:49,520
Okay.

65
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:01,616
Come with me.

66
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,123
This is Barnaby.

67
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,293
We found him half-drowned in the surf.

68
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,419
Hi, Barnaby.

69
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,756
Hey, good boy.

70
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,258
Good boy.

71
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:21,385
Yeah, he's very frail.

72
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,637
We hand-feed him every day.

73
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,473
This is what you'll be doing

74
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,309
if you accept the position.

75
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,937
You're offering me the job?

76
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,732
I am.
I think you should start immediately.

77
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,195
<i>What do you say?</i>

78
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,538
Did you hear me, Simone?

79
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,040
My dad is here.

80
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,417
Why is my dad here?

81
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,626
Uh...

82
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:57,129
Could we talk about this
when I'm not on bended knee?

83
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,923
- Why would you do this to me, Ethan?
- What-- Like, the ring?

84
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:01,633
- It was my mom's ring.
- No. No. My dad.

85
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,260
Why would you bring my dad here?

86
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,721
I... I... I was being romantic.

87
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,724
You know, like, grand gesture-type thing.

88
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:13,145
Um, look, Michaela said
some really cruel things to me

89
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,396
yesterday on the cliff.

90
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,231
Well, she called me a selfish man-baby.

91
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:19,735
And she said that I had
no business jerking you around.

92
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:23,071
And I suddenly realized she's right.

93
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:25,365
- I am a selfish man-baby.
- Whoa. Hey. Hey, hey.

94
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:28,160
Let's sit on the couch.
Just take a seat on the couch.

95
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,578
Sorry. He just needs to sit down.

96
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,788
- Just right here. Hey, Ethan.
- I realize I don't--

97
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:34,207
- I don't want--
- Did you happen to bring his meds?

98
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,585
- His nurse packed them.
- I'm not his nurse. They're in his bag.

99
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,003
- Where?
- I have my pills.

100
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,130
- In the ziplock. In the inside...
- Okay, all right.

101
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:43,342
Sorry about that.
Continue, uh, selfish man-baby.

102
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,385
Thank you. Um, okay.

103
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:50,307
Well, what I'm trying to say is that
I've been lost at sea for a long time.

104
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,933
Now here you are.

105
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:55,729
You're the girl of my dreams,
and I want to be worthy of that.

106
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,731
I want to be worthy of you.

107
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:00,317
I want to commit to you,
and... and I want to do it right.

108
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,904
So, I went to ask Bruce for your hand.

109
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:06,615
And... then he and his nurse said
they wanted to come back here with me.

110
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,408
I am not his nurse.

111
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:09,785
I actually came here for D.

112
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:10,827
Hey, what the fuck?

113
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:12,913
You can't leave me with him
without an explanation.

114
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:16,416
- So you schlepped him to a remote island?
- What else was I supposed to do?

115
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,418
Also, you look very hot, by the way.

116
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:19,587
Um...

117
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,673
I'm sorry.
This isn't going the way I planned it.

118
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:26,301
I just... I thought you'd be happy,
honestly, Simone,

119
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:27,803
to have your dad here for this.

120
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:31,515
- I love you. I want to marry you.
- <i>Front door open</i>.

121
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,809
What's going on? Who are these people?

122
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,103
- Um...
- Oh my God.

123
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,063
It's you.

124
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,689
Is it?

125
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,482
- It is.
- What?

126
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,943
It's really you.

127
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:43,903
I knew it.

128
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,155
I felt you coming.

129
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,782
- Hi.
- Hi.

130
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,492
You remember me?

131
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:54,287
Oh, I'm... I'm sure I do.
Would you tell me your name?

132
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:55,206
Bruce.

133
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,916
Hi, Bruce. I'm Michaela.

134
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,001
I know you.

135
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:04,089
We've known each other
for a very, very, very, very long time.

136
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,758
Uh-huh.

137
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,012
- Can you take...
- You are more beautiful than ever.

138
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,683
Oh.

139
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,059
We like to fuck, you and me.

140
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,019
- Oh my God. Dad! Dad!
- Oh my God.

141
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,313
- Hey, Bruce.
- Hey, Dad. Dad.

142
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:21,481
- No, Dad...
- Can you fuck!

143
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:23,942
- This is Simone's boss, Dad.
- She can fuck.

144
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,193
- You're confused.
- The hell I am.

145
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:27,529
You don't know this woman.
This is a stranger.

146
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,365
- This guy, purple shirt, he's very rich.
- Oh.

147
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:32,284
- I came in a jet.
- Uh-huh.

148
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,161
He's going to marry our daughter.

149
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,745
- Well...
- Simone.

150
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:39,332
I'm very curious to hear
what Simone is going to say.

151
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,377
So, why don't-- No, no, no, no, no.
Why don't you stay here?

152
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,255
Hold my hand, and we'll listen.

153
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,632
- Okay.
- Okay.

154
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:49,969
Um...

155
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,848
Simone DeWitt, will you marry me?

156
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:58,685
My dad just said, "Kiki fucks."
I... I can't... I can't do this.

157
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:02,147
- No. No, not like this. I can't. I can't.
- Wait. Simone, wait! Wait!

158
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,565
Simone. Simone, wait.

159
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,609
Wait. No. I'm going after her.
She's my girlfriend.

160
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,861
- You've done enough.
- Let me talk to her. She wants me.

161
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,571
Don't be ridiculous. You're in last place.

162
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,741
Actually, I agree with that.
It would be one, two, three.

163
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:13,867
- Or maybe two...
- Oh, come on.

164
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,869
You deal with your dad,
you deal with your guests,

165
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:16,953
and I will go.

166
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,873
Bye, Michaela.

167
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:21,709
Bye, Bruce.

168
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,089
<i>Front door open.</i>

169
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,176
- Mmm...
- Okay.

170
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,481
What do you mean, there's no bread?

171
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,441
Well, leading up to the gala,

172
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:49,110
Mrs. Kell prefers
that there are no carbs on the property.

173
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,655
Unless it's for a guest or an event.

174
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:55,075
No carbs on my property?
Has she lost her mind?

175
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,536
Oh, it's fine.

176
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,538
We are... We're grateful to have
the opportunity to be so healthy.

177
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,541
- We drink water.
- Yeah. Sometimes we put mint in it.

178
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,334
Or lemon, if we're feeling bold.

179
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:07,003
Well, we are not eating
my dad's clam chowder

180
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:09,130
without some warm, crusty bread

181
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,840
and good, salty butter.

182
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,635
Did someone say crusty bread?

183
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,972
Uh, Cupertino's closes
in about five minutes.

184
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,473
Would someone like to make a run?

185
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:19,808
Me. Pick me.

186
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,017
- Oh, okay.
- I'll go.

187
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:22,728
Why don't you grab some petty cash?

188
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,647
Bread! Whoo!

189
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,567
Shall I set the dining room table
for you and Mrs. Kell, sir?

190
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,778
And you guys too. Please join us.

191
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,700
What's the ping-ping-pinging?

192
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,744
Nothing. Just staff stuff.

193
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:43,457
Oh, come on.
I want to hear the kitchen gossip too.

194
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,001
Um...

195
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:47,628
Well,

196
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,716
apparently, Mrs. Kell's assistant
just got proposed to.

197
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,758
- Simone?
- Yeah.

198
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,428
Mr. Corbin from next door.

199
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:58,430
Five-carat cushion-cut ring.

200
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,932
- Dang.
- Mmm.

201
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:03,810
Wow, that's great news
for the happy couple.

202
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:06,730
Would you like me
to send some champagne to them, sir?

203
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,608
Yeah, I mean, I guess that's what you do.

204
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,234
Right?

205
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:12,945
Oh shit.

206
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,114
I burned the onions. Ow!

207
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,116
Goddamn it.

208
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,388
- Hey.
- Bride-to-be.

209
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:41,682
Congratulations.

210
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:44,225
Yeah. Hey... hey, yeah, we heard the news.

211
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,853
- Wow, that's neat.
- Hmm.

212
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,438
Oh no.

213
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:49,773
What's wrong?

214
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,025
Uh...

215
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,488
Those don't look like tears of joy.

216
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,741
Yeah, it... it was a horror show.

217
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:02,912
Why? Because... you said no?

218
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:07,874
Sorry. Um...

219
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,794
Yeah, I... I really need
to be alone right now, Peter. So...

220
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,588
Wait. Simone.

221
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:17,258
I feel like the biggest asshole
about what happened earlier.

222
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:22,055
You were just trying to be kind to me,
and I... I was way, way out of line.

223
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,557
- I'm re... I'm really sorry.
- It's... It's fine. Let's forget it.

224
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:28,019
The last thing you need
is some old guy trying to kiss you

225
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,440
on the day when you're getting engaged.

226
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,275
Not engaged. Unclear, but...

227
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,653
I won't tell her, Peter.

228
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:39,322
- Really?
- Yeah, don't worry.

229
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,616
I would never ask you for that,

230
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:44,160
because I know
you and Michaela are very close.

231
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:48,498
I... I have as much to lose as you do, so,
um, yeah, it'll be... it'll be our secret.

232
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:49,791
Pinky promise.

233
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,126
- Okay, great. Good.
- Mmm.

234
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,836
- Mmm.
- I mean, okay. Pinky...

235
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:56,715
Pinky promise. And... And, yeah,
I mean, if you're okay with that.

236
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,092
Mm-hmm. Okay.

237
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,969
Uh, again, I... I'm really sorry.

238
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,388
- Mm-hmm.
- Really.

239
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,390
Son of a bitch.

240
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,934
What? I left my phone out there. What?

241
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,979
Jose says Ethan's bringing
everyone over here for dinner.

242
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,188
Oh no!

243
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:16,025
Jose doesn't know what else to do.
All Ethan has in his fridge is Ozempic.

244
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,444
This is a fuck show, man.

245
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,863
This job is a fuck show.

246
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,072
A fuck show, my--

247
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,867
Did you hear that? A fuck show.

248
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:24,993
My Bell's palsy is back.

249
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,328
Come on. We're clear.

250
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:30,458
Every summer.
This happens every summer. Fucking stress.

251
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,254
All right, uh, everyone buckled?

252
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,424
Just don't scratch the leather, all right?

253
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:42,928
This is a woman's car.

254
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,099
<i>Simone?</i>

255
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:49,977
Have you seen Simone?

256
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:52,062
She's in her room.

257
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,814
Also, the photographer
from <i>Vanity Fair</i> is here for you.

258
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:57,192
- Why?
- To approve the proofs from the shoot.

259
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,943
He's been waiting for an hour
in the TV room.

260
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,487
Well, can't Peter do it?

261
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:03,573
He said he specifically needs to show you.
You have final approval.

262
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,450
Well, then he'll have to wait.

263
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,452
Kiki.

264
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,288
- Hi.
- Oh, honey.

265
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:13,041
- Can I talk to you?
- Yes. It's gonna be okay.

266
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:13,959
Okay.

267
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,546
- What should I do?
- Mmm...

268
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,341
Do you want to be Mrs. Ethan Corbin?

269
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:23,928
I don't know.

270
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:28,307
He was a... He was a ten out of ten
in my eyes until now, but...

271
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:31,352
All right, let me ask you
a better question.

272
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,854
Does this look like fun to you?

273
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:37,607
Being a Mrs. Somebody?

274
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,901
Uh, your life looks very fun.

275
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,071
Oh, it is. At first.

276
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,783
I remember my colleagues were so dazzled
when I became Mrs. Peter Kell.

277
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:51,704
I was always jetting off
to Aspen or Majorca or Lake Como.

278
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:55,458
Everyone expected me to quit my job,
but I was like, "No, no, no, no. No."

279
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:58,462
"My career is my identity."

280
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,922
But it happens.

281
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:04,759
You're so busy with the new house
and planning dinner parties

282
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,719
and trying to get pregnant,
and he keeps saying,

283
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,264
"Michaela, just let me take care of you."

284
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,308
And so, one day, you choose to let him.

285
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,144
You send somebody else
to pack up that office

286
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:17,063
that once meant so much to you.

287
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:17,982
So,

288
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:22,987
when you're a Mrs. Somebody,
your life gets huge,

289
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,449
but you get very tiny.

290
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,951
But... But not you.

291
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,495
Your incredible philanthropy
and preservation work.

292
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:35,331
If... If... If Peter were to divorce me,

293
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:38,960
I'd lose everything. The preserve, aviary.

294
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,546
My whole life hinges on his approval.

295
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,505
He loves you.

296
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:43,632
I work for him.

297
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,219
We all do.

298
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:50,680
This isn't about me, though.
This is about you.

299
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:54,559
You don't have to choose
to be taken care of.

300
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,395
You have a big future in front of you.

301
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,397
No, I don't... I don't know about that.

302
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:03,569
Mmm, I do. I want you to start
chairing our foundation in New York.

303
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:09,073
- Kiki, no, I--
- What do you think I was training you for?

304
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,825
I was gonna tell you on the plane.

305
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,911
I want you to run our operations.

306
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:16,372
You'd have an apartment in New York
and triple your salary.

307
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:17,958
Whatever... Whatever you need.

308
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,503
I don't know what to say. Um...

309
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:23,756
Say yes.

310
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,506
I love you, Kiki.

311
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:27,634
- I'm... I'm so lucky to have you in my life.
- Oh.

312
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:28,677
No.

313
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,804
I'm the lucky one.

314
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:47,988
What do you guys think
"not like this" means?

315
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:50,823
Like, when she said, "Not like this,"

316
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:54,035
is that a no or is that, like, logistics?

317
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:57,206
Well, it wasn't a yes.

318
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:58,540
Right.

319
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,709
What did Michaela say
when you asked her to marry you, Pete?

320
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,544
- Yes.
- My wife said yes too.

321
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:06,130
- Mine too.
- Mine too.

322
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,841
Wonderful. Thanks, guys. I'm getting
my heart trampled on over here.

323
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:12,011
Well, it was kind of
an impromptu decision, wasn't it, pal?

324
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,137
No.

325
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,681
No, no, no, no, man.

326
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,934
Like, once I saw it, you know,
the kids, the... the chocolate lab,

327
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,019
the Christmas card, I... I knew I wanted it.

328
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,691
I mean, how beautiful would mine
and Simone's kids be?

329
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,859
And the sex with this woman, Pete. Mmm!

330
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,778
- Jesus.
- Best of my life.

331
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,154
Come on, man.

332
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,699
I want to go back a second.
Raymond, you said you're married.

333
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,075
So, you're not a couple?

334
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:37,413
That's between us two and not you.
Three minus you equals shut up.

335
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:42,792
Hey, who's that guy on the end over there?
I don't know that guy.

336
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:45,086
Oh, that's Eddy. He's on our ground crew.

337
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,005
Hey.

338
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:47,548
Devon.

339
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,466
I'm confused.

340
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:52,552
Is Simone gonna marry
the guy with the jet?

341
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:57,056
We don't know yet.
And, uh, yeah, that's my boss, Raymond.

342
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,641
My married boss, Raymond.

343
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,685
Raymond, my boss with a wife.

344
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:01,729
Oh.

345
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:03,396
You're fuckboy?

346
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:06,399
- What'd you just call me, bitch?
- Morgan, be polite to the nurse.

347
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,236
I'm not a fucking nurse. I manage
a Falafel Balls with a 4.6 on Yelp.

348
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:13,364
I'm a Naval captain
with a USCG Master License, the highest.

349
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,449
Gentlemen.

350
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,745
Let's concentrate on
Peter's delicious clam chowder, shall we?

351
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,998
Why is there a horse in here?

352
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:22,791
Oh, Dad.

353
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:28,171
Peter says that Ethan is eager to talk
and that he wants to come up.

354
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,716
Okay. I feel ready. Send him up.

355
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:34,260
Uh, can we do 30 seconds of admin first
before you dump him?

356
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:35,470
- Of course. Yeah.
- Sorry.

357
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,638
So, while you were spying on Peter,

358
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:40,433
I was trying to get into his email
because Phil said I should get proof

359
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:43,228
he's having an affair,
but I am locked out.

360
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,897
Jose is such a snake.

361
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,733
Do you have any idea
what he'd change his passwords to?

362
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,526
Um...

363
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:52,195
Did you try every device?

364
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,447
Usually doesn't password-protect
his personal phone.

365
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:55,407
Pro tip.

366
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:56,949
Okay.

367
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,159
Knock him dead, baby.

368
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,453
For what it's worth,

369
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,623
I don't think he's having an affair, Kiki.

370
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,374
Hey hey.

371
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:20,265
Ethan,

372
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,601
Simone would like to see you
upstairs at this time.

373
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,479
- Ooh, sounds ominous, bro.
- What? Is she taking numbers?

374
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,648
Can I be next in line?

375
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,899
Hey, uh, wish me luck.

376
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,943
I'd take something harder than wine,
my friend.

377
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,362
- Good luck, Ethan. We're rooting for you.
- Yeah.

378
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,571
- Good luck.
<i>- Vaya con Dios.</i>

379
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,449
- You got it.
- All right, thank you.

380
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,618
Hey, beauty.

381
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,829
Hi, Bruce.

382
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,705
- How are you doing?
- Better now that you're here.

383
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:46,290
What am I interrupting?

384
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,335
I was just inviting Bruce
and Raymond to the gala.

385
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:51,588
Oh. How lovely.

386
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:55,258
Mmm, but, sadly, because someone

387
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:58,219
traveled my infirm father here,
we all have to leave.

388
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,721
Yeah, I gotta work anyways.
Place can't run without me.

389
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:03,099
Devon, are they Buffalo Bills fans
like you?

390
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,934
- Yeah.
- Oh.

391
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:07,019
- Jim Kelly's gonna be here.
- I'm sorry, what?

392
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,355
- Jim Kelly?
<i>- The</i> Jim Kelly?

393
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:11,566
- Who's Jim Kelly?
- Oh my God.

394
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,526
He's the greatest quarterback
in Bills history.

395
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:16,070
Took us to the Super Bowl four times, son.

396
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:17,572
Ever hear of the K-Gun offense?

397
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:18,990
Jim Kelly comes to your gala?

398
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,825
He's got a place on Martha's Vineyard.

399
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:24,120
He pops over once a year.
One year he brought Doug Flutie.

400
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,414
I can't breathe.
You know how I feel about Dougie.

401
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,331
Yeah.

402
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:31,586
I accept your invite to the gala.
If you two need to go, you can go.

403
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,754
No, because if he's gonna stay,
then I have to...

404
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:36,007
Work's canceled.
I'll just burn the restaurant down.

405
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,217
Okay. I'll get my tux guy
over here in the morning

406
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,803
and get you gentlemen all tuxed up.

407
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:41,972
Wonderful.

408
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:45,474
Patrice, do let catering know ASAP.

409
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:47,060
Yes, Mrs. Kell. I will.

410
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:52,608
Is that bread?

411
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:54,985
Mm-mm.

412
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:57,362
Yeah.

413
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:50,666
<i>Hi, Dad.</i>

414
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:52,793
<i>Hello?</i>

415
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:55,712
Go! Bread!

416
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:59,882
Wait. As I recall, he lost
each and every one of those Super Bowls.

417
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:02,051
When was the last time
the Dolphins won the Super Bowl?

418
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,052
- The last--
- Period.

419
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:03,970
Okay, whatever.

420
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:06,389
Before you were born, missy. Okay?

421
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,557
I'm gonna go check
on the gala crew at the bar

422
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,643
and make sure
we're buttoned up for tomorrow, okay?

423
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,478
- Bye, Jose.
<i>- Buenas noches.</i>

424
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,147
- Thank you, Jose.
- Of course.

425
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:17,942
Bruce,

426
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,945
would you care
to retire to my office with me

427
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,739
and drink some scotch
and talk about old guy shit?

428
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,659
Pope wear a funny hat?

429
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,370
Right this way.

430
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,205
Not too much scotch.

431
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,375
- Don't forget your bag.
- All right.

432
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,877
Hey, you own this whole house?

433
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:39,422
It's been in my family for generations.

434
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,589
Wow.

435
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,384
What size water heater
do you need for a place like this?

436
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,678
I have no idea.

437
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,019
Damn, how long does it take
to dump somebody?

438
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,097
It's okay.
I don't need help clearing the table.

439
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:31,390
Happy Labor Day.

440
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:34,561
Right. Oh, that's right.
My very favorite holiday. Here we go.

441
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:39,482
Does it... Does it mean nothing to you
that I... that I flew your dad in?

442
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:40,399
It...

443
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,153
It means that you don't listen.
It means you profoundly misunderstand me.

444
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:46,322
How was I supposed to know
you don't like your dad?

445
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,323
I love my dad.

446
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:50,534
Maybe when I told you that we don't speak,
that might've been a clue.

447
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:53,120
I thought it would be good for you
to see him, mend fences.

448
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,747
Those fences belong to me.

449
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:57,500
Jesus, Simone.
I don't even know who you are right now.

450
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:00,711
You're, like, dark.
It's... It's making me very uncomfortable.

451
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:04,006
Yes, Ethan, exactly.
You don't know who I am right now.

452
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:05,341
'Cause you don't know me at all.

453
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,301
But that's what...
that's what engagement is for.

454
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:08,594
- What?
- You get to know each other.

455
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:11,389
You tell me all the things,
and I tell you all the things

456
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,723
because we love each other.

457
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:13,892
You don't love me.

458
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,684
I do love you.

459
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:19,230
I told my mom and dad about you.
I've never done that with anybody before.

460
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:22,566
They think they're meeting my fiancée
at the gala tomorrow.

461
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,237
Well, that was really premature.

462
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,328
Is there somebody else?

463
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:36,205
- What? No.
- Are you seeing somebody else?

464
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:37,123
No.

465
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:40,626
Okay, well, then I don't see
what else could have changed this much

466
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:41,669
since yesterday.

467
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:44,630
Okay. Yesterday, you found out
that I was a poor kid from Buffalo,

468
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,048
and you got more interested in me,

469
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:50,219
so you... you could be this white knight
galloping in to rescue me.

470
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,055
That is so insulting. And wrong.

471
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,141
It turned you on.

472
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:55,642
No.

473
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:59,520
It made me want to...
It made me want to take care of you more.

474
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,189
- Okay.
- It... It made me...

475
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:02,982
love you more.

476
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:07,195
Also, yesterday,
I hadn't seen my father in, like,

477
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:09,947
God...

478
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:10,990
...a decade.

479
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,326
Not since we faced each other in court,

480
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:18,498
and he lost custody of me due to
criminal negligence and child abuse.

481
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,511
Well, I didn't know that.

482
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,763
Yes, you did.

483
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,724
Yes, you did, Ethan.

484
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,392
You did. Devon said, "Foster care."

485
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:42,272
I said, "Please, don't make me
talk about something so painful,"

486
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:45,650
and you said, "Let's put a ring on it."

487
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:48,945
Wow.

488
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:50,947
Wow.

489
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,371
You think my boss
is getting dumped up there?

490
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:00,831
- For sure.
- For sure.

491
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:04,084
He was already toast.
Simone eats men up and spits them out.

492
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:05,878
Hey, don't talk about her like that.

493
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:08,464
Come on, you remember Ellis,
Drew's little brother?

494
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:09,965
Dumped this dude on his birthday.

495
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:13,260
He got a bunch of face tattoos
and OD'd at a Wendy's.

496
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:15,638
That wasn't Simone's fault.
He was an addict.

497
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,681
No, but then she fucked
that married professor.

498
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,017
Ruined that guy's life too.

499
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:20,935
Oh, yeah.

500
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:23,188
That wasn't her best moment.

501
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:27,108
- Can I help you, little man?
- Yeah, I just want to talk to Devon.

502
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:30,987
- What for?
- I... I just thought she might...

503
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:33,781
Might what? The fuck out of here, man.

504
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:34,699
Yeah.

505
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:43,375
Come on! Him too?

506
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:48,003
Simone, do you realize how many times

507
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:52,384
I have been voted Most Eligible Bachelor
in New England by <i>N Magazine</i>?

508
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:54,553
Thrice.

509
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:57,638
I am a member of Sankaty Golf Club.

510
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:00,140
That's harder to get into
than the US Senate.

511
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,976
I turned down Katy Perry.

512
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,186
Well, maybe she's still interested.

513
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:07,189
Oh, you think this is funny?
Really? Seriously?

514
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:10,192
You're torturing me
instead of giving me an answer?

515
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:11,193
Answer to what?

516
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:13,905
Are you marrying me? Yes or no?

517
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:15,865
No.

518
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,577
Maybe I've been saying it too nicely,
but no.

519
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:20,911
- Wait, or--
- Deadass.

520
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,454
- Hold on a second. Or...
- No.

521
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:24,082
Or... Or...

522
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:25,874
Okay, we...

523
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,209
...we stay together

524
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:30,546
and work through this pickle
that we're in right now...

525
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:31,463
No.

526
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:35,467
...until we get to a place
where we're both feeling like...

527
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:36,760
- No. Ethan...
- ...let's get engaged.

528
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:39,389
I am going to New York
with Kiki on Tuesday.

529
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,641
But where does that leave us?

530
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,604
What about you, Devon?

531
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:47,980
- What are you like at home?
- She's dope.

532
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,815
- I'm deeply, deeply depressed.
- No.

533
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:52,192
She was prom queen,
captain of the track team.

534
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:53,444
She's being modest.

535
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,030
- Ray, that was 15 years ago.
- This is why she keeps me around.

536
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,948
So I can remind her who she really is

537
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,951
because she ended up getting so serious
after the shit happened.

538
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:01,994
- What shit?
- Nothing.

539
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:03,872
Devon had to take care of Simone.

540
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:06,582
This girl right here
worked full time at Costco.

541
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:09,877
Nineteen years old. Paying for food,
paying for an apartment for 'em,

542
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,838
driving her around, tutoring her,
getting her on the damn honor roll.

543
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:15,007
That's why I make it my personal mission

544
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,759
to make sure
she's got some joy in her life.

545
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,926
Some drinks in my life.

546
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:20,262
Sounds to me like you need a break.

547
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:23,682
Have you given any more thought
to sailing down to Palm Beach with me?

548
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:24,726
Wha...

549
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,858
Unbelievable. Fuck!

550
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:36,528
Hey.

551
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:38,072
Yikes. You okay?

552
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:38,990
Yeah.

553
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:40,574
Um...

554
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:41,617
Where's Bruce?

555
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:43,285
He's up there with Peter.

556
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:45,705
Okay, uh, we need to talk.
Let's go in here.

557
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,166
Stay.

558
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:56,131
God.

559
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:58,009
Uh, Zeus, lights.

560
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,803
- Oh my God!
- Sorry.

561
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:02,304
I couldn't find the lights.

562
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:04,515
Cyrus, remember?

563
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,393
- The photographer from <i>Vanity Fair</i>.
- Yeah, I remember you.

564
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,144
What are you doing in here?

565
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:12,856
Waiting on Michaela. I have proofs
to show her from the shoot.

566
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:15,943
- Oh, she's slammed. Here, I can...
- No, I'll wait.

567
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:18,195
- Okay.
- She needs to see them.

568
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,072
Can you remind her I'm here?

569
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:20,990
Yeah.

570
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:25,704
Okay.

571
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,043
Okay, so...

572
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,337
What's the plan?

573
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:37,381
What's the plan for what plan?

574
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,134
I need you to get Bruce out of here.

575
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:42,845
I don't know why you're saying this
like it's my fault.

576
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:44,471
Your idiot boyfriend got him here,

577
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:46,724
and your idiot boss
just invited him to the gala.

578
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:50,519
No way. He... He cannot come to the gala.
He tried to feel Kiki up before.

579
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,438
Well,

580
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,940
now you know
what I've been dealing with by myself.

581
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:57,152
He's... He's, like, shockingly bad.

582
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:01,448
Is he really shockingly bad?
I've been telling you about it all year.

583
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:04,367
Okay.

584
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:06,952
I can get you
on the first flight out tomorrow,

585
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:09,413
and you can take him
to the guest house until then

586
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,956
so I never have to see him again.

587
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,375
You're not gonna talk to him?

588
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:14,376
No.

589
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:15,295
No?

590
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:17,839
No.

591
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,258
The man hasn't left the block since COVID.

592
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:24,887
He got on a plane
and wore a suit to come see you.

593
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,347
How about... I don't care.

594
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:28,807
Leave him on the rocks.

595
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:33,479
So you just... you don't feel
any responsibility for him?

596
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,317
He didn't feel any responsibility for me
when I was a kid.

597
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:40,153
When I went to school hungry and dirty?

598
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:42,071
No, fuck him.

599
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:44,240
Fuck him?

600
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:45,783
Wow.

601
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:46,826
That's cold.

602
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:51,289
Do you know what happens
to girls in foster care?

603
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,335
You know that I do.

604
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:58,129
He let strangers raise me.

605
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,466
He let strangers abuse me.

606
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:03,926
He did that.

607
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:06,220
He wasn't right after Mom died.

608
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:09,808
Everyone thinks that
I wasn't old enough to remember,

609
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:12,643
but I remember clearly.

610
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,938
The more depressed she got,
the more he ignored her.

611
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:20,067
When she got manic, he'd go to the bar

612
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,320
and leave her for us to handle.

613
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:27,367
He's the reason she killed herself.

614
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:30,954
He's the reason that...

615
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:35,792
He's the reason
that I tried to kill myself.

616
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:41,047
And he'll be the reason
that you kill yourself.

617
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,552
And with all this destructive shit
that you do, Devon,

618
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,179
it seems like you want him to.

619
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:58,605
You know what you sound like?
A crazy bitch who's off her meds.

620
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:01,066
Oh my God.
It's always about meds with you.

621
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,651
Meds, meds, meds. Like, why?

622
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:05,070
I went through your cabinet
and know you're not taking them.

623
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:06,864
No, I don't take them. You know why?

624
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,700
I don't need them anymore.
My doctor titrated me off of them.

625
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:12,953
- Whose doctor? Kiki's?
- No. Dr. Fine.

626
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:16,707
My psychiatrist since, like, 2015.

627
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,376
You can recover from PTSD, you know.

628
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,169
You can create the right tools,

629
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:24,423
find your people,
create a safe space for yourself.

630
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:27,050
And I'm not your safe space
anymore, right?

631
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,136
Is that right?

632
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:31,764
Because you are
literally only alive because of me.

633
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,017
I'm alive in spite of you.

634
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:38,062
You want me to be a toddler
with a broken wing.

635
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:40,355
So you have a purpose.

636
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:42,774
- So you can blame your shitty life on me.
- That's bullshit.

637
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:44,652
I didn't even want to tell you

638
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:46,904
that I went off them,

639
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,114
because I knew it would upset you.

640
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:51,451
Do you have any idea how that feels?

641
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:54,454
To know that you don't
actually want me to be well.

642
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:03,046
I have spent my entire life

643
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,256
taking care of you.

644
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,092
You don't want my help anymore?

645
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,054
Good fucking luck.

646
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,196
Don't follow me.

647
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,962
Pretty sweet up here.

648
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:47,840
Bird's-eye view for the king.

649
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:49,676
Thanks.

650
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:51,969
So, did...

651
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:55,390
...you earn your money,
or were you born with it?

652
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,058
- A little of both.
- Mmm.

653
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:01,103
Making money is easy
once you've got money.

654
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:03,147
The easiest thing is to spend it.

655
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:04,816
Hmm.

656
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:08,444
I was never good at making money

657
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:10,863
or anything else.

658
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:14,701
But I do bowl a 220, so there's that.

659
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:18,912
I think there are things other than money
that make a man feel satisfied.

660
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:20,415
Oh yeah? Like what?

661
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,334
Kids. Accomplishments.

662
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:25,545
I'll take the cash.

663
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,715
But you can't take it with you, though.

664
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:33,719
You can't bring all your riches
and accomplishments with you.

665
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,305
That's the one place
you and me are equals.

666
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:39,392
Gotta face death alone.

667
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:44,021
I've built companies
that employ thousands.

668
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,814
I have funded their lives.

669
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:49,276
I give more to charity in a month

670
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:52,113
than most people will earn
in their lifetime.

671
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:57,117
None of that matters when my time comes?

672
00:33:57,118 --> 00:34:01,539
Maybe to the people you leave behind,
but you'll be too dead to give a shit.

673
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:04,667
What about family?
That matters, doesn't it?

674
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,920
If you can remember them.

675
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,797
Mmm.

676
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:13,676
But when I die, I just want to be present.

677
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:17,180
Have my memory

678
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,390
and remember.

679
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:27,482
And... what do you want to remember, Bruce,

680
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:29,524
in those final moments?

681
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:30,943
My girls.

682
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,571
Devon and Simone.

683
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:34,906
Yeah.

684
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,324
Yeah.

685
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,326
Rory and Sarah for me.

686
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:41,704
And their mother, Andrea.

687
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,626
God, she was beautiful.

688
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:51,756
I'm still in love with her.

689
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,425
She ruined me, though.

690
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:56,594
Shipwrecked me.

691
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:58,721
Made me lose my kids.

692
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,058
Yeah, I know how that can happen.

693
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:06,854
Let me have some of that.

694
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,148
I haven't had that since the Navy.

695
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:13,026
Okay, but just... a small hit

696
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:16,364
because this legal stuff is pretty strong.

697
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,247
Go away!

698
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:28,543
- She said go away! She means you!
- No, she's talking about you, Popeye.

699
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,920
- Hey, you need help getting up?
- No!

700
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,713
Stop. I just want to be alone.

701
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:36,049
Okay, well, I brought you a flask.

702
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:39,386
I brought you my sweatshirt.
It's warm from my body heat.

703
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:42,264
- "It's warm from my body heat." Dork!
- Okay, calm down, nurse.

704
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,474
- Here. Ladies first.
- No, thank you, Ray.

705
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:47,561
- Don't worry, it's not Captain Morgan.
- I said no. I don't drink anymore.

706
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:48,603
Since when?

707
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:52,023
Since all year. Since I got my first DUI.

708
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:56,027
I've told you, like, 40 times I'm trying
to be sober. You never listen to me.

709
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:58,405
Are these guys bothering you, Devon?

710
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,407
Oh, Jesus Christ.

711
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:03,034
- What is wrong with you guys?
- Hold on.

712
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:04,704
- Hey, wait. Devon.
- Hey!

713
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:07,622
- Devon! Hold on, wait. Wait.
- Come on, D, wait!

714
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:10,167
Let go of me. Where's Devon?

715
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,836
Hey, Michaela,
can I get a little help over here?

716
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,755
- Bruce is freaking out.
- What's the matter with him?

717
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:18,258
I don't know. We were having
a nice conversation, smoking weed,

718
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,467
and he got a little agitated.

719
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:21,219
Maybe you shouldn't have gotten him high.

720
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,179
Where am I?

721
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,347
What happened?

722
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,348
Where's Devon?

723
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,559
Uh, I think she went out
for a walk, Bruce.

724
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,560
Who are you?

725
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:29,561
I'm Simone.

726
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:31,105
No, you're not. She's dead.

727
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,443
I'm gonna get a paper bag
and do the breathing thing.

728
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:39,864
- Um...
- I need my medicine. Where's Devon?

729
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:43,033
Where's my TV?
I want to watch the Indians game.

730
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,368
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay.
It's okay. Just calm down.

731
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:47,246
Don't you fucking touch me!

732
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:50,415
Go... Go find Devon, all right?

733
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:51,834
Check the guest house.

734
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,419
We're gonna find Devon
for you, Bruce, okay?

735
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,088
I don't know what this is.
I'm not supposed to be here.

736
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:59,799
Hey. Hey.

737
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,010
- Do you remember me?
- Mmm.

738
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:02,511
Hmm?

739
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,847
- Hi.
- Hi. Hi.

740
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:07,182
- Hi.
- Hi.

741
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,475
- I know you.
- Yes.

742
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,143
We met.

743
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:12,354
We're gonna find Devon for you, okay?

744
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:13,939
- Hold my hand.
- Yeah.

745
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,607
- Let's hold hands, all right?
- Okay.

746
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:18,735
We're gonna sit down and wait for Devon.
Come on. Come on.

747
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:19,987
Come on.

748
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,156
He said he'd smoked before.

749
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,076
Hey.

750
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,410
How was I supposed to know you were sober?

751
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:30,205
Last time I saw you,
you were wasted at Whiskey Joe's.

752
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:33,083
When you left me so drunk
I couldn't stand. Is that the night?

753
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,169
- You said you were gonna call an Uber.
- Yeah.

754
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,213
I didn't.

755
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,839
I fucked the bartender.

756
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,968
And then I drove drunk and crashed
into a parking meter, got arrested,

757
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,345
and spent the night in jail.

758
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:48,223
No. What? Why didn't you call me?

759
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:52,687
You were busy yelling at me
about some fucking Falafel Ball shift.

760
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:56,482
Could you just give us a second, please?

761
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,528
Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

762
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:06,241
No, don't... don't do that. Don't pretend
that you care about me. You went home.

763
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:09,411
You know that I have to go home
to my wife sometimes.

764
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:11,663
That does not mean that I don't love you.

765
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:12,664
You don't love me.

766
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:16,585
You love who you were in 2009.
You love high school.

767
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,754
I don't understand why you're negging me,

768
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:22,882
because I... I closed the restaurant early.

769
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:26,386
I... I lied to my whole family
so that I could come see you.

770
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:28,139
You knew that I wasn't okay.

771
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,392
And you left me there anyway.

772
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:34,894
Go home to Allie.

773
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:37,147
But I'm leaving her. I am.

774
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,816
I'm gonna break the news to her
sometime, like, next week.

775
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:42,403
I don't want you to leave Allie.
I don't want you.

776
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,154
Why?

777
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,948
Because of that guy?
I know it's not that guy.

778
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:48,283
Because I don't love you.

779
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,076
I've fucked three guys
since I've been here.

780
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,369
You don't mean anything to me.

781
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:53,747
I don't think about you.
I don't even like you.

782
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:57,000
You make my life worse. You make me worse.

783
00:38:57,001 --> 00:39:01,880
And you're the thing that I do
when I want to hate myself.

784
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:05,551
If you walked into the ocean right now
and drowned, I would be better off.

785
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:25,070
Everything is okay, Bruce.

786
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:27,989
Just relax.
We're getting in touch with Devon.

787
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,991
- Hey, beautiful.
- Yeah?

788
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:32,994
You want to get out of here?
This house is weird.

789
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:34,288
I know.

790
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:37,665
- I'm just not quite ready to leave.
- Mmm.

791
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:39,251
Can we wait a little bit?

792
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,587
- I want to move around.
- Oh. Uh...

793
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:44,172
- Okay. Um...
- Yeah.

794
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:45,924
Bruce, come back. No, come back.

795
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:47,967
Hey, you know what? We could dance.

796
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,178
- Dance? What do you mean?
- Yeah, I like to dance.

797
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:51,596
- Come on.
- No. There's no music.

798
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:53,515
Put your arms around me. Take a breath.

799
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:57,102
- No, there's music in the... in the surf.
- Hmm.

800
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:58,812
Mmm, listen. Listen.

801
00:39:58,813 --> 00:39:59,980
Listen to the waves.

802
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:07,238
We were so good together.
Why did you leave?

803
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:10,908
I'm here now.

804
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,703
Huh?

805
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:18,832
Am I lost, or is this real?

806
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,000
Does it matter?

807
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:23,671
You feel so good in my arms.

808
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:25,797
I won't fail you again.

809
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:26,756
You didn't fail.

810
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:29,676
Everything I tried,
it just made you sadder.

811
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:32,762
I didn't know that you were at that point.

812
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:35,099
There was nothing you could have done.

813
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:37,143
I was mean to you.

814
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:41,897
I got angry when you were in your moods.

815
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:43,941
Pissed off.

816
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:47,027
You were up buzzing around all night,

817
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,447
bursting with words.

818
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:50,990
Dancing.

819
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,617
Music no one else could hear.

820
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:55,952
Can you hear it now?

821
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:56,871
Yeah.

822
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:58,830
Hmm.

823
00:40:58,831 --> 00:40:59,790
I hear,

824
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:01,292
I think.

825
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:06,881
You tried to kill Simone.

826
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,633
I couldn't understand that.

827
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,263
That is very hard to understand.

828
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:23,230
I tried so hard for so long
to get pregnant.

829
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:25,483
- You did?
- I did.

830
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:29,777
I kept trying, losing,

831
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:31,238
and trying and losing.

832
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:37,953
Our daughters turned out so smart,

833
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:39,914
beautiful.

834
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,626
I wish you could see them now.

835
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:47,171
I wish I could see my babies too.

836
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,134
I'm tired.

837
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,594
Yeah?

838
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:54,928
Mmm.

839
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,472
- Mm.
- My legs.

840
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:58,973
Why don't we sit down again?

841
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:00,434
- Mmm.
- Come on.

842
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:04,313
Come on, sit over here.

843
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:07,774
Maybe I'll close my eyes for a bit.

844
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,360
That's a good idea.

845
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,491
Ah, here you go.

846
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,084
Hey.

847
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:29,254
There you go, buddy.

848
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:30,339
Rest now.

849
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:32,633
Mmm.

850
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,768
<i>Devon!</i>

851
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:45,104
Devon!

852
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,651
Go away, monster!

853
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:53,112
Ethan?

854
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,907
Ethan, what are you doing out here?

855
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:00,118
Me, I'm teleport--

856
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:02,997
I'm teleporting to my boat to come get me.

857
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,416
- Beam me up!
- Okay.

858
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,209
You're drunk. Let me walk you home.

859
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:09,627
You stay away from me.

860
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:11,547
I'll help you home, okay?

861
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:15,717
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

862
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:17,510
Uh-huh, yeah.

863
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:21,181
I'm just another notch
on your little pink belt, right?

864
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:23,851
Fine, you can get yourself home.

865
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:25,311
Devon!

866
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:28,814
- You're a monster, you know that?
- Stop calling me that.

867
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:33,234
Monster.

868
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:35,571
Hey. You're gonna hurt yourself, okay?

869
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:38,699
You're a shell of a person.

870
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,035
I see it now.

871
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:43,787
Little beady eyes over there.

872
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:47,333
Destroying me.

873
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:51,086
You stay away from me.

874
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:07,353
There you go.

875
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:14,443
Nice job in there.

876
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:17,237
I didn't know what to do.

877
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:23,201
Yeah, what a day.
Can't believe we have the gala tomorrow.

878
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:24,244
Hmm.

879
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:30,376
I'm sorry that we never...
got to have a baby, Michaela.

880
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:35,589
I'm sorry too.

881
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:42,054
I know that this year
has been hard for you.

882
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:45,682
Rory and his wife announcing
that they were expecting,

883
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:49,687
but there's something that...
I need to tell you.

884
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:53,314
Uh...

885
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:55,651
When I said I was in Japan,

886
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:58,445
I was actually
at my grandson's christening.

887
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:02,700
Rory was there, of course, and Sarah too.

888
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:05,160
I was with my kids.

889
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,204
I know.

890
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,249
Simone told you?

891
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:12,500
No, why would Simone know?

892
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:14,168
Oh, I don't know.

893
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:15,253
Um...

894
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:17,839
Nothing gets by that girl.
I... I thought she figured it out.

895
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:21,135
No, I... I figured it out by myself. I...

896
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:23,594
I was hurt that you didn't tell me,

897
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:25,973
but I understand
why you feel you couldn't.

898
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:27,391
You do?

899
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:31,186
You knew I'd be upset. Your kids hate me.

900
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:33,604
They always have, you know?

901
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:36,859
They blame me for what happened
with Jocelyn. I'm the villain, right?

902
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:42,030
But I want you to have
a relationship with your kids.

903
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:45,576
I'm glad you saw the baby.

904
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,959
- Can I tell you something cool?
- Hmm.

905
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,546
When Rory saw me, he started to cry.

906
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:00,381
- He did?
- Yeah.

907
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:03,134
He was just so surprised.

908
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:06,345
And then Sarah came over,
and she started crying, and then the baby,

909
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:08,557
his name's Jonathan,
he started crying. It was funny.

910
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:12,311
I'm so relieved because I thought
you were having an affair.

911
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:18,442
We've been through a lot, you and me.

912
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:23,655
I love you, Mrs. Kell.

913
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:26,408
I love you too.

914
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:43,383
Stop following me!

915
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,929
Ethan, get away from the cliff.

916
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,889
Help! Somebody help me!

917
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:51,350
I'm trying to help you.

918
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:54,561
Oh God.

919
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:57,773
You did this to me.

920
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:00,651
You!

921
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,529
- You did this!
- Ethan?

922
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:10,451
- Help!
- What is it?

923
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:12,537
Help! Ethan fell off the cliff
the whole way down.

924
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:13,454
Oh my God.

925
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:16,375
Call 911. Meet the ambulance out front.

926
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:20,628
Hi. I need an ambulance
at 4 Sconset Point.

927
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:23,047
A man fell from the bluff. I...

928
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:24,382
I don't know.

929
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:26,092
Yes. Thank you.

930
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:27,927
Excuse me. Excuse me.

931
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:30,888
I'm so sorry. I've been waiting
in that hot room for three hours.

932
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:33,307
Cyrus, I... I can't talk now.
There's been an emergency.

933
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:35,810
- I need to speak to you.
- I cannot look at proofs now.

934
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:38,313
You need to see this photo, ma'am.

935
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:45,612
When did you take this?

936
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:47,030
Today.

937
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:50,074
I was shooting Kewes Point
for your feature.

938
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:51,993
I'm sure the magazine
would want to buy it.

939
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:53,412
You'll get your money.

940
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:54,746
Please leave.
