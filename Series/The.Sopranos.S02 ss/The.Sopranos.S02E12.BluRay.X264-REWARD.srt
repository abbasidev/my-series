(BALLROOM DANCE MUSIC)

3
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,463
Had some great naps on this.

4
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:13,006
- You okay?
- Sure.

5
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:18,095
Shades of Starving Students,
Santa Monica, Summer of '78.

6
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,596
- You were a mover?
- Yeah.

7
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:23,725
- How many jobs you had?
- Enough to know I don't want another.

8
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:28,647
- These floors have wonderful glide.
- You're looking great, Rick.

9
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:32,067
Beautiful, Juliet, beautiful!

10
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,155
Richie's son is still flying
down to Rio?

11
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,949
- Dad must be proud as punch.
- He is.

12
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,911
Those two made top 10 in the
Embassy Ball Championships last year.

13
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:45,205
Ton! Hey, man.

14
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,333
Jackie! How's your rash?

15
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:51,253
How you doing?

16
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:52,921
You want a beer, T?

17
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:57,718
No, no. That's all right.
Go join your wastrel friends.

18
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,224
What's the matter?

19
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:06,518
Jackie Aprile loved knowledge.

20
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:10,898
When he was dying of cancer, he prayed
his son would go to medical school.

21
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,817
If he knew he dropped out of college,
break his heart.

22
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:17,112
It didn't hurt The Beatles,
Bill Gates.

23
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,615
His Uncle Richie's looking out for him.

24
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:24,661
- Easier than dealing with his own son.
- Tony, don't do that.

25
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,831
He's taking AJ
to the dirt bike championships.

26
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,960
- AJ can't go. He got a C in Algebra.
- Does Carmela know about this?

27
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,838
You really want to know?

28
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,799
- I don't want him around my kids.
- Richie?

29
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:41,637
- You heard me.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

30
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:45,265
- Ask Gia Gaeta.
- Richie told me all about that.

31
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:48,185
The transmission slipped out of gear.

32
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,479
He's lucky he wasn't crushed too.

33
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:54,983
For your information, Beansie Gaeta
owed major dollars for 10 years.

34
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,153
- And Richie didn't ask for interest.
- Why not?

35
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:02,991
If we're so awful, why throw
us an engagement party?

36
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:06,954
Because you're my sister.
And I try to do what's right.

37
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,747
Anyway, it's my wife's thing.

38
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:11,416
Include planking
that Russian girl of yours?

39
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,335
You know what? Be in denial.

40
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,672
Be a codependent to a shitbag.
What the fuck do I care?

41
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:20,592
You just can't stand to see me happy,
can you? You motherfucker.

42
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,844
Shove that settee up your ass.

43
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:34,106
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

44
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:03,468
I love my new pony boots, Tony.

45
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,436
Yeah, nice.

46
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:17,024
Why don't you wear them
during your interviews?

47
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,193
Feel, Tony, how soft.

48
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:25,574
You call Sy Littman yet?

49
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,451
No, I'm doing it.

50
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:32,080
There's good money in modeling.

51
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,834
You don't want to spend the rest
of your life at a department store.

52
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:39,755
- What do you care what I do?
- Don't start with the moody shit.

53
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:46,094
- What is that?
- Chicken Soup for the Soul.

54
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:49,097
Read "Tomato Sauce for Your Ass,"
the Italian version.

55
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,310
Somebody give me this I met at work.

56
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,064
He drives for Runway Limos,

57
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,858
he broughts Karl Lagerfeld
to the store

58
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,360
for the trunk shows.

59
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,445
Why? You jealous?

60
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,655
You fucking him?

61
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:10,410
- I can't have a conversation with you.
- It's a fucking question.

62
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:14,122
Maybe you ought to think about it.

63
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,834
Finding somebody who can
give you everything you want.

64
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,669
I told you, he drives a limo.

65
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,340
I'm not talking about those things.

66
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:27,511
I'm talking about a family,
marriage, children.

67
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:30,847
I don't want to find someone.
I have you.

68
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,644
To take you out to dinner
and screw your brains out?

69
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,729
What's wrong with you?

70
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,066
Tony, no. Don't go.

71
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,819
You don't know
what the fuck you want!

72
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,530
Don't yell at me, please.
This is a bad time.

73
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,990
My new boss is so mean to me.

74
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,493
It's always a bad time.
With the cousins...

75
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,328
Tony! No, please, no!

76
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,208
Alright.

77
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:05,632
You know it hasn't been good
for a long time. For either of us.

78
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,676
I'll die without you.

79
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,512
No, you won't.
You'll forget about me in two weeks.

80
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:12,931
No, if you go, I'll kill myself.

81
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,852
Don't you fucking threaten me, Rina.

82
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:20,188
This is over.
I can't do this anymore.

83
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,607
I'm not gonna do it anymore.

84
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,277
You talk to that guy
about the modeling.

85
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,030
I'll take care of you
till you get on your feet.

86
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,533
But I'm not doing this anymore.
Understand?

87
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,789
I hate you!

88
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:47,174
So that's it. Albert splits Nutley
with the D'Alessios...

89
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,885
...and Barone keeps
everything north of Paterson.

90
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,220
What else we gotta talk about?

91
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,557
- Fairfield taking bids next week.
- What's there to talk about?

92
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,477
- Fairfield's mine.
- Was yours.

93
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,479
I don't give bids to the handicapped.

94
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,025
Obviously, you're deaf.
I told you 10 times.

95
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,402
I find out you still deal blow
on those routes.

96
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,654
For that I'm losing a fucking bid?

97
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:12,199
Next time you'll be
in back of one of your trucks.

98
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:14,826
- Those were my father's routes!
- Kid.

99
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:18,788
Actually, fellas, my cousin Larry
wants the Fairfield contract.

100
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,417
Being the hardship on his family
while he's awaiting trial.

101
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:25,253
See? This is why we have
a fixed-bid club.

102
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,173
Everyone wants to be at
the head of the line.

103
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:30,175
I been in line for 10 years.

104
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:34,554
He's asking for what my father
would've given if he was boss.

105
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:38,350
It's not because they're brothers. You
respected my father, respect Richie.

106
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:42,395
Those who want respect, give respect.

107
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:47,275
See, he just told you
to shut the fuck up...

108
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,695
...and he told me to go fuck myself.

109
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,537
This bill, Mel. Jesus.

110
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:03,291
I wish this trial would happen.
I'm hemorrhaging spondulicks here.

111
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:08,088
The Minimization Process
could be very good for us, Corrado.

112
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:12,259
We hire experts to study
the wiretap tapes.

113
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,178
Former bureau guys, very thorough.

114
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,848
If they find abuses, we take
those findings to the judge...

115
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,394
...and possibly have all
the wiretap evidence thrown out.

116
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:26,648
I know the feds stay on the phone
longer than the 20 seconds...

117
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:29,818
...they're allowed to see if the call
is relevant. I hear a click.

118
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,987
I could be talking about root beer...

119
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:37,492
...and sometimes they stay on 40, 50
seconds before they hang up. Pricks.

120
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,869
- But it'll cost, the study.
- How much?

121
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,122
Two hundred plus hours of tapes.

122
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:47,002
I want to bring on specialized counsel
to handle the wiretap litigation.

123
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,506
- Ballpark figure?
- Yeah, Wrigley-fucking-Field.

124
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,049
Four hundred thousand.

125
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:59,681
Did my nephew say
where I'm allowed to move the coke?

126
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,683
He don't give a shit about nobody.

127
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:06,730
This country's going through boom
times with more garbage than ever.

128
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,107
- He won't let me eat.
- You want to cry money problems?

129
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:12,110
I'm facing 20 years.
I could die in the fucking place!

130
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:15,030
- You're gonna beat it, skip.
- You don't know that!

131
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,036
- That coke is my lifeline right now.
- Break it down, Jun.

132
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,454
What choice does he give?

133
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:25,040
We need allies to do
what you're thinking about.

134
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:27,626
Albert Barese didn't like
what he was hearing.

135
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:31,921
And by extension, Larry Barese.
Biggest fucking crew in the family.

136
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,509
That doesn't surprise me.

137
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:43,266
Larry's thought about why he's
under indictment and others ain't.

138
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:47,646
- What do you want me to do?
- Go talk to Ally Boy. Feel him out.

139
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,232
But he's a slippery fuck.
Don't commit.

140
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,032
I'll see you.

141
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:07,374
He's got tremendous moxie
for his size.

142
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:11,294
Tell me about it. He's a fighter.

143
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,519
- What's this?
- Open it.

144
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:32,190
No, I can see it's J.W. Gold.
But we can't accept gifts, Sal.

145
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,317
I'll pass it to the guys.

146
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:36,361
See? That right there.

147
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:40,156
You've a policy you stick to.
You don't get distracted.

148
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:44,536
Look what happened to those Egyptians.
Those World Trade Center fucks.

149
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,288
Serial numbers on an axle
and everyone behind bars.

150
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,499
What the fuck is all this?

151
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:56,005
I owe you, skip. The rest of my life.
I'll never forget.

152
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,133
You looked the other way
on that Bevilaqua beef.

153
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:01,636
The bureau would never turn
its head on a murder charge.

154
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,513
What else could you say?

155
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:08,309
- What do you know about Scottsdale?
- Arizona?

156
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:11,062
I'll live there when
this assignment is over.

157
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,732
- Assignment?
- When I'm in Witness Protection.

158
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:18,903
There's more than 300 days of sun,
golf, Giant's spring training.

159
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,823
I'm talking about
after two years in Lewisburg.

160
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:25,160
I think I'll take courses
while I'm in the can.

161
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,203
Psychology, criminology.

162
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,748
Give lectures
at police departments on OC.

163
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,167
That's an idea.

164
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,881
An airline ticket
from the Scatino bust-out.

165
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,718
Tony made a guy order blocks of these
through his sporting goods store.

166
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,680
I'll put it on file.

167
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,932
You could use it as cause
for a warrant.

168
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:51,770
Evidence of extortion, intent to
defraud. Those are RICO predicates.

169
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,648
First, you have to tie
the ticket to Tony.

170
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,777
And he's too smart to use
any of them himself.

171
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,820
He probably moved them by now.

172
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,451
However, this engagement party
for the sister?

173
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:09,078
I'll wire you up.
I know you're sensitive...

174
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:13,541
- What the fuck was I, his errand boy?
- The Saturn, yeah.

175
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,294
Looking for his kid's teacher's car.

176
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:20,381
What is that? Any faith I had
went out the window that day.

177
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,154
(POP SONG PLAYING)

178
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,741
- It's gorgeous.
- I know.

179
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,785
Are you out of your mind
with the arrangements?

180
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,912
No, my planner
did Cerone's wedding.

181
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,998
All I do is I hand out money.
I have his card for you.

182
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,960
Your father disappeared,
and I ain't paying for that.

183
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,504
Oh, Carmela.

184
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,215
Carmela, I love the new wallpaper.

185
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:03,675
Should I do my den?

186
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,511
Do you have that guy's number?

187
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:11,558
You got any of those airline tickets
from the Scatino bust-out?

188
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:15,019
- Fucking creep.
- Who, Rich?

189
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:19,691
What happened to that man in the can?
Meadow? Go help your mother.

190
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:26,656
You're in a bit of denial.
Richie was a disturbed kid.

191
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:30,451
So, Janice. I really don't have
a shot anymore?

192
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:36,124
- Having a good time?
- What do you want me to say?

193
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,377
I'm sorry. I'm glad for you.

194
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:44,591
You should've seen Ma.
She really wanted to be here.

195
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,676
Can we go back to where
I was glad for you?

196
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:49,304
You know, you don't give her
a chance, Tony.

197
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,515
She's a completely different
person since Prozac.

198
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,225
Since what?

199
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:55,268
Janice.

200
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:07,405
You're not gonna believe this shit.
They got the old lady on Prozac.

201
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:08,907
"She's changed," my ass.

202
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,993
She's just too senile
to remember who she hates.

203
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:16,789
- What's wrong with you today?
- What do you care?

204
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,543
(CLANKING GLASS)

205
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,046
Go, Richie!

206
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,382
C'mon, speech.

207
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,051
Everybody...

208
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,014
I want to thank my future
in-laws for making a great party.

209
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:36,601
And I want to thank
you all for coming...

210
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:40,980
...and celebrating with us
this historical union...

211
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,484
...of the Apriles and the Sopranos.

212
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,320
They say it's never too late...

213
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:51,407
...and they say all good comes
to those who wait.

214
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:54,744
Right on both counts.

215
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:03,586
- You got anything to add, Ricky?
- Glad for you, Dad.

216
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:04,712
Aw.

217
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,674
- Stepmom.
- Thanks, Rick.

218
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:08,549
Umm...

219
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:15,056
Well, I just wanted to share
my happiness with everybody here.

220
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:20,019
And I have been looking
for my soul mate for all of my life.

221
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,106
Madonna, have I looked, right?

222
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:28,444
I don't know what made me think I'd
find anybody in an ashram in Pradesh.

223
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,030
But I...

224
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,950
I found him right here.

225
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:36,411
At home.

226
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:41,874
And I just wanted to say
that you knock my socks off.

227
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,669
(APPLAUSE)

228
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,671
God bless, Salut.

229
00:16:57,224 --> 00:17:00,727
(CHEERING)

230
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,566
(PHONE RINGING)

231
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,074
Yeah?

232
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,286
It was delicious agony.

233
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:21,289
Are you also pretending
when I kiss you?

234
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,460
I gotta go out.

235
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,379
(FEMALE)
Oh, you're wonderful.

236
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,882
I'm ashamed of myself.

237
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,676
Yes, you ought to be, definitely.

238
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:37,972
I'm in the shower.
I almost didn't hear the phone.

239
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:41,768
She's drunk, she's crying.
She took 20 sleeping pills!

240
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,603
What the fuck did she think?

241
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,730
- It's not her fault.
- Please.

242
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,231
She has hard life.

243
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,442
You got one leg.
You're not like that.

244
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:52,153
Her parents were alcoholics...

245
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:55,114
...in Petrozavodsk.
Horrible, industrial city.

246
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:58,826
The father died, 55 years old.

247
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:02,371
Lung cancer, cirrhosis of the liver.
Good thing.

248
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:06,167
Anyway, he was not working.
The factory was closed down.

249
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:11,380
She had to go to Kazakhstan to live
with uncle. Rude, miserable man.

250
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,104
Jesus Christ, Rina.

251
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,523
I don't care no more what happen.

252
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:33,361
- You got your whole life ahead of you.
- So sorry, Tony.

253
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,989
The ambulance, emergency room.

254
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,491
How she gonna pay?

255
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:41,702
They don't give her insurance
in that department store.

256
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:43,704
I'll take care of it.

257
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:47,416
What kind of life is there
for me without you, Tony?

258
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,379
To go back to Bada Bing.

259
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:55,341
To be a dancer,
be a prostitute after that?

260
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:58,678
I don't want to. I don't want to!

261
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:01,514
All right. All right.
Shh, Shh, Shh.

262
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,725
Everything's gonna be all right.

263
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,394
Okay?

264
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,062
It's gonna be all right.

265
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:11,816
Perfect.

266
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:16,195
Oh, God, look at that cleavage.

267
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,698
Thank you, Jesus.

268
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,534
I'm only doing this for the presents.

269
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,077
I'm doing it for Richie.

270
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:27,790
He says he'd rather go to Vegas, but
you gotta do the ritual thing, right?

271
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,793
This is such a happy time.

272
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:34,005
All the flowers, all the excitement.

273
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,174
I remember how I felt.

274
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:39,093
Then there's the honeymoon
and the hope chest.

275
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,262
You're working overtime here.

276
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:44,140
Remember how radiant I looked?

277
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:48,936
- You're depressed, aren't you?
- Depressed? I leave that to others.

278
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,189
I'm just realistic.

279
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:55,776
Because in a year, tops,
you're gonna have to accept a goomar.

280
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:57,570
Oh, yeah?

281
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:01,282
Is there a goomar that lets him
hold a gun to her head when they fuck?

282
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:03,951
You let him hold a gun
to your head during sex?

283
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:07,622
If that gets him off. It's the same
as garter belts and uniforms.

284
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:11,626
Well, it's a gun, Janice.
I thought you were a feminist?

285
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:16,088
- Usually, he takes the clip out.
- Well, Jesus, I hope so.

286
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:20,218
It's a ritual. It's fetishistic.
That's all.

287
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,891
My 302 from last week.

288
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:29,185
Sure. Come on in.

289
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,773
- Happy birthday, chief.
- Thanks.

290
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,318
From Tony Soprano.

291
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:40,029
Never misses an occasion.

292
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,657
Christmas, Columbus Day.

293
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,493
Have something to eat before I send it
to St. Ambroseus Shelter.

294
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,745
My CW gave me a bottle
of Johnnie Walker.

295
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,248
- CW-16?
- Bompensiero, yeah.

296
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:52,750
Fucking guy thinks I'm his friend now.

297
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:57,255
We're not supposed to accept gifts,
and poor people will get this...

298
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:00,258
...but I can't resist the lard bread.
He's turned some corner.

299
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:05,054
One minute he talks about how he loves
Soprano, then he's a junior G-man.

300
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:07,598
Talking about RICO predicates
and probable cause.

301
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,351
Now we're the good guys.

302
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,063
It's the worst case of Stockholm
Syndrome since Patty Hearst.

303
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:15,898
That was sad.

304
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,401
I'll tell you, though...

305
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,779
...I'm worried about Sal, with these
fantasies of law enforcement.

306
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:27,535
This can work two ways, skip. You
can find yourself getting too close.

307
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:38,212
So you're getting married.
Settling down, eh?

308
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:42,174
One door opens, another door closes.

309
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:45,970
It's a fucking expensive
proposition, though.

310
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,222
I didn't need that shit the other day.

311
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,266
You don't need that shit.

312
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,601
You talk to the king of dermabrasion
about it?

313
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:56,564
I'm talking to him and he's looking
at his reflection in the Plexiglas.

314
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:02,069
Imagine getting a face-lift,
and one week later you're in jail.

315
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:05,740
Can you imagine that?
One week later you're in jail.

316
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:12,455
Anyway, I had the feeling you
didn't like what you were hearing.

317
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:15,249
Larry expected to get fucked.

318
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:19,587
- Now that's a sad commentary.
- Richie.

319
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:22,340
What'll Larry do? The guy's
a guest of the government.

320
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:26,135
- While some are stuffing themselves.
- Some people are stuffing themselves.

321
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,471
Larry's got a trial coming up.

322
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:30,765
He's in no position to go
into the unknown not knowing.

323
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:34,685
How about you, Albert?
You can weigh in anytime.

324
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,313
I'm with him.

325
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:41,484
- All things being equal?
- No.

326
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:45,363
Make a move against Tony Soprano?
No way.

327
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,531
I don't know what to tell you.

328
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:50,409
(BANGING NOISE)

329
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:05,633
Vic?

330
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,511
Carmela, hi.

331
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:11,680
Imagine running into you here.
How are you?

332
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:14,767
Good. I'm fine. And how are you?

333
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:16,477
- Good.
- Yeah.

334
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,729
Just shopping for a roller.

335
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:31,033
Look, Vic, truthfully, I'm not just
running into you here.

336
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:34,412
The name of the store's on your
supplies. I wanted to talk.

337
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:38,499
- I'm sorry. I should've called.
- You have nothing to be sorry for.

338
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,418
I should've told you I wasn't coming.

339
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,837
I got the message
when you didn't show up.

340
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:47,341
That's why I wanted to talk to you.
I wanted to thank you.

341
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:49,176
For what?

342
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:52,513
Maybe someday I will be free.

343
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:57,226
But if you had come that day,
I might have done something...

344
00:23:57,477 --> 00:24:00,229
...that I would be sorry for forever.

345
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:04,608
I wanted to thank you
for thinking for the both of us.

346
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,570
For being strong for us both.

347
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,031
Thank you.

348
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:13,701
Well, you're welcome.

349
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:21,500
Goodbye, Vic.
And take care of yourself.

350
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:38,601
Oh, thank Christ! Jesus!

351
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:42,271
Do you know who she's married to?

352
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,942
I need the number of a good shrink.

353
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:48,986
Oh?

354
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,613
For a girl I was seeing.

355
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,240
What?

356
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,411
Was?

357
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,663
Yeah, she tried to kill herself.

358
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:01,957
This was no small cuttings.

359
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,877
This was 20 Halcion
and a quart of vodka.

360
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:08,422
The ambulance, they pumped her
stomach. Cost 3 grand.

361
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:11,550
She should've been seen
by the psychiatrist in the hospital.

362
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:15,221
He was a Romanian. They have some
beef that goes back centuries.

363
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:16,847
She wouldn't talk to him.

364
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:19,767
Do you feel responsible
for her suicide attempt?

365
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:21,769
I was banging her for two years.

366
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:25,940
- Was that a hardship on her?
- That's cute.

367
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:32,571
I've had many women.
Why can't I say "Fuck it" with her?

368
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:34,156
Why do you think?

369
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:36,784
Well, she's a sweet kid
underneath it all.

370
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:39,703
I think she's seriously depressed.

371
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,540
You feel for her.

372
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:47,795
I'm interested in why
you're ending it.

373
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:50,172
What do you mean, why?

374
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:54,468
Isn't that what I'm supposed to do?
Don't you tell me that all the time?

375
00:25:54,678 --> 00:26:00,140
I've never passed judgment on your
sex life or any patient's sex life.

376
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,394
Even if I'm 20 years older
than her and I'm married.

377
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,146
What's wrong with you?

378
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:09,984
- Why now?
- Why now?

379
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,530
It's not fun anymore. Will you
recommend somebody or not?

380
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,620
He's eating lunch.

381
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:30,588
So?

382
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,172
Larry's out.

383
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:35,384
Oh, shit. Fuck!

384
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:39,054
I knew it, I fucking knew it!

385
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:41,640
Here, Bobby, take this. I can't eat.

386
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:46,020
Larry and Albert are not the problem.

387
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,939
It's Tony that's the fucking problem.

388
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:52,693
You take him out of the picture,
everybody's gonna come along.

389
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:55,529
- Where else are they gonna go?
- I'm sick.

390
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,823
And fucking Larry Barese too.

391
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:01,785
I got friends in federal holding
that would like nothing better...

392
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:03,746
...than to take that weak fuck out.

393
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:06,373
He was a great friend to my father.

394
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:10,252
But he doesn't care who he
follows now. I'd do him myself.

395
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:13,130
Who's that speaking?
Is somebody speaking?

396
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,050
Listen, Richie.

397
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:22,306
Let me think about this. But we can't
be too fucked up by this setback.

398
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:25,643
We gotta screw our courage
to the post.

399
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:35,152
- You're a good boy, Richie.
- It's gonna be good.

400
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:38,364
Go on home. We'll talk.

401
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:56,090
Fucking guy's fearless for his size.

402
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,425
That's nice.

403
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:03,472
Then what? He fucking dies
and I can't even wear his shoes.

404
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:07,810
- What the fuck you talking about?
- Fucking loser. He couldn't sell it.

405
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,061
Richie?

406
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,771
Pay attention. You may learn.

407
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:16,944
Who am I best off with?
We best off with?

408
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:26,328
Old man Profaci knew how
to split his enemies.

409
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:30,916
He couldn't fucking sell it.

410
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:34,670
He's not respected.

411
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:41,552
But Tony with his impulsiveness
and selfishness.

412
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:44,805
He's locked up in that fucking
head of his.

413
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,396
I'm better off with Tony.

414
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:56,984
Definitely.

415
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:00,904
I want to see Anthony
at the doctor's office tomorrow.

416
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:09,246
- What are you looking at?
- I'm in awe of you.

417
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:15,335
The Dow Jones Industrial average
gave back an earlier gain.

418
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,838
It rallied more than
100 points midday.

419
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:21,175
But in the end it fell
two and a half to close at 10,675...

420
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:24,344
- Hard at work?
- It's financial news.

421
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,096
What the fuck you doing here?

422
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,559
I got a line on a car for Adriana.

423
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:33,187
You want anything?
They got sodas, coffee.

424
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,730
I got a bottle.

425
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:40,068
- No, I'm good. How's it going?
- This racket?

426
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:44,907
We dumped Webistics, whacked up
the payoff. Fucking license to steal.

427
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:47,659
- Anything you can get me into?
- A pharmaceutical.

428
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:51,872
They got a root from the Amazon,
cures glaucoma.

429
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:56,210
It's all fucking bullshit,
but I got a brochure.

430
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:59,171
Oh, tonight, Puss,
I got something hard-edge.

431
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:01,256
- What?
- Pokémon cards.

432
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:04,009
Me and Tommy Mac are
taking down a truckload.

433
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,928
- Where?
- Tommy knows. You in?

434
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:08,263
- What, me?
- Yeah, come on, old times.

435
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:11,016
You don't want a fat fuck
like me around.

436
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:14,561
I can't find the brochure.
What difference does it make?

437
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,397
You come in for 5, 10 grand
on this drug company.

438
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:21,860
By the time we dump the piece of shit,
you'll be in six-figure territory.

439
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,863
- Hey, Puss!
- Yeah?

440
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,949
- The fucking car?
- What car?

441
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,452
Oh, yeah, right. For Adriana.

442
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:34,790
It's an M3 convertible. Clean.
I'll keep you posted.

443
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:40,087
(PHONE RINGING)

444
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:42,506
You're kidding. Shoot.

445
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:44,299
Lipari.

446
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:46,093
- This is fat man.
- Who?

447
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:47,761
- You know.
- Sal?

448
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:52,057
I heard they're gonna jack
a load of these Pokémon cards.

449
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:53,976
Moltisanti and another individual.

450
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,727
- Where?
- I don't know yet.

451
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,145
I should ascertain?

452
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,023
Excuse me, dear.

453
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:07,072
You are a cooperating witness.
You wear a wire, that's what you do.

454
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:09,950
You ask around,
see what you can find out.

455
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,828
I, in no way, want you
to go on any hijack.

456
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,080
You hear me?

457
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:18,750
We let you earn,
but no violent crimes. Right?

458
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,252
Okay.

459
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:26,341
Get out of here! I hate you,
you fucking bastard!

460
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,176
(IN RUSSIAN)
I told him this was not a good time.

461
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,095
Fucking mood swings.

462
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:33,599
(IN RUSSIAN)
Ssh. Ssh. Is all right.

463
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,351
- Was very bad day for her?
- When isn't?

464
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:41,106
I went to the modeling agency. I
waited four hours to see Mr. Littman.

465
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:42,399
- So?
- Wasn't good.

466
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,359
So she didn't get a job. Big deal.

467
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:45,819
It was catalogs there.

468
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:48,864
To be a model for catalogs for
salad spinners.

469
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,282
You start somewhere.

470
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:53,285
I went in to see him,
and he told me I am too old.

471
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,330
Oh, Jesus.

472
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,708
- I'm sorry.
- I go make the tea.

473
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:03,962
I told you. I told you
it's all over for me.

474
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:06,131
No, it's not.
You're gonna be fine.

475
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:08,175
Look at Svetlana,

476
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:11,219
her prosthetic leg fall off in
the Gap store

477
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:14,139
and her Bill picks her up
and carries her.

478
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:17,684
Where is my knight in
white satin armor?

479
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:22,814
Listen, I got the number...

480
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:27,027
...of a guy I want you to talk to.

481
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:30,530
I don't want to go
to no more fucking interviews.

482
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,743
It's not an interview. It's a shrink.

483
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,245
- A shrink?
- Yeah, a psychiatrist.

484
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:38,997
I know what is!

485
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:42,334
He comes highly recommended.
You'll feel better.

486
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:45,337
- I am not going to no shrink!
- Yeah, you are.

487
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,757
- It's what I want you to do.
- You're not the boss.

488
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,261
You know what? Go fuck yourself then.

489
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:56,556
I went to a lot of trouble
to get that number.

490
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:58,892
So you can send me
to a hospital?

491
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:03,188
Psychiatrist is very scary thing for
Russian. Means being sent to Gulag.

492
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:06,566
- Political rehabilitation.
- This is too fucked up for me.

493
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:07,901
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

494
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,070
- What?
- Kiss off, then.

495
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:22,457
Janice! How do you open this Advil?

496
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:25,377
Oh, never mind.

497
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:30,424
Dad, I'm gonna get started
on your gutters tomorrow.

498
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:31,550
That's great.

499
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:35,012
Take a look at this.
I picked it up yesterday.

500
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:39,725
It's very Bauhaus. And it's not bad.
The basics cost 20 thousand.

501
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:42,894
Janice, maybe you should slow down
on the spending for now.

502
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,647
Something wrong? What happened?

503
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:48,483
I'll take care of it.
Things could be fucked up.

504
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:52,404
If something's happening
to you, then it's happening to me.

505
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:57,534
A decision went against me which
impacts me a great deal, financially.

506
00:33:57,785 --> 00:34:00,662
Fuck! You see, fuck, I knew it!

507
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:03,415
This shit's been building
since I got out.

508
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:07,210
You give him a jacket you treasure.
He gives it to his maid.

509
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,963
We're still going ahead
with the house?

510
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,256
We'll see.

511
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:14,801
Richie, they're tiling the pool
on Friday.

512
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,262
And the atrium window,
I'm gonna lose a deposit!

513
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:18,972
I said, I'll take care of it.

514
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:24,686
He can't handle that our house will
be nicer than his fucking house!

515
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,107
Fuck.

516
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:31,068
What's the matter with you?

517
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:33,779
Nothing.

518
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:37,115
- What?
- Nothing. I just...

519
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:41,078
It's just sad is all.

520
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:44,206
- What?
- AJ didn't have the flu.

521
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:47,751
He didn't go because Tony
wouldn't let him.

522
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:51,046
He doesn't want you around his kids.

523
00:34:57,011 --> 00:35:00,555
What happened? What was that?

524
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:12,651
Searchlight Diner, 5:15 a.m.

525
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:18,031
Subject has still not left location.
Sun coming up.

526
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:35,549
5:16 a.m. Subjects departing
Searchlight Diner.

527
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,330
(HONKING)

528
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:38,904
(PHONE RINGING)

529
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:42,407
- Soprano residence.
- Is Tony there?

530
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:45,285
- May I ask who's calling?
- Just put him on.

531
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:48,997
- Who's calling please?
- What are you, that Polish maid?

532
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:51,124
I want to talk to Tony.

533
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,126
(IN RUSSIAN)
Who is this? The Russian whore?

534
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,420
You're not the first one you know.

535
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:58,548
Put him on the fucking phone,

536
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,675
you bearded Polack hag.

537
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:01,426
It's for you.

538
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:03,136
- Hello.
- Tony.

539
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,013
I miss you.

540
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:08,600
- I love you.
- You got the wrong fucking number.

541
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:10,852
Don't call here again.

542
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,568
I'll wait out there.

543
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,112
Was that your Russian girlfriend?

544
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:25,992
Listen, it's over between us.
It has been for a very long time.

545
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:29,621
Bullshit! Why does your clothes
still stink of perfume?

546
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,251
Okay, I saw her.

547
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:37,629
But it's not what you think.
She tried to commit suicide.

548
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:39,047
Oh, fuck you!

549
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:44,302
She tried to kill herself. She didn't
want to go on without me, poor kid.

550
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:49,349
You're putting me in a position
where I feel sorry for a whore?!

551
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:54,020
You know what's even stranger?
For a second, I believed you.

552
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:00,902
Goddamn him!

553
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:04,030
- They're all the same, Carm.
- No, you know they're not.

554
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,324
That man who did my wallpaper.

555
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:10,328
There was a male person
that you could respect.

556
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:15,000
Victor? He didn't show up that day
because of who your husband is.

557
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:18,670
Face it, use your head.
He pissed his pants.

558
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:23,008
I don't want to go to the gym.

559
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:33,643
Better be good. I'm in the middle
of World War III over there.

560
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:37,772
When you're lying in your own blood,
don't say your uncle didn't warn you.

561
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:41,192
- What are you talking about?
- Richie Aprile's moving against you.

562
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:45,030
- He doesn't have the balls.
- He's got a legitimate beef with you.

563
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:47,198
You're high-handed with everybody.

564
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:50,577
Why don't you leave your opinions
wherever the fuck?

565
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:54,247
He approached Albert Barese.
And Albert said no.

566
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,126
- Albert told you this?
- No.

567
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:01,046
I got it from Richie himself
at my house.

568
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:05,800
He'll take you out and Larry Barese
and anybody who doesn't go along.

569
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:09,054
Wait. Why the fuck is
Richie telling you all this?

570
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:11,181
He thinks I'm with him.

571
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,432
Really?

572
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:17,437
- What gave him that idea?
- It's what I wanted him to believe.

573
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:20,190
I been playing him.
I seen this coming all along.

574
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:23,151
That's why I made a big deal
out of that coke.

575
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,403
I raised a nonissue
and he fell for it.

576
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:29,574
So you're like a double agent now?
Fucking Matt Helm?

577
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:30,992
Fuck you.

578
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,831
How do I know you're not playing me?

579
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:41,127
Believe what you want,
my little nephew.

580
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:45,757
If I didn't come to you,
your children would have no father.

581
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:48,718
So go fuck yourself.

582
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:57,477
All right, stop.

583
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,358
I'm grateful to you.

584
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:04,609
I am.

585
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:09,572
I gave you five percent on the action
that was left to you.

586
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:12,992
Kick it up to seven and a half.

587
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:18,164
Don't sell drugs on those routes.
It's short-sighted.

588
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:37,684
- That asshole's marrying my sister.
- You wonder where she is in this.

589
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:39,853
My little niece.

590
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,778
What's up, T?

591
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:54,409
My future brother-in-law's
a serious problem.

592
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,327
How serious?

593
00:40:56,579 --> 00:41:00,874
He's dissatisfied with the leadership.
He wants to have me popped.

594
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:04,627
That motherfucker.

595
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:07,547
So now I gotta decide
what to do about him.

596
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:25,523
I genuinely don't think
there's anything to gain...

597
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:27,775
...by keeping him around.

598
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,198
Get it done.

599
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:44,042
The planner checked the almanac...

600
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:48,630
...and says there's 65% historical
chance of rain on the twelfth.

601
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:52,175
He wants to get a tent for backup.
What do you think?

602
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:57,388
I can't decide on shit like that,
Janice, come on.

603
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:01,559
Okay. But when you start bitching
when you see the bill, don't.

604
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:05,772
My kid hit me up for 5 grand today
to go to England...

605
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:08,233
...for these dance contests.

606
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:10,109
Little Ricky's coming to the wedding?

607
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:13,988
Rick. Rick. Richard.

608
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,074
How many times I gotta tell you?

609
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:18,576
It was Little Ricky
when he was 12 years old.

610
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,371
Jesus, all right!

611
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,417
But he's still coming?

612
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:31,089
He wouldn't miss an opportunity to fox
trot and tango in front of everybody.

613
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:35,176
- Ballroom dancing is a legitimate art.
- He carries my name.

614
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:39,722
Richard. Fucking disgraziato.

615
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:44,477
My nephew Jackie.
Why couldn't I have a son like that?

616
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:49,107
You know, you came home
with a fucking attitude today.

617
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:52,694
I've been in this house,
cooking your fucking dinner...

618
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:55,655
...and taking care of that
black hole upstairs all day!

619
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:58,408
Keep your voice down.
She hears everything.

620
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:01,035
Not tonight.
I gave her two Nembutals.

621
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:04,539
I thought maybe we'd want to have sex.
But not likely.

622
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:07,458
Put my dinner on the table,
and keep your mouth shut.

623
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,544
No, you shut up.

624
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:12,797
Since he's a ballroom dancer,
you think he's gay.

625
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:15,466
What if he was?
What difference does it make?

626
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:19,345
Ow.

627
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:27,812
Fuck.

628
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:47,707
What are you looking at?

629
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:52,170
You gonna cry now?

630
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:06,768
Get out of here.
I'm in no mood for your...

631
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:13,941
Shit.

632
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:39,217
- Where is everybody?
- AJ is upstairs, Meadow's out.

633
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,345
(PHONE RINGING)

634
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:47,558
You better get it.
Maybe she slit the other wrist.

635
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,147
- Hello?
- Tony?

636
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:57,318
I need you. I need you
to come over now. Okay?

637
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,070
What's the matter? Is it Ma?

638
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:01,406
No. No.

639
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:04,784
- Tell me what happened.
- No, I can't say...

640
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:08,121
- What do you mean, you can't say?
- No, I can't say now.

641
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,081
Think. Think a minute, okay?

642
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:13,710
Stay there. I'll be right over.

643
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,172
- It's Janice.
- Right.

644
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:20,091
I gotta go.

645
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:31,561
(SOBBING)

646
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:47,285
(DOOR OPENING)

647
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:55,334
- Janice.
- Ton?

648
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:58,880
Ton, he hit me.

649
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:01,591
It was an accident.

650
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,970
Baby.

651
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,060
Where's Ma?

652
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:16,314
She's upstairs. Out.

653
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:19,734
She took two Nembutals.

654
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:22,236
Ma?

655
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:26,824
I didn't mean it, Tony.
I didn't mean it.

656
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:31,829
Where's the gun?

657
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:34,957
In the cabinet.

658
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:58,439
If anybody calls this in,
you don't gotta talk to anybody.

659
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:03,528
- What are you doing?
- Take a shower.

660
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:05,279
Give me the clothes you got on.

661
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:14,997
- What the fuck, Sal?
- They got away.

662
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:18,125
What did I tell you? Huh?
What did I tell you?

663
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:20,837
I didn't go with them. I was
following them to the boost.

664
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:24,006
- Then I was gonna call you.
- What if they would've spotted you?

665
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:28,219
The Moltisanti kid and his friend.
What was your plan for that?

666
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:32,265
That was the beauty part.
I switched cars with my son.

667
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:34,433
You hit a fucking 7-11 clerk.

668
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:36,727
- How is he?
- In a coma.

669
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:37,520
Fuck.

670
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:41,107
They were gonna pinch you for leaving
the scene, but I got you out of it.

671
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:43,150
I owe you, again.

672
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:46,904
Sal, listen to me.

673
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:51,075
No, look at me. Look up.

674
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:54,245
You are not an FBI employee, Sal.

675
00:47:55,831 --> 00:48:00,126
- Okay? That's not gonna happen.
- But I got a lot to offer.

676
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:04,463
I hate LCN. I know I misspent
most of my life, I know that.

677
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:07,758
I know fucking well we live
in a society of laws...

678
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:13,097
Sal, you are gonna help us build
a case against Tony Soprano.

679
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:16,017
Then you're gonna do
your time for selling heroin.

680
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:18,769
Then you get out
and start a new life.

681
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:21,606
It's a good thing.
It's a lucky thing.

682
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:25,359
Sal...

683
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:28,112
...don't be that way.

684
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:30,698
I can show you statistics.

685
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,419

686
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:55,556
Whoa.

687
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:59,268
I know, but we don't got time
for that.

688
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:01,771
Get him out of here. Get rid of him.

689
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:04,273
Bring his car to the salvage crusher.

690
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:07,026
Cadillac.

691
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:08,861
I'll get something.

692
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:10,363
(PHONE RINGING)

693
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:15,326
Hello.

694
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:27,880
Where are you going? No, Tony!
Please, don't go.

695
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:29,507
I'll be right back.

696
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:41,310
(ELECTRIC SAWING SOUNDS)

697
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:53,948
We gotta speed this up. You know what
time these humps come in for work?

698
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:56,617
Fucking meat delivery at 5 a.m.

699
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:59,036
We're almost done.

700
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:03,082
It's gonna be a while before I eat
anything from Satriale's.

701
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:07,586
Uh, Okay.

702
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:12,049
Get the hose and wash the room.

703
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:18,139
(LIVIA)
Janice? Is that you down there?

704
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:20,516
What are you doing up so early?

705
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:23,102
Ma, go back to bed.

706
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:27,732
I just don't know what happened to me.

707
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:30,818
I had the strangest dreams
all night long.

708
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:34,572
People coming and going
and coming and going.

709
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:36,866
I couldn't get up off the bed.

710
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:40,619
Ton... Tony.

711
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:43,122
Anthony, what are you doing here?

712
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:47,001
Nothing. Janice, let's go.

713
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:51,589
Richie didn't come home.
She's worried.

714
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:55,426
Oh, sure, he probably jilted her.
It's the story of her life.

715
00:51:00,932 --> 00:51:05,227
What kind of a fucking chance did she
have with you as her mother?

716
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:07,938
You're always nagging her
about her weight.

717
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:10,983
She goes out on a date,
you call her a tramp!

718
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:12,943
I'm gonna wait out in the car.

719
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,113
- I never said anything of the kind.
- I heard you.

720
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:18,616
You make things up.

721
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:20,618
You tell me.

722
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:25,247
Now you tell me when I ever did
anything to any of you.

723
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:28,375
You don't know, do you?

724
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:32,797
You don't have a fucking clue.

725
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:36,383
I wasn't always perfect,
but I always tried to do the best.

726
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:44,183
I know you didn't, any of you, didn't
like it when I told you what to do.

727
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:50,648
Babies are like animals.
They're no different than dogs.

728
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:54,443
Somebody has to teach them
right from wrong.

729
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:59,323
But I was your mother!
Who else was gonna do it?

730
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:04,995
If you ask me, I did
a pretty damn good job.

731
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:10,292
That palace you live in
up there on that hill.

732
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:19,426
I gave my life to my children
on a silver platter.

733
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:24,056
I suppose now you're not
gonna kiss me.

734
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:26,767
What?

735
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:30,437
You're cruel, that's what you are.

736
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:35,901
- Oh, fuck this.
- Oh, don't... No.

00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:57,673
(IN RUSSIAN)
Irina, a man is here to see you.

740
00:52:57,883 --> 00:52:58,757
Who?

741
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,050
The one who has the club.

742
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:00,968
Mr. Dante.

743
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:10,603
- How you doing, hon?
- Who sended you, Tony?

744
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:12,062
He asked me to bring this.

745
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:16,233
- What is it, money? I don't want it.
- Yes, you do.

746
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:19,570
There's $75,000 in here.

747
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:22,156
- Seventy-five?
- Listen...

748
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:27,161
...Irina, I know you're upset.
But let me give you a little advice.

749
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:31,749
In my business I see girls
come and go. So I know.

750
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:37,254
Time is the great enemy.
You've got a very short window.

751
00:53:37,505 --> 00:53:41,508
It's not good to get too hung up
on any one thing.

752
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:45,137
On the other hand,
something new always comes along.

753
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:50,184
I've seen it a million times.
It's called Passages.

754
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:51,227
It's a book.

755
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:54,438
He's right, Irinushka.
He's very smart man.

756
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:23,550
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

757
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:32,726
I'm not gonna forget this, Tony.
I owe you. God, do I owe you.

758
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:36,981
All in all, I'd say
it was a good visit.

759
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:40,859
What's wrong with our family, Tony?

760
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:44,405
I go to a shrink.

761
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:50,869
She says that our mother has
a narcissistic personality.

762
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:56,083
- Who knows how she got that way.
- Grandpa Vito was no prize as a father.

763
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:59,211
That's not all the shrink says.
She says...

764
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:06,135
...that Ma is a person who was
incapable of experiencing joy.

765
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:08,679
Dad, all he did was experience joy.

766
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:11,724
Richie told me you were going
to a shrink.

767
00:55:11,933 --> 00:55:14,893
I used to suggest it,
and you'd blow your stack at me.

768
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:18,314
Maybe you ought to think about
going back into therapy.

769
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:20,482
What'd you do with him?

770
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:23,610
We buried him.

771
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:25,738
On a hill.

772
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:29,450
Overlooking a little river.
With pine cones all around.

773
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:31,577
- You did?
- What the fuck?

774
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:35,289
What do you care what we did with him?
Why do you want to know?

775
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:38,042
But I loved him so much!

776
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:40,419
You're gonna miss your bus.

777
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:45,924
I'm sorry, Tony. I am so sorry.

00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:49,261

Well, what about Richie?
He must be devastated.

787
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:49,947
Richie's gone.

788
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:51,824
What do you mean "gone"?

789
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:53,909
Gone.

790
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:55,994
Where?

791
00:56:57,747 --> 00:57:02,793
After 18 years, don't make me
make you an accessory after the fact.

792

An accessory after the...?

- Stop asking.

I took care of it.

you go for three weeks?
