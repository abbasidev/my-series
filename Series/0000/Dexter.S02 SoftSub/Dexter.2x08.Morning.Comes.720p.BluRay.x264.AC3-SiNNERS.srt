1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,317
<i>Previously on Dexter...</i>

2
00:00:03,718 --> 00:00:06,374
My mother was murdered
when I was a boy.

3
00:00:06,865 --> 00:00:08,487
I was there. I saw it.

4
00:00:08,703 --> 00:00:10,661
3 men were arrested
for those murders.

5
00:00:10,856 --> 00:00:13,363
One's deceased,
one's doing life without possibility,

6
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,575
and that's the only one that's still
an open case, Santos Jiminez.

7
00:00:16,761 --> 00:00:17,873
1972 !

8
00:00:18,723 --> 00:00:20,896
Did you have to saw her
into little pieces ?

9
00:00:21,098 --> 00:00:22,981
Did you have to leave two little boys

10
00:00:23,121 --> 00:00:25,527
soaking in a pool
of their mother's blood ?

11
00:00:26,343 --> 00:00:28,110
I don't care what you did.

12
00:00:28,921 --> 00:00:29,954
It's okay.

13
00:00:32,843 --> 00:00:35,801
- Who the fuck are you ?
- Pardon my tits.

14
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,666
How could you do this to Rita,
not to mention her kids ?

15
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:40,925
Rita broke up with me, okay ?

16
00:00:41,669 --> 00:00:45,336
'cause when you're around, I kind
of feel like I can deal with anything.

17
00:00:58,129 --> 00:01:00,767
Your past is a bigger mystery
than fucking Jimmy Hoffa.

18
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:03,211
<i>It's time to make Doakes go away.</i>

19
00:01:10,854 --> 00:01:13,337
Sergeant Doakes
is on administrative leave

20
00:01:13,553 --> 00:01:16,062
pending an internal affairs
investigation.

21
00:01:17,021 --> 00:01:19,101
The killer's making us chase our tails.

22
00:01:19,363 --> 00:01:22,354
- You know what that means ?
- That he might be one of us ?

23
00:01:24,695 --> 00:01:27,235
I was working on my piece,
and it just caught fire.

24
00:01:27,515 --> 00:01:30,142
I was so scared.
Promise me that you won't

25
00:01:30,377 --> 00:01:32,491
leave me, that you won't go anywhere.

26
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,711
I'm not going anywhere.

27
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,611
I can't believe he said it.
Even for Masuka, it was too much.

28
00:03:36,652 --> 00:03:40,095
And Batista didn't do anything.
Talk about lame, he fucking sat there.

29
00:03:40,171 --> 00:03:43,752
- You know how much I wanted to...
- Is that the sports section ?

30
00:03:45,514 --> 00:03:49,725
<i>I used to enjoy quiet mornings,
but ever since the fire at Lila's loft,</i>

31
00:03:49,802 --> 00:03:52,026
<i>she's been crashing here
a bit too often.</i>

32
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:54,510
- Is that my shirt ?
- I thought it was Dex's.

33
00:03:54,672 --> 00:03:55,772
It's not.

34
00:03:57,532 --> 00:03:59,802
It's okay... keep it.

35
00:03:59,842 --> 00:04:02,675
<i>And so now I share the kitchen
with a cobra and a mongoose.</i>

36
00:04:02,716 --> 00:04:04,783
Somebody drank all the coffee again.

37
00:04:04,823 --> 00:04:06,824
Somebody didn't drink all the coffee.

38
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,955
I had a cup, Dexter had a cup,
and it just kind of went like that

39
00:04:10,105 --> 00:04:11,950
until the pot was empty.

40
00:04:12,363 --> 00:04:13,772
- Deb, please.
- What ?

41
00:04:13,922 --> 00:04:16,326
Someone didn't drink all the coffee.
Stupid question.

42
00:04:16,485 --> 00:04:20,040
- Why are you sticking up for her ?
- I'm just trying to keep the peace.

43
00:04:20,513 --> 00:04:22,750
Maybe we should stay
at your place tonight.

44
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,773
Has the fire damage been repaired ?

45
00:04:24,815 --> 00:04:27,023
The insurance company's
dicking me around.

46
00:04:27,063 --> 00:04:28,931
- Won't pay me.
- Don't worry.

47
00:04:28,982 --> 00:04:31,511
- I'll move out soon.
- Stop leeching off your brother ?

48
00:04:31,587 --> 00:04:34,707
- Whatever for ?
- Again, thanks for sticking up for me.

49
00:04:34,747 --> 00:04:37,767
- I am Switzerland.
- Yeah, and I'm out of here.

50
00:04:45,726 --> 00:04:46,873
What's this ?

51
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:51,137
It's the dragon zombie.

52
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:55,555
- Cody likes to hide things in my bag.
- He's trying to control you.

53
00:04:55,947 --> 00:05:00,437
By hiding toys in your bag, you have
no choice but to return them to him.

54
00:05:00,972 --> 00:05:04,705
He's 7. He seldom has thoughts more
complicated than the desire for candy.

55
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:08,107
I'll see you at your loft tonight.

56
00:05:12,838 --> 00:05:13,938
Honey !

57
00:05:14,312 --> 00:05:15,548
Honey, no.

58
00:05:16,545 --> 00:05:18,667
You said we could make breakfast.

59
00:05:19,154 --> 00:05:22,133
- I meant cereal, baby.
- I don't want cereal.

60
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:29,118
<i>I guess I should give Rita back
her key.</i>

61
00:05:35,815 --> 00:05:37,979
Cody, no.
No, let mommy get the d...

62
00:05:38,062 --> 00:05:39,407
It's Dexter !

63
00:05:39,447 --> 00:05:41,706
- He brought doughnuts !
- I did.

64
00:05:41,752 --> 00:05:44,495
I also brought... A dragon zombie !

65
00:05:44,535 --> 00:05:46,438
I knew you'd find it !

66
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,115
Hope it's okay I'm here.

67
00:05:51,092 --> 00:05:55,508
Could you watch them while I finish
getting ready ? Astor still has homework.

68
00:06:03,462 --> 00:06:04,939
Thank you, Dexter.

69
00:06:07,084 --> 00:06:08,684
Meet me at the car.

70
00:06:11,714 --> 00:06:13,544
Good thing I dropped by.

71
00:06:14,227 --> 00:06:15,731
Don't ever do it again.

72
00:06:18,034 --> 00:06:19,962
- Sorry ?
- It's too hard on the kids

73
00:06:20,026 --> 00:06:21,549
and it's too hard on me.

74
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,529
It's Paul all over again.

75
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,809
Please, Dexter, just stay away.

76
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:38,602
Notice we have some new faces.

77
00:06:38,642 --> 00:06:40,235
Please make them feel welcome.

78
00:06:40,295 --> 00:06:43,305
Our immediate task
is to re-examine every criminal case

79
00:06:43,466 --> 00:06:45,069
involving our 18 victims.

80
00:06:45,126 --> 00:06:48,176
- Where would you like us to start ?
- By answering every question

81
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:50,664
as honestly and with as much
detail as you can.

82
00:06:50,866 --> 00:06:52,215
Excuse me, sir.

83
00:06:52,556 --> 00:06:55,037
- Answering questions ?
- That is correct.

84
00:06:55,086 --> 00:06:57,807
I can hardly expect you to investigate
your own cases.

85
00:06:57,847 --> 00:06:59,476
What are you saying ?

86
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,888
Are we under investigation ?

87
00:07:01,986 --> 00:07:03,641
We're now operating assuming

88
00:07:03,718 --> 00:07:06,440
that our killer is somehow connected
to law enforcement.

89
00:07:06,497 --> 00:07:09,097
Whether he be a file clerk,
a dispatch officer,

90
00:07:09,194 --> 00:07:11,290
- park ranger...
- Or a police officer.

91
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,272
Or a police officer.

92
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,733
Is that why you brought in
all these suits ?

93
00:07:15,915 --> 00:07:17,316
Special agents.

94
00:07:17,392 --> 00:07:21,161
Sir, you risk alienating every cop
on the task force if you do this.

95
00:07:21,378 --> 00:07:23,629
We go where the chase leads us...

96
00:07:24,234 --> 00:07:25,911
Even if it gets messy.

97
00:07:32,415 --> 00:07:33,792
It's insulting.

98
00:07:33,842 --> 00:07:36,750
We're as capable as they are
of looking into our own cases.

99
00:07:36,807 --> 00:07:39,692
Who wears a wool suit
in the middle of summer in Miami ?

100
00:07:39,769 --> 00:07:42,330
Nazis. That's who.
It's all about intimidation.

101
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:45,570
And the idea that one of us could be
the killer is complete bullshit.

102
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,579
What do you mean ? "us" who ?

103
00:07:48,781 --> 00:07:51,455
Lundy has his feds
investigating all of our cases

104
00:07:51,617 --> 00:07:55,001
that are tied to the Bay Harbor victims.
That's good here.

105
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,870
We gotta stand tough here.
We gotta make it clear to them

106
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:03,175
that we're not gonna be their little
"yes, sir, no, sir" lapdogs.

107
00:08:05,826 --> 00:08:07,024
Gentlemen.

108
00:08:07,103 --> 00:08:09,589
I'd like to go over
some of your cases tomorrow.

109
00:08:09,631 --> 00:08:11,168
Got them listed there.

110
00:08:11,245 --> 00:08:15,367
It would be helpful if you could
gather up any notes you may have taken.

111
00:08:15,737 --> 00:08:17,011
Happy to help.

112
00:08:21,059 --> 00:08:23,468
- Way to stand tough, Dexter.
- Sorry.

113
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:26,522
That's exactly how Hitler walked.

114
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,922
<i>It seems my manifesto unintentionally
helped Lundy narrow his focus.</i>

115
00:08:36,066 --> 00:08:40,025
<i>That's what I get for trying
to emulate Lila and take the offensive.</i>

116
00:08:40,109 --> 00:08:44,265
<i>I've always worked best in the shadows,
and that's where I have to stay.</i>

117
00:08:44,793 --> 00:08:47,089
Lundy's really pissing people off.

118
00:08:47,684 --> 00:08:50,846
He's got his whole crew
looking through every case

119
00:08:50,886 --> 00:08:53,163
involving any
of the Bay Harbor victims.

120
00:08:53,214 --> 00:08:56,582
- He sounds desperate.
- You know you're gonna be called in.

121
00:08:56,651 --> 00:08:59,097
I'll be curious to see if I show up.

122
00:08:59,398 --> 00:09:02,714
Okay, James,
you need to be a little careful here.

123
00:09:03,116 --> 00:09:05,592
If you wanna keep your job,
you gotta cooperate.

124
00:09:05,632 --> 00:09:08,577
Being on suspension
does not exclude you from this.

125
00:09:08,617 --> 00:09:11,838
And who was it that suspended me again ?
Oh, shit ! That was you.

126
00:09:11,878 --> 00:09:14,837
Please, don't act
like you didn't deserve it.

127
00:09:15,499 --> 00:09:17,847
Your case is coming up for review
in a week.

128
00:09:17,887 --> 00:09:20,480
- If you wanna keep your job...
- You keep saying that.

129
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,989
What makes you think
I wanna keep my job ?

130
00:09:23,758 --> 00:09:25,598
Are you just talking here,

131
00:09:25,675 --> 00:09:28,363
or is this something
that you've seriously considered ?

132
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:32,707
Well, you and I both know that I've gone
as high as I can over there.

133
00:09:32,747 --> 00:09:34,697
Maybe it's time to move on.

134
00:09:35,655 --> 00:09:37,454
Well, what would you do ?

135
00:09:38,425 --> 00:09:39,808
I don't know.

136
00:09:39,886 --> 00:09:43,242
My father was a butcher.
Maybe I'll open up my own butcher shop.

137
00:09:43,338 --> 00:09:47,007
Yeah, I can just see you
putting on an apron every morning.

138
00:09:48,967 --> 00:09:50,733
Look, I have a friend.

139
00:09:51,116 --> 00:09:53,875
He's the head of personnel
at Stillwater security.

140
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,368
Government contractors.

141
00:09:55,424 --> 00:09:57,662
They're always looking
for people like you.

142
00:09:57,816 --> 00:10:01,291
It's a dangerous world out there.
They pay a lot of money to make it safe.

143
00:10:01,348 --> 00:10:03,231
Yeah, you got that right.

144
00:10:03,346 --> 00:10:06,270
Alright. Set it up.
I'll meet with your guy.

145
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:09,693
Officer Morgan.

146
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:11,627
Yes ?

147
00:10:11,747 --> 00:10:14,796
I picked the Rodrigo case for you
to look into.

148
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,918
Small-time dope dealer.
Arrested for murder

149
00:10:18,473 --> 00:10:21,965
ended up walking free, then disappeared
off the face of the earth

150
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:25,237
until his body was found
in a garbage bag in the ocean.

151
00:10:26,264 --> 00:10:28,266
Not exciting enough for you ?

152
00:10:30,233 --> 00:10:31,881
I'm homicide. I mean,

153
00:10:31,977 --> 00:10:34,828
I thought you didn't want us
checking into our own cases.

154
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:36,368
You're new to homicide.

155
00:10:36,425 --> 00:10:40,187
At the time of this case, you were
still in vice. No conflict there.

156
00:10:40,316 --> 00:10:43,218
I'm flattered you want me in
on this, but...

157
00:10:43,586 --> 00:10:46,253
Batista and Doakes were lead here.

158
00:10:46,341 --> 00:10:49,379
I feel kind of weird about investigating
my own colleagues.

159
00:10:49,429 --> 00:10:51,012
"Weird". Gosh.

160
00:10:51,306 --> 00:10:53,406
I'd hate for you to feel weird.

161
00:10:54,345 --> 00:10:55,994
You know what I mean.

162
00:10:59,881 --> 00:11:02,567
Would you have dinner with me
tomorrow night ?

163
00:11:03,714 --> 00:11:05,837
Or would that make you feel weird ?

164
00:11:09,772 --> 00:11:12,031
I'd love to have dinner with you.

165
00:11:12,709 --> 00:11:13,809
Good.

166
00:11:14,287 --> 00:11:16,759
I'll take you to the best restaurant
in Miami.

167
00:11:18,004 --> 00:11:19,104
Great.

168
00:11:33,524 --> 00:11:35,070
I like the smell.

169
00:11:35,524 --> 00:11:36,640
Don't you ?

170
00:11:37,283 --> 00:11:39,893
Like something exciting happened here.

171
00:11:40,087 --> 00:11:43,247
It's like when a piece of bread
gets stuck in the toaster.

172
00:11:43,323 --> 00:11:46,568
You like to pretend
there's no poetry in you.

173
00:11:47,724 --> 00:11:50,902
So, what's the problem
with the insurance company ?

174
00:11:52,288 --> 00:11:53,644
It's ridiculous.

175
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:57,680
They think the fire
is of suspicious origin,

176
00:11:57,822 --> 00:12:00,444
and they need to finish
their investigation.

177
00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:02,203
What do they mean,"suspicious" ?

178
00:12:02,266 --> 00:12:04,707
Are they saying
you started the fire on purpose ?

179
00:12:04,747 --> 00:12:06,797
Who knows what they're saying ?

180
00:12:07,086 --> 00:12:11,264
You know insurance companies.
Anything to keep from paying out.

181
00:12:18,175 --> 00:12:21,435
<i>Especially when a fire
has multiple points of origin.</i>

182
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:26,668
So, you never told me.

183
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:30,464
How did it go at Rita's this morning ?

184
00:12:31,386 --> 00:12:33,962
You know, I just returned Cody's toy,

185
00:12:34,247 --> 00:12:35,464
and that was it.

186
00:12:35,616 --> 00:12:38,002
No quickie on the kitchen table ?

187
00:12:38,086 --> 00:12:40,277
Rita doesn't have a kitchen table.

188
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,167
Clever way of not answering
the question.

189
00:12:43,327 --> 00:12:44,438
It was...

190
00:12:45,987 --> 00:12:47,437
Awkward, actually.

191
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,471
Always is.

192
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,437
You can't go back. You know that.

193
00:12:54,589 --> 00:12:56,689
I'm not trying to go anywhere.

194
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,467
The bed's all ready.

195
00:13:01,067 --> 00:13:03,444
- I can't.
- And why would that be ?

196
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,959
I have too much work to do.

197
00:13:08,098 --> 00:13:10,781
I have all these case files
I have to go over for tomorrow.

198
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,920
You didn't bring any work with you ?

199
00:13:13,115 --> 00:13:14,274
At home...

200
00:13:14,964 --> 00:13:17,183
I need... work at home.

201
00:13:19,901 --> 00:13:21,337
Goodbye, then.

202
00:13:22,322 --> 00:13:24,037
So, I'll see you tomorrow ?

203
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,004
Whatever.

204
00:13:44,789 --> 00:13:47,884
<i>Is it possible she started that fire
on purpose ?</i>

205
00:13:48,181 --> 00:13:49,660
<i>I can't imagine why.</i>

206
00:13:49,717 --> 00:13:53,190
<i>What I do know is
that I can't take any risks right now.</i>

207
00:14:08,477 --> 00:14:11,626
- At least, you wanted to...
- Morgan ! Come in.

208
00:14:12,215 --> 00:14:14,083
Can I offer you some tea ?

209
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:16,994
No, thank you. I'm...

210
00:14:17,034 --> 00:14:18,759
<i>And he pours it anyway.</i>

211
00:14:18,946 --> 00:14:20,886
<i>He's trying to throw me off balance,</i>

212
00:14:20,968 --> 00:14:24,167
<i>show that I don't have the power
to say no to him.</i>

213
00:14:24,819 --> 00:14:27,146
How about some sesame crackers
to go with that ?

214
00:14:27,286 --> 00:14:29,827
<i>So I'll say yes to everything.
I'd love some.</i>

215
00:14:32,812 --> 00:14:34,813
Sorry. Guess I ate them all.

216
00:14:36,226 --> 00:14:37,326
<i>Asshole.</i>

217
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:41,547
So,

218
00:14:42,498 --> 00:14:44,762
You worked firsthand on, what,

219
00:14:44,835 --> 00:14:48,078
four of the cases related
to the Bay Harbor investigation ?

220
00:14:48,155 --> 00:14:49,490
I believe so.

221
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:53,094
Your reports
were a real pleasure to read.

222
00:14:54,616 --> 00:14:57,370
Concise, meticulous.
I appreciate that.

223
00:14:58,895 --> 00:15:02,762
- Good. Thank you.
- Does your sister prefer meat or fish ?

224
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,891
You have more than one ?

225
00:15:08,327 --> 00:15:09,536
Sister ?

226
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:10,918
No. Just Deb.

227
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,396
Or is she more
of a salad kind of person ?

228
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,695
- She's definitely a carnivore.
- Good.

229
00:15:22,224 --> 00:15:23,324
So...

230
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,087
the Rodrigo case.
Let's talk about that one.

231
00:15:28,871 --> 00:15:30,518
Kind of blew it, didn't you ?

232
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,611
- I'm sorry ?
- Anthony Rodrigo.

233
00:15:34,651 --> 00:15:38,631
Crack dealer with an apparent habit
of killing people who got in his way.

234
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,315
I believe this was

235
00:15:40,355 --> 00:15:43,389
yes, Doakes' and Batista's case.

236
00:15:44,184 --> 00:15:46,669
They finally tied Rodrigo
to one of his victims,

237
00:15:46,726 --> 00:15:48,659
built a solid manslaughter case,

238
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:51,459
would have got him off the street
for a few years.

239
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:55,146
But the case largely
rested on the bloodwork that you did.

240
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:01,685
Bloodwork that in the course
of the trial was proven to be, well...

241
00:16:02,481 --> 00:16:03,549
wrong.

242
00:16:05,058 --> 00:16:06,172
So, you...

243
00:16:06,638 --> 00:16:09,773
one of the most cautious and precise
forensic specialists

244
00:16:09,813 --> 00:16:13,231
I've had the pleasure to work with,
you performed bloodwork

245
00:16:13,271 --> 00:16:16,169
that directly led
to Rodrigo walking free.

246
00:16:16,631 --> 00:16:18,076
I asked myself,

247
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:21,288
"how the hell did that happen ?"

248
00:16:21,683 --> 00:16:24,430
<i>And did you answer:
"Dexter blew the case on purpose</i>

249
00:16:24,487 --> 00:16:27,156
<i>"so that he could get Rodrigo
off the streets for good</i>

250
00:16:27,232 --> 00:16:29,660
<i>"with a cordless reciprocating saw" ?</i>

251
00:16:30,901 --> 00:16:33,518
I'm sorry.
You've caught me off-guard here.

252
00:16:34,116 --> 00:16:35,611
Sloppy bloodwork.

253
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,129
This wasn't my idea.

254
00:16:43,457 --> 00:16:45,106
Could have said no.

255
00:16:45,497 --> 00:16:47,634
Come on, Angel, we have a job to do.

256
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:49,577
Since when my job is trying to prove

257
00:16:49,617 --> 00:16:51,789
to a fellow police officer
I'm not a killer ?

258
00:16:51,836 --> 00:16:53,369
That's not about that.

259
00:16:53,426 --> 00:16:55,829
- What is this about ?
- It's about finding someone

260
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:59,095
who had motive and opportunity
to kill all 18 of our victims.

261
00:16:59,138 --> 00:17:01,506
No way it's anybody in our department.

262
00:17:01,753 --> 00:17:03,676
Then help me prove it.

263
00:17:03,716 --> 00:17:07,212
Go through the Rodrigo case with me.
It is not just you.

264
00:17:07,252 --> 00:17:11,349
LaGuerta's cooperating on her old cases.
Even Matthews is coming in.

265
00:17:21,821 --> 00:17:23,320
The Rodrigo file.

266
00:17:27,183 --> 00:17:29,581
You just happen to have it with you.

267
00:17:30,726 --> 00:17:32,472
I'm a reasonable man.

268
00:17:36,954 --> 00:17:38,300
You know how it is.

269
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:41,262
The defense attorneys bring in
their so-called blood experts

270
00:17:41,302 --> 00:17:43,297
to counter everything I say.

271
00:17:43,457 --> 00:17:45,257
I'm familiar with the process.

272
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:49,325
I understand how this may look like
sloppy bloodwork to the layman.

273
00:17:49,365 --> 00:17:52,265
That's what Rodrigo's defense
convinced the jury of.

274
00:17:52,425 --> 00:17:54,206
But as you can see,

275
00:17:54,246 --> 00:17:57,769
the low-velocity blood drops
clearly point in the direction

276
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:00,728
opposite to that in which
we know Rodrigo to have fled,

277
00:18:00,768 --> 00:18:04,143
- which makes it impossible...
- Except those low-velocity drops

278
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:08,071
were revealed to actually be 90-degree
passive drops that were given tails

279
00:18:08,232 --> 00:18:10,174
due to the angle of the floor.

280
00:18:13,643 --> 00:18:16,163
Perhaps, but if you then examine

281
00:18:16,237 --> 00:18:18,801
- the blood trail...
- Which we know isn't a blood trail,

282
00:18:18,868 --> 00:18:20,585
but projected blood.

283
00:18:20,745 --> 00:18:23,404
You're not winning me over here,
Morgan.

284
00:18:36,661 --> 00:18:37,779
The truth ?

285
00:18:39,043 --> 00:18:40,359
By all means.

286
00:18:46,008 --> 00:18:49,301
I was overworked. I was carrying
half a dozen cases at once.

287
00:18:49,341 --> 00:18:52,033
It was a heat wave...
means a spike in...

288
00:18:52,417 --> 00:18:53,517
homicides.

289
00:18:55,752 --> 00:18:57,538
This one got pushed aside.

290
00:18:57,698 --> 00:19:01,406
I didn't write up my summary
until an hour before the trial.

291
00:19:01,872 --> 00:19:04,293
I obviously overlooked a few things.

292
00:19:05,908 --> 00:19:07,688
A murderer walked free

293
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,771
because you were overworked ?

294
00:19:11,858 --> 00:19:12,958
Yes.

295
00:19:26,307 --> 00:19:28,319
Who's this guy ? Lenny Asher.

296
00:19:28,488 --> 00:19:30,510
Lenny ? He's a nutjob...

297
00:19:30,609 --> 00:19:33,986
But it says he lived next door to
Rodrigo, filed all kinds of complaints.

298
00:19:34,067 --> 00:19:36,447
But he filed complaints
about everybody.

299
00:19:36,487 --> 00:19:38,181
He sat at his window all day

300
00:19:38,221 --> 00:19:40,838
and call us every time
he saw someone move.

301
00:19:40,891 --> 00:19:43,386
He called us once to say
there was something weird

302
00:19:43,443 --> 00:19:44,896
about the clouds.

303
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:48,086
Still no harm talking to him, right ?

304
00:19:50,718 --> 00:19:51,869
Lenny Asher ?

305
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,971
Who the hell are you ?

306
00:19:55,131 --> 00:19:57,450
Detective Batista.
This is officer Morgan.

307
00:19:57,526 --> 00:19:59,783
We're with the Miami metro homicide.

308
00:19:59,853 --> 00:20:01,272
Can we come in ?

309
00:20:08,652 --> 00:20:09,877
Who's dead ?

310
00:20:10,104 --> 00:20:14,303
- Anthony Rodrigo.
- I know. They found him in the ocean.

311
00:20:14,717 --> 00:20:17,114
I hope a whale ate him
and shat him out,

312
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:18,976
and then ate him again.

313
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:22,832
- You weren't too close to him, right ?
- He was scum !

314
00:20:23,701 --> 00:20:27,721
Yeah, you made numerous calls
about him when he used to live here.

315
00:20:27,997 --> 00:20:31,847
He was a drug dealer.
He played loud music,

316
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:34,481
urinated on my lilies.

317
00:20:34,762 --> 00:20:36,424
You actually saw that ?

318
00:20:36,464 --> 00:20:39,435
They were dead.
That's all I needed to know.

319
00:20:39,475 --> 00:20:41,787
Any thoughts as to
who might have killed him ?

320
00:20:41,836 --> 00:20:43,638
How the hell should I know ?

321
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:49,358
Look at that joker parked
right in front of the fire hydrant.

322
00:20:49,518 --> 00:20:51,763
I got his license plate, though.

323
00:20:54,232 --> 00:20:55,698
That would be our car.

324
00:21:00,013 --> 00:21:01,766
You take a lot of notes ?

325
00:21:01,806 --> 00:21:04,053
Anything hinky
happens outside this window,

326
00:21:04,158 --> 00:21:06,607
- I note it.
- How long you been doing that ?

327
00:21:06,703 --> 00:21:09,095
Since someone stuck a nail in my tire.

328
00:21:09,177 --> 00:21:11,140
March 1998.

329
00:21:11,263 --> 00:21:14,083
Rodrigo was last seen alive
the day after his trial.

330
00:21:14,123 --> 00:21:16,013
April 16, 2002.

331
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:20,586
- Think you took any notes that day ?
- If something happened, I did.

332
00:21:20,639 --> 00:21:22,634
You still have those notes ?

333
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,468
Here. 2002.

334
00:21:35,734 --> 00:21:37,823
What kind of order
did you put them in ?

335
00:21:38,014 --> 00:21:40,053
I told you: 2002.

336
00:21:44,449 --> 00:21:47,157
<i>I have no idea if Lundy
bought my excuse.</i>

337
00:21:48,461 --> 00:21:50,599
<i>Either way,
it makes me a little anxious</i>

338
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:53,888
<i>to see my sister looking through
the Rodrigo files,</i>

339
00:21:53,952 --> 00:21:55,332
<i>Looking for me.</i>

340
00:21:58,789 --> 00:22:01,144
You're never gonna guess
what I found.

341
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,384
What did you find ?

342
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:05,726
An apartment.

343
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:11,885
- Great.
- One-bedroom near 78th and Harding.

344
00:22:12,504 --> 00:22:13,682
Big change.

345
00:22:15,025 --> 00:22:16,654
It's time, you know ?

346
00:22:17,176 --> 00:22:19,911
- Good for you. When do you move ?
- As soon as possible,

347
00:22:20,025 --> 00:22:22,159
but not tonight. I have a date.

348
00:22:22,433 --> 00:22:24,808
I thought you broke up with Gabriel.

349
00:22:26,025 --> 00:22:27,556
It's someone new.

350
00:22:29,259 --> 00:22:30,292
Lundy.

351
00:22:33,736 --> 00:22:35,777
Lundy, special agent Lundy ?

352
00:22:37,096 --> 00:22:39,821
He's at least 20 years older than me.
What do you care ?

353
00:22:42,508 --> 00:22:43,680
I don't.

354
00:22:44,294 --> 00:22:45,394
I mean...

355
00:22:48,414 --> 00:22:50,737
I'm sure you wouldn't do
anything like that.

356
00:22:50,789 --> 00:22:52,860
What are you talking about ?
Do what ?

357
00:22:52,936 --> 00:22:55,234
Like try to sleep your way
to the top.

358
00:22:55,581 --> 00:22:57,038
You douche.

359
00:22:57,756 --> 00:22:59,405
That is so not true.

360
00:22:59,565 --> 00:23:03,242
No, of course not. I shouldn't have
even said anything, and I'm sure

361
00:23:03,402 --> 00:23:05,598
that thought would never even occur

362
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:06,942
Double douche !

363
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:10,112
You are not allowed
to talk about anyone I date

364
00:23:10,163 --> 00:23:13,391
as long you're seeing
little Miss "pardon my tits".

365
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:16,257
I am sorry, Dex, but she is gross...

366
00:23:16,954 --> 00:23:19,865
And pale,
and nobody is pale in Miami.

367
00:23:19,905 --> 00:23:22,471
She is obviously a vampire.

368
00:23:22,764 --> 00:23:26,394
A gross english-titty vampire.

369
00:23:27,629 --> 00:23:30,164
You just described the perfect woman.

370
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,844
<i>Truth is I need to avoid Lila
for now.</i>

371
00:23:36,927 --> 00:23:40,560
<i>Harry taught me that the key to survival
was staying one step ahead.</i>

372
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,750
<i>But Lundy almost trapped me today.</i>

373
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:45,278
<i>I can't be unprepared like that again.</i>

374
00:23:45,949 --> 00:23:47,227
Hey, it's me.

375
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:50,599
Why aren't you here ? I'm starving.

376
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,103
I thought you knew.
It's my bowling night.

377
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:56,568
<i>Bowling ? Really ?</i>

378
00:23:58,129 --> 00:23:59,921
What, like Fred Flintstone ?

379
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:02,697
I'm more in the Barney Rubble category.

380
00:24:03,438 --> 00:24:04,545
How fun.

381
00:24:05,023 --> 00:24:07,091
I'd love to watch you bowl.

382
00:24:08,332 --> 00:24:10,902
It's not really a spectator sport.

383
00:24:11,503 --> 00:24:13,391
<i>Well, I'll close my eyes.</i>

384
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:16,856
But it's sort of the guys'night out.

385
00:24:17,211 --> 00:24:19,808
<i>Come on, Dex, I want to meet your friends.</i>

386
00:24:20,718 --> 00:24:23,779
Where is it ? What time is it ? Give me the address.

387
00:24:26,324 --> 00:24:29,177
Starlight lanes. 1690 Michigan avenue.

388
00:24:29,647 --> 00:24:30,747
<i>7:00.</i>

389
00:24:33,409 --> 00:24:35,406
<i>I guess I'm going bowling.</i>

390
00:24:41,594 --> 00:24:42,858
Go, Dexter !

391
00:24:46,447 --> 00:24:48,442
He only got three pins down.

392
00:24:48,493 --> 00:24:51,128
I like to celebrate
the little things in life.

393
00:24:51,306 --> 00:24:54,768
If you like little things, I'm your man.
I mean, I'm not little everywhere.

394
00:24:54,941 --> 00:24:57,571
Some places I'm just perfectly average.

395
00:24:57,808 --> 00:24:59,832
You are perfectly adorable.

396
00:25:02,768 --> 00:25:05,278
Why you got a hug
and I got a pat on the nose ?

397
00:25:05,346 --> 00:25:07,689
'cause you're like a retarded puppy.

398
00:25:14,192 --> 00:25:17,872
Your ass does the cutest little thing
when you bowl.

399
00:25:20,229 --> 00:25:24,190
If you guys will excuse me,
i need to use the ladies'room.

400
00:25:31,241 --> 00:25:32,742
She's pretty hot.

401
00:25:33,275 --> 00:25:35,006
Yes. She is.

402
00:25:45,678 --> 00:25:46,858
Nice place.

403
00:25:49,129 --> 00:25:50,229
Very...

404
00:25:52,543 --> 00:25:53,643
Gray.

405
00:25:54,575 --> 00:25:58,381
Yes, the bureau have always been known
for their fashion sense.

406
00:25:58,488 --> 00:26:01,196
Honestly, all I care about is the kitchen.

407
00:26:03,266 --> 00:26:04,385
You cook ?

408
00:26:05,495 --> 00:26:08,306
Like I said, best restaurant in Miami.

409
00:26:09,284 --> 00:26:10,384
Really ?

410
00:26:11,419 --> 00:26:13,342
You're gonna cook for me.

411
00:26:14,086 --> 00:26:17,460
Well, don't ever expect me
to return the favor...

412
00:26:18,141 --> 00:26:20,437
Unless you're a big fan of toast.

413
00:26:20,905 --> 00:26:23,103
I would love to eat your toast.

414
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:26,707
Gosh, that sounded wrong.

415
00:26:27,434 --> 00:26:28,988
So, what's for dinner ?

416
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:32,495
Steak florentine
and grilled potatoes italian-style.

417
00:26:33,111 --> 00:26:34,214
Fucking-a.

418
00:26:34,603 --> 00:26:36,548
There's that mouth again.

419
00:26:37,115 --> 00:26:38,215
I'm sorry.

420
00:26:38,757 --> 00:26:40,701
It's just the way I talk.

421
00:26:41,663 --> 00:26:44,603
And if we're gonna be together,
you better get used to it.

422
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,133
Can't change who I am. I'm crass and...

423
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,017
dirty, and...

424
00:26:50,245 --> 00:26:52,188
I have a very filthy mind.

425
00:26:53,517 --> 00:26:56,264
- You're also pretty adorable.
- I know.

426
00:26:58,811 --> 00:27:00,617
Now start peeling potatoes.

427
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,437
I like a man that takes control.

428
00:27:09,058 --> 00:27:10,766
Wash your hands first.

429
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:14,155
You're so turning me on.

430
00:27:14,748 --> 00:27:18,485
You know, considering our age
difference, you're not too old to spank.

431
00:27:18,576 --> 00:27:20,159
No, stop. Please.

432
00:27:20,368 --> 00:27:22,311
I can't control myself.

433
00:27:23,301 --> 00:27:24,401
My God !

434
00:27:39,446 --> 00:27:41,592
Sure you don't wanna
grab a beer with us ?

435
00:27:41,645 --> 00:27:43,455
Nah, thanks. I'm tired.

436
00:27:49,937 --> 00:27:53,308
I hope you saved enough energy
for me.

437
00:27:53,733 --> 00:27:55,937
That doesn't look like
the look of love.

438
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,693
Sorry. I really am tired.
I think I'm gonna go home.

439
00:28:00,147 --> 00:28:01,698
Help ! Help !

440
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:06,032
Somebody please come !

441
00:28:12,433 --> 00:28:13,533
God.

442
00:28:16,298 --> 00:28:17,305
You OK ?

443
00:28:19,916 --> 00:28:22,546
- Dexter, you're bleeding.
- It's not deep.

444
00:28:22,593 --> 00:28:25,528
- I mean, what the hell ?
- He tried to grab my watch.

445
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,879
It's stupid.
I should have let him have it.

446
00:28:27,949 --> 00:28:29,367
It was... reflex.

447
00:28:29,565 --> 00:28:31,820
- Sure you're OK ?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

448
00:28:32,876 --> 00:28:35,750
Jesus Christ. They sell anyone
a gun in Florida, won't they ?

449
00:28:35,823 --> 00:28:37,814
Yeah, I know. Scary, right ?

450
00:28:38,022 --> 00:28:41,037
- Anyone get a license plate ?
- No, it was all too fast.

451
00:28:41,087 --> 00:28:44,857
- You want us to take you to a doctor ?
- No. Really, I'm fine.

452
00:28:45,174 --> 00:28:46,921
I'll take care of him.

453
00:28:52,792 --> 00:28:53,692
So...

454
00:28:54,424 --> 00:28:55,647
who was it ?

455
00:28:56,214 --> 00:28:57,314
Who ?

456
00:28:57,712 --> 00:29:01,584
That man. He wasn't trying to rob you.
He was trying to kill you.

457
00:29:04,686 --> 00:29:07,080
Santos Jiminez,
the man who murdered my mother.

458
00:29:07,147 --> 00:29:08,415
My God, Dexter.

459
00:29:08,479 --> 00:29:11,367
He must have followed me
to the bowling alley.

460
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,786
- If you hadn't have seen him in time...
- I saw him. That's all that matters.

461
00:29:23,318 --> 00:29:25,134
None of this scares you ?

462
00:29:26,844 --> 00:29:29,002
Nothing you could do, Dexter,

463
00:29:29,537 --> 00:29:30,971
would scare me.

464
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,369
I believe you.

465
00:29:39,414 --> 00:29:40,530
Come here.

466
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:46,315
Whatever comes,

467
00:29:48,241 --> 00:29:50,419
we'll get through this together.

468
00:29:51,017 --> 00:29:53,290
I'm not leaving your side, Dexter.

469
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,156
I'm not leaving yours.

470
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:00,439
Really ?

471
00:30:05,977 --> 00:30:07,822
Why would you think that ?

472
00:30:09,377 --> 00:30:11,850
You've just been a bit distant lately.

473
00:30:13,668 --> 00:30:16,004
I get that way when I'm stressed.

474
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,322
What are you stressed about ?

475
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,577
Right now, nothing.

476
00:30:33,773 --> 00:30:37,112
Do you think Dexter will come
for breakfast tomorrow ?

477
00:30:39,482 --> 00:30:41,327
I don't think so, honey.

478
00:30:41,585 --> 00:30:43,783
Well, maybe we should call him.

479
00:30:45,668 --> 00:30:47,160
It's kind of late.

480
00:30:47,819 --> 00:30:49,762
But Dexter stays up late.

481
00:30:50,219 --> 00:30:52,210
She doesn't want to call him.

482
00:30:53,675 --> 00:30:54,775
Why not ?

483
00:30:55,798 --> 00:30:57,962
Dexter and I broke up.

484
00:30:58,851 --> 00:31:02,134
- Why ?
- They don't like each other anymore.

485
00:31:03,196 --> 00:31:04,550
That's not true.

486
00:31:07,302 --> 00:31:10,020
Does that mean
he doesn't like us either ?

487
00:31:10,472 --> 00:31:13,489
No. Of course he likes you.

488
00:31:15,034 --> 00:31:17,286
It's just... That's hard.

489
00:31:18,015 --> 00:31:19,938
when two people break up.

490
00:31:20,539 --> 00:31:22,894
It makes them sad to see each other.

491
00:31:24,072 --> 00:31:28,071
I don't think Dexter's gonna be coming
for breakfast for a while.

492
00:31:32,149 --> 00:31:33,249
Sorry.

493
00:31:34,996 --> 00:31:38,563
<i>Lila may be the right woman for me
but she's wrong about one thing.</i>

494
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:40,884
<i>Recovery simply isn't an option.</i>

495
00:31:40,996 --> 00:31:44,331
<i>When I let my guard down,
I open myself up for attack...</i>

496
00:31:44,407 --> 00:31:45,642
<i>or capture.</i>

497
00:31:45,706 --> 00:31:48,772
<i>I need to embrace who I am,
who I've always been.</i>

498
00:31:49,177 --> 00:31:52,168
<i>I need to kill the man
who murdered my mother.</i>

499
00:31:57,164 --> 00:31:59,597
<i>I'd almost forgotten this feeling...</i>

500
00:32:00,278 --> 00:32:01,966
<i>Driving toward a kill,</i>

501
00:32:02,979 --> 00:32:04,888
<i>all my senses sharpened.</i>

502
00:32:06,487 --> 00:32:08,577
<i>It's like I've been living
underwater,</i>

503
00:32:08,633 --> 00:32:11,647
<i>holding my breath,
and now I can finally breathe.</i>

504
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:16,273
<i>So how come
it's so suffocating in here ?</i>

505
00:32:27,867 --> 00:32:31,397
- It's nice to see you.
- Yeah, feels all warm and comfy.

506
00:32:33,087 --> 00:32:34,952
I spoke to Todd about you.

507
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:36,150
Yeah ?

508
00:32:36,764 --> 00:32:38,490
He's very interested.

509
00:32:39,043 --> 00:32:41,523
He said someone with your special-ops
background

510
00:32:41,579 --> 00:32:43,963
typically starts at about $200,000.

511
00:32:44,226 --> 00:32:47,522
- I could live with that.
- You can meet him tonight.

512
00:32:47,729 --> 00:32:49,554
9:00, bar at the Hilton.

513
00:32:49,674 --> 00:32:50,989
I'll be there.

514
00:33:00,402 --> 00:33:02,170
I appreciate your time.

515
00:33:02,227 --> 00:33:04,386
Can we get this over with, sir ?

516
00:33:08,048 --> 00:33:12,123
It's interesting that of the 18 victims,
9 passed through this very station,

517
00:33:12,187 --> 00:33:15,071
and you worked on cases
involving 4 of them.

518
00:33:15,468 --> 00:33:18,597
And you were unable to obtain
a single conviction.

519
00:33:18,661 --> 00:33:22,214
The Smith case thrown out
because of inadmissible evidence.

520
00:33:22,315 --> 00:33:25,208
Orozco skipped bail,
never to be seen again.

521
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:28,618
The Rodrigo case lost
due to bad bloodwork.

522
00:33:28,888 --> 00:33:30,008
Excuse me ?

523
00:33:31,933 --> 00:33:33,837
You weren't aware of that ?

524
00:33:34,817 --> 00:33:37,940
The D. A. didn't get a conviction.
That's all I know.

525
00:33:41,014 --> 00:33:42,671
Are we through here, sir ?

526
00:33:44,112 --> 00:33:46,938
- No, actually. We're just...
- We're done.

527
00:33:55,857 --> 00:33:57,173
Look at this.

528
00:33:57,583 --> 00:34:00,624
"June 1st:
Mrs. Holcomb takes out trash,

529
00:34:00,907 --> 00:34:03,598
"drops soda bottle,
doesn't pick it up".

530
00:34:04,279 --> 00:34:05,515
"March 17th:

531
00:34:06,141 --> 00:34:08,065
"airplane flying too low".

532
00:34:08,202 --> 00:34:10,518
I told you, this guy's a fruit bat.

533
00:34:11,422 --> 00:34:12,522
"April".

534
00:34:13,089 --> 00:34:14,871
It's the month we want.

535
00:34:16,817 --> 00:34:18,167
"April 16th"...

536
00:34:20,147 --> 00:34:22,008
Fuck me sideways, listen to this.

537
00:34:22,058 --> 00:34:24,367
"Rodrigo gets into car
parked in wrong space.

538
00:34:24,421 --> 00:34:26,835
"Must be drunk
because someone's carrying him".

539
00:34:26,893 --> 00:34:29,640
The plate's here. This is
from 9:00 the night he disappeared.

540
00:34:29,687 --> 00:34:32,138
Last time he was seen alive.
We gotta run that plate.

541
00:34:32,186 --> 00:34:34,319
Whoever owned this car is our killer.

542
00:34:34,359 --> 00:34:36,477
- I'll get Lundy.
- He's out with his Feds.

543
00:34:36,554 --> 00:34:38,180
I'm calling him in.

544
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:47,461
<i>Lila almost had me believing
it was possible</i>

545
00:34:47,902 --> 00:34:51,264
<i>to change, to become something else,</i>

546
00:34:52,217 --> 00:34:54,367
<i>as if that ever really happens.</i>

547
00:34:55,187 --> 00:34:57,137
<i>I've always known what I am.</i>

548
00:34:59,117 --> 00:35:00,667
<i>"If the glove fits..."</i>

549
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:31,534
<i>A secret cabin
in the middle of the Everglades.</i>

550
00:36:32,947 --> 00:36:36,097
<i>what more could
a rededicated serial killer ask for ?</i>

551
00:36:50,611 --> 00:36:51,711
<i>Cocaine.</i>

552
00:36:51,874 --> 00:36:55,114
<i>Apparently Mr. Jiminez
never gave up his old habits.</i>

553
00:36:56,145 --> 00:36:57,885
<i>What a bad, bad man.</i>

554
00:37:28,798 --> 00:37:31,563
What ?
You think it just turned on by itself ?

555
00:37:35,952 --> 00:37:37,829
"There is no such plate".

556
00:37:38,517 --> 00:37:41,067
Is that a 1 or an "i" ? Fuck you, Lenny.

557
00:37:41,187 --> 00:37:42,837
Fuck your handwriting.

558
00:37:49,886 --> 00:37:51,434
Kind of busy here.

559
00:37:51,687 --> 00:37:54,837
Then can you please tell me
where I can find Dexter ?

560
00:37:54,923 --> 00:37:56,773
I brought him some dinner.

561
00:37:56,847 --> 00:37:59,151
- Dexter's not here.
- Where is he ?

562
00:37:59,352 --> 00:38:00,801
How should I know ?

563
00:38:00,865 --> 00:38:02,835
He said he was working late.

564
00:38:04,781 --> 00:38:06,603
Is that what he told you ?

565
00:38:07,443 --> 00:38:08,808
What do you mean ?

566
00:38:09,813 --> 00:38:11,355
He's not working late.

567
00:38:12,876 --> 00:38:14,807
I think he lied to you.

568
00:38:16,365 --> 00:38:17,975
Men are such pigs.

569
00:38:28,321 --> 00:38:30,799
I'm so sorry. I'm sure he'll show up.

570
00:38:30,873 --> 00:38:33,132
He's very excited about this job.

571
00:39:06,774 --> 00:39:10,351
I swear, I've tried every combination.
Nothing is coming up.

572
00:39:11,425 --> 00:39:13,877
I told you Lenny would be
a waste of time.

573
00:39:14,287 --> 00:39:16,437
Maybe it's not a Florida plate.

574
00:39:19,728 --> 00:39:20,962
Try Georgia.

575
00:39:23,095 --> 00:39:24,555
Holy shit, here it is.

576
00:39:25,682 --> 00:39:28,337
The vehicle was registered
to Charlie Lewis.

577
00:39:28,417 --> 00:39:29,867
I know that name.

578
00:39:30,625 --> 00:39:32,720
A drug dealer out of New York.

579
00:39:33,217 --> 00:39:34,452
A tough guy.

580
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:36,483
Likes to carry a big-ass knife.

581
00:39:36,644 --> 00:39:38,902
That's our guy.
That's the Bay Harbor butcher.

582
00:39:39,073 --> 00:39:41,073
I told you he wasn't a cop.

583
00:39:43,382 --> 00:39:44,283
What ?

584
00:39:44,693 --> 00:39:45,679
Shit.

585
00:39:45,818 --> 00:39:47,052
Where is he ?

586
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,841
According to this,
South Bay correctional facility.

587
00:39:51,034 --> 00:39:53,279
- What ? For how long ?
- Shit.

588
00:39:54,443 --> 00:39:57,687
Charlie Lewis was arrested
April 12, 2002.

589
00:39:57,737 --> 00:40:01,301
That's four days before Rodrigo was seen
being carried into the car.

590
00:40:01,351 --> 00:40:04,670
- Who had his car, one of his gang ?
- This is where it gets really bad.

591
00:40:04,766 --> 00:40:07,759
- The vehicle was seized as evidence.
- By who ?

592
00:40:07,907 --> 00:40:09,409
By our department.

593
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,457
Where was the vehicle held ?

594
00:40:12,746 --> 00:40:15,675
Right here in our evidence lab,
behind a secure gate.

595
00:40:15,759 --> 00:40:18,565
Someone signed the vehicle out,
picked Rodrigo up,

596
00:40:18,629 --> 00:40:21,028
killed him and then
signed the vehicle back in.

597
00:40:21,291 --> 00:40:24,234
- So you have records.
- Why would we keep them ?

598
00:40:24,516 --> 00:40:26,947
The only people allowed access
to those vehicles

599
00:40:26,987 --> 00:40:29,533
are members of the Miami Metro
Police Department.

600
00:40:29,587 --> 00:40:30,687
Holy shit.

601
00:40:34,369 --> 00:40:36,916
Bay Harbor Butcher is one of our own.

602
00:40:39,815 --> 00:40:42,074
We keep this to ourselves for now.

603
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:43,634
Just the three of us.

604
00:40:43,796 --> 00:40:46,553
I'm gonna go tell it
to a bottle of scotch.

605
00:41:26,189 --> 00:41:27,683
Here we are again.

606
00:41:29,378 --> 00:41:31,131
What... what the fuck ?

607
00:41:32,301 --> 00:41:34,268
I know. I keep asking myself

608
00:41:34,446 --> 00:41:36,084
that same question.

609
00:41:44,882 --> 00:41:46,981
- Let me out of here !
- But...

610
00:41:49,764 --> 00:41:53,579
I'm finding it's best to accept things
you can't change, you know ?

611
00:41:54,844 --> 00:41:56,730
Normally, I'd have a chat

612
00:41:56,798 --> 00:42:00,002
to make sure you understand
why you're here, but...

613
00:42:00,387 --> 00:42:02,737
I think you have a pretty good idea.

614
00:42:04,617 --> 00:42:05,717
Let me go.

615
00:42:06,917 --> 00:42:08,167
I got cocaine.

616
00:42:09,387 --> 00:42:11,137
You can have all of it.

617
00:42:11,717 --> 00:42:14,867
It's funny you should say that.
I am off the wagon.

618
00:42:16,517 --> 00:42:18,467
But that was never my drug.

619
00:42:20,759 --> 00:42:22,635
I'll fucking kill you !

620
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,637
No, Mr. Jiminez.

621
00:42:30,926 --> 00:42:33,035
<i>I'm gonna kill you tonight...</i>

622
00:42:34,019 --> 00:42:36,237
For what you did to my mother...

623
00:42:37,485 --> 00:42:40,182
and because,
well, this is what I do best.

624
00:42:50,165 --> 00:42:52,643
It's kind of fitting, don't you think ?

625
00:43:18,302 --> 00:43:20,493
Astor, Cody, come on, let's eat.

626
00:43:24,841 --> 00:43:28,197
- How'd you get the door unlocked ?
- It was already open.

627
00:43:29,949 --> 00:43:31,142
That's odd.

628
00:45:03,317 --> 00:45:04,483
Dexter, hi.

629
00:45:04,916 --> 00:45:08,124
Look, I'm sorry to bother you,
and I'm sure this is nothing,

630
00:45:08,216 --> 00:45:11,083
but I was just wondering if by chance
you were at my house.

631
00:45:11,816 --> 00:45:14,607
<i>- Well, no.
- It's just that the door was open</i>

632
00:45:14,778 --> 00:45:17,240
and you're the only other one
with a key.

633
00:45:21,405 --> 00:45:23,835
Rita, get out of the house.
Call the police.

634
00:45:23,903 --> 00:45:26,067
I'll be there as soon as I can.

635
00:45:30,467 --> 00:45:32,273
I can't leave you here.

636
00:45:33,336 --> 00:45:35,264
I can't take you with me.

637
00:45:37,013 --> 00:45:38,544
Don't go anywhere !

638
00:45:42,389 --> 00:45:44,921
Hey, I'm sorry to drag you into this.

639
00:45:45,105 --> 00:45:47,979
- No, I'm glad you called. The kids ?
- Next door.

640
00:45:51,187 --> 00:45:54,130
The place is empty.
No sign of forcible entry.

641
00:45:54,349 --> 00:45:57,235
I'm guessing you just forgot
to lock the door.

642
00:45:57,334 --> 00:46:00,114
- If you need anything else...
- No, you're not leaving.

643
00:46:00,278 --> 00:46:01,214
Sir ?

644
00:46:01,308 --> 00:46:02,953
Someone was in this house.

645
00:46:03,114 --> 00:46:06,414
I need you to stay here in the house
until I tell you it's safe.

646
00:46:06,575 --> 00:46:08,917
Really ? I need to do those things ?

647
00:46:09,007 --> 00:46:12,211
I'm with Miami metro homicide.
I know you don't take orders from me,

648
00:46:12,253 --> 00:46:14,947
but if you like, I could get
Lt LaGuerta on the phone.

649
00:46:14,987 --> 00:46:17,937
If you prefer to speak to cpt Matthews,
I can arrange it too.

650
00:46:18,602 --> 00:46:21,972
- Dexter, what's going on ?
- Please, just stay here, okay ?

651
00:46:23,927 --> 00:46:27,253
<i>It's one thing to fuck with me,
another to fuck with...</i>

652
00:46:27,355 --> 00:46:29,474
<i>my ex-girlfriend who hates me.</i>

653
00:46:30,066 --> 00:46:32,715
<i>The Lila experiment is officially over.</i>

654
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:37,639
Give me Rita's key.

655
00:46:42,945 --> 00:46:45,369
Well, that's your fault,
isn't it, Dexter ?

656
00:46:45,485 --> 00:46:48,193
You lied to me about working late,

657
00:46:48,987 --> 00:46:51,437
and I thought I might find you there.

658
00:46:52,422 --> 00:46:54,895
Do not ever go to Rita's house again.

659
00:46:55,199 --> 00:46:56,691
Do you understand ?

660
00:46:58,169 --> 00:47:00,210
Do you understand ?

661
00:47:02,673 --> 00:47:05,807
Is this the monster
that you keep telling me about ?

662
00:47:06,267 --> 00:47:08,852
Trust me, when you meet the monster,
you'll know.

663
00:47:12,684 --> 00:47:14,254
You called Jiminez.

664
00:47:15,146 --> 00:47:16,860
Yeah, I suppose I did.

665
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,347
Why ?

666
00:47:19,689 --> 00:47:21,781
Why would you try to have me killed ?

667
00:47:21,953 --> 00:47:25,827
You weren't going to get killed.
That's why I did it at the bowling,

668
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:28,777
so all your police-officer friends
would be there.

669
00:47:28,817 --> 00:47:31,584
What were you thinking ?
Are you insane ?

670
00:47:31,671 --> 00:47:34,597
I was trying to bring us
back together again !

671
00:47:34,862 --> 00:47:37,354
You were pulling away, and...

672
00:47:39,874 --> 00:47:41,531
Remember at the hotel

673
00:47:41,571 --> 00:47:43,368
after you faced Jiminez ?

674
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:47,283
That's... That's what I wanted !

675
00:47:48,587 --> 00:47:50,130
To bring you back !

676
00:47:52,596 --> 00:47:54,127
So you called him ?

677
00:47:56,087 --> 00:47:58,037
Well, it worked, didn't it ?

678
00:47:59,109 --> 00:48:00,346
Last night...

679
00:48:00,678 --> 00:48:01,778
You and I...

680
00:48:02,287 --> 00:48:04,237
You fell asleep in my arms.

681
00:48:08,747 --> 00:48:09,847
What ?

682
00:48:15,917 --> 00:48:19,564
You are more dangerous
than my addiction will ever be.

683
00:48:21,345 --> 00:48:22,717
That's saying a lot.

684
00:48:26,761 --> 00:48:28,390
Stay away from Rita.

685
00:48:29,725 --> 00:48:31,257
Stay away from me.

686
00:48:33,614 --> 00:48:34,714
Or what ?

687
00:48:37,597 --> 00:48:39,646
Or you will see the monster.
