1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,893
<i>Previously on "Dexter"...</i>

2
00:00:04,186 --> 00:00:06,554
<i>Two treasure hunters made
a ghastly discovery today</i>

3
00:00:06,814 --> 00:00:08,896
<i>when they stumbled
on what appears to be</i>

4
00:00:09,036 --> 00:00:12,033
<i>an underwater graveyard
in a crevice off the coast of Miami.</i>

5
00:00:12,173 --> 00:00:16,021
Agent Lundy has requested the following
officers for his joint task force.

6
00:00:16,448 --> 00:00:19,650
We're a team, and our first play
is IDing those bodies.

7
00:00:19,927 --> 00:00:22,549
- I'm Dexter Morgan.
- I know who you are.

8
00:00:22,788 --> 00:00:25,698
- Hoping they'll talk to you ?
- They always speak.

9
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,513
You just got to ask
the right question.

10
00:00:28,714 --> 00:00:30,017
<i>Harry was right.</i>

11
00:00:30,191 --> 00:00:33,062
<i>Nothing stays buried,
perhaps not even me.</i>

12
00:00:33,715 --> 00:00:35,556
Should I be worried about Pascal ?

13
00:00:35,696 --> 00:00:38,836
- And you're asking me because ?
- Because you've done the job.

14
00:00:39,096 --> 00:00:41,005
If she's out,
it means you're back in.

15
00:00:41,302 --> 00:00:44,378
I won't dignify rumors, captain.
Pascal's fine.

16
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:48,012
You need to, wrap your wrists
so you don't hurt yourself again.

17
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,541
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:54,069 --> 00:00:55,843
We'll get you into a program,

19
00:00:55,983 --> 00:00:58,033
we'll get you the help you need,

20
00:00:58,545 --> 00:01:00,196
and I will be there for you.

21
00:01:00,576 --> 00:01:03,843
I'm Dexter,
and I'm not sure what I am.

22
00:01:04,163 --> 00:01:06,489
Everyone in that room
has heard or lived

23
00:01:07,021 --> 00:01:09,586
far worse
than anything you've ever done.

24
00:01:10,943 --> 00:01:13,412
- I doubt it.
- How full of shit are you ?

25
00:01:13,672 --> 00:01:15,122
The mask is slipping.

26
00:01:15,382 --> 00:01:19,126
People who never mattered before
are suddenly starting to matter.

27
00:01:19,553 --> 00:01:23,191
Didn't your tour in the army
include some special op in haiti ?

28
00:01:24,641 --> 00:01:26,592
- There's my sponsor.
- Really ? Where ?

29
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:31,780
<i>Just as the worst heat wave in years
hits Miami,</i>

30
00:03:32,534 --> 00:03:34,384
<i>the heat is also on me.</i>

31
00:03:34,851 --> 00:03:38,284
<i>It's week three
of the Bay Harbor Butcher investigation,</i>

32
00:03:38,344 --> 00:03:41,955
<i>and superduper special agent Lundy
has yet to throw up his hands and say,</i>

33
00:03:42,015 --> 00:03:43,831
<i>"Wow, this guy's good.</i>

34
00:03:43,869 --> 00:03:45,188
<i>"I give up".</i>

35
00:03:45,723 --> 00:03:47,264
Dexter, please.

36
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:50,357
- You want me to help ?
- No, I just need you to move.

37
00:03:52,217 --> 00:03:55,830
I'm sorry. It's just, you know,
my mother's coming today.

38
00:03:55,987 --> 00:03:57,278
I certainly do.

39
00:03:57,325 --> 00:04:01,128
I haven't seen her in so long,
and I just want everything to be nice.

40
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:03,643
We kind of ended things
on bad terms.

41
00:04:04,815 --> 00:04:06,557
She and Paul didn't get along.

42
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:08,902
A lot of people and Paul
didn't get along.

43
00:04:08,922 --> 00:04:10,425
Yeah, but I...

44
00:04:11,104 --> 00:04:13,779
I think she's willing
to put that behind us.

45
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:17,772
She heard about Paul's passing.
She wanted to come and be supportive.

46
00:04:17,948 --> 00:04:19,484
That sounds promising.

47
00:04:20,645 --> 00:04:21,784
Absolutely.

48
00:04:24,186 --> 00:04:26,808
You'll like her, Dexter.
She's great.

49
00:04:27,088 --> 00:04:29,038
She's a very strong woman.

50
00:04:29,145 --> 00:04:32,780
I'll keep that in mind in case
I have any heavy lifting to do.

51
00:04:32,927 --> 00:04:34,344
It's too hot.

52
00:04:34,442 --> 00:04:37,260
I know, honey.
Hopefully it'll cool down soon.

53
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,255
Did you sleep any better last night ?

54
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:40,471
More nightmares ?

55
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:42,932
What was it, the big scary ghost
or the alligator ?

56
00:04:43,004 --> 00:04:45,413
No, the Bay Harbor Butcher.

57
00:04:47,058 --> 00:04:49,680
- Oh, honey.
- He would never hurt you.

58
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,718
But I'll let you in on a secret.

59
00:04:54,056 --> 00:04:57,739
My sister, Debra, who is
a secret police agent ninja warrior,

60
00:04:57,799 --> 00:04:59,586
said he only kills bad people,

61
00:04:59,621 --> 00:05:01,701
and you're not a bad person,
are you ?

62
00:05:03,054 --> 00:05:04,524
Then you're quite safe.

63
00:05:04,559 --> 00:05:06,293
Why don't you go get dressed,

64
00:05:06,328 --> 00:05:09,078
and I will make you
some breakfast, okay ?

65
00:05:11,649 --> 00:05:13,199
It makes me so angry

66
00:05:13,234 --> 00:05:16,484
that there's some monster
out there scaring my son.

67
00:05:18,328 --> 00:05:21,743
- I got to go to work.
- You know, I hope they catch him today.

68
00:05:21,764 --> 00:05:24,640
And I'm not a violent person,
but I hope they hurt him.

69
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:26,419
Have a good day.

70
00:05:27,378 --> 00:05:28,973
<i>Make up your mind.</i>

71
00:05:39,758 --> 00:05:43,594
<i>In our most paranoid moments, we fear
that everyone is talking about us.</i>

72
00:05:43,678 --> 00:05:45,244
<i>That's become my reality.</i>

73
00:05:46,973 --> 00:05:49,631
<i>I can't hear what they're
saying, but I know it's not nice.</i>

74
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,417
Alright, let's get started.

75
00:05:51,801 --> 00:05:54,879
We have positive IDs on all 18
of our complete bodies.

76
00:05:55,338 --> 00:05:57,703
13 of those have felony records.

77
00:05:58,268 --> 00:05:59,679
Organized crime.

78
00:06:00,322 --> 00:06:03,596
No connection to organized crime,
no mutual gang affiliation either.

79
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:05,687
But all thirteen

80
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:09,229
were either tried for murder
or at least suspected of murder.

81
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:13,218
- Still, you have your pattern.
- Yes, we just don't know what it means.

82
00:06:16,586 --> 00:06:18,945
I think we go out with this news
immediately.

83
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:21,277
What news ?

84
00:06:21,312 --> 00:06:24,828
The news that our serial killer
is only killing the dregs of society.

85
00:06:24,848 --> 00:06:27,689
That good, moral people
have nothing to fear.

86
00:06:27,937 --> 00:06:29,458
But, captain, that's all...

87
00:06:30,363 --> 00:06:34,377
This is the only lead we have.
We need to keep it tightly wrapped.

88
00:06:34,722 --> 00:06:37,630
Last night, an elderly man shot his son
when he came home late.

89
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,848
Thought it was
the Bay Harbor Butcher.

90
00:06:39,965 --> 00:06:42,176
We've got a city in chaos here,
Frank.

91
00:06:42,562 --> 00:06:44,881
I understand you wanting
to reassure the people.

92
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:47,023
Good. Then we're in agreement.

93
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:55,557
Dex, I got this huge break
in the Bay Harbor case.

94
00:06:55,603 --> 00:06:56,803
Bullshit.

95
00:06:56,876 --> 00:06:58,321
I mean, really ?

96
00:06:59,412 --> 00:07:00,731
Guys, guys !

97
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,072
You are not gonna...

98
00:07:03,688 --> 00:07:06,971
<i>I refuse to believe that Vince Masuka
is the man</i>

99
00:07:07,053 --> 00:07:08,995
<i>who single-handedly brings me down.</i>

100
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:13,485
<i>I also know denial is the first stage
of the grieving process</i>

101
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,182
<i>for those who learn
they're going to die.</i>

102
00:07:20,183 --> 00:07:22,750
<i>I need to find out
what Masuka knows,</i>

103
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:26,163
<i>but I've got to be calm
and centered...</i>

104
00:07:27,126 --> 00:07:28,574
<i>And focused.</i>

105
00:07:30,085 --> 00:07:32,267
<i>Time for a visit to my sponsor.</i>

106
00:07:32,814 --> 00:07:34,151
<i>I need help.</i>

107
00:07:54,235 --> 00:07:55,157
Hi !

108
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,657
Hey ! Just a minute !

109
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:05,690
- Hope I'm not interrupting anything.
- No. Glad you called.

110
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,673
Just give me a minute.

111
00:08:10,676 --> 00:08:12,711
Yeah, have a look around.

112
00:08:22,151 --> 00:08:25,029
So, I was gonna go
and get some art supplies.

113
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:29,192
Is that alright ?
Do you want to come ?

114
00:08:30,044 --> 00:08:33,225
- Yeah, I'm just on my lunch break.
- Excellent.

115
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,386
Why are they eating each other ?

116
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:38,757
Don't know. Ask them.

117
00:08:51,835 --> 00:08:53,668
do you like the heat ?

118
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,672
Not really.
I'm partial to air-conditioning.

119
00:08:57,998 --> 00:08:59,263
I love it.

120
00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:03,197
It makes me feel like the whole world
could explode at any moment.

121
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,035
That's a pleasant thought.

122
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:09,365
- Is there an art store near here ?
- So, you been using ?

123
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:10,921
Using what ?

124
00:09:12,915 --> 00:09:15,022
No drugs. Perfectly clean.

125
00:09:15,057 --> 00:09:17,129
Look what we have here !

126
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:20,126
Jesus. What are you...

127
00:09:23,451 --> 00:09:24,651
Come on.

128
00:09:29,862 --> 00:09:31,721
Are you gonna help or what ?

129
00:09:46,451 --> 00:09:48,358
That was a little weird.

130
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,574
So, if you're perfectly clean,
why'd you call ?

131
00:09:53,768 --> 00:09:57,069
I- I'm under a lot of pressure
at work.

132
00:09:57,265 --> 00:10:00,515
I was hoping you could maybe
give me some quick tips

133
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,293
on how to deal with the urges.

134
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,950
There are no quick tips.

135
00:10:06,841 --> 00:10:07,876
I see.

136
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:20,735
Someone's gonna hear that.
They'll think it's the wind.

137
00:10:21,516 --> 00:10:23,419
I thought we were getting
art supplies.

138
00:10:23,426 --> 00:10:26,203
That's exactly what we're doing.

139
00:10:27,658 --> 00:10:29,454
I work with found art.

140
00:10:30,581 --> 00:10:32,568
It's more like stolen art.

141
00:10:33,288 --> 00:10:36,043
Is this what a sponsor normally
does on their 1st meeting ?

142
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:37,246
I don't know.

143
00:10:37,281 --> 00:10:39,506
I've never sponsored anyone before.

144
00:10:39,527 --> 00:10:41,540
- Really ?
- Yeah, but don't worry.

145
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:45,086
I've had all kinds of sponsors.
Learned from the best.

146
00:10:45,683 --> 00:10:48,381
You do realize I work
with the police department ?

147
00:10:49,347 --> 00:10:51,951
If we get caught,
you can flash your badge.

148
00:10:53,167 --> 00:10:55,789
I don't have a badge.
I have a laminate.

149
00:11:00,471 --> 00:11:02,836
Could we talk
about why I called you ?

150
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,859
Yeah, sure.

151
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,359
You want help.

152
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:10,347
So, tell me.

153
00:11:13,495 --> 00:11:14,945
Why do you use ?

154
00:11:17,675 --> 00:11:18,682
Why ?

155
00:11:20,593 --> 00:11:23,357
I don't know.
It's just part of who I am.

156
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,822
And who are you ?

157
00:11:28,443 --> 00:11:29,643
I'm a...

158
00:11:32,273 --> 00:11:33,500
bad person.

159
00:11:35,264 --> 00:11:38,711
You haven't got the first idea
who you are, have you ?

160
00:11:39,951 --> 00:11:42,016
Dexter, meet Dexter.

161
00:11:42,925 --> 00:11:46,130
I'm gonna help the two of you
get to know each other.

162
00:11:47,862 --> 00:11:50,312
That doesn't really seem necessary.

163
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:53,237
The first step to recovery
is accepting who you are.

164
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,670
I thought the 1st step was admitting
you have a problem.

165
00:11:56,705 --> 00:12:00,035
And before you can accept who you are,
you have to know who you are.

166
00:12:00,452 --> 00:12:02,267
So that's our first job.

167
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:06,183
You're going to tell me all
your deepest, darkest secrets.

168
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,416
There is something off
about him, Harry.

169
00:12:13,743 --> 00:12:15,135
You know why.

170
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:17,157
Alright, look.

171
00:12:17,681 --> 00:12:20,431
It wouldn't hurt to have him
tested, would it ?

172
00:12:30,856 --> 00:12:32,084
Just a sec.

173
00:12:33,036 --> 00:12:34,833
I got to get back. Dead body.

174
00:12:34,915 --> 00:12:37,573
<i>How many times have you used
that one before ?</i>

175
00:12:39,973 --> 00:12:42,998
So, the husband's name
is Barnes, B-A-R-N-E-S.

176
00:12:46,447 --> 00:12:49,139
- What do we have ?
- Hello, Dexter.

177
00:12:49,324 --> 00:12:52,552
Gunshot victim, Alisha Barnes, 36.

178
00:12:56,714 --> 00:12:59,996
I heard there may be some big break
in the Bay Harbor Butcher case.

179
00:12:59,998 --> 00:13:01,307
Could be.

180
00:13:01,813 --> 00:13:05,726
A neighbor heard her argue with
her husband last night, Curtis Barnes.

181
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:08,938
- Masuka was pretty excited about it.
- Husband's car is gone.

182
00:13:08,973 --> 00:13:11,156
- Nobody knows where he is.
- What did they find ?

183
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:14,029
Can we concentrate
on this case here, please ?

184
00:13:15,214 --> 00:13:16,295
Sure.

185
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:21,238
The killer was standing right about
where you are, sergeant Doakes.

186
00:13:22,203 --> 00:13:24,183
Two shots to the chest.

187
00:13:24,257 --> 00:13:27,639
- I only see one hole in the chest.
- Yes, they're that close together.

188
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:29,559
Very impressive shooting.

189
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:33,214
It looks like the bullets
took nearly identical exit paths,

190
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:34,697
judging from the spray.

191
00:13:34,732 --> 00:13:37,917
And this was all topped off
by a final shot to the head.

192
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,674
- She was "mozambiqued".
- What ?

193
00:13:40,742 --> 00:13:42,159
Triple-tapped.

194
00:13:47,762 --> 00:13:48,726
Shit.

195
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:52,374
I'm guessing this is Curtis Barnes.

196
00:13:52,404 --> 00:13:55,503
Here he is in what looks like
Somalia, Afghanistan,

197
00:13:55,538 --> 00:13:57,229
a Russian grenade, a Kurdish dagger,

198
00:13:57,264 --> 00:14:00,089
and tell me that shit wasn't
stolen from Saddam's palace.

199
00:14:00,091 --> 00:14:03,735
- What are you saying ?
- I'm saying asshole's special ops.

200
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:05,369
There's no doubt about it.

201
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:08,959
They're generally known for settling
their arguments so peaceably.

202
00:14:09,658 --> 00:14:11,528
Don't get smug with me.

203
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,503
Sounds like we're
in your world, James.

204
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,719
Yeah, I'll take lead on this one.

205
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:29,091
- Pick a body.
- Sir ?

206
00:14:29,303 --> 00:14:31,312
I want you each to pick a body.

207
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:36,112
This is where the case is going to be
made. We have 13 suspected murderers,

208
00:14:36,692 --> 00:14:39,186
<i>and then we have these gentlemen.</i>

209
00:14:41,051 --> 00:14:44,443
Robert Thatcher,
janitor for the school district

210
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,243
with no criminal record.

211
00:14:46,637 --> 00:14:47,938
Marcus White,

212
00:14:48,109 --> 00:14:49,722
tow-truck driver,

213
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,196
no criminal record.

214
00:14:52,743 --> 00:14:53,911
And this...

215
00:14:54,445 --> 00:14:55,514
this is...

216
00:14:57,407 --> 00:14:58,846
Oscar Sota.

217
00:15:02,366 --> 00:15:03,924
What's his story ?

218
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:06,296
Naval engineer
for the port of Miami,

219
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:09,850
member of the stewardship council
of St. Tarsicia catholic church,

220
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,852
married, loved, respected.

221
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:16,369
But he was found in a bag
under the sea with 13 killers.

222
00:15:16,413 --> 00:15:17,413
Why ?

223
00:15:17,878 --> 00:15:20,978
Answer that question,
then we really know something.

224
00:15:21,107 --> 00:15:22,471
I got him.

225
00:15:22,761 --> 00:15:24,081
Oscar Sota.

226
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:29,286
Why did the killer cut them up
like this ?

227
00:15:29,518 --> 00:15:31,769
- Ease of disposal.
- Or for fun.

228
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:37,461
You don't kill this many people
because it's a chore.

229
00:15:37,496 --> 00:15:39,296
You do it 'cause you like it.

230
00:15:43,537 --> 00:15:44,551
Great.

231
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:47,313
Tomorrow.

232
00:15:48,016 --> 00:15:49,265
The Barnes case ?

233
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:53,340
Yeah, that was a buddy from special ops.
He says Curtis Barnes is still in Miami.

234
00:15:54,706 --> 00:15:58,107
The only part of that that I find
surprising is that you have a buddy.

235
00:15:59,336 --> 00:16:02,487
It turns out Barnes and I
both were ranger RRD.

236
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:05,316
Regimental Reconnaissance Detachment.

237
00:16:05,351 --> 00:16:08,802
Guys you're not supposed to know about,
who get in before everybody else.

238
00:16:08,837 --> 00:16:11,742
- A brother in arms.
- Something like that.

239
00:16:11,744 --> 00:16:14,901
My buddy put me in touch
with a guy from Curtis' unit.

240
00:16:14,936 --> 00:16:17,251
- He's willing to talk to me.
- Good.

241
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:21,069
I got your blood report.
It's all pretty straightforward.

242
00:16:21,104 --> 00:16:23,443
- I'd be careful, though.
- Why is that ?

243
00:16:23,793 --> 00:16:27,075
The trajectory of the bullets are
level, exact same angle of origin.

244
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:29,894
All 3 shots were
fired in less than 1 sec.

245
00:16:29,897 --> 00:16:31,913
Very impressive shooting.

246
00:16:42,628 --> 00:16:44,987
I need you to run some tests
on this shirt.

247
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:47,740
- Is there blood ?
- No blood.

248
00:16:48,373 --> 00:16:51,398
- I'm really the blood guy.
- It's a smell.

249
00:16:51,433 --> 00:16:53,202
It smells like a woman.

250
00:16:55,003 --> 00:16:56,165
Which part ?

251
00:16:58,076 --> 00:17:00,332
Who can identify this for me ?

252
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:07,578
You know, that's really Masuka's area.
He's definitely your man.

253
00:17:10,952 --> 00:17:12,152
Thanks.

254
00:17:18,664 --> 00:17:22,320
<i>Anything I can do to overburden Masuka
is to my advantage.</i>

255
00:17:22,355 --> 00:17:24,826
<i>Trust me, I'm not above
sending pizzas and hookers</i>

256
00:17:24,827 --> 00:17:27,333
<i>to his house
in the middle of the night.</i>

257
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:37,663
Well, everything's unpacked.

258
00:17:38,492 --> 00:17:41,530
The back bedroom's small,
but it's quieter.

259
00:17:42,281 --> 00:17:44,692
I'm just happy to be here,
that's all.

260
00:17:44,716 --> 00:17:46,860
- You're always welcome.
- Am I ?

261
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,617
- I wasn't sure.
- Of course you are.

262
00:17:52,385 --> 00:17:54,823
All these years
without an invitation.

263
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,473
I thought you didn't want to come.

264
00:17:57,508 --> 00:17:59,364
- You and paul...
- Nonsense.

265
00:17:59,476 --> 00:18:03,690
I wasn't gonna let that keep me away
from my daughter and my grandchildren.

266
00:18:05,082 --> 00:18:07,447
But you did let it keep you away.

267
00:18:08,451 --> 00:18:12,262
Let's not assign blame, Rita.
Nothing good ever comes of that.

268
00:18:12,314 --> 00:18:15,664
We'll just have to make up
for lost time, that's all.

269
00:18:17,118 --> 00:18:18,541
- Hi.
- Hey.

270
00:18:22,199 --> 00:18:25,216
- Dexter, this is my mother.
- Gail.

271
00:18:26,067 --> 00:18:28,924
- So nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too, Dexter.

272
00:18:34,686 --> 00:18:37,161
<i>I've always been good with parents.</i>

273
00:18:38,602 --> 00:18:41,268
<i>The key is to simply think of them
as aliens</i>

274
00:18:41,303 --> 00:18:43,193
<i>from a distant universe.</i>

275
00:18:45,584 --> 00:18:48,520
<i>"You have fibers and threads
unknown to us.</i>

276
00:18:51,828 --> 00:18:53,907
<i>"Your ancient customs intrigue me".</i>

277
00:18:56,658 --> 00:19:00,515
So, Dexter, tell me everything
there is to know about you.

278
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,876
<i>You have made me your sworn enemy,</i>

279
00:19:03,936 --> 00:19:05,244
<i>evil woman.</i>

280
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:09,290
I work in the forensics department
for the Miami Metro P.D.,

281
00:19:09,337 --> 00:19:11,510
and I'm very fond of your daughter.

282
00:19:12,778 --> 00:19:15,590
Good answer.
I'm also very fond of my daughter.

283
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:18,724
- You did a good job raising her.
- 30 years as a schoolteacher.

284
00:19:18,784 --> 00:19:21,225
I've got a little experience
with children.

285
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,666
And I see a young man
who is not eating.

286
00:19:23,945 --> 00:19:25,433
I'm not hungry.

287
00:19:25,468 --> 00:19:28,163
He's scared the butcher's
gonna get him.

288
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,845
Well, remember,
he only gets bad people.

289
00:19:30,992 --> 00:19:34,667
I was bad, today.
I threw a ball at Tommy Alvarez.

290
00:19:35,322 --> 00:19:37,394
Well, that's not too bad,

291
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:40,495
and anyway, the Bay Harbor
Butcher doesn't hurt kids.

292
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:43,722
- He doesn't ?
- Definitely not. You're safe.

293
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:50,590
- They should hurry to catch him.
- They are working as hard as they can.

294
00:19:50,884 --> 00:19:52,679
If what I've heard is true,

295
00:19:52,714 --> 00:19:55,886
that he only goes after criminals,
I say leave him alone.

296
00:19:57,276 --> 00:19:59,494
He's got my seal of approval.

297
00:20:02,567 --> 00:20:05,703
<i>Perhaps I have misjudged you,
oh wise one.</i>

298
00:20:22,709 --> 00:20:23,734
Really ?

299
00:20:24,895 --> 00:20:28,269
Yeah, sister spilled everything.
Thinks he killed their parents

300
00:20:28,304 --> 00:20:31,953
and made it look like a car accident.
The living trust was in his name.

301
00:20:33,481 --> 00:20:34,653
Nice work.

302
00:20:36,303 --> 00:20:39,236
So, what's it gonna be tonight ?
Chinese ?

303
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:42,749
- Italian ?
- Actually, I have a...

304
00:20:43,323 --> 00:20:45,055
social appointment.

305
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,709
You mean a date ?

306
00:20:49,438 --> 00:20:51,436
I guess you could call it that.

307
00:20:52,338 --> 00:20:53,951
Look at you.

308
00:20:54,164 --> 00:20:56,694
New in town and already hooking up.

309
00:20:56,783 --> 00:20:59,193
It's an introduction
arranged by a friend.

310
00:20:59,228 --> 00:21:02,382
One needs to get out and have
a little fun on occasion.

311
00:21:02,384 --> 00:21:05,318
It's something I strongly
recommend for you as well.

312
00:21:05,381 --> 00:21:08,774
- Yeah. With the hours we work...
- I'm serious.

313
00:21:08,974 --> 00:21:10,540
Make time for it.

314
00:21:10,575 --> 00:21:12,885
It'll help keep you better balanced.

315
00:21:13,848 --> 00:21:15,057
Yes, sir.

316
00:21:24,301 --> 00:21:25,606
Are you okay ?

317
00:21:26,264 --> 00:21:27,877
Yeah, it's just...

318
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,940
something at work.

319
00:21:33,744 --> 00:21:35,694
Are you handling it okay ?

320
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:39,990
I ended up seeing my sponsor
today at lunch.

321
00:21:43,374 --> 00:21:44,602
How'd that go ?

322
00:21:45,631 --> 00:21:48,575
Not so great. She's a little odd.

323
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:51,376
Plays a little loose
with the 12 steps.

324
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,743
That doesn't seem smart,
making up your own.

325
00:21:55,557 --> 00:21:58,508
Maybe it's 'cause
it's her first time being a sponsor.

326
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:04,662
Maybe you should try someone else.

327
00:22:05,432 --> 00:22:08,439
I just want to do what's best
for my recovery.

328
00:22:09,217 --> 00:22:12,477
Well, maybe someone older,
more like you, more...

329
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,147
manly.

330
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:16,641
Yeah, maybe.

331
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:18,458
Yeah.

332
00:22:50,149 --> 00:22:51,836
- Hey.
- Hey.

333
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,609
You remember me ?

334
00:22:57,932 --> 00:22:58,981
Yeah.

335
00:22:59,283 --> 00:23:02,948
- You're the girl who doesn't like tape.
- Debra, actually.

336
00:23:03,271 --> 00:23:04,521
I'm Gabriel.

337
00:23:07,154 --> 00:23:09,721
- Done for the night ?
- Yeah.

338
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,854
Any interest in grabbing a drink ?

339
00:23:20,464 --> 00:23:22,801
Usually, a lady has to buy me
dinner first.

340
00:23:22,852 --> 00:23:25,302
Stop talking and get your pants off.

341
00:23:27,897 --> 00:23:29,785
- Are you always like this ?
- No.

342
00:23:29,831 --> 00:23:32,367
No, I haven't even had sex since...

343
00:23:32,675 --> 00:23:33,812
Since what ?

344
00:23:36,851 --> 00:23:38,298
You all right ?

345
00:23:38,305 --> 00:23:40,934
- Yeah, just 1 sec.
- We don't have to do this, you know ?

346
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:47,030
You're into the kinky stuff, huh ?

347
00:23:47,075 --> 00:23:50,229
No, the last guy I had sex with
tried to kill me.

348
00:24:04,627 --> 00:24:06,937
<i>"Who is the bay harbor butcher ?"</i>

349
00:24:07,684 --> 00:24:08,691
<i>God.</i>

350
00:24:08,714 --> 00:24:11,336
<i>This obsession with him
is relentless,</i>

351
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:14,089
<i>just like Deb
and that damn treadmill.</i>

352
00:24:24,027 --> 00:24:25,823
Deb, do you ever stop ?

353
00:24:26,345 --> 00:24:28,392
Dexter, you're supposed
to be at Rita's !

354
00:24:28,394 --> 00:24:29,402
Sorry.

355
00:24:33,612 --> 00:24:34,661
Fuck.

356
00:24:49,318 --> 00:24:50,711
Good morning.

357
00:24:51,762 --> 00:24:54,365
So, that was a little weird
last night.

358
00:24:54,428 --> 00:24:56,415
No, yeah. Well...

359
00:24:56,587 --> 00:24:57,719
It was dark.

360
00:24:57,754 --> 00:25:00,981
My eyes hadn't adjusted.
All I could see were shadows.

361
00:25:01,726 --> 00:25:04,880
Well, lease put those
shadows out of your mind.

362
00:25:06,703 --> 00:25:09,544
So, what's this big break
in the bay harbor butcher case

363
00:25:09,579 --> 00:25:12,035
- I keep hearing about ?
- Algae.

364
00:25:12,405 --> 00:25:14,146
- Algae ?
- Yeah.

365
00:25:14,491 --> 00:25:18,333
Masuka found microscopic algae
inside the garbage bags with the bodies.

366
00:25:19,596 --> 00:25:23,875
Algae under the sea... Imagine that.
How does that help ?

367
00:25:24,379 --> 00:25:27,717
'cause there are over 100,000
species, all different.

368
00:25:27,798 --> 00:25:31,638
Vince thinks it'll help to find in which
harbor the killer keeps his boat.

369
00:25:33,216 --> 00:25:35,956
He's got some marine biologists
coming down to take a look.

370
00:25:35,991 --> 00:25:39,909
Can you imagine something so little
being the thing that breaks this case ?

371
00:25:39,927 --> 00:25:41,283
I gotta go.

372
00:25:41,516 --> 00:25:43,566
I'll see you at the station.

373
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,350
<i>It doesn't make sense.</i>

374
00:25:47,436 --> 00:25:49,340
<i>If there's algae on my victims,</i>

375
00:25:49,375 --> 00:25:52,229
<i>it would have to come from the ocean
where I dumped them.</i>

376
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,715
<i>Obviously, I'm missing something
and I don't like that.</i>

377
00:25:58,396 --> 00:26:01,960
Mrs. Sota, I understand you wanting
to protect your husband's reputation,

378
00:26:02,032 --> 00:26:04,612
but I also have to tell you
that your cooperation

379
00:26:04,647 --> 00:26:06,352
can help us catch a serial killer.

380
00:26:06,387 --> 00:26:08,925
- I am cooperating.
- You haven't told me anything.

381
00:26:08,979 --> 00:26:11,088
'cause there's nothing to tell !

382
00:26:18,633 --> 00:26:19,833
Maria.

383
00:26:20,626 --> 00:26:22,702
You off to meet the man
from Curtis' unit ?

384
00:26:22,704 --> 00:26:25,678
- Yeah, at the Blue Wing Marina.
- You have backup ?

385
00:26:25,845 --> 00:26:28,490
Oh, yeah, all kinds of backup.
Helicopters and shit.

386
00:26:29,828 --> 00:26:32,340
Listen, we got a missing
murder suspect.

387
00:26:32,342 --> 00:26:35,997
This guy's a friend of his.
I'm just gonna go talk to him.

388
00:26:38,292 --> 00:26:39,300
Right.

389
00:26:40,894 --> 00:26:44,571
You're the lone holdout.
Every other suspect has a criminal past,

390
00:26:44,701 --> 00:26:47,007
and not just any criminal past.

391
00:26:47,062 --> 00:26:50,967
- They were all linked to murder.
- Oscar never murdered anybody.

392
00:26:51,027 --> 00:26:52,565
Then why was he killed ?

393
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,796
Maybe he found out
who the serial killer is !

394
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:58,618
OK, so your husband is an engineer
and a secret crime fighter.

395
00:26:59,899 --> 00:27:02,594
- Are you through ?
- You're gonna tell me what he did.

396
00:27:02,616 --> 00:27:04,689
Oh, no. You are through.

397
00:27:07,506 --> 00:27:09,235
Just what I needed.

398
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,349
Hello ?

399
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,404
You Doakes ?

400
00:27:47,243 --> 00:27:48,232
I am.

401
00:27:49,375 --> 00:27:52,281
And I guess you're not
gonna tell me your name.

402
00:27:52,344 --> 00:27:53,847
I'm Curtis Barnes.

403
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,211
I checked you out.

404
00:27:59,231 --> 00:28:03,069
We know a lot of the same people.
Everyone says I can trust you.

405
00:28:03,102 --> 00:28:04,696
You can trust me.

406
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:08,536
I just need 48 hours.
I got somebody to take me to Cuba,

407
00:28:08,708 --> 00:28:10,875
but it'll take a day
to get the papers I need.

408
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:13,633
- So, what are you asking ?
- Stall the investigation.

409
00:28:18,514 --> 00:28:20,348
Let me ask you one question.

410
00:28:22,348 --> 00:28:23,355
Yeah.

411
00:28:25,891 --> 00:28:27,761
Did you kill your wife ?

412
00:28:31,633 --> 00:28:34,058
Yeah. I killed Alisha.

413
00:28:35,958 --> 00:28:37,048
Turn around.

414
00:28:37,855 --> 00:28:40,785
- Turn the fuck around !
- No, you are not arresting me !

415
00:28:40,909 --> 00:28:43,960
- Put the gun down and turn around !
- I don't think so.

416
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:58,375
So, how'd your social
appointment go last night ?

417
00:28:58,728 --> 00:29:00,671
Oh, you know...

418
00:29:02,847 --> 00:29:04,184
I took your advice.

419
00:29:05,164 --> 00:29:06,740
My advice ?

420
00:29:07,729 --> 00:29:11,323
To get out and have some fun.
Got laid big-time.

421
00:29:15,189 --> 00:29:16,306
Well...

422
00:29:21,765 --> 00:29:22,947
I mean...

423
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:26,456
I don't usually just go to
the gym and pick up strangers.

424
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:29,066
The gym ?

425
00:29:30,514 --> 00:29:33,713
You have to save me here, or I'm
gonna go outside and shoot myself.

426
00:29:33,778 --> 00:29:36,299
The way you're going,
you'd probably miss.

427
00:29:37,149 --> 00:29:38,285
Thanks.

428
00:29:38,896 --> 00:29:40,106
My date...

429
00:29:40,704 --> 00:29:41,881
was horrible.

430
00:29:42,031 --> 00:29:46,139
I picked her up and I don't know Miami,
of course, so I got us completely lost.

431
00:29:46,521 --> 00:29:50,405
And she's chattered away the whole time
about a yogi master I just have to meet,

432
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,060
so by the time we got to restaurant,
I had tore my hair out.

433
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:55,565
- God. I'm sorry.
- No, it was good.

434
00:29:55,844 --> 00:29:58,007
It was a reminder that...

435
00:29:58,853 --> 00:30:00,379
I shouldn't be dating.

436
00:30:01,419 --> 00:30:02,992
Of course you should be.

437
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:08,510
It all comes down
to simple mathematics.

438
00:30:08,542 --> 00:30:10,792
A really beautiful relationship

439
00:30:10,998 --> 00:30:13,235
is a once-in-a-lifetime thing,

440
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:15,863
And I've already had mine.

441
00:30:29,975 --> 00:30:34,315
Hey, so, I heard you found some algae
that might help crack the big case.

442
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:36,457
- You heard right.
- What kind of algae ?

443
00:30:36,583 --> 00:30:37,902
Diatoms.

444
00:30:40,144 --> 00:30:41,845
Eukaryotic algae.

445
00:30:42,352 --> 00:30:46,261
<i>Okay, this is the first time I regret
not being a bigger nerd.</i>

446
00:30:46,296 --> 00:30:48,768
- Eukaryotic ?
- I'll let Manny explain it to you.

447
00:30:48,803 --> 00:30:52,033
He's picking up the evidence tomorrow
so he can study it in his own lab.

448
00:30:52,068 --> 00:30:54,627
You know marine biologists,
Real prima donnas.

449
00:30:54,725 --> 00:30:56,879
- Any chance you could show me ?
- Masuka.

450
00:30:56,958 --> 00:30:58,339
Up front.

451
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,008
Oh, no. It's that crazy witch.

452
00:31:08,593 --> 00:31:10,143
What is this shit ?

453
00:31:10,262 --> 00:31:12,312
I told you to find a smell.

454
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,105
How fucking hard can that be ?

455
00:31:14,462 --> 00:31:18,295
- Look, I told you, a smell isn't...
- It smells like another woman.

456
00:31:19,702 --> 00:31:21,713
I can smell it ! Why can't you ?

457
00:31:22,224 --> 00:31:24,663
This man is ruining my life,

458
00:31:24,722 --> 00:31:27,835
and you all go on like
nothing is happening !

459
00:31:32,598 --> 00:31:33,624
Come on.

460
00:31:37,118 --> 00:31:40,882
<i>This is the kind of thing
that makes me glad I have no feelings.</i>

461
00:31:40,918 --> 00:31:44,260
<i>Like they always say, never take
your dirty laundry to work.</i>

462
00:32:02,727 --> 00:32:06,314
We can stand here all day, I don't give
a fuck, but you'll put that gun down.

463
00:32:06,908 --> 00:32:08,654
Now, we were both rangers.

464
00:32:08,656 --> 00:32:11,293
That bond goes deep.
That doesn't mean anything to you ?

465
00:32:11,954 --> 00:32:14,540
If you weren't a ranger,
I'd have shot your ass by now.

466
00:32:16,786 --> 00:32:18,503
You killed your wife, man.

467
00:32:23,478 --> 00:32:25,109
I didn't mean to.

468
00:32:27,361 --> 00:32:28,993
It happened, man.

469
00:32:31,478 --> 00:32:32,797
You married ?

470
00:32:36,612 --> 00:32:37,693
Ever ?

471
00:32:38,671 --> 00:32:39,751
Once.

472
00:32:40,173 --> 00:32:42,575
She dropped your ass, didn't she ?

473
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:45,563
What ?

474
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:49,104
Got tired of you punching holes
in the walls,

475
00:32:49,586 --> 00:32:52,286
waking up in the middle
of the night screaming ?

476
00:32:53,463 --> 00:32:57,535
Was she always yelling,
"You gotta get help" ?

477
00:32:58,674 --> 00:33:01,039
So she sends you to some doctor,

478
00:33:01,334 --> 00:33:02,947
but you don't go,

479
00:33:04,539 --> 00:33:08,262
'cause you know there's no help
for this kind of fucked up.

480
00:33:09,481 --> 00:33:12,810
And finally, she can't take it anymore
and she just says

481
00:33:14,757 --> 00:33:16,205
<i>"adiós".</i>

482
00:33:22,695 --> 00:33:24,583
That sound about right ?

483
00:33:27,487 --> 00:33:29,246
You got it wrong, man.

484
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:32,947
I left her.

485
00:33:35,366 --> 00:33:36,942
And why was that ?

486
00:33:38,942 --> 00:33:41,803
'cause I was afraid if I didn't,
I'd kill her.

487
00:33:47,857 --> 00:33:49,381
Let's take the boat out.

488
00:33:51,502 --> 00:33:55,637
- Why would we want to do that, man ?
- We'd get out of this heat, for one.

489
00:33:56,365 --> 00:33:58,638
Nice ocean breeze.

490
00:34:00,696 --> 00:34:02,125
Maybe head toward Cuba.

491
00:34:04,949 --> 00:34:08,153
Come on, just get me to within sight.
I could swim from there.

492
00:34:08,216 --> 00:34:12,088
- Once I'm there, I could find the...
- You're wasting your time.

493
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:15,182
You're going back
to the station with me.

494
00:34:16,527 --> 00:34:18,341
no. I'm not going to prison.

495
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,210
- I didn't mean to kill her.
- It's the only way out of here.

496
00:34:26,367 --> 00:34:28,494
Can't get you to reconsider ?

497
00:34:30,396 --> 00:34:31,807
Not a chance.

498
00:34:33,753 --> 00:34:35,531
Well, that's too bad...

499
00:34:36,302 --> 00:34:38,226
'cause like I said

500
00:34:38,283 --> 00:34:42,097
- I'm not going to prison.
- Put the fucking gun down, Curtis.

501
00:34:42,284 --> 00:34:43,841
Don't make me do it !

502
00:34:53,085 --> 00:34:54,203
Motherfucker.

503
00:35:08,181 --> 00:35:10,299
You gonna tell me how you're doing ?

504
00:35:11,495 --> 00:35:12,704
I'm fine.

505
00:35:14,263 --> 00:35:16,261
Come on, dex. Open up.

506
00:35:17,244 --> 00:35:18,472
<i>Very fine ?</i>

507
00:35:21,058 --> 00:35:23,020
You're gonna have to do better
than that.

508
00:35:24,013 --> 00:35:26,433
What's going on inside your head ?

509
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:28,653
What are you thinking ?

510
00:35:31,232 --> 00:35:32,918
I'm afraid we're...

511
00:35:34,055 --> 00:35:35,199
Done...

512
00:35:35,557 --> 00:35:36,757
You and I.

513
00:35:38,816 --> 00:35:40,025
Serious ?

514
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:43,479
You're breaking up with me ?

515
00:35:44,819 --> 00:35:48,597
Actually, I don't think I want
to answer any more questions.

516
00:35:49,004 --> 00:35:52,724
Listen, Dexter, whatever you
think is right is wrong.

517
00:35:52,857 --> 00:35:56,095
He asks you a question,
I want you to think of your answer first

518
00:35:56,228 --> 00:35:59,294
and then tell him
the exact opposite, okay ?

519
00:35:59,797 --> 00:36:01,893
So, let's just jump in, all right ?

520
00:36:01,946 --> 00:36:05,669
Does it make you angry
when your teachers tell you what to do ?

521
00:36:09,466 --> 00:36:11,079
Are you often bored ?

522
00:36:15,083 --> 00:36:17,430
Have you ever killed an animal ?

523
00:36:18,132 --> 00:36:19,782
No. Never.

524
00:36:28,095 --> 00:36:30,075
I should get back to work.

525
00:36:31,782 --> 00:36:33,019
Thanks...

526
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,826
for everything.

527
00:36:49,084 --> 00:36:51,647
I heard about Pascal's
little meltdown.

528
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:54,350
She's been under a lot of stress.

529
00:36:54,633 --> 00:36:57,373
- You're still doing it.
- What's that ?

530
00:36:57,701 --> 00:36:59,200
Sticking up for her.

531
00:36:59,745 --> 00:37:01,816
She is my superior.

532
00:37:03,473 --> 00:37:06,361
You know, I may have
misjudged you, Maria.

533
00:37:07,113 --> 00:37:10,032
Maybe you are more
than a political animal.

534
00:37:11,008 --> 00:37:12,880
You just might be a real cop.

535
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:16,289
That's what I've been trying
to tell you.

536
00:37:16,845 --> 00:37:18,803
You're back in charge of homicide,

537
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,910
effective immediately.

538
00:37:25,127 --> 00:37:26,318
Thank you.

539
00:37:28,837 --> 00:37:32,187
Pascal just set women in
the department back 20 years.

540
00:37:32,207 --> 00:37:34,657
It's up to you to turn that around.

541
00:37:44,081 --> 00:37:47,804
<i>There it is,
like a gigantic white whale.</i>

542
00:37:48,456 --> 00:37:49,806
<i>My moby dick.</i>

543
00:37:55,161 --> 00:37:56,903
Man, this heat.

544
00:37:57,878 --> 00:37:59,362
I can't take it.

545
00:38:01,658 --> 00:38:04,904
I've got to get in my car
before I fucking melt.

546
00:38:07,433 --> 00:38:11,633
<i>Which is exactly what needs to happen
to my dearly departed friends.</i>

547
00:38:24,174 --> 00:38:27,079
- Lila, what are you doing here ?
- Hey. Dexter.

548
00:38:27,558 --> 00:38:31,464
You know, I've been thinking
about you breaking up with me,

549
00:38:31,921 --> 00:38:33,295
and, well,

550
00:38:34,416 --> 00:38:37,249
I don't think
it's in your best interest.

551
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:41,592
I'm tired...

552
00:38:41,792 --> 00:38:44,221
and hot, and I have somewhere to be.

553
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:46,432
I think you should give me
another chance.

554
00:38:46,493 --> 00:38:49,229
There's nothing you can do
to help me.

555
00:38:49,271 --> 00:38:51,184
It's not even you. It's me.

556
00:38:51,219 --> 00:38:54,390
I am who I am,
and nobody's gonna change that.

557
00:38:55,326 --> 00:38:57,416
Whatever you think you are,

558
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,095
you don't have to be that.

559
00:39:01,846 --> 00:39:03,574
That's where you're wrong.

560
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,488
Stop judging yourself.

561
00:39:06,693 --> 00:39:08,921
There are no absolutes.

562
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:11,755
No one's all good or evil.

563
00:39:18,307 --> 00:39:20,617
You're just gonna have
to trust me on this.

564
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:24,970
Jesus, Dexter ! What are you
so fucking scared of ?

565
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:27,354
You make yourself into a monster

566
00:39:27,389 --> 00:39:30,290
so you no longer bear
responsibility for what you do.

567
00:39:30,307 --> 00:39:32,214
"I can't help it. I'm a monster.

568
00:39:32,249 --> 00:39:34,908
"Of course I was gonna do that.
I'm a monster".

569
00:39:34,943 --> 00:39:37,146
It's sad and it's pathetic...

570
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:39,949
And it breaks my heart.

571
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,932
You don't think there're
monsters in this world ?

572
00:39:43,967 --> 00:39:45,783
You don't believe people are evil ?

573
00:39:51,176 --> 00:39:52,862
I'll show you evil.

574
00:40:09,251 --> 00:40:11,600
Well, you want me to open one ?

575
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:26,071
Joseph cepeda.

576
00:40:38,357 --> 00:40:39,768
Can I touch ?

577
00:40:49,653 --> 00:40:52,349
<i>This isn't exactly the reaction
I was looking for.</i>

578
00:40:52,943 --> 00:40:56,158
Well, I've never seen anything
like this before.

579
00:40:57,546 --> 00:40:59,434
You're not disgusted...

580
00:41:00,483 --> 00:41:02,463
Appalled, horrified ?

581
00:41:05,568 --> 00:41:07,020
It's...

582
00:41:08,556 --> 00:41:10,077
Incredible.

583
00:41:13,073 --> 00:41:15,331
But the person who did this...

584
00:41:15,697 --> 00:41:18,166
Is a person just like me,

585
00:41:18,585 --> 00:41:19,752
like you.

586
00:41:21,109 --> 00:41:23,438
We're all good, Dexter,

587
00:41:23,838 --> 00:41:25,515
and we're all evil.

588
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:32,807
<i>I thought I closed the door to anyone
ever seeing me for who I am,</i>

589
00:41:32,842 --> 00:41:34,475
<i>but this woman sees me.</i>

590
00:41:35,189 --> 00:41:36,912
<i>She doesn't know it,</i>

591
00:41:37,083 --> 00:41:40,946
<i>but she's looking behind the mask,
and she's not turning away.</i>

592
00:41:42,668 --> 00:41:44,485
You really impressed me today.

593
00:41:44,638 --> 00:41:47,374
I don't know how you did it,
but great job.

594
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:52,198
- I just pretended to be someone else.
- Well, it's working. Keep doing it.

595
00:41:52,233 --> 00:41:54,954
That doctor didn't even
see the monster inside you.

596
00:41:59,379 --> 00:42:02,753
Not monster. It's just, son, you know
that you have these dark urges.

597
00:42:04,163 --> 00:42:06,290
Anyway, good job.

598
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:14,889
<i>And somehow,
even under all this pressure,</i>

599
00:42:15,038 --> 00:42:19,362
<i>she's able to make me feel okay
about who I am and what I am.</i>

600
00:42:27,974 --> 00:42:28,981
So...

601
00:42:32,095 --> 00:42:33,671
see you soon ?

602
00:42:44,923 --> 00:42:46,535
I'm here for you.

603
00:43:17,984 --> 00:43:21,859
- I've already told you everything.
- I know. I'm sorry.

604
00:43:23,332 --> 00:43:24,982
I came here to apologize.

605
00:43:26,724 --> 00:43:28,723
- You were very rude.
- I was.

606
00:43:30,614 --> 00:43:34,094
It was shameful of me to disgrace
the memory of your husband.

607
00:43:37,005 --> 00:43:38,205
Thank you.

608
00:43:41,167 --> 00:43:43,275
It's been a rough few days,

609
00:43:43,669 --> 00:43:46,566
not that you should care
about that, but...

610
00:43:48,365 --> 00:43:50,529
You know, all these bodies --

611
00:43:51,642 --> 00:43:53,739
I've never seen anything like it.

612
00:43:55,864 --> 00:43:57,367
All murdered...

613
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:00,377
Cut into pieces.

614
00:44:03,833 --> 00:44:06,529
The only way I could
make sense out of it

615
00:44:06,564 --> 00:44:09,226
was to convince myself
that they deserved it.

616
00:44:09,671 --> 00:44:12,469
They all needed to be bad people.

617
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:15,969
But I should never have
taken it out on you.

618
00:44:26,531 --> 00:44:27,981
Can you feel it ?

619
00:44:29,258 --> 00:44:30,458
The breeze ?

620
00:44:31,544 --> 00:44:33,377
Coming over the water ?

621
00:44:35,121 --> 00:44:36,312
It's nice.

622
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:37,807
Yeah.

623
00:44:38,493 --> 00:44:40,369
It's finally cooling down.

624
00:44:47,471 --> 00:44:49,002
Have a nice evening.

625
00:44:49,983 --> 00:44:51,063
Wait.

626
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:57,165
My husband...

627
00:44:58,056 --> 00:45:01,265
He kept guns hidden in the walls.

628
00:45:01,529 --> 00:45:03,106
I can show you.

629
00:45:30,029 --> 00:45:32,713
<i>I've never broken into
my own place of employment,</i>

630
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:34,513
<i>but desperate times...</i>

631
00:45:47,718 --> 00:45:49,771
<i>Garbagemen can be so careless.</i>

632
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:55,754
<i>I say put this Bay Harbor Butcher
on the city payroll.</i>

633
00:45:55,853 --> 00:46:00,322
<i>Give him a corner office, a company car
and all the ammunition he needs.</i>

634
00:46:00,348 --> 00:46:03,283
<i>At least somebody is doing something
to clean up Miami,</i>

635
00:46:03,318 --> 00:46:07,213
<i>which is more than I can say
for those folks down at city hall.</i>

636
00:46:15,725 --> 00:46:17,323
- Hey, Debra.
- Hi.

637
00:46:18,424 --> 00:46:20,330
Sorry about last night.

638
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:22,994
Don't be.

639
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,763
Maybe we can...

640
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:27,497
do it again.

641
00:46:29,792 --> 00:46:32,928
How would you feel about a real date ?
You know,

642
00:46:33,322 --> 00:46:35,008
with clothes on ?

643
00:46:35,399 --> 00:46:37,986
Where we actually talk
and get to know each other ?

644
00:46:38,072 --> 00:46:39,831
Something like that.

645
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:42,694
Sounds good. How about Saturday ?

646
00:46:43,868 --> 00:46:44,868
Deal.

647
00:46:46,392 --> 00:46:48,060
Pick you up at 8:00.

648
00:46:54,623 --> 00:46:57,512
<i>And with us right now, we have
psychologist Sandy Ramos</i>

649
00:46:57,547 --> 00:47:00,567
<i>to provide insight
into the Bay Harbor Butcher...</i>

650
00:47:00,602 --> 00:47:03,587
<i>evil serial killer
or avenging force for good ?</i>

651
00:47:07,847 --> 00:47:09,662
this is the last time.

652
00:47:10,412 --> 00:47:11,622
Bertrand ?

653
00:47:13,272 --> 00:47:16,206
Babe, come on. You don't mean that.

654
00:47:16,241 --> 00:47:18,235
No, I do mean it. I do.

655
00:47:18,638 --> 00:47:22,201
- I can't see you anymore.
- Wait. No, wait, no.

656
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:25,000
I don't understand, Maria.

657
00:47:25,463 --> 00:47:27,737
This... this is done ?

658
00:47:27,852 --> 00:47:29,788
She's gone. It's over with.

659
00:47:30,188 --> 00:47:33,581
We can finally be out in the open.

660
00:47:34,215 --> 00:47:36,726
Just you and me, okay ?

661
00:47:37,182 --> 00:47:39,181
Just like what we wanted.

662
00:47:40,567 --> 00:47:42,823
No, Bertrand, stop.

663
00:47:49,663 --> 00:47:51,478
Go back to esmee.

664
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:57,213
So, what, this is how it is ?

665
00:47:59,717 --> 00:48:03,604
You get your job back,
and now you're through with me ?

666
00:48:03,639 --> 00:48:07,043
Look, don't play the victim. You knew
what this was from the beginning.

667
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:13,206
You are one coldhearted bitch,
I'll tell you that.

668
00:48:14,637 --> 00:48:16,918
No, you don't get
to tell me anything !

669
00:48:17,572 --> 00:48:20,436
I am not the piece of shit
fucking another woman

670
00:48:20,471 --> 00:48:23,662
behind his fiancée's back !
You try and judge me, asshole.

671
00:48:27,162 --> 00:48:29,812
You don't know
the first thing about me.

672
00:48:42,243 --> 00:48:44,693
Yeah, so, I think I misjudged Lila.

673
00:48:46,204 --> 00:48:47,633
Are you sure ?

674
00:48:47,698 --> 00:48:51,699
I mean, she's unconventional,
but I think she's the best sponsor...

675
00:48:51,738 --> 00:48:53,112
for me.

676
00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:57,540
Well, if she can help
keep you clean.

677
00:48:59,613 --> 00:49:02,675
Who's this ?
Could it be Robin Hood ?

678
00:49:02,836 --> 00:49:04,925
No, I'm the butcher man !

679
00:49:05,683 --> 00:49:09,239
I made it for him. I thought
it might help with the nightmares.

680
00:49:09,259 --> 00:49:11,223
Bet you didn't know you could fly.

681
00:49:18,571 --> 00:49:20,349
<i>Have I misjudged Lila ?</i>

682
00:49:21,158 --> 00:49:22,660
<i>I have no idea.</i>

683
00:49:23,534 --> 00:49:27,365
<i>I do know she's helping me
look at myself in a different way.</i>

684
00:49:29,799 --> 00:49:33,393
- He's good, that one.
- I know. I got lucky.

685
00:49:33,821 --> 00:49:35,360
Quite an actor.

686
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:40,049
He's hiding something.
I'm sure of it.

687
00:49:50,748 --> 00:49:52,705
For example,
we find the genus nitzschia,

688
00:49:52,707 --> 00:49:55,335
and we know we're talking
about a freshwater marina,

689
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:57,250
and the algae can tell us more

690
00:49:57,285 --> 00:49:59,703
about what kind of pollutants
are in the water,

691
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:01,690
which would even further narrow...

692
00:50:20,108 --> 00:50:21,267
Damn it !

693
00:50:24,356 --> 00:50:28,467
<i>For the first time, I feel the future
might hold something different for me.</i>

694
00:50:28,718 --> 00:50:31,358
<i>It's possible
I'm just fooling myself,</i>

695
00:50:31,766 --> 00:50:33,972
<i>but I'm willing to take the risk.</i>

696
00:50:36,758 --> 00:50:38,408
Fucking garbagemen.

697
00:50:39,529 --> 00:50:42,884
Broke the refrigeration unit.
It blew hot air all night.

698
00:50:42,897 --> 00:50:45,347
It turned the bodies into pink mush.

699
00:50:45,919 --> 00:50:47,164
How awful !

700
00:50:47,922 --> 00:50:49,586
Completely ruined.

701
00:50:51,439 --> 00:50:54,171
You brought your marine
biologist and everything.

702
00:50:56,172 --> 00:50:57,572
It made him vomit.

703
00:51:01,532 --> 00:51:04,246
Anyway, good thing the heat
didn't affect the rocks.

704
00:51:04,281 --> 00:51:07,103
Lundy had us store them separately.

705
00:51:07,789 --> 00:51:11,176
- The rocks ?
- Yeah. The algae we found on the rocks.

706
00:51:11,796 --> 00:51:14,657
The Bay Harbor Butcher used them
to weigh his bags down.

707
00:51:14,659 --> 00:51:17,194
We assume he picked them up
where he docks his boat.

708
00:51:21,915 --> 00:51:25,235
But I thought the marine biologist
came to examine the bodies.

709
00:51:25,347 --> 00:51:27,734
No. No, it's all about
the rocks, baby.

710
00:51:28,213 --> 00:51:31,295
Manny took him to his lab.
Should have results in a week or so.

711
00:51:31,315 --> 00:51:34,726
That should help us narrow down
what marina they came from.

712
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:37,946
<i>It's an odd sensation
to be experiencing</i>

713
00:51:37,947 --> 00:51:41,138
<i>what might be called hope
for the first time in my life.</i>

714
00:51:41,158 --> 00:51:44,695
<i>At the same time, I suddenly find myself
weighing the benefits</i>

715
00:51:44,697 --> 00:51:47,295
<i>of electrocution
versus lethal injection.</i>

716
00:51:47,946 --> 00:51:49,400
<i>But here I am.</i>
