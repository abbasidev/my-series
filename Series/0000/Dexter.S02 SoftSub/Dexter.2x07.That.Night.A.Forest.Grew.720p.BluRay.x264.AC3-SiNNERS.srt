1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,000
<i>Previously on "Dexter"...</i>

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,340
If you were the Bay Harbor Butcher,
would you use a place like this ?

3
00:00:06,602 --> 00:00:09,051
The conditions on this space
don't support his MO.

4
00:00:09,313 --> 00:00:11,094
Maybe he's having an identity crisis.

5
00:00:11,396 --> 00:00:12,623
Your brother's a junkie

6
00:00:12,827 --> 00:00:14,972
Are you high ?
He's never smoked a cigarette.

7
00:00:15,273 --> 00:00:16,888
Cody's enjoying himself.

8
00:00:17,028 --> 00:00:19,436
- Dexter's very patient with 'em.
- Dexter's a saint.

9
00:00:19,823 --> 00:00:21,855
I hope you could dig up
an old file for me.

10
00:00:22,128 --> 00:00:23,008
Got a date ?

11
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:25,183
It's the crime scene
where Harry found me.

12
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:28,065
<i>- How much ?
- 300 bricks, give or take.</i>

13
00:00:28,707 --> 00:00:30,530
I've been waiting for a chance
to take you.

14
00:00:30,792 --> 00:00:32,074
I know how you feel.

15
00:00:32,336 --> 00:00:34,743
He crossed the line.
He broke into my lab.

16
00:00:35,005 --> 00:00:37,742
- He's probably gonna tail me again.
- Doakes tailed you ?

17
00:00:37,928 --> 00:00:40,832
I followed him to an N.A. meeting.
That asshole lied about that too.

18
00:00:41,015 --> 00:00:42,461
- You're obsessed.
- I'm not.

19
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:43,683
Open your eyes !

20
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:45,504
Dinner was fantastic, Rita.

21
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:48,008
I kind of like her.

22
00:00:49,027 --> 00:00:50,592
<i>Just calling to check in.</i>

23
00:00:50,854 --> 00:00:54,513
<i>Imagine her face if I told her you and I
spent the night together in a hotel.</i>

24
00:00:54,775 --> 00:00:55,973
It's over, Dexter.

25
00:00:57,401 --> 00:00:58,970
I hope with Lundy it'll be different.

26
00:00:59,188 --> 00:01:00,637
- Why ?
- I respect him.

27
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:04,001
- You love him.
- No. He's like my dad.

28
00:01:04,374 --> 00:01:05,983
You wanna tell me what's going on ?

29
00:01:06,245 --> 00:01:08,459
You said I'm supposed
to feel my feelings !

30
00:01:08,748 --> 00:01:11,196
Now I'm telling you
to get them under control !

31
00:01:21,104 --> 00:01:22,653
Which step was that ?

32
00:03:22,628 --> 00:03:24,678
Use the entire canvas.

33
00:03:26,228 --> 00:03:29,568
Start from the top.
Work your way down.

34
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:33,847
Light, feathery strokes.

35
00:03:34,696 --> 00:03:35,960
Perfect !

36
00:03:36,974 --> 00:03:38,174
Stunning.

37
00:03:38,728 --> 00:03:40,578
Try longer strokes now.

38
00:03:42,758 --> 00:03:43,958
Perfect.

39
00:04:03,328 --> 00:04:06,078
You really know what you want,
don't you ?

40
00:04:09,928 --> 00:04:11,678
I hope you don't mind.

41
00:04:13,328 --> 00:04:14,851
Some men do.

42
00:04:17,429 --> 00:04:20,179
I've always found
instruction manuals...

43
00:04:20,612 --> 00:04:21,986
Quite useful.

44
00:04:29,911 --> 00:04:31,111
Your turn.

45
00:04:33,028 --> 00:04:34,578
What do you want ?

46
00:04:38,927 --> 00:04:40,591
I think that was it.

47
00:04:42,028 --> 00:04:43,393
Come on...

48
00:04:45,428 --> 00:04:46,991
You must have some

49
00:04:47,369 --> 00:04:48,982
dark fantasies...

50
00:04:50,828 --> 00:04:52,824
unfulfilled urges.

51
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,578
I'm pretty good at acting on those.

52
00:04:59,328 --> 00:05:00,428
Really ?

53
00:05:01,531 --> 00:05:03,162
Then fuck me like that.

54
00:05:18,428 --> 00:05:20,278
Your light's burned out.

55
00:05:20,628 --> 00:05:22,223
It's the wiring.

56
00:05:22,285 --> 00:05:23,763
I've been asking

57
00:05:23,798 --> 00:05:26,786
my landlord to fix it for weeks.

58
00:05:29,761 --> 00:05:31,274
Now I can see better.

59
00:05:32,027 --> 00:05:34,111
That's where my landlord lives.

60
00:05:34,128 --> 00:05:35,903
Now he'll have to fix it.

61
00:05:38,952 --> 00:05:40,326
See you later.

62
00:05:44,728 --> 00:05:48,278
<i>Got to admire Lila for taking things
into her own hands.</i>

63
00:05:50,028 --> 00:05:51,578
<i>That includes me.</i>

64
00:05:57,504 --> 00:05:58,704
Mom.

65
00:05:59,066 --> 00:06:01,479
Come on, let's go ! No more moping.

66
00:06:01,758 --> 00:06:03,840
I'm not moping. I'm sleeping.

67
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:07,477
Oversleeping, 3rd time this week.
The only way you gonna get over Dexter

68
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,587
is if you take charge of your day.

69
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:13,900
Come on.
You're not in high school anymore.

70
00:06:13,962 --> 00:06:16,944
Go scrub your face,
and I'll heat up some oatmeal.

71
00:06:26,828 --> 00:06:29,278
Didn't hear you come in last night.

72
00:06:29,428 --> 00:06:30,982
Well, it was late.

73
00:06:31,448 --> 00:06:32,719
I was quiet.

74
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:35,692
Yeah, you're good at quiet.

75
00:06:35,727 --> 00:06:40,245
Guess you kind of have to be with me
crashing here and Rita's mom over there.

76
00:06:40,754 --> 00:06:42,720
You and Rita fuck quiet, too ?

77
00:06:42,782 --> 00:06:45,014
And she's off,
right out of the gate.

78
00:06:45,627 --> 00:06:47,908
Because me,
I wake the goddamn dead.

79
00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:50,508
- It's a problem.
- I know, only too well.

80
00:06:50,571 --> 00:06:51,945
Scary, right ?

81
00:06:52,127 --> 00:06:54,017
Sometimes I disturb myself.

82
00:06:54,627 --> 00:06:57,109
So what kind
of noises does Rita make ?

83
00:06:57,428 --> 00:06:59,578
Could we not talk about sex...

84
00:07:00,834 --> 00:07:01,904
Or Rita ?

85
00:07:02,728 --> 00:07:03,928
Why ?

86
00:07:06,855 --> 00:07:08,483
'Cause we broke up.

87
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:10,435
For real.

88
00:07:12,628 --> 00:07:13,778
It's over.

89
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:19,048
You break up, you get back together.
That's just what goes on.

90
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,608
I mean, you and Rita are forever.

91
00:07:21,776 --> 00:07:23,803
Say you're sorry
and send some flowers.

92
00:07:23,838 --> 00:07:25,263
You're not hearing me.

93
00:07:28,524 --> 00:07:32,778
When all this blows over, I'll spend
a few days at Gabriel's, and...

94
00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:36,618
You can screw Rita
as loud as you want.

95
00:07:49,327 --> 00:07:52,093
- Big news, Dex.
- Feel like I got caught in a wave.

96
00:07:52,128 --> 00:07:56,140
<i>The Miami Tribune received
a 32-page manifesto in the mail.</i>

97
00:07:56,148 --> 00:07:59,106
It's looking good
for the Bay Harbor Butcher.

98
00:07:59,157 --> 00:08:02,471
- I've heard that one before.
- Look, this may be legit.

99
00:08:02,498 --> 00:08:06,512
The manifesto includes the names
of 3 victims we never released.

100
00:08:07,627 --> 00:08:09,098
That is big news.

101
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,431
<i>I'm heading over to the Tribune now
for special agent Lundy.</i>

102
00:08:12,466 --> 00:08:14,572
He put me in charge of the team.

103
00:08:14,607 --> 00:08:16,678
- Go, Angel.
- Yeah, I'm psyched.

104
00:08:18,628 --> 00:08:21,698
<i>Yeah, me too.
I'm about to be published.</i>

105
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:25,615
<i>I sent that manifesto to the Tribune.</i>

106
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:29,207
<i>Guess I've been taking some cues
from Lila lately,</i>

107
00:08:29,228 --> 00:08:30,878
<i>and not just in bed.</i>

108
00:08:31,327 --> 00:08:34,249
<i>I'm tired of reacting
to the moves of agent Lundy</i>

109
00:08:34,284 --> 00:08:35,678
<i>and his super posse.</i>

110
00:08:36,428 --> 00:08:39,278
<i>Time to control their actions
for a change.</i>

111
00:09:02,228 --> 00:09:05,443
Betsy Court, 16.
Blunt-force beating.

112
00:09:05,927 --> 00:09:09,003
Looks like she was sunning herself
and never saw it coming.

113
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,610
Who called in the body ?

114
00:09:10,914 --> 00:09:14,185
Craig Wilson, the stepfather.
He's right over there.

115
00:09:18,527 --> 00:09:20,347
Wilson told the reporting officer

116
00:09:20,382 --> 00:09:23,278
that he came home for lunch
and found her that way.

117
00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:26,745
You and Dexter resolve your issues ?

118
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,839
As far as I'm concerned. Why ?
The bitch come crying to you again ?

119
00:09:30,311 --> 00:09:33,202
There's blood work to be done,
and if you can't control yourself,

120
00:09:33,237 --> 00:09:35,093
I need to call in
another detective.

121
00:09:35,128 --> 00:09:37,293
I won't say anything to hurt
the girl's feelings.

122
00:09:37,328 --> 00:09:40,508
- Goddamn it, I'm not joking.
- Do I look like I'm laughing ?

123
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:45,055
- I wish you would. You used to.
- Bullshit. I never laughed.

124
00:09:46,126 --> 00:09:47,947
Yeah, you're probably right.

125
00:09:49,027 --> 00:09:53,588
I'm not gonna try to scare you anymore.
Reality is you're out of free passes.

126
00:09:53,623 --> 00:09:56,455
I already stopped Dexter from filing
a complaint against you once.

127
00:09:56,517 --> 00:09:59,041
- I never asked you to do that.
- I did it,

128
00:09:59,103 --> 00:10:02,085
out of my own concern
over your obsessive behavior.

129
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,004
I'm on the line,
so if you bully Dexter in any way,

130
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:08,450
if you even look at him wrong,
I won't be responsible for the fallout.

131
00:10:08,485 --> 00:10:10,511
- You got it ?
- I got it.

132
00:10:11,727 --> 00:10:14,825
- You're backing the fucking freaktard.
- James.

133
00:10:25,827 --> 00:10:27,445
Where you been, Dexter ?

134
00:10:29,027 --> 00:10:30,698
You don't bring me doughnuts.

135
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,708
You don't sing me love songs.

136
00:10:32,862 --> 00:10:34,555
How are you, Camilla ?

137
00:10:36,527 --> 00:10:37,913
I've been better.

138
00:10:38,834 --> 00:10:40,912
Well, that doesn't sound good.

139
00:10:45,527 --> 00:10:48,466
Sergeant Doakes dropped by
my file room yesterday.

140
00:10:48,727 --> 00:10:52,778
He requested the case files
for the 1973 shipping-yard murders.

141
00:10:53,347 --> 00:10:56,708
I gave him the same line I gave you
when you came sniffing around,

142
00:10:56,712 --> 00:11:00,350
said all that old stuff was boxed up
in the basement of city hall.

143
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:02,778
That made him real angry.

144
00:11:04,707 --> 00:11:06,203
He scared me, Dexter.

145
00:11:07,428 --> 00:11:10,078
That's not right.
He shouldn't do that.

146
00:11:11,765 --> 00:11:16,200
I always assumed your father asked me
to destroy those files to protect you.

147
00:11:17,528 --> 00:11:18,555
Now...

148
00:11:18,975 --> 00:11:20,972
I'm not sure what's going on.

149
00:11:21,227 --> 00:11:23,788
- Camilla...
- Now, I don't want to know.

150
00:11:23,823 --> 00:11:25,628
I just don't want to get fired.

151
00:11:26,927 --> 00:11:29,623
I'm retiring next year.
Did I tell you ?

152
00:11:29,627 --> 00:11:32,551
I've been looking forward
to staying home with Gene.

153
00:11:32,937 --> 00:11:36,008
You won't lose your retirement.
I won't let that happen.

154
00:11:36,043 --> 00:11:39,856
I can stall Sergeant Doakes
for a few days,

155
00:11:40,057 --> 00:11:44,053
but eventually, he'll figure out
the file's missing, just like you did.

156
00:11:44,088 --> 00:11:46,857
And he'll track it back to me,
just like you did.

157
00:11:47,128 --> 00:11:48,734
I'll take care of this.

158
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:50,487
You have my word.

159
00:11:57,084 --> 00:11:59,162
<i>So much for threatening Doakes.</i>

160
00:11:59,197 --> 00:12:03,588
<i>He won't back off till he exposes
the twisted branches of my family tree,</i>

161
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:06,888
<i>from my father's indiscretions
to my murderous brother</i>

162
00:12:06,923 --> 00:12:08,852
<i>to the root of all evil...</i>

163
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,543
<i>me.</i>

164
00:12:27,027 --> 00:12:30,002
<i>- Why aren't you at the Tribune ?
- What for ?</i>

165
00:12:30,527 --> 00:12:33,339
Our guy's not gonna leave
dna evidence on a document.

166
00:12:33,364 --> 00:12:34,944
But the thrill of the hunt.

167
00:12:34,979 --> 00:12:37,741
I've had that particular thrill.
I'll leave it to younger men.

168
00:12:38,165 --> 00:12:39,365
Besides,

169
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:42,029
it's easier for me
to do my part from here.

170
00:12:42,064 --> 00:12:43,792
Yeah ? What part is that ?

171
00:12:43,827 --> 00:12:46,959
Operating on favors,
political leanings,

172
00:12:47,077 --> 00:12:48,479
posturing.

173
00:12:49,928 --> 00:12:52,678
I've been trying to find
the right music.

174
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:55,869
Right.

175
00:12:56,327 --> 00:12:59,699
So, I'm off duty today,
but here are those marina reports.

176
00:12:59,784 --> 00:13:03,267
And after my workout, I'll swing by
and pick up a copy of the manifesto.

177
00:13:04,872 --> 00:13:06,592
Look at that board.

178
00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:09,567
These kills are precise,

179
00:13:10,253 --> 00:13:13,702
but there's also a fluidity,
even some improvisation.

180
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:17,278
If I could just find the music...

181
00:13:18,608 --> 00:13:20,493
Want to borrow my Ipod ?

182
00:13:22,588 --> 00:13:24,038
Got any Chopin ?

183
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:27,474
No. Fresh out of Chopin.

184
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,490
Shit.

185
00:13:29,722 --> 00:13:31,351
Chopin's perfect.

186
00:13:31,627 --> 00:13:33,172
Did you just swear ?

187
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,508
What can I say ?
You're rubbing off on me, Morgan.

188
00:13:37,828 --> 00:13:39,698
But Chopin is perfect.

189
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,949
So this is how you do what you do.

190
00:13:47,384 --> 00:13:50,631
The truth speaks to me
from a peaceful place.

191
00:13:51,827 --> 00:13:53,837
I got to set the stage to hear it.

192
00:13:53,858 --> 00:13:55,361
You know what I mean ?

193
00:13:58,728 --> 00:14:00,278
I thrive on chaos.

194
00:14:08,228 --> 00:14:09,978
But this is good, too.

195
00:14:24,928 --> 00:14:26,478
I didn't kill her.

196
00:14:27,814 --> 00:14:29,895
I was just trying
to stop the blood.

197
00:14:33,315 --> 00:14:35,187
<i>No forceful impact spatter,</i>

198
00:14:35,222 --> 00:14:37,570
<i>he's telling the truth, I can tell.</i>

199
00:14:38,148 --> 00:14:39,519
Palms up, please.

200
00:14:44,028 --> 00:14:46,922
When I found Betsy,
she was still breathing.

201
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,100
I wanted to help her.

202
00:14:51,812 --> 00:14:53,544
You believe me, right ?

203
00:14:53,832 --> 00:14:56,338
I'm just the lab guy,
Mr. Wilson. Sorry.

204
00:14:58,027 --> 00:15:00,092
Arms down at your sides, please.

205
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,678
<i>Blood misting.</i>

206
00:15:10,428 --> 00:15:13,178
I need to collect his shirt
for evidence.

207
00:15:24,303 --> 00:15:27,494
The girl's mother was at work but she
isn't really defending her husband.

208
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:30,314
Wilson and his stepdaughter
fought all the time.

209
00:15:30,351 --> 00:15:32,825
The neighbors heard him yelling
at her this morning,

210
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,300
then he comes home for lunch,
motive and opportunity.

211
00:15:35,627 --> 00:15:38,688
- What'd the blood say ?
- The one on his hands could have come

212
00:15:38,723 --> 00:15:41,265
from trying to help her,
like he claims.

213
00:15:43,497 --> 00:15:46,778
But I did detect blood mist
on his shirt.

214
00:15:47,427 --> 00:15:48,682
A blood mist ?

215
00:15:48,927 --> 00:15:51,643
The kind that comes from beating
on a teenage girl ?

216
00:15:51,904 --> 00:15:52,904
<i>No.</i>

217
00:15:52,946 --> 00:15:53,860
Yes.

218
00:15:54,227 --> 00:15:55,856
You're absolutely sure ?

219
00:15:56,127 --> 00:15:59,318
<i>It's too fine for a bludgeoning.
The mist is from a bludgeoning.</i>

220
00:15:59,927 --> 00:16:02,696
Medium-velocity impact spatters,
no doubt about it.

221
00:16:04,127 --> 00:16:08,173
Okay, Morgan. Make sure you get me
your blood report as soon as possible.

222
00:16:15,027 --> 00:16:17,402
<i>This is my chance
to make Doakes go away</i>

223
00:16:17,437 --> 00:16:20,343
<i>without spilling a single drop
of his blood.</i>

224
00:16:20,609 --> 00:16:24,159
<i>Of course, I have to sell
an innocent man down the river.</i>

225
00:16:25,428 --> 00:16:28,778
<i>Sorry, Mr. Wilson, but I won't
let you float too far.</i>

226
00:16:38,734 --> 00:16:40,606
I was just thinking about you.

227
00:16:40,858 --> 00:16:42,893
<i>I like the sound of that.</i>

228
00:16:42,928 --> 00:16:46,178
Yeah, I had to do a little
creative problem-solving

229
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,075
at someone else's expense.

230
00:16:48,137 --> 00:16:49,328
<i>Bravo.</i>

231
00:16:49,527 --> 00:16:51,708
<i>Yeah, I figured you'd like that.</i>

232
00:16:51,737 --> 00:16:52,793
<i>What's up ?</i>

233
00:16:52,828 --> 00:16:55,378
Well, you know
that art installation

234
00:16:55,413 --> 00:16:56,917
I've been working on ?

235
00:16:57,128 --> 00:16:58,478
The cannibals.

236
00:16:58,628 --> 00:17:02,122
<i>They're not cannibals.
How barbaric !</i>

237
00:17:02,943 --> 00:17:07,379
Their eating is symbolic of the way
we consume others to feed our needs.

238
00:17:07,582 --> 00:17:09,753
<i>- That's what I meant.
- Well...</i>

239
00:17:10,494 --> 00:17:11,835
it sold.

240
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:14,666
I didn't even create it
to sell, but one of my buyers

241
00:17:14,745 --> 00:17:17,588
<i>fell in love with it,
and I named an outrageous price,</i>

242
00:17:17,623 --> 00:17:20,183
<i>and she paid me a deposit
on the spot.</i>

243
00:17:20,728 --> 00:17:21,928
So...

244
00:17:23,427 --> 00:17:25,446
You in the mood to celebrate ?

245
00:17:33,828 --> 00:17:35,028
Definitely.

246
00:17:49,927 --> 00:17:53,088
I'm afraid we can't seat you tonigh
twithout a reservation.

247
00:17:53,123 --> 00:17:55,726
As you can see, we are
completely at capacity.

248
00:17:56,637 --> 00:18:00,508
No, I'm sorry. You have to help us.
I made this reservation 2 months ago.

249
00:18:00,752 --> 00:18:03,100
This is our 10-year anniversary.

250
00:18:03,428 --> 00:18:06,578
This is the place where Dexter
proposed to me,

251
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,860
on the patio,
in front of the fountain.

252
00:18:11,428 --> 00:18:14,506
He told me to make a wish,
and when I looked down,

253
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:16,788
there was my diamond ring,

254
00:18:16,834 --> 00:18:18,856
sparkling under the water.

255
00:18:20,328 --> 00:18:22,249
That is so romantic.

256
00:18:24,527 --> 00:18:26,139
In case you're wondering,

257
00:18:26,174 --> 00:18:28,878
there's nothing sparkling
under that water tonight.

258
00:18:28,928 --> 00:18:31,208
I'm sure you'll dazzle me somehow.

259
00:18:31,828 --> 00:18:34,778
You're a creative problem-solver
now, right ?

260
00:18:35,128 --> 00:18:37,778
A changed man,
or at least "changing".

261
00:18:39,128 --> 00:18:40,278
I suppose.

262
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:43,191
There's no supposing
about it, Dexter.

263
00:18:43,227 --> 00:18:47,444
You've taken control of your addiction
in a way that few people do.

264
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:52,574
It's been about a week since
we've even discussed your recovery.

265
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:55,160
I think you're right.

266
00:18:56,227 --> 00:19:00,975
- And you haven't felt the need to use ?
- Incredibly, no. I feel...

267
00:19:03,617 --> 00:19:06,591
You know, like I'm finally
in control of things again.

268
00:19:08,228 --> 00:19:11,615
We call that warm fuzzy feeling
the pink cloud.

269
00:19:12,427 --> 00:19:16,056
It's when an addict experiences
acceptance for the first time.

270
00:19:18,127 --> 00:19:20,215
You're saying it won't last ?

271
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:23,730
I'm saying that you have
to work it, that's all.

272
00:19:24,628 --> 00:19:26,578
But I know that you will,

273
00:19:27,046 --> 00:19:30,108
because I believe that
we've found a true substitute

274
00:19:30,115 --> 00:19:31,762
for your addiction.

275
00:19:32,965 --> 00:19:34,118
What's that ?

276
00:19:35,858 --> 00:19:37,028
Life.

277
00:19:46,128 --> 00:19:48,278
You're making us all look bad.

278
00:19:49,127 --> 00:19:52,788
I'm the manager of il Bistro Vino.
Happy anniversary. On the house.

279
00:19:52,823 --> 00:19:53,878
Thank you.

280
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:56,788
Did you hear that, darling ?

281
00:19:56,823 --> 00:19:58,578
I heard it, darling.

282
00:19:59,428 --> 00:20:01,078
Enjoy your evening.

283
00:20:01,128 --> 00:20:02,278
Thank you.

284
00:20:04,027 --> 00:20:05,814
Happy anniversary, my love.

285
00:20:06,327 --> 00:20:09,134
- Aren't we in recovery ?
- This ? It's just bubbles.

286
00:20:09,169 --> 00:20:11,111
We're not gonna shoot it up,
are we ?

287
00:20:13,427 --> 00:20:15,288
You really have a way.
You know that ?

288
00:20:15,323 --> 00:20:16,366
A way of what ?

289
00:20:16,627 --> 00:20:18,854
- Of whatever the hell you want.
- Well,

290
00:20:19,908 --> 00:20:22,423
here's to 10 more glorious years

291
00:20:22,428 --> 00:20:24,478
of whatever the hell I want.

292
00:20:31,409 --> 00:20:34,915
Hi, I'm Cody,
and I researched Saudi Arabia

293
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:37,888
- for my cultural report.
- That's good, sweetie.

294
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:41,683
Now, look at me when you talk,
and try and stand up straight.

295
00:20:42,827 --> 00:20:44,102
My board

296
00:20:44,173 --> 00:20:47,959
is covered in sand because
Saudi Arabia is one big desert.

297
00:20:47,994 --> 00:20:50,239
One great big desert.

298
00:20:50,379 --> 00:20:52,027
One great big desert.

299
00:20:52,228 --> 00:20:55,530
It only rains in a tiny corner
of the country,

300
00:20:55,827 --> 00:20:57,565
so they save rainwater...

301
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,902
Okay, try and keep
your fingers off your face.

302
00:20:59,937 --> 00:21:02,496
You don't want people to think
you're picking your nose.

303
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:04,208
You mean like this ?

304
00:21:06,727 --> 00:21:09,252
Cody, you need
to take this seriously.

305
00:21:10,189 --> 00:21:12,339
Dexter said it should be fun.

306
00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:15,503
Dexter does drugs. He's wrong.

307
00:21:15,927 --> 00:21:17,806
I finished my homework.

308
00:21:17,927 --> 00:21:19,179
For the week ?

309
00:21:22,327 --> 00:21:23,393
Hey, I'm home.

310
00:21:23,428 --> 00:21:24,935
- Mom !
- Sorry I'm late.

311
00:21:24,997 --> 00:21:26,728
I'm so happy to see you !

312
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:27,828
Mom !

313
00:21:29,265 --> 00:21:30,963
What a greeting.

314
00:21:31,027 --> 00:21:33,402
Okay, why don't you guys
go get ready for bed ?

315
00:21:33,827 --> 00:21:36,613
- Really, mom ? I just got home.
- They need their rest.

316
00:21:37,227 --> 00:21:40,007
I will be in in just a minute
to check on you.

317
00:21:42,828 --> 00:21:45,378
Those two are making
great progress.

318
00:21:45,528 --> 00:21:48,917
- Progress towards what ?
- Their full potential !

319
00:21:54,127 --> 00:21:57,488
I know you're good at these things,
but now that you're here,

320
00:21:57,523 --> 00:22:00,188
have you thought about applying
for a teaching job ?

321
00:22:00,223 --> 00:22:02,478
No, I'm through with the schools.

322
00:22:03,227 --> 00:22:05,392
Well, I thought teaching
was your life.

323
00:22:05,427 --> 00:22:08,318
And your children are going
to be the beneficiaries

324
00:22:08,353 --> 00:22:09,896
of all that I have to offer.

325
00:22:13,827 --> 00:22:18,578
<i>Our injunction stopped The Tribune
from publishing the manifesto for now.</i>

326
00:22:19,127 --> 00:22:20,391
At the very least,

327
00:22:20,426 --> 00:22:23,878
we'll have time to get a jump on things
before the news frenzy hits.

328
00:22:24,045 --> 00:22:25,045
So,

329
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:27,769
let's take advantage
of this window.

330
00:22:27,827 --> 00:22:30,488
Our goal for the next 48 hours
is to wade through

331
00:22:30,523 --> 00:22:32,753
this shining piece
of social commentary.

332
00:22:32,927 --> 00:22:36,199
I've never seen so many dense
and convoluted ideas in my life,

333
00:22:36,317 --> 00:22:39,278
but we need to search them all
for clues to his identity.

334
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,821
- So, first impressions ?
- I got something.

335
00:22:43,127 --> 00:22:45,888
There are a lot of literary
references in this document.

336
00:22:45,923 --> 00:22:47,726
- How do you know ?
- I like to read books.

337
00:22:47,788 --> 00:22:50,823
- What kind of books ?
- All kinds. Who cares ?

338
00:22:51,678 --> 00:22:52,878
Anyway.

339
00:22:53,721 --> 00:22:56,100
I see lots of references,
like this one.

340
00:22:56,528 --> 00:22:58,678
"You can't depend on your eyes

341
00:22:59,428 --> 00:23:02,078
"when your imagination
is out of focus".

342
00:23:03,435 --> 00:23:04,720
He's a Trekker !

343
00:23:04,755 --> 00:23:07,108
<i>That shit's straight
from Deep Space Nine.</i>

344
00:23:07,143 --> 00:23:09,319
What ? Mark Twain said that.

345
00:23:09,573 --> 00:23:11,498
It's one of his most famous quotes.

346
00:23:11,533 --> 00:23:15,188
<i>Twain was never on Deep Space Nine.
He was on Next Generation.</i>

347
00:23:15,223 --> 00:23:18,131
<i>- He didn't say it on Star Trek.
- So what's it from ?</i>

348
00:23:18,227 --> 00:23:20,467
"A connecticut yankee
in king Arthur's court".

349
00:23:23,846 --> 00:23:26,820
What other literary quotes
are in that manifesto ?

350
00:23:33,228 --> 00:23:36,778
This guy, he's the best boxing
student I have ever had.

351
00:23:37,427 --> 00:23:40,504
After four weeks, he's getting
in shots to my head.

352
00:23:40,528 --> 00:23:44,324
Finally he says, "I think I'm ready".
I'm like, ready for what ?"

353
00:23:45,428 --> 00:23:46,756
And he says:

354
00:23:46,879 --> 00:23:48,952
"To kick my mom's ass".

355
00:23:49,621 --> 00:23:51,928
I'm like:
"You're learning how to box

356
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:54,236
"because you want to beat up
your mom ?"

357
00:24:21,428 --> 00:24:22,878
What the fuck ?

358
00:24:23,154 --> 00:24:26,009
Did you hear what I said ?
I was gonna hit the showers.

359
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:29,278
- I'll meet you back here in 10 minutes.
- Okay, yeah, 10 minutes.

360
00:24:52,827 --> 00:24:54,608
Who the fuck are you ?

361
00:24:58,285 --> 00:24:59,555
I'm Lila.

362
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,967
Pardon my tits.

363
00:25:02,809 --> 00:25:05,573
We thought you were crashing
at your boyfriend's tonight.

364
00:25:06,027 --> 00:25:07,324
We ? We who ?

365
00:25:08,434 --> 00:25:09,784
Dexter and I.

366
00:25:11,528 --> 00:25:13,878
Could you... wait here a minute ?

367
00:25:19,128 --> 00:25:20,578
Who's the skank ?

368
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:24,365
- Did knocking occur to you ?
- Who is she ?

369
00:25:25,111 --> 00:25:27,386
And are you trying to fuck her
or set her on fire ?

370
00:25:28,376 --> 00:25:30,767
I didn't do this to you when you
were riding

371
00:25:30,802 --> 00:25:32,816
square-jaw guy with the handcuffs.

372
00:25:32,927 --> 00:25:36,092
That's different. I wasn't cheating
on anyone with Gabriel.

373
00:25:36,227 --> 00:25:39,008
How could you do this to Rita,
not to mention her kids ?

374
00:25:39,016 --> 00:25:42,484
<i>- You're like their father.
- Rita broke up with me, okay ?</i>

375
00:25:43,904 --> 00:25:45,654
You fucked up, Dex...

376
00:25:47,428 --> 00:25:48,778
big-time.

377
00:25:50,461 --> 00:25:51,587
Excuse me.

378
00:26:06,527 --> 00:26:07,908
Don't worry.

379
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,097
She just needs some time
to adjust, that's all.

380
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:18,902
I had officers tear apart
the stepfather's house

381
00:26:18,937 --> 00:26:21,315
No murder weapon, but he had
to hide it somewhere.

382
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:23,498
- Where's Wilson now ?
- Interview room 2.

383
00:26:23,533 --> 00:26:25,134
We still have him ?

384
00:26:25,592 --> 00:26:28,346
- Why didn't his lawyer post bond ?
- Well, he tried, but...

385
00:26:28,381 --> 00:26:31,101
I pulled in a favor at the court
and got a bail enhancement,

386
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:33,514
so they had to start
the paperwork all over again.

387
00:26:33,549 --> 00:26:35,610
I'll break that cocksucker today.

388
00:26:36,573 --> 00:26:38,796
What evidence you say
we got on this guy ?

389
00:26:38,831 --> 00:26:42,038
He was dripping in the victim's blood.
He was home alone with her.

390
00:26:42,073 --> 00:26:44,625
- They fought the morning of the murder.
- Circumstantial.

391
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:48,216
But the blood spatter on his shirt was
a result of a blunt-force beating.

392
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,137
I'd like to see the blood report.

393
00:26:51,405 --> 00:26:53,230
You'll get it as soon as I do.

394
00:26:53,463 --> 00:26:56,360
If you're looking for me,
I'll be questioning the suspect.

395
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,948
<i>They're still playing my tune.</i>

396
00:27:19,067 --> 00:27:21,874
<i>It's like I'm conducting
a final symphony,</i>

397
00:27:21,909 --> 00:27:23,978
<i>"requiem for demonic Dexter,"</i>

398
00:27:31,098 --> 00:27:33,137
<i>and forming the entire brass section</i>

399
00:27:33,588 --> 00:27:35,338
<i>sergeant James Doakes.</i>

400
00:27:35,827 --> 00:27:37,183
<i>When I reach the end,</i>

401
00:27:37,243 --> 00:27:40,683
<i>maybe I can lay to rest the monster
formerly known as Dexter.</i>

402
00:27:43,363 --> 00:27:45,613
<i>Just hang in there, Mr. Wilson.</i>

403
00:27:59,724 --> 00:28:03,860
I've asked a psycholinguist at M.I.T.
to analyze our manifesto.

404
00:28:04,241 --> 00:28:06,975
His computer tabulates punctuation,

405
00:28:07,064 --> 00:28:08,906
misspellings and sentence structure

406
00:28:08,983 --> 00:28:11,394
to identify a set of key words,
which he'll use

407
00:28:11,429 --> 00:28:13,636
to create a profile of our killer.

408
00:28:14,729 --> 00:28:16,129
Complicated.

409
00:28:16,503 --> 00:28:17,723
Stay on it.

410
00:28:18,453 --> 00:28:21,077
Okay, we've been at this too long.

411
00:28:21,109 --> 00:28:22,861
It's 1:00.

412
00:28:23,325 --> 00:28:25,040
Let's break for lunch.

413
00:28:35,627 --> 00:28:38,714
- Are you alright ?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

414
00:28:40,332 --> 00:28:42,608
Anything you want to talk about ?

415
00:28:43,368 --> 00:28:44,818
No, not really.

416
00:28:45,227 --> 00:28:47,419
- If you change your mind.
- It's my brother.

417
00:28:48,057 --> 00:28:49,863
He was dating this chick,

418
00:28:50,003 --> 00:28:52,174
supersweet, a little doe-eyed.

419
00:28:52,234 --> 00:28:55,760
But, God, for him, fucking perfect,
and he just threw her away.

420
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:58,430
I'm just pissed at Dexter,
not to mention my boyfriend,

421
00:28:58,537 --> 00:29:00,265
who did absolutely nothing wrong.

422
00:29:00,327 --> 00:29:02,890
But every time he opened
his mouth last night,

423
00:29:02,925 --> 00:29:06,021
- I wanted to fucking slap him.
- You've been listening to Chopin.

424
00:29:06,302 --> 00:29:08,318
Yeah, I downloaded a Chopin.

425
00:29:08,818 --> 00:29:11,765
"Nocturne Number 2
in E flat major".

426
00:29:12,104 --> 00:29:13,529
One of my favorites.

427
00:29:13,848 --> 00:29:15,107
It...

428
00:29:15,387 --> 00:29:17,409
can have this effect on people.

429
00:29:17,444 --> 00:29:19,328
It can stir up some dust.

430
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:21,678
No shit.

431
00:29:28,928 --> 00:29:32,134
<i>Listen, you can heal yourself, sir.</i>

432
00:29:33,458 --> 00:29:35,789
<i>You just need to talk to me.</i>

433
00:29:35,824 --> 00:29:39,093
<i>Get it off you, otherwise, it'll haunt
you for the rest of your life.</i>

434
00:29:39,128 --> 00:29:40,930
<i>Why don't you just listen to me ?</i>

435
00:29:40,965 --> 00:29:42,596
<i>I didn't do this.</i>

436
00:29:42,631 --> 00:29:46,187
<i>You can't say it and make it true.</i>

437
00:29:46,752 --> 00:29:48,342
<i>You have a conscience,</i>

438
00:29:48,377 --> 00:29:50,761
<i>and it's really fucking
with you right now.</i>

439
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:54,007
<i>- I wish it were me. I wish I were dead.
- Yeah.</i>

440
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,418
Why are we questioning that guy ?

441
00:29:56,453 --> 00:29:58,042
He's a murder suspect.

442
00:29:58,077 --> 00:29:59,742
No, he's not. He's innocent.

443
00:30:01,577 --> 00:30:04,202
- What did you say ?
- My blood report backed his story.

444
00:30:04,237 --> 00:30:05,902
Mr. Wilson found her dead,

445
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:08,249
like I told sergeant Doakes
at the crime scene.

446
00:30:08,311 --> 00:30:11,003
You turned in the blood report ?
When ?

447
00:30:11,283 --> 00:30:14,214
I don't know, at some point
before I went home last night.

448
00:30:14,276 --> 00:30:17,842
I put it right on the sergeant's desk,
just like he asked.

449
00:30:17,903 --> 00:30:19,679
It's a green folder.

450
00:30:22,977 --> 00:30:24,934
According to my findings, the mist

451
00:30:24,994 --> 00:30:27,245
on the stepfather's shirt was exhaled

452
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,513
from the victim when he tried
to revive her.

453
00:30:29,548 --> 00:30:32,224
The autopsy confirmed she had
severe internal bleeding,

454
00:30:32,259 --> 00:30:33,668
due to the bludgeoning.

455
00:30:33,703 --> 00:30:35,856
But he could have beaten her first.

456
00:30:36,451 --> 00:30:38,072
That's impossible.

457
00:30:38,132 --> 00:30:41,706
The crime-scene photos show blood
radiating outward

458
00:30:41,741 --> 00:30:43,223
around the victim's body.

459
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:47,288
Such a bludgeoning would've covered
the killer in blood from head to toe.

460
00:30:49,093 --> 00:30:50,303
Thanks.

461
00:30:54,791 --> 00:30:56,631
Mr. Wilson, you're free to go.

462
00:30:56,965 --> 00:30:58,800
Lieutenant, this man is a killer.

463
00:30:58,862 --> 00:31:01,261
This man has been through enough
for one day.

464
00:31:02,683 --> 00:31:04,493
There's an officer in the hallway.

465
00:31:04,528 --> 00:31:07,600
He'll see that you get your personal
belongings back and take you home.

466
00:31:07,668 --> 00:31:10,218
Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you so much.

467
00:31:19,201 --> 00:31:22,404
- What are you doing ?
- Trying to save your career.

468
00:31:22,411 --> 00:31:25,998
<i>- Did you even check the blood report ?
- I didn't get the blood report.</i>

469
00:31:26,033 --> 00:31:29,290
It's on your desk,
and it exonerates your suspect.

470
00:31:29,291 --> 00:31:31,708
<i>We should be out there
looking for the real killer.</i>

471
00:31:31,743 --> 00:31:33,459
That's not what he told me at...

472
00:31:35,514 --> 00:31:37,092
That motherfucker.

473
00:31:38,367 --> 00:31:40,925
- He's good.
- Who ?

474
00:31:41,288 --> 00:31:42,302
Morgan.

475
00:31:43,298 --> 00:31:46,764
He planned this whole thing.
Maria, that psychopath set me up.

476
00:31:46,826 --> 00:31:49,350
Dexter again ?
You're blaming Dexter for this ?

477
00:31:49,427 --> 00:31:52,228
<i>Do you have any idea
how pathetic that sounds ?</i>

478
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:54,157
<i>This is not about Dexter !</i>

479
00:31:54,192 --> 00:31:56,757
<i>This is about the poor judgment
you have been displaying</i>

480
00:31:56,792 --> 00:31:59,122
<i>in this department for months now !</i>

481
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:05,208
- You want to work out ?
- No.

482
00:32:08,629 --> 00:32:11,018
I wasn't talking about the gym.

483
00:32:13,528 --> 00:32:16,628
You're sweet,
but I'm really not in the mood.

484
00:32:18,938 --> 00:32:20,894
So, what do you want to do ?

485
00:32:29,282 --> 00:32:31,184
I think I want to break up.

486
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,523
For real ?

487
00:32:37,397 --> 00:32:38,559
Yeah.

488
00:32:39,545 --> 00:32:41,070
Is that okay ?

489
00:32:47,077 --> 00:32:48,576
No, it's not okay.

490
00:32:48,638 --> 00:32:50,505
Fuck, what did I do ?

491
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,373
Nothing. I swear to God.

492
00:32:53,175 --> 00:32:56,043
You're... smoking hot and...

493
00:32:56,721 --> 00:32:58,295
fun and...

494
00:32:58,355 --> 00:33:00,621
soulful and...

495
00:33:01,029 --> 00:33:02,659
age apropriate.

496
00:33:03,068 --> 00:33:04,209
But what ?

497
00:33:04,244 --> 00:33:05,351
But...

498
00:33:06,088 --> 00:33:09,595
Sometimes the truth speaks
from a peaceful place.

499
00:33:11,504 --> 00:33:15,222
It's taken me a long time
to find that place, but I think I have,

500
00:33:15,677 --> 00:33:18,231
and it's telling me you're not
the right one for me.

501
00:33:26,551 --> 00:33:28,033
I'm so sorry.

502
00:33:35,083 --> 00:33:37,483
You live in a nice neighborhood.

503
00:33:37,972 --> 00:33:41,913
Yeah, I had no idea. I'm usually
passing by at 35 miles per hour.

504
00:33:41,948 --> 00:33:43,892
I'm not a real big walker.

505
00:33:45,498 --> 00:33:47,788
Everybody walks in London.

506
00:33:48,113 --> 00:33:51,116
Of course, they're usually
walking to the pub.

507
00:33:51,549 --> 00:33:53,566
How far are we going ?

508
00:33:55,644 --> 00:33:58,334
You're a bit grumpy tonight.

509
00:33:59,072 --> 00:34:00,430
What's wrong ?

510
00:34:05,378 --> 00:34:06,600
Come on.

511
00:34:07,235 --> 00:34:10,176
- Don't close up on me now.
- No, I honestly don't know.

512
00:34:10,211 --> 00:34:12,686
I mean, thanks to you,
things are...

513
00:34:13,132 --> 00:34:16,497
Actually looking up.
Some people at work have been...

514
00:34:16,959 --> 00:34:20,036
after me.
I think I have 'em under control.

515
00:34:21,901 --> 00:34:25,310
So, why the grouchiness ?

516
00:34:27,553 --> 00:34:30,618
Is it because your sister thinks
I'm a trollop ?

517
00:34:30,653 --> 00:34:32,774
It's not just...

518
00:34:33,724 --> 00:34:37,415
...Deb. It's the suddenness
of all of this.

519
00:34:39,546 --> 00:34:41,604
Losing Rita, the kids.

520
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:44,299
They've been the only thing
keeping me...

521
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:47,454
human... for a long time.

522
00:34:53,136 --> 00:34:55,578
Were they keeping you human,
though,

523
00:34:56,208 --> 00:34:58,241
or were they the ones making you feel

524
00:34:58,276 --> 00:35:00,666
like the monster that you were talking about ?

525
00:35:05,606 --> 00:35:06,878
Keep going.

526
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,899
Your friends and family
have to accept you

527
00:35:10,934 --> 00:35:13,680
for who you're evolving into
now that you're clean.

528
00:35:16,181 --> 00:35:17,777
Is that what I am ?

529
00:35:18,453 --> 00:35:19,520
Clean ?

530
00:35:22,509 --> 00:35:25,024
'cause I don't feel that way
at all.

531
00:35:27,309 --> 00:35:29,429
No, you certainly don't.

532
00:35:34,869 --> 00:35:35,954
God.

533
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,063
I wish I could fuck you right now.

534
00:35:49,777 --> 00:35:51,253
Whose house is this ?

535
00:35:51,288 --> 00:35:53,605
- Couldn't tell you.
- God.

536
00:35:54,511 --> 00:35:56,792
He's a man of many talents.

537
00:36:26,168 --> 00:36:28,694
Look. I'm some old bitch.

538
00:36:29,003 --> 00:36:31,765
Better not press our luck.
We should go.

539
00:36:38,851 --> 00:36:40,270
<i>Hi, Dexter.</i>

540
00:36:41,262 --> 00:36:42,311
Cody ?

541
00:36:43,417 --> 00:36:46,023
Can you come to my school tomorrow ?

542
00:36:46,647 --> 00:36:48,792
What's at your school, buddy ?

543
00:36:48,827 --> 00:36:50,937
<i>I'm doing my cultural report.</i>

544
00:36:52,528 --> 00:36:54,272
Saudi Arabia.

545
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:58,035
Can you watch me ?
I'm kind of scared.

546
00:36:58,623 --> 00:37:00,202
<i>Cody, what are you doing ?</i>

547
00:37:03,566 --> 00:37:04,749
Who is this ?

548
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:18,389
Who was that ?

549
00:37:20,686 --> 00:37:24,554
Rita's son. He wants me to come
see him at school tomorrow.

550
00:37:26,141 --> 00:37:27,566
Poor kid.

551
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:30,893
He doesn't understand
that you've gone.

552
00:37:33,997 --> 00:37:35,506
I think I'll go.

553
00:37:41,528 --> 00:37:43,542
Whatever you think's best.

554
00:37:53,287 --> 00:37:54,609
Hey, guys !

555
00:37:55,036 --> 00:37:56,206
I'm home !

556
00:38:00,051 --> 00:38:02,598
- Hello ?
- They're in bed.

557
00:38:03,208 --> 00:38:04,558
Why so early ?

558
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:09,070
Cody is being punished for sneaking away
to make a phone call without permission.

559
00:38:09,499 --> 00:38:12,359
Astor joined him in a misguided
show of support.

560
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:14,860
Well, who was Cody calling ?

561
00:38:16,778 --> 00:38:18,989
He was trying to invite him
to his school.

562
00:38:19,051 --> 00:38:20,798
Can you imagine ?

563
00:38:22,407 --> 00:38:24,245
Mom, we need to have a talk.

564
00:38:24,868 --> 00:38:27,393
I made a phone call
of my own today.

565
00:38:27,412 --> 00:38:29,409
I spoke with Aunt Cecilia.

566
00:38:29,523 --> 00:38:33,110
She told me the school district
fired you almost a year ago.

567
00:38:36,718 --> 00:38:39,161
We had philosophical differences.

568
00:38:39,696 --> 00:38:42,398
The educational system
is falling apart.

569
00:38:42,433 --> 00:38:46,527
School should be life itself,
not a preparation for living.

570
00:38:46,613 --> 00:38:49,463
Do you know that they give
trophies to every child now

571
00:38:49,498 --> 00:38:52,314
- whether they win or lose ?
- Yeah, I finally get it.

572
00:38:52,748 --> 00:38:55,817
It took me a few decades,
but it's not just me.

573
00:38:56,266 --> 00:38:57,964
Nobody can deal with you.

574
00:38:58,555 --> 00:39:01,240
You don't leave room
for anybody else to exist.

575
00:39:01,449 --> 00:39:05,745
It's not my fault that so many people
are willing to settle for mediocrity.

576
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:09,039
Just look at you !
First paul, then Dexter.

577
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:11,831
Rita, you lack even common sense,

578
00:39:11,866 --> 00:39:14,212
and now you're passing that torch

579
00:39:14,272 --> 00:39:17,123
of ordinary character
on to your children.

580
00:39:17,527 --> 00:39:19,049
Shut the fuck up.

581
00:39:21,155 --> 00:39:23,179
Nobody talks about my kids
that way.

582
00:39:24,549 --> 00:39:25,557
Thatagirl.

583
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:30,471
- That's what I've been waiting to see.
- Yeah ! I'm done with you.

584
00:39:30,592 --> 00:39:31,896
No, you're not.

585
00:39:31,958 --> 00:39:34,361
But you go. You give me hell.

586
00:39:36,151 --> 00:39:37,861
No, I won't do that.

587
00:39:38,029 --> 00:39:40,781
I won't let you turn me into you.

588
00:39:41,604 --> 00:39:43,353
Here's what's gonna happen...

589
00:39:43,388 --> 00:39:46,535
First thing in the morning,
you're gonna pack up and go home.

590
00:39:46,726 --> 00:39:49,497
You'll come and visit us
for birthdays and holidays,

591
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:52,184
but you're not gonna live
with us anymore.

592
00:39:54,763 --> 00:39:56,004
Well...

593
00:39:58,514 --> 00:40:01,007
if that's what I have to sacrifice

594
00:40:01,527 --> 00:40:03,302
to get you on your feet...

595
00:40:16,185 --> 00:40:18,112
"Kill one man,
and you're a murderer.

596
00:40:18,147 --> 00:40:21,763
"Kill thousands, a conqueror.
Kill them all, and you're a God".

597
00:40:21,798 --> 00:40:25,558
Does it sound to you like our guy
has a narcissistic personality disorder,

598
00:40:25,593 --> 00:40:27,248
a classic God complex ?

599
00:40:27,283 --> 00:40:29,246
I think you're onto something.

600
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:32,319
<i>To tell you the truth,
I don't know what my alter ego</i>

601
00:40:32,354 --> 00:40:34,158
<i>had in mind when he wrote that crap.</i>

602
00:40:34,193 --> 00:40:37,063
<i>I just pulled from various
blogs on the net,</i>

603
00:40:37,098 --> 00:40:39,933
<i>mixed and matched...
Presto manifesto.</i>

604
00:40:45,871 --> 00:40:48,314
You finally decided to fight back.

605
00:40:50,753 --> 00:40:52,247
I been waiting.

606
00:40:54,323 --> 00:40:57,586
Hope you don't expect me to comment
on that so you can record it

607
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:00,700
on your hidden tape recorder.
I wasn't born yesterday.

608
00:41:00,723 --> 00:41:02,743
You might have been, for all I know.

609
00:41:02,778 --> 00:41:06,027
Your past is a bigger mystery
than fucking Jimmy Hoffa.

610
00:41:06,073 --> 00:41:08,824
I tried every avenue,
legal and otherwise,

611
00:41:09,475 --> 00:41:13,545
but there ain't no paper trail
on the early years of Dexter Morgan.

612
00:41:15,825 --> 00:41:18,910
I guess there's no recorder
running, after all.

613
00:41:18,945 --> 00:41:20,034
No, man.

614
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:23,380
Unlike you, I do everything
out in the open.

615
00:41:27,018 --> 00:41:30,307
In that case, sergeant,
let me put this in the open for you.

616
00:41:33,132 --> 00:41:37,012
No matter what you try, no matter when,
no matter how hard you work,

617
00:41:37,047 --> 00:41:40,524
I'll always be a step ahead
of you for one simple reason.

618
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:43,267
And what's that ?

619
00:41:43,613 --> 00:41:44,843
I own you.

620
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:50,147
Fuck !

621
00:42:03,442 --> 00:42:05,647
Get him off of me ! Get off me !

622
00:42:08,283 --> 00:42:10,180
Why are you doing this ?

623
00:42:19,438 --> 00:42:20,982
I want your gun,

624
00:42:21,244 --> 00:42:23,487
your badge, and your police ID.

625
00:42:23,619 --> 00:42:25,827
I want your access card, too.

626
00:42:26,094 --> 00:42:27,156
Now !

627
00:42:27,681 --> 00:42:31,360
Type a statement that sergeant Doakes
is on administrative leave,

628
00:42:31,428 --> 00:42:34,219
pending an internal affairs
investigation.

629
00:42:37,606 --> 00:42:39,790
You two, get him out of here.

630
00:42:40,973 --> 00:42:42,149
Thanks.

631
00:42:51,816 --> 00:42:53,619
What the hell happened ?

632
00:42:53,636 --> 00:42:56,415
I don't know. He... jumped me.

633
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:03,524
That guy's always had it out for me.

634
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:17,480
- Thanks for meeting with me, Don.
- I don't know what the point is.

635
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,290
The district court injunction
hearing starts in 3 hours.

636
00:43:20,352 --> 00:43:23,127
Which everyone here knows
we're going to lose.

637
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:26,490
Don't look so shocked.
We always lose these things.

638
00:43:26,743 --> 00:43:29,359
You bastards and your free speech.

639
00:43:29,498 --> 00:43:32,151
My boss never lets me say anything.

640
00:43:32,964 --> 00:43:36,660
I'll tell you what,
I will agree to dropping the injunction,

641
00:43:36,695 --> 00:43:39,685
which will save us days
of courtroom arguments

642
00:43:39,747 --> 00:43:41,520
and a boatload of legal fees,

643
00:43:41,582 --> 00:43:43,395
if we can agree

644
00:43:43,827 --> 00:43:47,250
on some simple ground rules
on how you publish that document.

645
00:43:47,285 --> 00:43:50,109
"Ground rules".
We're not gonna have any ground rules.

646
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:51,886
My only goal here

647
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:54,891
is to avoid compromising
an investigation of a mass murderer

648
00:43:56,338 --> 00:43:58,746
who could hurt a lot more people.

649
00:44:00,593 --> 00:44:02,920
Give me just a second, will you, Frank ?

650
00:44:10,413 --> 00:44:12,452
I can't believe you got those assholes

651
00:44:12,487 --> 00:44:15,506
to publish the manifesto
without the victims'names

652
00:44:15,541 --> 00:44:17,957
and as a page-3 story.

653
00:44:18,426 --> 00:44:22,061
No sense hyping it. It might just
inspire the killer to greater heights.

654
00:44:22,122 --> 00:44:23,243
Wait.

655
00:44:23,422 --> 00:44:25,018
It's quiet here...

656
00:44:25,639 --> 00:44:26,899
Peaceful.

657
00:44:28,085 --> 00:44:29,836
It's a good spot.

658
00:44:29,885 --> 00:44:31,106
For what ?

659
00:44:31,734 --> 00:44:33,064
It's 1:00.

660
00:44:36,538 --> 00:44:37,767
So it is.

661
00:44:41,998 --> 00:44:43,948
I brought my own sandwich.

662
00:44:47,534 --> 00:44:50,162
I thought you didn't like
the quiet, Morgan.

663
00:44:50,197 --> 00:44:51,393
I didn't.

664
00:44:51,884 --> 00:44:53,111
I don't.

665
00:44:55,766 --> 00:44:58,578
When I'm alone
and it's quiet, I get scared...

666
00:44:58,587 --> 00:44:59,768
Shitless,

667
00:45:01,393 --> 00:45:04,691
like I start hearing
what's really going on inside.

668
00:45:05,675 --> 00:45:06,705
I see.

669
00:45:07,904 --> 00:45:12,470
So if it's all the same to you, maybe
I can just practice when you're around.

670
00:45:16,328 --> 00:45:19,574
'cause when you're around, I kind of
feel like I can deal with anything,

671
00:45:19,609 --> 00:45:21,081
you know ?

672
00:45:22,062 --> 00:45:24,113
Like what happened to me.

673
00:45:26,225 --> 00:45:28,423
I don't have to run from it.

674
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:32,993
I don't have to jump into bed
with some guy and hide there.

675
00:45:36,707 --> 00:45:38,303
You give me strength.

676
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:48,533
I'm kind of opening up here.

677
00:45:49,948 --> 00:45:52,054
What do you want me to say ?

678
00:45:53,471 --> 00:45:54,913
I don't know.

679
00:45:56,015 --> 00:45:59,010
You're the fucking Zen master.
Figure it out.

680
00:46:05,684 --> 00:46:09,449
I've got plaque in my arteries.
I know the lyrics to elevator music.

681
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,545
My hair isn't getting any thicker.

682
00:46:49,717 --> 00:46:52,668
You're gonna do great up there.
You just have to remember something.

683
00:46:52,703 --> 00:46:55,455
- They're more frightened than you are.
- No, they're not.

684
00:46:55,490 --> 00:46:58,609
Are so. You'll be staring at them
the whole time.

685
00:46:58,644 --> 00:47:00,800
If one of those unsuspecting
moms or dads

686
00:47:00,835 --> 00:47:03,285
does something embarrassing
while you're on stage...

687
00:47:03,366 --> 00:47:06,918
- Like pick their nose ?
- You're gonna be the one who sees it.

688
00:47:06,954 --> 00:47:08,602
- Yeah.
- That's power.

689
00:47:09,508 --> 00:47:11,010
Now go have fun.

690
00:47:13,428 --> 00:47:16,232
Dexter, over here.
We saved you a seat.

691
00:47:16,427 --> 00:47:17,778
Thanks, guys.

692
00:47:24,032 --> 00:47:25,425
There you go.

693
00:47:26,042 --> 00:47:29,498
$18,000. I'll send a truck
for the piece tomorrow.

694
00:47:30,325 --> 00:47:32,007
I am telling you, Lila,

695
00:47:32,042 --> 00:47:35,128
this is going to create
a critical mass for you.

696
00:47:37,017 --> 00:47:40,509
According to the psycholinguistic
analysis of the manifesto,

697
00:47:40,571 --> 00:47:42,820
our killer is a white male

698
00:47:43,072 --> 00:47:44,370
in his 50s.

699
00:47:44,449 --> 00:47:45,548
What else ?

700
00:47:46,576 --> 00:47:48,791
The killer has no girlfriends

701
00:47:48,923 --> 00:47:51,979
- and considers himself a good catholic.
- Hold on.

702
00:47:52,041 --> 00:47:54,870
How can you tell all that
by putting words in a computer ?

703
00:47:54,905 --> 00:47:57,699
- I don't know. It's science.
- How about common sense ?

704
00:47:57,716 --> 00:48:00,267
I think the guy we're looking for
is pissed off at God.

705
00:48:00,425 --> 00:48:01,991
That's why he kills people.

706
00:48:02,026 --> 00:48:04,723
Really ? I found him
very politically motivated.

707
00:48:04,758 --> 00:48:06,610
Yeah, like a modern-day revolutionary.

708
00:48:06,642 --> 00:48:10,174
Which would suggest that
he's killing for social change.

709
00:48:17,152 --> 00:48:18,880
This is what he wants.

710
00:48:19,236 --> 00:48:22,536
- What's that ?
- Confusion, chaos...

711
00:48:22,861 --> 00:48:24,900
It's what the killer wants.

712
00:48:25,656 --> 00:48:28,014
He's always been an intensely
private figure,

713
00:48:28,107 --> 00:48:30,122
dispatching victims silently.

714
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:33,061
Now he's suddenly a media whore ?
It doesn't make sense.

715
00:48:33,639 --> 00:48:36,982
- He's creating a clusterfuck.
- Very good, officer Morgan.

716
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:41,195
The killer's making us chase our tails.
You know what that means ?

717
00:48:59,324 --> 00:49:02,418
He knows how we work.
Look how he hits every major theme.

718
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:04,872
Political, environmental, religious.

719
00:49:05,145 --> 00:49:08,764
In one section, he manages to
weave together Julius Caesar,

720
00:49:08,825 --> 00:49:11,558
Berlin, Germany, the Pittsburgh
steelers, and Gandhi.

721
00:49:11,622 --> 00:49:12,976
It's scattershot.

722
00:49:13,203 --> 00:49:16,938
He knew that this would send us
scurrying like squirrels for nuts.

723
00:49:17,003 --> 00:49:20,241
Yeah, but to suggest that
he might be one of us...

724
00:49:20,904 --> 00:49:22,432
How can you be sure ?

725
00:49:26,626 --> 00:49:30,040
Hi, I'm Cody,
and I researched Saudi Arabia

726
00:49:30,075 --> 00:49:31,869
for my cultural report.

727
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:36,687
My board is covered in sand
because Saudi Arabia is one big desert.

728
00:49:37,521 --> 00:49:41,377
As you can see, I used coffee
beans to write "Saudi Arabia".

729
00:49:41,842 --> 00:49:44,231
Arabic coffee is very famous.

730
00:49:44,373 --> 00:49:46,058
<i>I'm a little confused.</i>

731
00:49:46,093 --> 00:49:49,093
<i>Lila is the one showing me
how to take control,</i>

732
00:49:49,099 --> 00:49:52,121
<i>stop killing, get my life clean.</i>

733
00:49:52,905 --> 00:49:57,062
<i>But it's the 1st time since I went into
recovery that I actually feel clean.</i>

734
00:49:58,459 --> 00:50:02,052
The children in Saudi Arabia
are just like us, because they...

735
00:50:26,546 --> 00:50:28,818
This is the Saudi Arabian flag.

736
00:50:31,013 --> 00:50:35,081
The Arabic letters mean
"There is no God except Allah".

737
00:50:47,208 --> 00:50:50,717
Do you know how tough it is
for a woman in Saudi Arabia ?

738
00:50:50,752 --> 00:50:53,423
They can't drive or have powerful jobs.

739
00:50:59,147 --> 00:51:02,711
Or get this. They can't even go to
the movies without men's permission.

740
00:51:02,922 --> 00:51:06,786
After they turn 12, they have
to wear long black sleeves,

741
00:51:07,785 --> 00:51:10,921
and they can't hardly even talk
to men until they get married.

742
00:51:19,706 --> 00:51:22,898
The new king, Abdullah,
is trying to change some old bad rules,

743
00:51:22,975 --> 00:51:24,844
so women can do more things...

744
00:51:28,159 --> 00:51:32,796
Thank you very much for listening.
Or, as they say in Arabic, "shokran".

745
00:51:58,477 --> 00:52:00,977
I can't believe how calm
you were up there.

746
00:52:01,012 --> 00:52:03,477
Yeah, you were like
a professional talker.

747
00:52:03,512 --> 00:52:05,190
You were pretty good.

748
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:08,306
Can Dexter come for ice cream
with us ?

749
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:11,417
Can he, mom, please ?

750
00:52:13,136 --> 00:52:15,435
- Sure, Dexter can join us.
- I wouldn't miss it.

751
00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:19,094
Maybe they'll have some delicious
Saudi flavors, like sand or oil.

752
00:52:20,878 --> 00:52:22,528
Hang on a sec, guys.

753
00:52:28,318 --> 00:52:29,727
Are you hurt ?

754
00:52:31,073 --> 00:52:32,836
Okay. I'm coming now.

755
00:52:35,616 --> 00:52:37,066
I know. Me too.

756
00:52:42,008 --> 00:52:44,579
Come on, kids.
Dexter won't be joining us.

757
00:52:44,614 --> 00:52:48,058
Rita, it's an emergency.
Look, I'm so sorry, you guys.

758
00:52:48,127 --> 00:52:51,047
I'll make it up to you, but I gotta
help a friend who's in trouble.

759
00:52:51,082 --> 00:52:53,845
There was a fire at her place.
I'm so sorry.

760
00:52:55,719 --> 00:52:57,132
Hey, let's go.

761
00:53:24,979 --> 00:53:26,369
What happened ?

762
00:53:28,368 --> 00:53:30,909
I was working on my piece
with the blowtorch,

763
00:53:30,944 --> 00:53:33,450
and it just caught fire.
I was so scared.

764
00:53:33,485 --> 00:53:34,816
I guess so.

765
00:53:41,074 --> 00:53:43,585
Promise me that you won't leave me,

766
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,647
that you won't go anywhere.

767
00:53:46,467 --> 00:53:48,352
I'm not going anywhere.

768
00:53:59,930 --> 00:54:02,156
Hey, you got your light fixed.
