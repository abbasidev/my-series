1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,939
<i>Blood.
Sometimes, it sets my teeth on edge.</i>

2
00:00:17,557 --> 00:00:19,946
<i>Other times,
it helps me control the chaos.</i>

3
00:00:22,203 --> 00:00:24,146
<i>Last season on Dexter...</i>

4
00:00:24,724 --> 00:00:28,241
<i>Tonight's the night and it's going
to happen again, and again.</i>

5
00:00:28,584 --> 00:00:31,315
Open your eyes and look...
at what you did !

6
00:00:31,446 --> 00:00:33,398
Please, you have to understand.

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,372
Trust me, I definitely understand.

8
00:00:35,529 --> 00:00:38,339
Children, I could never do that,
not like you.

9
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:40,491
- Why ?
- I have standards.

10
00:00:43,274 --> 00:00:45,264
- You better be a cop.
- No, forensics.

11
00:00:45,386 --> 00:00:47,018
- They found another hooker.
- Another ?

12
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,505
That's the 3rd one in five months.

13
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:50,362
There's no blood near the body at all.

14
00:00:50,494 --> 00:00:52,183
It's the weirdest thing you ever saw.

15
00:00:52,305 --> 00:00:56,001
<i>I've never seen such
clean dry neat looking, dead flesh.</i>

16
00:00:56,185 --> 00:00:58,075
How does the killer
get rid of the blood ?

17
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:00,071
<i>I think this is a friendly message.</i>

18
00:01:00,307 --> 00:01:01,961
<i>Kind of like:
"Hey, wanna play ?"</i>

19
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:03,800
<i>And yes, I wanna play.</i>

20
00:01:03,957 --> 00:01:05,082
<i>I really, really do.</i>

21
00:01:05,204 --> 00:01:07,334
What's this sick son of a bitch
trying to tell us ?

22
00:01:07,456 --> 00:01:08,955
<i>Not us, me.</i>

23
00:01:09,077 --> 00:01:10,307
Interesting hand job.

24
00:01:10,429 --> 00:01:11,768
You think this is our guy's work ?

25
00:01:11,952 --> 00:01:13,238
The Ice Truck Killer.

26
00:01:13,396 --> 00:01:14,630
This feels familiar.

27
00:01:14,989 --> 00:01:17,878
<i>When he broke into my apartment,
he took some time to get to know me.</i>

28
00:01:18,022 --> 00:01:20,463
<i>My life, my secrets... he knows.</i>

29
00:01:20,726 --> 00:01:23,667
<i>He's not corrupting the happy
Hallmark images of my youth.</i>

30
00:01:23,811 --> 00:01:26,095
<i>He's revealing
the ugly truth behind them.</i>

31
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:29,049
Son, there are people out there
who do really bad things.

32
00:01:29,171 --> 00:01:31,237
But of course, you have to learn
how to spot them,

33
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:32,462
but I can teach you.

34
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:35,687
<i>The code of Harry,
my foster father, is satisfied.</i>

35
00:01:35,867 --> 00:01:37,921
So how the hell
was your date with Rita last night ?

36
00:01:38,053 --> 00:01:39,146
Great.

37
00:01:39,268 --> 00:01:40,869
<i>She's perfect because Rita is,</i>

38
00:01:41,105 --> 00:01:43,127
<i>in her own way,
as damaged as me.</i>

39
00:01:43,652 --> 00:01:45,543
- I want...
- a normal life.

40
00:01:46,357 --> 00:01:47,801
Yeah, a normal life.

41
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:52,003
The killer is an artist.

42
00:01:52,194 --> 00:01:54,068
You give me the fucking creeps,
you know that ?

43
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,923
Yeah, I know.
Sorry about that.

44
00:01:56,081 --> 00:01:58,024
<i>Why in a building full of cops,</i>

45
00:01:58,234 --> 00:01:59,434
<i>is Doakes,</i>

46
00:01:59,737 --> 00:02:01,771
<i>the only one
who gets the creeps from me ?</i>

47
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:03,682
I want you and Rita
to meet my boyfriend.

48
00:02:03,839 --> 00:02:05,060
Dex, Rudy's different.

49
00:02:05,217 --> 00:02:07,528
<i>I feel safe with him.
I think... I'm falling for him.</i>

50
00:02:11,261 --> 00:02:12,863
I waited a long time to meet you.

51
00:02:13,283 --> 00:02:14,937
Dad's coming home ?

52
00:02:15,331 --> 00:02:17,427
If their dad shows up,
we'll deal with it together.

53
00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:19,703
Paul Bennett, father on parole.

54
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,239
Are you fucking my wife ?

55
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,586
My heart beats for those two kids,

56
00:02:24,823 --> 00:02:27,694
so if you or that skinny bitch
try to screw with what's mine,

57
00:02:27,816 --> 00:02:29,916
I swear to God,
I don't care who I have to hurt...

58
00:02:30,074 --> 00:02:31,177
<i>Let's face it, Paul,</i>

59
00:02:31,387 --> 00:02:32,647
<i>you've been a problem.</i>

60
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,301
<i>It's time for you to go away.</i>

61
00:02:34,432 --> 00:02:35,589
He smacked me over the head,

62
00:02:35,711 --> 00:02:38,142
<i>dragged me out of the house
probably through the backyard.</i>

63
00:02:38,264 --> 00:02:40,740
<i>All I want is for you
to look for a shoe.</i>

64
00:02:40,871 --> 00:02:42,709
<i>It's missing, I'm telling you.</i>

65
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,678
Dexter is not who you think he is.

66
00:02:44,941 --> 00:02:47,024
Do I have the pleasure
of your company this weekend ?

67
00:02:47,146 --> 00:02:49,405
We've had a major break
in the Ice Truck Killer case.

68
00:02:49,653 --> 00:02:50,940
Debra Morgan...

69
00:02:51,623 --> 00:02:52,918
will you marry me ?

70
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,406
Yes, yes !

71
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:56,723
- Where's my sister ?
- Took her code 12.

72
00:02:56,882 --> 00:02:57,972
Left about an hour ago.

73
00:02:58,103 --> 00:02:59,770
How did you not know who I was ?

74
00:03:00,098 --> 00:03:02,628
I think a real cop would...

75
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:06,147
at least have a sense that she was
in the presence of the person she was...

76
00:03:06,331 --> 00:03:07,748
hunting.

77
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,764
Where the fuck are you ?
I'm here at work,

78
00:03:10,886 --> 00:03:12,523
and you're not. I need to talk to you.

79
00:03:12,645 --> 00:03:14,420
<i>Do not see Rudy until you find me.</i>

80
00:03:14,542 --> 00:03:17,334
You're connected to this. I don't know
how, but I'm gonna find out,

81
00:03:17,456 --> 00:03:19,540
and some of what I find
is gonna stick to your ass.

82
00:03:19,662 --> 00:03:21,985
I was hoping you could dig up
an old case file for me.

83
00:03:22,143 --> 00:03:23,193
Well, sure thing.

84
00:03:23,351 --> 00:03:25,306
It's the crime scene
where Harry found me.

85
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:27,985
<i>This is what he wanted me to find
all along.</i>

86
00:03:28,142 --> 00:03:29,534
<i>He's showing me where to go.</i>

87
00:03:29,901 --> 00:03:32,475
Laura Moser and three others
found chopped up with a chain saw.

88
00:03:33,885 --> 00:03:36,282
What is in that report
that Harry didn't want me to see ?

89
00:03:36,413 --> 00:03:38,671
What he saw
in that cargo container changed him.

90
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:41,348
You were left there for days,
starving,

91
00:03:42,084 --> 00:03:43,711
<i>in blood 2 inches thick.</i>

92
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,313
You remember now ?

93
00:03:47,321 --> 00:03:48,398
<i>I have a brother.</i>

94
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:49,632
A real brother.

95
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:51,351
I didn't even know you existed.

96
00:03:51,692 --> 00:03:53,845
Imagine how I felt

97
00:03:54,632 --> 00:03:57,415
when I tracked you down
and found out you were exactly like me.

98
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,093
You can't be a killer and a hero.

99
00:04:00,697 --> 00:04:02,562
It doesn't work that way !

100
00:04:08,044 --> 00:04:10,131
Why me, Dex ?
Why'd he choose me ?

101
00:04:10,762 --> 00:04:11,943
You're just lucky, I guess.

102
00:04:15,068 --> 00:04:16,670
I was so scared.

103
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:19,972
What am I,
one of your victims now ?

104
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:21,548
No, you're not a trophy...

105
00:04:22,441 --> 00:04:24,069
but you need to be put down.

106
00:04:26,078 --> 00:04:27,181
Sorry.

107
00:04:27,364 --> 00:04:29,592
<i>I drove away a brother who accepts me,</i>

108
00:04:29,714 --> 00:04:31,631
<i>for a foster father who betrayed me.</i>

109
00:04:31,867 --> 00:04:34,309
<i>I'm not alone and Harry kept it from me.</i>

110
00:04:34,676 --> 00:04:36,974
<i>Doakes always sensed
I was hiding something.</i>

111
00:04:37,105 --> 00:04:38,129
<i>Now, he knows.</i>

112
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:42,139
<i>My devil danced with his demon,
and the fiddler's tune is far from over.</i>

113
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,670
<i>Tonight's the night...</i>

114
00:06:53,565 --> 00:06:56,570
<i>and it's going to happen again,
and again.</i>

115
00:06:58,029 --> 00:06:59,799
<i>Has to happen.</i>

116
00:07:03,827 --> 00:07:05,466
<i>It's not what I want,</i>

117
00:07:05,694 --> 00:07:07,725
<i>for what I want doesn't matter.</i>

118
00:07:08,633 --> 00:07:11,532
<i>This is the only way
I know how to survive.</i>

119
00:07:17,615 --> 00:07:19,937
<i>I'm coiled and ready to strike.</i>

120
00:07:27,585 --> 00:07:29,276
<i>Although a spare will do.</i>

121
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:31,724
Nice.
Nice warmer ball.

122
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,687
Now, you can get that.
Remember.

123
00:07:33,722 --> 00:07:35,055
Loose arm swing.

124
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,186
Loose.
Got it.

125
00:07:36,221 --> 00:07:37,984
Yeah, and keep your mind limber.

126
00:07:38,019 --> 00:07:39,653
I'm doing mental Jumping Jacks.

127
00:07:39,688 --> 00:07:41,287
- Don't forget.
- Oki, doki.

128
00:07:42,648 --> 00:07:44,129
<i>I'm on edge.</i>

129
00:07:44,486 --> 00:07:46,683
<i>Thirty eight days, sixteen hours, and...</i>

130
00:07:46,718 --> 00:07:49,748
<i>twelve minutes have passed
since I killed my brother.</i>

131
00:07:50,499 --> 00:07:53,608
<i>In that entire time,
I haven't had a single night to myself.</i>

132
00:07:54,603 --> 00:07:56,846
<i>Sergeant Doakes makes sure of that.</i>

133
00:07:56,979 --> 00:07:58,506
<i>He follows me everywhere now.</i>

134
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:02,202
<i>My human bloodhound
incited by the scent of darkness.</i>

135
00:08:03,451 --> 00:08:06,430
<i>My best hope of losing him
is to act relentlessly normal.</i>

136
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,488
<i>Dull. So I bowl.</i>

137
00:08:15,678 --> 00:08:18,000
<i>What's really disturbing
is that I'm good at it.</i>

138
00:08:19,354 --> 00:08:21,571
- Holes, Dex.
- You pictured it, didn't you ?

139
00:08:26,484 --> 00:08:27,816
Hey, striker !

140
00:08:27,851 --> 00:08:29,883
We need you locked down, tonight, huh ?

141
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:31,380
We're playing the Alley Cats.

142
00:08:33,128 --> 00:08:34,819
I'm a little tense, Angel.

143
00:08:36,306 --> 00:08:38,705
But I'll try my best
not to let the team down.

144
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:40,719
<i>Try, peso, try.</i>

145
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:42,846
You gotta think positive, bro.

146
00:08:42,881 --> 00:08:45,630
Cause what we think
creates the world around us.

147
00:08:45,665 --> 00:08:48,380
It's all about energy
and interconnectedness.

148
00:08:48,415 --> 00:08:49,912
I mean, you gotta think positive.

149
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:51,435
<i>Angel lost someone too.</i>

150
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,771
<i>When his wife left him.</i>

151
00:08:52,806 --> 00:08:54,551
<i>Now, he's going toward the light,</i>

152
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:56,237
<i>searching for answers.</i>

153
00:08:56,272 --> 00:08:58,830
<i>He found one,
on an Oprah rerun.</i>

154
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,957
<i>I wish it were that easy for me.</i>

155
00:09:01,064 --> 00:09:04,042
And we just got to direct it
to manifest what we want.

156
00:09:05,965 --> 00:09:07,500
Alright.

157
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:26,510
Dude, just bowl a strike so we can go
have some fun at the strip clubs.

158
00:09:26,545 --> 00:09:28,400
I want to see a real 7-10 split.

159
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:30,251
<i>I wish I could have fun.</i>

160
00:09:30,345 --> 00:09:33,835
<i>With Doakes tailing me,
my life's been all Jekyll and no Hyde.</i>

161
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,943
<i>No moon-lit play dates,
no late night social calls.</i>

162
00:09:36,978 --> 00:09:38,168
<i>Not one.</i>

163
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:40,721
<i>My brother would be so disappointed.</i>

164
00:09:40,756 --> 00:09:43,446
Don't forget:
tell the universe what you need.

165
00:09:43,907 --> 00:09:46,872
<i>I really need... to kill somebody.</i>

166
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:02,893
Did you even take my advice ?

167
00:10:02,961 --> 00:10:05,992
I'm telling you.
The universe can be very generous.

168
00:10:17,749 --> 00:10:19,441
<i>It certainly can.</i>

169
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,699
<i>For weeks, I've known who was next.</i>

170
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,406
<i>Who belonged to me.</i>

171
00:10:27,788 --> 00:10:30,425
<i>I just needed Doakes
to take a night off.</i>

172
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,615
What do you need ?

173
00:10:45,909 --> 00:10:47,469
I need to...

174
00:10:47,983 --> 00:10:49,360
curse someone.

175
00:10:50,267 --> 00:10:51,854
What kind of curse ?

176
00:10:55,815 --> 00:10:57,349
Death curse.

177
00:11:00,804 --> 00:11:03,073
We don't do that kind of thing here.

178
00:11:03,219 --> 00:11:04,917
You can go down to Little Haiti.

179
00:11:04,952 --> 00:11:07,248
Find all
the Hoodoo Voodoo you need there.

180
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,083
You are Jimmy Senseo,
high priest, right ?

181
00:11:18,054 --> 00:11:19,851
The man with God in his mouth.

182
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,947
I'm not a tourist.

183
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:27,072
I need a Petro curse
and I heard you were the best.

184
00:11:29,095 --> 00:11:31,522
Thank you, for your offering.

185
00:11:32,002 --> 00:11:33,404
Come.

186
00:11:53,334 --> 00:11:54,664
<i>A blind man.</i>

187
00:11:54,699 --> 00:11:56,082
<i>Not very sporting, I know.</i>

188
00:11:56,117 --> 00:11:59,699
<i>But I'm not one to discriminate based
on race, gender or disability.</i>

189
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,070
What... is... happening ?

190
00:12:09,978 --> 00:12:13,192
The only pertinent question is:
what happened to your victims.

191
00:12:13,523 --> 00:12:16,370
What are you doing ? What do you want ?

192
00:12:16,495 --> 00:12:18,972
I can see how this
might be confusing for you, Jimmy,

193
00:12:19,007 --> 00:12:20,623
but my favorite part's
kinda ruined here.

194
00:12:20,658 --> 00:12:24,273
This is where I normally show you
the innocent people you killed.

195
00:12:24,613 --> 00:12:27,538
I brought them along, anyway.
That's part of my death ritual.

196
00:12:27,989 --> 00:12:30,232
Since you're blind,
I'll just remind you.

197
00:12:31,809 --> 00:12:33,632
Emmanuel Azua.

198
00:12:33,647 --> 00:12:35,504
Jean-Philippe Peguero.

199
00:12:35,677 --> 00:12:37,007
Nono Baptiste.

200
00:12:37,042 --> 00:12:38,497
I didn't kill them.

201
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,519
I cast them.

202
00:12:40,849 --> 00:12:42,573
And then a remarkable coincidence,

203
00:12:42,608 --> 00:12:46,243
they each die of respiratory failure
with fluid in their lungs.

204
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,300
I guess murder is one way
to make your curses come true.

205
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:50,708
Good for business.

206
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:54,443
What ? What was that ?

207
00:12:54,478 --> 00:12:56,196
Just the next part of the ritual.

208
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:01,382
How did you administrate
the ricin poison to your victims ?

209
00:13:07,825 --> 00:13:11,066
I am the one with the power
in these hands.

210
00:13:12,683 --> 00:13:14,197
That's not entirely accurate.

211
00:13:14,232 --> 00:13:16,790
Those who believe in me shall be free.

212
00:13:18,782 --> 00:13:20,264
Knock it off !

213
00:13:20,436 --> 00:13:22,180
How do you poison them ?

214
00:13:23,351 --> 00:13:24,990
Not me.

215
00:13:25,662 --> 00:13:27,163
Madulli,

216
00:13:27,198 --> 00:13:28,732
The Petro spirit

217
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:31,043
told me, put the powder,

218
00:13:31,202 --> 00:13:33,892
in the aguardiente bottles
that they buy from me.

219
00:13:35,612 --> 00:13:36,962
And I did it.

220
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,063
Thank you, Jimmy.

221
00:13:39,104 --> 00:13:40,954
My ritual's almost complete.

222
00:13:41,229 --> 00:13:42,580
Madulli curses you !

223
00:13:42,592 --> 00:13:43,895
You !

224
00:13:44,776 --> 00:13:47,754
I'm afraid Madulli's a little late
to the party on that one.

225
00:13:52,334 --> 00:13:54,761
Appreciate your helping me out tonight,
Jimmy.

226
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,279
I've been waiting a long time for this.

227
00:13:59,056 --> 00:14:00,826
I really needed it.

228
00:14:20,549 --> 00:14:21,979
What the fuck ?

229
00:14:40,448 --> 00:14:42,429
Let that be a lesson to you.

230
00:14:42,955 --> 00:14:44,864
<i>I've always enjoyed my work.</i>

231
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:46,742
<i>It brings order to the chaos,</i>

232
00:14:46,777 --> 00:14:48,585
<i>fills me with civic pride.</i>

233
00:14:49,047 --> 00:14:50,922
<i>But what was that back there ?</i>

234
00:14:50,963 --> 00:14:52,498
<i>Not voodoo.</i>

235
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,525
<i>When I picked up the knife,
it's like I didn't know who I was.</i>

236
00:14:56,433 --> 00:14:58,685
<i>I come here to dump bodies,
not beer bottles.</i>

237
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,356
<i>Now, I'm just a little bug.</i>

238
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:33,423
What are doing working out
in the middle of the night ?

239
00:15:33,861 --> 00:15:36,446
- I couldn't sleep.
- Tomorrow's your big day.

240
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:42,275
Where the fuck were you ?
I was worried about you.

241
00:15:42,369 --> 00:15:43,647
Bowling.

242
00:15:43,682 --> 00:15:45,321
Kinda late for bowling.

243
00:15:45,572 --> 00:15:47,815
Kinda not looking for your opinion.

244
00:15:49,091 --> 00:15:51,032
You said you cleaned the place today.

245
00:15:51,415 --> 00:15:53,048
I did. It got messed up again.

246
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,528
I'll suppose you were looking
at apartment rental ads

247
00:15:55,563 --> 00:15:56,737
while you were on the treadmill.

248
00:15:56,772 --> 00:15:59,223
- If you want me out of here, just...
- I don't.

249
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:00,694
I just had a bad...

250
00:16:02,102 --> 00:16:03,741
bowling night.

251
00:16:04,517 --> 00:16:07,137
What I meant was,
whenever you're ready to be on your own,

252
00:16:07,172 --> 00:16:09,176
I'll help you with the transition,
that's all.

253
00:16:10,464 --> 00:16:11,840
Thanks, Dex.

254
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:14,196
Thanks for putting up with me.

255
00:16:15,629 --> 00:16:17,058
You're all I got.

256
00:16:19,095 --> 00:16:21,286
It's not such
a great bargain for you, huh ?

257
00:16:23,318 --> 00:16:24,852
I'm not complaining.

258
00:16:26,984 --> 00:16:28,287
Night.

259
00:16:28,701 --> 00:16:30,372
It's your turn on the couch.

260
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:32,125
Could you at least pick up your...

261
00:16:33,597 --> 00:16:36,313
<i>Debra can't sleep
in an empty house anymore.</i>

262
00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:38,794
<i>In fact, she can't sleep much at all.</i>

263
00:16:38,836 --> 00:16:40,822
<i>I guess that's what happens
when your fiancé</i>

264
00:16:40,857 --> 00:16:43,731
<i>tries to slice you up
into small bloodless pieces.</i>

265
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:49,273
Pathetic.

266
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:00,700
Did you see that ?

267
00:17:00,735 --> 00:17:02,388
Nice shooting, Dex.
We need to talk.

268
00:17:02,423 --> 00:17:03,846
Those boars won't stand a chance.

269
00:17:03,881 --> 00:17:05,781
- Hope one charges me.
- No, you don't.

270
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:08,331
- That thing got massive stopping power.
- Slow down.

271
00:17:08,366 --> 00:17:09,496
I got bad news.

272
00:17:09,531 --> 00:17:11,433
They need me to take a shift at work.

273
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:13,619
Right now ?

274
00:17:13,654 --> 00:17:16,186
- What about the boar hunt ?
- We'll plan another trip.

275
00:17:16,221 --> 00:17:17,767
I waited two weeks for this trip.

276
00:17:17,802 --> 00:17:19,820
- You can wait another one.
- No, I can't !

277
00:17:19,855 --> 00:17:20,906
If you read the books,

278
00:17:20,941 --> 00:17:24,142
you know that psychopaths like me
have a low tolerance for frustration.

279
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:25,198
Dexter, enough...

280
00:17:25,233 --> 00:17:26,528
with the psychopath bullshit.

281
00:17:26,563 --> 00:17:29,250
You're in control of your urges,
not the other way around.

282
00:17:29,285 --> 00:17:31,337
You don't understand, dad, I need this.

283
00:17:31,481 --> 00:17:33,153
It's not just a sport to me.

284
00:17:33,188 --> 00:17:36,336
I'm sorry, son,
I have responsibilities at work.

285
00:17:36,371 --> 00:17:37,702
Now, come on.

286
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:40,209
I'll drop you off at home.
Give me the gun.

287
00:17:54,619 --> 00:17:56,705
There's cheese in that donut ?

288
00:17:56,982 --> 00:17:58,726
Oh, that's a Danish.

289
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:02,061
Look,
they forgot the frosting on this one.

290
00:18:02,443 --> 00:18:05,579
Some people like donuts,
plain, no frosting.

291
00:18:07,693 --> 00:18:10,383
<i>I can't even get donuts right.
What's going on here ?</i>

292
00:18:12,183 --> 00:18:13,448
Sorry guys, I was in a hurry,

293
00:18:13,483 --> 00:18:17,171
I just ordered a dozen pastry-buffs,
like you two deserve better than this.

294
00:18:17,895 --> 00:18:19,508
Thanks, Dexter.

295
00:18:20,645 --> 00:18:23,755
We're gonna go visit my dad
in jail today. Wanna come ?

296
00:18:24,742 --> 00:18:26,381
Afraid I gotta work, buddy.

297
00:18:29,179 --> 00:18:30,985
Thanks for getting here so fast.

298
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,310
What's the emergency ?

299
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:33,601
Hip-Hop Harry is on.

300
00:18:46,617 --> 00:18:48,650
We're good for fifteen minutes.

301
00:18:53,443 --> 00:18:55,713
I know we're supposed
to have dinner tonight,

302
00:18:55,748 --> 00:18:57,446
but I just had this urge.

303
00:19:00,454 --> 00:19:02,435
I'm all for satisfying urges.

304
00:19:02,844 --> 00:19:05,909
<i>I just wish I knew why
I couldn't satisfy mine, last night.</i>

305
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:26,046
- Is everything okay ?
- It will be. Just keep going.

306
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:31,534
<i>Any minute, now...</i>

307
00:19:43,186 --> 00:19:44,563
Sorry.

308
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:49,226
No, it's my fault,
I shouldn't be springing this on you.

309
00:19:51,184 --> 00:19:53,322
No, I'm just feeling...

310
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,895
a little pressure at work.

311
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:04,090
<i>I'll be okay.</i>

312
00:20:04,157 --> 00:20:06,821
<i>I follow the code.
The stalk was good.</i>

313
00:20:07,377 --> 00:20:10,066
<i>I'm just a little rusty
since killing my brother.</i>

314
00:20:11,736 --> 00:20:14,123
<i>Or maybe I took pity on my victim.</i>

315
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:18,659
<i>I mean, sure, he's a heinous killer,
but he also bumps into walls.</i>

316
00:20:24,527 --> 00:20:26,245
Hey, Sergeant.

317
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:28,801
Thank for supporting the bowling team.

318
00:20:28,836 --> 00:20:29,730
Fuck you !

319
00:20:29,765 --> 00:20:32,271
Where's my blood report
on the Maynard victim ?

320
00:20:36,025 --> 00:20:37,743
So what's that ?
A titty site ?

321
00:20:40,148 --> 00:20:41,813
- Caught me.
- Bullshit.

322
00:20:42,038 --> 00:20:44,229
What the hell
were you really doing in here ?

323
00:20:44,638 --> 00:20:46,224
The tits are right there.

324
00:20:47,736 --> 00:20:50,530
But in ten years,
you've never rented a single porn title.

325
00:20:54,092 --> 00:20:55,653
How would you know ?

326
00:20:58,136 --> 00:21:01,709
Call me an office crazy, but your
humbling interest in my personal life

327
00:21:01,744 --> 00:21:04,482
could be misinterpreted
as harassment in some circles.

328
00:21:05,495 --> 00:21:07,055
So, report me.

329
00:21:07,758 --> 00:21:09,922
<i>I could think of easier solutions.</i>

330
00:21:11,591 --> 00:21:13,073
Nice tits.

331
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,997
- James, you got any misdemeanor A-form ?
- Filed in the filing cabinet.

332
00:21:27,479 --> 00:21:31,886
Can anybody tell me where the goddamn
misdemeanor A-forms are kept ?

333
00:21:32,564 --> 00:21:34,492
I've got some right here, Lieutenant.

334
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:37,530
OK, alright, move along.

335
00:21:37,565 --> 00:21:40,307
Nothing to see here,
just another fucking day at work.

336
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:48,973
Welcome back, Morgan.

337
00:21:49,742 --> 00:21:51,310
Thanks.

338
00:21:54,327 --> 00:21:55,651
Maria.

339
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,709
A tour boat guide called in
a body down at the Breakwater.

340
00:22:06,744 --> 00:22:09,898
I want you to take Doakes
and a support team. And take Morgan.

341
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:12,271
I want to get her back out
on the field today.

342
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,227
She's not ready.
Shouldn't even be here.

343
00:22:16,262 --> 00:22:17,871
What's it been, five weeks, six ?

344
00:22:17,906 --> 00:22:21,289
Appreciate your concern,
but according to her psych evaluation,

345
00:22:21,324 --> 00:22:23,580
she's ready
to get back out onto the field.

346
00:22:24,782 --> 00:22:27,813
You just gotta look her in the eyes
to know she's not right.

347
00:22:27,932 --> 00:22:31,173
You put her onto the field,
she could melt down, freak out.

348
00:22:32,689 --> 00:22:34,446
She hugged me.

349
00:22:35,304 --> 00:22:38,467
Alright, you partner with her today
so you can keep an eye on her.

350
00:22:38,508 --> 00:22:40,278
- That's...
- not a request.

351
00:22:40,313 --> 00:22:42,009
Put Doakes with Batista.

352
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:48,055
Fine.

353
00:22:51,274 --> 00:22:52,570
I know that it's difficult

354
00:22:52,605 --> 00:22:55,681
for you to take orders when you feel
that you should be giving them.

355
00:22:55,716 --> 00:22:58,108
And I really appreciate
your professionalism.

356
00:22:59,131 --> 00:23:00,933
Thanks. Thank you.

357
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:05,842
You don't like roses ?

358
00:23:05,877 --> 00:23:07,180
Allergies.

359
00:23:07,994 --> 00:23:10,424
Let me know what you find out
about that body.

360
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:14,867
Okay, guys, listen up.

361
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:23,995
Heard your sister's
back on the job already.

362
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,453
Is she in any kind of shape ?

363
00:23:25,661 --> 00:23:27,714
Well, you know Deb,
nothing gets her down.

364
00:23:27,749 --> 00:23:30,410
No, I mean, did she pack
on any pounds while she was gone,

365
00:23:30,445 --> 00:23:32,322
cause last time I saw her,
she was tight.

366
00:23:34,944 --> 00:23:38,107
We got multiple chop wounds,
pretty much head to toe.

367
00:23:39,275 --> 00:23:41,413
Alright, you call it.
Heads or tails ?

368
00:23:42,033 --> 00:23:44,434
- Heads.
- Hey, I didn't flip yet.

369
00:23:44,688 --> 00:23:48,428
- You said "call it".
- Damn, I always get the ass end.

370
00:23:48,805 --> 00:23:52,072
- Here you go, Sergeant.
- Nevermind.

371
00:23:55,387 --> 00:23:57,657
I got sharp force trauma here.

372
00:23:58,047 --> 00:23:59,896
Heavy impact, parallel wounds.

373
00:24:00,095 --> 00:24:01,407
Maybe an axe.

374
00:24:01,442 --> 00:24:04,631
No, the defense wounds on the forearms
are long and linear.

375
00:24:04,682 --> 00:24:08,280
I can make out bevelled margins.
A machete did this.

376
00:24:08,331 --> 00:24:11,540
The machetes are weapons of choice
of the 29th St. Kings.

377
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:14,327
The victim was in the gang
judging from that tattoo.

378
00:24:14,362 --> 00:24:17,080
We think the body was carried
from a nearby location.

379
00:24:17,201 --> 00:24:20,572
I found a real good blood trail
coming down from the road.

380
00:24:23,764 --> 00:24:25,114
Lens.

381
00:24:28,081 --> 00:24:30,887
Just make sure we check the dock's lifts
for criminal records.

382
00:24:30,922 --> 00:24:34,452
It's possible this victim was killed
by one of these boat owners out here.

383
00:24:34,489 --> 00:24:38,090
Or maybe it was just an easy-access spot
to dump a corpse at night.

384
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:41,692
No light poles, and the freeway
exit ramp is just a block away.

385
00:24:42,027 --> 00:24:43,535
He's got a point.

386
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:47,401
Yo, Dex.

387
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:53,703
You're supposed to preserve
the crime scene, asshole.

388
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,815
What's the matter with you today ?

389
00:25:00,153 --> 00:25:02,816
Just a little off my game.
I'll get it back.

390
00:25:05,021 --> 00:25:07,235
- What time did you find the body ?
- Seven o'clock.

391
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:10,108
I start prepping the Banana Boat
every morning at seven o'clock

392
00:25:10,143 --> 00:25:12,646
- for Miami Banana Tour.
- Banana Tour ?

393
00:25:13,186 --> 00:25:16,296
It's a Calypso journey
through Miami's inner harbor.

394
00:25:16,331 --> 00:25:18,493
- And you should try it.
- I'll think about it.

395
00:25:19,168 --> 00:25:21,092
Ain't that the Ice Truck Killer's babe ?

396
00:25:21,127 --> 00:25:23,017
She was in the paper.
She's fucking hot !

397
00:25:23,441 --> 00:25:26,341
- Did you see anyone else out here ?
- No, not this morning.

398
00:25:29,031 --> 00:25:32,174
- Are you sure ?
- Yeah, I'd have given him a brochure.

399
00:25:32,209 --> 00:25:33,699
Hey, Mrs. Ice Truck Killer !

400
00:25:34,262 --> 00:25:36,047
Oh, God. Hang on, hang on.

401
00:25:36,082 --> 00:25:38,683
Just turn around,
look scared for the camera.

402
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:42,318
Well, if you think of anything else,
you have our numbers.

403
00:25:42,353 --> 00:25:44,803
And you have mine.
Can I pass these on now ?

404
00:25:44,838 --> 00:25:46,465
- Knock yourself out.
- Thank you.

405
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,427
Just look over here,
look scared for the camera.

406
00:25:58,666 --> 00:26:00,122
Thank you.

407
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:04,232
What, you need help with something ?

408
00:26:07,737 --> 00:26:09,209
Rafael !

409
00:26:09,626 --> 00:26:11,659
- Where is Rafael ?
- Sergeant !

410
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,502
Grab her !

411
00:26:16,453 --> 00:26:18,083
Somebody stop her !

412
00:26:23,299 --> 00:26:25,668
Goddamnit, Morgan, grab her !

413
00:26:51,872 --> 00:26:54,745
Can we please secure
this motherfucking crime scene ?

414
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,371
What did she say ?

415
00:27:05,577 --> 00:27:07,138
That's her son.

416
00:27:07,717 --> 00:27:09,566
She says she knows who killed him.

417
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:11,910
Some guy named Little Chino.

418
00:27:13,933 --> 00:27:16,570
- Felt like she was asking me something.
- She was.

419
00:27:17,215 --> 00:27:20,377
She wants you to find Little Chino
and kill him like a dog.

420
00:27:32,453 --> 00:27:33,961
<i>That look...</i>

421
00:27:35,177 --> 00:27:36,658
<i>I know that look.</i>

422
00:27:37,648 --> 00:27:40,522
<i>Like her mother, she wants
someone to do something.</i>

423
00:27:47,537 --> 00:27:51,255
And next stop on Matchie the matchbook's
magical journey

424
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:53,630
down the rainbow path is...

425
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:56,985
the dreaded chocolate swamp.

426
00:27:57,569 --> 00:28:00,547
Why is it dreaded ?
I love chocolate.

427
00:28:00,868 --> 00:28:03,816
Because the chocolate swamp...

428
00:28:03,851 --> 00:28:07,191
is the home of a goopey gooey
nightmare named Glappy

429
00:28:07,226 --> 00:28:10,531
who turns children to Fudgsicles
and eats them...

430
00:28:12,102 --> 00:28:13,794
What does Matchie do ?

431
00:28:16,648 --> 00:28:20,782
Well, luckily, Glappy was sleeping,
so Matchie

432
00:28:20,902 --> 00:28:24,589
goes straight to Candy Castle
where he becomes King Candy,

433
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:27,033
who can turn everyone into sweets

434
00:28:27,068 --> 00:28:30,023
with a wave of his royal gum ball staff.

435
00:28:30,058 --> 00:28:31,407
Cool story, dad.

436
00:28:31,442 --> 00:28:34,391
But next time,
can we play the actual game ?

437
00:28:35,251 --> 00:28:37,147
First chance I get,
I'll talk to the warden

438
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:39,822
about finding some
of those missing game pieces, okay ?

439
00:28:43,357 --> 00:28:45,048
Gotta go, kids.

440
00:28:47,044 --> 00:28:49,130
Alright, say goodbye to your father.

441
00:28:49,191 --> 00:28:50,943
Jump, jump !

442
00:28:55,439 --> 00:28:57,236
What's wrong with your lip ?

443
00:28:58,214 --> 00:29:01,009
Well, I was biting it,
cause I was excited to see you.

444
00:29:01,421 --> 00:29:03,322
So come back real soon, okay ?

445
00:29:07,381 --> 00:29:09,030
Rita, one minute ?

446
00:29:10,662 --> 00:29:12,432
Go wait by the door.

447
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,916
I need your help, my lawyer's
gonna file my appeal tomorrow.

448
00:29:17,951 --> 00:29:19,729
But I don't stand a chance
without that shoe.

449
00:29:19,764 --> 00:29:22,418
There's no shoe.
How many times I have to tell you that ?

450
00:29:24,553 --> 00:29:27,715
Anything, any evidence to support
the fact that I was set up.

451
00:29:27,853 --> 00:29:30,595
- You mean that Dexter set you up.
- Somebody set me up.

452
00:29:32,894 --> 00:29:35,662
Rita, I'm not doing
real good in here, okay ?

453
00:29:35,967 --> 00:29:37,554
It's a federal prison.

454
00:29:37,803 --> 00:29:39,967
Hardcore. I don't belong here.

455
00:29:40,732 --> 00:29:42,240
Will you help me ?

456
00:29:44,459 --> 00:29:46,807
I need to go.
See you in a couple of weeks.

457
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,978
Will you please take Eva's statement ?

458
00:30:01,659 --> 00:30:03,874
Set up her daughter Marissa
with some crayons.

459
00:30:04,612 --> 00:30:05,962
Sure thing.

460
00:30:19,579 --> 00:30:22,914
<i>That girl's gonna need more than crayons
to make her world right.</i>

461
00:30:25,461 --> 00:30:28,201
<i>Killing Little Chino
could restore my world too,</i>

462
00:30:28,518 --> 00:30:30,786
<i>but only if he satisfies Harry's code.</i>

463
00:30:34,171 --> 00:30:35,849
I see you've been benched ?

464
00:30:36,341 --> 00:30:39,690
LaGuerta is just jealous the Ice Truck
Killer fucked me instead of her.

465
00:30:42,569 --> 00:30:43,698
You chipper.

466
00:30:43,733 --> 00:30:45,654
I'm just happy to be back on the job.

467
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,490
What do you want ?

468
00:30:49,539 --> 00:30:52,367
I'm just working on my blood report
from the crime scene today,

469
00:30:52,402 --> 00:30:54,321
I wondered what you found
on the suspect.

470
00:30:54,928 --> 00:30:56,861
Cocksucker's guilty as they come.

471
00:30:57,166 --> 00:31:01,344
He's an inforcer for the 29th St. Kings,
East Side gang, intensely violent.

472
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:04,455
He's been linked to 9 murders
in the last five years.

473
00:31:04,873 --> 00:31:06,234
<i>So far, so good.</i>

474
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:08,282
<i>I just hope he's not blind.</i>

475
00:31:08,317 --> 00:31:10,624
- Has he ever been tried ?
- Twice.

476
00:31:10,863 --> 00:31:13,218
But the witnesses in each case
were murdered.

477
00:31:13,253 --> 00:31:14,505
We think by Chino himself.

478
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,817
Now, people
are just too afraid to come forward.

479
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,910
Come on, Chino ! Right this way.

480
00:31:36,342 --> 00:31:38,624
Fucking beef bus !

481
00:31:47,166 --> 00:31:48,575
Dad !

482
00:31:50,035 --> 00:31:51,323
I'm okay, Dex.

483
00:31:51,358 --> 00:31:52,566
I've told you

484
00:31:52,601 --> 00:31:55,944
never put your finger on the trigger
unless you're shooting !

485
00:31:55,991 --> 00:31:58,317
- Are you okay ?
- Jesus ! That was close !

486
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:00,476
My heart's beating out of my chest !

487
00:32:02,241 --> 00:32:03,563
Let me feel !

488
00:32:03,736 --> 00:32:05,296
- Feel what ?
- Your heart !

489
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,266
That's amazing !

490
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:17,530
<i>A challenge.</i>

491
00:32:17,879 --> 00:32:19,414
<i>A mountain to climb.</i>

492
00:32:19,876 --> 00:32:21,176
<i>I need this one.</i>

493
00:32:21,834 --> 00:32:24,224
<i>Little Chino came to me front door.</i>

494
00:32:25,602 --> 00:32:27,561
<i>He ask for me son Rafael.</i>

495
00:32:28,185 --> 00:32:31,931
<i>Rafael did not want
to go with Little Chino.</i>

496
00:32:32,609 --> 00:32:34,381
But he was afraid not to.

497
00:32:35,335 --> 00:32:36,650
<i>What was he going to do ?</i>

498
00:32:36,685 --> 00:32:39,551
<i>My brother was living in Georgia.</i>

499
00:32:39,955 --> 00:32:42,204
<i>Rafael was going to leave me with him.</i>

500
00:32:42,662 --> 00:32:44,737
<i>That's why he kill him...</i>

501
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:46,821
<i>I know...</i>

502
00:32:49,689 --> 00:32:51,267
<i>Eva !</i>

503
00:32:53,914 --> 00:32:55,878
Are you willing to testify

504
00:32:56,523 --> 00:32:59,524
that Little Chino picked up your son
on the night of his death ?

505
00:33:01,481 --> 00:33:03,396
Come on, don't back down now.

506
00:33:08,323 --> 00:33:10,006
<i>I want him to pay.</i>

507
00:33:12,022 --> 00:33:13,322
Got him !

508
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,737
<i>Oh, that's discouraging...</i>

509
00:33:16,517 --> 00:33:18,228
<i>With a grieving mother as a witness,</i>

510
00:33:18,263 --> 00:33:20,791
<i>Little Chino will never reach
my cutting courtroom.</i>

511
00:33:27,326 --> 00:33:28,626
Hey, Morgan.

512
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:30,239
You wanna see something swell ?

513
00:33:30,257 --> 00:33:31,589
Come a little closer.

514
00:33:32,128 --> 00:33:34,928
And the token has spoken.
Good to see you too, Vince.

515
00:33:35,558 --> 00:33:38,038
I heard we captured Big Foot ?

516
00:33:38,278 --> 00:33:41,328
Behold ! The 8th wonder of the world.

517
00:33:41,896 --> 00:33:43,468
<i>Am I speaking clearly ?</i>

518
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,714
Then, answer my fucking question, Chino !

519
00:33:53,935 --> 00:33:56,357
What time did you pick up Rafael,
last night ?

520
00:33:57,601 --> 00:33:58,923
Last night ?

521
00:33:59,154 --> 00:34:01,094
I didn't see Rafael last night.

522
00:34:02,659 --> 00:34:05,424
OK. So, why would Rafael's mother
make up that story, Chino ?

523
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:09,890
That puta's into the devil's candy, man.
Fucking heroin.

524
00:34:09,925 --> 00:34:11,106
Shit.

525
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:13,402
She was probably high.

526
00:34:13,498 --> 00:34:15,717
<i>You're telling me that
Eva Raines is a junkie ?</i>

527
00:34:16,671 --> 00:34:20,086
If that's true, Pasquale and LaGuerta
are gonna have a piss party.

528
00:34:22,931 --> 00:34:25,487
Eva Ranez, two pops for
drug possession.

529
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:28,044
No fucking way the D.A.
puts a drug user on the stand.

530
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:29,510
That chulo's gonna walk again.

531
00:34:30,904 --> 00:34:32,504
<i>But not very far.</i>

532
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:40,293
<i>We'll both be vindicated soon.</i>

533
00:35:13,372 --> 00:35:15,504
<i>OK boys, today's our day.</i>

534
00:35:15,764 --> 00:35:18,662
<i>If we find that galley,
it'll bring back gold !</i>

535
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,455
<i>There's an aberration on the sea floor.</i>

536
00:35:24,629 --> 00:35:26,784
<i>The crevice's at 65 feet.</i>

537
00:35:27,023 --> 00:35:29,652
<i>It has to be
where the Santa Rosa went down.</i>

538
00:35:43,403 --> 00:35:46,058
<i>The crevice's 30 to 40 yards
straight ahead.</i>

539
00:36:12,147 --> 00:36:16,587
<i>Crevice should be 25 yards ahead.
Baring 1-1-4.</i>

540
00:36:59,733 --> 00:37:01,004
I need your help.

541
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:03,882
I know how much you were
looking forward to going out, tonight,

542
00:37:03,917 --> 00:37:05,604
but I think Deb could use you more.

543
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:08,359
Dexter, this isn't about
this morning, is it ?

544
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:11,404
No ! I swear. This is for Deb.

545
00:37:11,439 --> 00:37:14,865
She had her first day at work, today,
and LaGuerta was kind of rough on her.

546
00:37:15,336 --> 00:37:17,373
- Dexter, unlock the door !
- Hold on.

547
00:37:17,767 --> 00:37:18,928
Hold on !

548
00:37:18,963 --> 00:37:20,440
Dexter, come on !

549
00:37:21,644 --> 00:37:23,314
Open the fucking door !

550
00:37:23,969 --> 00:37:25,793
See, she's yelling at me, now.

551
00:37:25,975 --> 00:37:29,478
Look, I'm no expert, but I think Deb
could use some girl time tonight.

552
00:37:30,625 --> 00:37:31,824
I won't lie...

553
00:37:31,859 --> 00:37:35,154
I'm a little disappointed, but I know
your heart's in the right place.

554
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,680
Absolutely.

555
00:37:37,685 --> 00:37:39,914
OK, whatever you need, Dexter.

556
00:37:40,015 --> 00:37:42,133
Thank you, Rita.
I will make this up to you.

557
00:37:42,311 --> 00:37:45,138
I'm gonna have Deb
pick you up in a half hour, okay ? Bye.

558
00:37:48,848 --> 00:37:50,148
Sorry.

559
00:37:50,565 --> 00:37:53,908
I double booked when I made plans
to go out with Rita tonight.

560
00:37:53,943 --> 00:37:57,251
I forgot that I had promised
to sub for another bowling team.

561
00:37:57,842 --> 00:37:59,436
Why are you so happy about it ?

562
00:37:59,632 --> 00:38:02,841
I like bowling, what can I say ?
Look, will you take Rita out for me ?

563
00:38:02,876 --> 00:38:06,050
- She hired a babysitter and everything.
- No way, I need to work out.

564
00:38:06,085 --> 00:38:09,196
Actually, you need to stop working out.
It's getting unhealthy.

565
00:38:09,231 --> 00:38:11,390
You should go out
for some hard liquor instead.

566
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:14,298
- Sorry, bro.
- Deb, please !

567
00:38:16,369 --> 00:38:18,251
When do I ever ask you for anything ?

568
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,201
You bung hole.
Why did you have to put it that way ?

569
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:27,945
She's expecting you in half an hour.
You're a life saver !

570
00:38:35,934 --> 00:38:37,334
<i>Tonight's the night.</i>

571
00:38:38,596 --> 00:38:39,896
<i>Really.</i>

572
00:38:41,827 --> 00:38:45,754
<i>Harry would prefer I take more time,
but my life is falling apart.</i>

573
00:38:48,657 --> 00:38:51,503
<i>Whatever stopped my knife before
won't stop it again.</i>

574
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:53,063
Hey, there !

575
00:38:54,811 --> 00:38:56,732
I'm gonna work on my release, tonight.

576
00:38:57,165 --> 00:38:59,202
Practise, practise, practise !

577
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,770
Lane's open till midnight.
You wanna join me ?

578
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:13,960
Fuck it !

579
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,068
There's nothing else to talk about !
You are a liar !

580
00:39:53,103 --> 00:39:55,058
- You lie !
- Would you stop ?

581
00:39:55,093 --> 00:39:56,923
You gonna act a lot better !

582
00:39:56,958 --> 00:40:00,308
If you want me to act better,
then you treat me better !

583
00:40:00,343 --> 00:40:02,850
You got these things
all mixed up in your head !

584
00:40:02,885 --> 00:40:04,601
Listen to me, I love you.

585
00:40:04,636 --> 00:40:06,318
Alright ? It's all about you !

586
00:40:06,353 --> 00:40:07,554
There is nobody else !

587
00:40:07,589 --> 00:40:11,069
Is that why you sent me
three dozen fucking roses ?

588
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,023
- Get out of my sight !
- There's noboby else !

589
00:40:14,058 --> 00:40:16,144
I sent you flowers, baby,
because I love you.

590
00:40:16,179 --> 00:40:18,323
Get out of my sight !
I've got nothing else

591
00:40:18,358 --> 00:40:20,468
to say to you,
until you decide to man up !

592
00:40:21,268 --> 00:40:22,568
Please, go.

593
00:40:33,217 --> 00:40:34,517
Maria ?

594
00:40:34,625 --> 00:40:35,925
Fuck !

595
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:46,507
I'm sorry you had to hear that.

596
00:40:47,337 --> 00:40:49,046
That was my fiancé.

597
00:40:49,961 --> 00:40:52,431
We are having some problems.

598
00:40:54,176 --> 00:40:55,749
Well, that happens.

599
00:41:05,115 --> 00:41:07,317
I called his house 3 nights in a row
and he says

600
00:41:07,352 --> 00:41:09,519
he's working.
He didn't return my phone calls.

601
00:41:09,962 --> 00:41:12,143
And then he comes home
and he says he's tired.

602
00:41:14,229 --> 00:41:17,249
He is tired because he's out there
fucking some bitch.

603
00:41:17,953 --> 00:41:19,584
I can smell it on him.

604
00:41:22,409 --> 00:41:24,310
Don't worry about washing their hair.

605
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:27,734
- And read to them before bed.
- Okay, got it.

606
00:41:29,843 --> 00:41:31,660
<i>You've a collect call from Paul Bennett.</i>

607
00:41:31,695 --> 00:41:34,657
<i>- Will you take the charges ?
- Yes, I'll accept the charges.</i>

608
00:41:37,348 --> 00:41:38,648
Excuse me.

609
00:41:39,384 --> 00:41:42,038
<i>Rita, do you have a second ?
I need to talk to you.</i>

610
00:41:42,073 --> 00:41:43,251
What do you want ?

611
00:41:43,687 --> 00:41:45,357
I'm not gonna make it, in here.

612
00:41:45,551 --> 00:41:48,038
I don't have time for your bullshit
right now, Paul.

613
00:41:48,073 --> 00:41:49,613
<i>It's not bullshit !</i>

614
00:41:49,648 --> 00:41:52,657
I'm not like these guys,
I don't belong here, Rita.

615
00:41:52,692 --> 00:41:54,151
Can you help me ?

616
00:41:54,186 --> 00:41:55,610
Help you ? What ?

617
00:41:56,593 --> 00:41:59,153
Just... Can you look
for the shoe one more time ?

618
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:03,366
I found the fucking shoe, okay ?

619
00:42:04,012 --> 00:42:06,086
You what ?

620
00:42:06,288 --> 00:42:08,816
That's great !
I'll call the lawyer in the morning !

621
00:42:08,851 --> 00:42:10,034
Look, why does it matter ?

622
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:12,443
It's just a shoe,
it doesn't mean anything.

623
00:42:12,606 --> 00:42:15,346
You were probably high on smack
when you lost it at my house.

624
00:42:15,381 --> 00:42:17,835
Whatever, I'll let the court
fucking decide that !

625
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:19,147
<i>It's a good news !</i>

626
00:42:20,255 --> 00:42:22,990
If you send a lawyer to my house,
the shoe won't be here.

627
00:42:23,025 --> 00:42:25,498
<i>I'm not gonna let you drag
Dexter into this !</i>

628
00:42:25,526 --> 00:42:27,063
I'm in a healthy relationship.

629
00:42:27,098 --> 00:42:30,910
Finally ! And I'm not gonna throw it away
to bail out my abusive ex-husband !

630
00:42:30,945 --> 00:42:32,222
<i>It doesn't work that way.</i>

631
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:34,105
Look, I gotta go !

632
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:37,585
No, you don't !
Rita, don't hang up that fucking phone !

633
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:39,902
Stop blaming other people
for your problems !

634
00:42:39,937 --> 00:42:42,184
You're in prison, now, Paul.
Deal with it.

635
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:58,618
<i>Some gangs earn teardrops
of blood by killing.</i>

636
00:42:59,184 --> 00:43:01,208
<i>I understand.
We all need our keepsakes.</i>

637
00:43:01,243 --> 00:43:04,241
<i>One man's tattoos
are another man's blood slides.</i>

638
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:08,696
<i>All I had to do was call the gang
task force, ask where the 29th St. Kings</i>

639
00:43:08,731 --> 00:43:11,708
<i>get their tattoes,
and wait for my prey to show up.</i>

640
00:43:19,403 --> 00:43:20,707
What the fuck ?

641
00:43:22,374 --> 00:43:24,893
What the fuck ! Get the fuck off me !

642
00:43:25,052 --> 00:43:26,819
Fuck ! Get the fuck off !

643
00:43:28,409 --> 00:43:29,751
Fuck that shit !

644
00:43:45,062 --> 00:43:47,137
<i>The scene of the failed crime.</i>

645
00:43:47,145 --> 00:43:49,008
<i>No better place to try again.</i>

646
00:43:49,094 --> 00:43:51,690
<i>I have it on good authority
the owner fled town.</i>

647
00:43:52,354 --> 00:43:55,664
<i>Plus it's a much quieter working
environment now without the chickens.</i>

648
00:44:13,714 --> 00:44:15,014
So...

649
00:44:16,222 --> 00:44:17,872
You and Dexter come here a lot ?

650
00:44:18,633 --> 00:44:20,149
We love the Hot Wings.

651
00:44:24,571 --> 00:44:27,534
Look, I'm sorry
if I'm such bad company tonight.

652
00:44:27,569 --> 00:44:29,221
Paul called right before we left.

653
00:44:29,877 --> 00:44:31,257
Yeah ? What did he want ?

654
00:44:32,037 --> 00:44:33,237
Who knows ?

655
00:44:33,272 --> 00:44:35,675
Make me feel bad he's in prison,
I suppose.

656
00:44:36,251 --> 00:44:39,755
I'm the one that answered that domestic
dispute call way back when, remember ?

657
00:44:40,097 --> 00:44:42,076
That prick deserves to be in prison.

658
00:44:42,393 --> 00:44:44,024
I know, I know.

659
00:44:44,399 --> 00:44:45,699
I'm just...

660
00:44:46,076 --> 00:44:48,363
I can't believe
I still let him get to me

661
00:44:48,398 --> 00:44:50,068
after everything he's put me through.

662
00:44:53,964 --> 00:44:56,579
Oh God... I'm such an idiot.

663
00:44:56,818 --> 00:45:00,076
What you went through
is so much worse than my problems.

664
00:45:00,329 --> 00:45:01,629
What ?

665
00:45:02,103 --> 00:45:04,666
My psycho killer fiancé ? Please.

666
00:45:05,111 --> 00:45:06,411
I've had worse.

667
00:45:06,673 --> 00:45:08,468
At least, he paid for my meals.

668
00:45:09,982 --> 00:45:12,366
I can't believe you moved on like that.

669
00:45:12,587 --> 00:45:14,276
I wish I could be more like you.

670
00:45:14,802 --> 00:45:16,456
I mean Paul was...

671
00:45:16,491 --> 00:45:18,111
so horrible to me.

672
00:45:19,162 --> 00:45:20,716
Really horrible.

673
00:45:21,361 --> 00:45:22,665
Sometimes...

674
00:45:23,242 --> 00:45:25,211
And don't tell Dexter, but...

675
00:45:25,952 --> 00:45:27,252
Sometimes,

676
00:45:27,708 --> 00:45:30,207
I find myself missing
the good parts of him.

677
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:34,413
God...

678
00:45:37,797 --> 00:45:39,097
Not him.

679
00:45:40,865 --> 00:45:42,921
Not him. It's not him that you miss.

680
00:45:45,274 --> 00:45:47,541
Because what he had to offer
wasn't real.

681
00:45:51,254 --> 00:45:53,521
The way he made you feel
about yourself...

682
00:45:57,485 --> 00:45:58,785
That was real.

683
00:46:01,353 --> 00:46:02,653
Hey, are you okay ?

684
00:46:03,523 --> 00:46:04,823
Need a refill ?

685
00:46:10,281 --> 00:46:12,308
Can I get another draught, please ?

686
00:46:13,223 --> 00:46:14,739
Excuse me ?

687
00:46:14,902 --> 00:46:16,803
Don't I know you from somewhere ?

688
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,840
Haven't I seen you on television ?

689
00:46:27,123 --> 00:46:28,532
Are you that girlfriend...

690
00:46:28,567 --> 00:46:29,941
What the fuck are you doing ?

691
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:32,169
- Debra, what happened ?
- He grabbed me !

692
00:46:32,204 --> 00:46:33,925
You saw him, right ?

693
00:46:34,068 --> 00:46:35,882
- He grabbed me.
- I think you broke

694
00:46:35,917 --> 00:46:37,696
- my nose !
- He fucking grabbed me !

695
00:46:37,731 --> 00:46:39,320
All I did was touch you !

696
00:46:39,355 --> 00:46:40,909
You saw it ! He grabbed me !

697
00:46:50,596 --> 00:46:53,269
<i>He wasn't easy to get here,
but here he is.</i>

698
00:46:53,567 --> 00:46:55,044
<i>And here I am.</i>

699
00:46:55,365 --> 00:46:57,362
<i>Ready. Willing.</i>

700
00:47:00,072 --> 00:47:01,433
<i>Able.</i>

701
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,037
Shit !

702
00:47:14,193 --> 00:47:16,277
There's not enough tape !
Perfect !

703
00:47:39,188 --> 00:47:43,380
<i>39 days, 22 hours and 18 minutes
since I killed my brother.</i>

704
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:46,294
<i>I am cursed.</i>

705
00:48:17,283 --> 00:48:19,261
What the hell do you think you're doing ?

706
00:48:20,034 --> 00:48:21,866
- What were you doing ?
- I don't know.

707
00:48:21,901 --> 00:48:23,497
- What were you thinking ?
- I don't know !

708
00:48:23,532 --> 00:48:26,488
Whatever you're going through,
killing yourself is not the answer !

709
00:48:26,523 --> 00:48:28,078
You don't get points for dying !

710
00:48:28,588 --> 00:48:29,888
Dying ?

711
00:48:30,103 --> 00:48:31,908
Dad, I don't wanna die !

712
00:48:32,495 --> 00:48:34,975
I'm just trying to figure out
some way to feel alive !

713
00:48:40,195 --> 00:48:43,698
<i>I don't normally seek human contact
in times of failure.</i>

714
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:46,862
<i>But then, I don't normally
experience failure.</i>

715
00:48:49,379 --> 00:48:52,715
<i>Right now, all I can think about
is the smell of Rita's kitchen.</i>

716
00:48:53,862 --> 00:48:56,496
<i>The breathy cadence
of her sleeping children.</i>

717
00:48:58,029 --> 00:48:59,817
<i>The warmth of her flesh.</i>

718
00:49:25,147 --> 00:49:26,527
What's wrong ?

719
00:49:28,484 --> 00:49:30,057
The prison called.

720
00:49:30,664 --> 00:49:31,964
Paul's dead.

721
00:49:42,591 --> 00:49:45,800
He died in an inmate altercation.

722
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:48,752
It's a fight.

723
00:49:49,054 --> 00:49:51,707
He was angry, and he got into a fight.

724
00:49:53,722 --> 00:49:57,263
Now, I have to figure out how to tell
my children their father's dead.

725
00:50:02,338 --> 00:50:03,795
And I could have helped him.

726
00:50:07,334 --> 00:50:08,634
How ?

727
00:50:11,912 --> 00:50:14,508
How could you have helped him ?
He was in prison.

728
00:50:17,256 --> 00:50:18,559
That's right, Dexter.

729
00:50:19,147 --> 00:50:20,681
It happened in prison.

730
00:50:21,283 --> 00:50:23,261
Paul was in prison.

731
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:28,085
That was his own fault.

732
00:50:33,235 --> 00:50:34,535
Was it ?

733
00:51:10,783 --> 00:51:13,300
You okay ? Rita said
you got in a bar brawl tonight.

734
00:51:13,335 --> 00:51:14,574
You gotta see this.

735
00:51:15,811 --> 00:51:17,609
<i>Mount Pleasant, at 81 and Salem...</i>

736
00:51:17,644 --> 00:51:19,873
They've been playing it
on the news all night.

737
00:51:23,895 --> 00:51:27,066
<i>Two treasure hunters
made a ghastly discovery today,</i>

738
00:51:27,094 --> 00:51:30,365
<i>when they stumbled on what appears
to be an underwater graveyard,</i>

739
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,468
<i>in a crevasse, off the coast of Miami.</i>

740
00:51:32,766 --> 00:51:34,389
There's bodies in those bags.

741
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:38,776
<i>The butchered bodies were submerged
inside these heavy duty garbage bags.</i>

742
00:51:39,016 --> 00:51:42,029
<i>Authorities have located
at least 30 bags so far,</i>

743
00:51:42,064 --> 00:51:45,123
<i>but around the clock
salvage efforts are still underway.</i>

744
00:51:45,294 --> 00:51:46,694
Did you hear that ?

745
00:51:47,088 --> 00:51:49,086
Thirty bags !
Do you know what that means ?

746
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:52,172
There might be
a new mass murderer out there,

747
00:51:52,207 --> 00:51:53,967
way worse than the Ice Truck Killer.

748
00:51:54,863 --> 00:51:57,015
Maybe I can finally get some peace !

749
00:51:58,277 --> 00:51:59,577
Isn't that great ?

750
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:07,469
It's amazing !
