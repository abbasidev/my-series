1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,745
<i>Previously on Dexter...</i>

2
00:00:04,021 --> 00:00:06,082
Jesus Christ,
you're the Bay Harbor Butcher.

3
00:00:06,444 --> 00:00:07,614
I hate that name.

4
00:00:11,856 --> 00:00:13,500
What's it gonna be, Morgan ?

5
00:00:13,749 --> 00:00:15,300
Kill me now or set me free !

6
00:00:15,542 --> 00:00:18,732
James knows that I believe in him,
so it was worth the risk.

7
00:00:18,892 --> 00:00:20,727
To your job ? To your career ?

8
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:23,475
When you care about someone,
you do what you have to do.

9
00:00:23,717 --> 00:00:26,419
Your credibility was compromised
when you failed to report a call

10
00:00:26,695 --> 00:00:29,147
from the subject
of a goddamn FBI manhunt.

11
00:00:29,389 --> 00:00:32,193
What really pisses me off
is you might be right.

12
00:00:33,084 --> 00:00:35,153
The kids have been through
so much lately.

13
00:00:35,831 --> 00:00:39,241
I don't want them to feel like they've
been abandoned by everyone they love.

14
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,321
Does this mean we're dating again ?

15
00:00:42,778 --> 00:00:45,539
I track killers. That's what I do.
They tend to move around.

16
00:00:46,268 --> 00:00:47,377
I know that.

17
00:00:47,775 --> 00:00:50,916
Then I'm not sure what you thought
would happen when the case ended.

18
00:00:51,857 --> 00:00:53,158
I like it rough.

19
00:01:00,207 --> 00:01:01,207
Jesus.

20
00:01:01,904 --> 00:01:04,193
<i>I don't need Doakes dead.
I just need his fingerprints</i>

21
00:01:04,354 --> 00:01:05,851
<i>to complete my frame job.</i>

22
00:01:06,676 --> 00:01:08,632
<i>Every saturday,
beginning dive classes</i>

23
00:01:08,792 --> 00:01:11,439
<i>practice underwater skills
beside this dock.</i>

24
00:01:11,918 --> 00:01:14,601
<i>Tomorrow they'll find
a morbid little surprise.</i>

25
00:01:15,918 --> 00:01:19,364
I wanna know if there's anything unusual
about my father's death.

26
00:01:20,176 --> 00:01:21,438
He killed himself.

27
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:24,625
<i>The idea of a code was one thing,</i>

28
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:27,325
<i>but the reality of it ?</i>

29
00:01:27,517 --> 00:01:29,882
<i>Harry walked in on what he created...</i>

30
00:01:30,818 --> 00:01:32,968
<i>and he couldn't live with himself.</i>

31
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:40,413
<i>I always thought hardening arteries
squeezed the life out of my father,</i>

32
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,810
<i>but it was me.</i>

33
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:49,797
<i>Harry gazed into the eyes
of his creation and saw evil,</i>

34
00:03:49,986 --> 00:03:51,310
<i>pure and simple.</i>

35
00:03:51,853 --> 00:03:52,974
<i>My evil...</i>

36
00:03:53,138 --> 00:03:54,489
<i>It killed him.</i>

37
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,771
That shit about your father...

38
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:00,250
If you wanna talk about it...

39
00:04:01,513 --> 00:04:02,527
About what ?

40
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:06,156
That my life is one tragic mistake ?

41
00:04:07,369 --> 00:04:09,769
We've all felt that at one time
or another. I have.

42
00:04:10,011 --> 00:04:13,184
Did you happen to be stuffing a human
leg into a garbage bag at that point ?

43
00:04:13,344 --> 00:04:16,027
If you wanna make a change,
now's the time.

44
00:04:16,187 --> 00:04:18,759
All you got to do
is let me out of here.

45
00:04:19,338 --> 00:04:20,645
It's over, man.

46
00:04:20,895 --> 00:04:22,805
It is over when I say it is !

47
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,579
There's that anger again.
You got to let that out, man.

48
00:04:27,957 --> 00:04:30,607
Careful, sergeant,
you might get your wish.

49
00:04:33,204 --> 00:04:35,226
I'm flying without a code here.

50
00:04:35,934 --> 00:04:37,844
I can unleash the beast anytime.

51
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:41,502
- You know that's not the answer.
- But it would feel fucking great.

52
00:04:41,765 --> 00:04:44,234
But you would hate yourself
for the rest of your life.

53
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,762
All the things Harry taught me...

54
00:04:58,977 --> 00:05:00,156
everything...

55
00:05:01,574 --> 00:05:02,801
It's bullshit.

56
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:10,363
It's the only way
I know how to live.

57
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,438
Turn yourself in.

58
00:05:17,046 --> 00:05:18,462
Rule number one...

59
00:05:20,661 --> 00:05:22,061
Don't get caught.

60
00:05:23,715 --> 00:05:25,927
You're spinning. Let me help you.

61
00:05:26,087 --> 00:05:28,194
Sooner or later,
you'll hurt someone else.

62
00:05:28,357 --> 00:05:30,429
I'm talking about your sister

63
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:33,107
or your girlfriend
or even those kids.

64
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:37,173
- I would never...
- No, not on purpose,

65
00:05:37,364 --> 00:05:40,725
but you can't control the shit that's
growing inside of you. It's like cancer.

66
00:05:40,906 --> 00:05:43,841
And in case you haven't noticed,
it's spreading.

67
00:05:45,487 --> 00:05:46,625
End it now.

68
00:05:48,445 --> 00:05:51,063
Take responsibility
for who you are, man.

69
00:05:53,025 --> 00:05:55,438
We'll go to the station together.
I'll help you.

70
00:06:06,261 --> 00:06:07,845
Morgan, don't answer that.

71
00:06:08,093 --> 00:06:09,443
Stay with me, man.

72
00:06:15,017 --> 00:06:16,017
Fuck !

73
00:06:17,227 --> 00:06:18,958
Yes, this is Dexter Morgan.

74
00:06:19,118 --> 00:06:20,597
<i>My name is Dr. Hill.</i>

75
00:06:20,757 --> 00:06:25,067
<i>I work at Good Samaritan hospital.
I'm calling on behalf of Lila Tournay.</i>

76
00:06:25,386 --> 00:06:29,307
<i>- How did you get this number ?
- You're on her emergency contact list.</i>

77
00:06:29,616 --> 00:06:31,791
<i>Ms. Tournay was rushed into our E. R.</i>

78
00:06:32,033 --> 00:06:34,544
In respiratory arrest.
Could you come to the hospital ?

79
00:06:34,786 --> 00:06:37,093
I'm two hours away.
Call somebody else.

80
00:06:38,155 --> 00:06:39,944
There's a legal complication.

81
00:06:41,195 --> 00:06:43,028
What kind of complication ?

82
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:47,449
<i>I can't discuss it over the phone.
You really need to be here.</i>

83
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:54,449
- Where are you going ?
- Don't worry,

84
00:06:54,758 --> 00:06:56,631
I'll send the FBI your way
soon enough.

85
00:06:56,908 --> 00:07:00,789
- You're still gonna try to frame me ?
- I'm kind of down a path here.

86
00:07:01,062 --> 00:07:03,251
You'll get your chance
to tell them I'm the killer,

87
00:07:03,453 --> 00:07:05,867
and they'll ignore you like before,
and I'll...

88
00:07:06,109 --> 00:07:09,064
- And you'll burn in hell.
- Something like that.

89
00:07:58,857 --> 00:08:00,107
He's gone, Dex.

90
00:08:00,857 --> 00:08:02,807
Dad's heart finally gave out.

91
00:08:08,344 --> 00:08:10,890
<i>Harry's heart gave out
when he saw what's inside me.</i>

92
00:08:11,615 --> 00:08:13,932
<i>He thought he could tame it,
give it a purpose,</i>

93
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:16,493
<i>help it find a place
in the natural order.</i>

94
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,743
<i>Guess he was wrong.</i>

95
00:08:25,257 --> 00:08:28,007
I need a second alone with him, okay ?
Thanks.

96
00:08:29,454 --> 00:08:32,330
We spoke on the phone
regarding your girlfriend, Ms. Tournay.

97
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,203
She's not my girlfriend.

98
00:08:35,008 --> 00:08:36,713
I thought she said she was.

99
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,755
- She probably did.
- So, you're...

100
00:08:40,117 --> 00:08:42,362
It's complicated.
Look, why is Angel here ?

101
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:45,591
We found rohypnol,
the date-rape drug,

102
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,417
in Lila's system.

103
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:50,147
With her bruising,
the wound to the back of her head,

104
00:08:50,314 --> 00:08:52,827
we may be looking at a case
of sexual assault.

105
00:08:52,987 --> 00:08:54,600
No, that didn't happen.

106
00:08:54,977 --> 00:08:57,797
Ms. Tournay has no recollection
of what did happen.

107
00:08:58,084 --> 00:09:00,189
She's requested we perform a rape kit.

108
00:09:02,034 --> 00:09:03,608
I need to talk to her.

109
00:09:20,901 --> 00:09:23,295
You came to see me.
You're so sweet.

110
00:09:23,924 --> 00:09:26,152
The doctors think Angel raped you.

111
00:09:30,643 --> 00:09:34,444
- Did he ? Everything's a bit fuzzy.
- This is desperate.

112
00:09:35,318 --> 00:09:38,173
- It won't work.
- What are you talking about ?

113
00:09:39,436 --> 00:09:41,225
I'm just glad you're here.

114
00:09:42,187 --> 00:09:43,832
I missed you so much.

115
00:09:45,199 --> 00:09:47,117
This is how you win me back ?

116
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:50,365
Framing a good man
to get what you want ?

117
00:09:50,896 --> 00:09:53,653
<i>Which is precisely
what I'm doing to Doakes.</i>

118
00:09:56,943 --> 00:09:58,757
What's the matter, Dexter ?

119
00:09:58,962 --> 00:10:00,390
You look so sad...

120
00:10:01,002 --> 00:10:02,002
lost.

121
00:10:04,613 --> 00:10:05,908
Don't do this.

122
00:10:07,703 --> 00:10:09,837
I won't press charges against Angel.

123
00:10:11,112 --> 00:10:12,950
I'll do whatever you want.

124
00:10:16,487 --> 00:10:18,537
If you promise to take me back.

125
00:10:19,761 --> 00:10:21,562
Why can't you just let me go ?

126
00:10:22,074 --> 00:10:24,178
Because I'm your real soul mate.

127
00:10:25,905 --> 00:10:26,970
Not Rita.

128
00:10:27,717 --> 00:10:28,517
Me.

129
00:10:29,818 --> 00:10:30,905
I see you.

130
00:10:31,856 --> 00:10:32,856
Inside.

131
00:10:34,744 --> 00:10:36,196
And I'm the only one.

132
00:10:37,117 --> 00:10:39,000
Look where it's gotten you.

133
00:10:44,494 --> 00:10:47,027
You know that I could never do
anything like that, right ?

134
00:10:47,187 --> 00:10:49,727
You don't even have to say anything.

135
00:10:49,887 --> 00:10:53,057
You warned me about her,
but my dick wouldn't listen.

136
00:10:54,542 --> 00:10:56,741
I could lose everything over this.

137
00:10:58,261 --> 00:10:59,996
What would I say to my little girl ?

138
00:11:00,156 --> 00:11:02,657
The doctor said Lila has 72 h
to press charges.

139
00:11:02,817 --> 00:11:04,397
Maybe she'll come to her senses.

140
00:11:08,486 --> 00:11:12,067
I should get home and grab a few hours
of sleep. Let me get this.

141
00:11:12,313 --> 00:11:13,963
No, back off. I got it.

142
00:11:24,315 --> 00:11:27,249
If I got to choose a person...
A real person...

143
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,071
to be like...

144
00:11:31,187 --> 00:11:33,037
Out of anyone, it'd be you.

145
00:11:36,204 --> 00:11:39,532
I'm not really sure what that means,
but, thanks, Dex.

146
00:11:45,044 --> 00:11:46,760
See you in the morning.

147
00:11:51,257 --> 00:11:55,340
I'd appreciate it if you didn't
mention this to anyone at the station.

148
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:57,507
Of course not.

149
00:11:58,359 --> 00:11:59,359
Thanks.

150
00:12:02,586 --> 00:12:05,359
<i>How did it come to this ?
I've always gone after criminals.</i>

151
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,262
<i>Now I have the fate of two cops
in my hands.</i>

152
00:12:09,325 --> 00:12:12,055
<i>Doakes was right.
The cancer is spreading.</i>

153
00:12:18,282 --> 00:12:21,054
- We're out of yogurt.
- Add it to the list.

154
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:24,428
- We'll stop by the store tonight.
- The store's on the way to work.

155
00:12:24,588 --> 00:12:27,510
It's also on the way home.
We're gonna be late.

156
00:12:27,685 --> 00:12:29,646
Who joined who
in the shower this morning ?

157
00:12:30,481 --> 00:12:33,025
How about, in the futur,
I set the alarm 10 min earlier ?

158
00:12:33,792 --> 00:12:34,855
Make it 20.

159
00:12:35,717 --> 00:12:37,738
"The future",
I'm liking the sound of that.

160
00:12:44,936 --> 00:12:46,496
We're being ordered to work.

161
00:12:46,712 --> 00:12:49,998
You're the head of the task force,
you do the ordering.

162
00:12:53,654 --> 00:12:55,039
Who's D. D. Adams ?

163
00:12:55,572 --> 00:12:56,815
My boss.

164
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,760
<i>Mission accomplished.</i>

165
00:13:02,035 --> 00:13:05,129
<i>The weapons I tossed into the ocean
were found as planned.</i>

166
00:13:05,289 --> 00:13:07,357
<i>One more nail in Doakes' coffin.</i>

167
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,105
All right, people. Listen up.

168
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:13,087
This is FBI deputy director Max Adams.
He just got in from Washington.

169
00:13:13,277 --> 00:13:15,810
He's going to be helping us out
for a while.

170
00:13:18,787 --> 00:13:20,709
Once again, I have pledged

171
00:13:20,986 --> 00:13:23,031
our full cooperation and resources,

172
00:13:23,213 --> 00:13:25,076
so let's make him feel at home.

173
00:13:26,669 --> 00:13:28,896
The murder weapons before you
were found yesterday

174
00:13:29,138 --> 00:13:31,527
by a beginning scuba-diving class.

175
00:13:31,717 --> 00:13:33,888
The instructor
contacted the FBI directly

176
00:13:34,066 --> 00:13:35,759
which brought them to my attention.

177
00:13:35,939 --> 00:13:38,511
Fingerprint analysis ties them
to one James Doakes.

178
00:13:38,782 --> 00:13:41,099
- This doesn't prove a damn thing.
- Not now.

179
00:13:41,358 --> 00:13:44,739
- Why wasn't I brought in on this ?
- You just were, Frank.

180
00:13:45,362 --> 00:13:48,286
- Now, we know sergeant Doakes...
- Lundy better watch his back.

181
00:13:48,464 --> 00:13:51,761
He's abandoned the tools of the trade
that means he's probably on the run.

182
00:13:51,921 --> 00:13:54,865
This footage was taken four days ago
at a mobile station

183
00:13:55,025 --> 00:13:58,201
just off highway 41,
southeast of Naples.

184
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,512
Ladies and gentlemen,
sergeant James Doakes.

185
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:04,658
I can't believe it.

186
00:14:06,185 --> 00:14:07,617
$3.49 for regular ?

187
00:14:09,153 --> 00:14:10,918
So, we...

188
00:14:12,598 --> 00:14:14,358
have let our target get away once.

189
00:14:14,952 --> 00:14:16,703
Let's not drop the ball again.

190
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:18,439
Asshole.

191
00:14:18,729 --> 00:14:21,663
Highway 41 runs
through the Everglades national park.

192
00:14:21,823 --> 00:14:24,993
<i>It won't be long now.
I can hang this on Doakes and then...</i>

193
00:14:28,164 --> 00:14:29,192
<i>Then what ?</i>

194
00:14:29,354 --> 00:14:31,439
<i>Years of trials and appeals with him</i>

195
00:14:31,601 --> 00:14:34,034
<i>pointing his finger
and calling me killer ?</i>

196
00:14:35,892 --> 00:14:39,315
<i>For such a neat monster,
I'm making an awfully big mess.</i>

197
00:15:23,344 --> 00:15:27,363
Where does this prick Adams get off
taking such cheap shots at Lundy ?

198
00:15:27,523 --> 00:15:29,079
I heard that Doakes walked off

199
00:15:29,239 --> 00:15:32,477
in the middle of Lundy's questioning
and that Lundy didn't stop him.

200
00:15:34,669 --> 00:15:36,678
I might have heard that wrong.

201
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:39,679
Peters.

202
00:15:40,144 --> 00:15:42,529
Nice hair, Borelli.
I'm sure the johns up in Boystown

203
00:15:42,771 --> 00:15:44,865
are loving that Duran Duran look.

204
00:15:45,941 --> 00:15:48,201
What ?
You meatheads lose your sense of humor ?

205
00:15:48,977 --> 00:15:50,720
Your joke wasn't funny.

206
00:15:50,896 --> 00:15:53,018
We have a warrant
for detective Batista's arrest.

207
00:15:57,694 --> 00:15:59,167
Bullshit. For what ?

208
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:02,064
A woman named Lila Tournay

209
00:16:02,224 --> 00:16:04,456
has filed sexual-assault charges
against him.

210
00:16:04,616 --> 00:16:05,855
That fucking bitch !

211
00:16:06,015 --> 00:16:07,897
It's okay.
I knew this was coming.

212
00:16:08,102 --> 00:16:09,999
It's not okay. Captain, lieutenant !

213
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:12,486
Put those away
or I will shove them up your ass !

214
00:16:12,646 --> 00:16:13,851
What's going on here ?

215
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:17,378
We've been asked to bring
Batista upstairs for processing

216
00:16:17,657 --> 00:16:20,984
I'm sure that detective Batista
will go along with you peacefully.

217
00:16:25,145 --> 00:16:26,694
It's not your fault.

218
00:16:27,545 --> 00:16:28,721
I'll be okay.

219
00:16:30,478 --> 00:16:32,714
<i>It isn't my fault. I warned Angel.</i>

220
00:16:33,783 --> 00:16:37,053
<i>Still, I hate to see him disgraced
in front of everyone.</i>

221
00:16:39,501 --> 00:16:42,987
<i>And LaGuerta about to lose
her former partner, her friend.</i>

222
00:16:45,535 --> 00:16:49,251
<i>Even Lundy is caught in hurricane
Dexter's path of destruction.</i>

223
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:53,896
<i>Maybe this is how evil works.</i>

224
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:56,531
<i>Destroying everything it touches...</i>

225
00:16:57,518 --> 00:16:59,004
<i>including my father.</i>

226
00:17:05,882 --> 00:17:07,977
You're not gonna believe
the morning I'm having.

227
00:17:08,252 --> 00:17:11,790
<i>- I know the feeling.
- My car is stalled on harper and 3rd.</i>

228
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:14,182
Think you can come get me ?

229
00:17:14,446 --> 00:17:17,436
<i>- Hang tight. I'll be right there.
- Thanks, Dex.</i>

230
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:22,759
<i>I'm the helpful handyman.
How evil can I possibly be ?</i>

231
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:26,258
<i>I'm sparing Rita and Deb
by framing Doakes.</i>

232
00:17:26,691 --> 00:17:27,569
<i>Right ?</i>

233
00:18:25,956 --> 00:18:26,817
Over here !

234
00:18:34,277 --> 00:18:35,353
Thank God.

235
00:18:38,071 --> 00:18:40,394
I've been held prisoner in a cabin
for 2 fucking days.

236
00:18:42,629 --> 00:18:44,234
Fucking hellhole.

237
00:18:46,862 --> 00:18:48,581
I don't wanna go to the cabin.

238
00:18:51,223 --> 00:18:52,939
I need you to get my ass out of here.

239
00:18:53,122 --> 00:18:55,696
I'm a police sergeant.
Miami metro homicide.

240
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:11,071
I gotta run upstairs.
There's a whole Batista thing going on.

241
00:19:11,465 --> 00:19:13,397
- Lunch today ?
- Doubtful.

242
00:19:13,796 --> 00:19:16,993
I've got to write up a status report
for deputy director Adams.

243
00:19:17,235 --> 00:19:18,732
Why'd they send that dipshit ?

244
00:19:18,893 --> 00:19:21,427
Washington gets nervous
when there's no movement on a case,

245
00:19:21,587 --> 00:19:24,054
- especially one as big as this.
- No movement ?

246
00:19:24,422 --> 00:19:27,087
You're the reason they found
the blood slides in Doakes' car.

247
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:29,922
I'm also the one who let him get away.

248
00:19:30,557 --> 00:19:33,206
- We all let him get away.
- I was in charge.

249
00:19:34,117 --> 00:19:35,793
The evidence was there,

250
00:19:36,185 --> 00:19:39,409
but something inside me
wasn't convinced he was our guy so...

251
00:19:39,569 --> 00:19:40,912
I let him walk.

252
00:19:41,393 --> 00:19:42,637
It was a bad call.

253
00:19:43,137 --> 00:19:45,647
- Now we might never...
- Stop it.

254
00:19:46,008 --> 00:19:48,181
- Stop what ?
- Acting like me.

255
00:19:50,328 --> 00:19:52,832
You're a God. Don't you forget it.

256
00:19:57,324 --> 00:19:59,198
So, what do you think it is ?

257
00:19:59,959 --> 00:20:01,269
Carburettor.

258
00:20:01,472 --> 00:20:04,432
Transmission.
That round, black hose thing.

259
00:20:05,865 --> 00:20:07,398
I'm more a boat guy.

260
00:20:07,566 --> 00:20:10,051
The last thing I need right now
is a major repair bill.

261
00:20:10,213 --> 00:20:12,544
Throw in a tow and rental car,

262
00:20:13,538 --> 00:20:16,257
- there goes Astor's piano lessons.
- Take the mini-van.

263
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,636
No, I can't. It's too big
of an inconvenience.

264
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:21,595
You'll drop me at work.
I'll borrow one from the motor pool.

265
00:20:27,112 --> 00:20:28,518
I'll make it up to you.

266
00:20:28,801 --> 00:20:29,826
Dinner ?

267
00:20:31,738 --> 00:20:33,294
I have a better idea.

268
00:20:33,454 --> 00:20:37,471
Pack a lunch, bring the kids,
I'll take you out on the ocean tomorrow.

269
00:20:37,846 --> 00:20:40,724
- The kids have school tomorrow.
- Think of it as a field trip.

270
00:20:41,816 --> 00:20:45,313
You don't know cody's teacher.
- Just one day... Just one more day.

271
00:20:47,693 --> 00:20:49,438
Is everything okay, Dexter ?

272
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:53,390
After everything we've been through
lately, I just want...

273
00:20:53,565 --> 00:20:55,057
to be together with you guys.

274
00:20:55,648 --> 00:20:56,976
Is that selfish ?

275
00:20:59,573 --> 00:21:00,890
No, it's lovely.

276
00:21:11,345 --> 00:21:14,747
<i>Sergeant Doakes can rejoice.
I come bearing real food.</i>

277
00:21:30,619 --> 00:21:31,624
Shit.

278
00:21:34,283 --> 00:21:35,316
All right.

279
00:22:29,354 --> 00:22:31,303
Suck my dick, motherfucker.
You understand ?

280
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:05,003
Friends of yours ?

281
00:23:06,032 --> 00:23:09,295
From what I can tell,
they're friends of that drug dealer.

282
00:23:09,818 --> 00:23:13,042
They would've killed me
once I had all that coke on the boat.

283
00:23:14,963 --> 00:23:16,286
Thanks, Morgan.

284
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:24,182
Well, this is awkward.

285
00:23:29,122 --> 00:23:31,762
I think we made
some alligators very happy.

286
00:23:35,803 --> 00:23:37,136
So, here we are.

287
00:23:38,094 --> 00:23:39,981
Back to fucking square one.

288
00:23:40,428 --> 00:23:41,521
Not exactly.

289
00:23:48,769 --> 00:23:50,242
I'll tell you what, James.

290
00:23:50,904 --> 00:23:53,722
- Can I call you James ?
- Knock yourself out.

291
00:23:58,299 --> 00:23:59,951
I'm toying with an idea...

292
00:24:02,906 --> 00:24:06,046
I've been under federal investigation
for two months.

293
00:24:08,356 --> 00:24:09,839
My trophies were stolen.

294
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:12,839
Sorry.

295
00:24:13,688 --> 00:24:16,038
The code I live by has been shattered.

296
00:24:19,085 --> 00:24:21,160
And I have a co-worker in a cage.

297
00:24:21,327 --> 00:24:22,831
Things aren't going so well.

298
00:24:24,709 --> 00:24:26,440
No shit. I can see that.

299
00:24:26,955 --> 00:24:28,111
You told me...

300
00:24:29,293 --> 00:24:31,721
to take responsibility for what I am.

301
00:24:32,955 --> 00:24:34,275
You were right.

302
00:24:37,228 --> 00:24:39,247
Harry killed the wrong person.

303
00:24:39,651 --> 00:24:43,465
- Morgan, you're not thinking about...
- Kill myself ? No, that's pathetic.

304
00:24:47,873 --> 00:24:50,856
But I can't live
in this house of cards anymore,

305
00:24:51,234 --> 00:24:53,290
waiting for it all to fall down.

306
00:24:53,581 --> 00:24:55,759
I need to do something, you know ?

307
00:25:04,187 --> 00:25:06,166
I'm thinking about turning myself in.

308
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:16,933
That's a good call, Morgan.
That's a tough call,

309
00:25:17,939 --> 00:25:19,669
but that's a good call, man.

310
00:25:24,636 --> 00:25:26,582
I need some fucking relief.

311
00:25:27,441 --> 00:25:29,594
Yeah, you can't keep running, man.

312
00:25:29,993 --> 00:25:31,227
That's for pussies.

313
00:25:31,387 --> 00:25:34,490
You're just gonna end up
in exactly the same situation...

314
00:25:34,748 --> 00:25:36,728
- sooner or later.
- Prison.

315
00:25:40,508 --> 00:25:42,462
I could finally get some sleep.

316
00:25:44,132 --> 00:25:45,132
Yeah.

317
00:25:47,785 --> 00:25:50,466
In the long run
it would be easier on Deb...

318
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:00,793
Better than watching me
dragged in like an animal...

319
00:26:02,071 --> 00:26:04,403
Which, let's face it, will happen...

320
00:26:04,934 --> 00:26:06,055
someday.

321
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,232
Morgan, we'll do it together.

322
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:12,153
I'll go with you.

323
00:26:12,783 --> 00:26:13,879
Come on, let's go.

324
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:18,780
If I do this, I need a day
to get my affairs in order.

325
00:26:19,042 --> 00:26:21,282
Fine. Tie me up,
throw me in the trunk. Let's go.

326
00:26:21,544 --> 00:26:23,946
I brought supplies. Fresh fruit.

327
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:27,698
Mention that when they interview you
for the story of my life.

328
00:26:27,858 --> 00:26:31,764
Don't leave me in this cage, anything
could happen. What're you doing ?

329
00:26:32,055 --> 00:26:34,395
I think we've seen the worst of that.

330
00:26:42,999 --> 00:26:45,730
I've really enjoyed
our conversations, James.

331
00:26:48,728 --> 00:26:50,578
I lie to everyone I know...

332
00:26:53,088 --> 00:26:55,804
except my victims
right before I kill them.

333
00:26:57,744 --> 00:27:00,611
It's hard to establish
much of a rapport there.

334
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:09,881
Sorry about the cage.

335
00:27:15,473 --> 00:27:16,473
Fuck.

336
00:27:53,884 --> 00:27:56,377
<i>- What ?
- It's me. What are you doing tonight ?</i>

337
00:27:56,639 --> 00:27:58,817
I'm about to get off of work, why ?

338
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:03,166
I've got some papers
I need you to sign.

339
00:28:03,479 --> 00:28:05,053
Papers ? What kind of papers ?

340
00:28:07,388 --> 00:28:09,269
I'll explain when I see you.

341
00:28:09,509 --> 00:28:11,414
<i>I'm meeting Masuka
and Batista for drinks.</i>

342
00:28:11,593 --> 00:28:13,922
<i>Why don't you bring the papers
and join us ?</i>

343
00:28:15,808 --> 00:28:18,683
- How's Angel doing ?
- How do you think he's doing ?

344
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:21,611
It's your fault he's in this mess.
If you hadn't fucked Elvira.

345
00:28:22,301 --> 00:28:24,414
I'm not the best brother, am I ?

346
00:28:25,628 --> 00:28:27,757
Dexter, are you smoking something ?

347
00:28:30,457 --> 00:28:33,456
I've always been curious to try.
Do you have any weed ?

348
00:28:33,948 --> 00:28:35,697
Okay, now I'm really worried.

349
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,217
There's no need to worry.

350
00:28:39,709 --> 00:28:41,467
I'll bring by the papers tomorrow.

351
00:28:45,178 --> 00:28:47,628
<i>It's strange.
This should be difficult,</i>

352
00:28:47,788 --> 00:28:50,338
<i>but a sense of peace
is settling over me.</i>

353
00:28:51,036 --> 00:28:52,036
<i>Calm.</i>

354
00:28:55,188 --> 00:28:56,966
<i>Maybe it's the moonlight.</i>

355
00:29:04,028 --> 00:29:04,828
Tom ?

356
00:29:06,724 --> 00:29:08,423
Can I meet you outside ?

357
00:29:08,972 --> 00:29:09,972
Sure.

358
00:29:11,217 --> 00:29:12,886
I'll check in back home.

359
00:29:14,779 --> 00:29:16,044
I need a personal day.

360
00:29:16,879 --> 00:29:18,219
I hope it's a joke.

361
00:29:18,661 --> 00:29:21,323
Just one day.
I think I can prove James is innocent.

362
00:29:21,483 --> 00:29:23,096
I talked to a couple of FBI agents

363
00:29:23,258 --> 00:29:25,328
- who were in Haiti...
- Jesus, Maria.

364
00:29:25,496 --> 00:29:27,328
We're in the middle of a manhunt.

365
00:29:27,488 --> 00:29:30,649
You're down two detectives
and now you want time off ?

366
00:29:30,836 --> 00:29:32,604
No. We can't spare you right now.

367
00:29:32,915 --> 00:29:34,555
This wasn't a request.

368
00:29:35,518 --> 00:29:38,910
I won't be here tomorrow.
I just wanted you to know that.

369
00:29:43,441 --> 00:29:45,975
<i>- Diablo.
- What is this shit, Masuka ?</i>

370
00:29:46,291 --> 00:29:50,108
- Hey, tequila's all the same.
- Not when it's made from pumpkins.

371
00:29:50,309 --> 00:29:52,003
We're not in the same pay grade.

372
00:29:52,245 --> 00:29:54,311
If I lose my job over this, bro,

373
00:29:54,812 --> 00:29:57,078
- I won't have a pay grade.
- It won't happen.

374
00:29:57,238 --> 00:30:00,136
- We all know you're innocent.
- How am I gonna prove it ?

375
00:30:01,127 --> 00:30:03,947
I can't explain the roofies,
the rough sex.

376
00:30:04,507 --> 00:30:06,225
- Rough sex ?
- It was her idea.

377
00:30:06,467 --> 00:30:08,989
Now it's my word against hers.
I'm screwed.

378
00:30:09,901 --> 00:30:12,815
- You have got to fight back.
- Dude, Morgan's right.

379
00:30:13,087 --> 00:30:16,027
You got to man up, get tough.
Love's a battlefield.

380
00:30:16,269 --> 00:30:18,224
Or in your case, a restraining order.

381
00:30:20,542 --> 00:30:23,785
I appreciate you guys doing this,
but you don't have to stay.

382
00:30:24,917 --> 00:30:26,566
Does it ever floor you guys

383
00:30:26,863 --> 00:30:29,628
that we had a killer
right under our noses this whole time ?

384
00:30:29,788 --> 00:30:32,024
I mean, who doesn't see that shit ?

385
00:30:34,586 --> 00:30:35,992
That didn't come out right.

386
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,334
It's all right.

387
00:30:38,546 --> 00:30:40,675
That stuff doesn't bother me anymore.

388
00:30:40,837 --> 00:30:42,337
Next round's on me.

389
00:31:06,139 --> 00:31:08,275
I was wondering when you'd show up.

390
00:31:08,923 --> 00:31:10,180
We need to talk.

391
00:31:10,488 --> 00:31:11,838
Sounds good to me.

392
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:16,418
I'm making coffee. Do you want one ?

393
00:31:16,704 --> 00:31:20,684
I'm here to ask you respectfully
to drop the charges against Angel.

394
00:31:25,137 --> 00:31:28,994
If Angel molested me,
as the evidence seems to indicate,

395
00:31:30,101 --> 00:31:33,395
then he should face
the consequences. Don't you think ?

396
00:31:34,453 --> 00:31:36,478
It doesn't matter what I think.

397
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,896
But here's what I know.

398
00:31:39,987 --> 00:31:42,006
After tomorrow,
I won't be around anymore,

399
00:31:42,172 --> 00:31:44,005
so there's no end game in this for you.

400
00:31:45,368 --> 00:31:46,697
You're going somewhere ?

401
00:31:48,357 --> 00:31:50,167
It's looking more and more likely.

402
00:31:50,802 --> 00:31:51,802
Where ?

403
00:31:51,973 --> 00:31:55,053
All that matters is that I'll be
out of reach permanently.

404
00:31:55,214 --> 00:31:56,127
Come on !

405
00:31:56,369 --> 00:31:58,129
Tell me. I have a right to know.

406
00:31:58,387 --> 00:32:01,348
You're the one who taught me
to accept the things I can't change.

407
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:03,111
This is one of those things.

408
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:13,011
I don't understand
how men can be so stupid.

409
00:32:14,427 --> 00:32:15,535
Not all men.

410
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:18,149
Yes, every single one of you.

411
00:32:19,362 --> 00:32:22,848
I mean, how could Dexter and Batista
be so easily duped by Lila ?

412
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:26,199
I took one look at her,
I knew she was a walking nightmare.

413
00:32:27,421 --> 00:32:30,245
That's not stupidity.
It's simply in our DNA.

414
00:32:30,627 --> 00:32:34,332
When a pretty girl smiles and bats
her eyelashes, we're unable to resist.

415
00:32:37,338 --> 00:32:39,115
I'm worried about Batista.

416
00:32:40,006 --> 00:32:43,235
This is so fucked.
I won't let him take the fall for this.

417
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:44,615
What can you do ?

418
00:32:52,289 --> 00:32:54,625
I was wondering if you might access

419
00:32:54,893 --> 00:32:57,113
those great, big FBI files of yours

420
00:32:57,273 --> 00:32:59,678
and do a search on Miss Lila Tournay.

421
00:33:02,373 --> 00:33:04,414
You see ? Powerless to resist.

422
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:08,950
Will Adams be pissed off when he sees
you used FBI files for this ?

423
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:10,653
I certainly hope so.

424
00:33:17,113 --> 00:33:18,613
She has no warrants.

425
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:21,735
No criminal record.

426
00:33:23,471 --> 00:33:25,285
Nothing with the DMV.

427
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,847
And no social security number.

428
00:33:31,934 --> 00:33:34,744
What about visas
or green cards or whatever ?

429
00:33:35,148 --> 00:33:36,661
Nothing. No records.

430
00:33:37,837 --> 00:33:40,721
That's impossible.
Everyone has a paper trail.

431
00:33:42,179 --> 00:33:43,395
Everyone real.

432
00:33:45,395 --> 00:33:47,975
That sneaky bitch.
She's using an alias.

433
00:33:48,476 --> 00:33:49,867
That would be my guess.

434
00:33:50,042 --> 00:33:52,373
How do I find out Lila's real name ?

435
00:33:52,816 --> 00:33:55,100
I think you know the answer to that.

436
00:33:56,127 --> 00:33:58,410
Cut off her head, look for a label.

437
00:34:00,351 --> 00:34:02,418
There's probably an easier way.

438
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,283
You got something smaller ?

439
00:34:13,554 --> 00:34:16,851
The last time she was in my apartment,
she microwaved some popcorn.

440
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:19,517
There's definitely gonna be prints
on this.

441
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:22,561
All right, got it.

442
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:25,081
Next time, make her a cup of tea.

443
00:34:33,421 --> 00:34:35,286
This is Marlene from accounting.

444
00:34:35,528 --> 00:34:37,163
Hi, Marlene from accounting.

445
00:34:37,405 --> 00:34:39,206
She's also a notary public.

446
00:34:40,071 --> 00:34:42,747
- Good for you.
- I met with a lawyer yesterday.

447
00:34:43,045 --> 00:34:46,255
He helped me prepare a living trust
that gives you control of all my assets

448
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,248
in the event of my death or...

449
00:34:49,939 --> 00:34:51,416
certain other situations.

450
00:34:51,849 --> 00:34:53,748
God. Go away. This is creepy.

451
00:34:54,215 --> 00:34:56,825
My financial planner said
a guy my age should have a will.

452
00:34:56,987 --> 00:34:59,609
- Just a precaution.
- We're all gonna die eventually.

453
00:35:06,019 --> 00:35:09,020
Is this why you were acting so weird
last night ?

454
00:35:09,629 --> 00:35:11,187
- Probably.
- Sign here

455
00:35:11,445 --> 00:35:13,134
and I'll need to see an ID.

456
00:35:13,432 --> 00:35:14,432
Fine.

457
00:35:16,487 --> 00:35:18,910
Thanks for showing up last night
to support Batista.

458
00:35:19,073 --> 00:35:21,999
I am supporting him.
I stopped by Lila's this morning.

459
00:35:22,781 --> 00:35:23,604
And ?

460
00:35:23,787 --> 00:35:26,504
I talked to her.
I don't think she's gonna be a problem.

461
00:35:27,356 --> 00:35:30,316
Yeah, 'cause she certainly
hasn't been one so far.

462
00:35:32,742 --> 00:35:35,114
I'm free tonight, you wanna stop by ?
We'll have beer,

463
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:38,098
a couple of steaks ?
I wanna talk to you about something.

464
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,257
Sounds good.

465
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,526
So, what am I getting ?
I could use a new TV.

466
00:35:51,028 --> 00:35:52,857
Okay. But that's the one.

467
00:35:53,264 --> 00:35:54,405
<i>Lundy here.</i>

468
00:35:55,943 --> 00:35:58,703
It's lieutenant LaGuerta.
I'm calling you from Haiti.

469
00:35:59,171 --> 00:36:00,771
Lovely this time of year.

470
00:36:01,057 --> 00:36:02,948
I know I'm not your favorite person

471
00:36:03,108 --> 00:36:05,998
in the station right now,
but I really need your help.

472
00:36:06,523 --> 00:36:07,523
<i>How so ?</i>

473
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:11,465
I just met with Leones,
the travel agent that Doakes saw.

474
00:36:11,707 --> 00:36:15,136
There's nothing new there.
I had two agents question him for hours.

475
00:36:15,582 --> 00:36:18,301
Yet he never told them
about the blood slides.

476
00:36:18,461 --> 00:36:20,527
What does he know
about the blood slides ?

477
00:36:20,687 --> 00:36:23,593
<i>Doakes was looking for a lab
to have them analyzed.</i>

478
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,947
- Why ?
- I don't know why.

479
00:36:26,107 --> 00:36:27,998
If he's our killer,
he'd keep as trophies.

480
00:36:28,158 --> 00:36:29,775
He wouldn't have them analyzed.

481
00:36:30,017 --> 00:36:32,468
And I also have a list
of special-ops missions

482
00:36:32,628 --> 00:36:35,328
that Leones personally knows
Doakes took part in.

483
00:36:35,488 --> 00:36:37,998
Two of them directly conflict
with murders

484
00:36:38,158 --> 00:36:41,162
we know to have been committed
by the Bay Harbor Butcher.

485
00:36:41,404 --> 00:36:43,776
I'm not sure Leones
is our most reliable witness.

486
00:36:43,938 --> 00:36:45,154
No, but...

487
00:36:45,731 --> 00:36:47,987
it's worth looking into, isn't it ?

488
00:36:50,021 --> 00:36:51,724
Yes. Yes, it is.

489
00:36:53,958 --> 00:36:56,131
For starters, why don't you...

490
00:36:57,579 --> 00:36:59,630
brief me on both those missions ?

491
00:37:00,464 --> 00:37:02,139
Give me all the details.

492
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,360
Come on, Cody. Up and over.

493
00:37:08,862 --> 00:37:11,267
Okay, Astor. Up and over.
There we go.

494
00:37:15,172 --> 00:37:16,442
Watch your step.

495
00:37:32,086 --> 00:37:34,451
- Look, a pelican !
- There's a bunch of them, there.

496
00:37:34,613 --> 00:37:35,789
What's that ?

497
00:38:14,821 --> 00:38:18,091
<i>Welcome to the GPS 3000 teletracker.</i>

498
00:38:20,025 --> 00:38:21,660
<i>Previous destinations.</i>

499
00:38:32,069 --> 00:38:35,380
<i>For so long my boat has been a tool
of my dark trade...</i>

500
00:38:35,557 --> 00:38:36,968
<i>A graveyard transport.</i>

501
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:40,409
<i>I'd almost forgotten it could double
as a pleasure craft.</i>

502
00:38:40,569 --> 00:38:42,527
The thing is, if you catch a whale,

503
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:44,790
we're probably gonna have
to put it back.

504
00:38:44,966 --> 00:38:47,389
If it's a baby,
we could put it in the bathtub.

505
00:38:47,549 --> 00:38:49,553
I'm not gonna take a bath
with a whale.

506
00:38:49,713 --> 00:38:51,686
Yes, they always use up
all the soap.

507
00:39:00,778 --> 00:39:02,219
It's peaceful out here.

508
00:39:09,674 --> 00:39:12,178
Rita, I've never been
a very good boyfriend.

509
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:14,734
I wouldn't say that.

510
00:39:17,715 --> 00:39:19,808
I just need you to know that...

511
00:39:20,381 --> 00:39:23,195
you and the kids
are very important to me.

512
00:39:25,171 --> 00:39:28,189
No matter what happens,
I want you to always know that.

513
00:39:36,996 --> 00:39:38,652
Everything's all right.

514
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:43,052
I just need to take things slow.

515
00:39:46,959 --> 00:39:49,379
- I have a gift for you.
- You don't need to.

516
00:39:49,555 --> 00:39:51,299
I want you to have this.

517
00:39:51,574 --> 00:39:53,479
It's the pink slip to the mini-van.

518
00:39:53,898 --> 00:39:56,690
- I told you we're okay. You don't...
- Please.

519
00:39:56,932 --> 00:39:59,219
Take it for the kids.
It'll keep them safer

520
00:39:59,379 --> 00:40:01,373
than a broken-down convertible.

521
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,259
Thank you.

522
00:40:06,533 --> 00:40:07,774
Very generous.

523
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,499
You're welcome.

524
00:40:11,946 --> 00:40:15,501
I know I've been
taking things slow with us,

525
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,997
but it's not
because I don't have feelings for you.

526
00:40:19,157 --> 00:40:20,798
It's more like I have

527
00:40:21,288 --> 00:40:24,885
too many feelings, and I just wanna
make sure to get it right.

528
00:40:27,236 --> 00:40:28,287
Me too.

529
00:40:39,652 --> 00:40:42,101
That's not exactly taking it slow.

530
00:40:43,549 --> 00:40:45,820
Sorry. I'll never do that again.

531
00:40:47,224 --> 00:40:48,867
Well, don't say never.

532
00:40:58,965 --> 00:41:00,263
I was looking for you.

533
00:41:00,423 --> 00:41:03,573
The boys looked at Lila's prints.
We hit the jackpot.

534
00:41:04,005 --> 00:41:05,552
Her real name is Lila West.

535
00:41:05,712 --> 00:41:08,274
I ran her prints through the AFIS,
which is tied to ICE.

536
00:41:08,436 --> 00:41:11,558
Get this...
Her visa expired two years ago.

537
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,760
- Bad girl.
- I can have her deported.

538
00:41:15,245 --> 00:41:17,059
Not as easy as it sounds.

539
00:41:17,452 --> 00:41:22,359
Miami's swamped with criminal immigrants
and refugees from 3rd world countries.

540
00:41:22,566 --> 00:41:24,668
They'll take priority
over some British girl.

541
00:41:24,828 --> 00:41:26,236
Then I'll deport her myself.

542
00:41:26,638 --> 00:41:27,781
We got him.

543
00:41:29,066 --> 00:41:31,402
Talked to a park-service manager
in the Everglades

544
00:41:31,564 --> 00:41:34,663
who remembers giving Sergeant Doakes
directions 5 days ago.

545
00:41:35,069 --> 00:41:36,790
So you have a tip... not Doakes.

546
00:41:37,032 --> 00:41:39,710
The park manager said our target
was headed into the Everglades

547
00:41:39,952 --> 00:41:42,379
15 miles north of Sunday Bay.
We will have

548
00:41:42,621 --> 00:41:45,147
the son of a bitch in handcuffs
in 24 hours.

549
00:41:45,307 --> 00:41:48,051
I'd like to urge strong caution
in apprehending the suspect.

550
00:41:48,471 --> 00:41:50,572
I'm looking into new intel
that might come...

551
00:41:50,774 --> 00:41:52,756
I got your e-mail about Leones.

552
00:41:52,916 --> 00:41:54,626
He will say anything for a dollar.

553
00:41:54,786 --> 00:41:56,667
I agree we have to be careful
about this,

554
00:41:56,844 --> 00:41:58,562
which is why I'd like some time.

555
00:41:58,804 --> 00:42:00,990
Show a little guts,
for Christ's sakes.

556
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:02,900
Why don't you show a little respect ?

557
00:42:03,516 --> 00:42:06,528
You wouldn't be closing in on a suspect
if it wasn't for his work.

558
00:42:08,552 --> 00:42:11,402
You know, as much as I enjoy
hearing from the local talent,

559
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:13,994
I'm really rather busy right now.

560
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:20,463
I guess you don't need me
to fight your battles anymore.

561
00:42:20,623 --> 00:42:22,843
Maybe you need me to fight yours.

562
00:42:23,209 --> 00:42:24,628
Aren't you a tough one ?

563
00:42:24,788 --> 00:42:26,326
I'm just warming up.

564
00:42:39,539 --> 00:42:41,677
I thought I lived in a shit can.

565
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,235
Officer Morgan, have you come
to inquire about my welfare ?

566
00:42:46,477 --> 00:42:48,698
I want you to leave Miami tonight.

567
00:42:49,219 --> 00:42:50,516
Don't ever come back.

568
00:42:50,676 --> 00:42:53,075
Don't ever contact Angel
or Dexter again.

569
00:42:55,083 --> 00:42:56,083
And...

570
00:42:56,790 --> 00:42:58,497
why would I listen to you ?

571
00:42:58,739 --> 00:42:59,969
Cause I'm a cop.

572
00:43:00,158 --> 00:43:01,959
And you're here on an expired visa.

573
00:43:04,661 --> 00:43:07,456
I know your real name,
and I've contacted Immigration.

574
00:43:07,616 --> 00:43:09,528
Officers will be here any day now.

575
00:43:09,688 --> 00:43:11,931
They'll arrest you and deport you,

576
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:14,722
and it won't be pretty.

577
00:43:14,911 --> 00:43:17,307
If this is true,
why are you telling me this ?

578
00:43:17,692 --> 00:43:20,527
Because I want you the fuck
out of here now.

579
00:43:21,638 --> 00:43:24,719
Whether you leave on your own
or Immigration hauls your sorry ass away

580
00:43:24,885 --> 00:43:27,863
I don't give a shit. But I don't want
to give you one more day

581
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:30,273
to fuck with the people I care about.

582
00:43:30,761 --> 00:43:33,031
I want you gone. Tonight.

583
00:43:33,622 --> 00:43:35,325
You don't want to do this.

584
00:43:36,175 --> 00:43:37,261
It's done.

585
00:43:39,411 --> 00:43:40,411
Tonight.

586
00:44:08,377 --> 00:44:11,653
<i>Welcome. Previous destination.
Starting route guidance.</i>

587
00:44:12,643 --> 00:44:13,969
<i>Left turn ahead.</i>

588
00:44:24,105 --> 00:44:27,836
<i>I keep expecting to come to my senses,
but the pressure is lifting</i>

589
00:44:28,078 --> 00:44:29,642
<i>with each step I take.</i>

590
00:44:30,926 --> 00:44:32,799
<i>I've spent a lifetime keeping up</i>

591
00:44:33,041 --> 00:44:36,470
<i>my guard, watching my back,
wearing my mask.</i>

592
00:44:37,062 --> 00:44:39,211
<i>Relief was never in sight</i>

593
00:44:39,756 --> 00:44:40,866
<i>until now.</i>

594
00:44:43,063 --> 00:44:46,254
<i>If anyone deserves to take me
into custody, it's Deb.</i>

595
00:44:47,228 --> 00:44:49,289
<i>But how do I tell her what I am ?</i>

596
00:45:04,861 --> 00:45:06,541
I'm the Bay Harbor Butcher.

597
00:45:13,582 --> 00:45:15,766
Deb, I'm the Bay Harbor Butcher.

598
00:45:16,305 --> 00:45:18,136
Down on the ground, motherfucker.

599
00:45:18,573 --> 00:45:21,068
It's me.
I'm the Bay Harbor Butcher.

600
00:45:24,635 --> 00:45:25,560
I'm him...

601
00:45:25,802 --> 00:45:26,937
the Butcher.

602
00:45:32,184 --> 00:45:34,109
<i>This isn't going to be easy.</i>

603
00:45:36,798 --> 00:45:38,424
I brought extra beer.

604
00:45:38,616 --> 00:45:40,162
We're getting drunk.

605
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:42,398
Fine with me.

606
00:45:47,747 --> 00:45:49,242
What's the occasion ?

607
00:45:51,183 --> 00:45:53,342
I ran Lila out of town today.

608
00:45:55,821 --> 00:45:56,828
Really ?

609
00:45:57,605 --> 00:46:00,738
Turns out she's here illegally.
You should have seen me, Dex.

610
00:46:00,898 --> 00:46:03,023
I was like an Old-West sheriff.

611
00:46:08,296 --> 00:46:10,165
You're really feeling good.

612
00:46:12,669 --> 00:46:13,775
Fuck, yeah.

613
00:46:14,977 --> 00:46:18,311
I got to say, great timing, Dex,
getting together tonight.

614
00:46:18,512 --> 00:46:21,700
Lately, I was starting to feel like
I had my head pretty far up my ass.

615
00:46:22,925 --> 00:46:24,340
No one blames you.

616
00:46:25,122 --> 00:46:27,320
Your world was turned upside down.

617
00:46:28,105 --> 00:46:29,549
<i>Like mine is now.</i>

618
00:46:30,015 --> 00:46:32,443
For the 1st time
since that Ice-Truck Killer shit,

619
00:46:32,603 --> 00:46:34,176
I feel like I'm back.

620
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:36,581
New and improved, even.

621
00:46:48,327 --> 00:46:49,611
When all that...

622
00:46:51,035 --> 00:46:53,841
stuff was happening...
With Rudy, I mean...

623
00:46:59,889 --> 00:47:02,986
did you ever consider
doing something drastic ?

624
00:47:06,484 --> 00:47:07,621
Are you kidding ?

625
00:47:10,514 --> 00:47:13,396
All kinds of fucked-up shit
ran through my head.

626
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:15,664
Thank God I had you.

627
00:47:17,696 --> 00:47:18,662
Really ?

628
00:47:19,538 --> 00:47:23,095
Every time I started to spin
out of control, I had you to grab onto.

629
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:26,953
Hell, you let me live here
practically forever.

630
00:47:27,607 --> 00:47:29,225
It was tough, though.

631
00:47:30,007 --> 00:47:33,748
I'd have done almost anything to get
out from under the weight of it all.

632
00:47:37,631 --> 00:47:39,330
How'd you finally do it ?

633
00:47:43,029 --> 00:47:44,046
I just...

634
00:47:45,256 --> 00:47:46,603
saw through it.

635
00:47:47,688 --> 00:47:48,774
You know ?

636
00:47:49,847 --> 00:47:51,526
You decide who you are,

637
00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:53,375
who you want to be...

638
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:58,742
and you hold onto that

639
00:48:00,368 --> 00:48:01,644
and ride it out.

640
00:48:08,972 --> 00:48:10,776
Like an Old-West sheriff.

641
00:48:18,042 --> 00:48:18,900
Brother,

642
00:48:19,723 --> 00:48:21,933
this is worth living for.

643
00:48:25,891 --> 00:48:26,891
Right ?

644
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,657
You are absolutely right.

645
00:48:37,614 --> 00:48:39,394
What did you want
to talk to me about ?

646
00:48:44,485 --> 00:48:45,494
Nothing.

647
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:49,518
Nothing at all.

648
00:48:55,505 --> 00:48:57,511
<i>So this is me, riding it out.</i>

649
00:48:58,545 --> 00:49:01,491
<i>Harry may have rejected me,
but Deb clearly believes in me,</i>

650
00:49:01,651 --> 00:49:03,166
<i>so why shouldn't I ?</i>

651
00:49:03,517 --> 00:49:05,325
<i>I'm not turning myself in.</i>

652
00:49:05,563 --> 00:49:07,277
<i>This isn't Harry's life.</i>

653
00:49:07,557 --> 00:49:08,566
<i>It's mine.</i>

654
00:49:08,913 --> 00:49:12,037
<i>I made a plan to frame Doakes,
and I'm going to stick with it.</i>

655
00:49:20,086 --> 00:49:21,095
No shit ?

656
00:49:24,553 --> 00:49:26,016
I'm on the way.

657
00:49:26,194 --> 00:49:28,571
They found Doakes'
fucking rental car.

658
00:49:28,758 --> 00:49:29,996
They found...

659
00:49:30,714 --> 00:49:33,697
Really ? His car ?
Did they find Doakes ?

660
00:49:33,869 --> 00:49:36,001
Not yet.
But the search grid's closing in.

661
00:49:36,161 --> 00:49:37,812
We got to get to the station.

662
00:49:38,054 --> 00:49:41,316
<i>Actually I got to make sure
they don't find Doakes in a cage.</i>

663
00:49:51,350 --> 00:49:52,463
Hallelujah.

664
00:49:57,143 --> 00:49:58,558
Hey, I'm in here !

665
00:50:00,948 --> 00:50:02,879
Who's out there ?
Anybody out there ?

666
00:50:05,494 --> 00:50:07,136
<i>Ending route guidance.</i>

667
00:50:16,647 --> 00:50:18,075
Somebody in there ?

668
00:50:21,536 --> 00:50:23,924
<i>You have arrived
at your destination.</i>
