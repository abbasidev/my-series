1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,919
<i>Previously on Dexter...</i>

2
00:00:04,203 --> 00:00:06,255
I was working on my piece
with the blowtorch

3
00:00:06,529 --> 00:00:08,373
and it caught fire. I was so scared.

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:12,510
We could always get in the car
and pass the time like we used to.

5
00:00:13,453 --> 00:00:16,465
You're giving Doakes to the press ?
He is not your man !

6
00:00:16,748 --> 00:00:19,457
Your credibility was compromised
when you failed to report a call

7
00:00:19,727 --> 00:00:22,131
from the subject
of a goddamn FBI manhunt.

8
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,263
Who joined who in the shower earlier ?

9
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:26,786
What if I set the alarm 10 min earlier
in the future ?

10
00:00:26,976 --> 00:00:28,656
"Future", I like the sound of that.

11
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,452
A woman named Lila Tournay
has filled sexual assault charges

12
00:00:32,735 --> 00:00:34,670
- against him.
- The fucking bitch !

13
00:00:34,942 --> 00:00:36,984
I could lose everything over this.

14
00:00:37,268 --> 00:00:38,820
Why can't you just let me go ?

15
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:40,804
Because I'm your real soulmate.

16
00:00:44,568 --> 00:00:45,568
Not Rita.

17
00:00:49,999 --> 00:00:52,018
Jesus Christ,
you're the Bay Harbor Butcher.

18
00:00:52,591 --> 00:00:54,234
I really hate that name.

19
00:00:57,089 --> 00:01:00,450
What's it gonna be, Morgan ?
Kill me now or set me free.

20
00:01:00,709 --> 00:01:02,742
Don't worry,
I'll send the FBI soon enough.

21
00:01:02,902 --> 00:01:05,537
<i>- You're still gonna try to frame me ?
- Mission accomplished.</i>

22
00:01:05,697 --> 00:01:07,473
<i>One more nail in Doakes' coffin.</i>

23
00:01:07,721 --> 00:01:10,068
- We got him.
- So you have a tip, not Doakes.

24
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:13,665
Parc manager said our target was heading
into the Everglades. We will have

25
00:01:13,956 --> 00:01:16,314
the son of a bitch
in the handcuffs in 24 hours.

26
00:01:17,252 --> 00:01:19,637
Do not ever go to Rita's house again.

27
00:01:20,031 --> 00:01:21,468
Stay away from Rita.

28
00:01:22,951 --> 00:01:24,491
Stay away from me.

29
00:01:24,972 --> 00:01:27,961
Whether you leave on your own or
Immigration hauls your sorry ass away,

30
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:29,313
I don't give a shit.

31
00:01:29,473 --> 00:01:32,699
But I don't want you to fuck
with the people I care about 1 more day.

32
00:01:36,477 --> 00:01:38,113
<i>Previous destinations.</i>

33
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:41,688
- They found Doakes' rental car.
- Did they find him ?

34
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:43,942
Not yet, but the search grid
is closing in.

35
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,976
Who's out there ? Anybody out there ?

36
00:01:49,784 --> 00:01:51,746
<i>You have arrived at your destination.</i>

37
00:01:52,498 --> 00:01:54,169
Somebody in there ?

38
00:03:58,323 --> 00:03:59,958
Hello, who's out there ?

39
00:04:07,654 --> 00:04:08,823
I need some help !

40
00:04:09,911 --> 00:04:11,391
Get me out of here !

41
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:14,900
Who are you ?

42
00:04:15,247 --> 00:04:16,590
Just open the door !

43
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,387
I'm being held captive.

44
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:32,183
Leave the mess for once.
Walk away from the mess.

45
00:04:32,368 --> 00:04:34,334
- I can't do that.
- We need you.

46
00:04:34,498 --> 00:04:37,402
Lundy's mobilizing every agency
in 5 counties. We're closing in.

47
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:39,440
You've a rental car, not Doakes.

48
00:04:39,722 --> 00:04:40,949
God, come on !

49
00:04:41,772 --> 00:04:44,307
- I'm only helpful if there's blood.
- Maybe we'll shoot him.

50
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,368
You'll need a paramedic, not me.

51
00:04:46,692 --> 00:04:50,554
- Are you afraid to face Doakes ?
- Yes. Of course I'm afraid to face him.

52
00:04:51,973 --> 00:04:54,961
- And I have dishes to do.
- OK. I'll let you know when it's over.

53
00:04:58,323 --> 00:05:00,097
It's Doakes. You hate the guy.

54
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:03,712
I used to. I can't even afford
to think of him as a person anymore.

55
00:05:05,969 --> 00:05:07,452
Would you get going ?

56
00:05:07,837 --> 00:05:08,837
I tried.

57
00:05:11,517 --> 00:05:13,515
<i>If they find Doakes
locked inside a cage,</i>

58
00:05:13,686 --> 00:05:15,666
<i>it'll seriously undermine
my frame job.</i>

59
00:05:18,635 --> 00:05:20,605
<i>I need to beat them to that cabin.</i>

60
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,424
<i>Waiting in the Everglades are hordes</i>

61
00:05:32,691 --> 00:05:35,932
<i>of county sheriffs, search parties
and ravenous reptiles.</i>

62
00:05:37,007 --> 00:05:40,481
<i>And at this corner wearing dark trunks,
the mighty Dexter.</i>

63
00:05:48,244 --> 00:05:49,380
Drive much ?

64
00:05:55,046 --> 00:05:56,492
<i>I need a miracle.</i>

65
00:06:05,027 --> 00:06:07,999
There's a switch...
right behind you on the wall.

66
00:06:12,275 --> 00:06:14,617
Damn, it's good to see another face.

67
00:06:15,054 --> 00:06:16,348
I never thought I would.

68
00:06:18,698 --> 00:06:20,457
I'm sergeant James Doakes,

69
00:06:20,641 --> 00:06:22,187
Miami Metro Homicide.

70
00:06:23,334 --> 00:06:26,039
- Who put you in there ?
- A fucking psycho.

71
00:06:26,898 --> 00:06:28,386
He could be back any minute.

72
00:06:30,715 --> 00:06:33,288
Grab that key right behind you
on the wall.

73
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,604
Who is he ?

74
00:06:35,285 --> 00:06:37,046
His name is Dexter Morgan.

75
00:06:38,709 --> 00:06:40,298
I need you to open this gate.

76
00:06:41,478 --> 00:06:43,093
Why would he put you in there ?

77
00:06:43,371 --> 00:06:45,812
Because I find out
he's the Bay Harbord Butcher !

78
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:48,186
Please, just open this fucking gate !

79
00:06:49,007 --> 00:06:50,743
He's the Butcher ?

80
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,446
That's I'm trying to tell you.

81
00:06:54,691 --> 00:06:55,730
What's in there ?

82
00:06:56,336 --> 00:06:58,336
Exactly what you think it is.

83
00:06:59,313 --> 00:07:00,525
It's evidence.

84
00:07:00,751 --> 00:07:02,295
And I saw what happened.

85
00:07:02,604 --> 00:07:04,573
I really need
to get out of this cage, lady.

86
00:07:06,872 --> 00:07:08,752
Poor thing, all alone.

87
00:07:10,422 --> 00:07:12,609
I'm okay. Just open the gate.

88
00:07:13,098 --> 00:07:14,102
Not you.

89
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:20,392
Hiding such an enormous secret.

90
00:07:21,194 --> 00:07:25,225
What a burden that's got to be.
No wonder he is so shut down.

91
00:07:26,715 --> 00:07:28,848
What are you, his accomplice ?

92
00:07:33,343 --> 00:07:34,778
I'm his soulmate.

93
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:55,632
You can't leave me in here like this.
You'll be an accessory.

94
00:07:55,814 --> 00:07:57,540
I'm not gonna leave you.

95
00:07:59,723 --> 00:08:00,827
Not like that.

96
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,304
What the fuck are you doing ?

97
00:08:05,537 --> 00:08:07,087
What the fuck are you doing ?

98
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,573
No ! Do you understand this is murder ?

99
00:08:12,001 --> 00:08:14,724
Open this sucking door !
This is a fucking murder !

100
00:09:21,793 --> 00:09:24,601
Hey. Dexter Morgan,
Miami Metro P.D. Forensics.

101
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:27,765
I'm here to join the search
for the Bay Harbor Butcher.

102
00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:31,383
The search is on hold right now
until they sort out the confusion.

103
00:09:31,579 --> 00:09:34,039
- Confusion, huh ?
- Yeah, it's a real mess.

104
00:09:34,881 --> 00:09:38,259
Take right at the fork.
Park outside the line of fire trucks.

105
00:09:40,335 --> 00:09:42,702
Confusion requires fire trucks ?

106
00:10:01,014 --> 00:10:05,191
<i>When something beyond reason happens,
it turns skeptics into believers.</i>

107
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:09,195
<i>Believers in a higher power.</i>

108
00:10:12,036 --> 00:10:14,181
<i>But what kind of power did this ?</i>

109
00:10:21,462 --> 00:10:23,438
You were fucking fast !
I just got here

110
00:10:23,703 --> 00:10:27,532
- and took a helicopter with Lundy.
- I broke a lot of speed limits.

111
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,606
After you left,
I realized you were right.

112
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:31,699
I didn't want to miss the action.

113
00:10:33,057 --> 00:10:34,278
What happened ?

114
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,086
They think a propane tank exploded.

115
00:10:38,531 --> 00:10:39,531
How ?

116
00:10:40,355 --> 00:10:42,610
Do I look like a fucking fire chief ?

117
00:10:45,874 --> 00:10:47,475
Did they find a body ?

118
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:50,663
Just bits and pieces so far.

119
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:58,150
<i>Was it spontaneous combustion ?</i>

120
00:10:59,047 --> 00:11:00,580
<i>Divine intervention ?</i>

121
00:11:01,423 --> 00:11:03,356
<i>If you believe that God makes miracle,</i>

122
00:11:03,533 --> 00:11:06,786
<i>you have to wonder
if Satan has a few up his sleeve.</i>

123
00:11:07,085 --> 00:11:11,445
<i>But when you don't believe in anything,
who do you thank at a time like this ?</i>

124
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:32,423
<i>We got a floater.</i>

125
00:12:08,721 --> 00:12:10,055
He got left off.

126
00:12:10,936 --> 00:12:11,963
Separation.

127
00:12:13,744 --> 00:12:15,008
Gaping areas of...

128
00:12:15,613 --> 00:12:17,030
putrefied tissue.

129
00:12:18,748 --> 00:12:20,715
Extensive fourth degree burns.

130
00:12:22,823 --> 00:12:24,633
Big ass fucking explosion.

131
00:12:26,043 --> 00:12:27,838
What else can you give us ?

132
00:12:29,647 --> 00:12:32,468
These linear lines around his eyes
are unburned.

133
00:12:32,628 --> 00:12:33,989
He was squinting.

134
00:12:34,384 --> 00:12:36,113
Alive when it happened.

135
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:38,057
What else ?

136
00:12:41,115 --> 00:12:44,667
Teeth are intact. Dental records
should give us a positive ID.

137
00:12:45,207 --> 00:12:47,060
Goddammit, Masuka. Is it Doakes ?

138
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:49,547
Male.

139
00:12:50,101 --> 00:12:53,218
African-American.
About the right length of torso.

140
00:12:55,002 --> 00:12:56,295
Heavily muscled.

141
00:12:58,792 --> 00:13:00,172
I think it's him.

142
00:13:05,378 --> 00:13:08,877
These are the same kind of tools
that scuba diving class found.

143
00:13:09,094 --> 00:13:11,600
He'd need them to make cuts
that clean.

144
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,047
Those come from the suspect ?

145
00:13:14,238 --> 00:13:16,413
No, they belong to a second body.

146
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:21,140
And whoever he was, he was dead
and dismembered before the explosion.

147
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:23,432
This is where the Butcher
did his dirty work.

148
00:13:23,606 --> 00:13:25,909
It's a perfect location
for a kill room.

149
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:29,534
- Doesn't get anymore remote than this.
- No, it couldn't.

150
00:13:29,824 --> 00:13:31,940
- This is good news, gentlemen.
- And lady.

151
00:13:33,471 --> 00:13:35,954
Right. All right, we keep the search on

152
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:39,192
until we get a firm ID
on that body in the water.

153
00:13:41,685 --> 00:13:42,746
You agree ?

154
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:46,559
The evidence is compelling.

155
00:13:47,196 --> 00:13:48,923
Overwhelming, actually.

156
00:13:52,111 --> 00:13:53,796
I guess we got our man.

157
00:13:54,702 --> 00:13:56,505
Shit, LaGuerta's here.

158
00:14:01,888 --> 00:14:04,450
- I woudn't if I were you.
- Is it James ?

159
00:14:08,198 --> 00:14:09,705
They don't know yet.

160
00:14:11,274 --> 00:14:13,565
<i>Apparently, miracles are subjective.</i>

161
00:14:14,063 --> 00:14:17,205
<i>I can't exactly feel LaGuerta's pain,
but I can appreciate it.</i>

162
00:14:17,659 --> 00:14:19,665
<i>Doakes wasn't so bad in the end.</i>

163
00:14:20,175 --> 00:14:23,794
<i>But the truly tragic thing would be
to let his sacrifice go to waste.</i>

164
00:14:24,713 --> 00:14:27,524
<i>There's only one way I can think of
to honor him.</i>

165
00:14:27,696 --> 00:14:29,678
<i>I have to embrace my freedom.</i>

166
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,072
<i>Sleep.</i>

167
00:14:43,446 --> 00:14:44,789
<i>What a concept.</i>

168
00:14:46,822 --> 00:14:49,530
<i>I can't believe I actually contemplated
turning myself in.</i>

169
00:14:54,095 --> 00:14:56,798
<i>This is so much better
than a prison cell.</i>

170
00:15:02,575 --> 00:15:04,821
<i>I can squeeze fresh orange juice.</i>

171
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:07,205
<i>Savour a fine French roast.</i>

172
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:13,702
<i>Grab a morning work out.</i>

173
00:15:15,077 --> 00:15:17,869
<i>OK, working out,
I could have done in prison, but still.</i>

174
00:15:20,151 --> 00:15:21,173
<i>I'm free.</i>

175
00:15:37,466 --> 00:15:38,466
Sorry.

176
00:15:39,073 --> 00:15:42,353
- Hope I didn't scare you.
- What are you doing out there ?

177
00:15:43,588 --> 00:15:47,353
I figured the kids were still sleeping,
I didn't want to ring the bell.

178
00:15:48,718 --> 00:15:50,084
Why are you here ?

179
00:15:51,737 --> 00:15:54,244
I figured the kids
were still asleep...

180
00:16:22,489 --> 00:16:25,121
I like when you sneak unexpected.

181
00:16:27,685 --> 00:16:30,514
Yeah, I wound up with some
unexpected time on my hands.

182
00:16:31,148 --> 00:16:32,970
<i>Like twenty years to life.</i>

183
00:16:35,346 --> 00:16:37,969
I don't know if this is a good idea.

184
00:16:39,368 --> 00:16:42,300
I was just getting used to you
from a distance.

185
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,814
I don't know,
you've been like a mirage.

186
00:16:48,623 --> 00:16:50,107
I've been right here.

187
00:16:51,433 --> 00:16:53,141
You're the one that run away.

188
00:16:54,886 --> 00:16:56,135
Yeah, I did.

189
00:16:58,043 --> 00:16:59,821
I kinda forgot who I was.

190
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:04,589
I got it straight now.

191
00:17:06,297 --> 00:17:07,681
Keep it straight.

192
00:17:08,115 --> 00:17:10,329
Or I won't be here next time.

193
00:17:11,054 --> 00:17:12,125
I know that.

194
00:17:15,129 --> 00:17:16,129
Mom ?

195
00:17:17,223 --> 00:17:18,727
It's the sex police.

196
00:17:22,288 --> 00:17:25,405
- How come you're still in bed ?
- I overslept.

197
00:17:25,695 --> 00:17:28,392
Will you make us pancakes, please ?

198
00:17:29,474 --> 00:17:30,883
What's under here ?

199
00:17:44,538 --> 00:17:46,440
Are you guys back together ?

200
00:17:47,927 --> 00:17:49,233
I guess we are.

201
00:18:15,399 --> 00:18:16,399
Over.

202
00:18:17,512 --> 00:18:18,988
Under. Over.

203
00:18:19,493 --> 00:18:20,493
Under.

204
00:18:20,942 --> 00:18:23,314
- Maybe I should do it myself.
- No, I wanna do it.

205
00:18:23,492 --> 00:18:26,617
- We're gonna be late.
- So what ? Case is closing.

206
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,578
We still need confirmation
on Doakes's body.

207
00:18:29,843 --> 00:18:31,127
And if it's him ?

208
00:18:31,659 --> 00:18:34,286
- Then, it's over.
- The case, not us, right ?

209
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:38,530
We still have the wrap-up to do:
cataloguing, confirming,

210
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:42,337
- filing, more filing...
- So we've got time ?

211
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:44,359
Plenty.

212
00:18:52,824 --> 00:18:55,646
- Time enough for a vacation ?
- Now you're talking.

213
00:18:55,945 --> 00:18:57,761
Toes in the sand, tequila.

214
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:01,065
Little tiny bikini.

215
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:03,976
How about a parka ?

216
00:19:05,253 --> 00:19:07,844
- A what ?
- I've had my feel of heat.

217
00:19:08,827 --> 00:19:11,283
No more heat.
You'd look great in a parka.

218
00:19:12,827 --> 00:19:14,332
Ever heard of Lake Ipperwash ?

219
00:19:16,454 --> 00:19:20,735
- Can't say that I have.
- Wonderful ice fishing. Very romantic.

220
00:19:21,862 --> 00:19:22,883
Fine. OK.

221
00:19:24,181 --> 00:19:25,421
Let's just go.

222
00:19:30,367 --> 00:19:31,799
- Morning, Dex.
- Donut ?

223
00:19:31,972 --> 00:19:34,648
I'm not really feeling like donuts
today. Know what I mean ?

224
00:19:40,621 --> 00:19:41,814
<i>Oh, right.</i>

225
00:19:45,294 --> 00:19:46,198
Donuts.

226
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:50,027
- Hey, are you free ?
- Vince, you have no idea.

227
00:19:50,187 --> 00:19:52,722
Good. I got a dozen boxes
of burned up shit from the cabin

228
00:19:52,882 --> 00:19:54,441
that need cataloguing.

229
00:20:03,475 --> 00:20:07,195
I was looking more closely at the date
of James' Special Forces missions,

230
00:20:07,355 --> 00:20:10,285
- and...
- We have a positive ID on the body.

231
00:20:10,906 --> 00:20:14,028
There may be an additional date
which puts him out of the country...

232
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,346
The burned victim is Sgt Doakes.

233
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,450
Dental records confirmed it.

234
00:20:26,213 --> 00:20:27,728
And the other body ?

235
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:33,130
Jose Garza, a murder fugitive who's been
living under the alias Chris Harlow.

236
00:20:34,115 --> 00:20:35,808
The body was dismembered.

237
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:38,204
Consistant with our other victims.

238
00:20:38,692 --> 00:20:41,400
Deputy director Adams
is closing the case.

239
00:20:42,711 --> 00:20:43,711
I see.

240
00:20:46,847 --> 00:20:50,767
All the evidence points to James Doakes
as the Bay Harbor Butcher.

241
00:20:51,687 --> 00:20:52,983
Conclusively.

242
00:20:56,278 --> 00:20:58,710
- I wanted you to hear it from me 1st.
- Thank you.

243
00:20:58,876 --> 00:21:00,638
I am truly sorry.

244
00:21:24,668 --> 00:21:28,283
Don't know why they keep hauling crap
from the cabin in here.

245
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,913
We already know
what we need to know.

246
00:21:31,467 --> 00:21:35,512
- Doakes was a suicidal maniac.
- The term is homicidal maniac.

247
00:21:35,977 --> 00:21:37,235
Not that I'm judging.

248
00:21:37,413 --> 00:21:40,531
Whatever. He blew himself up.
That's what I'm saying.

249
00:21:41,173 --> 00:21:44,076
I heard somebody saying
it was a propane accident.

250
00:21:44,318 --> 00:21:45,293
Right.

251
00:21:45,453 --> 00:21:48,083
Doakes accidentally turned on
the propane valve,

252
00:21:48,243 --> 00:21:50,166
and then the stove.

253
00:21:50,408 --> 00:21:51,798
The stove was on ?

254
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:55,617
It was in the official fire
investigators' report this morning.

255
00:21:57,033 --> 00:21:58,121
I mean...

256
00:21:58,308 --> 00:22:01,719
I guess it could be that Doakes didn't
realize fire and gas are a bad combo.

257
00:22:02,671 --> 00:22:04,764
But my money's on suicide.

258
00:22:05,104 --> 00:22:08,492
A bad ass like Doakes
would rather burn than get burned.

259
00:22:10,073 --> 00:22:12,075
It's a good line for my movie.

260
00:22:12,309 --> 00:22:15,441
- I better write it down.
- You're writing a movie about Doakes ?

261
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:16,882
Maybe or not.

262
00:22:17,042 --> 00:22:19,565
He'd rather burn than get burned...

263
00:22:46,185 --> 00:22:49,878
I checked and didn't see any GPS
device in the minivan, Dexter.

264
00:22:50,097 --> 00:22:53,145
<i>Did you check the glove box ?
It's grey, rectangular,</i>

265
00:22:53,387 --> 00:22:55,394
the size of a paperback book.

266
00:22:55,613 --> 00:22:57,107
<i>It wasn't there.</i>

267
00:22:57,349 --> 00:22:59,907
I even looked under the seats.
You think it was stolen ?

268
00:23:00,067 --> 00:23:01,067
<i>Maybe.</i>

269
00:23:01,475 --> 00:23:03,748
Thanks, Rita. I'll see you tonight.

270
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:07,755
<i>If someone stole my GPS,
it would've lead 'em straight to Doakes.</i>

271
00:23:08,076 --> 00:23:11,123
<i>Who do I know with a nasty habit
of stealing ?</i>

272
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,613
<i>My miracle worker.</i>

273
00:23:23,249 --> 00:23:25,169
It looks peaceful in there.

274
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:28,305
Doesn't it ?

275
00:23:31,149 --> 00:23:32,673
I'm glad you called.

276
00:23:33,902 --> 00:23:36,218
I was afraid maybe you'd left town.

277
00:23:38,203 --> 00:23:41,289
- Seems I found a good reason to stay.
- Like what ?

278
00:23:43,048 --> 00:23:44,260
A new victim ?

279
00:23:49,705 --> 00:23:50,927
You mean you ?

280
00:23:57,967 --> 00:24:00,174
That's why you asked me
to the aquarium ?

281
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:03,090
A public place.
You thought I was gonna...

282
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:06,510
That I would slit my needle
into your neck ?

283
00:24:07,021 --> 00:24:08,512
Is that how you do it ?

284
00:24:11,137 --> 00:24:12,725
It's one of the ways.

285
00:24:27,131 --> 00:24:29,519
You're afraid of me now,
aren't you ?

286
00:24:30,945 --> 00:24:33,183
Always been afraid of you, Dexter.

287
00:24:35,879 --> 00:24:36,665
Why ?

288
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:41,018
From the 1st time I saw you,
I could see how hopelessly consumed

289
00:24:41,178 --> 00:24:43,172
you were by your need.

290
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:49,219
You lied to me.

291
00:24:51,966 --> 00:24:54,296
All that time as my sponsor.

292
00:24:55,476 --> 00:24:59,021
You said all you wanted was
to help me control my addiction.

293
00:24:59,263 --> 00:25:02,909
- Would you control it ?
- That's not what you really wanted.

294
00:25:03,621 --> 00:25:04,621
Was it ?

295
00:25:07,992 --> 00:25:09,920
What do you think I wanted ?

296
00:25:11,437 --> 00:25:12,883
To know what it's like

297
00:25:13,494 --> 00:25:14,997
to feel something...

298
00:25:15,177 --> 00:25:16,296
that deeply.

299
00:25:19,029 --> 00:25:22,224
Anything. That's why you hang up
in recovery groups.

300
00:25:23,418 --> 00:25:25,072
You're emotionally color-blind.

301
00:25:25,428 --> 00:25:29,012
You use the right words,
you pantomime the right behavior,

302
00:25:29,293 --> 00:25:31,003
but feelings never come to pass.

303
00:25:33,075 --> 00:25:35,586
- It's not true.
- It is, Lila.

304
00:25:37,229 --> 00:25:40,127
You know the dictionary definition
of emotions,

305
00:25:40,952 --> 00:25:43,316
Longing, joy, sorrow...

306
00:25:44,102 --> 00:25:47,961
You have no idea of what any
of those things actually feel like.

307
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:50,428
You're wrong, I have feelings for you.

308
00:25:50,703 --> 00:25:52,359
You wanna have feelings for me,

309
00:25:52,628 --> 00:25:54,508
- they're just impulses.
- Enough.

310
00:25:54,668 --> 00:25:57,183
They're primitive responses
to immediat needs

311
00:25:57,363 --> 00:26:00,091
You know all the words
but you can't hear the music.

312
00:26:00,302 --> 00:26:01,644
Don't do this here.

313
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,904
I'm just like you.

314
00:26:29,553 --> 00:26:31,478
I was down to my last hope.

315
00:26:32,094 --> 00:26:33,174
So was I.

316
00:26:35,437 --> 00:26:37,507
When he told me who you are,

317
00:26:39,106 --> 00:26:41,887
I thought that was a secret
worth protecting.

318
00:26:42,051 --> 00:26:43,685
Most stuff in my mind.

319
00:26:43,938 --> 00:26:45,971
I wish you could have seen it.

320
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:48,532
The explosion was...

321
00:26:50,137 --> 00:26:51,137
brilliant.

322
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:54,140
I'm more like my father
than I've ever imagined.

323
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,734
I created a monster of my own.

324
00:26:58,523 --> 00:26:59,542
Told you.

325
00:27:01,882 --> 00:27:03,762
We're meant to be together.

326
00:27:07,536 --> 00:27:09,898
Lila, I'm sorry I pushed you away.

327
00:27:14,707 --> 00:27:17,568
I know how frightening
it must have been for you.

328
00:27:17,754 --> 00:27:19,687
Me scratching to get in.

329
00:27:20,678 --> 00:27:21,891
But it's okay.

330
00:27:22,248 --> 00:27:23,344
I'm in now.

331
00:27:24,182 --> 00:27:26,083
And I'm not going anywhere.

332
00:27:27,327 --> 00:27:28,075
I am.

333
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:33,315
And with Doakes gone, I'm starting
to think it's too dangerous for me here.

334
00:27:33,612 --> 00:27:35,690
I need to move on, to disappear,

335
00:27:35,922 --> 00:27:39,098
- I've already said my goodbyes.
- Let me come with you.

336
00:27:40,087 --> 00:27:41,826
I was hoping you'd say that.

337
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:46,569
How long would it take you
to get ready ?

338
00:27:48,008 --> 00:27:49,592
To close my accounts...

339
00:27:52,071 --> 00:27:53,709
Shut up my business...

340
00:27:56,338 --> 00:27:57,819
Tomorrow afternoon.

341
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:02,124
Go home and pack.
I'll call you tomorrow.

342
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:12,192
I can't wait to go away with you.

343
00:28:17,551 --> 00:28:18,753
I can't wait.

344
00:28:24,684 --> 00:28:26,990
<i>You're going away with me all right.</i>

345
00:28:28,203 --> 00:28:29,618
<i>In a garbage bag.</i>

346
00:28:33,281 --> 00:28:34,518
But it went all right ?

347
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:37,382
Sure, for an internal affairs
investigation.

348
00:28:37,554 --> 00:28:39,455
I spent 2 hours saying "No !"

349
00:28:39,716 --> 00:28:41,704
"I did not rape Lila Tournay.

350
00:28:41,941 --> 00:28:45,112
"She's bad shit, nuts, wacko".
I started to run out of adjectives.

351
00:28:45,288 --> 00:28:47,195
I've got a few you can use.

352
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:50,233
The good news is the department
is dying to drop the charge.

353
00:28:50,438 --> 00:28:53,076
They're dodging enough bullets
with this whole Doakes thing.

354
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,103
Good.

355
00:28:54,284 --> 00:28:57,956
When they find out your so-called victim
fled Miami, you'll be reinstated.

356
00:28:58,419 --> 00:29:00,955
- Lila went away ?
- She fucking better.

357
00:29:01,213 --> 00:29:05,233
Last night, I told her to haul her ass
out of town before she's deported.

358
00:29:05,937 --> 00:29:09,366
- You did that for me ?
- Of course. For you and for Dex.

359
00:29:11,139 --> 00:29:14,537
You 2 window lickers needed somebody
to snap you out of it.

360
00:29:16,812 --> 00:29:20,334
It's good to know somebody's pulling
for you when you're down.

361
00:29:21,303 --> 00:29:22,913
Okay, I get the point.

362
00:29:24,403 --> 00:29:27,328
- Are you sure Lila got the message ?
- Yeah, totally.

363
00:29:29,588 --> 00:29:31,242
I made it pretty clear.

364
00:29:32,983 --> 00:29:36,127
Excuse me.
Donations can be made directly to me.

365
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,929
- Donations ?
- For sergeant Doakes' memorial service.

366
00:29:41,374 --> 00:29:42,903
You got to be kidding.

367
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:45,562
That's what we do for a fellow officer.

368
00:29:48,307 --> 00:29:50,379
- Thanks again, Morgan.
- Yeah.

369
00:29:53,216 --> 00:29:55,542
Excuse me, lieutenant. I...

370
00:29:57,204 --> 00:30:00,210
- was wondering...
- Checks payable to cash.

371
00:30:00,834 --> 00:30:02,865
Actually, I wanted to offer
my support.

372
00:30:03,979 --> 00:30:05,525
some sympathy or...

373
00:30:06,278 --> 00:30:07,996
whatever.
If you wanna talk...

374
00:30:09,353 --> 00:30:11,416
Thank you, Morgan. I can manage.

375
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,043
I'm not so sure...

376
00:30:14,125 --> 00:30:16,213
You're collecting money
to honor a killer.

377
00:30:17,224 --> 00:30:20,217
I'm not honoring the Butcher.
I'm honoring James Doakes.

378
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,763
Respectfully, Maria, that's denial.

379
00:30:25,005 --> 00:30:27,770
- So it is.
- You're choosing to be in denial ?

380
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:29,476
Conscious denial.

381
00:30:31,056 --> 00:30:33,355
But the case is closed.
I won't pursue it.

382
00:30:35,049 --> 00:30:36,432
But I knew James.

383
00:30:37,089 --> 00:30:38,218
I knew him.

384
00:30:39,002 --> 00:30:40,988
As a partner and as a friend.

385
00:30:41,857 --> 00:30:45,547
And I have to keep on believing
that is who he was, because...

386
00:30:45,756 --> 00:30:48,547
If he could hide
all that over fucked up shit,

387
00:30:48,719 --> 00:30:52,124
- then I don't think I could ever...
- Trust anyone again.

388
00:30:53,636 --> 00:30:54,796
That's right.

389
00:30:57,399 --> 00:30:58,508
Or yourself ?

390
00:31:03,638 --> 00:31:05,797
I'll leave a check in your office.

391
00:31:13,666 --> 00:31:16,068
<i>It's strange to have a creation
out there.</i>

392
00:31:16,269 --> 00:31:18,699
<i>A deeply mutated version
of yourself,</i>

393
00:31:18,891 --> 00:31:21,373
<i>running loose
and screwing everything up.</i>

394
00:31:21,569 --> 00:31:23,822
<i>I wonder if this is
how parents feel.</i>

395
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:22,632
What the fuck ?

396
00:32:25,782 --> 00:32:28,845
- What're you doing here ?
- I came to make sure Lila left town.

397
00:32:29,896 --> 00:32:30,847
Me too.

398
00:32:31,552 --> 00:32:34,716
And if she was still here
you're gonna what ? Wrestle her ? Jesus !

399
00:32:36,047 --> 00:32:37,187
What have we here ?

400
00:32:40,557 --> 00:32:41,934
The door was open.

401
00:32:43,217 --> 00:32:46,446
I just stepped out to buy
some snacks for the road trip.

402
00:32:50,488 --> 00:32:52,019
Come to say goodbye.

403
00:32:53,987 --> 00:32:56,039
We came to see that you cleared out.

404
00:32:56,286 --> 00:32:58,813
Now we see you're on your way,

405
00:32:59,556 --> 00:33:01,018
we're good to go.

406
00:33:02,232 --> 00:33:04,068
Have a nice fucking life.

407
00:33:11,835 --> 00:33:14,474
- You're not coming with me, then.
- My God !

408
00:33:16,051 --> 00:33:19,271
What did you do to make her
so pathetically crazy for you ?

409
00:33:19,513 --> 00:33:21,151
Does your dick dance ?

410
00:33:31,952 --> 00:33:33,865
I better be on my way, then.

411
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:37,789
I think that's my bag.
I left it last time I was here.

412
00:33:38,031 --> 00:33:40,107
I'm pretty sure it's mine.

413
00:33:40,867 --> 00:33:43,378
I can open it up,
so you can check for yourself.

414
00:33:44,621 --> 00:33:46,147
No, it's my mistake.

415
00:33:56,657 --> 00:33:59,318
- Goodbye, then.
- Have a nice flight.

416
00:34:00,178 --> 00:34:01,833
Don't forget your broom.

417
00:34:07,041 --> 00:34:11,680
<i>Hello, this is Lila. Leave your name
and number. I'll ring you back asap.</i>

418
00:34:11,915 --> 00:34:14,803
Lila, where are you ?
I'm ready to hit the road.

419
00:34:15,025 --> 00:34:17,485
Hope you're not mad about that thing
with Deb. Had to lie.

420
00:34:17,663 --> 00:34:20,485
I don't want her to know
we're running off together.

421
00:34:20,772 --> 00:34:22,940
Call me right away. I miss you.

422
00:35:17,103 --> 00:35:18,103
Bedroom !

423
00:35:18,959 --> 00:35:23,246
What're we doing home in the middle
of the day ? She asked, hoping for sex.

424
00:35:27,147 --> 00:35:29,136
You're packing already !

425
00:35:31,485 --> 00:35:33,407
Good thing I got my touque.

426
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:36,701
- Lake Ipperwash or bust.
- Slow down.

427
00:35:36,865 --> 00:35:38,389
Wait ! I got a parka.

428
00:35:39,008 --> 00:35:42,174
Do you know how hard it is
to find a parka in Miami ?

429
00:35:42,584 --> 00:35:44,000
When do we leave ?

430
00:35:44,177 --> 00:35:45,862
Not "we". Me.

431
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:49,486
I just got a call from D.C.

432
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,716
A pattern of bodies was identified
in Oregon.

433
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:55,476
My flight leaves tonight, at 7:00.

434
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:57,929
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

435
00:35:58,171 --> 00:35:59,394
I wish I were.

436
00:36:01,996 --> 00:36:03,943
But it's too soon. I mean...

437
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:07,652
If you're leaving,
we gotta work out logistics.

438
00:36:07,816 --> 00:36:08,909
Logistics ?

439
00:36:09,244 --> 00:36:11,735
Yeah. We got a lot a shit
to figure out.

440
00:36:11,977 --> 00:36:15,913
Weekend visits and red eye flights
and frequent flyer plans.

441
00:36:16,713 --> 00:36:18,435
Let me get my calendar.

442
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:23,955
Do you honestly want
to go down this path ?

443
00:36:24,797 --> 00:36:28,668
You're right. I don't. Long distance
relationships never work out.

444
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:30,653
Not even in the movies.

445
00:36:32,605 --> 00:36:33,829
Fuck it !

446
00:36:36,074 --> 00:36:37,476
What're you doing ?

447
00:36:37,757 --> 00:36:38,783
Logistics.

448
00:36:40,978 --> 00:36:42,932
Taking in a leave of absence.

449
00:36:44,141 --> 00:36:46,136
You're not thinking this through.

450
00:36:46,299 --> 00:36:49,004
What's to think about ?
I'm going with you.

451
00:36:49,195 --> 00:36:50,562
It's just a job.

452
00:36:52,385 --> 00:36:53,860
It's more than that to you.

453
00:36:54,615 --> 00:36:56,148
Okay, I love my job.

454
00:36:56,453 --> 00:36:58,114
But not as much as I love...

455
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:02,557
being kin with you.

456
00:37:03,917 --> 00:37:04,917
Just...

457
00:37:05,814 --> 00:37:07,038
do me a favor.

458
00:37:08,208 --> 00:37:09,623
Take the afternoon

459
00:37:10,195 --> 00:37:11,777
and think about this.

460
00:37:15,204 --> 00:37:16,204
Fine.

461
00:37:17,664 --> 00:37:20,887
<i>You do me a favor and buy me
a goddam ticket on your flight.</i>

462
00:37:21,129 --> 00:37:24,015
I'm going home to pack
and I'll see you at the airport.

463
00:37:38,976 --> 00:37:40,341
That was delicious.

464
00:37:40,505 --> 00:37:43,410
What did you like better, the nature
stew or the mud pudding ?

465
00:37:43,652 --> 00:37:47,310
I want worms on toast.
Can we have worms on toast for a snack ?

466
00:37:48,964 --> 00:37:50,296
Go wash up asap.

467
00:37:50,795 --> 00:37:52,937
No running in the house, please !

468
00:38:04,103 --> 00:38:05,551
Yeah, real mature !

469
00:38:12,849 --> 00:38:14,855
Captain, you called for me ?

470
00:38:15,015 --> 00:38:16,142
Hey, Dexter.

471
00:38:16,363 --> 00:38:19,951
I received a phone call from a woman
saying she's a friend of yours.

472
00:38:20,176 --> 00:38:22,553
- Who ?
- She wouldn't give her name,

473
00:38:22,945 --> 00:38:25,535
but claims to have vital information
on the Butcher.

474
00:38:26,061 --> 00:38:28,455
- Any idea who she might be ?
- English accent ?

475
00:38:28,697 --> 00:38:30,513
- That's her.
- I think...

476
00:38:30,673 --> 00:38:34,377
she might have
a personal issue with me.

477
00:38:35,442 --> 00:38:38,423
It's the same woman that tried
to railroad Batista. Avoid her.

478
00:38:39,626 --> 00:38:40,681
Not a chance.

479
00:38:40,841 --> 00:38:43,511
Now this case is closing,
I can't afford any loose ends.

480
00:38:44,341 --> 00:38:46,723
- She said she was coming in ?
- Within the hour.

481
00:38:46,965 --> 00:38:49,601
- And she mentionned my name ?
- Specifically.

482
00:38:51,792 --> 00:38:54,063
Stick around.
We'll sort this thing out together.

483
00:38:56,441 --> 00:38:58,026
<i>If Lila plans to turn me in,</i>

484
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:01,490
<i>why drop my name to the captain
and give me a chance to intercept her ?</i>

485
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:03,264
<i>It doesn't make sense.</i>

486
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:08,163
<i>Unless she wants me here
so she can hurt me some other way.</i>

487
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:26,919
Guys ?

488
00:39:28,327 --> 00:39:29,140
Lexi.

489
00:39:32,177 --> 00:39:34,187
- Where're the kids ?
- I can't remember.

490
00:39:36,953 --> 00:39:38,983
I got your message. What's going on ?

491
00:39:39,225 --> 00:39:43,655
- The kids are missing.
- Sorry, I didn't mean to fall asleep.

492
00:39:43,897 --> 00:39:45,787
We have to call the police.

493
00:39:46,021 --> 00:39:48,661
Call Deb. She'll have the entire force
looking for them.

494
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:51,538
See if any neighbor saw anything.
I'll drive around the area.

495
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,592
I promise we'll find them.

496
00:39:54,985 --> 00:39:57,912
We're going to terminal 7,
Miami International.

497
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:03,466
- Morgan.
- It's Rita.

498
00:40:03,708 --> 00:40:07,095
- I'm getting in a cab.
- Cody and Astor are missing.

499
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:09,639
- You called the police ?
- Dex said to call you.

500
00:40:12,094 --> 00:40:13,963
Sit by the phone,
I'll take it from here.

501
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,311
All right.

502
00:40:16,662 --> 00:40:19,399
- Could you wait ?
- You don't wanna go to the airport ?

503
00:40:20,569 --> 00:40:22,026
Of course I do.

504
00:40:22,689 --> 00:40:24,153
I just said "wait".

505
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,990
For Christ sake, make up you mind.

506
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:28,980
Why ?

507
00:40:30,758 --> 00:40:32,916
Why do I have to make up my mind ?

508
00:40:36,478 --> 00:40:37,917
Goddammit !

509
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:39,940
Here.

510
00:40:46,221 --> 00:40:47,361
Hi, Dexter.

511
00:40:53,099 --> 00:40:54,726
- Hi, Dexter.
- Hey, Dex.

512
00:40:54,968 --> 00:40:58,313
- Hey, guys. Having fun ?
- Super fun. Lila's so nice.

513
00:40:58,785 --> 00:41:01,006
- Where is Lila ?
- I'm over here.

514
00:41:04,936 --> 00:41:06,529
Could've had it all, Dexter.

515
00:41:21,982 --> 00:41:23,713
Stay on the bed. Don't move !

516
00:41:38,854 --> 00:41:40,688
Look away, both of you.

517
00:41:48,093 --> 00:41:51,616
Astor, you first.
You're gonna help your brother.

518
00:42:06,307 --> 00:42:07,660
Go ! Run ! Find help !

519
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,467
- Come on !
- I can't fit.

520
00:42:12,503 --> 00:42:13,503
Shit.

521
00:42:56,431 --> 00:42:58,266
What do you remember from before ?

522
00:42:58,562 --> 00:43:00,174
Before we took you in.

523
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:05,832
<i>Nothing.</i>

524
00:43:06,813 --> 00:43:07,813
Good.

525
00:43:08,534 --> 00:43:10,968
Because what happened
was too strong.

526
00:43:11,891 --> 00:43:13,986
Son, it got into you too early.

527
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:18,628
<i>And it's gonna stay there.
It's gonna make you wanna kill.</i>

528
00:43:19,165 --> 00:43:21,164
And you won't be able to stop it.

529
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,363
<i>So I'm gonna be like this forever.</i>

530
00:44:20,789 --> 00:44:23,059
You gonna be okay. I got you.

531
00:44:55,379 --> 00:44:57,491
I'm so sorry about all of this.

532
00:44:57,946 --> 00:44:59,172
It's over now.

533
00:44:59,825 --> 00:45:01,646
They're safe. You're safe.

534
00:45:02,513 --> 00:45:03,850
It's all that matters.

535
00:45:13,499 --> 00:45:14,360
You two.

536
00:45:14,602 --> 00:45:17,864
Secure a perimeter and have
the fire chief come to see me.

537
00:45:18,795 --> 00:45:21,450
Put out an APB on Lila West,

538
00:45:21,692 --> 00:45:23,661
aka Lila Tournay, suspected arsonist.

539
00:45:23,903 --> 00:45:26,664
5'7", black hair,
pale like a fucking corpse.

540
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:28,499
Fucking corpse, got it.

541
00:45:29,587 --> 00:45:32,567
You're wasting your time.
She's not coming back. Not after this.

542
00:45:32,744 --> 00:45:35,415
- Yeah, I wouldn't bet on it.
- She won't.

543
00:45:35,762 --> 00:45:37,550
She's a survivalist.

544
00:45:38,265 --> 00:45:40,509
How'd you know the kids were here ?

545
00:45:40,714 --> 00:45:44,518
A neighbor saw them walking with
a strange woman. Wasn't much of a leap.

546
00:45:44,678 --> 00:45:47,059
Lila's gone after everyone
that's close to you.

547
00:45:49,456 --> 00:45:50,271
What ?

548
00:45:51,038 --> 00:45:54,901
Pretty impressive. Not too long ago,
I was taking care of you.

549
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:59,155
- I like it better this way.
- I can see that.

550
00:45:59,699 --> 00:46:02,033
Why's this man not on the way
to the hospital ?

551
00:46:02,671 --> 00:46:03,618
I'm fine.

552
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:05,953
No, your eyebrows are singed.

553
00:46:08,391 --> 00:46:10,082
How can you be so relaxed ?

554
00:46:12,761 --> 00:46:14,999
I'm good at compartmentalization.

555
00:46:16,856 --> 00:46:18,501
You're a little weird, Dex.

556
00:46:19,361 --> 00:46:22,553
That's not gonna change.
I'm gonna be this way forever.

557
00:46:24,746 --> 00:46:26,395
I can live with that.

558
00:46:29,021 --> 00:46:30,478
Just smarten up, OK ?

559
00:46:32,988 --> 00:46:36,147
<i>I passed through the flames
and rose from the ashes.</i>

560
00:46:36,352 --> 00:46:37,741
<i>Again.</i>

561
00:46:38,357 --> 00:46:41,363
<i>I've never put much weight
onto the idea of a higher power.</i>

562
00:46:41,523 --> 00:46:43,699
<i>But if I didn't know better,
I'd have to believe</i>

563
00:46:43,941 --> 00:46:47,389
<i>that some force out there wants me
to keep doing what I'm doing.</i>

564
00:47:53,751 --> 00:47:57,398
You wanted to be close to me.
This is the most I have to offer.

565
00:47:57,859 --> 00:47:59,400
I cannot feel my...

566
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:01,485
My legs and my body.

567
00:48:01,727 --> 00:48:05,041
Good. I chose a spinal epidural
instead of a tranquilizer.

568
00:48:05,201 --> 00:48:08,711
I've got a plane to catch.
And you don't need to feel this.

569
00:48:12,476 --> 00:48:14,381
You killed an innocent man.

570
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,209
I did it for you.

571
00:48:18,428 --> 00:48:20,421
You tried to kill the kids for me, too ?

572
00:48:23,874 --> 00:48:24,884
Don't do this.

573
00:48:26,206 --> 00:48:28,345
You told me to accept what I am.

574
00:48:31,299 --> 00:48:34,518
And to trust in the one thing
I know with absolute clarity.

575
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:45,933
Thank you.

576
00:49:05,444 --> 00:49:08,951
<i>Not long ago I had a dream that
people could see me for what I am.</i>

577
00:49:09,111 --> 00:49:13,628
<i>For a brief instant in time, the world
actually saw my bodies of work.</i>

578
00:49:13,788 --> 00:49:15,234
<i>Some even cheered.</i>

579
00:49:15,706 --> 00:49:18,617
<i>But as it turns out,
nobody mourns the wicked.</i>

580
00:49:19,333 --> 00:49:20,581
<i>Sorry, James.</i>

581
00:49:23,934 --> 00:49:27,780
<i>I think Harry knew that from the start.
That's why he gave me a code.</i>

582
00:49:28,022 --> 00:49:32,057
<i>It cost him his life, but it kept me
alive through incredible trials.</i>

583
00:49:32,359 --> 00:49:34,791
<i>The code is mine now,
and mine alone.</i>

584
00:49:35,188 --> 00:49:37,776
<i>So too are the relationships
I cultivate.</i>

585
00:49:44,554 --> 00:49:46,832
<i>They're not just disguises anymore.</i>

586
00:49:47,268 --> 00:49:48,402
<i>I need them.</i>

587
00:49:49,702 --> 00:49:51,833
<i>Even if they make me vulnerable.</i>

588
00:49:52,732 --> 00:49:56,339
<i>My father might not approve,
but I'm no longer his disciple.</i>

589
00:49:57,038 --> 00:49:58,465
<i>I'm a master now.</i>

590
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:01,844
<i>An idea transcended into life.</i>

591
00:50:07,261 --> 00:50:09,202
<i>And so this is my new path.</i>

592
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,576
<i>Which is a lot like the old one.</i>

593
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,195
<i>Only mine.</i>

594
00:50:14,819 --> 00:50:17,659
<i>To stay on that path,
I need to work harder.</i>

595
00:50:17,843 --> 00:50:20,324
<i>Explore new rituals, evolve.</i>

596
00:50:23,016 --> 00:50:24,270
<i>Am I evil ?</i>

597
00:50:25,246 --> 00:50:26,304
<i>Am I good ?</i>

598
00:50:26,613 --> 00:50:28,719
<i>I'm done asking those questions.</i>

599
00:50:28,992 --> 00:50:30,792
<i>I don't have the answers.</i>

600
00:50:32,432 --> 00:50:33,543
<i>Does anyone ?</i>
