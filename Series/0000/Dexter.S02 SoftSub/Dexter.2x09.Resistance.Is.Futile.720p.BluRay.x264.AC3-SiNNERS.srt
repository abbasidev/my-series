1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,778
<i>Previously on Dexter...</i>

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,282
- You'll notice we have some new faces.
- Are we under investigation ?

3
00:00:07,862 --> 00:00:10,134
Sloppy bloodwork. I asked myself,

4
00:00:10,462 --> 00:00:12,162
"how the hell did that happen ?"

5
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:16,415
Bay Harbor Butcher is one of our own.

6
00:00:16,893 --> 00:00:18,876
Dexter and I broke up.

7
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:21,838
Does that mean
he doesn't like us, either ?

8
00:00:22,265 --> 00:00:25,250
- Have dinner with me tomorrow night.
- I'd love to have dinner with you.

9
00:00:28,355 --> 00:00:30,806
Your past was a bigger mystery
than fucking Jimmy Hoffa.

10
00:00:31,066 --> 00:00:33,256
<i>It's time to make Doakes go away.</i>

11
00:00:40,952 --> 00:00:43,025
Sgt James Doakes
is on administrative leave

12
00:00:43,287 --> 00:00:45,152
pending an IA investigation.

13
00:00:45,415 --> 00:00:46,530
Are we through ?

14
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:49,295
- No, we're just getting...
- We're done.

15
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:53,035
There's my sponsor.

16
00:00:53,223 --> 00:00:54,453
<i>This woman sees me.</i>

17
00:00:54,647 --> 00:00:56,107
I didn't care what you did.

18
00:00:56,247 --> 00:00:58,807
<i>She's looking behind the mask,
and she's not turning away.</i>

19
00:00:58,951 --> 00:01:00,485
You a friend of Dexter's ?

20
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,129
I'm his decorator. Love the hat.

21
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,391
Help, please !

22
00:01:11,398 --> 00:01:14,467
<i>I need to embrace who I am. I need
to kill the man who murdered my mother.</i>

23
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:17,589
<i>A secret cabin
in the middle of the everglades,</i>

24
00:01:17,749 --> 00:01:20,707
<i>what more could
a rededicated serial killer ask for ?</i>

25
00:01:20,859 --> 00:01:23,225
It's kind of fitting, don't you think ?

26
00:01:33,838 --> 00:01:35,703
It's just that the door was open

27
00:01:35,965 --> 00:01:38,205
and you're the only other one
with a key.

28
00:01:38,467 --> 00:01:40,580
Get out of the house.
Call the police.

29
00:01:41,051 --> 00:01:42,885
I can't take you with me.

30
00:01:44,891 --> 00:01:46,422
Someone was in this house.

31
00:01:46,684 --> 00:01:48,934
- What's going on ?
- Please, just stay here.

32
00:01:49,093 --> 00:01:50,593
Stay away from Rita.

33
00:01:51,881 --> 00:01:53,319
Stay away from me.

34
00:03:50,859 --> 00:03:53,380
- That's what I said.
- That I'm always right ?

35
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:56,380
That you were right about Lila.
She was bad for me.

36
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,980
And that I'm always right !
Hurry the fuck up !

37
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,500
I didn't realize how bad
till last night.

38
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:05,020
Hey, Vince. How's it going ?

39
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,238
She had me fighting with myself
the whole time.

40
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:10,299
All that self-reflection is unhealthy.

41
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,334
Stop reflecting and move.

42
00:04:13,606 --> 00:04:14,606
Sorry.

43
00:04:15,397 --> 00:04:18,599
The fact is I already know who I am,
and I'm done fighting it.

44
00:04:19,494 --> 00:04:22,243
So the battle's over. Lila's over.

45
00:04:23,392 --> 00:04:26,351
Clean this mess up !
It's a goddamn safety hazard.

46
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:43,708
Can't leave this shit
lying around, bro.

47
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,129
<i>Nice: my subconscious
isn't even bothering with symbolism.</i>

48
00:04:55,149 --> 00:04:58,900
<i>That's what I get for leaving
the remains of Jimenez up in that cabin.</i>

49
00:04:59,051 --> 00:05:01,533
<i>Bad time to get sloppy,
with special agent Lundy</i>

50
00:05:01,673 --> 00:05:05,646
<i>putting everyone in law enforcement
under a microscope.</i>

51
00:05:09,194 --> 00:05:10,609
What are you doing here ?

52
00:05:17,147 --> 00:05:19,174
Just wanted to give you that.

53
00:05:21,715 --> 00:05:24,333
You're in the same clothes
as last night. You slept here ?

54
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,056
Not intentionally.

55
00:05:27,513 --> 00:05:29,636
I just wanted to make sure

56
00:05:30,114 --> 00:05:31,797
whoever broke in stayed away.

57
00:05:32,059 --> 00:05:34,467
I guess I kind of
fell asleep on the job.

58
00:05:35,762 --> 00:05:36,720
Sorry.

59
00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:38,305
Don't be.

60
00:05:43,403 --> 00:05:46,305
I made a killer robot
that eats airplanes. Want to see ?

61
00:05:46,455 --> 00:05:49,065
Mom's making pancakes.
You want bananas in yours ?

62
00:05:52,834 --> 00:05:56,072
Actually, guys, there's something
I got to go deal with, so...

63
00:05:56,264 --> 00:05:57,522
Then why'd you come ?

64
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,519
Cause you needed one of these.

65
00:06:09,378 --> 00:06:10,462
Alright, guys,

66
00:06:10,955 --> 00:06:14,173
Dexter's got work to do,
so go eat pancakes.

67
00:06:14,867 --> 00:06:16,634
Add extra bananas for me.

68
00:06:22,877 --> 00:06:25,050
I didn't mean for them
to find me here.

69
00:06:25,679 --> 00:06:29,231
Well, it's okay.
I think they needed a hug, too.

70
00:06:31,034 --> 00:06:34,473
- Take care, Dexter.
- Wait. I want to say something.

71
00:06:42,732 --> 00:06:43,828
I'm sorry.

72
00:06:45,828 --> 00:06:46,828
Alright.

73
00:06:47,218 --> 00:06:48,218
I feel...

74
00:06:51,854 --> 00:06:52,973
Such regret,

75
00:06:54,144 --> 00:06:56,641
which is rare for me.

76
00:06:57,923 --> 00:06:59,329
But not that I...

77
00:07:00,011 --> 00:07:01,645
don't mess up. I do...

78
00:07:03,681 --> 00:07:05,599
Just never so stupendously.

79
00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:08,082
I had you

80
00:07:08,849 --> 00:07:09,872
and them.

81
00:07:11,941 --> 00:07:13,074
And I had us

82
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,363
so much to have.

83
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,010
And I just...

84
00:07:20,876 --> 00:07:24,506
demolish it, I honestly thought
that I was smarter than that.

85
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,222
Rude awakening.

86
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:30,209
Lila's one of the biggest mistakes
of my life.

87
00:07:32,883 --> 00:07:34,904
It means a lot to me, Dexter.

88
00:07:37,853 --> 00:07:40,706
But it doesn't change the fact
that you slept with another woman.

89
00:07:41,981 --> 00:07:44,847
- I can't forgive that.
- I don't expect you to, I just...

90
00:07:45,601 --> 00:07:46,850
wanted to say it.

91
00:07:55,436 --> 00:07:58,580
<i>All I can do now
is pick up the pieces of Jimenez.</i>

92
00:07:58,823 --> 00:08:00,880
<i>He's one big pile of evidence.</i>

93
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,380
<i>Not that anyone will easily break
into that cabin. The thing's a bunker.</i>

94
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,704
<i>Still, I can't leave a kill
lying around.</i>

95
00:08:06,854 --> 00:08:09,054
<i>I'll have to call in sick at work.</i>

96
00:08:30,523 --> 00:08:32,850
<i>It's not Doakes -- FBI.</i>

97
00:08:33,004 --> 00:08:35,358
<i>My feeble interview with Lundy
might have put me</i>

98
00:08:35,508 --> 00:08:37,358
<i>on his short list of suspects.</i>

99
00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:39,850
<i>Left turn to the cabin...</i>

100
00:08:40,609 --> 00:08:42,799
<i>Right turn to a change of clothes
and work.</i>

101
00:08:45,964 --> 00:08:49,317
<i>Glad I'm at peace with Harry's code
again. It makes decisions easier.</i>

102
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,200
<i>Caution first, Jimenez later.</i>

103
00:09:04,246 --> 00:09:06,680
<i>Announcing the arrival of flight 274</i>

104
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:10,015
<i>From Santiago, dominican republic,
gate 20-B.</i>

105
00:09:10,276 --> 00:09:13,580
<i>Your call has been forwarded
to an automatic voice-message system.</i>

106
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,853
<i>James Doakes...</i>

107
00:09:15,115 --> 00:09:16,341
<i>Is not available.</i>

108
00:09:16,483 --> 00:09:19,178
<i>To page this person, press 5 now.</i>

109
00:09:22,665 --> 00:09:26,004
You know what ? fuck you, James.
Fuck you and your disappearing act.

110
00:09:26,145 --> 00:09:28,080
You didn't just stand me up last night.

111
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,755
You screwed yourself out
of a 6 figure security job,

112
00:09:30,897 --> 00:09:34,788
which means that being a cop
is one of the few options you have left.

113
00:09:35,214 --> 00:09:38,237
So, stop pissing off
the people that can help you.

114
00:09:39,701 --> 00:09:42,798
Lundy's people
have been trying to reach you.

115
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:46,150
They just want a hand
with the Bay Harbor Butcher case.

116
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,041
James, give it to them.

117
00:09:48,275 --> 00:09:50,602
Show Lundy that you are a team player.

118
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,020
Fake it.

119
00:09:53,949 --> 00:09:56,334
And pick up when I call again.

120
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,109
I'm gonna keep calling.

121
00:10:01,775 --> 00:10:03,870
I'm not giving up on you, James.

122
00:10:15,606 --> 00:10:18,240
Your right eye is a little darker
than your left eye.

123
00:10:21,135 --> 00:10:25,080
And you weigh about 50 pounds.
I'm gonna have to fatten you up.

124
00:10:25,451 --> 00:10:27,884
Didn't seem to bother you last night...

125
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,541
Or this morning.

126
00:10:31,912 --> 00:10:34,850
So much for taking it slow ?

127
00:10:35,671 --> 00:10:37,950
The slow part was nice.

128
00:10:38,502 --> 00:10:41,357
I guess that's the perk
of dating a man who's experienced.

129
00:10:41,619 --> 00:10:43,850
Read "old guy".

130
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,991
Read what I said --

131
00:10:46,131 --> 00:10:47,587
Experienced,

132
00:10:47,962 --> 00:10:49,746
as in technique...

133
00:10:50,593 --> 00:10:52,621
as in mad skills.

134
00:11:03,072 --> 00:11:06,420
Are you always gonna be this touchy
about the age thing ? That will get old.

135
00:11:06,706 --> 00:11:07,550
Sorry.

136
00:11:07,964 --> 00:11:11,470
This is new territory for me.
Dating in general.

137
00:11:12,345 --> 00:11:14,726
Dating someone so young in particular,

138
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,876
And dating a coworker especially.

139
00:11:19,274 --> 00:11:23,257
- So I'm the more experienced one, cool.
- You've dated coworkers ?

140
00:11:25,213 --> 00:11:26,818
Not that experienced.

141
00:11:29,017 --> 00:11:32,520
Well, I've seen enough of them
to see where they go wrong,

142
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,576
And experience tells me that

143
00:11:34,838 --> 00:11:37,079
full disclosure is the best way to go.

144
00:11:37,939 --> 00:11:39,138
What, like...

145
00:11:40,704 --> 00:11:42,158
Tell people at work ?

146
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,676
I'm an aboveboard kind of guy,

147
00:11:48,017 --> 00:11:50,259
And in the history of office romances,

148
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,512
sneaking around has never worked.

149
00:11:52,772 --> 00:11:54,003
I don't know.

150
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:58,475
Things are just so tense
around the station right now.

151
00:11:58,736 --> 00:12:00,961
So you're worried
about making people tense ?

152
00:12:01,101 --> 00:12:03,080
I just think the timing is bad.

153
00:12:03,702 --> 00:12:05,899
Maybe we should wait until we can...

154
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:17,986
When ?

155
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,370
Notify D.C.

156
00:12:21,802 --> 00:12:25,150
Then get Cal to go sit on Mendelsohn
until he signs.

157
00:12:26,923 --> 00:12:30,049
And then call the field office
and get me more bodies.

158
00:12:31,928 --> 00:12:34,124
Well, we need to move on this now.

159
00:12:39,153 --> 00:12:41,143
- What's up ?
- Not sure.

160
00:12:41,404 --> 00:12:43,513
Something break on the Butcher ?

161
00:12:43,781 --> 00:12:44,915
I gotta go.

162
00:12:45,987 --> 00:12:47,922
There's quiche. Eat it.

163
00:12:49,105 --> 00:12:52,266
Wait ! Shouldn't we finish talking
about this whole...

164
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,646
full-disclosure thing ?

165
00:13:04,565 --> 00:13:06,005
<i>Lundy's bees are buzzing.</i>

166
00:13:07,513 --> 00:13:09,830
<i>Something has agitated the hive.</i>

167
00:13:12,339 --> 00:13:14,943
My money's on Connolly
down in property.

168
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:17,915
Looks like much ado
about something in there.

169
00:13:18,065 --> 00:13:20,182
Lundy's got a suspect
for the Butcher,

170
00:13:20,444 --> 00:13:22,488
And bro, it's one of us here.

171
00:13:23,117 --> 00:13:24,117
That'...

172
00:13:26,282 --> 00:13:29,230
- disturbing.
- We're not sure Lundy picked someone,

173
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,600
but if he has,
it isn't one of my people.

174
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,007
Sorry but I confirmed it myself
last night.

175
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,963
It's someone in this house.

176
00:13:36,303 --> 00:13:38,072
- Who in this house ?
- I don't know,

177
00:13:38,212 --> 00:13:39,846
but something must've broke

178
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:43,120
cause Lundy shut us P.D. out
of the task force, brought more feds in.

179
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,532
So he definitely has someone
in his cross hairs.

180
00:13:47,471 --> 00:13:49,461
Why not Steinbauer in impound ?
He's a freak.

181
00:13:49,723 --> 00:13:51,505
I bet it's Wykoff from records.

182
00:13:51,767 --> 00:13:53,465
What about Loring in narcotics ?

183
00:13:53,727 --> 00:13:56,030
<i>Or it could be that murderous Morgan
in blood spatter.</i>

184
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,089
<i>Maybe I was being watched
this morning.</i>

185
00:13:58,229 --> 00:14:00,587
<i>But they'd do more than watching
if they had proof.</i>

186
00:14:00,865 --> 00:14:02,515
What's going on ?

187
00:14:03,124 --> 00:14:04,179
You tell us.

188
00:14:05,665 --> 00:14:07,844
- Why would I know ?
- You're Lundy's pet.

189
00:14:08,119 --> 00:14:09,552
- Fuck you !
- Seriously,

190
00:14:09,826 --> 00:14:11,635
what's he got,
or is he blowing smoke ?

191
00:14:11,828 --> 00:14:14,654
I don't know. But if he's got
something, it ain't smoke.

192
00:14:14,915 --> 00:14:16,560
He's too good to blow smoke.

193
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,716
Man, no wonder you're his pet.

194
00:14:19,002 --> 00:14:21,157
- Fuck you twice !
- OK, enough.

195
00:14:21,297 --> 00:14:24,616
If you're not on the task force,
you're clearing cases for the day.

196
00:14:25,167 --> 00:14:26,456
Yes, you too.

197
00:14:40,065 --> 00:14:42,731
- We've got company.
- Yeah, I noticed.

198
00:14:42,893 --> 00:14:43,990
Not there.

199
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,750
In there...

200
00:14:46,464 --> 00:14:47,817
Waiting for you.

201
00:14:48,341 --> 00:14:50,481
Lundy brought in
his own forensic techs.

202
00:14:51,616 --> 00:14:53,233
What are they looking for ?

203
00:14:53,495 --> 00:14:56,188
Think they'd tell me ?
I'm just the LFI.

204
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,149
Lead forensics investigator.

205
00:15:01,046 --> 00:15:03,804
Or at least I used to be.
Well, fuck them.

206
00:15:04,801 --> 00:15:08,184
They can have their fucking title
and the acronym that goes with it.

207
00:15:08,467 --> 00:15:09,876
Fucking Indian givers !

208
00:15:20,366 --> 00:15:21,340
In the flesh.

209
00:15:21,484 --> 00:15:24,136
I need your access code
for the forensics database.

210
00:15:24,276 --> 00:15:26,115
Walk me through your filing system.

211
00:15:26,255 --> 00:15:28,639
I'll need a breakdown
of procedure and protocol.

212
00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:30,746
Something particular
I can help you with ?

213
00:15:30,886 --> 00:15:33,315
We just need your help
navigating the lab.

214
00:15:33,671 --> 00:15:35,093
Your code, please.

215
00:15:36,797 --> 00:15:37,797
May I ?

216
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:50,724
<i>If they're looking for proof,
they won't find it. Not here at least.</i>

217
00:15:50,864 --> 00:15:52,965
<i>I may have briefly rebelled
against Harry,</i>

218
00:15:53,109 --> 00:15:54,853
<i>but I learned my lessons well.</i>

219
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,864
Come on, Dex. Tell me.

220
00:15:58,434 --> 00:15:59,956
Make sure they deserve it.

221
00:16:03,688 --> 00:16:06,197
This is life-or-death stuff.
It's that important.

222
00:16:06,337 --> 00:16:09,317
Why do you think I pulled
all those strings to arrange this ?

223
00:16:09,905 --> 00:16:11,933
Dexter, now, come on ! Tell me.

224
00:16:12,898 --> 00:16:14,731
What is the number-one rule ?

225
00:16:15,803 --> 00:16:18,969
- Don't get caught.
- And what are all the other rules for ?

226
00:16:19,157 --> 00:16:20,765
So I don't get caught.

227
00:16:22,971 --> 00:16:24,473
You ready for this ?

228
00:16:26,206 --> 00:16:27,234
I'm ready.

229
00:16:44,857 --> 00:16:47,227
Why are they looking at us like that ?

230
00:16:48,621 --> 00:16:50,603
They don't know why you're here,

231
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,591
why you need to see this.

232
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,922
But I want this seared into your mind, son.

233
00:17:13,285 --> 00:17:14,167
The chair ?

234
00:17:16,173 --> 00:17:17,289
The chair ?

235
00:17:35,905 --> 00:17:38,910
Cross-check our data with Interpol.
See where it leads. yeah.

236
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:46,438
So, bats out of hell move slower
than you did this morning.

237
00:17:46,578 --> 00:17:47,949
I know. I'm sorry.

238
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,980
- But as you can see...
- Something's up.

239
00:17:51,148 --> 00:17:52,455
Something's up.

240
00:17:53,855 --> 00:17:56,187
'Cause I wondered if maybe
you were also cheesed

241
00:17:56,363 --> 00:17:58,529
about my whole not-disclosing thing.

242
00:17:59,848 --> 00:18:02,580
I don't want you to think
I'm unsure or...

243
00:18:04,828 --> 00:18:06,368
embarrassed or anything.

244
00:18:06,645 --> 00:18:08,995
Why would you be embarrassed ? I'm hot.

245
00:18:10,341 --> 00:18:12,127
Yeah, you got that right.

246
00:18:12,917 --> 00:18:15,218
Look, it had nothing to do with you,

247
00:18:15,658 --> 00:18:18,918
except that it made you feel bad,
which wasn't my intention. It's just...

248
00:18:19,058 --> 00:18:21,067
- Something's up.
- Something's up.

249
00:18:21,228 --> 00:18:22,078
What ?

250
00:18:23,907 --> 00:18:26,271
- I really can't tell you.
- Why not ?

251
00:18:26,613 --> 00:18:27,521
Honestly,

252
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:31,187
you don't want to know.

253
00:19:07,586 --> 00:19:09,663
It's a ghost from my past.

254
00:19:10,499 --> 00:19:14,467
- I wasn't sure I'd be able to find you.
- I'm in the phone book now.

255
00:19:14,639 --> 00:19:16,247
Last place you look, hey ?

256
00:19:17,081 --> 00:19:19,031
It's good to see you, Leones.

257
00:19:19,233 --> 00:19:23,387
My father-in-law will be happy we have
a customer with American dollars.

258
00:19:23,886 --> 00:19:26,597
Looks like
you're in the travel business now ?

259
00:19:26,761 --> 00:19:28,510
Orbitz, man. It's killing us.

260
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:32,146
And people only think
of Haiti for war and poverty.

261
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,621
But the brave ones still come.

262
00:19:34,835 --> 00:19:36,951
We arrange tours between the islands.

263
00:19:37,095 --> 00:19:39,761
No more sneaking people
over the border at night ?

264
00:19:39,901 --> 00:19:42,034
My wife would castrate me.

265
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,413
I work only for her father now.

266
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,904
The man is satan on wheels.

267
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:49,255
I hope the dog will bite him.

268
00:19:53,142 --> 00:19:53,942
So,

269
00:19:54,822 --> 00:19:56,672
what can I arrange for you ?

270
00:19:56,812 --> 00:19:59,381
Maybe the rosewood resort
on little Dix ?

271
00:20:00,342 --> 00:20:02,527
Only the best for my old friend.

272
00:20:03,538 --> 00:20:07,696
I was thinking more like
the hospital in Dom. Rep.

273
00:20:09,566 --> 00:20:10,676
You are sick ?

274
00:20:12,767 --> 00:20:15,150
But I need a... discreet lab.

275
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:17,225
A relaxing cruise is better.

276
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:21,636
There's a shuffleboard tournament
On the Jewel of the Seas. Big stakes.

277
00:20:22,569 --> 00:20:24,312
you were always the one to see,

278
00:20:24,452 --> 00:20:27,045
no questions asked,
whenever we needed shit.

279
00:20:27,237 --> 00:20:29,020
I am not a fixer anymore,

280
00:20:29,768 --> 00:20:32,069
And you are not in black operations.

281
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,984
I'm a travel agent, and I like it.

282
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:39,981
No one tries to kill me
or torture me...

283
00:20:41,485 --> 00:20:45,144
except for him,
With his vicious dog and foul breath.

284
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:47,868
Listen, this isn't dangerous, man.

285
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:51,314
I just need some blood slides analyzed.

286
00:20:52,895 --> 00:20:56,015
- Leones, I need your help.
- This is all you want ?

287
00:20:56,835 --> 00:20:58,385
The slides analyzed ?

288
00:20:59,289 --> 00:21:02,061
And your most expensive
tour package of the islands.

289
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:06,513
Give me the slides.
I'll see what I can do.

290
00:21:06,689 --> 00:21:09,416
Confirm the arrangements first.
I'll bring them by boat.

291
00:21:09,556 --> 00:21:10,972
Avoiding customs.

292
00:21:11,112 --> 00:21:14,083
Don't want to risk it
with biological materials.

293
00:21:14,422 --> 00:21:16,164
Just tell me, James.

294
00:21:17,453 --> 00:21:18,784
Are you in trouble ?

295
00:21:21,504 --> 00:21:23,590
But someone else is gonna be.

296
00:21:26,394 --> 00:21:29,277
That takes us through
95's discoverable notes.

297
00:21:30,529 --> 00:21:31,583
Ninety four.

298
00:21:31,763 --> 00:21:33,755
How far back are you looking ?

299
00:21:33,974 --> 00:21:35,987
Let's start with knife wounds.

300
00:21:36,992 --> 00:21:39,704
To search by cause of death,
go to the upper right-hand...

301
00:21:39,848 --> 00:21:41,349
It's okay. I'm good.

302
00:21:44,078 --> 00:21:47,644
<i>They're wasting their time here.
If they had a warrant for my apartment,</i>

303
00:21:47,784 --> 00:21:49,920
<i>they'd find blood slides
and killing tools.</i>

304
00:21:50,182 --> 00:21:51,572
<i>Got to move those.</i>

305
00:21:52,088 --> 00:21:53,649
<i>Gotta dispose of Jimenez.</i>

306
00:21:53,825 --> 00:21:56,054
<i>Instead, I'm waiting
for the fat man to sing.</i>

307
00:21:56,198 --> 00:21:57,887
- Why don't I...
- I've got it.

308
00:21:58,027 --> 00:21:59,875
- It'll be faster...
- I've got it !

309
00:22:00,021 --> 00:22:02,067
I think we'll get along
on our own from here.

310
00:22:02,268 --> 00:22:03,689
<i>And he sings.</i>

311
00:22:10,567 --> 00:22:13,587
- I'm wearing green underpants.
- Are you ?

312
00:22:16,413 --> 00:22:18,464
But when he bought'em,
they were white.

313
00:22:18,604 --> 00:22:20,153
Too much information !

314
00:22:29,123 --> 00:22:30,941
Look who's come out of his cave.

315
00:22:32,412 --> 00:22:35,556
- Lila, what are you doing here ?
- She came to see me, bro.

316
00:22:35,696 --> 00:22:37,853
Angel mentioned he needed a decorator,

317
00:22:38,031 --> 00:22:41,534
and, well, a slot just came up,
so I gave him a call.

318
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:45,159
- I've always wanted a decorator.
- Come here.

319
00:22:46,927 --> 00:22:48,969
She's not really a decorator.

320
00:22:49,133 --> 00:22:52,260
It's not really my apartment
that I want decorated.

321
00:22:52,793 --> 00:22:56,392
So, hey, the boys here
have persuaded me to go for a drink.

322
00:22:56,569 --> 00:22:59,039
- Or 10.
- God. Should I be worried ?

323
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:01,133
Yes. you should.

324
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:05,049
Then maybe you should come with us,

325
00:23:05,329 --> 00:23:08,192
because who knows what secrets
will come pouring out of me

326
00:23:08,332 --> 00:23:10,283
once the drinks start flowing.

327
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:14,505
I have 2,000 square feet
that needs a total makeover.

328
00:23:14,645 --> 00:23:17,401
You got 800 if you count
your parking space.

329
00:23:17,551 --> 00:23:19,075
She can do it twice.

330
00:23:21,386 --> 00:23:24,762
<i>I have to get to Jimenez,
but a dead man tells no tales.</i>

331
00:23:24,912 --> 00:23:27,601
<i>A drunk, unstable woman
very well may.</i>

332
00:23:34,284 --> 00:23:35,750
but do you call me

333
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,674
Paddy the road builder ?

334
00:23:37,935 --> 00:23:41,050
No. And me, with my 2 hands,
I built the town library.

335
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:43,980
But do you call me
Paddy the library giver ?

336
00:23:45,774 --> 00:23:48,778
But you fuck one little goat...

337
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,299
- Alright. I got one.
- Stop.

338
00:23:53,894 --> 00:23:55,276
What ? It's a good one.

339
00:23:55,536 --> 00:23:57,893
Knowing you, it'd be inappropriate
in front of a lady.

340
00:23:58,058 --> 00:24:00,166
She just did a goat-fucker joke.

341
00:24:01,254 --> 00:24:03,375
You're such a protector, angel.

342
00:24:03,644 --> 00:24:04,811
I do my best.

343
00:24:05,258 --> 00:24:08,965
Like that time that you came
to Dexter's rescue at the bowling alley.

344
00:24:10,801 --> 00:24:15,128
You just ran right towards that mugger,
No thought for your own personal safety.

345
00:24:15,897 --> 00:24:17,631
- That's my job.
- Mine, too.

346
00:24:17,891 --> 00:24:18,924
It is not.

347
00:24:19,767 --> 00:24:22,427
<i>Don't do it, Lila.
Don't bring Jimenez up.</i>

348
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:25,428
Did they... ever catch that guy ?

349
00:24:25,915 --> 00:24:29,288
Yeah, Dex, did you ever file a report ?
I can still look into it.

350
00:24:29,428 --> 00:24:31,504
I'm sure he's long gone by now.

351
00:24:36,452 --> 00:24:38,538
Anyway, I'm gonna go to the loo.

352
00:24:39,912 --> 00:24:40,912
The loo ?

353
00:24:41,773 --> 00:24:43,211
How cute is that ?

354
00:24:43,707 --> 00:24:45,292
It's... right ?

355
00:24:54,522 --> 00:24:56,359
What the hell do you want ?

356
00:24:57,975 --> 00:24:59,158
I'm concerned.

357
00:25:00,195 --> 00:25:02,183
When someone quits their sponsor,

358
00:25:02,343 --> 00:25:05,395
- it means they're using again.
- Quit the sponsor bullshit.

359
00:25:05,535 --> 00:25:07,330
I'm done with it and you.

360
00:25:08,037 --> 00:25:10,475
Did I not make that clear last night ?

361
00:25:11,208 --> 00:25:12,594
It's out of order.

362
00:25:14,988 --> 00:25:19,261
- There's still work we can do together.
- No, there isn't. I am who I am,

363
00:25:19,536 --> 00:25:22,338
And I don't want you coming
anywhere near me or my addiction.

364
00:25:22,498 --> 00:25:25,150
- Do you understand ?
- Oh, I understand...

365
00:25:25,502 --> 00:25:26,906
how lonely you are.

366
00:25:28,337 --> 00:25:30,829
Those friends of yours,
they didn't even know you.

367
00:25:31,292 --> 00:25:34,030
They just see the mask,
but I see it all.

368
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:36,708
I can see how upset you are.

369
00:25:38,868 --> 00:25:39,838
No, really ?

370
00:25:43,114 --> 00:25:46,554
It's more than just me that's eating
at you. There's something else.

371
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,128
You don't have to handle it alone.

372
00:25:51,613 --> 00:25:52,668
I can help.

373
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:56,871
I know how heavy that mask is,

374
00:25:57,658 --> 00:25:58,941
how tiring.

375
00:25:59,201 --> 00:26:03,024
I'm the only one who can see behind it,
and it doesn't scare me.

376
00:26:04,153 --> 00:26:06,226
It's like looking in the mirror.

377
00:26:07,068 --> 00:26:09,000
It's why we belong together.

378
00:26:12,027 --> 00:26:14,519
Hey, asshole, it's ladies only.

379
00:26:16,262 --> 00:26:18,770
- My mistake.
- He giving you trouble ?

380
00:26:19,174 --> 00:26:20,296
A little.

381
00:26:21,723 --> 00:26:23,831
But I know he'll see I'm right.

382
00:26:24,841 --> 00:26:26,146
I know you will.

383
00:26:29,735 --> 00:26:31,219
You are not driving.

384
00:26:32,669 --> 00:26:33,675
Fuck you.

385
00:26:34,862 --> 00:26:35,867
Fine.

386
00:26:38,907 --> 00:26:41,411
<i>Can't live with her. Can't kill her.</i>

387
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:45,537
<i>She's not going away.</i>

388
00:26:48,264 --> 00:26:50,382
<i>Neither is that undercover car.</i>

389
00:26:52,664 --> 00:26:54,291
<i>So much for paranoia.</i>

390
00:26:56,166 --> 00:26:57,447
<i>Those feds are real.</i>

391
00:27:11,784 --> 00:27:13,433
<i>Lundy found my slides.</i>

392
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:17,632
<i>It's over.</i>

393
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:25,838
You're out of shampoo.

394
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:29,365
- Sorry. Yours is better than mine.
- What are you doing here ?

395
00:27:30,494 --> 00:27:34,244
My new place isn't ready. I don't wanna
make a habit of staying at Lundy's.

396
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,706
What if people find out ? It'd be
a new reason to disrespect me.

397
00:27:37,966 --> 00:27:40,584
They may already know.
They keep assuming I've inside intel.

398
00:27:40,844 --> 00:27:43,045
They're always asking me
what Lundy knows.

399
00:27:43,305 --> 00:27:44,912
What does he know ? Tell me.

400
00:27:45,052 --> 00:27:48,175
Fuck ! I'm talking about my feelings.
What the fuck is your problem ?

401
00:27:49,317 --> 00:27:52,775
I know he's old, and it's complicated
and whatever,

402
00:27:53,686 --> 00:27:55,724
but I feel like he's someone I can...

403
00:27:56,876 --> 00:27:57,935
count on.

404
00:27:58,195 --> 00:28:00,646
Good. You should have that,
'cause I won't always be...

405
00:28:02,739 --> 00:28:04,928
Who the fuck is that at this hour ?

406
00:28:07,164 --> 00:28:09,273
- Deb, don't.
- What the fuck ?

407
00:28:13,509 --> 00:28:15,954
Special agent Lundy wants to see you.

408
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,205
- Please come.
- Wait.

409
00:28:18,365 --> 00:28:20,618
Lundy didn't say anything
about this to me.

410
00:28:21,593 --> 00:28:22,793
I'm sorry, Deb.

411
00:28:23,103 --> 00:28:25,963
I'm on the fucking task force.
I demand to know what...

412
00:28:29,434 --> 00:28:32,803
I'm right behind you. They're calling
us in. I'm right behind you.

413
00:28:35,765 --> 00:28:36,895
We got him.

414
00:28:37,887 --> 00:28:39,481
<i>I should be panicked,</i>

415
00:28:39,923 --> 00:28:40,923
<i>terrified,</i>

416
00:28:41,239 --> 00:28:42,698
<i>but Lila was right.</i>

417
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,638
<i>The mask has been heavy.</i>

418
00:28:44,784 --> 00:28:47,641
<i>I won't need it in surrender.
I can let it go.</i>

419
00:28:48,584 --> 00:28:49,974
<i>The pain will come</i>

420
00:28:50,274 --> 00:28:53,294
<i>when Deb finally understands
who her brother really is.</i>

421
00:28:58,802 --> 00:29:01,325
<i>Rita's horror, the kids' tears.</i>

422
00:29:37,414 --> 00:29:39,479
<i>My old friends, here to betray me.</i>

423
00:29:40,942 --> 00:29:42,122
Please sit down.

424
00:29:46,018 --> 00:29:49,979
I'm sure you heard we have a suspect
in the Bay Harbor Butcher case.

425
00:29:51,267 --> 00:29:52,382
Put them on.

426
00:29:55,506 --> 00:29:57,983
We now have the evidence
to back it up.

427
00:29:58,865 --> 00:30:00,207
We need answers,

428
00:30:01,315 --> 00:30:02,115
now.

429
00:30:05,499 --> 00:30:06,499
Open it.

430
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,218
Explain it to us.

431
00:30:29,831 --> 00:30:30,838
Trophies.

432
00:30:32,346 --> 00:30:33,900
That's what I thought.

433
00:30:36,438 --> 00:30:37,845
What happens now ?

434
00:30:38,351 --> 00:30:41,294
I know this will come
as a shock to you, Morgan,

435
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,935
but our primary suspect
is someone you know well...

436
00:30:47,939 --> 00:30:49,494
Sgt James Doakes.

437
00:30:55,624 --> 00:30:58,536
He was the lead case investigator
on 4 of the Butcher victims,

438
00:30:58,676 --> 00:31:00,424
which put him on my radar.

439
00:31:02,587 --> 00:31:05,747
We looked into his background.
It turns out his father was a butcher

440
00:31:06,135 --> 00:31:10,155
and abusive. Doakes was also
a trained assassin in special forces.

441
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:14,506
That along with his on-the-job shootings
and excessive-force citations...

442
00:31:14,766 --> 00:31:16,794
- He fits the profile.
- Yes.

443
00:31:18,106 --> 00:31:21,138
He has a need to dole out
personal justice.

444
00:31:21,551 --> 00:31:24,306
Yesterday, Doakes walked out
of an interview and disappeared.

445
00:31:24,451 --> 00:31:27,561
This morning, we were alerted
he boarded a plane out of the country.

446
00:31:28,048 --> 00:31:30,713
That enabled me to get warrants
on his apartment and car.

447
00:31:33,881 --> 00:31:35,318
He had the slides ?

448
00:31:35,508 --> 00:31:38,048
Carefully hidden in the trunk
of his car at the airport.

449
00:31:39,213 --> 00:31:40,908
It all makes so much sense.

450
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:45,172
Everyone else in the precinct was
beyond shocked when I told them.

451
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:50,083
What exactly is Sergeant Doakes'
problem with you, Morgan ?

452
00:31:50,978 --> 00:31:52,535
<i>I kill people, for one.</i>

453
00:31:52,675 --> 00:31:55,557
<i>But what was it Sergeant Doakes
said about me ?</i>

454
00:31:56,012 --> 00:31:58,651
I've always sensed
there was something...

455
00:31:59,029 --> 00:32:00,866
off about him...

456
00:32:03,011 --> 00:32:05,088
Like he's hiding in plain sight.

457
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:10,854
- I never concealed my doubts.
- So he attacked you.

458
00:32:11,218 --> 00:32:13,150
Well, he might try it again.

459
00:32:13,391 --> 00:32:16,234
Particularly when he finds out
he's our prime suspect.

460
00:32:17,331 --> 00:32:19,112
Yeah. That should piss him off.

461
00:32:19,293 --> 00:32:21,609
We've tried to keep an eye on you
from a distance.

462
00:32:21,791 --> 00:32:24,910
- The undercover cars.
- Not undercover enough, obviously.

463
00:32:26,608 --> 00:32:28,830
I'm sorry for the abrupt pickup tonight,

464
00:32:29,242 --> 00:32:32,693
but from here on out, we'll want
a protective detail on you at all times.

465
00:32:32,851 --> 00:32:35,059
That could complicate my life.

466
00:32:35,199 --> 00:32:37,881
Dexter, it will keep Doakes at bay.

467
00:32:38,524 --> 00:32:40,884
- Good point.
- What happens now is we need you

468
00:32:41,144 --> 00:32:43,845
to analyze and match these slides
immediately.

469
00:32:44,229 --> 00:32:46,932
- Me ?
- I'm keeping the forensics in-house.

470
00:32:47,192 --> 00:32:49,726
The public needs
to see our strength now.

471
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,688
Their trust in us is about
to take a major ass-fucking.

472
00:32:54,758 --> 00:32:56,356
I make you 1st forensic tech

473
00:32:56,596 --> 00:32:58,693
in the chain of custody
with these slides.

474
00:32:59,147 --> 00:33:02,864
I figure you have more motivation than
most to see Doakes brought to justice.

475
00:33:03,124 --> 00:33:04,783
So I know you'll be thorough.

476
00:33:12,245 --> 00:33:15,042
The TSA is circulating Doakes's photo
to all major airports.

477
00:33:16,037 --> 00:33:17,288
<i>Sergeant Doakes...</i>

478
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:20,295
<i>He peeked behind the curtain.
He saw who I am.</i>

479
00:33:20,455 --> 00:33:22,660
<i>But it only put him in the line of fire.</i>

480
00:33:22,803 --> 00:33:25,176
There's an APB out
on the eastern seaboard.

481
00:33:25,316 --> 00:33:27,587
- I still don't believe it.
- 'Cause it's not true.

482
00:33:27,732 --> 00:33:30,335
- I don't know...
- Don't, Vince.

483
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,643
Just don't.

484
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,313
I didn't know.

485
00:33:41,957 --> 00:33:43,965
I swear Lundy didn't tell me.

486
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,199
I believe you.

487
00:33:46,387 --> 00:33:48,993
Big fucking manhunt mobilizing
out there.

488
00:33:49,851 --> 00:33:51,121
We'll get him, Dex.

489
00:33:51,391 --> 00:33:53,961
<i>And when you do, my story
has to be stronger than his.</i>

490
00:33:54,105 --> 00:33:58,170
Don't worry, I'll be with you every step
of the way. Me and this.

491
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:01,590
- I have an even bigger favor.
- Name it.

492
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:04,289
Move into that new apartment of yours.

493
00:34:04,555 --> 00:34:06,949
If you got in the middle of this
and you got hurt...

494
00:34:07,093 --> 00:34:07,972
Hurt ?

495
00:34:08,656 --> 00:34:09,806
I'm a fucking cop.

496
00:34:10,066 --> 00:34:13,101
You're my sister, and I'm gonna
worry like a brother, not a coworker.

497
00:34:13,361 --> 00:34:16,767
- Don't. You have enough to worry about.
- I can't help it.

498
00:34:17,595 --> 00:34:19,471
The best thing you can do for me

499
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:22,194
is to get me and my protective detail
a wide berth.

500
00:34:24,512 --> 00:34:25,655
Fucker.

501
00:34:28,506 --> 00:34:29,326
Fine.

502
00:34:30,766 --> 00:34:32,827
I fucking hate it, but I get it.

503
00:34:37,572 --> 00:34:40,001
<i>One less pair of eyes to worry about.</i>

504
00:34:46,061 --> 00:34:48,491
You just can't get rid of me, can you ?

505
00:34:53,126 --> 00:34:54,168
LaGuerta.

506
00:34:54,762 --> 00:34:56,513
<i>You know I didn't do this.</i>

507
00:34:56,815 --> 00:34:58,730
You know me, Maria. That's not me.

508
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,185
Yeah, but they don't.

509
00:35:03,319 --> 00:35:06,650
- What do they have on me ?
- They found something in your car.

510
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:08,031
Oh, shit.

511
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,159
The longer you stay out,
the worse it gets

512
00:35:11,456 --> 00:35:14,405
<i>The only way I can help you
is if you turn yourself in.</i>

513
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:17,489
- No one will listen without proof.
- Of what ?

514
00:35:17,801 --> 00:35:20,150
I don't want to pull you into this.

515
00:35:21,475 --> 00:35:23,517
The next time you see me,
they'll be no doubt.

516
00:35:23,681 --> 00:35:25,822
<i>Until then, you won't be able
to contact me.</i>

517
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:27,452
Don't you disappear on me.

518
00:35:27,995 --> 00:35:30,540
- Maria, I have to do this.
- God damn !

519
00:35:32,467 --> 00:35:33,653
<i>Listen to me.</i>

520
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:37,966
I want you to know that you meant
a lot to me, more than you know, and...

521
00:35:39,614 --> 00:35:41,634
I just want to thank you for that.

522
00:35:43,515 --> 00:35:44,985
What does that mean ?

523
00:35:49,573 --> 00:35:50,552
Wait !

524
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,017
<i>Looks like I won't find any prints
or DNA on this box.</i>

525
00:36:20,402 --> 00:36:23,149
<i>I can chalk it up to how careful Doakes is.</i>

526
00:36:23,617 --> 00:36:26,778
<i>Harry had strict rules
about not hurting the innocent,</i>

527
00:36:27,002 --> 00:36:28,670
<i>and for all his fury...</i>

528
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:31,279
<i>Doakes is innocent.</i>

529
00:36:32,598 --> 00:36:35,357
<i>But there's also the n°1 rule:
don't get caught.</i>

530
00:36:38,854 --> 00:36:42,194
<i>Still, he'll fight this,
and I'll have to disprove him.</i>

531
00:36:46,097 --> 00:36:47,170
<i>He could win...</i>

532
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:50,915
<i>Or he could end up
paying for my crimes.</i>

533
00:37:18,546 --> 00:37:19,435
Morning.

534
00:37:21,303 --> 00:37:22,324
Mr. Morgan ?

535
00:37:22,888 --> 00:37:25,958
Special agent Lundy
thought you might need our help.

536
00:37:26,388 --> 00:37:27,679
Please come in.

537
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:31,710
Sorry about all the secrecy yesterday.

538
00:37:31,981 --> 00:37:35,938
We were reviewing sergeant Doakes'cases,
and, well, you understand.

539
00:37:37,155 --> 00:37:38,385
I need you to do

540
00:37:38,567 --> 00:37:41,665
the liquid extractions
and centrifuging on these samples.

541
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:45,414
- The cells just started digesting.
- Then we'll come back in 12 h.

542
00:37:45,574 --> 00:37:47,720
The samples should be watched
at all times.

543
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,849
Don't let anyone in or out of the lab,

544
00:37:50,009 --> 00:37:52,597
and don't let the incubator
dip below 37°.

545
00:37:52,757 --> 00:37:54,966
And please, don't touch anything.

546
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,599
You understand.

547
00:38:01,075 --> 00:38:02,545
<i>That was satisfying.</i>

548
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:20,418
Are you okay, man ?
This shit with Doakes is crazy.

549
00:38:20,714 --> 00:38:22,630
- Yeah. I have to go.
- Hold on.

550
00:38:23,772 --> 00:38:26,559
Are you pissed or something
about Lila and me ?

551
00:38:26,946 --> 00:38:29,903
- Oh, yeah. That.
- I don't want it getting between us.

552
00:38:30,102 --> 00:38:33,729
- If you still want her...
- God, no. Lila's insane, destructive.

553
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:35,731
A naturally occurring disaster.

554
00:38:36,028 --> 00:38:38,932
- So you don't mind if I go for her.
- What ? No.

555
00:38:39,156 --> 00:38:41,317
Look, Angel, here's the real truth.

556
00:38:42,189 --> 00:38:44,155
Lila's just using you to get at me.

557
00:38:45,334 --> 00:38:47,230
- So what ?
- "So what" ?

558
00:38:47,374 --> 00:38:51,257
No one's used me for good or bad reasons
since my wife divorced me.

559
00:38:51,416 --> 00:38:53,201
Damn sure no one as hot as Lila.

560
00:38:53,486 --> 00:38:56,982
- You may be missing my point.
- Look, first it was the divorce,

561
00:38:57,287 --> 00:39:01,171
then getting stabbed was no picnic.
And now this thing with Doakes ?

562
00:39:02,018 --> 00:39:04,799
Dark days, my friend, too dark.

563
00:39:05,361 --> 00:39:07,980
Man, I need a light
at the end of the tunnel,

564
00:39:08,215 --> 00:39:10,612
and Lila's it, alright ?

565
00:39:12,494 --> 00:39:13,736
Alright, then.

566
00:39:14,248 --> 00:39:17,147
<i>Angel just doesn't get it.
Lila's no solution.</i>

567
00:39:17,307 --> 00:39:18,681
<i>She's a problem...</i>

568
00:39:20,747 --> 00:39:21,754
Shall we ?

569
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:26,442
<i>just like my little groupies.</i>

570
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,674
- I couldn't tell you.
- Even with my brother at risk ?

571
00:39:38,818 --> 00:39:40,089
We had him covered.

572
00:39:40,373 --> 00:39:42,805
It would've forced you to divide
your loyalties,

573
00:39:42,945 --> 00:39:45,181
plus, I didn't want to appear
to favor you.

574
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:48,851
- They all think you favor me anyway.
- Maybe because I do.

575
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:51,968
- You think they know ?
- Not until you tell them.

576
00:39:52,241 --> 00:39:53,834
Special agent Lundy ?

577
00:39:54,894 --> 00:39:57,785
- You give Doakes to the press ?
- Best way to bring him in.

578
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:01,950
- If you publicly accuse him...
- I'm not accusing anyone.

579
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:05,392
Doakes is wanted for questioning,
that's what my press release says.

580
00:40:05,532 --> 00:40:06,968
It'll still destroy him.

581
00:40:07,108 --> 00:40:09,450
He's doing a fine job
of destroying himself.

582
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:13,100
- He's not your man.
- He is, however, my prime suspect.

583
00:40:14,854 --> 00:40:15,854
Look.

584
00:40:17,369 --> 00:40:19,781
I'm willing to work with you on this,

585
00:40:19,941 --> 00:40:22,445
but only if you let me take lead
with the media.

586
00:40:22,732 --> 00:40:25,550
Lieutenant, I am not letting you
anywhere near the media.

587
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:28,821
He may be your ex-partner,
he may be your best friend.

588
00:40:29,141 --> 00:40:31,118
What he is to me is a suspect.

589
00:40:31,909 --> 00:40:34,250
So you deal with that
however you need to.

590
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:37,120
and you will give me
your complete cooperation,

591
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:39,631
or you may find yourself out of a job.

592
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,752
It's mine.

593
00:40:58,471 --> 00:40:59,618
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

594
00:41:00,486 --> 00:41:03,843
- I wasn't sure I should call.
- I'm glad you did.

595
00:41:05,417 --> 00:41:09,088
It's probably best I move on,
but the kids were so happy to see you

596
00:41:09,361 --> 00:41:10,893
<i>yesterday, and I wasn't...</i>

597
00:41:11,367 --> 00:41:13,500
you know, unhappy.

598
00:41:14,073 --> 00:41:15,839
Well, that's good, right ?

599
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,725
<i>I just... I need to know one thing.</i>

600
00:41:21,186 --> 00:41:23,087
Is it over with Lila ?

601
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:26,709
Yes, absolutely, completely over.

602
00:41:26,849 --> 00:41:29,031
If I never see her again,
it'll be too soon.

603
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,342
I have feelings for you.

604
00:41:44,249 --> 00:41:46,181
I have feelings for you, too.

605
00:41:47,652 --> 00:41:49,680
I'm not gonna fight them anymore.

606
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:53,211
I think we should get together and talk.

607
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:54,266
Tonight ?

608
00:41:57,399 --> 00:42:00,358
That would be great, really great,
but tonight's...

609
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,403
No, this... is a bad idea.

610
00:42:03,374 --> 00:42:06,155
<i>No, Rita, it's the best idea
you've ever had.</i>

611
00:42:06,465 --> 00:42:09,620
But we've got a big break
in the Bay Harbor Butcher case.

612
00:42:10,553 --> 00:42:13,551
- Things are kinda intense around here.
- Did they catch him ?

613
00:42:14,843 --> 00:42:16,984
Someone's gonna go down for it.

614
00:42:17,849 --> 00:42:20,246
But tomorrow would be really great.

615
00:42:23,099 --> 00:42:25,495
- Tomorrow.
- I'll look forward to it.

616
00:42:33,615 --> 00:42:35,709
We're getting together tomorrow.

617
00:42:37,807 --> 00:42:39,533
Communication's the key.

618
00:42:45,022 --> 00:42:47,278
<i>The light at the end of the tunnel.</i>

619
00:43:01,507 --> 00:43:02,412
All clear.

620
00:43:03,412 --> 00:43:07,007
We'll have a man stationed at the front
and side doors and 2 in the parking lot.

621
00:43:07,162 --> 00:43:09,837
Just give us a yell if anything arises.

622
00:43:10,568 --> 00:43:13,633
Nothing's gonna arise, certainly not me,
not until tomorrow morning.

623
00:43:13,948 --> 00:43:15,146
I'm exhausted.

624
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:18,415
Don't let anyone near this door
for any reason.

625
00:43:18,555 --> 00:43:20,020
Shoot them if you have to.

626
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,903
No problem. Sleep tight.

627
00:43:26,188 --> 00:43:27,706
<i>Sleep would be nice,</i>

628
00:43:28,297 --> 00:43:30,199
<i>but there's too much to do.</i>

629
00:43:31,808 --> 00:43:35,019
<i>The good news is my new friends
will keep Doakes away.</i>

630
00:43:35,159 --> 00:43:38,396
<i>The bad news is they make
getting to Jimenez difficult...</i>

631
00:43:40,221 --> 00:43:41,707
<i>But not impossible.</i>

632
00:43:43,074 --> 00:43:46,623
<i>Fortunately, a car isn't the only way
to reach the Everglades,</i>

633
00:43:46,893 --> 00:43:49,494
<i>and my new marina's
only a 20-minute walk.</i>

634
00:43:56,507 --> 00:43:58,217
<i>I'm on my way, Jimenez.</i>

635
00:43:59,318 --> 00:44:01,091
<i>Don't decompose just yet.</i>

636
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:17,024
<i>I'll be against the current
on the way back.</i>

637
00:44:17,164 --> 00:44:20,157
<i>With bagging, cleanup,
and detour to the Gulf Stream,</i>

638
00:44:20,644 --> 00:44:23,152
<i>tight, but I should be home
by daybreak.</i>

639
00:44:28,397 --> 00:44:31,273
It's time to get you out of my life
once and for all.

640
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,496
- You gotta talk to Lundy.
- About what ?

641
00:44:36,826 --> 00:44:39,473
Get him to hold off
on putting Doakes on the news.

642
00:44:39,613 --> 00:44:41,323
Maybe you should talk to Lundy.

643
00:44:41,488 --> 00:44:44,604
You're one of us.
Doakes is one of us.

644
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:47,556
- He deserves the benefit of the doubt.
- Look,

645
00:44:47,732 --> 00:44:50,428
Lieutenant, I know he's your friend,

646
00:44:51,268 --> 00:44:53,585
and we're all
pretty fucked up about this,

647
00:44:53,728 --> 00:44:56,658
- but it is Lundy's ballgame.
- But he listens to you.

648
00:44:57,183 --> 00:45:00,571
- You're his right hand.
- Right hand ? Just say it.

649
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:03,719
Fuck the euphemisms.
And OK, I may be sleeping with him,

650
00:45:04,014 --> 00:45:05,890
but it doesn't mean he tells me shit

651
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:08,411
or listens to me about anything,
so stop asking !

652
00:45:08,551 --> 00:45:10,420
You're sleeping with Lundy ?

653
00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:17,688
I'm sleeping at your place again
tonight.

654
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,325
<i>Just one more trip.</i>

655
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,859
<i>Ahead of schedule.</i>

656
00:45:47,744 --> 00:45:50,140
That's right, motherfucker ! It's over.

657
00:45:58,433 --> 00:45:59,744
How'd you find me ?

658
00:46:00,081 --> 00:46:01,766
GPS tap on your boat.

659
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:03,990
Jesus Christ, Morgan.

660
00:46:04,245 --> 00:46:06,833
Jesus fucking Christ !
You're the Bay Harbor Butcher !

661
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:09,889
- I really hate that name.
- Jesus christ, man.

662
00:46:10,213 --> 00:46:13,179
- You said that.
- I knew there was something with you.

663
00:46:13,639 --> 00:46:14,886
But this shit ?

664
00:46:15,134 --> 00:46:17,212
What can I say ?
You were right about me.

665
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:21,427
I never held it against you.
I don't now.

666
00:46:22,414 --> 00:46:25,162
My buddies thought I was crazy
for becoming a cop.

667
00:46:25,332 --> 00:46:27,696
I had skills.
I could have written my own ticket.

668
00:46:28,033 --> 00:46:31,606
And lately, I thought they might
have been right, but this...

669
00:46:31,798 --> 00:46:33,504
This makes it all worth it.

670
00:46:34,793 --> 00:46:37,203
- I'm happy for you.
- Shut the fuck up.

671
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:39,400
Let's get this over with.

672
00:46:41,592 --> 00:46:42,710
Put them on.

673
00:46:45,286 --> 00:46:47,427
Morgan, you're done. Give it up !

674
00:46:48,043 --> 00:46:49,680
Would you in my position ?

675
00:46:49,875 --> 00:46:52,175
I wouldn't be in your position,
you sick fuck !

676
00:46:52,372 --> 00:46:55,250
You sure about that ?
You might wanna chat with Lundy.

677
00:46:56,002 --> 00:46:58,357
You shoot me,
who'll prove your innocence ?

678
00:46:58,497 --> 00:47:00,149
Maybe I'll just kneecap you.

679
00:47:17,492 --> 00:47:19,713
Alright. Nice and slow.

680
00:47:22,822 --> 00:47:26,226
- Back the fuck off, Morgan !
- I'm just following your lead.

681
00:47:27,291 --> 00:47:28,234
Slow down.

682
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,600
You're gonna have to kill me, Morgan !

683
00:48:46,233 --> 00:48:49,077
You're gonna have
to fucking kill me, Morgan !
