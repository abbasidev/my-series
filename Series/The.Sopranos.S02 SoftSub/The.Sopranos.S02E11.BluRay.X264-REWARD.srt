(SOPRANOS THEME SONG)

2
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:32,985
Stop!

3
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,486
Stop! What are you doing?

4
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,321
What are you doing,
you closing me up!

5
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,285
Mister, where do you
suppose you are going?

6
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:45,330
Stop! Stop!
I demand you stop!

7
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:48,709
I demand you come back here
this instant!

8
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:53,130
This instant, you motherfucker!
You motherfucker!

9
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:55,632
Motherfucker!

10
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,176
Motherfucker!

11
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:58,677
(PHONE RINGING)

12
00:02:58,928 --> 00:02:59,761
Yeah.

13
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,346
Zanone Brothers.

14
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,891
This fuckin' series, huh?

15
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,852
Your driver, he comes here,

16
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:09,688
He dumps the garbage
all over the place!

17
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:11,523
He did, huh?

18
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:12,816
What "he did"?

19
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,776
How about those Nets, huh?

20
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:15,569
You come get it now!

21
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:16,904
Get what, sir?

22
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,698
The goddamn, goddamn garbage.

23
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,950
We thought you wanted it back.

24
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:22,951
What?!

25
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:24,703
What?!

26
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,121
The rag-head from the deli.

27
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,874
Hello, where are you?

28
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,252
You called yesterday
to complain?

29
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,796
That's our policy,
it's written on our trucks.

30
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,591
Double your garbage back
if you're not satisfied.

31
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:44,640
I complain because you didn't make
full pickups on 12, 16, 20th.

32
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:47,309
And then I get
charged double for it!

33
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:50,020
Right, we had to come out twice.

34
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:54,066
You charge me double
for pickups you miss?

35
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:57,402
My dispatcher asked you
if you're not satisfied

36
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,696
Did you want your garbage back?

37
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:02,157
Of course I don't
want garbage back!

38
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,159
Then you're satisfied.

39
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,454
You are speaking shit to me.

40
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,250
We'll try to send
a truck out tomorrow.

41
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:19,383
What are we talking,
eight to 10?

42
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:23,345
(KNOCKING) For god sake Alan, I can
plead him out of three to five.

43
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,892
All right, talk to Mike Gendler,
see what he says.

44
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:30,852
What's all this?

45
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:33,981
You looked thirsty
last time I saw you.

46
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:40,279
Oh, yeah, you know what?
I knew I left this someplace.

47
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:43,949
New?

48
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,617
You know, keeping busy.

49
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,286
Carmela, the kids?

50
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:47,953
Good.

51
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,496
You know, school shit.

52
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,290
You bet that game last night?

53
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,249
Yeah.

54
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,918
What do you think
I need this for?

55
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:58,380
(CLEARING THROAT)

56
00:04:58,548 --> 00:04:59,923
So, what do I
owe you, counselor?

57
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:02,467
You'll pay me when I actually
have to do something.

58
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,803
Let's hope that fuckin' day
never comes, right?

59
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,680
It almost did very recently.

60
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,058
Here we go, the Neil Mink
lecture series.

61
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:13,061
Well, isn't it fair to say
we were staring into the abyss?

62
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:15,605
A very close call, that brush
with a murder beef.

63
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,608
I told you, I was home alone.

64
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:20,819
You and Macaulay Culkin.

65
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,364
Except that neither one of you
would have been alone.

66
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:26,783
Champagne's nice.

67
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,161
But you want
to give me a real gift?

68
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,997
Insulate yourself
from these shenanigans.

69
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:33,248
I told you once already.

70
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:33,957
I do.

71
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,000
I am.

72
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,460
What the fuck you want from me?

73
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,962
Use one of the businesses
we've got you in,

74
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,466
for something besides
showing income on a tax return.

75
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,218
Spend time
at garden state rendering.

76
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,971
Oh, please, you know what
boiling fat smells like?

77
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:50,390
You have an office
at Barone Sanitation.

78
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:53,935
Get your ass out of that
strip club and go there.

79
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:56,855
All right, I hear you.

80
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:59,191
The feds are
a business, Anthony.

81
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,778
Millions of tax dollars
invested in watching your ass.

82
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:04,988
Sooner or later just like you,

83
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,033
They're gonna want a return
on that investment.

84
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,286
Mother of fucking mercy.

85
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:14,289
What'd you take
a sledgehammer to my balls?

86
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:17,667
That's just the incision
where I inserted the stent.

87
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,378
You're gonna feel
a little tenderness.

88
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,712
Okay, almost there.

89
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:21,546
Easy.

90
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,092
You should use
the bedpan next time.

91
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,510
I'm not a cat.

92
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,928
I don't shit in a box.

93
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,554
You have to watch your heart.

94
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,847
My heart's fine.

95
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,892
When I get out of here
we're going to a discotheque,

96
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:34,643
you and me.

97
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,853
Discotheque.

98
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:39,689
What's so funny?

99
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,069
Mr. Soprano.

100
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,279
I'm Michael McLuhan from
the U.S. Marshal Service.

101
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:49,658
Here to reattach
your electronic bracelet.

102
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,078
They you give you
the important jobs, huh?

103
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:55,497
(NURSE)
Excuse me.

104
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:57,582
Your name's really McLuhan?

105
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:58,333
Right.

106
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,753
So, that makes you
Marshal McLuhan.

107
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,755
That's right.

108
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,341
What?

109
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,801
What's the fucking joke?

110
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:12,431
All right, you may feel
some pressure in your chest.

111
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:15,308
But that'll go away as the blood
flow to heart increases.

112
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:18,103
Just stay in bed,
plenty of fluids.

113
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,729
Get you home tomorrow.

114
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,482
Lucky fucking me.

115
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:29,698
Sandwich or something?

116
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,159
Did you hear me with my balls,
who can fucking eat?

117
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:48,800
(DJ ON RADIO)... New York's only
classic rock station, Q-104...

118
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:00,479
What are you looking at?

119
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,023
Nothing.

120
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,025
Just looking out the window.

121
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,028
Gettin' my eyebrows done.

122
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:19,247
(POP SONG PLAYING)

123
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:13,510
Remember...

124
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,845
One mouth, two ears.

125
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,764
Listen to each other.

126
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,103
I'll see you next week.

127
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,479
Okay.

128
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,906
(DOOR CLOSING)

129
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,500
So, what's up?

130
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,214
I don't know, I'm...

131
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,133
I'm bored or something.

132
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,886
I don't want
to come here no more.

133
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,305
Well...

134
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,476
Not the first time
we've heard you say that.

135
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:51,983
No offense, but let's face it,

136
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,860
this is starting to feel
like a waste of time.

137
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,570
I'm sure for the both of us.

138
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,405
I don't feel that way.

139
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:05,205
Like the other day
I'm watching this movie

140
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:10,001
with Brad Pitt and that blonde,
Gwyneth Paltrow.

141
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,628
"Sliding Doors"?

142
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,129
Fuck no, "Seven".

143
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,591
It's a good movie,
and I never seen it before.

144
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:21,638
But halfway through it,
I'm thinking, this is bullshit.

145
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,182
A waste of my fucking time.

146
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,685
Why do I give a shit
who the killer is?

147
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:30,146
What difference Is that information
gonna make in my life?

148
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,898
Very true.

149
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:33,525
So, I shut it off.

150
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,610
Good for you.

151
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,071
What did you do instead?

152
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,616
I went out in the yard and burned
ants with a magnifying glass.

153
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,455
A little sense of humor here?

154
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,335
What's the matter?

155
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,462
You still in mourning over
the coming of managed care?

156
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,298
Go on.

157
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,050
What's the point?

158
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,886
You go to Italy,
you lift some weights,

159
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,388
you watch a movie.

160
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,808
It's all a series of
distractions 'til you die.

161
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,935
I hear Depression talking.

162
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,688
Yeah, well, I'm not
upping my dosage.

163
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,231
Medication, medication,

164
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,108
medication, what do I
got to show for it?

165
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,486
Who knows where you'd be
without the medication?

166
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:23,158
Anyway, some people
take pleasure

167
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,827
in the simple doing of things.

168
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,496
Yeah, well, the things
I take pleasure in, I can't do.

169
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:33,251
Currently trying
to change my business profile,

170
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:34,753
if you know what I mean.

171
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:37,380
So, it's all about
your legal problems.

172
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,891
(SIGHING)

173
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:02,697
I'm gonna get the car.

174
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,574
Don't disappear,
meet me out front.

175
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,118
Corrado?

176
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,454
I thought that was you.

177
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,373
Catherine... Romano.

178
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,043
Catherine.

179
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:18,671
Mr. Soprano, you have to stay in the
wheelchair until you leave the building.

180
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:19,964
Hospital rules.

181
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,299
So, call a cop.

182
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,259
A little procedure,

183
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,637
you'd think that they'd
worry about the sick people.

184
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,597
It's all about the insurance.

185
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,307
You remember my Chuckie?

186
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:31,851
Little Chuckie,

187
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,728
you drove the bike
for the butcher's.

188
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,857
I gotta call Karen, ma.

189
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,403
He's a cop now, like his father.

190
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,363
A detective.

191
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,031
He's a good egg, your Lou.

192
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,575
He was a real straight-shooter,
he had a lot of class.

193
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,746
Hodgkin's, no?

194
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,665
It's been almost 15 years.

195
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,416
That long?

196
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,419
The week the shuttle exploded.

197
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,589
The pension helps.

198
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:02,966
The grandchildren.

199
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,718
You look good, Corrado.

200
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:07,136
You healthy?

201
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,514
A little heart trouble,
nothing much.

202
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:12,851
You broke your ankle?

203
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,519

00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,443
Same house, Watsessing avenue.

206
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:26,322
I'm right on Ampere Parkway
near our beloved alma mater.

207
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,784
Maybe we could have coffee.

208
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:30,410
Catch up.

209
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,829
There's an IHOP
by the dry cleaners.

210
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,875
The doctor says I'm not
supposed to leave the house.

211
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,126
Too much stress.

212
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,506

213
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:45,800

00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,589
all of a sudden you turn
my office into a storeroom?

217
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,760
No, I'm gonna get
this shit cleaned right out.

How ya doing?

224
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:41,773
What happened to Diane?

225
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:45,193
A little self-indulgent when
it came to the office supplies.

226
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:48,279
Connie, Mr. Soprano's
been out the in the field,

227
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,740
but he's gonna be spending
some time with us here at HQ.

228

in here, and Danny too,

boxes out, the books.

230

What should I do with them?

231
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,332
I don't know, make room.

Yeah, I know, I heard.

240
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,188
He tipped a truck
at a deli in Nutley.

241

253

We sat there and we talked
about the fucking Rico act.

You treat different patients.

I don't know.

260

Worse, I guess.

261
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:31,841
Are you an alcoholic?

262
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:41,184
I am drinking
in between sessions.

263
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,228
That's very serious.

264
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,898
Just on the days that I see him.

265
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,609
I can't take it.

266
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,403
Finally, thank you.

267
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,990
Are you taking steps
to seriously end it?

268
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,159
He wanted to end it.

269
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,828
He said last time
he wanted to stop coming.

270
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,121
But I talked him out of it.

271
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:03,456
Why?

272
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,834
If I was at Sloan and
he had a pituitary tumor,

273
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:09,003
would I stop him from coming?

274
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:18,012
Elliot, it's like that thing
with watching a train wreck.

275
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,475
I'm afraid and repulsed
by what he might tell me.

276
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,646
But somehow I can't stop myself
from wanting to hear it.

277
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,949
Okay.

278
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,329

Every time your airway closes down
and you wake up fighting for breath,

285
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,470
it puts tremendous strain
on your heart.

Dr. Schreck is absolutely right
in prescribing this for you.

You're not sick.

289
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:09,981
But testing shows rem-wise,
you have 40 arousals per hour.

290
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,775
More since I met you.

291
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:16,904
Such a thing to say.

292
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:21,868
Arousals mean a change
in your stages of sleep.

293
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,495
You are such a flirt.

294
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,582

Nice to meet you.

362
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:33,726
Nice to meet you.

363
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:38,230
Got any blow?

364
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,108
What?

365
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:42,693
Blow, you know, coke.

366
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,696
What, you don't keep it on you?

367
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,198
I gotta go
to the deli in Nutley?

368
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:47,823
Tony.

369
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,158
You don't sell that shit
along those routes,

370
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:50,326
you understand me?

371
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,786
I'm working with Junior on this.

372
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,287
I don't give a shit
if you're working with Walmart,

373
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,497
knock it the fuck off.

374
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:57,416
I'm trying to earn here,
we're saving for a house.

375
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,627
You got enough in your plate
just picking up garbage.

376
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,337
Not if you and
that fucking association,

377
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,422
and that cocksucker Barone
don't let me expand.

378
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,008
Are you fucking stoonad or what?

379
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,052
After five years.

380
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,054
The cops are finally
leaving garbage alone.

381
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:12,306
A drug bust on one of
those routes is different story,

382
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:14,767
you got the FBI, the D.E.A.,
those fucking pricks

383
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,727
are gonna be breathing
down our necks again.

384
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:18,813
It's a little coke.

385
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,481
What is the big deal?

386
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:21,816
You and my uncle,

387
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,110
you want to deal drugs,
that's your business.

388
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:27,238
You do it on association garbage
routes, it's my fucking business.

389
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,615
It stops today, you got it?

390
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,203
Don't give me your
fucking Manson lamps,

391
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:35,663
just fucking stop.

392
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:39,208
Another thing, don't tip
a truck on a problem customer.

393
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:42,837
I fucking hate the way
you make me fucking ride you.

394
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,631
Now, get the fuck out of here.

00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:11,031
...Municipality went private,

397
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,534
So, now we're bidding on a landfill
down in West Virginia.

398
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,287
(MALE) I started reading
the EPA's new guidelines,

399
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:17,955
on curbside recycling.

400
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,915
I'm telling you,
listen, I'm telling you.

401
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,292
Just listen to me, guys.

402
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,461
I got it right through
the transfer station.

403
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,964
And listen to this, it
scaled out at nearly 3,000 tons.

404
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:28,966
Three-thousand tons.

...Talking about instituting
a yard waste ban,

Oh, my god, Tony.

410
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,200
Call an ambulance!

411
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:56,660
Jesus Christ.

412
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:57,870
Turn him over, Carmela.

413

Tony.

414

The pills, the analysis.

You pay her a fortune,
what is she doing for you?

417
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:09,965
Will you leave me
the fuck alone?

00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:11,800
If it was a man
you'd ring his neck.

419
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:14,011
I got a fucking rash now,
last week or two.

420
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:14,970
Leave me alone.

00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:22,937
Yeah.

425
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:25,189
Just preliminary, but as far
as I can tell, it's...

426
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:26,690
Nothing physical, right?

427
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:30,319
For Chris sake, I just passed out,
if it's nothing physical,

428

then what the fuck
is wrong with me?

429
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:34,657
I would think you'd be relieved.

430
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,408
I'll be relieved when
somebody puts their finger on

431
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:37,993
whatever the fuck it is
that's wrong with me.

432
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:40,913
I wish it was physical, so I could
have it ripped the fuck out.

433
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:44,124
I'm sorry, it's just
very frustrating,

I know you're only
trying to help.

You know, losing
some weight wouldn't hurt.

Shit.

Nah, they were out.

get the flange.

When, St. Smithen's day?

443
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,679
Who was at the door before?

00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:40,806
That lady from the other day.

Catherine?

00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,101
The one with the manicotti.

I gotta be honest, Junior,

451
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:58,824
When I ran into her at
Fountains of Wayne that time,

452
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:00,659
she was very cold.

453
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,538
What was she buying?

Fountain, kid pissing.

455
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:09,752
Must've bought a house.

but what a piece she was.

that's the way of life.

But in "Angela's Ashes" you
were laughing with him at least.

00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:42,660
Every paycheck
squandered on alcohol.

Please, you know
the Irish and their liquor.

The "weakness"
he calls it, right?

(CARMELA) How he can make such
heartache funny is beyond me.

My god, with that father?

00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:55,172
It's true, we don't know
what poverty is in this country.

Did you feel in this one the mother
came off a little nicer?

certain choices about

474

how he is going
to portray people.

475
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,973
Like the nuns in that convent.

Please, Catholic school here
wasn't any better.

477
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,519
He used to be
a school teacher, you know.

478
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:09,770
Some school in Manhattan.

479
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:14,316
My god, the way
he treated that wife.

480
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:17,194
She'd be better off
if he beat her.

Great, about fucking time.

it's un-fuckin'-believable.

It's all original
World War II shit.

from allied headquarters
in London.

personal pearl-handled Lugers,

And get this...

502
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:08,537
We got the jeep that Patton
drove around in, in Sicily.

503

We have ways of dealing
with you, Mr. Soprano!

is that Rosalie read the "Ya-Ya Sisterhood"

516
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,773
(FEMALE)
What? I liked it.

517
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:39,526
(FEMALE) What about something
like "Cider House Rules"?

518
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,029
(CARMELA)
Yeah, but not so sad.

519
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:52,080
So, how's that
English class going?

520
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,000
Comparative Literature, whatever.

521
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,211

was last semester.

Excuse me, could you
move your cigarette?

Pardon me?

533
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,711
It's blowing into my son's face.

534
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:40,712
Thank you.

New Jersey is woefully behind,

538
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:49,721
Mom, it's no big deal.

539
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,932
It's no big deal
to move it either.

540
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,267
I don't think so.

541
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:54,643
I'm sorry?

542
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,144
I'm not gonna move it.

543
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:57,521
Why not?

544
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,273
Because you're very rude.

545
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:02,609
I said "excuse me,"
quite clearly.

546
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:03,777
Your tone.

547
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:06,071
It's a health hazard, move it.

548
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:07,447
No.

549
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,241
I'm a physician,

550
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:12,452
do you know what you're
doing to the rest of us?

551
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,997
My son has taken the trouble
in his own life,

552
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:16,957
to live in a smoke-free dorm.

553
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:18,542
My salutations.

554
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:19,459
Mom.

555
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:21,920
This isn't
a smoke-free restaurant.

556
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:26,049
Look, this is silly, could you
just move the fucking thing?

557
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,801
Not when you talk like that.

558
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:30,137
Just move the cigarette, please?

559
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:31,054
No.

560
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,180
No?

561
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,140
No.

562
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:34,308
Mom!

563
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:35,517
Well?

564
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:36,768
You bitch.

565
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:38,270
She must be drunk.

566
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:39,730
Excuse me, what did you say?

567
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,356
Ma'am, c'mon.

568
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,567
I saw what happened
let's just, shall we?

569
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:44,359
Will you call the police?

570
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:46,904
I don't think that's warranted,
but ma'am...

571
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,238
Oh, no, please, call the police,

572
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,908
because I'm not the one
with a lethal weapon here.

573
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:54,328
Ma'am, I'd like you to leave.

574
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:04,880
C'mon, Jason.

575
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:06,465
I'm outta here.

576
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:17,768
(SOBBING)

577
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:23,398
(RICHIE)
Hello.

578
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:24,608
In here.

579
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:25,817
(JANICE)
Uncle Jun'?

580
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:27,444
In here, the kitchen!

581
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:32,574
Where you been?

582
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,910
I've been calling you
all afternoon.

583
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:37,913
My fucking hand
is stuck down the drain.

584
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,082
And I can't reach
the fucking phone.

585
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:44,336
Good thing I'm nice, 'cause
I could start tickling you.

586
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:45,837
Jesus Christ.

587
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:47,756
How long you been
standing there?

588
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,049
Six hours!

589
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:52,344
Now get the fucking detergent
and lubricate my wrist!

590
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:55,347
Motherfuckin' son of a bitch.

591
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,393
I thought you were Bobby.

592
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,520
Why didn't you
just call a plumber?

593
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,648
With what, my fucking toes?!

594
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:07,401
Relax.

595
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:08,568
Relax.

596
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,487
Let it go limp.

597
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,990
Limp, you're flexing!

598
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,324
Let it go limp.

599
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:15,993
Limp.

600
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,495
That's it, you're flexing.

601
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:21,331
Limp, that's it, simmer down.

602
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:22,749
Simmer down.

603
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:24,459
Easy.

604
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:28,088
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.

605
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,674
Oh, this fucking house.

606
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,175
I'm dying here.

607
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:35,095
Just take it easy, okay?

608
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:43,103
You're coming to the engagement
party at least, right?

609
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:44,813
We'll get special permission.

610
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:47,816
I'll make some coffee.

611
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:50,610
I don't give a shit
if you do or you don't.

612
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,371
It's light.

613
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:03,915
You got your nephew
to thank for that.

614
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:05,083
What do you mean?

615
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:09,337
I ran into him the other day
at the garbage men's ball,

616
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:11,131
whatever the fuck it is.

617
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,218
He said we can't sell coke
on the route anymore.

618
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:16,136
What?

619
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,345
That's what he said.

620
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,765
I guess nobody
should eat, but him.

621
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:21,808
You should have seen him
in the golf outfit,

622
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,436
he looked like Wallace Beery.

623
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:28,023
Where does he
get the effrontery?

624
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:29,941
He's the boss.

625
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,986
Whether he has
grand mals or not.

626
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:34,946
And this shit is okay with you?

627
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:37,407
I know how much
you love him, JR.

628
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:41,078
I don't want to say
anything disparaging.

629
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,627
(DICK) You know how it is,
they're bureaucrats,

630
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:49,836
they nit, they pick.

631
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,546
It's passive-aggressive,
pure and simple.

632
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,632
They have their lives,
themselves.

633
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:56,343
I know, I know,
they're not out in the field.

634
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,970
What can I do?
It's mandatory.

635
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:01,056
Okay, hold on.

636
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:05,060
Connie, get me the paperwork
on the separation requirements

637
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:06,019
for New Jersey.

638
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,354
(CONNIE)
Where is it?

639
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:10,690
I don't know, I put them
with the recycling files.

640
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,529
Can I get you something?

641
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:17,280
Coffee?

642
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:19,407
No.

643
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:20,659
No, I'm all right.

644
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,037
I'll be going home soon.

645
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:36,800
I embarrassed my son.

646
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,636
How's he supposed to know,

647
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:42,556
where this type
of behavior is coming from?

648
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:46,184
Think it's time you considered
a 12-step program?

649
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:48,979
I'm not an alcoholic, Elliot.

650
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,941
Besides, I have you, this.

651
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:56,444
Therapy isn't a substitute,
you know that.

652
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:06,246
I won't drink
with my son anymore.

653
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,291
We're bargaining now?

654
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:12,127
I'll go to a meeting.

655
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,093
I'm also prescribing Luvox.

656
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:21,720
Luvox?

657
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,556
Is for OCD.

658
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,557
Among other things,

659
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:28,143
I've had success with it treating
other compulsions as well.

660
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:30,270
Compulsions?
Elliot, c'mon.

661
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,022
Your patient, Jennifer,

662
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:35,066
your inability to bring
the therapy to a conclusion.

663
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:41,072
Elliot, I honestly believe
that he's not ready.

664
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,158
Refer him to another doctor.

665
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:44,618
You really think that I'm...

666
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,994
Obsessed?

667
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:57,172
Luvox.

668
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:04,387
Jesus Christ.

669
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:09,017
That coke provides
a nice income stream.

670
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,603
Do you have any ideas
the bills I got?

671
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,272
Just keep it away
from the garbage routes.

672
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,233
The lawyers, the doctors,
the prescriptions,

673
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,360
a double sawbuck
for a plastic pillow,

674
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:20,070
just so I can sit comfortably.

675
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:22,614
Why don't you just sit on that
nice pile of cash you got?

676
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:26,076
My finances are nobody's
goddamn business.

677
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:27,953
And that garbage is my business.

678
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,872
I don't want you and that
other shit-bird fucking it up.

679
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:32,249
Your business.

680
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:35,418
Yeah, why don't you get that
through that bald dome of yours?

681
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,298
Why does everything
have to be so difficult?

682
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,928
You know, back in the '50s
we worked together.

683
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,682
Even rival families settled
their differences, amicably.

684
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:51,142
Oh yeah, I remember that picture
of Albert Anastasia lying there

685
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:53,353
all amicable
on the barbershop floor.

686
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:56,898
There were exceptions,
I'm just saying.

687
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,319
Oh, I'm sorry,
should I come back?

688
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:02,779
It's all right.

689
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,614
We're done here.

690
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:08,118
Bad night last night, huh?

691
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:11,621
Let's see if we can't get you a more
comfortable fit on this mask.

692
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,416
That little cupcake,
she never came back.

693
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,502
The one with the mask.

694
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:18,837
Tracey?

695
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:22,757
Sent her a bottle of Shalimar.

696
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,593
She never mentioned it.

697
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,514
You should be happy at least,

698
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:32,100
the stent was
a complete success.

699
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,603
Let's not tempt fate
by taxing the heart.

700
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:38,398
How many migs
you shoot down last week?

701
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,539
Where's that fucking manicotti?

702
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:56,958
It's gone.

703
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:59,002
Half a fucking tray in there!

704
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:00,253
I was hungry.

705
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,881
Son of a bitch.

706
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,884
It's not my fault
you got your hand caught.

707
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:07,260
Why do you have to be so nasty?

708
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:28,573
(RECORDING) Directory assistant,
what listing?

709
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:32,202
Belleville, I need a number
for a Catherine Romano.

710
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,788
Thank you, for what city?

711
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:37,165
Cocksucker, Belleville!

712
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,710
Please hold for an operator.

713
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:46,674
Any allergies, shellfish, perhaps?

714
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,259
No, I eat shrimp all the time.

715
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:52,013
MSG? Any change in medication?

716
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:52,847
No.

00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:56,851
A new laundry detergent,
something like that?

718
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:59,354
I don't know, I don't think so.

719
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:03,525
Have you been under
any undue stress lately?

720
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,276
Is that the only word
you people know?

721
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:08,154
Sometimes pressure can result
in contact dermatitis.

722
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:09,572
Oh, is that what that is?

723
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:11,199
See, now I knew that was bad.

724
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:12,575
It means rash.

725
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:16,496
Look at it,
it's bleeding, for Chris sake.

726
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:18,081
You've been scratching it.

727
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:21,960
You said you work at
a sanitation transfer station.

728
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:26,005
Dollars to donuts, you're being
exposed to an irritant in the air.

729
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:28,091
I sit in an office.

730
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:32,053
I'll write you a scrip
for Cortisone cream.

731
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:38,268
Dr. Cusamano tells me you've been
seeing a psychotherapist.

732
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:40,728
So?

733
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:44,607
I suggest you talk about
stress management with him.

To tell the truth,

738
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,928
I was surprised
to hear from you.

739
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:17,348
I was sorry we missed our visit.

740
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,059
I had the feeling
you weren't interested.

741
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:20,935
No.

742
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:21,978
No.

743
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:25,231
I stopped by the other day,
but I guess you were out.

744
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:26,649
It was odd.

745
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,776
I thought I heard you hollering.

746
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,072
Funny how life works.

747
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:34,824

748
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:36,367

something, Corrado?

Was my Lou ever...

752
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,972
You know, on the take?

753
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,517
No, of course not.

754
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,853
Why would you ask such a thing?

755
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:07,398
Sometimes you know,
I'd find money.

756
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:11,528
Hundreds of dollars, cash,
in his pockets at night.

757
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,530
Probably won it
at the racetrack.

You think so?

759
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:17,116
Sure, why not?

761
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,049

some work but, you know,

a little marble,
maybe some new fixtures.

down on the price?

771
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,863
she takes me to Stag Trail road.

Oh, wow.

is just not big enough.

And like Tony says,
it's not our house anyway.

Come here, you gotta
see this bedroom.

I don't know if your parole job

782
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:35,987
at the fish market's
gonna cover it.

783
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:37,572
Tell me about it.

Not that plain sheetrock shit.

786
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:51,377
They put in a lawn
this year, it's new.

787
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:54,714
When'd you put your lawn in?

791
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:06,809
I gotta go.

792
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:07,810
What's the matter?

793
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:08,853
Nothing, just...

794
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,107
I feel hot.

795
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:17,070
Oh my god, you're all clammy,
let's get you home.

and help them.

Yeah.

00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:21,259
I got a call from
a friend of mine in Nutley.

00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:22,468
Guy's a cop.

811
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:25,888
They got Richie's
driver on video.

812
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:29,767
He sold three ounces of coke
at an arcade down there.

Guess we'll have to
torch a truck or something.

Oh, but you don't
want to hear that.

817

And I sure as shit
didn't say it.

on this office pool.

did you hear?

going out Corrado?

Well, what is it then,
your heart?

867
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:39,081
No, it's certain legal difficulties.

868
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,459
The truth is I can't go out.

869
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,169

For the most part though...

878
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,323
I understand if you
don't want to stay.

879
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:15,868
I enjoy you, Corrado,
I always did.

You stay, I'll bring food in.

what's the fucking point?

and I'm still passing out.

is guaranteed in writing?

Where's my happiness then?

890
00:49:57,035 --> 00:49:59,036
It's the pursuit that's guaranteed.

891
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:01,330
Always a fucking loophole, right?

892
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:10,089
Well, you seem
very mellow today.

893
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:12,883
Let's talk about you.

894
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:15,886
You seem like you're on drugs,
and I'm boring myself to death.

895
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:18,180
I'm ready for the George Sanders
long walk here.

896
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:23,144
Do you know why
a shark keeps moving?

897
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:26,522
They gotta keep moving
or they'll die,

898
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:28,232
they can't breathe or something.

899
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:32,236
There's a psychological
condition known as Alexithymia,

900
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:34,739
common in certain personalities.

901
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:40,327
The individual craves
almost ceaseless action,

902
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:44,540
which enables them
to avoid acknowledging

903
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:47,293
the abhorrent things they do.

904
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:48,502
Abhorrent?

905
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:53,549
What certain personalities?

906
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:56,343
Antisocial personalities.

907
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:06,020
My future brother-in-law...

908
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:12,151
Ran over a guy, no reason.

909
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:16,572
Guy's paralyzed, has to
piss into a cathode tube.

910
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:26,582
What happens when these
antisocial personalities

911
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:30,711
aren't distracted from
the horrible shit they do?

912
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:33,464
They have time to think
about their behavior.

913
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:37,093
How what they do
affects other people.

914
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:43,516
About feelings of emptiness
and self-loathing,

915
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,267
haunting them since childhood.

916
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:52,441
And they crash.

917
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,658
Which one of them knew?

918
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:02,827
Knew what?

919
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:05,246
Jerry Grill had asthma...

920
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:07,123
(SNORING)

921
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,542
He never was one
to let common sense

922
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:11,710
get in the way of
whatever he wanted to do.

923
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:14,088
(LOUD SNORING)

924
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,924
What about Chris Newman?

925
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:20,845
Grale's house was the last thing
standing in the way of that new deli.

926
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,888
I'm sure Chris is glad
to see him gone too.

927
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:24,056
What about Howard?

928
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:25,808
Corrado.

929
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:27,268
Hmm?

930
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:30,604
I got caught in
the middle of the fight...

931
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:33,858
And you have no broken bones?

932
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:36,443
Actually they ignored me.

933
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:38,279
Fucking thing.

934
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:41,866
Shh, with that talk.

935
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:45,161
...That he'd been cheatin' on her

936
00:52:45,203 --> 00:52:46,287
Where'd you hear that?

937
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:48,914
Her father told her
while I was standing there.

938
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:51,083
Every one of them had a motive.

939
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:54,044
The thing is who
had the opportunity,

940
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:56,172
and who was it who knew
that he had asthma?

941
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:08,225
I threw.

942
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:10,102
C'mon.

943
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:14,899
Ho, our long lost leader.

944
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,775
Somebody most owe him money.

945
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:18,360
Tony, how you doing?

946
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,112
How's the clay pigeon?

947
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,822
I'm getting there.

948
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:26,368
You could knock Cardozo
Law school all you want,

949
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:29,246
but his lawyer says
the gun charge will not stick.

950
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:30,539
Yeah, congratulations.

951
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:34,960
(CHRISTOPHER) We were just talking
about you know, down the docks.

952
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:38,088
Driving off some off
that Japanese technology.

953
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,423
Hesh knows a guy.

954
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:40,883
Oh, yeah?

955
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:45,429
So, what else is going on?

956
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:48,682
Nothing.

957
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:01,862
I'm having good luck with Swiss
Basics' Moisturizing Formula.

958
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:06,242
Maybe I'll try it.

959
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:10,371
Oh!

960
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:14,375
Yeah!

961
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,126
Goodbye.

962
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:21,799
(CRASHING SOUND)

963
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:23,259
What the fuck?

964
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:30,474
Holy shit.

965
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:32,101
Look at that.

966
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:34,103
(TONY)
It's that dipshit Carmine again.

967
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:37,314
Sil, go tell him no speeding
in the neighborhood.

968
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,023
I'm on it.

969
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:38,732
C'mon.

970
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:40,276
What an asshole.

971
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,820
(SILVIO) Carmine, what the
fuck's the matter with you?

972
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:44,280
How many times
We gotta tell you,

973
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:46,365
do not speed in this
fucking neighborhood?!

974
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:48,492
(FURIO YELLING
IN ITALIAN)

975
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:54,290
(SIL)
C'mon, you hurt?

976
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:55,040
That's too bad,

977
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:57,584
you should be fucking crippled,
you fucking asshole!

978
00:54:57,794 --> 00:54:59,837
Don't do that again,
you understand me?!

979
00:54:59,879 --> 00:55:00,671
Understand me?

980
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:03,090
People could be fucking hurt,
you know that?

981
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:04,049
You know that?

982
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:05,217
You all right?

983
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:06,510
You sure?

984
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:10,347
Tony.

985
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:12,725
Oh, Agent Harris.

986
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:13,934
How are you?

987
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:14,810
Good, good to see you.

988
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:17,021
I was in the neighborhood, I wanted
to introduce you to my new partner.

989
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:18,897
Joe Marquez, Tony Soprano.

990
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:21,358
What's the matter,
no openings in the post office?

991
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:24,320
How 'bout those Nets, huh?

992
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:25,529
What a series.

993
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:27,239
It's that guy, Williams.

994
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:28,365
Yeah, he's good.

995
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:30,576
That fourth quarter was amazing.

996
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:32,119
How'd the Knicks do?

997
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:33,829
It was close, really close.

998
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:35,998
Look at this asshole.

999
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:37,124
Friend of yours?

1000
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:40,169
He drives too fast, and he's
always fucking hitting shit.

1001
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:44,006
