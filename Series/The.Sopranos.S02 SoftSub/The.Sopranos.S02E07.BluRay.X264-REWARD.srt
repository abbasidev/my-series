Oh, my God.

(MALE)
What did you freak out for?

6
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:14,383
Holy shit!

7
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:29,064
- How you doing?
- Hey, how's it going?

8
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,524
How you doing?

9
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:32,151
How's your broccoli?

10
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:35,737
Adriana, this is my cousin Gregory,
the ambulance chaser.

11
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,157
This is my fiancée, Amy Safir.

12
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,492
Pleasure to finally meet you
in person.

13
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:43,203
Greg gives me updates
on his New York cousin.

14
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:45,038
We're from Jersey.

15
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,791
My apologies.
That's the redeye talking.

16
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:50,169
Your earrings are so excellent.

17
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,171
Thank you.

18
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,548
- How was your flight?
- Fine, good.

19
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:00,637
Morgan Stanley's night out.

20
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:05,434
Christopher said you're shooting
a movie. Must be interesting.

21
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:08,187
This is the first project
I brought in to Jon.

22
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:09,980
- Who's Jon?
- Jon Favreau.

23
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:12,232
She's head of development.
I told you.

24
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,026
You said Tarantino.

25
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:17,154
I worked for Quentin.
He's still a friend.

26
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:20,073
Anyway, Favreau snapped her right up.

27
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,367
That movie he did, Swingers...

28
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:25,204
...Vince Vaughn is so cute!

29
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,998
So, Christopher,
how goes the screenplay?

30
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:30,751
It's one of the best I've ever read.

31
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,337
Fucking-A!

32
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,714
Hey, easy, okay?

33
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:37,841
What's he like?

34
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:42,471
Funny, smart, totally accessible.
You guys should come visit the set.

35
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:46,266
- No, I meant Vince Vaughn.
- Great, great. A friend.

36
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:49,478
So, when do we get to read this opus?

37
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,979
I flushed it long ago.

38
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:55,150
Remember what I told you on the phone,
mob stories are always hot.

39
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,402
You should keep your mouth shut.

40
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,530
What do you do, Adriana?

41
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,701
Well, right now
I'm in the food service industry.

42
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,664
(ADRIANA)
Christopher.

43
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:10,999
- You, get up.
- Who? Me?

44
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,043
What does he want?

45
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,545
Hey, bridge-and-tunnel boy, chill out.

46
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:27,641
Guys, let's go to Tribeca Grill.
It's cooler.

47
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,143
- It's better.
- Why are we leaving?

48
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,521
Just do it.

49
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:38,277
She seemed so down-to-earth
for a Hollywood person.

50
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:41,613
What's with those clothes?
She in The Addams Family?

51
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,324
That's Prada!

52
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:47,244
If I was Greg, I wouldn't allow it.

53
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,663
You look like a woman, not a bellhop.

54
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:52,082
Jon Favreau, he's great!

55
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:55,210
He's also a writer.
You should show him your script.

56
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,753
Swingers?

57
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:59,840
He can suck my dick.
That swings too.

58
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,216
Jeez.

59
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:04,886
Well, that acting class
really rubbed you the wrong way.

60
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,472
I love movies,
but I just want to be a player.

61
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,975
I don't want to fuck
with the other shit.

62
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,269
So? Be a player.

63
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,397
We'll go to the set, she invited us.

64
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:17,190
Slip them your script.

65
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,610
That's what they call it,
"Slippin' the script."

66
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,363
Who knows, you know?

67
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:27,492
Would it be so frigging horrible
to attend a premiere?

68
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:30,829
I don't even have the thing.
I threw it away.

69
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,625
What?

70
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,128
You have a copy?

71
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:42,507
- I told you, I'm not interested.
- I believe in you.

72
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,358
(ENGINE STARTING)

73
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:01,902
It wasn't my fault.

74
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,779
You stole my car.

75
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,572
Where's the trust?

76
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,909
When I get confirmed, I'll be a man.
So why can't I drive?

77
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,660
You want to get into this?

78
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:14,539
Who's that man we picked up
at camp last year for bed-wetting?

79
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:18,460
- That was two years ago.
- You could have killed those girls.

80
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:22,005
- That would have been interesting.
- What did you just say?

81
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:24,758
Death shows the
ultimate absurdity of life.

82
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:27,761
Are you trying
to get me to lose my temper?

83
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:30,389
I'm about to put you
through that window.

84
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,766
See, that's what I mean.

85
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:34,226
Life is absurd.

86
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:35,685
Don't say that!

87
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,854
God forgive you!

88
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,231
There is no God.

89
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:39,940
- Hey!
- Hey!

90
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,817
Where is this coming from?

91
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,653
What, do they teach you
this crap at school?

92
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,406
Is this this new English teacher,
Mr. Clark?

93
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,241
Where is he from?

94
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,535
- Answer me!
- Oberlin.

95
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,454
Want him to read
something other than Hustler?

96
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,998
Hello?
He got assigned The Stranger.

97
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,710
You want him to be educated
just to make more money?

98
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,921
This is education.

99
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:06,341
Do you ever think, like,
"Why were we born?"

100
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:11,346
Madame de Staël said, "In life one must
choose between boredom and suffering."

101
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:13,640
Go to your room.

102
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:19,688
No, I'm serious. Why were we born?

103
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:26,194
We were born because
of Adam and Eve, that's why.

104
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,238
Now go upstairs and do your math.

105
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,782
Algebra? That's the most boring.

106
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:34,202
Your other choice is suffering.
You want to start now?

107
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,164
Move your ass!

108
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,467
Jesus Christ, let me think.

109
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,260
You wake me up...

110
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,220
...my head's all cobwebs.

111
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,723
Wyczchuk, Wyczchuk.

112
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,893
Waldemar Wyczchuk, you had
lobster fra diavolo with him...

113
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,770
...in Atlantic City,
on the 14th of this month.

114
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,772
He got blown up? Fuck.

115
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:06,651
We're not trying to pin this
on Soprano or anybody in your crew.

116
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,905
We're drawing no conclusions.
But what do you got?

117
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,948
- If I had coffee...
- Cut the quips.

118
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,742
Tell me about the merger!

119
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:17,496
What's to say? Philadelphia's
put pressure on the shy business?

120
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,916
That's been going on
since Moses wore short pants.

121
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,919
Tony's still resisting
the Philly overtures?

122
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:37,390
Sometimes you don't act like a guy
facing 30-to-life for selling H.

123
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,267
Don't get heavy with me.

124
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,895
You come here because somebody's
leaning on you?

125
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,147
Eight o'clock a.m. you come here?

126
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:48,944
You know what this looks like?
I'm doing all I can to help you guys.

127
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:56,868
One time Tony bought a pool table
from Wyczchuk.

128
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,583
So he asks me:

129
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:08,338
"If there's no God, why was I born?"
Tells me he's got no purpose.

130
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:09,839
How did you answer?

131
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,300
That it costs $150,000
to bring him up...

132
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,928
...so if he's got no purpose,
I want a refund.

133
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,514
Are you angry with him about the car?

134
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:22,435
You can't put shit back in the donkey.
Boys'll be boys. It's the other crap.

135
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,979
It's not normal.

136
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,732
Adolescent angst is very normal.

137
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,526
You never went through it?

138
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:32,529
You think my mother and father
would stand for that?

139
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:34,406
How is your mother?

140
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,491
She's dead to me.

141
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:43,081
And how's Anthony Jr.
been taking it?

142
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,458
What? About the family?

143
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,545
About your nonrelationship
with his grandmother?

144
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,715
How's he supposed to understand that?

145
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:55,885
And in general the whole strain
of the atmosphere in your house?

146
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:59,055
But that don't give him
the right to mouth off.

147
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:03,518
Sounds to me like Anthony Jr.
may have stumbled onto existentialism.

148
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:08,648
- Fucking Internet.
- No, it's a European philosophy.

149
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,692
After World War II...

150
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:15,113
...people were disillusioned
by the sheer weight of the horrors.

151
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:20,076
That's when the whole idea took root
that there were no absolute truths.

152
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,787
- You believe that?
- In your family...

153
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,624
...even motherhood's up for debate.

154
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,460
I teach him to love and respect
his mother.

155
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,253
What about your mother?

156
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:38,470
I think it's important we talk about
your mother and what she tried to do.

157
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,096
Don't need to.

158
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,267
She showed her true colors,
that's all.

159
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:49,731
Has Anthony Jr. heard you say,
"She's dead to me"?

160
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,399
I don't know.

161
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:56,780
Don't you think that kind of talk
could lead him to embrace these ideas?

162
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,407
- So now this is my fault?
- No.

163
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,495
When some people first realize
they're solely responsible...

164
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,414
...for their decisions,
actions and beliefs...

165
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:10,001
...and that death
lies at the end of every road...

166
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:13,046
...they can be overcome
with intense dread.

167
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,422
Intense dread?

168
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,092
A dull, aching anger...

169
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:21,638
...that leads them to conclude
that the only absolute truth...

170
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,556
...is death.

171
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,189
I think the kid's onto something.

172
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,907
Ready to go? Okay, pictures up!

173
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,367
- Lock up!
- Here we go!

174
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,119
They're ready to roll.

175
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,955
Stand by to roll. Quiet, please!
Roll sound!

176
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,791
- We are rolling!
- Camera!

177
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,876
Smoke out! Cameras rolling!

178
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,045
And... action!

179
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,840
My leg. I think it's broken.

180
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,508
- Okay, cut!
- That's a cut!

181
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,802
- Check the gate.
- Check the gate.

182
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:03,763
- Camera reloading.
- Michele, can I talk to you?

183
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:06,683
- Come on.
- Holy shit, that's...

184
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:08,935
She was in Kings of Comedy.

185
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:12,814
The other one too. That movie
my girlfriend likes with Uma.

186
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,357
What's her name?

187
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,402
Jon, this is Christopher.

188
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:18,778
How's it going?

189
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:21,322
It's a treat. Swingers kicked ass.

190
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,199
Thanks. Thank you.

191
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:26,035
Thanks for coming,
I appreciate it. Seriously.

192
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:30,206
What were you doing before
writing for Los Angeles?

193
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,792
Jon, this is Christopher.

194
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:37,964
I'm sorry... There's a guy
from Los Angeles Magazine...

195
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:41,176
...doing a story
on my favorite place for breakfast.

196
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,719
But you're...

197
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,263
...the guy from Jersey, right?

198
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:49,601
Cool. Very, very cool.

199
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,686
Michele Foreman, our director...

200
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,439
...she's from Jersey.
You see her first picture?

201
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,940
She's a director?

202
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,985
Beautiful film.
Won the Audience Award at Sundance.

203
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,362
It was also hilariously funny.

204
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,990
This lesbian, romantic,
screwball comedy.

205
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,367
This one's mainstream.
It's about spies.

206
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,496
So we're getting ready
to shoot the last scene...

207
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:13,166
...and this is where the two
lesbians, the lovers, they die.

208
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:17,170
- Janeane, her character's "Zephyr"...
- That's her fucking name.

209
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:18,713
Janeane Garofalo.

210
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:22,509
So she's been chasing "Gina,"
Sandra, all around the country.

211
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,261
- Gina?
- Gina Shecter, from Brooklyn.

212
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:29,557
The character. They ended up in SoHo,
had a standoff and shot each other.

213
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,894
Picture's up. Let's lock up!
Quiet, please!

214
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,854
- Excuse me.
- And smoke.

215
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,565
Stand by to roll. Quiet, please.

216
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,445
The silencers underscore
their voiceless place in society.

217
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,072
Camera rolling!

218
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,448
Rolling!

219
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:47,784
- Smoke out!
- Quiet!

220
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,286
We're rolling!

221
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,038
Cameras rolling!

222
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,166
- And spin the wheel!
- Spin it! Spin it!

223
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:58,002
And... action!

224
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,714
I never had an egg cream.

225
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:05,051
They're not coming
for either one of us.

226
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,679
You live your whole life in a place...

227
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,139
...and never taste
what it's famous for.

228
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:12,934
Couldn't hear the shots
with this thing.

229
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,103
There's a place on St. Mark's...

230
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,771
It's over, you bitch.

231
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,439
Don't do it.

232
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,193
Michele! I'm sorry.

233
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:25,613
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Can we cut for a second?

234
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,116
- Cut!
- Are we really gonna say "bitch"?

235
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,952
- You don't like it?
- We discussed it. We're losing light.

236
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:35,248
It's the last thing she says to me.
I don't find it very interesting...

237
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,083
Should you shoot her again?

238
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,334
Wait a minute.

239
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:42,338
I don't think shooting's right.
Her strength is her passivity.

240
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,299
- Whose passivity?
- Zephyr.

241
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,593
- Yeah, in this case.
- In this case.

242
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:48,303
I think he's right, Janeane.

243
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:51,139
Throughout the piece,
you've got testes to burn.

244
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:54,350
Well, is there anything
other than "bitch"?

245
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,185
Pucchiacca.

246
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,148
- What?
- Let that one...

247
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,276
...call that one "pucchiacca."

248
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,695
That sounds more interesting.

249
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,158
Bouk... what?

250
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,494
Pucchiacca. I mean,
if she's from Brooklyn...

251
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,331
That sounds okay.

252
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,874
Okay, let's roll.

253
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,168
- What's it mean?
- Cunt.

254
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,128
"Cunt." I like that.

255
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,255
Picture's up. Lock up!

256
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,049
- Stand by to roll!
- Quiet!

257
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,592
Roll sound!

258
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,010
Camera's rolling.

259
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:31,512
- We are rolling!
- Quiet!

260
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:32,889
We have feed.

261
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,557
- Smoke!
- Take three.

262
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,142
Smoke line in!

263
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,687
- We're rolling!
- Quiet!

264
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,147
- Rolling!
- Smoke out!

265
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:42,899
- Marker!
- Set.

266
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,068
And... action!

267
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,993
- All right, what's going on with you?
- Nothing.

268
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:55,620
Nothing.

269
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,831
That "No God" shit
upset your mother very much.

270
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:02,085
It's not "No God."
It's just, God is dead.

271
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,336
Who said that?

272
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:07,215
Nietzsche. He's a 19th century
philosopher from Germany.

273
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,509
That's why
I'm not getting confirmed.

274
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:13,846
Enough with that shit. It's this
weekend and you're getting confirmed!

275
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:16,891
- That sucks my nut!
- Hey!

276
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:20,937
You got balls. You go to Catholic
school and your mother wants it!

277
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:22,772
What does she know?

278
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:25,525
That even if God's dead,
you'll still kiss his ass.

279
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,236
Hey!

280
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,784
- Hey, Joey.
- Chris, how's it going?

281
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,744
- Coke and a slice.
- Coming up.

282
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:40,873
The best pie in North Jersey.
What do you want? It's taken care of.

283
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,459
- Same. Coke and a slice.
- Coke and a slice.

284
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:44,711
You got it.

285
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,755
That laundromat across the street?

286
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:52,051
That's where Joe's Restaurant used to
be. Willie Moretti bought it there.

287
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:55,930
Wait, Moretti was... That was
Sinatra's guardian angel, right?

288
00:16:56,181 --> 00:17:00,393
Stuck his gun in Tommy Dorsey's mouth
and bought Sinatra's contract for $1.

289
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:05,523
The inspiration for Johnny Fontane
and the studio boss in GF I, right?

290
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:06,941
Right.

291
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:10,486
That's the one beef I had
with Swingers.

292
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,407
You patterned yourself after
Frank and Dean but there was a...

293
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,451
..."pussy-assness" to it.

294
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,956
It was kind of the point of the piece.
I mean, it's like...

295
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,667
So you brought us your script.

296
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,544
- Yeah, but...
- Let's see it.

297
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,421
No, you're Jon Favreau.

298
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,424
Rocky Marciano, Deep Impact,
Swingers.

299
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:36,179
Your script is set in a world I
want to do my next project in.

300
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,765
A picture on the life
of "Crazy" Joe Gallo.

301
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:42,310
They already did
The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight.

302
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,270
But I see him as tragic.

303
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,691
A flawed and blinkered guy,
but he wanted to learn, to grow...

304
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:50,777
...to read, to paint.

305
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:54,155
He had this yearning,
this hunger for...

306
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,866
Fuck your mother, what's the word?

307
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:00,745
You as Joey Gallo? I don't see that.

308
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:03,081
But I'm part Italian.

309
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,125
Vince, maybe. Vaughn.

310
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:09,962
This project happens to be
a personal passion of mine.

311
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:14,342
I could play Joey Gallo but I don't
want to act unless I can play myself.

312
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,260
Which is understandable.

313
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:19,764
Since Amy mentioned you,
I thought we could work together.

314
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:23,267
You could tell me how
shit goes down, what makes sense...

315
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,561
...what people really say.

316
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,189
But Gallo, I was only 3
when he got whacked.

317
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,775
But speech patterns.
You saw Swingers.

318
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:32,860
Whatever you think of it...

319
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:36,531
...you can tell it's important to me
how people really talk.

320
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:40,993
Like pucchiacca. How can I forget
that? I grew up right in Queens.

321
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,539
It is a long time ago.

322
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,500
You wouldn't be
betraying any oath thing.

323
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:53,506
Holy fucking shit!
That thing is still alive?

324
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:58,553
You believe that 15 years ago
she was a piece of ass?

325
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,555
- What?
- What happened?

326
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:02,682
Forget it.

327
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,726
Come on. It's just us talking here.

328
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,397
A wiseguy friend of mine would
kill me if he knew I told you.

329
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,444
This made guy...

330
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:18,948
...got the most discriminating eye
when it comes to T and A.

331
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,201
He's at a club one night
and this broad's all over him.

332
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:25,705
And she's got a really nice body,
she's horny as hell.

333
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:29,292
So they step outside,
walk over to this picnic ground...

334
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:32,920
...she starts blowing him
next to this swing set.

335
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:37,091
He's about to shoot his load,
reaches down to start fingering...

336
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:41,053
...undoes the skirt, reaches in,
grabs hold of a goddamn prick.

337
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:44,390
- Jesus Christ.
- Crying Game.

338
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,809
This is a true story.

339
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,645
My friend can't let it get out...

340
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:52,732
...and wants to humiliate the freak
as much as he was.

341
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:56,402
So he gets this fucking acid.
Burns everything.

342
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:59,447
He pours it on her arms,
on her face, everywhere.

343
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,490
Her prick.

344
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,243
That's one bad motherfucker.

345
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:08,789
That's how good this broad looked.
Had my friend totally fooled.

346
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,292
She had to get a glass eye.

347
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,177
(HONKING)

348
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,596
Look who's here!

349
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,227
You can't say hello to your uncle?

350
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:31,145
Hey, Uncle Pussy.

351
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,648
Look what my friend
did to Carmela's car.

352
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,399
What were you thinking?

353
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:39,654
You gotta learn to respect the value
of things. This is your property.

354
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,782
Here, go get a soda.

355
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:48,079
- Longest ride of my life.
- What's the matter?

356
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:52,708
He used to be happy-go-lucky. Now
he's moody, questions the universe.

357
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,669
Like father, like son.

358
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:57,171
Fuck you, I'm serious.

359
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:59,799
You're his confirmation sponsor.
Do something.

360
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:03,844
All right. But 13, 14,
they start getting broody.

361
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,973
It's getting so
I don't want to be with him.

362
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:08,557
Use a belt if you gotta.

363
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:12,061
He's bombing in school.
He got a C, 3 D's and an F.

364
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:13,896
Madonna, look at him.

365
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:16,357
Anthony, how you
making out in school?

366
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:19,277
I got a C, 3 D's and an F.

367
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:39,380
(POP SONG ON TV)

368
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:40,589
Hey.

369
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:45,052
- Where you been?
- I was hanging out with Jon.

370
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,847
- Izzacupo?
- Favreau.

371
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,516
You were?

372
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,769
- You went to the set?
- Yeah.

373
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:56,814
Why didn't you call?

374
00:21:57,065 --> 00:22:01,360
We were only there a half-hour,
then they wanted a tour of Jersey.

375
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:04,739
They did?

376
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,786
What?

377
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,706
Vince Vaughn didn't come down there!

378
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:23,424
- Elbow up. Keep it straight.
- Coach is having me pull.

379
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:27,470
Fuck him. My son don't hit
sacrifice flies.

380
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,555
You're up next.

381
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,640
No, I just want to watch.

382
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,185
Snap out of this, Anthony.

383
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:35,811
Come on, it's fun.

384
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,814
Yeah, I know.
I just don't feel like it.

385
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,650
Sometimes you gotta do things
you don't want.

386
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,110
Why?

387
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:46,155
Because your parents say so,
and it's tradition.

388
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:49,075
- Baseball's not my tradition.
- Hell it ain't.

389
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:52,912
Your dad in high school,
was almost All-County Left Field.

390
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:56,332
But I'm not talking about that.
It's about your confirmation.

391
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,000
I don't want to get confirmed.

392
00:22:58,251 --> 00:22:59,919
- Why not?
- Don't matter why not.

393
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:03,756
You're looking for purpose.
Doing what's right is your purpose.

394
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:05,883
- Not according to Nietzsche.
- Who?

395
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,510
Nietzsche.

396
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:09,637
Let me tell you something.

397
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:13,349
Nietzsche wound up
talking to his horse.

398
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,602
And I know what you're gonna
tell me: Sartre, right?

399
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:19,188
Well, Sartre was a fucking fraud.

400
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:22,108
He copped it all
from Husserl and Heidegger.

401
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,027
Go on.

402
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,407
You should start at the beginning.

403
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:31,700
Take a look at Kierkegaard.

404
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,577
Whatever.

405
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:38,624
Kierkegaard said, "Every
duty is essentially duty to God."

406
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,918
"Nigga, be a leader not a follower."

407
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:42,837
- What?
- Master P said that.

408
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,880
You still listen to rap?

409
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,382
Why?

410
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:49,844
It's just all about marketing now.

411
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,318
Welcome to SoHo Grand.

412
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,279
I'm here to see Jon Favreau.

413
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,489
One moment, please.

414
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,451
- Who may I say is calling?
- Jerry from Newark.

415
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,494
He's expecting me.

416
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,706
I'm sorry.
He's requested not to be disturbed.

417
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:21,167
Tell him his 2 p.m. is waiting.

418
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:24,670
He has his telephone programmed
so as to not be disturbed.

419
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,755
It's 2:00 in the afternoon!

420
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,757
Would you care to leave a message?

421
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:34,180
Would you see if Amy Safir's in?

422
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:39,101
Hey! What are you doing here?

423
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:43,647
I was gonna meet Jon about my script
but the "Do not disturb" sign is up.

424
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:47,610
Shooting went very late. We didn't
wrap until 5:30. Come on in.

425
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:54,533
I brought him Jersey's best
"sangweech." Best in the world.

426
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,160
That was very nice.

427
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:59,705
- You want it?
- No, thanks. I brushed my teeth.

428
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:03,083
Here, have a seat. Want some coffee?

429
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:06,879
No, I can't stay.
I got some business to take care of.

430
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,886
If they ever knew I was into this...

431
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:19,141
What I'm saying is, this kind of thing
is unacceptable where I come from.

432
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:24,271
- You know if he read my script yet?
- I have your script.

433
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:27,149
- What?
- Jon asked me to read it.

434
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:30,361
Don't take it personally.
It's the process.

435
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:34,114
Billy Bob wrote something for Jon
and he had me read it first.

436
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,450
Hello?

437
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:39,078
Hey, honey. Your cousin's here.

438
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,873
That's right, the screenwriter.

439
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:46,001
Gregory says, "Go fuck yourself."

440
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,087
Union Square Cafe?

441
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,464
All right, I'll see you there.

442
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:55,594
So, what did you think?

443
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:58,097
- About what?
- My script!

444
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,849
I love movies.
I started with dialogue...

445
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:05,396
...but then you gotta find conflict
and tell the story in picture arcs.

446
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:10,609
I think it's got some real heart.
Some good, raw emotion in it.

447
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,820
You should try and finish it.

448
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:16,448
Yeah, I hit a fucking wall.
Third act shit.

449
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,660
Vicki King in
21 Days to How to Write A Movie in...

450
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,453
...says that's not uncommon.

451
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:24,873
These aren't third act problems,
they're in the second act.

452
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,292
Get the fuck out.

453
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:30,838
See, you ended right here
in the middle of page 83.

454
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:36,468
Yeah, this sentence
could have gone either way.

455
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:40,431
When Frankie says, "I don't know
whether to shit or go blind"...

456
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:43,976
...he's at a crossroads.
He doesn't know.

457
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:48,397
But that's an expression, right?
Like, a joke, "Shit or go blind."

458
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:52,860
No, because later on his father gets
cancer of the eye, what's it called?

459
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,695
Glaucoma or whatever?

460
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:57,948
Runs in the family.
They have to get him a guide dog.

461
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,116
Oh.

462
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:04,705
But the third act starts at page 90.

463
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:06,498
I'm not at the third act yet?

464
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:10,377
Your inciting incident happens
on page 12. It should be on 3.

465
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,671
I knew that arc shit fucked me up.

466
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:15,299
I tried making it three dimensions...

467
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:18,302
Here. Sit. I'll show you.

468
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,890
Okay.

469
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:25,100
See, I was thinking...

470
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:29,605
...if you take the scene where Rocco
is fucking the two Asian strippers...

471
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:31,440
- That's a plot point.
- I know.

472
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:33,776
But my question is, what's at stake?

473
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:37,071
- The jeopardy's unclear.
- What jeopardy?

474
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:41,700
There's a seven-part hierarchy
of human needs...

475
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:45,496
...that explains and clarifies
what drives us.

476
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:48,165
Starting with the basic needs...

477
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:50,834
...like food and water.

478
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,337
So you like my script?

479
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:56,256
It's very good, Christopher.

480
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,843
You want me to tell you all seven?

481
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,012
Seven what?

482
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:04,807
- The human needs.
- Yeah.

483
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,935
- Survival.
- Yeah.

484
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:11,689
- Safety and security.
- Yeah.

485
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:16,485
The need to understand.

486
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:16,336
Hi, Grandma.

487
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:21,133
Grandma?

488
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:22,843
Who is it?

489
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,595
You woke me.

490
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:27,598
It's me, Anthony Jr.

491
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:31,769
I didn't know I had a grandson.

492
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:33,145
I miss you.

493
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:36,732
Yeah, you should.
You never come see me.

494
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,275
I've been busy.

495
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:40,194
Everybody's busy!

496
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,112
And don't lie to me.

497
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:45,115
I know your father forbids
your coming down here.

498
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:48,786
He doesn't. He just doesn't
want us talking about you.

499
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,330
Well, he can go shit in his hat.

500
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,585
He's mad at me right now.

501
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,922
I shouldn't use that kind of talk.

502
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:03,467
Don't let me ever catch you
talking that way.

503
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,011
Now, what did you do bad?

504
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:08,597
My dad doesn't like my attitude.

505
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:11,850
So Uncle Pussy said I
should come down and talk to you...

506
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:14,937
...because you're old
and have wisdom and stuff.

507
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,105
His mother's another one.

508
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:19,942
Well, what did you do?

509
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:22,653
I took Mom's car out
and it got wrecked.

510
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:24,947
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

511
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:28,909
- Was it bad?
- Uncle Pussy already fixed it.

512
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:31,537
- Did you wear your safety belt?
- Yeah.

513
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:34,748
Because there was an article
in the paper the other day...

514
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:39,545
...about a bunch of teenagers
from out near the Delaware Water Gap.

515
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:42,881
They overcrowded their car,
it hit a tree...

516
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:45,050
...and it incinerated.

517
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:46,718
And they got trapped.

518
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:51,056
People could hear them screaming.
They couldn't get out.

519
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:54,226
The safety belts did it.
Buckled them in.

520
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:57,396
See, that's what I mean.
What's the purpose?

521
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:59,565
- Of what?
- Of being.

522
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:01,692
Here on our planet.

523
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,235
The Earth.

524
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:06,029
I mean, those kids were dead meat.

525
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:08,532
What's the use? What's the purpose?

526
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:11,702
Why does everything
have to have a purpose?

527
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:14,079
The world is a jungle!

528
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:18,834
And if you want my advice, Anthony,
don't expect happiness.

529
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:22,546
You won't get it,
people let you down...

530
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:24,840
...and I'm not naming any names...

531
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:28,760
...but in the end,
you die in your own arms.

532
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:34,850
You mean...

533
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:36,351
...alone?

534
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:41,481
It's all a big nothing. What makes
you think you're so special?

535
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:51,491
I guess I won't order us any espresso.

536
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,121
I took an acting class once.

537
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:58,582
Oh, yeah? How'd that go for you?

538
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:01,251
- But I didn't need it.
- Oh, yeah.

539
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:04,838
I figured out as far as movies,
I'll be a player, not an actor.

540
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:07,132
That's smart, man. Like Bugsy.

541
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:10,093
That was another thing
that blew about Swingers.

542
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,763
- The acting?
- Know what was good acting?

543
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:15,557
Hanks! Private Ryan.

544
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,184
"Earn it."

545
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:21,104
It's unfair to compare the two.
One is soldiers dying at Normandy...

546
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:24,524
...the other is guys
looking for blowjobs in Vegas.

547
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,860
Yeah, well, you made the movie.

548
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,406
So...

549
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:35,077
Listen, you mind
if I ask you something?

550
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:41,959
Are you strapped right now?

551
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,046
Strapped?

552
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:47,839
Yeah.

553
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,176
Fuck!

554
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:54,721
Jesus-fucking-Christ, watch out, man!

555
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,182
Holy fuck!

556
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:00,519
Can I ask you something else?

557
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:02,187
That's what I'm here for.

558
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,690
It will not leave this room, I swear.

559
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,775
Have you ever?

560
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:08,777
Have I ever what?

561
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:11,738
- Come on, you know.
- No, what?

562
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:15,534
I'm not gonna answer unless you ask.

563
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,036
No, that's cool, man. I'm sorry.

564
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,163
- You can ask me.
- No, that's cool.

565
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:23,041
Oh, come on. Come on, Rocky.

566
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:27,421
Come on, Rocky, ask me.
Did I what? Have I ever what?

567
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,339
- Nothing, man.
- Come on. What?

568
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,841
Just take it back.

569
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,217
This?

570
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:35,053
- Come on, you're money!
- I think the safety's off!

571
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,222
- Cut it out!
- Come on, you're money.

572
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:38,890
Here we go, you're money.

573
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,350
- Did I ever what?
- Stop!

574
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:42,644
- Did I ever what?
- Just stop!

575
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:49,985
It's not cool, man.
I got dialogue tomorrow.

576
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:52,320
My voice gets scratchy.
It's not cool.

577
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:56,825
So, what did you think of my script?

578
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:03,123
Well, you know Franky?

579
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:06,835
Yeah, I know Franky.
He's my fucking leading man.

580
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:12,799
He's kind of like
a contradictory character.

581
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:18,305
In a good way.
You know, like complex.

582
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:25,729
- Should he wear the taps on his shoes?
- I was gonna ask you.

583
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,231
They sound cool.
They're his trademark.

584
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:31,151
But in the hit
they'll hear him on the roof.

585
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,153
Right, that's a problem.

586
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:36,448
But what I was thinking was...

587
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:40,452
...in this script,
in all scripts really...

588
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:43,663
...it begs to show
more of the author in it.

589
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,458
Your life, your vision.

590
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:49,211
The roof is soft tar!

591
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,131
That'll work.

592
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,467
The roof is soft tar!

593
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:57,177
Okay.

594
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:10,774
And the father
could go blind sooner...

595
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,445
...and then he could smell the tar
on Franky's shoes...

596
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:18,365
...and then he knows
that his son's the killer.

597
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,118
Holy fuck! That's fucking great!

598
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,995
Then he's gotta put one
in his old man's head!

599
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:26,915
Blam! Then another one! Blam!

600
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,209
Fucking brilliant.

601
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:42,764
I spent all day with my friend
picking out her bridesmaid's dresses.

602
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:45,475
I haven't found anything
for the confirmation.

603
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:49,479
With all the flowers coming into bloom,
I'd love to be a June bride.

604
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,064
Here's your June groom.

605
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:54,860
Come on.

606
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,613
Sorry I'm late.

607
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:02,492
I ordered you pasta fagiol
and we'll get an antipasto to share.

608
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:05,078
They got some
rare imported salami.

609
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:09,875
- You feel okay, Christopher?
- I'm fine.

610
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,628
We were discussing Anna's wedding.

611
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,131
- What about you?
- What about who?

612
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,091
Make it a double wedding.

613
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:20,427
First someone has to propose.

614
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:29,477
Has Anna chosen her caterer yet?

615
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,396
- She got Villa de Roma.
- Good.

616
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:33,648
I think Caravaggio's is slipping.

617
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:36,234
- They fired the produce guy.
- Enough!

618
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:39,779
I am so sick of hearing
you people talk about food!

619
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:43,241
All anybody talks about
is prosciutto, cheese and beans!

620
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:44,951
I'm drowning here!

621
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,829
- Christ, take it easy!
- We're not even engaged!

622
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,041
When you're married you'll
understand the importance!

623
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,792
Fuck the importance.

624
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:53,752
Oh!

625
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:07,766
He didn't mean that.

626
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:12,729
Fuck him. I tried so hard
to be supportive with his art...

627
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,774
...and with getting
his screenplay made.

628
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:18,485
His screenplay?

629
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:24,532
Any updates on Wyczchuk?

630
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:28,536
- I'm on it. Nothing's doing.
- We're wiring you for the confirmation.

631
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:31,623
You think I'm wearing a wire
in God's house?

632
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:35,627
Yes. We don't care about the service
but the party after, at Tony's.

633
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:38,296
You motherfuck, I'm the kid's sponsor!

634
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:41,841
Well, who the fuck is sponsoring you,
motherfucker?

635
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:57,482
Sir, I don't want to tell you again,
this is a smoke-free environment.

636
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:09,995
Yo, Amy.

637
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,080
Hey, you.

638
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:13,790
What a nice surprise.

639
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:16,042
Yeah, I was in the neighborhood.

640
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:17,711
Where were you?

641
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:20,880
I was at the big Chloé party.

642
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,967
Sat across from Alphonse D'Amato.

643
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:26,261
God, these things are killing me.

644
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:31,057
I was thinking we could
stop down at Umberto's.

645
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:35,020
Excellent.
I'll just change real quick.

646
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:47,532
I like those.

647
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:51,911
Manolo Blahnik.

648
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:55,081
Let me see.

649
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,793
- What, these?
- Come here.

650
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:02,547
- You want to see these.
- Yeah.

651
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:05,258
You want to see my shoes?

652
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:10,263
- You can look but you can't touch.
- I can't touch?

653
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,572
So, what did your father do?

654
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:29,783
Was he a movie producer?

655
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,993
He's a neurosurgeon at Cedars-Sinai.

656
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:36,331
- Is this question-and-answer hour?
- I want to know about you.

657
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,875
I'm not usually an open person.

658
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:42,837
Your old man didn't press you
to become a doctor like him?

659
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:46,049
- I was premed at Yale freshman year.
- Fucking Yale.

660
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:50,512
I swear, you Jews have your own
Cosa Nostra hidden in that Ivy League.

661
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:55,308
That's very funny.

662
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,810
Very imagistic.

663
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,436
Thank you.

664
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:00,939
So...

665
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:05,110
...that guy in the club the
other night, what'd you say to him?

666
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,195
That's for me to know.

667
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:10,156
Did you make him an offer
he couldn't refuse?

668
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,200
- Nothing.
- Come on.

669
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:17,163
I told him, "Be a good boy and I'll
let this girl blow you afterwards."

670
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:23,461
Ever been with
a member of The Tribe before?

671
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:25,046
- Yeah.
- Really?

672
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,465
You think I discriminate? I'm PC.

673
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:32,679
- No, you haven't.
- Why do you ask if you think you know?

674
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,390
- When?
- I don't fuck and tell.

675
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:37,183
When?

676
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:40,186
Two nights ago.

677
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,818
You ever shag another skinny guinea?

678
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,447
Oh, fuck!

679
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,240
Fuck me!

680
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,286
How are we gonna tell him?

681
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:58,705
Amy, don't do this now.

682
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:02,041
- We'll figure something out.
- I'm not a bad person.

683
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:04,252
Amy, get back here!

684
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:41,247
Shit.

685
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,625
Amy, listen.

686
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:46,878
"Long shot. A nightclub.

687
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:49,172
Not just any nightclub.

688
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:51,466
Cut to close-up on the letter C...

689
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,259
...then an O then a P."

690
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,762
You're not supposed
to be reading that.

691
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:58,473
It's a limited distribution,
numbered draft.

692
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:00,016
"Pull back to reveal...

693
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:03,353
...this is the Copacabana.
Inside it's all fun and games...

694
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:07,774
...as mobsters wine and dine
their beautiful goomars." Jesus!

695
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,277
You can see it!
You can see the movie from the words!

696
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:13,488
This is the way you write a script!

697
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,287
Fucking shit!

698
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:23,998
(KNOCKING)

699
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,917
Hey! Come out of there!

700
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:30,088
He used it!
Because he gave me that tar idea?

701
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:32,048
I could have come up with that!

702
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:33,716
- What?
- The friend of mine...

703
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:36,803
...stone wiseguy.
Jon used his whole fucking story!

704
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:38,888
The she-male and the acid!

705
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:41,558
This is Joey Cippolini's
fucking story!

706
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,476
There's no character Cippolini.

707
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,311
He can't put that in there!

708
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:46,980
It's not the same at all.

709
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:50,567
- What are you talking about?
- Your friend was at a swing set.

710
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:53,027
This guy is at the Statue of Liberty.

711
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:56,698
Don't you understand where I'm from?
I explained it!

712
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:59,450
Where are you going?

713
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:04,038
We can't take it out. We faxed it
to Oliver who's agreed to be attached.

714
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,915
It's his favorite thing.

715
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:10,128
Don't, he's sleeping! Come on,
how mad could your friend get?

716
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:13,047
- 1204 checked out.
- Where is he?

717
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:17,385
This is so absurd of you
to get so bent out of shape!

718
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:27,103
- Production pass?
- I've been on set before.

719
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:29,897
- I still need to see your pass.
- I know Jon.

720
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:34,485
This is a closed set. No visitors,
no press, no friends of Jon.

721
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:36,654
Hey!

722
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:38,156
- Hey, pucchiacca!
- Hi.

723
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:41,075
- Where's Jon?
- He left this morning for L.A.

724
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:44,912
- Fucking, cocksucking, mezzo finocchio!
- What does that mean?

725
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:47,206
You got more stuff like that
I can use?

726
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:54,505
The confirmation starts in an hour.

727
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:57,592
Would you let me in?
I need to put my face on.

728
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:04,974
You've been in there all week!

729
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:06,601
I'm shaving!

730
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:09,937
I don't want you coming in!

731
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:13,358
The only goddamn mirror
with any good light is in there!

732
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:18,696
- Here's your fucking mirror!
- Fuck! Jesus!

733
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:41,636
Don't open that fucking door!

734
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,138
Shit.

735
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:52,063
What the fuck!

736
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:54,148
I'll kill you, you fucking bitch!

737
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,526
- I'll kill you!
- Let go of me!

738
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,736
- I'll kill you!
- Dad!

739
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:01,656
Jesus Christ!
What the fuck's with you?

740
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:06,452
What, are you bleeding?

741
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:21,968
He'll be with you shortly.
May I get you a water?

742
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:24,178
No, thank you.

743
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:28,433
Wow, Robert Rodriquez has signed on
to do a remake of Viva Zapata!

744
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:30,226
...with Harvey and Bob.

745
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:34,605
- You don't return my fucking messages?
- Christopher, this is so not cool.

746
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:39,110
You listen to me now, you stupid
bitch! You cannot use that story.

747
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:41,487
This is neither
the time nor the place.

748
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:45,366
- What, you want to see me clipped?
- Have you touched base with Jon?

749
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:47,952
I spoke to his jerk-off assistant...

750
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:50,788
...she said I should
take it up with you.

751
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:54,459
I'm sorry. I don't even know who
that would be, that assistant.

752
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:57,170
- Are you here to see...?
- Get the fuck out!

753
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:01,299
Look, I'm flying into L.A.
this afternoon. We'll touch base.

754
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,135
You were just gonna leave?

755
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:06,721
What are you talking about?

756
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,055
My script.

757
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:11,642
Based on Mickey Blue Eyes'
first weekend foreign...

758
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:16,314
...there's a wait-and-see attitude on
Mafia projects. We'll have to pass.

759
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:18,691
Did Jon say that?
Are those his words?

760
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:21,152
I speak for Jon
and if you let me finish...

761
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:24,530
...we assure you we'll look
at anything else you write.

762
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,449
- You're good.
- Christopher...

763
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,035
Fucking Walnuts don't lie
as good as you.

764
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:30,119
Amy.

765
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:33,414
David's ready to see you.
Right this way.

766
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:38,628
Chris, it was wrong with us...

767
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:40,922
...and Greg...

768
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:42,590
...and all that.

769
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:46,135
I really liked you.

770
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:54,393
This is getting kind of
William Inge here.

771
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,145
I gotta go.

772
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:58,356
You fucking D-girl!

773
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:01,067
Excuse me?

774
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:04,070
Excuse me, I'm a vice president...

775
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:06,364
...you fucking asshole.

776
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:12,829
Thanks for coming.

777
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:15,748
Hey! There they are!

778
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:17,917
Congratulations.

779
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:19,293
Thanks.

780
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:20,962
Kid did good up at the altar.

781
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:22,004
Sabenedic'.

782
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:23,089
(DOORBELL)

783
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:26,175
- Were you proud of him?
- Oh, yeah.

784
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:28,636
- Where's Carm?
- In the kitchen.

785
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:32,348
- Ange!
- Some place you got here.

786
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:34,976
Hey, Richie. Have a drink.

787
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:37,436
Fucking resorts international.

788
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:38,896
Hey, little brother.

789
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:41,858
No, the bar's down the hall.

790
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:43,693
Over there.

791
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:45,736
Oh, and we count the silverware.

792
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:49,740
Hi. I'm Janice Soprano.

793
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:52,368
- Janice now?
- I don't know.

794
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:56,873
Listen, I heard we won't be bothered
anymore from our neighbor Wyczchuk.

795
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:59,876
- No neighbor of mine.
- What did you hear on that?

796
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:01,586
Tony, we're out of ice.

797
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:03,921
All right.

798
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:14,098
(COUGHING)

799
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:15,975
Here.

800
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:21,439
- Give it to me.
- Hey, give me a hit.

801
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:27,111
Oh, shit.

802
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:29,363
You two, get out of here.

803
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:34,493
We also need some more Cokes and...

804
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:35,953
What's that smell?

805
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:42,501
What kind of animal smokes marijuana
at his own confirmation?

806
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:45,338
- I don't know.
- Enough with, "I don't know"!

807
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:48,841
Why yell at me? Even Grandma
says the world has no purpose.

808
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:51,802
Get inside right now
and join your guests.

809
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:56,265
Be a good Catholic for 15 fucking
minutes! Is that so much to ask?

810
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:15,034
- What happened? What's the matter?
- You don't want to know.

811
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:18,162
Fucking kid's in the garage
getting high.

812
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:20,665
All right, let me talk to him.

813
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:32,551
Anthony.

814
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:34,428
Go away.

815
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:36,931
No. I'm your sponsor.

816
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:39,517
We need to talk. You need to listen.

817
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:52,571
You see your parents as these great
big dictators. These disciplinarians.

818
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:55,700
But I know your Dad
from when he was younger than you.

819
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:58,077
What difference does it make?

820
00:49:58,328 --> 00:49:59,996
Listen to me, all right?

821
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:01,539
You listening?

822
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,040
Yeah.

823
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:04,875
I know him.

824
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:10,923
I was 16 years old
and my kid sister, Nucci...

825
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:13,676
...she had the spinal meningitis...

826
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:16,762
...and she got to a point
where she couldn't breathe.

827
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:21,183
- She was real sick?
- Yeah.

828
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:25,938
And she was in the hospital, and
your father, he was the only one...

829
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:27,857
...he came with me every day.

830
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:31,402
He sat by her bed.
He looked at her drawings.

831
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:35,948
He watched her when I had to use
the john or get something to eat.

832
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:41,162
I was waiting for a hamburger
when she passed away.

833
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:46,000
- She died, huh?
- Yeah.

834
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:50,463
See, you know what really
pisses me off about my dad?

835
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:53,716
He did all these great things then.

836
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:56,385
Before he was my dad.

837
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:58,804
Now he's just an asshole.

838
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:00,765
Hey! Hey!

839
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:02,683
Listen to me.

840
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:06,645
Your father would catch a bullet
for you. Don't you forget that.

841
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,272
He's a standup guy.

842
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:10,983
I don't know.

843
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:12,651
Not to me, he's not.

844
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:15,821
Well, I do know. And I know
what kind of a man he is.

845
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:19,533
Don't ever forget it.

846
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:26,207
Uncle Pussy? What's the matter?

847
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:28,918
Nothing.

848
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:39,762
Now go enjoy your party.

849
00:51:39,971 --> 00:51:43,307
Make your parents happy.
You got your health, your family...

850
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:47,311
...enjoy it while you can.
While you got it all in your hand.

851
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:48,813
Come here.

852
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:50,314
Give Uncle Pussy a hug.

853
00:51:51,399 --> 00:51:52,566
And get out of here.

854
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:06,330
Hey.

855
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:08,541
Hey, he's down there.

856
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,797
Where the fuck you been?

857
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:16,257
It's for AJ.

858
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:19,718
I got one son and you miss
his confirmation?

I figure with all my sins
I don't want the Church caving in.

860
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:26,308
Hey!

861
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:32,815
On the fucking rag again.

862
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:35,943
I'm on the rag.
She's wondering who the fuck you are.

863
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:38,237
No lectures. I'm not in the mood.

864
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:39,822
I agree.

865
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:43,367
I'm gonna go back
and be with my guests.

866
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:45,244
In 10 minutes I'll look up.

867
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:49,081
If you're gone, I'll assume you
went to look for what's calling you...

868
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:51,709
...and that I will never
see you again.

869
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:59,049
If you're here, I'll assume you have
no other desire but to be with me...

870
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:03,179
...and your actions will show it every
fucking second of every fucking day.

871
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:05,931
Now you understand me?

873
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,225
Don't answer me.

874
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:10,519
Take the 10 minutes.

875
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:12,188
You think about it.

876
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:17,151
Hey, you!

877
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,611
Come here.

878
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:22,156

- AJ, come on.
- Over there.

882
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:15,960

883
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:18,087
Yeah, where's the godfather?
