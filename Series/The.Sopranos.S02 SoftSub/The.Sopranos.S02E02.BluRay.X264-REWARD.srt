00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:52,402
(BUZZER)

3
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:16,468
Three weeks to let me visit?

4
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:20,514
Be careful. These motherless fucks
listen to everything.

5
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:25,102
A nephew's visiting his uncle,
who loves him.

6
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:26,854
I got nothing to say.

7
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,940
So many tragedies to those
close to you, huh?

8
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,611
Don't be so smart. Things could
have gone the other way, nephew.

9
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,321
Yeah, but they didn't.

10
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:41,201
What's this shit I'm hearing
about your heart?

11
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:45,372
This problem you and me had...

12
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,625
...your mother had nothing
to do with it.

13
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,004
- She's dead to me.
- She's a sick woman.

14
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:56,008
Who are you kidding?
It kills you that people are talking.

15
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:59,428
That an old woman
made an ass out of you.

16
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:03,724
Not half so bad as certain rumors
floating around about you.

17
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:08,395
How Tony Soprano fluffs his mother's
pillow so she can get her sleep.

18
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:12,274
- Who said that?
- Want to make this nonsense disappear?

19
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:17,196
Make peace with her. No bad blood.
It'll be good for all of us.

20
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:18,655
No fucking way.

21
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:25,037
Tell Bacala to come out of his hole.
I want to see him tomorrow.

22
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,830
What for?

23
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,671
Black men industrialized the North,
but we still fight for jobs.

24
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,048
That's right!

25
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:41,303
Over 25 joint-fitters on this site,
not a black man to be found.

26
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,890
- Tell it, reverend! Why?
- I'll tell you why.

27
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:48,936
Black joint-fitters have been
shut out of the unions.

28
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:50,729
Yeah! That's right!

29
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:54,274
Out of work while their
white joint-fitter...

30
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:55,609
...fills his stomach.

31
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,656
My father put his life on the line
for this country.

32
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:02,824
Come on up here, Papa.

33
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:07,746
Somebody help my papa on up here.
This is my papa!

34
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,874
Fought in World War II,
against tyranny.

35
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:15,295
Came home to establish
his own tabernacle.

36
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:19,132
But when he came home... I said,
when he came home...

37
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:22,552
...he had to fight a different
kind of war all over again!

38
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,889
Talk to them, Papa! Talk
to the people, Papa!

39
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:34,648
Since then, we have spilled
our blood in Korea...

40
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,441
...Vietnam and Iraq.

41
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,948
Every time, I say, "Sweet Jesus,
let them do right when they get back."

42
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,701
But somebody forgot to tell the Man.

43
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,956
- You know what I mean!
- Tell him, reverend!

44
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,125
Oh, yes, I'm gonna tell him!

45
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:57,587
I'm gonna tell him, no more cutting
us out of the dream!

46
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:58,797
No more!

47
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,091
- No more!
- No more!

48
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:02,426
(CROWD)
No More!

49
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:06,763
You hear that, Mr. Massarone
Brothers Construction?

50
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:09,641
No more!

51
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,185
- Somebody tell me what we want!
- Jobs!

52
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,979
- When do we want it?
- Now!

53
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:15,522
- What do we want?
- Jobs!

54
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:18,984
Hey, Med!

55
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:22,946
I'm gonna visit "She who
can't be named." Want to come?

56
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:25,574
Grandma? You mean like now?

57
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:29,911
I'd really like to, but I gotta study
my French. Stupid verbs.

58
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:31,580
No biggie.

59
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:34,124
Hey! I want to talk to you.

60
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:40,047
What were you doing with that sign?

61
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:44,718
- I wanted to talk to you about that.
- I'm selling Ma's house, understand?

62
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,220
Now put the sign back in the ground!

63
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,306
End of discussion! Period!

64
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,475
You're so left-brained.

65
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:56,813
The house is still for sale.
The agent still has a listing.

66
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,566
What was the sign doing in your car?

67
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:03,612
- Don't try to deny it!
- I'm trying to save a little money.

68
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,614
Do you remember Cathy Fiola?

69
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,158
She was in my class,
with the birthmark.

70
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:12,496
- What about her?
- She's in real estate and charges...

71
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:15,582
...three percent commission.
That's half, Tony.

72
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:19,878
Thousands of dollars.
Maybe Ma could use it.

73
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,922
Yeah? Fuck her!

74
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:26,885
Next time you disappear,
park that piece of shit on the street!

75
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,512
This isn't a hotel!

76
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:37,062
We're out of cran-apple.
Is plain apple okay?

77
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,274
Oh, sure, doll. Oh, honey?

78
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:45,320
Could you get me some
strawberry ice cream?

79
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:48,365
They can't expect me to eat
this tapioca.

80
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,409
I'll see what I can do.

81
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,954
She cracks me up.

82
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:57,457
Well, I can't believe it.

83
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,168
It's my daughter from California!

84
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:03,213
- Seattle, Ma.
- Would you like some of my tapioca?

85
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:08,135
- Good morning.
- Oh, you reek of cigarettes. Ugh!

86
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,556
Look at you, all dressed, out of bed.

87
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:16,476
Yeah, but you see my hand?
It's all black and blue...

88
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:20,063
...where they stuck in the needle.
It's how you get better.

89
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:24,609
You don't care.
You weren't here five minutes.

90
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:30,490
I went to the city for a few days.
I'm pitching my self-help video.

91
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:35,704
"Lady Kerouac," or, "Packing for
the Highway to a Woman's Self-Esteem."

92
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:40,792
You could never stand it here.
You could never stand yourself.

93
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:45,755
- And that's why you ran away.
- Let's not go there today, Ma.

94
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,175
You think it was easy for me?

95
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:52,345
- You don't know how your father was!
- What do you mean?

96
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:56,141
Nobody knows!
Nobody knows what I went through.

97
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,976
What about Daddy?

98
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:05,066
One thing I could tell you.
It would kill him to see me now.

99
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,320
Here's your ice cream.
Then we can take our walk.

100
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,156
Leave me alone, please.

101
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,993
Open the window and just
push me out.

102
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:18,747
- I can't take this anymore.
- Mrs. Soprano, what's wrong?

103
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:21,291
- What happened?
- She just started crying.

104
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,585
You! I know why you're here!

105
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,879
You don't fool me for a second!

106
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:29,841
- You want to take my house!
- Ma!

107
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,511
You don't know
what goes through my mind.

108
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:37,724
- Well, that's for fucking sure!
- Someday, I hope you have children...

109
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:41,353
...and they treat you like this.

110
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:47,817
- I gave my life to my children.
- This is bullshit.

111
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:54,991
Talk to me.

112
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:59,412
These activists, they're killing me.
They're picketing my place 24-7.

113
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,206
Three days I'm down.

114
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:04,251
- Who?
- A hard-on, Reverend Herman James, Jr.

115
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:07,420
"Not enough minorities
doing the joint-fitting."

116
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:11,216
- That's under my uncle's jurisdiction.
- I know.

117
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:14,844
But you could talk to him,
maybe send some guys down...

118
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,430
...and make it uncomfortable
for these people.

119
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:21,226
- Like you did, with your unions.
- It's gonna cost you.

120
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:24,521
You're already raping me
with those no-show jobs.

121
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:28,692
You're not such a citizen
when you want a bid to go your way.

122
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,360
Take it easy.

123
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:35,365
I'll see what I can do.
In the meantime, call animal control.

124
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:37,951
Watch you don't get followed
meeting me.

125
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,009
You're late.

126
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:58,680
Bobby Baccalieri,
the last man standing.

127
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,892
- I'm not saying nothing.
- Don't want to get in trouble.

128
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:06,855
A lot of funerals in your corner
of the world, huh?

129
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,983
Fucking our boost, what, you refinance
your house?

130
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,777
Look at me, not the floor.

131
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:18,783
Talk to that bald cocksucker
who calls himself my father's brother.

132
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:23,246
Tell him I'm gonna let him keep on
earning. Subsistence level.

133
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,625
He'll be able to pay his lawyers.

134
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:29,753
Let me say for him, thank you.

135
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:35,717
You're gonna hear some high-end shit.
And A: I hope you understand it...

136
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:40,013
...and B: I hope you keep it
between this room and Junior.

137
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:45,018
If you don't, they're gonna find
pieces of you in different dumpsters.

138
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:47,312
I inherited Junior.

139
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:51,983
You got no reason to talk to me
this way. I always liked you.

140
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,986
Bullshit.
But we'll assume you do now.

141
00:10:56,864 --> 00:11:00,367
Tell my uncle he gets to keep 5%.
5% of his shy...

142
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:03,495
...the sports betting.
Same with the coke.

143
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,915
The Joint-Fitters Union,
it's all his, okay?

144
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,959
Listen. This is very important.

145
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,129
He also gets to keep his stripes.

146
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:17,550
As far as the feds are concerned,
they've got the boss in jail.

147
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,969
Hearing different creates confusion.

148
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:21,721
Got it.

149
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:25,058
As far as the rest of everything
that Junior owned...

150
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,893
...it's now mine.

151
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,357
I'll get this to him, Tony.

152
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:34,234
That's it.

153
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:44,536
"To the victor belongs the spoils."

154
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:48,790
Get out of here before I shove
your quotations book up your fat ass!

155
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:59,050
Mr. Bompensiero, is your wife
here to drive you home?

156
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,553
Skip.

157
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:08,435
Skip?

158
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:18,361
- How we feeling?
- Fucking great.

159
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:22,031
He's gonna be out of it
for an hour or so.

160
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:26,494
It went great. You'll feel the
difference in your back in a few days.

161
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,872
Buzz me when he feels ready to leave.

162
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:34,169
Yeah, we'll buzz you, honey.
Buzz. Buzz. Buzz...

163
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,508
My back don't feel one iota different.

164
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,095
It'll take a couple of days
for the steroids to kick in.

165
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:46,222
I gotta get in my Jacuzzi.

166
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,850
Too much stress in your life, Sal.

167
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:52,896
- Tony doesn't know you're back yet?
- Jesus Christ, no.

168
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,898
I didn't go see him yet.

169
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:58,401
- You're all alike.
- We've seen guys drag their dicks.

170
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:02,822
Take advantage of the government's
generosity, playing both ends.

171
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,158
Will you give me a window over here?

172
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:08,119
He's already suspicious.
I gotta be careful.

173
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,163
Altieri ate the pill for you.

174
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:13,708
Any suspicions went to the grave
with Jimmy Altieri.

175
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:18,129
- I've known Tony 30 years, now this?
- Spare me, okay?

176
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,173
You been on our tit since '98.

177
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:23,802
Chauffeur to and from the doctor
that we found for you.

178
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:27,305
We let you back on the street.
We want results.

179
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,225
He tried to suffocate his own mother.

180
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,145
His own uncle wanted him whacked.

181
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:37,273
You said he's been shitting on you
for years.

182
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:40,777
- I know what I said.
- Plus he's been crying to a shrink.

183
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,403
You don't owe him dick.

184
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:46,449
Don't take a bullet for a yuppie
who thinks you're his errand boy.

185
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:53,957
Your Honor, this man should not be
released for medical reasons.

186
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:57,210
Every time we get an elder
Mafioso incarcerated...

187
00:13:57,461 --> 00:14:00,213
...we get the same bag of tricks.
Your Honor.

188
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:05,093
I take offense at the characterization
of my client as a Mafioso.

189
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:08,221
Mr. Soprano has not been found
guilty of anything.

190
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:11,182
- He's awaiting trial for allegations.
- Noted.

191
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:14,644
With all due respect to the state's
medical facilities...

192
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:18,898
...in his condition,
Mr. Soprano has every right...

193
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,818
...to seek the best medical care
he can afford.

194
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:26,614
Mr. Soprano has a benign illness.
A few clogged arteries, Your Honor.

195
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,909
I'm leaning towards releasing
this man from lockup.

196
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:33,580
Unless you can demonstrate
a serious flight risk.

197
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,749
Mr. Soprano.

198
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:40,587
If I approve this, you will
be under house arrest.

199
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,505
You understand this concept?

200
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,340
Not really.

201
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:49,554
It means that you must remain
in your residence. You cannot leave.

202
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:53,725
Except for doctor's appointments,
food shopping.

203
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:57,729
Your Honor, the government asks
for an electronic bracelet.

204
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:01,983
Your Honor, while we certainly agree
to house arrest...

205
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,861
...we are asking that Mr. Soprano...

206
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:09,073
...not be further persecuted
for yet-to-be-proven allegations.

207
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:13,036
He shows no prior arrest since 1968.

208
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:17,749
He pays his taxes and he's a veteran
of the Second World War.

209
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,587
Mr. Soprano, do you have any problem
with wearing an electronic bracelet?

210
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,173
It sounds like Nazi Germany to me.

211
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,969
Obviously you need
a history lesson, sir.

212
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,388
I don't think that we, you and I...

213
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,558
...should let our shared sorrow
or biases...

214
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,310
...enter into this, judge.

215
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,687
He's wearing a bracelet...

216
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:43,566
...to avoid any risk of flight.

217
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,111
(BUZZER)

218
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,460
- Who are you?
- Jesus, you scared the shit out of me.

219
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:05,338
Jesus ain't got nothing
to do with it.

220
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,590
What do you want?

221
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:10,385
I'm looking for your son.
Is he around?

222
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,054
- You a friend?
- Is he around?

223
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,556
He'll be back here soon.

224
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,936
Well, come on in.

225
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,700
You were a good-looking guy
back then.

226
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:39,330
Still am. Still got the same teeth
as in that picture.

227
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:40,999
Oh, yeah?

228
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:46,879
Go ahead and laugh. That picture
was taken 57 years ago.

229
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,548
So that makes you...

230
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,467
- Old.
- Come on. How old are you?

231
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,762
- 75.
- Add eight more and you got it.

232
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,682
83.
Get the fuck out of here!

233
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:02,061
- What do you want with my son?
- Gotta discuss a little business.

234
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,147
If you say so.

235
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,567
So you're 28 years old
when World War II starts.

236
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,986
That's a little long in the tooth.

237
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:15,033
In '43 they was taking everyone,
no matter how old or ugly.

238
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:20,955
They even took a fat boy I knew.
He was already 34.

239
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,167
Wasn't no good to nobody,
except he could cook.

240
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:27,503
I swear he was more dangerous
with that...

241
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,797
...stove than he was with that rifle.

242
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,175
You ever watch the History Channel?

243
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:35,053
- Television?
- No, the History Channel.

244
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:39,057
I think you'd like it.
They even do a lot of that Bible shit.

245
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:42,518
Only shit in the Bible came out
of Pharaoh's ass...

246
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,812
...when Moses parted the Red Sea.

247
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:49,150
Parted the Red Sea, praise his name.

248
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:53,654
Never underestimate a man's
determination to be free.

249
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,874
I'll come back at another time.

250
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,724
Break it, you pay for it.

251
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:35,404
If I'd known you were getting out, I
wouldn't have talked to that calzone.

252
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,573
He gave me the message.

253
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:43,412
Well, don't fucking pout.
Be grateful I'm letting you earn.

254
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,125
What's on your mind?

255
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,711
How'd you swing this?

256
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:56,134
- Dr. Schreck, he's Monty's kid.
- The bookie's son is a cardiologist?

257
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:01,514
- It's not bad.
- Feds can't bug your doctor's office.

258
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:04,225
Lets me use this place sometimes.

259
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:06,978
To conduct business.

260
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,689
You hear about Massarone Construction?

261
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:14,360
Bacala is taking care of it.
They know he speaks for me.

262
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:19,073
- It's gotta go 60-40, my way.
- Did you do what I asked?

263
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,785
- What did you ask me to do?
- You know, make peace.

264
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:27,415
Listen, that's enough with that shit.
That woman is dead to me.

265
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,541
You let it go!

266
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,795
Why? She's my brother's wife.
She doesn't realize half the time.

267
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:35,464
Let's put our cards on the table.

268
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:39,218
I heard the tapes the feds made
at Green Grove.

269
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:42,889
So she's crazy half the time.
Which half did you listen to?

270
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:47,351
The half that makes no sense, or
the half that played you like a child?

271
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:51,898
Nobody played me. She didn't know
she was setting you up to get popped.

272
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:56,319
That's right! Your uncle
isn't as dumb as you think!

273
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,905
You and that miserable fuck, Altieri.

274
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,741
All of my capos
meeting behind my back!

275
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,744
Now you let sleeping dogs lie, okay?

276
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,538
I have my reasons.

277
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:11,876
I'll tell you one dog you left
barking, that fucking Freddie Capuano.

278
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:16,130
That motherless, money grubbing
little son of a bitch that runs a...

279
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,507
The guy who owns Green Grove?

280
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,135
He's like an old lady, going around...

281
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:24,347
...telling Soprano business
to anybody who'll listen!

282
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,516
He's the one saying you tried
to whack your mother.

283
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:32,647
Even implied that me and her...
That hairpiece motherfucker!

284
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:46,619
Did everybody take a vow of silence?
Got anything to report?

285
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,538
I gotta write a report
on DNA for biology.

286
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,707
Isn't that interesting?

287
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,794
I just saw, on Inside Edition...

288
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:59,006
...how there will be no more
unknown soldiers because of DNA.

289
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:04,387
- They can identify all casualties.
- Pass me some more of that macaroni.

290
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:09,600
Tony, I know you don't like
to talk about her but...

291
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,520
...that woman is impossible.

292
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:17,108
She's a complete narcissist.
I mean, "me, me, me."

293
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:21,821
Really, kudos. You are a saint.

294
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:24,615
You're right, I don't want
to talk about it.

295
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,492
You talking about Grandma?

296
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:32,331
She pushes those buttons.
She's a big baby, you know?

297
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,047
Excusez-Moi.

298
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,133
Tony.

299
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:46,012
This is my house.
How many times I gotta say it?

300
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,681
Thank you, II Duce.

301
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,934
Got something to say,
"the little girl who might...

302
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:55,479
...want to use one of those cars
in the next 100 years"?

303
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,733
It's my fault, Med.

304
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,944
I was insensitive to his feelings.

305
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:05,531
Thank you.

306
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:09,952
You see that?
See how easy that was?

307
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,830
So, Mr. Delegated Power of Attorney...

308
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:14,874
...have you given it any thought?

309
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:19,003
Can my girlfriend have the listing?
To the house?

310
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,797
As long as it gets sold...

311
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,258
...I don't give a fuck who lists it.

312
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:30,097
- What did one prick say to the other?
- You see that?

313
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:33,059
You see what happens with you
cursing at the dinner table?

314
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,937
Thanks. It's hard to find people
over 25 to drive with.

315
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:21,482
Don't tell them you drove me
to buy pot. Which should be legal.

316
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:25,903
Only thing that works for my hands.
Med, wasn't that a stop sign?

317
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:29,323
I hate the way he talks to you.
It's so obnoxious.

318
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:33,077
He's insecure. He's afraid
to leave New Jersey...

319
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:36,789
...and threatened by freedom.
It's too pathetic.

320
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:39,250
How about Grandma in that center?

321
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:42,920
I'm dying to go see her, but
I've had so much homework...

322
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:47,299
...plus community service I have
to do to get into a good college.

323
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,552
I bring food to homeless shelters.

324
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,554
You know Grandma pretty well?

325
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:53,264
I guess.

326
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:54,890
What is she into?

327
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:59,728
- I don't know. Negativity?
- But seriously.

328
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:03,732
There must be something.
Isn't there anything she likes doing?

329
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:07,528
My dad used to find her these
old records, these sisters.

330
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:14,034
Oh, the De Castro Sisters, right.

331
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,745
The Andrew Sisters would've
been too easy.

332

Did you see me on TV?

337
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:45,232
- You were on TV? What show?
- The evening news.

338
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:49,236
Oh, yeah, that. What about it?

339
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:52,239
Well, how'd I look? Be honest.

340
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:56,494
You looked, you know, like you.
You looked good.

341
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,039
I didn't like the way I looked.

342
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:06,545
Maybe I should get new frames,
what do you think?

343
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:08,380
What's wrong with them?

344
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:14,720
- How much did those frames cost?
- Insurance pays.

345
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:18,224
- I never see the bill.
- Nice country.

346
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:23,103
- I got cataracts.

of a place to live.

To deprive me of my chance
to make peace with my mother.

You know what? Take her.
You can have her.

507

The two of you in that house deserve
each other. It's worth watching.

It'll be like
"Whatever Happened to Baby Janice?"

509
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:31,623
I'll give you your DNR!

510
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:37,963
Mom, I can't find the keys.

511
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:40,632
Keys to what? To the car?

512
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:44,678
You got a license to drive, not
carouse around on a school night.

513
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:47,597
I was going to take Anthony
to visit Grandma.

514
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:50,767
You said we could visit.
You can drive if you want.

515
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:53,353
Now you want to visit Grandma?

516
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,105
Can we, Mom?

517
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:01,569
No funny business.
You go to the hospital and back.

Check the mileage if you want. God!

Go ahead, I'll be back later.

- Hunter's upstairs.

521

That's not fair.

- I'm telling.

Anthony, come over here!
Give your Grandma a kiss.

Ah...

I thought you were Janice.

She comes over every day
to play pinochle with me.

Daughters take better care
of their mothers, that's why.

532
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:06,134
She's home, I think.

533

You didn't ride over here on your
bicycle in the dark?

534

No, Meadow drove me.

535
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:16,811
Meadow? Well, where is she?

536
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,439
- I don't know.
- She's another one.

537
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:21,983
They don't care about you, Johnny.

538
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:25,612
No, they stick you away
and forget you ever existed.

Don't they season everything?

00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:54,849
Absolutely. So, what we're gonna do
is, I got a little cayenne pepper.

Grandma, what's DNR?

547
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:00,438
- Who?
- DNR, it's initials. Like...

548
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,399
...I did a report on DNA...

549
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,902
...but Dad and Aunt Parvati
was talking about your DNR.

550
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:08,029
So is that, like, similar?

- They were talking about me?
- About your DNR.

553
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:20,375
Cause that's what's confusing.
Like, DNA, everybody's got that.

554
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:23,378
She thinks I should have a DNR?

555
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,755
Or that Dad should give it to you.

556
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:28,216
Because, what if you went into a coma?

557
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:32,429
But DNA doesn't prevent comas,
does it?

558
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:36,683
I don't know.
I gotta do this report by Monday.

00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:22,440
What do you want, a piggyback?

678
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:24,442
Get the door.

679
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:26,569
Anthony!

680
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:29,822
Don't let me go to my grave
with this guilt.

681
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:32,867
Listen, you old prick.
You're not going anywhere.

682
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:36,162
Make things right with your mother.
Please.

683
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:43,044
