In the olden time
the Sibylla of Cumae

765
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:27,932
was the second most
important oracle after Delphi.

766
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:30,810
I thought Delphi was in Greece.

767
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,603
The Greeks were here.

768
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:36,190
Way before the Romans,
and before the Greeks

769
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:39,902

and before them somebody else.

Let's go into the cave.

00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:25,656
The Sibyl sat way back there,
see that shaft of light?

779
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:29,452
Some fucking trip.

780
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:35,666

in most case.

Tell you right now you remind me

786
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:54,352
of somebody from back home.

787
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:58,189

to answer your question.

has been overrated a little bit.
