- No.

- I didn't get a good look at him.

they were firecrackers.

- Did you say you'd go?

170
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:18,153
- Please.
- All right, procrastinate.

171
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:22,490
Let me get our ducks in a row.
Keep your cool and go the speed limit.

172
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,242
Don't give them an in.

173
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,245
What'd I just say?

174
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,792
- Don't give them an in.
- Are you all right, Tony?

175
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,131
This is some bad shit here.

176
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:41,760
What's up, Anthony?
How did this happen?

177
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,095
Midlife crisis?
You can talk to me.

178
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:51,478
The mothers last year said we should
end senior night at Long Beach Island.

179
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:55,440
They'll dance, scavenger hunt and
the liquor stores will be closed.

180
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,442
- And we count noses.
- Okay.

181
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:00,945
Is that the time? I'm gonna
barely get Natalie to tap.

182
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,865
- Chris, need a ride?
- No, my brother's coming.

183
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:07,202
- Eric took my car to a meet.
- Next week, my house.

184
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:09,078
We'll tie up the loose ends.

185
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:31,643
- Christine, I'm so glad you stayed.
- I kind of wanted to.

186
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:35,814
When I found out about Eric's car,
I told Tony to give it back...

187
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:40,026
I wish I could say this is
a first for David, but...

188
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:49,118
Eric is going to college,
and maybe it's better for his grades.

189
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:54,958
- So April 1, huh? How I dread it.
- So long as Eric gets into Georgetown.

190
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:59,546
- It's his first choice.
- Meadow wants to go to Berkeley.

191
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:07,804
- Hi. We just finished.
- Sorry I'm late. I was bidding a job.

192
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:11,641
My brother, the wallpaper artist.
The one you can trust...

193
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:15,728
...with your Brunswick & Fields.
Vic, Carmela Soprano. Victor Musto.

194
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,689
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

195
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,358
- You have a beautiful house.
- Thank you.

196
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:24,571
- Could use a little freshening up.
- Vic does amazing border work too.

197
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:29,617
I was thinking of wallpapering
the dining room. Do you have a card?

198
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,619
Yeah, sure.

199
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:36,249

but I'm still dangerous.

00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:42,213
- Well, bye, Carmela. Thanks.
- Let's get together and have lunch.

202
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,549
- Have you tried the new Vesuvio?
- No.

203
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,093
- Okay, lunch. Promise.
- Yes.

204
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:53,766
- Nice meeting you.
- I'll call about the wallpaper.

00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:05,862
Don't even think about it.
She's married to Tony Soprano.

208
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:11,868
Married's good enough. The husband
doesn't matter, I respect the ring.

209
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:15,246

- What are you doing?
- Fixing the fucking light bulb!

- It glares off the ball when I rack!
- Jesus, okay.

- Where'd that come from?
- What?

00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:46,170
"It should be you"?
What are you trying to say, Janice?

- What?
- Don't "what" me!

- Oh, Jesus, Richie.

- Breast cancer.

a sadness about him.

321

- And the children?
- Childless. She had a hostile womb.

- I had a dream about him.
- You did?

323

- Christine.
- He asked me about you too.

00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,143
He was wallpapering my dining room.

325

you want him to wallpaper the room.

- Thanks.
- Wanted it for Christmas, remember?

00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:26,964
But it was back-ordered?
Well, I got a great deal on it.

- We'll take the boat and go fishing.
- Okay.

332
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:33,512
- What are you doing now?
- You want to go fishing now?

or something...

334
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:39,143
...get some pizza.
I can't.

335
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:41,812
- What do you mean?
- I'm going to the mall.

336
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:46,692
- You gotta go to the mall?
- Not just me.

337
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:50,988
- Brad, Allen, Heidi, her sister maybe.
- Like a double date.

338
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:57,036
No, Dad. We're just going
to the mall. We go there sometimes.

339
00:24:57,245 --> 00:25:01,457
- And do what?
- Get something to eat. Mrs. Fields.

340
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:04,793
Anyway, I gotta go.
I'm meeting them there.

341
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,922
All right. Go ahead.

342

344
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:16,555
Yeah, my girl did the same thing...

345
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:20,226
...at his age. Boys and girls,
always in a group.

346
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:23,395
- What's that about?
- What's it about for you?

347
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,524
In my day, a boy and girl
went on a date.

348
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:30,236
Your father hoped you wouldn't get
too far or you'd knock her up...

349
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:32,696
...and her parents would
break your legs.

350
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:37,451
I don't think it's about him
going to the mall with a group...

351
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,245
...that bothered you.

352
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:43,290
Wasn't it that he went to the mall
instead of going with you?

353
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:48,796
- He's starting to get his own life.
- One that doesn't include you.

354
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:53,425
It was always, "We'll do this."
"We're gonna do that."

355
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:57,555
I've heard you talk many times
about being with your son.

356
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:01,141
Well, that's over now. Gone. Done.

357
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,602
It's bittersweet, this period.

358
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:07,898
You're glad that they're growing up,
but you're sad to lose them.

359
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,413
I could be going away.

360
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,499
For a very long time.

361
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:28,836
For something I didn't do.

362
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:36,427
How about, "That's too bad"?
Or, "What a shame, Tony"?

363
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:40,514
- We can't go into specifics on this.
- Here's something specific.

364
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:43,684
I didn't do anything wrong.
We can't talk about it?

365
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:47,021
I could be going to the can
for the rest of my life...

366
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:50,608
...and I'm not supposed to
discuss it with my psychiatrist?

367
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:53,193
What the fuck are you for anyway?

368
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,365
How does that feel?

369
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:01,285
The idea that you might
be sent to prison?

370
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:12,838
I gotta stay around a little
while longer for the kids.

371
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,800
Especially my boy.

372
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:22,348

the government can do what they want.

373
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:27,144
- Give me life, the chair, whatever.
- I've never seen you like this.

374
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:28,979
- Like what?
- Scared.

375
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,485
I wouldn't use that word.

376
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:39,198
But sometimes I feel...
I don't know, I don't know.

How are you guys doing?
Ready for another sandwich?

506
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:39,441
- You ought to go into business.
- Oh, stop it.

507
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:41,651
Thank you, no, Mrs. Carmela.

508
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:48,366
I thought you might want this.
You said Ramone backed over yours.

509
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:49,659
I lied.

510
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:53,538
I smelled those sausages
and I wanted you to make me lunch.

511
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:57,292
Guess I'm hungry
for a home-cooked meal.

512
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:00,962
My wife was a gourmet cook.

513

Christine told me about her.
I'm so sorry.

00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:06,843
Thank you.

We were talking
about the powder room?

516
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:18,355
- Do you have a minute to look at it?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

closes the room in.

I see what you mean.
It's the vertical striping.

520

Somebody even talked me into
papering the back of the door here.

I must have been out of my mind.

522

It's a lot for the eye to handle
in such a confined space.

523
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:55,266
So, what do you think? Should I
just paint or do something plain-ish?

- I couldn't help it.
- I never felt like this before.

- It won't happen again.
- Of course not.

- Cock.

to sit back and watch...

- I forgot already.

- Now he's fucking with mine?
- What should I do?

- I'm under indictment.
- I don't want to open old wounds...

- You're in no shape for disharmony.
- You and I both know he's gotta go.

- Your aunt forgot to lock that door.
