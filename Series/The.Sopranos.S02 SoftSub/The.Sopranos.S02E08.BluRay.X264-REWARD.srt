Hunter got into Reed.

00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:54,196
- Sayonara!
- Can't you be happy for Hunter?

4
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:57,574
It's her first choice.
She'd die if she didn't get in.

5
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,952
Why do you think everything
has to do with me?

6
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,328
Because you didn't get in.

7
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:04,248
Anthony! Nobody is hearing
anything for months.

8
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:07,126
Hunter took early acceptance
to find out early.

9
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:09,670
That meant she could only
apply to one college.

10
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,839
Your sister has a lot of options.

11
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,301
Such as: Bowdoin, Holy Cross,
Georgetown...

12
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,428
Georgetown is a reach for me.

13
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,681
They'd be crazy not to want you.

14

I can get into Berkeley.

- There are more...

...Nobel Prize winners in the
San Francisco area than anywhere.

17
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,316
Nobel Prize for what? Packing fudge?

18

You know that you can go anywhere
you want to go to college.

19
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,366
But I'm not gonna pay for Berkeley.

20
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,660
I want to go to Harvard or West Point.

You may get to see them on TV,
but that's about it.

Big Pussy Bompensiero,
he started out as a cat burglar.

34
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:35,422
One time he left a load so big,
cop thought a bear did it.

35

Bompensiero started off
chipping safes like this?

36
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,929
Until he stepped up for Soprano
during the unrest of '83.

37
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,932
Back then when you did something,
you got recognized.

When your time comes, you either
step up or you look for a new career.

Is she trying to get away from us?

Absolutely. That's her job.

...to write Meadow a recommendation.
Is that too much?

But she doesn't really know Meadow.

- Ma...

00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,578
Open it.

141
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,080
I bet it was in Zane's window
this morning.

142
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,499

of broken glass in it.

00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,898
Fucking winghead came to see me.

170
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,859
Paulie?

171
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:20,447
He said I gotta build a fucking ramp
on Beansie's house.

172
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:24,409
- Yeah, I know.
- Wait, this was your idea?

173
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:29,456
Jesus Christ, Tony.
Is this how you spend your time?

174
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,958
Beansie Gaeta would still
sell nickel bags...

175
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,545
...on Jefferson Avenue if it
wasn't for Jackie.

176
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,756
Build Beansie the ramp.

177
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:41,092
Terrible accident that kid had.

178
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,263
Yeah, it's done.

179
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,557
Come on, come here.

180
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,519
I got something for you.

181
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:02,447
- What's this?
- What's this? It's the jacket!

182
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,908
- The jacket?
- The jacket...

183
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:08,578
...I took off Rocco DiMeo.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

184
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,164
Toughest reputation
in Essex County.

185
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,833
Didn't come back after
I finished with him.

186
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,961
- He later died of Alzheimer's.
- Oh, yeah?

187
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:20,673
- Try it on.
- It's your fucking jacket.

188
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:24,677
You love this jacket. You and my
brother would've killed for it.

189
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,472
Silk lining. Fine Corinthian leather.

190
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:31,142
Nobody believed with my size I could
carry this jacket.

191
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,353
But with a belt, it was like Rommel.

192
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:34,771
It's a...

193
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,315
...nice jacket.

194
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,901
It's a beautiful jacket.

195
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,778
But it's yours to have now.

196
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:44,113
- Why?
- I gotta let go of the past.

197
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:49,494
Like the Tao says, you gotta shut
one door before another one can open.

198
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,916
Was that so hard to do? You did it.

199
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:03,258
That's it. That's it. Oh!

200
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,177
Huh? Perfect.

201
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,305
You look like Robert Evans over there.

202
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,565
Thanks.

203
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:12,619
Is that all Tony said?
Did he say anything else?

204
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,579
What do you want him to do?

205
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:18,458
Give you a kiss? He said
nice swag, and where's his end?

206
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,044
To kick up to Tony Soprano
will be an honor.

207
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,462
He the man.

208
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:26,799
Thought you said I was the man.
He the man, who the man?

209
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,593
Are we not men?

210
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:39,187
Oh, listen. Tony's cut from this
thing and that one...

211
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,565
...comes out of your end.
That's how it is in the beginning.

212
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:45,276
Dues concept. We're down with it.
Right, Gis?

213
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,779
I laid out my take on
the diamond for Ade.

214
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:52,575
Adriana La Cerva.
There's one hottie!

215
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:55,787
She loves me and these are
her childbearing years.

216
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,580
Don't see myself getting married.

217
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:01,626
I get all I need, and I can
hire somebody to wash and iron.

218
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,753
Yeah, I could see that.

219

(FARTING)

220
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,172
No more burritos before work.

221
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:13,972
Look at this place. Can you
imagine spending day after day here...

222
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,306
...year after year?

223

(DOORBELL)

224
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,679
- Can I help you?
- Mrs. Gaeta?

225
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,431
- We're here for the ramp.
- Ramp?

226
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,932
For your husband.

227
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,143
You from Outreach at Saint Erasmus?

228
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,894
We're also supposed to...

229
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:06,482
...alter the toilets and widen the
doorways and so on...

230
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,526
...to make the house accessible.

231
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,028
Who sent you here?

232
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:15,324
- Richie Aprile.
- Richie Aprile?

233
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:18,494
We'll be done before Beansie's
home from the hospital.

234
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,328
Get out of here.

235
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:22,749
I don't want anything to do
with that man after what he did.

236
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:30,548
She's got problems, but I'm not gonna
tell Richie this isn't getting done.

(WHISTLING)

238
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:40,683
(DOORBELL)

239
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,813
- Richie.
- Tony.

240
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:49,650
Rich, this is Matthew Bevilaqua
and Sean Gismonte.

241
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,236
- From West Orange.
- I'm back to Drinkwater.

242
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,696
It's good to meet you.

243
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:57,450
My cousin Louis worked with you
in the prison sign shop.

244
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:00,703
Oh, yeah. Lou. 5'8," about 225.

245
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,915
I'll take them to Uncle Joey's
to look at IROCs.

246
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,417
They asked if they could come
and say hello.

247
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,711
You been doing things for
Christopher Moltisanti?

248
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:12,381
- This and that.
- The attitude on that camel-nose fuck.

249
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:15,176
He lays his hand on my niece again...

250
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:16,928
...I'm gonna tear him apart.

251
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:19,472
- Camel-nose.
- You can't make that shit up.

252
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:21,224
What are you talking about?

253
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:24,060
I just did. Ever notice,
he's the only guy...

254
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:27,730
...who can smoke in the rain
with his hands on his back?

255
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:30,650
That nose is a natural canopy.

256
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:37,657
- The kid has his good points.
- I know. He's my homie.

257
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,952
- Your what?
- He lives up near me.

258
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,079
Why didn't you say that?

259
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:47,750
If you talk like a melanzane,
I'll send you to slip-and-fall school.

260
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:50,002
Fellas, come on. Times up, let's go.

261
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,213
Richie, it was good meeting you.

262
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:56,259
If there's ever anything you can do
for me, let me know.

263
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,098
(DOOR OPENING)

264
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:04,934
- Hi.
- Oh, my God. Did we have a lunch?

265
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,271
- I'm rushing to a deposition.
- I was in the neighborhood.

266
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,108
- Downtown Newark?
- I think I goofed, Joanie.

267
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,610
I don't know how I got
into this conversation.

268
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,864
But Carmela Soprano, from next door,
trapped me...

269
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:22,702
...into asking you to write her kid
a recommendation to Georgetown.

270
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:25,788
- The gangster's wife?
- I'm sorry.

271
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:29,417
She blind-sided me in the back yard.
What was I supposed to say?

272
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:33,379
That I'm busy, which I am.
That I don't even know the girl.

273
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:37,175
Come on, you met Meadow.
Fourth of July, at our barbecue.

274
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,970
That's not what I mean.
You can't expect me to do this.

275
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:45,183
It's just a letter.
Bruce just wrote one to UVM.

276
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,685
You do it all the time!

277
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:51,189
Gangsters, on the Georgetown campus?
I don't think so.

278
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,482
Oh, spare me the elitist bullshit.

279
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,068
- They're neighbors!
- Have you lost your mind?

280
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,237
Carmela asked me, Joan.

281
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,948
Are you frightened?
What are they gonna do?

282
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,826
Put you in cement boots over
an application?

283
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,371
It's not that. It's about manners.
What will I say?

284
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,499
I'm writing a letter
for someone else, which I am.

285
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:14,670
A wonderful Dominican boy from
the projects, with a 5.2 average.

286
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,923
I have a reputation to protect.

287
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:22,261
- I knew you wouldn't do it.
- You want to be a doormat forever?

288
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:25,223
Just deal with it, Jeannie, okay?

289
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,229
It's no trouble at all
to add two more.

290
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,231
Especially with Ms. Meadow missing.

291
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,069
Don't be silly. We dropped by to get
Ma's furniture from the basement.

292
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,239
- "Ma," now?
- Hugh, sit with me and Anthony.

293
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:43,908
Let Janice's friend sit at the foot.

294
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,077
Grandpa, after dinner, Hot Wheels?

295
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:47,370
Ooh.

296
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:49,288
Something smells good.

297
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:52,667
It's much cozier this way.
The more the merrier.

298
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:57,046
This is what it's all about.
Friends, family.

299
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,965
It's what I missed all those years.

300
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:01,384
You are always welcome, Richie.

301
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,094
I hope you're hungry for roast.

302
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,888
- Let me help.
- Ma, sit down. Janice, sit.

303
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,266
Everything's under control.

304
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:13,521
Oh, Janice, sit. Really, sit.

305
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,357
- Hey, how's the jacket?
- What jacket?

306
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:20,152
I gave your little brother
a beautiful leather jacket.

307
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:23,447
- You still liking the jacket?
- It's terrific.

308
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:26,617
Excuse me, I gotta get the Ginzu.

309
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:28,953
- What jacket?
- With the belt.

310
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,125
Where's my knife?

311
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:37,378
I want to compliment you
on your behavior out there.

312
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,130
I want him where I can see him.

313
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:42,258
That's what we mean
when we say "family."

314
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,641
I'm sorry. I know I'm late.

315
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:53,686
Said you could stay overnight,
not miss dinner.

316
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:56,272
I said I'm sorry.
You could've paged me.

317
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:59,191
- Any mail yesterday?
- It's where it always is.

318
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,569
But go set yourself a place,
we have company.

320
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,536
What happened to this?

321
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:14,290
- Hello?
- Carmela? Hi.

322
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:18,169
- It's Jeannie Cusamano.
- Oh, hi! Hi, how are you?

323
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:21,672
Listen, Carmela.
I spoke to my sister about the letter.

324
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:25,676
And she's sorry, but she just
can't do it. I'm sorry.

325
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,720
She can't? Why not?

326
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:31,057
Because she already wrote a letter
for someone else.

327
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:34,602
A wonderful Dominican man
from the housing projects...

328
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:37,313
...with a 5.2 average and...

329
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:41,525
...crack-addict mother,
and cerebral palsy.

330
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,322
What does that mean?
She can't send two?

331
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,325
Did you think to ask one of
the priests at church?

332
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:53,287
A letter from Father Intintola would
mean more, I bet.

333
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,164
Especially at Georgetown.

334
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:58,667
I gotta go. Bye. Good luck!

335
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:02,755
Who was that?

336
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:07,093
- Can't send two what?
- It's nothing.

337
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:16,977
Joan, I don't want to interrupt you...

338
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,606
...but a Carmela Soprano is here.
You're kidding.

339
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,609
She's not in your Day-Timer.
Want me to handle it?

340
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:27,405
Oh, Christ. Send her in.

341
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:30,533
Excuse me.

342
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:33,536
Joan, hi. Is this a bad time?

343
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:36,705
Always. Come on in.

344
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,709
- Ricotta pie with pineapples.
- Oh, well.

345
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:44,296
I was in the neighborhood.
My mother's foot surgeon is here.

346
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,006
Thank you.

347
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,969
Listen, I think I know
why you're here.

348
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:55,307
My sister told me you want me to write
a letter to Georgetown for Fielder?

349
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:58,060
- Meadow.
- Oh, sorry.

350
00:23:58,603 --> 00:23:59,895
But I just can't do it.

351
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:05,234
I thought you would at least want to
look at her grades and SAT scores...

352
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:07,736
...and teacher comments
before you decide.

353
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,656
She'd be a wonderful
addition to Georgetown.

354
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:13,451
Then the admissions officers
will see that.

355
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:18,456
I'm not sure that's true. The sad
fact is, that's not enough these days.

356
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:22,334
I'm sorry, Carmela.
But I can't do it.

357
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,670
I don't think you understand.

358
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:27,631
I want you to write that letter.

359
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,760
- Excuse me?
- I want you to write the letter.

360
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,930
- Are you threatening me?
- Threat? What threatening?

361
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:38,392
I brought a pie, and a transcript
so you could write...

362
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,270
...a letter for my
daughter to Georgetown.

363
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:44,607
- I'm an officer of the court.
- A lawyer.

364
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:49,195
Don't make me beg here.

365
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:54,116
I've written my last letter of
support for this academic year.

366
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:57,745
How about this? You could
write a letter to Georgetown...

367
00:24:57,954 --> 00:25:01,457
...about discovering it
wasn't that person's first choice...

368
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,668
...and that he was using
Georgetown as a backup.

369
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,462
I'm not telling you what to write.

370
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:11,091
Oh, I left my mother
in the car with that foot.

371
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:13,677
Thanks for this.

372
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:27,358
(TONY)
Ask the kid to fix me a burger.

373
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:29,693
- Holy fuck. Shit.
- It's him.

374
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:33,822
- We should've said hello.
- Or asked him what time it was.

375
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:38,744
Think we should go in?

376
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:40,496
Wait, you got...

377
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,873
- How do I look?
- Good.

378
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,501
Your hair...

379
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:57,846
- Hi, Tony. How the fuck's it going?
- How you doing?

380
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:01,350
Matt Drinkwater. Bevilaqua's nephew.
Sean Gismonte.

381
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,270
Friends of Christopher.
Worked the card game.

382
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:06,021
I know. How you doing?

383
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:08,774
That dancer, Destinee out there?

384
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,527
I'd like to break my dick off
in her ass.

385
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:28,085
Chrissy spoke to us about it.
We should give you a taste from...

386
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,713
Jesus Christ, you stupid
shit-eating twat.

387
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,048
You ever hear of wiretaps?

388
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:38,429
- Look what you did.
- You made me do all the talking.

389
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:41,140
You always do that.
You get all quiet...

390
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,726
...you leave me hanging in
the fucking wind.

391
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:49,356
What's so important you make
a man late for the first post?

392
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,108
We heard from Gia Gaeta...

393
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:55,988
...your nephews ripped up the house
and then haven't been back there.

394
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:59,116
I needed them to do work
on Janice's mom's house.

395
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:02,786
Which, all do respect,
is also your boss's mother's house.

396
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,415
- Gentlemen.
- Ton, these guys...

397
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,585
...won't shut up about this ramp.

398
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:15,174
Richie, relax, sit down.
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

399
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:27,811
Where's the jacket?
You're not wearing the jacket.

400
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:30,314
It's in the car. You want it back?

401
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:34,109
I gave Tony a jacket I took
off Rocco DiMeo.

402
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:39,156
Cocksucker had a reputation as being
the toughest guy in Essex County.

403
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:42,701
He didn't come back when
I got through with him.

404
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:46,580
We did an interview.
She was the first celebrity...

00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,293
Oh, hi.

408
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:52,544
Hi.

409
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:53,962
Jean, hi. Come on in.

410
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:58,801
Your plate. My sister said
the ricotta pie was delicious.

411
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,469
The family loved it.

412
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,472
She also said she reviewed
Meadow's transcripts...

413
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:07,351
...and she was knocked the fuck out
by those recommendations.

414
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,145
She wrote a terrific letter
to Georgetown.

415
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,065
That's wonderful. Do you have a copy?

416
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:16,694
No, but I'll get you one. No problem.

417
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:21,073
Thank you so much.
Jean, you are a wonderful friend.

418
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:27,579
Did I tell you how impressed Joan
was with Meadow's transcripts?

419
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,498
You did, thank you.

420
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:40,884

- We're here for the money.

- Money?
- The boss's money.

Oh, the money. Okay, yeah, sure.
Sean, get out Antonio's money.

439
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,150
- Chris said 10 percent.
- One thousand dollars.

I can't believe this. You're
ripping us off. This is bullshit.

- No, I'll have a puff of yours.

- Man.
- I know.

getting better...

to marry me sooner.

down the line.

Mom, I don't believe it,
and don't deny it!

502
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:52,566
I told you not to let Lilliana
into my room!

503
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:55,527
Look at the money they waste
on these CD-ROMs.

504
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:59,239
MindSpring, Earthlink,
what are these exactly?

505
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:02,200
Don't change the subject!
It's my room!

506
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:04,661
There were clothes a foot deep
on the floor.

507
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:06,329
You had half the bath towels.

508
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:09,666
- Don't exaggerate.
- Wet! It was starting to smell.

509
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:12,377
It's my room,
and that's the way I want it!

510
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:16,506
- I don't bitch about your room!
- Your room is in my house.

511
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,675
As long as you live here,
there are limits.

512
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:21,011
I won't be here for long!
I'm 18...

513
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:24,514
...going to college. I can
take care of myself, so bug out!

514
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:27,184
- Oh, you can?
- That's right!

515
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:34,065
You know what? You're right.

516
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:37,694
You are right.
You can take care of yourself.

517
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:39,696
Thank you.

518
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:43,658
You're going off on your
own to a wonderful college.

519
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,994
What right do I have to interfere?

520
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:07,224
- What's going on?
- Nothing I can think of.

521
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:10,769
Except it's Tuesday, 3:00.

522
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:13,021
So we gotta talk about something.

523
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:18,568
Okay, spin the wheel.

524
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:23,073
Here's something that's been
bothering me.

525
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,575
- I gave my daughter a car.
- Really?

526
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:29,955
Yeah, a used car. One of those SUVs.
You know, a '92 Pathfinder.

527
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:33,333
It belonged to a friend
of hers from school.

528
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:37,504
It came into my possession because
of a debt by the kid's father.

529
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,798
This is the way he made payment.

530
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,717
You gave her her friend's car?

531
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:46,471
It was a nice, safe car to which
I had the pink slip.

532
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:47,973
What's bothering you?

533
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:52,936
I must've known she'd know that it
was this kid's car...

534
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:58,233
...and how I got it.
You know, and she'd freak out.

535
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:01,444
- Then why'd you give it to her?
- I don't know.

536
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:08,243
For all these years I been shielding
and protecting her...

537
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:10,412
...from certain truths.

538
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:16,126
- So now I want to rub her nose in it?
- Any thoughts on that?

539
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:26,386
Well, this kid's father,
he's a fucking degenerate gambler.

540
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:31,182
But also a respected businessman
in the community and so on.

541
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:34,436
- One of your "Happy Wanderers."
- How do you remember this?

542
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:40,859
So it becomes my fault
he lost his kid's car?

543
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:44,946
I gotta look out for this bastard?
My friend Artie's got a restaurant.

544
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:49,034
Now, no one's telling him
to refuse a plate of fettuccine...

545
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:52,454
...to some fat fuck wandering in
eating himself to death.

546
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:56,499
Maybe that's what you said to her.

547
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:59,294
- What?
- By giving her the SUV.

548
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:04,049
- Wanting her to confront ambiguities.
- English.

549
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:09,137
Meadow's going to be going away
to college next year.

550
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:11,973
- That's why she needs the car.
- Leaving the nest.

551
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,976
- Not those fucking ducks again.
- Maybe you were...

552
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:19,314
...preparing her for reality, to fly.
You people are something.

553
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:24,152
I give my little daughter a car
to rub her face in shit...

554
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:26,321
...and you tell me
I did something noble?

555
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:27,989
We're getting to something here.

556
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:36,081
- Times up.
- Look, we're doing good work.

557
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,501
What? You feel you're cured?

558
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:43,088
Fine, I'll sit here.
But I got nothing else to say.

559
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:55,266
Yeah. Did you call me?
Oh, get the fuck out of here.

560
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:58,561
I'm supposed to go all the way
there to check a ramp?

561
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:01,856
- Christopher, what's up?
- Hey, what's up, man?

562
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:05,777
Get that motherfucker!

563
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,616
- Get him!
- Fucking seat belt!

Matt Drinkwater, Bevilaqua.

568

Hear what happened to Christopher?

569
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:48,319
- Yeah, somebody blew him up.
- It was us. Me and Sean.

570
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:53,450
- It was what? You?
- Sean's dead. Christopher killed him.

571
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:57,245
- So, what are you doing here?
- We did it for you. A favor.

572
00:40:57,496 --> 00:41:00,081
- What are you saying?
- You don't like him.

573
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,916
- So what?
- He hit your niece.

574
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:08,923
Jesus, are you crazy?
That's all I need now for that fuck...

575
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:10,592
...to think I had a part of this.

576
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:15,430
- You gotta help me, man.
- I'll help you. I'll fucking help you!

Who told you to do that? Get out of
here, you dumb fuck! I'll kill you!

How could this happen?
