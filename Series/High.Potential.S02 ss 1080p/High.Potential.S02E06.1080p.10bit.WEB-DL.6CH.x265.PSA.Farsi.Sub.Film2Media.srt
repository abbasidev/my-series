00:08:33,202 --> 00:08:37,171
It's a symbol of protection in some
cultures, and so is that bracelet.

172
00:08:38,034 --> 00:08:41,175
Detective Karadec might not
believe in ghosts, but our victim did.

173
00:08:41,348 --> 00:08:43,419
Danny thought
his house was haunted.

174
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:44,731
[Danny screaming]

175
00:08:44,869 --> 00:08:46,615
[Morgan] <i>He was
hearing and seeing crazy things</i>

176
00:08:46,698 --> 00:08:48,838
<i>he couldn't pinpoint,
so he trashed this entire place</i>

177
00:08:48,976 --> 00:08:50,776
<i>trying to figure out
where it was coming from.</i>

178
00:08:52,221 --> 00:08:56,087
Guy had electricians, pest control,
plumbers, everyone checked this place out.

179
00:08:56,225 --> 00:08:59,228
Okay, Danny was hearing things
that go bump in the night,

180
00:08:59,366 --> 00:09:00,712
but we know it wasn't a ghost.

181
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,197
I think somebody
who knew Danny had a bad heart,

182
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:04,992
staged a haunting
to scare him to death.

183
00:09:05,855 --> 00:09:07,029
That would be murder.

184
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:08,927
All this witchy stuff
is not Danny's style.

185
00:09:09,065 --> 00:09:10,929
Somebody had to help him
set it up.

186
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:13,467
And someone who could stop a
haunt might be able to fake one.

187
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:15,416
Danny's phone
is password-protected.

188
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,418
It's gonna take TID
some time to crack it.

189
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:22,216
Oz, any of those invoices over there have
something to do with ghost remediation?

190
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:23,804
-[Oz] Um...
-[papers rustle]

191
00:09:25,841 --> 00:09:28,740
No. But there is this.

192
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,595
[Karadec] And just for my file,
the full name is Calliope...

193
00:09:35,678 --> 00:09:36,852
[Calliope] Just Calliope.

194
00:09:37,404 --> 00:09:39,095
I knew something felt off today.

195
00:09:40,234 --> 00:09:42,188
What was the nature of your
relationship with Mr. Sternblatt?

196
00:09:42,271 --> 00:09:44,238
Verbena? It's good for stress.

197
00:09:44,411 --> 00:09:47,276
Oh, thank you. We got our fill
at the crime scene.

198
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,968
I was Danny's spiritual advisor.

199
00:09:50,106 --> 00:09:53,282
He was raised in a traditional faith
and never really connected with it.

200
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:57,631
So when he reached a crossroads in
life, he preferred to ask the universe.

201
00:09:57,769 --> 00:09:59,253
Spiritual, not religious.

202
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:00,807
Would you mind?

203
00:10:00,945 --> 00:10:03,913
We did a very difficult reading
for a client this morning.

204
00:10:04,051 --> 00:10:05,397
We need time to ground.

205
00:10:06,433 --> 00:10:08,711
What sort of crossroads
did you talk about with Danny?

206
00:10:08,849 --> 00:10:12,750
Business, mostly. Managing his
law firm, sometimes investments.

207
00:10:12,888 --> 00:10:14,648
Investments like buying
the Spencer house?

208
00:10:14,786 --> 00:10:16,346
[Calliope] Especially
the Spencer house.

209
00:10:16,443 --> 00:10:18,997
He wouldn't sleep there until
I performed a clearing ritual,

210
00:10:19,135 --> 00:10:22,000
but it was his wife's dream
of dream houses.

211
00:10:22,138 --> 00:10:24,313
Sadly, the work I performed
there didn't last.

212
00:10:24,451 --> 00:10:26,867
After Lorraine left,
something dark welled up.

213
00:10:27,005 --> 00:10:30,353
So you're the one who helped him set
up all those protective elements, right?

214
00:10:30,491 --> 00:10:32,701
-Have you been in the house?
-Mm-hmm.

215
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:36,670
So you felt the cold spot in the
basement? Heard the crying woman?

216
00:10:36,808 --> 00:10:38,983
-Mmm.
-Can't say that we have. Where was this?

217
00:10:39,121 --> 00:10:41,641
In the butler's pantry.
Well, that's where I heard her.

218
00:10:41,813 --> 00:10:44,954
Danny heard her at the same time
in the sitting room across the house.

219
00:10:45,092 --> 00:10:47,508
The energy
in that place is very off.

220
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,684
Yeah. Hey, how much do each
of these clearing rituals cost?

221
00:10:50,822 --> 00:10:52,168
Around 5,000.

222
00:10:52,306 --> 00:10:54,308
-Dollars?
-Yes. Why?

223
00:10:54,481 --> 00:10:56,103
Uh... I need a minute to ground.

224
00:10:56,241 --> 00:10:58,830
What my partner's saying is it
seems you caught yourself a whale.

225
00:10:58,968 --> 00:11:01,557
Danny was terrified and
more than willing to shell out.

226
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:03,545
[chuckles] -Yeah, and
these rituals didn't work,

227
00:11:03,628 --> 00:11:05,388
but you knew that, didn't you?

228
00:11:05,526 --> 00:11:09,703
This green candle over here, you got
it just drenched in bergamot and myrtle.

229
00:11:09,841 --> 00:11:11,740
That's an abundance spell, right?

230
00:11:11,878 --> 00:11:14,156
Only typically those are done
during a waxing moon,

231
00:11:14,294 --> 00:11:15,640
and right now the moon's waning.

232
00:11:15,813 --> 00:11:17,124
You know your stuff.

233
00:11:20,507 --> 00:11:23,234
Ah. My cleaning lady
must have flipped that.

234
00:11:23,372 --> 00:11:26,444
Oh. Yeah. Yeah,
I think I do know my stuff.

235
00:11:26,582 --> 00:11:30,690
I also know that a woman who refers
to herself and her tarot deck as "we,"

236
00:11:30,828 --> 00:11:34,694
doesn't need to consult a calendar
to find out the moon phases.

237
00:11:34,832 --> 00:11:36,661
-You calling me a fraud?
-I am.

238
00:11:36,834 --> 00:11:38,097
[Karadec] So, Calliope,
what happened?

239
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,595
Did Danny catch on to your scam?

240
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:41,272
Cut off the funds,
so you scared him to death?

241
00:11:41,355 --> 00:11:43,047
[chuckles]
No, why would I do that?

242
00:11:43,219 --> 00:11:46,219
My entire business would collapse if
people found out my clients were dying.

243
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,879
Now, unless I am under arrest,

244
00:11:48,017 --> 00:11:50,433
please leave and take your
closed hearts with you.

245
00:11:50,571 --> 00:11:52,125
This is a sacred space.

246
00:11:52,263 --> 00:11:54,230
This is a bungalow
in El Segundo.

247
00:11:54,368 --> 00:11:55,749
Morgan, let's go.

248
00:11:55,887 --> 00:11:58,407
If you don't believe the
Spencer house is haunted, fine.

249
00:11:58,545 --> 00:12:00,236
But the things
I told you did happen,

250
00:12:00,374 --> 00:12:04,689
so perhaps focus less on me
and look into what caused them.

251
00:12:12,352 --> 00:12:13,802
What? She put me in a bad mood.

252
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,218
-When were you in a good mood?
-I'm a delight.

253
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:18,344
Well, fraud or no fraud,
Calliope made a good point.

254
00:12:18,427 --> 00:12:20,627
It wasn't in her best interest
to kill her golden goose.

255
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,037
And she gave us
specifics we can use.

256
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,744
A cold spot in the basement,
a woman crying.

257
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:27,056
Someone planted those scares
to freak Sternblatt out.

258
00:12:27,229 --> 00:12:28,829
And maybe they left
some evidence behind.

00:13:55,696 --> 00:14:01,116
Well, my kids used to talk to each

281
00:14:57,379 --> 00:14:58,759
What's going on? Just tell me.

-How was work?
-Pretty good.

304
00:16:00,683 --> 00:16:05,274
I helped stop a fleeing suspect
today, mostly by just standing there,

305
00:16:05,447 --> 00:16:07,035
but still, the job got done.

306
00:16:07,173 --> 00:16:09,554
She's being questioned
right now, so I had a little time.

307
00:16:09,692 --> 00:16:12,833
I thought I'd come home and get
dinner started before Ludo gets here,

308
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,283
then I gotta head back.

How were your days?
Chloe go down for her nap okay?

Uh, yeah, Ava got Chloe down,
no problem. School was the usual.

Ava was invited to a Halloween party
this weekend, and she really wants to go,

317

that she's grounded.

Really?

319
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,354
You think it might be
a smart idea to apologize

00:16:50,526 --> 00:16:53,943

and then we could go from there?

00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,071
Pretty sure he and half his golf
buddies want this case closed

338
00:17:52,209 --> 00:17:54,314
before Sternblatt's law practice

339
00:17:54,452 --> 00:17:57,490
and all their divorce details
get dragged through the mud.

340
00:17:57,628 --> 00:17:59,319
-I see.
-Shouldn't affect you, though.

341
00:17:59,457 --> 00:18:02,598
I provide cover. You work
the case, long as it takes.

342
00:18:02,736 --> 00:18:04,152
That's a nice sentiment,

343
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,610
only I just got off the phone
with the Department of Media.

344
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,571
They were fact-checking a
press release about the arrest,

345
00:18:09,709 --> 00:18:11,469
the one I assume
you're holding right now.

346
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,871
Rushing this out when
we don't have the facts yet

347
00:18:13,954 --> 00:18:16,750
doesn't seem to me like
letting the wheels of justice turn.

348
00:18:17,924 --> 00:18:20,754
This arrest, sloppy police work?

349
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:23,067
No, she's our haunter.

350
00:18:23,585 --> 00:18:25,069
Then you have
nothing to worry about.

351
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:31,696
-[sighs]
-[door closes]

352
00:18:32,973 --> 00:18:34,734
[Nick] Shawna Khurmi.

353
00:18:35,735 --> 00:18:36,736
That's K-H-U...

354
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,637
Is the furniture small?

355
00:18:41,775 --> 00:18:43,260
No, you're big.

356
00:18:45,641 --> 00:18:49,128
Guess the world wasn't built
for people my size, huh?

357
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:53,960
Anyway, it's Khurmi.
K-H-U-R-M-I. Twenty-seven.

358
00:18:54,098 --> 00:18:57,481
Special effects wiz.
Electrical engineering. Oh.

359
00:18:58,275 --> 00:18:59,862
Cal Arts grad. Wow.

360
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,383
-I've asked for a lawyer.
-Yes, I heard, as is your right.

361
00:19:03,521 --> 00:19:07,007
It's just that this release is
gonna go out before they get here,

362
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,065
so I thought I'd give you
a chance to correct the error.

363
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,942
So it is true.
New cap's doing the interview.

364
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,116
Mm-hmm.

365
00:19:12,289 --> 00:19:13,738
Mind if I watch?

366
00:19:15,292 --> 00:19:17,017
Knock yourself out.

367
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:21,677
You know, I won't lie. Lawyers hate
these releases. Court of public opinion.

368
00:19:21,815 --> 00:19:25,854
Once we tell the world you're a killer,
good luck convincing a jury otherwise.

369
00:19:25,992 --> 00:19:28,063
But we're just gonna go
with what we know.

370
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:30,341
You applied your skills
to stage a high-tech haunt

371
00:19:30,479 --> 00:19:31,599
spanning a matter of months.

372
00:19:31,722 --> 00:19:33,241
You used your fancy toys

373
00:19:33,379 --> 00:19:37,831
and an inspired cameo as
the ghost of Maddie St. Croix

374
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:39,523
that led to the death of Danny.

375
00:19:40,144 --> 00:19:43,043
You killed him. And then you
saw those kids at the window.

376
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,822
You knew the cops
were coming then, right?

377
00:19:44,907 --> 00:19:46,530
At least that's the story now.

378
00:19:48,428 --> 00:19:50,948
But you know, I know you have
a lot of student debt,

379
00:19:51,086 --> 00:19:55,159
and I also can't tie you to Sternblatt,
which means someone paid you.

380
00:19:55,711 --> 00:19:57,023
Shawna, give me their name,

381
00:19:57,851 --> 00:19:59,957
and this press release
disappears.

382
00:20:00,682 --> 00:20:02,131
You don't get labeled a killer

383
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:04,755
and this whole thing
comes grinding to a halt.

384
00:20:04,893 --> 00:20:06,205
[Oz chuckles]

385
00:20:07,861 --> 00:20:09,035
Help me help you.

386
00:20:11,555 --> 00:20:13,129
I tried to save him,
but I don't know CPR,

387
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,751
and she never told me
about his heart condition.

388
00:20:14,834 --> 00:20:16,180
She who?

389
00:20:16,353 --> 00:20:17,871
Danny's wife, Lorraine.

390
00:20:22,393 --> 00:20:23,843
Wow, that's, uh...

391
00:20:24,533 --> 00:20:27,260
[clears throat] ...that's good.
It's good work.

392
00:20:27,398 --> 00:20:28,882
Sure, but he still
could've told us.

393
00:20:30,056 --> 00:20:32,148
-Lorraine back in town yet?
-She should've just landed.

394
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,460
She did say something about
having to stop by her office first

395
00:20:34,543 --> 00:20:35,648
before coming to see us.

396
00:20:35,786 --> 00:20:37,498
Then have Karadec and Morgan
meet her there.

397
00:20:37,581 --> 00:20:39,099
I think she'll squeeze us in.

398
00:20:43,621 --> 00:20:45,713
[person] I'm just trying to
make sure you're taken care of.

399
00:20:45,796 --> 00:20:49,662
No, you're not. You're trying to
make sure you're taken care of.

400
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,216
You always loved that house
more than you loved my dad.

401
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:58,257
Excuse me. LAPD.

402
00:20:59,568 --> 00:21:01,915
Did you just say
Danny Sternblatt was your dad?

403
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:04,124
Yeah, I'm Paloma Nichols.

404
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,574
I'm really sorry for your loss.

405
00:21:05,747 --> 00:21:07,562
It doesn't sound like Lorraine
in there is your mom?

406
00:21:07,645 --> 00:21:10,752
[scoffs] Dad's second wife.
He and my mom split ages ago.

407
00:21:11,787 --> 00:21:14,273
Wait, do you think Lorraine had
something to do with his death?

408
00:21:14,411 --> 00:21:15,929
It's too soon to comment.

409
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:18,449
[sighs] I wouldn't
put it past her.

410
00:21:18,587 --> 00:21:21,728
She invited me here
to supposedly make peace.

411
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,041
Really, she wanted
to feel out my intentions.

412
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:25,939
My dad's body
isn't even cold yet.

413
00:21:26,802 --> 00:21:29,598
Uh, sorry, Ms. Nichols, we may
have some questions for you too.

414
00:21:29,771 --> 00:21:32,429
-Is there any way we can reach you?
-Yeah.

415
00:21:32,567 --> 00:21:35,294
It's Dr. Nichols.
Here's all my info.

416
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:38,469
When you are ready to comment,
I'd love to hear it.

417
00:21:38,607 --> 00:21:41,507
[Lorraine] Jody, I'm wiped.
I'm gonna head home.

418
00:21:41,645 --> 00:21:43,681
Hey, if the, uh,
police call again,

419
00:21:43,819 --> 00:21:46,097
let them know
I'll go there in the morning.

420
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:48,272
Saved you the trip.

421
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,656
Ms. Khurmi
identified you by name.

422
00:21:52,794 --> 00:21:54,692
Says you met when you spoke
at a class she took,

423
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:57,695
and a few months later, you
approached her for help with a haunting

424
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:00,042
and offered her a job
at your firm in exchange.

425
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:03,287
Shawna says she had no idea about
Danny's heart, and we believe her.

426
00:22:03,425 --> 00:22:05,358
The problem is you did know,

427
00:22:05,496 --> 00:22:08,176
because he'd had a previous heart
attack when you guys were married.

428
00:22:09,293 --> 00:22:10,467
I knew.

429
00:22:11,813 --> 00:22:13,366
His recovery was the last time

430
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,817
I can remember us being good
to each other.

431
00:22:16,818 --> 00:22:19,199
So it sounds like you did
love each other at one point.

432
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,925
Yeah, I mean, I...

433
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,103
He used to write me
these letters all the time.

434
00:22:27,898 --> 00:22:32,661
We were one of history's great
couples, like Dash and Maddie.

435
00:22:33,317 --> 00:22:36,562
Until Danny started acting a little too
much like Dash and cheated on you.

436
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,011
I was devastated.

437
00:22:39,703 --> 00:22:44,777
And then when I decided that I had
enough, he used every trick against me.

438
00:22:44,915 --> 00:22:48,677
He changed locks while I was
traveling, swore I'd never get the house.

439
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:51,266
It was all about winning.

440
00:22:51,404 --> 00:22:54,462
So you decided to play dirty too and used
his superstitions to get what you wanted.

441
00:22:54,545 --> 00:22:56,892
[sighs] Listen,
I know that it went too far,

442
00:22:57,721 --> 00:23:00,206
but I never wanted to kill him.

443
00:23:00,344 --> 00:23:01,725
I just wanted the house.

444
00:23:02,415 --> 00:23:05,729
I mean, I figured if I spooked him
enough, he would just sign it over.

445
00:23:07,524 --> 00:23:11,700
Wait, you met his daughter
on her way out.

446
00:23:11,873 --> 00:23:15,359
The house was in Danny's name.
He... He left it to her.

447
00:23:15,532 --> 00:23:16,878
She would inherit the house.

448
00:23:17,016 --> 00:23:20,053
You needed him to give it over
to you while he was alive.

449
00:23:21,227 --> 00:23:22,435
Yeah, well...

450
00:23:23,229 --> 00:23:27,233
Doesn't change the fact that he's
dead and I have to live with that.

451
00:23:30,443 --> 00:23:32,963
Wait,
is this Danny's handwriting?

452
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,950
Oh, this doesn't look anything
like the letters at the house.

453
00:23:37,554 --> 00:23:41,385
That writing was really messy,
shaky, like his hands were weak.

454
00:23:41,558 --> 00:23:44,077
Also, I think
he was off-balance.

455
00:23:44,802 --> 00:23:47,184
<i>Poor guy was stumbling all
over the place like the undead.</i>

456
00:23:47,874 --> 00:23:50,083
Karadec, I think we've gotta
check those sleeping pills.

457
00:23:50,256 --> 00:23:51,936
I'll have the ME
fast-track his tox report.

458
00:23:52,085 --> 00:23:53,742
[stutters]
Wait, what's going on?

459
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,608
You could have scared Danny
to death, but I don't think you did.

460
00:24:00,266 --> 00:24:01,543
I think he was poisoned.

461
00:24:04,615 --> 00:24:06,203
Lab reports are back.

462
00:24:07,066 --> 00:24:08,447
Those weren't sleeping pills.

463
00:24:08,619 --> 00:24:12,002
Danny Sternblatt died from
a potassium chloride overdose

464
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,969
which induced
a fatal heart attack.

465
00:24:14,107 --> 00:24:15,833
ME said it was a smart way
to kill someone.

466
00:24:15,971 --> 00:24:18,940
Potassium chloride spikes
naturally in the blood after death.

467
00:24:19,078 --> 00:24:20,341
Autopsy never would've
caught it.

468
00:24:20,424 --> 00:24:22,357
Which means if we
hadn't tested those pills,

469
00:24:22,495 --> 00:24:25,173
Lorraine Sternblatt would've gone
down for a murder she didn't commit.

470
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:26,879
Solid catch by Morgan.

471
00:24:27,017 --> 00:24:29,730
So, someone knew the wife was
gaslighting Danny and piggybacked on that,

472
00:24:29,813 --> 00:24:32,332
making it look
like she haunted him to death.

473
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,196
-Who?
-Had to be someone close to him,

474
00:24:34,334 --> 00:24:35,614
someone with access
to the pills.

475
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,185
You take a closer
look at the daughter?

476
00:24:37,268 --> 00:24:39,395
Paloma will get the house, but
the money motive feels weak.

477
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:42,087
I mean, she's an orthopedic surgeon
married to another orthopedic surgeon.

478
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:43,482
She's fine.

479
00:24:44,172 --> 00:24:47,244
What about Sternblatt's practice?
Didn't the wife say he was tough as nails?

480
00:24:47,382 --> 00:24:49,315
Yeah, said he used
every nasty trick in the book.

481
00:24:49,453 --> 00:24:50,733
Even came up with some new ones.

482
00:24:50,834 --> 00:24:53,319
Maybe a divorcé he did
a number on wanted revenge?

483
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,549
Or maybe a rival lawyer.
We'll head over to his firm.

484
00:24:55,632 --> 00:24:57,599
If the guy had enemies
over there, we'll find out.

485
00:24:59,394 --> 00:25:00,982
-He was murdered?
-Mmm.

486
00:25:01,154 --> 00:25:04,054
Oh, my God. I figured
his heart just gave out.

487
00:25:04,192 --> 00:25:08,023
Were you aware Mr. Sternblatt
thought that his house was, um, haunted?

488
00:25:08,783 --> 00:25:10,578
He made it impossible
not to know.

489
00:25:11,199 --> 00:25:15,099
Danny was freaking everyone out, that
woo-woo bracelet, jumping at shadows.

490
00:25:15,237 --> 00:25:17,550
We're wondering if anyone he
went up against with in court

491
00:25:17,688 --> 00:25:19,745
might've known that too and
used that knowledge against him.

492
00:25:19,828 --> 00:25:21,554
[scoffs] I wish.

493
00:25:22,382 --> 00:25:24,592
Well, I'm sorry.
[stammers] That came out wrong.

494
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:27,560
I just meant that Danny wasn't
in court anytime recently.

495
00:25:27,698 --> 00:25:31,184
He was too wrapped up in his own
divorce and winning that damn house.

496
00:25:31,357 --> 00:25:33,000
He handed off all his other
cases months ago,

497
00:25:33,083 --> 00:25:35,223
stopped coming in at all
the last few weeks.

498
00:25:37,052 --> 00:25:38,640
Look, I was worried
about my friend.

499
00:25:44,715 --> 00:25:45,715
Wouldn't you be?

500
00:25:46,717 --> 00:25:48,512
Have at it.
I have to call my wife.

501
00:25:52,689 --> 00:25:56,209
Huh. Well, sounds like Sternblatt
wasn't making any enemies here.

502
00:25:56,382 --> 00:25:58,522
-Took himself completely off the board.
-Mm-hmm.

503
00:25:59,281 --> 00:26:01,663
Feels like all roads keep leading
back to the Spencer house.

504
00:26:03,078 --> 00:26:05,359
What do you say we give
Daphne's ghost theory another run?

505
00:26:06,841 --> 00:26:08,463
I just do not get this guy.

506
00:26:08,601 --> 00:26:10,879
I mean, digging in
out of spite, that's one thing,

507
00:26:11,052 --> 00:26:13,054
but Sternblatt hated the house.

508
00:26:13,192 --> 00:26:15,263
He wasn't sleeping.
He knew he had a bad heart.

509
00:26:15,401 --> 00:26:17,976
At a certain point, you would think,
that the fear of having a heart attack

510
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:19,750
would override the desire
to win a divorce.

511
00:26:19,888 --> 00:26:21,441
[phone buzzing]

512
00:26:22,926 --> 00:26:24,790
You're missing out, Gillory.

513
00:26:24,928 --> 00:26:27,968
It looks like one of your crime boards
exploded all over our victim's office.

514
00:26:28,103 --> 00:26:31,175
Only in every direction it's
nothing but house, house, house.

515
00:26:31,313 --> 00:26:33,522
-Maybe it is something.
-[Oz] <i>What's that?</i>

516
00:26:33,661 --> 00:26:37,147
Well, I was doing a little digging around
in the Sternblatt divorce documents

517
00:26:37,285 --> 00:26:40,322
trying to find something that would
pop out as a motive to kill Danny.

518
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,703
<i>-And?</i>
-Nothing popped.

519
00:26:41,841 --> 00:26:43,657
But then I noticed something
weird about the house.

520
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:47,640
The appraisal when they bought it
showed it as 300 square feet smaller

521
00:26:47,778 --> 00:26:50,643
than it was when it was
appraised in the 1940s.

522
00:26:50,781 --> 00:26:52,217
<i>I mean,
maybe that's a mistake, but...</i>

523
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,510
No. No, it's here
on the blueprints too.

524
00:26:55,648 --> 00:27:02,068
300-square-foot difference
between the old and the new.

525
00:27:02,206 --> 00:27:06,486
How could they lose 300 square feet,
but the footprints look exactly the same?

526
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,696
-It's like there's a...
-Disappearing room?

527
00:27:08,834 --> 00:27:10,629
<i>I don't think
we're done there yet, boys.</i>

528
00:27:10,767 --> 00:27:13,459
I think the Spencer house has
more secrets to tell.

529
00:27:13,597 --> 00:27:16,496
And I'm sensing you have
a way of figuring that out?

530
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,373
He didn't need
to straighten that.

531
00:27:31,511 --> 00:27:34,376
Mind if I ask why you pulled
half my bullpen down here?

532
00:27:34,514 --> 00:27:36,896
Do you mind if I answer
in the form of a story?

533
00:27:37,034 --> 00:27:38,988
Don't answer that. It's
happening. It's starting right now.

534
00:27:39,071 --> 00:27:43,385
Deep in the gloomy glens of ancient
Scotland stands Castle Glamis.

535
00:27:43,523 --> 00:27:47,010
Legend has it that the heir
of the 11th Earl of Strathmore

536
00:27:47,182 --> 00:27:50,876
was hidden away in a secret room that
was walled up, never to be seen again.

537
00:27:51,014 --> 00:27:55,052
<i>But then, a few hundred years later,
there was a new lady of the castle,</i>

538
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:58,055
and she set out to find
the infamous hidden chamber.

539
00:27:58,193 --> 00:28:01,818
<i>This Lady Glamis knew that if a
room had actually been walled up</i>

540
00:28:01,956 --> 00:28:03,276
<i>that it would
still have a window.</i>

541
00:28:03,371 --> 00:28:04,924
<i>So she asked
her ladies-in-waiting</i>

542
00:28:05,062 --> 00:28:07,513
<i>to tie a handkerchief to
every window they could find.</i>

543
00:28:08,514 --> 00:28:10,343
<i>And lo and behold,</i>

544
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:14,002
<i>only one window remained that
was hanky-free from the outside.</i>

545
00:28:14,175 --> 00:28:17,040
And that was
how she found the secret room.

546
00:28:18,351 --> 00:28:19,939
And there it is.

547
00:28:22,908 --> 00:28:25,186
I'm guessing
this was Lorraine's craft room

548
00:28:25,358 --> 00:28:26,843
before Danny booted her out.

549
00:28:27,533 --> 00:28:30,329
Okay, that secret room's gotta
be behind these bookshelves.

550
00:28:31,295 --> 00:28:32,503
Oh!

551
00:28:32,987 --> 00:28:35,265
-You see it?
-Why don't you help us see it?

552
00:28:35,403 --> 00:28:37,577
This panel, it's plain sawn.

553
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,441
It has to do with
how they cut the lumber.

554
00:28:39,579 --> 00:28:41,947
These shelves are all quarter
sawn, so is the rest of the house,

555
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:44,412
but this panel is plain sawn.

556
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:47,035
Maybe Danny broke that panel
when he was tearing this place up

557
00:28:47,208 --> 00:28:50,142
and then repaired it,
but why only make the one fix?

558
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,315
[screaming]

559
00:29:10,058 --> 00:29:11,611
Mmm. Maybe to hide this?

560
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,895
This is Maddie's old boudoir.

561
00:29:19,412 --> 00:29:22,484
Oh, and that hat, that's the
hat that she wore to the premiere

562
00:29:22,622 --> 00:29:24,555
of the last film
she made with Dash.

563
00:29:24,693 --> 00:29:28,318
Can I try a couple of these things on
before they get shipped off to some museum?

564
00:29:28,456 --> 00:29:30,285
-They're evidence.
-I'll be careful.

565
00:29:30,423 --> 00:29:33,841
So we think this room's been
tucked away for 70-plus years?

566
00:29:33,979 --> 00:29:36,705
Well, Maddie took her own life.
Dash must have walled it up.

567
00:29:36,844 --> 00:29:39,039
Probably because his conscience
couldn't handle any reminders

568
00:29:39,122 --> 00:29:40,419
of the woman
he'd driven to suicide.

569
00:29:40,502 --> 00:29:42,297
[Daphne] Check out this gem.

570
00:29:42,435 --> 00:29:45,252
This room might've never been found if
Lorraine hadn't started haunting Danny.

571
00:29:45,335 --> 00:29:48,959
This room is part of history. Why would
Danny want to hide that from the world?

572
00:29:49,097 --> 00:29:51,962
Well, the same reason he didn't
leave when he started being haunted.

573
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,180
Gotta be something in here
worth sticking around for.

574
00:29:54,309 --> 00:29:55,379
Like this?

575
00:29:56,139 --> 00:29:59,107
-Oh, yeah, that would do it.
-Speaking of gems.

576
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,840
It's the only thing
not covered in dust.

577
00:30:00,937 --> 00:30:03,373
There is a rumor that when Maddie
caught Dash with his mistress,

578
00:30:03,456 --> 00:30:05,700
he tried to make it up to her
with a diamond necklace.

579
00:30:05,838 --> 00:30:07,550
-If those diamonds are real...
-They're real.

580
00:30:07,633 --> 00:30:09,048
They'd be worth enough
to kill for.

581
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,989
Hey, want some of this?

582
00:30:20,128 --> 00:30:21,820
I figure we deserve
a little unwind

583
00:30:21,958 --> 00:30:24,650
while we wait to see if that
necklace you found is real.

584
00:30:26,307 --> 00:30:29,828
Root beer on an unprotected
lip? You're a madman.

585
00:30:31,277 --> 00:30:33,314
-I'll take it slow.
-Did I shame you into that?

586
00:30:33,486 --> 00:30:35,005
No, no, it was time.

587
00:30:35,143 --> 00:30:36,823
All winning streaks
have to come to an end.

588
00:30:36,973 --> 00:30:38,353
Is that what we're calling it?

589
00:30:38,491 --> 00:30:39,803
It's okay. I'll take the can.

590
00:30:41,701 --> 00:30:43,842
Hey, you a Dash and Maddie fan?

591
00:30:44,532 --> 00:30:46,499
-Mmm.
-Yeah, I was.

592
00:30:46,672 --> 00:30:48,847
Little disappointed
in all the gory details.

593
00:30:49,019 --> 00:30:51,850
Yeah, this case isn't a ringing
endorsement for marriage.

594
00:30:52,367 --> 00:30:53,506
Ever been?

595
00:30:53,644 --> 00:30:55,336
Married? No.

596
00:30:56,199 --> 00:31:00,582
No. No, I mean, weddings are
great. There's... It's very sweet.

597
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,206
I get it. [stammers] I just...

598
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,004
It's good for people. I just... The whole
courthouse and the paperwork and the...

599
00:31:09,177 --> 00:31:12,974
the permanence of it, you know,
kind of kills the romance.

600
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:20,533
-Yeah?
-Oh, just seeing some things.

601
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:21,880
I don't think you are.

602
00:31:22,052 --> 00:31:23,591
-If this was an interrogation...
-It's not though.

603
00:31:23,674 --> 00:31:25,366
It's not an interrogation,
so knock it off.

604
00:31:25,504 --> 00:31:27,782
-Well, now I know I'm right.
-[laughs]

605
00:31:28,541 --> 00:31:32,269
Okay. Fine,
what things are you seeing?

606
00:31:32,407 --> 00:31:34,582
Well, first of all, you're
gripping that can so tight,

607
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,756
I'm worried you're going
to be wearing the soda.

608
00:31:37,585 --> 00:31:40,968
The neck massage, a little self
soothing, fiddling with the candy.

609
00:31:41,106 --> 00:31:44,143
Those eyes of yours are jumping
around to everywhere but mine.

610
00:31:44,281 --> 00:31:47,250
I think the talk of marriage is
making you a little anxious.

611
00:31:47,388 --> 00:31:48,596
-Okay.
-[chuckles]

612
00:31:48,734 --> 00:31:52,600
[titters] Yeah, yeah,
I don't like it, you know.

613
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:58,433
My brain has a way of making
sure relationships don't last very long,

614
00:31:58,571 --> 00:32:00,125
so let's just leave it at that.

615
00:32:00,263 --> 00:32:02,403
-Okay.
-What about you?

616
00:32:02,541 --> 00:32:04,060
Me? Oh.

617
00:32:04,577 --> 00:32:07,408
I'm into a four-year deal
that's working out pretty well.

618
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,099
-Really?
-Yeah.

619
00:32:09,237 --> 00:32:12,723
She understands me, and, for
the most part, I understand her.

620
00:32:14,587 --> 00:32:15,795
[Morgan chuckles]

621
00:32:16,624 --> 00:32:18,074
-She's gorgeous.
-Thanks.

622
00:32:18,246 --> 00:32:19,799
-She have a name?
-Ingrid.

623
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,561
Well, congratulations.
Ingrid seems like a real catch.

624
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:24,459
Thank you.

625
00:32:24,597 --> 00:32:26,447
What about an actual human woman?
Have you ever married one of those?

626
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:27,566
[chuckles]

627
00:32:28,463 --> 00:32:29,568
Got real close.

628
00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:32,709
She passed away a few years ago.

629
00:32:34,814 --> 00:32:35,850
I'm sorry.

630
00:32:36,437 --> 00:32:37,817
Yeah, me too.

631
00:32:38,784 --> 00:32:40,441
[phone buzzes]

632
00:32:42,443 --> 00:32:44,548
Hmm. Looks like they need us.

633
00:32:49,726 --> 00:32:53,972
[Karadec] 18-karat white gold waterfall,
102 cushion antique cut diamonds,

634
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:57,320
85 French cut for
a grand total of 317 carats.

635
00:32:57,837 --> 00:33:02,118
Designed in Paris by celebrated sisters
Ophelia and Josephine Beaumont in 1946.

636
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:04,016
-It's a strong accent.
-Hmm.

637
00:33:04,154 --> 00:33:05,466
So it's authentic.

638
00:33:05,638 --> 00:33:08,158
According to our contact,
based on the piece itself,

639
00:33:08,331 --> 00:33:10,989
-she said it was worth around ten million.
-[scoffs]

640
00:33:11,161 --> 00:33:13,715
That and a sexy providence
with a tragic Hollywood ending

641
00:33:13,853 --> 00:33:15,786
-and you, what, double the price?
-[gasps]

642
00:33:15,959 --> 00:33:17,167
Sounds about right.

643
00:33:17,305 --> 00:33:18,465
[Nick] So why was it
still there?

644
00:33:18,548 --> 00:33:20,239
Sternblatt must've
ball parked its worth.

645
00:33:20,377 --> 00:33:23,173
Why didn't he put it in Fort Knox
or try to find a tycoon to buy it?

646
00:33:23,311 --> 00:33:25,175
The guy was a divorce attorney.

647
00:33:25,348 --> 00:33:27,612
Nobody knew better than him that if
Lorraine found out, she could claim half.

648
00:33:27,695 --> 00:33:29,855
[Selena] So we're thinking he
opted to leave it behind the wall

649
00:33:29,938 --> 00:33:31,147
until the divorce was final.

650
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:32,907
Anything else
would've been too risky.

651
00:33:33,045 --> 00:33:35,645
Then he could sell it and make
up a story about where he found it.

652
00:33:35,737 --> 00:33:37,137
But somebody else
knew it was there,

653
00:33:37,256 --> 00:33:39,244
and their plan was to kill
Danny, steal the necklace.

654
00:33:39,327 --> 00:33:41,398
Until the kids saw Shawna
being Maddie's ghost

655
00:33:41,536 --> 00:33:45,678
and got us down there so fast, the killer
missed the window to complete the theft.

656
00:33:45,851 --> 00:33:48,115
The good news is this person
doesn't know we have the necklace,

657
00:33:48,198 --> 00:33:49,268
so that could be a good...

658
00:33:54,342 --> 00:33:55,951
[Morgan] <i>I don't think Danny
was sleeping very well.</i>

659
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,173
I just wanted the house.

660
00:33:57,897 --> 00:34:00,900
-No!
-The energy in that place is very off.

661
00:34:01,901 --> 00:34:03,903
You're trying to make sure
you're taken care of.

662
00:34:07,217 --> 00:34:09,012
You know who did it, don't you?

663
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:11,049
-Yeah.

00:34:40,526 --> 00:34:43,426
That's what I'm not so sure of.
The crossing over.

673
00:34:43,564 --> 00:34:46,256
I went there this morning. The
police released the house to me.

674
00:34:46,394 --> 00:34:50,260
Maybe it's all the stress
talking, but I felt him there.

675
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:51,986
Well, energy can linger.

676
00:34:52,124 --> 00:34:54,437
But then he could be in pain, trapped.

677
00:34:55,403 --> 00:34:58,406
Wait. Could you help him?

678
00:34:58,579 --> 00:35:02,479
Of course. I would recommend
a clearing ritual.

about the necklace all along.</i>

00:36:13,826 --> 00:36:16,001
I think Danny told you
that he was being haunted,

701
00:36:16,139 --> 00:36:18,417

right on that opportunity.

Poor Danny trusted you so much

he told you about it, right?

708

I mean, after all, he never made a
move in this house without consulting you,

709

<i>You switched out his sleeping
pills for potassium chloride,</i>

711
00:36:43,546 --> 00:36:45,637
and you convinced him to
check in with you every morning

712
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:49,034
to discuss all of the creepy things
that happened the evening before.

713
