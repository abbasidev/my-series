1
00:00:02,236 --> 00:00:05,239
You guys made mistakes,
I've fixed 'em. Let's not
make a big deal out of this.

2
00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:08,543
What mistakes did you see?

3
00:00:08,676 --> 00:00:11,078
<i>I have a compulsion</i>
<i>to put things right.</i>

4
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:12,747
<i>If I see a mistake,</i>
<i>I need to correct it.</i>

5
00:00:12,881 --> 00:00:13,848
Ta-da.

6
00:00:13,982 --> 00:00:15,550
I have an IQ of 160.

7
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:17,852
<i>The technical term</i>
<i>is high potential intellectual.</i>

8
00:00:17,986 --> 00:00:19,888
<i>Means you have</i>
<i>advanced cognitive abilities.</i>

9
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,189
Come do this full-time.
We need you.

10
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:23,625
-You know this woman?
-I'm his partner.

11
00:00:23,758 --> 00:00:24,993
<i>We're not partners.</i>

12
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:25,994
<i>She's actually</i>
<i>just a consultant.</i>

13
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:27,729
When you and I split up,
we agreed

14
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:29,463
we're gonna remain a family
no matter what.

15
00:00:29,597 --> 00:00:31,231
<i>Ludo thinks of you</i>
<i>as his daughter.</i>

16
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,066
-It's not the same.
-Your father loved you.

17
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,368
That's why he left.

18
00:00:34,502 --> 00:00:36,804
I need you to find someone.
Roman Sinquerra.

19
00:00:36,938 --> 00:00:39,007
<i>-He vanished 15 years ago.</i>
-You got a deal.

20
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:41,041
- You made this for your dad?
 -If you find him.

21
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:43,778
It turns out Roman was working
as an FBI informant.

22
00:00:43,912 --> 00:00:45,279
<i>"Two hours</i>
<i>to make your move."</i>

23
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:46,848
<i>Sounds like</i>
<i>some kind of game.</i>

24
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:48,716
<i>The kidnapper</i>
<i>wants us to play</i>
<i>by their rules.</i>

25
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:50,350
<i>They're watching us.</i>

26
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:51,886
<i>Oz isn't</i>
<i>answering his phone.</i>

27
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,955
I got him.

28
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:55,957
<i>This kidnapper is</i>
<i>really toying with me.</i>

29
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:57,424
He's making a run for it.

30
00:00:57,559 --> 00:00:58,826
-I'll take this for you.
-Thank you.

31
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,695
<i>Ava and I are too old</i>
<i>for this game.</i>

32
00:01:00,828 --> 00:01:02,362
<i>And Chloe's gonna need</i>
<i>a couple more years.</i>

33
00:01:02,496 --> 00:01:04,732
Morgan, I know where he is.
Roman. He's alive.

34
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,235
Hey, how's it going over there?

35
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:44,438
<i>Pretty good.
</i> <i>Just read him</i> <i>his third bedtime story.</i>

36
00:01:44,572 --> 00:01:47,474
What? Only three
bedtime stories?
You got off easy.

37
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:49,944
Thank you so much
for babysitting.
I really needed tonight.

38
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:52,080
<i>- Of course. Are you</i>
<i>on your way home?</i>

39
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:53,748
-Yeah. Yeah, I'm on my way.
-Okay. Be careful.

40
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:54,949
Will do.

41
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:56,784
-Love you guys. Bye.
<i>-Love you.</i>

42
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:50,538
<i>"Let's play.
"</i> <i>We have 34 minutes</i> <i>to make our move.</i>

43
00:02:50,672 --> 00:02:52,205
<i>"The fun has just begun."</i>

44
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,574
<i>They made me play games.</i>

45
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,475
<i>They were wearing</i>
<i>a white anime mask.</i>

46
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:56,978
<i>And they're watching us.</i>

47
00:02:57,111 --> 00:02:59,479
<i>Whoever is playing games</i>
<i>with us,</i>
<i>it isn't David Roy Peck.</i>

48
00:02:59,614 --> 00:03:01,649
<i>Well, then</i>
<i>who the hell is this guy?</i>

49
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,258
Mom, help! Help me!

50
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:12,627
What? What is it?

51
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,361
No one can help you.

52
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:17,532
What are you doing?
Are you serious?

53
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,102
He's... He's cheating.
My pillows, my rules.

54
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:22,202
Stop, okay?

55
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,504
First of all,
it's a pillow fight.

56
00:03:23,638 --> 00:03:24,906
There's no way to cheat.

57
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,339
Second of all,
they are not your pillows.

58
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:28,142
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

59
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:30,611
-She lulled me
into a sense of security.
-You have two, that's not fair!

60
00:03:30,745 --> 00:03:34,182
Hello! I am trying to read
my baby sister to sleep.

61
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:37,885
- Oh, okay, we'll do it
quietly. Shh.
- Ow!

62
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:40,521
You know, maybe if we
weren't stuck in this
house for like a week,

63
00:03:40,655 --> 00:03:43,191
- we wouldn't be acting
like animals.

64
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:45,560
- Wild animals. I can't.
- Snake attack!

65
00:03:56,838 --> 00:03:58,206
Your boss is here.

66
00:04:00,108 --> 00:04:01,408
Oh!

67
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:03,276
Perfect timing.
You're sleepy now, right?

68
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,377
Go to bed.
Okay.

69
00:04:04,512 --> 00:04:05,580
Do you mind?
I got him.

70
00:04:05,713 --> 00:04:07,280
Thank you.
I got him, I got him.

71
00:04:08,216 --> 00:04:11,586
So... how we holding up?

72
00:04:13,054 --> 00:04:16,724
Not great.
Pretty terrible, actually.

73
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:19,594
I don't know what's worse,
being stalked
by a deranged psychopath

74
00:04:19,727 --> 00:04:21,428
or having to lie
to my kids about it.

75
00:04:21,562 --> 00:04:25,265
There's no need to scare them.
We're gonna catch
this guy soon.

76
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:28,202
-Everything will be back
to normal.
-I hope so.

77
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:29,904
It's only a matter of time
before they realize

78
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:33,508
Ludo's not crashing
on the couch because
of a palm weevil infestation.

79
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:37,812
They're native to
his neighborhood. I figured
Elliot would check. He did.

80
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,649
Do you have anything else
for me besides this homework?

81
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:45,520
I wish I had more
of an update on Roman.

82
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:48,689
We're pretty confident
Gio's contact had good intel.

83
00:04:48,823 --> 00:04:51,926
He's staying somewhere
in Henderson, Nevada.

84
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:55,062
We got the force out there
helping us get closer.

85
00:04:55,196 --> 00:04:56,463
Do you have an address?

86
00:04:56,597 --> 00:04:58,633
Not yet, but we'll get one.

87
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:01,502
We'll figure it out.

88
00:05:03,805 --> 00:05:04,939
How's he doing?

89
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,275
Karadec?

90
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:09,977
He's ready to have you back.

91
00:05:11,078 --> 00:05:12,113
We all are.

92
00:05:37,972 --> 00:05:41,008
-Whoa, whoa! Daph,
where you going?
-I got plans.

93
00:05:41,142 --> 00:05:42,442
Really? At this hour?

94
00:05:43,644 --> 00:05:45,179
Settle yourselves.

95
00:05:45,313 --> 00:05:47,682
It's just a friend.
And you guys need to get
out of here too.

96
00:05:47,815 --> 00:05:49,684
We can't be pulling
back-to-back all-nighters.

97
00:05:49,817 --> 00:05:52,352
Yeah, you know what, Oz?
She's right. Go home.

98
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,822
Why? It's not like
I'm gonna sleep anyway.

99
00:05:54,956 --> 00:05:56,389
Not until we catch the bastard.

100
00:05:56,524 --> 00:05:58,358
Well, I appreciate
the sentiment,

101
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:00,728
but burning yourself out is
not gonna help the cause.

102
00:06:00,862 --> 00:06:01,896
Yeah, what about you?

103
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,463
I'll be right behind you.

104
00:06:03,598 --> 00:06:05,733
- You're a terrible liar.
 -Yeah, that wasn't great.

105
00:06:05,867 --> 00:06:08,069
-Later, guys.
-See you.

106
00:06:10,905 --> 00:06:12,340
Okay.

107
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:21,716
Hey, why you calling me
so late?

108
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,952
There's my grumpy guy.

109
00:06:25,086 --> 00:06:26,787
Nice to hear your voice too.

110
00:06:26,921 --> 00:06:28,990
<i>Why you working so late?</i>
<i>How do you know I'm working?</i>

111
00:06:29,123 --> 00:06:32,226
Well, you answered
your phone at 2:00 a.m. and
you don't have a social life.

112
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,394
Yeah, you know, this guy
went after one of our own.

113
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:36,330
He got close to you.
He got close to your kids.

114
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:38,099
So it's been impossible
for any of us to slow down.

115
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:40,001
I really thought
we would've found him by now,

116
00:06:40,134 --> 00:06:41,602
especially with his sketch
all over the news.

117
00:06:41,736 --> 00:06:44,171
Yeah. So did I.
You know, it's very detailed.

118
00:06:44,305 --> 00:06:47,275
Yes, it's very detailed.
I worked hard on that
with two different artists.

119
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:51,411
No, the nose is too aquiline.
The zygomatics
are just bananas.

120
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:55,182
What are you doing? Oh,
I thought I said a slight
cleft and just a little dimple,

121
00:06:55,316 --> 00:06:57,551
but apparently,
I said John Travolta,
and I don't remember it.

122
00:06:57,685 --> 00:06:58,753
Clear the whole thing.

123
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:01,289
God, I just
gotta learn how to draw.

124
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:05,326
I don't like
this feeling, Karadec.

125
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:06,560
It sucks. I hate it.

126
00:07:06,694 --> 00:07:08,596
Yeah. I do too.

127
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:11,966
Yeah.

128
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,902
Get yourself some sleep.

129
00:07:15,937 --> 00:07:16,971
You too.

130
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:39,694
-Morning, Chester.
-Hey. What you got there?

131
00:07:39,827 --> 00:07:42,563
Well, nothing says, "Thanks
for looking after my family,"

132
00:07:42,697 --> 00:07:45,465
- like an open box
of shortbread cookies.

133
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,135
I would've brought you what
I made Chloe for breakfast,
but it was disgusting.

134
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:51,372
Yeah, Lieutenant Soto
didn't mention this
assignment would have perks,

135
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:52,540
so thank you.

136
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:56,711
It's a quiet night?
Yeah, yeah, all good.

137
00:07:56,844 --> 00:07:58,679
Hey, you all dressed up,
where you going?

138
00:07:58,813 --> 00:08:00,348
Just gotta go run some errands.

139
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,450
-I'll see you later.
-All right.

140
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:16,163
Nobody came by?

141
00:08:16,297 --> 00:08:19,400
No, just the usual.
Babies, dogs, you know.

142
00:08:20,368 --> 00:08:21,535
Why?

143
00:08:22,603 --> 00:08:23,671
Wrong address.

144
00:08:27,308 --> 00:08:28,542
Everything all right, Morgan?

145
00:08:28,676 --> 00:08:31,645
Yeah, I'm just gonna
go around the corner for a sec.

146
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:33,014
You want me to call
for a police escort?

147
00:08:33,147 --> 00:08:34,348
That's okay.
No, I'll be quick.

148
00:08:36,117 --> 00:08:37,718
Keep an eye on the house.

149
00:09:24,265 --> 00:09:28,002
Why is no one picking up
their phones? I've been
texting like a maniac.

150
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:30,071
You guys, it's the Game Maker.

151
00:09:30,204 --> 00:09:33,574
He sent me this piece
of mail so that I would
walk by a very specific house.

152
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:35,076
I know it was him.

153
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:38,079
Do you have any idea
how rare it is
for the US Postal Service

154
00:09:38,212 --> 00:09:40,581
to deliver mail
to the wrong address?

155
00:09:42,016 --> 00:09:44,485
<i>Between optical</i>
<i>character recognition,</i>

156
00:09:44,652 --> 00:09:48,422
<i>barcode scans</i>
<i>and the ZIP+4 code system.</i>

157
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,926
It's super rare.
And he knows that I know that.

158
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:55,596
And he also knows that
the street
next to mine is a cul-de-sac.

159
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:59,600
So he knew I would have
to walk past, that house
to get to this address.

160
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:01,168
I know it was him.

161
00:10:01,302 --> 00:10:03,471
Good morning, Morgan.
Welcome back.

162
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:06,240
-I blasted in?
-Little bit.

163
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:07,475
It's too much.

164
00:10:07,942 --> 00:10:08,976
Sorry.

165
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,678
Good morning, Daphne.

166
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:12,947
Oz, it's really nice
to see you back at work.

167
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,482
You too.

168
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:16,417
-You doing okay?
-Yeah.

169
00:10:16,884 --> 00:10:17,985
Me neither.

170
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:20,321
And yes, Morgan,
we did get all of your texts.

171
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:22,123
And two voice notes.

172
00:10:22,256 --> 00:10:24,658
Which were kinda hard to
hear 'cause it sounded
like you were running?

173
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:28,162
Yeah, what?
Am I gonna tiptoe or mosey?

174
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,931
Of course I'm running.
It's important. Have that
dusted for prints, please.

175
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:33,000
What else is in this bag?

176
00:10:33,134 --> 00:10:35,102
Probably teething crackers
or something.

177
00:10:35,236 --> 00:10:36,904
I-I don't know. Don't make
a big deal out of it.

178
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:39,206
Also, that bag looks like
it can be used many more times.

179
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,708
Give it back to me
when they're done.

180
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:43,244
Okay, so do we really think
that this could be
the Game Maker?

181
00:10:43,377 --> 00:10:44,613
- Yes.
- Not sure.

182
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:46,313
- I am sure.
- Are you?

183
00:10:46,447 --> 00:10:48,983
Because last week,
there were other cases where
you were pretty confident--

184
00:10:49,116 --> 00:10:50,552
I understand, okay?

185
00:10:50,684 --> 00:10:52,521
I jumped the gun a couple
of times, but, you guys,
think about it.

186
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:56,724
The song "The Lion Sleeps
Tonight," paired with
the Jungle Animal Match game

187
00:10:56,857 --> 00:11:00,461
that he slipped into
my grocery bag
next to my children. It is him.

188
00:11:00,595 --> 00:11:03,330
-What do we have so far?
-We're still gathering
information,

189
00:11:03,464 --> 00:11:05,399
starting with the person
who lives at that address.

190
00:11:05,534 --> 00:11:09,336
Just one name on the lease.
Maya Price. We left word
for her this morning.

191
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,506
Hopefully, we'll hear
back soon and she's okay.

192
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,042
Maya Price is my sister.
We can't find her.

193
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:18,045
1522 Wells Avenue?

194
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:19,880
Where's Mommy?

195
00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:30,124
I was babysitting Max
last night.

196
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:34,695
And I went to Maya's place
this morning when she
didn't show to pick him up.

197
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:37,998
<i>Her front door was open.</i>
<i>I just knew something</i>
<i>was wrong.</i>

198
00:11:38,132 --> 00:11:41,603
But how did you guys find out
that she was missing?

199
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:43,871
Our consultant, Morgan,
happened to be walking by.

200
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:45,339
I live one street over.

201
00:11:46,207 --> 00:11:47,208
-Really?
-Yeah.

202
00:11:47,975 --> 00:11:49,678
It's a weird coincidence.

203
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:52,746
Sarah, take us through
everything from last night.

204
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,517
<i>Okay,</i>
<i>Maya got some free tickets</i>

205
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,117
<i>to see a show</i>
<i>at Sound Night Club.</i>

206
00:11:57,251 --> 00:11:58,520
Any idea who she was with?

207
00:11:58,653 --> 00:12:01,188
A friend from work, I...
I think.

208
00:12:01,322 --> 00:12:03,057
You know, she sent me a...
a photo.

209
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:07,928
-Where do they work?
-AGM, Artful Gal Music.

210
00:12:08,062 --> 00:12:10,699
She also works part time
at Costco to make ends meet.

211
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:14,101
Sarah, any chance
that Maya
may have had too much to drink,

212
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:17,238
ended up crashing
at someone else's place
last night?

213
00:12:17,371 --> 00:12:21,543
No, she's... Doesn't drink.
She's the most responsible
person I know.

214
00:12:25,346 --> 00:12:29,083
Sorry, I'm so scared that
something happened to her
and I'm...

215
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:32,086
- Play Flappy Bird, but...
- Let's see.

216
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:34,188
Yeah, I'm trying to hold it
together for Max.

217
00:12:34,321 --> 00:12:36,390
What's the situation
with Max's father?

218
00:12:36,524 --> 00:12:37,992
Derek, he's-he's...

219
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:42,263
He's a good guy.
He just has bad habits.

220
00:12:42,396 --> 00:12:44,798
He struggled to hold down
a job. It got kind of messy.

221
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:46,166
Messy? How?

222
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,702
Custody issues.

223
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:50,804
Yeah, they have
a court date set next week.

224
00:12:54,576 --> 00:12:56,645
Sarah,
do you recognize this man?

225
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:59,581
He's connected to another case
that we're working,
and we think--

226
00:12:59,714 --> 00:13:01,448
And, um, that's all
we have right now.

227
00:13:04,018 --> 00:13:05,620
No.

228
00:13:05,754 --> 00:13:08,422
I-I'd remember
if I'd seen him before.
I don't forget faces.

229
00:13:08,556 --> 00:13:11,792
Sarah, as soon as we have
some answers,
we'll be in touch.

230
00:13:14,596 --> 00:13:15,863
That's it.

231
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,305
Reminds me of my club days.

232
00:13:24,438 --> 00:13:26,940
Add that to the list of things
Maya and I have in common.

233
00:13:27,074 --> 00:13:28,442
Now, if the doorman
at the club said

234
00:13:28,576 --> 00:13:30,679
he saw Maya leave alone
around 9:30 p.m. last night,

235
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:33,113
then the question becomes
where did she go?

236
00:13:33,247 --> 00:13:35,583
This parking lot.
She hadn't been out in forever.

237
00:13:35,717 --> 00:13:37,652
She's not gonna drive around
looking for a meter.

238
00:13:37,786 --> 00:13:39,053
Plus proximity, you know.

239
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:40,854
Believe it or not, we don't
love using a pepper spray.

240
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:43,525
Fair enough. Well, Maya
drove a silver Honda Accord.

241
00:13:43,658 --> 00:13:46,193
If it's not here,
I'll have Daphne
put out a BOLO on the car.

242
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:50,598
I don't know, Morgan,
this is just way too exposed.

243
00:13:50,732 --> 00:13:52,132
It's unlikely
she was abducted here.

244
00:13:52,266 --> 00:13:54,803
-There had to be
a second location.
-Nope.

245
00:13:54,935 --> 00:13:56,705
This is the spot.

246
00:13:56,837 --> 00:14:01,108
Those busted street lights
provided the perfect
darkness for him to hide in.

247
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:02,577
And you see this?

248
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:07,682
This is a little heel
cap from her shoe.

249
00:14:07,816 --> 00:14:09,883
A shoe, not necessarily Maya's.

250
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:11,586
I'm just gonna keep going.

251
00:14:13,521 --> 00:14:14,823
This is where he attacked her.

252
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:24,365
<i>She fought back.</i>

253
00:14:24,498 --> 00:14:26,835
<i>She got away by using</i>
<i>her purse as a weapon.</i>

254
00:14:30,805 --> 00:14:32,774
<i>That lip balm, candy...</i>

255
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:35,844
and these little
glass fragments...

256
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:38,412
...that smell
like orange blossom

257
00:14:38,546 --> 00:14:40,981
must have been from
a perfume sample
from a department store.

258
00:14:41,549 --> 00:14:42,584
I'm familiar.

259
00:14:44,151 --> 00:14:46,220
Then she ran.
It was a Friday night.

260
00:14:46,353 --> 00:14:48,355
There had to be a guard
in that booth over there.

261
00:14:50,424 --> 00:14:51,726
<i>She needed help.</i>

262
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:57,464
<i>But she didn't get it.</i>

263
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:00,769
So then her heels
must've left these marks,

264
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:03,003
<i>presumably as he was</i>
<i>dragging her to his vehicle.</i>

265
00:15:04,338 --> 00:15:06,073
<i>Yeah, or hers.</i>

266
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:09,677
Which means she would've
been parked
in the spot right here.

267
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:12,045
Karadec, look.

268
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:14,549
There's two lines
of heel marks, and then
it just turns into one.

269
00:15:14,682 --> 00:15:17,451
So at a certain point,
only one heel
was dragging leaving a mark.

270
00:15:17,585 --> 00:15:19,554
That means she lost her shoe
during the struggle.

271
00:15:21,455 --> 00:15:22,489
Found it.

272
00:15:31,566 --> 00:15:34,769
He crammed her unconscious body
into the trunk of her own car.

273
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:39,273
<i>He was in control</i>
<i>the whole time.</i>

274
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:42,309
And she knew it.

275
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:48,449
I put the BOLO out
on Maya's car.

276
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:50,217
Good. Now alert the press.

277
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,186
Let them know we'll have
a briefing later today

278
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,087
and get a photo
of Maya ready to go.
Done and done.

279
00:15:54,221 --> 00:15:56,056
And maybe show 'em a picture
of this guy again.

280
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:58,992
Not until we know we can tie
the Game Maker
to her abduction.

281
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:01,529
Right now,
we focus on finding Maya.

282
00:16:01,663 --> 00:16:03,063
I'm very focused
on finding Maya,

283
00:16:03,197 --> 00:16:04,899
which is why I want
to focus on the man
who abducted her.

284
00:16:05,032 --> 00:16:07,468
I think she's right. There
are too many coincidences.

285
00:16:07,602 --> 00:16:09,771
-Prints are in
on Morgan's mail.
-And?

286
00:16:09,904 --> 00:16:11,305
Yours and the postman's.

287
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:14,542
Looks like Maya pulled a permit
for a weapon a few months back.

288
00:16:14,676 --> 00:16:16,611
- Protection from her husband?
 -Let's find out.

289
00:16:16,744 --> 00:16:20,815
I want Derek in here for
questioning stat, and we're
cleared to search Maya's place.

290
00:16:20,949 --> 00:16:22,684
Let's get over there.
Clock is tickin'.

291
00:16:38,298 --> 00:16:40,902
Hmm. You know, this record
doesn't fit the rest
of her collection.

292
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:42,837
We'll take it with us,
check it for prints.

293
00:16:46,508 --> 00:16:50,110
Locks are new,
probably installed
in the last month or so.

294
00:16:50,244 --> 00:16:52,647
Okay, so it certainly appears
like Maya purchased a gun.

295
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,314
There was a record of sale
from two weeks ago,

296
00:16:54,448 --> 00:16:55,717
but I can't find
a weapon anywhere.

297
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,484
All right, Daph.
We'll keep looking, all right?

298
00:16:57,619 --> 00:16:58,653
Okay.

299
00:17:17,271 --> 00:17:18,806
-Karadec?
-Yeah?

300
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:21,876
Look at this. Prada,
Gucci, Versace.

301
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:24,579
That's thousands of dollars
of stuff Maya can't afford.

302
00:17:24,712 --> 00:17:26,413
Gifts from someone.

303
00:17:26,548 --> 00:17:28,950
-Yeah, but they're all missing.
-Well, maybe they were stolen.

304
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:50,738
Karadec. Karadec!

305
00:17:50,872 --> 00:17:52,574
Yes, Morgan?

306
00:17:52,707 --> 00:17:54,241
I'm pretty sure those
expensive items weren't stolen.

307
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:55,577
They were sold. Let's go.

308
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,779
-Go where?
-The Boneyard.

309
00:17:57,912 --> 00:18:01,315
The Boneyard? Yes, of course.
Why wouldn't we be going
to the Boneyard?

310
00:18:01,448 --> 00:18:03,685
You guys check out Maya's work,
Artful Gal Music.

311
00:18:03,818 --> 00:18:04,852
Call me with anything.

312
00:18:11,358 --> 00:18:12,459
Fritzy.

313
00:18:13,595 --> 00:18:15,128
Good to see you.

314
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:18,098
Hey, it is too late to buy back
your mixer, Morgan.
It's long gone.

315
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:19,634
No, I don't want the mixer.

316
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:22,070
I also have a job now
that allows me
to keep my appliances.

317
00:18:22,202 --> 00:18:24,539
We're here on official
police business, Fritzy.

318
00:18:24,672 --> 00:18:27,675
-You're a cop?
-No, but they do sign
my paychecks.

319
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:30,511
This woman is missing.

320
00:18:30,645 --> 00:18:34,247
And I know she recently got rid
of some pretty pricey
designer stuff.

321
00:18:34,849 --> 00:18:35,883
So...

322
00:18:36,718 --> 00:18:37,919
So I'd like them, please.

323
00:18:38,052 --> 00:18:39,520
She could've sold
that stuff anywhere.

324
00:18:39,654 --> 00:18:42,456
Yeah, but she also picked up
an electronic piano
for her kid.

325
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,358
What? I have a monopoly
on electronic kiddy pianos?

326
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:46,193
Fritzy.

327
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:49,797
There was a sticky spot
on the side of it
in the shape of a dog bone.

328
00:18:49,931 --> 00:18:52,299
You sell people's stuff
and then you take off
the price tag,

329
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:53,635
but you never remove the goo.

330
00:18:53,768 --> 00:18:55,637
-Pain in the ass to get off.
-I know.

331
00:18:57,105 --> 00:19:00,108
Okay, fine. All right.
I did a good deal by that lady.

332
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,877
But I can't be handing over
thousands of dollars
of goods to you.

333
00:19:03,011 --> 00:19:05,312
It's hard enough to keep
the lights on
as it is these days.

334
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:08,082
-Uh, the LAPD will put it
on their tab.
-There is no tab, Morgan.

335
00:19:08,215 --> 00:19:11,351
The LAPD will reimburse you
from the city slush fund.

336
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:13,021
Not a thing.

337
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:14,989
Fritzy, why don't you
just turn over the items?

338
00:19:15,123 --> 00:19:17,558
Otherwise, I'm gonna have
to fast track a warrant
for a more invasive search,

339
00:19:17,692 --> 00:19:19,694
and who knows what kind
of illicit goods
we'll find in here.

340
00:19:19,827 --> 00:19:21,428
What are you doing?
It's too much.

341
00:19:21,562 --> 00:19:23,363
You trying to feel big?
He's trying to feel big.

342
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:26,266
This guy's trying to keep
his lights on.
Fritzy, I am so sorry.

343
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,102
I'll tell you what,
you let me borrow the stuff

344
00:19:28,235 --> 00:19:30,404
and I promise to give it
back to you
as soon as we're done with it.

345
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:33,074
-Fine.
-Yeah?

346
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:35,308
All right. Well,
thank you, sir.

347
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:38,012
And if what you're saying
about that lady is true,

348
00:19:38,146 --> 00:19:39,514
you might want to talk
to the fella

349
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,181
she was arguing with
out in my parking lot.

350
00:19:42,116 --> 00:19:43,651
Did you get a look at him?

351
00:19:43,785 --> 00:19:45,987
No, but my cameras did.

352
00:19:57,131 --> 00:19:58,866
Derek, the reason
why we brought you
in here today is

353
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,668
because Maya's been missing
since last night.

354
00:20:00,802 --> 00:20:02,737
She was abducted
from a car lot in Hollywood.

355
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,005
Oh, my God!

356
00:20:04,572 --> 00:20:05,740
Oh, my God!

357
00:20:06,741 --> 00:20:08,576
I had no idea.

358
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:13,681
-I... What about Max?
Is Max okay? Is he--
-Max is fine. He's with Sarah,

359
00:20:13,815 --> 00:20:16,718
and you would have known
sooner,
but we couldn't find you.

360
00:20:16,851 --> 00:20:19,286
Well, I was having
a few drinks
at a bar in NoHo.

361
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:22,422
Okay, I had more than
a few drinks. I was upset.

362
00:20:22,557 --> 00:20:24,158
I haven't seen my kid
much lately.

363
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:27,929
Looks like things g
ot pretty heated between you
two outside the Boneyard.

364
00:20:34,702 --> 00:20:37,205
Look, she...
She'd been dodging my calls.

365
00:20:37,337 --> 00:20:40,608
I-I admit it was a mistake
to follow her, yeah.

366
00:20:40,742 --> 00:20:43,745
She'd been getting
expensive gifts from someone.

367
00:20:43,878 --> 00:20:46,681
And I-I got jealous.
I admit that. Okay?

368
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:51,719
Look, I would never...
I would never hurt her.

369
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:56,289
Did you know that Maya
recently purchased
a firearm, Derek?

370
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:58,793
I mean, why...
might she do that?

371
00:20:58,926 --> 00:21:01,629
What? No, no.

372
00:21:02,163 --> 00:21:04,665
Maya hates guns.

373
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,567
He didn't do it.
We're wasting time.

374
00:21:06,701 --> 00:21:08,569
Maybe he did. Maybe he didn't.

375
00:21:08,703 --> 00:21:10,538
Maybe he knows something
we don't.

376
00:21:10,671 --> 00:21:12,305
Derek, what happened
to your hand?

377
00:21:14,075 --> 00:21:17,712
Honestly, I don't know.
I can't remember.

378
00:21:17,845 --> 00:21:20,915
I made it back
to my buddy's place,
and then I passed out.

379
00:21:21,048 --> 00:21:23,483
Maya is my whole world.

380
00:21:25,753 --> 00:21:27,121
Love of my life.

381
00:21:28,122 --> 00:21:29,590
And I miss my son.

382
00:21:29,724 --> 00:21:32,425
I-I-I've made mistakes,
yes, but I...

383
00:21:33,261 --> 00:21:34,327
I would never.

384
00:21:35,163 --> 00:21:36,964
You have to find her.

385
00:21:41,602 --> 00:21:43,470
Uh, we're digging
into Derek's alibi.

386
00:21:44,639 --> 00:21:46,741
-Okay.
-Oz and Daphne came back
with someone

387
00:21:46,874 --> 00:21:49,977
-I think you're gonna
wanna talk to.
-Barry Gibb?

388
00:21:50,111 --> 00:21:52,513
The woman that Maya
was with at the club.

389
00:22:00,054 --> 00:22:01,321
We had a blast.

390
00:22:01,454 --> 00:22:03,591
It was obvious she needed
a night to herself.

391
00:22:03,724 --> 00:22:05,358
The custody battle was
stressing her out,

392
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:08,029
and she was freaking out
over how expensive lawyers
can be.

393
00:22:08,162 --> 00:22:11,666
Your boss, uh,
Jason Howard, correct?
We'd like to talk to him,

394
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:12,934
but he's been hard to locate.

395
00:22:13,067 --> 00:22:14,969
That doesn't surprise me.

396
00:22:15,102 --> 00:22:17,672
He nepo'd his way
into the CEO position
years ago,

397
00:22:17,805 --> 00:22:19,941
and he has the work ethic
to prove it.

398
00:22:20,074 --> 00:22:22,710
He's more likely to be
on a scouting trip to Italy

399
00:22:22,844 --> 00:22:26,514
or at one of his vacation homes
than to be at the office.

400
00:22:26,647 --> 00:22:28,316
Hmm, gross.

401
00:22:28,448 --> 00:22:29,984
Uh, was Maya seeing anyone?

402
00:22:30,117 --> 00:22:32,687
Maybe somebody who could
afford designer stuff?

403
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,454
She told me about the gifts.

404
00:22:36,157 --> 00:22:39,260
I have my suspicions
on who sent them,
but she wouldn't confirm it.

405
00:22:39,392 --> 00:22:41,529
You think Jason was
sending her those gifts?

406
00:22:41,662 --> 00:22:45,066
I'm pretty sure the only reason
he comes to AGM at all
is to see her.

407
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:47,168
He gave us those tickets
to the club.

408
00:22:47,301 --> 00:22:50,171
Told Maya she deserved
to let go for a night.

409
00:22:50,304 --> 00:22:52,439
I mean, do you think maybe...

410
00:22:52,573 --> 00:22:55,543
No. Hell no. Maya would never.

411
00:22:55,676 --> 00:22:59,080
She felt weird about
taking the tickets
in the first place,

412
00:22:59,213 --> 00:23:03,718
but it was Gaga night
and peer pressure...

413
00:23:04,886 --> 00:23:06,754
Am I a bad friend?

414
00:23:07,855 --> 00:23:09,223
You're here, aren't you?

415
00:23:11,859 --> 00:23:13,861
You know, you kind of
look like her.

416
00:23:18,733 --> 00:23:20,201
Hey, Daphne.
What else we got on Jason?

417
00:23:20,334 --> 00:23:22,236
Half a dozen
sexual harassment complaints

418
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,403
over the last five years.

419
00:23:23,537 --> 00:23:25,573
Looks like they all
settled out of court.

420
00:23:25,706 --> 00:23:27,375
Sounds like he's paying people
to be quiet.

421
00:23:27,508 --> 00:23:29,543
No, not people. Women.

422
00:23:31,879 --> 00:23:34,414
-Morgan, where are you going?
-To get some air.

423
00:24:11,484 --> 00:24:13,187
Oz, call your favorite judge.

424
00:24:13,321 --> 00:24:16,090
We need a search warrant
for any and all residences
linked to Jason Howard.

425
00:24:16,223 --> 00:24:19,894
I know you guys aren't
a 100% sold
on my Game Maker theory yet,

426
00:24:20,027 --> 00:24:22,129
but hopefully,
this should clear things up.

427
00:24:22,263 --> 00:24:24,565
I'm guessing this is
what the inside
of your mind looks like.

428
00:24:24,699 --> 00:24:26,867
Oh, buddy. Not even close.
Okay, you ready?

429
00:24:27,001 --> 00:24:30,805
Jason Howard is a diabetic,
just like Spencer.

430
00:24:30,938 --> 00:24:32,640
As a matter of fact,
he is on the board

431
00:24:32,773 --> 00:24:34,976
of a research initiative
at County General,

432
00:24:35,109 --> 00:24:36,844
meaning he would know exactly

433
00:24:36,978 --> 00:24:38,646
how long a person could be
without insulin.

434
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:40,281
He's also a painter.

435
00:24:40,414 --> 00:24:42,183
These are his original works.

436
00:24:42,316 --> 00:24:45,052
Kind of reminds you of the ones
that we found hanging
in the gallery.

437
00:24:45,186 --> 00:24:48,622
Guys, turns out a trust fund
and a work aversion gives you

438
00:24:48,756 --> 00:24:50,191
a lot of free time for hobbies

439
00:24:50,324 --> 00:24:53,794
because he's also
a certified scuba instructor.

440
00:24:53,928 --> 00:24:58,466
I mean, half the guy's
Instagram pictures
are of him in exotic locations,

441
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:01,635
you know,
teaching impressionable
young women in wet suits

442
00:25:01,769 --> 00:25:04,305
all about the secrets
of the abyss.

443
00:25:04,438 --> 00:25:08,142
You ready for the big finish?
I have to admit
this is pretty fun.

444
00:25:08,943 --> 00:25:10,678
Mm-hmm.

445
00:25:10,811 --> 00:25:12,246
Mm-hmm!

446
00:25:18,552 --> 00:25:19,787
So?

447
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,822
Jason and the Game Maker
are one and the same.

448
00:25:21,956 --> 00:25:24,725
No! No, it's a trap.

449
00:25:24,859 --> 00:25:26,494
Guys, I just went
into the war room.

450
00:25:26,627 --> 00:25:29,697
It took me like five minutes
to get all this stuff
off the Internet.

451
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,365
He's trying to get us
to focus over here

452
00:25:31,499 --> 00:25:35,036
so we can keep slithering
around over there.
It's just too easy.

453
00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:39,006
This is what I think.
The Game Maker is
trying to frame Jason

454
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,976
to be a part of
whatever game this is
he's currently playing.

455
00:25:42,109 --> 00:25:46,113
Or, it's Jason.
It's always been Jason.

456
00:25:46,247 --> 00:25:49,950
And your guy is just
a Good Samaritan who helped
save the frozen turkey.

457
00:25:50,084 --> 00:25:53,220
Okay, then how did
that card game
get into my groceries?

458
00:25:53,354 --> 00:25:55,823
Whoever's doing this
has pulled off more
complicated tricks than that.

459
00:25:55,956 --> 00:25:58,059
Look, we're just saying,
isn't it possible?

460
00:25:58,192 --> 00:26:00,529
Sometimes, the easiest
answer is the right one.

461
00:26:00,661 --> 00:26:02,963
I don't care if it's possible.
This is what's happening.

462
00:26:03,097 --> 00:26:04,533
We still have
to follow protocol.

463
00:26:04,665 --> 00:26:06,200
I want to be
on your side here, Morgan.

464
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:09,270
But why would he go
to so much trouble
to frame this particular guy?

465
00:26:09,403 --> 00:26:12,039
Gosh, Oz, I'm not sure.
Let's find him and ask him.

466
00:26:12,173 --> 00:26:13,441
All right, enough.

467
00:26:13,574 --> 00:26:15,910
For now, we keep all
investigative paths wide open

468
00:26:16,043 --> 00:26:18,279
until the facts
tell us otherwise.

469
00:26:18,412 --> 00:26:20,948
Go be with your kids.
Keep your phone close.

470
00:26:27,688 --> 00:26:30,491
The stress is getting to her.
She's not a cop.

471
00:26:30,624 --> 00:26:33,562
-She certainly didn't
sign up for this.
-Selena, stop.

472
00:26:33,694 --> 00:26:35,663
Adam, she said no.

473
00:26:35,796 --> 00:26:37,064
Said no to what?

474
00:26:37,198 --> 00:26:40,468
The job. When I offered it
to her,
I pushed her into it.

475
00:26:40,601 --> 00:26:44,138
I promised to help her
with the Roman case
if she came on as a consultant.

476
00:26:44,271 --> 00:26:45,806
Why are you telling me
this now?

477
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,675
Because I put her
in this position!

478
00:26:47,808 --> 00:26:50,111
No, you gave her
an opportunity.

479
00:26:50,244 --> 00:26:53,881
You did the right thing
by bringing her on.
We need her.

480
00:26:55,783 --> 00:26:58,619
If she goes rogue
and something happens,

481
00:26:58,752 --> 00:27:00,589
maybe I just take her
off the case.

482
00:27:01,556 --> 00:27:02,591
You trust me?

483
00:27:03,791 --> 00:27:06,660
-You know I do.
-Okay. Well, I trust her.

484
00:27:10,731 --> 00:27:12,166
Would you like me
to take over?

485
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:14,268
Now that all the work is done,
that's when I really shine.

486
00:27:14,401 --> 00:27:16,070
It's okay. I'm good.

487
00:27:16,904 --> 00:27:18,272
Are you?

488
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,876
It's Roman.

489
00:27:22,009 --> 00:27:23,711
I think they're getting
pretty close to finding him.

490
00:27:23,844 --> 00:27:25,146
What happens if they find him?

491
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,582
What happens
if they don't find him?

492
00:27:27,715 --> 00:27:29,584
I just really want
this for Ava.

493
00:27:29,717 --> 00:27:31,185
I'll eat later if that's cool.

494
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:32,554
Wait, where are you going?

495
00:27:32,686 --> 00:27:34,655
-Keisha's having
a few people over.
-Oh.

496
00:27:34,788 --> 00:27:36,690
It's dinner time.
You know,
I'm still a growing boy.

497
00:27:36,824 --> 00:27:38,392
Okay, it'll be ready soon.

498
00:27:38,527 --> 00:27:40,361
It's not
a really great day for that

499
00:27:40,494 --> 00:27:42,329
'cause we're having
family night tonight.

500
00:27:42,463 --> 00:27:44,665
Again? We've been doing
this for like a week now.

501
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:47,134
Mom, I'm not stupid.
I know something's going on.

502
00:27:47,868 --> 00:27:49,236
I'll set the table.

503
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:50,639
Where are the cookies?

504
00:27:51,372 --> 00:27:54,241
Uh, the cookies?

505
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:58,712
It doesn't matter because
we eat our growing food before
we even think about cookies.

506
00:27:58,846 --> 00:28:01,815
The Ayurvedic system believes
that a small portion of dessert

507
00:28:01,949 --> 00:28:03,984
sets up
the digestive system for...

508
00:28:04,985 --> 00:28:07,188
-I'll wait.
-Yeah, you'll wait.

509
00:28:07,321 --> 00:28:08,856
Hey.

510
00:28:08,989 --> 00:28:10,824
Of course you're not stupid.

511
00:28:10,958 --> 00:28:12,627
And yes, we need to talk,

512
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,029
but can we do it when we have
a little bit more privacy,
please?

513
00:28:15,996 --> 00:28:17,632
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

514
00:28:24,805 --> 00:28:26,006
Hi, Morgan.
Hey.

515
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,208
Did you get my text?

516
00:28:27,341 --> 00:28:28,375
No?

517
00:28:31,445 --> 00:28:32,547
We're going to a party?

518
00:28:32,681 --> 00:28:34,348
You've got to be kidding me!

519
00:28:34,915 --> 00:28:36,917
Eh...

520
00:28:41,523 --> 00:28:42,990
The hell kind
of party is this?

521
00:28:43,123 --> 00:28:45,826
Jason's hosting
an album release
for one of his artists.

522
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,395
He said he couldn't get
out of it, but he's happy
to talk to us here.

523
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:49,964
Let's just take the weird win.

524
00:28:50,097 --> 00:28:53,133
Weird like these masks look
kind of like the Game Maker's?

525
00:28:53,267 --> 00:28:55,736
-Duly noted.
-Is there a mask
that speaks to you

526
00:28:55,869 --> 00:28:58,339
or would you like me
to match one to your aura?

527
00:28:58,472 --> 00:29:01,342
I tell you what, this one
right here is yapping at me,

528
00:29:01,475 --> 00:29:02,910
but I think you should
match his aura.

529
00:29:03,043 --> 00:29:04,546
No, that would not be
necessary.

530
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:06,313
If I'm being honest,
yeah. Go nuts.

531
00:29:07,248 --> 00:29:08,215
Uh-huh.

532
00:29:08,349 --> 00:29:10,084
Really get in there, yep.

533
00:29:11,051 --> 00:29:12,554
Yeah, bingo.
Nailed it.

534
00:29:13,187 --> 00:29:15,222
-Thank you.
-Bye.

535
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:20,294
Morgan, I need you to focus.
We still have to find Jason.

536
00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:22,263
I am focused,
and I already found him.

537
00:29:22,396 --> 00:29:25,299
He's right over there
in front of that wall
of 19-year-olds.

538
00:29:26,267 --> 00:29:28,603
Detectives,
thanks for showing up.

539
00:29:28,737 --> 00:29:30,705
Uh, can I get you anything?

540
00:29:30,838 --> 00:29:32,773
Yeah, a quieter place to talk.

541
00:29:32,906 --> 00:29:35,409
Maya's worked
for me almost a year.

542
00:29:35,543 --> 00:29:38,812
She schedules all my stuff,
my social and philanthropic...

543
00:29:38,946 --> 00:29:40,515
stuff!

544
00:29:40,649 --> 00:29:42,116
Is that why you bought her
so many gifts, Jason?

545
00:29:42,249 --> 00:29:44,118
Gifts?

546
00:29:44,251 --> 00:29:47,722
-Tickets to Sound nightclub.
-Oh, those are comps.

547
00:29:48,422 --> 00:29:50,224
I'm just generous.

548
00:29:50,357 --> 00:29:53,360
Yeah, a lot of stores
on Rodeo Drive
that would agree,

549
00:29:53,494 --> 00:29:55,530
not to mention
your platinum card.

550
00:29:55,664 --> 00:29:57,865
I-I was worried you'd
find out about that.

551
00:29:57,998 --> 00:29:59,534
Now why would you say that?

552
00:29:59,668 --> 00:30:01,101
Because I didn't buy
those things.

553
00:30:01,235 --> 00:30:02,637
Maya did.

554
00:30:02,771 --> 00:30:05,573
She has access
to my credit card
for work stuff,

555
00:30:05,707 --> 00:30:08,777
and my people noticed
a transaction
on my statement last week,

556
00:30:08,909 --> 00:30:10,144
and I confronted her.

557
00:30:10,277 --> 00:30:11,713
So you didn't fire her
even though

558
00:30:11,845 --> 00:30:13,380
she stole thousands
of dollars from you?

559
00:30:13,515 --> 00:30:18,653
Well, she denied it, and
I... have a soft spot
for single moms.

560
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,523
Besides, it's just money.

561
00:30:21,656 --> 00:30:23,991
Yeah. Totally. Just money.

562
00:30:25,025 --> 00:30:27,294
Ooh, those are beautiful.

563
00:30:27,428 --> 00:30:29,997
What are those, Tantõ daggers?
Yeah.

564
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:33,133
Yeah, I bought those
in Sakai City.
They belonged to a samurai.

565
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:36,136
Are you a collector?

566
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,971
Me? No. No.

567
00:30:38,105 --> 00:30:40,374
Those are a teeny bit
outside my price range,

568
00:30:40,508 --> 00:30:42,677
but, uh, I love how
you've displayed them.

569
00:30:42,811 --> 00:30:44,646
Yeah, they're arranged
by shogunate periods.

570
00:30:44,779 --> 00:30:47,314
They sure are. Let's see.

571
00:30:47,448 --> 00:30:50,819
Minamoto, Taira, Tõdõ,
Ashikaga, Oda, Tokugawa.

572
00:30:50,951 --> 00:30:54,556
Except one's missing.
The Takeda. It's not there.

573
00:30:57,891 --> 00:31:01,261
You don't strike me as a guy
who would display
an incomplete set.

574
00:31:01,395 --> 00:31:03,997
Jason, I'm gonna need you
to think real hard on this one.

575
00:31:04,131 --> 00:31:06,568
Where were you
last night around 9:30?

576
00:31:06,701 --> 00:31:09,403
I was here.
I had my chef make me a meal.

577
00:31:09,537 --> 00:31:11,706
I caught up on paperwork,
and then I went to bed early.

578
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,875
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to get back to my party.

579
00:31:15,008 --> 00:31:16,110
Taffy Boi needs me.

580
00:31:16,243 --> 00:31:18,412
I hope you find Maya.
I really do.

581
00:31:18,546 --> 00:31:20,481
You guys can see
yourselves out, right?

582
00:31:20,615 --> 00:31:22,316
Yeah.
Okay.

583
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:30,692
Well, he's lying. That man
doesn't work during the day,
let alone at night.

584
00:31:34,128 --> 00:31:38,065
You're waiting on me
to leave so you can poke around
Jason's den without a warrant?

585
00:31:38,198 --> 00:31:40,033
Yeah.

586
00:32:14,636 --> 00:32:16,638
Morgan. Morgan!

587
00:33:04,351 --> 00:33:05,787
Karadec!

588
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,822
Karadec! He's here!

589
00:33:21,603 --> 00:33:22,971
Hey, hey, hey, don't move.

590
00:33:23,605 --> 00:33:24,973
Mask off now.

591
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,523
<i>Jason Howard,</i>
<i>you're under arrest</i>

592
00:33:41,656 --> 00:33:43,625
for the kidnapping
of Maya Price.
I want all my lawyers.

593
00:33:43,758 --> 00:33:45,894
At least two.
They're on retainer.

594
00:33:46,026 --> 00:33:48,428
You have the right
to remain silent. Anything
you say can and will be used...

595
00:33:51,198 --> 00:33:52,901
Excuse me. Hey.

596
00:33:53,033 --> 00:33:54,836
I saw him. I know it.
Who?

597
00:33:54,969 --> 00:33:57,337
Him, not Jason. I know
I saw him. He was just here.

598
00:33:57,471 --> 00:33:59,807
-Well, where did he go?
-I don't know.

599
00:33:59,941 --> 00:34:02,442
-Well, Morgan, we still
have to find Maya.
-Yeah.

600
00:34:02,577 --> 00:34:03,878
Morgan.

601
00:34:10,284 --> 00:34:12,720
I want
your badge number
and your phone number.

602
00:34:13,688 --> 00:34:15,723
- Hey.
- Karadec.

603
00:34:17,257 --> 00:34:19,293
Come here. Where is she?

604
00:34:19,426 --> 00:34:20,628
Where's Maya?

605
00:34:20,762 --> 00:34:22,129
Did you kill her?

606
00:34:22,262 --> 00:34:23,565
Now, where is she?

607
00:34:28,101 --> 00:34:30,137
Hey, I got your messages.

608
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:32,674
The doors and windows
are locked,
and Chester's on alert.

609
00:34:32,807 --> 00:34:34,042
<i>How are you holding up?</i>

610
00:34:34,174 --> 00:34:36,209
Uh, I think it's gonna be
a long night.

611
00:34:36,343 --> 00:34:39,747
He was smiling at me.
He's enjoying this.

612
00:34:39,881 --> 00:34:41,348
<i>You guys are good?</i>

613
00:34:41,481 --> 00:34:43,618
Uh, yeah.
We're doing okay.

614
00:34:43,751 --> 00:34:47,055
I think it was the right
thing to do, telling
the kids what's happening.

615
00:34:47,187 --> 00:34:51,491
-Are they scared?
<i>-Yes, but mostly for you.</i>

616
00:34:51,626 --> 00:34:55,730
I told them their mom's
got the entire police
department looking out for her.

617
00:34:58,032 --> 00:34:59,734
You're a good dad. Thank you.

618
00:34:59,867 --> 00:35:02,670
<i>-I'll be home</i>
<i>as soon as I can.</i>
-Be safe.

619
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:21,188
Jason is not saying
another word.

620
00:35:21,321 --> 00:35:23,490
Which means we're no closer
to finding Maya.

621
00:35:23,625 --> 00:35:28,128
Maybe Jason isn't telling us
where Maya is 'cause Jason
doesn't know where Maya is.

622
00:35:29,329 --> 00:35:31,833
Well, he knew where she was
the night she was taken.

623
00:35:31,966 --> 00:35:35,003
The gifts were bought
on his card.
Her bracelet's in his pool.

624
00:35:35,135 --> 00:35:36,804
The missing dagger
from his wall.

625
00:35:36,938 --> 00:35:39,172
Yeah, I'm not saying
the evidence
doesn't point to Jason.

626
00:35:39,306 --> 00:35:42,910
I'm the one who said
it would. Remember?
We just gotta figure out why.

627
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:48,348
How dark was it at the party?

628
00:35:48,482 --> 00:35:50,652
One face,
all those people.

629
00:35:50,785 --> 00:35:53,153
What are you implying?
Are you implying
I didn't see him?

630
00:35:53,286 --> 00:35:54,756
No, we know you saw him.

631
00:35:54,889 --> 00:35:57,357
It would really help
if one of us could see
him too at some point.

632
00:35:57,491 --> 00:35:58,793
Yeah, it sure would help.

633
00:35:58,926 --> 00:36:00,895
I would love that,
but only I saw him
at the party.

634
00:36:01,029 --> 00:36:02,229
Just me.

635
00:36:02,362 --> 00:36:04,999
That's how he wanted it.
It was clearly by design.

636
00:36:05,133 --> 00:36:06,634
So,
what is the game, Morgan?

637
00:36:06,768 --> 00:36:08,136
I don't know what the game is.

638
00:36:08,268 --> 00:36:10,872
Maybe the game is figuring out
what the game is.

639
00:36:11,005 --> 00:36:12,840
And, yes, I hear
how crazy that sounds, but

640
00:36:12,974 --> 00:36:15,510
- what else can we expect
from this guy?

641
00:36:17,011 --> 00:36:18,478
Are you...

642
00:36:18,613 --> 00:36:21,381
Are you really suggesting
that I don't remember his face?

643
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:24,719
That man is a danger
to my children.

644
00:36:25,987 --> 00:36:27,155
Okay?

645
00:36:27,287 --> 00:36:30,058
I'm never gonna be able
to forget his face.

646
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,425
Long after we're done
with this,

647
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:33,260
long after we get him,
and we put him away,

648
00:36:33,393 --> 00:36:36,097
and you guys move on
to another case,
he's gonna live up here,

649
00:36:36,229 --> 00:36:39,299
cemented inside of my brain,
along with all
of the other things

650
00:36:39,433 --> 00:36:41,669
I gotta look out for
to make sure my kids are okay.

651
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:45,640
So if we could just, you know,
close the book

652
00:36:45,773 --> 00:36:48,241
on this whole Morgan-made-up-
an-imaginary-man thing,

653
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:49,711
that would be great.

654
00:36:49,844 --> 00:36:51,713
Okay, I've got something.

655
00:36:51,846 --> 00:36:54,716
A salvage yard in Sun Valley
just reported Maya's car.

656
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:57,051
Go check it out.

657
00:36:57,185 --> 00:37:00,454
And you call me as soon
as you land on the scene.

658
00:37:03,891 --> 00:37:05,126
Lieutenant Soto.

659
00:37:05,258 --> 00:37:08,261
Officer Sigman,
how are things in Nevada?

660
00:37:08,395 --> 00:37:11,733
That's right. That's right.
Roman Sinquerra.

661
00:37:11,866 --> 00:37:12,900
What do you got?

662
00:37:15,703 --> 00:37:19,272
The car showed up last night.
I saw your BOLO
when I ran the VIN.

663
00:37:19,406 --> 00:37:21,776
Did you see who brought it in?
No, sorry.

664
00:37:22,643 --> 00:37:23,678
This is it.

665
00:37:25,113 --> 00:37:26,147
It's all yours.

666
00:37:43,731 --> 00:37:48,903
-Hey. Are you okay?
-I-I don't know.
What do you think?

667
00:37:49,036 --> 00:37:50,538
If we pull Jason's prints
off the dagger

668
00:37:50,671 --> 00:37:52,372
and get him to talk,
maybe we can get to Maya.

669
00:37:52,507 --> 00:37:54,809
Just because she's wounded
doesn't mean
she isn't still alive.

670
00:37:56,544 --> 00:37:57,812
Morgan.

671
00:37:59,814 --> 00:38:00,848
You heard?

672
00:38:01,649 --> 00:38:03,283
I did.

673
00:38:03,416 --> 00:38:07,255
I also heard from our friends
in Nevada. They called
with an address.

674
00:38:08,122 --> 00:38:09,791
-Roman?
-I think so.

675
00:38:09,924 --> 00:38:12,960
I came after they called.
I figured you'd wanna
hop in a car.

676
00:38:13,094 --> 00:38:15,096
I can drive.
It's just a few hours away.
No.

677
00:38:15,229 --> 00:38:18,166
No, I'm not. I can't
leave my kids here
with that guy still out there.

678
00:38:18,298 --> 00:38:20,101
Daph and I can go,
if you want.
Yeah.

679
00:38:20,234 --> 00:38:23,237
-Whatever you need, Morgan.
-What... What is... going on?

680
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:26,674
After everything we went
through last week,
I filled them in too.

681
00:38:30,611 --> 00:38:32,479
Okay. Yeah, thank you.

682
00:38:32,613 --> 00:38:34,447
I'll call you as soon
as we have eyes on him.

683
00:38:37,652 --> 00:38:38,686
Who called him?

684
00:38:39,921 --> 00:38:40,855
Roman?

685
00:38:40,988 --> 00:38:43,691
No, Derek, Maya's ex, the dad.

686
00:38:43,825 --> 00:38:45,927
<i>He was at the police station</i>
<i>when we got there with Jason.</i>

687
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:49,163
Did somebody call him
and give him a heads-up
that we had made an arrest?

688
00:38:49,297 --> 00:38:51,331
No, Major Crimes
doesn't notify
victims' families

689
00:38:51,464 --> 00:38:52,667
about active investigations.

690
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,268
But he knew
we were gonna be there.

691
00:38:54,401 --> 00:38:57,738
<i>He was waiting for us</i>
<i>when we came in</i>
<i>with Jason. Do you remember?</i>

692
00:38:57,872 --> 00:39:02,143
If we didn't tell Derek
that Jason might've killed
Maya, who did?

693
00:39:03,211 --> 00:39:05,412
Hello.
<i>Derek, this is the LAPD.</i>

694
00:39:05,546 --> 00:39:09,416
It's about Maya.
I wish we had better news.

695
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:13,020
- It was him.
 -You think the Game Maker called Derek.

696
00:39:13,154 --> 00:39:16,023
He must've wanted Derek
to see Jason getting arrested.

697
00:39:16,157 --> 00:39:18,993
-Why?
-That's what we gotta find out.

698
00:39:19,126 --> 00:39:22,163
First, I thought he sent
this to me to get my attention,
to lead me to Maya's house,

699
00:39:22,296 --> 00:39:25,233
but what if I'm not
the only person
who got this flyer in the mail?

700
00:39:29,704 --> 00:39:32,506
<i>It'd be pretty</i>
<i>easy to steal Jason's</i>
<i>credit card if he had a key.</i>

701
00:39:37,879 --> 00:39:40,447
<i>He's the one who sent Maya</i>
<i>all those gifts and made it</i>
<i>look like Jason did it.</i>

702
00:39:40,581 --> 00:39:42,717
<i>He stole her bracelet</i>
<i>when he abducted her,</i>

703
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:44,585
<i>dropped it in the pool.</i>

704
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:47,387
<i>And then he grabbed</i>
<i>the weapon on the way out.</i>

705
00:39:50,024 --> 00:39:52,093
Okay, but why do all this?
Just to frame Jason?

706
00:39:52,226 --> 00:39:53,561
No, I think leading us

707
00:39:53,694 --> 00:39:55,863
in the wrong direction was
only part of the game.

708
00:39:55,997 --> 00:39:57,832
So what's the rest?
What's his next move?

709
00:39:57,965 --> 00:39:59,066
Well, look at all these gifts.

710
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,069
All the red ones are
either Versace or Gucci.

711
00:40:02,203 --> 00:40:03,738
What do those two men
have in common?

712
00:40:03,871 --> 00:40:04,805
They were murdered.

713
00:40:04,939 --> 00:40:06,874
They were both shot
and killed.

714
00:40:07,008 --> 00:40:08,542
Where's Derek?

715
00:40:08,676 --> 00:40:11,746
-You think Derek
is his next victim?
-Not exactly.

716
00:40:11,879 --> 00:40:13,814
Keep going. I'm listening.

717
00:40:15,383 --> 00:40:18,252
The weapon that Maya
supposedly registered for.

718
00:40:18,386 --> 00:40:21,055
-We never found it.
-I don't think
she bought a gun at all.

719
00:40:21,188 --> 00:40:23,224
I think he wanted Derek
to think that she did.

720
00:40:23,357 --> 00:40:25,458
Did you know that Maya
recently purchased a firearm?

721
00:40:25,593 --> 00:40:27,261
What?

722
00:40:27,395 --> 00:40:29,263
The Game Maker knew
Derek would want revenge,

723
00:40:29,397 --> 00:40:32,233
<i>and so he placed a gun</i>
<i>in Maya's house</i>
<i>after we searched it.</i>

724
00:40:32,366 --> 00:40:35,303
It's possible Maya was just
bait, and she could
still be alive.

725
00:40:35,435 --> 00:40:36,938
Yeah, it's possible.

726
00:40:37,071 --> 00:40:38,572
We're still waiting on DNA
and a blood type
from Maya's trunk.

727
00:40:38,706 --> 00:40:40,241
Yeah, I hope so.

728
00:40:40,374 --> 00:40:41,943
But if she's not part
of the game anymore,
he doesn't need her.

729
00:40:42,076 --> 00:40:43,945
Look, if we did everything
we were supposed to do.

730
00:40:44,078 --> 00:40:45,579
We played the game.
We played the game his way.

731
00:40:45,713 --> 00:40:48,049
None of the other victims
have died.
Maybe he's not a murderer.

732
00:40:48,182 --> 00:40:49,984
Not if he got someone else
to do it for him.

733
00:40:54,021 --> 00:40:55,323
<i>So it's Jason</i>
<i>he wants dead.</i>

734
00:40:55,488 --> 00:40:56,757
We gotta find Derek.

735
00:41:06,466 --> 00:41:07,969
<i>The Game Maker</i>
<i>created a murderer.</i>

736
00:41:08,102 --> 00:41:10,304
And we put the weapon
right in his hand.

737
00:41:26,587 --> 00:41:28,789
Derek! Stop!

738
00:41:49,176 --> 00:41:50,478
This is it.

739
00:41:53,481 --> 00:41:54,782
Roman Sinquerra?

740
00:42:01,322 --> 00:42:04,525
The lab should have
the blood test results
in 24 hours.

741
00:42:04,658 --> 00:42:06,027
Excuse me.

742
00:42:10,064 --> 00:42:11,832
Apparently,
you're looking for me.
