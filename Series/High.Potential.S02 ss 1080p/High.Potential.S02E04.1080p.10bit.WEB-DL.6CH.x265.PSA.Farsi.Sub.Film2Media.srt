1
00:00:06,273 --> 00:00:10,010
He shot her. I don't know
what to do. He just shot her.

2
00:00:15,917 --> 00:00:17,619
Oh!

3
00:00:17,752 --> 00:00:22,422
He's here.

4
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:41,174
I know, I get it. I'm late.

5
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:42,644
Honestly, I didn't notice.

6
00:00:42,777 --> 00:00:45,013
I got a ticket,
and I did stop this time.

7
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:46,848
Was it a complete stop?

8
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:49,249
Not necessarily.
That's poor time management.

9
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,553
By the sound of your voice,
this is somehow my fault?

10
00:00:51,686 --> 00:00:53,186
This
get-out-of-jail-free card--

11
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,388
Not
a get-out-of-jail-free card.

12
00:00:54,522 --> 00:00:56,223
That is
a police consultant ID badge.

13
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:59,459
It's useless. I should just
go back to flirting
to get out of tickets.

14
00:00:59,594 --> 00:01:01,029
It doesn't work,
but at least it's fun.

15
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:02,530
Or quit rolling
through stop signs.

16
00:01:02,664 --> 00:01:05,132
I don't need you to tell me
what I should and shouldn't do

17
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:07,602
-with stop signs--
-Morgan. Read the room.

18
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:16,678
You guys are so bad
at pretending to work.

19
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:18,913
I should put on a clinic.
What's going on?

20
00:01:19,047 --> 00:01:21,716
Soto's up for captain.
Slot's been open for a while.

21
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:23,250
Word is
she's got the inside track.

22
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:24,786
Okay, that's exciting.

23
00:01:25,954 --> 00:01:28,890
-Is that a good or a bad call?
-I was just about to ask you.

24
00:01:29,891 --> 00:01:31,258
That's not
what you all thought.

25
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:32,727
When I have news,
I will tell you.

26
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:33,928
You two, come.

27
00:01:34,562 --> 00:01:37,197
911 had a call
a few minutes ago.
You two should have the file.

28
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:38,600
Here's audio of the call.

29
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:41,069
<i>He shot her.</i>

30
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:45,105
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>
<i>He just shot her.</i>

31
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:47,976
<i>Oh!</i>

32
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,711
<i>He's here.</i>

33
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:52,847
Dispatch traced the call
to the address of Raina Viera.

34
00:01:52,981 --> 00:01:55,984
Okay, we could have two victims
and a shooter on the loose. Go.

35
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:14,301
Raina Viera,
you made a call to 911

36
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:15,837
about a shooting
and an intruder in your home.

37
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:20,108
No. I've already
told the other officers,
I made no such call!

38
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,275
Okay, well,
we listened to the call,

39
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:24,012
and it was traced
to this address.

40
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,313
-Anyone else live here?
-I live alone.

41
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,983
No one else was here. I don't
know what else to tell you.

42
00:02:29,117 --> 00:02:31,052
It wasn't me,
and that's the end!

43
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:34,488
Oh, except that it was.

44
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:36,624
Are you calling me a liar?

45
00:02:36,758 --> 00:02:38,559
No, she's just
calling you Gullah Geechee

46
00:02:38,693 --> 00:02:40,160
from the coastal community
in the southeast.

47
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,797
Yeah, beautiful accent,
but it's also very rare.

48
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,633
In my life, I've only known
one other person who had it.

49
00:02:45,767 --> 00:02:46,968
My old boss at the DMV.

50
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:48,069
Her name was Pearl.

51
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:50,938
Lord, Morgan.
I got to fire you, girl.

52
00:02:51,806 --> 00:02:53,841
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

53
00:02:53,975 --> 00:02:56,476
Oh, well,
the picture over there of you

54
00:02:56,611 --> 00:02:59,179
under the loblolly pines that
are native to South Carolina,

55
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,181
plus your accent,
which I've caught twice now...

56
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:03,250
- Oh!
- And that's it.

57
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:06,286
...kinda prove that you did
make that 911 phone call.

58
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,791
Well, unless having an accent
is a crime, you can go.

59
00:03:09,924 --> 00:03:12,560
We will be happy to go, ma'am,
as soon as we clear this up.

60
00:03:12,694 --> 00:03:15,362
Would you mind
if we just take a quick look
at your cell phone?

61
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:17,098
Why would I lie
about calling you?

62
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,801
We just want to make sure
you're safe. That's it.

63
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:22,335
Well, if it'll make you leave,
go ahead.

64
00:03:25,006 --> 00:03:26,206
No 911 call.

65
00:03:26,841 --> 00:03:28,676
-Weird.
-Yeah.

66
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,045
Well, just real quick, for me,

67
00:03:31,179 --> 00:03:33,514
otherwise it's gonna drive me
nuts the whole way home.

68
00:03:33,648 --> 00:03:34,982
You have
such a beautiful kitchen,

69
00:03:35,116 --> 00:03:38,351
so what's up
with these cheap pans
on your stove?

70
00:03:38,853 --> 00:03:40,253
You know,
I have pans like that.

71
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:41,455
That makes sense for me,

72
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:43,256
but it doesn't really fit
into this kitchen.

73
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:45,560
Is she for real?

74
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:48,196
We're good here.
We appreciate your cooperation.

75
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:49,664
Oh...

76
00:03:53,668 --> 00:03:56,571
She makes a call to 911
and then she denies it?

77
00:03:56,704 --> 00:03:58,106
What does that tell you?

78
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,307
That maybe she saw something,
but now she's afraid to talk.

79
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,577
Exactly. So if someone's
pressuring her to stay quiet,

80
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,845
how do we leave now?

81
00:04:03,978 --> 00:04:05,412
Because she told us
to get out of her house

82
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:07,115
and she hasn't
committed a crime.

83
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,616
Patrol canvassed the area.

84
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,350
No one saw or heard anything,
and my guy swept the place.

85
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:13,154
There's no sign of foul play
and no intruder hiding inside.

86
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,823
-Right now she's safe.
-Oh, what a relief!

87
00:04:16,591 --> 00:04:19,392
I'll put in a request
for unmarked surveillance
outside the house.

88
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:28,435
<i>Roman asked me</i>
<i>to put eyes on you and Ava.</i>

89
00:04:28,903 --> 00:04:31,572
I sincerely wish
you'd stop using my computer.

90
00:04:31,706 --> 00:04:33,641
Maybe you should get
a less guessable password.

91
00:04:33,775 --> 00:04:35,743
I take it you're still worried
about Raina Viera.

92
00:04:35,877 --> 00:04:38,980
Of course I am.
Soto getting surveillance
approved helps.

93
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:41,149
She fast-tracked it,
which actually took some juice.

94
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,316
Maybe it's a sign that
Soto got the captain's gig

95
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,685
-Really?
-Yeah.

96
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:47,054
Okay, so if she moves up
to captain, where do you go?

97
00:04:47,188 --> 00:04:48,990
Probably in there
as acting lieutenant.

98
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:50,625
Then who am I with?

99
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:52,260
Someone else.

100
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:54,461
I don't want to be
with someone else.
Unless it's Oz or Daphne.

101
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:56,597
-They're already partners.
-I can just work with them.

102
00:04:56,731 --> 00:04:58,431
There's no throuples
in law enforcement.

103
00:04:58,566 --> 00:05:00,868
That's just a failure
of imagination.

104
00:05:01,002 --> 00:05:05,139
Yeah. Look, I get it.
A mind like yours,
everything is organized chaos.

105
00:05:05,273 --> 00:05:07,875
So when things outside
your control change,
it's disruptive.

106
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:09,844
I don't like it.

107
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:14,515
If there is a transition,
it will be smooth.
We'll make it work.

108
00:05:15,283 --> 00:05:16,316
'Kay.

109
00:05:19,253 --> 00:05:20,453
Karadec.

110
00:05:34,936 --> 00:05:36,369
We did everything we could,
Morgan.

111
00:05:36,504 --> 00:05:38,940
Did we? It wasn't enough.

112
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:50,818
Daphne's finishing up
with the neighbors.

113
00:05:50,952 --> 00:05:53,221
So far, no one saw or heard
anything suspicious.

114
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,922
No signs of gunshot wounds
or other damage.

115
00:05:55,056 --> 00:05:56,791
Looks like
she just fell and hit her head.

116
00:05:56,924 --> 00:05:58,759
Well, Raina had
three missed calls
from somebody named Lucy.

117
00:05:58,893 --> 00:06:01,062
-Let's find out who that is.
-Yeah, will do.

118
00:06:01,696 --> 00:06:03,664
-Huh.
-I got my own "huh" down here.

119
00:06:03,798 --> 00:06:04,999
Oh, yeah? You first.

120
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:07,034
Raina's got a stain
on the back of her shirt.

121
00:06:07,168 --> 00:06:08,368
Doesn't look like dried blood.

122
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:10,104
Dirt maybe, right in the middle
of her back.

123
00:06:10,238 --> 00:06:11,505
I doubt she put it there.

124
00:06:11,973 --> 00:06:14,575
I zip myself
into enough dresses.
That's a tough spot to reach.

125
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:16,310
Yeah, my thinking exactly.
Your turn.

126
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:19,213
Well, when you're about to eat
it at the top of the stairs,

127
00:06:19,347 --> 00:06:20,848
you grab the banister, right?

128
00:06:20,982 --> 00:06:22,683
Look at all the rings
on her hands.

129
00:06:23,718 --> 00:06:25,086
There'd be scratches,
but there's not.

130
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:27,688
So either she jumped
or somebody pushed her.

131
00:06:31,092 --> 00:06:32,827
Raina witnessed a murder
and somebody killed her

132
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,928
before she could
finish reporting it.

133
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,730
So where's that crime scene?

134
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:38,065
According to the neighbors,
there was a wild party
across the street.

135
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,700
Let's start there.

136
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:44,605
This place
doesn't look so good.

137
00:06:44,739 --> 00:06:46,574
So, rough night?

138
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:49,476
Just a few people over
for a hang.

139
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,212
You mean a couple
of dozen people.

140
00:06:51,345 --> 00:06:53,446
Throw in some alcohol,
things get out of hand.

141
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:55,182
Maybe someone left worse
than they came.

142
00:06:55,316 --> 00:06:56,751
Or maybe they didn't leave
at all.

143
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:58,753
Whoa, I don't know
what you think
happened here, man, but--

144
00:06:58,886 --> 00:06:59,887
Any guns
in the house, Logan?

145
00:07:00,021 --> 00:07:01,222
Because we received
a 911 call

146
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:02,990
from your neighbor
about a shooting.

147
00:07:03,124 --> 00:07:04,892
And we're
starting to wonder
if maybe they got shot here.

148
00:07:05,026 --> 00:07:06,459
Maybe a drug deal gone bad?

149
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:08,229
Drug deal? Based on what?

150
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:11,431
How about not
judging the cover of a person
without reading the book?

151
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:13,433
Oh, boy. It was close.

152
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:17,605
No, not judging, just noticing
the unicorn sticker
on your mailbox

153
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:20,241
signaling to your customers
that you're open for business.

154
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:23,878
Customers like that
jittery guy out there just
circling around on his bike,

155
00:07:24,011 --> 00:07:26,781
waiting for us to leave
so he can come in
and you can sell him drugs.

156
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:30,718
Drugs that I'm guessing are in
that drawer that you looked at

157
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:32,320
when I mentioned your drugs.

158
00:07:35,256 --> 00:07:37,191
Oh, yeah, there they are.

159
00:07:38,693 --> 00:07:40,261
Logan! Hey!

160
00:07:40,394 --> 00:07:41,662
Right behind ya.

161
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:45,465
Yo, yo, yo. Give me the bike.
Sorry, man.

162
00:07:46,634 --> 00:07:47,668
Logan!

163
00:08:00,448 --> 00:08:03,050
So, Logan,
here's what we're thinking.
Someone died at your party.

164
00:08:03,184 --> 00:08:05,052
Raina had a front-row seat,
and you killed her.

165
00:08:05,186 --> 00:08:08,356
I didn't kill anybody.
And Raina, bro,
I was helping her.

166
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,590
Mmm, helping her how?

167
00:08:13,928 --> 00:08:15,062
You were her dealer.

168
00:08:15,196 --> 00:08:16,998
I don't identify
by that characterization.

169
00:08:17,131 --> 00:08:19,467
I'm a legit unlicensed
neighborhood pharmacist.

170
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,936
Hmm. Okay, so, uh, drug dealer.

171
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:25,473
No. I rob Peter to treat Paul

172
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:27,208
when the system denies
the meds people need.

173
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:28,609
Hmm.

174
00:08:28,743 --> 00:08:31,679
-And, uh, what did Raina need?
-Migraine meds.

175
00:08:31,812 --> 00:08:34,348
She fell on hard times,
lost her insurance,
couldn't afford the meds.

176
00:08:34,482 --> 00:08:37,585
So I hooked her up.
I really liked that lady.
I would never hurt her.

177
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:41,288
Logan, around 9:30
this morning, Raina made
a 911 call reporting a murder.

178
00:08:41,422 --> 00:08:43,224
-Where were you?
-With Raina.

179
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:46,293
She was showing me some
stuff in her basement, things
she could sell for bills.

180
00:08:46,427 --> 00:08:48,396
Then I get a call from Bones,
so I popped upstairs.

181
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:50,931
I hang up with him and
then Raina comes back upstairs.

182
00:08:51,065 --> 00:08:54,168
And she made no mention
of a 911 call
or witnessing a murder?

183
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:56,570
No, I swear.
She was completely calm.

184
00:08:56,704 --> 00:08:58,272
What time
did you talk to Bones?

185
00:08:58,406 --> 00:09:01,442
Probably around the same time
y'all got that 911 call,
9:30 or so.

186
00:09:02,511 --> 00:09:08,517
Okay, so Raina calls 911
while witnessing a murder
from her basement?

187
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:09,784
That seems weird.

188
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:11,919
Yeah, assuming Logan's
telling us the truth.

189
00:09:12,053 --> 00:09:14,688
But I think I have a way
to check his timeline.

190
00:09:17,158 --> 00:09:18,459
Black light, huh?

191
00:09:18,592 --> 00:09:20,661
What are you looking for?
Is this like a fluid situation?

192
00:09:20,795 --> 00:09:23,064
No, it's not.
There's no way Raina
witnessed a murder in here

193
00:09:23,197 --> 00:09:25,900
-unless it happened in here.
-Okay, so Logan might be lying.

194
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:27,735
If we can find his fingerprints
down here,

195
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:29,670
it means
he could be telling the truth.

196
00:09:29,804 --> 00:09:31,906
Instead of waiting a day or two
for Forensics to dust
and process prints...

197
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:34,675
- You are bending the rules.
Look at you.

198
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:37,278
Logan's behavior tells me
he's got a ton of drugs
in his system.

199
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:41,015
That changes
the way fingerprints look
under a black light.

200
00:09:41,148 --> 00:09:43,552
They shine
brighter than normal.
You see the difference?

201
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:45,086
Yeah.

202
00:09:45,219 --> 00:09:47,321
Yeah, I can almost guarantee
the glowing print is Logan's,

203
00:09:47,455 --> 00:09:50,024
which puts him here
in the basement, but in order
to clear him as a suspect,

204
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:51,792
we have to place him upstairs
at 9:30.

205
00:09:51,926 --> 00:09:53,294
My turn.

206
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:55,896
Do you remember the four beeps
in the 911 call?

207
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,865
Yeah, it was faint,
but I heard it.

208
00:09:57,998 --> 00:10:00,434
I don't know what to do.
He shot her.

209
00:10:00,569 --> 00:10:03,104
Okay, I think that was
Raina's bougie coffee maker.

210
00:10:03,237 --> 00:10:05,139
<i>Yeah, she was</i>
<i>drinking a cup</i>
<i>when we walked in.</i>

211
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:07,441
I think it was set to turn on
at 9:30 in the morning,

212
00:10:07,576 --> 00:10:08,843
but the thing is,
coffee makers like these

213
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:11,011
beep eight times
when the pot is ready.

214
00:10:11,145 --> 00:10:13,881
I've had some really bad bosses
with great taste in coffee.

215
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:15,749
-But we only heard four beeps.
-That's right.

216
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:18,587
Somebody turned the alarm off,
and I think that someone
was Logan.

217
00:10:20,421 --> 00:10:22,389
This proves Logan was here
at 9:30,

218
00:10:22,524 --> 00:10:25,159
so she definitely
made that 911 call
from down here.

219
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:26,861
But why? What could
she have seen
from the basement?

220
00:10:26,994 --> 00:10:28,162
Let's see.

221
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:32,466
Who are you? Oh, look.

222
00:10:34,235 --> 00:10:36,670
-2007's calling.
-Raina had a second phone.

223
00:10:36,804 --> 00:10:38,439
Yeah, but without cell service.

224
00:10:38,573 --> 00:10:40,941
That doesn't matter. Since '96,
the FCC requires
that all cell phones,

225
00:10:41,075 --> 00:10:43,410
active or not, have
the capability to call 911.

226
00:10:43,545 --> 00:10:44,912
Hmm!

227
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:46,280
-You knew that already,
didn't you?
-Yeah, I did.

228
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:47,681
I was hoping you did too,
'cause I thought

229
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:48,883
it'd be nice
to let you have this one.

230
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:50,184
Appreciate it.

231
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:51,952
Okay,
she turned it on from here,

232
00:10:52,086 --> 00:10:54,021
made the call from here,
but why? What did she see?

233
00:10:54,155 --> 00:10:56,824
Three boxes of brand-new
cheap pots and pans?

234
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:58,527
Buy one, get two free?

235
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:02,531
No, she needed them as backups
'cause she kept burning hers.

236
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:05,199
She was leaving the stove on,
and she was also putting items

237
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:06,934
from her kitchen
in the wrong spots.

238
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:09,870
The pills she was taking
weren't for migraines.
Those pills also treat

239
00:11:10,004 --> 00:11:11,640
early onset dementia.

240
00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:13,575
So Raina wasn't lying
when she said
she didn't make the 911 call.

241
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:15,776
-She just didn't remember.
-Dementia can rob you
of your memories

242
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,244
but can also jumble them all up

243
00:11:17,378 --> 00:11:20,047
so new memories can get lost
and old ones can resurface.

244
00:11:20,181 --> 00:11:22,149
But something
would've had to trigger it.

245
00:11:22,283 --> 00:11:23,851
You think while she was looking
for stuff to sell,

246
00:11:23,984 --> 00:11:25,452
maybe something set her off?

247
00:11:25,587 --> 00:11:28,222
Yeah, I think so.
And, honestly,
it really could be anything.

248
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:31,192
It could be a smell or a sound.

249
00:11:31,325 --> 00:11:32,627
Morgan.

250
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:34,161
Oh!

251
00:11:34,295 --> 00:11:35,729
Or a bloodstained dress.

252
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:38,065
-That looks
like a trigger to me.
-Yeah, that would do it.

253
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:40,000
So Raina did witness a murder.

254
00:11:40,134 --> 00:11:42,069
The question is:
when did she see it?

255
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:50,377
So Raina witnessed a murder.
We just don't know
when it happened.

256
00:11:50,512 --> 00:11:52,614
If we can date the dress,
we can date the cold case.

257
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:55,482
The earliest age
most people start
to form memories

258
00:11:55,617 --> 00:11:57,251
is around three or four.

259
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:00,655
Given Raina's age,
we can rule out
any cases prior to 1975.

260
00:12:00,788 --> 00:12:03,057
That's 50 years of cold cases.

261
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:06,126
15,320 cases, give or take.

262
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,962
Someone needs
to whittle that down.

263
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:09,863
Didn't you tell me
one time that vintage
is your love language, Morgan?

264
00:12:09,997 --> 00:12:13,467
I've never once said
"love language" to you,
but I can take a crack at it.

265
00:12:17,505 --> 00:12:20,040
Lot of staring. Everybody just
staring right at me.

266
00:12:20,174 --> 00:12:21,909
Yeah, a little space.
Thank you.

267
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:27,014
I need a lighter.

268
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:28,550
You just asked for space.
Now you need a lighter?

269
00:12:28,683 --> 00:12:30,818
Yeah, I'm a complex woman.
Can I have a lighter, please?

270
00:12:31,285 --> 00:12:33,588
This fabric
has a slight shine to it.

271
00:12:33,722 --> 00:12:35,889
It's not as glossy as satin,
but it's more polished
than cotton.

272
00:12:36,023 --> 00:12:37,224
I think it might be Tencel.

273
00:12:37,358 --> 00:12:38,959
-Anything else?
-Yeah, some scissors.

274
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:42,863
You do know this is evidence,
right, Morgan?

275
00:12:42,997 --> 00:12:44,965
Yeah. Yeah. You should
probably turn around.

276
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:53,675
Yep, burns quick and clean.

277
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:57,144
This is Tencel, which
was not available until 1985.

278
00:12:57,278 --> 00:12:58,979
Now the fabric
is just the first clue.

279
00:12:59,113 --> 00:13:01,181
Is the US registered
identification number
the second?

280
00:13:01,315 --> 00:13:07,788
It most certainly is, Daphne.
Okay, 178549.

281
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:11,959
This dress was manufactured
by Cibrian Creations,

282
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:13,762
but they went out of business
in 2015.

283
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:18,032
Okay, you guys know
when they started putting tags
in clothes?

284
00:13:18,165 --> 00:13:21,503
In 1971, manufacturers had
to provide clear instructions

285
00:13:21,636 --> 00:13:22,870
so that people
wouldn't screw up their clothes

286
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:24,271
when they were doing laundry.

287
00:13:24,405 --> 00:13:27,408
In 1998, the FTC approved
the use of symbols.

288
00:13:27,542 --> 00:13:30,177
The care tag in this dress,
it's all symbols.

289
00:13:30,311 --> 00:13:33,180
Now the final piece
of the puzzle
is the one that's missing.

290
00:13:33,314 --> 00:13:36,250
There's no barcode.
There's no inventory number.

291
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,653
This dress was made
before the year 2000.

292
00:13:41,422 --> 00:13:42,791
See, I like this staring.

293
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:46,460
That time frame leaves us
with 200 cases.

294
00:13:46,594 --> 00:13:49,396
Yeah, but Raina's 911 call,
she said the person was shot.

295
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:53,635
And then there were nine.
No, that's not it.

296
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:56,538
Okay, only one case
had a victim wearing a dress

297
00:13:56,671 --> 00:13:58,172
that looks a lot like Raina's.

298
00:13:58,305 --> 00:14:01,308
Greta St. John,
25-year-old black woman,
up-and-coming singer,

299
00:14:01,442 --> 00:14:04,679
last seen
New Year's Eve 2000 at a club
called the Black Jewel.

300
00:14:04,813 --> 00:14:06,480
She was found across town
in an alley.

301
00:14:06,614 --> 00:14:08,382
Died of a gunshot wound
to the chest,

302
00:14:08,516 --> 00:14:09,917
but no weapon found
at the scene,

303
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,754
<i>no witnesses,</i>
<i>not many suspect interviews.</i>

304
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:14,723
The ME didn't even list
a clear time of death.

305
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:17,559
The ME noted powder burns
and shrapnel on her right side

306
00:14:17,692 --> 00:14:19,159
but did very little about it.

307
00:14:19,293 --> 00:14:20,829
This case
didn't get any attention.

308
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:22,630
Young Black woman found
on the wrong side of town.

309
00:14:22,764 --> 00:14:25,366
Let me guess,
it wasn't a top story
on the evening news.

310
00:14:25,499 --> 00:14:28,703
Okay, so 25 years ago,
Raina witnessed
the murder of Greta St. John.

311
00:14:28,837 --> 00:14:30,971
And then was killed
before she could tell us
what she knew.

312
00:14:31,105 --> 00:14:33,842
It stands to reason
that Raina and Greta
were killed by the same person,

313
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:35,710
likely someone
who knew them both.

314
00:14:35,844 --> 00:14:38,045
According to the file,
there was a guy
named Eddie Friedman

315
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:40,180
who managed the Black Jewel
at the time of the murder.

316
00:14:40,314 --> 00:14:41,949
-Go look, see what he knows.
-Lucy,

317
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:44,118
the woman that called Raina
three times,
just got back to me.

318
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:46,588
-She's willing to talk to us.
-Divide and conquer.

319
00:14:46,721 --> 00:14:48,088
You guys track down Eddie.
We'll talk to Lucy.

320
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:49,256
Copy that.

321
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:54,061
What can you tell us
about Greta St. John?

322
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:56,865
Oh, she had a voice
like no other.

323
00:14:56,997 --> 00:15:01,034
The New Year's Eve show
was her moment.
She was about to go big.

324
00:15:01,168 --> 00:15:02,871
And did that rub anyone
the wrong way?

325
00:15:03,003 --> 00:15:04,271
Oh, yeah. Raina Viera.

326
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:07,374
<i>So, Lucy,</i>
<i>how did Raina</i>
<i>and Greta know each other?</i>

327
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:09,577
They were rivals
at the Black Jewel.

328
00:15:09,711 --> 00:15:11,078
Raina was a singer too,

329
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:13,715
but she didn't like talking
about Greta all too much.

330
00:15:13,848 --> 00:15:14,982
Any specific reason why?

331
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:16,851
I met Raina
when I photographed her

332
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:19,353
for a piece I did
in <i>Static Vinyl</i> magazine.

333
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:21,922
It was about lost voices
of the '90s,

334
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:25,593
talented women who just
never really broke into
the cutthroat LA music scene.

335
00:15:25,727 --> 00:15:28,663
I think it was hard for Raina
to talk about Greta.

336
00:15:28,797 --> 00:15:30,598
She defied the odds
when Raina hadn't.

337
00:15:30,732 --> 00:15:35,269
Greta's evolution as an artist
was...
...something else.

338
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:38,238
It made sense to all of us
why her star was rising.

339
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:43,678
During that
New Year's Eve show, everyone
knew who the star was.

340
00:15:47,682 --> 00:15:49,784
This doesn't really sound
like an artist on her way up.

341
00:15:49,918 --> 00:15:53,487
You're right.
See, that was Greta before.

342
00:15:53,621 --> 00:15:57,257
And this... is Greta after.

343
00:16:13,942 --> 00:16:17,277
Oh, wow. That hardly sounds
like the same woman.

344
00:16:19,046 --> 00:16:21,348
So this song was recorded

345
00:16:21,482 --> 00:16:23,150
after something happened.
What was it?

346
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:24,485
Mac Epps.

347
00:16:24,619 --> 00:16:26,320
His name came up
in my research.

348
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:28,523
He was Greta's manager
at first,

349
00:16:28,656 --> 00:16:30,290
but then he started working
with Raina,

350
00:16:30,424 --> 00:16:32,125
and now
he owns the Black Jewel.

351
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:35,128
So two rivals
and the same manager?
Sounds like a bad idea.

352
00:16:35,262 --> 00:16:36,865
Did Raina ever talk about Epps?

353
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:39,868
Not really,
but I did get the sense
that she blamed him

354
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,503
for her career
never taking off.

355
00:16:41,636 --> 00:16:44,839
He was shady. After Epps
got arrested on a drug charge,

356
00:16:44,973 --> 00:16:47,307
Greta found her voice, I mean,
literally and figuratively.

357
00:16:47,441 --> 00:16:50,310
But after Epps got out,
he wanted to be a part of it.

358
00:16:50,444 --> 00:16:51,478
Did Greta give in
to his demands?

359
00:16:51,613 --> 00:16:53,046
No, and he didn't take it well.

360
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,716
He started harassing her.

361
00:16:54,849 --> 00:16:56,183
The rumor was the only reason

362
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:59,086
he started managing Raina
was to get close to Greta.

363
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:01,188
He was using Raina as a pawn.

364
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:04,157
I think Raina realized
he wasn't really interested
in her career.

365
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,727
Then why didn't she leave?

366
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:08,830
He was a dangerous man
with powerful friends,
even then.

367
00:17:08,963 --> 00:17:11,498
And that's why Greta
wanted nothing to do with him.

368
00:17:11,633 --> 00:17:14,769
He turned her family's life
upside down for decades.

369
00:17:14,903 --> 00:17:16,638
It explains why everyone
was radio silent

370
00:17:16,771 --> 00:17:18,706
during
the original investigation
into Greta's murder.

371
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,543
I should have told the cops
what I knew back then,

372
00:17:21,676 --> 00:17:23,477
but I was scared.

373
00:17:23,611 --> 00:17:24,546
We all were.

374
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:26,581
If you have any photos
or videos

375
00:17:26,714 --> 00:17:28,883
from the Black Jewel
that we could borrow,
that'd be helpful.

376
00:17:29,017 --> 00:17:32,987
You bet. I have
more than you could ever
want or need.

377
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:35,723
We think Raina may have been
keeping a secret
that got her killed.

378
00:17:35,857 --> 00:17:37,391
Do you have any idea
what that could be?

379
00:17:37,525 --> 00:17:40,028
No, I have no idea
who would want to hurt her.

380
00:17:40,528 --> 00:17:42,362
I can't believe she's gone.

381
00:17:42,496 --> 00:17:45,098
She and I got really... close.

382
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:47,702
She was
like a second mother to me.

383
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,672
We're gonna find who did this.

384
00:18:15,863 --> 00:18:18,398
<i>The mailbox is full and cannot</i>
<i>accept any messages</i>
<i>at this time.</i>

385
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:21,869
How long
till the lab gets back to us
with the results on that stain?

386
00:18:22,003 --> 00:18:24,939
Oh, a lot longer
than we'd like. But you know
what's faster than the lab?

387
00:18:25,907 --> 00:18:26,975
-Me?
-Hmm.

388
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:29,577
Can I have
everyone's attention, please?

389
00:18:30,578 --> 00:18:33,748
You may have heard that I was
up for the captain's chair.

390
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:36,116
Turns out you're stuck with me.

391
00:18:38,686 --> 00:18:39,954
Don't be so disappointed.

392
00:18:40,955 --> 00:18:44,324
Right now, all I know
is they're bringing someone in
from another squad,

393
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,795
but no matter
who the captain is,
I expect you to treat him

394
00:18:47,929 --> 00:18:50,098
with the same respect
you treat me.

395
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,766
You're still my squad.

396
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:54,401
Continue to do me proud
just like you always do.

397
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:57,237
Let's get back to work.

398
00:18:57,371 --> 00:18:59,339
-It's not fair.
-Should have been you.

399
00:18:59,473 --> 00:19:01,308
Clearly they don't know who
keeps things on the rails
around here.

400
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:02,944
I appreciate all that.

401
00:19:03,077 --> 00:19:05,013
Why are you being
so cool right now? I hate this.

402
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:07,815
What are
this new guy's qualifications?
I'm assuming it's a guy.

403
00:19:07,949 --> 00:19:09,249
Statistically, yes.

404
00:19:09,383 --> 00:19:11,418
But you know what I hate?

405
00:19:11,552 --> 00:19:14,555
Unsolved cases.
We have two right now.

406
00:19:14,689 --> 00:19:17,491
So how about we focus
on who killed Greta and Raina.

407
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,027
So, suspects?

408
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:20,561
Well, Eddie Friedman
alibied out.

409
00:19:20,695 --> 00:19:23,163
He was at Corbyn Lanes
with his bowling league.

410
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:25,933
Lucy Hastings was at
a photo shoot at Griffith Park.

411
00:19:26,067 --> 00:19:28,435
She was alone, but her pictures
were time-stamped.

412
00:19:28,569 --> 00:19:30,505
That leaves Mac Epps
as our prime suspect.

413
00:19:30,638 --> 00:19:32,239
He's built an empire,

414
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:35,143
a mix of illicit
and legitimate businesses,
including the Black Jewel.

415
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:36,811
Yeah, and he had a motive
to kill Greta

416
00:19:36,944 --> 00:19:38,980
because she was
about to blow up
and wasn't taking him with her.

417
00:19:39,113 --> 00:19:41,549
What about Raina? Does he look
good for her murder too?

418
00:19:41,683 --> 00:19:44,585
Well, Raina moved
into her current home
shortly after Greta's death.

419
00:19:44,719 --> 00:19:47,387
No way she bought that house
in her 20s
unless she won the lottery.

420
00:19:47,522 --> 00:19:48,890
Which is why we looked
at the deed.

421
00:19:49,023 --> 00:19:51,391
The first few years,
Mac Epps's name was on it.

422
00:19:51,526 --> 00:19:54,529
It was either a gift
or more likely
a payment for her silence.

423
00:19:54,662 --> 00:19:56,664
A silence she maintained until
a dementia-induced episode

424
00:19:56,798 --> 00:19:57,999
led her to reveal the truth.

425
00:19:58,132 --> 00:20:00,668
Any indication Epps knew
that could be a possibility?

426
00:20:00,802 --> 00:20:04,906
Well, we dug up CCTV footage
from outside of the Black Jewel
a few days ago

427
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,709
-and we found this.
-That is Mac Epps.

428
00:20:07,842 --> 00:20:09,744
Yeah, doesn't look like
a friendly reunion.

429
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:12,080
No, it looks
like a motive for murder.

430
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:14,314
I think it's time
to visit the Black Jewel.

431
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:30,330
I know your silences, Morgan.

432
00:20:30,464 --> 00:20:33,568
-My silences? It's not a thing.
-Mm-hmm.

433
00:20:33,701 --> 00:20:35,203
Oh, it's a thing.

434
00:20:35,335 --> 00:20:36,971
You get quiet a lot.

435
00:20:37,105 --> 00:20:39,507
You got family-drama quiet,
a little furrow of the brow

436
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,943
and you start messing
with your cuticles like you're
trying to dig up a secret.

437
00:20:42,076 --> 00:20:44,244
There's case-frustration quiet,
clenching of the jaw

438
00:20:44,377 --> 00:20:47,615
and your eyes start scanning
like you're mentally breaking
apart the crime scene.

439
00:20:47,749 --> 00:20:50,818
There's the pissed-at-me quiet.
That's a classic.

440
00:20:50,952 --> 00:20:53,788
It's a stone-cold stare and
a little flare of the nostrils.

441
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:55,590
And then we've got this one
right here,

442
00:20:55,723 --> 00:20:58,126
which is
the something-you-want-to-say
quiet.

443
00:20:58,258 --> 00:21:00,460
Pursing of the lips,
distant look.

444
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:06,567
Whatever. I'm just worried
about Soto, aren't you?

445
00:21:06,701 --> 00:21:10,270
-Have you talked to her?
-No. I don't plan to.

446
00:21:12,673 --> 00:21:14,374
-That's it?
-Every cop's wired differently.

447
00:21:14,509 --> 00:21:16,443
If she wanted
to open up to me, she would.

448
00:21:16,577 --> 00:21:19,814
Okay, so your silence is just
"do nothing, say nothing."

449
00:21:20,581 --> 00:21:21,616
Yeah.

450
00:21:23,217 --> 00:21:25,586
Well, it's dumb,
and I don't care for it.

451
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:30,490
-Right back
to the pissed-at-me quiet.
-All right!

452
00:21:41,736 --> 00:21:44,005
Mr. Epps isn't expecting you,
so I have to ask him
if it's okay.

453
00:21:44,138 --> 00:21:46,808
It's okay
because I said it's okay. Okay?

454
00:21:46,941 --> 00:21:48,709
You know what?
Just let him do his thing.

455
00:21:48,843 --> 00:21:51,979
Otherwise he's gonna pull
his badge out, get all showy.
It's pretty annoying.

456
00:21:52,113 --> 00:21:53,380
-Hey, boss. We got--
-Mac Epps.

457
00:21:55,415 --> 00:21:57,952
- Detective Karadec, LAPD.
-  This is my-- -Yo, my man.

458
00:21:58,085 --> 00:22:00,788
I don't really care who you are
or whatever she is.

459
00:22:00,922 --> 00:22:03,490
Let me tell you how we do it
in the Black Jewel.

460
00:22:03,624 --> 00:22:06,493
Make an appointment, come back
during office hours. Cool?

461
00:22:06,627 --> 00:22:09,396
-Yeah, I don't think so.
-Oh, you can't.

462
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:11,732
Assaulting an officer
is a serious charge, son.

463
00:22:11,866 --> 00:22:14,467
I tried to warn you, didn't I?
I just... I just warned him.

464
00:22:14,602 --> 00:22:18,706
Thank you. Hi. Hi, I'm Morgan.

465
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,440
- Can I scooch?
- Hi. Yeah.

466
00:22:20,575 --> 00:22:24,679
I'm Julie. I love this jacket.
Girl, I see you,
your style is everything.

467
00:22:24,812 --> 00:22:25,880
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

468
00:22:26,013 --> 00:22:27,748
-Is this for everyone?
-You know what?

469
00:22:27,882 --> 00:22:30,284
I asked the same thing
when I got here
and I didn't get an answer,

470
00:22:30,417 --> 00:22:32,653
-so I've just been going in.
-You just jumped
right in anyway?

471
00:22:32,787 --> 00:22:35,056
-You got to. Mm-hmm.
-I like your style too.

472
00:22:35,189 --> 00:22:37,592
Do me a favor.
Ask your questions and go.

473
00:22:37,725 --> 00:22:40,561
Two names. Greta St. John,
Raina Viera.

474
00:22:41,729 --> 00:22:43,998
-What about 'em?
-They're both dead, Mac.

475
00:22:44,131 --> 00:22:46,634
Greta for 25 years,
case still cold.

476
00:22:46,767 --> 00:22:48,636
Raina, about 36 hours or so.

477
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:50,872
I mean, you got anything
to say about that, Mac?

478
00:22:51,005 --> 00:22:52,673
Nah, nothing.

479
00:22:52,807 --> 00:22:56,110
Huh. That's interesting because
you managed both of them.

480
00:22:56,244 --> 00:22:59,847
Matter of fact, you... you
bought Raina a house shortly
after Greta was murdered.

481
00:22:59,981 --> 00:23:01,182
Suspicious timing, you know?

482
00:23:01,315 --> 00:23:04,018
One thing has nothing to do
with the other.

483
00:23:04,151 --> 00:23:07,054
I made a deal with Raina.
A big one.

484
00:23:07,188 --> 00:23:09,957
I got the rights to her music
in exchange for the house.

485
00:23:10,091 --> 00:23:12,293
But you know what?
I lost my ass on that deal.

486
00:23:13,027 --> 00:23:15,730
Her career never took off,
but I let her have the place

487
00:23:16,297 --> 00:23:17,698
out of the goodness
of my heart.

488
00:23:17,832 --> 00:23:19,901
Aw. That's nice.

489
00:23:20,034 --> 00:23:23,470
Um, speaking of your heart,
you were more
than Greta's manager.

490
00:23:23,604 --> 00:23:26,439
She had a compass tattoo
on her wrist,
and I see that North Star.

491
00:23:26,574 --> 00:23:29,243
Perfect match.
Two tools of navigation.

492
00:23:29,377 --> 00:23:32,380
The compass leads the way.
The North Star holds steady.

493
00:23:32,513 --> 00:23:33,948
That's so romantic.

494
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:35,683
So maybe Greta
wasn't just walking away
from your business.

495
00:23:35,816 --> 00:23:37,450
Maybe she was walking away
from you.

496
00:23:37,585 --> 00:23:40,254
Something personal
went down after that
New Year's Eve celebration.

497
00:23:40,388 --> 00:23:43,658
Ball drops, confetti flies,
and then maybe a few
hours later, the next day--

498
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:45,259
You know what?
I've heard enough.

499
00:23:45,393 --> 00:23:49,297
Now, either y'all leave now,
or I'ma tag my lawyer in
on this.

500
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:53,367
JJ Pierce. They call him
"The Badge Collector."
Heard of him?

501
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,735
I haven't heard of JJ.

502
00:23:54,869 --> 00:23:56,771
-Have you heard
of nickel dermatitis?
-No.

503
00:23:56,904 --> 00:24:00,408
It's a reaction to cheap metals
like the ones
that are in foil confetti.

504
00:24:00,942 --> 00:24:03,110
<i>When I saw pictures of Greta</i>
<i>before midnight,</i>

505
00:24:03,244 --> 00:24:07,048
<i>her skin was so smooth</i>
<i>and clear, beautiful.</i>

506
00:24:07,882 --> 00:24:10,284
<i>But at midnight,</i>
<i>the ball dropped</i>
<i>and so did the confetti.</i>

507
00:24:13,486 --> 00:24:16,757
<i>And wherever the confetti</i>
<i>landed on her skin,</i>
<i>there were hives.</i>

508
00:24:16,891 --> 00:24:19,293
Nickel can trigger hives
very quickly,
in under a minute.

509
00:24:19,427 --> 00:24:21,262
<i>They were still there</i>
<i>in the autopsy photos.</i>

510
00:24:21,395 --> 00:24:23,664
You put all that together,
and what I'm saying is,

511
00:24:23,798 --> 00:24:27,368
Greta was murdered in this club
just a few hours
after midnight.

512
00:24:28,002 --> 00:24:29,870
-I'm done talking.
-Well,

513
00:24:30,004 --> 00:24:31,372
we're not done digging.

514
00:24:31,505 --> 00:24:33,674
I have a feeling
we'll see you again real soon.

515
00:24:33,808 --> 00:24:35,409
And next time, put out
some little share plates.

516
00:24:35,543 --> 00:24:37,578
-It's less confusing
and more sanitary.
-Morgan.

517
00:24:37,712 --> 00:24:38,946
Oh. See how many times

518
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,815
- I put my fingernails in there?
- Mm-hmm.

519
00:24:51,158 --> 00:24:53,861
I just got a call
from Epps's lawyer, JJ Pierce.

520
00:24:53,995 --> 00:24:55,529
What does The Badge Collector
have to say?

521
00:24:55,663 --> 00:24:58,733
That if we ever go back
to the Black Jewel
without a warrant,

522
00:24:58,866 --> 00:25:00,201
he will add to his collection.

523
00:25:00,334 --> 00:25:02,003
Well,
this is interesting.

524
00:25:02,136 --> 00:25:03,971
Soto, look at this picture.

525
00:25:05,172 --> 00:25:06,640
And this one a week later.

526
00:25:07,341 --> 00:25:09,543
And then this one
a month after that.

527
00:25:10,011 --> 00:25:11,012
Do you see what I see?

528
00:25:11,145 --> 00:25:13,581
-She had a baby.
-She had a baby.

529
00:25:13,714 --> 00:25:14,749
Um, I don't get it.

530
00:25:15,383 --> 00:25:16,917
Yeah, well,
that doesn't surprise me.

531
00:25:17,051 --> 00:25:18,719
Love you, LA.

532
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,889
<i>Nobody really</i>
<i>teaches you</i>
<i>about women's bodies.</i>

533
00:25:22,023 --> 00:25:24,191
<i>People think the party returns</i>
<i>when the pregnancy ends,</i>

534
00:25:24,325 --> 00:25:25,526
<i>but being postpartum sucks.</i>

535
00:25:27,261 --> 00:25:29,063
<i>Look, she's got a splint on</i>
<i>'cause she had mommy wrist.</i>

536
00:25:30,531 --> 00:25:33,667
<i>Repetitive hand</i>
<i>and wrist movements while</i>
<i>holding a baby can do that.</i>

537
00:25:33,801 --> 00:25:36,070
<i>She ditched the heels 'cause</i>
<i>you're not hauling around a kid</i>

538
00:25:36,203 --> 00:25:38,039
<i>and a diaper bag in high heels.</i>
<i>That's just dumb.</i>

539
00:25:38,172 --> 00:25:41,909
And then she started
styling her hair differently
because it was falling out.

540
00:25:42,043 --> 00:25:45,446
All of these are symptoms
of that three-month period
after a baby's born.

541
00:25:45,579 --> 00:25:47,081
It's called
the fourth trimester.

542
00:25:47,214 --> 00:25:50,017
And then when Epps
was behind bars,
Greta really found herself.

543
00:25:50,151 --> 00:25:53,487
I think
it's because she became a mom,
and to protect her child,

544
00:25:53,654 --> 00:25:56,057
she had to hide that baby
from a dangerous father.

545
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:58,759
She had Epps's baby,
and when he eventually
found out about the child,

546
00:25:58,893 --> 00:26:00,795
there was a confrontation
and he killed her.

547
00:26:00,928 --> 00:26:04,098
How do we prove
he pulled the trigger?
That gun is long gone.

548
00:26:04,765 --> 00:26:06,434
But maybe
it left something behind.

549
00:26:06,567 --> 00:26:08,135
Here's what I'm thinking.

550
00:26:08,269 --> 00:26:10,438
Look at all these pictures
of Epps. Do you see
his right hand?

551
00:26:12,206 --> 00:26:15,209
-Do you notice anything?
-Yeah, New Year's Eve, no scar.

552
00:26:15,342 --> 00:26:17,578
New Year's Day,
a bandaged hand.

553
00:26:17,711 --> 00:26:19,413
He hurt himself that night.

554
00:26:19,548 --> 00:26:22,116
That's right.
And Greta's autopsy photos,
the right side of her face.

555
00:26:22,983 --> 00:26:25,686
-Powder burns on her jaw.
-Yeah, given to her
from Epps's gun.

556
00:26:27,088 --> 00:26:28,722
<i>He shot her in the chest,</i>

557
00:26:28,856 --> 00:26:30,124
<i>but that wouldn't have</i>
<i>caused the powder burn</i>
<i>on her face,</i>

558
00:26:30,257 --> 00:26:31,592
<i>so he fired again.</i>

559
00:26:32,927 --> 00:26:35,496
<i>But that wouldn't have caused</i>
<i>the scar on his hand.</i>

560
00:26:36,531 --> 00:26:38,265
<i>An explosion would.</i>

561
00:26:38,399 --> 00:26:41,068
<i>The only way a gun explodes</i>
<i>is by firing it</i>
<i>after it was jammed.</i>

562
00:26:41,202 --> 00:26:42,903
<i>So the first shot</i>
<i>was to her chest,</i>

563
00:26:43,037 --> 00:26:44,772
<i>the second shot was a jam,</i>

564
00:26:44,905 --> 00:26:48,109
<i>and the third shot exploded,</i>
<i>ripping through his hand,</i>

565
00:26:49,076 --> 00:26:50,311
<i>and burning her face.</i>

566
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:54,448
<i>And Raina witnessed</i>
<i>the entire thing.</i>

567
00:26:54,583 --> 00:26:55,916
What did you do?

568
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,818
<i>Which explains</i>
<i>the blood on Raina's dress.</i>

569
00:26:57,952 --> 00:26:59,253
Greta!

570
00:27:00,454 --> 00:27:02,323
That scar
puts the murder weapon
in Epps's hand.

571
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:04,291
Looks like
The Badge Collector's
about to get his warrant.

572
00:27:04,425 --> 00:27:05,960
I'll get it within the hour.

573
00:27:06,093 --> 00:27:09,130
You go back to the club,
I'll get Daphne and Oz
to go to his home.

574
00:27:09,263 --> 00:27:11,499
- You stay here.
- What? No, I'm coming with you.

575
00:27:11,632 --> 00:27:13,834
-Morgan, it's not safe.
-I will be fine.

576
00:27:13,968 --> 00:27:16,437
Karadec, I need to see
the look on his smug face

577
00:27:16,571 --> 00:27:17,938
when he finds out
we got him for murder.

578
00:27:18,072 --> 00:27:19,508
I cannot risk you getting hurt
in a raid.

579
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,675
I'll bring in Greta's killer.
You find her child.

580
00:27:21,809 --> 00:27:23,978
Fine,
but when you get him--

581
00:27:24,111 --> 00:27:27,081
You'll see his smug face when
I put him in the box. Promise.

582
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:45,466
Excuse me. Move, move, move.
Excuse me.

583
00:27:50,271 --> 00:27:51,906
Epps!

584
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:54,742
Outta the way. Move, move.
Excuse me. Outta the way.

585
00:27:56,343 --> 00:27:58,779
Let me go!

586
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:05,886
-Put the gun down, Epps!
-Nah, I like where it is.

587
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,756
The place is surrounded.
The only way out for you
is in cuffs.

588
00:28:08,889 --> 00:28:11,458
You must be crazy if you think
I'm going back inside.

589
00:28:11,593 --> 00:28:14,529
You should have thought
about that before you killed
Greta St. John.

590
00:28:14,663 --> 00:28:16,830
Greta got exactly
what she deserved.

591
00:28:16,964 --> 00:28:22,203
You tell me what kind of woman
keeps a man
from his child, huh?

592
00:28:22,671 --> 00:28:25,406
For years,
I searched everywhere.

593
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,408
You stand down right now
and I promise you

594
00:28:27,542 --> 00:28:30,077
I will do everything I can
to help you find your child.

595
00:28:30,211 --> 00:28:33,881
It's too late! You stand down,
or she's gonna end up
just like Greta.

596
00:28:34,014 --> 00:28:36,951
If you do that, Mac,
you leave me no choice
but to respond.

597
00:28:40,421 --> 00:28:43,090
I'd rather be carried by six
than tried by 12.

598
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:45,759
Let's see who blinks first.

599
00:29:02,843 --> 00:29:06,046
Who's that guy?
I don't like him from out here.

600
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,781
-Internal Affairs.
-What?

601
00:29:07,915 --> 00:29:09,750
You discharge your weapon,
it's a big deal.

602
00:29:09,883 --> 00:29:11,986
He saved Julie's life,
and it's not like
he killed the guy.

603
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:14,188
Doesn't matter.
This is the process.

604
00:29:14,656 --> 00:29:15,956
Well, should I be worried?

605
00:29:18,593 --> 00:29:20,961
Epps killed Greta. I think
he killed Raina.
You can't expect me

606
00:29:21,095 --> 00:29:23,764
-to just sit at home.
-It's policy.

607
00:29:23,897 --> 00:29:27,736
You have to be cleared
by behavior science section
before you can return to work.

608
00:29:27,868 --> 00:29:30,971
Come on, Solomon.
You know how long
it takes to get an appointment.

609
00:29:31,105 --> 00:29:35,376
It's my job to make
sure you follow the rules,
not help you break them.

610
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:37,811
Okay, fine. So call and get me
on the books first thing.

611
00:29:37,945 --> 00:29:40,615
-That is not
breaking the rules.
-No, but it's bending them.

612
00:29:40,749 --> 00:29:42,349
And that is not my style.

613
00:29:42,483 --> 00:29:43,851
It used to not be yours.

614
00:29:46,253 --> 00:29:47,921
I wouldn't ask
if it wasn't important.

615
00:29:48,856 --> 00:29:50,324
Every case is important, Adam.

616
00:29:50,457 --> 00:29:52,426
I'm sorry. Policy is policy.

617
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,596
Doesn't policy say
that we withhold judgments

618
00:29:54,729 --> 00:29:57,632
and investigate every case
to the fullest extent
of the law, hmm?

619
00:29:57,766 --> 00:29:59,366
That didn't happen
for Greta St. John.

620
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,335
If the job had been done right,

621
00:30:01,468 --> 00:30:03,505
I wouldn't have had to pull
that trigger, and Raina Viera
would still be alive

622
00:30:03,638 --> 00:30:06,940
because Mac Epps would
have been in prison and
not out running the streets.

623
00:30:10,077 --> 00:30:12,146
What does policy say
about that?

624
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:21,488
Just this
once I will make the call.

625
00:30:22,757 --> 00:30:26,060
Thank you. Whatever time
they have, I'll be there.

626
00:30:26,193 --> 00:30:27,562
Then go with Morgan
to the impound.

627
00:30:27,696 --> 00:30:30,464
Check Epps's car for anything
tying him to Raina's murder.

628
00:30:30,598 --> 00:30:31,832
Yeah.

629
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:41,141
I've heard some things
about this consultant.

630
00:30:41,275 --> 00:30:43,911
Then you know
how invaluable she is.

631
00:30:44,044 --> 00:30:47,281
Her value comes
with a lot of things
that make me nervous.

632
00:30:48,449 --> 00:30:51,653
Kind of nervous that has me
looking at your reports
a bit more often.

633
00:30:52,286 --> 00:30:55,089
What happens with my squad
is none of your business.

634
00:30:57,057 --> 00:30:58,425
Till it is.

635
00:31:00,027 --> 00:31:02,697
Good night, Selena.

636
00:31:14,341 --> 00:31:16,443
Pretty clean car
for such a giant dirtbag.

637
00:31:16,578 --> 00:31:19,913
Let's just hope
we find something in here that
helps us prove he killed Raina.

638
00:31:21,616 --> 00:31:22,916
Hey, you okay?

639
00:31:23,884 --> 00:31:25,386
I'm fine. Why?

640
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,555
Because you just shot
somebody yesterday.

641
00:31:27,689 --> 00:31:29,724
You don't go from that to fine
in 24 hours.

642
00:31:30,257 --> 00:31:32,259
I told you it was a clean shot.
IA will clear me.

643
00:31:32,393 --> 00:31:35,563
I'm not worried
about your badge.
I'm worried about you.

644
00:31:36,997 --> 00:31:39,433
Typically when someone pretends
that something big
doesn't matter,

645
00:31:39,567 --> 00:31:41,168
it means that it really does.

646
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:45,038
You and Soto are doing a lot
of pretending that you're fine.

647
00:31:47,007 --> 00:31:49,611
A cop's worst nightmare
is having
to discharge their weapon.

648
00:31:50,344 --> 00:31:53,414
Yeah, I bet. How many times
have you done that?

649
00:31:54,014 --> 00:31:56,984
Three. But I never hit anyone
till now.

650
00:31:58,686 --> 00:32:01,656
Epps had a gun pressed
to a young woman's temple.

651
00:32:02,222 --> 00:32:04,692
He'd killed before, would have
had no problem doing it again,

652
00:32:04,826 --> 00:32:06,728
so I had exactly two options.

653
00:32:06,861 --> 00:32:09,764
Let him go or shoot him.
Knowing that if I missed--

654
00:32:09,898 --> 00:32:11,766
You might kill the person
you're trying to protect.

655
00:32:13,735 --> 00:32:16,270
How'd you do that?
Weren't you worried
you might accidentally hit her?

656
00:32:17,237 --> 00:32:20,240
Every morning
I start my day
at the gun range.

657
00:32:20,374 --> 00:32:22,409
Discipline. Repetition.

658
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:24,879
Endless hours
focused on one thought.

659
00:32:25,012 --> 00:32:27,247
What would I do if a day
like yesterday ever came?

660
00:32:27,381 --> 00:32:31,820
I'd seen that shot in my mind
every day for the last
20 years, and I took it.

661
00:32:33,588 --> 00:32:34,656
I knew I wouldn't miss.

662
00:32:49,136 --> 00:32:51,205
Check this out.
Some kind of pass.

663
00:32:51,338 --> 00:32:52,807
Monday is
when Raina was killed.

664
00:32:52,941 --> 00:32:54,809
It's a visitor's pass
to a federal prison.

665
00:32:54,943 --> 00:32:57,144
So Epps was visiting a prison
on Monday.

666
00:32:57,879 --> 00:32:59,379
California's got
13 federal prisons.

667
00:32:59,514 --> 00:33:01,716
I'll have Daphne and Oz
start calling each one.

668
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:04,853
Are there any near
the Mojave Desert? 'Cause
that's where this car was.

669
00:33:06,253 --> 00:33:10,123
Yucca moth. They're dependent
on Joshua trees for survival,

670
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:15,663
so if one
hit Epps's windshield,
this car was in the Mojave.

671
00:33:15,797 --> 00:33:19,066
Well, the only one
out that way is Victorville,
but it's a two-hour drive.

672
00:33:19,199 --> 00:33:21,536
Epps confessed to killing Greta
25 years ago.

673
00:33:21,669 --> 00:33:24,371
But if he was two hours away
in the desert
when Raina was killed...

674
00:33:24,506 --> 00:33:26,841
Then he's not our guy.

675
00:33:26,975 --> 00:33:30,845
All right, so...
...Raina helped Epps
cover up Greta's murder.

676
00:33:30,979 --> 00:33:32,479
Which is
why we've been thinking

677
00:33:32,614 --> 00:33:34,314
Epps pushed Raina
down the stairs to keep
Greta's murder a secret.

678
00:33:34,448 --> 00:33:36,350
But the prison
in Victorville confirmed
he was there

679
00:33:36,483 --> 00:33:37,652
at the time of Raina's murder.

680
00:33:37,785 --> 00:33:39,521
Mm-hmm. That means
Raina and Greta were killed

681
00:33:39,654 --> 00:33:41,523
by two different people
25 years apart.

682
00:33:41,656 --> 00:33:43,725
Okay, so if Raina's murder
wasn't about keeping secrets,

683
00:33:43,858 --> 00:33:45,025
maybe it was about revenge.

684
00:33:45,158 --> 00:33:46,895
You're thinking
someone found out Raina's role

685
00:33:47,027 --> 00:33:48,530
in Greta's murder
and then killed her.

686
00:33:48,663 --> 00:33:50,364
Yep, so now we need to be
thinking about family members.

687
00:33:50,497 --> 00:33:53,033
Maybe even Greta's child.
We still have no idea
what happened to the baby.

688
00:33:53,166 --> 00:33:55,469
Well, there was no record
of Greta giving birth in LA.

689
00:33:55,603 --> 00:33:56,571
She could've
used an alias.

690
00:33:56,704 --> 00:33:57,872
Or given birth
somewhere else entirely,

691
00:33:58,006 --> 00:33:59,741
making it nearly impossible
to find her child.

692
00:33:59,874 --> 00:34:03,343
Well, hang on,
I think I know exactly
what happened to Greta's kid.

693
00:34:04,077 --> 00:34:05,379
And to Raina.

694
00:34:10,484 --> 00:34:14,254
Detective, Ms. Gillory, uh,
is there news
about Raina's case?

695
00:34:14,388 --> 00:34:17,926
-Yes, we've had
a big break actually.
-Thought you'd like to know.

696
00:34:18,058 --> 00:34:19,794
We finally know who killed her.

697
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,930
That's great.

698
00:34:24,666 --> 00:34:25,800
It's you.

699
00:34:25,934 --> 00:34:29,571
What? I loved Raina.

700
00:34:29,704 --> 00:34:31,739
That might be true,
but you also killed her.

701
00:34:31,873 --> 00:34:34,742
I couldn't have killed her.
I told you I was at work.

702
00:34:34,876 --> 00:34:36,744
Right. You said that,
at the time of the murder,

703
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:38,947
you were taking pictures
at Griffith Observatory.

704
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:41,583
<i>With one</i>
<i>of your cameras that has</i>
<i>the built-in time stamp.</i>

705
00:34:43,017 --> 00:34:46,119
You know what's more reliable
than a time stamp? The sun.

706
00:34:46,253 --> 00:34:48,790
<i>A couple cool things about</i>
<i>the Griffith Observatory:</i>

707
00:34:48,923 --> 00:34:52,627
The observation deck has these
bronze lines built into it,

708
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,129
<i>and it shows you the position</i>
<i>of the sun in the sky</i>
<i>throughout the year.</i>

709
00:34:56,631 --> 00:35:00,167
<i>And that weird ring sculpture</i>
<i>with the wire through it,</i>

710
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,070
<i>that's actually a sundial.</i>

711
00:35:02,202 --> 00:35:05,472
So your time stamp said you
took those pictures at noon
on a Monday,

712
00:35:05,607 --> 00:35:09,711
but the sun tells me
they were taken around
3 p.m.-ish last December.

713
00:35:09,844 --> 00:35:10,945
This is crazy.

714
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:12,614
-No, it's not crazy.
-It's science.

715
00:35:12,747 --> 00:35:14,782
And we can prove
you're the one
that pushed Raina.

716
00:35:14,916 --> 00:35:17,619
Raina had a smudge
on the back of her shirt,
drove my partner here crazy.

717
00:35:17,752 --> 00:35:19,453
Yeah, I couldn't figure out
what that stain was.

718
00:35:19,587 --> 00:35:21,723
So once again, your profession
was your undoing.

719
00:35:21,856 --> 00:35:23,591
Turns out
it was silver nitrate,

720
00:35:23,725 --> 00:35:26,360
something photographers
like yourself use when
you're developing pictures.

721
00:35:26,493 --> 00:35:29,162
You must have had
a small amount of it on your
hands when you pushed her.

722
00:35:29,296 --> 00:35:31,833
The only question was
why would she do that?

723
00:35:31,966 --> 00:35:35,103
Why would you kill Raina?
You said she was
like a second mother to you.

724
00:35:35,235 --> 00:35:37,839
We're guessing that all
went out the window as soon
as you realized

725
00:35:37,972 --> 00:35:40,074
she was lying to you
about your actual mother,
Greta St. John.

726
00:35:40,207 --> 00:35:41,776
The last time
we were here,

727
00:35:41,909 --> 00:35:45,178
you said that Epps terrorized
Greta's family for decades.

728
00:35:45,312 --> 00:35:48,082
It's not something
you would know, Lucy,
not unless you were family.

729
00:35:48,215 --> 00:35:51,953
Unless you were the reason
that Greta made
all those sacrifices.

730
00:35:55,288 --> 00:35:59,159
I just came here searching
for answers
about what happened to my mom.

731
00:35:59,292 --> 00:36:02,295
Yes, I found Raina, and
I kept my identity a secret.

732
00:36:02,429 --> 00:36:03,865
But then she...

733
00:36:03,998 --> 00:36:07,769
...started having
all these episodes,
because of her dementia.

734
00:36:08,235 --> 00:36:12,106
That's when she confessed to me
that she was a part
of covering up my mom's death.

735
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:13,775
But she wouldn't give you
the whole story.

736
00:36:13,908 --> 00:36:17,177
No, and...
...I find out that
Mac Epps is my dad,

737
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:19,714
and that
he probably killed her.

738
00:36:19,847 --> 00:36:23,584
So I just wanted Raina
to tell me the truth
about what happened.

739
00:36:23,718 --> 00:36:27,187
So I did. I confronted her,
but then she just...

740
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:30,825
she flipped out on me,
threatened to never speak
to me again.

741
00:36:31,324 --> 00:36:34,062
<i>I snapped.</i>

742
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:43,336
Look, I swear...
...I swear I did not mean
to kill her.

743
00:36:44,138 --> 00:36:47,709
Lucy, we got justice
for your mom, and now we have
to do the same thing for Raina.

744
00:36:47,842 --> 00:36:49,844
Oh, my God.

745
00:36:49,977 --> 00:36:53,280
You're under arrest
for the murder
of Raina Viera.

746
00:37:00,822 --> 00:37:02,857
Come on. This way.

747
00:37:12,166 --> 00:37:16,037
Seriously, Gillory?
We can get you a computer.

748
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:18,039
I'll go get it myself.

749
00:37:18,172 --> 00:37:21,209
How am I gonna make you nervous
about your search history
if I'm on my own computer?

750
00:37:21,341 --> 00:37:22,375
Mmm.

751
00:37:25,913 --> 00:37:27,148
Y-You were right.

752
00:37:29,349 --> 00:37:32,220
I'm sorry. Could you say
that again? I didn't hear you.

753
00:37:33,888 --> 00:37:35,523
What was I right about?

754
00:37:36,256 --> 00:37:38,893
I've been taking care
of myself for a long time.

755
00:37:39,026 --> 00:37:42,964
So long that sometimes I forget
what it's like to have
somebody looking out for me.

756
00:37:43,931 --> 00:37:46,601
You were right about me
not going to the Black Jewel.

757
00:37:46,734 --> 00:37:50,571
Certain things
a police consultant
does not need to be around.

758
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,076
-You were right too.
-Oh, yeah?

759
00:37:55,209 --> 00:38:00,248
Mm-hmm. My "do nothing,
say nothing" silence,
it's not optimal.

760
00:38:01,949 --> 00:38:03,918
You have no plans
to change that, do you?

761
00:38:04,051 --> 00:38:07,021
Well, I don't need to.
I've got you.

762
00:38:13,393 --> 00:38:14,896
Something else?

763
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:17,799
Yeah, one last thing.

764
00:38:42,455 --> 00:38:44,258
You're allowed
to be pissed with me.

765
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,828
-Morgan, what did you do?
-Nothing.

766
00:38:46,961 --> 00:38:49,429
No, I didn't mean you're
allowed to be pissed at me.

767
00:38:49,564 --> 00:38:51,232
You can. You're my boss.

768
00:38:51,364 --> 00:38:53,167
You can do whatever you want,
but that's not
what I'm talking about.

769
00:38:53,301 --> 00:38:56,469
I feel like I lost track of
this conversation
before it started.

770
00:39:01,474 --> 00:39:03,476
Despite your
overwhelming qualifications,

771
00:39:03,611 --> 00:39:05,513
you were passed over
for captain.

772
00:39:05,646 --> 00:39:08,816
And I have to assume
that part of you wonders
if that has anything to do

773
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:10,518
with you being a woman.

774
00:39:10,651 --> 00:39:12,854
-Because if it were me--
-You would have gone
scorched earth.

775
00:39:12,987 --> 00:39:16,190
Oh, absolutely,
and I would have loved
every single second of it,

776
00:39:16,324 --> 00:39:18,292
so they're lucky
that you're not me.

777
00:39:18,993 --> 00:39:20,228
You're you.

778
00:39:21,361 --> 00:39:23,965
You gotta be strong
for everybody out there.

779
00:39:24,098 --> 00:39:25,700
I understand that.

780
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,536
One of the beautiful things
about me not being a cop is--

781
00:39:28,669 --> 00:39:31,438
Is that
I can be pissed with you.

782
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:34,942
Anything you need.
Anytime you need it.

783
00:39:35,977 --> 00:39:37,444
I could just be your friend.

784
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,521
I'm pissed.
It should have been me.

785
00:39:50,291 --> 00:39:51,359
Yeah.

786
00:39:54,394 --> 00:39:56,931
This never happened.

787
00:39:57,665 --> 00:40:01,068
I never even cared in
the first place. I don't know
what you're talking about.

788
00:40:17,251 --> 00:40:18,686
-Hi.
-Hi.

789
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:23,124
All I want is
to enter my house justified.

790
00:40:25,192 --> 00:40:26,193
Okay.

791
00:40:26,761 --> 00:40:28,629
It's just a line from
an old western I love.

792
00:40:28,763 --> 00:40:31,132
Mmm.
It's a line from the Bible.

793
00:40:32,333 --> 00:40:35,136
That's right, it is.
Peckinpah stole it.

794
00:40:36,436 --> 00:40:38,005
Anyway,
it's my clumsy way of saying

795
00:40:38,139 --> 00:40:40,675
you look like somebody
who's proud
of a good day's work.

796
00:40:42,643 --> 00:40:44,512
Thank you. I am.

797
00:40:45,445 --> 00:40:47,415
I'm also so tired
I might fall asleep in my car.

798
00:40:47,548 --> 00:40:50,418
All I want is to fall asleep
in my car justified.

799
00:41:01,562 --> 00:41:04,198
So what's someone like you
doing in a police station?

800
00:41:04,332 --> 00:41:06,267
Trying to get that mustache
to make sense?

801
00:41:08,903 --> 00:41:10,004
That's good.

802
00:41:11,005 --> 00:41:12,440
I've heard about you.

803
00:41:14,108 --> 00:41:16,344
-Excuse me?
-Morgan Gillory, right?

804
00:41:17,211 --> 00:41:19,180
Major Crime's secret weapon.

805
00:41:21,248 --> 00:41:24,852
I didn't mean to freak you out.
I've just been
looking forward to meeting you.

806
00:41:27,655 --> 00:41:28,756
Okay.

807
00:41:31,726 --> 00:41:34,161
-Are you not getting off?
-Nah, I was supposed
