00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,302

been stolen by the vic.

No, she didn't steal Tori
Nolan's car. She is Tori Nolan.

some work done recently.

cheek fillers, eyelash extensions.

She chopped her hair
off and dyed it brown.

94

Sounds like she went through a lot
of trouble to change her appearance.

95
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,552
Yeah, either she succumbed to the
pressures of being a woman in LA,

-or she was hiding from someone.
-Mmm.

came from a small caliber, maybe a .380.

her face, carried a gun,

and dumped into a pond.

it because, you know,

I'm banned from most of them,
but that's not why we're here.

115

Tori had a storage unit, right?

-Yeah.
-Okay.

118
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:19,754
Nobody's popping into the
Hula Hound for no reason,

119
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:21,756
and I'm thinking Tori's
reason was proximity.

120
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,550
Yeah, it's as good a
place to start as any.

121

address was in Koreatown,

there was some sort of big scandal.

was running a human trafficking

what'd you find out?

the location,

156

numbers you sent.

157
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,221
Morgan was right. Tori was a
journalist for Takedown Magazine,

158
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,974
an online publication
known for its exposés.

159

always wrote under a pseudonym.

she published in her college newspaper.

Having her private information
blasted all over the Internet

was so traumatic she
dropped out of school.

Did the editor know what Tori
was currently investigating?

No, but that wasn't unusual.

165

She said Tori would drop off

00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:06,713
[Morgan] This is recent. She had
the same nails on when she died.

170
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,673
There's no grow-out
around the cuticles.

171
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,676
But this picture could have
been taken anywhere, Morgan.

172
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,720
There's no landmarks or anything
else in the background we can use.

173
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,430
Not true.

174
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,973
You got a poodle dog.

175
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,144
There's literally no poodle.

176
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:27,358
Okay, I get it.

177
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:31,071
We're looking for poodle dog plants, but
how do you know this is the right area?

178
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:34,866
Because there was a fire in these
hills just a few months ago.

179
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:38,203
Poodle dog bushes are
pyrophytes. Fire followers.

180
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:41,956
Their seeds lay dormant until the
intense heat of a fire wakes them up.

181
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,459
Based on the size of the plant
in this picture she took.

182
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,586
This location fits the timeline.

183
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,465
Yeah, yeah, yeah, look. Look,
we're getting close. See?

184
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,592
Okay, stop. Check it out.

185
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,886
-She took the picture right here.
-[Karadec] Hmm.

186
00:09:55,595 --> 00:10:00,475
Okay, if I am Tori, I am not taking
no trespassing for an answer.

187
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:01,559
If you're Tori?

188
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,564
Well, why would I? Any bozo can
buy a sign, tack it to a fence.

189
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:08,233
Morgan, whoever put up that
sign, they might mean it.

190
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:11,528
Tori's embedded herself in some dangerous
situations with some dangerous people,

191
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,738
so we don't know what we
might be walking into here.

192
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:17,075
[♪ "Wanna Go Wild" playing]

193
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:23,957
What is this place?

194
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,542
Oh, you don't have a teenager.

195
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:27,836
This is a content house.

196
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,511
[chuckles]

197
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,266
[screams, laughs]

198
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,312
These guys all live here and shoot
videos for their streaming platforms.

199
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,356
Could explain
Tori's enhancements.

200
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:52,443
She'd have to be camera ready 24-7 if she
was going undercover as an influencer.

201
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:56,281
[Karadec] Mmm. Well, this isn't really on
par with the other stories she went after.

202
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,782
What was she investigating here?

203
00:10:58,950 --> 00:10:59,951
Can I help you?

204
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,620
I'm Detective Karadec. This
is Morgan Gillory, LAPD.

205
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,039
You recognize this woman?

206
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,167
That's Darla.

207
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,878
She lives here.

208
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,047
Is she okay?

209
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:16,301
No, unfortunately
she's not. She's dead.

210
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:20,889
Hey. Anyone else want to
take a dip in the gel-cuzzi?

211
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,477
Uh, that's a no?

212
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,314
[creator 1] Darla…
Well, Tori, I guess,

213
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,942
she'd only been in the house a
few weeks, but everyone liked her.

214
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,736
-What kind of content did she make?
-ASMR videos.

215
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,071
Her channel wasn't doing
great, but it was growing.

216
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,865
[Karadec] When's the
last time you saw Tori?

217
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,867
[creator 3] A day
ago, maybe two.

218
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,620
When everyone's filming, we
tend to lose track of time.

219
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,580
[Karadec] Do you know anyone
who would want to hurt her?

220
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,541
[creator 2] No, we've all
had creeps in our comments,

221
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,876
but Tori never mentioned
anyone she was concerned about.

222
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,170
Do you think one of her
followers killed her?

223
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,755
Well, we're not
ruling anything out.

224
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,173
Thanks. We'll be in touch.

225
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:58,134
[sighs] No one claims
to know what happened.

226
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,886
You got anything?

227
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,680
Just that these kids are under
a crazy amount of pressure.

228
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:04,766
You know, that bit
that Prénkz was doing?

229
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,810
A six-ounce box of
gelatin makes two cups.

230
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,730
A standard kiddie pool
is about 400 gallons.

231
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,608
That's 3,360 boxes
just to fill it up.

232
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:16,694
I'm guessing from set-up
to clean-up, that's what?

233
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:19,072
Thirty hours of work
for a 30-second video.

234
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,576
That's barely gonna move the
needle on his goal chart.

235
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:25,411
This guy Phineas is running
this place like a sweatshop.

236
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,670
-Okay. Looks like we found Prénkz's lair.
-[toy squeaks]

237
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,467
Red dye?

238
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,511
Like the red dye that
was all over Tori's body?

239
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,805
[creator 3] What are you gonna
say? You don't know what happened.

240
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,432
-Just let me talk!
-Play it cool. Okay, we're going in.

241
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:48,643
Something you guys
wanna tell us?

242
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:52,438
-We did it. We did it. We killed her.
-Uh. It was an accident.

243
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:53,731
One of you shot Tori?

244
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,149
She was shot?

245
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:56,734
How do you think you killed her?

246
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:58,111
Like that.

247
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,613
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no. No. Karadec!

248
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:01,865
-You might wanna turn back.
-What…

249
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,950
-[Morgan screams] Oh!
-[Prénkz] Oh, geez.

250
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:21,718
Darla, um, Tori leaves the house every
Wednesday afternoon to do errands.

251
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:26,848
Since we knew she'd be in her car, Prénkz
and I set up a situation in her back seat.

252
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,434
What kind of a situation?

253
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,311
The devil's toothpaste.

254
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:34,772
Exactly what happened to
Detective Karadec, except bigger.

255
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,526
Show me.

256
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,945
[Raquel chuckling on laptop]

257
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,239
[Prénkz chuckles] Get ready.

258
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,241
[chuckles] This is
gonna get so many hits.

259
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,744
[creator 3] Sorry, Darla,
but you asked for this.

260
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,956
-[explosion]
-[creator 3] Oh, my God.

261
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,583
-[Prénkz] What do we do?
-I don't know.

262
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,086
[Prénkz] Hurry, the car's still
rolling. We need to get outta here.

263
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,920
[creator 3] Just
stop filming, Prénkz!

264
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,422
Did you check on her?

265
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,716
Well, we freaked out, so we
called Phineas. [exhales]

266
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:02,967
He runs Cloud House.

267
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:04,844
Phineas said Darla was
fine but really mad.

268
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,596
She was just gonna go
for a drive and cool off.

269
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,390
No, with a force like that,
Tori was definitely concussed.

270
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:10,641
She wasn't driving anywhere.

271
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:13,478
You guys, that was a
really dangerous prank.

272
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:16,230
I know. I didn't think it'd
be that big of an explosion.

273
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:17,482
All right, what was in it?

274
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:21,277
Just dye, soap,
yeast, and peroxide.

275
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,862
-How much peroxide?
-A lot.

276
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,073
A lot. Okay, well, that
explains the steam burns.

277
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:28,117
When hydrogen
peroxide meets yeast,

278
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:31,788
it produces a lot of
oxygen and a lot of heat.

279
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,540
The oxygen forms
a fabulous foam,

280
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:38,836
and the higher the peroxide
percentage, the bigger the boom.

281
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,254
[explosion]

282
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,009
It also explains the lack
of blood in Tori's car.

283
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:45,385
The peroxide would
have cleaned it up.

284
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:46,594
Mmm.

285
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:49,097
In the video, you said
Tori asked for it. Why?

286
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:52,183
She stole my L3 protein powder.

287
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,434
Live Laugh Lift.

288
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:55,520
I was supposed to do an
exclusive promo for them.

289
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:58,564
I'm the only content creator in the
country to get L3 before the launch.

290
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:01,109
It was gonna bring a ton
of traffic to my channel,

291
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:03,277
but Tori stole the powder
before I could film it.

292
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:04,403
Why would she do that?

293
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,823
Probably because her own
channel wasn't doing so well,

294
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,282
so she wanted to sabotage mine.

295
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,161
Those morons could've killed
Tori with that dumb prank,

296
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,497
but I don't think they shot
her. I think someone else did.

297
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:19,919
Look, red dye and tire tracks
extend down into those weeds.

298
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,796
I think this is
where Tori was shot.

299
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,798
[car approaches]

300
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,595
Wonder who would've
wanted to do that.

301
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,811
[tires squeal]

302
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,896
Let's get back to the
car. I'll put out a BOLO.

303
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,731
Hold on… [chuckles] …one second.

304
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,817
Did you just try and
chase after a sports car?

305
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,901
It was an instinct.

306
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:47,155
Your instinct was that you could
catch up to a twin-turbo V-8?

307
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:49,657
-Morgan.
-This might be the best day of my life.

308
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,908
[Karadec] Uh-huh.

309
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:52,744
I just wanna thank you
for that beautiful gift.

310
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:53,828
[Karadec] Okay.

311
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:57,707
[door opens]

312
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,208
[door closes]

313
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,335
We didn't know
you'd be home early.

314
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,838
Clearly. What is this?

315
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,339
Oh, a PB and J.

316
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:06,799
Cookies are not bread.

317
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:10,178
Argh. Air patrol's out looking
for a guy, so I got a little time.

318
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:12,555
That's so cool. You should
have asked for a fly along.

319
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,099
Mmm. I prefer to do
my barfing on land.

320
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:16,184
[Chloe cries]

321
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:18,436
Hey, uh, Elliot, can
you go grab your sister?

322
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,146
I thought you were
hiring a babysitter.

323
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,898
Can you just go get her?

324
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,067
Please? You're her favorite
person in the whole wide world.

325
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,902
I know you're just saying
that to manipulate me.

326
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,069
Is it working?

327
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,781
Yes, but only because it's
true. She's a big Elliot fan.

328
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:33,492
-Aren't we all?
-Mmm. He's all right.

329
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,246
Argh. Gross.

330
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,251
The other reason I wanted
to swing by home was

331
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:45,671
to let you know that I tracked
down Arthur this morning.

332
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,340
-The guy who knows my dad?
-Mm-hmm.

333
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,799
Does he know where he is?

334
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:51,135
No, but he did agree to
give me his backpack.

335
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:53,554
-Okay, let's go get it.
-Hey… [chuckles] …hold on a second.

336
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:55,973
We haven't figured out
a time or a place yet,

337
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:58,267
but when we do, I
will get the backpack.

338
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,019
-I can't go with you?
-No.

339
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:03,189
-Why not?
-We don't even know who this guy is.

340
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,774
I'm not letting him
anywhere near you. No.

341
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,026
-But, Mom, what if he has information or…
-Ava.

342
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:08,819
It's not a negotiation.

343
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:11,322
[softly] Okay.

344
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:13,950
I'll keep you posted.

345
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,584
[Daphne] Phineas's orange
Lamborghini wasn't hard to find.

346
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:26,212
Highway patrol picked him
up in Ventura an hour ago.

347
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,880
So far he's had nothing to say.

348
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:31,008
Keeping his mouth shut is probably the
smartest thing he's done in a while.

349
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:32,093
[Daphne] Mm-hmm.

350
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:34,345
I'm not interrupting, am I?

351
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:38,224
No, Detectives Oz and Karadec
are letting Phineas sweat a bit

352
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,309
before starting
their interrogation.

353
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,728
Good. So Detective
Forrester has a minute.

354
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:46,566
I hope you don't mind, but I stopped
at your desk and I couldn't resist.

355
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,192
No, that's what
they're there for.

356
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,696
I never had a sweet tooth…
[exhales] …until I joined the force.

357
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,823
Now I can't go a day
without having sugar.

358
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,741
Oh, well, there is worse habits.

359
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:59,203
True, and there's some habits
that serve you well on your job.

360
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:00,746
I saw your file, Detective.

361
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,041
Have you ever considered
sitting for the sergeant's exam?

362
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,921
[stutters] Y-Yeah, I thought
about it, but nothing serious.

363
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:12,466
You should. I have a friend
that used to be a test assessor.

364
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:15,177
He can give you tips, get you
the right study materials.

365
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:18,806
That's great, but you know,
I'm really happy here and...

366
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,058
No, of course you are,
but it never hurts to

367
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:23,978
be curious about
broadening your horizons.

368
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,063
I'm sure Lieutenant
Soto would agree.

369
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,525
-I do.
-I love to hear it.

370
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:32,153
-I'll set it up.
-Thank you.

371
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,325
What did I miss?

372
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:39,744
Nothing. They haven't started
the interrogation yet,

373
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,621
but I'm glad you
popped in, Morgan.

374
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:44,040
I was hoping we could sit down
and have that talk and see...

375
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,584
Ye… Oh. You know
what, I-I… Great.

376
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,253
I can't though 'cause I gotta
give this my attention, so later.

377
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:51,047
[Phineas] Maybe someone can
tell me what this is about.

378
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,131
Maybe.

379
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:53,841
Of course.

380
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:57,094
-Let's talk about Tori Nolan.
-Who?

381
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:58,972
The reporter you shot and
then dumped in a pond.

382
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:01,391
We're thinking you found out
she was embedded at your house.

383
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:04,435
You were worried about the story
she'd run, and so you got rid of her.

384
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:05,519
You mean Darla?

385
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,521
So the details are
familiar but not the name.

386
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:09,315
I d-didn't know that was Darla.

387
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,734
I-I definitely didn't know
that she was a reporter.

388
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:12,819
Why was she at Cloud House?

389
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:14,779
We were wondering the same
thing, but then we had a look

390
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:15,863
at your financials.

391
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,491
-$200,000 sports car.
-Mmm.

392
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:21,160
Several stays at the
Ibiza Four Seasons.

393
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,621
You work the kids hard, pay them
way less than they're earning,

394
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,039
then skim all the
profits for yourself.

395
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,207
That sounds like a story to me.

396
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,960
Any money that I take from the
creators is for their room and board.

397
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:31,837
Right. 50K a month each.

398
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,423
Seems a bit steep,
doesn't it, Phineas?

399
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:34,924
Even by Los Angeles standards.

400
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,511
-I gotta do a quick mic pop.
-A what?

401
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:40,971
[Morgan] I need
to see his watch.

402
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:42,264
[Karadec] Watch, please.

403
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:43,432
Thank you.

404
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:49,522
Check out the joints. There's
corrosion in there, you see that?

405
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:53,609
That's what happens when titanium comes
in contact with concentrated peroxide.

406
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,321
Ooh. You see, after the explosion,
Tori was covered in that, Phineas,

407
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,657
and you must have gotten a
good bit of it on yourself too

408
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,159
when you moved her body
from the driver's seat.

409
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:05,121
You were in Tori's car after
Raquel and Prénkz foamed it.

410
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,832
You're the one who shot
her and then moved the car.

411
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:14,171
[inhales] I moved the body,
but I swear I did not kill her.

412
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:15,840
Uh. There was so
much foam everywhere.

413
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,259
I had no idea that she was
shot until I got to the pond.

414
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,594
If you didn't kill her,
why'd you move the body?

415
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,805
Because I'd lose the
lease on the house.

416
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,933
Landlord's been trying to
evict Cloud House for months.

417
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,018
The neighbors hate us,
and if they kick us out,

418
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:29,812
I'd have to shut the
entire thing down.

419
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,481
-Can you prove that you didn't kill her?
-I can.

420
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,108
[stutters] Do you guys
know what bots are?

421
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,860
Fake account holders
on social networks.

422
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,528
People use them to pad
their followers. Yeah.

423
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:41,657
Exactly. Darla's number...
Tori's numbers were terrible,

424
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:45,411
and right before Prénkz
and Raquel came running up,

425
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:48,581
I was in my office buying bots
to pump up Tori's channel.

426
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,833
Which you never would have done

427
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,877
if you were planning on getting
rid of her a minute later.

428
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,003
Exactly.

429
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:57,798
Damn it.

430
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:08,601
We booked Phineas for evidence
tampering and illegal transport.

431
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:11,479
He offered up Tori's bag as a
bargaining chip for leniency.

432
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:13,814
Said he took it to keep
anyone from ID'ing her.

433
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:16,484
Somebody who loves cars didn't think we
could find her through her VIN number?

434
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:18,486
[Oz] Come on.

435
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,031
Great. Tori has state-of-the-art
encryption on here.

436
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,741
Not surprising for
someone with her job.

437
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:28,829
[Morgan] Raquel was right. Tori
did steal the protein powder.

438
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:30,581
But why? I checked Tori's
Cloud House channel.

439
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,667
-She never advertised it.
-Yeah, well, why would she?

440
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,377
She didn't actually
care about her numbers,

441
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,670
which means she wouldn't
sabotage somebody else's.

442
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:37,880
Morgan, how about this?

443
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,924
You recognize anything
in these lab results?

444
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,762
Yeah, nothing super
interesting, except castoreum.

445
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,555
-What's that?
-Beaver butt secretion.

446
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,766
It's a flavoring agent.

447
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:51,477
So is ethyl
methylphenylglycidate.

448
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,561
Artificial strawberry.

449
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:55,773
I know that from my weekly fight
with my kids in the cereal aisle.

450
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:57,358
Yep.

451
00:21:58,526 --> 00:21:59,527
Strawberry.

452
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,363
Okay, so Tori wasn't
investigating the content house,

453
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:05,032
she was investigating
the protein powder. Why?

454
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:08,661
Yeah, the woman made a career
out of exposing major scandals.

455
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,579
She covered corruption.

456
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:13,040
-She saved animals from abuse.
-[horse whinnies]

457
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:16,418
[Morgan] She took on big
oil. And then protein powder?

458
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:18,754
Going after a small-time
product doesn't make any sense.

459
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:23,551
We said she was doxed, right?

460
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:25,553
Yeah, she wrote an
article about a classmate

461
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:27,638
who was running a
test-taker-for-hire business.

462
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,223
He cyberbullied her for revenge.

463
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:32,393
His name was, um, Robert Romano.

464
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,354
Well, I think he
goes by Bobby now.

465
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,615
-Thank you.
-Robert Romano?

466
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,618
Whoa, my full name.

467
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:52,663
That's what my mom calls me
when I'm in trouble. [chuckles]

468
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:56,584
-Wait, am I in trouble?
-No, we just wanna talk.

469
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:58,085
It's an impressive
operation you got here.

470
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:01,380
Thanks, man. Yeah, it's
exciting times at L3.

471
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:02,756
Yeah, our pre-orders are flying.

472
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,384
I'm trying to stay humble,
but I got a feeling

473
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:08,512
Live Laugh Lift is gonna
revolutionize the fitness industry.

474
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,639
Really?

475
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:13,392
Oh. 'Cause it kind of looks
like you're just repackaging

476
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:17,146
a bunch of bulk protein powder from
China and slapping your label on it.

477
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,315
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. [chuckles]
It's way more than that.

478
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,941
-Is it?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

479
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:23,944
L3 is a movement, okay? This
guy gets it. I can tell.

480
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:26,447
Bobby, San Dimas delivery
is gonna be late.

481
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,198
The truck got a flat.

482
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:31,494
If you two are from the health department,
our certifications are in compliance.

483
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:34,017
Don't worry, they're not health
inspectors. They're just cops.

484
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:38,375
Guys, this is Lamar Vulpis.
He's my operations manager.

485
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:40,002
Can we help you with something?

486
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,712
Yeah, we were hoping to
take a look around, Lamar.

487
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,130
Sure, you got a warrant?

488
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:45,550
I don't know. Is there something
here that warrants a warrant?

489
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:48,928
Whoa, no, no. We don't… They don't
need a warrant, dude. [chuckles]

490
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,721
-We're just talking, right?
-That's right.

491
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,682
Yeah. Look, Lamar,
I'll call San Dimas.

492
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:55,809
-You got it, Boss.
-[Bobby] Okay, thank you.

493
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:01,273
I know, he seems pretty tough,
right? That's just his job.

494
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:02,650
I couldn't run the
place without him.

495
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:03,984
Hmm -Yeah, I don't doubt it.

496
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:06,320
I mean, your other businesses
were all scams, right?

497
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,823
Designer shoe company that turned
out to be low-end knockoffs.

498
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:10,950
The concert app that was
kicking out fraudulent tickets.

499
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:12,743
Oh, yeah. That one got you
pinched for wire fraud.

500
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:13,995
You did two years
in prison, right?

501
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:17,331
Mm-hmm. Yeah, the feds got interested
in you because of an anonymous tip,

502
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:19,917
but she wasn't so
anonymous for you, was she?

503
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,170
-Yeah, you're talking about Tori Nolan?
-Hmm.

504
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:25,089
-She just has it out for me.
-Oh, yeah?

505
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:27,550
You think it had anything to do
with the time you doxed her so bad

506
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:29,009
she had to drop out of school?

507
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:30,886
I really regret that.

508
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,682
I was a stupid kid, and
I did stupid things.

509
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,144
[Bobby sighs]

510
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:40,688
Please.

511
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,899
So, why are you
asking about Tori?

512
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:46,568
Well, Bobby, um, she's dead.

513
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,323
[huffs] That's heavy.

514
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:52,866
[Karadec] Mm-hmm.

515
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:55,620
Wait, you don't think I had
something to do with it?

516
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:56,704
Strong and smart.

517
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:58,789
-He's the whole package.
-Thanks.

518
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,499
When's the last time you
had contact with Tori?

519
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,084
Well, she called me a week ago.

520
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,211
She told me she was
this big reporter now,

521
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:06,505
and she was gonna take me
down for good this time.

522
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:08,507
-Well, how was she gonna do that?
-I have no idea.

523
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,591
I hung up on her.

524
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:12,386
That kind of negative energy is not
what Live Laugh Lift is all about.

525
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:16,015
It's nonsense anyway,
because L3 is legit. [scoffs]

526
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:18,851
Okay, so that must have really pissed you
off, that she was trying to take it down.

527
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,145
I wouldn't hurt anyone.

528
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:23,439
You can look around all
you want. I'm an open book.

529
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,360
-Morgan…
-Karadec, he's an open book.

530
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:31,321
-Yeah, I'm cool with it.
-He's cool with it.

531
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:35,325
He was at a gym across
town when Tori was shot.

532
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,579
Because I never skip leg day.

533
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:40,706
-Can you verify that?
-Yes.

534
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:48,672
Oh, you meant, like, an alibi.

535
00:25:48,756 --> 00:25:51,050
Yeah, my pump partner
can vouch for me.

536
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:54,053
Oh, God, this keeps
getting better.

537
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:57,306
I'll check out Bobby's alibi,
see if the gym had cameras.

538
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,184
You're saying you don't trust
the word of his pump partner?

539
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:01,685
Well, even if his story is true,

540
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:03,646
it doesn't mean he had nothing
to do with Tori's death.

541
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:05,898
-He could've hired someone to kill her.
-Yeah, maybe.

542
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,608
His nav app doesn't have
him going to Cloud House,

543
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,651
however it does say
that he stops by a place

544
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:11,737
called Serenity Arms
at least once a week.

545
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,280
-[Karadec] Mmm.
-It sounds like a cult.

546
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:15,199
No, actually, it's a
halfway house for ex-cons.

547
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:17,118
Maybe Bobby stayed there
after he got out of prison.

548
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:18,744
Might be a good place
to get some confirmation

549
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,245
as to how reformed
he actually is.

550
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:21,497
[phone buzzes]

551
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,043
Great, I'm being summoned for
my meeting with the captain.

552
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,961
No, thank you. It's
good timing though.

553
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:30,214
I gotta grab my car from the station
and deal with a family thing.

554
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:31,298
Everything okay?

555
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:34,968
Oh, yeah. Never any drama
in the Gillory household.

556
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:36,053
Oh, never.

557
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:41,475
[knocks on door]

558
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:44,353
Detective Karadec, come in.

559
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,397
Don't worry, it's not yours.

560
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:48,482
I wasn't worried.

561
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:51,276
Nor should you be. I
didn't even read your file.

562
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,237
Your reputation
precedes you. Please.

563
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,335
Morgan Gillory,
tell me about her.

564
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:10,254
I thought this
meeting was about me.

565
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:12,131
It is, but she's your partner,

566
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:15,217
and I think we can both admit
that it's unconventional

567
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,970
and really not your
style, Detective.

568
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,055
So, you have read my file.

569
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:22,850
I don't need to read anything to know
that you're a badge-and-oath kind of guy.

570
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:26,603
But Morgan, she doesn't strike me
as somebody who stays in her lane.

571
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:28,230
[scoffs]

572
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,439
Well, we work well together

573
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:31,817
-if that's what you're getting at.
-You certainly do.

574
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,653
Your case rate has increased
ever since you two teamed up.

575
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:38,156
You were smart to claim
her as your partner.

576
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,785
You don't know Morgan if you
think anyone can claim her.

577
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:44,288
Mmm.

578
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:49,626
[Karadec sighs]

579
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:53,714
Was there something else
you needed, Detective?

580
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,217
No.

581
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:02,222
Hey, heard back from the guy that
runs Serenity Arms, Gavin Tillman.

582
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:04,433
-He's available to meet.
-Hmm. Let's go.

583
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,982
[♪ "Sad Sandra" playing]

584
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:22,534
[Arthur grunts]

585
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:23,869
I think you forgot something.

586
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,704
-I wanna talk first.
-About what?

587
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,706
This is very simple.
You've got the backpack.

588
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:30,000
You give me the backpack.
End of transaction.

589
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,084
[scoffs]

590
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:36,924
So, you really think that,
uh, whatever's in that bag

591
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:40,427
will give you answers and
not just more questions?

592
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:43,711
You didn't look in it, did you?

593
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:46,892
Why?

594
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:50,687
I don't know, I thought
about it, you know?

595
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,940
But I know Roman, okay?

596
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:54,942
The dude is solid,
and he wouldn't just

597
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:58,153
up and disappear from
his people for no reason.

598
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:02,491
So, I keep asking myself, what
the hell happened 15 years ago

599
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,785
that was bad enough to
make a good man run?

600
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:08,747
And to be quite honest, I'm not sure
if I wanna know the answer to that.

601
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,915
Do you?

602
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:12,084
Yes, so give us the bag.

603
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:15,504
[stutters] What are you… How
did you know where I was?

604
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,215
The family tracker app. You can
see my location, I can see yours.

605
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:20,050
-No, we're not doing this, okay?
-No, Mom, stop.

606
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,343
We didn't get the bag yet.

607
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,306
You can go, but I'm not
leaving here without it.

608
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,721
[chuckles]

609
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:27,766
No, it's…

610
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:33,063
You look just like your dad when he's
about to start digging into something.

611
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,735
-You really knew my dad?
-Oh, yeah.

612
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:42,781
You know, him and me, we went way
back. I mean, we came up together.

613
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,616
We were practically inseparable.

614
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,786
And he spent so much
time at my house,

615
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:51,081
ate so many meals, that my mom
started calling him Plates.

616
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:52,249
[chuckles]

617
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:57,379
We need your help.

618
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:03,927
I don't understand why my
dad left me, but I need to.

619
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:14,104
[inhales] All right,
look, I get it, okay?

620
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:19,693
When I heard his voice, it was like
time hadn't passed, but it had.

621
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:22,612
I mean 15 years is a
long time to disappear.

622
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:28,118
And I miss him.

623
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:31,997
My mom's like ridiculously smart,
so if there's a clue in that bag,

624
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,083
she'll find it and then
maybe we'll find him.

625
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:42,007
Please?

626
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:46,845
All right. Okay.

627
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:49,097
I'll get it to you.

628
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:51,099
Wonderful. Ready?

629
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,314
-I know you didn't want me here...
-Not another word.

630
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:58,732
-No. Do you see? I helped.
-Ava, stop it.

631
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:01,485
-He wouldn't have given it to us if I...
-We will talk about this later.

632
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:05,197
Right now, I am so angry I don't trust
anything that would come out of my mouth.

633
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:15,999
[Oz] What can you tell
us about Bobby Romano?

634
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:17,834
I've run this place 22 years,

635
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:22,089
and I can honestly say I've
never met anyone like Bobby.

636
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:23,757
-Is that a good thing?
-[Gavin] Oh, yeah.

637
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,093
See, a lot of people land here,
they're fresh out of prison.

638
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:28,595
They're mad at the world.
They want to burn it all down.

639
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:30,222
But not Bobby.

640
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:33,266
He dusted himself off and
decided to make the world better.

641
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,810
With protein powder?

642
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:39,314
[chuckles] Okay, yeah, I know it
sounds silly, but Bobby believes in it.

643
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:40,398
What's the harm?

644
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:44,236
Well, if Bobby felt so
strongly about his business,

645
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,988
how far do you think
he'd go to protect it?

646
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:49,783
What are you asking?

647
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,451
A woman's been murdered.

648
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:53,245
Um, Tori Nolan.

649
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,664
She and Bobby had a bit of a
past. Do you know that name?

650
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,750
Bobby mentioned Tori a few
times when he first got here,

651
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:01,503
said that she actually
helped put him in prison,

652
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,046
but he wasn't angry about it.

653
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,924
Like I said, Bobby left all
that behind when he got out.

654
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:08,760
But then… she threatened him.

655
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:11,364
-He told us she called him.
-[Gavin] Oh, she did more than that.

656
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,014
She showed up at his warehouse.

657
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:15,934
She said not only would
she ruin his launch,

658
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:19,062
but she'd see to it that he
went back to prison for life.

659
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:20,355
What did Tori find out?

660
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,358
Bobby wouldn't say.

661
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:26,820
But when he missed his last group
session that morning, I called him.

662
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,531
He was frantic.

663
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:33,743
He said… [huffs] …"I should have
taken care of this ten years ago."

664
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:38,123
Look, I thought he meant get a
restraining order or something.

665
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:40,917
I didn't think he'd hurt her.

666
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:48,383
-LAPD.
-Bobby, open the door.

667
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,814
How long has Bobby been dead?

668
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:04,774
ME says a few hours.

669
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:07,694
An employee told us that Bobby was
very upset after we spoke with him,

670
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:10,113
sent everyone home early and
locked himself in his office.

671
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:13,491
And we're guessing that's where he
swallowed enough pills to overdose?

672
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:14,660
-[Oz] Mm-hmm.
-What'd he take?

673
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:17,495
It's a new party drug
called Dazzle Kitty.

674
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:21,208
It's a euphoria inducing stimulant like
ecstasy, but five times more potent.

675
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:24,211
In large quantities, it
can cause cardiac arrest,

676
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:25,879
which we believe is
what happened to Bobby.

677
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,923
The L3 was a cover for
shipping the drugs.

678
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,091
We found bags of it hidden
in the powder canisters.

679
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:34,095
Now, most of these are real companies
just purchasing protein powder,

680
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:35,430
but this code, 44889,

681
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,933
corresponds to the orders that
had bags of drugs in the powder.

682
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,269
We assume they're being trafficked
to distributors around the country.

683
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:44,856
We also found a .380 pistol in his desk
that matches the gunshot wounds on Tori.

684
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,820
-We're sending to ballistics for testing.
-[Morgan] Beef and barley soup!

685
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:52,322
Beef and barley soup.

686
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:54,991
Saying it again doesn't
make it any clearer, Morgan.

687
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:58,745
Somebody wants us to think that
Bobby killed Tori and then OD'd.

688
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:00,747
-But you don't buy it.
-No, when we were here earlier,

689
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,415
Bobby couldn't wait
to show us around.

690
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:04,751
Now he's not the brightest
bulb, but even he's smart enough

691
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:07,629
to not want cops digging around
in a place where there's drugs.

692
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,798
-Plus, the soup.
-Soup?

693
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,592
I opened his mouth and
I smelled inside of it,

694
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:13,635
and it definitely smells
like beef and barley soup.

695
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,304
And he dribbled a little
bit on his T-shirt.

696
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:16,972
You can see it there.
That wasn't there before.

697
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:20,058
This guy ate the soup and died
right around the same time.

698
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:22,102
-Okay?
-There's no soup container.

699
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,729
We checked all the
trash cans, nothing.

700
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:25,730
We also checked the sink drain.

701
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:31,903
-Is that…
-A carrot?

702
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:34,823
Mm-hmm. And a half-melted
capsule of Dazzle Kitty.

703
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:39,035
So, either Bobby drugged
his own soup, ate it,

704
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,871
and then high as a kite,
dumped the rest down the drain,

705
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:44,916
magicked the container
away before passing out…

706
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:48,378
-Or…
-Or someone else put the drug in the soup.

707
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:49,963
And that someone
wants us to think

708
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:52,632
that the drug operation and Tori's
murder were all Bobby's doing.

709
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:54,676
And now that he's dead,
it's a closed case.

710
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,053
Yes. I think whoever killed
Bobby also killed Tori

711
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:58,457
and masterminded
the whole thing.

712
00:34:58,930 --> 00:34:59,973
Then who's the brains?

713
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:16,156
[siren wailing]

714
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,828
-[officer 1] Freeze!
-[officer 2] Hands up!

715
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:24,414
Gavin Tillman, get out of the
vehicle with your hands up.

716
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,511
[indistinct chatter
on walkie-talkie]

717
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:40,805
I hope you're curious how
we found out about this,

718
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:42,682
'cause I've been pretty
excited to tell you.

719
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:44,476
At first, we thought, "Oh,
for sure, it's Lamar."

720
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,895
Yeah, we brought him in for questioning,
but he wouldn't give anything up.

721
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,022
He's loyal, isn't he?
I'll give him that.

722
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,149
But Bobby didn't get
the same courtesy.

723
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:53,943
Lamar was very quick to tell
us that he met Bobby in prison,

724
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:57,447
and Bobby brought him into
his L3 drug operation.

725
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:00,909
See, the problem there is that
neither of those things are true.

726
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,786
A, Bobby had no idea there
was a drug operation,

727
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,746
and B, they weren't in
prison at the same time.

728
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:05,997
They sure weren't.

729
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:10,377
After they got out, they spent time
at your halfway house, Serenity Arms.

730
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,630
Once we made that connection,
Lamar was much more cooperative.

731
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,215
[Morgan] Oh, yeah,
he gave you right up.

732
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,926
Yeah, but Lamar insisted he had nothing
to do with Tori and Bobby's deaths,

733
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,261
and he had the
alibis to prove it.

734
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:22,806
He sure did. No, that was all you. But
you were honest with Karadec and Oz.

735
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:26,143
Bobby did tell you about
Tori in his sessions,

736
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:28,520
and Bobby did talk to
you about Tori's threats.

737
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:31,481
[Karadec] Bobby had no idea what
Tori was talking about, but you did.

738
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:34,192
Tori reaching out to
Bobby blew her cover.

739
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,444
You knew exactly
where to find her.

740
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:37,612
[Morgan] So, you
waited at Cloud House,

741
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:39,573
and when Tori's car came
into view, you shot her.

742
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:40,782
[screams]

743
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,492
You couldn't have predicted
the state she'd be in,

744
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,244
but you just used it
to your advantage.

745
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:45,954
At that point, Bobby
was a liability.

746
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,677
Lamar said he called you right
after we showed up to the warehouse.

747
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:51,418
You needed to tie up loose ends.

748
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:55,225
When we talked to you at the halfway
house, Bobby was already dead.

749
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:58,466
-I want a lawyer.
-Oh, I bet you do.

750
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,926
Maybe more than one.

751
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:01,594
Go deep on that bench.

752
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,017
[Karadec] Spoke to the
editor of Takedown Magazine.

753
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:10,019
They're gonna finish Tori's last
article and put out a tribute issue.

754
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:11,479
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

755
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:14,357
Aw, I like that. The world
needs more Toris in it.

756
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:15,859
Yeah.

757
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:18,236
I'm gonna get out of here
before the captain ambushes me.

758
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:20,447
You know, you can't
avoid him forever.

759
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:21,823
Um. I have owed

760
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:25,785
the Culver City Public
Library $3.50 since the '90s,

761
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:28,371
so, I'm gonna beg to differ.

762
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:31,875
Mmm. You know there's always some growing
pains when a new person joins a team.

763
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:33,543
There is?

764
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:37,672
I remember nothing but absolute
delight when I came on board.

765
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:39,507
Oh.

766
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:41,384
See ya.

767
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:54,481
-[car door slams]
-Hey, you need some help?

768
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:55,565
No, I'm good.

769
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:58,860
She just needs some
coolant or she gets cranky.

770
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,696
-Not cranky, assertive.
-[chuckles]

771
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,740
I thought you were gonna
come by for a chat today.

772
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:07,076
Nah, I made that up to buy some
time so I could get out of it.

773
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,953
Plus, I was busy, you
know, doing my job.

774
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:10,663
Yeah, you like working here.

775
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:15,710
-Is that a question?
-No, that's a surprised observation.

776
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:17,462
-Why surprised?
-I just heard some rumors

777
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:21,257
you don't respond
positively to authority.

778
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:26,596
I don't respond positively to
authority that abuses their power.

779
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:27,889
Is that how you see me?

780
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,474
I don't know.

781
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:32,477
I haven't decided on that yet.

782
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,230
Well, what have you decided on?

783
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,148
[inhales] Um…

784
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:40,360
I've decided I'd like you to
get your car out of my way

785
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:41,778
so I can go home to my kids.

786
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,571
All right, Gillory.

787
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,032
Let me have it.

788
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:52,997
All right… [clears
throat] …Let's see.

789
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:55,792
You're from a legacy
family, right?

790
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:58,378
So, that tells me you
could take the easy road,

791
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:01,548
but you choose not to because you want
to prove to everybody that you can.

792
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:04,884
And that's admirable, but
it also makes you smug.

793
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:09,764
You like being captain. You like
the respect, like the authority.

794
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:10,890
Love the boots.

795
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:12,475
But you also miss
being in the field

796
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:14,102
a little bit more than
you thought you would.

797
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:17,105
You like to be in the action, right?
'Cause that makes you feel important.

798
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:18,898
Anything else?

799
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:21,317
Mm-hmm.

800
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:26,030
You like to keep people guessing
if your interest in them is real

801
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:28,283
or just a way to get
something you want.

802
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,368
Pretty good.

803
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:33,705
You got two out of the three.

804
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,832
Oh, yeah? Which one
did I get wrong?

805
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:43,464
I'm not as good at
this game as you are.

806
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:48,970
But I've learned
one thing for sure.

807
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:52,098
You give Morgan
Gillory a puzzle,

808
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,851
she won't stop thinking
about it until it's solved.

809
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:03,318
Good night, Morgan.

810
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:09,616
[car door slams]

811
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:19,626
Hey.

812
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:22,211
Hey.

813
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:25,965
You're still mad.

814
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:31,012
[sighs] Yeah, I am.

815
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,599
I love you more than
anything in this world,

816
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:37,852
so I'm gonna do whatever I
need to do to keep you safe.

817
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:40,647
If I say no to you, I
expect you to listen.

818
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:42,941
-But nothing bad happened.
-That's not the point.

819
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:46,194
I told you no, and you went off and
did whatever you wanted to do anyway.

820
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,696
-Sounds familiar.
-Excuse me?

821
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,449
If you don't agree with someone,
you never listen to them.

822
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:53,993
-What would you have done if you were me?
-[grunts]

823
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:55,828
-Yeah, exactly.
-Ava.

824
00:40:57,497 --> 00:41:01,542
You're not wrong, okay? The
difference is I am an adult.

825
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:05,296
-I get to make those choices. You don't.
-You're such a hypocrite.

826
