That's so sweet. Well, come
on. Let's get you seated.

Oh. Wow. Some people
can be so rude.

10
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,665
No worries. Best
seat in the house.

I'll let you look that over
while I get all that cleaned up.

Uh, excuse me.

13
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:48,090

00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,551

Guys, come on, let's go.

Ludo's gonna be here any
second. Breakfast is ready.

19
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:23,125
I see you've inherited
my judgmental stare.

20
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,919
I thought only Ava got that, who
happens to love toaster waffles,

21
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:27,129
I'll have you know.

22
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,547
Ooh, toaster waffles.

23
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,049
One of 'em does. I
can't keep track.

24
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:31,883
-Hot, hot, hot.
-Here.

25
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,469
What are these?

26
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:36,054
Just a little project
I'm working on

27
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:38,098
now that we have some
walking-around money.

28
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:40,267
I thought I'd hire a
little part-time help.

29
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,019
-I recommend this one.
-Oh, yeah?

30
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:45,439
She plays laser tag. Heightened
peripheral vision, fast reflexes.

31
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,899
Important traits as
Chloe starts walking.

32
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:48,651
I feel like you picked
her 'cause she's pretty,

33
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:50,652
but you're doing a
good job of hiding it.

34
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:53,071
Oh, I know her. She was a
senior when I was a freshman.

35
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:54,907
-Yeah? What do you know about her?
-I don't know.

36
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,450
Seniors don't talk to freshmen.

37
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,410
Well, maybe dig around in her
social media or something.

38
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:00,454
I'm thinking about hiring
somebody part-time.

39
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:03,498
Oh, right. Back to
work full-time today.

40
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:05,792
That's right. And while I'm
at work, I wanna make sure

41
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:08,337
that you guys are getting
the support you need at home.

42
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,506
Ludo needed some backup, I got him
that. So, tell me what you guys need.

43
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,635
-I'd still love to visit the morgue.
-I love that idea, you know.

44
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:16,845
Why don't you show me you
can change Chloe's diaper

45
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:20,015
without passing out from the smell,
and we'll graduate to formaldehyde?

46
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,642
What about you, Ava?

47
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:24,019
I'd love to hear some
news about my dad.

48
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,483
I mean, it's okay.

49
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:32,194
I know you haven't really had the
chance to talk to Lieutenant Soto,

50
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:35,197
but now that you're back,
maybe she has some news.

51
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,283
I'm definitely
gonna look into it.

52
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:43,413
But right now I'm needed at a
crime scene. You take over, okay?

53
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,583
See if you can keep these guys
alive till Ludo gets here?

54
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:46,792
-I love you. Goodbye.
-Love you.

55
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,503
-Pay me what you're gonna pay her.
-Oh, absolutely.

56
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:52,172
You send that invoice to
accounts payable, okay?

57
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:54,466
-Bye.
-Bye.

58
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,929
I think what she means
by accounts payable is...

59
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,389
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it.

60
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,650
Victim's name is
Nathan Gould, 46.

61
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,694
Address on his license puts
him right in the neighborhood.

62
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:17,614
Café hostess found him behind these
dumpsters with a bag taped over his head.

63
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:18,991
Money and credit
cards are still here.

64
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:21,034
Yeah. Phone too. Doesn't
seem like a robbery.

65
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:22,577
Maybe something more personal?

66
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:23,829
Is he gonna make it?

67
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:27,541
He was in cardiac arrest when we
got here. No pulse, no respiration.

68
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,252
Got a heartbeat back, but he
hasn't regained consciousness.

69
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,337
Ventilator's doing
the breathing for him.

70
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:33,964
So he could be brain dead.

71
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,591
They'll be able to tell
more at the hospital.

72
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:38,427
We just don't know how long he was
without oxygen before we landed.

73
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,179
Poor guy's luck might
have finally run out.

74
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:41,388
Finally? You know this guy?

75
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,516
Nathan was a frequent flyer.
Rode with us more than once.

76
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,518
History of suspicious injuries.

77
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:49,688
-Suspicious how?
-He told us he fell and broke his leg.

78
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,857
Before that it was burned
his hand on the stove.

79
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,984
Always just said he was clumsy.

80
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,027
But you think
someone else helped?

81
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:57,863
Nathan was a good guy.

82
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,823
I hope you find who did this.

83
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:03,118
You said a hostess found him?

84
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:06,246
Yeah, she's a little shaken, but I
think she can answer some questions.

85
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,461
He was so nervous.

86
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:14,629
Said he was meeting
someone special.

87
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,048
That poor man.

88
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:18,508
This where he sat?

89
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:21,553
I went inside to get
some cleaning supplies,

90
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,597
and when I came out,
I thought he'd left.

91
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,892
I found that pin, and I ran
up the street to look for him.

92
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:29,936
Then things got busy, and I
just forgot about cleaning up.

93
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,688
I'm glad you did.

94
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,148
Karadec, check this out.

95
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,068
You ever spill a drink on
yourself at one of these tables?

96
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:39,237
Uh, can't say I
recall doing that, no.

97
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:41,156
Of course you haven't. You
like to put on a Hazmat suit

98
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,324
when you eat something crumbly.

99
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,742
But just pretend for one second

100
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:46,787
that you're a normal guy
having a normal meal, okay?

101
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,251
There you are, sipping on a
refreshing drink on a hot summer day

102
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:55,462
when, uh-oh, you spill
it all over the table.

103
00:04:56,379 --> 00:05:01,134
It drips through the cracks and lands
all over your unprotected pants.

104
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:04,137
No!

105
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,766
Mm-hmm. I know.

106
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,810
But look at these spills.
They all landed evenly.

107
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:12,062
All over the ground, the chairs.

108
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,231
There weren't even
butts in the seats.

109
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,775
The spills were staged.

110
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,318
Someone knew Nathan
was going to be here

111
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,320
and wanted to make sure
he'd sit by the alley.

112
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:23,574
What time would you say you seated him?
And when did you find him in the alley?

113
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,867
I guess he got here
around a quarter to eight.

114
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:27,744
Okay, so how'd
you find the body?

115
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,038
-I heard ducks.
-Ducks?

116
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,165
Ducks quacking
somewhere in the alley.

117
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,751
I went to look, and…

118
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,921
And I found him.

119
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:39,840
I think that's all
we have for now.

120
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:42,176
If there's any other questions,
we'll be sure to let you know.

121
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:43,552
Okay.

122
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:49,724
What?

123
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,935
I thought you were gonna launch
into a comprehensive breakdown

124
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,271
of the migratory patterns of
ducks in the Los Angeles area.

125
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,939
-Is that what you thought? Hmm.
-Yeah.

126
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:59,342
Well, I could, but that would be pointless
'cause there were no ducks in that alley.

127
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:02,112
Did you see signs of
ducks? There was no poop.

128
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,405
That's all ducks do. They poop.

129
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,449
I don't know what she heard,
but I don't think it was ducks.

130
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,450
All right, we put
a pin in the ducks.

131
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,703
Vic's apartment's just
a few blocks from here.

132
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,039
If the paramedics were convinced
someone was repeatedly hurting him,

133
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:13,331
let's go find out who.

134
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:24,259
Well, books on player stats,
half a dozen team schedules.

135
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,219
Nathan Gould really
loved his sports.

136
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:29,472
-Oh, yeah? Who's his team?
-Enlighten me.

137
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:32,142
Me? I can't even figure out
what his favorite sport is.

138
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,310
I've been all over this place.

139
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,980
There's not a baseball cap or a
jersey, not a banner on the wall.

140
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,481
This place is wild though.

141
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:41,276
If anybody this obsessed with
stats was actually into sports,

142
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,528
do you know what it
would look like in here?

143
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:50,702
It'd look like the inside
of a stadium gift shop.

144
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,955
But I did also notice
this very impressive stack

145
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:57,375
of overdue bills, a sport
I'm very familiar with.

146
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:58,961
Looks like Nathan was
a couple of weeks away

147
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:00,503
from having
everything turned off.

148
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:03,173
So you don't think Nathan loved
sports, you think he loved gambling.

149
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,676
And I don't think gambling loved
him back, which could explain

150
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,095
all those mysterious injuries that
the paramedics were talking about.

151
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:13,224
Nathan had fallen behind on his debts,
and to the kind of people who do worse

152
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,268
than turn off the water
when the payment's late.

153
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:17,937
Hmm.

154
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,232
What do you think it is?

155
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:27,072
Don't know. It could be a bank account,
or passcode, international phone number.

156
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,395
Hmm.

157
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:34,162
Okay, those scary guys you
were just talking about,

158
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,706
the debt collectors,
they know home addresses?

159
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,791
Shh.

160
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,841
We're nice people. You
could have just knocked.

161
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,385
Ah!

162
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,888

On your stomach.
On your stomach.

183
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,949
Hands behind your back.

184
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:05,712
Uh-huh.

185
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,839
"Marco Deleon."

186
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:11,218
Buddy ditched you pretty quick there,
Marco. That hurt your feelings?

187
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:14,137
-He's not my buddy.
-Well, no, not after a stunt like that.

188
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,348
I think what Marco means is
they're just business associates,

189
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:17,891
isn't that right, Marco? Oh.

190
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,560
Lookee here. I found something.

191
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,228
So this is what we're
thinking, Marco.

192
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:25,232
You and your business associate work
for whoever Nathan Gould owed money to.

193
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,275
And you or someone else
who works for your boss

194
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,611
slipped a plastic bag over
Nathan's head this morning.

195
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:32,322
He's still alive, by the way.
Probably not gonna make it though.

196
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,825
Anyway, knowing that Nathan's never
going to make good on his debts,

197
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,786
your boss sent you over here to recoup
what you could in stolen valuables.

198
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:38,870
Sound about right?

199
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:42,457
Does he have anything else in his pocket,
a weapon, a vial of something to inject?

200
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,086
No. Why? What are you thinking?

201
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,713
Thinking we may have misjudged
our friend Marco here.

202
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,173
And if I'm right about that,

203
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,842
you are really gonna wanna
introduce us to your boss.

204
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,880
Hey. We got a…

205
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:35,135
Hey, Ray, we're here to ask some
questions about Nathan Gould.

206
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:36,636
I don't talk to cops.

207
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:38,721
Works for me. I'm not a cop.

208
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,365
And I wouldn't hate it if
this one didn't talk at all.

209
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:44,853
Oh, my goodness. Is that
the WhisperShoe Ultra?

210
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:48,982
Ugh. Electric card
shuffler. Those are so cool.

211
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,651
Does every table in
here have one of those?

212
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,946
Sure does. Oh, man, I
wish my kid was here.

213
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:58,032
He's going through a real
card phase right now.

214
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:00,743
Just the other day, he made me sit
through an entire YouTube video

215
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,912
on the ins and outs of
how this machine works.

216
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,123
Ain't that so random?

217
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:07,917
Everybody out.

218
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:10,837
Now!

219
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,760
Um…

220
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:18,970
What just happened?

221
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:22,724
It turns out these card shuffling machines
aren't as random as people think they are.

222
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,142
Right, Ray?

223
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:34,194
And that one in particular, the
WhisperShoe Ultra, is really not random.

224
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,620
In ways a disreputable house
could use to stack the odds.

225
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:47,165
Definitely not something
Ray wants getting out there.

226
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,792
You got stones.
I'll give you that.

227
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,670
Coming in here,
lobbing accusations.

228
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,756
Actually, Ray, I
think you heard wrong.

229
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,425
Thanks to my colleague here,
we're pretty certain that

230
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,677
you weren't involved in
the attack on Mr. Gould.

231
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,387
At least not the
one this morning.

232
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:04,140
Yes, see, when we found
that empty syringe on Marco,

233
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:07,977
we realized he was going to inject an
air bubble into Nathan's bloodstream.

234
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:11,064
So if Marco went there
to kill Nathan then,

235
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:14,567
that means you and your guys
didn't attack Nathan earlier.

236
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:15,944
Ain't that ironic? Hmm?

237
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:20,156
Sending a guy to commit a murder proves
that you didn't commit that murder.

238
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:22,909
Send that one to Alanis, right?

239
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,328
But that makes me wonder.

240
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,749
Why did you send Marco
with just an empty syringe?

241
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,794
I mean, injecting an air bubble
into someone's bloodstream,

242
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:35,755
that would make their death
look like natural causes, right?

243
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:39,342
But someone like you, in
the reputation business,

244
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,511
would want Nathan's
death to send a message.

245
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:47,016
Unless you had a way to
profit off of Nathan's death,

246
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,812
but only if it looked
like you didn't kill him.

247
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:54,524
185004606. Does that
number sound familiar?

248
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:59,404
It does. It did sound
familiar. Do you see that?

249
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:02,407
That number we saw at Nathan's, that
was Ray's Social Security number.

250
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,828
You see, before the
current randomized system,

251
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,163
Social Security numbers were
issued based on the state

252
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:12,583
where the applicant lived, and
when the application came in.

253
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,006
Now, I can roughly guess
your age, you know,

254
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:20,883
even with the ten or so years
that hard living put on you.

255
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:24,262
And thanks to that photo over there
of you marching in the Mummers parade,

256
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:27,724
which is an annual Philly thing, I'm
guessing you're from Pennsylvania.

257
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,226
Both of those make sense with
the number that we found.

258
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,270
But that begs the question.

259
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:36,357
Why would Nathan Gould have his
loan shark's Social Security number?

260
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:39,736
But you hate talking to cops,
so I'll answer this one for you.

261
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:43,114
You need someone's Social Security
number, and in many cases a notary,

262
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,949
which would explain
the ink smudge,

263
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:48,494
to make them the beneficiary
of your life insurance.

264
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:53,166
So, in other words, Ray, you forced
Nathan Gould to make you the beneficiary

265
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:56,335
on his insurance policy as
a way to pay off his loans.

266
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:57,921
And then because you
love to stack the deck,

267
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,006
you sent Marco to
make sure you collect.

268
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:03,092
I didn't force Nathan to do
anything. It was his idea.

269
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,636
Really? Care to elaborate?

270
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,766
I'm not getting the
sense that he does.

271
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,477
Mmm. Well, we wanna know who else
is mad enough to kill Nathan,

272
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,021
we need to find out whose name
he took off the life insurance.

273
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:16,856
See you, Ray.

274
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:27,784
Jessica, this is the old beneficiary form
from your father's life insurance policy.

275
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,660
We had the insurance
company pull it for us.

276
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:33,289
Until a few weeks ago, you were in line
to collect $100,000 when your dad died.

277
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,958
It made us wonder how you felt
about it when he changed the form.

278
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:39,921
This is the first I'm hearing my dad
even had a life insurance policy,

279
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,506
much less that my
name was on it.

280
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,674
Honestly, I'm surprised.

281
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,468
He wasn't exactly
good with money.

282
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,553
Sounds like you
two weren't close.

283
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:50,139
He and my mom split
when I was eight…

284
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:53,142
…over his gambling
habits, mostly. I think.

285
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:56,229
-Where's your mom now?
-Denver with my stepdad.

286
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:59,690
I came back out here…
…after school for work.

287
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:04,237
I tried to keep in touch
with my dad over the years,

288
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,655
but he never followed through.

289
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:09,283
Till a couple of months ago he
reached out, out of the blue.

290
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:13,538
He said he was going away soon, and he
wanted to make things right before he did.

291
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:18,417
We've seen each other more in the last
couple of months than we have in decades.

292
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:24,048
Jessica, when your dad was attacked, he
was carrying a pin on him in a gift box.

293
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:26,425
It was a ladybug. Does
that mean anything to you?

294
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,096
Oh. Um…

295
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:35,768
Ladybug was his nickname
for me as a kid.

296
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,567
Because he said I was
cute and good luck.

297
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:46,863
Here you go.

298
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,782
Well, then, if the
gift was for you,

299
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,910
you're the person your dad was
expecting to meet this morning.

300
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:53,953
Can I ask why you didn't show?

301
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,664
I did show, he didn't.

302
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:01,586
So you were at Dudley Market in
Venice around 7:45 this morning?

303
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:04,630
No, I was waiting for him at
Ground Wire in Toluca Lake.

304
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:06,234
That's where we were
supposed to meet.

305
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,305
Thanks, Jessica.

306
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,890
We'll reach out
when we know more.

307
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:18,227
-Nathan Gould's daughter?
-Yep, Jessica.

308
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,396
We're checking her alibi,
but we don't like her for it.

309
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,731
What you got there?

310
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:25,067
I just noticed the hotel across the
street from the café had security cameras.

311
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,737
So Lieutenant wanted me to check and
see if it caught the attack, but…

312
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,030
…nothing.

313
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,239
Anything interesting?

314
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:33,659
Well, Nathan and his daughter were
estranged for most of her life.

315
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:37,246
He'd reached out recently and reconciled.
They were supposed to meet this morning,

316
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,790
but for some reason they ended
up at two different cafés.

317
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:41,167
We're still figuring that out.

318
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,712
One thing she mentioned, he told her
he was planning to go away for a while.

319
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:47,256
So did he book any airline
tickets or hotel rooms

320
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,800
that would let us know
where he was going?

321
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:51,052
I've been going through his
credit card and bank statements.

322
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,815
I haven't seen anything
about travel plans.

323
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,934
Well, this is weird.

324
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,771
He had a subscription for a specialty dog
food that he canceled a few weeks ago.

325
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,148
We were just at his place. Did
you see any signs of a dog?

326
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:05,566
I did not.

327
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,111
I mean, I guess it's possible
the dog could have died,

328
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:11,072
but what if he gave it away?
That would make a lot more sense.

329
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,531
Go on.

330
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:14,825
Well, Nathan recently
reconciled with his daughter,

331
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:17,370
who he hasn't had any
contact with for years.

332
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:21,123
He settles his debts with a loan shark by
signing over his life insurance, right?

333
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,668
And then he tells his
daughter he's going away,

334
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,753
despite there being
no evidence of travel.

335
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:28,256
Put that together with
giving your dog away,

336
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,883
and I think this man was
planning on taking his own life.

337
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:33,094
That's what he meant by
going away for a while.

338
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:37,223
So somebody decides to kill the guy
right when he's about to kill himself.

339
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,724
But why?

340
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,237
-They didn't have any stevia.
-That's fine.

341
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,406
-Or oat milk.
-Less fine.

342
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,408
And I didn't think you'd
want their decaf. So…

343
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,787
So you went with hot water.

344
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:01,706
What a treat.

345
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,585
This is the hospital's
transplant coordinator.

346
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:07,169
They're discussing
organ donations.

347
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,506
-So he's officially brain dead?
-Yeah.

348
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:15,511
Some timing, huh?

349
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:18,973
This poor woman finally
reconciles with her father.

350
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,019
You okay?

351
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,647
You just, I don't know,
seem a little quiet for you.

352
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,900
Ava asked if there was
any news about her dad.

353
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:31,819
You haven't told her
about Arthur yet, huh?

354
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:33,613
-No.
-Hmm.

355
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:36,657
Well, even I've heard her say she
wants you to treat her like a grown-up.

356
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:38,117
Maybe take her at her word.

357
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:49,879
You think he was going
to take his own life?

358
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,131
You didn't know?

359
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:54,675
Oh.

360
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:58,346
Emmett. His dog.

361
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:01,515
Dad asked me to take care
of him while he traveled.

362
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:04,310
But why did he wanna die?

363
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:07,980
It's just a theory right now, but we think
he actually may have been protecting you.

364
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:11,192
Your dad owed money to some loan sharks.
They would have kept hurting him.

365
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,943
Eventually, probably
a lot worse.

366
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:14,737
Knowing how these people
operate, we think that

367
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,322
maybe they threatened
to come after you next.

368
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:20,284
So by changing his life insurance
policy, and offering to end his own life,

369
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:22,579
we think he was making sure you
didn't end up paying for his sins.

370
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:25,831
Yeah. Was your dad close with anyone
he would have talked to about this?

371
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,836
I… We had barely gotten
to know each other again.

372
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,965
I just… I don't know enough
about his life to say.

373
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:36,967
Did your dad know
you were pregnant?

374
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,471
How did you know?

375
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,390
Well, the smells in here
are driving you nuts.

376
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:45,768
I see that saltine peeking out of
your purse, and you've got ginger tea.

377
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,061
Been there a few times.

378
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:50,064
Congratulations.

379
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,525
Uh…

380
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,444
I told him the last
time we saw each other.

381
00:19:55,945 --> 00:20:00,199
And… …he was so excited.

382
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:03,661
We joked about how much fun it is
to have a ton of doctor visits.

383
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,831
It was the one thing
we bonded over.

384
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,290
He told you about his injuries?

385
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,668
Um, his injuries? No, no.

386
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:13,504
Uh, the visits that he talked
about were to a cardiologist.

387
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:16,882
He said he recently had a whole
series of scans and tests.

388
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:18,593
Did he mention any
specific symptoms?

389
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:21,512
No. If anything, it
was the opposite.

390
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:25,808
He went out of his way to make sure
I knew that everything was fine.

391
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,652
Why would someone who's fine put
themselves through a series of tests?

392
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:39,530
Oh, we're like 20 minutes
early. I didn't even realize.

393
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:42,324
I know. I'm so impressed. I'm
not sure how we pulled that off.

394
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:43,493
I like this look on us.

395
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:46,136
I can get some alone time in the
hydroponics lab before homeroom.

396
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,332
-Bye, love you.
-Bye, have a good day.

397
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:51,000
The joys of being a dweeb.

398
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,461
I'm not sure what I'm supposed
to do, but I'll manage.

399
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,255
Ava.

400
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:58,361
Why don't you hang
back for a second?

401
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:01,969
I need to talk to
you about something.

402
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:07,892
So, at least as of a few weeks
ago, my dad was living in Nevada?

403
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:09,977
According to this Arthur guy.

404
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:13,397
Did he say how long he
was living there for?

405
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:14,690
No.

406
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:19,695
And all we know about Arthur
is that he's a landscaper?

407
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:20,946
I guess so.

408
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:24,492
I know it's not a lot of information
and we're gonna keep digging around.

409
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:26,160
I didn't want to
fill you in too early

410
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:29,121
'cause I didn't want you to get
your hopes up or be let down.

411
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,749
No, I-I want you to
tell me everything.

412
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:35,419
I know you do. I heard you, so that's
why I was filling you in on this.

413
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:41,133
Ooh. I gotta go to work.

414
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,136
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

415
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,597
Are you sure? 'Cause if not, I'll
just tell him I'm not coming in today.

416
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,516
-No, no, no. Mom, it's okay.
-You're gonna play hooky...

417
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:49,683
I'm fine.

418
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,895
-Okay. I love you.
-I love you.

419
00:21:58,192 --> 00:21:59,872
Can you find your way
to school from here?

420
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,655
Yeah, Mom, I'll
plug it into Waze.

421
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:24,301
Hey. Daphne, you got
Nathan Gould's phone?

422
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:26,178
Yeah, TID unlocked it.

423
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:28,222
Nathan got an email the
night before the attack,

424
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,724
claiming to be from
his daughter Jessica,

425
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:32,268
changing their meeting to
7:45 at the café in Venice.

426
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,978
Let me guess, this is not
Jessica's email address.

427
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,396
I checked, it's a fake.

428
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:37,023
Yeah, that would explain
why Nathan and Jessica

429
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:38,483
ended up sitting
at different cafés.

430
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:41,110
Whoever did this wanted Nathan
at that café, and alone.

431
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,362
Since Nathan and Jessica
had just reconciled,

432
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:46,448
he might not have even noticed the
email came from an unknown address.

433
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,121
Uh, Morgan, what are you doing?

434
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:55,165
There's an alarm set on
Nathan's phone for 8:01 a.m.

435
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:57,585
and the ringtone is
set to the duck sound.

436
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,794
That's what the café hostess
heard in the alleyway.

437
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:05,050
The killer wanted somebody to find his
body around 8 o'clock in the morning.

438
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:09,263
Long enough after the attack
to make sure he was brain-dead,

439
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:11,682
but soon enough to make sure
his organs were still viable.

440
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:15,978
I think Nathan Gould was
killed for his heart.

441
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,324
Robbed again, call the cops.

442
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,744
Good timing. Cops are here.

443
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,580
Sorry, I-I didn't see you.

444
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,540
You were saying something
about being robbed?

445
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:38,167
He's kidding about
calling the cops.

446
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,878
People steal things off the
bus when we're on calls,

447
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:43,380
even more so lately with all
the drug supply shortages.

448
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:46,216
We just write it up, but it's
not the controlled stuff.

449
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,760
That's locked up.

450
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:51,805
-It's not the controlled stuff, right?
-Albuterol. An asthma med.

451
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:53,265
We got more back at the house.

452
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:54,851
Is there something
we can help you with?

453
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:57,353
We had some questions about
the Nathan Gould call.

454
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,230
We're hoping you can walk
us through the timeline.

455
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:01,023
Sure, shoot.

456
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:04,485
Well, the 911 call came in around
8:01, 8:02. Is that about right?

457
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:07,196
Yeah, sounds right. Just after our
shift started, which was at 8:00.

458
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,531
And how long after that
for you to arrive on scene?

459
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:11,742
About five minutes.
Café's close.

460
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:15,496
And maybe another three minutes
after that to get a heartbeat back.

461
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,873
One last question. It's a doozy.

462
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,626
How long would a
victim have to be down

463
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,920
in order to guarantee
they'd be brain dead?

464
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:28,342
Eleven minutes, give or take.

465
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:31,971
Appreciate it.

466
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,987
You were right.

467
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:49,905
Course I was right.

468
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:52,741
Also, you should think about stocking
up on Albuterol if you need it.

469
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,660
They're having a theft
problem apparently.

470
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,453
Think I'm all good
there, but thank you.

471
00:24:56,954 --> 00:24:57,955
Where's Soto?

472
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:00,398
She stayed back at the hospital
to ask a few more questions.

473
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:04,211
This attack was timed to turn Nathan
Gould into the perfect organ donor.

474
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:06,672
He was down for at least 11
minutes before help arrived.

475
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,924
I've been thinking about
it. I think there's more.

476
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:10,384
Nathan was in on it.

477
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:13,178
The cardiac work-up. He was making
sure his heart was in good shape.

478
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:15,431
Right. We already knew that he
was planning on killing himself.

479
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,642
Nathan had arranged with
someone to give them his heart.

480
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:19,602
But then he found out he was
gonna become a grandfather,

481
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:21,979
and he changed his mind, so
the killer had to kill him.

482
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,397
Unbelievable.

483
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:26,859
Everything okay?

484
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,402
Yeah.

485
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,571
You're not gonna blast the
old-timey car horn, are you?

486
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,406
More than one novelty
ringtone per case?

487
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:34,324
I don't think so. That
would be overkill.

488
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:37,327
Fair enough, because it seems
to be, our next question is,

489
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:41,248
"Who is Nathan Gould's heart going to?"
We find them, I think we find our killer.

490
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:48,797
'Scuse me. Hi, I
work with the police.

491
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:51,008
I saw you talking to
Jessica Gould yesterday

492
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:52,676
about her father's
organ donations.

493
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,636
-Yes, I remember you.
-Yeah.

494
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,014
Has it been decided where
Nathan's heart's going yet?

495
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,268
I'm, uh, sorry, I wouldn't know.

496
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:04,021
Aren't you the hospital's
transplant coordinator?

497
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,356
And you're on the
committee, right?

498
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:06,941
Yeah, they call you guys
"The God Committee."

499
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:09,568
You literally get to decide
who lives and who dies.

500
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:12,196
If you can't answer our
questions, then who can?

501
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,781
I…

502
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:16,033
I meant I don't know
off the top of my head.

503
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:19,453
Make an appointment with my office,
and I'll look it up for you.

504
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,163
Okay?

505
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,541
Any luck?

506
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:27,795
I didn't realize the question about
where a donor heart was going was scary,

507
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:29,255
but that woman seemed
afraid to answer.

508
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:30,589
Same deal with the
transplant surgeon.

509
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,425
I get the feeling these guys
are circling the wagons.

510
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:34,676
As if someone with a lot of
pull is keeping them quiet.

511
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,761
Mmm.

512
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,971
Because maybe they want
the heart for themselves.

513
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:40,307
One thing I did find out, Jessica
Gould has given her consent,

514
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,518
so Nathan's set to be taken
off life support tomorrow.

515
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,770
-Organs will be harvested then.
-Meaning if we're right,

516
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:47,314
and someone is forcing the
hospital to give them the heart...

517
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:49,775
It'd be good to
find out who first.

518
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:50,984
Hello.

519
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:53,695
W-What? Where is she?

520
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:56,240
I'll be right there.

521
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,700
Ava just got arrested.

522
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,626
U-Uh…

523
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:11,839
What the hell happened?

524
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:13,257
Are you okay?

525
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,633
You can uncuff her now, please.

526
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:17,928
Can't do that. Building owner
caught her vandalizing his property.

527
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:22,516
-Ava, it's one of your dad's murals.
-Yeah, I'm aware.

528
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:27,354
-Oh, honey, I am so sorry.
-Just leave me alone, okay?

529
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:31,775
Okay. So what happens now?

530
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:32,985
We take her in.

531
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,779
No, listen, that's not
necessary, all right?

532
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:38,115
Her dad painted that.
This is a family matter.

533
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:39,283
I will take care of it.

534
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:42,077
Tell that to the owner.
Guy wants to press charges.

535
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,538
That's the owner? How about this?
I go smooth it over with him,

536
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:46,248
we assure him the young
lady's gonna come back,

537
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,625
clean this mess up later,
and forget it ever happened.

538
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:50,795
-No paperwork for you.
-Sorry, Detective.

539
00:27:50,878 --> 00:27:52,629
If the girl really
wanted to clean this up,

540
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:54,173
she had her chance
before you got here.

541
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:55,424
Come on, on your feet.

542
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,885
-No, don't touch my daughter, okay?
-Morgan, it's all right.

543
00:27:57,968 --> 00:27:59,553
I know it's all
right! I'm all right!

544
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,513
-Ma'am!
-And don't call me ma'am. Okay, sir?

545
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:03,557
Don't call me ma'am right now.
I don't need that from you.

546
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,350
What I need from
you is to understand

547
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:07,895
that giving a 15-year-old
girl a criminal record

548
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:10,272
over some paint is
completely insane.

549
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,774
Can we all agree on
that? I mean, it's paint!

550
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:26,121
-Ava...
-Can we not here?

551
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,500
'Cause of her?

552
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:33,545
Ava, that woman has her
own problems to deal with.

553
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:36,882
No offense.

554
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:38,967
Yeah.

555
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:41,470
-Thanks, Gina.
-You got it.

556
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,601
"Treat her like a
grown-up," he said.

557
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:50,771
You're welcome?

558
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,167
Hi.

559
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:16,129
I'm sorry.

560
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,925
Oh, buddy, come here.

561
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:21,718
I'm sorry.

562
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:23,929
I messed up.

563
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:28,266
Sometimes I forget that there's a right
time to drop huge information on someone

564
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:31,645
and a wrong time, which would be right
before you send her off to school.

565
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:35,983
It wasn't that.

566
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:40,946
I know I said I wanted to know
everything, but I was wrong.

567
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:43,281
This is way worse
than not knowing.

568
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:44,533
What do you mean?

569
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:50,122
My dad's been alive this whole time
living his life one state over.

570
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:53,333
And with everything
you've been finding out,

571
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:59,339
I actually let myself believe he
cared, that he didn't abandon us.

572
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:00,507
I still believe that.

573
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,676
-How?
-Because I know who your dad was,

574
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:05,429
and we haven't heard his side
of the story yet, you know?

575
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:08,807
Maybe there's a reason
that he's had to stay away.

576
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,308
My whole life?

577
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:13,437
I can't for the life of me wrap my
mind around what that reason would be,

578
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:15,522
but the one thing I do know,

579
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:18,025
is that he loved you more than
anything in the whole world.

580
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,611
Okay.

581
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:24,948
You know, I'm actually
working on a case right now

582
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:28,744
where this father is
estranged from his daughter,

583
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,871
and once he came back
into the picture,

584
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:33,123
the only thing he cared
about was making it right.

585
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,335
And that's what
all this is about?

586
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:38,962
It's part of it.

587
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:43,008
I'm looking for somebody who
needs a heart transplant.

588
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:48,013
Somebody powerful enough to intimidate
an entire hospital to get it.

589
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:51,349
So, I figured I'd start
with their biggest donors.

590
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:53,310
-These guys.
-Mm-hmm.

591
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:56,730
You are looking at a who's
who of LA philanthropy.

592
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,275
What about him?

593
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,904
Carson Wood. Looks like
he's a big producer.

594
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:07,574
This photo wasn't from that premiere.
Do you see who's behind him?

595
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,367
Uh-huh.

596
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:11,912
Oh, my God. Mom, seriously,
do you live under a rock?

597
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:13,914
She's an actress. She's
in, like, everything.

598
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:14,998
-Right.
-Okay.

599
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:17,876
Anyway, this whole thing
went down about this dress.

600
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,712
She dissed the designer, and
they were going back and forth

601
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:24,132
for, like, weeks, but that
happened, like, over a year ago.

602
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:25,550
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

603
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:27,886
Well, look at you.

604
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,847
And you didn't think you
were anything like me.

605
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:35,519
-I mean, first we get arrested together…
-Okay, okay.

606
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,772
-Can we look this guy up?
-Yeah.

607
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:41,650
Let's see.

608
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:44,903
Here he is.

609
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:47,656
Mmm, old.

610
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:49,741
Old.

611
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:52,161
-All these are old.
-Yeah. That one's definitely old.

612
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:56,206
Okay, so if you're right, this guy
hasn't been seen in public for months,

613
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:59,334
but he's posting old pictures
as if they're recent.

614
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,628
-Shady.
-Might be more than shady.

615
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:04,172
Maybe he's been hiding
the fact that he's sick.

616
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,432
-Everything good with Morgan?
-Yeah.

617
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:17,394
She had to visit Ava's school, clear
up a little truancy thing yesterday.

618
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:18,478
What's going on here?

619
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:20,814
Showed up just as Carson
Wood was about to head out.

620
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:23,150
I suggested he wait, his
people didn't like that.

621
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:24,901
So you decided to
block the driveway.

622
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:27,445
-Things are getting a little tense.
-Copy that.

623
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,031
Carson Wood.

624
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:33,451
Detectives Karadec and Forrester, LAPD.
Mind if we ask you a few questions?

625
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:36,454
If it gets you the hell out
of my driveway, ask away.

626
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:37,873
Make it quick.

627
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,584
Does the name Nathan Gould
mean anything to you?

628
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,294
Should it?

629
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,421
He's a murder victim whose
death we're investigating.

630
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:45,797
Never heard of him.

631
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:47,674
PS, I don't know if
you looked at me,

632
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:50,760
but I'm literally on my way
to get a heart transplant.

633
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:52,888
I'm not running
around killing people.

634
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,682
Well, uh, now that you mention
it, one of the reasons we're here

635
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:57,893
is to see if you're in the
market for a new heart, sir.

636
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,646
We believe Mr. Gould was killed so that
his would be available for transplant.

637
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:03,232
As for killing him yourself, I think
you could hire some people to do it.

638
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:04,482
I can't argue with that.

639
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:06,818
Hey, Karadec.

640
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:09,529
The GPS is set for the
airport, not St. Clair's.

641
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,991
Mr. Wood, would we be right that
you pressured St. Clair's Hospital

642
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:14,701
to bump you to the top
of their transplant list?

643
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:17,287
Maybe I did. Maybe I
didn't. Doesn't matter.

644
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,456
Got a better heart
waiting for me in Utah.

645
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:22,209
Wait, so you're saying you
don't want Nathan Gould's heart?

646
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:24,002
Is that the one at St. Clair's?

647
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:28,381
Doc said it wasn't a great match,
technical stuff, not my department.

648
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:32,594
And if that concludes our business, I'd
appreciate you getting out of the way.

649
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,429
Time's the one
thing I don't have.

650
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:39,476
Hey, how'd it go at the school?

651
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,603
I convinced him that 30
minutes in a holding cell

652
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,939
can serve as detention, but
whatever. That's not why I called.

653
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,858
I got a message from Soto.
St. Clair's Hospital called.

654
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:48,026
Oh, yeah, yeah, we know.

655
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,320
Carson Wood didn't even
need Nathan's heart.

656
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:51,864
Guessing it got put
back into the system?

657
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:54,616
Well, it would've,
but it's been stolen.

658
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:57,202
-How does someone steal a heart?
-That's what we're trying to figure out.

659
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,329
Hospital said everything went
normally with the organ removal.

660
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,623
They took the heart out of Nathan,
they packed up the transport.

661
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,750
That's when it was supposed to
be driven to another hospital.

662
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,210
But that's when everyone
lost track of it.

663
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:07,588
Someone with knowledge of the
process intercepted the heart

664
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:08,839
on its way out of the building.

665
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:11,175
So far, we haven't spotted anything
on the hospital surveillance,

666
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:12,384
but we're still looking.

667
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:16,096
How much time can pass between taking out
a heart and putting it into someone else?

668
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:19,349
Hospital says six hours tops,
two of which have already passed.

669
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:21,352
Then that's how
much time we have.

670
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:25,146
Someone this killer cares about is
about to get a heart transplant,

671
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,440
which means our best
chance to find the killer

672
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:29,859
is while that person is
still in a hospital bed.

673
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:32,779
After the patient's safe and sound,
our guy could be in the wind.

674
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:36,366
Now, it felt like the transplant
coordinator was hiding things yesterday.

675
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:38,576
Let's have her back
in for a conversation.

676
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,663
Now that the pressure's off from Wood,
maybe she'll be more forthcoming.

677
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:42,831
Yeah.

678
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,458
I'm starting to feel like
I should have a lawyer.

679
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:47,335
Oh, that's definitely
a way you could go,

680
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:49,713
given that we could charge you
with obstructing an investigation.

681
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:52,216
You might lose your job, so
lawyering up might be the smart move.

682
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:55,802
But, the truth is, we're not
looking to come after you.

683
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:58,722
We need to find Nathan Gould's
killer, and we need to find him now.

684
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:02,309
If you help us, we'd be inclined
to forget your role in all of this.

685
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:03,768
My role in this?

686
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:07,147
I didn't have a choice.

687
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:12,485
If we didn't find Mr. Wood a heart, he
would have cut off millions in funding.

688
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:16,114
That's money we use to
save countless lives.

689
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:18,116
We're not here to judge.

690
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:23,330
Okay.

691
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:24,957
We have reason to
believe that at one point

692
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,500
Nathan Gould and his
killer were cooperating.

693
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:30,837
Let's say Carson Wood never interfered.
Who would have gotten the heart then?

694
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:35,216
Nathan Gould left behind
a directed donation.

695
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,927
He named the person he
wanted his heart to go to.

696
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:42,265
And when Mr. Wood pressured
us to find him a heart,

697
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:48,104
the committee and I, we
invalidated Mr. Gould's directive.

698
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:52,984
-Whose name was on the directed donation?
-I don't know.

699
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:56,446
I deleted any record
on the hospital system.

700
00:35:56,529 --> 00:36:00,575
You deleted the intended recipient's name,
and you don't even remember who it was?

701
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:02,327
It's not that I don't remember.

702
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:04,454
I didn't even look.

703
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:09,084
That person is something
I don't wanna think about.

704
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:14,756
So, their name should still be
on the transplant list, right?

705
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:17,425
Yeah.

706
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,679
Is this the information we got
from the transplant coordinator?

707
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:21,971
-The UNOS database?
-Yes.

708
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:24,683
You're looking at everyone waiting on a
heart in the southwestern United States.

709
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:27,519
Good, because that heart only has
about two hours of viability left.

710
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:28,978
How we gonna narrow this down?

711
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:44,244
Mm-mmm. No. Okay.

712
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:51,042
This one, this one, this one all live
too far away to get the heart in time.

713
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:54,671
These are the wrong blood type.

714
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,426
And since a key factor in
a heart match is body size.

715
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:02,512
You're out. You're out.
You're definitely out.

716
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,307
-There we go.
-Hey, good work, Morgan.

717
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:08,101
We can just reach out to
each of these hospitals...

718
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,811
No, we won't have to.

719
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:12,856
I gotta check something real
quick, but if I'm right,

720
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,150
I know where to find the killer.

721
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:24,826
Rosemary Caferri, 70 years old at Eaton
General, in end-stage heart failure.

722
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,495
-She's the one getting the heart.
-How did you know?

723
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:30,999
Because she was the only one left whose
profile said she was on Albuterol.

724
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,836
Yeah, paramedics said people were stealing
Albuterol because of a drug shortage.

725
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,880
I don't doubt that there
was a drug shortage,

726
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:41,384
but people were not stealing Albuterol,
one of the paramedics was, for his mother.

727
00:37:41,468 --> 00:37:43,553
-That's what you had to check.
-That's right.

728
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:46,055
Caferri was Rosemary's
second husband's last name.

729
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:50,810
Her first husband was a Bishop, just like
one of our paramedics, Christopher Bishop.

730
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:52,395
He's Rosemary's son.

731
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:56,316
Christopher and Nathan knew each
other because of Nathan's injuries.

732
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,360
They must have shared their
struggles with each other.

733
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:00,403
So when Nathan decided
to end his life,

734
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:02,447
he offered to direct his
heart to Christopher's mother.

735
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,115
But then Nathan
changed his mind.

736
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:06,785
Which meant Christopher had to
take matters into his own hands.

737
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:09,412
He staged the messy
tables to make sure that

738
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:11,664
Nathan sat exactly
where he wanted him to…

739
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,828
…and then he dragged
his body into the alley.

740
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,887
And he set an alarm to make sure
that someone would find Nathan

741
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,430
at exactly the right time.

742
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:33,854
This even explains
the where and when.

743
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:36,440
Close enough to Christopher's firehouse
so he could show up to his shift

744
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:38,358
before the call came in
and give himself an alibi.

745
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:41,611
And he could make sure that he was
the paramedic who was taking the call.

746
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,530
He did all this to
save his dying mother.

747
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:46,825
Well, I'll have unis
posted to stop Christopher

748
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:48,576
and give Eaton
General a heads-up.

749
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:52,372
We're gonna stop her from
getting the heart, aren't we?

750
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:09,264
I had no idea. I swear.

751
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:13,434
I was only told that
a heart was available.

752
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:17,689
Does he know that you know?

753
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,691
He dropped off the heart
along with the paperwork

754
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,484
saying it was for
you, and he left.

755
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:24,487
Mr. Gould's directed donation
was still on file here too.

756
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:26,906
We had the hospital text
Christopher as your next of kin

757
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:29,367
and say they needed him to
come back, which he did.

758
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:31,244
We have him in custody now.

759
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,414
He's gonna go to
prison, isn't he?

760
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:36,291
Um…

761
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,459
You gonna let me see him?

762
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,462
Please.

763
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,304
I'll have my officers
bring him in.

764
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,513
Thank you.

765
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:54,309
Of course, you will go back on the
waiting list for another heart.

766
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:56,936
I really…

767
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,230
I don't really care
about the heart now.

768
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:08,531
Oh, my.

769
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:13,119
My sweet boy.

770
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:15,538
Hey, Mom.

771
00:40:15,622 --> 00:40:17,749
Hi, sweetheart. Hey. Come here.

772
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,293
I'm sorry.

773
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:23,713
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

774
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:26,758
