<i>In chess, it's a variation</i>
<i>of the Queen's Gambit Declined.</i>

A move in which Black
declines White's temporary
pawn sacrifice

What the hell does that mean?

121
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:25,286
It means we have to decline
the temporary sacrifice.

We've got to release
Jason Howard.

Whoa, whoa, Morgan,
you do realize Derek is

I know,
and Maya's still out there too,

125

to get her back
is to play this game.

to hold Jason Howard
much longer anyway.

We suspect he fed Derek
some false information

so that he'd believe you killed
Maya and try to get revenge.

-Three officers

never comes near you,

00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:27,241
Buddy, you want to do
a talent show, you're gonna do
that talent show.

167
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,143
<i>Why don't we just invite</i>
<i>Officer Chester?</i>

168
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:30,711
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

169
00:08:30,845 --> 00:08:32,513
<i>So what are you gonna do?</i>

170
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:34,982
Uh, that's a surprise.
But it's super cool. And I know
you're gonna love it.

171
00:08:35,116 --> 00:08:36,751
- <i>Can you put your dad on?</i>
-Yeah.

172
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,989
I can't tell you what Elliot's
doing for the talent show.
I'm sorry.

173
00:08:42,123 --> 00:08:43,257
What do you mean
you can't tell me?

174
00:08:43,391 --> 00:08:44,558
Elliot swore me to secrecy.

175
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:46,460
Ludo, the kid
gets bullied enough at school.

176
00:08:46,594 --> 00:08:49,130
Now he wants to go up on stage
in front of everyone

177
00:08:49,263 --> 00:08:51,365
and do something
that he considers cool?

178
00:08:51,499 --> 00:08:53,234

-Mom!

181
00:08:57,671 --> 00:08:58,806
He's gonna get eaten alive.

182
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:00,775
He's going to be fine.
I'm going to help him.

183
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:03,477
You? No.
Why would you help him?
You're not...

184
00:09:03,611 --> 00:09:04,645
You're not the one.

185
00:09:06,147 --> 00:09:08,282
-Hey, are you doing okay?
-[Matthew] Hello?

186
00:09:08,983 --> 00:09:10,584
I'll call you back
as soon as I can.

187
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:13,687
[Matthew] Hello?

188
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:16,957
Is anyone there?

189
00:09:18,826 --> 00:09:20,594
I've never been
in one of these rooms before.

190
00:09:21,462 --> 00:09:22,730
I remember hearing about people

191
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:24,298
who would confess
to things they didn't do.

192
00:09:24,432 --> 00:09:25,499
I never understood why.

193
00:09:26,901 --> 00:09:28,335
But now that I'm here,
I get it.

194
00:09:29,837 --> 00:09:31,272
These concrete walls.

195
00:09:32,807 --> 00:09:33,841
The glass.

196
00:09:34,642 --> 00:09:36,744
I only got in trouble once
when I was a kid.

197
00:09:38,513 --> 00:09:41,182
Some friends and I
were playing chicken.

198
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,785
We were biking
right toward each other.

199
00:09:50,191 --> 00:09:51,425
Don't blink.

200
00:09:56,664 --> 00:09:58,132
You swerve, you lose.

201
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,274
Hmm.

202
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:13,614
-[door opens]
-[Selena] Morgan, you gotta go.

203
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:15,816
We heard about a bomb threat
on a Metro bus.

204
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,587
-What about this guy?
-We believe the threat was him.

205
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,961
Someone on the bus heard it
ticking and called 9-1-1.

206
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:29,396
-Anyone see who left the bag?
-No.

207
00:10:29,531 --> 00:10:31,465
-And the cameras
on the bus were broken.
-Where's the bomb?

208
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,033
There wasn't one. [sighs]

209
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:36,770
It's just a timer
with a thumb drive
taped to the back.

210
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:40,174
I recognized your woman.

213

She's singing
"Bizarre Love Triangle"
by New Order.

214
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:52,186
That's why Matthew Clark
mentioned a love triangle
in his interrogation.

215
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:54,388
-When was this video recorded?
-Wish I could tell you.

216
00:10:54,523 --> 00:10:56,190
Whoever made the video wiped
all the metadata.

217
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:57,892
Okay. That means
even after we find Derek,

218
00:10:58,025 --> 00:11:00,261
we can't use this video
to prove to him
that Maya's still alive.

219
00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:03,898
It gets weirder.
The bag tested positive
for ammonium nitrate,

220
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:05,567
a chemical used in bomb making.

221
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:08,435
Okay, so he wants us to know
there is a bomb.
It's just not here.

222
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,070
And we have less than
two hours to stop it.

223
00:11:10,204 --> 00:11:12,673
[Morgan] "Helen of Monaco."
I don't recognize that brand.

224
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:15,109
It's a brand-new bag.
What's with this loose thread?

225
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:16,611
You think
that means something?

226
00:11:16,744 --> 00:11:18,479
Everything means something
with him.

227
00:11:27,321 --> 00:11:28,355
[Morgan] Oh, my God.

228
00:11:37,064 --> 00:11:39,200
We need to know when
this bus started its route,

229
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,268
because if it was after Matthew
walked into our precinct,

230
00:11:41,402 --> 00:11:43,070
he just gave himself
the best alibi ever.

231
00:11:43,204 --> 00:11:45,839
Yeah, the entire Los Angeles
Police Department.

232
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:57,851
Roman Sinquerra.

233
00:11:58,319 --> 00:12:01,021
We're Detectives Ozdil
and Forrester with the LAPD.

234
00:12:01,556 --> 00:12:02,657
-What, you guys lost?
-No.

235
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,258
No, we just want to talk to you
for a minute.

236
00:12:07,328 --> 00:12:08,462
I gotta be somewhere.

237
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,205
[Morgan] What am I missing?
There's got to be
something here.

238
00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:20,374
Yeah, well, I hope
you're right, 'cause we're
running out of time.

239
00:12:20,508 --> 00:12:22,109
I had the techs put a rush
on that bag.

240
00:12:22,243 --> 00:12:24,178
The only DNA they're gonna find
on that bag is

241
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:26,280
from whoever Matthew paid
to drop it on the bus,

242
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:27,716
and I doubt he showed them
his face.

243
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:29,316
Lieutenant must still be in
with him.

244
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:31,118
Here.

245
00:12:32,453 --> 00:12:34,221
-[phone buzzing]
-It's Oz.

246
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:38,792
[sighs]

247
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:41,195
Hey, any news?

248
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:42,429
We found Roman.

249
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:45,567
<i>He wouldn't talk with us,</i>
<i>so we're tailing him now.</i>

250
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,202
There he goes.

251
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,038
[Oz]
I'm sending you a photo now.

252
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:52,741
[phone buzzes]

253
00:13:07,288 --> 00:13:08,657
That's not Roman.

254
00:13:10,324 --> 00:13:11,559
[Daphne] Are you sure?

255
00:13:12,393 --> 00:13:14,962
Got a fairly decent look
at the guy
when we had a child together.

256
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:16,665
So, yeah, pretty sure.

257
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:18,899
I've never seen that man before
in my life.

258
00:13:19,033 --> 00:13:20,834
Okay, then we need to find out
who he is

259
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:23,337
and why he's using Roman's name
out here in Nevada.

260
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,639
Thank you.

261
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:27,141

-[Oz] <i>How's that other thing?</i>

262
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:29,910
Oh, you mean catching the guy
who tried to drown
my favorite coworker?

264
00:13:31,513 --> 00:13:33,147
-I get it.
-Just be careful.

00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:34,848
You too.

266
00:13:37,251 --> 00:13:38,452
Gotta go. [grunts]

267
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:41,355
-[exhales sharply]
-Hey, you good?

268
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:45,993
[sighs] Good enough.

269
00:13:47,796 --> 00:13:49,229
What more do you want me
to say?

270
00:13:49,363 --> 00:13:51,098
You could start
with a solid alibi.

271
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:54,902
I can't be the only person
in this city who stays
at home to read.

272
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:59,373
Only one suspected
of abducting four people,
including one of my own.

273
00:13:59,507 --> 00:14:01,909
Go ahead,
check my bank accounts, my car.

274
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:03,911
Hell, you can search
my apartment.

275
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:06,648
You consent to a warrantless
search of your place?

276
00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:08,449
Knock yourselves out.

277
00:14:09,517 --> 00:14:10,685
I've got nothing to hide.

278
00:14:12,554 --> 00:14:15,356
He wouldn't let us
in that apartment if there
wasn't something to find.

279
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,426
We checked the units above,
below and on either side.

280
00:14:19,561 --> 00:14:21,830
No trace of any explosives.
You're good to go.

281
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:27,736
[Morgan] Come on.
What's this man trying
to tell me?

282
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:29,303
[Karadec]
That he likes monkeys.

283
00:14:30,371 --> 00:14:31,539
Morgan, we gotta hustle.

284
00:14:31,673 --> 00:14:32,906
Less than an hour
before a bomb might go off,

285
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,375
and we still have no idea
where Maya is.

286
00:14:34,509 --> 00:14:36,377
So far all we've learned
about Matthew Clark

287
00:14:36,511 --> 00:14:38,245
is he volunteers
at the local hospital.

288
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,718
-He said he was reading
last night, right?
-Yeah, not the best alibi.

289
00:14:43,852 --> 00:14:46,987
So maybe it wasn't an alibi.

290
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:49,591
Maybe it's a clue.

291
00:15:02,504 --> 00:15:03,538
This one's upside down.

292
00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:08,175
It's about the man
who saved the world,
Stanislav Petrov.

293
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:09,943
Please give me
the shortest possible version.

294
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:12,045
Petrov was a Soviet colonel
during the Cold War.

[panting]

299
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:26,628
If Petrov had reported
the alert, it would have
started that nuclear war.

300
00:15:26,761 --> 00:15:28,429
Okay, I get it.
He's sending us a message,

301
00:15:28,563 --> 00:15:31,432
but I mean, it's not exactly
a crime to improperly
shelve your books.

302
00:15:31,566 --> 00:15:33,367
What does that mean?

303
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,570
I'm saying we have to let
Matthew go and keep searching
for Maya and Derek.

304
00:15:35,703 --> 00:15:38,005
-What? Are you insane?
-Morgan,
we don't have any evidence.

305
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:40,407
No, it's not a game anymore.
This is about escalation.

306
00:15:40,542 --> 00:15:42,109
He's telling us this is war.

Let me see that video
of Maya again.

310
00:15:49,517 --> 00:15:51,418
-What, you think
we missed something?
-Yeah, pull up Maya's video.

-Okay.

In the Vietnam War,

He's never targeted

Well, that depends.

a little bit nervous.

You and I are not like
other people, and honestly,
I think that's cool,

a little bit of a target,
right?

You know what? I'm actually
dealing with a bully
at my work right now.

why I'm feeling
a little overprotective,

to be scared.

a book about Stanislav Petrov.

to be more like Petrov.

I think the only way
I can beat this guy...

on Derek's credit card,

494
00:25:51,018 --> 00:25:52,086
a location on the east side.

495
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:53,921
-Morgan's not answering.
-We'll keep trying her.

496
00:25:54,055 --> 00:25:56,857
Right now, I need you
to make sure we get to Jason
before Derek does.

497
00:25:56,991 --> 00:25:58,325
Send me the address.

498
00:26:00,061 --> 00:26:02,063
I wish I could help you,
Morgan, but like I said,

499
00:26:02,196 --> 00:26:04,098
I don't know anything
about this missing woman.

500
00:26:04,698 --> 00:26:05,733
What?

501
00:26:06,567 --> 00:26:08,702
That's it? Nothing?

502
00:26:10,638 --> 00:26:13,207
No, no, come on, no, I...
I gave you what you wanted.

503
00:26:13,874 --> 00:26:15,476
I quit, you won.

504
00:26:15,609 --> 00:26:16,977
The game is over.

505
00:26:17,111 --> 00:26:18,913
I really do hope you find her.

506
00:26:20,347 --> 00:26:21,582
[gasps]

507
00:26:27,855 --> 00:26:28,923
Hey, Morgan.

508
00:26:31,058 --> 00:26:32,660
It's an old building.

509
00:26:32,793 --> 00:26:34,595
The elevator's been acting up.
You should probably
play it safe.

510
00:26:36,464 --> 00:26:37,631
Take the stairs.

511
00:26:43,204 --> 00:26:45,172
[Jason] I don't belong
in this situation.

512
00:26:45,306 --> 00:26:49,343
You guys are gonna eat
with me, right?
I feel like I'm in a cage.

513
00:26:49,477 --> 00:26:52,146
-[security]
Stay in the room, sir.
-I need some air.

514
00:26:52,947 --> 00:26:54,615
[Jason] I'll be right there.

515
00:26:57,118 --> 00:26:58,385
Morgan, where are you?

516
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,920
Just checking something out.
You?

517
00:27:00,054 --> 00:27:01,956
Derek just checked into a hotel
on the east side.

518
00:27:02,089 --> 00:27:03,791
<i>We think Jason did too,</i>
<i>but he's not picking up,</i>

519
00:27:03,924 --> 00:27:05,960
<i>so I'm headed over there to try</i>
<i>to find him before Derek does.</i>

520
00:27:06,093 --> 00:27:08,162
-Do you hear that?
-[song playing in distance]

521
00:27:08,295 --> 00:27:10,664
-"Bizarre Love Triangle."
<i>-Where are you?</i>

522
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:12,733
I'm at Matthew's
apartment building,
third floor.

523
00:27:12,867 --> 00:27:14,969
-Maya. [panting]
<i>-What the hell are you doing</i>
<i>over there?</i>

524
00:27:15,102 --> 00:27:16,804
-Maya!
- <i>Morgan, I'm sending backup.</i>

525
00:27:16,937 --> 00:27:18,439
No, I'm fine.
Go get Jason. Maya!

526
00:27:18,573 --> 00:27:20,509
- <i>Morgan. Morgan, hello?</i>
-Maya!

527
00:27:23,612 --> 00:27:24,812
LAPD.

528
00:27:26,615 --> 00:27:29,083
Hey, Jason and Derek both
checked in a half hour ago.

529
00:27:29,817 --> 00:27:32,319
Morgan? Morgan, talk to me.

530
00:27:33,354 --> 00:27:35,256
Oh, God. That sucks.

531
00:27:35,756 --> 00:27:37,725
[grunting]

532
00:27:37,858 --> 00:27:39,193
[panting]

533
00:27:39,727 --> 00:27:41,428
Hi, yeah, you want...
you wanna help out?

534
00:27:41,563 --> 00:27:43,164
Go get the super or something.

535
00:27:43,297 --> 00:27:45,799
Come on. Maya! [panting]

536
00:27:45,933 --> 00:27:47,801
I know this looks weird, okay?

537
00:27:47,935 --> 00:27:50,204
Don't you call the cops.
I'm on the phone with one.

538
00:27:51,438 --> 00:27:52,507
Maya!

539
00:27:58,245 --> 00:27:59,446
Another?

540
00:27:59,914 --> 00:28:02,950
Oh.
No, another's not gonna help.

541
00:28:11,792 --> 00:28:13,227
I'm on the roof.

542
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,863
[Morgan] <i>Karadec, we're calling</i>
<i>for the super. He has a key.</i>

543
00:28:16,363 --> 00:28:17,666
I've got eyes on Jason.

544
00:28:19,668 --> 00:28:20,834
Don't do it!

545
00:28:20,968 --> 00:28:22,736
Derek! Derek! No! No! No!

546
00:28:25,339 --> 00:28:26,707
LAPD! Guns down!

547
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,677
[Morgan]
<i>Oh, my God. What's going on?</i>

548
00:28:28,809 --> 00:28:29,843
Now.

549
00:28:32,681 --> 00:28:34,114
Derek, I need you
to listen to me, man.

550
00:28:34,248 --> 00:28:35,684
-Okay?
-He killed her.

551
00:28:35,816 --> 00:28:37,751
-[Jason]
I've never killed anybody.
-You sick bastard.

552
00:28:37,885 --> 00:28:39,119
[Jason whimpers]

553
00:28:39,253 --> 00:28:41,088
<i>Maya.</i> [stutters]
<i>I got her right here.</i>

554
00:28:41,222 --> 00:28:42,923
Derek, Maya is alive.

555
00:28:43,057 --> 00:28:44,593
Okay, Maya,
I work with the police,

556
00:28:44,725 --> 00:28:47,094
and Derek
is about to kill someone
who he thinks killed you,

557
00:28:47,228 --> 00:28:48,762
and I need you to tell him
that you're alive. Okay?

558
00:28:48,896 --> 00:28:50,064
-Why do you lie to me?
-[Maya] <i>Derek!</i>

559
00:28:50,197 --> 00:28:52,900
-He killed her.
-[Maya] <i>Derek, Derek, I'm okay.</i>

560
00:28:53,033 --> 00:28:56,237
I'll never see her again
and I'll never be able
to make it up to her. [cries]

561
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:58,872
Morgan, I need you to keep her
talking, personal details,
whatever it takes.

562
00:28:59,006 --> 00:29:00,274
<i>Make him believe it.</i>

563
00:29:01,075 --> 00:29:04,378
[stammering] Derek, we were...
We were married
in Santa Barbara and...

564
00:29:04,512 --> 00:29:07,414
and we always... We never took
a honeymoon, but we always said
we were going to.

565
00:29:07,549 --> 00:29:09,250
And-And Max when he was born,

566
00:29:09,383 --> 00:29:10,784
-we barely made it
to the hospital...
-Maya?

567
00:29:10,918 --> 00:29:12,753
...and he was eight pounds
and seven ounces.

568
00:29:12,886 --> 00:29:15,289
And I want you to see him
again, Derek. [sobbing]

569
00:29:19,893 --> 00:29:20,961
It's her.

570
00:29:24,932 --> 00:29:26,166
Sorry.

571
00:29:29,069 --> 00:29:32,373
I'm sorry. Okay.
I'm sor-sorry. It was...

572
00:29:32,507 --> 00:29:35,276
[pants] You did it.
You did it. It's okay.

573
00:29:35,409 --> 00:29:37,177
-Is Max okay?
-Yes, he's fine.

574
00:29:37,712 --> 00:29:39,179
-He's okay. It's okay.
-[cries]

575
00:29:39,313 --> 00:29:40,414
It's okay.

576
00:29:45,085 --> 00:29:46,287
It's okay. [panting]

577
00:29:48,322 --> 00:29:50,625
-Someone's here to see you.
-[Max] Mom!

578
00:29:55,429 --> 00:29:58,165
-I missed you so much, baby.
-I missed you too.

579
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:03,103
[mouthing words] Thank you.

580
00:30:06,373 --> 00:30:08,375
DA still doesn't think
there's enough evidence

581
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:10,144
to arrest Matthew
for Maya's abduction.

582
00:30:10,277 --> 00:30:12,547
What are you talking about?
We found her
in his apartment building.

583
00:30:12,681 --> 00:30:15,215
Yeah, well, the landlord says
the apartment's been vacant
for weeks

584
00:30:15,349 --> 00:30:16,917
and CSU still hasn't found
anything yet.

585
00:30:17,051 --> 00:30:19,420
And since Maya didn't see
the man who abducted her...

586
00:30:19,554 --> 00:30:21,188
Then we are right back
where we started.

587
00:30:22,156 --> 00:30:24,858
Hey, don't worry,
he'll see the inside
of a prison cell soon.

588
00:30:26,026 --> 00:30:27,328
I don't think so.

589
00:30:28,996 --> 00:30:30,699
[sighs]

590
00:30:30,831 --> 00:30:33,033
Do you remember the photograph
of the monkey we found
in his apartment?

591
00:30:33,735 --> 00:30:35,035
It's a tarsier monkey.

592
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:37,037
I think he hung it up
on the wall as a reminder.

593
00:30:37,171 --> 00:30:38,339
A reminder of what?

594
00:30:38,472 --> 00:30:40,974
Tarsier monkeys refuse
to be taken into captivity.

595
00:30:41,108 --> 00:30:42,577
The second they get inside
of a cage,

596
00:30:42,711 --> 00:30:45,580
they get so stressed out that
they start to self-mutilate

597
00:30:45,714 --> 00:30:48,516
and try and kill themselves.

598
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:50,518
You're saying
he won't be taken alive.

599
00:30:51,452 --> 00:30:53,153
Hey, look who's back.

600
00:30:53,287 --> 00:30:55,389
Sorry, we didn't bring you
a souvenir from Vegas.

601
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:58,058
I'm sorry
we didn't catch the guy.

602
00:30:58,192 --> 00:31:01,395
It's all right.
[sighs] Secretly hoping to put
the cuffs on him myself.

603
00:31:01,529 --> 00:31:03,897
Hey, guys, take a look at this.
Maya's medical records
just came in.

604
00:31:04,031 --> 00:31:07,535
No broken bones, no bruises,
no drugs in her system.

605
00:31:08,435 --> 00:31:10,705
How do you abduct someone
without leaving a scratch?

606
00:31:12,707 --> 00:31:15,876
The blood in the trunk
matched Maya's,
and she didn't have any cuts.

607
00:31:17,311 --> 00:31:19,313
How's it possible?

608
00:31:23,016 --> 00:31:28,122
Because the blood
didn't leave Maya's body
within the last 48 hours.

609
00:31:32,694 --> 00:31:33,994
What are you thinking?

610
00:31:39,032 --> 00:31:40,067
[knocks on door]

611
00:31:46,574 --> 00:31:48,208
You're back. Please.

612
00:31:57,451 --> 00:32:00,387
To what do I owe this pleasure?

613
00:32:00,855 --> 00:32:04,158
Oh, you know, I just...
I was reading about your mom.

614
00:32:05,192 --> 00:32:06,427
Oh.

615
00:32:07,896 --> 00:32:10,765
Yeah, she worked at a hotel
in Bel Air, is that right?

616
00:32:10,899 --> 00:32:13,835
Up until the point
where she was accused
of stealing by a guest.

617
00:32:15,068 --> 00:32:16,970
-My mom never stole anything.
-Oh.

618
00:32:17,471 --> 00:32:20,207
But in her file,
it's pretty clear
she confessed.

619
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,109
It was a forced confession.

620
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:23,977
But she still died in jail,
right?

621
00:32:24,111 --> 00:32:27,114
Left you bouncing around from
family member to family member,

622
00:32:27,247 --> 00:32:29,483
just being a lonely kid
with nobody to play with.

623
00:32:29,617 --> 00:32:30,652
[chuckles]

624
00:32:31,886 --> 00:32:35,322
See, I don't think you ever
meant to hurt Maya at all.

625
00:32:35,456 --> 00:32:37,324
I think you were just trying
to get my attention,

626
00:32:37,458 --> 00:32:40,294
but you did need for Derek
to think that Maya was dead.

627
00:32:40,427 --> 00:32:42,730
[Matthew, distorted]
This is the LAPD.
It's about Maya.

628
00:32:42,864 --> 00:32:45,667
'Cause he needed to be
mad enough to go kill Jason.

629
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,968
Thus the blood.

630
00:32:48,101 --> 00:32:49,269
[chuckles]

631
00:32:49,403 --> 00:32:51,840
-I don't understand.
-Yeah, that happens a lot.

632
00:32:51,972 --> 00:32:53,140
Let me help you.

633
00:32:53,273 --> 00:32:55,944
Maya's blood was
on the dagger in her trunk,

634
00:32:56,076 --> 00:32:58,111
but Maya didn't have any cuts
on her,

635
00:32:58,245 --> 00:33:00,648
so that leads me to ask myself,

636
00:33:00,782 --> 00:33:03,116
where the heck did that blood
come from, right?

637
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:07,421
And then I remembered, uh,
this guy is such a good guy

638
00:33:07,555 --> 00:33:09,524
he volunteers
at his local hospital,

639
00:33:09,657 --> 00:33:12,961
the very same hospital
where Maya donated blood.

640
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:22,302
Maybe your mom wasn't a thief,
but her son sure is.

641
00:33:22,436 --> 00:33:24,539
I was just texting
with my partner.

642
00:33:24,672 --> 00:33:26,039
Yeah, they checked the footage
at the hospital.

643
00:33:26,173 --> 00:33:28,442
Sure enough, there you are,
stealing Maya's blood.

644
00:33:29,443 --> 00:33:32,747
So officers will be here
any minute to arrest you now,

645
00:33:32,881 --> 00:33:34,883
but I just wanted to make sure
that I got here first

646
00:33:35,015 --> 00:33:37,484
'cause I really wanted
to see your face

647
00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:38,887
when you realized...

648
00:33:39,821 --> 00:33:41,355
you will end up in a cage.

649
00:33:45,693 --> 00:33:46,761
Well played.

650
00:33:57,437 --> 00:33:58,573
She was a good mom.

651
00:33:59,807 --> 00:34:00,842
She worked so hard.

652
00:34:01,643 --> 00:34:03,343
She always made time for me.

653
00:34:03,845 --> 00:34:05,013
Gosh,

654
00:34:05,145 --> 00:34:06,948
I bet she would be so proud

655
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,817
that you honored her memory
by harming another mom.

656
00:34:11,019 --> 00:34:12,452
I never hurt anyone.

657
00:34:14,022 --> 00:34:17,090
Oh, it didn't hurt Maya
to be kidnapped and taken away
from her child?

658
00:34:17,224 --> 00:34:19,126
What about Jason?
