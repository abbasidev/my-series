1
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,000
GUNSHOT AND SCREAMING

2
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,680
WOMAN CRIES OUT

3
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,520
Pete!

4
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:54,760
Evie! Evie, stop!

5
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,520
Evie!

6
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,640
Evie, stop!

7
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,120
Pete. Stop.

8
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,200
Stop.

9
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,280
GUNSHOT

10
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,440
Hello, suburbia! Woo.

11
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,560
Can almost feel the curtains
twitching already.

12
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,720
Look, I mean, I was only joking,

13
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,440
but they are actually staring
at us.

14
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,200
Hey, we are the new kids on
the block.

15
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,680
People are gonna be interested.
Come on.

16
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,240
Hey, I'm sold.

17
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,280
Bit Desperate Housewives, maybe,
But it's nice.

18
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,800
Olly, your dinner's served.

19
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,760
Here we go.

20
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,800
Hello.

21
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,840
Hiya.

22
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,440
Welcome. I'm Becka.

23
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,240
Hiya. Oh, hiya, Becka,
Evie. This is Pete.

24
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,560
Hello. Hi. Oh, my God.

25
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,320
It is so good to have some new young
blood on the street.

26
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,960
Oh, my God. How many weeks,
are you?

27
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
24.

28
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,480
Congratulations. I loved being
pregnant.

29
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,200
Oh.

30
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,320
Let me get Danny. He can lift
anything.

31
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,360
No, I'm, I'm OK.

32
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,160
Come on, babe, don't do it
yourself. Be careful.

33
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,280
Danny. Come here.

34
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,360
What?

35
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,920
Babe, this is Pete and Evie.

36
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,480
I've decided that they're adorable.

37
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,200
Hello, new neighbours.

38
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,440
Hiya.

39
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,480
You all right mate?

40
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,720
Yeah, oof.

41
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,840
Let me help you with that.

42
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,240
Yeah, if you go, yeah...

43
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,760
OK, I'll come in and then if I...

44
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,000
Yeah, got it.

45
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,280
Where do you want it, mate?

46
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,240
Well, it's a dishwasher...

47
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,960
See?

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,560
Yeah, yeah.

49
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,840
Ooh, yeah, just careful of the
floor.

50
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,440
Right. What's next?

51
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,840
Ah, well, it's, er, just small stuff
left.

52
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,840
So, weedy old me can manage that.

53
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,480
Oh, no, seriously, I don't mind.

54
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,720
Right, how about a beer for
the hard-working boys.

55
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,240
Now that's an idea.

56
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:57,800
Well, here's to your new home.
And to new friends.

57
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,440
Cheers. Yes. New friends.

58
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,640
You must be stoked about
becoming parents.

59
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,040
Mm, course. Though, you know,

60
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,200
it's a bit hard to imagine till you
actually get there.

61
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,120
Mm. Our Olly is a real chip off
the old block.

62
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,440
He is exactly like his dad in
every way.

63
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,680
Yeah. I know it's a cliche

64
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,720
but it's like everything made sense
once I become a dad.

65
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,160
Yeah, yeah. cos you were forced to
stop being a self-centred shit.

66
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,240
Do you see what I have to put up
with?

67
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,640
I'm worth it.

68
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,480
Ah, babe. You absolutely are. Mm.

69
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,680
Bye.

70
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,720
They were nice.

71
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,880
She was nice enough.

72
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,360
He was a bit much. I'm not sure
they're our type.

73
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,040
What does that mean?

74
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,240
What the Aussie fitness instructor
and what was he,

75
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,480
underwear model I presume.

76
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,360
Oy!

77
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,280
They were very helpful and they were
very friendly.

78
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,760
You're just being mean.

79
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,400
I'm not.

80
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,160
Still, I'll never have to lift
anything ever again.

81
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,160
We're gonna become a family in this
house.

82
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,680
We are.

83
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,600
Hey.

84
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,960
This baby is as much yours as
it's mine.

85
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,920
No-one needs to know how we
got here...

86
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,880
..OK?

87
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,120
I know.

88
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,520
Eat up, mate.

89
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,000
Don't like falafel.

90
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,840
You haven't even tried it.

91
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,120
Stop trying to give me healthy food.
It's so boring.

92
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,280
Don't you encourage him?

93
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,040
What? What? He's right.

94
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,720
Are you finished?

95
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,440
Yeah, well, go get ready for bed,
I'll be up in a minute.

96
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,560
What?

97
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,000
What? Don't do that face. Go!

98
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,920
Go on. Falafel will get you.

99
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,680
What do you think of the new
neighbours?

100
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,800
I feel like they might actually be
our new friends.

101
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,120
Hmm. He didn't like me.

102
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,760
What? Of course he did.

103
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,640
No, I could see exactly what he
was thinking

104
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,080
the moment he clapped eyes on me.

105
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,360
Well, you did take something right
from out of his hands.

106
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,640
Yeah, a dishwasher. He was clearly
struggling.

107
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,520
GIGGLING: Danny!

108
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,120
Well, I think they're exactly what's
been missing from this

109
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,560
godforsaken street.

110
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,680
All right.

111
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,840
Cheers. Cheers.

112
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,520
Here's to falafel.

113
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,960
SHE LAUGHS

114
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:06,000
SINISTER MUSIC

115
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,440
Alan. Dinner's ready.

116
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,520
Just a minute my love. Be right with
you.

117
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,840
All right, don't be too long.

118
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,960
Come on.

119
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,280
Ugh!

120
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,120
Did, er, Danny tell you what he does
for a living?

121
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,440
No. Why?

122
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,960
Come and have a look.

123
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,040
Bloody hell. Is he a cop?

124
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,640
He looks like Terminator.

125
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,960
Try not to sound so aroused.

126
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,760
Oh, yeah, cause you know me,
babe. Men in uniform.

127
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,640
Well, if that's the mood you're in,

128
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,640
I might have to remind you what
I do best.

129
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,280
Yeah. Go on, then. Remind me.

130
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,160
Now class,

131
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,600
I am very excited to introduce your
new teacher, Miss Greenwood.

132
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,880
Hello, Miss Greenwood.

133
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,520
Hi, class 1G. Thank you Miss Atha.

134
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,480
Good luck.

135
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,640
So, who would like to know

136
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,280
a little bit about me?
Yes. You at the back.

137
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,480
Do you live in Leeds?

138
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,680
I do. Yeah, but I've just moved to
a different part,

139
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,320
which is why I've started at this
school.

140
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,360
Yes?

141
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,080
Miss, do you have a baby in your
tummy like my mummy?

142
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,160
I do. Yeah. What's your name?

143
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,320
Molly, Miss.

144
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,720
My mummy said she can feel her
baby kicking.

145
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,200
Really? Oh, well, me too.

146
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,000
What's the baby's name, Miss?

147
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,280
Oh, I don't know yet, but I do quite
like Isla.

148
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,560
Me too.

149
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,720
That's annoyingly good.

150
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,840
That sounds suspiciously like
faint praise.

151
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,880
No, don't.

152
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,040
Don't make me blow smoke up
your arse.

153
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,560
Oh, come on. My battered ego needs a
boost.

154
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:48,280
Oh, OK. Well, you've clearly
conveyed a sense of moral outrage.

155
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,880
It's a compelling story.

156
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,320
I mean this guy's so obviously
corrupt,

157
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,480
and the council keep giving him
contracts.

158
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,720
Has the boss read this?

159
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,800
Peter.

160
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,280
Think I'm about to find out.

161
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,880
I mean, well done, I guess,

162
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,880
but I don't have the resources
for this kind of nonsense.

163
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,680
Oh, come on. This is a no-brainer.
It's a big story.

164
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,040
I can do this around other work.

165
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,360
Yeah. Bullshit.

166
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,400
I know how you operate. I'll lose
you for weeks.

167
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,640
I, I really think this is worth
pursuing boss.

168
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,360
Yeah, in case you two haven't
noticed,

169
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,960
we've only got four staff left.

170
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,040
Don't you think we have
a responsibility to cover this?

171
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,840
I have one responsibility...

172
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,360
..and that is to keep this pitiful
operation going.

173
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,120
Are you telling me to stop working
on this?

174
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,280
Yeah. I'm telling you that the Mayor
is opening

175
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,040
a magnificent new city library
today.

176
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,480
Go and file me a poetic piece of
prose that does it justice.

177
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,040
Oh!

178
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,960
RADIO OPERATOR: Calling all units
for urgent delivery.

179
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,560
Whitwell receiving. What's the
delivery?

180
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,120
Transport needed for a donor heart
from LRH

181
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,440
to Bradford hospital.

182
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,720
No ambulances available and they
need ASAP.

183
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,400
On my way.

184
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,840
SIREN WAILS

185
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,400
Inhale, reach up.

186
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,840
Exhale, down and fold forward.

187
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,640
Inhale, hands on thighs.

188
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,160
Exhale fold.

189
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,640
Jump back into high plank

190
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,440
and push through to downward facing
dog.

191
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,160
Right leg up

192
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,560
and into high lunge,

193
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,880
and through to dancer's pose.

194
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,480
Hold for three breaths.

195
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,920
If you push through your foot,
find a point of focus,

196
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,360
and breathe.

197
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,280
And relax.

198
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,280
Thanks, guys. Have a good day.

199
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,560
See you.

200
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,600
I don't know how you do half
those moves.

201
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,200
Alan, I know you're doing your best

202
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,560
but I think it's better to start
with the beginners' class.

203
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,880
Well, I'm not very good, am I?

204
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,320
It's fine. It can be challenging at
first.

205
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,480
When do you teach beginners?

206
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,640
I don't. My colleagues do.

207
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,880
It says in your leaflet that you do
one-to-one classes

208
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,000
maybe I'd improve if I...

209
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,240
I'm fully booked for one-to-one
classes. Sorry.

210
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,400
Of course.

211
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,800
Well, maybe I'll just soldier on
here then.

212
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,520
I think if you want to continue,

213
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,040
you need to do the beginner's
class.

214
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,600
My colleague Tim is very good,

215
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,080
and he would be more than happy
to teach you.

216
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,240
You can leave that there.

217
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,040
Hi, this is Pete. Leave me a message
and I'll get back to you.

218
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,080
And isn't this a magnificent
building?

219
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,560
Hiya love, baby's just been a bit
quiet,

220
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,600
so I'm just gonna go and have a
check-up.

221
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,880
Erm, I'll keep you posted.
I love you, bye.

222
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,120
It's probably nothing. I just
thought I'd best...

223
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,640
No, you do well. It's always good to
check.

224
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,680
All right.

225
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,000
Let's see where we are, shall we?

226
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,280
I'm going to ask a colleague of mine
to come and have a look.

227
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,600
There's no heartbeat is there?

228
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,600
I just need someone else to check.

229
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,640
Has anyone come with you today?

230
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:14,520
BABY CRYING

231
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:22,560
DRAMATIC MUSIC

232
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,280
Hey, you OK?

233
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,080
My baby's heartbeat has stopped.

234
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,240
It's over.

235
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,920
Oh, darling. Oh, I'm sorry.

236
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,520
OK, come on. Let's get you inside.

237
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,880
Thank you.

238
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,840
I know you don't know me very
well...

239
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,640
..but anything you need...

240
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,400
Would you like some space?

241
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,040
No. Please stay. You're so kind.

242
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,480
It's just...

243
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,360
..we've tried so hard even
to get to this stage.

244
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,200
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

245
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,240
That 50 quid's mine.

246
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,120
I make that five nil.

247
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,600
Quite a tonking that, Danny boy.

248
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,640
Give it a rest, you cocky twat.

249
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,160
There's no need for that.

250
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,560
Sorry, mate.

251
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,480
I should lay off the betting for
a while.

252
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,600
Got some money issues.

253
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,000
Oh, mate, I didn't know.

254
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,080
I'm sorry. Forget about the 50 quid,
then.

255
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,120
It's fine, I lost.

256
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,840
No, I'm serious. Forget about it,
it's nothing.

257
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,560
Is there anything I can help with?

258
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,840
It's complicated.

259
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,160
Well, go on.

260
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,560
I've got a new situation.

261
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,920
I had to dip into savings and,

262
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,280
well, it's not good.

263
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,520
Right.

264
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,360
Well, you know I'm not one for
asking tricky questions, mate,

265
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,320
but if you want to earn some serious
money on the side, I can help you.

266
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,360
Doing what?

267
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,400
Just doing our job.

268
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,560
Just escorting vehicles from point A
to point B,

269
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,080
safely, on an ad-hoc basis.

270
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,800
You're not serious.

271
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,160
I've been doing it for ages.

272
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,800
Have I ever been in trouble? No.

273
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,480
Have I ever been caught? Not once.

274
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,760
Have you lost your mind? You could
lose your job.

275
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,840
Mate, it's the easiest money you
will ever earn.

276
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,360
Oh!

277
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,320
Working for who?

278
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,120
Some businessman.

279
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,160
Look, I've actually got a job coming
up in a bit.

280
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,200
It's gonna run you five grand

281
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,480
for about 30 minutes' work.

282
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,960
I don't know how desperate you are,
do I?

283
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,160
So, just give it a thought.

284
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,160
Pete, where have you been?
Jesus Christ.

285
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,560
Well, I only just heard your
message.

286
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,480
I've been stuck at work. I'm sorry.

287
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,120
What's happened?

288
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,600
Oh, no!

289
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,800
Evie, no.

290
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,600
Come here.

291
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,160
Brought you a beer, mate.

292
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,720
Oh, fuck.

293
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,480
I know it might not feel like it
right now, but...

294
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,680
..you guys will get through this.

295
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,320
We've already been through more
than you can imagine.

296
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,280
Sorry to hear that.

297
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,480
They're huge.

298
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,320
They carp?

299
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,040
They are, yeah.

300
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,080
Koi.

301
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,280
They came with the house,

302
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,640
but I really like them, actually.

303
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,840
They're hard work, you know?

304
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,480
Water has to be perfect.

305
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,480
Can't over feed them.

306
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,600
Sensitive buggers.

307
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,920
Aren't we all?

308
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,880
Tell me to piss off.

309
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,800
I know it feels awful right now.

310
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,600
Give it some time.

311
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,000
Maybe you can try again.

312
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,560
No....

313
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,520
..not with my puny sperm.

314
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,160
We had two failed IVF attempts
and, er,

315
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,320
then we had to use a sperm donor
and it still hasn't worked.

316
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,080
I'm sorry, mate.

317
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,680
Oh, I can't tell you how much she
wants kids.

318
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,000
She's been talking about it ever
since we were at Uni.

319
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,760
What, you've been together
that long?

320
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,960
17 years.

321
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
What?

322
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Yeah, I'm her first and only ever
boyfriend.

323
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,080
Seriously. That's amazing.

324
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,440
Evie's gonna turn in. She's pretty
exhausted.

325
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,040
Yeah.

326
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,640
Give you some peace.

327
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,200
Look after each other.

328
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,040
Yeah, will do.

329
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,680
DISTANT VOICE: Evie? Evie?

If you're ready we can start
the induction.

MUSIC CONTINUES

333
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:26,360
# Home and the heart of the fools in

# Do what you're best at, bury the
rest

00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:46,760
# And to the outcome, I say, what a
lifetime of compromise

346
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:55,000
# I put my faith in the tables of
devils and angels

348
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,280
Hello, everyone.

349
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,400
How are you all? Good.

350
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,200
All righty, let's take a pic for
some Thursday motivation.

351
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,200
Perfect. That's stunning.

352
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,800
OK, everybody ready? Yes.

353
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,360
Warm? Yes. Good.

354
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,280
Alan?

355
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,760
What is it love?

356
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,960
Can you just come down
for one minute, please?

357
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,760
Alan.

358
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,400
Alan, have you booked that man
to fit the stairlift?

359
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,760
I, I didn't know we'd even
chosen one.

360
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,200
You said yes.

361
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,520
Well, I probably wasn't listening.
I've been very busy.

362
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:14,440
Well, not too busy to buy things off
Prime.

363
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,000
Yeah, well, that's just a book for
work.

364
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,280
How much are we talking for
a stairlift?

365
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,960
I mean, things are quite tight,
financially.

366
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,120
Yeah, well, how much are you willing
to put a price

367
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,920
on your wife's mobility?

368
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,080
I didn't mean it like that.

369
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,560
Wouldn't it be nice if I was
upstairs again?

370
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,000
You know, so we can be together.

371
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,440
Of course.

372
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,400
Ah, don't you want me up there?

373
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,760
Come on, don't be daft.

374
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,040
I know it's important.

375
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,720
I'll get it sorted.

376
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,360
I wonder how Pete and Evie are
doing.

377
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,000
I really liked spending time
with them.

378
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,680
I know.

379
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,600
Just give them some time.

380
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,600
Yeah.

381
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,200
Danny? Mm.

382
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,480
I'm bored.

383
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,680
What kind of bored?

384
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,960
Oh!

385
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Hm-mm.

386
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,160
She's got that look in her eye.

387
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,880
Have I? Mm.

388
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,320
Is that bad?

389
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,920
Very.

390
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,520
Hey...

391
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,680
..you know that couple that we
met in Marbella? Aah.

392
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,240
Mm-hm.

393
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,760
I was thinking...

394
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,760
..maybe we could look them up. Mm.

395
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,640
Maybe we should.

396
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,040
Oh, yes.

397
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,000
TAXI ENGINE IDLES

398
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,040
CAR DOOR CLOSES

399
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,280
You sure you're OK? I'm fine.

400
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,560
Have you had any counselling, Evie?

401
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,680
Look, Miss Atha, it's been two
months and...

402
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,960
..my GP's cleared me. I'm, I'm good.

403
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,960
Would you like me to explain to
the children?

404
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,960
No, no, no. I'll, erm, I'll do it.

405
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,760
Thank you.

406
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,360
Hiya, class!

407
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,440
Hello, Miss Greenwood.

408
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,800
Hello, Molly.

409
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,080
We should probably get up.

410
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,920
I don't want to go.

411
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,080
They want to see you.

412
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,800
They care about you.

413
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,840
Becka's invited us over for
a barbecue tonight.

414
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,080
Might need it after your mum's
cooking.

415
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,040
We feel your presence here, oh,
Lord.

416
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,280
We feel your presence here,
oh, Lord.

417
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,640
We feel your passion here, oh, Lord.

418
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,600
We feel your passion here,
oh, Lord.

419
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,360
We are born with original sin...

420
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,920
We are born with original sin.

421
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,800
..and if we walk in the way of the
Lord, we will be redeemed.

422
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,200
Say it with me sister,

423
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,840
we will be redeemed if we follow
the light.

424
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,000
Cast off the sin...

425
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,440
Our prayers are with her, Susan.

426
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,760
Thank you.

427
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,280
Hi, Brian.

428
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:03,840
It's all right. It's all right.

429
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,640
I'm sorry for you both.

430
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,600
Thanks, Brian. That's, er, that's
much appreciated.

431
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,320
Did mum make you say that?

432
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,040
Cos I'd imagine that you'd think
it was God's punishment.

433
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,200
Evie.

434
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,160
This is, it's really delicious,
Susan.

435
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,520
Actually, I want to know.

436
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,080
Do you think losing my baby is

437
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,360
God's punishment because we used
IVF?

438
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,160
I'm not judging you my child,

439
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,000
but I know what the good book says.

440
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:56,680
Behold children are a heritage from
the Lord.

441
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,240
The fruit of the womb, a reward.

442
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,240
It cannot be a gift from
God if it's not natural.

443
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,760
There's always a quote, isn't there?

444
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,200
Well, here's one you made me learn
by heart.

445
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:12,960
I am the Lord who practises
steadfast love,

446
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,240
justice and righteousness here on
the earth.

447
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,680
Where is it?

448
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,920
Where is this steadfast love

449
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,320
this justice from this God of yours?

450
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,400
It's not for us to know God's will,
Evie.

451
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,680
SHOUTS: Don't!

452
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:37,240
If this is truly God's will then
he's no God of mine.

453
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,080
Evie, let's...

454
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,120
..let's leave it now.

455
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,400
You know I never felt welcome
here, Dad...

456
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,040
..even when this was my home.

457
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,680
Same for Rachel.

458
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,760
You can ask her.

459
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,280
That's how you made your own
children feel...

460
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,640
..and you still do.

461
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,960
Excuse me.

462
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,080
Susan.

463
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,440
Wow, that sounds really intense.

464
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,480
Yeah.

465
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,600
Well, it's me versus God, isn't it?

466
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,880
And God always wins.

467
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,040
They're just trapped in their
belief system.

468
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,640
Yeah, which is a cult.

469
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,000
So, in a way you can't blame them.

470
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,320
I bloody well can, Pete.

471
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,920
My sister's just as happy-clappy
as them,

472
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,360
and she's still nice and kind.

473
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,840
It's just not how your parents
should be, is it?

474
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,000
I don't know. I had the complete
opposite.

475
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,640
My dad wasn't even on the scene.

476
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:52,800
And my mum was this... Thank you,
darling. ..this mad hippy.

477
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,440
She pulled me out of school,

478
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,600
we went to the Gold Coast,

479
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:59,000
and she just taught me herself on
the beach.

480
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,880
And she used to have these wild
parties

481
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,440
and all these different guys.

482
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,240
Which is why Becks has absolutely
no boundaries.

483
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,280
Probably.

484
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:10,000
Yeah, he's to Beck's crazy ma
for raising a wild one.

485
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,080
Yeah.

486
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,160
Cheers.

487
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,480
Oh-ho-ho, we've got a thirsty one.

488
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:20,120
Sorry. Wine is the only remedy
for today.

489
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,280
Never apologise.

490
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,760
You do whatever you've got to do.

491
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,480
Shall we get you another one?

492
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,680
Yes. Yes.

493
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,480
Right, what would you like next?

494
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,760
I have got everything. Let's leave
them to it, shall we?

495
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,240
Right. Come on.

496
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,600
Are cops allowed to do that?

497
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,760
Are you gonna dob on me?

498
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,800
Come on, mate, I'm not gonna smoke
the whole thing on me own.

499
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,040
Oh. Go on, then.

500
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,560
Pete, you naughty boy.

501
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,600
Danny, how do you feel about showing
me your sexy motorbike?

502
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,840
Thought you'd never ask.

503
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,240
Check her out.

504
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,440
Wow.

505
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,760
Oh, you know what? I've always
wanted a go on one.

506
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,000
Since when?

507
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,160
There's still some things you don't
know about me, Pete.

508
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,760
You ever been on a bike? No. You
want to put that right?

509
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,240
What? Now?

510
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:48,680
Is this wise? You've been drinking
and smoking.

511
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,200
Ah, it's only a spin round the
block. Come on.

512
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:57,040
# Take my hand, come with me

513
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:04,080
# We can fly over seven seas

514
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:09,320
# Feel the wind against my skin

515
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,880
# I close my eyes and feel my heart
beat... #

516
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,920
Oh.

517
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,240
Do you like it? Yes. I love it.

518
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,600
This is so much fun.

519
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,240
Aah, waah. Whoa.

520
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,280
Hold on.

521
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,320
I am.

522
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,360
Go really fast.

523
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,520
Yes. Are you ready?

524
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,720
Yes.

525
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,640
SHE SCREAMS

526
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,280
ENGINE REVS

527
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,000
Ready, I'm gonna take my hands off.
No.

528
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,120
I'm going. Yes, go.

529
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,760
Yes. You are crazy.

530
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,000
I love it.

531
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,640
Oh, my God. How was it?

532
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,680
It was amazing. I loved it.

533
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,720
Finally.

534
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,120
I've got a hot girl on the back of
my ride.

535
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,600
You are a lucky man.

536
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,400
Oh, Pete, let's get one.

537
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,080
What? Do I even know you?

538
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,120
PHONE RINGS

539
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,280
So much fun. Here you are.

540
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,720
Thank you. Cheers. Cheers.

541
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,760
You all right mate?

542
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,520
Mate, if you want in, this is your
chance.

543
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,680
Go and pick up your police bike and
get your arse

544
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,320
down to the airport within the next
hour.

545
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,440
Copy.

546
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,720
Yeah.

547
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,920
I, er, I've got to go, babe.

548
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,960
What for?

549
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,240
Emergency hospital delivery.
No ambulance available.

550
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,880
Sorry. I'll see you later.

551
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,200
Yeah, bye.

552
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,440
Come on then. Yeah? Yeah, yeah.

553
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:28,800
ENGINE REVVING

554
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,560
All this for a briefcase?
Hilarious, isn't it?

555
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,000
They wouldn't be paying us unless
there was a threat.

556
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,080
Correct. So, let's stay vigilant and
we all get home safe, don't we?

557
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:44,400
You've got to ask yourself why would
they have flown in a load of cash.

558
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,760
I don't want to think about it.

559
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,280
Who's that?

560
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,440
That's the boss. Mr Spencer.

561
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,600
You sure you want to do this?

562
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:29,880
Yeah.

563
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,280
Shall we go upstairs?

564
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,360
No, let's just do it.

565
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,520
What was it?

566
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,480
Another heart transplant.

567
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,120
You OK?

568
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:11,880
Fine. Just a stressful ride.
Hope I made it in time.

569
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,440
You probably saved somebody's life.

570
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,920
I am proud of you every day.

571
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,800
Do you want a hand?

572
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,080
I'm good.

573
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,240
That was different.

574
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:55,040
Well, we've christened the kitchen.

575
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,240
It was fun, wasn't it?

576
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,320
Yeah.

577
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,280
Of course.
