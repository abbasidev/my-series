00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,040
Morning, babe.

2
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,520
Pete?

3
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,160
Pete?

4
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,600
OK, well, look, I, er...
I have to get going.

5
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,360
Have a nice day.
So, you're pregnant.

6
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,360
Your sister spilled the news
on the phone.

7
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,760
Presumably she didn't realise
you hadn't even told me.

8
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,560
I think I can work out why.

9
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,640
No, Pete, no. Look, I just...

10
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,040
I wanted to have some tests first,
just to be sure.

11
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,000
Just before I put us through any
more heartbreak. Is it mine?

12
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,200
What?

13
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,920
Of course, it is!
How can you even ask that?

14
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,880
Look, babe, I am so sorry that
you had to find out like that.

15
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,960
It was never my intention.

16
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,560
I just wanted...to
find the right moment.

17
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,240
I need to go.

Danny. Hey.

20
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,160
Can I talk to you?

21
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm late for work.

22
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,800
Sorry.

23
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,200
Another time, yeah?

24
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,320
I had it blown up.

25
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,400
It's information about
a safe deposit box.

26
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,600
We think he's looking
for the gang's stolen goods.

27
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,600
Possibly diamonds.

28
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,000
Diamonds, eh? The plot thickens.

29
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,960
And you think these cops are working
for Spencer?

30
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,840
Yeah, we're pretty certain
they are.

31
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,200
I'm impressed.

32
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,800
This story has legs.

33
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,240
All Sophie's work.

34
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,720
Your job's at risk, I reckon.

35
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,480
Knew that already.

36
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,120
Well, not quite
a smoking gun yet.

37
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,840
But you're getting there. Agree.

38
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,960
But if we can confirm
the link to the cops,

39
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,560
then we confirm the corruption...
You get me that and we publish.

You know, it was Danny
that wanted to move here.

69
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,360
He said it'd be a safe place
to raise our son.

70
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,120
I told him I didn't like it.

Suburban streets like this,
they creep me out,

I feel like there's always somebody
watching you, someone judging you.

73
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,440
I didn't realise there was
a pervert right across the road,

74
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,040
who had nothing better to do

75
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,760

personal intimate videos,

I will make you account
for how and why you did that.

You broke into our house, Alan.

79
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,920
That's a criminal offence.

80
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,920
Are you jealous of me?

81
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,880
Is that why you wanted
to humiliate me?

82
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,840
What, you can't cope with a woman
having the sexual freedom

83
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,080
to do as she wishes?

84
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,360
Do you think I need punishing?

I am not a nobody.

92
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,040
Yes, you are.

93
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,920
What do you think your wife
will say when I tell her?

94
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,680
You think she'll leave you?

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,960
I would.

I've got the CCTV footage

I reckon we pretend to be
the two o'clock.

101
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,400
So, we need to get there
just before,

102
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,680
but obviously not too close.

103
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,240
We don't want to bump into
the original van.

104
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,920
We're not really gonna do this.

105
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,160
Mate, we need to realise
this could be our last chance.

106
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,200
I've found us a van we can borrow.

107
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,360
Let's just get it done.

108
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,720
Guys, that report on the A61 crash?

109
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,600
Yes! Oh, sorry.
Totally slipped my mind.

110
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,280
I'll have it with you tomorrow.

111
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,600
Good.

112
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,720
What's that?

113
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,800
Just following up on an enquiry.
Missing security van.

114
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,120
Right, well, get that report
on my desk ASAP.

115
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,080
Don't care who does it.
Yes, boss.

116
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,720
So, your last test was,
what, two years ago?

117
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,480
And I think we'd established
that you had low sperm count.

118
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,240
I'm afraid
that's now become more acute.

119
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,960
How acute?

120
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,400
There are no viable sperm
in your sample.

121
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,880
None?

122
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,520
Absolutely none?

123
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,360
I'm afraid not.

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,480

00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,760
Can I go to Roddy's house?

127
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,800
Yeah, of course.

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,360

Haven't seen you for ages?

131
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,400
Yeah, sorry. We've just...
We've been really busy.

132
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,480
Mm. You both been working a lot?

133
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,680
Danny's been on
a lot of night shifts.

134
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,200
Is he working tonight? Yeah.

135
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,840
Oh, that's a shame.
I was gonna invite you over.

00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,160

Well, we've been talking about
coming here for ages.

140
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,720
We have.

141
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,360
You look beautiful.

142
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,880
Glowing even.

143
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,120
There's a good reason for that.

144
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,280
Hmm.

145
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,640
Thanks.

146
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,320
Well, I suppose we've got
something to, er, celebrate.

147
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,600
We do.

148
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,200
Well, you do.

149
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,680
Hmm?

150
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,440
I don't.

151
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,200
You see,

152
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,440
I had this funny feeling
about why you hadn't told me.

153
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,760
Not like you.

154
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,840
So, I thought I'd better check.

155
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,080
Check what?

156
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,680
Remember last time we were
at the fertility clinic,

157
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,120
when we found out
I had a low sperm count?

158
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,240
Well,

159
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:56,360
I went back today, and I'm
afraid the news is quite bad.

160
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,920
I don't have any.

161
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,760
I'm 100% incapable
of giving you a baby.

162
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,320
Or anyone else for that matter.

163
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,560
So, you see...

164
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,720
..you must have fucked him.

165
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,600
And he must have come inside you

166
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,240
and, I don't know,
maybe that was always your plan.

167
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,640
Plan?!

168
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,640
I think the condom split.

169
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,160
Aah.

170
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,720
Look, I get that this is really
hard for you. I do, but...

171
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,120
But we can...

172
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,520
We can...

173
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,040
We can what? Hmm?

174
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,400
Do you think we're just gonna
go ahead like this is normal?

175
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,920
Like I'm gonna have
that man's child?

176
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,920
But this is all we've ever wanted!

177
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,040
Are you unwell?

178
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,160
Do you hear yourself?

179
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,760
I am not having anything
to do with that.

180
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,120
That?

181
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,440
If you don't want this baby,
then Danny and I will.

182
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,120
Oh, yeah!

183
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,360
You think he'd actually want it?

184
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:24,120
Ha! You try telling him,
he'll run a fucking mile.

185
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,720
Our friendship with those two
is done.

186
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,360
And as for that...

187
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,960
..you get rid of it.

188
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,040
No. Mm-hm.

189
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,320
No way.

190
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,840
Seriously.
I'm giving you two days. Hmm?

191
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,840
Two days or we're done.

192
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,800
You know what?

193
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,560
I'm not actually that hungry.

194
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,960
So, I'll just leave you to it.

195
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,920
RINGING TONE

196
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,160
Danny. Hi, what's up?

197
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,640
Becka said you were working late.

198
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,040
Yeah, why?

199
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,000
I really need to see you.

200
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,440
Look, we discussed this.
It's not a good idea.

201
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,880
Look, trust me.

202
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,080
I need to talk to you right now.

203
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,480
Evie, listen to me.

204
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,920
I think you let your imagination
run away with you a little.

205
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,880
Me and you are
not meant to be together.

206
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,200
I have to get back to work.
Let's talk another time, yeah?

207
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,120
HE HANGS UP

208
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,360
# Do you remember

209
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,280
# Our first kiss?

210
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:47,280
# The way I trembled
when I touched your lips

211
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:51,520
# Trying to undress you
by being a fool

212
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:57,760
# I was trying to impress you
by faking my cool... #

213
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,280
I hope you don't mind
me gate-crashing?

214
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,960
Oh, God. My God. Oh, my God!

215
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,440
I thought you said
you couldn't make it!

216
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,760
Changed my mind.

217
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,320
They're good.

218
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,920
Yeah, my friend is the guitarist.

219
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,240
Ah. Cool.

220
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,160
Yeah.

221
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,960
Drink?

222
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,240
Cheers, yeah, G&T, yeah, please.

223
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,720
Mm. And a shot chaser?

224
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,400
Oh, OK.

225
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,000
Go on. Go on.

226
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,800
Um, yeah, thank you...
Thank you for coming.

227
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,280
My pleasure.

228
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,440
Night. Night.

229
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,080
You work too hard.

230
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,840
Evie.

231
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,600
What are you...?

232
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,320
How'd you get in?

233
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,840
Told the bloke at the desk
I'm a relative.

234
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,040
Well, you should not be here.

235
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,320
I had to see you, Danny.

236
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,800
Look, there's something
you need to know.

237
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,440
No, you should go home.

238
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,800
We both know
that's not gonna happen.

239
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,320
So...

240
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,080
Sit.

241
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,240
Evie. I know you want me.

242
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,080
So, you're gonna have me.

243
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,400
How about...

244
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,360
..I make all the decisions?

245
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,720
And then you don't have
to make any.

246
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,520
Hmm?

247
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,080
This is a bad idea.

248
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,640
Yeah?

249
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:32,120
This is a public office.
Anyone could walk in.

250
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,520
Mm.

251
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,360
So, why don't you stop me...

252
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,200
..if it's so fucking dangerous?

253
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,240
HE GROANS

254
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,600
Yeah.

255
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,080
Mm.

Yeah. No...

266
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:15,120
Just, we're colleagues.
That could make it, you know...

267
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,160
No, that's, um...

268
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,880
I'm sorry, that's...

269
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,320

That's totally my fault.

Come on, it takes

Look, I... I do like you, Pete,

273
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,960
I just, you know, you're with Evie
and that makes... Yeah, yeah.

274
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,320
Hmm, yeah.

275
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,320
Um, do you want, er...
I'm gonna get another drink.

276
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,400

# I never thought you'd be the one

278
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,400
We can't do that again.

279
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,160
I'm pregnant.

280
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,160
It's yours.

281
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,680
What, are you not happy?

282
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,160
Happy?

283
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,240
Are you crazy?

284
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,080
Surely you're not gonna
go through with this?

285
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,280
It could destroy us all.

286
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,200
Danny, we... We?!

287
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,840
Evie, there is no "we".

288
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,640
I love Becks.

289
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,960
I love my wife.

290
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,280
And I'm gonna go home to her.

291
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,360
OK.

292
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,560
But it's not only
you and Becka any more.

293
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,280
I guess I'll see you soon, then.

294
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,280
Hi. Hi, Jean.

295
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,120
I'm really sorry to bother you
so late,

296
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,520
but I was a little bit concerned
about the message you left,

297
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,000
saying Alan is not
the man I think he is.

298
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,760
Yeah, I can imagine.
And, I just thought, you know,

299
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,560
maybe we could discuss it?

300
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,640
OK.

301
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,280
Yeah. Look,
I'm sorry to tell you this,

302
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,680
but your husband
has been spying on me.

303
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:44,600
I've just come to realise
that for myself.

304
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,160
Did you know that he's stolen
a private video of ours?

305
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,320
I guessed as much.

306
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,000
What, you knew?

307
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,280
Do you know how he got that?

308
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,400
By breaking into our house.

309
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,120
Now, you told me
that there was an intruder.

310
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,200
So, you've been lying to me,
and it was him all along.

311
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,040
Do you know what he did
with that video?

312
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,320
No.

313
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,760
Jean, he posted it online

314
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,520
to try and shame and humiliate me

315
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,160
and I lost every client that I had.

316
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,520
Oh, my God.

317
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,480
Oh, my God, why would he
do such a thing to you?

318
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,160
If there's anything
I can do to help...

319
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,200
I would just be worried about
being married to a man like that.

320
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,560
He just disgusts me, you know?

321
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,320
My marriage has been over for years.

322
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,560
I've never been
able to admit it, though.

323
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,480
I should never have lied to you.

325
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,320
Sorry.

326
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:52,680
Sorry. Erm, Becka,
I was just thinking,

327
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,680
I've got...a group of friends
who do yoga every week

328
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,760
and their teacher
is on maternity leave.

329
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,360
You know, maybe you could step in?

331
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,480
Hey, babe.

How you doing?

333
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,640
Yeah.

334
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,680
I love you.

335
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,960
Do you?

336
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,240
Of course.

337
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:16,120
I'm... going up to bed.

338
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,760
OK.

339
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,640
Becks, I... I'll be up in a bit.

340
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,760
Here you go.

341
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,280
I wonder what you'd do
if I wasn't here.

342
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,040
I'm...sorry.

343
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,840
Oh, I bet you are,

344
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,680
but I'm not sure I can forgive you.

345
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,040
I don't know if
I want to even be with you.

346
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,200
I need time to think.

Oh, hello, love.

I was just passing

happy to fill you in, Alan.

in that locker!

362
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,760
Are you working for Robbie Spencer?

363
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,240
Jesus Christ. Keep it down!

364
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,880
If you want to talk to me,
don't shout at me in the street.

365
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,080
I'm on the verge of the story
of my crappy little career,

366
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,000
and we both know you're involved.
Come on, mate.

367
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:04,040
I'm not your mate. You think you're
such a fucking big man, don't you?

368
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,840
You give me one
piece of hard evidence

369
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,640
that links Robbie Spencer
to those stolen goods,

370
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,720
or I'll call your superiors
at the station right now

371
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,800
and tell them everything.

372
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,000
There's no need for empty threats.

373
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:15,480
These threats aren't empty.
I will fuck you.

374
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,000
Hmm? So, give me what I want, now!

375
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,480
OK, OK. Just just give me
till the end of day

376
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,640
and I'll get you something.
Why the wait?

377
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,040
Just believe me.

378
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,760
You'll get your story.

379
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,400
If it's not in my inbox by three,
I'm calling your boss.

382
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,040
Where did you get van and gear?

383
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,840
Do you want to know?
Not really, no.

384
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,920
Right.

385
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,680
Let's go over this one more time.
What's the password?

386
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,600
RentalG157unit@.

387
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,280
Yeah, all right. And the code?

388
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,960
One-six-six-eight-nine.

389
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,640
Got the key, haven't you?

390
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,320
Course. All right,

391
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,960
the scheduled van's only gonna
be about 15 minutes behind us,

392
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,560
mate, so you cannot hang about.

393
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,200
I'm aware of the plan, mate.

394
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,760
Let's go.

395
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,920
Is your phone on vibrate?

396
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,120
Yeah.

397
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,640
If I call you, it means you've got
to get the fuck out of dodge.

398
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,040
Immediately.

399
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,560
I got it.

400
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,440
Who are you?
What happened to Laurence?

401
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,840
He's off sick.

402
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,960
Hmm.

403
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,920
You're early.

404
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,560
Traffic was better than usual.

405
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,160
Code?

406
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,160
One-six-six-eight-nine.

407
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,440
This way.

408
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,360
Boss, I've just got
a security alert from the bank.

409
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,880
Someone's accessing the box.

410
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,840
What? How the fuck?

411
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,640
Fuck. Let's go.

412
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,080
Thanks for seeing me again.

413
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,200
Have you got your head
around it yet?

414
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,120
Getting there.

415
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,560
I'm fucking fuming, to be honest.

416
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,040
Not with you, sorry.

417
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,560
No, God, don't apologise.
You have every right to be.

418
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,120
He should have told me
a very long time ago.

419
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,680
To be fair,

420
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,040
we weren't in touch
until very recently.

421
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,440
And it was me who contacted him.

422
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:19,000
I just felt that Ethan needed
a relationship with his dad.

423
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:23,000
And...we needed the support.

424
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,280
That doesn't excuse
his secrecy though.

425
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,360
He knew he had a son.

426
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,520
Just sticks his head in the sand
though, doesn't he?

427
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,920
Yeah, yeah. He really does.

428
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,440
You've not said anything to him yet?

429
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,640
I wasn't ready, and I'd like
us to decide what to do next.

430
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,360
Well, Ethan's just next door.

431
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,080
Your key?

432
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,280
Oh, shit.

438
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,360
What do you want? Sorry...

439
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,640
You just can't park there.

440
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,520
Mate, go!

441
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,840
Just go!

442
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,760
Oi!

443
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,840

Ethan, this is Becka.

447
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,600
She's your dad's wife.

448
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,400
Hi, Ethan.

449
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,080
Becka has something
quite important to tell you.

450
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,960
I have a son whose name is Ollie.

451
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,040
And he's a little bit
younger than you.

452
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,400
He's your half-brother.

453
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,240
Would you like to meet him?

454
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,880
Yeah?

00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,280
I didn't think you guys
had it in you.

460
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,240
Nice one.

461
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,840
What happened to Gary?

462
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,280
Don't know.

463
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,160
But if something's
happened to him...

464
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,960
That's his problem.

Yeah. You earned it.

480
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,360
You don't sound too excited though.

481
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,560
Oh, I am, yeah.

482
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,920

Oh, I... I was totally out of order.

486
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:15,320
You mean a lot to me,
and I...acted like a prick.

487
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,440
No, no, it wasn't... It wasn't.
You..

488
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,280
You weren't. I, um...

489
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,800
I wanted it as much as you did.

490
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:28,320
I just think maybe we're better off
as colleagues, you know?

00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,880
