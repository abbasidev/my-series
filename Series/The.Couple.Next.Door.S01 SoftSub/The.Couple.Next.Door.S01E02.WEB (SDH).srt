1
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,840
EVIE BREATHES HEAVILY

2
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,800
THEY BREATHE DEEPLY

3
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,440
Morning.

4
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,880
Are you OK?

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,560
Cup of tea?

6
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,480
Ah!

7
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,480
You two were spotted by a colleague
riding your bikes

8
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,880
when you weren't on a shift.

9
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,520
And what were you doing in Holbeck?
Don't bullshit me.

10
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,200
On a job, ma'am. Just heading back.

11
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,480
In the complete opposite direction
to the station?

12
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,240
No, we were actually heading

13
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,160
to South Leeds station, ma'am,

14
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,360
on a social,

15
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,800
and we were just running a bit late.

16
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,080
Oh. Cos your colleague thought
you were in convoy.

17
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,920
Convoy? No.

18
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,640
Police bikes are the property

19
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,880
of this unit.

20
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,200
They're not used

21
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,800
for you to ride about town

22
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,360
like a couple of
pissy little new recruits,

23
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,800
ferrying you to random social events

24
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,160
when you're off duty.

25
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,640
Of course, ma'am. I expect better.

26
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,040
It won't happen again, ma'am.

27
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,160
No, it won't,

28
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,000
or you'll be facing a disciplinary.

29
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,080
Got it? Yes, ma'am.

30
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,120
Got away with that, mate!

31
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,920
We could have been caught,
you prick!

32
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,080
Yeah, all right! Keep your hair on!

33
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,960
I guess that means you're out, then.

34
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,560
Got that right.

35
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,840
That's a shame.

36
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,600
Good money to be made - for anyone
with the balls to do it.

37
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,800
SHE SIGHS

38
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,920
Miss, did you see me
do a handstand?

39
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,960
I did, Molly. You were amazing!

40
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,920
Miss, are you sad about your baby?

41
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,920
A little bit. Yeah.

42
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,160
Me, too.

43
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,680
Maybe you could have another one.

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,480
Yeah, maybe.

45
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,200
They're really cut up about it.

46
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,520
And they sent you
as celestial messenger.

47
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,520
You know they're not good
at this kind of thing,

48
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,280
but...they're hurting, Evie.

49
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,400
Bloody hell, Rach!
Do you think I'm not?

50
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,120
I am done with this judgment!

51
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,440
I am done with this love that comes
with conditions attached!

52
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,360
If they want to patch things up
with me, they can do it themselves.

53
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,680
Hi! Hi, gorgeous!
Hiya, love! You all right?

54
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,160
Nice to see you! You, too!

55
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,080
This is my sister Rachel.
This is Becka. Hello!

56
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,400
It's lovely to meet you!

57
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,280
Sorry, I'm probably quite sweaty. I
was just taking the girls for a run.

58
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,760
Can I tell you what a joy it is
to have your sister on the street?

59
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,320
She's an absolute babe!

60
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,600
I have to go, though.

61
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,040
Oh, yeah. Catch them up!

62
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,800
Wow!

63
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,320
"Absolute babe!"

64
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,640
Who was that?

65
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,720
It's my neighbour. She's great.

66
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,880
Really?

67
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,480
She doesn't seem your type.

68
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,600
You are just like them, aren't you?

69
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,240
You are so judgmental!

70
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,080
I didn't mean it like that, Evie.
I was...

71
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,880
Becka has been more of a support
to me than any of you lot.

72
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,360
I'm really sorry.

73
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,840
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,200
Come on. Let's head back.

75
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,000
Can we not do this on the doorstep?

76
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,840
You can pay me direct debit
if you like,

77
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,120
but then you'd have
to tell your missus.

78
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,360
Can I come in?

79
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,240
One step at a time.

80
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,680
I need to know I can rely on you,

81
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,480
and...I need more than this.

82
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm doing my best, Lena.

83
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,960
It's no reason to not let me in.
No, I'm not. No. Not yet.

84
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,320
DOOR LOCK CLUNKS

85
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,960
Let's not part on bad terms.

86
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,040
No, I really don't want to.

87
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,320
Come here!

88
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,000
It'll be OK.

89
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,720
It's not that. It's not...

90
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,680
I need to tell you something,
and I'm...I'm dreading it.

91
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,120
What is it?

92
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,120
Rachel, just tell me
what's going on.

93
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,600
I'm pregnant.

94
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,080
WHISPERS: What?

95
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,280
That's amazing news!

96
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,520
I was so worried about telling you.

97
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,560
Don't be silly!

98
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,640
That is the best news ever!

99
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,600
I'm so happy for you both!

100
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,640
RACHEL SOBS

101
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,480
How far along are you?

102
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,400
Just over three months.

103
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,080
We wanted to wait
till we'd had the scans,

104
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,560
just to make sure that
everything was OK.

105
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,240
And it will be.

106
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,600
It will be.

107
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,040
Thank you!

108
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,240
A baby is always a blessing.

109
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,880
You are both blessed.

110
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,680
God! I'm good! Hmm?

111
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,920
Check this out.

112
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,560
What am I looking at?

113
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,080
This company -
Colossus Building Supplies.

114
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,480
Registered to an Eddie Smallwood,

115
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,360
also a co-director
of Robbie Spencer's parent company.

116
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,800
Head office is here in Leeds.

117
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,440
Er, so...?

118
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,320
So...Eddie Smallwood...

119
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,040
..doesn't exist.

120
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,120
Or if he does, he's hiding.

121
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,000
No Facebook profile,
no internet presence,

122
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,480
no bank records, no home address.

123
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,520
Mm.

124
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,560
Oh! Nice!

125
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,800
Nice!

126
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,040
What...?

127
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,240
OK, why would Spencer have
a co-director who doesn't exist?

128
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,920
Well, why don't we take a look

129
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,840
at the mythical Mr Smallwood's
head office and find out?

130
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,560
Oh, look at you, Sherlock Holmes!

131
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,280
All right. If you don't want to be
my Watson, I'll find someone else.

132
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,560
Oh!

133
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,040
Wait, wait! Are we...?

134
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,480
What? Are we going now?

135
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,560
VEHICLE APPROACHES

136
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,400
Afternoon, Alan.

137
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,600
Gloria.

138
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,920
Say good afternoon, Mr Snuffles.

139
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,160
DOG YAPS

140
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,880
I don't think they're in.

141
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,160
DOORBELL RINGS

142
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,360
Hey! Hey.

143
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,000
Yeah, we were just wondering
if you're free tomorrow, but...

144
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,280
Are you OK?

145
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,880
Yeah, yeah. Come in.

146
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,800
So, Olly's on sleepover tomorrow

147
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,560
and the forecast is good,

148
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,240
so we're thinking of going to the
seaside, if you fancy joining us.

149
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,960
Wow! Um...

150
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,360
Yeah.
Yeah, that...that sounds lovely.

151
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,320
You feeling all right?

152
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,360
Yeah, I'm fine.

153
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,840
Do you ever feel like you just don't
know who you are any more?

154
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,160
Like you're driving into the
darkness and you just can't stop?

155
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,680
Sorry! Sorry.

156
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,080
You must think I'm crazy.

157
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,360
No.

158
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,840
No, actually, I really get it.

159
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,880
Do you?

160
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,880
God! You've no idea!

161
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,320
Every day I do...

162
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,160
..I do something
I don't understand.

163
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,920
Evie, you'd be crazy
if you didn't feel like that

164
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,920
after what you've been through.

165
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,880
Well, what do you do
when that feeling comes up?

166
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,040
I bury it,

167
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,280
ignore it, hope it goes away.

168
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,520
But Pete - I mean,
he likes to talk about things...

169
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,040
Oh. ..get things out in the air,
and I just don't.

170
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:29,160
I am a firm believer
in the power of bottling things up!

171
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,640
Bury it deep
and get on with your life.

172
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,040
Thank you.

173
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,680
And yes to tomorrow.

174
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,480
It sounds lovely.

175
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,840
Yeah.

176
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,320
Well...

177
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,240
..I'd better get going.

178
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,520
Yeah.

179
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,760
Why don't we do something nice
this weekend?

180
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,400
TV ON QUIETLY

181
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,760
I said we'd go to the coast
with the neighbours.

182
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,880
They're very keen.

183
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,280
We said we wanted to make friends,
babe, and we have.

184
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,120
All right.

185
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,240
I saw Rach.

186
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,560
Cool.

187
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,920
She's pregnant.

188
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,000
Oh, Evie... Isn't that lovely news?

189
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,360
Babe, are you OK about that?

190
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,520
Yeah.

191
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,440
But... But nothing.

192
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,000
We should be very happy for them.

193
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,760
What the hell? Wow!

194
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,880
Borrowed it from a friend.

195
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,680
Yeah, it's nice. Check it out.

196
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,240
Wow! Yeah. Good? It's amazing!

197
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,520
What have we got there?
Travelling in style.

198
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,760
MUSIC: All We Strive For
by Speedometer

199
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,520
# Hold your breath and hope for more

200
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,800
# But if you find it

201
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,280
# Oh

202
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,000
# It's all we strive for

203
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,280
# Ooh, we strive, we strive

204
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,760
# Alive for

205
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,280

# We fight for

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,680
# Cos every little chance we get

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,960
# We got to try... #

211
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,960
I really like it here. Yeah.

212
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,560
It's weird that you picked this spot.

213
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,600
It's the exact spot I used
to come with my parents.

214
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,000
Oh.

215
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,360
Yeah.

216
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,960
Happy memories?

217
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,200
EVIE LAUGHS

218
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,640
OK.

219
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,720
Let's go and have some wine.

220
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,480
You know, this was my dad's
only concession to a holiday,

221
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,880
and he hated every second of it.

222
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,800
Honestly, he would sit
on a deckchair over there

223
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,840
and he would count the minutes
till he could go home to the farm.

224
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,920
Did he not ever play with you?

225
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,520
Goodness, no. Thank you.

226
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,880
Little kids - far too full of sin.

227
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,560
Oh, yeah, we were never doing what
we were told. Always being naughty.

228
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,320
No offence but...

229
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,680
..your old man sounds like
a right piece of work.

230
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,840
Yeah, he is. No fun in my childhood.

231
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,840
But I am trying
to make up for that now.

232
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,120
EVIE CHUCKLES
Good. Hey, we do all right.

233
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,040
Ah, we do.
And it's all this one's fault.

234
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,560
Yeah, so there was I,
a fresher at uni,

235
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:03,360
desperate to escape the church,
and into these sinful arms I fell.

236
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,160
Sorry, not sorry.
EVIE LAUGHS

237
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,680
Anyone?

238
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,320
Oh, go on, Pete. Go on.

239
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,440
Come on.
EVIE LAUGHS

240
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,560
Game on. Oh, Pete!

241
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,360
Oh, come on.

242
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,000
Oh, here we go.

243
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,680
Come on. Yeah.

244
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,040
Now we're talking.

245
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,280
Ooh, he caught it. Not bad.
Thought I couldn't catch?

246
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,000
Oh, yeah, what about that?

247
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,160
EVIE LAUGHS
You think this is for our benefit?

248
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,840
I am afraid it might be. Mm-hm.

249
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,200
Ready?

250
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,560
Aargh. Oh!

251
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,920
Yes!

252
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,400
Fuck.

253
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,880
Why are men such show-offs?

254
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,680
Well, there's an evolutionary theory.

255
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,000
Ah? Yeah.
Yeah, it's so that the, uh,

256
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,400
the female of the species,
they notice them

257
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,640
and they can't resist
their masculine prowess.

258
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,720
Right.
EVIE LAUGHS

259
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,920
Oh. On the head!

260
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,360
Oh! Ah! Fuck!

261
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,320
CAMERA CLICKING

262
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,840
HEAVY BREATHING AND MOANING

263
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,840
CAMERA CLICKING

264
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,240
MOANING CONTINUES

265
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,200
Yes! I knew there was another one.

266
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,600
All right, here you go. Oh!
BECKA LAUGHS

267
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,400
So, Evie... Mm-hm?

268
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,320
Was Pete your only boyfriend?

269
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,600
EVIE LAUGHS

270
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,800
Yes, my... He was my...
my only serious one.

271
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,520
Only sexual one...
Pete! ..she means.

272
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,680
You must think I'm such a saddo.

273
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,480
No, I think it's admirable -
you knew exactly what you wanted.

274
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,120
What about you two?

275
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,640
Well... Um...

276
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,440
I was in a relationship when we met.

277
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,040
Ooh. That's awkward.

278
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,000
Well, it was and it wasn't.

279
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,080
It was a non-monogamous
relationship.

280
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,520
And...how did that work?

281
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,960
Sorry if, uh...
I mean, I'm just curious, so...

282
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,440
Well, we, dated each other,

283
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,760
but we also saw other people,

284
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,600
as long as we were clear
on the boundaries.

285
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,200
And did it work?

286
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,080
It did.

287
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,640
Until Danny. Um...

288
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,920
I think my ex realised that he was
more possessive than he thought,

289
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,360
and he asked me to choose,
and I did.

290
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,200
And how did you feel
about that set-up?

291
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,200
Pete, will you stop being
so flipping nosy?

292
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,720
No, don't be daft. It's fine.

293
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,000
I'm glad you're interested.
What do you want to know?

294
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,600
Well, what did it...?
What did it feel like

295
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,440
being with someone who...
who didn't want to be monogamous?

296
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,440
Confusing at first, but...

297
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,960
..then I spent more time with Becks
and got my head around it and...

298
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,360
..realised we'd both
be much happier.

299
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,520
Now, here we are,

300
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,480
still happily non-monogamous.

301
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,000
Wow.

302
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,680
You still just date
whoever you want?

303
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,880
No, we realised that dating
other people wasn't for us.

304
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,880
Mm-hm. In Becka's fantasy world,

305
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,960
everyone would be able
to date whoever they like,

306
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,840
whenever they like,
without consequence.

307
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,800
BOTH LAUGH
Yeah.

308
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,440
Yeah, right.

309
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,480
And, look, to answer your question,

310
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,640
for us, well, we're allowed to
play with other people

311
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,560
as long as we're both present.

312
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:38,960
And is that cos you think
monogamy is a...false construct?

313
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,440
It just... It just didn't work
for us.

314
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,240
I would never judge
anybody's choices.

315
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,680
Doesn't stop them judging us, sadly.

316
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,880
Oh, I hope... I hope you don't
think we're... Yeah.

317
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,360
..judging you. We... I mean,
we don't have to talk about it.

318
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,800
No, not at all. I mean,
I really like talking about it.

319
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,920
I think...

320
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,640
I think it can be
a really healthy way to live.

321
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:01,120
I mean, our neighbours
might not think so.

322
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,400
They're... They're really
lovely people. Oh.

323
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,840
No, I get it. They're nosy buggers.

324
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,360
Every time I go out, I feel like
they're twitching their curtains.

325
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,640
Right? Oh, my God, I thought
it was just me being paranoid.

326
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,760
It's like I can never escape them.

327
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,840
And now the guy at number 37
has started taking my yoga classes.

328
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,280
Did he now? Mm-mm.

329
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,600
Look, it's...

330
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,960
It's an OK place to live.
I'm not saying that it isn't.

331
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,760
Well, we promise not
to twitch our curtains at you.

332
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,240
Oh, darling,
you can twitch all you like.

333
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,440
Ah, now, she probably means that.
EVIE LAUGHS

334
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,120
Am I right? I do.

335
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,960
Yeah, she does. I knew it!

336
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,640
Let's say we smoke this,

337
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,600
go back to t'camper van,
get the party started?

338
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,400
This day is getting better
by the minute.

339
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,120
Isn't it, Pete? Yeah.

340
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,520
Oh! Mmm.

341
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,000
HEAVY BREATHING AND MOANING

342
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,080
JEAN: Alan?
HE STOPS VIDEO

343
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,760
What would you like
for lunch, love?

344
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,280
I don't mind.

345
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,440
OK, well, it won't be long.

346
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,760
I'll be down in a minute.

347
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,440
Thanks for waiting.
Yes, that date is available.

348
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,400
We'll send an engineer
to assess the property

349
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,880
before we install the stairlift.

350
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,960
Oh, that sounds wonderful.

351
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,320
Thanks. Let's get that booked in,
shall we?

352
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,440
Of course. Will do now.
See you then.

353
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,240
Come on, then, darling.

354
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,920
That's gone straight to my head.

355
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,800
I feel like we're hanging out
with two horny teenagers.

356
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,320
We are.
EVIE LAUGHS

357

That's what's crazy -

473

thought about it.

We've never even talked about it
in all these years.

questioning it.

500
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,400
Could be dangerous. In what way?

501
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,080
It could get messy with friends.

502
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,280

for a bit of danger.

00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,720

I'm not jeopardising anything.

507
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,120
No, the rules are there
for a reason.

508
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,560
They work, so...

509
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,400

and stay fit?

532
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,640
Is that a crime?

533
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,880
This is a free country

534
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,120

I want.

535
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,880
Is that right?

536
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,360
Fucking creep.

537
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,000
MOTORBIKE DRIVES AWAY

538
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,640
SOPHIE: Well, at least they're open
this time.

539
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,920
Only two reasons you run
a business under a fake name.

540
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:21,320
Mm-hm. You're either creaming off
the profits

541
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,400
or you're money laundering.

542
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,680
Exactly. Mm-hm.

543
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,040
What is with the security, though?

544
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,320
And armed.

545
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,320
Like that's legal.

546
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,440
It's a timberyard, not a bank.

547
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,720
Exactly.

548
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,920
Uh, random question.

549
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,440
Yeah?

550
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,960
You know anyone
in an open relationship?

551
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,600
Um...

552
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,520
..yeah.

553
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,560
Yeah, loads of my mates, actually,
um...

554
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,440
In fact, three of them
are in a throuple.

555
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,680
Meaning?

556
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,640
What do you mean, meaning?

557
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,880
Meaning there's three
of them, not two, Grandad.

558
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,600
And how does that work?

559
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,200
I don't bloody know,
but apparently it does, so...

560
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,680
Not your vibe?

561
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,960
Sorry. That was, um...

562
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,760
That was very personal.

563
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,320
No. What? No, it's...

564
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,720
Look, I'm... I'm bi, but I'm also
an old-fashioned saddo

565
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,840
who only has room in her heart
for one person at a time.

566
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,800
There you go. That's just me.

567
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,920
I didn't know you were, um...

568
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,960
I mean, it's... It's cool.

569
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,600
Obviously. Um...

570
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,320
SHE LAUGHS UNCOMFORTABLY
OK. Well, um...

571
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,280
..thank you for the blessing,
boomer,

572
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:50,080
I feel really sexually validated
right now.

573
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,200
Bloody hell. That's Spencer.

574
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,680
Are those guys cops?

575
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,080
CAMERA CLICKING

576
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,960
CAMERA CLICKING

577
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,320
I think we should drive on.

578
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,280
Where'd you get these from, then?

579
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,360
One of Robbie's lot sorted 'em...
Ah.

580
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,600
Look, fake number plates, the lot.

581
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,640
Oh.

582
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,560
Christ.

583
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,000
Think of the money.

584
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,200
Five grand each.
We'll be home in no time.

585
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:32,680
Come on, admit it.
Like clockwork, right?

586
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,480
Yeah, I told you - stay sharp.

587
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,480
Get back in position.

588
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:42,040
OK, all right, all right.
Keep your pants on.

589
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,240
Heads-up.

590
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,360
There's a vehicle on
the wrong side of the road.

591
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,600
I'm gonna check it out.

592
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,960
Yeah, copy that, mate. Eyes on.

593
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,000
Fuck. Fuck!

594
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,320
DANNY GROANS

595
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,280
SMOKE GUN FIRES

596
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:39,360
GUNSHOTS

597
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,120
Clear.

598
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,440
Clear.

599
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,320
PETE: Evie?
