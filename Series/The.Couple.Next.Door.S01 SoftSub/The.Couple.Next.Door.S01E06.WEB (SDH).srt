Have I got it right?

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,200
S, that's it.

00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,880
I can't believe I've got a brother.

Hi, Ethan, how are you?

9
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,200
How did you...
I followed you, Danny.

10
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,080
I had to.

11
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,960
I... I don't trust you any more.

12
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,640
I'm so incredibly sorry.

13
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,960
I am so angry.

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,200
But worse than that,
I feel completely betrayed.

15
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,040

No, don't, don't.

Oh, morning, love.
Morning.

18
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,240
Would you like some eggs?

19
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,960
No, I'm good. Oh. Well, I'm making
some for your father. So...

20
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
No. I'm just going to have some
toast, actually. All right.

21
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,360
It's a lovely surprise,
having you come and stay with us.

22
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,040
Even if it is a bit out of
the blue.

23
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,880
I hope I'm not imposing.
Not a bit of it.

24
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,000
No, we're just delighted
for you both.

25
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,200
We've been praying for you.

26
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,240
We knew you'd succeed.

27
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,360
The lord finds a way.

28
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,600
He does.

29
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,080
I was wondering if I could go and
spend a couple of days

30
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,880
at our cottage?
Why would you want to do that?

31
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,920
I could just do with
a bit of time, to be honest.

32
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,560
Just to think about everything
that's happened.

33
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,880
You know, process it.

34
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,120
Have you not got any work?

35
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,520
Well, it's the first day of
the summer holidays, isn't it?

36
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,920
Oh, that's come round quickly.
Yeah.

37
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,160
Well, if that's what you want,
of course you can stay there.

38
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,880
I'll take you down
and we can get it set up.

39
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,560
Is, erm...
is everything OK at home?

40
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,120
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's just...

41
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,320
..it's just a lot,
isn't it?

42
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,960
I know you'll really like him, Mum.

No comment.

51
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,080
Don't play daft.
That's where we arrested you.

52
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,480
Do you want to tell us why you
were outside a bank,

53
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,120
impersonating a security officer

No comment.

55
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,240
And who was the other man that was
with you? The one that got away?

57
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,040
I want to mention another
incident, Gary.

58
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,080
There was an accident, just off
the M62, involving a van and a car.

59
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,840
The van was being escorted

60
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,040
by what looked like off-duty
police officers.

61
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,640
I wonder if all these things might
be connected.

When was Danny Whitwell's
last shift?

63
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,040
Yesterday, but he was off sick.

64
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,440
I need to speak to Whitwell,
to eliminate him from my enquiries.

65
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,040
Right, OK,
leave it with me two minutes.

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,000
Actually, do you know what?
Don't even bother.

73
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,480
You're not going to tell me
the truth anyway.

not about where our money's gone.

I was talking to Lena,

trying to piece it all together.

77
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,480
And she told me that Ethan is only
15 months older than Ollie.

78
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,440
Oh, no, no, no.
I never cheated on you. I swear.

79
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,200
It was before we met.
It was just a fling.

I was terrified I'd get in trouble

Yeah, she mentioned that as well.

82
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,400
I can understand making mistakes,
you know,

83
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,960
even mistakes as big as this one.

84
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,280
But what I can't understand is why
you would abandon him.

it's like they're old friends.

We always begged you,

No, that can't be right, that. I
remem... No, you'd let us stay for

a few hours and then you'd always
march us home to bed.

148

00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,320
and that IVF is a sin,

178
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,440
and that I'd go
to hell if I used it.

179
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,200
How do you think that made me feel?

180
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,440
When I lost my baby,

181
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,400
it felt like you'd cursed me.

182
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,240
Like you'd prayed for her
to be gone.

183
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,320
You wanted me to have
a baby naturally,

184
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,520
so I had natural, unprotected sex
with another man.

185
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,320
A man that I am in love with.

186
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,280
And now I'm carrying his child.

187
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,720
Isn't that what you wanted?

188
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,480
What are you talking about?

189
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,480
If Pete comes looking
for me don't tell him where I am.

190
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,120
I just need a bit of me time.

191
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,240
Becks.

192
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,840
I should have brought
Ethan round before.

193
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,600
I was too scared.

194
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,080
I know that was wrong.

195
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,560
I'm so sorry.

200
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,280
Hi.

201
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,440
Danny, I've told my dad that
the baby is yours

202
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,240
and he's gone mad. He's really
threatening me and I'm so scared.

203
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,600
Well, where are you?

204
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,240
I'm in the cottage on my
parents' land.

205
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,960
In the field behind the farmhouse.
He's trapped me here.

206
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,400
Evie, I can't.
Please, please come.

207
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,640
What is it? You have to come and
help me. I'll send you the location.

208
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,760
No, Evie... Evie!

209
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,520
What's going on. I don't know.
But I think she's in trouble.

210
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,920
What?

211
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,120
Will you come with me? Why?

212
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,920
I'll explain everything.
Just come. Please.

213
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,160
Olly? Yeah?

214
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,280
Will you go Viraj's place for
a little bit?

215
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,040
OK, Mum.

216
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,480
Oi! Oi!

217
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,080
Fuck off.
It's got fuck all to do with you.

218
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,520
You reckon?
Who'd you think my source was, hey?

219
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,280
You're going to have to learn to
cope on your own, Alan.

220
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,760
I'm leaving.

221
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,520
What... what are you talking about?

222
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,720
On top of everything else that
you've done,

223
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,960
I found a bank statement from our
savings account up in your office.

224
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,320
You've been lying to me for years
about our financial situation.

225
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,600
I don't know why it
surprises me.

226
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,040
Anyway, I've taken half the money.
That's my share.

227
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,920
I think that's fair, don't you?

228
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,360
Enough to help me start
a life without you.

229
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,600
And the rest will pay
for your care.

230
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,680
Wh–wh–wh–what's happening?

231
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,920
I gave you the best years
of my life.

232
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,960
And all you've done is throw them
back in my face.

233
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,400
Did you honestly think you could
come back from all of this?

234
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,000
Hey? Oh, and by the way,
when you're well enough,

235
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,160
the police are going to
want to have a chat with you.

236
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,320
Actions have consequences, Alan.

237
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,240
Oh, hello.
Mrs Richardson?

238
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,040
Yes, that's me. Come in.
That's Alan in there.

239
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,200
Hello, Alan, my name's Reena,
this is Max.

240
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,520
Say hello to your carers, Alan.

241
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,880
So, how are we doing today?

242
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,200
Are you going to tell me why we're
driving to Evie's parents'?

243
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,000
Because she's scared.

244
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,680
Of what?

245
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,520
Her dad.

246
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,240
Why?

247
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,000
It's complicated.
No, no, don't do that.

248
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:03,280
Don't give me that shit.
Why did she ring you?

249
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,840
Because she needs help.

250
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,880
Why do I feel like every word that
you're saying to me is bullshit?

251
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,120
You're lying right now.

252
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,240
Come on, Danny, you said that you
would tell me everything.

253
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,880
Evie's pregnant.

254
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,120
It's mine.

255
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,840
Pull over.

256
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,600
Pull over.

257
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,880
Becks... Becks, wait!

258
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,920
Becka, wait.

259
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,840
Christ. Becka!

260
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,320
Becka, for Christ's sake,
come back.

261
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,160
Becka?

262
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,560
How long have you known?

263
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,200
And don't tell me that you didn't
know how to tell me.

264
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,280
I bet you fucking didn't.

265
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,600
It was an accident, obviously.

266
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,680
You had sex with her without
a condom.

267
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,880
No, I didn't.

268
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,880
The condom split.

269
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,680
And she said she was on the Pill.

270
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,800
Yeah, this relationship, it...

271
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,000
It used to be built on
honesty.

272
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:48,000
But it's just lie after lie.

273
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:55,120
Danny, if we have any kind
of future together it has to stop.

274
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,160
It has to stop right now.

275
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:03,040
I need you to tell me everything
before we get back in the car.

276
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,200
It's that bad, is it?

277
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,400
Well, whatever's happened, we have
to face it.

278
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,440
Even if it kills us.

279
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,760
I had sex with her again.

280
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,160
Where?

281
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,520
At work.

282
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,000
She came to me.
She was very insistent.

283
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,720
No, don't do that.
Don't put this on Evie.

284
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,040
I'm not, but...

285
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,720
I shouldn't have done it,
but she's not in a good place.

286
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,200
She's obsessed with me.

287
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,200
I just asked you not
to put this on her

288
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,840
and you're doing it again.
Can you see that?

289
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,840
Look, I accept that
I am also responsible.

290
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,920
I was reckless, and I didn't see
that she was so vulnerable.

291
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,920
But Danny, you did,
and still, you fucked her again.

292
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:24,440
Presumably making her infinitely
more confused.

293
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,800
I can't stop fucking up, Becks.

294
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,240
I try and I try, and I just can't.

295
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,080
Well, maybe you're not trying
hard enough.

296
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,040
I have never been good enough
for you.

297
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:55,480
That is absolute bullshit.

298
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:00,040
I... I have worshipped you from
the day I met you.

299
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,840
I still do. And you,
you just, you just can't see that.

300
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,560
And so, you fuck up,

301
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,480
over and over so you can say that
it's your fault

302
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,720
and you hate yourself.

303
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,880
And you get stuck in this
pathetic cycle.

304
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,320
Can you see a way back?

305
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,200
I mean...

306
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,160
..can you?

307
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,840
We need to get to Evie.

308
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,680
Well, I never.

00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,840

Yes, I am. A very long one.

315
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,200
Hi, could I just have
a moment of your time, please, Sir?

316
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,200
Uh, yeah, yeah,

317
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,040
I was just looking
for my neighbour.

318
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,400
He doesn't appear to be home.

319
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,560
Do you know where Mr Whitwell
might be?

320
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,720
No.

321
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,080
When did you last see him, Sir?

322
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,120
Yesterday.

323
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,160
And do you know him well?

324
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,720
I guess so.

325
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,560
What's your name, sir?

326
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,040
Pete Thomas, I live just,
uh, just here.

327

Right, well,

328
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,400
if you do see him just let him know
we'll be in touch.

329
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,640
Will do, yeah, thank you.

330

00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,480
Pete.

332
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,560
Are they looking for Danny?

333
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,080
Er, yeah.

334
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,240
Yeah, he left.

335
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,000
He drove off about half
an hour ago.

336
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,120
Thanks, Jean.

337
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,600
Where's Evie?

338
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,440
Uh, she's not here either.

Listen,
I know it's none of my business,

being taken for fools.

I do care about Becka. And I..

..you know, you do see things when
you live in a place like this.

343

I'm sorry,
I know it's none of my business.

344
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,800
No, no, I, uh...

345
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,520
I appreciate that, uh, Jean.

346
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,400
I'd rather know the truth.

347
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,000
It's been nice knowing you.

348
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,920
You take care of yourself.

349

Where do you want it, mate?

350
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,320
It says it's around here somewhere.

00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,440
Oh, there it is.

352
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,360
What now?

353
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,280
Check out what's going on.

354
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,960
Well, I'm coming.
No, no. We don't know the situation.

355
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,480
I'll suss it out.
It might be dangerous.

356
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,320
Evie?

357
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,880
I knew you'd come to the rescue.

358
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,800
Evie, what are you doing?

359
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,480
Come and join me.

360
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,480
You said you were in danger.

361
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,480
Oh, well, my dad was really angry.

362
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,680
And he could be back any minute.

363
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,120
What's going on?

364
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,040
We'll wait while you get dressed.

365
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,960
I know she's here.

366
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,960
Sorry, what's going on, Peter?

367
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,400
Look, you...you seem awfully upset.
Why don't you come and sit down?

368
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,160
I need to see her, Susan.

369
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,640
You go right ahead,
I won't stand in your way.

370
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:42,280
What she's done to you,
I will never forgive her.

371
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,080
Would somebody please tell me
what's going on?

372
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,480
It's not mine.

373
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,960
The baby.

374
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,680
Sh... She had sex with one
of our neighbours.

375
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,360
And she paraded that fact to me like
she were proud of it. Where is she?

376
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,880
In the cottage.

377
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,440
Brian.

378
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,160
You better see to matters, Peter.

379
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,720
I don't think that's a very
good idea. Tempers are frayed.

380
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,840
You bet tempers are frayed.

381
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,560
Move out of the way, Susan.

382
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,080
Oh, oh!

383
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,400
And you tell her never
to set foot in here ever again.

384
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,640
Lord...

385
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,800
..please turn 'em away
from darkness to light.

386
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,040
And the power of Satan to God

387
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,160
so that they may receive forgiveness
of sins.

388
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,080
And a place among those who are
sanctified by faith in you.

389
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,800
Amen. Amen.

390
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,360
Told you to stay in car.

391
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,080
Yeah, and look how dangerous it
turned out to be.

392
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,520
OK, you didn't know that.

393
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,560
Fuck's sake, Becks.

394
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,080
You always do this.

395
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,200
You just never think
anything's going to be dangerous.

396
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,280
You just walk right in,
thinking it'll all be fine.

397
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,360
Yeah, OK, Danny,
you've made your point.

398
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,680
No, we needed rules.

399
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,480
We always did, and you're
always breaking them!

400
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,560
Look, I should have been more honest
about Evie...

401
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,360
..and everything
that's been going on.

402
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,240
But...I shut down, I bottled it.

403
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,440
Yeah, I know you did.

404
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:38,920
I think we've both been...hiding
the way that we've been feeling.

405
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,400
I've been really unhappy.

406
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,600
I'm going to take control
of this whole mess.

407
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:59,800
Finally prove to you that
I can be a man worthy of you.

408
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,480
Even if it is too late.

409
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,520
But you've always been that man.

410
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,160
OK.

411
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,760
Evie...

412
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,720
Listen. I led you on badly.

413
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,400
That's all down to me, but...

414
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,160
..this is all to stop.

415
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,400
Does she know?

416
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,040
About the baby?

417
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,360
Yeah.

418
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:42,880
And whatever you want to do,
we will work it out. OK?

419
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,960
Evie, you and I are not together.

420
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,880
Right, so is that why
you fucked me again?

421
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:53,040
Evie, I know about that as well.

422
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,280
Look, Becka, I'm...
I'm really sorry that you got hurt,

423
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,000
but, I mean, it's...
He just couldn't help it.

424
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,520
It's how he feels about me.

425
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,680
Feels for you?

426
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:31,080
That's not how it happened!
I was weak, I was stupid.

427
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,280
Danny. The bond that we have
is special!

428
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,640
Bond? You can't stop this
from happening. Evie...

429
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,680
Let not steadfast love and
faithfulness forsake you

430
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,200
for I have, I have bound it
around my neck,

431
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,160
and I have written it on
the tablet of my heart.

432
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,360
Evie, stop!

433
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,880
Pete.

434
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,560
Get away from him.

435
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,120
Get away.

436
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:56,880
All right, everyone stay calm.

437
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,640
You ruined everything.

438
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,880
You stole her from me.

439
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,320
Now give me one reason
not to put a bullet in your head.

440
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,440
WOOD BEING CHOPPED

441
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,080
Brian? I've nowt to say.

442
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,040
That's our daughter.

443
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:26,200
Our own flesh and blood,
and she needs our help.

444
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,880
She'll get no help from me.

445
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,880
Look, if anyone does not know
how to manage his own family,

446
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,960
how can he take care of
God's church?

447
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I don't need lessons in scripture.

448
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,720
No, no, but you need lessons
in their meaning.

449
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,920
You're a hypocrite.

450
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,520
You twist the words of the Lord
for your own ends.

451
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,080
I won't be spoken to like that!
Well, you earn my respect,

452
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,040
and you go and help your own flesh
and blood in time of need!

453
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,960
Ever used a gun before?

454
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,640
The force of the kickback means you
don't know what you'll end up

455
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,240
shooting in a small space like this.

456
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,040
Come on, mate.

457
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,080
You know you're not going
to use this, huh?

458
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:33,240
Stop playing silly beggars.
Put it down.

459
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,440
Pete...

460
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,680
Pete, look,
we've all made mistakes.

461
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:41,640
Just, let's forgive
and we'll move on.

462
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,480
You need to look after yourself
and look after Evie.

463
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,400
She needs you right now.

464
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,960
Not if she's keeping that baby.

465
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,880
You don't get to tell me what to do.

466
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,120
Why don't you understand
that it's over?

467
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,480
I don't recognise you.

468
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,720
It was all fine
until he came along.

469
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,560
He made me feel things
that I have never felt with you.

470
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,040
Evie.

471
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:10,200
The Lord has granted
the desires of my heart.

472
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,240
I am having his baby and there
is nothing you can do about it.

473
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,400
Pete, I want you
to know I have no part of this.

474
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,120
I'm not trying to replace you
or come in between you in any way.

475
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,920
Bullshit! Bullshit!

476
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:25,800
From the moment we met,
you saw me as easy prey.

477
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:29,280
You belittled me. You sneered at me.

478
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,240
And then you stole Evie from me

479
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,560
and took her to bed,
right in front of my face!

480
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,600
I'm sorry you feel that way.

481
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,840
Fuck off.

482
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,640
You've every right to be angry.

483
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,560
But we are not going to be
together. Not ever.

484
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,640
I love Becks.

485
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,960
I want to be with her,
whether she wants me or not.

486
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,600
DOUBLE GUNSHOT

487
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,000
Pete, no!

488
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,080
GUNSHOT

489
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,280
Pete!

490
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,480
Danny...

491
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,720
Danny. Are you OK?

492
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,360
You have to stop him.

493
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,120
He's not thinking clearly!

494
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,040
Evie!

495
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,320
Evie!

496
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,040
Evie!

497
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,920
Evie!

498
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:49,160
SHE SOBS

499
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,680
Pete, please.

500
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,240
Pete!

501
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,640
Pete, stop.

502
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,160
Pull that trigger, you'll regret it
for the rest of your life.

503
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,480
Shut it!

504
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,480
Evie, please.

505
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,560
I've never loved anyone before you.

506
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,760
And I'll never love anyone
again, please.

507
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,520
You can't leave me.

508
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,840
You can't... Pete! Stop!

509
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,640
GUNSHOT
Argh!

510
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:50,520
Danny! No, no, no,
no, no. No, no, no.

511
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,840
Get out the way.

512
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,440
Stop. Pete, stop.

513
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,200
I have nothing against you. You're
not the one who took her from me!

514
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,240
For Christ's sake, Pete,
no-one took her from you.

515
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,960
Shut up! You hear me?
Shut the fuck up!

516
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,880
Pete.

517
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,960
I really loved you.

518
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,840
Do you still love me?

519
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,600
No.

520
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,280
GUNSHOT

521
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,960
Pete!

522
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
No!

523
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:11,000
SOBBING
No, Pete.

524
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,920
Pete.
