1
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,120
HE CHUCKLES SOFTLY
I want to do that again.

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,440
Oh, probably shouldn't
get too carried away.

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,840
It's hard not to, after that.

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,280
HE CHUCKLES
It is.

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,480
But...

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,960
..I need to go back to my partner,
and you yours.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,240
That's how this works, I'm afraid.

8
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,400
DOOR OPENS

9
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,160
Didn't go well?

10
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,480
Jesus, Danny,
I have been waiting for you.

11
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,440
Someone has found our photos,
and our video,

12
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,240
and they posted it online.

13
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,080
They're making me sound like
I'm some kind of sex worker,

14
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,400
touting for business.

15
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,640
What the hell?
There's a link on my social media

16
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,600
and everyone has seen it.

17
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,920
Did you send our video to anyone?
No. No, of course not.

18
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,800
Then how has someone found it?!

19
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,080
I don't know.

20
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,080
I'm going to find out...

21
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,600
..I promise.

22
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,400
I thought I saw an intruder
so I sent Alan around,

23
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,160
and then when he didn't come back,
I went to check.

24
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,400
We think he's had a stroke,
Mrs Richardson,

25
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,800
so we need to get him
to the hospital as soon as possible.

26
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,080
Yes, of course.

27
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,920
You can accompany him
in the ambulance, if you like. Yeah.

28
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,360
So, this isn't your house?

29
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,640
No. The owners are out of town,
but I'll contact them.

30
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,280
Pete.

31
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,600
HE CHUCKLES SOFTLY

32
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,360
Bye. Bye. See you later.

33
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,240
SHE SIGHS

34
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,960
CAR DOOR SHUTS

35
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,240
ENGINE STARTS

36
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,360
Look, why don't we do
something nice tonight?

37
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,760
Go to the pub, maybe?

38
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,600
You're just going to act
like everything's normal.

39
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,040
How else do you want me to act?

40
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,720
Pete, no-one died.

41
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:23,360
I get that it was a bit awkward,
but Becka don't mind.

42
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,240
Honestly, don't beat yourself up.

43
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,600
I'm going to clean out the shed.

44
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,800
OK, yeah.

45
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,400
Yeah, thanks for your help.

46
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,640
They can find the owner of the blog,
but it might take a while.

47
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,280
What, and in the meantime,
it just stays online?

48
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,360
Well, just delete the comment
with the link on it.

49
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,720
Well, obviously I've deleted
the comment, Danny.

50
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,400
Sorry. Sorry.

51
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,760
I know. I know, it's awful,
but...don't worry.

52
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,920
We'll get them.

53
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,320
Yeah.

54
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,440
Fuck, the door is open.

55
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,440
Did you leave it like this? No.

56
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,080
I was just in the bedroom,
and I checked.

57
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,800
The camera's still there,
but something's not right.

58
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,320
I feel like someone's been in here.

59
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,480
Yeah,
I'll get some colleagues onto it.

60
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,400
What are you doing?

61
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,800
Nothing.

62
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,000
See you later, love.

63
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,120
Morning.

64
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,400
Is this all we've got?

65
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,520
What, have you given up
talking to me now?

66
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,960
I'm off.

67
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:40,040
All right? I think Spencer
broke into my house, now this.

68
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,480
What's this?

69
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,400
Oh, shit.

70
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,560
I'm not having that prick
threaten my family -

71
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,920
you make that clear to him.

72
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,920
Mate, you're going to have
to do that yourself.

73
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,720
I've told you, we can't keep
running away from this, Dan.

74
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,880
We owe him money,
and he wants payback.

75
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,600
Take that and put it in the house.

76
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,080
Shit. What are you playing at?!

77
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,200
It's mine.

78
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,120
I thought it'd give you peace of mind
until we get him off our back.

79
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,480
Is he that dangerous?

80
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,560
MUTED: You knew exactly
who he was...

81
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,280
THEY ARGUE INDISTINCTLY

82
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,360
We need to go and see him, Dan.

83
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,880
Wait here.

84
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,400
CAR DOOR SHUTS

85
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,840
Hiya.

86
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,680
No-one.

87
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,160
I'm afraid we're going
to have to suspend your classes.

88
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:27,400
Just take some time off and...and...
let's stay in touch, yeah?

89
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,320
Oh, yeah, how was the spa weekend?

90
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,800
It was OK.

91
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,240
God, you're hard to please.

92
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,160
Jeez, come on.
That place sounded amazing.

93
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,800
Like I said, it was fine.

94
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,480
OK, well, I have something
that might cheer you up.

95
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,080
Who said I needed cheering up?

96
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,800
Jesus, all right.
Won't bother, then. God.

97
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,720
Sorry.

98
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,320
Go on.

99
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,520
That's all right.
SHE CLEARS THROAT

100
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,280
So, I was looking through the shots
I took of the cops,

101
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,600
and I found a picture where
you can see the guy's face clearly.

102
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,240
I saw this guy this morning.

103
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,240
He was talking to my neighbour.
They were having a right barney.

104
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,880
Wait, didn't you say
your neighbour was a traffic cop?

105
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,280
No, I already asked him.
He said he wasn't there.

106
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,520
Yeah, but do you believe him?
Um, I'm looking for Pete.

107
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,800
Uh, he's just at the back there.

108
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,920
Thank you. No worries.
Um, someone's here to see you.

109
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,560
Um...

110
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,280
..that's his wife.

111
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,000
Uh, excuse me.

112
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,320
Hey.

113
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,520
Um, I have had
a couple of classes cancelled,

114
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,520
so I was wondering
if you had time for a coffee.

115
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,280
Um...

116
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,520
Yeah, sure.

117
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,080
Great.

118
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,000
We...

119
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,480
We don't need to hash it out.
It's all...fine.

120
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,800
Is it, though?

121
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,320
It didn't seem like it
when you left.

122
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,320
Pete, I don't like
to leave things broken,

123
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,320
so I need you to tell me
if I have broken anything.

124
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,000
Um...

125
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,800
..I find all of this really awkward.

126
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,360
I can normally tell a mile off

127
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,160
if one partner is keen
and the other one isn't,

128
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,120
but honestly,

129
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:05,400
it's nearly always the man
who is pressuring the woman, so...

130
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,280
And Evie gave me the green light
from both of you,

131
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,200
so I thought it would...
What? Did she?

132
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,280
Yeah.

133
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,720
So, you weren't on board?

134
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:25,080
I honestly...don't know. Um...

135
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,200
OK, well...

136
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,480
..I just hope
that we can still be friends.

137
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,880
Yeah. Um...

138
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,760
Jesus Christ.

139
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,080
'Ey up.

140
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,840
It's been a while.

141
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,680
Glad you finally saw sense.

142
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,760
Did you break into my house?

143
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,680
What? No.

144
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,960
Not yet, anyway.

145
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,480
Keep your fucking goons
away from my son.

146
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:23,280
Danny... You said "son".
Just the one, is that right?

147
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,960
Don't push me.

148
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,040
That's precisely
what I've been doing.

149
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,240
All right, OK. Step back then,
Danny, for fuck's sake.

150
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,920
Or you will find out
how far I'm willing to go.

151
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,840
I will hurt your family. Whoa, whoa.
Do you understand that, copper?

152
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,840
That's enough of that chat.

153
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,120
Let's not go there, eh?

154
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,000
We've come to cooperate.

155
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,720
All right, Danny?

156
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,920
Aren't we, Danny?

157
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,320
Let's just...

158
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,680
What do you want?

159
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,280
Well, you had some things of mine,

160
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,640
but then you lost 'em...

161
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,000
..so you need to go and find 'em
and bring 'em back to me.

162
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,080
What? Are you serious?

163
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,320
If it were easy,
I'd be doing it myself.

164
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,160
Who was it?

165
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,400
They're not local.

166
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,440
I've leant on plenty of folk.

167
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,920
It's not the usual suspects.

168
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,440
Talk is there's a crew
from out of town running the docks.

169
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,800
You got any names?

170
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,120
Nope.

171
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,760
Cheer up, lads.

172
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,280
It shouldn't be too difficult

173
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,880
for a pair of action heroes
like yourselves.

174
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,160
Now, fuck off, the pair of you.

175
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,000
Dan...

176
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,960
EVIE: Danny.

177
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,520
Danny!

178
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,640
Are you avoiding me? What?

179
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,120
It was a really big thing for me.
Is it always like that, or...?

180
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,160
No.

181
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,520
No.

182
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,600
SHE LAUGHS

183
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,640
Oh, I'm not the only one.

184
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,440
I can't stop thinking about you.

185
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,400
I get it, but it's...
it's a bit dangerous.

186
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,040
It's dangerous because...?

187
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,080
You know why.

188
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,960
Well, yeah.

189
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,280
Look, you're so gorgeous and...

190
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,880
..yeah, I want you...

191
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,480
We can't go there if our partners
aren't on board, can we?

192
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,440
But what if they were?
But yours isn't.

193
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,960
Yeah, but he'll come around.

194
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,680
But until he does,
we can't go there again.

195
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,600
Take care of yourself, yeah?

196
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,600
ON TV: Which means
you've earned two points

197
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,520
from a total of 20 points, OK?

198
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,440
You've now got ten points
to pick up.

199
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,520
You've now only got 15.5 seconds
to choose.

200
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,920
Next category,
your next question is music.

201
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,280
You've got 15.5 seconds remaining.

202
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,440
HE SWITCHES TV OFF

203
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,440
We need to have
a difficult conversation

204
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,920
if we're going to move on.

205
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,240
OK.

206
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,080
That night...

207
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,760
..you told Becka I was up for it.

208
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,080
I never said that.
Pete, that isn't true.

209
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,840
We talked about it.

210
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,600
I-I didn't plan this.
It just happened.

211
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,480
It did not just happen.

212
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,560
You MADE it happen.

213
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,080
SHE SIGHS

214
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,000
What did you do with him?

215
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,000
Oh, come on. Really?

216
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,640
Did you fuck him?

217
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,160
SHE SCOFFS

218
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,840
Did you?
We just messed around a bit.

219
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,640
Look, we took this risk
to see if it would work for us.

220
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,840
Ah, well, it obviously worked
for you, didn't it?

221
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,240
And it would have worked for you
if you chilled out about it.

222
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,280
Pete, the amount of men
who'd give their right arm

223
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,520
for a night with Becka.
Oh, so, it's my fault, is it?

224
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,880
Because I didn't just chill out?

225
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,480
You're the one who didn't want
to become boring and suburban.

226
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,280
There's nothing
more boring and suburban

227
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,880
than trying to fuck the neighbours.

228
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,200
Look...

229
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,320
..I am sad that
this has made you angry...

230
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,320
..but you don't need to be.

231
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,120
I know you fucked him.

232
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,680
Hi, mate.

233
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,800
All right, mate.

234
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:19,120
Roseville Road.
Colossus Building Supplies.

235
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,880
Apparently, run by a guy
called Eddie Smallwood.

236
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,120
Sorry, what's this?
You'll have to remind me.

237
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,320
HE CHUCKLES

238
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,080
Last week...

239
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,440
..I think you lied.

240
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,000
I think you were there.

241
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,840
Are you angry with me
about something?

242
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,320
It seems like you might be.

243
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,920
If so...

244
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,040
..let's have it out. No, no.
Colossus Building Supplies, OK?

245
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,000
It's actually owned
by Robbie Spencer,

246
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,640
and that's who you were talking to.

247
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,520
But why would he need
two traffic cops, hmm?

248
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,480
You protecting something?

249
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,080
I mean, it's obviously not
building supplies, is it?

250
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,880
I mean this really sincerely,
because I genuinely like you.

251
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,160
I think you're a good guy.

252
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,480
I would really back off
on this one.

253
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,320
So, it was you?

254
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,880
Whatever you're chasing,
it's not worth it just for a story.

255
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,360
How about we talk off the record?
You're going to get hurt.

256
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,240
Maybe Evie, too.

257
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,160
Is that what you want?

258
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,440
MOTORCYCLE ENGINE STARTS

259
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,720
Right, Alan,
let's get you inside, shall we?

260
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,080
Thanks for all your help.

261
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,800
You know where we are
if you need us.

262
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,600
Yeah, I really do.
Thanks ever so much. Bye.

263
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,840
Back home, finally.

264
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,080
Yeah.

265
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,720
Did you manage something to eat?

266
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,000
N-No.

267
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,480
Well, wouldn't you like
to try a little bit of soup?

268
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,200
No.

269
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,720
You need me now, don't you, Alan?

270
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,760
Do you know, I've barely had time
to try that stairlift

271
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,480
these last couple of weeks?

272
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,680
High time I took
a good look upstairs.

273
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,280
STAIRLIFT WHIRS

274
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,440
BELL RINGS,
CHILDREN CHATTER INDISTINCTLY

275
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,680
Right, class, that is playtime.

276
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,240
Walk, don't run.

277
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,840
Thank you.

278
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,400
Oh, thank God!

279
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,040
SHE LAUGHS

280
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,480
TEARFULLY: Thank you, God,
for forgiving me.

281
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,920
Thank you for pursuing me, and...

282
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,480
..for showing me my worthiness.

283
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,520
Thank you for blessing me
with this gift.

284
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,880
Hello.

285
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,680
Oh, thank you.

286
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,360
Mrs Whitwell, glad I caught you.

287
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,680
Hey, how are you doing?
Uh, good, thank you.

288
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,040
Um, listen,

289
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,640
we still need the payment
for the school trip.

290
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,120
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

291
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,600
Um, yes,
I will sort that right now.

292
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,240
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Thank you. Sorry about that.

293
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,840
Don't worry.
SHE CHUCKLES

294

INDISTINCT CHATTER IN BACKGROUND

295
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,600
Want anything else?

296
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,320
I've got something I know you want.

297
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,560
How did you get that photo, Alan?

298
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,840
Did you take it or did you steal it?

299
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,600
Don't. Don't what?
Answer me, yes or no.

300
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,400
Did you steal it?

301
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,440
You thought I was too old
and crocked and useless,

302
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,920
so instead you sat up there,

303
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,320
fantasising over some unattainable
young woman.

304
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,360
Well...

305
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,240
..there you go.

306
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,280
You sit there and look.

307
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:23,640
Hiya. Just dropping Ollie home.
Becka needed to pop to the shops.

308
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:27,240
Oh, right, yeah. Thanks.
Bye, Evie. Bye!

309
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,040
See you later.

310
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,120
Hey, did you move money
from our savings account?

311
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,120
Uh, don't think so.

312
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,200
I thought the loan

313
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,200
for the new kitchen
was in that account?

314
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:06,680
Oh, yeah. I, uh...
gave a deposit to the builder.

315
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,800
Well, I think we should try
and get that back.

316
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,200
We don't have the money
for that work right now.

317
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,520
Yeah, it'll be fine.

318
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,400
Danny...

319
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,120
..I've effectively lost my job.

320
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,040
It's pretty serious.

321
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,120
How much did you give him?

322
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,880
Uh, I don't remember.

323
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,280
What do you mean you don't remember?

324
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,520
Well, it can't have been all of it.

325
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,400
There was ten grand in there.

326
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,840
I'll check it tomorrow,
go see the builder.

327
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,040
I thought you had work tomorrow?

328
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:41,160
I do, but...don't worry,
I'll sort it.

329
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,160
INAUDIBLE SPEECH

SHE MOANS

333
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,840
SHE BREATHES SHAKILY

334

337
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,680
Oh, Jean,

338
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:39,080
I'm so sorry to hear
about Alan's stroke.

339
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:43,120
Yeah, it's been very tough
but, you know, we're coping.

340
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,960
How did it happen?

341
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,080
Yeah, well, Alan's been having
headaches for a while now, so...

342
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,680
Lucky they found him at Becka's.

343
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,960
Mm, yeah. Sorry?

344
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,080
Oh, good morning, Becka. Morning.

345
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:00,160
Now, you send my love to Alan, Jean.
I will, thanks.

346
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,320
Hey. What's going on?
Oh, hi. I'm so glad to see you.

347
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,680
I meant to leave you a note,

348
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,400
but it's just been so hectic,
you know?

349
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,720
Um, as Gloria was saying,
they found Alan at yours,

350
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,720
because I thought I saw an intruder.

351
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,400
And when Alan went round,
your back doors were open.

352
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,160
What? Yeah, I mean,

353
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,360
I think if there had been
anyone there,

354
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,040
well, they'd obviously fled,
you know, before they got in.

355
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,160
Christ! Well, thank God Alan
was there to interrupt them.

356
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,200
Yeah, well, he had a good look around

357
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,200
and made sure nobody
was inside, you know?

358
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:35,000
Um, and that's why he had
the stroke in your house.

359
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,320
Oh, my God.

360
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,800
I hope the paramedics didn't leave
too much of a mess.

361
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,880
I'm really sorry.
He was just trying to help.

362
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,880
No, no, no, Jean. Jean, I'm sorry.
That's awful.

363
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,720
Alan must have been so scared.

364
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,640
Look, if there's anything
that I can do...

365
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,560
Um, I've done yoga before,
with stroke survivors.

366
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,120
Oh, no, honestly, it's OK,

367
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,320
because the hospital
have offered rehab, you know?

368
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,840
It wouldn't be a problem.

369
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,520
I mean, work is really slow
right now,

370
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,720
so, really,
you would be doing me a favour.

371
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,080
Well, in that case, you know,

372
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,360
maybe we could arrange something
sometime.

373
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,440
But I've really got
to be getting off, get back to him.

380

There you go.

381
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,640
Wow. Bigger than your head, that.

383
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,400
No, I'm all right.

You need to learn faster.

388
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,760
Fair enough.

389
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,000
Because I was hoping

390
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,640
that you and I could spend
lots of time together.

391
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,800
Why haven't I met you until now?

392
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,800
Because...

393
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:40,280
..your mother and I weren't in touch
for a long time.

394
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,080
Did you know about me?

395
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,400
I did.

396
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,840
I can't tell you how sorry I am
I haven't been around.

397

398
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:00,480
Well, not far.
The other side of the city.

399
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,920

400
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,800

401
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,640
My family.

402
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,760
Can I meet them?

403
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:19,320
Well, let's see, hey?

404
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,200
You don't want me to?

405
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,960
Course I do.

406
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,120

Oh, thanks for coming.

410

Pete sends his love.
He's just a bit tied up with work.

411
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,120
Oh, not to worry.

412
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,240
Oh, love, you shouldn't have.

413
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,160
Look, we're doing presents
in a bit,

414
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,600
so I'll come back in a sec,
all right? Yeah. Yeah, sure.

415
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:11,440
Now, then... Hiya, Dad.

416
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,640
Hello, you.

417
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,000
Ah!

418
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,160
Hey! Hello!

419
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,480
Hiya. Are you all right?
Hi. You look great.

420
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,960
Oh! You've no idea
how much it means to Mum

421
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,200
that you're here, you know.

422
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,040
He's pleased, too, in his own way.

423
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:34,840
Rach, look at you!
Mm. Isn't she blooming, hmm?

424
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,600
He loves me being pregnant.

425
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,440
More than I do, probably.

426
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,040
Sorry, sis. I didn't...

427
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,960
We don't have to talk about it.
I-I just...

428
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,240
No. It's... It's not that.

429
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,800

430
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,240
You're not.

Oh, Evie!

433
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,880
Oh, it's so hard not telling anyone!

434
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,440
Oh, just keep it...keep it quiet,
yeah? Yeah. It's so early.

435
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,360
Please, join us in prayer

436
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,040

the birthday celebrations.

437
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,760

00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,880
Make haste, O God, to deliver me.

445
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,760
Make haste to help me, O God.

446
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,360

Well, if it isn't
our favourite grass.

449
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,760
Surprised to see you out so soon.

450
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,880
Early release for good behaviour.

451
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,840
You're a reformed man, no doubt.

452
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,320
Well, the food got even worse,

453
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,880
so, yeah,
I'd like to stay out, if I can.

454
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,240
Um, just one second, sorry.

455
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,600
So, have you got something?

456
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,600
There's a guy inside.

457
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,480
He's part of some gang run
by this Belgian dude,

458
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,360
who are running all the docks
on the east coast.

459
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,960
Their MO is intercepting
illegal cargo on the docks

460
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,800
being brought in by other criminals,
which they then sell on themselves.

461
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,920
So, what are they nicking?
Any high-value goods,

462
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,760
but the more untraceable,
the better.

463
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:39,920
This Belgian guy, Lars something,
he's got one interest -

uncut diamonds,
which he can trade in Antwerp.

00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,560
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

533
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,880
You all right? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

534
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,360
Cops came looking for stolen goods
after a tip-off. Come on.

535
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,240
Clearly,
they're searching for something,

536
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,520
but they couldn't find it
because the gang came back.

537
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,560
Wonder what they're after?
Wait. Hold on.

538
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,520
RECORDING PLAYS:
This Belgian guy, Lars something,

539
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,680
he's got one interest -

540
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,040
uncut diamonds,
which he can trade in Antwerp.

541
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,520
Now we're getting somewhere.

542
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,240
HE GRUNTS

543
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,640
ENGINE STARTS

544
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,800
Yes!

545
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,480
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
Come on. Come on, mate.

546
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,160
Go, go, go, go.

547
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,760
I did sort of think, what if this is
some kind of undercover op

548
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,280
and we're treading on their toes?
No, no, no. Do you know....?

549
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:59,760
Danny looked guilty as sin
when I talked to him.

550
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,480
Bye!

551
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,680
HORN HONKS

552
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,360
PHONE VIBRATES

553
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,800
Yeah.

554
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,200
OVER PHONE: Hi, Rachel.
Is Evie there?

555
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:39,880
Hiya, Pete. You've just missed her.
She's just set off home.

556
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,080
Ah, that's fine.

557
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:43,680
I forgot to leave her keys,
but I'll be home before her.

558
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:45,120
Hey, I know it's a secret,

559
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,600
so I hope I'm not speaking
out of turn,

560
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:51,240
but can I just say how excited
we all are about your news?

561
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,520
Sorry?

562
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:58,040
The whole family are
just delighted for you both, Pete.

563
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:00,360
Can't believe
you're going to be a dad!

564
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,320
Pete?
