Oh, I'm so sorry, Peter.

2
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,720
He's so excited about what you've
got in those bin bags.

3
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,320
My fish died, hence the smell.

4
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,720
Oh, how awful!

5
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,120
How?

6
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,600
Pfft, I don't know.

7
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,000
Aw, I'm terribly sorry.

00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,680

Hey, you, er, you weren't at

12
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,680
a building supplies place in
Sheepscar yesterday, were you?

13
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,640
Where? Roseville Road.

14
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,640
God, no. All day in the office,
sadly.

15
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,520
Oh, I could have sworn it, was you?

16
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,880
Certainly looked like a couple of
traffic cops.

17
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,160
Did you get their numbers?

18
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,240
No.

19
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,040
You got some big scoop?

20
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,400
Might do, yeah.

21
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,200
Can't say yet, but it'll be a corker
if I can pull it off.

22
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,080
Nice, good luck.

23
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,920
Anything I can do to help?

24
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,560
Actually, if I wanted to check
someone's criminal record,

25
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,440
but there was nothing on file...

26
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,000
Well, like who?

27
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,800
Local businessman, for example?

28
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,120
I'd lose my job if I did something
like that, sorry.

29
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,880

49

We both could have been killed.

50
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,800

00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,120
I'm sorry.

Don't worry about that, leave that

serious shit with Spencer.

Well, in the relationship, yeah, but
you know,

00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,760

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,880
Right. Erm, well, I mean, it looks
like all the school mums

151

00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,880
Cool.

181
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,080
I was hoping you and I could go out
together

182
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,160
next time I come over.

183
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,160
Yeah, let's just see how we're
going.

184
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,720
It's a lot for him to take in.

185
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,440
I can lip-read, you know?

186
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,280
Oh, there you are!

187
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,080
Me and Miss painted a dancer
together all day.

188
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,480
Oh, I think Miss Greenwood would
like a rest now.

189
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,960
No, not at all.

190
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,000
All she talks about is
Miss Greenwood.

191
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,080
Obsessed, aren't you?

192
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,320
I haven't seen you, since...

193
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,960
I just want to say, how sorry I am.

194
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,640
Thank you.

195
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,520
Right, come on.

196
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,440
Bye, Miss Greenwood. Bye.

197
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,640
Mum! Mum!

198
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,960
Hello.

199
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,480
Got picked for the football team.

200
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,480
Yes, of course you did. Well done.

201
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,880
Mum? Yeah? What's a whore?

202
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,600
Olly, who said that to you?

203
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,640
Mm, they didn't. Just heard.

204
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,120
OK, well, that's a very
disrespectful word

205
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,520
that people say about women,

206
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,640
and you are never to use it. Do you
understand?

207
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,960
OK.

208
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,720
Seems like a sweet kid.

209
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,840
Danny, let's get a few things
clear.

210
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,560
If you swan in here like some kind
of saviour,

211
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,040
and then just fuck off again
the moment things get tough,

212
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,960
you will destroy that boy.

213
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,520
I'm here now, for good.

214
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,640
You have my word.

215
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,120
Fine...

216
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,960
..so, tell your family.

217
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,200
Yeah, not now.

218
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,360
Why not?

219
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,080
Scared she'll leave you? No, leave
Becka out of it.

220
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,000
Embarrassed cos of how we met?

221
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,280
Worried you might lose your job if
your bosses found out?

222
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,880
I need him in your life properly.

223
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,960
He has a brother, for Christ's sake.

224
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,400
Don't you think that they should
meet?

225
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,280
She's going to find out anyway,
Danny,

226
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,840
so just get it out in the open.

227
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,800
I've told you, I need time.

228
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,480
Look, I've got to go, but...

229
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,320
..I'll be back next week.

230
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,600
Take him out for a day, OK?

231
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,000
OK.

232
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,840
I mean, where the hell is he picking
up words like that?

233
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,960
Oh, come on, he didn't know what it
meant.

234
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,800
Yeah.

235
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,720
Are you all right?

236
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,760
Yeah, I'm just fed up

237
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,280
of well-meaning mums telling me how
sorry they are.

238
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,200
People really need to mind their own
business.

239
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,680
You know, I've wanted to be a mum
since I was young, Becks.

240
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,280
What if it doesn't happen?

241
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,760
You don't know that it won't.

242
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,920
Did you find it easy?

243
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,000
We weren't trying, it just sort of
happened.

244
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,560
I mean, we weren't exactly being
careful.

245
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,520
You must have been open to
the possibility, then.

246
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,480
Well, it's more that we were young
and reckless.

247
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,880
Well, it all worked out OK.

248
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,880
Yeah.

249
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,840
I mean, this isn't necessarily the
life that I would have chosen.

250
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,120
What do you mean?

251
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,760
Well, there's a world where we'd
still be travelling

252
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,960
and having wild adventures.

253
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,440
I know you can't do that forever.

254
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,960
Sorry, I don't mean to be moaning.

255
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,720
I have an awful lot to be grateful
for.

256
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,200
No, don't be daft.

257
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,320
We always want what we don't have.

258
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,880
Didn't you think to ask me first?

259
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,120
I'm asking you now.

260
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,520
You've already told her we're going.

261
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,120
OK, so, I'll call her and say,
"Thanks, but no,

262
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,800
"we don't want to come on a free
luxury spa weekend".

263
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,840
I just... What?

264
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,680
..I just feel like we're spending
all our free time with them.

265
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,360
What is your problem with them?

266
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,480
I don't have a problem, they're
perfectly nice. It's not...

267
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,080
Well, good, then get over yourself.

268
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,880
We'll just go and have a fun weekend.

269
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,840
Babe, can...

270
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,320
..can I just say something?

271
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,600
I feel, I feel like you're a million
miles away from me half the time.

272
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,880
I'm fine.

273
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,200
And we have been through something
really tough.

274
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,040
Yeah, and now we're moving on
from it.

275
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,640
I'm just trying to make you happy.

276
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,440
This will make me happy.

277
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,480
OK, if that's what you want.

278
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,800
As long as it's just,

279
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,480
you know, a normal weekend.

280
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,080
What is that supposed to mean?

281
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,800
Oh, come on, you must have thought
it.

282
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,520
Why don't you just stop worrying?

283
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,200
We'll just go and have a nice time.

284
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:07,800
CHOPPING VEGETABLES LOUDLY

285
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,440
Olly, I said turn it off five
minutes ago.

286
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,040
Just one more minute.

287
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,480
Now.

288
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,200
Well, if the stupid controller
worked properly,

289
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,240
then I would.

290
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,720
Dad, I hadn't finished.

291
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,080
Do you know how lucky you are
to have all this stuff?

292
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,760
Do you?

293
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,960
There was no need for that.

294
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,400
Doesn't respect me.

295
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,960
Oh, bollocks, he hangs on your every
word.

296
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,000
You've been in a shitty mood since
you got in.

297
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,480
What's going on?

298
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,760
Nothing.

299
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,600
Listen,

300
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,120
you and I are gonna go away

301
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,720
and have a lovely weekend together.

302
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,240
Yeah...

303
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,320
Yeah, all right.

304
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:32,920
SHRIEKING

305
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:47,160
SHRIEKS CONTINUE

306
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,320
SCREAMING

307
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,320
SCREAMING

308
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,840
SHE SHRIEKS

309
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,440
Sh, sh, sh... Danny! Sorry.

310
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,960
Sorry, I thought you saw me.

311
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,480
I thought someone was being attacked.

312
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,440
Yeah, I know, me too.

313
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,760
It's just some foxes mating.

314
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,400
Oh, it's not?

315
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,960
Ugh.

316
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,240
They don't sound like they're
having a very nice time.

317
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,680
No, but who are we to judge?

318
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,400
Exactly, we all do it.

319
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,160
Just not in a bush at two in
the morning.

320
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,240
Hm.

321
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,600
Well, I guess I'll see you tomorrow
at the hotel.

322
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,760
What? What are you guys coming?

323
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,720
Wait, did Becka not tell you?

324
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,440
No, no, no... What?

325
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,720
..probably wanted to surprise me.

326
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,200
Oh.

327
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,160
I hope it's a nice surprise.

328
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,880
Goodnight.

329
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,960
Becka, this place looks incredible.

330
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,640
They gave you all this for free?

331
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,440
Yeah. Amazing, what 30,000 followers
can get you these days.

332
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,520
Whoa!

333
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,400
Didn't know we were friends
with such a VIP.

334
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,600
Oh, hardly. No, I just persuaded

335
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,960
a bunch of yoga mums to cough up
for a weekend here.

336
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:02,080
Well, here's to the yoga mums
and their disposable income.

337
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,080
Mm-hm, and Danny's mum
for child care.

338
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,760
Oh, I'll definitely drink
to that. Cheers.

339
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,800
Cheers. Cheers.

340
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,680
You have so many followers.
How do you keep on top of it?

341
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,640
I just post a few things here
and there.

342
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,880
I don't even read the comments.

343
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,440
Yeah, but ask her how long she
takes setting up for each shot.

344
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,920
Yeah, OK. Well, the phone is down
this weekend,

345
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,400
and I'm living in the moment... Mm.

346
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,480
..speaking of which, itineraries.

347
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,920
So, Evie and I have a facial at two,

348
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,560
followed by a sauna and steam room.

349
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,600
Oh.

350
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,880
..and you both have massages.

351
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,600
Nice. Oh! Sorry, Pete has a massage?
Mm-hm.

352
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,240
Er, well, first time for
everything.

353
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,280
That's the spirit.

354
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,520
So, which room shall we have?

355
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,000
Ladies' choice.

356
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,200
All right.

357
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,240
All done, and ready for lift off.

358
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,520
Ah, this is gonna be life-changing.

359
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,640
Well, that's what we're here for.

360
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,600
Thank you so much. OK.

361
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,280
So, what's this big story
you're investigating?

362
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,160
Oh, it's pretty boring, really.

363
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,720
You know, I've genuinely never had
a massage before.

364
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,120
Seriously?

365
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,920
You must have.

366
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,560
You and your lovely lady
need to live a little.

367
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,240
As you keep telling me. Mm.

368
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,520
Go on then, enlighten me,
massage king.

369
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,080
Hm-mm, it's simple.

370
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,520
Just be clear if they're being too
rough or too soft,

371
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,000
then just lie back and drift off.

372
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,760
Oh, and get ready to activate
the naked granny card,

373
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,560
if the masseuse is ridiculously hot.

374
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,600
What?

375
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,840
Well, you don't want any
embarrassing-arousal situations

376
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,000
if you're facing upwards.

377
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:15,720
So, think of the least arousing
thing you can muster,

378
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,240
such as your granny naked.
Ah, come on.

379
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,320
Yeah.

380
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,160
Hi, guys. I'm Mel, this is Siobhan.

381
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,560
So, you're down for the full body
massage today, is that right?

382
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,040
Yeah.

383
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,240
OK.

384
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,440
Looks like you're gonna need
the full granny activation.

385
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,520
Mm.

386
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,520
Oh, I can't believe this is a
freebie.

387
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,880
I'm so glad that we could do this.
It's my way of saying thank you.

388
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,360
For what?

389
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,360
For livening up a very boring
cul-de-sac.

390
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,600
Me? You're the one livening
things up.

391
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,120
I feel very boring.

392
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:02,280
Right, come on, this, this set up
that you've got with Danny.

393
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,760
I'm fascinated, I've got so many
questions.

394
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,360
What do you want to know?

395
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,400
Do you get jealous, when he's with
another woman?

396
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,640
No, no, it's an act of trust.

397
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,760
We have very open, honest
conversations,

398
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,760
and we discuss the rules.

399
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,360
I find it really liberating.

400
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,520
I know that he trusts me,
and I trust him.

401
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,000
It's amazing, wow.

402
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,680
So, if...

403
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,600
If?

404
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,120
If we wanted...

405
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,560
If you wanted to try it yourself?

406
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,160
With us?

407
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,800
Yeah.

408
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:14,080
OK, well, I think the first thing
I would ask is why?

409
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,120
Why you think you might like to?

410
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,600
Because I just...

411
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:29,920
it sounds really fun and exciting
and, well, forbidden.

412
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,480
Yeah.

413
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,240
What about Pete, though?

414
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,240
I get the impression it might not be
his thing.

415
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,080
We've spoken about it. Huh? Mm-hm.

416
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,360
To be honest, I actually think it
could be what we need.

417
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,800
Hm-mm.

418
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,640
Oh! Oh, here they are.

419
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,320
How, was it? How was the massage?

420
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,400
Oh, my God, it was amazing.

421
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,000
What? No way. Yeah.

422
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,200
How many times have I told you
to get one?

423
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,800
Mm, well, I'm a new man. I'm all
about the relaxation.

424
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,120
It had absolutely nothing to do
with

425
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,480
the insane hotness of the masseuse.

426
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,600
Ah, I see. Oh! Mmm. Oh, I see.
Well...

427
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:36,320
SINISTER ORGAN-STYLE MUSIC

428
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:44,560
MUSIC CONTINUES

429
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:51,720
MUSIC CONTINUES

430
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,640
Alan?

431
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,160
Alan?

432
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,920
What's all that?

433
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,960
Did you not even notice
the engineer?

434
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,440
Well, I've been, I've been caught up
with something.

435
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,960
Yeah, well, it's done.

436
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,720
I can come back upstairs.

437
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,280
Right, well.

438
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,480
That's wonderful news,
Jean, really.

439
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,360
Well, I feel like we've got
something to celebrate,

440
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,440
I've done you something nice,
and, I thought afterwards,

441
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,120
maybe we could go upstairs together.

442
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,680
Well, that sounds very lovely.
It's just, er...

443
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,960
I'm still working.

444
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,760
I've just got to pop out
and see a client.

445
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,000
Do you remember when we used
to live together,

446
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,320
before we were married,

447
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,960
and your mother was furious cos
we were living in sin?

448
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,240
Every day, before you went to work,

449
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,880
you used to leave me

450
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,960
a little note somewhere different
in the house.

451
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,800
It would say I love you or
I miss you.

452
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,840
I can't wait to see you.

453
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,920
I found one of those notes the other
day, in a book.

454
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,200
It said, "You're the only one for
me."

455
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,800
I thought you'd be happy for us.

456
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,000
You know, the chance to be able to
share a bed together again.

457
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,200
I am.

458
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,920
I really am, Jean.

459
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,520
Look, I've just got to pop out.

460
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,320
I won't be long. I'll be, I'll be
back soon.

461
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,440
You had no intention of telling me
you'd invited

462
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,080
the neighbours, did you?

463
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,760
I am sure that I told you.

464
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,920
Hm-mm.

465
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,560
Becka Whitwell, you are a bad girl.

466
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,840
I know, I know, I'm a fucking
nightmare.

467
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,560
Oh, there he is, ready for action.

468
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:12,520
Why don't we save it for later,
with our friends?

469
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,360
Babe, I told you this before.

470
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,200
I think it's extremely risky.

471
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,480
Our rule is, always...

472
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,160
Yeah, but I've got a good feeling.

473
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,000
It feels different.

474
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,320
Come on, let's just mix things up a
little.

475
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,680
You're making assumptions about
what they want.

476
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,240
Mm-mm, nope, she just explicitly
told me that they're both up for it.

477
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,360
What she actually said that?

478
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,400
Mm-hm.

479
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,080
I don't know about it.

480
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,440
Well, I know how much you want her.

481
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,400
The rules are there, because...

482
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,760
Danny, fuck the rules.

483
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,720
Come on, we're strong enough.

484
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,360
Let's show our friends the ropes.

485
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,480
Where's that wild side?

486
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,680
Mm, mm, OK.

487
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,960
Yeah, I want her,

488
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,480
I really want her.

489
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,440
Mm, do you want him? Mm-hm.

490
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,040
I like the way he looks at me,

491
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,000
when he's trying so hard not
to look at me,

492
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,320
so innocent.

493
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,200
You know I love to corrupt
the innocent. Mm.

494
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,080
We said no friends...

495
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,920
Mm.

496
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,640
..but... Mm.

497
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,800
I could get used to this.

498
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,480
Are you having fun?

499
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,480
Of course.

500
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,120
But?

501
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,360
It's all a bit weird.

502
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,080
Oh, come off it, Petey. In what way?

503
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,400
I don't know.

504
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,720
Yes, you do. I know exactly what
you're thinking,

505
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,480
you might as well just say it. OK.

506
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,680
Do you think we've been lured
here to be corrupted?

507
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,560
I think we're both adults,

508
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,040
and I think we can take care
of ourselves.

509
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,680
Mm, nice way to avoid answering
the question.

510
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,720
What if something did happen?

511
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,320
What are you saying?

512
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,560
I'm just asking.

513
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,560
Becka's hot, you haven't got
a pulse if you don't think that.

514
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,560
Well, yeah, duh, of course she is.

515
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,800
I think she likes you.

516
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,400
Don't think I haven't noticed
the way you look at Danny.

517
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:43,080
Do you find that threatening,
or arousing?

518
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,240
Just for the record, I think it'd be
pretty hot.

519
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,480
What are we even talking about?

520
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,000
This is totally insane.

521
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,480
Yoo-hoo, Alan!

522
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,280
Oh, I think they're away for
the weekend.

523
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,920
They went with that nice couple from
number 49.

524
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,440
Are they a musician? Yes.

525
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,480
No. Yes. Yes.

526
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,680
No? Yes! No.

527
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,400
Oh, yeah, you're right.

528
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,280
Yes? Yes. You have to know.

529
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,200
OK, am I alive?

530
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,560
No. Oh!

531
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,600
You've got to drink.

532
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,840
Yeah, mmm.

533
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,600
Argh.

534
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,080
Oh, is it David Bowie? No.

535
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,320
Erm... No, drink...

536
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,280
sorry.

537
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,760
Right. Oh, is it Prince?
Is it Prince?

538
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,800
No.

539
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,440
I'm going to be wasted before
I get this.

540
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,120
You already are.

541
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,320
Oh, sh...

542
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,520
Dammit.

543
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,720
I'll get it. Try.

544
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,080
OK, I'll get the window.

545
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,360
Yeah, get the window.

546
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,720
KNOCK AT THE DOOR

547
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,480
Someone get it. Turn off the music.

548
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,520
Oh, God.

549
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,040
Everything OK, sir?

550
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,880
Yeah, fine, fine. Yeah,
yeah, my, er,

551
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,320
my, my wife lit a candle,
but it's out now.

552
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,800
Yes, sorry. Really sorry.

553
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,840
Can we just remind guests,

554
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,600
it's a strictly no-smoking
establishment?

555
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,000
Of course. Yes. Yeah, yeah,
absolutely, yeah.

556
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,400
Good evening, sir. Yeah, yeah.

557
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,600
Whoops.

558
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,800
Oh, that's bad!

559
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,840
Who even was I?

560
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,120
Oh, my God. Pete! Pete!

561
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,680
Seriously, who? Really?

562
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,800
George Michael.

563
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,360
Oh, dear.

564
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,520
I like George Michael as well.

565
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,200
Mm.

566
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,320
Thank you.

567
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,680
Come here.

568
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,240
Wait, wait, wait.

569
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,000
I really want this, I'm just...

570
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,800
..suddenly, really nervous.

571
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,840
Why don't I go first, then?

572
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,600
Take a good look...

573
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,960
..you're allowed.

574
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,960
I want you.

575
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,160
I really want you.

576
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:26,880

PANTING AND GASPING

581
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,480
I can't, I just...

582
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,160
I can't.

583
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,600
I'm sorry.

584
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,320
SHE GASPS

585
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,240
Shit! What?

586
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,800
Shit, I think the condom broke.

587
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,720
Don't worry, I'm on the pill, so...

588
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,640
You sure? ..just don't stop.

00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,560
A ZIP PULLED DOWN

593
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,160
Argh!

594
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,360
Argh!

595
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,720
Oh, my God.

596
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,240
Argh!

597
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,000
I shouldn't have done that.

598
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,680
I told you, it's fine.

599
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,800
Are you absolutely sure?

600
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,480
Yeah.

601
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,600
Hm.

602
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:21,440
Come here.

603
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:22,720
Mm, mm.
