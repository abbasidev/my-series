No. See, it's these Indians
and the commie fucks.

18

They wanna paint Columbus as a
slave trader instead of an explorer.

You gotta admit they did
get massacred, the Indians.

them shit to make up for it.

In Napoli, a lot of people
are not so happy for Columbus...

00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:25,787
...because he was from Genoa.

35

What's the problem with Genoa?

The north of Italy always have
the money and the power.

it an Italian-pride parade...

155

to bear the pain...

183

No, Your Honor.

184

on your last bill?

185
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,469

187
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,813

last month alone.

I'm going to give you
some instructions...

189
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:35,985
...and explain the process
by which we will try this case.

190
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:37,821
The first order of business...

191
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,742
Looking out at this audience
of proud, strong, beautiful women...

192
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:46,663
...how far we have come
in this American journey.

193
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:50,417
Look how we've both preserved
the tradition of our ancestors...

194
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:56,131
...and managed to become
new Italian-American women.

195
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,967
Such flair we have added
to our image.

196
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:02,929
And yet America still sees us...

197
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:06,474
...as pizza-makers and Mama Leones.

198
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:10,687
Well, it is your job, ladies,
to spread the word.

199
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,982

been dressed in black...

200

...but we're in Moschino and Armani.

201
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:23,158
For those who say Italian-Americans
eat smelly cheese...

202
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,118
...and sip cold wine...

203
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:31,708
...tell them we're from the land
of aromatic asiago and supple Barolo.

204
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:37,338
If they say
spaghetti and meatballs...

205
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:42,510
...you tell them
orecchiette with broccoli raab.

206
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,639
If they say John Gotti...

207
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:49,976
...you tell them Rudolph Giuliani.

208
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:57,192
A Princeton study showed
that 74 percent of Americans...

209
00:12:57,359 --> 00:13:02,238
...associated Italian-Americans
with organized crime.

210
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,908
Why would they do this?

211
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:08,244
Because of the way
the media depict us.

212
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:12,540
Again, it is our job
to make sure people know...

213

of Italian-American culture...

214

...the educated, wage-earning,
law-abiding side.

215

"Longo" as you don't call me
late for dinner.

221
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,907
Small point. Didn't I read
about a more recent study...

222
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,118
...at Fairleigh-Dickinson
that found the opposite was true?

223
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:55,083
That the great majority of Americans
recognize these are fictional portrayals?

224
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:59,921
We're still looking at the sample
selection criteria used in that study.

Don't you all got something to do?

343
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,456
(DOOR CLOSING)

344
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:54,001
What's with you? I count on you
to be the most level-headed guy I got.

345
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:56,379
My father was a Knight of Columbus.

346
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,714
I'm an Italian-American,
and I pay money...

347
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:03,010
...to the Italian Anti-Defamation
Coordination Council in Bastia.

348
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:05,888
- We're the victims here.
- Oh, you write a check too?

349
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,974
Ton, let's not forget.

350
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,976
It was a friend of ours,
Joe Columbo...

351
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:13,312
...who founded the first Italian
anti-defamation organization.

352
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:16,857
- You were still out of line.
- You're right.

353
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,693
A hundred percent.

354
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,613
But?

355
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:26,367
Well, as your consigliere...

356
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,369
...since you ask...

357
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:33,874
...I think the guys and myself too,
we need your leadership on this.

358
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,503
All right.

359
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:41,173
All right, good. I understand you wanna
do something, but use your brain.

360
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:44,885
Believe me, me and Ralphie
are working on a few things.

361
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,723
This battle's gonna be won
on the P.R. level.

362
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,225
Hearts and minds.

363
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:54,562
They manipulate your image,
Columbus...

364
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,273
...you manipulate theirs.

365
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,358
All right.

366
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:11,704
(PHONE RINGING)

367
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,709
- Who's calling, please?
- Good morning, assemblyman.

368
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,169
Hey, what's up?

369
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,921
Know this protest with
the Indians and Columbus Day?

370
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:22,465
Yeah, I heard about it.

371
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,592
We need somebody to make it go away.

372
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,888
Oh, boy, that's a tough one,
real hot potato.

373
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,222
Nobody wants to touch it.

374
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,100
We just want a peaceful parade
like we've had for years...

375
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:35,978
...with no interference.
What's wrong with that?

376
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,231
It's the First Amendment
and it's Native Americans.

377
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:41,567
Very sensitive stuff.

378
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,652
My hands are tied on this one.

379
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,571
- Sorry.
- Yeah, fine.

380
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,615
I will be attending the parade
as always.

381
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:49,950
You got my support there.

382
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,285
Wish that I could...

383
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:59,418
The last time that you dated a friend
and colleague of your brother's...

384
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:03,464
...he left you flat, disappeared into
the witness protection program.

385
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:04,924
- I know.
- Now...

386
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:07,343
...another man who works
with your brother...

387
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:11,680
...unable to meet your basic needs
for love and respect...

388
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:13,474
...involved with another woman.

389
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:16,811
Which brings me back
to my childhood...

390
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:19,146
...and my mother...

391
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:21,649
...and my father.
Now we're talking.

392
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:25,611
Where I had no love
and no support.

393
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:29,490
And where I was shamed
and ridiculed for being artistic.

394
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:32,118
In your relationship
with these men...

395
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:35,037
...you have replaced your father
with your brother...

396
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:39,166
...as a figure of authority
that you need to prove something to.

397
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:40,835
You set up these scenarios...

398
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:43,963
...with these men similar
to your father and your brother...

399
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:49,635
...seeking your brother,
i.e. your father's, acceptance.

400
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:51,887
- The hell with them.
- I know.

401
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:54,390
The work is to make new choices...

402
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:57,226
...that have nothing to do
with old patterns.

403
00:23:57,394 --> 00:24:00,896
I want to, Sandy. I do.

404
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,524
God, give me the strength.

405
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,192
She will.

406
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:12,032
Your Star-Ledger interview conflicts
with Eye On New Jersey.

407
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:20,583
Del Redclay, right?
I knew it.

408
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:23,085
Yeah, I saw you on channel 21...
No, don't get up.

409
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:26,422
I'm Henry Caruso,
pleased to meet you.

410
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,886
- Now, this lovely lady.
- Maggie Donner, I'm Del's TA.

411
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:34,930
Yes. Yes, I can see that.

412
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:41,729
Well, I might as well get
to the point.

413
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:44,523
(SIGHS)

414
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,694
I represent a group
of concerned citizens who are...

415
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:52,740
...very upset about this protest
you're spearheading.

416
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,116
No puns intended.

417
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:58,037
- Who do you represent?
- Italians...

418
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:00,039
...here in New Jersey.

419
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:02,208
Good people.

420
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:04,585
Family people.

421
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,589
And they've asked me to tell you
that it's not in your best interest...

422
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,382
...to go through with this thing.

423
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:14,220
If you've come here to intimidate me,
you don't know about Indian resolve.

424
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:16,931
Del, should I call security?

425
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,267
You remember this guy?

426
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:22,269
Iron Eyes Cody, he was an actor.

427
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:26,065

Part Cherokee, part Cree.

430
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:38,244
He wasn't even a fucking Indian.

431
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:42,498
Second-generation Sicilian
from Louisiana named Espera DeCorti.

432
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:46,126
- Well, I think you better leave now.
- The guy's a total fucking phony.

433
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:48,337
A total fugazy.

00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,965
Even Jay Silverheels knew it.

435
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:53,133
But he kept it quiet.

436
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:55,803
Well, we're not gonna.

437
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,305
You keep up your bullshit...

438
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:01,892
...we're gonna go wide with this thing.
Knock yourself out.

439
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,985
Jesus Christ, is this true?

440
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:13,612
This is a fucking disaster!

441
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,615
Chill out.
You didn't know about this?

442
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:20,494
- It's been on Access Hollywood, E!...
- This is a major P.R. boner.

443
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:24,832
It's been researched. Cody was definitely
Native American, total environmentalist.

444
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:29,336
- Are you sure about this?
- Look, Del, I'm one-eighth Italian myself.

445
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,630
You are? You never told me that.

446
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,217
My great-great something-or-other
was a pony soldier.

447
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:39,722
Well, actually, he was a violinist
attached to 7th Cavalry.

448
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:45,853
That is just one person's opinion,
Anthony.

449

With 50 men, we could subgate them."

"And make them do whatever we want."

457
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:09,168
- That doesn't sound like a slave trader?
- George Washington had slaves.

458
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,879
- The father of our country.
- Well, what's your point?

459
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:15,549
His history teacher, Mr. Cushman,
is teaching your son...

460
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:18,552
...that if Columbus was alive today,
he would go on trial...

461
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,556
...for crimes against humanity,
like Miloševic in, you know, Europe.

462
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:26,769
- Your teacher said that?
- It's not just my teacher, it's the truth.

463
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:29,063
It's in my history book.

464
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:34,193
- You finally read a book and it's bullshit.
- Tony.

You have to walk in Columbus' shoes
to see what he went through.

467
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,909
People thought the world was flat,
for crying out loud.

468
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:46,080
Then he lands on an island with savages
on it. That took a lot of guts.

469
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:49,541
You remember when we went to Florida?
The heat? And those bugs?

470
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:52,002
Like it took guts to murder people.

471
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:55,089
- He was a victim of his time.
- Who cares? It's what he did.

472
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:58,634
He discovered America, is what he did.
He was a brave Italian explorer.

473
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:03,222

is a hero. End of story.

00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,952
How he loved her.

00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:14,334
It's cross-town, 68th Street.

485
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,673
You know what I heard one time?

486
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:22,676
Sil was on the phone.
He was talking with somebody...

487
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:26,388
...about how Bobby was the only one
of them who doesn't have a goomar.

488
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,848
They were laughing at him.

00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:32,394
- Who was he talking to on the phone?
- I don't know.

I'll go first this time. I'll bring
my eggplant parma over to Bobby's.

about who's gonna do what when.

...I'm sorry I missed Allegra's
nursing school graduation. Unforgivable.

497
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,848
But I made it up to her.

498
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:14,645
Stick it in your ass.

- What the fuck, John?

- I don't wanna talk about it.

ass on the Frelinghuysen Avenue bullshit.

00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:10,784
I'm surrounded by death.
My husband, my son, my friend.

513
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:15,289
- I don't know what to tell you, Ro.
- There's pieces torn out of me.

514
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,291
Chunks of me that are dead.

515
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,460
And look at me.
My youth, my looks, they're gone.

516
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:22,087
No.

517
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:25,424
That's from not taking care
of yourself.

518
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:29,636
- Dwelling on all this stuff.
- It's not stuff.

519
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:33,974
Do you have any idea
what it feels like?

520
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,350
Do you?

521
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:39,146
It's not stuff. It's death, it's pain.

522
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:48,155
I'm having a lot of trouble
dealing with this.

523
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,657
- I don't know.
- You don't know what?

524
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:55,287
I don't think I can do this.

525
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:59,041
I don't think I can help you.

526
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:05,130
You need a lot right now and
I don't think there's anything I can do.

527
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:09,134
You can be there for me,
you can comfort me.

528
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:12,512
What about me?

529
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,183
- What do I get out of it?
- There it is. Right there.

530
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:18,185
What do you get?

531
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:23,023
How about your every need taken
care of. Sexually, everything.

532
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:26,276
All your shit!
It's all about you, isn't it?

533
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:29,571
It's not all about me, but I mean...

534
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:32,866
...let's be realistic.
Let's be realistic?

535
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,661
What? You wanna leave me?

536
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:41,500
Yeah.

537
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,710
Then get the fuck out.

538
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:48,006
- It doesn't have to be like this.
- How should it be?

539
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:50,884
How the fuck should it be?

540
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:04,189
Somehow Carmine found out
we were flipping properties...

541
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,858
...so your take's a little less
than we talked about.

542
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:09,861
He makes an issue out of Zellman?

543
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:13,573
- What's this one called, Hesh?
- This is Pie-O-My.

544
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:16,576
Just broke her maiden at Belmont
last month. A lot of speed.

545
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:18,078
- I'm buying her.
- Cool, man.

546
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:21,915
- She's beautiful, huh?
- That's right.

547
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:27,963
Don't you know somebody over there
at Deerpark Casino in Connecticut...

548
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:31,466
...run by the Mohonk tribe?
Yeah, Marty, my niece's husband.

549
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:34,469
This Columbus Day protest,
we need to make it go away.

550
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,722
What's wrong with freedom of speech?

551
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:39,808
You should hear my kid.
He calls Columbus a murderer.

552
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:42,602
- They wiped out my people.
- Cubans are from Spain.

553
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:46,773
Strictly speaking, they were Taino
Indians who got raped by Columbus.

554
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,400
That's right, Reuben.

555
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:50,485
Melanzane got Martin Luther King Day.

556
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:53,071
- I have sympathy for the red man.
- Why is that?

557
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:56,616
Jews, because of their history,
have common cause with the oppressed.

558
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:59,995
Some Indians were deliberately
given blankets tainted with smallpox.

559
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,246
Died like flies.

560
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:03,123
- No shit?
- Yeah, shit.

561
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:06,668
Yeah? You wanna talk
bioterrorism? Look who started it.

562
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:09,296
- Amen to that, my friend.
- That's right.

563
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:12,299
Christopher Columbus was
no better than Adolf Hitler.

564
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,926
Back up. Hitler?

565
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:17,012
Yeah. I'm not the only one
who thinks so.

566
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:20,807
Yeah, that Indian from the protest
who was whining about the wilderness...

567
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:23,477
...they had him on TV
and he called Columbus Hitler.

568
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:26,354
- Because it's true, man.
- You're talking out of your ass.

569
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:29,775
Columbus and Hitler?
You're trivializing the Holocaust.

570
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:33,153
Frankly, Reuben, if you got that kind
of covert anti-Semitism...

571
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,988
...I'd like you to leave my house.

572
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:37,115
- Anti-Semitism?
- That's right.

573
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,950
Fuck you too, my man!

574
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:42,537
Guys, come on. Reuben, Hesh,
you guys have been friends for years.

575
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:55,300
I'll call Marty up in Connecticut.
He knows a big Mohonk.

576
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:58,178
That cocksucker.

577
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:02,557
We're not tired.
I didn't spill food because I'm tired.

578
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:05,560
Don't argue, okay? Listen
to your Aunt Grace and Aunt Mary.

579
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:07,938
Do what they say.

580
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:16,947
- Say good night to your Aunt Carmela.
- Good night, Aunt Carmela.

581
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:21,243
- It's great your family could come.
- They're leaving tomorrow.

582
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:25,455
- Somebody's sick up there.
- Dad? Dad?

583
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,834
(PHONE RINGING)

584
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:35,715
Dad, Sophia locked the door.

585
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:36,925
Should I get that?

586
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:39,719
He takes all my pencils.

587
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:49,688
- Baccalieri residence.
- Carmela, is that you?

588
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,690
- It's Corrado.
- Oh, hello.

589
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:55,277
How's my boy Bobby doing? He
knows I couldn't make it to the services.

590
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:58,905
- All right. He's upstairs with the kids.
- What a heartbreak, huh?

591
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:03,076
You know, I remember the first time
I met her like it was yesterday.

592
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:06,705
It was my birthday dinner
at Roman Gardens. I'll never forget it.

593
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:09,291
She said I looked like Pablo Picasso.

594
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:11,918
And I didn't even know
what Picasso looked like.

595
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:15,589
One day she showed me a picture
of him, and you know, she was right.

596
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:17,632
That's very touching.
Let me get Bobby.

597
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:21,094
I just wanna know if he's gonna pick
me up for court tomorrow.

598
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:24,764
Maybe you should let Bobby be. Think
about his needs instead of your own.

599
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:27,267
It's not me.
Please, don't villainize me here.

600
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:32,314
Murf goes to bed early, so I wanted to
call him now if I need him to drive me.

601
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:36,943
I don't wanna disturb him when he's
asleep. He's an old man, for God's sakes.

602
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:49,414
(CAR HONKING)

603
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:55,795
Stella!

604
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:58,673
What the fuck are you doing?

605
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:02,510
We don't have to hide, baby.

606
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:04,596
I did it!

607
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:06,139
I told Ro.

608
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:09,476
- Told her about us?
- No. No, no, no.

609
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:14,147
I told her I didn't wanna be
with her anymore, and I left!

610
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:30,205
Now I can devote myself
to you completely.

611
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:33,667
Now there can be no more fear...

612
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:36,336
...no more guilt.

613
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,632
- Just sex.
- Yeah. Yeah.

614
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:45,387
- You know what I want.
- Yeah, you want it all, don't you?

615
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:51,518
Oh, yeah. You need me, slut.

616
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:54,187
I need it all, baby.

617
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,190
Oh, shit!

618
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:00,986
Oh, shit, tonight's my night. I gotta
bring food over to Bobby Bacala's.

619
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:05,031
You're on ziti patrol too?
Ro's got Thursdays.

620
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,492
Well, what should I do?

621
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,001
(LAUGHS)

622
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:19,129
You could do me a solid, Tony.

623
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:21,756
Next time you see Hesh, remind him...

624
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:26,553
...my granddaughter's bat mitzvah
present doesn't really work.

625
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:30,640
The bubble jet printer.
I don't like to keep hocking him.

626
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,642
He knows about it.

627
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,561
He said he lost the sales slip.

628
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:37,856
So, Marty, where is this guy?

629
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:41,568
There he is. What'd I say?
Right on cue.

630
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:44,863
Chief!

631
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:47,073
- Where, behind the preppy guy?
- That's him.

632
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:55,248
Chief, I'd like to introduce you to my
friends, Silvio Dante, Tony Soprano.

633
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,751
The guy I was telling you about.

634
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,252
Chief Doug Smith.

635
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:03,923
Tribal chairman of the Mohonk Indians
and CEO of Mohonk Enterprises.

636
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,885
- An honor.
- Thanks for coming all the way here.

637
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:09,387
I had business in Manhattan anyway.

638
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,097
Not again.

639
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:14,476
Would you bring the gentleman
a Ketel One up, please?

640
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:20,607
So, chief, he told you about the shit
going down in Newark?

641
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,151
Small element, ruins it for the rest of us.

642
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:27,489
I've got a quarter-billion-dollar casino
and a huge Italian-American customer base.

643
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,616
Providence, East Boston.
Good people.

644
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,577
Our part of the world.
We're closer than Atlantic City.

645
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:35,789
This is a brand-new facility,
state of the art.

646
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:39,209
This fucking protest, they're burning
Columbus in effigy down there.

647
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:42,837
- They're gonna lay down in the parade.
- That's not gonna happen.

648
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:46,508
People like Redclay, they're out of touch.
They're in their ivory towers.

649
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:50,637
They don't understand the economic
opportunity that funds the community.

650
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:53,473
You should see the Olympic-size
swimming pool...

651
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:57,310
...this man put in the Deerpark
Reservation Rec Center.

652
00:39:58,145 --> 00:39:59,854
Well, we all got kids.

653
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:03,441
We don't want to see
our heritage attacked, that's all.

654
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:06,986
Salute.

655
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:13,618
Well, no offense, chief, but
you don't look much like an Indian.

656
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:16,371
Frankly, I passed most
of my life as white...

657
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:19,457
...until I had an awakening
and discovered my Mohonk blood.

658
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:23,211
My grandmother on my father's side,
her mother was a quarter Mohonk.

659
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:25,964
This happened when the casino bill
got passed, right?

660
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:29,134
- Better late than never.
- "Mohonk" if you love Columbus.

661
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:36,850
Sorry I didn't make it last night.

662
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:39,519
My Bible group had a potluck
for the homeless...

663
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,689
...and I was on clean-up crew, so...

664
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:45,525
Food, food, like that solves
all the world's problems.

665
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,193
Bobby, we've been neighbors.

666
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:52,699
I know that we don't talk much,
but if you want to, I'm here for you.

667
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,798
What is it?

668
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,721
That day...

669
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,558
...when she had the accident...

670
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:21,603
...I was stuck in traffic.

671
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:26,399
My son called because Karen wanted me
to pick up steaks and eggplants.

672
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:29,194
And I was mad at her for sending me.

673
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:31,571
I was tired.

674
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,241
I was mad at her.

675
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:39,412
But I was stuck in traffic
because of her accident.

676
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:44,083
She was up the road ahead of me
lying in twisted metal.

677
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:47,212
But I didn't know,
and I could've been with her.

678
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:50,215
I should've been there to help her.

679
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,927
But I was mad at her.

680
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:58,765
Oh, my sweet Karen.

681
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:01,768
My sweet girl.

682
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,944
Pass me the peppers.

683
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,618
Hello?

684
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:22,288
Oh, yeah, just a second.

685

Ton, it's the Indian chief.

686
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:38,680
- Doug, how are you?
- Tony, I wish I had better news.

687
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:40,974
I struck out.
Redclay didn't go for it.

688
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:44,269
Ask about the Iron Eyes Cody thing.

689
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:47,438
Pretended he didn't know me.
You believe the son of a bitch?

690
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,857
Ask him about Cody.

691
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:52,652
- You ask about Iron Eyes Cody?
- He didn't give a shit.

692
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,362
It was some Internet rumor.

693
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,781
Most Native Americans,
they don't give a fuck.

694
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:58,992
It's like knowing James Caan
isn't Italian.

695
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:03,204
All right, well, it was nice meeting you,
and I appreciate the effort.

696
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:06,291
You gotta let me make it up to you.
Come on up, spend a day.

- Sure, that sounds good.
- Great.

699
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:16,801
What the fuck did he say
about Iron Eyes Cody?

700
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:18,344
Ralphie had it all fucked up.

701
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:21,222
It don't mean nothing anyway,
because it's like knowing...

702
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:24,017
...James Caan isn't Italian.

703
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:35,236
We think this guy Redclay's
fucking a graduate student.

704
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:38,531
- We hire a detective...
- I think it's over, Sil.

705
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:41,701
- Yeah, but all we gotta...
- It's over.

706
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:48,875
He had just lost his wife.

707
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:52,045
And he had so much sadness, you know?

708
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:57,425
So much love for her,
such complete and pure emotion.

709
00:43:57,593 --> 00:44:00,219
I felt unworthy to even be
in his presence.

710
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:04,098
I was so moved by him.

711
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,727
And then I look at Ralphie.

712
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:12,857
You saw in this man the things
that you want in your life.

713
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:15,568
Truth.

714
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:18,404
- Love.
- Yes.

715
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:20,573
Somehow I have to find a way...

716
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:24,035
...to move away from the darkness
and toward the light.

717
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:25,536
What does this man do?

718
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:28,873
He works with my brother,
but he's not like the others.

719
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,918
Sandy, he's different, believe me.

Okay.

721
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:37,715
But back to Ralph.

722
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:42,428
You've got to sit him down
and level with him.

723
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:44,389
Speak the truth, Jan.

724
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:51,062
But with the compassion and respect that
you're famous for. And say goodbye.

725
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,606
For his sake as well as yours.

726
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:57,402
You're right.

727
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:00,279

Whenever I'm in these places I remember
my grandmother was part Fugahwe.

735
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:30,351
Maybe I should do something about it.

736
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:33,604
- Bullshit.
- No, no, it's true.

737
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:36,315
They were a nomadic tribe,
and they wander around...

738
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:39,110
...they get lost and they go,
"Where the Fugahwe?"

739

Buy you a drink?

Yeah, sure.

Okay.

- The statement's up in my bedroom.
- Oh, that's okay, I trust you.
