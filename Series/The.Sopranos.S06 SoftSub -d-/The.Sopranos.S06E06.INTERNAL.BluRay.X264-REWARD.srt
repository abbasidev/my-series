- I'm laying out. You coming?
- The UV index is 10.

Jesus, we don't do anything.
We don't eat.

9

We don't go out.
God knows we don't do anything else.

10
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:13,025
Is that all you
ever think about, sex?

11
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:16,695
All I ever think about?
You haven't fucked me in over a year.

12
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:20,199
Blood sugar, I told you,
the weight loss.

Good, fine.

Thing we talked
about at the wedding.

Rusty.

17
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,471
You made the call to Italy.

18
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,973
Our friend over there's
gonna fit him for a suit.

19
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:47,226
She's sending over
two of her best tailors.

20
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,353
So I should meet 'em
at the airport?

21
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,897
No, they're gonna call
you when they arrive.

22
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,816
Now you hook 'em up
with a third party, huh?

23
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:57,027
Get 'em some scissors.

24
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:01,198
This is smart, Ton',
the more I think about it.

25
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,783
Glad you approve.

26
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:05,661
Anybody taking a look,
there's nothing linking us to it.

27
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,663
- Hey, good seeing you.
- Hey, there he is.

28
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,374
- How you doing?
- What's up?

29
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,418
How are you?

30
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,629
Listen, come here a minute.

31
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,424
About the other day...

32
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,426
I'm fine.
A couple of stitches.

33
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:25,097
Yeah? My fucking
temper, you know?

34
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,224
No, no, no, no,
it's okay, really.

35
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,601
Take it.

36
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:32,145
Thanks.

37
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:33,939
Look, Ton',

38
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,358
I don't remember slamming
the refrigerator door,

39
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,777
but Carlo told me and my dad,

40
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:42,948
I never should have raised my hands
to you. I'm sorry.

41
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,659
As long as you realize.

42
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,328
Huh?

43
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:51,206
It basically became
the same thing every day.

44
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:53,542
Coffee, couple lines of meth,

45
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,962
smooth that out
with a shot of Jameson.

46
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,257
And that was just
to drive the kids to school.

(LAUGHING)

48
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:07,264
Then one day I fell asleep at work
and forgot about Gracie's recital.

49
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:15,605
Human frailty, it makes
me sick sometimes.

50
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:24,948
- Chris, right?
- Should I know you?

51
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:27,492
Kevin Mucci, Yonkers.

52
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,078
We met at the Trotters.
Sal lacuzzo's cousin.

53
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:31,830
- Right. Hey.
- Hey.

54
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,457
Yonkers, what are you, lost?

55
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:36,251
My ex's birthday over
at the Red Robin in Clifton.

56
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:37,878
I figured I'd need a meeting
to make it through that shit.

57
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,297
I hear that.

58
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,341
So I saw my cousin this week.

59
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:46,386
It turns out he ran into a friend
of yours, the big guy, Vito.

60
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:48,847
And...

61
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:52,684
He was in a fag bar,
dancing with a guy.

62
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,687
Get the fuck out!

63
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:11,620
- Right, Joey, use your head.
- (LAUGHING)

64
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,747
You are not gonna
fucking believe this.

65
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:16,041
Vito Spatafore's an ass-muncher.

66
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,794
- Oh! What?
- What did you just say?

67
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,504
I'm sorry, it's true.

68
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:24,966
We ran into this kid. Vito was spotted
in a fag bar in New York.

69
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:26,885
By who?

70
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,180
The kid's cousin.
Allegedly.

71
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:31,890
Probably bullshit.

72
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,434
- He's a married man.
- With a goomar.

73
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,561
All right, back up a second.

74
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,563
What did the kid say exactly?

75
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:42,442
- The kid's cousin Sal lacuzzo...
- From Yonkers, I know him.

76
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,530
Sal was at this place in the city,
supposedly on business.

77
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:49,408
He saw Vito holding hands
with a guy in nipple rings.

78
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,535
You're leaving out
the best part.

79
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,747
He was wearing
a motorcycle outfit,

80
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,333
like the guy in the Village People
with the leather hat

81
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,336
- and the vest.
- Chaps too.

82
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,884
I don't know.
Fucking slander, ask me.

83
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:11,805
All right, let's take this
in the back.

84
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:15,517
- Yeah, that's what Vito did.
- You can go.

85
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:21,940
Tell you one thing, if it was me this
kid was spreading rumors about,

86
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,859
he'd have something up
his own ass.

87
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,652
And it wouldn't be
no cock, either.

88
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,988
That's the point, though.

89
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,198
This guy Sal, I know him.

90
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:34,244
- He's a friend of ours.
- I fucking called it, long time ago.

91
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:36,371
You knew Vito was a recchion'?

92
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,123
- Yes.
- When?

93
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,041
I never said it, but I knew.

94
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:42,127
Get the fuck out.
Enough of this rush to judgment.

95
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:45,255
For all we know, this fucking Sal guy's
got a hard-on for Vito.

96
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:46,465
(LAUGHING)

97
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,675
Oh, you think
this is funny, huh?

98
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,886
There's a man's reputation
at stake here.

99
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,554
A married man, with kids.

100
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,891
Nah, that don't mean shit.
Elton John was married.

101
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:58,393
Yeah, Rock Hudson too.
I think.

102
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:02,481
So what do we gotta do, Ton',
actually see him take it in the ass?

103
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,817
Get Vito on the phone.

104
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,990
You know, he called me
the other night.

105
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,159
3:00 in the morning,
after the wedding.

106
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,911
And?

107
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:19,331
Honestly, it was weird.
He wanted to know what was going on.

108
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,125
He was fucking fishing,
see if we heard.

109
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:26,296
Straight to voice mail.

110
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,548
Ton', I mean, he represents us.

111
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:30,550
I'm not gonna condemn
the man off the word

112
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,594
of some fucking douchebag
from Yonkers.

113
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:36,848
- I could care less, basically.
- Yeah? Maybe you're a flambe.

114
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,975
Fucking nauseating.

115
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:42,103
It was up to me, I'd drag Vito behind
my fucking car right now.

116
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:45,482
Will you take it easy over there,
fucking Judge Roy Bean?

117
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,776
One of my bar girls
knows his goomar.

118
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:51,363
We'll check with her. Maybe she's seen
him and knows where he is.

119
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,864
Loren.

120
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,872
Think about it, though, Ton'...

121
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,708
sudden weight loss.

122
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,836
- AIDS?
- Nobody's got AIDS.

123
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:10,465
I don't wanna hear
that word in here again!

124
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:15,720
The Federal Prosecutor's office won't
tell you why your son's being held?

125
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:19,224
Or where. It has been four days
now since he's been arrested,

126
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,476
and we have no money
to hire a lawyer.

127
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:24,062
- How did you hear about the law center?
- You will write the...

128
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,273
Habeas corpus?
I'm not an attorney yet.

129
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,359
I'm a volunteer assistant.
One of our attorneys will file the writ.

130
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:33,196
- He is a good boy.
- The FBI went to his school

131
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,740
and took him like a criminal.
This is America?

132
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,493
It's not easy to be Muslim now.

133
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,704
They wouldn't let Afaf skate
at the local rink

134
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:44,124
- unless she removed her headscarf.
- You're kidding me, why?

135
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,126
They said it was for insurance.

136
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,128
It might fall off
and someone could trip.

137
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:51,381
If she had been wearing a yarmulke,
it would have been a different story.

138
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,425
You can bet.

139
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,304
They're these poor,
hardworking people.

140
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:59,681
- Finn, you're not eating?
- Coffee's good.

141
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,225
The government is just completely
fucking this family over.

142
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,603
When did it start she could use that
kind of language

143
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,521
in this house with immunity?

144
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,316
I'm telling Mom about these people
that came in yesterday.

145
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:12,777
Let me guess, was it a crack
whore trying to get her kids back

146
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,446
for the welfare money?

147
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,157
Actually, it was a family from
Afghanistan who fled the Taliban

148
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,992
and sweated out visa lotteries

149
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,621
in a refugee camp,
and hold down three jobs.

150
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:26,166
You think it's funny? The FBI
snatched their son off the street

151
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,460
like we're some
third-world dictatorship.

152
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,836
Pretty scary.

153
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,755
There must have
been some reason, Meadow.

154
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,965
- Like he's a terrorist, maybe.
- 9-11, 9-11.

155
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:37,427
Bush is using it as an excuse to erode
our Constitutional protections,

156
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:40,805
- and you're falling for it.
- Well, I voted for him.

157
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:45,143
Right, well, you don't
relate to black people clinging to logs.

158
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,816
You oughta chill out
about some of this.

159
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,158
Hey.

160
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,917
Let me ask you something,

161
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:12,045
those two Arabs

162
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:15,507
with the credit cards,
Fazool and whatever his name is...

163
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:16,883
Yeah?

164
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:20,387
You think there's a chance
they could be...

165
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:23,098
I don't know, Al-Qaedas,
something like that?

166
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,935
Hmm.

167
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:30,980
You know, at one point
it did cross my mind.

168
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,774
Yeah, and?

169
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,110
I don't think so.

170
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:37,696
They're gun nuts
but the smaller guy Ahmed,

171
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,864
when those Danish cartoons

00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,927
What happened?

347
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:39,263
Bob at the marina
where Tony docks his boat

348
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,807
says he'll donate
a sunset dinner cruise.

349
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,767
- I paid $300 for that?
- Yeah.

350
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:46,312
I got seasick in Bermuda
on one of those.

351
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:48,606
- Oh, Angie, finally.
- Sorry.

352
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,274
I had these sales reps
in my office.

353
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,818
We're just going over
the list for the silent auction.

354
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:56,655
- We're already up to about 7500 bucks.
- Oh good, Artie.

355
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:59,533
- Ladies.
- A silent auction again?

356
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:03,370
- Why not get a live auctioneer?
- I got sea bream, beautiful.

357
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:05,581
Porcini-dusted ravioli, huh?

358
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:08,042
I hate to be a pain,
but I gotta get back.

359
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:09,960
- Can we just let him cook?
- Sure.

360
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:12,171
Great, go for it.

361
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,341
Where were we?

362
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:18,344
Jesus Christ.
He's always interrupting.

363
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:20,554
People enjoy the silent auction.

364
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,473
I thought our goal
was to raise money.

365
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:26,185
I say we get 'em liquored up, let 'em
tear each other's throats out.

366
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:30,022
- Well...
- It's just an idea.

367
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:33,984
Anyhow, put me down for $2,000
worth of bodywork and/or paint.

368
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:36,195
2,000? Madonn', Ange.

369
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:40,282
So, did you hear about
Vito and Marie? Separated.

370
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,910
(PHONE VIBRATES)
Oh, sorry, I gotta take this.

371
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:45,663
Hello?

372
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,581
They were just at the wedding.
They seemed fine.

373
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:50,125
What'd I tell you?
Is that a beautiful fish or what?

374
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:52,419
Oh, for God's sake, all right!

375
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:55,255
Can I just get some
prosciutto melon to go?

376
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,508
I'm sorry, guys.
I gotta get back.

377
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:02,554
No, the quarter panel
from the LeSabre, I said.

378
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,890
(WHISPERS)
Oh shit.

379
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,809
You didn't know he was gay?

380
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:14,525
Actually I had him pegged
the whole time, but...

381
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:18,195
He a close friend?

382
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:20,531
Not only that, he's one
of my most valuable guys.

383
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,991
He's ambitious, he's focused.

384
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,703
When I was in the hospital,

385
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,997
he helped Carmela
tremendously when we were strapped.

386
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:33,210
You've implied you have
millions of dollars.

387
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:36,547
Your hospital stay
was actually that costly?

388
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:40,050
Well, no, but, uh...

389
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,678
Huh?

390
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:45,055
Is that the issue?

391
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:48,851
You tell me.
What is the issue?

392
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,687
He's a fag!

393
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,480
And?

394
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,149
Now what am I supposed to do?

395
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:57,192
About what?

396
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,236
I know what.
They're born that way, right?

397
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:02,072
It's not their fault.

398
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:05,159
Frankly I think they
go about in pity for themselves.

399
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:08,537
I don't think they
see it as a fault.

400
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,873
In your circle I'm sure
you got all kinds

401
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:14,251
of gays and trans-whatevers

402
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:15,919
of all stripes.

403
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,005
But not where I come from.

404
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:22,509
You personally...

405
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:25,596
how do you feel
about homosexuality?

406
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:27,973
I find it disgusting.

407
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:32,102
Men kissing men,
holding hands in the street.

408
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:37,107
Every fuckin' TV show now,
they rub your nose on it.

409
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,736
Although, that...

410
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:43,489
the lesbian thing
with the, uh...

411
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:45,866
Jennifer Beals,

412
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:48,076
it's not bad.

413
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:51,789
She a dyke in real life?

414
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:55,000
I don't give too much of a shit

415
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,794
what people do
behind closed doors

416
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:59,963
with the consenting adults.

417
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:04,051
Although don't forget:
I'm a strict Catholic.

418
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:07,596
I agree with that
Senator Sanitorium,

419
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,807
who says if we let
this stuff go too far,

420
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:12,142
pretty soon we'll
be fucking dogs.

421
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,061
I hear a lot of ambivalence.

422
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:20,484
This guy that got outed, look,

423
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:22,945
the guys that work for me
are asking for head.

424
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,907
His head.
What the fuck?

425
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:31,829
You know, him and me,
we're in the construction business.

426
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:35,123
Now some of these
union old-timers, the contractors,

427
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,918
they're not gonna want
to be seen with him.

428
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:41,171
And I'm talking huge deals,
major fucking dollars.

429
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:47,177
A lot of your circle
must have done jail time.

430
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:51,974
They can't be strangers
to male-male sexual contact.

431
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,312
You get a pass for that.

432
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,858
Well, that's nice.

433
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:04,027
Well, what are you gonna do?

434
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:06,363
There's no women there.

435
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:10,200
You're there five, 10 years.

436
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:17,708
Just for the record, my incarceration
was very short-term,

437
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:20,002
so I never had any need
for any anal... you know.

438
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:26,675
So this fellow who's been outed,
what's he saying?

439
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,636
You think I'm lying, don't you?

440
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:32,222
About when I was in jail.

441
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:35,726
I've given you no indication
I think you're lying.

442
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:49,740
What the fuck, I suppose
something inside me says

443
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,200
God bless, a' salut'.

444
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,620
Who gives a shit?

445
00:31:57,415 --> 00:32:00,667
I mean, I had a second chance.
Why shouldn't he?

446
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:03,170
Part of your new outlook?

447
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:05,923
Maybe.

448
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,092
I salute it, then.

449
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,429
Tall fuckin' order,
I'll tell you that.

450
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,097
How so?

451
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:18,310
You can talk about every day being
a gift and stopping to smell the roses,

452
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:22,522
but regular life's got a way
of picking away at it.

453
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:25,442
Your house, the shit you own,

454
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,527
it drags you down.

455
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:29,821
Your kids, what they want.

456
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,866
One bad idea after another.

457
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:38,497
Just trying to work a cell phone menu
is enough to make you scream.

458
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:43,627
There's some cold pasta.

459
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:46,588
No, I ate already.

460
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,465
What's all that?

461
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,469
For the silent auction.

462
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,471
My busy little beaver.

463
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:57,307
Not really.

464
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:02,396
Look, Ton', I haven't
wanted to bug you,

465
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:04,648
but before you'd gotten hurt,

466
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,858
you said you would get
that building inspector

467
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:09,444
to cut me some slack
so I could get back to my business?

468
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:12,656
Oh yeah, right, right.
I will, later.

469
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,368
Come here.

470
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:21,164
No, uh, I'm still not
ready for that.

471
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:25,293
Last time I thought I tore something
from tensing my muscles.

472
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,673
No, I got something
for that scar.

473
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,344
Oh.

476
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:51,486
My facialist said
it will help get the red out.

477
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,870
You were right
about my uncle, Carm.

478
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,457
All along.

479
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:07,002
It doesn't give me
any pleasure, believe me.

480
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:10,881
I should have cut him
out of my life.

481
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,092
I brought this all on myself.

482
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:18,430
You did not.
Don't ever think that.

483
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:26,063
All this, you never once
said "I told you so."

484
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:31,401
Accentuate the positive.

485
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,324
I wanted you to get better.

486
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:44,456
You know my shrink...

487
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:48,919
told me that, uh...

488
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:53,298
I stood by Junior through
all his jealousy and shit...

489
00:34:56,385 --> 00:35:00,847
trying to prove
I'm a good guy...

490
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:07,312
and that my mother couldn't
hate a good boy like that.

491
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:14,111
Imagine laying
next to a guy 15 years

492
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,696
and all the time he's been playing for
the pink team.

493
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:19,366
Who told you?
Tony swore me to secrecy.

494
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:20,826
I'm not gonna burn my sources.

495
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:22,828
Anyway, it's all over the place.

496
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:27,582
Those children... imagine when they
find out their father's a finook.

497
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,252
God, she's such a bright girl,
Marie Spatafore.

498
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,337
You think she and Vito
had some arrangement?

499
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,381
I just hope she
gets herself tested.

(GASPS AND SIGHS)

501
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:40,428
Still, Vito? He'd be like the last
one you'd suspect.

502
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,390
Suspect of what?

503
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:46,017
Wow, such a young lady!

504
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:47,769
Yes, she's working two jobs.

505
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:51,565
Days she's interning at Gendler,
Lookstein, Abruzzo & Abruzzo.

506
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:53,483
What about Vito?

507
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:57,237
Nothing. Him and Marie
are having some problems, that's all.

508
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:02,742
- I can probably guess.
- Excuse me?

509
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:05,203
Huh-uh, I'm not going first.

510
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,122
Do you know something?

511
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,921
Okay...

512
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:18,884
he is possibly...

513
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:20,677
gay.

514

When Dad got him that job

in a car going down on some
security guard.

519
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:34,274
- Oh my God!
- He saw this?

520
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:36,610
He had Finn all freaked out.
He still does.

521
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:38,236
Why didn't you say something?

522
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:41,031
Because Vito warned Finn not to.

523
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:45,160
(TONY SINGING)

524
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,370
You gotta hear
what Meadow just told us.

525
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,414
- Mom!
- The cat's out of the bag, Meadow.

526
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:58,215
Oh, it's "Dr. Yank 'em,"
the painless dentist.

527
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,884
How you doing, kid?
Hey Ton'.

528
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,345
Hey...

(LAUGHING)

530
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,766
Unfortunately, Finn here
has got some bad news,

531
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:10,101
so, uh, listen up.

532
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:11,895
Sit down.

533
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:15,106
Go ahead.

534
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:17,067
Tell 'em what you saw.

535
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:26,243
Don't be scared.
It's all right.

536
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,722
All right, if we can just
head over and have lunch.

537
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,140
Good morning.

538
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:05,740
Good morning.

539
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,478
Let me ask you a question.

540
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:38,315
Before he cornered you
in the porta-potty,

541
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:40,984
when the security guard
was sucking him off...

542
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,445
Whoa, one sec, it was
the other way around.

543
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:45,780
What?

544
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:50,076
Vito was blowing
the security guard.

545
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:52,662
Son of a bitch!

546
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:55,832
Catchin', not pitchin'?

547
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,463
He's not gonna know I told you?

548
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:04,549
You ain't gonna have
no problem from Vito, believe me.

549
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,969
- What are you gonna do?
- It'll be okay.

550
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,388
Get him to pay for some therapy.

551
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:14,184
Look, why don't you...
why don't you go out front,

552
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,644
get yourself a sandwich,

553
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,188
any kind you like, huh?

554
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:20,732
Soda.

555
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:24,194
When we're done here,
somebody will take you back.

(PATS FINN ON THE BACK)

557
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,197

Be a fuckin' honor.

Cut off his pisciatil'
and feed it to him.

There can be no mistake now.

563
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,549
I can't believe
I stuck up for him!

564
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,593
I feel like I've been
stabbed in the heart.

565
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,804
We can't have him here
in our social club no more.

566
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:52,305
I mean, that much I do know.

567

Social club?

568
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,517
He's gotta go!

569
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:57,977
I wanna think about it.

570
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,605
Yeah, I don't know.

571
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:03,400
What the fuck?
What is there to think about?

572
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:06,277
- Sit down.
- Fuck that! I'll say it again!

573
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,071
What the fuck is there
to think about?

574
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,366
You gonna take care
of his kids, huh, after he's gone?

575
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:16,788
It's true.
They didn't do nothing.

576

00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,252
Now sit down.

I'm sorry if I yelled, T.

betrayal can I take?

about "greasing the union,"

584
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,569
who knew that's what he meant?

- You poor kid.

00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:09,716
I know. I can't
believe it myself.

590

I keep waiting for him to call.

591
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:15,972
How long am I supposed
to tell the kids he's away on business?

I get my hands on him

limb from limb.

- You're my cousin he married,

But what do we really know?

I mean, maybe there
were signs, but...

599
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:38,119
Vito Spatafore is a good man,

600
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,829
and he's a wonderful dad.

and he's tossed aside like garbage?

That's why I'm here, honey.

603
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:52,634
There's been confirmation
through the grapevine.

604
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:56,346
Vito was seen
in a car with a man.

I don't want to get
graphic beyond that,

606

the idea of it
repulses me so much.

607
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,854
What confirmation?
Who?

no reason to lie.

No...

no more, much as we love him.

Where do you think
he might have gone, honey?

get him to do something about it.

you want, sweetheart,

- Carm, hi.

I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting something?

bodywork certificates for the auction.

- But if you're busy...

Okay, sure.

behind closed doors.

Well, you know Angie's
put money on the street.

How do you know?

627
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,843
- Angie told me.
- She didn't tell me.

628
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:18,261
Probably 'cause of Tony.

629
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:20,555
Aw, maybe he didn't want you
to know something like that.

630
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:23,433
Me and my big mouth.

631
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:27,228
She's got enough money
to do that, huh?

632
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:35,194
Well, she's pretty successful with that
body shop, so...

633
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:38,239
Our grandmothers did it.

634

Those were harder times,
but... a' salut', right?

635
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:47,248
She's one of us.
Now it's like she's one of them.

- You wanted to see me, Ton'?
- Yeah.

Listen, Ton'...

651
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:39,342
since you think enough of me
to give me this responsibility

652
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,511
I might as well be
the one to say it.

653
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,180
All right, skip the preambles.

654
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,308
The guys on Vito's crew,

655
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:49,310
they say if he was to come back,

656
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,062
they refuse to take
orders from him.

657
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:53,773
Oh, they do?

658
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:57,026
Not only that,

659
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:59,362
a couple of the other captains
won't talk to him,

660
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:02,865
and I don't disagree.

661
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:05,118
Paulie especially.

662
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:07,537
Now that he's
accepted it, hey...

663
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:09,997
he's the most out
for Vito's scalp.

664
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:14,836
Yeah, you should hear him, Ton'. He's
goin' fuckin' mau-mau on the subject.

665
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:19,549
It's not their fucking decision
who they work with.

666
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:23,010
Let me tell you something...

667
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:25,555
fuckin' Vito,
through sheer hard work,

668
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:27,306
turned himself
into my best earner.

669
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:30,893
I don't even know
if I'd have the new boat without him.

670
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:33,229
He's a come-from-behind
kind of guy.

671
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:35,398
That's true, but...

672
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:38,484
So I'm gonna burn
that kind of dedication?

673
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:40,570
It's hard to believe I couldn't get
something more out of him,

674
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,405
if he were to come back.

675
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:45,658
Stocks, offshore shit,
I don't know.

676
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:48,327
Well...

677
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:51,497
these other guys feel
an effort should be made

678
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:54,083
to find him and put him down
for the honor of the family.

679
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:56,627
Oh, please, huh?

680
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:59,088
You know, certain people,
they love the high drama,

681
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:02,341
like fuckin' high school girls.
And others I could name,

682
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:05,219
they just can't wait to
whack somebody, anybody.

683
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:09,515
But some people feel it's against
our principles, Tony.

684
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:11,559
A sin.

685
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:17,440
Carlo, let's be honest
with ourselves here.

686
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:19,317
We all know Vito's
not the first.

687
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,743
Well...

688
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:31,829
we're gonna do great things.

689
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:35,625
Aw, Jesus, thanks again, Anthony.
Thank you.

690
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:10,409
What?

It's 2006.

692
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:18,626
There's pillow biters
in the Special Forces.

693
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:22,964
Let me just ask you, Ton'...

694
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:25,800
sake of argument.

695
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:28,469
Let's say he shows up.

696
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:32,265
You gonna kiss this guy
on both cheeks?

697
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:36,435
Take Paulie, okay?

698
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:38,813
You know perfectly well

699
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:43,734
guys like him never kick up their full
percent to you.

700
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:45,862
You look the other way,

price of doing business.

702
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:54,245
But you cut Vito slack now
that he's out of the closet,

703
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:57,999
just the excuse people need
to go off the reservation

704
00:47:58,166 --> 00:48:01,210
and start withholding
serious money.

705
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:07,216
Let me read in peace, will you?

706
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,013
Having fun with all this paper?

707
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,348
I can't believe
this is just one case.

I'm the lead attorney on this mess.

Oh.
Meadow Soprano.

- I'm Michael Kardish. I work with Rae.
- Hi.

711
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,190
Ms. Soprano came
highly recommended.

713
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:28,988
This is really interesting too.

714
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:32,116
Of course it's different than the kind
of thing we see at the law center.

715
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:33,910
Clients there are so
trampled and abused...

716
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:35,912
Welcome to white-collar fraud.

717
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:39,081
I need the e-mails from box 44
and 45, July and August.

718
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:41,250
Pull them and leave them
with my assistant.

Building my lats back up.

723
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:05,775
Did you by any chance talk to
the building inspector about my house?

724
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:08,110
Shit, I forgot.

725
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:24,293
The sorting's tedious,
but some of the cases...

726
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:26,003
this guy was
pretty clever, really.

727
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:28,255
He set up all these
phony investment firms

728
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:30,007
and then just siphoned
the money out:

729
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:32,051
- $80 million.
- Whoa.

730
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:34,136
Yeah, he's out on bail.

731
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,682
Then you look at
my father's friend,

732
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:39,183
federal marshals dragging him

733
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:40,851
out of his own
daughter's wedding.

734
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:42,353
He hasn't even been tried yet.

735
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:44,981
You're innocent in this
country until proven guilty.

736
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:47,441
Yeah, but Johnny Macaroni
was indicted for murder.

737
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:50,319
They couldn't let him
stay 15 more minutes?

You better put your pants on.

740
00:49:57,744 --> 00:49:59,620
You know why they did that?

741
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:01,789
To humiliate him
in front of everyone.

my father with the shoes?

744
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:07,670
It was pure harassment.

745
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:10,006
Yeah, but the guy's lucky
they even let him out.

746
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:14,260
Oh, so white-collar criminals
can destroy people's lives

747
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:17,471
and steal their pensions
and it's no big deal to you.

You know what?
Bad subject.

749
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:22,685
Let's talk about something else.

750
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,520
No, let's talk about it

751
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:26,564
so we can stop
with the "macaroni" cracks.

752

Weird, since you're
part Italian yourself.

is so deracinated.

Yeah, the way he prefers it.
All those hysterical jokes

755

about Italian cheeses
and smelly feet.

Why are you picking a fight?

I'm not, but you're slamming my family.

It's amazing.

You weren't there for
the "grand inquisition" about Vito.

761
00:50:57,262 --> 00:51:00,139
I knew it.
I'm picking the fight.

going to happen to Vito for being gay?

of the Mezzogiorno" bullshit.
