00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,809
What are you doing up so early?

6
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:26,103
I couldn't sleep.

7
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,695
You want breakfast?

8
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,488
- Yeah, all right.
- Anthony.

9
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:39,074
- What?
- I am making French toast.

10
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:42,828
I'm not hungry. Jesus,
how many times you gonna ask me?

11
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:46,498
You've heard the term comfort food.
Maybe it'll make you feel better.

12
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,042
This is hard for you to believe...

13
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,587
...but food may not be
the answer to every problem.

14
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,797
Neither is acting
like a whiny little bitch.

15
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:57,342
- Tony.
- I'll eat at work, okay?

16
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,761
My shitty-ass pizza job.

17
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:02,222
If it's so horrible, take a day off.

18
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,100
My fiancée left me.

19
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:07,686
That job is all I have in my life.

20
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,023
It's better to have loved and lost, A.J.

21
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:14,067
- What?
- It is.

(TV TURNS OFF)

23
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:30,042
I feel bad for him, but what the fuck?
Why's he gotta take it out on us?

24
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,881
I'm looking for a miter saw.

25
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:39,426
I got the Makita,
carbide blade, laser guide.

26
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:42,971
- Lists for six, 200.
- Sold.

27
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:44,973
- Mike, you got that? The Makita.
- Yeah.

28
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:47,392
Cheese it. It's the off-duty cops.

29
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,686
You know my son-in-law Chris,
the movie producer?

30
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:51,730
- How you doing?
- Let me know about that ticket.

31
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,691
- It's squashed, forget it.
- Thanks.

32
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,401
How you doing?
How's my little girl?

33
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,363
- Good. You coming Sunday, right?
- Yeah. Two o'clock, she said.

34
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,739
Here, that's for you.

35
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,158
Tell your friend Paulie
to keep these power tools coming.

36
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:10,457
Madon,
flying off the shelves, huh?

37
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:14,753
You ain't seen this many cops lined up
since the centennial of Dunkin' Donuts.

38
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:16,380
They're all handymen.

39
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:19,675
They got side jobs so they can afford
those 18-foot bass boats.

40
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:23,053
Cataldo, that state trooper, he's putting
a drop ceiling in my basement.

41
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:24,680
- Thanks, sweetie.
- Sure.

42
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:31,270
Twelve K in there. I took my cut.
I'm seeing Al again next week.

43
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,814
- To business.
- You're gonna jinx me?

44
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,357
Toast with water?

45
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,609
It's club soda. What's your problem?

46
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:41,655
You got the problem, my friend.
You're a real fucking drip lately.

47
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,658
When I was using, I was a disgrace.
Now I'm sober, I'm a drip.

48
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,369
- The fuck you want from me?
- How's about being normal?

49
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,621
- That so fucking hard?
- Actually, yeah, Paulie...

50
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,039
...for some of us it is.

51
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:54,293
Don't get cunty.
I'm breaking your balls.

52
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:02,884
What do you say we take a ride?
Little prime rib? On me.

53
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:05,846
Maybe next time.

54
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,723
You watching
your cholesterol now too?

55
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:11,059
Yeah, you're fucking hilarious.

56
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,746
Hey, Tony. What's the good word?

57
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:33,749
- Can't complain.
- Sure you could. Phil Leotardo.

58
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:39,254
My first assignment
out of the Academy was in Brooklyn.

59
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,298
Never cared for him.

60
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:45,886
He tried to set up this other rookie,
female, for rape and beating.

61
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,183
Listen, that subject we talked about...

62
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:56,563
...if I was to know something
possibly terror-related...

63
00:05:56,731 --> 00:06:00,567
...and help you out,
could I bank the resulting goodwill?

64
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:05,697
Well, what happens is...

65
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,408
...I would personally write you
what's called a 5K letter.

66
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:12,037
It's a document setting forth
your cooperation and service.

67
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,039
This letter would be placed
in your file...

68
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,458
...and if you were ever
convicted of a crime...

69
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,711
...it'd be presented to a judge...

70
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:24,132
...when he or she would be
considering sentencing guidelines.

71
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:35,727
Well, there were a couple of guys,
I don't know, Arabs, Arabians maybe.

72
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:39,314
They used to hang around the Bing,
and somebody I knew...

73
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,900
...may have did some business
with them.

74
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,236
At the port?

75
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,408
- You were saying.
- The point is, they used to be around...

76
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:53,954
...all the time, these two, drinking and
trying to tit-fuck the girls, whatever.

77
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:57,541
And then suddenly, they disappeared,
and I mean completely.

78
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,877
And then a week or so ago,
I'm driving, and I see them...

79
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,754
...with these other guys...

80
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:08,969
...with the headgear and the beard
and the whole fundamental bit.

81
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,264
But there's nothing
illegal there, right?

82
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,932
What were they doing?

83
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,227
Walking.

84
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:20,605
But then they meet up
with this other group and...

85
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:24,443
- I don't know, it seemed...
- You got a name?

86
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:28,447
One was named Ahmad
or Jamal or...

87
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,785
Hold on, hold on.

88
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:43,420
(CELL PHONE RINGS)

89
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,881
- Hey, T.
- Yeah, I'm here with some people...

90
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:49,301
...and the Arabs from the Bing,
what were their names?

91
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,636
- Some people?
- Exactly.

92
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:56,475
Oh, fuck, yeah,
Ahmed and Muhammed.

93
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,978
- What'd they do?
- Ahmed and Muhammed.

94
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,314
You know, actually,
I got a cell number.

95
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:06,276
I called him recently,
but he don't answer no more.

96
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:09,029
Ahmed al Najafi.

97
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:14,075
973-555-0146.

98
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,994
Ahmed al Najafi.

99
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:22,792
Tell me they're not gonna blow up
the chemical plant or some shit.

100
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,669
I don't know. I'll call you later.

101
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,342
- Cell phone.
- That's a real prize.

102
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,010
Thank you.

103
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:35,639
So finally I said:

104
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:38,433
"Okay, you know, as long as
you don't mind yesterday's pizza."

105
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,352
"No, no," he said, "it's cool."

106
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,147
So "great," I told him.
"Come back tomorrow."

107
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,524
You are so bad.

108
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,026
- Hey. Good.
- Hey, how you doing?

109
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,530
- They add your overtime?
- Yeah, thank you.

110
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,534
- Who's that?
- I don't know. Some guy.

111
00:08:56,202 --> 00:09:00,288
- What, are you going out with him?
- He smiled, Anthony. He works here.

112
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:03,542
- You gotta stop.
- Or what?

113
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,043
Or I won't see you again.

114
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,420
Like meeting me for coffee
is such a big deal.

115
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:10,173
Honestly, I don't even think
it's a good idea anyway.

116
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:13,093
- How come?
- Because last time you started crying...

117
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:16,221
...and had to leave the Starbucks.

118
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,936
I can't sleep at night
without you.

119
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:26,189
It'll get better, okay?

120
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,234
I love you so much.

121
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,236
I gotta go back to work.

122
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,781
Stop. You're embarrassing me.

123
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:48,587
You knock off early,
we go back to your place...

124
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,214
...christen those new sheets
you were telling me about.

125
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:55,969
- Man with the plan, huh?
- The man with the erection.

126
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,643
Let me take this.

127
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:06,771
- Hey.
- It's me.

128
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,940
I need you to come home. It's A.J.

129
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,151
- What happened?
- I am worried, Tony.

130
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,944
I have never seen him like this.

131
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,114
I have to meet the realtor
to see a new property...

132
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,782
...but I am afraid
to leave him alone.

133
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,952
- Afraid, why?
- Will you just come home, please?

134
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,377
Go away.

135
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:31,296
It's me.

136
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,719
What's the matter?

137
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,892
- What happened?
- You know what happened.

138
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,977
Blanca still.

139
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,190
All right, that's it. Enough's enough.

140
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,151
Look, I'm fucking depressed, okay?

141
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,820
You broke up.
How long you wanna cry about it?

142
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,822
She was my life.

143
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:02,035
You're 20 years old. You barely have
a life, and you're better off anyway.

144
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:05,664
She was cute, okay, but come on.
With another guy's kid to boot.

145
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,083
She was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

146
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:22,764
What you're going through,
what you're feeling right now...

147
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,724
...it happens sometimes.

148
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:28,103
Everybody gets the blues.

149
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:31,606
There's a half a billion dollar
industry devoted to it.

150
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:36,027
- What, Prozac?
- No, the music business.

151
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,905
They write thousands
of songs about this shit.

152
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:43,201
"Tears on My Pillow,"
"Mona Lisa," right?

153
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:50,208
Listen, these fucking women...

154
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:54,379
...they'll drive you nuts
with your emotions and whatnot.

155
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,507
And I know it feels like you're never
gonna love anybody again.

156
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:00,385
But trust me, there's millions
of girls out there...

157
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,722
...that are dying to meet a guy like you.
I see them every day.

158
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:07,308
- Oh, right, I'm so special.
- You're damn right you are.

159
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:10,979
You're handsome and smart
and a hard worker...

160
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:16,568
...and, let's be honest, white.
That's a huge plus nowadays.

161
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,280
Go out and get a blowjob.

162
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:24,576
- I don't want a blowjob.
- Keep your voice down.

163
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:29,247
- Why? Who's listening out there?
- Nobody.

164
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,083
Oh, fuck me!

165
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,918
You saw her again, didn't you?

166
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,630
I knew it.

167
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,257
I don't wanna talk about it.

168
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,927
I love you, Anthony.
It's killing me to see you like this.

What's the fucking point?

170
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:51,311
- Point of what?
- Just leave me alone.

171
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,204
Honestly, I was glad
when they broke up.

- Thank you so much for inviting us.
- Sure.

177

I'm so nervous cooking
for all these people.

Tony's sister Barbara?

- Of course.
- Hi, nice to see you.

- And the baby.

- Very sweet.

- Can I play the Xbox?
- What happened to folding the napkins?

185
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:51,329
- How you holding up?
- I'm totally freaking.

This is nice. About time
you invited everybody over.

196
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,511
It was Kelli's idea.
She's been wanting...

197
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,513
...to get her teeth wet
with the entertaining.

You've been like a ghost lately.

You're around one second,
next you're gone.

204
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,827
- I was by the Bing the other day.
- For like five minutes.

205
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:16,164
You of all people should understand
how hard it is...

206
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,790
...for me to be around that place.

207
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,668
- I should? Why?
- Because you're in therapy.

208

You understand
the human condition, at least.

209

- Turn those ribs.

Truth is, between the booze
and the strippers over there...

it's hard, you know?

and peppers without a cold one?

You want a beer, too bad.

- I got balls.

the problem with my mother.

- So my dad?

he had a crutch.

You fucking believe this?

I thought Paulie called you.

Molinaro to my father-in-law's store.

- Yeah.

while they were there.

So they did
or did not take the saws?

to talk to me about?
