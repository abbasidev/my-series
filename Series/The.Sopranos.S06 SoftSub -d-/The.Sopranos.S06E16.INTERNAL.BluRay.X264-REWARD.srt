it's to be expected, with Vito passing...

51
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,044
...and all that that entrailed.
I think the only solution...

52
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:17,631

- Phil.

is this my problem?

00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,634
- Get me a drink.
- Sure, alcohol, that's good for it.

340
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,886
Get one yourself.

341
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,848
It's not the fucking MSG.
It's Tony Soprano.

342
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:10,351
(SIGHS) You know, he really helped
when I was in the hospital.

343
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:13,479
- Never lend friends money, Eli.
- He still won't pay?

344
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,856
That's the least of it.

345
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:17,858
He's all worked up or something.

346
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:21,404
And I don't like the way he talks.
Hostile remarks.

347
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:23,698
It's not like him.

348
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:24,907
Makes me worry.

349
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:29,120
Yeah, I can see that.
What are you thinking?

350
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:33,499
Come on.
Tony's not gonna hurt you.

351
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:34,667
Yeah.

352
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,836
You've seen how
these Italians work.

353
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:39,380
For the most part, it's okay.

354
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,382
Get them cornered...

355
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,093
...you're dealing with nothing more
than an animal.

356
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:46,095
(CHUCKLES) What, do you think
he's gonna kill you now?

357
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:47,388
I don't fucking know.

358
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,684
He's the guy I call
to deal with people like him.

359
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:55,146
- He's a rich man. He'll pay.
- Minus assets...

360
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,773
...I'd say under six.

361
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:00,526
- Come on, he's a boss.
- I've known him a long time.

362
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,570
Money goes in one hand
and right out the other.

363
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:06,365
The more he makes,
the more he spends. That wife?

364
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:11,495
Eli, at what point
is it cheaper for him...

365
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,205
...to settle it another way?

366

from here on. Enjoy the Borgata.

Yeah, right. Time to go.

372
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:50,576
- Along with the chips.
- Yeah, we're up about 18.

I could go for a rib eye,

Oh, no kidding.
Why, because I'm up?

Give him a beer, anything.

with Hector's dad. I'm not like that.

because you always were a good kid.

There's no geographical solution
to an emotional problem, Marie.

Maine, wherever.

675
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:38,453
- Marie?
- Yeah?

676
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:43,416
I know it's hard,
but it's the best thing for him.

677
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:47,086
- Okay?
- Thank you, Tony.

678
00:41:57,556 --> 00:42:01,267
- Okay, just make sure you're done.
- I'm all over it, Tony.

Hey, Ton, isn't that...?
What's-their-names?

683
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,650
Used to hang out at the Bing.

684
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:04,163
- Wake up, Vito.
- What?

685
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:07,166
Vito, my name is Steve.
I'm here to help you.

686

You're gonna come
with us now, all right?

687

- Come on.
- Mom?

688
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:15,633
- No, let me go. No. Mom.
- Come on. Hey.

00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:16,843
- Let me go.
- It's all right.

690
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,177
- It's gonna be okay.
- Mom, no!

691
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:21,180
I'm so sorry, honey.

692
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:24,058
- Stop. Let me go. Mom, help me.
- It'll be okay.

Hey, you have to be strong.
You're doing the right thing.

- Who are you?
- Franny, go back to bed.

Mrs. Spatafore, really,
he's gonna be fine.

- No!
- I'm sorry, honey.

...over the visiting
San Antonio Spurs.

703
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:52,670
A sterling effort for sure,
but you really can't...

I really am.

You did real good with that house.

714
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:38,341
And I should know,
I'm in construction.

715
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:41,094
Well, I'm glad to hear you approve.

I'm fucking losing right now.

Real shitty streak.

718
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:52,605
So your solution is to risk more
and make things even worse?

719

Well, you start chasing it.

720
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:58,486
And every time you get
your hands around it...

721
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:03,116
...you fall further backwards.
So this is about money?

Carm, I swear to you,
you're not gonna be like Ginny.

I've been real good about that, and
frankly, it's not gonna happen to us.

And I hate that you're going around
acting all the time like it will.

I worry, Tony, I do.

and get the paper. Who is out there?

- Come on...
- What is it?

What are the million
other possibilities?

Right? You eat and you play...

a giant piano hanging by a rope...

I've been thinking about this.

736

Now, I survived a fucking
gunshot wound.

- What are the odds on that?
- Terrible.

big-picture-wise, I'm up.
