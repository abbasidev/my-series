00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:18,450
You own the building at 217 Franklin,

Jamba Juice...

142
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:29,461
wants to put a store
in around here?

143
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,130
Well, you must have
noticed the area's on an upswing.

144
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,341
You know the old glove factory
across the park,

145
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,676

146
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,678
I just bought
a loft there myself.

147
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:42,182
Person like yourself's a wonderful
addition to the neighborhood.

148
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:48,980
Jamba Juice is willing
to pay $175 a square foot.

149
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:52,150
Public records show
the building at 1,800 square feet.

150
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,612
So that makes
a purchase price of $315,000.

151
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,906
You ever buy eggs from Caputo?

152
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,950
Frankly, I'm not wild
about the smell in there.

153
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:03,328
Let me tell ya, his eggs
taste 10 times better

154
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,873
than any of the ones you get
in the supermarket. Chickens too.

155
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,209
Businesses relocate
all the time.

156
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:12,545
No, this would be a real loss
for the neighborhood.

157
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:14,631
Don't you live out
in North Caldwell?

158
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,175
Yeah, my family made
the trek up Guinea Gulch.

159
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:20,178
Bloomfield Avenue.

160
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,722
But my roots here go way back.

161
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,849
My grandfather
came from Avellino

162
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,727
like most of the people around here,
and I grew up right over there.

163
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:30,188
My father was an early
community leader.

164
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,941
Mm-hmm.

165
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,736
How about you?
Where're you from?

166
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,405
Upstate New York.

167
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,366
- Binghamton.
- How'd you wind up here?

168
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,869
My parents have
a catering business,

169
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,872
something to leave
to the kids, right?

170
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:51,292
Only I didn't see myself making
Salisbury steak for the next 30 years.

171
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,294
So I left home at 17.

172
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:56,840
- Rebellious.
- Just a low tolerance for boredom.

173
00:11:57,633 --> 00:12:01,261
So... interested,
not interested?

174
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:04,222
I'm interested.

175

put out an APB on the guy

349
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,160
'cause he takes it
up the ass, huh?

350
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:30,329
It's a victimless crime.

351
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:32,957
Marie is a victim.
Her children are victims.

352
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,084
They've done nothing.

353
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:37,086
And they're forced
to live with the shame

354
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:40,673
and humiliation.
I gotta be frank,

355
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,466
in your father's day,

356
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:45,094
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

357
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:48,347
A finook in his crew,
he knew how to handle that.

358
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,809
I sympathize with Marie

359
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,811
and the children, okay?

360
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:57,481
But don't you fucking tell me what
to do. You're only acting boss.

361
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:00,985
I swallowed my pride
when your murdering fuck of a cousin

362
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,987
killed my brother.

363
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,739
Don't think I'm
gonna do it twice.

364
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:09,327
Phillip, let's not make a beef
where there isn't one.

365
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:12,038
Fundamentally,
we are in agreement

366
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:15,291
on this issue,
but I'll handle it.

367
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:23,549
You know, I saw you on TV
when your grandfather shot your dad.

368
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,468
And now we're like friends.

369
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:28,512
- That's so weird.
- Right.

370
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,140
So what's gonna happen
to him, your grandfather, I mean?

371
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:33,976
He's my great-uncle.

372
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:35,811
So isn't your dad
gonna do something?

373
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:37,688
You know, the "omerto"?

374
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:41,275
We don't talk about that
with outsiders.

375
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,444
Cool, but I mean,

376
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:46,072
he's not just gonna
let him get away with it, is he?

377
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,825
I'll probably
have to do something.

378
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:51,786
Really?

379
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,081
You're so intense.

380
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,001
You probably left it
in the car, Thad.

381
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:01,003
No, it was on the bedside table.

382
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,923
- I was charging it.
- You're always losing something.

383
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,925
Last week it was the sunglasses.

384
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:08,719
He left them on the counter
at the TCBY.

385
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,222
- What did you lose?
- Cell phone.

386
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,891
I didn't lose it.
I was charging the damn thing.

387
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:16,519

- Some guy.

392
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:33,035
- Oh, my God, Vito.
- Not that.

393
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:36,789
I'm just borrowing his phone.

394
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:39,959
Listen, Marie,

395
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:42,753
I'm sorry all this
had to happen.

396
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,214
I never meant to hurt you.

397
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,758
Come back, Vito.
Just come back.

It's a little more
complicated than that.

400

Please, Phil said
it'll be all right.

401
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,934
We could get you help.
We could get you psychiatric help.

402

Phil? I trust him
least of all.

403
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:03,149
How can you say that?
He's family.

404
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:06,277
- He loves you.
- Not anymore, believe me.

405
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,279
But I've been reading online,

406
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,322
there are these church groups.

407
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,991
They could cure you of this.

408
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,659
- Marie...
- Well, what are you gonna do,

409
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,244
never come home?

410
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:16,704
I'm working on that.

411
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:21,584
In the meantime,
you're gonna need some cash.

412
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:23,961
I need you, Vito.
I need my husband.

the elliptical trainer,

414
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,469
the baseboard comes off.

415
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:34,388

You know, Marie,

417
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,646
- you would like it here.
- Tell me where.

418
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:44,940
I'll bring the kids.
We'll relocate.

419
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:46,817

420
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,111
Don't you wanna talk
to Frannie or little V?

421
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,199
Yeah, okay.

422
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:54,909
Put 'em on.

on the phone.

You won't get hammered
on the taxes.

Well, that's an incentive,

450
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:25,082
but the truth is
I don't wanna sell.

are you not?

As a businessman,
I gotta tell you

453
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,547
that in 10 years' time
that property's gonna

454
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:34,341
be worth twice as much
as they're offering.

just the money.

end at any time,

and if you've got
the chance to do something

474
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:35,736
that might make you happy,

I might have jumped.

- We were lucky the roof held.
- Did anyone hear that Yma Sumac scream

when the ceiling fan
came down? That was Ron.

Never happened.

are changing,

- there's nothing else like it.
- Yeah.

to write your book
in our little town.

What are you, some kind of fag?

- Guess I made a mistake.
- You sure as fuck did.

No, I mean nice clothes,
not socks and underwear.

He's my friend.

540

your friends that way.

541

Hernan's mother and I

00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,102
I could have a great club,

about my future,

into event planning,

Institute in Poughkeepsie.
