- Ho, the sanitation prince.

00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,967
Hi, Tony. I'm sorry
you're not feeling well.

180
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,512
Thank you.
Sorry about your loss.

181

- Hi.
- Hey.

184
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,774
Remember when you were a kid,

185
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:36,778
at that field box
at Shea, opening day?

186
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,447
Me, you, your dad
and Paulie here?

187
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:42,200
Oh yeah. Kingman was
just back from the Cubs.

Finn's picking me up.

191
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,960
- I'll be back later.
- Sweetheart,

192
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,962
thank you for everything.

193
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:57,298
Okay. Don't wear him out.

So, you're living
in Deer Valley?

197
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,396
Yeah, ski instructor.

198
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:14,899
So, Paulie tells me
you're thinking of selling

199
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,569
your father's business
to Chuckie Cinelli.

200
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:20,405
Yeah, I think it's
the best thing for Mom.

201
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:23,241
And of course, Tony, there'd be
a severance package for you.

202
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,827
Frankly, Jason, I don't think

203
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,829
you should sell
the business right now.

204
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,499
There's a lot
of potential buyers out there.

When I get out of the hospital,
run the numbers,

206
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:35,837
get you the best price.

207
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,589
No, Cinelli's offer seemed fair.

208
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,507
There's lots of things
to take into account.

209
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:42,010
- You even know what your EBITDA is?
- My what?

Earnings Before Interest, Taxes,
Depreciation and Amortization.

211
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:49,851
Gives the true picture
of a company's profitability.

212
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,064
Jas, you let me handle this.

213
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:58,151

to see you get hurt.

00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:03,406

We'll leave. Come on.

didn't call Ma.

some pignolis and...

a new pair of those
Speedo skin-diver socks you like.

Look at those.
The treads are all gone.

- Just a sec.

give me a hand here.

- Speak up, Aunt Dot.
- I was...

- How could you be a bad girl?

- You're a nun.
- These are too small.

237
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,785
No they ain't. They're supposed
to be snug so she don't slip.

- Put 'em on.
- Paulie...

During the war,
I was still a novitiate.

241
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:41,546
and there was
this soldier... Russ.

242

Aunt Dottie,
if this is going where I think,

244
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:48,887
maybe you should
talk to a priest.

245
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,930
I got pregnant.

246
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,309
- I had a baby.
- A baby?

Listen to her.

your physicians,

267

to see how fast we can
get you out of this place and back home.

They've closed your incision

now and I see they got the Foley out.

for Christ's sake.

would be working better

the sausage sandwich on 3/28.

I've been contributing

Look, you think we're the enemy,
but if you hadn't had insurance,

279

you would have ended up
at the County Hospital.

card with you

- In the ambulance.

your card with you,

with the street cred,

been something of a problem

00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:32,285
I don't wanna know
when it's coming. You decide.

691
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,707
Get this...

692
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,626
It says here that if the history
of the planet

693
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:42,670
was represented
by the Empire State Building,

694
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,173
the time that human beings
have been on earth

695
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:49,177
would only be a postage stamp
at the very top.

696
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:52,680
You realize how insignificant
that makes us?

697
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,891
I don't feel that way.

698
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,186
- Hey.
- Hey.

699
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,687
There he is.

700
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:03,024
- Hi, Chris.
- Hesh, how are you?

701
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,151
Great to see you
looking so robust.

702
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:08,029
- Hey.
- How you doing?

703
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,823
- Beth wanted to come.
- Yeah, sure.

704
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:12,784
- Hi, Tony.
- Hey.

705
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:14,494
So how's Eli?

706
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:17,831
I hear that with the physical therapy,
they got him using a walker.

707
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:20,083
He's doing better.
Thank you.

708
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:23,253
(KNOCKING)
Hey, Tony.

709
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:24,838
Okay to visit?

710
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:26,714
Yeah, yeah, sure.

711
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:31,636
My nephew Christopher,
Pastor Bob.

712
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,930
Hesh Rabkin, his daughter Beth.

713
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:37,308
- Hi.
- How you feeling?

714
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:39,352
Physically,
a little better than I was.

715
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,938
So maybe you're right.
That prayer business works.

716
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:46,192
I brought you something.

717
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:48,361
- "Born Again."
- Charles Colson.

718
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:50,113
The Watergate guy.

719
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:51,614
Friend of mine
did time with him.

720
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:55,326
A ruthless, powerful man
who thought he was above the law.

721
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:58,037
He committed crimes
and then went to prison.

722
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:01,082
And then he found Jesus,
and everything changed.

723
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:04,419
Became a different man.

724
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:07,422
Yeah, so?

725
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:11,759
Salvation isn't just about

726
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,220
being saved from hell
after you die.

727
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:17,849
It's also about being saved from
yourself while you're still alive.

728
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:22,645
I hope when you get
out of the hospital

729
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:25,899
that you'll join us at the Church
of the Open Door of the Redeemer.

730
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,778
Well it must be nice

731
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,947
to have something to hold onto.

732
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:37,160
Maybe.

733
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,793
- Hmm.
- What?

734
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:49,923
Dinosaurs.
My kids can't get enough.

735
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,592
Yeah, yeah, me too.

736
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:56,095
Every since I saw King Kong
kick their ass in the original.

737
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:58,264
My son loves dinosaurs too.

738
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:00,266
- That's interesting.
- What?

739
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:02,310
Some people would
have you believe

740
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,604
dinosaurs existed
millions of years ago.

741
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:07,315
It's just not true.

742
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:10,485
God created the earth
6,000 years ago.

743
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:12,445
And I tell my kids,
you have to remember,

744
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:16,199
dinosaurs and human beings
lived on the earth at the same time.

745
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:20,286
What, like "The Flintstones"?

746
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:22,288
It's in the Bible.

747
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:24,958
Yeah, but what about all that
carbon-dating stuff?

748
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:27,460
A lot of scientists
would disagree with you.

749
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,964
Well, I think you'll find
all those people have an agenda, Tony...

750
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:35,218
evolution, which is
Satan's plan to deny God.

751
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:39,347
Evolution and salvation
are mutually exclusive.

752
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:43,017
Guy next door's a scientist.
Think he'd disagree with you big time.

753
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,811
Then that man's not saved.

754
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:50,858
Read about Mr. Colson.
We'll talk later.

755
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:59,492
What's he saying? There were dinosaurs
back with Adam and Eve?

756
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,952
- I guess.
- No way.

757
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:02,829
T. Rex in the garden
of Eden?

758
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:04,664
Adam and Eve
would be running all the time,

759
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:08,668
scared shitless.
But the Bible says it was paradise.

760
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,545
You can disagree
with Evangelicals,

761
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:11,879
but they're great friends
of the Jews

762
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:15,592
because Israel is the Holy Land.

763
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:17,677
You wait.

764
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,939
Hey, how ya doing?

765
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:32,650
- Hi.
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

766
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:38,781
Your color's better.

767
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:43,202
So Mr. Wizard, you were talking
about tornados.

768
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:48,249
You know what
the Indians say about the wind?

769
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,376
- No.
- They say that sometimes

770
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:53,004
we go around feeling pity
for ourselves,

771
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:56,257
but behind our back,
a great wind is carrying us.

772
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:58,885
We don't see we're part
of a much bigger reality.

773
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:01,763
- Then we die.
- Why are you so interested in all this?

774
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:10,188
I was in this coma and, uh...

775
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:13,066
look, I don't remember nothing,

776
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:15,526
but before I woke up,

777
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:19,072
I felt like I was being pulled
towards something.

778
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:24,243
And I don't wanna go back.

779
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:27,580
And my wife told me
I woke up at one point and said...

780
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:32,502
"Who am I?

781
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:35,213
Where am I going?"

782
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:38,424
Kinda makes you wonder,

783
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:41,761
about heaven and hell.

784
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:44,972
That presupposes a duality
of good and evil.

785
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,974
You know it gets us
back to the idea

786
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:51,229
of separate, opposing entities.

787
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:52,855
You know where I go with that.

788
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:55,274
But this Bible guy
I know says you're going to hell.

789
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:57,110
Maybe he's right.

790
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:59,987
Got my test results back.

791
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:03,449

792
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:06,119
Jesus, I'm sorry.

793
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:08,079
You know I was thinking,
maybe you could do me a favor

794
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:10,540
and, uh, you know
what's the term,

795
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:13,626
"whack" me?

796
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:16,754
Sorry, bad joke.

797
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:33,896
- Walking alone again.
- What, I'm gonna wait for Vito?

798
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:36,649

to take a dump, that guy.

with what comes out.

throw her out on the street?

She fed you.

809
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:12,018

of the can when you were a kid?

00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:14,520
