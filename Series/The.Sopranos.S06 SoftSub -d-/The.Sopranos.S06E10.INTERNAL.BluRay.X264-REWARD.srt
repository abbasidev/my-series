Fuck you. The guy was gonna
get cooked.

to be, a big man?

- Back the fuck off!
- What the fuck, Jim?

358

Boys, boys, calm down.

359
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,884
Okay, now let's cut the bullshit,
get the water turned off

360
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,928
and pump out the damn basement.

I gotta say, I thought you guys
were morons for doing this shit,

363
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:38,105
but now I can see
it's a fuckin' rush.

364
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:39,732
You should join the department.
That would be good.

365
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,233
We could use another moron.

You have to have
a passion, really.

I've got these bad hips.
Supposed to have surgery.

forget this craphole

Well, according to John,
the retail value of Bayou Leasing

401
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:17,163
is around six mil.
Seem about right?

402
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,582
- Between five and six.
- Let's do this again, chere.

403
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:25,212
Well, you're gonna have to find a buyer
and deliver John's half to me

404
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,883
and in about 30 days, give you a chance
to get a couple of bidders.

- His half?
- Yeah.

that's up for debate.

I've been saying all along.

don't seem like brothers.

out fighting. I thank you.

with the breaking news.

don't go there no more.

of sidewalk into the eye there.

438
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:25,666
- But they're optimistic.
- Right, doctors.

439
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,836
It's always good news
till it ain't.

00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:31,505

happened to you

441
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:33,507

It was early.
Maybe I caught a break.

00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:48,397
Still encapsulated.

447
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:50,399
I'm taking a course of radiation

into the single digits.

00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:57,239
Well, are you all right?
The hair and shit?

450
00:26:57,741 --> 00:27:00,868
Heh, knock wood, eh?

451
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,953
I must have done
good things in my life.

452
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,872
Yeah.

453
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,168
All right.

454
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:10,669
The cancer...

455
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,713
your ears only.

456
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,381
Absolutely.

00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:19,803
You hear about Bobby?

459
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,472
- Yeah.
- Should've seen him.

460
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,724
Put a patch over his eye
like Hathaway.

461
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,809
He was really rattled.

462
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:29,188
Still, let's face it, it was kind
of stupid to be out there that late.

463
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,774
Ton', cops don't even
go there no more.

464
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:34,860
Anyway, Bobby's vision's
fucked now.

465
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,654
They're hoping
the repair will take.

466
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,947
He could be a candidate
for a cornea transplant.

467
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:41,575
He should be a candidate
for a brain transplant.

- (CHUCKLES)
- To his credit,

469

all he was thinking about
was straightening out for the week.

and loyalty" shit.

471
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,752
It was a maneuver, Carlo,

472
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,254
'cause he knew it was
his own fucking fault.

473
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,057
What?

474
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,850
Don't give me that look.

475
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:13,941
Including the wife's IRA

476
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:17,569
and his pension,

477
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:20,989
we'd go for 240 months.

478
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:25,327
20 years and 90% of his assets?

479
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,454
Makes trial seem like
a risk worth taking.

480
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:29,415
Have you seen
the discovery evidence?

481
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:31,125
You came to us.

482
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:34,128
My client insisted
the house is off-limits.

483
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:36,714
He wants his wife provided for.

484
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,257
So what do you have in mind?

485
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:42,511
Renee, again, the shit
that has nothing to do with him:

486
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:45,848
the house, her IRA, the Yukon,

487
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:48,934
the deed
on the daughter's condo.

488
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:52,146
- And 12 years.
- For a conspiracy to commit murder?

489
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:54,857
Get back to me
when you're sober, Ron.

no good here.

Not sure even seven will,
but the Eagles will go for it.

Oh, no, no.
I'm good.

getting her folks in the car.

497

Where's Barb and Tom?

498
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:17,838
I asked them to bring wine.

499
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,424
We'll see how long that takes.

500
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,551
Did you take the Vicodin?

501
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,389
Once again, they'll have
the ball.

502
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:29,558
They'll take over
from their own 25 yard line.

503
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:32,770
Manning has had success throwing
the ball, Tiki Barber running the ball...

00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,521
Giants, huh?

505
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,690
Fucking blowing 'em out.

506
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,692
As long as they
don't beat the spread.

507
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:43,197
- Where are you going?
- Out.

508
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:45,365
The Giants are kicking ass here.

509
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:47,785
I'm going to Eric's
to watch the Chargers.

510
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,995
- What channel's that on?
- Some people aren't too cheap

511
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,538
to buy the satellite package.

512
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:53,874
Sit down.
This is a Giants house.

513
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:57,586
- I hate the fucking Giants.
- Ho! What'd we say about that language?

514
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:59,630
AJ didn't have
to come to Sunday dinner.

515
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:03,175
AJ has a job.
Do you wanna go get a job?

516
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:05,177
Go ahead.

517
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,929
But first go get
your last report card

518
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:09,223
and read it out loud
to everybody.

519
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,934
Oh... went right out
of Shockey's hands...

520
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:18,065
No? I thought so.

521
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,818
Now go finish
your Spanish report before dinner.

522
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,571
Set the table, honey.

523
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:30,077
