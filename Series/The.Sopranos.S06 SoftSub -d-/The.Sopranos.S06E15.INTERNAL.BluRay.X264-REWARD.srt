Stop causing a commotion.

00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:45,788
What'd you do that for?

699
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:47,624
I should piss myself again?

700
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:49,000
But I did the thing.

You didn't come to lunch.

717
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:51,914
I brought you these...

718
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:55,251
...from Keith. He owed me money.

Thanks.

721
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:06,262
That was a nice letter
you wrote to Cheney.

722
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:10,641
But he don't read them himself.
They got computers that do it.

723
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:13,269
I asked Lynch, the professor.

724
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,646
What are you talking to him for?

You're very smart, Anthony.

731
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:45,384
I'm sure you're very good
with spelling too.

Rigatoni à la Paulie.

733
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:37,645
But since you're eating it,
maybe it should be rigatoni à la Tony.

What, you're not hungry?

You know, when you went down below,
I thought I saw a whale.

...no matter what John said.

741
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:21,188
- Gotta have a sense of humor, right?
- Yeah.

742
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:29,989

748

He was a funny prick, that Ralph.

749

His Gladiator fixation...

750
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:56,599
...the time he hit Georgie in the eye
with the chain.

751
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:02,521
I'd have loved to have seen John's face
when he heard that crack.

No offense, but you ever
had yourself checked for Tourette's?

- What?
- Tourette syndrome.

you told John about that joke, right?

- It wasn't me, Ton.
- No?
