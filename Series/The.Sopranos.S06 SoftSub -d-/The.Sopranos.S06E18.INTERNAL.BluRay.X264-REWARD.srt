00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,068
Crazy fucking maniac.

177
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:28,366
The thing to take to heart, T,
you're here. You're all right.

178
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,535
You could have been killed,
for fuck's sake.

179
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,329
What are you gonna do?

180
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,750
Thanks.

181
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:42,505
- What are you doing?
- No, no, no, I gotta try and get up.

182
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:45,925
I gotta go and meet Carm
over at Chrissy's...

183
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:48,761
...with Kelli and all that.

184
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:51,764
I'll make you a plate.

185
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:54,434
- Get me a Scotch.
- Are you serious?

186
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:57,103
Yeah, and have one yourself.

187
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,235
They were close, the two cousins.

188
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,950
You all right?

189
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,204
I know I had my differences
with that kid...

190
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:18,625
...but maybe I didn't
do right by him, neither.

191
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:21,085
If you were his dad,
I was his Dutch uncle...

192
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:24,547
...and what the fuck
did I do but get pissed off...

193
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:28,509
...fight with him over
cock-sucking fucking money?

194
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:31,596
I'd break his balls when he tried
not to have a drink...

195
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,473
...or a little taste of snow.

196
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,851
It's over, Paulie.

197
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,563
(ANNOUNCER SPEAKING)

198
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:42,023
Gets it up. And that was blocked.
Gets it back.

199
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,067
Did anybody
ever hear from the hospital?

200
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:46,861
I was waiting till Kelli woke up.

201
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,782
They found cocaine in his blood.

202
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,910
Cause of death was a hemothorax.

203
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:57,080
Yeah, airbags can crush the ribs
when there's no other restraint.

204
00:15:57,414 --> 00:16:01,000
They said he might have made it,
but he didn't.

205
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,252
Couldn't have worn
his goddamn seat belt?

206
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,672
- No wonder. He was wackadoo.
- AI, stop it.

207
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,758
Baloney. He leaves
our granddaughter fatherless.

208
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:14,681
- My only child!
- Drinking won't help, honey.

209
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,683
- (MUTTERS)
- Jesus Christ.

210
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,189
Look at this. Syracuse is losing.

211
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,196
I don't know what to say.

212
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,657
- What?
- I just got a call from Little Paulie.

213
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,493
Nucci Gualtieri died.

214
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:40,206
Stroke on the bus back to the home.

215
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,542
They had gone to see Jersey Boys.

216
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,047
This is difficult.

217
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:51,134
This is pain...

218
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,719
...like I'm not used to.

219
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:56,222
We've said before
he was like a son in some ways.

220
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,766
To see him die like that...

221
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,144
...practically in my arms.

222
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,856
He was just starting his life.

223
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,733
Yeah.

224
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:17,577
You know what?

225
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,706
- This is bullshit.
- What?

226
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,917
I haven't been able
to tell anybody this, but...

227
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,379
...I'm fucking relieved.

228
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,256
Really?

229
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:34,177
He was a tremendous drag
on my emotions, on my...

230
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:35,887
...thoughts about the future.

231
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,223
Every morning I wake up thinking:

232
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,601
"Is today the day
one of my best friends...

233
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,686
...is gonna dime me to the FBI?"

234
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:46,022
And a weak, fucking sniveling...

235
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,734
...lying drug addict?
That's the worst kind of bet.

236
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:53,780
The biggest blunder of my career
is now gone.

237
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:57,408
And I don't have to be confronted
by that fact no more.

238
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,953
And as a relative, a friend...

239
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:03,706
...someone you can count on...

240
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,085
I see.

241
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,050
Let me tell you something.

242
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:17,303
I've murdered friends before,
even relatives...

243
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,806
My cousin Tony...

244
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,266
...my best friend, Puss.

245
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,061
But this?

246
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,563
(SNORTS)

247
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,862
Was I talking in my sleep?

248
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,823
Snoring.

249
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,242
I'm gonna put on the TV
if you don't mind.

250
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,994
I can't stay asleep either. I'm all...

251
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:47,542
(TV TURNS ON)

252
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,795
I mean, I can laugh and cry,
and I could always get the part.

253
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,673
- First time?
- First time. Never could keep it.

254
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,925
They got onto me after a while.

255
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,678
I'd lose my voice,
fall down, get red in the face...

256
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,305
...talk too fast and couldn't act.

257
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,172
Can you make me a cappuccino?

258
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:37,925
That fucking machine from Paulie,
you need a pilot's license.

259
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:44,140
It's so hard not to think
of Christopher as a child, isn't it?

260
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:47,393
Caity kind of looks like him,
which makes it doubly hard.

261
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,606
Of course that's not gonna
do her any favors...

262
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:53,983
...when she hits puberty,
that schnoz.

263
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,527
A lot of women
found him very attractive.

264
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,741
I think to myself:

265
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:05,578
How could I have ever said
those things about him...

266
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:09,373
...about him and Adriana,
what her mother said he did to her?

267
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:21,844
Obviously he was violent as an adult,
his upbringing, but he adored Ade.

268
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:24,096
He could never let himself take her life.

269
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:30,102
Why are we so quick to blame?
What is the attraction in that?

270
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:47,078
It's good. Thank you.

271
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,625
When I called you...

272
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:56,420
...the night after the accident,
and you asked me:

273
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:59,090
"Oh my God, Tony, he's dead?"

274
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,550
Yeah.

275
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:03,594
And I thought...

276
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:07,348
Well, I thought
I picked up a twinge of...

277
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,352
...relief.
What?

278
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,396
It just seemed like... I don't know...

279
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:16,315
How could you say that?
You don't know what you're saying.

280
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:17,483
Okay, good, I'm wrong.

281
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:21,988
If you did pick up something like that,
maybe it's because I was relieved...

282
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:23,906
...that it was him and not you.

283
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:26,659
Well, don't feel bad about that.
That makes sense.

284
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:34,875
To be going down to the hospital again
at 2 in the morning?

285
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,008
And you know what?
When you were shot...

286
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:44,302
...it was Christopher who held me.

287
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:52,018
You know the baby's car seat?

288
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:56,564
A giant tree branch
came through the window...

289
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,733
...and demolished it.

290
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,362
She would have been dead, Caitlin...

291
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,865
...mangled beyond recognition.

292
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:22,798
I told her about the baby seat
so she wouldn't feel so rotten.

293
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:25,468
He was high as a fucking kite.
I didn't tell her that.

294
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:29,013
In retrospect,
maybe not the best approach.

295
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:32,725
Right, I'm the asshole again.

296
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,103
(SIGHS)

297
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:37,563
What?

298
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:40,441
No, go ahead.

299
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:45,196
It's amazing how things work.

300
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:48,991
His mother, my cousin Joanne...

301
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,701
...a lush.

302
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,579
Totally abandoned him as a parent...

303
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:58,417
...but now she's reaping
all the sympathy and the tears.

304
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:01,045
How are you doing, Anthony?

305
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:05,549
There have been
some hard moments.

306
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,262
But a weak, lying drug addict...

307
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,223
...who fantasized
about my downfall...

308
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,433
...who showed people
his filthy thoughts...

309
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:16,519
...on a movie screen?

310
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:21,774
Let me tell you something.
I've seen friends die before...

311
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:24,235
...accidents...

312
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,362
...even murder.

313
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,531
My cousin Tony,
they shot his face away.

314
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:32,034
And I was fucking prostate with grief.

315
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,452
But this?

316
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:36,747
I see.

317
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,041
And it occurs to me,
I hand-carried this kid...

318
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,544
...through the worst crisis
he ever had.

319
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:47,091
I can't go into particulars, but...

320
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,301
...wives, girlfriends...

321
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:51,554
...they can complicate life
in a major way.

322
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:53,389
I don't have to tell you that.

323
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,603
Anyway, huge problem
of his own making.

324
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:05,234
And he cried.
He couldn't deal with it.

325
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:09,572
So I took up the slack. I handled it.

326
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,824
I felt sorry for him.

327
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:14,660
Now he talked gratitude...

328
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:20,249
...but guess what pity produces in
the recipient. They shit on your pity.

329
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:24,962
And that's what broke
the camel's back.

330
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:28,674
How are you handling all this?

331
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:31,177
The worst part, truthfully...

332
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:36,098
...is I gotta sit there
with people who are hurting.

333
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,850
Bad.

334
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,353
And I gotta have the long face...

335
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:45,274
...and the sighing and the platitudes.

336
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:47,860
But I don't feel it.

337
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,532
Then that makes me feel
like a hypocrite.

338
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:57,369
And that makes me mad at them.

339
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,686
Oh, hi.

340
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,647
How are you?

341
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:34,657
Julianna Skiffle,
this is my wife, Carmela Soprano.

342
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:38,536
- Skiff.
- Oh, yeah, right.

343
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:42,081
Julianna's a real estate agent
in the old neighborhood.

344
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,083
And you knew Christopher?

345
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:46,919
I used to buy my meat at Satriale's.

346
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:53,425
I'm a recovering addict.

347
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:56,762
- I owe him a lot.
- That's nice to hear.

348
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:02,434
- Well, what are you gonna do, huh?
