How about an early-bird special?

I'll give it back to the bank

Well, there is credit card fraud
going on in this restaurant.

369

- That's impossible.
- Based on cardholder disputes,

370
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:46,304
we show nine hits in this locus
that precede fraudulent activity.

371
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,514
- What does that mean?
- People's card numbers were copied

372
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:51,475
and those numbers were used to rack up
thousands of dollars in phony charges.

853
00:48:58,018 --> 00:48:59,644
How'd it go with the movie star?

854
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:02,772
He was all over us,
but I don't think he's right.

855
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:05,775
We made some great contacts.
Plus we saw Lindsay Lohan.

856
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:07,526
Total piece of ass.

857
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:11,948
You hear Artie burned his hand?

858
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:16,118
Yeah. Him and Benny.
How crazy is that?

859
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:18,120
- He okay?
- A layer of skin

860
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:19,997
came off his hand like a glove.

861
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:23,292
But, they said, you know,
no scarring, no grafts.

862
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:26,087
- Lucky.
- Hmm.

863
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:29,674
Well, not for nothin'.
I couldn't help but thinkin'

864
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:33,302
if you were here
watching your crew,

865
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,304
things wouldn't have gone
the way they did.

866
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:37,348
You let me go, T.

867
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:39,934
I asked you. Now it's my fault Artie
and Benny got into it?

868
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:43,854
This is what I was concerned about,
Christopher, the loss of focus.

869
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:46,440
Look...

870
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:50,528
not many guys have had to make
the kind of sacrifice I did.

871
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:53,155
How many times you gonna play
the Adriana card?

872
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:05,334
Sandy just seated a couple.

873
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:07,086
Kitchen's closed.

874
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:10,339
He said they were supposed to go
to the city but they had car trouble.

875
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:14,010
Hector already left
to pick up his wife.

876
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:16,512
Plus I got nothing
back here, Charm.

877
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,681
They already opened the bottle.

878
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:31,318
They're gonna have to eat
what I give them.

879
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:27,083
Arthur, a lot of people
don't like rabbit.

880
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,626
My grandfather's way.

881
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:30,377
Only with Provenal elements
I been thinking about.

882
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:32,922
I thought you were taking
it to him at the home.

883
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:36,801
Okay... out.
I wanna get outta here tonight.

884
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:42,765
(SIZZLING)

885
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:46,560
(BREATHES)

886
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:51,774
(ITALIAN FOLK MUSIC
PLAYING)

887
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:10,334
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)
For my mom.

888
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:13,712
A store on the 57th street?

889
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:16,423
If you bought this in Naples?

890
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:19,635
The weak dollar.

891
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:27,643
Mont Blanc. Actually
cheaper in the U.S
