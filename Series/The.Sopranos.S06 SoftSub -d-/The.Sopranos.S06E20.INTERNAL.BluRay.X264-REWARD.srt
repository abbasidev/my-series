00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:11,641
...suggested that sociopaths,
actually quite glibly...

176
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:15,228
...engage on key issues,
like mother, family.

177
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,146
I seem to remember that
from residency.

178
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:18,940
Me too, and I've read Hare...

179
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,818
...but who's a true sociopath?

180
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,988
I had a guy at the state asylum...

181
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:28,074
...slow poisoner.
They even mimic empathy.

182
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,827
They blubber and cry.

183
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,914
Did you put her up to this?
She just happened to mention this study?

184
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:36,249
Who? Me?

185
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,668
Everything okay down there?

186
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:43,089
- I don't know.
- It's a study. Food for thought.

187
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,757
She's blowing us off.

188
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:48,011
You just can't resist
rubbing my face in it.

189
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:50,680
I feel like we should change the subject.

190
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,057
I only suggested you
reevaluate your work...

191
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:56,060
...with Leadbelly
or be prepared to deal with moral...

192
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,438
...and possibly legal consequences.

193
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:01,316
- Leadbelly?
- Who's that? Come on.

194
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:04,444
The answer is a female opera singer...

195
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:07,405
...and gangster.

196
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,116
Elliot!

197
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,452
Soprano.

198
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:16,456
Tony Soprano? He's your patient?

199
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,208
- That's pretty cool.
- Jesus Christ, Elliot.

200
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:22,754
Chill out. We're among friends.
We're all professionals.

201
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,302
So, what's your verdict on the wine, Jen?

202
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,429
All Italians have big noses.

203
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:35,141
If I had made that joke
about other groups...

204
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,477
...represented at this table...

205
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:39,562
...I would be called a bigot.

206
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,231
I meant Italian reds.

207
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:47,445
Still, it must be fascinating work.

208
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,990
It is.

209
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,014
Have a seat.

210
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,602
- What's up?
- Phil Leotardo.

211
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:23,356
Calls were made to zips.
They're coming over from Naples.

212
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:25,483
You contact the guy to contact the guys.

213
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:28,861
Phil's at his goomar's every Friday night.

214
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,030
- T know about this?
- What?

215
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:33,866
- What kind of question is that?
- Watch your fucking mouth.

216
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,412
What are you concerned about?

217
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,872
I lived through the '70s
by the skin of my nuts...

218
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,708
...when the Colombos were going at it.

219
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,752
There ain't a bigger cocksucker
than Phil Leotardo.

220
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,879
I just wanna make sure
somebody knows...

221
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:49,841
...there could be a line
at Cozzarelli's a mile long.

222
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,177
Duly noted. So there's no problem, then.

223
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,353
(CONVERSING QUIETLY)

224
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,272
He'll be quiet.

225
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,818
- Don't worry about them.
- Paulie, those guys are outside.

226
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:53,446
Fuck you talking so loud for?

227
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:56,699
Don't discuss this
until we're in the pisciatoio.

228
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,954
It's all yours.

229
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,549
I just picked them up at the airport.

230
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:04,517
Anthony.

231
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,782
So, what do you clear a year around here?

232
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,995
I don't mean to pry, you know,
just round numbers.

233
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:33,171
I'm asking because Meadow...

234
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,506
Well, I told you she's taking
pre-med classes.

235
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:39,677
Well, she's not gonna be a doctor.

236
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,388
She told us.

237
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,142
It's kind of sad, isn't it?

238
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,605
- Depends.
- You know, it's just a nice thing to be...

239
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,440
...helping sick babies.

240
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:54,692
Her change of heart bothers you?

241
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,820
Her mother too, much more than me.

242
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,530
I mean, all that worrying...

243
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:03,242
...which private school,
Columbia University...

244
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,578
...this and that. And in the end...

245
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:08,456
...she'll get married,
squeeze out some kids...

246
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,416
...after a couple years
in the work force?

247
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:13,669
- I'm still working.
- Yeah, but you're divorced.

248
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:19,008
Criminal law,
that's what she's taking up.

249
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:21,928
And I told Carmela,
"It's not the end of the world."

250
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,804
(SIGHS)

251
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:28,809
She's interested in civil rights.

252
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:32,772
Muslims and blacks...

253
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:34,357
...and that and a dime.

254
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,653
Hopefully, she'll wind up
at a big firm...

255
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,948
...white-collar crime.

256
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,577
It's just, you know...

257
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,956
Dr. Soprano.

258
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,251
Sounds nice.

259
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,799
Your parents must
have been very proud.

260
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:01,300
I think so.

261
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:03,803
I mean, look at all the people
like me you've helped.

262
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,640
With all the human suffering
in this world...

263
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,268
...you've done
something important.

264
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,897
Like those people...

265
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:17,316
...who are trying to help my son.

266
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,654
God bless them.

267
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:28,035
Two thousand a day in that place,
but if it helps...

268
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:30,162
As you know,
my plumbers' union insurance...

269
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:33,124
...only covers 10 percent of mental.

270
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,921
He's really hurting...

271
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,673
...A.J.

272
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,883
And you?

273
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:44,885
Although, maybe, you know...

274
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:47,638
You know what? Forget his hurts.
Maybe I should have just...

275
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,849
Put your shoe up his ass?

276
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,185
Yeah. Yeah, frankly.

277
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:58,024
- Well, we talked about this.
- And talked about it.

278
00:21:58,191 --> 00:21:59,817
HUH?

279
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,654
- Anyway, Carmela...
- Mollycoddled him.

280
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,365
- My old man...
- Are you a shining example...

281
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:09,452
...for the huge collection
of wingtips and loafers...

282
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:12,371
...that must be lodged up
your lower bowel?

283
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,457
What's the matter with you?

284
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:17,710
Is it because I said
that about being divorced?

285
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,212
You were saying.

286
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,465
He's my only son.

287
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:26,093
He's young. Most of the time
they pull out of this.

288
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:28,929
But I've been depressed for years.
What if he don't pull out?

289
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:33,392
So the boy who never cared
about anything...

290
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,895
...now cares about too much.

291
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,480
Yeah, I guess.

292
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:40,858
And the daughter, like all females...

293
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:45,196
...ultimately somehow disappoints.
I didn't say that.

294
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,283
What's with the tone?

295
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:53,245
You sound like you're glad
I'm taking it on the chin.

296
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,998
Maybe you're projecting
hostile feelings.

297
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:59,585
Bullshit. If we had instant replay...

298
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,170
...you'd see it in two seconds.

299
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,255
Well, we don't have instant replay.

300
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:06,592
I know that. Jesus Christ,
you sound like my fucking wife.

301
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,428
- Your "fucking wife."
- You know what I mean.

302
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,348
The Departures magazine out there...

303
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,183
...did you give any thought at all...

304
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:17,019
...to someone else
who might wanna read it...

305
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:21,399
...before you tore out the entire page?
What?

306
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:25,111
It's not the first time
you've defaced my reading materials.

307
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:26,779
You saw that, huh?

308
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:29,949
People tear shit out
of your magazines all the time.

309
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,284
They're a mess. I try to read them.

310
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:34,537
I don't think I can help you.

311
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:36,455
Change them.
Bring in some new shit.

312
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,249
I mean, therapeutically.

313
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:43,129
What are you talking about?

314
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:47,758
I've only missed three appointments
since we had that heart-to-heart.

315
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,261
The new big thing these days is called...

316
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,555
..."psychodynamic therapy"...

317
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:54,723
...combined with Anafranil.

318
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,100
- Who?
- A medication.

319
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:59,103
There's a doctor in Bloomfield
you could see.

320
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,856
Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay.

321
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:05,401
Now what the fuck is this?
You're firing me...

322
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:08,112
...because I defaced
your Departures magazine?

323
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,615
I'm giving you my considered
medical opinion.

324
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,160
Okay, I should have asked you...

325
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:16,620
...for the steak recipe.

326
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,250
And missing sessions, unfortunately,
is part of my condition.

327
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:24,336
What do you know about your condition?

328
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:27,673
You miss appointments because
you don't give a shit...

329
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:30,342
...about commitments, about what I do...

330
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,512
...about the body of work
that's gone into...

331
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,182
...building up this science.

332
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:43,481
Go ahead, tell me again
I sound like your wife.

333
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:44,857
Well, if the shoe fits...

334
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:50,613
We're making progress.
It's been seven years.

335
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,698
Do you want some names?

336
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,869
I'm gonna tell you something.
You're not gonna like it...

337
00:24:57,037 --> 00:25:00,372
...but we can say anything in here, right?
Go ahead!

338
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,417
I'm chalking this all up...

339
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:06,879
...to female menopausal situations.

340
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,048
You're not my gynecologist.

341
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:12,927
Well, you don't need a gynecologist
to know which way the wind blows.

342
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:21,602
So wait a minute...

343
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:26,065
...you're telling me after all this time...

344
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:29,568
...after everything we shared in here...

345
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:32,988
...you're cutting me loose
just as my son got out of the hospital...

346
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:34,740
...for trying to kill himself?
