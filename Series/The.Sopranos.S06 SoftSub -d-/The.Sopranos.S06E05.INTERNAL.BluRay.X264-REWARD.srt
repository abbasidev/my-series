00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,857
Rusty!

00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,194
Rusty!

4
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,906
You don't answer,
someone calls you?

5
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:58,408
Look at this
shit now.

(BUZZER)

7
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,846
What do you got
for me, Counselor?

8
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:20,889
The Brioni.

9
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,115
Hear ye, hear ye.

10
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:41,952
The Honorable Dennis Holzer of the
Eastern District of New York presiding.

11
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,913
Court is now in session.
Be seated.

12
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:47,499
Come to order.

13
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:50,878
The defendant's request for temporary
release from federal custody

14
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:54,882
to attend his daughter's
wedding is ludicrous.

15
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,635
Mr. Sacrimoni is a known member
of organized crime

16
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:01,305
at the helm of a vast
criminal conspiracy.

17
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:03,724
I notice you're wearing
a wedding ring, Ms. Vaughn.

18
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,767
Was your father
at your wedding?

19
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,896
My father wasn't awaiting trial
on 47 RICO predicates,

20
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,898
including murder.

21
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:15,319
Mr. Sacrimoni...

22
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:18,280
your application is granted.
(SIGHS)

23
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:22,618
- Oh, thank God!
- On the following conditions. Quiet!

24
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:27,080
You'll be released
for a total of six hours

25
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,917
to attend the church service
and party thereafter.

26
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:33,128
During the entirety
of the six hours,

27
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,839
you will be escorted
by U.S. marshals.

28
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:40,010
The cost of their presence,
transportation

29
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:43,722
and the cost of metal-detection
screening equipment

30
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:47,100
is to be borne by you
at your own expense.

31
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:49,895
You will consume
no alcohol

32
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:54,316
nor other
intoxicating substances.

33
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:57,778
Do you understand
and agree to these conditions?

34
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:00,656
I do, Your Honor,
and thank you.

35
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,533
Mrs. Soprano, good morning.

36
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,453
- I'm Perry... Annunziata.
- Come in.

37
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:14,002
Beautiful house.

38
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,005
You are Gina Annunziata's
cousin, right?

39
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:20,509
Muscles Marinara,
the Italian strongman.

40
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,512
I'm just glad you got somebody
capable of protecting you,

41
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,932
- driving for you.
- Well, that's why I got him here.

42
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,600
She worries,
my wife.

43
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,812
- Yeah, well...
- He's in good hands, Mrs. Soprano.

44
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,898
First runner-up,
Mr. Teenage Bloomfield.

45
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,150
Your first day
back at work.

46
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:39,278
Gosh, I feel
like a mommy.

47
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,363
Hey. Come on.

48
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,365
See you later.

49
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:54,293
So what do you do?
Free weights, machines?

50
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,838
Little bit of both. Depends what muscles
I'm trying to hit, you know?

51
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,798
Oh.

52
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,386
Yeah, I gotta get
back to the gym.

53
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:07,222
You want, I'll make you
a program.

54
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:13,437
There was a time
when I could bench over 300 lbs.

55
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,940
With a major head cold
one time, I did it.

56
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,112
You cough with weights
like that over your head,

57
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,114
you crush your neck.

58
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,158
I guess I don't
gotta tell you.

59
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:37,878
Ho! You don't signal?

60
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:39,254
Hey, fuck you!

61
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,048
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

62
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:56,355
Sorry.

63
00:05:56,773 --> 00:06:00,734
My mom says I should count 10,
but I never remember.

64
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,914
Well, here I am.

65
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:17,209
- Back.
- Yep.

66
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:19,086
So let me ask you
right off,

67
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,004
is there any chance
of a mercy fuck?

68
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:24,716
Just kidding.

69
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:29,596
- How are you feeling?
- You went to medical school.

70
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:32,140
A gut shot is everything they ever
told you it was.

71
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,351
And emotionally?

72
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,229
I'm happy to be alive.

73
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:39,773
Have you spoken
to your uncle since it happened?

74
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:44,111
No. And won't.

75
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,657
Finally get to sleep
in my own bed tonight.

76
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:52,077
Had a hospital bed
in the house

77
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:55,038
- last month and a half or so.
- Is sleeping difficult?

78
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,583
- Tylenol helps.
- What about dreams,

79
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,044
night terrors,
anything like that?

80
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,550
Gloom is your business,
and business is good.

81
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:10,512
You were shot, Anthony,
by a member of your family.

82
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,222
I know.

83
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,891
And unless I know
absolutely nothing

84
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:17,269
about what I'm doing,

85
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,938
I think you and I'll
have a lot to talk about.

86
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,569
Are you familiar
with the term

87
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,529
"post-traumatic stress"?

88
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,239
I get it, okay?

89
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:32,242
My uncle tried to kill me,
for the second time.

90
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,329
Three strikes
and I'm out, right?

91
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,874
Who knows? Maybe I
am suppressing things.

92
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,084
But for right now,
I feel like each day is a gift.

93
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:43,378
I told my sister.

94
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,255
And that's how
it's gonna stay.

95
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,508
Fair enough.

96
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,636
Is there something
else you'd like to talk about then?

97
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:55,307
Let's pick up where
we left off before this all happened.

98
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,725
A.J.

99
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,810
Believe it or not,

100
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,563
things have gotten
worse with that kid.

101
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:05,609
Flunked out of college.
He waited till I was in a coma.

102
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:09,571
Didn't you leave Seton Hall after
a semester and a half?

103
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,239
All right, fine,

104
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:14,451
but why can't he copy
some of the good things about me?

105
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:17,412
- Does he have a job?
- Blockbuster.

106
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,414
First stop
on the shitbird express.

107
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:23,043
In some ways, this horrible shooting
may provide an opportunity

108
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:26,087
for him to learn
from your mistakes.

109
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:28,048
My mistakes...

110
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,217
I got caught up
in domestic violence.

111
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,552
You think it can't happen
to you, but it does.

112
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,679
But I was referring
to the bigger picture:

113
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,598
The ready access
to guns,

114
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,267
the use of violence
to solve disputes

115
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,937
because of the nature
of your work, your uncle's work.

116
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:45,232
I told you I didn't want
to talk about my uncle.

117
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,943
Fine, but for now
is it safe to say

118
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,737
that there are worse
ways to earn money

119
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,865
than by stocking shelves
at Blockbuster?

120
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,161
Yeah, there are.

121
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,460
- Come on, you in or what?
- Don't fuck with my concentration.

122
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,630
I've warned you before.

123
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:12,759
What is it?
800 more?

124
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,179
Fuck it. Fold.

125
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,890
Cards.

126
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,980
Oh! There's the skip.

127
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,315
Back with a vengeance.

128
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:29,359
- You look great.
- How are you?

129
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,820
Welcome home, T.

130
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,322
- Come here, you malingerer you.
- Easy, easy, easy.

131
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,032
(LAUGHING)

132
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:40,036
- Great to have you back, T.
- Fucking great to be back.

133
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:43,164
- Sit, Ton', I'll clear your spot.
- We got you your bialy

134
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,750
as soon as we heard
you were coming in today.

135
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,544
Nuke that joe
so it's hot.

136
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,556
Oh, fuck.

137
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,058
The onions...
I can't.

138
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:04,019
Oh, scoop out
that bialy.

139
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,104
- I got it.
- Sorry.

140
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,607
I got it, Ton',
no problem.

141
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,070
There you go. I'll get your coffee,
and you're all set.

142
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:19,075
So the municipal
swimming pool...

143
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:21,369
- the bid start on that yet?
- I got a lunch tomorrow.

144
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:23,371
That guy Deutsch
from the planning commission.

145
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,957
Antibiotics.

146
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,044
I had that with the spleen.
Staves off the infection.

147
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:32,297
Spleen, my ass.

148
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:35,550
Beat this.

149
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,428
- Oof, Madonn'.
- Fuck that.

150
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,472
- Check out this bad boy.
- (GROANING)

151
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:45,810
I had the plastic surgeon,
Taschlin, do the outside sutures.

152
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:52,067
Plepler, the head trauma man,
he did the inside work.

153
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:54,778
He dealt with the sepsis.

154
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,905
I was the first guy
at the hospital to have the VAC.

155
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,240
It's an open-incision
situation.

156
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:02,952
It's a better way to heal.
Less pulling on the outer dermis layers.

157
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,289
The thing is with all the Ativan
and the Dilaudid I was taking,

158
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:09,793
intestinal blockage
was a constant fucking problem.

159
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,212
- So in the long run...
- There's your coffee, Ton'.

160
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,464
- Yeah.
- Ton', with your medicine,

161
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:15,715
you want I set my watch
so you don't gotta worry?

162
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,592
Nurse Betty over here.

163
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,011
When my mom had the lupus,
God rest her soul,

164
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,013
'round the clock care
I gave that woman.

165
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,349
Medicine, food, lifted her
in and out of the tub.

166
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,227
- The man's trying to eat.
- I'm just saying.

167
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:31,564
Another life I might have gone
into health care. I actually enjoyed it.

168
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:34,067
How about a bandage over your mouth
then? We're trying to play.

169
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,945
You can lift a grown
woman out of a tub?

170
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,822
Isn't it ironic?

171
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,824
Fucking hospital stay
like mine,

172
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:43,910
you lose goddamn
muscle mass, not fat.

173
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,830
Fucking believe it?

- Same game, five-card calls?

down, Sil.

own neuropsychologist

180

evidence of dementia.

Evidence consistent
with dementia.

182

Nonetheless, I'm going to
recommend he be sent

183
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:15,817
to a prison psychiatric
facility for further evaluation.

184

He'll only be warehoused
in a public facility.

that Mr. Soprano be sent

- to a private locked facility.
- Why not a resort in Antigua?

improved so you can put him on trial?

he can get better.

He sends his regards.

him a favor, though.

him for something he can't refuse.

- So did you?
- No.

- You should ask not to do this.
- I already fucking agreed.
