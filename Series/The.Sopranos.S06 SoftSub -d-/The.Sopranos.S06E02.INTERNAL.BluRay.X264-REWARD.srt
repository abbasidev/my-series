- He came out of the coma for a minute.

174
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,557
They took
the breathing tube out.

175
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:49,684
That's good, right?
That means he's breathing on his own.

176
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,312
They had to put
the tube back in.

177

- Goddamn Junior.
- Anthony Soprano is not going to die.

Van Helsing, let's go.

187
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:24,719
- I'll take him.
- I got it.

188
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,764
- He's on my way.
- Bullshit, you live in Bellevue.

- You already bought the sfogliatelle!

191
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,779
Got him back on the ventilator,

192
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:46,115
The bullet didn't just tear up the
pancreas, it impacted the gall bladder.

Sepsis is the big problem.
An infection in the blood.

194
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,663
I've got him sedated
and restrained

195
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,456
so he can't pull his
breathing tubes out.

196
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,917
- Okay, then what?
- As we discussed before,

197
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,044
we're probably not looking
at a very good outcome here.

198

Should we call Dr. Plepler?

I'll let him know.
And Taschlin too. He'll stop by.

that it certainly wasn't
intentional...

337

and disoriented.

- My nephew Anthony?

- That's why you're here in custody.
- Where's Mel?

relating to yourself,

but about the family.

355
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:28,007
- Yeah, Vito.
- The sports book in Roseville.

356
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:30,468
By rights, that should
go to me now.

He's in jail.
That puts him out of our reach.

were you that night?

out of everything lately.

Roseville's been Junior's
territory since the Big Bang,

374
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:32,571

now that Junior's out of the picture.

you're going to be fine too.

when you had that MRI.

483
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:33,969

at me when we got separated.

00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:37,597
And you were right.
That was a horrible thing to say.

00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,535
Yes, it's been rough between us.

490
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:03,081
I don't know, our hearts
get so hardened

00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:05,250
against each other.
I don't know why.

492
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:17,054
But you are not going to hell.

493
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:23,477
You're coming back here.

Mr. Finnerty,
sorry it took so long,

496
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,676
but I saw some things
on the CT scan I didn't like,

497
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:59,971
which is why I ordered the MRI.

498
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:06,311
How long have I been here?

499
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:08,355
In looking at your MRI,

500
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,357
see these dark areas?

501
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:13,860
These are parts of your brain that have
been oxygen deprived.

00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:17,864

- What?

504
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:24,121
You're going to want to see
a neurologist when you get home,

505
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,791
but the radiologist here
has seen the studies and he concurs.

00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:48,019
It's a death sentence.

512
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:51,731
You're a smurf for 10 or 15 years and
then you die

513
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:53,817
shitting in your pajamas.

514
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,652
I know people with Alzheimer's.

515
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,738
Mr. Finnerty, talk
to your own docs back home.

516
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:01,032
My name's not even Finnerty.

517
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,244
I lost my wallet and my briefcase,
and I picked his up.

518
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:08,123
So you guys took out
his insurance card from his wallet.

519
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:11,293
- How's that float your boat?
- Well, what is your name?

520
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,504
What does it matter?
I'm not going to know myself soon.

521
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,844
You can rest here a while.

522
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:24,181
You're fine other than
the minor concussion.

523
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:27,350
Fall like that could have
broken your neck.

524
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:35,192
I'm lost.

525
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,152
AJ wanted to come but he got

526
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,654
a really bad stomach flu
from a burrito.

527
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:45,869
Law firm's being so understanding
about me taking time off

528
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,455
from my internship to be here.

529
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:56,546
Finn's coming out.

530
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:59,007
He really likes you.

531
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,728
I was reading this morning
and I found this.

532
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,439
I want to share it with you.

533
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:17,901
By Jacques Prevert...

534
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,903
"Our Father which art

535
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:23,490
in Heaven, stay there,

536
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,492
and we shall stay on Earth,

537
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,119
which is sometimes so pretty."

538
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:59,526
Look, I took some Pepto-Bismol.

539
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,676
How much do you know
about the Prius?

540
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:29,931
I could've been naked in here.

541
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:32,851
You need to familiarize
yourself with hybrid cars, Meadow.

542
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:35,520
It's important.
This is the conversation of the future.

543
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:38,231
Why are you breaking my balls
about hybrid cars?

544
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,317
I don't give a shit.
I've been up all night.

545
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,319
Oh, you're tired?
Poor you.

546
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:44,321
You never give two fucks
about the environment.

547
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:46,072
Is that what's crawling
up your butt?

548
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,658
That I was at the hospital
last night when you told Mom you'd come?

549
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:51,369
I didn't say one word to you
about it and neither did anyone else.

550
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:53,663
We're all so glad you fucking
kicked your stomach flu, okay?

551
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,373
I saw how you looked
at my plate of food.

552
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:57,042
I can't eat at my own house?

553
00:38:57,209 --> 00:39:00,086
I wasn't looking at your plate.
It's all in your mind.

554
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:22,150
Don't you find this
completely embarrassing?

555
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:23,485
What?

556
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:25,862
This, our family.

557
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,823
Our father gets shot
by our goober fucking uncle?

558
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:31,576
- What is that?
- Yeah, it's embarrassing.

559
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:34,913
I don't want to think
about what Finn's parents are saying.

560
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:38,375
I mean, I don't really give
a shit about my friends.

561
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:42,337
They know what Dad does, but like,
some of them remember Uncle Junior.

562
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:45,131
He was always a fucking mummy.

563
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:47,675
- Why did Dad hang out with him?
- You know Dad.

564
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:50,720
He takes those things
seriously, all the Italian family stuff.

565
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:54,057
Yeah, I got the big lecture.
Now look.

566
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,101
I know.

567
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:59,687
Look at these fucking reporters.

568
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:05,735
Hey!
Fuck you!

569
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,779
I'll be glad to sit with Tony.

570
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:10,907
Hospital rules, it's family
only for now, but thank you.

571
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:17,247
Angie phoned.

572
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:20,333
Guess she's very busy over there
with her body shop.

573
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:23,711
- You want some grits?
- Huh-uh.

574
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:25,463
Oh, look who's here.

575
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:28,299
Hey Fabio, I'm available.

576
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:31,761
So what? Now there's
an actual roster

577
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,805
of who stays with Dad
and when, and I'm not on it?

578
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:36,599
Frankly, AJ, I didn't think
you'd be interested.

579
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:39,102
I was sick and I've
been trying to study,

580
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:42,230
which is what everybody's usually
hassling me about 24/7.

581
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:44,566
I guess there always
has to be something, right?

582
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:46,985
Come here and sit down, okay?

583
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:54,159
"Studying."
He goes clubbing in New York.

584
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:58,204
Well you cut him too much slack.
You still protect him.

585
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:01,416
I know he avoids Tony because he
can't face seeing him like this.

586
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,751
- It frightens him.
- It frightens everybody.

587
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:05,837
He should get a pass?
You know kids his age

588
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,797
are getting blown up in Iraq.

589
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:10,049
You know something
that's interesting? Janice noticed

590
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:13,678
that when AJ talks about Tony's
possibly not coming out of this,

591
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,138
he can't even use
the word "dad."

592
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,807
He says "Anthony Soprano
is not going to die."

593
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:21,436
Well, that's a fascinating
psychological nugget,

594
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,146
but it don't change the fact

595
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,482
that if that kid
don't pull his end in this,

596
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:28,234
he's never going to forgive
himself and nobody else should either.

597
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:32,322
It's just that Tony has
always loomed so large for AJ.

598
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:35,742
Well maybe it's just that AJ is a
selfish boy who doesn't give a shit.

599
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:39,954
I'm sorry your son
is no longer with us

600
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:43,166
but don't use mine as a guinea pig
for your ideas on parenting.

601
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,168
I never saw you
take a hard line.

602
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,921
Why do you think I'm talking
to you like this?

603
00:41:57,097 --> 00:42:00,850
The thing is,
Tony has an open incision.

604
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:04,395
If you are there in the room
and they change the dressing,

605
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:07,190
it's very hard to take.

606
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,484
And I don't know
that AJ should see that.

607
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,876
Hey!

608
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:29,921
Get the fuck off the property!

609
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:33,049
Hey! I warned you yesterday.
The curb line is your limit.

610
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,805
I know.
I know you hate it.

611
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,976
I'm not going to tell
you what to do, Finn.

612
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:46,813
How would you describe your husband's
relationship with his uncle?

613
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:50,900
Were they close?

614
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:53,027
You know of any issue
they might have been having?

615
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:55,738
I don't speak with Junior.
I haven't for years.

616
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:59,033
My husband knows how I feel
and he never brought him up.

617
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:01,119
What was your conflict about?

618
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:03,454
It's not something
I'm going to discuss with you.

619
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:05,832
Your husband ever talk about
Junior Soprano's mental state?

620
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,043
You're flying full-fare coach?

621
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:11,045
I did hear him
telling other people

622
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:13,881
how Junior was getting
more and more confused...

623
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:16,926
calling my husband Johnny,
which was his father's name;

624
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:19,095
resisting getting a haircut,
that kind of thing.

625
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:22,390
You spoke with your husband
what time of the night of the incident?

626
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:23,933
- I... I don't know.
- I'm not bailing.

627
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,727
Meadow, could you?

628
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:28,855
- I'm just trying to understand.
- Understand what?

629
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:32,317
You're coming out from California
to support me with my father being shot

630
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:35,486
or because dental school
is just sucking for you.

631
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:37,238
Both.
Is that so awful?

632
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:41,159
If you have any more questions
you're going to have to call my lawyer.

633
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:44,787
When he was taken into custody,

634
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:47,290
Junior made pointed references

635
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:51,544
to the McGuire Sisters,
Sam Giancana.

636
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:54,631
- You mean the Kennedy assassination?
- Yeah.

637
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:56,215
You mean as related to this?

638
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:59,719
- I had to ask.
- My husband was three years old.

639
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:16,653
Oh, I could sleep right here.

640
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:43,096
It's all right.
He'll be okay.

641
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:08,389
The Shelby GT 500?
450 horsepower.

642
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:12,018
Oh baby, and this guy
on campus has one?

643
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:14,312
And the Mustang's not
as expensive as the M3

644
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,106
I used to talk about
getting all the time.

645
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:30,077
Jennifer, another round
when you get your chance.

646
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:36,667
Chris!

647
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:40,379
Oh, Ahmed.
You guys here again?

648
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:42,548
You ought to put up a tent
on this fucking bar.

649
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:45,343
How's Tony?
The girl said he was hurt pretty bad?

650
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:48,471
- He's keeping his dick up.
- His uncle did this to him?

651
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,348
I was saying to Muhammad,
why the hell...

652
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:51,974
Not something we talk about.

653
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:54,894
Please, give Tony our best
when you talk to him.

654
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:57,438
I will.

655
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:42,733
Hey, Dad?

656
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:49,782
I'm going to get
Uncle Junior for this.

657
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,909
Don't worry.

658
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:57,039
I watched since I was little
how nice you were to him.

659
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:02,044
And he doesn't just get
to do this to you,

660
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:05,298
put you in here
and get away with it.

661
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:10,761
You're my dad.

662
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:16,142
And I'm going to put a bullet
in his fucking mummy head.

663
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:20,396
I promise.

664
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:22,523
I can't believe
we're not going to like,

665
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:24,692
do stuff together again.

666
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:29,530
'Cause we will.

667
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:31,574
I'm positive.

668
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:39,749
Hey.

669
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,584
Hey.

670
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:44,128
How's he doing?

671
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:49,675
Hi, Dad.

672
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:58,142
The doctor knows.

673
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,353
The Chinese guy.

674
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:03,940
He's calling the other guy to get
permission to change the medications.

675
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:07,401
I'll stay if you want
to pee or anything.

676
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:22,458
Hi.
How's he doing?

677
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:24,877
They didn't come back
with the fever medicine yet.

678
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:26,420
I'm so proud of you, AJ.

00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:28,297
You can't imagine how much
this means to your father.

680
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:31,008
Who knows what it means?
He just lies there.

681
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:33,678
Well, it means a lot to me then,
how about that?

682
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:37,139
Thank you for doing it.
You've helped your family tremendously.

683
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,481
I flunked out of school.

684
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,900
I ended up with a 1.4
for the quarter

685
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:50,820
and the freshman dean said
there was no point in coming back.

686
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:54,031
- With your father in a coma...
- I didn't tell Dad.

687
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:57,493
- Be positive, everybody said.
- My God.

688
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,161
I tried really hard
in philosophy,

689
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:01,622
- but that professor...
- With your father in a coma!

690
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:08,671
Go have breakfast.

691
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:51,505
Anthony.

692
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:55,926
Anthony, can you hear us?
