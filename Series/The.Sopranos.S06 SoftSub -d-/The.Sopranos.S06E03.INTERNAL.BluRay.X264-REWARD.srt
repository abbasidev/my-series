00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:07,236
And what if Tony takes a turn
for the worse?

349
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:10,072
I'm gonna hand her $100,000,

350
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,075

351
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,077
Be money down the drain.

352
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:18,038
It's tempting,
but you can't think that way.

353
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,545
You all set now?

354
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:27,548
Yeah, I'm living it up here.

355

You still stewing
about that money?

356
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,343
Spend some, you'll get over it.

357
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:33,929
I'll never get over it.

358
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:36,515

let me tell you.

359
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:38,350
Oh, come on, not Sil again.

360
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,853
Carmela.
He's a fucking vegetable.

361
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,981
But I still gotta pay
tribute to the princess of Little Italy.

362
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:48,152
- The boss' wife. What are you gonna do?
- Fuck her.

Yeah, good, and you might want to take
care of that thing we talked about.

366

That big piece of pie
you were bringing to the hospital

She's expecting you,
so make it happen.

I'm fucking dealing with here.

371
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:19,266
I resent that.

taking orders from me?

Don't get in bed with him again.
You dislodged his drains.

doing out there?

381

- A lawsuit?
- Could create problems later.

383
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:33,340
What kind of lawsuit?

384

- Also...
- What?

386

I fell down some stairs.

00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,643

389
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,356
What did he say?

390
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,775
"Mild concussion," he said.

391
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,777
Told me I'd be okay.

392

That's it.

JT, I want to introduce you
to Carmine Lupertazzi

398
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,143
my co-executive
producer on the project.

399
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,979
Nice to finally meet. I heard tidbits
of what Chris has got in mind...

400
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,814
the genre and so forth.

401
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:33,025
But, JT, I gotta warn you,

402
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,903
I'm very hands-on.
I learned that the hard way.

403
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:40,407
I wanna welcome all
of you to the first meeting

404
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:42,618
of possible investors
on this project.

405
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:46,872
Some of you know I've had nine pictures
under my subspecies,

406
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,124
four in the "South Beach
Strumpet" series alone,

407
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:53,295
each with 30,000-plus
DVDs in print.

408
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:55,089
That being said, I usually find it
helpful at this stage

409
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:57,508
to include my
prospective partners

410
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:02,429
and get your inputs
or notes as we call them.

411
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:04,723
JT, you're on.

412
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:09,478
Well...

413
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:12,606
we've been working on a new
kind of slasher film.

414
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:14,817
It takes place
in the world of...

415
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,568
you know...

416
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:20,698
um, the mafia.

417
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:24,118
It's about a wiseguy with a big mouth
and bigger dreams.

418
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:29,081
Anyway, they call him
"The Butcher."

419
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,750
- No, they don't.
- Why the fuck not?

420
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:35,337
Need I remind you
of a certain butcher out of A.C?

421
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:36,839
Right.

422
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:38,799
Not "Butcher."
Go on, JT.

423
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,343
So, right.

424
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:44,221
He's kind of
outshining his boss.

425
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,433
So the guy has him clipped,
but he's still alive

426
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,309
when they cut him up.

427
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:51,603
He's gonna feel
that the next day.

428
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:55,566
- Right. So at the dump,
- (ALL LAUGH)

429
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,152
his body reassembles itself,

430
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,154
all except for
a hand that got crushed.

431
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:03,657
So he ties a cleaver
onto the stump

432
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:06,910
and he goes out
to get revenge on everyone,

433
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,997
especially the boss, which
is a pretty solid role.

434
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:13,417
Right now it's called
"Pork Store Killer."

435
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,669
But I'm thinking...

436
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,963
just...

437
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,007
"Cleaver."

438
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:25,179
I'm confused.
You said he's dead.

439
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:29,516
How's he evening up with anybody?
He's a ghost?

440
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:32,436
As I understood,
a zombie of sorts.

441
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,438
Great title, by the way.

442
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:36,607
But if they jointed him,

443
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:40,235
he's not gonna end up
all in the same dump.

444
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:42,738
- And how's that a slasher film?
- What are you talking about?

445
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:45,949
A slasher.
A couple of kids naked in a lake.

446
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,869
Certified maniac
on the loose, not a ghost.

447
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,872
Actually, the maniac is almost always
a supernatural force.

448
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,333
Freddy, Jason, Michael Myers
from "Halloween."

449
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,043
Get the fuck out.

450
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:58,837
Easy, Sil, easy.
He's making a point.

451
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:02,007
Michael Myers is
an escaped mental patient.

452
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:03,967
Jason and Freddy,
different kind of movie.

453
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,011
Well, that's the kind
we're doing here.

454
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:09,515
"Saw," "The Ring"...they made millions.
And that's not even including

455
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:11,558
"The Godfather" angle,
which we got here.

456
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:14,061
What if...

457
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:19,691
they disposed him at stops

458
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:22,694
that happened
to be along the same route?

459
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:25,531
Then he would all end up
in the same dump.

460
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:31,328
But he's a ghost?
I don't know.

461
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:34,122
"Ghostbusters"...another fucking
money machine.

462
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,920
Cavalry's here.
I brought some cannelloni.

463
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,421
Again.

464
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:43,757
It's got bechamel on it,

465
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:46,093
so five, six hours
out of the fridge, tops.

466
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:47,970

00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:50,013

is that what it means?

some face time with the skip?

- Well, of course they did.

00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:36,513
I need an answer already.
I'm going out of my fucking mind here.

521
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,265
I'm liable to do
something drastic.

522
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:41,226
Calm the fuck down.
Let me think.

523
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:47,774
- Mornings are better.
- (WHEEZES)

524
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:52,446
I'll come up with a solution.

525
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:55,115
I don't want you
to worry about it.

526
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:56,158
(COUGHS)

527
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:03,123
I must have sounded odd
at the supermarket the other day.

528
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,711
See, you're Tony's therapist.

529
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,130
Whether it's appropriate...

530
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:13,592
How can I help you?

531
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,969
It's about my son.

532
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,847
Both kids, really.

533
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:23,060
The situation with the shooting.

534
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:25,062
I'm very worried about them.

535
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,147
Sure.

536
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:30,942
It's a very serious problem,

537
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,361
you know, guns in the home.

538
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:35,822
It's a societal concern.

539
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:39,576
Obviously, we learned
our lesson too late.

540
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:42,621
I immediately removed
all the firearms from the house

541
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:45,874
after the goings-on
at Tony's uncle's.

542
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:50,170
Anyway, last night,
I was shrieking

543
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,798
at my son,

544
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:56,343
and I said something very cruel.

545
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:03,100
And especially since
he's been trying so hard...

546
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,311
How are you doing?

547
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:10,607
You know,
I'm frazzled certainly,

548
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,859
but I am more
worried about them.

549
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:15,237
They're not kids anymore.

550
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:17,239
When they were young,

551
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:19,991
there were certain things
we could tell them about Tony's life.

552
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:22,911
You know, lies.
We'll just call them what they were.

553
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:26,832
- But now...
- So the issue isn't just

554
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,792
guns in the home.

555
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:38,051
Honestly, I think about my son
in front of those cameras,

556
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:40,011
having to vouch for all this.

557
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:42,973
My daughter and her friends.

558
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:47,561
They have to face
all these years of facading.

559
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,939
They do or you do?

560
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:55,986
The minute I met Tony,
I knew who that guy was.

561
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:59,614
On my second date, he brought me
and my mother each a dozen roses

562
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:02,534
and my father
a $200 power drill.

563
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:07,247
Not the typical story
of young love.

564
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:13,086
And I don't know
if I loved him in spite of it...

565
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:19,009
or because of it.

566
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:24,556
My parents weren't like that.

567
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:27,392
And I knew, whether
consciously or not,

568
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,060
I knew that behind
that power drill,

569
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:30,979
there was probably
some guy with a broken arm,

570
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:33,106
you know, or worse.

571
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:37,068
And you coped with that, how?

572
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:41,448
I'd go to my priest,
and I would cry,

573
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,284
and say how bad I felt
about how my husband made his money,

574
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:47,454
but that was bullshit.

575
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:50,457
Because there are far bigger crooks
than my husband.

576
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:58,757
But the kids...

577
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:02,594
they don't decide
who they're born to.

578
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:05,972
So now what?

579
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:11,311
Yeah, that's just it.
Now what?

580
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:15,440
It's all out in the open now,
the whole thing.

581
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,692
And them, they're not
in grade school anymore.

582
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,694
They become...

583
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:23,448
the longer they stay with us...

584
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,450
Complicit.

585
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:28,411
Oh, God.

586
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:38,672
Putting aside the moral

587
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:41,758
and legal issues,

588
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:45,345
clarity can't be a bad thing.

589
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:48,014
Yes.

590
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:57,565
Tony's second night
in the coma, I told him I loved him.

591
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:02,821
When was the last time
I said that?

592
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:12,747
Are you afraid you aren't
going to feel that way

593
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:14,749
when he wakes up?

594
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:22,257
Anthony tells me
things have been...

595
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:23,883
better between you.

596
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,727
Come here, honey.

597
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:35,687
It's okay, honey.
You're gonna be okay.

598
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:38,148
I can't breathe.

599
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:41,443
- It's all right.
- Come here, honey.

600
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,737
Can't breathe.
Can't breathe.

601
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:52,037
It's okay, honey.
You're gonna be okay.

602
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:55,206
- What's going on?
- Would you move your car, please, sir?

603
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:58,043
Sil, I didn't hear from you.

604
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,590
Sil's on the canvas now.

605
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,717
Fucking 100% disaster.

606
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:08,345
Point is, Tony goes,

607
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,347
let's face it,

608
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,766
somebody's gonna have to
step into the breach.

609
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:16,144
I'm a young man.

610
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:19,022
Now without the weight,

611
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,775
I'm a healthy man

612
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:23,860
with longevity.

613
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,996
I hear Sil
is at St. Barnabas.

614
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:37,165
My God, what is
happening to us around here?

615
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:40,126
Sil's gonna be fine.
You have enough worries.

616
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:41,920
Listen, sweetheart,

617
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:44,881
you're expecting something,
and I can't get into specifics,

618
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:47,300
and Tony wouldn't want me to,

619
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:51,513
but there are certain people looking
over our shoulders right now.

620
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,515
It's okay, Vito.
I'm not expecting anything.

621
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:57,018
Money's not an issue.
Like you said, I got bigger worries,

622
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:58,770
like this son of mine.

623
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,689
You gotta trust me on this, hon.

624
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:05,860
Suspicions get raised if we were
to move it to you at this moment.

625
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:09,155
I got this.

626
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,825
Your ma says now's our moment.

627
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:14,244
The main thing,
when people come to sit with dad,

628
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,246
the doctors want positive talk.

629
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,832
- It helps in his recovery.
- Got it.

630
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:23,211
Oof, Madonn' he looks terrible.

631
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:26,339
Uncle Paulie,
you can't say stuff like that.

632
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,633
You have to stay positive.

633
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:31,344
Yeah, it's just
nothing prepares you for that.

634
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:33,847
Uncle Paulie!

635
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:37,642
Only one person
at a time, please.

636
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:41,646
She's a ballbuster.

637
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:44,816
Finn's on his way up.
I'll be back in a few minutes, okay?

638
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:47,527
Remember, stay positive.

639
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:14,262
I gotta wear a jock,
the doc says.

640
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,847
Keep the testes elevated.

641
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:21,811
Of course, it could
be a lot worse, right?

642
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:22,729
(SLOW BEEPING)

643
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:25,190
They gave me
an ultrasound, no rupture.

644
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:29,861
I mean, the good thing is

645
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:32,697
I hurt it doing a major
piece of business.

646
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:34,991
I saw a little action,

647
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:38,578
and the next thing,
I was at the urologist.

648
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:39,537
(BEEPING INCREASES)

649
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:41,748
Fucking guy tells
me I can't expect the same things

650
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:44,626
from my body no more.
I tell you, T,

651
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:47,170
first the eyes, then the teeth.

652
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,714
Next you find out
you can't take pissing for granted.

653
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:52,425
Some joke, huh?

654
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:55,678
When I was in the service,
I won the chin-ups cup

655
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,972
three weeks in a row.

656
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,266
Fucking beautiful
definition, too.

657
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:02,644
Guy asked me to model
for the boxing poster.

658
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:07,065
He was half a fag,
but I was flattered just the same.

659
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:09,692
Now look at this.

660
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,903
Fucking wrinkles like
an old lady's cunt.

661
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:18,952
You don't think it's gonna happen
to you, but I'm feeling it, Tony.

662
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:27,085
Phineas Fogg back in town.

663
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:29,087
He forgets
all the little people.

664
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:32,298
Hey, Vito,
how's Mr. Soprano doing?

665
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:35,718
Let's hope he
pulls through, huh?

666
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:40,473
Hi.

667
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:46,062
So glad you're here.

668
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,815
I'm gonna let
you two lovebirds be.

669
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:56,447
That... don't worry about him.
He's harmless.

670
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:00,451
That fucking agita, T.

671
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:03,454
I mean, do I blame
myself for this life?

672
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:06,040
The shit that happens,
like with Puss.

673
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:09,127
Standup one day,
FBI rat fuck the next.

674
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:13,006
I felt it here, T.

675
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:15,842
- I felt it right here.
- Will you please shut up in there?

676
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,804
I'm sorry.

677
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:22,223
Yes, the Inn at the Oaks.

678
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:23,766
(TV BLASTING)

679
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:28,313
Left on Jamboree Boulevard?

680
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,898
Out towards the beacon.

681
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:34,694
What is that beacon anyway?

682
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,866
Oh. God damn it!

683
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:41,659
Shut up!
Shut up in there!

684
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:43,202
So I said to Ma...

685
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:45,705
(ALARM SOUNDING)

686
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,874
What the fuck?

687
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,839
Dr. Budraja,
stat to room 3.

688
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:58,009
Nurse, don't leave!
Help!

689
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:03,181
- Out of the way, sir.
- Oh, my God! What's happening?

690
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:06,309
Soprano, V-tach on the monitor.

691
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:08,227
- Thready pulse.
- Take his pressure. Get a board ready.

692
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:11,230
- 80 palp.
- All right, let's bag him.

693
