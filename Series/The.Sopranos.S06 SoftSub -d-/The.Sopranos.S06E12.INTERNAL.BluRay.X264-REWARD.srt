What'd she do that for?

58
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,467
Apparently she got a letter for Ade
from the Salvation Army.

59

- Ade's homeless?
- She made a donation every year

to feed the homeless
on Thanksgiving.

61
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,808
The letter set
Liz off, evidently.

with the woman, but...

64
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:41,942

about Ade in Paris.

she was dead and I had to tell her.

Doesn't change the fact
that Adrianna is missing.

68
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,160
It also doesn't change
the fact that her mother's a bitter lush

69
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,162
- who can't accept reality.
- What reality?

70
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,624
That her daughter couldn't stand her
so she moved away.

71
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,501
That's what you
say to me two weeks

72

moves away to California.

I had to fend for myself

while she was out lookin'
at bathroom fixtures.

102
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,426
So this new one... how come
you don't bring her around?

103
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:34,638
Honestly I would but...

104
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,140
between us, she's black.

105

- You're bangin' a shine?

106
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,270
She's hot too.
Classy.

would matter to Paulie.

108
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:46,107
I'd still have to listen
to all his racial bullshit.

109
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:49,528
Yeah.
She would feel it too.

110

to choose from.

Makes me worried
about my project.

134

- You ruined my dress.
- Save it.

I don't know.

140
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:16,549
Can't stop thinkin'
about fucking you all the time.

141
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:27,727
How can you even like a person
who sleeps with a married guy?

142
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,562
Can we not talk about it?

143
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,482
I rushed in with her.
I thought I wanted it.

144
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,651
You do.

145
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,445
And you're not
giving it a chance.

146
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,447
You'll see eventually
you'll want kids.

147
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:41,783
It'll be good.

148
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,619
I don't want a family with her.

149
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,329
She's got no idea who I am.

150
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,292
She "doesn't understand you"?

151
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,557
As we know, Phil asked me
to arrange this meeting

152
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,058
after the fire in his wire room.

153
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,811
Correction.
You asked me to fuckin' attend.

154
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,647
- I agreed.
- Fair enough.

155
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,441
Now I won't call it
a sit-down because

156
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,110
of the inclement
negative implications.

157
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:20,655
Let's think of it as...
a meeting of minds.

158
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,366
Now for whatever reason,
certain incidents

159
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:27,787
have expired lately that in addition
to being dangerous

160
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,707
could have an adverse impact
on our respective bottom lines.

161
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,878
I know Vito's bottom was impacted
if that's what you're referring to.

162
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,838
Call him what you will, but you're
talkin' about one of my captains.

163
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,966
Captain?
The Good Ship Lollipop, right?

164
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,051
- Phil, please.
- Please, my ass.

165
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,970
The man was a fuckin' disgrace.

166
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,680
Well, before he came
out of the closet

167
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,432
he worked for me.

168
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:48,892
And he put
a lot of money in my pocket.

169
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,226
And yours too.

170
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,021
Talk about earners?
How about Fat Dom Gamiello?

171
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,357
- What about him?
- He's MIA.

172
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,693
A lot of people are concerned
for his well-being.

173
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,653
So what the fuck
would I know about that?

174
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,865

he was last seen in New Jersey.

175

my friend, Rusty,

180

and for reasons
I will discern in time, believe me.

181

my father taught me it's this...

than a gallon of gold.

00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,394

to see is a truce.

195
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,129
- The shooting.
- "Whatever happened there?"

196
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:03,341

Right.

You gonna come over, take me on a date?

- Had to get your attention.

227

Well you had my attention. Now you're
wasting my time. I have to go.

230
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,065
Three and a quarter.
Can I go now?

231
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,359

I thought it had some potential.

meaningful off the asking,

He signed the escrow papers

244
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,776

245
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:11,779

It was so fucking humiliating...

247
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:19,829
and I was so worked up. I just
needed to smooth it out.

worse, given my history.

in there, seriously.

share in there.

and your organized crime thing.

696
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:24,841
That I took an oath

697
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:26,801
that was a sacred oath.

698

into the "Higher Power" part.

Well, me neither.
It's hard.

704
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:50,408
I mostly think of the group
consciousness as a Higher Power.

705
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:55,079
I said to myself that that oath
would be my Higher Power.

706
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:56,831
That would be my strength.

707

730

but while I was in that coma...

731

somethin' happened to me.

732

I went someplace...

733
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:22,995
I think. But I know I never
wanna go back there.

734

And maybe you know
what I'm talkin' about.
