have let you take off the rubber.

I love you.

- Yeah.

Hello.

29
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,405
Mr. Gaultieri,
I'm Father Jose.

30
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:03,283
I'm Mr. Gaultieri.
Where's Father Felix?

31
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,160
Unfortunately he's ill.

32
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,663
He's having bypass surgery.
He asked me to fill in.

33
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,415
You know Mr. Russamano
from the Neighborhood Association.

34
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,501
Sure, Paulie, Chuck,
how you feeling?

35
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,671
He was an altar boy.

36
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:18,340
Ahh.

37
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:21,677
So the Feast
of St. Elzear.

38
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,679
Father Felix brought me
up to speed.

39
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,847
I'd like to hear your
ideas for this year.

40
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,766
Well, there ain't much
to talk about.

41
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,310
It's all done through
our nonprofit corporation.

42
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:32,854
We close the streets
for five days,

43
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:35,315
hire the food vendors,
rides, et cetera.

44
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,317
Day two, we start
the procession,

45
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:39,444
push the statue up
and down the block.

46
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,280
You say a couple
of prayers and that's that.

47
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,615
All's said and done,
you get your end.

48
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:47,369
About that, as I was
telling Mr. Russamano,

49
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:51,623
frankly $10,000
struck me as quite low.

50
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,667
It is what it is.

51
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,670
Look, I'm new here.
I certainly don't wanna rock the boat.

52
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,423
I realize there are
certain neighborhood traditions.

53
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,883
It's just that given the current costs,
we feel an increase

54
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:04,761
- is long overdue.
- What kind of increase?

55
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:07,806
We feel $50,000 would be
a more equitable donation.

56
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,850
- 50?
- Just this year,

57
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,727
we started a soup kitchen
for the homeless,

58
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,395
a reading program
for bilingual children.

59
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,605
There's less help than ever
from the federal government.

60
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,607
You think this feast
pays for itself?

61
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:20,235
Security, electric, sanitation.

62
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,070
- Not to mention fuel costs.
- Yeah.

63
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:25,115
The way it seems
to break down is you spend $18

64
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,409
for a city permit
to close down the street,

65
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,536
charge fees to the vendors

66
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,872
in the thousands
of dollars to lease out land

67
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,582
that you don't even own.

68
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,918
Yeah? Well, it seems to me the church
has plenty in its coffers

69
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:40,255
for all those
pedophilia lawsuits.

70
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,508
The parish's deal was negotiated since
this was Johnny Soprano's feast.

71
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,386
These are different times,
Mr. Gaultieri.

72
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,096
Well, some things don't change.

73
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:51,224
Couple of days, Joe Vella from the Honor
Guard will be by with the float.

74
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:54,061
Transfer the statue
from his niche,

75
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:56,229
pick up the hat and other stuff.

76
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,440
You say things don't change.

77
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,442
This feast was started
over 100 years ago

78
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,361
in a spirit of giving.

79
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,446
Italian immigrants,
the working poor

80
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,574
gave what little money
they had to honor St. Elzear.

81
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,285
He's the patron saint
from my grandparent's town...

82

Ariano di Puglia.

83
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:14,289
Many of those folks gave their gold
wedding bands, which were melted

84
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,375
- down to make the saint's hat.
- Yeah?

85
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,629
The Holy Society
of St. Elzear,

86
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:24,216
of which you are
recording secretary,

87
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,968
has for the past
100 years entrusted us

88
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:29,596
with the care
of that habiliment.

89
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,017
Frankly...

90
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:36,436
I don't feel safe
giving it over this year.

91
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,939
We use it every year.
It's part of the tradition.

92
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,941
I understand, but I'm sorry.

93
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,944
Given the tenor of this conversation,
I sense there's a possible

94
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,570
criminal element
in this neighborhood

95
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:49,324
that could endanger
this precious piece of local history.

96
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:53,453
But for 50 grand,
you wouldn't have that sense.

97
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:56,581
It would demonstrate to me that you
take this feast as seriously

98
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,166
as the people who began it.

99
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:03,004

I'd have to put on

524
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:24,676
a whole repair crew, work 'em all night.
He wouldn't spring for it.

525
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:27,095
Who, Paulie?
What are you talking about?

526
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,222
First off, he wouldn't
pay for my "A" fleet.

527
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,225
I leased that to the Sorghum Festival
down in Atlanta.

528
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:36,688
Okay, the results
of the steroid test are in.

529
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:39,566
- The contestants, they're all clean.
- (LAUGHING)

530
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,861
I want a fair contest here.

531
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:45,530
No biting each other.

532
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:48,908
Ready, set, mangia.

533
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:55,498
Man, we got some race
going on over here, ladies and gents.

534
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,208
Look at 'em go.

535
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:59,919
Hey, cocksucker!

536
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:03,715
You hire some fly-by-night
piece of shit and you don't tell nobody?

537
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:05,884
- Whoa, Bobby.
- What the fuck you talking about?

538
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:07,552
You know what I'm talking
about, you cheap fuck!

539
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,596
Bobby, come on!

540
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:12,307
Everybody wants to get rich,
but you don't scrimp on safety.

541
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:15,685
- Mind your business, Bobby.
- My baby girl was in that car!

542
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:18,229
- You owe me money, Paulie.
- I owe you shit.

543
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:20,648
- My wife's got nerve damage!
- Fuck her, too!

544
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:22,734
- Get the fuck off me!
- Easy, easy.

545
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:26,780
Calm down.
Keep moving.

546
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:38,041
Go ahead, it's over.
Crown the winner.

547
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,794
I was at the feast,
St. Elzear's.

548
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:43,797
The thing for us kids was
to blow powdered sugar

549
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:46,466
on each other from the zeppoles.

550
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:53,223
Thousands of people
either praying or eating.

551
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:58,144
Anyway, my sister
was on this ride

552
00:39:58,312 --> 00:40:01,147
with my niece
when it lurched forward

553
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:03,650
- pretty bad.
- God.

554
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:06,403
He wasn't there, just Elzear.

555
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,780
But he was so busy
getting money pinned to his ass

556
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,990
that he got distracted
and a bolt snapped.

557
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:11,699
(LAUGHS)

558
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:14,119
Were they hurt?

559
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:16,162
You look around, all these people
are lined up for this shit.

560
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:19,332
The kids, adults, families.

561
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,167
Rides.

562
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:23,628
Yeah, they pay money
so they can almost puke.

563
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,755
They scream, they yell.

564
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:28,133
Why do you think that is?

565
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,176
They're bored.

566
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,680
Are you bored?

567
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:42,605
Am I bored?

568
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:47,861
I got shot in the pancreas
and I recovered.

569
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:49,946
No brain damage
from the septic shock,

570
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:52,699
like everybody figured I'd have.

571
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:56,494
You know my feelings.
Every day is a gift.

572
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:59,247
It's just...

573
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:03,209
does it have to be
a pair of socks?

574
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:09,883
I'm joking.

575
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:12,844
I'm joking.

576
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,644
Well, what are you gonna do?

577
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,730
It's the human condition.

578
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,690
What is?

579
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,988
I don't know.

580
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,990
Yeah, this is Peter Gaultieri.

581
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:36,534
I'm calling for the result
of my biopsy again.

582
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:39,037
I'm sorry, sir.
They're still not in.

583
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:41,164
This is cancer
we're talking about.

584
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:44,751
I understand, sir.
You'll have to call back tomorrow.

585
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:54,719
Gimme an espresso...

586
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:57,430
and don't touch
the lemon rind with your fingers.

587
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:04,103
Hello, Paulie.

588
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:06,105
What are you doing here?

589
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:09,442
The home. It's one
of our outings.

590
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,236
So you're still over there, huh?

591
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:13,446
They've been very nice,

592
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:16,533
and your brother's
trying to work out an arrangement.

593
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,702
Is it true what they're saying?

594
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:23,206
Who? About what?

595
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,958
The ride, the one that broke.

596
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,671
You need to make
a novena, Paulie.

597
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:32,465
- Those poor children.
- What are you talking about?

598
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:35,760
You let St. Elzear
go without his hat.

599
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:38,304
Will you listen to this?
Fuck that voodoo, huh?

600
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:41,224
You cursed your mother,
a blessed nun.

601
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,226
She had it coming.
You both did.

602
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,728
I didn't bring you up like that.

603
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:48,565
You're a fake.
That's how you brung me up.

604
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:49,983
Fuck the two of you.

605
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:54,404
Sir, your espresso.

606
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:01,786
So in keeping with this
longstanding tradition

607
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:05,331
of doing everything
ass-fucking-backwards,

608
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:07,500
we are gathered here tonight
for the bachelor party

609
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:10,587
of already-married man
Christopher Moltisanti.

610
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:13,881
(ALL TOASTING)

611
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,050
And like I always say,

612
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:18,303
a man is not complete
till he's married.

613
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:20,513
- Then he's finished.
- (LAUGHING)

614
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,517
Chrissy.

615
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:27,312
- Congratulations. T.
- Thanks.

616
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:44,120
Should we order?

617
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:47,540
- Yeah, what the fuck are the specials?
- Artie.

618
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:55,340
I gotta go, Ton'.
The kids.

619
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:01,012
- Have fun tonight, huh?
- All right.

620
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:05,433
- Specials, gentlemen.
- Pray tell, my good man.

621
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:08,853
I got lamb tonight, grilled, garlic,
little rosemary.

622
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:10,813
Rosemary, I'll eat her.

623
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:13,149
(LAUGHS)

624
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:21,616
Hey, T.

625
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:23,743
You're doing a heck
of a job there, Brownie.

626
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:26,579
Huh?

627
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:28,790
This thing with the ride,
the shit with Bobby,

628
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:30,917
you settle it
and you settle it now.

629
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:33,419
And not just 'cause
she's my sister, either.

630
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:35,421
- Ton', I...
- You put little kids in jeopardy

631
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:38,091
in the hands of some
fucking redneck?

632
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:40,843
Not to mention you leave Little Paulie
alone to deal with the cops.

633
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:44,222
I thought he had it
under control.

634
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:46,224
Let me ask you a question
about the feast.

635
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:48,434
Do we need negative press?

636
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:50,353
With all the competition
out there

637
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,355
for the entertainment
dollar, DVDs,

638
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,732
the Internet?

639
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,859
You're right, Ton'.

640
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,364
What happened to
the regular ride guy,

641
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,825
the guy we used last year?

642
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:07,161
For what he wanted to charge,
I'm getting killed here, Ton'.

643
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:09,205
When your dad
had St. Elzear's,

644
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:11,249
it was a cash cow,
and it was easy.

645
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:13,251
Nowadays, between
paying the church,

646
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:14,919
these Puerto Ricans now,

647
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:17,213
ha, my profit's
shrunk to nothing.

648
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,465
If it don't work
as a business, get rid of it.

649
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:22,468
Not for nothing, but a lot of that feast
goes in your pocket.

650
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:26,556
I got a lot on my mind, T.

651
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:29,726
- I'm sorry.
- Like what?

652
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:32,979
I had a biopsy.

653
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:35,565
I might have prostate cancer.

654
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:40,194
Well, it's a biopsy, right?

655
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:42,697
Nine times out of 10,
these things come back clean.

656
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:46,033
- I don't know.
- What don't you know?

657
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:49,537
Don't work yourself
up into a state like you do, hmm?

658
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:51,748
I've been having headaches.

659
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:54,959
I'm afraid maybe the thing
metastasized.

660
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:57,378
Jesus, will you
listen to yourself, huh?

661
00:45:57,546 --> 00:46:01,090
With all your weird fucking shit about
your body and the germophobias.

662
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:04,886
- You don't know shit yet.
- It's true.

663
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:07,805
I'd rather face 10 guys
with shivs than something I can't see.

664
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:10,683
Exactly. You're too
susceptible to the psychics

665
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:13,603
and the dream messages
and dirty fucking toilet seats.

666
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,688
It's a biopsy.

667
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:17,899
Get a grip.

668
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:20,610
You're right, T.

669
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:23,696
You know, and negative
thinking can help bring this shit on.

670
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:27,742
Work something out
with Bobby, huh?

671
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:30,203
And Eddie Lind's coming down
from Pennsylvania with an envelope.

672
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:31,913
Meet him at the Bing.

673
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,332
You call him, you set up a time.

674
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:44,050
There he is, the bad lieutenant.

675
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:45,676
Hey.

676
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:50,807
I sold mine.

677
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:53,893
$300 for the five cases.

678
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:04,570
Oh, I had a heater
put in the Bloomfield wire room.

679
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:06,823
Guys were complaining.

680
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,242
Well, good.

681
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:12,078
Yeah, yeah, that's good.

682
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,879
What's new with you?

683
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:23,506
Copacetic.

684
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:38,187
(HIGH-PITCHED)
"We're with the Vipers."

685
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:41,023
(LAUGHING)

686
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:45,987
- Fun night.
- Fuckin' A.

687
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:50,533
(STAMMERS)
"Take it easy. Take it easy."

688
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:53,411
10-4.

689
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:56,622
You remember the look
on the other guy's face?

690
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:59,834
Oh, the fucking
Grizzly Adams douchebag.

691
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:11,262
Yeah.

692
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:22,398
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

693
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:27,278
Dr. Cipolla's service.

694
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:29,155
I need to talk to the doctor.

695
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:31,073
- Is this an emergency?
- Of course.

696
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:33,701
Dr. Cipolla's out of town.
Dr. Paglieri's on call.

697
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:35,745
Do you wanna be connected?

698
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:37,830
Nah.

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

700
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:25,127
Hey, buddy boy, how you doing?

701
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:27,880
Any of the girls working yet?

702
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:34,387
- Last day already. God, it goes fast.
- Yeah.

703
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:37,515
St. Anthony's
the week after next.

- (BABY CRYING)
- What's the matter, baby?

705
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:46,023
Can you believe this? After all this,
she wants to go back on that ride.

706
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:48,025
She cried
for three nights after.

707
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:50,403
The ride's closed, baby.

708
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:52,947
Hey, show everybody
how you can walk.

709
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:54,949
Come on, they wanna see.

710
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:56,450
Okay, show 'em.

711
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:59,286
Show everybody how you can walk.

712
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:01,080
Show 'em.

713
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:03,833
(CRYING)

714
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:09,922
Baby, come here, baby.
Come on.

715
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:12,758
Have some candy.
Look, Cracker Jack.

716
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:17,304
Here you go.

717
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,725
(PLAYFULLY GROWLS)

718
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:25,813
Come on.
(LAUGHS)

719
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:27,857
Whoo!

720
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:38,200
Whoa!

721
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:39,952

(LAUGHING)

723
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:47,251
As you can tell
by this outfit, folks,

724
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:50,546
I've picked out something
with a little Norwegian flavor.

725
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:51,213
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

726
00:50:51,256 --> 00:50:53,257
I'd like to play for you
the "Johnny Oslo Shadish."

727
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:55,801
It's a typical Norwegian
dance, and who could do it better

728
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:58,345
than Bobby and Cissy?

729
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:02,683

00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:26,332
What are you watching?

733
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:30,002
The "Lawrence Welk"
program, channel 55.

734
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:43,182
You want some cookies?
