354
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,801
There he is.

355
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,679
You hungry, T? You want,
I'll send the kid for Baja Fresh.

356
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,974
Anything from Phil?

357
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,809
No, not yet.

358
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:14,154
All right, let's dispense with
the 500-pound elephant in the room, huh?

359
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:16,115
My kid tried to off himself.

360
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,284
We all fucking know.

361
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,709
That's it?

362
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:29,837
Nobody's got nothing to say?

363
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:33,632
How's he doing, Ton?

364
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:37,011
They got him under observation.

365
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:39,013
Whatever the fuck that means.

366
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,143
Stupid fuck.

367
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:50,566
Where did I lose this kid?

368
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:53,694
- What did I do wrong?
- Whoa, come on.

369
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,529
Don't blame yourself, T.

370
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:58,073
A lot of pressure on kids today, Ton.

371
00:26:58,241 --> 00:27:00,159
Still, to try to kill himself?

372
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,870
It happens, skip.

373
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:05,039
Happen to your kids?

374
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:07,207
Or yours?

375
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:08,917
They're all different, Ton.

376
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:11,920
My son, Patrick?
I love him to death...

377
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:14,089
...but he can be a moody prick
sometimes.

378
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:17,051
Heather, you know, she was 15...

379
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:18,844
...she went through a rough patch.

380
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:20,512
Jason, same thing.

381
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,848
And he's got the hyperactivity
to boot.

382
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:26,894
My son too. The older one, James.

383
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:28,979
- He tried to kill himself?
- No, no.

384
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:32,941
I don't know, he... He gets the blues.

385
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:37,613
The important thing is
A.J.'s getting the help he needs.

386
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:40,699
Whatever it is, I'm sure
it's a chemical imbalance.

387
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:43,994
Ask me, it's all these
toxins they're exposed to.

388
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,163
It fucks with their brains.

389
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,915
Between the mercury in fish alone...

390
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,751
...it's a wonder there ain't more kids
jumping off bridges.

391
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,401
I can't fucking shake it.

392
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:17,986
Shake what?

393
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:20,948
- I'm depressed.
- Excuse me?

394
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,991
I'm depressed.

395
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:26,078
I'm telling you, don't you start now.

396
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:28,288
- What does that mean?
- It means what it means.

397
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:31,792
I have enough on my plate, I don't need
you adding to it with your bullshit.

398
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,502
Bullshit?

399
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,212
It's an illness.

400
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,798
- And it's fucking hereditary.
- Thank you, I know.

401
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,634
I am intimately acquainted
with the Soprano curse.

402
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,970
Your father, your uncle,
your great-grandfather...

403
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,597
...who drove the donkey cart
off the road in Avellino...

404
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:47,933
...all of it.
What, you think it's a joke?

405
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:51,061
- Am I laughing?
- Then what are you saying?

406
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,484
He didn't get it from my family...

407
00:28:57,652 --> 00:29:00,154
...that's all I'm gonna say.

408
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:03,407
Your family don't even talk.
Your father's so bottled up...

409
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,826
...it's a wonder he's even
got a stomach left.

410
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,286
As opposed to yours?

411
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,913
Least my father was upfront
about what was bothering him.

412
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,291
With a bullet through
your mother's beehive hairdo.

413
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:15,961
I knew it. I was wondering how long
it'd take for you to throw that up at me.

414
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:17,463
You're amazing, you know that?

415
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:20,883
In high school, you were
the happy-go-lucky rascal...

416
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,177
...the comedian, the rapscallion.

417
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:25,304
But all of that was bullshit, wasn't it?

418
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:26,889
Oh, poor you.

419
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:29,099
She got married under false pretenses.

420
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:33,270
You've been playing the depression card
until it is worn to shreds.

421
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,230
And now you've got our son doing it.

422
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:37,524
Card? Card?

423
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:39,860
- You heard me.
- Oh, so it's all me, huh?

424
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,821
Our sonny boy?
You had nothing to do with it?

425
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:46,241
It wears you down, Tony.
That's all I'm saying.

426
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:49,077
Do you have any idea
what it's like to spend day after day...

427
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:51,538
...with somebody who is
constantly complaining?

428
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,375
Fuck you.

429
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,021
It could have been a cry for help.

430
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:19,066
Aren't you listening?
He did cry for help.

431
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,985
He's lucky I came home and heard him.

432
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,154
I meant the botched attempt.

433
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:26,657
On some level, he may have known...

434
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:29,576
...that the rope was too long
to keep him submerged.

435
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:32,204
Or he could just be a fucking idiot.

436
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:34,414
Historically, that's been the case.

437
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:41,713
Me and Carm were
getting along so good too.

438
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:47,386
My father and his panic attacks...

439
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,513
...my fucking demented uncle...

440
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:53,767
...not to mention the other one,
Eckley, the fucking retard.

441
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:57,437
You think there are other reasons
why your son is so unhappy?

442
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:01,275
He's got the world by the balls...

443
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:03,652
...every fucking advantage...

444
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,905
...and he hits one little pothole
and he goes into hysterics.

445
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:12,286
Yeah, I know.

446
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:18,250
I'm not taking the rap,
not completely.

447
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:23,463
She coddled him, his mother.
I said it before.

448
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:27,134
Every little problem, she's right there...

449
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:31,305
...to pick him up and wipe off
his tears on her apron strings.

450
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:34,141
Children need to feel safe.

451
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,810
I'm sure that made him
into the man he is today.

452
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,146
Are you ashamed of him?

453
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,111
Yeah, actually I am.

454
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:50,657
The coward's way out.
Isn't that what they call it?

455
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:55,078
I think whoever said that
didn't understand depression.

456
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:58,123
But you do, don't you?

457
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,136
Where's Dad?

458
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:14,097
Oh, Meadow got rear-ended
on Bloomfield Avenue.

459
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:17,309
- He'll come see you later.
- Is he still mad?

460
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:20,604
He was never mad, A.J.
He loves you.

461
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:27,819
- How long do I have to stay here?
- Dr. Vogel thinks it might be a good idea...

462
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:30,822
...for the time being
just to take a time-out.

463
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,282
Like I'm in preschool?

464
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,172
Did you see Dr. Vogel today?

465
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,216
Today we have group.

466
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:00,227
Did you eat today?

467
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:03,772
I had some turkey. It had no flavor at all.

468
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,733
I'll bring some chicken parm tomorrow.

469
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:10,904
I don't think that's allowed,
on account of all the bulimic girls.

470
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:18,954
So it's front-row mezzanine
at Grey Gardens...

471
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,580
...and the guy says...
Excuse me?

472
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,751
- You're Tony Soprano's kid, right?
- Yeah.

473
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:27,587
Small world, running into you
like this, huh?

474
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,256
I'm sorry, do I know you?

475
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,925
You got a little cream
on your mouth there, sweetie.

476
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:33,927
Be happy to add to it.

477
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,303
- What?
- Excuse me.

478
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:37,431
Lucky guy, her dad.

479
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:40,350
Must be fun tucking her
in at night, huh?

480
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:44,146
- Do you have a problem?
- Not yet.

481
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:47,065
- Would you like one?
- Coco, come on.

482
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:50,986
- What? I'm saying hello.
- Come on, let's go.

483
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:52,904
Hey, best to your dad, huh?

(COCO CACKLES)

485
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:01,913
What the hell was that?

486
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,461
But that is not for you to decide.

487
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:09,880
Don't say anything.

488
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,801
What, are you two talking
about me again?

489
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,642
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

490
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,729
What?

491
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:31,818
Do you know a guy named Coco?

492
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:35,864
- Why?
- She was out on a date last night...

493
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,991
...and he came over
and pulled some crap.

494
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,576
What?

495
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:44,206
- How?
- We were in the city, Little Italy.

496
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:47,417
We were having dessert and
he came up out of nowhere...

497
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:50,670
...and just started saying
all this weird stuff.

498
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:53,173
What kind of weird stuff?

499
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:56,468
How he'd like to tuck me in at night.
Stuff like that.

500
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:57,636
Tuck you in?

501
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:01,056
I could smell the sambuca
on his breath.

502
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:04,476
What exactly did he say?

503
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:09,815
He came up to us and he asked me
if I was your daughter...

504
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:15,153
...and then he said I had
whipped cream on my mouth.

505
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:18,240
Yeah?

506
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:19,991
What else did he say?

507
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,208
It's all right.

508
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,878
It's okay. He's an idiot...

509
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:34,172
...but he's harmless.

510
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,550
I'll talk to somebody.

511
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:45,725
So this boy you're dating,
this man, who is he?

512
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:48,395
You promise not to start
with an inquisition?

513
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:50,856
Will you stop with all
the secrecy, please?

514
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:56,444
- It's Patrick Parisi, okay?
- You're kidding me.

515
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:58,572
That's why I didn't
wanna tell you guys...

516
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:01,074
...and why he didn't tell
Uncle Patsy.

517
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:04,244
I thought he...
Where are you going?

518
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:06,580
Meeting. Sil.

519
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:09,416
We have Vogel later, don't forget.

(DOOR OPENS, CLOSES)

521
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,378
I thought Pat Parisi was engaged.

522
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:14,838
They broke it off.

523
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,090
We kind of hooked up
at the Cleaver premiere...

524
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:19,426
...we started talking.

525
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:23,138
He's changed a lot.
I really like him.

526
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,724
So why the big mystery
all this time?

527
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,310
I knew you and Daddy never liked him.

528
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:31,730
No, it's not that we didn't like him,
it's just...

529
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:38,820
So all those times you told me you were
staying with Kimmie in the city...

530
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:41,156
...I suppose you were staying
at his apartment?

531
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:42,616
Sometimes.

532
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:48,288
Look, there's something else.

533
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,041
What?

534
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:53,960
I've decided not to go to med school.

535
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,755
What? Why?

536
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,340
Oh, it's just too hard.

537
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:01,968
- Isn't anything that's worthwhile?
- You have no idea.

538
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:05,013
- Of course not.
- Don't get sarcastic.

539
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:08,433
I really think it's law for me.

540
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:11,519
I mean, you should hear Patrick
talk about the justice system...

541
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:13,813
...and what it means.

542
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:15,482
It's really inspiring.

543
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:33,708
Obviously Sheila resents me.
I'm dating her father.

544
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:37,379
The sullen looks,
the transference to me...

545
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:39,339
...of her issues with her mom...

546
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,174
As your favorite patient says:

547
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:44,010
"Maybe I should put
my shoe up her ass?"

548
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:47,055
Which patient of mine says that?

549
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,348
Mine, Elliot.

550
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:51,017
Your favorite patient of mine?

551
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:58,441
- He hasn't been in the paper much lately.
- You miss that, don't you?

552
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:01,486
My father was a rabid Untouchables fan.

553
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:02,946
Make of that what you will.

554
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,703
What, Elliot?

555
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,663
I ran into Nancy Duggan last week.

556
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:14,874
- Do you know Nancy?
- Vaguely.

557
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,584
She's on staff at Rikers Island...

558
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:19,421
...works with a lot of sociopaths,
as you can imagine.

559
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:23,425
Anyway, she told me
something interesting.

560
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:26,344
A lot of studies about talk therapy...

561
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:29,639
...as it relates to sociopaths
and criminals...

562
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:33,560
...one of them is the
Criminal Personality...

563
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,563
...conducted by Yochelson
at St. Elizabeth's.

564
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:40,358
Essentially it concludes...

565
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:42,610
...that talk therapy...

566
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:46,489
...while not only being
useless with sociopaths...

567
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,950
...actually serves to validate them.

568
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:54,080
Yochelson says they sharpen
their skills as conmen...

569
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:56,958
...on their therapists.

570
00:38:57,209 --> 00:39:00,253

571
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:02,297
Why are you smirking?

572
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:05,133
- I'm not.
- Oh, really?

573
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:07,427
He showed data.

574
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:10,597
The one-year reconviction rates...

575
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:13,433
...were higher for offenders in therapy...

576
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:16,895
...than for those receiving
no treatment at all.

a big fucking mistake here.

00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:37,684
It's never how I feel.

595
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:43,565
Oh, poor you.
It's all your mother's fault, isn't it?

596
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:46,526
- I didn't say that.
- You're a mama's boy.

597
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,319
You're gonna call me names now?

598
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:50,989
No one is calling anyone any names.

599
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:53,992
How about my confirmation?
You called me an animal.

600
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:57,829
- I did not!
- I was in the garage and you said:

601
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:00,999
"What kind of animal smokes marijuana
at his confirmation?"

602
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,544
He was using illegal drugs
in the home.

603

Did it ever occur to you
that I might have been self-medicating?

605

And how about second grade?

606
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:17,724
You made me show up
to school in that dorky raincoat.

607
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:20,685
I got beat up because of it.

608
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:26,357
You would hole up
in that room for hours.

609
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:31,696
Because I was never really secure
expressing my feelings in that house.

What'd she say?

616
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,272
That it's all a big nothing.

- Life.

those kinds of things...

She said in the end that your friends
and family let you down...

624

...and that you die in your own arms.

that bout of anorexia...

though, didn't she?

- You got a little girl.
- You almost killed the guy.

659
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:31,584
I should've killed him.
I'd have had total support...

660
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:35,254
...but I held myself back!
You were being prudent.

661
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:37,048
Fuck that.

662
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:42,720
I lost it.

but what the fuck?

664
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:48,601
So you go to Phil...

665
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:52,188
...I go with you, hats in hand,
bended knees.

00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:14,127
Why not you?

669
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:16,504

...that this...

00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:01,609
Maybe.

701
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:06,697
This is gonna sound stupid...

702
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:12,078
...but I saw at one point
that our mothers are...

703
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:17,583
They're bus drivers.

704
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:24,257
No, they are the bus.

705
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:27,552
See, they're the vehicle
that gets us here.

706
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:31,264
They drop us off and go on their way.

707
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:33,182
They continue on their journey.

708
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:36,769
And the problem is that we keep
trying to get back on the bus...

709
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:39,146
...instead of just letting it go.

710
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:45,945
That's very insightful.

711
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:48,197
Well, Jesus, don't act so surprised.

713
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:59,333
You know...

714
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:02,295
...you have these thoughts,
and you almost grab it.

715
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:04,755

717
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:14,932
Butch, how are you?

718
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,852
Phil is not accepting visitors right now.

719
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,937
I just talked to him
on the phone, Butchie.

720
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:23,649
I just talked to him in person.
He ain't seeing nobody.

721
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:25,484
What's going on, Butch?

722
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:27,486
I just brokered this thing.

723
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:32,158
He came here to make a peace offering.
A semi-trailer of drills, Makitas.

724
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,493
We don't want your fucking drills.

725
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:37,788
Fuck it. Let's go.

726
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:55,640
That's right, cocksucker!

727
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:58,184
- Go back to New Jersey!
- Phil, what are you doing?

728
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:01,020
Take that piece of shit
and get off my stoop.

729
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:03,022
But we just talked about this.

730
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:05,358
Well, cooler heads prevailed.

731
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:08,152
- Uncle Philly!
- Uncle Philly, my ass.

732
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,696
Will you just come down
so we can discuss this?

733
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:13,991
There's nothing left to discuss, Carmine.

734
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:19,664
I don't understand.

735
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:21,707
Why is he like this?

736
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:30,257
Hey, it's Sleeping Beauty.

737
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:33,427
- I didn't sleep a wink.
- I know, we've been waiting for you.

738
00:49:33,595 --> 00:49:34,804
Have the chess set ready.

739
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:38,057
- He cheats.
- Hello, Honest Abe?

740
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:40,977
- Whatever.
- We just haven't played for so long.

741
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:45,356
- I know, I just got all this stress at work.
- It's cool, it happens to a lot of people.

742
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:47,525
- Really?
- Absolutely.

743
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:49,735
More than half of adults
report experiencing...

744
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:52,238
...some kind of insomnia at least
a few nights a week.

745
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:54,573
We just want you back.

746
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:56,742
- Thanks, guys.
- When you can't sleep...

747
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:12,591
No food in the unit, sir.
