1
00:04:43,993 --> 00:04:45,870
Okay, all set.

2
00:04:52,043 --> 00:04:53,503
Thank you for your patience.

3
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:56,798
Didn't you say that the hearing is,
more or less, a formality?

4
00:04:56,965 --> 00:04:59,092
Well, the real work's
already been done, yes.

5
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:02,345
In that case, I'm fine covering it myself.

6
00:05:02,512 --> 00:05:04,514
Kevin and Paige don't need both
of us there.

7
00:05:04,681 --> 00:05:09,018
That may be strictly true, but we wanna
send the right message, don't we?

8
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:13,690
- I'm just worried about your comfort.
- I find victory laps very comforting.

9
00:05:13,898 --> 00:05:15,191
Heh.

10
00:06:21,758 --> 00:06:23,634
Well done, my friend.

11
00:06:29,432 --> 00:06:30,558
Good morning.

12
00:06:30,725 --> 00:06:35,104
This meeting of the New Mexico State
Banking Board is now in session.

13
00:06:35,271 --> 00:06:38,191
We have Mesa Verde here
with us today...

14
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:41,069
...and they're represented
by Charles McGill.

15
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,529
Nice to have you back, Charles.

16
00:06:44,155 --> 00:06:45,865
Thank you. Good to be back.

17
00:06:46,032 --> 00:06:48,659
I'm here with my colleague,
Howard Hamlin.

18
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:52,080
And may I introduce
Mr. Kevin Wachtell...

19
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:55,083
...president and chairman
of Mesa Verde Holdings...

20
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:58,002
...and Ms. Paige Novick,
Mesa Verde's senior counsel.

21
00:06:58,169 --> 00:07:02,048
Hello, and welcome.
I believe staff has found the application...

22
00:07:02,215 --> 00:07:05,843
...to meet the basic requirements
for approval. That's right, isn't it?

23
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,096
With your permission,
Mr. Wachtell would like...

24
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:10,973
...to make a brief statement
in support of the application.

25
00:07:15,228 --> 00:07:18,731
Mr. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen
of the New Mexico Banking Board...

26
00:07:18,898 --> 00:07:22,235
...I'm honoured and grateful to appear
before you this morning.

27
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:26,489
We believe that our proposed expansion
is in the public interest...

28
00:07:26,656 --> 00:07:29,117
...both for Arizona and our own state.

29
00:07:29,492 --> 00:07:32,745
For 46 years, the men and women
of Mesa Verde Bank and Trust...

30
00:07:32,912 --> 00:07:35,414
...have prided ourselves
on personal service...

31
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:38,334
...and attention to detail,
second to none.

32
00:07:39,377 --> 00:07:44,173
Mesa Verde continues to operate
at a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 11.2 percent.

33
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,969
Uh, hold on. Excuse me, Mr. Wachtell,
just one moment.

34
00:07:48,136 --> 00:07:49,262
Sir, sorry to interrupt.

35
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:53,349
We noticed a fairly significant
discrepancy. See the address....

36
00:07:53,516 --> 00:07:55,893
- What's going on?
- Let's find out.

37
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,397
Mr. Commissioner,
is there something we can clarify?

38
00:08:00,273 --> 00:08:04,610
Uh, yes. Can you give us the address of
the proposed Scottsdale branch again?

39
00:08:04,777 --> 00:08:10,116
Certainly. It's 1216 Rosella Drive,
Scottsdale, Arizona, 85262.

40
00:08:10,283 --> 00:08:14,245
1216. Okay, because the application
I'm looking at today...

41
00:08:14,412 --> 00:08:16,831
...clearly gives the address as 1216.

42
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:18,708
1216. That's correct, sir.

43
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:24,463
But in the original submission,
we're seeing 1261 Rosella Drive.

44
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,507
- It is 1261.
- 1261.

45
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:30,595
I think if you double-check,
you'll see that 1216 is correct.

46
00:08:31,012 --> 00:08:33,181
There seem to be
two different addresses here.

47
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:36,017
Mr. Commissioner, I have a copy
of our notice of intent...

48
00:08:36,184 --> 00:08:39,061
...which was published in newspapers
in Arizona and New Mexico.

49
00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:43,441
- It clearly states the address as 1261--
- Mr. Commissioner, if--

50
00:08:43,608 --> 00:08:49,363
"1261 Rosella Drive." Yes, I have a copy
of the notice of intent too.

51
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:54,619
But on the actual filing,
the address reads "1216."

52
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:57,288
So which is it?

53
00:08:58,122 --> 00:09:01,042
Mr. Commissioner,
if I may confer with my clients.

54
00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:05,671
- Certainly, please.
- It's absolutely 1261.

55
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:10,134
You're mistaken, and with all due respect,
you're muddying the waters here.

56
00:09:10,301 --> 00:09:12,553
Muddying the water?

57
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,765
Look. Just look.

58
00:09:16,057 --> 00:09:18,059
Well, this is clearly an error.

59
00:09:19,018 --> 00:09:21,771
It's 1261.
I know where my own damn bank is.

60
00:09:21,938 --> 00:09:25,483
- Let's all calm down. I'm sure we can--
- I've got a building remodel...

61
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:29,445
...at 1261 Rosella.
I don't know where the hell 1216 is.

62
00:09:29,612 --> 00:09:32,114
I don't quite unders....

63
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:34,700
- 1261?
- 1261.

64
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:37,995
- Is this gonna be a problem?
- No. I'm sure it won't be.

65
00:09:38,162 --> 00:09:41,207
Um, Mr. Commissioner, I apologise.

66
00:09:41,374 --> 00:09:46,295
Unaccountably, there appears
to be a discrepancy in our filing.

67
00:09:46,462 --> 00:09:47,755
So the correct address...

68
00:09:47,922 --> 00:09:50,883
...is the one that appeared
in the notice of intent, the 1261?

69
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:52,677
It would seem so.

70
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:57,014
We'd like to request an adjournment
of just a few minutes...

71
00:09:57,181 --> 00:10:01,352
...so that we can amend the filing
to reflect the correct address.

72
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,273
Well, I can give you
an adjournment, uh...

73
00:10:05,773 --> 00:10:10,861
...but I don't think
we can get you back in today.

74
00:10:11,112 --> 00:10:14,907
If I may, when do you think
you might be able to schedule us?

75
00:10:15,074 --> 00:10:20,788
I'm being told by staff that they've already
done the research for 1216 Rosella Drive.

76
00:10:20,955 --> 00:10:24,458
Our folks are going to have to go back
to square one on the new address.

77
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:28,421
If we could obtain
a provisional agreement today...

78
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:31,007
- ...to allow the branch to open--
- No, no.

79
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:35,136
All due respect, it's up to you folks
to submit accurate paperwork.

80
00:10:35,303 --> 00:10:37,680
Maybe next time double-check.

81
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:41,350
Now, the soonest
we could revisit this matter...

82
00:10:41,976 --> 00:10:45,521
...well, it looks like
six weeks from Friday.

83
00:10:46,272 --> 00:10:47,315
We--

84
00:10:47,982 --> 00:10:50,151
We can't wait six weeks.

85
00:10:50,318 --> 00:10:55,197
Mr. Commissioner, Mesa Verde
has put effort and resources...

86
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:57,908
...into preparing this branch
to open immediately.

87
00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:01,537
However unusual,
a provisional approval...

88
00:11:01,704 --> 00:11:04,165
...would be most appreciated,
most welcomed.

89
00:11:04,332 --> 00:11:06,876
- Time being of the essence.
- Charles, I'm sorry.

90
00:11:07,043 --> 00:11:10,421
I'll see you in six weeks.
That closes the matter for today.

91
00:11:10,588 --> 00:11:14,675
Will staff please note that
Mesa Verde will return in six weeks...

92
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:17,720
...at which time
we will revisit this application.

93
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,138
That's on the schedule now.

94
00:11:19,305 --> 00:11:21,349
And we'll have expedited
all the official research....

95
00:11:22,892 --> 00:11:27,021
This is not possible.
This is not possible!

96
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:30,316
Oh....

97
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:33,819
Oh....

98
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:43,162
"1261." No.

99
00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:45,873
- No.
- Chuck.

100
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:48,292
I don't understand.

101
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:54,131
I don't understand. It was 1216. It was.
I checked! I double-checked!

102
00:11:54,298 --> 00:11:57,968
Chuck, it happened.
Now we take our licks and we move on.

103
00:11:58,594 --> 00:12:01,764
This doesn't just reflect on you.
An office full of associates...

104
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:05,059
...and paralegals let this get by.
I did too, for that matter.

105
00:12:05,226 --> 00:12:07,895
It was 1216, I promise you.

106
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:12,274
Everyone makes mistakes.

107
00:12:27,832 --> 00:12:29,834
This was no mistake.

108
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:59,298
I'm buying a round for the house.

109
00:14:00,633 --> 00:14:03,302
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

110
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:08,182
Hey. Hey, listen up, everybody.

111
00:14:08,349 --> 00:14:11,101
This gentleman's buying a round
for the house.

112
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:14,021
- Yeah! All right!
- Yeah! Whoo!

113
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:19,276
- Come on.
- All right, lift with your knees.

114
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:21,946
What does that even mean,
"lift with your knees"?

115
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:25,741
I don't know. It's something sweaty
people say. Here we go. One, two, three.

116
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:31,747
- Got it?
- Almost, almost, almost.

117
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:34,833
- Got it?
- All right. Right there, go. Go.

118
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,173
You okay?

119
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,802
Nothing a few years
of physical therapy won't fix.

120
00:14:44,969 --> 00:14:47,179
- Okay.
- All right, push.

121
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:53,477
Slow, slow, slow.
Corner, corner, corner.

122
00:15:07,992 --> 00:15:10,286
- Yeah.
- Get that one.

123
00:15:27,553 --> 00:15:30,014
Hi, Paige. How are you?

124
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:34,643
Yeah. I mean, no. No, it's fine.

125
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:37,813
Uh-huh.

126
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:42,151
What?

127
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:46,405
Well, yes. Ha, ha.

128
00:15:46,572 --> 00:15:48,282
Of course.

129
00:15:48,449 --> 00:15:50,242
Right. I understand.

130
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:51,744
Okay.

131
00:15:53,412 --> 00:15:56,373
Yeah, that would be perfect.
I'll see you then.

132
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,793
Great. And listen, Paige, thank you.

133
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:02,212
Thank you.

134
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:10,429
Uh--

135
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,431
Jimmy.

136
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:14,516
What? What's up?

137
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:16,060
I....

138
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:19,938
I just got Mesa Verde back.

139
00:16:22,775 --> 00:16:26,028
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

140
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,114
Holy shit. That's unbelievable.

141
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:31,617
I....

142
00:16:31,784 --> 00:16:34,411
- What happened to HHM?
- Uh, Paige didn't go into it.

143
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:37,581
She just said the filing didn't go through.
We're gonna meet this afternoon.

144
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:38,832
Hey!

145
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:41,960
What did I tell you?
Sometimes the good guys win.

146
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:46,507
It sounds like
there's some regulatory issues.

147
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:49,927
Kevin's still worried that one lawyer
won't be able to handle it.

148
00:16:50,094 --> 00:16:52,137
- You can.
- I'm gonna have to get a paralegal.

149
00:16:52,304 --> 00:16:54,640
Maybe two of them.
I will pay for it out of my end.

150
00:16:54,807 --> 00:16:56,975
No, come on, split it down the middle.

151
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:59,395
I need a Westlaw terminal right away.

152
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:02,022
I don't even know
who to call to get that done.

153
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:05,484
- These are high-class problems.
- But it's a major piece of work.

154
00:17:05,651 --> 00:17:08,237
- This is major.
- Kim, you've got this, all right?

155
00:17:08,404 --> 00:17:12,783
So take a moment. Breathe, savour.

156
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:18,580
- You know what, you're right.
- Damn right I'm right.

157
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:30,968
It's Ernie.

158
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:35,305
Hi, Ernie, what's up?

159
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:40,477
Yeah. No, Paige just called me.

160
00:17:40,644 --> 00:17:41,979
Uh-huh.

161
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:44,690
Did Chuck say why...?

162
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:47,401
So when....

163
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:51,905
Sure. No time like the present.

164
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:53,574
Okay.

165
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:55,325
Thanks.

166
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:57,828
Mesa Verde files.

167
00:17:57,995 --> 00:18:01,039
- Chuck's ready to turn them over to me.
- Wow.

168
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:03,667
Really? That was....

169
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:05,544
- That was quick.
- Yeah.

170
00:18:05,711 --> 00:18:08,589
I'm gonna go change
and get over there.

171
00:18:08,756 --> 00:18:10,424
- You want some help?
- That depends.

172
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:12,968
Are you gonna carry boxes
or are you gonna gloat?

173
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:16,263
Uh, some from column A,
some from column B.

174
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:20,350
Ground yourself.

175
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:23,771
- Sorry?
- Just touch the thing.

176
00:18:28,317 --> 00:18:30,736
Hell, this thing doesn't....

177
00:18:32,196 --> 00:18:34,114
- Hey, Jimmy. Hey, Kim.
- Hey, Ernie.

178
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:37,242
- Something's wrong with the lock.
- Mr. McGill had me call a locksmith...

179
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:40,829
- ...and change them.
- Yeah? Why did he do that?

180
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,336
Hey, Chuck,
why'd you change the locks?

181
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:52,049
Ernesto, I think we're good.
I'm sure you're needed back at the office.

182
00:18:52,216 --> 00:18:54,802
- Well, I'll get going, then.
- Thanks.

183
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:56,178
Bye, Jimmy. Bye, Kim.

184
00:18:56,345 --> 00:18:57,846
- Bye, Ernie.
- See you, Ernie.

185
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:01,183
So, Chuck,
what's the deal with the locks?

186
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:06,063
Kim, I was hoping to have
this conversation with you and you alone.

187
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:11,235
However, I guess it's time
to clear the air once and for all.

188
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,154
Clear the air about what?

189
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,450
He sabotaged me.

190
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,788
- What are you--?
- Please, don't bother.

191
00:19:23,247 --> 00:19:25,999
You and I both know
exactly what I'm talking about.

192
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,043
I don't.

193
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:32,005
Yesterday morning was the
worst professional humiliation of my life.

194
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:36,051
A single transpositional error
cost my client time and money...

195
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:38,887
...and permanently damaged
my reputation.

196
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:43,350
Then I realised it wasn't an error.

197
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:45,102
Not at all.

198
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:50,357
A week ago last night
I was right there on that couch...

199
00:19:50,524 --> 00:19:52,276
...barely conscious.

200
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,987
And Jimmy showed up.

201
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:58,657
And he sent Ernesto away.

202
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:02,703
My brother was gonna take care of me.

203
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:06,832
And in the dead of night,
he went through my Mesa Verde files.

204
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:10,127
- We don't have to listen to this.
- She does.

205
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:12,379
You do.

206
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:14,965
For your own good.

207
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:19,720
Now, in these files are 13 documents
containing the address...

208
00:20:19,887 --> 00:20:22,222
...of Mesa Verde's proposed branch.

209
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:26,393
1261 Rosella Drive, Scottsdale, Arizona.

210
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:31,899
Jimmy pulled each and every one, and
he left me here sweating and delirious...

211
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:34,568
...while he went off to doctor them.

212
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:36,862
You need a photocopier for that.

213
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:39,114
Where'd you go?
Some all-night copy shop?

214
00:20:40,574 --> 00:20:43,744
With a little careful cutting and pasting,
he created duplicates.

215
00:20:43,911 --> 00:20:48,040
Virtually identical to my originals,
but with one key change.

216
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:52,169
1261 Rosella Drive
became 1216 Rosella Drive.

217
00:20:52,336 --> 00:20:54,171
This is sounding like a lot of work.

218
00:20:54,338 --> 00:20:56,632
No one ever accused you
of being lazy.

219
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:58,967
Every other sin in the book,
but not that one.

220
00:20:59,134 --> 00:21:02,804
If you're wondering if Jimmy's up to
a little casual forgery, you should know...

221
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:05,182
...in high school he had
a thriving business...

222
00:21:05,349 --> 00:21:07,684
...making fake IDs
so his buddies could buy beer.

223
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:11,730
- You're going back to high school, huh?
- Hey, you and Mozart, huh?

224
00:21:11,897 --> 00:21:14,149
You both started young.

225
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:18,111
He came back here
and put his new versions in my files.

226
00:21:18,737 --> 00:21:23,742
And then, the next day
my caring brother took his leave.

227
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:27,120
He knew that I would use
his modified documents...

228
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:30,207
...to write Mesa Verde's submission
to the state regulator.

229
00:21:30,374 --> 00:21:37,047
And so I did. Over and over,
I typed 1216 instead of 1261.

230
00:21:37,214 --> 00:21:43,637
I remember thinking, "1216 Rosella
Drive. That's just one year after 1215...

231
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:48,558
- ...the year the Magna Carta was signed."
- Jesus, Chuck, you are unbelievable.

232
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:52,729
So you're saying if we look in here,
all the addresses will be wrong?

233
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:56,149
Well, of course you weren't gonna
leave evidence behind.

234
00:21:56,441 --> 00:22:00,237
I'm guessing yesterday morning
you waited until I left...

235
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:04,241
...then used your key to let yourself in
and returned the originals.

236
00:22:04,616 --> 00:22:07,119
No crime is complete
without the cover-up.

237
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:11,498
Oh, come on.
I did all this, what, for some business?

238
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:16,795
He did it for you.

239
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,677
I'm sure you didn't know anything
about it.

240
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:25,929
I believe he went off on his own...

241
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:29,391
...and did this as some kind of
twisted romantic gesture.

242
00:22:29,558 --> 00:22:32,602
I think you need to lie down
with a cold washcloth on your head.

243
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:36,148
And now that you know,
you have no choice.

244
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:38,275
This is about a client.

245
00:22:38,442 --> 00:22:40,736
A client who has been defrauded.

246
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:44,740
As a sworn officer of the court,
as Mesa Verde's attorney of record...

247
00:22:44,906 --> 00:22:47,451
...you have no recourse
but to go to Kevin Wachtell...

248
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:48,994
...and make a full disclosure.

249
00:22:49,161 --> 00:22:53,623
This whole song-and-dance is all about
getting his client back. That's all this is.

250
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:54,958
Not in the least.

251
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:58,420
- If knowing the truth, they still decide--
- You can't stand the fact...

252
00:22:58,587 --> 00:23:00,338
...that they chose her over you.

253
00:23:00,505 --> 00:23:03,800
I can't stand the fact that my own brother
stabbed me in the back!

254
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:07,304
I can't stand the fact you've deceived
and ruined this fine young woman.

255
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:10,515
Ruined? What is this, the 1840s?
What are you talking about?

256
00:23:10,682 --> 00:23:13,560
- She's not ruined.
- Jimmy.

257
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:21,359
If what you're saying is true...

258
00:23:21,526 --> 00:23:24,237
...Jimmy could be charged
with forgery...

259
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:28,992
...fraud, falsifying evidence,
even breaking and entering.

260
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:31,036
Frankly, I am sick about this...

261
00:23:31,203 --> 00:23:33,413
...but facts are facts.

262
00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:36,625
And what is your evidence?

263
00:23:38,043 --> 00:23:39,669
My evidence....

264
00:23:39,836 --> 00:23:43,298
My evidence is knowing my brother
for his entire life.

265
00:23:44,382 --> 00:23:48,136
Chuck, I think there's another
explanation. It's a simpler one.

266
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:50,388
You made a mistake.

267
00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:53,308
- I did not.
- You're working by lantern light...

268
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:56,019
...squinting over 10-point type
for hour after hour.

269
00:23:56,186 --> 00:24:00,315
Mistakenly changing 1261 to 1216
would be the most natural thing.

270
00:24:00,482 --> 00:24:03,443
- It could certainly happen to me.
- I did not make a mistake!

271
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:07,572
- I believe you did.
- I understand that you have...

272
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:10,784
...great affection for Jimmy,
a great many people do.

273
00:24:10,951 --> 00:24:13,745
- But please open your eyes here!
- You made a mistake...

274
00:24:13,912 --> 00:24:15,789
...and instead of facing up to it...

275
00:24:15,956 --> 00:24:18,500
...you accuse your brother
of plotting against you.

276
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:20,710
You come up
with this elaborate scheme--

277
00:24:20,877 --> 00:24:24,756
- He's capable of this. You know he is.
- I know he's not perfect.

278
00:24:26,341 --> 00:24:28,760
And I know he cuts corners.

279
00:24:29,136 --> 00:24:31,346
But you're the one
who made him this way.

280
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,641
He idolizes you.

281
00:24:34,808 --> 00:24:38,728
He accepts you, he takes care of you.

282
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:42,399
And all he ever wanted
was your love and support.

283
00:24:42,566 --> 00:24:45,694
But all you've ever done is judge him.

284
00:24:45,861 --> 00:24:50,740
You never believed in him.
You never wanted him to succeed.

285
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:56,121
And you know what?

286
00:24:59,457 --> 00:25:01,751
I feel sorry for him.

287
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:08,300
And I feel sorry for you.

288
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:45,045
Jesus. What...?

289
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:48,840
- Aah!
- Kim, what?

290
00:25:51,676 --> 00:25:53,970
Just drive.

291
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:22,249
All right, line up by class!

292
00:26:22,415 --> 00:26:24,417
Find your buddy.

293
00:26:38,848 --> 00:26:40,892
Let's go.

294
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:01,663
- Come on, come on. Plant yourself.
- All right. Here?

295
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:04,541
Yeah, right there. About yea high.

296
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:06,793
Aim it up at me. Heroic.

297
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,671
- Heroic? Good luck with that.
- Just frame me up, all right?

298
00:27:09,838 --> 00:27:12,132
Make sure you get the neck.
It's a low-angle shot.

299
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:13,925
- Okay.
- You know what, let me see.

300
00:27:14,092 --> 00:27:16,761
- It's just base.
- What, am I dying of consumption?

301
00:27:16,928 --> 00:27:19,973
At your age, you don't wanna look red.
It looks like rosacea.

302
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:23,143
- What's with all the...?
- Making it look like you have a jawline.

303
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,644
I do have a jawline.

304
00:27:25,603 --> 00:27:28,148
You know what, you stand in for me.

305
00:27:29,107 --> 00:27:30,150
Okay, crouch down.

306
00:27:30,317 --> 00:27:33,820
Okay, move to your left.
The other left. More, more. Okay. Boom.

307
00:27:34,237 --> 00:27:36,156
That's what I'm talking about.
You got it.

308
00:27:36,323 --> 00:27:38,783
- Gotta be an easier way to get this shot.
- Not for free.

309
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:41,119
You wanna be a filmmaker,
grow a pair.

310
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:43,121
Here we go, picture's up.

311
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:46,291
All right, let's do this. Last looks.

312
00:27:48,543 --> 00:27:50,879
Rhubarb, rhubarb. Nine o'clock.

313
00:27:54,341 --> 00:27:56,718
- Excuse me.
- Hi, are you in charge here?

314
00:27:56,885 --> 00:28:00,680
- Yes, I am, and this is school property.
- You're just the person I wanna speak to.

315
00:28:00,847 --> 00:28:02,098
It would be very helpful...

316
00:28:02,265 --> 00:28:05,685
...if you can get those kids in that building
to keep it down for a bit.

317
00:28:05,852 --> 00:28:09,564
Just give them a worksheet or something.
Just two or three minutes, for sound.

318
00:28:09,731 --> 00:28:13,068
This is school property, and no one
is allowed here without permission.

319
00:28:13,234 --> 00:28:14,319
Of course not.

320
00:28:16,071 --> 00:28:18,907
- You didn't speak to Annette?
- Annette?

321
00:28:19,074 --> 00:28:22,118
- In the superintendent's office.
- Do you know an Annette downtown?

322
00:28:22,285 --> 00:28:24,037
I don't think so.

323
00:28:24,204 --> 00:28:26,915
Well, I'm sorry about the mix-up.

324
00:28:27,082 --> 00:28:30,835
We're shooting what's called
an establishing shot. Five minutes, tops.

325
00:28:31,002 --> 00:28:34,547
You're not shooting anything
until I'm clear on what's going on here.

326
00:28:34,714 --> 00:28:37,467
The documentary.
We're making a documentary. That's--

327
00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:40,929
Oh. I was told there was a display
or a plaque of some kind.

328
00:28:41,096 --> 00:28:44,140
- Would you know where that would be?
- Why would we have a plaque?

329
00:28:44,307 --> 00:28:47,685
- Because of who went to school here.
- Who went to school here?

330
00:28:48,061 --> 00:28:50,855
Rupert Holmes.
That's who the documentary is about.

331
00:28:51,231 --> 00:28:53,858
- I'm sorry. Who?
- Rupert Holmes, you know.

332
00:28:55,068 --> 00:29:00,907
Rupert Holmes, the singer-songwriter.
You know, um, "The Piña Colada Song."

333
00:29:02,075 --> 00:29:03,660
I mean, sure you do. I--

339
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:25,265
- See? Look at her face. Rupert Holmes.
- He went to school here?

340
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:30,145
- Yeah, class of '64. He still talks about it.
- But the school was built in '71.

341
00:29:30,353 --> 00:29:33,314
Mm. He was a student in the old building
that used to be here.

342
00:29:33,481 --> 00:29:36,651
We're taking a little, what do you call it,
artistic liberties.

343
00:29:36,818 --> 00:29:39,654
Isn't Rupert Holmes English?

344
00:29:41,906 --> 00:29:44,909
Well, yeah, and that's some great trivia.

345
00:29:45,076 --> 00:29:49,247
But he spent his formative years
right here in Albuquerque.

346
00:29:50,123 --> 00:29:53,418
Why don't you call Annette down
in the superintendent's office?

347
00:29:53,585 --> 00:29:56,171
We'll just stay here
till you get official word.

348
00:29:56,379 --> 00:29:58,882
- If you don't mind waiting.
- Not at all. Don't wanna break any rules.

349
00:29:59,048 --> 00:30:00,675
Shouldn't take very long, I'm sure.

350
00:30:00,842 --> 00:30:04,387
No promises, but I'll see what I can do
about getting the kids to quiet down.

351
00:30:04,554 --> 00:30:05,930
Ah, that would be super helpful.

352
00:30:16,983 --> 00:30:19,611
Chop-chop. Magic time.

353
00:30:20,236 --> 00:30:23,615
Come on, let's go. No last looks.
The flag, the flag.

354
00:30:24,032 --> 00:30:27,243
- Okay, remember, heroic.
- Yeah, you're a hero.

355
00:30:28,369 --> 00:30:30,455
Gravitas.

356
00:30:31,414 --> 00:30:33,374
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

357
00:30:36,878 --> 00:30:38,046
Go.

358
00:30:38,213 --> 00:30:44,427
Dolly, dolly, dolly. Nice.

359
00:30:44,636 --> 00:30:46,346
Nice.

360
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:04,239
Hey, Mike.

361
00:31:04,405 --> 00:31:09,035
- Hey, Fran, you still serving breakfast?
- For you, sure. The usual?

362
00:31:09,202 --> 00:31:11,204
That'd be great.

363
00:31:23,091 --> 00:31:24,717
- Thanks.
- Mm-hm.

364
00:31:24,968 --> 00:31:26,970
Anything good in the paper?

365
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:30,932
Well, was there ever anything good
in the paper?

366
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:33,101
Heh. Not too often.

367
00:31:33,476 --> 00:31:35,812
- Hey, Fran.
- Hm?

368
00:31:36,771 --> 00:31:38,481
I gotta ask.

369
00:31:40,942 --> 00:31:43,945
- Does it ever snow around here?
- Sure it does.

370
00:31:44,112 --> 00:31:46,781
This gonna be your first winter
in Albuquerque?

371
00:31:46,948 --> 00:31:49,033
Yeah, I'm out from Philadelphia.

372
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,245
Yeah, it depends on the year.

373
00:31:52,412 --> 00:31:55,707
Stay around long enough, you'll have
something to shovel. Don't worry.

374
00:31:55,873 --> 00:31:57,709
That suits me.

375
00:31:57,875 --> 00:32:00,420
I live up in Cedar Crest. We get plenty.

376
00:32:00,587 --> 00:32:03,673
You can shovel my drive
if you're looking for more.

377
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,050
- Say the word.
- Yeah, well....

378
00:32:06,217 --> 00:32:08,136
Pardon me, miss?

379
00:32:08,303 --> 00:32:09,721
Cheque, please.

380
00:32:37,248 --> 00:32:39,917
- Yeah.
<i>- We gotta talk.</i>

381
00:32:51,888 --> 00:32:54,265
I've got something I need to know.

382
00:32:54,432 --> 00:32:56,643
And I need to know it fast.

383
00:32:58,019 --> 00:33:01,481
- What's that?
- We got hit the other day.

384
00:33:02,273 --> 00:33:06,235
A truck headed south got hijacked.
Someone stole a quarter million.

385
00:33:06,402 --> 00:33:09,614
Now Hector is flipping out,
looking for who did it.

386
00:33:09,781 --> 00:33:11,324
Thing is...

387
00:33:12,617 --> 00:33:14,786
...I think it was you.

388
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:19,499
They left the driver hogtied,
not a mark on him.

389
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:24,712
Anyone in the game would've capped
him, but this driver, he's still breathing.

390
00:33:24,879 --> 00:33:28,216
I thought, "Who's the guy who'd
rip off a couple of hundred thousand...

391
00:33:28,383 --> 00:33:31,052
...in drug money and leave a witness?

392
00:33:32,136 --> 00:33:35,765
Who's the guy
who won't pull the trigger?"

393
00:33:37,433 --> 00:33:38,851
You.

394
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:54,242
I'm not here to squeeze you. You wanna
rip off the cartel, that's your business.

395
00:33:54,409 --> 00:33:59,956
But here's the thing,
I'm picking up that driver. Hector's orders.

396
00:34:00,123 --> 00:34:05,169
We're gonna see what he knows. And if
he knows you, that's bad for both of us.

397
00:34:05,336 --> 00:34:08,089
- That shouldn't concern you.
- But he was in on it, right?

398
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:10,425
- Driver had nothing to do with it.
- Then who?

399
00:34:10,591 --> 00:34:11,843
Just me.

400
00:34:12,009 --> 00:34:15,471
You telling me you did this
without someone on the inside?

401
00:34:15,638 --> 00:34:19,350
Not possible.
How did you know about the truck?

402
00:34:19,517 --> 00:34:21,060
How did you know about the tyres?

403
00:34:21,227 --> 00:34:24,605
All I can tell you is you guys aren't
half as smart as you think you are.

404
00:34:25,773 --> 00:34:30,778
- So the driver doesn't know anything.
- Not a thing.

405
00:34:30,945 --> 00:34:32,238
- He hear your voice?
- No.

406
00:34:32,405 --> 00:34:33,740
Right now,
Hector is looking at the competition...

407
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:35,992
...but he hears the driver say
it was some old gringo....

408
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,829
He didn't hear me.
Saw a guy with a ski mask, that's it.

409
00:34:39,996 --> 00:34:42,832
- And you're sure of that?
- Yeah.

410
00:34:45,168 --> 00:34:46,753
You better be right.

411
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:49,338
Why wasn't it in the papers?

412
00:34:49,505 --> 00:34:50,882
What?

413
00:34:51,299 --> 00:34:55,052
The truck robbery.
The cops keeping it out of the papers?

414
00:34:55,386 --> 00:34:56,929
The cops?

415
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:02,351
- The cops don't know shit about it.
- How's that?

416
00:35:03,394 --> 00:35:06,230
Is that what this is about?

417
00:35:06,397 --> 00:35:09,942
You wanted to put the cops
onto Hector? Why?

418
00:35:10,401 --> 00:35:13,571
You are nothing to him.
He forgot all about you.

419
00:35:14,322 --> 00:35:16,157
I haven't forgotten him.

420
00:35:16,324 --> 00:35:18,659
You put me in the shit...

421
00:35:18,826 --> 00:35:22,121
...just because you got it in
for Hector Salamanca?

422
00:35:23,122 --> 00:35:26,626
Listen, you put the cops on him,
you put them on me.

423
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:29,253
Doing it for the money, I get it.

424
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:32,340
But this shit, that's insane.

425
00:35:32,507 --> 00:35:34,842
You need to calm yourself down.

426
00:35:35,218 --> 00:35:38,971
And you need to take that hand
out of that pocket.

427
00:35:55,696 --> 00:35:58,574
And just so you know, it's over.

428
00:35:58,741 --> 00:36:00,576
I'm done with your boss.

429
00:36:02,578 --> 00:36:04,205
Whatever.

430
00:36:05,873 --> 00:36:08,751
Why wasn't it in the papers?

431
00:36:09,335 --> 00:36:11,921
Because we cleaned it up.

432
00:36:12,296 --> 00:36:15,550
- How's that?
- We got lucky.

433
00:36:15,716 --> 00:36:18,177
After you left,
a Good Samaritan came along and said:

434
00:36:18,344 --> 00:36:21,013
"Oh, my God. Oh, my God."

435
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:26,143
He cut the driver lose. The driver
called us, we came out, got the truck.

436
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:28,312
Made it like it never happened.

437
00:36:32,191 --> 00:36:34,360
And that Good Samaritan?

438
00:36:35,903 --> 00:36:38,281
Hector shot him in the face.

439
00:36:39,949 --> 00:36:42,034
We buried the guy out in the desert.

440
00:36:42,201 --> 00:36:44,078
Like I said...

441
00:36:44,787 --> 00:36:46,747
...we cleaned it up.

442
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:32,251
How was your day?

443
00:37:32,418 --> 00:37:34,629
You know, met with Paige and Kevin.

444
00:37:34,795 --> 00:37:37,632
Interviewed some paralegals.

445
00:37:38,799 --> 00:37:42,511
And this. What about you?

446
00:37:43,596 --> 00:37:45,556
Finished the commercial.

447
00:37:46,557 --> 00:37:50,478
I don't wanna oversell it, but I think
it might be the greatest 60 seconds...

448
00:37:50,645 --> 00:37:52,688
...in the history of television.

449
00:37:54,899 --> 00:38:00,237
Tomorrow morning,
somewhere between 11:18 and 11:35...

450
00:38:00,404 --> 00:38:05,576
...stop what you're doing
and tune in to <i>Diagnosis Murder.</i>

451
00:38:05,743 --> 00:38:08,245
I'll make a point of it.

452
00:38:17,046 --> 00:38:19,048
You wanna talk about this?

453
00:38:20,883 --> 00:38:23,844
Not now, not ever.

454
00:38:28,557 --> 00:38:30,393
I'm just gonna say...

455
00:38:32,728 --> 00:38:37,566
...you are meant for Mesa Verde
and they are meant for you.

456
00:38:37,733 --> 00:38:41,362
So all is right with the world.

457
00:38:50,746 --> 00:38:52,498
Good night.

458
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:56,210
Good night.

459
00:39:09,598 --> 00:39:12,685
Your brother is one smart lawyer.

460
00:39:13,477 --> 00:39:15,187
The smartest one I know.

461
00:39:15,354 --> 00:39:17,857
I mean, no offence.

462
00:39:20,484 --> 00:39:22,862
He'd make quite an adversary.

463
00:39:23,029 --> 00:39:25,156
You better believe it.

464
00:39:28,242 --> 00:39:32,955
The kind of adversary who'd find
even the smallest crack in your defence.

465
00:39:38,711 --> 00:39:40,796
Going against him...

466
00:39:40,963 --> 00:39:44,675
...you'd really wanna make sure
you've got all your I's dotted...

467
00:39:44,842 --> 00:39:47,470
...and your T's crossed.

468
00:39:52,558 --> 00:39:55,603
Nothing for him to find.

469
00:41:17,768 --> 00:41:19,603
Hey, how you doing?

470
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:21,647
Be with you in a minute.

471
00:41:28,445 --> 00:41:30,322
Remember me?

472
00:41:35,661 --> 00:41:37,204
Uh....

473
00:41:38,289 --> 00:41:39,790
No.

474
00:41:40,082 --> 00:41:42,501
I got a weird feeling you do, Lance.

475
00:41:45,588 --> 00:41:48,007
Tonight is a funny night.

476
00:41:48,382 --> 00:41:50,801
For some reason tonight...

477
00:41:51,135 --> 00:41:54,638
...I feel like I've got all the answers.

478
00:41:55,681 --> 00:41:57,766
I'm feeling kind of like, uh....

479
00:41:58,642 --> 00:42:00,311
Like Carnac.

480
00:42:00,477 --> 00:42:02,855
You remember when Johnny Carson
used to do Carnac?

481
00:42:03,022 --> 00:42:05,024
He'd give the answers
before the questions.

482
00:42:05,191 --> 00:42:08,152
You know,
Ed would give him the envelope, yeah?

483
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:13,407
And Johnny would hold it up to
his forehead, and he'd give the answer...

484
00:42:14,408 --> 00:42:15,868
...like <i>Leave it to Beaver.</i>

485
00:42:16,076 --> 00:42:17,953
Then Johnny
would tear open the envelope...

486
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,538
...and there's the question:

487
00:42:19,705 --> 00:42:22,625
"What did the dead raccoon
say in his will?"

488
00:42:23,417 --> 00:42:24,919
That ring a bell?

489
00:42:26,545 --> 00:42:30,549
Before your time?
All right, well, let's cut to the chase.

490
00:42:30,758 --> 00:42:34,011
Um, that guy who just walked out of here,
his name is Ernie.

491
00:42:34,178 --> 00:42:38,182
I'm guessing he showed you my picture
and asked if I was in here the other night.

492
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:41,393
Now he's going to bring his boss,
who's my brother...

493
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:45,272
...and he'll ask you the same question,
"Did you see that guy the other night?"

494
00:42:45,439 --> 00:42:48,525
Well, the answer is no.

495
00:42:48,692 --> 00:42:50,653
You feel me?

496
00:42:52,738 --> 00:42:56,033
- You murder someone?
- No.

497
00:42:57,826 --> 00:43:00,162
- Rob a bank?
- No way am I that cool.

498
00:43:00,329 --> 00:43:04,208
Well, I-- Sometimes I go number two
and I don't flush, but....

499
00:43:04,375 --> 00:43:08,087
No, this is just a thing
between brothers.

500
00:43:08,254 --> 00:43:10,297
And we're both lawyers, so....

501
00:43:10,506 --> 00:43:13,717
Right? I mean,
that's a long and boring story.

502
00:43:13,884 --> 00:43:15,803
You don't wanna know.

503
00:43:19,098 --> 00:43:22,309
Is this gonna get me jammed up
with the cops?

504
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:27,523
My brother might make it sound like that,
but no.

505
00:43:27,898 --> 00:43:29,483
It's just family.

506
00:43:34,822 --> 00:43:36,824
Then I feel you.

507
00:43:40,035 --> 00:43:42,496
- Hey, tell me about the cameras.
- Oh, uh....

508
00:43:42,663 --> 00:43:45,374
They go to a VCR in the back.

509
00:43:45,541 --> 00:43:49,503
It tapes for 12 hours
and then records over itself.

510
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:51,755
So I'm on there now.

511
00:43:53,007 --> 00:43:55,384
How hard would it be to erase?

512
00:43:55,884 --> 00:43:58,929
Hmm. I don't know.

513
00:43:59,096 --> 00:44:00,973
Could be tricky.

514
00:44:01,265 --> 00:44:03,267
And expensive.

515
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,936
Like a hundred bucks expensive?

516
00:44:06,103 --> 00:44:08,105
Like two hundred bucks expensive.

517
00:44:10,024 --> 00:44:13,068
You will go far, my young friend.

518
00:44:50,105 --> 00:44:52,024
Good evening.

519
00:44:52,191 --> 00:44:55,611
- Uh, "Lance," is it?
- Yeah.

520
00:44:55,778 --> 00:44:57,279
Lance, I'm Charles McGill.

521
00:44:57,446 --> 00:45:02,785
My associate spoke with you earlier
and he showed you this photo.

522
00:45:02,951 --> 00:45:04,495
Um....

523
00:45:04,787 --> 00:45:07,539
On or about the morning of the 18th...

524
00:45:07,706 --> 00:45:10,250
...this person was here in this shop,
is that correct?

525
00:45:10,417 --> 00:45:15,047
- Uh, on or about the....
- The 18th, early morning, yeah.

526
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:19,593
No.

527
00:45:20,803 --> 00:45:26,141
Well, I believe you told my associate
that he was here and he made copies.

528
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:31,939
Yeah, but sorry, no.

529
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:37,403
Yeah, that's my guy.

530
00:45:38,695 --> 00:45:40,656
All right, the, uh....

531
00:45:41,198 --> 00:45:43,534
The night of Tuesday the 17th...

532
00:45:43,742 --> 00:45:49,248
...leading into early Wednesday,
the early hours of Wednesday the 18th.

533
00:45:49,915 --> 00:45:53,460
Were you, in fact, here?
Can we establish that?

534
00:45:53,627 --> 00:45:56,547
I mean, I work graveyard...

535
00:45:57,256 --> 00:45:58,882
...so, yeah.

536
00:45:59,925 --> 00:46:01,885
Stay strong, Lance.

537
00:46:02,052 --> 00:46:05,305
Was this man here making copies?

538
00:46:07,433 --> 00:46:10,853
Yeah. It's like I said, I don't think so.

539
00:46:11,019 --> 00:46:15,315
Earlier you said that he was here. Now
you're saying that he wasn't. Which is it?

540
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:19,695
Yeah, well, when that guy showed me
the picture, I thought maybe.

541
00:46:19,862 --> 00:46:22,865
But now that I'm seeing it again, uh....

542
00:46:24,158 --> 00:46:27,786
Sorry, don't know what to tell you.
Guess I was wrong.

543
00:46:27,995 --> 00:46:34,042
Son, listen carefully. I am an officer
of the court investigating a felony.

544
00:46:34,209 --> 00:46:37,379
- So you're a cop?
- No. No, I'm not. I'm--

545
00:46:37,546 --> 00:46:40,591
Mr. McGill,
maybe we better get you home.

546
00:46:40,757 --> 00:46:44,803
Ernesto, do not speak to me
as if I were a child. I'm fine.

547
00:46:54,271 --> 00:46:56,773
I am not a police officer.
I am an attorney.

548
00:46:57,065 --> 00:47:01,528
And I have a moral and legal obligation
to get to the bottom of this matter.

549
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:07,034
- The bottom of what?
- Forgery, fraud, falsifying evidence.

550
00:47:10,537 --> 00:47:13,457
- Breaking and entering.
- This guy, is he okay?

551
00:47:13,624 --> 00:47:16,919
- There's nothing wrong with me.
- Maybe we could just take a break.

552
00:47:17,085 --> 00:47:18,795
Ernie, shut up!

553
00:47:20,881 --> 00:47:22,716
You think about
the choice you're making.

554
00:47:22,883 --> 00:47:26,303
I already told you he wasn't here.
What do you want me to say?

555
00:47:27,179 --> 00:47:30,557
I want you to speak the truth.
I know he was here.

556
00:47:30,724 --> 00:47:34,394
I know what he did.
Tell me what you told Ernesto.

557
00:47:34,561 --> 00:47:36,647
- Stop trying to change your story.
- Excuse me.

558
00:47:36,813 --> 00:47:39,358
Sorry. How do we get this
to do 11-by-14?

559
00:47:39,525 --> 00:47:40,776
No, excuse me.

560
00:47:40,943 --> 00:47:44,154
- We are having a conversation here!
- You gotta switch it to Tray 4.

561
00:47:44,321 --> 00:47:46,657
It's easier if I tell you. Look....

562
00:47:50,494 --> 00:47:56,041
Dude, okay,
I don't want any problems here, so just....

563
00:47:57,251 --> 00:48:00,045
Get him out of here
or I'm gonna call the cops, okay?

564
00:48:00,212 --> 00:48:04,800
- Don't walk away. We are not finished.
- I am done talking to you, man.

565
00:48:26,905 --> 00:48:28,907
Call 911.

566
00:48:29,866 --> 00:48:32,786
Call 911. Come on.
