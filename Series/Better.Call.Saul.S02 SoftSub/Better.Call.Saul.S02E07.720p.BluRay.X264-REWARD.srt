Jimmy?

How's that sweeping going?

9
00:00:34,202 --> 00:00:36,329
Going good, Pop.

10
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:39,916
Hi, how are you?

11
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:43,336
Hello, sir. I was wondering if
maybe you could help me.

12
00:00:43,503 --> 00:00:44,963
Yeah?

13
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,549
Well, I drove into the city this morning.

14
00:00:47,716 --> 00:00:50,635
Usually I take the train,
but I was just in such a rush...

15
00:00:50,802 --> 00:00:53,221
...to get some medicine
for my son, Freddie.

16
00:00:53,388 --> 00:00:57,100
He has epilepsy.
He had an attack this morning.

17
00:00:57,267 --> 00:01:01,271
But during his fit, he knocked the bottle
of medicine out of my wife's hand.

18
00:01:01,438 --> 00:01:04,607
And just, bam, one huge puddle.

19
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:06,151
Oh, that's terrible.

20
00:01:06,317 --> 00:01:09,112
Well, long story short, drove into town.

21
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,490
I bought the new medicine with
every last nickel in my pocket.

22
00:01:12,657 --> 00:01:14,743
And then my car died.

23
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,495
- Oh, God. That's-- That's just--
- I know.

24
00:01:17,704 --> 00:01:19,706
When it rains, it pours, right? Heh.

25
00:01:19,873 --> 00:01:21,583
I tried the ignition.

26
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,669
Just nothing, not firing.

27
00:01:25,378 --> 00:01:29,132
Anyway,
now I've convinced myself that...

28
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:33,136
...Freddie's gonna have another seizure
before I get back with the medicine.

29
00:01:33,303 --> 00:01:38,057
So if you can help me,
I would be so grateful.

30
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:41,186
Well, I could come out
and check your car for you.

31
00:01:41,352 --> 00:01:44,814
Maybe it's just a spark plug. I got
a box of plugs back in the stockroom.

32
00:01:45,023 --> 00:01:47,192
Thanks, and I appreciate that.

33
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:50,570
But if you could possibly
just spare $5 instead?

34
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:54,657
I'd rather grab a cab than
take a chance with my old clunker.

35
00:01:55,116 --> 00:01:56,826
Yeah, $5.

36
00:01:56,993 --> 00:01:59,162
If you can spare it.

37
00:02:04,876 --> 00:02:06,586
- Yeah, okay, sure.
- Psst.

38
00:02:07,629 --> 00:02:09,798
Dad, come here.

39
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:12,008
Come here.

40
00:02:15,762 --> 00:02:19,682
Dad, it's a rip-off,
just like that bum from last week.

41
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:20,892
Jimmy--

42
00:02:21,059 --> 00:02:25,104
Every grifter in town knows that this
is the spot to come for an easy handout.

43
00:02:25,313 --> 00:02:27,565
"Grifter"?
Where did you learn that word?

44
00:02:27,774 --> 00:02:31,027
Dad, his story's baloney.
He probably doesn't even have a son.

45
00:02:31,402 --> 00:02:33,363
He's conning you.

46
00:02:34,447 --> 00:02:37,826
Jimmy, what if you're wrong?

47
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:39,452
You know what?

48
00:02:41,204 --> 00:02:44,499
I'm sorry to bother you folks.
I'm gonna get out of here. I'm gonna--

49
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,376
- No, no, no.
- Dad--

50
00:02:46,543 --> 00:02:48,711
No, no bother. Come on, now. Here.

51
00:02:52,882 --> 00:02:54,592
Here's $10 for you.

52
00:02:55,218 --> 00:02:57,762
Sir, you're--

53
00:02:58,721 --> 00:03:01,307
That's-- That is so generous.

54
00:03:01,474 --> 00:03:03,768
You know what?
I'm gonna go back in the stockroom.

55
00:03:03,935 --> 00:03:06,521
Find those spark plugs.
We'll get your car started.

56
00:03:06,688 --> 00:03:08,982
Come on, Jimmy.
Just man the till, okay?

57
00:03:09,148 --> 00:03:12,110
And I'll just be back in a jiff, okay?

58
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:21,870
How much for a carton of Kools?

59
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:23,913
Four bucks.

60
00:03:24,247 --> 00:03:25,707
Yeah, give me a carton.

61
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:28,501
Money first.

90
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:55,023
Hey, come on. Let's get this over with.

91
00:05:56,649 --> 00:05:58,234
Thank you for seeing us.

92
00:05:58,401 --> 00:06:01,946
We don't wanna take up too much
of your time, so I'll get right to it.

93
00:06:02,113 --> 00:06:06,409
Um, I regret to inform you that
with the benefit of hindsight...

94
00:06:06,576 --> 00:06:10,163
...Mr. Ehrmantraut will be amending
his original statement a tad.

95
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:12,290
- "A tad"?
- A wee bit.

96
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:16,377
He's decided that he can no longer
in good conscience...

97
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:19,839
...claim that the gun found at the scene
belonged to Tuco Salamanca.

98
00:06:20,048 --> 00:06:21,883
- So whose gun was it?
- Who's to say?

99
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:24,260
You know how many guns
there are in Albuquerque?

100
00:06:24,427 --> 00:06:28,931
Somewhere between the number of
rattlesnakes and grains of sand, so a lot.

101
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:32,351
- Was it your gun, Mr. Ehrmantraut?
- No, he's not saying that.

102
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:35,021
Can we hear it from Mr. Ehrmantraut?

103
00:06:35,188 --> 00:06:38,107
The gun wasn't Salamanca's.
That's all I can tell you.

104
00:06:38,274 --> 00:06:42,195
You told us it was. You said
Salamanca pulled it and pointed it at you.

105
00:06:42,904 --> 00:06:43,905
Well, he didn't.

106
00:06:44,072 --> 00:06:46,741
- Why are you changing your story?
- Good citizenship.

107
00:06:47,116 --> 00:06:50,328
Look, there was only one set of prints
on the gun. Salamanca's.

108
00:06:50,495 --> 00:06:52,455
How's that gonna happen
if it wasn't his?

109
00:06:52,622 --> 00:06:55,208
That's not really for
my client to say, now, is it?

110
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:57,710
He's not a forensics expert.

111
00:06:57,877 --> 00:07:03,341
Who knows? Maybe it, uh,
fell from a passing bird's beak.

112
00:07:03,508 --> 00:07:07,637
Mr. Salamanca caught it, tried to throw
it away. The possibilities are endless.

113
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:09,722
- Did Salamanca threaten you?
- Hey.

114
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:14,685
We wanna put this guy away for years.
The gun makes all the difference.

115
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:16,938
You gonna let this person
victimize you twice?

116
00:07:17,105 --> 00:07:18,898
Forget about the gun, all right?

117
00:07:19,065 --> 00:07:20,817
The gun was not Salamanca's.

118
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:25,571
If you introduce it, Mr. Ehrmantraut will
make himself available to the defence.

119
00:07:25,738 --> 00:07:30,326
And he will set the record straight,
categorically and unequivocally.

120
00:07:32,745 --> 00:07:34,747
Did he threaten you or pay you off?

121
00:07:34,956 --> 00:07:37,834
Whoa, okay, that's it. We're done.

122
00:07:58,187 --> 00:08:00,064
You're doing the right thing.

123
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:03,401
This Salamanca character? Maniac.

124
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:04,986
I had my own...

125
00:08:07,572 --> 00:08:09,282
...thing with him.

126
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:12,451
I didn't wanna say before
because conflict of interest...

127
00:08:12,618 --> 00:08:15,746
...yadda yadda, but yeah, he's nuts.

128
00:08:17,415 --> 00:08:20,376
I'm talking
he had me hog-tied in the desert...

129
00:08:20,543 --> 00:08:22,503
...with a gun to my head.

130
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,214
Broke two guys' legs
right in front of me.

131
00:08:25,381 --> 00:08:28,509
If I hadn't
talked him down, he probably would've--

132
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:32,638
I'll spare you the gory details,
but it was a deal and a half.

133
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:34,807
Not something you forget.

134
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,020
And you're telling me this why?

135
00:08:39,187 --> 00:08:41,606
Don't be too tough on yourself.

136
00:08:41,814 --> 00:08:44,567
Like they say,
discretion is the better part of valour.

137
00:08:44,734 --> 00:08:46,777
I would've done the same thing.

138
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:50,531
Hey, today, it's on me. No charge.

139
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,285
You take the next one.

140
00:08:55,703 --> 00:08:57,538
And bill me.

141
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,710
Ingrate.

142
00:09:06,172 --> 00:09:08,299
<i>- Hey, Jimmy.</i>
- Did you tell Howard yet?

143
00:09:08,466 --> 00:09:11,260
<i>- I can't really talk right now.</i>
- You didn't tell him.

144
00:09:12,136 --> 00:09:16,390
No, and I won't until it's rock solid.
Like, offer-letter-in-hand solid.

145
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:18,267
<i>When you gonna get that offer letter?</i>

146
00:09:18,434 --> 00:09:21,520
I'm guessing next Thursday
after my interview with the partners.

147
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:24,482
- Yeah, but that's just a formality, right?
<i>- Basically.</i>

148
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,360
- I hope.
<i>- What's the offer, you think?</i>

149
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:29,237
I mean, brass tacks.

150
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:32,240
<i>Well, it's not gonna be as
plush as your deal at Davis & Main.</i>

151
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:34,242
<i>But they'll make me
partner in two years.</i>

152
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:36,577
<i>As opposed to between
five years and never at HHM.</i>

153
00:09:36,744 --> 00:09:38,162
Not too shabby.

154
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:41,707
<i>- Then there's my law school loans.</i>
- What is that? A couple grand by now?

155
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:44,835
I wish. I had to finance the thing
only making mail room money.

156
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:47,088
I've got, like, 15,000 left.

157
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:50,424
Wow, Schweikart wants you bad, huh?

158
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,510
<i>Jimmy, did you have something
you needed?</i>

159
00:09:52,677 --> 00:09:55,846
No, no, just checking in.
I'll see you later, okay?

160
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:58,933
<i>If you play your cards right. Bye, heh.</i>

161
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:09,026
Omar, where are you?

162
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:13,531
Omar, would you be so kind
as to take a letter for me?

163
00:10:13,698 --> 00:10:15,950
"Dearest Clifford."

164
00:10:16,117 --> 00:10:18,411
No, that's too much.

165
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:21,956
"Dear Cliff."
What do you think? "Clifford" or "Cliff"?

166
00:10:22,415 --> 00:10:24,709
I don't, uh--
Depends on what the letter is.

167
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:26,919
That's fine. Treat yourself.

168
00:10:27,086 --> 00:10:29,130
"Dear" whoever you put in.

169
00:10:29,297 --> 00:10:31,507
Continuing. Uh....

170
00:10:31,674 --> 00:10:33,801
"My heart is heavy as--"

171
00:10:33,968 --> 00:10:36,762
No, that sounds like
a medical condition.

172
00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:41,017
Let's go with, "It is with a heavy heart."

173
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:42,184
Okay?

174
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:48,316
"It is with a heavy heart that I tender
my resignation to Davis & Main."

175
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:50,735
"Tender" is better than "submit,"
yeah?

176
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:53,446
- "Resignation"?
- Yes, sir.

177
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:57,158
So "tender." Blah, blah, blah.
"To Davis & Main.

178
00:10:57,325 --> 00:11:00,828
These have been some of the most...

179
00:11:00,995 --> 00:11:04,790
...professionally
satisfying days of my life."

180
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,212
What's wrong?
You think I'm laying it on too thick?

181
00:11:10,421 --> 00:11:12,590
No. Um....

182
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:16,344
I just didn't realise
how unhappy you were here.

183
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:18,596
Not unhappy, per se.

184
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:22,141
More like "not happy."

185
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,977
I had no idea.

186
00:11:25,144 --> 00:11:27,355
It's not your fault, buddy.

187
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:29,774
You're top-notch.

188
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,108
Where were we?

189
00:11:31,317 --> 00:11:34,236
You worked so hard to get here.

190
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:37,948
It's so much to give up.
I mean, the perks alone--

191
00:11:38,157 --> 00:11:40,701
Yeah. The apartment is, uh....

192
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:43,704
Yeah. Heh. And the car.

193
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:46,499
For the most part,
the car is pretty sweet.

194
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:48,834
- And the bonus?
- Well...

195
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:52,505
...the bonus is a done deal. They cut me
the cheque. I get to keep the bonus.

196
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:55,049
Not if you quit.

197
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:59,178
Before a certain term--
I think yours is a year.

198
00:11:59,345 --> 00:12:01,639
--you have to pay the money back.

199
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:05,267
Uh....

200
00:12:09,522 --> 00:12:11,399
It's, um--

201
00:12:12,942 --> 00:12:16,320
Yeah. Uh-- Um....

202
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,532
Yeah, yeah. It's, uh--
I think it's right here. Uh--

203
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:21,617
Yeah.

204
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:31,627
Omar...

205
00:12:31,794 --> 00:12:37,716
...that whole, uh, letter of resignation
thing, that--

206
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:39,635
I didn't mean that.

207
00:12:39,802 --> 00:12:41,637
Not a word. I--

208
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:48,644
I am so incredibly stressed out.

209
00:12:48,811 --> 00:12:52,231
I'm stressed out the wazoo.

210
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:57,278
To be honest,
it has been more of an adjustment...

211
00:12:57,445 --> 00:13:01,240
...than I expected
here at Davis & Main. So I just--

212
00:13:01,407 --> 00:13:04,702
Don't repeat what I said to anyone.

213
00:13:04,869 --> 00:13:08,789
I figured something had to be wrong,
really wrong.

214
00:13:08,998 --> 00:13:11,584
Because you like it here, right?

215
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:13,377
I love it.

216
00:13:13,544 --> 00:13:16,964
Call it a momentary lapse of reason.

217
00:13:17,131 --> 00:13:23,304
But just-- Let's just rewind the tape
and, you know, forget this happened.

218
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:27,349
Mum's the word. No problem.

219
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:29,393
Yeah, I feel better already.

220
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,104
Sometimes you have to
say something out loud...

221
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:34,732
...to hear how crazy it sounds.

222
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:37,943
Thank you, Omar.

223
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:39,982
Hi. Jimmy McGill.

224
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:43,277
Jimmy, this is Al Newman
of Allied Funeral Homes.

225
00:15:43,444 --> 00:15:45,696
- Great to meet you, Al.
- Nice tie.

226
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:47,072
Thanks.

227
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:50,326
All right. Let's get started, shall we?

228
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:16,352
- What are you doing?
- Hey, Doug. Got a juicer for the office.

229
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:18,604
- Jimmy, it's very loud.
- Brian, come on in.

230
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:22,858
- We have clients out there.
- Sure you can. Two coming right up.

231
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,278
Sometimes it gets a little jammed.
You just gotta force it.

232
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,406
- Aah.
- Oh. Oh, shit.

233
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:32,826
Oh. I'm spreading it around.

234
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:35,079
Did I get you?
And now I got you with this.

235
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:36,997
For chrissakes, Jimmy.

236
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,013
Backwards only.

237
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:58,644
Yeah? Because it's got suction that way.
Leverage and physics.

238
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:03,607
Don Clifford wants his floors clean.

239
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:08,570
Dude, I'm from Michigan.

240
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:11,365
So you don't understand
a word I've been saying?

241
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:15,369
Good night. No, you try. Backwards.

242
00:17:27,131 --> 00:17:30,300
Excuse me.
Can I have everyone's attention, please?

243
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:32,219
Everyone can hear me? Good.

244
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:35,931
This is not a conversation
I ever thought I would have in my career.

245
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,016
But it's been brought to my attention...

246
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:40,936
...that we have an ongoing situation
in the washroom.

247
00:17:41,145 --> 00:17:42,354
Someone is not flushing.

248
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:46,358
Once is an accident, maybe even twice.
Three times? That's a pattern.

249
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:49,403
- We're not talking about a number one.
- Yes. Thank you, Erin.

250
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:53,949
Now, I'm not here to shame anyone nor
do I even wanna know who did it. But--

251
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:55,951
Uh, Cliff, it was me.

252
00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:00,164
- Jimmy, I just said I didn't wanna know.
- Hey, we need the water.

253
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:03,292
Now, I read somewhere
that the Santa Fe watershed...

254
00:18:03,459 --> 00:18:05,961
...is down two full inches this year.

255
00:18:06,128 --> 00:18:10,257
Every time you flush a toilet,
you waste a gallon of water.

256
00:18:10,466 --> 00:18:12,885
A gallon.
What could be greener than this?

257
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:16,138
They're low-flow toilets, Jimmy.
From now on, flush.

258
00:18:16,555 --> 00:18:20,392
Low-flow. That's good. Good thinking.

259
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:57,054
What is that?

260
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:59,348
I'm gonna call you back.

261
00:19:09,817 --> 00:19:12,069
Jimmy, what's going on in there?

262
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:14,822
Jimmy.

263
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:18,909
Oh, you can hear this through the door?
I didn't realise. I'm sorry.

264
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:23,247
- What do you think you're doing?
- I took your advice. I'm blowing off steam.

265
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:25,207
"Blowing off steam"?

266
00:19:25,374 --> 00:19:28,627
Yeah, yeah.
Like you and your guitar, you know?

267
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:32,464
I gotta say, you're right.
I mean, it really helps with stress.

268
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:35,175
I know I don't sound very good,
but I'm just learning.

269
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:38,095
I heard that the key is you have to
keep this bag inflated.

270
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:40,681
Enough. Put that down now.

271
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:42,975
I want you in my office.

272
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:54,111
You win.

273
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:56,738
- What do I win?
- You're fired.

274
00:19:56,947 --> 00:19:59,032
What?
Cliff, if this is about the bagpipes--

275
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:01,410
It's not about the bagpipes.

276
00:20:02,077 --> 00:20:05,205
Of course it's the bagpipes.
It's the bagpipes, the not flushing...

277
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:09,376
...and this optical migraine
you call a business suit. It's about--

278
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:14,256
It's about you keeping your bonus,
that's what this is about.

279
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:17,050
Been brushing up on
your contract law, haven't you?

280
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:21,138
You want out of here. But you can't up
and quit and expect to keep your bonus.

281
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:25,183
If I fire you for cause, like I should have
done for the TV commercial, no bonus.

282
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:30,147
However, if I fire you not for cause,
but for being an all-around jackass...

283
00:20:30,314 --> 00:20:32,316
...yeah, hooray for you.

284
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:35,736
- If you think there's been malfeasance--
- Oh, save it.

285
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:38,697
I could fight you on this,
but you're not worth my time.

286
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:41,199
I'd rather just have you gone.

287
00:20:43,744 --> 00:20:45,537
I'm sorry you feel that way.

288
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:49,374
I'll just, uh, pack up.

289
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:54,046
First, do me the favour of not
treating me like a fool for once.

290
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:56,757
Tell me,
how exactly did I mistreat you?

291
00:20:56,965 --> 00:20:58,884
What did I do to
deserve this behaviour?

292
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:02,387
We gave you opportunities, encouraged
you, got you a car, an apartment.

293
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:05,974
Hell, that cocobolo desk.
Do you see a desk like that in here?

294
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:09,144
You never gave this a chance. Why?

295
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:12,606
I tried to make it work.

296
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,525
Really. I did. I'm just...

297
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:17,277
...a square peg.

298
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:19,947
If you knew that,
why did you take the job?

299
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:25,619
I'm sorry.

300
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:32,042
- How much was the desk?
- Seven thousand dollars.

301
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:35,879
I'll write you a cheque.

302
00:21:36,505 --> 00:21:40,842
Fine, for whatever good that does.
Take your desk and get out.

303
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:46,723
Hey, Cliff, for what it's worth,
I think you're a good guy.

304
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:50,978
For what it's worth,
I think you're an asshole.

305
00:22:10,414 --> 00:22:11,748
Hey!

306
00:22:39,276 --> 00:22:40,318
Uh, yeah, it's open.

307
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:45,240
- Jimmy.
- Hey, can I talk to you for a minute?

308
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:49,327
- Does Howard know you're here?
- God, no. I snuck in.

309
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:51,997
Well, yeah, but make it quick.

310
00:22:52,164 --> 00:22:54,332
Actually, can we talk
in the conference room?

311
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:57,836
- Why?
- It's just more appropriate.

312
00:22:58,045 --> 00:23:00,505
No one's gonna need it until 4.
I checked.

313
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:04,259
Please? Ten minutes tops.

314
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,220
After you.

315
00:23:08,597 --> 00:23:10,015
Have a seat.

316
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:13,101
What--? What is going on? Spill it.

317
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:16,730
Okay.

318
00:23:17,272 --> 00:23:19,566
Schweikart & Cokely will pay
your debt to HHM...

319
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:22,027
...and make you a partner in two years,
correct?

320
00:23:22,194 --> 00:23:23,361
Apparently.

321
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:26,740
That's the deal, yes. Why?

322
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:28,992
Would you entertain a better offer?

323
00:23:29,701 --> 00:23:31,495
From who? HHM?

324
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:33,789
From me.

325
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,625
I'll make you partner tomorrow.

326
00:23:37,793 --> 00:23:40,629
Consider that proof of concept.

327
00:23:40,962 --> 00:23:44,257
Wexler-McGill, partners at law.

328
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:46,718
You and me. Together.

329
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:50,180
If Schweikart can pay your debt,
so can I.

330
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:53,683
And with my signing bonus,
you'll have a clean slate.

331
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,018
Sky's the limit.

332
00:23:55,685 --> 00:23:58,146
Hey, we're good together. You know that.

333
00:23:58,313 --> 00:24:01,608
So, what's stopping us?
Let's jump in with both feet.

334
00:24:01,775 --> 00:24:04,694
Be our own bosses.
Build our own future.

335
00:24:06,238 --> 00:24:09,074
Be our own bosses. Heh.

336
00:24:09,241 --> 00:24:10,367
What about clients?

337
00:24:10,534 --> 00:24:12,369
Mesa Verde signed with you,
didn't they?

338
00:24:12,536 --> 00:24:14,329
It would be a hard sell to bring them.

339
00:24:14,496 --> 00:24:16,373
So then, there'll be
another Mesa Verde.

340
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:21,503
That was all you, Kim.
You did it once, you can do it again.

341
00:24:23,922 --> 00:24:26,216
- You make it sound easy.
- No.

342
00:24:26,383 --> 00:24:29,302
You're talking to a guy who lived
in the back of a nail salon.

343
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,807
It'll be a lot of blood, sweat
and tears. At least at the start.

344
00:24:33,974 --> 00:24:37,435
But in the end, we'll have a practice
that is 100 percent ours.

345
00:24:37,602 --> 00:24:39,271
That's worth it.

346
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:41,857
Or we fail and we end up with nothing.

347
00:24:42,023 --> 00:24:44,276
- You're right. It's a gamble.
- It's a big one.

348
00:24:44,442 --> 00:24:46,319
Yeah, but you're betting on yourself.

349
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:50,740
And from where I sit, the odds are in
your favour. You're an amazing lawyer.

350
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:53,869
This is your chance
to show the world that.

351
00:24:57,289 --> 00:24:58,623
So why not go to Schweikart?

352
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:01,418
They'll make me partner,
and they're a solid firm.

353
00:25:01,585 --> 00:25:04,754
- You can't deny that.
- You deserve more than a lateral move.

354
00:25:05,046 --> 00:25:07,215
Bottom line, that's what Schweikart
represents.

355
00:25:07,382 --> 00:25:09,843
He's just Howard Hamlin
by a different name.

356
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:12,470
You keep talking about me.
What about Davis & Main?

357
00:25:13,263 --> 00:25:15,432
It's over. I quit today.

358
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,059
Well, technically I got fired.

359
00:25:19,144 --> 00:25:20,145
What happened?

360
00:25:20,312 --> 00:25:22,939
It was mutual and a long time coming.

361
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:26,860
That job was never the right fit for me.
This is.

362
00:25:31,698 --> 00:25:34,618
If we're gonna be law partners,
I need to know one thing:

363
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,206
What kind of lawyer are you gonna be?

364
00:25:39,998 --> 00:25:43,001
I don't mean what kind of law
are you gonna practise. I mean...

365
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:47,923
...are you gonna play it straight,
or are you gonna...

366
00:25:48,882 --> 00:25:49,966
...be colourful?

367
00:25:50,717 --> 00:25:52,969
I'm gonna play it straight.

368
00:25:53,136 --> 00:25:54,304
Right down the line.

369
00:25:54,512 --> 00:25:58,683
I'm gonna dot every I,
and I'm gonna cross every....

370
00:26:07,192 --> 00:26:10,278
There's no point in me doing this
if I can't be myself.

371
00:26:10,987 --> 00:26:15,116
Every time I try to do things someone
else's way, it blows up in my face.

372
00:26:15,283 --> 00:26:19,120
That's what happened at Davis & Main.
Look how that turned out.

373
00:26:19,329 --> 00:26:23,333
I almost derailed your career.
Pissed everyone off.

374
00:26:24,251 --> 00:26:27,545
I've been trying to be the person
someone else wants me to be for...

375
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,089
...I don't know how long.

376
00:26:29,256 --> 00:26:31,049
At first it was Chuck...

377
00:26:31,216 --> 00:26:33,802
...then it was you,
and that's not your fault.

378
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:37,013
That was my choice,
but if we're gonna do this...

379
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,391
...I gotta go into it as me.

380
00:26:39,557 --> 00:26:41,017
So...

381
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:44,771
...yeah. Colourful, I guess.

382
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,898
What do you say?

383
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,360
I just--

384
00:26:51,736 --> 00:26:54,614
I don't see why it's so important
to you that we work together.

385
00:26:54,781 --> 00:26:56,533
I mean, we're already--

386
00:26:56,741 --> 00:26:58,952
- Why do you need me for this?
- I don't need you.

387
00:26:59,494 --> 00:27:00,954
I want you.

388
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:04,124
You've got me.

389
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:07,585
Just not as a law partner.

390
00:27:17,929 --> 00:27:19,848
I have to get back to work.

391
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:23,518
- You okay?
- Yeah, no.

392
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:25,145
I'm fine.

393
00:27:26,229 --> 00:27:27,689
Go on.

394
00:27:30,358 --> 00:27:33,028
- See you later?
- Yeah.

395
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:43,330
It's move-in ready, as you can see.

396
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:48,335
And they've renovated within the past
three years. New floors and kitchen.

397
00:27:49,044 --> 00:27:52,339
And it's a good amount of space.

398
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,677
- It's not too much house, you think?
- No, not at all.

399
00:27:57,844 --> 00:28:00,180
And look at that backyard.

400
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:03,058
They're leaving the playhouse.
Isn't that amazing?

401
00:28:03,224 --> 00:28:05,727
- Kaylee will go crazy for that.
- Heh-heh-heh.

402
00:28:05,894 --> 00:28:08,563
- You'll never get her out of there.
- I know, right?

403
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:12,442
And most important, the schools
are good and the neighbourhood's great.

404
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:15,612
I called the local precinct
and asked about crime stats.

405
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:19,491
They're some of the lowest in the city.
Plus I got a good vibe from him.

406
00:28:19,657 --> 00:28:22,452
- They sounded really responsive.
- Sounds perfect.

407
00:28:23,036 --> 00:28:24,788
Yeah.

408
00:28:24,996 --> 00:28:26,623
Do you like it?

409
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:29,542
If you're happy, I'm happy.
Do you like it?

410
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:31,086
Yeah, I do.

411
00:28:31,252 --> 00:28:33,463
- But I'm--
- But what?

412
00:28:34,172 --> 00:28:37,675
It's a lot of money. I know,
I'm like a broken record, but it is.

413
00:28:37,842 --> 00:28:40,428
Don't worry. We'll make it happen
whatever the cost.

414
00:28:40,595 --> 00:28:43,848
- Mike....
- Hey, I'm serious. Not another thought.

415
00:28:44,474 --> 00:28:46,184
If you want it, it's yours.

416
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,989
- How are we looking?
- Oh, it's perfect.

417
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:02,242
- Let's do it.
- Fantastic.

418
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:03,618
Do you have another hour?

419
00:29:03,785 --> 00:29:06,413
We could go to the office,
get the pre-approval in order.

420
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:09,916
- Sounds good. We'll meet you there.
- Sure. See you in a few.

421
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:14,295
- Oh. I feel like I can finally breathe.
- Good. I'm glad.

422
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:20,218
- You wanna ride together?
- No, I'll follow you over.

423
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:23,888
The car looks good. Wouldn't know
you so much as scratched it.

424
00:29:24,055 --> 00:29:27,100
Yeah. My guy knows his stuff.

425
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:33,815
Thank you, Pop. For everything.

426
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:46,077
- You go on, now. I'll see you there.
- Okay.

427
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,788
Right here.

428
00:30:41,382 --> 00:30:44,802
- Sorry I almost lost you at that light.
- No problem.

429
00:30:50,517 --> 00:30:52,435
Watch the fish tank.

430
00:30:56,898 --> 00:30:59,526
To the left. My left, my left.

431
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:04,072
There.

432
00:31:05,698 --> 00:31:06,741
What do you think?

433
00:31:08,743 --> 00:31:10,370
Uh, yeah.

434
00:31:10,662 --> 00:31:12,247
It's, um--

435
00:31:13,456 --> 00:31:14,749
Yeah.

436
00:31:24,008 --> 00:31:26,386
What should I do with this?

437
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:30,557
Dump it on the side of the road.
That's where I got it in the first place.

438
00:31:45,113 --> 00:31:46,281
Hey, buddy.

439
00:31:46,447 --> 00:31:48,116
- This is over and above.
- No, really.

440
00:31:48,283 --> 00:31:50,201
How about a drink?
I know I could use one.

441
00:31:50,368 --> 00:31:52,912
- Come on. I'm buying.
- No, I'm good. Long drive.

442
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:56,416
- Cucumber water for the road?
- I'm totally set. Thank you.

443
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:59,460
Gotta get home to my kids.

444
00:32:00,211 --> 00:32:02,589
How about you?
What are you gonna do now?

445
00:32:04,257 --> 00:32:06,092
Onward and upward.

446
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:10,013
Thanks, Omar. Drive safe.

447
00:32:47,342 --> 00:32:50,219
Hello. You've reached the law offices...

448
00:32:50,386 --> 00:32:52,513
...of James M. McGill, esquire.

449
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,849
Kindly leave--

450
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:13,493
Hi. You've reached
the law offices of Jimmy McGill.

451
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:18,539
Please leave a message and I'll get back
to you as soon as I can. Thanks.

452
00:34:24,188 --> 00:34:27,066
Summary judgements?
Yes, I've handled six.

453
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:30,194
Actually, one recently
was quite complex.

454
00:34:30,361 --> 00:34:33,906
It was a litigation.
The result of a nasty divorce.

455
00:34:34,073 --> 00:34:38,286
My client sued her former company, which
she and her ex split in their settlement.

456
00:34:38,453 --> 00:34:41,622
The issues involved had me chasing
case law for weeks.

457
00:34:41,956 --> 00:34:44,125
- Who heard it?
- Judge Pittman.

458
00:34:44,292 --> 00:34:45,418
Oh. Heh, heh.

459
00:34:45,585 --> 00:34:49,380
- That guy, he's a handful, huh?
- Well, he can be a tough nut to crack.

460
00:34:49,547 --> 00:34:51,966
- But he did rule in my favour.
- Mm-hm.

461
00:34:52,175 --> 00:34:54,552
All right, enough about law, law, law.

462
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,138
We know you're good,
we know you know your stuff.

463
00:34:57,305 --> 00:34:59,015
Tell us about Kim Wexler.

464
00:34:59,766 --> 00:35:02,351
- You started in the mailroom, right?
- I did.

465
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,646
I was there almost, well,
10 years ago now.

466
00:35:05,813 --> 00:35:08,274
Pulled yourself up by your boot straps.
I like that.

467
00:35:08,441 --> 00:35:10,818
I see you went to UNM Law.
Are you from New Mexico?

468
00:35:11,027 --> 00:35:12,361
Not originally.

469
00:35:13,404 --> 00:35:16,491
I'm from the Midwest. Just a tiny little
town barely on the map.

470
00:35:16,657 --> 00:35:18,284
Near the Kansas/Nebraska border.

471
00:35:18,993 --> 00:35:20,620
You've never heard of it.

472
00:35:21,287 --> 00:35:22,789
So, what brought you here?

473
00:35:23,664 --> 00:35:25,291
I guess...

474
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:30,004
...one day I just looked around at my life,
at who I was...

475
00:35:30,171 --> 00:35:32,340
...and realised if I kept going
the way I was--

476
00:35:32,548 --> 00:35:34,091
Which way was that?

477
00:35:35,009 --> 00:35:38,763
Best case, probably married to the guy
that ran the town gas station.

478
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:41,349
Maybe cashiering
down at the Hinky Dinky.

479
00:35:41,557 --> 00:35:43,476
- The Hinky what?
- Hinky Dinky.

480
00:35:44,268 --> 00:35:46,854
It was our supermarket. Um....

481
00:35:47,021 --> 00:35:48,689
I just wanted something else.

482
00:35:49,315 --> 00:35:50,858
What did you want?

483
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,655
More.

484
00:35:56,906 --> 00:35:59,116
Well, thanks
for coming by. Always a pleasure.

485
00:35:59,283 --> 00:36:01,202
- Great to put a face to the name.
- Thanks.

486
00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:03,746
We're gonna put
our heads together and discuss...

487
00:36:03,955 --> 00:36:07,166
...but I feel safe to say you can expect
to hear from us by tomorrow.

488
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:09,168
That's...

489
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,629
...fantastic. I look forward to it.

490
00:36:11,796 --> 00:36:14,590
We liked you when you came in here.
We like you more now.

491
00:36:14,757 --> 00:36:19,929
Well, thank you so much for taking
the time, and I will speak to you soon.

492
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,722
- Great to meet you, Lynne.
- You too.

493
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:22,932
- Perry.
- Pleasure, Kim.

494
00:36:23,266 --> 00:36:25,476
- Howard.
- It's Rich, actually.

495
00:36:25,726 --> 00:36:27,645
- Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
- No, no.

496
00:36:27,812 --> 00:36:30,523
I'm happy to be confused with Howard.
He's a good-looking man.

497
00:36:30,773 --> 00:36:32,275
Don't worry about it.

498
00:36:33,609 --> 00:36:35,152
Come on, I'll walk you out.

499
00:38:25,388 --> 00:38:27,056
Hi, I'm here to see Jimmy.

500
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:28,891
- He's in a meeting.
- A meeting?

501
00:38:29,058 --> 00:38:30,518
Have a seat.

502
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:39,652
And listen, I don't ever wanna hear
the word "permit" again, capiche?

503
00:38:39,819 --> 00:38:41,278
It's your funeral, dude.

504
00:38:41,445 --> 00:38:44,824
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- Just in the neighbourhood.

505
00:38:44,991 --> 00:38:48,494
- Great. Oh, and I want a dolly this time.
- What kind?

506
00:38:48,703 --> 00:38:51,998
- Western? Hustler? Pee Wee?
- Hey, watch your mouth around the lady.

507
00:38:52,206 --> 00:38:55,042
How should I know?
You're the nerd. Just make it cheap.

508
00:38:55,209 --> 00:38:56,877
Go on, get out of here.

509
00:39:00,715 --> 00:39:02,174
See you got your old car back.

510
00:39:02,341 --> 00:39:05,011
Yeah. The kidney people
wouldn't take it.

511
00:39:06,887 --> 00:39:08,139
Sorry.

512
00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:15,730
Wow, you finally got
your cocobolo desk.

513
00:39:15,896 --> 00:39:18,274
Finally got my cocobolo desk.

514
00:39:18,441 --> 00:39:21,736
Feel like it's a good omen
for what's next.

515
00:39:21,902 --> 00:39:23,446
And what's that?

516
00:39:23,612 --> 00:39:27,992
This. Solo practice.
Being my own man again.

517
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,081
So how'd it go with Schweikart?

518
00:39:34,457 --> 00:39:36,042
It went well.

519
00:39:37,376 --> 00:39:40,254
- Should be getting their offer tomorrow.
- That's fantastic.

520
00:39:41,005 --> 00:39:43,716
- I'm really happy for you.
- Thanks.

521
00:39:44,258 --> 00:39:48,220
You know what, we should celebrate.
Whataburger, on me.

522
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:51,265
I'm not taking the job.

523
00:39:52,099 --> 00:39:53,142
Why not?

524
00:39:53,309 --> 00:39:56,270
You were right. It's time for me
to be my own boss.

525
00:39:56,437 --> 00:39:57,980
Solo practice.

526
00:40:01,108 --> 00:40:03,569
What, you don't think
it's a good idea now?

527
00:40:04,779 --> 00:40:07,740
- Don't tell me you've changed your mind.
- No, I--

528
00:40:08,074 --> 00:40:10,076
I'm surprised, is all.

529
00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:14,371
Hey, I-- I said all along you're
too good for those clowns.

530
00:40:14,538 --> 00:40:17,750
This is-- Shit! Yeah!

531
00:40:17,917 --> 00:40:20,002
Wow, it's great.

532
00:40:20,211 --> 00:40:22,713
Good. To that end...

533
00:40:22,963 --> 00:40:25,508
...I have a pitch for you.

534
00:40:32,223 --> 00:40:34,934
Not Wexler-McGill, but...

535
00:40:35,101 --> 00:40:38,729
...Wexler and McGill.

536
00:40:39,522 --> 00:40:44,819
We find an office, share the housekeeping
costs, rent, electricity, everything.

537
00:40:45,069 --> 00:40:49,657
But I am Kim Wexler, attorney at law,
and you are Jimmy McGill, attorney at law.

538
00:40:49,865 --> 00:40:52,785
Both free to practise as we see fit.

539
00:40:53,911 --> 00:40:55,871
Separate firms under one roof.

540
00:40:56,038 --> 00:40:58,415
We're both headed uptown.
Why can't we share a taxi?

541
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:02,211
You do things your way,
and I do them mine.

542
00:41:02,378 --> 00:41:06,924
We'll have freedom, but we aren't each
trying to go it alone.

543
00:41:07,925 --> 00:41:11,971
Not partners.
Solo practitioners together.

544
00:41:14,056 --> 00:41:15,182
What do you think?

545
00:41:15,808 --> 00:41:18,102
I don't know what to say.

546
00:41:19,645 --> 00:41:21,105
Say yes.
