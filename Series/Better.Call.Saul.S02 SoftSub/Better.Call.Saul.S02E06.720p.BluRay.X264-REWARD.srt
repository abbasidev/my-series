Tomorrow we began our exploration

36
00:07:09,514 --> 00:07:11,682
Of course, I am open to requests.

37
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:14,477
That's right, all you gotta do is call me.

38
00:07:14,644 --> 00:07:17,980
Anytime. All right?

39
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,025
Bye. Call me.

40
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,195
Oh. Boundaries, Mrs. Nguyen.
Boundaries.

41
00:07:24,362 --> 00:07:26,739
Why are you here?
You lose that job already?

42
00:07:27,323 --> 00:07:28,491
I should be so lucky.

43
00:07:28,658 --> 00:07:31,911
You don't like your job? Boo-hoo.
Poor baby.

44
00:07:32,078 --> 00:07:34,163
You know, some people
work for a living.

45
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,332
No one gives us free cars.

46
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:39,210
- So why you here?
- This place is paid up.

47
00:07:39,377 --> 00:07:42,380
I'm within my rights as your tenant.
That's all you need to know.

48
00:07:42,964 --> 00:07:44,966
Do I smell coffee?
Have you got a pot on?

49
00:07:45,133 --> 00:07:46,676
Why?

50
00:07:47,552 --> 00:07:48,678
How about a fill up?

51
00:07:48,845 --> 00:07:50,763
You can afford to buy your own.

52
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,432
The faster I get coffee,
the faster I'm out of here.

53
00:08:02,692 --> 00:08:04,861
<i>Chào các cô,</i> ladies.

54
00:08:20,376 --> 00:08:21,794
Son of a--

55
00:08:22,962 --> 00:08:24,338
Ugh.

56
00:08:57,413 --> 00:08:59,457
- You haven't unpacked yet?
- Uh....

57
00:08:59,624 --> 00:09:01,626
Kevin and Paige are here.

58
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:03,586
Absolutely.

59
00:09:31,447 --> 00:09:33,866
I don't know exactly what Chuck
may have said to you.

60
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:37,370
But just so you know,
I did not ask him to step in on my behalf.

61
00:09:57,098 --> 00:09:59,016
Hi, guys. Sorry for the wait.

62
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:01,018
- Not a problem.
- Hi.

63
00:10:01,185 --> 00:10:02,186
Wonderful to see you.

64
00:10:02,353 --> 00:10:03,479
- Howard.
- Kevin.

65
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:06,023
Good to see you two.
Hi, Paige. Hi, Kevin.

66
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,984
- Great to see you.
- Please have a seat.

67
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:11,112
- Thank you.
- Kevin, how's your grandson?

68
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,407
Out of control,
running around in circles.

69
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:14,342
Hello.

70
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:16,427
Can I help you?

71
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,305
You know why I'm here?

72
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:22,391
He needs an answer.

73
00:11:28,564 --> 00:11:31,901
Respectfully,
I'm gonna have to say no.

74
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:38,199
You sure about that?

75
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:40,034
I am.

76
00:12:49,562 --> 00:12:52,731
Your Honour, the defence has made
the very reasonable request that...

77
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:56,026
...the plaintiffs produce their
medical records or, barring that...

78
00:12:56,193 --> 00:12:59,071
...a signed release so we can
examine the records ourselves.

79
00:12:59,238 --> 00:13:03,200
Your Honour, our client's medical records
have no bearing on this case.

80
00:13:03,534 --> 00:13:07,413
Medical records are plainly relevant as
they bear directly on our contention that...

81
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,207
...the plaintiffs are not
adequate class representatives.

82
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:13,419
This is a transparent attempt
at intimidation. Nothing more.

83
00:13:13,586 --> 00:13:14,837
How so?

84
00:13:15,004 --> 00:13:19,133
Many of our clients have information in
their records they prefer to keep private.

85
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:23,137
They're fearful at the thought of strangers
poking around in their personal files.

86
00:13:23,304 --> 00:13:25,347
By forcing them to
reveal this information...

87
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:28,601
...the defence is banking on them
dropping out of the case.

88
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:31,645
Your Honour, this is about
class certification, that's all.

89
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:35,357
If the plaintiffs are suffering from
dementia or other mental deficiencies--

90
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:36,984
You saying they're incompetent?

91
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:40,821
We have the right to any record that
speaks to their competency as regards--

92
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:43,157
It seems the defence
wants it both ways then.

93
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:45,409
If our clients are suffering
from dementia...

94
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:48,537
...the contracts they signed
weren't entered into knowingly.

95
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:51,081
- No. That is not--
- The defence wants to claim...

96
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:53,876
...their residents are competent enough
to be held to contracts...

97
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:56,837
...but too incompetent to sue.
So which is it?

98
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:59,548
Many of the residents
signed their contracts years ago.

99
00:13:59,757 --> 00:14:01,926
And at the time,
they were perfectly competent.

100
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:03,719
But that can change.

101
00:14:03,928 --> 00:14:06,555
Especially when we're talking about
elderly individuals.

102
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:10,643
Or Sandpiper preyed on incompetent
seniors and bilked them out of money.

103
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:12,478
Ms. Wexler.

104
00:14:13,521 --> 00:14:17,358
I am simply trying to defend our clients
from bullying by the defence.

105
00:14:17,525 --> 00:14:19,944
Your Honour,
as stated in the brief in front of you...

106
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:23,280
...this is a standard request
granted in every case of its kind.

107
00:14:23,489 --> 00:14:25,407
This is not about bullying.

108
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:30,120
Granting this invasion of privacy
allows our clients to be doubly victimized.

109
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:32,873
I ask that you deny
the defence's motion, Your Honour.

110
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:35,417
I'm leaning toward
granting the motion...

111
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:38,420
...but I would like to review
the pleadings and briefs again.

112
00:14:38,587 --> 00:14:40,381
I'll have my decision for you shortly.

113
00:14:40,798 --> 00:14:42,424
Adjourned.

114
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:50,808
I'm gonna meet you back at the office.

115
00:14:58,816 --> 00:15:01,652
Ms. Wexler. Hey.

116
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:04,405
I just wanted to say
good work in there.

117
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,949
Thanks, but I'm pretty sure I lost.

118
00:15:07,116 --> 00:15:09,076
Of course. It's an unwinnable position.

119
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:11,328
That's why your boss
didn't bother showing up.

120
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:14,665
But you went down swinging,
and I admire that.

121
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:16,041
Thank you.

122
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:18,252
What are you doing for lunch?

123
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:21,797
Um, probably just grabbing something
from the vending machines.

124
00:15:21,964 --> 00:15:24,717
Oof. We can do better than that.

125
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:29,388
- Mr. Schweikart, good to see you.
- How are you doing?

126
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:32,516
Very well. Can I get drinks for you two?
Your usual Moscow Mule?

127
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:34,602
Absolutely. You want one?

128
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:37,229
Best Moscow Mule in the city.

129
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:41,734
Fresh ginger, real copper mug,
the works.

130
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,321
That's very vintage, but I'm good.
Just an iced tea.

131
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:47,156
Ah.... You sure?

132
00:15:47,323 --> 00:15:50,784
I'll be the sole degenerate who's
drinking in the middle of a workday.

133
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:52,703
That too is vintage.

134
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,830
I'll get those started.

135
00:15:56,874 --> 00:16:00,294
So you've been with HHM,
what, 10 years?

136
00:16:00,461 --> 00:16:01,879
Uh....

137
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:06,300
- Yeah. Last August.
- And you started in the mailroom?

138
00:16:06,467 --> 00:16:09,595
I did. I was six years there.
How did you know that?

139
00:16:09,762 --> 00:16:11,805
Oh, I asked around. It's a small town.

140
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:15,100
It sounds like you certainly
paid your dues.

141
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:18,771
I was very fortunate. HHM put me
through law school while I worked.

142
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:22,858
That's great they foster talent. I imagine
you're paying it off as part of your deal?

143
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:25,527
Yeah, happily.
It's a pretty standard arrangement.

144
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,614
I have to say,
watching you in court today...

145
00:16:28,781 --> 00:16:31,408
...it sure did bring back
some old memories for me.

146
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:33,994
- One in particular, anyway.
- Yeah?

147
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:36,664
I was a year out of law school
at this firm in Boston.

148
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:42,002
And I was finally put on my first big case,
this huge employment discrimination suit.

149
00:16:42,211 --> 00:16:44,171
That thing kept us in billing
for a decade.

150
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:46,757
Anyway, we landed this monster.

151
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:50,761
And I find out I'm second chair to one of
the partners on the preliminary hearing.

152
00:16:50,928 --> 00:16:55,766
And I think, "This is it. This is what
will define the rest of my career."

153
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:58,644
So the hearing's
getting closer and closer.

154
00:16:58,811 --> 00:17:02,564
I even get this new suit that I can't afford.
I split it over three credit cards.

155
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:04,817
I'm probably still paying it off
to this day.

156
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,778
Heh. So I go in bright and early.

157
00:17:07,945 --> 00:17:12,032
I'm wearing my new suit, prepping my
table, and in walks the opposing counsel.

158
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:13,283
There's four of them.

159
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:16,870
One senior partner
and three high-level associates.

160
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:20,082
These guys have been litigating
longer than I've been alive.

161
00:17:20,249 --> 00:17:22,751
But I think, mm-mm. Mm.

162
00:17:22,918 --> 00:17:26,046
"I'm good.
I got my boss coming. It'll be fine."

163
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:31,552
So I'm sitting alone at my table
waiting for my boss to show.

164
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:33,220
And I'm waiting.

165
00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:36,724
And I'm waiting. And then suddenly,
they're calling us to order.

166
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:41,311
And I realise that no one
from my firm is coming. It's just me.

167
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:44,648
So I think,
"All right, then. This is the moment."

168
00:17:44,815 --> 00:17:47,693
And I get up there
and I argue like my life depended on it.

169
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:51,155
I'm sweating
and I'm citing statutes left and right.

170
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:53,907
And I'm doing okay, respectable.

171
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:57,745
But I'm just a BB gun
to these four howitzers.

172
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,957
And I lose, of course.

173
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:04,001
It was inevitable.

174
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:09,047
But later it hit me that my boss
never intended to show.

175
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,800
And they all laughed about it.

176
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:16,513
They patted me on the back, said it was
my trial by fire. And I laughed with them.

177
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:19,308
But, you know,
it never really sat well with me.

178
00:18:19,475 --> 00:18:21,852
You want them to have your back.

179
00:18:22,478 --> 00:18:26,106
Because at the end of the day,
it wasn't about proving my mettle.

180
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:29,860
My boss had a tee time
that he didn't wanna miss.

181
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,697
I wasn't there long.

182
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:40,788
Could I ask why we are here?

183
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:44,917
You know,
I've had my eye on you for a while.

184
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:48,629
Since that Kettleman thing.
It was an excellent deal you got for him.

185
00:18:48,796 --> 00:18:53,509
And I'm wondering why someone
who can put together a deal like that...

186
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:56,720
...is arguing a losing position
with no backup.

187
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:00,891
I have no complaints about HHM.

188
00:19:01,058 --> 00:19:02,726
That's great.

189
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:07,356
However, if on the off chance
that you're pondering a change...

190
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:10,859
...Schweikart & Cokely would be
happy to put your talents to good use.

191
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:15,864
We'd have to have a more
formal meeting, work out specifics.

192
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:18,659
But we think you would be a great fit.

193
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:24,206
Well, I'm flattered...

194
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:26,792
...but there's clearly
an ethical issue here.

195
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:29,002
Well, of course
we'd take you off Sandpiper.

196
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:33,590
Rest assured, we wouldn't be expecting
any information about HHM's strategy.

197
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:36,885
Look, we're a large, diversified firm.

198
00:19:37,052 --> 00:19:39,847
And just think what you can do
with our resources...

199
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:43,183
...and the freedom to
really spread your wings.

200
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:48,313
That's....

201
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:51,900
I owe a lot to HHM.

202
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:54,570
The tuition debt?
We could take care of that.

203
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:57,823
That's very generous.

204
00:19:58,991 --> 00:20:01,952
Well, give it some time to think
about it. You give me a call...

205
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:05,330
...and we'll set up a meeting
with the rest of the senior partners.

206
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:07,958
And to be clear...

207
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:10,586
...I'm talking partner track.

208
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:13,630
Jesus, Sean. What,
did you have to send to Moscow?

209
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:16,383
Sorry for the wait, Mr. Schweikart.

210
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,427
Are we ready to order?

211
00:23:33,872 --> 00:23:35,874
<i>--here for the Gourmet Quick Chop.</i>

212
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:38,835
<i>It's the fastest, easiest and safest way...</i>

213
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:42,130
<i>...to chop, mince or dice
any vegetable, guaranteed.</i>

214
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:45,383
<i>Here's how it works. Just place
the vegetable on the board...</i>

215
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:48,595
<i>...give it a tap. You've got finely
shredded cabbage in seconds...</i>

216
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:53,850
<i>...for crunchy coleslaw. Tap again
and chop celery for delicious stir-fry.</i>

217
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:56,895
<i>It even works on your
toughest vegetables, like potatoes.</i>

218
00:23:57,062 --> 00:23:59,022
<i>Make home fries with just one tap.</i>

219
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:01,525
Get down. Get down.

220
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:05,529
<i>--but not anymore. Quick Chop
peels and chops it with just a tap.</i>

221
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:07,864
<i>Keep tapping
for freshly minced garlic.</i>

222
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:12,577
<i>The secret is six carbon-steel blades
combined with the rotating action.</i>

223
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:15,914
<i>Each time you tap, it rotates and chops
on a different angle...</i>

224
00:24:16,081 --> 00:24:17,415
<i>...and never misses a thing.</i>

225
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:20,168
<i>One tap, and you've got
sliced onions for burgers.</i>

226
00:24:20,335 --> 00:24:22,003
<i>A few more taps, and you've got....</i>

227
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:25,549
- What's the message?
- Take the 5000.

228
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:27,717
It took two guys to tell me that?

229
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:32,597
We were just supposed
to scare you, that's all.

230
00:24:32,764 --> 00:24:36,601
Well, try harder next time.
Get out.

231
00:24:36,768 --> 00:24:41,523
<i>Almonds, walnuts, pecans. Quick Chop
even has the muscle to crack ice.</i>

232
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:42,732
Get out.

233
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:47,195
<i>Call now and you'll get Quick Chop
for 19.99. But that's not all.</i>

234
00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:49,948
<i>We'll also include
the Grater and the Gripper free.</i>

235
00:24:50,115 --> 00:24:52,576
<i>Remove the blades
and it instantly converts into....</i>

236
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:21,957
Oh, hey, Julie. Come on in.

237
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:26,920
- I've got those Sandpiper documents.
- Great, just put them anywhere.

238
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:29,673
Howard asked if you could
go through them now.

239
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:31,800
It's 1:15. I was just about to grab lunch.

240
00:26:31,967 --> 00:26:35,053
Yeah, he needs them done by 2:30
so he can draft a letter.

241
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:38,556
I brought these. Figured I could
petty-cash a lunch order for you.

242
00:26:38,723 --> 00:26:41,434
I got Accounting to approve
that new fancy salad place.

243
00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:05,792
Kaylee. Kaylee, come on,
not too far from the side.

244
00:27:06,626 --> 00:27:08,753
Throw the ball, Pop Pop.

245
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:15,385
When are we going home?

246
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:18,888
What, you don't like it here?

247
00:27:19,764 --> 00:27:23,059
- It's okay.
- It's okay?

248
00:27:23,226 --> 00:27:25,687
You got a pool,
what more do you want?

249
00:27:25,854 --> 00:27:28,982
- I guess.
- You guess?

250
00:27:29,149 --> 00:27:32,444
You guess?
Well, you wanna come out of there?

251
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,612
No, I'm staying.

252
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:36,614
You want me to come in there
and get you?

253
00:27:36,781 --> 00:27:39,326
I can't have you in a pool
that's only okay.

254
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:40,952
It's good, it's good.

255
00:27:44,956 --> 00:27:48,501
- You sure? You sure?
- I'm sure.

256
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:32,087
Kaylee, honey,
it's time to come out now.

257
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:33,671
Just a few more minutes.

258
00:28:33,838 --> 00:28:36,216
No, you do what Pop Pop says.

259
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:39,427
Come on, baby.
Before you turn into a prune.

260
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:18,902
Miss? The gentleman would like me
to let you know, your next drink is on him.

261
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:21,946
Let me know when you're ready.

262
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,558
I'm ready.

263
00:31:01,986 --> 00:31:03,488
Wasn't sure that was gonna work.

264
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:07,325
Don't tell me that's the first time
you've done that.

265
00:31:08,535 --> 00:31:10,453
So, what kind of return on investment...

266
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:13,331
- ...are you getting on these drinks?
- Mm.

267
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,832
None as pretty as you.

268
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:16,668
Oh, man.

269
00:31:22,131 --> 00:31:24,008
I'm Dale, by the way.

270
00:31:25,218 --> 00:31:26,553
Giselle.

271
00:31:38,982 --> 00:31:42,318
Okay, item number 44.
What do we have?

272
00:31:43,987 --> 00:31:47,949
Residency contract
for Abigail Hildreth.

273
00:31:52,453 --> 00:31:54,872
Abigail Hildreth.

274
00:31:55,665 --> 00:31:57,333
And what's the date on that?

275
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,628
Dated August 1st, 1999.

276
00:32:01,588 --> 00:32:04,591
August 1st, 1999.

277
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:07,468
August 1st, 1999.

278
00:32:07,635 --> 00:32:10,555
And do we have the corresponding
deposition for Mrs. Hildreth?

279
00:32:10,722 --> 00:32:11,973
Yes.

280
00:32:29,407 --> 00:32:33,494
Have you ever heard the expression
"a watched pot never boils"?

281
00:32:37,915 --> 00:32:39,250
Oh.

282
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:41,002
Here it is.

283
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:43,379
Thank you. See?

284
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:50,094
I've got her down as item 12.
Date of depo, September 15th.

285
00:32:50,261 --> 00:32:54,515
September 15th.
15th of September.

286
00:32:54,682 --> 00:32:58,227
- September 15th.
- Or-- Yeah, September 15th.

287
00:32:58,728 --> 00:33:01,773
Thank you.
Okay, item number 45.

288
00:33:07,904 --> 00:33:09,197
Jimmy.

289
00:33:09,697 --> 00:33:13,076
It's my grandma. She's old.

290
00:33:13,242 --> 00:33:14,911
Be right back.

291
00:33:16,579 --> 00:33:17,705
Kim?

292
00:33:17,872 --> 00:33:19,707
<i>How fast can you get downtown?</i>

293
00:33:19,874 --> 00:33:23,127
- Santa Fe downtown?
<i>- Albuquerque.</i>

294
00:33:23,336 --> 00:33:26,589
- Why?
- I'm at the bar at Forque...

295
00:33:27,131 --> 00:33:29,258
...and I've got a live one on the hook.

296
00:33:33,346 --> 00:33:36,224
I'm on my way. What's the shot?

297
00:33:37,141 --> 00:33:39,102
- Two or three.
- You don't think they do?

298
00:33:39,268 --> 00:33:41,354
- No. Well, no.
- They could. Ha-ha-ha.

299
00:33:41,521 --> 00:33:44,399
I know, but they don't have to
because we get it.

300
00:33:46,025 --> 00:33:49,404
That's possible but I don't
understand why that's an issue.

301
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:52,532
- You can always go back.
- Yeah, yeah.

302
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:56,077
Oh, Viktor. There you are.

303
00:33:56,244 --> 00:33:58,496
So sorry I'm late.
I had to put out a few fires.

304
00:33:58,663 --> 00:34:01,332
No problem. I made a new friend.
Dale, my brother, Viktor.

305
00:34:01,499 --> 00:34:03,334
- How you doing?
- Nice to meet you, Dale.

306
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:05,586
- Thanks for keeping sis company.
- My pleasure.

307
00:34:05,753 --> 00:34:09,424
You need a drink.
Let's get you a drink.

308
00:34:10,466 --> 00:34:13,386
- So, what do you do, Dale?
- I'm an engineer.

309
00:34:14,512 --> 00:34:16,681
What, like Casey Jones with a hat?

310
00:34:16,848 --> 00:34:21,477
No, idiot, an "engineer" engineer.
Not an engineer. Dale builds things.

311
00:34:21,644 --> 00:34:24,397
I design things.
Spillways and drainage fields mostly.

312
00:34:24,564 --> 00:34:25,857
I don't actually build them.

313
00:34:26,023 --> 00:34:27,650
Well, that's cool, yeah.

314
00:34:27,817 --> 00:34:29,777
You could still wear
the hat though, right?

315
00:34:29,944 --> 00:34:32,739
- I mean, nothing stopping you.
- Yeah, I guess I could.

316
00:34:32,905 --> 00:34:34,449
There's no rule about that...

317
00:34:34,615 --> 00:34:37,452
- ...as far as I know.
- You're a brat. Why the good mood?

318
00:34:37,618 --> 00:34:39,746
Did it go well today?

319
00:34:39,912 --> 00:34:41,706
Please tell me it went well.

320
00:34:41,873 --> 00:34:44,333
Yeah. It went well.

321
00:34:44,876 --> 00:34:47,503
Very well? Like very, very?

322
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:50,506
Beyond our wildest.... Yeah.

323
00:34:51,966 --> 00:34:53,342
Whoo! Ha-ha.

324
00:34:53,509 --> 00:34:57,346
- How many of these has she had?
- I am just getting started, baby. Ha-ha.

325
00:34:57,513 --> 00:35:00,850
Remember these faces, Dale. They'll
be on the cover of <i>Fortune</i> magazine.

326
00:35:01,017 --> 00:35:02,977
- Giselle, please.
- No, Dale's a good guy.

327
00:35:03,144 --> 00:35:06,230
- Yeah, but you're boring the man.
- No, no, no, not really.

328
00:35:06,397 --> 00:35:07,398
Thank you.

329
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,485
All right, I am off
to the little girl's room.

330
00:35:10,651 --> 00:35:14,489
Say only nice things about me
while I'm gone. Okay?

331
00:35:18,493 --> 00:35:20,119
She's something.

332
00:35:20,745 --> 00:35:22,038
Yeah.

333
00:35:25,792 --> 00:35:28,795
So Giselle was telling me
you two are starting a business.

334
00:35:31,214 --> 00:35:33,299
What exactly did she tell you?

335
00:35:33,466 --> 00:35:36,344
Oh, nothing much.
Just something about a dot-com.

336
00:35:36,511 --> 00:35:40,431
Some way for people to hook up
with each other using the Internet.

337
00:35:42,225 --> 00:35:46,312
Look, I'm sure you're a nice guy,
but she's talking out of school.

338
00:35:46,479 --> 00:35:49,774
- We're-- We're full up on this thing.
- Oh, okay.

339
00:35:49,941 --> 00:35:54,362
We sign one more investor,
we gotta go public. And I'm just....

340
00:35:54,529 --> 00:35:59,158
No. We cannot take anyone else on.

341
00:35:59,325 --> 00:36:02,954
- No offence.
- Oh. It's okay, yeah.

342
00:36:05,873 --> 00:36:07,542
No worries.

343
00:37:01,804 --> 00:37:03,598
Spread your arms.

344
00:37:12,982 --> 00:37:15,151
He wearing a wire?

345
00:37:15,318 --> 00:37:17,111
No.

346
00:37:17,278 --> 00:37:19,655
No wire, but....

347
00:37:19,822 --> 00:37:21,198
He's got a gun.

348
00:37:21,365 --> 00:37:23,701
I don't care about the gun.

349
00:38:17,213 --> 00:38:21,634
Tomorrow, you go to
the district attorney...

350
00:38:21,842 --> 00:38:26,347
...and you explain to him that
my nephew's gun was yours.

351
00:38:27,431 --> 00:38:31,477
The DA will ask you
why you didn't say anything before.

352
00:38:32,061 --> 00:38:35,398
You tell him you forgot,
you were rattled...

353
00:38:35,564 --> 00:38:38,192
...make up anything you want.
I don't give a shit.

354
00:38:38,359 --> 00:38:40,528
But it's your gun.

355
00:38:43,614 --> 00:38:45,700
Let's discuss my payment.

356
00:38:45,866 --> 00:38:48,953
That time has passed.
No 5000 for you.

357
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,830
The price is 50.

358
00:38:51,038 --> 00:38:53,749
How about your payment is
you get to leave?

359
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:56,252
Not enough.

360
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:59,714
Oh, you think
you can negotiate with me?

361
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:03,342
I say the word,
my nephews go to a certain motel...

362
00:39:03,926 --> 00:39:08,514
...pay a visit to your daughter-in-law
and your little granddaughter.

363
00:39:08,681 --> 00:39:10,808
What do you think happens then?

364
00:39:11,726 --> 00:39:15,688
Consider your position carefully.

365
00:39:16,689 --> 00:39:18,441
I get my money...

366
00:39:19,025 --> 00:39:21,277
...or neither of us walk out of here.

367
00:39:31,704 --> 00:39:34,373
You're willing to die for this?

368
00:39:36,751 --> 00:39:40,546
Maybe I need the 50,000
more than you do.

369
00:39:48,971 --> 00:39:53,601
I told you, right? Giant balls.

370
00:39:53,976 --> 00:39:57,772
How you manage
to live so long with a mouth like that?

371
00:39:58,189 --> 00:39:59,690
Hmm?

372
00:40:02,818 --> 00:40:04,779
Fifty thousand.

373
00:40:06,572 --> 00:40:09,909
And the gun is yours.

374
00:40:48,489 --> 00:40:51,200
- He sent you?
- I volunteered.

375
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:54,120
Only safe way for us to talk.

376
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:14,431
You really pushed it in there.

377
00:41:18,602 --> 00:41:20,437
That thing we did?

378
00:41:21,397 --> 00:41:24,191
He finds out, we're both dead.

379
00:41:24,358 --> 00:41:26,318
You get that, right?

380
00:41:27,194 --> 00:41:28,696
What thing we did?

381
00:41:34,827 --> 00:41:36,954
- What's this?
- Twenty-five thousand.

382
00:41:37,121 --> 00:41:39,957
- What for?
- We made a deal.

383
00:41:40,124 --> 00:41:42,501
I didn't hold up my end.

384
00:41:43,544 --> 00:41:47,798
Your problem is coming back
sooner than we expected.

385
00:42:05,816 --> 00:42:09,695
You gonna cash that?
I might know a guy who can help.

386
00:42:10,362 --> 00:42:12,239
It's better as a souvenir.

387
00:42:13,616 --> 00:42:16,994
I figured you'd be maybe,
I don't know...

388
00:42:17,161 --> 00:42:18,787
...a touch happier this morning.

389
00:42:18,954 --> 00:42:22,166
- Maybe a smidge, possibly?
- I am.

390
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:23,959
I'm totally happy.

391
00:42:24,126 --> 00:42:25,961
Why wouldn't I be?

392
00:42:27,671 --> 00:42:29,173
I, uh....

393
00:42:30,925 --> 00:42:32,968
I had a job offer.

394
00:42:33,302 --> 00:42:35,888
Really? From where?

395
00:42:36,055 --> 00:42:38,557
Schweikart & Cokely.

396
00:42:38,724 --> 00:42:40,017
Seriously?

397
00:42:40,184 --> 00:42:43,854
Rich Schweikart said they would even
pay off my law school loans.

398
00:42:44,021 --> 00:42:45,481
That's great.

399
00:42:45,648 --> 00:42:49,318
Please let me be there
when you tell Howard. Please.

400
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:52,863
So why the sad puppy eyes?
What, you don't want that job?

401
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:55,991
No, no, of course I do.
I mean, who wouldn't, right?

402
00:42:56,158 --> 00:42:58,827
It's a huge firm, you get out
from under Howard's thumb.

403
00:42:58,994 --> 00:43:00,579
Right. Exactly.

404
00:43:00,746 --> 00:43:04,583
Besides, HHM is looking more and more
like a dead-end for me anyway.

405
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:07,211
Exactly. So, what's the problem?

406
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:10,130
I just....

407
00:43:15,386 --> 00:43:16,845
I don't know.

408
00:43:17,805 --> 00:43:21,016
I keep thinking of you
floating in that pool.

409
00:43:22,476 --> 00:43:24,478
You knew what you wanted...

410
00:43:24,687 --> 00:43:26,689
...but I got in the way.

411
00:43:26,897 --> 00:43:28,190
What are you talking about?

412
00:43:29,566 --> 00:43:32,278
You took the Davis & Main job
because of me.

413
00:43:33,028 --> 00:43:35,614
I took that job
because it was the right decision.

414
00:43:35,781 --> 00:43:37,658
A steady paycheck? Done.

415
00:43:37,825 --> 00:43:42,037
A place to live that's more than,
oh, five square feet? Boom.

416
00:43:42,204 --> 00:43:44,832
A car that's all one colour? Nailed it.

417
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,168
- Heh.
- I'm good. I got what I wanted.

418
00:43:48,335 --> 00:43:49,962
And you with the Schweikart thing?

419
00:43:50,129 --> 00:43:52,589
You could have everything
you ever wanted.

420
00:43:52,756 --> 00:43:55,134
What's not to love about that?

421
00:43:56,844 --> 00:43:58,262
Yeah.

422
00:43:58,595 --> 00:44:00,597
What's not to love?
