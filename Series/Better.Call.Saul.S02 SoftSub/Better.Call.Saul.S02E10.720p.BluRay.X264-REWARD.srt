1
00:00:15,892 --> 00:00:17,936
Father Brady's in the chapel.

2
00:00:18,103 --> 00:00:20,939
Just push the call button
if you want to see him.

3
00:00:34,285 --> 00:00:36,663
When was the last time you ate?

4
00:00:37,205 --> 00:00:39,374
- What?
- Food.

5
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:42,377
- Have you had any lately?
- I'm fine.

6
00:00:44,087 --> 00:00:46,715
Come on, Chuck.
Let's go stretch our legs...

7
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:49,342
...get some air, a couple of hoagies.

8
00:00:49,509 --> 00:00:52,095
You wanna get a sandwich now?

9
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:54,681
It's just a thought.

10
00:01:06,693 --> 00:01:10,572
You remember that time I--
I accidentally invited...

11
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:14,576
...Kathy and Cheryl
to Mom's surprise party?

12
00:01:14,743 --> 00:01:17,620
It was kind of tricky
out on the dance floor.

13
00:01:18,413 --> 00:01:19,664
It was a fun night.

14
00:01:19,831 --> 00:01:23,501
I just remember the whole family
cleaning up after you.

15
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,923
And Mom leaving her own birthday party
to drive one of them home.

16
00:01:35,555 --> 00:01:38,016
Seriously, Chuck, we gotta eat.

17
00:01:38,475 --> 00:01:42,353
Mom will be okay for a few minutes. It's
been three days, it could be three more.

18
00:01:42,771 --> 00:01:44,814
Okay. Let's go, buddy.

19
00:01:44,981 --> 00:01:47,525
Jimmy, you wanna eat, go eat.

20
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:50,278
I'll bring you something. Um....

21
00:01:50,445 --> 00:01:54,282
Roast beef, no tomato,
Italian on the side.

22
00:01:54,449 --> 00:01:55,617
All right.

23
00:01:55,784 --> 00:01:57,076
Okay. Be right back.

24
00:02:44,374 --> 00:02:45,667
Mom.

25
00:02:46,626 --> 00:02:47,961
Mom?

26
00:02:51,714 --> 00:02:55,134
- Jimmy?
- No, Mom. It's me, Chuck.

27
00:02:58,388 --> 00:03:00,473
Jimmy?

28
00:03:00,974 --> 00:03:02,433
No, Mom. It's--

29
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,252
So this is it then?

30
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:30,795
I'm sorry.

31
00:03:30,962 --> 00:03:33,464
She has that DNR.

32
00:03:34,924 --> 00:03:36,801
Is your brother in the building?

33
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,721
- We can use the intercom.
- No.

34
00:03:54,277 --> 00:03:55,653
Charles.

35
00:03:56,237 --> 00:03:58,406
Is there anyone you want us to call?

36
00:03:58,615 --> 00:04:00,241
No.

37
00:04:25,141 --> 00:04:26,476
Hey.

38
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:32,857
Chuck. Hey, Chuck.

39
00:04:33,024 --> 00:04:35,568
Chuck, where's Mom?
What happened?

40
00:04:35,902 --> 00:04:38,029
- She's gone.
- What?

41
00:04:38,196 --> 00:04:39,739
When?

42
00:04:40,448 --> 00:04:42,116
How did--?

43
00:04:52,085 --> 00:04:54,963
Did she wake up?
Did she say anything?

44
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:01,511
No.

45
00:05:40,425 --> 00:05:44,971
Call 911. Call 911!
Ernie, get out here!

46
00:05:46,264 --> 00:05:47,265
What are you doing?

47
00:05:47,432 --> 00:05:50,476
- Hey.
- Come back tomorrow, it'll be half price.

48
00:05:51,644 --> 00:05:52,812
I need an ambulance.

49
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:53,980
- A guy fainted.
- I got paper towels.

50
00:05:54,147 --> 00:05:56,232
- Good. Something for his head.
- There's blood.

51
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:58,192
- Give me a cushion for his head.
- Okay.

52
00:05:58,359 --> 00:06:00,361
Yeah, hold on, hold on one sec.

53
00:06:00,778 --> 00:06:02,530
Chuck? Come on. Come on.

54
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:05,450
Yeah. Chuck. Hey, hey, hey.

55
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,202
- Hey, Chuck. You with us, buddy?
- The copy centre.

56
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:11,456
- Chuck. Buddy, you okay?
- 615 Gold.

57
00:06:11,664 --> 00:06:12,915
No, he doesn't...

58
00:06:13,082 --> 00:06:15,168
- ...look blue.
- Hey.

59
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:17,837
- We're gonna get you to the hospital.
- Lance.

60
00:06:18,046 --> 00:06:20,798
- Everything will be all right.
- I work here.

61
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:32,894
Hang tight, Charles. Almost there.

62
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:38,691
Watch yourself.

63
00:06:45,114 --> 00:06:46,324
Coming through.

64
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,331
On three. One, two, three.

65
00:06:53,706 --> 00:06:55,083
Transferring.

66
00:06:58,127 --> 00:07:00,755
This is Charles McGill. Late 50s.

67
00:07:00,922 --> 00:07:03,216
He had a syncopal episode
at a print shop.

68
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:05,468
Witnessed by an employee.

69
00:07:05,635 --> 00:07:08,137
Estimated loss of consciousness
was one minute.

70
00:07:08,304 --> 00:07:09,847
His vitals are stable.

71
00:07:10,014 --> 00:07:13,851
He's got a laceration on his forehead
that appears to need suturing.

72
00:07:14,477 --> 00:07:16,896
Charles, how you doing?
Can you talk to me?

73
00:07:17,063 --> 00:07:20,108
- Seizure activity?
- Not in transfer and none reported.

74
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:21,859
- No urinary--
- Unh. Unh.

75
00:07:22,026 --> 00:07:25,071
- Any family members?
- A brother in the waiting room.

76
00:07:25,238 --> 00:07:26,739
How much fluid did you give him?

77
00:07:26,906 --> 00:07:28,950
- That's the first litre.
- Lights.

78
00:07:29,117 --> 00:07:31,410
- What's that, Charles?
- Turn off the lights.

79
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:33,996
- Can't do that right now, sweetie.
- Oh, God.

80
00:07:34,163 --> 00:07:36,457
You fell and hit your head.
We need to do tests.

81
00:07:36,624 --> 00:07:38,751
- No, no.
- We need the lights to help you.

82
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:40,628
Charles, squeeze my hand?

83
00:07:40,795 --> 00:07:44,507
- Really hard.
- It's-- The lights.

84
00:07:44,966 --> 00:07:47,218
- What is that?
- Just checking your oxygen...

85
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:49,428
- ...Charles. Do you have any allergies?
- Ow. No.

86
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:52,598
- Are you on any medication?
- Unh. No.

87
00:07:52,765 --> 00:07:55,977
I'll move your arms and legs,
you tell me if there's any pain.

88
00:07:56,144 --> 00:07:57,979
- Did you get an EKG?
- The what?

89
00:07:58,146 --> 00:08:00,106
- Gentlemen, did we get an EKG?
- What?

90
00:08:00,273 --> 00:08:02,650
He's on a five lead now,
we didn't get a 12 lead.

91
00:08:02,817 --> 00:08:04,652
- No.
- Trisha, we'll need a 12 lead.

92
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:07,029
No EKG, no EKG.

93
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:09,115
Yes, Charles. We need to do an EKG.

94
00:08:09,282 --> 00:08:11,325
No, you don't understand.
I have a condition.

95
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:13,953
- Charles.
- I have a hypersensitivity to electricity.

96
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,372
Charles, please push your feet
against my hands.

97
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:19,208
--head and your neck,
make sure your heart's all right.

98
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,252
No, I have a condition.

99
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:23,629
- Can I get a light?
- I did not give my consent.

100
00:08:23,838 --> 00:08:26,174
- You have no right.
- We need to monitor your heart.

101
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,259
Take these out of here.

102
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:29,552
- Just relax.
- Charles?

103
00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:32,847
- Put the lights out please.
- Please stay calm, Charles.

104
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:35,892
You need to cooperate with us.
This is gonna be very easy.

105
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:38,811
We're just gonna draw a bit of blood,
suture your wound...

106
00:08:38,978 --> 00:08:40,354
...and do a simple CAT scan.

107
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:42,273
- No, no CAT scan!
- Calm, calm.

108
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,108
- No CAT scan!
- Can we get restraints?

109
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:45,943
- You don't understand.
- Come in here.

110
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,528
- Turn off the lights.
- Restrain him.

111
00:08:47,695 --> 00:08:49,238
- Turn off the lights.
- Charles.

112
00:08:49,405 --> 00:08:51,949
- You're killing me.
- Calm down, calm down, Charles.

113
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:54,702
This is gonna get everything
figured out for you.

114
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:57,288
We got you.
Just keep your head down.

115
00:09:19,435 --> 00:09:20,770
How's he doing?

116
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:24,857
I'd love to tell you, but we can't know
for sure until we do those tests.

117
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,696
- You know what I'm gonna say.
- Can't you go old-school?

118
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:34,450
Look at his pupils, use a stethoscope.
He doesn't want to be here.

119
00:09:34,617 --> 00:09:38,579
What he wants and what he needs
are two very different things, Jimmy.

120
00:09:38,746 --> 00:09:42,333
We don't know if he lost consciousness
because of a heart-related issue...

121
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,293
...or if it was a mild stroke.

122
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,546
We don't know if his spine has been
injured, if his brain has swelling.

123
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:50,091
He likely has a concussion at least.

124
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:52,468
Chuck is once again
refusing these tests...

125
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:56,138
...because they involve being
"bombarded by electricity."

126
00:09:56,305 --> 00:09:58,099
His words.

127
00:09:58,266 --> 00:10:00,768
Nothing has changed
since the last time he was in here.

128
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:06,148
- Look, I don't know how to explain this--
- I'm not committing him.

129
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:14,699
What about a temporary
emergency guardianship?

130
00:10:15,324 --> 00:10:18,035
I mean, he fits the parameters.
You're telling me...

131
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:22,123
...he's in need of medical care so urgent
that we can't wait on court procedure.

132
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:23,332
Most certainly.

133
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:26,043
And Chuck is not able
to understand the consequences.

134
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:29,130
- I mean, he can understand them, but--
- Absolutely.

135
00:10:29,297 --> 00:10:32,633
- A judge will see it that way too.
- Then I take him home and it's over.

136
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,137
Pending results
and proper treatment, yes.

137
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:40,308
I know a judge we can call right now.

138
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:48,232
Let me be the one to tell him.

139
00:11:10,171 --> 00:11:13,174
Hey, buddy. How's it going?

140
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:16,218
Chuck.

141
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:19,764
Well, if it isn't Johnny On-the-Spot.

142
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:24,060
- What? What does that mean?
- Is Ernesto out there?

143
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:27,146
- Yeah. Can I get you something--
- Ernesto!

144
00:11:27,313 --> 00:11:29,440
- Come in here, please!
- Just take it easy.

145
00:11:29,607 --> 00:11:31,609
Ernesto!

146
00:11:34,445 --> 00:11:36,030
Just put your stuff in there.

147
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:42,286
I got him.

148
00:11:42,787 --> 00:11:43,954
How are you feeling?

149
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:47,124
Ernesto, how long was I unconscious
in that print shop?

150
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,834
I'm not sure.

151
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:51,379
Thirty seconds? A minute?
Two minutes?

152
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:53,923
I'd say a minute, you were in and out.

153
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:57,385
And how long was I lying on the floor
before the ambulance arrived?

154
00:11:57,551 --> 00:12:00,304
About 10 minutes, I think,
but I didn't look at the clock.

155
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:04,266
And yet you were there.

156
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:06,727
Chuck, can we, uh--?

157
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:10,147
There's only one way
you could've gotten there so quickly.

158
00:12:10,314 --> 00:12:11,649
You never left.

159
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:15,403
I think you're getting all wound up.
Can you just take a few deep breaths?

160
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:18,030
You bribed him,
that kid behind the counter.

161
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:20,199
- What?
- Between the time Ernesto left...

162
00:12:20,366 --> 00:12:24,495
...and I arrived, you paid that halfwit
to swear he never laid eyes on you.

163
00:12:24,662 --> 00:12:27,248
And then you stuck around to watch.

164
00:12:27,415 --> 00:12:30,292
- Why? Just wanted to see me suffer?
- Mr. McGill.

165
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:32,002
Wanted to have a laugh at my expense?

166
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:33,546
I called him.

167
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:36,549
What?

168
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:38,759
I called Jimmy before I picked you up.

169
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:42,096
He showed up when he did
because I called him.

170
00:12:42,263 --> 00:12:46,308
I was worried about you and I just....
I called him.

171
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:48,269
I'm sorry.

172
00:12:52,398 --> 00:12:53,899
Get out.

173
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:55,985
Both of you.

174
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:13,544
Chuck, there's something that I have
to do, and I'm really sorry.

175
00:13:13,711 --> 00:13:18,716
I'm really, truly sorry, but I gotta do it,
and it's for you.

176
00:13:18,883 --> 00:13:21,218
You're trying to have me committed.

177
00:13:21,385 --> 00:13:25,264
- No, it's a temporary--
- Temporary emergency guardianship.

178
00:13:25,431 --> 00:13:27,683
Tomato, "tomahto."

179
00:13:28,184 --> 00:13:31,145
You finally got me where you want me.

180
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:53,626
You look beat. Why don't you
go home and get some sleep?

181
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:56,462
I'm fine to hang out, you know.
Whatever you need.

182
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:58,839
No, we're good here.

183
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:02,885
Hey, Ernie. Uh....

184
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:05,930
How come you said that,
about calling me?

185
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:07,556
I don't know, man.

186
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:10,518
Look, I didn't wanna say anything...

187
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:13,437
...but your brother, the way he's been
talking about you lately...

188
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:18,359
...it's like he's really out
to get you, Jimmy, and....

189
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:22,321
I don't know, you're my friend.

190
00:14:25,074 --> 00:14:26,742
Thanks.

191
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:32,456
I'll call you tomorrow.

192
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,377
I miss the mailroom.

193
00:16:17,853 --> 00:16:21,523
Are you familiar with
the Hippocratic Oath? You should be.

194
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,735
One of the oldest binding documents
in history.

195
00:16:26,362 --> 00:16:30,074
First, do no harm.
This is not the way to treat my condition.

196
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,369
It's as though I had an allergy
to penicillin...

197
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:36,580
...and yet you persist
on treating my infection with it.

198
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:41,377
I appreciate the analogy, Charles,
but I don't think it quite fits.

199
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:45,381
We'll have you in and out of Radiology
before you know it, all right?

200
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:47,591
Then we can see
about getting that neck collar off...

201
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:49,468
...and get you moving around.

202
00:16:58,644 --> 00:17:00,896
Okay, Charles,
the scan is starting now.

203
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:03,148
The table that you're on
is going to move.

204
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:05,943
You're gonna hear a sound
that might seem loud to you...

205
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:08,112
...but it's nothing to worry about.

206
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:35,973
You're doing good, Charles, good job.

207
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:42,938
We're almost there.

208
00:17:48,861 --> 00:17:51,280
<i>Okay,
Heather is a 27-year-old fitness freak...</i>

209
00:17:51,447 --> 00:17:52,489
<i>...who loved Preston...</i>

210
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:55,784
<i>...but openly admits
thinking of him as a walking wallet.</i>

211
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,036
Still no word?

212
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:01,415
Jesus, how long is this gonna take?

213
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:04,418
She said the whole test
would be like 10 minutes.

214
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,587
Maybe they had to start over.

215
00:18:06,754 --> 00:18:08,839
What, 20 times?

216
00:18:10,466 --> 00:18:12,176
He should be home.

217
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:15,304
Jimmy, you're doing the right thing.

218
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:22,019
Would you get your work out, please...

219
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:24,980
...because God knows
how much longer we're gonna be here.

220
00:18:25,147 --> 00:18:29,151
I'd feel better if you were doing
something, you know, unhospitally.

221
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:33,197
"Unhospitally." I'm on it.

222
00:18:33,489 --> 00:18:36,909
<i>Mr. Bergman? Mr. Bergman!</i>

223
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:43,123
<i>That was Preston's lawyer,
he thinks he knows who killed him.</i>

224
00:18:43,332 --> 00:18:44,374
<i>- Who?</i>
<i>- Who?</i>

225
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:47,336
You know what,
I'm gonna go ask for an update.

226
00:18:47,503 --> 00:18:49,296
Okay, yeah. Good idea.

227
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:51,757
<i>You are the greatest generation.</i>

228
00:18:51,924 --> 00:18:54,510
- Jimmy.
<i>- You didn't start World War II...</i>

229
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:56,678
<i>...but you sure as heck finished it.</i>

230
00:18:56,845 --> 00:19:02,142
<i>And if that weren't enough, you sent
a rocket 300 feet tall to the moon.</i>

231
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:06,855
<i>Now, in your golden years,
you need someone looking out for you...</i>

232
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:08,232
<i>...someone you can trust...</i>

233
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:12,444
<i>...a man who says what he does
and does what he says.</i>

234
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:16,240
<i>- When you need someone to count on....
- Give me Jimmy.</i>

235
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:17,491
<i>Give me Jimmy.</i>

236
00:19:17,658 --> 00:19:23,580
<i>Give me Jimmy, because moxie
is in such short supply these days.</i>

237
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:27,084
<i>Jimmy McGill, a lawyer you can trust.</i>

238
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:32,506
That's really good, Jimmy.
You made a really good commercial.

239
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,800
Thanks.

240
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:45,727
Jimmy.

241
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:49,064
Oh, finally.

242
00:19:49,273 --> 00:19:50,649
So how is he?

243
00:19:50,816 --> 00:19:53,694
Good news is that, physically,
he's okay.

244
00:19:54,278 --> 00:19:57,698
The radiologist said everything
looks normal with his head and spine.

245
00:19:57,865 --> 00:19:59,449
So we took his neck collar off.

246
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:01,493
His head wound will heal just fine.

247
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:05,163
We gave him a tetanus shot because his
immunisation records were not current.

248
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,999
I'm sure that's no surprise to you.

249
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:10,627
- And his heart?
- Strong. The EKG was normal.

250
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:12,671
As far as losing consciousness...

251
00:20:12,838 --> 00:20:17,342
...my best guess is Charles had
what's called a stress-related syncope.

252
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:19,678
It's basically a panic attack.

253
00:20:19,845 --> 00:20:22,931
No signs of stroke or cardiac event.

254
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:26,435
However, there was...

255
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,646
...a complication.

256
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,943
Chuck, hey, buddy, it's me.

257
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:39,197
They said everything looks good, so let's
get you out of here. What do you say?

258
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:48,665
What's wrong with him?

259
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:51,209
Whatever you gave him
should've worn off already, right?

260
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:53,295
We watched him for several hours.

261
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:55,881
We even gave him
what's called a reversal agent...

262
00:20:56,048 --> 00:21:00,010
...so, yes, the sedative wore off.
This is something else.

263
00:21:00,177 --> 00:21:01,511
What?

264
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:04,139
We think it's a state
of self-induced catatonia.

265
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:07,142
"We." Always with the "we."
I think it's you.

266
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:09,269
You're the only doctor in the room.

267
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:11,813
I think you fried his brain
with that machine.

268
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,066
- Jimmy.
- Sorry, this is bullshit.

269
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:16,109
Jimmy.

270
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:18,403
What next?

271
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:24,034
When I first treated Charles, he was
in a similar state, wouldn't you agree?

272
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:31,166
I have to believe that it's just a matter
of time before he comes out of it.

273
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:36,546
"Matter of time."
Fine, then, I'll wait right here.

274
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,477
Shot left, 1.5 minutes.

275
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:55,607
How many rounds
have gone through the tube?

276
00:21:55,857 --> 00:22:00,028
For a 7.62 you can put 3500 through it
and never know.

277
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:02,155
It's about how tight she shoots...

278
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:04,866
...and this one's tight as they come.

279
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:08,370
I'd say there's a breeze picking up
down range.

280
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:13,250
- Your barrel gonna be cold?
- Let's suppose so.

281
00:22:13,417 --> 00:22:16,128
Well, then you'd better have
paid attention to that shot.

282
00:22:16,294 --> 00:22:18,588
I better have.

283
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:24,761
Adjusting right, 1.5 minutes.

284
00:22:31,101 --> 00:22:32,728
Send it.

285
00:22:35,897 --> 00:22:37,024
Hit.

286
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,775
Centre hit.

287
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,282
I suggest you don't change up
your ammo.

288
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:48,160
Stick with the 168 grain boat tail,
hollow point.

289
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:50,412
If it's an open shot, that is.

290
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:54,124
Now, if you gotta shoot through
a heavy window, I'll up you to 180.

291
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:57,294
But as you know,
you'll have to recalculate the shot.

292
00:22:57,461 --> 00:23:00,047
One-sixty-eight will do it.

293
00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:05,010
- How many boxes?
- Just the one.

294
00:23:06,845 --> 00:23:08,805
No, it's on the house.

295
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:15,270
One last thing.

296
00:23:21,485 --> 00:23:22,652
No offence.

297
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:27,074
None taken.

298
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:22,170
Jimmy.

299
00:24:22,546 --> 00:24:25,173
- Can I get some water?
- Chuck.

300
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,217
Hey, buddy, you're back with us.

301
00:24:27,384 --> 00:24:29,594
- Are you...?
- Can I get some water, please?

302
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:30,762
Yeah, yeah, water.

303
00:24:40,564 --> 00:24:42,065
Oh, shit. Sorry.

304
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,360
Want some more?

305
00:24:48,947 --> 00:24:52,200
Last thing I remember
was that machine they put me in.

306
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:53,493
How long was I out for?

307
00:24:56,246 --> 00:24:57,706
It was 20 hours.

308
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:03,503
And next order of business,
get you the hell out of here.

309
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:05,589
Where to next?

310
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:08,508
Some insane asylum in Las Cruces?

311
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:12,012
Some place you can really tuck me away
but good?

312
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:14,931
Home, Chuck. You're going home.

313
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:18,560
Your heart's okay,
and so's that crack on your head.

314
00:25:18,727 --> 00:25:21,730
So that's all I wanted to know.

315
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:25,483
What about the TEG?

316
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:28,486
T stands for temporary, right?

317
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:33,533
You wanna go to bed?

318
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:37,204
No, no, it's-- It's cooler down here.

319
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:43,627
What can I get you?

320
00:25:44,169 --> 00:25:45,503
I'll make you some tea.

321
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:48,590
Uh, the good stuff. Not that brown water
they have at the hospital.

322
00:25:48,757 --> 00:25:50,175
I'm fine.

323
00:25:51,927 --> 00:25:53,887
- I'll make you some tea.
- Jimmy.

324
00:25:54,054 --> 00:25:55,347
No.

325
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,141
Just....

326
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:02,437
You've done your duty.
You can go now.

327
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:07,400
That came out a bit harsh.

328
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:10,987
Look, I've been zapped
and poked and prodded...

329
00:26:11,154 --> 00:26:12,822
...and now I just....

330
00:26:14,115 --> 00:26:16,034
I wanna be left alone.

331
00:26:16,952 --> 00:26:19,704
If things go south for you again,
how am I even gonna know?

332
00:26:19,871 --> 00:26:22,540
I'm fine. I promise.

333
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:26,211
See?

334
00:26:26,878 --> 00:26:28,838
I'm feeling better already.

335
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:32,133
I mean, I don't even have a key, so....

336
00:26:36,221 --> 00:26:37,514
Can I get Ernie back here?

337
00:26:37,889 --> 00:26:39,849
Would you let me do that for you
at least?

338
00:26:40,016 --> 00:26:42,894
You need someone looking in on you.
You gotta eat, right?

339
00:26:44,688 --> 00:26:46,189
All right.

340
00:26:55,782 --> 00:26:57,617
Feel better, Chuck.

341
00:35:41,933 --> 00:35:44,310
All right, I will get right on that.

342
00:35:44,477 --> 00:35:47,063
I should have it for you
by early next week.

343
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:50,358
You have yourself a wonderful day,
Mr. Collins.

344
00:35:56,489 --> 00:35:58,115
Oh, there you go. Yeah.

345
00:35:58,282 --> 00:36:00,660
Get the sunglasses out. It's very bright.

346
00:36:00,827 --> 00:36:02,411
Gotta protect the old peepers.

347
00:36:02,954 --> 00:36:05,164
You gotta....

348
00:36:05,331 --> 00:36:07,750
Yup, looking sharp.

349
00:36:07,917 --> 00:36:09,460
Bingo.

350
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:12,547
Uh, bye-bye now.

351
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:19,720
Okay. Folks, I'm sorry about the wait.

352
00:36:19,887 --> 00:36:25,601
But the attention I give each client means
sometimes things get a little backed up.

353
00:36:25,768 --> 00:36:27,270
Uh....

354
00:36:27,436 --> 00:36:29,438
But I promise to get to each of you
in turn.

355
00:36:29,605 --> 00:36:31,774
Mrs. Deshazo, my dear,
I believe you're next...

356
00:36:31,941 --> 00:36:34,402
...but first, may I get anybody
some coffee?

357
00:36:34,569 --> 00:36:38,197
- Can I talk to you?
- Excuse me one second.

358
00:36:38,489 --> 00:36:41,576
We have got to get a receptionist.
Like yesterday.

359
00:36:41,742 --> 00:36:45,079
Howard just called. Says he's been trying
to reach you all morning.

360
00:36:45,246 --> 00:36:48,833
So tell him to stop bothering you,
and leave me a message.

361
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:50,877
It's about Chuck.

362
00:36:51,127 --> 00:36:53,212
It's important. That's all he'll say.

363
00:36:55,256 --> 00:36:56,257
Okay.

364
00:36:56,883 --> 00:37:00,177
Unfortunately my associate tells me
I'm needed...

365
00:37:00,344 --> 00:37:03,014
...for some brief, but pressing
legal business.

366
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:06,309
I just need to make
one quick phone call.

367
00:37:06,475 --> 00:37:09,353
In the meantime, who was it
who wanted coffee?

368
00:37:10,771 --> 00:37:14,734
Yeah, okay.
This young lady will get you coffee...

369
00:37:15,192 --> 00:37:18,487
...and also doughnuts,
if there are any left.

370
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:20,031
<i>Please.</i>

371
00:37:28,372 --> 00:37:31,292
I want coffee, but I do not want cream.

372
00:37:31,584 --> 00:37:34,587
Hey, Julie, it's me returning
Howard's call.

373
00:37:35,379 --> 00:37:36,547
Yeah.

374
00:37:40,468 --> 00:37:43,304
- Hey, what's up?
- Jimmy, I have just one question:

375
00:37:43,721 --> 00:37:44,931
Are you behind this?

376
00:37:45,473 --> 00:37:47,266
Am I behind what?

377
00:38:19,507 --> 00:38:22,551
Jimmy, I'm kind of in the middle
of something. Come back later.

378
00:38:22,718 --> 00:38:24,804
No, no, no! Come on, open the door.

379
00:38:24,971 --> 00:38:27,348
I know why you're here.
We can discuss it later.

380
00:38:27,556 --> 00:38:30,059
Right now I'm busy. Goodbye.

381
00:38:47,326 --> 00:38:48,953
You happy now?

382
00:39:00,256 --> 00:39:03,384
It's not right, me not having a key
to this place.

383
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:08,472
Chuck?

384
00:39:38,836 --> 00:39:40,463
So, Chuck...

385
00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:42,673
...what's up?

386
00:39:51,974 --> 00:39:53,684
Um....

387
00:39:55,144 --> 00:39:57,229
You got a little, uh...?

388
00:40:00,775 --> 00:40:05,821
You got a little, uh, project going on?

389
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:10,367
Yeah, something you maybe wanna
tell me about?

390
00:40:12,161 --> 00:40:15,456
What do you say, Chuck?
Uh, clue me in?

391
00:40:16,499 --> 00:40:19,460
These walls are plaster and lath.

392
00:40:19,627 --> 00:40:22,379
Completely invisible
to the radio spectrum.

393
00:40:22,546 --> 00:40:26,217
No protection at all. I might as well
be standing in the middle of a pasture.

394
00:40:26,383 --> 00:40:29,637
I don't know what I was thinking.
Should've done this from the start.

395
00:40:29,804 --> 00:40:32,765
You should've done this?
With the, uh....

396
00:40:33,182 --> 00:40:37,686
- See, I think these walls are pretty solid.
- What I need is a proper Faraday cage.

397
00:40:37,978 --> 00:40:39,438
That's what I need.

398
00:40:39,647 --> 00:40:42,108
I think we need to sit down.

399
00:40:42,274 --> 00:40:44,151
Take a break, buddy? Please.

400
00:40:44,777 --> 00:40:48,405
Do not patronise me, Jimmy.
I'm not crazy, all right?

401
00:40:48,572 --> 00:40:51,951
I-- I never said you were crazy. That--

402
00:40:52,118 --> 00:40:56,539
You're probably exhausted.
And justifiably. Hey, come on. Hey.

403
00:40:56,747 --> 00:41:00,000
- Five minutes and then right back at it.
- I'm fine.

404
00:41:00,876 --> 00:41:02,378
Come on, Chuck.

405
00:41:03,796 --> 00:41:05,506
Just a break.

406
00:41:07,758 --> 00:41:09,885
- Careful.
- All right.

407
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,733
Oh....

408
00:41:28,779 --> 00:41:31,407
Howard tells me you quit HHM.

409
00:41:31,574 --> 00:41:33,325
I didn't quit.

410
00:41:33,868 --> 00:41:34,994
I retired.

411
00:41:36,078 --> 00:41:38,664
That's not what it sounded like.

412
00:41:38,873 --> 00:41:41,959
Regardless, it's kind of out of the blue,
don't you think?

413
00:41:42,168 --> 00:41:45,921
- He's worried about you.
- He should be relieved.

414
00:41:46,088 --> 00:41:48,424
Relieved? Why would he be relieved?

415
00:41:48,591 --> 00:41:52,136
You're his number one guy. Without you,
that whole place goes down the drain.

416
00:41:54,847 --> 00:42:00,895
So you-- You retired, not just from HHM,
but the law?

417
00:42:02,688 --> 00:42:04,732
That's not good, Chuck.

418
00:42:05,608 --> 00:42:08,903
The-- The law needs you.

419
00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:11,989
Just stop it.

420
00:42:12,156 --> 00:42:14,116
And you need it.

421
00:42:14,658 --> 00:42:18,245
What brought this on exactly, Chuck?
Huh?

422
00:42:20,331 --> 00:42:23,167
Because I don't know what you are
if you're not a lawyer.

423
00:42:26,253 --> 00:42:30,216
Hey, how are you gonna retire
before you get me disbarred?

424
00:42:30,382 --> 00:42:32,343
Before you run me out of town on a rail.
Huh?

425
00:42:32,509 --> 00:42:35,846
I'll be the only McGill carrying
the family name. You can't have that.

426
00:42:38,849 --> 00:42:42,770
Is this because you lost Mesa Verde?

427
00:42:43,771 --> 00:42:46,190
So what? Who cares?

428
00:42:46,482 --> 00:42:50,027
And hey, if you truly do think that I
ratfucked you on that thing--

429
00:42:50,194 --> 00:42:53,989
Which I did not, but whatever.
--well, you know what? You get mad.

430
00:42:54,156 --> 00:42:59,203
Take action. Don't just hide out in your
Faraday whatever. Your cage thing here.

431
00:42:59,453 --> 00:43:02,122
No! No retirement for you.

432
00:43:02,289 --> 00:43:04,833
When you're 99, you can drop dead...

433
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,711
...giving closing arguments
to Judge-bot 3000...

434
00:43:07,878 --> 00:43:09,797
...which will run on electricity.

435
00:43:10,005 --> 00:43:12,216
That's your future, okay? So--

436
00:43:12,383 --> 00:43:14,009
I....

437
00:43:14,718 --> 00:43:17,221
I can't do the job anymore.

438
00:43:17,388 --> 00:43:19,556
What do you mean?
Of course you can do the job.

439
00:43:19,723 --> 00:43:21,809
- I made a mistake.
- What mistake?

440
00:43:21,976 --> 00:43:24,687
A simple, nothing little bank address.

441
00:43:24,895 --> 00:43:28,816
1216 instead of 1261. I screwed it up.

442
00:43:28,983 --> 00:43:32,361
I hurt the client. Hm.

443
00:43:32,528 --> 00:43:35,406
I blew it, completely and utterly.

444
00:43:36,699 --> 00:43:38,534
And then I blamed--

445
00:43:38,909 --> 00:43:40,911
And then I blamed you.

446
00:43:43,247 --> 00:43:45,666
It's this goddamn electricity.

447
00:43:45,833 --> 00:43:49,128
It's wearing me down.
It's wearing down my faculties.

448
00:43:49,336 --> 00:43:52,840
My brain-- My mind--

449
00:43:53,299 --> 00:43:57,845
It used to be-- You know, it used to work,
and now it doesn't anymore.

450
00:43:58,762 --> 00:44:01,890
People got hurt because of me.

451
00:44:03,434 --> 00:44:05,185
Time to end it.

452
00:44:12,901 --> 00:44:16,113
What if I told you
you didn't make a mistake?

453
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:23,287
For chrissakes, Jimmy, stop humouring
me. Stop trying to talk everything right.

454
00:44:27,624 --> 00:44:29,710
I ratfucked you.

455
00:44:31,754 --> 00:44:33,589
It was me.

456
00:44:34,548 --> 00:44:37,009
I would've made Nixon proud.

457
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:43,599
I changed 1261 to 1216.

458
00:44:44,933 --> 00:44:46,518
It was me.

459
00:44:47,603 --> 00:44:51,231
It all went down exactly like you said.

460
00:44:51,398 --> 00:44:54,860
I mean, exactly.

461
00:44:55,194 --> 00:44:59,531
I doctored the copies, I paid the kid
at the shop to lie for me.

462
00:44:59,782 --> 00:45:06,413
It is insane how you got every detail
exactly right.

463
00:45:08,457 --> 00:45:10,459
So you can relax, okay?

464
00:45:10,626 --> 00:45:15,214
Because that brain of yours is chugging
along at a thousand percent efficiency.

465
00:45:16,715 --> 00:45:18,717
Are you telling the truth...

466
00:45:19,009 --> 00:45:21,678
...or are you just trying to...

467
00:45:21,929 --> 00:45:24,932
- ...make me feel better?
- I am saying it to make you feel better.

468
00:45:25,099 --> 00:45:27,726
I sure as shit wouldn't be telling you
otherwise.

469
00:45:28,394 --> 00:45:29,686
But, yes...

470
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:31,772
...it's the truth.

471
00:45:33,065 --> 00:45:35,692
You'd go to such lengths
to humiliate me?

472
00:45:35,859 --> 00:45:37,986
I did it for Kim!

473
00:45:38,946 --> 00:45:41,824
She worked her butt off
to get Mesa Verde...

474
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:45,953
...while you and Howard sat around
sipping Scotch and chortling.

475
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:49,164
Hamlin Hamlin McGill.
More like Scrooge & Marley.

476
00:45:49,331 --> 00:45:53,460
Kim deserves Mesa Verde, not you,
not HHM.

477
00:45:53,627 --> 00:45:56,130
She earned it and she needs it.

478
00:45:56,338 --> 00:45:58,382
I did it to help her.

479
00:45:58,549 --> 00:46:01,343
But I honestly didn't think
it would hurt you so bad.

480
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:05,139
I thought you'd say, "Oh, crap, I made
a mistake," and go on with your life...

481
00:46:05,347 --> 00:46:10,144
...like a normal person. But oh, no!
Wishful thinking!

482
00:46:20,737 --> 00:46:26,076
So can I tell Howard you're not quitting,
or retiring, or whatever?

483
00:46:34,376 --> 00:46:37,796
Can we take all this shit down
off the walls?

484
00:46:42,759 --> 00:46:44,928
I'm gonna go call Howard.

485
00:46:45,095 --> 00:46:46,513
Jimmy.

486
00:46:48,849 --> 00:46:52,936
You do realise you just confessed
to a felony?

487
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,105
I guess.

488
00:46:55,439 --> 00:46:57,608
But you feel better, right?

489
00:46:58,692 --> 00:47:01,653
Besides, it's your word against mine.
