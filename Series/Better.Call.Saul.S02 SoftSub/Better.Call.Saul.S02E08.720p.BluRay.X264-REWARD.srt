1
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:02,147
Go ahead.

2
00:01:06,651 --> 00:01:08,319
Turn to the left.

3
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,001
Clear the cab.

4
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,602
Step around to the back.

5
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,892
Okay.

6
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:54,527
Here you go.

7
00:05:52,145 --> 00:05:55,898
You know, I was willing to take
you to a more high-end establishment.

8
00:05:56,065 --> 00:05:59,777
This requires a proper celebration,
so don't think that this counts.

9
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:01,529
This is perfect.

10
00:06:03,114 --> 00:06:04,699
Besides...

11
00:06:05,575 --> 00:06:06,993
...we're pinching pennies now.

12
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,288
When we have steady revenue, make
the drive up to Geronimo every night.

13
00:06:10,455 --> 00:06:14,459
- Till then....
- Yes, that, let's make that happen.

14
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:17,962
Okay, here's what you gotta do.

15
00:06:18,546 --> 00:06:21,632
Type up your resignation letter now.
I mean, tonight.

16
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:23,509
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

17
00:06:23,676 --> 00:06:26,345
Well, I mean, finish your
hotdog first, but....

18
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:30,058
Now, you put that letter
into Howard's office tonight.

19
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:32,810
It's on his premises,
you've officially given notice.

20
00:06:32,977 --> 00:06:36,439
Tomorrow morning while he's still out
on the back nine chasing his balls...

21
00:06:36,606 --> 00:06:39,275
...call Mesa Verde and your other clients,
bring them along.

22
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:41,319
- You get to them before he does.
- No.

23
00:06:41,486 --> 00:06:42,779
What? No.

24
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:44,572
You gotta act now.

25
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:49,243
Listen, you do this the "right way,"
you wait, you tell Howard to his face...

26
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,954
...he'll sink his dirty hooks
into Mesa Verde...

27
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:54,290
...before you get the words "I quit"
out of your mouth.

28
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:57,752
Okay, Jimmy, I appreciate the advice,
but the whole point of this is...

29
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,463
...for you to be your kind of lawyer
and me to be mine.

30
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:03,466
I need to find a way to do this
that's right for me.

31
00:07:24,737 --> 00:07:27,281
Hey, Kim, can we make this quick?
I'm kind of swamped right now.

32
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:30,243
Sure. Thanks for meeting with me.
I only need a few minutes.

33
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:32,370
Great. What's up?

34
00:07:33,538 --> 00:07:35,706
Howard, could we do this
in your office?

35
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,543
Please.

36
00:07:46,217 --> 00:07:49,345
- Again, thanks for taking the time--
- You can just go ahead...

37
00:07:49,512 --> 00:07:53,015
...and rip off the Band-Aid. I have
a pretty good idea why you're here.

38
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,534
So you're going
with Schweikart & Cokely.

39
00:08:12,118 --> 00:08:15,538
- I'm sorry?
- I heard through the grapevine.

40
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,333
I'm not going to another firm.
I'm starting my own.

41
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,837
I figured I'd try giving it a go
as a solo practitioner.

42
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:27,967
Well, I, uh....

43
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:31,470
Wow.

44
00:08:32,096 --> 00:08:35,099
I realised it was something
I needed to do.

45
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:39,103
The week Jimmy exits Davis & Main
you decide to leave us?

46
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,898
That can't just be happenstance.

47
00:08:43,608 --> 00:08:45,193
It's not.

48
00:08:45,568 --> 00:08:50,281
We're gonna be sharing expenses,
one office but two separate practices.

49
00:08:50,448 --> 00:08:51,699
Smart.

50
00:08:52,158 --> 00:08:53,534
On several counts.

51
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:56,078
Howard...

52
00:08:56,996 --> 00:08:58,039
...I want you to know...

53
00:08:58,206 --> 00:09:01,751
...that I appreciate my time here.
I'm grateful for everything you...

54
00:09:01,918 --> 00:09:05,046
...and the firm have done, especially
the financial help with my schooling.

55
00:09:05,213 --> 00:09:07,840
I'm ready to write a cheque
for the remainder of the loan.

56
00:09:08,007 --> 00:09:10,635
- I need Accounting to get me that figure.
- No need.

57
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:12,303
Our gift to you.

58
00:09:16,224 --> 00:09:18,184
I don't know what to say. Um....

59
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:23,105
- Thank you.
- You earned it.

60
00:09:24,732 --> 00:09:26,901
Tell you the truth, I'm kind of envious.

61
00:09:27,068 --> 00:09:28,319
Really? Why?

62
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:30,863
Something about a fresh start.

63
00:09:32,073 --> 00:09:34,158
Back in the day,
right out of law school...

64
00:09:34,325 --> 00:09:36,327
...I thought hard
about hanging up my own shingle.

65
00:09:36,494 --> 00:09:38,204
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

66
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:42,583
I was ready to take on the world,
make a difference.

67
00:09:45,461 --> 00:09:47,797
Dad talked me out of it.

68
00:09:48,214 --> 00:09:52,802
Wanted me to join the ranks here,
throw another H in the firm's logo.

69
00:09:57,181 --> 00:09:59,809
Things work out the way
they're supposed to, I guess.

70
00:10:05,982 --> 00:10:09,735
Kim, I want you to know
that I always pushed you harder...

71
00:10:10,403 --> 00:10:13,614
...because I knew
that I could expect more from you.

72
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:17,076
Good luck to you.

73
00:10:19,203 --> 00:10:20,413
Thank you.

74
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:32,842
<i>Get me Kevin Wachtell at Mesa Verde.</i>

75
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:35,177
<i>Cancel everything
I have lined up this morning.</i>

76
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:36,971
Calling now.

77
00:10:48,441 --> 00:10:49,525
Sorry.

78
00:10:49,734 --> 00:10:51,319
Excuse me.

79
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:53,404
<i>Hi, Paige, it's Kim.</i>

80
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:58,242
Yeah, hi. Just checking that we're
still on for lunch on Monday.

81
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:00,453
Great.

82
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:03,080
And Kevin too? Good.

83
00:11:03,247 --> 00:11:07,043
Well, before we meet, there's some news
you need to know about.

84
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:31,103
I am not the safe choice.

85
00:13:31,479 --> 00:13:34,440
The safe choice for you
would be HHM.

86
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:38,694
I believe, however,
that I am the right choice.

87
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,779
Why?

88
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:44,617
That suit you're wearing,
did you buy it off the rack?

89
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:46,744
Please don't tell me it looks like I did.

90
00:13:47,036 --> 00:13:49,371
If it did, I wouldn't have asked.

91
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:51,957
So why do you prefer
a tailor-made suit?

92
00:13:54,043 --> 00:13:56,879
Because it fits you, and you alone.

93
00:13:57,046 --> 00:14:02,009
Because each and every stitch
was fretted over with you in mind.

94
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:05,513
Either you fit the jacket...

95
00:14:06,222 --> 00:14:08,057
...or the jacket fits you.

96
00:14:10,726 --> 00:14:13,687
What if I want a whole warehouse
full of suits?

97
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:15,898
That's a hell of a lot of sewing.

98
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,776
How is one single tailor
gonna get that job done?

99
00:14:18,943 --> 00:14:23,072
I know your bank's needs in regard
to this expansion inside and out.

100
00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:25,282
Having Mesa Verde
as my sole client...

101
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:28,827
...will take up the entirety
of my attention, to be sure.

102
00:14:29,078 --> 00:14:32,915
But if this were beyond my abilities
I wouldn't be throwing my hat in the ring.

103
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,668
I would not waste your time.

104
00:14:36,794 --> 00:14:38,420
Or mine.

105
00:14:49,348 --> 00:14:51,684
Hey, Kim, we're in here.

106
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:58,065
Perfect timing. I was just getting the tour.
Kim, this is Steve.

107
00:14:58,232 --> 00:15:00,192
- Steve's the agent for the place.
- Hi, Kim.

108
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:02,194
Nice to meet you. Hi, Kim.

109
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,572
Is everything okay?

110
00:15:04,822 --> 00:15:07,283
Huh, uh....

111
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:09,618
- Wow.
- What do you think?

112
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:11,662
I, uh....

113
00:15:12,788 --> 00:15:18,252
- I think it's, uh, a dentist's office.
- Two offices for two dentists.

114
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:23,090
Each the exact same size,
with a mirrored layout.

115
00:15:23,716 --> 00:15:29,805
Here, the other one is the next door over,
right beside this one, right here.

116
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:33,350
But they share one lobby,
one reception area...

117
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:38,188
...so egalitarian as hell,
not to mention, efficient.

118
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:39,690
Huh.

119
00:15:39,857 --> 00:15:42,401
Oh. Also...

120
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:46,780
...sound-proof walls. What with the
drilling and the pain and the whatnot.

121
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:51,493
And the location, I mean,
holy crap, I think this is the place.

122
00:15:56,624 --> 00:15:57,666
Kim.

123
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:01,378
Yeah, it's great, sound-proofing.

124
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:04,965
Hey, Steve, do you mind if we just....

125
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:07,551
Oh, please. I'll step outside to make
some phone calls.

126
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:10,387
Y'all take all the time you need.

127
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:14,183
Bad lunch, huh?

128
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,602
Mesa Verde said no?

129
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,866
Okay, I'm getting mixed signals here.

130
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:34,578
- Is this a good...?
- Jimmy, I got it.

131
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:38,207
- You got Mesa Verde?
- Yes. There's nothing in writing yet...

132
00:16:38,374 --> 00:16:41,710
...but the lunch went....
It kicked ass.

133
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:44,755
It was a little touch-and-go there
for a moment...

134
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:47,549
...but Paige pitched in
and she really talked me up.

135
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:52,179
- And then once that door cracked open....
- High five. Fantastic.

136
00:16:52,388 --> 00:16:55,933
I had an answer for every question,
every concern...

137
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,227
...and I did not badmouth HHM,
not at all.

138
00:16:58,394 --> 00:17:02,439
But I was like, "enthusiasm," you know,
and "personal service."

139
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:05,359
- That's gotta count for something.
- Shit yeah, that counts.

140
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:06,694
Exactly. So--

141
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:10,072
I mean, like, why were they even
at HHM in the first place? Me. So....

142
00:17:10,614 --> 00:17:12,241
Then when we walked out
of the restaurant...

143
00:17:12,408 --> 00:17:15,035
...when Kevin wasn't looking,
Paige gives me a thumbs-up.

144
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:18,497
But not the regular thumbs-up,
the double thumbs-up. Two.

145
00:17:18,664 --> 00:17:20,958
- Double-barrel.
- Boop, boop. Just like that.

146
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:26,714
- I knew it. I knew you could do it.
- It was just.... God, it was perfect.

147
00:17:31,719 --> 00:17:32,928
What?

148
00:17:35,139 --> 00:17:36,181
I just...

149
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:38,225
...I love seeing you like this.

150
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:42,980
So are we gonna keep these chairs?

151
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:46,024
Does that mean you like this office?

152
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:48,402
Let's do it.

153
00:17:48,652 --> 00:17:51,530
Hell, yeah. Let's do it.

154
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:04,209
Yeah. Ernesto, the door is open.

155
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:06,253
As always.

156
00:18:07,755 --> 00:18:09,590
Ernesto.

157
00:18:09,757 --> 00:18:13,427
- It's me, Chuck.
- Hey, Howard. Is Ernesto with you?

158
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:15,137
No, it's just me.

159
00:18:15,304 --> 00:18:18,140
Well, I expected a round of documents
an hour ago.

160
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:21,101
- We've got a filing coming up.
- I know, Chuck.

161
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:23,270
It's very possible....

162
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:26,648
It's likely that we're losing Mesa Verde.

163
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,735
Losing them? We just got them.

164
00:18:30,986 --> 00:18:35,199
- Why? Where are they going?
- They're going with Kim Wexler.

165
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:37,034
She left the firm.

166
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:39,286
Kim left?

167
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:42,623
Oh, Howard.

168
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,879
Well, where is she going?
Is it Rich Schweikart?

169
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:52,007
- Or did Reeves and Green get her?
- No, not another firm.

170
00:18:52,174 --> 00:18:54,885
- She's going into private practice.
- What?

171
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:56,970
Well, that's completely....

172
00:18:58,472 --> 00:19:00,974
How is she going out on her own?

173
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:03,018
Why is she going out on her own?

174
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:04,812
Well, the why is the why.

175
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:08,482
The how is that she's pooling
her resources...

176
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:10,275
...with Jimmy.

177
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:16,907
Kim and my brother...

178
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:18,951
...partners at law.

179
00:19:20,452 --> 00:19:23,747
He's Svengali. The man is Svengali.

180
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:26,333
At any rate, back to Mesa Verde.

181
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,710
I'm gonna try one last Hail Mary.

182
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:30,921
- Chuck?
- Hm?

183
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:32,673
- Mesa Verde.
- Yes, listening.

184
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,926
I got a meeting with Kevin Wachtell.
He's coming in this afternoon.

185
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:39,179
But compliance law
is not my strong suit.

186
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:41,723
So if you have any details,
any arguments...

187
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:46,061
...bullet-point them for me now. I've got
about an hour before I have to get back.

188
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:48,230
Chuck.

189
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:50,941
I really need your help here.

190
00:19:55,571 --> 00:19:56,738
Chuck.

191
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:03,787
Are you okay?

192
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:05,789
I'm going to that meeting.

193
00:20:05,956 --> 00:20:08,292
Chuck, I don't know
if that's a good idea.

194
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:11,712
I can do it. Force of will,
and I've been getting better.

195
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:16,133
I know you have,
but the message that we want to send....

196
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:20,429
I know the message, that we
appear professional and not crazy.

197
00:20:20,596 --> 00:20:23,265
I'm going to the meeting,
and the lights stay on.

198
00:20:23,432 --> 00:20:25,142
Everyone keeps their phones.

199
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:29,396
Everything stays,
for lack of a better word, normal.

200
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:32,566
I will make it through.

201
00:20:52,711 --> 00:20:53,754
Hm.

202
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,214
Yeah.

203
00:20:57,966 --> 00:21:00,677
- They're here.
- Okay.

204
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:29,247
Hello, everyone. Sorry I was delayed.

205
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:30,749
Not at all, we just sat down.

206
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,335
Kevin Wachtell, Paige Novick,
this is Charles McGill.

207
00:21:33,502 --> 00:21:34,962
- Chuck, pleasure.
- Kevin, Paige.

208
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:38,131
- Nice to meet you.
- Thank you both for coming.

209
00:21:38,674 --> 00:21:42,761
And don't worry, I'm not here
to extoll the virtues of HHM.

210
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:46,682
I'm guessing you've already had
to suffer through Howard's hard sell...

211
00:21:46,848 --> 00:21:50,602
...first time around, so you've done
your time as far as I'm concerned.

212
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:52,938
What hard sell? It was enthusiasm.

213
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:56,108
- I gave them cookies.
- Cookies were good, as I recall.

214
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:58,318
No, I'm here to put your minds at ease.

215
00:21:58,485 --> 00:22:02,823
Kim Wexler is indeed the right choice
to handle Mesa Verde.

216
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:05,117
She's the obvious choice.

217
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:09,538
She's young, she's brilliant,
she's going places.

218
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:13,458
Let's face it, Howard, she's the future.

219
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:16,461
Two old guys like us, we're the past.

220
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:19,381
Well, that's a sad thought.

221
00:22:19,715 --> 00:22:21,717
Sad, but true.

222
00:22:22,551 --> 00:22:26,388
Banking law needs to be exciting.

223
00:22:26,555 --> 00:22:28,473
It needs the next generation
to come along...

224
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,226
...and give it a big old kick
in the seat of the pants.

225
00:22:31,393 --> 00:22:32,686
Really wake it up.

226
00:22:32,853 --> 00:22:34,938
Let me tell you how boring I am.

227
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:39,026
I read FEC and ISO reports
for entertainment.

228
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:41,737
He does. I can attest to that.

229
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:43,780
Well, I try to stay up on things.

230
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:45,991
The rules are changing all the time.

231
00:22:46,158 --> 00:22:48,827
With everything that's happened
with Enron and Worldcom...

232
00:22:49,036 --> 00:22:50,704
...the government is extra vigilant.

233
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:55,333
These days the penalties for even the
most honest of errors can be devastating.

234
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:59,212
You need a sharp,
young eye to catch that stuff.

235
00:22:59,838 --> 00:23:04,176
I mean, when you've specialised in
this kind of work for decades on end...

236
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:07,679
- ...you tend to get kind of....
- Stale.

237
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:11,099
Stale. You get stale.
You forget about things like....

238
00:23:11,516 --> 00:23:13,643
Oh, I don't know,
the Community Reinvestment Act.

239
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,979
Any bank such
as Mesa Verde looking to open...

240
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:18,356
...a de novo branch
is definitely gonna need...

241
00:23:18,523 --> 00:23:22,402
...to show a healthy portfolio
of CRA compliance.

242
00:23:22,611 --> 00:23:27,115
Duh. Ha, ha. Obviously. You guys have
all that covered, I'm sure.

243
00:23:27,282 --> 00:23:30,952
Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking
and Branching Efficiency Act.

244
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:33,038
There's another mouthful, huh?

245
00:23:33,205 --> 00:23:34,706
Boring.

246
00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:38,752
Still, if you were to run afoul of it,
it could hold you up in court for years.

247
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:44,674
And by the way, if that were to happen to
you folks as you go forward without us...

248
00:23:44,841 --> 00:23:46,718
...which it will not, um...

249
00:23:46,885 --> 00:23:50,138
...Howard has contacts at the Fed
who could help sort things out.

250
00:23:50,305 --> 00:23:51,973
- One or two.
- Mm-hm.

251
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,769
And then there's the SEC's interpretation
of Section 302 of Sarbox.

252
00:23:55,936 --> 00:23:57,104
Blah-blah-blah.

253
00:23:57,395 --> 00:24:00,148
Well, navigating that correctly
could mean savings...

254
00:24:00,315 --> 00:24:04,194
- ...of several hundred thousand dollars.
- They know that, Howard.

255
00:24:04,361 --> 00:24:05,362
I apologise.

256
00:24:05,529 --> 00:24:09,116
When you reach your golden years,
you tend to get a little long-winded.

257
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:11,451
Ramble on and on about details.

258
00:24:11,618 --> 00:24:16,623
My point being your bank
is in excellent hands.

259
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:25,048
Look.

260
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:27,759
I take your point. I do.

261
00:24:27,926 --> 00:24:31,388
But I have to say I have
complete confidence in Ms. Wexler.

262
00:24:31,555 --> 00:24:32,931
You should.

263
00:24:33,223 --> 00:24:35,892
She was part of our team.
She learned from us.

264
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:38,645
You won't find better than Kim Wexler.

265
00:24:38,895 --> 00:24:42,232
But no matter how talented
one individual may be...

266
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:45,402
...the needs of Mesa Verde
are too big to handle alone.

267
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:47,988
I wouldn't handle
your coming expansion alone.

268
00:24:48,155 --> 00:24:51,992
Which is why you should
consider once again...

269
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,287
...enlisting a team of professionals.

270
00:24:57,706 --> 00:24:59,374
Glad we did this.

271
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:02,377
Anytime.
We are there for you day and night.

272
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:05,630
- Lovely to meet you, Paige.
- And you. Thank you.

273
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:07,382
Talk soon, gentlemen.

274
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,347
Chuck, that--

275
00:25:16,266 --> 00:25:17,517
That was amazing.

276
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:19,644
You were fantastic. Oh.

277
00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:21,354
Chuck?

278
00:25:22,022 --> 00:25:23,231
Get me home.

279
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,441
Ernie.

280
00:25:24,608 --> 00:25:26,067
Hang on.

281
00:25:36,953 --> 00:25:40,332
Again, we want to thank you
for accommodating the major like this.

282
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:41,791
You kidding? It's an honour.

283
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:45,295
For a war hero, I think we can
bend the rules a wee bit.

284
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:47,005
Well, we really appreciate it.

285
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:50,133
Major Talbott's grandsons are only
in town for one more day.

286
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,220
So it's great they get to share
this experience with him.

287
00:25:53,386 --> 00:25:55,430
You guys are in for a real treat.

288
00:25:55,597 --> 00:25:56,723
You excited?

289
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:59,100
- Yeah. Excited.
- Uh-huh.

290
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:00,810
So these are your boys?

291
00:26:00,977 --> 00:26:05,732
No, I'm-- No, I'm the family attorney.
I just help when I can. So I called you.

292
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:08,568
Well, I'm glad to be of service.

293
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:10,737
And here she is.

294
00:26:11,363 --> 00:26:16,534
Gentlemen, meet Fifi, the world's last
air-worthy B-29 Superfortress.

295
00:26:16,701 --> 00:26:19,412
She's based in Texas.
And she's here for a quick visit.

296
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:21,665
Just kind of a
morale builder for the airmen.

297
00:26:21,831 --> 00:26:25,543
The crew's on lunch. Otherwise, I was
gonna see about showing you inside.

298
00:26:26,503 --> 00:26:29,464
Isn't she a beauty, Fudge?
Just like the one you used to fly.

299
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:30,882
- "Fudge"?
- Yup.

300
00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:33,635
Major Theodore "Fudge" Talbott.

301
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:37,138
His mom used to mail him CARE
packages of fudge during the war.

302
00:26:37,305 --> 00:26:39,975
He'd share them with his friends.
That's the story, right?

303
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:41,184
Yes.

304
00:26:41,393 --> 00:26:44,479
Well, sir, this certainly
must bring back some memories for you.

305
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:49,067
Too many to count, he says.

306
00:26:49,234 --> 00:26:51,611
I gotta say, Major Talbott...

307
00:26:52,112 --> 00:26:53,446
...it's a privilege.

308
00:26:53,613 --> 00:26:55,156
So thank you for your service.

309
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,166
He says, "You're welcome."

310
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:09,754
Oh. Oh, boy, I envy you guys.

311
00:27:09,921 --> 00:27:12,716
The stories you must have heard,
you remember any good ones?

312
00:27:12,882 --> 00:27:14,509
- Bombing stuff.
- Bombing stuff.

313
00:27:15,093 --> 00:27:16,928
Like-- Like, the war.

314
00:27:17,137 --> 00:27:19,347
Did he fly over the Hump
or take off from India?

315
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:22,225
You doing okay?

316
00:27:22,392 --> 00:27:23,643
You need some water?

317
00:27:23,852 --> 00:27:26,646
Yes. Yes, sir. Oh.

318
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:28,523
Nuts. I forgot his water.

319
00:27:28,732 --> 00:27:31,359
Oh, hey, I can run back to the office.
Get him a bottle.

320
00:27:31,526 --> 00:27:34,863
You could? Fudge, the captain's
gonna run back to his office...

321
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:37,365
...get you some water, okay, sir?

322
00:27:37,657 --> 00:27:40,493
All right. That's great.
There's no rush. He's gonna be fine.

323
00:27:40,702 --> 00:27:42,203
I'll be back ASAP.

324
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:49,044
Up. Up.

325
00:27:49,294 --> 00:27:51,254
I thought I told you
not to say anything.

326
00:27:52,047 --> 00:27:55,258
Go stand by the front.
The nose. Whatever.

327
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:58,303
Where did you find this guy?
You couldn't get a real war hero?

328
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,513
Like they grow on trees.
This guy owes me.

329
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,516
- I defended him when he couldn't pay.
- Defended him for what?

330
00:28:03,683 --> 00:28:06,436
You wanna be a lawyer
when you grow up? Just fix the--

331
00:28:06,603 --> 00:28:09,272
Public masturbation. Total bullshit.

332
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:11,399
All right. Keep your voice down.

333
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:13,943
You do not possess
the power of speech.

334
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,154
Okay, let's go. Let's go. Chop, chop.

335
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:17,947
All right, hands on hips.

336
00:28:18,114 --> 00:28:21,076
All right?
Looking strong, looking proud. All right?

337
00:28:21,284 --> 00:28:24,120
See the bomber, okay?
The bomber's the main point, so see it.

338
00:28:24,287 --> 00:28:25,830
I see the freaking bomber.

339
00:28:25,997 --> 00:28:29,042
You couldn't plop the dude in front
of a flag? Why'd we come here?

340
00:28:29,209 --> 00:28:30,877
Production value. Showmanship.

341
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:32,837
- You rolling?
- Yeah, rolling.

342
00:28:33,004 --> 00:28:35,757
Okay. Start the dolly.

343
00:28:35,924 --> 00:28:37,425
Action.

344
00:28:40,053 --> 00:28:44,224
You're part of the greatest generation.
You fought the Nazis.

345
00:28:44,474 --> 00:28:46,601
Fought Japanese.

346
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:50,313
- What?
- Fought Japanese. I fought the Japanese.

347
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,235
This machine was used
in the Pacific where the Japanese are.

348
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,446
Why don't you shut up
and learn to take some direction?

349
00:29:00,865 --> 00:29:03,743
- Japanese.
- All right. Fine.

350
00:29:03,952 --> 00:29:07,330
You fought all the dirty Axis powers.

351
00:29:07,497 --> 00:29:13,002
Your band of brothers came together,
and you saved the world. You're heroic.

352
00:29:13,211 --> 00:29:15,880
Not that heroic.
Just throw it away a little more.

353
00:29:16,464 --> 00:29:19,759
Okay, good. You've got red, white
and blue coursing through your veins.

354
00:29:19,926 --> 00:29:22,011
Look up. Picture a bald eagle soaring.

355
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:24,764
- Shit.
- What?

356
00:29:24,973 --> 00:29:26,307
Okay, just keep rolling.

357
00:29:26,474 --> 00:29:28,560
Tights, wides,
just get me some good angles.

358
00:29:28,726 --> 00:29:30,437
Back to one. Back to one.

359
00:29:30,645 --> 00:29:32,605
Fudge. Fudge, right here. Fudge.

360
00:29:32,772 --> 00:29:33,857
What is it, Ernie?

361
00:29:34,023 --> 00:29:36,401
<i>Jimmy, man.
I'm at your brother's and he's bad.</i>

362
00:29:36,943 --> 00:29:38,069
Bad? How bad?

363
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:40,864
He's bad. Shaken.
I've never seen him like this.

364
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:44,534
- He keeps telling me not to call a doctor.
- He's been going into the office.

365
00:29:44,701 --> 00:29:48,580
<i>Yeah, more and more.
He had a big meeting there today.</i>

366
00:29:48,746 --> 00:29:51,624
Here's what you're gonna do.
Wrap him in his space blanket.

367
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:54,544
<i>- He's already under one.</i>
- Wrap him in a second one.

368
00:29:54,752 --> 00:29:58,506
Make him some tea.
Or just, better, heat some chicken broth.

369
00:29:58,673 --> 00:30:02,343
<i>- Just let it simmer. Don't make it boil.</i>
- That's it? No doctor?

370
00:30:02,552 --> 00:30:04,929
That's it. No doctor.
He's just gotta ride this out.

371
00:30:05,096 --> 00:30:06,931
Chuck will be fine.

372
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,184
Oh, sh-- I gotta go.

373
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:13,605
Rhubarb. Rhubarb. Idiots,
that's the signal. Get him in the chair.

374
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:16,357
Where's the air hose?
Stick it in your nose.

375
00:30:18,568 --> 00:30:20,111
Come on.

376
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:26,326
- Sir.
- Hey. This is not a problem.

377
00:30:26,826 --> 00:30:29,537
Do you mind if the guys and I
took a picture with you?

378
00:30:29,704 --> 00:30:31,498
- It would mean a lot to us.
- Yeah.

379
00:30:31,664 --> 00:30:33,917
Pictures! He loves pictures.
Give me the camera.

380
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:36,002
- Here's your water.
- Thank you so much.

381
00:30:36,169 --> 00:30:37,629
Thank you.

382
00:30:37,962 --> 00:30:41,508
All right. Let's scoot you in.

383
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:43,259
- Spin you around.
- Okay.

384
00:30:43,426 --> 00:30:44,427
Everybody line up.

385
00:30:46,846 --> 00:30:47,931
Smile.

386
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:49,557
Cheese.

387
00:31:14,457 --> 00:31:17,210
You ready to sign? Let's do this.

388
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,255
What?

389
00:31:23,967 --> 00:31:26,052
I lost Mesa Verde.

390
00:31:26,594 --> 00:31:28,012
What?

391
00:31:28,555 --> 00:31:30,348
I had him.

392
00:31:31,724 --> 00:31:33,351
I thought I had him.

393
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,687
So, what happened?

394
00:31:35,853 --> 00:31:38,856
They're sticking with HHM.

395
00:31:39,023 --> 00:31:42,360
Paige said they went over there
this afternoon for some kind of...

396
00:31:42,986 --> 00:31:45,280
...courtesy meeting, or so she thought.

397
00:31:45,446 --> 00:31:48,616
- And Kevin got his head turned.
- By Howard?

398
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:50,326
No.

399
00:31:51,703 --> 00:31:53,079
Chuck.

400
00:32:05,508 --> 00:32:07,719
Jimmy, I have to ask.

401
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:12,640
You still up for doing this?

402
00:32:13,725 --> 00:32:15,310
What, you mean getting the office?

403
00:32:17,186 --> 00:32:18,855
All of it.

404
00:32:19,188 --> 00:32:22,900
I think maybe we need to...

405
00:32:23,067 --> 00:32:27,280
...slow down and really,
you know, think about this.

406
00:32:27,447 --> 00:32:29,449
Wait, whoa, nothing's changed.

407
00:32:29,616 --> 00:32:32,619
Nothing's changed? We're about to
sign a very expensive lease...

408
00:32:32,785 --> 00:32:36,623
...after a very sizeable chunk of income
just went flying out the window.

409
00:32:36,831 --> 00:32:38,583
That's why we're a team.

410
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:42,295
Something like this happens,
you're there to help me.

411
00:32:42,462 --> 00:32:44,631
I'm there to help you.

412
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:45,923
Hey.

413
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:48,885
There will be other Mesa Verdes.

414
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:55,642
So you still wanna do this?

415
00:36:04,914 --> 00:36:06,457
Jimmy.

416
00:36:06,958 --> 00:36:09,669
I did everything you said,
but he's not getting any better.

417
00:36:09,836 --> 00:36:11,671
You did good, Ernie. Thanks.

418
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:15,633
Why don't you go home
and get some sleep? I'll take over.

419
00:36:16,175 --> 00:36:18,427
He told me he wanted me to stay.

420
00:36:18,594 --> 00:36:20,555
It's okay. I'm here now.

421
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:25,351
And next time you see Howard,
tell him you need a raise. A big one.

422
00:36:32,817 --> 00:36:34,861
Chuck? Buddy?

423
00:36:35,736 --> 00:36:37,613
How you feeling?

424
00:38:03,866 --> 00:38:05,076
Hey, how's it going?

425
00:38:05,242 --> 00:38:08,079
I need an X-ACTO knife,
a ruler, wood please.

426
00:38:08,245 --> 00:38:12,124
Hammermill premium paper,
20 pound, one ream and a glue stick.

427
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:14,502
Oh, and point me to your best copier.

428
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:17,505
- Best copier?
- Yeah, best copier. Come on.

446
00:41:56,557 --> 00:41:58,434
He emerges.

447
00:41:58,601 --> 00:42:00,519
Good afternoon.

448
00:42:02,396 --> 00:42:04,315
Is it afternoon?

449
00:42:06,483 --> 00:42:09,653
Where's Ernesto?
He was supposed to stay with me.

450
00:42:09,862 --> 00:42:11,322
Don't get mad at Ernie.

451
00:42:11,488 --> 00:42:14,992
He spent the day watching you
do your impression of a baked potato.

452
00:42:15,826 --> 00:42:18,787
I told him to go home.
Get some shut-eye.

453
00:42:19,622 --> 00:42:23,459
You hungry?
You want something besides crackers?

454
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:25,878
No, I'm fine.

455
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:35,387
I'll fix myself something
after my stomach settles.

456
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:38,140
Really doing a number on yourself...

457
00:42:38,307 --> 00:42:41,352
...spending so much time
out of the house.

458
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:44,647
You just had to do it, huh?

459
00:42:44,813 --> 00:42:46,690
Couldn't stand to let Kim
have Mesa Verde.

460
00:42:46,857 --> 00:42:49,485
- You had to swipe it from her.
- I didn't swipe anything.

461
00:42:49,693 --> 00:42:51,237
We retained our client.

462
00:42:51,403 --> 00:42:53,906
You and Howard never even
heard about Mesa Verde...

463
00:42:54,073 --> 00:42:57,076
...until Kim brought it to you
on a red velvet pillow.

464
00:43:01,747 --> 00:43:03,332
I need a shower.

465
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,501
And I've got a ton of work to do.

466
00:43:05,751 --> 00:43:10,506
So if you're looking for a fight, Jimmy,
I just don't have it in me.

467
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:17,721
Jimmy.

468
00:43:19,139 --> 00:43:21,392
Thanks for staying with me.

469
00:43:22,893 --> 00:43:24,770
I know we have our issues.

470
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:28,899
But if things were reversed...

471
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:32,528
...I hope you know that
I would do the same for you.

472
00:43:59,346 --> 00:44:01,265
You're doing a great job.

473
00:44:01,473 --> 00:44:03,058
You done this before?

474
00:44:03,225 --> 00:44:05,436
No. Not like this.

475
00:44:05,644 --> 00:44:08,439
But we learned about
fractions in school.

476
00:44:08,605 --> 00:44:10,816
You did? What fractions?

477
00:44:11,608 --> 00:44:16,238
Half inch, quarter inch,
eighth inch, sixteenth inch.

478
00:44:16,447 --> 00:44:19,616
Hm. Wow. You know, I gotta tell you.

479
00:44:19,825 --> 00:44:22,870
You are much smarter than I was
when I was your age.

480
00:44:23,037 --> 00:44:26,874
Maybe you needed better teachers.

481
00:44:27,458 --> 00:44:29,084
That could be.

482
00:44:29,251 --> 00:44:30,794
Can I do the drill now?

483
00:44:31,003 --> 00:44:33,005
- You promised.
- Oh....

484
00:44:34,506 --> 00:44:37,593
I did, didn't I? Huh?

485
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,887
Okay. Get up here.

486
00:44:41,221 --> 00:44:45,017
You're gonna have to wear these if you're
gonna handle the heavy machinery.

487
00:44:45,184 --> 00:44:47,102
Why don't you have to wear them?

488
00:44:47,269 --> 00:44:49,104
Because Pop-Pop's a grown-up.

489
00:44:49,271 --> 00:44:53,609
And grown-ups get to be stupid.
Now, put them on.

490
00:44:53,776 --> 00:44:55,736
All right. Now.

491
00:44:55,944 --> 00:44:58,280
I'm gonna hold this
because it's heavy.

492
00:44:58,447 --> 00:45:01,200
But you pull the trigger
when I say so, okay?

493
00:45:01,367 --> 00:45:03,118
Now get your hand on it.

494
00:45:03,369 --> 00:45:04,453
All right, you got it?

495
00:45:05,037 --> 00:45:06,080
Ready.

496
00:45:06,246 --> 00:45:08,957
All right. Ready. Set.

497
00:45:09,208 --> 00:45:10,376
Pull.

498
00:45:13,587 --> 00:45:15,672
- Good job.
- Can we do more?

499
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:18,675
Mm-hm. You line them up for me.

500
00:45:18,884 --> 00:45:20,010
Hello.

501
00:45:20,177 --> 00:45:22,429
We're back here.

502
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:30,396
- Wow. What's all this?
- We're making a special hose.

503
00:45:30,562 --> 00:45:33,690
Yeah, that's a special hose all right.

504
00:45:33,899 --> 00:45:35,901
I made marks
every three-quarter inch.

505
00:45:36,068 --> 00:45:39,571
Then Pop-Pop put a piece of wood down
so he doesn't ruin his table.

506
00:45:39,738 --> 00:45:41,532
Then we line up a drill.

507
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:45,202
- Put the hole in the X.
- Huh. Wow.

508
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:48,789
I needed a soaker for
the rhododendrons out back.

509
00:45:49,957 --> 00:45:53,961
Well, Pop-Pop's gonna have to finish this
project on his own. We have to go.

510
00:45:54,169 --> 00:45:55,546
But we're not done yet.

511
00:45:55,712 --> 00:45:57,172
No, I'll finish up.

512
00:45:57,339 --> 00:46:01,135
But you, young lady, were a big help.

513
00:46:01,301 --> 00:46:03,095
Give me a hug.

514
00:46:05,139 --> 00:46:08,100
Ooh. Love you, girl.

515
00:46:08,684 --> 00:46:09,726
Love you.

516
00:46:09,935 --> 00:46:11,145
Thanks, Mike.

517
00:46:11,395 --> 00:46:13,272
- You still good for Friday?
- Absolutely.

518
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,441
I'll think of another project by then.

519
00:46:15,607 --> 00:46:16,692
Fantastic.

520
00:46:16,859 --> 00:46:18,360
- Bye.
- Bye.

521
00:46:51,393 --> 00:46:52,978
<i>- I have a lunch date.
- Break it.</i>

522
00:46:53,145 --> 00:46:55,564
<i>I cannot break this.
Will you take your hands off me?</i>

523
00:46:55,731 --> 00:46:58,066
<i>- What are you playing, osteopath?
- Temper, temper.</i>

524
00:46:58,233 --> 00:46:59,276
<i>Oh, listen, Walter.</i>

525
00:46:59,443 --> 00:47:02,279
<i>You are no longer my husband
and no longer my boss.</i>

526
00:47:02,446 --> 00:47:04,072
<i>And you're not going to be my boss.</i>

527
00:47:04,448 --> 00:47:06,033
<i>It would have worked out...</i>

528
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,869
<i>...if you'd been satisfied
with being editor and reporter.</i>

529
00:47:09,036 --> 00:47:11,205
<i>But not you.
You had to marry me, spoil everything.</i>

530
00:47:11,371 --> 00:47:13,624
<i>I wasn't satisfied?
I suppose I proposed to you.</i>

531
00:47:13,999 --> 00:47:15,375
<i>Well, you practically did.</i>

532
00:47:15,542 --> 00:47:18,504
<i>Making google eyes at me for
two years until I broke down.</i>

533
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:20,964
<i>I still claim I was tight
the night I proposed to you.</i>

534
00:47:21,131 --> 00:47:23,383
<i>If you'd been a gentleman,
you'd have forgotten about it!</i>

535
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:25,052
<i>- Why, you--</i>
<i>- You're losing your eye.</i>

536
00:47:25,219 --> 00:47:28,555
<i>You used to be able to pitch
better than that. Hello? Yeah? What?</i>

537
00:47:28,722 --> 00:47:30,682
<i>Sweeney? What can I do for you?</i>
