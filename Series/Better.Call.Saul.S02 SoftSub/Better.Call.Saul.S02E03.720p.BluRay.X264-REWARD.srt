Howdy, folks.

15
00:01:08,194 --> 00:01:12,323
Could someone tell me if
Mrs. Alma May Urbano is on board.

16
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:14,534
Alma May Urbano.

17
00:01:15,994 --> 00:01:17,537
There you are.

18
00:01:17,704 --> 00:01:20,498
Hello, dear, very good to meet you.

19
00:01:20,665 --> 00:01:25,545
My name is Jimmy. I tried to visit you at
Sandpiper, but they wouldn't allow me to.

20
00:01:25,712 --> 00:01:27,756
Hey, you know what? It doesn't matter.

21
00:01:27,922 --> 00:01:31,676
I saw your bus broken down,
here you are, lucky me.

22
00:01:31,843 --> 00:01:36,765
Do you prefer to be called "Mrs. Urbano"
or "Alma May" or just plain "Alma"?

23
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:40,226
My last name is McGill,
but you can call me Jimmy.

24
00:01:40,393 --> 00:01:44,105
Hey, everyone, my name
is Jimmy McGill. I'm an attorney at law.

25
00:01:44,272 --> 00:01:48,943
But don't mind me,
just talk amongst yourselves.

26
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:52,489
Now, Alma May,
do you recall responding to a mailer...

27
00:01:52,655 --> 00:01:56,951
...from my law firm, Davis & Main
of Santa Fe, New Mexico?

28
00:01:57,118 --> 00:01:58,369
I don't know.

29
00:01:58,536 --> 00:02:02,457
Well, we were looking
to help any Sandpiper residents...

30
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:07,128
...who may have been overcharged
for basic goods and services.

31
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:11,758
- Now, does that ring a bell?
- Oh. Maybe. Was it yellow?

32
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:15,804
It's canary yellow.
I picked that colour myself.

33
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:19,432
Well, ma'am, I'm here to make sure
you get your money back.

34
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,477
What are you talking about?
Who took Alma May's money?

35
00:02:22,685 --> 00:02:27,690
Well, that's a very good question,
and thank you for asking, Mr...?

36
00:02:27,857 --> 00:02:32,445
- Amos. Amos Lydecker.
- Mr. Lydecker, Jimmy McGill.

37
00:02:32,612 --> 00:02:36,741
Now, nobody took
anybody's money exactly, okay?

38
00:02:36,908 --> 00:02:41,579
It's not like the Sandpiper people,
you know, put on a ski mask...

39
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:46,209
...and mugged Alma May
here at gunpoint.

40
00:02:46,376 --> 00:02:49,087
So I want you to put
that mental image out of your head.

41
00:02:49,254 --> 00:02:52,340
See, what we're talking about here
is just a discrepancy.

42
00:02:52,507 --> 00:02:58,096
It's a little thing. It's fairly innocent,
but we need to fix it.

43
00:02:58,263 --> 00:03:00,223
You follow me?

44
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,351
Well, put it this way:

45
00:03:03,518 --> 00:03:06,688
Alma May, let's say you're out
on a date with your boyfriend.

46
00:03:06,855 --> 00:03:09,774
You do have a boyfriend, right?
Aha-ha-ha. You don't?

47
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:12,569
Come on, you--
Alma May is holding out on me.

48
00:03:14,529 --> 00:03:18,741
- Do you have a nephew?
- Nephew? Oh. Yes. Steve.

49
00:03:18,908 --> 00:03:21,703
- Okay, Steve. Is he a good guy?
- Yeah, very good.

50
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:26,082
Okay. So let's say you
and Steve go out to dinner at, uh....

51
00:03:26,249 --> 00:03:29,335
Well, Birdie's. That's where
you're all headed today, right?

52
00:03:29,502 --> 00:03:31,045
- Right.
- All right.

53
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:36,634
So, both of you have a great meal.
It's chicken-fried steak and green beans.

54
00:03:36,801 --> 00:03:39,679
It's all perfect. Here comes the cheque.

55
00:03:39,846 --> 00:03:45,727
"Hey, wait a doggone-- Twenty-four bucks
for a side of buttermilk biscuits."

56
00:03:45,894 --> 00:03:48,646
- That doesn't sound right, now doesn't it?
- No.

57
00:03:48,813 --> 00:03:53,443
No, it does not. It sounds
like something got added up wrong.

58
00:03:53,693 --> 00:03:57,113
Well, naturally, you send your nephew
Steve to talk to the manager...

59
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,782
...and, naturally, the manager
corrects the mistake.

60
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:04,579
And what's more, he gives you a coupon
for a free meal next time you come in.

61
00:04:04,746 --> 00:04:07,081
- How about that?
- Good.

62
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:11,085
Well, same kind of thing
is what happened at Sandpiper Crossing.

63
00:04:13,755 --> 00:04:15,715
And nothing...

64
00:04:15,882 --> 00:04:20,929
...makes me sadder than to see people
of the Greatest Generation...

65
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:24,515
...people like my own Nana
and Bobo...

66
00:04:25,308 --> 00:04:28,311
...getting overcharged
by some great, big company...

67
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:31,230
...even if it was an accident.

68
00:04:32,065 --> 00:04:35,318
Now, I know that the good people
at Sandpiper...

69
00:04:35,485 --> 00:04:37,737
...wanna make this right,
sooner or later.

70
00:04:37,904 --> 00:04:39,113
But you know what?

71
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,909
Well, sometimes it's just easier...

72
00:04:43,076 --> 00:04:48,581
...if you get your nephew, Steve,
to go take care of it for you.

73
00:04:48,748 --> 00:04:52,877
And that's how I want you
to think of me.

74
00:04:53,795 --> 00:04:56,464
Georgiana. Hey, there, Georgie girl.

75
00:04:56,631 --> 00:04:59,384
Thank you. Oh, it's all there,
everything I need.

76
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,928
Thank you so much. Enjoy your lunch.

77
00:05:02,095 --> 00:05:06,391
Alma May, you did it.
Thank you so much. Thank you.

78
00:05:07,225 --> 00:05:10,520
Thank you, Henry. All right.

79
00:05:10,687 --> 00:05:13,356
Hey, Sue. Okay.

80
00:05:13,523 --> 00:05:16,359
Beautiful penmanship, a lost art.

81
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:36,129
Schweikart & Cokely are pursuing
an aggressive strategy...

82
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:40,425
...but looking at the relevant case law,
it won't play with this magistrate judge.

83
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:44,929
I've read over a dozen of her rulings,
all of which have sided with the plaintiff...

84
00:05:45,096 --> 00:05:46,764
...on cases like this.

85
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:51,436
I've included a memo to that effect,
which you can peruse at your leisure.

86
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:52,812
Thanks, Erin.

87
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:56,190
How about we move on
to client outreach.

88
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:00,570
Jimmy?

89
00:06:01,738 --> 00:06:02,947
You still with us?

90
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:06,159
I'm gonna save you
from having to brag.

91
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:09,412
Over 200 new Sandpiper clients
signed over the past three weeks.

92
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:12,874
- Well done, Jimmy.
- Thank you. Thanks, Cliff.

93
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:16,961
Right now we're in the process
of mapping out the entire Southwest...

94
00:06:17,128 --> 00:06:20,423
...targeting the largest
Sandpiper facilities first:

95
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:23,718
Phoenix, Colorado Springs,
Fort Worth, Provo.

96
00:06:23,885 --> 00:06:29,474
That's just for starters. Ideally, my goal:
another 200 by the end of the month.

97
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,933
With this many folks...

98
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,728
...we have an excellent shot
at a solid batch of plaintiffs...

99
00:06:33,895 --> 00:06:36,814
- ...for the classes in each district.
- Excellent.

100
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:39,400
Look forward to the next report.

101
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:42,695
On to a stickier wicket,
coordinating actions.

102
00:06:42,862 --> 00:06:48,534
Sorry, before we move on, I'd like to go
back to client outreach just for a moment.

103
00:06:48,743 --> 00:06:53,247
Looking over these numbers here,
really astonishing results, Jimmy.

104
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:54,874
Incredible.

105
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:59,837
Your last trip to Amarillo
you came back with 22 new clients.

106
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:02,048
- Twenty-four.
- Twenty-four.

107
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:04,008
I'm confused.

108
00:07:04,175 --> 00:07:08,554
How many people out there
actually responded to our direct mailer?

109
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,389
One.

110
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:13,935
Oh, right. Yeah.

111
00:07:14,102 --> 00:07:16,938
A Mrs. Alma May Urbano.

112
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:22,985
But you got 24 new clients
from this one response?

113
00:07:23,486 --> 00:07:26,906
That is.... Wow.

114
00:07:27,365 --> 00:07:30,034
Well, you're welcome.
I mean, what, is there a problem?

115
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:34,622
Well, might not some parties,
the opposing counsel for example...

116
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:36,833
...see this differential and conclude...

117
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:40,002
...that there may have been
some solicitation involved?

118
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:41,754
- I did not solicit.
- I'm wondering...

119
00:07:41,921 --> 00:07:43,840
...how you account for your success...

120
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:47,718
...because it will definitely raise eyebrows
over at Schweikart & Cokely.

121
00:07:48,678 --> 00:07:50,721
I'm sorry, but it will.

122
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:53,891
Particularly in a case
involving seniors...

123
00:07:54,058 --> 00:07:57,186
...for whom the ethical guidelines
on solicitation...

124
00:07:57,353 --> 00:07:59,564
...were virtually created by the ABA.

125
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,400
Chuck, I'm sure that--

126
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:07,864
Jimmy, if you could clear this up,
that would be helpful.

127
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:13,035
I went to Amarillo to confer
with a client and to make sure...

128
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:18,457
...that we had a solid, good-faith basis
for our case there overall.

129
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:23,212
As many of you are aware, I've visited
more than my share of retirement homes.

130
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:24,964
These are close-knit communities.

131
00:08:25,131 --> 00:08:27,508
Let me tell you,
word gets around real fast.

132
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:32,430
If Dorothy in Phase 2 gets
a new Rascal scooter, it's big news.

133
00:08:32,597 --> 00:08:35,099
So these other 23 residents,
they approached you?

134
00:08:35,266 --> 00:08:39,103
Cliff, they heard the scuttlebutt
before I crossed state lines.

135
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:42,273
And I certainly didn't have
to go knocking on any doors.

136
00:08:42,732 --> 00:08:45,443
And is it any surprise
that they wanna speak with a guy...

137
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,696
...who's there to show them
they may have money coming their way?

138
00:08:49,572 --> 00:08:52,325
I gotta tell you, with all that in mind...

139
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:54,619
...I should've done better.

140
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,289
Makes sense. Howard?

141
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:01,042
Chuck?

142
00:09:01,876 --> 00:09:03,544
We good to move on?

143
00:09:07,006 --> 00:09:09,634
Chuck, not incidentally,
it is absolutely vital...

144
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:14,180
...that we dot our I's and cross
our T's here. Invaluable. So, thank you.

145
00:09:14,347 --> 00:09:17,099
Well, the price of excellence
is eternal vigilance.

146
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:18,601
Indeed.

147
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:23,272
Coordination.
I believe that's where we left off.

148
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:26,943
That's right. Brian, this is your thing,
so why don't you take this.

149
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:30,529
Sure. Ahem. Considering the dimensions
of these cases...

150
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:34,700
...taken together and individually,
it makes sense to designate someone...

151
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:36,661
...to handle the scheduling.

152
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:40,831
What I'm proposing is we create a small
team at D&M dedicated specifically...

153
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:43,709
...to coordinating all elements
of the individual actions.

154
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:48,631
- We'll loop in HHM on anything--
- I'm sorry. Excuse me for interrupting.

155
00:09:48,798 --> 00:09:52,551
I just wanna say
that I take Chuck's point, I do.

156
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:56,389
I mean, this is like
a "wife of Caesar" type thing.

157
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:59,850
There can't even be a hint
of solicitation...

158
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:02,103
...so I'm gonna pull back.

159
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:06,565
All right, no more meet-and-greets
at Sandpiper facilities.

160
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:09,277
I'll find another way to proceed.

161
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,487
Jimmy, we'll leave that up to you.

162
00:10:11,654 --> 00:10:13,739
You know,
client outreach is your department.

163
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,117
Uh.... Where was I?

164
00:10:16,284 --> 00:10:17,868
Okay, right.

165
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:22,039
If we have a more consolidated nerve
centre here in New Mexico where the....

166
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,633
Hey, Kim, where can I get a copy
of that Niederman deposition?

167
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,678
I've got an extra Niederman, Jimmy.
You can have one of mine.

168
00:10:35,845 --> 00:10:38,514
- Wow. Thanks, Erin.
- No worries.

169
00:10:39,265 --> 00:10:42,685
- Oh, shoot, where did I put that?
- Thanks, that's....

170
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:49,900
Man, you believe Chuck in there?
Jesus, solicitation?

171
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:52,403
Let me tell you,
when we were building this case...

172
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:54,989
...I was chasing down 80-year-old
mall-walkers.

173
00:10:55,156 --> 00:10:59,285
That was solicitation,
but did he say "boo"? Bullshit, he did.

174
00:10:59,452 --> 00:11:01,662
What happened in Texas?

175
00:11:02,163 --> 00:11:03,914
Nothing.

176
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:06,751
- I did my job.
- No song-and-dance in the day room...

177
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:10,421
- ...for the old-timers?
- No. No.

178
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:14,133
- Not in the day room.
- Solicitation can get you disbarred.

179
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,470
- This matters.
- Well, here's what I think matters:

180
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:20,097
Twenty-four senior citizens
now have representation.

181
00:11:20,264 --> 00:11:22,808
Before, they didn't know
they were getting ripped off.

182
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:26,854
Now they have us in their corner.
How is that not a win?

183
00:11:27,188 --> 00:11:29,774
You said in there
you'd find another way.

184
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,650
Did you mean it?

185
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:35,446
- Sure. Absolutely, I'll....
- Oh, it's just....

186
00:11:39,075 --> 00:11:40,910
Look, I....

187
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:45,206
I need you to understand something
very critical here.

188
00:11:45,373 --> 00:11:46,499
Shoot.

189
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:51,045
I put myself on the line
to get you this job.

190
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:56,384
Okay. I thought it was because
I'm sensational with old people.

191
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,178
Yeah, and who do you think
told them that?

192
00:11:59,345 --> 00:12:03,849
- So, what, you threw me a bone?
- No, asshole.

193
00:12:04,016 --> 00:12:05,810
You know I believe in you.

194
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,939
But then I made my beliefs known
to them.

195
00:12:10,106 --> 00:12:12,900
And now everything you do
reflects back on me with Howard...

196
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:16,529
...because ultimately I talked him into
going out on a limb for you too.

197
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,992
Do you understand?
It's my word, it's my judgement.

198
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,202
Yeah.

199
00:12:28,499 --> 00:12:31,335
You and I both know
you can do this job.

200
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:39,093
But, please, you just have to do it right.

201
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:55,818
Yeah, you wanna make sure you
put in the batteries the right way...

202
00:12:55,985 --> 00:12:57,570
...or it won't work.

203
00:12:57,736 --> 00:13:02,616
Then you close them up,
and I think--

204
00:13:02,992 --> 00:13:05,744
I think you're good to go, young lady.

205
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:09,707
Why don't you give his foot
a squeeze.

206
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:16,088
He's funny.

207
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:18,299
Oh, darling.

208
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:21,927
I'm gonna name you...

209
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:24,847
...Mr. Snuggly.

210
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:28,309
Are you hungry?

211
00:13:29,018 --> 00:13:30,811
I'm gonna get you some....

212
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:33,397
That should get you through
to next month.

213
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:36,609
Mike, thank you.

214
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:40,321
- But you shouldn't feel that you need to--
- Too late.

215
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:48,829
- Something up?
- Mm.

216
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:52,374
- Feels like something is up.
- No, it's....

217
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:56,003
- I didn't get much sleep. My head is....
- I'm sorry.

218
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,548
You tell me it's none of my business,
I'll drop it.

219
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:03,344
- I don't want you to worry.
- Not the worrying kind.

220
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:09,141
Last two nights I heard gunshots.

221
00:14:09,934 --> 00:14:13,687
First night, they were maybe a block
or two over, woke me up.

222
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:17,107
My first thought was firecrackers.
That's what I assumed at the time.

223
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:19,818
But then last night,
there's no mistaking it.

224
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:22,571
There was three of them.
They were quick: Pop, pop, pop.

225
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:26,450
Closer, like they were
right outside the house.

226
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:29,161
- You call the cops?
- Yeah.

227
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:32,831
Took them over an hour to get here,
they looked around for two minutes...

228
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:35,167
...but by then
there was nothing to see.

229
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:41,340
- I'm staying here tonight.
- No. Mike, no, that's not necessary.

230
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:47,721
- It is not a problem. I'll take the couch.
- Mike, you asked, so I answered.

231
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:50,599
Please, don't make me sorry I told you.

232
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:57,940
Kaylee, come. Hm?

233
00:14:58,357 --> 00:15:00,192
Get your supper.

234
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:20,170
What about Colorado Springs?

235
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:21,714
Um....

236
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:26,510
Two hundred eighty-three residents,
and we sent out 283 mailers.

237
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:29,430
Yeah, and how many response cards
came back?

238
00:15:29,722 --> 00:15:32,558
- Zero.
- Zero?

239
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:37,271
Son of a bitch.

240
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:41,442
- Dana, Toni, have a good one.
- You too, Mr. Main.

241
00:15:41,609 --> 00:15:44,403
Cliff, can I have a second?

242
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:48,073
- What's up?
- Yeah, it's the Sandpiper mailers.

243
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,493
We should be getting responses
of like 12 to 15 percent...

244
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:55,164
...but we're getting ones and twos,
in Colorado Springs: zero.

245
00:15:55,331 --> 00:15:57,041
Wow. How can that be?

246
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,751
I'm thinking it's the staff.

247
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:01,462
They're tossing the mailers before they
can reach the residents.

248
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:04,590
Maybe they got told to do it
by the Sandpiper front office...

249
00:16:04,757 --> 00:16:06,717
...which would be actionable as hell.

250
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:09,720
If we could prove it. Big "if."

251
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:12,640
And to do so would take
more manpower than I can spare.

252
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:15,392
Let's just stick with
getting those client numbers up.

253
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:18,812
- Guess you better think of another way.
- I think I got it.

254
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:21,190
TV commercial, highly targeted.

255
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:25,361
Let me tell you,
at Sandpiper the trains run on time.

256
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:27,655
Mussolini would be proud.

257
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:30,991
Everyone I've visited so far,
same exact schedule.

258
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:34,787
Ten a.m., water aerobics,
2 p.m., line dancing, so on and so forth.

259
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:40,334
They always leave 3 p.m. to 4 p.m.
free. Why? <i>Murder She Wrote.</i> Heh.

260
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:42,795
It's been in syndication
since like the 1850s.

261
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:44,963
Let me tell you,
when that thing comes on...

262
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,549
...it draws blue-hairs
like moths to a bug zapper.

263
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:51,637
Three-fourteen p.m.,
end of the first act cliffhanger...

264
00:16:51,804 --> 00:16:54,348
...first commercial up: Davis & Main.

265
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:56,517
Guaranteed eyeballs, lots of them.

266
00:16:56,684 --> 00:16:58,435
There's nothing Sandpiper
can do about that.

267
00:16:58,602 --> 00:17:02,439
We ran a commercial a few years back,
another class-action case...

268
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:04,775
...kind of a new thing for us.

269
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:08,362
It's not exactly my go-to, but,
generally speaking, I'm open to it.

270
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:12,157
- We will talk next week.
- Great.

271
00:17:12,324 --> 00:17:14,159
Safe travels.

272
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:37,015
<i>If you or a family member...</i>

273
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:39,143
<i>...have been diagnosed
with mesothelioma...</i>

274
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:43,313
<i>...or related conditions, you may be
entitled to monetary damages.</i>

275
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,483
<i>Mesothelioma is a rare lung disease
usually associated...</i>

276
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:49,611
<i>...with exposure to asbestos,
a known human carcinogen.</i>

277
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:54,366
<i>Long-term inhalation of asbestos fibres
can cause serious or fatal illnesses...</i>

278
00:17:54,533 --> 00:17:57,953
<i>...including malignant lung cancer,
mesothelioma and asbestosis.</i>

279
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,498
Remember, they worked really hard
to get that just right.

280
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:05,753
- To get what just right?
- The swirl.

281
00:18:06,587 --> 00:18:09,631
They wanted kind of nebulous,
but not too nebulous.

282
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:11,884
Then there was the issue of the speed.

283
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,928
I remember there were a lot
of meetings about that.

284
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:16,472
I'll bet.

285
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:21,351
<i>For your free consultation
call Davis & Main at 505-242-7700.</i>

286
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:25,314
<i>That's 505-242-7700.</i>

287
00:18:28,984 --> 00:18:33,530
- Cliff signed off on this?
- The partners were very happy.

288
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:35,991
What do you think?

289
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:37,576
I think:

290
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:40,746
What ever happened to showmanship?

291
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:49,213
Yo, check it out. Ricola!

292
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:51,757
- Ricola!
- Hey.

293
00:18:51,924 --> 00:18:54,885
Why don't you two ass-clowns act
like the professionals...

294
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:56,804
...your parents are paying
for you to become.

295
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:01,934
- This happens to be very valuable.
- Yeah? What is it?

296
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:05,938
This one is the Alpine shepherd boy.
It's for her nephew.

297
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:09,733
So come on, join me.
Production meeting, bring it in.

298
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,862
All right, now look,
teamwork makes the dream work.

299
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:17,699
Together we can make something,
dare I say it, bravura.

300
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:20,202
This is a golden opportunity,
especially for you.

301
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:23,789
This will play all around the Southwest,
so who knows what it can lead to.

302
00:19:23,956 --> 00:19:25,707
Better lead to a hundred bucks each.

303
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:28,627
- What is it with you and money?
- Saving up for a VX2000.

304
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:32,881
Hey, pop quiz. What do we three have
in common with the greats?

305
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:36,134
Welles, Fellini, Bergman, the biggies.

306
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:37,511
What?

307
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:39,137
All three of them, to a man...

308
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:43,517
...worked in the highly lucrative,
creatively-rewarding field of advertising.

309
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:48,313
And tonight we join them.
This is heady stuff, right?

310
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,732
Okay, so pay attention.

311
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:54,361
We open on Granny
and she is rocking.

312
00:19:54,528 --> 00:20:00,784
So, she's back and forth, just very--
Back and forth.

313
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:04,913
And then, very slowly and smoothly...

314
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:09,209
...the camera moves towards--

315
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:11,545
- Dolly.
- A dolly, good.

316
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:12,963
See a dolly here?

317
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:16,675
- You guys didn't bring a dolly?
- Nope, no dolly.

318
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:19,428
- You didn't ask for a dolly.
- Gotta ask. Dolly is extra.

319
00:20:19,595 --> 00:20:22,264
- That's true.
- Okay, no dolly.

320
00:20:22,431 --> 00:20:24,600
Um, heh.

321
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:26,768
We will improvise, then.

322
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:30,981
Stay with me.
She's rocking. She's shivering.

323
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:35,819
She's clutching...

324
00:20:35,986 --> 00:20:37,905
...at a tattered shawl.

325
00:20:39,615 --> 00:20:43,577
They turned the heat off on her,
these evil bastards.

326
00:20:43,744 --> 00:20:45,954
She's cold and hungry,
she's friendless.

327
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:50,250
This is heart-rending stuff, man.

328
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:55,213
Okay, it's a oner
and it's shot in glorious black and white.

329
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,799
- We can do that, right?
- Yeah.

330
00:20:59,635 --> 00:21:03,680
So, that's it, old lady in a chair?
That's your commercial?

331
00:21:05,349 --> 00:21:07,392
Does anybody like you?

332
00:21:09,478 --> 00:21:12,356
I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. McGill.

333
00:22:00,654 --> 00:22:02,614
<i>Makes the grab, two outs here.</i>

334
00:22:02,781 --> 00:22:05,117
<i>He got underneath that one.
I think it's....</i>

335
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:08,370
<i>An easy, easy pop fly
out to dead centre.</i>

336
00:22:08,537 --> 00:22:10,038
<i>That'll bring up....</i>

337
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:14,459
<i>Murphy's gone 13 for 29
over his last eight games...</i>

338
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:17,838
<i>...batting a blistering.343 overall.</i>

339
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:20,424
<i>And now Louis again
working quickly with the bench.</i>

340
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:24,094
<i>Murphy swings, it's a two-hopper
into the crowd, foul ball.</i>

341
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,402
Have a good one.

342
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:35,267
Hey, honey, what's happening?

343
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:37,185
What's wrong?

344
00:24:37,811 --> 00:24:39,688
What happened?

345
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:55,328
- Where's Kaylee?
- She's at school.

346
00:24:55,495 --> 00:24:58,623
- She's fine, she doesn't know about it.
- Are you all right?

347
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:00,709
Let me show you.

348
00:25:02,836 --> 00:25:05,338
It's up there.

349
00:25:05,505 --> 00:25:07,132
You see it?

350
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:09,092
It's right up there.

351
00:25:10,218 --> 00:25:12,679
You see that?
You see the shape of it?

352
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:17,058
- You do see it, right?
- Uh, I see it.

353
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:20,312
What time did you hear the shots?

354
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:23,064
2:13 this morning.
I looked at the clock.

355
00:25:23,231 --> 00:25:26,109
It was three of them.
It was exactly like last time.

356
00:25:26,276 --> 00:25:27,777
And you didn't call the police?

357
00:25:27,944 --> 00:25:30,572
No, I.... What's the point?

358
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:37,454
Uh, I'm thinking outside the box, but....

359
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:41,291
You think maybe it's possible
that you dreamed it?

360
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:42,542
It happens sometimes.

361
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:44,586
I didn't dream it, Mike.

362
00:25:44,753 --> 00:25:47,297
Because I didn't sleep a wink last night.

363
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:50,091
That came from a bullet.
I mean, it must have.

364
00:25:50,258 --> 00:25:52,510
It wasn't there before last night.
I promise you.

365
00:25:52,677 --> 00:25:54,930
- And I don't know--
- Okay.

366
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:56,681
Okay.

367
00:25:56,848 --> 00:25:58,725
Jesus.

368
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:01,895
I mean, I was here.
I was here and you weren't.

369
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:04,272
I believe you.

370
00:26:06,066 --> 00:26:08,151
I believe you.

371
00:26:12,155 --> 00:26:13,782
All right.

372
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:18,036
That's it. We're getting you
and Kaylee out of this house.

373
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:20,538
End of story.

374
00:26:42,143 --> 00:26:44,229
Do you ever wonder about these things?

375
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:47,857
- What things?
- This. Like what's the story with these?

376
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:53,113
Who was it who first said,
"Hey, I know, big bowl of balls"?

377
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,156
I don't know. They came with the place.

378
00:26:55,323 --> 00:26:59,327
No shit. They're in
every corporate apartment in the world.

379
00:26:59,494 --> 00:27:00,912
They're like the Gideon bible.

380
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:04,916
Hey. Don't be jealous of my
big bowl of balls. It's unbecoming.

381
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:07,544
Why do they all have
to have empty vases?

382
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:11,548
Well, it's the law. Plus it's a metaphor.

383
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:15,260
Gotta say, I will miss
the nail salon's vibrating chairs.

384
00:27:15,927 --> 00:27:18,847
Well, for you I can make
any chair in this place vibrate.

385
00:27:19,514 --> 00:27:21,349
You ready for this?

386
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:24,811
Okay. Here goes.

387
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:28,440
You're 86 years old, you're a resident
of Sandpiper, Colorado Springs.

388
00:27:28,606 --> 00:27:31,359
You just finished your afternoon snack,
lime Jell-O.

389
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:33,611
- Lime. Got it.
- You're in the day room.

390
00:27:33,778 --> 00:27:35,780
You're watching
your favourite TV programme.

391
00:27:35,947 --> 00:27:38,742
What's this? There's been another
murder in Cabot Cove?

392
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:40,035
- No.
- Yes.

393
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:41,703
The sheriff is in over his head.

394
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:45,081
Jessica Fletcher has to put aside
the novel she's been writing...

395
00:27:45,248 --> 00:27:47,125
...and assist law enforcement.

396
00:27:47,292 --> 00:27:49,753
Shocker,
the killer left behind a cryptogram...

397
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,589
...and commercial.

398
00:28:01,556 --> 00:28:05,352
<i>My husband and
I scrimped and saved for so many years.</i>

399
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:07,395
<i>We did our best
to build a nest egg...</i>

400
00:28:07,562 --> 00:28:10,523
<i>...so that we wouldn't be a burden
to our family.</i>

401
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:14,361
<i>After Ronald passed,
I moved to an assisted living facility.</i>

402
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:18,448
<i>A nice place. They told me
they'd take care of everything.</i>

403
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:22,494
<i>But, then one day
they said all my money was gone.</i>

404
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,829
<i>How could that be?</i>

405
00:28:24,996 --> 00:28:27,123
<i>Where did it all go?</i>

406
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:29,084
That's not a real tear?

407
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,418
<i>If you or a loved one
is a resident...</i>

408
00:28:30,585 --> 00:28:32,754
- Visine.
<i>- ...of the Sandpiper Crossing facility...</i>

409
00:28:32,921 --> 00:28:35,423
<i>...or other
associated retirement community...</i>

410
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,759
<i>...you may be eligible
to receive compensation.</i>

411
00:28:37,926 --> 00:28:41,971
<i>For a free consultation,
call the law offices of Davis & Main...</i>

412
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:44,891
<i>...at 505-242-7700.</i>

413
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:49,020
<i>That's 505-242-7700.</i>

414
00:28:52,732 --> 00:28:54,359
Well?

415
00:28:55,151 --> 00:28:58,321
You made that,
with some film students?

416
00:28:58,488 --> 00:28:59,989
I directed.

417
00:29:00,156 --> 00:29:03,785
It looks professional.

418
00:29:04,828 --> 00:29:07,330
- And?
- And if I were an 86-year-old...

419
00:29:07,497 --> 00:29:10,041
...Sandpiper resident...

420
00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:12,627
- ...I'd be dialling.
- Yes.

421
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:13,962
Up top.

422
00:29:14,129 --> 00:29:16,965
And all made in accordance
with the rules and regulations...

423
00:29:17,132 --> 00:29:19,717
...of the American Bar Association.

424
00:29:19,884 --> 00:29:21,386
Good.

425
00:29:25,473 --> 00:29:28,518
I can't believe
Davis & Main went for it.

426
00:29:28,685 --> 00:29:30,019
Well...

427
00:29:30,812 --> 00:29:33,773
- ...I'm in charge of the department.
- Yeah, but still, you know.

428
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,401
Cliff Main was fine with this.
Heh-heh.

429
00:29:36,734 --> 00:29:37,986
Why wouldn't he be?

430
00:29:38,153 --> 00:29:39,946
He.... No, it's....

431
00:29:40,113 --> 00:29:42,115
It's fantastic.

432
00:29:42,282 --> 00:29:44,784
Let's celebrate. I'm getting more wine.
You want some?

433
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:46,870
Absolutely.

434
00:30:29,996 --> 00:30:32,832
Thursday at 11
in the Conference Room? Okay.

435
00:30:51,684 --> 00:30:53,937
Very good. Thank you.

436
00:31:01,986 --> 00:31:04,322
Colorado Springs, Colorado. Yeah.

437
00:31:04,489 --> 00:31:08,660
I'd like the number
for KKTV channel 11.

438
00:31:09,577 --> 00:31:13,748
Omar! What's the cut-off for FedEx?
I need to get a package out, <i>tout de suite.</i>

439
00:31:14,624 --> 00:31:18,586
Oh. Yes, can you connect me
to your ad sales department?

440
00:31:18,753 --> 00:31:20,463
Thanks.

441
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:23,216
Gums look good. No recession.

442
00:31:23,383 --> 00:31:26,261
Tongue looks good too.
Eyes are clear.

443
00:31:26,427 --> 00:31:28,471
This little lady's in fine fettle.

444
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:32,016
- One of the girls can trim her nails.
- No, some other time.

445
00:31:34,352 --> 00:31:35,770
What do you got for me?

446
00:31:37,063 --> 00:31:39,107
Bodyguard job, 200 bucks.

447
00:31:39,357 --> 00:31:41,442
What else?

448
00:31:41,609 --> 00:31:44,529
For you,
that's the best fit I've got.

449
00:31:48,533 --> 00:31:50,451
I know a loan shark.

450
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:53,121
Always needs
enforcement and recovery.

451
00:31:53,288 --> 00:31:55,790
Pays good and it's steady work.

452
00:31:55,957 --> 00:31:58,209
Most of the time
we're just talking intimidation.

453
00:31:58,376 --> 00:32:01,963
- Strictly verbal.
- Most of the time.

454
00:32:02,213 --> 00:32:04,882
I'm not breaking legs. What else?

455
00:32:06,593 --> 00:32:08,136
Look.

456
00:32:08,386 --> 00:32:10,221
We discussed this.

457
00:32:10,388 --> 00:32:13,224
You want next-level pay,
you gotta do next-level work.

458
00:32:13,391 --> 00:32:15,476
I respect where you're coming from.

459
00:32:15,643 --> 00:32:18,771
I do. But that's just how it goes.

460
00:32:24,068 --> 00:32:25,361
All right.

461
00:32:25,528 --> 00:32:28,031
She's gonna need a DHPP shot.

462
00:32:28,197 --> 00:32:31,200
Six months.
We'll send you a reminder card.

463
00:32:31,367 --> 00:32:33,119
Till then.

464
00:32:34,078 --> 00:32:35,455
Give me the bodyguard job.

465
00:32:37,707 --> 00:32:38,750
For 200?

466
00:32:42,045 --> 00:32:44,380
Call you with the where and the when.

467
00:33:16,663 --> 00:33:18,706
Yes, sir. He's expecting your call.

468
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:23,503
- So, everybody knows--
- They know.

469
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:27,006
Every line starting with 7700
has been rerouted to the bullpen.

470
00:33:27,173 --> 00:33:29,759
Plus your office.
The assistants know to keep them open.

471
00:33:29,926 --> 00:33:32,428
So if you're on a call
and another call comes in...

472
00:33:32,637 --> 00:33:34,472
...it doesn't go to
an answering machine?

473
00:33:34,639 --> 00:33:37,225
Very important. Old people
don't like talking to robots.

474
00:33:37,392 --> 00:33:41,020
If I'm on a call and another call
comes in, it'll roll over to Maida.

475
00:33:41,187 --> 00:33:43,439
After that, Iris will get the next one.

476
00:33:43,606 --> 00:33:46,192
Then Julian and then Barbara
and Yvonne...

477
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:48,152
...right on down the line.

478
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:51,823
Good. Let's make that the plan then.

479
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:54,117
Oh, so, ahem....

480
00:33:54,951 --> 00:33:56,536
What time do you have?

481
00:33:56,703 --> 00:34:00,373
Quarter after.
It should be running now, right?

482
00:34:02,959 --> 00:34:05,294
Is there anything else?

483
00:34:06,045 --> 00:34:08,339
No. Thanks. It's--

484
00:34:08,506 --> 00:34:11,592
I'll just be in my office.

485
00:34:33,281 --> 00:34:35,032
Come on.

486
00:34:36,367 --> 00:34:39,871
Come on, Colorado Springs, come on.

487
00:35:00,475 --> 00:35:03,936
Good afternoon, Davis & Main,
attorneys at law, how may we help you?

488
00:35:04,562 --> 00:35:07,356
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am, that is unfortunate.

489
00:35:07,523 --> 00:35:09,025
Now, to get your case started...

490
00:35:09,192 --> 00:35:12,361
...may I ask for a name and a number
for one of our attorneys to reach you?

491
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,781
Good afternoon,
Davis & Main, attorneys at law.

492
00:35:14,947 --> 00:35:16,157
Can I help you? Yes, that is--

493
00:35:16,365 --> 00:35:17,950
Good afternoon, Davis & Main.

494
00:35:24,207 --> 00:35:27,585
Good afternoon, Davis & Main.
Sandpiper hotline, how may I help you?

495
00:35:29,712 --> 00:35:31,214
We'll get back to you.

496
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:34,342
Yes, ma'am. We'll be happy to send
an information packet to you.

497
00:35:34,509 --> 00:35:35,927
May I ask...

498
00:35:36,093 --> 00:35:39,180
...are you currently a resident
of the Sandpiper Crossing facility?

499
00:35:41,182 --> 00:35:43,059
Good afternoon, Davis & Main.

500
00:35:43,226 --> 00:35:46,646
- Bingo.
- Are you currently a resident at....

501
00:35:46,854 --> 00:35:50,316
I'll just need a name
and a phone number.

502
00:36:28,646 --> 00:36:29,981
Yeah.

503
00:36:30,147 --> 00:36:31,983
<i>Something came in this evening...</i>

504
00:36:32,149 --> 00:36:33,943
<i>...and it's definitely next-level pay.</i>

505
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,611
Yeah?

506
00:36:35,778 --> 00:36:38,155
<i>It's probably a long shot,
given your selectivity.</i>

507
00:36:39,323 --> 00:36:41,033
<i>What's the job?</i>

508
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,202
I asked. The guy wouldn't tell me.

509
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:48,124
But whatever it is, it's serious money.
And the guy?

510
00:36:49,292 --> 00:36:52,169
He specifically asked for you.

511
00:36:52,962 --> 00:36:55,298
And who's the guy?

512
00:36:55,923 --> 00:36:58,175
<i>- I can't hold it, sir.</i>
<i>- No control in the planes.</i>

513
00:36:58,342 --> 00:37:00,428
<i>We're going down and fast.</i>

514
00:37:00,595 --> 00:37:04,098
"We're going down and fast."
Check this out. This is the good part.

515
00:37:04,265 --> 00:37:06,893
<i>- Anything?</i>
- So do they all die? Tell me that much.

516
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:12,148
Does Rock Hudson run them
into an iceberg?

517
00:37:13,816 --> 00:37:17,236
Is this before or after
he did <i>McMillan & Wife?</i>

518
00:37:17,403 --> 00:37:20,072
Shut up, watch the movie.

519
00:37:22,825 --> 00:37:25,620
What is this weird fascination
you have with stories...

520
00:37:25,786 --> 00:37:28,581
...of men trapped on the North Pole?

521
00:37:28,748 --> 00:37:30,875
<i>Ice Station Zebra</i> is on the North Pole.

522
00:37:31,042 --> 00:37:34,670
<i>The Thing</i> takes place on the South Pole.
They could not be any more different.

523
00:37:34,837 --> 00:37:36,380
<i>- Aye, sir.</i>
- My dad loves this one.

524
00:37:36,547 --> 00:37:39,926
<i>- Put it in the red.</i>
- Yeah. Him and Howard Hughes.

525
00:37:40,092 --> 00:37:41,886
I know, right?

526
00:37:42,053 --> 00:37:44,430
Can't get two finer reviews than that.

527
00:37:44,597 --> 00:37:45,806
<i>How much pressure left in the air tanks?</i>

528
00:37:45,973 --> 00:37:48,476
<i>Down to 800 pounds, sir.</i>

529
00:37:48,643 --> 00:37:51,395
<i>- Secure aft to group below.</i>
<i>- Secure aft to group.</i>

530
00:37:55,816 --> 00:37:57,109
Unh-unh.

531
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:59,654
- It's the boss.
- At this hour?

532
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:04,200
Oh. It's never too late for congratulations.

533
00:38:06,577 --> 00:38:09,622
Cliff, Jesus, you're still at the office.

534
00:38:09,789 --> 00:38:12,249
<i>You ran a commercial?</i>

535
00:38:12,416 --> 00:38:16,087
Yeah, and oh, my God, let me tell you:
The response has been--

536
00:38:16,253 --> 00:38:17,296
<i>You ran a commercial...</i>

537
00:38:17,463 --> 00:38:20,299
...without showing it to me
and consulting me and my partners.

538
00:38:20,466 --> 00:38:22,593
Did you actually think
that was gonna fly?

539
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,096
<i>I was planning on telling you
in the morning.</i>

540
00:38:25,262 --> 00:38:27,556
- The day after it aired?
<i>- I only ran it once.</i>

541
00:38:27,723 --> 00:38:31,644
Just in one small market.
It was kind of an experiment, all right?

542
00:38:31,811 --> 00:38:34,313
Kind of under the radar.

543
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,275
And in all fairness, you did tell me
client outreach was my department.

544
00:38:38,442 --> 00:38:39,652
<i>Don't be disingenuous.</i>

545
00:38:39,819 --> 00:38:43,114
<i>This commercial,
I take it my firm's name is mentioned?</i>

546
00:38:44,323 --> 00:38:46,659
Yes. Yeah.

547
00:38:46,826 --> 00:38:49,328
Jesus. Howard said
you were a little eccentric...

548
00:38:49,495 --> 00:38:51,664
...he didn't tell me
you're a goddamn arsonist.

549
00:38:52,748 --> 00:38:55,960
Cliff, to be fair, I don't think, uh....

550
00:38:57,878 --> 00:39:01,757
I apologise if there was any misreading
of the situation on my part.

551
00:39:01,924 --> 00:39:04,010
But there's
a very positive headline here.

552
00:39:04,176 --> 00:39:07,138
We got 103 phone calls today...

553
00:39:07,304 --> 00:39:11,225
...off a measly $700 ad buy.
Now that kind of return on investment...

554
00:39:11,392 --> 00:39:13,894
- ...you can't--
<i>- Tomorrow morning, 8:00, my office...</i>

555
00:39:14,061 --> 00:39:16,147
...with the partners.
We wanna see this thing.

556
00:39:16,313 --> 00:39:19,525
Cliff, when you see this,
I know you'll--

557
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:25,906
Yeah, Cliff.

558
00:39:27,575 --> 00:39:28,993
Thank you.

559
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,661
Yeah, you too.

560
00:39:30,828 --> 00:39:33,122
Okay, see you.

561
00:39:34,707 --> 00:39:36,250
Golden boy.

562
00:39:37,126 --> 00:39:38,753
That's me.

563
00:39:44,133 --> 00:39:47,094
So what did I miss?
Anything blow up yet?

564
00:40:50,491 --> 00:40:52,743
Feeling cautious?

565
00:40:55,412 --> 00:40:58,040
You gonna tell me
what we're doing here?

566
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,585
- I've got a problem.
- Okay.

567
00:41:01,752 --> 00:41:04,839
This problem, I can't solve it myself.

568
00:41:05,005 --> 00:41:09,176
This problem, is it a who or a what?

569
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:13,430
There's a guy.

570
00:41:15,266 --> 00:41:18,185
I need him to go away.
