1
00:02:09,547 --> 00:02:10,882
- Howard.
- Morning.

2
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,843
- Delivery for McGill.
- What are you doing here?

3
00:02:14,052 --> 00:02:16,387
It's been a while.
I thought I should check on you.

4
00:02:16,554 --> 00:02:17,764
Did I hear music?

5
00:02:17,931 --> 00:02:22,435
Hm? No, no, I was just--
Let me get that for you. Yup.

6
00:02:28,358 --> 00:02:30,527
- Good to see you, Howard.
- Oh, likewise.

7
00:02:30,735 --> 00:02:33,112
You are sorely missed, my friend.

8
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:35,532
Don't take that as any undue pressure.

9
00:02:35,698 --> 00:02:41,454
Um.... I'm thinking of maybe coming in
for an hour or two next week.

10
00:02:41,663 --> 00:02:46,251
- Maybe kind of play it by ear.
- Well, if you feel comfortable.

11
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:51,422
I mean, we certainly would love to have
you. We will take anything we can get.

12
00:02:52,048 --> 00:02:53,633
I'll figure out a day...

13
00:02:53,842 --> 00:02:55,885
...and get Ernesto
to give you a heads up.

14
00:02:56,052 --> 00:02:57,887
That sounds great.

15
00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:04,894
- How's Ernie working out?
- He's been fine, for the most part.

16
00:03:05,061 --> 00:03:08,731
- Excellent.
- Everything on track with Sandpiper?

17
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,234
Moving along.

18
00:03:12,694 --> 00:03:16,573
Davis & Main
are really pulling their weight.

19
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:20,869
Well, they better. It's a complex case.

20
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:24,873
- Well, it's definitely not a two-man job.
- No.

21
00:03:25,415 --> 00:03:27,417
Anyone heard from Jimmy?

22
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:30,670
I have, yes. I've talked to him.

23
00:03:30,962 --> 00:03:32,505
How is he?

24
00:03:32,714 --> 00:03:36,342
He's fine. Doing well.

25
00:03:39,304 --> 00:03:43,516
Speaking of which, I have some news.

26
00:03:44,017 --> 00:03:46,352
He's working at Davis & Main.

27
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:50,106
Doing what?

28
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:55,987
Working as an attorney.

29
00:04:01,326 --> 00:04:03,661
- Clifford Main hired Jimmy?
- Mm-hm.

30
00:04:05,788 --> 00:04:10,043
To be fair, he had his doubts,
but he's giving Jimmy a chance.

31
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:12,295
He had his own people
doing client outreach...

32
00:04:12,462 --> 00:04:15,048
...but every time they'd talk to
a Sandpiper resident...

33
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:18,259
...Jimmy's name would come up. Yeah.

34
00:04:19,636 --> 00:04:21,429
- Those old folks just--
- They love him.

35
00:04:21,596 --> 00:04:23,014
Yeah, they do.

36
00:04:24,349 --> 00:04:27,769
Plus, I guess,
Cliff thought it would be a good idea...

37
00:04:27,936 --> 00:04:31,230
...for the case to have that sort of...

38
00:04:31,397 --> 00:04:34,984
...you know, continuity.

39
00:04:36,444 --> 00:04:39,948
- Jimmy certainly has a way with people.
- He does.

40
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:47,080
They're aware of his background
at Davis & Main? His education?

41
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:51,334
In the spirit of full disclosure,
Cliff did talk to me beforehand.

42
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:56,631
I didn't pull any punches.
I tried to paint a complete picture.

43
00:04:57,882 --> 00:04:59,300
But I didn't stand in the way.

44
00:04:59,968 --> 00:05:03,471
Of course not. Nor should you.

45
00:05:03,888 --> 00:05:05,807
Truth be told...

46
00:05:06,683 --> 00:05:08,893
...Kim Wexler pushed for this.

47
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,645
Hard.

48
00:05:11,896 --> 00:05:16,025
But I didn't, you know, stand in the way.

49
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:17,860
Partner track?

50
00:05:18,695 --> 00:05:21,322
I would, uh....

51
00:05:22,365 --> 00:05:25,910
Yeah, assume so.

52
00:05:28,454 --> 00:05:30,373
That's great.

53
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:34,210
- Good for Jimmy.
- Ha, ha, ha.

54
00:05:34,377 --> 00:05:36,004
- Charlie Hustle, right?
- Yup.

55
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:38,798
Yup.

56
00:05:39,632 --> 00:05:41,676
Well, I'll get out of your hair.

57
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:46,514
- Anything else to add to Ernie's list?
- No, all set. All good.

58
00:05:46,723 --> 00:05:48,933
- Thanks for coming by, Howard.
- Any time.

59
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,270
- You truly are missed. No pressure.
- Mm.

60
00:07:25,113 --> 00:07:26,697
<i>Document review...</i>

61
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:30,743
...will be coordinated through HHM.
To date, the following documents...

62
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:35,414
...have been requested from Sandpiper
as part of our initial discovery petition.

63
00:07:35,623 --> 00:07:37,500
One, resident lease agreements...

64
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:40,795
...past and present,
from all Sandpiper locations.

65
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:43,798
Two, invoices
and transaction documents...

66
00:07:43,965 --> 00:07:46,843
...from all supply companies
used by Sandpiper.

67
00:07:47,051 --> 00:07:51,722
Three, list of all past and present
official Sandpiper vendors.

68
00:07:51,931 --> 00:07:54,725
Four, any and all business agreements
and contracts...

69
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:58,062
...between Sandpiper and its distributors.

70
00:07:58,271 --> 00:08:02,525
Five, records of residents'
social security cheque receipts.

71
00:08:02,692 --> 00:08:06,028
Six, allowance transaction statements.

72
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:09,448
Seven, resident invoices
nonrelated to....

73
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:13,327
I'm loving the new look.

74
00:08:14,162 --> 00:08:15,371
How's Santa Fe?

75
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:17,248
It's, uh....

76
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,334
It's really....

77
00:08:20,543 --> 00:08:23,337
See? What'd I tell you?

78
00:08:23,713 --> 00:08:25,256
A nice place?

79
00:08:25,423 --> 00:08:29,343
The finest in temporary
corporate housing.

80
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,679
I can't wait to see it.

81
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:36,184
Maybe I should leave HHM
and get on that cushy D & M train.

82
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,061
It is very cushy.

83
00:08:39,604 --> 00:08:41,439
It's amazing.

84
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:48,237
Jimmy, I'm so happy for you.

85
00:08:49,113 --> 00:08:52,992
Thanks. You know,
things are really turning around.

86
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:57,455
I'm even thinking of looking,
you know, for my own place to buy.

87
00:08:57,663 --> 00:09:00,291
- In Santa Fe?
- I'm not sure yet.

88
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:03,169
Maybe someplace
closer to Albuquerque...

89
00:09:03,336 --> 00:09:05,379
...since I'm going
between the two so much.

90
00:09:05,755 --> 00:09:10,885
- Okay. So halfway points.
- Yeah, I was thinking--

91
00:09:11,052 --> 00:09:13,221
- Oh, wait, what about Corrales?
- Corrales, yeah.

92
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:16,098
Get a nice little bungalow,
or maybe not so little.

93
00:09:16,307 --> 00:09:17,308
Big open floor plan.

94
00:09:17,475 --> 00:09:20,686
I don't want any walls
disrupting my chi, yeah.

95
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:24,690
But I'm thinking I definitely want
some decent acreage.

96
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:27,693
- Get in touch with nature.
- Horses.

97
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,113
Come on, you could get horses.
Man, that would be so amazing.

98
00:09:31,322 --> 00:09:35,993
Too expensive. They-- All the oats, right?
It's oats that they're always eating.

99
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,287
- It's worth it.
- And the horseshoes.

100
00:09:38,496 --> 00:09:41,207
You have to get them shoes
and nail them with a hammer.

101
00:09:41,374 --> 00:09:43,876
It's totally worth it.
Long ride through the country...

102
00:09:44,043 --> 00:09:49,131
...and then a glass of wine
on the back patio at sunset.

103
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:54,387
Oh. We should get one of those smokers.
We could just barbecue for days.

104
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:59,725
Yeah, we definitely gotta get a smoker.

105
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,153
All right, well, I gotta go to the salon.

106
00:10:11,362 --> 00:10:14,448
They're delivering my new company car.

107
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:17,535
- Ugh. Are you serious?
- What?

108
00:10:18,953 --> 00:10:21,414
"Jeez, where's my solid gold blimp?

109
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,625
- No, not that one, the other one."
- Jealous.

110
00:10:26,002 --> 00:10:27,586
Totally.

111
00:10:29,255 --> 00:10:30,881
I forgot, I got you a present.
One sec.

112
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:47,273
Oh. That's a beautiful wrapping job.
It's a shame to open it.

113
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,025
It's a gift, be grateful.

114
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:56,449
Just keeping it real.

115
00:10:57,908 --> 00:11:01,787
Come on,
second is still very, very good.

116
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:03,873
All right.

117
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:14,175
Thanks. See you tonight?

118
00:11:15,134 --> 00:11:19,221
Maybe, if you play your cards right.

119
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,295
Hello, beautiful.

120
00:11:55,174 --> 00:11:56,634
What do you think, ladies?

121
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:01,555
Yeah, I know, right?
It's got all leather interior...

122
00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:05,309
...heated seats
for those cold desert mornings.

123
00:12:05,476 --> 00:12:07,937
This must be what heaven looks like.

124
00:12:17,113 --> 00:12:20,491
Hey. Goodbye hug?

125
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:22,410
No? All right.

126
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:26,831
We'll forgo the tears and just say
"till we meet again."

127
00:13:01,991 --> 00:13:04,243
Must be metric.

128
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:06,680
Hey.

129
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,979
What-- What are you doing here?

130
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:15,981
I work here.

131
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:18,901
Oh, small world.

132
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:23,948
So is this the parking lot
for the police station?

133
00:14:24,323 --> 00:14:27,701
- It is.
- You don't know if they validate, do you?

134
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:33,332
Why don't you pull around over there?

135
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:36,001
And we'll have a little talk.

136
00:14:36,335 --> 00:14:38,295
Uh, Okay.

137
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:56,605
Why are you here?

138
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:59,567
I have business with the police.

139
00:14:59,775 --> 00:15:01,986
And what business might that be?

140
00:15:02,194 --> 00:15:05,489
Well, if you must know, I was robbed.

141
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:08,284
Somebody broke into my house
and stole my property.

142
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:09,535
Your drugs?

143
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:12,413
Yeah, but obviously
I didn't tell the cops that.

144
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,456
I'm not stupid.

145
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:16,584
You've already spoken to them?

146
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:19,169
Well, a couple of them
came by my house.

147
00:15:19,378 --> 00:15:23,132
But it's not the drugs that I care about.
I mean, I care.

148
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,635
It's my baseball cards I need back.

149
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:30,347
Your baseball cards?

150
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:34,393
Yes. I have a very valuable
collection of baseball cards...

151
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,061
...and someone stole them.

152
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:39,523
I guess I shouldn't be surprised
I have to tell you this...

153
00:15:39,732 --> 00:15:43,611
...but it's probably a bad idea
that you willingly talked to the police...

154
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,070
...being a criminal and all.

155
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:49,325
I'm not here as a criminal.
I'm here as a crime victim.

156
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:54,413
Just because I occasionally
sell some pharmaceuticals...

157
00:15:54,622 --> 00:15:58,208
...I no longer have a right
to protection from crime?

158
00:15:58,417 --> 00:16:01,003
And I was very careful
when I talked to them.

159
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:05,174
I mean, they have no idea
about my other business.

160
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,136
If you already made your report,
why are you here?

161
00:16:09,345 --> 00:16:11,764
Well, they called me.
They have a few more questions.

162
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:15,976
They are very dedicated
to finding this thief.

163
00:16:16,644 --> 00:16:20,314
Since you're new to this,
let me explain it to you.

164
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:23,776
They've invited you on a fishing trip.

165
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:25,861
What's that, a fishing trip?

166
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:29,740
Those cops have no interest
in helping you get your cards back.

167
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:31,742
You're obviously under suspicion.

168
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,036
There was nothing there
for them to see.

169
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:36,830
I refer you
to our previous conversation...

170
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:40,918
...and this blinking neon sign
of a vehicle that says drug dealer.

171
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:43,671
They suspect you.
They will get you in there...

172
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:48,509
...pretend to be your friend,
lull you into a false sense of security...

173
00:16:48,676 --> 00:16:51,679
...and then they will sweat you.

174
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:53,555
And you will break.

175
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:56,016
I don't....

176
00:16:56,225 --> 00:17:00,479
- I disagree.
- Not open for debate. You go home now.

177
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:03,482
- But I have an appointment.
- Break it.

178
00:17:03,691 --> 00:17:05,776
And if they call you,
do not answer the phone.

179
00:17:05,943 --> 00:17:07,611
But what about my baseball cards?

180
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:09,530
- Cost of doing business.
- No!

181
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:14,827
No, no, no! I am getting those back.
I will take the risk.

182
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:16,286
No, you won't.

183
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:19,540
Because then you'll be
putting my well-being at risk.

184
00:17:19,707 --> 00:17:21,125
I have to.

185
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,377
I-- I--

186
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:26,964
Those cards...

187
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:30,008
...some of them were my dad's.

188
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:34,304
I am getting them back.

189
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:37,182
I'm getting them back.

190
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:49,445
I'll find your cards.

191
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:56,201
Is-- Is that something you do?

192
00:17:57,995 --> 00:18:01,665
Wow, that's-- That is so generous of you.

193
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:04,126
Oh, it'll cost you.

194
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:07,421
Oh.

195
00:18:08,172 --> 00:18:12,176
Okay, we should discuss...

196
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:17,556
...some sort of financial arrangement,
in which I-- I--

197
00:18:18,432 --> 00:18:20,100
Uh....

198
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:26,023
Okay, then. Jesus.

199
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:18,283
Davis & Main, this is Maida.

200
00:19:58,574 --> 00:20:01,493
- Come on in.
- I didn't mean to interrupt.

201
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:04,121
Not at all,
I was just blowing off some steam.

202
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:08,709
- You sound good.
- Thank you. Clears the head. You play?

203
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:10,669
Oh, I tried to learn in high school...

204
00:20:10,836 --> 00:20:14,214
...but then I decided
there were easier ways to get girls.

205
00:20:14,965 --> 00:20:18,135
I hope you've got a way to decompress.
Everybody needs something.

206
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:20,888
- How are you settling in?
- Great.

207
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:24,808
It's-- It's quite a step up for me.

208
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:26,894
Well, we're happy to have you.

209
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,188
Just let us know if there's anything else
you need, Jimmy.

210
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:36,028
- Thanks, Cliff, I'm happy to be here.
- Great.

211
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:41,992
- Better get back to it.
- Yeah, me too, I suppose.

212
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,410
Um....

213
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:45,913
Actually, I might have found something...

214
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:49,082
- ...in the initial disclosures.
- Oh, yeah?

215
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:52,836
Schweikart and Cokely keep referring
to the optional allowance programme.

216
00:20:53,045 --> 00:20:55,005
I checked a number
of residents' contracts.

217
00:20:55,172 --> 00:20:56,715
Not a single one has opted out...

218
00:20:56,882 --> 00:21:00,385
...which makes me think it's more
of a mandatory financial arrangement.

219
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:04,056
You think that's a failure to state a claim
that they filed in their answer?

220
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:07,684
They keep saying it's optional,
thereby voluntary. We can counter that...

221
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:10,103
...if opting in
is a requirement for residency...

222
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:15,067
...which it sure seems to be, well,
their voluntary claims don't hold water.

223
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:20,155
Might be onto something here.

224
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:22,783
Nice work, Jimmy.

225
00:21:24,618 --> 00:21:26,578
Thanks, Cliff.

226
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:46,556
Welcome. How can I help you?

227
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:50,352
I was hoping to get an estimate,
<i>mi</i> car.

228
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:54,022
- You do cars?
<i>- Sí,</i> cars, <i>todo el tiempo.</i>

229
00:21:54,231 --> 00:21:56,942
I was hoping
to get my seats reupholstered.

230
00:21:58,068 --> 00:21:59,695
Um....

231
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:01,947
Take a look?

232
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:46,783
Yeah, I'm thinking something new.

233
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:50,287
Give the old girl a little love.

234
00:22:50,954 --> 00:22:52,664
I'm happy for the work...

235
00:22:52,831 --> 00:22:57,294
...but his money might be better spent
on a down payment for a new car.

236
00:22:57,461 --> 00:22:59,880
He said you should save your money
and get a new car.

237
00:23:00,047 --> 00:23:03,300
Yeah? Well, it has a sentimental value.

238
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:10,766
- Classic car.
- Mm.

239
00:23:12,601 --> 00:23:14,311
What's he looking for?

240
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:16,271
What material do you want?

241
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:20,317
Well, I was thinking leather, definitely.

242
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:22,611
Maybe alligator.

243
00:23:26,156 --> 00:23:28,784
Oh, señor, too much money.

244
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:32,287
But like I said,
it has a sentimental value.

245
00:23:38,043 --> 00:23:42,005
I think an exotic leather would clash.

246
00:23:42,255 --> 00:23:46,009
Maybe something a little more
consistent with the style of the car.

247
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:47,469
Convince him.

248
00:23:47,636 --> 00:23:51,181
He says alligator's
gonna look all wrong.

249
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:53,558
Cheaper might be better.

250
00:23:53,725 --> 00:23:57,062
Well, show me what you'd pick.

251
00:23:57,229 --> 00:23:58,688
Uh....

252
00:24:02,567 --> 00:24:04,194
I'm sorry, señor.

253
00:24:04,361 --> 00:24:06,905
My son, he will help you.

254
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:08,448
Okay?

255
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:10,909
Help him pick.

256
00:24:11,118 --> 00:24:13,787
And don't try to upsell him, okay?

257
00:24:15,205 --> 00:24:16,456
Yeah, <i>mucho gusto.</i>

258
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:37,644
How'd you find me?

259
00:24:44,943 --> 00:24:48,363
- Why are you here?
- Baseball cards.

260
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:52,325
The way I figure,
you saw that midlife crisis of a vehicle...

261
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:54,661
...and wisely decided
to cut ties with the man.

262
00:24:54,828 --> 00:24:56,788
And I don't blame you, I did too.

263
00:24:56,997 --> 00:24:58,623
And then you ripped him off.

264
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:02,085
I'm sure those baseball cards
looked like an easy way...

265
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:06,214
...to make a few extra bucks off that idiot,
teach him a lesson too.

266
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:10,051
But you underestimated just
how big an idiot you were dealing with.

267
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:14,181
- No, I'm pretty aware.
- Well, then, you underestimated...

268
00:25:14,347 --> 00:25:16,308
...how attached the man was
to those cards.

269
00:25:16,683 --> 00:25:20,687
So attached, he called the police
and reported them stolen.

270
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,647
Now they're nosing around.

271
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:27,110
That sounds like a you problem.

272
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:29,029
It's very much an us problem.

273
00:25:29,196 --> 00:25:31,489
Yeah, I guess I'll just have
to take my chances...

274
00:25:31,698 --> 00:25:33,408
...but good luck to you.

275
00:25:33,617 --> 00:25:37,412
You know, I was hoping you'd see
our dilemma and do the right thing.

276
00:25:37,621 --> 00:25:41,917
But I think what we have here now
is a carrot-and-stick situation.

277
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:44,252
Oh, yeah?

278
00:25:45,212 --> 00:25:48,006
This the stick? Hmm?

279
00:25:49,007 --> 00:25:51,426
You coming here
threatening my family?

280
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:52,886
Huh?

281
00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:55,972
Because you're gonna need
a bigger stick, old man.

282
00:26:01,311 --> 00:26:04,022
I'm not here to threaten your family.

283
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:08,777
And the name of the stick
is Tuco Salamanca.

284
00:26:09,903 --> 00:26:13,490
Now, you don't play ball, so to speak...

285
00:26:13,657 --> 00:26:17,535
...and Tuco finds out
about your little side business.

286
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:20,830
That a big enough stick?

287
00:26:22,707 --> 00:26:26,670
However, I'd prefer the carrot.

288
00:26:26,836 --> 00:26:29,214
I think you will too.

289
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,217
And what would that be?

290
00:26:33,969 --> 00:26:38,348
You give me back the baseball cards,
10,000 in cash...

291
00:26:38,515 --> 00:26:41,476
...and you net roughly...

292
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:44,980
...roughly 60,000.

293
00:26:48,358 --> 00:26:51,403
And how exactly does that work?

294
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,202
Ernesto?

295
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,918
Hey.

296
00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:52,630
Going somewhere?

297
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:54,924
Yes, we are.

298
00:27:56,426 --> 00:27:59,804
She's a little tricky around the corners.

299
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,767
So-- And you gotta go
with the premium gas.

300
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:08,021
I know it seems like a scam,
but it makes a huge difference.

301
00:28:08,229 --> 00:28:10,899
And I would get her washed
at least once a week...

302
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:12,609
...and spring for the hand wax.

303
00:28:12,817 --> 00:28:17,113
You're gonna want that
extra layer of protection for the clearcoat.

304
00:28:19,866 --> 00:28:21,993
She deserves the best.

305
00:28:22,786 --> 00:28:25,830
I'll make sure the boys at the chop shop
are real gentle with her.

306
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:31,920
Wait, why?

307
00:28:32,754 --> 00:28:34,506
No.

308
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:37,842
You think I'd be caught dead
driving that thing?

309
00:28:38,051 --> 00:28:40,720
It looks like a school bus
for 6-year-old pimps.

310
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:43,306
All right, shall we move this along?

311
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:16,965
Aaron.

312
00:29:18,675 --> 00:29:19,968
Okay, there's Jeter.

313
00:29:21,219 --> 00:29:23,930
All right, okay.

314
00:29:31,271 --> 00:29:33,273
Mantle. Mantle. There's Mantle.

315
00:29:33,565 --> 00:29:37,485
- We good?
- Yeah, that looks like everyone.

316
00:29:37,694 --> 00:29:40,530
Yeah, they're here.
Looks like everyone's here.

317
00:29:46,911 --> 00:29:49,289
And now the other item.

318
00:30:06,014 --> 00:30:09,934
Now our business is concluded.

319
00:30:57,023 --> 00:31:00,693
You know, I can't help thinking
an apology was in order.

320
00:31:02,737 --> 00:31:05,698
It's-- It's the police again.

321
00:31:09,285 --> 00:31:11,704
Sandpiper hasn't responded
to our discovery requests.

322
00:31:11,913 --> 00:31:13,289
They buried us in paperwork...

323
00:31:13,456 --> 00:31:16,125
...but nothing relevant
to the particulars in this case.

324
00:31:16,334 --> 00:31:17,961
No real surprise there.

325
00:31:18,127 --> 00:31:20,880
We may have to subpoena
their bank records. Thank you, Erin.

326
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:23,925
Jimmy. How are we doing
with client outreach?

327
00:31:24,092 --> 00:31:25,927
While we're waiting
on those subpoenas...

328
00:31:26,094 --> 00:31:29,556
...we should try wrangling some
of this stuff from the clients themselves.

329
00:31:29,722 --> 00:31:32,559
I mean, most of these folks
have hard copies of everything...

330
00:31:32,725 --> 00:31:35,270
...going back to
the Eisenhower administration.

331
00:31:35,436 --> 00:31:41,067
Of course, given some of their
inconsistent organisational practices...

332
00:31:41,234 --> 00:31:42,652
...it's gonna be slow going.

333
00:31:44,946 --> 00:31:46,155
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

334
00:31:46,364 --> 00:31:47,574
Oh, this one lady, um....

335
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,661
She's sweet, but deaf as a doornail.

336
00:31:51,828 --> 00:31:54,372
She keeps all of her paperwork in--

337
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:56,833
- She keeps it--
- I'm sorry, excuse me, Jimmy.

338
00:31:57,041 --> 00:32:00,670
I'm gonna need everybody's phone,
key fobs and electronics.

339
00:32:33,995 --> 00:32:36,205
Chuck. Welcome.

340
00:32:36,372 --> 00:32:38,207
Please, have a seat.

341
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:40,627
Don't mind me.

342
00:32:40,835 --> 00:32:42,503
Hey, everybody.

343
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:52,555
I'm sorry for the interruption.
Just pretend I'm not here.

344
00:32:52,764 --> 00:32:54,390
Happy to have you.

345
00:32:55,475 --> 00:32:57,352
Jimmy, where were we?

346
00:32:57,518 --> 00:32:59,937
Uh.... Yeah.

347
00:33:00,396 --> 00:33:02,523
So I was saying....

348
00:33:04,108 --> 00:33:05,777
Um....

349
00:33:08,363 --> 00:33:12,784
Getting documents
from some of the clients....

350
00:33:16,454 --> 00:33:19,624
We definitely have some pack rats,
God bless them.

351
00:33:19,832 --> 00:33:23,461
I was visiting Mrs. Gusdorff
at the Sandpiper Santa Fe...

352
00:33:23,878 --> 00:33:26,214
...and I spent the whole afternoon...

353
00:33:26,381 --> 00:33:29,384
...sorting through
just a haystack of recipes...

354
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:31,386
...and half-off coupons for Big Lots.

355
00:33:31,552 --> 00:33:35,348
But now we've got copies
of this woman's monthly statements...

356
00:33:35,515 --> 00:33:38,810
...going back to March, 1997, so....

357
00:33:38,976 --> 00:33:40,812
It might be a little labour-intensive...

358
00:33:40,978 --> 00:33:45,066
...but our clients will always be
our best resource.

359
00:33:45,274 --> 00:33:47,151
Plus, they have ribbon candy.

360
00:33:58,162 --> 00:33:59,747
Jimmy.

361
00:34:00,331 --> 00:34:02,083
Hello?

362
00:34:09,298 --> 00:34:10,717
What are you doing here?

363
00:34:11,217 --> 00:34:13,678
My name is on the building.

364
00:34:14,721 --> 00:34:18,891
So great to have you here.
If you need anything, I'll be in my office.

365
00:34:25,481 --> 00:34:27,608
Why are you here?

366
00:34:29,277 --> 00:34:31,529
To bear witness.

367
00:34:43,374 --> 00:34:44,751
James McGill.

368
00:34:44,959 --> 00:34:46,836
It's Ehrmantraut.

369
00:34:47,003 --> 00:34:49,046
Are you still morally flexible?

370
00:34:50,214 --> 00:34:52,842
If so, I might have a job for you.

371
00:34:54,802 --> 00:34:57,096
Where and when?

372
00:35:04,687 --> 00:35:06,439
Take a seat.

373
00:35:09,442 --> 00:35:12,111
Mr. Wormald,
thank you for coming in and talking to us.

374
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,321
Yeah, of course.

375
00:35:13,488 --> 00:35:16,574
We've been looking at the reports
the officers took at the scene...

376
00:35:16,741 --> 00:35:19,577
...and we have a few
small follow-up questions.

377
00:35:19,744 --> 00:35:21,829
Sorry to waste your time.
Just standard stuff.

378
00:35:21,996 --> 00:35:23,831
There's really no need
for a lawyer here.

379
00:35:23,998 --> 00:35:26,501
I'm here in more of
an advisory capacity.

380
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:29,712
Dan just wanted a friendly face
next to him.

381
00:35:29,879 --> 00:35:32,256
Well, we're all friendly here.

382
00:35:32,423 --> 00:35:35,218
Look at us. Four friends.

383
00:35:35,384 --> 00:35:39,931
We just wanna get the facts straight so
we can help you get your property for you.

384
00:35:40,097 --> 00:35:45,019
Yeah, you know, it's fine.
Yeah, there's no need to....

385
00:35:45,186 --> 00:35:47,021
No, it's just standard procedure.

386
00:35:47,188 --> 00:35:50,942
You know, officers don't always get
all the information we need in their report.

387
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:53,820
We just wanna find the guys
who took your baseball cards.

388
00:35:54,028 --> 00:35:56,322
Yeah, that's, uh....

389
00:35:56,489 --> 00:35:59,742
You know, my uncle had
a Ty Cobb tobacco card.

390
00:35:59,909 --> 00:36:02,203
Kept that thing
behind 6 inches of glass.

391
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:05,873
- Like it was the <i>Mona Lisa</i> or something.
- Wow, Ty Cobb?

392
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,793
Tell him to keep the lights low.
Even artificial lighting...

393
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,380
...has a certain amount
of ultraviolet radiation...

394
00:36:12,547 --> 00:36:16,050
...that can, you know,
over the long term--

395
00:36:16,217 --> 00:36:18,761
Yeah, can you just remind us...

396
00:36:18,928 --> 00:36:22,014
...exactly where you kept your cards
in the house?

397
00:36:22,223 --> 00:36:26,769
Yeah, well, as I was trying to say,
it's no longer an issue.

398
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:29,146
I found them.

399
00:36:29,814 --> 00:36:32,692
- So you found the cards?
- Yup.

400
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:37,738
I just wanted to come down and tell you,
you know, in person.

401
00:36:37,947 --> 00:36:39,574
You found them?

402
00:36:39,949 --> 00:36:41,242
Where? Around the house?

403
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:44,787
No. I hired a private investigator...

404
00:36:44,954 --> 00:36:48,165
...and he tracked them down.
So, yeah.

405
00:36:48,374 --> 00:36:51,711
Really? So where were they?

406
00:36:52,211 --> 00:36:53,921
You know, it's fine. It is.

407
00:36:54,088 --> 00:36:57,508
I really--
I ought to get out of your hair.

408
00:36:57,675 --> 00:37:02,513
- You've wasted enough time on me.
- No, no. It's-- It's okay. It's our job.

409
00:37:02,805 --> 00:37:06,601
We just wanna get the facts right
so we can help close this case for you.

410
00:37:06,809 --> 00:37:08,561
It's done.

411
00:37:09,395 --> 00:37:11,272
Case closed.

412
00:37:11,689 --> 00:37:15,276
I just-- I know how much, you know,
you guys have on your hands.

413
00:37:15,443 --> 00:37:17,987
Like murderers, and robbers...

414
00:37:18,154 --> 00:37:22,325
- ...and gangs and stuff. I--
- Danny, why don't you get some air?

415
00:37:22,533 --> 00:37:26,162
You can have some coffee.
I'll finish up with the detectives here.

416
00:37:34,003 --> 00:37:37,256
Okay, let's get down
to brass tacks here, guys.

417
00:37:37,423 --> 00:37:40,217
I'm guessing your
two fine uniformed officers...

418
00:37:40,384 --> 00:37:43,471
...found Mr. Wormald's little hidey-hole,
and that's why you two...

419
00:37:43,638 --> 00:37:46,182
...are so interested
in "helping" my friend here.

420
00:37:46,349 --> 00:37:47,725
I get it.

421
00:37:47,975 --> 00:37:51,228
A hiding place in the baseboard,
it's gonna make anyone suspicious.

422
00:37:51,395 --> 00:37:55,483
But let me assure you,
there's nothing illegal going on here.

423
00:37:55,691 --> 00:37:56,943
Then why is he so nervous?

424
00:37:57,109 --> 00:37:59,779
Because I must say,
the flop sweat is kind of suspect.

425
00:37:59,987 --> 00:38:02,448
We all have our secrets, don't we?

426
00:38:03,032 --> 00:38:05,409
And who among us is without sin?

427
00:38:05,576 --> 00:38:08,829
But those sins
aren't all of the criminal variety...

428
00:38:08,996 --> 00:38:11,749
...and neither are Mr. Wormald's, okay?

429
00:38:11,916 --> 00:38:14,085
They are, however, very private.

430
00:38:14,293 --> 00:38:17,964
- Private like drug dealer maybe?
- No, no.

431
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:20,508
He's being evasive
because it's a sensitive subject.

432
00:38:20,675 --> 00:38:24,553
It's very delicate
and of no concern to law enforcement.

433
00:38:24,762 --> 00:38:27,682
You know, as much as we'd love
to take your word for it...

434
00:38:27,848 --> 00:38:29,642
...we'll need a little more than that.

435
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:33,980
All right, well, this all comes down
to a personal dispute.

436
00:38:34,146 --> 00:38:39,694
That's all. It's between
Mr. Wormald and...

437
00:38:40,528 --> 00:38:43,322
...his art patron.

438
00:38:44,365 --> 00:38:45,366
Art patron?

439
00:38:45,574 --> 00:38:51,330
Yeah, my client has an arrangement
with a wealthy gentleman...

440
00:38:51,497 --> 00:38:57,044
...for whom, ahem,
Mr. Wormald provides art...

441
00:38:57,294 --> 00:39:01,048
...in exchange
for this gentleman's generous....

442
00:39:01,799 --> 00:39:04,218
We'll call it patronage.

443
00:39:04,844 --> 00:39:07,430
Art. Like what, paintings?

444
00:39:07,805 --> 00:39:10,433
It's more like digital media.

445
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:12,518
Digital media?

446
00:39:12,685 --> 00:39:16,188
- He made videos for the man.
- What kind of videos?

447
00:39:16,355 --> 00:39:19,316
Private videos of an artistic nature.

448
00:39:19,525 --> 00:39:23,195
That's what was in the hiding place,
that's what it's for.

449
00:39:25,573 --> 00:39:30,453
So this art patron stole the videos
and the baseball cards?

450
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:34,623
Well, there was a misunderstanding.
I mean, call it creative differences.

451
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:37,585
Artists are volatile creatures.

452
00:39:39,295 --> 00:39:43,841
Guys, this all comes down
to just a lovers' spat. Okay?

453
00:39:44,008 --> 00:39:48,054
Two consenting adults had a falling out,
that happens...

454
00:39:48,262 --> 00:39:51,182
...and the patron stole the videos.

455
00:39:51,348 --> 00:39:54,018
And the baseball cards,
to make a point, I guess.

456
00:39:54,185 --> 00:39:58,647
But the headline here is
it's all settled, hearts have mended...

457
00:39:58,814 --> 00:40:02,735
...and Mr. Wormald
will not be pressing charges.

458
00:40:02,943 --> 00:40:05,404
What was on these videos?

459
00:40:06,447 --> 00:40:09,617
- They were private.
- You said that.

460
00:40:11,035 --> 00:40:14,497
They were videos intended...

461
00:40:14,663 --> 00:40:17,875
...to titillate the senses.

462
00:40:18,042 --> 00:40:22,338
- Okay, so porn.
- Not-- No. Not as such.

463
00:40:22,505 --> 00:40:27,343
Technically, they would be categorised
as fetish videos, but nothing illegal.

464
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:30,137
Just a man,
a fully clothed man, I might add...

465
00:40:30,304 --> 00:40:32,389
...just all by himself.

466
00:40:32,556 --> 00:40:37,269
Just-- Just Mr. Wormald, fully clothed.

467
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:40,314
- Yeah, so.
- Yeah.

468
00:40:40,481 --> 00:40:45,986
All right.
So fully clothed, Mr. Wormald...

469
00:40:46,153 --> 00:40:48,447
...by himself.

470
00:40:48,614 --> 00:40:50,825
- Doing what?
- Yeah, come on, man, what?

471
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:55,412
Squat cobbler.

472
00:40:57,706 --> 00:40:59,625
What's a squat cobbler?

473
00:40:59,834 --> 00:41:02,128
Squat cobbler.
You know what squat cobbler is.

474
00:41:02,336 --> 00:41:06,215
- No, I don't know what a squat cobbler is.
- No, me neither, what is it?

475
00:41:06,549 --> 00:41:08,384
What? You two guys are cops?

476
00:41:08,884 --> 00:41:11,595
Hoboken Squat Cobbler.

477
00:41:12,263 --> 00:41:14,515
Full Moon Moon Pie.

478
00:41:14,682 --> 00:41:16,684
Boston Cream Splat.

479
00:41:18,602 --> 00:41:19,603
Seriously?

480
00:41:19,812 --> 00:41:22,523
Simple Simon, the Ass Man.

481
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:23,732
Dutch Apple Ass.

482
00:41:23,941 --> 00:41:26,819
Guys, am I not speaking English here?

483
00:41:26,986 --> 00:41:30,614
- What the hell is a squat cobbler?
- It's when a man sits in pie.

484
00:41:30,781 --> 00:41:35,119
He sits in a pie and he--

485
00:41:35,369 --> 00:41:36,954
He wiggles around.

486
00:41:38,539 --> 00:41:40,374
Maybe it's like Hellmann's mayonnaise.

487
00:41:40,541 --> 00:41:43,210
It has a different name
west of the Rockies, I don't know.

488
00:41:43,419 --> 00:41:46,046
But technically
he does a crybaby squat...

489
00:41:46,213 --> 00:41:49,341
...so there's tears,
which makes it more specialised.

490
00:41:49,508 --> 00:41:53,304
Not all pie-sitters cry,
but I'm gonna tell you something.

491
00:41:53,512 --> 00:41:57,516
This guy, he's a regular Julianne Moore
once he gets the waterworks cranked up.

492
00:41:57,725 --> 00:41:59,435
Pies?

493
00:41:59,643 --> 00:42:02,688
- What, like apple?
- I'm not the filmmaker here, all right?

494
00:42:02,855 --> 00:42:06,775
Banana cream, I-- Peach.

495
00:42:06,942 --> 00:42:10,321
Oh, and there is a costume involved.

496
00:42:13,449 --> 00:42:15,326
You got to be shitting us.

497
00:42:15,534 --> 00:42:18,120
Yeah, like I would make this up.

498
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:23,709
Hey, the world is a rich tapestry,
my friends.

499
00:42:24,835 --> 00:42:25,878
But trust me on this...

500
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,881
...you don't wanna see it.

501
00:42:35,971 --> 00:42:38,849
So, uh, we're good, right?

502
00:42:39,016 --> 00:42:41,185
Yeah, great.

503
00:42:42,228 --> 00:42:44,939
There is, however,
one little, tiny hanging chad.

504
00:42:45,105 --> 00:42:49,485
- What chad?
- You're gonna have to make a video.

505
00:43:13,842 --> 00:43:17,596
Wait, wait.
So he eats the pies or just sits in them?

506
00:43:18,013 --> 00:43:21,725
- Both. Whatever you want.
- Which comes first?

507
00:43:21,892 --> 00:43:24,270
Oh. It's dealer's choice.

508
00:43:24,436 --> 00:43:27,523
- That's where the crying comes in, right?
- That's a safe bet.

509
00:43:29,483 --> 00:43:31,277
How the hell
did you come up with that?

510
00:43:31,443 --> 00:43:34,905
If you give me a million years,
I still would not have come up with that.

511
00:43:35,114 --> 00:43:37,449
The muse. She speaks through me.

512
00:43:37,616 --> 00:43:39,660
I am but a humble vessel.

513
00:43:39,868 --> 00:43:41,578
- And they bought it?
- Yeah.

514
00:43:41,745 --> 00:43:44,456
Wow, I've heard some far-out scenarios
used to sow doubt...

515
00:43:44,665 --> 00:43:48,168
- ...but this definitely takes the cake.
- Kim. Kim. Kim.

516
00:43:48,335 --> 00:43:49,545
- Takes the pie.
- Yeah.

517
00:43:49,712 --> 00:43:52,589
Sorry, I should just
jump off the roof right now.

518
00:43:52,798 --> 00:43:55,217
Yeah, you should feel bad about yourself.

519
00:43:55,384 --> 00:43:57,845
Jesus, can you tell a story.

520
00:43:58,262 --> 00:43:59,555
Well, to be fair...

521
00:43:59,722 --> 00:44:02,683
...I think it was the video that clinched it.

522
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:04,601
What video?

523
00:44:05,394 --> 00:44:07,563
Wait. Wait, you actually made a video?

524
00:44:07,771 --> 00:44:10,316
I gotta say, in the end,
old Dan really committed.

525
00:44:10,482 --> 00:44:12,901
I believed the tears.

526
00:44:13,736 --> 00:44:17,740
Oh. This is a leftover prop, it was extra.

527
00:44:17,948 --> 00:44:21,577
I wasn't sure how many takes
we would need so I overbought.

528
00:44:21,744 --> 00:44:25,289
But I promise you,
untouched by human buttocks.

529
00:44:26,373 --> 00:44:31,211
- You fabricated evidence?
- I made a video. Not exactly evidence.

530
00:44:31,378 --> 00:44:32,963
You used it to exonerate a client.

531
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:37,176
You used falsified evidence
to exonerate a client.

532
00:44:37,843 --> 00:44:41,096
- I think you're splitting hairs.
- I'm not splitting hairs.

533
00:44:41,305 --> 00:44:44,600
What if Davis & Main
find out you faked evidence?

534
00:44:44,767 --> 00:44:46,393
It wasn't a Davis & Main client.

535
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,104
It was some nothing
little pro bono thing.

536
00:44:49,313 --> 00:44:52,358
- It was off the clock, totally my own thing.
- Why?

537
00:44:54,777 --> 00:44:57,196
Why would you risk
the best job you've ever had...

538
00:44:57,363 --> 00:44:59,239
...for some pro bono case?

539
00:44:59,448 --> 00:45:01,033
I was doing a favour for a friend.

540
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,453
Risking disbarment? That's--
That's some friend.

541
00:45:04,661 --> 00:45:06,705
It's fine, it worked out.

542
00:45:06,872 --> 00:45:10,292
- Davis & Main are none the wiser.
- Jimmy, you're playing with fire here.

543
00:45:11,085 --> 00:45:12,544
I didn't see you complaining...

544
00:45:12,711 --> 00:45:16,256
...when Ken the douchebag
paid our bar bill the other night.

545
00:45:16,465 --> 00:45:18,884
That was a little bit
of rule-breaking right there...

546
00:45:19,051 --> 00:45:22,304
...and if I remember correctly,
you liked it, a lot.

547
00:45:22,471 --> 00:45:26,683
- That is so not the same thing.
- How? What's the difference?

548
00:45:26,892 --> 00:45:31,355
That had nothing to do with work,
and we were just screwing around.

549
00:45:31,522 --> 00:45:35,067
This, fabricating evidence--

550
00:45:35,234 --> 00:45:38,987
Jimmy, this could really hurt you
if they find out, if you get caught.

551
00:45:39,154 --> 00:45:41,073
- They're never gonna find out.
- Seriously?

552
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,283
You sound like
every dumb criminal out there.

553
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:46,620
If you keep this up, they will find out.

554
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:49,415
For what, Jimmy?

555
00:45:52,501 --> 00:45:54,586
What is the point?

556
00:46:10,686 --> 00:46:13,313
I cannot hear about this sort of thing...

557
00:46:14,481 --> 00:46:16,692
...ever again, okay?

558
00:46:20,988 --> 00:46:23,157
I mean it, Jimmy.

559
00:46:25,576 --> 00:46:27,244
You won't.
