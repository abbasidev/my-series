1
00:02:12,801 --> 00:02:16,513
<i>My husband and I
scrimped and saved for so many years.</i>

2
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:18,723
<i>We did our best to build a nest-egg...</i>

3
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,768
<i>...so that we wouldn't be
a burden to our family.</i>

4
00:02:21,935 --> 00:02:25,647
<i>After Ronald passed, I moved
to an assisted living facility.</i>

5
00:02:25,814 --> 00:02:27,398
<i>A nice place.</i>

6
00:02:27,565 --> 00:02:29,776
<i>They told me
they'd take care of everything...</i>

7
00:02:29,943 --> 00:02:33,655
<i>...but then one day they said
all my money was gone.</i>

8
00:02:33,822 --> 00:02:36,115
<i>How could that be?</i>

9
00:02:36,282 --> 00:02:38,117
<i>Where did it all go?</i>

10
00:02:38,284 --> 00:02:41,913
<i>If you or a loved one is a resident
of a Sandpiper Crossing facility...</i>

11
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,250
<i>- ...or associated retirement....</i>
- Jesus. You used your own voice?

12
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,168
Strictly to save money.

13
00:02:47,335 --> 00:02:49,045
- All in, the whole thing cost--
- Just.

14
00:02:49,212 --> 00:02:51,256
<i>Call the law offices
of Davis & Main...</i>

15
00:02:51,464 --> 00:02:54,008
<i>...at 505-242-7700.</i>

16
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:58,805
<i>That's 505-242-7700.</i>

17
00:03:00,682 --> 00:03:03,685
Production cost: $647, all in.

18
00:03:03,852 --> 00:03:07,772
The one single airing
was a $700 ad buy, so dirt cheap.

19
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:11,568
You think this is about money?
That's what this is about?

20
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:14,195
I'm just trying to offer
complete information here.

21
00:03:14,362 --> 00:03:18,533
Now, this one airing, it was an experiment
and as such, by any measure...

22
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,743
- ...a success.
- You keep saying experiment...

23
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,370
...like you're
the goddamn Wright Brothers.

24
00:03:22,537 --> 00:03:24,956
When were you going to tell us
about this experiment?

25
00:03:25,123 --> 00:03:26,624
Today. This morning.

26
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:30,420
I admit I got a little ahead of myself.
A little exuberant...

27
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:32,255
...and for that, I apologise.

28
00:03:32,422 --> 00:03:34,799
But the headline here is, I think...

29
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:38,636
...we've gotten nearly 200 phone calls
since this one airing.

30
00:03:38,803 --> 00:03:41,764
Cliff, since you and I spoke last night,
72 more.

31
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:44,934
You hear that? Right there.

32
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:47,854
- That's the sound of victory.
- Jimmy, stop selling.

33
00:03:48,021 --> 00:03:50,565
And don't act like
you don't see the problem here.

34
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:54,110
- I don't.
- You cut us out.

35
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,364
- You did an end run around us.
- Exuberance is no excuse.

36
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:00,658
Cliff....

37
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:04,454
Client outreach is my department.
You told me that day one.

38
00:04:04,621 --> 00:04:06,164
If you're in charge of payroll...

39
00:04:06,331 --> 00:04:09,000
...would I be okay with you giving
million dollar bonuses?

40
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:11,669
You and I did discuss the possibility
of a commercial.

41
00:04:11,836 --> 00:04:13,755
The possibility in the abstract...

42
00:04:13,922 --> 00:04:17,050
...for a grand total of 30 seconds
when I was halfway out the door.

43
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:21,137
I guess-- I thought I heard enthusiasm.
So I-- I took some initiative.

44
00:04:21,346 --> 00:04:24,015
Some? Wow.

45
00:04:24,682 --> 00:04:27,894
We are a team at Davis & Main.
This is a team approach.

46
00:04:28,144 --> 00:04:31,731
You coming as a solo practitioner,
I knew there's gonna be a learning curve.

47
00:04:31,898 --> 00:04:34,275
But if you simply can't fit in
as part of the team--

48
00:04:34,484 --> 00:04:36,527
I can fit in. I--
I fit in.

49
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:39,405
I am here to help you and HHM...

50
00:04:39,572 --> 00:04:42,033
...win Sandpiper.
That's all this was about.

51
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,702
Sandpiper's not what keeps the lights on
around here.

52
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:48,581
We have clients who wouldn't want
to be associated with this kind of-- This.

53
00:04:48,748 --> 00:04:50,917
Our image, our reputation...

54
00:04:51,084 --> 00:04:54,003
...is something we've been
carefully building for years.

55
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:59,425
It's worth far more than any one case.
Something like this could damage it.

56
00:05:00,176 --> 00:05:03,513
Suffice to say, there's not much love
for you in the room at the moment.

57
00:05:03,763 --> 00:05:07,350
The vote is currently 2-to-1 to fire you
for cause.

58
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:11,521
However...

59
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:13,606
...I believe in second chances.

60
00:05:13,773 --> 00:05:16,943
But know this is both strike one
and strike two.

61
00:05:17,318 --> 00:05:20,613
Going forward, you can expect
a great deal more scrutiny.

62
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:34,585
Yes, ma'am, let me take your number.

63
00:05:44,846 --> 00:05:47,598
Come on, come on.

64
00:05:49,934 --> 00:05:52,228
<i>Hello, you've
reached the voicemail of Kim Wexler.</i>

65
00:05:52,395 --> 00:05:55,732
<i>Please leave me a message and
I'll get back to you as soon as I can.</i>

66
00:05:56,024 --> 00:05:59,152
Hey, Kim, I need you to call me
as soon as you can, all right?

67
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:01,821
It's a time-sensitive thing, so, uh....

68
00:06:01,988 --> 00:06:06,868
<i>I mean, I may have, uh, just....</i>

69
00:06:07,035 --> 00:06:12,707
<i>Well, please call me
before you talk to Howard, okay? Bye.</i>

70
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,085
<i>It's a simple question, Kim.
Did you or did you not...</i>

71
00:06:16,252 --> 00:06:19,338
- ...know about this commercial?
- I-- Yes.

72
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:22,091
- He showed it to me--
- He showed it to you?

73
00:06:22,258 --> 00:06:26,179
- Yes. A few days ago.
- And you didn't say anything to anyone?

74
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:27,889
No. I didn't.

75
00:06:28,056 --> 00:06:31,976
- You didn't think I deserved a heads up?
- I didn't realise--

76
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:35,313
At the time,
I didn't think it was necessary.

77
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,981
You were wrong about that.

78
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:39,901
We were caught flat-footed
in front of our co-counsel.

79
00:06:40,068 --> 00:06:42,904
Which, I don't need to tell you,
does not reflect well on HHM.

80
00:06:43,071 --> 00:06:44,238
Or on you.

81
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:52,705
That'll be all.

82
00:06:53,164 --> 00:06:54,749
You can go.

83
00:07:17,605 --> 00:07:19,357
What are you going to do?

84
00:07:26,322 --> 00:07:28,324
So, what do you think?

85
00:07:30,493 --> 00:07:32,912
I figure from here,
you got a good bead on the place.

86
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:35,665
But someone inside,
they can't pick you out.

87
00:07:35,832 --> 00:07:39,335
Tuco and me, that's our spot.
He always sits facing out.

88
00:07:39,502 --> 00:07:42,839
Looks like a gangster thing,
but it's so he can keep an eye on his ride.

89
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:45,883
Every Tuesday, we're here
squaring accounts...

90
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,427
...dealer comes in, pays what he owes.

91
00:07:49,262 --> 00:07:51,639
Tuco, he likes to get face-to-face.

92
00:07:51,806 --> 00:07:53,975
Says everything he needs to know
is right here.

93
00:07:54,142 --> 00:07:57,395
Looks them in the eyes. Just stares.
Like he's looking inside of them.

94
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:01,566
I seen him go like that five, ten minutes.

95
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:05,486
And what does that accomplish?

96
00:08:06,404 --> 00:08:10,241
He calls it his lie detector.
That's why these things go all day.

97
00:08:10,408 --> 00:08:12,743
Just the two of you? No extra muscle?

98
00:08:12,952 --> 00:08:15,204
Don't need it.
We can handle our business.

99
00:08:15,371 --> 00:08:19,584
Anyway, it takes hours.
Collect the cash. Count it. Lie detector.

100
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,253
One at a time. Guy comes in,
transacts, then the next.

101
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:25,548
Then, when we're done,
Tuco gets in his car...

102
00:08:25,715 --> 00:08:28,426
...I get in mine, boom,
we go our separate ways.

103
00:08:28,593 --> 00:08:32,138
That is where you come in.

104
00:08:32,305 --> 00:08:34,974
See him packing up:
Drive over.

105
00:08:35,141 --> 00:08:39,729
Pull up in the spot next to Tuco's.
Pop, headshot, roll out.

106
00:08:39,896 --> 00:08:41,147
Easy.

107
00:08:41,314 --> 00:08:44,442
I-40 on ramp is eight blocks up.

108
00:08:44,609 --> 00:08:48,446
You're in the wind before anyone
has time to blink. And here's the beauty.

109
00:08:48,613 --> 00:08:51,199
All these dealers?
They know we're here.

110
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:52,533
So the story is...

111
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,120
...one of them got ideas, decided
to kill Tuco, get a cut of the business.

112
00:08:56,287 --> 00:08:59,790
Could've been any of them
as far as the cartel's concerned.

113
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:03,920
These Tuesdays of yours.
Day or night when you wrap it up?

114
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:07,131
- Day.
- So full daylight, plenty of traffic.

115
00:09:07,298 --> 00:09:10,134
How exactly do I not get seen?
My car, at least.

116
00:09:10,301 --> 00:09:12,803
Murphy's Law tells me
somebody's gonna pull the plate.

117
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,014
Fine. Go to the yard, buy a beater.

118
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:16,474
You gotta stay in the car.

119
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:20,436
Ain't no one gonna see you.
If they do see you, so what?

120
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:23,898
That's why you're perfect.
You're no one, you got no connections.

121
00:09:24,065 --> 00:09:25,524
- You're a ghost.
- Mm.

122
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:29,737
So I pull in next to him.
That assumes there's a parking spot.

123
00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:32,782
Our guys park next to him.
They come and go from the same spot.

124
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:34,450
Last one takes off, you're open.

125
00:09:34,617 --> 00:09:36,953
Someone comes in behind me,
I'm blocked.

126
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:41,040
- Who's gonna pull in behind you?
- I'm guessing someone who likes tacos.

127
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:43,876
What then? What's my exit?

128
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,964
I don't know. Get out and run.

129
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,173
Bad knees.

130
00:09:49,382 --> 00:09:52,593
Look. The details?
That's what I'm paying you for.

131
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,596
You got a better plan? Go on. Tell me.

132
00:09:55,763 --> 00:09:57,139
I'm all ears.

133
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,227
You sure about this?

134
00:10:02,061 --> 00:10:04,313
Killing your partner, heh...

135
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:08,359
...that's a bell you don't unring.

136
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:15,116
See this?

137
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:18,327
You know how I got this?

138
00:10:18,786 --> 00:10:21,080
Back in '96, '97,
Tuco and I were working...

139
00:10:21,247 --> 00:10:23,791
...with these bikers out
of Riverside County.

140
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,960
They were running
this peanut-butter crank.

141
00:10:26,127 --> 00:10:30,047
Real shit, you know, but cheap.
We could sell it as fast as we got it.

142
00:10:30,214 --> 00:10:32,758
Anyway, Tuco develops a taste for it...

143
00:10:32,925 --> 00:10:36,887
...and crank does not bring out the best
in people, made Tuco erratic.

144
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:40,683
Our connect was a guy
called Dog Paulson.

145
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:44,937
One day, Tuco's settling up with Dog,
he decides to put on his lie detector.

146
00:10:45,104 --> 00:10:46,981
Dog is like, "What the hell," you know.

147
00:10:47,148 --> 00:10:50,276
Tuco just keeps staring at him,
then he goes real quiet.

148
00:10:50,443 --> 00:10:51,944
"You think I'm an idiot, Dog?"

149
00:10:52,111 --> 00:10:54,113
He thinks Dog
is supplying his competitor...

150
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,656
...trying to cut Tuco out.

151
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:58,034
Dog, he denies it.

152
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:01,370
"No way, not me."

153
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:05,708
Tuco doesn't even raise his voice,
but suddenly he's got a sawed-off...

154
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:08,377
...and right in Dog's face.

155
00:11:08,544 --> 00:11:10,629
I was behind him.

156
00:11:12,048 --> 00:11:15,009
Sickest thing I ever saw to this day,
and this...

157
00:11:15,176 --> 00:11:19,347
...a piece of Dog's skull under the skin,
a little piece of him.

158
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:21,515
Tried digging it out,
but it's in there pretty good.

159
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:23,809
Not the kind of thing
you go to the doctors for.

160
00:11:23,976 --> 00:11:28,981
The thing about it
was Tuco really liked Dog.

161
00:11:29,148 --> 00:11:30,483
Kind of felt bad afterwards.

162
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:31,859
But when he's using:

163
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:35,780
<i>Loco,</i> crazy.
There's no other way to put it.

164
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:39,742
And he's using again, crystal,
much bigger kick.

165
00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:46,248
So it's like you said, if Tuco finds out
about my independent ventures...

166
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:49,293
...it's gonna be Dog all over again.

167
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:51,712
It's him or me.

168
00:12:05,768 --> 00:12:07,144
There.

169
00:12:09,105 --> 00:12:12,608
Man with a scoped rifle
could get a clean shot.

170
00:12:13,401 --> 00:12:17,029
Fire a single round, disappear before
anybody knew what had happened.

171
00:12:17,196 --> 00:12:19,907
No witnesses, clean egress.

172
00:12:20,408 --> 00:12:22,118
Pretty far.

173
00:12:23,661 --> 00:12:25,704
You can make that shot?

174
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:28,332
Yeah.

175
00:12:30,376 --> 00:12:32,461
You saying you'd do it?

176
00:12:35,214 --> 00:12:37,007
Fifty grand.

177
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:39,343
Fifty grand.

178
00:12:42,513 --> 00:12:44,723
I'll look into it.

179
00:13:11,417 --> 00:13:13,794
- Hey, uh....
- Your brother isn't here, Mr. McGill.

180
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:17,923
I know. He sent me to get his ink blotter.
I'll just be a second.

181
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:22,720
- Watch yourself, the floor is slick.
- Thank you, Gesualdo.

182
00:13:22,887 --> 00:13:25,222
Sorry about the floor.

183
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:33,939
Oh, no.

184
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:36,734
Are you looking for Miss Wexler?

185
00:13:36,901 --> 00:13:39,403
- Guess I'm too late, huh?
- No, she's still here.

186
00:13:39,737 --> 00:13:41,572
Where?

187
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:58,339
Kim.

188
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:04,929
I am so, so sorry.

189
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:10,518
- I should've told you last night.
- You think?

190
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:12,561
I honestly thought I could fix it.

191
00:14:12,728 --> 00:14:16,065
I thought they'd understand
once they saw the numbers.

192
00:14:16,232 --> 00:14:20,027
I knew it would work, and it did.
It worked.

193
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:26,033
Howard can't just stick you in Doc Review
because of something I did.

194
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,954
Plus, at an entirely different law firm.
What kind of sense does that make?

195
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,039
I told you this would happen.

196
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:35,543
- He can't blame you for this.
- I warned you he would.

197
00:14:37,545 --> 00:14:39,088
I'm talking to Howard.

198
00:14:39,255 --> 00:14:42,633
And what, call him a pig fucker again?
Yup, that'll help.

199
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:48,639
I screwed up, you know. I know that.

200
00:14:48,806 --> 00:14:53,978
But this, this is total BS.
I'm talking to him tonight.

201
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:57,231
- Jimmy, no. It'll only make things worse.
- I'll explain it to him.

202
00:14:57,398 --> 00:14:58,899
No.

203
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:02,695
I'm not asking you, I'm telling you.

204
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:05,781
If you go to Howard,
you and I, we're done.

205
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,996
So we're not done now?

206
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:16,208
I need this job.

207
00:15:17,793 --> 00:15:21,422
And there's a weekly billing quota
that I'm about 40 hours behind on...

208
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:24,300
...so could you please just go?

209
00:15:30,306 --> 00:15:32,016
I'm sorry.

210
00:16:20,064 --> 00:16:21,106
Chuck.

211
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:24,485
Chuck!

212
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,322
Come on!

213
00:16:29,448 --> 00:16:31,784
I'm not going away.

214
00:16:33,494 --> 00:16:35,996
All right, you asked for it.

215
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:43,712
I'm coming in.

216
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:57,059
Chuck?

217
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:05,693
Chuck.

218
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:13,117
Can you hear me?
Can you talk to me?

219
00:17:14,243 --> 00:17:19,498
- You want me to get you to the hospital?
- No. No hospitals.

220
00:17:19,665 --> 00:17:21,834
I'll be all right.

221
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:25,295
Get some water, please.

222
00:17:48,152 --> 00:17:50,571
Extra protection here.

223
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:07,671
Here. You know what? Sit up.

224
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:11,341
- Can you sit--?
- Ah, ah. All right.

225
00:18:13,302 --> 00:18:15,679
Okay, all right. Here.

226
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:26,273
Ah. Mm.

227
00:18:34,782 --> 00:18:36,241
Mm.

228
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:06,730
That's the Armalite AR-50.

229
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:10,859
State-of-the-art,
accurate to 2400 metres.

230
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:13,654
I got the Leupold Mark 4 on it now...

231
00:19:13,821 --> 00:19:16,615
...but I can always upgrade you
to a Schmidt & Bender.

232
00:19:16,782 --> 00:19:21,787
Single-shot, bolt.
Simple, effective, reliable.

233
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:26,124
It fires a.50 calibre BMG.
Very effective against soft targets...

234
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:30,546
...in light cover, behind cars,
small-diameter trees and such.

235
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:35,092
As always, I've gone to the trouble
of grinding down the serial number.

236
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,846
No, unless you ground the hole
clean through, acid will recover it.

237
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:41,974
Well, that would be true,
but I follow up with a pass...

238
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,351
...through a random
stipple machine press.

239
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:47,104
Hides the patterns and metal density.

240
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:51,400
Should throw off your X-ray diffraction
and some other higher-end methods.

241
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:54,361
Nothing's perfect, of course,
but this is close.

242
00:19:55,404 --> 00:19:59,283
Mm. Looks like a hernia
with a scope on it.

243
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:04,621
Thirty-four pounds, not including
your bipod, which adds some heft.

244
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:08,292
Too much gun.

245
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:11,545
For most applications,
I would tend to agree.

246
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,464
SR-25 Match rifle.

247
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:19,011
Eugene Stoner-designed semi-auto.
That's about 11 pounds there.

248
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:22,055
Not quite the range or the punch
of the AR-50...

249
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:26,351
...but you're talking about a.5 MOA
at well past a thousand metres.

250
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:30,105
- I've heard they're prone to jam.
- It's been known to happen in the field...

251
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:34,318
...but there's not a semi-auto built
can boast it never jams.

252
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:37,863
If that's a concern,
you ought to stick to bolts.

253
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:42,367
Good bolt-action rifle, if you jammed it,
I'd wager you were setting out to do so.

254
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:47,080
Which brings us to the M40.

255
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:49,875
Tried and true, battle-tested.

256
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:55,464
Essentially the same rifle used
by Marine snipers since 1966.

257
00:20:55,881 --> 00:21:01,136
It's light, accurate, good for soft targets
in the 8- to 1200-metre range.

258
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:06,850
You seem to know this one.

259
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:09,186
Oh, yeah.

260
00:21:09,353 --> 00:21:11,480
You could say that.

261
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:17,402
That's the A1 model. There's not much
change from the original.

262
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:21,490
Biggest difference is the stock.
It's fiberglass instead of wood.

263
00:21:21,657 --> 00:21:25,535
- They changed it over in 1970 or so.
- Good.

264
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:28,038
Wood warped like hell.

265
00:21:28,205 --> 00:21:31,124
You get it wet,
put it in the sun, gone.

266
00:21:33,085 --> 00:21:35,087
Somebody probably should have
figured that out...

267
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:37,881
...before they sent it into
a damn jungle.

268
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:41,218
Yeah. Probably.

269
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:52,187
If these aren't to your liking,
I could get my hands on a few more.

270
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,691
No. I've changed my mind.

271
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:57,985
Thank you.

272
00:21:58,235 --> 00:22:00,904
I don't need anything
at this time.

273
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:03,991
- For your trouble.
- No, it's no trouble.

274
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:06,451
I make my living
on repeat business.

275
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:09,454
When you need what I'm offering,
you know how to find me.

276
00:22:45,449 --> 00:22:47,576
You're still here.

277
00:22:47,868 --> 00:22:51,455
- Yeah, I'm still here.
- Hmm.

278
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:08,638
Did you get any sleep?

279
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:10,766
Some.

280
00:23:11,516 --> 00:23:13,060
Enough.

281
00:23:13,643 --> 00:23:15,187
How you feeling?

282
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:18,857
I could use some tea.

283
00:23:24,446 --> 00:23:26,073
Thanks.

284
00:23:42,714 --> 00:23:45,008
- You scared me last night.
- Yeah.

285
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:46,927
Happens sometimes.

286
00:23:47,636 --> 00:23:51,264
Sometimes I overdo it, that's all.
It passes.

287
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:56,228
Going into the office really takes it
out of you, doesn't it?

288
00:23:56,394 --> 00:23:58,772
If I stay too long, yeah.

289
00:23:59,231 --> 00:24:00,941
Guess it's hard not to stay.

290
00:24:01,108 --> 00:24:03,693
There's so many important things
for you to do there...

291
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,863
...like, you know,
stick it to Kim Wexler.

292
00:24:07,489 --> 00:24:09,658
What did I do to Kim Wexler?

293
00:24:09,825 --> 00:24:11,868
She's back in the cornfield,
isn't she?

294
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:13,995
I didn't do anything to Kim.

295
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:17,916
I mean, I was present, yes...

296
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:21,086
...but management of personnel,
those decisions are all Howard's.

297
00:24:21,545 --> 00:24:25,674
That is rich. Now, tell me, when Howard
was making his management decisions...

298
00:24:25,841 --> 00:24:28,885
...was he sitting on your knee,
with your arm up his ass?

299
00:24:29,052 --> 00:24:31,513
Hey, can he talk
while you drink a glass of water?

300
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,724
That's uncalled for.
And if Howard were my puppet...

301
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:37,853
...he certainly wouldn't have
recommended you to Davis & Main.

302
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:42,315
Actually, I'm sure it was Kim Wexler
who talked him into doing that.

303
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:45,235
- Hence his anger.
- Don't punish Kim.

304
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:48,947
If you're mad at me,
take it out on me.

305
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:54,286
I know you like to think the world
revolves around you...

306
00:24:54,452 --> 00:24:56,830
...but this has nothing
to do with you.

307
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:00,375
Kim had a responsibility to
Hamlin Hamlin McGill.

308
00:25:00,584 --> 00:25:02,752
She should have been looking out
for her firm's interests.

309
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:05,422
Not letting us know about you
was her mistake.

310
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:08,258
Oh, come on. You can't be
pissed off at her about this.

311
00:25:08,425 --> 00:25:11,052
I'm not. Howard is.

312
00:25:11,219 --> 00:25:14,514
- And why shouldn't he be?
- Because she didn't know.

313
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:18,268
She didn't know I was gonna
air the commercial.

314
00:25:18,435 --> 00:25:20,812
She didn't know I hadn't gotten
it approved. She--

315
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:22,772
She didn't know.

316
00:25:25,775 --> 00:25:27,903
- I see.
- She didn't know there was anything...

317
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:30,280
...she was supposed to tell Howard.

318
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:34,534
As far as she was concerned,
Cliff Main was already looped in.

319
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:37,162
You told her he was?

320
00:25:37,329 --> 00:25:40,498
I implied it. So it's on me.

321
00:25:40,665 --> 00:25:42,334
Not her.

322
00:25:46,254 --> 00:25:48,965
She didn't say anything to us
about that.

323
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:53,178
She wouldn't. No,
she wouldn't want to make me look bad.

324
00:25:53,345 --> 00:25:56,348
You have to admit this shows
a lack of judgement on her part.

325
00:25:56,514 --> 00:25:58,642
She knows you.
She should have known better.

326
00:25:58,808 --> 00:26:01,311
- You are such an asshole.
- Why?

327
00:26:01,478 --> 00:26:04,064
For pointing out her one mistake
was believing in you?

328
00:26:04,231 --> 00:26:07,067
Chrissake, can we get
some perspective here?

329
00:26:07,234 --> 00:26:10,528
It was a simple little commercial.
It aired once, that's all.

330
00:26:10,695 --> 00:26:13,823
Can I remind you, it worked?
It worked like a dream.

331
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:18,078
See, that's your problem, Jimmy.
Thinking the ends justify the means.

332
00:26:18,245 --> 00:26:20,956
And you're forever shocked
when it blows up in your face.

333
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:22,999
What did I do
that was so wrong?

334
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,543
You broke the rules.

335
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,837
You turned Kim
into your accessory.

336
00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:30,465
You embarrassed Howard, who--
God help him.

337
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:33,009
--inexplicably vouched for you
with Cliff Main.

338
00:26:33,176 --> 00:26:36,596
You made Cliff and his partners
look like schmucks. Shall I go on?

339
00:26:36,805 --> 00:26:41,017
How he hasn't fired you for this
positively mystifies me.

340
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:43,270
Perspective.

341
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:46,606
You want perspective?
I'll give you mine.

342
00:26:46,773 --> 00:26:49,859
You're my brother,
and I love you...

343
00:26:50,026 --> 00:26:54,114
...but you're like an alcoholic who
refuses to admit he's got a problem.

344
00:26:54,281 --> 00:26:56,366
Now someone's given you the keys
to the school bus...

345
00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:58,827
...and I'm not gonna let you
drive it off a cliff.

346
00:26:59,494 --> 00:27:01,454
Can we just get down
to brass tacks here?

347
00:27:01,621 --> 00:27:04,916
What can I do to put Kim back
where she belongs, huh?

348
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:07,794
You want me to quit Davis & Main?
That's fine!

349
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:09,921
I never wanted that job
in the first place.

350
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:13,675
I can't get through to you. Life is not
one big game of <i>Let's Make A Deal.</i>

351
00:27:13,842 --> 00:27:17,304
Yes, it is. I'm Monty Hall.
What's behind door number two?

352
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,472
What'll it take? Huh?

353
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:21,516
You want me to quit
being a lawyer?

354
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,979
Yeah. A chimp with a machine gun,
that's me, right?

355
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:30,317
Huh? So? What do you say?
You help Kim, I quit the law.

356
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:32,819
- Is that a deal?
- I didn't say that.

357
00:27:33,028 --> 00:27:35,572
You didn't say it,
but that's what you want, right?

358
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:38,867
That's why you put the screws to Kim,
to squeeze me!

359
00:27:39,034 --> 00:27:41,661
I didn't say that
and I would never say that.

360
00:27:41,828 --> 00:27:44,622
- Why not?
- Because if I were impeding the career...

361
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:49,127
...of one of my employees, compelling
you to do something against your will...

362
00:27:49,294 --> 00:27:52,756
- ...that would be extortion.
- Yeah. It would.

363
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:56,092
So? You gonna extort me, Chuck?

364
00:27:56,301 --> 00:27:59,721
It's a lead pipe cinch you'd get away
with it. I'm not gonna tell anyone.

365
00:27:59,888 --> 00:28:02,307
It's real easy.
You just set things right for Kim.

366
00:28:02,474 --> 00:28:05,352
You get her back in her office,
out of Doc Review, back to normal...

367
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:08,646
...and I quit the law for good.

368
00:28:08,813 --> 00:28:11,107
No more Jimmy McGill, Esquire. Poof.

369
00:28:11,274 --> 00:28:13,276
Like he never even existed.

370
00:28:13,443 --> 00:28:16,363
Wow. Wow.

371
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:18,990
But I need to hear the words
come out of your mouth.

372
00:28:19,157 --> 00:28:21,618
You're a man of your word.
You're an upstanding man, right?

373
00:28:21,785 --> 00:28:24,788
- God's sake, Jimmy.
- Come on, Chuck! Extort me!

374
00:28:24,954 --> 00:28:29,709
Say "quit" and I will quit, but I need
to hear it from your mouth.

375
00:28:29,918 --> 00:28:32,003
You want me to commit a felony.

376
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:34,672
Because that's
what you'd do, right?

377
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:37,425
You wanna believe that deep down,
I'm some hypocrite.

378
00:28:37,592 --> 00:28:40,178
Let's find out.
Come on down, Chuck...

379
00:28:40,345 --> 00:28:44,516
...roll around in the dirt with me.
All your dreams will come true!

380
00:28:44,682 --> 00:28:47,727
Go on, do it! Go on!

381
00:28:50,605 --> 00:28:52,857
I am not the bad guy here.

382
00:28:53,525 --> 00:28:57,487
If you don't wanna be a lawyer, that's
between you and the New Mexico Bar.

383
00:28:57,654 --> 00:28:59,531
If you wanna quit Davis & Main,
be my guest.

384
00:28:59,989 --> 00:29:02,283
You don't need help from me
to tank you career.

385
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,577
You're doing just fine
on your own.

386
00:29:06,204 --> 00:29:10,083
Speaking of which,
it's an hour's drive to Santa Fe.

387
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,918
Even if you leave right now...

388
00:29:12,085 --> 00:29:14,796
...you're still gonna be
at least 20 minutes late for work.

389
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:18,007
Another feather in your cap
with Clifford Main.

390
00:29:41,573 --> 00:29:42,907
So?

391
00:29:45,368 --> 00:29:47,287
I'm not gonna do it.

392
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:49,372
Are you negotiating now?

393
00:29:49,581 --> 00:29:52,041
No amount of money
makes this a good idea.

394
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:54,252
- For you.
- Look, man.

395
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:56,504
- I told you that I'm not--
- It's a bad move.

396
00:29:56,671 --> 00:30:00,383
- It doesn't solve your real problem.
- My real problem. What's that?

397
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:04,012
It's not Tuco.
It's keeping it secret.

398
00:30:05,805 --> 00:30:08,641
A dead Tuco draws
Salamancas like flies.

399
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:11,728
Cartel noses into the business.

400
00:30:11,936 --> 00:30:13,438
Looks for who hit one of theirs.

401
00:30:13,605 --> 00:30:15,982
You gonna be able to
keep your secrets then?

402
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,110
Something's gotta give.

403
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:22,614
With you, without you, I don't care.

404
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,824
But something's gonna happen.

405
00:30:25,033 --> 00:30:27,410
Hmm. Well, you said it yourself.

406
00:30:27,577 --> 00:30:30,246
You don't need him dead.
You need him to go away.

407
00:30:30,413 --> 00:30:32,373
You mean snitch?

408
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:36,294
Man, I drop a dime on Tuco,
who do you think the cartel looks at? Me.

409
00:30:36,461 --> 00:30:39,964
I call the cops, I get picked up too.
I'm what you call a "known associate."

410
00:30:40,131 --> 00:30:41,466
So I'm locked up with Tuco...

411
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:43,968
...who's looking for the guy
that put him there.

412
00:30:44,636 --> 00:30:47,972
- Tell me how that helps me.
- You won't have to talk to the cops.

413
00:30:48,139 --> 00:30:50,141
You won't have to do any time.

414
00:30:50,308 --> 00:30:53,728
There's no killing,
but your Tuco problem...

415
00:30:54,729 --> 00:30:56,856
...it goes away.

416
00:32:06,843 --> 00:32:08,928
- It's all there.
- Shh.

417
00:32:09,554 --> 00:32:11,889
Let the man count.

418
00:32:18,479 --> 00:32:19,981
We're good.

419
00:32:26,571 --> 00:32:28,281
So...

420
00:32:28,948 --> 00:32:30,658
...until next time, huh?

421
00:32:44,088 --> 00:32:45,590
Tuco.

422
00:32:59,812 --> 00:33:01,397
Okay.

423
00:33:01,898 --> 00:33:03,024
Go.

424
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,567
Okay.

425
00:33:07,362 --> 00:33:09,072
I'll see you next week, Tuco.

426
00:33:10,073 --> 00:33:13,076
- Nacho.
- Yeah, see you, Domingo.

427
00:33:16,621 --> 00:33:18,748
He's got good numbers.

428
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,833
He's hustling.

429
00:33:21,209 --> 00:33:22,919
What do you think?

430
00:33:24,295 --> 00:33:25,838
Solid?

431
00:33:56,994 --> 00:33:59,914
Yes, I would like to
report a fight going on...

432
00:34:00,081 --> 00:34:04,210
...at the El Michoacano restaurant on
the 5000 block of Isleta Boulevard.

433
00:34:04,377 --> 00:34:07,839
There is a man
threatening another man with a gun.

434
00:34:08,005 --> 00:34:11,050
It looks to be some sort of gang thing.

435
00:34:11,551 --> 00:34:13,177
Oh, sorry.

436
00:34:13,344 --> 00:34:15,346
I'm a passerby.

437
00:34:15,513 --> 00:34:17,849
I don't wanna get involved.

438
00:34:49,922 --> 00:34:51,966
What the fuck?

439
00:34:52,175 --> 00:34:53,801
Did you see that?

440
00:34:53,968 --> 00:34:56,429
- See what?
- That old man.

441
00:34:56,596 --> 00:34:58,639
He just hit my car.

442
00:35:14,447 --> 00:35:15,907
Hey.

443
00:35:18,701 --> 00:35:21,537
Hello. Oh....

444
00:35:22,205 --> 00:35:25,166
Well, let me see. Um....

445
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,503
Give me the number four,
the <i>pollo, por favor.</i>

446
00:35:28,669 --> 00:35:30,213
- That's to go.
- Yes, sir.

447
00:35:30,379 --> 00:35:31,881
Hey, you.

448
00:35:32,465 --> 00:35:34,091
Hey, gramps.

449
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:36,636
You just hit my car.

450
00:35:37,011 --> 00:35:38,471
You talking to me?

451
00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:41,933
Check out Mr. Magoo here.

452
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:43,142
Yes, sir.

453
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:47,396
You see that car that you
parked your piece of shit next to?

454
00:35:47,563 --> 00:35:49,482
That's mine.

455
00:35:49,649 --> 00:35:51,067
You just ran into it.

456
00:35:51,275 --> 00:35:52,693
No, I don't think I did.

457
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,028
You calling me a liar?

458
00:35:54,779 --> 00:35:56,697
Oh. Uh....

459
00:35:56,864 --> 00:35:57,907
No.

460
00:35:58,199 --> 00:35:59,617
Hey.

461
00:35:59,951 --> 00:36:02,912
I saw it too.
Gonna stand here and deny it?

462
00:36:03,871 --> 00:36:06,457
Oh, guys. I don't know what to tell you.

463
00:36:06,624 --> 00:36:11,170
I'm not aware of hitting anyone's car.
But if I did, I apologise.

464
00:36:11,337 --> 00:36:12,713
So--

465
00:36:13,464 --> 00:36:14,882
6.33.

466
00:36:16,884 --> 00:36:18,094
Um....

467
00:36:21,347 --> 00:36:22,515
You keep the change.

468
00:36:23,182 --> 00:36:25,768
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.

469
00:36:33,192 --> 00:36:34,777
Don't you walk away from me.

470
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:37,154
Hey, pops.
You better listen to the man.

471
00:36:37,321 --> 00:36:38,573
Come on, guys.

472
00:36:38,739 --> 00:36:41,409
Let's just keep things friendly,
all right?

473
00:36:41,576 --> 00:36:43,077
I ain't your friend.

474
00:36:43,244 --> 00:36:45,913
Look. You see that? You.

475
00:36:46,122 --> 00:36:48,624
- You did that.
- Oh, come on. That'll buff right out.

476
00:36:52,253 --> 00:36:54,213
You're gonna make this all right.

477
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,382
You're not leaving until you do.

478
00:36:56,924 --> 00:36:59,886
- Fine. You got a pen?
- A pen?

479
00:37:00,094 --> 00:37:02,346
A pen. We'll exchange information.

480
00:37:02,513 --> 00:37:06,475
Insurance. I have very good coverage.
They'll take care of this.

481
00:37:07,768 --> 00:37:10,646
I don't mess around
with insurance, <i>ése.</i>

482
00:37:10,813 --> 00:37:12,148
Cash.

483
00:37:12,315 --> 00:37:15,735
Listen, I'm willing to
accept responsibility.

484
00:37:15,902 --> 00:37:17,904
But if you're not
going through insurance...

485
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:21,240
...then I have maybe
20, 30 bucks on me, that's all.

486
00:37:21,407 --> 00:37:23,451
Okay, now you're lying to me.

487
00:37:23,618 --> 00:37:25,912
I saw your wallet.
You got plenty in there.

488
00:37:26,621 --> 00:37:28,331
Take it out.

489
00:37:28,497 --> 00:37:31,167
Let's look together. Jog your memory.

490
00:37:32,209 --> 00:37:34,879
You heard him. Take out the wallet.

491
00:37:35,504 --> 00:37:37,340
I just cashed my
Social Security cheque.

492
00:37:37,506 --> 00:37:39,342
It's all I have until the end of
the month.

493
00:37:39,508 --> 00:37:41,218
And I am not giving it to you.

494
00:37:44,055 --> 00:37:45,306
You're not?

495
00:37:45,473 --> 00:37:49,185
I offered to do this the right way.
If you can't accept that, I can't help you.

496
00:37:49,977 --> 00:37:52,438
Oh, come on, guys.

497
00:37:53,272 --> 00:37:56,359
I'm gonna make this
real simple for you.

498
00:37:56,525 --> 00:37:58,611
Give me your wallet.

499
00:37:58,778 --> 00:38:02,031
And maybe you walk away from this.

500
00:38:06,285 --> 00:38:09,121
I'm not giving you a damn thing.

501
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:10,748
No, homes?

502
00:38:11,332 --> 00:38:12,833
You give me your wallet.

503
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,086
- Let's just stay calm here.
- Ha-ha.

504
00:38:15,252 --> 00:38:18,464
You see me sweating, bitch? Wallet.

505
00:38:20,549 --> 00:38:22,259
Wallet.

506
00:38:26,931 --> 00:38:28,599
Wallet.

507
00:38:43,572 --> 00:38:45,533
There's, like, 400 here.

508
00:38:47,201 --> 00:38:49,495
You got some crazy lip on you,
old man.

509
00:38:49,662 --> 00:38:52,456
Your life worth 400 bucks?

510
00:38:52,623 --> 00:38:54,250
Tuco, time to bounce.

511
00:38:54,417 --> 00:38:56,669
Yeah, go, go.

512
00:39:06,512 --> 00:39:10,433
You, one lucky old man.

513
00:39:11,267 --> 00:39:12,601
What the hell? Let go.

514
00:39:13,269 --> 00:39:15,062
Let go.

515
00:39:16,897 --> 00:39:18,733
Let-- Let go.

516
00:39:20,026 --> 00:39:21,068
Let go.

517
00:39:22,403 --> 00:39:23,904
Let go.

518
00:39:24,864 --> 00:39:26,490
Let go.

519
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:44,300
- Let me see your hands.
- Hands.

520
00:39:44,508 --> 00:39:46,969
Hands up! Now!

521
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:50,473
On the ground.

522
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:52,183
That all you got?

523
00:39:52,516 --> 00:39:54,560
Get on the ground!

524
00:40:53,452 --> 00:40:54,912
Wow.

525
00:40:56,413 --> 00:40:57,915
Look at you.

526
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:02,169
Are you gonna have to testify?

527
00:41:02,795 --> 00:41:07,216
The cops witnessed him
in the commission of a felony.

528
00:41:07,633 --> 00:41:09,426
My wallet in his pocket.

529
00:41:09,593 --> 00:41:13,305
Had the gun.
He gets a five to 10 stretch.

530
00:41:18,102 --> 00:41:19,895
Twenty-five.

531
00:41:20,521 --> 00:41:22,439
You definitely earned it.

532
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:28,737
Still, you could have gotten
twice as much for one-tenth of the hassle.

533
00:41:28,904 --> 00:41:30,781
You would've
done the world a favour.

534
00:41:31,073 --> 00:41:33,659
You wouldn't look like someone
took a pipe to your face.

535
00:41:33,826 --> 00:41:35,744
Plus, when Tuco gets out...

536
00:41:35,911 --> 00:41:38,122
...maybe he comes looking for you.

537
00:41:38,289 --> 00:41:40,207
Get to the point.

538
00:41:40,374 --> 00:41:44,253
I'm just saying, you went a long way
to not pull that trigger.

539
00:41:46,005 --> 00:41:47,506
Why?
