00:02:38,326 --> 00:02:40,286
Somebody!

Hey! Hey!

27
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,345
Hey!

34
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:23,009
Ah. Here he is.

35
00:06:23,176 --> 00:06:25,303
Great. Jimmy, right on time.
Good to see you.

36
00:06:25,595 --> 00:06:27,221
Hello, Howard.

37
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:30,016
- Hey. Hi.
- James McGill, Clifford Main.

38
00:06:30,183 --> 00:06:32,518
Just Jimmy.
It's a pleasure to meet you, Clifford.

39
00:06:32,727 --> 00:06:35,313
Likewise. We know all about
your work on Sandpiper.

40
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:36,773
Well, it's a group effort.

41
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:40,276
I mean, the folks at HHM
are just knocking it out of the park.

42
00:06:40,485 --> 00:06:43,362
- Well, the case wouldn't exist without you.
- Absolutely.

43
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:46,908
Once you get him on your team,
you'll know why I call him Charlie Hustle.

44
00:06:47,075 --> 00:06:50,995
Jimmy, these are my associates,
Brian Archuleta and Erin Brill.

45
00:06:51,162 --> 00:06:53,122
- Nice to meet you both.
- Great to meet you.

46
00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:55,208
I hate to do this...

47
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:57,502
...but could I borrow Ms. Wexler
for a moment?

48
00:06:57,668 --> 00:07:00,963
- If you will excuse us....
- Ahem. Pardon me.

49
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:10,098
- What's going on?
- I just.... Ahem. Listen, here's the thing.

50
00:07:10,306 --> 00:07:14,393
If I take this job,
does that mean the two of us...?

51
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:16,604
I mean....

52
00:07:16,771 --> 00:07:19,440
- Does it mean...?
- What? What?

53
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:21,025
What the hell is this?

54
00:07:21,234 --> 00:07:24,862
If I take this job today
with Davis & Main...

55
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:28,074
...does that mean that you and me...?

56
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:32,370
Is this-- Is this gonna happen?

57
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,252
Jimmy.

58
00:07:39,544 --> 00:07:41,170
I....

59
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:45,299
I....

60
00:07:49,387 --> 00:07:52,640
One thing has absolutely nothing to do
with the other.

61
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,435
- Nothing at all?
- No.

62
00:07:56,602 --> 00:07:58,646
Of course not, why would it?

63
00:08:00,064 --> 00:08:01,440
Great.

64
00:08:02,692 --> 00:08:04,026
Uh....

65
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:07,071
Sorry about that.

66
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,700
Listen, I just wanna say thank you,
sincerely, for your interest in me.

67
00:08:10,867 --> 00:08:15,037
It's an honour to be considered,
but at this time-- At this time...

68
00:08:16,414 --> 00:08:20,209
...I'm gonna have to take myself
out of the running. Thanks.

69
00:08:20,418 --> 00:08:22,170
- Thank you, Howard.
- Uh....

70
00:08:22,587 --> 00:08:24,130
Jimmy?

71
00:08:28,843 --> 00:08:30,595
Well, that was quick.

72
00:08:30,803 --> 00:08:33,097
- No charge.
- Help me out here.

73
00:08:33,306 --> 00:08:39,896
Did I dream it or did I have
$1,600,000 on my desk in cash?

74
00:08:40,104 --> 00:08:42,732
No one on God's green earth
knew we had it.

75
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,483
We could've split it fifty-fifty.

76
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:48,279
We could've gone home
with $800,000 each...

77
00:08:48,446 --> 00:08:50,323
...tax free.

78
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:52,575
Your point being?

79
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:53,951
Why didn't we?

80
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:57,914
I remember you saying something
about doing the right thing.

81
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,124
You wanna know why
I didn't take that money?

82
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,001
Is that what you're asking?

83
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:04,045
Yeah, that's what I'm asking.

84
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:07,131
Me personally, I was hired to do a job...

85
00:09:07,298 --> 00:09:10,468
...I did it, that's as far as it goes.

86
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:12,845
Yeah, well...

87
00:09:13,054 --> 00:09:14,722
...I know what stopped me.

88
00:09:14,931 --> 00:09:19,060
And you know what?
It's never stopping me again.

89
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:48,673
<i>Chào các cô,</i> ladies.

90
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,260
Mrs. Nguyen, it's a beautiful day out,
you should get out once in a while.

91
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:53,970
Throw a Frisbee, have some fun.

92
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:55,805
I have a business to run.

93
00:09:55,972 --> 00:09:58,057
No, the business is running you.

94
00:09:58,266 --> 00:10:01,435
Listen to me. You'll thank me later.

95
00:10:04,647 --> 00:10:07,441
Cucumber water for customer only.

96
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,817
Hey, it's me.

97
00:11:33,736 --> 00:11:36,322
Jesus. Hello?

98
00:11:36,781 --> 00:11:38,449
Hello?

99
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:44,747
It's me. I got a new car. You like it?

100
00:11:45,373 --> 00:11:47,750
We're not taking that to the meet.

101
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,127
How are we gonna get there?

102
00:11:51,921 --> 00:11:54,799
I'll drive my car.

103
00:11:55,091 --> 00:11:58,928
- Why?
- This business requires restraint.

104
00:11:59,095 --> 00:12:02,098
That is the opposite of restraint.

105
00:12:02,932 --> 00:12:05,059
But I like it.

106
00:12:05,226 --> 00:12:06,519
I mean, I'm proud of it.

107
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:09,146
Good, then you be proud of it
on your own time.

108
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:12,024
But not with me, I'm not getting in that.

109
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:17,613
Okay, then don't.

110
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:21,826
Honestly, you don't really do anything.

111
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:24,578
I've been paying you
the salary of three people...

112
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:27,164
...to just stand behind me.

113
00:12:27,373 --> 00:12:31,752
You know? And these last few deals,
this Nacho fella, he's been coming alone.

114
00:12:31,961 --> 00:12:36,465
I mean, if he doesn't need backup men,
then, I mean, why do I need you?

115
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:38,092
I should just go alone.

116
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:40,344
I'm throwing-- I'm throwing away money.

117
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:43,931
Just tossing it away into the trash.

118
00:12:44,682 --> 00:12:47,643
Look, you do whatever you want,
but I'm advising you...

119
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:50,771
...do not go to that meet
without someone watching your back.

120
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:52,940
Yeah, well,
of course you're gonna say that.

121
00:12:53,441 --> 00:12:56,110
I mean, you don't wanna be
out of this easy-peasy job.

122
00:12:56,277 --> 00:12:59,613
Well, I'm sorry,
but this is the gravy train...

123
00:12:59,822 --> 00:13:02,199
...and it's leaving the station right now.

124
00:13:02,408 --> 00:13:05,244
So last chance.

125
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:08,080
All aboard.

126
00:13:12,084 --> 00:13:13,669
Seriously, last chance.

127
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:17,339
I'm gonna count to, say, 10,
and then I'm--

128
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:21,635
All right, then,
your services are no longer needed.

129
00:14:10,643 --> 00:14:11,644
No old guy?

130
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:14,188
What, did he break a hip
or something?

131
00:14:14,355 --> 00:14:15,523
I know, right?

132
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:18,734
Yeah, no, we-- We parted ways.

133
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:21,487
Yeah, saw things differently, so....

134
00:14:21,654 --> 00:14:23,447
You know how it is.

135
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:37,836
This is interesting.

136
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,464
Oh, yeah. You like it?

137
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:43,509
- Can I take a look?
- Oh, be my guest.

138
00:14:43,676 --> 00:14:46,303
Get in, check it out.

139
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,225
Wow.

140
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:57,523
- Impressive.
- Thank you.

141
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:59,858
Get in, feel the leather.

142
00:15:00,985 --> 00:15:03,237
Yeah, it's a H2.

143
00:15:03,404 --> 00:15:04,738
Brand-new off the line.

144
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:08,450
Slimmer than the H1,
but longer, more height.

145
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:12,788
Yeah, it's a honey.
V8 engine, 325 horsepower.

146
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:17,418
Tri-zone climate controls,
so you can have a girl in a bikini...

147
00:15:17,585 --> 00:15:21,255
...and another in a parka, and they're
both gonna be comfortable. Ha-ha.

148
00:15:21,422 --> 00:15:23,674
You're riding around
with two girls in your SUV.

149
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:27,344
- You'd be really comfortable, huh?
- Oh, yeah. Yes.

150
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:29,388
I'm gonna count this quick.

151
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:32,266
Do your thing, make sure it's right.

152
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:48,866
Okey-dokey, we are good.

153
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:52,494
Same as before.

154
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:54,413
Still factory sealed.

155
00:15:54,622 --> 00:15:57,166
And as always,
you're welcome to count them.

156
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,751
I trust you.

157
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:01,420
Great, thank you.

158
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,382
See you next time.

159
00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:54,306
Hello. Yes.

160
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:57,059
No, sorry.

161
00:16:57,601 --> 00:17:02,272
Yes, this is James McGill,
but I'm no longer a lawyer, so....

162
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:04,149
That's right, not a lawyer. Bye.

163
00:17:09,405 --> 00:17:11,740
So this is what a midlife crisis looks like?

164
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:14,201
Not midlife crisis.

165
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:16,662
Clarity. Midlife clarity.

166
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:19,081
Clarity? Huh.

167
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:23,627
Clearly explain to me why you walked out
on the best job opportunity of your life.

168
00:17:25,963 --> 00:17:28,048
Get in the pool and I'll tell you.

169
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:31,802
- Get in the pool?
- Yeah, come on.

170
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:35,472
Pop in the gift shop and buy a bathing
suit. Get a one-piece, nothing fancy.

171
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:38,392
The water is perfect, it's 82 degrees.

172
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,145
You can order a drink,
and you gotta try this crab dip.

173
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:44,314
- Why are you acting like this?
- I'm not acting like anything.

174
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:47,693
I just finally decided to be me.

175
00:17:48,444 --> 00:17:51,780
Everything okay, Mr. Cumpston?
Would you like another drink?

176
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:54,783
I'm good with this.

177
00:17:57,619 --> 00:17:59,830
I'll tell you what, Mr. Cumpston.

178
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:03,876
If you really wanna talk,
I'll be in the bar. Not for long.

179
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:11,633
Hey, Rolando, cheque.

180
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:17,014
What do you--
What do you mean, quit the law?

181
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:19,057
I quit it, simple as that.

182
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:21,727
Oh, well, thanks for explaining,
Jimmy...

183
00:18:21,894 --> 00:18:23,854
- ...it's super clear now.
- Hey, buddy?

184
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:26,440
Is that a misprint right there?
It's gotta be, right?

185
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:27,941
- The Zafiro Añejo?
- Yeah.

186
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:32,654
- That's correct, actually, believe it or not.
- Holy shit, a $50 shot of tequila?

187
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:34,907
- Is it worth it?
- Apparently.

188
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:36,784
It's kind of a personal choice thing.

189
00:18:37,493 --> 00:18:41,872
Well, I can't die without trying
a $50 shot of tequila, so two.

190
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,666
<i>Dos,</i> neat, and we can charge that
to the room, can't we?

191
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,795
No, we can't. We....

192
00:18:48,587 --> 00:18:50,255
I am paying.

193
00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:52,841
And he will be having
a shot of your well brand...

194
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:55,010
...and I'll have a glass
of your house red.

195
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:57,805
We have a cabernet,
a pinot and a syrah.

196
00:18:58,096 --> 00:19:00,015
Whatever, dealer's choice.

197
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:02,976
- Something with alcohol.
- You got it.

198
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:09,191
Jimmy.

199
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:11,360
Did something happen in Cicero?

200
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:13,403
Why did something have to happen?

201
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:16,907
When I talked to you about Davis &
Main, you were ready to take the job.

202
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:19,576
Now you're back,
and you're suddenly quitting the law?

203
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:22,162
Cheating hotels
out of expensive liquor.

204
00:19:22,371 --> 00:19:24,206
Wearing a weird pinkie ring.

205
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:26,500
What, are you in the Mafia now?

206
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:31,421
Asking if we have a future.

207
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:35,259
I mean, where did that come from?

208
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:38,011
I don't know, I just....

209
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:41,390
Cicero has nothing to do with it.

210
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:44,226
It's my whole life. Well...

211
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:46,937
...my life since Chuck
made me come to Albuquerque.

212
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:51,149
Ever since I got here, all I've done
is try to make Chuck happy.

213
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:53,735
Bend over backwards to please Chuck.

214
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:57,322
Chuck, Chuck, Chuck. Well, no more.

215
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:00,826
You quitting the law,
isn't that exactly what Chuck wants?

216
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:04,121
Who cares? This is for me, okay?

217
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:06,790
I got into the law
for all the wrong reasons.

218
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:08,500
I'm trusting my instincts.

219
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:11,920
I think that my talents
are better spent elsewhere.

220
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:14,715
Where?
Floating in somebody else's pool?

221
00:20:17,301 --> 00:20:19,428
Jimmy, you're a great lawyer.

222
00:20:19,595 --> 00:20:21,013
Why give that up?

223
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:23,307
I'm not saying it didn't have its moments.

224
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:26,643
But the stuff I liked about it,
selling people, convincing people...

225
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:29,062
...I don't have to be a lawyer to do that.

226
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:32,274
Besides, people tell me
how they see me...

227
00:20:32,441 --> 00:20:34,610
- ...and it's not as a lawyer.
- All right.

228
00:20:35,986 --> 00:20:37,779
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

229
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:40,574
Let me know if I can
get you guys anything else.

230
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:42,534
- Bobby, what up, brother-man?
- Oh, thanks.

231
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:45,829
Short it.

232
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:47,539
Short it.

233
00:20:48,457 --> 00:20:49,875
Short it. Short that shit.

234
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:53,795
That stock is useless, it's got no legs.
It's like a circus freak minus the fun.

235
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:56,048
That one's even worse.
Who's giving you these?

236
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:57,674
Do me a favour. Take a pillow...

237
00:20:57,841 --> 00:21:01,261
...put it over that stock's face
until you hear the deathbed queef.

238
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:03,263
- Okay, so?
- It's a loser.

239
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,849
If you're not gonna be a lawyer,
then what?

240
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:09,311
Float around and wait
for your Sandpiper money to roll in?

241
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:14,191
- That could take years.
- Sandpiper has no bearing on this at all.

242
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:17,861
Okay, then, what's the plan?

243
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:20,280
- To be open to the universe.
- Okay, so no plan.

244
00:21:20,489 --> 00:21:23,825
Just walk the earth?
Like Jules at the end of <i>Pulp Fiction?</i>

245
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:27,996
Look, whatever the universe presents,
whatever opportunity arises...

246
00:21:28,205 --> 00:21:30,207
- ...I will take it.
- Whatever opportunity?

247
00:21:30,374 --> 00:21:32,960
- Yeah.
- Wasn't Davis & Main an opportunity?

248
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:35,837
It's a great opportunity,
and you're walking away from it.

249
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:38,924
Look...

250
00:21:39,091 --> 00:21:41,969
...shouldn't you at least try the job
before you say no?

251
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:44,221
And waste everyone's time,
including my own?

252
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:46,515
Kim, I appreciate your concern...

253
00:21:46,682 --> 00:21:48,642
...but it's not for me. I don't want it.

254
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:51,687
Jimmy, do you remember
how long you studied for that bar?

255
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:53,605
- How hard you worked?
- It's like a burn victim....

256
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:56,149
All that effort,
you're just gonna toss it away?

257
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:58,902
That's the sunk cost fallacy.

258
00:21:59,111 --> 00:22:01,780
- The what?
- The fallacy of sunk cost.

259
00:22:01,947 --> 00:22:04,658
It's what gamblers do,
they throw good money after bad...

260
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:06,827
...thinking they can
turn their luck around.

261
00:22:06,994 --> 00:22:09,287
It's like, "I've already spent
this much money...

262
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:11,665
...or time, whatever,
I gotta keep going!"

263
00:22:11,832 --> 00:22:14,543
No, there's no reward
at the end of this game.

264
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:16,545
You are making a mistake.

265
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:18,839
I know you're making a mistake.

266
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:22,092
I've been doing the "right thing"
and where has it gotten me?

267
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:23,802
- Nowhere.
- I'm sorry, I don't....

268
00:22:23,969 --> 00:22:27,180
Yeah. Not my thing.

269
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:29,683
Not my thing. Still not my thing.

270
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:34,021
- I don't get it. I just don't get it.
- It's what's right for me.

271
00:22:34,521 --> 00:22:38,567
Ha-ha-ha.
Donkey balls. Pure donkey balls, dude.

272
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:41,319
Wall Street's for suckers.
Who needs that aggravation?

273
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:43,822
If the Oracle doesn't have to live there,
I don't.

274
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:47,743
I can make a million-dollar stock trade
on my laptop sitting on a toilet.

275
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:50,495
Like Midas,
shitting gold bricks on my throne.

276
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:54,082
That's why Spiegelman and Deitch
want my business. I'm a golden god.

277
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:56,877
Of course I remember.
Who forgets that?

278
00:22:57,044 --> 00:22:59,713
That fart had the anger
of a repressed minority community.

279
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:01,631
You fart like that in someone's face...

280
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:04,259
...you're gonna give them pinkeye for life.
Ha-ha-ha.

281
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:06,094
Good convo, bro.

282
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:07,971
Till next time, brother-man.

283
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:10,140
- Flip side, on it, check you.
- Come with me.

284
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:12,809
- What?
- Just come on, trust me.

285
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:14,686
What are you gonna do?

286
00:23:14,895 --> 00:23:18,356
You wanna understand
what I'm talking about? Follow my lead.

287
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:30,786
Hey, buddy,
could you settle a bet for us?

288
00:23:30,952 --> 00:23:32,579
- Can I what?
- Sorry...

289
00:23:32,746 --> 00:23:36,083
...I don't want it to sound like
I was eavesdropping, but I kind of was.

290
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:38,251
We heard you talking about stocks.

291
00:23:39,294 --> 00:23:41,421
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, so question...

292
00:23:41,588 --> 00:23:45,342
...if you could settle a debate
between me and my sister.

293
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:48,345
- We probably shouldn't bother--
- I wouldn't normally do this.

294
00:23:48,512 --> 00:23:52,182
But we need an expert.
This guy sounds like he knows his stuff.

295
00:23:53,975 --> 00:23:57,354
- Yeah, go.
- Okay, here's the question:

296
00:23:57,521 --> 00:24:00,690
When it comes to the stock market,
is there a financial limit...

297
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:03,735
...to how much
a person's allowed to invest?

298
00:24:04,528 --> 00:24:05,987
A limit?

299
00:24:06,905 --> 00:24:08,490
No, no limit.

300
00:24:08,657 --> 00:24:11,076
Knew it! Oh, even if it's an inheritance?

301
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:13,662
You know, with, like,
inheritance taxes and whatnot?

302
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:16,748
- Nope, same.
- That's-- Oh, fantastic.

303
00:24:16,957 --> 00:24:18,834
Thank you, buddy. See, no limit.

304
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,462
Told you we could invest it all,
and it's a smart move too.

305
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:24,923
- Sticking it all in the bank? No.
- Um....

306
00:24:25,132 --> 00:24:29,636
Yeah, you can invest all your money,
just make sure you diversify.

307
00:24:29,845 --> 00:24:32,305
Yeah, diversify.

308
00:24:32,472 --> 00:24:35,433
That's-- We gotta-- Hey...

309
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:37,185
...what do you mean, "diversify"?

310
00:24:37,394 --> 00:24:41,940
Well, diversify is-- You know the saying
"don't put all your eggs in one basket"?

311
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:45,610
- Right? Same principle.
- Makes complete sense. Thank you.

312
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:48,613
If I had an idea of the money
we're talking about, ballpark...

313
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,658
...I could give you examples
of smart diversification.

314
00:24:52,576 --> 00:24:54,536
Yeah, um....

315
00:24:55,996 --> 00:24:58,832
Look, an uncle on our father's side
recently passed...

316
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:05,172
...and he left us somewhere
in the neighbourhood of 1.4 million.

317
00:25:05,338 --> 00:25:09,259
And I don't mean to be greedy,
but I think if we invest it smart now...

318
00:25:09,426 --> 00:25:11,052
...we could double it, triple it...

319
00:25:11,219 --> 00:25:14,598
...we could quadruple
the whole inheritance, right?

320
00:25:14,764 --> 00:25:16,725
In my opinion?

321
00:25:16,892 --> 00:25:18,894
Fortune favours the bold, man.

322
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:22,022
If you're free to join me for a drink,
I can give you a consult.

323
00:25:22,189 --> 00:25:25,609
That's all right, we'll do it ourselves
through an online brokerage site.

324
00:25:25,817 --> 00:25:29,905
We're just gonna pick classic-- Like,
I think they're called blue chip stocks.

325
00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:32,365
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You can totally do it yourself.

326
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:33,867
Shoot for the tried and true.

327
00:25:34,034 --> 00:25:37,662
Of course, you might be putting your
cash in the <i>Hindenburg, Andrea Doria...</i>

328
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:39,497
<i>... Corky Romano.</i>

329
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:43,293
Right? They all seemed
rock solid beforehand. But then....

330
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:46,213
- Yeah, not good.
- Not good, yeah.

331
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:47,547
So how do you know?

332
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:50,842
Well, that's where
someone like myself comes in.

333
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:54,846
Proven track record as a wealth manager.
I take calculated but aggressive risks...

334
00:25:55,013 --> 00:25:58,225
...because I wanna catch lightning,
and I do.

335
00:25:58,433 --> 00:26:01,311
- I'm practically a money printing machine.
- That sounds good.

336
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:03,897
A money printing machine.

337
00:26:04,314 --> 00:26:08,526
Listen, there's a little booth over here,
there's some privacy, we can talk.

338
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:12,072
No obligations,
we can just rap about this a little bit.

339
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:14,282
- Yeah, I guess.
- Yeah?

340
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:16,576
What do you say, sis?

341
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:18,703
Can we just talk?

342
00:26:21,957 --> 00:26:24,626
Electric slide on in there.
We'll rap a little, it's no--

343
00:26:24,793 --> 00:26:28,004
- My name's Ken, by the way.
- Viktor, with a K.

344
00:26:28,171 --> 00:26:30,423
Cool, Viktor with a K.

345
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,176
And this lovely lady is?

346
00:26:35,303 --> 00:26:37,764
It's Giselle.

347
00:26:37,973 --> 00:26:40,267
- Giselle Saint Claire.
- Ah. Lovely.

348
00:26:41,351 --> 00:26:44,896
Please, sit. I won't bite.

349
00:26:46,106 --> 00:26:49,526
So Viktor with a K and Giselle,
exotic names.

350
00:26:49,734 --> 00:26:53,196
- They're Dutch.
- Well, Boer to be precise.

351
00:26:53,405 --> 00:26:55,991
Our father's side of the family
is from South Africa...

352
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:59,160
...which is where Uncle Humphrey
passed away.

353
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:03,415
South Africa, they grow them beautiful
down there, right? Charlize Theron.

354
00:27:03,832 --> 00:27:07,043
- And you.
- Oh, well.

355
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:09,462
I've never actually been,
but hope to go someday.

356
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:11,464
Tell you what,
when I'm done with you...

357
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:14,592
- ...you might take your own private jet.
- Nice.

358
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:17,178
Excuse me, hi. We are sitting here now.

359
00:27:17,345 --> 00:27:19,472
We could use a wine list
if you get a chance--

360
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:21,308
Hey, are you a tequila fan?

361
00:27:21,933 --> 00:27:24,352
Yes. You down for that?

362
00:27:25,437 --> 00:27:27,355
You ever try Zafiro Añejo?

363
00:27:27,522 --> 00:27:30,984
No, I have not, but I'm down for whatever.
Three of whatever she just said.

364
00:27:31,192 --> 00:27:33,194
- You got it.
- All right.

365
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,905
So stock market, a great investment...

366
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:38,241
...and you're picking the right time
to jump in.

367
00:27:38,408 --> 00:27:40,577
Why do you listen to him? He's an idiot.

368
00:27:40,744 --> 00:27:43,663
He talks about his cars. He talks about....

369
00:27:44,331 --> 00:27:46,833
- How many cars did he have?
- I don't think....

370
00:27:49,461 --> 00:27:51,796
- It makes sense.
- That's it, Ken.

371
00:27:52,005 --> 00:27:53,298
Oh, yeah.

372
00:27:53,465 --> 00:27:56,426
Compliments of the bartender.
Thought you might want a souvenir.

373
00:27:56,593 --> 00:27:59,471
- My God, did we drink the entire bottle?
- Not yet, we didn't.

374
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:01,139
Right here. Hey, hey, cheers.

375
00:28:01,306 --> 00:28:03,391
I think we're ready for the cheque.

376
00:28:07,937 --> 00:28:09,147
Oh....

377
00:28:09,314 --> 00:28:12,150
No, really, it's a smart way to go.

378
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:14,944
Okay, but, so to be clear...

379
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:17,697
...you take the money
directly from our account...

380
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:19,407
- ...and invest it--
- Diversify it.

381
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:22,952
Diversify it. And then all the dividends
and all the profits...

382
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:25,705
...and the what-have-you
comes back into our account.

383
00:28:25,872 --> 00:28:27,999
Boom. Absolutely.

384
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:31,127
You'll get a statement showing
how much your money is growing...

385
00:28:31,294 --> 00:28:34,839
- ...biggest bulls of the month, etcetera.
- Ken, buddy...

386
00:28:35,256 --> 00:28:37,342
...let's do this.

387
00:28:38,218 --> 00:28:39,344
Great.

388
00:28:39,511 --> 00:28:42,138
Right there, Viktor with a K.
And, Giselle, you are next.

389
00:28:42,347 --> 00:28:43,556
- This is so exciting.
- Mm-hm.

390
00:28:43,723 --> 00:28:45,642
- Folks, it's been a pleasure.
- Oops. I got that.

391
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:48,019
- Can't let you do it, son.
- Wait, what? Ken.

392
00:28:48,228 --> 00:28:51,272
- You are the greatest. Thank you.
- No problem-o.

393
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:53,400
This will be the best decision
you'll make.

394
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:55,026
We should get out of your hair.

395
00:28:55,235 --> 00:28:58,446
- Yeah.
- Wait, wait, wait, this...

396
00:28:58,947 --> 00:29:01,408
...is for you.
Now, that's got all my contact info.

397
00:29:01,616 --> 00:29:05,245
Call me anytime with questions,
or anything at all.

398
00:29:05,787 --> 00:29:07,622
- Ken.
- Bye.

399
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:08,790
Call me, guys.

400
00:29:08,998 --> 00:29:10,333
- Bye.
- Try and stop us.

401
00:29:13,169 --> 00:29:15,964
Wow. Heh.

402
00:29:16,297 --> 00:29:18,967
Just wow.

403
00:29:31,855 --> 00:29:33,523
Hey.

404
00:29:34,983 --> 00:29:36,526
What--?

405
00:29:36,901 --> 00:29:39,571
- Is this right?
- Yes, sir, it is.

406
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:46,077
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

407
00:29:48,288 --> 00:29:49,747
- Zafiro Añejo!
- Shh!

408
00:29:49,914 --> 00:29:52,584
Shut up. He's gonna come out.

409
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:56,463
- Oh, no, I didn't read the fine print.
- Wait!

410
00:29:56,629 --> 00:29:58,339
Yeah!

411
00:30:00,091 --> 00:30:03,011
- Holy crap.
- I can't--

412
00:30:45,678 --> 00:30:47,305
Can I borrow that when you're done?

413
00:30:48,431 --> 00:30:50,558
No, that's gross.

414
00:30:51,309 --> 00:30:53,811
How is it gross?
Our germs have already intermingled.

415
00:30:53,978 --> 00:30:56,189
It's my toothbrush, it's different.

416
00:30:57,232 --> 00:31:00,318
- Why is it different?
- Because.

417
00:31:00,485 --> 00:31:04,739
You know, gums bleed,
and there's cold sores....

418
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:07,242
All sorts of food and weird--

419
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:08,785
- Come on.
- What? No!

420
00:31:08,993 --> 00:31:11,079
- Come on, I'll do it right now.
- I don't care.

421
00:31:11,246 --> 00:31:13,581
- I need to brush my teeth.
- I don't have an extra.

422
00:31:13,748 --> 00:31:16,668
That's fine. I got this.

423
00:31:21,381 --> 00:31:23,758
- Good, I'm fine with it.
- Yeah, me too.

424
00:31:23,967 --> 00:31:25,677
Wait till you see what I floss with.

425
00:31:47,156 --> 00:31:49,033
That's a keeper.

426
00:31:49,576 --> 00:31:52,704
Thank you, Viktor with a K.

427
00:31:54,831 --> 00:31:57,875
Hey, wouldn't it be great
if we could do that every night?

428
00:31:58,209 --> 00:31:59,961
Yes, it would.

429
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:06,134
But we can't.

430
00:32:08,011 --> 00:32:09,637
I know. Yeah.

431
00:32:09,846 --> 00:32:13,725
But I'm just saying,
if we could it would be great.

432
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:16,102
But I know we can't.

433
00:32:16,894 --> 00:32:19,606
Oh, crap, I can't be late today.

434
00:32:21,274 --> 00:32:22,900
Howard is doling out assignments...

435
00:32:23,067 --> 00:32:26,821
...and the last one through the door
could get stuck in Doc Review.

436
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,952
You got somewhere to go?

437
00:32:33,661 --> 00:32:36,789
Yeah. Yeah, I got somewhere.

438
00:32:45,048 --> 00:32:46,674
You good?

439
00:32:47,175 --> 00:32:49,177
Yeah, all good.

440
00:33:24,212 --> 00:33:27,382
Daniel Wormald.
I'm Officer Baker, this is Officer Saxton.

441
00:33:27,548 --> 00:33:29,884
Yeah, please, come on in.

442
00:33:31,344 --> 00:33:33,763
Come in, it's over here.

443
00:33:34,138 --> 00:33:35,556
See what they did?

444
00:33:35,765 --> 00:33:37,642
I mean, all gone. All of them.

445
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:40,395
- Just--
- What's all gone?

446
00:33:40,561 --> 00:33:43,064
I have-- I had a baseball card collection.

447
00:33:43,272 --> 00:33:47,068
- A major collection, all stolen.
- Sorry to hear that.

448
00:33:47,276 --> 00:33:49,904
Was it common knowledge
that you have baseball cards?

449
00:33:50,113 --> 00:33:51,656
No, not really.

450
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:54,283
So nobody in particular
you can think of wanted them?

451
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:57,245
No, not that I-- No.

452
00:33:57,412 --> 00:34:01,332
- How'd they get in?
- The back door over here.

453
00:34:01,541 --> 00:34:03,543
It was open
when I came home for lunch.

454
00:34:03,751 --> 00:34:04,877
I mean, it was locked...

455
00:34:05,044 --> 00:34:07,839
...but they must have jimmied it open
or something.

456
00:34:08,005 --> 00:34:11,426
Uh-huh.
What time you figure this happened?

457
00:34:11,634 --> 00:34:14,595
I left for work at 8:15,
came home for lunch at 12:30...

458
00:34:14,762 --> 00:34:17,432
- ...and called you immediately.
- Was anything else taken?

459
00:34:17,598 --> 00:34:21,269
- Cash, a fair bit.
- How much cash?

460
00:34:21,436 --> 00:34:25,398
Uh, I don't know. You know, let's focus
on what's important here.

461
00:34:25,606 --> 00:34:28,317
You know, all I really care about
are my baseball cards.

462
00:34:28,526 --> 00:34:32,905
I have a Topps Mickey Mantle
rookie card that's irreplaceable.

463
00:34:33,072 --> 00:34:35,575
It's a mint, 60-40, 90-10 on the reverse.

464
00:34:35,742 --> 00:34:36,868
I can go on.

465
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:38,786
All my cards are in top-loaders...

466
00:34:38,953 --> 00:34:41,664
...but if they're taken out
and exposed to the elements...

467
00:34:41,831 --> 00:34:44,041
...I mean, or creased, God forbid...

468
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:47,754
...I mean, you're looking at a 9-point
downgrade in a matter of seconds.

469
00:34:48,004 --> 00:34:52,383
I understand the first 48 hours are the
most important in investigations like this...

470
00:34:52,592 --> 00:34:57,221
...so the more time passes, I mean,
the less likely we are of a recovery.

471
00:34:57,388 --> 00:35:01,350
So time is of the essence here, guys.

472
00:35:01,517 --> 00:35:04,395
Well, we're gonna help you out
the best we can, Mr. Wormald.

473
00:35:04,562 --> 00:35:05,813
Good.

474
00:35:07,565 --> 00:35:09,442
They really tossed this place.

475
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:12,236
Are you sure they weren't looking
for anything else?

476
00:35:12,987 --> 00:35:15,239
- Like what?
- I don't know.

477
00:35:15,406 --> 00:35:16,824
Just wondering your thoughts.

478
00:35:17,325 --> 00:35:18,993
I assume more baseball cards.

479
00:35:19,202 --> 00:35:21,704
Did you have more
than the ones in the case here?

480
00:35:21,871 --> 00:35:23,498
Yes, in back. Thousands.

481
00:35:23,664 --> 00:35:26,709
But these were the crown jewels
over here.

482
00:35:26,876 --> 00:35:29,212
You know, the all-star line-up.

483
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,005
Right.

484
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,299
Hm.

485
00:35:34,801 --> 00:35:36,969
- What?
- Just trying to make sense of it.

486
00:35:37,136 --> 00:35:38,262
What's to make sense of?

487
00:35:38,429 --> 00:35:42,350
I mean, isn't it as simple as the perp
was looking for more baseball cards?

488
00:35:42,558 --> 00:35:47,063
Or hopped up on speed or whatever
and went nuts with the vandalism?

489
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:50,650
Yeah. I mean, that could be, yeah.

490
00:35:51,776 --> 00:35:55,071
Pretty sweet Hummer
parked in the driveway. That yours?

491
00:35:55,238 --> 00:35:58,533
Yeah, that's mine. It's a lease.

492
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,118
Got a great deal on it.

493
00:36:02,662 --> 00:36:04,705
It's very sweet.

494
00:36:05,289 --> 00:36:08,167
They say Arnold Schwarzenegger's
the reason that Hummers exist.

495
00:36:08,334 --> 00:36:11,045
- Don't know how, but that's what they say.
- No kidding?

496
00:36:11,212 --> 00:36:12,588
Huh.

497
00:36:13,464 --> 00:36:15,925
What kind of work do you do,
Mr. Wormald?

498
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:17,969
I work IT...

499
00:36:18,177 --> 00:36:20,388
...for a pharmaceutical company.

500
00:36:20,596 --> 00:36:25,184
Wow, computers.
God, I should've gotten into computers.

501
00:36:25,393 --> 00:36:27,061
- I'd have that same Hummer.
- Right.

502
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:29,438
Look, guys, I'm glad you like my car...

503
00:36:29,605 --> 00:36:34,443
...but I think we're looking through
the wrong end of the telescope here.

504
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:37,822
- The priority is my baseball cards.
- Of course.

505
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:42,785
Yes, now, I have a detailed manifest
of my entire collection...

506
00:36:42,952 --> 00:36:46,080
...and asterisks next to
the high-ticket items.

507
00:36:46,247 --> 00:36:48,583
It's clear which ones
they'll try to fence first...

508
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:51,043
...because they're
super, super valuable.

509
00:36:51,252 --> 00:36:55,756
So you're gonna wanna get this list
out to pawn shops, collectors.

510
00:36:55,965 --> 00:36:59,552
Question anyone who's done
any sort of crime like this in the past.

511
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,513
You know, the usual suspects.

512
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,433
Can I get you the list
so you can start investigating?

513
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:09,186
- Yeah, if you could get us that list....
- Okay, I'll print it out.

514
00:37:09,353 --> 00:37:10,938
Hank Aaron, mint.

515
00:37:11,147 --> 00:37:13,524
God, my signed Derek Jeter.

516
00:37:13,691 --> 00:37:15,151
Willie Mays O-Pee-Chee.

517
00:37:15,568 --> 00:37:19,113
Gotta breathe.
Just keep breathing, keep breathing.

518
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,616
- Okay.
- I know, right?

519
00:37:21,908 --> 00:37:23,784
- Left the TV...
- Uh-huh.

520
00:37:23,993 --> 00:37:26,412
- ...left the computer.
- Right.

521
00:37:28,539 --> 00:37:29,540
Huh.

522
00:37:35,755 --> 00:37:37,757
There's something wrong
with this picture.

523
00:39:03,551 --> 00:39:04,844
Hey, it's me.

524
00:39:05,011 --> 00:39:06,929
Another perfect day in paradise out here.

525
00:39:07,138 --> 00:39:08,723
I'm in the pool.

526
00:39:09,265 --> 00:39:11,851
Okay, call me.

527
00:39:26,866 --> 00:39:29,368
- Hi, how are you?
- Hey, babe, did you get lunch?

528
00:39:29,535 --> 00:39:30,995
- I did.
- Ha-ha.

529
00:39:31,162 --> 00:39:33,831
- I think I'm burning up back here.
- Oh, really?

530
00:39:33,998 --> 00:39:37,209
- You're just in luck. Look what I have.
- Oh, hey, great.

531
00:39:41,047 --> 00:39:43,007
- You're all red back here.
- Yeah.

532
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,468
I feel stupid.

533
00:39:46,802 --> 00:39:48,429
I told you not to spend
so much time in the sun.

534
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:50,389
You don't listen.

535
00:39:51,766 --> 00:39:53,225
Yeah, it's me again.

536
00:39:53,434 --> 00:39:57,897
Listen, as I speak,
not 25 feet away from me...

537
00:39:58,105 --> 00:40:00,649
...I'm looking at the mark.

538
00:40:00,816 --> 00:40:04,570
Think Thurston Howell III
if he shacked up with Ginger.

539
00:40:04,737 --> 00:40:06,614
He's dripping in Gucci.

540
00:40:06,781 --> 00:40:08,491
It's like I'm at the watering hole...

541
00:40:08,657 --> 00:40:11,452
...and I'm watching the fattest,
slowest water buffalo...

542
00:40:11,619 --> 00:40:15,956
...expose his neck to me,
and I'm the lioness ready to strike.

543
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:19,710
Come, Kim, join me.

544
00:40:19,919 --> 00:40:22,338
Join the pride.

545
00:40:25,591 --> 00:40:29,929
I said "lioness" because it's the females
who do all the hunting.

546
00:40:30,763 --> 00:40:32,598
I just wanted to be species-accurate...

547
00:40:32,765 --> 00:40:36,018
...irrespective of my own sex,
it's a <i>National Geographic</i> thing.

548
00:40:36,227 --> 00:40:37,728
Anyway...

549
00:40:37,937 --> 00:40:39,688
...get out here.

550
00:40:40,064 --> 00:40:41,357
Bye.

551
00:41:24,775 --> 00:41:25,943
Santa Fe, New Mexico.

552
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:29,989
I need the number of a law firm,
Davis & Main.

553
00:41:30,739 --> 00:41:32,992
Yeah, you can connect me.

554
00:43:11,632 --> 00:43:15,052
There are a few options
on the company cars.

555
00:43:15,261 --> 00:43:17,429
We can arrange a test drive
whenever you'd like.

556
00:43:17,596 --> 00:43:19,390
Company car, wow.

557
00:43:19,598 --> 00:43:23,060
And there's a service that will deliver it
right to you, wherever you want.

558
00:43:23,227 --> 00:43:26,897
And if you find you're not happy with it,
it's not a big deal to change it out.

559
00:43:27,064 --> 00:43:29,358
That sounds really, uh....

560
00:43:29,942 --> 00:43:31,360
Yeah.

561
00:43:39,326 --> 00:43:41,495
This is interesting.

562
00:43:41,704 --> 00:43:45,332
Oh, if this isn't to your taste...

563
00:43:45,499 --> 00:43:48,585
...we have a collection of art in-house
you can choose from.

564
00:43:48,752 --> 00:43:52,131
Any time you're ready, I can put together
some samples for you to review.

565
00:43:52,298 --> 00:43:54,425
I-- I-- I like this.

566
00:43:54,633 --> 00:43:59,179
Good. Well, any other needs you have,
I'm here to help.

567
00:43:59,388 --> 00:44:01,515
Office supplies, dietary needs.

568
00:44:01,724 --> 00:44:04,685
Anything special
you want stocked in the fridge?

569
00:44:05,102 --> 00:44:06,979
Maybe a humidifier?

570
00:44:07,146 --> 00:44:10,649
- Gets kind of dry in here.
- Omar, I'm pretty low maintenance.

571
00:44:10,816 --> 00:44:16,238
Sure. Well, if there's anything you need,
I'm right outside the door.

572
00:44:16,822 --> 00:44:20,701
- Great. If I think of anything.
- Okay.

573
00:44:23,037 --> 00:44:24,038
Hey, do you think...?

574
00:44:25,289 --> 00:44:26,790
I'm just looking at this.

575
00:44:26,999 --> 00:44:29,501
Do we get a choice of desks?

576
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:31,045
What were you thinking?

577
00:44:32,796 --> 00:44:35,466
Is it possible...?

578
00:44:36,175 --> 00:44:39,428
Can we do a cocobolo?

579
00:44:39,636 --> 00:44:41,263
Cocobolo desk?

580
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:44,016
Absolutely. I'll get right on that.
