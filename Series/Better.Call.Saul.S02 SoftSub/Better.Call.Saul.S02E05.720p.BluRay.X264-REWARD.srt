1
00:00:59,853 --> 00:01:01,855
- Wonderful.
- Are the leeks too overpowering?

2
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:04,941
Not at all. That's as good
as the one we had in Florence.

3
00:01:05,108 --> 00:01:07,944
- All right, don't humour me.
- I'm not.

4
00:01:08,695 --> 00:01:11,614
How was rehearsal?
Did what's her name behave herself?

5
00:01:11,781 --> 00:01:15,452
She takes the whole section for granted.
I'm debating whether to say something.

6
00:01:15,618 --> 00:01:19,414
I think you should. Absolutely.
Don't keep it inside.

7
00:01:19,581 --> 00:01:22,792
- Ready for the chiffonade?
- Yeah, thanks.

8
00:01:25,003 --> 00:01:27,088
After all,
if she's compromising the work....

9
00:01:27,255 --> 00:01:31,551
Hmm. Well, it's debatable. I mean,
the Schubert is coming along nicely.

10
00:01:31,718 --> 00:01:33,928
- It's more about morale.
- Mm-hm.

11
00:01:34,429 --> 00:01:36,556
Morale can affect quality.

12
00:01:36,848 --> 00:01:40,268
God knows the hoops that Howard jumps
through to keep the troops humming.

13
00:01:40,435 --> 00:01:42,020
True.

14
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:50,445
- You deserve a medal for this.
- Please, it's no big deal.

15
00:01:53,656 --> 00:01:57,285
- Your soy ginger marinade.
- I found a citrus one that looked good...

16
00:01:57,452 --> 00:01:59,078
...so I thought I would try that.

17
00:01:59,913 --> 00:02:02,415
Well, anyway, you are a trouper.

18
00:02:02,582 --> 00:02:04,876
I apologise in advance.

19
00:02:05,043 --> 00:02:07,879
Let's just say he's something
of an acquired taste.

20
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,423
Oh, how bad can he be?

21
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:15,136
Just in case, let's have a high sign.
How about the old Carol Burnett thing?

22
00:02:15,345 --> 00:02:18,306
- Oh, where she pulls her earlobe?
- Yeah, exactly.

23
00:02:18,473 --> 00:02:22,811
You do this and I'll say I have
briefs to read, and we'll get rid of him.

24
00:02:23,019 --> 00:02:24,604
All right, whatever you want.

25
00:02:24,771 --> 00:02:28,608
You know why she did that?
Carol Burnett? It's a great story.

26
00:02:28,775 --> 00:02:31,277
It was a signal to her grandmother,
who raised her--

27
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:34,656
Seriously?

28
00:02:34,823 --> 00:02:36,950
- He's early. You're a doll.
- Hm.

29
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,249
- Holy shit. Look at this place.
- Hey, Jimmy. Thanks for coming.

30
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:46,417
- Bring it on in here.
- Heh, heh.

31
00:02:47,335 --> 00:02:51,297
Oh, yeah.
Hey, a little taste of home for you.

32
00:02:51,464 --> 00:02:54,133
I had to look all over town
to find a place that had it.

33
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,303
- Didn't have time to wrap it.
- Well, thanks.

34
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:04,394
You're good.

35
00:03:04,561 --> 00:03:06,145
Yeah.

36
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:09,858
I'm looking for a place.

37
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:13,027
I've been staying at the Ramada.
Thanks for the help, by the way.

38
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:14,571
I found a few that I like.

39
00:03:14,737 --> 00:03:17,407
There's one place,
the Beachcomber, it has a pool.

40
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:20,743
And since the McGill clan
is whiter than a pack of albino rats....

41
00:03:21,369 --> 00:03:24,497
Figure I better work on my tan.
Seriously considering that option.

42
00:03:24,664 --> 00:03:30,420
I strongly suggest sunscreen.
We're up about 5000 feet here, you'll fry.

43
00:03:30,587 --> 00:03:32,505
Excellent point. Sunscreen.

44
00:03:33,506 --> 00:03:34,799
Check.

45
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,845
So...

46
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:41,514
...a violinist?

47
00:03:41,764 --> 00:03:46,561
And according to Chuck,
a crazy talented one at that.

48
00:03:46,853 --> 00:03:48,354
I mean, wow.

49
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:50,648
No, Chuck is very gracious.

50
00:03:50,815 --> 00:03:52,358
She's being modest.

51
00:03:52,525 --> 00:03:55,403
Rebecca is widely respected
amongst her peers.

52
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,405
Yo-Yo Ma came to our wedding.

53
00:03:57,989 --> 00:03:59,574
That's....

54
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:01,576
Right on, man.

55
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:05,163
About the wedding...

56
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:08,166
...I've been meaning to apologise
about that.

57
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:11,961
- I am truly sorry. I wasn't--
- No worries.

58
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,796
Please.

59
00:04:17,342 --> 00:04:20,637
So tell us about your first week
at Hamlin Hamlin McGill.

60
00:04:20,803 --> 00:04:22,138
It was great.

61
00:04:22,597 --> 00:04:25,391
I mean, they got me
working in the mailroom, which--

62
00:04:25,558 --> 00:04:27,560
You gotta start somewhere.

63
00:04:27,727 --> 00:04:31,356
I learned how to use the Xerox machine,
which is surprisingly complicated.

64
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:35,818
I mean, press a button,
a piece of paper spits out. Not anymore.

65
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:39,405
The thing is practically a computer.
It's like a goddamn space shuttle.

66
00:04:39,614 --> 00:04:43,242
It's got, like, double-sided printing,
automatic stapling, you know.

67
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:48,498
Mm. I met some nice folks,
guys and gals.

68
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:53,503
Well, gal, singular, actually.

69
00:04:53,962 --> 00:04:56,923
I learned everyone's name
and I licked a ton of stamps.

70
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:01,219
My tongue is like hamburger meat.
I mean, seriously.

71
00:05:01,636 --> 00:05:03,346
Ahh. Ah?

72
00:05:03,513 --> 00:05:05,556
It got-- The thing is raw as hell.

73
00:05:05,723 --> 00:05:09,018
Then I found out
there's a sponge for that. Oops.

74
00:05:09,185 --> 00:05:10,895
Rookie mistake. Ha-ha.

75
00:05:11,062 --> 00:05:13,439
Well, it sounds like you had
a very productive week.

76
00:05:13,606 --> 00:05:15,942
Yeah. It was really great.

77
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:20,488
Hey, guys. Um....

78
00:05:22,532 --> 00:05:24,534
I wanna thank you for having me over.

79
00:05:24,701 --> 00:05:29,038
This is like the best meal
I've had in a decade.

80
00:05:29,205 --> 00:05:32,125
I mean, the fish is perfection.
And the....

81
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,503
- Risotto.
- Risotto.

82
00:05:36,421 --> 00:05:40,425
- Thank you. That was very kind.
- Well, you're a wonderful chef.

83
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:43,970
You know, aside from being
super talented with the:

84
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:48,558
Yeah. You got a good one, Chuck.
I mean, lucky, lucky man.

85
00:05:48,725 --> 00:05:50,810
Well, cheers to that.

86
00:05:55,648 --> 00:05:58,067
Ahem.

87
00:05:58,609 --> 00:05:59,944
Pardon me.

88
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:13,875
All right.

89
00:06:15,418 --> 00:06:19,338
What's the difference between a vacuum
cleaner and a lawyer on a motorcycle?

90
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:22,592
The vacuum cleaner
has the dirt bag on the inside.

91
00:06:24,302 --> 00:06:25,678
Ha, ha. Lawyer jokes.

92
00:06:25,845 --> 00:06:28,639
Been in the mailroom a week
and I've heard maybe a hundred.

93
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:32,185
- It all comes from a place of affection.
- Sure. Of course.

94
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:35,104
What do you get when you cross
The Godfather with a lawyer?

95
00:06:35,271 --> 00:06:37,815
An offer you can't understand.

96
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:39,984
- Very clever.
- Never heard that one.

97
00:06:40,151 --> 00:06:43,905
And believe me, I have nothing but
the utmost respect for your profession.

98
00:06:44,072 --> 00:06:45,615
I mean, it's the pillar of-- Oh.

99
00:06:45,782 --> 00:06:48,076
Why do they bury lawyers
under 20 feet of dirt?

100
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:50,787
Because deep down,
they're really good people.

101
00:06:52,205 --> 00:06:54,874
Oh. What do you call a lawyer
with an IQ of 60?

102
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:58,544
"Your Honour." What's the difference
between a tick and a lawyer?

103
00:06:58,711 --> 00:07:01,255
- Oh, no.
- The tick falls off when you're dead.

104
00:07:01,464 --> 00:07:05,802
Bam! Love that one. You like that?
Ha-ha. Just joking.

105
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:08,638
I want you to know
how seriously I take my job.

106
00:07:08,805 --> 00:07:10,139
I-- The--

107
00:07:10,306 --> 00:07:11,766
Grateful for the-- Oh.

108
00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:15,686
How many lawyers does it take to
change a lightbulb? Classic setup here.

109
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:16,854
Three.

110
00:07:17,021 --> 00:07:21,109
One to climb the ladder, one to shake it
and one to sue the ladder company.

111
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:25,613
- Comedy gold.
- I'm here all night!

112
00:07:25,822 --> 00:07:29,200
- More. Go, go.
- Okay, okay, okay.

113
00:07:29,367 --> 00:07:30,368
Dessert, anyone?

114
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:33,329
We have a homemade blueberry crumble
with vanilla ice cream.

115
00:07:33,496 --> 00:07:37,041
Yeah. Blueberry crumble, sounds terrific.
I love a fruit-based blueberry--

116
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,460
- Wait, I think I know one.
- Bring it on.

117
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:43,464
Yeah, yeah. What do lawyers
and sperm have in common?

118
00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:45,133
- Oh, just--
- Um....

119
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:47,760
Three million-- No, wait.

120
00:07:47,927 --> 00:07:49,762
One in three million have--

121
00:07:49,929 --> 00:07:52,390
A chance of becoming a human being.

122
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,436
Love that one.

123
00:08:05,278 --> 00:08:07,155
Well, that went well. Don't you think?

124
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:08,614
Sure.

125
00:08:08,948 --> 00:08:10,408
Thanks again.

126
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:14,912
I don't know what you were
worried about. Jimmy's great.

127
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:18,082
Yeah. No, he's....

128
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,251
Yeah.

129
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:24,505
So, what's going on tomorrow?

130
00:08:25,256 --> 00:08:27,758
I've got the Gurnstetter deposition
at 10.

131
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:29,886
Back-to-back partner meetings
after lunch.

132
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:31,679
It shouldn't be a late one.

133
00:08:33,181 --> 00:08:35,183
Thought any more
about what's her name?

134
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,476
It's your reputation too, you know?

135
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:39,770
Well, we start the Tchaikovsky
on Monday.

136
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:43,065
So I'll see what kind of mood she's in
when we wrap.

137
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:44,609
Smart.

138
00:08:51,157 --> 00:08:55,203
What do you call 25 attorneys
buried up to their chins in cement?

139
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:59,498
- Not enough cement.
- What?

140
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,544
Oh. Oh, oh.

141
00:09:55,513 --> 00:09:58,266
<i>Hello, you've
reached the voicemail of Kim Wexler.</i>

142
00:09:58,474 --> 00:10:01,727
<i>Please leave me a message,
and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.</i>

143
00:10:01,936 --> 00:10:03,020
It's me again.

144
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:06,023
Think I found something
that could help get you out of there.

145
00:10:06,232 --> 00:10:08,150
I'm gonna make things right.

146
00:10:08,818 --> 00:10:10,820
Call me, would you?

147
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,257
- Hi.
- Whoa.

148
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:33,634
Sorry, I didn't mean
to sneak up on you.

149
00:10:34,135 --> 00:10:36,053
I just thought everyone was gone.

150
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,639
Nope. I'm here late most nights.

151
00:10:40,016 --> 00:10:43,811
By the way, I noticed in your office...

152
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:45,563
...you threw away a soda can.

153
00:10:46,147 --> 00:10:47,565
You going through my trash?

154
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:51,402
No. I was just dropping off papers
at lunchtime and I happened to notice it...

155
00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:52,611
...in your trashcan.

156
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:56,324
I fished it out, so it's fine.
Office cans are for recyclable paper.

157
00:10:56,532 --> 00:10:59,702
There's a separate big can
for plastic, glass and aluminium.

158
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,871
We take our ecological footprint
seriously.

159
00:11:02,038 --> 00:11:06,125
Okay, so the big can is where
I should throw my empty Scotch bottles?

160
00:11:06,584 --> 00:11:11,672
Heh. No, I get it. Go green. Good.

161
00:11:11,881 --> 00:11:14,633
- Was there anything else?
- Yeah, one quick thing.

162
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,721
I have the brief you gave Cliff. Plaintiff's
opposition to the defendant's motion.

163
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:21,265
I have a few notes.
I think they're pretty clear...

164
00:11:21,432 --> 00:11:24,018
...but it's probably easier
if we go over them together.

165
00:11:24,185 --> 00:11:27,396
- Jesus, those are Cliff's?
- No, they're my notes.

166
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:29,899
I'd love to go over them now,
if you have a minute.

167
00:11:30,066 --> 00:11:33,069
It looks worse than it is.
We just have a particular house style.

168
00:11:33,444 --> 00:11:36,572
Okay, no offence, but you're
a second-year associate, right?

169
00:11:36,781 --> 00:11:39,200
- Yep.
- And I came in as a fourth-year.

170
00:11:39,367 --> 00:11:40,451
That's right.

171
00:11:40,618 --> 00:11:44,121
So why is a second-year
giving notes to a fourth-year?

172
00:11:44,455 --> 00:11:47,166
Well, like I said, I know the house style.

173
00:11:49,085 --> 00:11:52,713
- Does Cliff have you babysitting me?
- No.

174
00:11:53,005 --> 00:11:55,883
This is just one associate
helping another.

175
00:11:56,092 --> 00:12:00,513
Like here, the Roman numeral headings,
we use all caps for those.

176
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:03,265
And you indented them,
which is perfectly fine...

177
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:04,975
...but Cliff likes them centred.

178
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:08,604
And before I forget, we put two spaces
after a period on all our documents.

179
00:12:08,771 --> 00:12:10,564
I know it seems like a minor thing...

180
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:12,733
...but it looks
so much cleaner on the page.

181
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:15,111
You went a tad overboard
with the quotations.

182
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:19,031
It's okay to present a quote from a legal
opinion, but when you use too many...

183
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:21,492
...it gives the impression
you don't know...

184
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:25,162
...how to write an argument of your own.
Heh, I'm sure you do, so....

185
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:28,457
You have a tendency to overuse
the words "clearly" and "obviously."

186
00:12:28,624 --> 00:12:32,711
- Again, it's a matter of personal opinion--
- I really appreciate this, Erin.

187
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:35,464
But I was just on my way out.

188
00:12:35,631 --> 00:12:38,926
So if we could continue this
first thing tomorrow morning?

189
00:12:39,135 --> 00:12:43,013
Well, I was thinking we should just get
her done now. No time like the present.

190
00:12:45,099 --> 00:12:46,100
Sure.

191
00:12:46,267 --> 00:12:49,395
Let's roll up our sleeves
and apply a little elbow grease.

192
00:12:49,562 --> 00:12:52,064
- Great.
- So I'm gonna get my favourite pen.

193
00:12:52,231 --> 00:12:56,360
- And I will see you momentarily.
- You got it.

You can call me Kim.

202
00:13:50,289 --> 00:13:53,167
Kim, it's 20 to midnight.

203
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,838
Are you asking me if you can leave?

204
00:13:59,215 --> 00:14:03,052
Guys, I'm not your supervisor.
Don't stick around on my account.

205
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:12,144
You coming, Kim?

00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:15,231

Hey. Again, thanks.

215
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:58,125
Hey, Gesualdo.

216
00:15:58,334 --> 00:16:01,837
- Could you skip vacuuming tonight?
- Hey.

217
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:05,424
Five minutes. Give me five minutes.
Here's how we're gonna handle...

218
00:16:05,591 --> 00:16:08,177
...this travesty of justice.

219
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:17,311
<i>Wexler v. Hamlin Hamlin McGill.</i>
You want me to sue my own firm?

220
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,523
The filing's all typed up. It's ready to go.
This is not my area of expertise.

221
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:25,486
All right? So the first order of business,
we get a great employment law attorney.

222
00:16:25,653 --> 00:16:27,029
Show them we mean business.

223
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:29,406
Come on.

224
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:31,158
Hey, look at you. Okay?

225
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:34,578
You're here at midnight
in this glorified cellblock...

226
00:16:34,745 --> 00:16:36,497
...busting your ass for what?

227
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:39,667
It has nothing to do with your
performance. You're being mistreated.

228
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:42,419
Chuck is punishing you to get to me.

229
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:44,672
This is extortion, pure and simple.

230
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:48,092
No, that's Howard,
who has an image to uphold.

231
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:51,970
He did the same thing after the Kettleman
fiasco and Chuck was nowhere in sight.

232
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:56,016
- I'm telling you, Chuck is behind this.
- No, you are behind this.

233
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:59,144
I told you this would happen,
and now I'm paying the price.

234
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:02,189
I should have known better.

235
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:05,859
So now I'm keeping my head down
and I'm getting through this.

236
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:09,071
And I'm most certainly not suing HHM.

237
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:13,617
- Kim--
- Even if I won, who would hire me?

238
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:15,452
That would be career suicide.

239
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:17,454
All right.

240
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:21,875
- Then I quit Davis & Main.
- What does that accomplish?

241
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:23,961
It's the only way
to get you out of Dutch.

242
00:17:24,128 --> 00:17:28,006
Because this is about Chuck,
whether you wanna believe it or not.

243
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:30,634
I give him what he wants,
he lets up on you.

244
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:33,387
Wow, my knight in shining armour.

245
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:38,434
That is some sacrifice, quitting a job that
you've been trying to tank since day one.

246
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,852
That's not true.

247
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:42,604
I dig myself out of this hole.

248
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:45,649
You do your job, Jimmy.

249
00:17:45,858 --> 00:17:47,234
Prove you can go one week--

250
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:52,823
Hell, one day without breaking the rules
of the New Mexico Bar Association...

251
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:54,616
...or pissing off your boss.

252
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:58,871
And don't insult my intelligence by saying
you are doing any of this for me.

253
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:03,167
You don't save me.

254
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:06,336
I save me.

255
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:10,799
Just please go.

256
00:18:26,315 --> 00:18:28,650
Oh, yes, Mr. Simmons,
I'll transfer you.

257
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:35,657
Hey. Is Erin in yet?

258
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,752
Goddamn pixie ninja.

259
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:49,129
<i>I owe you a big apology.</i>

260
00:18:50,506 --> 00:18:53,133
I have a medical condition.

261
00:18:53,342 --> 00:18:56,303
GERD.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

262
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:01,517
I know, it's a mouthful, right?
It affects the lower oesophageal sphincter.

263
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:05,479
I took a risk yesterday at lunch
with some onion rings, and last night--

264
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:08,148
- Are we doing this or not?
- You bet.

265
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:17,324
<i>Hey, Jerry, it's Kim Wexler.</i>

266
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:19,868
<i>How's things with the alumni group?</i>

267
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:24,832
Top 50? Ha-ha-ha. Go, UNM Law.
Hey, I'm wondering if you've heard...

268
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:27,960
...that Santa Fe Place
is looking for new outside counsel.

269
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:31,880
They should really be considering
Hamlin Hamlin McGill. We--

270
00:19:32,631 --> 00:19:37,219
Huh. It must have just been a rumour.
Yeah, let's grab a drink soon.

271
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:40,305
You too. Okay, bye.

272
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,730
I remember you mentioned your brother
worked in Intel's Legal Department.

273
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:50,649
I'm an attorney
at Hamlin Hamlin McGill.

274
00:19:50,816 --> 00:19:52,568
Would you know if Intel is happy...

275
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:54,444
...with their legal representation?

276
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:59,157
That's flattering,
but I'm seeing someone at the moment.

277
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:00,659
So you know what?

278
00:20:00,826 --> 00:20:03,287
Just call the main number
and they'll find me.

279
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:09,376
Yeah, no,
we had drinks a few days ago...

280
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:13,088
...and she said you had a friend who--
Oh, so they already settled?

281
00:20:13,422 --> 00:20:15,841
I heard you ended up at Harvard Law.

282
00:20:16,884 --> 00:20:20,012
Yeah, yeah. She was my roommate.

283
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,015
Listen, I'm an attorney
at Hamlin Hamlin McGill.

284
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:27,060
We're actually known for teaming
with other firms on large contracts.

285
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:30,522
Schweikart? Sure.
Yeah, I know them well. It's a great firm.

286
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:33,400
<i>We met at that ABA mixer last year.</i>

287
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:35,277
Yep. Bourbon shots.

288
00:20:35,444 --> 00:20:38,488
That was me. Well, congrats
on landing the Honeywell contract.

289
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:40,949
<i>Huge amount of work. You too.</i>

290
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:01,720
- How was your lunch?
- Good.

291
00:21:01,887 --> 00:21:04,598
- What'd you have?
- A turkey wrap.

292
00:21:20,072 --> 00:21:21,073
<i>How's the place?</i>

293
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:26,203
<i>It's great. It's safe, quiet.
They allow dogs.</i>

294
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,413
<i>We can't ask for more than that.</i>

295
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:30,374
I can't get Kaylee out of the pool.

296
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,793
By the end of the day, she's a prune.

297
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,253
<i>Ha-ha. I'm glad she's enjoying it.</i>

298
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:38,090
Hey, I better get her dinner
started soon.

299
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:39,299
<i>Go to the restaurant.</i>

300
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:41,885
No, it's too expensive.
I have groceries in the room.

301
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:45,305
<i>Don't worry about that. Take her out.</i>

302
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:47,557
Thanks, Mike.

303
00:21:49,101 --> 00:21:50,227
She misses you.

304
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:53,814
<i>- You think you might come by later?</i>
- No, not yet.

305
00:21:53,981 --> 00:21:57,109
I don't want her to see me
looking like this.

306
00:21:57,317 --> 00:21:59,236
<i>How bad was it?</i>

307
00:21:59,403 --> 00:22:03,156
Well, I can tell you
the next car I get's gonna have airbags.

308
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:06,451
Well, whenever you feel you're ready....

309
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,829
It's okay, it looks worse than it is.

310
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:10,831
You give Kaylee a kiss for me.

311
00:22:10,998 --> 00:22:13,750
<i>- I will.</i>
- All right. Bye, darling.

312
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:20,048
Whoa. Hold up.
What the hell happened to you?

313
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,677
I get it.
The first rule of Fight Club, right?

314
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:27,014
Let me introduce you.
This is my babysitter, Erin.

315
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,434
Erin, this is my grandpa, Mike.

316
00:22:30,976 --> 00:22:32,561
Nice to meet you.

317
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:47,367
- Thanks, Tim.
- Good seeing you, Jimmy.

318
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:51,121
Listen, this clerk and I go way back.
We're like this:

319
00:22:51,288 --> 00:22:53,707
But she needs a little finessing,
so can I handle it?

320
00:22:53,874 --> 00:22:55,167
Yeah, sure.

321
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:58,795
Surprise. I bet you never thought
you'd see me again.

322
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:00,005
Mm-hm.

323
00:23:00,172 --> 00:23:04,676
I need a summary judgement hearing
with Buschelles for <i>Bray v. O'Connell.</i>

324
00:23:04,843 --> 00:23:08,722
And I'm hoping for Thursday at 10
before he, uh:

325
00:23:10,932 --> 00:23:13,727
- Don't have it.
- Thursday at noon, perhaps?

326
00:23:13,935 --> 00:23:15,437
Nope.

327
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:18,523
Thursday at 2?
Now, that's my final--

328
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:28,950
You're pretty.
Will you be my new mommy?

329
00:23:30,952 --> 00:23:32,829
What are you doing?

330
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:36,583
- What?
- That's a bribe.

331
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:39,461
It's a gift. That's how it works here.

332
00:23:39,628 --> 00:23:41,922
Grease the wheels of justice. Give me--

333
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:46,259
That's not how it works. You submit
the paperwork and you get a date, period.

334
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:49,304
What don't you understand
about finessing?

335
00:23:54,392 --> 00:23:57,813
I apologise for my colleague,
she's new.

336
00:23:57,979 --> 00:24:02,067
Is there any possible way
we could still get Thursday?

337
00:24:02,234 --> 00:24:04,611
I'll give you 2:30 Thursday...

338
00:24:04,986 --> 00:24:06,029
...the 14th.

339
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:07,531
That's next month.

340
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:13,495
We'll take it.

341
00:24:17,582 --> 00:24:20,544
So does this go
on my official Stasi report?

342
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:24,131
I'm not trying to get you in trouble.
I'm trying to keep you out of it.

343
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:26,174
I'm gonna hit the men's room.

344
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:28,593
The men's room.

345
00:24:29,344 --> 00:24:32,180
He posted. Posted bail.

346
00:24:43,692 --> 00:24:45,652
Hey, how you doing, Bill?

347
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:48,155
How am I doing? How are you?

348
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:49,698
You know, hanging in.

349
00:24:49,865 --> 00:24:52,367
Word on the street is
you're over at Davis & Main now.

350
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:53,994
Lucky son of a bitch.

351
00:24:54,578 --> 00:24:56,955
You know, dancing with the devil.

352
00:24:57,164 --> 00:25:00,292
- How are things at the district attorney--?
- Davis & Main.

353
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:02,252
Man, that must be sweet.

354
00:25:03,044 --> 00:25:04,671
They give you a car? Bet they did.

355
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:07,507
- Yeah, they gave me a car.
- What kind?

356
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:10,385
- It's a--
- No, don't tell me. I don't wanna know.

357
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,639
I bet it's German. Is it German?

358
00:25:14,931 --> 00:25:17,684
Yeah, it's German.
The cup holders actually--

359
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:21,271
So you got a sick office?
I bet you have a sick office.

360
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:23,106
It's pretty sick.

361
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:25,984
- It's got a little fireplace--
- Fireplace?

362
00:25:26,151 --> 00:25:28,195
I'd kill my mother for a fireplace.

363
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:30,822
Hell, I'd kill her for a window.

364
00:25:32,032 --> 00:25:33,825
You-- You have an assistant, right?

365
00:25:33,992 --> 00:25:36,745
Don't tell me. Is she hot?
She's hot, right?

366
00:25:36,953 --> 00:25:39,247
She is a bright young man
named Omar.

367
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:41,958
Omar.

368
00:25:42,209 --> 00:25:44,419
Hey, you got a little something
on your, uh....

369
00:25:45,629 --> 00:25:47,631
- Unh. Yep.
- Yeah.

370
00:25:47,797 --> 00:25:50,050
That's vomit. Again.

371
00:25:50,217 --> 00:25:53,929
The worst part? It could have come
from two different defendants.

372
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:58,016
Scumbags. They're all scumbags.

373
00:25:58,183 --> 00:26:00,227
God, where are you living?
They put you up?

374
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:02,687
It's a corporate apartment. It's just--

375
00:26:02,854 --> 00:26:04,648
Don't tell me.

376
00:26:04,814 --> 00:26:06,942
Ha-ha. Christ.

377
00:26:08,485 --> 00:26:12,781
Damn it, I gotta run. I'm putting away
some brain-dead suckwad...

378
00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:14,699
...who tried to rob a library.

379
00:26:15,158 --> 00:26:17,786
Good seeing you, Bill.
Have a great day.

380
00:26:17,953 --> 00:26:19,829
Yeah. Yeah.

381
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:22,415
Lucky bastard.

382
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:46,231
Hello. Hi, this is Kim Wexler.

383
00:26:46,815 --> 00:26:49,693
I did leave a message, and I was just--

384
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:52,696
Yes, ma'am.

385
00:26:53,321 --> 00:26:54,823
Sorry to bother you.

386
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:08,878
Hi, this is Kim Wexler.
I was looking for Carolyn Lipitz.

387
00:27:09,087 --> 00:27:11,464
No, not his secretary. I'm an attorney.

388
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:13,967
Yes, I did. I got your number from Chris.

389
00:27:14,134 --> 00:27:15,593
Sure, I will let them know.

390
00:27:15,927 --> 00:27:18,555
Okay. Nope, got it. Totally understand.

391
00:27:18,763 --> 00:27:22,100
This is Kim Wexler
from Hamlin Hamlin McGill....

392
00:27:22,517 --> 00:27:25,353
Ahem. Actually-- Hi. Can I just--

393
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,939
Would you tell him
I'll call him right back?

394
00:27:37,032 --> 00:27:39,284
<i>Okay, just let me know
when is a good time.</i>

395
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:47,125
Got it.

396
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:50,920
Okay. Thanks for your time.

397
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:01,681
Hi, Claudia. Kim Wexler.

398
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:03,850
<i>I'll let him know.</i>

399
00:28:10,357 --> 00:28:14,110
<i>This is Kim Wexler.
I was looking for Jillian Cogan.</i>

400
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:19,366
<i>I met you last year at the ABA mixer.</i>

401
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:22,619
You know I have a fear of heights.

402
00:28:22,827 --> 00:28:23,953
Kids will keep coming every summer.

403
00:28:24,162 --> 00:28:27,207
All right, just give me a call. Great.

404
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:40,970
Kim Wexler. I did call yesterday.

405
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:43,181
Okay. I totally get it.

406
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:36,109
Kim Wexler.

407
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:37,861
Hey, how are you, Paige?

408
00:29:38,528 --> 00:29:40,029
You did?

409
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:47,412
That's-- Heh. That's so nice to hear.
I thought we hit it off as well.

410
00:29:49,956 --> 00:29:52,834
Really? I....

411
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:59,090
I-- I couldn't be more thrilled.
I mean, the firm and I.

412
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:02,010
Absolutely, I'll tell him right now.

413
00:30:02,177 --> 00:30:05,138
I'm sure we can get something
on the books tomorrow.

414
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:07,974
Day after, at the latest.

415
00:30:08,391 --> 00:30:11,686
Thank you, Paige. Me too.

416
00:30:12,562 --> 00:30:14,355
Okay, bye.

417
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:21,279
Yes!

418
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:48,473
- All right.
- Just follow my lead.

419
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:50,600
I will.

420
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:01,528
- There she is.
- Hi.

421
00:31:01,694 --> 00:31:04,322
- Paige, so good to see you.
- You too.

422
00:31:04,531 --> 00:31:06,783
Kim, this is Kevin Wachtell, our CEO.

423
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:09,202
- Kim Wexler. Great to meet you, Kevin.
- And you.

424
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:11,955
Paige, Kevin, this is Howard Hamlin,
our senior partner.

425
00:31:12,121 --> 00:31:13,248
- Pleasure.
- Likewise.

426
00:31:13,414 --> 00:31:16,459
We're thrilled to have you folks here.
Kevin, true story:

427
00:31:16,626 --> 00:31:19,671
When I was 7 years old, my first
bank account was at Mesa Verde...

428
00:31:19,837 --> 00:31:21,297
- ...if you believe it.
- I can.

429
00:31:21,464 --> 00:31:23,633
Mine was too.
Back when my dad ran the place.

430
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:26,803
Wow. I can remember the cover
of my first passbook.

431
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:28,596
- It was a silhouette of a--
- Cowboy.

432
00:31:28,805 --> 00:31:32,433
A cowboy on horseback, yes.
Standing next to a cactus.

433
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,643
I loved that cowboy.

434
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:36,229
Far as I was concerned,
I was saving for that horse.

435
00:31:36,396 --> 00:31:39,232
What the heck else is money good for
when you're 7 years old?

436
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:43,444
We have a little presentation for you
in our conference room...

437
00:31:43,611 --> 00:31:46,573
...along with snacks, and a soy milk latte
with your name on it.

438
00:31:46,739 --> 00:31:48,074
Oh, this one. She's a keeper.

439
00:31:48,283 --> 00:31:50,952
- Shall we?
- Let's do it.

440
00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:03,715
That couldn't have gone better.

441
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:05,800
- Pleasure to meet you.
- I'll see you soon.

442
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:08,720
- Thanks for setting this up.
- Talk to you.

443
00:32:09,971 --> 00:32:11,931
Lovely to meet you, Paige.

444
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:25,361
Whew.

445
00:32:27,697 --> 00:32:30,867
- Congratulations.
- Right back at you.

446
00:32:32,785 --> 00:32:35,121
I'll circle back with Paige.
Get the ball rolling.

447
00:32:35,288 --> 00:32:37,915
Start talking strategy, you know?
Maybe...

448
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:41,336
...put together a list of staff associates
we can put on this.

449
00:32:41,502 --> 00:32:43,630
I'll put Francis on that.

450
00:32:43,838 --> 00:32:46,507
You've got enough on your plate
in Doc Review.

451
00:33:11,032 --> 00:33:12,575
Coming.

452
00:33:16,788 --> 00:33:18,790
- Hey.
- Catch you at a bad time?

453
00:33:18,956 --> 00:33:20,958
Not at all. Come in.

454
00:33:25,129 --> 00:33:26,297
I hear clinking.

455
00:33:26,464 --> 00:33:29,425
Does that mean
we have something to celebrate?

456
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:31,469
We sure do.

457
00:33:40,603 --> 00:33:42,563
What are we drinking to?

458
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,982
Got a juicy one for you.

459
00:33:45,692 --> 00:33:46,984
Mesa Verde?

460
00:33:47,151 --> 00:33:49,487
- On retainer.
- Oh, even better.

461
00:33:52,448 --> 00:33:53,700
Congratulations.

462
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:56,202
One of your golf course conquests?

463
00:33:57,328 --> 00:33:59,122
Kim Wexler brought them in.

464
00:33:59,706 --> 00:34:03,793
Fourth-year associate
snags a quarter of a million in billings?

465
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,713
She's probably having
a couple of drinks herself.

466
00:34:07,422 --> 00:34:09,090
She's out of the doghouse, I assume.

467
00:34:10,842 --> 00:34:11,884
We'll see.

468
00:34:12,427 --> 00:34:13,886
Huh.

469
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:16,180
Hmm.

470
00:34:17,014 --> 00:34:20,977
Interstate expansion. It's a complex case.

471
00:34:21,144 --> 00:34:25,565
That's two, maybe three regulatory
commissions we'll be dealing with.

472
00:34:25,732 --> 00:34:29,610
Months of work for HHM. Maybe years.

473
00:35:21,329 --> 00:35:24,499
- Good morning, Rudolpho.
- Good morning, Mr. McGill.

474
00:36:07,917 --> 00:36:09,669
Oh, sorry.

475
00:36:11,921 --> 00:36:14,882
I didn't know anyone was here.

476
00:36:15,049 --> 00:36:17,260
I'm just dropping off
some Sandpiper stuff.

477
00:36:17,426 --> 00:36:18,928
You're in early.

478
00:36:19,554 --> 00:36:20,680
More like late.

479
00:36:23,558 --> 00:36:26,060
Well, regardless of the hour,
good to see you here.

480
00:36:26,227 --> 00:36:28,354
Yeah, I'm trying something new.

481
00:36:28,521 --> 00:36:30,314
Coming in and working until 9.

482
00:36:30,523 --> 00:36:32,525
It's easier before the place opens...

483
00:36:32,733 --> 00:36:36,404
...without all the lights
and the phones ringing.

484
00:36:37,989 --> 00:36:39,073
How about some coffee?

485
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:40,533
No, thank you.

486
00:36:41,742 --> 00:36:43,327
Would you mind making me some?

487
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:47,623
I apologise. It's just, I can't do it
myself...

488
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:50,001
...with the electricity.

489
00:36:52,211 --> 00:36:53,212
Sure.

490
00:36:53,379 --> 00:36:57,884
No sugar, just a splash of soy milk.
I think we have it.

491
00:37:01,053 --> 00:37:02,388
Kim?

492
00:37:02,638 --> 00:37:05,474
Um.... Make two cups.

493
00:37:20,823 --> 00:37:22,909
Well, I guess it's true what they say:

494
00:37:23,075 --> 00:37:25,077
The early bird gets the worm.

495
00:37:25,286 --> 00:37:26,871
Which is good, if you like worms.

496
00:37:36,213 --> 00:37:39,133
- May I ask you a question?
- Of course.

497
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,844
Do I have a future at this firm?

498
00:37:44,805 --> 00:37:47,183
We have a lot in common, you and I.

499
00:37:47,808 --> 00:37:50,394
My brother left you holding the bag.

500
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:54,941
If it makes you feel any better, you're not
the first person to go out on a limb for him.

501
00:37:55,149 --> 00:37:59,236
I made the same mistake,
over and over again.

502
00:37:59,445 --> 00:38:03,240
And now Howard has,
and he blames you.

503
00:38:06,452 --> 00:38:08,496
A damn mess.

504
00:38:13,167 --> 00:38:15,711
Jimmy ever tell you
anything about our father?

505
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,255
Not much, no.

506
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:24,512
My dad-- Our dad, he was...

507
00:38:25,596 --> 00:38:26,973
...well...

508
00:38:27,306 --> 00:38:30,810
...the personification of good.

509
00:38:31,227 --> 00:38:35,523
I'm not sure he could even
see sin in any form.

510
00:38:36,315 --> 00:38:38,776
Like he was born without the gene.

511
00:38:39,485 --> 00:38:41,862
He ran a little corner store in Cicero.

512
00:38:42,029 --> 00:38:44,615
Cigarettes behind the counter,
penny candy.

513
00:38:44,782 --> 00:38:48,411
Nothing special,
but it kept food on the table.

514
00:38:49,286 --> 00:38:52,039
And the neighbourhood loved Dad.

515
00:38:52,707 --> 00:38:56,544
He knew everybody's name,
what was going on in their lives.

516
00:38:57,753 --> 00:38:59,630
This little corner...

517
00:39:00,423 --> 00:39:02,174
...he made it better.

518
00:39:04,844 --> 00:39:07,054
I was named after him.

519
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:11,934
Before that, he worked for
a lot of people over the years...

520
00:39:12,101 --> 00:39:14,729
...and his dream was to be his own boss.

521
00:39:14,895 --> 00:39:18,107
He put everything he had
into that place.

522
00:39:18,816 --> 00:39:22,319
I was away at college
when he put Jimmy to work there.

523
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:27,158
Jimmy grew up in that store,
watching our father.

524
00:39:29,827 --> 00:39:32,288
But Dad was not
the world's greatest businessman...

525
00:39:32,455 --> 00:39:35,124
...and eventually he ran
into money troubles.

526
00:39:35,666 --> 00:39:40,254
I had a clerkship at the time, but I came
home to help him get his books in order...

527
00:39:40,421 --> 00:39:42,423
...set the ship straight.

528
00:39:42,882 --> 00:39:44,467
Now, I'm no accountant...

529
00:39:44,633 --> 00:39:51,015
...but I discovered $14,000
was just gone.

530
00:39:51,223 --> 00:39:53,434
Vanished over the years.

531
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:58,522
Turns out Jimmy had pilfered it
in dribs and drabs.

532
00:39:58,773 --> 00:40:01,442
Just took it out of the till.

533
00:40:04,403 --> 00:40:06,864
My dad wouldn't hear it.

534
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:08,699
Nope.

535
00:40:09,116 --> 00:40:11,118
Not his Jimmy.

536
00:40:14,205 --> 00:40:16,373
He ended up having to sell.

537
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:19,293
Six months later, he was dead.

538
00:40:21,003 --> 00:40:24,632
At the funeral, no one cried harder
than Jimmy.

539
00:40:32,848 --> 00:40:35,684
My brother is not a bad person.

540
00:40:36,393 --> 00:40:38,312
He has a good heart.

541
00:40:39,396 --> 00:40:41,023
It's just...

542
00:40:43,442 --> 00:40:45,653
...he can't help himself.

543
00:40:46,779 --> 00:40:49,782
And everyone's left picking up the pieces.

544
00:40:53,744 --> 00:40:55,454
Is there any coffee left?

545
00:40:55,704 --> 00:40:57,456
No, I got it.

546
00:41:02,211 --> 00:41:03,754
I'll talk to Howard.

547
00:41:03,921 --> 00:41:06,215
Pour a little oil on troubled waters.

548
00:41:06,382 --> 00:41:09,093
You're being wasted
down in Doc Review.

549
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,512
Good job with Mesa Verde.

550
00:41:54,638 --> 00:41:56,807
Mind if I join you?

551
00:42:00,394 --> 00:42:02,479
Hi. What can I get you?

552
00:42:02,646 --> 00:42:04,773
Coffee, black.

553
00:42:05,107 --> 00:42:06,859
Coming right up.

554
00:42:08,819 --> 00:42:10,487
Mm.

555
00:42:10,654 --> 00:42:13,908
He really did a number on you.

556
00:42:18,037 --> 00:42:19,997
Sorry, I know you?

557
00:42:20,539 --> 00:42:24,084
The young man who did that to you
is my nephew.

558
00:42:24,251 --> 00:42:26,378
Hothead. Always has been.

559
00:42:26,545 --> 00:42:28,297
He thinks he's a boxer.

560
00:42:29,089 --> 00:42:32,343
He should have shown you respect.

561
00:42:33,677 --> 00:42:39,975
I apologise to you
on behalf of my family.

562
00:42:42,228 --> 00:42:44,772
Apology accepted.

563
00:42:45,814 --> 00:42:48,984
And you know what?
He should go to jail.

564
00:42:49,151 --> 00:42:53,489
Best thing for him.
Teach him respect for his elders.

565
00:42:54,281 --> 00:42:58,327
But not for eight years.

566
00:42:58,494 --> 00:43:02,206
Less. Much less.

567
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,976
You see what I'm getting at?

568
00:43:22,184 --> 00:43:24,144
Not really.

569
00:43:24,311 --> 00:43:28,899
The gun charge, that's eight years
he's going away. Maybe 10.

570
00:43:29,066 --> 00:43:33,362
Aggravated assault, the gun,
plus he got your wallet.

571
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:35,364
That's right.

572
00:43:37,116 --> 00:43:42,454
I would like for you to tell the police
that the gun was yours.

573
00:43:42,621 --> 00:43:44,206
Would you?

574
00:43:45,291 --> 00:43:47,626
You're both a little
hot under the collar...

575
00:43:47,793 --> 00:43:50,254
...about whether you
bump his car or no...

576
00:43:50,421 --> 00:43:54,425
...but there was a scuffle
and he got your gun.

577
00:43:54,967 --> 00:43:56,010
My gun?

578
00:43:56,176 --> 00:43:58,721
Your gun from your pocket.

579
00:43:58,887 --> 00:44:03,058
He got it, and that's how
his prints got on it.

580
00:44:03,642 --> 00:44:06,270
And then I'd be subject
to the gun charge.

581
00:44:07,771 --> 00:44:10,107
You're an ex-cop.

582
00:44:10,274 --> 00:44:12,651
They go easy on you.

583
00:44:13,319 --> 00:44:15,195
So you're a psychic?

584
00:44:15,446 --> 00:44:20,242
I even twist Tuco's ear,
make him apologise.

585
00:44:20,659 --> 00:44:23,746
And he serves for battery.

586
00:44:23,996 --> 00:44:25,831
Nothing else.

587
00:44:29,543 --> 00:44:35,257
I'm looking for the best possible outcome
for everybody.

588
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:39,887
And for your trouble...

589
00:44:40,054 --> 00:44:43,849
...you take home $5000.

590
00:44:56,945 --> 00:44:58,655
Think about it.
