- Dad.
- Hey.

5
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:09,044
- What are you doing here?
- Well, I got an office here.

6
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:12,714
- You come down with Finn?
- And some people.

7
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,176
Promise me, no drinking and driving.

8
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:18,887
Who's your designated driver?

9
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:21,557
I'm not the one with all
the dents in their car.

10
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:24,393
All right. Have fun, huh?

11
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,353
You need some money?

12
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:30,732
Have a good time, sweetheart.
Be careful.

13
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:42,119
- You see Meadow?
- Yeah. I wish I knew she was here.

14
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,746
- I wonder what the fuck she's thinking.
- I'm sorry, Ton.

15
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:47,666
Some kid had a seizure upstairs.
It's been a horrible night.

16
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:51,587
Hey, Ton, Vito and Gene just called.
They're five minutes away.

17
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:54,923
All right. We're leaving. Here.

18
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,343
All right, call them and tell them
to meet us at Bud's Butter Bun...

19
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,846
...on Broadway and 18th.
All right.

20
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,273
Did I just see your father?

21
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,567
He's got an office here.

00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,611
Saturday night?

23
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,821
That's dedication.

24
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,866
The guy sure can put in the hours.

25
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,952
- Why not?
- Let's go someplace else.

26
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:27,623
Tony's spending so much time
at the club.

27
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,251
You think that might have
something to do with you?

28
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:36,924
If you think I'm gonna blow this guy for
your sick purposes, you are mistaken.

29
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,927
So go on about this phone call
the other night.

30

It was just some guy
with a Southern accent.

31

Christopher yelled at him
for calling the house.

32

- Said he'd see him down there.
- Down where?

33
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,188
Did you check the log on his cell?

34
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:55,067
Not since I almost got caught doing that,
and I am not doing it again.

35
00:03:55,235 --> 00:04:00,447
Wait till he goes into the shower.
See if there's a 404 or 336.

36
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,908
And memorize any other numbers
you don't recognize.

- I gotta go to the bathroom.

- I know, you said.
- No, I gotta go.

40

- Number two.
- I'll take you to your car.

41

This lidocaine didn't do much.

And we are...

00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:36,108
...done.

Jan, you wanna do your thing?

50
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,826
- Just keep a little pressure.
- All right.

51
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,954
I'm gonna get this down to the lab,
see what's what.

52
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:54,543
Okay. There we go.

53
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,879
- You okay?
- You think he got it all?

54
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:00,882
We hope so. Meantime,
there's a canteen on level L.

55
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,635
I'll let you know when
the results come back.

56
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,892
Does having a bowel movement
relieve the pain?

57
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,269
Yeah.

58
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:16,064
Would you describe the diarrhea
as loose or liquid?

59
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:19,735
Liquid. But this is getting so I'm afraid
to be away from the toilet.

60
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:22,404
I'm so scared
I'm gonna have an accident.

61

- No.

- How's your personal life?
- What do you mean?

64
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,256
Well, sometimes GI disturbances
are stress-related.

65
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:45,177
Is there anything unusual that
might be giving you the jim-jams?

I just want something for my stomach
so I can quit going to the bathroom.

at Adriana's club.

I gotta explain my business to you now?
After so many years?

74
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:17,042
- No, it's your life, Tony.
- Got that right.

75
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:19,628
What'd you do to your head?
Did you fall again?

76
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:23,632
Banged it on the medicine chest.
Don't worry about it. It's nothing.

the tests come back.

- I still gotta bring him a stool sample.
- Jesus, please.

00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,421
You yelled at me
to go to the doctor.

85

I gotta know every detail?

86
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,758

had colon cancer.

- Plus, they're gonna put me on Prozac.
- For diarrhea?

91
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:24,276
It's to help me cope and handle stress,
which is a lot of what causes it.

92

What do you got to be stressed about?
That bar?

93

- You see this?
- Yeah, I noticed that. What happened?

110
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,201
- It's cancer.
- What?

111

- Yeah, squamous.
- Oh, my God, that's terrible.

Hesh recommended him, naturally.

117
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:23,728
So this disease you got,
what causes it?

118
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,523
I did a Google on it,
and, like, the doctor too...

119
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,733
...they all say a lot
of it's psychological.

now I'm a headcase.

No. Come on. Stop blaming yourself.

Not that I blame him.

- My fucking tooth is killing me.

00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:59,324
Well, you should go back
to the dentist.

Why do you have to go?
Can't they drop the stuff off?

to be my number two.

of it's this father-figure thing, and...

going to establish limits and boundaries.

234

For example, you could tell her
she means a great deal to you...

235
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,857
...but you think of her as a daughter.

239

doing something you know is wrong...

and to the people you care about.

- You have to be honest with yourself.

you have to stay away from her.

"drop-dead gorgeous" about me...

249
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,708
...and how you had to have me.
