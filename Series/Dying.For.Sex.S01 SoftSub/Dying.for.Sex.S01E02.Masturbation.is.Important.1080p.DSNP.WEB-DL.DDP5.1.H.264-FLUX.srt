1
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,550
I did it.

2
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:10,677
I left Steve.

3
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:14,222
Fuck. Fuck. Where do I live?

4
00:00:14,223 --> 00:00:16,599
By getting divorced, am I just single?

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,227
Like, right now, am I
a single person with stage-four cancer?

6
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:21,812
Why would I do that?
Why would anyone do that? Fuck.

7
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:24,398
I'm just gonna head to my place,
and then we'll figure it out from there.

8
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:25,566
What's the plan?

9
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:28,487
I just wanna be touched by someone
who wants to touch me.

10
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:33,032
Is that crazy?

11
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,077
No. No, that is not crazy.

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,580
- Okay.
-  Yeah.

13
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,541
Fuck.

14
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:42,584
Okay.

15
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:44,502
- This is gonna be amazing.
-  Yeah.

16
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:46,254
-  Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
- Okay.

17
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:47,506
Yeah, this is good.

18
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,716
I have nothing with me.

19
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,261
- I can do this.
-  Mm-hmm.

20
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:55,012
Why did I wear overalls
this morning?

21
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:58,224
What kind of man wants to fuck a
woman with cancer who also wears overalls?

22
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:00,393
Okay.

23
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:01,978
Ignore that I'm crying.

24
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:04,689
This is... This is... This is good.

25
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,149
Okay.

26
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,069
You got it.

27
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,115
The air smells different.

28
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:25,460
Is this a sign?

29
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,964
Is this a sign from the universe?

30
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,555
Yes! Yes to everything
you were just acting out!

31
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:40,558
God, he's putting
so much effort into that.

32
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:42,269
Thank you.

33
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:13,133
About me.

34
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:16,678
I like music and the ocean?

35
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:19,306
No.

36
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:24,644
I'm a dirty, dirty slut
who likes windsurfing and pottery

37
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:27,105
and giving weird sad blow jobs.

38
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:30,317
No.

39
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:38,407
I'm 40, homeless, married,
can't feel my breasts, and I like trees?

40
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,159
Oh, my God.

41
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,792
- Hi.
- Hi.

42
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:48,626
Hi.

43
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:53,131
Okay. We know Nikki's not gonna
be able to take care of you, right?

44
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:57,343
I think she has
emotional problems.

45
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:58,637
No, she doesn't.

46
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,680
She's just loud.

47
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:03,684
Like, some undiagnosed form of adult ADHD.

48
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:08,229
She's never been
in a relationship for more than a year.

49
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,899
How do you know she's not gonna bail
when it gets hard?

50
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,818
Look, I know you guys have a thing.

51
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:18,739
Whatever that is, I understand the power
of female friendship.

52
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,325
I do. I know every word to Beaches.

53
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,035
You used to jerk off to Beaches.

54
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,371
Ha ha. No, I didn't.

55
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:26,498
Look...

56
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:32,921
The only reason she likes you is because
you never call her out on anything.

57
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,049
You know it, and I know it.

58
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,843
You're always just there
whenever she needs you.

59
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,431
That's... That's what this situation is.
Okay? I said it.

60
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:44,765
What is that? Is that--

61
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,059
That's a chode!

62
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:51,772
Hello?

63
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,482
I joined a dating app.

64
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:56,652
You're...
You're immunocompromised.

65
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:59,238
You can't do that.
You can't just go and have s--

66
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,199
You're gonna have sex with strangers?

67
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:05,161
This is what you do.
You... You run away. You disappear.

68
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,789
It's like I don't even know
who the fuck you are sometimes.

69
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,459
And, like, Nikki's not gonna be able
to take care of you.

70
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,545
She can't handle it, okay?
I said it. I said it.

71
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:17,257
She can't handle what's coming.

72
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:20,050
She's like... She's a child.

73
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,428
She just makes noises.
That's all she does.

74
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:26,390
Bad. Come, wait upon him.
Lead him to my bower.

75
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:30,144
The moon, methinks, methinks,

76
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:31,437
methinks...

77
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,939
- "Looks with a watery eye."
- No...  ...I got it. I got it.

78
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,276
The moon, methinks, methinks,
looks with a watery eye.

79
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,029
And when she weeps, weeps every little...

80
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,572
- Fuck me!
- Yeah, no, no. You got it.

81
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:43,324
"Every little" fuck me.

82
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:49,914
Did they forget about us?

83
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,749
Oh, no, this is what it's like.

84
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,460
You wait a half an hour to get called,
then you wait again in the room.

85
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:57,464
Like, 80% of having cancer is waiting.

86
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,426
Is this gonna make you late for rehearsal?

87
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,637
Mm-mmm. No, it's fine. I'll make it.

88
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,138
Okay, I don't want this
to mess up your life.

89
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,140
I want you to have time
for Noah and the play, and--

90
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,559
Yes. I will. It's not like
I'm solving world hunger.

91
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,229
I'm still living off the residuals
from a TV show

92
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,064
where I played Benjamin Franklin's whore.

93
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,232
You were so great in that.

94
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,484
Thank you.

95
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:24,824
God, this is so exciting. Look at
how many pictures of penises I'm getting.

96
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,867
Wow.

97
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,912
What a fantastic penis.

98
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,915
It's like a sunflower just bending

99
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,960
- towards the sun.
- Yeah, I know. It's, like, hopeful.

100
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:37,211
Mmm.

101
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:38,462
So, as we discussed,

102
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,840
you have bone metastasis
in your pelvic region.

103
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,341
-  I can't...
-  Treatment...

104
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,343
- I can't do this again.
- ...to slow the spread of the cancer

105
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,637
- and relieve any symptoms.
- What if I get up, walk out, die in a hole

106
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:49,348
- without any doctors or medicine or...
- But the main goal is to fight this

107
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,141
- for as long as we can.
- I could die like a bear.

108
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:53,394
I'm going to deploy
all the weapons in my arsenal.

109
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:55,312
- How do bears die? In caves?
- Okay. So, uh...

110
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,689
There caves in New York?

111
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:00,860
My mission is to extend your life
as long as possible.

112
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:01,986
Now, the--

113
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:03,071
Steve takes notes.

114
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,699
Oh, yeah. For sure. Got it.

115
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:08,034
No. Not the bag.

116
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,579
The bag is so bad.
The bag makes me so afraid.

117
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,788
-  I...
-  Um...

118
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,124
Oh, my gosh.

119
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,337
Are we getting close?

120
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,299
Close to computer.

121
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,176
Okay, I have the... 'Kay.

122
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:28,304
Are there two separate
crumb cakes in there?

123
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:30,765
- That's what they appear to be.
- It's a long story.

124
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:34,602
Uh, now, uh, first, we're going to do
some follow-up diagnostics

125
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:38,398
to, uh, assess the biochemical
and hormonal activity.

126
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:42,526
You'll need to schedule a, uh,
full-body scan ASAP.

127
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,320
- I'm so sorry. Sorry.
-  What?

128
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:45,905
I'm gonna interrupt
and ask a lot of questions,

129
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,240
'cause that's how my ADHD presents itself.

130
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,409
Not that I...
I don't know if I actually have ADHD,

131
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,910
but I'm pretty sure I do.

132
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,788
Um, would you mind just going a bit slower
and then I can probably take,

133
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,583
- like, "Steve notes," and...
-  Yeah.

134
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:01,545
The biopsy showed hormone-positive cancer,

135
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:07,344
so we're going to, uh, begin monthly shots
of leuprolide to lower estrogen production

136
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,678
and, uh, get you into menopause.

137
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,513
- Menopause?
- Menopause.

138
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:12,640
-  Right.
- What?

139
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,308
Sorry. That's funny.

140
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:17,269
'Cause I just thought that the one benefit
of dying young

141
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,606
was that I wouldn't have
to go through menopause.

142
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:23,525
So, uh, you can... you can expect symptoms.

143
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,779
Um, hot flashes, mood swings, insomnia,

144
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,240
uh, muscle pains, uh, decreased libido.

145
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,617
Oh, wait, no. Sorry.

146
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:34,411
That's not gonna work with Molly's goals.

147
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:36,163
It's okay, it's okay.

148
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,082
- Don't think about this.
-  What else do you have?

149
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,958
- Think about dicks.
-  What do I have?

150
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,877
There's so many dicks pouring
into your inbox right now.

151
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,421
- That is the first line of treatment.
- Yes. Dicks.

152
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,632
-  Let me see if I can explain.
- Dicks.

153
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:49,176
- Imagine you're playing a round of golf.
- Big dicks, little dicks...

154
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:52,513
- Lines of treatments are like golf clubs.
- ...round dicks, smooth dicks, funny dicks.

155
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:54,973
So, hormone therapy,
that would be like my driver.

156
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:58,519
- It's not a lofted club, but it's-- What?
- Oh, no, no. So sorry. Thank you so much.

157
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,479
We don't understand golf metaphors at all.

158
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,564
- It's just not gonna happen.
- Dicks.

159
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,400
- Oh.
- Can you explain what you are saying?

160
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,943
- Ooh, that's a cool one.
- Yes, uh, I can.

161
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:07,027
- Yeah.
-  Thank you.

162
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,822
So, like, a nine iron.
Now, that... that is a lofted club--

163
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,281
Oh, my God. No, not the golf.

164
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:13,659
- I don't want you to explain golf.
- Just ask. Ask the question.

165
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,744
When am I going to die?

166
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,998
The research is changing every day,

167
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,377
and every case is different.

168
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:29,300
But the five-year
survival rate is around 30%.

169
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,434
So not immediately, but soon.

170
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:41,980
I can't cure you, but I can give you time.

171
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:48,193
So get that scan
and let's get you into menopause, huh?

172
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,155
Okay. Right.

173
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,786
So, for the scan today,

174
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,289
- I don't have time for this.
- we need to send Molly's records over.

175
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,542
But you can't do that because a hospital
in the great city of New York

176
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,336
cannot communicate
with its patients unless it's through--

177
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,047
An app called MyChart.

178
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:12,134
The main things you need are ID,
insurance card, any CDs--

179
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:16,013
Any CDs like, actual 1998?
We're talking CDs?

180
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,057
Yes. Um, I'm gonna go get them from Steve.

181
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,308
Okay. I'm coming with you.

182
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:21,935
- No. You have rehearsal.
- Oh, my God. I have rehearsal.

183
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:25,064
-  I'll just be a little bit late.
- No, um, I got it. I got it. I got it.

184
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,776
I'm in. Calling. It's... I'm fine.

185
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,569
- Okay.
- I got it. I'm good.

186
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:32,071
-  Really. Go.
- Okay. All right. Okay.

187
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,697
So, I'll just see you at the scan.

188
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,491
- Yeah.
- Amazing. We're doing it.

189
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,493
- Oh. Have some cake.
- Oh, my God.

190
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:38,786
- It's loose and unwrapped.
- Whoo!

191
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:41,372
- I love you.
- I love you. I love you. Okay.

192
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,876
Okay. I'm just gonna call Steve.

193
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:49,672
Molly, your friend, uh, left her laptop.

194
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,134
- Thank you. Uh...
- Mm-hmm.

195
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:59,349
So, is Steve just gone?

196
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,059
Oh... Oh, yeah. Yeah.

197
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,144
Okay.

198
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,576
I don't have time.

199
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:26,584
Do you want to meet in person
and do it with me?

200
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,339
No.

201
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:37,095
Come and get this ass, boy.

202
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,475
So,

203
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:46,146
on this card, I think I have some points.

204
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:50,190
Um. Yeah, I'm not...
I'm not exactly sure how long I'm staying.

205
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:53,652
Uh, yes. I'd like your
finest suite to do some hard-core sex

206
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,156
with a guy named Jason R.
who just messaged me back.

207
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:11,713
Nope.

208
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,056
Oh, no. Is he real?

209
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:26,476
Is my cancer making me hallucinate
male models in elevators?

210
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,069
God, you smell.

211
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:39,365
Have you been working out?

212
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:44,203
Look at those AirPods
so tight in your ears.

213
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:47,498
Oh, I wish I was
an AirPod in your ear.

214
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:53,545
Talk to him. Talk to him. You're gonna be
dead in less than five years.

215
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,380
It doesn't matter.
Nothing matters. Talk to him.

216
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,465
Hey.

217
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,551
-  Yeah. That's good.
- Sorry?

218
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:02,847
Do you wanna come up to my room?

219
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,557
Why?

220
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,105
Oh.

221
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,484
Yeah. Cool.

222
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,036
Cool. Yeah. What the fuck?

223
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:27,412
He's gonna see your mastectomy scars.

224
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,039
Gonna have to hear about his childhood.

225
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,750
Are you gonna get his email address?
Are you guys gonna stay in touch?

226
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,003
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I changed my mind.

227
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,090
Have a great rest of your day.

228
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,122
I like your overalls.

229
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,659
Where's Peaseblossom?

230
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,244
-  Ready.
-  Oh.

231
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:52,372
No. No. You...
You enter like a waterfall.

232
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,207
-  I don't know.
-  What does that mean?

233
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,625
-  You can't do anything--
- Waterfall.

234
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,419
-  I know that.
-  Oh, you know?

235
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,630
I'm just... I'm at work, Steve.
She was supposed to call you.

236
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:04,259
Well, she didn't. And you don't know
where she is. So, you lost her.

237
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,471
I didn't lose her. I'm meeting up
with her after my rehearsal.

238
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:08,597
We're gonna go get a scan.

239
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:11,558
I know. Uh, uh, I get push notifications
from... from MyChart.

240
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:14,144
Did... Did you set up
your push notifications?

241
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:16,813
No, Steve.
I haven't had a chance to do that

242
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:19,274
in the half a day
that I've been dealing with this.

243
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,985
Okay. Look, the folder and the drive,

244
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,362
they have a username
and password for the portal,

245
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:27,115
- Oh.
- uh, social security, uh, infor-- Hold on.

246
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,159
Uh, this is super important.

247
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,119
This CD has all
of her medical records, okay?

248
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,371
- Okay.
- It's got PDFs from four years

249
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,706
- of breast cancer treatment, okay?
- Okay.

250
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,626
Can I get the MyChart info?

251
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:40,045
- You gave me the portal info.
- MyChart is the portal!

252
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,713
- Jesus!
- Okay.

253
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:42,964
No, not okay.

254
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,883
It's not okay because you have no idea

255
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,593
what it means to take care
of somebody with cancer,

256
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,096
and you're the least organized person
I've ever met.

257
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,889
- Okay.
- Here's the deal.

258
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,350
You can be the fun friend,
but if you're gonna be a caretaker,

259
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:55,477
you're gonna have
to be there all the time, okay?

260
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,229
You're gonna have to manage everything,

261
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,607
and you're gonna have
to watch her in pain.

262
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:02,235
Uh...

263
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,320
He... He wants to see you stroke my snout.

264
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,697
- Okay.
-  Wow.

265
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:11,327
Cool. Go do that.
No. Go stroke his fucking snout.

266
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,164
Do you really think you're the person
to take care of her?

267
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:19,043
Nikki. Donkey time.

268
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:24,507
Okay. I know that you're
in pain right now, Steve.

269
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,969
I am too. I am.

270
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,767
-  Okay.
- So, here...

271
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,811
Thank you. Sorry.

272
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,146
Okay. So I come up to him and,

273
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:42,023
"sleep thou,
and I will wind thee in my arms."

274
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:45,569
Um, why do I have a charge for $1,000
on my card for a hotel in midtown?

275
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,028
This is my place of work.

276
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,782
And 200 for some kind of sexual toy store.

277
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:52,869
What the fuck is going on?

278
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,416
Well, this is the biggest vibrator
I've ever used.

279
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:07,008
No.

280
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,050
What?

281
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,385
No.

282
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,596
Okay.

283
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:13,973
Oh.

284
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:16,684
Ma'am, you did very well.

285
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:20,688
Actually, you were incredible.
I've never seen driving like that.

286
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,857
- Annie.
- What?

287
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:26,359
- It's my name. Annie.
-  Call her Annie.

288
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,028
- Annie.
-  Yeah, call her fucking Annie.

289
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:29,321
As opposed to ma'am.

290
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,199
Okay.

291
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,121
One more time.

292
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:39,998
You can do it!

293
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,345
Talk about your tits. They huge?

294
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:54,513
No. They're nice.

295
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,807
I wouldn't call them huge,
but they're great.

296
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,607
And what did your mom say
when you brought up the nursing home?

297
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,109
She changed the subject.

298
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:09,945
- She always changes the subject.
- Mmm.

299
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:11,238
I like talking to you.

300
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:12,989
Aw, I like talking to you.

301
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,242
Can I see your pussy?

302
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:17,078
No, I don't think so.

303
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:23,083
Okay. Uh, thanks for watching.

304
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:25,543
Uh, don't forget to subscribe
to my YouTube channel.

305
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,004
Okay, I will. Thank you.

306
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:34,886
What the fuck?

307
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,639
She's on her way.
Just please hold the appointment.

308
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,141
Oh, come on, Carla.
I can tell you're starting to like me

309
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,144
by the way
that you're avoiding eye contact.

310
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:47,691
To schedule the next available,
I need an insurance card and records.

311
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:50,403
Okay. Let's do that.

312
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,781
What?  No.

313
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:57,952
Uh, I had the CD with the...

314
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,746
with the thing. With the records.

315
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,624
It's here...

316
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:06,752
Fuck it.

317
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,300
- Molly.
- Nikki.

318
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:14,509
I've been trying to call you.

319
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,220
Nikki, I clicked
a bad link on your laptop.

320
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,847
Oh, my God.
I don't have my laptop!

321
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,057
No, I... I know, I have it.

322
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:22,726
It's been hacked
by some kind of a porn man.

323
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:25,730
I don't know who he is, but someone
has a video of me masturbating.

324
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:29,107
- Pick that up.
- Sorry.

325
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,068
Um, is it a video that's, like,
clearly you?

326
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,653
Or will people think that that's me?

327
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:36,990
How is that your first question?
Nikki, help me! Help me!

328
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:39,618
I'm sorry! I'm... 'Kay.
Yes, I'm coming. I'm hanging up.

329
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:40,827
Clean that up.

330
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:43,497
I'm not gonna leave
all of my things on the floor.

331
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,125
Deeply humiliating.

332
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,253
To just observe me as I...

333
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:54,508
exist in my own personal hell.

334
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,058
Molly.

335
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:06,227
- Where are you?
- Don't walk in front of the computer.

336
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,980
I don't know if the camera is on.

337
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,441
- Oh, my God.
- The screen just froze, and then...

338
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:14,277
and then that window popped up
and said they have a video of me.

339
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,780
What's going on here, buddy?

340
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:20,200
- Well, I got a vibrator delivered.
- Let me see it.

341
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:23,495
Well, it's... it's resting right now
in the ice bucket. It overheated.

342
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:24,747
What?

343
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:28,083
What the fuck did you do to that thing?

344
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:29,292
I didn't call Steve.

345
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,836
I panicked, and I... I came to this hotel,
and then I got a room,

346
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:35,006
and then I tried to meet a guy,
but... but I got scared, so-so...

347
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,966
so I just...  ...I masturbated all day.

348
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:40,137
No, that's good. That's good. That's good.
Masturbation is important.

349
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:41,722
What if I just...

350
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:45,141
Steve thinks I'm just, like,
running away into some kind of a fantasy.

351
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:48,854
No. No, you're doing everything
you need to do.

352
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:53,566
Uh, speaking of, I saw Steve.

353
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,986
Um, I got your records from him,

354
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,531
and now they're not in my bag.

355
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:02,367
- You lost my records?
- Well, they were in my bag. I'm just--

356
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,536
Your bag is a black hole.
I've always hated your bag.

357
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,830
You need to clean your bag.
You need to organize your bag.

358
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,290
Okay.

359
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,292
I'm sorry.

360
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,378
I'm sorry.

361
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,714
I don't know how to do this.

362
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,841
I'm not, like,
a pro at taking care of people.

363
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:20,885
- I'm bad at taking care of people.
- Not your fault. It's too much to ask.

364
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,053
- Yes, it is.
- I'm calling Steve.

365
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:25,223
Don't do that. Don't call Steve.
No, don't do that. I can do this.

366
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,268
Don't go and hide and be safe with Steve.

367
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:31,438
He does not care about what you want
or who you are.

368
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:32,689
And that's why you married him.

369
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,192
And it was chickenshit then,
and it's chickenshit now.

370
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:42,158
Shit. The screen.

371
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,326
It's growing.

372
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:53,918
Oh. Look at you. Look at you.
You are so beautiful.

373
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:01,050
-  Oh, my God.
-  No. What?

374
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:03,428
- Oh, my God! Can I use your credit card?
- Oh, no, no. Me?

375
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:06,306
Please. Steve will get a bank alert
on our joint account.

376
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:08,558
I don't... I don't have that.

377
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,518
We want to help you.

378
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:13,022
I mean...
...it's not like a chat, right?

379
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,523
Oh, my God.

380
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:17,568
Sir, we want to be cooperative.

381
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:22,031
We're just trying to figure out where
the funds might come from at this point.

382
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:30,497
Coming back
was the right decision.

383
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:31,874
No, I'm not back. I--

384
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:34,919
I... I fixed everything.

385
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,171
I paid the ransom to the man.

386
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:41,090
I don't know how much it was
'cause it was in Bahamian dollars,

387
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,635
but that's okay.

388
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,221
I want you to have everything you want.

389
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:50,893
And if what you want is to
masturbate with men online...

390
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:52,770
...I'm okay with that.

391
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:56,689
Why?

392
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,359
Because I think this is all some part
of your healing process

393
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,612
around your... your... your core wound.

394
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:04,864
I'm sorry, can we please close this?

395
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,534
I can't keep looking at this photo of you.

396
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:10,703
Why not? Why can't you look at it?

397
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,997
It's disgusting.
I don't wanna see you like that.

398
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,500
I... Like I said,

399
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:17,752
I'm open to you exploring your urges.

400
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,589
I just...
As long as this doesn't happen again.

401
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:24,051
- I shouldn't have called you.
-  What?

402
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:26,428
I'm not gonna call you again.

403
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:30,015
Come on. Just...
Is it 'cause I said "disgusting"?

404
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:35,354
We don't need to get divorced.

405
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:38,148
I don't want anything from you.

406
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,317
I don't want any money.

407
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:46,197
I'm gonna liquidate my 401.
I had that before we met.

408
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,283
And...

409
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:51,661
And now we know I'm not gonna get old, so...

410
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:52,746
Jesus.

411
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:56,083
Go. Go.

412
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,961
Oh, God.

413
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:01,421
Hey. Don't...

414
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:02,505
Don't do this.

415
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:05,550
The only thing that I ask is
if I can stay on your insurance, okay?

416
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:07,219
Yeah. Yeah, of course. Of course.

417
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,680
Molly, I'm tryna protect you.

418
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:14,810
I'm sorry I said that. I just...
I'm trying to keep you safe. Okay?

419
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:19,815
That was stupid.
I shouldn't have said it.

420
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:23,944
Do you think we even know each other?

421
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,198
Yeah, I do.

422
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:32,244
I think we do.

423
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,179
Look what I found.

424
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:56,268
- It was stuck inside my leaf face.
- Of course it was in your leaf face.

425
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:57,977
I'm sorry.

426
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:01,606
Can we just get drunk? Because it's
my last night before menopause.

427
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,275
What's all that?

428
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:07,070
This? I moved out.
This is my lamp now. I did it.

429
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:10,866
Oh, my God.
Oh, this is all your stuff!

430
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,910
Okay.

431
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:15,995
All day I've been thinking
about this one thing,

432
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,747
which is that my Aunt Pearl told me

433
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:21,000
that she had the best sex
of her life during menopause.

434
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:23,544
It's like they make you think
that's not gonna happen,

435
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:27,215
but in fact, she, like, really focused up
about it and she kind of, like, dedicated...

436
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:29,509
It was, like, in her schedule.
I remember this.

437
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,888
It cut into her hours at the community
center. She didn't give a shit.

438
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:35,808
What are you... What are you... What is this?

439
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:37,935
Can I look where you're looking?

440
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,229
Is that for me,
or is he trying to get a drink?

441
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,439
I think that's for you.

442
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,653
Do you think he can tell
I've come six times already today?

443
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:49,946
Oh.

444
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:52,992
Who's gonna make it number seven?

445
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:55,702
Nice lamp.

446
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:58,705
Hell yes.
I'm gonna empty my voicemail box,

447
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:00,665
which actually is something
that I have to...

448
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:04,003
...I've been meaning to do it.
I love you. My phone will be on.

449
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:17,224
I probably shouldn't have brought
this lamp with me.

450
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:25,107
I want him.
I want him to rub that beard on my face.

451
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:31,488
I want him.

452
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,661
Oh, God. I want him right now.
I can't wait anymore.

453
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:40,621
I can't wait. I...

454
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:42,124
Do you wanna kiss me?

455
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,753
Yeah, very much.

456
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,657
Did I... You okay?

457
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,618
No, it's great. Keep going.

458
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:19,703
- Okay.
- Okay.

459
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,084
- I love your boobs.
-  Thanks.

460
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,473
-  Jesus. Fuck.
- Okay. Hold on. Hold on.

461
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:43,351
- Shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
- Oh. What?

462
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:45,020
Shit. Shit, shit, shit.

463
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,438
- I'm gonna come.
- Oh.

464
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,733
Not in my car. Not in my car!

465
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,652
-  What the fuck?
- I barely touched you.

466
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:53,737
Oh.

467
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,281
Come on, dude.

468
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:03,163
Hey, I got you.

469
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:07,375
I'm sorry. Oh.

470
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:08,752
I'm coming!

471
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:15,591
Oh! Sorry.

472
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:19,011
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That felt so good.
- It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

473
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:22,223
- Get the fuck out of my car.
- I don't think he can.

474
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:24,559
- I'm sorry.
- Get out of my car! Get out of my car!

475
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,562
Get out of my car!

476
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:28,604
Your side. Your side.

477
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:33,442
-  Are you okay?
- Ah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

478
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,736
I'm sorry. Thank you. I'm sorry.

479
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:37,321
- Oh, shit. My hat. My hat.
- Your hat. Your hat.

480
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:38,614
Her hat.

481
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:42,451
- Don't forget the hat. Yeah, yeah.
-  Are you okay?

482
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:44,704
Hold on. It's too tender. Don't.

483
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:46,706
It's too much right now.

484
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:49,792
- I'm sorry.
-  No, don't be sorry. It's fine.

485
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:52,545
- Sorry. I'm sorry.
-  No, no, no...

486
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:56,383
Upside mine

487
00:27:57,718 --> 00:28:00,178
Upside mine

488
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:05,349
When you touch my body
With your fingertips

489
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:09,186
Touch my body
Till I don't exist

490
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:13,065
Touch my body
Till it really fits

491
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:16,819
Touch my body
Please, please, do it

492
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,448
Upside mine

493
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:23,327
Upside mine

494
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,080
Upside mine

495
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:30,918
Upside mine

496
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:36,005
When you move your body
Up next to mine

497
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:39,842
Move your body up
And give a sign

498
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:43,721
Move your body up
And turn it around

499
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:47,642
Move your body up
And slide it down

500
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:50,103
Upside mine
