1
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:08,133
Just hold still, Molly.

2
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:10,844
Sorry if I'm being dramatic.

3
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:13,721
Mmm. Yeah, I'm not feeling anything.

4
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:15,598
Really? 'Cause I thought I felt something.

5
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,686
You know, the chances are so
small that it would be cancer at your age.

6
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:21,687
Don't worry.

7
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,982
Get some sleep.
Are you drinking enough water?

8
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:28,360
The gloves down here are always too small.

9
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:32,740
Maybe your hands
are too big. You know what that means.

10
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:34,325
Oh, my God. Are they flirting?

11
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,452
You're blushing.

12
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:39,288
It's like I'm not here.
It's like I'm part of this table.

13
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,333
I'm so sick of being a patient.

14
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:44,251
Hold on.

15
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:46,796
Okay, Molly. I'm gonna put on some music.

16
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,014
Leaning out the window

17
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:58,767
Touching stars

18
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,519
I don't want music.

19
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:04,772
I don't want music!

20
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,148
Got to live your life

21
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,192
Stop. Stop the music!

22
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,944
Please, please don't move.

23
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,403
Stop!

24
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,656
Hi. Okay... Um...

25
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:20,788
Sorry, listen. Uh, w-what exactly, uh,
is the issue wi-with the radiation?

26
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:24,625
I just... I wa... Is it okay if I just
take a break just for a few days?

27
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:25,709
- I'm... I'm sorry.
- We really...

28
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,710
No, no. Don't say sorry.

29
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:29,546
-  I need a break. I need a break.
-  Sorry. Listen.

30
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:32,132
- Don't say you're sorry, Molly. Get angry.
- Wait. Laura,

31
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,384
- I need you to help me out here.
- What? I'm sorry.

32
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:35,886
Dr. P, it's Nikki.

33
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:37,429
- My name is Nikki.
- Nikki.

34
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,014
Nikki. Of course, I'm sorry.

35
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:40,766
Thank you, Sonya, for piping up.

36
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,684
And, look... No, I know.

37
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:44,895
I-I understand. I-I get it.

38
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:49,358
What with the hip surgery, you have
both had, huh, a rough time this month.

39
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,527
What did you say? A rough time?

40
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:52,444
- Well...
- Okay.

41
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:55,447
I just want you to remember
that pieces of her bone have been removed.

42
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,574
She's got a metal rod in her leg.

43
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,660
And now she has a tumor in her eye.

44
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:02,371
So I'm pretty sure
you didn't just say, "A rough time,"

45
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,873
because if you did,
then you're gonna have to go ahead

46
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:07,043
and kiss Laura's ass.

47
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,046
-  Oh, fuck.
-  What...

48
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,633
- I'm sorry.
- Um...

49
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,677
Well, I can't unsee that, can I?

50
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:17,762
No, obviously you can.

51
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:30,941
He's been an oncologist for 40 years.

52
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:33,360
They're talking about
banning you from procedures.

53
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,404
-  That makes sense.
-  Is she okay?

54
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,823
She looks so tired.

55
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:38,615
I think we're both losing it.

56
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:39,783
...losing control like that.

57
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:44,246
"Blindfold sex. Cuckolding.
Tickle torture. Lactation fetish?"

58
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,414
I don't think I have that one.

59
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,874
- Okay. That sounds right.
- No, no, no.

60
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,877
"Wall Street wolf by day,
your little bitch by night."

61
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,087
- Huh, that's promising.
-  No, no. It's fine.

62
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:55,382
I won't grab my butt
at any more doctors. Okay?

63
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:57,135
You have been so angry.

64
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:00,095
I... I'm great. I'm fine.

65
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:02,765
And I'm doing all this, and I'm smiling.

66
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:06,101
Well, it's a very weird smile.

67
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,103
- Is it?
- Mm-hmm.

68
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,021
Molly.

69
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:11,566
Molly.

70
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,610
Radiation is gonna make you
feel better in the long run.

71
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:17,237
- I don't think that you should stop.
- I don't wanna talk about being sick.

72
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:19,282
I joined a kinky dating app yesterday.

73
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:22,492
Do you think
I'm a spanko painslut cuckquean?

74
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:24,662
Yes. Oh, yes.

75
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:27,874
I hear you.

76
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,752
You both need a break from the hospital.

77
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,214
- Okay. Come here. Come here.
-  What's this?

78
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,424
Shh. What're you doing tomorrow night?

79
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:41,678
And do you have any clothes
that you would describe as pop princess

80
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,723
who is secretly fucking
all the Spice Girls?

81
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:48,561
I, like, have been preparing
for whatever this is for my entire life.

82
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,481
Do I look like I have cancer?

83
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,983
- No, you look like you have chlamydia.
- Okay.

84
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,777
Really? That's what I was going for.

85
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,779
-  Hi, hi, hi.
- Hey.

86
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,696
You look perfect.

87
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:00,864
- Thank you.
- Is that food?

88
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:03,534
Ah, it's lasagna. It's for the potluck.

89
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:10,165
This is a sex party potluck?
This is a fuck potluck?

90
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,376
That's my ex. It's their party.

91
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:15,212
Whoa, there's some really
interesting smells in here.

92
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,507
Like vagina and oregano.

93
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,133
Is that a butthole? No, it's a lamp.

94
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,677
- Sonya.
- G.

95
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,429
And Sonya's friends.
Let me take your coats.

96
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,347
- Welcome, welcome.
- Hey.

97
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,975
Okay, well,
obviously you guys signed the waiver,

98
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,309
so you understand the rules, right?

99
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,936
There's no touching without consent,

100
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:34,606
- and if anyone makes you uncomfortable...
-  Oh, my God. This is too much.

101
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,692
I'm staying for ten minutes,
and then I'm leaving.

102
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,068
Here are your drink tickets.

103
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,570
- I want that. Yeah.
- Yeah. And, uh...

104
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,572
- Sorry, but we're out of ice.
- It's 10:15.

105
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,408
- How are you already out of ice?
- You wanna get ice?

106
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,410
- Get ice. A lot of people came.
- You are so chaotic.

107
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,869
- They had ice.
- Okay, okay, okay.

108
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,956
- I drink my shit neat.
- All right.

109
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,457
So...

110
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,251
In this room, no phones.

111
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:58,088
Oh, my God.

112
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,550
We have dancing!

113
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,510
We have some cuddling happening.

114
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:07,014
Vulva studying. Shibari ropes.

115
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,267
Hey, Sasha. Are you getting tied tonight?

116
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,313
You do, I know you do, baby

117
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,731
Bet, bet on that

118
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,108
You do, bet you do, s-say you do

119
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,568
Bet, bet on that

120
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,196
You, you, you do

121
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,266
Do you like that?

122
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,894
- You're mine now.
- Yes.

123
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:54,978
Oh, yes.

124
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,148
You're incredible.

125
00:05:58,274 --> 00:05:59,525
Touch yourself.

126
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:04,197
Yeah. Just like that.

127
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,993
Don't come until I say so.

128
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,287
Please.

129
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,205
Please.

130
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,623
Now.

131
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:19,920
Perfect.

132
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,513
What's going on for you right now?

133
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,348
You okay?

134
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,147
That's-That's what I want.

135
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,488
What did Sonya tell you about us?

136
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,240
Uh, nothing. Just that you dated and--

137
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,034
Uh, we didn't date. We fucked.

138
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:52,119
Dykes can be disgusting people.

139
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,997
It was profane. Almost sacrilegious.

140
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:59,501
God. I just...
I just loved watching you at the party.

141
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,503
Tell me how to do what you do.

142
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,004
Why are you whispering?

143
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:05,007
You think this is something
to be ashamed about?

144
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,008
No.

145
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:11,264
Look, topping's a sacred skill, okay?

146
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,933
All right? It's just learning
what terrifies you,

147
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,769
and working with that until you come.

148
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:20,772
It's about facing down the shadow self
that lives inside all of us, right?

149
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,191
Who are you inside?

150
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,277
What type of animal are you?

151
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,529
Yeah, I don't know.

152
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,907
I mean, I'm not a top. Or... Or...

153
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,326
I-I don't know what you call it.
Like, a... Like a dominatrix.

154
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:36,329
It's-It's not about the terminology,

155
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,998
it's about the subconscious, right?

156
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:38,958
Don't even think.

157
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:42,002
What do you fantasize about?
Tying someone up?

158
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,796
Total control? Anything.

159
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,799
I kicked my neighbor in the fucking dick.

160
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,968
Fuck, yeah. Fuck, yeah. Yes, you did.

161
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,720
See, that's hot. That's some shit.

162
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:54,389
See, now-now we're talking, right?

163
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:57,767
So you get off on having
a certain type of power, right?

164
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:58,978
- Yes.
- Hmm.

165
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:02,857
So the first step then is to put yourself
in a more submissive role.

166
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,902
No, I wanna be in control.

167
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,445
Right, right.

168
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:11,781
Well, in order to be good
at being in control,

169
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:16,870
you need to understand
what it's like to submit sexually.

170
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,331
- So, look. I'd be willing to show you.
- No.

171
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,832
You don't wanna submit to me?

172
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,083
No. I-I need to be in charge.

173
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:24,044
Submission scares you, I get it.

174
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,462
I was just looking for some pointers.

175
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:31,344
When you're ready to meet
your shadow self, come back.

176
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,305
The whale's in my section again.

177
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,932
Thank you for-for your time.

178
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,558
-  What?
- Thank you.

179
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,394
Your sister wants to know
why you quit the play.

180
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:43,104
- Oh, those jeans are so cute.
- Thank you.

181
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:45,690
Why do you smell so bad?

182
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:46,858
Oh, my God.

183
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,235
- Ugh.
- She went to a sex party last night.

184
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:53,406
No. It was a...
It was a kink-forward play party potluck.

185
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,200
I need you to stay as far away
from me as possible.

186
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,869
I'm too pregnant for that shit.

187
00:08:57,995 --> 00:09:00,622
Okay, and I didn't quit the play.

188
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,124
I would not ever quit the play.
I got fired.

189
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,795
Why? Because you're taking
Molly to doctor's appointments?

190
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,254
Don't do that.

191
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,965
She's at the hospital every day.
She's being amazing.

192
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:13,843
So what, you're just
gonna let Molly ruin your entire life?

193
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,470
I'm sorry, but I'm concerned.

194
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:18,390
This is new for you.
The taking care of someone.

195
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,477
Can you just shut up?
Like, just stop fucking talking.

196
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:24,855
Hey, Nikki. You okay?

197
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:26,857
I'm sorry.

198
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:34,532
Sorry.

199
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,493
So my buddy started calling me
Hoops as a goof,

200
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:39,786
because I sucked at basketball.

201
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,329
And then they started calling me Hooper.

202
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,582
How do we start talking about it?
I don't know.

203
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,751
- I think I'm the one that has to initiate.
-  Actually, I changed it legally.

204
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,171
So when did you figure out
that you liked orgasm torture?

205
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:53,675
Uh, probably when I was canvassing
for Obama. Like '06.

206
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:54,844
Oh.

207
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:57,554
So do you wanna go over boundaries?

208
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:58,973
Oh, right. Yes. Um...

209
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,474
No bruises. I work in finance.

210
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:03,685
But I do want you to step on me.

211
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:06,354
And I'm into penis humiliation.

212
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:07,981
- Is that when I yell at your penis?
- Mm-hmm.

213
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:11,818
Yeah, I want you to talk
about how small and sad my penis is.

214
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:14,279
And are-are you into cock cages?

215
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,282
Excuse me. Sorry. Is it possible
to get some whole milk with this, please?

216
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,701
-  Sure.
-  Like, the good stuff from a cow.

217
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,787
Let's go to the World Wide Web.

218
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,249
Oh.

219
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,500
Oh. Yeah, I can do that.

220
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:28,586
Yay.

221
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,463
What about you? What're your limits?

222
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:32,882
Oh. Um...

223
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:34,550
I keep my underwear on.

224
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,802
I don't talk about my personal life.

225
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,430
No penetrative sex.

226
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,766
And you don't come unless I say so.

227
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,477
Totally cool. I can respect a hard limit.

228
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,521
I like your, uh, cane.

229
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:50,148
Oh, shit. The cane.

230
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,485
Is that part of the kink?

231
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,362
Oh, yeah.

232
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:56,363
It's my thing.

233
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,210
Can he tell the belt
is actually a back brace?

234
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:14,047
Stop it. You have all the power.
You're in control.

235
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,341
He shouldn't be standing in front of you.
He should be kneeling.

236
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,426
Kneel down.

237
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,180
Where everyone could see you,
you dirty little boy.

238
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,324
-  Can I smell you please?
-  Yes.

239
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:50,458
No, your neighbor saw you?
Did you talk to him?

240
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,752
No, I couldn't, 'cause
I was in the middle of getting smelled.

241
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:53,878
- Oh, but of course.
- Besides,

242
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,839
he doesn't even look at me anymore.

243
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:01,511
So... So I had cock cage guy
walk on his knees into my apartment.

244
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:05,932
And then I tried to insult his penis,
but when I took off his clothes...

245
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,267
Oh, my God. I'm so scared.

246
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,103
What was it? Was it awful?

247
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:12,773
It was beautiful.

248
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:17,194
Like, this was the most beautiful dick
I have ever seen.

249
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,238
You hate it, don't you?

250
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:24,033
It was like finding a beautiful
secret waterfall made of penis.

251
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:24,951
Yeah.

252
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,661
It was like a penis waterfall.

253
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:28,748
Is it the worst one you've ever seen?

254
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,000
What a terrible dick.

255
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:38,047
What a stupid, stupid penis.

256
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,507
Now stand up.

257
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:48,475
It goes through the... Yeah, that goes...

258
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:51,270
Just thread that through the...
The little metal part.

259
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,397
It's-It's like a bike lock.

260
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:57,902
You're doing great.

261
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:00,862
I'll just... Here. I'll get it.

262
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,156
- Okay.
- Yeah. It's... This is tough.

263
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,699
This part is actually the hardest part.

264
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,577
It's just, like... Kinda tying a shoe.

265
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:10,079
- Just over the loop, and... boop.
- Okay, got it.

266
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,289
And once it's on, just clip that.

267
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,248
Okay. Sorry.

268
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:14,709
- I practiced. I just...
- It's okay. That's okay. That's okay.

269
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,211
So then what're you supposed to do?

270
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,254
You put it in the thing. In the...
Did you cage it?

271
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:20,340
No. I mean, I couldn't do it.
It was too big.

272
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,925
- Shut up.
-  Yes.

273
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,426
I had to, like, cram it in

274
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,136
like I was balling up a sweat sock.

275
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,846
You did it. You just go for it.

276
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:29,474
He's coming back tomorrow
so that I can step on him.

277
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,142
Oh, my God.

278
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,814
Yeah. Hold on.

279
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:38,359
But, well, let me just figure it out,
'cause I gotta check my schedule.

280
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,318
That's him.

281
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,611
Well, let me just see. Hold on a second.

282
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:42,947
That's my old doctor.

283
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:48,201
Oh, have you been coming here a lot?

284
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,118
Yes.

285
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,579
I... No. I-I don't know.

286
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,748
I just like to watch him.

287
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,667
Well, either's good.

288
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,461
Come on.

289
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:02,341
How... How do you not just,
like, wanna fucking kill this guy?

290
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:04,801
Look at this fucking asshole.

291
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,010
That's--

292
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,930
This is fucking bullshit right here.

293
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:12,809
He couldn't be bothered to
order a mammogram, and now you're dying,

294
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:16,271
and he's like, "Oh, I'll just do, like,
normal fucking shit right now."

295
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,565
Just normal fucking life
for this fucking asshole.

296
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,067
Stop, stop. I don't want him to see me.

297
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,908
When did we both get so angry?

298
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,744
Are you okay?

299
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,789
Yeah, I am fine.

300
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:40,628
Well, actually, whatever. I didn't
really know how to tell you this,

301
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:44,299
but I got fired from the play a month ago.

302
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,383
No.

303
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,928
Actually, I quit.
Or it was a quit-fire situation.

304
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,471
It's not a big deal.

305
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:52,849
I missed a bunch of rehearsals,
which is whatever,

306
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:57,478
but I didn't wanna tell you because
I did not want you to think

307
00:14:57,479 --> 00:15:00,189
that it was, like, because of you,

308
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,774
or it happened because
I'm taking care of you.

309
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:03,986
- It is. It is because of me.
- No, it's not.

310
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,783
Wait, but then why have we been
running your lines together?

311
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:14,413
That's a good question.
I actually don't know.

312
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,166
I guess I just like
reading Shakespeare to you.

313
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:25,340
Okay. That's hilarious.

314
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:28,385
Okay, that's great.
Well, yeah. Well, you better.

315
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,192
Hmm.

316
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,435
I'm gonna cover your face.

317
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:58,517
You're weak. You're pathetic.

318
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:03,646
- I hate you. I hate you.
-  Red.

319
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:06,149
I hate you.

320
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,483
Red. Red.

321
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:08,651
- I hate you!
- Red!

322
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:09,903
What?

323
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,491
What?

324
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:17,660
Sorry, why did you say...
Why did you call the safe word?

325
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:18,911
You were great. You were great.

326
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,246
It's just, uh...

327
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:23,709
It-It kinda felt like you were thinking
about something else there.

328
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,046
And you gotta be careful.

329
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,881
Like, top drop is really scary.

330
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,676
Let's get some...
Let's get some snacks, and...

331
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,386
Uh...

332
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:36,680
Zesty jalapeño chips?

333
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,064
Shit.

334
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,573
I would like to...

335
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:59,244
I am here to submit sexually to you.

336
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:01,537
-  Jesus.
-  What?

337
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,372
You said not to whisper or to be ashamed.

338
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:05,542
Okay,
but can you keep it chill a little bit?

339
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:07,543
Come on.

340
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:10,130
I'm going on break.
Nobody touch my napkins.

341
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,299
You're right. I'm scared.

342
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,384
I'm scared...

343
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,594
I'm scared of not being in control.

344
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:20,307
I'm scared of not being able
to feel or move.

345
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:23,810
I'm scared of losing my body.

346
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,604
Something happened to you, right?

347
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:29,483
Yeah.

348
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:31,860
I get it.

349
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,573
Look, vanilla sex...

350
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,659
you can disappear, right?

351
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,121
You can fake it. Who cares?

352
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:47,251
This shit, you can't disappear.
Especially if you're in control.

353
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:50,795
Right? That's like driving a car
and taking your hands off the wheel.

354
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,464
It's fucking dangerous, right?

355
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:59,138
You need to just learn to stay present.

356
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,223
Stay right here.

357
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,351
Can you show me?

358
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,979
Do you want to submit to me?

359
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:11,483
Yes.

360
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:14,528
Good.

361
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,368
Remember, you have the power
to stop this at any time.

362
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,164
I wanna touch you now.

363
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,166
Is that okay?

364
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:29,668
Yes.

365
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:41,012
Anyone could walk in here
at any second and just see us and...

366
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,472
Shh.

367
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:44,473
Quiet.

368
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:48,562
Just be here.

369
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,616
Just breathe.

370
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:05,870
Do you like that? Do you want more?

371
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:06,955
Yes.

372
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:11,126
What do you want me to do next?

373
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,632
Don't go anywhere. Stay right here.

374
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,342
Stay right here.

375
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:27,476
I want...

376
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:38,987
you to tie my hands together,
but I don't want them over my head.

377
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,741
Good. Good.

378
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:22,239
Was that too much?

379
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:23,782
No.

380
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:43,510
Okay, I wanna stop now.

381
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,138
Okay.

382
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,098
Good.

383
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,024
That was beautiful.

384
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,948
You're so powerful.

385
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:13,664
Okay, so, uh, you've decided
to do the radiation. Good. Um--

386
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,167
I want you to sit next to me.

387
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,711
Oh, I'm sorry, I have a very busy--

388
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:20,130
Sit.

389
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,154
I'm going to hold your hand now, okay?

390
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,532
Okay.

391
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:57,292
I'd like to know your first name.

392
00:22:58,335 --> 00:22:59,336
Oh.

393
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,296
It's Jerry.

394
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:05,216
- Jerry, hi.
- Hi.

395
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,634
Where are you from, Jerry?

396
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:10,846
Ooh. Well, um, just outside Toledo.

397
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:12,640
Um, near the zoo.

398
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,934
Jerry, going forward,

399
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:18,062
I need you to walk me through ahead
of time, step by step,

400
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,065
what will happen during a procedure.

401
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:23,484
I need you to answer
all my questions, and Nikki's.

402
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:26,737
I need you to listen to me
when I say what I feel,

403
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:29,408
and hear me when I say I need a break.

404
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:34,454
Now breathe with me.

405
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,416
Breathe with you? That's...

406
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:41,293
That's not...
That's not my cup of tea.

407
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:43,213
- I don't... I don't think I can--
- You can do it, Jerry.

408
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:10,991
Okay. You can go now.

409
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:31,011
We're gonna figure out
a way to not be so angry.

410
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:46,318
I forgive you!

411
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:47,861
Look at me!

412
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:51,156
Yeah! Fuck you!

413
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,868
I forgive you. I forgive you!

414
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:59,455
Yeah! Me! I forgive you!

415
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,166
I forgive you!

416
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:09,424
I forgive you.

417
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:16,515
I would like something special

418
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:21,852
I would like to hold it,
Touch it, it be real

419
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:27,776
Something cool and bendable

420
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:29,944
Hey. Um...

421
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:33,532
Molly told me how you helped her,
and I wanted to say thank you.

422
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,079
Why don't you come inside,
take off all your clothes,

423
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,706
and put on the movie Minions?

424
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,793
Yes, my king.

425
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:53,677
Can it watch out
And tell me when I'm crazy

426
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:56,428
This fucking guy.

427
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:59,641
...could be vulnerable

428
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:03,394
I would like that too

429
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,604
I don't know if you're embarrassed
about what happened

430
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:08,023
or if you think about it at all,

431
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:11,361
but we're gonna keep bumping into
each other, so get over it and look at me.

432
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:17,157
Something cool and bendable

433
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:18,660
I think about it all the time.

434
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:22,913
I would like something special

435
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,124
I said look at me.

436
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:30,255
I want something cool and bendable

437
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:37,512
I would like something unusual

438
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:45,645
I would like it to know how to party

439
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:50,525
Something unflappable

440
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:54,903
Can it have moves and platform shoes

441
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:58,240
And know how to dance

442
00:26:58,241 --> 00:27:01,620
I would like something special

443
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:08,710
I want something cool and bendable

444
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:15,091
I would like something special

445
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:21,806
I want something cool and bendable
