1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,302
I played this song
in the car this morning.

2
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:14,680
- Surprise!
- Hi. What...

3
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,849
What is this?
What... What's happening? What--

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,936
My metastatic cancer
is one year old today!

5
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:21,270
Oh.

6
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:23,773
Dr. P, do you want some cake?

7
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:26,067
No, thank you. Oh, Funfetti.

8
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:27,860
- But no. I... You... Actually, I will...
- Hmm?

9
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,738
I will take one of those party hats.

10
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:32,281
Nothing would make me happier.

11
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:35,869
Aw. The thing is, I actually...
I actually have a one year old.

12
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:39,372
You know, she quacks at ducks.

13
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:40,498
Cute.

14
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:42,708
So, anyway, I wanted to, um...

15
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:48,673
I just wanted to check in and, tell you
that the scan showed no new spreads. So...

16
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:51,050
Holding... Holding steady.

17
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,052
No, but I wanna keep an eye on the nausea,

18
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,053
- right?
- Okay.

19
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,514
Cannabis therapy seems to be working.

20
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:57,265
And Sonya tells me that

21
00:00:57,266 --> 00:01:02,436
you are the most popular member
of the stage four, uh, support group.

22
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:04,730
- So... Yes, so...
- Stage four. Stage four.

23
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,232
- Yep. Stage four.
- Well, good. No, good. Good.

24
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:09,110
And so, what's everyone doing
for Thanksgiving?

25
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:10,653
- My partners are cooking.
- Par...

26
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:12,154
I didn't know you had a company.

27
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,365
No, no, partners. I'm in a polycule.

28
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:16,409
I'm in a relationship
with two other people.

29
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,578
Well, that's fantastic. Good.

30
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:23,624
Yeah. More... More hands
to stuff the turkey.

31
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:26,294
- Or...
- Naughty. That's nasty.

32
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:27,461
Yeah, okay.

33
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:30,423
Well, this has been a...
Just the most wonderful party for your--

34
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:31,424
Love you, Dr. P.

35
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,009
- Thank you.
- Oh, well, that's very sweet.

36
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,760
- Well, here. I'm gonna give you this back.
- No, no.

37
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,012
Keep it. Keep it, please.

38
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:37,306
Thank you. Thank you.

39
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:39,181
Right?

40
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:46,023
<i>♪ Nothin' shakin' on Shakedown Street ♪</i>

41
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,152

42
00:01:58,327 --> 00:01:59,452
Oh, my God.

43
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:01,746
Is that what I think it...
Is that a butt plug?

44
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,623
And its little friend.

45
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:05,583
Hold on--

46
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:06,959
- Ta-da.
- Aw.

47
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,128
It's a whole butt plug family.

48
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,087
- Yeah.
- Baby, mama, papa.

49
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:12,465
I did not know that you guys
were into butt plug stuff.

50
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,425
Yeah, he said he wanted to give it a try.

51
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:15,926
Special Thanksgiving treat.

52
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,470
Oh, my gosh.

53
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,263
Before the meal, I hope.

54
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,351
If you know what I mean.

55
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,936
Hey, if you guys are gonna do stuff
with your butts and butt plugs,

56
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,688
can you just not do it on the couch?

57
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,149
Because that's my home now.

58
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,984
I go where his butt leads. So...

59
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,112
- Hey, man...
- No guarantees.

60
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,989
Happy cancer birthday, baby.

61
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,533
Thanks. You're the greatest woman alive.

62
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,160
I'm sorry I can't eat this beautiful cake.

63
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,787
I can't eat anything good.

64
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:47,833
All righty. Okay, I'm outta here.
That's him.

65
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:48,959
Okay. You okay?

66
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,795
Yeah, I'm good. I love the hallway.

67
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:53,839
I love the buzz of the fluorescent lights.
It really chills me out.

68
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,424
Thank you. You have everything you need?

69
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,052
Oh, yeah.

70
00:02:58,762 --> 00:02:59,762
Hey.

71
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:02,890
She's... Oh. She's in there.

72
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,519
Okay. Uh, what... what are you up to?

73
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:08,771
What am I up to?

74
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:11,065
Yeah. I mean, you know,
we never get the chance to talk.

75
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,191
So I just thought maybe...

76
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,567
We could talk about what I'm up to.

77
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,570
Okay, I'm gonna call hospital billing

78
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,824
and yell at them for sending bills
that are not real bills

79
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:21,952
when they actually just want
her insurance company to pay.

80
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:25,496
And then I think that
I will try to look for an apartment.

81
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:28,999
Um, but one that would let me sign a lease
without income or money.

82
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,168
And then if my system can take it,

83
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:35,548
I will get more stoned
so that I can forget my broken heart.

84
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,467
Oh, so, you got a pretty full night.

85
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,720
Yeah. Totally.

86
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,681
Okay.

87
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:45,809
You make her happy.

88
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:51,231
Okay, ticktock. She's only got energy for,
like, one more hour. So... You go.

89
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:04,326
Tell me about this plant you got me
for my cancer birthday, ya piece of shit.

90
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,872
I just panicked and I got you a plant.

91
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,623
Do you like it?

92
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,042
I hate it.

93
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:15,921
I'm gonna put it
in a pot with no drainage.

94
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,300
It's a monstera deliciosa.

95
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:21,844
Unique foliage, easy to care for.

96
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:24,638
You know what happens
if you keep talking about the plant?

97
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,141
You're gonna need to let it dry out
a little bit between watering.

98
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,147
Did that hurt?

99
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:35,400
Yeah. Yeah.

100
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,443
- Yeah.
- Do you want some cake?

101
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:38,612
Yes, please.

102
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,459
Eat it off my finger.

103
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:03,094
- Is that Funfetti?
-  Shut the fuck up.

104
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:10,477
I'm gonna untie you.

105
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:25,659
Keep licking.

106
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,637
<i>Oh, of course you're here.
Of course you show up.</i>

107
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:48,515
<i>No. Not now.</i>

108
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,184
<i>Not now.</i>

109
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:53,854
<i>Get out.</i>

110
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:55,772
<i>Get out.</i>

111
00:05:58,275 --> 00:05:59,275
Are you okay?

112
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:05,782
I'm sorry.

113
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:14,665
I got messed with when I was a little kid,

114
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:15,750
and I...

115
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,880
I've never had an orgasm
with another person.

116
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,384
I'd like to try to come with you.

117
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,429
I'd really like to try that,

118
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,140
if that's something
that you would like to try.

119
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:32,350
Yeah.

120
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,227
Yes.

121
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,981
I'm... I don't know how many times I can
say yes without sounding like a creep.

122
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,194
Now go stand against the wall
and show me that little pink butt.

123
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,239
In the corner!

124
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:50,909
I have some good news.

125
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,037
Mm-hmm.

126
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,581
I told him I wanna come with him.

127
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,126
Thank you, thank you.
So we're gonna try that.

128
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,712
And Sonya's helping me
with deep breathing techniques.

129
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:02,963
So I'm feeling really good.

130
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,884
And I think I'm gonna try
and come by Christmas.

131
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:07,509
Like a Hallmark movie.

132
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,763

Thank you for letting me join this group.

139
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,657
You know what I want for Christmas?

140
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:34,411
A new fucking wig that doesn't
make me look like Bea Arthur.

141
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:39,708
I know. How about insurance start
covering wigs with Black hair texture?

142
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,210
That would make me come.

143
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,839
I think we all need a deep breath in
for that one. Come on now.

144
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,302
And chill.

145
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:53,305
Listen, you seem pretty cool,
but what are you doing here?

146
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56,517
Don't you have anything better to do than
hang around with a bunch of dying bitches?

147
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:57,976
- Uh...
- Uh...

148
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,646
- Slight burn, but... No, I don't.
- Yeah.

149
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,231
I actually don't.

150
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:06,402
And I think I'm good for the group
because I'm generally very sad.

151
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:07,736
Very, very sad.

152
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,572
Um, because my boyfriend and I broke up.
And also--

153
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,740
Fuck him.

154
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,325
Uh, Nikki is an amazing actor.

155
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,245
Not anymore, but... Yeah. I don't know.

156
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,456
At least I don't have cancer,
'cause that seems like it sucks.

157
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,042
All right. We're gonna try
something new today.

158
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,794
I want you to get out your notebooks.

159
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:25,796
We're gonna write something
that scares us.

160
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:26,880
-  Yes.
- Or draw it.

161
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:30,176
And I'd like you to keep working
on these at home this week, okay?

162
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:31,928
Let's go.

163
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,232
What are you writing?

164
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,291
What are you doing?

165
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,297
You're being weird. You need me.

166
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,811
Steve took us to this therapist

167
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:26,065
who said that if I told the story
of what happened to me again and again,

168
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,233
then I would get over it.

169
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,906
But I never really wanna
talk about it in front of Steve.

170
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:37,452
So tell me the story.

171
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:39,704
But you already know it.

172
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,750
Yeah, but I've never
really heard it all together.

173
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,588
- I wrote it down.
- Mm-hmm.

174
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,673
I can read it to you.

175
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,189
"The summer I turned seven,

176
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,609
I was molested by my mom's new boyfriend.

177
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,154
He was rich.

178
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,366
He had a fancy watch that my mom loved.

179
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,494
He was taking us to Florida.

180
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:22,831
So the night before the trip,
we stayed at his apartment.

181
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,210
We took our suitcases over in the rain.

182
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,846
My mom asked for orange juice.

183
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:42,182
I was standing in the doorframe between
the living room where my mom was,

184
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:45,937
and the bedroom, where he was stirring
powder into her juice with his finger.

185
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,189
I didn't tell her.

186
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,693
A few minutes later, she passed out cold.

187
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:56,656
Then her boyfriend had me play oral sex
games, telling me he loved me. And...

188
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,786
All I wanted to do was leave.

189
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:04,371
But he'd hid my clothes.

190
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:07,666
So I threw a brush at him
and stormed out of his bedroom.

191
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,960
I wanted to go home.

192
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,673
I went to find my mom.
I shook her as hard as I could.

193
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,508
"We have to go," I said.

194
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:20,180
She woke up for three seconds
and said, "Go on, I'm sleeping."

195
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:25,643
Then I went back to the boyfriend and
apologized for hitting him with a brush."

196
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,605
Are you sleeping? Was that so boring?

197
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:32,191
What? No. I'm crying.

198
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,108
Oh.

199
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,235
Obviously I'm crying.

200
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:37,655
Yeah, that makes more sense.

201
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,575
It's okay.

202
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,376
- Did you fart?
- Yeah.

203
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,630
You farted.

204
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,632
I'm sorry.

205
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:57,966
It was a stress fart.

206
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,137
I figured you couldn't get mad at me
'cause of what I just told you.

207
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,766
No, obviously I'm just gonna
have to deal with it. Yeah.

208
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:07,976
It's just... I'm just really right here.

209
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:16,778
Do you think I'm cured?

210
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:21,907
Do you think 'cause
I said it out loud that I'm cured?

211
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:34,336
I think that we should call Sonya

212
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:37,215
and find a therapist.

213
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:39,842
No, I can do it.

214
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,096
I have you.

215
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:58,903
Tell me where.

216
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,615
On your leg.

217
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,160
Just with one finger.

218
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:09,998
On the inside of your thigh.

219
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,793
Say please.

220
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:15,753
Please.

221
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,214
Yes.

222
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,885
You can touch my thigh with one finger.

223
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:42,822
Knee.

224
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,914
My leg.

225
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,421
Foot.

226
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,884
Toes.

227
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,223
Palm.

228
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,813
Fingertips.

229
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:18,733
Chest.

230
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,160
Scar.

231
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:36,000
<i>"I'm afraid the people I love
want me to die.</i>

232
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:40,797
Because it's hard for my family to know..."

233
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,133
I feel so stupid.

234
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,720
I mean, she's reading
what I wrote, but I'm dancing?

235
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,013
She's gonna read what you wrote out loud,

236
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,057
and you're just gonna move along with it.

237
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,060
Try to find
where the fear lives in your body.

238
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,187
You got this. Okay.

239
00:14:56,771 --> 00:15:00,148
"It's hard for my family
to know I'm dying,

240
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,234
but not right away.

241
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,612
Sometimes I feel them pulling away.

242
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:07,532
I don't blame them.

243
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,575
Fine, I blame them.

244
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:15,248
But my wife isn't pulling away.

245
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,916
And I feel guilty.

246
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,877
Like I should start letting her go.

247
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,549
Speaking of letting go,

248
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,801
I just shit my pants. Bye."

249
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:29,971
Yes.

250
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:32,974
Okay, who's next?

251
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:37,395
Are you pregnant again
or is this the same baby?

252
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,313
- Is... No, I know that sounds wrong.
- What?

253
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:43,358
Of course it's not the same baby.

254
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,986
- You've met my daughter. No. This is...
- I... Yeah, I know.

255
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:47,696
This is... I'm pregnant again.

256
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:49,948
If you're gonna keep
having so many babies,

257
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:53,160
I feel like you should at least
change your fuckin' maternity wear,

258
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:54,786
because it does all look the same.

259
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:56,913
It seems like a prank.

260
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,375
Okay. You are a mess.

261
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,628
You don't even have a bed.
Look at us, please.

262
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,754
We... Look at us right now.

263
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:07,842
We're right next to the elevator,
and we're having Hanukkah in a hallway.

264
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,177
All right. Okay. Seriously.

265
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:12,345
- You need... I have...
- No, get serious.

266
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,973
- Honestly, this is the setting for it.
- I have to get serious with you.

267
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,141
Right? I'm in my business attire.

268
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:19,478
- Let's fuckin' talk.
- You need boundaries with her.

269
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:21,730
Okay? You... I'm serious.

270
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,649
Thanks. I will. I will try to do that.
I'll... I'll work in...

271
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,986
I'll work on boundaries with my...
my dying best friend.

272
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,947
- Look, I know you love her. I know that.
- Look, I got it.

273
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,450
But it...

274
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,702
I just thought you were gonna take her
to some doctor's appointments.

275
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,245
- I had no idea you were gonna give up...
- What?

276
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,330
...everything else in your life.

277
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:39,706
Like, you loved Noah.

278
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:43,293
Yeah, it was never about taking her
to fucking doctor's appointments.

279
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:45,129
- Well...
- It was... I was always, like...

280
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,048
How do I explain this to you? Like, this.

281
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:51,176
This is some of her blood on my shirt.
I don't even know when it's from.

282
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,762
I have her blood on, like,
half of my shirts at this point.

283
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:55,848
It's, like, how I look, okay?

284
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,850
And... And when I see this,

285
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:03,563
what I think is,
I'm gonna be happy that it's here.

286
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:07,235
I'm gonna be happy that this stain is here
when I don't have her anymore.

287
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,414
Does she know what you're doing for her?

288
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:30,508
Hey, you know what?
We forgot the most important part.

289
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,554
Oh, yeah, we did.

290
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:38,266
- Okay.
- You ready?

291
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:45,772
<i>♪ Oh Hanukkah, Oh Hanukkah
Come light the menorah! ♪</i>

292
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:48,818
<i>♪ Let's have a party
We'll all dance the hora ♪</i>

293
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,611
Can I touch you again?

294
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:55,700
Here.

295
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,984
Okay.

296
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:41,746
I love you.

297
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:49,128
Is... Is that weird timing?

298
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:09,190
<i>No.</i>

299
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:12,610
Molly?

300
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,445
Molly?

301
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:17,405
<i>Go. Go.</i>

302
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,247
<i>Go.</i>

303
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:46,143
"The first man who told me
he loved me was my mother's boyfriend.

304
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,817
He made me say it back to him.

305
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:56,111
He wanted me to say the words.

306
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:59,740
I think he knew
he was taking away love for me.

307
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,702
He is there every time love is there."

308
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,167
I'm sorry. This isn't gonna work for me.

309
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,419
- I...
- It's okay. It's okay.

310
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,254
Just return to the breath.

311
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:16,589
No. No, I-I don't need to dance
about something

312
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:19,092
that happened 30 years ago.
It's not gonna change anything.

313
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:20,677
Molly. Uh, your leg.

314
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:23,221
No. I'm not gonna breathe into my leg
and send it kind energy.

315
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,224
No. Your leg is... Your...
Your leg's all puffed up.

316
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,813
Oh, great. Fucking great.

317
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:37,026
You have deep vein thrombosis in your leg,

318
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:41,781
and we don't want those blood clots
to move to your lungs, huh?

319
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:46,370
So you're gonna have to go on
some pretty heavy-duty blood thinners

320
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:50,916
and, um,
I'm afraid you're gonna have to spend

321
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:56,839
at least a few weeks here
so we can, uh, monitor you.

322
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:01,385
Um...

323
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,388
Do you...

324
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,683
Do you want me to breathe with you?

325
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:12,187
She hasn't spoken in a couple hours.

326
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:14,731
-  Right.
- I think she just needs some time.

327
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:16,274
Of course, of course.

328
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:21,322
No, nobody wants to spend
Christmas in the hospital, right?

329
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:25,493
I'm sorry. So...

330
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,706
Hey. Hey.

331
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,420
You'll come by Martin Luther King Day.

332
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,255
Presidents' Day.

333
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,800
It's what Lincoln would have wanted.

334
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:43,093
Definitely JFK.

335
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:48,807
It's him.

336
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:51,060
Are you sure that
you don't want to take that?

337
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:11,705
Here you go.

338
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,961
One for you.

339
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:19,129
Enjoy.

340
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:22,925
Merry Christmas.

341
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:31,307
After tonight, you're gonna be like,

342
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:35,103
"Why have I never spent
New Year's Eve at the hospital?

343
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:37,146
What have I been doing my whole life?"

344
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,149
- We're ready.
-  Babe? Babe?

345
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,442
Yeah?

346
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:42,361
I'm leaving.

347
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:45,822
What?

348
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:48,741
I'm checking myself out of the hospital.
I just made a date.

349
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:52,620
You just can't, like... With who?

350
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,664
You remember that guy
I canceled on three times?

351
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:57,334
Dante. He has the karate dojo in Queens.

352
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:02,255
Well... uh, are you gonna wear that?

353
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:03,632
Yeah. Why?

354
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:06,801
It's kind of a bummer. Like, I just...

355
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:11,514
I got these dresses because they're for us
to wear on New Year's together.

356
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,391
- Okay.
- That's what this is.

357
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,977
How much were they? I'll pay you back.

358
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,061
Obviously, it's not about that.

359
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,732
They were five dollars at
a thrift store. It's more just, like...

360
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:23,693
What is this? Like, who is this guy?

361
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:25,778
- Is he even kinky? Do you like him?
- I don't know.

362
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:28,114
- Like...
- I don't know. I don't care.

363
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:31,868
He said he likes hand jobs.
And, lucky for him, so do I.

364
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:33,662
- Cool.
-  Come here, gorge.

365
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:39,208
Okay. Cool. So you're gonna
check out of this hospital,

366
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:43,339
awesome idea, and leave
to go give a stranger a hand job?

367
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,131
Yeah.

368
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:51,387
Rather than, let's say, trying to
be with someone that you're in love with?

369
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:52,305
Stop it.

370
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:54,475
I'm sorry, but it's just like,
what are you doing?

371
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:58,311
You were really, really close.
You were so close.

372
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:00,146
I was never close.
It wasn't serious, okay?

373
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,941
I'm gonna be late. Jesus.

374
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:04,943
What do you want me to do here?
You just want me to sit here

375
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:06,986
and watch you try to hurt yourself now?

376
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,071
That... This, right here,

377
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:12,617
this whole fucking move
is why I gave up my whole life? For this?

378
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,369
I told you not to give up your life.

379
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:17,246
- That's what I told you not to do.
- You told me you wanted to die with me.

380
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:19,082
So I am dying with you.
We're dying here together.

381
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:21,167
- No, it's not happening to you.
- That's what we're doing.

382
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:22,418
You're not dying.

383
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:23,504

401
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:17,933
Hey.

402
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:21,020
Happy new year.

403
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,773
Oh, thanks.

404
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:33,657
Why'd you stop?

405
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,661
Sorry, I can't feel my hand.

406
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:39,872
Just keep going. Come on.

407
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:46,085
What are you doing?

408
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,755
Breathing exercises.

409
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:49,673
I thought we were hooking up.

410
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,593
Did you hear me?
I said I can't feel my hand.

411
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:56,889
Why would I give you a hand job
if I can't feel my hand?

412
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,940
Like, how much longer
are you gonna breathe for?

413
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,109
I'm still hard.

414
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:11,945
I don't want to do this anymore.

415
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,031
This feels bad.

416
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,033
Are you fucking serious?

417
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,245
Yeah. So fucking serious.

418
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:22,998
Good luck with your dojo.

419
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:43,977
You were right. It sucked.

420
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:55,530
I'm sorry.

421
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:57,699
No, I am sorry.

422
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:04,789
You do not have to be happy,

423
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,959
and you don't have to be happy for me.

424
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:11,171
It's just been so hard.

425
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,635
I keep thinking about everything.

426
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,847
I can't get any of it out of my head.

427
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:28,313
Yeah. Then I think
maybe just let it be there.

428
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:44,079
I'm so sad.

429
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,251
Yeah, I think you're grieving.

430
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:54,672
I think you're finally...
you're really grieving what he did to you.

431
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:55,883
No. I wasn't.

432
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:06,435
I tried to hold his hand,
and he told me to stop being a child.

433
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:13,025
And you did.

434
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:18,864
You did. You did stop being a child.

435
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:52,606
Oh, yes.

436
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,274
Yes.

437
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:08,621
Oh, my God. Why am I laughing?

438
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:10,539
Sonya said, you know, you just go for it.

439
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,916
You can laugh. You can burp.

440
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,417
You can fart. You can yawn.

441
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,921
Whatever you need to feel,
you just do that.

442
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:50,932
Hey.

443
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:55,770
- Hi. Just wanna say hi.
- Hi.

444
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:57,522
Didn't wanna interrupt your walk.

445
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:00,066
It's a beautiful day.

446
00:31:00,067 --> 00:31:02,068
Yeah. Yeah.

447
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:03,444
- Um...
-  Where's Nikki?

448
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:04,529
Oh, she's with her sister.

449
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,325
All right. Well, I'll-I'll see you.

450
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:11,620
I've never seen you
outside in the day before.

451
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,581
Is it disappointing?

452
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:24,299
Well, I'll see you.

453
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,978
Molly?

454
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:38,854
Hey, Molly.

455
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:39,772
I think I fell.

456
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:41,316
Yeah, I'm gonna call an ambulance.

457
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:43,025
Wait.

458
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:45,362
- No, I don't think I should wait.
- Shut up for a second.

459
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:49,157
I want you to know I love you.

460
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:53,245
And I think we should
just love each other.

461
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,706
I love you. Of course I love you.

462
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:59,583
I think we have a real future together.

463
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,965
I love you.

464
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:08,134
- I love you. I love you.
-  Hello? Hi. Hello.

465
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:11,637
Hello. I've got an emergency
and need an ambulance.

466
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:12,972
I love you.

467
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:15,182
She's struggling to breathe.

468
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:18,562
We are at the corner of St. James and...
