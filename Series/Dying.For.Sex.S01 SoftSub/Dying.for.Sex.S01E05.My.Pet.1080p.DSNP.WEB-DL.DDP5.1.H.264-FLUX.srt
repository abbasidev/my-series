1
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:09,843
Touch me. Please.

2
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:12,261
Please.

3
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:14,473
How dare you?

4
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:18,018
I'm so fucking hard.

5
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:31,073
You don't get off this elevator
until you have calmed down.

6
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:55,639
Please.

7
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,434
Please.

8
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:03,313
- You wanna see it?
- Yes.

9
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,440
Yes.

10
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:15,241
Closer?

11
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:16,326
Yes.

12
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:39,308
Kiss my thigh.

13
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,284
Touch yourself until you come.

14
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:30,984
Oh, shit. Fuck.
Get it together, Molly.

15
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,781
Is the chemo port
at least fucking covered?

16
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,374
I touched your thigh with my face.

17
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:46,874
Is that okay?

18
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,086
Yeah, that's okay.

19
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:54,715
I mean, these past few months
have been weird, you know?

20
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:57,010
I mean, it's been great.

21
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:02,265
Um, but I've never done anything
like this before and, you know, I love it...

22
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:07,062
but I feel bad
that I'm not making you come.

23
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:10,148
Are you getting anything out of it?

24
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:12,567
Yeah.

25
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:18,699
The way you look at me
when I give you exactly what you want.

26
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:23,203
You look at me like you want me so much.

27
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:28,250
Uh, can I just say that
your eyes are mesmerizing?

28
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:34,548
And I know that sucks to say out loud.
I'm sorry, but they are.

29
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,971
Um, are you really
not gonna eat these cookies?

30
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:44,516
Because, if you don't,
I will eat all of them.

31
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:55,360
And, look, I know, you know,
that you do this with other people.

32
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:56,862
Um...

33
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:00,323
A couple days ago,
I heard a guy barking like a dog.

34
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:04,286
Oh, yeah. I just started seeing him.
He likes to be a human dog.

35
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,329
Well, he's very good at it.

36
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:09,624
Very loud and realistic.

37
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,251
So...

38
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:17,214
All right. I'm gonna do something
that neither of us want, um,

39
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,050
which is talk about my feelings.

40
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:21,428
I, um...

41
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,598
I was with somebody for years. And...

42
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:28,934
I'm just gonna dive in.

43
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,353
Um, she cheated on me.

44
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:34,648
Um, and then we decided
to open up the relationship.

45
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,276
But that just gave us an excuse
to be horrible to each other.

46
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,154
Plus, this guy named Pierre
entered the picture,

47
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:43,241
and we had very bad threesomes with him.

48
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:47,662
And I wound up with, um, sores on my taint

49
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,040
from an STD
that doctors thought was extinct.

50
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,751
She gave you a... a prehistoric STD?

51
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:57,714
Yeah. I mean, she was a wonderful woman.
And I wish her well.

52
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:02,719
You know, I just... I've been very lonely.

53
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:09,518
I don't mean alone,
but I've been very lonely in my life,

54
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:16,149
and, um, doing this with you
has made me feel...

55
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,444
not lonely.

56
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:27,827
And, look, I know I don't know you at all,
and I have a lot of questions.

57
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:31,206
I mean, the first time that you kicked me,
I had to call an ambulance,

58
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,251
and then you were gone
for a very long time.

59
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,461
And when you came back,
you were walking with a cane.

60
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:41,132
I mean, did kicking me in
my rock-hard dick permanently cripple you?

61
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,094
I wanna believe that's true, but...

62
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:46,805
Are you okay?

63
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:49,683
Just tell him.

64
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:52,686
I don't wanna talk about it.

65
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:17,377
Sorry. Sorry, sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I have to take her to chemo.

66
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:25,176
I have to get the tooth removed.

67
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,304
What?

68
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,471
She's...

69
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:30,849
Just give me a second.

70
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,185
It's just...

71
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:36,062
It's like a magic trick.

72
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:37,939
Oh, my God. Okay.

73
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:42,526
I have to get a tooth removed.
So I can't take Molly to her next chemo.

74
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:45,112
Okay, we don't recommend
that you go alone.

75
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,156
Because of the exhaustion
and the chemo brain.

76
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:50,327
You know, you forget how to speak English.
Is there anyone else that can take you?

77
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:52,829
You gotta do it.

78
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,957
Do it for Nikki. Do it for Nikki's mouth.

79
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,042
Uh, my mom.

80
00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:59,878
Great. Is she able to come?

81
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,838
Yeah. I mean, I think so.

82
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,633
Oh, Jesus.

83
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,092
I-I just have to tell her
my cancer is back.

84
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,012
She didn't even tell her
that she has cancer again.

85
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:11,847
It's all good. I have some literature

86
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,724
- on how to tell loved ones.
- Great.

87
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:16,602
And it's okay to say directly
what you need from her.

88
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,313
Like, I like to hold some space
for silence.

89
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:21,523
- Hold some space for silence? Very cool.
-  Yeah.

90
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,275
You're gonna do that?
Think that's gonna work?

91
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,736
Wait, what's your relationship like?

92
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,155
It's had its ups and downs.

93
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:31,617
The biggest down was that her boyfriend

94
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,535
made me give him a blow job
when I was seven, so...

95
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:34,621
Big down.

96
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,000
Okay.

97
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,669
- Wait, this is funny.
-  Uh...

98
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,253
His name was Mark Wallace,

99
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,922
and when I went back
to school in the fall,

100
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,965
my second grade teacher's name
was Wallace Mark.

101
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,258
I shit you not.

102
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,224
Sorry. I just gotta laugh.

103
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,768
You were seven years old?

104
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,647
Yeah. I mean, I told my mom.

105
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:05,234
And she just fell apart,
and she did go to rehab a few times.

106
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,820
I had to keep convincing her
that it wasn't her fault.

107
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:12,032
I got tired of doing it after 30 years, so
now sometimes we don't talk for a while.

108
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:15,285
- I'm just gonna cancel my appointment.
- Wait. No, no. It's fine.

109
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,954
Okay, I'm in a good place,

110
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,831
and she lives in Vermont
with a goat farmer,

111
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,418
so, you know, like,
let's just rip that Band-Aid.

112
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,963
Now?

113
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:27,965
Wait, wait. You're doing it right now?

114
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:32,594
Mom?

115
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:33,679
Hang on,

116
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,432
I'm in the coop collecting eggs,
and I gotta move the owl.

117
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:39,143
I've got a-a real hawk problem. I...

118
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:42,021
Mom, my cancer is back.

119
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,148
What?

120
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:45,233
It's stage four.

121
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:46,943
It's, uh...

122
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:50,320
It's in my bones. It's incurable, so...

123
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,324
I'm dying.

124
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:59,496
I'll come there right now.
Where are you right now? I'm coming.

125
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,081
Okay, guys, just shut up!

126
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:04,752
Gonzo, Jill, Toto!
Senator Peanut, stop it.

127
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:06,462
I'm holding space for silence.

128
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,923
I'm trying to talk to my daughter.

129
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,808
I've got a good boy treat.

130
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:20,976
Stay!

131
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,854
Oh! Down!

132
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,147
Stay.

133
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:28,275
Stay.

134
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,278
Go get it!

135
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:36,325
I've never had someone
check me for ticks before.

136
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:37,868
How did you think of that?

137
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:39,662
Mmm. It just came to me in the moment.

138
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:41,998
You're incredible.

139
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:46,001
- I felt so taken care of.
- Aw.

140
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,587
Is there anything else
you wanna try next time?

141
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,672
No judgment.

142
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:58,139
Uh, actually, there is something
I've always wanted to do.

143
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:04,270
But I've never said it out loud before.

144
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:06,523
Um...

145
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:08,525
Hey.

146
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:13,487
I wasted so much time
worrying if I was normal

147
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:18,576
or if I was turned on by normal things.

148
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,663
There's nothing wrong with you.

149
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,501
Okay. I, um...

150
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:28,586
All right, here.

151
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:31,840
Uh...

152
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:34,050
I wanna be peed on.

153
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:37,929
Yeah, just let me think about it.

154
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,235
Hi, Gail.

155
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:57,281
- Mom, is that a dog in your car?
- I'm fostering him.

156
00:10:57,282 --> 00:11:00,284
Can he stay in your apartment
while we go to the hospital?

157
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:03,620
- No. Molly's immunocompromised.
- No, I mean... Yeah. It's okay. It's fine.

158
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,331
Can you get his bed, his bag and...
Oh, his leg.

159
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,125
- Is this the bag with everything?
- Yeah.

160
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:10,794
Um, her keys are in here
in case she can't open the lock.

161
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,504
Sometimes she loses feeling
in her fingers.

162
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,424
- Yeah, yeah. I'm her mother.
- Okay.

163
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,216
- Okay.
- Here, take the dog.

164
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,511
- Oh, um...
- Don't forget to walk him.

165
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:24,142
- She brought a dog.
- I'll have my phone on me the whole time.

166
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,145
I have four foster dogs now.

167
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:31,106
The dogs, yeah.
We're back to the dogs.

168
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,233
Toto. Senator Peanut.

169
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:35,235
She wouldn't let me get a pet
when I was a kid.

170
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,320
Gonzo.

171
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:38,280
We did cat-sit for her drug dealer.

172
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,490
- Sweet little Jill.
- I liked that cat.

173
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,201
Oh, they need so much help.

174
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:45,787
One of 'em doesn't have a rectum.
That can get complicated.

175
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,124
What are you watching?

176
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,792
It's called Drunk Girl Falls off of Llama.

177
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:54,839
How are you feeling?

178
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:56,882
Yeah, great.

179
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:57,967
Yeah.

180
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,261
No, I-I feel good
when I'm heading into chemo.

181
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,847
It's just the two days after chemo
that I feel like I wanna die,

182
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:07,560
but that's convenient,
'cause that's what's happening.

183
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,147
I don't care what they say.
You're gonna beat this.

184
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,194
Should you be eating that?

185
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:20,155
You once sent me to school
with just a hot dog bun for lunch.

186
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:24,619
I read a great article about
raw cloves of garlic and cancer.

187
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:26,829
Raw garlic cures stage four cancer?

188
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,875
Why did you wait ten months to tell me?

189
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:34,753
I haven't told anyone.

190
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,589
Mentally, are you okay?

191
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,595
I called Steve.

192
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:45,138
What?

193
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:48,600
I wanted to know what happened
and if you were okay.

194
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,143
I told you I was okay.

195
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,230
I don't know why you had
to hear that from Steve.

196
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:55,441
He said you were on
some kind of a sex quest.

197
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,069
A sex quest?

198
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,699
Ta-da.

199
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,993
You were so cute.
You're still cute.

200
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:07,286
Oh, man.

201
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:15,168
Oh, look at you and Dad.
You guys look so in love.

202
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,586
I was.

203
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:20,800
That's just the way his face looked
when he knew he had cocaine in his pocket.

204
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,679
Oh, I love this one.

205
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,391
Oh, my God.

206
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,143
Uh...

207
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:31,686
That was...

208
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,230
He... He took that. That was the...

209
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:36,399
After the recital.

210
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,360
No, he didn't. I don't remember that.

211
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,530
I would never have
put this in here if I'd thought...

212
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,614
Okay, well...

213
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:47,577
Okay, fine, let's just take it out.

214
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,290
Is that why you're doing
what you're doing?

215
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:56,836
Having sex with strangers,
because of what happened?

216
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:01,214
Oh, this is my fault.

217
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,302
- I'm just trying to figure out who I am.
- This is all my fault.

218
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,471
Are you ever gonna forgive me?

219
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:09,014
Am I interrupting?

220
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,307
Hi.

221
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:12,309
-  Sheila. You came.
- Hi. Hi.

222
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,560
- Sorry, what is...
-  Oh.

223
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:14,895
-  Hi.
- Um...

224
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:17,689
What are you... Why? What?

225
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:21,194
I started a meal train
with your cousins who live in the city.

226
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:25,614
You mean you told...

227
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:27,157
You told... You told them?

228
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:30,661
Of course. I told the whole family
so you didn't have to worry about it.

229
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,330
- Do you like chilaquiles?
- No, no, no.

230
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:37,209
I'm sorry. I can't have that.
The... The pepper hurts my mouth.

231
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:40,338
- Oh. Okay.
- I don't want this. Like, whatever this...

232
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:45,050
Chemo brain. What is this called,
this thing you organized?

233
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,220
Toot-toot. Meal train's here.

234
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,180
I brought bagels. Hi, Gail.

235
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:51,264
Hi, Steve.

236
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,433
Hi. Hey, Molly.

237
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,560
Hi, Steve.

238
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,816
All right. Try and get some rest.

239
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,860
Here, let me take off your shoes,
okay, baby?

240
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,238
Mmm.

241
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,407
You're so nice.

242
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:12,745
What's wrong with you?
Why are you still with me?

243
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:16,124
Oh, you're so hot!

244
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:22,087
- He is a sexy person.
- Baby, baby, let's go to bed, okay?

245
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,881
- Yeah. Whee!
- One, two, three. There you go.

246
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,342
- Nice. Okay. Lie back.
- Yeah. The wind in my sails.

247
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,803
- You have to sit up, he said, okay?
- Mmm.

248
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:30,887
Little bit.

249
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:35,934
- Oh, this is so nice.
- There it is. The queen.

250
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,644
- Where are... Yeah.
- Hey.

251
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:41,232
Is that my phone? Is it Molly?

252
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:45,194
Can you make sure if it's Molly?

253
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:49,073
I can do it. Give it to me.

254
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:53,827
Uh, no, it's not Molly.
Let's just get some sleep, okay?

255
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:56,747
Thank you. Thank you.

256
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:01,126
You have a beautiful spirit.

257
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,377
-  Get in there.
-  All right.

258
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,504
It's all good. Thank you.

259
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,090
It's just I didn't eat lunch.

260
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,970
Wow. This is a trip being back here, huh?

261
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:13,430
We spent a lot of time
in this room together.

262
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,433
-  We sure did.
- The first time around.

263
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:21,314
She was so strong. So brave.
She fought so hard.

264
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:25,150
Uh, you're gonna eat your scallion
cream cheese. I got a whole tub of it.

265
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:28,195
- Just for you.
-  Oh, my goodness. Thank you.

266
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:31,281
- You were so good to her. To all of us.
-  Aw.

267
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:32,949
- Oh. Thanks.
- You really were.

268
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,994
Yeah. Dig around in there.
There's some other little treats in there.

269
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,372
- When did you guys actually break up?
- Technically, we're still married.

270
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,875
Because, of course,
I wanted to keep her on my insurance.

271
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:44,586
I mean, I don't wanna abandon her.

272
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:46,880
But, you know, this has been
good for me too.

273
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:49,090
- I started seeing somebody.
- Did you? Wow.

274
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,052
Yeah. It's casual.

275
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,013
But, um, she's actually here.

276
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,183
I wasn't sure if it would be weird
to bring her in.

277
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,476
-  Bring her in.
- I wanna meet her.

278
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:01,144
- Really?
-  Yeah.

279
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:04,315
Molly, do you wanna meet
the woman that I'm seeing?

280
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:07,776
What? Molly?

281
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:08,944
'Cause I really...

282
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:12,114
Stop. I really want her to meet you.
It's important to me.

283
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,658
You're an inspiration.

284
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:18,411
Steve said you're beautiful,
but you're, like, radiant.

285
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,205
Maybe it's the radiation.

286
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,873
I don't know what's going on here,

287
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,417
but you're only allowed
two to three visitors.

288
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,504
So, who's this?

289
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,676
Hi, Pet.

290
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:33,927
Um...

291
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:35,846
I'm also seeing someone.

292
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:38,766
Okay.

293
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,980
Oh, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

294
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,482
-  Mmm.
-  Oh, God. Oh.

295
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,528
Oh, oh. Oh.

296
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,948
There's my good boy.

297
00:17:56,075 --> 00:18:00,495
Okay. I actually need to get back to Rudy.
I'm pretty sure he's done playing tennis.

298
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,623
Ooh. He probably is.
Mom, don't you wanna go say hi to Rudy?

299
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,668
I guess.

300
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:09,921
Just call me whenever you're done
doing whatever this is you're doing.

301
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,549
Okay. Yeah.
It's really good seeing you, Molly.

302
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,050
I think we're also gonna head...

303
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,512
- Hey. Get away from her. Hey!
- Don't touch me.

304
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:21,600
Down, down. Come here.
Don't let those mean people scare you.

305
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,769
It's okay.

306
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,816
Yeah, it's okay.

307
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:36,907
I think I'm ready.

308
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,369
You all set?

309
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,622
Yes, please.

310
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:50,588
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, my God.

311
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:53,840
Oh! Oh, God.

312
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,467
- Oh, yes.
- Oh.

313
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,052
-  Fuck.
-  Whoo!

314
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:03,351
- Oh, my God! Mom!
-  What?

315
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:09,440
Mom, I said that I would call.

316
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:11,734
Is that what you...

317
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,486
People like that?

318
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:15,904
Yes, people like that.

319
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:17,156
You like that?

320
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:21,451
I don't know what I like, Mom.
I'm-I'm trying things.

321
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:23,245
Well, you better clean your bathtub.

322
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:27,249
Oh. I just came to get my dog.

323
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:31,044
Thank you for tonight. It was so special.

324
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:32,128
Oh.

325
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,923
- And I didn't know that you had cancer...
- I'm sorry.

326
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:36,257
It's okay. It's fine.

327
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,385
Thank you, Pet.

328
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:39,344
Really?

329
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,097
Do you have any idea what's in her pee?

330
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:46,393
She just had a chemo infusion.
So you've got chemo all over you now.

331
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:47,852
Is that bad for me?

332
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,564
- I don't know.
- I hope you didn't get it in your mouth.

333
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,735
- Oh, God.
- I'll google it.

334
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:56,821
Oh, my God.

335
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,239
- Oh, my God.
- I'll google it.

336
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,615
Okay. Oh, God.

337
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,617
- I'll google it.
- Did you... Did you swallow?

338
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,577
- It's closing... My throat is closing up.
-  Okay.

339
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,996
My throat is closing up.

340
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:10,125
- My throat is closing up.
- Well, take that stupid collar off.

341
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:13,211
- Can you get the key? Unlock it.
- Shit. I don't know... The key.

342
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,796
- Where's the key?
- Over there.

343
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:17,382
Yeah, I--

344
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:20,218
- Uh... Key. Key.  Okay. I got it.
-  It's itchy.

345
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,595
- Can you do it?
- I don't have thumbs in my suit.

346
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:25,390
Okay. I can't feel my fingertips
after chemo.

347
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:26,766
- Oh, God.
- Mom?

348
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,977
- Can you help?
- I'm not touching him!

349
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,229
- I can't breathe. I can't breathe.
- Okay.

350
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:35,233
Don't drink my daughter's pee
if you can't handle it, you freak.

351
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,488
Yeah.

352
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,074
Yeah.

353
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:43,658
Thank you.

354
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,869
For what?

355
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:49,582
Just letting me
take care of you today.

356
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:56,589
Um...

357
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,258
Did you give me back my phone?

358
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,426
I can't find it.

359
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:02,552
I just...

360
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:03,803
- I don't see it.
- Uh...

361
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:04,889
No. I have it.

362
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:06,766
- Oh.
- Yeah.

363
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:09,810
- Yeah.
- Thanks, babe.

364
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:14,440
Why is it off?

365
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:22,781
I just wanted you
to have one day off, Nikki.

366
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,077
What?

367
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:31,791
Oh, my God. Noah, fuck you.

368
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,043
I don't get a day off.

369
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,295
- I don't want a day off.
- You're not sleeping.

370
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,589
You're on unemployment.
You don't see your friends.

371
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,716
- You never see me.
- Fuck you. Fuck you.

372
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,302
Oh, my God. Don't stand there
and act like you're a good guy.

373
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,721
Did you think what would happen
if she had had an emergency?

374
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:47,848
Her mom was there.

375
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:51,309
I am her family. She is my family.
Not you.

376
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,936
Do you wanna know the truth?

377
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:55,605
All I want to do is be with Molly.

378
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:57,316
I don't really care if I see you.

379
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,613
You're tired. And you're high.

380
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:05,825
No, I'm not. This is... I mean it.

381
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:10,245
The world without Molly in it
doesn't make sense. It's stupid.

382
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:14,750
You're telling me about your day,
and it's so stupid.

383
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,669
I'm watching my best friend die,

384
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:21,507
and you're telling me about how long
you had to wait for the fucking train?

385
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,635
I don't like being around you anymore.

386
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:32,059
Well, I don't like
being around you anymore either.

387
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:36,522
And that sucks 'cause you're
my favorite person in the whole world.

388
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:46,907
It's been really hard on us.

389
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,164
It's just been really hard, Nikki.

390
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:01,130
Am I drooling? Oh, God.

391
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:06,844
Am I drooling or am I crying?
What's happening on my face?

392
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:09,597
You're droo... I-It's both.

393
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:19,063
-  Hey.
- Hey. How's it going?

394
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,900
- All right.
-  Help!

395
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:24,652
- Help me! Please! Help!
-  Question.

396
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,613
Do you have, like, really big scissors?

397
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:28,908
Can someone help me?
Come on, please!

398
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,082
Who is that?

399
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:39,710
Oh, no one.

400
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:43,380
It's just my neighbor.
He's gonna cut off the collar, then go.

401
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,590
- I got it.
- Oh, thank God.

402
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:48,301
- Okay, I gotta go to urgent care.
- No. I really don't think you do.

403
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:50,178
Uh, thank you so much.
I-I think we're good now.

404
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:52,138
- You should stay. Have a cup of coffee.
- Mom.

405
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:53,765
Hey, maybe we can get together next week

406
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:55,934
- if I don't die. I don't know.
- Why would he die?

407
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:59,146
Because Molly peed on him
right after she had chemo.

408
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:03,983
Chemo?

409
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:06,235
Like, chemo for cancer?

410
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:07,695
Yeah.

411
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:08,781
Stage four.

412
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,958
Out. Out.

413
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:36,517
How dare you?

414
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:38,560
What?

415
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:42,981
How dare you tell him
anything about me?

416
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:45,859
What is the big deal about telling people?

417
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:48,862
Why does everything have to be a secret?

418
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:51,030
I'm helping you.

419
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,909
No, it's not helping me. It makes me feel...

420
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:56,954
like I'm...

421
00:24:58,122 --> 00:25:00,833
Fuck. I forgot the word
I was trying to say.

422
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,794
Fucking chemo brain.

423
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:06,880
What word is this?

424
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:11,342
Weird.

425
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,593
Oh, rag doll.

426
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:15,596
Little scary rag doll girl?

427
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:18,308
Broken. It makes me feel like I'm broken.

428
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:22,438
Hey, and I don't...
I don't want you here, okay?

429
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:25,107
Why are you doing this to me?

430
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:31,237
I'm not doing anything to you.
I am trying to...

431
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,698
Fuck my brain.

432
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:37,953
Glue.

433
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,124
Weave a basket?

434
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:45,377
Heal. I'm trying to heal.

435
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,421
I want you to heal.

436
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:49,881
That's why I'm helping you.

437
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:52,091
No, you don't help me. I-I...

438
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:56,305
Maybe I let you think that you help me
because that's what I've always done.

439
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:00,476
But I have to be
the one to protect you.

440
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:07,524
I'm the one who has to make sure you don't
take drugs and try and kill yourself.

441
00:26:10,778 --> 00:26:14,531
That was a very hard moment for me.

442
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:21,246
It was a hard moment for me.

443
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,083
I'm so sick of your guilt.

444
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:27,169
Like, every time you look at me,
you feel guilty.

445
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:30,756
I failed you.

446
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,759
I'm the one who left you alone
with that man.

447
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:41,016
While I was passed out down the hall
from whatever he put in my drink.

448
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,103
I'm the one who let him ruin you.

449
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:47,689
Stop it. I'm not ruined.

450
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:50,900
Okay? I don't blame you.

451
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:54,779
- You do blame me. You do.
- No. No. It's my fault too.

452
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,698
I saw him put something in your drink.

453
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:00,285
I saw him.

454
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:04,581
And I didn't say anything.

455
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:10,212
God.

456
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:14,215
You didn't know. You didn't know.

457
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:15,633
He smiled at me when he did it.

458
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:18,094
I liked that I had something
you didn't know about.

459
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:20,055
I liked that he chose me over you.

460
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,351
So it's not you, okay?

461
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:28,355
Well, it wasn't you.

462
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:31,733
Is that what you think?

463
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,319
Honey.

464
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:37,698
Honey, it wasn't you.

465
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:45,163
Well, maybe...
...we're not good for each other.

466
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:50,168
Maybe there's a way we could just
love each other but be apart.

467
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,631
Just...

468
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:56,675
Just, please.

469
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:03,140
I don't even care if you don't mean it.

470
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:10,105
Just tell me you forgive me, okay?

471
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:17,321
Forgive yourself.

472
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:22,618
Yeah.

473
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:26,538
Yeah.

474
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:39,592
What's his name?

475
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:40,677
Oh.

476
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,721
Ricky Mustache.

477
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,102
You have a meeting you can go to?

478
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:51,772
Yeah.

479
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:54,358
Okay.

480
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:40,320
I have stage four breast cancer.

481
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:44,074
And when I got hurt
and you had to call the ambulance,

482
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,451
um...

483
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:55,002
it was because the cancer that's in my hip
caused the bone to fracture.

484
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:56,795
Um,

485
00:29:57,546 --> 00:30:00,507
I left that part out. I, uh...

486
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:05,053
It doesn't have to be awkward.

487
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:07,597
Okay.

488
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:09,766
Let's just call it.

489
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:13,603
I had fun.

490
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:21,986
No.

491
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:25,157
What? Uh...

492
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:31,538
What? So...
What's this gonna be?

493
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:33,748
We're gonna have some tragic love story,

494
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:38,294
and we walk through a park in the autumn,
and I get a leaf caught in my hair.

495
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:40,797
And you're like,
"Whoa, you have a leaf in your hair."

496
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,925
And then I just fucking die.

497
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,265
No.

498
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:58,690
No leaves in your hair.

499
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:03,403
Just...

500
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:06,865
keep kicking me in the dick.

501
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:19,294
Yeah, I could do that.

502
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,263
Hey.

503
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:36,644
I left Noah.
And my mouth hurts so bad.

504
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:39,563
Come here. Come here. Come here.

505
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,943
Oh.
