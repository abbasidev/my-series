1
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:28,194
-  Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

2
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:30,864
Hey. Hi. Hi.

3
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:36,578
Jesus Christ.

4
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:39,413
Can I... Can I get some more blankets?

5
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,082
- Yeah. Are you family?
- Yes.

6
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:45,002
Um, why are her hands bolted down?

7
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,587
It's so she doesn't pull the tubes out.

8
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,548
We had to intubate her
after her lung collapsed.

9
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:50,383
Your lung collapsed?

10
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:52,969
- Oh, man! And in terms of her... Oh, my...
- Yeah.

11
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,762
What...

12
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:57,348
- What's on your hat?
- Excuse me?

13
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:59,642
Do you have <i>Harry Potter</i> lightning bolts
on your surgical hat?

14
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:04,146
- Yeah. Yup. Yup. Yup.
- What--

15
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,565
Are you in distress, Ms.--

16
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,942
- Can you hold that? Hold on one second?
- Okay.

17
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:11,362
Oh, my gosh. Okay.
You can just write it on there.

18
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:13,949
Sweetie.

19
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:17,995
Oh, my God.

20
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:20,497
Okay, I got you.

21
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:27,004
"Does he have a permission slip
from his parents to be here?"

22
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,090
Is... Is that...

23
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:32,341
Oh, she's talking about me.

24
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,760
She's... Okay.

25
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:37,222
A lot of adults like Harry Potter. I...

26
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:41,101
{\an8}I grew up with the movies.

27
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,862
I know you wanna
get that thing out,

28
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:54,739
but they said we have to wait
till tomorrow morning

29
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,366
to decide what to do next.

30
00:01:57,284 --> 00:02:03,372
And honestly, I've always thought
that you kind of talked a little too much.

31
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:06,501
So...
...now I can finally get a word in.

32
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,379
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,229
"Don't leave"?

34
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:28,690
What?

35
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,276
Why would I leave?

36
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:34,154
I have a captive audience.

37
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,490
Ha-ha. Okay.

38
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,326
Your choices for entertainment are...

39
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,414
the full script
of <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i>,

40
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:49,877
or everything that I can remember
from the movie <i>Clueless</i>,

41
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,379
which is a shocking amount.

42
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:56,802
"I am your spaniel. And Demetrius,
the more you beat me, I will fawn on you."

43
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:58,762
Oh...

44
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:00,972
So, Helena is a bottom.

45
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:06,852
"My plastic surgeon says I can't do any
activities where balls fly at my nose."

46
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,855
"Well, there goes your social life."

47
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:13,693
This is my impression of the language
that they call French.

48
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:23,369
Oh, one thumbs up.

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,128
Oh, double thumbs up.

50
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,131
Blink twice if you'd like
to watch me do some sports.

51
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,216
Sweet. Love - love.

52
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,764
Thumbs down. <i>Non, non, non.</i> We hate this.

53
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,851
"Oh my god. I love Josh."

54
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:49,979
Fountain. Fountain. Fountain.

55
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:54,108
"I'm majorly, totally,
butt-crazy in love with Josh.

56
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:56,486
But now I don't know
how to act around him."

57
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:59,738
That's such a good part.

58
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,907
The first night we hung out,

59
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,869
we stayed up all night
walking around.

60
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,247
And you were dating
my horrible acting teacher.

61
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,374
Yeah. He deserves it.

62
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:16,214
And you were so quiet and pretty
that I thought you must be dumb.

63
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,885
Honestly, it was a lot like this.

64
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,930
But then you really just blew me away.

65
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:35,400
Molly wants the breathing tube out.

66
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:39,695
- Are those vulvas?
- Yeah. They're vulvas wearing fancy hats.

67
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,323
They're going to the royal wedding.
I was, like, trying to make her laugh.

68
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:44,200
Can we just take that tube out?

69
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:46,952
- Nikki. Here's the thing. We--
- We can take it out now, but--

70
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,287
Great. Then let's just do that.

71
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,416
There's a risk that her body won't
remember how to breathe on its own.

72
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:55,085
What? What are you saying?

73
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,087
Sometimes the body just doesn't remember.

74
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,423
And Molly has
a Do Not Resuscitate order in place,

75
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,258
so if she stops breathing
or her heart stops,

76
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,052
then we would not perform CPR.

77
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:05,889
And as her health proxy,
you would need to okay that.

78
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,686
I've been awake for 30 hours.
I'm wearing toilet paper as underwear.

79
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:17,107
Are you asking me if I can let Molly
stop breathing in front of me?

80
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,318
Yes.

81
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,040
You're going to remember how to breathe.

82
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:39,172
Okay, Molly.
We're gonna do this together, okay?

83
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,634
We're gonna remove the tube,
and it's gonna feel a little weird.

84
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:46,596
But once it's out, I need you
to take a deep breath, okay?

85
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,642
Hand me a 10cc tube.
Ready the oxygen.

86
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,058
Yes!

87
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,268
Okay, great.

88
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,770
- Yes! Yes!
- Yes. Slow deep breaths. Deep breath.

89
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,857
- Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
- Yes!

90
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:40,901
Mwah!

91
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:42,903
Yes!

92
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,906
Was that your first kiss?

93
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,287
I've been kissed before. I...

94
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,706
- We know that, right?
-  Yeah. Of course. Yeah, sure.

95
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,216
Your neighbor brought you here.

96
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:10,262
I told him I loved him.

97
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,806
- You did?
- Yeah. I know.

98
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:17,019
Okay. So, now that
your breathing has stabilized,

99
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,189
I'm concerned
about this numbness you're feeling.

100
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,817
- We'll do a lumbar puncture--
- Hi, Jerry.

101
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:25,987
Hi, Molly.

102
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:29,866
May I sit down?

103
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:32,410
Please.

104
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:40,835
Tomorrow morning,

105
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:46,382
we would like to do a spinal tap
to see if the cancer has spread

106
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,385
to the lining of your spinal cord.

107
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:52,930
Now, do you have any questions?

108
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:55,557
Yes.

109
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,727
What will happen if you find cancer there?

110
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,981
Then we will have a conversation

111
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,527
about whether you wanna continue
with treatment.

112
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,034
Okay.

113
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,661
Thank you.

114
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:18,206
Yes. Let's do that.

115
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:20,709
Okay, good. All right.

116
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,127
I'll schedule it for, uh, tomorrow.

117
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:26,755
But you know, you... you're gonna need
some time after the procedure to recover.

118
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:33,053
And I just... I... I know that
you have certain, um, goals, physically.

119
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:36,890
And I just wanna make sure
that you're able to achieve them safely.

120
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:40,103
Whoa! I'm just... That's really...

121
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:44,566
Dr. P, are you saying that you want me
to be able to keep having sex?

122
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,234
I'm not made of stone.

123
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,653
Mm-hmm.

124
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:50,780
I don't know.

125
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:57,077
- Oh. What? Hell yes.
- Uh, I've never seen anything like that.

126
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,245
Does Jerry have game?

127
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,621
I'm gonna go give him a hug.

128
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,875
I'm wet from that. Like, is Jerry hot?

129
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,879
- Oh, my God. Nikki.
- Yes!

130
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:12,509
I wanna see him. I wanna see him again.
I wanna see him, like, right now.

131
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,720
Not Jerry, but your neighbor?

132
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:18,307
Are you, like, into Jerry now?

133
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:19,808
- No, you're not, right?
- Will you help me?

134
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,602
I wanna touch his mustache.

135
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:24,480
Oh, my God, yes! Of course!
Of course. Of course.

136
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,398
Um, I'll go home and get him.

137
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,275
I'm gonna get your vibrators,
I'll get your lube.

138
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,359
I got it. I got it.

139
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,197
Oh, my God!
"Come night. Come Romeo!"

140
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:37,034
"Come thou day in night."
I'm just, like... I'm doing Shakespeare!

141
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,994
- No, I know.
- I love Shakespeare.

142
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:42,082
- I know.
- I go. I go. Look how I go!

143
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,083
Don't die.

144
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,877
I won't.

145
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:57,555
What?

146
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,773
So there's a nice nurse and an evil nurse?

147
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,109
Yeah, we need to get there
before the shift change.

148
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,277
Did you put the bag
with the lubes in the car?

149
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,071
- Yeah.
- And the bag with the vibrators?

150
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,157
- Oh, my God! Where's my phone?
- Yeah.

151
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,118
Why would I know where your phone is?

152
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,745
And why does she need all that stuff?
How long is she gonna be in there?

153
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,705
I don't know. I never know.

154
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:26,333
So she could be in there
a few days or forever?

155
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,753
And we're just supposed to live
in both realities?

156
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,256
- That's really fucked.
- Yeah.

157
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:35,009
Well, it feels different this time.

158
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:41,223
Well, I think you're amazing. I mean,
I watch you, and you do everything.

159
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:42,642
Well, not everything.

160
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,102
But, you know, if I could have sex
with her, I would.

161
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:49,022
Yeah. I bet.
I mean, it's really cool...

162
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,027
...to have sex with her. I love it.

163
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:54,946
This is weird.

164
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:58,866
This? It's just human sexuality.

165
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:02,035
Ooh! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Yes!

166
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:04,872
Whoo! [screams, groans] Oh, yes!

167
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:05,998
<i>Nikki?</i>

168
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,916
Oh, shit! Did I pick this up?

169
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,545
<i>Uh, yeah. You did. Hi.</i>

170
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,173
<i>Uh...</i>

171
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:16,758
Hi, Noah.

172
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,510
- <i>Um...</i>
- Uh.

173
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,137
I'm calling 'cause I got
a medical bill for Molly,

174
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,014
and I wanted to let you know.

175
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:25,350
It's so nice to hear from you.
It's so good to hear from you.

176
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,020
<i>It's just, um...
Molly's in the hospital.</i>

177
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,397
<i>I had them take her off the ventilator,
but she's okay.</i>

178
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,608
I'm... My God! Oh, my God!

179
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,109
<i>No!</i>

180
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,360
- Shit!
- No, man!

181
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,946
No, no, no, no.
You cannot. Oh, Jesus.

182
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,615
- We need everything in there.
- What you doing, man?

183
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,200
- No! No, no, no, no!
- We're going to the hospital.

184
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,451
Get off the fucking car!

185
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,203
Do something! Don't you work for 311?

186
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:47,122
Yeah, but that's not related to parking!

187
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:50,083
- Yeah. I'm 311. So you can't do this--
- Get the fuck off the car!

188
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:54,087
- He's 311. No, no, no, no. Oh, my God!
- Jesus! I'm gonna fuck you up with forms!

189
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,339
No!

190
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,090
<i>Nikki, what</i>... <i>what</i>...<i>what's happening?</i>

191
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,926
Noah, why are you still on the phone?

192
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:00,260
You haven't hung up yet.

193
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,888
- No! They're towing my car.
- Oh, fuck!

194
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,641
My car. My car.

195
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:09,854
<i>My suitcase and my tote
and all of Molly's stuff is in the car.</i>

196
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,064
- My car.
- Come here.

197
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:15,067
Don't... No. Please don't hug me.
We're not friends.

198
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,027
I mean, we're not strangers.

199
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:18,655
-  <i>Who's hugging you?</i>
- Get on the subway.

200
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,489
Okay.

201
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,159
<i>Nikki, what can I do? Let me do something.</i>

202
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,794
Okay. I need help.

203
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:36,255
I need help.

204
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,716
What is lost is found.

205
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:41,802
What man could resist me
in these beefy unders?

206
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:46,348
Come on. Do you want to know
where I got this deodorant?

207
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:47,599
-  Oh, no. No.
- That's what I thought.

208
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,187
Are there any, like,
sluttier hospital gowns lying around?

209
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:55,524
Just turn it around backwards.
You know, easy access.

210
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,860
Yeah, but what else do you need?
What else was in Nikki's car?

211
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:01,321
- We got--
- Everything. Like, literally everything.

212
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,406
Okay.

213
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:04,158
Is it strange how calm I feel?

214
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:07,244
I don't know what's going on with me.
I just feel so clear.

215
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:10,039
Like my mind feels clear.

216
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,751
I'm really proud of you.

217
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:18,046
What? I am. I am. I just...

218
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,965
Hey, I need to warn you about Ernie,
the night nurse--

219
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,801
You can warn her all you want.

220
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,261
- I'm putting a stop to this.
- That's Ernie.

221
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:26,930
There will be no male visitors tonight.
Not on my watch.

222
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,724
This is a hospital, not a bordello.

223
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:29,850
Ernie!

224
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:32,102
What kinda man takes advantage
of a sick woman like this?

225
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,647
Oh, no one's taking advantage
of me, Ernie.

226
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,153
Haven't you ever been in love?

227
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,781
That's none of your business.

228
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,452
That's a yes.

229
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:55,293
Hi.

230
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,170
Hi.

231
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,757
Welcome.

232
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,638
- Would you like to use my bedside commode?
- Um...

233
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,349
Not yet.

234
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,021
I have a tube in my--

235
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,398
It's fucking hot.

236
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,028
You're so beautiful.

237
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,572
You're so beautiful.

238
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,533
I got you a gift.

239
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:35,249
It's really expensive,
and I had to hunt high and low for them.

240
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:37,960
Taco socks.

241
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:40,337
I just...
You know, I know your feet get cold.

242
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:42,924
And who doesn't love tacos?

243
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,260
I hate these taco socks.

244
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,846
They make me sick.

245
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,187
Look at their little taco faces.

246
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:00,274
Why is only one of them
wearing sunglasses?

247
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:04,403
Is the lettuce supposed
to be the taco's hair?

248
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,740
I didn't think
I could hate shredded lettuce

249
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,075
any more than I already do,

250
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:13,287
but looking at it on these taco socks
fills me with rage.

251
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:18,709
If they say, "Let's taco about it,"
I'm gonna scream.

252
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,920
Well, don't look at the heel then.

253
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:25,883
Take off your clothes.

254
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,019
Come here.

255
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,740
Get on the bed.

256
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,785
Oh, my God!
You're so tall.

257
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:57,414
Hey. What's happening?
What's happening?

258
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:59,499
- It's okay. It's okay. He's here.
- He's here.

259
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,043
- He is...
- He's here? He's here.

260
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:02,544
Oh, God.

261
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:06,549
-  Don't come in!
-  She's okay. I'm also fine.

262
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:12,346
I have a boner.

263
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:14,640
Turn and face the wall, you little perv!

264
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,687
How about he stays that way
till the morning?

265
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:23,273
Actually, my friend might be coming soon
with a bag of vibrators.

266
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:25,359
Those are for me.

267
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,445
I'll get right on that.

268
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,363
Excuse me.

269
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,578
- Hi.
- Hi.

270
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,038
Uh, I tried to get the stuff,

271
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,165
but, um, you didn't tell me
what kind of vibrator Molly likes.

272
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:43,210
Yes, I did. Clitoral stimulation,
no dildos. I did tell you that.

273
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:44,628
Yeah, but what kind
of clitoral stimulation?

274
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:46,588
Oh, my God!
I thought you hadn't bought anything.

275
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:47,881
- Of course I did.
- Thank you.

276
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:49,466
I-I couldn't answer the questions
they were asking.

277
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:50,967
Does she like direct,
rhythmic stimulation?

278
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,135
'Cause that one's good for that.

279
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,720
- This one is good for orbiting.
- Orbiting?

280
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:57,558
Yeah, orbiting. It's like when you make
small, gentle circles around the clitoris.

281
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,559
Cool.

282
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,479
Some women don't want you to, like,
touch their clitoris at all.

283
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,564
They just want you to, like...

284
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,025
- I'm saying clitoris a lot.
- It's cool.

285
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,445
They just want you to, like,
lightly touch all the skin around it.

286
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:16,202
And then this one is shaped like a rose.
It's called the "Marilyn."

287
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,664
Not to sound ungrateful,
but I think this is a...

288
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:22,332
I think this is a butthole.

289
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,042
Oh, I thought it was a rose.

290
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,336
Okay. Um, thank you.

291
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:27,421
Sure.

292
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:33,051
Well, um, I will deliver these
because it was a vibrator emergency.

293
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:36,305
I'm just gonna hang out
and wait till the rain lets up.

294
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,724
Thank you. Thank you.

295
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:45,856
Oh, I forgot. I got you soup.
It's, uh, the mushroom kind that you like.

296
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,441
Fuck!

297
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:51,612
I appreciate that. That's really nice.

298
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:55,699
I'll come back to make some circles
around that soup.

299
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,410
I hate myself.

300
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:04,542
We've never kissed before.

301
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:07,753
I'd like to kiss you.

302
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,677
Is it okay to take that off?

303
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:16,762
It's just oxygen.

304
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,274
My lips are so dry.

305
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:58,929
What if all I can do
is just lie here with you?

306
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,559
I don't know what you thought
this was going to be.

307
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:09,898
Because there's been so much build up
and there are just so many vibrators.

308
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:11,651
We don't have to do anything.

309
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,321
And you're right.

310
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,369
What's with all these vibrators?
Get outta here. Freaking us out.

311
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:23,912
Holy shit!

312
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,080
- Did you see that?
- What?

313
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,505
I think what I'm gonna do
is just smell you.

314
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:34,715
Okay.

315
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,514
Yeah. 'Cause we don't have to do anything.

316
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,351
Yeah. There's too many goals.

317
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:50,314
We live in a society that just...
Everybody's goals.

318
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,776
I, um...

319
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,112
Christ, I'm distracted.

320
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,823
I was saying something about goals.

321
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,992
Goals are dumb, you know? We don't...

322
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,578
Who needs 'em?

323
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:07,664
I fucking...

324
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:10,291
And then when you achieve one,
then what are you gonna do?

325
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,961
Another goal? Fuck!

326
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:14,547
Oh, God! Hey, listen, um...

327
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:18,092
I think... I think, um...

328
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:20,510
I think what we do need to do...

329
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:24,390
We both need to agree
that it is not medically safe...

330
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:28,602
for you to have
any sexual satisfaction tonight.

331
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:31,313
I mean, you absolutely cannot come.

332
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:33,566
Oh, I agree.

333
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:37,820
- No, I'm much too weak and too sick.
- Yeah.

334
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,365
But then I don't think
I can let you come either.

335
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,617
- Oh, no. Certainly not.
- No.

336
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,874
Then why are you so hard right now?

337
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,210
I'm not... It's the railing.

338
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:58,591
There's a railing
in the middle of the bed?

339
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:01,634
Fuck!

340
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,018
Do you think you could eat that
a little faster?

341
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:15,900
Don't look over here.

342
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:17,985
I won't.

343
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,280
Are you engaged?

344
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,325
What?

345
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:28,037
You heard what I said.

346
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:31,372
Are you engaged? To be married?

347
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,625
- No.
- Okay.

348
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:35,460
Okay.

349
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:38,756
I saw something on Instagram,
and you were wearing a ring.

350
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:41,883
I got really into rings
for a little while.

351
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,554
I'm not kidding.

352
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:48,265
You and I had just ended it,
and I was like...

353
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,352
I was kinda heartbroken and, um...

354
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,189
I bought, like, 20 rings in two months.

355
00:21:56,398 --> 00:22:00,652
- Sweet, man.  Was it just rings?
-  Yeah.

356
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,320
I had one really bad night.

357
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,239
I bought a few bracelets and a toe ring.

358
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,574
And I just wore it around
the apartment for, like, a week.

359
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:13,082
Nikki.

360
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:14,834
Yeah.

361
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,588
I'm with someone.

362
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:22,967
And it's nice.

363
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:26,887
It's easy.

364
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,233
Thank you for the soup.

365
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,710
Okay. Okay. No. I... I have to stop.

366
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:01,629
I have to stop
because you are making noises

367
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,799
that make me think that you're starting
to get physically aroused and--

368
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,843
What makes you think
I'm physically aroused?

369
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:10,054
I mean, your pupils are like saucers
and you're grunting.

370
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,974
Oh, no. That's just what I do
when I'm bored.

371
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:16,769
I see.

372
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,314
I mean, you could try touching me.

373
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,067
I don't think I can feel anything.

374
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:28,198
Uh, no.

375
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:30,242
I don't feel anything.

376
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:33,495
No. I don't feel anything.

377
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:36,999
No, still nothing.

378
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,293
- Really?
-  No.

379
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,712
Are you even touching me right now?

380
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:44,464
I am touching you right now.

381
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,681
Gentle.

382
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:55,893
Yeah. Up and down.

383
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:14,620
I'm here.

384
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:17,206
I'm here.

385
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,844
Molly. Fuck!

386
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,639
I forgot to play Wordle today.

387
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:36,433
I'm so sorry.

388
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:39,769
I always start with "gnome."

389
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,897
I always start with "Fuck you."

390
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:47,902
Obviously, you're the most beautiful thing
that ever happened,

391
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:52,408
but I've never liked that your hair
isn't filled with lube.

392
00:24:58,914 --> 00:24:59,915
Oh, yeah.

393
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,255
I was right.

394
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,471
This is my masterpiece.

395
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:25,941
Okay. Now I can fuck the top of your head
like I've always wanted to.

396
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,824
Hey, do you wanna see my boobs?

397
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,368
Yeah!

398
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:44,543
They're so cool.

399
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:46,879
Thanks.

400
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:48,964
They're pretty cool.

401
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,925
I don't have much feeling in them anymore.

402
00:25:57,514 --> 00:26:00,725
I can feel that.

403
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:04,188
- What about here?
- No. No, not so much.

404
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:07,315
- Okay. I'm gonna be very thorough.
- Yeah, no.

405
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:09,943
That's not really working for me.
I just...

406
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,240
Can you use your tongue?

407
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:20,370
I mean, if I have to.

408
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,735
Touch it. Touch it. Use your mouth.

409
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,881
Here's your vitamin E, Molly.

410
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:16,218
Finger.

411
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,140
Bracelet.

412
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:26,727
Your blood pressure is elevated.

413
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,438
And your leg looks fucked up.

414
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,356
You're killing me, Ernie.

415
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,441
Uh-huh.

416
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:38,198
Do you think he noticed?

417
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:41,909
Wait. For real, why... why are you stopping?

418
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:45,079
It's... It's the responsible thing to do.

419
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,331
I hate you.

420
00:27:47,124 --> 00:27:50,335
I hate you so much.

421
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,718
I need you.

422
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:43,198
- Hey, you want it?
- Yes.

423
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:09,534
They're gonna come tap my spine
in an hour.

424
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:12,079
I'll stay.

425
00:31:12,913 --> 00:31:13,914
No.

426
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:18,168
Okay. I'll come back tonight.

427
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:21,088
No.

428
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,844
I don't wanna die with you.

429
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,973
I wanna get a dog with you.

430
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:41,024
So, you just used me to get off,

431
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:43,985
and now you're done with me?

432
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:47,197
Yeah.

433
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:50,408
Yeah.

434
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:04,172
This is going to be a blip for you.

435
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,341
No.

436
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:09,094
No.

437
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:17,435
Will you stay till after I fall asleep?

438
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:21,857
Okay.

439
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:51,970
- Hi.
- Hi.

440
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:56,183
He left.

441
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,370
"Oh, my God.

442
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:22,876
I love Josh. I love Josh."

443
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:25,461
Fountain. Fountain.

444
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:31,008
Oh, my God! It happened? Oh, my God.
I'm so happy, I'm gonna come, I swear.

445
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:36,431
I'm gonna cry. You should've called me
right when it happened.

446
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,103
Hi.

447
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:50,946
Ready?
