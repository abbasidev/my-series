1
00:00:06,632 --> 00:00:08,342
Okay.

2
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,141
Yeah.

3
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:28,612
Okay. Okay.

4
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,864
After you talk to her,
I will discuss some options.

5
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,616
Okay. Are you, uh--

6
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:34,742
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah?

7
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:35,827
It's my job.

8
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,880
I'll need a second.

9
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:54,221
-  Oh, man.
-  He can talk.

10
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:57,556
- Yeah.
-  Hi.

11
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:58,724
- Hi.
- Hi.

12
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:01,727
I'm Amy.

13
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,230
- Hi. Sorry.
- Hi.

14
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,732
Well, now that Dr. Pankowitz
has talked to you,

15
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:09,778
I'm here to talk to you about hospice.

16
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,370
What do you mean a hospice?

17
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:25,167
Has Dr. Pankowitz...

18
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,253
Shoot.

19
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:28,422
Eh, shoot, shoot. Um--

20
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:30,966
You know what? Don't worry about it.

21
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:33,884
I'm gonna come back later. How about that?

22
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,014
Hi. There was
a little misunderstanding and,

23
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:39,599
I'm not gonna sugarcoat it, I boned this.

24
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,560
Oh, Jesus, Amy!

25
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:43,895
Molly. Hey.

26
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:46,064
I'm so sorry you found out this way.

27
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:48,734
Hi.

28
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:50,736
Hi, Molly.

29
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:52,987
Dr. P.

30
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:56,240
Uh, we got the results
from the lumbar puncture,

31
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:59,785
and they showed that the cancer has spread

32
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,872
to the lining of your spinal cord
and your brain.

33
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:05,709
So you failed?

34
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:07,335
You said five years.

35
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:08,961
- I didn't.
- He didn't.

36
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,923
I think we're looking at a few weeks
to a few months.

37
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:15,301
But we could still do
another round of chemotherapy.

38
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,053
We could do... We could do...

39
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:19,765
What the fuck... Immunotherapy.

40
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,476
If that's what you want.

41
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:28,940
I ca... I can't do that.

42
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,277
Okay.

43
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:37,115
- Okay?
- Yeah.

44
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,746
I can come back at better time.

45
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:47,292
Well, fuck, Amy.

46
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,211
Now we need you.

47
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:06,060
Goodbye, Jerry. Thank you.

48
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:07,270
Bye, Molly.

49
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,105
- Bye, Nikki.
- See you around.

50
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:10,190
Yeah.

51
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,429
Ooh, welcome.

52
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:43,640
Let me know
if I can help you with anything.

53
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:47,226
You gals like puzzles? Or books?

54
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,479
I got so many art supplies.

55
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,647
Hey, you can put anything
on the walls too.

56
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,232
Just don't drill into 'em.

57
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,860
Yeah.
We didn't bring a drill to hospice.

58
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:57,112
Oh, you'd be surprised.

59
00:03:58,363 --> 00:03:59,656
You'd be surprised.

60
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:06,455
Hey.

61
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,623
You have the power here.

62
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,919
You tell Amy what you wanna feel and when.

63
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,005
What I want to feel.

64
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,850
Thank you.

65
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,102
Thank you.

66
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:40,489
I want a different room.

67
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,490
I wanna change rooms.

68
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:44,909
Hmm. I think they're all
pretty much the same,

69
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,660
but we can make this good.

70
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:47,787
We can decorate.

71
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,663
Not that painting.

72
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,415
That painting's screwed on.

73
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,542
I think it's a masterwork,

74
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:57,713
but why don't you tell me what you think
is worst part of this gorgeous painting?

75
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:58,882
The fishermen.

76
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,800
No, it's the boat.

77
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:01,885
Hmm.

78
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,596
Actually, the fish.

79
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:07,139
Why are there so many fish?

80
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,519
Such an in-your-face, like,
obscene amount of fish.

81
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,650
I think my mom is calling.

82
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:19,236
My phone's not ringing.

83
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,281
Hmm.

84
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:28,995
- Is it--
- Oh, my God!

85
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:30,956
How did you know that?

86
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:33,500
I think I'm starting to be magic.

87
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:35,669
I believe it.

88
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:42,926
Mom, hi.

89
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:46,137
I'm in hospice.

90
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,265
Okay. Okay.

91
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,518
I, uh... I'm here if you need me.

92
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:56,064
You just tell me
when you need me. I'm nearby.

93
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,023
Where are you?

94
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,235
I'm in the lobby.

95
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,404
Of the hospital?

96
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:06,198
- Yes.
- Of this hospital?

97
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,411
I'm in the lobby.
How many times do I have to say it?

98
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:11,872
Where else was I going to be?

99
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:16,626
I want you here, Mom.

100
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,881
- Hi, there. Are you--
- Gail. My name is Gail.

101
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:29,014
Mom!

102
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:34,895
Mom.

103
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,444
Oh, baby girl.

104
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:44,905
My baby girl.

105
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,170
Hey.

106
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,546
That kid over there was wondering

107
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:05,550
if he could play with that puzzle
for a little while.

108
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,011
No.

109
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:12,849
No. Okay. I'll tell him that.

110
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:16,311
She wants to stick with it.

111
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,021
Is she dying?

112
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,231
No.

113
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,024
But neither are you.

114
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:24,318
Neither am I, so let's just be cool.

115
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,403
How about search a word?

116
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,993
Hi, Gail. I'm just...

117
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,329
I just need to get my bag.

118
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:40,376
The nurse is gonna bring a cot in
so I can sleep here.

119
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:42,295
Oh, good, Gail.

120
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,883
Well, I'll just be in the, um...

121
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,386
the waiting room finishing my puzzle.

122
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,972
- Nikki.
- Yeah.

123
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,351
What you've done for her...

124
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:58,436
Oh...

125
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:09,655
Uh, who's taking care of your dogs
while you're gone?

126
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,408
Scotty, my lover.

127
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:19,249
Would you... Would you like
to finish your puzzle in here?

128
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,047
This is cheese.

129
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,717
This is lemon.

130
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:32,386
Lemon! No, cheese.

131
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:35,097
This is sun.

132
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:37,099
We're gonna have
to start another pile for the sun.

133
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,183
I'll do sun.

134
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,227
Okay, good. And can you also do the mouse?

135
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,814
Oh, I'd love to do the mouse. Thank you.

136
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,072
What happened to your hair?

137
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:52,656
What?

138
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,785
- Wait, is there something weird about it?
- Yeah.

139
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,079
Oh, my God! What did you do to me?

140
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,415
It wasn't me, man!

141
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,459
It just seems like you might
be coming down with something.

142
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,253
- She always wanted pink hair.
- She wouldn't let me.

143
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,047
It looks dope.

144
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,132
Thank you.

145
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,010
So, as you are filling out those forms,

146
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:16,389
who would like to hear
about what happens when you're dying?

147
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:19,768
That's good enough for me.

148
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:24,856
Death is not a mystery.
It is not a medical disaster.

149
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,776
It is a bodily process,

150
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,402
like giving birth,

151
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,114
or like going to the bathroom,
or coughing,

152
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:34,741
having an orgasm.

153
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,161
'Cause your body knows what to do.

154
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,330
Your body knows how to die!

155
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,956
How cool is that?

156
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,752
Okay. Here's what to expect.

157
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:49,464
In the last month of your life,
you're gonna stop getting out of bed.

158
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:53,343
You're gonna to eat and drink a lot less,
and you're gonna sleep a lot more.

159
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,677
Uh, delirium is common.

160
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:58,223
And some people say
they get this feeling like...

161
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,974
time stops being real.

162
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,976
Is that something
that you've been feeling?

163
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,603
- Yes!
- Yes.

164
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,688
Okay. Two to three weeks out,

165
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,067
you're gonna need help
with all daily activities.

166
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,777
But my favorite part
of the dying process is--

167
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:12,986
Amy!

168
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:16,657
I know. I've been talked to
about my enthusiasm.

169
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,075
I should dial it back. Sorry.

170
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:19,910
It doesn't work for me right now.

171
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:21,370
Should I keep going?

172
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,706
Yeah. But will you hold my hand?

173
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:36,302
Your body knows what's coming
and it goes into a state of ketosis,

174
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,429
which decreases hunger and pain

175
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,767
and it increases the sense of euphoria.

176
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:44,935
And when you start active dying--

177
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:46,728
What's active dying?

178
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,940
Oh, active dying is a sacred time.

179
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:53,027
At least it used to be, and it still is
in some parts of the world.

180
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,029
It's the moment
when you're very close to death,

181
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,699
and your body starts shutting down.

182
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,076
How's everyone doing?

183
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,745
I'm looking at you, Gail.

184
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:07,250
If, uh, Molly wants to hear it,

185
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:09,626
I can hear it.

186
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,504
You guys, come here.

187
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,809
I'm good. I'm good. I'm good.

188
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,979
In active dying,
you won't be fully conscious.

189
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,981
And your jaw muscles will relax.

190
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:33,400
Your breathing changes.

191
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:36,279
And there might be this gurgling
at the back of your throat,

192
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,200
caused by something, unfortunately,
called terminal secretions.

193
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,037
I know.

194
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,168
And when you are very close to death,

195
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:57,050
your breathing goes into a cycle
of deep slow breaths and long pauses.

196
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:01,012
And then eventually, there's a breath out...

197
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:03,932
that is not followed by a breath in.

198
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:06,226
And that's it.

199
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,483
- Hey.
- Yeah, yeah.

200
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,402
Can you make sure
that my mouth isn't open when I die?

201
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,780
Okay.

202
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,908
Just don't bite me.

203
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,743
Why would I bite you?

204
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,537
I don't know
why I need you to tell me this,

205
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,374
but please say that you won't bite me.

206
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,500
How long have you had that fear?

207
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:32,709
I understand that you would not.

208
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,879
It's very intense in here.
I... It's an irrational fear!

209
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,215
Okay. And at a certain time,

210
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:40,343
if you're just feeling too weak or...

211
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,762
you know, too much pain
or you're just done,

212
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:47,849
you can talk to me about sedating you,
but then you'll be unconscious.

213
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,560
I-I wanna feel everything
for as long as I can.

214
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,812
Okay, good.

215
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:53,772
Wait, I forgot to tell you
about the rally!

216
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,066
God! Jesus!

217
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,025
The last week of life,

218
00:12:57,026 --> 00:13:00,280
some people experience
what's called the rally.

219
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:04,742
And it's this just surge
of energy and mental clarity.

220
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:06,995
So enjoy the rally.

221
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:12,083
Just know that you're another step
closer to death, okay?

222
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,420
I fucking love your vibe, Amy!

223
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,172
You're nuts, man!

224
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,518
I didn't know
if you were gonna wanna see me.

225
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,272
Honestly,

226
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,107
I just like making you cry.

227
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,156
Cool.

228
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,368
You in pain?

229
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,082
Yeah.

230
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,713
I had a lot of stuff
that I wanted to tell you in here,

231
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:01,549
but I'm blanking on everything.

232
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:07,555
Um, Beth is pregnant.

233
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,183
Oh, that's so good.

234
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,560
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

235
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,564
I've been reading a lot of baby books.

236
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:19,858
And did you know for the first few months

237
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:23,362
they think everything they see
is a part of them?

238
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:25,322
Isn't that wild?

239
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:27,365
Like, they don't know
the difference between themselves

240
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,826
and the rest of the world.

241
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,079
Wow. Yeah, I like that.

242
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:33,915
Yeah.

243
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:35,833
Me too.

244
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,390
Hey!

245
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,601
Hey, Johnny!

246
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,312
The fish are really biting today, huh?

247
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:43,276
Time to get all these goddamn fish!

248
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:52,200
- Molly.
- Molly.

249
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,536
Molly. Hi.

250
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,875
Oh.

251
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,796
Oh, bye, little fella.

252
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,549
Mom!

253
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,801
Look at this!

254
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:10,635
Wake up.

255
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,053
Mom, wake up!

256
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,138
Wake up!

257
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,891
Molly, I'm here!

258
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:17,726
-  Molly.
- Mom.

259
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,771
- Good morning, Molly.
- I've got your morning pills...

260
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,773
- Good morning, Molly.
- ...check on your blood pressure.

261
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,275
- ...your left arm.
- Molly, over here!

262
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:35,744
Time isn't real

263
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,913
It's a circle

264
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:41,666
You're gonna die pretty soon

265
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,976
I've been having these visions.

266
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:05,273
Like, shit is flying off the walls
and rotating around the room.

267
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,942
Wow!

268
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:10,278
Like, it felt like I was unlinking
or something.

269
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,365
Like from the world?

270
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:16,701
Yeah, and also from, like, time?

271
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,036
Hmm.

272
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,205
Like...

273
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:22,999
I think everything exists at once.

274
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,044
Like, I'm talking to you,

275
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,880
but I'm also talking
to every version of you I've ever known.

276
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,966
And it's all in the room with me.

277
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:32,051
Holy shit.

278
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:36,264
Like the version of me from 2009
when I got the same hairstyle as you?

279
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:38,599
Yeah.

280
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:41,560
Is it scary?

281
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:42,645
No.

282
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:45,982
I can see how much pain she's in.

283
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:48,150
What should I do?

284
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:49,944
Well, take a breath.

285
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:54,322
'Cause it is very common
for people to hold on

286
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,199
when they're waiting
for something to resolve

287
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,454
or they're just concerned about
causing their loved one a lot of pain.

288
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,332
You think she's worried about you?

289
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:07,920
No.

290
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:11,799
Not me.

291
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,552
I just wish I could see into the future.

292
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,887
I wish I could see you when you're old.

293
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:21,224
Oh, that? I mean,
we're basically almost there.

294
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:24,311
That's gonna be exactly
whatever you think it's gonna be.

295
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:29,691
It's like, "Oh, hello.
I take art classes at the museum,

296
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:32,987
and I have loose mints
that are rolling around in my purse.

297
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:36,448
And I... My breath smells like crayons,

298
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:40,452
and my farts sound like little marbles
being dropped on a floor."

299
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,083
I wish...

300
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,919
I wish you could be there for that too.

301
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,307
Did you call Noah yet to tell him?

302
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,559
No. I'm...

303
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,978
No.

304
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,397
Oh, hey.

305
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,357
I just matched with someone.

306
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:12,943
Oh. Whew. Just in the nick of time.

307
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,487
Oh.

308
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:16,572
Look at that.

309
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:18,156
"What are you up to?"

310
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:22,036
Um, funny that you asked.

311
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:24,246
Where have you been all my life?

312
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,258
Yeah.

313
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:42,431
This is a corner piece. Yes!

314
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,432
And that's for me.

315
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,559
Hey.

316
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:47,478
Hi.

317
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:51,147
What's... What are you doing here?

318
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,358
Gail called me.

319
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,276
Molly wanted me
to play percussion for her.

320
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,738
Gail said she's been listening
to a lot of classical music.

321
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,658
-  Hey, man.
- Hey.

322
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,451
- I don't want to put this on you...
- I thought it would be a nice surprise.

323
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,745
...but it is actually insane
what is going on here.

324
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,330
She broke into my phone.

325
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,708
Guilty. I used her face.

326
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,710
- Mom.
- While I was sleeping, she did that to me.

327
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:14,671
Is this real, or am I hallucinating again?
I hope it's real.

328
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:17,132
And her master plan was
to get in touch with Noah

329
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:20,009
and then she wanted me
to get back together with him,

330
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,261
so that you would be happy.

331
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:22,762
I'm not... I'm not really sure.

332
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:23,973
Mom.

333
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:27,183
You said you would
be respectful of boundaries.

334
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,852
With you, not Nikki.

335
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:30,061
Oh, my God.

336
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,858
She thinks that you're worried
about leaving me alone.

337
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:39,237
If that's the case,
you can completely not worry about me.

338
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:43,783
Like, I am gonna be okay,
and I'm cool. Like, I'm good.

339
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,744
Just don't,
don't even keep that in your mind.

340
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:47,704
I'm not... I'm good. I'm okay.

341
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:49,539
Okay, well, I hope not that okay.

342
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:53,836
Noah.

343
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,547
I'm sorry
that I asked her to do this with me

344
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:59,799
right when you were beginning
to make a life together.

345
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,635
Oh, I'm not sorry.

346
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,054
She loves you.

347
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:06,640
With everything that she has.

348
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,684
I'm not sorry about that.

349
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,437
I think that you should break up
with your girlfriend.

350
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:13,521
It's my dying wish.

351
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,982
Whoa. Don't break up with your girlfriend.
That's... I don't--

352
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,650
You should break up with your girlfriend

353
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,986
or I'll haunt the shit out of you
in your dreams.

354
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,571
- Why is everyone being insane?
- We broke up.

355
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:23,072
Oh, Okay.

356
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,158
Oh.

357
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:25,784
Yeah.

358
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:26,951
- When did you break up?
- Gail...

359
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:27,952
When did you break up?

360
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,872
Um, like a week ago. So...

361
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:31,790
Hmm.

362
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,458
- Yeah, I didn't... That doesn't mean...
- Oh, no.

363
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:34,709
I know. Of course not.

364
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,836
I didn't come to hospice today
trying to hook up.

365
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,297
That's not... No.

366
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,258
You've got a big instrument.

367
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:44,135
- Oh, God.
- Yeah. Thanks, Gail.

368
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,471
Um... You wanna see what I can do with it?

369
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:47,639
- No.
- No.

370
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,557
No.

371
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,942
If you gotta go, you can...
You don't have to...

372
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:01,403
- Or you can wait. Okay.
- I want to.

373
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:10,704
I...

374
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:15,209
I didn't think that I was capable...

375
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,045
of loving someone this much.

376
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:24,718
But I know I can now.

377
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,056
It's nice.

378
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,017
Yeah, that's how I felt
when Winter was born.

379
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,687
- Hmm.
- It's crazy. It's... Yeah.

380
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:37,106
Yeah.

381
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:42,277
For me, it's like I'm never gonna be there
at the start of someone's life,

382
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:43,696
like at the beginning.

383
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,659
But I am gonna be there at the end.

384
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:54,915
And I'm just gonna love this person
right up until the end.

385
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:58,752
That's amazing, Nikki.

386
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:07,928
Probably go ahead and love you too.

387
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,355
FYI.

388
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:23,485
Got it.

389
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,872
Oof.

390
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:50,179
That's him.

391
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,807
I don't wanna go,
but I got a five-star rating,

392
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:55,935
and I'm not gonna fuck with that.

393
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:58,269
- I understand.
- Yeah, I know.

394
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,355
I know you do.

395
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:01,774
Walk me out?

396
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:10,114
I wasn't in the running,
I wasn't in the race

397
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,492
You move in a way
That I've known before

398
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:15,453
Now I want your love, heart and soul

399
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:18,665
-  Tired eyes, tears that dried 
-  Leaving you ain't easy now

400
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:21,459
-  On the bed where the love has died 
-  Loving you's the harder part

401
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,836
-  Through the door you go
-  You never want me for myself

402
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,506
Now I've needed you right
From the very start

403
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:28,508
Everything you said was to the point

404
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:31,844
-  Oh, won't you even try to? 
-  Can't you try to?

405
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:34,555
Give a little bit of heart and soul

406
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,849
Give a little bit of love to grow

407
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,352
Give a little bit of heart and soul

408
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:42,605
And don't you make me beg for more

409
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:45,109
Give a sign, I need to know

410
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:48,069
A little bit of heart and soul

411
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,654
Whoa.

412
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,323
What is going on here?

413
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:53,950
It's the rally!

414
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:55,827
We think it's the rally.

415
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:58,246
That was the heart
Of the love we shared

416
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:00,581
-  Do you keep a secret left untold? 
-  Is all that I need

417
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:03,334
Can't give love, heart or soul

418
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:06,087
I used to have a lover
With a Midas touch

419
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:08,881
I turned to gold but he turned to dust

420
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:11,092
Left me for another, I turned to stone

421
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:14,220
Now give me love, heart and soul

422
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:17,390
-  Tired eyes, tears that dried 
-  Living in a fantasy

423
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:20,268
There's never any room to breathe

424
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:22,520
Hoping every waking hour

425
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,939
You'll turn around
And say that we can start

426
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,108
Everything you did just said it all

427
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:30,570
-  Oh, won't you even try to? 
-  Can't you try to?

428
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:33,239
Give a little bit of heart and soul

429
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,909
Give a little bit of love to grow

430
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,219
How's the water, honey?

431
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,223
It's good.

432
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,517
I'm gonna be outside.

433
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,478
The labor and delivery nurse
told me you have 20 minutes,

434
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:06,106
and then a rich person's gonna
come have a baby in here.

435
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:09,902
Yeah.

436
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,459
I thought it would feel good.

437
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:28,753
But it just hurts.

438
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:30,172
Oh, honey.

439
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,684
I think I'm ready.

440
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:49,149
Okay.

441
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,318
Good.

442
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:55,947
I'll go back to the room...

443
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:57,241
and talk to Amy.

444
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,869
Maybe she'll have some sedation option.

445
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:06,959
Mom...

446
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:18,679
I know.

447
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,474
I already know.

448
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,231
Anything you could say to me,

449
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:32,526
I already know.

450
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:14,985
My body did a really good job.

451
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,528
Oh...

452
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,280
It did so good.

453
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:37,424
Okay, I have the first dose here for you.

454
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:41,552
Gonna ease your pain. It's gonna make
your breathing so much easier.

455
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,436
Know what?

456
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:51,939
Honestly,

457
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,901
it's not that fucking serious.

458
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:02,199
Let's get this show on the road.

459
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:04,910
I'm kind of excited.

460
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:10,082
You know how many plans and trips...

461
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:13,794
I've had to cancel
because I wasn't feeling well?

462
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:22,386
And now it's like I get to go on a trip
that's just for me.

463
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,807
- Yeah.
-  Okay.

464
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:06,513
I am so proud of you.

465
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:09,266
And I love you.

466
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:14,104
And I am so grateful for you.

467
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:24,531
You are my favorite person
in the whole wide world.

468
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:39,523
I'm here.

469
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:41,608
I'm here and I got you.

470
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:23,733
Oh, shit.

471
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,801
Thank you for not biting me.

472
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:09,321
Our revels now are ended.

473
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:13,449
These are actors,

474
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:17,203
As I foretold you, were all spirits

475
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:19,998
And melted in the air, into thin air:

476
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:23,835
And, like the baseless fabric
of this vision,

477
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:28,965
The cloud-capp'd towers,
the gorgeous palaces,

478
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:33,887
The solemn temples,
the great globe itself,

479
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,263
Shall dissolve

480
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:40,226
And, like this insubstantial
pageant faded,

481
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:42,312
Leave not a rack behind.

482
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:47,816
We are such stuff
As dreams are made of, and our little life

483
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:49,611
Is rounded with a sleep.

484
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,205
No!

485
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:02,999
You're terrible. I can't...

486
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,918
Tell me...

487
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:09,838
Hey.

488
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,132
Sorry we're late.

489
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:15,135
Hi, Winter. How's school?

490
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:21,851
Well, I woke up
This morning without you

491
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:26,690
Don't ask me how, but I got through

492
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:32,362
The floor of this room
I've been pacing

493
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:36,700
Trying to drown out
The sound my heart is making

494
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:40,787
It's calling for you

495
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:48,461
Well, I woke up
This morning without you

496
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:53,466
Don't ask me how, but I got through

497
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:58,722
The floor of this room, I was pacing

498
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:03,976
Trying to drown out
The sound my heart was making

499
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:08,064
It was calling for you

500
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:18,073
Calling for you

501
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:23,246
Oh, oh, oh
