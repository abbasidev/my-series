1
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:10,427
I thought you were gonna get that job.

2
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:13,637
Well, I did too, Ruth. I did too.

3
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:17,350
But... everything happens
for a reason, you know?

4
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:19,727
- Let's give him a shot.
- Hm.

5
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:23,981
If you see a stranger sitting next to you,
I ask you to turn to them.

6
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:26,734
Maybe it would expand
our connection with them.

7
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:28,403
When we don't feel fear,

8
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:30,864
when we don't feel judgment,

9
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:33,198
we simply feel love.

10
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:34,491
<i>Like an angel through...</i>

11
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:36,202
And that is pretty amazing.

12
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:38,912
<i>I don't wanna call it off</i>

13
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:41,123
<i>But you don't wanna call it love</i>

14
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:45,169
<i>You only wanna be the one
that I call "baby"</i>

15
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,672
<i>You can kiss a hundred boys in bars...</i>

16
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:51,925
I honestly never really
thought about life like this.

17
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:56,972
What that new rabbi said about
forgiveness was wonderful, you know?

18
00:00:56,973 --> 00:01:01,644
And I looked at Lila Nover
in such a new light.

19
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,856
Maybe she isn't a bitch after all.

20
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:10,028
- I'm glad you found the sermon moving.
- Ah, it was more than that. Hm.

21
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:12,655
It was transcendent.

22
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,698
I can take it from here.

23
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:16,868
Oh yeah? Okay.

24
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:18,452
Noah.

25
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:19,662
- Hi.
- My darling.

26
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,415
All I can say is
I was not very impressed with that man.

27
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,418
And as far as I'm concerned, he is a thief

28
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,837
because he stole the job
that belongs to you.

29
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:31,507
And that sermon, it, like, spoke to me.

30
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,008
At least wait till I'm gone.

31
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,134
- Lenny.
- Hi.

32
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:37,387
No, no, no. I mean, like... You know,
it's easy for things to speak to me.

33
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:39,306
- Doesn't make it special.
- I was kidding.

34
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:40,974
It was great. I was there.

35
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:43,561
- See you at the game tomorrow.
- Darling.

36
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:48,482
Why did you write on the family chat
that you're not coming to <i>Shabbat?</i>

37
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,026
'Cause I'm not coming.

38
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,693
Is that a joke?

39
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:54,404
- I don't understand your sense of humor.
- It's not a joke, Mom.

40
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:56,657
You've made it very clear
that Joanne isn't invited,

41
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,450
so I will be spending <i>Shabbat</i> with her.

42
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:02,413
That's ridiculous.<i>Shabbat</i> is for family.

43
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,708
Bina Ylena Roklov.

44
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,461
Is your facialist family?

45
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,337
Bonnie came one time.

46
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:11,338
- Yeah.
- One time.

47
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:14,466
Listen, Joanne is my girlfriend,
whom I love.

48
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,344
If she's not there, I'm not there.

49
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:20,848
I would've welcomed her with open arms
if she had not cost my son his career.

50
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,392
Oh, you liked her before?

51
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,769
- Yes.
- Oh.

52
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,022
But after the most recent events,

53
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:31,441
I cannot even fathom
being in the same room with her.

54
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:34,112
Okay. Thank you for not piling on.

55
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,197
I can always count on you.

56
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:42,911
Oh God, I'm telling you.

57
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:45,289
Give me this guy's full name
and birth date,

58
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,249
and I'll find something
good enough to ruin him.

59
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,167
- No.
- Yeah.

60
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:51,086
Morgan, I know that comes from
a good place. Thank you, but just no.

61
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:52,671
If we can't investigate him,

62
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:56,592
and we can't go to his sermons
and boo him, what can we do?

63
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:57,719
Just change the subject.

64
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:00,762
- Okay.
- Why is he...

65
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:02,222
- So, Morgan...
- Mmm.

66
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:05,851
You're coming to the basketball game
because it's... "fun."

67
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,519
- Yes.
- Seems off.

68
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,355
Why is that so hard to believe?
I mean, you love basketball.

69
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,481
God, you're so cynical.

70
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:13,984
You should have used
a more believable excuse, Morgan,

71
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,236
like court-mandated community service.

72
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:17,571
Yeah. So what's the scheme?

73
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:20,033
I can appreciate a scheme.
What's the scheme?

74
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,535
So my therapist says
that every time I go on a date,

75
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,746
it's just a way of collecting data. Right?

76
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,623
So I went on a date with Lenny.

77
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,625
He wasn't into me, which is, like, insane.

78
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,711
No, that wasn't a date.
That was a setup in a group setting.

79
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:36,131
I am bummed you guys didn't hit it off.
Not good for my matchmaking résumé.

80
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:39,384
I'm gonna use Lenny
to collect data on me, okay?

81
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:42,096
So I'm gonna ask him
why he didn't like me.

82
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,306
Has he ever given you a gay vibe?

83
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,725
No, not at all, sorry.
Well... Doesn't matter.

84
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,186
- Terrible idea.
- A little one?

85
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,148
- Watch where you're going!
- Oh my God! What an asshole.

86
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:54,858
Oh my God, he could have killed them.

87
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:57,194
You know what?
We should go find him, okay?

88
00:03:57,195 --> 00:04:00,572
- People need to know how awful they are.
- Oh, no, no, no. They know.

89
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,074
- No, Noah, they don't.
- Yeah.

90
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,284
Somebody needs to tell them.
It's our civic duty.

91
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:06,286
I mean, I consider it a higher calling.

92
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:09,624
Listen, sometimes something happens,
and you have to just observe it,

93
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:12,335
and then you accept it,
and you try and move on.

94
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:15,254
I'm sorry, that seems way less fun.

95
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,048
Yeah. Life is for the living.

96
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,425
Moving on. Come on.

97
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:24,055
God, he's such a rabbi sometimes. Yuck.

98
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:27,933
<i>New girl thinks
That you might be the one</i>

99
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,060
Okay.

100
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,979
You wanna invite people over
for <i>Shabbat</i> this week?

101
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,355
- Sure.
- Great.

102
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,358
You didn't go to your parents' last night.

103
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:37,567
You don't think
we should make an appearance?

104
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:39,696
Eh, I don't think now's the perfect time.

105
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,240
- Ah.
- Looks beautiful.

106
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,494
Your mom can't be taking
the job thing very well.

107
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:50,330
She isn't. You know,
you'd think it was happening to her.

108
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:52,750
Let me guess. She blames me?

109
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,712
Doesn't matter.

110
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:59,339
- I think I need to talk to her directly.
- Ah, no. No, no, no.

111
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,509
Listen, in this case, I think
a conversation would make things worse.

112
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,554
Just promise me you won't talk to her.

113
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:06,096
Okay.

114
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,764
- I gotta say...
- Thank you.

115
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,224
Farmers markets are annoying.

116
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:11,435
All this small talk
about how good the fruit is.

117
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,604
We're not farmers market people.
We're DoorDash people.

118
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,526
Do you have any butter? This is quite dry.

119
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,822
- Hey.
- Hi.

120
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,240
You look hot, by the way.

121
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:27,076
Thank you.

122
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,955
- Oh my God.
- What?

123
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,749
Oh my God.

124
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,667
What?

125
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,627
You are horny right now.

126
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:38,795
- No.
- No?

127
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,505
- Truly not.
- You are.

128
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,507
I can feel it. What are you at right now?

129
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,093
I'm, like, at, like,
I wanna say, like, a zero?

130
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:47,804
You were an eight at Noah's
the other night. Wanna put on some music?

131
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:51,641
- Some soft, slow jazz?
- Oh! Now I'm at a negative four.

132
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:52,768
A negative four.

133
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,978
Yeah, it was the smooth...
It was the smooth jazz.

134
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,522
Wow, that's a big drop.

135
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:58,149
Okay.

136
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,235
I'll just have to come back later.

137
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,695
I don't know what to do with turnips.

138
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:04,946
What do you do?

139
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:06,615
- Oh, perfect.
- Mm.

140
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,992
- That asshole even took up two spots.
- Oh God.

141
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:11,620
- He's not gonna get away with this.
- Do your thing.

142
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,206
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey, what are you doing?

143
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:17,794
Ouch.

144
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:20,170
- What did you just do?
- Justice.

145
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:22,714
- Street justice.
- Street justice? That's not a...

146
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:25,842
- What? That's not a thing.
- Yes, it is. You just witnessed it.

147
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:27,678
Have you ever done anything like that?

148
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:33,059
- I... We need to get out of here.
- Street justice in Brentwood.

149
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:43,236
I feel like you're judging me.
Don't say you're not.

150
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,864
- I am judging you.
- Mm. Okay.

151
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,786
Okay. Wait, ladies.

152
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:54,454
Come to the tree.

153
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:56,541
Mm. Mm, no, can't. Sorry.

154
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,089
What's happening? This is weird.

155
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,674
This is what we do before a game.

156
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,968
We take whatever's bothering us
or preoccupying us,

157
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,804
and we leave it at the tree.

158
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,184
- I just left my judginess at the tree.
- That works fast.

159
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,145
Would you like to leave anything?

160
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:21,648
I don't believe in suppressing things.
I believe in expressing them.

161
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,817
It's not suppressing. It's transferring.

162
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,528
It is also really healthy
to confront things head-on. You know?

163
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:29,114
Like, why don't you use
your anger and frustration?

164
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,031
Okay. Fine.

165
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:33,869
Look, I was letting you in on a tradition
that has won us many championships,

166
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,540
but, you know, feel free not to use it.
Just don't tell me how I have to use it.

167
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,917
Okay, I will touch the tree.

168
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:43,003
- I'll see if anything transfers, okay?
- Yes.

169
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,797
That's gonna make you happy.

170
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,010
Tree just gave me an idea.

171
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,888
- Tree doesn't do that.
- It just did.

172
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,849
I won't confront your mom,
but at least let me write her an email.

173
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,852
- I famously write great emails.
- Okay.

174
00:07:58,853 --> 00:07:59,979
If I can vet it.

175
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,398
If you wanna waste your time.

176
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,150
- Okay, I just have to fix this.
- Mm.

177
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,986
- Okay, let me think.
- I love it when you get into email mode.

178
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,906
- Please don't talk.
- Right, yeah. Sorry. You need laser focus.

179
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:11,949
Mm.

180
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:16,328
- It's not coming.
- Yeah, because you're really relaxed.

181
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,705
Your best work always happens
when you're really angry.

182
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:20,749
I just tried to explain that to Noah.

183
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,502
Mm. God, I still quote that email
you sent Rachel Cook.

184
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,714
"The truth is, Rachel,
he's never mentioned you at all."

185
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,132
- Chills.
- Hm.

186
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,592
I think it ruined her life.

187
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,094
- That email deserves to be in a museum.
- Mm.

188
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:34,514
Okay, what about this?

189
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,848
"Hey, Bina, it's Joanne."

190
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:40,185
"It has come to my attention
that you hold some opinions about..."

191
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:43,438
- It's a terrible email.
- Oh my God. How does she hear everything?

192
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:46,192
Your approach is all wrong.
That's what it is.

193
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,443
You need to treat her like a mob boss.

194
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:51,489
You gotta shower her with compliments,
pay her the utmost respect.

195
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:56,618
- I don't know if I can do compliments.
- Let me take a crack at it. I speak Bina.

196
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,370
Okay, God.

197
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,497
- She is not your biggest fan right now.
- Yeah.

198
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,082
I thought it couldn't get worse.

199
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,127
- That's what's crazy. It did get worse.
- Can you just write the email?

200
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,546
Oh shit.

201
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:08,881
<i>Oh, shit, oh, shit</i>

202
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,343
<i>- Oh shit, oh shit
- Are you ready for this?</i>

203
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,137
<i>It's me, Fergie...</i>

204
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:19,140
- What is she doing here?
- I don't know, but it can't be good.

205
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:22,352
<i>Polow!
Fergie Ferg, what's up, baby?</i>

206
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,687
<i>- Come on
- When I come...</i>

207
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,313
- Hi.
- I know that march.

208
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:26,606
She's here for you.

209
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:29,317
- How do you know?
- Instinct. I don't want any part of it.

210
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,443
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, Sash.

211
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:31,362
Hi!

212
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,863
What is going on?

213
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:37,701
My darling, I just wanted to spend time
with my sonny-son.

214
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:38,910
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

215
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,162
- At basketball?
- I'll take what I can get.

216
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:45,585
You're not coming to my house,
so I'm coming to you, wherever you are.

217
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:47,335
Is that a curse?

218
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:50,213
No, of course not!

219
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:51,424
Sounds like one.

220
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,302
Have a good game.

221
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,062
Okay.

222
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,899
- I don't think she saw us.
- She definitely saw us.

223
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,776
But you didn't actually see her see us.

224
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,529
- Yeah, how do you know?
- She sees everything. She saw us.

225
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,157
Okay, whatever you do,
do not look over at her.

226
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,617
- Morgan!
- Morgan.

227
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,661
What? It's your fault.
You knew if you said it, I would do it.

228
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:22,955
What's she doing now?

229
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:26,708
- Ooh. Oh no, no. She's coming.
- No. Here she is.

230
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,710
- Hello, girls.
- Hi!

231
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:29,919
You enjoying the game?

232
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,046
- Yes.
- Yeah.

233
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,381
Joanne, may I have
a word with you, please?

234
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,800
- Me?
- Yeah, yeah. We need to catch up.

235
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:36,926
Hm.

236
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,094
- Yeah.
- Bye, Joanne.

237
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,095
- Come.
- Have fun.

238
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:40,306
Better you than me.

239
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:47,354
- Call the police.
- I can't. My phone's dead.

240
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,106
Mine's working. I'm not gonna call.

241
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:51,900
Hello, Joanne.

242
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,401
Hello, Bina.

243
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:57,614
As it happens, I was just writing
an email to you, if I may.

244
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:01,660
"Dearest Bina,
I know you are a very strong woman,

245
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,578
and I admire that about you."

246
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,830
"Noah has told me
of your struggles and triumphs..."

247
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,916
Stop, please. I don't want to be read to.

248
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,959
I'm... I'm not some five-year-old.

249
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,422
Okay. Well, I was gonna start
with something more cutting, anyway.

250
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:16,050
Let me get right to the point.

251
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,010
Because of you, my son's career is ruined.

252
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,845
Okay, we're getting right into it.

253
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:24,391
Because of you,
he now refuses to come to <i>Shabbat</i> dinner.

254
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:27,727
I never told him
he couldn't go to <i>Shabbat</i> dinner.

255
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:31,648
Well, apparently he won't go anywhere
where you are not included.

256
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:34,943
So you're admitting it,
that you're not "including" me.

257
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,737
I admit that you have cocooned my son
away from his family,

258
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:40,031
and you have done a number on him.

259
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,158
I may not be
what you envisioned for Noah...

260
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,451
Oh!

261
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:47,080
But mothers have been hating their son's
girlfriends since the beginning of time.

262
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:50,500
They usually keep it to themselves
or complain about it to their husbands.

263
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:53,963
So if something is getting in between
you and Noah, it's not me, it's you.

264
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:57,591
Me?

265
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,929
You can go back to your bleacher now.

266
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,057
Yeah, I know I can go back to my bleacher.

267
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,183
<i>Juice, juice</i>

268
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:08,143
<i>You got it</i>

269
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,979
<i>Yeah, uh, you got the
You got the juice</i>

270
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,064
<i>Let it rain on me like, ooh</i>

271
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,150
<i>Baby gonna ride it like a cruise</i>

272
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,153
<i>See you shine bright, no jewels...</i>

273
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:19,571
It's all right.

274
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,906
<i>I been underground making moves...</i>

275
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,825
- Hey, loser.
- Oh, what's up, loser?

276
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,326
Is that a pet name? An inside joke?

277
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:28,538
I never agreed to him calling me a loser,
so you guys figure it out yourselves.

278
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:31,040
- I could call you a loser if you wanted.
- Mm, nope.

279
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,542
But that'd be weird, you loser.

280
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:35,671
Yeah, it doesn't work for me.
It's really more your guys' thing.

281
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,300
It's just the fact
that there ever even was a thing.

282
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,051
It makes me sad.

283
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,387
Hey, let's get out of here.

284
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:47,098
- It's the middle of the game.
- The game's not important.

285
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:50,268
- I wanna take you somewhere.
- Because you're 18 points behind?

286
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,812
No, no, don't look over there.
Just come with me.

287
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,481
Sorry, what do you want from me?

288
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:57,109
I'm just asking you
a simple question, okay?

289
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,445
Why didn't you want my phone number?

290
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:03,948
- Uh, I've just been busy with work lately.
- What?

291
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,993
I mean...

292
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,287
And there's this ex
I've been texting with.

293
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,539
Oh my God,
will you just tell me the truth?

294
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:16,754
I'm asking you to, like, level with me.
Feedback is a gift, so lay it on.

295
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,925
Okay. I mean, you're obviously hot.

296
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,301
Thank you, I know.

297
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,261
- And I can tell you can be funny.
- Yeah.

298
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:28,181
I mean, not my sense of humor,
but I can tell girls really like it.

299
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,098
Cool.

300
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,392
It's just, um,

301
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:32,812
you're a little

302
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,271
severe?

303
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:37,149
"Severe"?

304
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:40,401
Okay. Okay, maybe I am.
So is that such a bad thing?

305
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:42,863
I mean, that's just, like, you know, edgy.

306
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:46,491
Yeah. Look, you're probably
one of those people who says

307
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,701
they wanna be in a relationship
when really they don't,

308
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:52,080
and, you know, to be with someone,
you have to make space for them,

309
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,166
and some people
don't have the ability to do that.

310
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,877
You got all this from one conversation
at a dinner party?

311
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:01,507
You didn't ask me one question.
Not even, like, what my name was.

312
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,552
Yeah, well, names are very personal, so...

313
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:08,471
Yeah, no, totally. I just, like,
I think you're really nice.

314
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:10,723
- It's just not my vibe.
- Okay.

315
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:11,892
I kind of, like...

316
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:15,145
I wanna be with, like, a real person.

317
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:17,606
Uh, okay.

318
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:21,151
Yeah, that's... enough. Thank you.

319
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,903
- Never seen anything like it.
- What did I do?

320
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:28,200
You are boycotting <i>Shabbat</i> dinner
because of me,

321
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:31,661
but you didn't even tell me
so that I could give you the credit.

322
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,914
I honestly thought
it would make everything worse.

323
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,668
Did you make any progress
with that conversation?

324
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:41,213
I'm gonna be honest with you. I did not.

325
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,382
Okay.

326
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,094
Well...

327
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,429
I just want you to get along.

328
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,141
In my perfect world,
we're all at <i>Shabbat</i> together.

329
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,144
Me too.

330
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,067
Sorry, I smell so good.

331
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,575
Oh, uh, shoot.

332
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,078
I saw you.

333
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,873
Yeah, I know that you saw me. I just...

334
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,250
So you can come out.

335
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,172
Okay.

336
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,008
You're not going to wash your hands?

337
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:29,970
Yeah, yeah, I was literally about to.
Okay, God.

338
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:34,974
I can see you're upset.

339
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,810
No, I'm not upset, okay? I just

340
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,979
had something in my eye, so...

341
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,982
- I can tell that you're upset.
- I'm not upset.

342
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,444
I am not upset.

343
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:49,572
Okay, I was upset.

344
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:50,908
What happened?

345
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:56,372
Wait. Sorry, why are you being
so nice to me? It's, like, scary.

346
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:57,915
Look.

347
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:03,628
I'm having a bad day.
So it's made me very open-hearted.

348
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,256
- Hm.
- Go figure. What happened?

349
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:11,929
It's... I don't know.
Just something some guy said. It's...

350
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,599
You know, Morgan, I don't like you.

351
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,142
But I respect you.

352
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,436
I'm sorry. Y-You respect me?

353
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:21,896
Yes. Well, a little.

354
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:24,774
I admire that you don't give a shit
about what other people think.

355
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:28,237
- Mm.
- Me, I care what people think.

356
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:33,074
Okay, well, don't tell Joanne this,
but I think you're very chic.

357
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,451
Thank you. I am.

358
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,953
Now, if you were hurt
by what that person said,

359
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:41,250
I doubt it is because
they think these things are true.

360
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:45,045
It is because
you think these things are true.

361
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,175
Wow, Bina, chills.

362
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:51,844
Thank you.

363
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,931
You know...

364
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:01,228
Joanne tried to end it with Noah
so that he could get that job.

365
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:02,562
What?

366
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:05,815
But he ran after her in
a very dramatic way and wouldn't let her,

367
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,693
so it's not her fault.

368
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,782
Listen, um, if I'm being,
like, really honest,

369
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,702
I would love to have what they have.

370
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,121
So...

371
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,373
God, you're so easy to open up to.

372
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,917
- Can I borrow your lip liner?
- No.

373
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,586
- That's fair.
- Yeah.

374
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,839
Well, that's that. See ya.

375
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,180
Okay, good call.

376
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:39,766
Yeah. Remember how much time
we used to spend here?

377
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,350
Yeah, I do.

378
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:45,647
Hey, uh, guys, do me a favor
and just give us some space here.

379
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:48,608
Just this table has, like,
sentimental value for us.

380
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:52,487
- We came here before we were together.
- We don't need to explain. Just beat it.

381
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,156
- All right.
- Please?

382
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,741
Honey, they're 15.

383
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,159
We were here first, loser.

384
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,578
You're a loser.

385
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:04,291
- Okay, you're fighting with a teenager.
- Yeah, that guy's immature.

386
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,004
- Hey, you want a gummy?
- More than anything.

387
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:14,050
They're not the kind that make you sleepy.
These ones make you happy.

388
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,052
Happy ones?

389
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,264
Marriage is hard.

390
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:20,599
Yeah.

391
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,767
So you like her now?

392
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,187
Yeah. I can't lie, I really do.

393
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:28,524
I have never hated you more
than I do in this moment.

394
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,691
What do you like about her?

395
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:34,862
I don't know. She's just so small
and, like, wise. Like, I don't know.

396
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,489
She actually seems really nice, so...

397
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:40,035
She and I just connect. You know?

398
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,912
- Oh, but guess what?
- What, Morgan?

399
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,040
I told her that you walked away from Noah.

400
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,584
So she knows now.

401
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,671
- Oh my God.
- Mm.

402
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,465
I get to be the bigger person
<i>and</i> win the fight

403
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,008
because she had bad info on me?

404
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,051
You're welcome.

405
00:18:57,052 --> 00:19:00,556
Oh wow. That makes me feel so alive.

406
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:06,060
I actually kind of feel like
I could extend an olive branch now.

407
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,521
Come on, come on, come on!

408
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,148
- Speed it up, speed it up!
- Oh.

409
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,150
No, no, no. Don't pick it up. Let's go.

410
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,109
Noah!

411
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:16,487
<i>Pushing me towards my limitations...</i>

412
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,780
Okay.

413
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:20,116
<i>And honestly, too much for me</i>

414
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:23,494
<i>This ain't real love
And I'm crying out of disbelief</i>

415
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:26,706
<i>I can't believe
You're out of your mind</i>

416
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,791
<i>All the things you say...</i>

417
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,252
Time-out! I need a time-out.

418
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,420
- Where are you going?
- Be back!

419
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,714
<i>I don't even know what to...</i>

420
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,174
Number eight. Get in.

421
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,342
<i>When you act out this way</i>

422
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:39,302
<i>You're in a...</i>

423
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:42,763
- Where are you taking me?
- Have a bit of trust in me, okay?

424
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:43,849
Oh, hey.

425
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,477
- Noah.
- Hey.

426
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:49,479
Hey, gang.

427
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:53,441
- What's going on?
- I don't know. This woman is so erratic.

428
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,985
Now that some pertinent information
has come to light

429
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:59,030
that exonerates me, uh,
I'm ready to move on,

430
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:03,326
and I thought we could do
the ancient and beautiful Jewish tradition

431
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,119
of leaving it at the tree.

432
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,414
- So, Bina, if you wanna...
- What is she talking about?

433
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:12,836
Jo, it's not a Jewish thing.
It's just a team tradition.

434
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,171
Shaq did it.

435
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:16,632
Hm.

436
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:22,054
Okay. Well, I mean,
it doesn't work anyway, so...

437
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:23,596
Yes, it does.

438
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:24,722
- Does it?
- Yes.

439
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:27,893
For a guy who left it all at the tree,
you are not playing very well.

440
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:32,104
Well, the tree's not perfect. Sometimes
you still have stuff on your mind.

441
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:33,397
Yeah, so let it out.

442
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:34,399
No.

443
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,026
I don't need to.

444
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:37,819
You sure?

445
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,196
Is it about Big Noah?

446
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,113
No.

447
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:42,031
- No?
- Nope.

448
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,325
- Sure?
- Yeah.

449
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,118
He's perfectly fine.

450
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:46,954
Hm.

451
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,581
It's not 'cause they call him Big Noah?
'Cause that would...

452
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:54,210
Okay, okay, fine! Yes. Yes.

453
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,380
I hate Big Noah, okay?

454
00:20:56,922 --> 00:21:02,177
I fucking hate
that they call him Big Noah. What?

455
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:06,347
And I really hate
that his sermon was not only good...

456
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,683
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

457
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:09,977
But it stayed with me.

458
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,480
And I hate how jealous I've become.

459
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,440
You know, I worked

460
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,776
my entire life for that job,

461
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:22,030
and the fact that it's now his,
it literally makes me sick.

462
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,868
Oh, I'm sorry you had to hear that.

463
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,582
I'm so glad
you finally said that out loud.

464
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,334
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

465
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:37,879
Am I a bad person?

466
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:40,090
No.

467
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:41,925
You're just a person.

468
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:44,177
Yeah?

469
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,263
Okay, I give up.

470
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,309
Joanne, why don't you
come to <i>Shabbat</i> dinner?

471
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:51,810
Really?

472
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:55,397
Yes. And now I'm going
before I change my mind.

473
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:00,861
Oh my God, it's the tree.

474
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:02,321
No, no.

475
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:04,323
That was all you.

476
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:08,409
God, it felt really good
to get all that out.

477
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,327
Didn't it?

478
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,287
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

479
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:11,830
Think anyone heard me?

480
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,919
- I actually have to...
- It was good. Yeah, go. Go get 'em.

481
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,838
I hate it when you're mad at me.

482
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,382
I'm not even mad at you.

483
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:27,595
I'm... If anything, I'm upset,
you know, about the distance between us.

484
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,138
Morgan was just a friend.

485
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:31,266
We were just friends.

486
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,769
And then we weren't.

487
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,022
You know?

488
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:42,778
We're still the same people
who fell in love at this table.

489
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:46,698
Yeah.

490
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:48,700
Hey.

491
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,577
We can do this.

492
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:52,245
I know we can.

493
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:54,164
Let's try.

494
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:58,667
It's so much easier to have hope
when that gummy's about to kick in.

495
00:22:58,668 --> 00:22:59,628
Yeah.

496
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:03,006
- Especially when you've had two.
- Okay.

497
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,094
Thank you for walking me to my car, Lenny.

498
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,222
Any time. You okay?

499
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:11,932
I'm great.

500
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:14,393
Hey, look at that.

501
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,687
Those two are really tied together, huh?

502
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:20,523
And I have scissors.

503
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:21,900
<i>Are you ready for it?</i>

504
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,737
<i>Baby, let the games begin</i>

505
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:30,658
<i>Let the games begin
Let the games begin, ah, ah</i>

506
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:34,203
<i>Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin</i>

507
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:35,496
<i>Let the games begin</i>

508
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:39,208
<i>I, I, I see how this is gonna go</i>

509
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,210
<i>Touch me and you'll never be alone</i>

510
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:44,713
<i>I-Island breeze and lights down low</i>

511
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,216
<i>No one has to know</i>

512
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:52,763
<i>In the middle of the night
In my dreams</i>

513
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,723
<i>My dreams</i>

514
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:57,226
<i>- You should see the things we do
- We do</i>

515
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:58,937
<i>- Baby
- Baby</i>

516
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:04,233
<i>In the middle of the night
In my dreams</i>

517
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:05,277
<i>My dreams</i>

518
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:08,237
<i>I know I'm gonna be with you</i>

519
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:12,117
<i>So I take my time</i>

520
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,995
<i>- In the middle of the night
- Baby, let the games begin</i>

521
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,998
<i>Let the games begin
Let the games begin</i>

522
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:22,251
<i>- Are you ready for it?
- Baby, let the games begin</i>

523
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:25,045
<i>Let the games begin
Let the games begin</i>

524
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:26,338
<i>Are you ready for it?</i>

525
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:29,758
<i>Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin</i>

526
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,094
<i>Are you ready for it?</i>
