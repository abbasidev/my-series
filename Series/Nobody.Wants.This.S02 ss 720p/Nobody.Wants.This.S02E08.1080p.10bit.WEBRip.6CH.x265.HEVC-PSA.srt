00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:17,058
<i>If I need you one last time</i>

2
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:21,062
<i>If I need you one last time</i>

3
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:24,899
<i>If I need you one last time</i>

4
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,111
<i>Can I meet you one last time?</i>

5
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:32,448
<i>Baby, I need you now for your...</i>

6
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:35,117
This is the kind of quality time
I've always dreamt about.

7
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:37,662
Wow, I forgot you were even here.

8
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:38,997
Hey.

9
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:43,000
When are you recording the podcast?
Do you need some more <i>Noah's Corner?</i>

10
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:45,127
We always need more <i>Noah's Corner.</i>

11
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:48,172
Um, I'm not sure
when we're recording this week.

12
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,089
Okay.

13
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,758
What are you guys doing here?

14
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,092
- Hey!
- No way!

15
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:53,761
- Hey!
- Gabe, how are ya?

16
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,554
- I'll join ya.
- Oh, okay.

17
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:58,223
You guys, uh, see the Warhol piece inside?

18
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,975
- No.
- No, we didn't come for the art.

19
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:02,519
We came because they have a good gift shop
and excellent chai.

20
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,520
- Mm.
- Yeah.

21
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:04,438
So no art at all?

22
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,023
No, I promised her we wouldn't.

23
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,941
My body shuts down inside museums.

24
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:10,861
I stand in front of a piece of art,
and I feel compelled to say

25
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:14,073
I see something I don't actually see.
I can't be myself in front of art.

26
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,241
Yeah, I get that. How's it going at Ahava?

27
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,911
- Was I right about that place or what?
- Oh.

28
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,913
- Right?
- So right. So right.

29
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,457
It's great. You know, Neil and Cami.

30
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,710
- Mm.
- They got very cool ideas.

31
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,337
Um, how are you? How's the fam?

32
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,672
Oh man. Um...

33
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:32,049
Yeah, Abby and I are done.

34
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,342
- Whoa!
- So...

35
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,677
- Oh my God. I can't believe it.
- Yeah.

36
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:37,931
- You guys seemed so happy.
- Yeah, but it was fake.

37
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:40,224
Instagram is fake.

38
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,017
Life is a wild journey, man.

39
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:43,519
You do seem lighter.

40
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,855
Thank you. Yeah. We both are.
We both are. I think it's for the best.

41
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:50,526
Listen, I've counseled a lot of couples
going through some tough times.

42
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,778
I'm your rabbi now.
I'd love to talk with you.

43
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,948
Hopefully, there's possible solutions
that don't involve separation.

44
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:59,451
Obviously, it's not just you and Abby now.
There's Afternoon. There's Jesse Charles.

45
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,662
Why don't you come by my office tomorrow?

46
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,705
I don't know.

47
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,916
It would be an honor.
Whatever comes of it.

48
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,751
- Okay, let's do it. Great.
- Okay, good.

49
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,962
- I look forward to it. See you then.
- I love it.

50
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,381
- Text me, let me know when.
- Okay. Love you guys.

51
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,298
Love you too.

52
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,299
Hm.

53
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,385
Oh man.

54
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,262
I wonder who I can set Abby up with.

55
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,221
Joanne.

56
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,264
What?

57
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,765
Any marriage ending is sad.

58
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:22,766
I don't agree.

59
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:26,603
I think you have one life to live,
and sometimes, the person you marry

60
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:29,898
isn't the person
you end up being married to.

61
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:30,899
Did that make sense?

62
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,694
Not really, but I've seen a lot of couples
that are ready to give up,

63
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:36,363
and they found a way
to fall back in love. It happens.

64
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:39,366
I'm sure that that happens,
but I think there's also couples

65
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:42,327
who stay together way too long,
and that makes it worse.

66
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,787
Especially on the kids.

67
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:46,290
No. Obviously,
your parents' situation is different.

68
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,250
Is that the only way it can be different?

69
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:51,170
Like, can you only get divorced
if one of them is secretly gay?

70
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:54,006
- Yeah. 100%. Listen.
- Where are you going?

71
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,341
You know what? I gotta go.
I'm meeting Batya soon.

72
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,509
Who's Batya?

73
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,555
That would be your mother.
She, uh, picked her Hebrew name.

74
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:04,308
Wow. Okay, well,
let me know if she shows up.

75
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,852
Because she usually gives up on stuff
right about now.

76
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:07,978
- Batya will be there.
- Okay.

77
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,522
- You good with all this stuff?
- Yeah, I'll clean all this up.

78
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:13,150
Yep, and then if you need me,
I'll be in the kitchen, okay?

79
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,234
I know you will.

80
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:15,360
All right, bye.

81
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:18,281
<i>Who's your boyfriend now?</i>

82
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:24,912
So, number one, I wanted to start
a relationship with your synagogue

83
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,789
as it seems the right fit.

84
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,958
Does she know we know each other,
or is that illegal?

85
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,210
Yep, it's legal.

86
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,754
Okay, then. And, uh, number two,

87
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:37,716
I wanted to do conversion classes here
because I love Noah.

88
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,636
Both on the inside and out.
And looks are very important to me.

89
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:41,720
Me too.

90
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,138
Same page.

91
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:44,598
- He's gorgeous.
- Okay, well, listen.

92
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,767
Typical conversion takes about a year.

93
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,645
Unless, I don't know,
unless Ahava has a different protocol.

94
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,897
We have the half year,
the "loose conversion,"

95
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:55,734
and we have the full year, which we call
the "conversion no one's ever asked for."

96
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,486
Six months doesn't seem like enough.

97
00:03:57,487 --> 00:04:00,864
I'm very loose,
so I would love the loose conversion.

98
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,950
You're not even gonna feel it.
It's painless.

99
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:05,536
- It'll be over before you know it.
- Is it cheaper?

100
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,287
- Oh.
- No, it's...

101
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:10,249
We don't charge anyone to become a Jew.
We see it as a blessing.

102
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,168
Oh, well, I've already been studying
Judaism on my own.

103
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:16,964
I stay up all night reading about it.
I mean, do you wanna test me?

104
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,216
- Ask me anything Jewish.
- We don't have to test you.

105
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,009
- No, I wanna test her.
- Oh, okay.

106
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:25,180
Um, okay, what are two objects
that are waved around during Sukkot?

107
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,098
Oh, that's hard.

108
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,476
- Well, she wants to be...
<i>- Lulav</i> and <i>etrog.</i>

109
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:30,727
Wow.

110
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:33,021
All right.
What's the name of Moses's wife?

111
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:36,692
Zipporah, also known as Sephora,

112
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,444
later to be used
by an esteemed beauty supply chain.

113
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:43,115
I love you. I respect you.
This is amazing. I love you.

114
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,658
Honestly, you can't stump me.

115
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,951
I'm a speed reader,

116
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:49,579
and I also know what happened
on every single day of my life.

117
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,081
Just like Marilu Henner.

118
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:54,501
Uh, listen, Lynn,
you seem to really love Jewish learning,

119
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:57,504
so I really think the year-long course
is right for you because...

120
00:04:57,505 --> 00:05:00,924
- No chance.
- She's a six-month girl.

121
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,802
Well, thank you
for a perfectly gorgeous lunch date.

122
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:07,723
Aw. And thank you for teaching me
how to pronounce "salad niçois."

123
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,350
- Niçoise.
- Are you sure there's a...

124
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:12,436
- No. It's niçoise.
- I thought you said... Okay.

125
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,438
I have about 15 minutes
till my next patient.

126
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,648
- I gotta tell you about this guy.
- Mm.

127
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:20,861
Really interesting.
Extreme kleptomaniac. It's wild.

128
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,738
Isn't that supposed to be confidential?

129
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:26,241
No. Patient confidentiality is one of
the things that Freud was wrong about.

130
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,661
- He was wrong about a lot. This guy...
- Andy?

131
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,079
Andy!

132
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,206
Helena.

133
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,584
Oh my God. You look stunning.

134
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,544
- So do you.
- Look at your hair.

135
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:40,339
Your skin. Are you getting younger on me?

136
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,340
Only in spirit.

137
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,468
- Uh-huh.
- But thank you.

138
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,388
So wait, how do you know each other?

139
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,141
- She's my ex-patient.
- We dated.

140
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,060
- Oh!
- I forgot about that.

141
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,480
We did.

142
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,359
I should go. Uh, it was...
it was nice seeing you.

143
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,944
- Nice to meet you.
- I'll see you.

144
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:07,032
- Yeah, that was hilarious.
- Mm.

145
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:10,535
I mean, was it? I thought
that I was the only patient you dated.

146
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:13,873
Honestly, it wasn't even a thing.
It was like six months or something, so...

147
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,916
Oh, okay.

148
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:20,879
I mean, six months is a little long-ish
to forget, but sure, okay.

149
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,506
- Morgan, I...
- It's fine.

150
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,509
I don't even think of her
like that. It was...

151
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,806
Why do you doubt that this is real for me?

152
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,850
Because this is the three-week mark, Mom,

153
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:37,437
where you quit something you thought you
were gonna do for the rest of your life,

154
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:40,649
and I just wanna make sure
you don't feel embarrassed

155
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,567
if you're already over it, you know?

156
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,820
No, this is different. This is real.

157
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,948
I... I... I am Jewish. I am sure.

158
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,951
What the hell? Um, how...
How are you sure though?

159
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,620
I'm sure, sure, sure.

160
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:57,708
Are you asking this because
I'm converting, or because you're not?

161
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:01,462
Both. I don't know. Tell me this.

162
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,423
How do you know?

163
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:05,591
I feel it.

164
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:10,470
I've spent my whole life feeling like
everyone else had something I didn't have.

165
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:13,307
And now I feel I have it.

166
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:16,560
Oh my God. This is real.
For the first time.

167
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:19,688
This is the thing you picked
that turns out to be real. This is in...

168
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,356
This sucks.

169
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:22,774
Be happy for me.

170
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,819
I have faith, and it feels...

171
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,946
You know, it's like I was never at peace,

172
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,781
and now I feel at peace.

173
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,535
No, I'm... I'm happy that you're at peace.
I really am.

174
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:36,204
I'm just saying that it would make
my life a whole lot easier

175
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,914
if I could feel that too.

176
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:40,167
Well, everything happens when it's right.

177
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:44,504
You know, you may have to go
at your own speed, just inch by inch.

178
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:47,425
I don't think
I have time to go inch by inch.

179
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:51,636
Noah and I can't move forward
if I don't start feeling something soon.

180
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,972
And meanwhile,
Morgan's racing to the altar.

181
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,975
- You know, not a road bump in sight.
- You'll get there.

182
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,477
I have faith.

183
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,687
I know.

184
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,606
Quit bragging about it.

185
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:06,736
We should be done already.
This is taking way too long.

186
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:11,032
Oh. Hey, Fabrizio.

187
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,825
- Oh, hey.
- How's it going?

188
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,827
Just dealing with this stupid pool guy.

189
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,663
- Can I help you with this?
- Oh my God. Yeah, I'm in a rush.

190
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:22,375
Joanne left this stuff at my house, and
I... Can you leave it on her front step?

191
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:24,211
- Yeah, yeah, sure thing.
- Thank you.

192
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,754
How's the podcast going?

193
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,047
Oh, uh, great.

194
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:30,760
Yeah, Joanne actually gave you a shout-out
on the last episode. It was hilarious.

195
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,178
Oh, cool, yeah. I'll check it out.

196
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,971
Okay. Thank you.

197
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:37,057
Feels like we spent enough time
with my mom.

198
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,059
She asked if we had plans.

199
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,143
Yoo-hoo!

200
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:41,436
Hey, come in.

201
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:42,979
Shoes on or off?

202
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,856
Oh, uh, whatever you like.

203
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,733
Hey, Mom, why do I hear Dad's voice?

204
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:50,570
Uh, we spent the afternoon shopping,
and he asked what I was doing for dinner.

205
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:53,323
Me and your mom are back together.
I prayed the gay away.

206
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,742
- Oh, you should have more kids.
- We had sex all afternoon.

207
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:57,244
Oh God!

208
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:01,623
So I was out there today.
I just love the groovy vibe at Ahava.

209
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:04,125
It... It feels like
the perfect place for me.

210
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:06,420
Yes, it is a groovy vibe.

211
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,965
Noah, now be truthful.
Are you into groovy vibes?

212
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,259
- I love groovy vibes.
- Okay.

213
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,804
If it's not groovy, get it out.
It's not my vibe, you know?

214
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,431
- You guys went shopping?
- Lynn got me this sweater.

215
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:19,849
- What do you think?
- Great.

216
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,726
Isn't it wonderful? Don't you love it?

217
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,687
- When did I get man boobs?
- Just go one size up.

218
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,147
Don't put yourself down.

219
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,942
I think it's so cool you guys
have such a nice relationship.

220
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,277
Yeah, I know.

221
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:34,656
I mean, when I got divorced,
it was hell for a while. Absolute hell.

222
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:37,117
But we're a better couple now
than ever before.

223
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,952
- Yeah?
- Lynn is a saint.

224
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,453
The strongest woman I know.

225
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:42,956
- What about me?
- Like I said, the strongest woman I know.

226
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,874
And we still fight.

227
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:48,086
I mean, sometimes I wake up
in the middle of the night,

228
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:52,048
and I'm so angry at something I remembered
that happened when we were together.

229
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:55,176
And she calls me.
I mean, I let her get it all out,

230
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:58,555
and then I say I'm sorry, and then
I beg her to let me get back to sleep.

231
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,599
- Can't be good for your dating.
- No.

232
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,935
Well, Dad never dates anyone long enough
for them to care.

233
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,228
- Okay.
- You know what I mean.

234
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,272
You and Mom aren't commitment people.

235
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,566
Honey, to be fair, you're not much better.

236
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,651
You went to four different high schools.

237
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:14,571
You were a cosmetologist
and an interior designer at that time,

238
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,115
and, um, I haven't seen you
give a facial in a while.

239
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,784
- You went to four different high schools?
- Yeah.

240
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,995
Five if you count
the two days of homeschooling.

241
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:25,123
High school was hard.
I kept wanting to reinvent myself,

242
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,292
but then I was still myself
wherever I went.

243
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:30,086
And we gave her space, you know,
to find herself, you know,

244
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,547
figure out who she was.

245
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,466
I think it was a good thing.

246
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,385
I love who she turned into.

247
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,430
I think she's faking it around you.

248
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,143
Where are you going?

249
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,394
Thailand.

250
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:47,354
- What?
- Yep.

251
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:50,774
It was very last-minute. I just booked it.
I had points. I just did it.

252
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:53,486
- Hi. Who are you?
- I am someone who tries new things.

253
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,529
Did I tell you that I did surf camp?

254
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,698
No, you didn't tell me that you did...
How was that?

255
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,659
- It was really awful.
- It was bad?

256
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,870
Didn't get up on the board even once,
and I did almost drown.

257
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,288
But I tried something new.

258
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:07,248
- Ah, Beck...
- Mm-hmm.

259
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:10,126
I just... I feel like
you're in such a great place.

260
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:12,212
- Like a strange, great place...
- Mm.

261
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,755
But such a great place.

262
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,548
Thank you. I really am.

263
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:18,718
And I mean,
I really was not for a long time.

264
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,220
- Sure.
- Famously.

265
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:24,974
But I feel like I'm just so glad
that Noah broke up with me.

266
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:29,105
Like, our last conversation,
it weirdly set me free.

267
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,774
I know that sounds corny,
but it's really true.

268
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:36,236
I am so happy
that you said it sounds corny.

269
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:39,280
- Yeah. Okay.
- So I didn't have to.

270
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,908
- Good one.
- Fun! Look at the rosemary!

271
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:44,202
- Yeah, that's really pretty.
- Okay, wait, cheers!

272
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,329
Cheers!

273
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,463
What's up, loser?

274
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:57,174
Wait, you're outside?

275
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:58,758
What's wrong?

276
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,219
Oh man!

277
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,929
- I really liked Dr. Andy.
- I know.

278
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,140
- I feel so betrayed.
- Me too.

279
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,850
You guys seemed so happy.

280
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:11,479
I mean, that's what the confusing part is.
Like, Dr. Andy makes me happy.

281
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,065
Is this the kind of thing
where something like this happens,

282
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:18,069
and it makes you not trust him,
but also, like... it?

283
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,071
Yes.

284
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,948
I don't know, but he dotes on me.

285
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:26,161
Oh, yeah, no, I mean, it's crazy doting.
It's like you're his little Pekingese dog.

286
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,163
I know, then he drops these little bombs.

287
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:31,875
Like, he doesn't talk to his family,
and he can't go to Texas.

288
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:34,711
That's cool. That's like
<i>Thelma and Louise</i>. That's kinda hot.

289
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:38,882
And today was the biggest bomb of all.
Like, I feel completely thrown.

290
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,885
Like, I was living in, like,
one version of reality,

291
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,721
and now I'm in
a completely different version.

292
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:48,683
Like... Like, the Dr. Andy who loves me
and makes me feel so happy,

293
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:50,978
just, like, isn't real.

294
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,899
I always think the only way
you're really gonna know somebody

295
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,444
is if you can, like, steal their phone
and just, like, spend an hour with it.

296
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:03,532
See their Instagram algorithm.
That's gonna tell you who they are.

297
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,410
Oh my God. We actually could.
He's dead asleep.

298
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:10,121
Every time I leave,
he just shuts down like a robot.

299
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,791
It's another weird thing about him.

300
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,460
Okay, we have a plan.
Buckle your seat belt, baby.

301
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,963
Why am I... I was watching the game.

302
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:22,050
Oh God. I know it's weird,
but sometimes I forget how to have fun.

303
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:25,261
Running around telling everyone,
like, "I'm so fun."

304
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:28,640
But even I can see that a fun person
would, like, never say that.

305
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,142
- Does that make sense?
- Mm.

306
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,688
How are you and Sash doing?
Are things better, or...

307
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:38,275
I don't even know
how me and Sash are doing, to be honest.

308
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:39,984
- Right.
- Right.

309
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,736
I mean, can I?

310
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:42,904
You always can.

311
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,406
You guys got married
'cause you were pregnant.

312
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:47,742
I mean, you were so young.

313
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:49,202
- Babies.
- Babies.

314
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:53,248
Exactly. We were friends before,
and we're gonna be friends forever.

315
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,793
You know, no matter what, but

316
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,421
is Sasha who I would pick today?

317
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:01,674
Oh wow.

318
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,801
- Anyway, you were gonna show me...
- Yeah.

319
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,886
Who are you talking to on Bumble?

320
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,555
We are having a good time.

321
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,850
Okay, fine, fine, fine. Fine.

322
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:15,645
- Rebecca. He has so many tattoos!
- I know.

323
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:18,231
- And I sent him a message.
- Esther, you didn't!

324
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:22,277
We need to come up with a fake reason for
why we're trying to get into this phone.

325
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,696
- Okay. This is exciting.
- Yeah, I know.

326
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:28,075
- Okay, so my beloved aunt died.
- Okay.

327
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:29,909
Her name was...

328
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,036
Uh, Pamela Streisand.

329
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:35,206
Sounds fake. It sounds like you thought of
Barbra Streisand and Pamela Anderson

330
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,291
and put them together.

331
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,501
We're so connected.
How did you know I did that?

332
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,420
Because you're an idiot. Okay, so...

333
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,755
- Pamela McMillan...
- McMillan.

334
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:45,508
Was an acclaimed poet,

335
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:49,637
and this is her greatest book of poems.

336
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:51,973
- Okay, that's really good.
- I know.

337
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,517
Nobody can name a poet
but they don't wanna admit they can't.

338
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:55,435
Exactly.

339
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,604
Uh, Morgan? Morgan?

340
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,272
- Yes. Hi. That's me.
- Hi.

341
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,441
- Should I be British for this?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

342
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,610
Welcome. My name is Terry.
How can I help you?

343
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:04,777
Hello, Terry.

344
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,447
Hi, Terry.

345
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,197
- I can't do this.
- No. Kill it.

346
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:10,658
My aunt died. Pamela McMillan.

347
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,535
- And...
- Oh, she's a very famous poet.

348
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:17,206
Wrote mostly about, uh,
post-famine Ireland, whatever.

349
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:20,919
Yeah, of course, he knows. So, any case,
we are trying to get into her phone

350
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:27,175
so that we can retrieve her last
and perhaps greatest work. Is... Yeah.

351
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:31,931
Okay, yeah. That's not a believable story
in any way, shape, or form. So...

352
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:33,681
Really?

353
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:34,599
Yeah.

354
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,604
Okay, so, the truth is, Terry,
that my fiancé,

355
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,521
he lied about something,

356
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:44,192
and we are trying to figure out
if he's lying about other things too.

357
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:49,197
And so you want me to illegally
break into his phone and help you out?

358
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,283
Yeah. But we would

359
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:55,578
prefer that you use
a different term than illegally.

360
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,080
- Oh. Of course.
- Yeah.

361
00:15:57,081 --> 00:16:00,334
What was I thinking?
Okay, so what word should we use?

362
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,794
Ooh. Broad-mindedly?

363
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,295
- Unconventionally.
- Yeah.

364
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,631
Okay. Okay.
Maybe I can help you guys, yeah.

365
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:10,760
Okay, that was... Your tone did not sound
like you were gonna help us out at all.

366
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:13,304
As soon as that accent came out,
I was like, this won't work.

367
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,558
I'm not going to break into his phone.
Still illegal.

368
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,059
What?

369
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,520
Okay, so, uh, I'm sorry, I'm confused,

370
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:23,272
because it really sounded
like you were going to help us.

371
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:24,315
Yeah, that was...

372
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,776
If you find yourself
here at my little help desk

373
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:29,028
asking me to break
into your fiancé's phone

374
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,405
because you don't trust him,

375
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:33,909
don't you think you already have
the answer you're looking for,

376
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,245
Morgan?

377
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,747
- Wow, I got chills.
- I know.

378
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:44,002
God, Terry, you really are a genius.

379
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,129
- Steven?
- Yo!

380
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,757
- I'm seeing Gabe tomorrow.
- Hm.

381
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:50,884
He confirmed.

382
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,846
Hoping it's nothing a little
honest communication can't solve.

383
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:55,764
Ah.

384
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,849
Honest communication.

385
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,561
Communication is definitely important.

386
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,271
Okay.

387
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,399
Do you wanna be honest with me
about Ahava?

388
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,609
- What about it?
- Uh...

389
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,778
About how you hate it?

390
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,156
Oh my God. I don't hate it.

391
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,366
Well, you don't love it.

392
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:18,286
I... don't love it. No, that's true.

393
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:21,330
I definitely don't love it.
How could you tell?

394
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:22,915
Well, the groovy vibes thing.

395
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,252
- Was it the groovy vibes?
- Yeah. Yeah.

396
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:28,171
And also the way you say "Neil and Cami."

397
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,839
"Neil and Cami"? Really?

398
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,757
Do you hear that?

399
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,717
Neil and Cami.

400
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,303
Yeah, sorry. Listen,
I wasn't trying to hide it from you.

401
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:39,807
I was just... reluctant to admit it,
I think, even to myself.

402
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:42,518
It's a great place.
It's just not my place.

403
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,562
- So how about you?
- What?

404
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,273
Something's going on with you and Morgan.
She hasn't been around.

405
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:49,734
You haven't talked to her in days.

406
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:54,489
We had a really big fight,
and we're taking a break from the podcast.

407
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,199
Okay.

408
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,995
I don't think I was emotionally ready
to go wedding dress shopping.

409
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,539
- Mm.
- It made me feel like we're behind them.

410
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,166
Well, it's not a competition.

411
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,252
- We can't rush this, you know?
- I know.

412
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,504
Marriage is a very big deal.

413
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,964
It's, uh, supposed to be

414
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:12,674
forever.

415
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,927
Why did you say it like that?

416
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,681
I don't love how quickly
you want people to give up.

417
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,432
Uh...

418
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,935
Okay, with all due respect
to Gabe and Abby,

419
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,771
I'm, like, not that invested
in their future.

420
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,397
Fine, let's talk about us, then.

421
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:31,359
If we were married and things got hard,
what would you do?

422
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,361
How am I supposed to answer that?

423
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:36,989
I don't know, but I mean,
you get in a fight, the podcast is off.

424
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,826
Neither of your parents think
it's important to stick with anything.

425
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:40,993
It's scary.

426
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:44,372
Marriage seems hard, you know?
Things won't be perfect.

427
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,749
There'll be days
when I'm not your favorite person.

428
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,127
- I know.
- Days you're not your favorite person.

429
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,879
It's not like it's high school
when you can just

430
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,883
switch every year if you're not happy.

431
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,095
I mean,

432
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:00,681
I guess you can.

433
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:02,808
And that's what's so scary.

434
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,269
Okay.

435
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:09,063
I grew up in a house with two people
who never should've gotten married.

436
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:11,899
Okay? And it went on way too long,
and it was horrible.

437
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,485
The version of my parents
that you saw tonight,

438
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:17,238
I would've killed for that
when I was little.

439
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:20,366
I switched high schools

440
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:23,078
because I was trying to escape my life.

441
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:27,206
Growing up with a mom
who became someone new every year,

442
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:30,001
it was unstable,
and it made me feel anxious.

443
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:33,504
And all I want now
is normalcy and stability.

444
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,799
And I didn't think I'd ever have it.

445
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:42,431
And you think now that I have the chance,
I'm gonna run away from it?

446
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:44,766
No.

447
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,269
No, I don't.

448
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,521
Good.

449
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:53,567
'Cause you know what the dream is?

450
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,610
What's the dream?

451
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:59,113
Wanting to have sex with someone
who makes you feel safe.

452
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,407
<i>Hey, everything was...</i>

453
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,284
I didn't think that existed.

454
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,244
Mm.

455
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:06,495
Gosh, I hope you find that.

456
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:08,122
<i>And romance...</i>

457
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,498
I hope you find it too.

458
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,626
<i>When the sun comes up</i>

459
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:15,379
<i>If we could just stay</i>

460
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:20,676
<i>If we could just stay
This version of us</i>

461
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,178
- Thank you.
- All right.

462
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,639
- Here you go.
- Getting ice cream is a great idea.

463
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,059
It's a perfect thing to do when you fail
at breaking into somebody's phone.

464
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,938
Yeah. I guess.

465
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:34,607
I don't know. I guess I'll have to have
an honest conversation with him

466
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:35,608
in the morning.

467
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:38,486
Nothing worse than an honest conversation.

468
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,488
I guess.
I already know what he's gonna do.

469
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,532
He's just gonna turn it around,
and he's gonna, like,

470
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:48,079
I don't know, say that I'm all fucked-up
because of my fucked-up family.

471
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,832
That's not fair.
Everybody's got a fucked-up family.

472
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,252
- My family's quietly fucked-up.
- Mm.

473
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:57,922
Everybody thinks my mom is so direct,
and she says what she means,

474
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,967
but she says what she wants.

475
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:03,552
And that's...
It's, like, a little different.

476
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:05,681
- I gotta say, I love Bina.
- Oh.

477
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,515
She loves you too.

478
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:08,975
That's why I like her.

479
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:11,227
I'm just kidding.

480
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,230
And you and Esther seem great.

481
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:15,941
Yeah, we're... I mean, we're...

482
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,610
Yeah, no, we're good.

483
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:21,488
Sasha.

484
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:26,200
Wait, what's going on? You were just
staring out into the distance.

485
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,202
I...

486
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:31,999
She's just...
She's been, like, really distant lately.

487
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,085
Kind of feels like I'm losing her,
you know?

488
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:37,628
And it's kind of killing me.

489
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:38,880
I'm sorry.

490
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,882
You wanna talk about it?

491
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:42,925
I gotta tell you,

492
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:45,846
the last thing that I wanna do
is have an honest conversation.

493
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:52,686
I really liked the last episode
of your podcast, by the way. The, uh...

494
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:56,939
The bit about Joanne and the landlord
was really funny.

495
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,276
- Oh.
- I hope he doesn't listen.

496
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:01,445
Shit.

497
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:05,197
Oh my God. I totally forgot
what we said about him.

498
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:07,783
I just remembered
we gave Fabrizio a shout-out. Shit.

499
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:09,535
His name's Fabrizio?

500
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,121
I'm so screwed.

501
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,916
Can I guess what you're gonna say?

502
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:17,001
- Yeah.
- Okay.

503
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:20,297
You're gonna say, um,
marriage should be forever.

504
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:24,300
And, uh, there are ebbs and flows.

505
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:27,428
And you need to find a way
to weather the storm.

506
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,889
Uh, truthfully, yes.

507
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,351
- I was gonna say something like that, but...
- See?

508
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:36,187
I'm starting to wonder if every couple
doesn't have to find their own path.

509
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,358
You know, sometimes families
can only come together

510
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:41,360
once they've come apart.

511
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:44,528
So why don't you tell me
about you and Abby?

512
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:47,239
I have a lot of thoughts.
I'd love to hear it from the beginning.

513
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,116
Great. I wanna get into the weeds.

514
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,034
Great.

515
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:53,746
- Do you need every gory detail, or...
- I don't need it, but I can handle it.

516
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,289
You're in for a wild ride.

517
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,917
Honestly, it was
one of my proudest moments as a rabbi.

518
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,835
- Hey.
- We spent hours talking about marriage.

519
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:04,256
Examining it and reexamining it.
Pulling it apart and debating it.

520
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:05,926
So what's he gonna do?

521
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:07,760
I don't know.

522
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,345
That's the thing about Judaism.

523
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:13,517
We love to talk about things
from every direction. You know?

524
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:16,227
I was being too rigid
in how I was looking at it before.

525
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,479
I love analyzing things
from every direction.

526
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,315
I know. It's very Jewish of you.

527
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,485
A religion that encourages me to argue?

528
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,112
Love that.

529
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,574
Sorry, hold on.

530
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,869
I'm just texting my mom.

531
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,460
- Can I tell you something?
- Yeah.

532
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:42,671
You make me a better rabbi.

533
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:44,673
I definitely do.

534
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,177
What the fuck is this?

535
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:52,681
Looks like you're being evicted.

536
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,017
Yep. Yep.

537
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:58,478
Definitely being evicted.

538
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:04,442
<i>Silhouettes and a hundred days</i>

539
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:08,446
<i>I heard you're driving her crazy</i>

540
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:13,952
<i>Now her tongue's spilling out my name
It's just so fucking typical</i>

541
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:19,957
<i>I know she misses the snow</i>

542
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:23,545
<i>You're angel's 'bout ready to blow</i>

543
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:29,551
<i>I know things you wouldn't know
It's just so fucking typical</i>

544
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:35,973
<i>The harder you push
The more she's wanting to leave</i>

545
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:39,478
<i>'Cause everything you do
You do it desperately</i>

546
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:43,481
<i>You're out of touch
So she comes running to me</i>

547
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,192
<i>In all honesty</i>

548
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:46,984
<i>Honestly</i>

549
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:50,821
<i>'Cause your girl
Calls me in the middle of the night</i>

550
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:55,075
<i>Sweet talk
She likes that I'm the sentimental type</i>

551
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:59,498
<i>That's what she told me
And she only used her eyes</i>

552
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,082
<i>That's right</i>
