1
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:33,450
Hey.

2
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:34,784
Hi.

3
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:43,418
You look nice.

4
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,754
Thanks. So do you.

5
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,827
I can't deal with this tension between us.

6
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:20,120
Yes, it's awful.

7
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:22,414
- Then why didn't you say anything?
- Why didn't you?

8
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,541
I just did.

9
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:28,379
- Do you want me to leave?
- What? No, that's so mean. Uh...

10
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,049
Then do you wanna try and talk about it?

11
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:36,763
Morgan would literally kill me
if this party wasn't 100% about her.

12
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,598
Let's put it aside for now. We can table...

13
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,558
- Don't say it "table it."
- I wasn't gonna say it.

14
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,311
I was gonna say "table it."

15
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:46,689
So what should we do?

16
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:50,776
Fake it.

17
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:55,281
<i>Nobody else is so beautiful
In the dark</i>

18
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,449
<i>- Oh, oh, oh
- Giving your love</i>

19
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,618
<i>Giving your love, giving your all</i>

20
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:00,702
<i>Oh, oh, oh...</i>

21
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:02,163
Can I get a big smile?

22
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:04,331
Thank you.

23
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:05,624
<i>Oh, baby...</i>

24
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,001
Hello!

25
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:11,131
<i>To remind you of who you are...</i>

26
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,093
- Hey, guys. Thank you for coming.
- Andy.

27
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,344
- I'm just gonna...
- Hi!

28
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,221
- Hey!
- Hi! You're wearing white.

29
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,515
I bought it when we were in a fight,
to make a statement.

30
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:22,808
I didn't get another option.

31
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,309
- That's fun.
- Morgan!

32
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:28,021
Congratulations, you look beautiful.
We're so excited to be here.

33
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:29,815
This is an amazing engagement party.

34
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,318
Okay. Calm down.
Take a picture of me. Yeah.

35
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:35,195
- Yes. Oh yeah!
- You want horizontal or vertical?

36
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:36,697
- Actually, hold on.
- Yeah.

37
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,741
- Okay.
- No, actually.

38
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:42,244
Oh, you guys are taking pictures.
Hey, let us get in one. Yeah.

39
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,121
- Okay, we got it.
- I think we got.

40
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,956
- No, I don't think we got it.
- Hey, buddy.

41
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:48,667
Oh. Guys, this party kind of rules.

42
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:51,171
<i>Of who you are</i>

43
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,381
<i>Now, baby, like nobody...</i>

44
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:57,217
This dress is really working for me.

45
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:59,553
Yes, this inappropriately white dress
looks so good.

46
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,097
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

47
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,515
<i>Giving your love, giving your all</i>

48
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,142
<i>- Oh, oh, oh
- Giving your love...</i>

49
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,186
- I'm gonna get a drink.
- Okay.

50
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,688
<i>No reason Now, baby...</i>

51
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,191
- Why are you smiling so weird?
- Huh?

52
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:15,028
You're definitely
doing something weird with your face.

53
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:16,778
I don't think I'm smiling weird.

54
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:17,863
<i>Baby...</i>

55
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,489
- I don't know.
- You okay?

56
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,408
You...

57
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,993
- The nose crinkle was off-putting.
- The nose crinkle.

58
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,746
- The fuck was up with the nose crinkle?
- Like a toddler.

59
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,831
<i>When you lose yourself...</i>

60
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,875
Am I crazy, or are we having a little fun?

61
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,960
That was me faking it.
Nothing has changed.

62
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,422
Oh. Wow, you're really good at that.

63
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:37,591
Come on. I don't wanna fight with you.

64
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:40,636
I hate it when people say that.
We don't have to be fighting.

65
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:43,222
The answer is right in front of us.
Say what needs to be said.

66
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,556
- Hey.
- Hey.

67
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:45,724
Hi!

68
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:49,353
I saw you two lovers
whispering sweet nothings.

69
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:52,190
Did you two just do it in the bathroom?

70
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,817
<i>I know we're in the past</i>

71
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,819
<i>I should be okay with that</i>

72
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,781
<i>Something keeps me from letting go...</i>

73
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:04,034
- Hey. This place is amazing.
- Hey.

74
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,078
- Yeah.
- Andy's a therapist?

75
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,539
Yeah. I think he, like, overcharges
his famous clients or something?

76
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,583
I don't know.

77
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:12,418
Are you having fun?

78
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:14,211
- Mm-hmm.
- Good.

79
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,588
Yeah, I mean, I just got here,
but yeah. Yeah.

80
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,048
And you. You excited?

81
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,967
Yeah, I'm so excited.

82
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:23,053
You know, I can't believe this is my life.
It's, like, amazing.

83
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,013
Yeah, it is.
I'm really happy for you, Morgan.

84
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,223
Hm. Good.

85
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,558
God, I'm just

86
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,936
really happy, you know?

87
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,646
This is what bliss feels like, I guess.

88
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,147
Are you crying?

89
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:36,149
Yeah. Yeah. Maybe a little. I don't know.

90
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,903
I'm just very overwhelmed and
maybe a little bit hungry, and I just...

91
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:42,364
I'm just so happy.

92
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,909
Okay. Take a deep breath for me. Okay?

93
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,078
What's going on?
Are you sure these are happy tears?

94
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,162
<i>In another life...</i>

95
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:50,290
Um...

96
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,624
I don't know. I don't know.

97
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,836
I don't know. I feel weird. I feel like...

98
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,796
like, maybe I don't like him anymore?

99
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,548
- Thank God.
- I don't know. I'm on the fence.

100
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,508
I'm not sure. You know? I don't know.

101
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,719
Whoa!

102
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,678
- Okay, yeah.
- Yeah.

103
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:08,557
Which way would you like me to push you?
Because I will do whichever way you want.

104
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:09,474
- Right, um...
- Yep.

105
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,644
I think I need you to push me
to break up with him.

106
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,230
I need you to tell me
all the things you've been holding back

107
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,190
because I'm pretty sure I wanna break up,

108
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:20,861
but I just need some things to push me
over the edge so I don't go back.

109
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:24,114
Are you sure? I will let it rip,
but I need to confirm this is not a trap.

110
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,116
- Yes. Give it to me.
- Okay, all right.

111
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:29,244
At <i>Purim,</i> he berated a waiter
for stepping on his foot

112
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:31,038
and said, "These are brand-new loafers."

113
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,039
I don't love that.

114
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,875
No. He also texted Mom one time
at 11:00 p.m. and said,

115
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,877
"I had the weirdest dream about you."

116
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,086
He did that to Dad too.

117
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,171
I have, like, 50 more.

118
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,173
Do you know what really bothers me
about him?

119
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,842
Is that he weaponizes things
I said to him in therapy

120
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,844
when I thought I was in a safe space.

121
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,304
It feels very intrusive.

122
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,139
You need to do it now
while it's still fresh.

123
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,557
- What? No.
- You need to do it.

124
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:53,268
- Here? No, that's insane. Joanne.
- Unfortunately, yes.

125
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:55,228
- Oh my God.
- Go. Go do it right now.

126
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,647
You're crazy.

127
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,733
- Hey, listen.
- Yes.

128
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,402
It is gonna be okay.

129
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,197
Are you okay?

130
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:08,033
Yes. Yes. I'm good. I'm fine. I'm great.

131
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,744
Go ruin Andy's life. Okay?

132
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:13,581
Okay. Okay, I'm going. I can do this.

133
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,707
Morgan's breaking up with Andy.

134
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,667
<i>Deposits, my gloss is poppin'...</i>

135
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,336
- What?
- Yeah. Right now.

136
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,629
At their engagement party?

137
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,923
Well, she had a strong feeling.
She acted on it.

138
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:23,840
Wow!

139
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:27,470
Imagine that's hard for you to understand.
Taking action based on a strong feeling.

140
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,180
Oh shit! This is my song!

141
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,640
- Hey.
- Yo, I, uh...

142
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,558
- Record me.
- I'm in the middle of something.

143
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,061
- Check this out.
- Doing what?

144
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,772
<i>I see it, I like it
I want it, I got it...</i>

145
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:42,317
Come on, Jo. Our situation is different.
You know that. I love you.

146
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:45,404
It might be hard for you to remember,
but you love me, too, okay?

147
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,614
- You can just admit it.
- Obviously, I love you, Noah.

148
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:51,076
That's the problem. Is this... Are you
worried about what people will think?

149
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,869
- Is this a people-pleasing thing?
- No.

150
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,455
Oh shit. I fucked it up.
Shit, I fucked it up.

151
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,208
Uh, start again. Start again.

152
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,335
I'm just trying to protect us long-term.

153
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,712
Being married to a rabbi
is a very specific lifestyle.

154
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,841
What if down the road you don't want that?

155
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:09,177
Rebecca said something really similar
to that at Miriam's <i>bat mitzvah.</i>

156
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:11,263
<i>The way it shine...</i>

157
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,766
You should marry Rebecca. I'm sure
she's still available. You can reach out.

158
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,685
Okay. I'm gonna go take a walk.

159
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:20,021
Actually, no. You know what?
Why don't you take a walk?

160
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,857
<i>I want it, I got it...</i>

161
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:24,317
Go cool down. Come back
when you can have a conversation.

162
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:26,361
<i>I got it, I want it, I got it</i>

163
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:29,448
<i>You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just...</i>

164
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,616
- Did you get it? Did you get it?
- I got it.

165
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,827
Nice. That one's going straight to grid.

166
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:36,706
- Yeah, baby.
- Might even pay to boost it.

167
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:38,373
<i>Black card is my business...</i>

168
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:40,667
Okay. Well, it didn't work.
We're still together.

169
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:42,502
What? How did he convince you to stay?

170
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,254
He knows all my behavioral patterns.

171
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,506
He said the inner child in me
is afraid of being in love.

172
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:49,384
I was, like, "Is the inner child in me
afraid of being in love?"

173
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:51,428
I don't know. I'm not a professional.

174
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,805
- Just marry him, I guess.
- What? I thought you hated him.

175
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:57,100
That was when I believed in love
and thought any of us get to be happy.

176
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:58,602
That was 20 seconds ago.

177
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:01,229
What is wrong with you?
Where's Noah? He can help us solve this.

178
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,024
Honestly, Morgan, at least
he wants to marry you. Okay?

179
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,443
You should be grateful
because a bird in the hand

180
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,612
and the devil you know,
and all that stuff.

181
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,989
Can you not speak in riddles
at such a crucial time?

182
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,658
At least he knows he wants
to be with you. So just marry him.

183
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,953
You can get divorced.
That could be your brand.

184
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:19,707
Yeah.

185
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,002
- Yeah. Okay. Maybe you're right.
- Yeah.

186
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,255
- I don't wanna be on the apps anymore.
- Nobody does.

187
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:27,632
Okay, well,

188
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:30,967
I'll call up the wedding planner
and book up Santa Barbara.

189
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,052
It's gonna be beautiful.

190
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:37,683
<i>'Cause bank on me
Is the only thing I wanna say</i>

191
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:39,976
Okay, I think I know what we need.

192
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:41,228
Oh, I'm listening.

193
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,313
Let's just give ourselves six months.

194
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:46,775
Six months to just enjoy each other,
and we can take all the pressure off.

195
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,109
- That is...
- Photo?

196
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,444
Big smile for me.

197
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:50,780
Closer together.

198
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:55,034
That's your big idea, Noah? To give me
a half a year to think about it?

199
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,744
- I don't think so. No, thank you.
- Thank you.

200
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,746
- No, I'm tired of waiting around.
- No.

201
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,414
I'm... How old do you think I am?

202
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,167
- I...
- You know what? Don't answer that.

203
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:11,007
No, I think it's a wonderful time,
which... Joanne! Hi, honey.

204
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,759
I'm eating the most fantastic thing.

205
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,595
Like a delicious noodle birthday cake,
and I love it.

206
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:16,930
No. Honey, it's <i>kugel.</i>

207
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:20,183
Not as good as the kind I make.
Why is Morgan even serving <i>kugel?</i>

208
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,351
What the hell is <i>kugel?</i>

209
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,061
A Jewish food that Morgan knows I love,

210
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,772
and now she loves it, too,
because she copies everything I do.

211
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,482
Okay, Grumpy. What's wrong?

212
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:28,859
Nothing.

213
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,153
I mean, I'm...

214
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,656
I'm upset because of Morgan.

215
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:37,867
She wants out of this Dr. Andy thing,

216
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:39,995
but she doesn't know
how to break free. Okay?

217
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,454
She doesn't like him anymore.

218
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:43,290
- Oh, that's horrible.
- She looks happy.

219
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:47,252
No, she's not. And I blacked out
and told her just marry him anyway,

220
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,630
even though she hates him, which I know
is terrible advice, but I was in a mood.

221
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:53,467
- Joanne, that's terrible advice.
- I know. I just said that, Mom.

222
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,886
Andy has this, like,
weird force of will though.

223
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:59,014
He would make an amazing cult leader.

224
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,265
Okay.

225
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,602
Fasten your seat belts. I'm going in.

226
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,063
I'd make an amazing cult leader.

227
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,190
I'm handsome enough.

228
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,485
Give me that. May I have that? Thank you.

229
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:13,445
Here, drink this.

230
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,863
- What?
- I hope it's strong.

231
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,781
Just drink it.
'Cause I need you to wake up.

232
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,618
Okay. Okay, Mom. I'll drink it.

233
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,786
I didn't leave your father,

234
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,331
even though I knew I should have

235
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:25,458
years before he left me.

236
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,918
And you know why I couldn't?

237
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:29,711
It was because I...

238
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:32,797
Well, all of us have these voices
in our heads telling us

239
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:36,843
we'll never find anyone else,
or we don't deserve happiness.

240
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:40,847
Or, you know,
maybe it's our fault we're not happy.

241
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,975
I just think that,

242
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,313
I don't know, maybe I'm just impossible
to please, you know?

243
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:51,274
Like, Dr. Andy puts me
on such a high pedestal. You know?

244
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:52,901
But that's not what you want.

245
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,903
You want an equal partnership.

246
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:59,158
Someone who holds you accountable,
but sees the best in you.

247
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:02,328
Don't make the mistake I made.

248
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:06,040
You know? Trust your gut.

249
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,377
Demand what's best for you.

250
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:16,758
I'm doing it. I'm doing it.
I'm doing it. I'm doing it. I'm doing it.

251
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:21,096
It's over. It's over, Andy.
It's over. Okay, no more. Hi.

252
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,639
I was... Hey, how are y...

253
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,349
No. No. Fuck.

254
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,810
What's going on?

255
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,146
Okay.

256
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,608
Andy, I am breaking up with you
once and for all.

257
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,319
Whoa, Morgan.
I know that you're scared, but...

258
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,113
Don't do that, okay? I'm not scared.

259
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,073
At least not in the way
that you're saying that.

260
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,867
I'm scared I'm not gonna
follow through on breaking up with you,

261
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,871
and that we're just gonna end up together,
and that's not what I want.

262
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:49,458
Oh.

263
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,086
Listen, Andy.

264
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,840
I need you to repeat
my words back to me. Okay?

265
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:57,800
Okay.

266
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,180
This relationship is over.

267
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,561
This relationship is over.

268
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:13,064
- Listen, you made me feel...
- Listen, you made me feel...

269
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,482
No, no, not that, just...

270
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:17,945
- I thought you wanted me to repeat...
- No, not this part. Just listen. Okay?

271
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,991
You made me feel like I was special.

272
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,826
You know, like, you saw
all the darkest parts of me,

273
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:27,162
and you found them endearing,
and I don't know,

274
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:30,499
it made me ignore things
that I should have paid attention to.

275
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,794
And if I'm being
really honest with myself...

276
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,963
Joanne's relationship
made me rush into this with you,

277
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:39,507
and I wanted to catch up with her,

278
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:42,261
but that's not how I wanna live my life.

279
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:46,348
I see.

280
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,058
Well, as your fiancé,

281
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:51,645
I am utterly heartbroken.

282
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:56,775
Um, but as your therapist, I am...

283
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,694
I'm really proud of you, Morgan.

284
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:02,615
Thank you.

285
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,457
So she, like,

286
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,500
really wants to move in.

287
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:16,419
It's not just she really wants to move in.
She wants to move forward.

288
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,838
And I do too.

289
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,633
I need more time.

290
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:25,596
How are you and Esther?

291
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:29,974
I don't wanna rub it in, but we've been
doing really well the last couple days.

292
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,393
- Really? Good. No. That makes me happy.
- Yeah.

293
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,771
I was getting worried we were gonna be
one of those couples

294
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:37,398
where one person wakes up,
like, 20 years in,

295
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,275
and they realize
they hate the other person.

296
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:42,446
So I just, like, took the pressure off.
You know?

297
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,120
Do you ever think
that it just shouldn't be this hard?

298
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:04,218
<i>I don't hear melodies</i>

299
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,931
<i>I just hear words</i>

300
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:13,018
<i>When you say you love me</i>

301
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:18,232
<i>That's why it hurts</i>

302
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,153
<i>We used to sing symphonies</i>

303
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:27,490
<i>Now we can't carry a tune...</i>

304
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:30,285
Hey, sorry to interrupt.
Can I talk to you for a second?

305
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,287
Yeah.

306
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:35,623
<i>The way I used...</i>

307
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,001
- Hi.
- Hi.

308
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,504
We have so many things going in our favor.

309
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,256
I know. I was just thinking that

310
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:47,176
'cause my mom was saying something
about seeing the best in your partner...

311
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,345
<i>Ayin tovah.</i>

312
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,849
To look at your partner with a good eye.

313
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,602
I do that with you.

314
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,979
I do that with you too.

315
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,858
<i>We used to be colorful...</i>

316
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:04,987
There are a hundred different ways
I could convince you to be with me,

317
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,281
but I'm not gonna do that.

318
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,116
Nothing good happens when it's forced.

319
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:13,704
I don't wanna be the person
who's asking you to be someone different.

320
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,208
We can't start our life that way.
You'd wake up in 20 years, you'd hate me.

321
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,295
Okay.

322
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,131
Sorry, so what are you saying?

323
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,051
I'm saying I'm all out of ideas. I don't...

324
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,052
I don't have any more.

325
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:32,138
<i>There's no need to lie</i>

326
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,681
<i>The right thing's the...</i>

327
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:36,101
- So you're just giving up?
- It's not giving up.

328
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:37,895
It's not giving up.

329
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,940
It is accepting the truth
of our situation.

330
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,694
Is this happening right now?

331
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,739
Are we breaking up right now?

332
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,286
I don't know what other choice we have.

333
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:57,205
I love you.

334
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,539
<i>We used to sing...</i>

335
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,667
But we can't keep doing this.
It's too hard.

336
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:04,922
<i>Now we can't carry a tune...</i>

337
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,051
Please tell Morgan
I'm sorry I had to leave.

338
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,847
<i>The way I used to</i>

339
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,686
<i>I wanna hear melodies</i>

340
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,440
<i>The way I used to</i>

341
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:29,989
<i>Fourth time's a charm
Or something like that</i>

342
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:33,783
<i>Bleach on my cloth...</i>

343
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:34,910
How you doing?

344
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,871
- I'm good.
- Oh, good.

345
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,793
I've noticed
you haven't been yourself lately.

346
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,420
Oh, that's a start.

347
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,964
So

348
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,465
I am going to stay out of your way.

349
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:53,386
<i>Flashes of fire, but I'm coming back...</i>

350
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,973
I've been trying to figure this out
for us or

351
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:57,598
for you.

352
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,517
Yeah.

353
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,019
Reigniting the spark, as they say.

354
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,021
Gosh.

355
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:05,023
You're the greatest guy
in the whole world.

356
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,608
And the best dad.

357
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:11,195
- And just a fantastic, lovable weirdo.
- Mm-hmm.

358
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:15,783
<i>You've been gone, back
But can't let you go...</i>

359
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:18,787
You've honestly done everything for me.

360
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,499
And I know how hard you've tried.

361
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,084
I do.

362
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,046
<i>I did everything just...</i>

363
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,131
But it's... But it's not working.

364
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:33,718
<i>Can't let you go...</i>

365
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,429
It's not working, and I...

366
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,974
And I don't know why.

367
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,685
But what I do know
is that it's me right now,

368
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:45,939
and I can't fix it while we're together.

369
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,317
I can't believe I just said that.

370
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,444
<i>My love</i>

371
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,655
<i>You love me back...</i>

372
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,575
That makes two of us.

373
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,951
<i>You and me both</i>

374
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:01,413
<i>Have been intense</i>

375
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:07,710
<i>Took it too far and you know it</i>

376
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:11,589
<i>Spray paint the car
When you're hurting</i>

377
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:15,343
<i>Even though everything's burning</i>

378
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:18,471
<i>I want you to know it's all worth it</i>

379
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,973
<i>My hands are right on your back</i>

380
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:23,059
<i>And yours on my shoulder</i>

381
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,894
<i>Don't see eye to eye</i>

382
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:29,774
<i>But we're nose to nose tonight</i>

383
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:33,820
<i>Just can't let you go</i>

384
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:37,449
<i>Everything's on my back</i>

385
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,075
You wanna dance?

386
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,078
<i>Go</i>

387
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:44,915
<i>We dance in the smoke</i>

388
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,583
<i>We dance in the smoke...</i>

389
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,210
This night is so fucked.

390
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,088
It is so fucked.

391
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,549
Do you need me to, like, beat anybody up
for you? Are you okay?

392
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,343
No, I feel pretty good about my decision.

393
00:18:57,344 --> 00:19:01,598
People are probably gonna start calling me
the runaway bride or whatever, but...

394
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,809
This is only your first time.
It's not like this was the wedding.

395
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:05,769
Yeah.

396
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,104
Are you trying to give yourself
a nickname?

397
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,398
I'm just saying people are probably
gonna call me that.

398
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:12,817
Okay. I'll call...
I'll call you that if you want.

399
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:17,488
<i>Dancing with you...</i>

400
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:18,615
Hey, um...

401
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,119
I'm really sorry about Esther.

402
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:23,494
Yeah.

403
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,079
<i>Know it</i>

404
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,080
<i>Spray paint the...</i>

405
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,916
I mean, if she thinks
that she can just, like, go out there

406
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,002
and see what life is
on the other side without me,

407
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,713
and I'll just, like, wait
and take her back...

408
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,381
<i>know it's all worth it...</i>

409
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,884
she's absolutely right.

410
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:38,968
Yeah.

411
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,346
I mean, if this is for life,
I gotta ride with her.

412
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,516
You're a good guy.

413
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,643
It's almost like I'm too good to be true.

414
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:49,520
- Except I'm real.
- Okay.

415
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,397
I'm right here. I'm real.

416
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:55,026
<i>Can't let you go</i>

417
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:58,614
<i>We dance in the smoke</i>

418
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:03,034
<i>Dance in the smoke</i>

419
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:09,875
<i>Dancing with you</i>

420
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:17,674
<i>Dancing with you</i>

421
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,938
Oh, hi.

422
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:32,898
Hi.

423
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,568
Are you okay?

424
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,194
<i>You take my hand...</i>

425
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,238
No.

426
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,990
- Do you wanna talk about it?
- No.

427
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,743
<i>My mouth is dry...</i>

428
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:47,119
You look horrible. Let's do you.

429
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,415
<i>Let's go down to the water</i>

430
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,876
<i>The water...</i>

431
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,044
<i>If the world...</i>

432
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:58,006
I think Noah and I are really done.

433
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:03,512
I can't really talk about it though,
'cause I'm afraid I'm gonna start crying.

434
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,139
That doesn't even make sense.

435
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:12,187
You know how when something big happens,
you start to think about all these little,

436
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,398
like, random things?

437
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:18,651
Like, I'm really gonna miss <i>Shabbat.</i>

438
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:19,777
Which is so deranged.

439
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:23,907
Like, I'm gonna miss being told to put
away my phone on Friday nights.

440
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,535
And I love being superstitious.

441
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,829
I say pooh, pooh, pooh
to things all the time now,

442
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,330
just 'cause it makes me feel good.

443
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:34,751
Of course. Pooh, pooh, pooh is so good.

444
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,964
So keep doing <i>Shabbat.</i>

445
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,883
You're basically Jewish.

446
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:44,844
I wish.

447
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,847
No. Joanne, I'm serious. Like...

448
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,057
I feel like you have this idea
of being Jewish

449
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:53,145
that's so much more complicated
than it actually is.

450
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:56,773
I mean, you feel Jewish to me.

451
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:59,443
You're warm and cozy.

452
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:02,696
You always wanna chat about everything.

453
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:06,033
You'd be a pretty good get for us.

454
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,660
Well, you're not warm and cozy.

455
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:13,122
Well, you're not...
Funny, see? You're funny.

456
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,333
That's Jewish.

457
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,667
You love to overshare.

458
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,586
God, no matter how much I resisted,

459
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,588
you literally forced me
to be friends with you.

460
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:23,674
Forced. I mean, you're a true <i>kibitzer.</i>

461
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,135
You're always getting
in everybody's business.

462
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:29,138
You ever heard of a <i>yenta</i>, Joanne?
That's you.

463
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,766
You're a <i>yenta</i>.

464
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:32,099
I'm a <i>yenta</i>?

465
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,934
Yeah, of course you are.

466
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:38,230
I mean, you're obsessed with your family,
even though they are so nuts. Jewish.

467
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:41,776
You're always eating the challah
before you're supposed to. We all do that.

468
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,988
Jewish. Like, I don't really know
what you're waiting for.

469
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:48,533
Whether it's a sign,
or the waters to part, or what, but...

470
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:54,039
The whole thing is just a feeling,
and enjoying all those little things

471
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,291
is the feeling.

472
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,555
With or without Noah, you're Jewish.

473
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,150
I have to go.

474
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:24,152
I...

475
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:27,280
<i>Leave it on the line</i>

476
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:30,991
<i>See you cutting down
On things you like</i>

477
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:34,203
<i>Smiling like
You're not spitting out spite</i>

478
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:37,249
<i>I could hardly recognize you</i>

479
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:41,043
<i>No one's making you stay</i>

480
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:44,422
<i>Know I hate it
When you look at me that way</i>

481
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,841
<i>I try with you</i>

482
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,843
<i>And you're holding your breath</i>

483
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:51,637
<i>Too scared of where it's gonna take ya</i>

484
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:55,474
<i>Feels like you're looking for a sign
Like a green light, green eyes</i>

485
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:57,936
<i>Everybody has what you want...</i>

486
00:23:59,104 --> 00:23:59,938
Hey.

487
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:01,982
Hey, where's Joanne?

488
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:03,441
I think she left.

489
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,067
- She left?
- I think so.

490
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,986
<i>Oh, I bite my tongue</i>

491
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,612
<i>Can you swallow your pride?</i>

492
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:12,784
<i>Do you really even want it?
Is it ruining your life?</i>

493
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:38,058
<i>Please love me
Love me like you used to...</i>

494
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:40,729
None of it matters. You are my soulmate.

495
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:42,481
That's it.

496
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:45,901
I don't care if you're Jewish.
I don't care if you're not Jewish.

497
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:48,403
I choose you.

498
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:50,155
Every time.

499
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,115
Well, you're in luck.

500
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:56,160
<i>How to love you</i>

501
00:24:56,161 --> 00:25:00,164
<i>Tell me how to hold you</i>

502
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:04,293
<i>I'll be who you want to</i>

503
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:07,756
<i>Baby, let me know</i>

504
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:12,468
<i>Show me how to please you</i>

505
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:16,472
<i>Baby, this is real</i>

506
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:20,476
<i>I'll be who you want to</i>

507
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:24,981
<i>Babe, please make me feel</i>
