1
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:16,140
<i>Okay, let's catch up
our listeners. So you might remember</i>

2
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:17,349
<i>that, against all odds,</i>

3
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,602
<i>the Prophet and I fell in love,
and we became an adorable couple.</i>

4
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:23,230
<i>Then, at a very fun bat mitzvah
for his niece,</i>

5
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:25,232
<i>I freaked out and broke it off with him.</i>

6
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:27,234
<i>I was actually being very selfless,</i>

7
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:29,486
<i>putting his career over my own happiness.</i>

8
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:31,822
<i>Anyway, he ran after me
in a very romantic way.</i>

9
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:34,283
<i>It was as if I planned the whole thing,
but I swear I didn't.</i>

10
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,452
<i>And now we're making it work.</i>

11
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:39,539
<i>We're actually... We've made it work.
We're an amazing couple.</i>

12
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,501
<i>Anyway, I am in a big, beautiful,
healthy relationship</i>

13
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:47,921
<i>with a real-life adult man,
and I think it's solid enough for me</i>

14
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:50,340
<i>to stop using a nickname
when I talk about him.</i>

15
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:53,677
<i>Whoa, okay, we did not discuss
this. Um, also, sorry, is it that solid?</i>

16
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:56,013
<i>I feel like you guys have a lot
you haven't figured out</i>

17
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,057
<i>that's very important.
You know what I mean?</i>

18
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,893
<i>Okay, you... you will understand,
Morgan, when you are in love.</i>

19
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,979
<i>We are living in the present.
Not the past. Not the future.</i>

20
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,814
- Oh, that's a foul! That's a foul!
- Yes!

21
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:08,942
Number eight grabbed it out of his hands.
Major flag on the play.

22
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:12,321
It's okay. They're allowed to do that.
They're allowed.

23
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,697
That's stupid.

24
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:15,449
<i>Anyway, his name is Noah,</i>

25
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,825
and he's a rabbi.

26
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:19,953
Yes, you heard that correct.
He is a rabbi.

27
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:22,331
And what else? We're in love.

28
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:25,084
Breaking news. You're in a psychotically
annoying relationship.

29
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,086
Way to make
all our single listeners feel bad.

30
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,838
No, this relationship is inspirational.

31
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:34,009
I am dating a man who has
glass water carafes next to his bed.

32
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,931
Mm. I wonder when the other shoe
is gonna drop, and what it will be.

33
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:40,266
Ah, the mysteries of life.

34
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,937
Hey. I'm going over my notes
for this weekend.

35
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,815
I'm gonna make the pomodoro,
you're making the cucumber salad,

36
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,651
and then Ryann's boyfriend
is gonna bring appetizers?

37
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:53,153
Uh, one appetizer, yes.

38
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:57,491
Uh, but they're these, like, fancy little
cheese balls that will change your life.

39
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,452
Great. Writing it down.

40
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,039
Okay. Here we go.

41
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:05,041
All right.

42
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:06,375
Are you ready?

43
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,794
Oh yeah. Just do it.

44
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:12,214
- God!
- Oh.

45
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,383
- Damn it. Those toes are cold.
- Yeah.

46
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,884
Can I please put socks on you?

47
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:18,679
No, because then I'm gonna get too hot.
You know?

48
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,472
No, I get it. That's logical.

49
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:21,850
Hold my hand.

50
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:26,019
I'm saying a relationship isn't solid
until you're out of the honeymoon phase.

51
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,521
We are out of the honeymoon phase.

52
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:30,190
What? No you're not. You've been together
for, like, five minutes.

53
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,525
The real test is, you know,

54
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:34,027
when you merge your lives
and you blend your friends.

55
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:36,822
That's what we're doing.
We're hosting our first dinner party,

56
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,950
which you're invited to, by the way,
and you still haven't RSVP'd.

57
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:42,077
Okay. I'm RSVPing right now. Calm down.

58
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:44,204
Right now, this here, this is my RSVP.

59
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:48,209
Okay? Also, first dinner party, huh?
It's, like, a lot of pressure.

60
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,587
Can you please stop
poking holes in my story?

61
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:54,548
Okay? I'm unveiling my relationship.
I am trying to stay positive.

62
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:58,218
Noah has put almost everything
he cares about on the line for me.

63
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:01,514
Okay. Wow. Clearly, I struck a nerve.

64
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:07,353
Anyway, um... His name is Noah.

65
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,523
- Love a hand lotion, don't you?
- Yeah. Of course.

66
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,070
Yeah. Just...

67
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,033
You do like how I updated my room, right?

68
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,369
The woman at the store
said it was masculine minimalist.

69
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,705
So sweet.

70
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,875
- You can be talked into anything.
- Mm-hmm.

71
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,585
No, I like it.

72
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:32,920
- I have my system.
- Yeah.

73
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,880
<i>Hold on till the end...</i>

74
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,548
I like your system.

75
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,218
My system? My system is very complicated.

76
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,845
Oh, I think I've...

77
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,763
figured it out a few times.

78
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:48,853
<i>No one can make a wish
That's better than this, yeah</i>

79
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:52,689
Oh.

80
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,317
Noah. Come on in. Have a seat.

81
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:58,237
Thanks for seeing me.
I won't take up too much of your time.

82
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,530
Just wanted to come in
and clear a few things up

83
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:04,118
because, um, you know, this opportunity,

84
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,620
it's my dream job.

85
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:09,831
That's what I was thinking,
and then you went a little MIA,

86
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:11,124
as the kids would say.

87
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:15,296
- Well...
- The temple chatter has a lot of theories.

88
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,423
I don't listen to it,

89
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:19,634
but I hear it.

90
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:23,220
Okay. And you're referring to Joanne.

91
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,598
Love is crazy.

92
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:27,140
Yeah.

93
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:30,018
My girlfriend in college,
she kept telling me

94
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:33,021
that she was going to stop taking walks
with her high school sweetheart,

95
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:38,152
but in the end, she was cheating on me
with him the whole time.

96
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,197
And I married her anyway.

97
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,617
That doesn't seem... Judy?

98
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,078
- Your current wife, Judy?
- Yeah.

99
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:52,249
Okay. Well, listen, like I was saying,
Joanne is going to convert.

100
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,043
You know, she just wants to do it
on her own timeline, and...

101
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:58,088
As she should,
but it is a very difficult decision.

102
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,507
Sorry to interrupt.

103
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:04,928
- I have your lunch, Rabbi Cohen.
- Oh.

104
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:07,056
Also, Rabbi Noah,

105
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,560
glass carafes by the bed
is king shit. Slay.

106
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,354
Huh?

107
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:18,025
Joanne talked about them on the pod.
My uncle has those at his house.

108
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,068
He's gay.

109
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:22,989
Hm. Hm.

110
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,662
- Is that Chardonnay? I hate Chardonnay.
- You hate Chardonnay. Ah, see?

111
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,331
That is why we are bringing this.

112
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,750
For the love of my life
only drinks Sauvignon Blanc.

113
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:38,462
And this is a joke Chardonnay that Noah
and I regift every couple of months.

114
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:41,340
Oh, I'm familiar. Maybe no bits tonight.
Leave it in the car.

115
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,843
- Okay.
- Is the, uh, sister gonna be there?

116
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,513
- She'll probably be there.
- Don't even think about being nice to her.

117
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,515
- Of course not.
- Don't even say hello to her.

118
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:51,433
I'd never do that.

119
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:55,187
But don't completely ignore her so
she thinks we had a conversation about it

120
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,564
and I'm threatened by her,
because I don't care.

121
00:05:57,565 --> 00:06:00,525
Maybe just, like, say hello or...
No, that's too nice.

122
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:03,987
Like, just say hello, and then that's it.
Just be done.

123
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,197
Okay, yeah. No, 100%.

124
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,406
- That makes sense.
- Okay.

125
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:10,118
And there's, like, nothing there.
You know, we were just texting dumb stuff.

126
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,746
- Right.
- We were just having fun.

127
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,998
You think she's fun?

128
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:15,874
You have fun with her?

129
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,627
No. No, no, no. I do not think she is fun.

130
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,004
She is not fun.

131
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:22,340
This is fun.

132
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,468
There is an art
to throwing a great dinner party,

133
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,220
and seating is the foundation.

134
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,430
- Do you know what the second part is?
- No.

135
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:31,431
- Lighting.
- Mm-hmm.

136
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:33,226
Would you like to handle lighting?

137
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:37,687
<i>Moi?</i> I would be honored.

138
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:41,066
When Morgan and I go to parties
or weddings and we're not seated together,

139
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,276
we just switch the name tags.

140
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,113
You don't actually do that, do you?

141
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:49,116
I... don't do it anymore, no.

142
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,076
- Good.
- Not since you looked at me like that.

143
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:55,205
You think it's gonna be weird having
Morgan and Sasha and Esther all together?

144
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,998
No, I think it's gonna be fine.

145
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:59,752
This is gonna be great.
It's gonna be great.

146
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:03,046
- Okay.
- Okay, I'm on lighting.

147
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,631
This is 20%,

148
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:05,716
50%,

149
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,094
70%.

150
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,346
Yikes, that's an airport bathroom.
Okay, no.

151
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:12,264
You know what?

152
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,184
I should just make an executive decision.
You're right. Right?

153
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,646
- Hey, yeah.
- Uh, question for you.

154
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,817
Did you make fun of my water carafes
on the podcast?

155
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:24,734
- What?
- Yeah.

156
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:27,780
Did I make fun? No.
I was bragging about your water carafes.

157
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,115
Of course. Okay, great.

158
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:33,827
Uh, well... Look,
I don't wanna censor you or anything,

159
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:36,873
but maybe no personal stuff

160
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:38,665
about me on the pod?

161
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:39,958
Okay, yeah. No, got it.

162
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,003
I didn't think
water carafes were personal.

163
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,465
They're not. I guess they're not.

164
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,841
- Okay.
- Okay. Sorry.

165
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,926
All right, carafes are back on the table.

166
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,762
Love it. Our first guest.

167
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:53,972
Hey.

168
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,348
Spencer dumped me.

169
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:57,185
- Oh no!
- Oh no.

170
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,478
Is that what you're wearing?

171
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,395
No.

172
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:02,022
Oh, Ryann, I'm so sorry.

173
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,024
Oh, that's terrible.

174
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:07,652
Oh, did he do it
after he made the cheese balls or...

175
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,488
No. He did it this morning.

176
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,657
Just completely out of nowhere.
No warning.

177
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:13,867
- No warning?
- No warning.

178
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,703
Are you sure there wasn't anything
that you did or didn't do?

179
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:19,289
'Cause sometimes you can be...
That's not important. You know what?

180
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,626
I know what you need. Shots.
And just not even think about this.

181
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,044
Just tonight, have fun, okay?

182
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:27,797
No, thanks. Maybe find a place to lay down
so I can be around people.

183
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,216
- I'll get the tea.
- Okay.

184
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,258
Okay.

185
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,677
Um, this is our first dinner party
as a couple.

186
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,472
There's a lot riding on it,
so I need you to lighten the mood.

187
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,350
I feel like you're not hearing me.

188
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,355
Wanna borrow something to wear?

189
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:44,314
Hello.

190
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,232
- Hey.
- Hi.

191
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,983
Good. You two are still together.

192
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:49,528
- What? Why would we not be together?
- That's not what I meant.

193
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,112
Just a thing with some other guests

194
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:53,740
who are no longer in the running
to be our favorite couple friends.

195
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,242
Great. You and I are in first place.

196
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,452
There you go.
Esther, wanna be my best friend?

197
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:58,912
- No, I'm all set.
- Okay.

198
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,623
- Ow! You just shut the door on me!
- Oh my God.

199
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,124
I'm sorry. I didn't see you.

200
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,795
- Come on in.
- Wow, that's quite an outfit.

201
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,548
Oh. What? What? You told us to dress up.

202
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:10,925
- Uh-huh.
- Mm-hmm.

203
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,176
It's fashion.

204
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:15,470
Sorry, I didn't bring anything. I, um...

205
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:16,889
I don't do that, so...

206
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,351
Hi.

207
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,021
Hi.

208
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:27,441
Hello.

209
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:31,278
Is... I'm sorry. Are you guys ignoring me?
What's going on?

210
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,280
No. No, I'm not...

211
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,781
I'm not... I'm not ignoring you.

212
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:35,700
- Okay.
- I'm not...

213
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,662
You know, there are just ti...
There are just times when

214
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:44,333
people sometimes
look at a situation from many...

215
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:45,750
Yes.

216
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,211
I was talking to somebody
about that the other day.

217
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:50,672
- Okay. Yeah, we're gonna have a talk.
- Okay.

218
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:51,965
- Me?
- Sash.

219
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,633
Whore number two, let's do it.

220
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:54,552
A chat.

221
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:59,681
- We should follow them and listen?
- No, we let them figure it out.

222
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,934
- Exactly what I was thinking.
- Yeah. Okay.

223
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,814
All right. Well, okey dokey, artichokies.

224
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:08,816
Let's go.

225
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:12,152
- You're gonna stand up the whole time?
- No, I'm gonna...

226
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,070
Okay.

227
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:16,616
Oh, this is fabulous. What?

228
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,829
I just wanna say that I'm in no way
prepared to have a threesome.

229
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,164
- In what world?
- What?

230
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,583
Not how I thought this was gonna go.
I... I could do it.

231
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:30,045
In what world do you think
this is the threesome I would initiate?

232
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,880
- Neither of you would be involved.
- Agreed.

233
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,506
Wait. I wouldn't be there?

234
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:36,718
This is not a threesome.
This is just a conversation.

235
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,220
Well, most threesomes
probably start with a conversation.

236
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:42,474
I have literally never started a threesome
with a conversation, but...

237
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,517
- You don't lay down ground rules?
- I... Okay.

238
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:46,311
How many threesomes have you been in?

239
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,687
- Lenny!
- Good to see you.

240
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,230
- I fucking miss you!
- Good to see you.

241
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:52,025
- I like this. This is very good.
- Yeah, I thought it was good.

242
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,652
Who's here? Give me the lay of the land.

243
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,488
Oh, just a casual gathering of friends.
Let's see.

244
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,823
There's, uh, Esther and my brother,
of course.

245
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:02,994
Joanne. Um, Ashley will be coming.
She's a lesbian, so not for you.

246
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:06,998
Ryann is crying on the floor.
And, um, Morgan.

247
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,125
Morgan.

248
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:10,335
I like that name.

249
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,420
So this is a setup. Dude, I love you.

250
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,838
It's not a setup.

251
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,467
It's just friends and two single people
sitting next to each other at dinner.

252
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,886
And if sparks fly, it's out of my control.

253
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:23,306
Look, I don't know what weird stuff
went on between the two of you.

254
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:26,851
I don't know what, but I'd like to say
that I'm deading it right now.

255
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,478
No. Nothing happened.

256
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:31,857
I'm gonna be the judge
of what is something and what is nothing.

257
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,609
I saw all the text messages.

258
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:35,652
Mm.

259
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,988
Okay, we're just friends.

260
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,740
I mean, we were friends.
We're not friends now.

261
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,659
But we were at one point,
but now we're not.

262
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,537
Well, it did get a little bit weird.

263
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,913
And I told him it was weird.

264
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,748
- You agreed that it was weird.
- Sasha?

265
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:51,334
- Yes, I agreed that it was weird.
- That's what I thought.

266
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,253
- Yes.
- But nothing happened.

267
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,380
- This woman means nothing to me.
- That's true.

268
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,965
She is nothing.

269
00:11:56,966 --> 00:12:00,468
- Literally, at her core, she is nothing.
- Wow. Great. Okay, rude.

270
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,430
- No, I didn't mean it like that.
- You didn't?

271
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:04,931
- No, I did.
- You... Okay.

272
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,891
I'm sorry. I'm not great with conflict.

273
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:10,019
Okay, I'll just make it, like,
a little bit easier for all of us.

274
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,857
I am your wife, and I'll just decide
who you're friends with.

275
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:14,858
- Great.
- Great.

276
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:18,737
So here's what I think happened.
I think whore number two...

277
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:22,365
- You can just call me Morgan, it's...
- It's a term of endearment at this point.

278
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:27,287
Sure, Morgan, you saw your sister,
like, all loved up in a new relaish,

279
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:29,497
and you got a crush
on the hotter older brother.

280
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,124
- Yeah.
- Classic.

281
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,335
It's not even the crushing that I hated.

282
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,755
It's really more the laughing together
and the inside jokes,

283
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,799
and I just need to remind everyone,

284
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,468
I am also fun.

285
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,972
Oh, babe, you're the most fun.

286
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:47,725
Okay, I just have to say that, um,

287
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:52,021
I've never seen you be fun,
but I'm really looking forward to it.

288
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:57,066
And I just have to say
that this was a fucking warning,

289
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,694
and I'm really good at revenge.

290
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,362
Okay. Fun.

291
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,281
That was fun.

292
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,324
- Hi.
- Hey.

293
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,492
- Oh, hey.
- How are you?

294
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:06,659
What's goin' on?

295
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,829
- Hey, what's up, bro?
- What's good, bro?

296
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:10,705
- I'm gonna...
- Hi.

297
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,958
- What's your name?
- Morgan. Yeah.

298
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:19,506
Sure, I'd fuck her.

299
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,800
Nope, don't love that. Can't do that.

300
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,302
- Um, mm-mm.
- I meant it as a compliment. She's hot.

301
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,387
I understand,
but she's my girlfriend's sister.

302
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:27,722
Do you think you can be serious?

303
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:30,767
I need to plant deep roots
in the ground with Joanne, right?

304
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:34,395
And we gotta merge our worlds together,
and you being with her sister,

305
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:35,730
that'd be so great.

306
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:36,981
- So great.
- Okay.

307
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,650
- Yeah, take a deep breath.
- Okay.

308
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,693
You ever hosted a dinner party before?

309
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:41,861
- You're right.
- Yeah.

310
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:44,072
- You're right. You know what? It's casual.
- It's casual.

311
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,533
- Don't overthink it. Have fun.
- Don't overthink it. Yeah.

312
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,535
See you in there.

313
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:50,162
Hey, how'd it go? What happened?

314
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,790
I don't know, man. It got sexual.

315
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:54,959
That's all I'm gonna say about it.

316
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:02,382
<i>Tell me the truth, boy</i>

317
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,467
<i>Am I losing you...</i>

318
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:07,555
Assigned seats? That doesn't feel casual.

319
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,931
<i>We used to kiss...</i>

320
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,517
What? My name's not even
the same color ink as everyone else.

321
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,853
Fine, you weren't originally invited,
okay? Get over it.

322
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,146
- The disrespect. Hi, I'm Ashley.
- Hi.

323
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:18,898
I'm sort of the glue of the group.

324
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,317
Oh, that's cool. I'm Lenny.
Noah and I ball together.

325
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:22,944
Why do guys have so many hobbies?

326
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,905
Uh, ball's really more of a lifestyle
than a hobby.

327
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:29,701
Totally. We have hobbies because we refuse
to accept the chokehold of adulthood

328
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,870
that continues to strangle us
every single day.

329
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,497
- Preach.
- That's not why I play. I'm an adult.

330
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,791
- It's... It's too much.
- I'm gonna need something stronger.

331
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:37,876
Yeah, it's intense.

332
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:41,338
Ryann, do you want me to get you
a plate of food? Or maybe I can feed you?

333
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,341
That's really nice, but I...
I think I just need to lay here

334
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:49,137
and sort of replay everything over
and over in my head until it makes sense.

335
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,555
Do what you have to do.

336
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,765
<i>Tell me the truth, boy</i>

337
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:56,978
<i>Am I losing you for good?</i>

338
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,688
- Thank you.
- I think...

339
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,983
- Oh my God, really?
- No, I actually...

340
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:05,069
I get mistaken for Zooey Deschanel,
like, twice a week.

341
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:09,991
I was in Beverly Hills the other day,
and this paparazzi was like, "Zooey!"

342
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,409
- I was like, "I'm not..."
- What?

343
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,912
I'm sorry. Don't get mad.
I... I just don't see it.

344
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:17,957
I'm not always mad, Ashley.
Jesus, I'm also very fun.

345
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,835
- She's fun.
- You know what I think happened?

346
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:24,255
I think that he saw me
taking the hair out of my hairbrush

347
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:28,343
and balling it up and throwing it away,
and I think that really grossed him out.

348
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,428
- We're eating.
- I shouldn't have done that.

349
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:34,265
- Morgan, how tall are you? Like, 5'10"?
- Oh, no, I'm, uh... I'm 5'9", so...

350
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:37,226
Oh, that's cool. Were you tall as a kid
and felt kind of awkward about it?

351
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:39,437
Oh, no, not at all.
I didn't have an awkward phase.

352
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,731
I was always very cool
and very pretty, so, yeah.

353
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,900
- That's cool. No, that's great for you.
- Sorry.

354
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,319
Does anyone know which of these dips
go with this?

355
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,781
- I feel like the green goes well...
- Look at our worlds. Merging.

356
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:50,740
That in there?

357
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,284
- Mix all three.
- I did get my finger in there.

358
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,994
- It's a pesto.
- Trust it.

359
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:57,246
So you're converting to Judaism.

360
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,624
Welcome to the tribe.

361
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:01,418
Mm.

362
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,672
No, we're gonna do
the whole, like, interfaith thing.

363
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,091
Uh, well...

364
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,134
I mean, I think we agreed
to table it for now,

365
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,554
and then you would decide
in your own timeline.

366
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,890
Right? I totally respect that.
I think that's very cool.

367
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:20,104
Maybe it's because I called his mom "Mom"
and not your mom.

368
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,397
I mean, I'm not his fucking sister.

369
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,357
- Yeah, that's the one.
- That was it.

370
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:28,487
I didn't think we tabled it.
I thought we... we took it off the table.

371
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,074
Off the table? Oh. Oh, okay.

372
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,076
- Yeah, is that not...
- No, as in never?

373
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,412
You guys wanna sidebar this
until after dinner or...

374
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,665
- Did we have two different conversations?
- It seems like we did.

375
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,626
- What else could you have...
- Joanne, I think you need to pee.

376
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,671
- Do you need to go to the bathroom?
- Yep.

377
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,257
And we're going. Come on.

378
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,347
We're done. That's it. It's over.

379
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:59,100
Okay, but how right was I
about the other shoe dropping?

380
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,602
- Morgan, this is my real relationship.
- Okay, sorry.

381
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:04,647
How could we have been on such
different pages about that conversation?

382
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:09,111
I don't know. I mean, I honestly sort of
thought that you guys had tabled it too.

383
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,155
Morgan, do not repeat that.

384
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,240
- Okay.
- Jesus.

385
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:16,952
We're done. Okay. Well, I guess
I should've seen this coming.

386
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:19,412
Joanne, you're being dramatic.

387
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:22,916
The honeymoon phase is over.
Now the real relationship starts. Okay?

388
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,546
Okay, listen.
I have to tell you something.

389
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,673
But I have to give you a warning.
It's not about you.

390
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:32,384
- Okay?
- Okay.

391
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:35,386
Sasha said something earlier.
He told me I was nothing.

392
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,680
Why would he say that?
I'm not nothing, you know?

393
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,808
Wait, who cares about Sasha?
Focus on Lenny.

394
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:41,809
Wait, who's Lenny?

395
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,771
The guy sitting right next to you.

396
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,732
Oh my God. Oh my God. Joanne.
Is this a setup? Are you kidding me?

397
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:51,152
The adult man in a vest?
Come on. I am so out of his league.

398
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,987
Mm, maybe that's a good thing. You know?

399
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:55,823
Maybe he'll become obsessed with you.
Don't you wanna be worshipped?

400
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,659
I do love being worshipped.

401
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,287
Wait, I wanna see the little shelf
next to your bed that you pile stuff on.

402
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:03,539
Not now. Everything's falling apart.

403
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,084
Oh my God. Jesus.
Where are you going so fast?

404
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,835
I've gotta tuck in my shirt.

405
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,879
This playlist is sick.

406
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,716
What? This playlist is horrible.
Okay, changing the vibe.

407
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:16,552
<i>It feel good
Waving your hands in the air...</i>

408
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:18,137
- Unexpected.
- Okay.

409
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:21,224
<i>Yeah, yeah, uh, ye-ye-ye-yeah...</i>

410
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:24,310
- Could somebody fix the lighting, please?
- I knew it was wrong.

411
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,063
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...</i>

412
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:27,563
It's good.

413
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:30,108
I'm just not afraid
to be the only one dancing.

414
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,819
That is me. Fun.

415
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:33,445
So fun.

416
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:34,946
Look at you.

417
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,072
- Yeah, right?
- Wow.

418
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,324
- Okay, that's my cue.
- Yeah, save yourself.

419
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:39,408
Are you leaving?

420
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:42,995
- Mm-hmm. It was nice meeting you.
- Okay, so, um...

421
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:45,289
<i>If you did it then
Then you'd probably...</i>

422
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,375
Well,

423
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,585
do you, uh, want my number or...

424
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,880
Oh. No, it's all good.
I'm sure I'll see you around.

425
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,006
- Oh.
- Yeah, right there.

426
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,342
Yeah. Cool.

427
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,053
- Thanks for having me. Nice to meet you.
- Same.

428
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,054
Young and wild and free, baby.

429
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,181
Okay, I got excited about the pie though.

430
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:03,099
Okay.

431
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,559
<i>You really are a gem, baby girl</i>

432
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,018
- Hey, can we talk?
- Mm-hmm.

433
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:08,313
Yeah, sure. Let's get this over with.

434
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:11,357
This is bad.

435
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,861
Well, yeah, it's not great. Uh...

436
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,905
So when did you decide
that you're just never converting?

437
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:20,700
- I don't know what to do with that.
- I didn't... You... I just...

438
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,785
I thought you said I choose you, so...

439
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:26,665
- I do choose you. But I was just...
- But... But only if I convert?

440
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:33,462
I mean, look, it's not a rule.
I was just hoping

441
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:37,843
it would be something
you would want to do eventually.

442
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,054
And if you don't, then, I...

443
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,600
I don't know.
It really complicates my life.

444
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:53,233
I can't decide
if it's what I want for myself

445
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:57,320
with that pressure on me.

446
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,363
I know.

447
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,490
I know.

448
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:09,124
Are we doomed?

449
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,627
Excuse me?

450
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,005
You're not allowed to...
No. I'm the cynical one.

451
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:16,923
I say stuff like that.

452
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:19,133
When you say stuff like that, it's scary.

453
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,719
Well, it is a little scary.

454
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,265
Where did that come from?

455
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,768
<i>Cold sweat, hot-headed believer</i>

456
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:29,686
Oh.

457
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,147
Well, I saw you kept building
that tower of all your stuff,

458
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,733
so I got you a nightstand for it.

459
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:38,028
I mean, it doesn't really
go with the room, but...

460
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,030
Are you kidding me?

461
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:41,823
What? Is it weird?

462
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,408
Are you kidding me?

463
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:44,909
- Noah!
- Yes.

464
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,953
- Are you kidding me?
- Oh, you like it.

465
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,537
Noah!

466
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:52,625
It's the most romantic thing
that anyone's ever done on planet Earth.

467
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:56,254
You got me a nightstand for my tower.

468
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,840
<i>It takes me all the way...</i>

469
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,802
I mean, who even thinks of that?

470
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:03,887
I do.

471
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,516
I just want you to be happy.

472
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,810
I am happy.

473
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:13,480
<i>Of a life you're living...</i>

474
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:16,399
I don't wanna deal with this.

475
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,150
I don't wanna deal with it either.

476
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:20,444
<i>Something you take...</i>

477
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,739
Let's just enjoy being together.

478
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,157
Okay.

479
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,367
- Okay.
- Okay.

480
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,286
<i>Round and around and around...</i>

481
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,996
We will have to eventually.

482
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,331
<i>We go...</i>

483
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:35,293
Not today.

484
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:39,673
<i>Tell me now, tell me now
Tell me now, you know</i>

485
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,801
Hey. Sorry, I'm a little early.

486
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:46,763
Oh. No problem. Please sit.

487
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,143
You know, after that conversation
we had the other day,

488
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:52,936
I had some clarity.

489
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,437
Great. Great.

490
00:21:54,438 --> 00:22:00,736
And I felt like what we really need
is a new guy in my place ASAP.

491
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:02,945
Wow.

492
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:03,988
Okay.

493
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,240
Sorry to interrupt.

494
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,327
Oh man, is it...

495
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:12,079
Is it happening right now?
I'm so sorry. Apologies.

496
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,456
Is what happening?

497
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:14,374
Uh...

498
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:18,170
These things are not supposed
to unfold this way. Please.

499
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,380
- Rabbi Noah Roklov, meet Rabbi Noah Field.
- Hi.

500
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:22,631
Nice to meet you.

501
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,593
He's Temple Chai's new senior rabbi.

502
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,180
I'm sorry.

503
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:30,140
Wait.

504
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:32,058
Did I just get passed over?

505
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:35,061
No offense, Noah,
but one day your girl's converting,

506
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,937
the next day she's not converting.

507
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:41,025
Who the hell knows?
I think people just wanted a... safer bet.

508
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:44,612
Excuse me, how do you even... Wait.
We talked about my timeline dilemma.

509
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:47,156
We agreed to put a pin in it.
I don't even understand.

510
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:51,285
- There's a whole process with the board.
- Noah is someone with a lot of buzz.

511
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:53,412
We've been eyeing him
since his sermon went viral.

512
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,414
- This is a competitive situation.
- Went viral?

513
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:57,334
We have to act fast.

514
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,211
My socials are on fire.

515
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,546
It was <i>Hot Ones.</i>
That's what really did it for me.

516
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:07,009
Noah, you will always be
an important part of Temple Chai.

517
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,844
But we can't have a whole congregation

518
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:12,057
waiting to see
if your girlfriend is going to convert.

519
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:16,812
I...

520
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,191
I need to change my lunch order.

521
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:26,113
- You two get to know each other.
- Thank you, Rabbi.

522
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:29,783
You don't remember me, huh?

523
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:32,535
We don't know each other.

524
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:35,204
We had two summers of crossover
at Camp Haverim.

525
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:36,163
You don't remember?

526
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:38,165
I was color war captain,
two years running.

527
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,126
Blue team.

528
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:43,504
Everyone called me Big Noah,
and they called you Little...

529
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:44,548
Okay.

530
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,217
I kind of remember you. I...

531
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,302
I didn't recognize you.

532
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:52,763
For the record, I think
only two people called me that,

533
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,348
and you tried to make it stick.

534
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:57,059
- Sorry, I didn't mean to trigger you.
- I'm not triggered.

535
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,561
'Cause you seem a little worked up.

536
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:01,605
Actually, I think I'm being very calm,
given the situation.

537
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,941
- Likewise. That's very nice to hear.
- Rabbi Noah?

538
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:04,985
- Yeah?
- Yeah?

539
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:13,076
<i>If it's easier to be</i>

540
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,036
<i>Alone than be with me...</i>

541
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:17,122
How'd it go?

542
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:20,250
<i>I love you just the same</i>

543
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:22,377
<i>It's fine</i>

544
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:26,089
<i>No, don't cry</i>

545
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,468
<i>I'm still on your side</i>

546
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,846
<i>I'll piece myself together</i>

547
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:38,350
<i>When I fall apart</i>

548
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:44,858
<i>Homesick, with nowhere to go</i>

549
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:52,449
<i>Can't kick this feeling
Everything that I miss</i>

550
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:59,456
<i>And I will love you wherever you go</i>

551
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,875
<i>I know</i>

552
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:06,463
<i>Leaving wasn't easy</i>
