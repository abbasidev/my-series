1
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:09,884
<i>Got that real big energy</i>

2
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:15,098
<i>- Got that real big energy
- Hey, when you gonna stop playing?</i>

3
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,558
<i>Bad chick, I could be your fantasy</i>

4
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,977
<i>I can tell you got big, big energy</i>

5
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:21,979
<i>Ain't too many of 'em
That can handle me</i>

6
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,314
<i>But I might let you try it
After Hennessy</i>

7
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:26,608
<i>Make 'em sing to this thing
Like a melody</i>

8
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:28,986
<i>And if your girl ain't right
I got the remedy</i>

9
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:31,405
<i>Ain't too many of 'em
That can handle me</i>

10
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:32,448
<i>Bad chick, I could...</i>

11
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:34,909
I mean, are we just, like,
not gonna talk about this?

12
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,078
Talk about what?

13
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:38,829
You got bangs.

14
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,497
Like, what happened?

15
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:42,458
That's, like, a major life transition.

16
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:45,544
I think I feel good about them.
Should I... Should I not?

17
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,296
No, honey. No, they're great.

18
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,631
- They're great.
- Okay. Great. Okay.

19
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:51,467
- Amazing. I love 'em.
- I just meant...

20
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,427
It's like, what's behind the curtain,
you know?

21
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:55,596
It's just... Shh.
A sexy little secret. Yeah.

22
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:56,930
- Don't touch 'em.
- Okay.

23
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:59,349
I, too, actually have
a sexy little secret.

24
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:03,021
Uh, I didn't get bangs, but today,
I got my first rabbi gig post-Temple Chai.

25
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,106
- Oh shit!
- <i>Mazel tov,</i> Noah!

26
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:08,901
It's a <i>brit bat,</i> uh, aka a baby-naming.

27
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,695
That's so cute.
You're like a concierge rabbi.

28
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:14,532
Very chic. Is it like a Jewish baptism?

29
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:18,077
Uh, it's a ritual where Jewish parents
reveal the name of their child

30
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,203
and its significance.

31
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,245
Can I come?

32
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,456
Are girlfriends of the rabbi allowed?

33
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:23,583
You wanna come?

34
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:27,461
Yeah. For one, I'd like to see you cute
and in charge, and number two,

35
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:31,423
I'm on a mission to learn more about
Judaism, in case you haven't noticed.

36
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,509
Yeah. Let me talk to the family,
but I love it.

37
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,676
- Great!
- Wait, Noah.

38
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:36,011
Wait, Noah, who is the family?

39
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:39,432
Uh, this couple the Litmans know,
Abby and Gabe Kaplan.

40
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,143
Abby Loves Smoothies, Abby Kaplan?

41
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,229
I... I... Maybe. Do you know her?

42
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,688
I went to middle school with her.

43
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:49,024
I'm obsessed with how much I hate her.

44
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:51,902
Well, I mean, she's an influencer,
so she's always, like,

45
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,487
"I'm here at my kid's birthday party,"

46
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:56,866
or, "Look at my house,"
or, "I love my husband."

47
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,035
So she loves her family.

48
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:00,911
Like, too much.

49
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:04,915
But the real reason I hate her is because,
when we were in middle school,

50
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:07,668
we had a sleepover, and she tried
to get everyone to go to bed early.

51
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,170
I was, like, "No,"
so while we were watching a movie,

52
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:15,092
she snuck upstairs and cut the hair
of my Felicity American Girl doll.

53
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,635
- Whoa.
- That's it?

54
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,053
She should be in jail.

55
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,972
- And she denied it.
- Oh.

56
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,640
- Is that her?
- Yep.

57
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,809
Oh God, these sconces are beautiful.

58
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,436
Listen, uh, if you hate her,
I don't think you should come

59
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:28,397
just 'cause I need
to make a great impression.

60
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,816
No, I'll be fine. I'll be nice. I promise.

61
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,944
Yes, Felicity-gate was, like,
a million years ago,

62
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:36,196
and this is your first job
outside the temple.

63
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:37,531
I really wanna support you.

64
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:38,490
Okay?

65
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,950
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

66
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:43,413
And if I get to judge her home decor
in the process, so be it, you know?

67
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,378
- Excuse me? Can I...
- Hold on, one second.

68
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,840
- One second, lady.
- Been waiting here for, like, an hour.

69
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,302
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

70
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:58,719
Yeah, why?

71
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,055
Well, you got bangs.
You have to be at least a little unstable.

72
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:04,350
Fine. Okay.

73
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,312
- But just don't say anything to Noah.
- I won't.

74
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:10,731
Oh God. I think I might be pregnant.

75
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:13,151
Oh my God. Wow. Oh.

76
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:17,780
- I didn't even know you guys were trying.
- Oh, no, we're not. I mean, Sasha is.

77
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:22,492
I just thought we were done after Miri.
She's still my little baby.

78
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:23,994
My baby with an attitude problem.

79
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:27,164
But now Sasha's all excited
about having another one,

80
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,292
and I'm, like, I don't
even... I don't know.

81
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:32,628
When was the last time you had bangs?

82
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:36,548
2004. I was dating a guy
who said he liked my strong forehead.

83
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:40,011
Okay. That's like calling
a bikini pic brave. Mm-mm.

84
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:41,637
Gin and tonic?

85
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,556
Um, are you sure?

86
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,391
Oh my God.

87
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,440
Hey. What are you doing?

88
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:56,485
Stalking Abby Loves Smoothies'
many maternity shoots.

89
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,862
Is it safe to be pregnant on a horse?

90
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:02,574
Wait, are you talking about
Abby fucking Kaplan? God, why?

91
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,577
Noah's taking me to name her baby.
It's like a rabbi thing.

92
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:09,373
Name it something dumb. I'm still pissed
Mom blamed me for cutting Felicity's hair.

93
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:12,627
Why didn't she just apologize for that?
Maybe we still could have been friends.

94
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:15,128
Now she's posing in a field, pregnant.

95
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,089
Mm.

96
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:17,798
Is there a flower crown?

97
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,717
- There's obviously a flower crown.
- Yeah.

98
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:26,056
Noah will make such a good dad.

99
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:29,309
He'd be, like, one of those guys
who puts their kids on their shoulders

100
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,352
to watch the fireworks.

101
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,396
Ugh. I can never see over those people.

102
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,189
Have you talked about the kid thing yet?

103
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,816
We both want them.

104
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,277
He even used the words
"our kids" on Valentine's Day.

105
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,696
Right, but has he actually
talked about it with you?

106
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,573
Because, like,
these would be rabbi's kids.

107
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:48,120
What's that like, you know? No bacon,
no Santa. Like, praying for fun?

108
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,789
Well, we haven't gotten that far.

109
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,416
Oh my God, no Santa?

110
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,334
- Mm-hmm.
- I didn't think about that.

111
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:57,087
I guess the kids and I
will have to live with you every December.

112
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,048
No. No, I don't like kids.

113
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:11,018
Okay, run me through
the quick highlights of this thing?

114
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,937
- What do you wanna know?
- Anything. I'm baby-naming curious.

115
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:14,897
Okay.

116
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:20,153
Well, as Ashkenazi Jews, we traditionally
name a baby after a relative who's died.

117
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:24,072
Oh. Wait, you can't choose
your own baby name?

118
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:27,660
No, no, no, you can.
There are just some parameters involved.

119
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,704
For instance, uh,
my <i>deda's</i> name was Alexander,

120
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:33,373
so I always planned on naming
my future child Alexander.

121
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,960
But I could also choose a name
that starts with an A.

122
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:37,711
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

123
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:41,423
Um, obviously,
light and love to Alexander.

124
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:44,926
Um, in theory,
I'm not really into honoring people.

125
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:46,678
Like, I never even met your grandpa.

126
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,847
Oh wow, look at that.

127
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,183
This whole thing is not my vibe.

128
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,644
I can, like, smell the candles
from out here.

129
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,270
We don't like candles?

130
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,314
No, it's not just the candles, Noah.

131
00:05:57,315 --> 00:06:01,068
It's, like, the house,
the boring, expensive furniture,

132
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,362
the going to children's birthday parties
all weekend.

133
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,574
I just don't want any of this.

134
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,534
Any of this?

135
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,413
Or any of this?

136
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,248
Come on.

137
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,626
Stop.

138
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:19,295
- Hi.
- Hey.

139
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:26,219
- I'm glad you're here.
- Me too.

140
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:28,554
Joanne?

141
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:31,932
Abby Kaplan!

142
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:35,102
- Oh, hi.
- Come here. Oh, JoJo!

143
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:38,897
Oh, come here. Don't let go.
Good to see you.

144
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,149
Welcome to Tarzana.

145
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,819
Hi, Rabbi Roklov.
So nice to finally meet you.

146
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,406
Hi. Yeah, you too. I can't believe
that Joanne is your girlfriend.

147
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,741
We were, like, total LYLAS in sixth grade.

148
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:50,867
- Crazy, right?
- LY...

149
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:52,160
Love You Like A Sister.

150
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,453
- Oh.
- Yeah.

151
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:54,913
- Hey.
- Oh my God.

152
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:58,626
You should text Morgan. Tell her to come.
I don't know why we stopped hanging out.

153
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:01,378
- Really? You don't remember?
- No.

154
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:04,047
It was, like,
a million years ago, forever.

155
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:06,299
But it's so fun you're here now.

156
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,260
Ooh.

157
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:11,179
Do you mind taking off your heels?
Just for the floors.

158
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,182
Oh, I would, but they really
complete my outfit, so...

159
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,143
Sorry.

160
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:16,893
Um...

161
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:19,354
- Take the heels off.
- What? You're...

162
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,815
Well, she's wearing heels.
You're wearing heels.

163
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:24,652
These are my house wedges.
I've never worn them outside.

164
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,403
If you don't mind.

165
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,446
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

166
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,738
No, absolutely.

167
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,824
- No problem. Of course.
- She doesn't mind.

168
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,451
- No, I'm good.
- I hate to ask.

169
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,743
It's not a big deal.

170
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:36,164
Oh my God. Oh, cute socks!

171
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,623
I forgot how short you are!

172
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:41,543
Just like the sixth grade. Cute.

173
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:42,711
Oh.

174
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,546
So where's the rest of your family?

175
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,673
Oh. Gabe? Gabe?

176
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,884
- Yep.
- Get over here, babe!

177
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,261
- This is my husband, Gabe.
- Hi. Rabbi Roklov.

178
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,054
- Hi. Joanne.
- Nice to meet you.

179
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,097
And who is this?

180
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:56,099
This is our three-year-old, Jesse Charles.

181
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,392
- Yeah.
- Say, "Hi."

182
00:07:57,393 --> 00:08:00,812
- Can you say, "Hi"?
- Can you say, "Hi, Rabbi?"

183
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:04,024
You know, he caught the tail end
of <i>Apocalypse Now</i> with me last night.

184
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:07,152
- I think he's just a little bit rattled.
- We won't do that again.

185
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,739
And today's little star
is upstairs napping, so...

186
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,325
- Yes.
- Baby Afternoon.

187
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,159
And what's her name?

188
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,118
Afternoon.

189
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:17,287
That's not a...

190
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,915
That's... is my favorite time of day.
That's great.

191
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,709
That is absolutely
because you've just had lunch,

192
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,169
or you can either take a nap

193
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,505
or get your work done.
The day is sort of yours.

194
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,923
- Lovely name.
- Thank you.

195
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,467
I wish I could take credit,
but that's all this one.

196
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,135
Perfect. Wow.

197
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:34,971
Her naming style is whimsical, cozy.

198
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:38,350
Yeah. And we wanted to go with
an A name for my grandma, Aliza.

199
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,267
You know.

200
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:41,437
Yeah, I'm... Well, I'm starting to.

201
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:42,854
We'll be right back.

202
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,356
- Okay.
- Gonna get something to eat.

203
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,315
Enjoy the spread!

204
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,108
There's a lot of treats. There's, uh...

205
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:49,027
- Do you like meringues?
- Yeah.

206
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,696
- Absolutely.
- There's a ton.

207
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,656
All right. Let's go, buddy.

208
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:56,326
I should've studied harder for
the ceremony. Didn't know they had a son.

209
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:59,955
You know what? She gets to wear heels.
I'm walking around in mismatched socks.

210
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,748
The whole power dynamic is off, Noah.

211
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,834
- What happened to LYLAS?
- Fuck LYLAS.

212
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,419
Does this house look smaller in person?

213
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,421
Listen. I know you're upset
about the Barbie doll.

214
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:11,591
- Felicity was an American Girl.
- I understand.

215
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:13,843
Okay? And sure, she wasn't
one of the original three,

216
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:16,846
and I wasn't really even into her,
like, wartime energy,

217
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:19,224
but she was spunky,
and she was mine, Noah.

218
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:22,270
Understood.
I really need today to go well.

219
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,731
Okay. I'm sorry.

220
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,233
- I got you.
- Thank you.

221
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,443
Rabbi, I want you to meet my <i>zeyde.</i>

222
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:32,070
Great. Great.

223
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,363
Okay. Thank you.

224
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:37,242
I usually know the entire family at these.
I've been at their weddings and funerals.

225
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,035
It's weird not having a congregation.

226
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:41,079
Hey. It's gonna be great.

227
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,416
You're gonna be great.
None of us even deserve you.

228
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,006
- Lovely to meet you. I'm Rabbi Roklov.
- How are you?

229
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,717
What a pleasure.
Congratulations on the big day.

230
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,469
I just met your grandson.

231
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,805
Oh.

232
00:09:58,347 --> 00:09:59,180
What?

233
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:02,976
Hey, Holistic Mamas.
Wait. What are you eating?

234
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:06,813
It's actually so cute. So Dr. Andy
remembers all the snacks that I love,

235
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:09,024
and he, like,
hides them for me to find later.

236
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,650
I need you to focus right now

237
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:13,528
because I am in
Abby Loves Smoothies' bathroom.

238
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:16,448
- Incredible lighting. It's just...
- <i>I know.</i>

239
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,200
And I met her husband,
and I have questions.

240
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,535
<i>Mm, gay.</i>

241
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:21,745
Weirdly, no.

242
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,955
But I keep trying
to figure out if he's, like,

243
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:27,042
one of those Instagram husbands
who's been trained to take good pictures

244
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:30,378
and is really proud of them,
or if he's dying inside and he hates her.

245
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:31,880
Oh, no. He is fully dead.

246
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,507
<i>- Those photos aren't even good.</i>
- What are you doing right now?

247
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,217
Abby told me to invite you.

248
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,886
<i>Oh my God. No fucking way.</i>

249
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,055
<i>Mom grounded me for a month
for her bullshit.</i>

250
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:43,475
She still says she has no idea
why we stopped hanging out.

251
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,434
She won't admit it.

252
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,519
- She literally said that?
- <i>Uh-huh.</i>

253
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,274
You know what? Text me her address, okay?
Only a bitch messes with hair. Let's go.

254
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,363
Here we go.

255
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:15,924
Hi. You know, I would love to hear
some more about your grandmother, Aliza,

256
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:19,552
and some of her great qualities
you'd like to bless your baby with today.

257
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:21,846
Do you mind if I shoot
some pre-ceremony content?

258
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,058
- Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course.
- Okay. Come here.

259
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,226
And we're live.

260
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:29,813
Hi, guys. This is Rabbi Roklov.
Isn't he cute?

261
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:33,525
Okay, so today
we're at baby Afternoon's naming ceremony,

262
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,653
and she's so excited and a little nervous.

263
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,446
I'm kidding. She's a baby.

264
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:42,200
So a lot of you have been asking
what dress we went with for the ceremony,

265
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:45,328
and I have to say
I'm pretty surprised by the poll I posted.

266
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:47,747
73% of you said the green dress.

267
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,207
Bleurgh!

268
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,584
Boo!

269
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:52,670
Bye!

270
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,630
Amazing. Do you mind taking my photo?

271
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:57,549
Sure. Is there one sweet memory

272
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,387
you have of your grandma
that you're reminded of today?

273
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,263
I don't know.

274
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,932
She had a secret girlfriend.
Can you do sideways?

275
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,268
Sure, sure, sure.

276
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,105
- Turn it.
- Oh, duh. I'm sorry.

277
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,231
- Gabe!
- Yeah?

278
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,150
Come over here! We're shooting!

279
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,609
Coming in hot. Here I come.

280
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,696
- This is Gabe, remember?
- Yes, of course.

281
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:20,613
Got it.

282
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:23,241
- I can tell this isn't working.
- I thought it was good.

283
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,159
No. It's no good.

284
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,703
It was just the angling down
didn't happen, but that's okay.

285
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,371
- No, I feel...
- Thank you so much.

286
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:30,123
- You tried. It's great!
- Your best.

287
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,040
They're good.

288
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,751
- Better light here.
- Didn't know.

289
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:33,668
Hey.

290
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,086
Cute photo shoot.

291
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,755
She's pretty. I'll give her that.

292
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,382
Not my type.

293
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,138
- Hey.
- You really invited her?

294
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:45,847
Abby told me to.

295
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,849
Hi.<i>Shalom.</i>

296
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,770
Well, this is a sick birthday party.

297
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,354
Oh man. Okay.

298
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,523
The ceremony's about to start.
Please be good.

299
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:56,816
Yes, Dad.

300
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,402
We will. We promise.

301
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,570
- Bye.
- Thank you, thank you.

302
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,197
Okay. Where's the smoothie fucker?

303
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,158
Making content, I'm sure. Outside.

304
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:08,662
Oh my God. Shit. She's so hot.
I thought that was a filter.

305
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,623
- That's depressing.
- Yeah.

306
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,334
This isn't gonna be fun anymore.

307
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,463
Meh. No, no, no.

308
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:19,673
Ugh.

309
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,091
Morgan, you can't do that.

310
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,384
What? They're too soft.

311
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:24,511
Morgan?

312
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,012
Oh, what's up?

313
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,180
Hi.

314
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:30,600
I just had to stop by to celebrate
your little nugget when Joanne told me.

315
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:33,728
Wow, that is just so sweet.
Thank you for coming.

316
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:37,106
I'm really glad you're here and that
we are getting a chance to catch up.

317
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:38,566
I... I missed you guys.

318
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:42,695
We used to be so close until...
I don't even remember when.

319
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:45,114
- Mm.
- Sixth grade. June 23rd.

320
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:46,407
My end-of-year party.

321
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:49,160
Wow. That is oddly specific.

322
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,954
But yeah, maybe sometime around then.

323
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:54,582
Come on. I mean, now that we're adults,
you can admit it. You know, it's funny.

324
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,918
You're the one who cut off
Felicity's hair, right?

325
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,128
Felicity?

326
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,296
What... I... Was she in our grade?

327
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:04,050
She's a plucky little redhead who survived
the goddamn Revolutionary War.

328
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,511
I have no idea
what you guys are talking about.

329
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,054
- Oh my God.
- Okay.

330
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:11,975
Um, I was trying to be nice,
but it's starting to be unhinged

331
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,144
that you won't actually just admit
that it was you.

332
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,230
My American Girl doll?

333
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,525
Okay.

334
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,485
You guys are funny. Enjoy the grapes.

335
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:23,403
Mm-hmm.

336
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:26,322
- Okay.
- God, she's still such a fucking liar.

337
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:29,367
We should go and cut off her baby's hair.

338
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,494
Yeah. I bet she wouldn't
post that on Instagram.

339
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:33,788
I swiped up,
and I bought her smoothie powder,

340
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,874
and I swear it gave me bed bugs
the next day.

341
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,792
- Mm.
- Coincidence?

342
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,294
Maybe yes, maybe no. You tell me.

343
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:42,673
It's yes, for sure, 'cause I keep telling
you to wash your sheets more often.

344
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:48,553
Hey, honey? I promise
I'm not trying to do bathroom talk,

345
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,805
but you've been in there for a while.
Is everything okay?

346
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:54,393
Yeah. Good. Yeah, co...
Yeah, I'm good. Come in.

347
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,146
Hey.

348
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,149
I am not pregnant.

349
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,068
Oh.

350
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:07,031
Don't we do the testing part together?
You did it without me.

351
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,700
Yeah, sorry. Sorry.

352
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,454
Oh.

353
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,337
Yeah, babe, I don't wanna keep trying.

354
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:26,300
Like, right now, or

355
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,010
ever?

356
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,470
Ever.

357
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,391
Well, shit.

358
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:38,353
What are you? Are...
Right now, are you sad?

359
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,647
Are you disappointed?
Are you angry? Are there...

360
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:46,028
I think maybe
I'm all of those things, and...

361
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,824
maybe a little bit shocked,
but I can adjust.

362
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,535
So what do we do now?

363
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:03,003
Just, like, live?

364
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,172
Live, okay.

365
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,591
No, I can do that.

366
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,513
I can't believe I got fucking bangs.

367
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,350
You put me in a real tough spot,
having to say they look great.

368
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,611
- Amen.
- Amen.

369
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:31,197
Today, Abby and Abe are...

370
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,866
- Gabe.
- With a "guh.'

371
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:37,037
Gabe. Of course. Sorry.

372
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:42,001
I don't like to mess up as a rabbi.
Thank goodness it wasn't a <i>bris.</i>

373
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,796
Um, Gabe.

374
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,342
Abby and Gabe
have chosen the name Afternoon

375
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:55,472
and Aliza as their daughter's Hebrew name.

376
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,600
In Hebrew, the name Aliza means joyful,

377
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:02,645
so that is my hope for Afternoon,
and for all of us.

378
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:06,400
Is to bravely seek out joy,
even when it's hard.

379
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,235
Even when it feels like
there's no obvious solution.

380
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:12,321
Because so many miracles had to happen

381
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:16,744
for these two people to find each other
and decide to make a family.

382
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:21,998
Giving her the name Aliza
is to hope for her to enjoy life.

383
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,459
And how simple is that?

384
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:28,213
Because if we can find joy in the mundane,
in the imperfect,

385
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,007
then we live our lives as if we're lucky,

386
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,342
regardless of what luck comes our way.

387
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:34,594
That's beautiful.

388
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:35,637
So,

389
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:39,390
please join me in welcoming

390
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,727
Afternoon Aliza...

391
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,732
as our newest member of the tribe.

392
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,191
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

393
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,609
<i>Mazel tov!</i>

394
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,695
- Let's go look around.
- Wait, what if they do the chair lifting?

395
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:55,032
- I really like the chair lifting.
- Just stop.

396
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,117
Okay. Give her back.

397
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:00,204
Can you say, "Thank you, Rabbi?"

398
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:03,664
- Say, "Thank you, Rabbi."
- It was my pleasure. It was my pleasure.

399
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,793
- Say, "Rabbi."
- She said it with her eyes.

400
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,545
- Oh my God, this dress is so sticky.
- Can you tiptoe, please?

401
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:10,881
Okay, let's see.

402
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:16,386
It's like a Joni-Mitchell-themed room.
It's very weird. Come on.

403
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,097
<i>Yasher koach</i>, Rabbi.

404
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,765
Oh, sorry about that.

405
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,058
It's okay. Gabe.

406
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,060
- Yes, yes.
- I'm just fucking with you.

407
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,019
No, no.

408
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,773
Hey, full disclosure.
I normally completely zone out.

409
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,984
There was a <i>Shabbat</i> where I fell asleep,
woke up, everyone just gone.

410
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:36,405
Yeah, but everything, the hope and all
the shit you were saying about mundane,

411
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:37,615
was fucking unbelievable.

412
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,784
- Wow, thank you.
- Yes.

413
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,660
- Ooh.
- We shouldn't be in here.

414
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,537
I'm starting to get jealous of her baby.

415
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:46,290
- I gotta do it.
- What? Are you using her baby's products?

416
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,626
Yes.

417
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,877
What? Come on!

418
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:53,339
Abby Loves Smoothies is annoying.
We came here to mess with her, didn't we?

419
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,802
No. I came here to support Noah.

420
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,930
Okay, sure. There was a small part of me
that wanted to mess with her,

421
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,473
but that was, like, hours ago.

422
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,268
Oh, okay. Well, I don't know
what changed for you,

423
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,603
but Abby Loves Smoothies
has always been annoying.

424
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:09,021
I need you to remember that.

425
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:11,691
Remember how her parents
used to wait outside school for her,

426
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,819
and they, like, held hands?

427
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:15,320
Yeah.

428
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,865
But I think the most annoying part
about her is that she just...

429
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,825
She had a better childhood than we did,

430
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,870
and now she's got her big house
and stupid family and swipe-ups,

431
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,956
and I know that those are
great reasons to hate somebody...

432
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:30,586
Joanne, she cut off your doll's hair.
Okay? Have a fucking spine.

433
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,714
Maybe I just don't care about it anymore.

434
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:39,178
I don't know. The thrill of revenge
isn't hitting the same way.

435
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,220
I guess I'm mature.

436
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:44,182
My temple is actually
looking for a new rabbi.

437
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:48,478
Sure. You guys... You, uh...
You have any leads? Have anyone in mind?

438
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,521
Well, we do now.

439
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,439
Yeah?

440
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,357
Mm-hmm.

441
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,485
- We're talking about me?
- He's so humble.

442
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:57,862
Oh, okay. Am-Amazing.

443
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,656
I'll set something up.
You can come and meet everybody...

444
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,325
- Sorry, one second.
- Yep.

445
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,993
- I gotta take this, actually.
- Sure.

446
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:06,370
Hey, motherfucker.
I got my kid's thing till 3:00.

447
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,664
- I'm mature too.
- Morgan.

448
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:11,084
- I am mature. Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

449
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:16,005
Do you guys need something? I was
hoping to keep people out of here.

450
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,465
We had to pee.

451
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:20,135
- Yeah.
- And then we got lost.

452
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,431
Are you wearing boots in the nursery?

453
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:26,974
No.

454
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:29,102
I can see you're wearing boots.

455
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,146
Okay.

456
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:35,234
You guys can make fun of me all you want,

457
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:39,237
but posting about my life
is how I make money for my family.

458
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,489
It let Gabe quit the towel industry

459
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,034
and me spend more time with my mom
before she died.

460
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:45,826
I can handle the judgment.

461
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:48,996
Oh. We weren't making fun of you
for being an influencer.

462
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:53,919
We were making fun of you for being happy,
and that's on us.

463
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:58,714
I really didn't know what you guys were
talking about with the whole doll thing,

464
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,926
and then after you said it, I realized.

465
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:04,971
I did cut your doll's hair, okay?

466
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:08,099
I... I'm mortified, but I was, like, 11.

467
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,894
I was so tired.
You guys wouldn't let me go to sleep!

468
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:12,813
But I'm sorry.

469
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,355
So psycho.

470
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,233
- It really was.
- We were just kids.

471
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:20,070
Anyway, someone gifted my daughter
one of those dolls.

472
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,364
It's not the same girl,
but I owe you a doll.

473
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,951
- Oh God, no. That's crazy.
- We'll take it. Thank you.

474
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,495
She's all yours. Okay.

475
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:34,501
You know, it really sucks that
you guys hate me because the truth is...

476
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:38,463
this is so embarrassing, but I

477
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:41,841
love your podcast.
I listen to you guys, like, every week.

478
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,885
It's why I hired your rabbi boyfriend.

479
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,847
I tell people, "I grew up with them."

480
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:48,889
Oh fuck.

481
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,767
- No, Abby, we don't hate you.
- Do you want to come on the pod?

482
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:55,022
No. No. Nobody wants to hear
what I have to say.

483
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:57,983
Or do you think... Do you think they would?

484
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,736
- I am building an empire.
- Maybe.

485
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:04,448
No, it's okay. You know what?
Let me just stay a fan.

486
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,617
I'll reach out if I change my mind.

487
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,579
It was really good seeing you.

488
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,831
Can you get out of this room, please?

489
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,419
Oh my God. Why didn't you tell me
my Spanx had been showing this whole time?

490
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,671
- Through that whole talk?
- I need to find Noah.

491
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,631
Okay.

492
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:24,592
Appreciate you
holding down the fort with me.

493
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,302
Sort of avoiding my father-in-law.

494
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:29,680
I gave him some sketchy investment advice.
Oh, yeah.

495
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:30,598
Good luck.

496
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,891
There you go, enjoy.

497
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,059
- Hey.
- Hi.

498
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,897
I was looking for you.
So, first baby naming.

499
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:40,941
- Give it to me.
- Oh, you named the shit out of that baby.

500
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:42,401
- That's the right answer.
- Yeah.

501
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:43,652
That's the right answer.

502
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:44,612
Um, sit down.

503
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:45,530
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

504
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,409
I'm sorry about earlier.

505
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:53,371
I should have been way more focused
on the baby naming than on Abby.

506
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,330
No, no, it's fine.

507
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:58,626
But I realized something while I was
maybe gonna cut Abby's baby's hair.

508
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,337
- What now? Okay.
- Noah, focus.

509
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,757
I spent my whole life

510
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:06,093
not wanting to be an adult.

511
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,345
Until now.

512
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,014
The truth is,

513
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:14,058
I want to pick out sconces.

514
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:17,061
I want to obsess over my kids, too,

515
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,188
just in, like, a less annoying way.

516
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:24,194
All these things that I had disdain for,
I actually want.

517
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:28,280
I used to think
I was so antiestablishment,

518
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:31,117
but as it turns out, I'm establishment.

519
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,369
<i>Be strong as steel...</i>

520
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,287
Prove it.

521
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:36,163
<i>How you feel...</i>

522
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:38,125
I want couple's stationery.

523
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,377
When you get invited on a boys' trip,

524
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:43,796
I want you to say,
"I gotta check with the boss."

525
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:45,756
Of course I gotta check with the boss.

526
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,716
And of course the answer's gonna be no.

527
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:50,053
<i>Need saving</i>

528
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:52,888
<i>All I'm saying is...</i>

529
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:55,057
I want all those things with you too.

530
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:58,352
<i>If your head's under water</i>

531
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:00,730
<i>I'll be your float</i>

532
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:05,359
<i>If you're feeling lost
I'll be your north star...</i>

533
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,362
- What about matching outfits?
- Oh, don't push your luck.

534
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:12,533
<i>Two, I'll piece you back together</i>

535
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:15,870
<i>Whatever you need, baby</i>

536
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,873
<i>That's what I'll be</i>

537
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,379
<i>Don't matter when or where</i>

538
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,382
<i>Oh, I'll be there</i>

539
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:32,387
<i>If you're hurting, baby, I'm hurting</i>

540
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:36,390
<i>Don't try to push me away</i>

541
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:38,893
<i>By your side, that's where I'll stay</i>

542
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:45,400
<i>When everything else just ain't
One thing's for certain</i>

543
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:49,488
<i>If your head's under water</i>

544
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,990
<i>I'll be your float</i>

545
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:57,828
<i>If you're feeling lost
I'll be your north star home</i>

546
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:03,918
<i>If your heart's broke in two
I'll piece you back together</i>

547
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:09,925
<i>Whatever you need, baby
That's what I'll be</i>

548
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,801
<i>Oh</i>

549
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:16,932
<i>That's what I'll be</i>
