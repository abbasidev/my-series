1
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,849
Amen.

2
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,018
Good <i>Shabbas.</i>

3
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,019
Esther.

4
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,145
Good <i>Shabbas.</i>

5
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:22,229
Everybody have?

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,690
I love how shiny this bread is.

7
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:25,607
<i>Challah.</i>

8
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:27,360
<i>Challah!</i>

9
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:30,071
Yes.

10
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:34,783
No, no, Joanne, Joanne, Joanne.
That is where Sasha sits.

11
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:37,203
You are sitting on Noah's other side.

12
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,497
- Sorry.
- What am I doing?

13
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:41,958
Oh. Thank you, m'lady.

14
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,337
Your mom is really strict about seating.

15
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:48,673
- You'll get used to it.
- Okay.

16
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:51,341
- Can I have the soup?
- Oh yeah, soup.

17
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:54,386
I like you being at <i>Shabbat.</i>
It's my favorite time of the week.

18
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:57,806
I still think it's crazy you have dinner
with your family every Friday.

19
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:59,975
Some people would say this is a lot.

20
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:01,518
Well, family's important to me.

21
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:03,729
Noah, family is important to me too.

22
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,774
We all share a Costco card.

23
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,526
Joanne.

24
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,736
No phones at the table, please.

25
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:15,115
Sorry. Morgan was just texting my mom
happy birthday on our group chat.

26
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:17,326
Group chat?
On your mother's birthday? A text?

27
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,911
- That's it?
- Well...

28
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,120
It's Lynn's birthday?

29
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:23,415
Mother waits a whole day for the phone
to ring? Day's almost over, six o'clock.

30
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,417
- Do you both hate your mother?
- No.

31
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,920
I would kill
to just be left alone on my birthday.

32
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:31,381
- I didn't know. I didn't call her.
- Stop. It's not. Miscommunication.

33
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:33,842
Her birthday is the 8th.
Morgan thinks it's the 6th.

34
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:36,136
We've told her a zillion times.
It just doesn't stick.

35
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:38,263
- Okay. Huh.
- Today's the 6th.

36
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,015
- Correct.
- And her birthday is today?

37
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:42,143
- The 8th.
- Thank God I didn't miss it. Okay.

38
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:43,853
Okay.

39
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:45,396
Uh, what's the plan?

40
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,566
- What are we doing?
- Mm.

41
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:50,610
Um...

42
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,237
I will call her.

43
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,280
Oh.

44
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:57,574
Saddest story ever told.
Can I have a pickle, please?

45
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,868
You don't do anything together? Nothing?

46
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:01,411
Not even a cake? Little candles?

47
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:03,497
Maybe a restaurant reservation? Please.

48
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,666
Balloon bouquet or an edible arrangement?

49
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,584
Don't you have any family traditions?

50
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:08,836
Yes.

51
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:11,296
We have family traditions.

52
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:14,259
- We just don't do them.
- Mm.

53
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:17,010
Um...

54
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:21,390
Well, when I was little, my mom used to
get takeout for our birthday breakfast

55
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,016
and then get donuts instead of a cake.

56
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,226
- Oh.
- Oh.

57
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,854
- Sorry. That sounds hard.
- No, sounds good. Donuts are great.

58
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,480
Okay, so let's do that.

59
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:32,609
Oh, mm, I don't...
I don't think my family's really the type.

60
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,112
Come on. You're joining my family
for our traditions.

61
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,323
I wanna be part of that stuff
with your family too.

62
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:42,244
Please. Listen. It'll be
really fun. I'll plan the whole thing.

63
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,328
Text at six o'clock.

64
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,414
It's okay, Dad.

65
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:46,833
- Today's not her mom's birthday.
- Still.

66
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,458
We have 48 hours.

67
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:50,587
The 8th. Oh, the 8th.

68
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:55,174
Wait, so why are you making Mom
celebrate her birthday with us?

69
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,967
- Is she sick?
- No, she's fine.

70
00:02:56,968 --> 00:03:00,012
I just think it would be nice
to circle back to family traditions.

71
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,555
It's important to Mom.

72
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:04,183
We both know Mom would
rather do her rituals with Goldie,

73
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,852
where they eat chocolate mushrooms
and cry outside.

74
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,479
Okay, fine. It means a lot to Noah, okay?

75
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,901
It was his idea, and family traditions
are weirdly important to him.

76
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:17,279
So you wanna impress Noah by doing
something we haven't done in 20 years?

77
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,408
Of course you don't get it. Okay.
I am in a mature adult partnership.

78
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:24,578
Noah and I are figuring out
how to be a "we."

79
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,872
And it's like a silent negotiation.

80
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:27,790
Ew.

81
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,459
- Hi.
- Hey.

82
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,628
I'm working on my toast for Lynn tomorrow.

83
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,548
How long is yours gonna be?
'Cause it's weird if mine's longer.

84
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:38,717
- Um...
- No, we don't do toasts. Mm-mm.

85
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,094
Toasts are for people
who have nice things to say.

86
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:43,222
Got it. Okay. Hey, here.

87
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,099
Can't just drink coffee all day.

88
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:48,477
Babe. Tracking my water intake?

89
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,562
- Mm.
- God, that's so sweet.

90
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:51,855
Morgan, did you hear that?

91
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:54,566
Yeah. Don't you have, like,
a job to go to or something?

92
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,861
Yeah, things are just
a little bit slow right now.

93
00:03:57,862 --> 00:04:00,697
People are interested
in working with Big Noah.

94
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:03,158
Knocking on my door a little bit less.

95
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,993
I think he peaked at his first sermon.

96
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:07,913
Oh my gosh. He actually got
the cover of <i>Jewish Journal,</i>

97
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:11,166
which, like, you don't know.
You don't know how hard that is to get.

98
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,669
Oh God, Jesus. I thought you had
the day off or something.

99
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,507
I didn't realize this would turn into
such an awkward conversation. God.

100
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:22,427
Okay, can we just talk about how
all of a sudden you're a babe girl?

101
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,887
You guys, Joanne is in deep.

102
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:26,807
I've never heard her call
anyone babe before.

103
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,475
Can we talk about something else?

104
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:29,435
Um...

105
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,479
Do you have anything to share, Morgan?

106
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,024
Nope. I guess we'll have to pivot
to audience questions.

107
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:39,903
"A guy ghosted me after I waited
three months to have sex with him."

108
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:41,113
"What do I do?"

109
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,823
First of all, willpower. Um...

110
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,701
Mind if I throw my two cents in?

111
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:47,661
I thought you didn't want
anything to do with the podcast.

112
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:50,163
I don't want any stuff about me on it,
but, you know,

113
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:53,083
I don't mind offering
a little advice on one question.

114
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,043
It's, uh, what I do.

115
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:57,337
- Okay, I don't know...
- A male perspective would be nice.

116
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:58,463
Okay, great.

117
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:03,051
First of all, on behalf of all men, sorry.
Ghosting is never cool.

118
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:05,887
In the <i>Talmud,</i>
Hillel offers us the golden rule.

119
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:08,390
That which is hateful to you,
do not do to others.

120
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:11,768
Now, we hear it all the time.
Treat others how you want to be treated.

121
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:14,813
But I think the reverse applies as well.

122
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,274
How you treat others
is how you treat yourself.

123
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:21,695
So if he can't be honest with you,
he's not honest with himself.

124
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,239
You don't want this guy.

125
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,534
Okay, Rabbi,
that was a really good answer.

126
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:30,287
Yeah, I was just gonna say
she might be bad in bed, but...

127
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:31,789
Next question?

128
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:35,001
Okay, on to the next.

129
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,836
"Can I go out with a guy
my good friend dated

130
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,338
but was never official with?"

131
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,255
- No.
- Yes.

132
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:42,883
- Yes. No. I'll take this one, Joanne.
- No.

133
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:46,094
Hopefully, it ended amicably between them,
but because it ended,

134
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,680
yes, you have every right
to pursue a relationship.

135
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,849
I'm so sorry. I really, really disagree.

136
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,560
You can't ever date the ex of a friend

137
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:56,146
under any circumstance,
and I'm sure Hillel would agree.

138
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,773
What about the rules of love?

139
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,692
Being territorial over someone
it didn't work out with isn't cool.

140
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,820
They have to take a chance
if they think this might be their person.

141
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:07,158
Okay, next question. Where's the last
crazy place you guys had sex?

142
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:09,868
Um...

143
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,870
Oh. We don't do that.

144
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,330
- What do you mean?
- We have...

145
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,539
You know what I mean.

146
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,793
Okay, fine, lame. Um, give me
one juicy thing about your relationship.

147
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:18,752
Well, Morgan...

148
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,962
The freakiest thing
you guys have ever done.

149
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:23,840
We don't do anything
that the audience would find interesting.

150
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:25,008
Wait, that's not true.

151
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,635
Okay, tell me more, Rabbi.

152
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,096
- Say more, into the mic. Into the mic.
- Sorry, sorry.

153
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,808
- Absolutely. Sorry about her.
- I'll let you get back to it.

154
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:35,435
So the thing about Morgan is
that she doesn't understand privacy

155
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:38,230
based on the fact
that all her passwords are 1234,

156
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,774
and I have a folder full of her nudes
on my phone.

157
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:43,443
What the fuck?
Now I have to change all my passwords.

158
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,947
Don't smile. It's not cute.

159
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,911
How much time do you think
until Miri gets back?

160
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:57,624
Like, 42 minutes, you sick fuck.
We are not going again.

161
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,918
No, I was just thinking, like, we can,

162
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,879
you know, have some dessert,
watch something funny on TV.

163
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,008
I love dessert. I love this idea.
What do we have?

164
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,135
You were... I was first.

165
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,011
- No, I was... I was clearly first.
- No.

166
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:12,055
Okay, we've got ice cream sandwiches?

167
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,516
Ice cream sandwich.

168
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,309
Thank you, babe.

169
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,645
- Hello! Are you...
- Oh God, Mom!

170
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,522
- What?
- What are you doing here?

171
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,482
I thought we grabbed your key back.

172
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:23,984
Don't worry, I made a copy.

173
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,193
Hm.

174
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:27,487
Could you excuse us for a moment, please?

175
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:30,657
Oh, of course. So great to see you too.

176
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:33,243
- That's quite an outfit.
- Oh, it's my pleasure.

177
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,579
- What the fuck?
- Very original.

178
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,998
Sweetheart.

179
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,168
You're both half naked.

180
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:45,130
I mean, it's like
a spark has reignited in this marriage.

181
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,132
Yeah.

182
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,217
But it's not going to last.

183
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,511
It's not? Why? What... What do you know?

184
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:55,099
What I know is that you need
to make the most of this moment.

185
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:57,727
Okay. I mean, I think I am.

186
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,479
- Have another baby.
- Oh!

187
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,815
- Shh! Shh.
- Mom, no.

188
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:07,068
Miri's perfect. We're one-hit wonders.
We're not gonna have another baby.

189
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:09,863
Miri's amazing,
but there is only one of her.

190
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:12,991
And babies. Babies are... are a blessing.

191
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,493
And we need more.

192
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,578
And I can't rely on Noah anymore.

193
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,623
Who knows how long it will take him
to come to his senses?

194
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,125
I could be dead by then.

195
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,294
- Oh, Mom.
- What?

196
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,338
I don't want you to die.

197
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,381
Don't worry.

198
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,092
I will always be with you.

199
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,636
I am gonna need that key back.

200
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:33,596
No.

201
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:42,145
Mm. Hi, Dad.

202
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,188
Hey, sweethearts.

203
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,482
Don't get up
or help with any of this stuff.

204
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,776
- Sorry. Didn't know your arms were broken.
- Good.

205
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,612
- Hey, Henry. Great to see you.
- Hey, Noah. How are you?

206
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:53,490
Ah, I'm okay. I'm okay.
Thank you for asking.

207
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:56,368
They actually, uh, hired
a new head rabbi at my temple,

208
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,662
and so it's been a big change,
and I'm kind of...

209
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,331
Hey, do you wanna see a picture
of the new guy I'm dating?

210
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,958
- Okay.
- Oh, look there.

211
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,918
- Cute, right?
- Oh yes.

212
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:08,380
That's Tony, and that's one of
his chihuahuas. He's got three.

213
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,881
- Three chihuahuas?
- Yeah.

214
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,592
We had a fight last night,
and he still hasn't texted me.

215
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:13,635
- No, Dad.
- I'm sorry.

216
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:17,305
We are focusing on Mom today, right now,
and for the whole rest of the day.

217
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,640
- Okay?
- Yeah. All right.

218
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,475
- I'm serious.
- I'm serious too.

219
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:22,477
Morgan is bringing Thai food. What's next?

220
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,479
- Decorations.
- Decorations, okay. Oh!

221
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,897
Ha-Happy birthday!

222
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:29,818
- Happy birthday! Yay! Yes!
- Oh my. Oh my.

223
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,236
- Joanne.
- Yay, happy...

224
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,114
When do you think this will wrap up,
so I can tell Goldie?

225
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:37,826
Uh, I don't think asking when it will end
is in the spirit of the event.

226
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,787
Well, you know, I firmly believe
you have to spend your birthday

227
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:43,498
in the energy you wanna manifest
for the coming year.

228
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:44,791
- I need peace today.
- Yeah.

229
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,002
- I don't want any fighting.
- Yes.

230
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:50,088
No, there's no fighting.
We're all here to celebrate you, Mom.

231
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,673
Look at all the stuff Noah brought.

232
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:54,759
And we got donuts,
and, uh, he bought a tiara.

233
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,554
Also, these temporary tattoos
that say Girl Power. We put 'em on.

234
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:58,680
It's very inspiring.

235
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,390
- Girl Power.
- Girl power.

236
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,851
Oh my God. I always wanted a tramp stamp.

237
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,185
- Today's the day.
- Hi.

238
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,396
- Sorry I'm late.
- Yes, let's do it.

239
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,564
- Hi.
- Hey.

240
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:10,066
This is Dr. Andy.

241
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,735
- Who?
- Uh, hi.

242
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,612
I am Morgan's boyfriend.

243
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,530
Oh.

244
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,908
Please just call me Andy.
Drop the doctor. I don't need that.

245
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:21,077
- Hey, Andy. I love your pants.
- Thank you.

246
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,662
I'm so sorry. I'm confused.

247
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:25,832
Are you an escort,
or are you doing a prank?

248
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,417
Oh my gosh. Well, this is Joanne.

249
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:29,669
- Yeah.
- Has to be. That's a Joanne response.

250
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,172
- I know, right?
- See? Immediately just walls up.

251
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,089
Anyway, I love it.

252
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,758
I'm so honored to meet you all.

253
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,385
I can't wait to get to know you.
I'm gonna put this down.

254
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,597
- Right there, I bet.
- Thank you, baby.

255
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,309
What?

256
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:45,894
Who is that?

257
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,688
He's my boyfriend. I just told you.

258
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:50,982
- Not bad. I like him.
- Thank you.

259
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,110
- I think he's sexy.
- What's going on?

260
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,779
She is fucking nuts if she thinks

261
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,281
she's in charge of me
having a whole-ass baby.

262
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:01,076
Is this <i>The Handmaid's Tale?</i>
I never saw past season one,

263
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:04,080
but I don't think
it gets any better for the gals.

264
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,748
I don't know. I think I hate the idea.

265
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,668
And when she first brought it up,
I was, like, absolutely not.

266
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,586
Right?

267
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,962
Now that you seem, like,
it's never gonna happen,

268
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,757
I don't really know which way I'm leaning.

269
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:17,593
No, I mean...

270
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,969
I just loved it when Miri was little,

271
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:23,223
and she'd have a little temper tantrum
and then she'd tire herself out,

272
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,433
and she'd fall asleep on my chest.
I loved that.

273
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:29,646
Sash, we are five years away
from being empty nesters.

274
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:32,023
We are so close.
Think about the stuff we could do.

275
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,651
You could... You could finally
get your ear pierced.

276
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,653
We could... We could take a dance class.

277
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:39,698
We could try new drugs.
We could live in a cool neighborhood

278
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,284
instead of, like,
right school district neighborhood.

279
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:46,579
We could stay in bed all of Sunday.
Never get out of the bed.

280
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,583
This is the stuff we never got to do
before we had Miri.

281
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:53,002
All right. Rock and roll.
I'll do all that stuff with you.

282
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,295
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

283
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,423
Sash!

284
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,426
Except for the dancing.
I'm too tall to dance.

285
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,761
Hey, who is this Tony guy
Dad keeps talking about?

286
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,430
I didn't know him and Pat broke up.

287
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,725
Okay, I am not fucking talking about Pat.
What is happening?

288
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,644
How do I not know
that you have a boyfriend? Who is he?

289
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:12,313
Where did he come from?
How long has this been going on?

290
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:15,359
Well, I've known him for a little while,
but this all is very new.

291
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:19,237
- Okay, I saw you less than 24 hours ago.
- So?

292
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,698
Since then, you've sent me
a thousand text messages

293
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,700
asking whether or not you have a mustache.

294
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,453
I was trying to be private
while I figured out how I felt. Okay?

295
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:29,956
- I do understand privacy, Joanne.
- You call me about everything.

296
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:33,835
You call me before a date, after a date.
Half the time, you call when on the date.

297
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:37,088
So don't act like it's normal
that you bring some random guy home,

298
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,965
who I've never even heard of,

299
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:41,259
to Mom's birthday
and say he's your boyfriend.

300
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,220
Okay, he is not random, all right? Mm.

301
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:47,265
You're not the only one who gets to have
a "mature adult" partnership.

302
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,685
A mature adult partnership?
Are we on the same planet?

303
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:54,314
You know what? I'm gonna go help
my boyfriend, Andy, set the table.

304
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:58,485
Oh, man, I'm telling you,
it is just really hard dating at my age.

305
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:01,070
- Mm.
- I wish I came out earlier.

306
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:03,239
This all wouldn't just feel so new to me.

307
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,034
Trust me, whenever you get out there,
it's always confusing.

308
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,871
We all feel like we're messing up
all the time, you know?

309
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,289
- I think you're doing a great job.
- Really?

310
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:15,044
I do. I absolutely do.
I also think you need to give Tony a text.

311
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:18,171
- I should text <i>him?</i>
- Yeah, you should text him.

312
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,758
Become worthy
of the relationship you want.

313
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,889
You're really good at this.
Traditionally, the tops text first.

314
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,141
I'm kidding. I'm not gonna tell you
what position I am.

315
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,476
- I'm gonna text him.
- Oh, it's...

316
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,062
- Thank you, Noah.
- My pleasure.

317
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:37,857
- Hi.
- Hey.

318
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,443
- Having fun?
- You know, Henry and I were bonding.

319
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,612
- I think I said something that landed.
- Great.

320
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:45,740
Keep letting him talk about himself,
you'll become his favorite person.

321
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:46,742
Um, hey.

322
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:51,079
Can you go get to know
Morgan's boyfriend, you know?

323
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,708
And do not come back with just,
"He's from Ohio." I need details.

324
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,130
- Girl power.
- Girl power. Thank you.

325
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,467
Hey, Mom, will you help me
find the fun plates in the sauna?

326
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,303
- I love the fun plates.
- Okay.

327
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,179
- We're pulling 'em out?
- Yeah.

328
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,599
I think they're by the snowman.

329
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,767
Let me look.

330
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,060
Uh-huh.

331
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:16,688
I can't believe we're pulling 'em out.
It's here.

332
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:20,608
No, what? Stop looking for the fun plates.
I don't care about the fun plates.

333
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:23,862
- I don't know. Stop. Sit down.
- You told me you wanted the fun plates.

334
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,614
Listen, did you know about Dr. Andy?

335
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:29,951
He's so annoying.
Like, is he even really a real doctor?

336
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,953
He's giving more life coach vibes.

337
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,664
Well, she might have mentioned it.
I'm not sure.

338
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:37,000
You know,
I can never keep up with your sister.

339
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,961
One day she's converting.
The next day she's not converting.

340
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,880
Mom, that was me.

341
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,548
Both my girls are wild cards.

342
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,676
And you know,
I'm not worried about Morgan's beau.

343
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:49,053
I have strong intuition. I like him.

344
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,598
Mm-mm. You're wrong.
Something's off. It feels weird.

345
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:54,642
Otherwise, why would she have
kept this from me for even a second?

346
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:58,771
We tell each other everything. It's like,
what if he's got her in some Ponzi scheme?

347
00:14:58,772 --> 00:14:59,939
Or a pyramid scheme.

348
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,941
Remember when she lost all her money

349
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:05,028
to that guy who said he was gonna
reinvent the hot dog for millennials,

350
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,238
and she kept saying,
"It's a hot dog for us"?

351
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,656
Maybe he's just married.

352
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:12,160
No, Morgan's told me about
plenty of married men. That can't be it.

353
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,370
Are you guys talking about me and Tony?

354
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:15,331
No, honey.

355
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,375
And here's some delicious rice.

356
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:22,629
Oh, baby, can you pour me some water
so I don't get dehydrated?

357
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,881
Of course,<i>principessa.</i>

358
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:25,798
Oh my...

359
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,968
You're so cute.

360
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:29,594
Thank you.

361
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,137
Of course, come here.

362
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:33,932
- Okay. I'm here.
- So beautiful.

363
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,350
So cute.

364
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,601
Oh God.

365
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,937
So how'd you two meet? What's your story?

366
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,939
Give me every little detail.

367
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,316
- Okay. You go.
- Well. Okay.

368
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,568
We met in therapy.

369
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,695
Mm. Group therapy.

370
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:51,366
Well, no, not group therapy.
Um, but that's cool. Keep guessing.

371
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:54,160
Hm. Uh...

372
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,329
The waiting room.

373
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,165
- Nope. Getting warmer though.
- No. Yeah.

374
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,876
All right, let me think here. Uh...

375
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,753
The parking lot. No, no, wait.

376
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:07,048
Uh, the elevator from the parking lot.
You met in the elevator.

377
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,551
- I'm Morgan's therapist.
- Mm.

378
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:14,640
Oh.

379
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,394
- I wasn't warm at all.
- I mean, he's not my therapist anymore.

380
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,646
No, of course
I'm not her therapist anymore.

381
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,481
We had our closeout session last week.

382
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,733
- Of course.
- It was really intense. He cried.

383
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,193
No, I didn't cry. I wept.

384
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,195
You did.

385
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:29,612
Mm.

386
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:31,990
- And you make... You make...
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

387
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,616
<i>It's like a Hallmark movie</i>

388
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:36,494
where two people pretend to be a couple
for a big family gathering.

389
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:40,873
I love that movie. Melissa Joan Hart.
People say I look like her.

390
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:41,875
What?

391
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,252
- I can see...
- Hello.

392
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,713
- Oh, hi.
- Hey, guys.

393
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:50,216
Was just chatting
with Morgan and Dr. Andy.

394
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:52,051
I knew it. He's not a real doctor.

395
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:54,220
I couldn't imagine
letting that guy operate on me.

396
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,597
- He's probably a chiropractor.
- He's her therapist.

397
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,766
- What?
- Yep. Yep. Yep.

398
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,894
- Dr. Andy is Morgan's therapist.
- No.

399
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:04,648
I kissed my therapist once.
But he said it was a trust exercise.

400
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,733
Your responses are alarming.

401
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,360
I have to say,
this is a very concerning situation.

402
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:12,280
Thank you.
Someone finally normal. Thank you.

403
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,782
Our couples therapist?

404
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,117
- Yeah.
- Oh my God.

405
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,869
Where is... Where is everybody?

406
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,954
Did anyone notice a brainwashy energy?

407
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,665
I'd love to be brainwashed.

408
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,834
What the hell?
Are you out here talking shit about me?

409
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:26,335
He's your therapist.

410
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,588
- How do you expect us to react?
- Here we go.

411
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:31,841
Oh, right, and you pick such
perfect relationships, too, Joanne, right?

412
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:35,762
Look at Noah. Fucking loser, jobless,
almost homeless, drifter boyfriend.

413
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,181
Fuck you, bitch!

414
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:43,103
Oh, Tony texted me back. Thank you, Noah.

415
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:48,816
You know what? Do not compare
my relationship to your mental breakdown.

416
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,985
Right, 'cause you're doing so great.

417
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:54,113
Pretending to care about some tradition
none of us wanna be at

418
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,698
because you need to prove something.

419
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:56,949
No, I don't.

420
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:00,203
And I did tell you my therapist
was in love with me many times.

421
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,996
Am I supposed to believe
everything you say?

422
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,998
According to you,
you could've been Meghan Markle.

423
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:07,210
I said I saw Prince Harry at a bar,
and there was a vibe, okay?

424
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:10,713
And there was a vibe. Why do you think
I waited to tell you I fell for Andy?

425
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:14,008
Because I knew that you would be
judgmental about how we met.

426
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,885
Not that you noticed what's going on.

427
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:19,014
You're too caught up in your relationship.
You know what? You all suck.

428
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,267
Come on, we're going.

429
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:26,020
And by the way, this is the first man
I've brought home since my divorce,

430
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:28,231
and none of you have even tried
to get to know him.

431
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,857
- Well, I did.
- It's bullshit.

432
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:33,319
I guess we're still adjusting
to the very jarring fact that

433
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,073
you two are breaking the law by dating.

434
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,450
Andy knows all of my trauma
and all of my baggage,

435
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,701
and he accepts me for it.

436
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:43,746
By the way, you guys are where
I got all my trauma and baggage.

437
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:46,541
This isn't the energy I want
for the rest of my year.

438
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:50,462
You know, I'm so done with all of you.
You know, none of you support me. Not one.

439
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:56,510
I know our relationship started out
in an unorthodox way.

440
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,471
It's not perfect, but we're really happy.

441
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:16,780
You okay?

442
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,116
Will you come lay with me?

443
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,660
With your mom in her bed?

444
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,454
She's pretty locked into her movie.

445
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:26,748
Okay.

446
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:28,876
But no funny business.

447
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,510
So why are you sad?

448
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,429
Do you think I'm judgmental?

449
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,851
I mean, I think you're very passionate,
and I think

450
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:50,314
sometimes you jump to extremes
and commit really hard.

451
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,358
I never do that.

452
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:56,319
- Give me one example when I did that.
- Um...

453
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,323
I mean, you called our sex life
uninteresting on your podcast.

454
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,408
Wow. You really had that loaded
and ready to go?

455
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:03,827
- Okay.
- Maybe.

456
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:07,496
You told me not to say
anything personal about us,

457
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:09,248
so that was me avoiding it.

458
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:11,834
I know. I know you're just trying
to respect my request.

459
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:14,295
Well, off the record, obviously,

460
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,172
I know we do
some pretty interesting stuff.

461
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:19,343
Oh, obvi. Just, you know,
let everyone else know.

462
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,387
Can I give you some advice?

463
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,057
Are you my rabbi now?

464
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,768
No. Just your boyfriend.

465
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,312
I think you should support Morgan.

466
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:33,814
I can't.

467
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:38,653
I can't support her
with an unethical therapist.

468
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:42,531
I'm not saying support the relationship.
I just think you should support her.

469
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:45,452
I mean, it makes a lot of sense
why she was scared to tell you.

470
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,537
She really cares what you think,

471
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:50,290
even though I know she swears she doesn't.

472
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,418
I guess that's true.

473
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,003
Damn.

474
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,923
You are really good at helping people.

475
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,175
Thank you.

476
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,388
I miss it.

477
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,016
I miss being needed by my community.

478
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,728
Sounds like you need a rabbi, Rabbi.

479
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:24,573
I'm sorry you don't get to do the job
you always dreamed of.

480
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:25,492
Oh.

481
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,327
I still will.

482
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:33,083
I'm sorry I pushed you all
to celebrate my way.

483
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,421
I think I've just been channeling
my energies into the wrong places.

484
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,674
I did have fun with your family though.

485
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:44,635
And I'll deny it, but...

486
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,973
I really loved being the one
to tell you all he's her therapist.

487
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:52,143
- Noah Roklov. You're a gossip.
- Mm-hmm.

488
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:55,022
That's against Jewish rules.
You told me that when we met.

489
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:56,440
Aw.

490
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:59,943
Babe, you remember
my first Judaism lesson.

491
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:07,659
I really love you.

492
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:09,328
I love you.

493
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:15,000
What a special moment
for the three of us to share.

494
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,965
This is the energy I wanna manifest.

495
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,801
Me too, Lynn.

496
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:38,940
Hi.

497
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,528
Oh, great. Thanks for ordering me one.

498
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:48,033
- Andy suggested we talk, so I'll go first.
- Mm.

499
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:53,496
- Why does this bother you so much?
- Because he's your therapist.

500
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:56,708
Joanne, he knows every single thing
about me, and he still loves me.

501
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:59,294
I want my, you know,

502
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:01,922
fairy tale too.

503
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:04,841
Okay.

504
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,260
Okay.

505
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:08,969
- Okay.
- I get it.

506
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,806
I will try and do my best
to give him a chance.

507
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:12,724
Thank you.

508
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,519
<i>Today I'll be discussing</i>
Parshat Beshalach.

509
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,731
Now, after the Jews' departure from Egypt,

510
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,192
they had their freedom,
but they had no food.

511
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:24,819
They had no shelter.

512
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:29,074
They wandered through the wilderness
without knowing what would happen next.

513
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,369
Rabbi Roklov?

514
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,203
At my house?

515
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:36,706
- Hey, what's all this?
- Have a seat.

516
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,583
Yeah, I was just in the pool.

517
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:42,295
I was practicing for my scuba lesson.

518
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,713
The wife and I are getting certified.

519
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,132
- Wow.
- Yeah.

520
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,967
Okay, so you're enjoying it.

521
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,260
Retirement?

522
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:53,472
Yeah. And, you know,
the part of your life you didn't plan for.

523
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:56,893
I'd say I'm asking for a friend,
but I think we both know that's not true.

524
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,104
<i>And that's the point of faith, right?</i>

525
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,857
It doesn't exist in the plans we make.

526
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,192
It exists in the unknown.

527
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:08,113
Otherwise, tough decisions would be easy.
There'd be no risk.

528
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:12,283
All right, now, that's a cute baby.

529
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,325
She is cute.

530
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:15,745
The moment after you
take a leap of faith...

531
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,582
that's the scariest time.

532
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:21,083
You know what? Fuck it. Let's do it.

533
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:23,295
- What?
- Let's have another baby.

534
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:27,841
She's not that cute.

535
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,135
Because you can't go back.

536
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,596
You don't know if it'll work out.

537
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:38,018
I've been freaking the fuck out
about not working. Avoided it for years.

538
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:39,978
Turns out,

539
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:43,773
I feel my most free when I'm in the water.

540
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:46,151
Never could have planned for that.

541
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:50,197
But if you don't risk,
you might not experience life.

542
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:55,494
You might never learn
if that person is right for you,

543
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,039
or if you love to swim.

544
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,750
Here's what I do know.

545
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,211
Over these last few days,

546
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,463
I've been reminded

547
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:10,591
that there are people
who need what I have to give.

548
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:13,928
This new guy is a great rabbi

549
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,514
because we know what we're getting.

550
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:19,725
You are a great rabbi
because you think outside the box.

551
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:20,894
So trust yourself.

552
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,937
Figure it out.

553
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:26,399
Now, this congregation
has begun its next chapter.

554
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,693
And it's not what I had planned.

555
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:32,197
So now I need to find my next chapter too.

556
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:38,078
It's been an honor and a privilege
getting to know you.

557
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:43,792
I love you all, and I plan to see you
many more times throughout the years.

558
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:47,462
It's time for me
to wander through the wilderness.

559
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:51,967
Oh my God.

560
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:56,053
This will be my final sermon
at Temple Chai.

561
00:25:56,054 --> 00:26:00,182
<i>My dirty secret in an old coat pocket</i>

562
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:04,353
<i>My dirty laundry underneath your bed</i>

563
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:08,649
<i>I had a dream I had you in my kitchen</i>

564
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:14,239
<i>And now you're in my head
You're living in my head</i>

565
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:25,666
<i>A palamino in a midland accent</i>

566
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:28,670
<i>I wasn't wild, but I could have been</i>

567
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:33,674
<i>I like the way
You answer all my questions</i>

568
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:38,680
<i>Can I see you again?
Can I see you again?</i>

569
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:42,267
<i>If I want to</i>

570
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:46,855
<i>If I have you on my mind</i>

571
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:50,191
<i>If I'm patient</i>

572
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:56,197
<i>If it's complicated
Then it's complicated</i>
