1
00:00:06,923 --> 00:00:09,050
<i>Tiptoed around</i>

2
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:12,720
<i>I tried to play it cool
My head in...</i>

3
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:16,765
Okay, girls. It's February 13th.
Get ready for some weepy callers.

4
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:18,851
Valentine's Day is a trigger
for straight people.

5
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,353
What time is our lunch tomorrow?

6
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,939
Uh, noon. At the fancy margarita place.

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,942
Wait, you two still do
your Valentine's Day drunk lunch?

8
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:29,028
Yeah, duh. We've been doing it
since middle school.

9
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,030
What about Noah and Dr. Andy?

10
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,323
Mm, Noah and I will probably
have a low-key dinner.

11
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:35,492
I mean, I'm not really
a Valentine's Day girl.

12
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:37,202
See, I never thought I was,

13
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:40,748
but now that I'm with Dr. Andy,
I am, like, so into it.

14
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:43,292
It's, like, maybe just about
being with the right person.

15
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,461
Okay, you have to stop
calling him Dr. Andy.

16
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:46,921
Yeah, I can't.

17
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:51,425
It's like someone asking you to start
calling your teacher by their first name.

18
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:53,136
You can't say the word Andy?

19
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:55,763
Doc... Andy.

20
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,264
- Mm.
- Okay.

21
00:00:57,265 --> 00:01:00,893
And maybe just stop having sex dreams
about your boyfriend's dad, okay?

22
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,896
- <i>Yeah, sure. I'll try.</i>
- Valid.

23
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,689
Okay, next we have Melanie.

24
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:09,068
<i>My question is for Joanne.
I heard your boyfriend on the podcast.</i>

25
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,695
<i>Noah's Corner?</i>
That's what he's been calling it.

26
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:12,613
I know, gross.

27
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,281
<i>Whatever. I just cannot believe</i>

28
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:17,034
<i>that The Prophet turned out
to be Noah fucking Roklov.</i>

29
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,619
- Ooh!
- <i>I dated him years ago...</i>

30
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,787
I'll bleep the last name.

31
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,371
- Shh!
- <i>It did not end well.</i>

32
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:23,332
<i>He acted like he was obsessed with me.</i>

33
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:26,543
<i>When I referred to him as my boyfriend,
he dumped me out of nowhere.</i>

34
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:29,463
Oh shit. That's a major red flag, no?

35
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:32,007
<i>He's one of those guys
whose MO is being romantic</i>

36
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:34,134
<i>so you feel like
you have a special connection</i>

37
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:36,845
<i>when, really,
I could have been literally anyone.</i>

38
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:39,181
<i>It's just how he is
with everyone he dates.</i>

39
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:41,517
Wow, Melanie,
you're getting a lot off your chest.

40
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:44,686
I mean, Melanie, that is awful, okay?

41
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:48,649
I am so sorry that happened to you.
Some guys are just such assholes.

42
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,901
So if you could walk us back
to the beginning

43
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,319
and give us a play-by-play...

44
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,364
- She's said enough. Hang up.
- We shouldn't hang up on a listener.

45
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:56,406
She's not done.

46
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:57,825
- Stop. Give it...
- <i>What?</i>

47
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,785
- Joanne.
- She's still on the phone!

48
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,120
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Ow!

49
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,204
We're cutting that.

50
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:04,540
Oh my God! You literally broke my finger.

51
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,834
Ow! And you know what?
Fuck you at the same time.

52
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,919
Literally, I can't move it now.

53
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,547
Oh God.
And you already have carpal tunnel.

54
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:14,049
Part of me was like,
did this girl actually date Noah,

55
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,467
or was she just stalking him?

56
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,052
- Huh.
- I mean, it was insane.

57
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:20,097
No, I mean, Melanie and I did date,
but it was a long time ago.

58
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,558
It was pretty casual.

59
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:26,019
Right. Well, like I thought,
her version was inaccurate.

60
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,856
Yeah. She always thought
we were more serious than I did

61
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,775
just 'cause I got her flowers
on her birthday.

62
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,653
You bought flowers on her birthday?

63
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:37,448
I buy every woman in my life flowers
on their birthday.

64
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:41,870
What else did you do
that made her think it was serious?

65
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,540
I visited her mom in the hospital.

66
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:47,624
I'm a rabbi!

67
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,543
Wha...

68
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:50,670
Okay, anything else?

69
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,214
I took her to my cousin's wedding,
but it was a small thing.

70
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:55,674
It was a last-ditch effort to see...

71
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,218
She was your date
to an intimate family wedding?

72
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,721
I ended things right after.

73
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:04,184
But you can see how she might've been
blindsided by that. Yes?

74
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:09,730
Yeah, I do. I do now.
But, you know, it was a long time ago.

75
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:13,359
I was, uh, young and dumb
and made some mistakes.

76
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,405
What about your other girlfriends,
like Rebecca?

77
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:22,159
From what I understand,
she felt pretty blindsided as well.

78
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,455
Joanne, this is crazy. Come on.
I'm a good boyfriend. You know that.

79
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:29,374
I know. You're the best boyfriend.

80
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,044
Until you say
you were never their boyfriend at all.

81
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:35,756
Melanie literally thought everything I did
meant I was her serious boyfriend

82
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,967
when I was just doing the things
that you are supposed to do

83
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,553
when you're dating someone.

84
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,057
I think you need to reach out to Rebecca.

85
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,850
What? Why?

86
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:49,895
Because this girl made it seem
like you were a walking red flag, Noah,

87
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,522
and I don't like the feeling
that I'm having right now.

88
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:55,860
And if this is
a relationship pattern of yours, I need...

89
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,612
I don't know.
I think you should sit with Rebecca,

90
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:01,740
hear her side of the story,
and learn from it

91
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:05,078
so that you don't one day do to me
what you did to them.

92
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:12,502
Oh, okay. If it's that important to you,

93
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:13,919
I will do it.

94
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,213
Thank you.

95
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:17,756
Will you do it now
so we can get it over with?

96
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,634
I just spent three hours
on the phone with my mother.

97
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:23,095
- Don't make me do it.
- I'm not gonna feel right until we...

98
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,471
Okay, I'll do it right now.

99
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:25,640
Thank you.

100
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:38,068
So, yeah, I mean,
I think we were both aware

101
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,737
that we had some... some major issues,

102
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:43,115
but we never did a proper post-mortem,

103
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:46,159
so if there's anything
you wanna get off your chest or ask me,

104
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,953
I wanna give you the space.

105
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,330
Okay, so, yeah...

106
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:53,834
Was definitely not aware
that we were having major issues.

107
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,794
- Okay.
- You named our unborn children.

108
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,963
Referred to me as your forever family.

109
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,132
We booked
a non-refundable trip to Portugal

110
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,551
two weeks before you broke up with me.

111
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:06,179
I had zero idea
that you were having any doubts.

112
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,933
Noah, you were always so romantic
and... and lovey-dovey with me.

113
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,560
Listen, you were my girlfriend.

114
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:14,104
I didn't know
what was gonna happen between us.

115
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:17,942
I didn't know for sure, so, you know,
I didn't wanna hurt your feelings.

116
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,486
You broke up with me.

117
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,989
You hurt my feelings.

118
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,033
Okay.

119
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:29,202
I don't know what to say.
I really am sorry.

120
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:32,205
I tried really hard
to be a good boyfriend to you,

121
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:34,083
and, honestly, I think I was.

122
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,754
I'm sure you do.

123
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:53,603
Oh my God.

124
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:59,066
Happy Valentine's Day, my love.

125
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:03,570
Oh, baby! Happy Valentine's Day!

126
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:06,823
Oh God! Is this "Kiss From a Rose"?

127
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:09,701
The song that you wish
you lost your virginity to. Yes.

128
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,662
And my secret favorite meal.

129
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:14,623
I mean, come on.

130
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:20,087
There's more. There's a little secret
at the... bottom of one of these scoops.

131
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,672
Okay.

132
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,841
Where's this secret?

133
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:25,968
- Oh.
- There it is.

134
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:30,555
Is this the start to a scavenger hunt?

135
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:34,351
I mean, I gotta say, I get really
turned off by, like, riddles and puns.

136
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,145
That's the key to my house.

137
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:40,524
- Uh...
- Morgan, I want you to move in with me.

138
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,735
I can't get enough of you.

139
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:44,654
Oh. Wha...

140
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:49,282
I... can't get enough of you either,
but I just...

141
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:51,993
Have we been together long enough?
Do we even really know each other?

142
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,787
- Yeah.
- Those are valid questions.

143
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:56,081
Which is why
you don't have to answer today.

144
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:59,000
I just want you to know
this is where I'm at,

145
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,962
and there's so much more
to this beautiful day,

146
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:04,464
for this beautiful woman named Morgan.

147
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:05,841
Oh my God.

148
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:09,261
Yeah, we're fine, you know?
She made her points, and I heard her.

149
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,762
God, she's so evolved.

150
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:14,307
I wish all my exes were dead,
or at least in bad marriages, you know?

151
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:16,560
So did you guys
dissect the relationship or...

152
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,478
It's our first Valentine's Day together.

153
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,857
I don't wanna talk about Rebecca, okay?
Got a lot of surprises for you.

154
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,942
Okay, fine, if you have surprises.

155
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,486
I'm looking forward
to spending the whole day together.

156
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:27,572
Me too.

157
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,616
I am gonna have lunch with Morgan,
so I thought we would do a dinner thing?

158
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:34,119
Okay, I did have a lunch plan.

159
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,831
We were gonna take
a pasta-making class at Osteria Mozza.

160
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,541
- Oh!
- You love pasta.

161
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:42,127
I do love pasta, and I love Mozza.

162
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,921
Um, drunk lunch
is kind of an annual thing.

163
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:47,174
Um, maybe we could invite Morgan too.

164
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:50,178
Maybe pasta and wine
can serve as drunk lunch this year.

165
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,805
- I'll check the app, see if there's room.
- Okay.

166
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,891
- You ready to do presents?
- Yes, I wanna go first.

167
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,268
Oh, okay, hit me.

168
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,355
- Ooh!
- It's big.

169
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:04,649
- What could this be?
- Dig in, boy.

170
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,360
All right. I like to read the card first.

171
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,654
Okay, it's right there.

172
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,116
Okay.

173
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,119
Holy shit.

174
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,288
Come on!

175
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:21,583
{\an8}This was my favorite movie growing up.
I always wanted this poster.

176
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:24,503
{\an8}My mom would never let me have it.
She said it didn't go with my room.

177
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:28,048
I know. I texted the Matzah Ballers
for ideas, and it all came together.

178
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,050
Gosh. Mm.

179
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,968
- I love it. Thank you.
- Yeah.

180
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,804
- You ready for yours?
- Oh yeah!

181
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,768
- Did Morgan help you?
- I don't need any help.

182
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:40,895
Oh, okay.

183
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:43,981
For you.

184
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,317
Hold on. There's a card.

185
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,028
- Gotta read the card.
- Okay.

186
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:54,158
- Oh, wow! You wrote me an entire card.
- Yeah.

187
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:57,203
Gonna read it as soon as I open it.

188
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,919
- Do you like it?
- It's gorgeous.

189
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,421
It's a Jennifer Meyer.
Apparently, it's a whole thing.

190
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,090
It's definitely a thing, yeah.

191
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,341
Okay, try it on.

192
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,803
Uh, okay. Okay.

193
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:16,638
Aw.

194
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,307
It looks beautiful.

195
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,562
What do you think, Shaq?

196
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,604
Look familiar?

197
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,982
Hold on. I can't move. I'm being painted.

198
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,025
<i>Another Dr. Andy Valentine's Day gift.</i>

199
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:31,027
<i>Excuse me, could I please have a minute?</i>

200
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,070
Thank you.

201
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,281
Thank you, I appreciate it. Okay.

202
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,283
<i>Look.</i>

203
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:37,867
<i>It's the same necklace.</i>

204
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:39,828
The same exact one that Rebecca has.

205
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,788
Oh fuck. Really?

206
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:44,624
I know every photo of her
that exists on the Internet,

207
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:48,795
and this necklace with her name on it
is in her LinkedIn profile.

208
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,922
Oh my God, Noah. Rookie move.

209
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:54,092
Does he get all his girlfriends
the same gift for Valentine's Day?

210
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,469
<i>I mean, at least it's real gold, right?</i>

211
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,847
No, Morgan, you don't get it.

212
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:03,476
For me, this relationship
is special and unique,

213
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:06,021
and I thought it was for him too.

214
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,982
<i>He's always saying how different I am
than anyone else he's dated,</i>

215
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:12,986
but apparently,
I'm just the latest Melanie or Rebecca.

216
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:16,239
How would I even know,
since he treats us all exactly the same?

217
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,825
Okay. Well, what are you gonna do?

218
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:21,036
<i>Gonna see how
the rest of the day goes, I guess.</i>

219
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,245
But he's on notice.

220
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:23,873
<i>Okay. Well, keep me posted.</i>

221
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,208
Hey, can you come back?

222
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,461
Thank you. I'm ready.

223
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,340
Is this a good... angle?

224
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:36,843
And that would result
in what I would call a good kind of chaos.

225
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:40,138
Now, you will see in slide four
that statistics show

226
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:43,892
only children are more likely
to commit violent crimes

227
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,685
than children with siblings.

228
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,437
That is pictured here.

229
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,481
Oh, she actually looks really cute there.

230
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:54,527
Yeah, she does. She is also serving life
in prison with no possibility of parole.

231
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:57,280
Now, on a more positive note,

232
00:10:57,281 --> 00:11:00,534
this is what ChatGPT thinks
our next baby could look like.

233
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,746
- Oh! I hate it.
- I hadn't seen it on the big screen.

234
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,289
That's pretty alarming.

235
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,582
- Hello.
- Oh, hey.

236
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,334
- Oh shit. The bubble machine.
- Hi.

237
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,460
- Yeah.
- I forgot.

238
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:13,296
- Happy Valentine's Day, Queen Esther.
- Noah.

239
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:16,341
Ah, you <i>mensch.</i>
They're even bigger than last year.

240
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,843
For an unemployed guy,
you got your priorities in order.

241
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,346
Yeah. You guys watching a horror movie?
What is that?

242
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,765
It's supposed to be
what our next baby would look like,

243
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,767
but Esther doesn't let me
take pictures of her,

244
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,978
so I had to use
one of my face mixed with Miriam's.

245
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:31,231
Wha... You're a sick, sick man.

246
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,148
Yuck.

247
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:35,318
There are a couple more slides, so why
don't you flip through the next couple?

248
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:39,323
- We're gonna go get the bubble machine.
- Okay. I... I hate this baby.

249
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,783
Oh, great. You made me hold it?

250
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:45,036
Giving Joanne the old Noah Roklov
Valentine's Day special, I see?

251
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,788
Yep, never fails.

252
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:50,333
Hey, uh, hot goss in our house.
You saw Rebecca?

253
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:54,504
- Esther already got the play-by-play, huh?
- That's bad PR for you, bro.

254
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:58,216
- Don't let Joanne find out about that.
- Dude, Joanne's the one who made me do it.

255
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,009
Is that the freaky shit you guys are into?

256
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,929
We got into a thing about my exes.
I'm trying to make her feel better.

257
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,265
All right,
you're gonna have to go hard, bro.

258
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,934
Might need another bubble machine.

259
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,898
Okay.

260
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,151
Oh my God. You guys look crazy.

261
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,360
- Hey.
- What?

262
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:19,487
I surprised Joanne
with a tandem bike ride.

263
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:20,948
We biked all the way here.

264
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:25,744
Oh. Okay. Wow.
Like... Like, Muppet style, or...

265
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,120
- It was cute.
- Yeah.

266
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,913
I didn't realize
how many hills the city had.

267
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:33,168
Yeah. It's a tad more strenuous than
Google Maps would lead you to believe.

268
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,211
Yeah, well, exercise is medicine.

269
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:38,047
It'll shake up some of that
rootless, out-of-work energy

270
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,716
I get from you, so that's nice.

271
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:40,925
- Are you... Do you...
- Don't.

272
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,969
- Does it?
- It's sad.

273
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,680
Oh my God.
I just got a whiff of my dead grandma.

274
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:47,849
Oh! Yeah, um...

275
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,436
So Dr. Andy took me to this lab
where this scientist made a perfume

276
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,438
that smells exactly like Grandma Minnie.

277
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,273
- It was crazy.
- Yikes.

278
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:59,486
Ciao, <i>ragazzi.</i> Welcome to Osteria Mozza.

279
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:02,781
We're so happy you chose to book
an Airbnb experience with us today,

280
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:06,327
and what a day it will be
because we will be making

281
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:09,704
fresh cavatelli pasta
from scratch, which...

282
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:12,332
Hey. I'm sorry. This is driving me crazy.
I have to do this.

283
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,666
- Oh my God.
- Your hair is like...

284
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,627
I have to fix this. You look insane.

285
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,212
- Okay. We're good.
- Jesus.

286
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,547
I will help you shape the pasta.

287
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:20,590
- Mm.
- Oh my God.

288
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,383
That's the part.
That's the money right here.

289
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:25,428
- What are we doing here?
- What? It's cute. You love pasta.

290
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,473
I know, but when does the drinking start?

291
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:32,101
Uh, excuse me. Are we gonna be
getting wine with our class today?

292
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:34,187
Of course.
Allow me to pour your first taste.

293
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:36,023
- Great.
- There you go.

294
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,235
Oh.

295
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,278
That's...

296
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:44,030
- Why did...
- Oh, no, you can keep going. Just...

297
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,573
More to come. Enjoy.

298
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:46,492
Oh.

299
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,328
We can't get a full glass of wine?

300
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,956
- I think it's a tasting. I'm sorry.
- No, don't be sorry.

301
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:56,335
Yeah, drunk lunch where
you can't get drunk. It's totally perfect.

302
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,878
- Do you wanna go to the bathroom?
- Sure.

303
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,131
- Okay.
- All right, I'll see you.

304
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:06,970
Noah, I heard that you went on a date
with your ex-girlfriend yesterday.

305
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,557
That's an interesting move, my guy.

306
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:18,356
Bringing me to a dance studio
on Valentine's Day?

307
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:22,527
Babe, what is this?
I thought you said tall men can't dance.

308
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,113
Well, it's your dream,
so let's try it, you know?

309
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:29,869
Hello, I'm Antonio, and today I'm going
to teach you the art of the tango.

310
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:31,871
I'm listening.

311
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,582
Okay, I have a secret.

312
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,543
Is that why you're smiling?
I thought you guys were on MDMA.

313
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:42,214
Okay, so Dr. Andy asked me
to move in with him.

314
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,716
- He what?
- I know.

315
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,009
Um...

316
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:49,387
I mean, I am supportive.
Just... Doesn't that feel a little fast?

317
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:52,432
Nothing's decided yet.
He said I could take as long as I need.

318
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,767
Right. Right. Um...

319
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,811
Well, only you know what's right for you.

320
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:59,772
Exactly. Every couple
moves at their own pace, right?

321
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:02,443
Yeah. Yeah. Wait.
What's that supposed to mean?

322
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,153
Like literally what I just said.

323
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,615
Right, but not every pace
is healthy or normal.

324
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:11,159
Some might say
there's such a thing as too fast.

325
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,952
Uh, or too slow.

326
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:15,788
- You don't wanna start this with me.
- What?

327
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:17,916
A private orchestra
and Grandma Minnie's perfume?

328
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,292
We make fun of stuff like that.

329
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,210
Well, people change in relationships.

330
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,296
You say "babe," and I get amazing gifts

331
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:26,550
that weren't also given to every girl
who came before me, so...

332
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,928
I know you don't have to pee,
so we should get back out there.

333
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,847
Oh God, do we have to?
Your boyfriend ruined drunk lunch.

334
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,767
I know, I know, but...

335
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,186
You have to admit, it looks fun.

336
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,562
You're really talented.

337
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,356
- There's a little drizzle.
- Yes.

338
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,107
Look at that. That's amazing!

339
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,027
Perfecto! Is that perfect?

340
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,487
Should we grab a bottle of wine?

341
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:48,446
No, we cannot.

342
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,990
Why not? I have a corkscrew.
It'll be fun. We'll be heroes.

343
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:53,284
No. We're here with a rabbi.
We have to be cool.

344
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,453
God, Noah is such a narc.

345
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,665
Fine. Fine. Fine!

346
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:01,126
- Come on. Ow!
- You have it in your hand.

347
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,086
Oh God.

348
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,755
Five, six, seven, eight.

349
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:09,634
And a one, a two, a three, a four.
Finish, five.

350
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,469
- Excellent.
- Something like that, babe?

351
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,346
- Sasha. Sasha, now you.
- Yeah. Okay.

352
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,682
- So it's just, like, eight.
- And five, six...

353
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:19,227
Seven. Yes, eight.
And then it's sort of a grapevine.

354
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,979
- He did a... Sorry.
- You're good.

355
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,356
A little bit deadweight,
but he's doing his best.

356
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,399
Let's take five.

357
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,775
- Yeah.
- We're taking a break?

358
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,569
I'm hot anyway. I need a break.

359
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,404
- Okay. Hey.
- It's cute, babe.

360
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:33,157
Um, this is so fun. Could you just,
like, kind of stand right there?

361
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,575
This is my take-a-break spot?

362
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,703
- What are you doing?
- This is your break spot.

363
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:37,871
Hey, Antonio.

364
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,330
Hit it.

365
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:42,583
<i>Rather be tied up with calls
And not strings</i>

366
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,377
<i>Write my own checks...</i>

367
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,336
What are you doing?

368
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,422
<i>Sing, yeah
My wrist, stop watchin'</i>

369
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,257
<i>My neck is flossy</i>

370
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,675
<i>Make big deposits</i>

371
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,635
<i>My gloss is poppin'</i>

372
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,345
<i>You like my hair?</i>

373
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,180
<i>Gee, thanks, just bought it</i>

374
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,558
<i>I see it, I like it, I want it...</i>

375
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,559
It gets better.

376
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,352
<i>I want it, I got it</i>

377
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,397
<i>I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it</i>

378
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,441
<i>I want it, I got it</i>

379
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,109
<i>You like my hair?</i>

380
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,819
<i>Gee, thanks, just bought it</i>

381
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,615
<i>I see it, I like it
I want it, I got it, yeah</i>

382
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,951
Babe!

383
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:21,206
Oh my God! I love you so much.

384
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,042
Ridiculous.

385
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,169
You know I'm getting targeted ads
for chic moving companies

386
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,087
because of Morgan and Andy?

387
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,423
They're sick.

388
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:31,967
You wanna take a bath together?

389
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:35,094
It's 75 degrees out.

390
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,013
Come on.

391
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,639
Baths are fun. Baths are intimate.

392
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,310
Why don't you come lay with me,
and I'll show you my TikTok algorithm?

393
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,519
That's intimate.

394
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,523
But taking a bath is like
sitting on the couch, except it's better.

395
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:50,026
I just re-blow-dried my hair
to get rid of the helmet head.

396
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,027
Wear a shower cap.

397
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:54,238
No! That's the one thing I vowed
I would never do in front of a man.

398
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,492
Come on. It's Valentine's Day.

399
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,292
See?

400
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,920
- It's not just an ordinary bath.
- Mm-mm.

401
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,713
- It's an experience.
- Yeah.

402
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:12,382
- It's good, right?
- Yeah.

403
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,885
- Just a little hot. Are you hot?
- No.

404
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:18,221
- No, no, no. No, I'm good.
- Okay.

405
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,849
Here, turn this way.

406
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:22,768
Okay.

407
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,478
Let me just...

408
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:28,356
- Easy does it, easy does it.
- Okay.

409
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,357
Okay.

410
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,316
Oh. Ow.

411
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:31,859
- There you are. I got you.
- Yeah.

412
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,655
Just got a little in my eye. It's okay.

413
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,909
Just relax.

414
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:43,496
You know what? I'm gonna turn the AC on
just for a sec, okay?

415
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,581
- Uh, okay.
- Yeah.

416
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:53,339
Oh God, you are gonna have to do that
all over again so Miriam can see.

417
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:57,093
Wait, no. I'm not gonna
do a sexy dance for our daughter.

418
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,928
Oh, that was supposed to be sexy.

419
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,639
- Yes.
- Babe!

420
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:06,561
- Oh, it's Morgan. I can ignore it.
- Yeah. No. Answer it.

421
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:10,356
- No. I can let it go to voicemail.
- No, you can absolutely answer it.

422
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,775
- Oh my... Hi, Morgan.
- Hi.

423
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:15,987
Hi, you have Esther and I
here together on Valentine's Day.

424
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,613
Okay, you don't have to be weird.

425
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:21,450
But, Morgan, why the fuck
are you calling on Valentine's Day?

426
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:23,411
<i>Who the fuck cares it's Valentine's Day?</i>

427
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,621
<i>Haven't you been married
for a thousand years?</i>

428
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:28,417
Yeah, but it feels like one day to me.

429
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:32,879
<i>Um, can Sasha come talk to me?
I need advice. Esther, you can come too.</i>

430
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,257
Oh my God, thank you so much
for the invite, but hell fucking no.

431
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:39,969
Why don't you go ahead and
call back tomorrow, or, you know, never?

432
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,598
- <i>Well, I'm literally out front.</i>
- What?

433
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,393
- Morgan.
- Oh, hey.

434
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,228
Fine. He can come outside
and talk to you, like,

435
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:52,273
through the car window
for two minutes or less.

436
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,775
- <i>Perfect, thank you.</i>
- Yeah, I'm getting a timer.

437
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:57,696
I think she's serious about
the two minutes. I'll be right out.

438
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,489
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

439
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,825
- Hi.
- Hi.

440
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,536
- What are we doing?
- What's up?

441
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,537
Oh, um, can I get in?

442
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,081
You're getting in the car?
Yeah, keep the window open.

443
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:11,334
Do you want me
to, like, do a voice recording?

444
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:13,503
- I'll play it for you later. Yes? Okay.
- Yes.

445
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:17,048
I didn't think she was gonna say yes.
I'm not gonna do it.

446
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,259
- I set the timer for two minutes.
- Okay, well, this won't take long.

447
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,970
I know that everyone
is, like, skeptical of me and Dr. Andy,

448
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:25,807
but for this conversation,
will you just set that aside?

449
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:27,768
Yeah, okay. Clean slate.

450
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:30,437
Okay, so, um,

451
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,023
Dr. Andy asked me to move in with him.

452
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,650
- Mm.
- Uh, wow.

453
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:36,609
Yeah?

454
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,487
Moving in with somebody you just started
dating is the worst idea ever.

455
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,197
I know. I know.

456
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:44,993
I don't feel ready, but, like,
I don't know, maybe I'm just scared?

457
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:50,289
Well, being scared isn't, like, a reason
to do something or not do something.

458
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,792
Right? Like, I still regret
not going up on the stage

459
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:55,044
at a Criss Angel show in Vegas.

460
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,671
That was probably smart, but yeah.

461
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:59,758
What's up with this guy? You really
fell in love with your therapist?

462
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:02,677
I really did.

463
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:05,680
I mean, and he, like, really loves me.

464
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,516
I mean, I wasn't sure
I would ever be loved like this.

465
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,143
I mean, I even thought I might just,

466
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:13,355
I don't know, be unlovable, period.

467
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,232
I was, like, all ready
to, like, look inward

468
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,943
and, like, figure out what exactly
was so wrong with me,

469
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,404
but then Dr. Andy came along
and now I don't have to,

470
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,657
and it's, like, amazing, you know?

471
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,159
Well, what's holding you back?

472
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:29,704
He's like... intense, you know?

473
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,747
His love for me is, like, all-consuming,

474
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:33,833
and I get wrapped up in it
when I'm with him,

475
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:36,836
but then I leave to take a shower,
and I'm like, "What am I doing?"

476
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,046
You know, this is moving way too quickly.

477
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:41,717
Well, then slow it down.
You know, there's no rush.

478
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,261
Yeah.

479
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,470
- You're right. Totally.
- Yeah.

480
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:50,057
Okay. I'm just gonna, like, tell him
that I cannot move in with him, you know?

481
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:52,685
It's just like too soon, you know?
We're not the Biebers.

482
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:56,564
Although those guys, like,
they really waited for a long time...

483
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,566
- And two minutes.
- Oh, that's it.

484
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,402
- Okay, thank you.
- Great to see you.

485
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:01,737
Bye.

486
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,488
All right. Oh, uh, happy Valentine's Day.

487
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,241
- Happy Valentine's Day.
- Thank you.

488
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,452
- God. Bye.
- Bye.

489
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:17,460
Oh, what do you think of these right here?

490
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,627
Yeah, I love them.

491
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:21,340
And they're yours.

492
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:25,760
Sorry, what do you mean? I...

493
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:29,723
A friend of mine did cross-pollination.
I arranged to have them named after you.

494
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:31,308
The Morchid.

495
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,518
Oh... my God.

496
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,270
Dr. Andy, this is way too much.

497
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:38,814
- I just have to tell you...
- No, hold on one second.

498
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:41,317
Just... Just look at me for a second. Okay?

499
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:44,487
I know there's a tough, cynical woman
inside of you,

500
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,531
and she's shouting no to all of this.

501
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,909
But these flowers are not for that woman.

502
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:53,537
These are for the Morgan
whose parents didn't bring a single flower

503
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:57,375
when she starred
in <i>Memoirs of a Geisha,</i> ninth grade.

504
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,543
Oh my God.

505
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,795
I can't believe you remembered that.

506
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,381
Are you kidding me? Of course I do.

507
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,177
Okay. Let's do it.

508
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:09,637
- Come on.
- Yeah, let's move in.

509
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,263
Come on. Are you serious?

510
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:13,350
- I'm serious.
- Oh my God.

511
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:19,063
- We have to take all these home now.
- No, we can leave them.

512
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,400
- Okay, yeah. It's heavy.
- But it's very sweet.

513
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:31,451
Hey, you okay?

514
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:34,203
Oh, yeah. It was just getting
a little hot in there.

515
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:37,456
Mm. Right. Well, when you're ready,
throw some clothes on

516
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:39,333
'cause I got one more surprise for you.

517
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:40,459
Yeah?

518
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,671
We're going... on a night hike.

519
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:46,507
A night hike?

520
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:47,968
Yeah. No good?

521
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:51,972
I just kind of want this day to be over.

522
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:53,389
I...

523
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,141
Really? What?

524
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,436
Noah, I say this with love.

525
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:02,274
This was the worst Valentine's Day ever.

526
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:03,859
What?

527
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,780
Did you get me the same necklace
that you got for Rebecca?

528
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,032
Oh, I mean,

529
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,242
not the same exact one.

530
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:16,163
The same, except mine says Joanne,
and hers says Rebecca.

531
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:19,332
Oh, well, then, yeah.

532
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:23,377
- Noah, what the fuck? That's...
- What? It's a beautiful necklace.

533
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:25,463
I thought it would be perfect
for my girlfriend.

534
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,506
But I'm not your girlfriend.

535
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:30,509
I'm Joanne, okay?
I don't want you to do the things

536
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,595
you think you're supposed to do
when you're dating.

537
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:35,724
I want you to do the things you do
when you're going out with me.

538
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,185
- Like...
- Okay.

539
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:42,188
Remember when you got me the nightstand?
The most romantic thing ever?

540
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:45,149
I'm not gonna get you
a piece of furniture for Valentine's Day.

541
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,526
Why not? That's what you aren't getting.

542
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:50,821
The way you are every day, naturally,

543
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,490
that's romantic.

544
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:57,203
It's when you slip into this, like,
good boyfriend mode that it gets weird.

545
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,371
- It just... just...
- Oh.

546
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,624
It doesn't seem real.

547
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:04,544
Okay.

548
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:09,965
You know, Rebecca actually said
something along those lines.

549
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:11,008
I'm sorry, what?

550
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:13,344
Yeah, she was... She was kind of angry.

551
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:16,055
- She felt like I led her on.
- Why didn't you tell me this?

552
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,848
I didn't want you
to see me through her eyes.

553
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:20,143
I don't want you
to think of me as a bad person.

554
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:22,978
Oh my God, Noah.

555
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:26,650
This... This version of you,
telling me the truth,

556
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:32,113
I like that so much better than the idea
of you being a perfect person.

557
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:34,866
Because you're not perfect.

558
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:37,618
And that's a good thing.

559
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:40,664
There's only room for one perfect person
in this relationship.

560
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:42,541
- That's me.
- Yeah.

561
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:50,339
You know... I'm actually glad
you hated this Valentine's Day.

562
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,258
I mean, hate is a really strong word.

563
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:53,968
No, it's not, but that's good.

564
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:58,097
Because, listen,
us being honest with each other,

565
00:25:58,098 --> 00:25:59,765
even when it's difficult,

566
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:03,477
that's something I haven't been able to do
in any of these other relationships.

567
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:04,437
So to me,

568
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:09,192
this is my perfect Valentine's Day
because it brought me to this.

569
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,028
- Thank you.
- Mm.

570
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,283
And I can return the necklace.

571
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,785
No, I'm gonna keep it.
It's the concept I didn't like.

572
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:21,454
- I can return it.
- Don't you dare.

573
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:23,872
While we're being honest,

574
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:27,001
I do have one little thing
that bothered me that you did today.

575
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,628
- We're not talking about me...
- You didn't write me a card.

576
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:32,464
I want a card that says
how much you love and appreciate me.

577
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:35,427
There are four days a year
where you can get a card like that.

578
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:37,344
Today was one.

579
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:40,848
Can't really put
your crumpled-up wrapping paper

580
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,726
in my card drawer, can I? I can't.

581
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,686
You have a card drawer?

582
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:48,188
You know I have a card drawer,
you little snoop.

583
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:50,108
Whoops.

584
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:53,111
I'm sorry I'm asking you this so late.

585
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:57,573
But, Joanne, what would you like to do
for your final hours of Valentine's Day?

586
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:59,366
- Oh.
- Yeah.

587
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:02,329
- You sure you're ready to hear it?
- Yeah, this is your time.

588
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,333
I wanna get in this bed,
turn on <i>Love is Blind,</i>

589
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,043
and watch it

590
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,671
alone, by myself.

591
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:14,507
Is that okay?

592
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:16,885
Yeah.

593
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:18,594
- You sure?
- It's fine.

594
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,889
No! No, no, no, no, no, no!

595
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,224
All right.

596
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,352
It's your day.

597
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:28,520
Joanne.

598
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:30,982
All right. I'm here if you need me.

599
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:32,734
Thank you.

600
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:43,869
<i>This is crazy.</i>

601
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,120
<i>- This is crazy.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

602
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:47,831
<i>Did you think we'd be sitting here
five days ago?</i>

603
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:48,749
<i>No.</i>

604
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,419
I have a good feeling about
these two. They're gonna last.

605
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:53,213
<i>Same.</i>

606
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:54,963
<i>How's the ring?</i>

607
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:57,467
<i>- I'm obsessed with it.
- What is this?</i>

608
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:05,141
- That was a short episode.
- I turned it off.

609
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,185
Okay.

610
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,229
And

611
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:11,981
I wrote you a card.

612
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,316
You wrote me a card.

613
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:15,235
Mm-hmm.

614
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,946
<i>For worse or for better</i>

615
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,700
<i>Oh, baby...</i>

616
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:24,869
A lot of spelling errors in here, huh?

617
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,829
I love it.

618
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,164
<i>Faded</i>

619
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:31,834
<i>Slipping right between your teeth</i>

620
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:35,129
<i>Maybe it's stupid, maybe it's reckless</i>

621
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:38,048
<i>Send me a message anyway</i>

622
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:41,468
<i>I fall in love in 30 seconds</i>

623
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:44,304
<i>Sudden rushes to the brain</i>

624
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:45,806
<i>And that's okay</i>

625
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,808
<i>I say for sure</i>

626
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:50,811
<i>I was reminded that this ain't war</i>

627
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:53,814
<i>And I can fight it, but we shall see</i>

628
00:28:53,815 --> 00:29:00,821
<i>I can't keep loving you more than me</i>

629
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:04,826
<i>Loving you more than me</i>

630
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:10,330
<i>I love you forever</i>

631
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:13,417
<i>Maybe it's stupid, maybe it's reckless</i>

632
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:16,336
<i>Send me a message anyway</i>

633
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:19,965
<i>I fall in love in 30 seconds</i>

634
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:22,927
<i>Sudden rushes to the brain</i>

635
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:27,598
<i>- I say for sure
- Nobody told you</i>

636
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,349
<i>This ain't war</i>

637
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,102
<i>Love you forever</i>
