1
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:17,224
<i>You said your phone was broken
Just forgot to charge it</i>

2
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:19,601
<i>Whole outfit you're wearing, God I...</i>

3
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:21,478
I'm so excited for our parents to meet.

4
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:25,357
Me too. I just hope mine don't undo
the weeks' worth of work I've done

5
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:26,400
with Bina at <i>Shabbat.</i>

6
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,861
Really seems like you've
worked your way up to cordial.

7
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:31,905
More than cordial. Did I not tell you
she butt-dialed me the other day?

8
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:34,575
- No.
- Yes. I was like, "I know you wanna talk."

9
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:36,161
I invented that move.

10
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:39,580
- Ooh. Is this the vibe?
- Oh.

11
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,750
Or should the costumes
be <i>Purim-</i> themed?

12
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,544
Unrelated, remind me
what the <i>Purim</i> theme is.

13
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:48,422
Simply put,
<i>Purim</i> is the celebration of Queen Esther,

14
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:51,300
who saved the Jews from this evil guy
Haman's plot to destroy them.

15
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,801
Okay, clearly I'm gonna be her.

16
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:55,346
You can do that. Just know
that Esther goes as her every year.

17
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:57,264
Then definitely not.

18
00:00:57,265 --> 00:01:00,684
I literally just got her to change me
in her phone from Ho-Anne, so...

19
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:02,686
Well, you can also go as your shadow self.

20
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:04,772
The part of you that's not visible
most of the time.

21
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:07,274
Uh, all parts of me are visible
at all times.

22
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:08,734
I'm not mysterious, Noah.

23
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,487
Listen, don't stress about the costume.
<i>Purim's</i> fun, okay?

24
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:15,949
The idea is that anything can happen,
and what's hidden might become revealed.

25
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,660
Sounding very <i>Eyes Wide Shut.</i>
Like, what's revealed?

26
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:21,163
I'd say it's less orgy
than you're thinking

27
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,456
and more personal insight.

28
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:25,501
You know, sometimes
people feel more themselves on <i>Purim</i>,

29
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,002
or more connected to Judaism.

30
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:32,299
Sometimes people even discover Judaism
within themselves for the very first time.

31
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,594
So what's hidden
becomes revealed, you see.

32
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,097
I get it.

33
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:38,556
I get it.

34
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,726
- You want me to wear a crop top?
- I always want you to wear a crop top.

35
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:46,605
<i>Manchild</i>

36
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,941
<i>Why you always come a-running...</i>

37
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,317
Chinese for dinner?

38
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:52,903
I know I said I'd stop suggesting
that place that made us sick,

39
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:55,405
but I'm just gonna say it.
I am ready to go back.

40
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:56,407
Respect.

41
00:01:56,908 --> 00:02:01,120
Um, I'm starting to get a bit nervous
about my interview at the temple tomorrow.

42
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,871
I just wanna go home and prepare.

43
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:06,291
Okay, we can order in.
I'll watch <i>Felicity</i> while you work.

44
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,460
Yeah, I'm not too hungry, actually.

45
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,839
Wanna just maybe read up
on Temple Ahava in bed and crash.

46
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,592
Really want a good night's sleep
before my interview, so

47
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,677
maybe we could take a night off?

48
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,888
- A night off?
- If that's okay.

49
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:21,724
A night... off?

50
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,226
Yeah.

51
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,103
Sure. Uh, sure.

52
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,438
- Okay.
- Sure.

53
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,900
- Okay, thank you.
- Yeah.

54
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:34,612
- I love you.
- Okay. Uh, I love you too.

55
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:42,494
<i>He gave me pretty flowers</i>

56
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,956
<i>And I gave him empty threats</i>

57
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:47,709
<i>I was afraid of falling</i>

58
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,210
<i>But now he's my safety net</i>

59
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:55,007
<i>Chasing dead ends
Was the way I survived</i>

60
00:02:55,008 --> 00:03:00,929
<i>But if that's how I'd find him
Then I'd do it twice</i>

61
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:05,726
<i>Now we just think
Of the time that we lose</i>

62
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,604
<i>If we don't try to jump in the line</i>

63
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,105
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

64
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:11,982
<i>'Cause I used to tell him</i>

65
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:14,027
<i>"No, no, no, no, no"</i>

66
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,404
<i>When he asked me out</i>

67
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,532
<i>Then I said, "Fine, let's go"</i>

68
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,202
<i>Then he never left my house</i>

69
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,997
<i>He's lived in my mind</i>

70
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,542
<i>Even before I</i>

71
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:33,378
<i>Before I ever knew</i>

72
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:38,967
<i>Now we just follow the signs
Not the rules</i>

73
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,886
<i>How exactly did he phrase it?</i>

74
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:44,890
He said he needs a good night's sleep
before the interview.

75
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,392
He's worried you're gonna
keep him up all night?

76
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:50,979
You're tiny. It's like having a doll
in the bed that smells like Le Labo.

77
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:51,897
I know.

78
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,275
Things have been going so smoothly.

79
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:57,569
Minus one little bump
about the conversion thing.

80
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,198
Like, he was explaining
that part of <i>Purim</i> is this idea

81
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,659
that what was once hidden is now revealed.

82
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,037
And I guess I knew
he was talking about conversion,

83
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:10,582
and I made some stupid joke
about, like, a crop top.

84
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,876
And he went with it,
and I thought it was fine,

85
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:15,254
but then now he's asking for a night off.

86
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,797
And I'm worried

87
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,008
maybe he doesn't think I'm serious
about the conversion thing anymore?

88
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:22,219
I don't know, but I have to yawn.

89
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,804
I think I can help.

90
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:27,058
I've seen this kind of thing
in my couples' therapy sessions.

91
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,185
You have? Feels pretty specific.

92
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:31,603
Oh, come on, shh, Joanne.

93
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,939
Just let him work. He's very good.

94
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,775
I actually think this is a good thing.

95
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:37,609
Really?

96
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:41,405
Noah asking for a night off
is a sign that you're with someone

97
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,824
who's honestly communicating their needs.

98
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,868
- Mm. I love that.
- Mm.

99
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:49,162
I know. I'm happy
that he's telling me what he wants,

100
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:52,291
but what if the reason he wants it
is, like, really, really bad?

101
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,752
Yeah. Well, I guess you're doomed.

102
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,717
Ow! Joanne?

103
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,428
So how did you start Temple Ahava?

104
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,847
Yeah, I was actually raised
very conservative,

105
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,557
but it wasn't until I found Ahava

106
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,393
that I was really able
to discover my voice as a rabbi.

107
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,352
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

108
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,855
What was it about Ahava,
if you don't mind me asking?

109
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:18,442
I can't pretend anymore. I'm...
I'm fangirling right now a little bit.

110
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:21,737
I... I... I love you, man.
I... I love your work so much.

111
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,155
- Really? Come on.
- Yeah. No.

112
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:26,742
I saw the sermon you gave at <i>Tu BiShvat</i>
at Temple Chai a few years back.

113
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:27,701
It blew my mind.

114
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,494
- It changed the way I mourn.
- My gosh.

115
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,372
I was mourning all wrong.
We got you on our vision board here.

116
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:33,915
- Goodness.
- You're the hot rabbi!

117
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,584
Stop it. That's so nice to say.

118
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,337
So you were saying
that you grew up conservative.

119
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,088
Yes. My parents were very strict.

120
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,506
Honestly, kind of dicks.

121
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:45,260
Every fun party in high school is
on a Friday night. I never got to do shit.

122
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,304
- You know. Such a bummer!
- I know. Yes.

123
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:50,599
I never watched <i>TGIF.</i>
Didn't know who Urkel was till I was 30.

124
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,227
But here, I found a community where we can
take the words that were given to us

125
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:57,481
thousands of years ago very seriously,
but at the same time,

126
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,733
we can expand on them
to fit modern ideals.

127
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,193
That's really interesting.

128
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:05,655
I mean, you know, full disclosure,
the words are... very important to me.

129
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:08,367
Are you kidding me?
They're the best words.

130
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,452
Thank you.

131
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:11,495
You're welcome.

132
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,913
Yeah. No, I love the words,

133
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,957
but it doesn't mean we gotta be
weird about 'em. Know what I mean?

134
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,960
- Sure.
- Like, for example, my wife, not Jewish.

135
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:22,339
Very not Jewish.
But she's an active member of the temple.

136
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,800
She can't make <i>challah</i> for shit.
Can't even say <i>challah.</i>

137
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,551
You gotta hit the <i>cha.</i> She's got no <i>cha.</i>

138
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:29,805
She butchers the word.
She says <i>challah.</i> Like, holla!

139
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,224
But still, everyone loves her around here.

140
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,850
I know someone who can't hit the <i>cha.</i>

141
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:36,937
The reason, and not to get too personal,
that I left Temple Chai

142
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,772
is because my girlfriend isn't Jewish.

143
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,148
- Look at us.
- What?

144
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:42,526
- Two peas in a pod. Are you kidding me?
- Wow.

145
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:45,947
Please get personal.
How's the sex? Tell me everything.

146
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,949
Kidding. You don't have to answer.

147
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:52,411
I'm just saying, here at Ahava,
you would both be very welcome.

148
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,412
That's so good to hear.

149
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,248
I mean, listen, the hope is
eventually she'll wanna convert,

150
00:06:56,249 --> 00:07:00,001
but I love the idea of a temple that
doesn't put a timetable on her process.

151
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:04,047
Look, this is going very well, I think.
We're fans. You were on our vision board.

152
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:07,134
I mean, we would love to have you here.

153
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,219
If you will "Ahava" us.

154
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,388
Get it?

155
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,057
What do you say?

156
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:14,975
<i>Do my ladies...</i>

157
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:15,934
I...

158
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:19,354
<i>- Do my, do my ladies run this?
- Yo, yo, yo, yo</i>

159
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,773
<i>All of my girls looking good
And they got their own money</i>

160
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:22,691
<i>Pop your shit</i>

161
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,193
<i>This for my girls with no sponsor
Got their own funding</i>

162
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:26,111
<i>Not your shit</i>

163
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,779
<i>Run through your city, that motorcade</i>

164
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,072
Looking good, Noah.

165
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:33,285
Hey, there he is! Yep.
I'm not always Mr. Nice Guy, you know?

166
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,454
Sometimes I have a little bite.

167
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,373
Uh, a bit of a bad boy, if you...

168
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:41,626
Hey, Sharon, please do not
lean your chair back like that.

169
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:42,669
You could fall.

170
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:48,550
My princess, come to me, come.
Oh, you look delectable.

171
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:51,178
- Thank you.
- Where you been? Thought you'd be early.

172
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,138
I have a very full life, Noah.

173
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,055
Of course.

174
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:57,226
Um, how was your night's sleep without me?

175
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,271
Are you mad about the night off?

176
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,273
No.

177
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:05,275
I can't believe you're mad.
It was just one night.

178
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:08,945
It's fine. It's whatever. I have
a lot of bobby pins in my head. Like 60.

179
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:13,242
Okay. Hey, uh, my parents are gonna be
here any minute. What's the ETA on yours?

180
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,744
My mom texted the family group chat,

181
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,871
"Your dad won't
come out of the closet again!"

182
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,248
So wherever they are,
they're having fun with it.

183
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:21,333
All right.

184
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,419
- Will you tell me about your interview?
- Yeah, it went really...

185
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,214
Uh, one sec. I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.

186
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,341
Whoa, wait. All right.
First of all, you could choke.

187
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:33,637
Second of all, let's just put these...
These go here. And then...

188
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,430
- <i>With an old friend
- Old friend</i>

189
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:37,474
<i>But it's like
I've never seen you before...</i>

190
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,267
Tried to get my dad to dress similar

191
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:42,646
so we could lean into the cutthroat
gangster vibe that we have at work.

192
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,606
That's not how I see your job at all.

193
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:47,025
You're not coming by the office
a lot, are you, Dave?

194
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,612
<i>I was busy watching your lips</i>

195
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,279
<i>Have you always had...</i>

196
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,948
Hi, honey.

197
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,200
- Mom, what are you wearing?
- I think it's fun.

198
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,826
- Well, I don't.
- Okay.

199
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,871
<i>Drives me wild, tell me...</i>

200
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:00,790
Oh, hi.

201
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,833
Oh shit.

202
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:06,754
Oh, now I know why
you wanted to ride separately. Okay.

203
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,549
- I can't believe you're not Queen Esther.
- I can't believe you don't like it.

204
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,342
- No! No, I love it.
- Oh. Okay.

205
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,761
It's like the sexiest break
from tradition ever.

206
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:17,806
Yeah, I thought about it.
Then I realized I don't wanna be Esther.

207
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,266
I wanna be sexy cat.

208
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,518
Okay.

209
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,812
Maybe I should've been Batman.
We would've matched.

210
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:28,024
Might be a little bit too close to
my everyday self though. I was very brave.

211
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:30,528
- I don't like that. Yeah.
- No, okay. No, I was very brave.

212
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,577
- Looking forward to this, you know?
- Okay.

213
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:42,247
Mom, Dad, looking great as always.

214
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,499
My favorite vampire.

215
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,794
- Yes, yes, let's get you a drink. Come on.
- Yes. Great.

216
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:50,130
Are you excited to meet Joanne's parents?

217
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,548
Oh, my darling.

218
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,883
I don't understand
why I have to meet these people

219
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:56,136
if they are not going to be
in our lives long-term.

220
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,972
And what's more,
unless something has changed,

221
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:02,309
you still don't even know
if Joanne is going to convert.

222
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:06,229
Pooh, pooh, pooh. They are gonna be
in your lives long-term. Joanne.

223
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,023
- Joanne, honey.
- Yes.

224
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,983
- There she is.
- Oh, hi.

225
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,276
- Hi.
- Mwah.

226
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,193
Hi.

227
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,529
Hi, darling.

228
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,239
Bina, this outfit is iconic.

229
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,907
Queen Elizabeth II.

230
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:20,870
The longest-reigning queen in history.

231
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:22,705
Message received.

232
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:25,041
Joanne, what do you think, huh?

233
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,709
- I am...
- It's... You are...

234
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,211
- The evil Haman!
- The evil Haman!

235
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,422
Yes.

236
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,592
You're supposed to get really drunk
at these things?

237
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,219
Oh, sure, yeah. One year Noah cried, yeah.

238
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,929
When he drinks,
he gets a little emotional.

239
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,682
Me? You.
You're gonna be weeping like a baby.

240
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:46,186
Listen, before Joanne's parents get here,
I have something I'd like to share.

241
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,104
I have a bit of news.

242
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:51,900
You're looking at the newest senior rabbi
of Temple Ahava.

243
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,943
- Oh my God! You got the job?
- I did.

244
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:56,863
- Why didn't you say anything?
- I wanted to tell you together.

245
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,324
- Noah.
- <i>Mazel tov.</i>

246
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:02,702
- <i>Mazel tov.</i> I'm so proud of you.
- Yeah. Look who's crying now.

247
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:06,790
Noah, what kind of a temple offers a job
to someone after only one interview?

248
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,625
The kind that doesn't wanna miss out.

249
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:09,626
I was surprised, too,

250
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,420
but they're less adherent
to a traditional process there.

251
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:15,674
- It seems to really work for 'em.
- They know a star when they see one.

252
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,218
Look, I know it's more progressive
than you're used to,

253
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,596
but I think it's gonna be
the right place for me.

254
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:23,724
A woman from my bank goes to Temple Ahava.

255
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,976
Her hair is always a mess.

256
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:31,356
<i>Close my eyes
Let my imagination go</i>

257
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,233
<i>Watch dandelions blow...</i>

258
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:35,527
Okay, I don't see anyone I know here.

259
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,904
Should we just, like, leave, or...

260
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,280
Morgan, we just got here.

261
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,324
Took me an hour and a half
to get into this.

262
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:44,452
Hey, guys. Oh, 45 minutes late. Not bad.

263
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:45,620
Ooh, Jell-O shots!

264
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:48,707
Last time I had one of these,
I sang every song from <i>Mamma Mia.</i>

265
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,999
Cool, Dad.

266
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,376
- Morgan!
- Mm.

267
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:56,131
Wow. You came dressed as a hooker with
my boyfriend's entire family here. Lovely.

268
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,340
It's actually sex worker.

269
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:00,760
Everyone knows the only couple's costume
worth doing is <i>Pretty Woman.</i>

270
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:01,970
Yeah.

271
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,639
- Let's go get a real drink, yeah?
- Yes, Julia.

272
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,183
So, Joanne, I did some <i>Purim</i> Googling.

273
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,978
It turns out that Queen Esther
is the hero of the story,

274
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,646
so I thought it'd be a perfect fit.

275
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:15,108
Naturally. Yep, and, Mom, you look insane.

276
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:18,653
Thank you, sweetie.
Jewish Halloween, so fun.

277
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:19,904
You can't call it that.

278
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,531
So where are my future in-laws?

279
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,324
Wow. Uh, maybe don't say that.

280
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,034
Honey, relax.

281
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:27,495
You're making way too much
of this night off.

282
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:31,124
Your father and I used to take nights off
from each other all the time.

283
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,877
He loved having his guys' nights
to blow off steam.

284
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,879
I never took it personally.

285
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,091
And some of the time, they really were
just poker nights or whatever.

286
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,134
Lynn and Henry Williams,

287
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:44,471
please meet my parents,
Bina and Ilan Roklov.

288
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:47,056
It is so lovely to meet you.

289
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:48,683
Nice to meet you. Nice to...

290
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:50,018
Who's booing? How rude.

291
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:53,104
Ah, it's customary to boo
anybody dressed as Haman.

292
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,482
He's the villain of the story. That's me.

293
00:12:55,483 --> 00:13:00,487
Well, you've raised a wonderful son.
He's such a gentleman. Always pays.

294
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:03,282
Thank you. I taught him that.

295
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:08,745
And you have raised a daughter
that has come into our lives.

296
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,079
Just like we taught her.

297
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,832
Mm, that's my girl.

298
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,503
Who needs a drink?

299
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,172
I do. Mine spilled in the car.

300
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:20,965
Straight over there.

301
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:21,925
Ooh.

302
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,094
- Right there.
- It's okay.

303
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,847
Okay. I think that went well.
I mean, I did come into your lives.

304
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,016
Yeah, I thought it would be a bigger deal.

305
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:33,019
You expect them to book a cruise together
the second they're introduced?

306
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,896
Anyway, we have bigger things to discuss.

307
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:38,441
- Noah, the job. This is huge.
- Oh, yeah. Okay, all right.

308
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:42,070
So the interview went great,
and this temple, it's stunning.

309
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,947
I'm gonna tell you
all about it later, okay?

310
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,907
Oh, are we going home together?

311
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:48,619
Yes, of course. I mean, if you want to.

312
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,079
- Do you want to?
- Come on.

313
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,121
- Noah!
- Hey.

314
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:54,123
I didn't... I didn't
ask for two nights off.

315
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,291
Well, I'll think about it.

316
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:56,960
- Have you met my friend Dave?
- Hey.

317
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,169
I've seen you around.

318
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,671
- You spent time at Temple Chai.
- Mom!

319
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:00,880
Yeah, of course I have.

320
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:03,216
Hey, can I get a virgin sparkling water?

321
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,426
- Hey.
- Hi, how's it going? What's up?

322
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:07,387
Why are you dressed like Michael Bublé?

323
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:10,182
I'm not dressed like Michael Bublé.
He doesn't even...

324
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,642
- Whatever. He's cool.
- Yeah.

325
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:14,103
Hey, where's your, uh...

326
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,896
Where's your therapist?

327
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,860
Uh, my boyfriend is over there helping
my dad with his wig cap.

328
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,113
- Get you a man who can do both.
- Mm.

329
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:25,989
How's it going with him?

330
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,907
Not to be annoying,

331
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:31,411
but the past month of living with him
has been one of the best in my life.

332
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,954
Jesus, you're in deep.

333
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:33,956
Yeah.

334
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,083
- All right. I'm gonna go talk to him.
- Oh.

335
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:39,419
Just make sure we can trust him.

336
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,461
Let Daddy handle this.

337
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:43,172
Ew. Never call yourself Daddy
in front of me again.

338
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:44,592
- Okay, Mama.
- Ew!

339
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,638
- Hi. Thank you.
- I never took you for a princess type.

340
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,599
- I told you, it's my shadow self.
- Mm.

341
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,893
Tradwife material, you know?

342
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:58,813
Plus, if I'm gonna have my revelation,
then I might as well look the part.

343
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,773
Have you ever seen <i>Cinderella?</i>

344
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:03,359
A girl from a broken home
wants to marry a prince after one date.

345
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,528
Actually, that fits. Very you.

346
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:07,197
That is so not me.

347
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:11,826
So when do you think you'll be Jewish?
Like half hour? 45?

348
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:14,579
The night is young.
Plenty of opportunities to feel it.

349
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,331
God, you guys move slow.

350
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:19,334
I feel so lucky that Andy and I
don't have those kinds of issues.

351
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:22,795
Yeah, just your classic, healthy,
no-red-flags-whatsoever relationship.

352
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:23,714
Mm-hmm.

353
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,383
It's true.

354
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,344
So true.

355
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,889
- Oh, Bina!
- Oh! Hello, dear.

356
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,851
- You look nice.
- And you... You look, uh... Uh... Uh...

357
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:39,312
What? Uh, no... No Queen Esther this year?

358
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:43,024
No, I was changing it up.
I thought this would be cute and funny.

359
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,736
So Esther does not want to be Esther?

360
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:47,196
That is funny.

361
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,448
Listen to me, dear.

362
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,826
I will not say anything to my son,
but between you and me,

363
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,663
I know there is a problem in your house.

364
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,961
I just love that Joanne is with a rabbi.

365
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:06,673
You know, I consider myself
on a lifelong spiritual journey.

366
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:07,590
Yeah?

367
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:11,302
I feel like my soul has had
a thousand different lives, you know?

368
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,179
Yeah, I think I do, actually.

369
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,516
I also believe our souls have memories
beyond our consciousness.

370
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,602
You know, in Judaism,
there's this belief around Mount Sinai.

371
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:22,063
It's said every Jewish soul,
past, present, and future,

372
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,232
was all there together
for the giving of the Torah.

373
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:27,151
So whether you were born yesterday
or hundreds of years ago,

374
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,112
we were all on the mountain together.
And to me...

375
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,698
Oh my God!

376
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,116
I was there.

377
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,493
I was on the mountain!

378
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,954
I feel it so deeply!

379
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,373
Okay. What... What are you saying?

380
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,251
I'm Jewish!

381
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,170
- You sure it's not the wine?
- No!

382
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,591
It's the truest feeling I've ever had!
I was there!

383
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,092
I'm Jewish!

384
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:54,429
Wow. I have never gotten this reaction
to that story before.

385
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,640
- Oh my God!
- <i>Mazel tov!</i>

386
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:58,934
- Hi. Oh.
- Hey.

387
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,477
What's wrong?
Are you having a heart attack?

388
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:04,105
- Is it the weight of your boobs?
- I've never been better.

389
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,525
I'm finally myself!

390
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,735
I'm Jewish!

391
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:11,070
- Mom, that's not a funny joke.
- I'm not joking.

392
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:13,990
I just had an epiphany.
I mean, <i>the</i> epiphany.

393
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,992
I've been Jewish my whole life.

394
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,411
- And beyond!
- What?

395
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,747
I think your mom
is having a spiritual awakening.

396
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:23,541
You promised you would stop copying us.
That's Joanne's thing.

397
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:27,296
I'm not copying anyone!
I was there on the mountain.

398
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,591
And to be honest, I didn't see you.

399
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,133
Oof.

400
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,551
What is happening right now?

401
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:37,055
I just love that I figured this out
on Jewish Halloween!

402
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,557
- Mom!
- It's okay. A lot of Jews call it that.

403
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,393
Whoo!

404
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:46,105
This is insane. My mom is always insane,
but this is next-level.

405
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,690
- Well, actually...
- I'm so sorry.

406
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,525
This is like
when she got certified in Reiki

407
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:52,320
and she'd hover her hands
over people at the grocery store.

408
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:55,532
- I don't know if it's like that.
- What do you mean?

409
00:17:56,241 --> 00:18:00,119
I'm open to this being real for her.
It's <i>Purim</i>. This kind of thing happens.

410
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,498
Yes, Noah,
you've made me well aware of that.

411
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:06,292
Hey, look, just 'cause she feels this way
doesn't change anything.

412
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:08,669
- It might be nice.
- She doesn't stick with things!

413
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,046
That's okay. That's okay.

414
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,673
She might realize that
as soon as she starts the process.

415
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:14,926
That's what conversion courses are for.

416
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,762
As a rabbi,
I'm supposed to honor her conviction.

417
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,182
We can see where it leads.
Is that okay with you?

418
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:26,104
I don't know what to say.
'Cause you seem, like, excited about this.

419
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:30,776
Yeah, anytime anyone connects deeply
to Judaism, it is... It is exciting to me.

420
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,451
Let's just go back to the party.

421
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:42,454
- <i>Mazel tov!</i>
- Oh yeah!

422
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:44,581
Oh wow!

423
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:46,582
So tell me everything.

424
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,335
What exactly happens on <i>Yom Kippur?</i>

425
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:51,839
Well, for starters, uh,

426
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:53,340
nothing fun.

427
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:57,844
You're a riot! I love my new religion.

428
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:00,638
Bina, your whole thing is fab.

429
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,515
Hair, dress, sash.

430
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:03,684
Were you a model?

431
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,979
No. You're just trying
to get on my good side.

432
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,021
Maybe.

433
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:11,190
It might be working.

434
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:12,275
You tell the story!

435
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,777
We both played Kenickie in <i>Grease</i>
in high school.

436
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:17,029
Same year, only three states away.

437
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,657
We could've gone
to see each other's shows had we known.

438
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:20,825
That's crazy!

439
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,035
- We have so much in common!
- We have so much in common!

440
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:24,579
Whoa!

441
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,165
I have to hit the little boys' room.
I'll be right back.

442
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,585
I hope you don't have a best friend.
I'm gunning for that number one spot.

443
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:31,836
"Your mother"!

444
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:32,879
Isn't he great?

445
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,963
- I love him.
- I know.

446
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,632
We both have distant fathers.
He cracked my back.

447
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,718
- Oh my God.
- He's got a secret deodorant.

448
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,344
He's gonna send me a link.

449
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,054
You guys are so cute already!

450
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:43,264
I know. I really do.

451
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:46,100
Like, he smells fantastic.
I got right in there.

452
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:48,811
My sister has no boundaries.
Do you want me to break it up?

453
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:51,607
Honestly, it... it doesn't even bother me.

454
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:52,983
Really?

455
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,777
I'm as shocked as you are,
I gotta tell ya.

456
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,071
Your mom!

457
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:01,950
You're sure I'm not
on the mountain? You really looked?

458
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:03,534
I can check again.

459
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:07,413
Her conversion's the talk of the party.
You're one step closer to being Jewish.

460
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,750
And yet I feel further away than ever.

461
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,459
Really? Why?

462
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:15,254
'Cause I've been experiencing
these Jewish rituals for months now.

463
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,380
- And I love them.
- Mm.

464
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:19,258
But I also love
what I know about Buddhism.

465
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,302
Except for their stance on forgiveness.

466
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,304
And I had a great time
at Burning Man once.

467
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,680
Does that make me a burner?

468
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:27,767
Noah said
I have to want to convert for myself.

469
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:31,772
And whatever that feeling is,
I just haven't had it yet.

470
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:36,568
Hoped maybe it would be revealed today,
like Noah said, but...

471
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,031
Well, I guess it was, just for my mother.

472
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:45,410
Look at her. I don't know.
Maybe you should just fake it?

473
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,162
- What?
- Just fake it.

474
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:50,456
- Pretend you're feeling the feeling.
- I can't do that.

475
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:53,334
You're already doing <i>Shabbat.</i>
It's like half of the way there.

476
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:57,089
Even if I wanted to, Noah and I
don't have that kind of relationship.

477
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,841
Okay.

478
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:07,432
Oh my God, stop it!

479
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,439
<i>Ooh...</i>

480
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,153
Hey. You know, your costume doesn't
really work as your shadow self, 'cause

481
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,863
you're a princess to me every day.

482
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:25,116
Thanks. It's kind of itchy.

483
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,326
Okay. That was a pretty cheesy line.

484
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:29,371
You didn't give me any shit for it.

485
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:32,624
You still upset? What's going on?

486
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:38,463
I guess I just thought
today would be special.

487
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,965
It is special.
Just 'cause your mom is having...

488
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,009
It's not about my mom. It's...

489
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,303
It's about how the whole thing went down.

490
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:48,597
Of course I wanted
to feel something today,

491
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:50,599
but then you said you needed a night off.

492
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,935
Right after you mentioned conversion,
a night off,

493
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:54,812
like you needed a break
from this whole thing.

494
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,106
And it just...

495
00:21:56,982 --> 00:22:00,901
It made me feel
like you don't have any faith in me.

496
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:03,612
I didn't realize it bothered you so much.
Come here. Come here.

497
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:05,156
I promise you,

498
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,658
there was no deeper meaning
to the night off, okay?

499
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,118
I thought I needed it to prep

500
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,871
because that's what I've always done
before interviews.

501
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:14,374
And I have complete faith in you

502
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,794
to feel or not feel
whatever is right for you.

503
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,464
- Really?
- Yes, really.

504
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:25,426
You don't mind that I didn't have some
big spiritual epiphany like my mom did?

505
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:26,969
No, not at all.

506
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,721
I love you, okay?

507
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:31,891
I slept way, way fucking worse
without you.

508
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,018
- You did?
- Yes. It was terrible.

509
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,771
I'm so happy to hear that.

510
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,523
Okay, but listen, um,

511
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,150
if this ever comes up again...

512
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:43,569
- Mm-hmm.
- You can't say you need a night off.

513
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:47,699
- Okay.
- You may request a sad night away.

514
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,076
- A sad night away?
- Yes.

515
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:50,994
Got it.

516
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:53,497
I love you too.

517
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:56,457
There's one more thing I gotta do

518
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,584
before we can get outta here
and talk about everybody.

519
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,462
That's my favorite part of any party.

520
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:06,301
- Do you take...
- I don't.

521
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,137
- He's gotta... say something.
- Come on. Yep.

522
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:13,057
Really quick.
I normally tell the <i>Purim</i> story.

523
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,892
Uh, I'm not gonna do that tonight.

524
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:17,978
I'm gonna spare you
'cause you're too drunk to care. I know.

525
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:20,941
I'm just gonna briefly say
that I do think,

526
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:25,194
in part, <i>Purim</i> reminds us
that everything we think we know

527
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:27,696
can be turned upside down in an instant.

528
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:31,867
We have no idea
what is gonna happen in our lifetimes.

529
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,411
The possibilities are endless.

530
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:38,124
And yes, it can be scary, but I think
it can also be exciting, right?

531
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,209
- Yes.
- I mean...

532
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:44,506
Sometimes, the best things in our life
are those that we didn't plan for.

533
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,930
So that's it.

534
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,932
<i>Mazel,</i> everyone. Thank you for coming.

535
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,101
<i>- Mazel.
- Mazel.</i>

536
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,103
Okay, let's go home.

537
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,021
I'm sorry. You know what?

538
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,859
Do you mind if I have,
like, a quick couple of words?

539
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,526
- Uh...
- No.

540
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,361
No. I... Yeah, sure.

541
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:10,948
Hi, I know I don't know many of you here,
but I'm with the Joanne bunch.

542
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,700
- Yeah!
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!

543
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,577
- This is my nightmare.
- Okay.

544
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:18,873
Noah, your speech, it inspired
a... a bit of a revelation inside me,

545
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,375
and I... I really have to share this.

546
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:23,669
- "Greased Lightnin'!"
- "Go Greased Lightnin'"!

547
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,880
"Your mother. Your mother."

548
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,174
This is my guy.

549
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:31,802
Although we've only been dating
for, uh, a short time,

550
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:35,931
I have had the privilege
of falling in love with this woman.

551
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:39,685
I have had the privilege
of falling in love with you, Morgan.

552
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:42,354
And I don't know why I'm feeling this way,

553
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:43,482
but I just feel

554
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:47,860
that I never wanna have a night off
from you ever in my life.

555
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,654
- Oh!
- Okay.

556
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:52,656
Morgan?

557
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,743
Oh. Oh!

558
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,578
Mm-mm. No.

559
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:58,746
Will you marry me?

560
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:01,333
Aw.

561
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:03,918
- Yes! Yes!
- Yes? Yes.

562
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,837
One thousand times, yes!

563
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,173
I love you! I love you!

564
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:11,717
Oh my God!
Oh my God, we're getting married!

565
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:13,386
This is crazy!

566
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:17,516
This is crazy.

567
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:21,603
- Oh, Morgan!
- <i>Mazel tov.</i>

568
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,814
Oh my God!

569
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:35,367
<i>Stripped to the waist
We fall into the river</i>

570
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:44,626
<i>Cover your eyes
So you don't know the secret</i>

571
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:49,129
<i>I've been trying to hide</i>

572
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:54,219
<i>We held our breath
To see our names are written</i>

573
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,639
<i>On the wreck of '86</i>

574
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,144
<i>That was the year
I knew the panic was over</i>

575
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,148
<i>Yeah, since we found out</i>

576
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:10,150
<i>Since we found out</i>

577
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:13,153
<i>That anything could happen</i>

578
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:15,155
<i>Anything could happen</i>

579
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:19,910
<i>Anything could happen
Anything could happen</i>

580
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:22,413
<i>Anything could happen</i>

581
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:26,167
<i>Anything could happen
Anything could</i>
