1
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:10,050
<i>My heart beats fast
When you're speaking</i>

2
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:13,429
<i>Your words cut me to pieces</i>

3
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,890
<i>Now we're what, wait, what?</i>

4
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:20,769
<i>My heart beats fast when you're speaking
Your words...</i>

5
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,022
- No. She did not say that?
- What?

6
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,315
You told Morgan
her relationship was moving fast,

7
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:27,234
and she said, "When you know, you know"?

8
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:28,944
Yeah, is that a weird thing to say?

9
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:32,364
Yes! I hate it when people say,
"When you know, you know."

10
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:33,449
I think it's disgusting.

11
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,577
I'm not in love with how
their relationship started, but I mean,

12
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:39,705
I can be open to people
knowing when they know, right?

13
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,749
No. Sorry, you can't.

14
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,667
But we know we know about us.

15
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:48,088
Yeah, but we don't
go around saying it, right?

16
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:50,175
It's like saying, um,

17
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:53,385
"I know something
that you couldn't possibly know."

18
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:56,388
"I have something
you couldn't possibly understand."

19
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,807
But between you and I,
I do feel that way about us.

20
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:02,895
Of course, but we know better
than to say it out loud.

21
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,730
Okay, exactly, except to each other.

22
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:05,732
That's right.

23
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:09,234
Can't believe I have to go
wedding dress shopping with her today.

24
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,570
Could there be anything more insane?

25
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:15,449
Um, however you feel about this...
is how I feel.

26
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,576
Correct.

27
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:19,037
Thank you.

28
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:24,875
Not gonna eat anything before you go?

29
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:27,503
Oh no. First day of a new job,
I couldn't eat a thing.

30
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:30,714
- Mm.
- Very, very, very excited about Ahava.

31
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:33,967
I feel like a progressive temple
could be exactly what I need.

32
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:37,930
Maybe the way you know you know about us
is the way you know you know about Ahava.

33
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:42,267
I'm hoping. I'm really hoping because
this might be the perfect solution for me.

34
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,979
And by me, I mean us.

35
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:57,116
I mean, I don't love being the second
non-Jewish rabbi's wife at that temple,

36
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,619
but I'll accept it.

37
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,996
Let's just hope she's not blonde.

38
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:08,085
I don't even think it's what Morgan wants.
I think it's what Dr. Andy wants.

39
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,419
How do you know?

40
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,174
She's my sister. I can feel
what she feels before she feels it.

41
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,218
Yeah, but what's your evidence?

42
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:17,554
Feelings are evidence.

43
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:20,013
- Don't worry, I have a plan.
<i>- Oy.</i>

44
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:23,767
I am going to make her realize
she doesn't know what she knows.

45
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,728
- Can I be the voice of reason here?
- No.

46
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:32,527
Hey, have a great first
"rabbi at the new temple" day. Mm.

47
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:35,779
Have a great
"ruining wedding dress shopping" day.

48
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,697
I will.

49
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:39,783
<i>My heart beats fast
When you're speaking</i>

50
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:42,911
<i>Your words cut me to pieces</i>

51
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:45,998
We like to keep things loose
at Ahava. We don't like rules.

52
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,208
Religion should be expansive,
not restrictive.

53
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:51,170
Exactly. Our congregation is religious,
don't get me wrong.

54
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,213
We just kind of have
a more modern approach.

55
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:56,341
Like, I don't drive on <i>Shabbat,</i>
but if my mom's in the hospital,

56
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,969
I'm not walking to Pasadena
to prove a point. Know what I mean?

57
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,930
I think rigidity
doesn't bring you closer to God.

58
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:04,558
Know what brings you
closer to God? Having an open heart.

59
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:05,726
Exactly.

60
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,520
We wanna open it up
to as many people as possible, you know?

61
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:11,481
We want more Jews, not less.
We're trying to put asses in seats.

62
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:13,692
And you don't do that by telling people

63
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,028
that they can't marry
the hot blonde they met at Coachella.

64
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:16,945
Yeah.

65
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:21,158
Let me tell you a story
about a little Jewish fellow

66
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,535
named Steven...

67
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:25,913
Spielberg.

68
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,706
- Here we go. Love this one.
- Anyway...

69
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:28,624
Yeah. Love him.

70
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,251
When Steven Spielberg shows up
to his film sets, he has no plan.

71
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:33,670
He has no shot list.
He hasn't gone over it with the actors.

72
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:37,090
He just likes to get there,
see what unfolds.

73
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:40,010
That's what we're like.
We're like Spielberg.

74
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,720
- No plan.
- No plan.

75
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,180
He's actually a congregant here.

76
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,806
- He's building a new wing.
- Really?

77
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:46,975
Building a whole new thing.
The Spielberg Wing.

78
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:49,394
- Gonna be right there. It's pretty cool.
- My gosh.

79
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,897
You don't have to wear the <i>kippah</i>
if you don't want to.

80
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:55,150
We "keep-a-it" very casual
when it comes to <i>kippahs</i> here.

81
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,945
- Lose that bad boy.
- Okay.

82
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,446
- Yeah. Might as well...
- Dude. Look at me.

83
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,323
- Raw.
- Yeah, no, I noticed.

84
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,242
- I'm fancy-free over here.
- Yeah.

85
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,660
I'm rawdoggin' the world.

86
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,161
- Okay.
- Look at that.

87
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:09,248
- So much lighter in the face.
- You grew two inches, it looks like.

88
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,415
Feels good, huh?

89
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,417
I don't know.

90
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,795
- You seem happier.
- Yeah.

91
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,922
I'll try it. I'll try it tomorrow.
Maybe tomorrow.

92
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:20,175
You're gonna have crazy dreams tonight.
Since that's been off. Yeah.

93
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:22,136
- Hope you have a journal.
- Clips.

94
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:23,638
Clips are a pain.

95
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,476
Oh my gosh.

96
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:33,438
You know, Temple Ahava is one of
my top contenders for conversion classes.

97
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,359
I woke up this morning
feeling extra Jewish.

98
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,610
How nice for you.

99
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,280
- Thank you.
- Okay.

100
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:42,824
What do we think?

101
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:46,286
Um...

102
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:51,499
Okay, a long pause.
Usually that's not good.

103
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,420
Mm. I don't know. It has a pajama feel.

104
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,129
- Oh.
- It's nice.

105
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,089
Okay.

106
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:02,050
Did you guys see the panty lines?
They were really, really obvious.

107
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:05,137
I'm 100% fine saying something to Morgan.

108
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:08,432
I just think it would be better
coming from the two of you, you know?

109
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:09,851
About the dress?

110
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,686
No. About how crazy this is.

111
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:16,356
Dr. Andy is not a real person.
I feel like Morgan's gonna end up

112
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:18,942
the subject of some murder podcast
everyone's obsessed with.

113
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:21,987
Oh, please. You're being very dramatic.

114
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:25,282
I don't think you're being
dramatic enough. I don't get it, Mom.

115
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:28,535
You'll call me for an hour to talk about
your friend's daughter's house

116
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,912
that fell out of escrow,
but this? Nothing?

117
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:31,872
Yeah, I don't know.

118
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,959
Sometimes, for me, small things feel big,
and big things feel small.

119
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:38,587
Okay, but, Dad, you can see
that this is crazy, right?

120
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,964
The whole world's crazy.

121
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:43,008
You know what? I'm done judging people.

122
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,009
Well, I'm not.

123
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,638
And quite frankly, I'm judging
the two of you for not judging this.

124
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:54,895
Yeah, the article's really interesting.

125
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:57,814
It was talking about
how to modernize the temple experience

126
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,649
while maintaining traditions.

127
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,486
- Totally. I read that exact same article.
- Did you?

128
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:06,281
Really enjoyed it. I read it twice
and couldn't agree more with it, honestly.

129
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:08,992
- You gotta make sure there's substance.
- Bingo.

130
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,786
You're forgetting I sent you that article.

131
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:11,787
I sent you the article.

132
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:15,290
It was important to me. A friend
from college wrote it. Proud of her.

133
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,541
It was a great article.

134
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:19,211
But you wanna challenge people
spiritually, of course,

135
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,504
but you wanna keep it fun.

136
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:21,797
- It has to be fun.
- Right. Yeah.

137
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:22,756
- Very fun.
- I mean...

138
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,383
I think a challenge is fun.

139
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,802
We believe fun
should be fun here at Ahava.

140
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,637
- I ag...
- We think it's hard out there.

141
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,848
It's fun in here. You know what I mean?

142
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,601
- Love that.
- That's what God would want.

143
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:38,021
I'm sorry we, uh, didn't tell you
that we bring our own lunches here.

144
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:40,148
I know.
I was actually thinking we should have

145
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:42,025
a document with all that information.

146
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:44,069
I'm gonna share a note. Open it this time.

147
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,780
You always forget.
He'll never open them. I don't know why.

148
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:51,493
That is fine. Uh, you know, tomorrow,
I will know to bring my own lunch.

149
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,912
God, I'm supposed
to teach the after-school program.

150
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,288
What if you jumped in there?

151
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,874
The kids are great.
We'd love for you to get to know them.

152
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,252
- I love the spontaneity and all that.
- Yeah, right?

153
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:03,089
I'm... I'm not...
I don't feel like I'm prepared.

154
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,801
But okay. All right.
Yeah, sure. I'll give it a go.

155
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:08,927
- Um...
- Okay.

156
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:12,764
I could go whip something up real quick.
Maybe tie it to last week's Torah portion.

157
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,809
- Bold. I like it.
- Ooh.

158
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,394
Come on. Do it.

159
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,312
Great.

160
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,022
Uh, it...

161
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,650
It has a horsey feeling.

162
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,193
- What?
- Yeah.

163
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:26,486
I see the horsey thing.

164
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:30,407
I'm sorry. Wait. Like, do you guys mean,
like, equestrian or...

165
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,659
- I don't...
- Don't ask me. She went rogue.

166
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,744
I mean, like...

167
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,956
- What?
- What?

168
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,666
What? I thought it was fun.

169
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:40,667
Here we go.

170
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:44,254
Are you fucking kidding me?
Like fun in a hostile way. God.

171
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:47,091
- I thought it was funny.
- Well, it wasn't.

172
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,805
I wanna say something to her,
but I... I can't figure out how.

173
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:56,141
This is like a complicated surgery,
you know?

174
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,685
And if I make one wrong move,
then one of us dies.

175
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,729
This makes me think about my wedding day.

176
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:04,149
I was so sure what I was doing
was the exact right thing for me.

177
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,484
How little I knew.

178
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,112
- All roads lead back to you, huh?
- Hm?

179
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,573
But you're right, Mom.
I mean, someone should be sure

180
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,910
they're making the right decision
on their wedding day.

181
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,496
There's no reason to rush into anything.

182
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,919
This portion of the Torah
is focusing on the two weeks

183
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,837
before the Exodus out of Egypt.

184
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,048
Winter's over. Springtime has begun.

185
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,759
Nisan is the month of renewal.
It's a time of new beginnings.

186
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,220
I wanna talk about
a new beginning I had last week.

187
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,722
I just got out of a relationship,
and I feel like...

188
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,098
Hey, I hate to interrupt you.

189
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,141
- What?
- Um...

190
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,185
I wanna hear all about
the new relationship.

191
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,853
It's just that I wasn't quite finished.

192
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,773
Oh, wow. Sorry. Uh...

193
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:46,359
Usually we just do the talking here.

194
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,569
- Really?
- Yeah.

195
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,696
- So it's a class, but I don't teach?
- Pretty much.

196
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,407
You could teach a little at the end.

197
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,493
Okay. Yeah, why don't you guys talk,

198
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,788
and if there's time, I'll talk at the end.

199
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:02,249
Well, um, she's this great girl,

200
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,586
but she... she just didn't think
I... I had enough rizz to grow a mustache.

201
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:10,591
But I... I really want a mustache.
She just... She really wouldn't let me.

202
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,636
- That's so beautiful!
- Morgan, that's the one.

203
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:17,764
Is it perfect? I... I can't decide.

204
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,474
No, no, it's perfect.

205
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:22,103
God, it's really true.
You know, when you know, you know.

206
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:26,439
Maybe. But sometimes
don't you think you know,

207
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,734
then you wake up one morning
and realize, "Wow, I really didn't know"?

208
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,572
Oh my God.
Joanne, will you just say it, okay?

209
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,072
What?

210
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,616
You don't think I should be marrying Andy.
Just say it.

211
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,619
Uh, that's not true.

212
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,830
- And it's Dr. Andy.
- Oh my God. See? There it is.

213
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:45,250
What? That was a joke. But you do
call him that, and it's kind of odd.

214
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,336
From the very beginning, you have
never said anything nice about him.

215
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:50,046
Yes, I did.
Mm-mm.

216
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:52,257
Didn't I tell you
that I thought he was polite?

217
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,175
No. No, actually, you didn't.

218
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:56,761
- I can't drink enough.
- Okay, I think he's very polite.

219
00:09:56,762 --> 00:10:00,557
That's what you say about people you don't
like. Stop being such a fucking liar.

220
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:01,808
- You know what?
- What?

221
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,894
Okay, wedding dress shopping
can be very emotional.

222
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,563
Let's just chill out, all right?

223
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,607
Too bad we didn't
get a family picture before this.

224
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,192
At the end of the night,
after we got engaged, you came up to me.

225
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:12,695
Do you remember what you said?

226
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:14,946
Yeah, I said congratulations.

227
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,532
- No.
- I definitely said congratulations.

228
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:21,161
No, actually, what you said was,
"Congratulations?"

229
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,370
I did not say it like that.

230
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:23,538
- You did.
- I didn't.

231
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:27,793
So you're telling me
that you are 100% happy for me?

232
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,089
- Morgan, who's 100% happy for anything?
- Okay.

233
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,717
I'm being serious.
But since you brought it up, you know,

234
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,345
it is a little bit strange
how quick it's all going.

235
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:41,681
Like, what is the rush?
You don't know anything about this person.

236
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:43,475
Yes, I have known him for years.

237
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,352
No, he knows you.

238
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,980
You spent those years
not knowing anything about him.

239
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,524
Joanne, look at you, okay?

240
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:55,153
You're in a wedding dress.
It is so clear that you are jealous of me.

241
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:58,406
It couldn't be more clear. It's like
you are screaming, "I am jealous!"

242
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,283
Okay, no, this was a joke, Morgan.

243
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:02,786
You can't come to a wedding dress shop
and not try one on.

244
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,789
You can if you're not an attention whore.

245
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:06,707
He's right, Joanne.

246
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:10,461
You can.

247
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,552
You can't move as quickly
in your relationship,

248
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:20,637
and it's killing you.

249
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,180
Not true. I'm worried about you.

250
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,391
I'm worried it's what Dr. Andy wants,
not what you want.

251
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,350
It is what I want!

252
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,811
No, have you ever pushed back on him?
Have you?

253
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:30,063
You're a challenger.
I've never seen you challenge him.

254
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:33,358
Maybe that's who I was and not who I am.
Just admit you're jealous.

255
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:36,820
You're late, but I love how on fire
you guys are. Gonna be a great episode.

256
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,530
I don't wanna
do the stupid podcast anyway.

257
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,490
I was literally about to say that first.

258
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,535
Oh, Lord, give me strength.

259
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,959
Lock in, ladies.
Read your notes or something.

260
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:53,587
Okay.

261
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,798
I don't know, what does this mean?
It just says "Fabrizio."

262
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,466
Oh, Fabrizio, my landlord.

263
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,927
Um, he's been super annoying lately,

264
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:05,473
and so I thought we could talk about him
because landlord issues are so relatable.

265
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:07,809
I mean, I love Fabrizio. He hates you.

266
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,727
I know.

267
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,563
Remember when I threw up in the pool,
and he had to drain it,

268
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,399
and it cost, like, $3,000,
and he never knew it was me?

269
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,153
And he asked if I knew who it was again
the other day, and I was like,

270
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,572
"I don't know, but that's disgusting,

271
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,700
and whoever it was
really needs to pay for it."

272
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,537
Yup. You're a terrible tenant. Um...

273
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,416
These notes honestly

274
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,168
are boring.

275
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:33,501
- So...
- Okay.

276
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,755
Well, Morgan, what would you like
to talk about, then?

277
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,924
- We could talk about my wedding.
- Oh.

278
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,343
Yup. I mean,
I still need to pick a maid of honor.

279
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:45,889
Picking a maid of honor is one of
the most important decisions in life.

280
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:46,931
It's really not.

281
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,350
Okay, well, whatever.

282
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,478
You don't support my decisions,
you're not gonna be my maid of honor.

283
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,937
Are you joking?

284
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:53,981
No.

285
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:58,485
We should be able to hate each other
and still be each other's maids of honor.

286
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:01,696
- Sorry, I'm asking Ashley.
- I'm gonna be a fucking maid of honor?

287
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:02,781
- Ashley?
- Yeah.

288
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,074
Well, Ashley's a work friend,
not a real friend.

289
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:07,327
Ashley's a work friend
who has become a real friend,

290
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,745
and a better friend than you.

291
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,206
Well, if Ashley becomes
your maid of honor,

292
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,458
then she's going back
to being a work friend for me.

293
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,753
- One that I don't trust and don't like.
- Excuse me?

294
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:19,714
Fine. Whatever.
Make Ashley your maid of honor.

295
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:21,007
- I will.
- I don't want the job.

296
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:24,385
Only responsibility is splitting the bill
at the bachelorette party. No, thank you.

297
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:25,386
No, thank you!

298
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:27,096
Can we talk about something else?

299
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:30,266
Well, I mean, we can't say
anything interesting about Noah

300
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:32,894
because you're not allowed,
so that's off the table.

301
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:35,063
Guys are obsessed with privacy.

302
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,232
Everybody knows that. It's totally normal.

303
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,025
I can say whatever I want about Andy.

304
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:41,569
Andy hates his mother
and was in a hit-and-run once.

305
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:46,450
Everybody knows Dr. Andy doesn't care
about things like boundaries or privacy.

306
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,371
I guess we don't have anything
to talk about.

307
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:52,498
I guess we don't.

308
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:00,047
Okay, eyes up here.
I'll wait for everyone.

309
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:04,008
Welcome to the four corners game.
Things are about to get very real.

310
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:07,762
Very real. As you can see,
we're surrounded by four signs.

311
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:11,891
Strongly agree, agree,
strongly disagree, and disagree.

312
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,268
I'm gonna say a statement.

313
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:16,396
You guys go to the sign
that best describes your opinions.

314
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,730
What's the point of this?

315
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:20,567
Well, Menachem, the point is that
we are going to explore

316
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,278
our relationship to Judaism
in our day-to-day lives

317
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,905
and just explore
how we live our lives in general.

318
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,323
First statement.

319
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:31,286
It is okay to skip <i>Shabbat</i>
if it's the opening night of a movie

320
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,706
starring your favorite
Fantastic Four character.

321
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,208
The Thing is Jewish,
by the way, for the record.

322
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,376
Mm.

323
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,003
Julia Garner as Silver Surfer.

324
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,172
- She's amazing.
- She's amazing.

325
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:47,677
- You don't like the Fantastic Four?
- No, I'm neutral on the Fantastic Four.

326
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,679
You seem more negative than neutral.

327
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,972
I'm neutral.

328
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:53,725
Opening weekends
are very important to the congregants.

329
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,644
We've got a lot of industry people.

330
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,062
<i>Shabbat.</i>

331
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,357
We each worship differently.

332
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:01,941
Next question.

333
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:05,278
It is never okay to regift
a <i>bar</i> or <i>bat mitzvah</i> gift from your <i>bubbe.</i>

334
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,405
- Even if it sucks!
- Oh.

335
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:11,075
<i>Well, my old man
Finally saw my face on the telly</i>

336
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:14,371
<i>Made a little joke
About the size of his belly...</i>

337
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:16,331
It's your <i>bubbe.</i>

338
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,707
She won't know.

339
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:21,127
<i>Didn't bother asking
What she's fussing about</i>

340
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:24,172
<i>Oh, how they stay together
I don't think I'll ever get it...</i>

341
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,049
No Mel Gibson movies.

342
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,384
<i>But only if I let it</i>

343
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:31,931
<i>I wanna fall in love
And not scare 'em away...</i>

344
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:37,227
Okay, I got a really fun one here.
Kylie is the best Kardashian.

345
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:38,771
Uh-oh.

346
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:40,814
Stampede.

347
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,650
Don't wanna get in trouble.

348
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:47,279
Timotheé is Jewish, for the record.
That's right.

349
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:51,616
There you go, Noah.
With the herd on this one, huh?

350
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,036
- Oh yeah.
- What do you like most about her?

351
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,417
I like her dancing.

352
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,627
Doesn't really dance that much.

353
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:06,048
Not known for dancing,
but I bet she's good.

354
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:10,802
Well, that was a spicy one

355
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,388
before we got to
the 20 minutes of silence.

356
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,847
What time works next Thursday?

357
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:18,351
- I think maybe we should take a break.
- Yeah, I think we need to pause the pod.

358
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,980
No, I mean we should
take a break from each other.

359
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,732
Shouldn't I be consulted in this?

360
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:25,776
- No.
- No.

361
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:27,861
Thoughts and prayers.

362
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:32,448
Listen, I don't feel comfortable with you

363
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,659
if you are not comfortable
with me and Dr. Andy.

364
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,912
Yeah, actually, that makes sense.

365
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:42,041
I might not always be clear
about what I want versus what he wants,

366
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:45,586
but, Joanne, honestly,
neither are you, okay?

367
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:48,215
Don't you wanna
talk about Noah more on the podcast?

368
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,925
- Maybe, but...
- And you can't tell him that.

369
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:55,013
And what you really can't tell him is that
you wish conversion wasn't such an issue

370
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:58,057
because that would make
your life a lot easier. Like mine is.

371
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:00,351
Okay, Morgan,
but there is a very real reason

372
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,854
why I am saying
you are going too quick with Dr. Andy.

373
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,732
Okay. What?

374
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:09,736
Because I never said anything
the first time you jumped into a marriage,

375
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,155
and I really regret that.

376
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,451
I'm sorry I had to say that.

377
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:17,411
Yeah.

378
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,788
Well, now you said it.

379
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:22,373
And thank you. Yeah.

380
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,918
But, um, this time is different, so...

381
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:34,511
<i>Yes!</i>

382
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:39,182
They pack their lunch every day,
and nobody told me to pack my own lunch.

383
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,517
Wait, nobody told you to pack a lunch?

384
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,186
God, that's borderline abusive.

385
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,689
I know. I know. I almost fainted.

386
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:50,319
Man, it's not just that
Neil and Cami are annoying.

387
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,196
I like this temple on paper. I do.

388
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:56,949
Noah, I'm already pretty attached
to you working at Temple Ahava.

389
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,910
Like, changed your email on my phone.

390
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,828
Is there any way you can make this work?

391
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,206
I don't know.

392
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:05,334
I got a bad feeling,
like I made a mistake.

393
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:08,127
<i>Okay, well, bro, it's only your first day.</i>

394
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,171
Yeah.

395
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,840
When you know, you know.

396
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:16,427
I just wish I didn't feel like
if this place isn't the right fit for us,

397
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,930
then no place is.

398
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:20,973
Oh, she's back. Okay, I gotta go.

399
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:24,103
Hey, I'm going through some stuff too,
so hit me back soon. Hello?

400
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,106
- Hey!
- Hey!

401
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,316
How was your day?

402
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,610
It was good.

403
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,695
How was yours?

404
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:35,280
Good.

405
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:48,752
<i>Don't ever say that
I ain't a gentleman</i>

406
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:54,675
<i>Went down on my knees and
And do it no one can</i>

407
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:59,220
<i>I gave you good loving
And I took it right back</i>

408
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:02,682
<i>Mama said run
Before your soul gets snatched</i>

409
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:07,688
<i>That thing ain't worth it
I'd rather use my hands</i>

410
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:12,692
<i>If you think I sit up late at night</i>

411
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:15,695
<i>Wiping teardrops from my eyes</i>

412
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:19,283
<i>Must be out your goddamn mind</i>

413
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:21,701
<i>Out your goddamn mind</i>

414
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:24,705
<i>If you think I won't find love again</i>

415
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:28,207
<i>Darling, I got other friends</i>

416
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:32,211
<i>If you don't know I was the man</i>

417
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:35,465
<i>You've got another thing coming</i>

418
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:42,222
<i>You've got another thing coming</i>
