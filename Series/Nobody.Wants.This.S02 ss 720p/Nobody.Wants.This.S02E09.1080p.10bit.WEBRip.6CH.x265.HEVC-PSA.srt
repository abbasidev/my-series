1
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:07,549
<i>Hot</i>

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,884
<i>Hot, hot</i>

3
00:00:10,593 --> 00:00:14,638
<i>I've tried being patient with my agent
But then I had a change of heart</i>

4
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,391
<i>If I get a text from another ex
I swear I'm gonna...</i>

5
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:20,103
Look at that.
Bed folds right into the wall.

6
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:22,813
So bleak.

7
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:26,568
We don't know anyone with a great place
who's about to die, do we?

8
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,529
I just can't believe
that Fabrizio was so sensitive.

9
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,490
I've said way worse things
about people who did not evict me.

10
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:36,119
What about that one?
That one looks nice, actually.

11
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:39,621
You want me to live in the Valley?
That is what you want for me?

12
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:41,999
Don't get discouraged.
You're gonna find something.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,501
You might love it more
than your place now. You never know.

14
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:47,171
This one's cute. I love Spanish style.

15
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,757
Oh, it has a breakfast nook

16
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:52,176
and a bay window.

17
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:53,595
I might learn to knit.

18
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:55,637
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

19
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:57,348
What are you gonna do with three bedrooms?

20
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,895
I don't know. I was just thinking ahead.

21
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:06,356
Yeah. I mean, obviously,
you know, in a perfect world,

22
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:07,942
we'd just move in together, but

23
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:09,944
it's all about timing.

24
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:14,866
You're gonna find a place you love so much
you're never gonna wanna leave.

25
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:19,245
Yeah, that's fine.

26
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,081
Perfect.

27
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,712
She obviously wants to move in together,
but I let her know,

28
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:32,050
without hurting her feelings, I don't
think it's such a good idea right now.

29
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:36,512
She seemed to understand. You know?
She, uh, said it was fine.

30
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,222
She said it was fine?

31
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:39,556
God, you're adorable.

32
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:41,768
Truly, what a pure soul.

33
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,104
- What? I don't get it.
- Yep.

34
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,564
When Esther says that she's fine,

35
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:50,484
I understand that to mean
that she is not fine,

36
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,903
and it is my job
to figure out what's wrong.

37
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:56,574
And that applies
to every other woman without exception.

38
00:01:57,158 --> 00:02:00,244
Honestly, Esther's been saying
that she's fine a lot lately,

39
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,620
and it's terrifying.

40
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:02,789
Maybe she is fine.

41
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:10,045
Last night, she pretended to take a call
while I was trying to connect with her.

42
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:13,049
The home screen was lit up.
I didn't have the heart to tell her.

43
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,218
- I don't love that.
- Nope.

44
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:17,803
Well, I wouldn't worry.
You guys are solid.

45
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,764
And I know Joanne and I are, too, but...

46
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:21,558
Gotta tell ya,

47
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:24,476
I really thought she'd be Jewish by now.

48
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,980
I can't rush it.
I don't wanna put pressure on her.

49
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:28,897
You know, I always think,

50
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:31,692
if I could choose to be Jewish,
would I choose to be Jewish?

51
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:32,610
Yeah?

52
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:36,363
I mean, yeah, I love being Jewish,
but is it the best religion?

53
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:38,490
I don't know. Never got to shop around.

54
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,285
Oh! Oh! Fake. Oh!

55
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:43,453
- Oh boy! Your boy went up high.
- Oh!

56
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:45,623
Don't even try it.

57
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:49,586
Peace offering?

58
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,089
It's from Courage.
Have any idea how long that line is?

59
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:55,007
Fine.

60
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,967
Oh, wow. You have a ring and everything.

61
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:59,052
It was his grandma's,
so I couldn't give notes.

62
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:00,805
But it's fine. Come on.

63
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,727
- Close the door behind you.
- I know how to close a door, Morgan.

64
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,605
Actually, I'd honestly prefer
if you stand for this

65
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,399
'cause I want it to feel formal.

66
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,026
Of course.

67
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:14,610
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,988
Okay, so for what exactly?
I'm just curious.

69
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,615
For being a monster
at your dress shopping.

70
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:20,991
Wedding dress shopping.

71
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,910
Right. Wedding dress shopping.

72
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,369
- Yeah.
- But...

73
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:28,248
Andy says that you can't start an apology
with "but," or it's not an apology at all.

74
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:30,959
I didn't start the apology with the "but."
It was at the end.

75
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,879
- Whatever. You know what I mean.
- Yes, fine. You're right.

76
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,797
I'm sorry, period.

77
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:38,885
You needed a friend, and I wasn't there,
and I'm gonna do better.

78
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:44,431
So why now? I mean,
you've had, like, days to apologize.

79
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:47,435
I just came to the realization
that I need my sister.

80
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,687
- Okay, so there's a Noah problem.
- No.

81
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:51,688
- Yes. Come on.
- No.

82
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:54,567
- That's not... That's actually not it.
- Okay, what is it?

83
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,238
I was evicted.

84
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:01,198
- Fabrizio, like, heard all of that stuff...
- Oh, shit.

85
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,991
I admitted to on the podcast.

86
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:05,077
- Mm.
- I'm just flattered he's a listener.

87
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,536
Fuck. Okay, listen.

88
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:09,122
I'm sorry. I told Fabrizio
that we gave him a shout-out.

89
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:10,499
- What?
- I know.

90
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,708
- Morgan!
- I'm sorry.

91
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,919
- This is your fault.
- It's just the truth. I'm sorry.

92
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,588
Okay, guess what? We are even.

93
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,715
Whoo! Okay, all the anxiety
just left my body.

94
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:20,759
- Fine. We're even.
- Yeah. Great.

95
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,096
- Even Stephens. You're forgiven.
- Good. So are you.

96
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:26,682
Hold on.
Why don't you just move in with Noah?

97
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:30,143
- That's a great question.
- Oh, there's the Noah problem.

98
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:31,478
Yep.

99
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:34,356
I feel ready,
but apparently, I'm alone in that.

100
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:37,025
But moving in with someone
before you think things through

101
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:40,404
can lead to seeing a couples therapist
named Lois. So things could be worse.

102
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,489
What? You guys are in therapy?

103
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,283
If I'm gonna open up to you about this,

104
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,494
I need you to swear to me
that you're not gonna hold it against me.

105
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,621
You can't say "I told you so,"
or anything.

106
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,457
- All right?
- I get it.

107
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,293
And I swear. Okay?

108
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,336
Okay.

109
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:59,798
- So we ran into his ex-girlfriend.
- Mm.

110
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:00,716
Helena.

111
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,175
And she was prettier than you?

112
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:04,053
- No. Not at all.
- Oh.

113
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:08,890
If I'm being really honest in the spirit
of honesty and an honest conversation,

114
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,350
yes, she's much prettier than me.

115
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:11,894
Anyway, she

116
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,022
is also his ex-patient.

117
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,860
- Hm.
- Hm.

118
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:21,446
Mm.

119
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:22,905
Hm.

120
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,073
Hm.

121
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:27,951
You're having a brain aneurysm
trying not to judge this, aren't you?

122
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:29,620
Mm-mm.

123
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:33,415
I support you going to therapy

124
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,460
and addressing your concerns.

125
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,087
Thank you.

126
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:42,341
Don't hold it against him either.
I'm gonna handle this.

127
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,467
- Uh, great.
- I am.

128
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,552
I know you will.
I won't hold it against him.

129
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:46,803
I was gonna invite you guys

130
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:49,389
to this happy hour beer garden thing
we're all going to.

131
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:53,644
Me, Noah, Sasha, and Esther.
I do wanna get to know Dr. Andy better.

132
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:57,564
Well, that's a start.
Honestly, it sounds kind of fun.

133
00:05:57,565 --> 00:06:00,942
I can drop little hints
about how fun it is to live with someone.

134
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,402
You know? Really subtly.

135
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:05,155
- Don't even bother. I think you're right.
- Hm.

136
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:07,908
We shouldn't rush it,
and I'd rather move in with him

137
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,869
when he feels excited about it,
not because I'm homeless.

138
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,787
Mm.

139
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,790
Andy says the word is "unhoused."

140
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:19,628
So when I heard about Helena,
I didn't have an issue with it because...

141
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,255
Helena! Oh my God.

142
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:24,467
We barely got out of
that one alive, right?

143
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:27,637
Oh my...

144
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,265
Sorry. Go on.

145
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,935
All right. Anyway, um,

146
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:38,647
when I met her and, you know, found out
that patient dating is, like, his thing,

147
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,775
I was, like, obviously very upset,
you know?

148
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:45,112
Oh my God. Of course. Of course.
I mean, it does not look good.

149
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,196
Thank you.

150
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:49,492
Yeah, but life is unexpected. You know?

151
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:53,370
It served him at the time. We had to
go through that in order to get to here.

152
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,122
Oh yeah!

153
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,583
We sure did. Wow.

154
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:01,586
Okay. Um, anyway, it also made me realize

155
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,756
that, like, I just don't know
anything about him.

156
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,134
Now, to be fair, Morgan...

157
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,094
Yes?

158
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:12,639
You have not asked me a single question
about me in two years.

159
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,850
What? Are you fucking...
You were my therapist.

160
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,894
I was paying you to listen.
I'm not supposed to ask you questions.

161
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,604
This is what I was talking about.

162
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,314
It's exactly what you said.

163
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:22,441
This is what I was saying.

164
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,317
It's worse than I thought.

165
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:27,113
Morgan, I think you should
get to know each other.

166
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,825
Andy may turn out to be
the love of your life, right?

167
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,912
You don't want to mess all that up
for some woman named Helena.

168
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,539
Morgan, just give me another chance.

169
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,583
Please.

170
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,585
Get to know me.

171
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,423
Oh, fuck.

172
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,675
That's moving.

173
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,221
Okay, this one or this one?

174
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:55,599
This one's got, like,
a Benny Blanco thing going on.

175
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,727
This one's more like cool Japanese guy.

176
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:03,690
I don't know. God, they're both so good.

177
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:06,818
- Oh, I don't know, Sash. I don't care.
- What are you talking about?

178
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,278
You love picking my clothes.

179
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,363
Not today. Just do you.

180
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:11,365
Okay.

181
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,618
What's going on?
And do not tell me that you're fine.

182
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:15,620
Sash.

183
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,997
I'm just tired
of picking your outfits every single day

184
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,124
and telling you
our bank account information

185
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,835
and showing you
how to literally use the dishwasher.

186
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,338
Like, I'm not your mother.

187
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,256
Okay.

188
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:28,925
Wow.

189
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,428
Just do, um...
Sash, just do the Japanese guy.

190
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,681
- That's what I was gonna do.
- Okay.

191
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,851
I like the... I like the Japanese guy.

192
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:51,863
- There he is.
- Oh, hey!

193
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,991
Ey! Joanne, find a place to live yet?

194
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:57,285
Not yet, but it's all good.
I'm sure something will come up soon.

195
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,622
- Okay.
- I'll help sort through listings tomorrow.

196
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,083
- Great.
- Have you ever considered Orange County?

197
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:07,046
- Feels like there's cute places there.
- How dare you! Pooh, pooh, pooh.

198
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,839
- Did you pooh, pooh, pooh?
- She pooh, pooh, poohed.

199
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,676
Yeah, isn't that what you say
to ward off the evil spirits?

200
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:13,885
- No, you did good.
- Yeah.

201
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:17,347
Orange County, no. I refuse to be
one of those people who enjoys the beach.

202
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,140
I just can't imagine that for myself.

203
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:21,518
- I can't imagine living by myself.
- Oh, I can.

204
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,605
Put something down, and then later, when
you're looking for it, it's still there.

205
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:26,607
Sounds amazing.

206
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,401
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Hi, everyone.

207
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,655
You're welcome. This hang
will no longer be boring because

208
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:33,989
we brought a game.

209
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,075
- Oh. Ah!
- Oh, hell yeah.

210
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,955
<i>Believe it when...</i>

211
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:45,458
"Answer these questions
for deep conversation," okay?

212
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:49,337
"To address conflict,
uncover secrets, or spark play."

213
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:52,090
- Ooh!
- High stakes, high rewards, guys.

214
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,342
Wait, your couples therapist
gave you a game?

215
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:57,971
Um, she invented it,
sold the movie rights.

216
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,347
I'm an associate producer now.

217
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,057
- Really? Wow.
- Isn't that crazy?

218
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,684
This is very fun. We're doing it.

219
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,604
I'm sick of having the same
boring conversations with you guys.

220
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,480
- Oh, there she is. I missed you.
- Yes.

221
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,441
Stop getting along. It's off-putting.

222
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,985
- Joanne, I am picking you a card first.
- Great.

223
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,696
- Wait, don't look at it.
- I'm allowed.

224
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:18,533
"A time I pretended I wasn't crying was..."

225
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,702
- Mm.
- Oh, wow. These are intense.

226
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:21,787
Um...

227
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,999
Oh, probably that car commercial

228
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,251
where the dad drives away
and drops the kid at college.

229
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:30,003
No. No. Joanne.

230
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,464
No jokes. You have to be real.

231
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,674
The one where the dad's
looking in the rearview mirror.

232
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,676
He sees his son fading into the distance.

233
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,094
- Sure. Yeah.
- That's sad.

234
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:40,014
Joanne, something real.

235
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,226
Okay. Um...

236
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,229
Oh, I know what it is. Um...

237
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,482
When Mom and Dad told us
they were getting a divorce.

238
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,025
- Oh. Yeah.
- Do you remember?

239
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,277
I mean, I was an adult,
and I was happy for them.

240
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:57,530
I was just really sad
that it took that long,

241
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,074
and I was embarrassed,

242
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,993
so I hid from Morgan in the bathroom
while I cried.

243
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,871
Mm, you did?

244
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,582
I didn't know that.

245
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,583
I hate it when you cry.

246
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:11,711
Aw. I never get to see you guys
be sweet to each other.

247
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,463
I mean, to be fair,

248
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:16,299
I hate it when she cries
because she's a really ugly crier, so...

249
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,343
She really is.

250
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,844
See? You guys.

251
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:24,015
- She's back.
- The game is working!

252
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,768
"Weirdest thing I do alone."

253
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:27,436
Uh...

254
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:31,606
I mean, I vote for every
<i>American Idol</i> contestant that I love

255
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,149
on all of my devices.

256
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,818
I've been 90% right.

257
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,069
Can't unhear that.

258
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,029
- Who's next?
- Uh, Esther.

259
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,366
Oh. I stole a thong
from Victoria's Secret.

260
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,243
When I got arrested in Thailand.

261
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,245
- That was so scary.
- It was wild.

262
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,913
Oh, young Maggie Smith. 100%.

263
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,124
This is easy.
When someone says, "I read that,"

264
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,792
but they listened to the audiobook.

265
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,795
I know that I do that,
but at least I know it's annoying.

266
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,214
- Do you?
- Yes!

267
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,217
The boat is docked on shore.
I jump off, I hit the sand,

268
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:03,388
but the backpack is so heavy that
I just actually fall backwards anyway.

269
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,141
It gets wet. From the beginning,
I could've just jumped in.

270
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:09,352
- It's like a cartoon.
- Exactly. I'm, like, going in.

271
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:10,937
That's amazing.

272
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:12,856
Uh, Esther, I think it's your turn.

273
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,650
- I think it's your turn.
- Oh, goodness gracious.

274
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:19,028
- Okay. "My deepest fantasy is..."
- Ooh.

275
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:19,946
Hm.

276
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:22,490
Okay. Uh, my deepest fantasy...

277
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:27,370
Oh, I know. It's to be Diane Keaton
in <i>Baby Boom.</i> Pre-baby.

278
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:31,666
Oh, she's just like a tiger lady
living on the tenth floor,

279
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:34,002
eating steak every night at 11:00 p.m.

280
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,879
No kids. No husband.

281
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,299
Right? She can do whatever she wants
whenever she wants.

282
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,427
- Oh my fucking God.
- Okay. That seems like a new one.

283
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,846
You don't let us eat past 7:00 p.m.
When are...

284
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,348
Okay, that's why it's a fantasy.
It's not real.

285
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,642
It kinda sounds like
you want it to be real.

286
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:52,020
- I think you're up next.
- Yeah, I think it's me.

287
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,148
It's my turn. My turn, my turn. Excuse me.

288
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,233
"What was a difficult decision
you made recently?"

289
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,068
Oh, this one's very obvious.

290
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:02,197
Yeah, sure.
Um, my decision to leave Temple Chai.

291
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,450
It was a tough one, but I stand by it.

292
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:08,453
- Boom.
- But that was a while ago, wasn't it?

293
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,662
- I think the card...
- No.

294
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:11,831
That was a tough decision
to leave Temple Chai,

295
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,374
but the card says recently.

296
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,835
- I can't think of anything else.
- Really?

297
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:19,089
Nothing from like, I don't know,
this morning or...

298
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,383
Deciding if you wanna live together, or...

299
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,427
I don't think this is the place
to talk about that.

300
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,638
Everyone else is answering
really honestly.

301
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,681
- Sometimes too honestly.
- It's a game.

302
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,266
- I'll answer another card.
- No.

303
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:33,561
No, no. You can't do that.
I don't even think that's legal, bro.

304
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:36,356
Why would you not just
answer the question honestly?

305
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:39,109
Because it wasn't
a difficult decision, Joanne.

306
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,196
It wasn't?

307
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,699
I am sorry. I will explain later, okay?

308
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,827
No, that's fine.

309
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:52,748
No, it is legal.

310
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,836
Yeah, you can do that. Okay, it's my turn.

311
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,671
"What is something
you need to let go of or release?"

312
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,048
Oh, this one is actually pretty easy.

313
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:06,053
It is the anger
that I have towards my twin brother.

314
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,347
I'm sorry, you have a twin?

315
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,557
Yeah, Branigan.

316
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:13,935
Sorry, Morgan, you did not know
that this man here has a twin brother?

317
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,563
No. Nope. He didn't tell me. No.

318
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:17,814
Well, you didn't ask.

319
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,859
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have to ask
if you have a twin, right?

320
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,610
- Why would I ask?
- I'm sorry.

321
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:25,405
That's the kind of thing
that just comes up in conversation.

322
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,740
Well, now you know.

323
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:30,201
Because of this beautiful game, right?

324
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,494
- Who's next?
- Nobody.

325
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:34,038
- Don't think anyone wants to play anymore.
- What do you mean?

326
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,875
Everybody else got three turns.
I'm gonna take my third turn.

327
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:37,792
Great.

328
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:40,880
All right. "What's your newest passion?"

329
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:42,338
It's kind of easy.

330
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:44,048
Um, obviously, it's not new,

331
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,302
but I've been really enjoying
my jiu-jitsu classes lately.

332
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:48,261
Mm.

333
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,178
Sorry, what?

334
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,430
Uh, jiu-jitsu.

335
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,181
- Jiu-jitsu?
- I thought you quit.

336
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:54,267
Uh, no, I didn't quit.
I just stopped telling you

337
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:57,228
because you weren't interested,
but I'm actually a purple belt.

338
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:00,690
- It's kind of a big deal in some circles.
- In which circles?

339
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,859
I've never heard you mention this.

340
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,612
Are you joking? I...

341
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:08,031
- I invite you guys to all my tournaments.
- I thought that was spam.

342
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,450
Okay, and now we know you have tournaments

343
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,285
that we're gonna go to.

344
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:16,456
Okay, yeah. I started doing jiu-jitsu
because I was so depressed at work,

345
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:19,292
and I was looking for somewhere
to put all the aggression I had.

346
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,586
Esther, I hired a job counselor.

347
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,254
Okay, sorry. It's okay.

348
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,797
- It's not okay.
- Babe, it's okay.

349
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:27,717
- You're shouting at a bar.
- Nobody fucking listens to me.

350
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,552
I gotta field everybody else's problems.

351
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:32,430
Noah's like, "Joanne wants to move in,
but I don't want her to."

352
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,057
- Sasha!
- "Now she's upset."

353
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,893
- You said that?
- He's doing a bad job paraphrasing.

354
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,519
And you make us play this game

355
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,398
because you literally don't know anything
about the man that you are going to marry.

356
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,108
- Oh my God.
- It scares you.

357
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,610
Are you fucking serious right now?

358
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,613
You're probably fine because I guess
you can marry the love of your life,

359
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,448
and she still hates your fucking guts.

360
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,701
- Anyway, happy for you guys.
- Sasha. I do not hate your fucking guts.

361
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:54,619
Oh, really?

362
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,289
Because you just described a fantasy
in which I do not exist.

363
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:02,418
- I'm an associate producer on this.
- It was an alternative universe.

364
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:03,963
And I swear to God...

365
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:18,519
I haven't seen Sasha that heated
since the <i>Star Wars</i> prequels.

366
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,813
He's in for a long night with Esther.

367
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,900
I don't think Sasha's the one
you need to be worried about right now.

368
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,194
Why don't we talk about
what's happening with us?

369
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,239
Of course. Yes, you're right.

370
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:41,667
Okay, listen.

371
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,043
Jo.

372
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:48,172
I'm so sorry. I should not have said
that it was an easy decision.

373
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,258
I'm just

374
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,594
a little confused, Noah. Um...

375
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,680
You seem to have one foot on the gas
and one foot on the brake.

376
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,558
And honestly, it's reminding me
of my previous relationships.

377
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:02,479
Am I not reading
the signs here properly? Um...

378
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:07,484
'Cause I assumed
that it was a difficult decision

379
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,403
because I thought
you wanted a future with me.

380
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:11,655
You know I want that.

381
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,116
Then

382
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:15,992
what's the problem?

383
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,828
I mean, I know it's fast,
but that's life, Noah.

384
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,955
I mean, I got evicted.
I need a place to live.

385
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:24,167
I'm in a happy, secure relationship.
Why wouldn't we move in together?

386
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:27,046
You know why. Because we haven't answered
the question of conversion yet.

387
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,797
Okay? And I am scared.

388
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:32,300
I am scared
that if we move in together now,

389
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,426
then that'll be it.

390
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:37,514
And we will never deal with the question
of conversion because we won't have to.

391
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,433
And I will be unhappy.

392
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:43,102
And maybe even resentful.
I don't know. I don't know.

393
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:47,065
<i>I don't see
The same look in your eyes...</i>

394
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:47,982
I don't know.

395
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:50,151
I mean, I feel like
I'm inching towards conversion,

396
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,612
but I... I can't guarantee it.

397
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:55,740
And what if it takes me
till I'm, like, 100?

398
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,535
Are we gonna be 100
and not living together?

399
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:03,122
If you can't move in with me as I am now,

400
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,291
I don't see how we do move forward.

401
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:09,170
Joanne, part of being in a relationship
is dealing with these issues.

402
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,296
And we will.

403
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,132
<i>It's hard to stay</i>

404
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:14,759
<i>Leaving hurts...</i>

405
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,719
I feel like
we've been saying that a lot lately.

406
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,763
<i>I'm not sure which one is...</i>

407
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,599
And what if we can't... figure it out?

408
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,517
<i>'Cause tonight...</i>

409
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:23,476
You know?

410
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:26,230
<i>The love I used to know...</i>

411
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,776
And what if we're just too afraid
to say that out loud?

412
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:32,986
Don't say it.

413
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:38,075
<i>Just how long it's been
I can't recall...</i>

414
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:42,829
Don't you think we deserve
to be in relationships

415
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:46,667
where we can both be exactly who we are

416
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,253
while still moving forward?

417
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,381
Maybe.

418
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,801
<i>I already miss</i>

419
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,513
<i>It's hard to stay</i>

420
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,599
<i>Leaving hurts</i>

421
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:07,855
<i>And I'm not sure
Which one is the worst</i>

422
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:13,694
<i>'Cause tonight I'll hold the love
I used to know</i>

423
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:19,116
<i>Listen to a heart letting go</i>

424
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:24,662
<i>When you decide to say goodbye</i>

425
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:29,125
<i>How am I supposed to live without you?</i>

426
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:32,129
<i>I don't know</i>

427
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:36,632
<i>Don't know why I'm holding on</i>

428
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:43,640
<i>We both know that you're already gone</i>

429
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,728
<i>It's hard to stay</i>

430
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:50,564
<i>Leaving hurts</i>

431
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:55,736
<i>And I'm not sure
Which one is the worst</i>

432
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:01,617
<i>' Cause tonight I'll hold the love
I used to know</i>

433
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:07,414
<i>Listen to a heart letting go</i>
