1
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,233
Here you go.

2
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,433
Are you sure about these?
The pool's up to 200.

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,990
I've made my choices.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,598
Confidence, an admirable trait.

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,079
- Clara.
- Hey, Jimmy.

6
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,836
- What do you got for me?
- I'm stuck on documentary, short subject.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,595
Yeah. Just go with your gut.

8
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,117
Howard's End all the way down, huh?

9
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,078
I just love Emma Thompson.

10
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,880
- Who doesn't?
- She's so pragmatic.

11
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,793
Yeah, well, fingers crossed.

12
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,997
- Hey, hey.
- Hey. How'd we do?

13
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,874
This is everything from two.

14
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,111
And I even got Chloe to throw in.

15
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,354
Many have tried to argue
with Kim Wexler, all have failed.

16
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,876
I'm headed up to four.
You got anything?

17
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,235
Yeah.

18
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,958
- And I'll do three.
- Already done.

19
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,715
You know, you're making
the rest of us look bad.

20
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,150
If you wouldn't stop
at every cubicle to chat...

21
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,789
It's called being friendly.
It's great for morale.

22
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,555
It is great for wasting time.

23
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,518
- That too.
- Okay, so...

24
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,149
Discovery for Cordero is coming in
this afternoon...

25
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,518
so you might wanna kick it up a bit.

26
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,840
Stop.

27
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,954
He really did it.

28
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,310
- What?
- Isaacson.

29
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,114
The case.

30
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,397
Isaacson v. Vakarian Holdings, Inc.

31
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,997
We've been assembling binders
for months.

32
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,676
I've been slammed with the Oscar pool,
in case you weren't paying attention.

33
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,360
Right. Sorry. I'll try harder.

34
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,398
So this guy, Isaacson,
he dies of a heart attack.

35
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,076
And his family, they're our clients,
sort through his financials...

36
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,471
looking to track his assets,
lo and behold...

37
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,515
they find some old shares
in this company he invested in...

38
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,797
like 20 years back.

39
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,713
Family tracks down the CFO...

40
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,759
looking to cash out,
but he tells them...

41
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,991
that corporation's been dissolved.

42
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,198
Isaacson's shares are worthless, right?

43
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,760
But Chuck does some digging.

44
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,357
Turns out, they formed a new corporation
that's virtually identical...

45
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,592
to the old corp Isaacson invested in.
It's the same officers...

46
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,831
same structure, everything.

47
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,512
Right? So Chuck finds exemption 4
in Leannais v. Cincinnati.

48
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,911
Okay, yeah, listen,
I appreciate the effort...

49
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,630
- but can you just big picture it for me?
- Shut up. I am.

50
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,914
Chuck won a case
Howard thought was unwinnable...

51
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,471
using only the power
of obscure case law.

52
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,636
And that's good?

53
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,519
Yeah, very.

54
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,990
- Congratulations, Mr. McGill.
- Jimmy.

55
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,038
- Chuck. Big day, huh?
- Yeah.

56
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,197
- Thanks...
- Kim Wexler.

57
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,718
- Of course. You're one of our students?
- Yes. Third year at UNM. Thanks to HHM.

58
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,155
How's it going?

59
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,357
Very well, thank you.

60
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,352
Congratulations, again, on Isaacson.

61
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,035
- Well...
- I'm sure that you considered it.

62
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,238
I wanted to ask, Vakarian Holdings Inc.
would have been liable...

63
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,040
under the continuing enterprise
exception as well?

64
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,112
That's right.
Yeah, we looked into that.

65
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,999
What was the case law on that?

66
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,480
Garcia v. Coe Manufacturing.

67
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,474
Sounds like it was Isaacson v. Chuck
Handing Him His Butt On A Platter, huh?

68
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,838
Well, yeah,
but Isaacson is our client.

69
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,311
Oh, really? Okay.
Well, the other guys' butts then.

70
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,915
Yeah. Served on platters. Right.
Thanks, Jimmy.

71
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,790
- Hail the conquering hero.
- Thanks, Howard.

72
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,712
I hate to interrupt, but there's
a Mr. Bushmills waiting in my office.

73
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,439
Kim. Jimmy.

74
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,591
That'll be you soon.

75
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,714
Yup.

76
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,040
Okay.

77
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,429
See you later, Jimmy.

78
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,233
See you.

79
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,877
Ben.
What've you got for me?

80
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,793
There's your winner.

81
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,913
Think Pacino's gonna "hooah" his way
to Oscar glory, huh?

82
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,799
Last call for ballots.

83
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:43,116
With respect to the zoning committee,
we maintain that the Mesa Verde statue...

84
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,994
should be exempt from
sign-code restrictions...

85
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,915
on size and location...

86
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,319
because it is a work of art.

87
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,550
Specifically, its function...

88
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,754
extends beyond furthering
the company's economic interests...

89
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,756
which distinguishes it from commercial
speech under legal precedent.

90
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,995
Viola, can you look up the relevant
case law here for me?

91
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,280
I'm...

92
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,638
I think it is maybe...

93
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,716
U.S. v. United Foods.

94
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,236
Yeah.

95
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,639
Morning.

96
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,877
Jimmy. Morning.

97
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,360
Oh, good morning.

98
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,637
I just was making the OJ.

99
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,519
I see that.

100
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,958
I didn't hear you come to bed.

101
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,595
I was up late justifying
a giant horse statue...

102
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,634
- to the Park City zoning commission.
- How big we talking?

103
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,710
I'm definitely overcompensating
for some other shortcoming big.

104
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,953
Your hours pretty much set now?

105
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,191
Yeah. Weekdays, 9 to 4.

106
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,273
- The busy time.
- Oh, yeah?

107
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,355
It's dead, Kim.
It's deader than disco.

108
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,670
Oh, sorry.

109
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,596
Does that mean you were able to schedule
an appointment with the therapist?

110
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,676
I decided not to go.

111
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,514
Okay.

112
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,394
I thought
you'd already decided to go?

113
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,398
I know. I did.

114
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,193
But then...

115
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,469
time went by
and I kind of calmed down...

116
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,712
and I realized it's just...
it's just not for me.

117
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,230
Why not?

118
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,912
It's just not.

119
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,038
I don't think that navel-gazing
is gonna get me where I need to be.

120
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,238
- Yeah, but how do you know...?
- Unless I try?

121
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,153
It just doesn't feel right.

122
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,277
I need to be moving forward, you know?

123
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,874
And now I got this job.

124
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,078
And I'm kind of on a path...

125
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,074
and just wanna give this a try.

126
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,356
Is that okay?

127
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,517
Sure.

128
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,319
Yeah. Of course, Jimmy.

129
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,832
Yeah, listen,
I know you wanted me to go.

130
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,435
You have to do what's best for you.

131
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,389
I should go open up.

132
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,559
Sushi tonight?

133
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,791
Yeah, that sounds great.

134
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,311
- Should be fine for Friday, I think?
- Yeah, Friday works.

135
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,000
Kim.

136
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,393
- Hello, Rich.
- So good to see you.

137
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,916
You too. Thanks for seeing me
on such short notice.

138
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,356
You kidding?
I've been wanting to thank you...

139
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,558
since you sent Billy Gatwood our way.
So shall we?

140
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,159
- So how long you got with that thing?
- Three more weeks.

141
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,119
Can I sign it?
Do people still do that?

142
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,191
Please have a seat. Have a seat.

143
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,079
I won't lie, losing Billy Gatwood
definitely hurt.

144
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,312
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
I think he misses you.

145
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,756
As long as he's taken care of,
I'm happy.

146
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,357
Well, you made it easy for us.
We just continued what you started.

147
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,874
So how's James holding up?

148
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,079
I didn't get to speak with him
at the funeral.

149
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,797
We're taking it one day at a time.

150
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,394
Grief moves at its own pace.

151
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,313
And it's different for everybody.

152
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,154
So give him my best.

153
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,356
Thank you.

154
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,398
So, what can I do for you?

155
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,149
I have a question for you.

156
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,755
How's your banking division?

157
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,349
Well, we have some banking work,
but I wouldn't say we have a division.

158
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,552
Would you like one?

159
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,394
Well, it's a good long way
from the rest of your operation.

160
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,359
It must remain completely separate.

161
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,316
Two bedrooms each.

162
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,592
Werner will probably take his own.

163
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,195
The rest of the guys can double up.

164
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,798
- Wired and plumbed?
- Yes.

165
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,390
This is a good start.

166
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,431
What do you have in mind?

167
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,877
Couple treadmills over there.

168
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,191
Barbells, weight bench.

169
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:31,116
You build out a stocked bar, beer on tap.
I mean, they're German, so...

170
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,714
Entertainment system here.

171
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,200
DVD player, projector and screen
set up might be nice.

172
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,637
A few La-Z-Boys or couches.

173
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,917
Pool table, I don't know, foosball?

174
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,710
Hell, we could even put up a hoop.
Germans play basketball, yeah?

175
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,792
I believe so.

176
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,273
Werner said that this was gonna take
six months...

177
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,229
which means eight, at least,
probably 10, in total isolation.

178
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,314
These guys are gonna be doing
10 hours heavy labor every day.

179
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,440
Or night. Then coming home to this.
We can't just keep them alive...

180
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,559
we gotta keep them
from climbing the walls.

181
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,792
Make a list.

182
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,397
Security.

183
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,559
I'd like a full-camera perimeter inside.
We'll keep it low profile.

184
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,475
They'll know we'll be watching, we just
don't need to stick it in their faces.

185
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,472
Outside too, obviously...

186
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:33,839
in case someone tries to find
a way in or out.

187
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,796
I'll put a sally port on that door.

188
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,909
We'll control it from the outside.

189
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,869
And we're gonna need a trailer
to monitor the cameras.

190
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,918
Close by...

191
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,276
two guys, 24-hour monitoring.

192
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,397
Work in shifts.

193
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,877
Let's say five guys, minimum.

194
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,840
Probably help to have
a couple German speakers as well.

195
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,673
I can provide you men.

196
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,832
I'm gonna need to vet them.
No offense.

197
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,150
Of course.

198
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,153
- What is it?
- Infection. Bad one.

199
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,559
I must leave.

200
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,359
Tell Tyrus what you need.

201
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,520
It will be done.

202
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,957
You got a pen?

203
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,273
- I'll remember.
- Yeah?

204
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,399
Treadmills. You wanna check
wholesale providers...

205
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,196
these guys are gonna tear
right through consumer-grade.

206
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,911
I'd love to see what something,
say, like...

207
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,675
a 24-footer would run me?

208
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,878
- Sorry, we just don't make them that big.
- Who does?

209
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,714
I can't think of anyone around here.

210
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:58,113
Well, who makes those
huge signs that the casinos have?

211
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,432
You know what, never mind.
Thank you very much.

212
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,555
Jimmy McGill.

213
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,076
Yes.
I'm looking for Jimmy McGill.

214
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,913
Yeah, you found him.

215
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,912
The lawyer?

216
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,151
Yeah.
What can I do for you?

217
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,959
My name's Brett Dunst.

218
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,839
I think you did my aunt's will?

219
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,835
At least, that's what it says here.
She... She died.

220
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,754
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Thanks. I'm the executor...

221
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,470
and I've distributed all her stuff,
but there's some finer details...

222
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,917
in this that are tricky.
I thought you could help me with those.

223
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,480
Who was your aunt?

224
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,109
Geraldine Strauss.

225
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,196
Oh, Mrs. Strauss passed away?
How?

226
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,754
She... She went in her sleep
a couple weeks ago. Heart failure.

227
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,233
Hello?

228
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,954
Did Clarence get
the Alpine Shepherd Boy?

229
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,873
I'm sorry?

230
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,673
The Hummel?

231
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,990
Oh, the little figure?

232
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,277
Yeah, yeah, he got it.

233
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,473
So he finished college then?

234
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,633
Yep. Just this last semester.

235
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,712
Good. That's... That's good.

236
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,916
How did you know?

237
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,152
Oh, because you did the will.
Right.

238
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,757
Is there a memorial?

239
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,355
Oh, sorry. It was last week.

240
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,834
Anyway, it's my busiest time at work,
and Angie's doing the best she can...

241
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,878
but I have to get back to Salt Lake.

242
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,876
Are you on an hourly rate or would
this be, like, a flat-fee kind of thing?

243
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,993
Mr. McGill?

244
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,190
I'm sorry. I...

245
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,835
I'm not practicing any longer.

246
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,992
Oh, darn it.

247
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,071
I can refer you though.

248
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,871
Hamlin Hamlin McGill has an excellent
estate law department...

249
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:05,233
and they'll help you sort things out.
Just ask for Francis Scheff.

250
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,278
He'll point you in the right direction.

251
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,636
Hamlin Hamlin McGill.

252
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:13,117
McGill? Wait, isn't that you?

253
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,478
It's just a coincidence.

254
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,990
All right, well, thank you,
Mr. McGill.

255
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,640
You bet.

256
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,118
Goddamn it.

257
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,676
My husband and I scrimped and saved
for so many years.

258
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,753
We did our best to build a nest egg
so that we wouldn't be...

259
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,917
a burden to our family.

260
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,790
After Ronald passed,
I moved to an assisted-living facility...

261
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,519
a nice place.

262
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,400
They told me
they'd take care of everything.

263
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,917
But then one day,
they said all my money was gone.

264
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,231
How could that be?

265
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,471
Where did it all go?

266
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,031
If you or a loved one is a resident
of the Sandpiper Crossing facility...

267
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,635
or other associated
retirement community...

268
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,919
you may be eligible to receive
compensation for a...

269
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,391
- Hey there.
- Hey.

270
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,199
Guess where I am?

271
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,589
Somewhere good?

272
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,991
Somewhere very good.

273
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,038
You could be here too.

274
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,151
- Hey there.
- Hey, Giselle.

275
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,279
I was thinking we could just be
Kim and Jimmy today.

276
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,635
Okay.

277
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,314
Those two aren't all bad.

278
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,629
Rumors and hearsay.
How's work?

279
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,439
It is a job.

280
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,320
And how about you? Work's good?

281
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,154
Yeah, actually. I have news.

282
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,279
Good news.
It's great news, really.

283
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,116
It could change things
for Wexler-McGill.

284
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,990
But I met with Rich Schweikart today.

285
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,594
- Really?
- Yeah.

286
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,832
Well, they took on Gatwood,
so I've been meaning to follow up.

287
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,754
And anyway, we were talking...

288
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,560
and he offered me a job.

289
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,949
Again?

290
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,999
What, he can't take no for an answer?

291
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,834
They want me to run
their banking division.

292
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,435
Build it, really.

293
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,796
You're not seriously considering it?

294
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,120
I'd be coming in as a partner.

295
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,235
But I thought things were going okay
with Mesa Verde since...

296
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,437
They are. They were.

297
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,310
My workload has gotten
a lot more complicated lately.

298
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,793
I've been taking on some pro bono work.
Overflow from the public defender's office.

299
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,034
PD overflow? When did you...?
Why...?

300
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,160
I like it.

301
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,552
I'm good at it.

302
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,919
And I'm helping people, Jimmy.

303
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,632
I know that sounds cheesy.
It's whatever, but it's the truth.

304
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,551
No, it makes a lot of sense.

305
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,433
I have been thinking
about criminal law myself lately.

306
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,752
You know,
for when I get my license back.

307
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,755
Really?

308
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,116
Yeah. You know, like you said...

309
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,000
you know, you're helping people.

310
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,639
I'm thinking an office in one of these
refurbished bungalows, you know...

311
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,919
downtown by the courts. Stick around
where all the people who need help are.

312
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,353
Boy.
It has a nice ring to it now.

313
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,672
Wexler-McGill, criminal law.

314
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,715
That all sounds great.

315
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,152
The thing is...

316
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,160
if I go to Schweikart & Cokely...

317
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,597
I have all those associates
to help cover Mesa Verde.

318
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,473
It'll keep paying the bills...

319
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,077
and free me up to do the work
I really care about.

320
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,992
So you'd kind of get to have
your cake and eat it too.

321
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,152
Kind of, yeah.

322
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,399
I'll be right back.

323
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,677
- No, Jimmy.
- What? I... No, I just...

324
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,752
I gotta hit the head.

325
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,990
I say do it.

326
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,677
It's a great opportunity
and you should jump on it.

327
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,960
- You mean that?
- Yeah.

328
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,635
Kim, you gotta do what's best for you.

329
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,753
You sure?

330
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,080
Yes.

331
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,438
I can't ask you to wait around for me.

332
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,195
And who knows?

333
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,398
Ten months, a lot can happen.

334
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,439
Yeah. Yeah. Who knows?

335
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:58,237
Yeah, so to Schweikart and Cokely,
and Wexler.

336
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,038
Hi.

337
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,800
I only have a few minutes.
I have to pick Kaylee up.

338
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,520
Okay.

339
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,029
What did you want to tell me, Mike?

340
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,232
I stand by what I said.

341
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,073
The guy's a charlatan.

342
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,200
But there's a time and there's a place,
and that wasn't it.

343
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,520
You left me quite the mess.

344
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,152
Yeah, I can see that.

345
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:30,070
It'll be okay, eventually.

346
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,794
Anita's not happy.
You might wanna call her.

347
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,396
Probably better if I don't.

348
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:44,319
You know that I would
never forget Matty.

349
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,193
I know.

350
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,830
No one expects you to wear
a hair shirt the rest of your life.

351
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,879
Same goes for you.

352
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,191
You and Kaylee okay?

353
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,759
We're good.

354
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,674
Then I'm good.

355
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,799
I was thinking...

356
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,873
maybe I could pick
Kaylee up from school tomorrow?

357
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,112
Yeah, that'd be a big help, Pop.

358
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,830
See you then.

359
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,394
Okay.

360
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,313
I don't know. I'd tell you.

361
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,557
Nobody's heard anything.

362
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,632
You can go in, Jimmy.
He's expecting you.

363
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,757
Thanks, Julie.

364
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,032
Oh, hey, Jimmy.

365
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,515
Howard.

366
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,320
This was going in the mail.
You would've got it Friday.

367
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,440
Yeah. I got a pressing need
only $5000 will cure.

368
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,398
There you go then.

369
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,399
Everything correct?

370
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,756
- Looks good. Thanks.
- Of course.

371
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,113
Hey, I see a lot of empty cubicles
out there. What's going on?

372
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,756
We're doing some reorganizing.

373
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,716
Just making the office
a little more feng shui, I take it?

374
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,033
We've had some setbacks.

375
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,874
Paying out to Chuck's estate?

376
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,274
That is part of it.

377
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,352
And to be frank...

378
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,315
the firm's reputation is...

379
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,596
not what it was.

380
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,353
So, what's the plan?

381
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:46,639
The consultants call it rightsizing.

382
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:52,355
No, I mean, what's the plan
to get HHM back on its feet?

383
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,231
Are you kidding me?
I just referred a client to you guys.

384
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,918
You're welcome, by the way.
You tell me this place is falling apart?

385
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,958
Get your shit together, Howard.

386
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,160
- Excuse me?
- Oh, please.

387
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,400
You suffer one little setback and
you're gonna let your entire legacy go?

388
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,710
One little setback?

389
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,315
Fine, your pain is very special.

390
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,597
Woe is you. Just stop wallowing.

391
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,150
Okay?
This place is all you've got.

392
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,030
That and your hair, which, let's face it,
the clock's ticking there too, so...

393
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,954
You wanna save your business?
You wanna save your dignity?

394
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,999
You're gonna have to fight.
Hey.

395
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,352
You're a shitty lawyer, Howard.

396
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,392
But you're a great salesman.

397
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,910
So get out there and sell.

398
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,120
Fuck you, Jimmy.

399
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,034
There you go. Use that.

400
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,673
- It's $4000. Plus tip.
- There you go. Thank you very much.

401
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,991
- Pleasure doing business.
- You as well.

402
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,596
All set over here.
You got a spot yet?

403
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,592
Piñatas? Are you kidding?

404
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,712
No, no, that could...
could work, yeah.

405
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,671
Regardless, we have full run
of the place? There's no prying eyes?

406
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,319
All right. Well, that's it then.

407
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,751
Yeah, she's fine.

408
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,198
Yeah, I change half the water
in the tank every week.

409
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,033
She's good.

410
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,999
No, I know. Don't overfeed.

411
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,356
All right. Goodbye.

412
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,672
What are you doing?

413
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,713
Mrs. Nguyen.

414
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,237
Just, you know,
step right on in anytime, you know?

415
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,511
What's all this?

416
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,193
It's a side business.

417
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,471
I thought you were a lawyer.

418
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,472
I've had a temporary setback.

419
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,758
Lost your job again?

420
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,196
Did you need something, Mrs. Nguyen?

421
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,280
I don't want people coming in and out
to buy your phones.

422
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,909
I won't sell them out of the office,
so don't worry.

423
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,560
You can't keep them here.

424
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,599
I pay rent for this place.
I can do whatever I want with it.

425
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,194
They're a fire hazard.

426
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,478
Well, they're not gonna be here
very long, okay?

427
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,956
That's... That's on me.

428
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:44,080
No, it's prepaid, 350 minutes.

429
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,718
Get-rich-quick schemes never work.

430
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,637
Just watch me.

431
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,997
The doctor tells me
your fever has gotten worse.

432
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,719
They say this infection may kill you.

433
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,150
Even if it doesn't...

434
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,795
my doctor tells me again and again
that you may never wake.

435
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,952
And yet...

436
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,238
I wait.

437
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,433
I grew up quite poor.

438
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,556
We lived in the hills.

439
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,673
In a place my brothers built
from things they found.

440
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:19,111
Metal sheeting, plywood.

441
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:24,190
When it rained, it smelled like hay.

442
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,116
We were always hungry.

443
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,954
But there was a lucuma tree.

444
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,318
Scrawny. Barely alive.

445
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,679
My family had given up on it
years before.

446
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,036
Never bore fruit.

447
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,711
When I was 7...

448
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,596
I became fixated on it.

449
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,392
I watered it...

450
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,358
tended to it.

451
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,751
It took a long time.

452
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:03,715
But the buds grew into green fruit.

453
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,111
I was so proud.

454
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,634
I didn't tell anyone.

455
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,713
I plucked one
and hid behind our shack.

456
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,798
I ate the whole thing.

457
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,512
I'd never tasted something so sweet.

458
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:21,874
It was like caramel.

459
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,673
At first, we ate the fruit ourselves.

460
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:30,197
And then I began
taking it to the village to sell.

461
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:37,073
One day, much of the fruit
was gone from my tree.

462
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:44,152
Pieces were scattered on the ground,
half-eaten.

463
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,357
I thought it was probably a coati.

464
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,957
Have you ever seen one?

465
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:59,998
About the size of a large house cat.

466
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,510
Opportunists.

467
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,757
I built a snare...

468
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,276
using branches and wire.

469
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,712
It didn't take long
for the animal to set it off.

470
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,554
But the coati thrashed so hard...

471
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,235
it broke out of the snare.

472
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,671
Broke its leg as well.

473
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,197
I tried to grab it...

474
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,478
but it slipped away.

475
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,950
It ran under the house.

476
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:36,078
I knew it would show itself
sooner or later.

477
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,957
So I waited.

478
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,517
For hours.

479
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,791
Into the night.

480
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,675
When my brothers called for me...

481
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,153
I did not answer.

482
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,591
I didn't make a sound.

483
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,036
I was so still.

484
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:08,353
Finally, it came out.

485
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,160
It knew I was there...

486
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,357
but it was hungry.

487
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,758
This time...

488
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,798
I was ready.

489
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,677
I caught it.

490
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,631
It fought me...

491
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,080
but I was stronger.

492
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,392
The merciful thing
would've been to kill it.

493
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,111
I kept it.

494
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,515
It lived for quite some time.

495
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:04,073
I believe you will wake, Hector.

496
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,675
This is huge.

497
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,950
Crazy.

498
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,919
I'm starving. I hope
there's something in the kitchen.

499
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,196
You idiot, should've eaten
on the plane.

500
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,638
Is that a bar?

501
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,194
It is. Wonder what's on tap.

502
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,830
We're here to work.
Why do we need a bar?

503
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,874
Because we're here to work.

504
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:34,632
All right, gentlemen,
we have a few things to go over here.

505
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,915
That means you too.

506
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,593
Kai.

507
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,593
Over here, Kai.

508
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,834
Enough!

509
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:57,238
For what they're paying you,
you'll listen.

510
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,314
We got four bedrooms
between the two houses.

511
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,315
I leave it to you to figure out
the roommate situation.

512
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:21,037
I assume you're all friends, I don't
really wanna hear about it if you aren't.

513
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,874
Working kitchens, so you can cook
whatever you want.

514
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,477
The refrigerator, the cabinets
are stocked with the essentials.

515
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:33,352
There's a shopping list. Write down
whatever you need and we'll get it.

516
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,592
There is a phone in each house.

517
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,310
It goes directly to me
or one of my guys.

518
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,995
Anything you need, call.

519
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,670
So when do the girls get here?

520
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,915
Anything within reason.

521
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,471
Any more questions?

522
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,155
All right, you've got some time to relax
and settle in.

523
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,109
Work starts tomorrow night.

524
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,673
Michael.

525
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,679
They all are good boys.

526
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:26,318
Once the work begins, they focus.
I'll see to it.

527
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,158
What you've done here
is very impressive.

528
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,789
- Thank you for that, Michael.
- Hey.

529
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,240
If you need anything to make
this go better, let me know.

530
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,471
I will, certainly.

531
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,757
- Hey, Mike.
- Hey.

532
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,590
Keep an eye on this one.

533
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,440
Hey.

534
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,955
I come in peace.

535
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,120
I'm just...
just here to make a deal.

536
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,473
What kind of deal?

537
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:25,316
Look, fellas, we...
we got off on the wrong foot.

538
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,120
I'm sure you saw me here
selling my wares and thought...

539
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:32,194
I was just some rube out
looking to score a quick buck...

540
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:37,480
and just begging to be rolled.
But, guys, I'm thinking long-term.

541
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:42,880
I see a real need in this community
for safe, affordable, untraceable phones...

542
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,236
and I'm ready to fill it.

543
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,239
All right.
All right, straight talk.

544
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:55,117
I need to be able to sell my phones
without worrying about getting ripped off.

545
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:00,592
I'm proposing if you let me sell
my phones without hassle, I cut you in.

546
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:05,073
Say, a hundred bucks
every night that I'm out?

547
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:09,029
And that's money
for literally doing nothing.

548
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,715
Why wouldn't we just take all of it?

549
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:21,595
Because I'm talking consistent,
reliable profits, you know?

550
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,390
Sure, you can rip me off again,
take all that I've got.

551
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:30,470
But then I stop selling,
and you lose a valuable revenue stream.

552
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,832
Give me all you got. Now.

553
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,959
I'm trying to make money
for all of us here. Just work with me.

554
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:44,836
- Give.
- If you'd just expand your thinking a little.

555
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,838
You talk too much.

556
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,795
All right, all right.
We got a man of action.

557
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,351
You should've taken the deal.

558
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:27,150
You're, like, the stupidest person
I've ever met.

559
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,352
Didn't know I had friends, did you?

560
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,878
So, what's it gonna be?
Fast or slow?

561
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,396
It's gonna hurt like a bitch
either way.

562
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:33,351
What was that? Was it slow?

563
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,555
Let me...

564
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,997
We're sorry, man, all right?
We're sorry.

565
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,878
Yeah, you are. Very much so.

566
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,760
We'll leave you alone.
We won't mess with you anymore.

567
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,673
Easy to say now.
What about tomorrow?

568
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:51,674
I'll swear, man.
I'll swear on anything you want me to.

569
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:57,431
- Cross your heart and hope to die?
- Yes. Yes, man.

570
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,556
You mean it?

571
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,956
Yes. Yes.

572
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:06,113
Look, after this,
you'll never have to see us again.

573
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:09,229
And you will spread the word
that I'm off-limits?

574
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,710
Yes, yes, yes. We'll tell everyone.

575
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:15,430
We'll say... Don't... Don't...
Don't mess with the cell-phone guy.

576
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,672
All right. We're done.

577
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,270
We're done.

578
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,873
I think they get it.

579
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,633
Seriously, guys, we're done.

580
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:33,157
Okay, we're good. All right?
That's enough.

581
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:36,519
I appreciate the enthusiasm...

582
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,751
- but they got the message.
- That's right.

583
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,714
Listen to what he says.
I got the message.

584
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,640
All right, you know what,
if it's that important to you...

585
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:47,435
- go ahead.
- No, no, no. Please.

586
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,917
No, no, please, please.

587
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,715
No, no, no. Please.
Please, no!

588
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:17,271
You get one warning.

589
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:20,353
And that was it.
