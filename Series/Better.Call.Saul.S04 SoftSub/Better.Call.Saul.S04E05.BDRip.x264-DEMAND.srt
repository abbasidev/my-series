1
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,113
Damn it.

2
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,072
Come on.

3
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,953
Is this the one?

4
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,512
Jackpot.

5
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,034
- It's all here.
- Meaning what, exactly?

6
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,635
Meaning, you know, field mice...

7
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,760
and you got your nest-building squirrel,
you got your whatever.

8
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,435
Three cheers for morality.

9
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,270
- Hey, where's the...?
- What?

10
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,794
You know, the...

11
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,516
Use your words.

12
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,590
Did you shred the files
under your desk?

13
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,031
- Yes.
- Okay.

14
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,078
- What about your Rolodex?
- Yes. And everything in the cabinets...

15
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,993
- The safe...
- Stuff in the bathroom?

16
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,915
- You did that yourself, remember?
- Right, right.

17
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,109
- All right. That's it. I'm going.
- Do me a favor.

18
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,920
Take those, drop them off
at least five miles from here.

19
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,231
In separate dumpsters.

20
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,879
Oh, right.

21
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,199
Fine.

22
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,994
Okay, when the cops come talk to you,
what are you gonna tell them?

23
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,356
- Talk to my attorney.
- Yeah.

24
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,319
Tell them that Jimmy sent you.

25
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,996
Okay? Where you gonna be
November 12th at 3 p.m.?

26
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,914
I'll be there. If it doesn't ring at 3,
I'm gone.

27
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,673
Don't worry, it's gonna ring.

28
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,834
Well...

29
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,112
I guess...

30
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,553
that's it.

31
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,514
Quite a ride, huh?

32
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,714
Yup.

33
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,755
I need a new dust filter...

34
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,709
for my Hoover Max Extract
Pressure Pro, model 60.

35
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,031
Can you help me with that?

36
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,753
Pickup.

37
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,591
How hot? Red-hot.

38
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,639
I know where that is.
I'll be there.

39
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,709
Yep, maximum privacy.

40
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,156
It's the best money can buy.

41
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,995
Ten? No, can't do it.

42
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,879
Everyone wants these things.

43
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,440
Six?

44
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,674
Yeah. I can do six.
Okay, see you later.

45
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,753
Welcome to CC Mobile.

46
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,874
Sorry to keep you waiting,
what can I do for you?

47
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,558
So privacy sold here?

48
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,355
Yup. This is the place.

49
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,670
Privacy from who?

50
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,952
Come on. You know.

51
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,432
Like the government?

52
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,594
Could be.

53
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,672
Like the IRS?

54
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,719
Bingo.

55
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,156
- So?
- So...

56
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,676
say you got a cash-based business.

57
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,320
Like a contracting business?

58
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,356
Contracting?
Could be. Could be.

59
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,673
Maybe you don't report every
single penny. I mean, who does, right?

60
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,872
How are you doing business?
On the phone.

61
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,236
How are you scheduling appointments?

62
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,551
On the phone.
How are you arranging payments?

63
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,150
On the phone.
And who's listening?

64
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,279
That's right.
They know every lick and tittle.

65
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,478
So you're living your life free
and easy and then one day...

66
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,950
at the time of their choosing, bam.

67
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,112
They bring the hammer down
to Chinatown.

68
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,794
Jesus.

69
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,155
Jesus is right.

70
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,556
I'm telling you,
these guys don't fool around.

71
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,918
And they will clean your bones
faster than a school of piranhas.

72
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,874
I'll tell you what I'd do.

73
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:18,239
I'd practice something
we call information hygiene.

74
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,878
Can't be traced. Can't be tracked.

75
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,475
That'll keep you clean as a whistle.

76
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,916
What they don't know can't hurt you.

77
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,118
Especially if you use it only once per.

78
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,192
That's kind of key.

79
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,433
Once per?

80
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,150
Once per what?

81
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,917
Once per week,
once per day, once per call.

82
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,198
Depends on the nature of your situation.

83
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,356
How much are they?

84
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,391
Cheaper than an audit.
Guaranteed.

85
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,031
Unfortunately...

86
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,516
What?

87
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,592
Well, this one's spoken for.

88
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,912
My supply is very short.

89
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:11,438
Now, people are gobbling these up
like Tic Tacs.

90
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,953
Thanks again.

91
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,798
Tell your friends.

92
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,757
- Hello?
- Welcome to the U.S.A.

93
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,834
Use the prepaid parking ticket
in the cup holder to exit the lot.

94
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,596
Make a right, follow the signs
for I-70 West. Got it?

95
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,319
Seventy headed west, yes.

96
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,473
Keep the phone close by and
I'll call you in about 20 minutes...

97
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,919
- and talk you through the rest. Okay?
- I understand, yes.

98
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,273
Yes. I'm here.

99
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,557
Mark 238.

100
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,951
But there's nobody here.

101
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,918
You need to relieve yourself?

102
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,514
No.

103
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,313
- Where are you?
- You sure?

104
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,120
Because if you do,
I suggest you do it now.

105
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,114
You're not going to have
another chance for a while.

106
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,591
- As I said, I'm fine.
- Suit yourself.

107
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,992
Pop the trunk.
Inside, you'll see a hood.

108
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,836
Take it out, close the trunk,
place your luggage next to you...

109
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,753
and put the hood on.

110
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,149
That clear?

111
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,159
You want me to stand here
with a hood on my head?

112
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,670
Those are the rules.

113
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,472
Step forward.

114
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,117
We're gonna hit some rough road.

115
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:56,399
There's a strap for you to hold on to
if you reach out to your left.

116
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,276
You want some water?

117
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,113
No, thanks.

118
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,513
Step down, then walk.

119
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,034
There are stairs.

120
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,873
Step up.

121
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,952
Forward.

122
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,238
That's good. Right there.

123
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,633
Hi.

124
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,312
Where, exactly?

125
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,799
The entrance will be back there.

126
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,720
You need to stay within
the footprint of the building.

127
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,318
All right.

128
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,759
You can do it?

129
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,479
Absolutely.

130
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,597
How long will it take?

131
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,117
Kind of wanna say seven months,
but I think I could do it in six.

132
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,080
Even with blasting?

133
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,159
Well, the geologist report
was very thorough.

134
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,750
With the right equipment,
modern methods...

135
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,594
blasting will be quite unnecessary.

136
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,595
Assuming your employer
is willing to meet my price.

137
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,835
Price isn't an issue.

138
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,796
So...

139
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,357
Fifty-six feet down, with no blasting,
working nights only...

140
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,989
you're saying seven months max.

141
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:55,120
My men and I dug a tunnel under
the border into Downtown El Paso...

142
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,795
three-quarters of a kilometer long.

143
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,960
Undetected.

144
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,471
That took us 17 weeks.

145
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,671
If I can do that,
I can certainly do this.

146
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,233
Yeah?

147
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,959
Yeah.

148
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,112
That's what I thought.

149
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,239
Thank you for your time.

150
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,560
Pardon?

151
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,750
Pull the short end.

152
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,800
- It's too tight.
- Live with it.

153
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,112
Where do you look
when the judge talks?

154
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,551
- In the eyes.
- And what do you call the judge?

155
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,393
- Sir?
- Ma'am.

156
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,314
Or, better still, Your Honor.

157
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,679
Sit over there.

158
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,194
And leave that alone.

159
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,190
Not guilty?

160
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,353
You can't be serious. What planet
would you take this to trial?

161
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,512
You should work with me on this one.

162
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,878
Kid threw a cinder block through
a store window. I have a witness.

163
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,157
Frankly, I'm being generous.

164
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,392
I want six months probation,
time served, no jail.

165
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,593
And I wanna win the lottery.

166
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,355
- And breed labradoodles.
- Nice try, Bill.

167
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,791
- You won't get away with it.
- Away with what?

168
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,160
Come on. You're not
gonna play dumb, are you?

169
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,192
Please, enlighten me.

170
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,232
The officers took
the first part of my

171
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,312
guy's statement before
he was mirandized.

172
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,200
They collected evidence
based on that interview.

173
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:26,195
- And you knew all about it.
- That's irrelevant.

174
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,034
How would you...?
Why would you even...?

175
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,240
Your guy did it.

176
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,040
Bill, you don't want me
to bring this up with the judge.

177
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,876
Not only will your case be DOA,
but she will rip you a new one.

178
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,076
On the record.

179
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,840
- Judge is not buying any of that.
- I think she will.

180
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,957
It's all right here.

181
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,918
Listen, I...

182
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,919
Okay.

183
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,470
- Ten months jail.
- Six months probation.

184
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,359
Time served.

185
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,876
This kid needs a chance
to turn his life around...

186
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,271
not rot in prison and join a gang.

187
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,831
Are you joking?
We started at 18 months jail.

188
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,037
Up to you.

189
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,797
Eight months jail.

190
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,440
Four months probation.

191
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,718
- But what happened to six?
- You're annoying me.

192
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,556
You can't play chicken with me.
I invented chicken.

193
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,873
Okay.

194
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,833
Fine.

195
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,829
Six months jail time,
one year probation.

196
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,832
I can't make four months fly.

197
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,829
It's impossible.
Completely impossible.

198
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,074
You don't have time for this.

199
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,711
Bill, I only have one other client,
and it's a bank.

200
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,513
I have all the time in the world.

201
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,151
All rise for the honorable Judge Lipitz.

202
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,870
- CR2003114721...
- Fine. Four months.

203
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,397
- Four months probation.
- State v. David Estrada.

204
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,439
- Yes.
- Good morning.

205
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,398
Please be seated.

206
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,434
If I may, Your Honor.

207
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,114
Yes, Ms. Wexler.

208
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,194
I'm happy to say the defense and
prosecution have reached an agreement.

209
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,239
Hey, wait, no. Stand still.
This is mine, remember?

210
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,751
I don't mean to rush you, but the
meeting's in 15, and the traffic's...

211
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,116
Okay. Got it. Thanks.

212
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,710
I'm gonna have a probation officer
on my ass for four months?

213
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:59,394
David, listen to me.
Here's what you're gonna do.

214
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,394
After you leave here,
go to your grandfather's restaurant...

215
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,358
and you beg him for a job.

216
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,594
Any job. If he tells you
to scrub the grill, scrub the grill.

217
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,400
He tells you to clean the toilet,
you clean the toilet.

218
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,313
You will show up on time.

219
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,632
You will smile. You will say
please and thank you.

220
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,238
You will keep your nose clean,
you understand?

221
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,952
Because if you don't,
you will go to jail.

222
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,593
Grown-up jail, with grown-up bad guys.
Picture that, David.

223
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,158
Really picture it.

224
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,509
And know this, I'm not gonna do
a damn thing about it next time.

225
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,679
You got it?

226
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,994
Okay.

227
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,391
Nope. No.

228
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,517
No. Nope.

229
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,114
Wait, wait. Hey, look.

230
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,639
Doctor Zhivago is about to start.

231
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:08,197
Lots of attractive men in the snow.

232
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,636
That's your favorite genre.

233
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,876
I'm sorry, I can't. I have tons
of Mesa Verde to catch up on.

234
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,670
- Isn't that why you have a paralegal?
- Well, I have to review her work.

235
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,593
You watch.

236
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,240
Thanks.

237
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,392
Can you work with the TV on?

238
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,758
I have tremendous powers
of concentration.

239
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,515
Go ahead, it's fine.

240
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,876
It wasn't bothering me.

241
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:34,199
Yeah, I know. I just realized there's
something I need to do at work.

242
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,716
At 9:00 at night?

243
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,394
Well, it's my first week.

244
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,752
Wanna make a good impression.
Getting the hang of the system, so...

245
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,832
Okay.
I'll just go in the bedroom.

246
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,358
Absolutely not. You have work,
I have work. It's okay.

247
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,074
- Okay.
- It's all good. Don't wait up.

248
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,834
Hey, how's it going?

249
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,719
How are you guys set for phones?

250
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,314
We got phones.

251
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,517
Private phones.

252
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,273
Beat it, narc.

253
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,194
Oh, come on. Would a narc
drive this piece of shit?

254
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,235
Take it back to impound, narc.

255
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,916
Loser.

256
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,238
Hi, how are you?

257
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,154
That's a beautiful ride.

258
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,597
Hey, how's it going?

259
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,035
You get...?

260
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,510
You get that ink in Los Lunas?

261
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,913
Las Cruces.

262
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,997
Off by one.

263
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,357
And you've been inside?

264
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,358
No, I haven't had the honor,
but I used to be a lawyer.

265
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,637
Emphasis on used to be.

266
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,430
And I helped a lot of gentlemen
such as yourself, and your friends here.

267
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,990
One thing I learned from working
with my clients...

268
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:43,517
in the New Mexico corrections system
is that private conversations...

269
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:47,390
are few and far between.
The man is always listening...

270
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,950
on those landlines, so...

271
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,999
Word to the wise, if you wanna talk
to your friends on the inside...

272
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,311
there is a simple solution.

273
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,079
Yeah?

274
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,193
What's that?

275
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,879
This little baby.

276
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,430
It's the most compact model
on the market...

277
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,116
it can be hidden
in any number of places.

278
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:18,196
And if you buy it from me, with cash,
it's completely untraceable.

279
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,600
How much?

280
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,754
Keep the rubber side down.

281
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,793
Sorry, guys, you had your chance.
I'm all sold out.

282
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,360
Give me your money.

283
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,950
I'm a narc, remember?

284
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,839
We saw you got cash.

285
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,713
- Hand it over.
- Nice try.

286
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,391
Look, Pee Wee, Scooter, Skippy,
it was very good to meet you boys.

287
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,234
Good luck with the junior
achievement project.

288
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,880
I gotta go.

289
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,157
Hey, hey.

290
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,479
Get it. Go, go, go.

291
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,359
Come on, man.

292
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,640
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to wake you.

293
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,593
It's okay.

294
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,671
What happened?

295
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,638
I got mugged.

296
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,433
Jesus, that's cold.

297
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,671
So? Keep it on there.

298
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,393
You sure you don't
wanna go to the ER?

299
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:51,029
I'm fine. Really.

300
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,830
What are you doing?

301
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,720
Checking that your pupils
are the same size.

302
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,640
I'm okay. I swear.

303
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,439
Sorry.

304
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,510
Look at us.
We're like a Mathew Brady photo.

305
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:34,310
Yeah, I think you'd need
a cannon to really sell that.

306
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,236
So this happened at the Dog House?

307
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,720
Yeah.

308
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,278
At 1:30 in the morning?

309
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,753
I lost track of time.

310
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,358
And I parked too far away, so...

311
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,917
I was just dumb.

312
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,557
- Did you call the police?
- Nah. What's the point?

313
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,310
Anyway, I don't feel like spending
the rest of the night downtown...

314
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,951
looking at mug shots
of kids with stringy hair.

315
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,595
The hell's the matter with me?

316
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,438
It sounds like you were just
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

317
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:27,075
Back in the day, I would've spotted
those low-rent, little skeeves a mile away.

318
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,800
And they would've known
not to roll me.

319
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,515
Yeah? How would they
have known that?

320
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,273
I don't know.

321
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,151
Because back then...

322
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,395
I guess I was one of them.

323
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,671
Well, those days are over.

324
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,639
Yeah.

325
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,553
But...

326
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,394
What?

327
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,119
You know what? I think tomorrow...

328
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,193
I might call...

329
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,079
that shrink.

330
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,872
Couldn't hurt, right?

331
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,719
Couldn't hurt.

332
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,832
Denise.

333
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,071
It's Kim Wexler.

334
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,313
Denise.

335
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,670
Why are you still here?

336
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,833
You were supposed to meet me
in court an hour ago.

337
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,800
- So I missed it, right?
- Not yet.

338
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:21,636
I got the clerk to push your hearing,
but we've gotta go now.

339
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,637
I can't.

340
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,197
I'm freaking out.

341
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,795
I'm sorry, Ms. Wexler...

342
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,560
but I can't go to jail.

343
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,360
I can't promise you no jail time.

344
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:51,839
But what I do know is that if you don't
come with me right now to court...

345
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,356
the judge is gonna issue
a bench warrant.

346
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,598
And then jail is a done deal.

347
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,270
Denise, you can do this.

348
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,391
It's your first offense.

349
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,995
It was under two ounces.

350
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,990
Trust me, I'm good at this.

351
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,715
Why don't you change
into something nice?

352
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,352
We'll do this together.

353
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,111
- Hi, Paige.
- Kim. We've got a huge problem.

354
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,159
There's a major error in the branch
paperwork that went out...

355
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,870
to Denver and Flagstaff.
It has to be fixed, ASAP.

356
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:03,477
Unfortunately, I'm right in the middle
of something. I can be there at 4.

357
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,916
- I need you now.
- I'm sorry, I can't.

358
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,073
I don't know what to tell you, Paige.
I just... Not right now.

359
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,630
- But, Kim, this is a...
- I'm sorry.

360
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,595
Denise, it's time.

361
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,437
Come on. We gotta go.

362
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,193
- You look great.
- Thanks.

363
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,990
All right. Let's go get them.

364
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,074
Paige. I'm so sorry.

365
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,596
- Let's get this fixed right now.
- It's fixed.

366
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,559
I had to pull everyone to retype
and proof the submission...

367
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:03,873
because we didn't have the files. Your
paralegal didn't know where they were.

368
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,714
I'd really like to apologize to Kevin
if he's available.

369
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,360
He's not.

370
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,719
Let me be very clear.

371
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:15,317
The mistake is not the issue here.
Everyone makes mistakes.

372
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:19,793
But I need to know your head is in this.

373
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,199
You made a promise that Mesa Verde
would be your sole focus.

374
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,432
When we need you, we need you.

375
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,360
We're not a client you hang up on.

376
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,871
I'm really sorry, Paige.

377
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,392
It'll never happen again.

378
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,319
I hope not.

379
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,554
Speak English, please.

380
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,355
I'm going to throw up.

381
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,712
I suggest you don't.

382
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,634
Hold on. We're almost there.

383
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,035
Thank you.

384
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,196
You okay?

385
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,519
Better.

386
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,959
Pardon.

387
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,430
I take the Dramamine...

388
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,711
but it doesn't help.

389
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,800
Okay.

390
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,793
Over there?

391
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,713
Over there.

392
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,991
How am I supposed to do that?

393
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,234
So?

394
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,400
Before I can begin excavation...

395
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,871
I must support
the existing structure...

396
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,271
to avoid a cave-in.

397
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,431
Normally, this would involve
a piling rig...

398
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,956
working from above.

399
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:36,357
But there can be no activity
visible from the surface.

400
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:43,676
So I must construct secant walls...

401
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:48,198
of CFA piles,
working completely underground.

402
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,160
Difficult.

403
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:59,954
Next, I must somehow place I beams
across the top of the secant walls...

404
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:02,510
to support the floor...

405
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,992
and the machinery.

406
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,598
Excuse me.

407
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,719
Only now can I fully excavate.

408
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:27,957
I will need to move, perhaps,
1700 cubic meters of dirt.

409
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:32,239
That means trucking out
about 200 loads.

410
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:42,309
Going this deep,
we will surely hit rock...

411
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,915
which means blasting.

412
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:55,798
I will need schematics
of utility in the area.

413
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,275
You'll get those.

414
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,433
Once the space is fully cleared,
I can waterproof...

415
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:05,311
then fabricate casts for
the retaining walls and pour concrete.

416
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,278
We would need...

417
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:16,553
about 150 cubic meters.

418
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,713
This is just the beginning.

419
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,399
And all this in complete secrecy.

420
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,996
Judging from the sounds I heard,
I assume we are not far from a town?

421
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:34,873
This also is not optimal.

422
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,870
A project like this...

423
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:42,271
many, many things can go wrong.

424
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:59,034
So it's impossible?

425
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:03,834
Dangerous. Difficult.

426
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,876
And very, very expensive.

427
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,199
Not quite impossible.

428
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:13,514
Gustavo Fring.

429
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,558
A pleasure to make
your acquaintance.

430
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:19,997
Werner Ziegler.

431
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,319
You're good.

432
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,397
- See you, Marty.
- See you, Jimmy.

433
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,031
- Ready for me?
- Okay, next.

434
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:45,715
Howard?

435
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,152
Everything okay?

436
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:54,192
Everything's fine.

437
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,273
And how are you doing?

438
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,955
I've been better.
I'm heading up to the DA's office...

439
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:01,954
for my PPD check-in,
so, you know...

440
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:04,309
Yeah.

441
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,994
Anyway...

442
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,911
You sure you're okay?

443
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,191
I'm supposed to be in court...

444
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,593
in about 25 minutes.

445
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:25,514
- Big case?
- Not particularly.

446
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,392
So, what's up?

447
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:31,715
Nothing. Just...

448
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,156
You ever have insomnia?

449
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:39,279
Not really.

450
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:42,390
Wouldn't wish it on the worst enemy.

451
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:48,879
Don't they have pills for that?

452
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:55,039
I'm sorry, I gotta ask.

453
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,995
What's...? What's eating you?

454
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,839
Jimmy.

455
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,557
I think I've shared enough.

456
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,871
More than enough.

457
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,592
Let's leave it at that.

458
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,959
I get it.

459
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:28,036
You know what, Howard. You do yourself
a favor and you go see someone.

460
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:32,114
I actually have the number of a shrink.
I got it for a client.

461
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,237
He's supposed to be great.

462
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,073
I think...

463
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,995
Got it right here, actually.

464
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,629
Thanks, but I'm already
seeing someone.

465
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,879
- Really?
- Twice a week.

466
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,437
Is he any good?

467
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,719
Yes.

468
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:59,317
- Good seeing you, Howard.
- You too.

469
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:45,716
Can you hold please?
Thank you.

470
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:54,077
So where were we?

471
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,754
Community service.

472
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:59,319
Community service. Right.

473
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:03,279
- Looks like you completed your hours.
- Yep.

474
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,194
Your PPD fees are up-to-date.

475
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:09,432
And you've recently procured
lawful employment at...?

476
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,159
CC Mobile.

477
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:12,999
Address?

478
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:16,073
8351 Louisiana Boulevard.

479
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:19,796
8351 Louisiana.

480
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,113
How many hours a week?

481
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,476
This week, 31.
But I'll pick up more.

482
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,792
- Next month, bring pay stubs.
- Will do.

483
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:34,116
Are you associating
with any known criminals?

484
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,794
No.

485
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,474
All right.

486
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,512
Month two looks good.

487
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,151
Have you thought about what
you're gonna do once your PPD is up?

488
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:48,156
I have some plans.

489
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,714
Okay.

490
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,999
Such as?

491
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:58,709
Until then, I'll show up here
every second Monday of the month...

492
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,200
like clockwork.

493
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:03,115
I'm gonna keep my job
at the cell phone store...

494
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:07,718
and in nine months and 24 days,
I will get my law license back.

495
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:10,793
My partner and I,
we'll get a new office.

496
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,117
It'll be like it was...

497
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,957
but bigger and better.

498
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,192
Everything will be better.

499
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:22,159
I'm gonna have more clients,
I'm gonna win more cases.

500
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,039
I'm gonna be a damn good lawyer.

501
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:27,034
- And people are gonna know about it.
- Okay.

502
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:30,320
So lawyer.

503
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,154
Yeah.

504
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,520
Lawyer.
