1
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,799
The chair...

2
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,792
You made it. Come on in.

3
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,635
Picture a reception desk right here.

4
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,793
Right? It's always nice to be greeted
by a friendly face.

5
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,590
Now, over in this corner,
we got a fireplace.

6
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,911
With a cozy waiting area.

7
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,271
Couch, couple chairs.

8
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,760
Watercooler.

9
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,759
Electric kettle,
maybe an assortment of teas.

10
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,475
This is my office in here.

11
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,599
Guess what, these are all
original fixtures.

12
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,439
So that's...

13
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,949
We're four blocks from the courthouse.
So how convenient is that?

14
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,433
Now, there's a bathroom,
and it's... it's cute.

15
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,513
We're gonna get that cleaned out.

16
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,469
There's a shower in there when
you're buried in discovery late at night.

17
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,040
This is for the partner.

18
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,754
Corner office.

19
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,718
Lots of natural light.

20
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,159
And that's great
for your circadian rhythms.

21
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,357
Cherry blossoms, that's nice.
And...

22
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,117
One, two, three, four, five, six.

23
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,873
It's pretty big.

24
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,598
There's a kitchenette down the hall.

25
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:01,800
It's kind of perfect for snacks
or BYO lunch.

26
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,037
Get one of those snazzy Keurigs,
put that in there.

27
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,591
Stick a few potted plants around,
make the place nice.

28
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,592
What do you think?

29
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,074
So no more cell phones?

30
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,830
No, but this is what
the phones were for.

31
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,636
So if you were a lawyer,
this would be a great place, right?

32
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,436
If I was a lawyer...

33
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,390
Nope.

34
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,077
Big glass high-rise.

35
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,233
- Fortieth floor.
- Big glass high-rise?

36
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,074
Yeah, when I'm not on my boat.

37
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,269
All right, Hector...

38
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,440
Is this...?

39
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,110
Is this green?

40
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,760
Is this green?

41
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,800
Excellent, Hector!

42
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,074
Is this person angry?

43
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,232
Is this person happy?

44
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,278
Very good!
That was much faster.

45
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,319
Oh, let's just hold off on lunch
for a few minutes.

46
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,439
- Just set the tray on the side.
- Of course, doctor.

47
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,435
We'll get back to work
in just a second.

48
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,636
Sorry, I'll take care of that.

49
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,717
It's okay, Hector.
Just a muscle spasm.

50
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,313
Good. Let's continue.

51
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,274
Hector.

52
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,194
Are you with me?

53
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,234
Is this Paris?

54
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,557
Anyone in particular
you want me to talk to?

55
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,280
Or not talk to?

56
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,159
Talk to anyone.

57
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,118
Really, just have fun.

58
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,269
Don't worry.
They're gonna love you.

59
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,559
- Yeah, hi. How are you?
- This is Jimmy McGill.

60
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,430
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi. Great to be here.

61
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,000
- Ron, this is Jimmy.
- Hi, Ron.

62
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,073
- Hey, Jimmy.
- Gotta say, I'm obsessed with your tie.

63
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,476
Your husband make it?
I didn't see him.

64
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,200
No? Okay.
Excuse me one second.

65
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,513
Hey, guys. Jimmy, this is Gary and Stef.
They work on Mesa Verde with me.

66
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,673
The famous Gary
and the famous-er Stef.

67
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,309
Kim says you're the absolute best.

68
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,518
- Ken ate a lot of cake with that.
- Oh, here it is.

69
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,433
This is for us.
Debbie, one for you.

70
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,399
- There you go. One for Zack.
- Thank you.

71
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,755
One for Viola.

72
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,718
And you know what?
Two for Lewis...

73
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,634
- Because he skipped lunch to work.
- Really?

74
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:54,510
One, two, three, four, five, six...

75
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,397
seven, eight, nine, ten.

76
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,476
So was Jill there at the retreat?

77
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,478
- No. She came later.
- Oh, okay.

78
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,994
She was a client.

79
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,435
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

80
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,159
Do you guys do theater retreats?

81
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,279
No, absolutely not.
Might be a little different this year.

82
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,477
Not sweating with your coworkers.

83
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,798
I heard Packard-Kilber is taking
their whole company to a resort...

84
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,998
Outside of Santa Fe. It's pretty...
pretty ritzy.

85
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,470
Oh, we're just talking about
company retreats.

86
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,394
That's a great idea.
Where are we going?

87
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,398
Sorry, pal. Employees only.

88
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,233
Oh, darn it.

89
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,638
I'm thinking of splurging this year.

90
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,996
Don't wanna be outdone
by the competition.

91
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,352
You know, word gets out
you're a cheapskate.

92
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,398
Sure, sure.
That's hard to shake off.

93
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,837
I've heard Ten Thousand Waves
is supposed to be amazing.

94
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,633
I love that place.

95
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,599
Or Carlsbad Caverns?

96
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,077
I still think Taos is number one.
I'd love a ski trip.

97
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,517
- I think it'd be good for team-building.
- Taos.

98
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,189
That's nice.

99
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,711
Feel free to jump in.
We're just spitballing here.

100
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,150
I don't... I mean...

101
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:43,037
Well, I mean, if you're up for adventure,
you know where the great skiing is?

102
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,469
Well, it's Telluride.

103
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,237
That's kind of a long drive, isn't it?

104
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,717
That could be part of the fun.

105
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,635
You know, rent one of those
fancy party buses.

106
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,878
Stick Sound of Music on the TV.

107
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,191
Everybody sings.
Pretty soon, you're there.

108
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,477
And I gotta say,
the runs in Telluride...

109
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,200
they make Taos
look like a bunny slope.

110
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,635
Telluride, huh?

111
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,879
- It's worth considering.
- And parkas.

112
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,953
- Everybody's gotta have parkas.
- Of course.

113
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,715
No, I'm talking custom parkas.

114
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,715
Two words, client development.

115
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,475
They see all of you out there
cutting the powder...

116
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,838
in your matching
Schweikart & Cokely parkas...

117
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,593
you'll make an impression.

118
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,956
You will thank me later.

119
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,117
You certainly don't think small.

120
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,720
Shit, you know what? Aspen.
Hey, that's where you wanna go.

121
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,197
Aspen is like Telluride on steroids.

122
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,195
You got shopping,
you got restaurants and spas.

123
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,115
Talk about client development,
it's a billionaire's playground.

124
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,160
- Yeah.
- Jimmy, Aspen is like a nine-hour bus ride.

125
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,199
You're right, you're right.

126
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,990
Nine hours, that... It is a long time
to be sitting on a bus.

127
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,391
- Yes, it is.
- But what's that I hear?

128
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,035
I'm a private-charter jet.

129
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,118
And I'm sorry,
I'm very busy right now.

130
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,114
I'm transporting 56
distinguished attorneys...

131
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:19,753
to their amazing destination.
Aspen, here we come.

132
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,672
Come on, Rich.
You're gonna love it.

133
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,357
Well, that was something.

134
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,240
Yup.

135
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,192
He's making progress
on the stroke scale.

136
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,920
He started at a 30,
that number's steadily coming down.

137
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,390
He's at a 22 right now.

138
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,280
And he's made modest improvement
in his ataxia.

139
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,955
- Which is loss of...
- Loss of body movement.

140
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,600
Yes.

141
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,559
This all sounds quite positive.

142
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:17,353
But you know
the question that I will ask.

143
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,199
Is it him?

144
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,239
Is it the Hector Salamanca you knew?

145
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,720
I think, at this point,
that's almost a philosophical question.

146
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,389
What I can tell you
is that he's more responsive.

147
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:35,110
He's making incremental
improvements almost every day.

148
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,675
I think if you see the evidence,
you'll be very encouraged.

149
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,277
You'll see this was
an especially-productive session.

150
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:05,430
I know it may seem like
a small thing, that same exchange...

151
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,910
would've taken four times as long
a month ago.

152
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,397
And a month before that,
he couldn't respond at all.

153
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:15,037
All his vital signs have improved.

154
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,398
Also, I've been tracking his progress
using the SIS...

155
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,314
with a particular focus
on hand mobility...

156
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,915
since that's his mode
of communication.

157
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,878
Has he done that before?

158
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,875
The cup?

159
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,669
That was likely
an involuntary movement.

160
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,319
Do you think that was purposeful?

161
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,590
You've done magnificent work.

162
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,830
Thank you.

163
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,995
I understand that construction
on your clinic is nearly complete.

164
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,720
I trust the work
is to your specifications.

165
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,955
That's putting it mildly.
The new wing is simply extraordinary.

166
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,919
We'll be able to care for
so many patients...

167
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,640
who would've been tossed aside.

168
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,760
I've kept you
from your work long enough.

169
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,916
It is time to delegate
Mr. Salamanca's care.

170
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,073
His recovery has been remarkable.

171
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,756
And my gratitude to you
is beyond words.

172
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,634
Are you sure?

173
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,719
Hector's progress is very promising.

174
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,191
With sustained intensive care,
he may eventually learn...

175
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,149
how to talk and even walk again.

176
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,038
Perhaps.

177
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,159
We should temper our expectations.

178
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,231
I believe the paila marina is ready.

179
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,272
Now that the boys have built
the concrete forms...

180
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,592
we're nearly ready to pour the walls.

181
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,510
And when's that going to happen?

182
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,071
First, there must be one more blast.

183
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,471
I thought we were done with that.

184
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,994
Almost done, yes.

185
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:44,439
But we must clear that rock
to make way for the elevator shaft.

186
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,920
Just one more.

187
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,830
Carefully shaped
to keep from damaging the work.

188
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,072
How big a pop are we talking about?

189
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,639
Do you know how long
it's going to take to fix that?

190
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,312
Maybe you like living in this hole,
but we want to go home!

191
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,280
Hey, asshole.

192
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,440
You're not the big boss here.

193
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,200
Boys! Cool it!

194
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,673
Yo, Saul. Three.

195
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,758
Coming right up.

196
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,437
There you go.

197
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,594
- See you.
- Yes, you will.

198
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,317
What can I do you for?

199
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,949
This you? Saul Goodman?

200
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,476
That's right, officer.

201
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,640
You wanna know where I got it?

202
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,229
Off a drug dealer
who got sprung today...

203
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,632
because he was using a drop phone
that you sold him.

204
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,479
Doesn't bother you
that you're peddling to lowlifes...

205
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,711
who use these things to sell drugs?

206
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,112
What my customers do with the phones
after they leave my possession...

207
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,237
that's their business.

208
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,391
Let me ask you a favor, all right?

209
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,674
Get your van out of here, park in front of
a grocery store in Corrales.

210
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,071
Some place nice, and sell there.

211
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,715
You know, I'm sure there's a lot
of soccer moms...

212
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,553
that can use some phones.

213
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,749
I don't know. I think my
customer base is right here.

214
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,074
- Get some new customers.
- I don't feel the need to.

215
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,560
See, I got a permit...

216
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,191
and I'm collecting sales tax
and this is a legitimate business.

217
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,431
So anyone who wants
to buy a phone from me...

218
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,637
- is free to do so.
- I'm asking nicely.

219
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,718
And I respectfully decline.

220
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,433
- You're going this way?
- There it is.

221
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,592
What'll it be?
It's gonna be littering...

222
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,753
Rolling through a stop sign?
How about you plant something...

223
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,912
- in my glove compartment?
- Take it easy.

224
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,152
Maybe this is why people need privacy,
why they need my phones.

225
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,040
- Maybe you're the problem.
- As long as you make a buck...

226
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,192
- the world can go in the crapper?
- Yeah.

227
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,795
No, no, no. He's a cop.

228
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,470
He's a cop.

229
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,352
This was all just a mistake.

230
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,234
My friend got confused.
He was just trying to do his job.

231
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,631
I hired him for security.
He was protecting me.

232
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,793
You're in plain clothes,
he had no idea you were an officer.

233
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,713
- He knew all right.
- How?

234
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,837
I picked him up three years ago.

235
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,918
- Really?
- Yeah. Pickpocketing.

236
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,959
Wha...?
Three years, that's a long time.

237
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,039
I mean, how can you be sure
it's the same guy?

238
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,078
- Seriously?
- Officer, look...

239
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,993
you were right, I was wrong.

240
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,675
Were you now?

241
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,234
Yes, and you know what else?

242
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,040
You will not see me here
selling my phones ever again.

243
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,398
Right? So just do me a favor,
let's just shake hands...

244
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,876
avoid the paperwork
and we just go home.

245
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,793
Do you a favor?

246
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,111
I was asking you for a favor.

247
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,279
- Fair enough.
- I asked nicely...

248
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,110
and you told me to go screw myself.

249
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,439
I don't...
I don't think I used those words.

250
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,319
See you around.

251
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,719
Michael.

252
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,391
Glad that you can join me
for my happy hour.

253
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,118
It doesn't look so happy to me.

254
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,670
They feel better after...

255
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,317
how do you say it,
mittagsschläfchen?

256
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,513
When in kindergarten,
the whole class has a nice little rest.

257
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,194
Nap time.

258
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,760
Good.

259
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,037
Now say, mittagsschläfchen.

260
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,118
- Mittag...
- Mittagsschläfchen.

261
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,760
Mittagsschläfchen.

262
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,960
Good. Good, Michael.

263
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,476
- Pilsner or lager?
- Lager.

264
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,799
Naps are for old farts like you.

265
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,878
And his German...

266
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,313
sounds stupid.

267
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,595
He said you sound like a real kraut.

268
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,313
How do you say bullshit?

269
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,556
Bullshit.

270
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,719
Yeah, that.

271
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,878
But really,
you're one of us, Michael.

272
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:38,918
Ehrmantraut in German,
it comes from two words.

273
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,831
World plus strength.

274
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,832
Yeah, I guess.

275
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,912
What's the latest?

276
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,360
Before we can continue...

277
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,434
we must build a new concrete form
and straighten the rebar.

278
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,359
I'm so sorry.

279
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,160
I'm happy to explain the delay
to Mr. Fring.

280
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,473
You don't worry about Mr. Fring.
He just wants to see it done right.

281
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,271
- Let me ask you a question.
- Of course.

282
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,392
What would happen
if we sent Kai back to Germany?

283
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,399
Not good.

284
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,797
Kai is my best demolition man.

285
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,355
Sure, he's a Großmaul...

286
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,156
But he's a good boy. They all are.

287
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,960
Maybe that's the problem, they're boys.

288
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,597
Well, yes.

289
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,197
We need young people to do this work.
Or maybe you and I will do it?

290
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,360
No.

291
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,279
They thought they were going
to be here for eight months...

292
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,593
and they can see
we aren't even halfway done.

293
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,797
You have done
a wonderful job, Michael.

294
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,998
You brought everything
we could ask for.

295
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:58,557
But you can't keep men
locked away forever.

296
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,914
They need fresh air,
a change of scenery.

297
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,560
And...

298
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,313
You understand?

299
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,712
R&R.

300
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,719
Rest and relaxation.

301
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,719
Precisely. This is what they need.

302
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,752
R&R.

303
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,070
Prost, Michael.

304
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,558
Two and a half years.

305
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:41,600
Yeah, they always go for the max.
Come on, now. They'll come down.

306
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,919
PD didn't make it sound promising.

307
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,073
Guy's... He's just a burnout.

308
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,749
He's trying to soften you up
for an easy deal.

309
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,674
All right? There's no way
you'd do that kind of time.

310
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,154
- You're goddamn right.
- You're goddamn right.

311
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,391
Wait, what do you mean?

312
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,789
I'm gonna bounce.

313
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,593
I got places I can go.

314
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,079
No. No, that's not a good idea, Huell.

315
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,880
Better than going in.

316
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,877
Come on, you'll have a warrant on you.

317
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,520
And that shit doesn't go away.

318
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:17,634
You know, three years from now
you're pulled over for a broken taillight...

319
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,917
now you're not just a guy
who shoved a cop.

320
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,198
You're a guy who
shoved a cop and ran.

321
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,109
Well, I just won't drive
with a broken taillight.

322
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,230
Sooner or later
they're gonna catch up with you.

323
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,551
They didn't get D.B. Cooper.

324
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,359
Why don't you...?

325
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,752
Why don't you give me a shot at this?

326
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,189
I think I can fix it.

327
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,078
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

328
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,552
What if I told you
you're not going in?

329
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,876
Like, not at all?

330
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,080
Not never?
Because that's what it's gonna take.

331
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,038
Yeah. Never.

332
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,760
All right? Just don't skip.

333
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,557
How you gonna do that?
You ain't even a lawyer.

334
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,439
A lawyer.

335
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:11,231
Dude, I don't need to be
a lawyer, all right?

336
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,552
I'm a magic man.

337
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,030
Will you have a little faith in me?

338
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,519
See, now,
I would help Huell myself if I could...

339
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,191
but I don't think he'll wait a month
for me to be reinstated.

340
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,636
You've been selling drop phones?

341
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,555
- On the street?
- Kim, I... I just... If we could...

342
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,392
Look, Kim...

343
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,920
here's what I'm thinking.

344
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,754
I did a little recon and
the arresting officer...

345
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,071
he has a DUI, you know,
eight years ago.

346
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:57,159
He's been put on desk duty twice.
I know he has anger issues.

347
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,755
I can attest to it, right?

348
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:04,631
So we get him smelling like a distillery
and we piss him off in court.

349
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,077
Now, he will take the bait.
He'll lose his cool in front of the judge.

350
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,800
A little stumble in there
just for dramatic effect...

351
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,078
and I have some thoughts
on how to engineer that...

352
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,754
but you get the gist.

353
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,515
Next thing you know, case dismissed.

354
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,318
Viola, can you get me case material
for penal code 3422?

355
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,359
Sections 22 to 27.

356
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,035
Yeah, battery on a PO.

357
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,753
Thanks.

358
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,991
Great. What's our first move?

359
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,353
I'm not tearing down a cop.

360
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,880
That's okay.

361
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,394
You tell me.

362
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,432
I will look into this.

363
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,196
Not making any promises,
but if it is as bad as you say it is...

364
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,869
I don't know, maybe there is
something I could do.

365
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,355
Maybe.

366
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,878
Thanks, Kim.

367
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,037
Listen, I really appreciate it.

368
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,639
Okay.

369
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,275
And tell me if there's anything
I can do.

370
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,994
Yup.

371
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,238
Oh, excuse me.

372
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,991
Oh, Viola, can you just...?

373
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,560
Thank you.

374
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,560
I got it.

375
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,640
Hope that wasn't a bribe.

376
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,474
Wow, that would be one sad bribe.

377
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,040
Not on my salary.

378
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,556
Do you have a minute
to discuss a case?

379
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,960
Sure. I got two minutes.

380
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,999
I can't help but think
you guys are reaching with this one.

381
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,152
Where have I heard that before?

382
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,676
- Babineaux.
- Babineaux?

383
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,069
Really?

384
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,232
Doesn't seem like your kind of client.

385
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,914
I disagree.

386
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,595
To start with, the whole thing
was a misunderstanding.

387
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:35,439
Pickpocket with a rap sheet
attacks a cop in broad daylight?

388
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,114
That's a misunderstanding?

389
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,516
I would not call it an attack.

390
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,149
And realistically,
we should be talking misdemeanor.

391
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,152
It's battery on a PO.

392
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,551
- That's 18 months plus a year...
- A bitch time.

393
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,951
I know what you're asking for,
it's excessive.

394
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,116
He has a prior.

395
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,840
- The same officer arrested him...
- Three years ago.

396
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,516
But Babineaux didn't recognize him.
He didn't even know he was a cop.

397
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,149
He drove an unmarked car,
he was in plain clothes...

398
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,516
he had his back turned.

399
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,837
I'm sorry. I don't buy it.

400
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,320
Suzanne.

401
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,358
I did my homework.

402
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,870
You had five cases
where civilians were accused...

403
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,838
of physical force against officers.

404
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,119
Not once were the defendants given
anything close to this kind of jail time.

405
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,471
They weren't repeat offenders.

406
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,433
State v. Murphy.

407
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,557
Murphy was homeless.
He was off his meds...

408
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:30,350
He headbutted a police officer.
He gave him a concussion.

409
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,512
Five months. Suspended.

410
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,512
State v. Karp, five months.

411
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,559
- Suspended. State v. Brezovich.
- You're not seriously compar...

412
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,315
- No jail time, two months' probation.
- No priors.

413
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,996
Brezovich broke a cop's nose.

414
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,152
This is unequal justice.

415
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,233
In this case,
the officer was not injured at all.

416
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,551
He was hit with a bag of sandwiches.

417
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,996
How can you justify giving Babineaux
18 months?

418
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,675
- Plus a year.
- He has no history of violence.

419
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,116
There is no negotiation here, Kim.

420
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,951
And honestly, I don't understand
why you want anything to do with this.

421
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,591
On one side, I've got a decorated
police officer doing his job.

422
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:10,151
On the other, you have a professional
thief who threw him to the ground.

423
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,950
And our only witness
is a scumbag, disbarred lawyer...

424
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:17,238
who peddles drop phones
to criminals.

425
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,511
You don't know the whole story.

426
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,440
I'd rather talk to you in person.
Are you at home?

427
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,795
Okay.

428
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,952
Is there a good place to meet you?

429
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,237
Great.
I can be there within an hour.

430
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,392
All right, Mr. Babineaux.

431
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,518
Sure, Huell.

432
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,434
Just sit tight. I'm on my way.

433
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:57,476
I'm gonna go talk to him right now.
I need you to back my play.

434
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,199
That mean what I think it means?

435
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:03,070
He's gonna call you after I talk to him,
you and I have to be on the same page.

436
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,038
Huell can't run.

437
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,318
He's gonna have to put on
his big-boy pants and go to jail.

438
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,080
- Shit.
- At least for a little while.

439
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,115
There's no way around it?

440
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:17,991
He's not gonna do what they're
pushing for, I promise you that.

441
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,836
But yeah, no matter what,
he's gonna have to do some time.

442
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,797
Well, thanks for trying.

443
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,680
Jimmy, he can't jump bail.

444
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,911
You'll back me up, right?

445
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,840
Good.

446
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:38,274
I mean, if you say this is the only way
we can legitimately do this...

447
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,511
well, it's the only way.

448
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,276
So you're gonna tell him to stay put?

449
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,397
Yeah, sure.

450
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,477
You do your thing, I'll do mine.

451
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,036
Jimmy, come on, what does that mean?

452
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,953
Don't worry.

453
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,590
Jimmy, whatever you're doing, don't.

454
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,000
I know, but listen...

455
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,038
I have a better way.
