1
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:52,817
Gene.

2
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:55,848
- Gene?
- Let's get him on some oxygen.

3
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:03,322
What happened?

4
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:53,538
Light as you can. Take a deep breath.

5
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:56,047
Hold.

6
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:30,405
Mr. Takavic.

7
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:32,176
How you feeling?

8
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:33,785
Good. Yes.

9
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:37,082
It's good news. You're right.
It's not a heart attack.

10
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:40,693
In fact, everything I can
see here looks good.

11
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:44,297
Blood pressure's high, but that's
understandable under the circumstances.

12
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:46,125
The headline is false alarm.

13
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:58,867
Mr. Takavic.

14
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:00,707
Mr. Takavic, sir?

15
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:02,815
I'm so sorry. Would you mind?

16
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:06,646
- I have a taxi coming.
- It'll just take a moment.

17
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:13,549
Could I have another look
at your driver's license?

18
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:41,684
For some reason,
this computer keeps kicking this back.

19
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:46,918
And this is your current address?

20
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:52,661
Can I have your
social security number again?

21
00:03:56,069 --> 00:04:00,165
Five, three, one...

22
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,400
That's the Pacific Northwest, right?

23
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:08,681
- Yeah.
- I got a cousin who moved to Tacoma.

24
00:04:08,944 --> 00:04:11,181
It's supposed to be
beautiful up there.

25
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:13,213
Yeah, it's...

26
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:15,276
beautiful.

27
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:16,922
Oh, I'm sorry.

28
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,557
You got a taxi.

29
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,590
Go ahead. Five, three, one...

30
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:24,626
Oh, oh, eight...

31
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:27,557
seven...

32
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,361
one...

33
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,732
four.

34
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,802
Okay. That's five, three, one,
oh, oh, eight, seven, one, four?

35
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,480
That's really...

36
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,651
odd.

37
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:51,079
I've never seen this before.

38
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,595
Oh, wait.

39
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,561
Oh, my God.

40
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:04,968
I typed the letter O instead of a zero.

41
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:08,768
I can't believe how stupid...

42
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:10,500
I think it's...

43
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,440
Yeah, it's going through now.

44
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:14,642
So it's okay?

45
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,016
I'm so sorry.

46
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,451
- So I can...?
- Have a good night.

47
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:24,283
I'm sorry for keeping you.

48
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,519
Oh, hold on.

49
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,195
Don't forget this.

50
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,809
- Stay warm.
- You too.

51
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:48,347
Cottonwood Mall, please.

52
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:55,743
It's... It's a green light.

53
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:09,050
You know what, I'll just get out here.

54
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:16,458
Excuse me. This is good.
I'll get out here.

55
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:29,374
Great. Thanks.

56
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,074
Hey.

57
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:53,178
I'll trade you.

58
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:08,084
Let it go. If it's important,
they'll leave a message.

59
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:13,491
You've reached Kim Wexler.
Please leave a message.

60
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:17,165
Kim, it's Howard.

61
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:19,328
I'm trying to reach Jimmy.

62
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:21,598
If you would please let him know.

63
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,669
I really need to talk to him.

64
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:27,942
It's Chuck.

65
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:55,868
Everyone, clear.

66
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:13,548
Jimmy, don't.

67
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:57,698
- Thank you, Howard.
- Yes.

68
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,615
So?

69
00:14:17,824 --> 00:14:20,190
He says it started in the living room.

70
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,056
Somehow, one of the lanterns
was knocked over.

71
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:24,787
And then...

72
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:28,827
The inspector says it was over fast.

73
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:32,300
Smoke inhalation, so he didn't suffer.

74
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,306
Yeah, they're gonna say that.

75
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:41,344
Did you see the backyard?

76
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:47,311
His microwave...

77
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:51,719
his stereo, his lights...

78
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:57,262
dishwasher, all the kitchen stuff...

79
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,525
everything electric is back there.

80
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,066
The firemen didn't do that.

81
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,171
He did that.

82
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:16,005
I saw him five days ago.

83
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:18,946
He was listening to jazz.

84
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:22,411
All the lights worked.

85
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:26,888
He was himself.

86
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:30,028
Something must've happened.

87
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:35,294
Something made him relapse.

88
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,702
I think we should go home, Jimmy.

89
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:50,480
Okay?

90
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:54,083
Come on.

91
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:56,050
Let's just go home.

92
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:54,041
- Hey, Carl.
- Hey, Mike.

93
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:57,715
- There you go.
- So this is it, huh?

94
00:16:57,884 --> 00:16:59,442
Yeah.

95
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,547
Looks that way.

96
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,713
You take it easy.

97
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:12,358
So the boss said
he's gonna want the Windbreaker.

98
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,691
Of course he does.

99
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:25,374
Take care, Mike.

100
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:53,064
- Pop-pop.
- Yeah.

101
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,763
Make it go.

102
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:56,704
What's wrong with it?

103
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:58,537
You're standing on it.

104
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:00,542
I don't think so.

105
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:04,342
Look down. You're standing on it.

106
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:06,576
Really?

107
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:11,916
- Hey.
- Hey.

108
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:14,382
You two having fun?

109
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:18,360
- Five more minutes, please?
- Five more minutes, but that's it.

110
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:21,022
- Hey, baby.
- Thank you.

111
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,434
Is that the soaker hose you two made?

112
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:29,974
Yeah. I can pick her up
the rest of the week if you want.

113
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:34,044
- You sure? What about your new job?
- I make my own hours.

114
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:35,908
Really?

115
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:40,248
Must be nice.

116
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:43,885
- Well, since you're offering...
- Good.

117
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:45,956
Thanks, Mike.

118
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:42,137
For the Isotopes capturing the title.
The pitch on the outside, a cold strike.

119
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:45,613
Two and one to the right-hand-batting
McDonald, he doesn't agree.

120
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:48,686
Turns back to the home plate
umpire, Tichenor.

121
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,823
Keith McDonald, last year,
played for Iowa.

122
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:55,620
And there, DeFore was a longtime
member of Memphis.

123
00:19:56,028 --> 00:20:01,056
One for seven in the new campaign.
Right-hand batter with an open stance.

124
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:05,636
Hitting with the lead-off man. Nobody out
in a one-nothing game. The pitch.

125
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:08,399
Swing and a bouncer
through the right side. A base hit.

126
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:13,375
On the way to second is Truby.
He'll stop there. Pageant placed at bat.

127
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:18,245
Chris Truby had to hurdle the baseball
on its way through the infield.

128
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:22,979
Otherwise, perhaps, he might've had
a chance to take the turn at second.

129
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:28,990
Already with back-to-back singles
and another threat in the works.

130
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:30,317
Yes.

131
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:34,722
Las Cruces for Madrigal Intermodal.

132
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:39,933
M-A-D-R-I-G-A-L.

133
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:41,539
Yes.

134
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:46,105
In all six of their games now,
that they have not taken the first...

135
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:47,677
Yeah.

136
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:50,077
And would you have
an address for that?

137
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,023
Jimmy?

138
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,528
It's Howard.

139
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:14,866
I think you should talk to him.

140
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:19,569
Howard.

141
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:22,771
Jimmy, I'm so sorry
to bother you with this.

142
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:27,317
The thing is, we wanted to get Chuck's
obituary in the paper before the service.

143
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:31,388
But I'd really like to run it
by you if that's okay.

144
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:35,824
Yeah, go ahead.

145
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:37,485
Great.

146
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:41,624
Okay. Charles Lindbergh McGill.

147
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:45,895
A towering figure
in the Albuquerque legal community...

148
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:49,131
who built one of the leading
law firms in the southwest...

149
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,903
was taken from this world
tragically and suddenly last week.

150
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,405
Son of Ruth and Willard McGill...

151
00:21:55,581 --> 00:21:58,744
Charles was born and raised
in Cicero, Illinois outside Chicago.

152
00:21:58,918 --> 00:22:02,684
Charles graduated valedictorian from
Francis Xavier High School at 14...

153
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:06,416
making him the youngest graduate
in the history of that school.

154
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:13,925
In his undergraduate years
at the University of Pennsylvania...

155
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:16,533
Charles led the debate team
to national championship...

156
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:19,102
three years running
and won the Larkin Prize.

157
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:22,968
He was editor-in-chief of the Law Review
and won the Moot Court Competition...

158
00:22:23,142 --> 00:22:27,135
at Georgetown Law where he went
on to graduate magna cum laude.

159
00:22:27,313 --> 00:22:29,679
After clerking at
the Delaware Court of Chancery...

160
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:33,114
and the United States Court
of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit...

161
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:36,220
Charles joined
George Hamlin's solo practice...

162
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:39,551
on Central Avenue
in downtown Albuquerque.

163
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:42,626
Over 23 years, the two men
built what became known...

164
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:46,891
as Hamlin Hamlin McGill
into a nationally-recognized firm.

165
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:51,564
Charles made his mark
in many areas of the law.

166
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:54,535
Early in his career,
he excelled in criminal law...

167
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:57,403
winning the precedent
setting case of State...

168
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:01,411
No matter the case,
Charles was known for his precise...

169
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:06,415
clear arguments and his
devotion to the highest ideals of the law.

170
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:11,917
Charles was also active in
the community, championing education...

171
00:23:12,091 --> 00:23:13,183
for the underserved.

172
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:16,760
He was on the boards of New Mexico
charities and a founding member of...

173
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:19,727
Southwestern Coalition for Better
Schools and Native Education Alliance.

174
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:24,165
Charles is survived by his former wife,
concert violinist Rebecca Bois...

175
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:26,827
and his younger brother,
James McGill...

176
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:30,840
who followed in Charles's footsteps
and entered the legal profession.

177
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:37,773
And then there's information about the
memorial service. Date, time and all that.

178
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,578
So that is what I have.

179
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:47,251
- Jimmy?
- It's me, Howard. Sounds good.

180
00:23:47,693 --> 00:23:51,424
- Jimmy's okay with it?
- He likes it, Howard. Go ahead with it.

181
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:52,962
Well...

182
00:23:53,132 --> 00:23:54,724
all right.

183
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:56,898
Thank him for me.

184
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:59,765
And if you need anything...

185
00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:02,369
- let me know.
- Yeah, I will.

186
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:05,108
- See you Sunday.
- Yeah, see you Sunday.

187
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:08,161
Be advised.
We have one adult male...

188
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:11,166
Does he have a history
of cardiac issues?

189
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:12,826
Yeah.

190
00:26:13,005 --> 00:26:15,405
And was he taking any medications?

191
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:16,871
He took these.

192
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:20,876
Thanks. We're headed to Lovelace
if you'd like to follow.

193
00:27:00,886 --> 00:27:01,875
Don Juan.

194
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:50,531
Juan Bolsa wants to see you.

195
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,606
You drive.

196
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:10,511
You I know.

197
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,678
You I don't.

198
00:29:17,723 --> 00:29:19,588
Tuco's man.

199
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,622
He's okay.

200
00:29:23,362 --> 00:29:24,795
Tuco's man?

201
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:26,430
Ignacio.

202
00:29:29,468 --> 00:29:30,901
Don Hector had a stroke.

203
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:32,730
We don't know when he will be back.

204
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:34,060
But listen to me...

205
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,203
Salamanca territory...

206
00:29:37,743 --> 00:29:40,303
stays Salamanca territory.

207
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:42,043
Nothing changes.

208
00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:48,416
Collections continue as before.
The count must be exact.

209
00:29:49,588 --> 00:29:51,055
Anyone crosses a line...

210
00:29:51,223 --> 00:29:52,588
you stop them.

211
00:29:53,392 --> 00:29:55,622
You have a delivery tomorrow night.

212
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,490
You pick up, you package...

213
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:00,295
you distribute.

214
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:02,930
All as you've done before.

215
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:04,924
Do you understand?

216
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:11,970
You do this right...

217
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:16,747
things could go very well for you.

218
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:20,608
Go.

219
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:35,096
The old bastard,
he's always been trouble.

220
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:39,666
But he keeps his house in order.

221
00:30:40,639 --> 00:30:42,334
Gustavo.

222
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:47,336
What do you think?

223
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:51,839
Someone will move
against the Salamancas.

224
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,986
Which brings war.

225
00:30:57,456 --> 00:31:00,448
Which brings chaos.

226
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,550
Which brings...

227
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:05,853
the D.E.A.

228
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:08,283
What's up?

229
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:10,785
It's busted again.

230
00:33:19,431 --> 00:33:21,262
It's just the chain.

231
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,330
Want me to do it
or you wanna try it yourself?

232
00:33:26,872 --> 00:33:28,499
Okay.

233
00:33:29,274 --> 00:33:32,004
This is the last time, so watch.

234
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:34,502
All right.

235
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:38,979
So you take this, give it a little play,
right about there.

236
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:42,215
Loop it around the big gear, yeah?

237
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:43,979
And then...

238
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:47,818
- That's all there is to it.
- Okay.

239
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:53,789
- And?
- Thanks, Dad.

240
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,664
Make sure Mom knows where you are.

241
00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:45,580
Hi, Denise.

242
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:48,452
Yeah, it's Barry.

243
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,521
Listen, could you let Mr. Eglin know
I'm gonna be late this morning?

244
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:55,723
I might miss the staff meeting.

245
00:34:57,562 --> 00:35:01,054
No, no. Car troubles.
Probably just a dead battery.

246
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:04,231
Yeah, I know. I know.

247
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:06,529
Practically brand-new.

248
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,031
Okay, thanks.

249
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:14,605
Bruce had the speed. He could
kick you before you saw him move.

250
00:36:14,773 --> 00:36:18,004
- You ever watched a Liston fight?
- We're talking about what?

251
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:21,873
- Boxing? That's something else.
- No, we're talking a street fight.

252
00:36:22,047 --> 00:36:25,778
- Street fight? Great, so Bruce can kick.
- We're not talking a movie fight.

253
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:29,647
- We're talking about weight, about reach.
- Boxing is a sport.

254
00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:31,721
Martial arts is life and death.

255
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:34,051
Look, I don't care how fast you are.

256
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:37,126
Muhammad Ali hits you,
you're going down, that's a fact.

257
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:39,286
If he hits you.

258
00:36:39,464 --> 00:36:42,558
Bruce Lee, he knows the anatomy.

259
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:44,895
He's got the moves.
He's gonna find an opening.

260
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:47,800
Without power,
the opening doesn't mean squat.

261
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:50,736
- How much does he weigh?
- I don't know. Maybe a buck-thirty.

262
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:55,141
Ali was the heavyweight champ.
He's got a hundred pounds on Lee.

263
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:57,144
Bruce feints for Ali's head.

264
00:36:57,315 --> 00:37:00,978
But he goes low and sweeps him
to the deck. Ali goes down hard.

265
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:02,414
It's all over.

266
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:04,350
Does he have a gun?

267
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:07,923
- I'm sorry?
- Does Bruce Lee have a gun?

268
00:37:08,093 --> 00:37:11,187
If he doesn't,
it's Ali in three minutes or less.

269
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:14,861
See? That's what I'm saying.
That's what I'm say...

270
00:37:15,033 --> 00:37:17,763
Hey, hold on. Wait, wait.

271
00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:23,097
Did you sign Tina's birthday card?

272
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:25,538
- No.
- Would you mind?

273
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:28,679
Not at all.

274
00:37:33,785 --> 00:37:36,219
- You're way out of line on this.
- I'm saying...

275
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:40,016
if Lee tried to sweep Ali's legs,
he'll sidestep.

276
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:42,682
Ali was fast for his size, yes.

277
00:37:42,861 --> 00:37:45,728
But if he gets hit with a low kick,
he won't know what to do.

278
00:37:45,897 --> 00:37:49,628
- I know what he'll do. He'll do just fine.
- You're nuts.

279
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:51,701
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

280
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:54,566
Bruce was a brawler, okay?
He gets in quick...

281
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:15,604
I got it.

282
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,372
Yeah?

283
00:40:18,049 --> 00:40:20,176
Ramirez, team leader.

284
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:21,443
Yes, sir.

285
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:24,053
Ramirez, what do you
think you're up to?

286
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,516
We're just pulling an order.
Something wrong?

287
00:40:27,692 --> 00:40:31,355
May I ask why none of your guys
are wearing a lift belt?

288
00:40:31,696 --> 00:40:33,220
Lift belt?

289
00:40:33,398 --> 00:40:35,525
- We don't usually...
- Stop what you're doing.

290
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:39,363
Go to the equipment room.
You get lift belts and gloves.

291
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:42,870
You use them.
Rules are rules, got me?

292
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:44,372
Sure. Sure. Okay.

293
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:46,373
On the double.

294
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:48,774
Hey, hold up. Shut it down.

295
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:50,710
Shut it down.

296
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:13,893
Excuse me.

297
00:41:14,072 --> 00:41:15,733
I think this belongs to you.

298
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:19,501
Oh, my God.

299
00:41:20,178 --> 00:41:23,011
Thank you. Where did you find it?

300
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:25,481
I need to talk to your manager.

301
00:41:27,085 --> 00:41:29,986
I waltz through security
with someone else's ID.

302
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,145
Nobody gives me a second look.

303
00:41:32,757 --> 00:41:37,319
When the rightful owner shows up,
there's no facility-wide badge check.

304
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:40,521
I find access doors left unlocked
or propped open.

305
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:42,825
Passwords written on Post-it notes.

306
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:47,461
Warehouse workers are using pen
and paper instead of electronic devices...

307
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:49,936
which leaves you open to pilfering.

308
00:41:50,108 --> 00:41:52,599
You got duplicate
routing numbers on cargo.

309
00:41:52,777 --> 00:41:57,441
Surveillance camera blind spots
on the north and the east side of the floor.

310
00:41:57,615 --> 00:42:01,642
Inventory documents going
into the trash instead of being shredded.

311
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:06,381
Not to mention loading equipment
driven at unsafe speeds...

312
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:07,785
- Wait. Wait.
- And crews...

313
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:11,520
- Wait, hold on. Who are you exactly?
- disregarding safe...

314
00:42:11,963 --> 00:42:13,658
Ehrmantraut.

315
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:15,526
Security consultant.

316
00:42:17,068 --> 00:42:20,504
Well, all due respect, I don't know
anything about a security consultant.

317
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:22,662
Well, you wouldn't, would you?

318
00:42:23,241 --> 00:42:25,675
Maybe you'd best call corporate.

319
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:29,707
Try Lydia Rodarte-Quayle.

320
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:50,490
I'm truly sorry, Jimmy.

321
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:53,398
Thank you, Cliff. I appreciate that.

322
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:56,566
Hey.

323
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:58,368
He was a hell of a lawyer.

324
00:42:58,543 --> 00:42:59,703
Yes, he was.

325
00:43:02,547 --> 00:43:04,037
Jimmy.

326
00:43:04,682 --> 00:43:07,549
We're gonna miss him so much.

327
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:09,015
Thank you, Brenda.

328
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:14,752
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- Thanks, Brian.

329
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:20,454
Jimmy, I'm so sorry.

330
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:23,361
Oh, thanks. Appreciate that.

331
00:43:48,593 --> 00:43:50,288
Thank you.

332
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:31,932
I think I owe you the truth about Chuck.

333
00:44:33,204 --> 00:44:34,967
Those lanterns.

334
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:40,136
He was living in that house
without electricity for two years.

335
00:44:40,311 --> 00:44:42,779
He knew how to use those lanterns.

336
00:44:42,947 --> 00:44:47,611
He was careful. I saw it. I know
you did too. There was never a problem.

337
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:51,853
I know it's a terrible thing to...

338
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:57,653
I don't think what happened
was an accident.

339
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:12,504
You probably heard
Chuck was retiring from HHM.

340
00:45:13,311 --> 00:45:15,336
But that's not the truth.

341
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:21,048
The truth is that
we had a disagreement...

342
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,319
and I pushed him out.

343
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:24,843
I made him go.

344
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:28,480
Chuck was sick for years.
And after the bar hearing...

345
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:30,889
The bar hearing
had nothing to do with it.

346
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:33,353
Okay.

347
00:45:33,531 --> 00:45:36,523
The fact is,
he started getting better after that.

348
00:45:37,535 --> 00:45:41,767
He took more of an interest in the firm.
He came to work. We left the lights on.

349
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:46,907
He was improving until the thing with
the insurance, it wasn't the bar hearing.

350
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,944
The insurance?

351
00:45:50,448 --> 00:45:52,916
It was a ridiculous thing.

352
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:56,576
I should've just let it go.

353
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:59,416
I mean, God knows
he's done enough for me.

354
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:01,724
But he kept pushing.

355
00:46:03,227 --> 00:46:05,354
And I got my back up.

356
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:07,898
What about the insurance?

357
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:10,863
It was our malpractice insurance.

358
00:46:11,035 --> 00:46:14,198
They found out about Chuck's condition,
raised our rates.

359
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:18,230
Chuck went ballistic.
He wanted to go to war.

360
00:46:18,409 --> 00:46:20,138
I drew a line.

361
00:46:20,311 --> 00:46:22,279
He wouldn't back down.

362
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:23,640
So I forced him out.

363
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,453
It never occurred to me
that I could hurt him.

364
00:46:33,424 --> 00:46:35,892
He always seemed so strong.

365
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,223
But he wasn't.

366
00:46:39,664 --> 00:46:42,428
I think he did what he did
because of me.

367
00:46:50,241 --> 00:46:53,267
Well, Howard,
I guess that's your cross to bear.

368
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,695
Look at her go.

369
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:19,792
So I'm gonna make coffee.
Anybody want some?
