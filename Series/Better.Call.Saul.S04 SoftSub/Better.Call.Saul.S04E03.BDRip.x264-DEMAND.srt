1
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:21,281
Can I make the call now?

2
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,499
Gotta make it look real.

3
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:46,612
Do it quick, before you pass out.

4
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:26,514
And?

5
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:29,348
What if I told you
you could turn this into four grand?

6
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:30,921
For each of us.

7
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:32,752
Minimum.

8
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:36,828
This little fella,
he's called the Merry Wanderer.

9
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:41,491
He's not much to look at, he's easy to find.
I got this one at a pawnshop for 20 bucks.

10
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:45,229
But he has a cousin
called Bavarian Boy.

11
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,599
Almost identical.

12
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:49,606
Same umbrella, same swagger.

13
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:52,540
That one is worth a boatload.

14
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:56,045
And I gather you know
where to find a Bavarian Boy?

15
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:57,376
I do indeed.

16
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,951
He's gathering dust on a shelf
in an office up on San Mateo.

17
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:04,955
He's been there for God knows how long.
They have no idea what they got.

18
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:09,619
To them, it's not Bavarian Boy,
it's some junk Grandma gave me...

19
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:12,697
I feel too guilty to get rid of.
That's where you come in.

20
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:16,267
This place, they're not exactly
what you call security-conscious.

21
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,427
There's no cameras whatsoever.

22
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:21,540
There's an alarm on the door
that I could probably bridge.

23
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:25,303
And past that, you just pick a lock,
walk over to the shelf...

24
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:29,244
swap this Wanderer for that Boy,
and it's five minutes, max.

25
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,974
Warm up, gentlemen?

26
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:32,709
Yeah, thanks, Fran.

27
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:35,411
- Oh, thanks.
- That's cute.

28
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:37,385
Isn't it, though?

29
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:40,048
Have your food up in a jiff, Mike.

30
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:44,594
Look, they're not
even gonna know it's gone.

31
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:47,494
They look at the shelf, they see
the same dumb tchotchke...

32
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,601
they've been looking at for years.

33
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:53,330
There's no serial number.
These things are practically untraceable.

34
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:56,469
You send Pryce
or some other schlub to Dallas...

35
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,736
Next week, they have
a collectibles expo.

36
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:01,403
Those people are hungry for Hummels.

37
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:04,277
Their eyes are gonna pop
when they see what we brung them.

38
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:08,979
And they will pay through the nose,
which we will split fifty-fifty.

39
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:12,022
So it's perfect, right?

40
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:14,285
We make some nice
Hummel-loving lady happy...

41
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:16,019
and we make a bundle.

42
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:18,664
Let's do something beautiful here.

43
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:23,962
And how did you come across
this valuable wunderkind?

44
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:28,171
- What difference does it make?
- Guys in the office cross you?

45
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,865
Done you wrong?

46
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:31,635
What?

47
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:36,475
You're missing the point.
It's free money.

48
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:40,779
You walk by a 20 on the sidewalk?
No, you pick it up.

49
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,055
- Pass.
- What? Why?

50
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:49,388
It's not for me.

51
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:51,054
Not for you?

52
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:56,360
Is there some problem I'm not seeing,
like, with the swap or something?

53
00:08:56,536 --> 00:09:00,233
The plan's fine as far as it goes.
It's just not for me.

54
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:03,535
And I don't think
it should be for you either.

55
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:08,373
I'm sorry about your brother.

56
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:12,673
Yeah, thanks.
You're really not gonna do this?

57
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,319
Sorry.

58
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,423
- Eggs, easy.
- Thanks, Fran.

59
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,822
- Can I get you anything else?
- No, I'm good.

60
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:25,897
- Sure I can't get you anything?
- No, I'm not hungry. Thanks.

61
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:31,092
All right.

62
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:38,044
If you don't want easy money,
that's your business.

63
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:42,204
I just thought I'd give you first crack
at a golden opportunity.

64
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:45,343
All right. See you around.

65
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,847
You take it easy.

66
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,285
Yes, hello.

67
00:09:56,463 --> 00:10:00,194
I was wondering if Dr. Caldera
had any openings today?

68
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:03,858
As soon as possible.
I have a very sick fish.

69
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,081
Who did this?

70
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:03,545
Don't know.

71
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:06,750
Drove a silver car.

72
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:08,726
Firebird, maybe?

73
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:54,934
Thanks.
And thanks again for the lift.

74
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:58,271
- It's outside your job description, I know.
- It's no problem.

75
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,911
So the acquisitions?

76
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,378
Yes. We'll need to draft contracts
for the target banks.

77
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:06,950
The idea is to have the agreements
ready to go while doing due diligence.

78
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,782
You want me to start cracking
on a draft when we're done?

79
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,821
No, but thank you.

80
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:16,587
- I'll do the first pass, then you can proof it.
- Sure, whatever's best for you.

81
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:21,158
Here's what I'm thinking,
looking at the competition...

82
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:22,767
one opportunity stands out.

83
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:25,301
They don't have
the market share, but...

84
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,962
And this is a big deal.
Walker Ridge is eager.

85
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,233
I agree.

86
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:33,277
They took a hit in the market adjustment.
They're vulnerable and they know it.

87
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:35,846
We should prepare a package
for both with that...

88
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:37,778
Is that Kim Wexler I hear?

89
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,645
Kevin. It's good to see you.

90
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,584
Heard you were here, wanted to say hi.
Look at you.

91
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:45,781
Baby bird with a broken wing.

92
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,620
It's fine. It doesn't even hurt.
Just a pain in the butt.

93
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:51,491
Kevin, this is Viola Goto,
my new paralegal.

94
00:13:51,695 --> 00:13:54,391
- Kevin Wachtell. Welcome to the team.
- Nice to meet you.

95
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:58,000
Listen, Kim, I just wanted to say
how sorry I am about Charles McGill.

96
00:13:58,371 --> 00:14:00,703
It's no secret I had problems
with the man...

97
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:03,034
but no one should go like that.

98
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,871
I just have to ask,
how's James handling it?

99
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:09,611
Oh, he's... he's getting through it.

100
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,546
He and the family appreciated
the arrangement you sent.

101
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:16,018
- Good. Well, glad to hear.
- Kevin, we're meeting the board at noon...

102
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:19,955
- to go over Kim's recommendations, so...
- No, no, no. I won't slow you down.

103
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,787
Oh, one more thing.
And this will just take a second.

104
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,662
Kim, you have got to see the models.

105
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,860
The models?

106
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:37,736
Takes your breath away, doesn't it?

107
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:40,836
Look at this.

108
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:44,881
The whole side of this building is glass.
And it's on a north-facing lot.

109
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,815
I'm told that's energy-efficient,
so I'm excited.

110
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:50,046
This is Salt Lake City?

111
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,714
After Provo, why not?

112
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:57,322
And Cheyenne, Wyoming?

113
00:14:57,497 --> 00:14:58,759
Yep.

114
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:01,263
Over here, North Platte, Nebraska.

115
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,592
Now, these two you already know.

116
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,863
This one's gonna be Ogden, Utah...

117
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:08,199
this one here is Tucumcari.

118
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:11,577
And over here on this side,
you got a few new ones.

119
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,577
Sedona. Pueblo, Colorado.

120
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,682
And you know what?
That's just the tip of the iceberg.

121
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:21,718
After that, I figure, why not Las Vegas?
Nevada, I mean. Reno too.

122
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:23,621
Lubbock, Texas.

123
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:27,089
Amarillo, San Antonio, El Paso.

124
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,785
We're gonna get up
to the Pacific Northwest.

125
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:31,623
Boise. Bend, Oregon.

126
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:34,926
Eugene, Salem,
all the way up to Portland.

127
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:38,602
Now, this one is real special.

128
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,568
Denver. See here?

129
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,970
We're gonna add
more trees on the west side.

130
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:45,576
That'll be great. And then, maybe...

131
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:48,771
a bench or two on the outside.
Kim, is there something wrong?

132
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,643
No. No, no.

133
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:52,614
No, it's just...

134
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:57,788
It's a lot. It's a very fast,
aggressive expansion.

135
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,152
Kevin figures
once we get a foothold in Utah...

136
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,817
- then we'll file for federal charter.
- Yeah.

137
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:05,759
We're really building something here.

138
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:07,991
All your hard work
is making a difference.

139
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:11,261
I mean, Kim, this is what it's all about.

140
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:15,164
So I can get the notes to you
by EOD, if that's okay.

141
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:17,104
Oh, yeah. That's fine.

142
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:20,643
Do you have a sense
when I should expect your draft?

143
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,747
I assume you're dictating it?

144
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:31,856
Actually, you were right before.

145
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:34,322
You take a stab at it,
then I'll take a look.

146
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:38,157
Great. That works. I'll start on that
right after I get you home.

147
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:41,926
Instead of taking me home, drop me off
at the courthouse, would you?

148
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:44,865
I didn't realize you had an appearance.
I would've prepped.

149
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:46,163
No, no. I don't.

150
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:47,829
- You don't?
- Nothing to prep.

151
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,599
Don't worry about it.

152
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:53,768
Yeah.

153
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,804
No.

154
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,884
No. Not quite.

155
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:04,454
I've done business
with him before, yeah.

156
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:06,558
Once. Once.

157
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:08,284
Just the once.

158
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:13,893
Yeah. No. Yeah, I guess.

159
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,125
- I don't know. He didn't say.
- Well?

160
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:17,735
Yeah, he's not into it.

161
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:20,805
He's not into it or you're not into it?
Give me that.

162
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,737
Doesn't work that way.
No direct contact, that's the point.

163
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,571
Just give it to me.

164
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:28,571
Hey, this is the interested party.

165
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:32,240
I have one question for you.
Do you shit gold?

166
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:37,014
It's a simple yes or no.
Do you shit gold?

167
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:38,851
No? All right then.

168
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:42,392
Because unless you currently have
a gold nugget traversing your colon...

169
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,689
this is the easiest money
you'll ever make.

170
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:48,493
How long does it take for you
to pick a Yale three-pin?

171
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,369
Then, in eight minutes,
you're gonna make four grand.

172
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:53,266
Ten minutes if you pick your nose.

173
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:57,375
In, out, no one comes looking for you.
Ever. How does that sound?

174
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,770
Yeah, I know where that is.
Here. Pen.

175
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:07,045
In a half an hour.

176
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:08,584
Yeah.

177
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:14,688
Listen, I'm not trying to tell you
how to do your job, but...

178
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:20,696
- All right, Mr. McGill, you're all set.
- Thank you very much.

179
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:23,926
- See you next time.
- I hope she feels better soon.

180
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:27,262
Excuse me.

181
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:36,941
Can I help you?

182
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,988
Jesus.

183
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:53,326
All right, not here. Let me go
grab my bag and tell my staff.

184
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:55,723
Jesus.

185
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:17,015
Can you not hit
every damn pothole, please?

186
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:40,676
Careful. Careful.

187
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:45,981
Up, up.

188
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:57,887
You, ayuda. Come here. Help.

189
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,916
Well, well. There he is.

190
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:57,917
You woke up.

191
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:00,721
That means
my Spanish is good enough...

192
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:03,191
and Yul Brynner here
is actually O-negative.

193
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:04,860
Okay.

194
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,225
I had to leave a bullet in your shoulder.

195
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:09,526
It might set off metal detectors
from now on.

196
00:21:09,702 --> 00:21:14,036
Gave you a dose
of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

197
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:15,798
Let's see.

198
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:22,778
Pulse is good. Now, sniff test says you
probably didn't perforate your bowel.

199
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,381
Probably.

200
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:27,110
I can't be 100 percent sure
you didn't get nicked.

201
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,949
If this starts to leak, you're gonna
get the worst infection of your life.

202
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:34,650
It's gonna hurt like hell,
and then you're gonna die.

203
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:39,628
So I advise you to go see a doctor
that has some imaging tech...

204
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:43,762
in other words, one that's not
working out of the back of a Jiffy Lube.

205
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:47,396
Until then, keep these clean and dry.

206
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:50,667
Change the bandages daily.

207
00:21:51,944 --> 00:21:53,844
You should be okay.

208
00:21:54,013 --> 00:21:55,310
You understand me?

209
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:00,743
Good.

210
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:07,021
Now, understand this.

211
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:09,593
After I walk out of here...

212
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:12,993
I never wanna see you again.

213
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,325
Never.

214
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:18,937
This cartel shit is too hot for me.

215
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:20,935
You got it?

216
00:25:27,326 --> 00:25:28,452
It's me.

217
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:30,356
Can we talk, please?

218
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:33,498
I just wanna come home.

219
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:36,829
Okay. Thank you.

220
00:25:37,336 --> 00:25:40,305
I just wanted to say...

221
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:42,804
I'm sorry if you feel upset.

222
00:25:42,975 --> 00:25:48,971
It was not my intention
for you to feel upset.

223
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:53,551
My intention was for...

224
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:58,752
Honey, it is top-of-the-line.

225
00:26:02,828 --> 00:26:04,227
Then, what is the point?

226
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:07,661
You're saying I'm a thoughtless...
That I don't care...

227
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:13,772
but it is a very,
very expensive vacuum.

228
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,231
It never loses suction.

229
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,843
What you're saying is,
I gotta sleep in my office...

230
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:22,572
because I got you a gift?

231
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:24,238
Lynette?

232
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:27,241
Lynette?

233
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:31,617
Damn it.

234
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:49,799
Hello.

235
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:52,068
Are you still delivering?

236
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:55,378
Okay.

237
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:03,585
Yeah, just a large cheese.

238
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:06,288
Yes, sliced, please.

239
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,450
Could you also throw in
some dipping sticks?

240
00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:13,326
Two ranch and one marinara.

241
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,816
Hey. How'd it go?

242
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:45,629
Listen. Listen.

243
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:48,698
Look, the office guy. He's here.

244
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:51,529
- What?
- He's dug in for the night, man.

245
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:54,194
Come get me or... Come get me.

246
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:14,183
Now, if you take out the listener's guide
that came with the program...

247
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:17,123
you'll see a chart in there
showing four quadrants...

248
00:28:17,296 --> 00:28:20,493
I call
the time management matrix.

249
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:24,796
The key words to understand
are importance and urgency.

250
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:28,462
Importance basically
comes from within you.

251
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,371
Importance is your value system,
hopefully, based on principles.

252
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:34,538
Importance is your mission.

253
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,204
- Importance versus...
- Your central strategy...

254
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,373
to accomplish
those high-priority goals.

255
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:42,679
- Urgency.
- And the plans to implement that strategy.

256
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:46,346
Urgency comes from the environment.
It presses upon you.

257
00:28:46,525 --> 00:28:51,189
It's proximate. It's right in front of you.
And it's often very popular.

258
00:28:51,363 --> 00:28:53,524
It could be deep and...

259
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:45,412
Son of a bitch.

260
00:30:23,088 --> 00:30:28,151
It's urgent has the appearance
of requiring immediate attention.

261
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:32,024
Now, you have to decide
what is truly important in your life.

262
00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:49,180
Hey. Hey!

263
00:30:49,648 --> 00:30:50,876
Hey!

264
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,940
Hey! Stop!

265
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:54,683
Stop! No, no!

266
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,013
No!

267
00:30:57,823 --> 00:31:00,656
Hey! No! No! Why? Why?
Stop! Stop!

268
00:31:00,826 --> 00:31:03,192
No, stop! Stop!

269
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:17,033
Hey, hey. So did you get it?

270
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:19,643
Shitting gold.

271
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:21,711
Yeah. Yeah, right?

272
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,508
I didn't say it was easy.
Car thing was pretty slick.

273
00:31:24,683 --> 00:31:26,548
Don't know how you pulled that off.

274
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,185
Worked, didn't it?

275
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:30,378
Yeah, guess so.

276
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,018
Yes?

277
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:36,922
The Salamancas were hit.

278
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:39,393
Yesterday, on the way back
from their pickup.

279
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:40,929
Do we know who?

280
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:45,092
Not yet. Varga survived, barely.
But he couldn't see faces.

281
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:48,397
- Someone knows our business.
- Possibly.

282
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,201
It resembled the attack
on Hector's truck months ago.

283
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:53,367
And they knew
the Salamanca men were heavy.

284
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:56,514
Don Juan, we are about
to run another shipment.

285
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:58,444
If you think we're compromised...

286
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:01,518
Run dummy loads.

287
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:05,520
We'll see what we see. No product
crosses until we're certain.

288
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,555
I'll take care of it.

289
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,058
How long before our dealers run dry?

290
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,224
No more than a week.

291
00:32:16,568 --> 00:32:18,593
This is a problem.

292
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:24,137
Find a local supplier on your side
of the border.

293
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:25,867
Cut a deal.

294
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:30,811
Don Juan, with all due respect,
Don Eladio forbids buying from outsiders.

295
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:34,748
- He's been very clear.
- Let me worry about Eladio.

296
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,320
Do it. Now.

297
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:34,278
Mr. Fring. I wasn't expecting you.

298
00:33:34,446 --> 00:33:37,711
- That's not a problem, I hope?
- No, not at all.

299
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:40,151
I was tinkering with something.

300
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:41,842
What's that?

301
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:46,457
Oh, it's technical.
I wouldn't wanna bore you.

302
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:48,149
Oh, you wouldn't.

303
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:53,359
Okay. You know when
you put salt into water, it dissolves?

304
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:56,865
If you stir the water, or heat it,
you can add more salt...

305
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,832
before it falls out of solution.

306
00:33:59,004 --> 00:34:02,132
I'm trying to create a solution
like that...

307
00:34:02,307 --> 00:34:05,902
but with certain benzodiazepine
precursor compounds.

308
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:09,410
- That's fascinating.
- It will be if I can get it to work.

309
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:15,548
Oh, I tested your samples.

310
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:33,200
They range from 39 percent
to 58 percent pure.

311
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:36,772
Except this one,
which hovers around 67.

312
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:40,173
Top of the class, so to speak.

313
00:34:40,345 --> 00:34:43,906
You should tell the chemist
to check his or her cookware.

314
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:47,677
It's introducing contamination,
which would be easy to avoid.

315
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:49,752
Well, thank you very much, Gale.

316
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:52,014
That's very useful information.

317
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:56,223
Well, I should let you
get back to your work.

318
00:34:57,362 --> 00:34:58,954
Mr. Fring.

319
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:05,259
I don't want to cast aspersions,
but I have to tell you...

320
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:08,133
these samples aren't great.

321
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:10,399
In fact, they're...

322
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:13,642
They're... They're not even good.

323
00:35:14,646 --> 00:35:18,241
Basically, they're dreck.
I could do much better.

324
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:20,577
- Gale...
- Much higher-grade.

325
00:35:20,752 --> 00:35:23,721
I could make a kilo or more right here.
No one would know.

326
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:25,947
Wouldn't take more than a few days.

327
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:29,720
I wouldn't want to interfere
with your studies.

328
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:32,086
These are my studies.

329
00:35:32,564 --> 00:35:35,829
Please, it's the least I can do.

330
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:38,461
I wouldn't let you down.

331
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:41,135
I'm certain that you wouldn't.

332
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:44,833
But I'm afraid I can't allow it.
Not yet.

333
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:47,740
You were meant for better things.

334
00:35:48,113 --> 00:35:49,512
I'll see you soon, Gale.

335
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:52,344
Bye, Mr. Fring.

336
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:32,013
I was worried about the wording there.

337
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,454
No. No, it's great.

338
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,957
Really, really solid work.

339
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:40,188
Just make the change
to indicate the correct term...

340
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:43,459
for the disbursement of funds,
then we should be good to go.

341
00:36:44,002 --> 00:36:45,196
Don't mind me.

342
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:48,396
I know it's a law office.

343
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:50,905
Just walking around your law office.

344
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:53,007
You slept late.

345
00:36:53,178 --> 00:36:54,509
Yeah.

346
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:59,878
It took me a while to fall asleep,
actually, but, man, once I did...

347
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,152
You want some coffee, Viola?

348
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,420
Oh, no, thanks. We're just finishing up.

349
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:06,819
Unless there's something else
you need from me?

350
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:08,481
No, I think we're good.

351
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:13,222
Maybe you could also start
looking into federal charter regs.

352
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:15,059
No rush.

353
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,098
Got it. Will do.

354
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:18,599
Bye, Jimmy.

355
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:20,237
See you, Viola.

356
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:21,838
Bye, thanks.

357
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:55,399
What's up?

358
00:37:56,541 --> 00:38:00,739
Jimmy, there's just a couple of things
from talking to Howard...

359
00:38:02,547 --> 00:38:04,742
that maybe we ought to go through.

360
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,242
Oh, yeah.

361
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:08,578
Okay. Let's get it over with.

362
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:11,483
You know, rip the Band-Aid off, right?

363
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:13,123
Yeah.

364
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,953
This is a release.

365
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:19,494
It says, basically,
that you won't contest the will.

366
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:23,498
- If I sign it, I get my share?
- That's about the size of it.

367
00:38:24,169 --> 00:38:27,969
So how much do I get?

368
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,908
Five thousand.

369
00:38:33,912 --> 00:38:35,573
Five K.

370
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:41,612
I can pay off my Mastercard.

371
00:38:48,026 --> 00:38:49,323
What else you got?

372
00:38:52,764 --> 00:38:54,789
This is...

373
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:59,959
It's from Chuck.
Nobody knows for sure what's in it.

374
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,306
You don't have to open it now, but...

375
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:05,135
Let's see what the old boy has to say.

376
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:07,338
Okay. I'll give you a minute alone.

377
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:08,536
No, no, stay.

378
00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:10,271
It's fine.

379
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:14,442
I mean, you wanna hear this, right?

380
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:17,520
Yeah. If it's okay.

381
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:25,955
It's undated.

382
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:27,825
Okay, here it goes.

383
00:39:27,999 --> 00:39:29,830
Dear Jimmy...

384
00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:33,402
I have left many things unsaid
in our relationship through the years.

385
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:37,405
Rather than allow these
unspoken thoughts to die with me...

386
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:39,736
I've chosen to record them
here for you.

387
00:39:39,911 --> 00:39:44,746
I hope you will take my words
in the spirit in which they are intended.

388
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:48,741
New paragraph.

389
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,480
I remember the day
you came home from the hospital.

390
00:39:51,656 --> 00:39:53,749
You can't imagine
the joy on Mom's face.

391
00:39:53,925 --> 00:39:58,760
I can honestly say I never saw her
happier than she was on that day.

392
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:02,991
You brought a shine to her life nothing
else ever did, and I'm glad of that.

393
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:05,601
New paragraph.
We have not always seen eye to eye...

394
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:07,704
I expect that will continue to be so.

395
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:11,899
However, nothing will change the fact
that we are brothers, flesh and blood.

396
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,840
Though we are very different,
I want you to know how much I respect...

397
00:40:15,013 --> 00:40:17,846
what you have made of yourself
in these last few years.

398
00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:20,246
You have taken
the opportunity I gave you...

399
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:23,785
and you have run with it, becoming
a valued member of the HHM family.

400
00:40:23,955 --> 00:40:29,018
For all the problems in your past,
I'm proud we share the name McGill.

401
00:40:30,228 --> 00:40:33,561
I sincerely admire
your energy and resilience.

402
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:36,962
I used to worry about you
finding a place in the world...

403
00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:39,228
but I'm not worried
about that anymore.

404
00:40:39,404 --> 00:40:41,770
I'm certain no matter
what the future may bring...

405
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,135
you'll land on your feet.
I hope when you read this...

406
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:46,573
you remember me not only
as your brother...

407
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:50,805
but as a person who was always in your
corner. And he signed it just Chuck.

408
00:40:50,982 --> 00:40:54,975
Well, say what you want,
the man could write a letter.

409
00:40:58,056 --> 00:41:00,251
- Sorry.
- Hey.

410
00:41:00,425 --> 00:41:04,623
- No, I didn't mean to make it...
- No. It's okay. It's a nice letter.

411
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:07,158
- Hey.
- No, just...

412
00:41:07,732 --> 00:41:11,668
Just... Just give me...
Just give me a minute.

413
00:41:15,106 --> 00:41:16,767
Kim.
