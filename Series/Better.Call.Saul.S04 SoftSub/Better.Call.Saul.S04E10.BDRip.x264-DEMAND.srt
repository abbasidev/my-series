00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,712
My name is Kenneth Kazanjian,
partner with the firm Reeves & Green.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,590
I'm here before you today
to vouch for Daniel Stark.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,798
Your Honors, my name
is Joseph Adamson.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,078
Adamson, Field & Wright.
It's my pleasure to stand before you...

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,715
and vouch for Gina Robles.
Thank you.

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,833
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm Charles McGill.

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,157
Senior partner
at Hamlin Hamlin McGill.

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,475
I stand before you to vouch
for my brother, James Morgan McGill.

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,677
Your Honors, Nathaniel Scott,
solo proprietor...

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,999
and I have the pleasure to stand
and vouch today for Frances Yu.

11
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:41,234
<i>Forever's gonna start tonight</i>

12
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:48,638
<i>Once upon a time I was falling in love,
but now I'm only falling apart</i>

13
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,716
<i>Nothing I can do,
a total eclipse of the heart</i>

14
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,314
That one. Do it.

15
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,838
- This one.
- I'm not doing that. Pick something else.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,311
- Yes, you are singing that.
- I'm not doing Bohemian Rhapsody.

17
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,756
Besides, you're doing your own song
after Ernie.

18
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,872
I'm gonna do one by myself.

19
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,157
- No. This is my night.
- Yeah.

20
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,436
I'm a lawyer now.

21
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,037
All right? I've been barred
for a whole three hours.

22
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,830
- You don't sing that with me, I sue you.
- Okay, well, I'll just sue you right back.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,673
- I double sue you.
- That is not a thing.

24
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,514
Well, it could be, you know,
once my full powers are unleashed.

25
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,353
You wanna risk that?

26
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,112
<i>Every now and then I fall apart,
turn around</i>

27
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,835
- Ernie's really going for it.
- Yes, he is.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,480
Yup.

29
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,920
Chuck's gonna bail.

30
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,310
Well, yeah.
It's not really his kind of place.

31
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,631
Yeah, but, like, the guy
never has any fun.

32
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,191
I was hoping tonight he might,
you know, mingle with the lady folk.

33
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,511
Oh, he will, when he's ready.

34
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,080
- I'm going in.
- Okay, good luck.

35
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,074
Pick a good one.
Not from this decade.

36
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,480
Chuck, hey. Hey.

37
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,558
Hey, you're not leaving already,
are you?

38
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,189
Yeah. Yeah. Jimmy,
it's been great fun, really, it has.

39
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,875
- But I got early meetings.
- Come on, 10 minutes.

40
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,520
- Just 10 more minutes. Ten.
- Jimmy.

41
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,830
- You can do that.
- Jimmy.

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,879
You cannot leave. I'm up next.

43
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,919
Yeah, me. If you leave now,
tomorrow you're gonna go to work...

44
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,231
people will tell you
about my great performance.

45
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,596
You'll never forgive yourself
for missing it.

46
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,114
All right, Jimmy. I'll stay.

47
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,880
- A little longer.
- You won't regret it.

48
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,799
Now, come on, this is me.

49
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,074
Okay.

50
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,518
<i>I don't wanna talk</i>

51
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,111
<i>About things we've gone through</i>

52
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,830
<i>Though it's hurting me</i>

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,754
<i>Now it's history</i>

54
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,513
- Get up here.
- No.

55
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,593
<i>I played all my cards</i>

56
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,594
<i>And that's what you've done too</i>

57
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,434
Chuck McGill, everyone.

58
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,193
Let's hear it.

59
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,033
<i>Nothing more to say</i>

60
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,080
<i>No more ace to play</i>

61
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,232
<i>The winner takes it all</i>

62
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,279
Oh, that's you.

63
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,272
<i>- The loser standing small</i>
- Yes.

64
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,510
- Let's go, let's go.
- No.

65
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,276
<i>Beside the victory</i>

66
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,440
Yeah.

67
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,593
<i>That's her destiny</i>

68
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,795

70
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,513
<i>I figured it made sense</i>

71
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,550
<i>Building me a fence</i>

72
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,710

<i>Their minds as cold as ice</i>

78
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,197
<i>And someone way down here</i>

79
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,794
<i>Loses someone dear</i>

80
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,191
<i>The winner takes it all</i>

81
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,198
Okay. Watch it.
Watch your step, Jimmy.

82
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,834
All the way. That's it.

83
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,514
- That's it.
- McGill and McGill.

84
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,956
- The brothers McGill.
- Yeah. Yeah.

85
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,634
I'm a lawyer.

86
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,519
- Yeah.
- And you're a lawyer.

87
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,512
Two lawyers. How about that?

88
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,433
- How about that?
- M&M.

89
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,638
- Melts in your mouth, not in your hands.
- Yeah.

90
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,553
Hey, you gotta tell Howard...

91
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,280
to add another M to the firm.

92
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,114
Because it'll make it
more symmetrical.

93
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,318
- People love symmetricality.
- Can't argue with that.

94
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,755
Yeah.

95
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,318
Oh, no, no. Come on.
Sit. Yeah.

96
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,920
- Okay.
- That will do.

97
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,992
Okay.

98
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,479
Yeah.

99
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,120
That's why God gave us two eyes.

100
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,630
You know, more pleasant to look at.

101
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,918
Hands and two feet.

102
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,873
Thumbs and nipples.

103
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,595
We could get by with one nipple.

104
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,513
Yeah. Am I right?

105
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,717
You may be more right about this
than anything...

106
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,311
- you've ever spoken about before.
- Thank you, Chuck.

107
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,793
I mean, four or six nipples,
that's interesting...

108
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,880
but I submit to the court,
it's...

109
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,952
It's overkill.

110
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,237
HHMM.

111
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,398
See, that's better.
HHM is just...

112
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,517
- No? Are you writing this down?
- Yeah.

113
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,799
Jimmy, I put a trash can
by the bed, just in case.

114
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,633
- Eventuality.
- You think of everything.

115
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,950
Very smart, Chuck.

116
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,391
- I have some water here for you.
- Thank you.

117
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,113
What do you feel like in the morning,
eggs or pancakes?

118
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,794
Pancakes.

119
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:12,352
- Make those pancakes you make.
- Pancakes it is.

120
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,591
All right, get some rest, Jimmy.

121
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,036
- You've had a big day.
- Yeah.

122
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,874
- A big day.
- Yup.

123
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,560
- Good night, Chuck.
- Good night.

00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,715
He's got a three-and-a-half hour
jump on us...

137
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,510
but he started out on foot,
which gives us a fighting chance.

138
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,469
He doesn't have his passport,
so he's probably not headed to the airport.

139
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,040
Doesn't know his way around town.

140
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,950
But if he gets to a bus or a taxi,
that's not gonna matter much.

141
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,312
Most likely ran off towards the highway.

142
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:05,269
You two head north and south,
see if he's got his thumb out.

143
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,797
You two, go to the train and bus stations,
use the cover story.

144
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,919
You, you stay with the crew.
You keep them on lockdown.

145
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,673
You got it.

146
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,873
Yeah, I need the number
for Travel Wire.

147
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,032
Just connect me.

148
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,635
Hi, I was wondering
if you could help me.

149
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:44,034
I arranged for my wife to wire me money
from Frankfurt, Germany to the U.S.

150
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,520
The problem is,
she didn't tell me which branch.

151
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,634
Margarethe Ziegler.

152
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:58,590
Yeah. Albuquerque branch on Fourth,
I should've known. Yeah.

153
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,399
Thanks.

154
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,879
Watermelon pickles.

155
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,960
Watermelon pickles.

156
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,997
One thousand one,
one thousand two,

157
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,436
one thousand three.

158
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,920
Oh, hi.

159
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,390
It's very nice of you to come.

160
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,359
Of course.
You're Chuck's brother?

161
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,432
That's right. I'm Jimmy.

162
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,711

163
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,599
This is Emily Reed.

164
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,989
Hello.

165
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,632
We knew Chuck back in our time with
the Native People's Education Council.

166
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,235
Oh, yes. I remember.

167
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,074
He spoke of you both quite fondly.

168
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,714
That means a lot.

169
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,199
I feel bad we lost touch for so long.

170
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,353
Well, you're here today, so...

171
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,912
We saw the notice about the law
library dedication this weekend.

172
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,800
And that today was the anniversary of...

173
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,031
I can't believe it's been a year.

174
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,318
It still doesn't make any sense.

175
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,473
Well...

176
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,437
So nice to meet you.

177
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,910
- God bless.
- Bless you.

178
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,197
Very thoughtful.

179
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,320
- Hey. You need some water?
- Hey.

180
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,759
Coffee. And give me one of these
bear claws, please.

181
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,395
You better pace yourself though.
It's gonna be a long day.

182
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,600
Yeah. But hey,
we got customers already.

183
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,400
That's a good sign.

184
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,950
I was afraid no one would show up.

185
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,113
How'd it look?

186
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,034
How'd it feel?

187
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,472
Felt like I looked sad.

188
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,840
- What's the headstone like?
- Oh, Howard picked a big one.

189
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,074
But it's tasteful.

190
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,596
<i>My beautiful baby</i>

191
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,112
<i>My beautiful baby</i>

192
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,037
<i>I feel like a child</i>

193
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,837
<i>With a new toy</i>

194
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,791
<i>Glad and happy</i>

195
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,875
All right, just sign here.

196
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,800
Okay, let me give you...
This is your receipt.

197
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,112
Just make sure your party
has valid ID when they pick up.

198
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,640
- Anything else?
- No.

199
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,871
All right. Have a good day.

200
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,350
- Can I help you?
- Yes.

201
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,591
It'd be wonderful if you could.

202
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,798
I'm looking for Werner Ziegler.

203
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,714
Has he been in here
in the last few hours?

204
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,600
I'm sorry, even if he was here,
it's not company policy...

205
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,480
- to give out customer information.
- Even if he just walked in?

206
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,280
- I don't care about what he did.
- Well, I really can't.

207
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,195
He is my brother-in-law,
we're very worried about him.

208
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,398
He has early-stage dementia,
and on top of that, he's a diabetic.

209
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,159
He doesn't have his medicine.

210
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,631
- My wife is beside herself.
- Oh, no.

211
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,591
Well, we talked long distance
to their sister Margarethe...

212
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,753
back in Germany. She said Werner
called ranting and raving...

213
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,355
wanted her to send money,
and, well...

214
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,796
She said she did.

215
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,960
To this branch.

216
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,037
I have his insulin in a cooler
out in the car...

217
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,955
and I was hoping
I would get here ahead of him.

218
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,000
Look, yeah, he was here.

219
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,551
But you missed him.
He left about an hour ago.

220
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,000
Oh, no. Damn.

221
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,117
Just took the money and left?

222
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,714
Yeah.

223
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,430
Well, not right away. He made
a couple calls on the pay phone.

224
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,000
Picked up his money, then left.

225
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,720
Then what,
he just wandered off on foot?

226
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,678
He got in a car.

227
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,514
I think one of his calls
was for a cab.

228
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,637
You see what company?
Was it a regular taxi...

229
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,553
- A car service?
- I didn't.

230
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,359
I'm sorry.

231
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,996
Any chance that...

232
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,198
I might have a peek
at your security videos?

233
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,555
See who got him?

234
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,199
No.

235
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,430
I get it.
Not company policy. Yeah.

236
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,393
Then...

237
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,032
could you tell me
where the nearest hospital is?

238
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,559
He was here a good half hour or so
before his money order came through.

239
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,669
He asked if his money came,
but not yet.

240
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,679
You mind?

241
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,239
Well, that's bad luck.
You can't see the car.

242
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,153
Yeah.

243
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,360
Thanks for your help.

244
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,910
Sure. Good luck.
Hope you find him.

245
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,391
Can I see it?

246
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,031
For what it's worth, I believe him.

247
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,716
He said he'd be gone four days,
he's not gone to any cops.

248
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,920
This is about him wanting to see his wife,
plain and simple.

249
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,190
She's on a Lufthansa flight.

250
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,393
Landing in Denver
nine hours from now.

251
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,634
Yeah.

252
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,355
And your men will be there.

253
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:24,593
And they'll follow her from the airport
to wherever he's holed up.

254
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,040
And then?

255
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,960
There's another way to play this.

256
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,797
If I can find him
before the wife gets here...

257
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,236
let me bring him in
and finish what he started.

258
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,631
His crew can't do it without him.

259
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:48,431
Ziegler disappears, you are left with
the most expensive hole in the ground...

260
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,831
this side of the Mississippi.

261
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,357
You can find him?

262
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,354
This is on me, I'll fix it.

263
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,760
Yeah.
You get everybody back in.

264
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,555
Get them on the phone to every
cab company and car service...

265
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,279
you make up a story.

266
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:15,957
Find out who picked Ziegler up
at Travel Wire on Fourth.

267
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,873
Start calling hotels.

268
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,633
Here, Colorado, Arizona.

269
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,874
He had to register
under his own name or his wife's.

270
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,676
Pull the transcript
on the last call to his wife.

271
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,079
Read it to me.

272
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,873
What'd they talk about?

273
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,280
No, after that.

274
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,712
After the dog.

275
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,517
They were gonna go on vacation.

276
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,512
Baden-Baden.

277
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,909
Natural springs.

278
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,390
Hey there. Did you find
your brother-in-law? Is he okay?

279
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:18,236
Yes, I'm calling for one of your guests.

280
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,631
Werner Ziegler.

281
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,598
Right.

282
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:27,630
Z-I-E-G-L-E-R.

283
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,439
You're sure? And there's no
reservation under that name?

284
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:39,756
<i>You must be more careful
with the plaza's owner</i>

285
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,951
<i>Because he seems very peaceful</i>

286
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,240
I won't lie, it's been a tough year.

287
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,557
But I'm proud to say
Hamlin Hamlin McGill...

288
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,076
is back and going strong.

289
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,511
It's his lasting legacy.

290
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:04,151
Which is why this
couldn't be more appropriate.

291
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,031
I know this would've meant
the world to him.

292
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,797
A good and proper memorial
for a man who was...

293
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,673
many things.

294
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,678
But always a lawyer first.

295
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,112
On behalf of the whole school,
we wanna thank you.

296
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,239
Me? I...
No, I didn't donate any of this.

297
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,880
I'm just a guest.

298
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,200
- Really?
- I'm pretty sure...

299
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,716
- I heard someone say you paid for it.
- Yeah.

300
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,794
Well, I didn't. I wish I could
take credit for it, but I can't.

301
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,637
The invitation says anonymous donor.

302
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,269
I assumed that meant HHM.

303
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,671
- Baked brie?
- Don't mind if I do.

304
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,992
Actually, I happen to know
Mr. James McGill paid...

305
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,157
for the reading room himself.

306
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,436
Really?

307
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,750
The brother did this?

308
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,196
I saw him write the check.

309
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,319
- Hi, Rich.
- Hey.

310
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,153
This is quite an event.

311
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,835
Looks like half the attorneys
in the southwest are here.

312
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,993
Yeah.
They all came for Chuck.

313
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,677
I heard someone say that Jimmy
paid for all this himself?

314
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,674
He'd...

315
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,354
prefer to remain anonymous.

316
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,033
Well, where is he?
I was hoping to say hello.

317
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,760
He's around here somewhere.

318
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,554
Oh, isn't that him?

319
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,359
Out there.

320
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:27,270
I guess even a year out
an event like this can be tough.

321
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,274
I better go check on him.

322
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,477
- Thanks for coming, Rich.
- Yeah.

323
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,871
Almost time to go back in.

324
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,033
Twenty-three thousand dollars.

325
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:57,720
I can't believe I wrote
a $23,000 check for this.

326
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,439
You know?

327
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,437
I don't even see anyone
from the Bar Association in there.

328
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,796
We still have almost a week.

329
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,954
Someone on the board will hear about this.
And they'll believe it, because...

330
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,520
they heard it from a colleague.

331
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,036
Yeah, I know.
Word gets around, but...

332
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,116
Try this on for size.

333
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,040
Judge Papadoumian
is in her chambers...

334
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,919
she is working late.

335
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,594
Everyone else has gone home.

336
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,792
Suddenly she smells something.

337
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,156
Something burning.

338
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,199
She crosses to her door,
it's warm to the touch.

339
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,875
She opens it. Wall of flames.

340
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,679
Her clerk's chamber's on fire.

341
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,719
She's trapped. But then,
through the fire and smoke...

342
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,634
a figure emerges,
it's Jimmy McGill.

343
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,794
See, I rescue a judge.
Now, that people are gonna talk about.

344
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,113
And it's too big.

345
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,354
And probably... It's not
how I come back from insincere.

346
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,113
Right.

347
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,154
Okay. Wanna go back in,
get your money's worth?

348
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,118
Yeah. I am starving.

349
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,079
Those little hamburgers
are looking good.

350
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:14,269
I'm allowed to pay for the food
but I'm too sad to eat.

351
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:19,632
Z-I-E-G-L-E-R.

352
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,514
He is?

353
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,718
You don't know if he's
on the property at the moment?

354
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,715
No. No, I don't need
to talk to him right now.

355
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,712
No, no message.

356
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,039
No, thank you.
You have a nice day.

357
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,269
Get out of the way.
Go.

358
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,597
Sorry.
It's just not working.

359
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,195
- Excuse me.
- Hello?

360
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,871
I'm at the north gate
and the machine is stuck.

361
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,032
- Which gate?
- The north gate.

362
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,917
All right, if everyone's ready.

363
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,237
Folks, this is Duncan Springer.

364
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,710
He's a senior from Mayfield High School
in Las Cruces.

365
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,718
Duncan, have a seat.

366
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:58,357
Duncan's editor of the school newspaper
and his model U.N. delegation...

367
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,000
represents Kazakhstan.

368
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,279
In fact, Duncan's delegation
was selected to visit the real U.N...

369
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,796
in New York City. Duncan.

370
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,880
- What can you tell us about that?
- Well, it was...

371
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,874
This is Marcie Ramirez.
She's from Moriarty High.

372
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,110
Please.

373
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,915
She's captain of the debate team.

374
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,273
- What's your strategy gonna be, Marcie?
- I think...

375
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,556
This is Franklyn Pickett.

376
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,280
He's from Monzano High.
Please have a seat.

377
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,830
Franklyn is school president.

378
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,236
And he wrote a play.

379
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,677
- What can you tell us about your play?
- It's...

380
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,237
- How did you get interested in Ethiopia?
- Well...

381
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,040
- What's it like working with elders?
- It was...

382
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,669
- Raymond, how'd you manage that?
- I've...

383
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:56,158
All right. Things are becoming
much clearer now.

384
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,634
Can I let them go?

385
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,359
- Have they had lunch?
- Yes.

386
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,352
Unless there's any additional questions?

387
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,639
- Did they all get the...?
- Yes.

388
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,553
Great. Thank them again
before leaving.

389
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,677
- Of course.
- Here's where we are.

390
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,632
Raymond Chen, six votes.

391
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,200
Duncan Springer, six votes.

392
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,510
Marcie Ramirez, five votes.

393
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,476
Franklyn Pickett, Teodora Moon,
Tristan Bulger, three votes each.

394
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,030
And Kristy Esposito, one vote.

395
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,510
Well, looks like we have
three scholarships to give...

396
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,758
and three front-runners,
so unless there's any disagreement...

397
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,479
I think we can...

398
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,914
Jimmy?

399
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,433
Yeah.

400
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:40,433
The one vote for Kristy Esposito,
that was me.

401
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:44,480
And for what it's worth,
I think we should give her another look.

402
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,475
Esposito, that's the shoplifter.

403
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,079
The shoplifter?

404
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,277
Yeah. That's right.

405
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,437
I mean, her grades are good.

406
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,957
Not quite as good as some
of the other kids, but they're good.

407
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,316
And her recommendations are solid.

408
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,472
And yeah, she's had some trouble.

409
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,639
But she was new in town,
she made some bad choices.

410
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,439
That was sophomore year.

411
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,109
She's had two really strong years
since then.

412
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,033
And have you all read this?

413
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,032
Her essay is...

414
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,079
Well, that experience
is what got her interested in the law.

415
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,833
And it's really good.

416
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,480
It's really good.

417
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,397
And my point is that maybe someone
who's been in trouble...

418
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:30,110
someone who doesn't have
a perfect record...

419
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,830
you know, who's made mistakes
and faced the consequences...

420
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,199
maybe she brings something
that the others don't.

421
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,673
I think that deserves
real consideration.

422
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,515
Jimmy, you make
a hell of an argument.

423
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,877
How about we take another vote?

424
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,836
Kristy. Miss Esposito.
Hold up.

425
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,560
Hey. Jimmy McGill, hi.
We met inside.

426
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,669
Oh, hi.

427
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,673
Hi.

428
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,640
You didn't get it.

429
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,590
You were never gonna get it.

430
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,673
They... They dangle these things
in front of you...

431
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,911
they tell you you got a chance...

432
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,679
but I'm sorry, it's a lie.

433
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,559
They had already made up their mind.

434
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,997
They knew what they were gonna do
before you walked in the door.

435
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,992
You made a mistake...

436
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,039
and they are never forgetting it.

437
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,998
As far as they're concerned...

438
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:34,359
your mistake is just... it's who
you are, and it's all you are.

439
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,552
And I'm not just talking about
the scholarship.

440
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,677
I'm talking about everything.

441
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,480
I mean, they'll smile at you,
they'll pat you on the head...

442
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:45,316
but they are never ever
letting you in.

443
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,389
But listen. Listen.

444
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,233
It doesn't matter.

445
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,596
It doesn't.
Because you don't need them.

446
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,956
They're not gonna give it to you,
so what?

447
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,435
You're gonna take it.

448
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,434
You're gonna do whatever it takes,
you hear me?

449
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,319
You are not gonna play by the rules.

450
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,200
You're gonna go your own way,
you're gonna do what they won't do.

451
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,875
You're gonna be smart,
you are gonna cut corners...

452
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,350
and you are gonna win.

453
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,354
They're on the 35th floor.
You're gonna be on the 50th floor.

454
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,716
You're gonna be
looking down on them.

455
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:19,351
The higher you rise,
the more they're gonna hate you. Good.

456
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,916
Good.
You rub their noses in it.

457
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,400
You make them suffer.

458
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,631
Because you don't matter
all that much to them.

459
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,520
So what?

460
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,080
Screw them.

461
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,589
Remember, the winner takes it all.

462
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,475
I've gotta go get my bus.

463
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,919
You understand
what I'm trying to tell you, right?

464
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,239
Yes.

465
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,832
I think I do.

466
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,198
All right.
All right, go get them.

467
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:39,717
Goddamn it. Goddamn it.
Damn it. Damn it.

468
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,480
No.

469
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,679
No.

470
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,596
No.

471
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,719
No. No.

472
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,797
- Can I help you?
- Hey.

473
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,839
My friend was here earlier.

474
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,356
Bald fellow. About so tall.

475
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,198
Yeah. Did they find his
brother-in-law? Is he okay?

476
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,470
No, no.

477
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,757
No, we haven't found him yet.

478
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,274
We're really worried.

479
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,875
- I'm sorry to hear about that.
- Yeah.

480
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:51,512
So I was wondering if there's maybe
something that my friend missed.

481
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,310
I showed him everything I've got.

482
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,391
Show me what you showed him.

483
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,150
Maybe you should just call
your friend.

484
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,039
I did and, you know...

485
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,715
he told me to come back
and take another look.

486
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,234
I'd really appreciate it.

487
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,880
I can't. I'm sorry.

488
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,319
You better just call the police.

489
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,591
Sure. Sure.

490
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,750
Travel Wire, this is Fred.

491
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:27,876
Fourth Street.
Nearest cross street is Lomas.

492
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,033
10 p.m.

493
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,635
Yeah. Okay. Have a great day.

494
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,194
Thank you.

495
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,473
Is there a Mr. Ziegler here?

496
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,520
Mr. Werner Ziegler?

497
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,757
Yes. I am Ziegler.

498
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,559
There's a call for you.

499
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:13,634
Yeah. I will be right there.
Thank you.

500
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,790
Darling! Have you landed?

501
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,838
Is this Werner?

502
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,193
Yes.

503
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,953
Who is this?

504
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,158
I'm calling on
behalf of Gustavo Fring.

505
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,113
Yes, I see.

506
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,677
Is Mr. Fring very upset?

507
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,838
- What do you think?
- Please let him know...

508
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,072
the work will continue.
Did Michael show him my letter?

509
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,630
I explained everything.

510
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:56,678
No. Michael hasn't shared that
with Mr. Fring.

511
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,718
The letter has specific instructions.

512
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:02,477
My men will be able to continue
a few days without me.

513
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,759
- The work will go on. Ask Michael.
- Michael.

514
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,634
Michael's very busy
and he asked me to speak with you.

515
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,110
Do you remember
what your instructions were?

516
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:17,079
Certainly. They are to finish clearing
the debris...

517
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,391
then begin the south wall.

518
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,358
That's the south wall?

519
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,955
The south wall, yes.

520
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:28,158
The concrete is standing by,
they can start pouring.

521
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,357
It's very straightforward.

522
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,438
Kai will know...

523
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:38,877
The concrete... Sorry, I didn't get
that last part. Could you repeat that?

524
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,040
Werner?

525
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,994
Werner?

526
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,673
Mr. Ziegler?

527
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,394
Michael.

528
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,117
Is that you?

529
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,239
- I am so sorry...
- Get dressed.

530
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,880
Michael...

531
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,874
I don't wanna hear
another damn word out of you.

532
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,994
Go.

533
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,153
Hey.

534
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,631
- Hey.
- I think I got something here.

535
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,719
Take a look. The problem
might've been starting with remorse...

536
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,679
so I'm trying to work into it
more gradually.

537
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,719
The law, plans, then remorse...

538
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,111
then brother, then legacy,
what do you think?

539
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,160
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

540
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,834
How'd it go?

541
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,872
We gave three very bright
young people scholarships.

542
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:11,716
Good.
All right, we can work on this.

543
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:16,193
I know it's a lot, but this is one time
you do not wanna wing it.

544
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,840
Yeah.

545
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,034
Jimmy, the hard part's done.

546
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,716
Reading room, scholarship, cemetery.

547
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,673
They've got to have
heard about some of it.

548
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,078
We set up the dominos
and now you just knock them down.

549
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,471
I can say whatever I want.

550
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,674
To the board, I'm still that guy.

551
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,356
Well, you've gotta say something.

552
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,713
What if...?

553
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,718
What if...?

554
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,435
What if Chuck does the talking for me?

555
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,793
Wait here.

556
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,590
- Yes?
- I got him.

557
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,433
Where are you now?

558
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,672
Out by an old raceway off 55.

559
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,190
About eight miles north of San Ysidro.

560
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,714
Where was he?

561
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,157
Placed called Dulce Vega Hot Springs
up in Jemez.

562
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:03,400
It's gotta be where
his wife is headed.

563
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,994
Something else.

564
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,719
Yes?

565
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,839
When I found him, he was on the phone
with an interested party...

566
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,913
pretending to be
one of your guys.

567
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,356
What did he tell them?

568
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,638
Nothing useful.

569
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,836
You're certain?

570
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,759
Yes.

571
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,517
You have any idea who it was?

572
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,992
I do.

573
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:35,239
- All right. I'll bring him in now.
- No.

574
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,914
Keep him there.

575
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,959
Wait.

576
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,799
I'd go another way.

577
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,111
That I know.

578
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,035
Let it be a mistake.

579
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,954
This discussion serves no purpose.

580
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,071
Wait where you are.

581
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,313
I'll take care of it.

582
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,798
Are you sure?

583
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,519
Yes.

584
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,271
Goddamn it.

585
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,239
Get out.

586
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,231
I wanna know what your endgame was.

587
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,869
What did you think
was gonna happen?

588
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,154
I thought I would come back
and my friend Michael...

589
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,073
would be very, very angry.

590
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:00,392
But in time,
he would understand and forgive.

591
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,436
It was never up to me.

592
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,790
Oh, Michael, look...

593
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,713
I know I've made trouble for you.

594
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,679
And I'm very sorry
for the damage I caused.

595
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,957
I will repair what I broke
with my own hands...

596
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:14,954
but please,
Margarethe will land any minute.

597
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,316
Soon she will be at the motel, please.

598
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,711
Take me back there.

599
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,190
Let us be together for a little, huh?

600
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:25,637
Let her see me and know
everything is okay.

601
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,316
Please, Michael.

602
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,995
I go back now,
I go back in the morning...

603
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,470
what difference can it make?

604
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,910
It's not gonna happen.

605
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:43,032
Let me speak to Mr. Fring.
I will explain everything.

606
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,953
I will make him understand.

607
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,952
You're not gonna talk to Fring.

608
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,713
Oh, please. I know. If I...

609
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:54,911
Werner, nothing you can say or do
will make anyone trust you again.

610
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,956
I will go home.

611
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:17,196
I will never breath
a word of this ever.

612
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,193
The money?

613
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:23,753
I'll give all of it back.

614
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,837
I will tell no one, I swear.

615
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,720
It will be as if...

616
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,839
none of this ever happened.

617
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:36,960
Please, Michael.

618
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:42,350
You know I will keep silent.
You know it, please.

619
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,955
Does your wife
have a cell phone with her?

620
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:46,876
Yes.

621
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,551
I need you to call her now.

622
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:53,113
- She landed an hour ago.
- But she knows nothing.

623
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,237
And you need to keep it that way.

624
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,914
She's being followed.

625
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,037
She's followed?

626
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:03,876
She goes back to the airport,
nothing will happen to her.

627
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:08,193
- Surely, they could not... They would not.
- Hey, pull yourself together.

628
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:10,113
Give me the phone, I call her now.

629
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,670
- Give it to me.
- Calm down. Calm down.

630
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,753
She can't suspect.
It doesn't matter what you tell her...

631
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,391
as long as she goes back
where she belongs.

632
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,669
Darling...

633
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,396
Hello. Yeah.

634
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:40,835
You...

635
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,754
Oh, you're renting the car?

636
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,680
Yes, yes...

637
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,792
I have very bad news.

638
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,677
There is a problem at the site.

639
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,672
Yeah. I've been called back.

640
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,157
What? No...

641
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,712
No, not injured.
None, no. I know. I know. No.

642
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,118
Please, please listen to me.

643
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,240
I am...

644
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,477
I'm not at the motel.
I'm not even in New Mexico.

645
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,715
You're going to have to take
the next flight home.

646
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,192
Margarethe, listen to me.

647
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,718
Margarethe, listen to me.

648
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,475
Shut up, now!

649
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,999
You must go back home.

650
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:32,197
No! Out of the question.
This is my work. I must do it.

651
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,793
And I don't want to see you at all,
Margarethe. I don't want to see you.

652
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,951
So go back home!
Immediately. Now!

653
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,038
Will she do it?

654
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,479
She was very angry, but yes.

655
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,711
She will go home.

656
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,039
Michael.

657
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:12,713
If she doesn't hear a word from me,
she will ask questions.

658
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,395
She will go to the police.

659
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,519
There'll be a story.
An accident.

660
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:24,076
Lawyers will visit.
German lawyers.

661
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:28,234
Her questions will be answered.

662
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,598
This you swear?

663
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,917
This I swear.

664
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,197
And my men?

665
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,120
They're going home.

666
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:43,079
They'll be okay. They're trusted.

667
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,432
Is there no other way, truly?

668
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:22,397
There are so many stars
visible in New Mexico.

669
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,959
I will walk out there.

670
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,680
To get a better look.

671
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,318
I mean...

672
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:45,598
it's incredible.

673
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:50,716
I feel like we've been
talking about this forever and now...

674
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,591
here it is.

675
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,640
An architectural feat.

676
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,159
Truly.

677
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,191
Herculean.

678
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:08,477
This is...

679
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,552
This is...

680
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,717
Yeah.

681
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:21,550
I can work with this.

682
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,794
I mean, it's not exactly
what we talked about...

683
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,038
but it has possibilities,
even unfinished.

684
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:33,272
Ventilation, at this point,
is the main hurdle.

685
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,591
But with a series of fans
and the right equipment...

686
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:39,237
I am certain that I could do
a rudimentary cook at the very least.

687
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:42,950
Not until it is ready.

688
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:48,033
Of course.

689
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:51,594
We only wanna do it
if it's done right.

690
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:56,118
I was just exploring possibilities.

691
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:05,313
I am gonna go up and check the...

692
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:08,840
Okay.

693
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,554
Oh, hello.

694
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:05,149
Of course.
That won't be a problem.

695
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,718
Where do you have it?

696
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,998
This should do it.
Chuck wrote a good letter, huh?

697
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,550
Chuck wrote a great letter.

698
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:27,597
It's not just the words though,
you know?

699
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,831
It's how you read them.

700
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:42,235
Jimmy, whatever happens in there...

701
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,074
I'm with you.

702
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:52,840
Mr. McGill, we've reviewed all the facts,
the same facts as the hearing committee.

703
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,391
We've evaluated their findings,
all that's left is for us to hear...

704
00:52:56,560 --> 00:53:00,474
your prepared statement.
So whenever you're ready.

705
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:04,395
Thank you, Your Honor.
I don't have a prepared statement.

706
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:08,554
But I do have this.

707
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,713
It's a letter...

708
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:13,349
from my brother, Charles McGill.

709
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:16,158
He left it to me in his will.

710
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:20,280
And I received it last year
after he passed.

711
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,399
Dear Jimmy...

712
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:32,799
I have left many things unsaid
in our relationship through the years.

713
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,919
Rather than allow these unspoken
thoughts to die with me...

714
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,640
I've chosen
to record them here for you.

715
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:43,511
I hope you will take my words
in the spirit in which they are intended.

716
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,880
I remember quite clearly the day
you came home from the hospital.

717
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:54,959
You can't imagine the joy
on Mom's face.

718
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:59,273
I can honestly say
I never saw her happier.

719
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:16,110
I'm sorry. I can't do this.

720
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:19,915
I was...

721
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,956
I was just gonna try to...

722
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:27,399
I was gonna try to move you all
with my brother's eloquent words.

723
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:31,993
You know, pull on your heartstrings,
but it's not right.

724
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:34,271
This letter's between me and him.

725
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,318
And it should stay that way.

726
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:42,593
Listen, my brother Chuck...

727
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,951
you knew him.

728
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,440
He loved me...

729
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:49,671
in his own way.

730
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:52,480
He loved me as a brother.

731
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:55,712
He did not love me as a lawyer.

732
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:00,114
Big reason I became a lawyer
was Chuck.

733
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:03,557
He was the most brilliant man
I ever knew.

734
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,916
And an incredible lawyer.

735
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:09,312
You know?
And he knew exactly who he was.

736
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,711
Exactly.

737
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:16,075
And all my life,
I wanted to make him proud.

738
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:20,759
And he was not an easy man
to make proud.

739
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,680
You know, like...

740
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,395
climbing Everest without supplies.

741
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:28,280
If you were one of the lucky few
who reached that peak...

742
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:31,399
even for a moment,
if you made him proud...

743
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:34,837
wow, what a feeling.

744
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,710
And he let you know it too.

745
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:41,034
But if you weren't one of those people...

746
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:46,832
He was polite enough, but he did not
suffer fools, you know?

747
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,753
And he could be judgmental.

748
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,953
And difficult.

749
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:53,356
He knew how to get under your skin.

750
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:58,111
Could be a real son of a bitch.

751
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:02,232
Chuck was the one
who was always right.

752
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,232
Always.

753
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,878
And usually, he was.

754
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:11,037
You know, so for a guy like me...

755
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,874
I did lousy in school,
I lacked ambition...

756
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,600
I always cut corners.
I mean, for me...

757
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:21,800
to live up to the standards
of Charles McGill...

758
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,912
I mean, look at me.

759
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,517
I'll never be as moral as him...

760
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,353
I'll never be as smart...

761
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,159
I'll never be as respected.

762
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:41,235
I'll never be as good as Chuck.

763
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:47,276
But I can try.

764
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,272
I can try.

765
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,957
If you decide...

766
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:54,795
and I get to be a lawyer...

767
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:01,991
I'll do everything in my power
to be worthy of the name McGill.

768
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:07,673
And if you decide I'm not a lawyer...

769
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:12,878
doesn't matter.

770
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:18,311
I'll still try to be
the best man that I can be.

771
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,992
I'm lucky...

772
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,516
I got this letter.

773
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:29,320
I never had a chance
to write him a letter...

774
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:32,632
and to tell him all the things
that I should've.

775
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,359
But I gotta believe
that somehow...

776
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,790
Somehow, he knows.

777
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:47,513
Well, that's...

778
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:50,669
That'll have to do it for me.

779
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,719
Sorry.

780
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:55,233
Thank you.

781
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,435
- I knew you could do it.
- That was so great.

782
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,398
Yes. They...
They have to reinstate you.

783
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:11,677
- Yeah. Did you see those suckers?
- They have to.

784
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:14,475
That one asshole was crying.
He had actual tears.

785
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:15,869
Jesus, Kim.

786
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:19,875
Listen, I started reading the letter
and I just knew it wasn't...

787
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:22,316
I could tell by their faces
it wasn't gonna be enough.

788
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:26,076
So I just went off on this flow,
you know?

789
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:29,517
I had this energy going through me,
it was like improv or jazz...

790
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,512
and then boom,
I sunk the hook in.

791
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:35,120
I'm so lucky I have this letter.

792
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:38,040
God, I could see
The Matrix, you know?

793
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:40,880
I was invincible.
I could dodge bullets, baby.

794
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:43,953
And you were right. You were right.
It was all about Chuck.

795
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,310
The whole time.

796
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,392
Oh, Mr. McGill, you're still here.

797
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:50,234
- There's some good news.
- Believe me. I already know.

798
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,471
Good. If you want to
come with me to the office...

799
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:56,190
- there's paperwork for you to sign.
- Absolutely. Let's do this thing.

800
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:59,432
Oh, and, sweetheart,
I'm gonna need one more form.

801
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:04,396
A DBA. Because I'm not gonna be
practicing under the name McGill, so...

802
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:07,115
Shouldn't be a problem.
Down the hall, we have all the forms.

803
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,350
Great, great.

804
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:10,040
Wait. Wait, Jimmy, what?

805
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,917
It's all good, man.
