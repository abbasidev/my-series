1
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,153
Excuse me.

2
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,478
- May I help you?
- Oh, I really hope so.

3
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,472
What can I do for you?

4
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,838
My firm submitted plans
for Mesa Verde Bank...

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,354
we're building a branch here.

6
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,989
Sure, I think I saw that come through.

7
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,551
As I was cleaning up,
refiling all our plans internally...

8
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,838
I realized I was missing
one of the old versions.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,595
We had some late changes
to the conference room dimensions...

10
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,558
so different versions floated around.

11
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,951
Things got complicated, sorry.

12
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,835
So long story short,
I think it's possible the wrong version...

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,559
ended up in our proposal.

14
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,313
- Oh, dear.
- Yeah.

15
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,757
So I have the correct plans here...

16
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,709
and I was hoping to just take a look
at the approved plans to compare them?

17
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,479
- Just to make sure.
- Okay.

18
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,154
But if they're wrong, you have to...

19
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,437
Refile. Yeah, I know.

20
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,592
I just wanna make sure
they're the wrong ones...

21
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,474
before I get into it with my bosses.

22
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,830
No problem.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,639
- Mesa Verde?
- Yes.

24
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,316
- Do you have the address?
- 8783 Baylor Street.

25
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,955
- I'll be right back.
- Thank you.

26
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,031
Here we go.

27
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,276
- Oh, I'll come around to you.
- Oh, good, thanks.

28
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,593
Okay.

29
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,279
Yup. Dates match.
That's a good start.

30
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,916
All right, conference room is
on sheet A 1.1.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,315
And room dimensions should
be 15-foot-6 by 12-foot-6.

32
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,115
15-foot-6 by 12-foot-6.

33
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,436
Great.

34
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,557
Break or sprain?

35
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,634
Your foot.

36
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,554
A sprain. I started trail running
a couple months ago.

37
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,235
Went for a run last week,
wasn't paying attention...

38
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,758
got my foot snagged in one of the roots.
Just twisted my ankle.

39
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,510
Do you have a setback
for that conference room wall...

40
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,354
at 2 feet, 10 inches?

41
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,160
Yes, the wall is set back
2 feet, 10 inches.

42
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,549
So far so good.

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,596
It hasn't been that bad
except I have an 8-month-old, so...

44
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,194
Oh, congratulations.

45
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,589
Thanks.

46
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,753
Been, you know,
kind of doing it on my own.

47
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,276
My brother's been helping
since I'm a little limited.

48
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,076
- Driving me around and whatnot.
- It's nice to have family around.

49
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,079
Yeah, for the most part.

50
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,596
He tries.
That's the important thing, right?

51
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,160
- Yeah.
- Okay.

52
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,516
I think these are the same.

53
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,831
Am I missing anything?

54
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,591
- They look the same to me.
- Great.

55
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,951
- Yes!
- No refiling.

56
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,352
Thank you. Thank you, Shirley. God.

57
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,671
- You're welcome.
- You saved my life.

58
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,992
I am telling you,
my bosses would've murdered me.

59
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,594
I understand.

60
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,877
You're the only person in charge
of organization...

61
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,077
and suddenly
everything's your fault, right?

62
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,994
I assume you would know
all about that.

63
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,910
Yo, Lizzie.

64
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,480
Bill?

65
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,439
Where's Aidan?

66
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,239
Hey, lady.

67
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,393
He's fine. But he's very hungry.

68
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,995
- And he's like a little eating machine.
- Bill. Bill.

69
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,595
- Can you sniff this for me?
- Bill. Where is Aidan?

70
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,319
He's fine. He's in the Wrangler.

71
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,073
- Take a smell...
- What?

72
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,438
- Because it's a little funky.
- You left my child in your Jeep?

73
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,353
Yeah, I cracked the window.

74
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,670
- Bill.
- Just... What?

75
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,991
- Check this.
- Give me the keys. I'm not gonna check.

76
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,753
- Where are you going?
- To get Aidan.

77
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,231
You can't leave a baby in a car.
What the hell is wrong with you?

78
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,319
Oh, man.

79
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,391
- Go get the baby, Bill.
- What? What did I do?

80
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,313
- Help her.
- It's only been a minute.

81
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,392
I didn't know.

82
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,040
Sorry.

83
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,759
What am I supposed to do?

84
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,834
You're supposed to watch a baby
for five minutes. How hard is that?

85
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,874
Slow down, I'm wearing flip-flops.

86
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,271
- How's Aidan?
- Oh, he's fine.

87
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,512
He was only alone for a minute,
thank God. Wait.

88
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,995
What happened?

89
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,073
- Your milk. It kind of went everywhere.
- What?

90
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,438
- What are you talk...?
- I am so sorry.

91
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,957
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

92
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,157
- I... I...
- No, no, no!

93
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,432
- Shirley, I can't show this to them.
- All right, all right.

94
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,195
This is what we're gonna do.
This is what we're gonna do.

95
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,592
You're gonna give me your copy...

96
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,877
and I'll trade them out.

97
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,954
Won't you get in trouble?

98
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,510
They're exactly the same.
No one has to know.

99
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,000
Are you sure?

100
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,117
- Are you sure?
- Go on.

101
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,556
- Okay. Okay.
- Get them.

102
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,236
Okay. If you're sure.

103
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,834
Okay.

104
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,438
Thank you so much.

105
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,873
Shirley...

106
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,034
I can't tell you
how much this means to me, really.

107
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,955
- You're a lifesaver.
- We need to stick together.

108
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,033
Being a mom is hard enough.

109
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,718
All right.

110
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,760
All right.

111
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,310
Let's make this official.

112
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,711
We have returned, welcome back
to The Newlywed Game.

113
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,679
Gentlemen, we've recorded
your predictions on cards on your laps.

114
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,560
Remember, each time your prediction
matches your wife's answer...

115
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,792
you get five points. The one couple
with the most points at the end...

116
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,674
wins a great second honeymoon.
So, ladies, we are thrilled...

117
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,116
you came back.
Your first question for five points.

118
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,196
Tell me, ladies, if you were a boat,
does your husband think you've been...

119
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,990
taking the most water lately,
on your stern...

120
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,994
on your port side,
your starboard side...

121
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,560
or on your bow?

122
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,598
- Where you taking in that water?
- My stern.

123
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,035
Oh, God.

124
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,080
He said you've been taking
a lot of water in on your bow.

125
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,960
- Bow?
- Top half's the bow?

126
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,032
- Yeah, but...
- Okay.

127
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,798
- Are you complaining?
- No, not at all.

128
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,713
You don't like her bow?

129
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,200
Uncle Hector...

130
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,556
It's Lalo.

131
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,234
You know me, don't you?

132
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,916
One means yes?

133
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,590
Nothing means no.

134
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:45,957
Who's got the biggest set of balls
north, south, east or west of Michoacan?

135
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,279
Yes, indeed!

136
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,591
I knew you were still in there.

137
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,395
Uncle Hector.

138
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,072
You know what I was thinking about
this morning?

139
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:11,078
The smell of burning leather
and horsehair stuffing.

140
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,313
Do you remember?

141
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,275
Hotel Tulipan.

142
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,152
You were so polite to that guy.

143
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,319
And he turns his back on you?

144
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:34,671
Makes that big deal
to show he's not scared.

145
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,399
He was a professor
before he opened that place, remember?

146
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,917
He'd always bring that up.
The big college professor.

147
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,038
You took your time with him.

148
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,232
And his wife listening from the side.

149
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,632
That asshole was so proud
of his beautiful Spanish...

150
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,914
his books, his antiques.

151
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,559
But when it burned...

152
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,599
it all smelled like shit.

153
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,671
I never told you this, but...

154
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,798
I went back inside.

155
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,790
I went through the flames, the smoke.

156
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:39,315
It was so hot,
the rubber on my shoes melted a little.

157
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,113
Yes, I know it was very stupid, but...

158
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,878
I'm sentimental.

159
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,079
I wanted a souvenir.

160
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,990
I kept it all these years.

161
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,920
I brought it.

162
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,199
Do you want to see it?

163
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,556
Brings back memories, yes?

164
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,155
Remember that guy hitting this,
calling for his bellboy?

165
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:34,714
And you? Teaching the teacher!

166
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,280
There you go, Uncle.

167
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,390
Perfect.

168
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,040
Give it a try.

169
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,195
Again, Uncle.

170
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,156
That's it!

171
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,676
Again!

172
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,435
That's a Salamanca!

173
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,756
Hey, why don't you go get some Jell-O.

174
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,195
Uncle, let's talk about the Chilean.

175
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:18,275
Same old Hector.
Just wants to kill everybody.

176
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,391
The biggest pancake
is not the best pancake.

177
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,156
Or they would call it the best pancake
that happens to be the biggest.

178
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,391
- Top off?
- But, no, it's the...

179
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,160
- Thank you.
- Can I get y'all anything else?

180
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,959
- No.
- We're good, thanks.

181
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,113
- You don't want a whole other burger?
- Whenever you're ready. No rush.

182
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,317
Okay, thanks.

183
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,871
You better take it easy with that stuff.

184
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,280
We still got at least
an hour on the road.

185
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,476
Gotta stay awake.

186
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:51,031
Yeah, but you gotta be able to sleep
when we get home too.

187
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,431
- What time's your hearing?
- Eleven.

188
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,435
This time next week, I will once again
be James McGill, Esquire.

189
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,671
Yes.

190
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,797
And I already got a jump
on my new practice.

191
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,997
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

192
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,595
Unexpected bonus
of the drop-phone business.

193
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,797
It turns out,
it's great for client development.

194
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,192
Yes, I guess that's true.

195
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,955
Sooner or later,
every last one of those idiots...

196
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,396
is gonna need an attorney.

197
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,311
Of course, they all know me
as Saul Goodman.

198
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,392
That's just details.

199
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,350
Gotta say, a lot of people
are gonna be begging...

200
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,398
for the old Huell Babineaux treatment.

201
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,755
What's that?

202
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,835
Our powers combined.

203
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:47,556
People would pay top dollar for us to
undo a potentially life-ruining sentence.

204
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,632
I think we should only use
our powers for good.

205
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,589
What are we considering good
as of 9:06 p.m. tonight?

206
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,911
You know what?
It's like Potter Stewart said...

207
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,072
we'll know it when we see it.

208
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,633
We just drove 300 miles
to scam Lubbock, Texas...

209
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,998
so that your client can have
a 13-percent-bigger bank branch.

210
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,232
Don't get me wrong,
I loved every second of it...

211
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,393
but how is that using our powers
for good?

212
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,317
Okay, fine.

213
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,197
Yeah, we'll know it when we see it.
I like it.

214
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,238
It's a plan I can get behind.

215
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,716
Okay.

216
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,755
I'm in position.

217
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,153
We're almost ready here.
Stand by.

218
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,233
Copy.

219
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,233
What's up?

220
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,916
My apologies.
We have a small problem.

221
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,116
How small?

222
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,509
A red light.

223
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,076
It means there's no...

224
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,995
How do you say...?
Continuity in the circuit...

225
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,992
of one of the three charges.

226
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,560
The orange one.

227
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,474
There may be a loose or faulty wire.

228
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,356
I'll go in and check.

229
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,513
I thought you were the demolition expert.

230
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,876
It's my job, Michael.

231
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,276
Stand by.

232
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,920
Copy. Standing by.

233
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,720
Pull yourself together.

234
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,551
Pull yourself together, you idiot.

235
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,309
Try it now.

236
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,675
I think we're ready here, Michael.

237
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,480
All green.

238
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,432
We're good here.

239
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,636
Ready.

240
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,837
Go. Call it.

241
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,434
On the go.

242
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,879
Five...

243
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,594
four...

244
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,479
three...

245
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,279
two...

246
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,920
one.

247
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,196
Now!

248
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,316
That's how it's done.

249
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,312
Oh, wait. We're missing one.

250
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,597
We're missing one.

251
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,914
No, no, no, I'm good.

252
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,958
- Thank you.
- No, we don't accept this.

253
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,680
You can't be always on duty, Mike.

254
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:50,511
Mike, Mike, Mike.

255
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,080
Good job.

256
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,477
What's on your mind?

257
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,551
Nothing really.

258
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,314
I'm pleased the blasting went well.

259
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,680
No damage to the structure,
no unforeseen incidents.

260
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,272
You don't seem pleased.

261
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,437
I'm just tired.

262
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,831
I need to know what's going on.

263
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,515
Nothing is going on.

264
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,994
This work is taking longer
than I estimated.

265
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,840
- It is.
- And I appreciate the R&R.

266
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,238
The boys, they had fun.

267
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,239
But I'm...

268
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,839
Michael...

269
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,754
you were married?

270
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,789
- I was.
- How long?

271
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,640
Twenty-two years.

272
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,234
Perhaps you will understand.

273
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,959
Twenty-six in April.

274
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,157
Congratulations.

275
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,238
My wife.

276
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,993
I'm...

277
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,836
I'm...

278
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,469
Without her, I'm ad...

279
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,757
- Adrift.
- You're adrift without her.

280
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,357
- You've been away before.
- Yes, of course. Not like this.

281
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,115
I finish what I've started,
no question of that.

282
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:51,875
Still, I can't help but wonder...

283
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,994
No, of course not.

284
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,117
- What?
- It's impossible.

285
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,837
Although...

286
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:07,593
Kai could supervise work
until I get back.

287
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,480
I don't wish to cause you hardship.

288
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,554
Even though I'd only be gone
for four days.

289
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,474
Five, maybe. Total.

290
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,439
You're talking about flying
to Germany for a weekend?

291
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,273
Just a quick trip.

292
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:29,040
I could leave detailed instructions.

293
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,476
The work would not be interrupted.

294
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,034
You want to see your wife?

295
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,512
More than anything.

296
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,554
Then finish the job.

297
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,996
Werner, you can do this.

298
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,437
You put your head down
and you push your way through.

299
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,832
When it's done,
from the money you've made here...

300
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,799
you'll never be away
from your wife again.

301
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,713
Of course.

302
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,473
Of course, you're right.

303
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,836
A flight of fancy.

304
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,276
All right. I tell you what.

305
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,390
We'll get you on the phone with her
for an extra call.

306
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,191
We'll do it tomorrow.

307
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,837
Thank you, my friend.

308
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,357
You hang in there.

309
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,240
Mr. Fring.

310
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,073
Yes, Lyle?

311
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,557
There's a man who just came in.

312
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,192
And I know it's been a while,
but I was just, like, he is so familiar.

313
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,149
I think it's one of the guys
that made all the trouble last year.

314
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,872
Not the main guy,
which is why I'm not totally sure.

315
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,955
I see.

316
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,520
He's not doing anything.

317
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,430
He and the other guy ordered some food,
and they're just sitting.

318
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,919
- But I thought you'd wanna know.
- Thank you, Lyle. I'll take care of it.

319
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,079
Is everything to your liking?

320
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,959
Are you kidding me?

321
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:35,955
This is the best chicken
I have ever had.

322
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,430
Well, I am delighted to hear that.

323
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,193
No, really, I'm serious. I mean...

324
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,751
it's crispy, but it's not dried out.

325
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:48,278
And the seasoning, it's so flavorful.

326
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,114
Well, thank you.
Is there anything else I can do for you?

327
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,359
Is there any chance...?

328
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,672
And I know the answer is probably no.

329
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,911
But is it possible for me
to meet the owner?

330
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,719
I'm the owner.

331
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,234
Really?

332
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,835
How lucky for me.

333
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,913
Would you be interested in franchising?

334
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,680
Because I would be eager to invest.

335
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,197
Well, perhaps we should go to my office,
where we can discuss it further.

336
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,158
Excellent.

337
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,960
- Don't waste that.
- This way.

338
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,117
Now, what may I do for you, Señor...?

339
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,560
Salamanca. Eduardo Salamanca.
But you can call me Lalo.

340
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,712
And you're Gustavo Fring.

341
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:36,079
I've been an admirer
of yours for many years.

342
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,914
You have how many restaurants?

343
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,436
- Seven.
- Seven.

344
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,752
And starting from nothing.
That's incredible.

345
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,238
What may I do for you?

346
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,753
I come here on behalf
of my entire family...

347
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,992
- to give you our deepest thanks.
- Well, for what?

348
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,514
For what?

349
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,672
For saving Don Hector's life.

350
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,360
I just visited him.

351
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:02,150
You know, seeing a man like that,
can't speak, can barely move...

352
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,517
I wanted to weep.

353
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,879
But it could have been worse.

354
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:10,158
Varga tells me that while everyone else
was picking their asses...

355
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,119
you rushed to him, struck him
on the chest and brought him back.

356
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,351
It was a simple instinct.

357
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,997
But still, with all the history
between you two...

358
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,994
What you did was a gesture of peace.

359
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,072
At least, that's how we see it.

360
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,033
I'm very pleased to hear that.

361
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,391
And here we are getting along.

362
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:39,197
You ever think, maybe Don Eladio
is one shrewd bastard?

363
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,718
Maybe he likes the bad blood
between us?

364
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:50,116
He sits by his pool, baking in the sun,
giving orders.

365
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:56,999
But your trucks move the product.
And Salamanca muscle keeps everyone in line.

366
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,280
I don't consider that there's bad blood.

367
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,154
Really?

368
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:07,111
Still, if we were to get along too well...

369
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,516
I'm sure Eladio wouldn't like that,
would he?

370
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,796
I am satisfied
with the current arrangement.

371
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,192
I'm just shitting you.

372
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,751
You would be crazy
to go up against Eladio.

373
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,800
Look, I'm gonna be in town for a while.

374
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,475
So, you know, we'll talk some more.

375
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,115
We owe you.

376
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,351
If you need a favor...

377
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,672
- I'm your man.
- Same. Naturally.

378
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,912
Oh, and I'll be back for that chicken.

379
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,276
It's too tasty to stay away from.

380
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,957
You say you pick up six keys a week?

381
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,634
Yeah.

382
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:17,118
- Where?
- He's got a chicken farm way out of town.

383
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,156
Show me.

384
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,358
Mr. McGill?
We're ready for you now.

385
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,954
Great.

386
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,999
And it looks like you've completed
the Pre-Prosecution Diversion Program?

387
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,157
That's right.
Three and a half weeks ago.

388
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,551
I believe if you look
at the supplemental materials...

389
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:21,191
there's a letter from my supervisor,
Brad Markham.

390
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,399
Good.

391
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,434
He says he was impressed
with your commitment.

392
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,593
And for most of last year
you've been employed at CC Mobile?

393
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,916
It's a cell phone store.

394
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,551
And, again, there's a letter
from my manager, Mr. Robert Finn.

395
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,197
It's also in the supplemental materials.

396
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,757
Says here you were part of something
called the Silver Circle?

397
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,799
- Three months in a row?
- It's a sales award.

398
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,998
Mr. Finn and the people at CC Mobile
have been very generous.

399
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:53,597
You don't have to sell many phones
to get in the Silver, believe me.

400
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,195
What made you choose
that particular field?

401
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,239
Honestly?
Just to put bread on the table.

402
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:03,952
But I would say it's given me
a new outlook on client relations.

403
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:08,672
After dealing with cell phone contracts,
explaining statutes to my clients...

404
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,997
should be a cakewalk.

405
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,912
As the saying goes,
the law is constantly changing.

406
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,676
Have you been keeping yourself
apprised of the latest developments?

407
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,911
I've been reading the Bar Journal.

408
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:24,278
What caught my eye recently
was Crawford v. Washington.

409
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,596
Any of you follow that?

410
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,037
It has to do with the admissibility
of ex parte examinations.

411
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,840
- That was a Supreme Court case?
- That's right.

412
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,233
How did it go? The only indicium
of reliability sufficient to satisfy...

413
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,756
constitutional demands
is the one the Constitution...

414
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,879
actually prescribes,
confrontation.

415
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,072
It's classic Scalia.

416
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:48,320
I can't help but think about victims forced
to confront their assailants in open court.

417
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,077
But on the other hand, the Sixth
Amendment is pretty controlling...

418
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,553
I'm sorry. I just...

419
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,229
I get rolling on constitutional questions.

420
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:02,553
Short answer,
I've been doing my level best.

421
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,790
Mr. McGill, is there anything you'd like
to tell us about the reasons...

422
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,917
you were suspended
in the first place?

423
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:15,077
This past year, that's pretty much
been the only thing on my mind.

424
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,992
And I'm humbled by the sheer stupidity
of my actions.

425
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,830
Remorse doesn't begin to cover it.

426
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:27,351
I'm not gonna make excuses,
because there's no excuse for what I did.

427
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,752
But as I sit here,
I can assure you...

428
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,795
nothing like that
will ever happen again.

429
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,640
Never.

430
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,760
Well, all right.
That would seem to be satisfactory.

431
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,391
Meg? You have something?

432
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,190
Mr. McGill,
what does the law mean to you?

433
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,592
The law?

434
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,639
Yeah. Okay.

435
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,719
Listen, growing up...

436
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,358
becoming a lawyer was the last thing
on my mind.

437
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,193
Even if I wanted to,
I didn't have the smarts or the skills...

438
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,829
or the stick-to-it-iveness.

439
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,358
But I happened to get a job
with some attorneys...

440
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,634
and I couldn't help but think,
maybe I could do that?

441
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,397
And something inside me
made me wanna try.

442
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,160
Now, listen.

443
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:41,877
My diploma says the University
of American Samoa Law School.

444
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:46,114
And that's exactly what it sounds like,
that's a correspondence school.

445
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,159
I wish it said Georgetown...

446
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,959
or Northwestern.

447
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:54,909
But UAS was the only one
that would take me.

448
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,434
Because, let me tell you,
I wasn't a natural.

449
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:04,356
I mean, the classes,
the studying, trying to pass the bar?

450
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,749
Practically killed me.

451
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,038
I must have quit 10 or 12 times...

452
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,160
but I kept coming back to it.
And I'm really glad I did.

453
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,836
Because when I got to work
with actual clients...

454
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,754
there was nothing else like it.

455
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:24,200
Our legal system is complicated,
and sometimes it could feel capricious...

456
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:28,149
but it's the closest thing
to real justice that we've got.

457
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:33,918
And for it to work, it needs vigorous,
passionate advocates.

458
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,436
Helping my clients, you know...

459
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,069
arguing on their behalf...

460
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,278
that's the best thing I've ever done.

461
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,711
And this past year...

462
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,791
I've missed the hell out of it.

463
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,711
That was very eloquent.

464
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:05,591
Was there any particular influence
on your views?

465
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,516
Credit where credit is due.

466
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,514
The University of American Samoa.

467
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,516
Go, Land Crabs.

468
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,156
Anything else?

469
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,996
- No. Thank you.
- No. Good?

470
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,880
I think we have everything we need.

471
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:35,556
You'll be getting a letter
with our decision in the next few days.

472
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,640
All right.

473
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,079
Thanks for your time.
All of you.

474
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:13,237
- I thought he was right up there.
- Yeah, he's part of the review process.

475
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,357
You've worked with him before.
Good guy?

476
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,677
Yeah. Really good guy.

477
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,671
- Hey. Hi.
- Hi.

478
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,990
- Mr. McGill.
- Yes.

479
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,358
I know they said I'd hear from them,
but just between you and me...

480
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,512
what'd they decide?

481
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,073
You've got to be kidding me.

482
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,560
No. No.

483
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,757
No, no, no.

484
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,839
No!

485
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,240
Hey. Wait a minute.

486
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,119
Wait. You're denying me?

487
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:55,671
- What did I do wrong?
- Mr. McGill, this is not the place.

488
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,639
I did everything right.
Please tell me.

489
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,994
Look.

490
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,720
These decisions are never easy.

491
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,156
Okay, come on, I deserve an answer.

492
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,997
- Please.
- Mr. McGill, I can't...

493
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,669
I did everything right.

494
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,400
It was a question of sincerity.

495
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,233
A what?

496
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:27,638
Some members of the committee
found you somewhat insincere.

497
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,160
You're free to apply again next year.

498
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,597
- Hey, Mike.
- Hey.

499
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,159
Well, how goes it
with the dirty half-dozen?

500
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,595
Playing volleyball.

501
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,070
That guy Kai cheats.

502
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,792
Werner's still talking?

503
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,032
They've been saying goodbye
for about 20 minutes now.

504
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,192
Anything of note?

505
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:16,275
They got a new puppy
and it's peeing everywhere.

506
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:20,677
The dog, the house. Her back's acting up
so they wanna go to the springs...

507
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,674
- at Baden-Baden once he gets back.
- So like the usual.

508
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,399
Yup.

509
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,951
Been at it almost an hour and a half.
Want me to give a 10-minute warning?

510
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:33,595
No. Let him go on
as long as he wants.

511
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,955
Wait, okay.

512
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,992
They're wrapping up.

513
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,396
She's gotta get to book club.

514
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,280
I'm gonna check the perimeter.

515
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,714
We have no problem
with that language and will adjust.

516
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,793
We do have a concern
on page 15, clause 4B.

517
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,633
Third paragraph. Begins...

518
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:02,158
The right to indemnification,
payment, reimbursement.

519
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,198
- Everyone with me?
- Yes, I see it.

520
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:07,159
This is clearly
a pro-sandbagging clause.

521
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,630
Troy, it simply gives us the right
to indemnification...

522
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,634
- for breaches of representations.
- Of which there are none.

523
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:16,038
We feel it's necessary given the fast pace
of the negotiations thus far...

524
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,510
and the lack of time
to complete due diligence.

525
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,359
Mesa Verde set the pace here.

526
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,592
Further, you're overstepping by
requiring parts of the target payment...

527
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,911
- be put aside as collateral.
- Kim Wexler here.

528
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,834
If I may respectfully remind you,
Mesa Verde is allowing you...

529
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,311
to keep a clause that warranty breaches
must be in a material respect.

530
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,596
It's standard language.

531
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,638
Yeah. As is ours.

532
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,395
Come on, guys, meet me halfway here.

533
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,553
Fine. Then we'd like to discuss
how we're defining knowledge...

534
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,837
- within the contract.
- Be my guest.

535
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,680
We feel that what we've established
is pretty reasonable.

536
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,150
- Our clients would like to propose...
- Hey there.

537
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,596
To the best
of the seller's knowledge.

538
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,434
- Slow down. Slow down.
- Fine. You have to give us a chance...

539
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,312
Insincere! Insincere!

540
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,153
- Jimmy, what happened?
- A goddamn year.

541
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,277
- What am I supposed to do for a year?
- Jimmy.

542
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:33,433
Guarantee I'm not selling phones
for a fucking year, I'll tell you that.

543
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,353
What did they say exactly?
How did they...?

544
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,556
Hard pass.

545
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,473
- All right.
- Don't tell me I can appeal...

546
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,439
because once the board hears
the word insincere, I'm screwed.

547
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,671
How do you disprove insincere?

548
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:47,356
Jimmy, just take a breath
and start from the beginning. Please.

549
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,752
I was good, Kim.

550
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,480
I mean, I wasn't stuck-up,
but I knew my shit.

551
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,360
Right? What have you been doing
during your suspension?

552
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,830
And have you been keeping up
with the law?

553
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,552
All fine. And then one, out of nowhere,
comes up with this weird-ass question.

554
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,871
What does the law mean to you?

555
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,953
- That's a big one.
- Huge. And I nailed it.

556
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,471
I talked about the meaning of the law
and I was down-to-earth...

557
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,711
and I was humble, I was sincere.

558
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,752
And they loved it.

559
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:19,476
- So...?
- So they turned me down.

560
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,438
Well, there has to be more
to it than that.

561
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,992
There's not.

562
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,879
I don't... What did they say
when you talked about Chuck?

563
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,718
What does Chuck have to do with this?
What?

564
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,394
So you didn't even...?

565
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,358
Why would I?

566
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,439
Okay.

567
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,758
Okay, listen, we will figure this out.

568
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:47,480
- And, yes, you will appeal.
- They're gonna rubber-stamp...

569
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:50,200
We won't let them. We'll find a way
to make you look sincere.

570
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:52,556
Kim, I was sincere.

571
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,074
I know that. I meant...

572
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,675
I might have been a little corny,
but I meant every word.

573
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,280
I know that.

574
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,589
You don't believe me.

575
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,994
- Of course I do.
- Jesus, it's right there on your face.

576
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,595
You think I'm some kind of lowlife,
some kind of asshole.

577
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,831
- What?
- The kind of lawyer guilty people hire.

578
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,754
- Jimmy, that's not...
- You look at me and see Slippin' Jimmy.

579
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:15,833
- I never said that.
- Yeah, but you thought it.

580
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:20,593
You wanna know why
the committee called you insincere?

581
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,513
Because you didn't mention Chuck.

582
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,075
What does that have to...?

583
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:26,476
They read the transcripts,
they know what happened.

584
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,677
They waited for you
to say something about him.

585
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:31,275
I'm supposed to make a hairy deal
about my dead brother...

586
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,432
at my reinstatement hearing?

587
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,954
How is that sincere?

588
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,153
I don't think about Chuck.

589
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,312
Okay? I don't miss Chuck.

590
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,791
Chuck was alive, and now he's dead,
and that's that.

591
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,599
Life goes on. So sue me.

592
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,470
See, there it is again.

593
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:49,279
That's why we don't have an office.

594
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,590
What? No.

595
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,513
Do not start in on that office.

596
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:55,115
I don't wanna hear another word
about that stupid office.

597
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,033
Stupid office? Okay, here we go.

598
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,193
Jimmy, I have been on your side
since the day we met.

599
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,790
Who comes running when you call?

600
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,872
Who cleans up your messes?

601
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:09,557
I have a job, but I drop everything for you.
Every single time.

602
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:12,519
You confess to a felony on tape,
I'm there.

603
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,831
You have a bar hearing,
I represent you.

604
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:19,080
Over and over again,
if you need me, I'm there.

605
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:23,553
But in your mind, the only measure
of my feelings for you is some office?

606
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:27,839
I'm good to live with, sleep with, but God
forbid you should have an office with me.

607
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,800
- What are you...? I just told you...
- You get bored with your life...

608
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,270
so you come roll around in the dirt,
have some fun...

609
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,272
- with Slippin' Jimmy, then back up.
- Fun?

610
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:38,279
Fun like lying to the ADA
to get your friend out of the shitter?

611
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,234
Fun like standing there
with a smile plastered on my face...

612
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,671
while you play mind games
on my law partner?

613
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:47,436
Oh, what a mistake it was
to take me up to your office in the sky.

614
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,592
- You'll never do that again.
- Maybe I won't.

615
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,513
Maybe next time you call,
I won't come.

616
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,070
There you go.
Kick a man when he's down.

617
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:58,674
Jimmy, you are always down.

618
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,711
I messed it all up.

619
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,831
You still want to be a lawyer?

620
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:52,560
Yeah.

621
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,951
Well, we can start with that.

622
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,360
Hey, Mike.

623
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,954
Hey.

624
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,394
Thanks.

625
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:33,511
- Thank you, sir.
- So, what do we got?

626
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,160
It's pretty quiet.

627
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:36,834
Kai was up late again.

628
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,437
About an hour after he went down,
Werner came out for a couple minutes.

629
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:46,352
Then Casper was up around 2:30,
watched some TV, headed back in.

630
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,433
What's going on with six?

631
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:55,196
There. What is that?

632
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,313
Oh, yeah.

633
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:59,949
- Dead pixels.
- Wasn't there yesterday.

634
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,913
Had a voltage spike earlier.

635
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:05,158
Camera flared for about 20 seconds,
but it came right back.

636
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:07,437
A voltage spike?

637
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:11,034
Any of other cameras do that?

638
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,471
Yeah, 10.

639
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,640
Show me the outside cameras.

640
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,991
You, let's go.

641
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:45,278
Get the lights!

642
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,236
Up there.

643
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,834
You check that out.

644
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,838
What's going on?

645
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,160
Mike.
