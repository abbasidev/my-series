1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,070
I think I got everything.

2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,035
If I forgot anything,
I'll just figure it out on the way.

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,197
- You're back on Thursday?
- Thursday. Yeah.

4
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,637
Unless we break down in Amarillo.

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,474
Kim, I want you to know...

6
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,311
I don't take this for granted.

7
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,551
It means a lot.

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,039
I'll see you Thursday.

9
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,359
Can I sit here?

10
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,714
Sure, man.

11
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,076
Just a word of warning...

12
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:47,235
I had a pile of cheese-chili fries
back at Stuckey's. With onions on top.

13
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,596
Last guy who sat there
didn't last five miles.

14
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,595
But, you know, welcome to it.

15
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,352
Jynetta.

16
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,477
Very nice,
I like the hearts over the I's.

17
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,871
- This is a real nice touch.
- Thank you.

18
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,394
- How many have you got?
- Ten.

19
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,994
Ten.

20
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,796
Alrighty.

21
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,513
Would you like
to do some postcards?

22
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,074
- Fifty cents per.
- Yeah.

23
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,391
- Different pens, please.
- Okay.

24
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,273
Oh, Bubba.

25
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,832
Okay.

26
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,437
I like your passion.

27
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,796
But would you maybe
tone down the anger?

28
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,200
Make it that you're sad
that you even have to write the letter.

29
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,274
I couldn't believe people could be
so heartless till I heard about you.

30
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,920
- Okay?
- Okay. Yeah, I got you.

31
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,753
- How many we got?
- Five.

32
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,273
- Would you like another batch?
- Yeah.

33
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,669
Yeah?

34
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,760
All right.

35
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,397
Different pens.

36
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,840
Chasity, let's see what you got.

37
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,078
Don't... Don't use swears.

38
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,796
I thought we talked about respect.

39
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,317
We're gonna have to lose that one.

40
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,994
I'm a little light.
Couldn't do nothing about it.

41
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,916
Some dumbass festival
over at the fairground, Indian shit.

42
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,434
Five-0 was all over.

43
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,398
But not real five-0, like, the rentals.

44
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,679
Can't sell in front of them neither.
We gonna make you right next time.

45
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,794
You're goddamned right you will.

46
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,037
For sure. Next week.

47
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,040
Hey.

48
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,280
Come here.

49
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,836
Nacho, man, I gotta get to getting...

50
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,513
Just come here.

51
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,677
What's up? What's up?

52
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,436
Shit.

53
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,113
What you owe, you owe.

54
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,237
With interest.

55
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,877
You had to do that, man.

56
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,635
Guy's not gonna learn otherwise.

57
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,872
So why didn't you do it?

58
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,117
What up, Domingo?

59
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,911
Can include headache, nausea,
dizziness and vision changes.

60
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,800
Committee is the proper place...

61
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,195
But she wasn't the only witness that...

62
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,639
- I didn't see it right away, but...
- It's magic.

63
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,674
And I just wanna show you
the real difference with this.

64
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,958
If you wanna see the scrub too,
it's that same idea.

65
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,956
It's just that simple.
Smells like fresh lavender too, ladies.

66
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,278
- And you just will not...
- Hey, baby. You're in early.

67
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,193
You in for the night?

68
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,159
Want us to make you some dinner?

69
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,074
Takes the color right out.
And this bottle has smoothing agents...

70
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,516
that protect your skin
while exfoliating.

71
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,279
Thanks, babe.

72
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,318
Are you gonna smoke with us?

73
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,838
- Look at that.
- It's just, well, I think that's incredible.

74
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,756
And I cannot believe we're still
offering this for under $70.

75
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,559
There's no way that lasts.

76
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,079
Get out of here?

77
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,520
- Keep an eye on them.
- You got it.

78
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,430
Did you know, Michael,
my father was also an engineer?

79
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,670
Yeah.

80
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,309
Worked from the day
he could hold a hammer.

81
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,598
Learned the work from doing the work.

82
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,912
Hands like knots of a tree.

83
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,159
You see over there?

84
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,317
He built that.

85
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,951
The Sydney Opera House.

86
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,875
Those concrete arches,
impossible in 1957.

87
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,710
Six years it took
to solve the problem. Six.

88
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,669
And years more to pour correctly.

89
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,910
To that,
my father gave 10 years of life.

90
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,912
Another stout?

91
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,120
You know, could I get the
Heefiweesen this time?

92
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,475
Sure.

93
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,756
No. Sir. Please. It's Hefeweizen.

94
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,914
Oh, I'm sorry.

95
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,230
How did you say it?

96
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,036
Hefeweizen.

97
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,393
It's on me.

98
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,913
Thanks, man.

99
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,516
Where was I?

100
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,875
The Opera.

101
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,872
It's for the ages.

102
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,920
For my father,
it was his achievement.

103
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,833
A creation that will endure.

104
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,516
What about you, Michael?

105
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,831
Your papa, what did he do?

106
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,512
My dad?

107
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,839
Left behind a cold-water flat
and a stack of bills. That's about all.

108
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,480
Not true.

109
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,916
He also left you, Michael.

110
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,874
You are his legacy.

111
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,589
Yeah.
You ever think about having kids?

112
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,513
Being a papa yourself?

113
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,672
Once, maybe.

114
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,077
My Margarethe...

115
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,551
she's enough for me.

116
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,949
She's my heart.

117
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,515
This is the longest
I've ever been away from her.

118
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,037
Twenty-six years...

119
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,876
never this long away from home.

120
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,875
To home.

121
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,309
Yeah.

122
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,474
Hey, Mike.

123
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,556
I gotta check on the boys.
You gonna be all right here?

124
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,160
Of course. I'll be fine. Go.

125
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,510
Sorry, Mike.
This guy slipped off for a private dance.

126
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,115
You're not throwing me out,
I paid my money.

127
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,438
You paid to look, not touch, asshole.
That's it.

128
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,634
I'm calling the cops. Let's see how
you like hanging out in MDC.

129
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,360
No, no, no.
You don't need to call the cops.

130
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,314
Who the hell are you?

131
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,631
I'm the guy telling you this one
has had too much...

132
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,678
and I'm here
to get him out of your hair.

133
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,038
What about his buddies?

134
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,078
They're not causing
any trouble, are they?

135
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,709
Let them stay a while longer.

136
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:15,470
This one?
This idiot goes home.

137
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,514
- Sleeps it off.
- No, no. I'm not going. I paid...

138
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,077
You are done.

139
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,911
Go on. Try me.

140
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,432
Get him out of here.

141
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,120
Sorry.

142
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,157
The girl, is she okay?

143
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,074
She's fine. Seen worse.

144
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,157
This is for her trouble.

145
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,073
All good?

146
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,871
Yeah, man. We're cool.

147
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,473
So...

148
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,633
Like this.

149
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,518
How about...?

150
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,197
Nein, nein, nein, Terry.

151
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,953
Support must be invisible.

152
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,914
Can't throw a column here,
a column there.

153
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,840
Maximum volume
and open space inside.

154
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,231
The final structure
has strict requirements.

155
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,074
- Load-bearing walls then.
- Very good.

156
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,550
Now you use your thinking head,
not your drinking head.

157
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,752
But how do you get walls in place?

158
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,389
They would be seven,
eight meters to a side.

159
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,750
Pre-pour off site.

160
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,354
Slide the slabs in with a crane.

161
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,596
Slide?

162
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,275
Through the existing construction?

163
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:56,191
You would knock down the Chrysler
Building just to add a subway stop.

164
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,400
No.

165
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,554
Time to go.

166
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,599
Why? Come sit with us.

167
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,353
Your wife's calling.

168
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,034
My wife?

169
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,393
Yeah.

170
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,559
Okay.

171
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,513
Thank you very much, gentlemen,
for your hospitality.

172
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,951
Good talking to you, Werner.

173
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,798
Oh, hey. You say something?

174
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,838
Yeah, I'm gonna head over
to the nail salon.

175
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,195
Finish setting up.

176
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,915
Oh, that's a good idea.
I'll see you later.

177
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,393
I won't be that long.

178
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,916
You want me to bring you something?
Maybe Flying Star?

179
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,198
I'm just gonna scrounge here.
I think we have some old Chinese.

180
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,033
Pick something up for yourself,
okay?

181
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,874
Yeah. Okay.

182
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,433
Leaving now. You stick around?

183
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,471
Yeah, I have...
Be here a little longer.

184
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,075
I'll lock up when I go.
Is that all right?

185
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,400
Wife mad at you?

186
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,552
She's not my wife...

187
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,280
I don't know.

188
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,399
Yeah. She's mad at you.

189
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,120
Go on.

190
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,034
You take her to dinner.

191
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,317
Nice place with a waiter.

192
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,675
Cloth napkin.

193
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,872
You bring flowers.

194
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,077
You say sorry.

195
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,674
Then say sorry again.

196
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,799
Whatever she says, you say sorry.

197
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,160
I think we might be past that.

198
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,838
I'll leave the bottle.

199
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,429
Are you ready for me?
I'm a little early.

200
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,080
No problem. Come on in.

201
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:16,277
This is Gary Strote,
Stef Carvaines, Pat Malakovsky.

202
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,159
- My associates.
- Hi.

203
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,760
- Suzanne Ericsen.
- Hello.

204
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,395
- Good to meet you all.
- Nice to meet you.

205
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,800
All right.
You have a response to our proffer?

206
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,155
We do. Time served.

207
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,997
Three to six months' probation.
We plead to simple battery.

208
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,796
- A misdemeanor?
- Yes.

209
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,200
You're asking to go from
18-months jail time down to nothing?

210
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,950
Sorry. I can't do that.

211
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,600
Okay.

212
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,752
This is a motion for continuance.

213
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,674
We're going to need more time
to prepare our defense.

214
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,595
The officer's report states that he didn't
canvass for additional witnesses.

215
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,194
There were none.

216
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,353
And no one is contesting that
Mr. Babineaux struck the officer.

217
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,592
Be that as it may, there are several
businesses nearby with cameras.

218
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,792
We need time to subpoena all of them.

219
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,640
Isn't that a bit much?

220
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,877
We don't believe
the judge will see it that way.

221
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,795
We'd simply like to have the most
complete information at our disposal.

222
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,679
To that end...

223
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,199
we're filing a motion
to compel discovery.

224
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,556
You want to open Officer Platt's
personnel file.

225
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,440
- Good luck with that.
- It's a reasonable Brady disclosure.

226
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,956
Officer Platt had a history with
Mr. Babineaux...

227
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,514
we'd like to know its extent.

228
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,720
And if there's any larger history
Officer Platt has with friends, relatives...

229
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:43,112
or colleagues of Mr. Babineaux,
we'd like to know that too.

230
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:46,478
You're thinking
of pursuing civil litigation?

231
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,632
We are in conversation with the ACLU.

232
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,400
Assessing the possibility that
Mr. Babineaux's civil rights...

233
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,313
may have been violated.

234
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,115
Okay. Is that all?

235
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,399
For now.

236
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,037
We will deal with
all these issues in turn.

237
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,635
And then we will set a trial date.

238
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,636
I think that's all
we have to talk about.

239
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,680
All right then.

240
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,197
Ms. Wexler, a word in private?

241
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,080
I'll catch up.

242
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:38,194
Kim. You're throwing three $400-an-hour
associates at a pro-bono case?

243
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,716
I never said this was pro bono.

244
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,793
Okay, what's the plan here, Kim?

245
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,191
Because shock and awe
isn't gonna cut it.

246
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,954
Bring every fancy associate you got,
file all the motions you want.

247
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,114
And at the end of all this,
your client is still going away.

248
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,314
Okay.

249
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,719
I guess we'll see.

250
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,832
Everyone seems much improved.

251
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:55,792
This R&R was a good idea, Michael.

252
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,273
Something the matter?

253
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,874
This?

254
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,075
Don't be concerned.

255
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,720
I said nothing.

256
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,951
Men at a bar, talking to make talk.

257
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,440
And look.

258
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,956
No details. No scale at all.

259
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:26,598
Could be a skyscraper,
could be a box for shoes.

260
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,960
I said nothing about the construction
that would not be true for 1000 others.

261
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,910
By now they've forgotten me entirely.

262
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,878
They forgot.

263
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,236
The German national
in the middle of Albuquerque...

264
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,552
talking about pouring
hundreds of tons of concrete...

265
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,360
at a secret underground location?

266
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,838
You're right.

267
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:57,478
I'm sorry, Michael.
I had too much beer.

268
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,111
And I may have said
more than I should have.

269
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,154
Listen to me carefully.

270
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,552
The man we're working for
is very serious.

271
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,233
Think about the precautions we take
to keep everything that goes on quiet.

272
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,712
Think about how much money
you're making.

273
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:22,311
Think about what happens
if something goes wrong.

274
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,273
Do you understand
what I am saying to you?

275
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,711
I do understand.

276
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,436
And I'm sorry to cause any problem.

277
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,953
You have my word.

278
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,240
Nothing like this will happen again.

279
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,394
Okay.

280
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,277
Let's get you to work.

281
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,439
I have one question for you,
Ms. Ericsen.

282
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,280
- Are you prosecuting Santa Claus?
- Your Honor?

283
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,040
Because it's like
Miracle on 34th Street in here.

284
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,554
This is just today.

285
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,719
Today's batch.

286
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,400
All addressed to me.

287
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,917
All from some backwater in Louisiana.

288
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,631
Get your hands off our hero,
they say.

289
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,871
Mercy for Huell Babineaux,
they say.

290
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,720
Like I'm sending him
to the electric chair.

291
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,794
Tell me, Ms. Wexler,
did you start this particular ball rolling?

292
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,276
Did I instruct the people of
Coushatta, Louisiana...

293
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,639
to start writing letters to the court?
No, Your Honor, I did not.

294
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:48,632
That being said, it's clear Mr. Babineaux
has touched the lives...

295
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,792
of many people in his hometown.

296
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,670
They're planning to send a contingent.
To show their support during the trial.

297
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,196
Are you talking about a bunch
of yahoos packing my court?

298
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,912
I'm sorry, Your Honor, but I'm not sure
what bearing any of this has on the case.

299
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,517
What does Mr. Babineaux's relationship
to his hometown in...?

300
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,796
Did you say Louisiana?

301
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,351
This can't be a complete surprise
to the Assistant District Attorney.

302
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,751
She knows the defendant's history
as well as I do.

303
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:16,231
If I get one more letter
from some swamp-dwelling do-gooder...

304
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,357
- I'm gonna scream.
- Thank you...

305
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,318
for bringing this to our attention.

306
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,756
May I see one of these?

307
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,792
Take as many as you want.
Yeah.

308
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,792
Please. Take them all.

309
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,594
I have looked at this case.

310
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,439
It does not merit a circus.

311
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,279
Now, you two work it out.

312
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,070
- We've tried, Your Honor.
- Try again.

313
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,233
Pull the Babineaux file.

314
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,559
Every parking ticket, every time
he is mentioned in the records.

315
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,632
You, call the arresting officer...

316
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,440
and find out what, if anything,
he left out of his reports.

317
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:54,560
I want known associates.
Places of residence.

318
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,996
MVD records. All of it.

319
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:00,198
We missed something,
and I wanna know what.

320
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,556
Right now. Go.

321
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,590
Ben.

322
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,200
What are we looking for?

323
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:13,833
I want to figure out why a pickpocket
has people this overheated.

324
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,109
Huell Babineaux
is wrongfully accused.

325
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,549
He's a good man.

326
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,076
He'd never do nothing like the things
you say he's done.

327
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,158
He's a kind man
and good friend to everyone.

328
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,357
Jesus. They do make him sound
like Santa Claus.

329
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,718
- This one has a phone number.
- Let me see this.

330
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,559
You've reached Elmer Fontaneau.

331
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,116
I'm not here at the moment,
but leave a message...

332
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,352
I'll get back at you soon as I can.
Have a blessed day.

333
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,035
Hello, Mr. Fontaneau.

334
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:05,070
My name is Suzanne Ericsen from the
Albuquerque District Attorney's office.

335
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,516
Could you give me a call
when you have a moment?

336
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,672
It's in regards to Huell Babineaux.

337
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:15,518
My number is 505-186-1945.

338
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,239
Thanks.

339
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,477
- Hello?
- Is this Eloise Luckard?

340
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:38,310
- Speaking.
- Hi, my name is Suzanne Ericsen.

341
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,759
I'm an Assistant District Attorney
in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

342
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:47,039
You wrote a letter to Judge Munsinger
about a Huell Babineaux.

343
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,396
Oh, I love Huell.

344
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,120
He's the dearest, dearest man.

345
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,478
Do you mind my asking,
how exactly do you know Huell?

346
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,632
Everyone in Coushatta knows Huell.

347
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,838
- He's a pillar of our church.
- Which church is that?

348
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:05,351
Free Will Baptist,
right over on Bogan Lane.

349
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:10,876
I've seen several letters from
fellow members of your congregation.

350
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:15,000
Could you explain to me,
is there some reason why Huell...

351
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,676
in particular holds so much esteem
in your church?

352
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:23,709
I'm sorry, who are you again?

353
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:28,238
I'm an Assistant District Attorney
from Albuquerque, New Mexico.

354
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,830
I'm handling a case that Mr. Babineaux
is involved in.

355
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,877
Handling how?

356
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,357
I'm prosecuting it.

357
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:41,434
You're the one persecuting our Huell?
How could you?

358
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:46,436
To go after someone so sweet
and kind with all those lies.

359
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:50,192
Well, I'd tell you
what I really think of you...

360
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:57,039
but Jesus is listening,
so I'll just say shame on you.

361
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,152
Okay.

362
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,509
All right.

363
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,751
Not too shabby.

364
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,039
I've been taking improv classes.

365
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,957
Oh, shit. Which one is it?

366
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,600
It's that one.

367
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:33,031
It's the church.
The church, the church.

368
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,680
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

369
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,352
Hello, there. Free Will Baptist,
Pastor Hansford speaking.

370
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,832
- Who this?
- Good afternoon, Pastor.

371
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,719
My name is Suzanne Ericsen.

372
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,714
I'm an Assistant District Attorney
from Albuquerque, New Mexico.

373
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:57,396
Oh, that's a long way off, cher.

374
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:01,679
Can you hold on a second?
Clarence is going at the organ.

375
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,595
I'm gonna step into the vestibule.

376
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,039
There we go.

377
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:13,400
Now, what can I do for you,
Ms. Ericsen, you say?

378
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,911
The court has received numerous
letters from members...

379
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:22,279
of your congregation in regards to
Mr. Huell Babineaux.

380
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,758
May I ask you a couple questions
about Mr. Babineaux?

381
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,799
Surely. What I can tell you
about our Huell?

382
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,113
Well, what kind of person
would you say Mr. Babineaux is?

383
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:38,958
Why, I'd say he's a lovely person,
both inside and out.

384
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:42,158
I'm sure you'd say that about
all your parishioners.

385
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,437
Right. I suppose I would.

386
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,752
No, no. But Huell, he's special.

387
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,755
He's got a heart as big
as Lake Pontchartrain.

388
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,914
Do you mind my asking,
what did he do...

389
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:59,551
to gain so much devotion
in Coushatta?

390
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,480
Well, ma'am, for starters...

391
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,917
he's a bona-fide hero.

392
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,831
- He's a hero?
- Yes, ma'am.

393
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,438
See, about a year ago,
there was a fire in the rectory.

394
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,990
It was during Bible study.

395
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,560
At night.

396
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,997
Because some of the old folks
around here...

397
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,949
they like to brush up on the Bible
before they go to sleep.

398
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:28,154
You know, get right
in case the Lord call them home.

399
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,118
- Yes.
- Wouldn't you know it...

400
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,000
there was a
short circuit in the coffeemaker.

401
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:37,359
Whole thing catch fire, and the flame
leaped up to the window sill.

402
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,472
Well, Huell happened to be visiting
his people, and he saw the smoke.

403
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,597
Well, what did he do?

404
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,359
He burst right in.

405
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,274
Carried out
every last one of them oldsters.

406
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,590
My goodness.

407
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,429
And what happened to the church?

408
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,239
The church is fine.

409
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,596
I shudder to think
what might've happened if God...

410
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,549
in his grace hadn't seen fit
to send old Huell.

411
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,915
I see.

412
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:11,911
Now, y'all sound like a real nice lady,
and I know you're only doing your job.

413
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,430
But I want you
to understand something.

414
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,069
I think you got the wrong end
of the stick here.

415
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,311
Huell Babineaux is important to us.

416
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,960
Now, he...

417
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,234
He would never hurt a police officer.

418
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,074
I believe it's just a misunderstanding.

419
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,800
I believe he might've been
helping his friend.

420
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,600
That's the Huell that I know.

421
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,269
Put that down, Clarence.

422
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,949
Get rid of them robes, now.
That's for communion.

423
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,351
Now, I will be with you presently.

424
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,471
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

425
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,314
No. No, Pastor.
Thank you for your time.

426
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,233
I think that's all.

427
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,475
Have you set a date yet
for Huell's trial?

428
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,310
No, not yet.

429
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,316
Would you do me a kindness
and ring me up when you do?

430
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,790
Because we got a couple of
charter buses.

431
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:07,038
We're gonna bring the whole
congregation up to y'all in Albuquerque.

432
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,473
I'll make sure to let you know.

433
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,080
Bless you.

434
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,232
And I look forward to meeting you.

435
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,113
Is it over?

436
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,360
All right.

437
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,673
Here's what we're gonna do.
I'm gonna take the church phone.

438
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,035
She might call back.

439
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:59,071
If any of these ring,
I want you to pick up every third caller.

440
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:04,076
Okay? Thirty seconds max,
stick to the script.

441
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,277
Let the rest go to voicemail.

442
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,952
So are we just supposed to...

443
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,231
hang around here till...?

444
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,120
You're paid for the day,
you stay until I say you can go.

445
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,754
Well?

446
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,235
Do it one more time?

447
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,432
You sure you can take it?

448
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,159
I can if you can.

449
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,398
All right. You asked for it.

450
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,433
Hello there.

451
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,638
Look in your heart, cher,
and find forgiveness.

452
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,077
Let us take you on a trip
down New Orleans way...

453
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,312
where they put a little extra roux
in the gumbo.

454
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,518
Oh, that's a beautiful red snapper.

455
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,275
It's wondermous, I guarantee.

456
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,477
Wow, it's like I'm in the bayou.

457
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,712
Yes, well, I got crawdads in my pants.

458
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:58,480
- That's not a thing.
- It's a thing that happens to you...

459
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,990
when you're sitting in the bayou.

460
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,193
The phones were genius.

461
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,471
- The phones?
- Yeah.

462
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,198
Well, the phones were a touch.

463
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,756
This was all you, start to finish.

464
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,191
Bank shot off the judge.

465
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:19,592
Four months' probation, time served.

466
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,640
It's like watching Roy Hobbs
smash out stadium lights.

467
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,872
Yeah, but the DA overplayed her hand.

468
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,440
Yeah.

469
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,320
Gotta go?

470
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,800
Yeah.

471
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,399
What are you up to today?

472
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:48,671
I'm gonna check out an office
on Lomas, down by the courthouse.

473
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,797
I thought you already found one.

474
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:55,079
That one was a little more office
than I needed.

475
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,872
You working late?

476
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,712
Playing catch up.

477
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,070
All right.

478
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,720
I gotta go.

479
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,037
I gotta go, I gotta go.

480
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:32,633
The near-term window is set,
but we have to hit every target...

481
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,280
to stick to that timetable.

482
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,399
As we look down the road,
we get more flexibility.

483
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:40,200
When we get to rollouts
in the six-to-12 month timeline...

484
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,716
and beyond,
we have some breathing room.

485
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,760
It's an opportunity to retrench and
meet our minimum capital requirements.

486
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,794
We should be stable as a table
by the time we start on Wyoming.

487
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,475
Sounds good.

488
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,154
We should talk about Wyoming.

489
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,596
Six months is gonna go by fast.

490
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,318
Unless, Kevin,
did you have something?

491
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:08,316
Sorry. I don't wanna slow us down.
Paige will hate me for bringing this up.

492
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,840
What's on your mind?

493
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,356
The foot traffic
at Tucumcari is off the charts...

494
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,637
and that's driving
a lot of new accounts.

495
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:21,237
Seems to me it's because
the building itself is damn eye-catching.

496
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,154
Now, I want to hit all the milestones
we're talking about.

497
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:28,155
And Paige tells me
what I'm gonna ask is impossible...

498
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:32,274
but what if we made the Lubbock
branch the same as Tucumcari?

499
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:35,512
I reminded Kevin that Tucumcari
has a much larger footprint...

500
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,273
than the current Lubbock design.

501
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,353
And that design is the one
we've been hanging our estimates on.

502
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:43,274
I know, I know.
We're down the road a ways on this.

503
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,433
But what do you think, Kim?

504
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,394
Can you pull another rabbit
out of the hat for us?

505
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,755
Kevin, I'm sorry.

506
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,998
But I have to agree with Paige.

507
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:02,877
It took almost two months to get
local approval for the current design.

508
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,520
Starting over now?

509
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,912
There's simply no way
we could stick to our timetable.

510
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,397
I hate to say it...

511
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,912
but it is, it's unfeasible.

512
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,149
Okay.

513
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,960
I get it. I had to ask.

514
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:20,316
Paige, you were right. This time.

515
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,279
All right. Wyoming, then.

516
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,911
Yellowstone, here we come.

517
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,275
Great.

518
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,352
So looking to Wyoming...

519
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:32,519
we are moving forward
with market research, as planned.

520
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,994
Space is closing in
on rough final dimensions.

521
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,197
Most of the spoil's out and dispersed.

522
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,750
The tunnel's holding and it's clear.

523
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:16,119
The front loader
hit this support stanchion.

524
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,272
Guys had it back up in an hour.

525
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,233
No permanent damage.

526
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:24,953
Then the form
they use to pour cement into...

527
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,600
it's totaled.

528
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:30,515
We're gonna have to make a new one
before we can go back to the wall.

529
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:34,435
So we're looking at four,
maybe five days for that.

530
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,478
Could've been worse.

531
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,960
That rock, that is more of an issue.

532
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:45,716
It is smack dab in the middle
of our elevator shaft.

533
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:48,270
Can't work around it,
can't dig it out.

534
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,999
So we're back to blasting.

535
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:55,110
Set up, clearing away debris...

536
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,513
adds maybe another week.

537
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:01,399
Best estimate,
we're a little past the halfway point.

538
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:05,520
Way behind schedule,
but the work is solid.

539
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,993
And Werner?

540
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,760
I gave him the come-to-Jesus.

541
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,196
He screwed up. He knows it.

542
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:19,079
Said it won't happen again.

543
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,118
And what do you say?

544
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,032
I've got eyes on him.

545
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,556
But, yeah. He's good.

546
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,514
Good.

547
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,800
Is that water?

548
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,680
The landlord will kick in
for small repairs like that.

549
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,116
They already took care
of the rodent problem.

550
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,319
Rodent problem?

551
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,473
You asked for small and near court.
This is both.

552
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,912
And it's in your price range.

553
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:04,151
Use your imagination.

554
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,152
Think creatively.

555
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,999
Excuse me for a sec, would you?

556
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,913
Yeah. Take your time.

557
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,994
Hey.

558
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,072
This your new office?

559
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,359
It's a contender.

560
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,437
What are you doing here?

561
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,549
I was driving.

562
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:33,120
Saw your Esteem in the parking lot.

563
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,479
So, what's up?

564
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,080
Nothing.

565
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,878
Just driving around.

566
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,997
Thinking about things.

567
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:56,390
Listen, Kim, I...
I know what's on your mind.

568
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:00,278
That thing that we did,
I mean, it was nuts.

569
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:05,434
And I dumped it in your lap.

570
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,277
Ex parte communication...

571
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,113
contempt of court.

572
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:13,358
I mean, what, talking about
a couple hundred counts of mail fraud?

573
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,752
I could've wrecked you at Schweikart.
I could've boned me too.

574
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,355
I'm this close to being reinstated.

575
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,477
I mean, come on.

576
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:26,435
Kim.

577
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,555
Don't worry.
No one's gonna know about it.

578
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:32,353
Be like it never happened.

579
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,716
And, also, I agree.

580
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,714
We are totally done with all that.

581
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,758
Over and out.

582
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:41,719
No more.

583
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,559
Let's do it again.

584
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,038
Oh, hey.

585
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,192
You're here! Right on time.

586
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:02,272
Hold on one second. Wait.

587
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:06,191
You are going to love this.

588
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:07,999
I made this just for you.

589
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:12,359
Never in your life have you tasted
something so delicious, it's true. Wait...

590
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:16,115
You're gonna die.

591
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:19,715
No, thank you.

592
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,113
Smell it!

593
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:26,192
You can't say no, are you crazy?

594
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,829
I used epazote. Come on.

595
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,112
Very well. You're not hungry.

596
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:34,909
That's your problem.

597
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:40,670
This is a special recipe.
A family secret.

598
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,599
- Salamanca family?
- Them!

599
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:48,960
I am Eduardo.

600
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:50,634
But you can call me Lalo.

601
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:54,157
And you must be Varga, no?

602
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:58,518
They told me you were smart.
And look...

603
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,514
here you are, and you are.

604
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,433
What are you doing here?

605
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,193
I'm just here to lend a helping hand.

606
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:17,149
Make sure business
is running in order.

607
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:20,518
I got...
I got a good head for numbers.

608
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,154
But, listen...

609
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:24,752
don't even worry.

610
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:26,991
It's gonna be like I'm not even here.

611
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,432
Come on, Varga. Let's go!
