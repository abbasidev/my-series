1
00:01:20,514 --> 00:01:21,538
Six every touchdown.

2
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:24,343
- But who keeps track of that?
- It's all on the computer.

3
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:27,510
Computer does everything.
Every stat gets converted into points.

4
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:30,122
I don't know.
Sounds kind of dumb, to be honest.

5
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,282
- I just wanna watch the game.
- You're afraid to lose 20 bucks.

6
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:37,123
You wanna bet, let's do it.
Why mess with all this extra stuff?

7
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:41,859
Trust me, it's fun. You end up cheering
for a lot of weird things on Sunday.

8
00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:02,884
He's no longer in a coma,
but he's unresponsive.

9
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:04,614
His condition is stable.

10
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,782
They're managing his blood pressure.

11
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,554
But whether he will wake up...

12
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:12,494
and understand
what's going on around him...

13
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,463
there's no way of knowing.

14
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,899
That's unacceptable.

15
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:20,795
Gustavo, he's getting
very good care here.

16
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:24,432
There's very little
even the best hospitals could do.

17
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:26,639
Now...

18
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:30,114
might it be different
if he was in the care...

19
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:35,585
of someplace
like Johns Hopkins perhaps?

20
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,353
Or...

21
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:43,688
it could make no difference at all.

22
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:47,493
But in the end...

23
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:50,862
In the end...

24
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,631
I can think of no better judgment
on this man.

25
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:02,471
Isn't this what he deserves?

26
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:07,045
I decide what he deserves.

27
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:13,221
No one else.

28
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:09,409
There she is.

29
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:11,944
Want some fresh OJ?

30
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,684
Good. Vitamin C.
It'll help you heal quicker.

31
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:17,847
I don't think it works like that.

32
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:20,083
It might. You don't know.

33
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,955
I'm good.

34
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:25,895
Oh, I've also got leftover bacon
from my breakfast sandwich.

35
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:28,261
That's got definite healing powers.

36
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,096
Okay, that I believe.

37
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,467
And I made coffee,
put a little cinnamon in it for flavor.

38
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,608
Just trying something different.

39
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:38,267
- You're up early.
- Yeah.

40
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:41,141
- Oh, did I wake you with the noise?
- No. No, not at all.

41
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:44,708
- I totally did, didn't I?
- No, I was getting up...

42
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:47,376
- Sorry. I got job interviews lined up.
- Eventually.

43
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:48,953
I wanted to get an early jump.

44
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,421
I'm starting down south,
office manager interview in Polvadera...

45
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:55,459
then I'm working my way
up north to Algodones.

46
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,324
I got a lot of ground to cover.

47
00:04:57,497 --> 00:05:00,466
Jimmy, you know,
you can take some time off.

48
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:04,628
Nobody's gonna ding you for not having
a steady job right this minute.

49
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:08,167
Why wait?

50
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:11,338
I don't want unemployment
hanging over my head.

51
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:14,309
And we could use
another paycheck, and...

52
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:16,977
Besides, this is your office now.

53
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,948
- I don't wanna be a distraction.
- You're not a distraction.

54
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,588
That's right.
Because I'll be out finding me a job.

55
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:23,780
Wish me luck.

56
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:25,652
Good luck.

57
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,693
Thai or Mexican?

58
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:31,353
I'm gonna pick up dinner
on the way back.

59
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:33,463
Either. Your choice.

60
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:35,430
And what a choice it shall be.

61
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:38,202
Yeah. Okay. Jimmy, wait. Are you...?

62
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:40,202
You're not going to that meeting?

63
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:44,833
No. If there's anything important,
Howard knows how to find me.

64
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:40,430
It's just me.

65
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:00,041
Papa.

66
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,410
It's over.

67
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:49,459
You can keep that.

68
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,435
No one's coming for it.

69
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,098
Mijo.

70
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:34,272
And when is it over for you?

71
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:37,974
I'm working on it.

72
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,047
Hi.

73
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:27,992
You see there, that's Alma,
and on the left is Ollie...

74
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:29,567
Mr. Neff's aunt and uncle.

75
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:32,899
They started this company
almost 50 years ago.

76
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,067
- Look at that.
- Yeah.

77
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,402
And we think that other fellow
is Frank Corker.

78
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,908
One of the early repairmen.

79
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,843
They must've relied on him a lot.
That's a Thermo-Fax.

80
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:45,849
It needed a specially-coated paper
to get an image off one of those babies.

81
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,384
You know your stuff.

82
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:50,523
I worked in a mail room,
so I talked to a lot of repairmen.

83
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,749
A lot. They love talking shop.

84
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:56,692
Yes. They are a lonely bunch, for sure.

85
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:01,394
This one was a real big seller for Neff,
really put us on the map.

86
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:04,560
That's a 6500 color copier.
That's a warhorse.

87
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:08,264
You ever see the guts of this beast?
It takes 15 seconds to get a printout.

88
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,933
- I worked with one back in Chicago.
- That machine was almost too good.

89
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:15,138
Counterfeiters used it
to make phony $5 bills.

90
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:17,783
- What? That's...
- Yeah.

91
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,919
That's not right.

92
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,813
Oh, look. You got a lot
of hardware over here.

93
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:26,288
Yes, Mr. Neff loves
sponsoring the kids.

94
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:30,156
- Bowling, that's fun.
- We had a pretty good run in the '90s...

95
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,458
but we don't find kids
much interested anymore.

96
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:37,330
Yeah, this generation is all hacky sack
and video games.

97
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:39,995
Ain't that the truth? Yeah.

98
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,898
Hummels.

99
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:44,407
Yes. Those were Alma's.

100
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:48,104
She loved collecting the little things.
God rest her soul.

101
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:51,580
Yeah, I knew a lady. Same way.

102
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:56,478
Touring the wall of crap, I see.
I need to drag that stuff to the dumpster.

103
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,521
Haven't had a chance
to motivate myself.

104
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:00,852
- Mr. Neff, James McGill.
- Just Jimmy is fine.

105
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:04,690
Jimmy. Pleasure.
Come on down, have a seat.

106
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:07,529
Guessing Henry filled you in
on what we look for?

107
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,997
He did indeed.

108
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,864
Office-to-office salesman...

109
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,631
willing to have multiple doors
slammed in my face...

110
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:15,273
with one mission.

111
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:17,272
Upgrade, upgrade, upgrade...

112
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:20,207
their old copiers
to your top-of-the-line new ones.

113
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,938
You think you have the chops?

114
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:25,482
- It's a lot harder than it sounds.
- I'd sure love a crack at it.

115
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:27,643
I'm told stubbornness
and persuasiveness...

116
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,879
are two of my top qualities.

117
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:32,320
I have to say,
he knows his way around a copier.

118
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:34,119
No kidding.

119
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,960
Well...

120
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,291
Says here you were a lawyer...

121
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:47,398
up until not that long ago.

122
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:51,042
What changed?

123
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:55,546
Well, you know why God
made snakes before he made lawyers?

124
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,910
He needed the practice.

125
00:11:58,484 --> 00:11:59,508
Needed the practice.

126
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:01,244
- Yeah.
- Right?

127
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:05,152
That's the only lawyer joke I know
because all the others are true stories.

128
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:09,193
Look, I know you're looking for
somebody with sales experience...

129
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:10,852
and I don't have any.

130
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:14,431
Except... Except being a lawyer.

131
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:17,662
Look, being a lawyer,
my job was sales.

132
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:21,034
I was selling to judges, juries,
sometimes I was selling to clients...

133
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:23,732
to take the best deal
from a series of bad options.

134
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,902
But every hour of every day,
I was convincing...

135
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,548
persuading, I was selling.

136
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:32,685
I hear what you're saying.

137
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:36,754
We have a lot of high-ticket items,
and a clientele primed to say no.

138
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:41,792
Well, my spirit animal is a Gila monster,
and once I latch on, I don't let go.

139
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:45,462
I like it, I like it.

140
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:48,730
Well, you make a lot of
excellent points, Jimmy.

141
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:51,301
I can see why Henry
wanted me to meet you.

142
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:53,769
- Thank you for coming down.
- Absolutely. Anytime.

143
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,932
We'll put our heads together,
have a decision in about a week.

144
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,873
- We'll let you know then.
- Thank you.

145
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:00,740
- You bet.
- Thanks. Great.

146
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,671
- Yes?
- I'm sorry, can I have another minute?

147
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:32,105
I'll be real quick.

148
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:35,805
Yeah, sure, Jimmy.
What's on your mind?

149
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:39,281
I know you're gonna take time,
consider your options...

150
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:41,977
but maybe we can
settle this right now.

151
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,953
There's a thing that we all know
called opportunity cost.

152
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:48,582
The time you spend looking for someone
is time I could be working for you.

153
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:53,289
And sure, there are salesmen out there
with way more experience than me.

154
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:56,697
What are the chances one will
walk through that door in the next week?

155
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:59,099
And is it worth the wait?

156
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:00,671
Maybe. Maybe.

157
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:03,706
But I can tell you this.

158
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:07,175
None of them will have the connection
to your machines that I do.

159
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:08,609
None.

160
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:10,373
I worked in the mail room.

161
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:14,884
I know how important the copy machine is.
Deadlines, last-minute changes.

162
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,284
I was in there, clearing paper jams.

163
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:20,119
I was cleaning ink
off gears and rollers...

164
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:23,956
trying to figure out where
the mystery streaks were coming from.

165
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,859
I was down on my hands and knees...

166
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:28,660
with my tie over my shoulder
and ink-stained hands...

167
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:32,965
and a line of assistants out the door,
all worried they're gonna lose their job...

168
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:35,835
if they don't get their document
the next five minutes.

169
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:38,636
I know, I know better than anyone...

170
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:43,077
that the copier,
it's the beating heart of any business.

171
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:46,650
It goes down, it causes delays,
that is lost money...

172
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:49,982
that is frustrated employees,
that's a negative work environment.

173
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:52,420
That's a business on life support.

174
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:56,358
But you plug one of your new machines
into the system...

175
00:14:57,263 --> 00:15:01,563
that is a healthy, strong heartbeat.

176
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:05,929
That is a healthy business.

177
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,840
That is successful business.

178
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:11,272
And that's what we're selling.

179
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:18,110
One minute.

180
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:29,953
- I don't need to see anymore.
- I mean, he's kind of exciting.

181
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:33,526
He's great. The passion
that this gentleman has...

182
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:36,566
- Can you imagine sending that guy out?
- Yeah. Come on.

183
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,462
Jimmy.

184
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:40,128
Welcome to the team.

185
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:42,765
- Really?
- Damn right.

186
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,638
Congrats. We'll get you set up
with Audrey in HR.

187
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:49,248
Fill out your paperwork. Hopefully,
you'll be all set by end of day.

188
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:51,080
So just like that, huh?

189
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,218
Yep. Why wait
when we can get you rolling?

190
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:57,254
You were gonna take some time,
consider your options...

191
00:15:57,423 --> 00:16:00,324
but I just come in
and did that little song and dance...

192
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,057
and I'm in?

193
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:04,719
Yeah. Right. That's right.

194
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:08,658
Are you out of your mind?

195
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:11,627
You don't know me.

196
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,136
I just came in off the street.

197
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,002
You guys are like a couple of cats.

198
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:19,736
I come in, wave a shiny object around,
you're like, I want that.

199
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,812
No due diligence,
no background check.

200
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:27,515
No. Just hire the guy
that says them fancy words.

201
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:31,521
I could be a serial killer. I could be
a guy who pees in your coffee pot.

202
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:33,454
I could be both.

203
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:38,253
- So you're not taking the job?
- No, I'm not taking the job.

204
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:40,296
Suckers.

205
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,666
I feel sorry for you.

206
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,642
Hello. I'm wondering,
are you still interviewing...

207
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:31,578
for the sales associate position?

208
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:36,512
Great. I can be there in 20 minutes.

209
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:39,814
James McGill.

210
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:45,095
Ellen, okay. Wonderful.
Well, thank you, Ellen. I'll see you soon.

211
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,552
Pop-Pop, look how high I can go.

212
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:12,748
Yeah, that's good.

213
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,859
You be careful.

214
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:16,790
You wanna do a couple more?

215
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:23,634
Okay.

216
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,394
Yeah?

217
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:28,801
This is he.

218
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:34,875
Meet at what time?

219
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,980
Yeah, I can be there.
You let her know.

220
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,649
Yeah.

221
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:46,084
All right, baby.

222
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:48,453
Time to get you back to your mama.

223
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:49,993
Five more minutes?

224
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:53,757
- Oh, honey, come on.
- Please?

225
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:56,325
Five minutes.

226
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:57,833
You're on the clock.

227
00:18:58,004 --> 00:18:59,938
Thank you.

228
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,692
- Good afternoon.
- Yeah. Madrigal Electromotive?

229
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,929
Down the hall,
the Sandia Room on your left.

230
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:34,436
Thank you.

231
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:49,945
Oh, good.

232
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,714
Take a seat.

233
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:16,311
You didn't come all this way
just for me.

234
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:19,508
I frequently travel
to conference with distributors.

235
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:22,518
Albuquerque is one of many stops.

236
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:26,753
Okay.

237
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:29,754
I'm just...

238
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,560
looking for an explanation.

239
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,667
You steal an employee's badge...

240
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:38,565
waltz through my warehouse,
interfere with operations...

241
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:41,605
and strong-arm my facility manager.

242
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:42,934
Why?

243
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:45,839
I'm on your books
as a security consultant.

244
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:50,004
If I show my face in your warehouse,
it makes for a better cover story.

245
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,776
Anyone ever ask if I was there, I was.

246
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:57,781
Plus, you had a few things that needed
correcting, so consider it a bonus.

247
00:20:57,957 --> 00:21:01,757
That's not the point.
This is meant to be a paper transaction.

248
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,953
You sit at home and we pay you.

249
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:06,894
Your own money.

250
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:11,362
Doing what you did, the way you did it,
raises the threat of exposure.

251
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,933
The way I see it, it lowers the threat.

252
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:19,271
Like I said, now there's a face
to the name that cashes the check.

253
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:24,142
So...

254
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,282
what's your plan then?

255
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:31,220
Madrigal has eight terminals
in the southwest.

256
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,654
One down, seven to go.

257
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,391
And if I asked you to reconsider?

258
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:43,091
I'd ask you to do the same.

259
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:04,418
At the moment,
you have Gus Fring's respect.

260
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:07,592
I'd want to keep that if I were you.

261
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:43,520
Hello. Hi.

262
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:46,062
Sorry to interrupt, Dr. Diseth...

263
00:22:46,232 --> 00:22:50,066
this is Dr. Maureen Bruckner,
just arrived this morning.

264
00:22:50,236 --> 00:22:52,466
- Nice to meet you. Hello.
- Dr. Bruckner.

265
00:22:52,638 --> 00:22:55,334
Dr. Bruckner's visiting
from Johns Hopkins.

266
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:58,965
We're asking her to take the lead
with some of the more severe cases...

267
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:02,045
- including Mr. Salamanca.
- Johns Hopkins?

268
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:05,911
Yes, a generous grant came through
which allowed Dr. Bruckner...

269
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:08,883
- to lend us her expertise.
- Only temporarily.

270
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:12,023
I'm not here to step on any toes.

271
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:15,224
Okay, I...

272
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:19,160
Our staff can help with the database
whenever you're ready to pull records...

273
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:22,232
but I'm available anytime
if you have any questions.

274
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:25,393
Thank you. Again,
I don't wanna step on toes.

275
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:29,098
- We can comanage care, if you like, we...
- No, no.

276
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:32,908
- He's all yours. Good luck.
- Thank you.

277
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:39,173
Okay.
Well, I will let you get to it then.

278
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:42,411
Let us know if there's anything you need,
anything at all.

279
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:43,850
Absolutely.

280
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:45,388
Thank you.

281
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:46,888
Are you the family?

282
00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:51,759
Are you the family?

283
00:23:55,034 --> 00:23:56,695
- Yes.
- Sons.

284
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:00,101
He's our uncle.

285
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,967
I want to let you know...

286
00:24:02,141 --> 00:24:05,736
that your uncle has been getting
excellent care here at Lovelace.

287
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:08,436
But we're going to try something
a little different.

288
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:12,550
Look, when parts of the brain
are damaged by a stroke...

289
00:24:12,718 --> 00:24:14,948
those parts, they cannot be repaired.

290
00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:19,255
Our job is to stimulate
your uncle's brain...

291
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:21,450
and teach it to rewire itself.

292
00:24:21,994 --> 00:24:24,326
We are going to start here
with the legs.

293
00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:30,235
When did they get here?

294
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:36,465
Don't worry. We're still running things.

295
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,135
Hello.

296
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:44,308
Are you family as well?

297
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:45,507
Friends of the family.

298
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:47,117
Okay.

299
00:24:47,286 --> 00:24:48,810
As I was saying...

300
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:51,957
I'll return later with
an occupational therapist...

301
00:24:52,124 --> 00:24:55,423
to begin some electrical stimulus.
In the meantime...

302
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:57,994
I'd ask that you speak to Hector.

303
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:02,361
Chances are, on some level,
he can hear you.

304
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:06,861
The more you speak, the more
his brain will work to respond...

305
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:10,539
and find pathways to connect.

306
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:12,176
Okay? Good.

307
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:15,644
We'll do everything we can
to help your uncle.

308
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:18,112
Nice to meet you all.

309
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:32,353
Speak.

310
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:56,882
Don Hector.

311
00:25:57,923 --> 00:26:00,153
Everything is good out on the street.

312
00:26:05,431 --> 00:26:09,731
All our men are keeping busy.

313
00:26:10,202 --> 00:26:12,363
Real busy.

314
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:14,697
That's right, Don Hector.

315
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:17,735
We're staying on top of the count.

316
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,009
It's all looking good.

317
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:28,513
We had a problem with that
shit gang over on Lomas, but...

318
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:30,882
we showed some muscle.

319
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:33,053
Took care of it.

320
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:36,559
No one wants to mess
with the Salamancas.

321
00:26:37,129 --> 00:26:38,118
No one.

322
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:05,386
You look good, Don Hector.

323
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:07,949
Real good.

324
00:27:08,894 --> 00:27:11,488
The doctors, they're gonna fix you up.

325
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:19,392
Yes.

326
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,574
You're gonna get past this...

327
00:27:25,611 --> 00:27:28,603
and be stronger than ever.

328
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:02,142
- Yes?
- It's me.

329
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:03,372
Can we meet?

330
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:05,642
- Now is not a good time.
- I'm in town.

331
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:08,285
I can easily meet
wherever's convenient.

332
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:11,320
Assume this is a secure line.

333
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:15,488
I spoke with your security contractor.

334
00:28:15,661 --> 00:28:18,630
I explained the situation again.

335
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:21,527
But he's going to keep doing
what he's doing.

336
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,565
I understand.

337
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:27,398
But what he's doing makes no sense.

338
00:28:27,573 --> 00:28:30,474
- Do his reasons matter?
- They do if he's unreliable.

339
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:32,132
He is reliable.

340
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:36,408
So I'm just supposed to let him
keep stealing my employees' badges?

341
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:38,516
I don't know where he'll turn up next...

342
00:28:38,684 --> 00:28:41,744
what disruption he'll cause,
what mess I'll have to clean up.

343
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:44,180
This isn't something
I want to worry about.

344
00:28:44,356 --> 00:28:47,189
Then I suggest you give
the man a badge.

345
00:28:53,432 --> 00:28:56,765
Varga and Salamanca's man, Colon,
they came by in the afternoon.

346
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:58,527
Nephews were in his room all day.

347
00:28:58,704 --> 00:29:01,537
Bruckner saw him three times,
couple of specialists with her.

348
00:29:01,707 --> 00:29:04,005
They took him for a brain scan.

349
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:06,107
And?

350
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:09,040
That's everything. No change.

351
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:53,289
You want me back at the hospital?

352
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:00,121
No.

353
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:03,997
Call Victor.

354
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:05,932
Have him meet us.

355
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,328
Just a few more.

356
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,899
I know Chuck was thorough...

357
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:13,231
but even I didn't think there was
gonna be this much paperwork.

358
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:15,731
Having worked with him
as long as I did...

359
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:19,365
I was actually pleasantly surprised
by his restraint.

360
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:23,538
This is the agreement for the transfer
of property, as discussed.

361
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,307
If you can initial here.

362
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:29,415
And right down here.

363
00:31:29,588 --> 00:31:32,318
- Am I late?
- Kim. No, right on time.

364
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:35,893
We were just finishing up
Rebecca's side of things.

365
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:37,255
Hi, Rebecca.

366
00:31:37,429 --> 00:31:39,488
It's nice to see you again.

367
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:43,262
I'm sorry we didn't get a chance
to talk more at the service.

368
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:46,529
Oh, I don't think
anyone felt much like talking.

369
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:50,065
- Jimmy's not coming?
- I'm here on his behalf.

370
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:52,335
And that should do it.

371
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:56,447
I apologize for bringing us
together so soon after Chuck's service.

372
00:31:56,615 --> 00:31:58,014
It's really my fault.

373
00:31:58,183 --> 00:32:00,117
Howard's being polite.

374
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:01,718
Thank you, Julie.

375
00:32:03,355 --> 00:32:07,052
In any event, we thought
since Rebecca was still in town...

376
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:09,921
better to talk through
the estate in person.

377
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:11,255
Sure.

378
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,193
Chuck left the house to Rebecca...

379
00:32:13,365 --> 00:32:16,095
and as executor,
I'll be liquidating the property.

380
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:19,863
Howard suggested, and of course,
I agree, that it would be the right thing...

381
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:23,439
for Jimmy to go through whatever
survived and take whatever he wants.

382
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:26,937
- I mean, anything with sentimental value.
- We can set up a time.

383
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:30,707
The estate can provide a truck and
storage for anything he chooses to keep.

384
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:32,076
That's okay.

385
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,945
Jimmy doesn't want any of it.

386
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:35,708
You sure?

387
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:39,254
I think the garage is pretty intact,
except for some water damage.

388
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:42,154
He doesn't want it. Thank you.

389
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:46,825
Okay. I understand.

390
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:49,664
Well, then...

391
00:32:49,835 --> 00:32:51,427
as far as Jimmy's concerned...

392
00:32:51,603 --> 00:32:54,572
all that's left is for him
to sign this agreement letter.

393
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:59,176
Once that's done,
we can disperse his share of the estate.

394
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:01,676
Let me guess. Four thousand?

395
00:33:03,782 --> 00:33:05,079
Five.

396
00:33:06,585 --> 00:33:10,282
It's what you give when you cut someone
from a will and not have it contested.

397
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:13,788
Just enough money to show
the recipient wasn't forgotten.

398
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:19,263
Chuck also left a substantial endowment
for a scholarship for deserving youth.

399
00:33:19,431 --> 00:33:23,128
I was hoping Jimmy would agree
to serve on the board.

400
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:25,830
I'll let him know.

401
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:27,965
What else?

402
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:29,663
Well...

403
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:32,972
Chuck left Jimmy a personal letter.

404
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,775
His eyes only.

405
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:48,323
Howard, thank you for everything
that you've done.

406
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:50,154
I know it's been difficult.

407
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:52,853
It's hard on all of us.

408
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:56,663
Well, I don't wanna keep you.
Let me walk you out.

409
00:33:56,835 --> 00:34:00,236
Actually, Howard,
we have a few more things to discuss.

410
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:05,207
Kim, please give Jimmy my best.

411
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:07,811
I will.

412
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:10,072
It was very nice seeing you, Rebecca.

413
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:11,806
You too.

414
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,081
Safe travels.

415
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,055
- Kim.
- I just...

416
00:34:26,698 --> 00:34:28,563
I just...

417
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:31,827
had to know...

418
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:33,994
what were you thinking?

419
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:36,530
About?

420
00:34:36,708 --> 00:34:38,676
When you came to Jimmy...

421
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:42,040
on the day of his brother's funeral
and laid that shit on him?

422
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:45,011
That Chuck killed himself?

423
00:34:45,684 --> 00:34:47,675
What's wrong with you?

424
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,579
I thought...

425
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:56,093
I thought I owed it to Jimmy to tell him.

426
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:57,751
Owed it to him?

427
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,890
Did you owe it to Rebecca?

428
00:35:01,066 --> 00:35:02,863
You tell her your theory?

429
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:08,563
That Chuck intentionally
set himself on fire?

430
00:35:10,642 --> 00:35:11,734
I guess not.

431
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:14,378
I guess you just
saved that one for Jimmy.

432
00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:16,207
Kim, I didn't do it to hurt Jimmy...

433
00:35:16,381 --> 00:35:19,441
- You did it to make yourself feel better.
- That's not what I was...

434
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:23,213
To make yourself feel better
by unloading your guilt.

435
00:35:23,388 --> 00:35:26,482
Who cares what it does to Jimmy
as long as Howard Hamlin is okay.

436
00:35:26,658 --> 00:35:29,752
- Kim, I don't think that's fair...
- Fair?

437
00:35:29,928 --> 00:35:31,657
Let's talk about fair.

438
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:35,231
Hey, let's let Jimmy dig around
the fire-damaged wreck...

439
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,834
where his brother died screaming.

440
00:35:38,003 --> 00:35:39,971
Let's let him pick up a keepsake or two.

441
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:44,438
That is so, so fair.
And did I hear you right?

442
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:48,010
You want him to serve on the board
of a scholarship committee?

443
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:50,807
A scholarship that Chuck
never in a million years...

444
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:54,281
would've given to Jimmy.
Never! It is just...

445
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:57,615
I mean... Oh, what's this too, Howard?
What's in this?

446
00:35:57,789 --> 00:36:00,815
One last screw you, little brother
from beyond the grave?

447
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:03,460
I'm really supposed to do this to him?

448
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:05,425
All right. Kim.

449
00:36:06,765 --> 00:36:08,824
What can I do to make it better?

450
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:12,863
Nothing.

451
00:36:14,139 --> 00:36:16,471
There is nothing you can do.

452
00:36:17,442 --> 00:36:19,433
Just stay away.

453
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:45,391
Hey.

454
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:48,403
I hope you're hungry.
I bought way too much food.

455
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:50,165
Yeah. I can always eat.

456
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:52,571
Counter or couch?

457
00:36:52,744 --> 00:36:54,712
- Couch is good.
- Couch it is.

458
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:59,746
If I remember correctly, in five minutes,
one of the classic movie channels...

459
00:36:59,918 --> 00:37:02,910
is showing White Heat
without interruption.

460
00:37:03,088 --> 00:37:06,080
The other is showing
Jaws 3 with commercials.

461
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:08,919
So a real Sophie's Choice.

462
00:37:09,094 --> 00:37:12,427
It is Jaws 3-D, to be exact.

463
00:37:13,765 --> 00:37:16,529
But Cagney wins this one.

464
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:19,261
All right.
Hey, I got us Thai iced teas...

465
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:23,237
unless you want me to pour you
something less non-alcoholic.

466
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:25,535
No, I'm good with that.

467
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:28,440
So how was the job search?

468
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:30,240
Pretty good.

469
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:32,212
I got a couple leads.

470
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:34,408
Actually, I got an offer.

471
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:36,213
- Really?
- Yeah...

472
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:39,948
but didn't feel quite right.

473
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:41,854
It was...

474
00:37:42,227 --> 00:37:44,195
It just wasn't a perfect fit.

475
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:48,628
But I think I might get a call back
on one or two of the others.

476
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,031
Wow, that's a pretty good first day.

477
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:54,967
You know, somebody's gonna
be lucky to get you.

478
00:37:57,542 --> 00:37:59,134
How was your day?

479
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:03,371
I just mostly stayed here,
trying to get organized.

480
00:38:03,548 --> 00:38:07,780
No pressure from Paige and Kevin,
but I gotta get back on the horse, right?

481
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:10,153
You are right.

482
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:13,484
And movie's about to start.

483
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:17,617
So where is the remote?

484
00:40:07,205 --> 00:40:10,402
I'm not available at the moment.
Leave a message.

485
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:13,703
Hey, it's me.
Listen, I got something for you.

486
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:15,505
It's a job.

487
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,411
I think you're really gonna like this.

488
00:40:19,951 --> 00:40:21,748
So call me.

489
00:40:47,312 --> 00:40:49,371
We're taking six tonight.

490
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:51,810
What?

491
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:54,543
Six keys. It's what the boss would want.

492
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,383
You're gonna back me up or what?

493
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:00,481
Yeah.

494
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:23,914
Where's the rest?

495
00:41:27,085 --> 00:41:29,178
I only see five.

496
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:32,620
That was a one-time only.

497
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:34,424
Not the way we see it.

498
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:36,526
That's the way it is.

499
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:42,092
Salamancas get six.

500
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:44,200
We're not leaving without six.

501
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:49,772
Your boss isn't giving orders.

502
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:51,875
He can barely even open his eyes.

503
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,869
I'm giving the orders.

504
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:58,649
Take the five or leave with nothing.

505
00:42:09,494 --> 00:42:11,359
Do you wanna go?

506
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,825
You heard him.

507
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:18,730
Six.

508
00:42:19,137 --> 00:42:21,071
Put it away.

509
00:42:22,807 --> 00:42:25,139
Do you really wanna do this?

510
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:03,009
Yeah, that's what I thought.

511
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:37,039
That's how you do it.
We had them pissing their pants.

512
00:44:13,184 --> 00:44:15,243
I know what you've done.

513
00:44:17,922 --> 00:44:20,152
The Salamancas...

514
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:22,292
they do not.

515
00:44:22,793 --> 00:44:24,852
Do you understand what I am saying?

516
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,431
Look at me.

517
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:42,007
From now on...

518
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:46,378
you are mine.
