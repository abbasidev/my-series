1
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,870
You wanted me to talk.

2
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,552
I talked.

3
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,680
Done.

4
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,598
- James McGill.
- James.

5
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,638
Hi, it's Robbie Finn from CC Mobile.

6
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,440
- Hi.
- Am I calling at a bad time?

7
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,795
No, it's fine.

8
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,310
Great. Good news.
If you're still interested...

9
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,518
we'd like to offer you
a position at our uptown branch.

10
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,313
- Oh, this is the cell phone store?
- You bet.

11
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,517
You made quite an impression
on Mr. Boyd.

12
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,792
He's talking about starting you off
as shift supervisor.

13
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,919
We can get your training done today,
if that works for you.

14
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,231
James? You still there?

15
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,070
I'm sorry, my plans have changed.

16
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,114
- I'm not gonna be able to take that job.
- Yeah?

17
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,999
- Sorry to hear that.
- Me too.

18
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,350
It's a real shame.

19
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,035
All right. Well,
have yourself a good day, James.

20
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,032
You too.

21
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,796
- You taking off?
- Yeah.

22
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,757
Hey, you want Thai for dinner?
I've got a hankering for that iced tea.

23
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,400
Yeah, that sounds good.

24
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,155
I should be back by 7.

25
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,039
Excellent.

26
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,114
What's up?

27
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,551
I was thinking...

28
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,589
that maybe you should
talk to someone.

29
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,600
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

30
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,638
I got a name.

31
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,313
He's not far from here.
I've heard good things.

32
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,277
Thought you'd give him a call.

33
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,678
It's a shrink?

34
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,515
It works for a lot of people.

35
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,915
Yeah. Okay.

36
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,991
Yeah. Well, thank you.

37
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,394
I just have to...

38
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,555
I have to check out my schedule and...

39
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:56,351
Oh, jeez.
I almost forgot to tell you.

40
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,840
I got a job.

41
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,710
- Really?
- Yep.

42
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,510
You're looking at Albuquerque's newest
mobile communications specialist.

43
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,754
I'm a shift supervisor even.
Be very impressed.

44
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,709
Cell phone sales.
I'm selling cell phones.

45
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,519
CC Mobile, I start today.

46
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,353
Jimmy, that...

47
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,554
- That is great.
- Yeah.

48
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,473
It's strictly gainful employment.

49
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,714
And then 10 months from now, poof,
I'm a lawyer again.

50
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,956
All right.

51
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,830
But you'll... Just give him a call
when you get a chance.

52
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,037
Of course. Absolutely.

53
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,556
Okay. Coffee's on.

54
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,270
Have a good first day.

55
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,040
You can count on it.

56
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,319
Mr. Finn, James McGill.

57
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,917
I've been thinking it over,
and I just can't pass up this opportunity.

58
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,760
If the position is still open?

59
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,759
- Hey, Marty.
- Morning, Kim.

60
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,594
- What's on for today?
- Well, let's see.

61
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,559
Papadoumian has settlement
conferences most of the morning.

62
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,918
Judge Clark has a pair
of corporate bankruptcies.

63
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,198
Munsinger looks like
criminal trespassing...

64
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,552
aggravated stalking
and some pleading down.

65
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,360
- Okay. Thanks.
- You got it.

66
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,989
And you'll have another 14 days
from when they file...

67
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,796
to tell me if you want to amend
your request for a pretrial conference...

68
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,556
or keep it the way it is.
I gather you're planning to amend, yes?

69
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,200
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Fine.

70
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:49,389
We'll reconvene in 30 days for a proper
pretrial conference, shall we?

71
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,995
I'll have an order out tomorrow.

72
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,914
Okay. Next.

73
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:02,399
CR2003114576,
State v. Scotty Blakey.

74
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,032
Ms. Wexler, do you have a matter
before the court today?

75
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,351
No, Your Honor. Just observing.

76
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,720
All right.

77
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,877
- Counsel.
- Good morning, Your Honor.

78
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,680
Crystal Eitzmann on behalf of the state.

79
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,716
It's your turn.

80
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,633
Oh, okay.
I'm Scotty Blakey, here for myself.

81
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,918
Mr. Blakey, you're here
because I called this case last week.

82
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,231
You didn't show up,
hence the bench warrant.

83
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,956
- Understood?
- Yes.

84
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,111
Your Honor, Mr. Blakey was given
a six-month suspended sentence...

85
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,237
along with the one-year provision.

86
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:46,555
There's no question this bench warrant
constitutes a violation of a generous deal.

87
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,279
I'm doing the community service.

88
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,040
Munsinger would like to see you
at the next recess.

89
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:55,274
The first place, the state was prepared
to charge this case as a felony...

90
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,753
and agreed to drop it to a misdemeanor
to avoid wasting time and resources.

91
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,679
In.

92
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,390
Oh, I don't wanna bother you
while you're eating.

93
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:13,520
Sit. Help me take my mind off
this eggplant and okra.

94
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,672
My wife insists, you know,
cholesterol, yadda, yadda.

95
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,475
Hurt your arm, huh?

96
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,199
Yes.

97
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,157
- Are you researching something?
- No, Your Honor.

98
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,317
Then you're working on
your procedure.

99
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,518
Just observing.

100
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,479
So Howard Hamlin's fine
with one of his associates...

101
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,077
sitting around my court all day,
whiling away the billable hours?

102
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,118
Actually, I left HHM.

103
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,715
- I'm a solo practitioner now.
- No kidding.

104
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,320
Field?

105
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,631
Mainly banking.

106
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,070
- How's business?
- Pretty good.

107
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,471
I'm outside counsel for Mesa Verde.

108
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,114
Mesa Verde.

109
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,760
You know, I heard about a case.
I think you might be the right person for it.

110
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,036
Interested?

111
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,959
Of course.

112
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,240
I can't share all the details just yet,
but I can give you broad strokes.

113
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,352
There's a young woman...

114
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,080
into her early 20s,
pregnant with her first child...

115
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,273
nearing the end of term.

116
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,193
Healthy as a horse.

117
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,350
She develops a complication.
She goes to the hospital for delivery...

118
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,793
and there's a mistake
with the anesthesia.

119
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,431
She aspirates vomitus
into her oxygen mask.

120
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,640
Stops breathing.

121
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,759
The baby's delivered fine.

122
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,435
But the young mother
suffers serious brain damage.

123
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,560
She's left comatose on a respirator.

124
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,440
The family is naturally devastated.

125
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,674
And they're broke, so they have no way
to pay for the young lady's care.

126
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,914
And to make matters worse,
the hospital refuses to take responsibility.

127
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,036
And they've hired one of the most
expensive firms in the state.

128
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,517
This is the plot of The Verdict.

129
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,319
Yes. Of course it is.

130
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,997
Because movies are the only place where
those once-in-a-lifetime cases exist.

131
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:25,871
You know what I got coming up next?
A janitor who threw his pee on his boss.

132
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:30,717
The one after that, she stabbed her
boyfriend over a grilled-cheese sandwich.

133
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,834
This is the real world, Ms. Wexler,
and you won't find...

134
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,435
any save-the-broken-lawyer cases in it.

135
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,078
Don't think you're first
to rediscover their love of the law...

136
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,273
by trolling my court. You're not.

137
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,954
The best thing you can do
is stick to Mesa Verde.

138
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,272
Make lots of money.
Give some to charity.

139
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,958
Having said that,
we've got perpetual PD overload.

140
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,395
So beware.

141
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,998
Next time I see you lurking in my court,
I'm gonna put you to work.

142
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,193
Understood.

143
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,800
Good luck to you.

144
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,834
Thank you.

145
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,959
Your Honor.

146
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,593
All rise.

147
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,117
Good afternoon. Please be seated.

148
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:30,157
Case CR2003114882,
State v. Lester Downes.

149
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,591
You wanted to discuss
the conflict of interest.

150
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,515
Yeah, before we get started,
I'll address defense's motion...

151
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,354
to disqualify opposing counsel.

152
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,120
Well, I read your brief very carefully,
but I'm not...

153
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,511
- Sorry I'm late.
- Hey.

154
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,440
- Paper?
- Thank you.

155
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,792
Twenty-two across is Esmeralda.

156
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,194
Bell ringer's love interest.

157
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,116
- It's The Hunchback.
- Quasimodo. Look at you.

158
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,512
- Hey, Anita.
- Hey, Fran.

159
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,160
- The usual for you?
- Yup.

160
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,356
Thanks.

161
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,796
- Thank you, Fran.
- You're welcome.

162
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:03,717
You know, a girlfriend of mine
is playing piano with her band tonight...

163
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,594
at The Launchpad.
They're pretty good.

164
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,234
You wanna go?

165
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,198
Tonight's group.

166
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,192
We could ditch.

167
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,712
I'd better go.
I told Stacey I'd be there.

168
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,719
Sure.

169
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,316
Maybe I could stop by after.

170
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,718
That'd be great.

171
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,911
You know, speaking of group...

172
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,834
I've been thinking
about reaching out to Henry.

173
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,914
I think he needs a friend.
Every time I see him, he seems worse.

174
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,713
Henry's fine.

175
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,156
- You talked to him?
- Don't need to.

176
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,152
Then how do you know?

177
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,309
Because that dead wife
he's always talking about never existed.

178
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,994
What are you talking about?

179
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,913
It's an act.

180
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,116
Why would you even say that?

181
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,670
The guy's story changes
every time he tells it.

182
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,433
Really?

183
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,200
No, I don't think so.

184
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,433
The romantic night at the Cubs game,
their first kiss?

185
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,795
- Yeah?
- It never happened.

186
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,280
You can't know that.

187
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,600
Wrigley Field didn't get lights until '88.

188
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,116
There were no night games
before then.

189
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,155
None of his details add up.

190
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,069
Well, maybe he just got the year wrong.

191
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,434
Why would anyone
make up a story like that?

192
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,273
Okay.

193
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,113
Here you go.

194
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,395
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

195
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,517
Thanks, Fran.

196
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,280
You know...

197
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,036
you have a very suspicious nature.

198
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,709
Watch him.

199
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,878
He's got a tell.

200
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,152
Like a bad poker player,
when he's lying...

201
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,437
he rubs his wrist.

202
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,473
Okay.

203
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,592
Wanna put your money
where your mouth is?

204
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,191
What, you gonna come
to group tonight?

205
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,512
Make it interesting.

206
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,999
All right.

207
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,597
Ten bucks says that
when he talks about Judy...

208
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,400
different story.

209
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,920
- All right. You're on.
- All right.

210
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,039
CC Mobile, this is Jimmy.

211
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,715
Hey-o. How's the first morning?

212
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,111
Good, Robbie.

213
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,596
But, yeah, actually, it's a little...
a little slow.

214
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,117
Yeah. That store's always been
a bit calmer. Just bring a book.

215
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,511
- So this is a normal weekday?
- Mostly.

216
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,798
But wait till inventory week.
There's a line out the door.

217
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,633
When's inventory week?

218
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,598
You just missed it.

219
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,513
Is there any chance...

220
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:09,196
you could move me to a store
with a little more traffic?

221
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,637
Let's see, the Gold Street store's
always hopping.

222
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,950
But looks like
the schedule's all full right now.

223
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,271
Let's give it a couple weeks,
then we'll see.

224
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,353
- Okay, no problem.
- If I can, I'll swing by later.

225
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,991
- Keep up the good work.
- See you then. Bye.

226
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,230
Yeah, that's it. I remember
the smoked windows.

227
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,837
That's the one that ran us off the road.

228
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:44,399
That place is like a fortress,
we're gonna need numbers.

229
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:50,031
I'll pull Domingo and Javier,
and their crews.

230
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,193
We'll round them up...

231
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,675
and hit them tonight.

232
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,475
Amigos.

233
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,636
Fucking Salamancas.

234
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,832
Give yourselves up, idiots!

235
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,678
It's the only way
you're coming out alive.

236
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,989
You're out of bullets, give up now!

237
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,800
We cleared out the Espinosas.

238
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,679
They're all done.

239
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,391
And the Salamanca brothers?

240
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,596
Marco took a hit...

241
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,120
but he'll pull through.

242
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,158
They went back south
until the heat dies down.

243
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,990
It's territory, isn't it?

244
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,551
The Salamancas wipe out
the Espinosas...

245
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,992
Espinosa territory is up for grabs.

246
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,352
Cartel can't give it to the Salamancas.

247
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,316
So I think they give it to you.

248
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,392
Get some rest.

249
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,277
You have more to do.

250
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,912
It's a service to the people.
It really is. It's a nonprofit.

251
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,677
And it's a perfect fit. I mean,
what with his degree in sociology and all.

252
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,840
I think he's really come a long way.
It...

253
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,198
He hasn't even talked about
getting a job until this week.

254
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,312
The place is called...

255
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,636
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

256
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,276
Willa, you hadn't quite finished.

257
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,956
It's called the North Fourth Art Center.

258
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,879
I hope he takes the job.

259
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,395
Well, thank you, Willa.

260
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,519
That all sounds really promising.

261
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,393
Anyone else?

262
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,113
Stacey.

263
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,473
Today I got up and I took a shower.

264
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,639
Kaylee woke up on her own,
and got herself ready for school.

265
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,359
It was just a regular morning.

266
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,677
I made french toast for breakfast...

267
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,151
and we talked about
the self-pasting toothbrush...

268
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,397
she's making for the science fair.

269
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,990
I took her to school and went to work.

270
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,951
And then I realized it.

271
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,358
I don't know why I noticed it
just then...

272
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:36,471
but I hadn't thought
about Matty all morning.

273
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,637
Not once.

274
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:46,796
When I was making french toast,
why didn't I remember that it's his favorite?

275
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,039
I think about Matty
every single time I make breakfast.

276
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,317
But not today.

277
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,990
And they weren't just minutes.

278
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:59,392
There were hours
that I didn't think about him.

279
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:04,876
And if I can go hours, then...
then why not a whole day?

280
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,997
Why not a whole week?

281
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,954
I mean, what if I lose
the sound of his voice?

282
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,119
What if I forget him completely?

283
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:17,998
I mean, I know I won't,
that's impossible, but...

284
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:23,397
I don't know. I just...
I don't know.

285
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,075
Thank you, Stacey.

286
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,596
You're not alone, truly.

287
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:34,632
I mean, it might be painful,
but if you ask me, I'd say it's progress.

288
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,593
I mean...

289
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,999
a lot of us in this room have felt
the same things you're talking about.

290
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,200
I know I have.

291
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,600
I keep trying to get there.

292
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:56,199
You know, to live in the here and now.

293
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:03,273
I know that's what Judy
would've wanted, but it's hard.

294
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,596
This guy at work,
I've been avoiding him...

295
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,031
for the last two weeks...

296
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,513
ever since he got back
from his vacation to Australia.

297
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,675
She always wanted to go to Sydney.

298
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,593
But money was tight.

299
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,949
Finally, we were gonna go
for our 25th.

300
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,670
And that's when
she got her test results.

301
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,840
God.

302
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,320
Mike, you have something
you wanna add?

303
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,319
You don't wanna hear
what I have to say.

304
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:43,075
- Well, we're ready if you are.
- Yeah?

305
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,439
This guy was never married.

306
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,719
- What are you talking about?
- Mike, you know the rules...

307
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,394
I know your rules.

308
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,712
He's been coming in here for months,
selling you a bill of goods...

309
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,271
getting you all misty-eyed
and loving every minute of it.

310
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,516
- Pop.
- Stop.

311
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,558
That's just not true.

312
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,234
Yeah? Okay.

313
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,912
So I'll go to the public library,
and I'll get the papers from 1997...

314
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,677
and I'll run a search on Judy DeVore,
beloved wife of Henry DeVore.

315
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,911
Tell me I'll find her obituary.

316
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,115
She wanted to go to Australia?

317
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,159
Last month, it was Cuba.

318
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,638
Come on, Henry.

319
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,076
Let's look at the papers.
See if the math works.

320
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,469
Come on. Mike.

321
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,230
She's not there, is she?

322
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,597
Go on, say it.

323
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,750
You have no shame.

324
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,880
Well.

325
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,913
He came to the right place,
didn't he?

326
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,795
He knew you wouldn't notice.

327
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,440
And you didn't.

328
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:15,072
All wrapped up in your sad, little stories,
feeding off each other's misery.

329
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,316
You wanted me to talk.

330
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,071
I talked.

331
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,033
Leave now.

332
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,399
I don't want you here.

333
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,314
Leave.

334
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,836
Answer me!

335
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,356
I don't want to play games.

336
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,196
I told you to get out of my house.

337
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,558
You must go. Now!

338
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,320
My God.

339
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,119
What have they done to you?

340
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,513
Papa.

341
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,996
Papa, no.

342
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,879
You need the hospital.

343
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,239
Papa. Please.

344
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,951
Don't call. Not anyone.

345
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,112
911, what's your emergency?

346
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,155
I won't be safe if you do.

347
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,320
Hello?

348
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,914
911, what's your emergency?

349
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,319
I'm okay.

350
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,479
Can I rest here a little?

351
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,439
This one?

352
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,394
- What about this one?
- No.

353
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,074
This one.

354
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,758
Sure thing. Hernandez and Sullivan,
they led the pack and load.

355
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,673
My top guys.

356
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,479
Okay.

357
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,512
What's that say?

358
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,074
It's not a guessing game.

359
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,637
Thirty-eight degrees.

360
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,552
It should be 35.

361
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,359
Must've come in set wrong.

362
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,830
Goes out set right.

363
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,439
The manifest doesn't say
anything about...

364
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,836
Yeah.

365
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,798
We'll fix that.

366
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,357
This okay with you?

367
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,551
- Are you talking about the strap?
- I am.

368
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,195
Might be a little frayed...

369
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,630
- but the rest of them are fine.
- And you know this how?

370
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:20,353
So we're pulling
all the E-track straps?

371
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,876
Is that a question?

372
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:28,431
- We'll pull them.
- Call for Ehrmantraut.

373
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,158
Ehrmantraut.

374
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,391
He wants to see you.

375
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,120
Yeah?

376
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,794
Tonight.

377
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,273
Hold on.

378
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,836
We're not done yet.

379
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,000
I'm a Fanta guy myself.

380
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,958
Yeah, well...

381
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,275
you can buy a truckload.

382
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,433
Here you go.

383
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,672
Hey, whoa, whoa.
This is more than we talked about.

384
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:41,954
Bavarian Boy made quite a splash
at the collectibles expo.

385
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,999
- Bidding war.
- Wow, great.

386
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,231
But we know
you could've kept most of this.

387
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,198
I would've never known the difference.

388
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,034
Yeah, well,
you could've left me high and dry.

389
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,676
I'm liking this Hummel thing.

390
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,396
Cash came fast and clean.

391
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,069
Got any more where that came from?

392
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,751
No, not really.

393
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,037
Oh, bummer.

394
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,752
We're gonna do this again.

395
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,230
- I'll find something.
- Sounds good.

396
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,632
When you do, call the vet.

397
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:22,234
- Yeah?
- Yeah. New job, new phone.

398
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,917
You never know who's listening.

399
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,956
You wanted to see me, here I am.

400
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:05,354
In order for our arrangement to continue,
there is a matter we need to discuss.

401
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,472
Okay.

402
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,110
Do you have something to tell me?

403
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,917
If you do...

404
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:20,073
you would be well-advised to do so.

405
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,877
Nacho Varga.

406
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,680
I wondered when
you were gonna get around to this.

407
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,596
You came to me.

408
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:33,309
You asked for a favor.

409
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,596
You looked me in the eye,
you shook my hand.

410
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,879
And all the while, you knew
Varga was moving against my interests.

411
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,317
I said I wouldn't kill Salamanca.

412
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,279
I never promised to be his bodyguard.

413
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,753
So...

414
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,192
what now?

415
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:01,912
If you're gonna make a move,
you better make it.

416
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:13,640
But they're not gonna, are they?

417
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:17,557
You brought me here
because you have an ask.

418
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:24,235
So why don't you stop running a game
on me and just tell me about the job?
