Yes! Stay with me. Stay with me.

All the way, Max.

Yes! That's it! That's it!

10
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:44,961
Hello, Lucas.

11
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:50,175
Yes. Max. Come on, Max. It's me.
I'm right here. I'm right here, Max.

12
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:58,767
Are you... Are you... Are you okay?
Do you... Do you hurt anywhere?

13
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:04,189
I can't feel... much.

14
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:07,859
Do you... Do you feel this?
Do you feel my hand?

15
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:09,819
A little.

16
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,530
Can... Can you... Can you see?

17
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:18,578
The lights are really...
are really bright.

18
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:20,580
Hey.

19
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,876
You haven't used your eyes, okay,
or your muscles for a long time.

20
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,754
Okay, your body's just weak,

21
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:30,840
but it just needs to readjust
and learn again.

22
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,636
You are going to be okay.

23
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,304
You're gonna be okay.

24
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,017
I knew you were there.

25
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,395
I always knew you were still there.

26
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:47,941
I saw you.

27
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,652
Waiting for me,

28
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:54,239

You bored of it yet?

Are you?

31
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:08,711
It turns out

32
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,881
that the whole time,

33
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,802
I didn't even need it.

34
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,806
I just needed you.

35
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:23,935

You're here. You're really here.

00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:52,589
I'm here.

42
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:54,507
Hey, welcome home, kid.

43
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,053
Took your sweet time, didn't you?

44
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,388
Screw you, Wheeler.

00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,353
Where am I?

46
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:08,688
Oh.

47
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:11,566
Yeah, that would be confusing. Um...

48
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,776
You were being hunted by the Demo-dogs,

49
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,362
and we were all seconds away
from becoming lunch

50
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,364
when Mrs. Wheeler came and...

51
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,284
did the laundry.

52
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,661
Holy shit! Mom!

53
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,289
Vecna.

54
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,542
He'll be angry.

55
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,086
He'll try and find me.

56
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,340
He'll know we escaped.

57
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:38,218
Where's Holly?

58
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:41,846

Jonathan.

62
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,783
Jonathan, stop.

63
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,536
What?

64
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,414
If we hurt ourselves,
we're really screwed.

65
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,209
Yeah, I guess you're right.

66
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:20,505
Oh, God.

67
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,802
Okay, so now what?

68
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,947
Anything else you wanna confess?

69
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:37,939
Stay back.

70
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,408
Sorry we're late.

71
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,205
You okay?

72
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:57,208
Yeah. Yeah, we're okay.

73
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:03,923
Thanks.

74
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,885
Was that weird? I'm sorry. That was weird.

75
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,430
I didn't... We just... We both thought...

76
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,682
-We were goners. Yeah, we did too.
-Yes.

77
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,392
Turns out that shield
generator of yours...

78
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,769
Isn't really a shield generator.
Yeah, we know.

79
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:20,022
Well, you'd think that would have been
good information to share.

80
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,732
Well, we tried.

81
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:22,900
Antenna snapped.

82
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,152
His fault.

83
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,904
Okay, so then what the hell did I shoot?

84
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,448
Exotic matter.

85
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,867
And we're supposed to know what that is?

86
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,703
It's all in here. Look. Check this out.

87
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,206
Dr. Brenner's notebook from '83.

88
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,041
This thing is a gold mine.

89
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:43,379
All his research into the gate,
how he created it, what it really is.

90
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,214
I'm still deciphering it, but...

91
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,175
Yeah, this shit will fry your brain.

92
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:50,386
Cliff notes, Holly isn't
on the other side of the wall.

93
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:54,640
Then where is she?

94
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,602
I don't know... exactly.

95
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:00,062
But wherever she is,
it's not the Upside Down.

96
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:25,046
When he took me,
he opened the fourth, final gate,

97
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,349
splitting Hawkins in two.

98
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,629
You can do this.

99
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,700
-What was that?
-What was what?

100
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,286
Holly.

101
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,085
Voyager Beta.

102
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,086
Any signal yet?

103
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,090
Negative, Voyager Alpha. Voyager Gamma?

104
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,009
A big, fat zero over here.

105
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,637
Your balloon experiment is a dud,
Snookums.

106
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,556
Let's just put the antenna on the van
and drive.

107
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,018
{\an8}As I've said, Voyager Gamma,
given the uneven terrain

108
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,727
{\an8}and forested nature of Hawkins,

109
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:29,105
a vehicle
is simply not the most expedient way

110
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,564
to pinpoint a telemetry tag.

111
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:33,359
{\an8}"Expedient"? We've been building
your goddamn balloon experiment

112
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:34,276
{\an8}for six hours!

113
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,030
{\an8}<i>Yes, but once we trilaterate
the three signals,</i>

114
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,699
I'll be able to pinpoint
Dustin's precise location.

115
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,493
You can't trilaterate shit
if we can't get a signal,

116
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:45,496
so let's just cut our losses now

117
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:48,582
before your star student winds up
dead in a ditch.

118
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,252
"Cut our losses..."

119
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,095
Fortune favors the bold.

120
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,308
{\an8}I've secured a location on Dustin.

121
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,269
Loose your balloons, Voyagers.

122
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:10,021
-Come again?
-Wait, hold on. What?

123
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:14,066
We need more height. Loose your balloons.

124
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:19,572
Negative 80!

125
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:21,866
Negative 44.

126
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:25,161
I take it back, Snookums,
you mad, mad genius!

127
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:28,164
Thank you, Voyager.

Hopper just radioed.

132
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,406
Max is safe. She got out.

133
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:07,077
Hey, this is good news.

134
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:10,873
None of this would have happened
if it weren't for you.

135
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,273
Everything's gonna be okay.

136
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,002
But for how long, Mom?

137
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,880
If Lucas is right, today is the day,

138
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,757
the day Vecna's gonna act.

139
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,718
I thought I had him. But the truth...

140
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,806
The truth is I never stood a chance.

141
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:31,727
And he knew it. He's always known it.

142
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:35,439
That's why, out of everyone in Hawkins,
he chose me.

143
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:43,072
Because he knew I was weak,
and he knew he could control me.

144
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,698
That is not true.

145
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,951
It is, Mom. It is.

146
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,744
I was his vessel.

147
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:53,749
A vessel to channel his powers, to spy,

148
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,585
<i>and... and to build.</i>

149
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:00,214
"To... To build"?

150
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,924
The tunnels.

151
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,162
They didn't spread from the gate
on their own.

152
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:10,933
<i>Every night, I jacked into the hive
and took control of the vines,</i>

153
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:16,188
<i>using them to tunnel,
infecting our world with the Upside Down.</i>

154
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:19,358
So many died because of me.

155
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,695
<i>And if I could do all of that,</i>

156
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:27,032
what could he do with 12 more like me?

157
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,159
You listen to me.

158
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:32,162
None of what happened is your fault.

159
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,080
Do you hear me?

160
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:36,000
And as for his big plan,

161
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:39,086
he's not gonna have 12 vessels,
or whatever the hell he calls them,

162
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:42,339
because he just lost Holly,
and she'll know where the others are.

163
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:46,468
Sweetheart, this is not over,
not by a long shot.

164
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:48,679
You're wrong.

165
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:51,348
You're wrong, Mom.

166
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,975
It's my fault.

167
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,393
No.

168
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:55,853
No, baby.

169
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,280
Go! Go!

170
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,169
<i>I couldn't see
where Holly was gonna wake up.</i>

171
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,880
But I figured

172
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,008
wherever Vecna was keeping her,

173
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,802
it had to be in the Upside Down.

174
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,221
So...

175
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:35,601
I told her to just go home.

176
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:37,645
Home? Home as in our home?

177
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:40,314
Meaning we have to get
back into the Upside Down.

178
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:42,942
-Where is the nearest rift to you?
-Off Cornwallis, I think.

179
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,527
About a mile and a half, give or take.

180
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,986
<i>Lucas, do you copy?</i>

181
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:46,946
-Oh, Robin.
-Yeah.

182
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:47,863
<i>Lucas!</i>

183
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,159
Erica,
I really can't talk right now.

184
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:54,036
Okay, so Vecna took out those soldiers,

185
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,080
so it should be a lot easier
to get into the MAC.

186
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:57,915
No. They're gonna have reinforcements
by now.

187
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:59,541
I can break through a plate.

188
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:04,213
Are you saying that Holly is trapped
under a steel plate?

189
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,423
Without context,
that might sound troubling,

190
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:10,260
but she's not pancaked under a giant hunk
of steel or anything. She's...

191
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,512
How do I talk about this?

192
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:15,057
-Well, there's this world under ours...
-Under the plates.

193
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,225
The Upside Down.

194
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,894
Yeah, and it's just like Hawkins,
only way suckier.

195
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,356
Guys, guys, guys.
Okay, you really won't believe this,

196
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:26,026
but Erica and Mr. Clarke came through.
They found Dustin and the others.

197
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:30,950
All right. Well, they're gonna be able
to find Holly a lot easier than we are.

198
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,953
We better hurry. We got company.

199
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:50,551
Hey, hey. Are you okay?

200
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,428
I'm fine, Michael. I'm fine.

201
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,889
No, with all due respect, Mrs. Wheeler,
you're not.

202
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:58,517
You could get an infection, hemorrhage,
God forbid, stop breathing.

203
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,855
If you think I'm gonna stay in bed
when my daughter needs me,

204
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:06,025
you're out of your goddamn mind. Let's go.

205
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,652
Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom. She's right.

206
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,279
It's okay. Keep going.

207
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,990
Hey, you saved us.

208
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,533
You saved us.

209
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:17,244
And by some miracle,
you're still here, okay?

210
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:20,414
But now, you need to trust me that
we can handle this the rest of the way.

211
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:23,542
There might be more of those things
out there.

212
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,335
They're called Demogorgons. I know.

213
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:29,798
There's so much that I need
to tell you about this Upside Down and El,

214
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,634
but right now, all you need to know is

215
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,887
that this group saved Will
when no one else could.

216
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,180
We did that.

217
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,391
And we're about to do the same thing
with Holly.

218
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:42,436
We're gonna bring her back to you, Mom.
I promise. Okay?

219
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:44,855
Yeah?

220
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,494
Mr. Clarke, thanks for the assist.

221
00:17:58,577 --> 00:17:59,661
Don't thank me yet.

222
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,289
We successfully trilaterated
Dustin's position here,

223
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:03,749
to precisely where I stand now.

224
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:06,043
But by the time we arrived, he was MIA.

225
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:08,565
Well, he wouldn't be precisely here.
He'd be under.

226
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:10,756
Sorry?

227
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,758
You didn't tell him?

228
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,760
-I...
-Told me what?

229
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,512
Holy shit.

230
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:18,847
Holy shit.

231
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,433
Hey, over here! Over here!

232
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,603
I got him! I got him!

233
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:26,480
I got Dustin!

234
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,946
-I don't hear anything.
-Patience.

235
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:37,825
<i>Is anyone there? Repeat, this is Dustin.</i>

236
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:40,244
Dustin, it's Mike.
Holly's escaped from Vecna,

237
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,371
and she's on her way to my house
in the Upside Down.

238
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:46,000
I need you to get there as fast as you can
and rendezvous with Holly. Do you copy?

239
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:49,462
<i>Holly's not at the house. We
found her. We found Holly. Repeat, we...</i>

240
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,963
Dustin, I'm losing you.

241
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:52,589
Dustin?

242
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,387
Am I going crazy, or did he just say
that he found Holly?

243
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:03,058
All right, let's hug this wall up here.

244
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,560
Why would she be at the lab?

245
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:07,271
Wherever she escaped from,
the lab must've been en route to my house.

246
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,732
She just happened to run into Dustin?
What are the odds?

247
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:10,649
Low as shit,

248
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,777
but I say it's about damn time
we had some luck.

249
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,694
Amen to that.

250
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:17,322
I'm sorry. I still don't follow.
Dustin is under those plates?

251
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,657
-Yes.
-But not pancaked.

252
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,617
Hang on. Hang on.

253
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:35,465
Yeah, we got cameras all over that rift.

254
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,761
I have an old spectrum analyzer
back at the club.

255
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,931
If I can just locate their RF signal,
I should be able to jam the transmission.

256
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,223
That's cool.

257
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,559
I think you're overthinking it.

258
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:49,105
You're telling me Alford
wouldn't have doubled that score?

259
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,856
Four from six from the field.

260
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:54,026
Reggie's gonna be something special,
you mark my words.

261
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:55,360
Walsh can do no...

262
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,116
You ain't seen nothing yet.

263
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,947
You coming, Snookums?

264
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,490
We're going in there?

265
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,201
We're going in there.

266
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,412
Steve!

267
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,206
Dustin!

268
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:50,540
Steve!

269
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,125
Nancy! Holly!

270
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,585
Jonathan!

271
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,677
Is this shit safe to breathe?

272
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,844
Unclear.

273
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:04,721
Okay.

274
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,808
Mike, any luck down there?

275
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:10,185
Mike? Mike!

276
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,437
Found him.

277
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,556
Jesus, it's good to see you guys.

278
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,410
Nancy?

279
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,037
Where is she?

280
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:30,872
Where's Holly?

281
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,297
-What was that?
-What was what?

282
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:40,924
Holly.

283
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,770
Nancy! Nancy!

284
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,564
-Holly! Holly!
-Nancy, help me!

285
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:58,191
-Nancy, help me! Help me down, please!
-Holly!

286
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,943
Nancy! Nancy, please!

287
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:00,902
Holly!

288
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,654
Nancy!

289
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:13,832
<i>It was like something had a hold
of her, but you couldn't see anything.</i>

290
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:17,252
It was him.

291
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,173
Vecna. It had to be.

292
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:23,884
<i>Mike?</i>

293
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,928
Is Holly okay, Mike? Mike, do you copy?

294
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,473
I repeat, is Holly okay?

295
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,897
Don't worry, Holly.

296
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:22,692
It will all be over soon.

297
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:28,532
It will all be over.

298
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:36,680
<i>It was some sort of demon,
a demon from that other world.</i>

299
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:38,959
He can control monsters,

300
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:41,586
move Humvees,

301
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,130
stop fire.

302
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,175
Bullets didn't touch him.

303
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,261
Hell, nothing could.

304
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:50,887
It wasn't a fight.

305
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:54,641
It was a damn massacre.

306
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,690
First we get
mutant dogs at the hospital.

307
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,275
Now a goddamn demon in the MAC?

308
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:05,569
You wanna tell me what else
is about to pop out of that hellhole,

309
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:07,029
or should we leave it a surprise?

310
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,948
I don't know if you've noticed,
but suddenly we're light on men.

311
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:11,700
Reinforcements are on the way.

312
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:14,870
Any additional requests,
talk to your unit commander.

313
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,581
How am I to know what to request
when I don't know what I'm fighting?

314
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:21,626
You're not fighting anything.
This is not a war. It is a search.

315
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,420
Something gets in your way, kill it.

316
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:26,548
But otherwise,
keep your focus on finding the girl.

317
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:29,134
Yeah, find the girl.
Christ, is that all you can say?

318
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:32,339
I mean, you got a pull string
under that jacket of yours or what?

319
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:36,475
Everything that has happened here
is because of that girl.

320
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:39,186
And if you had just done your job
and found her,

321
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:42,731
then I wouldn't have to repeat myself,
and we'd have those monsters in Moscow

322
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:45,942
where they'd be killing Soviets
instead of Americans.

323
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:48,236
The dead men, the children,

324
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,906
their blood is on your hands, Lieutenant,
not mine.

325
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:55,911
And unless you want to join them,
I would watch that goddamn tongue.

326
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:04,038
<i>Lt. Akers,
this is Bravo One. Do you copy?</i>

327
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:07,255
Yeah, what is it?

328
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,424
<i>We've got a rift breach at the old lab.</i>

329
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:11,301
On my way.

330
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:20,227
You okay?

331
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:21,937
Max.

332
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:32,989
So I leave you alone for a second,
and you turn into a sorcerer?

333
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:37,077
It was a little more than a second,
and I'm not really a sorcerer.

334
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,120
Mm, sure seemed like it to me.

335
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:42,916
Hey, you up for a tour?

336
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:48,255
Jimmy "Fast Hands" skipped town
before quarantine,

337
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,131
so we just sort of moved in here.

338
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:52,676
The basement is hidden
behind this bookshelf over there.

339
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,595
Not quite the Batcave,
but it's pretty sweet.

340
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:57,138
We kept the station going as cover.
Robin's our DJ.

341
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,849
-Rockin' Robin.
-Rockin' Robin, my bad.

342
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,393
And Steve's her sound man.

343
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:02,394
Check this out.

344
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:16,700
Hey...

345
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:18,952
We're gonna get Holly back.

346
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:21,454
She's all alone in there, Lucas.

347
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:25,041
Alone with that monster.

348
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:27,961
And I was so sure
that she could make it out.

349
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:29,588
And I was so stupid.

350
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,007
You had to try.

351
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,134
I should have stayed there.

352
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,305
And I should have kept her safe.

353
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:40,974
Then we'd all be screwed.

354
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:44,352
You've been in Vecna's mind.
You can help us beat him.

355
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,855
No. I can't.

356
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,819
I don't even know
where Vecna's keeping Holly.

357
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:54,487
Well, it's a good thing I do.

358
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:58,958
I know where she is,
but the real challenge is getting there.

359
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,453
I gotta show you guys something.

360
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:03,913
Okay.

361
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:09,044
So, this is Hawkins,
and this is the Upside Down.

362
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:12,464
We've always assumed the Upside Down
was another dimension opened by Brenner,

363
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:15,592
but it turns out it's actually a bridge.

364
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:18,303
More specifically,
an interdimensional bridge

365
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:19,929
<i>that rips through space-time.</i>

366
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:23,683
It is wildly unstable,
but held together by exotic matter,

367
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:27,062
which we found dead center
right above the lab.

368
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,438
<i>In theoretical physics,</i>

369
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:30,857
-they call this type of bridge a...
-Wormhole.

370
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,943
And this wormhole connects Hawkins
to here,

371
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:37,530
another world that I've coined the Abyss.

372
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:40,408
-Any particular reason?
-A realm of pure chaos and evil.

373
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,285
-I'm sorry?
-D&D.

374
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:43,870
-Jesus Christ.
-Wow.

375
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:47,832
I believe this Abyss is the true home
of the Demogorgons,

376
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,542
the vines, the Mind Flayer,

377
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:51,961
all the nasty shit we found
in the Upside Down.

378
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:54,047
It's where all those years ago
you banished Henry.

379
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,256
<i>He was lost for years,</i>

380
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,092
<i>and would've stayed lost
if it wasn't for Brenner.</i>

381
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:59,010
He had me find Henry.

382
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:02,555
And when you made remote contact
with the Abyss, the bridge formed.

383
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:05,100
Ever since, Henry and his army
of monsters have been using it

384
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,435
to cross right back into Hawkins.

385
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,771
We kicked Vecna's ass last year,

386
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:13,066
but he just fled across this bridge
back to the Abyss to lick his wounds.

387
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:14,025
What a pussy.

388
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:17,654
So all this time,
Vecna's been hiding in the sky?

389
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:19,906
Explains why every crawl led
to a dead end.

390
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:22,951
-And why I can't find him in the bath.
-And why Holly fell from the sky.

391
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,953
Yeah, but why is he taking kids up there?

392
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,538
For the same reason he took me.

393
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:30,583
The minds of children are weaker, right?
More easily molded and controlled.

394
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:34,254
So he channeled his thoughts and powers
through me to amplify his abilities,

395
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:35,881
and he's gonna do the same
with those kids.

396
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,632
Amplify his abilities?

397
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:39,175
To do what?

398
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,343
Move worlds.

399
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:45,724
Holly, she said Henry told the kids

400
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:49,561
that they would help him
draw the worlds together.

401
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:53,023
I didn't understand
what that meant at the time, but...

402
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:55,984
He wants to move the Abyss,
crash it into Hawkins.

403
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:56,943
No, not crash.

404
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:58,570
Merge.

405
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:02,323
Henry wasn't licking his wounds
in the Abyss. He was making rifts,

406
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,410
weakening the Abyss,
just like he weakened Hawkins.

407
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:07,204
So when the Abyss and Hawkins collide...

408
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:08,204
They become one.

409
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:09,664
He's remaking the world.

410
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,834
How long do we think this takes?
To move worlds?

411
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,670
Are we talking like...
Or is this gonna take some time?

412
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,298
We better hope we have some time.
Because if this is all correct,

413
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:21,093
we have to get 2,000 feet in the air,
find our way into the Abyss,

414
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:24,346
free Holly and the kids, and kill Vecna
all before our worlds merge.

415
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,889
And if my theory's right,

416
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,100
he's gonna move worlds tonight.

417
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,018
Have I mentioned
how much I hate your theory?

418
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,144
-Me too.
-Me three.

419
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:33,813
I hate all of this.

420
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:37,317
But at least now we know
what we're up against

421
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:39,194
and what we need to do.

422
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,030
We just need a plan.

423
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:04,803
I'm sorry.

424
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,639
I don't mean to pry. It's just...

425
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,307
everyone's so worried.

426
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,018
Is she gonna be okay?

427
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,484
But you've told her, right,

428
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:22,362
that this Max was just
a monster in disguise?

429
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:25,073
That it was tricking her, lying.

430
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,324
Of course.

431
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:29,536
I've tried everything,
but she won't listen.

432
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,706
We need her tonight, or we will fail.

433
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,376
What did this Max tell her?

434
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:39,754
Such awful, awful things.

435
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,090
She told her I kidnapped you.

436
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,842
-What?
-You rescued us.

437
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:44,926
I know.

438
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:48,012
That's not even the worst of it.

439
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:52,976
She told her I don't wanna save the world.
I wanna end it.

440
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:56,313
-How could she believe that?
-'Cause she's stupid as shit, that's how.

441
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,273
No, she's not stupid, Thomas.

442
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:02,944
This monster is incredibly powerful,
and she works for the Black Thing.

443
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,737
She has corrupted Holly's mind

444
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:07,699
and dragged her out of the light
and taken her into the dark.

445
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:11,160
Maybe we should just give up
and go home then.

446
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:13,246
-Go home?
-To be with our parents.

447
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:14,455
We would all die.

448
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,623
What's wrong with you?

449
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:16,958
Shut your trap, dipshit.

450
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,168
Please let's not turn on each other.

451
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:21,004
I know we're all upset.

452
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:22,672
But perhaps Derek is right.

453
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:27,468
Perhaps I have failed,
and the Black Thing has won.

454
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:29,971
No, we can't let it win.

455
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,390
Okay? We won't.

456
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:35,310
You don't know Holly like we do.

457
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:37,729
I've been her best friend
since kindergarten.

458
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:39,147
Debbie's her second-best friend.

459
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,441
-And she crushes hard on Josh.
-No, she doesn't.

460
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:42,692
-She does.
-Totally.

461
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:46,821
My point is, maybe if we all try
and talk to her, we can fix her.

462
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:49,949
We can bring her back to the light.

463
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,911
Mary's right. We can do it.

464
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:53,995
Back to the light.

465
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,413
Back to the light.

466
00:31:55,496 --> 00:32:01,210
Back to the light. Back to the light.
Back to the light. Back to the light.

467
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:07,675
Back to the light. Back to the light.
Back to the light. Back to the light.

468
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:12,096
Back to the light.
Back to the light. Back to the light.

469
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:18,102
As for the security cameras,
trench plate...

470
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,271
Not a bolt cutter.

471
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:22,231
Yeah, you could safely say that, sir.

472
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:30,281
She's getting reckless.

473
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,367
Sloppy.

474
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:34,452
Could be one of those damn monsters.

475
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:37,080
A monster who breaks padlocks and cameras?

476
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:38,665
I don't think so.

477
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:42,669
It's her.

478
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,257
Rally the rest of the team.
Tell them to lock and load.

479
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,466
We're going in.

480
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,642
At the base, in the Upside Down,
there's a chopper ready for the taking.

481
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,731
We fly up to the Abyss,
kill the freak, rescue the kids,

482
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:05,817
fly back down.

483
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,652
Who do you expect to fly this thing?

484
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:10,030
-It's a helicopter. They've got pilots.
-Right.

485
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:12,282
-We force one to fly.
-Another kidnapping plot. Love it.

486
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:14,534
How is this pilot gonna fly a chopper
into the rift?

487
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:17,036
What do you mean? We just fly through it.

488
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,162
-What?
-Idiot.

489
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,414
Just fly through it?

490
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:23,084
These rotors are like 40 feet wide.
It's too big. It's not gonna fit.

491
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:25,503
Steve hears that all the time
and goes in anyway. Don't you?

492
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:28,006
-What the hell is wrong with you?
-It's funny.

493
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:29,132
Everybody shut up.

494
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:33,553
Look, if somebody else has some magic bean
that I don't know about, I'm all ears.

495
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:36,889
If not, it's a risk that we gotta take.
We fly, or we die.

496
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,850
-Fly or die.
-Well, then I guess we die.

497
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:41,769
We're not gonna die
if we commit to a plan.

498
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,813
Can we weigh out
a few more options before...

499
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:45,857
Yes. We die, I guess.

500
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,985
-You said we have to get up 2,000 feet...
-Don't take that shit, Jim.

501
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:50,862
-You're not listening to each other.
-You guys!

502
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:52,116
How are you gonna do it?

503
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:54,073
"Magic bean..."

504
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:55,950
Can we get back on track?

505
00:33:56,034 --> 00:34:00,079
Let's not even try anything?

506
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,831
We don't need a magic bean to climb.

507
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:03,249
-...an airplane!
-I'm not...

508
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:04,709
We don't need a magic bean!

509
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:10,173
Sorry. Just... We
don't... We don't need it.

510
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,091
A magic bean.

511
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:14,469
We got a beanstalk right here.

512
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:26,481
Okay, this flashlight is
the Squawk radio tower, and this Slinky...

513
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,108
is the bridge.

514
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,820
We'll never reach the Abyss
from the tower, right?

515
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:35,031
But Max said Vecna is drawing
our worlds together.

516
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:37,200
So, we let him.

517
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:39,869
And we wait and wait

518
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:43,539
as he draws it closer and closer.
When it's close enough,

519
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:45,709
and the tower is poking
through one of the rifts,

520
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,376
bam! El makes her move,

521
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,046
she does her meditation thingy,
enters Vecna's sick mind

522
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:51,005
and ambushes him.

523
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,215
In your face, dickhead.

524
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:55,225
And then, stopping the spell,
halting the worlds from moving.

525
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:59,013
Wham, voilà!
We've got a beanstalk. It's perfect.

526
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:02,016
All we gotta do
is climb up it into the Abyss.

527
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,977
-I like it.
-It's not totally insane.

528
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:07,063
-Thank you.
-But there's a problem, a big one.

529
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:10,817
I can't reach inside Vecna's mind.
He's too far away.

530
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:14,529
Can't you just try? I don't know, load up
on some of your junk food or something?

531
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,197
Or better...

532
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:17,824
We get you close.

533
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:22,370
The Upside Down lab is under his lair,
and it's still frozen in time,

534
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:25,331
which means everything should be there
from Brenner's experiments, including...

535
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:26,666
The bath.

536
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:30,294
If you do make it into his mind,
I can walk you through it,

537
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,796
guide you.

538
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:33,590
I know his sick mind inside and out.

539
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,091
I should be there too.

540
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:38,970
This plan hinges on stopping Henry,
and right now, Jane is fighting him alone.

541
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:41,681
It doesn't need to be that way.

542
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:44,142
I can follow her into his mind.

543
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,938
We can end our brother, together.

544
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:50,606
Okay, yeah, I dig it.

545
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,910
Sisters kill their brother.
We rescue the kiddos, come home heroes.

546
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:57,614
And if Lucas is right, we don't have
a lot of time, so we have to move fast.

547
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:58,698
One final thing.

548
00:35:58,781 --> 00:35:59,866
Cherry on top.

549
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:04,871
On the way out,
we drop a bomb near the exotic matter.

550
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:08,791
Set a timer, escape the Upside Down.

551
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,753
The bridge collapses, and with it,

552
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:18,301
the Abyss, the Demos,
the Mind Flayer, all of it, gone.

553
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:20,970
Game. Set. Match.

554
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:29,312
Holly! Holly!

555
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:32,690
Hey. It's okay. You're safe.

556
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,651
You're safe now. You're with us. Okay?

557
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,198
Welcome back, Holly.

558
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,699
Welcome.

559
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,118
Where is he?

560
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,536
Mr. Whatsit?

561
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:47,288
Downstairs.

562
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,497
He's worried about you.

563
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:49,624
So worried.

564
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:52,585
No, no, no, no, no.
Mary, you need to listen.

565
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:55,797
Mr. Whatsit, he's not who he says he is.
He didn't really save us.

566
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,298
-He...
-He's kidnapped us?

567
00:36:57,798 --> 00:37:01,094
He's trying to destroy the world?
Holly, Mr. Whatsit has told us everything.

568
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:04,055
Those are lies. Evil, nasty lies!

569
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:07,260
-No, they're not! They're not...
-That other girl you met, Max.

570
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:08,601
She's not a human.

571
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:09,644
She's a monster.

572
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:10,853
She twisted your mind.

573
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,647
That's not true.

574
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:14,482
Max is a friend,

575
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,025
and she's... she's helping us.

576
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:19,695
She's helping us get back home,
back to our families.

577
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:21,405
We're all trapped.

578
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,532
Trapped in Mr. Whatsit's mind.

579
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:26,285
Everything you see, none of it is real!

580
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:28,347
Come on, you have to believe me.

581
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:29,914
Please.

582
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:34,961
You have to believe me.
You have to believe me.

583
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:36,128
You gotta believe me.

584
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:40,132
Derek.

585
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,094
Derek, tell them.

586
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,722
Tell them. Tell them!

587
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,982
They're right, Holly.

588
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:57,608
Max lied to us.

589
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:09,370
I don't... understand.

590
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:12,123
Everything she showed me just...

591
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:16,002
seemed so real.

592
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:20,673
I knew not to go into the woods.

593
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:24,593
But I... I went there anyway, and...

594
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,638
And I just... I just feel so...

595
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,268
so stupid.

596
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:35,855
-You're not stupid, Holly.
-None of this is your fault.

597
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:36,897
Holly.

598
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:41,944
You know, the important thing is that
you're here. You're here just in ti...

599
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:44,238
Holly, stop it!

600
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:50,786
Bitch! Get her!

601
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:54,165
Get her!

602
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:49,512
Well, I was hoping for a slightly
more delicate landing, but...

603
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:51,972
I suppose that'll do.

604
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:55,434
You're welcome.

605
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:01,691
{\an8}Of all the people she had
to go with, it had to be her.

606
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:04,735
El trusts her.
Maybe we should too.

607
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:08,239
No, she's up to something.
I'm sure of it. I just...

608
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,117
El's not gonna listen to me.

609
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,577
What happened to the two of you
down there?

610
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,238
She thinks I don't believe in her.

611
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,584
-Which isn't true.
-No, of course not.

612
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,336
Well, have you told her that?

613
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:24,839
She thinks she's invincible,

614
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,882
and that's not the case.

615
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:29,468
Yeah, that's not what I asked.

616
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:32,805
I can work on repairing things between us
when I get on the other side of this,

617
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:36,308
but right now, I need to make sure
she gets out of this alive.

618
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:40,312
That Kali makes one false move,
I swear to God, I'm gonna kill her.

619
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,607
I'm gonna kill her. I will not hesitate.

620
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:45,470
Anything happens to El in that tank,
I am pulling her out.

621
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:48,195
I can't lose her, Joyce.

622
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,783
I can't.

623
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,957
One last crawl.

624
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:03,294
One last crawl.

625
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:20,019
It gives me a headache
trying to understand all this.

626
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:26,734
But I think I got a C-in physics,
so I'll trust the nerds.

627
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:30,988
Do you think it'll work? The plan?

628
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:33,324
I mean, it has to, right?

629
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,827
I just wish I wasn't stuck here.

630
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:38,746
I feel useless.

631
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:42,083
El and Kali are gonna need you
in the mind. I'm the one who's useless.

632
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,293
You can still go there, to the Abyss.

633
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:46,086
It's too risky.

634
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:49,507
I'd be at the heart of the hive mind,
and I don't know what would happen.

635
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:53,219
Last time I got too close, he used me
to spy, and it almost got you killed, Max.

636
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:55,513
You also saved my life, remember?

637
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:59,350
Plus, I've been almost killed plenty
of times at the hands of this asshole,

638
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:01,477
so I'm kind of used to it at this point.

639
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:05,940
How did you survive in there,
this whole time in Henry's mind?

640
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,608
Honestly, luck.

641
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:10,694
I found this cave.

642
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,614
It was this old memory of his,

643
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:16,158
and he was terrified of it.

644
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:18,285
He wouldn't go in.

645
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:20,913
Scared the living shit out of him.

646
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:23,832
Underneath all those scars,
he's still human.

647
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:28,754
A psychopath
with a serious god complex, but...

648
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:31,298
human.

649
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:35,219
I guess
we're all scared of something, right?

650
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:47,815
Okay, Wheeler, how's it going
with your contraption?

651
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:52,903
{\an8}Okay, so just imagine that this bike bell
is the bomb's remote trigger, okay?

652
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:56,156
{\an8}So when this wire touches
this warrior here, kaboom.

653
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,324
{\an8}Genius.

654
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:00,828
{\an8}One thing is, I don't know
if we can blow up the Upside Down

655
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,830
{\an8}to the dulcet tones
of the Butthole Surfers.

656
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:04,999
I built the bomb.
I should be able to pick the record.

657
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,292
You <i>can</i> pick the record.

658
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:09,003
You just have to follow one simple rule,
which is pick a good record.

659
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,046
This is a great record!

660
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:13,090
As far as save-the-world soundtracks goes,
this one's lacking.

661
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:14,217
What would you pick?

662
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,677
The Replacements.
I can't not think of better records.

663
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,887
Okay, enough, Lester Bangs, okay?

664
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:22,308
Hey. Hey!

665
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:24,185
Have you handled one of these before?

666
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:30,399
Not exactly, but, you know, BB guns, air
rifles... ...<i>Duck Hunt.</i>

667
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:32,026
<i>Duck Hunt.</i>

668
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:33,475
He is remarkably good at it.

669
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:37,156
But I have a better idea.

670
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:38,824
Come on.

671
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:50,294
These babies are deadlier than they look.

672
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:54,590
You sure?

673
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:55,841
Mm.

674
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:00,179
-Hey, Dustin?
-Yeah?

675
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:03,515
Hey, about, uh, some of the stuff
that I said earlier. I just...

676
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,893
-It's fine. It's okay.
-No, just...

677
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,103
It's not okay.

678
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:12,024
Eddie...

679
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:15,152
He saved your life.

680
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,155
Our lives.

681
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:22,910
And I know what he meant to you.
I can't even imagine how hard it's been.

682
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:24,787
But instead of...

683
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,707
just being there for you, I just...

684
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:34,046
Well, I got angry about it. I guess...

685
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,300
I got angry because

686
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,470
things were different.

687
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:45,057
Because...

688
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:48,477
I really missed you.

689
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:54,316
I missed my best friend.

690
00:44:57,861 --> 00:44:59,738
Yeah, I missed my best friend too.

691
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:16,464
For the record, a Rubik's Cube
isn't even a good measure of intelligence.

692
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:21,636
And your beanstalk plan, seriously,
only a genius could've come up with that.

693
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:22,761
Yeah, well...

694
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:25,055
I learned from the best.

695
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:26,557
That's true.

696
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,475
Silver lining.

697
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,519
If it fails, we both go down.

698
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:33,147
You die, I die.

699
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:37,901
You die, I die.

700
00:45:56,044 --> 00:46:02,718
Gate opening in five, four, three, two...

701
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:06,847
Open sesame.

702
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:09,850
Gotcha!

703
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:14,897
We've secured the gate signal.
Repeat. Gate signal is secure.

704
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:17,900
Tell Snookums his timing is mwah!

705
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:20,027
Because Santa's sleigh...

706
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:23,947
...is almost ready.

707
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:27,284
Piece of shit!

708
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:31,079
Oh God! Oh God!

709
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:34,374
Why?! Why?!
Why do you gotta do this right now?

710
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:36,001
What? You don't like me? Huh?

711
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:38,212
It's not me! I'm not the one!
I'm not the one who...

712
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:39,463
Hi, sister.

713
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:41,715
Hi.

714
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:44,051
Have you ever done this before?

715
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:45,719
Shared your mind like this?

716
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,097
Have you?

717
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:52,147
With my other psychic friends
all the time.

718
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:54,978
I'm glad I'm here.

719
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:56,355
Me too.

720
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:58,023
Even after yesterday?

721
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,777
Have you thought about it?

722
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:03,695
What it all means?

723
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:10,619
I was thinking when we blow up the bridge,
we'll blow up Dr. Kay's lab.

724
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:12,955
We'll end her experiment.

725
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:14,457
Kay will simply make a new lab.

726
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:15,624
So we kill her.

727
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:18,502
She replaced Papa.
Another will replace her.

728
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:20,713
We can go away somewhere.
We can hide from them.

729
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:23,090
Oh, like somewhere
with at least one waterfall?

730
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:26,593
It's a fantasy, Jane.

731
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:29,429
If you flee with Mike,
maybe you're safe for a while.

732
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,598
But when they find you, and they will,

733
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:35,310
they will kill Mike,
just as they killed my friends.

734
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:37,646
Then they will take you,
and with your blood,

735
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:40,983
they will create more children,
children who will suffer as we have.

736
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:45,696
And with these children,
they will open up more gates, more worlds.

737
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:46,989
Don't you see, Jane?

738
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,157
It's a cycle.

739
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:52,995
A terrible, vicious cycle.

740
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:55,372
But we can stop it.

741
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,041
Tonight.

742
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:07,801
How?

743
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:10,262
After we kill our brother,

744
00:48:10,345 --> 00:48:12,180
after the children are rescued,

745
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:14,224
we don't leave with the others.

746
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:15,851
We stay on the bridge.

747
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:18,228
When the Upside Down vanishes...

748
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:22,858
so will we.

749
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,945
It is the only way, Jane.

750
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:29,656
The only way.

751
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:36,038
You ladies done meditating?

752
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:39,207
'Cause Santa's sleigh is ready to fly!

753
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:06,944
Mom?

754
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:09,905
Um...

755
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:17,120
Earlier today when you asked me
what happened in Vecna's mind,

756
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:19,456
I didn't tell you everything.

757
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:24,711
When Vecna attacks,

758
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:29,675
he weakens you
by turning your own mind against you,

759
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:33,512
by bringing out everything inside you
that hurts.

760
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:39,601
So I fought back
by focusing on happy memories,

761
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:42,688
memories from when I was a kid,

762
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:44,564
and when I wasn't scared,

763
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:47,234
and when I felt most happy.

764
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,946
<i>That's how I took control in the MAC-Z</i>

765
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:53,031
and how I killed those Demos.

766
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:55,701
And I thought the same would work
on Vecna too.

767
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:57,452
But he found a way past.

768
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:01,957
And he showed me things, Mom.

769
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:07,546
He showed me the most awful things.

770
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:09,006
No, listen.

771
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:13,260
Whatever he showed you, it's not real.
He plays tricks. He lies.

772
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:15,429
No, he doesn't.

773
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,140
What he showed me...

774
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:21,768
it didn't come from him.

775
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:24,521
It came from me.

776
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:28,483
He sees everything, Mom.

777
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:31,778
He sees my thoughts.

778
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:34,239
He sees my memories.

779
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:39,703
And he sees my secrets.

780
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:45,792
But Max, she told me he's also afraid,
which proves I can beat him.

781
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:49,254
But for me to do that,

782
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:51,965
you need to know...

783
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,097
I think you need to know the truth.

784
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:03,685
Oh. Uh...

785
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:05,771
Sorry. We just heard from Hop.

786
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:08,607
He's 15 minutes out.
So we should probably leave in five.

787
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:11,068
Is everything okay?

788
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:12,663
Yeah, we'll be out in a minute.

789
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:15,614
Wait.

790
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:18,784
I think you need to hear this too.

791
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:21,328
Everyone does.

792
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:30,420
I...

793
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:35,926
I... I haven't told any of you this

794
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:37,719
because...

795
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:44,684
Because I... I don't... I don't want you
to see me differently.

796
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:46,561
But the truth is...

797
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:51,316
The... The truth is I am.

798
00:51:51,399 --> 00:51:52,609
I am different.

799
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:54,694
I just...

800
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:59,241
I just pretended like I wasn't
because... because I didn't want to be.

801
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:04,287
I wanted to be like everyone else.
I wanted to be like my friends and...

802
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:06,665
And I am like you.

803
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:10,001
I'm like you in... in almost every way.

804
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:12,337
We... We like playing
D&D late into the night.

805
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:14,882
And we like that old-person smell
in Mike's basement.

806
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:19,177
And we... we like biking to Melvald's
for malted milkshakes.

807
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:22,013
And we like getting lost in the woods,

808
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:25,059
and getting lost in Family Video
and arguing about what to rent

809
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:27,853
and settling on <i>Holy Grail</i>
for the millionth time.

810
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:31,523
And... And we like Milk Duds
in our popcorn with extra butter.

811
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:34,860
And we like drinking Coke with Pop Rocks.

812
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:37,821
And we like bike races and trading comics

813
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:41,700
and NASA and Steve Martin
and Lucky Charms and...

814
00:52:41,783 --> 00:52:43,285
Literally all the same things.

815
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:47,581
I just... I just... I... I just...

816
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:48,707
I...

817
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:51,710
I...

818
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:53,461
I...

819
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:55,380
I don't like girls.

820
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:09,603
I mean...

821
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:15,066
I mean I do. Just...
Just not like you guys do.

822
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:19,738
And I, uh, I had this...
this crush on someone,

823
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:22,908
even though I know...
I know they're not like me.

824
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:27,537
But... But then I realized
he's just my Tammy.

825
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:30,457
And by Tammy,
I mean it was never about him.

826
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,083
It was... It was about me.

827
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:35,212
And I thought
I was finally okay with myself,

828
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:37,589
but... but then today...

829
00:53:37,672 --> 00:53:40,800
Today Vecna showed me what would happen
if I did this,

830
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:43,762
if I told you guys the truth.

831
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:47,474
He showed me a future, and in this future,

832
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:51,061
some of you are just...
are just worried for me.

833
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:53,271
Worried that things will be harder for me.

834
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:56,566
And it just makes me feel like
something's wrong with me.

835
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,193
So I... So I push you away.

836
00:53:58,276 --> 00:54:01,488
And for the rest of us,
we just drift apart more

837
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:05,283
and more and more
and more and more until I'm alone.

838
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:08,954
And I know none of that has happened,
and Vecna can't see into the future.

839
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:11,831
But he can see into our minds,
and he knows things.

840
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:16,503
And it just felt so real. It felt so real.

841
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:17,712
Will.

842
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:19,631
You gotta listen to me.

843
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:22,092
That will never ever happen.

844
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:24,219
You'll never lose me.

845
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:25,845
Ever.

846
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:28,598
Okay. Okay.

847
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:30,850
And you'll never lose me.

848
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:38,233
Or me.

849
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,235
Or me.

850
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:42,195
Or me.

851
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:43,154
Or me.

852
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:44,864
Or me.

853
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:03,550
Guess you didn't need truth serum, huh?

854
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:08,305
Sorry. This sucks,
but you're gonna have to hug me.

855
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:10,640
Oh, Max.

856
00:55:14,352 --> 00:55:17,522
Just imagine
I'm hugging you really tight, okay?

857
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:18,690
Okay.

858
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:28,575
El.

859
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,536
I know you're strong enough
to defeat Vecna.

860
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:34,205
But he can retreat to the physical world,

861
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:37,292
and we need to be ready
to fight him there too.

862
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:41,921
We have bullets and fire,
but none of that helped those soldiers.

863
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:45,508
I need to be there.

864
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:49,304
And I'm ready.

865
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:52,724
I'm ready to show him
I'm not afraid anymore.

866
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:13,078
<i>That's a confirmation.
Anderson's on that patrol.</i>

867
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:18,333
<i>Solid copy, Bravo One.
Maintain overwatch. Over.</i>

868
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:27,592
Hey, McConnell.

869
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:29,969
We got a delivery tonight
I don't know about?

870
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:31,513
<i>That's a negative, private.</i>

871
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:33,598
The hell are you doing, buddy?

872
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:38,686
Showtime, Snookums!

873
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:40,313
<i>Mellon</i>.

874
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:46,236
Oh, shit!

875
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:49,239
Pardon me!

876
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:51,825
First gate cleared.

877
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:55,120
Two hostiles, towers,
ten and eleven o'clock.

878
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:17,142
Now comes the fun part.

879
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:49,299
-Come on! Come on!
-Come on! Come on!

880
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:51,843
Go! Go! Drive!

881
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:08,735
Whoo-hey!

882
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:10,487
Yeah!

883
00:58:12,947 --> 00:58:14,699
Jesus Christ.

884
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:17,744
Everybody all right? Everybody okay?

885
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:19,973
-Yeah.
-You all right? Everybody all right?

886
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:22,874
Hey, nice shooting back there.

887
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:24,375
You too.

888
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:29,638
I kind of thought that
that was supposed to be the easy part.

889
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,382
It was.

890
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:33,009
You ready?

891
00:58:35,136 --> 00:58:36,012
Ready.

892
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:52,088
It's time.
