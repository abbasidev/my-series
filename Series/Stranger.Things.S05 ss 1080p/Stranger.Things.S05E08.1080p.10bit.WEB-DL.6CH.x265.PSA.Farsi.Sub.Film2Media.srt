1
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:52,928
I swear to God, I didn't touch shit!

2
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:55,681
So the gate just opened up all on its own,
like magic?

3
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,724
It must've been some kind of malfunction.

4
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:59,101
Let me get this straight.

5
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:02,688
There was a malfunction
at the exact moment that truck showed up?

6
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,481
You expect me to believe that, soldier?

7
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,233
I swear. I don't know what happened.

8
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,651
What if it <i>was</i> a malfunction?

9
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,697
Only one not caused by us.

10
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,757
All right,
lab rats, let's scurry up.

11
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,636
An entire dimension's about
to come crashing down on our heads.

12
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:38,431
Hey.

13
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:40,683
Is everything okay?

14
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:42,686
Listen,

15
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:46,023
I know this plan is totally mad,
and a million things have to go right,

16
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,859
and a million things could
and probably will go wrong.

17
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:52,112
But we can do this. I know it.

18
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:56,074
One last fight,
and this whole nightmare, it'll be over.

19
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,243
It'll finally be over.

20
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,320
Well, hello there.

21
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,530
MAC, this is Wolfpack. Do you copy...

22
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,908
-What do you think you're doing?
-Alerting the Doc.

23
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,910
That bitch has a God complex.

24
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,870
All she'll do is slow us down.

25
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:43,288
No.

26
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,999
We're bagging this freak ourselves.

27
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:56,463
-Do you think they're all right?
-The truck is faster than a Humvee.

28
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:59,174
Let's be conservative,
say five miles faster.

29
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,718
They had a six minute,
20 second head start,

30
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,304
giving them an additional lead
of about half a mile.

31
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,723
So they're fine for now,

32
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,684
but the real shit hasn't started yet.

33
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,603
Erica, language, please.

34
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:15,940
This isn't Intro to Science.
This situation demands cussing.

35
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,864
-So, how's it feel?
-What?

36
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:26,451
Helping to save the world and all that.

37
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,995
It feels pretty swell.

38
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:31,748
Pretty goddamn swell.

39
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:45,762
Go! Go! Go!

40
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,222
Breach! Move, move, move!

41
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,253
Hey, Robin, yeah.

42
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,338
Can you please tell me that
that was you guys

43
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:22,590
and not more of those, like, mutant Cujos?

44
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,969
It's us, and it's too early
to be stressed, Vic. Save it for later.

45
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:29,721
Yeah, no, copy that, yeah. No.
Bottling... Bottling emotions.

46
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:39,565
No sign of an evil moving planet.

47
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:43,111
Well, that's good.
'Cause this is gonna take some time.

48
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,196
All right, we should split up.

49
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,240
Use both ladders.

50
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,868
Don't rush. Pace yourselves.

51
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:53,747
There are platforms along the way,
so use them to rest.

52
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,914
All right.

53
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,875
Let's do this.

54
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,130
You okay?

55
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,600
Don't be frightened.

56
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,268
These are all friends.

57
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,562
They're just here to watch.

58
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,814
Don't focus on them.

59
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:03,858
<i>Yes, Papa.</i>

60
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:20,958
And let there be light.

61
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,590
All right, nice work, Bald Eagle.

62
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,259
Now get up to the roof.

63
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,302
Careful with that C-4.

64
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,227
I don't wanna blow the Upside Down
with us in it.

65
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,599
Oh, I was planning on carelessness.

66
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,602
But you're right, Jim.
Caution here would be wise.

67
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,276
All right.

68
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:49,946
Now remember,

69
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:53,908
two slow knocks means...

70
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:57,245
-The Abyss started to move.
-That's right.

71
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:01,249
And you and your sister get in position,
but you wait. You do not attack.

72
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:04,377
The second I get confirmation
that planet's close enough to the tower,

73
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,380
then I'm gonna give you three fast knocks.

74
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:09,632
Then we strike. We kill Henry.

75
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:15,513
And we, uh, pray to God Dustin's right,
and that planet stops moving.

76
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,141
What could possibly go wrong, right?

77
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,396
If something does go wrong,

78
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:26,816
I need you to promise me
you won't pull me out.

79
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,694
Not until I'm sure he's dead.

80
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,282
Okay, well,

81
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,660
then I'm gonna need a promise
from you too.

82
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,997
If by some miracle this plan works,
we're getting the hell out of here.

83
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,585
Doc Kay and her plans,
that's a problem for another day.

84
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:48,421
Deal?

85
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:03,978
Let's end this, kid.

86
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,094
-You want some?
-Yeah.

87
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,774
Hey, um...

88
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,403
What you said earlier at the Squawk...

89
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:37,780
I'm sorry.

90
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:41,451
I mean, not sorry about what you said.
That came out wrong.

91
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,661
Or not came out wrong. Jesus Christ.

92
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:44,995
It's okay.

93
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,290
No, it's... it's not.

94
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,710
I should have been there for you,
and I wasn't.

95
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:54,672
And I guess I was just so self-absorbed
that I couldn't see it.

96
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:57,550
I just...
I feel like an idiot, and I...

97
00:11:58,759 --> 00:11:59,635
I'm sorry.

98
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:03,973
You don't have to be sorry.
And you are not an idiot. You're not.

99
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,266
It's just...

100
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:10,396
I didn't even understand it myself
for the longest time.

101
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:14,984
I just... I think it needed to happen
the way it happened.

102
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,610
I needed to find my own way.

103
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,822
But what matters is
that you're still here,

104
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,491
and you still think we can be friends.

105
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,827
Friends? No, thanks.

106
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,288
Best friends.

107
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,375
All right, come on.

108
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:34,868
We've got a planet to catch.

109
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,300
<i>What the hell
is taking them so long?</i>

110
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:43,432
I don't know. Maybe it has something to do
with the fact that it's a 500-foot tower.

111
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,765
If something's wrong, they'll contact us.

112
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,559
Yeah, no, yeah.
I mean, unless they're already dead.

113
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:53,647
Okay, uh, stress gives me
the munchies, so I, um...

114
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,317
Do you want anything?

115
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,443
No.

116
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:58,569
Okay.

117
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,991
Actually, can I get a...

118
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,241
Vickie?

119
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,077
Vickie!

120
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,189
Holy shit.

121
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:05,678
Mm. I swear to God,
nothing cures anxiety quite like a bowl...

122
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,627
Trippy, isn't it?

123
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,173
Hi.

124
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,023
Thanks, man.

125
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:00,733
Okay.

126
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:13,495
It's pretty damn spectacular.

127
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,275
It's almost too bad
we have to blow it all up.

128
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,389
Mother of God.

129
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,493
Jim, do you, uh, copy?

130
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,036
Yeah, yeah, copy.

131
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,330
<i>Well,
I got some good news, bad news.</i>

132
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:58,416
<i>Uh, good news is our theory was correct.</i>

133
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:01,168
<i>A giant planet is descending
upon our heads.</i>

134
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,963
The bad news is our theory was correct.

135
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:07,049
A giant planet is descending
upon our heads.

136
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,176
-How long do we have?
<i>-Not long.</i>

137
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,553
Supergirl better be close in there.

138
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:18,978
Come on, El.

139
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:38,414
So this is Vecna, right now in the Abyss?

140
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,792
You don't have to whisper, but yes.

141
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:45,713
Okay, so why don't we just kill him
right here?

142
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,548
I mean, he seems pretty damn vulnerable.

143
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:48,716
We can't hurt him here.

144
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,176
We have to enter his mind.

145
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,677
-Isn't this his mind?
-No.

146
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,179
-It's my mind.
-What?

147
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,221
Hold on.

148
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,317
Are you okay?

149
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:12,448
Oh, great.

150
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,075
I've really missed this.

151
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:16,702
Hop.

152
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:19,997
The Abyss is moving.

153
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,416
-How close are we to Henry's house?
-Not close.

154
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,460
-How not close?
-I'm not sure.

155
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,337
You said you know his mind
backwards and forwards.

156
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,340
Yeah, I do, but there are a shit ton
of memories in here.

157
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:32,551
We're like Dorothy in Oz,
except there's no Yellow Brick Road.

158
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:35,388
Everything connects,
but there are long ways and short ways.

159
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,682
-Well, we need a short way.
-Yeah, no shit.

160
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:40,184
Now can you just stop talking
while I try and think?

161
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:43,604
-Joyce, this that stupid play of yours?
-Better see you there, Harrington.

162
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:46,023
Yeah, on a Friday night? You wish.

163
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,858
Come on, I have an idea.

164
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,527
-Is that Joyce?
-Yep.

165
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,737
And through that door,
Hop's sneaking a joint.

166
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,699
And that way, Mr. Wheeler
is feeling up Mrs. Wheeler.

167
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:57,826
I wish we had time to sightsee,
but we've got a play to catch.

168
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,220
<i>Three, two, one, go!</i>

169
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,422
<i>Yeah, we're gonna sweep around the back.</i>

170
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,313
West room's clear.

171
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,905
South side!

172
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:42,329
<i>We are at location.
Negative on...</i>

173
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:09,398
No, no, no, guys. It's not lining up.

174
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:10,858
What do you mean?

175
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,673
Look. The tower needle,
it's not lining up with the rift.

176
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:15,321
Shit.

177
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:18,074
-If the Abyss hits the needle...
-This tower's going down.

178
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,284
That's great. That's just great.

179
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:23,329
Hey, Chief,
we're gonna need El to stop this planet.

180
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:26,373
<i>-On the sooner side, please.</i>
-How soon?

181
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,000
Thirty seconds?

182
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,735
What are we doing?

183
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:56,360
-Waiting.
-For what?

184
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,782
Three. We need to strike.

185
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,996
Chief, talk to me.
What's going on in there?

186
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,582
I don't know. I can't talk to her.
I gave her the signal.

187
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:10,334
Well, nothing's happening over here,

188
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:14,087
and we're about to be squashed
by a moving planet. So give it again!

189
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:18,341
-We have to go.
-This is the only way. Just trust me.

190
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:30,229
Shit!

191
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,210
Look out! Look out! Look out!

192
00:20:58,465 --> 00:20:59,967
Now!

193
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:12,896
Steve!

194
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,987
Steve!

195
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:42,009
Just hold on! I got you. Just hold on!

196
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,355
We're alive! We're alive!

197
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,440
Shit, I thought you were toast.

198
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:03,822
The Abyss stopped! El got him!
I repeat, El got the bastard!

199
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,825
<i>Yes! Wow! Come on!</i>

200
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:12,998
You came back. You came back for me.

201
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:16,418
And I'm not leaving your side, ever again.

202
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,796
Not until we're out of here. All of us.

203
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,172
It's her! It's the monster!

204
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:22,925
-Get up!
-No, I'm not the monster.

205
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,051
And I can prove it.

206
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:55,291
All clear!

207
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,333
Hold this.

208
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:58,544
-Hey!
-Easy!

209
00:22:58,627 --> 00:22:59,795
-You ready?
-Ready?

210
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:00,837
Yeah.

211
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,383
Okay, easy. Easy. I got you, man.

212
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,218
All right, here goes nothing.

213
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:27,823
Holy shit.

214
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,784
Does this officially make us
space travelers?

215
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:33,370
Interdimensional space travelers.

216
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,164
Suck it, Armstrong.

217
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,232
It's over.

218
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,321
Where are they?

219
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,281
With Max.

220
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:11,116
Safe.

221
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,872
Where are they?

222
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:18,457
I told you.

223
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:20,292
With Max.

224
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:23,128
Far away from here.

225
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,506
You can't believe it, can you?

226
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:30,135
That they would ever
see through your lies.

227
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,347
Why can't he see us?

228
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:36,808
Because Mr. Whatsit isn't the only one
with magic powers.

229
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,857
That's why you take children.

230
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:48,945
Because you think they have weak minds.

231
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:56,161
But they're smarter than you think.

232
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,538
And you?

233
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,166
Are you smart?

234
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,586
You let yourself get caught.

235
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,257
And in here...

236
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:15,597
I will find all the answers I need.

237
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:32,990
Holy shit.

238
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,617
It's him. He's the Black Thing.

239
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:40,205
Everything Holly told you is true.
He is trying to destroy our world.

240
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:42,875
But he can't do it, not without you.

241
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,919
We have to escape. Right now.

242
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:54,970
Stronger, aren't we?

243
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:58,848
So am I.

244
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,101
Holly!

245
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,147
<i>I can follow her into his mind.</i>

246
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:10,110
We can end our brother, together.

247
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:23,999
Come on!

248
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:29,754
Now!

249
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,965
Hello, brother.

250
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:57,365
Don't know about you guys,

251
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,369
but I was expecting more like...

252
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,621
-Deadly vines?
-Or monsters?

253
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:05,624
I assume the hive mind works here too.
So if Henry died,

254
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:08,043
-so did all his nasty, little minions.
-"If"?

255
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,712
We don't know what's going on in the mind.

256
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,881
I know El broke the spell
and stopped the Abyss,

257
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,008
but she could still be fighting him.

258
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,137
Hey. She's been training for this.

259
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:22,599
And she's not alone.
She's got Kali and Max.

260
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:26,227
And I'm sure Henry's dead.
And if he's not, he will be.

261
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:28,605
Yeah.

262
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,150
Great job keeping the morale up.

263
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,071
Hey, man.

264
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:38,657
Hey.

265
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,661
Thought I was a goner back there.

266
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:45,914
Owe you one.

267
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:47,749
Yeah.

268
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,088
Look, just because I don't like you,

269
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:55,674
doesn't mean I want you dead.

270
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:00,053
And I've got a feeling
we're gonna need you up here.

271
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:04,432
I don't blame you, by the way.

272
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:06,768
For not liking me.

273
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:10,438
You know, I can be a real prick sometimes.

274
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:13,274
Yeah.

275
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,069
I mean, same.

276
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:21,116
Look, Steve,

277
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,327
when I was away in California,

278
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,873
you were there for Nancy
when I couldn't be.

279
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:35,714
And I thought that, you know,
that was why things were off with us.

280
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:38,883
But the truth is

281
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:42,053
our problems had nothing to do with you.

282
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,391
It just took me a long time
to figure that out.

283
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:50,353
And...

284
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,522
to let her go.

285
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,737
If we hadn't been so busy fighting,

286
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:02,449
I probably could've saved you
a little bit of time, because...

287
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:08,079
I've known for a while now me and Nance
were never really in the cards.

288
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:12,125
You know, she's independent.
She's gotta get out there, and...

289
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:14,753
-I don't know. I want...
-Six little nuggets?

290
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,089
She told you that?

291
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:23,823
You think it would've been better
if I'd said four?

292
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:26,807
Maybe just not calling them nuggets.

293
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:27,974
Right.

294
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:31,311
Listen, bottom line, end of the day, I...

295
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:34,689
I'd rather have her as a friend
than nothing at all.

296
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:37,818
You know, she's... she's just really...

297
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,194
-Special.
-Yeah.

298
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:43,364
I guess we can agree on one thing.

299
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:46,034
Yeah, I guess so.

300
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:53,291
-I still don't like you, though.
-I wouldn't want it any other way.

301
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:56,712
Hey, lovebirds!

302
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,463
You're gonna wanna check this out.

303
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,258
Jesus Christ.

304
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:13,978
That's it.

305
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,523
That's what I saw in my vision.

306
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:18,983
The kids are in there.

307
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:22,612
Then what are we waiting for?

308
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:34,916
Derek? No! Derek, you have to keep going.

309
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:37,252
-I can't.
-Derek, what are you doing? Come on!

310
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:40,297
Just leave me!
Save yourselves, you dumbasses!

311
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,423
No, don't be an idiot!

312
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,424
-I'm not being an idiot!
-Yes, you are! No, you can't...

313
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,436
-Is everyone okay?
-Yeah, we're okay.

314
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,495
-Did you find him? Tell me you found him.
-He just vanished.

315
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:59,191
He went back to the real world.

316
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:01,318
He can come back. <i>Will</i> come back.

317
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:02,652
How far to the cave?

318
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:04,279
It's not far. Come on.

319
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,406
Derek, we gotta go. Right now.

320
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:07,699
Go! Run!

321
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:16,791
Dustin! Lucas!
What's going on? Come on, talk to me!

322
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,899
You knew this would happen.

323
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:28,529
Just like you know
what will happen to her.

324
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:31,866
Don't you see, Jane?

325
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:37,289
It's a cycle.
It's a terrible, vicious cycle.

326
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:40,291
But we can stop it. Tonight.

327
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:45,463
How?

328
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:49,718
After we kill our brother,
after the children are rescued,

329
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:53,722
we don't leave with the others.
We stay on the bridge.

330
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:56,015
When the Upside Down vanishes...

331
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,061
so will we.

332
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,148
It is the only way, Jane.

333
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:07,276
The only way.

334
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:13,074
<i>She's going to do it, Jim.
She's going to end her life.</i>

335
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,742
Show yourself!

336
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:18,163
Show yourself, you lying bastard!

337
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:23,627
<i>I am many things,
but I am not a liar.</i>

338
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,421
<i>I have seen into her mind,</i>

339
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:29,883
<i>and now I have seen into yours.</i>

340
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:32,218
<i>What rage it holds!</i>

341
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:37,265
<i>One daughter dead because of you,
and soon another.</i>

342
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,642
Show yourself!

343
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:42,854
<i>You are as you fear.</i>

344
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:45,732
You are the curse.

345
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,293
No!

346
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:22,935
Why's he signaling?

347
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:29,525
-That's not a signal.
-Then what is it?

348
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,620
Oh, God.

349
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,122
Holly!

350
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,124
Get to the cave!

351
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:50,421
I got you. Hang on.

352
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:51,964
Hang on!

353
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,511
Hold on. Hold on.

354
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:04,811
What did you do?

355
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:14,904
Hi there.

356
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:30,253
Hey, Doc.

357
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,755
Kids left out their homework.

358
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,643
-Max!
-What happened?

359
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:48,188
She just poofed away
like a goddamn ghost!

360
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:50,857
Was it the Black Thing?
Did the Black Thing take them?

361
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,150
Listen up!

362
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:56,905
We keep to the plan. Get to the cave.
The Black Thing can't hurt us there.

363
00:35:56,988 --> 00:36:00,742
So follow me, keep quiet, and stay close.

364
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,702
-Let's go! Come on.
-Come on, guys.

365
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:04,412
Let's go! Hurry!

366
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,916
The kids are all alone in there.
You have to get us back to them.

367
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:11,920
I can't, not without the bath.
He locked us out.

368
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:15,381
We have to get to the Abyss,
join the others. We can kill him there.

369
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:19,177
There is no time. The worlds will collide
long before we reach him.

370
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,930
Not if Holly and the kids make it
to the cave.

371
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:26,101
If Dustin is right,
without the kids, Henry can't do anything.

372
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,852
That's a lot of ifs.

373
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:29,604
What do you wanna do?

374
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,899
We can't give up, not now.

375
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:35,651
Isn't that exactly what you're doing?
Giving up.

376
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,322
I know the truth.

377
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:42,534
Henry showed me your plan.

378
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,202
Henry lied to you.

379
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:45,745
He tricked you.

380
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:48,498
He used you, and you fell for it.

381
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:50,337
Then look me in the eye and tell me.

382
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,710
Tell me.

383
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:55,338
Tell me you don't plan
on killing yourself tonight.

384
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,967
We don't have time for this.
We have to go.

385
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,927
I won't detonate it.

386
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,056
-I won't.
-What?

387
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:06,850
I will not detonate the C-4,

388
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:10,979
not until I know that you are safe
with the others back in Hawkins.

389
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:16,109
If we kill Henry and don't destroy
the Upside Down, nothing matters.

390
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:21,197
Which is why I will destroy it
once I know that you're safe.

391
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,532
Why are you doing this?

392
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:25,160
Because Henry's gotten to him,
and he's lost his mind.

393
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:28,120
-Kali, wait.
-No. This is bigger than him, Jane.

394
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:32,083
-Bigger than any of us.
-Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead. Shoot me.

395
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:35,336
If I'm alive, then so is Henry.

396
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:37,672
I have to end the cycle.

397
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:40,675
You will. You will. But not like this.

398
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:43,844
Not with more violence.
Not with more pain.

399
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:47,306
There's already been so much pain.

400
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,475
From the moment you were born.

401
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:53,605
Your mother was taken from you.
Your childhood was taken from you.

402
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:58,276
You've been attacked, manipulated, abused

403
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:00,987
by terrible people.

404
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:04,323
Life has been so unfair to you,

405
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,284
so cruel.

406
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,454
But you never let it break you.

407
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:11,580
And I need you to fight, kid.

408
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:15,167
I just need you to fight one last time.

409
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:18,546
Fight for the happy days
on the other side of this.

410
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,006
Fight for...

411
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:24,385
for a world beyond Hawkins.

412
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:27,722
Fight for that day
that you have a kid of your own,

413
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:31,642
and you give her the life
that you never had.

414
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,732
For the day you get so angry
because she invites some boy over,

415
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:40,010
and she won't keep the door open
three inches.

416
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:42,695
I know.

417
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:45,364
I know you don't believe
you can have any of this.

418
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,325
But I promise you

419
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:50,244
we will find a way to make it real.

420
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:53,914
<i>You</i> will find a way to make it real.

421
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:56,584
Because you have to.

422
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:01,130
Because you deserve it.

423
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:06,552
<i>Jim!</i>

424
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:08,221
<i>Jim! Are you there, Jim?</i>

425
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:12,724
I don't want to add to the stress,
but we've got company.

426
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:36,165
Come on! Come on!
We're almost there! Keep going!

427
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:39,210
Through this gap right here! Right here!
Come on! One by one!

428
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:40,586
Go! Go! Go!

429
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:43,589
Debbie, wait!

430
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:47,676
Have you seen Derek?

431
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,431
-Derek!
-Wait! Holly!

432
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,432
-Derek!
-Holly!

433
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:04,819
Come on! Come on! We got this!
We gotta go! Come on! Hurry up!

434
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:08,823
Keep running! Come on, Derek! Come on!

435
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:11,701
Get inside. He's coming! Go!

436
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:12,868
Come on!

437
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:18,833
Holly!

438
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:27,633
Go!

439
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,929
-Suck my fat one!
-Come on!

440
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:37,476
Holly!

441
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:41,022
-Are you okay?
-We're okay. We're okay.

442
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,398
Was it him? Was it Henry?

443
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:47,612
Yes, but he can't get us. Okay?
Not in here. We're safe now.

444
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,321
-Okay.
-We're safe.

445
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:15,055
-Why are you staring at me?
-I'm not!

446
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:21,437
We're just getting really close, okay?
And we don't know what's in there,

447
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,232
so I think you should be sharing
some of that firepower.

448
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,650
You have firepower.

449
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,485
Three Molotovs? Come on!

450
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:29,570
Unless you're okay living
with the guilt of my death,

451
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,653
I'm gonna need one of those goddamn guns!

452
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:40,831
Holy shit!

453
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:42,458
Thanks!

454
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:46,337
Those are flares.

455
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,505
What?

456
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:51,217
Flares. She gave you a flare gun, dude.

457
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:53,761
What?

458
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:54,971
Flare gun?

459
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:58,557
Nancy! Nancy, what the hell is this?
Are you serious?

460
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,976
You think this is a joke?

461
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:04,874
What the hell am I gonna do
with a flare gun?

462
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,110
<i>Hey! Will!</i>

463
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:12,405
-Will!
-Will!

464
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:15,283
Hey! What is it? What's wrong?

465
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:16,450
It's Henry.

466
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:18,786
He's alive.

467
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:53,195
<i>Resist it.</i>

468
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:57,366
<i>How did you find me?</i>

469
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,000
<i>They sent you.</i>

470
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:09,420
<i>Resist it.</i>

471
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:19,221
Will!

472
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:23,142
What was that?

473
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:24,727
Holly?

474
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:27,354
Stay here.

475
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:49,460
What's going on? What do you see?

476
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:53,548
It's Henry. He's made it into the cave.

477
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:59,094
He's coming! Go! Go! Up here! Everyone!
Come on! Go, go, go, go, go!

478
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:04,016
Hurry! Come on, quickly! Go! Go!

479
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:07,853
He's found them.
He's found Holly and the kids.

480
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:09,188
Okay, what about El?

481
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:12,400
Do you see El? Or Kali? Or Max?

482
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:15,277
They're alone. They're all alone.

483
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,865
-Go! Go! Hurry!
-Come on, guys!

484
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:30,376
Could you stop him? With your powers?

485
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:33,128
I can try. Just keep going.

486
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:34,838
Go! Go!

487
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:47,810
Move! Move! Move!

488
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:01,824
Come on! Come on!

489
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:25,097
Oh, God.

490
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:41,697
Hurry! Let's go!

491
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:44,533
Quickly! Come on!
It's right up here, this hole!

492
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:48,787
Joshua, down there! Be careful, okay?
Keep moving! Thomas, you next!

493
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:02,301
<i>Jim, do you copy?</i>

494
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:04,803
Jim, do you copy?

495
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:06,764
Goddammit!

496
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:24,156
Kali.

497
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:35,459
Well, well. Look what we got here.

498
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,629
Your friends just left you here, huh?

499
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:40,566
Well, that's not very nice, now is it?

500
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:45,344
Hmm.

501
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:47,596
Get her out of here.

502
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:02,444
Hey. Hey.

503
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:05,280
I got you. I got you.

504
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:07,908
And I got you.

505
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:16,584
All right, listen.
Anything you see in here is not real.

506
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:19,295
It can't hurt you.
Just keep your eyes on me, okay?

507
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:20,337
-Okay.
-Okay.

508
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:24,552
Come on, let's go.

509
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:28,137
Keep going. Stay close.

510
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:30,264
Eyes on me, okay? Eyes on me.

511
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:31,681
Just keep moving.

512
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:34,351
Holy shit balls!

513
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:36,436
Eyes on me, Derek!

514
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:41,984
Through here. You get to the other side,
and you wait for me.

515
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:43,694
Debbie, you first.

516
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:49,283
Thomas, your turn.

517
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:51,327
-Come on, guys. Let's hurry up!
-Let's go!

518
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:54,329
-Come on! Come on! We got this.
-Hurry up, Glenn.

519
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:58,292
Go!

520
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:08,552
Tell me where the other freak is,
or this one dies right here, right now.

521
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:11,680
I don't know what you're talking about.
It's just us.

522
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:15,892
You think I'm playing a game here?
Where is she?

523
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:32,284
Okay. Oh, what are you doing, Murray?
This is not a good plan.

524
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:34,662
This is crazy.

525
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:38,832
Okay. Here goes absolutely nothing.

526
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,835
One last chance.

527
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:44,338
Where is she?

528
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:55,182
Go to hell.

529
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:57,351
Okay, then.

530
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:25,313
Kali.

531
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:28,442
No, no, no!

532
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:29,777
Kali. Kali.

533
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:33,030
-Get bandages please.
-Keep pressure on the wound.

534
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,282
Kali, look at me. Look at me.

535
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:38,452
Hang in there, okay?
I'm here. It's gonna be okay.

536
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:42,122
I'm not going to make it.

537
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:46,752
No, don't say that. You will. You will.
You will make it, okay?

538
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:48,170
Don't cry, Jane.

539
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:51,673
My story...

540
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:54,843
was always going to end here.

541
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:56,762
No.

542
00:50:57,971 --> 00:50:59,306
No, no.

543
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:38,220
Holly.

544
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:42,724
Holly?

545
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,371
How did you find me?

546
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:06,581
Please.

547
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:10,293
Please, mister. Don't shoot.

548
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:12,129
Who are you?

549
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:16,550
Henry. Henry Creel. I live near here.

550
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:17,926
Who sent you?

551
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:21,180
Nobody sent me.
I was in the caves. I heard a scream.

552
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:24,266
They sent you. They sent you!

553
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:26,934
You're just confused.
You need a doctor.

554
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:33,400
What's happening?

555
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,987
He's in a memory now.

556
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:38,947
And he's scared.

557
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:41,032
He's so scared.

558
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:54,088
Oh my God. Thank God. Thank God.
Thank God. Thank God.

559
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:58,467
I thought you two were goners
for a minute there.

560
00:52:58,550 --> 00:52:59,843
Oh, what?

561
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:02,721
No hug from the big man, huh?

562
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:05,349
How about a "thank you
for destroying the Huey, Murray."

563
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:08,602
"That was very brave and... and..."

564
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:11,271
What's wrong?

565
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:13,190
Wait.

566
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:15,442
Kali. Where's... Where's Kali?

567
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:19,404
Oh God.

568
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:21,364
El, I'm...

569
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:24,117
I'm so sorry.

570
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:43,720
I can jump.

571
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:47,515
I can jump those boulders to the Abyss.

572
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:51,144
I'll be right there,
right at the tree. Shortcut.

573
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:53,689
Henry's still up there.

574
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:55,524
-If you fall...
-I won't.

575
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:57,108
If you make it...

576
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:01,864
I kill him.

577
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:03,281
Oh, yeah?

578
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:04,950
And then what?

579
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:18,129
When I was a kid,
and you found me in the woods...

580
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:24,803
<i>I was scared.</i>

581
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:27,389
Really scared.

582
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,727
I didn't understand the world.

583
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:36,690
I didn't understand... people.

584
00:54:40,902 --> 00:54:42,279
You took me in.

585
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:48,285
Raised me.

586
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:49,995
Protected me.

587
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:51,538
Mm.

588
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:08,430
You became my dad.

589
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:20,191
But I'm not... a kid anymore.

590
00:55:33,371 --> 00:55:34,748
And I'm not Sara.

591
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:47,093
She didn't have a choice to make.

592
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:53,391
But I do.

593
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:57,645
And I need you

594
00:55:58,313 --> 00:56:00,607
to trust me to make the right choice.

595
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:10,992
I need you to believe in me.

596
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:54,596
<i>Find me.</i>

597
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:05,190
Ah!

598
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:10,403
You must resist it.

599
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:14,491
It will consume you.

600
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:19,621
It will consume all.

601
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:50,443
It wasn't you.

602
00:58:52,153 --> 00:58:53,863
<i>It was never you.</i>

603
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:57,826
Leave me alone.

604
00:58:57,909 --> 00:59:01,329
That's why the Mind Flayer didn't want you
in the cave.

605
00:59:01,412 --> 00:59:02,924
It didn't want you to remember.

606
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:08,170
I said leave me alone.

607
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:12,048
You were just a kid, a kid like me.

608
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:14,509
<i>And it used you.</i>

609
00:59:15,176 --> 00:59:17,595
<i>It used you to bring it here.</i>

610
00:59:18,346 --> 00:59:20,223
You're just like me, Henry.

611
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:22,392
A vessel.

612
00:59:23,476 --> 00:59:26,605
<i>But you can resist it. Help us fight it.</i>

613
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:30,525
Don't let it win, Henry, please.
Don't let it win.

614
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:36,948
No.

615
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:40,994
It showed me the truth.

616
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:50,045
It showed me that this world is broken.

617
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:52,422
That man is broken.

618
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:56,259
Don't listen to it, Henry.
It is controlling you right now.

619
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:08,062
It has never controlled me.

620
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:11,357
And I never controlled it.

621
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:25,538
Don't you see, William?

622
01:00:26,247 --> 01:00:28,958
<i>I could have resisted it.</i>

623
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:31,919
But I chose

624
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:33,962
to join it.

625
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:41,304
Oh my God.

626
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:55,777
It needs... me.

627
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,284
And I need it.

628
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:11,793
We...

629
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:16,506
...are...

630
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:19,801
one.

631
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:25,640
Run!

632
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:27,433
Run! Run! Run!

633
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:42,782
Dustin!

634
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:50,164
-Come on! Come on!
-Let's go!

635
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:53,710
Come on!

636
01:01:55,336 --> 01:01:56,170
Shit!

637
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:10,644
Come on, go! Go, go, go!

638
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,228
Run! Run! Run!

639
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:14,040
-She's hurting it.
-How?

640
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:14,958
She's fighting Vecna.

641
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:16,250
Hive mind.

642
01:03:26,427 --> 01:03:27,887
So...

643
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:32,433
you truly do want to die.

644
01:03:39,857 --> 01:03:41,526
-We have to help her.
-How?

645
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:45,071
The hive mind works in both ways.
If we hurt the Mind Flayer, we hurt Vecna.

646
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:47,031
What, hurt Godzilla over there?

647
01:03:47,114 --> 01:03:50,160
The only way to damage anything
of that scale, we spread out.

648
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:52,662
Flank it on all sides.
Just chip away at its hit points.

649
01:03:52,745 --> 01:03:54,581
"Hit points"? What are you talking about?

650
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:55,707
There.

651
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:59,836
One of us draws it to that canyon.
The rest take positions on those cliffs.

652
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:02,129
Ambush it from above.

653
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:05,091
There's just one question.

654
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:07,760
Which one of us is bait?

655
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:11,681
I am.

656
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,163
Go!

657
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:39,125
Come on.

658
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:58,895
No!

659
01:04:59,478 --> 01:05:00,313
No, no!

660
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:02,857
There's nothing we can do!
Come on, please!

661
01:06:08,714 --> 01:06:11,257
Boom!

662
01:06:42,748 --> 01:06:44,333
Look out! Look out!

663
01:06:48,879 --> 01:06:51,674
-This is for Eddie, you son of a bitch!
-For Eddie!

664
01:07:32,757 --> 01:07:34,800
I'm not afraid anymore.

665
01:07:42,099 --> 01:07:43,059
We're not...

666
01:07:44,935 --> 01:07:45,978
afraid...

667
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:50,149
of you.

668
01:08:04,997 --> 01:08:06,165
Yeah!

669
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:08,543
We gotta go!

670
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:10,086
Run! Shit, shit, shit!

671
01:08:48,874 --> 01:08:49,875
El!

672
01:08:53,546 --> 01:08:54,672
Is everyone okay?

673
01:08:56,590 --> 01:08:57,466
Holly.

674
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:22,909
Holly? Can you hear me?

675
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:27,037
Holly? Holly, come on. Come on.

676
01:09:40,801 --> 01:09:41,635
Nancy?

677
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:46,390
Yeah. Yeah, it's me. I'm here.

678
01:09:46,473 --> 01:09:50,477
Yeah, it's me. I'm here. I'm here.

679
01:09:52,771 --> 01:09:54,148
Holly?

680
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:56,901
Hey!

681
01:09:58,444 --> 01:09:59,445
Hey.

682
01:10:26,430 --> 01:10:29,767
Okay, get it all out.
You got this. You're gonna be okay.

683
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:31,853
Where... Where am I?

684
01:10:31,936 --> 01:10:35,439
You're safe. You're safe, bud, okay?
We're here to get you home.

685
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:37,358
Yeah. Whoa!

686
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:41,237
I got you, bud. I got you.
I got you, bud. It's okay.

687
01:11:44,258 --> 01:11:46,594
Please, please. Come back to me!

688
01:11:46,677 --> 01:11:49,305
No!

689
01:11:59,273 --> 01:12:01,107
You fucked with the wrong family.

690
01:12:10,117 --> 01:12:11,994
Mom, you're killing him!

691
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:14,246
<i>Help!</i>

692
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:18,959
<i>Why don't you
go ahead and go home?</i>

693
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:23,047
<i>I didn't run away this time.</i>

694
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:24,757
<i>Eddie!</i>

695
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:25,966
<i>I love you, man.</i>

696
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:27,885
<i>Goodbye, Mike.</i>

697
01:12:28,552 --> 01:12:30,929
El! El, where are you?

698
01:12:32,264 --> 01:12:34,767
<i>He did not make me into this.</i>

699
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:36,101
<i>You did.</i>

700
01:12:38,937 --> 01:12:40,272
<i>Will, wake up!</i>

701
01:12:41,273 --> 01:12:42,524
Go away!

702
01:12:44,401 --> 01:12:46,236
I just want this to be over.

703
01:13:38,705 --> 01:13:41,375
-<i>Chief, you copy? Chief?</i>
-Yeah, yeah, I copy. What's going on?

704
01:13:41,458 --> 01:13:43,919
Well, the nose less bastard's toast.

705
01:13:44,002 --> 01:13:48,006
We're back in the Upside Down,
and we have the kids.

706
01:13:51,218 --> 01:13:53,429
How is everybody? Is everybody okay?

707
01:13:54,138 --> 01:13:56,870
Yeah, the party took a hell of a beating,
but we're okay.

708
01:13:58,225 --> 01:13:59,268
What about El?

709
01:14:00,936 --> 01:14:02,146
The whole party.

710
01:14:07,985 --> 01:14:10,071
<i>So what do we say
you hit the music, old man?</i>

711
01:14:10,154 --> 01:14:12,489
<i>Destroy the Upside Down once and for all.</i>

712
01:14:13,198 --> 01:14:14,950
Let's ditch this hellscape.

713
01:14:16,243 --> 01:14:17,369
Yeah, copy that.

714
01:14:34,761 --> 01:14:37,722
All right. The countdown begins.

715
01:14:51,195 --> 01:14:53,655
Hey, stop!
You're gonna get it all over me!

716
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:58,035
Hey, hey, I'm nasty too.

717
01:14:58,619 --> 01:15:00,162
It does stink.

718
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:08,087

01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:11,006

726
01:15:31,401 --> 01:15:34,196
What are you doing? You're gonna let
more of that crap in here.

727
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:37,032
It's either that or pass out.

728
01:15:37,115 --> 01:15:39,159
Because you smell like...

729
01:15:40,619 --> 01:15:43,705
I actually don't know what you smell like,
but it's bad.

730
01:15:55,342 --> 01:15:56,885
Assholes.

731
01:15:57,761 --> 01:15:59,096
Eh?

732
01:16:00,013 --> 01:16:01,306
That's good.

733
01:16:02,891 --> 01:16:04,851
There she is, home sweet home.

734
01:16:06,144 --> 01:16:09,106
So, Jimbo, I just gotta ask.
How does it feel?

735
01:16:09,648 --> 01:16:12,318
Feels like I need a nap and a smoke.

736
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:13,986
-I thought you quit.
-Yeah.

737
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:16,446
That's why it's gonna taste so good.

738
01:16:26,915 --> 01:16:28,000
Watch out!

739
01:16:33,964 --> 01:16:35,132
Everyone okay?

740
01:16:41,138 --> 01:16:43,265
Everyone put your hands up!

741
01:16:43,348 --> 01:16:44,683
I said, hands up!

742
01:16:44,766 --> 01:16:46,185
-Move!
-Hey! Get off me!

743
01:16:46,268 --> 01:16:48,562
Get down! Get down! Get your hands up!

744
01:16:49,563 --> 01:16:51,232
-I said hands up!
-Oh, wow!

745
01:16:51,315 --> 01:16:53,774
Okay, okay.

746
01:16:54,985 --> 01:16:57,738
No! No! That's my sister! Let go of me!

747
01:16:57,821 --> 01:16:59,531
-Yeah, yeah!
-Okay, okay!

748
01:17:06,204 --> 01:17:07,456
Let's go! Move!

749
01:17:07,539 --> 01:17:09,666
-Dustin!
-Holly, what's happening?

750
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:13,170
Everybody up! Everybody up!

751
01:17:14,171 --> 01:17:15,756
El? Do you see El?

752
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:19,426
Sergeant! Where's the girl?

753
01:17:19,509 --> 01:17:21,928
She was right here one second ago.

754
01:17:25,766 --> 01:17:26,850
She must have escaped.

755
01:17:35,776 --> 01:17:36,610
Oh God.

756
01:17:40,614 --> 01:17:43,325
-Mike...
-Get off me! Get off me!

757
01:17:54,378 --> 01:17:55,212
You...

758
01:17:55,295 --> 01:17:57,881
You have to get out of there!
You have to get out!

759
01:17:57,964 --> 01:18:00,384
None of this will ever end,
not if I'm still here.

760
01:18:00,467 --> 01:18:03,971
No, no. We'll figure something out.
We'll fight back. We always do.

761
01:18:04,054 --> 01:18:05,973
I need you to talk to the others.

762
01:18:06,056 --> 01:18:09,393
-No. No.
-I need you to thank them for me.

763
01:18:09,476 --> 01:18:11,186
For being so kind to me.

764
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:14,148
And teaching me what it means
to be a friend.

765
01:18:14,231 --> 01:18:16,025
No! Please don't do this.

766
01:18:16,108 --> 01:18:19,862
Mike, I need you
to help them understand my choice.

767
01:18:19,945 --> 01:18:21,530
But I don't. I don't understand.

768
01:18:21,613 --> 01:18:22,698
I know.

769
01:18:23,865 --> 01:18:24,991
But you will.

770
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:26,868
One day, you will.

771
01:18:28,328 --> 01:18:29,830
You understand me.

772
01:18:32,457 --> 01:18:33,834
Better than anyone.

773
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:36,169
You always have.

774
01:18:37,421 --> 01:18:38,922
From the day we met...

775
01:18:47,055 --> 01:18:48,390
...you've seen me.

776
01:18:48,974 --> 01:18:52,061
Well, my name's Mike. Short for Michael.

777
01:18:52,144 --> 01:18:54,980
Maybe we can call you El.
Short for Eleven.

778
01:18:59,359 --> 01:19:00,611

It's been a while.</i>

807
01:24:06,916 --> 01:24:08,668
<i>I wonder... I mean...</i>

808
01:24:09,169 --> 01:24:12,047
<i>Do you guys... even remember me?</i>

809
01:24:13,173 --> 01:24:15,592
Okay, maybe I'm being too modest.
I mean, let's be honest,

810
01:24:15,675 --> 01:24:19,637
who could forget this soothing voice
with a trace of a Debra Winger rasp?

811
01:24:20,263 --> 01:24:26,728
That's right. It's me,
Robin Buckley, aka Rockin' Robin.

812
01:24:26,811 --> 01:24:29,398
Jimmy "Fast Hands" was kind enough
to let me back into the booth

813
01:24:29,481 --> 01:24:30,983
for a guest stint,

814
01:24:31,066 --> 01:24:35,612
but you're gonna have to cut me some slack
because I am feeling rusty.

815
01:24:36,321 --> 01:24:38,490
I mean, what do I even talk about?
You know?

816
01:24:38,573 --> 01:24:43,745
My go-to subjects are as out of date
as, well, as my friend's bowl cut.

817
01:24:44,496 --> 01:24:47,082
<i>I mean, there's no soldiers,</i>

818
01:24:47,957 --> 01:24:49,250
<i>no fences,</i>

819
01:24:49,918 --> 01:24:51,920
<i>no Big Brother cameras,</i>

820
01:24:52,003 --> 01:24:55,465
<i>and the only Big Mac I can find
is a Smush Double Patty at Mickey D's.</i>

821
01:24:56,216 --> 01:25:00,971
<i>People are happy and smiling
and going to the movies.</i>

822
01:25:01,054 --> 01:25:04,099
But hey, who doesn't wanna see
Indy's new adventure?

823
01:25:04,182 --> 01:25:06,350
Shit. Uh...

824
01:25:07,644 --> 01:25:08,895
There we go.

825
01:25:10,355 --> 01:25:12,482
Sorry about that.
My partner in crime ditched me.

826
01:25:12,565 --> 01:25:15,735
But, well, as far as excuses go,

827
01:25:16,694 --> 01:25:17,988
he had a pretty good one.

828
01:25:18,071 --> 01:25:20,699
Let's go, boys!
Baseball ready! Baseball ready!

829
01:25:20,782 --> 01:25:23,035
-<i>Now...
-</i> No mental mistakes!

830
01:25:23,118 --> 01:25:26,079
<i>...I am almost
too superstitious to say this,</i>

831
01:25:26,162 --> 01:25:27,873
<i>and I'm knocking on some wood here,</i>

832
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:32,961
<i>but I think the Hawkins curse
has finally lifted.</i>

833
01:25:33,044 --> 01:25:35,172
All right, Thomas.
Let's go. Here we go, man!

834
01:25:35,255 --> 01:25:37,048
<i>-But at the same time...</i>
-Let's go.

835
01:25:37,632 --> 01:25:40,343
...this isn't even the Hawkins
that I remember.

836
01:25:41,553 --> 01:25:43,263
It feels so different.

837
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:46,641
But maybe it's not the town.

838
01:25:47,350 --> 01:25:49,769
Maybe it's me that's changed.

839
01:25:51,187 --> 01:25:52,689
We probably all have.

840
01:25:54,482 --> 01:25:57,986
At least, that's certainly true
of my friends.

841
01:25:58,528 --> 01:26:02,782
Who,
by the way, are graduating today.

842
01:26:06,786 --> 01:26:10,874
That's right, Hawkins High class of '89
is walking the podium today.

843
01:26:10,957 --> 01:26:13,460
I hope you all come out and support them.
I know I will.

844
01:26:13,543 --> 01:26:16,296
Because if anyone deserves a standing O,
they do.

845
01:26:16,379 --> 01:26:20,675
So to get their party started,
a new favorite.

846
01:26:33,062 --> 01:26:35,982
You break any more bones,
you're on your own.

847
01:26:36,566 --> 01:26:39,027
Because I am done with hospitals.

848
01:26:39,110 --> 01:26:40,821
Maybe I should be on my own.

849
01:26:40,904 --> 01:26:41,988
I mean...

850
01:26:42,572 --> 01:26:43,907
what is going on here?

851
01:26:43,990 --> 01:26:46,118
What? We're graduating today.

852
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:49,537
In two hours.
I think you're getting ahead of yourself.

853
01:26:50,622 --> 01:26:51,664
Hmm.

854
01:26:53,124 --> 01:26:55,919
Okay, now you're definitely
getting ahead of yourself.

855
01:26:56,502 --> 01:26:59,797
I'm sorry. You're just looking,
uh, super sexy right now.

856
01:27:00,465 --> 01:27:02,383

884
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:05,821
-Let him hang it up.
-You get one more take.

885
01:28:08,449 --> 01:28:10,493
It's been all day
'cause of the artist...

886
01:28:10,576 --> 01:28:13,163
-Hello?
<i>-Joyce. This is Karen. Have you seen Mike?</i>

887
01:28:13,246 --> 01:28:14,998
No, I haven't seen him.

888
01:28:15,081 --> 01:28:17,125
<i>We haven't seen him since last night.</i>

889
01:28:17,208 --> 01:28:20,253
It's Karen. She can't find Mike.

890
01:28:22,755 --> 01:28:25,466
<i>♪ Here comes your man ♪</i>

891
01:28:46,362 --> 01:28:49,699
El! El!

892
01:28:51,034 --> 01:28:52,702
El!

893
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:54,829
Hey, kid.

894
01:28:58,666 --> 01:29:00,251
Thought I might find you here.

895
01:29:04,172 --> 01:29:05,465
Your mom's freaking out.

896
01:29:06,674 --> 01:29:08,509
Can't say I blame her. I mean...

897
01:29:09,385 --> 01:29:11,805
I don't know if you remember,
but we do have a history

898
01:29:11,888 --> 01:29:14,057
of kids going missing in this town.

899
01:29:16,851 --> 01:29:18,603
She won't understand.

900
01:29:19,187 --> 01:29:24,192
She'll never understand why I can't do it,
why I can't walk the stage.

901
01:29:25,777 --> 01:29:27,070
It'd be like a lie.

902
01:29:29,155 --> 01:29:31,866
Like I'm okay with moving on.

903
01:29:31,949 --> 01:29:33,451
And I'm not.

904
01:29:35,995 --> 01:29:37,288
I'm not okay with it.

905
01:29:41,209 --> 01:29:42,502
I had this plan.

906
01:29:43,461 --> 01:29:48,174
That me and El, we were gonna go
someplace far away,

907
01:29:48,257 --> 01:29:49,926
and... and no one would find us.

908
01:29:51,219 --> 01:29:54,848
And I said this thing about going
somewhere with three waterfalls.

909
01:29:54,931 --> 01:29:57,475
I mean, I... I don't even know
if she believed me.

910
01:29:58,393 --> 01:30:03,773
Who would? Three waterfalls?
I mean, that's so stupid, childish.

911
01:30:04,524 --> 01:30:07,735
It was a fantasy plan.
I should've had a real one.

912
01:30:09,821 --> 01:30:10,863
I just didn't...

913
01:30:12,615 --> 01:30:15,160
I didn't think that she would just...

914
01:30:15,243 --> 01:30:16,869
Hey, hey. This...

915
01:30:21,207 --> 01:30:23,012
It's not your... It's not your fault.

916
01:30:25,336 --> 01:30:27,171
What happened is not your fault.

917
01:30:29,173 --> 01:30:30,925
El made her choice.

918
01:30:32,385 --> 01:30:34,470
Now it's time for you to make yours.

919
01:30:35,513 --> 01:30:38,349
And the way I see it,
you got two roads ahead of you.

920
01:30:39,183 --> 01:30:40,685
You got one road

921
01:30:41,644 --> 01:30:43,813
where you keep blaming yourself
for what happened.

922
01:30:43,896 --> 01:30:47,359
You keep going over it in your head,
what you could've done differently.

923
01:30:48,025 --> 01:30:53,156
You push people away, and you suffer,
because that's what you think you deserve.

924
01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:57,410
And then there's another road...

925
01:31:00,913 --> 01:31:05,710
where you find a way
to accept what happened.

926
01:31:06,794 --> 01:31:08,921
Find a way to accept her choice.

927
01:31:10,214 --> 01:31:13,531
Doesn't mean you gotta like it.
Doesn't mean you gotta understand it.

928
01:31:14,093 --> 01:31:15,678
And never think about it.

929
01:31:17,930 --> 01:31:19,223
You just accept it.

930
01:31:20,808 --> 01:31:23,436
And you live the best goddamn life
you can.

931
01:31:29,484 --> 01:31:31,777
I've been down that first road before.

932
01:31:34,322 --> 01:31:35,781
And I don't recommend it.

933
01:31:38,075 --> 01:31:39,494
And as for El...

934
01:31:40,745 --> 01:31:43,748
I think you know
what she would have wanted for you.

935
01:32:05,770 --> 01:32:07,981
-I don't know. Me?
-Yeah.

936
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:11,567
-Never been.
-Me neither. But I think she'd like it.

937
01:32:29,794 --> 01:32:30,962
Good afternoon, everyone,

938
01:32:31,045 --> 01:32:35,132
and welcome to the graduation ceremony
for the class of '89.

939
01:32:39,804 --> 01:32:41,806
Mom! Mom!

940
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:51,023
Mike.

941
01:32:51,732 --> 01:32:53,776
I'm sorry, Mom. I panicked.

942
01:32:54,819 --> 01:32:56,362
You don't have to explain.

943
01:32:57,697 --> 01:32:58,906
God, look at you.

944
01:33:01,909 --> 01:33:03,286
You're all grown up.

945
01:33:04,579 --> 01:33:05,997
I'm so proud of you.

946
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:10,501
I'm so, so proud.

947
01:33:17,466 --> 01:33:18,467
I love you, Mom.

948
01:33:20,803 --> 01:33:22,221
I love you, baby.

949
01:33:24,807 --> 01:33:27,685
And now it's my great pleasure
to introduce someone

950
01:33:27,768 --> 01:33:31,189
who has truly excelled
during their time here.

951
01:33:31,272 --> 01:33:37,320
Ladies and gentlemen, give a warm welcome
for your valedictorian, Dustin Henderson.

952
01:33:39,363 --> 01:33:40,406
Yeah, buddy!

953
01:33:41,866 --> 01:33:43,034
Dustin!

954
01:33:43,117 --> 01:33:44,035
That's my friend!

955
01:33:44,118 --> 01:33:45,244
Whoo!

956
01:33:51,584 --> 01:33:54,420
<i>I just wanted a normal childhood.</i>

957
01:33:55,254 --> 01:33:57,214
But that childhood was stolen from me.

958
01:33:58,549 --> 01:34:00,426
It was stolen from us.

959
01:34:01,302 --> 01:34:03,846
And this past year,
if you wanna know the truth,

960
01:34:03,929 --> 01:34:06,266
I've been pretty pissed off about it.

961
01:34:06,349 --> 01:34:07,225
Language.

962
01:34:07,308 --> 01:34:09,269
But then I thought back
to the past six years,

963
01:34:09,352 --> 01:34:13,856
and I realized that,
even though there was a lot of bad,

964
01:34:15,024 --> 01:34:16,901
there was so much good too.

965
01:34:18,778 --> 01:34:20,947
There's this game I like to play.

966
01:34:21,030 --> 01:34:23,116
It's called Dungeons & Dragons.

967
01:34:23,199 --> 01:34:24,701
-Yup!
-Jesus Christ.

968
01:34:24,784 --> 01:34:28,246
And in this game,
there are two types of chaos classes,

969
01:34:28,329 --> 01:34:30,623
chaotic good and chaotic bad.

970
01:34:31,582 --> 01:34:36,212
Now, bad chaos brings
anarchy, destruction, war.

971
01:34:36,295 --> 01:34:40,257
But good chaos can bring innovation,

972
01:34:41,425 --> 01:34:42,426
change.

973
01:34:43,010 --> 01:34:44,303
And this school,

974
01:34:45,513 --> 01:34:47,390
frankly, it needed to change.

975
01:34:47,473 --> 01:34:53,146
Because we were so divided
into the jocks, the nerds, freaks.

976
01:34:53,229 --> 01:34:54,772
And in the chaos,

977
01:34:55,398 --> 01:34:58,359
all those walls broke down,

978
01:34:58,984 --> 01:35:00,444
and I made new friends.

979
01:35:01,195 --> 01:35:04,407
I made friends who were never even
supposed to be my friends.

980
01:35:04,990 --> 01:35:07,819
This wasn't just me.
I saw this happen with so many others.

981
01:35:08,035 --> 01:35:10,455
When you get to know people
who are different from you,

982
01:35:10,538 --> 01:35:13,582
you begin to learn more about yourself.

983
01:35:14,458 --> 01:35:15,292
You change.

984
01:35:16,877 --> 01:35:18,087
You grow.

985
01:35:18,587 --> 01:35:21,049
I'm a better person now.

986
01:35:21,132 --> 01:35:23,634
I'm a better person because of them,

987
01:35:24,218 --> 01:35:26,053
because of my friends.

988
01:35:27,012 --> 01:35:30,099
So, I'm not pissed off anymore.

989
01:35:31,225 --> 01:35:32,643
But I am worried.

990
01:35:33,394 --> 01:35:34,228
Worried,

991
01:35:35,271 --> 01:35:37,440
because now that the chaos is over,

992
01:35:37,982 --> 01:35:40,693
Principal Higgins
and every square like him

993
01:35:40,776 --> 01:35:43,780
is gonna do their damnedest
to put everything back in order.

994
01:35:43,863 --> 01:35:45,740
And I don't want order,

995
01:35:45,823 --> 01:35:48,284
which is why it's hypocritical
that I'm wearing this thing.

996
01:35:48,367 --> 01:35:51,954
I mean, we look ridiculous.
What is this? We look like Roman senators.

997
01:35:52,037 --> 01:35:55,667
I mean, it's not who I am.
I don't think it's who any of us are.

998
01:35:55,750 --> 01:35:58,836
So, honestly, just screw it.

999
01:35:58,919 --> 01:36:00,797
-Henderson.
-Yes!

1000
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:03,091
-Screw the school.
-Henderson! Henderson!

1001
01:36:03,174 --> 01:36:04,550
-Screw the system.
-That's enough!

1002
01:36:04,633 --> 01:36:05,718
Screw conformity.

1003
01:36:05,801 --> 01:36:07,220
-Screw everyone and everything...
-Yes!

1004
01:36:07,303 --> 01:36:09,305
...trying to hold you back
and tear us apart,

1005
01:36:09,388 --> 01:36:12,225
because this, this is our year!

1006
01:36:12,308 --> 01:36:13,726
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

1007
01:36:13,809 --> 01:36:15,019
Yeah!

1008
01:36:16,061 --> 01:36:16,813
Whoo!

1009
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:18,397
Whoo-hoo!

1010
01:36:25,821 --> 01:36:28,532
<i>♪ The bugle sounds, the charge begins ♪</i>

1011
01:36:29,033 --> 01:36:31,953
<i>♪ But on this battlefield, no one wins ♪</i>

1012
01:36:32,036 --> 01:36:34,914
<i>♪ The smell of acrid smoke
And horses' breath ♪</i>

1013
01:36:35,414 --> 01:36:37,708
<i>♪ As I plunge on into certain death ♪</i>

1014
01:36:40,002 --> 01:36:41,462
Whoo-hoo!

1015
01:36:43,255 --> 01:36:44,465
Settle down!

1016
01:36:45,466 --> 01:36:47,259
Back in your seats now!

1017
01:36:48,302 --> 01:36:51,055
Summer school for all of you!

1018
01:36:51,138 --> 01:36:52,765
And detention!

1019
01:37:09,615 --> 01:37:10,616
-Dustin!
-Dustin!

1020
01:37:10,699 --> 01:37:11,826
Dustin!

1021
01:37:13,911 --> 01:37:16,122
You're a madman.
You're an absolute madman.

1022
01:37:16,205 --> 01:37:19,167
-Higgins totally shit his pants.
-What's he gonna do, expel me?

1023
01:37:19,250 --> 01:37:20,876
-You're crazy.
-Hey.

1024
01:37:21,794 --> 01:37:23,379
Hey, Stacey.

1025
01:37:23,462 --> 01:37:26,215
I just wanted to say what you did up there
was pretty badass.

1026
01:37:26,298 --> 01:37:29,885
Oh. Thanks. I was kind of just going
for a bit of a Belushi thing.

1027
01:37:30,845 --> 01:37:32,597
But if he was in like a Hughes film.

1028
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:34,640
But I don't know. Does that make sense?

1029
01:37:34,723 --> 01:37:35,600
Yeah.

1030
01:37:35,683 --> 01:37:37,185
-That's okay if you...
-No, totally.

1031
01:37:37,268 --> 01:37:39,103
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

1032
01:37:41,063 --> 01:37:42,189
Okay. Cool.

1033
01:37:43,232 --> 01:37:44,859
-Why'd I say that?
-Dude...

1034
01:37:44,942 --> 01:37:48,821
Hey, so I'm having a party later tonight.

1035
01:37:49,363 --> 01:37:50,865
You guys should come.

1036
01:37:51,991 --> 01:37:53,826
-Wait.
-Did that just happen?

1037
01:37:53,909 --> 01:37:55,536
Should we go?

1038
01:37:55,619 --> 01:37:57,705
Is that rhetorical?

1039
01:37:58,205 --> 01:38:00,041
No. Screw that.

1040
01:38:00,124 --> 01:38:01,458
I got a better idea.

1041
01:38:02,001 --> 01:38:03,002
Way better.

1042
01:38:05,963 --> 01:38:08,883
{\an8}I'm just saying, I think
you guys would really dig New York.

1043
01:38:08,966 --> 01:38:10,510
{\an8}-Yeah.
-How much is rent?

1044
01:38:10,593 --> 01:38:13,304
{\an8}-Thinking about moving?
-You wanna come live with me?

1045
01:38:13,387 --> 01:38:14,972
{\an8}You're serious? Come on.

1046
01:38:15,055 --> 01:38:18,976
I mean, look at this place.
The sunset, the view.

1047
01:38:20,144 --> 01:38:21,353
Whoo!

1048
01:38:21,854 --> 01:38:24,440
You guys are seriously telling me
you don't miss any of this?

1049
01:38:24,523 --> 01:38:25,399
Mm.

1050
01:38:25,482 --> 01:38:26,609
No.

1051
01:38:26,692 --> 01:38:30,738
The forest, the quarry,
Family Video, the Hawk?

1052
01:38:30,821 --> 01:38:32,365
No.

1053
01:38:32,448 --> 01:38:35,284
No, I couldn't come back here
if you paid me a million bucks.

1054
01:38:35,367 --> 01:38:38,454
Mm. You'd need a lot less than a million,
I'll tell you that.

1055
01:38:38,537 --> 01:38:40,623
Prices are still way down.

1056
01:38:42,124 --> 01:38:44,335
There's actually this rad place
over in Forest Hills.

1057
01:38:44,418 --> 01:38:47,547
I can't quite afford it yet,
but I'm close.

1058
01:38:47,630 --> 01:38:49,715
And that is on a coach's salary.

1059
01:38:49,798 --> 01:38:51,801
-Don't forget sex ed teacher.
-That's true.

1060
01:38:51,884 --> 01:38:53,469
They have you teaching sex ed?

1061
01:38:54,053 --> 01:38:56,013
It's part of the gig.

1062
01:38:56,096 --> 01:38:59,225
If I had a question about an STD,
you'd be the first person I'd come to.

1063
01:38:59,308 --> 01:39:00,643
Thank you?

1064
01:39:02,061 --> 01:39:03,020
No, I love it.

1065
01:39:03,103 --> 01:39:04,939
I love teaching these kids, you know?

1066
01:39:05,022 --> 01:39:07,233
I get to teach them
about the miracle of life,

1067
01:39:07,316 --> 01:39:11,863
and how to not start it accidentally.

1068
01:39:11,946 --> 01:39:14,574
And this time,
I'm in control of the grades.

1069
01:39:14,657 --> 01:39:17,326
And why do I feel
like you go pretty easy there?

1070
01:39:17,409 --> 01:39:18,786
I have a strict A policy.

1071
01:39:18,869 --> 01:39:21,497
-Uh-huh.
-B, if you're a real knucklehead.

1072
01:39:21,580 --> 01:39:22,790
That's about as low as I go.

1073
01:39:22,873 --> 01:39:24,750
Hell, can you come and teach at NYU?

1074
01:39:25,876 --> 01:39:28,421
I mean, what, I'm gonna grade your movie

1075
01:39:28,504 --> 01:39:31,465
about capitalism,
cannibalism, or whatever?

1076
01:39:31,548 --> 01:39:33,718
No, it's anti-capitalist. <i>The Consumer.</i>

1077
01:39:33,801 --> 01:39:37,889
It's a metaphor. The more she eats,
the hungrier she gets.

1078
01:39:37,972 --> 01:39:39,265
-Right.
-Okay.

1079
01:39:39,348 --> 01:39:41,267
-Well, I mean, it's a working...
-Obviously.

1080
01:39:41,350 --> 01:39:43,769
-That's the working title.
-It's good.

1081
01:39:43,852 --> 01:39:45,270
Mm-hmm.

1082
01:39:46,397 --> 01:39:49,567
Now, Smith. Smith, I... I would consider.

1083
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:50,610
Oh, really?

1084
01:39:50,693 --> 01:39:53,112
Is it the lectures on Steinem
that draw you

1085
01:39:53,195 --> 01:39:55,114
or the high concentration of women?

1086
01:39:55,906 --> 01:39:58,033
Can't it be both?

1087
01:39:59,368 --> 01:40:00,786
What about you, Nance?

1088
01:40:00,869 --> 01:40:02,371
How are the babes at Emerson?

1089
01:40:02,955 --> 01:40:03,789
Oh, um...

1090
01:40:04,957 --> 01:40:06,041
I wouldn't know.

1091
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:09,086
I dropped out.

1092
01:40:09,670 --> 01:40:10,755
No way. What?

1093
01:40:10,838 --> 01:40:13,966
Ho, ho, ho! I knew it.
You became a Navy SEAL.

1094
01:40:14,049 --> 01:40:16,052
Oh no, not quite. I...

1095
01:40:16,135 --> 01:40:18,304
I took a job at the <i>Herald.</i>

1096
01:40:18,387 --> 01:40:21,974
Which... It sounds fancier like that.
It's a trainee position.

1097
01:40:22,057 --> 01:40:24,810
But I don't know.
I was just sick of school

1098
01:40:24,893 --> 01:40:30,858
and thought I'd maybe get out there
and... try the real world.

1099
01:40:32,776 --> 01:40:34,111
Nancy Wheeler.

1100
01:40:35,112 --> 01:40:36,405
Still full of surprises.

1101
01:40:42,161 --> 01:40:43,203
You know,

1102
01:40:44,621 --> 01:40:47,875
there actually is something
that I miss about this place.

1103
01:40:48,876 --> 01:40:50,002
I miss this.

1104
01:40:51,003 --> 01:40:51,920
Just...

1105
01:40:52,504 --> 01:40:53,672
us.

1106
01:40:54,298 --> 01:40:55,215
Hanging out.

1107
01:40:57,801 --> 01:40:58,969
I miss you guys.

1108
01:41:01,638 --> 01:41:03,140
I really like my new friends.

1109
01:41:04,933 --> 01:41:05,934
But it's...

1110
01:41:06,643 --> 01:41:08,103
It's not the same.

1111
01:41:11,398 --> 01:41:13,025
I don't think it ever will be.

1112
01:41:23,702 --> 01:41:25,036
Okay, Jesus.

1113
01:41:26,455 --> 01:41:27,832
You're killing me, man.

1114
01:41:27,915 --> 01:41:29,625
Let's do something about it.

1115
01:41:31,794 --> 01:41:33,212
I don't know. We could...

1116
01:41:34,463 --> 01:41:35,464
meet up.

1117
01:41:36,799 --> 01:41:38,050
Once a month, here.

1118
01:41:38,634 --> 01:41:42,972
Yeah, or... or maybe somewhere
just more neutral.

1119
01:41:43,055 --> 01:41:44,306
-Like...
-Okay.

1120
01:41:44,389 --> 01:41:48,227
What's a city between Hawkins,
and Massachusetts, New York?

1121
01:41:48,310 --> 01:41:49,394
Louisville.

1122
01:41:50,062 --> 01:41:51,230
-Uh, Philly.
-Philly.

1123
01:41:51,313 --> 01:41:54,358
I have an uncle who lives in Philly.
He's weird, but he's got a big house.

1124
01:41:54,441 --> 01:41:56,861
-Does it have a basement?
-Yeah.

1125
01:41:56,944 --> 01:41:58,738
-And a boiler room?
-A boiler room?

1126
01:41:58,821 --> 01:41:59,905
Yeah.

1127
01:42:00,030 --> 01:42:02,742
Oh my God, it's perfect.
You know, for the hideout.

1128
01:42:02,825 --> 01:42:05,996
You know, where she traps all the men
and then burns their bodies.

1129
01:42:06,912 --> 01:42:07,872
<i>-The Consumer.
-The Consumer.</i>

1130
01:42:07,955 --> 01:42:10,791
-What do you think I'm talking about?
-I thought you were trying to kill us.

1131
01:42:10,874 --> 01:42:11,876
Oh no.

1132
01:42:11,959 --> 01:42:17,214
Okay, okay. Yeah, so we'll meet
at Robin's weird uncle's house,

1133
01:42:17,297 --> 01:42:18,883
and we'll drink and reminisce

1134
01:42:18,966 --> 01:42:23,679
and make Jonathan's
anti-capitalist cannibal movie.

1135
01:42:25,139 --> 01:42:27,099
Starting next month.

1136
01:42:29,226 --> 01:42:30,144
Yeah, I'm in.

1137
01:42:32,020 --> 01:42:33,021
I'm in.

1138
01:42:37,401 --> 01:42:39,570
To nothing ever keeping us apart.

1139
01:42:41,113 --> 01:42:43,949
Including overbearing significant others.

1140
01:42:44,950 --> 01:42:46,076
School.

1141
01:42:46,910 --> 01:42:47,828
Mortgages.

1142
01:42:48,704 --> 01:42:49,538
And kids.

1143
01:42:50,706 --> 01:42:52,332
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

1144
01:42:58,422 --> 01:43:00,591
Yeah, Steve. Kids?

1145
01:43:00,674 --> 01:43:03,968
I don't know, guys.
I think Kristen might be the one.

1146
01:43:06,555 --> 01:43:09,475
So, didn't you say the same thing
about Dawn?

1147
01:43:09,558 --> 01:43:10,893
-No.
-And Margaret.

1148
01:43:10,976 --> 01:43:11,852
And Julie.

1149
01:43:11,935 --> 01:43:15,022
I did not say that about Julie.
She was drama from the start.

1150
01:43:15,105 --> 01:43:16,023
Drama?

1151
01:43:16,523 --> 01:43:18,651
Like, is she a good actor?

1152
01:43:18,734 --> 01:43:19,985
Yeah, you do not wanna...

1153
01:43:20,068 --> 01:43:21,153
I mean, I'm looking.

1154
01:43:21,236 --> 01:43:23,906
-No, no, no. Not there.
-Yeah, have her come along.

1155
01:43:47,179 --> 01:43:51,392
Chief. Mrs. Byers. Always a pleasure.

1156
01:43:51,475 --> 01:43:52,977
Are we ready to order?

1157
01:43:53,060 --> 01:43:54,478
Uh, yeah.

1158
01:43:54,561 --> 01:44:00,150
Yeah. We're gonna have a bottle
of the Cabernet Sauv...

1159
01:44:00,943 --> 01:44:03,654
-Sauvignon.
-Yeah. Cabernet Sauvignon.

1160
01:44:03,737 --> 01:44:07,283
And we'll have some caviar to start.

1161
01:44:07,366 --> 01:44:10,661
And we will have
two of the fillet specials,

1162
01:44:10,744 --> 01:44:13,038
however the chef would like
to prepare them.

1163
01:44:13,538 --> 01:44:14,915
-Very good, sir.
-Okay.

1164
01:44:14,998 --> 01:44:16,250
-Hop!
-What?

1165
01:44:16,333 --> 01:44:19,628
It's a big day.
It's a once-in-a-lifetime day.

1166
01:44:20,379 --> 01:44:23,549
You raised two beautiful boys
into incredible men.

1167
01:44:23,632 --> 01:44:26,593
They had a lot more to overcome
than just puberty.

1168
01:44:27,386 --> 01:44:28,637
You should be happy.

1169
01:44:30,555 --> 01:44:32,057
You should be proud.

1170
01:44:32,683 --> 01:44:33,976
I am, but...

1171
01:44:34,643 --> 01:44:35,727
It's just...

1172
01:44:36,353 --> 01:44:37,813
It's gonna be quiet in that cabin.

1173
01:44:37,896 --> 01:44:39,940
It's just us and the crickets.

1174
01:44:40,023 --> 01:44:44,445
Ugh, the crickets. Yeah. I don't like
the sound of those crickets anymore.

1175
01:44:44,528 --> 01:44:45,529
Thank you.

1176
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:47,448
I wish, uh...

1177
01:44:47,531 --> 01:44:49,658
I wish it was the sound
of something different.

1178
01:44:49,741 --> 01:44:52,786
Maybe, um, squawk of seagulls

1179
01:44:52,869 --> 01:44:57,166
or, uh, waves gently lapping on the beach.

1180
01:44:57,249 --> 01:45:00,294
Well, that sounds nice.

1181
01:45:01,295 --> 01:45:02,296
Could be real.

1182
01:45:05,173 --> 01:45:07,968
I'm just saying there's nothing
tying us down here anymore.

1183
01:45:08,051 --> 01:45:12,348
But you seem to think
our bank account is bigger than it is.

1184
01:45:12,431 --> 01:45:13,265
Could be.

1185
01:45:13,348 --> 01:45:15,643
I got a call from my buddy
in the New York days.

1186
01:45:15,726 --> 01:45:17,824
Montauk's looking
for a new chief of police.

1187
01:45:18,603 --> 01:45:21,732
Town's up and coming. It'd be 20% more.

1188
01:45:21,815 --> 01:45:23,984
I know that's not big enough
for a mansion or anything,

1189
01:45:24,067 --> 01:45:26,278
but it's... significant.

1190
01:45:26,361 --> 01:45:29,948
Kids would be closer.
Just a little quick trip into the city.

1191
01:45:30,449 --> 01:45:31,450
You and me?

1192
01:45:32,659 --> 01:45:33,910
We could start again.

1193
01:45:34,453 --> 01:45:35,454
Fresh.

1194
01:45:36,705 --> 01:45:37,539
Together.

1195
01:45:37,622 --> 01:45:39,041
Are you kidding?

1196
01:45:39,124 --> 01:45:40,834
We don't have to figure out
anything tonight.

1197
01:45:40,917 --> 01:45:43,063
We don't have to decide
anything, but, um...

1198
01:45:45,505 --> 01:45:46,882
That's not true.

1199
01:45:46,965 --> 01:45:47,924
What...?

1200
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:52,596
There's one thing
I would like to decide tonight.

1201
01:46:04,983 --> 01:46:05,942
Who's...?

1202
01:46:13,450 --> 01:46:16,870

1217
01:47:43,165 --> 01:47:46,335
The sound of boots echo across the square

1218
01:47:46,418 --> 01:47:49,338
as Strahd von Zarovich strides up
to Dustin the Bard.

1219
01:47:49,421 --> 01:47:51,006
-Don't do this.
-The vampire lord lunges.

1220
01:47:51,089 --> 01:47:52,841
-No!
-Plunging its fangs into his throat.

1221
01:47:52,924 --> 01:47:55,094
Onlookers gasp as his body collapses.

1222
01:47:55,177 --> 01:47:59,264
His lute clatters across the cobblestone,
letting out a final mournful note.

1223
01:47:59,347 --> 01:48:00,307
Son of a bitch!

1224
01:48:00,390 --> 01:48:04,686
A lone hero remains, Will the Wise,
Barovia's last and only hope.

1225
01:48:04,769 --> 01:48:07,356
Cast Meteor Swarm. Take out the bastard.

1226
01:48:07,439 --> 01:48:08,732
-I can't.
-Why not?

1227
01:48:08,815 --> 01:48:10,943
He's in the range
of the suppression stone. No magic.

1228
01:48:11,026 --> 01:48:12,778
Then just whack him with your staff.

1229
01:48:12,861 --> 01:48:15,864
And inflict six points of damage.
He has 30 HP left.

1230
01:48:17,782 --> 01:48:18,867
Okay, so now what?

1231
01:48:18,950 --> 01:48:21,786
-That's it.
-Nothing.

1232
01:48:22,370 --> 01:48:23,638
What do you mean, nothing?

1233
01:48:25,081 --> 01:48:26,542
-Checkmate.
-We lost.

1234
01:48:26,625 --> 01:48:30,962
So after all of that,
Strahd von Douchebag just wins?

1235
01:48:31,963 --> 01:48:34,758
-This game is bullshit!
-I agree.

1236
01:48:34,841 --> 01:48:37,678
Stupid, goddamn waste of time!

1237
01:48:37,761 --> 01:48:40,763
Strahd takes
great pleasure in your anger.

1238
01:48:44,643 --> 01:48:47,104
Time to join your friends, sorcerer.

1239
01:48:47,187 --> 01:48:50,315
Just get it over with and roll.
I don't wanna hear his shit anymore.

1240
01:48:50,398 --> 01:48:51,483
All right.

1241
01:48:56,196 --> 01:49:00,450
The mage. From the Abbey of St. Markovia.
She said we can summon her.

1242
01:49:01,493 --> 01:49:02,713
When at our lowest depth.

1243
01:49:03,286 --> 01:49:05,539
The incantation to summon her.
What's the incantation?

1244
01:49:05,622 --> 01:49:08,208
-What is the incantation?
-Will! Will!

1245
01:49:08,291 --> 01:49:12,713
"Oh, mage! Arise and end our fall
from darkened paths and secrets deep."

1246
01:49:12,796 --> 01:49:15,382
"Come forth and help your promise keep."

1247
01:49:17,259 --> 01:49:18,177
Nothing happens.

1248
01:49:18,260 --> 01:49:20,012
-Come on, man.
-Why?

1249
01:49:20,095 --> 01:49:21,889
Then why do we even have the incantation?

1250
01:49:21,972 --> 01:49:23,307
-What?
-Wait.

1251
01:49:23,390 --> 01:49:24,516
Wait, wait.

1252
01:49:25,141 --> 01:49:27,603
A purple light begins to shine
through the mist.

1253
01:49:27,686 --> 01:49:29,854
Growing brighter and brighter.

1254
01:49:31,064 --> 01:49:31,982
It's a portal.

1255
01:49:33,233 --> 01:49:35,151
And out of this portal steps...

1256
01:49:35,777 --> 01:49:37,821
the Mage of St. Markovia!

1257
01:49:42,576 --> 01:49:46,788
The mage holds out her hands, and shoom,
a beam of powerful light shoots forward.

1258
01:49:46,871 --> 01:49:48,832
Strahd lets out a piercing...

1259
01:49:48,915 --> 01:49:52,669
...as his body shrivels, burns,
and turns to ash.

1260
01:49:54,045 --> 01:49:55,922
Bada-boom!

1261
01:49:56,506 --> 01:49:58,883
How do you like that?

1262
01:49:59,801 --> 01:50:01,469
Whoo!

1263
01:50:02,178 --> 01:50:05,057
The misty gloom that shrouds the village
of Barovia evaporates,

1264
01:50:05,140 --> 01:50:07,351
and you are met
with cheers from the townsfolk.

1265
01:50:07,434 --> 01:50:10,187
In honor of your courage and bravery,
they give you medals,

1266
01:50:10,270 --> 01:50:13,314
and you are all awarded
1,000 pieces of gold each.

1267
01:50:15,317 --> 01:50:16,443
Flush with wealth and honor,

1268
01:50:16,526 --> 01:50:19,613
you live out the rest of your lives
in comfort and in happiness.

1269
01:50:19,696 --> 01:50:21,698
Aaaaah!

1270
01:50:21,781 --> 01:50:23,242
The end.

1271
01:50:23,325 --> 01:50:25,536
-Great campaign.
-Good campaign, buddy.

1272
01:50:25,619 --> 01:50:26,661
Great campaign.

1273
01:50:27,829 --> 01:50:30,040
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. That's it?

1274
01:50:30,123 --> 01:50:33,961
Comfort and happiness?
Could you be more trite?

1275
01:50:34,044 --> 01:50:37,117
I thought you were some kind
of master storyteller or something.

1276
01:50:37,297 --> 01:50:39,090
Oh.

1277
01:50:44,721 --> 01:50:47,849
Well, it is true,
the comfort and happiness part.

1278
01:50:48,850 --> 01:50:51,353
But happiness can be found in many places.

1279
01:50:52,562 --> 01:50:55,148
The knight and the zoomer,

1280
01:50:55,982 --> 01:50:59,152
they retire from battle,
and they settle down in a small village.

1281
01:51:01,029 --> 01:51:02,656
<i>With each passing day,</i>

1282
01:51:03,531 --> 01:51:05,200
<i>their love grows stronger.</i>

1283
01:51:17,879 --> 01:51:18,880
The bard,

1284
01:51:19,381 --> 01:51:20,632
craving knowledge,

1285
01:51:20,715 --> 01:51:23,385
makes his way
to the Mage's Guild of Enclave,

1286
01:51:23,468 --> 01:51:26,304
<i>where he spends his days
in their vast library.</i>

1287
01:51:27,180 --> 01:51:30,851
<i>-Though deeply devoted to his studies...</i>
-Hey, buddy.

1288
01:51:30,934 --> 01:51:33,422
<i>...he still makes time
for the occasional adventure.</i>

1289
01:51:46,408 --> 01:51:47,576
As for Will the Wise,

1290
01:51:47,659 --> 01:51:52,163
he travels far and long
to the bustling city of Vallaki.

1291
01:51:53,039 --> 01:51:54,791
It's overwhelming at first.

1292
01:51:55,333 --> 01:51:58,628
<i>So very different
from the village where he spent his youth.</i>

1293
01:51:59,754 --> 01:52:01,923
<i>But it isn't long
before he finds his place there.</i>

1294
01:52:02,006 --> 01:52:02,841
Hey!

1295
01:52:02,924 --> 01:52:05,719
<i>And with that, deep happiness</i>

1296
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:07,971
<i>and acceptance.</i>

1297
01:52:15,061 --> 01:52:18,273
And the storyteller? What about him?

1298
01:52:21,317 --> 01:52:24,612
The storyteller keeps telling stories,

1299
01:52:25,905 --> 01:52:27,615
stories inspired by his friends.

1300
01:52:31,077 --> 01:52:32,621
<i>One day, he hopes</i>

1301
01:52:32,704 --> 01:52:36,583
<i>their tales of grand adventure
will spread far and wide across the land</i>

1302
01:52:37,459 --> 01:52:39,836
<i>so all can know of their great bravery.</i>

1303
01:52:42,130 --> 01:52:45,467
But there is a story
that he can never tell.

1304
01:52:47,427 --> 01:52:48,803
The story of the mage.

1305
01:52:50,638 --> 01:52:52,682
Or at least not the real story.

1306
01:52:54,350 --> 01:52:55,560
The real story?

1307
01:52:59,272 --> 01:53:00,524
When she cast Sunbeam.

1308
01:53:00,607 --> 01:53:01,858
Get off me!

1309
01:53:04,152 --> 01:53:05,111
Goodbye, Mike.

1310
01:53:06,946 --> 01:53:09,991
She expended the last of her energy,
and she vanished.

1311
01:53:10,074 --> 01:53:11,910
El!

1312
01:53:14,329 --> 01:53:17,012
But has anyone asked themselves
how she cast that spell?

1313
01:53:18,833 --> 01:53:20,502
The suppression stone.

1314
01:53:21,085 --> 01:53:22,878
She couldn't have used her magic.

1315
01:53:26,591 --> 01:53:28,635
In the excitement, no one even noticed.

1316
01:53:29,886 --> 01:53:31,930
But you see, the mage is very clever.

1317
01:53:32,430 --> 01:53:34,599
A cleverness only matched by her sister,

1318
01:53:34,682 --> 01:53:37,477
<i>who, upon hearing the pleads
of the paladin,</i>

1319
01:53:38,394 --> 01:53:39,854
<i>had a change of heart.</i>

1320
01:53:40,438 --> 01:53:41,815
Don't cry, Jane.

1321
01:53:42,357 --> 01:53:43,650
My story...

1322
01:53:44,317 --> 01:53:46,402
was always going to end here.

1323
01:53:50,240 --> 01:53:51,783
But yours doesn't have to.

1324
01:53:53,952 --> 01:53:56,621
Together, the sisters devised a plan,

1325
01:53:57,121 --> 01:53:59,833
a plan to protect the mage
from the Order of the Black Hand,

1326
01:53:59,916 --> 01:54:02,127
<i>who remained hell-bent
on stealing her powers.</i>

1327
01:54:02,210 --> 01:54:05,630
So in order to trick them,
she had to make everyone,

1328
01:54:05,713 --> 01:54:09,175
including her friends,
believe that she was dead.

1329
01:54:09,926 --> 01:54:12,637
And so the sister cast a spell
from far away.

1330
01:54:13,638 --> 01:54:15,849
<i>Safe from the power
of the suppression stone.</i>

1331
01:54:15,932 --> 01:54:18,226
El! Do you see El?

1332
01:54:20,603 --> 01:54:22,105
<i>A spell of invisibility.</i>

1333
01:54:32,365 --> 01:54:35,994
<i>Once the mage escaped,
the sister cast one final spell.</i>

1334
01:54:43,877 --> 01:54:46,379
<i>The mage you saw die was not real.</i>

1335
01:54:48,006 --> 01:54:49,424
<i>She was an illusion.</i>

1336
01:54:54,178 --> 01:54:55,347
Where did she go?

1337
01:54:55,430 --> 01:54:56,639
No one knows.

1338
01:54:57,974 --> 01:54:59,047
No one will ever know.

1339
01:55:00,059 --> 01:55:05,899
But I'd... I'd like to imagine that she's
in a beautiful land, somewhere far away.

1340
01:55:31,633 --> 01:55:34,052
<i>She finds a small town to call home.</i>

1341
01:55:35,762 --> 01:55:38,306
<i>Safe from the danger of the Black Hand.</i>

1342
01:55:40,183 --> 01:55:41,309
<i>And it is here,</i>

1343
01:55:41,392 --> 01:55:42,727
at last,

1344
01:55:43,853 --> 01:55:44,979
that she finds peace.

1345
01:55:46,689 --> 01:55:48,650
That she finally finds happiness.

1346
01:55:49,776 --> 01:55:52,070
And this is just a theory, right?

1347
01:55:52,946 --> 01:55:54,280
How do we know it's true?

1348
01:55:55,823 --> 01:55:56,783
We don't.

1349
01:55:59,744 --> 01:56:01,037
Not for sure.

1350
01:56:03,414 --> 01:56:05,500
But I choose to believe that it is.

1351
01:56:07,085 --> 01:56:08,211
I believe.

1352
01:56:10,463 --> 01:56:11,464
I believe.

1353
01:56:13,925 --> 01:56:15,385
I believe.

1354
01:56:16,803 --> 01:56:17,971
I believe.

1355
01:56:19,389 --> 01:56:20,473
I believe.

1356
01:56:24,978 --> 01:56:28,356
Guys! What's going on?
The lasagna's getting cold!

1357
01:56:28,439 --> 01:56:31,734
Yeah, we... we just finished.
We'll be right up.

1358
01:57:54,859 --> 01:57:57,320
-Holly, how do we play this game?
-Jesus, watch out!

1359
01:57:57,403 --> 01:58:00,156
Jeez yourself!
You said you'd be done an hour ago!

1360
01:58:00,239 --> 01:58:01,866
Look, it's our own little castle.

1361
01:58:01,949 --> 01:58:04,869
I'll look in the manual
for like a starter campaign in here.

1362
01:58:04,952 --> 01:58:06,329
Why do you get to be Dungeon Master?

1363
01:58:06,412 --> 01:58:08,289
Because this was my idea,
and this is my house!

1364
01:58:08,372 --> 01:58:10,125
You told me
this was not going to be nerdy!

1365
01:58:10,208 --> 01:58:11,459
-This is super nerdy!
-Put him down!

1366
01:58:11,542 --> 01:58:13,044
-Did you just fart?
-No.

1367
01:58:13,711 --> 01:58:15,171
Something smells. I'm gonna puke.

1368
01:58:15,254 --> 01:58:16,339
It's just old pizza.

1369
01:58:16,422 --> 01:58:18,675
Old pizza doesn't smell like crusty ass!

1370
01:58:18,758 --> 01:58:19,968
Blame it on the girls.

1371
01:58:20,051 --> 01:58:22,887
Excuse me, girls don't fart.
If they do, it smells like roses.

1372
01:58:22,970 --> 01:58:23,888
Listen to Holly!

1373
01:58:23,971 --> 01:58:25,974
-You get these back when you focus!
-I can't see!

1374
01:58:26,057 --> 01:58:28,601
Okay! You can be a halfling! A halfling!

1375
01:58:28,684 --> 01:58:31,021
You want me to walk around like this
and fall over?

1376
01:58:31,104 --> 01:58:33,690
No, you're sitting down
and focusing!

1377
01:58:33,773 --> 01:58:35,858
Give me my glasses back!
