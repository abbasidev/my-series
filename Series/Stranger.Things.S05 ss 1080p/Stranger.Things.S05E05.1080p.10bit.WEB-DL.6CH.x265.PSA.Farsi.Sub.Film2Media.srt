It is because they are weak.

I don't understand. How did you...?

An evil darkness is spreading
across not just Hawkins,

but the whole world,

54
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:40,553
and soon it will be too late to stop it.

55
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:44,849
You can think of this darkness
like the Black Thing in your book.

56
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,102
Just as the Black Thing
threatened Meg's family,

57
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,770
so does the darkness threaten yours,

58
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:52,190

to defeat this darkness.

59
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:53,483
How?

60
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:59,530
I have traveled far and long
beyond our dimension.

61
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:02,784
In my travels, I discovered another world.

62
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,245
A world far from Earth.

63
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:08,998
This world is much like ours, only...

64
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:10,708
good.

65
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,294
Free of monsters and darkness.

66
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:15,838
It is the light.

67
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:19,717
Which brings me to the true reason
why you have been chosen.

68
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:20,760
You...

69
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,263
are not like other children.

70
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:26,057
Like Meg, you are special.

71
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,060
You have dormant powers in here.

72
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:33,940
And I believe if we work together,
we can awaken those powers,

73
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:37,193
channel our energy
and draw this new world to ours.

74
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,820
And as the light...

75
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,781
reaches the darkness,

76
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,117
the light will expel the darkness,

77
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,036
your loved ones will be saved, and you...

83

But you get what I'm saying,
though, right?

Like, this totally changes the game.

137
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,120
We got our second El.

I don't have powers.

139

I'm just... I'm siphoning.
I'm stealing Vecna's.

140
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,461
And to do that,
I have to be near the hive mind,

141
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:48,880
and Vecna's not coming back.

142
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:51,048
-But his Demos might.
-I don't think so.

143
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,259
They came for the kids,
and he's got them all,

144
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,177
and he has his vessels.

145
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:00,725
"Vessels"?

146
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:06,147
That's what he called them. He said,
"vessels for reshaping the world."

147
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,190
I just hope your theory's wrong.

148
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,026
What theory?

149
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,069
November 6th.

150
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,989
The day all this started...

151
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:17,742
is the day it ends.

I got you. I got you.

[groaning in pain]

155
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,803
[Mike] Come on, man. One more step.

156
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,971
Hey, hey. Come here.

157
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,894
I wonder if there's a way
we can jack back into the hive mind

158
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,604
and access his powers again.

159
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,439
That's not possible, not unless...

160
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:50,691
The hive is close, I know.

161
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,610
But what happened tonight,

162
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,737
none of us thought
that was possible either.

163
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,821
Mom.

164
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,991
Listen, I'm just saying, what if...

165
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,201
what if this time,

166
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:02,828
you don't use your powers
against his army.

167
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:06,666
You use them against him, against Vecna.

168
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,668
Stab him with his own sword.

169
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,878
You didn't fail tonight.

170
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,214
What you did...

171
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:16,133
was extraordinary.

172
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,761
You said so yourself.

173
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:22,431
Vecna chose you
because he underestimated you.

174
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:25,476
I think we all have. I know I did.

175
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:29,563
And that is a mistake
I will never, ever make again.

176
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:33,651
But I'm willing to bet everything
that he does.

177
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,319
And when he does,

Precisely.

348
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,895
The human mind needs energy and nutrients
to sustain focus and creativity.

349
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:30,938
Hmm?

350
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:32,606
Eat.

351
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,785
[popping]

352
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,331
[slurping loudly]

353
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:05,264
-I got it! I got it!
-I got it! I got it. I got it.

354
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,932
Okay, I'll go first.

355
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:11,812
Dustin is MIA, but his mentor... is not.

356
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:14,356
-Mr. Clarke?
-He's the biggest nerd in Hawkins.

357
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,233
He taught Dustin everything he knows.

358
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:19,486
If anyone can build a new tracker,
and build one fast, it's him.

359
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:20,946
That could work.

360
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,699
Yeah, but that'll just take time.

361
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:27,327
My plan is faster, bolder, better.

362
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:31,915
As I was heating up my popcorn,
I thought about Billy in the sauna.

363
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:35,627
We heated him up
to activate the particles, right?

364
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:38,547
They were dormant,
just like these kernels,

365
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,717
just like the particles
inside the Demos Will killed.

366
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,844
To bring 'em back to life,
we have to heat 'em up.

367
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:46,805
There are 50,000 watts flowing
through that tower.

368
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,473
[electrical hum powering down]

369
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:52,311
We pump the dead Demos with electricity,
shock those particles back to life,

370
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:56,440
and voilà,
we've got ourselves an instant hive mind.

371
00:21:56,523 --> 00:22:00,068
You want to Dr. Frankenstein a dead Demo?
That's your big idea?

372
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,571
-Your plan is slow as shit.
-Your plan is stupid as shit.

373
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,489
Hey, hey, children, stop it!

374
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:05,866
Let's be clear.

375
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:09,578
They each have flaws.
Many, many, many flaws.

376
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,288
So we try both.

377
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:14,875
We throw two darts
and pray for a bullseye.

378
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,850
Okay, that was too many stairs.

379
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:36,646
Treasures are always hidden
in the deepest depths of the dungeon.

380
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:41,568
What is it, a treasure
or a magic shield generator?

381
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:43,779
Keep your metaphors straight, dude.

382
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,322
Analogy.

383
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,125
[Steve] Okay.

384
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:01,338
Did not expect to find a daycare
in this hellhole.

385
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:02,547
That's a perk.

386
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:06,468
[laughs] Holy shit, Henderson.

387
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:07,594
You were right.

388
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,099
Treasure.

389
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,228
-Okay, you know what?
-What?

390
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:19,231
This is the perfect spot for you,
considering your arrested development.

391
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:20,816
While I search the rest of the basement,

392
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,985
why don't you stay here
and play with your balls?

393
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,277
Perfect, yeah.

394
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:26,863
-Finally, a plan I can get behind.
-I can imagine.

395
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:29,574
Yeah, good luck
looking for your... treasure.

396
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:30,992
I mean, shield generator.

397
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,744
I mean, made-up bullshit.

398
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:33,870
Thank you.

399
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:37,618
[Jonathan] <i>I'm starting to worry
Dustin might be wrong this time.</i>

400
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,420
I mean, this place is dead.

401
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:46,716
I dunno. The whole thing
just seems... increasingly unlikely.

402
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:48,718
Well, we're here now.

403
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,721
Might as well search the place.

404
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:54,808
[Jonathan sighs]

405
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,020
Hey.

406
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:02,774
Did I do something...

407
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,444
to piss you off or something?

408
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,154
What are you talking about?

409
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:08,614
I don't know. There's a tone.

410
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,073
-A tone?
-Yeah.

411
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:12,909
-Okay.
-See, that was it. The tone.

412
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:18,248
Yeah, well, now there's a tone
because you're being ridiculous.

413
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:22,544
Yeah, well, was I being ridiculous
downstairs also?

414
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:26,506
Oh, you mean when you and Steve
started up your macho crap again?

415
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:31,052
Wait, no, you mean when Steve asked you
to go with him, and you hesitated.

416
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:34,598
Um, actually, I said
we should stick to the usual.

417
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:36,933
Yeah, after you hesitated.

418
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,268
I didn't hesitate.

419
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:40,187
I know you, Nancy. You hesitated.

420
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:44,399
Okay. So what if I did, which I didn't?

421
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,109
It doesn't matter.

422
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:48,111
My sister is missing.

423
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,822
Yeah, which is exactly why it does matter.

424
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,867
After everything that has happened,

425
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,285
that is happening,

426
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:57,579
I'm scared, Nancy, okay?

427
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,414
I'm really scared.

428
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,501
I don't know
what's on the other side of any of this.

429
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,127
But what I do know

430
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,963
is that if we wanna stand a chance
of surviving this,

431
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,757
all right, we need to be a team.

432
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,383
A team like we used to be.

433
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,969
We are still a team.

434
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,054
No, we're not.

435
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,306
Not anymore.

436
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:20,769
So, what, you wanna solve
all of our relationship issues here?

437
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:24,231
-In Hawkins Lab? In the Upside Down?
-No. No, Nancy.

438
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:27,359
I just want you
to stop running away from me.

439
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:29,528
Start being honest with me.

440
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,404
Oh, and that's what you've been?

441
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:33,698
Honest with me?

442
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:36,660
Yeah.

443
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:39,120
Yeah, I've been honest with you.

444
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,039
-You hesitated.
-No, I didn't.

445
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:44,537
I know you, Jonathan, and that hesitation
was the size of a Mack Truck.

446
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:48,463
[emotional music builds]

447
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,501
[grunting]

448
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,557
What are you doing?

449
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:42,183
Jonathan!

450
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,230
What the hell?

451
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:49,608
[Nancy] What is it?

452
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,862
Is it too late to take back what I said
about Dustin's theory?

453
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:04,998
[Hopper] <i>Nancy, Jonathan,
do you copy? Over.</i>

454
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:10,128
We are at the church, and we are wondering
where the hell you are.

455
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:11,254
You copy?

456
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:14,215
Jonathan!

457
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:17,260
Nancy, do you copy?

458
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:19,429
Come on, guys.

459
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:22,097
[Kali] <i>After you
and your policeman came all this way,</i>

460
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:26,478
it must have been quite the surprise
finding me instead of Henry.

461
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:27,937
[Eleven] I'm sorry, Kali.

462
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:31,066
I'm sorry for not finding you sooner.

463
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,026
You couldn't have known.

464
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:36,738
I have a bath, a tank at home.

465
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:41,368
I can search far, even here.

466
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:46,122
I think I was afraid to look for you.

467
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,542
How much did you know about Henry?

468
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:52,337
Everything, except...

469
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:56,424
that he was still alive.

470
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,260
Help me find him.

471
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:01,429
Kill him.

472
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:02,472
Then what?

473
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:04,182
It ends.

474
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:06,935
We can finally live. We can really live.

475
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,520
That's just a dream, Jane.

476
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:10,105
It doesn't have to be.

477
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:14,734
I had the same... dream.

478
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:17,696
That I could put a stop to all this,

479
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,490
that I could...

480
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:24,327
heal our wound.

481
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:32,711
<i>But they found me.</i>

482
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,797
<i>Found my friends.</i>

483
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,965
No!

484
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:38,508
They killed them.

485
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,469
And they took me.

486
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,139
[dramatic music playing]

487
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:28,099
[Kali] <i>I didn't understand
why I was still alive.</i>

488
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:33,104
<i>I thought maybe this doctor
was hired to torture me.</i>

489
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:35,440
But this was not about revenge.

490
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:39,110
<i>Dr. Kay needed me.</i>

491
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:41,905
<i>She needed my blood.</i>

492
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,784
And her need was endless.

493
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,123
<i>She just kept taking...</i>

494
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:54,459
<i>and taking.</i>

495
00:29:55,293 --> 00:30:00,381
<i>And I began to think of her
as a kind of vampire.</i>

496
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:06,638
I don't know how long I was there.
They had me drugged.

497
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:09,808
All I knew was I needed to get out.

498
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,185
And the only way out...

499
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,187
was death.

500
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:21,903
Dr. Kay thought she had stopped my tricks

501
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:26,366
with that... awful sound of hers.

502
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:35,041
But not all tricks require powers.

503
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:36,334
[gasping]

504
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:47,345
[lock beeps]

505
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:50,974
If I had known
what was on the other side of that door,

506
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:53,935
I never would have left.

507
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,823
[girl] We thought of that.
He must've made it.

508
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:08,825
-[boy] What were they doing?
-I was playing...

509
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:10,076
Go away, dipshit!

510
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,161
You read my mind, numb nuts!

511
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:16,374
Derek, what are you doing?
You're not allowed to go in the woods.

512
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:17,459
It's against the rules.

513
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:21,254
According to who, Mr. Rogers?
He can suck my fat one!

514
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:25,925
-Mr. Whatsit!
-Mr. Whatsit!

515
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:28,303
-Derek went in the woods!
-Mr. Whatsit!

516
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:35,768
[Holly] <i>What if Henry catches Derek?</i>

517
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:38,313
You think he'll hurt him? Or worse?

518
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,690
As long as Derek makes it to the cave,
he's safe.

519
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:42,400
We just need Henry to take the bait.

520
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:45,570
How long is it gonna take
to find the exit?

521
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:46,988
Let's hope not long.

522
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,825
Right, it's just you had your friend Kate
to guide you, and...

523
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:53,203
All I've been doing for the past two years
is moving through this maze.

524
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:54,454
I'm all the guide we need.

525
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:56,331
Once we find his first memory of you,

526
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,667
we follow the memory trail
to the night he captured you.

527
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:02,253
And if I'm right,
the exit to the real world will be there.

528
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,547
And then we escape Camazotz.

529
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:06,633
Then we escape Camazotz.

530
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:10,511
[Robin straining]

531
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,060
[drill whirring]

532
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,485
Hey, so, um, I realize,

533
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:27,737
and I know
that I've waited just long enough

534
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,137
to make this super awkward,

535
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,700
but I never thanked you
for saving my life,

536
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:36,120
which is, you know,
kind of, sort of a big deal.

537
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,205
Especially to me.

538
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,957
[both chuckle]

539
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,166
You're welcome.

540
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:43,211
I... I... I mean, I
should be thanking you.

541
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,588
Thanking me? Why?

542
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:49,634
For talking to me about Tammy
and... and your life.

543
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:51,678
It was... It was so...

544
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:53,262
helpful.

545
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:55,723
Me? Talking?

546
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:57,934
Helpful?

547
00:32:58,017 --> 00:32:59,894
Someone should really tell my mother.

548
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:03,356
So...

549
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:10,613
after... after this Tammy
and this whole tape epiphany,

550
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:13,783
is that when you and Vickie started to...

551
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:15,159
No, no, no. Um...

552
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:19,288
I mean, I never would have had the guts
to talk to Vic back then.

553
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:21,499
I was finally cool with myself,

554
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:24,669
but sharing that part of myself with

555
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,801
someone else,
that was a whole other thing.

556
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:28,965
But eventually, I...

557
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:32,719
I did it. You know, I told someone.

558
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:35,930
Looks like we're all set.

559
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:38,516
[Will] But...

560
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:40,351
Wait.

561
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:44,313
-But... But who did you tell?
-Oh. The obvious. Steve.

562
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:46,274
Wait, what?

563
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:50,528
Robin, I... I mean, I don't understand.
I mean, not the same...

564
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:52,697
As in your Steve, like Steve...

565
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,491
Steve "The Hair" Harrington,
my once sworn enemy.

566
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:58,953
All right, watch out!

567
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,999
[electricity crackling]

568
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:05,334
That's good!

569
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:11,549
But wait, Robin. I mean, I like Steve.
I just... I don't understand. He seems...

570
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:13,092
Like a bonkers choice?

571
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:15,303
-Yeah.
-Believe me, I know.

572
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:18,640
To be fair, we had just been injected
with truth serum by evil Russians,

573
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:21,267
which is kind of like liquid courage
on steroids.

574
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,561
Really, drugs or not,

575
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:28,608
just saying it out loud to someone
and hearing him be cool with it, you know?

576
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:30,359
It's like this weight lifted.

577
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:34,072
And, you know,
if I hadn't have told Steve,

578
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:37,325
then I probably wouldn't have had
the courage to open up to Vickie about it,

579
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,536
and probably wouldn't be talking
to you about it either.

580
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:42,121
You know, you're only
audience member number three.

581
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:44,499
I'm hoping to double my audience
by the end of this year,

582
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:48,586
but that's only if you out-sorcerer
the sorcerer, and we don't all die.

583
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:49,921
[both exhale]

584
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:55,134
You don't by any chance
have any of that truth serum left, do you?

585
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:57,303
-[Robin laughs]
-[crackling increases]

586
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:58,387
Holy shit!

587
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,100
Step back!

588
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:10,024
This is it. This is where I woke up.

589
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:13,986
Good. So, look for anything
that's out of place.

590
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,447
It'll be hidden. Hard to find, but...

591
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:18,533
There.

592
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,493
[Max] Oh.

593
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:22,537
Or not hard.

594
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:27,583
[mysterious music playing]

595
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:43,724
-[roaring]
-[girls screaming]

596
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:47,895
It's just a memory.
Whatever's down there, it can't hurt you.

597
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:55,111
[screaming continues]

598
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:58,406
[door slams]

599
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,999
[creaking on TV]

600
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:12,044
[electricity on TV crackling]

601
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:17,216
I don't understand. This was Halloween.

602
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,051
I hadn't met Henry yet.

603
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:21,596
Just because you didn't see him
doesn't mean he wasn't here.

604
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:22,930
[thunder crashes]

605
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:29,687
Hey, remember...

606
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:30,813
Just a memory.

607
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:31,898
Mm-hmm.

608
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:40,448
There should be another memory close by.

609
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,394
Do you know
when you first actually met Henry?

610
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,372
Holly, I need you to focus, okay?
When did you first meet him?

611
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,583
After school, I think.

612
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:52,585
Okay, where at school exactly?

613
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:54,503
The library.

614
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,214
Library.

615
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,720
[woman on TV] <i>I used to
live in this house.</i>

616
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:25,201
Bingo.

617
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,708
[Henry] I absolutely adore that book.

618
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:35,670
Hello.

619
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:38,089
My name is Henry.

620
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:39,715
What's yours?

621
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,599
Come on, man.

622
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:51,852
Piece of shit.

623
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:58,234
-Really? You're actually playing in here?
-I'm just following orders, dude.

624
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:01,154
Judging by your pissy look, I assume
you didn't find the shield generator.

625
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,114
-It's here somewhere.
-But you didn't find it.

626
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:04,365
Yeah, not on this floor.

627
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,533
So you were wrong.

628
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:09,745
-You would just love that, wouldn't you?
-No, I'm just stating a fact.

629
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:12,040
No, you're gloating.
Despite the fact that if I am wrong,

630
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,959
we don't reach past the wall,
and don't find Holly and the other kids.

631
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,753
Do you understand
how selfish you're being?

632
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:19,380
Me? Selfish? You wanna talk about selfish?

633
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,341
How about
when we finally reach Hop and El,

634
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:24,510
we promptly ditch them
to pursue this bullshit theory of yours?

635
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:27,597
Not to mention, you're the reason
that we lost contact with them

636
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,015
because of your no-show at the crawl.

637
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:32,936
So this whole mess is actually your fault.
And I haven't heard so much as a sorry.

638
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:35,813
Shit. Again, it's not like
I just didn't show up. I was attacked.

639
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:38,066
No, you wanted a fight,
and that's what you got.

640
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,775
Just look at your face.

641
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:43,654
You've done some stupid shit in the past,
but this? Man, this takes the cake.

642
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:44,989
You wanna talk about dumb shit?

643
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,741
How about chasing
somebody else's girlfriend

644
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:47,825
while the world is ending?

645
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:52,330
Nancy is a friend. She's a friend, okay?

646
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:54,874
You remember what that's like?
Having friends?

647
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:58,461
Yeah, I do. I remember
what it was like to have a good friend,

648
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:02,298
a real friend who actually believed in me,
and who was actually kind to me.

649
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:04,050
-Aha! Aha!
-What? What?

650
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:06,844
There we go. What this has all been about,
really, is Eddie.

651
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:09,013
All your bullshit, pushing everyone away,

652
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:11,432
it's because no one could ever be
as perfect as he was.

653
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:14,102
He wasn't perfect,
but at least he knew that, unlike you.

654
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:17,438
He was never fake. He didn't care
what other people thought about him.

655
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:19,357
He was just himself.

656
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,694
And you know what? He was the smartest,
kindest person I've ever met.

657
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:25,237
And he would've solved this
in 30 seconds flat.

658
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:28,687
If I'm such a goddamn idiot,
how come I'm the one still standing here?

659
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,327
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

660
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,703
That night,

661
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:36,540
I told you not to be heroes.
I told both of you.

662
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:38,501
What did Eddie do?

663
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,754
-He charged into a swarm of killer bats.
-To save my life.

664
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:42,880
He saved no one.

665
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:45,300
-He saved everyone!
-You can keep telling yourself that.

666
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,593
But deep down,
the reason you're so goddamn pissed

667
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:49,387
is because you know the truth.

668
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,014
Eddie wanted to play hero,

669
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:56,060
and he made a dumb call,
and he got himself killed.

670
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:57,436
Shut up!

671
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:02,191
[Steve] No! What the hell, man?

672
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:04,610
What are you doing, man? Stop it.

673
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:07,029
Hey! Stop!

674
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:09,156
Stop it, man! Henderson!

675
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,451
Hey! Hey! Henderson!
Hey, what are you doing?

676
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:14,954
Calm down! Calm... Henderson, Henderson!

677
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:18,374
Jesus! You're gonna hurt yourself, man!

678
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:21,210
[both grunting in pain]

679
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,880
All right, Dustin.

680
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,299
[Dustin screaming]

681
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:32,596
Enough, man! Enough! Enough! Stop!

682
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:36,725
[both groaning in pain]

683
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,686
You know what, man?

684
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,231
I'm done.

685
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:48,904
I'm done.

686
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:52,852
[crying] All right, yeah, just go
and crawl back to Nance!

687
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:54,660
You dumb,

688
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,204
fake asshole!

689
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,292
[door creaks open]

690
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:48,422
What the hell?

691
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,052
[Jonathan] What do you think?

692
00:41:57,097 --> 00:42:01,477
Maybe some kind of nuclear explosion,
like Chernobyl?

693
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,020
Yeah.

694
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:07,650
That's what I was thinking,
but in a nuclear explosion,

695
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:11,737
everything would burn.
It wouldn't just melt like this.

696
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:15,115
Do you notice the air?

697
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:18,702
-The air?
-Yeah.

698
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:20,746
Look, it's clean.

699
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:22,456
There's no spores.

700
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:28,963
Whatever happened here,

701
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:31,048
Vecna's behind it.

702
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:32,967
Had to be.

703
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,301
Dark magic.

704
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:39,056
Whoa! Shit!

705
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:45,187
-Okay. All right, okay.
-Yeah.

706
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:47,940
-[Jonathan] You all right?
-I'm fine.

707
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:49,024
Okay.

708
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:51,777
-Oh, Jesus.
-Oh.

709
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:54,613
[Jonathan] Christ.

710
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,658
[Nancy] What the hell happened here?

711
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:01,453
[both breathing uneasily]

712
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:09,128
You just had to pick up, didn't you?

713
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:20,347
[alarm blaring]

714
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,519
[both grunting]

715
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:28,355
-[gunshot echoes]
-[thunder crashes]

716
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:33,319
I never knew
how close I was to making it out.

717
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:35,904
Now, thanks to you
and your policeman, I do.

718
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:39,742
Ten yards.

719
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:42,703
Ten yards.

720
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:47,207
One more corner,
and my life would have been...

721
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,335
different.

722
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:53,047
[guard] Gun!

723
00:43:58,135 --> 00:43:59,345
[guard grunting]

724
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:04,850
[guard grunting] Open the goddamn door!

725
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:06,727
Open up!

726
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:11,190
In my search for a way out,
I found something else.

727
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,568
I found the answer

728
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:18,614
<i>to why I was there.</i>

729
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,086
<i>They were infusing her</i>

730
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:35,798
<i>and her unborn child</i>

731
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:39,009
<i>with my blood.</i>

732
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:47,059
<i>And it was killing her,
along with her unborn child.</i>

733
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:48,352
[wheezing]

734
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:50,396
Help.

735
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,357
-[pounding on door]
-[guard grunting]

736
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:03,325
[pounding on door continues]

737
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:10,666
I don't know how many there were,
but they were all sick.

738
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:12,543
Dying.

739
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:23,595
-[tasers crackling]
-[Kali groaning]

740
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:25,681
[Kali screaming]

741
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:29,393
I... I... I don't understand.

742
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:32,688
Pregnant women.

743
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:36,066
A secret government program.

744
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:40,362
Does that not remind you of anything?

745
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:43,407
Mama.

746
00:45:58,297 --> 00:46:01,258
It was not drugs
that gave us our powers, Jane.

747
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,260
It was Henry.

748
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:12,352
Now, Dr. Kay is trying
to restart Papa's program,

749
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:15,564
but my blood is not working.

750
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:17,483
<i>Not as Henry's did.</i>

751
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:24,656
<i>The truth is, Papa's children
were always just pale imitations of Henry.</i>

752
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:26,825
Only one of us...

753
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:29,578
was truly like him.

754
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:34,541
This is just an illusion.
This isn't real. None of this is real.

755
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:37,419
Why do you think
Kay is so desperate to find you?

756
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:41,590
They will find you,
and they will create more! More like you!

757
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:43,926
Like Henry.

758
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:55,521
There are no happy endings, Jane.

759
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:57,397
Not for us.

760
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:03,278
Hey, it's okay. It's just me.

761
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:05,447
It's just me.

762
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:32,975
[whispering] Northwest. Northwest.

763
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:35,302
-[dark music playing]
-A little lost, are we?

764
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:51,159
Who gave you this map?

765
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:52,744
Your mom!

766
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:53,996
Look at me!

767
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:56,790
You lie to me again,

768
00:47:57,624 --> 00:48:02,379
and I will kill your fool of a father...

769
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:07,384
your snake of a mother...

770
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:14,141
and that bitch of a sister too.

771
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:18,186
[bell ringing]

772
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,660
-All right, my dears. Playtime's over.
-Come on.

773
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:22,721
[Miss Harris] Come on.

774
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:25,319
What is with that grumpy face?

775
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:28,822
Come on. We have books to read,
art to create,

776
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:31,617
wisdom to unlock.

777
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:36,247
Are you positive nothing else happened

778
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:37,957
-before the Demo showed up?
-Yes.

779
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,750
Walk me through everything again
from the beginning.

780
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:41,784
-I've told you already.
-Tell me again.

781
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:46,548
Mary and I were at the merry-go-round.

782
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:49,509
-Stop, Derek! Get off! Stop!
-Hold on tight!

783
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:54,181
Derek was a dipshit to us, like usual,
and then Henry called me over there.

784
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:56,392
He told me he'd protect me
from the monsters,

785
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:59,186
and I didn't see him again
until the field.

786
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:01,772
I just got in trouble
for having an imaginary friend,

787
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:05,817
and Mom got all weird,
and she got into a big fight with Dad.

788
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:18,080
[Max] What is it?

789
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:20,666
That's wrong. It should be yellow.

790
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:21,750
[Mary] Stop!

791
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:39,101
[distant screaming]

792
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:41,687
[Holly] <i>Mom! Mom!</i>

793
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,188
<i>Mom! Dad!</i>

794
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:46,233
<i>Please, please let me go! Let me go!</i>

795
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:50,445
Mom! Mom! Mom!

796
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:55,200
-Help! Help, Mom! Mom! Dad!
-[roaring]

797
00:49:57,786 --> 00:49:59,298
-Get back!
-[glass shattering]

798
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:00,956
[Max] Holly. Holly.

799
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,000
You all right?

800
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:06,503
I don't know.

801
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:08,339
I don't know. I feel...

802
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:09,756
Scared?

803
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,633
We're close to the final memory.

804
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:16,346
You might start to... feel things,

805
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:18,348
some things that you felt that night.

806
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:20,767
I know I did.

807
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:25,147
But it's just like an echo.

808
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:26,982
It's a good sign.

809
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:29,818
It means you're almost home.

810
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:36,658
Come on. Follow me.

811
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:47,711
You said <i>I'm</i> almost home.

812
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:51,298
But you're coming too, right?

813
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:53,800
Mmm. No.
I'm gonna stick around here, actually.

814
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:57,179
Of course. Are you kidding?

815
00:50:57,262 --> 00:50:58,138
Come on.

816
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:04,687
-[Robin] Hey!
-[Mike] What are you doing?

817
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:05,938
Cables won't reach the ground.

818
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:08,948
We're gonna have to do
our little science experiment up here.

819
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:17,908
Okay. Take it really slow.

820
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:21,203
Okay.

821
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:25,332
-Ready? Ready?
-Yeah.

822
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:26,708
Ready!

823
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:49,898
[Robin] Okay, we're all set.

824
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:58,115
If anything happens,
you just get out of there.

825
00:51:58,198 --> 00:51:59,783
I will. I promise.

826
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:02,953
And if shit really hits the fan,
we just crank up the voltage,

827
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:06,039
burn out the particles,
unplug him from the hive.

828
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,293
-Mom?
-Yeah?

829
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:12,671
Thank you for trusting me.

830
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:16,508
Kill the bastard.

831
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:19,594
[Lucas] All right. You got this.

832
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:24,808
Light her up, Frankenstein.

833
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:26,685

00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:10,145
It's working. It's working!

836
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:11,730
We're at 50%!

837
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:17,027
Come on. Come on.

[Demogorgon shrieking]

Dipshit!

840
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:46,765
Where is he? Where's Mr. Whatsit?

841
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:48,266
I think I'm Derek.

842
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:51,561
-Derek?
-He's with the others.

843
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:55,099
-The other lost children.
-[Mike] What about Holly?

844
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:57,442
-Do you see Holly?
-No.

845
00:53:57,525 --> 00:54:01,655
Spit it out, dipshit!
Mr. Whatsit, where is he?

846
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:03,323
[Derek] Searching for Holly.

847
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:06,952
Henry is searching for her.

848
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:10,038
Holly would never run away.
She isn't like that. You're lying.

849
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:13,124
[Derek] I'm not lying.
A monster tricked her.

850
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:16,294
It's disguised as a girl
with weird clothes and red hair.

851
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:17,379
She calls herself...

852
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:18,296
Max.

853
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,090
Wait. What about Max?

854
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:21,216
She's with Holly.

855
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,594
But Vecna... Vecna's hunting them.

856
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:37,274
I just stood there.

Why didn't I fight? Why didn't I help her?

858
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:41,987
That was old Holly.

859
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:43,738
You would now.

What is that?

865
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:17,188
Our exit.

866
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:19,774
It doesn't look like an exit.

[thunder rumbling]

00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:27,073
You sure you're not a monster?

Pretty sure.

Oh, God.

928
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:54,442
[Jonathan] <i>Dustin, Steve, you guys copy?</i>

929
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:56,611
We found the shield generator.
Do you copy?

01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:00,782
Jonathan, it's Dustin. Do you copy?

931
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:04,994
I can't hear you. Can you hear me?
We have found the shield generator.

Just listen to me, okay?
Don't do anything.

If you can hear me, I was wrong!

940
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:44,784
The shield generator,
it's not a shield generator!

941
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:48,121
It's not dark magic! It's something else!
