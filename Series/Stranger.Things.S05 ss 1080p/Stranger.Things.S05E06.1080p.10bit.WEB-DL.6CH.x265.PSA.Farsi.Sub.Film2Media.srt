1
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,888
<i>Jonathan! Nancy! Jonathan!</i>

2
00:00:14,764 --> 00:00:16,349
Jonathan! Nancy!

3
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,436
What the hell are you doing?

4
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,689
Listen to me! Don't touch anything!

5
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:37,787
Maybe you missed?

6
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:56,723
-Maybe we should, uh...
-Yeah.

7
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:43,353
Before you say anything,
I know it's 5:00 in the morning,

8
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,397
but I need you
to build me a telemetry tracker.

9
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,273
What? Erica, it is...

10
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,359
Five in the morning.
She led with that, buddy.

11
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,611
I'm sorry. Who are you?

12
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,738
-My uncle.
-Babysitter. Babysitter.

13
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,115
Who is it, snookums?

14
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:59,035
It's okay, sugar lump. Go back to bed.
I'll just be one second.

15
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,328
Okay.

16
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:01,663
The librarian?

17
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,832
You get too loud in the sack,
she shush you?

18
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:10,171
Okay, listen. You and whoever you are,
this is highly inappropriate.

19
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,340
I will see you in class, Erica.

20
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,343
Dustin is in danger.

21
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,138
Danger? What kind of danger?

22
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:19,848
Like the life or death kind.

23
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:23,018
What do you say, snookums?
You gonna keep playing with your bookworm,

24
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:26,062
or you gonna build us our tracker
and save your star student?

25
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,233
Henderson!

26
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,277
Dustin!

27
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,737
Dustin. Hey. What the hell was that?

28
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,990
Was that the shield generator?
Did they find it?

29
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,324
I was wrong.

30
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,285
I was terribly,

31
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,037
catastrophically wrong.

32
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,205
What?

33
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,332
After you left, I found a journal.

34
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,626
<i>Brenner's journal.</i>

35
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,381
<i>The key to destroying that wall
is in this lab,</i>

36
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:56,050
<i>but it is not a shield generator.</i>

37
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,636
It isn't dark magic. Vecna didn't make it.

38
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:03,391
Science did.

39
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:07,979
<i>Theoretical physicists call it
exotic matter.</i>

40
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,066
A single source of energy
that is holding that giant wall together,

41
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,569
and I think Nancy just shot it.

42
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:28,542
<i>How is that bad? That's why
we're here, to get through this wall.</i>

43
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,627
-You are not listening!
-I am listening.

44
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,255
Vecna didn't make the wall.
So he isn't on the other side,

45
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:36,411
which means Holly and the missing kids
aren't either. Nobody is.

46
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:40,129
Then what the hell is
on the other side of that wall?

47
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,105
Why'd it stop?

48
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,031
Dustin, what's on the other side
of the wall?

49
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:01,658
Death.

50
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,120
Whoa.

51
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:14,614
Come on! Come on, let's go!

52
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,798
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

53
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,633
Let's go! Let's go!

54
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,468
Get down! Get down!

55
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,397
This whole time,

56
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,650
<i>everything we have ever assumed
about the Upside Down has been</i>

57
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:37,944
dead wrong.

58
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,534
The gate!

59
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,743
The gate!

60
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:48,663
I can clear a path!

61
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:52,834
No, no, no!
You stay behind... stay behind me!

62
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,919
No! Goddamnit!

63
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:05,346
No!

64
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,056
No! No!

65
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:22,405
This place, the Upside Down,

66
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:25,992
<i>it isn't another dimension.
It's not another world.</i>

67
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,702
<i>It's a wormhole.</i>

68
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:28,786
A bridge

69
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:33,791
between two points in time and space,
between our world and another.

70
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,460
And if the bridge collapses?

71
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,378
It will take us with it.

72
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:41,049
All of us.

73
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,503
Go, go, go, go!

74
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,386
Are you okay? Are you okay? It's okay.

75
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,306
We're safe here.
He can't get us here, okay?

76
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:54,390
Max...

77
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,109
Holly!

78
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,861
Come on.

79
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:14,076
Holly, sweetheart.
Stop, or I'll hurt her.

80
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:20,416
I know you believe Max is your friend.

81
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:25,254
But she has tricked you, Holly.
She has corrupted your mind.

82
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,215
She is a liar.

83
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,634
No! No, you're the liar!

84
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:32,011
I saw you! I saw what you really are!

85
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:35,306
You're a monster! A disgusting monster!

86
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:36,849
Holly!

87
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:40,520
If you don't come back with me right now
and rejoin the other children,

88
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,272
I will have no choice but to hurt Max.

89
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,153
I may even have to kill her.

90
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,405
Then why don't you? Huh?

91
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,074
I'm right here.

92
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:54,909
Oh, that's right.

93
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:59,288
You're too scared of a stupid cave,
you goddamn coward!

94
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,792
Things have changed, Max.

95
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:07,255
There are now other ways to get to you.

96
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:08,923
And Holly?

97
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:13,177
When your new friend begins to suffer,

98
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,180
and she will suffer,

99
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:20,184
you can either return to me
and end her suffering,

100
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:23,396
or you can watch your new friend die.

101
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,982
Her life is in your hands.

102
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:14,947
<i>Can someone please explain to me
what the hell happened out there?</i>

103
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:18,743
We burnt out the particles.
I watched them fly up the tower.

104
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:21,246
-I mean, you guys saw that, right?
-Hard to miss.

105
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,623
So Will should be unplugged
from the hive mind.

106
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,792
-Theoretically.
-But why didn't he wake up?

107
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,752
How did he see Max if she's with Holly?

108
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:30,630
Is this real?
Is Vecna messing with us again?

109
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,506
This makes no goddamn sense!

110
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:37,094
The doctors, they never understood
why Max was in the coma, right?

111
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,721
What? No. Why?

112
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:43,934
Okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay.

113
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:47,730
So let's just assume for a second
that everything that Will saw was real.

114
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,066
-He saw Max. He saw Holly.
-Yeah, but how?

115
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:53,194
I'm getting to that. Let's say that, uh...

116
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,321
this is Will,

117
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:58,824
and this is Holly.

118
00:10:58,908 --> 00:10:59,784
And...

119
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:03,621
uh, this, of course, is Max.

120
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,417
They're in three disparate locations,
the Squawk, the hospital,

121
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,752
and some presently unknown place
in the Upside Down. Right?

122
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,045
-Right.
-Yeah.

123
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:14,799
But they share one very essential thing
in common.

124
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,217
They're all unconscious.

125
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,524
What happens when Vecna captures you?

126
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,056
You go into a trance.

127
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,225
Which would look
a heck of a lot like a coma.

128
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:27,478
No wonder the doctors are so clueless.
Max was never in a coma.

129
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,188
She was in a trance.

130
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,692
Just like Will. Just like Holly.

131
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:36,487
It is hitting me
like a Whitney Houston high note.

132
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,155
What if their minds...

133
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,700
are all in the same place?

134
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,077
In Vecna's mind.

135
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:45,538
Imprisoned.

136
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,290
At least, they were.

137
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,583
If Will's right,

138
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:53,754
then Max and Holly
are now making a prison break.

139
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,297
And if they succeed,

140
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:58,759
they will return to their physical bodies,

141
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,388
and Max will come back to life.

142
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:05,266
And they'll have been
in Vecna's mind, literally.

143
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,310
They'll know everything.
They'll know where Will is.

144
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,604
-Where the kids are.
-They might even know what he's planning.

145
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,732
-That's endgame.
-The fate of the planet may very well rest

146
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:16,402
in the hands of your comatose girlfriend
and your baby sister.

147
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:18,320
It's worth one more shot, right?

148
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,947
-Can you drive?
-Not legally.

149
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,116
Good enough.
Take Joyce's car. Do not get pulled over.

150
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,701
Get to Max. I'll stay with Will.

151
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:24,785
Okay.

152
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,160
Do you remember this place...

153
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:08,662
William?

154
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,125
No, no, no...

155
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:16,837
-Does it... bring back...
-No.

156
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:22,593
Memories?

157
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,638
Max, Holly...

158
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,808
They got away, didn't they?

159
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,228
Did the leg slow you down?

160
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,397
You think you are clever, don't you?

161
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:41,320
But remember, I am the one.

162
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,365
The one who invited you in.

163
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,285
You were my vessel.

164
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,746
My spy.

165
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,083
My builder.

166
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,377
Builder?

167
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:03,217
How do you think the tunnels came to be,
William?

168
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:08,889
You built them

169
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:13,561
<i>each and every night you slept.</i>

170
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,820
There is much power within you.

171
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:26,365
But make no mistake, boy.

172
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:30,327
They are my powers,

173
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:34,623
and they are stronger than ever before.

174
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,547
Much stronger.

175
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,268
Now, at last, it is time.

176
00:14:55,394 --> 00:15:01,066
Time for my vessels
to lead us to a new world.

177
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,403
A better world.

178
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:09,992
Too bad your world will never exist,

179
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:13,078
now that Max has one of your vessels.

180
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:17,791
There are ways
to smoke a fox from its den, William.

181
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,294
And you are going to help me.

182
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:25,049
You are going to be my spy

183
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:29,094
one last time.

184
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,095
No.

185
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,555
Never.

186
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,777
The more you resist...

187
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,739
the more this will hurt.

188
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:16,767
Stupid.

189
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,107
-Hey!
-What are you doing?

190
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,567
Seeing if he's still out there.

191
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,860
-He's not.
-How do you know?

192
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,696
Because he knows he can't get us in here.
Let's go.

193
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:32,032
He said that things had changed,
that there were other ways.

194
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:35,161
Yeah, and he's totally full of shit.
You should know this by now.

195
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:39,915
So we're supposed to what?
Just do nothing? Accept our fate?

196
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,375
No, we're not accepting shit.

197
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,711
We're just staying alive
until we're rescued.

198
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,796
-Rescued by Eleven?
-Mm-hmm.

199
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,256
How do you know that was even her?

200
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,634
Unless you know somebody else
with psychic powers

201
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,177
who's able
to remotely infiltrate Vecna's mind,

202
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:56,306
fight him off, communicate through him
to tell us to run, then it had to be El.

203
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,477
Which means she knows we're here,
and she'll come and she'll save us.

204
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,645
Now, can you please stop pacing?

205
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,273
Seriously, you're starting
to remind me of your brother.

206
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:09,278
Thank you.

207
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:17,953
Why can't Henry
come in here anyway?

208
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,246
I don't know.

209
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,750
You've had two years with nothing to do.

210
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,461
You must have a theory.

211
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:31,967
If we're just waiting,
we might as well talk.

212
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,142
-This prison...
-Camazotz.

213
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,269
Camazotz. Sure.

214
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:47,232
It's made up of Henry's memories, right?

215
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:50,444
Including this cave.

216
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:54,198
So I figure it's like,

217
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:56,909
I don't know,
a memory that, for whatever reason,

218
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:59,328
Henry doesn't want to face.

219
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,747
Something traumatic.

220
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:07,711
Except there's nothing in here
that is even remotely scary, so...

221
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,630
maybe not.

222
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,509
Anyway, that's my theory.

223
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,011
I like it.

224
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:19,389
Thanks.

225
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,851
And if you're right,

226
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:27,439
maybe we can escape through this memory.

227
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,358
-What?
-Okay, so...

228
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:33,487
My house, your attic,
those were traumatic memories too,

229
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,447
and they led us out of Camazotz.

230
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:38,075
So maybe Henry's memory can too.

231
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:41,036
First of all, there's nothing in here,
as I said.

232
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,956
Secondly, our memories
weren't simply traumatic.

233
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:47,543
They were memories of the precise moment
that Henry stole our minds.

234
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,711
And he can't steal his own mind, can he?

235
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:53,215
-How do you know?
-Because that makes no sense.

236
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,551
And everything in this place makes sense?

237
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:58,720
I mean,

238
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,348
maybe there's like a...

239
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:04,977
a secret passageway or something.

240
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:08,355
Right, yes, I totally forgot
about the secret passage.

241
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,235
What about out there?

242
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,612
Sand. Lots of sand.

243
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,490
-You've searched it?
-Yes.

244
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,366
-All of it?
-It goes on for miles.

245
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:20,951
So, no.

246
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,455
You are not going out there.

247
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:29,334
Holly, we're staying here,
and we wait for Eleven, end of story.

248
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,753
I don't think Henry was bluffing

249
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,922
when he said
there's another way to get to you.

250
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:36,133
We have to find a way out of here
before that happens.

251
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:37,843
You coming?

252
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:41,451
Or are you gonna let
a child head into the desert unsupervised?

253
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:43,765
I take it back.

254
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:47,311
You don't remind me of your brother.
You <i>are</i> your brother!

255
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:02,242
Joyce?

256
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,319
Did someone call the funeral home?

257
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,716
Mike.

258
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,262
El!

259
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,555
Oh, Mike...

260
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:32,064
I'm here now.

261
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,316
You're okay.

262
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:35,567
I'm okay.

263
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,070
This is Kali,

264
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:39,863
my sister.

265
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,615
And this must be the famous Mike.

266
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,660
I don't... I don't understand.

267
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:48,163
It's a long story.
Probably best just to tell it once.

268
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:51,124
Where's the rest of our greeting party?

269
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,089
He's just in here.

270
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:05,806
Oh, Jesus.

271
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,100
How long has he been like this?

272
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,268
A few hours.

273
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,021
Do you think you can find him?

274
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:21,614
Any clue in there about how long
it takes a wormhole to collapse?

275
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:22,698
Ten minutes, maybe 20?

276
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,867
I thought it'd be instantaneous.
Clearly not.

277
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,077
-Why do you sound disappointed?
-I'm not disappointed.

278
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,913
-You sound disappointed.
-I'm confused.

279
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,290
As far as I see it,
there are two possibilities.

280
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:34,001
Either this is the afterlife,
and you and I are spirits.

281
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,127
-Which seems unlikely.
-Ooh.

282
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:39,423
Or Nancy didn't completely destroy
the exotic matter.

283
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:42,801
Because if she did, the walls
of the wormhole would have collapsed.

284
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:44,929
And we would have been sucked
into oblivion.

285
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,056
Okay, so what
are we waiting around here for?

286
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,181
Where are you going?

287
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,934
To see if I can get a damn signal
to find Nancy.

288
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,770
-Steve, wait.
-Let's go, Henderson.

289
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,146
-Wait!
-Let's go.

290
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,482
Steve, we don't know if it's safe up here.

291
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,360
You said
the exotic matter wasn't destroyed.

292
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,403
No, I said
it was not completely destroyed.

293
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,655
But it was very clearly disturbed.

294
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:07,909
We have no idea what effect this will have
on matter, space-time, gravity.

295
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,745
This whole building could very well be

296
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:12,456
a highly unstable,
physics-defying death trap.

297
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,166
It seems pretty stable to me.

298
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,960
Nancy, you copy? Jonathan, are you there?

299
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:18,837
Hello?

300
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:24,426
Mother of God.

301
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,770
Please tell me they're not up there.

302
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,880
No, no, no, no. No! Nancy!

303
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:07,594
Nancy! No, no, no.

304
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:08,637
Nancy!

305
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,806
Come on. Nancy.

306
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,808
Come on. Come on.

307
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:15,602
-Are you okay? Are you okay? Okay.
-Yeah. I think so.

308
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:17,479
What happened?

309
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:19,898
I don't know. I don't know.

310
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:23,068
I guess we fell.

311
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:25,195
And also clearly didn't destroy it.

312
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:26,780
Just pissed it off.

313
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:30,450
Come on. Let's go.

314
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,871
Let's get the hell out of here.

315
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,584
-Where's the door?
-Shit, shit.

316
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,337
It's there. Come on.

317
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:47,300
Shit!

318
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:53,723
No, no, no! Shit! Shit! No, no, no, no!

319
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:58,145
Goddamnit.

320
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:00,856
Come on!

321
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:25,505
Nancy, she didn't leave
a note or anything at the church?

322
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:28,175
No. No, nothing.

323
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:31,636
Which means they're either
a bunch of inconsiderate pricks,

324
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,097
or they got captured by the military.

325
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:37,810
To put your mind at ease, I am heavily
leaning on the inconsiderate prick theory.

326
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:41,480
Wait, and that flesh wall you found,
you don't think...

327
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:44,392
They got sucked into
the giant vacuum cleaner? No, I don't.

328
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:48,528
But I don't really know, Mike.
I'm as confused as you.

329
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:54,451
This whole thing, Max, Holly, this wall,
it's all gotta connect somehow,

330
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:55,577
but I can't figure out how.

331
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,788
It's like
there's a missing piece of the puzzle.

332
00:24:58,872 --> 00:24:59,748
A big piece.

333
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:03,460
The pieces are in Vecna's mind,
and now we finally have a way to get in.

334
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,629
Except Jane hasn't found anything.

335
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:09,508
Oh, boy! Here comes Pollyanna
to brighten everybody's day.

336
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,092
She's struggling up there.

337
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,303
Oh, yeah?
Maybe you should give her some time.

338
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:15,472
She's getting weaker, not stronger.

339
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:19,017
So you are the expert on El, huh?

340
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,978
You've known her for what,
a day and a half?

341
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,188
Longer than you, actually.

342
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:26,983
We were raised together,
and her name is Jane.

343
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,027
-Jane Hopper.
-I'm just here to help.

344
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:32,322
You're just here to help.
Well, I'm sorry I'm all out of gratitude.

345
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:34,116
I thought you said
this fight was pointless.

346
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,951
You said this whole thing was pointless?

347
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,327
I never said that.

348
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:40,372
Really? It sure as shit sounded to me
like you did.

349
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:43,250
I leave you alone for two seconds with El,
and you worm your way into her head.

350
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:46,503
She's probably having trouble finding Will
because you've thrown her off track.

351
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:49,464
She was off track when I met her
because of you.

352
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:50,882
Because of your lies.

353
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,384
Everything I have done...

354
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:55,512
...is to protect her.
Keep telling yourself that,

355
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:58,807
but if you really want to protect her,
she needs to know the truth,

356
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,851
and she needs to be ready
to deal with what's waiting for her

357
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:03,645
on the other side of this.

358
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:07,357
Killing Henry won't end this.

359
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,400
What does that mean?

360
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:13,238
It means nothing. She's a child.
She has no idea what she's talking about.

361
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:15,115
She's talking a bunch of nonsense.

362
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:17,158
I think you know I'm not.

363
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:22,706
But just as you lie to Jane,
you also lie to yourself.

364
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:27,752
You ask why I'm still here?

365
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:34,467
I'm here to make sure
that this never happens again.

366
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:41,891
El.

367
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:47,314
El!

368
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,691
Hey, is everything okay?

369
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:53,695
I can't reach him. He keeps slipping away.

370
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,780
Well, we have plenty of food in there,

371
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:58,950
so eat, rest, and recharge your battery,
and we'll try it again.

372
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,035
Or...

373
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,412
we improve your signal.

374
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,790
-The tank.
-Yeah. It'll take a while to set up.

375
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,750
But you've gotta
recharge your battery anyway.

376
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:10,545
Plus, that thing was a pain to build,
so I'd like to get some use out of it.

377
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:21,181
-Doris, I'm gonna sign in later.
-I'm here for emotional support.

378
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:23,266
Miss Buckley! Miss Buckley!

379
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,560
Oh! You know what?

380
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:29,230
Hey.

381
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,940
-We need to talk.
-Yeah.

382
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:33,068
-Wait, Robin!
-I've gotta deal with this. Just go!

383
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,152
What about the plan?

384
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:35,403
Vickie.

385
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,783
Listen, I know you're pissed,
and you have every right to be.

386
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:41,660
-They're looking for you.
-Who is looking for me?

387
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,662
-Security. MPs.
-Why?

388
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:46,123
-You wanna play dumb?
-I have no idea what you're talking about.

389
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,833
Okay, all right, let me give you a hint.

390
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,377
You, Mr. Bailey's room, benzos.

391
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,504
Well, does it ring a bell yet?

392
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:57,467
Robin, you've gotta start telling me
what is going on with you right now.

393
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:05,975
Okay, Max, time to come home.

394
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:10,313
["Running up that Hill"

395
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:23,285
I think
we've been at this long enough.

396
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,412
We've searched
an inch of this place.

397
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,414
At last, you get my point.

398
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:30,542
I've spent I don't know how long
searching out here, but too long.

399
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:33,629
You're not gonna just suddenly find
something that I haven't, okay?

400
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:36,548
Did my brother ever tell you
about Uncle Eric?

401
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:37,799
Uncle Eric?

402
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:40,385
He's a metal detectorist.
Do you know what that is?

403
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:41,761
He searches for metal.

404
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,596
Yeah, with his metal detector.

405
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,267
Looking for super old treasures and stuff
that dead people have left in the ground.

406
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:50,479
Anyway, his favorite place to search is
Indiana Beach Amusement Park.

407
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,647
I mean, he searched there for years,

408
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,067
but all he ever found
was a bunch of cheap trinkets.

409
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:58,653
Then one day, he opens up the newspaper
and boom, front page,

410
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,864
some random tourist found a tin can

411
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:04,034
filled with gold and silver coins
worth like millions of dollars.

412
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:07,328
Right, so let me guess,
in this scenario, I'm Uncle Eric...

413
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,705
And I'm the tourist.

414
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,300
So stupid.

415
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:38,943
"M" marks the spot.

416
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:45,283
-Where are you going?
-I have an idea.

417
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:47,285
-What idea?
-I'll show you when we're closer.

418
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:49,871
-Holly!
-You said you wanted to go back.

419
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,581
Well, we're going back.

420
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,295
Guys, if you can hear us, we're coming.
I repeat, we're coming.

421
00:29:57,378 --> 00:30:00,298
Steve, slow down! The higher we go,
the more dangerous it gets.

422
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:02,050
All the more reason to speed up.

423
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,260
We're no use to them if we're dead. Steve!

424
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:14,729
As I was saying...

425
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,319
Come on!

426
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:22,862
Damn it!

427
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,663
What are you doing?

428
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:35,502
A few floors down, it looked like one
of those soldiers cut through that door.

429
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,258
Watch out.

430
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,222
Shit! Get back!

431
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:53,977
Shit! Shit!

432
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,228
Oh, God!

433
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:02,944
Holy shit!

434
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:08,074
The table! Get to the table!

435
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:19,544
Now what?

436
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:28,052
Help! Help!

437
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,430
-Help! Help!
-Steve!

438
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:33,641
-Help! Help!
-Hey! Help!

439
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,853
-Help! Help! Help!
-Help! Help! Help!

440
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,086
Almost ready out here.

441
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:18,478
El's gonna fix this.

442
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:20,813
She's gonna fix it.

443
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:27,236
It was my idea, Hop.

444
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:29,447
It was...

445
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:32,575
my idea for him to go in there.

446
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:35,620
I don't know. I just thought maybe,

447
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:40,124
after everything that happened,
after everything I saw him do, that...

448
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:43,252
I started thinking maybe all this time

449
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:46,673
that I've been trying so hard
to protect him,

450
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:49,258
I've really just been holding him back

451
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,720
by not listening to him,

452
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,181
not trusting him.

453
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:56,683
And so if I just...

454
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:01,437
I don't know.
If I just believed and let go,

455
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:04,899
that, I don't know,
somehow this could all work out. And...

456
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:11,364
It's like every choice
that I make is wrong.

457
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:12,490
I know.

458
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:18,162
I mean, you can push them into situations
they might not be ready for.

459
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,832
You can be like me,
and you can be overprotective,

460
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:23,251
and they just resent you for that.

461
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,837
Joyce, one of the
joys of being a parent...

462
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,842
is that you'll have a constant reminder
your whole life

463
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:32,719
that every choice you've made

464
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:34,971
has been wrong.

465
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,059
It's not on you, Joyce.

466
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,188
It's not on you.

467
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,212
That looks nice.
Murray find that for you?

468
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:03,875
Yeah.

469
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:07,462
Santa Claus has good taste.

470
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:14,385
Hey. Back at the Squawk,

471
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:17,597
Kali, she said something weird

472
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,850
about this not being over
even if we kill Henry.

473
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:22,738
Do you know what she's talking about?

474
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,146
It doesn't matter.

475
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,190
I should warm this up.

476
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:31,027
Okay, well, if it doesn't matter,
then why was Hop so angry at her?

477
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,404
It's nothing, Mike, really.

478
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,239
-Friends don't lie.
-I'm not lying.

479
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:37,658
You're avoiding. That's a cheat.
I just want to help.

480
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,203
You can't help. Not with this.

481
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:42,080
Let me be the judge of that.

482
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:45,416
El, come on.

483
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:52,924
There's a lab in the Upside Down.

484
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:55,551
They're restarting Papa's program.

485
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,262
Trying to make new numbers.

486
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:03,059
The military?

487
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:07,730
Okay.

488
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:11,943
So, after we kill Vecna,
we destroy this new lab.

489
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:13,736
End the program. Like a side quest.

490
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,239
Mike, no, you don't understand.

491
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:19,450
They don't need a lab to make new numbers.

492
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:20,827
Henry's blood.

493
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:23,704
It's in me.

494
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,498
I'm not a monster.

495
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:28,209
I know that now.

496
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,837
But with me, with my blood,

497
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:34,382
they can make more monsters.

498
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:37,718
They can make more Henrys.

499
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,263
The military will always be looking
for you.

500
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:43,391
We've always known that.
Which is why we aren't staying in Hawkins.

501
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:46,352
When this is all over, we're leaving.

502
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:49,313
Escaping to some far off land. Remember?

503
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,566
Somewhere where they can't find us.

504
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:55,444
Somewhere
where there's at least one waterfall.

505
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:57,446
Mike.

506
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,493
This isn't like one of your campaigns.

507
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:05,371
You don't get to write the ending.

508
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,331
Not this time.

509
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,334
Maybe I don't.

510
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:12,670
But <i>we</i> do.

511
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:16,215
You, me, Lucas, Will, and Dustin.

512
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:18,342
Because this is our story.

513
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:21,804
And it starts with getting Will back.

514
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:38,988
Max.

515
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:52,418
You realize you don't need
your spyglass anymore? That's my cave.

516
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:53,336
Yep.

517
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:54,962
Also, the cap is still on.

518
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,464
Yep.

519
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:58,382
Look.

520
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:00,801
Cap on.

521
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:08,059
Okay, it's very dark.

522
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:09,060
But not totally.

523
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:10,645
You see that cutout of light?

524
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,897
It's in the same shape
as the cave entrance.

525
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,525
What are the chances
it cracks in the same shape as the cave,

526
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,318
the cave we know Henry visited?

527
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:20,696
I think the cap is a map,
a map Henry made when he was young,

528
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,365
a map that'll lead us
to some kind of secret location.

529
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:26,285
We just have to get the shapes to line up.

530
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:30,039
And you think in this secret location,
we'll find what?

531
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:31,582
Henry's traumatic memory?

532
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:34,168
That. And a way out of Camazotz.

533
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:37,296
At least... that's my theory.

534
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,715
-I like it.
-Thanks.

535
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:42,009
There's one tiny hole
in your theory, though.

536
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,804
We're near the secret location,
and I've got eyes,

537
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:48,140
and I still see absolutely nothing
but more goddamn sand...

538
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:51,852
Hold on!

539
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:53,896
Hold on!

540
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:14,083
"M" marks the spot.

541
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:25,803
Vic, do you want
to maybe verbalize something?

542
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:28,890
It's just unclear what your face
is trying to communicate here.

543
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:32,935
I know that it's a lot to absorb,
especially all in one go.

544
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,479
Monsters and alternate dimensions,

545
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:39,150
and I realize that the drugging
of the Turnbows was a bit unethical...

546
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:44,113
-Okay, stop, Robin. Please, just stop.
-I tried to tell you like a million times.

547
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:47,992
No, you lied. And then you kept lying
over and over and over again.

548
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:50,370
-I knew something was wrong.
-I know! I'm sorry!

549
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:51,913
"Crazy day at work. Call you tomorrow."

550
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,040
"Sorry, there's another crisis
at the Squawk."

551
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:56,292
I mean, who works all night
at a radio station?

552
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:59,378
And who is stupid enough to believe that?

553
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:00,963
Apparently me, Vickie,

554
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,549
who's sitting at home,
waiting for the phone to ring

555
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:05,510
while you're off with your friends,
getting high.

556
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:06,719
Getting high?

557
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:10,348
Come on, Robin.
You are going through withdrawal.

558
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,267
You have the wrong idea.
I am not on drugs.

559
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,060
-Right, sorry.
-Just look at me!

560
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:17,730
You have been busy with your friends
hunting monsters!

561
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:20,191
God! All right,
maybe you even believe it yourself.

562
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:23,736
With the amount that you were clearly on,
if you just go cold turkey,

563
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:26,072
it can cause confusion,
paranoia, hallucinations...

564
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:28,991
These are not hallucinations!

565
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:30,785
Okay. So let's recap.

566
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:32,995
-There is a dark wizard...
-Uh-huh.

567
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,455
-...who is stealing children...
-Yep.

568
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,999
-...and putting them in a dream world.
-Right.

569
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:42,129
Vickie, the earth has split in four.

570
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,757
The military has taken over our town.

571
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,301
Is what I'm saying really so insane?

572
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:49,804
Batshit!

573
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,515
You wanna know
what my face is communicating right now?

574
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:54,100
-Yes.
-Anger.

575
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:59,355
But with a dash,
and it is a very, very reluctant dash,

576
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:00,314
of worry.

577
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,442
Because as furious
as I am with you right now,

578
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:06,779
you are not well, Robin,
and you need help.

579
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:08,739
You need serious help.

580
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,076
-I got a call about some drugs...
-Hang on.

581
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,202
Have you seen her?

582
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:14,287
Robin Buckley?

583
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:17,346
Yes, she's here. I just saw her go
into that room right there.

584
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,626
Vickie, I'm so sorry.

585
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:21,544
Don't.

586
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:23,129
-But I gotta go.
-Robin!

587
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:24,755
Hey!

588
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,133
Hey, I'm talking to you!

589
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,717
Buckley, stop!

590
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:34,265
Where do you think you're going?

591
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:39,019
Help!

592
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,938
-Help!
-Dustin!

593
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:42,690
-Help! Steve!
-Hey!

594
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:47,278
Oh, thank you.

595
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:53,826
Steve, what the hell are you doing?
That's never gonna work. Stop! Stop!

596
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:57,121
Steve, stop. I'm serious. It's not safe.

597
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:59,665
-You're gonna fall.
-It's unstable. I got it already, okay?

598
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:02,334
No, don't! Stop being an asshole!

599
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:04,128
I'm not. I'm trying to get to them!

600
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:07,173
You always try to get yourself killed,
and I can't let it happen again.

601
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:08,841
Stop being so selfish, please.

602
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:11,803
If you go on there, you're gonna die,
and I can't deal with it again.

603
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:14,221
You can't die
'cause I can't deal with it again.

604
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:18,267
Don't let it happen again.
Please. Please don't let it happen again.

605
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:20,394
Not you.

606
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,605
I'm sorry.

607
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,898
No, no, no.

608
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,369
-Help!
-Help!

609
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,997
-Come on! Help! Hey!
-Help!

610
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,041
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

611
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:43,626
Down. Get down. Get down.

612
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:47,963
-What are we doing?
-Sitting spreads our weight out.

613
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:49,924
Mr. Goldstein, physics.

614
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:52,343
We can buy ourselves some time.

615
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,471
They must have heard us by now.

616
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:57,098
Then why haven't they called back?

617
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,433
And even if they did,
what could they even do?

618
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,393
Something. Anything.

619
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:02,645
Yeah. Yeah.

620
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,025
They're not coming.

621
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:09,568
Don't say that.

622
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:11,111
You wanted honesty.

623
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:32,758
I hate The Clash.

624
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:35,928
What?

625
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,516
I hate The Clash.

626
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:44,311
Every time you put them on,
I just try to disassociate from reality.

627
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:47,439
Yep.

628
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:48,983
I hate reading your articles.

629
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,902
You don't actually wanna hear my thoughts.

630
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:52,570
You just want me
to tell you they're great.

631
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:54,029
Because they are.

632
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:55,155
Most of the time.

633
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,532
Most of the...

634
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:58,117
Wow. Okay.

635
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,662
I never read <i>Slaughterhouse-Five.</i>

636
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:04,290
I just read the Cliff notes
and pretended I liked it.

637
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:05,749
I never read <i>Anna Karenina.</i>

638
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:08,294
I just read the Cliff notes
and pretended I liked it.

639
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:10,879
You are always exactly six minutes late,

640
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:15,009
and I never say anything,
but really, I wanna punch a wall.

641
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:16,927
I took your pink sweater to Goodwill.

642
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,762
What? I was looking for that.

643
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:19,972
You know I hate pink.

644
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:22,475
But I felt guilty afterwards
if that makes you feel better.

645
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:26,145
I flushed the last bag of
Purple Palm Tree Delight down the toilet,

646
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:27,897
and I didn't feel guilty about it after.

647
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,149
-Come on.
-I hate it when you're high.

648
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:31,359
I hate it when you're drunk.

649
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:34,403
I hate it most of all
when you're high and I'm drunk.

650
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:35,738
Me too.

651
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:38,032
Why do we do that?

652
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,494
No idea.

653
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:52,963
I never applied to Emerson.

654
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,008
I know.

655
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,595
Why didn't you ever say anything?

656
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:02,264
Why didn't you?

657
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,144
I'm not sure.

658
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,693
I just felt like I was...

659
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:17,988
doing something wrong.

660
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:24,787
Like I was going against
the natural order of things.

661
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:27,665
You know, with...

662
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:31,585
with what we've been through, it just...

663
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,629
You mean our shared trauma?

664
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:36,382
Yeah.

665
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:42,429
How could anyone else possibly understand?

666
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:43,806
It's like this...

667
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:46,558
this thing that...

668
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:50,145
ties us together forever.

669
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:52,022
You know?

670
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:56,151
It made me feel safe.

671
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:58,487
But also...

672
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:01,782
I don't know.

673
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:04,159
It can be suffocating.

674
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:06,912
Yeah.

675
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:12,126
That spring break,

676
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:15,087
when you were in Lenora...

677
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:19,299
I didn't really have to stay behind
to work.

678
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:21,969
I could have had Fred cover for me.

679
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:26,682
But I think that's why I stayed.

680
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:29,893
That feeling that I just...

681
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:31,937
I needed space.

682
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,442
Space to be with someone else?

683
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,532
Steve's a good guy.

684
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:46,744
He makes me laugh.

685
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:52,458
And, he has better hair than you.
Like, way better.

686
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:54,376
But no.

687
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:59,173
No, it was never like that with him.

688
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,633
We're just different people.

689
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:05,429
You know what he told me?
He wants six kids.

690
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:06,638
Six kids?

691
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:08,891
Six little nuggets.

692
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,101
That's like a Happy Meal.

693
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:14,021
But my point is...

694
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:18,942
he knows what he wants, and that's great.

695
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,360
But I...

696
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:22,196
don't.

697
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:25,282
And...

698
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:28,911
I guess I was hoping
I'd have time to figure that out.

699
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:32,706
-But then...
-The world split in four.

700
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,124
And now...

701
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:37,961

879
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:26,737
Lucas.

880
01:04:33,452 --> 01:04:34,996
Holly. Wait.

881
01:04:37,331 --> 01:04:38,374
You can't come with me.

882
01:04:38,457 --> 01:04:41,252
What? What do you mean?

883
01:04:41,335 --> 01:04:42,712
This way leads to me,

884
01:04:43,588 --> 01:04:46,340
to my body, not yours.

885
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:48,050
You have to find your own way.

886
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:51,679
How? I don't have Kate Bush.
I don't even know who Kate Bush is.

887
01:04:51,762 --> 01:04:53,681
You don't need Kate Bush
to get out of here.

888
01:04:53,764 --> 01:04:55,766
Turns out, I don't either.

889
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:58,144
Music isn't the only way back.

890
01:04:58,686 --> 01:05:03,149
You just need something that connects you
to the real world, to home.

891
01:05:03,816 --> 01:05:05,651
Something powerful,

892
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:07,486
meaningful.

893
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:11,198
Lucas, when... when he took my hand
in the hospital,

894
01:05:12,158 --> 01:05:14,785
I could feel it. Right here.

895
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:18,581
But then I could also feel it in here.

896
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:20,875
But I don't have a boyfriend.

897
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:22,293
You don't need a boyfriend.

898
01:05:22,376 --> 01:05:24,420
You just need something
that's special to you,

899
01:05:24,503 --> 01:05:27,548
something that makes you feel safe,

900
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:31,677
something that brings you strength,
something that gives you hope.

901
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:33,471
Holly the Heroic.

902
01:05:33,554 --> 01:05:35,306
She's here with you now.

903
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:38,768
But she's also with you in the real world.

904
01:05:38,851 --> 01:05:42,772
Wherever you are,
all you have to do is follow her home.

905
01:05:42,855 --> 01:05:43,940
How?

906
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:49,612
Just... try and remember
what it is that she means to you.

907
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:52,865
She doesn't mean anything important.

908
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:56,369
She's just a toy.

909
01:05:57,453 --> 01:06:00,331
If she's just a toy,
why do you always carry her with you?

910
01:06:00,414 --> 01:06:01,874
Mike.

911
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:05,586
He said that she had divine powers
and that she never gets scared,

912
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:09,632
and so if I ever got scared,
I could just... become her.

913
01:06:09,715 --> 01:06:13,219
But I keep trying, and it never works.

914
01:06:15,346 --> 01:06:17,348
No matter what I do, I'm still me.

915
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:22,186
The girl who needs a stupid night-light.

916
01:06:22,269 --> 01:06:25,314
When my mom was attacked,
I couldn't save her.

917
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:26,691
I couldn't even save myself.

918
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:28,359
Holly, get back!

919
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:31,529
I just stood there.

920
01:06:31,612 --> 01:06:33,531
And then when Henry attacked you...

921
01:06:34,198 --> 01:06:35,825
Stop!

922
01:06:35,908 --> 01:06:40,746
I stood there again.
There's nothing heroic about that.

923
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:44,208
There was nothing that you could do
in those moments, Holly.

924
01:06:44,291 --> 01:06:47,378
I mean, you're a Wheeler. You're smart.

925
01:06:48,129 --> 01:06:51,885
You honestly think that you could've
stopped those monsters with a fire poker?

926
01:06:52,299 --> 01:06:55,094
And I think you're leaving
a few important things out.

927
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:57,888
The day that we met,
you went into the woods

928
01:06:57,972 --> 01:07:00,558
even though Henry told you
that dangerous monsters live there.

929
01:07:00,641 --> 01:07:03,019
And then you followed me into the cave

930
01:07:03,102 --> 01:07:05,688
even though you had no good reason
to trust me.

931
01:07:05,771 --> 01:07:08,941
And then when I told you
to go back to Henry,

932
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:10,484
to go back into danger,

933
01:07:10,568 --> 01:07:11,861
you didn't hesitate.

934
01:07:11,944 --> 01:07:15,823
And today, when I gave up, you didn't.

935
01:07:17,408 --> 01:07:19,535
I've been here for so long, Holly.

936
01:07:20,911 --> 01:07:21,996
So long.

937
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,875
And I could never make it out.

938
01:07:27,793 --> 01:07:29,253
But you?

939
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:32,381
You found a way through Camazotz.

940
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:33,716
Because of you...

941
01:07:35,092 --> 01:07:36,635
I get to see my friends.

942
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:39,221
I get to see Lucas.

943
01:07:41,182 --> 01:07:43,476
You saved me, Holly Wheeler.

944
01:07:44,977 --> 01:07:46,062
You saved me.

945
01:07:48,314 --> 01:07:52,610
So you see,
Holly the Heroic is not just a toy.

946
01:07:54,528 --> 01:07:56,030
She's you, Holly.

947
01:07:57,698 --> 01:07:58,699
She's you.

948
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:20,513
How did you know that would work?

949
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:23,724
I didn't.

950
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:30,523
You still have a long journey ahead.
I don't know where you're gonna wake up.

951
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:32,692
But I figure Vecna's holding you
in the Upside Down.

952
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:36,946
But remember, the Upside Down,
it's just like Hawkins.

953
01:08:37,029 --> 01:08:39,949
So find your way back to your house
and hide there.

954
01:08:40,032 --> 01:08:42,284
We will come and find you. Okay?

955
01:08:58,759 --> 01:09:00,271
I'll see you on the other side.

956
01:09:00,886 --> 01:09:02,012
On the other side.
