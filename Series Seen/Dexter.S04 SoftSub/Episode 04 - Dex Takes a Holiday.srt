1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,002
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:04,379
Dexter.

3
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:07,048
How's my favorite serial killer hunter?

4
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:10,301
The reason I'm in Miami
is because I'm convinced

5
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:13,137
that these bathtub murders
are connected

6
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:15,723
to a series of murders
all over the country.

7
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,809
It's always the same three kills with Trinity.

8
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:19,686
Young woman in a bathtub...

9
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:23,731
...followed by a mother
falling to her death.

10
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:27,527
You're next.

11
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,072
If this is the latest victim
of Lundy's Trinity Killer,

12
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:34,283
then he's a very different
monster than I am.

13
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,911
- Lundy has this theory...
- You don't work for Lundy.

14
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:40,123
You're welcome to pursue this, but between
the Vacation Murders and Lisa Bell,

15
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:41,582
I think you're gonna be very busy.

16
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:44,752
Yes, I did come to Miami
to follow a case,

17
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,255
but I have to admit I'm glad
the killer chose this city,

18
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:48,673
knowing I'd find you here.

19
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:52,844
Hey, good news! The Sandpiper Hotel
wants to book my band for a one-month gig.

20
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,095
Best of all, it means

21
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,264
- no more time away from you.
- Wow, that's great.

22
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,307
I'm not gonna tell you
who to date,

23
00:00:58,434 --> 00:01:02,478
but there's no such thing as "off the record"
with reporters, so watch the pillow talk.

24
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,522
Super Agent Lundy has a hunch

25
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:08,151
that the dead woman is connected
to this big serial killer case.

26
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:10,111
Lundy always gets his man.

27
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:12,572
Well, so do I.

28
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:16,701
Look, I was a little worried
that people will misinterpret.

29
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:20,538
Let them misinterpret.
I need this as much as you do.

30
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:24,876
The past few weeks, you have not been
the most present father and husband.

31
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:28,629
My dark passenger is like
a trapped coal miner,

32
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:30,798
always tapping,
always letting me know

33
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,760
it's still in there, still alive.

34
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,421
Everyone needs a vacation.

35
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:36,799
In my case, it's time off for bad behavior.

36
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:40,887
But I intend to make the most
of this family trip...

37
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:42,763
that they're taking without me.

38
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,307
- Shotgun!
- Shotgun!

39
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,142
- I called it first.
- I called it inside.

40
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:49,604
- It doesn't count if you call it inside.
- Does so! Mom! Dexter!

41
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,857
- How about you switch every hour?
- Want to trade places?

42
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:54,984
I stay home and...

43
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,446
you can stuff cousin Marlene into
some Spanx on her wedding day.

44
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:02,116
I wish I could, but things are pretty hectic
at the station.

45
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,201
You're not gonna work
the whole time, are you?

46
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:05,536
I'll try not to.

47
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:09,457
You can't let yourself get to that
boiling point again. It's not healthy.

48
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,043
And I'd rather not have to lie
to the neighbor again

49
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,879
if you decide to smash
any more security lights.

50
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:16,881
I hate that you saw me that way.

51
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:20,384
I'm your wife. I want to know
what's going on inside you.

52
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,511
I don't think you do.

53
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:25,973
Just recharge your batteries, all right?
Enjoy your freedom.

54
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,141
Go wild.

55
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,310
Right. Go wild.

56
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,103
Have fun.

57
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,607
- Say "Goodbye, Dexter."
- Goodbye, Dexter!

58
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:37,610
Goodbye, Dexter!
Bye-bye.

59
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,615
The kids left you a present
in the kitchen.

60
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,048
Just the thing to melt a father's heart.

61
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:03,636
Let the good times roll.

62
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:09,642
Whoops!

63
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:11,811
Three days.

64
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:15,523
72 precious hours
to recharge my batteries.

65
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:20,194
'Course Rita doesn't know I'll be recharging
with another woman.

66
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:23,823
Officer Zoey Kruger.

67
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:26,993
Pembroke Pines patrol.

68
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:29,996
Eight months ago,
Officer Kruger's husband and daughter

69
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:31,872
were killed during a home invasion.

70
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,333
Zoey was shot in the arm and foot.

71
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,254
She survived. Obviously.

72
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:42,466
But there was one person who thought
it was Zoey herself who killed her family.

73
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,680
The one person who always knows
the truth of a crime...

74
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,182
the blood guy.

75
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:54,020
Morgan. Good to see a friendly face.

76
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:55,604
Aren't many around here.

77
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:58,566
Nice to have an excuse to visit.

78
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,067
Even if I made it up.

79
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,778
With your caseload,
I can't believe you have time to write a paper

80
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,238
on feathering and blood swipes.

81
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,741
Well, I have a small window for...

82
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,284
a side project.

83
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,203
And I remembered at
the spatter conference last spring,

84
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,539
you mentioned something about
a questionable swipe

85
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:14,832
in a case you were working.

86
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:15,958
Who was it, Cooper?

87
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,753
Kruger, and, shhh, we don't talk about that.

88
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:30,681
Zoey's husband.
Shot in the stairway.

89
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:36,562
Her daughter in her bedroom.

90
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:43,235
Zoey said she was shot twice
wrestling the shooter's gun from him,

91
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,237
and turned it on him as he fled.

92
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,329
That blood swipe
belongs to Darius Rae,

93
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:57,374
a drug dealer Zoey roughed up
the day before her family was murdered.

94
00:06:57,501 --> 00:07:00,377
According to her, she winged him
in her front hallway.

95
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:03,172
The feathering is textbook.
Why'd you say it was questionable?

96
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:06,801
Because it's the only blood of Rae's
anywhere at the scene.

97
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,428
Interesting...

98
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,763
for my paper.

99
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,556
My theory?

100
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,476
Uh, forget it.
Doesn't matter.

101
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:18,104
You think she planted
the blood herself?

102
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:22,316
Maybe she even provoked
that confrontation with Darius Rae.

103
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,151
That's where she got his blood.

104
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:27,363
Also gives her the perfect narrative
for the crime.

105
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:29,573
Rae breaks in looking
for retribution,

106
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,201
cop's family becomes collateral damage.

107
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:34,578
Was Darius Rae ever arrested?

108
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:39,083
Darius Rae was gunned down in
a supposedly gang-related incident.

109
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:42,378
But that's another theory, another day.

110
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,630
I try not to think about it.

111
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,674
Because if I'm right,

112
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,843
there's a monster
walking around free.

113
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,970
With a badge and a gun.

114
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:56,767
Zoey said she aimed at Darius Rae
but only winged him.

115
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,314
But Zoey always hits her targets.

116
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,984
Just ask her husband and daughter.

117
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,987
I'm feeling recharged already.

118
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,033
Monsters come in all shapes and sizes.

119
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,370
Sometimes it's the very people
who are supposed to be protecting us:

120
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,831
a cop, a parent,

121
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,291
the spatter guy.

122
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,964
Oh, God. Close the door, will you?

123
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,175
Here's a bludgeoning from July.

124
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:32,386
The one we're looking for
will be five days after the suicide.

125
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,097
Right. Here's a middle-aged guy
from October.

126
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:38,893
- Sorry, I thought this was my lab.
- We're hiding from LaGuerta.

127
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:42,855
Quinn's reporter fuck-buddy has now
officially fucked all three of us.

128
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:48,402
"Catching the Vacation Murderer may not
be the department's top priority.

129
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,447
"Detectives spent last Thursday
indulging the pursuits of

130
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:56,118
"retired FBI manhunter, Frank Lundy."
It's a good picture.

131
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:59,747
I'm guessing that Lieutenant LaGuerta's
open-door policy with me...

132
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,123
is about to close.

133
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:04,043
We've got to narrow down
Trinity's next move.

134
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:07,671
Bludgeoning.
Final kill in his cycle?

135
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,924
And he's repeating his pattern
from 30 years ago,

136
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,010
so if we can find where
he bludgeoned back then...

137
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:17,681
Then maybe we can keep the next Trinity
victim from becoming the next Trinity victim.

138
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:21,560
Where's Masuka?

139
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,437
On vacation?

140
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:27,441
He's probably in Mexico
taking a donkey show tour.

141
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,860
There's a briefing in five minutes.

142
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:30,945
Agent Lundy...

143
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,655
My visitor's badge has expired?

144
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:34,365
Sorry.

145
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:38,118
Crap. Fuck.

146
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:41,455
I guess we'll have to stake out potential
bludgeoning sites on my off hours.

147
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,123
Hey.

148
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,918
I don't want this theory of mine
to jeopardize your job.

149
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,962
I want in on this.

150
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:52,091
- Well, OK, then.
- OK, then.

151
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,935
You ever feel like you're this close
to nabbing somebody?

152
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,771
Sometime in the next 67 hours.

153
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,441
It's a good feeling.

154
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:31,505
Oh, my God!
I can't believe he posted that.

155
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,757
- You are so busted.
- I'm busted?

156
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:37,428
OK, it's totally Photoshopped.
The point is it looks real, so...

157
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,305
You're busted!

158
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:40,764
Shh!

159
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,701
I know, I know, my dick's been making
some bad decisions.

160
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,788
So according to Quinn's girlfriend,

161
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:10,711
these Vacation Murders are costing the city
900,000 tourist dollars a day.

162
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:13,547
Well, at least the article
got the tip line ringing.

163
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,759
Those assholes can't hide with
all those eyes on them.

164
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:19,345
Well, those eyes are on us too.

165
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,681
Uh-oh.

166
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:25,642
What "Oh"?

167
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:28,562
That sigh thing
you do when, you know,

168
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:32,191
- there's something I'm not gonna like.
- I don't do a sigh thing.

169
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,610
OK, you don't.

170
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,739
What was it that you were gonna say?

171
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:47,915
I think we should inform the brass
about our relationship.

172
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,125
Look, it's just a formality.

173
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,836
Paperwork.
Entirely confidential.

174
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:57,132
- It's none of their business.
- It's department policy for good reason.

175
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,802
We will catch these killers,

176
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:02,096
and the defense attorney
could use the details

177
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:05,140
of an off-the-books romance between us
to sensationalize the case,

178
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,142
- distract the jury...
- If they find out.

179
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,563
On a death penalty case?

180
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,109
OK, they will find out.

181
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,402
But not for a while.

182
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:19,238
And what would we even
report to the brass?

183
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:22,699
- Well, that we're seeing each other.
- What does that mean?

184
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:28,622
- What do you think it means?
- It means it's new.

185
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,542
We're still figuring it out.

186
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:35,295
- So this could just be a passing thing.
- No, it's not a passing thing.

187
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:36,463
Then what is it?

188
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:44,430
- I don't know.
- Well, I don't know either.

189
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,600
- I'm confused.
- Yeah. I can see that.

190
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:54,523
Can we just... wait?

191
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,318
Fine.

192
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,793
As a cop, Zoey has been
to plenty of crime scenes.

193
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,796
She knows what should be there
and what shouldn't.

194
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:23,302
No prints in the blood on the door,
which means she wore gloves.

195
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,894
She was still wearing gloves
when she shot herself,

196
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,688
but they were gone
when the EMTs arrived.

197
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,441
Where'd you leave
those gloves, Zoey?

198
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,318
Easier to think here, isn't it?

199
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:45,866
Only 52 hours of freedom left.

200
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,368
You sure chose an interesting person
to spend it on.

201
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:51,997
Don't read anything into it.
Zoey was a challenge, that's all.

202
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,418
A woman who wiped out her own family
in order to be free.

203
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:02,049
She should have shot herself
instead of her husband and child.

204
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:05,260
Yeah. Except that doesn't get her free.

205
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,762
Just dead.

206
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:08,889
Well, she had other options.

207
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,766
Alimony. Visitation.

208
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:14,394
Trading off holidays,
there go your weekends.

209
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:16,939
Fine. She could have moved away.

210
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:19,441
And forfeit her job?
Her home?

211
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,361
Her only option
was to make her vacation

212
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,571
from her family
as permanent as possible.

213
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,532
There are always alternatives.

214
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,912
Why do you think
Trinity's been so successful?

215
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,623
He travels a lot.

216
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,041
Stays on the move.

217
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:37,876
He doesn't have a family.

218
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:40,671
Well, I do.

219
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,382
Miss them yet?

220
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:50,055
All right, Trinity used a hammer
in Portland and in Fresno,

221
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,516
but wasn't it a tire iron
in Albuquerque?

222
00:14:57,438 --> 00:15:02,192
OK, all right. We'll go with the dude
that was pulverized by the hammer.

223
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,486
Where was that?

224
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:09,074
OK, what time tomorrow?
Great.

225
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:14,621
- Pad Thai, my favorite.
- Mmm.

226
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:18,125
- How's Frank Lundy?
- I didn't say that was Lundy.

227
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:19,376
Oh, your voice did.

228
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:21,753
It goes up a notch every time
you talk to him,

229
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,131
which you're doing a lot of lately.

230
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,382
Your point?

231
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:28,218
I get a gig in town
to spend more time with you.

232
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:32,264
You spend all your time with your ex.

233
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:37,019
Our relationship
is strictly professional.

234
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,614
You twist your hair
when you talk to him.

235
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:53,827
You have nothing to be jealous of
when it comes to Frank Lundy.

236
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,120
All right?

237
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,134
Poker night at home.

238
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,638
Zoey's police family surrounds her
on and off the job.

239
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,974
Between her buddy system
and her security system,

240
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,810
her house will be difficult
to break in tonight.

241
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:23,315
But not tomorrow.

242
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,524
Cunt.

243
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,568
What the hell did you just say?

244
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,612
You're a cunt!

245
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:14,074
Fuck off, old man.

246
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,200
Fucking pussy!

247
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,959
You looking to get
the shit kicked out of you?

248
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,088
Faggot!

249
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:36,263
You gonna shut up now?

250
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:37,597
Faggot.

251
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:38,724
Faggot.

252
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,653
It's your fault.

253
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:54,322
The fuck is wrong with you?

254
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:56,783
All your fault.

255
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:08,795
The living room is here to the left,
kitchen in the back,

256
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,589
and way out back is the hot tub.

257
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,760
Ah, welcome, welcome, welcome.

258
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:17,179
Oh, you're gonna love this house.

259
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:21,767
Newer construction,
only one previous owner,

260
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:23,643
all sorts of upgrades.

261
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,188
Come on, let me show you
its special wonders.

262
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,984
Uh, would it be all right if I discovered
those special wonders on my own?

263
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,487
Any questions, just holler.

264
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:38,325
I do have one question:

265
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,410
where did Zoey stash her gloves?

266
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:44,414
I'm sure they're long gone,
but they could have left trace evidence.

267
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:48,460
She swiped the door
with blood here.

268
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:53,590
Shoots herself, collapses.

269
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:57,344
Crawls toward the kitchen to call 911.

270
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,854
Did she burn them?

271
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,191
If the gloves melted, there would be residue
on the underside of the grate.

272
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:15,821
It's just for show.

273
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:18,949
Who needs a fire in this climate?

274
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:21,910
- I'm Zoey. I live here.
- Hey.

275
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:24,579
I just thought I'd stop by,
see how the open house was going.

276
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,706
Oh. It's a nice place.

277
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:27,791
Thanks.

278
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,042
Family friendly.

279
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,335
Mm.

280
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:34,464
I'll be glad to give you a tour
if you're interested.

281
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:37,884
Very interested.

282
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:41,346
OK, follow me.

283
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,895
Wow, my daughter would
go crazy over this room.

284
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,565
It's a little girl's dream.

285
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,358
May I ask why you're selling?

286
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:56,778
My husband and I are separated.

287
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,572
Now our daughter's with him.

288
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,866
So you're single.

289
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,326
I am.

290
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:07,706
You've been married long?

291
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:11,001
Uh, yes, about six months.

292
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:15,005
Uh... That came out wrong.

293
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:16,798
I understand.

294
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,300
Believe me.

295
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:21,887
Zoey, there's a couple here
who have a question about the hot tub.

296
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:23,221
OK, I'll be right down.

297
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:28,059
- To be continued.
- Sure.

298
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:37,402
A little girl's dream.

299
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,742
Follow the blood.

300
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:46,578
Follow the blood...

301
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,789
Zoey crawled into the kitchen,

302
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,208
grabbed the counter to pull herself up,

303
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:54,377
then reached for the phone,

304
00:20:54,503 --> 00:21:00,050
giving her a perfect opportunity...
to use the garbage disposal.

305
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,941
How we doing in here?

306
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:18,777
Uh, there seems to be
a problem with the disposal.

307
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:20,779
Oh. Oh.

308
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,450
Oh, no, no, no.

309
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:28,203
It's probably just something jammed
in there. It's an easy fix.

310
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:29,412
Let me take a look.

311
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,790
- You'd do that?
- Sure.

312
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,985
Blue nitrile. The same material
found in police protective gloves.

313
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:05,782
If the glove fits...

314
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:18,920
Isn't he a doll? Fixing the disposal.

315
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:22,215
Huh. Wasn't broken this morning.

316
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,717
Give it a try.

317
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,010
All right.

318
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,096
Yay!

319
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,601
If I was your wife,

320
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,145
I'd hang on to you.

321
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,189
You're so... handy.

322
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:48,158
So it's either the cannery bludgeoning
or the bar beating.

323
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,702
The cannery body was a dump.

324
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:52,245
Trinity's not a dumper.

325
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,789
He picks a location,
takes his victims there.

326
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:56,750
So it's the bar.

327
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:58,043
Hmm.

328
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,087
Fuckin' A.

329
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:04,382
We've found Trinity's
30-year-old kill site.

330
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,927
- Oh! Oh, no, oh!
- Here, here, here.

331
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:11,014
- Fuck me.
- Take the file, take the file.

332
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,557
No harm.

333
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:15,518
Um... Mind if I...?

334
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:18,104
Yeah, sure, why don't you?

335
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:30,075
So, uh, 30 years ago,

336
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:32,494
a father of two
was bludgeoned to death

337
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,288
between the hours
of 7 and 10 p.m.

338
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:38,208
in the bathroom of Murphy's Tavern.

339
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:40,251
Which is where I'll be today.

340
00:23:41,212 --> 00:23:42,420
Me too.

341
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,215
Won't that be a problem with Ashton?

342
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:47,884
Anton.

343
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,386
And, no, he's cool.

344
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,430
Sort of.

345
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:55,475
Sort of?

346
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,852
He gets jealous for no reason.

347
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,731
He's a smart man.

348
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:09,280
Look...

349
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,325
don't make me come up
with thought bubbles

350
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:15,578
to put over those silent looks of yours.

351
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:18,957
Just say what you're thinking.

352
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:22,252
All right.

353
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:26,631
I, uh...

354
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:28,967
I thought I could keep my feelings for you

355
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:31,636
as background noise
to this investigation.

356
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:35,140
But, in working with you...

357
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:39,602
that noise has gotten...

358
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:43,815
Loud?

359
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:47,318
Deafening.

360
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,614
But they're my feelings.

361
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,076
Yup.

362
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:59,747
They're your feelings.

363
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:02,959
You're in a committed relationship.

364
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:05,837
I am.

365
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:09,841
And I would hate to...

366
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,511
I'd hate that too.

367
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,765
Jesus.

368
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,981
I've gotta go.

369
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:32,697
Will I see you tonight?

370
00:25:34,742 --> 00:25:36,618
I don't...

371
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:40,163
Fuck!

372
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:52,175
Is there a break
in the Vacation Murders case?

373
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:55,094
I'm having intimate relations with LaGuerta.

374
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:58,806
Congratulations?

375
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:00,350
I need some advice.

376
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:04,687
Huh, lot of wise people out there.

377
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:08,441
I don't trust anyone else
with this secret.

378
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,443
That's too bad.

379
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,613
Maria has awakened...

380
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:15,156
mi pasión.

381
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:16,282
Right.

382
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,409
When I'm with her,
I feel like a man.

383
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:21,913
Like my heart is blossoming.

384
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,915
- That's a problem?
- No.

385
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:28,461
The problem is she wants to disclose
our relationship to the higher-ups,

386
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:31,464
which I-I understand is a formality.

387
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,508
I just hate the thought
of them knowing.

388
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:37,095
- Because you're embarrassed.
- No.

389
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:40,306
Because once you define it, it's defined.

390
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,434
It's-it's-it's officially official.

391
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,228
- You're her boyfriend.
- Exactly.

392
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,981
Next thing you know,
you're moving in, your life is gone,

393
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:51,651
and it's just kids
and neighbors and painted mugs.

394
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:55,154
- Painted mugs?
- It's a metaphor.

395
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:56,698
For what?

396
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:58,616
Look, if you want out, get out.

397
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:01,995
Before you have to do
something drastic.

398
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:04,998
I don't want out. I don't.

399
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:07,041
I just want to protect it

400
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,626
by keeping it private.

401
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,295
Yeah.

402
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:12,547
Who knew it would matter
so much to me?

403
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,008
Thanks, socio.

404
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:17,802
I'll keep you posted on the details.

405
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,847
Great.

406
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,314
I am a stickler for details.

407
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:34,861
You still dating
that she-bag reporter?

408
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:37,030
- Is it that hard for you to get laid?
- I'm not...

409
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:39,532
After she put Lundy's name in the paper
and ruined everything?

410
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,701
I'm not seeing her.

411
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:43,411
Maybe you should have told her that.

412
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:45,621
Newsflash, Quinn:
you're an idiot.

413
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,626
Yeah, I got your messages.

414
00:27:50,753 --> 00:27:52,712
But you didn't call me back.

415
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:55,256
Tell me, is this conversation
gonna end up in the paper too?

416
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,216
You have no idea the shitstorm
you've got me into.

417
00:27:57,343 --> 00:27:59,218
I'm sorry.

418
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:01,429
Really, but...

419
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:03,348
we can work this out.

420
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,684
I'm not interested in working it out.

421
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:08,728
Don't say that.

422
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:12,065
Come on, it's not like
this was a big deal.

423
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:15,860
Don't you dare tell me
there's nothing here.

424
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:21,908
You're right, I won't.

425
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,327
But it's way too complicated.

426
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:30,416
- I don't want to lose you.
- Christine.

427
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,001
You never had me.

428
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:34,212
Find yourself another source.

429
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:47,934
On vacation,
we buy snow globes,

430
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,895
send postcards to preserve
the good times,

431
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:52,688
remind us where we've been.

432
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:58,444
Zoey's crime scene
had its own memento...

433
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:03,241
a glove whose rolled cuff preserved
the gunshot residue after she shot herself.

434
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,788
And blood.

435
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:11,207
Odds are it belongs
to the late Darius Rae.

436
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:15,128
Ah, Zoey, wish you were here.

437
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:16,754
But since you're not...

438
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:19,799
I'll come to you.

439
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:24,929
I should get to Pembroke Pines
just in time to follow Officer Kruger home.

440
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:30,309
Original structure
was a single-story tavern.

441
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,021
Current building:

442
00:29:34,148 --> 00:29:36,524
12 floors, mostly vacant.

443
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:58,921
I'm found.

444
00:30:18,609 --> 00:30:23,029
Lobby's open 24 hours, guard on duty,
too much foot traffic.

445
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:25,364
Trinity would have to choose another floor.

446
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:28,993
Ooh! Uh, I'm so sorry.
I wasn't watching where I was going.

447
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:31,329
No damage done.

448
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:43,090
Excuse me.

449
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:49,555
You dropped these.

450
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,015
Thanks.

451
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:10,743
Bus number 432.

452
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,621
White male, maybe 6'4",

453
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:16,374
200, 220 pounds,

454
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,292
age around 60,

455
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:21,420
hair gray, eyes blue...

456
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:24,590
something in them.

457
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,600
Maybe I do miss Rita and the kids...

458
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,353
Hello?

459
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:38,604
Hi, it's me.

460
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,231
Oh, uh, hey, guys, keep it down.

461
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:41,774
I was just checking in.

462
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,694
Oh, we have the rehearsal dinner
in 20 minutes and...

463
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,737
Astor, your dress
is getting wrinkled.

464
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,281
Sounds like you got your hands...

465
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:50,741
Cody, put your shoes on.
I'm sorry, what were you saying?

466
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:53,035
I was just saying
you probably have your hands...

467
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:56,122
- Mom, Cody pulled my barrettes out.
- It was an accident.

468
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:58,165
You took them
right off my head.

469
00:31:58,292 --> 00:32:00,793
I'm sorry, I didn't hear
what you were saying.

470
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,128
It was nothing.

471
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:04,672
Uh, we gotta go. Love you.

472
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:06,007
Me...

473
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:07,466
...too.

474
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:17,476
Shit.

475
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:19,979
Going the speed limit,
hands-free dialing,

476
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:21,147
no violations.

477
00:32:33,744 --> 00:32:35,494
This is bad.

478
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:36,954
What a coincidence.

479
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,790
Out of the vehicle, please.

480
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:46,505
Hands on the hood, please.

481
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:55,181
My wife and I changed our mind
about buying a house.

482
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:57,808
Dexter Morgan.

483
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:03,773
You didn't mention that
you were a, uh, spatter analyst,

484
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:05,941
Miami Metro.

485
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:09,820
Didn't seem relevant
to house hunting.

486
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:12,615
Hmm.

487
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,370
Well, the file clerk at my station,

488
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:19,121
he's a friend.

489
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,082
He told me that Sam
had pulled my case file,

490
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:24,251
and Sam told me
he'd loaned it to a colleague.

491
00:33:24,378 --> 00:33:28,172
You can imagine my surprise when I looked
up that colleague and saw your face.

492
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:31,550
I am writing a paper
on blood swipes.

493
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:35,012
- Are you getting off on this?
- Am I supposed to be?

494
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:38,641
Are you the kind of sicko
who likes watching a woman in pain?

495
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:42,812
Not that kind of sicko, no.

496
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,023
I lost my husband.

497
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,861
I watched my child die
in front of me.

498
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:54,365
Do you have any idea
how agonizing that was?

499
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,284
Agony would be
the normal reaction.

500
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:01,038
I will not let that wound be reopened.

501
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:06,585
Do you understand?

502
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:16,262
Traffic's heavy on Brickell.

503
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:18,305
Might want to avoid it
on your way home.

504
00:34:18,432 --> 00:34:19,724
Was, uh...

505
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:22,435
3319 Meadow Lane, right?

506
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:25,646
I'm letting you off with a warning.

507
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:29,191
Drive carefully.

508
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,368
I'm calling it off.

509
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:40,953
You can't.

510
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,122
She knows who you are.

511
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:46,000
She knows who Dexter Morgan,
lab geek, is.

512
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:47,585
She knows where you live,

513
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:50,713
where your wife and children will be
when they get home in 48 hours.

514
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:53,340
If I back off, she backs off.

515
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,135
Still leaves you
on the radar of a killer cop

516
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:58,471
who has no qualms
about shooting her family,

517
00:34:58,597 --> 00:34:59,972
much less a lab rat.

518
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:03,642
She's stalking me. Taking her by surprise
will be out of the question.

519
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:06,645
You're the one
who wanted a challenge.

520
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,985
And now you've batted the beehive.

521
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:15,988
Dexter, Frank Lundy here.

522
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,490
Sorry to bother you at home.

523
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:19,492
Just trying to reach your sister.

524
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:21,118
Thought she was maybe with you.

525
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,788
I had an interesting encounter today.

526
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:27,541
Me too.

527
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:37,426
Gotta admit, she is impressive.

528
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:40,846
Makes you wonder why someone like her

529
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,474
ever got married and had kids
in the first place.

530
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,184
Someone like her?

531
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:51,148
Someone like her
needs to be in control.

532
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:55,694
And if she thinks she is...

533
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:58,781
She won't see me coming.

534
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:07,373
Pembroke Pines
Police Department.

535
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:08,874
Records, please?

536
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,875
Transferring.

537
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:14,463
Records, Langsbury speaking.

538
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:17,675
Uh, yeah, this is Miami Metro Forensics.

539
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:21,554
I wanted to request copies
of a suspect's file.

540
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,264
Suspect's name?

541
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:25,391
Uh, Darius Rae.

542
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:27,309
That's Rae with an "e".

543
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:31,021
Drug dealer and alleged killer
of Zoey Kruger's family.

544
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,315
What is this in regard to?

545
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:36,902
Uh... It involves the Vacation Murders case.

546
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:39,822
I'll send the file over.

547
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:41,407
To whose attention?

548
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:45,244
Just, uh, Forensics.

549
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:51,125
Batting the beehive.

550
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:00,217
Dexter.

551
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:10,936
I know everything.

552
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:14,023
I'm gonna choose
not to misinterpret that.

553
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:16,734
When Angel said
he told you about us, I was...

554
00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:19,486
angry, to say the least.

555
00:37:19,613 --> 00:37:22,406
I really didn't want to know.

556
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:24,950
- But now you do.
- Yeah.

557
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:29,872
Actually, I'm glad because I could really use
a man's opinion on how to handle...

558
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:32,791
our relationship.

559
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:37,379
Or fling, or whatever it is
that he and I are doing naked.

560
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:41,258
Well, I was just going to lunch.

561
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:42,635
That's great.

562
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:47,014
Beth's café sound good?

563
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:50,893
Oh, actually, we should... just talk here.

564
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:55,105
- It's more private.
- Yeah.

565
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:03,072
Angel's a great cop.
The best I know.

566
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:06,367
But he doesn't understand
the politics in this building.

567
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:10,788
And we have to manage
how this thing becomes public.

568
00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:13,415
And if it's handled wrong,
our jobs could be at risk.

569
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:16,961
And we can't take that chance.

570
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,006
I...

571
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,217
Never leave anything to chance.

572
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:30,891
Thank you.

573
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:33,936
You're getting good
at this relationship stuff.

574
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:37,147
Mm, marriage agrees with you.

575
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,108
Thank you.

576
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:46,615
Lundy called last night.
He was trying to reach you.

577
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:50,869
That is just so...

578
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,664
fucking great.

579
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:57,668
OK.

580
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:13,475
Looks like the beehive is buzzing.

581
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,728
And here comes the sting.

582
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:39,376
You're out of your jurisdiction,
Officer Kruger.

583
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:54,475
Wait for it.

584
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,524
W-w-what are you doing?

585
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,193
You want info on Darius Rae?

586
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:05,402
Ask me anything.

587
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:07,362
That file was for a case I'm working.

588
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:10,282
I asked you nicely

589
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,784
to leave me alone.

590
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,452
You threatened me.

591
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:17,915
- You think that was a threat?
- What, are you gonna murder me too?

592
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:20,459
Like you murdered your family?

593
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,631
Your own daughter?

594
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:28,050
- You're sick.
- I know what you did.

595
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:29,885
I have proof.

596
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,222
Not possible.

597
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:36,600
From the garbage disposal,
the gloves you wore that night.

598
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:38,894
There was gun residue on them.

599
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,522
I have a meeting with
my superiors tomorrow morning

600
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:43,315
to tell them everything.

601
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,653
There's no chain of custody.

602
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:49,696
Still, it'll raise questions.

603
00:40:49,823 --> 00:40:53,575
And if you left this much behind,
we'll find something else.

604
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:06,171
You're trying to rape me.

605
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:09,925
I'm not touching you.

606
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:13,512
That's why you came to my house.

607
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:18,100
And the real estate agent will testify
that you were flirting with me.

608
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:22,104
And then you stalked me here
and tried to assault me.

609
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,649
- And I had to defend myself.
- Except...

610
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:29,027
the blowback of my blood
into the muzzle of your gun

611
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:34,366
will show a flat contact shot
that's highly unlikely during a struggle.

612
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:36,326
Mm.

613
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:41,039
You could shoot me center mass,

614
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:45,335
but the low directionality will show
I was in a defensive position.

615
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:48,380
You'd have to calculate
the exact distance

616
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:52,676
to create a spatter pattern
that supports self-defense.

617
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:00,100
Go ahead.

618
00:42:00,894 --> 00:42:02,060
Tell them.

619
00:42:03,897 --> 00:42:06,899
No one is going to believe you

620
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:08,942
over me.

621
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:13,238
So please...

622
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:15,240
tell them...

623
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,034
everything.

624
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,876
You won't give me the chance.

625
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:31,048
I'm counting on it.

626
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:42,976
Debra.

627
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,520
You're here.

628
00:42:45,647 --> 00:42:48,065
- I called because, Trinity, I think...
- Shut up.

629
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:06,291
This time she won't come in a squad car.

630
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:09,503
This time it won't be about
threats and intimidation.

631
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:12,214
This time, it's for real.

632
00:43:16,678 --> 00:43:18,178
They're all props,

633
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:20,472
the camouflage of a family man.

634
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,517
She'll believe them.

635
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:27,437
She has no idea who I am,

636
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:29,231
but I know exactly who she is.

637
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:32,317
Marco...

638
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:37,698
...Polo.

639
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:48,041
She's going to make it look like
I walked in on a home robbery,

640
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:50,210
got myself killed.

641
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:52,838
She's good at creating
the narrative of a crime.

642
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:16,653
That hand's the first thing I cut off.

643
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:33,837
Surprise.

644
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:05,369
Help. Help!

645
00:45:05,495 --> 00:45:07,037
Help!

646
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:10,082
Sorry, sorry, I was just
buying your tickets.

647
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:12,584
You're taking a boat out of the country.

648
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,921
Eventually you'll land
in the Philippines.

649
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:18,715
You're smart.
There's no extradition treaty there.

650
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:21,385
I'm not going anywhere.

651
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:27,766
I know something about
creating a narrative too.

652
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:31,686
Suitcases packed,
your car will be left at the port,

653
00:45:31,813 --> 00:45:35,690
and the blue glove
is back in your disposal.

654
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:37,609
You'll flee the country.

655
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,069
Pshoo!

656
00:45:40,113 --> 00:45:42,280
Never be caught.

657
00:45:42,407 --> 00:45:43,907
You're that good.

658
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:47,369
Or that dead.

659
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:49,621
You're gonna rape and kill me?

660
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:54,292
What is it with you and rape?
No one's raping anyone.

661
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:56,211
Mm, killing on the other hand...

662
00:45:58,256 --> 00:46:00,799
Why are you doing this to me?

663
00:46:01,968 --> 00:46:03,885
Why did you do this to them?

664
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:07,055
It was Darius Rae.

665
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:09,307
No, you wanted out.

666
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:12,811
You wanted your freedom

667
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:16,106
from the constant demands.

668
00:46:17,233 --> 00:46:18,525
They took it all,

669
00:46:18,651 --> 00:46:20,318
and they wanted more.

670
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,282
I couldn't breathe.

671
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:27,576
You did it to survive.

672
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:32,205
You understand.

673
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:36,751
I understand, all right.

674
00:46:47,096 --> 00:46:48,388
Look at you.

675
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:52,809
What kind of father does this?

676
00:46:53,728 --> 00:46:55,395
What kind of husband?

677
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:04,613
Not the kind who kills his family.

678
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:18,960
You're going to have to choose.

679
00:47:20,129 --> 00:47:21,796
Not what you chose.

680
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:26,885
You can't hide what you are.

681
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,221
Oh, I can.

682
00:47:29,347 --> 00:47:31,014
I'm better at it than you.

683
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:35,143
You will choose
your life over theirs.

684
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:36,603
I won't.

685
00:47:36,729 --> 00:47:39,064
I'd rather risk them knowing the truth...

686
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:43,527
than lose them.

687
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:51,910
Wow, wow.

688
00:47:56,499 --> 00:47:57,832
Oh.

689
00:47:57,959 --> 00:47:59,626
I don't want to lose them.

690
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:04,172
I don't.

691
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:11,555
That's the difference between us.

692
00:48:24,694 --> 00:48:26,361
Nice souvenir.

693
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:38,290
Sure you don't want to stay here?

694
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:41,418
You didn't raise a loner, Dad.

695
00:48:42,295 --> 00:48:43,962
Maybe I should have.

696
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:47,340
I'll survive.

697
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:49,384
You sure?

698
00:48:53,264 --> 00:48:55,307
Better see to that drip, son.

699
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:57,642
You don't want this place
going to hell.

700
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,060
You need it too much.

701
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:01,146
My own little vacation spot.

702
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:07,736
Hey, how you guys
doing up there?

703
00:49:07,862 --> 00:49:10,238
We're on our way.
We left right after the wedding.

704
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:11,573
We should be home soon.

705
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:13,074
Good, I'm glad.

706
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,868
The house!

707
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,871
Don't hurry. Drive safe.

708
00:49:52,448 --> 00:49:53,823
You're home!

709
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:55,784
Yeah, we made it.

710
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:57,535
The wedding was exhausting.

711
00:49:57,662 --> 00:49:59,704
The kids were a nightmare.

712
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,498
I wanted to strangle them.

713
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:05,710
Oh, no.

714
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,587
Yeah, it just slipped out of my hand.

715
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:09,506
Sorry.

716
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:14,094
Oh, the kids will be excited
to make you a new one.

717
00:50:33,197 --> 00:50:34,698
Mmm.

718
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:38,201
I missed you so much.

719
00:50:41,706 --> 00:50:43,373
I missed you too.

720
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:17,574
I'm a fuckwad.

721
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:23,663
You're not a fuckwad.

722
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:28,042
I knew.

723
00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:33,423
From the second I saw you at the station,
I knew how I felt.

724
00:51:34,467 --> 00:51:36,551
It's how I've always felt.

725
00:51:36,677 --> 00:51:38,470
I just wouldn't admit it.

726
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:41,931
Because I'm a fuckwad.

727
00:51:44,977 --> 00:51:46,436
You're human.

728
00:51:48,147 --> 00:51:49,481
And now I've cheated on a guy

729
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:52,108
who doesn't deserve
to be treated that way.

730
00:51:53,611 --> 00:51:56,821
I should have broken up with him first.

731
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:59,657
- But I'm a fuckwad.
- No. Don't.

732
00:51:59,784 --> 00:52:01,451
You're not.

733
00:52:02,703 --> 00:52:04,162
You're beautiful.

734
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:07,582
And you were confused.

735
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:10,960
And now you're not.

736
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,172
So...

737
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:18,009
we'll set this right, together.

738
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:19,469
All right?

739
00:52:39,782 --> 00:52:42,158
Don't go disappearing on me again.

740
00:52:43,327 --> 00:52:45,119
Not a...

741
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:29,873
Stay with me.
