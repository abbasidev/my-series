1
00:00:02,044 --> 00:00:03,670
Previously on Dexter.

2
00:00:03,796 --> 00:00:04,796
Deb's alive.

3
00:00:04,922 --> 00:00:07,048
- They're taking her to the hospital.
- Who did this?

4
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:09,258
He says it's smelling like
the Vacation Murderer's MO.

5
00:00:09,385 --> 00:00:10,718
- Then that's...
- Lundy.

6
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:13,054
Lundy devoted his life
to hunting Trinity.

7
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,891
If it was Trinity, it would explain
why Deb is alive and Lundy isn't.

8
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:20,269
I'm gonna follow Lundy's theory
and check his hotel room for clues.

9
00:00:20,396 --> 00:00:22,355
You can't let these be logged
into evidence.

10
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:26,943
I just unsealed the juvy records

11
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:29,445
of Johnny Rose,
our Vacation Murder suspect.

12
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,781
Shoplifting with his high-school
girlfriend Nikki Wald.

13
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:35,952
Nikki! Put the gun down.

14
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:39,956
- We got 'em, Morgan.
- Got who?

15
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:42,750
Nikki Wald and Johnny Rose. Well, we got
Nikki. Johnny's on his way to the morgue.

16
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,044
This department can't risk
a defense attorney

17
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,796
turning your romantic involvement

18
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:48,965
into a courtroom sideshow
every time you work a case together.

19
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:50,258
What are you saying?

20
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:53,136
I am saying I need you to transfer
Sergeant Batista out of Homicide.

21
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:54,554
This is bullshit.

22
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,515
I would have been here sooner,
but I got hung up on the phone.

23
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:59,809
- Your landlord called.
- Oh.

24
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:03,020
I was just hanging on to the place
until the lease ran out.

25
00:01:03,147 --> 00:01:04,647
Why'd you tell me you got rid of it?

26
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:08,401
So you didn't have an affair
with my father?

27
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:11,654
I don't know who you're looking for,
honey, but it ain't me.

28
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,240
I'm halfway through
the CI files you gave me.

29
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:16,659
Maybe then I'll finally get
some answers.

30
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:19,454
- Can I help you?
- I'm taking on a project.

31
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,165
I'd go with the framing hammer.

32
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:26,294
You made me do this.

33
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:32,675
What are you doing?

34
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:36,304
He doesn't belong here.
It doesn't make sense.

35
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:41,225
Trinity's a husband, a father.

36
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:43,686
He's...

37
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,229
like me.

38
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:35,172
♪ Have you been to Jesus

39
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:37,633
♪ For the cleansing power?

40
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,760
♪ Are you washed in the blood

♪ Lay aside the garments

00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:55,234
♪ That are stained with sin...

48
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,653
A wolf in sheep's clothing.

49
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:01,073
Hour by hour, the spitting image
of a normal man.

50
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:03,910
Up at 6 a.m.

51
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,747
Breakfast, 7 a.m.

52
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,458
Work, 8:30.

53
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:13,461
Study session.
Shaping young minds.

54
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,212
Even on a Saturday.

55
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:17,506
Noon lunch with faculty.

56
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:20,551
Out at 3:00. Dinner at 6:00.

57
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:24,430
Father, husband, teacher, deacon.

58
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:27,683
All in the name of blending in.

59
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,853
Camouflage is nature's craftiest trick.

60
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:37,777
This is what makes a home -

61
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:39,987
the noise of happy children,

62
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,698
the warmth of a full house,

63
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,910
the chill of an angry wife.

64
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,829
That the last of it?

65
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,834
- Just a few more things to pack up.
- Not like you're dragging it out.

66
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,461
Uh, that's for the kids.

67
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:58,339
If you're hungry,
there's food in the fridge.

68
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:02,510
- Oh, I could go for a sandwich.
- We're out of bread.

69
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:06,389
She has to forgive me for my apartment
eventually. Doesn't she?

70
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:12,728
Maybe I should hang on to it
just in case, huh?

71
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:19,151
This is so awesome.

72
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,903
- Hello?
- Dexter.

73
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,490
- Out of the way.
- Sheesh.

74
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:38,254
I made an appointment

75
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,715
with the new therapist
for tomorrow at noon.

76
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,551
- New therapist?
- It's an emergency, Dexter.

77
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,761
Or don't you think so?

78
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,973
No, of course.
I mean, whatever you need.

79
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,144
This isn't for me. This is for us.

80
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,939
This doesn't belong here.

81
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:08,826
Hey, can you give me
a ride to the station?

82
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,245
Batista's taking another run
at Nikki Wald today.

83
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,707
She confessed to everything except for
the part where she shot me and Lundy.

84
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,710
Because she didn't. Trinity did.
But I can't tell Deb.

85
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:20,254
I need a head start.

86
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:24,884
Morgan.
Yes, I know where that is.

87
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,969
Thanks.

88
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,472
Got to go. Bludgeoning downtown.

89
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:32,141
Trinity's latest victim. About time.

90
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:34,560
100 Ocean Gate?

91
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,981
Yeah. How'd you know that?

92
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:42,359
Because that's where Lundy
thought it would be.

93
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:43,819
We could have stopped it

94
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:47,573
if fucking Nikki Wald and her
shitstain boyfriend didn't shoot us.

95
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:49,992
Deb, it's gonna be OK.

96
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,952
I'm going to kill Trinity for you.

97
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:56,457
Can you just give me a ride
to the station, please?

98
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,293
Yeah, I'll drop you off
on my way downtown. Come on.

99
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:13,140
The last victim
in the cycle of three.

100
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,684
Trinity's done...

101
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:17,812
for now.

102
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,982
He's retreated
to the safety of his camouflage.

103
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:25,486
His defenses will be down.
Perfect time to strike.

104
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,988
Oh. Jesus.

105
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:30,241
I just have to stay ahead
of my colleagues.

106
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:33,285
Two days' worth of decay.
The body's been here since Friday.

107
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,746
Building was closed
over the weekend. No a/c.

108
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,957
What's the spatter say?

109
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,708
Blunt force trauma to the head.

110
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:41,418
Duh.

111
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:45,047
Judging from the spray, we're looking
at somebody tall, over six feet.

112
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,799
That all you got?

113
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,677
That's all I can tell ya.

114
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:09,113
He moved the arm for a reason.

115
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,371
Can't leave this behind.

116
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,665
It might get them closer.

117
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,546
- Give me.
- That's OK. I got it.

118
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,882
Evidence hog. You got buckets
of blood to worry about.

119
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:34,471
See the oval grid pattern there?

120
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:36,432
Comes from a framing hammer.

121
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:38,267
Duh.

122
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:42,521
I'll check some out in the spatter room.
See if I can narrow it down.

123
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:45,274
How do you know
so much about hammers?

124
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,736
Not a tool I haven't
played with, my friend.

125
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:15,512
OK, the FBI agent,
he was shot at a business hotel.

126
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,264
But you were so high,
you don't even remember, do you?

127
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,850
No, no, no. No.
I never blacked out. Never.

128
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,519
Bullshit, you fucking junkie whore.

129
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:24,647
Do you remember shooting at...

130
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,816
- Quinn.
- You shouldn't be here, Morgan.

131
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:30,694
- Watching this is only gonna fuck you up.
- I'm already fucked up.

132
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,696
Look, Nikki's going away
for a long time.

133
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,740
She confessed to the Vacation Murders
and to killing Johnny Rose.

134
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:36,325
But not to Lundy.

135
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,661
The whole department
knows she's lying, but we got nothing.

136
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:42,039
No evidence, no eyewitnesses,
so it is what it is.

137
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:51,465
Fuck.

138
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,717
Fuck.

139
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,847
I came at Nikki Wald
from every which way,

140
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:00,349
but she's still holding out on us.

141
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:04,061
Brass wants her transferred to County,
so it's out of our hands.

142
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:05,354
Shit.

143
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,066
I didn't want to leave Homicide
with Deb and Lundy unsolved.

144
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,943
That's out of our hands too.

145
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:15,030
I haven't told anyone yet
about me transferring.

146
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,283
There's no need until it's official.

147
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:19,159
I haven't even turned in the paperwork.

148
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:20,703
Is that it?

149
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:23,372
No, that's a homicide.

150
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:24,873
Just come in today?

151
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,500
This morning.

152
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,092
Didn't make sense to call you in
on something new.

153
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:37,344
Bludgeoning. Nasty.

154
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,139
You got any leads?

155
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:46,061
Hey, if I'd known
you'd be transferred...

156
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,188
Maria, don't.

157
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,900
Telling Matthews about us
was the right thing to do.

158
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:53,694
Working fraud
will be good for me.

159
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,905
15% pay bump,
promotion to lieutenant, better hours,

160
00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:59,575
and chances are
I'm not gonna be getting shot at

161
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:01,702
sitting behind a desk all day.

162
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,538
You hate sitting behind a desk.

163
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,959
But I love being with you.

164
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,768
I'm perfectly comfortable
with bodily fluids -

165
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:28,062
blood, snot, tears.

166
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:31,065
But the emotions
that go along with them,

167
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,192
not so much.

168
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,613
Dexter, are you hearing
what Rita is saying?

169
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:42,910
She's upset.

170
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:49,958
About the apartment.

171
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:52,920
The apartment isn't really
the issue right now.

172
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,755
It's not?

173
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:58,425
You see? It's like he doesn't even listen.

174
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,178
He's always in his head,
and when he does talk to me,

175
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:02,971
it's all lies, all the time.

176
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:05,140
Not...

177
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,476
all the time.

178
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:09,353
I thought we were past this.

179
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:10,979
With the drugs and Lila...

180
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:13,148
- Who's Lila?
- My sponsor.

181
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,608
Homicidal bitch he slept with.

182
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,193
OK.

183
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,695
Now we're married.

184
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:22,991
You know, we have a child together.

185
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:24,785
And you're still keeping secrets.

186
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,496
Rita, I can see that you're upset.

187
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:30,749
But, as you describe it,

188
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,252
this isn't new behavior for Dexter.

189
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:35,838
What do you mean?

190
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:38,841
It sounds like you knew about him

191
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:40,384
when you married him.

192
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,054
But I hoped he would change.

193
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:48,767
When you married your ex-husband,
did you think he would change too?

194
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:56,775
OK. OK, so I have
some responsibility here too.

195
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:06,910
I don't want to keep making
the same mistakes.

196
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,579
Me neither.

197
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:11,832
We'll work it out.
We always work it out.

198
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:14,793
I need a partner, Dexter.

199
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,588
Someone I can trust.

200
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:20,841
Unless you can be
completely honest with me...

201
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,845
I don't want to do this anymore.

202
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:36,398
I'm doing everything I can
to save my family,

203
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,400
and I'm still failing.

204
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,777
Rita's picturing her life
without me,

205
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:45,073
and I can't picture mine without her...

206
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,034
or the kids.

207
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,244
Harrison.

208
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,663
Is that the hammer?

209
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,750
The depth is too shallow.
Murder weapon was heavier.

210
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:57,294
Well, narrow it down, Dex.
We need a model number.

211
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,963
Maybe we can track it
to a hardware store or an internet site.

212
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,548
I'll try the 22-ouncer.

213
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:08,430
What's going on?

214
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:09,890
DNA.

215
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:15,020
Whose DNA? The victim's?

216
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:16,730
- The killer's?
- Wait for it.

217
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:21,485
OK, that smudge you found
at the crime scene?

218
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:25,989
Cremated human remains.

219
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:29,159
That fragment
was a little piece of bone.

220
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,745
And thanks to the wonders
of technology

221
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,580
and to my own scientific prowess...

222
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,750
- You rehydrated it, and?
- Dude, I told you to wait for it.

223
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,295
And I found two strains of DNA.

224
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,797
One from the fragment

225
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:44,299
and one from saliva.

226
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,469
- Whose saliva?
- The killer's.

227
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,930
Come on, buddy. Try to keep up.

228
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:53,642
How do you think he got
the ashes to stick to the wall?

229
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:55,936
We got the killer's goddamn DNA?

230
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,479
You effin' know it.

231
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,565
- I rock, right?
- Yeah, you do today.

232
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,608
Run it through every database
you can think of.

233
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,860
- OK.
- We're gonna find this guy.

234
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:05,445
No, you won't.

235
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:08,031
Arthur Mitchell isn't in any
of our police databases.

236
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:11,660
I already ran him.
He's squeaky clean.

237
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,495
He hides the real him,

238
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:16,164
except from those ashes.

239
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,417
He can only be honest
with the dead.

240
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:29,761
Morgan. I need those
Vacation Murder files back.

241
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,180
- Got to finish my report.
- Just give me another hour.

242
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:34,808
There's got to be something
that puts Nikki at Lundy's hotel.

243
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,643
Morgan, we got it covered.

244
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,687
And you shouldn't
be working anyway.

245
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:41,356
You're on sick leave. Go home.

246
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,692
I'll keep you posted. OK?

247
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:55,495
One unheard message.

248
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:59,207
Hi, I'm calling for Debra Morgan.
This is Valerie Hodges returning your call

249
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:01,126
from a few weeks ago.

250
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:03,211
Sorry it took me so long to call you back,

251
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:05,714
but when you said you were
Harry Morgan's daughter,

252
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,424
I wasn't sure what to do.

253
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:11,470
I figured I'd just call, be direct,
so if you want to know the truth...

254
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:13,680
I told you to stop working.

255
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,975
That wasn't work.

256
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,436
- That was way personal.
- Come on.

257
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:21,772
For you? Same difference.

258
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,247
She wants a partner.

259
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:41,958
One who can open up.

260
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:44,169
OK, I'll share.

261
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:46,380
About what?

262
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,090
Work.

263
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:50,258
Spatter analysis?

264
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:52,594
No. Something personal.

265
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,763
Trinity? Mm, too personal.

266
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:58,600
Food? I'm hungry.
I could tell her that.

267
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,769
We're out of bread again.

268
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,855
I'll go get some.

269
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:21,790
Arthur's kept this up
for, what, 28 years?

270
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,917
My family may not last 20 minutes.

271
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,421
Warmth, intimacy.

272
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,297
He's convincing.

273
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:31,842
But why the show?
I'm the only one watching.

274
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:35,178
Unless it's more
than just camouflage.

275
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:40,016
That's honest affection

276
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:41,935
sustained for years.

277
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,564
But he's like me.
How does he do it?

278
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:51,820
I will kill him. I need to.

279
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:55,282
But right now
I need to save my family more.

280
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:59,619
His cycle is over. It'll be a while
before he kills again,

281
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:01,955
so he's not an immediate threat.

282
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,625
And I have so much to learn.

283
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:08,253
Arthur Mitchell.

284
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,718
Kyle Butler.

285
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:18,513
Four Walls, One Heart.
We build homes for the homeless.

286
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:21,516
We meet at my house,
then head to the site together.

287
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,935
- My address is right on the flyer.
- Thanks.

288
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:27,355
I've been looking for a way
to get more involved.

289
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:30,025
What brings you
to sacred fellowship, Kyle?

290
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:32,110
Um...

291
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:35,739
Looking for... something.

292
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:37,532
Answers.

293
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,163
My wife and I, we separated.

294
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,290
She kicked me out

295
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:48,043
and took the kids.

296
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:52,130
I didn't know where else to go.

297
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:56,343
You came to the right place, son.

298
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,440
I just got an email from my editor.

299
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,651
Yeah? Anything good?

300
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:15,529
Well, he wants more from me
on the Vacation Murders.

301
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:21,493
I'm not asking
for any inside scoop.

302
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:24,287
Yeah, 'cause we know how well
that worked out last time.

303
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:27,707
What?

304
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:32,712
If you could just help me
get an interview with Debra Morgan...

305
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,050
- You got to be kidding me.
- It'd be a hero piece, about the shooting.

306
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,593
No. No way.

307
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,136
She's your partner.

308
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:43,890
Yeah, add to that the fact that her brother
has a bug up his ass about me.

309
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:49,020
Let's just say I'd rather
you left it alone.

310
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,355
Oh.

311
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:55,068
Since when did that ever stop me
from getting what I want?

312
00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:00,365
Oh, hold on.
It might be the station.

313
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:03,952
Quinn.

314
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:06,079
Look out your window.

315
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,921
Be back in a sec, OK?

316
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,509
Hey.

317
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:23,263
I want to be an eyewitness
for the shooting.

318
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:28,143
I thought you said
you didn't see anything.

319
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:30,437
I was in shock.

320
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,439
My memory was fuzzy.

321
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,649
Now it's clear.

322
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,861
There's no doubt in my mind
that Nikki shot me and Frank.

323
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:40,822
Mine either. Are you talking
about going on the record?

324
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:44,284
And what happens later
if you decide you're still confused?

325
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:48,705
- I won't.
- You sure?

326
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:51,583
Because if this comes back
to bite you in the ass, you're screwed.

327
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:01,259
My dad used to say a good cop
does whatever it takes to close a case.

328
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:04,554
Other cops. Not you.

329
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:07,515
Just think about it, OK?

330
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:10,644
I'd hate to have you make a decision
when your head's not on straight.

331
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,201
They're on a wild goose chase.

332
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:29,329
No way they'll find a match
to Trinity's DNA.

333
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:31,164
He's too well hidden.

334
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,504
I could be helping,
finding the hammer he used.

335
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,632
Or I could help someone
in need - me.

336
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,228
Preliminary spatter report
on the bludgeoning.

337
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:55,647
We land on the specific hammer
for the murder weapon?

338
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:57,732
Narrowing it down.
I'll keep you posted.

339
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,068
I'm actually heading out now
to do some field research.

340
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:01,695
Well, how about you, Vince?

341
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,571
You got anything for me
on that DNA?

342
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:05,657
No matches
in the criminal database.

343
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:07,283
Duh.

344
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:08,868
Wait.

345
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:10,662
You're gonna miss the big reveal.

346
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,292
Because I'm me, and I happen
to think outside the box,

347
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:18,253
and I happen to be
an awesome forensic tech...

348
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:22,090
- Masuka.
- I ran the human remains against the saliva

349
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:23,967
and guess what I found.

350
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:26,261
Matching mitochondrial DNA.

351
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:27,637
English, porfavor.

352
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:32,726
The killer is related
to the human remains. Same family.

353
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:37,272
He keeps his family with him
all the time.

354
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:41,109
Well, are they gonna go visit him in prison?
'Cause this is going to get him caught.

355
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:43,445
- Maybe he wants to get caught.
- Or he's sending a message.

356
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:47,032
Or he's trying to leave
some kind of legacy.

357
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:50,618
Hey. How come you're
not working this case?

358
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,788
I'm busy.

359
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:56,082
Got a report to finish.

360
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:02,338
His family keeps him safe,
but these ashes leave him exposed.

361
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:04,424
Maybe this is
how I get to the truth.

362
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:09,763
The murder weapon.

363
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:13,099
He's using it out in the open
for all the world to see.

364
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,226
Not something I would do.

365
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:18,897
But Arthur has tools that I don't.

366
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:27,322
Hey! Glad to see you made it.

367
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:28,448
Kyle Butler.

368
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:31,618
- You remember my name.
- Oh, I'm like an elephant.

369
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:33,661
I never forget.

370
00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:36,539
- You didn't have any tools to bring?
- Lost 'em in the move.

371
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,459
Well, here. Take my hammer.

372
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,630
Hey, take good care of her, though.

373
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:45,507
We've been through a lot together.

374
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:47,133
So I saw.

375
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:51,096
- Very kind of you, Arthur.
- Well, generosity of spirit, Kyle.

376
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:52,514
It's the reason we're all here.

377
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,890
Not all of us.

378
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:56,309
Come on. I'll get you set up.

379
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,852
OK.

380
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:01,856
Grant 24-ounce steel framing hammer,
model number 514.

381
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,399
LaGuerta will be pleased.

382
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:06,361
Just bang in these three.
They're already marked.

383
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:08,154
Uh-huh.

384
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:13,743
But I have more important questions.

385
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,870
So, Arthur, you and your family
been doing this a long time?

386
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:16,996
For years.

387
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:20,166
I took Sally on a build
for our very first date.

388
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:25,171
And the kids have been coming
ever since they could hold a hammer.

389
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:31,553
You all seem really close. Happy.

390
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,972
Yeah. We are.

391
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,975
Envious.

392
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:01,124
You're Arthur's son, right? I'm Kyle.

393
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,293
Oh. Jonah. Nice to meet you.

394
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:06,254
Seems polite. Well adjusted.

395
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:09,424
- How's it going?
- It's hot. Ha!

396
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:10,592
It's nice that you're here, though.

397
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:12,760
There's got to be other ways
you'd rather spend your afternoon.

398
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:14,262
Well, no, it's OK.

399
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:16,598
You know, Mom and Dad
are big on the family time.

400
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:18,433
Yeah, that's nice.

401
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:21,769
For too many kids,
family time means fighting time.

402
00:25:21,896 --> 00:25:24,606
- Not mine.
- Never?

403
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:28,234
Not much to fight about, really.
My parents are cool.

404
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:31,321
Yeah, your dad seems
like a special guy.

405
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:34,699
He is. I-I really lucked out. Ha!

406
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:37,285
- How so?
- A lot of ways.

407
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:39,454
Like, you see that?

408
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,122
It's been my dad's baby for years.

409
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:43,249
A few days ago,
he hands me the keys.

410
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,501
Generosity of spirit.

411
00:25:45,628 --> 00:25:47,795
Foundation of love, man.

412
00:25:47,922 --> 00:25:49,255
Best dad ever.

413
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,674
Father of the frickin' year.

414
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,720
Oh, I got to get back to work.

415
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:58,306
Dad's not a big fan of idle hands.

416
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,069
Hey, Nikki.

417
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:15,156
You remember me?

418
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:17,617
Yeah. That cop.

419
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:19,369
Detective.

420
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:23,957
- The one you shot.
- Jesus Christ.

421
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,708
Here we go again.

422
00:26:27,628 --> 00:26:29,671
I told your boss
everything already.

423
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:31,881
Well, now you're gonna tell me.

424
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:35,843
Only this time
you're gonna tell the truth.

425
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:38,596
I told you. I've been telling
the truth the whole time.

426
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:41,349
Well, then come here
and tell it to my face.

427
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:43,810
This is so fucking stupid.

428
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:51,317
A bit closer
so I can see your eyes.

429
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:02,829
The night that you got shot,

430
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:04,872
I was in a hotel room with Johnny.

431
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:06,249
Bullshit.

432
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:08,668
We did meth,

433
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:10,378
we watched porn, we fucked.

434
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:12,380
I mean, we were watching
cartoons all night.

435
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:15,049
- What do you want? What do you want?
- You fucking liar.

436
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:18,928
No matter how many times you ask me,
it's not going to change.

437
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,389
I didn't shoot you, OK?

438
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:23,474
I didn't kill that old man.

439
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,685
Ow! Fuck!
Jesus Christ!

440
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,734
I'm gonna say I saw you.

441
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,737
People get mugged every day.

442
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:38,406
Maybe... Maybe somebody else
wanted you dead, huh?

443
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:39,824
Like who? Like who?

444
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:43,494
Oh, fuck. You're a fucking cop
for Christ's sakes.

445
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,538
You piss people off for a living.

446
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:46,789
Fuck you.

447
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:50,043
Fuck you! Fucking hurting me!

448
00:27:51,754 --> 00:27:54,047
You think that hurts?

449
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:56,549
Try watching the man you love
die right in front of you

450
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,885
with nothing you can do.

451
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:03,765
Oh, right.

452
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,643
You shot your own boyfriend.

453
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:12,065
You nasty piece of shit.

454
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:17,612
I killed Johnny. I know. I killed...

455
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:22,658
I do miss Johnny. I know.

456
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:27,288
If you... If you say

457
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:29,624
that you saw me kill Frank Lundy,

458
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,919
then you're the liar.
You are the liar!

459
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:43,846
I'd like to be transferred out of Homicide.

460
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,265
Always looking for the next best thing,
eh, Lieutenant?

461
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:48,976
- Aren't we all?
- Mm.

462
00:28:49,103 --> 00:28:50,770
I could use a change of scenery.

463
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:54,023
I'm thinking press liaison.

464
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:57,110
Well, PR could certainly use
your political skills.

465
00:28:57,236 --> 00:29:00,113
And Sergeant Batista
could stay in Homicide.

466
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,783
Well, let me think about it.

467
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:06,077
We both know
you're not easily replaced.

468
00:29:08,122 --> 00:29:10,248
That didn't seem to be
a problem before.

469
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:13,626
I'll let you know what I decide.

470
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,299
Hello.

471
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:22,718
Tell me that's the last of it.
The last bag from your apartment.

472
00:29:22,845 --> 00:29:25,638
It's not from my apartment.
But, Rita, wait, wait.

473
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,682
Surprise for you, for all of you.

474
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:30,977
No way! A Nintendo DS?

475
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:33,646
- I know it's not an iPod, but...
- A mini DVD player?

476
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,982
This is awesome.

477
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,986
For Harrison.

478
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:48,327
And for my lovely wife.

479
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:52,331
A bread maker?

480
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:54,041
We're always running out of bread.

481
00:29:54,168 --> 00:29:56,043
We're always running out of milk.

482
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,670
Did you get me a cow too?

483
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:01,507
- Thank you so much!
- This is so awesome. Thank you, Dexter.

484
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,426
You're welcome.

485
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:16,856
- What's the matter? You don't like your gift?
- I appreciate you trying.

486
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,733
I really do.

487
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:21,194
But we don't need gifts.

488
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,237
We need you.

489
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:29,869
Need me to do what?

490
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:34,707
Just talk to me.

491
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:41,297
I'm, uh...

492
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:43,549
People just do this?

493
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,801
Say what they're thinking?

494
00:30:45,928 --> 00:30:48,095
Out loud?

495
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:55,394
- How hard can it be?
- I'm trying. I'm trying.

496
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:59,232
You know what?

497
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,943
You can try harder in therapy.

498
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:04,403
I'm moving up our next session.

499
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:15,414
Wow. What's the occasion?

500
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:17,166
I have good news.

501
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,793
You want to guess?

502
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:21,295
Um, you're naked under there,

503
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:24,131
and I get to see?

504
00:31:24,258 --> 00:31:26,634
Guess what else you get to do?

505
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,929
OK, now I'm really having
impure thoughts.

506
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:32,098
You get to stay in Homicide.

507
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,770
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

508
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,398
- Wow. How did you...
- I had a little talk with the deputy chief,

509
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:43,776
and I told him Homicide
couldn't afford to lose you.

510
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,528
And neither could I.

511
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:48,948
You...

512
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:50,700
are...

513
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:52,827
- amazing.
- Mm-hm.

514
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,456
So he's OK with both of us staying?

515
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:02,295
Well, we can talk about
logistics later.

516
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:03,546
Right?

517
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:10,511
You told him you'd leave instead.

518
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:12,346
Angel.

519
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,432
It just makes more sense.

520
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:16,517
You're full of it.

521
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:19,061
You're sweet, and you're beautiful,

522
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,814
but you're full of it,
and I can't let you do that.

523
00:32:23,317 --> 00:32:27,320
Well, I'm not gonna
let you leave Homicide.

524
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:29,864
You love it.

525
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,866
And if you leave, you won't be you.

526
00:32:31,992 --> 00:32:33,909
At least not the you
that I want to be with.

527
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:36,829
What do we do?

528
00:32:41,335 --> 00:32:43,210
I don't know.

529
00:32:49,843 --> 00:32:52,845
How are we supposed to decide
what's more important?

530
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:56,015
Our jobs or each other?

531
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,399
Shit.

532
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:09,278
Shit is right.

533
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:17,161
This is Arthur Mitchell

534
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:18,704
at his core.

535
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:22,083
Is there something in his DNA
that lets him keep a family?

536
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:24,794
Some magic gene I'm missing?

537
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:28,756
Looking for something?

538
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:31,676
- You're surfing on my turf, blood guy.
- I'm just curious.

539
00:33:31,802 --> 00:33:35,471
Then you'll be interested to know
that the mitochondrial DNA...

540
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,349
female.

541
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:41,102
So mother, daughter, sister...

542
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:43,771
Ah, could even be his granny
he smudged on that wall.

543
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:46,607
Probably whacks off
with her ashes.

544
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,734
Why would he do that?

545
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:50,861
Why wouldn't he?

546
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:52,780
Because she's important to him.

547
00:33:52,906 --> 00:33:54,699
Dude. Joke.

548
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:57,993
His history with her shapes who he is.

549
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,538
Like how my mother
breast-fed me till I was six

550
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:02,665
and now no one will ever match up.

551
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:08,879
Lieutenant.

552
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:13,092
It's a Grant 24-ounce
steel framing hammer.

553
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:14,635
Sorry?

554
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:16,637
It's the murder weapon
in the bludgeoning case.

555
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,639
I did some independent research.

556
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,307
Updated my report.

557
00:34:20,434 --> 00:34:22,143
Right. Right. Thanks.

558
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:24,854
Actually, I'm done
with my work for the day.

559
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,982
If it's OK with you, I have some
personal stuff to take care of.

560
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:31,610
Oh. Take care of the personal stuff, Dexter.

561
00:34:32,446 --> 00:34:35,781
Take very good care.

562
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:40,286
Sure as hell trying to.

563
00:34:49,463 --> 00:34:51,672
You know those things never go bad.

564
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:54,175
Oh. Yeah, tell me about it.

565
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:56,552
I've had these
since I was a rookie.

566
00:34:57,596 --> 00:35:01,432
So I never heard back from you
about being an eyewitness.

567
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:03,893
That mean you changed your mind?

568
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:05,519
Yeah.

569
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:09,440
Just 'cause Nikki's a piece of shit
and my dad was a lying sack

570
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:11,025
doesn't mean I have to be.

571
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:15,362
Thanks for talking some sense into me.

572
00:35:15,489 --> 00:35:18,324
Just looking out for my partner.

573
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:19,492
What's all this?

574
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:24,246
I'm thinking maybe Nikki Wald
was telling the truth.

575
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,957
Since when?

576
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,667
Since I talked to her myself.

577
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:30,753
Wait, you what?

578
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:34,965
I've been going over everything you collected
from Lundy's hotel and...

579
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:37,092
all his personal effects.

580
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:41,180
Here's the thing - some of it's missing.

581
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:44,016
No way. It was all logged in. By me.

582
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:47,186
Lundy had research books
on that serial killer he was hunting.

583
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:49,021
And audio tapes.

584
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,731
I saw them in his room.

585
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:53,234
You still wrapped up in that, Deb?

586
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,402
I don't mean to speak ill,

587
00:35:55,529 --> 00:35:57,613
but the guy was chasing a ghost.

588
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:02,159
I think that ghost stole his books.

589
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:06,247
You got to stop.
You're making yourself crazy.

590
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:09,083
I'm telling you,
someone took Lundy's stuff.

591
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:12,711
And I'm telling you,
you got to let this go.

592
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:15,130
Look, I'm sure you're tired.
Why don't you go home...

593
00:36:15,257 --> 00:36:16,799
And what?

594
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:19,718
Paint my fucking nails?

595
00:36:23,056 --> 00:36:25,182
I'm kind of sick of hearing it, Quinn.

596
00:36:26,393 --> 00:36:28,727
Then I guess I won't say it anymore.

597
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:38,487
I am no longer seeing
Lieutenant LaGuerta.

598
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:43,242
I mean, I see her every day, but...

599
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:44,994
We broke up.

600
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:48,372
- Officially.
- And permanently.

601
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:51,333
Are you sure?

602
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:54,295
Because, frankly, I'm getting
a little sick of the back and forth.

603
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:56,755
I apologize for the inconvenience.

604
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:58,924
Well, it's middle-school bullshit,
Lieutenant.

605
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,218
I really don't want
to have this conversation again.

606
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:04,471
You won't have to. We've both signed
affidavits to make it official.

607
00:37:04,598 --> 00:37:07,766
Our relationship didn't interfere
with any ongoing investigations,

608
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:10,978
and the department will not be
held liable for any fallout.

609
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:12,938
Well, that's something at least.

610
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:15,649
For the record, neither one of us
was sexually harassed.

611
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:18,944
Yeah, all advances
were very welcomed.

612
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:22,489
And there was not nor will there be
a hostile work environment.

613
00:37:22,616 --> 00:37:24,992
So it's done.

614
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:27,036
We're both staying in Homicide.

615
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:31,957
Let me be clear.

616
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,293
The paperwork you're filing is serious.

617
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:40,007
If I find out this is bullshit,
there will be consequences.

618
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:44,386
Severe, career-ending
consequences.

619
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,309
Don't, Angel.

620
00:37:51,645 --> 00:37:52,937
It's over.

621
00:37:53,063 --> 00:37:55,397
Right. Sorry.

622
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:10,746
I should get back to work.

623
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:21,298
This is the last of it.
My dark passenger's... stuff

624
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:24,343
and the reason I can't let go
of my apartment.

625
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:26,595
If I don't figure out how to hide this,

626
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,390
I'm gonna lose my family.

627
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,101
Trinity has the answer.

628
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:36,188
He's kept his family close.
Even after death.

629
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:49,952
Who did you lose, Arthur?

630
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:12,307
1959. Sixteen.

631
00:39:12,434 --> 00:39:14,143
Vera Mitchell.

632
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:16,395
Sister of Arthur Mitchell.

633
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,439
Found dead in a...

634
00:39:18,565 --> 00:39:20,566
Bathtub.

635
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,113
Marsha Mitchell.

636
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:29,908
1961. Forty.

637
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:33,245
Jumped to her death
off the Collins Canal bridge.

638
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:38,459
Henry Mitchell.

639
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:41,462
1964. Forty-five.

640
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:44,590
Died in an alley
of a fatal head wound.

641
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:56,477
Sister, mother, father.

642
00:39:56,603 --> 00:39:59,688
He's recreating their deaths.
Decade after decade.

643
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:01,940
Cycles of three.

644
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:09,406
I watched my mother
get sawed into pieces.

645
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,533
Now I cut people up.

646
00:40:14,788 --> 00:40:16,371
We both have skeletons,

647
00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:19,500
which means we both get a closet
to keep them in.

648
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:26,298
Arthur has a closet.

649
00:40:27,509 --> 00:40:30,177
I know almost everything
about you, Arthur,

650
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:32,012
except where you hide.

651
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:34,515
Ready or not, here I come.

652
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:22,396
Oh, my goodness.
Kyle, you all right?

653
00:41:22,522 --> 00:41:24,356
Yeah, I cut myself at the build.

654
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,525
I didn't think it was a big deal,
but it won't stop bleeding.

655
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:29,069
Here.

656
00:41:31,865 --> 00:41:35,200
Right out in the open.
There must be more he's hiding inside.

657
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:39,454
Come on in.
We got a first-aid kit in the house.

658
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:44,126
Sorry.

659
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:47,546
No boots in the house.

660
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:50,299
Here, I'll get the kit.
You make yourself at home.

661
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:52,718
Thanks. I will.

662
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:04,479
Tacky, but normal.

663
00:42:04,606 --> 00:42:07,482
His secrets must be
under lock and key.

664
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:19,244
Not the dirty laundry I'm looking for.

665
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:28,378
Shit.

666
00:42:29,756 --> 00:42:32,507
Arthur has a place to put his lamp.

667
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:43,810
The dates and locations
from Lundy's books.

668
00:42:43,937 --> 00:42:46,813
Arthur's been using Four Walls builds
around the country

669
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,941
as a cover to kill.

670
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:52,152
And these are his trophies.

671
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:57,157
Hanging right up here on the wall
just like his hammer in the garage.

672
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:00,786
His blood slides.

673
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:03,997
He doesn't need a secret apartment.
He's hiding in plain sight,

674
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:06,917
right in the center of his family.

675
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:10,045
I'm the one who's lurking
in the shadows.

676
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:16,635
And here she is,
Arthur's own dark passenger -

677
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:20,305
his sister Vera.

678
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:26,436
The tank is low, but then,
she's been on the road for 30 years.

679
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:27,562
Kyle!

680
00:43:27,689 --> 00:43:29,314
Hiding in plain sight is one thing,

681
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,983
but this is your weak spot.

682
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:33,777
What happens
when it's exposed?

683
00:43:35,238 --> 00:43:37,447
Come out, come out, whoever you are.

684
00:43:40,493 --> 00:43:41,910
OK.

685
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:44,246
Let's have a look at that hand.

686
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:05,851
Don't... touch...

687
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:08,645
my sister.

688
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:11,356
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

689
00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:14,109
I can't breathe.

690
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:22,534
I'm... I'm sorry.

691
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:27,247
Forgive me. I'm so sorry.

692
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:29,249
Jesus, Arthur,
what the hell was that?

693
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,043
It's just...

694
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:34,463
My sister...

695
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:39,176
She died when I was young.

696
00:44:41,346 --> 00:44:43,055
It was very painful for me.

697
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:47,559
I understand.

698
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:51,396
I've lost people too.

699
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,233
Yeah. Have a seat.

700
00:45:07,497 --> 00:45:12,709
If the ashes bother you so much,
why do you keep them out?

701
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:16,463
Because she's a part of me, Kyle.

702
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:18,423
Helped make me who I am.

703
00:45:23,888 --> 00:45:26,973
But if your family
ever saw you so upset...

704
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:29,518
They'd understand.

705
00:45:29,644 --> 00:45:31,520
This is my home.

706
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:33,063
I can be myself here.

707
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:39,611
You make it sound easy.

708
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:43,156
I used to push people away

709
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:45,325
because of my past.

710
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:48,120
Even lost a relationship over it.

711
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,497
Like you.

712
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:55,877
- But you changed.
- Yeah, I met Sally,

713
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,879
had my kids,

714
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:00,507
and I realized...

715
00:46:00,633 --> 00:46:04,553
the only way it was gonna work
is if I jumped in with both feet.

716
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:11,184
Jump in with both feet, huh?

717
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:16,273
And that saved your family?

718
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:20,569
Kyle...

719
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:24,614
my family saved me.

720
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:35,250
Wait.

721
00:46:35,376 --> 00:46:36,918
I want to give you something.

722
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:48,889
For the next build.

723
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,684
I thought you should have
your own tools.

724
00:46:54,854 --> 00:46:56,563
It's the least I can do.

725
00:46:56,689 --> 00:46:57,606
Thanks.

726
00:46:57,732 --> 00:46:59,858
For giving me
your murder weapon.

727
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,861
See you at the next build, then.

728
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:05,197
Wouldn't miss it.

729
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:07,657
I want to be a part of this family.

730
00:47:10,453 --> 00:47:12,454
And I know I need
to jump in with both feet.

731
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:13,830
I'm glad, but...

732
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:15,957
I want to let you in.

733
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:22,422
Honestly, I don't know...

734
00:47:25,218 --> 00:47:26,718
how.

735
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:32,807
I never learned.

736
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:37,562
No, of course you didn't.

737
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:40,815
God, I...

738
00:47:40,942 --> 00:47:42,442
I mean, with your mother and...

739
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:44,277
What about his mother?

740
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:46,488
She was murdered
right in front of him.

741
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:48,323
Wow, that's...

742
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:50,742
that's quite a history.

743
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:56,748
And it shaped who I am.

744
00:47:58,084 --> 00:48:00,752
But I want to change.

745
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:06,258
Let me ask you a question,
Dexter. And I'd like you to be honest.

746
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,593
I'll try.

747
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:12,430
Would you say that you're afraid
to let Rita get close to you?

748
00:48:14,642 --> 00:48:16,643
- Yes.
- Why?

749
00:48:19,939 --> 00:48:21,982
Because of my past.

750
00:48:22,108 --> 00:48:24,317
Are you afraid she'll abandon you?

751
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:26,319
Yes.

752
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:28,113
But Rita is not your mother.

753
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:33,076
No, definitely not, but if she...

754
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:37,622
ever sees me
for who I really am...

755
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:40,542
Then what?

756
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:42,836
You think I would leave?

757
00:48:42,962 --> 00:48:45,005
Yes, absolutely.

758
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:46,506
Oh.

759
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:49,801
Well, then you've got something
to learn about me.

760
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:53,930
I married you because
I want to get to know the real you.

761
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:57,183
That's what I've been trying to tell you.

762
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,477
Dexter.

763
00:49:00,313 --> 00:49:02,188
Tell Rita the truth.

764
00:49:02,315 --> 00:49:04,316
Why did you keep
your apartment?

765
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,657
Because...

766
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,162
I need space...

767
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:21,916
to keep...

768
00:49:22,043 --> 00:49:23,835
my stuff.

769
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:27,714
We have a house.
There's plenty of room.

770
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,216
I think what Dexter is trying to say

771
00:49:30,343 --> 00:49:33,345
is that he needs space for himself
in the marriage.

772
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:37,474
OK, yeah, but I really do need a place

773
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,185
- to put my stuff.
- Of course.

774
00:49:40,728 --> 00:49:43,980
Of course.
I'll... I'll give you space.

775
00:49:45,441 --> 00:49:47,525
You will?

776
00:49:47,652 --> 00:49:49,027
Yes.

777
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:53,615
See what happens
when you're honest?

778
00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:55,867
You get what you need.

779
00:50:18,307 --> 00:50:20,058
I know you're here.

780
00:50:26,691 --> 00:50:28,358
You always catch me.

781
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:39,911
Mind if I join you?

782
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:08,982
Look how beautiful you are.

783
00:51:09,108 --> 00:51:10,650
Mm.

784
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:13,778
I'll never get tired of hearing that.

785
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:40,930
You look better.

786
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:43,016
I feel better.

787
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:46,019
You know why?

788
00:51:46,145 --> 00:51:47,771
Nikki Wald didn't kill Lundy.

789
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:50,857
How do you know?

790
00:51:50,983 --> 00:51:52,901
'Cause somebody stole
Lundy's Trinity research.

791
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:53,943
Me.

792
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:55,987
And there's only one person
who'd have a reason to do that.

793
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:57,363
Me?

794
00:51:57,490 --> 00:52:00,366
- Trinity.
- You're kidding.

795
00:52:00,493 --> 00:52:03,703
He must have realized
Lundy was getting close.

796
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:06,039
Think about it.
That newspaper article.

797
00:52:06,165 --> 00:52:08,750
Maybe he even saw Lundy
staking out that office building.

798
00:52:10,002 --> 00:52:12,837
- I guess.
- He killed Lundy, he shot me,

799
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:15,215
he stole Lundy's books
to cover his ass.

800
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:18,259
Not exactly, but you were
on a roll there for a while.

801
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:20,011
Do you know how awesome this is?

802
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:22,055
It means that cocksucker
is still out there,

803
00:52:22,181 --> 00:52:24,390
and I don't have to sit around and wait
for someone else to take care of it.

804
00:52:24,517 --> 00:52:26,100
I can get him.

805
00:52:26,227 --> 00:52:29,395
Great, now I've got to worry
about you getting on Trinity's radar.

806
00:52:29,522 --> 00:52:32,232
- Have you told LaGuerta your theory?
- Not yet.

807
00:52:32,358 --> 00:52:35,527
I need to make sure I have a case first.
I don't want to step on my dick.

808
00:52:35,653 --> 00:52:38,071
No, definitely not.

809
00:52:38,197 --> 00:52:41,282
I got to get to the station.
Lots of work to do.

810
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:43,535
By the way...

811
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:45,453
I think I know who dad was fucking.

812
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:49,249
What? Wait, who?

813
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:51,042
I'll tell you when I know more.

814
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:53,837
I don't want to step on my dick
with that either.

815
00:53:02,388 --> 00:53:04,389
So you ready?

816
00:53:10,396 --> 00:53:12,772
I was born of primordial ooze.

817
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:15,400
I crawled out
of my own mother's blood.

818
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:20,530
I hid among the humans,
hoping not to be seen.

819
00:53:20,656 --> 00:53:23,116
But somewhere along the way,
I grew legs,

820
00:53:23,242 --> 00:53:24,993
stood upright.

821
00:53:28,414 --> 00:53:31,583
- Would you give me a hand?
- Absolutely.

822
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,594
So what do you think? Is it too stuffy?

823
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:45,763
Nope.

824
00:53:53,898 --> 00:53:55,815
It's perfect.

825
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:57,233
Thank you.

826
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:59,903
I became a husband, a father.

827
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:04,073
I had to evolve.
It was the only way to survive.

828
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:07,201
Wait. I have something else
I want to give you.

829
00:54:08,621 --> 00:54:11,748
Being myself in front of my family
will take some getting used to,

830
00:54:11,874 --> 00:54:13,625
but Arthur was right.

831
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:16,753
It does feel... good.

832
00:54:20,132 --> 00:54:21,883
Got it.

833
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:23,843
A padlock?

834
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:26,095
For the door. To keep it locked.

835
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:29,098
Shouldn't I leave it open?

836
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:31,309
Please, we have three young children.

837
00:54:32,561 --> 00:54:34,312
There's dangerous stuff in there.
