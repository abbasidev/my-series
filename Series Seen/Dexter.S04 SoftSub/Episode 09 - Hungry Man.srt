1
00:00:02,044 --> 00:00:03,378
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:06,589
Judging from the spray, we're looking
at somebody tall. Over six feet.

3
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:09,258
He moved the arm.
For a reason.

4
00:00:09,385 --> 00:00:13,304
The killer leaves the ash as his signature,
making his vics point at it.

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,556
Lundy came to Miami to hunt this guy.

6
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:19,477
I think he got too close
and I think it got him killed and me shot.

7
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:23,272
It's been my dad's baby for years.
A few days ago, he hands me the keys.

8
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:27,110
No, no. Smooth circular motions, son.

9
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:29,445
- I got it, Dad.
- If you got it, I wouldn't have to remind you.

10
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,739
Small cracks in the perfect family.

11
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,991
I can lose my job.
Not like I'm the only one.

12
00:00:34,118 --> 00:00:37,203
Being a journalist these days is like
a straight ticket to the unemployment line.

13
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:39,455
Either I get a lead that bleeds

14
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:42,417
or basically... I'm done.

15
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:44,585
Are the sweeps connected
to the shootings of Agent Lundy?

16
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:47,004
I know it's really tough for reporters
right now.

17
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:48,631
So maybe instead of this one,

18
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:51,509
I can give you that interview
you've been wanting from me.

19
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:55,221
Mother shit fuck.
How tall was my shooter?

20
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,307
My height.

21
00:00:58,434 --> 00:01:00,143
- Then it wasn't Trinity?
- Nope.

22
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:02,854
I was a "dress over the head" party girl.

23
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,398
- You must think I'm...
- Totally charming.

24
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,192
We broke up. Officially.

25
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:13,614
If I find out this is bullshit, there will
be severe, career-ending consequences.

26
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,491
Fuck it.

27
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,952
No more confessions,
no more good deeds,

28
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,288
and no more fucking remorse.

29
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,291
No, you're mine.

30
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:30,423
Arthur Mitchell, you just got a reprieve.

31
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:35,756
This'll do the job.

32
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:41,053
Cut you into exactly the right size pieces.

33
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,265
You got one more day.

34
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,321
Happy families are all alike.

35
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:01,490
They never leave you by yourself
on holidays.

36
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:06,537
I got some interesting Thanksgiving
greetings from your Coach Davis.

37
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,749
If you're not gonna play baseball anymore,
I suppose you aren't gonna need this.

38
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,667
- No, D-Dad...
- All right?

39
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:16,047
How about this?
Oh, you're full of awards.

40
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:19,467
Once the turkey's gone...
so is Arthur.

41
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,135
How about this one?

42
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,262
This one's for Most Valuable Player.

43
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:37,026
Fuck you, Dad.

44
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:41,906
Family business.

45
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,658
It's my business too.

46
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,927
OK. Healthy way to blow off steam.

47
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,140
What the hell?

48
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,893
Jonah? Hey, it's just me.

49
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:15,690
- Mr. Butler, what are you doing here?
- I stopped by your house.

50
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,900
I saw you arguing with your father.

51
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,402
No, I don't argue.

52
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:22,530
- I never argue.
- Still, it looked like a bad one.

53
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:26,492
Man, you have no idea what he's like.

54
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,744
How he treats my mother and Rebecca.

55
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:31,539
You don't know what he's capable of.

56
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,625
- Well, actually...
- He hits me.

57
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:36,752
That's not right.

58
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:42,883
You know, I'm running out of clichés
to tell the coaches.

59
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:47,096
You know, "Hey, I fell down some stairs.
I walked into a door."

60
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,602
I know it looks like we have
the perfect fucking family,

61
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:55,479
but in that house...

62
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:59,275
when he's there,
it's not a life; it's a tour of duty.

63
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:04,989
Shit. I...

64
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:09,452
- He'd kill me if he knew I was telling you.
- I won't say a word.

65
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:16,333
You should have just let him die.

66
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,259
- Where you going?
- Anywhere away from here.

67
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,678
I can't go back.

68
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,764
Not to him.
Not with the car like this.

69
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,683
So I'll go with you.
I'll be there when you tell him.

70
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:37,605
- Why?
- You're not the only one with father issues.

71
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,193
Well, you know, maybe...

72
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:47,656
I mean, I guess if you came
to Thanksgiving tomorrow,

73
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:49,742
- Dad would be on his best.
- Thanksgiving?

74
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:53,579
Dinner's at one.
I can stay at Luke's house until then.

75
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:57,124
Guess I'm having two turkey dinners
this year.

76
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:06,509
The DNA sweep didn't
give them Trinity.

77
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:09,178
But it did bring in
a cornucopia of criminals.

78
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:13,307
That should keep Miami Metro
off the Trinity case through the holiday.

79
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,851
Deb won't be anywhere near as easy.

80
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:19,396
Sorry, Dex, but I'm spending Thanksgiving
with 90 or so of my newest friends.

81
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:22,608
Look at these victims.
It looks like a family portrait.

82
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:27,238
The bathtub women, they're always
young and single. A first girlfriend maybe.

83
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:31,200
The jumper's always a mother of two.
Maybe that represents his mom or his wife.

84
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:34,161
But I don't think this guy's married.
The bludgeonee's always a father...

85
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,872
You used to love Thanksgiving
when we were kids.

86
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:39,458
You wore the little Indian headdresses.

87
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,752
Picked the pearl onions
out of the green beans.

88
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,337
Yeah.

89
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,172
Mom's green beans.

90
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,049
And then she died.

91
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,343
And it was you and me
and Dad and football

92
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,929
and TV dinners in aluminum trays.

93
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:55,516
- Talk about your lonely.
- Well, you won't be lonely at our house.

94
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,476
You'll never get the chance.

95
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,186
Dexter...

96
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,064
I am lead detective
on the biggest case of my career.

97
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,234
- This is where I belong.
- I thought Batista was lead.

98
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,237
He's the lead on Lundy now.
Once we figured out Trinity didn't shoot me,

99
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:10,656
- there was no conflict for me...
- What? Wait.

100
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,950
Trinity didn't shoot you?

101
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,869
While you were at
your Rain Man convention,

102
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:18,289
Masuka and I put it together
form the bullet's trajectory.

103
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,710
- How did I not see that?
- We were too close.

104
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,920
That's what happens
when you make it personal.

105
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,506
So I've heard.

106
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,717
So... who shot you?

107
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:34,805
Maybe Trinity knows.
I'll ask him when I haul his ass in here.

108
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:39,435
Deb, you really, really need
to come to Thanksgiving.

109
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,897
Tell the family I said "hi".

110
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:46,525
Heads up, everybody.
This DNA sweep has been like Christmas.

111
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:50,070
We got hits on three open rape cases
and one open burglary case,

112
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,948
but best of all,
hits on two homicides.

113
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:55,951
Merry Thanksgiving, Soderquist.

114
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,245
This one is mine.
Keep up the good work, guys.

115
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:03,626
- Sarge... any news on any other cases?
- We'll find the fucker who shot you.

116
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:07,087
You know that.
Focus on what you can control.

117
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,591
- Catching Trinity.
- Catching Trinity.

118
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:21,310
I heard the ACLU's
filing suit on the sweeps.

119
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:25,814
We've got maybe 72 hours
till we're shut down for good.

120
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:28,984
- We'll just have to keep pushing harder.
- The holidays may slow us down.

121
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,654
- We'll have a skeleton crew.
- I'll be here.

122
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:35,282
Never been much
for family holidays anyway.

123
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,369
Particularly when they're all still in Cuba.

124
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,455
Particularly.

125
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,292
Are you with Auri tomorrow?

126
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,336
- She's with her moms this year.
- Hmm.

127
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:50,381
Plus I have a chance to close
an old case of mine, so...

128
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:55,094
So I guess we'll both
be working Thanksgiving.

129
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:57,304
Together.

130
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,015
How unfortunate.

131
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:09,775
- Put it up higher, Mom.
- No, I want it lower.

132
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,569
Are happy families all alike?

133
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:14,321
Much better.

134
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,658
- Dexter's home!
- Oh, good. They didn't run out of pies.

135
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,994
Here you go.

136
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:23,664
OK, bird, confess.

137
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:27,459
- How big are you?
- 22 pounds.

138
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,422
- That's a lot of bird.
- Better too much than not enough.

139
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:34,341
I mean, that's what the holiday's about.
That and family.

140
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,221
- About tomorrow...
- Uh-oh.

141
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:42,474
It's not a big deal,
but the Monroe County PD

142
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,561
needs a spatter interpretation on a bar fight

143
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:47,521
and their blood guy's in the Bahamas.

144
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,567
Should just take a few hours.

145
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:54,903
- Does it have to be tomorrow?
- That's when the reconstruction is.

146
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:58,240
- Mm.
- Plus I'll be making triple overtime.

147
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:01,618
Sure, that's a plus...
but you'll be missing all the fun.

148
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:03,120
Yeah.

149
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:06,081
Poor you. Poor us.

150
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:09,793
- At least Elliot will be here.
- Yeah, good old Elliot.

151
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,920
So is Deb coming?

152
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:14,173
She's on the fence.

153
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:18,344
No, tell her that this is
our first family Thanksgiving

154
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,929
and that we're establishing traditions
that will shape our kids

155
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:23,515
and that they'll pass on to their kids
and that she's a part of that.

156
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,726
An important part of that.

157
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,272
Rather than me tell her all that...

158
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:34,234
OK, guys, now look real sad,
I mean, really miserable.

159
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:37,654
And... action.

160
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:41,658
Hi, Aunt Deb. We just heard that you
might not come to Thanksgiving dinner,

161
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:44,078
- and, well...
- We really want you to come.

162
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:47,748
- Look sad, retard.
- All right, all right. Just...

163
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,416
Take two.

164
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,960
Will you please come over?

165
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:53,921
Fuck me.

166
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:09,478
You're here late.

167
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:11,313
Ah, didn't even notice.

168
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:15,150
- Big plans tomorrow?
- You're looking at them.

169
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,819
Whatever about tomorrow, right?

170
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:19,571
It's just another day
where people eat turkey.

171
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,448
I can eat turkey any day of the year.

172
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:25,285
Dexter's having people over.

173
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,705
Well, me.
He invited me over.

174
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,583
Have a good time.

175
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,629
You know...

176
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,675
- I could use a wingman...
- Yes.

177
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:41,677
I can't promise it'll be any fun.

178
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:45,097
Well, I could be your thigh man.

179
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:47,724
Don't press your luck.

180
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:49,601
I'll let Rita know.

181
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:00,696
What time do you want
to eat tomorrow?

182
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:03,115
Oh, bad news, babe. I got to work.

183
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,534
Oh.

184
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,912
Well, what time do you get off?

185
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,205
Uh...

186
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:13,959
You do want to spend
the holiday together, don't you?

187
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:16,920
- It's a holiday.
- Exactly.

188
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:21,216
Spending it together makes things all...
serious.

189
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:25,846
Oh, it's just a casual Thanksgiving
with your girlfriend.

190
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,848
Girlfriend?

191
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:30,726
That sounds... really serious.

192
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:33,812
Joey...

193
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,815
I don't want to spend it alone.

194
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,155
Plus, uh...

195
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:47,701
I make the best pecan pie
in the state of Florida.

196
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:53,332
I guess I could, you know...
come by for dessert.

197
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:57,836
Oh, so you just want to eat my pie.
Is that it?

198
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:17,731
- Happy Thanksgiving, Mr. Mitchell.
- Happy Thanksgiving!

199
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,293
I'll be at Arthur's by one, home by four.

200
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:41,296
A serial killer's Thanksgiving recipe
for success.

201
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:44,758
- How can none of these be big enough?
- Well, maybe if we, um...

202
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,927
Turn the bird on its side...

203
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:49,346
Hey, Dex.

204
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:51,348
Howdy, pilgrim.

205
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:55,894
Did you hear that the pilgrims
didn't eat turkey on the first Thanksgiving?

206
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,438
- Really?
- They ate corn and eel,

207
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:01,775
which the Native Americans
taught them to plant and fish.

208
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,486
Then the pilgrims slaughtered them all,
took their food,

209
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:07,906
and went to church the next day
to thank God for all their good luck.

210
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:13,203
Mm, it's a phase.
Don't worry about it.

211
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:17,499
What you said about traditions
shaping our kids...

212
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:21,086
My not going to work, will that...
misshape them?

213
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:24,172
Look, I wish it was otherwise,
but you'll be home soon, right?

214
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:26,425
Right. I just...

215
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:30,304
I don't want to do any damage.

216
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:34,600
You're a parent.
Parents do damage.

217
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:38,228
Hopefully we'll do enough
of the good stuff to balance it out.

218
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,688
Hopefully.

219
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:42,816
Thanks.

220
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,947
- "Ashes to ashes..."
- Doughnut to doughnut.

221
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:53,201
- It's all the store had left.
- What are you doing here?

222
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:56,413
Avoiding Christine.
She can be a little intense.

223
00:15:57,248 --> 00:16:00,542
Tell me about it. She keeps calling
to set that interview with me.

224
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,754
- You said you'd do it.
- Little busy here.

225
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,465
Look at the timing of the Trinity kills.

226
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:10,135
15 in December,
40 in July and August...

227
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:14,348
20 or so in the spring.
What's the pattern?

228
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,643
Long-haul truck driver?

229
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:20,937
Migrant worker?
Some kind of salesman.

230
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:22,939
Yeah.

231
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:24,191
Gobble, gobble.

232
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:29,196
- She's nothing if not persistent.
- Hey, babe. What are you doing here?

233
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,115
I thought I'd bring Thanksgiving to you.

234
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,992
How sweet.

235
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:37,621
- There's enough for both of you.
- Oh, thanks, but I'm heading out.

236
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:41,750
- Debra's taking the day off.
- Fuck that. I'll be multitasking.

237
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:45,545
- Well, I guess you can take the day off too.
- Sure he can.

238
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:52,469
Yeah, let me just... check with the boss.
We'll go eat.

239
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:58,392
So, Debra... how are you feeling?

240
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:02,229
Do you mind if we put off that interview
until after the holiday?

241
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:07,234
I'm not here as a reporter;
I'm here as Joey's... girlfriend.

242
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:11,363
My condolences.

243
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:13,740
You know, he really cares about you.

244
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:17,369
After you got shot,
you were all he could talk about.

245
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:20,789
- Really messed him up.
- Well, that makes two of us.

246
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,459
I just... I just wanted to say...

247
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,712
Um...

248
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:28,964
I'm really sorry...

249
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,425
about what happened to you.

250
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:34,928
I can't even imagine...

251
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:38,682
looking into the eyes
of the person you love...

252
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:41,935
watching as he takes his last breath.

253
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,234
Let's hope you never have to.

254
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,581
You got Lloyd Paulson to confess?

255
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:05,208
Been waiting ten years to close this one.

256
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,420
I promised the victim's husband
I'd find the man who killed his wife.

257
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:10,005
Finally lived up to that promise.

258
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:13,717
You should go tell the husband.
Give him something to be thankful for.

259
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:17,262
As soon as I process that pendejo.
Do you want to come with?

260
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:20,599
To a next-of-kin notification?

261
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,851
It is official business.

262
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,945
- Kyle!
- Happy Thanksgiving.

263
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:35,989
To you too.

264
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,659
Kyle. What a nice surprise.

265
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:41,870
Apparently Jonah
didn't mention inviting me.

266
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:44,998
I just wanted to drop by and say hi.

267
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:50,128
It's my first Thanksgiving
without my family and I...

268
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,757
didn't know what to do with myself.

269
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,345
I suppose you should eat with us.

270
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,764
Full tables, full hearts.

271
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,350
Full bellies. Come on in.

272
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:11,233
- Aunt Deb's here!
- Happy Thanksgiving, turkeys.

273
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,610
Thanks for the video.

274
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,863
- Hi, Deb.
- Hi, Deb.

275
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,281
Hi.

276
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,201
- Who's that?
- Danny and Grace's dad.

277
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,078
Danny, let me help.

278
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:26,081
Ah. Where's Dexter?

279
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:29,251
He's at some crime thing
in Monroe County.

280
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:32,838
- Said he'd be back for dinner.
- He's more like Dad every day.

281
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:35,382
Come look at our puzzle.
We've already got the corners.

282
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,217
Cody, leave her alone.

283
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:40,762
- You don't want to help?
- Sorry, little man, but I've got work to do.

284
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,556
Oh.

285
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,104
You are good.

286
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,314
Another three hours to go.

287
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,817
When do you want to put in
the broccoli-cheese casserole?

288
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,151
About an hour before.

289
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:58,280
The sweet potatoes need an hour and
the corn pudding needs about 30 minutes.

290
00:19:58,406 --> 00:19:59,739
Is it all gonna fit?

291
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:03,952
No. None of it's gonna fit.

292
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:05,620
What was I thinking?

293
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:09,416
You were thinking, "My fabulous neighbor
has not one, but two ovens."

294
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:12,460
You know, you really are a lifesaver.

295
00:20:12,587 --> 00:20:14,921
You should just wear a red cross
on your forehead.

296
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:18,133
Oven crisis.

297
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:20,510
Deb, can you watch the kids?
Harrison's asleep.

298
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,637
Actually, I was gonna try to get some...

299
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,014
Oh!

300
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,807
...work done.

301
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,685
Vince, hi!
Vince, Elliot. Elliot, Vince.

302
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:30,520
Hi. Uh, bye.

303
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:33,106
- Uh... bye.
- Bye.

304
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:36,651
- They're using his oven.
- Oh.

305
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,195
Well... guess I'll be using his oven too.

306
00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:41,573
Chocolate lava cakes.
My specialty.

307
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:43,158
You have a specialty?

308
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:45,827
A river of chocolate love
that melts in your mouth.

309
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:48,830
Wow. You can make
anything sound perverted.

310
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,707
It's a gift.

311
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:02,052
Arthur seems to be in a decent mood.
Maybe I'll be able to slip out early.

312
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:04,638
It's almost one.
You want me to set the table?

313
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:07,015
No, we've got to watch the game first.

314
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:09,684
- The game?
- Yeah, it's tradition, Kyle.

315
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:13,229
Ah! Will the kids be joining us?

316
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:19,945
That too would be tradition,
but apparently Jonah has forgotten.

317
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:22,322
I'm sure he's on his way.

318
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,950
He knows how important
holidays are to you.

319
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:32,457
Not such a decent mood after all.

320
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:36,670
Do you think Rebecca could come out now?

321
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:39,756
I suppose.

322
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:41,633
I'll go get her.

323
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:48,056
- She grounded or something?
- Oh, no.

324
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:49,849
No, nothing like that.

325
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:02,862
This is Carl Haas?

326
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:06,700
He's been in a persistent vegetative state
for several years.

327
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:10,161
Stepped off a sidewalk,
got hit by a bus.

328
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,999
I didn't know.

329
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:17,127
It's been a long time.

330
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:19,963
Would it be possible
to have a moment alone with him?

331
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:22,549
Have a good Turkey Day.

332
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,974
Tell him.

333
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,143
Like he can hear me.

334
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:34,894
He'll hear you.

335
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:48,616
Mr. Haas...
I'm the one who told you about your wife.

336
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:53,663
I also promised that I'd fi...

337
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,082
This is pointless.

338
00:22:57,668 --> 00:23:03,298
Mr. Haas, Angel knows how much
your wife meant to you...

339
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:06,843
and he wants you to know...

340
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,269
I want you to know...

341
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,523
that we found the guy who killed her.

342
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,652
I wish...

343
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:26,780
I wish we would have found him sooner.

344
00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:30,950
Really, I wish he would have
never killed your wife,

345
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:32,952
but I can't change that.

346
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:39,501
Can't change anything.

347
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:41,252
But we got the guy.

348
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:43,421
We got him.

349
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:51,221
- Hello, Mr. Butler. How are you?
- Well, I'm fine, Rebecca.

350
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:53,681
Kyle, you up for
a little pre-game football toss?

351
00:23:53,808 --> 00:23:55,767
I suppose.

352
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:57,936
I'll go help Mom in the kitchen.

353
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:04,150
At least I have one perfect child.

354
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:06,903
Yeah, so it would appear.

355
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:09,405
Come on.

356
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:16,704
Normally, Jonah supplies the football.

357
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:20,542
- How about a baseball?
- No. We throw the baseball in spring.

358
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:24,170
Thanksgiving, we throw the football.
Traditions matter, Kyle.

359
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:27,882
Yes, they... shape people.

360
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:31,553
Yeah, and give children
a sense of history, tradition.

361
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,972
Teaches them who they are
and what's expected of them.

362
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:35,723
And what is expected of them?

363
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:39,352
Generosity, common sense, obedience.

364
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:42,188
It's a father's responsibility
to set the boundaries,

365
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,440
child's duty to honor them.

366
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:49,946
No, there's nothing down there.
Stop! Kyle, no!

367
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:56,286
I made that...

368
00:24:57,288 --> 00:24:59,289
when I was still confused.

369
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:05,044
Well, it's beautiful.

370
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,842
Which is why I haven't torn it apart.

371
00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:14,888
Probably donate it to the needy.

372
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:17,098
Obviously, I won't be needing it.

373
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,392
No, you'll be buried at sea.

374
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,811
I have a new lease on life.

375
00:25:22,897 --> 00:25:24,647
Thanks to you.

376
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:27,066
Hey.

377
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:30,904
Oh. The best laid plans...

378
00:25:31,906 --> 00:25:33,489
It's Jonah's.

379
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:38,953
What's the point of giving him the better
things in life if he can't take care of them?

380
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:49,881
What kind of father
keeps a coffin in his garage?

381
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,885
What kind of father
keeps blood slides in his shed?

382
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:03,019
Hey, we can still get some...

383
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:08,566
Here we go.

384
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:14,989
Dad, I don't know what happened. The car
was parked in Luke's driveway all night.

385
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:20,036
I came out this morning and, you know,
someone had just gone all mental on it.

386
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,331
Dad, I am so sorry.

387
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:27,752
That's why God
invented car insurance, right?

388
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:41,599
It'll be OK.

389
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,327
There!

390
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:05,290
Now it's drivable
till we can get her fixed.

391
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:07,667
Well...

392
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:11,671
Game's about to start.
Shall we?

393
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:19,220
Come on, Danny. Throw it here.

394
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:22,098
Come on, Danny. Throw it here.

395
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:25,184
- Oh, good one.
- Hey, you two. No wiffle ball in the house.

396
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:29,689
I don't know how you do it.
All these kids at home at the same time.

397
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:32,066
Thanksgiving's only four days.

398
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:34,694
You should try keeping them entertained
for three months in the summer.

399
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,071
Yeah, plus spring break
and Christmas break.

400
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:39,532
That's when you're really climbing the walls.

401
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,743
June, July, August...

402
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:45,246
December.

403
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:47,832
Oh...

404
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:49,584
fu-u-udge!

405
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:52,086
Trinity's in the school system.

406
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,088
Quinn.

407
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:57,258
Joey, it's Deb.
His kill schedule matches the school year.

408
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:58,718
Trinity could be a janitor.

409
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:02,930
He could be a cafeteria worker,
a bus driver, a teacher, a principal.

410
00:28:03,057 --> 00:28:05,600
- We got to get to the station.
- I haven't eaten yet.

411
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:07,602
Jesus, grab a drumstick to go.

412
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:09,354
Deb, no one's working today

413
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,065
and we're gonna need a warrant
to access any school databases.

414
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:13,608
We can find a judge.

415
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:16,277
Yeah, who's gonna love us
for tearing him away from his family.

416
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:18,071
Come on, we're not gonna
get anywhere today.

417
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:21,115
Fu...

418
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:23,701
Fudge.

419
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:28,081
- Break in a case?
- We'll see.

420
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:34,879
Not a horrible Thanksgiving, right?

421
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,590
No, actually it's kinda nice.

422
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:40,134
You sound surprised.

423
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,303
I am a little.

424
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:43,805
Hmm.

425
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:46,516
So having a girlfriend isn't so bad after all?

426
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,936
You with the labels.

427
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:51,562
Why does it matter?

428
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:54,107
I just...

429
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,652
I care about you.

430
00:28:57,778 --> 00:29:00,113
I'd kinda like to have it returned.

431
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,575
Come here.

432
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:11,457
I have a better idea.

433
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:15,586
Aw!

434
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:18,381
You are so my girlfriend.

435
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:26,139
Get... get... get him!
Get him!

436
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:27,849
Get... get... get... get him!

437
00:29:27,975 --> 00:29:28,975
Ah!

438
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:33,020
It's OK, they didn't get the first down.

439
00:29:33,147 --> 00:29:35,148
Jonah seems safe for the moment.

440
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:39,527
I'm not a big football fan.
I think I'll go see if I can help Sally.

441
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:42,905
Oh, that's very nice of you.

442
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:47,535
Look at that.
There's three men on him.

443
00:29:48,871 --> 00:29:50,663
Yeah, I know.

444
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,669
This room's kinda young for a teenager.

445
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:04,218
Are those to keep someone out...

446
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,345
or keep someone in?

447
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,525
My God.
He locks his daughter in here.

448
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:33,331
You need any help?

449
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:36,417
I'm completely useless in the kitchen.

450
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:38,753
Sure. Uh...

451
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:41,005
something for the centerpiece.

452
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:43,758
Roses.
Dad always likes these.

453
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:45,801
Everything for Dad, huh?

454
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:51,349
Those locks on your door for him too?

455
00:30:58,065 --> 00:31:01,859
- He says they're there to protect me.
- And do they?

456
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:10,243
He's open. He's open! Go, go!

457
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:12,828
Touchdown! What a play!

458
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:23,422
No, no. No, Dad.

459
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:29,178
Ow!

460
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:38,646
And that's for my windshield.

461
00:31:42,276 --> 00:31:44,777
Things of beauty need to be honored.

462
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:59,834
I ran away once.

463
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,627
He caught me and...

464
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:06,299
- it was bad.
- It's not always gonna be like this.

465
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:15,516
- Jonah told me that you're helping him.
- Yeah, if you can call it that.

466
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:19,812
You can help me too.
Get me out of here.

467
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:24,984
You just need to wait a while.
You're too young to be on your own.

468
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:30,323
I don't have to be on my own.

469
00:32:31,325 --> 00:32:32,658
I could be with you.

470
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:37,455
- With me?
- Jonah also says you're nice.

471
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,334
I try to be.

472
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:45,338
If you're nice to me,
I can be nice to you.

473
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,883
I'll do anything you want.

474
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,052
Whoa... I don't...

475
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:53,512
Rebecca, you're 15.

476
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:56,682
I don't want anything from you.

477
00:32:57,184 --> 00:32:58,851
I don't believe you.

478
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:01,520
- Look, I know what guys like.
- No.

479
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,064
Rebecca?

480
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:05,650
Go inside.

481
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:12,031
- Sally, it's not...
- Shh!

482
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:16,577
I am so sorry about Rebecca's behavior.

483
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,245
Oh.

484
00:33:18,372 --> 00:33:23,292
Just... please...
don't say anything to Arthur.

485
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:28,089
Kyle, you can't.

486
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:30,549
- Whatever you did with Rebecca...
- I didn't.

487
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:33,094
Whatever you're going to do,
I don't care.

488
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:37,431
Just, please, I'm begging you...
don't tell him.

489
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:40,726
I wouldn't.
I wouldn't. I-I won't.

490
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,186
Please.

491
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:45,439
Yeah, I promise.

492
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,274
Thank you.

493
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,077
What the hell is he doing to these people?

494
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:06,961
- Rita, hi.
- Hey. How far away are you?

495
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:10,172
Uh... Probably about an hour or so.

496
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:12,967
All right, well, I don't want you
to be surprised when you get home.

497
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:15,177
- About what?
- Cody fell into your shed.

498
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:18,139
- What? Is he OK? What happened?
- Well, he's fine.

499
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:20,516
He hit a wiffle ball
onto the top of the shed,

500
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:23,686
climbed up to get it,
the skylight cracked...

501
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:27,648
and he fell through. Elliot was
gonna push in the air conditioner...

502
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:31,318
- No, don't!
- Uh, he didn't.

503
00:34:31,445 --> 00:34:35,698
- He took off the door with an axe.
- So my shed has no door?

504
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:37,825
Dexter, Cody was scared and crying.

505
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:39,910
I told Elliot to get him out
however he could.

506
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:42,288
Yeah, of course, of course. I'll...

507
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,957
...thank Elliot when I get home.

508
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,834
Well, I'll see you soon, OK?

509
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:52,840
No one can get into
the trunk's false bottom.

510
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:55,676
You didn't think anyone
could get into your shed either.

511
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:58,012
I gotta get home. Now.

512
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:04,977
Arthur, I just got a call and I think I have to...

513
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,776
Jonah, what happened?

514
00:35:11,902 --> 00:35:15,738
- I whacked it on the coffee table.
- My son, the klutz.

515
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:19,658
This team hasn't been the same
since they traded Johnson.

516
00:35:20,494 --> 00:35:23,162
What else will he do to Jonah if I leave?

517
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:38,135
Turkey wraps, ICEEs...

518
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,513
And Cuervo Silver.

519
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:43,307
Only the best for you.

520
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,440
You know, I was thinking...

521
00:35:53,527 --> 00:35:56,654
Carl Haas's wife gets mugged.
Boom. She's dead.

522
00:35:57,531 --> 00:36:00,157
Carl gets hit by a bus.
Boom. He's a vegetable.

523
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:06,372
You never know when you
wake up in the morning

524
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:08,624
- what the day will bring...
- I love you.

525
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:14,338
I love you.

526
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,263
Are you saying that because
you're afraid you'll get hit by a bus?

527
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:25,307
No.
Well... yes, but...

528
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:33,691
I just want you to know what I know
before I don't know it anymore.

529
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,821
And I love you.

530
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,408
- I love you!
- Shh! I can hear you.

531
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:46,495
- I love Maria Esperanza del Alma La...
- Shh!

532
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:57,172
I'm not gonna say it.

533
00:37:01,303 --> 00:37:02,970
You don't love me?

534
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:06,599
I'm afraid if I say it...

535
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:11,103
something will happen,
like you'll get hit by a bus.

536
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:28,454
So watch out for moving buses.

537
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,458
'Cause I love...

538
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:36,128
Angel Juan Marcos Batista.

539
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:52,144
- Oh! Ah! Rats! Ow!
- Uh-oh. Come here, come here.

540
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:57,650
- Ooh!
- There you go. Isn't Thanksgiving fun?

541
00:37:57,776 --> 00:38:00,694
Thank God it's only once a year.
Do you have any ice?

542
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,321
No. Peas are better.

543
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:06,408
Come on, Rita. Give peas a chance.

544
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,535
- Now, come on. Take a seat.
- Oh.

545
00:38:08,662 --> 00:38:11,455
All right. OK.

546
00:38:15,752 --> 00:38:16,919
There.

547
00:38:18,672 --> 00:38:19,922
Did you say "rats"?

548
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:23,384
I guess I've been spending
too much time with the kids.

549
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:27,721
Thanks for this.

550
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:30,891
I like taking care of you.

551
00:38:43,405 --> 00:38:45,906
I am so sorry.
I don't know what I was thinking.

552
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,908
Yeah, I don't either.

553
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:51,912
It's just we have this connection,
and it's not just because we're both lonely...

554
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,748
No, I'm not lonely.
I have Dexter.

555
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:57,126
The guy who's never home?

556
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:19,606
- Thanksgiving Day parade...
- Hey, uh... Deb, I'm gonna take off.

557
00:39:19,733 --> 00:39:21,900
- Not feeling so hot.
- Oh, no, you don't.

558
00:39:23,236 --> 00:39:24,611
Here.

559
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,323
- You're my wingman.
- This family doesn't need me around.

560
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:29,825
- I'll see you at the...
- No, no, shh!

561
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:32,244
You belong here as much as anyone does.

562
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,122
And if you go,
I'll be the one single person here.

563
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:38,542
I really don't feel like remembering
why that is, you know?

564
00:39:39,753 --> 00:39:41,545
Why Frank's gone.

565
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,756
- Why I'm here.
- Yeah.

566
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:46,508
Hey...
Yeah. I'll stay.

567
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:50,554
But I need booze.

568
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:53,057
You and me both.

569
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:02,816
Hi!

570
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:07,488
Are you the one
my mom told me not to talk to?

571
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:09,823
Awkward.

572
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:13,577
...and for this bounty before us,
we thank you and look to you, O Lord,

573
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:17,206
to strengthen our resolve
to strive, to seek, to find,

574
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:20,459
- and not to yield. Amen.
- Amen.

575
00:40:21,503 --> 00:40:25,089
- Looks marvelous, Sally.
- Thank you, Arthur.

576
00:40:25,799 --> 00:40:32,012
We, uh...
We have a little... family tradition, Kyle,

577
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:34,264
before we start...

578
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,851
of saying what we're thankful for.

579
00:40:39,312 --> 00:40:42,856
I'll start.
I'm thankful for this family.

580
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:45,526
Pass your plates. Sally?

581
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:50,489
I'm... I'm thankful for this lovely home...

582
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:56,829
and for my son,
who I am so proud of.

583
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:01,333
- Me too.
- Is that all?

584
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:06,213
And for my beautiful daughter...

585
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:09,925
who is growing up... so quickly.

586
00:41:11,845 --> 00:41:13,929
I am so blessed.

587
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:20,519
I'm thankful that Mrs. Wilder
gave us an extra two days

588
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:22,729
to finish our report on Aeschylus.

589
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:28,652
And I'm also thankful
for this nice home.

590
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:32,698
Is this what it takes to survive with him?

591
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:39,371
Um, I'm thankful for this house too...

592
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:44,126
...and for God.

593
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:47,045
You know what I'm thankful for?

594
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,048
My car.

595
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:02,519
- I'm thankful for yams.
- Yams?

596
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:05,606
Comfort food.

597
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:08,692
Thank you all for the comfort
of your home.

598
00:42:08,818 --> 00:42:11,820
Where no one said
they were thankful for me.

599
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:16,033
Did you, Jonah?

600
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:20,204
Did you say you were
thankful for me, Jonah?

601
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:25,250
- What's that?
- I did not say I was thankful for you.

602
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:28,879
Because I'm not.

603
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:34,593
- I am so thankful for you, Arthur.
- Shut up, cunt.

604
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:38,722
- Whoa, Arthur...
- Kyle, perhaps it's time for you to go.

605
00:42:39,641 --> 00:42:43,477
- I think I should stay.
- Yeah, sure. Stay. Watch the show.

606
00:42:43,603 --> 00:42:46,313
- I'm thankful for you, Daddy.
- Go to your room, Vera.

607
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:48,023
No! She's not Vera!

608
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:51,985
And she's not your goddamn prisoner
and she's not eight anymore!

609
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:55,656
This whole life...
Your life is a lie!

610
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:57,950
These are lies!

611
00:42:58,952 --> 00:43:00,661
Fucking community hero?

612
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:02,621
Jonah, this isn't the way.

613
00:43:03,957 --> 00:43:06,124
I know who you really are!

614
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:08,460
- Oh, who am I?
- You're a killer.

615
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:15,259
Sucking the fucking life out of all of us!

616
00:43:15,385 --> 00:43:16,677
Mom, Becca, me!

617
00:43:16,803 --> 00:43:19,513
- Fucking little...
- No, Daddy! Don't! Daddy, no!

618
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:21,556
You're killing us!

619
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:26,645
- Put her down.
- Fuck you and fuck Vera.

620
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:28,313
Don't!

621
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:33,694
Fuck you!

622
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:42,327
Get the fuck off him!

623
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:47,666
- Oh, my God! No! No!
- No, Daddy! No!

624
00:43:51,004 --> 00:43:54,298
No, you don't have to kill him!
No! Dad! Dad!

625
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:00,012
I should have fucking killed you
when I had the chance.

626
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:07,853
- Oh, my God! Arthur!
- Daddy!

627
00:44:09,689 --> 00:44:12,024
Sally!

628
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:17,487
I'm thankful to be out of that fucking house!

629
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:21,366
You showed Trinity the monster in you.
He'll see you coming now.

630
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,327
I don't know.
Seeing them like that...

631
00:44:23,453 --> 00:44:25,579
He's destroyed everyone in that family.

632
00:44:25,705 --> 00:44:28,040
That's what happens to people
who live with a monster.

633
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:30,042
I am nothing like him!

634
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,753
My family is nothing like that.

635
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:35,630
What's 18 more years of being with you
gonna do to them?

636
00:44:35,757 --> 00:44:38,300
Arthur's terrorized them
into maintaining his cover.

637
00:44:38,426 --> 00:44:40,427
They're nothing but human shields.

638
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:45,098
The only reason you started dating Rita
was for cover.

639
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:48,060
She's much more than that now.

640
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:50,312
She and the kids. Much more.

641
00:44:55,568 --> 00:44:57,569
My family is nothing like that.

642
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:04,242
- Hey.
- Hey.

643
00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:06,620
- Dexter's home!
- Who's hungry?

644
00:45:06,746 --> 00:45:08,372
- Me.
- I am.

645
00:45:08,498 --> 00:45:11,958
I am so happy you're home!

646
00:45:12,085 --> 00:45:16,004
- Oh! Me too.
- Mm! Mm!

647
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:19,966
All right, uh...

648
00:45:20,093 --> 00:45:22,761
Cody, why don't you help
your Aunt Deb set the table?

649
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:25,555
Astor, I can use your help in the kitchen.

650
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:29,768
Sorry about your shed, Dexter.

651
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:32,604
Hey!

652
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:37,359
Well, as long as you're OK,
that's all that matters.

653
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:44,783
I'm gonna go check on the shed,
make sure it's safe in there.

654
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:46,535
Miss us?

655
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:49,788
You have no idea.

656
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:01,133
God, I miss my apartment.

657
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,891
They're safe.

658
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:12,894
So's my trunk.

659
00:46:17,066 --> 00:46:21,153
Is anything really safe here?
The kids, Rita?

660
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:27,659
- You?
- I'll find an alternative.

661
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:34,791
Trinity was supposed to be
the alternative.

662
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:44,718
Uh, spoons go inside or outside the knives?

663
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,928
Um...

664
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,014
Surprise us.

665
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:53,768
- Ouch.
- Can I see your scars, Aunt Deb?

666
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:58,648
Sure.

667
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:03,195
Does it still hurt?

668
00:47:03,863 --> 00:47:05,071
Um...

669
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:08,408
Sometimes.

670
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:11,495
Here.

671
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:14,247
Did you see that guy die?

672
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:17,918
I did.

673
00:47:19,212 --> 00:47:22,380
- I looked right in his eyes.
- Were his eyes open?

674
00:47:23,424 --> 00:47:24,508
Yeah.

675
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:28,136
Watched him take his last breath.

676
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:36,478
- How did she know that?
- How did who know what?

677
00:47:37,647 --> 00:47:39,272
Nobody but me...

678
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:42,609
How much did you tell Christine
about the Lundy shooting?

679
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:45,529
- Nothing.
- Maybe you left Lundy's file

680
00:47:45,655 --> 00:47:47,781
- lying around accidentally...
- No.

681
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:50,242
...and maybe Christine
saw some of the pictures.

682
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:52,869
She saw how he was lying on his side,
how he fell in front of me,

683
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:54,788
so that I could see him take his last...

684
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:57,749
Morgan, I'm telling you,
I learned my lesson.

685
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:59,960
I never even took the Lundy files
out of the station.

686
00:48:00,086 --> 00:48:01,711
There's no way she could have seen it.

687
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:07,092
Dinner's ready.

688
00:48:10,096 --> 00:48:12,472
Not all happy families are alike.

689
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:16,351
They are happy...

690
00:48:16,477 --> 00:48:17,769
aren't they?

691
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:20,981
Are they normal kids?

692
00:48:22,275 --> 00:48:25,485
How can you tell a loving wife
from a frightened one?

693
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:29,739
A friendly neighbor...

694
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:31,658
...co-worker...

695
00:48:31,784 --> 00:48:33,493
...sister...

696
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:35,370
...son.

697
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:39,624
Are any of them what they seem?

698
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,752
Or are they little bombs
waiting to explode?

699
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:45,589
Happy Thanksgiving, son.

700
00:48:48,801 --> 00:48:51,219
Dexter? Everything OK?

701
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:52,804
Yeah.

702
00:48:53,973 --> 00:48:55,682
It is, isn't it?

703
00:48:56,892 --> 00:49:00,520
Yes, everything is exactly
the way it should be.

704
00:49:01,397 --> 00:49:02,647
Perfect.

705
00:49:05,026 --> 00:49:06,359
Yeah, you're right.

706
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:08,945
Why don't we go around the table and
everybody say what they're thankful for?

707
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:10,572
No!

708
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:13,950
I don't want this yummy food to get cold.

709
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,411
I'm thankful for Dexter.

710
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:23,001
Let's eat.

711
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:31,343
- Sure you don't want to stay?
- I'm too tired to spend the night.

712
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:33,637
You made sure of that.

713
00:49:35,765 --> 00:49:37,349
See you tomorrow?

714
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:39,267
And the day after that...

715
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:40,852
and after that.

716
00:49:43,189 --> 00:49:46,107
- I'm here if you change your mind.
- Good night.

717
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,151
Good night.

718
00:50:06,212 --> 00:50:07,504
Joey!

719
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:14,928
Hi, Dad.
