1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,211
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,590
Deb's alive.
They're taking her to the hospital.

3
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:10,760
Trinity's a monster. If he was the one
who hurt your sister, you need to kill him.

4
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:14,055
I'm gonna follow Lundy's theory
and check his hotel room for clues.

5
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,057
You can't let these
be logged into evidence.

6
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:20,228
I've been going over everything collected
from Lundy's hotel and some of it's missing.

7
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:24,565
If you say that you saw me kill Frank Lundy,
then you're the liar.

8
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:26,776
- Nikki Wald didn't kill Lundy.
- How do you know?

9
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:28,611
Somebody stole
Lundy's Trinity research.

10
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:31,239
And there's only one person
who would have a reason to do that.

11
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:32,281
Me?

12
00:00:32,408 --> 00:00:34,200
Trinity.

13
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:38,204
If you could just help me get an interview
with Debra Morgan.

14
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,873
- You gotta be kidding me.
- It'd be a hero piece about the shooting.

15
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:44,377
No, add to that the fact that her brother
has a bug up his ass about me.

16
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:47,839
- I don't care if you're a dirty cop.
- Don't fucking call me dirty.

17
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:49,799
Last thing I need is a cop mad at me.

18
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:52,301
How are we supposed to decide
what's more important?

19
00:00:52,428 --> 00:00:53,761
Our jobs or each other?

20
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,264
- It's over.
- Right.

21
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,557
Sorry.

22
00:00:57,683 --> 00:00:59,892
I'm halfway through
the C.I. files you gave me.

23
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,477
Maybe then I'll finally get some answers.

24
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:02,979
I think I know who Dad was fucking.

25
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:05,273
What? Wait. Who?

26
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,108
I'll tell you when I know more.

27
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:09,277
I know almost everything about you, Arthur.

28
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,070
Except where you hide.

29
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,406
The dates and locations
from Lundy's books.

30
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:17,827
Arthur's been using Four Walls builds
around the country as a cover to kill.

31
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:19,787
And these are his trophies

32
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,789
hanging right up here on the wall.

33
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:25,960
He's hiding in plain sight
right in the center of his family.

34
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,462
How does he do it?

35
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:31,174
Only way it was gonna work
is if I jumped in with both feet.

36
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,843
Jump in with both feet.

37
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:33,170
There's a moment sailors call slack tide:

38
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:35,923
when the tide is neither
coming in nor going out,

39
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,717
but perfectly still.

40
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,596
It's a moment frozen in time,

41
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:44,223
when all is calm and peaceful.

42
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:54,692
The only downside to it
is that it passes so quickly.

43
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,027
Morgan.

44
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,572
Yeah, text me the address.

45
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,199
Gotta go home. Dead body.

46
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:04,201
We should get back anyway,
I got a lot to do.

47
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:05,620
I start work again tomorrow.

48
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:07,622
And you move
into your new apartment.

49
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:09,999
Yeah, taking over Dexter's old bachelor pad.

50
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,585
You can take me there
on the way home.

51
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:16,714
As much as we might like some things
to remain suspended in time,

52
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,507
they never do.

53
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,273
OK, not what I was expecting.

54
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:38,486
Well, here's the real surprise.

55
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:43,824
Mr. Nix found the alligator
on his driveway.

56
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:45,326
Come up here all the time.

57
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,328
Try to eat my dogs.

58
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,163
This one I was gonna eat.

59
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,457
He shot the animal in the head.

60
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,918
He started to gut him
and he found the arm.

61
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,343
Adult female.

62
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,720
No blood flow from
the ruptured blood vessels.

63
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,847
The bite was postmortem.

64
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,849
What's this?

65
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,184
Ligature marks.

66
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,896
- Her wrists were tied.
- I'm guessing the 'gator didn't do that.

67
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,148
Well, we got a homicide, guys.

68
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,652
Alligator Alley -
a perfect spot to dump a body,

69
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:23,155
- knowing that it won't last.
- I'll test for fingerprints.

70
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,576
Let's get a search team here.
Maybe we could find some more body parts.

71
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:29,245
A head would be nice.

72
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:41,632
Dexter, finally. You have to help me
finish my report on African animals.

73
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,884
No, I need him to put up
the shelves in my room.

74
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:46,137
Actually, guys,
it's been a long day and I'm kinda...

75
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:47,930
Go easy on him.
He's only one person.

76
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,432
That you know of.

77
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:51,851
First, you'll help Cody, then Astor,

78
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:55,563
and then you're gonna help me put
Harrison's baby bouncer together.

79
00:05:56,314 --> 00:06:00,026
- That's a lot of helping.
- Well, that's what daddies are for.

80
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,452
"Debra, call me.
I'd love to speak to you."

81
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:10,995
She called the other day too.

82
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:14,081
She wants to do a hero piece on Deb
for the paper.

83
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:17,334
The last thing I need is a reporter
snooping around my house,

84
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:19,253
my family, me.

85
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,548
I'm sick of explaining it to you.
It's like you don't even listen to me.

86
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:24,592
Maybe I would listen more...

87
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,510
I've been hearing them a lot lately.

88
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,222
They don't sound very happy, do they?

89
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,560
Better to find out now
before they get married.

90
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,898
You and I are doing better, right?

91
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:40,149
Much better.

92
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:41,942
I'm happy we're in therapy.

93
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:45,571
You've really opened up to me a lot lately,
Dexter. Don't you think?

94
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,531
Absolutely.

95
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,409
Dexter, I'm waiting.

96
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:54,872
Dear Abby,

97
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:57,833
I'm a serial killer and need advice
on how to keep my kids

98
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,627
from taking over my life.

99
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,630
No.

100
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,591
There's only one person
who can help me.

101
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,475
Arthur?

102
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:15,643
Hey.

103
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:18,312
- Hey, Kyle!
- Morning.

104
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:22,358
- Doing a little shopping?
- Yeah, just a few things. You?

105
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:25,653
Yeah, we needed some supplies
for the next build.

106
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,988
- Let me give you a hand.
- Oh, thank you.

107
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,366
I'll help you load it up.

108
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:31,992
Oh, good.

109
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:34,995
So Jonah's not around
to help you this morning?

110
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:38,249
No, he's got ROTC in the morning,

111
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,752
football practice in the afternoon.

112
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,504
Yeah, no time to help out his dad.

113
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,839
That's too bad.

114
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,757
No, no. It's a good thing.

115
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,594
- Is it?
- Kyle, you're a father.

116
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,181
You know we're responsible
to push our children out into the world,

117
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:57,476
to make them prepared, self-sufficient.

118
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,854
Right.

119
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,522
Yeah, of course.

120
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,149
Push them out. Right.

121
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:05,651
How do you do that?

122
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:09,363
You have to encourage
their outside interests.

123
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,198
Jonah's got all his activities

124
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,993
and Rebecca's got her ballet,

125
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:17,830
and she has college-level science classes.

126
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,207
That sounds very busy.

127
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,002
Well, so busy that I hardly get to see them.

128
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:25,129
And they hardly get to see you,

129
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,381
allowing you to do
whatever you want.

130
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,717
Simple advice,
but there's got to be more.

131
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:33,012
So, hey, if you ever need any extra help,
just let me know.

132
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:35,181
- Oh, thank you.
- Really, I mean it.

133
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:37,224
- Absolutely.
- It's just that...

134
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,979
Just what?

135
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:44,440
Well...

136
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,736
Honestly, I'm new here and without
my family, I don't know anybody.

137
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,279
So...

138
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,868
What are you doing tomorrow morning?

139
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:57,661
Nothing.

140
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,373
Meet me at my house.

141
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,708
6:30.

142
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,710
OK.

143
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,675
Hey, Deb, great to see you.

144
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:14,929
Welcome back, Detective.

145
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,722
- Welcome back.
- Thanks.

146
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,974
Hey.

147
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,768
You're getting a hero's welcome, I see.

148
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:21,936
Hey, welcome back.

149
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,938
Not like they haven't seen me,
I've been around.

150
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,898
Yeah, but now you're officially back.

151
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:27,691
So glad you're OK.

152
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,613
- Who was that?
- I have no fucking clue.

153
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,741
Take a bullet and suddenly
you're everybody's best friend.

154
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:38,744
Uh. On the house.

155
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:39,912
Welcome back.

156
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,292
Fat Jesus on a bike,
get me outta here.

157
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,836
Cover me, bro.

158
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:50,422
Hi. Dexter Morgan.

159
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:53,008
Of course. We met before.

160
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,928
Uh, excuse me, I have to talk...

161
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:57,972
Yeah, that's why I'm stopping you.

162
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:01,433
As a favor to me, I'd really like you
to not write about my sister.

163
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:04,979
I think she'll make a great story.

164
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,523
I should interview you as well.
You can give me some background...

165
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:10,317
No, Debra's recovering
from a serious injury.

166
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,860
She needs to be left alone.

167
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,488
Stay away.

168
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,865
Why don't you, uh,
get us a couple coffees?

169
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,122
What's with the attitude?
She's just trying to do her job.

170
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:26,166
Everybody's trying to get a piece of Debra
right now. She's been through a lot.

171
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,419
Your sister's a big girl.

172
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,671
And she can take care of herself.

173
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,007
I don't see why this is any of your business.

174
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:36,135
Look, I know you and I
have had our little differences.

175
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:38,971
You might want to keep in mind
how all that started.

176
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:41,181
So what are you saying?

177
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,350
I'm saying the guy
who saw the other guy

178
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:48,147
steal the money from the crime scene
wants Christine kept away.

179
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,609
Sorry.

180
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:54,069
Sorry I'm late.

181
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:58,032
Actually, that's bullshit.
I'm not late.

182
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:01,910
I was hiding at the end of the hall so I could
tell you all at once and get it over with.

183
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:04,872
Um... Thank you, I'm great.

184
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,206
No, I don't need your help.

185
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,584
And, no, I'm not gonna
show you the scar.

186
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,253
So, please,
can we just fucking move on?

187
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:15,215
And, uh, why is there
a picture of a fucking arm up there?

188
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:18,552
Well, let's all welcome back
Detective fuckin' Morgan.

189
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,058
I was just about to ask Sergeant Batista

190
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,060
to update us on his case.

191
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,936
Based on the fingerprints,

192
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:29,855
we've ID'd the victim

193
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:33,525
as Estrella Carazo,
19 years old.

194
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:37,279
She is a citizen of Nicaragua,
here on an expired visa.

195
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,531
Uh, the M.E. estimates that the arm

196
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:42,076
was ingested less than 72 hours ago,

197
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:45,621
and the time of death
less than 24 hours prior to that.

198
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:49,583
She worked as a cocktail waitress
at the Bayside Club,

199
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,460
but she also did some modeling.

200
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:53,921
She had a job scheduled four days ago
with a photographer

201
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,464
named Jonathan Farrow.

202
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,633
He's a big fashion photographer.

203
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,679
- That's disgusting.
- What the fuck?

204
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:04,723
That is sick.

205
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:08,268
Even I'm disturbed by this.

206
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:11,730
Ms. Carazo didn't report for work the night
after she was scheduled to see Farrow.

207
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,982
The kicker is, seven years ago
Farrow was arrested

208
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:15,484
in New York on suspicion of rape.

209
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,195
- The charges were ultimately dropped.
- So he's clean?

210
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:20,864
Well, I spoke with the lead detective
of that case,

211
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,658
he thinks the victim was paid off.

212
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:24,618
OK, so he's dirty.

213
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,787
The guy's surrounded
by a firewall of lawyers.

214
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,455
He's well-protected and playing hardball.

215
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,957
Maybe I'll get a turn at bat.

216
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,626
He's agreed to come in
for questioning this morning,

217
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,837
but I doubt if we'll get
anything out of him.

218
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:36,505
- I'd like to be there.
- OK.

219
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:38,757
Well, thank you, Ang... Sergeant Batista.

220
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,926
You're welcome, Lieutenant.

221
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,517
What's with Batista and LaGuerta?

222
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:50,018
What are you talking about?

223
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:51,812
They're afraid to look at each other.

224
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,439
Why would that be?

225
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,483
- Because they're doing it?
- Makes sense.

226
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,695
You put two people
in a room together long enough,

227
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:02,489
- eventually they're gonna fuck.
- Oh, wow.

228
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,074
That's so romantic.

229
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,618
You should have that tattooed
across your fat head.

230
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,203
What?

231
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:13,167
I'll need to find the right activity for Astor.

232
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:17,087
What did I like to do when I was 12?

233
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,923
OK, then, moving on.

234
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:36,064
Hi, this is Mr. Farrow's assistant,
hold please.

235
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:40,652
Uh, no, I'm sorry. Mr. Farrow is not available
for any bookings right now.

236
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:49,453
- You have nothing better to do?
- I wouldn't say Farrow's nothing.

237
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:51,788
Compared to Trinity he is.

238
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:54,541
Trinity's not going anywhere.

239
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,878
With his kill cycle over he's not a threat
to anyone for the time being.

240
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,797
Not sure I could say the same
about this guy.

241
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:04,593
I haven't the faintest idea
who Estrella Carazo is.

242
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:09,848
Oh, yes.

243
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,850
She had a nice arse.

244
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:15,562
I shot her in my studio last Thursday
for a Jamaican rum campaign.

245
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,398
Nothing sells rum like a nice booty.

246
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:20,442
- What time was that?
- Uh...

247
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,819
Nine a.m. till noon.

248
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:24,279
Yeah, then I drove down to the Keys

249
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:27,032
for another commercial shoot
that lasted well into the night.

250
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:28,575
That can be verified?

251
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,662
By my assistant
and about a dozen other people.

252
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:33,914
Tell me, Dexter,

253
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,459
what's the real reason
you're stalling on killing Trinity?

254
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,253
I still have things to learn from him.

255
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:43,173
I spent my entire life trying to teach you
not to be like him.

256
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:47,427
You also taught me I couldn't
be with people, couldn't get married.

257
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:50,055
You taught me a lot of things
I learned were wrong.

258
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:51,723
You're taking a risk here.

259
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:54,351
Isn't that what life is?

260
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,728
A risk?

261
00:14:56,854 --> 00:15:00,315
Any ideas who might have
wanted to harm Miss Carazo?

262
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:04,653
Look, the girl was gorgeous
but she was F.O.J.J.

263
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:06,947
F.O.J.J.?

264
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:10,784
Fresh off the jumbo jet. Yeah.

265
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,287
Very rural, you might say.

266
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:14,955
Sensitive guy.

267
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:18,417
Not like you.
I could make you a star.

268
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:21,003
I just need to get you in my studio,

269
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,714
whip your clothes off
and rough you up a little bit.

270
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:29,094
I think you just jumped to the top of my list.

271
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:36,768
It's gonna be so nice
to finally have my own place again.

272
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:45,485
Nice apartment.

273
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,029
Yeah, right?

274
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:49,156
I've wanted it for years.

275
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:50,490
Whose was it?

276
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:51,742
Dexter's.

277
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:56,997
No shit?
How come you're just now getting it?

278
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:59,333
I mean, he got married like,
what, eight months ago?

279
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,543
Well, he kind of held on to it
for a while.

280
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,045
For what, like a secret fuckpad?

281
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:06,548
No, I think he just
has a problem with change.

282
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,467
He's very slow to evolve.

283
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:12,429
- Anyway, I should be going.
- Yeah, thanks for the help.

284
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:15,474
I'm not suppose to lift anything for a while.

285
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:22,689
You kept your apartment
after you got married?

286
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,483
What kind of guy does that?

287
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,861
What are you hiding, Dexter?

288
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,655
Stay out of my life.

289
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:39,247
I know this is, like, your place now
but are you always gonna, like...

290
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,084
have people here?

291
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,419
Yes, Dex, sometimes
I'm gonna have people over.

292
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,637
This is the rest of your stuff from the house.

293
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:55,347
Thanks.

294
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:01,019
I'm picking up right where
Lundy left off with Trinity.

295
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,854
I owe him that much, right?

296
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:04,773
So look...

297
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:08,527
There are over 60 deaths
linked to Trinity.

298
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:13,740
Twelve different cities,
cases leading back to 1979.

299
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,743
I have every little iota
of evidence Frank collected

300
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,537
except what was stolen by Trinity.

301
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:23,125
And I'm gonna run it all by LaGuerta
tomorrow with the kicker...

302
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:26,712
that Trinity shot me and Lundy too.

303
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,048
Wow, that's a lot.

304
00:17:31,843 --> 00:17:33,552
Fuck, yeah, it's a lot.

305
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,305
Deb's right, but it sounds
like some mad conspiracy theory,

306
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:40,308
which is exactly what LaGuerta will think
when she hears it.

307
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:42,060
I'm gonna fuckin' blow her away.

308
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:49,234
- Are these...
- Dad's old C.I. files.

309
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,573
Didn't know you had 'em.

310
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:00,912
So you haven't told me how it's going,
your search.

311
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,750
I finally got some real info on
who Dad might have been seeing.

312
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:06,126
My mother, you mean?

313
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:09,004
- I'm having coffee with her tomorrow.
- OK, now I'm confused.

314
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,423
- Coffee?
- Her name's Valerie Hodges.

315
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:13,300
I left a message for her,
like, a month ago,

316
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,260
and she finally called me back.

317
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:19,222
Not my mother.
Debra's headed in the wrong direction.

318
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,975
But when she realizes that
and gets headed the right way,

319
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,852
Laura Moser leads to Brian Moser,

320
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:27,439
leads to the Ice Truck Killer,
leads to Harry Morgan.

321
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:31,985
So many little stepping stones
that lay a path directly to the real me.

322
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,403
Let me know how it goes.

323
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,114
I will.

324
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:42,829
Hi, Dexter.

325
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,039
- Hi, Dexter.
- Hey.

326
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:46,333
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hey, buddy.

327
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:47,793
Tough day?

328
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,798
Elliot's girlfriend
moved out this afternoon.

329
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:55,300
- Oh, that's too bad.
- What's too bad?

330
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,094
What's too bad is...

331
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:00,847
that I found all this fun stuff
for kids to do today

332
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,850
and I can't do any of it
'cause I'm too big.

333
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:04,893
Like what?

334
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:06,686
Well, for Cody,

335
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:09,856
I thought he might like
to join the Young Sailors Club.

336
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,692
- Yeah!
- Wow, that's great.

337
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:15,862
Elliot's son Danny's in that.
I think they have an outing this weekend.

338
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,155
I wanna sail.

339
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,658
Then sail you shall.

340
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,535
What about me?

341
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,620
How does soccer grab you?

342
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:26,331
- You get to kick things.
- No, thanks.

343
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,751
Well, OK, how about ballet?

344
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:30,877
Yuck.

345
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,337
OK.

346
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:35,549
How about the Little Scientists Association?

347
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:38,176
Why do you hate me so much?

348
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,722
We'll keep working on Astor.

349
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:45,475
But this is a good idea.
How did you decide to do all this?

350
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,437
Well, I feel it's my responsibility
as their father

351
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:52,732
to help push the kids
out into the world.

352
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:55,694
Make them prepared and self-sufficient.

353
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,530
I'm impressed.
Dinner's almost ready.

354
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,533
Good, I've got an early morning meeting.

355
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:20,051
OK, two serial killers go for a ride...

356
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,056
Why do I get the feeling this joke ends
with only one of them coming back?

357
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:34,691
I've barely skimmed the surface
of Arthur Mitchell.

358
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:39,696
Still so much to learn
about handling the kids and the wife.

359
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:45,535
Choose your weapon.

360
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:47,746
Or maybe not.

361
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:52,208
I have plenty of experience
with the chainsaw.

362
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:55,462
But it's heavy, difficult to wield,
has a short reach.

363
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,589
Um, axe.

364
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:20,528
This is a little too
"into the woods" for me.

365
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:23,323
So what is it
we're doing out here?

366
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:24,741
We're gonna cut down a tree.

367
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:26,451
Oh.

368
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,469
God damn it!

369
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:49,015
Want me to give it a try?

370
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,686
Stand back.

371
00:22:48,743 --> 00:22:52,203
So... about the kids...

372
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:55,915
uh, one of them doesn't wanna do
any of the things I suggested.

373
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:59,210
- So don't make them suggestions.
- What do you mean?

374
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,213
They're just children, Kyle.

375
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:03,923
If you let them do whatever they want,

376
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:07,218
they'd suck their thumbs
and diddle themselves all day.

377
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:14,934
So why did we come out here
instead of just go to the hardware store?

378
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:17,812
I don't want the lumber
in the hardware store.

379
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,440
- This is better?
- Yeah, it's better.

380
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:24,027
OK, Arthur,
you're a bit off today.

381
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:46,382
Uh...

382
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:48,468
Kyle, I didn't mean to hit it.

383
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:56,768
- Of course not. It was an accident.
- Huh, we should go.

384
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,521
It's gonna die. It's suffering.

385
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,358
It needs to be put out of its misery, Arthur.

386
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:13,910
You need to kill it.

387
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:17,163
No, I... I can't.

388
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:20,500
He spent his life
killing innocent people,

389
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:22,127
but he can't kill Bambi?

390
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:25,255
This is your new role model, Dex?

391
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,634
It's in pain, Arthur.

392
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,970
Please, I can't.

393
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:35,807
Get that axe from him.
Kill him now.

394
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,146
Would you like me to kill it?

395
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:47,193
Would you do that for me?

396
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:56,077
Now, Dexter. Kill Arthur now.

397
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:19,100
Man, early mornings with Trinity
can be murder.

398
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:20,143
Lieutenant.

399
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:23,938
The judge won't issue a search warrant
on Farrow's studio.

400
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:26,441
- No probable cause.
- Well, that's bad news.

401
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:28,568
Very, 'cause I'm still sure he's our guy.

402
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:30,361
I think this means he's my guy.

403
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,989
And this case may be bigger
than what we originally thought.

404
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:35,241
I've got the names
of at least three models

405
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,619
from Central and South America who have

406
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:40,246
- all gone missing over the past year.
- All here illegally.

407
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:43,458
Now, we know that
at least one of them worked for Farrow.

408
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:46,794
I figure he picks his victims
knowing that once they've disappeared,

409
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:49,631
their families have no way of
getting an investigation started.

410
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:52,133
And I can't get a search warrant
on this come mierda.

411
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:55,762
Fortunately, unlike Batista,
I don't need a search warrant.

412
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,722
Keep working it.
Find another way in.

413
00:26:04,939 --> 00:26:08,107
Can I ask you something?
Off the record.

414
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:09,901
Go for it.

415
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:14,614
Is it true that you and Batista
are in some kind of relationship?

416
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,491
Excuse me, Detective?

417
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,663
- It's just there's a rumor going around...
- Then please stop spreading it.

418
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:24,332
As a fellow woman
in a largely male workforce,

419
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:27,919
I'd think you'd have a little more sensitivity
to this kind of situation.

420
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:30,964
Sergeant Batista and I
are co-workers and friends.

421
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:35,593
Shit.

422
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:42,100
Farrow has a reputation for partying
late into the night.

423
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,895
And tonight should be no different.

424
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,949
Farrow's trusty assistant closing up shop.

425
00:26:58,075 --> 00:26:59,742
Right on schedule.

426
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:12,357
Estrella Carazo.

427
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,860
Are those tears for real?

428
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:38,257
I know you like to create
images of violence,

429
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:40,301
but this isn't fake blood I'm seeing.

430
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,929
Someone was hit right here.

431
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:49,477
Managed to make it this far
before she was...

432
00:28:52,815 --> 00:28:54,732
hit again.

433
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:57,902
And then here.

434
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:06,452
A fingernail.

435
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:21,008
Not exactly Cinderella's glass slipper.

436
00:29:21,135 --> 00:29:22,760
But it is a fit.

437
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:53,916
- Valerie?
- That would be me.

438
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,252
- Debra Morgan.
- I figured. Sit down.

439
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:59,005
I left you messages weeks ago.
I figured you weren't gonna call.

440
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:00,840
Well, I was on a cruise.

441
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:03,968
Rich old men love to spend money on me.

442
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:08,514
Um... So you used to work for my dad,
Harry Morgan?

443
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,557
I did.

444
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:12,643
I still have my sources,
if that's what you're wondering.

445
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,061
Pick up where we left off.

446
00:30:14,188 --> 00:30:16,647
Of course, my fee's gonna be
a little higher now.

447
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:19,609
No, actually, I just wanted
to ask you about my dad.

448
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:24,489
Did you and my father...

449
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:29,660
Did you ever
have a romantic relationship?

450
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,497
Oh, um,

451
00:30:32,623 --> 00:30:36,167
I'm not sure
romantic is the right word.

452
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:39,712
I was one of his girlfriends,
if that's what you're asking.

453
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:42,507
There were others?

454
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:47,762
I think he picked the C.I.s
based on how good we were in the sack.

455
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,850
I'm sorry, that's just...

456
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,063
that's just not the picture
I have of my dad.

457
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:59,232
Oh...

458
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:03,569
Hey, I knew he was a hound
when I met him, we all did.

459
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,281
I was one of his favorites, though.

460
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:10,284
I used to drive him crazy
with this one thing...

461
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,703
That's... That's... That's enough.

462
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:16,374
Thank you. Thanks.

463
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:19,877
Does this mean you're not gonna hire me?

464
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:25,758
I should have listened to everybody.

465
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,969
It was a huge mistake
to look into Dad's past.

466
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:30,429
- What happened?
- It's too much.

467
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:33,432
- I don't need to know all this stuff.
- What stuff?

468
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:35,935
Dad was fucking Valerie Hodges.

469
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:40,106
- Really?
- But apparently she was just one of many.

470
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:43,401
It's every father's nightmare...

471
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:45,111
disappointing his children.

472
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:47,405
That doesn't sound like Harry.

473
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:48,739
Thank you, Dex.

474
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:51,284
I don't even know
who Harry is anymore.

475
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:54,537
He's still everything
you remember him to be.

476
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:56,789
Is he?

477
00:31:57,708 --> 00:31:59,375
We all have secrets, Deb.

478
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,254
Some of them
shouldn't be found out.

479
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:07,008
I don't have any secrets like that.

480
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,512
No, me neither.

481
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,431
I should just leave it alone.

482
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:16,142
My mother.

483
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:19,562
Yeah, I think that's probably
for the best.

484
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:23,274
- I'll turn these in and be done with it.
- No, you don't have to. I'll do it.

485
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,026
Thanks.

486
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,537
You need to destroy that file, Dexter.

487
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:38,122
Close that door forever.

488
00:33:01,438 --> 00:33:03,939
I can't let her be cut up again.

489
00:33:14,785 --> 00:33:16,077
Hey.

490
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:18,037
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hey.

491
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:19,372
Not another gift.

492
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:23,167
No, it's not a gift.
It's a push, remember?

493
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:29,548
- What's that for?
- It's for you. It's your new guitar.

494
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:30,883
Why?

495
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:34,011
- 'Cause you're gonna take guitar lessons.
- Says who?

496
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:36,222
Me.

497
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:37,848
We'll see.

498
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:46,816
I learned a long time ago you can't force
them to do things they don't wanna do.

499
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:49,151
Yeah, I guess.

500
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,445
So are you ready
for your big weekend?

501
00:33:53,115 --> 00:33:54,240
What big weekend?

502
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:57,326
The overnight camping trip
with the young sailors.

503
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:01,956
I'm not a young sailor; Cody is.
I'm a 30-something sailor.

504
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:04,125
But you have to go with him.
That's part of the deal.

505
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:06,419
They need adults with boats.

506
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:09,088
You're signed up
to take four of the boys.

507
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:11,215
I didn't realize that.

508
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:20,975
I didn't know I'd have to get so involved.
This isn't a good weekend for me.

509
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:23,811
Dexter, what do you have to do
that's so important?

510
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:25,896
Stuff.

511
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:28,941
- Stuff?
- Stuff.

512
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,569
You can't cancel
because of "stuff".

513
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:33,362
Cody will be so disappointed.

514
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,408
Well, what time do we have to leave
in the morning?

515
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:39,744
You have to meet
at the docks at eight a.m.

516
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:42,413
If I can't do Farrow tomorrow,
I'll do him tonight.

517
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:44,373
Everything's ready.

518
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:47,501
Where are you going?

519
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,170
I gotta prep the boat.

520
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:53,007
If we're camping out, we'll need a tent,
sleeping bags, food, water.

521
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:55,342
I gotta get two children's life vests.

522
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:57,970
Abduct Jonathan Farrow
take him back to his studio,

523
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,639
kill him, cut him to pieces,
dump him in the ocean.

524
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:03,350
Honestly, Rita,
this is gonna take me a while.

525
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:07,188
- Do you need some help?
- No, I got it.

526
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,899
This really means a lot to Cody.

527
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,027
Me too.

528
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:21,202
And suddenly...

529
00:35:21,328 --> 00:35:23,162
tonight's the night.

530
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:26,499
Jonathan Farrow, party animal.

531
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:30,044
OK, Jonathan,
party like there's no tomorrow.

532
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:40,095
I'm on Mr. Farrow's list.

533
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:27,434
I don't have all night.
Neither does Jonathan Farrow.

534
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:30,229
Excuse me,
could you tell Mr. Farrow

535
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:34,108
I just saw a homeless guy throwing up
in the back seat of his car?

536
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:00,467
Quinn?

537
00:37:00,594 --> 00:37:03,888
What is he doing here?
It couldn't be coincidence.

538
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:07,141
This whole thing
just became too risky.

539
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,897
Can you believe he's here?

540
00:37:14,024 --> 00:37:15,482
Uh, who is he?

541
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:18,360
That's Quinn.

542
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,279
I've never heard of him.

543
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:22,615
You'd be making a big mistake.

544
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,256
Hello.

545
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:41,425
Hello yourself.

546
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:42,968
You must be Quinn.

547
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,595
I am.

548
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:50,935
This lab geek
just fucking ditched me?

549
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,982
OK, tonight's not the night.

550
00:37:57,108 --> 00:38:00,027
Guess I'm prepping the boat
to go camping after all.

551
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:27,846
The Biscayne Bay, boys!

552
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:32,184
Home to the Seminole Indians,
the Spanish conquistadors,

553
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,852
cutthroat pirates...

554
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:37,147
And now Dexter Morgan
and four skinny boys.

555
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:40,150
Harry used to take me camping.

556
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:42,277
If I can't kill Jonathan Farrow tonight,

557
00:38:42,404 --> 00:38:45,489
at least I can make the most
of my time with Cody.

558
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:48,010
See, you just pull it tight,
like that,

559
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:49,845
and that's your bowline.

560
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:51,472
That's my personal favorite.

561
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:54,391
You might prefer a taut-line hitch.
I'll show you on the other side.

562
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:56,101
Or maybe you wanna see a trucker's hitch.

563
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,936
- That's a fun one.
- Dexter?

564
00:39:58,855 --> 00:39:59,813
What?

565
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:02,107
Can I throw dirt clods?

566
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,901
Oh, OK.

567
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:07,488
You forgot the rope.

568
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:09,239
Right.

569
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,286
You seem a little distracted.

570
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,747
Yeah, well, Arthur's technique
of keeping the kids busy

571
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:19,792
and therefore keeping me free
isn't working out like it was supposed to.

572
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:22,044
So maybe it's time to kill him.

573
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:24,254
After Farrow.

574
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,156
Hey.

575
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,408
I just got the official go-ahead
from LaGuerta

576
00:40:53,535 --> 00:40:56,411
to open a Trinity Killer investigation.

577
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:58,539
Really?

578
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:02,084
She went for the whole...

579
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,669
serial killer thing?

580
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:07,506
OK, let's call it
a limited Trinity investigation.

581
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:09,091
What's that mean?

582
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:12,219
Right before I went in, I realized
if I pitched the entire Trinity theory

583
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:15,347
and I added that he also
shot me and Lundy,

584
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:18,809
I'd look like a fucking lunatic, so I boiled it
down to the bare essentials.

585
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:20,936
Which are?

586
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:23,647
The bludgeonings.
They still go back 30 years.

587
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:27,401
So I can investigate Trinity without LaGuerta
knowing I'm investigating Trinity.

588
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,320
Smart.

589
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:32,072
What's the next step?

590
00:41:32,866 --> 00:41:35,033
I don't know.

591
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:38,495
I don't know, but what I do know
is that Trinity killed Frank.

592
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,330
And I'm gonna catch him.

593
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:42,124
I'm sure you will.

594
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:51,675
So, Sarge.
What's this about you and LaGuerta?

595
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:53,177
A little bump and grind?

596
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:58,682
Do not talk about Lieutenant LaGuerta
that way. Comprende?

597
00:41:58,808 --> 00:42:00,350
Wow.

598
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:01,685
Sorry.

599
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:03,478
You must really dig her.

600
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:16,742
- Angel.
- Quinn just asked me

601
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:19,411
if you and I were
bumping and grinding.

602
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:23,749
Debra Morgan
asked me the same thing.

603
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,417
Well, not in those words.

604
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,961
- Where are they getting this from?
- I don't know.

605
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:29,379
It's you.

606
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:32,049
The way you keep looking at me.

607
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:34,259
Everywhere I go
you're staring at my culo.

608
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:37,221
OK, that is so not true.

609
00:42:37,347 --> 00:42:38,347
It is too.

610
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:39,890
Now I know...

611
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:42,768
that I have a pretty nice ass...

612
00:42:43,937 --> 00:42:45,771
...but you gotta stop.

613
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:53,237
I miss you, Angel.

614
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,241
I miss you too.

615
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:02,412
- But we made our choice.
- Yeah, yeah.

616
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:12,130
When all of a sudden,

617
00:43:12,257 --> 00:43:14,967
they heard a scratching noise
on the roof of the car.

618
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:23,350
"What was that?"
And they thought, "Let's get outta here."

619
00:43:23,476 --> 00:43:25,894
And they drove home
as fast as they could.

620
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,604
And when they got home,

621
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:31,984
he went around to open the car door
for his girlfriend,

622
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:35,487
and there hanging from the handle,

623
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,698
a bloody hook!

624
00:43:41,911 --> 00:43:44,329
That doesn't even make sense.

625
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:45,831
Your turn, Dexter.

626
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:50,335
Uh, actually, I don't know any scary stories.

627
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:53,463
- Oh, come on. Give it a shot.
- Come on.

628
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,091
All right.

629
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:00,971
There's a man.

630
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:07,269
You can call him
the Man of Three.

631
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:09,062
You can call him Trinity.

632
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:15,110
You can call him anything you want
but the fact is he's not a man at all,

633
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:16,778
he's a monster.

634
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:21,033
He was born in a bathtub
filled with blood.

635
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:27,039
For countless years he's roamed
the countryside killing the innocent,

636
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:30,959
leaving behind
bits of his dead sister.

637
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:37,924
Sometimes he'll sneak up on a man

638
00:44:38,051 --> 00:44:40,802
and raise his hammer overhead...

639
00:44:42,347 --> 00:44:43,597
and then he'll swing it down...

640
00:44:43,723 --> 00:44:46,558
Smash his own thumb
and then go crying all the way home,

641
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,226
like a little baby.

642
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:51,021
That's what happens!

643
00:44:52,732 --> 00:44:55,150
- That was funny.
- Thanks.

644
00:44:55,276 --> 00:44:57,819
And now I think it's time
to hit the sleeping bags.

645
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:01,365
You guys are beat.
You've had a huge day.

646
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:25,680
Hey, buddy.

647
00:45:25,807 --> 00:45:27,265
You need anything?

648
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:28,433
I'm good.

649
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,227
Do you need anything?

650
00:45:31,354 --> 00:45:33,355
No, I'm good too.

651
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:49,746
It's only nine o'clock.

652
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:51,790
The kids won't wake up till it's light out.

653
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:53,583
Plenty of time for me.

654
00:47:09,494 --> 00:47:12,829
What the hell is going on?
What is this?

655
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:14,289
This...

656
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,043
is the decisive moment.

657
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:26,593
What's the name of the photographer
who always talked about that?

658
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:29,387
- Cartier-Bresson.
- Right. Right.

659
00:47:32,016 --> 00:47:33,892
Once you miss it
it's gone forever,

660
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:35,894
a perfect moment...

661
00:47:36,938 --> 00:47:39,105
frozen in time.

662
00:47:39,232 --> 00:47:41,608
Something like that, right?

663
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:43,068
Yes, but...

664
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:45,904
Ow! Fuck, fuck, fuck!

665
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,324
Who are you?

666
00:47:50,535 --> 00:47:54,538
I'm the person who's going to keep you
from killing any more women.

667
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:58,375
What? I've never killed anyone.

668
00:47:59,502 --> 00:48:02,504
You killed Estrella Carazo.

669
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,423
Who knows how many others?

670
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:09,177
I didn't fucking kill them!
I photographed them!

671
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:13,557
- It's too fucking bad they're dead but I...
- "Too fucking bad they're dead."

672
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:16,434
Life is... is hard,

673
00:48:16,561 --> 00:48:18,436
and it's brutal and ugly,

674
00:48:18,563 --> 00:48:20,355
and way too fucking short!

675
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:23,608
That's why I shoot what I do,
beautiful women!

676
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:27,779
Who are bruised and cut and bleeding.

677
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:28,947
Oh, fuck.

678
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:31,950
It's for the contrast!

679
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:35,787
You add a little bit of the real world.
It makes them all the more beautiful.

680
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:37,455
Until you kill them.

681
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:42,919
If they could thank me,
they fucking would.

682
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:46,339
Because of my pictures,
those women will live on forever!

683
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,592
Nothing lasts forever.

684
00:49:04,525 --> 00:49:07,319
Man has always been drawn to the sea.

685
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:14,284
But it's an unnatural setting for us,

686
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:16,411
a place of great danger.

687
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:28,506
Tides, currents,

688
00:49:28,633 --> 00:49:31,092
waves, wind...

689
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:34,054
each presenting their own hazards,

690
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:35,847
none of which can be ignored.

691
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:45,190
The slightest lapse of judgment

692
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:48,652
can be a mistake
you might never recover from.

693
00:49:52,198 --> 00:49:56,701
But a good sailor doesn't fight
against these elements.

694
00:50:07,171 --> 00:50:11,549
A good sailor works with them,
using them to his advantage.

695
00:50:11,676 --> 00:50:15,512
While others less fortunate
might be forever cast adrift,

696
00:50:15,638 --> 00:50:18,139
often in several pieces,

697
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:20,225
he always comes home safely.

698
00:50:40,913 --> 00:50:42,580
What the hell?

699
00:50:47,837 --> 00:50:49,921
- Isn't that...
- Farrow's assistant.

700
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:52,882
I just arrested him
for the murder of Estrella Carazo.

701
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:55,593
- But, no, I thought...
- Yeah.

702
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,804
At first it looked like Farrow,
but this is airtight.

703
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:01,808
We got camera footage from the tollbooth
of him heading over to Alligator Alley.

704
00:51:01,934 --> 00:51:04,561
We got DNA evidence.
We got everything.

705
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:31,296
I killed an innocent man.
