1
00:00:02,044 --> 00:00:03,419
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:05,713
It's always the same
three kills with Trinity.

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,716
Young woman in a bathtub...

4
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:11,594
...followed by a mother falling to her death...

5
00:00:13,389 --> 00:00:15,431
...and ending with a man getting bludgeoned.

6
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:20,061
Trinity's likely someone
who's gone his own solitary way through life,

7
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:23,314
foregone all but the most rudimentary
of human connections.

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,774
A lone wolf.

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,193
If we can find where
he bludgeoned back then...

10
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:31,614
Lobby's open 24 hours, guard on duty.
Too much foot traffic.

11
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,368
- Trinity'd have to choose another floor...
- Ooh! So sorry.

12
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:37,620
Wasn't watching where I was going.

13
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:41,624
White male, eyes blue.
Something in them.

14
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,127
Super-agent Lundy has a hunch

15
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:47,255
that the dead woman is connected
to this big serial-killer case.

16
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,257
You still dating
that she-bag reporter?

17
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,175
After she put Lundy's name in the paper?

18
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,428
Is this conversation
gonna end up in the paper too?

19
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:55,638
You have no idea the shitstorm
you've gotten me into.

20
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,682
Find yourself another source.

21
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:00,643
Just unsealed the juvie records
of Johnny Rose,

22
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:02,311
our Vacation Murder suspect.

23
00:01:02,438 --> 00:01:04,564
Shoplifting with his high-school girlfriend,
Nikki Wald.

24
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,274
Get down!

25
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,152
I think we should inform the brass
about our relationship.

26
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:11,028
It's none of their business.

27
00:01:11,155 --> 00:01:13,281
I get a gig in town
to spend more time with you,

28
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:16,492
and you spend all your time with your ex.

29
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:22,957
- Don't go disappearing on me again.
- Not a...

30
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,809
- Deb.
- Hey, you. Back behind the line.

31
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,645
No, I was called here. I'm Dexter Morgan.
That might be my sister.

32
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,440
I understand, sir, but I need you to step back
and let our people do their job.

33
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:56,277
No, I'm with Miami Metro. Forensics.
My laminate and my wallet are in the car.

34
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,154
Until I see some ID,
I need you to step back.

35
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,656
And I need you to fucking listen.
My sister was shot.

36
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:03,618
No one can tell me what her condition is,
and that's a dead body.

37
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:07,371
- Sir...
- You want to let me go.

38
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,625
Hansen!
Hands off. He's one of us.

39
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:16,047
Deb's alive. OK?
They're taking her to the hospital.

40
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,133
I have to see her.

41
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,969
- How bad is it?
- She's lost a lot of blood.

42
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,976
If Deb dies, I'll be...

43
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:31,771
...lost.

44
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:34,523
Paramedics think the bullets
are through and through.

45
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,859
- She's gonna be OK?
- It's looking good.

46
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:43,658
- Who did this?
- We got here just before you did.

47
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,701
Quinn was first on scene.

48
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:50,039
He says it's smelling
like a Vacation Murders MO.

49
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:52,625
- Then that's...
- Lundy.

50
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:01,425
What was Deb doing with Lundy
at five in the morning?

51
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:05,888
- Oh.
- Dexter, I swear to you,

52
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,015
we will find who did this.

53
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:11,560
- My kit's in my car.
- Hey, hey, hey.

54
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:14,355
You got better places to be.
Like with your sister.

55
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:17,775
- Go. That's an order.
- You'll know the minute we know anything.

56
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:25,408
Lundy was a worthy adversary.

57
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:29,120
He deserves better than to be face down
in a hotel parking lot.

58
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,541
A random victim of a senseless crime.

59
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:37,670
- I'm sorry about Deb, man.
- Did she say anything?

60
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:40,006
She was in shock.
Didn't see who pulled the trigger.

61
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:42,675
Batista said you think
this looks like the Vacation Murders.

62
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,886
Deb's cash and credit cards are gone.
So's Lundy's watch and wallet.

63
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,438
Anything, Vince?

64
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:58,607
Surgeon General wouldn't have been
able to save him.

65
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:02,236
GSWs to the neck and chest.
He bled out in seconds.

66
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,071
Lundy was shot twice?

67
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,534
Deb was vulnerable
and a potential witness.

68
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,580
The shooter could have easily
finished her off like Lundy.

69
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,540
I should get to the hospital.

70
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:18,753
Deb, she knows,
even though we go at it all the time...

71
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:22,715
- We're still...
- Yeah, she knows.

72
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,302
We're gonna get these fuckers.

73
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:29,722
Not if you're looking in the wrong direction.

74
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:33,809
Detective Quinn.

75
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:36,187
Not now. Really.

76
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:37,938
I didn't come here for a quote.

77
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:41,317
- You all right?
- My partner's been shot.

78
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:42,777
The last thing I am is all right.

79
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,613
Yeah. I know this can't be easy,

80
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:49,075
but... if you need anything...

81
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:54,121
- I'm here for you.
- Thanks, Christine. That means a lot.

82
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,040
I gotta...

83
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,833
- It's OK.
- All right.

84
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,713
- Sergeant Batista...
- No comment.

85
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,882
Ah! Come on, Sergeant.

86
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,218
Is this the work
of the Vacation Murderers?

87
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,011
I said, no...

88
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,643
On the record.

89
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:20,397
It's too early to tell,
but one of 'em, Johnny Rose,

90
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:22,650
we found out has syphilis.

91
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,735
And it's real bad. Untreatable.

92
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,445
Multiple partners.

93
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:28,614
Print that.

94
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,282
With pictures.

95
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:36,539
I call it in now, it'll be online this morning
and on the stands this afternoon.

96
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:38,207
With pictures.

97
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:49,510
While my colleagues
are working the Vacation Murder theory,

98
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:52,930
I'm gonna follow Lundy's theory
and check his hotel room for clues.

99
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:56,475
Lundy devoted his life to hunting Trinity.

100
00:07:56,601 --> 00:08:00,813
He left word for me, he'd had
an interesting encounter two days ago.

101
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:03,941
You think it was Trinity?

102
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,737
Every crime scene is a jigsaw puzzle.
So many pieces.

103
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:11,740
Assemble them right,
a picture forms.

104
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:16,412
If it was Trinity, it'd explain
why Deb is alive and Lundy isn't.

105
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:18,038
Trinity's a monster.

106
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:22,042
If he was the one that hurt your sister,
you need to kill him.

107
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,546
That was my blood down there too.

108
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,924
You can't let these be logged into evidence.

109
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,138
Not until I have a complete picture.

110
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:48,777
Police so far are refusing to comment
on the murder of a former FBI agent

111
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:51,030
and the shooting
of a Miami Metro Homicide detective.

112
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:52,281
But Channel 9 has learned

113
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:55,618
there may be a connection
to the so-called Vacation Murders.

114
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:56,785
Sources tell us that...

115
00:08:56,912 --> 00:08:59,955
All right. Denver omelet, side of rye toast.

116
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,124
Can I top that off for you?

117
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,794
Coffee's fine, but there are
no diced tomatoes in my omelet.

118
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:09,215
I'm sorry about that.
Cook is slammed today.

119
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:12,635
I'll bring you a side of tomatoes.
How's that coffee?

120
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:14,178
My coffee's not the issue.

121
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:17,640
My breakfast, on the other hand, is.

122
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,266
You need to start over.

123
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:23,604
Denver omelet.
With tomatoes. Diced.

124
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:26,106
Coming right up.

125
00:09:28,652 --> 00:09:30,527
You're a dear. Thanks.

126
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,825
- Astor, will you get that?
- But it's Dexter's.

127
00:09:36,952 --> 00:09:39,703
Oh, it's OK. He was in such a hurry
he probably forgot it.

128
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,623
- Could be the hospital.
- Is Aunt Deb gonna die?

129
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,959
Oh, no, honey.
No, she's gonna be OK.

130
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:48,671
Some man,
he says he's Dexter's landlord.

131
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:51,173
There's something wrong
with Dexter's apartment.

132
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,717
There's got to be a misunderstanding.
All right, go.

133
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,345
Uh, yes, hi.
This is Rita Morgan.

134
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:12,152
How long have you been there?

135
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,529
Not long.

136
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,658
You're sitting up. It's a good sign.

137
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,743
I'm fine.

138
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,997
I didn't even need surgery.

139
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:27,960
Couple stitches.

140
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,672
Looks like more than a couple.

141
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,967
You have any pain?

142
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,596
No. Just tired.

143
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,393
Whatever they gave me has some kick.

144
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,354
- You want me to come back?
- It's OK. I'm fine.

145
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,068
You remember anything... at all?

146
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,987
You see anything unusual?

147
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,366
It's all still a blur.

148
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,410
Who was hit first? You, or...

149
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:03,871
Jesus, Dex.

150
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,414
Am I squeezing too tight?

151
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,877
I expect those kind of questions
from Batista or Quinn, but not my brother.

152
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:13,172
You said you were fine. Twice.

153
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:18,469
- Doesn't matter, anyway.
- Just tell me what you want me to do.

154
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,805
That's just it.

155
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:25,893
You can't do anything.

156
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:28,729
No one can.

157
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,398
I didn't feel anything.

158
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:39,031
I didn't even know I'd been hit
till I was on the ground.

159
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,285
And then two more shots.

160
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:49,917
So much blood.

161
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,546
You're safe.

162
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,091
I'm here.

163
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,927
Lundy had this look in his eyes.

164
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,765
Like he was apologizing.

165
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,395
I couldn't do anything.

166
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,690
I was helpless.

167
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:20,406
Fuck, I can't even walk three feet
to the bathroom.

168
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:22,074
Do you need to...

169
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,993
Yeah! Bad.

170
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,870
Come on.

171
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,297
- OK?
- Mm-hm.

172
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:44,138
I may not know who shot my sister

173
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,223
or why her life was spared,

174
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,018
but I do know
I won't be returning the favor.

175
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:59,027
Oh, God. Deb, is she...

176
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:00,195
Peeing.

177
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:05,451
I'll just...

178
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:09,413
uh... be outside.

179
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:14,793
- Hey.
- How's Deb?

180
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,713
She's lucky to be alive.

181
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,381
I was so worried.

182
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,886
- Can I see her?
- Uh, she's peeing.

183
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:25,471
With Anton.

184
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:31,018
I would have been here sooner,
but I got hung up on the phone.

185
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,478
Your landlord called.

186
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:37,107
A pipe burst in your kitchen...
at your apartment.

187
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,525
Oh.

188
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:45,032
I was just hanging on to the place
until the lease ran out.

189
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:49,578
- So I could get the security deposit back.
- Why'd you tell me you got rid of it?

190
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:51,538
I said that?

191
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,833
We'll talk about this later.

192
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,377
This isn't the time or the place,
not with Deb here.

193
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,464
Family comes first.

194
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,551
I'm just so sorry I wasn't here.

195
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,763
You don't have to keep saying that.

196
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:10,974
I'm so glad you're all right.

197
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:13,477
I'm not.

198
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,979
Babe, what is it?

199
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,861
I slept with Lundy.

200
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,039
I thought you were happy.

201
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,918
I thought I was too.

202
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:43,131
I can move out.

203
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:44,716
No. No. No.

204
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,971
Listen, I'll see you through this, OK?
You did the same for me.

205
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,722
Anton, stop.

206
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:55,894
You deserve so much better.

207
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,940
Is that what you want?

208
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:06,697
Sorry I hurt you.

209
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,715
Anton?

210
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:33,265
- Toma, chula.
- Gracias.

211
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:36,852
Just hung up from notifying
Lundy's daughter.

212
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:40,314
Then you could really use
a shot of whiskey in there.

213
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:45,485
I get that the guy's
personally invested in this,

214
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:49,406
but Matthews hovering around like a vulture
isn't gonna help us catch bad guys.

215
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:51,158
Angel...

216
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,622
I made official disclosure yesterday
that we're seeing each other.

217
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:02,169
- We talked about this.
- I know.

218
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,089
But it was the right thing to do.

219
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:09,593
I said I was uncomfortable
with the disclosure stuff,

220
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:13,096
- and you go ahead and do it anyway?
- I made a judgment call.

221
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,266
The problem, Maria...

222
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,353
is that you made it for the both of us.

223
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:24,608
You shouldn't keep
the Deputy Chief waiting.

224
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,414
- What do we got?
- Not much.

225
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,334
No witnesses, no security cameras.
Took a statement from Deb,

226
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,628
- she can't remember seeing anything.
- Forensics.

227
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:46,505
Waiting on trace and ballistics from the lab.

228
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:48,173
APBs out on Rose and Wald.

229
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:51,593
County's increased patrols at the airport,
and the higher-profile tourist hotels.

230
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:55,555
If my face was all over the media
for shooting a cop and a Fed,

231
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:58,392
I'd be digging a fucking hole
all the way to China.

232
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,477
No one fuckin' go there.

233
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:04,147
Or you'd be watching the press
to try and stay one step ahead of us.

234
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,109
It's a Hail Mary, but I planted a story
with Quinn's girlfriend.

235
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:08,485
She's not... We're not...

236
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:11,822
You're the paper's unnamed online source
about Johnny boy's drip?

237
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:14,491
I figure if Johnny has syphilis...

238
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:17,703
and Nikki wasn't listed by the county
as one of his sexual partners...

239
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,579
- She may not know.
- Exactly.

240
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:25,544
Maybe we turn these two
against each other.

241
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:32,217
Rita was right - family does come first.

242
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:35,262
Finding who did this to my sister
comes first.

243
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:38,140
Is this a new page of the code?

244
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:39,808
Revenge?

245
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:45,647
My sanctuary.

246
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,733
It's private and...

247
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:49,276
sacred no more.

248
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,998
If I have to give up this place,
what will I do about my roommate...

249
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:05,417
the dark passenger?

250
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:11,006
This apartment is the only thing
that's helped me keep the mask in place.

251
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:13,008
And without it...

252
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:15,302
I'll burst.

253
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,558
They're letting me out tomorrow.

254
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:23,685
That's great.

255
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:27,022
- Any chance you can give me a ride?
- Of course.

256
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:31,526
I'm also kind of gonna need a place to stay.
I broke up with Anton.

257
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:35,572
- And, no, I don't wanna talk about it.
- We can make room for you.

258
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:37,199
Rita won't mind?

259
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:39,826
Don't worry, Deb, I'll take care of everything.

260
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,043
Trinity's a lone wolf.

261
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:51,046
Unable to connect,
except with his victims.

262
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:54,049
He never deviates.

263
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:56,343
Bleeds out a young female in a bathtub...

264
00:18:58,012 --> 00:19:00,514
forces a woman to jump to her death...

265
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:03,016
and five days later...

266
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:05,435
bludgeons an older male.

267
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,563
I'll look at potential sites.

268
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:11,858
This may be the closest to Trinity
I've ever been.

269
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:14,945
Lundy got closer than he thought.

270
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:20,659
He just couldn't see how
all the pieces interlock, what they form.

271
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,375
A sacred ritual.

272
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,839
If there's anyone who knows
the importance of ritual...

273
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:35,090
it's you.

274
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:38,051
Lundy underestimated
how far Trinity would go

275
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,846
to make sure his ritual wasn't interrupted.

276
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:42,889
Lundy was an obstacle.

277
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,350
And Trinity killed him.

278
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:52,607
If anyone has ever deserved to be
on your table, it's this son of a bitch.

279
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:08,123
Can I help you?

280
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:09,875
I'm taking on a project.

281
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:11,293
How big?

282
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:13,128
Almost more than I can handle.

283
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,131
And I don't have a lot of time.

284
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:17,757
Maybe you need another hand or two.

285
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:20,802
- There's plenty of laborers out there...
- No, no.

286
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,804
I work alone.

287
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,348
Sounds like you need
the right tool for the job.

288
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,933
So much work.

289
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:30,979
But I have to finish what I started, right?

290
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:33,231
Yeah, I... I guess.

291
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:38,486
What would you do?

292
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:39,696
Me?

293
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:42,657
Oh, I'd go with the framing hammer.

294
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,993
Got a lot of heft.
It's versatile.

295
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:48,204
You can't go wrong.

296
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,250
Yeah, I see what you mean.

297
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:58,131
You've been very helpful.

298
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,660
Lobby's open 24 hours.

299
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:29,329
12-story building, hundreds of rooms.

300
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:31,373
Trinity could strike anywhere.

301
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:33,708
He'll have to set up shop
in the surveillance room.

302
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:36,086
Trinity's the perfect predator.

303
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:39,214
Camouflaged,
waiting for his victim to be alone,

304
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,091
and then he strikes.

305
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:44,052
Trinity struck here 30 years ago.

306
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:48,890
A bartender... father of two,
was found bludgeoned to death

307
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:52,102
in the men's room of a tavern
at this same address.

308
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:54,521
If history is going to repeat itself,

309
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,524
this is where Trinity will be.

310
00:21:58,693 --> 00:22:01,653
Problem is, you have no idea
who you're looking for.

311
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:04,030
Lundy was so methodical,

312
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,741
he would have commented
on Trinity's physical appearance

313
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,576
if their paths had ever crossed,

314
00:22:08,703 --> 00:22:11,037
but there's nothing in his tapes.

315
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,206
I've listened to them all.

316
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:17,210
You sure about that? That's your recorder.
Where's Lundy's?

317
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,174
It wasn't in the hotel,
because Lundy had it on him.

318
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:27,220
Then it's been logged into evidence. Shit.

319
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:31,141
Dexter, you need that tape. You need
to be certain it's Trinity on your table.

320
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:34,352
There's still time. He won't complete
the cycle until tomorrow night,

321
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,062
and I'll be here...

322
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,189
waiting.

323
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,734
Oh, God!

324
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:42,902
Oh!

325
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:03,048
- That was, uh...
- Unexpected.

326
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,259
That's not an adjective I usually hear.

327
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:08,678
I'm not complaining.

328
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:11,931
I'm just...

329
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:15,310
I'm just wondering why you're really here.

330
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:18,646
My way of saying I appreciate you
running that story for my boss.

331
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:20,106
OK.

332
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,316
Hmm.

333
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:22,817
You fucked me to thank me?

334
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,652
Technically,
I went down on you to thank you.

335
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:34,746
I thought you said
this was too complicated,

336
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:36,873
you being a cop and me being a reporter.

337
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:40,668
I guess I like complicated.

338
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,466
Look who's here.

339
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:51,012
Sorry, Astor.
I promise it won't be for long.

340
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:54,474
- It's OK. I get Cody's room.
- Sorry, Cody.

341
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,601
Come on, guys.
It's time to go to school.

342
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:00,188
Check in later.

343
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:10,865
Everything all right
between you and my brother?

344
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,951
We just need to have a talk.

345
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:15,912
It isn't about me staying here, is it?

346
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:18,581
No, you're family.
You're always welcome here.

347
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,667
I'm gonna let you get settled in,

348
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:24,337
and I'm gonna get you some water
for these pain pills, OK?

349
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:30,051
Rita...

350
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,847
Thank you.

351
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:22,312
- Thanks for letting Deb stay with us.
- It was either here... or your apartment.

352
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:24,480
Look, we can't keep putting this off.

353
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:26,858
It's still not a good time.
I need to get to the station.

354
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:31,946
So when do you suppose it'll be
a good time to discuss why you lied to me?

355
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:34,157
I'm really trying here, Dexter.

356
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:36,117
Dexter!

357
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:39,871
I'm just asking for a little patience, all right?
Not for me, but for Deb.

358
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:42,415
Right now I need to focus
on finding who did this.

359
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:47,837
OK.

360
00:25:57,932 --> 00:25:59,307
You didn't come over last night.

361
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:03,519
So little time to sleep lately.
I thought I'd get more rest in my own bed.

362
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:07,899
I'm sorry I went behind your back
to Matthews.

363
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:10,443
It was wrong, and I apologize.

364
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:17,325
If you haven't noticed,
I'm a bit of a control freak.

365
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:20,036
You mean like how like to guard
the remote control with your life?

366
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:23,998
Or how you need to be the first one
in the shower, or how you like to...

367
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:27,377
Look, the reason... I went to the brass

368
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:30,713
was because it'd be one less thing
to worry about ruining what we have.

369
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,591
The only thing
that would ruin what we have...

370
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:35,635
is if we're not honest with each other.

371
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:37,720
No more secrets.

372
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:41,808
No more secrets.

373
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:46,854
Then I'm not going anywhere.

374
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:51,567
That's everything collected
from the parking lot and the hotel rooms

375
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:55,196
- back there on the right.
- Thanks for doing this.

376
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:58,741
My father gave Deb the ring,
and it means the world to her.

377
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,327
I checked the inventories.
Masuka never logged it in.

378
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:04,747
Yeah, Deb doesn't remember
if she was wearing it or not.

379
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:07,125
The shooting has her pretty messed up.

380
00:27:08,002 --> 00:27:11,546
If my coming down here to double-check
helps ease her mind, so be it, right?

381
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:12,839
Yep.

382
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,803
Ah! Fuck. Damn it.

383
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:22,473
- You Morgans and that mouth.
- Do you mind?

384
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:25,727
Oh, yeah. Don't sweat it. There's plenty
more where those come from.

385
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:27,020
Thanks.

386
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:49,834
Here you go.

387
00:27:50,878 --> 00:27:52,420
Guess who just found her ring?

388
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,965
Sorry for the trouble.
Thanks a lot, though.

389
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,258
No problem.

390
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:02,221
- I appreciate the personal tour.
- Any time I can do rounds

391
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:04,807
with a fellow human being is a win.

392
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,518
You're alone every night?

393
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:10,605
Yeah, economy's a bitch.
There used to be two of us on every shift,

394
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:12,565
- but now...
- Oh, say no more.

395
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,525
I'm recently laid off myself.

396
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:18,237
From here on out
I'm gonna be my own boss.

397
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:22,658
Well, there's plenty of office space here.
More tenants means more money,

398
00:28:22,785 --> 00:28:26,371
then maybe I won't have to do double shifts
and I can see my kids once in a while.

399
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:28,206
Oh, you end up setting up shop here,

400
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:32,627
I guarantee this'll be your favorite
destination come lunch time.

401
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:34,879
Right on schedule.
And you brought me a customer.

402
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:38,591
- It's a future renter.
- Well, possible future renter.

403
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:41,636
- Can I get you any?
- No, no.

404
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:46,265
Caffeine makes me a different person.
Appreciate the offer, though.

405
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:51,729
So you say you walk this whole place
every two hours?

406
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:53,648
That's quite a workout.

407
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:57,068
My wife calls it low-impact aerobics
or some shit like that.

408
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:02,824
It takes about 45 minutes,
give or take a smoke break.

409
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,951
Well, we all have our vices.

410
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:09,580
So... how'd you like the building?

411
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:13,042
It's perfect.

412
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,877
Great.

413
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,587
- Thanks a lot.
- Mm-hm.

414
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:27,473
Rita, I think something's
wrong with Harrison.

415
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:31,227
I know that cry.

416
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,273
Someone's wet, isn't he?

417
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:37,358
Good. I thought it was me.

418
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:39,277
Oh, no.

419
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:41,821
No, Harrison loves his Aunt Deb.

420
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:56,377
- Can I ask you something?
- I don't do diapers.

421
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,796
Did Dexter tell you he kept his apartment?

422
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:02,425
What the fuck?

423
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,178
Are you kidding?

424
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:10,141
- He told me he got rid of it.
- Me too.

425
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,395
Just thought he might have...
said something

426
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,189
since you two are so close.

427
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:19,150
Not a word.

428
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:27,783
God, it's like a Morgan family curse
or something.

429
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:30,286
Make the worst choice possible.

430
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,669
At least Dexter's don't get people killed.

431
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:42,215
You think you're responsible
for Lundy's death?

432
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:46,719
He never would have been anywhere
near that parking lot if it weren't for me.

433
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,389
Is that why your pain pills are in the trash?

434
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,683
To punish yourself?

435
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:58,189
What happened to Lundy isn't your fault.
You had no control over it.

436
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:03,319
This isn't about... choices
or even about you.

437
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:07,240
Sometimes bad things just happen.

438
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,747
That's the answer to this?

439
00:31:18,252 --> 00:31:20,378
Bad things happen?

440
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:22,380
Life happens.

441
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:29,804
I've yet to find Trinity's
signature at any of his crime scenes.

442
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:34,308
Trinity moves from state to state.

443
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:38,229
Law enforcement never links his kill cycles
to one another.

444
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:41,983
Over 30 years of killing.

445
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:44,485
The cycle, the ritual -

446
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:48,656
they tell me where Trinity will be,
but I have to know who I'm looking for.

447
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:50,324
I have to be sure.

448
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:53,411
Lobby's open 24 hours.

449
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:55,663
Guard on duty.
Too much foot traffic.

450
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:59,333
- Trinity'd have to choose another floor...
- Ooh! Sorry.

451
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:03,296
Bus number 432.

452
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:09,176
Male. Maybe 6'4". 190 to 200 pounds.

453
00:32:09,303 --> 00:32:10,845
Age - around 60.

454
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:12,388
Hair - gray.

455
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:14,348
Eyes - blue.

456
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:17,518
Something in them.

457
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,521
Lundy saw a ghost.

458
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:26,193
OK, listen up, everyone.

459
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,279
I just got word
there was a shooting at a motel.

460
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:30,740
You all need to get there
as soon as possible, guys.

461
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:33,492
Quinn's already en route.
Angel, you're with me.

462
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:35,411
Masuka, grab your stuff.

463
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,414
- What's going on?
- Motel shooting.

464
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,207
Body's a match for Johnny Rose.

465
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:43,753
- I'm going with you.
- You can't work this. You're next of kin.

466
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:45,379
I've got it.

467
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:48,382
Let's just hope Deb
is finally gonna get some justice.

468
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:50,217
That's the plan.

469
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:58,809
Karma - what a fuckin' concept.

470
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:04,732
Uno, dos, tres.

471
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:06,942
The first bullet didn't quite make her point.

472
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:09,403
We've got Nikki Wald cornered

473
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,072
in the alley behind Al's Liquor Store.

474
00:33:11,198 --> 00:33:12,406
Let's go.

475
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:17,870
Prick!
Son of a bitch!

476
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:28,881
What do we got?

477
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,384
Found her in the alley.
Altered, agitated.

478
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,886
Every time we get near,
the gun goes up.

479
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,388
- We good?
- Yeah.

480
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:38,307
Why? Why?

481
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:43,479
- Nikki!
- Damn it!

482
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:47,608
He fuckin'...
He fuckin' cheated on me!

483
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:49,402
We need you to put the gun down!

484
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:52,530
He ruined everything!

485
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:55,449
You fuckin' ruined everything!

486
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:58,619
She's wasted.
She doesn't even know where she is.

487
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,037
Cover us.

488
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:06,585
Nikki! No one's gonna hurt you.
We just want to talk.

489
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:09,588
The alley's sealed off.
You can't go anywhere.

490
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:12,466
Did you hear that, Johnny?
What about the boat?

491
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:14,844
What about Bermuda, Johnny?
Wasn't that the plan?

492
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,929
You piece of shit!

493
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,973
Aargh!

494
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:23,310
We got 'em, Morgan.

495
00:34:23,437 --> 00:34:25,312
- Got who?
- Nikki Wald and Johnny Rose.

496
00:34:25,439 --> 00:34:27,314
Well, we got Nikki.
Johnny's on his way to the morgue.

497
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:30,818
- What happened?
- She fuckin' shot him. Long story. Look...

498
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:34,155
I know this doesn't change what happened,
but hopefully you'll find some peace of mind

499
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:38,826
- knowing this thing's over.
- Yeah. Peace of mind.

500
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:42,580
I gotta take this skank down to Booking.
Congratulations, partner.

501
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,004
Such a waste.

502
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:54,049
Lundy, those other tourists.
For what? A boat to Bermuda?

503
00:34:54,176 --> 00:34:57,052
Hell hath no fury
like a meth addict scorned.

504
00:34:57,179 --> 00:34:58,679
Your office, Lieutenant.

505
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:03,184
- Was... Was that a smile?
- I don't know.

506
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:12,651
Congratulations, Maria. That was
really good police work out there today.

507
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:13,944
Thanks.

508
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:18,365
But it was Sergeant Batista's
good police work.

509
00:35:18,492 --> 00:35:20,201
Yes.

510
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:23,788
Well...
I know he's an asset to your team,

511
00:35:23,914 --> 00:35:26,415
but this department can't risk
a defense attorney

512
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:29,084
turning your romantic involvement
into a courtroom sideshow

513
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:31,212
- every time you work a case together.
- What are you saying?

514
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:36,008
I am saying I need you to transfer
Sergeant Batista out of Homicide.

515
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:39,011
Tom... this is bullshit!

516
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:43,682
We followed protocol.
Christ, he made this bust.

517
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:47,269
Which is why I'm going to make sure
that Sergeant Batista gets a promotion

518
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,979
along with his transfer.

519
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:53,734
Have the papers on my desk by Monday.

520
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:56,278
Sergeant.

521
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,078
Fuck. What is it?

522
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:09,041
While everyone's chasing their tails
over Nikki Wald,

523
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,418
I'm going after the man
who really shot my sister.

524
00:36:11,545 --> 00:36:15,714
In a few hours, the enigma that is Trinity
will be on my table.

525
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:17,675
A riddle wrapped in plastic.

526
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:23,222
- Morgan.
- I need to see you.

527
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:25,599
I'm kinda in the middle of something.

528
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:27,309
- Can it wait?
- No.

529
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:30,145
Well, I'm way over
on the other side of town.

530
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:33,899
- It'll take me at least an hour to get there.
- I'm not home.

531
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:37,027
I'm where Frank was shot.

532
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:49,748
You can't even see our blood.

533
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:52,585
It's like it never happened.

534
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:59,008
- Deb?
- What the fuck's your problem?

535
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,468
I got here as fast as I could.

536
00:37:01,595 --> 00:37:05,681
You have everything, and you're doing
your goddamn best to throw it all away.

537
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:15,232
- Rita told you about the apartment.
- What the fuck were you thinking?

538
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:17,109
You have to make this right.

539
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:24,491
- I'm not sure I know how.
- Then figure it out.

540
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:30,039
- I'm the fuck-up in the family, not you.
- Don't say that.

541
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:32,124
You have a choice.

542
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:35,878
To be a good husband,
to be a good father.

543
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:37,212
I know.

544
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:39,965
It's just, uh...

545
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:45,888
Sometimes I feel trapped.

546
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:49,725
By what?

547
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:53,437
Great kids?

548
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:55,397
A wife who adores you?

549
00:37:56,399 --> 00:38:00,611
Yesterday... I had Lundy and Anton.

550
00:38:04,658 --> 00:38:06,700
And now they're gone because of me.

551
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,911
You didn't do anything wrong.

552
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,542
It doesn't matter what I do...

553
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,587
or what I choose.

554
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:22,132
I'm what's wrong.

555
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:26,136
There's nothing I can do about it.

556
00:38:28,098 --> 00:38:31,892
If I'm not hurting myself,
I'm hurting everyone around me.

557
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:33,686
There's nothing I can do about it.

558
00:38:34,688 --> 00:38:35,771
I'm...

559
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:37,648
I'm broken!

560
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:38,899
I'm...

561
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,442
No, you're not.

562
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,156
I am.

563
00:38:57,627 --> 00:39:00,796
- Why don't we go back to the house?
- Don't! Don't.

564
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:05,050
I need to be here.

565
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:09,638
Where Lundy died!

566
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:14,059
I can't do a fucking thing about it!

567
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:31,869
My sister doesn't deserve
to be in this kind of pain.

568
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:34,955
But I know who does.

569
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:40,627
Trinity hurt my sister
and I'm going to hurt him back,

570
00:39:40,754 --> 00:39:42,254
and it's going to feel...

571
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:44,757
Uh-oh.

572
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,135
Your manager let me in.

573
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:51,013
He had no idea we were married.

574
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:56,560
Funny thing is,
I'm beginning to wonder myself.

575
00:39:57,437 --> 00:39:58,979
Rita, you're upset.

576
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:04,568
I actually convinced myself that
by coming here this would all make sense.

577
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:08,530
Why it was so important
that you keep this place a secret.

578
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:17,164
As I was coming over here,
all I could think about...

579
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:19,500
that you were using drugs again...

580
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:24,338
- that you were having an affair again.
- That will never happen.

581
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:28,092
I went through your cabinets,
rifled through your desk...

582
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:33,806
looking for anything that would explain

583
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:36,308
what would be so horrible

584
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:39,978
that my husband would have
to keep a place to hide it from me

585
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:41,605
or his own sister.

586
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:42,940
And?

587
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:47,152
I was gonna break the lock,
but I was too scared of what I might find.

588
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:49,613
And you know why?

589
00:40:50,824 --> 00:40:52,991
'Cause you put me in this position, Dexter.

590
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:57,329
This is not the type of person or wife
that I want to be.

591
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,965
You really want to know what's inside?

592
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:09,883
Yes.

593
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:31,780
It was Harry's.

594
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:40,664
I wasn't comfortable having it in the house
with the kids, so I kept it here.

595
00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:48,839
See? I have nothing to hide.

596
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:52,384
Except for the syringes,
scalpels, and bone saw

597
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,761
hidden in that secret drawer underneath.

598
00:41:54,888 --> 00:41:56,555
Nothing to hide?

599
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:00,392
Like your car accident
and your concussion and this apartment?

600
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:05,564
The most disturbing thing
about your lying is that...

601
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:10,903
I'm beginning to see
just how good you really are at it.

602
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:14,615
You should sleep here tonight.

603
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:16,241
When you're ready to come home,

604
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:19,494
we have a lot of work to do
if this marriage has any hope.

605
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:39,598
- Hey. Pulling an all-nighter?
- Yep. No rest for the wicked.

606
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:41,725
- Have a good one.
- Always do.

607
00:42:56,324 --> 00:43:01,161
It's almost poetic - one serial killer
ending the 30-year reign of another.

608
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:03,330
Trinity could be anywhere in this building.

609
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:06,625
I've gotta get to the
security surveillance room.

610
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:10,879
Hm. Where's that security guard?

611
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:13,006
He was here last night.

612
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:27,521
I've been so focused on Trinity,
I've neglected who his victim might be.

613
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:31,275
The bludgeoning victim 30 years ago,
didn't he have two kids?

614
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,194
It's the security guard.

615
00:43:50,503 --> 00:43:51,878
If he's here...

616
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:54,214
Then where's Trinity?

617
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:56,091
Aargh!

618
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:17,237
Take the bait. Take the bait.

619
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:27,873
Oh, no! Please!

620
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:30,167
I'm a father!

621
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:35,756
- You were no father.
- Aargh!

622
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:39,968
- Aargh!
- You made me...

623
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:43,722
You made me...

624
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:48,643
The recording disc is gone.

625
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:52,731
Where are you, Trinity?

626
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:01,990
Oh, my God.

627
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:06,620
You made me do this!

628
00:45:13,586 --> 00:45:14,753
Trinity.

629
00:45:32,188 --> 00:45:33,313
Shit.

630
00:45:41,197 --> 00:45:44,825
The elevators aren't moving.
He's using the stairs.

631
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:47,994
Which one?

632
00:45:48,121 --> 00:45:51,289
I can't risk picking the wrong exit
and miss Trinity.

633
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:53,208
His car has to be here.

634
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:32,706
No way I lose you again, Trinity.

635
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:40,130
The Miami nobody sees.

636
00:46:40,256 --> 00:46:43,758
He's scurrying back
to whatever hole he crawled out of.

637
00:46:45,303 --> 00:46:47,179
The lone wolf thinks this is over.

638
00:46:56,022 --> 00:46:57,731
Asshole!

639
00:46:57,857 --> 00:46:59,983
What the hell's he doing?

640
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,655
Where are you going, Trinity?

641
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:12,245
Stay with him.

642
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:14,164
He's not getting away.

643
00:47:22,298 --> 00:47:24,341
He doesn't belong here.
It doesn't make sense.

644
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:41,441
Hi, honey.

645
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:44,611
Mmm. Missed you.

646
00:47:47,949 --> 00:47:49,282
Hey, kids!

647
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:51,493
Daddy!

648
00:47:52,537 --> 00:47:53,537
Hey, Dad!

649
00:47:53,663 --> 00:47:55,080
Lundy was wrong.

650
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:56,957
I was wrong.

651
00:47:57,083 --> 00:47:59,709
Neither of us knew pieces of the puzzle
were missing.

652
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:02,003
Trinity's a husband...

653
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:04,339
a father.

654
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:08,176
He's...

655
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:10,679
like me.
