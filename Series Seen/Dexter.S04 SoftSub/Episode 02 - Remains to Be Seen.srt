1
00:00:02,044 --> 00:00:03,670
Previously on Dexter.

2
00:00:03,796 --> 00:00:05,046
Dexter Morgan.

3
00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:06,756
Good suburban husband.

4
00:00:06,882 --> 00:00:08,591
Happy father of three.

5
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:10,301
Living the dream.

6
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:12,095
Want to know a secret?

7
00:00:12,221 --> 00:00:14,305
Daddy kills people.

8
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:18,434
I'm halfway through
the CI files you gave me.

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,978
Maybe then I'll finally
get some answers.

10
00:00:22,398 --> 00:00:25,400
- Tell me again this isn't crazy.
- Crazy good.

11
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:28,945
Some guy on his honeymoon
took a shot in the head.

12
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:31,447
Grave condition.
They're pulling the plug tomorrow.

13
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,408
Last thing our city needs
is dead tourists.

14
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:35,368
Brought you a copy of my article.

15
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:37,870
My editor OK'd a follow-up.
You got anything for me?

16
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:40,415
I'd love to take you out for a drink.

17
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,250
Let's make it dinner.

18
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,463
Dexter.

19
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:50,133
How's my favorite serial killer hunter?

20
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:54,137
- Are you here on a case?
- Actually I'm retired now.

21
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:57,974
Now I have the time to track down
the one twisted son of a bitch who got away.

22
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:02,478
So who is the twisted son of a bitch?

23
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:06,315
I call him the Trinity Killer.
Kills in threes.

24
00:01:06,442 --> 00:01:08,776
Been doing it all over
the country for years.

25
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,945
Trinity's in Miami, Dexter,

26
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,030
starting his cycle all over again.

27
00:01:13,157 --> 00:01:16,993
Vicky Noonan, 22,
found in the bathtub.

28
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,870
1979?

29
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:20,496
But this is the Gomez hearing.

30
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:21,998
Yes, Mr. Morgan.

31
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:25,877
- The defendant's name is Benito Gomez.
- I must've brought the wrong notes.

32
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:28,004
- Wrong notes, wrong blood type...
- Oh, fuck.

33
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,674
...wrong case. That's what you call
a momentary mix-up in a murder trial?

34
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,676
That asshole you let walk?

35
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:36,637
- Benito Gomez.
- Ah, now you get it right.

36
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:40,016
Quinn's legwork may have shown me
where to find our friend,

37
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:41,517
but this, Benny -

38
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:44,979
my bloodwork is the stuff
that seals your fate.

39
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:47,857
- The fuck you want?
- You.

40
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:50,109
Shut down for decades.
Way out of town.

41
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:52,528
A fitting place for a punk
like Benny Gomez

42
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:55,239
to go down for the count.

43
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:04,040
Tonight's the night I finally...

44
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:05,917
sleep.

45
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:08,664
Hang in there, buddy. We got you.

46
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,334
Do you know where you are?

47
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,379
- Ambulance. What happened?
- You were in an accident.

48
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:01,425
Benny. Benny. Benny.

49
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:16,941
Sir, we found something in your car.

50
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:21,195
Benny Gomez is in there.

51
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,365
- You're OK.
- A bag.

52
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:27,994
Says, uh, "pediatric" on it.

53
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,288
Thought you might need
to take it with you.

54
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:36,293
- Where are they taking my car?
- Just relax. They'll take care of it.

55
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,713
I have no idea where it's going.

56
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:39,755
If someone...

57
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,425
When someone finds
what's in back...

58
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,594
It's never as bad as it looks.

59
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:47,763
Oh, I'm pretty sure this is worse.

60
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,857
- What's your name?
- Dexter Morgan.

61
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:00,109
You know who the president is?

62
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:01,652
Barack Obama.

63
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:06,115
Your pupils are dilating normally,
which is the good news.

64
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:08,784
Bad news is that you've
sustained a concussion.

65
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,120
What's the last thing
you remember?

66
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,458
Working late.

67
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,335
My wife...

68
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:20,963
asked me to pick up some
medicine for our son.

69
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,882
He's been sick.

70
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:25,801
I haven't been sleeping well.
I must have dozed off at the wheel.

71
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,971
- So you don't remember the accident?
- No.

72
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,182
I don't even remember getting
in the car.

73
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:34,268
Short-term memory loss is common
for this type of injury.

74
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,980
Can also affect your judgment,
cause confusion, disorientation.

75
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,066
I just need a good night's sleep, I think.

76
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:41,776
Not for the next 12 hours.

77
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:44,987
Any type of head trauma,
we want to keep the patient awake.

78
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,614
I'd like to keep you here
for observation.

79
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,699
- Not an option.
- Mmm.

80
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,452
My wife's a registered nurse.
She'll keep an eye on me.

81
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:54,663
You got whacked pretty good, Mr. Morgan.
You need to be monitored.

82
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,792
I'll get your admission paperwork going.
Be right back.

83
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,756
Dexter! Oh, my God!

84
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:05,549
Are you all right?

85
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,676
I'm fine. It's just a little fender bender.

86
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:10,596
The nurse said they brought you
in an ambulance. An ambulance, Dexter.

87
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:14,183
No, it's just a liability thing.
Doc says I'm good to go.

88
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:17,686
I raced over here. Look at me.

89
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:20,022
I'm wearing two different shoes.

90
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,650
Sure you're OK? You look so pale.

91
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,485
Hospitals.

92
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,905
They give me the creeps,
which is why I want to get out of here.

93
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,324
I was so scared.

94
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,829
It's OK. I'm fine.

95
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,206
Come on. Let's go.

96
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:40,000
I got to get ready for work.

97
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:43,045
Aspirin, caffeine,
whatever it takes.

98
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,256
If I fall asleep, it's over.

99
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:46,632
And I'm not talking concussion.

100
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:50,219
If they find Benny in my car,
it's lethal injection time.

101
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:53,722
Cody, you butt-breath,
stay away from my stuff!

102
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:57,393
If ever there was a reason
to take a personal day, this is it.

103
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,853
I'm OK.

104
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,896
But I love having someone
to worry about me.

105
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,858
Good, 'cause that's exactly
what I'm doing.

106
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,070
- Who else needs a kiss?
- I'm good.

107
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,822
How about a hug?

108
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,993
- Oh!
- What's the matter?

109
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,829
Uh, just a little sore
from the accident still.

110
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,831
You got in an accident?

111
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,166
Anyone die?

112
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:23,836
Just a little fender bender.
No one died.

113
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:26,922
There's my cab.

114
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,424
Dexter, why can't you just call in?

115
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,426
And what? Take a vacation day?

116
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:32,887
I'd rather do that
when we can all go to Disney World.

117
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,221
Disney World!

118
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:37,933
I'm fine.

119
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,727
I gotta go to work.

120
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:44,607
And I need one slow day at the job
where nobody gets murdered.

121
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,276
I already have a killer
to clean up after.

122
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:49,320
Me.

123
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:51,614
Hay café con leche in the kitchen.

124
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,073
I'll grab some at work.

125
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,951
Got to make sure to get there
before you do.

126
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,329
Don't want to arouse suspicion.

127
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,664
Mmm.

128
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,001
Speaking of arousing...

129
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,798
You keep this up,
there goes your head start.

130
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,511
What if we showed up together, hmm?

131
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:16,764
What's the worst
that could happen?

132
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:22,478
Better get to the station.

133
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:25,314
Yeah, I should get in the shower.

134
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,484
- You've got a ten-minute head start.
- Make it 20 just to be safe.

135
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,361
You should...

136
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:33,030
...leave your hair down.

137
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,200
It's beautiful.

138
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,584
Yes, Ray's Tow Yard, 15th, right?

139
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,801
Dexter?

140
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,261
Car trouble?

141
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:57,179
Uh, little accident.

142
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,014
It's my fault. I'm a knucklehead.

143
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,726
You got a minute?
I'd like to pick your brain.

144
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,731
I need to get over
to the motor pool

145
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,651
before they run out of loaners,
there's something I need to pick up.

146
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,528
Not a problem. I'll walk with you.

147
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:14,113
Uh...

148
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,031
Yeah, I do have a minute.

149
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:20,869
Just want to follow up on that crime scene
investigation from the other day.

150
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:22,162
Lisa Bell?

151
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:23,706
Lisa Bell?

152
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:25,457
The girl in the bathtub.

153
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,501
Right! Uh... of course.

154
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,670
The Trinity Killer's
most recent victim.

155
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,797
If my theory holds.

156
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:34,174
You sure you're OK?

157
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:36,885
I'm just, uh, tired. Long night.

158
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:38,971
What can I tell you
about Lisa Bell?

159
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:42,224
You run across any hair or fiber
in that second blood sample you found?

160
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,560
Nothing yet.

161
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:47,521
Really is kismet, you know?

162
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,274
- Kismet?
- Fate.

163
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,735
I mean, if Trinity had struck
in Buffalo instead of Miami,

164
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:56,697
I wouldn't have access
to a blood guy of your caliber.

165
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,742
Well, thanks... for that.

166
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,952
But the person that you should
really be talking to is my sister.

167
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,412
She's lead on Lisa Bell.

168
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:07,541
See? Already putting
good ideas in my head.

169
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,751
Kismet.

170
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:13,797
More like self-preservation.

171
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:16,258
Last thing I need right now
is Frank Lundy,

172
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,093
rock star FBI profiler,

173
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,387
standing between me
and Benny Gomez.

174
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:17,319
No crime scene tape, no coroner's van.
That bodes well.

175
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:23,367
Unless SWAT's lying in wait for me.

176
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,914
Ah!

177
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,835
The bag's still there.

178
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:36,338
Wait, a bag.
Not the six it takes to hold a body.

179
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,719
My kill tools.

180
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:46,640
If they're here and Benny isn't,
he must have been thrown from the car.

181
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:51,895
I have to get to the crash site.

182
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,025
Shit!

183
00:12:57,819 --> 00:12:59,236
Shit!

184
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:00,446
Morgan.

185
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:03,866
Dexter, I need you at a crime scene.
Someone found the body.

186
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:06,535
Oh, you make it sound so easy.

187
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:08,162
Vizcaya Reef Hotel.

188
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:11,707
Just one murder-free day, Miami.
That's all I asked for.

189
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,041
On my way.

190
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:15,961
OK, I need you there ASAP.
This is high priority.

191
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:18,964
One stop first. Higher priority.

192
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:24,636
If that one stop doesn't
give me Benny Gomez,

193
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,473
I'll be running out of options.

194
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:30,559
All right, let's get moving.
Yale, Soderquist, Morgan, Quinn.

195
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:33,395
Sarge, I'm working a lead on
the Lisa Bell case. I have to...

196
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,731
- Where the hell's Quinn?
- Here. I'm here.

197
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:37,357
Not for long.

198
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,485
Another tourist caught a bullet.

199
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:41,820
You do what you have
to do with the Bell case, but check in,

200
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,405
- we may need you at the hotel.
- OK.

201
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,699
- You came up with something on our case?
- Yeah. Yeah.

202
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,869
While you were looking for your panties
on some chickie-do's floor.

203
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,997
Frances, hey. Deb.

204
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:53,332
Were you able to pull anything up

205
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,043
on that 30-year-old homicide
I was asking you about?

206
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,086
Perp's name's Eddie Noonan.

207
00:13:58,213 --> 00:14:00,047
Great. Can you bring it up?

208
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,548
Thanks.

209
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,843
My keen forensic
sense of smell

210
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,887
tells me you're wearing
new perfume.

211
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:12,809
Anything to do with the return
of one Special Agent Frank Lundy?

212
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:14,269
I already have a boyfriend

213
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,772
who happens to be coming
back in town tonight.

214
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:19,691
And if you smell me again,
I'll punch you in the throat.

215
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:24,196
So much for keeping these
shootings low profile.

216
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:28,742
"A string of robberies turned deadly
in what authorities are now calling

217
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,077
"'the Vacation Murder'."

218
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,955
Imagine how thrilled the mayor
is this thing had a brand name.

219
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:35,374
Wait till he hears it's
Vacations Murders, plural.

220
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,416
Jesus.

221
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,670
Does anyone know this... Christine Hill?

222
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,299
We might have met a few times.

223
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,177
Well, see if you can get her to tone down
the creative writing, OK?

224
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,471
I'm gonna need an arrest here soon.

225
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,890
- Don't worry, I'm on it.
- Actually, I'm on it.

226
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,768
I told the mayor
I'd take lead on this case.

227
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:59,314
- OK.
- No reflection on you, Sergeant.

228
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,441
It's your call, Lieutenant.

229
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:05,821
You are so boning this reporter.

230
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:07,364
Shut the fuck up.

231
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,367
Guys, vámonos,
we got a crime to solve.

232
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:24,506
You here to lend a hand?

233
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,675
More like find one.

234
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:29,094
If those body parts
were thrown from the car,

235
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,638
- locating them is a matter of...
- Velocity and trajectory.

236
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:36,184
Should be right around here.

237
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:46,528
- Just imagine if Harrison had been...
- He wasn't.

238
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,990
If your ritual hadn't been interrupted
to go pick up meds for Harrison...

239
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:53,160
- You saying he's to blame for this?
- I'm not.

240
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,127
Dizzy?

241
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,380
I'm fine.

242
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,466
Unless you can't find Benny Gomez.

243
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,719
Those bags aren't here, Dexter.

244
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,221
What did you do with his body?

245
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:16,099
Rita called about Harrison and...

246
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:19,686
...everything else is just fog.

247
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,065
Come on, Dex. Think.

248
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,821
Where is Benny?

249
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,866
I don't know.

250
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:43,543
Fucking dead people.

251
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:48,882
Everything we've got on Noonan's
1979 homicide conviction.

252
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,051
Evidence logs,
witness statements.

253
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,427
Plea agreements in there too.

254
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,137
- Frances...
- Mmm?

255
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:57,891
If I hadn't already gone through
that phase in college, I'd kiss you.

256
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,228
So why are you interested in a murder
that happened while you were in diapers?

257
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:04,898
A guy kills his wife while
she's taking a bath 30 years ago.

258
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:08,235
We found a new victim a few days ago
at, get this, his old address.

259
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,112
A coincidence? I think fucking not.

260
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:11,905
You forgetting something?

261
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,367
Your father's old confidential informant
folders aren't gonna re-file themselves.

262
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:16,493
Sorry.

263
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:19,121
Susannah Coffey.
Another blast from the past.

264
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:20,497
Hmm, was she at least useful?

265
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,457
Only as a reminder to wear sunblock.

266
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:26,128
But I'm still waiting on a few callbacks
from some other names on the list,

267
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:28,088
but so far, I'm starting to think

268
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,716
maybe I fucked around more
than my old man did.

269
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:34,761
Just work the scene. Don't raise flags.

270
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,555
Just work the scene...

271
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:39,641
then get the hell
to the boxing arena.

272
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:45,480
Get those news trucks out of here.
I got a coroner's van coming through.

273
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,023
Copy that.

274
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:53,155
- Hey, Joey.
- This is an active crime scene, ma'am.

275
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:55,198
I'm gonna need you behind that tape.

276
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,451
"Ma'am"?

277
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,077
Your article, "Vacation Murder"?

278
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,871
"Murders" now, it seems.

279
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:03,331
See, how am I supposed to talk to you
when I got to watch everything I say?

280
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:06,585
Which means you do still
want to talk to me?

281
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:10,672
Yeah, I do.

282
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,300
Good. 'Cause I like talking to you.

283
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,260
Amongst other things.

284
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:20,307
Those things are good,
but we got to have some ground rules.

285
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:27,689
Quinn, I need you to run an inventory
on the victim's personal effects.

286
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,524
I'm on it, boss.

287
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:32,319
Stay back here, ma'am. You know better.

288
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:37,032
Your timing sucks.

289
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:38,700
What have we got here?

290
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,994
Shot from behind as he was
coming in the room.

291
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,996
Caught a medium-caliber bullet
in the back of the neck.

292
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,791
Empty wallet, watch missing,
drawer's empty.

293
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:49,127
Someone figured out it's easier to rob
people who are dead first.

294
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:53,215
Directional swipe pattern of one of the
assailant's shoes shows he went that way.

295
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:56,593
OK, Angel, start a canvass.
Guests, employees, security cameras.

296
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:59,471
- Already handled.
- Next of kin will have to be notified.

297
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:01,556
Got it, if you're good with that,
Lieutenant.

298
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,600
You got your hands full here.
I'll deal with it.

299
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:07,938
What's up with the boss lady
taking lead on your case?

300
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:09,898
Chain of command is there
for a reason, Vince.

301
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:11,525
Just do your goddamn job.

302
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:16,029
Dude, your gills are green.
You gonna blow?

303
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,365
Uh, I need to get some air.

304
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,164
Don't have time for this.

305
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:31,878
Oh.

306
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,215
Are we blood?

307
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:45,559
Join you?

308
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:51,314
One o'clock. Some things...

309
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,275
Holy-what-the-fuck is that?

310
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:54,359
Sushi.

311
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:56,903
What happened
to the daily cucumber sammy?

312
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,447
It retire along with the rest of you?

313
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:03,743
All that cream cheese
wasn't exactly helping my cholesterol.

314
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:06,955
I'm sorry.
This is too fucking weird.

315
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:09,207
I can get a sandwich if it makes you
more comfortable.

316
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,459
No, it's...

317
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:13,545
...this.

318
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:15,630
Us.

319
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,924
I haven't seen you, spoken to you,

320
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,010
or exchanged so much as
a fucking Christmas card

321
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:21,928
with you in two years.

322
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,722
Now all of a sudden
you're in Miami

323
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:25,599
holding a pair of chopsticks
without so much

324
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,893
as an email saying,
"Hey, remember me?

325
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:31,438
"We used to fuck. I'm coming to town.
You want to grab lunch?"

326
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:34,024
I mean, seriously. What the fuck?

327
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,818
I know. Same old mouth.

328
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:41,156
- Not without its charm.
- Really?

329
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:43,199
That's all you have to say to me?

330
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,622
I should have let you know
I was coming to Miami.

331
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:52,000
This task force they're trying
to put together is hush-hush.

332
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:54,252
Plus I knew you'd be busy,

333
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,087
what with making detective and all.

334
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,924
Yeah, well, tell me about it.

335
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,759
I have a suspect en route.

336
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:02,594
The Lisa Bell case?

337
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,013
What do you know about Lisa Bell?

338
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:07,265
Only what your brother's told me.

339
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:13,521
Well, check this, she brags.

340
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:15,482
We found another murder.

341
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:16,650
30 years old.

342
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:19,986
Same MO, same address,
same fucking bathtub.

343
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,030
A guy was convicted.
He's back out in the world.

344
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:25,408
So how do I not like him
for slicing up Lisa Bell?

345
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,494
Sounds like he deserves
a good hard look.

346
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,663
I had Patrol pick him up.

347
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,206
Should be here any minute.

348
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:33,124
Mind if I tag along?

349
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:35,794
To the interview?

350
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,089
I'd like to see Detective Morgan
in all her glory.

351
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,051
Sounds like someone's bored
with retirement already.

352
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:47,097
Here you go. Thanks very much.
Keep the change.

353
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:49,808
Come on, guys. Come on, boys.

354
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,739
Oh, sorry, sir.

355
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,408
It was an accident.

356
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:07,909
It's OK, kiddo.

357
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:10,996
It happens.
What is that, strawberry?

358
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:12,539
Uh, bubblegum gelato.

359
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:16,292
How, uh... repulsive.

360
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:22,424
You better catch up with your mom.

361
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:26,803
You don't want to lose her.

362
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,436
Just had to find blood, didn't you?

363
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,148
It is my job.

364
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:40,025
And you've got a family to support

365
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:42,068
and people to dismember.

366
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,737
You're spinning too many plates, Dexter.

367
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:47,115
The sooner I wrap this up,
the sooner I get to the boxing arena.

368
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:48,575
You might want to give some thought

369
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:51,244
as to what happens
when somebody else finds that body.

370
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:57,792
Manager's on his way to open the safe.

371
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,836
What's the date of birth
on his passport?

372
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:01,796
5/5/72.

373
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,602
Jeez.

374
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:37,916
Don't sweat it, Quinn.

375
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:40,668
I've got much bigger things
to worry about.

376
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:42,670
I filled in the lieutenant
on what we found.

377
00:23:42,797 --> 00:23:44,756
We?

378
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:46,925
Dude, there's no "me" in "team".

379
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:49,427
Well, technically there is, but...

380
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:52,097
Blood deposit on the yucca
on the assailant's escape route.

381
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:54,891
- He probably scraped himself.
- Does that mean we have his DNA?

382
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:57,018
I'll run it through the database
soon as I get back to the lab.

383
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,186
Go.

384
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:00,021
You, come with me.

385
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,650
I'm going, just not where you think.

386
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:07,821
You were convicted of killing
your wife back in '79.

387
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:11,491
Sliced open her femoral artery.
She bled to death in your bathtub.

388
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:13,701
Do I need to talk to a lawyer?

389
00:24:13,828 --> 00:24:17,122
At this point, we're interviewing you
to get more or less an expert opinion.

390
00:24:17,248 --> 00:24:19,040
See, your case bears
an uncanny resemblance

391
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,917
to a case we're working on now.

392
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:24,671
Same MO à la that femoral artery.

393
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:26,089
Same house.

394
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:28,049
Same everything.

395
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:30,135
No fucking way.

396
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:32,512
Yes fucking way.

397
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:35,348
Sort of puts you at number one,
person-of-interest-wise.

398
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,559
- I didn't kill my wife.
- Oh, no?

399
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:40,728
You're just another innocent man
behind bars for no good reason.

400
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:44,232
The fucking deck was stacked
before I walked into that courtroom

401
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:46,234
in a death penalty state.

402
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,404
You copped to doing the deed.
You took the deal.

403
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,072
I did my time and I moved on.

404
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:54,242
- You moved on to Lisa Bell.
- Who is Lisa Bell?

405
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:58,121
The young lady that you killed
last Monday night in your old house.

406
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:01,916
Whatever sick fucking poetry
you find in that.

407
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,504
Tell us what you did, Mr. Noonan.

408
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:12,552
It was muggy for so late at night.

409
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:16,806
And Vicky, my wife...

410
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:19,684
wanted to cool off
in the tub, so...

411
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:25,023
I went out to score some shit
and I came back.

412
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,651
And I found her.

413
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,744
I wish I could buy the tears. I just...

414
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,205
I can't get there.

415
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:44,459
Monday night I was working a swing shift
at the homeless shelter in Allapattah

416
00:25:44,585 --> 00:25:47,962
hosing piss off the sidewalk
from the folks waiting to get inside

417
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:50,590
until 8:00-fucking-a. m.

418
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:56,221
We'll call the homeless shelter.
Verify your story.

419
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:05,271
One, the guy's a train wreck.

420
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,815
Two, he's a total slob,
he smells like a sewer,

421
00:26:07,942 --> 00:26:10,485
- and his fingernails are disgusting.
- Our killer's meticulous.

422
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:12,487
Zero DNA left at the crime scene.

423
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:13,947
Obviously you caught
his case of the shakes.

424
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:16,324
Given his rehab history,
I'm voting DT's.

425
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,326
And Lisa Bell was cut
with surgical precision.

426
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:20,828
So, Detective Morgan...

427
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:25,458
- are we in agreement here?
- Violent agreement...

428
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,669
Retired Special Agent Lundy.

429
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:30,421
If Noonan didn't kill Lisa Bell,

430
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,507
why is the MO the same
as his wife's murder?

431
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:35,468
- Copycat?
- Of an obscure 30-year-old crime?

432
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:38,513
Do we think Noonan's
telling the truth...

433
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:40,348
that he didn't kill his wife?

434
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:42,850
- I believe we do.
- Shit.

435
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:45,895
I have a theory I'd like to run by you.

436
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:51,776
We could grab dinner, review the case,
maybe catch a bad guy.

437
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:54,570
I... Uh...

438
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:58,866
Su... OK, I guess.

439
00:26:58,993 --> 00:27:03,454
Um, I've got to cut Noonan loose
and make sure he talks to a lawyer.

440
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,791
If our side railroaded him
into that plea bargain,

441
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:09,210
he could have one fuck mother
of a case.

442
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,796
You have a good heart, Debra.

443
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:13,298
Pick you up around 8:00?

444
00:27:13,424 --> 00:27:15,174
Yeah, so I'll...

445
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:19,929
Yes. Yes.

446
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,377
The boxing arena's
at the next off-ramp,

447
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:55,089
but I still have miles
to go before I sleep.

448
00:28:00,054 --> 00:28:02,722
Bits and pieces.

449
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:05,600
Memory fragments.

450
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:07,643
All I have from last night.

451
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:27,330
Looks like I got the job done.

452
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:30,750
Almost.

453
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,711
Blood.

454
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:37,173
I was off my game.

455
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:40,802
Sloppy.

456
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:45,181
With Harry's code ingrained in me,
cleaning a kill room should be automatic.

457
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:49,811
The code. Etched into my memory
to ensure survival.

458
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:53,564
What would I do if I couldn't
properly dispose of a body?

459
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,525
I'd hide it.

460
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:02,448
I investigate crime scenes
all the time.

461
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:06,702
But this one...

462
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:08,621
my crime scene...

463
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:12,458
it's giving me nothing.

464
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:17,380
Damn it.

465
00:29:18,132 --> 00:29:20,508
Focus. Track it.

466
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:22,635
Where did I go from here?

467
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,762
The pharmacy.

468
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:28,683
Harrison's earache medicine.

469
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:31,561
The only stop I made
before the crash.

470
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,608
The only stop I remember.

471
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:56,294
If you thought you were coming right back,
not a bad hiding place.

472
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,463
Why are you wearing those?

473
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:01,299
This is the way I was dressed
the first time we met.

474
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:05,553
Your mother's murder was the last time
your memory was a blank.

475
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:06,846
Why do you suppose that is?

476
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:09,140
Not in front of my baby! No!

477
00:30:11,602 --> 00:30:13,978
Because not remembering saved me.

478
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:16,856
And now if you want to save yourself,
you have to remember.

479
00:30:24,198 --> 00:30:25,740
If you don't fix this screw-up,

480
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:28,743
Harrison's only memory of his father
will be of you behind bars.

481
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:31,787
It's not a screw-up.
I just can't remember.

482
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:35,750
Got to check today's incident reports.

483
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:39,253
Make sure Benny's body
hasn't surfaced.

484
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:41,923
It's in this city somewhere.

485
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:43,591
Thanks for meeting me here.

486
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:45,134
The sooner we get an estimate
and file a claim,

487
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,886
the sooner my husband
gets his car back.

488
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:50,765
Well, that much damage,
I wouldn't even try to talk you into fixing it.

489
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,019
I thought it was a fender bender.

490
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:58,439
Well, I'm sure there's a bent fender
somewhere in this mess.

491
00:30:58,565 --> 00:30:59,690
Oh, my God.

492
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,943
Everybody got off easy on this one.

493
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:04,445
Your husband, my company.

494
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:06,572
He should count his blessings.

495
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:09,909
Yes, he should.

496
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:11,827
Hey, buddy. You lose something?

497
00:31:11,954 --> 00:31:14,372
There's an understatement.

498
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:16,165
Can't find my ID.

499
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,709
Use mine to buzz you in.

500
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:20,545
All right.

501
00:31:21,255 --> 00:31:22,296
Thanks.

502
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:23,965
Look, the other day after court,

503
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:26,342
I was totally out of line
going off on you like that.

504
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:28,678
Gomez is the criminal, not you.

505
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:29,762
No, not me.

506
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,974
Plan on having a heart-to-heart
with the prick when I find him.

507
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,475
Benny?

508
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:37,770
Yeah, want him to know he's still
on my radar, but he's been laying low.

509
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,566
Look, can we do this
another time?

510
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,042
My password.

511
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:06,757
Access denied, Dex.

512
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:11,095
I can't even remember
my own password.

513
00:32:12,139 --> 00:32:14,390
I'm here to help.

514
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:16,183
Think.

515
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,939
H-A...

516
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,566
R-R-Y.

517
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,446
Thanks, Dad.

518
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,325
Bank hold-up.

519
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:34,160
Alligator in backyard.

520
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:36,829
Kidnapped three-year-old
found safe.

521
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,957
But no body parts turning up.

522
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:06,901
From boxing arena, to the pharmacy,
to the crash.

523
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:08,986
What am I missing?

524
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:15,242
Girl Scout cookie time again?

525
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:17,953
No, I froze them
in case of emergency.

526
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,831
What's the emergency?

527
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,083
Frank Lundy.

528
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:24,752
I haven't heard from him
in, like, forever,

529
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:26,212
and then he shows up out of the blue

530
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:29,840
for some hush-hush task force
and wants to know all about my case.

531
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,550
Not to drag you into my shit.

532
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:32,760
Drag away.

533
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:35,221
In this boys' club,
who else you gonna talk to?

534
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:37,431
This is about him trying
to get next to me.

535
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:40,059
Maybe, but you do have a boyfriend.

536
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:41,977
Hell yeah, I do.

537
00:33:42,104 --> 00:33:44,105
A good one.

538
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:45,731
And I'm really fucking happy.

539
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:50,152
Can I make a suggestion
before you eat the box too?

540
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:54,281
If there is still something, anything,
between you and Lundy...

541
00:33:54,408 --> 00:33:58,369
- There's so not.
- Well, closure will set you free.

542
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:03,040
Does my hair look better up or down?

543
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,959
Down, definitely.

544
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:07,586
Thanks.

545
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:14,385
OK, Benny, I gotta find you
before anyone else does.

546
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:16,470
Better fucking start all over again.

547
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:19,265
Nothing on the DNA results
from the blood on the cactus.

548
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:22,017
No match in the database. Sorry.

549
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:23,811
Hang on. No one's going anywhere.

550
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:25,980
- Oh, shit.
- Listen up, guys.

551
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:27,732
Everyone working
the Vacation Murders,

552
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:29,942
I'm holding over your shift
until further notice.

553
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:33,195
Call home, let your people know
they'll see you when they see you.

554
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,573
Quinn, my office.

555
00:34:50,172 --> 00:34:53,340
I'm gonna ask you if we have a problem
and I expect the truth.

556
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:55,634
Look, Lieutenant,
what happened at the hotel,

557
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:57,887
it's not what you think.

558
00:34:58,013 --> 00:34:59,889
Detective...

559
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:03,350
I'm not gonna tell you who to date.
It's none of my business.

560
00:35:03,477 --> 00:35:07,062
But you should know there's no such thing
as off the record with reporters.

561
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:10,274
So watch the pillow talk
with that woman.

562
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,901
Not a problem, Lieutenant.

563
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:14,487
Talking isn't what we do best anyway.

564
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:37,510
Debra. I thought I was picking you up.

565
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:39,303
I need to clear some things up

566
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:42,807
and I owe you nothing less
than complete transparency.

567
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:44,475
Want anything?

568
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:48,938
Tea? Water?

569
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:50,981
I don't want to mislead you.

570
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:54,068
And I certainly don't want to hurt you.

571
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:57,238
It's just that
what I have with Anton,

572
00:35:57,364 --> 00:36:00,407
it's... it's great.

573
00:36:00,534 --> 00:36:04,161
And it's really fucking great
and we live together.

574
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,788
And...

575
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:08,749
It's great. And...

576
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:13,587
for the first time in so long,
I'm actually...

577
00:36:14,548 --> 00:36:15,965
...happy.

578
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:18,551
No offense.

579
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:20,845
You sure you don't want
something to drink?

580
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:22,763
Did you not hear a word I just said?

581
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:25,724
- Everything's great.
- Exactly.

582
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:28,811
So if you've come back here to...

583
00:36:29,563 --> 00:36:33,607
rekindle something
between us...

584
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,109
it's not gonna happen.

585
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:37,945
In the interest of transparency,

586
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:40,281
my purpose in coming
to Miami is...

587
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:42,116
Work related.

588
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:44,076
Cut the shit, Frank. You're retired.

589
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,954
The reason I'm in Miami

590
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,457
is because I'm convinced
that these bathtub murders -

591
00:36:50,584 --> 00:36:52,877
Noonan's wife, Lisa Bell -

592
00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:57,089
are connected to a series of murders
all over the country.

593
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:08,559
Oh.

594
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:12,479
It's become something of
an obsession of mine and, uh...

595
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:16,817
I'm not about to ride off
into the sunset

596
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:18,777
and dump something this horrific

597
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:20,821
on whoever gets my office next.

598
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,281
Christ.

599
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,825
I...

600
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:28,537
I've got to go. I'm an idiot.

601
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,164
Debra.

602
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:44,511
- Rita, what are you doing here?
- You lied to me, Dexter.

603
00:37:44,638 --> 00:37:47,806
I saw your car. It wasn't a fender bender.
It was destroyed.

604
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:49,516
I didn't want you to worry.

605
00:37:49,643 --> 00:37:52,937
Yeah, well, you're not doing a good job.
I'm worried sick about you.

606
00:37:53,063 --> 00:37:54,980
I'm fine.

607
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,317
All right, a little headache
and a stiff neck.

608
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:00,361
- Get your stuff. I'm gonna take you home.
- I can't.

609
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:02,071
The lieutenant is holding over the shift

610
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:04,949
because of these murders
that are in all the papers.

611
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:07,910
You fell asleep at the wheel.

612
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:09,703
Almost got killed because of the hours

613
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:12,039
that they keep you here
night after night after night.

614
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:14,041
So much for my standard alibi.

615
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:15,709
This is a job I signed on for.

616
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,836
I'm sorry. I didn't sign on to be a widow.

617
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:19,713
You know what? I'll just talk to Maria myself.

618
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:23,676
Rita, no. Don't do this.
Not here. This is my job.

619
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:25,761
It's how I support all of us.

620
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:29,014
Not if you wind up dead in a ditch.

621
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:32,893
All these people put in
the same hours that I do.

622
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:39,400
Yes, but you were in the hospital last night.
They weren't.

623
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:42,987
And the doctor gave me
a clean bill of health.

624
00:38:43,113 --> 00:38:45,280
You could talk to him yourself.

625
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:53,789
No. No, I don't... I don't want
to talk to your doctor.

626
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:55,249
I want you to.

627
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:57,376
I mean, I guess he wouldn't
have released you

628
00:38:57,502 --> 00:39:00,337
if it was anything serious.

629
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:04,883
I'm sure they'd all rather be home
with their families, just like me.

630
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,262
I know.

631
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:10,889
Come on, I'll walk you out.

632
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,958
- You gonna pick that up?
- No, I am not, Vince.

633
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:40,085
You got a problem with that?

634
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:43,380
Dude, seriously, 86 the caffeine.

635
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:44,965
You're freaking me out.

636
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,800
I have someplace I need to be.

637
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,761
I also have places I need to be.

638
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:51,263
Not good places, but... places.

639
00:39:54,768 --> 00:39:57,019
Come on, blood. Talk to me.

640
00:39:59,773 --> 00:40:02,483
If somebody tested positive
for an STD,

641
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:06,320
would they have to register
with the Miami health authorities?

642
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:08,405
And why would you ask me that?

643
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:10,532
Yes or no, Vince.

644
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:19,208
Lieutenant. Found your guy.

645
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:20,834
Name's Johnny Rose.

646
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,337
- You found the suspect?
- All his info's in there.

647
00:40:23,463 --> 00:40:25,005
How?

648
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:27,758
I reworked the blood sample
looking for other markers

649
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:31,386
and found a Street 14 strain
of drug-resistant syphilis.

650
00:40:31,513 --> 00:40:33,889
I checked that against
the STD registry

651
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:37,351
for anyone being treated with
heavy-duty meds over the last week.

652
00:40:37,477 --> 00:40:40,479
Turned up a few prostitutes
and one Johnny Rose.

653
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:42,314
Good science says he's your guy.

654
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,859
OK, briefing room in five minutes.
Strategy meeting.

655
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:48,403
Dexter's turned up a lead on our shooter.

656
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:52,699
Hey, Dex, hold up.

657
00:40:52,826 --> 00:40:54,868
- I need to be somewhere.
- Good work back there.

658
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:56,954
This Rose guy gets syphilis
and fingered for murder?

659
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:00,874
- That's burning it at both ends, huh?
- Yeah, I really got to go. Wife, kids.

660
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,709
Come on, Dex.

661
00:41:02,836 --> 00:41:04,253
What do you say we grab
a beer this week,

662
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:06,046
figure out how to come
at Benny Gomez next?

663
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,297
Quinn!

664
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:09,091
I have a life. You have a life.

665
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:11,301
Just leave it alone. All right?

666
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:21,061
Benny Gomez.

667
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:25,023
The last place I'm gonna look
is the last place I saw you.

668
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:28,443
Moment of your time, Lieutenant?

669
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,072
Escúchame, Maria.

670
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:35,868
Angel...

671
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:39,746
...people will think something's up.

672
00:41:39,873 --> 00:41:41,415
Something is.

673
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:47,462
Angel, if this is about the mayor,
I had no choice.

674
00:41:47,589 --> 00:41:50,340
I'm not angry about
you taking me off the case.

675
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:51,592
It's how you did it.

676
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:53,760
Ay, Angel, por favor.

677
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:58,390
I don't even know how
to act around you anymore.

678
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,392
This isn't easy for me either.

679
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:07,232
Maybe we need a...

680
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,692
break.

681
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:12,863
Yeah, you're right.

682
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:15,240
It's probably for the best.

683
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:20,162
So that's that.

684
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,498
So that's that.

685
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,437
So?

686
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,606
So.

687
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,403
Why are we thinking ourselves
out of a good thing?

688
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:05,666
- What do you think's going on in there?
- Who cares?

689
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:14,424
I'm so glad you're home.

690
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:17,010
Hey, it's not my birthday.

691
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:19,513
Can't a girlfriend be glad
her boyfriend's home?

692
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:21,848
I was gone for two days.

693
00:43:21,975 --> 00:43:23,809
I fucking love you.

694
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:27,980
- I love you.
- I love you. I love you.

695
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:29,481
I love you.

696
00:43:36,281 --> 00:43:37,990
Back to square one.

697
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:40,867
Literally.

698
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,542
Yeah?

699
00:43:48,668 --> 00:43:51,545
Dexter. Frank Lundy here.

700
00:43:51,671 --> 00:43:54,214
The last person in the world
I want to hear from.

701
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,049
Glad to hear from you.

702
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:58,760
I need to talk to you...

703
00:43:58,886 --> 00:43:59,928
about Trinity.

704
00:44:06,019 --> 00:44:10,772
I'm tired of swimming against
the bureaucratic tide by myself.

705
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:13,108
Can we maybe toss
a few ideas around?

706
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:15,444
You seem to have
the dot-connecting gift.

707
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:16,862
More like had.

708
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:22,117
I'm glad to help,
but tonight's not really, um...

709
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:25,620
- optimal.
- I get it. New dad, new family.

710
00:44:25,747 --> 00:44:27,914
Your life has changed
in so many ways.

711
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:30,584
Yeah, I see that now.

712
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:32,836
Trinity is going to kill again.

713
00:44:32,962 --> 00:44:35,714
Soon. Another woman.

714
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,632
Older than Lisa Bell this time.

715
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:42,721
Somewhere out there is a woman
who is going to die...

716
00:44:43,723 --> 00:44:45,515
and she'll have no idea why.

717
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:49,227
Whoa, whoa!

718
00:44:49,354 --> 00:44:51,229
Watch your step there.

719
00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:52,898
Oh, hey.

720
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:54,941
How cute are you?

721
00:44:55,068 --> 00:44:57,694
You smell my puppy, don't you?

722
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,988
- What's his name?
- This is Checkers.

723
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,158
My mother was
a lifelong Republican.

724
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:06,078
- Well, no family's perfect.
- Indeed.

725
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:08,789
What kind of pup you have?

726
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:11,958
Um, just a mutt,
but she's great with my children.

727
00:45:12,085 --> 00:45:13,543
So you must live around here, huh?

728
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:15,796
Yeah, it's such a great neighborhood.
Everyone's so friendly.

729
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:18,298
Well, in the interest of friendly,
let me help you with these.

730
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:20,258
Oh, it's really OK. I'm just up there.

731
00:45:20,385 --> 00:45:23,804
So I'll take one, you take the other.
Lighten the load, huh?

732
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:26,014
I appreciate it. My arms were falling off.

733
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:31,853
My dog won't get your puppy
all riled up?

734
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:33,772
Molly? Oh, God, no.

735
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:36,483
She's the calmest little thing
in the world.

736
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:38,110
How long have you lived around here?

737
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:39,611
Uh, three years next month.

738
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:43,156
Surprised we've never
run into each other till now.

739
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:45,117
I'm Allen, by the way.

740
00:45:45,243 --> 00:45:47,244
- Tarla.
- Tarla.

741
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:49,830
Um, this is me.
Thank you so much for your help.

742
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:51,665
Sure.

743
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:53,125
Great.

744
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:56,336
Oh, and bye to you too, Checkers.

745
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:58,380
Until next time.

746
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:16,690
Off you go, Checkers,
or whatever your name is.

747
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:23,655
Lundy thinks he can
predict the future,

748
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:26,616
but I'm more interested in the past.

749
00:46:27,702 --> 00:46:29,995
My past.

750
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:33,540
I already cleaned this.

751
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:35,625
That I remember.

752
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,217
Now it makes sense.

753
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:48,054
Harry was reminding me
the whole time.

754
00:46:51,851 --> 00:46:54,811
I was reminding myself
the whole time.

755
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:11,703
Hello, Benny.

756
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:17,375
Goodbye, Benny.

757
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:42,859
Got to admit...
pretty clever.

758
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:48,114
Hiding Benny Gomez like that
until I could come back and get him.

759
00:47:48,241 --> 00:47:49,908
You turned to the code.

760
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:53,119
A core memory.

761
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:56,373
I taught you well.

762
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:01,086
Finding Gomez was a band-aid.

763
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:03,505
You're juggling family, work...

764
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:07,717
and a dark passenger who's always got
one hand on the steering wheel.

765
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:10,679
I can do it.

766
00:48:12,098 --> 00:48:14,099
I can manage...

767
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:16,935
all these moving parts.

768
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:21,314
Until you can't.

769
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,400
Then what?

770
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:29,447
Night, Dad.

771
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:32,576
Sleep.

772
00:48:32,702 --> 00:48:35,120
Just one beautiful night's sleep

773
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:39,124
will make everything better... again.

774
00:48:52,138 --> 00:48:53,138
Fuck.
