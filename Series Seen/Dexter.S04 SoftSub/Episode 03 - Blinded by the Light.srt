1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,753
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:08,591
Do you know where you are?

3
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:11,094
- Ambulance. What happened?
- You were in an accident.

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,221
Bad news is that
you sustained a concussion.

5
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:15,098
I'd like to keep you here for observation.

6
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:17,725
Dexter! Oh, my God!

7
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:21,187
- You all right?
- I'm fine. Just a little fender bender.

8
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:22,563
Doc says I'm good to go.

9
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:23,856
You got a minute?

10
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,692
I'd like to pick your brain.

11
00:00:25,818 --> 00:00:27,360
Lisa Bell?

12
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:29,070
The girl in the bathtub.

13
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:32,573
Of course. The Trinity Killer's
most recent victim.

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,033
Trinity is going to kill again.

15
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:36,953
Another woman.
Older than Lisa Bell this time.

16
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,456
The person that you should really be talking
to is my sister. She's lead on Lisa Bell.

17
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,875
You sure that's a good call?
Given our history.

18
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:48,047
I wouldn't want to mislead you.
What I have with Anton. It's... It's great.

19
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,757
I fucking love you.

20
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,969
The reason I'm in Miami
is because I'm convinced

21
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:58,057
these bathtub murders are connected to
a series of murders all over the country.

22
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,393
Christ. I'm an idiot.

23
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:01,728
Debra!

24
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:03,479
Tell me again this isn't crazy.

25
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:04,856
Crazy good.

26
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,401
I brought you a copy of my article.

27
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:11,070
"A string of robberies turned deadly
in what authorities

28
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,822
"are now calling the Vacation Murder."

29
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:14,907
Found your guy.
Name's Johnny Rose.

30
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,243
Briefing room in five minutes.
Strategy meeting.

31
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:19,495
Dexter's turned up a lead
on our shooter.

32
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:26,002
Don't sweat it, Quinn.

33
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:28,254
I've got much bigger things
to worry about.

34
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,756
I thought it was a fender bender.

35
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:32,425
I'm sure there's a bent fender
somewhere in this mess.

36
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:33,676
Oh, my God.

37
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:36,888
- Rita, what are you doing here?
- You lied to me, Dexter.

38
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:36,382
The backyard barbecue.

39
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:40,261
It's a holdover from the last ice age
when food was scarce

40
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:44,348
and men had to work together
to take down such a large beast.

41
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:47,727
Those who worked well with others
survived,

42
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:50,396
and their genes have been passed down
through the centuries

43
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,565
until they landed here,

44
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:54,066
in this...

45
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,819
my community.

46
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,008
Soda?

47
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:21,177
Whatever.

48
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,057
How about you?

49
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,560
I'm good.

50
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,731
Ah, wasted youth.

51
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,777
Hey, can I talk to you
for a second?

52
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:39,070
Yeah.

53
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,908
I just got off the phone
with Dr. Montgomery,

54
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,869
the doctor that took care of you
after your accident.

55
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,537
Oh, right.

56
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:50,665
Why didn't you tell me
you had a concussion?

57
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,333
I just wanted
to keep you from worrying.

58
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,001
You already have so much
to deal with.

59
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,545
The doctor also told you
you weren't supposed to drive

60
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:58,589
for the next ten days,
and you didn't listen.

61
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,299
So I will now be doing all your driving.

62
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,969
I will take you to work in the morning
and pick you up at the end of the day.

63
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:05,471
- Rita, I'm perfectly capable...
- Dexter.

64
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:11,060
The past few weeks, you have not been
the most present father and husband.

65
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:13,437
Remember, we're a team here, right?

66
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,357
OK? We work together.

67
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:21,988
She's right. Maybe now's the time
to turn that around, score a few points.

68
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:24,073
Which will then make Rita
more likely to say yes

69
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,659
when I need a little time for myself.

70
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,244
You're right.

71
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,745
I'm sorry.

72
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,665
Thank you. Let's go eat.

73
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:39,213
So I guess you saw somebody
bashed in Kate's birdbath.

74
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,424
I know, that's awful.

75
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,676
Poor birds.

76
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:45,469
And poor Kate.

77
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,179
Why would someone do such a thing?

78
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,765
For the same reason he knocked over
the Andersons' fountain,

79
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,143
pulled down the Garcias'
basketball hoop

80
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:54,437
and spray-painted the Schwarzes'
trash cans. He's a dick.

81
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:56,605
He knocked the sea horse
off my mailbox, too.

82
00:05:56,732 --> 00:05:58,607
I hated that sea horse.

83
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:01,318
Well, your mom picked it out.

84
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:06,282
- You know Andy.
- Uh, yeah, of course.

85
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:09,368
Hi, how are you doing?
Hey, Jess. Jess. Jess?

86
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,078
Do you really need
to be doing that?

87
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,872
Yeah, I really do.

88
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:15,332
His wife passed away last year.

89
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:19,211
So, um, so about this
neighborhood vandal.

90
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,380
We all need to work together
to deal with this guy.

91
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,508
The last thing we need is a dangerous
presence in our neighborhood.

92
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:28,679
You know, it's a funny thing, Dexter. This all
started to happen time you moved in.

93
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,514
A little suspicious, don't you think?

94
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,310
I'm just busting your chops.

95
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:36,395
Oh.

96
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:37,772
My chops are busted.

97
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:41,233
The danger of community
is that the people who don't belong

98
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,777
are looked upon with suspicion.

99
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:46,072
Those of us who prefer
to work by ourselves,

100
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:48,657
the lone wolves,
risk being singled out.

101
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:51,494
Cody. What's that?

102
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,828
Waah!

103
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:58,209
- I'm gonna get you!
- Oh, I'm scared!

104
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,214
So I become an expert at blending in,
camouflaging myself,

105
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,466
becoming one of the guys.

106
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:08,594
Astor, what's that?

107
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,887
Oh, my God!

108
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:11,055
Dexter!

109
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:14,600
I'm so humiliated.

110
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:17,478
What were you thinking?

111
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,355
She was wearing a bathing suit.

112
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:22,316
This blending-in thing
isn't as easy as it looks.

113
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,667
We're here.

114
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,460
Stop right here.

115
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,846
It's OK.

116
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,435
Oh!

117
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:00,855
Oh, God, please don't hurt me.

118
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,899
Oh, God! Oh, God!

119
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,078
Don't do anything stupid.

120
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:23,043
Careful, now.

121
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,629
Wouldn't want to hurt yourself.

122
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:42,062
It's pretty, isn't it?

123
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,943
OK, now.
It's time for you to jump.

124
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,612
What?

125
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:51,572
God, no.

126
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,033
Yes. It always ends like this.

127
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,868
- No, but...
- Shh.

128
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,330
It's already over.

129
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,709
Why are you doing this to me?

130
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:05,377
You know I'm not to blame here.

131
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,795
Oh, God!

132
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:08,339
- Come on, now.
- Oh no.

133
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,345
Please, no!

134
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:17,014
You just need to let go...

135
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,600
and fall.

136
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,101
Please, I'll do anything.

137
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:22,937
- Good. Jump.
- No, I can't!

138
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,147
- You can.
- I have children!

139
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:28,234
I know. Jason and Susie.

140
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:30,945
If you like, I can swing by your house,

141
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,572
put an ice pick
in your husband's head,

142
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:36,450
and bring your kids back
and throw them off one at a time

143
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,369
till you finally decide to jump.

144
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,872
Is that what you want?

145
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:46,961
Please...

146
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,297
- What?
- Please.

147
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:53,175
Just push me.

148
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,598
Doesn't work that way.

149
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,894
Jump.

150
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:27,126
Oh...

151
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:29,837
Mommy.

152
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:24,892
You've only been here a month
and they've already got you tagged.

153
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,852
It's not just me.
There are other houses.

154
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:30,064
Dex, we've been through this before.
11th grade.

155
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,066
Bunch of kids T.P.ed the house.

156
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,984
And you made me clean it up.

157
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:37,237
Because it raised questions, Dexter.

158
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,907
It would have made people think,
"Why this kid? Why him?"

159
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,409
You can't afford to have people
asking those questions.

160
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,245
No one's asking questions.

161
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:47,790
Getting married, having a kid,

162
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,666
moving here...

163
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,752
I know you're under a lot of pressure.

164
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,253
Yeah, I am.

165
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,464
But you can't let things slip.

166
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:01,553
I'm not slipping.
But somebody is.

167
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:18,904
How come you never make the coffee,
even if you're up first?

168
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,740
'Cause I don't want it
bad enough to make it.

169
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,325
I don't even know
what to say to that.

170
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,577
If there was chocolate cake here
I would eat it,

171
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,621
but I sure as hell don't want to bake one.

172
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:35,337
- Hey! Good news!
- Yeah?

173
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:38,549
Yeah, the Sandpiper Hotel wants to book
my band for a one-month gig.

174
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,593
- Three nights a week.
- Wow, that's great.

175
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,804
No more cruise ships.

176
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,432
And best of all, it means
no more time away from you.

177
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:47,683
Really?

178
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,268
Yeah, I'll be here every day.

179
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:53,522
Going to bed with you every night.
Waking up with you every morning.

180
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:57,526
Waiting for you to make me coffee.

181
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,829
♪ You come and go

182
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,664
OK, if I count yesterday,

183
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:15,252
then this is day two of me being
the best husband in the world.

184
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:16,962
I can last another five days.

185
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:19,506
I really need to stop
for a coffee someplace.

186
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,674
You already had a coffee.

187
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,553
♪ Red, gold, and green

188
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:27,639

♪ Survival

190
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:34,771
Really, I started Saturday afternoon,
so it's actually been more like 2½ days.

191
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:37,149
♪ Every day is like survival ♪

192
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:39,860
Only 4½ to go.

193
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,154
I'm never gonna make it.

194
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,532
As far as our Vacation Murder suspect,
Johnny Rose,

195
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,493
we've still come up with nothing.

196
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:51,622
We've spoken to his mother, his sister,
his past two employers...

197
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:55,167
Everyone in his building, his mailman,
the liquor store guy across the street.

198
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:56,627
So no one's talking.

199
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:59,087
We have his immediate family members
under surveillance,

200
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:01,840
- but we're still not getting any hits.
- Well, expand the search.

201
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,342
Draw up a new list of subjects.

202
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:05,552
Morgan, where do we stand
on the Lisa Bell murder?

203
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,221
Somewhere in the middle of Shit Creek.

204
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:10,849
Well, find a paddle, or I'm moving you onto
the Vacation Murder with the rest of us.

205
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,185
Finding Johnny Rose
is our number-one priority.

206
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:16,188
- Yes, ma'am.
- Dexter. Hey.

207
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:17,231
Uh, hi.

208
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,900
Quick question -
do you like the Dolphins?

209
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:23,278
I'm really more
of a manatee guy, but sure.

210
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,030
Club level seats.

211
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:27,032
- Enjoy.
- Why?

212
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:28,367
I can't go.

213
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:31,703
And I asked myself who's a friend
that I could give 'em to?

214
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,707
So I thought of you.

215
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,673
Miami Dolphins. Football.

216
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,216
Club level?

217
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:48,387
Jeez, who do I gotta fuck
to get those kind of tickets?

218
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:50,180
Here.

219
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,517
No fucking.

220
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,602
Dude.

221
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:59,731
All right, listen up. We got a report of
a female body found at the old port.

222
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,817
Looks like a jumper.
Who wants it?

223
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:03,235
Sounds exciting, sarge,

224
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:05,571
but I think I'm gonna hold out
for a cat stuck in a tree.

225
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:08,740
Huh, I wonder if that's the woman
Lundy predicted.

226
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,242
We'll take it.

227
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:11,660
OK.

228
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:14,538
Unless she landed on a pile of
marshmallows, there's gonna be blood.

229
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,790
- Grab your kit.
- Sure, I'll follow you there.

230
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,751
Ha-ha! Not a chance, concussion-boy.
Rita said no driving for you.

231
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,045
You're coming with us.

232
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:30,929
Climb in the back, Dexter.
You'll be right on the subwoofer.

233
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,056
You can feel the bass in your spine.

234
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,064
Loud!

235
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:55,495
Female. Caucasian.
Mid-thirties, I'm guessing.

236
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:58,498
If this is the latest victim
of Lundy's Trinity Killer,

237
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,293
then he's a very different monster than I am.

238
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:02,586
Cause of death?

239
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,466
Gravity.

240
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:11,678
Why her? Why here?

241
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,473
What is Trinity's code?

242
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,058
Does he have one?

243
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:19,061
No sign of a struggle.
No pre-mortem bruising.

244
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:20,395
No ligature marks.

245
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,439
It's looking like a suicide to me.

246
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:27,110
Oh, well, if it isn't
Special Agent Grandpa.

247
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:30,197
- Shut up, Quinn.
- Detectives.

248
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,115
- Morgan.
- Agent Lundy.

249
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:34,576
Masuka.

250
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,286
Cool hat.

251
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,913
You have a name yet?

252
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:41,291
Driver's license in her car says Tarla Grant
from Fort Lauderdale.

253
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,002
So what brings you
to our little suicide?

254
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,295
Just observing.

255
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,589
You're a little quick to decide it's a suicide.

256
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,675
Still has her jewelry, her wallet.
Wasn't robbed.

257
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:51,510
Why would she drive
from Fort Lauderdale

258
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:54,513
- to jump off this abandoned warehouse?
- Maybe she liked seagulls.

259
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,017
Until we know one way or the other, I'll treat
this as a homicide if that's OK with you.

260
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,352
All right.

261
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:03,814
You two, on the sixth floor.
The rest of you, search the grounds.

262
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,941
Victim - Tarla Grant.

263
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,526
Thirties...

264
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:10,570
So, listen...

265
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:13,657
I want to apologize for being such a douche
the other night.

266
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,534
No need.

267
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,286
We're all allowed to be
the occasional douche.

268
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:19,913
Thanks.

269
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:23,166
It was pretty embarrassing.

270
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,712
Debra, if we're being
completely honest here,

271
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:30,215
then, uh, yes, I did come to Miami
to follow a case.

272
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:34,010
But... I have to admit that...

273
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:37,055
I'm glad the killer chose this city,

274
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:39,391
knowing I'd find you here.

275
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,563
So is Dexter right?
Did you predict this jumper?

276
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:47,774
What I did was suggest
that if Trinity held to his pattern,

277
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,403
we could expect to see
another woman die soon.

278
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:52,904
Is this her?

279
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,365
Little early to tell.

280
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:58,076
But you might want to check
your missing persons reports.

281
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:01,538
I wouldn't be surprised to discover
that she's married with two kids.

282
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:02,789
What else?

283
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:07,419
I'm very curious to know if there was
a similar death at this site 30 years ago.

284
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,254
I make my bodies disappear.

285
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,673
Trinity leaves his out in the open,

286
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:15,260
supremely confident that no one
will ever trace them to him,

287
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:17,429
decade after decade...

288
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:21,057
after decade.

289
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:33,695
Thanks for the ride.

290
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,363
Anytime, partner.

291
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:02,682
Great - security lights.

292
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:05,644
Just what every serial killer needs.

293
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,647
What are you looking at?

294
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:17,364
- Oh.
- Dexter!

295
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:21,993
Did you get my message about
the neighborhood watch meeting?

296
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:25,163
Actually, no, I didn't.

297
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:28,917
This is my community.
I am one of you.

298
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:31,920
Uh, great.
Love having the neighbors over.

299
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:35,423
- Are you ready to fight crime, Dexter?
- You betcha.

300
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,342
That's good.
Be aware of your neighbors.

301
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:40,303
Know their schedules. That way
you'll know if something's different,

302
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,472
- if anything seems off.
- We don't want that.

303
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,684
Here, have a whistle
and a head flashlight.

304
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:49,354
It'll keep your hands free
when you're out patrolling.

305
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,690
Patrolling? We're patrolling?

306
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:55,443
Your job is to watch and report,
watch and report.

307
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,779
- Watch and report.
- You got it.

308
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:02,701
Community college for me now.

309
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:06,246
Dexter, our neighborhood beautification
association asked me to give this to you.

310
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:09,541
I'm the secretary. It's a warning
against the graffiti on your gate.

311
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:11,501
I know it's silly,
but they want you to repaint.

312
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:12,544
Hey, Dex.

313
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:16,923
I guess you saw the new
motion-detector lights I just put in.

314
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,466
Sure are bright.

315
00:20:18,593 --> 00:20:20,051
Yeah, brightest I could get.

316
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,679
Made sure I angled one
right on your place, too.

317
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:25,140
That's very neighborly of you.

318
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:26,808
We have to look after each other.

319
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:30,228
Yeah, this guy started off small,
a few broken windows, Andy's mailbox,

320
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:33,857
but yesterday he broke into the Walkers'
guesthouse and trashed the place.

321
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,984
Yeah, next thing
he'll be stealing our women.

322
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:39,654
Can't let him steal our women now,
can we?

323
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,281
No, they're our women.

324
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,701
- Is that the sign-up sheet?
- Yeah, yeah.

325
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:46,745
We're setting up patrols
for every night of the week.

326
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:50,248
I'm good for every night but Wednesday.
I got a poker night at the lodge.

327
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:51,958
Great.

328
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:55,253
No one will come in or out
of this neighborhood unnoticed.

329
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,588
Including me.

330
00:20:56,714 --> 00:21:01,176
It's not the neighborhood vandal I'm worried
about, it's the neighborhood watch.

331
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,972
Hmm, graffiti.

332
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,766
Excuse me.

333
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:10,769
So I was all set to go to
the University of Miami next year

334
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:13,146
till my dad decided
to get himself laid off.

335
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,773
That blows.

336
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:16,775
How about you, Jesse?

337
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:19,361
You want to sign up for
the neighborhood watch?

338
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:20,779
Sounds kind of lame.

339
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:22,280
So lame.

340
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:28,954
Paint can, soda can.
I'm thinking fingerprints.

341
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,956
Let me get that for you.

342
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,876
And I know one little lady
who is up past her bedtime.

343
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:37,045
Mom!

344
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,634
Dexter, you can't treat her
like a little girl anymore.

345
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:45,053
I can't?

346
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,225
Hey, Dex.

347
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:52,018
Hey, Elliot.

348
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:08,451
Have a nice day!

349
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,925
You knew this day
would come, Dexter.

350
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:27,012
You've always been good with kids,
but eventually they grow up.

351
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:29,639
They become more mature,

352
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:32,517
develop complex emotions
that just aren't in your skill set.

353
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:34,686
Astor's becoming a whole person,
and you're...

354
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:36,312
Something less.

355
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:38,356
I hope you're not taking
any of this seriously,

356
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:41,276
the wife, the kids,
the house in the 'burbs.

357
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:44,696
It's all great camouflage,
but that's all it is.

358
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:46,573
It's gotten more complicated than that.

359
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:48,450
Then uncomplicate it.

360
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:52,620
You need to realize your limitations.
Remember exactly who you are.

361
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:55,623
Probably should have used
something a little darker.

362
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,209
It's fine, Dad.
Nothing's gonna show through.

363
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,755
I hope not, Dex.
For your sake.

364
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:07,052
- Hey, you ready to go?
- Almost.

365
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:08,845
I've got The Best Of Bananarama.

366
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:12,390
It's a cruel summer.

367
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:18,897
As long as the neighborhood vandal
keeps my neighbors on edge,

368
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:21,066
I will have no privacy.

369
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:30,200
And I'm not going to let you
do that to me, Jesse.

370
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,082
Tarla Grant,
married, mother of two.

371
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,750
It fits.

372
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:40,752
- Fits what?
- Lundy's theory.

373
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:42,754
That she's another victim
of the serial killer?

374
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,006
Yes.

375
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:48,593
- What?
- His whole life is about serial killers.

376
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:52,013
That's all he thinks about, so of course
he thinks she was killed by a serial killer.

377
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,307
I think he's a little smarter than that.

378
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,935
I'm sure you do, otherwise
you wouldn't be sitting at your desk

379
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:59,145
going through 30-year-old files all afternoon.

380
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:02,065
Oh, yeah? Guess what.
So are you.

381
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:05,610
Just unsealed the juvey records
of Johnny Rose,

382
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:07,278
our Vacation Murder suspect.

383
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:08,613
Anything?

384
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:11,783
Shoplifting with his high school girlfriend,
Nikki Wald.

385
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:15,787
That was like, what, ten years ago?
You think they're still in touch?

386
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:19,541
Since she testified against him back then,
I'd say extremely unlikely.

387
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:22,961
Well, at this point, I think
we need to take any shot we can.

388
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:25,964
She lives in Oakland Park.
I'll drive out there with you.

389
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,799
Let's go.

390
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:34,264
That seem accidental
and unplanned to you?

391
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:36,182
Even I believed it.

392
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,810
I was thinking we could stop
somewhere for lunch first.

393
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:43,356
I know a little place where
we can order some room service.

394
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,651
OK, here we go.
30 years ago to the week.

395
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:50,363
Female, Caucasian, 36,
mother of two.

396
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,407
Jumped to her death
off the same warehouse.

397
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:55,243
The woman's family insisted
she was the victim of foul play,

398
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:58,538
- but it was ruled a suicide.
- Doesn't mean fuck all.

399
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:02,709
Someone fell or jumped off
the same warehouse eight years ago.

400
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:06,921
Someone else jumped off a ship loading
crane on the same pier back in '86,

401
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:09,299
and another body
washed up on the rocks

402
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:12,051
right in front of the warehouse
only two years ago.

403
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:13,678
Nobody knows how it got there.

404
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:15,597
This is Miami, Deb.
People die.

405
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:19,100
And sometimes it's by murder.
I want to follow up on this.

406
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:22,187
OK, Tarla Grant seemed
to have a pretty decent life.

407
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:25,190
No apparent reason for suicide,
so keep it open for now.

408
00:25:25,316 --> 00:25:27,233
Fuckin'-A we'll keep it open.

409
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,152
I'd know that foul mouth anywhere.

410
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,530
Anton, what are you doing here?

411
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:35,241
I love you too, baby.
Come on, let's have some lunch.

412
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,951
I have a fuckload of work to do.

413
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,165
All right.

414
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,044
All right, but it's a working lunch.

415
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,755
Ah, solitude.

416
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:51,549
Something I won't enjoy again
until I deal with Jesse,

417
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,885
the neighborhood shithead.

418
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,307
Hey, Dexter.

419
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:00,683
Hey.

420
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:04,604
Dexter, I was looking for you.
Hello, Debra.

421
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,814
- Hi.
- May I?

422
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:07,941
Yeah.

423
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,612
Frank Lundy.

424
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:15,198
- Anton Briggs.
- My lover...

425
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:18,201
Friend. My boyfriend.

426
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:21,204
All of the above.

427
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,957
So, Dexter, I was wondering

428
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:27,085
if you'd gotten the blood tox results back
on Tarla Grant yet?

429
00:26:27,211 --> 00:26:29,087
Yeah, I should check
on that right away.

430
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:31,172
- Please, finish your lunch.
- Mm.

431
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:32,465
All done.

432
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:39,806
Tarla Grant, just like you said.
36 years old, married, mother of two.

433
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:43,351
- That's a shame.
- I found a matching 30-year-old case.

434
00:26:44,395 --> 00:26:47,272
- What's that?
- Big case we're working on.

435
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:51,442
I'm afraid I've enlisted Debra
in another of my mad theories.

436
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:53,736
Ah.

437
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:55,989
What's it all about?

438
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:57,907
Finding out who killed her.

439
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:03,371
I don't suppose you happened to bring the...

440
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:05,415
30-year-old file?

441
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:08,293
Read the husband's statement
from 30 years ago.

442
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:10,253
Family never believed
it was a suicide.

443
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:15,550
But since Trinity never leaves a trace,
there was nothing to investigate.

444
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:24,058
You give good room service, Angel.

445
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,853
You know, uh, we should
do lunch out more often.

446
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:30,898
Missed one.

447
00:27:33,736 --> 00:27:36,654
No arrests since she got busted with Rose
back in high school.

448
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,448
Spotty job record,
but that's about it.

449
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:40,366
It's a stretch, I know.

450
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,000
Nikki?

451
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:53,838
Nikki Wald?

452
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:56,966
Hmm. I'm not sure
Miss Nikki Wald is home.

453
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:00,470
OK.

454
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:05,933
Hey, I'm Sergeant Batista
from Miami Metro homicide.

455
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,226
- It's Rose.
- Get down!

456
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:16,069
Shots fired, 41st and Andrews.
We need backup!

457
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:17,653
- Good?
- Yeah, I'm good, let's go.

458
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:29,707
Suspects Johnny Rose
and Nikki Wald going northbound

459
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,043
on 41st Street in a white sedan.

460
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:34,087
- I think it was gray.
- A light-colored sedan.

461
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:35,588
Make? Model?

462
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:38,383
Suspects are
armed and dangerous.

463
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:46,557
Rita thinks I'm with
the neighborhood watch.

464
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:50,019
Truth is, I'm gonna do
a little more than watch.

465
00:28:51,105 --> 00:28:55,274
There's dad,
off to his weekly poker game.

466
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:03,366
And if I were the delinquent son...

467
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:07,954
I would take advantage
of my father's absence.

468
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:11,749
Going after him feels very familiar,

469
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:14,627
except it won't have
its usual satisfying ending.

470
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:18,297
The best I can do is scare
a little sense into this kid.

471
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:28,641
Hey! Come on, it's the vandal.
Let's get him!

472
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,435
Oh, fuck.

473
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:45,408
It's watch and report, assholes,
not watch and chase.

474
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,494
This is so humiliating.

475
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:52,790
Go that way.

476
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:25,281
This neighborhood's gonna kill me.

477
00:30:32,206 --> 00:30:33,831
Already? The kids
aren't even dressed yet.

478
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:38,419
I know, I know, I'm early. Just wanted you
to see the latest work of the vandal.

479
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:43,174
Happened in the middle of the night.

480
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,511
He obviously smashed the window,
released the emergency brake,

481
00:30:46,637 --> 00:30:49,847
Gave it a shove,
and, uh, let it roll.

482
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,682
Oh, that's so dangerous.

483
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:54,101
Is that Cody's bike?

484
00:30:54,228 --> 00:30:55,561
Oh, my God.

485
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:58,147
What if he had been out here playing?

486
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:11,619
These dummies share the same size
and weight distribution as our victim.

487
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:14,622
At this height,
any variant in trajectory

488
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:17,625
resulting from a simple jump
or being pushed off the building

489
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:19,418
will be evident
in where they land.

490
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:22,088
What if she took a running leap?

491
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:26,050
People don't kill themselves that way.
They just let go.

492
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:29,804
Oh, hey, either of you interested in buying
tickets to the Dolphins game?

493
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,764
Club level? I'll let them go for 500 bucks.

494
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,391
- Where'd you get those?
- Dexter.

495
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:34,642
Son of a bitch.

496
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:36,561
Come on,
we have dummies to drop.

497
00:31:36,687 --> 00:31:38,980
Is he gonna pay me for those?

498
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,568
Must be weird for you,
Lundy coming back.

499
00:31:43,694 --> 00:31:45,403
Why would it be weird?
You're weird.

500
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:47,655
None of my business, I know.

501
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:49,532
But...

502
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:52,910
if I loved someone,
and that person was gone,

503
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:55,162
and then I moved on,
and then found someone else,

504
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:57,540
and then the first person
suddenly showed up again...

505
00:31:57,666 --> 00:32:00,793
I don't know,
I've never had that problem.

506
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,421
But it's gotta be a little confusing.

507
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:05,047
Maybe.

508
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:07,550
A little.

509
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:11,971
So then maybe if you know that it's
supposed to be weird and confusing,

510
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:14,390
then maybe it's a little easier to handle.

511
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,392
Thanks.

512
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:20,229
It's always the same
three kills with Trinity -

513
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:23,274
a young woman in a bathtub,

514
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:27,069
followed by a mother
falling to her death,

515
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,488
and ending with a man
getting bludgeoned.

516
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:32,908
I put her in a short skirt so that we can see
her panties while she's falling.

517
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,707
Specific.

518
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:43,961
How many times
that you know of?

519
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:47,965
I've got the bits and pieces
that add up to at least 15 cycles.

520
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:52,178
Since we just turned the clock
back another 15 years...

521
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:56,182
I'm sure there are
considerably more.

522
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,017
Wow.

523
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,770
That's impressive.

524
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:06,651
In a very evil way.

525
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:11,489
What's really impressive
is that I can't prove a thing.

526
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:15,660
Could never get anyone at the Bureau
convinced. He's that good.

527
00:33:15,786 --> 00:33:18,496
Why do you think
he's so successful?

528
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:24,210
Trinity's likely someone who's gone
his own solitary way through life,

529
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:26,337
so preoccupied
with his own obsessions

530
00:33:26,463 --> 00:33:31,884
that he's foregone all but the most
rudimentary of human connections.

531
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,679
A lone wolf.

532
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:36,305
Exactly.

533
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:39,141
It's a little bit disturbing.

534
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,310
- Yeah.
- I mean...

535
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:45,690
I could just as well
be talking about myself.

536
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,859
Sure, I've been married.

537
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:52,363
Was married for 29 years, happily.

538
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:54,448
But even so,

539
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:58,494
the only thing that really got
my heart beating was the hunt.

540
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,539
I'm sure you can't relate.

541
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:04,375
No, sorry.

542
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:07,378
And now here I am at 60,

543
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:09,922
watching dummies fly off a roof,

544
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,049
still on the hunt.

545
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:15,553
It sounds like Trinity
is worthy prey.

546
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:21,225
What's really got me intrigued
is the notion that he's returned to Miami.

547
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:24,687
He's come home.

548
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:28,190
I'm not sure "home" is the right word.

549
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:33,320
People like us
don't really belong anywhere.

550
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:36,490
We just pass through.

551
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:46,769
Drink up.

552
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:53,776
You're next.

553
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:05,120
The Vacation Murders.

554
00:36:05,247 --> 00:36:07,706
Word is, you know who
Johnny Rose's accomplice is.

555
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:10,584
Forget it, you'll get the press release
same time as everyone else.

556
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,170
But my sergeant and lieutenant
were almost killed yesterday,

557
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:16,298
so if you put any negative spin on it,
I'll be very angry.

558
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,425
When you're angry,
you're very sexy,

559
00:36:18,552 --> 00:36:20,928
so this could be
sort of a win-win for me.

560
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:24,640
Let's just say I'll be angry
in a very withholding sort of way.

561
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:25,933
OK.

562
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:28,352
- The bathtub murder?
- Still under investigation.

563
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:31,313
The jumper at the old port building?

564
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,439
Ditto.

565
00:36:32,566 --> 00:36:34,358
I gotta run. See you tonight?

566
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:35,651
Sure.

567
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:38,070
Can you just go over
the figures one more time?

568
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,530
They're not gonna change.

569
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:42,658
The test results indicate that Tarla Grant
jumped rather than was pushed.

570
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:44,994
I don't buy it.
I think we're looking at a murder victim.

571
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,413
Deb, we also got the autopsy report.
She had a small tumor.

572
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:49,957
Talked to the husband.
They just found out last week.

573
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:53,043
Maybe she was taking the easy way out.

574
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:56,881
Maybe she was determined to fight it.
That doesn't mean she killed herself.

575
00:36:57,007 --> 00:36:58,632
I checked her cell phone records.

576
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,634
No text messages,
no suicide note.

577
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,052
Not everyone leaves a note.

578
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:07,683
I just got word. We will be debriefed
on our shooting incident In the morning.

579
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:09,810
OK, good.

580
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:13,230
We need to get our stories straight about
why we left the precinct at 12:30

581
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:16,066
and didn't get to Wald's apartment
until after 3:00.

582
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:19,778
We grabbed some lunch
and then we had a flat tire.

583
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:21,572
Flat tire it is.

584
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:23,532
You OK?

585
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:26,327
I've read Masuka's notes.

586
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:29,830
That, along with the autopsy reports,
leads me to believe that there's no reason

587
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,207
to keep Tarla's case open
as a murder investigation.

588
00:37:32,334 --> 00:37:35,294
Lieutenant, I think it's premature to close it.
Lundy has this theory...

589
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:38,130
You don't work for Lundy.
You're welcome to pursue this,

590
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,674
but between the Vacation Murders
and Lisa Bell,

591
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,927
I think you're gonna be very busy.

592
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:45,930
You're on your own with this one.

593
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:48,098
Poor Cody.

594
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:50,267
Ouch.

595
00:37:51,353 --> 00:37:54,313
- Where'd the glass come from?
- That car on Elliot's lawn.

596
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:58,275
Cody was coming back from their pool
and he stepped on a piece.

597
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,818
Does it need stitches?

598
00:37:59,945 --> 00:38:01,612
No, he's fine, he's just scared.

599
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:03,405
First his bike, now this.

600
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:07,409
Poor guy.
Give him a hug for me.

601
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:11,956
Hi.

602
00:38:12,082 --> 00:38:13,707
Help me out here, Dexter.

603
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:16,126
I've been going out of my way
to make things good with you,

604
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:19,713
but no matter what I do,
you just throw it back in my face.

605
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,508
You don't need to
make things good with me.

606
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:25,386
Come on,
what's it gonna take?

607
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:27,888
Quinn...

608
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:30,766
I don't care if you're a dirty cop.

609
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:36,271
If I didn't take that money, it would just
sit inside a locker until some fatass

610
00:38:36,398 --> 00:38:39,984
who sits behind a desk grabs it to buy new
carpet for his office which he never leaves.

611
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,735
I put my life on the line every day.

612
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,320
I give this job everything I've got,

613
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,489
and I can't even afford
a down payment on a condo.

614
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:47,700
I thought you had family money.

615
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:51,578
Had, and that has nothing to do with
anything. Just don't fucking call me dirty.

616
00:38:51,705 --> 00:38:53,956
The last thing I need
is a cop mad at me.

617
00:38:57,669 --> 00:38:59,253
Look...

618
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:00,921
you're right, I take it all back.

619
00:39:02,132 --> 00:39:04,383
I honestly...

620
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:05,759
don't give a shit.

621
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:09,722
Just keep my sister out of it, OK?

622
00:39:11,558 --> 00:39:14,977
You don't understand
any of this, do you?

623
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:18,105
You can't,

624
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:20,232
'cause you're not a cop.

625
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,695
You're not one of us.

626
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:27,865
Cops, another community
I'm not part of.

627
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,219
What?

628
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:52,264
It's so crowded in there.

629
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,850
Well, I guess so.
A wife and three kids.

630
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,355
They're always there.

631
00:40:00,482 --> 00:40:01,648
Tell me about it.

632
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:05,611
It was easy living with Anton
when he was never home.

633
00:40:06,488 --> 00:40:07,988
I'd come back
to a quiet apartment

634
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:10,491
and unwind without having
to deal with anybody.

635
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:14,411
Now, as soon as I walk through the door,
he's there, waiting to engage.

636
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:15,913
There's no escape.

637
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:19,208
And now Lundy shows up.

638
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,878
Is that good or bad?

639
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:27,966
I have no fucking clue.

640
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:30,385
What?

641
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:34,598
We're complaining because
people want to be with us?

642
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:36,391
How lame is that?

643
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:41,105
You think Tarla Grant killed herself?

644
00:40:42,232 --> 00:40:43,899
No, I don't.

645
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,946
Masuka said she wasn't thrown
or pushed from the building.

646
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:53,117
She jumped.
What would make her do that?

647
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:57,287
Fear is a powerful motivator.

648
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:04,670
You should go inside.
You're home.

649
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:07,589
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

650
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:19,101
- Hi.
- Hi, sweetie.

651
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:20,352
Where is everybody?

652
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:21,937
I'm in here.

653
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:24,106
Fort Cody.

654
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:31,155
Hey, buddy, how's your foot?

655
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:32,656
It's better.

656
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:34,158
Good.

657
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:37,995
- Keep holding down the fort.
- OK.

658
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:42,499
And I'll take care of my end
once you guys go to sleep tonight.

659
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:45,085
You may want to talk to Astor.

660
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:52,342
This is one of those moments
when I wish I was like everyone else.

661
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:55,137
I'm sure other people
would know what to say.

662
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:02,811
Hey.

663
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:11,695
I know you're not
a little kid anymore.

664
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:12,988
Duh.

665
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,200
I'm sorry.

666
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,662
It's just...

667
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:22,456
sometimes I'm...

668
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,168
dumb.

669
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:34,843
It's OK.

670
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:39,848
You can be dumb.

671
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,354
Thanks.

672
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:05,874
What?

673
00:43:09,212 --> 00:43:10,879
It's funny.

674
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:13,924
A few months ago,
after a shoot-up like this,

675
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:16,927
people saw me leaning against you,
they wouldn't think twice.

676
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:20,597
They still wouldn't think twice.
They don't know anything about us.

677
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:21,890
I know.

678
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:25,227
But I think twice.

679
00:43:26,062 --> 00:43:30,232
I'm constantly worried that
people will misinterpret.

680
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:38,782
Let them misinterpret.

681
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:42,995
Hey...

682
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:46,498
I need this as much as you do.

683
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:52,754
This Dexter guy.

684
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,424
First of all, who the fuck
is named Dexter?

685
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:59,636
Oh, that feels good.

686
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:04,474
What, did his parents know he was gonna
grow up to be a fucking egghead?

687
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,144
I met him. He seems OK.

688
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:09,563
He's a lab geek.

689
00:44:09,689 --> 00:44:11,356
Fuck, that feels good.

690
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:15,110
What else?

691
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:18,530
What else? I'm exhausted.

692
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:23,869
I spent all afternoon in the sun
throwing dummies off a warehouse...

693
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:27,956
'cause super agent Lundy
has a hunch that

694
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:31,710
the dead woman is connected
to this big serial killer case.

695
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:32,919
Hmm, really?

696
00:44:33,046 --> 00:44:35,881
Oh, yeah.
Lundy always gets his man.

697
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:38,759
Yeah?

698
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:43,972
Well, so do I.

699
00:44:48,478 --> 00:44:50,812
This is where
I first noticed the pattern.

700
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:53,065
Raleigh, North Carolina, 1993.

701
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:55,359
That got you curious?

702
00:44:55,485 --> 00:44:58,195
Then I found
San Francisco, Louisville,

703
00:44:58,321 --> 00:45:00,572
Detroit, Richmond.

704
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:03,700
Eight different cities in all
that I know of.

705
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:05,869
Never the same place twice.

706
00:45:05,995 --> 00:45:07,496
Until now.

707
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:11,917
Ready for another?

708
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:13,752
Oh. Yeah.

709
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:20,801
So now this is your
little retirement project?

710
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:24,471
You're completely incapable
of relaxing, aren't you?

711
00:45:24,597 --> 00:45:27,641
That's just it.
This is how I relax.

712
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:31,561
I get the scent of a bad guy,
I can feel my blood pressure go down.

713
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:33,105
And I thought I was bad.

714
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:34,356
You are.

715
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:38,735
You're exactly the same as me,

716
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:42,197
just... in a much prettier package.

717
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:45,992
Are you flirting with me, Agent Lundy?

718
00:45:47,537 --> 00:45:49,496
Simply stating the truth, miss.

719
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:04,094
Thank you.

720
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:09,182
Excuse me just a second.

721
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:12,686
Hey.

722
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:16,773
Hey, so, um, you want me
to order some takeout?

723
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:22,070
Uh... I'm still working,
so I'll just grab something here.

724
00:46:22,989 --> 00:46:25,949
OK, well, I love you, babe.

725
00:46:26,868 --> 00:46:28,743
Me too.

726
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:45,635
Ah, Jesse, hard at work.
Big surprise.

727
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:55,395
I'm gonna wait in your room
and scare the shit out of you.

728
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,073
Jesse.

729
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,325
If you're in here...

730
00:47:21,464 --> 00:47:22,422
Andy!

731
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:26,009
Apparently I'm not the only one
who isn't exactly what he seems.

732
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:35,018
Is that the wrench
you use to break windows?

733
00:47:35,144 --> 00:47:36,478
- What the heck?
- Don't move.

734
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:39,773
OK, what's going on?
Who are you?

735
00:47:39,899 --> 00:47:43,527
You're gonna stop breaking things,
stop rolling cars down the street.

736
00:47:43,653 --> 00:47:45,862
Stop everything
you've been doing.

737
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:49,366
If you so much as touch another window,
I will come back here,

738
00:47:49,492 --> 00:47:52,202
and I will leave
with your head in a bag.

739
00:47:53,913 --> 00:47:55,330
I already have the bag.

740
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,087
Fuck you!

741
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,011
Let go of me,
you fucking asshole!

742
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:12,639
Fuck!

743
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,892
You really don't know
what you're doing here.

744
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:19,646
I know exactly what I want to fucking do,
piece of fucking shit.

745
00:48:19,772 --> 00:48:21,565
You should've seen their faces.

746
00:48:21,691 --> 00:48:27,070
Those boxes in their driveways
with their big fucking flat-screen TVs.

747
00:48:27,196 --> 00:48:29,406
"Oh, look at us,
aren't we so fucking rich?"

748
00:48:29,532 --> 00:48:30,490
Huh?

749
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:33,034
They're lucky the only thing I broke
was their fucking windows.

750
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,704
And you're lucky
I don't break your fucking neck.

751
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:38,373
- It's over.
- Fuck you, it's over.

752
00:48:43,713 --> 00:48:45,964
- Give up.
- No!

753
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:50,218
I played by the rules my entire life.
And look what it got me.

754
00:48:52,305 --> 00:48:54,973
My wife's dead.
I lost my job.

755
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:56,766
My son hates me. And now...

756
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:01,104
The bank wants
to take my house away.

757
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:03,607
So if you want to take
my fucking head, you take it.

758
00:49:03,733 --> 00:49:07,527
I said stop! You want me to come back
for your son's head too?

759
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:09,029
What? No!

760
00:49:09,155 --> 00:49:10,447
Not my boy!

761
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:14,034
It's all I have!

762
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:20,957
You're gonna save what's left of your family,
save what's left of yourself.

763
00:49:22,585 --> 00:49:24,377
Because all that other stuff...

764
00:49:25,254 --> 00:49:26,421
is over.

765
00:49:28,257 --> 00:49:29,424
Say it.

766
00:49:30,426 --> 00:49:32,427
Yeah, it's over.

767
00:49:40,645 --> 00:49:43,229
Bad news for Andy
is he's lost his house.

768
00:49:43,356 --> 00:49:45,523
Good news for me is
he'll be out of the neighborhood.

769
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:48,526
But why should I care about him?
It's his world.

770
00:49:48,653 --> 00:49:50,737
People like him made it this way.

771
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:53,448
At least he had a chance to belong.

772
00:50:03,042 --> 00:50:05,043
It's still there, Dex.

773
00:50:05,169 --> 00:50:08,004
A stain so deep
it can't be erased.
