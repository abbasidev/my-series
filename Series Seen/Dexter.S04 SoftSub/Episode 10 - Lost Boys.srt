1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,544
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:03,671 --> 00:00:06,047
Bathtub, jumper, bludgeon.

3
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:08,383
Lundy came to Miami to hunt this guy.

4
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:12,428
I think he got too close,
and I think it got him killed and me shot.

5
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:15,723
I can't even imagine
looking into the eyes of the person you love,

6
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,433
watching as he takes his last breath.

7
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,560
How much did you tell Christine
about the Lundy shooting?

8
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:22,522
I learned my lesson. I never even took
the Lundy files out of the station.

9
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:24,023
There's no way she could've seen it.

10
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,733
How did she know that?

11
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,193
How tall was my shooter?

12
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:31,781
- My height.
- Then it wasn't Trinity.

13
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:34,242
Look, I know it's really tough
for reporters right now,

14
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:37,453
so maybe I can give you that interview
you've been wanting from me.

15
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:39,914
I'm married.

16
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,041
- We have this connection.
- I have Dexter.

17
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:44,877
That smudge you found at the crime scene,

18
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:48,423
how do you think he got
the ashes to stick to the wall?

19
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:50,091
We got the killer's goddamn DNA?

20
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:52,301
- Going out of town?
- Yeah, on a Four Walls build.

21
00:00:52,428 --> 00:00:55,096
An out-of-town build?
Is his cycle starting over again?

22
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:59,726
This is where it all started.
Vera saw me.

23
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:02,937
I startled her and she slipped,
shattered the shower doors.

24
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,772
The glass sliced her leg.

25
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,066
She was dead by the time
the ambulance came.

26
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,277
Don't touch my sister!

27
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,362
Fuck you and fuck Vera!

28
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:16,159
Get the fuck off him!

29
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:20,413
I should've fucking killed you
when I had the chance.

30
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,501
Hi, Dad.

31
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,910
A hypodermic needle.

32
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:26,080
The perfect drug delivery system.

33
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,667
Rapid. Efficient.

34
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:32,253
Especially in the right hands.

35
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,799
So how's everyone doing over there?

36
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:41,053
Honey, I know.
Everything's gonna be OK.

37
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,763
Are you OK?

38
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,600
Well, I'm not the one
getting four booster shots.

39
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,143
I don't know how you're
not a complete wreck.

40
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:48,686
Serial killer, remember?

41
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:52,356
Well, a little pain now
means a lot less later on.

42
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:53,608
I should know.

43
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:56,444
I had my chance to eliminate
Arthur early on.

44
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,945
I didn't and now...

45
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,655
We ready?

46
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,035
OK, buddy, look at Daddy.

47
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:13,127
I know, I know, I know.

48
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,463
All right, that's one down.
Three more to go.

49
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:19,383
The good news is,
he won't remember any of this.

50
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:27,558
I didn't remember what happened
to me as a child...

51
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,814
until I was forced to.

52
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:40,988
Keeping my tools in a shipping container
makes more sense than a backyard shed.

53
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:45,242
After all, it's where
my dark passenger was born.

54
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,708
And, after tonight,
it's where Arthur Mitchell will call home.

55
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,093
Arthur is a man of ritual, like me.

56
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:05,262
Gas up the car,
a quick stop at Starbucks,

57
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:06,681
choir practice...

58
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:10,393
That's where I'm going to take him, when
he's alone in the parking lot of his church.

59
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,897
Wait. Why isn't he stopping?

60
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,390
Scott, hold your sister's hand
until we're inside.

61
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,642
You're not my mother.

62
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,981
If Arthur thinks he can lose me in a crowd,
he's dead wrong.

63
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:03,487
"Nick, Barb, Scott...

64
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,161
"Abby."

65
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,489
I know that look.

66
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,996
I'm not the only one on a stalk.

67
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:58,084
But it's too soon. Arthur just finished
his last kill cycle.

68
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:01,837
By saving his life,
have I set it all in motion again?

69
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:31,617
Where'd you go?

70
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,001
Scott, I'm Officer Carney.

71
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,130
Am... Am I in trouble?

72
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:45,381
No, no.

73
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:52,221
Are your mom and dad Nick and Barb?

74
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:54,682
Yes.

75
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,892
I'm afraid they've been in a car accident.

76
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,060
Are they OK?

77
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,855
They're gonna be fine,
but they've asked me to take you

78
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,023
to go see them in the hospital.

79
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,609
- We have to go get my sister.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

80
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,487
My partner's got Abby
in our patrol car.

81
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,281
Come on.

82
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,784
I'm just glad I found you.

83
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,724
It wasn't the baby-sitter he was after.

84
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,393
- This isn't a police car.
- I work undercover.

85
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,228
Wait, where's my sister?

86
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:44,023
Well, let me radio in
and see where my partner is.

87
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:50,446
Arthur!

88
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,215
Shit.

89
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,722
Kyle, I don't appreciate being followed.

90
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:18,807
Arthur, what are you doing?

91
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:20,935
I don't know what you think you saw,

92
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:24,521
but I promise I'll preserve
this boy's innocence.

93
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:26,440
I'm calling the police.

94
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:30,152
If I so much as see a police car,
the boy pays the price.

95
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,863
You like protecting children, don't you?

96
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,823
Like my son.

97
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,534
Arthur, just pull over. Tell me where you are.

98
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:41,956
I have a process. As long as it's not
interrupted, I'll set the boy free.

99
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,917
Arthur, don't do this. Let the boy go.

100
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:49,255
Dexter, he's gonna kill that child.

101
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:52,549
- He's never taken a child before.
- That you know of.

102
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:55,427
If this is new, this is on you.

103
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:58,973
Not if I find him first.

104
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,147
- Mr. Butler?
- Where's your mother?

105
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:11,151
She's picking up Rebecca from ballet,
but she'll be back any minute.

106
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,821
- I really don't think that you...
- Jonah, don't talk.

107
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,532
Just listen and answer.
Do you have any idea where your father is?

108
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,993
He's at some teaching thing up in Naples.

109
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,537
- How long?
- A couple days.

110
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:23,497
A couple of days. Good.

111
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:27,126
If Arthur's process takes that long,
the boy still has time.

112
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:34,633
You know, it's like
Thanksgiving never happened.

113
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,302
Except for this.

114
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,180
Why are you still here?

115
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:43,017
I can't leave my mom
and sister alone with him,

116
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,476
and my mom won't leave, so I'm fucked.

117
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,520
Look, I need to find your dad, and fast.

118
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,106
- I need your help.
- Don't you understand?

119
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:52,693
The longer he's gone,
the better, for all of us.

120
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,321
Jonah, we both know what he's capable of.

121
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,036
Did... Did he hurt someone else?

122
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,204
I hope not.
That's why I need to find him,

123
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:08,500
to keep him from doing
something really wrong.

124
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:13,839
You have the chance
to finally break the cycle.

125
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:17,134
What do you want me to do?

126
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,554
Go through his desk,
journals, computer.

127
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,098
Anything, everything.
Find out what he's been working on.

128
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,558
He'd kill me.

129
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,685
I'll make sure he never finds out.

130
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,272
You know, I...

131
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:33,067
I'm... I'm not sure if I can...
If I can do it.

132
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,361
That's my mom and Rebecca.

133
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:38,739
There is a great big shit-ugly
world out there, Jonah.

134
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:42,242
The bad stuff doesn't just end
at your doorstep.

135
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:45,162
You can help put an end to all of it.

136
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:48,248
- To all of what?
- The sins of your father.

137
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:51,752
Help me, Jonah.

138
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,233
Where am I?

139
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,116
What is this place?

140
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,118
Do you like trains, Arthur?

141
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,830
My name isn't Arthur. It's Scott.

142
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,923
Look at that.

143
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,051
It's a thing of beauty.

144
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,936
I want my mom and dad.

145
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:56,817
Whoo-whoo!

146
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,736
Choo-choo-choo-choo-choo
choo-choo-choo-choo

147
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:03,490
Choo-choo-choo-choo
choo-choo-choo.

148
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,410
Whoo-whoo!

149
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:12,791
If Arthur's ritual, like mine,
was born in the past,

150
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:17,212
the past is where I'll find him.

151
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,969
His last cycle of kills
took place in New Orleans.

152
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:32,102
Matthew Hicks, ten years old,

153
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,605
went to the local pool, never came home.

154
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:38,317
Five days before a woman
was found murdered in her bathtub.

155
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,319
Before?

156
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,537
You always did have a soft spot for kids.

157
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:55,292
They remind you of what you lost that day
in the shipping container.

158
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,294
Innocence.

159
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:01,381
Arthur said that's what he would preserve
in the boy he took.

160
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:06,803
If each of Arthur's victims
represents members of his family,

161
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:10,098
- then the boy...
- Must be Arthur himself.

162
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:13,393
He was ten when his sister died.

163
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,814
Omaha, another ten-year-old
goes missing.

164
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:24,029
Five days later, another bathtub murder.

165
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:26,573
St. Paul.

166
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,789
Denver.

167
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,751
Lundy misread the pattern.

168
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:42,422
It's not three victims
he leaves behind, it's four.

169
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:46,051
Lundy didn't think to look
at missing children because...

170
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,514
they were never recorded as homicides.

171
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,309
Which means five days before the Lisa Bell
bathtub murder here in Miami...

172
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,115
another ten-year-old went missing.

173
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:12,035
My God.
The boys begin the cycle.

174
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:19,459
Hey.

175
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,295
Sorry. Working late.

176
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,463
Like always.

177
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,299
Is everything OK?

178
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:29,261
Harrison isn't sleeping,
so I'm gonna keep him in our bed tonight.

179
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,680
I'll be there in a sec.

180
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,808
OK.

181
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,281
Arthur could have that boy anywhere,

182
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:52,492
and now there'll be an army of police
and volunteers surrounding his parents

183
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:54,703
to help find their son.

184
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,790
I need to be one of them.

185
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:05,839
If Arthur picked this particular boy
for a reason, I need to know.

186
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,841
Come in.

187
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,718
Hey, Dex, you wanted to see me?

188
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:12,929
- Gordy, thanks for coming.
- Yeah, sure, no sweat. What's up?

189
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:15,974
I dinged a parked van last night,

190
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,437
and I left a note,
but the driver hasn't called me back.

191
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:22,481
And I'm thinking, after I totaled my car,

192
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:25,025
I can't afford to let the insurance companies
get involved.

193
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:28,403
You think you can do a stake and notify
so I can find this guy, pay him in cash?

194
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:32,074
Yeah, sure. Just, uh, give me the plate,
and if patrol spots your van,

195
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,494
- I'll give you a heads-up on its location.
- Perfect.

196
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,874
Hold on. As soon as he's done
with the uni, I'm next.

197
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,543
- Next for what?
- I have to talk to him.

198
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,045
He's right in there.

199
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,799
I'm still figuring out... how to phrase it.

200
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,468
How gay are you?

201
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,303
Look, I...

202
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,890
I saw something at Thanksgiving
I wish I hadn't.

203
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,980
- Morgan.
- Gordon.

204
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:12,030
Jesus, ever hear of a comb?
It looks like you have a cat on your head.

205
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,908
I'm kind of on a mission here.
What's up?

206
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,078
I've got that interview
with Quinn's squeeze today.

207
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,579
Christine?

208
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:24,751
Are you sure it's a good idea
to dredge up all that Lundy stuff?

209
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,753
Actually, I've got a few questions for her.

210
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,922
I think she might have some ideas
about who shot him.

211
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,633
The real question is,
do I give Quinn a heads-up...

212
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:35,387
- No, you don't. I gotta go.
- Just no? He's my partner.

213
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:39,182
Yeah, he's also her boyfriend.
You don't know where his loyalties are.

214
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:42,269
- Deb, I've got field work I gotta do.
- Yeah, and I've got a briefing on Trinity

215
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,312
in, like, two minutes. My case.

216
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:45,689
I need your big brain, bro.

217
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:48,150
- There's no new blood. There's no need.
- No way.

218
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:51,403
You do realize I will stand here
all fucking morning.

219
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,114
If Trinity works in the public school system

220
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,534
and we can't get the OK to swab these guys,
we are beyond boned.

221
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,745
If he's even in the school system.

222
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:01,955
Sorry, Deb, but the sooner this is over,

223
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,291
the sooner I get to
that missing boy's parents.

224
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:08,462
We've had better luck with private schools
and so far we're looking at 240 males

225
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,630
who fit our Trinity profile.

226
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,299
Collect their samples
and get them to Masuka.

227
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,676
Oh, wonderful.
More old man spit.

228
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:17,220
Dexter, I need the blood evidence
in that bar stabbing.

229
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,430
I'm proofing it.

230
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:21,808
Proof faster. Prelim's tomorrow.
Where are we on the Lundy shooting?

231
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:25,395
I'm still on the foreign nationals
that were staying at the hotel.

232
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,981
So no significant developments.

233
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:31,401
When you say it like that, no.

234
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,070
OK.

235
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:43,163
Hey, uh, Dex, you got a minute?
It's about Thanksgiving.

236
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,165
Later, Vince.

237
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,125
Uh...

238
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,294
OK.

239
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,923
Uh, Lieutenant, could you
authorize this requisition?

240
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:57,344
Could it be so wrong if you and I hopped
on the first plane to an island somewhere?

241
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,013
Yes, and this isn't a requisition.

242
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,681
- It's a Thai menu.
- Mm-hm.

243
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,850
Thank you for bringing that
to my attention, Sergeant.

244
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,269
Start at community colleges,
work our way up?

245
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,688
- Detectives.
- Babe?

246
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:11,316
Keep it in your pants. She's here to see me.

247
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:13,026
Oh, you're finally doing the interview?

248
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:16,196
- She is persistent.
- Tell me about it.

249
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:19,699
And when I'm done, everyone in Miami
is gonna know what a true hero is.

250
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:23,161
Don't forget your partner.
That's Quinn with two Ns.

251
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:26,248
Oh, shit, I forgot to run something by
Batista. Will you show her to the box?

252
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:29,000
- I'll be there in two seconds?
- Yeah.

253
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:36,800
I need you to watch Christine interview me.

254
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,885
And I would do that why?

255
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,763
This could have something
to do with the Lundy shooting.

256
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,683
- No significant developments, remember?
- OK.

257
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,526
I'm hungry.

258
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:59,865
Well, why don't you put your pajamas on
and we'll have something to eat.

259
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,661
No, I won't do it.

260
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,830
I won't do anything you tell me to.

261
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,428
Don't you understand?

262
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:26,349
Father drinks,
and Mother pays the price.

263
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:32,689
I'm just trying to protect you, Arthur.

264
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,483
My name is Scott!

265
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,406
Very well.

266
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:56,922
- Mr. Smith.
- Yes.

267
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:59,090
I'm Dexter Morgan, Miami Metro.

268
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,927
I'm not here in any official capacity.

269
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:05,972
I just want to do anything I can
to help find your missing son.

270
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,475
We haven't set up phone banks yet,

271
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:12,145
but, uh, we have some flyers.

272
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,731
- May I take some with me?
- Great.

273
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:25,158
I'm the only one here
who knows what happened.

274
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:29,537
I could point the police
in Arthur Mitchell's direction.

275
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:31,998
But the slightest misstep on their part

276
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,793
ensures this family is never whole again.

277
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:41,883
Is there any information at all on your son?

278
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,885
A tip, a lead, a phone call?

279
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,971
Anything that could point me
in a direction?

280
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:50,308
None. I keep waiting for... a ransom note.

281
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,143
Something.

282
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:54,145
I'd better go post these.

283
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:58,525
I'm gonna do everything I can
to help you get your son back.

284
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,777
Thank you.

285
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:06,866
Can you imagine walking by
your kid's empty bedroom,

286
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:08,201
not knowing where he is?

287
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,996
No. I can't.

288
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:17,377
How does a guy like this make a dead body
just disappear into thin air?

289
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:19,963
The Gulf Stream does the trick for me.

290
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:23,633
But there's no ocean in Omaha,
Des Moines, St. Paul, or Denver.

291
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,511
The Four Walls houses.

292
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:31,016
He goes to each one of those cities
on a build as a pretext for his killing cycle.

293
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:34,728
Construction site would be a convenient
place to bury a body.

294
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,896
Or to hold a boy captive.

295
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:42,652
Three years on patrol,

296
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,404
two years in Vice.

297
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,532
Why Homicide?

298
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:52,579
- My dad was a detective here.
- Hmm.

299
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:55,290
But it was completely different
being a cop back then.

300
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:59,210
Yeah, I bet. Talk about your man's world.

301
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,796
Oh, no, no, it wasn't just that.

302
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:06,092
I think you had to rely more
on your instincts back then.

303
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:10,930
There wasn't all this forensics stuff
to lean on to break a case.

304
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:13,058
Back then, you had to rely on your gut.

305
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,393
Amen to that.

306
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,317
Have you seen these?

307
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,284
Forensically, we're at a dead end
with the Lundy case,

308
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:36,247
so I just stare at these, looking for answers.

309
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,256
You know what?

310
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:50,220
I've got enough background info.

311
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,224
How about I just write this up
and give you a call

312
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:58,520
if, uh, we didn't cover everything?

313
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:00,480
Sure.

314
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,485
Can I ask you something?

315
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:08,071
- You live over in the Gables, right?
- Yeah.

316
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:12,200
Wow, that must be really nice,
being away from all that touristy stuff.

317
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:14,702
Well, I got lucky.
Found a great building.

318
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:16,871
Yeah, so the Gables, that's what, like, uh,

319
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:20,667
60 minutes from the hotel
where Frank was staying?

320
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,502
- I guess.
- Wow.

321
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:25,630
You sure got to the crime scene fast.

322
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:30,510
There's no traffic at 5 a.m.

323
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:31,845
Oh, I know that.

324
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:35,515
But dispatch didn't
put out the call till 5:05.

325
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:38,977
You were the first reporter on scene at 5:20.

326
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:45,692
I like to roll out of bed
and hit the gym early.

327
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:48,319
I was on my way there
when I heard the scanner.

328
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:51,197
Bullshit. She's lying.

329
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,287
Um, how do I get out of here?

330
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:04,836
You just follow the windows
till you get to the elevator.

331
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:24,439
We've got to tread
very, very lightly with it. If Quinn...

332
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:27,150
No shit. That's why I'm asking you
to help me sort through this.

333
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:29,068
- Tell me I'm not crazy.
- You're not crazy.

334
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:32,071
I spoke to Christine
at your crime scene.

335
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:33,823
Hair made, full makeup.

336
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,950
No way she rolled out of bed
at 5 a.m. looking like that.

337
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:38,494
I'm telling you she knows more
than she's letting on.

338
00:25:38,621 --> 00:25:42,248
She's a hard-boiled crime scene reporter,
and she couldn't even look at those photos.

339
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,335
Suspicious, but it doesn't prove a thing.

340
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:49,923
Well, there's something else.
I know it sounds weird, but the other day,

341
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:54,969
she was talking to me about how I was
looking in Lundy's eyes when he died.

342
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,930
How does she know he didn't die instantly?

343
00:25:57,056 --> 00:26:00,183
LaGuerta got Broward County school district
to let us collect samples.

344
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:03,436
- Still working on Dade.
- Great.

345
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:04,771
Everything OK?

346
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:07,273
Yeah. Great.

347
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,942
Be right there.

348
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:10,944
Great.

349
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:14,447
We can't be doing this with Quinn around.

350
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:15,698
Thank you.

351
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,127
Build's nearly finished.

352
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:30,255
No one's here.

353
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,183
They're not here.

354
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:45,645
Fuck!

355
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:49,440
Hello?

356
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:52,819
Kyle, I went through my dad's desk.
You know, there's nothing here.

357
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:54,320
What about his computer?

358
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:57,448
I already looked.
There's... It's just school stuff.

359
00:26:57,574 --> 00:27:00,702
Look at the search history.
Does anything stand out?

360
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:03,997
OK, OK, OK. One sec, one sec.

361
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:08,001
Nothing, really.
We got some Bible stuff.

362
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:12,088
A hardware store. A real-estate agency,
the local paper...

363
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:14,090
The real-estate site.
What was he looking at?

364
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:16,009
Uh, let's see.

365
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:19,637
It's just a bunch of homes for sale.

366
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:23,349
An empty house. Good place to ensure
his process isn't disturbed.

367
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:27,603
I can email you the list if you want.

368
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:28,855
I don't have email.

369
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:31,190
Who doesn't have email, Kyle?

370
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:33,651
Off the top of my head,
people who don't exist.

371
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:36,863
Fax them to the Kinko's near your house
under my name. I'll pick them up there.

372
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,197
OK.

373
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:40,491
Jonah, you're doing the right thing.

374
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:42,785
You know, how...

375
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:46,873
How come you're the only one
who can see my dad for what he is?

376
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:49,125
We have a few things in common.

377
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,673
Police are searching for a North
Miami boy who went missing last night.

378
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:58,217
Ten-year-old Scott Smith
was in an arcade with his sister

379
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:00,511
and their nanny at around 7:45 p.m.

380
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:04,557
when the nanny, Susan Peterson, realized
that Scott was no longer at her side.

381
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,893
Fight! Fight! Fight!

382
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:09,062
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

383
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:11,147
Cody?

384
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:13,066
- Let go.
- Let go of him, Cody.

385
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:15,485
Cody! Cody, come here.
Cody, what are you doing?

386
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:17,904
He said he saw Dexter leave
the Young Sailors camp-out

387
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,365
in the middle of the night
cos he was scared, so I hit him.

388
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:22,742
I'm so sorry. Boys, huh?

389
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:26,537
If my son said that's what he saw,
I believe him.

390
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,164
Come on.

391
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:45,765
Why, hello.

392
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:48,768
I'm so glad I finally got you.

393
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:51,187
Actually, I'm in the middle of a project.

394
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:53,314
Dad, I really need to see you.

395
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,983
You just did. Thanksgiving night.

396
00:28:57,611 --> 00:29:00,863
I can't wait another
four months until my birthday.

397
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:05,701
Can we meet in between
our usual visits? Just this once?

398
00:29:05,828 --> 00:29:09,288
There's a reason why we only see each
other a couple of times a year, Christine.

399
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:12,583
I have a full life
and a family who needs me.

400
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:16,087
I'm your family too.

401
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:20,258
I need you. More than they do.

402
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:23,386
Sorry, sweetie, it'll have to wait.

403
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:24,512
Love you.

404
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:28,349
I think I'm in trouble.

405
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,271
Dad?

406
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:05,595
So, are you gonna let me go?

407
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,265
In due time, Arthur.

408
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,477
Why do you keep calling me that?

409
00:30:29,203 --> 00:30:30,578
Is that food for me?

410
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:33,706
You can have something to eat...

411
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,710
once you put your pajamas on, Arthur.

412
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:51,140
Oh, this is delicious.

413
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:28,761
So far I've looked at
six empty houses on Jonah's list.

414
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:34,392
This one... not so empty.

415
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:45,695
Hey.

416
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:47,863
Dexter, are you on your way home?

417
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,741
Just finishing up a few things.

418
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,535
Oh. The baby has a fever.

419
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:54,537
How long do you think you're gonna be?

420
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:56,038
Not very.

421
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,624
There's still another house
I can check on the way home.

422
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:29,155
Scott?

423
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:30,573
Scott Smith?

424
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,917
Me and my kids got nowhere else to be.

425
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:44,920
My babies just need a place
to feel safe at night.

426
00:32:45,047 --> 00:32:47,214
We don't make a mess or nothin'.

427
00:32:47,341 --> 00:32:49,425
You ain't gonna tell?

428
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:52,845
No.

429
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:55,556
No, I won't.

430
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:05,983
Shh.

431
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:08,110
Thank God.

432
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,196
Hey, can you take him?

433
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:11,739
Yeah.

434
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:15,701
Oh, he's so warm.

435
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,079
Yeah. Those shots really
did a number on him.

436
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:20,790
Can you take his temperature again?
The thermometer's on the counter.

437
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:22,875
You're late. Big day?

438
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,877
Yeah, I was helping out
with that missing boy.

439
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:28,589
Oh, that's so sweet. Those poor parents.

440
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:32,051
Speaking of which, Paul's folks called.

441
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:35,346
They want to take the kids
to Disney World one weekend.

442
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:38,557
You sure that's a good idea?
I've never even met them.

443
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:40,059
They're nothing like Paul.

444
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:42,186
He was the abusive black sheep
of the family.

445
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:46,148
Plus, I think it would be good
for Cody right now.

446
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,531
What happened to his eye?

447
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:57,660
One of the Young Sailors said you
disappeared the night of the camping trip.

448
00:33:57,786 --> 00:33:59,245
Cody was defending your honor.

449
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:02,581
Huh!

450
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:07,753
The only time I left my tent that night
was to find a tree.

451
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,381
Well, Cody doesn't want to be
part of the group anymore.

452
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:13,509
He said he doesn't want to be
around somebody who tells lies.

453
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:14,760
Too late.

454
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,180
100.1.

455
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:21,267
Oy. You mind giving him
a sponge bath, cool him off?

456
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:24,186
- Food will be ready when you're done.
- OK.

457
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:28,607
This is so frustrating.
None of it makes any fucking sense.

458
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:33,487
What if Christine was covering for a source
that knew something about this?

459
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,741
Possibly.

460
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:44,457
I couldn't even look Quinn in the eye.

461
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:48,294
Don't worry.
We're gonna figure this out.

462
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,796
We just gotta think outside the box.

463
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:53,591
How's this for outside the box?

464
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:56,802
Christine's the same height
as the shooter.

465
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:06,437
Christine shoots Lundy. Why?

466
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:15,321
Beats the motherfuck out of me.
She doesn't have a record.

467
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:16,530
You ran her prints?

468
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:20,659
After the interview, I lifted them off
some pictures I got her to pick up.

469
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:25,414
Maybe she has priors that
she hasn't been nailed on.

470
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:29,293
We get her DNA,
we check it against the database.

471
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:34,298
You and I both know we don't have enough
to get a warrant.

472
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:36,842
Think outside the box, Sergeant.

473
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,893
Nothing like clean, cool water,
huh, big guy?

474
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,355
You'll be as good as new in no time.

475
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:51,482
But will I?

476
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:54,944
I killed an innocent man
when I left the campsite that night.

477
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:58,322
Now Rita and Cody have been
drawn into defending a lie.

478
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:00,199
My lie.

479
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:05,913
Trinity's not the only one
using his family as human shields.

480
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:09,041
Are you out of your fucking mind?

481
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:12,294
No way Christine had anything
to do with shooting you or Lundy!

482
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,464
You've been dating her for what, two
months? How well do you even know her?

483
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,676
Is this some Morgan vendetta against me?
Is your asshole brother behind this?

484
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:21,470
Why the fuck would my brother
have anything to do with this?

485
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,973
Forget it. It...

486
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:27,977
Look, you're probably right
about Christine,

487
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:30,104
and I am totally off-base,

488
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,731
but you're a cop, and a good one,
and I know you know what it's like

489
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:35,150
when you have a hunch.

490
00:36:35,277 --> 00:36:37,111
Who else knows about this?

491
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:40,072
Batista.

492
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,825
Great. Make me look
like a fucking asshole.

493
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:44,910
Don't make this about you.

494
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:48,539
Does she keep a toothbrush here?

495
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:53,210
Christine will never know about this.

496
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:58,507
And when the results come back clean, you
can shove this up my ass anytime you want.

497
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:03,554
I need you to get a DNA panel
on this ASAP.

498
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:06,015
That's your emergency?

499
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:10,144
Project Runway is on.

500
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:11,896
Fuck you.

501
00:37:12,022 --> 00:37:15,316
- I'll owe you one, all right?
- Who's it belong to?

502
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:18,485
We may have a big fucking lead
on the Lundy case, and...

503
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:21,989
Just fucking run it.

504
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:38,255
Six houses down, another eight to go,
and I'm running out of time.

505
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:43,677
Morgan.

506
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,721
Dexter, where the hell are you?

507
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:48,474
En route. Traffic.

508
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,518
OK, well, the DA's all over me
about that blood report.

509
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:55,648
I'll have it on your desk in half an hour.

510
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:07,910
- What?
- I was just thinking.

511
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:11,288
Christmas is coming up.
You got any plans?

512
00:38:12,874 --> 00:38:15,751
- You and me.
- What about your family?

513
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:20,297
Hmm. We're not that close.

514
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:23,592
I guess that's why
you never talk about them.

515
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,511
Have you seen my toothbrush?

516
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:29,473
Oh, the cleaning lady must have
thrown it out by mistake.

517
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,642
She's jealous of my perfect teeth.

518
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:33,769
Here. Brand-new.

519
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:39,191
Are you OK?

520
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,818
Yeah.

521
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,529
Yeah?

522
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:45,614
Are you sure?

523
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,242
Now's not a good time.

524
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:57,126
Well, maybe it is a good time for me.
You ever consider that?

525
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:01,005
Wow. Um...

526
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:05,342
This is about your partner, isn't it?
Did she say something to you?

527
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:06,885
About what?

528
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:12,433
She gave a shitty interview.
I'm ditching the article.

529
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:16,437
- So you think she's pissed about that?
- I don't know. It doesn't matter.

530
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:18,355
I'm gonna be late for work.

531
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:27,781
Daddy, I can't wait.
I need to see you now.

532
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,992
We might be in trouble.

533
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,538
We have to talk about, uh...

534
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:43,047
that woman in the bathtub that night
when I was little.

535
00:39:44,174 --> 00:39:45,841
Please call me back. Please.

536
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:57,144
Now what'll we call this station?

537
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,729
Why can't I go home?

538
00:39:58,855 --> 00:40:02,608
Northern Springs? Rainbow Valley?

539
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:06,779
How about, uh, Copper Flats?

540
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:13,410
This is stupid!

541
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,247
You should take me home.

542
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:19,083
I want to see my mom and dad.

543
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:35,474
♪ Venus, make her fair

544
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:39,311
♪ A lovely girl with sunlight in her hair

545
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:43,065
♪ And take the brightest stars
up in the skies

546
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:46,568
♪ And place them in her eyes for me ♪

547
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:01,458
Why are you so sad?

548
00:41:04,254 --> 00:41:06,296
It was Vera's favorite song.

549
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,634
She was my sister.

550
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,680
What happened to her?

551
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:19,518
She died.

552
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:23,147
It wasn't my fault.

553
00:41:23,273 --> 00:41:25,524
It wasn't my fault!

554
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:35,659
Listen.

555
00:41:35,785 --> 00:41:38,537
Uh, I'm sorry about your sister.

556
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:45,919
And if it'll make you feel any better,
you can call me Arthur.

557
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:52,009
You'd let me do that?

558
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:54,469
Sure.

559
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:58,390
Now how about we play trains
a little bit more

560
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:01,185
and then you can take me home?

561
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:14,865
You're a dear boy, Arthur.

562
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:16,742
So innocent.

563
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:19,786
Kind-hearted.

564
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:23,207
Promise me you'll always stay that way.

565
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:26,418
Sure.

566
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:33,258
Do you like ice cream?

567
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:59,326
After you've, uh, finished your treat...

568
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:05,123
I think it's time to let you go free.

569
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:25,102
Yeah, I'm calling about the house on Olive.

570
00:43:25,228 --> 00:43:27,980
Yeah, I'm sure
the curbside appeal is great,

571
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:30,857
but I need to know, is the house occupied?

572
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:35,112
Oh, the current owners
are still living there.

573
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:38,991
Great. Ah, that's OK.

574
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:40,701
No need for a drive-by.

575
00:43:40,827 --> 00:43:42,911
You stay blessed too.

576
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:45,539
Lieutenant, blood report
on the bar stabbing.

577
00:43:45,665 --> 00:43:48,667
Hey, Dexter, just got word
on that stake and notify.

578
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:51,503
We found your van
about 20 minutes ago.

579
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,797
It was at a diner on Flagler and Fourth.

580
00:43:53,923 --> 00:43:56,008
- Hope you find your guy.
- Me too.

581
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:00,887
If Arthur's van was spotted
close to where he has the boy,

582
00:44:01,014 --> 00:44:03,348
that should narrow
my search down considerably.

583
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,517
Fourth and Flagler.

584
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:08,645
Four listings in the area.

585
00:44:09,689 --> 00:44:13,358
Two within a mile.

586
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,737
Uh, hey, Dex...

587
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:19,865
- Where are you off to?
- Kill the guy you're looking for.

588
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:22,075
Save a kid.
Remember to pick up diapers.

589
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:24,369
I have to be two places at once.

590
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:25,704
Not a great day.

591
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:28,206
I hear you.

592
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:30,709
I'm half out of my mind
trying to crack this Lundy thing.

593
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:32,210
Debra Morgan!

594
00:44:33,338 --> 00:44:35,047
Fuck me twice on Sunday.
That's all I need.

595
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:36,673
Who's that?

596
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:39,217
One of dad's old fuck buddies.
Emphasis on old.

597
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:41,470
Harry's past is a minefield.

598
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:43,680
But I've got my own
ticking bomb to defuse.

599
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:45,515
Let me know what happens.

600
00:44:46,893 --> 00:44:48,602
What's up, Valerie?

601
00:44:48,728 --> 00:44:51,104
I'm sorry I said those things
about your father.

602
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:54,941
He dumped me for another CI,
and all this time, it still hurts.

603
00:44:55,068 --> 00:44:58,070
Do you happen to remember
this other woman's name?

604
00:44:58,196 --> 00:45:02,699
No, but I bet she'd remember me.
God, I was completely out of my mind.

605
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:05,035
Went to her house, confronted her.

606
00:45:05,161 --> 00:45:07,162
Valerie, I have to go. I will call you.

607
00:45:12,335 --> 00:45:14,669
So, um, pick you up later?

608
00:45:14,796 --> 00:45:16,588
Get a bottle of wine?

609
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:19,257
- You're...
- In love with a beautiful woman.

610
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:21,301
So shoot me.

611
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:23,804
Lieutenant.

612
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:27,099
The DNA results on Christine Hill are back.

613
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:29,643
She's fucking related to Trinity.

614
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:14,729
Bomb shelter.

615
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:42,007
1960s Miami.

616
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:44,009
Cuban Missile Crisis.

617
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:47,095
Irony is, places like this
were built to keep people safe.

618
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,930
I hate irony.

619
00:46:54,437 --> 00:46:54,978
They were here...

620
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:56,938
They were here...

621
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:59,316
and I just missed them.

622
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:11,995
I'm sorry, Daddy.

623
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:13,455
Thanks for meeting me.

624
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:16,041
I never told you because
I thought it was a dream.

625
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:17,667
And I wanted it to be, but it wasn't.

626
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:21,963
Now, now, now, now, now, slow down.
What are you talking about?

627
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:24,633
I saw you that night.

628
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:26,510
Back when I was five.

629
00:47:26,636 --> 00:47:28,386
You told me to stay in the car, but I didn't.

630
00:47:28,513 --> 00:47:31,640
So I got out and I went
into that woman's house.

631
00:47:33,726 --> 00:47:37,437
And I saw you in the bathtub with her.

632
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:39,523
The water was so red.

633
00:47:39,649 --> 00:47:41,274
It was a dream.

634
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:44,861
You were right the first time.

635
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,989
It wasn't.

636
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:53,036
I knew it wasn't when it happened again
in the same house 30 years later.

637
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:06,716
I couldn't figure this out in time.

638
00:48:09,554 --> 00:48:12,681
You'll have another shot at Arthur.
Isn't that what you want?

639
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:15,475
What if it was Harrison or Cody?

640
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:18,270
Your priorities have changed.

641
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:24,025
I'm a father now.

642
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:29,531
I went back and I looked through all
the postcards you sent me over the years.

643
00:48:29,657 --> 00:48:35,036
Every trip you took in every city you went,
a woman died in a bathtub.

644
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:39,583
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- It's all right. I protected you.

645
00:48:39,709 --> 00:48:42,627
That FBI agent? Lundy.

646
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:45,755
He was starting to get close,
but I stopped him.

647
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:51,886
I got in with the Homicide department
so I'd know what they knew.

648
00:48:52,013 --> 00:48:54,306
And I followed Lundy

649
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:55,974
and I saw you run into him.

650
00:48:56,100 --> 00:49:00,645
And he started putting things together,
and he was never gonna stop, so I shot him.

651
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:01,980
You what?

652
00:49:02,106 --> 00:49:03,315
It's OK.

653
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:06,443
I made it look like another crime spree.

654
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:09,529
The Vacation Murders.
The police had no idea.

655
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:11,072
Had?

656
00:49:12,825 --> 00:49:15,118
Well, they still don't have anything solid.

657
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:18,288
But they're starting to ask questions.

658
00:49:18,414 --> 00:49:20,248
No.

659
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:31,176
Dad.

660
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,929
You put yourself at risk...

661
00:49:36,057 --> 00:49:37,766
for me.

662
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:40,894
I'd do anything for you.

663
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:45,899
More than your other kids.
They would never do what I did for you.

664
00:49:46,025 --> 00:49:47,359
It's gonna be OK, baby.

665
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:50,654
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you, I promise you.

666
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:52,197
OK.

667
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:55,325
You've always been so special to me.

668
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:05,377
Dad.

669
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:07,962
Dad...

670
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:10,757
Now go home.

671
00:50:10,883 --> 00:50:11,966
No.

672
00:50:12,093 --> 00:50:14,302
I'll drop by tonight,

673
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,638
and we'll figure all of this out, OK?

674
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:20,058
Go on now.

675
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:22,686
It's gonna be fine.

676
00:50:43,207 --> 00:50:46,167
Stupid fucking cunt!

677
00:51:16,699 --> 00:51:18,950
No wonder none of those missing boys
has ever been found.

678
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:20,952
Encase a body in cement

679
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:23,163
and it's preserved forever.

680
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:26,499
The Four Walls build.

681
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:29,836
You were already there.
Arthur wasn't ready then.

682
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,006
He is now.

683
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:47,771
Burying a child in cement.
That's not very Christian.

684
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:52,817
No closer.

685
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:55,612
I'll take that to mean the boy is still alive.

686
00:51:55,738 --> 00:51:59,073
Walk away, Kyle.
This doesn't concern you.

687
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:01,785
There's no way I can do that.

688
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:03,703
I need to do this.

689
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:22,680
I can't stop this.

690
00:52:24,809 --> 00:52:26,100
I can.

691
00:52:57,258 --> 00:52:59,175
Alive.

692
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:16,317
Arthur!

693
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:27,370
Daddy.

694
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:10,872
Hey, you.

695
00:54:11,916 --> 00:54:13,791
Hey, you too.

696
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:22,550
- Long day?
- Oh...

697
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:24,844
The longest.

698
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:26,304
Mm.

699
00:54:28,724 --> 00:54:32,060
- Mm.
- They found that boy.

700
00:54:33,646 --> 00:54:36,689
Do the police have
any idea what happened?

701
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:40,318
If they do, they're not saying.

702
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:43,237
Those parents must be so relieved.

703
00:54:48,911 --> 00:54:50,912
Do you hear that?

704
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:56,751
Crickets.

705
00:54:58,796 --> 00:55:01,339
For once, the house is quiet.

706
00:55:02,591 --> 00:55:03,508
Mm.

707
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:08,638
Jinxed it.

708
00:55:08,764 --> 00:55:09,806
Hmm.

709
00:55:09,932 --> 00:55:12,892
- I got this. I got it.
- No, but you're so tired.

710
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:14,936
It's OK.

711
00:55:15,062 --> 00:55:17,313
I want to.

712
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:28,116
Yeah, it's OK, big guy.

713
00:55:28,242 --> 00:55:29,993
It's OK.

714
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:31,786
Mm.

715
00:55:34,498 --> 00:55:36,833
I'm sorry you're in pain.

716
00:55:40,129 --> 00:55:41,462
Yeah.

717
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:45,633
I promise you, no one's
ever gonna hurt you again.

718
00:55:53,267 --> 00:55:55,268
Especially me.
