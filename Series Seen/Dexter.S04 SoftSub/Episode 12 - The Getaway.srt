1
00:00:02,044 --> 00:00:03,544
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:03,671 --> 00:00:06,214
Dexter Morgan,
good suburban husband,

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,757
happy father of three.

4
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:09,258
Living the dream.

5
00:00:09,385 --> 00:00:10,677
Daddy kills people.

6
00:00:10,803 --> 00:00:12,970
It's always the same
three kills with Trinity -

7
00:00:13,097 --> 00:00:14,597
a young woman in a bathtub

8
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:16,766
followed by a mother
falling to her death

9
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:18,643
and ending with
a man getting bludgeoned.

10
00:00:20,396 --> 00:00:23,981
Trinity... He doesn't belong here.
It doesn't make sense.

11
00:00:24,108 --> 00:00:26,484
- Hi, honey.
- Trinity's a husband.

12
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,611
A father. He's...

13
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,071
like me.

14
00:00:31,407 --> 00:00:34,033
Lundy came to Miami to hunt this guy.

15
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:36,911
I think he got too close,
and I think it got him killed.

16
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,790
I need a partner, Dexter.
Someone I can trust.

17
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:43,084
Unless you can be
completely honest with me,

18
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,129
I don't want to do this anymore.

19
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:47,296
I'm married.

20
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:49,716
Stay the hell away from my wife.

21
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:51,759
There's only one person
who can help me.

22
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,302
- Arthur Mitchell.
- Kyle Butler.

23
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:56,013
Four Walls, One Heart.
We build homes for the homeless.

24
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:59,809
Still so much to learn
about handling the kids and the wife.

25
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:02,603
- Choose your weapon.
- Or maybe not.

26
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:07,316
Kill him now.

27
00:01:07,443 --> 00:01:09,819
No more confessions,
no more good deeds,

28
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:12,447
and no more fucking remorse.

29
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:13,781
This isn't how you die.

30
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,616
It's been my dad's baby for years.

31
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:18,327
Fucking hate you!
Fucking asshole!

32
00:01:20,456 --> 00:01:21,664
Get the fuck...

33
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,416
off of him!

34
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,129
I should have fucking killed you
when I had the chance.

35
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:32,133
Did you and my father
have a romantic relationship?

36
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:35,386
I was one of his girlfriends,
if that's what you're asking.

37
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:36,471
There were others?

38
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:38,723
Laura Moser, my mother.

39
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:40,975
- You remember now?
- I have a brother.

40
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,144
Watching mom die...

41
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,772
It's all right, little guy.
You're safe now.

42
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,149
Arthur!

43
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:53,237
Oh, my God.
The boys begin the cycle.

44
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:57,408
If I can make the police think the Trinity
Killer is someone else, Arthur's all mine.

45
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,243
Stan Beaudry.

46
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,370
A decoy.

47
00:02:01,497 --> 00:02:05,291
I just need to make sure
the police find Arthur's DNA.

48
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:08,211
Stan Beaudry
is now the Trinity Killer.

49
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:11,672
- I killed Lundy.
- Wait, no! Don't, don't!

50
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:15,885
Who are you, Kyle?

51
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:18,805
What is it you want?

52
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:31,609
Hello... Dexter Morgan.

53
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:28,100
He knows my name, occupation.

54
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,561
He can find out about my family.

55
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,022
My family.

56
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:35,149
What the hell have I done?

57
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:42,073
I'm sorry, sir.
You're on the wrong floor.

58
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:45,159
No, it's exactly the right floor.

59
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,752
We should talk somewhere else.

60
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,046
Somewhere private...

61
00:04:57,172 --> 00:05:00,758
so you can extort money
from the Trinity Killer?

62
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:08,057
So what do you want?

63
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:11,018
I want you to disappear from my life.

64
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,021
Like a ghost.

65
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,857
A really annoying ghost.

66
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:18,859
And you'll disappear from my life?

67
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:22,071
I couldn't care less about your life.

68
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:24,198
Or death.

69
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,034
Unless you get in my way.

70
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,131
If I were you, I'd give up vigilanteism.

71
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:42,425
You're not very good at it.

72
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,137
Goodbye...

73
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:49,015
Dexter Morgan.

74
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:55,187
He's right. I screwed up.
I let it come to this.

75
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:05,197
But no more.

76
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,538
No fucking more.

77
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,101
Morgan.

78
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,728
Come on, Quinn. Not today.

79
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:38,147
Jesus, Morgan, middle of the day,
you're out again?

80
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,816
Yeah, I have some
secondary analysis to do

81
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,693
- on the Kyle Butler case.
- There's a spatter report

82
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,279
on Christine Hill's suicide sitting
on your desk - you even look at it?

83
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,947
I don't need to.
It's a cut-and-dry suicide.

84
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,783
Yeah, but you have to sign off on it.

85
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,494
That's how it works - you sign off,
case closed. It gets put in a file cabinet

86
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,704
so I don't have to think about it
or hear about it

87
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,748
- or be fucking reminded of it...
- I'll get to it.

88
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:57,291
What, when you're done chasing tail?

89
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,002
You do not want to question
my loyalty to my family, Quinn.

90
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,337
Not today.

91
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:04,090
Do your fucking job!

92
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:12,473
Great. Fucking mess.

93
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:18,687
Do you even have a plan here?

94
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:20,648
Follow him and look
for an opportunity.

95
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,650
What if he keeps on driving?

96
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:27,696
Then I keep on driving.

97
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:29,907
- It's Rita.
- Don't answer it.

98
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,201
Could be important, about the baby
or something. Hey, you.

99
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:35,329
I have something
very important to say.

100
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,372
Everything OK?

101
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,376
I want my honeymoon

102
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:42,419
with you this weekend.

103
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,049
Uh, it's not really a good time.

104
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:51,846
It's a perfect time. Astor and Cody
will be in Disney World.

105
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,267
With Paul's parents.
I know, I remember.

106
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,603
And Harrison will be with us,
but it'll still be romantic.

107
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,189
I think it's... fantastic.

108
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,442
Great. I'll start booking
flights and a hotel and...

109
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,862
- Hey!
- Gotta go.

110
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,073
What the... fuck, man!

111
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,868
Told you not to answer it.

112
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,744
I'll deal with it later.

113
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,955
The messes are piling up.

114
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:07,922
Isolated. No security. Perfect.

115
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,551
Gotta risk it.

116
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,595
May be the only opportunity I get.

117
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,781
Three postcards
don't have a match.

118
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,491
Trinity sent these
to Christine from Cheyenne,

119
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,326
Topeka, and Bloomington, Illinois.

120
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:39,078
- Morgan...
- Lundy never uncovered

121
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,121
Trinity killings in these cities...

122
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,332
which means there could be
as many more as nine murders.

123
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,209
- Go home.
- I'm gonna call Homicide

124
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:46,460
in each of these cities.

125
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,213
Christine Hill just committed suicide.

126
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:51,006
In front of you.

127
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,549
Four hours ago.

128
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:55,177
Now, take a personal day.
Get some closure.

129
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,971
- That's an order.
- These cities...

130
00:09:57,097 --> 00:10:00,015
I'll call their Homicide departments.

131
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:03,686
- Stan Beaudry is...
- Is our number one Trinity suspect.

132
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,646
We're on it.

133
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:08,691
What's she still doing here?

134
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,818
She's going.

135
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,239
Closure, huh?

136
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:22,413
Some of the cities
on these postcards...

137
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,875
What?

138
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:28,711
You're my husband.

139
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:31,213
And I have a wife.

140
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,674
So... what do we do now?

141
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,719
We find the Trinity Killer.

142
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:38,721
No. I mean, do we...

143
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,347
move in together?

144
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,890
Married people do that.

145
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:44,184
My house?

146
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,353
Your house sounds fine.

147
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,065
Valerie? Debra Morgan.

148
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,609
Yeah, fine.

149
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:54,903
You said my dad left you
for another CI?

150
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,530
You followed him to her house?

151
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,533
Any chance you remember
where she lives?

152
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,411
Really? Great.

153
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:05,372
My day just got wide open.
You up for a road trip?

154
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,026
Finally, it's over.

155
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:51,585
Savings account closed.
Checking account closed.

156
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,966
You were gonna leave town,
weren't you?

157
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:00,969
And probably leave
your family destitute too.

158
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:03,972
Eventually the police
will see through Stan Beaudry,

159
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:06,100
and they'll get on to you.

160
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:11,897
But you'll be missing
with all your money,

161
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:14,650
and everyone will assume...

162
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:16,944
that you skipped the country.

163
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,197
Luck is finally working with me.

164
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:26,120
That's the car right there
that swiped me over on Riverside.

165
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,913
Seriously? Fuck!

166
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:46,140
Hey, that's him! That's the prick.

167
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,350
- Who, me?
- You fucking hit my car!

168
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,519
Learn how to drive, you idiot.

169
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:53,522
'Cause being rude always helps
in a tense situation, right?

170
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:55,524
- Calm down.
- Look, I'm sorry.

171
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,693
I was on my way
to a crime scene.

172
00:12:57,819 --> 00:12:59,194
Miami Metro, Forensics.

173
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,363
Come on, he's working
the whole cop brotherhood angle?

174
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,990
No one's above the law, pal.

175
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,033
OK. Be cool.

176
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,869
Diplomatic.

177
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:09,538
Look, obviously, I'll pay
for whatever the damage is.

178
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:12,708
- You fled the scene of an accident.
- I didn't flee. I was in a hurry.

179
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:14,710
- To solve a crime.
- So you stop at a bank?

180
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:15,752
That's bullshit!

181
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:19,173
I'm just asking for a little
professional courtesy here.

182
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,674
You might pull that shit
down at Miami Metro,

183
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,885
but here at the Sheriff's Department,
we don't put up with that shit.

184
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:24,094
- Come on!
- Caught on tape, asshole.

185
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,180
Don't fucking point that thing at me.

186
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,556
All right, come here.

187
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:30,058
OK, buddy, we're taking you in.

188
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:32,311
So much for diplomacy.

189
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:41,320
- You sure this is the right block?
- Pretty sure.

190
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:46,408
- Want one?
- Quit.

191
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:49,411
Ugh. I remember when
your dad stopped, cold turkey.

192
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,413
If Harry said he was gonna
do something, he did it.

193
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,582
- He was a good man.
- He was a man-whore.

194
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,459
Yeah, but he was a lot
of other things too.

195
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,294
Like he always made me feel safe.

196
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,296
And the crowd I ran with -
that meant a lot.

197
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:01,173
Here it is.

198
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,595
What's wrong?

199
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:09,097
- Fucking can't be.
- No. This is it.

200
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:11,391
I remember the porch.

201
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,227
Why, what is it?

202
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,480
I've been here before.

203
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:21,568
Aah!

204
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,986
Oh, God!

205
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,780
He brought me here.

206
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:26,573
Who did?

207
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,747
The Ice Truck Killer. Brian Moser.

208
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,123
That was her name!

209
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,710
Laura Moser.
She had two little boys.

210
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,842
Dad, who the hell were you?

211
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,814
I don't have time for this shit.

212
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,607
Why are you even in here?

213
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,818
Because of Arthur fucking Mitchell.

214
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:04,778
Wrong.

215
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:09,533
All right, I'm here because
I didn't follow the code.

216
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:13,453
Everything you taught me
was to keep me out of here.

217
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,289
- What else?
- What do you want me to say?

218
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,583
I'm here because I lost it?
Yes. I fucking lost it.

219
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:19,751
On a fucking cop!

220
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,962
- Like a fucking amateur.
- Fuck you!

221
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,172
It's your number one rule -
don't get caught.

222
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:25,507
They were gonna find him.

223
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,968
They were gonna find me
with an unconscious man.

224
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,137
That's not why you lost it.

225
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,389
That's not why you're in here.

226
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:35,309
I couldn't just let them
find him, God damn it.

227
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:38,228
I have to be the one to kill him.

228
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,274
I have to know he's gone.

229
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:46,028
For my family.

230
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:47,654
Exactly.

231
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:51,241
You can't think clearly
because of them.

232
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,578
They've done this to you.

233
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,874
No, my dark passenger
has done this to me.

234
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,126
It's ruining my life.

235
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:03,754
It is your life.

236
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:09,134
I don't want it to be.

237
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:14,014
I don't want it.

238
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:19,645
- You said you had something?
- Nothing good.

239
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:21,772
Been back-checking
Stan Beaudry's trucking routes,

240
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:23,565
dug up a couple of past employers.

241
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:26,360
They put him 3,000 miles away
from Pittsburgh in '89

242
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:27,778
and Sacramento in '92.

243
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:30,197
And Beaudry's only been
connected to a prostitute kill.

244
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:31,740
Nothing ritualized about it.

245
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:35,285
I told Matthews it was too soon
to release Beaudry to the press.

246
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,871
If he's not our guy,
we're gonna look like fools.

247
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,873
I knew it wasn't Beaudry.

248
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:42,959
What? I'm smarter
than the rest of you.

249
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:45,796
Then how do you explain
Trinity's DNA showing up

250
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,048
- in Beaudry's rig and shack?
- Yeah, smart man.

251
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,133
Well, I can't... yet.

252
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,678
Sergeant, you find something?

253
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,722
I spoke with Bloomington Homicide.

254
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,557
I asked about the dates
on this postmark.

255
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:00,602
Summer of '92,
there was a bathtub murder,

256
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,437
a jumper, and a bludgeoning.

257
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:05,232
I see a big "but" on your face.

258
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,274
What?

259
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:09,236
Guy said it was
the worst month of his life.

260
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,155
In addition to those murders,
there was a ten-year-old boy missing

261
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,574
five days prior to the bathtub kill.

262
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:18,495
Last week, that ten-year-old boy
went missing here.

263
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,622
- Scott Smith.
- Exactly.

264
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,416
So I called a few cities.

265
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,168
Ten-year-old boys missing?

266
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,295
Every time.

267
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:30,132
Five days before
each cycle began.

268
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:33,844
And Lundy was only looking
at homicides, not missing persons.

269
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,178
Get Scott Smith down here.

270
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:38,849
Let's check every Trinity city
for missing ten-year-olds.

271
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:41,768
We may be looking
at a whole new pattern.

272
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,533
"Brian and...

273
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:59,119
"Dexter Moser"?

274
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,461
Dexter Morgan?

275
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:08,503
Yeah.

276
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,338
It's your lucky day.

277
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:11,506
Yeah. It feels like it.

278
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,550
We're outta bunks for the night.

279
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,846
There's a shot
Arthur's still unconscious.

280
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:19,055
Bummer.

281
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:21,641
Yeah, well, budget cuts
are gettin' worse and worse.

282
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,185
But since you're Miami Metro,

283
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:26,646
we figured we could at least
do you the favor of calling your wife,

284
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:29,649
- have her come pick you up.
- My wife?

285
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:39,242
How is it I can kill people
and feel no regret...

286
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:44,831
but disappointing Rita makes me feel
like the scum of the earth?

287
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,793
I'm sorry.

288
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,127
I know.

289
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,089
I just had a...

290
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,176
bad day and...

291
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:57,552
let it get to me, I guess.

292
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:01,181
First it was smashing that light,
which was... weird.

293
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:04,017
And then you punched Elliot,
which I actually liked.

294
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,270
But now you...
pick a fight with a sheriff?

295
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:11,107
I don't understand.
I want to, but...

296
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:13,109
I wish I could explain.

297
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:15,570
Try. Please.

298
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,910
Sometimes I'm just goin' along,

299
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:25,205
and everything seems OK,
and then this...

300
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:29,334
darkness creeps in,
and it takes over.

301
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:33,380
Makes you sound crazy.

302
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,384
Maybe I am.

303
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,427
No.

304
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:41,304
No, I don't believe that.

305
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,938
I'll be right behind you.

306
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:15,547
Shit.

307
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:25,056
Well, you actually think Dad'll let you
go to the winter prom?

308
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:28,643
- He doesn't have to know.
- We can figure something out.

309
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,858
Arthur! We didn't know
when to expect you.

310
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:37,652
Bring me your jewelry -
gold, silver, anything with a stone in it.

311
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,446
And all the cash in your purse.

312
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:42,657
- Why? What's wrong?
- And your wedding ring.

313
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,159
No. This is mine.

314
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:45,493
- Arthur!
- Hey!

315
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,620
Don't, Jonah, no!

316
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,163
- OK.
- Daddy, what's happening?

317
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:50,665
I need the money you keep
behind your headboard.

318
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,334
Don't pretend. I know it's there!

319
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,377
- No, Daddy! Daddy, why...
- The silver pendant I gave you.

320
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,671
- Now!
- What the hell is goin' on?

321
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:59,507
- What did you do?
- Arthur, please, no!

322
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:02,510
You're lucky I don't pull
the fillings out of your teeth!

323
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:05,805
Don't ever question me!
I gave you everything you have.

324
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:08,308
I will take it all away!

325
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:12,520
Collect your things.
I've got some business to attend to.

326
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:14,856
Other than stealing
from your family?

327
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:16,232
Jonah.

328
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:19,235
Someone stole something from me.

329
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,447
And I'm gonna find him.

330
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,910
We... We should just go.

331
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:28,995
Leave and never come back.

332
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,705
He'll find us.

333
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,499
This... This is our chance.

334
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,210
He's... He's in trouble. He's insane.

335
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:37,003
- Mom!
- What?

336
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,546
Please.

337
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:41,091
We'll live in fear.

338
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:43,969
We already do.

339
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:56,147
Debra. Oh, sorry.

340
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,066
Detective Morgan.
Have a seat.

341
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:00,235
Thanks for your time,
Deputy Chief.

342
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:01,945
I know you're busy.

343
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:04,280
I need to talk to you about a case.

344
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:07,450
It was one of my father's
old cases from a long time ago.

345
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:10,412
And you're the only one
still around from those days.

346
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:13,248
Suddenly I feel ancient.

347
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:16,501
Look, it was a quadruple homicide...

348
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:18,628
out at the ports.

349
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:21,756
In a shipping container.

350
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:24,592
- You were there?
- No. Wasn't my case.

351
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:27,762
But I remember Harry's face
when he came back from it.

352
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:30,724
Said he'd never seen
so much blood.

353
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,018
Sorry.

354
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:43,987
My dad said Dexter's parents
died in a car accident.

355
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,366
That's not true, is it?

356
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,286
No.

357
00:22:51,412 --> 00:22:55,498
My father's CI, Laura Moser,

358
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:58,460
was murdered
in that shipping container.

359
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,838
She had two boys.

360
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:06,051
One of those boys was Dexter?

361
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,764
Please tell me the truth.

362
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:16,269
Harry adopted him.

363
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:19,647
The other boy was too damaged
by the incident.

364
00:23:19,774 --> 00:23:21,775
No shit.

365
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,360
He grew up to be the Ice Truck Killer.

366
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:28,031
You knew.

367
00:23:30,785 --> 00:23:33,328
Debra, your father
wanted to protect you.

368
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:36,206
He didn't want either
one of you to ever know.

369
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:39,000
And you both turned out
pretty damn well.

370
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:41,002
So I think he made the right call.

371
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,837
Yeah?

372
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,965
Well, I know now.

373
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:49,552
What the hell am I supposed
to do with this?

374
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,429
You keep it to yourself.

375
00:23:53,808 --> 00:23:55,350
Oh, fuck! Jesus!

376
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:57,644
Quinn, what?

377
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,771
I'll be right there.

378
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:37,934
We should go
to the Keys tomorrow.

379
00:24:38,853 --> 00:24:40,520
For our honeymoon.

380
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:42,856
No, I'm not sure that's...

381
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:45,066
You can fly down in the morning.
I'll follow you after work.

382
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,735
Have a spa day. Indulge.

383
00:24:47,862 --> 00:24:49,737
Please?

384
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,993
- Dexter, uh...
- Look, I know you're upset.

385
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:57,871
You have every right to be.

386
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:03,543
Having to pick up
another husband from jail.

387
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:08,381
You... You think I'm upset
because you're like Paul?

388
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:11,384
I'm worse.

389
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,803
- I know.
- Dexter.

390
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:18,141
Whenever they picked up Paul,
it was a relief.

391
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,977
And life got easier.

392
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:24,397
Without you...

393
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,570
You're the most important
person in our lives.

394
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:35,909
What's upsetting me
is the idea of losing you.

395
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:40,788
You have your demons.

396
00:25:40,915 --> 00:25:42,874
I accept that.

397
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,002
Because I know that you don't
have to be a slave to them.

398
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:48,421
I wish that were true.

399
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,298
It is.

400
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:52,634
I know you.

401
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,261
Better than you know yourself.

402
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:59,974
You can conquer
whatever darkness there is in you.

403
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,060
I know you can.

404
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:10,360
I want to be that man.

405
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:15,490
You already are.

406
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:17,659
Please.

407
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:20,745
Please fly to the Keys
tomorrow morning.

408
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:23,331
I wanna meet you.

409
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:28,920
Truly, there's nowhere
I'd rather be.

410
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:45,311
Trinity sure went to a lot of effort

411
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,605
to make us think that
Beaudry was our guy.

412
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:50,525
Planting DNA.
Planting Lundy's murder books.

413
00:26:50,651 --> 00:26:53,152
Have we heard back from
any more Homicide departments?

414
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,239
Almost every town. Ten-year-old boys
missing in all of them.

415
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:58,032
Quinn is talking
to Scott Smith now.

416
00:26:58,158 --> 00:26:59,117
No, I'm not.

417
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:01,661
I called in someone who knows
about being kidnapped.

418
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:05,707
Someone took me once too.

419
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,041
Without my permission.

420
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:10,378
- Were you scared?
- Most scared I've ever been in my life.

421
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:15,925
And... as much as I want to forget,

422
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:19,679
there are all these
little things I remember.

423
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:24,183
The way his breath
smelled like medicine.

424
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,269
The bad man.

425
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:28,396
Used medicine on me.

426
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,107
When I was getting in the van.

427
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,235
Do you remember any
little things about the van?

428
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:37,655
It was empty.
Except for some papers.

429
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,700
There was a picture on it.

430
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,911
Do you remember what it looked like?

431
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,373
Uh...

432
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:03,639
We're looking for this logo.

433
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:16,903
We've got something.

434
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:19,530
We walked cadaver dogs
over the whole area.

435
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:22,658
They led us to this spot,
and the guys started digging.

436
00:28:22,785 --> 00:28:25,411
They found something
buried under the patio.

437
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:31,417
All right, hold up.

438
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:52,188
Male victim.

439
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:54,982
Approximate age...
ten years old.

440
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:56,692
Badly decomposed.

441
00:28:56,819 --> 00:28:58,361
Looks to be wearing pajamas.

442
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:00,488
They found Scott Smith
wearing pajamas.

443
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:04,158
I'll call Judge Morales at home,
have her get a warrant started.

444
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:06,994
I'll get the names of everyone
who volunteered on this build.

445
00:29:07,121 --> 00:29:10,706
Make it everyone who volunteered
for Four Walls nationwide.

446
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:12,500
Cross-check 'em
with Trinity's cities.

447
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:16,254
We'll find Trinity's real name,
then we'll take this motherfucker down.

448
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:45,867
You're a little piggy, Dexter Morgan.

449
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,335
"Debra Morgan."

450
00:29:58,088 --> 00:29:59,755
Debra Morgan!

451
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:02,341
Fucking Debra!

452
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:06,012
Astor and Cody,
Disney World awaits.

453
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:09,557
They'll be safe there
with Mickey, Minnie,

454
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:11,851
and their goofy grandparents.

455
00:30:18,192 --> 00:30:20,193
Now for the rest of my family.

456
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,445
Found it!

457
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:24,572
Oh.

458
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:29,035
Wish I could go with you right now.

459
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:30,912
Me too.

460
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:33,789
I just got a few loose ends to tie up at work,
and I'll see you tonight.

461
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:35,666
Can't wait.

462
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:38,711
Me either.

463
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:41,714
Can't wait to be with my family.

464
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:46,385
Can't wait to be done
with Arthur Mitchell.

465
00:30:49,223 --> 00:30:51,516
I just need a clue where he's headed.

466
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:55,770
Receipts.

467
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:57,939
Drug store.
Auto shop estimate.

468
00:30:58,065 --> 00:31:00,399
Dry-cleaner, groceries, gas.

469
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:03,569
No bus, train, or plane tickets.

470
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,782
Only one other place I can check.

471
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,876
- Mr. Butler, what...
- Jonah, have you seen your father?

472
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:22,505
Yeah, he blew through here last night
looking for anything he could sell.

473
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:24,966
Jonah! Who is...

474
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:27,134
- Kyle.
- He's asking about Dad.

475
00:31:27,261 --> 00:31:29,470
Can you tell me
what's going on?

476
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,305
I'm not sure.

477
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:33,266
I hope he stays gone this time.

478
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,685
He took... everything.

479
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:39,146
It's gonna be OK. I promise.

480
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:41,148
I'll make sure you get Arthur's money.

481
00:31:41,275 --> 00:31:43,025
Did he say where
he was headed?

482
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,653
- He never does.
- Did he take his tools?

483
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:47,655
Pack a bag?
Does he have a passport?

484
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:50,825
I don't know. When we got up
this morning, he was gone.

485
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:01,961
Shit.

486
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,131
Aah!

487
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,134
Get down! Down on the ground!

488
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:16,851
We create our own destiny
every day we live.

489
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:30,114
- Freeze! Hands up.
- Forensics.

490
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,657
All right.

491
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,667
Dexter.

492
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:45,921
Where's your flak jacket?

493
00:32:46,048 --> 00:32:49,258
I left it in the car.
Do you see this?

494
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,260
Cabrón.

495
00:32:51,762 --> 00:32:53,804
And over here...

496
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:57,016
Look. It's a framing hammer.

497
00:32:57,142 --> 00:33:00,227
I'll get Masuka in here,
get some DNA.

498
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:09,862
- What?
- How'd you get here so fast?

499
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,449
Word's everywhere.

500
00:33:14,368 --> 00:33:15,743
You found Trinity.

501
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:19,038
Yeah, the Four Walls national database
led us to Arthur Mitchell.

502
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:22,667
Can you believe that fucking
monster had a family?

503
00:33:22,793 --> 00:33:24,752
And he abandoned them?

504
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:26,921
He's gone?

505
00:33:27,047 --> 00:33:29,215
Yeah, he emptied out his bank accounts
and disappeared.

506
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,384
He's probably halfway
around the world by now.

507
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:34,178
Probably.

508
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,765
Deb, what's...

509
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:41,727
Why don't you get your fucking flak jacket
so everyone knows you're one of us?

510
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:49,193
Hey. It's the fucking Karate Kid.

511
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:50,820
Yeah, about that, uh...

512
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:54,490
You pull that shit again, next time
I won't be the one who's on my ass.

513
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,822
This is their future, Dexter.

514
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:36,532
We both know it's inevitable.

515
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:40,786
No. Arthur abandoned his family.

516
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,997
I would never do that.

517
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:46,500
Arthur left his family too late.
The damage was already done.

518
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,794
You can still save your family.

519
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:54,300
By leaving them?

520
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:56,635
You'll always need
someone on your table.

521
00:34:56,762 --> 00:34:59,346
If you stay,
sooner or later you'll be caught,

522
00:34:59,473 --> 00:35:02,683
and they'll pay a terrible price
for what you've done.

523
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:08,981
Because long after
you're executed...

524
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,524
they'll still have to go through life

525
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,985
with your name branded
across their foreheads.

526
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:15,821
Dex.

527
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:28,209
I have something to tell you.

528
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:30,920
- And maybe I shouldn't. I don't know.
- OK.

529
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:35,925
I found another CI
Dad was sleeping with.

530
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:37,885
A woman named Laura Moser.

531
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:40,554
Harry was right. This is it.

532
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,724
Does that name
mean anything to you?

533
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:46,602
- Should it?
- It doesn't?

534
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:49,271
Look, she died,

535
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,857
but she left behind two little boys.

536
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:56,612
And one of those
little boys was you.

537
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:02,076
Laura Moser
is your biological mother.

538
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:04,411
Don't say the rest. Don't know it.

539
00:36:04,538 --> 00:36:07,456
The other little boy, your brother,

540
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,542
was named Brian.

541
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:13,212
Brian Moser.

542
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,174
The Ice Truck Killer.

543
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:20,803
She knows who I really am. It's over.

544
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:23,597
I wasn't gonna tell you,
but then I saw Trinity's family,

545
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:26,684
and I thought that it's better
for you to know the truth.

546
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:29,854
The truth?

547
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,523
The truth...

548
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,828
That's a lot to take in.

549
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:46,996
I know.

550
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:49,665
And that's all she knows?

551
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:52,084
Do you think Brian knew about me?

552
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,420
I don't know.

553
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:57,673
He must have glommed
onto you as a way to...

554
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:58,924
get to me.

555
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,429
Don't you see, it wasn't your fault.
He wasn't your fault.

556
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,349
If I'd never been in your life...

557
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,310
Fuck you.

558
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:10,644
Fuck me?

559
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:14,481
If you hadn't been in my life,
I wouldn't be who I am.

560
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:20,154
You've given me confidence...

561
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:23,157
and support.

562
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:26,368
And...

563
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,621
you've been the one constant.

564
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:34,501
The one constantly good thing
in my life.

565
00:37:34,628 --> 00:37:37,087
I've been good for her.

566
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:40,007
And Rita says I'm good
for her and the kids.

567
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:43,052
No one would ever say that
about Arthur.

568
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:44,762
Maybe Harry's wrong.

569
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:47,097
Maybe things could turn out
differently for me.

570
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,474
Morgan.

571
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,726
Debra Morgan. Need you inside.

572
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:52,770
I'll be right there.

573
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:59,568
I love you.

574
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:03,989
I'm so thankful.

575
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:23,676
The Mustang.

576
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:27,888
Arthur brought it in two days ago.

577
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,890
Should have known
he wouldn't leave it behind.

578
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:32,434
Here. Take the rest of this.

579
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,061
Mr. Mitchell, this gonna be nice.

580
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:36,271
Ah, it's beautiful work, Julio.

581
00:38:36,398 --> 00:38:39,733
Especially on such short notice.

582
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:44,071
Por favor, the paint.

583
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:48,659
The paint. It needs more dry!
Tres horas más!

584
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:51,829
Shit.

585
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:41,003
The wife had no clue
what the husband was up to.

586
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:42,046
Do we believe her?

587
00:39:42,172 --> 00:39:44,673
She threw up when I showed them
the pictures of what he did.

588
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,633
That can be faked.

589
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:49,803
This is the team
that broke the case.

590
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:50,971
Lieutenant LaGuerta,

591
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:53,515
Special Agent Davis of the FBI.

592
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:56,018
First-rate job. Congratulations.

593
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:57,436
It was Detective Morgan

594
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,772
who brought these killings
to the department's attention.

595
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:02,775
- Building on the work of one of your own.
- Special Agent Lundy.

596
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:05,652
Fuck yes, Special Agent Lundy.

597
00:40:05,779 --> 00:40:07,821
- He told you guys...
- It's been a long day.

598
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:10,491
No disrespect, but she's right.

599
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:15,162
I agree. In retrospect, the Bureau
should have proceeded differently.

600
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:18,082
Well, your retrospect
cost a man his life.

601
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:20,667
We'll be taking over from here.

602
00:40:20,794 --> 00:40:22,836
So after we do all the heavy lifting...

603
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,338
You get all the credit.

604
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:27,341
I'm sure they're grateful
for all your hard work.

605
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:28,759
We are.

606
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:34,640
Motherfuck.

607
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,017
I know.

608
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:39,645
But it is what it is.

609
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:18,976
Damn it to hell.

610
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:40,205
Where's my fucking oil cap?

611
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:49,214
Hello, Arthur Mitchell.

612
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:53,135
Ah!

613
00:42:08,902 --> 00:42:11,403
Guess you were picturing
a different scenario.

614
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:20,746
I was following my path.

615
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:24,791
So was I.

616
00:42:24,918 --> 00:42:26,919
God led you to me.

617
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:33,050
Hardly.

618
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,697
Is this who you are?

619
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:57,783
Ta-da!

620
00:42:57,909 --> 00:43:00,953
Oh, look at you.
I never took pride in what I did.

621
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:04,122
No, you're a very special
kind of monster.

622
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:05,832
You destroyed your own family.

623
00:43:05,959 --> 00:43:09,544
- I gave them everything!
- No, you took everything.

624
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:12,339
Their future. Their dignity.

625
00:43:12,465 --> 00:43:14,341
Their hope.

626
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:16,009
Christine...

627
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:18,345
even killed herself.

628
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:19,972
No!

629
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:23,892
Because of you.

630
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:29,481
She was weak.

631
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:30,816
I can't believe there was a time

632
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:34,027
when I actually thought I could
learn something from you.

633
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:35,529
You think you're better than I am?

634
00:43:35,655 --> 00:43:36,780
No.

635
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:41,326
But I want to be.

636
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:46,039
You can't control
the demon inside of you

637
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:48,250
any more than I can control mine.

638
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:53,714
Did you ever actually try?

639
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,549
Oh, my God, yes.

640
00:43:55,675 --> 00:43:58,218
I prayed to be changed.

641
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,679
To be made... different.

642
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:03,598
That's not trying.
That's waiting to be stopped.

643
00:44:03,725 --> 00:44:06,435
It worked, didn't it?

644
00:44:08,021 --> 00:44:09,730
Case in point.

645
00:44:09,856 --> 00:44:12,607
So what's the alternative, Arthur?

646
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:16,403
Leave? Disappear?

647
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:19,197
Fake my own death
and start over again?

648
00:44:19,324 --> 00:44:21,074
No.

649
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:24,036
You'll still be you.

650
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:26,204
I have a family too, Arthur.

651
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:31,543
And I'm good... for them.

652
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:37,215
You're like a child.

653
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:40,135
Mm, a child with a big knife.

654
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:42,596
You dream of a heaven
you'll never see.

655
00:44:42,722 --> 00:44:46,099
- I don't believe in heaven.
- Oh, but you do.

656
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:48,518
This isn't your doing.

657
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:50,604
This is God's plan.

658
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:52,981
I accept that now.

659
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:55,901
You have to do the same.

660
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:59,946
I accept... nothing.

661
00:45:00,073 --> 00:45:02,115
Nothing is inevitable.

662
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:04,576
It's already over.

663
00:45:07,747 --> 00:45:09,748
It's already over.

664
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:17,631
Could you...

665
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:27,682
Thank you.

666
00:45:39,529 --> 00:45:42,989
♪ I'll give her all the love
I have to give

667
00:45:43,116 --> 00:45:46,076
♪ As long as we both shall live ♪

668
00:45:57,505 --> 00:45:59,506
Now it's over.

669
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:30,745
I wonder if Rita's looking
at this same moon

670
00:46:30,872 --> 00:46:32,914
at this same moment.

671
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,624
I like that -

672
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,501
connected by light.

673
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:40,088
The dark passenger's
been fighting against it,

674
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:42,424
trying to keep me all to himself.

675
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:44,593
But it's my turn now...

676
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:46,720
to get what I want.

677
00:46:48,181 --> 00:46:50,182
To embrace my family.

678
00:46:54,896 --> 00:46:57,939
And maybe one day
not so long from now...

679
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:02,736
I'll be rid of the dark passenger.

680
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:09,784
It all begins with a getaway.

681
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:14,039
Time away from the old me.

682
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:40,315
It's OK.

683
00:47:40,441 --> 00:47:42,442
Life doesn't have to be perfect.

684
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:46,780
It just has to be lived.

685
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:02,295
Unheard message.

686
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:04,464
Hey, sweetie, I'm a dope.

687
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:06,466
I was in such a rush
to get Harrison organized

688
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:09,135
I forgot my ID for the plane,
so I'm zooming home for it.

689
00:48:09,262 --> 00:48:11,179
Means I'll be on a later puddle jumper,

690
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:13,181
but we'll still be there waiting for you.

691
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:16,142
Oh, and I know you're not
into this stuff, but...

692
00:48:16,269 --> 00:48:18,520
the moon tonight
is gonna be amazing.

693
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:20,730
So take a moment.
You deserve it.

694
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:23,191
We love you. Bye.

695
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:07,319
Rita?

696
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:13,825
No.

697
00:49:42,355 --> 00:49:44,356
Born in blood...

698
00:49:45,858 --> 00:49:47,692
both of us.

699
00:49:48,861 --> 00:49:50,904
Harry was right.

700
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:52,906
I thought I could
change what I am,

701
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:55,283
keep my family safe.

702
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:06,878
But it doesn't matter what I do,

703
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:09,923
what I choose.

704
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:12,050
I'm what's wrong.

705
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,847
This is fate.
