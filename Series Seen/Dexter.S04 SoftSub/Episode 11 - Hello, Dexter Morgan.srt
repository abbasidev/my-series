1
00:00:02,044 --> 00:00:03,586
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:05,588
Lundy misread the pattern.

3
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:09,676
It's not three victims
he leaves behind, it's four.

4
00:00:09,802 --> 00:00:13,096
Oh, my God.
The boys begin the cycle.

5
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,306
We broke up. Officially.

6
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:18,101
If I find out this is bullshit,
there will be consequences.

7
00:00:18,227 --> 00:00:21,479
Severe, career-ending consequences.

8
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:24,107
I'm married.

9
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:26,192
- We have this connection.
- I have Dexter.

10
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:29,445
Hey!

11
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,447
- Kyle Butler.
- Remembered my name.

12
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:34,075
Oh, I'm like an elephant.
I never forget.

13
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:36,577
You sure got to the crime scene fast.

14
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:38,454
There's no traffic at 5 a.m.

15
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,249
But dispatch didn't put out the call till 5:05.

16
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:44,127
You were the first reporter
on scene at 5:20.

17
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:47,171
I'm telling you, she knows more
than she's letting on.

18
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,757
Suspicious,
but it doesn't prove a thing.

19
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:53,261
How's this for outside the box?
Christine's the same height as the shooter.

20
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,471
You out of your fuckin' mind?

21
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:58,474
No way Christine had anything to do
with shooting you or Lundy!

22
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,686
You've been dating her for, what, two
months? How well do you even know her?

23
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:03,563
The DNA results on Christine Hill
are back.

24
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:05,565
She's fucking related to Trinity.

25
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:09,444
I went back and I looked through all the
postcards you sent me over the years.

26
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,322
Every trip you took,
in every city you went,

27
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:14,949
a woman died in a bathtub.

28
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:19,662
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- It's all right. I protected you.

29
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:23,166
That FBI agent, Lundy, I shot him.

30
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:24,292
You what?

31
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:30,506
No!

32
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:36,966
I'm gonna ask you again.
How are you related to the Trinity Killer?

33
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:40,136
And I'm gonna tell you again.
I don't know.

34
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:44,724
- Your DNA matches his.
- I don't know anything about that.

35
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,894
Which raises one huge question...

36
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,353
Who are you?

37
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:52,607
Who are any of us, really?

38
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,901
We all have our public life,

39
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:56,736
our private life...

40
00:03:56,862 --> 00:04:00,323
And your secret life.
The one that defines you.

41
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:05,328
Your mother is listed as Lorraine Hill.

42
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:08,164
- Where is she?
- Dead.

43
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,498
Five years now.

44
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:12,793
Your father seems to be...

45
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,172
unknown.

46
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:18,591
Why is that?

47
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:22,678
I told you, my mother got pregnant.

48
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,556
It happens. I never met my father.

49
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,483
I think you're lying.

50
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:40,696
So do I.
I think Christine has her own secret life.

51
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,407
She's got to be Arthur's daughter.

52
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:48,245
Because of your relationship
with our department,

53
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:51,499
we've been treating you
with the greatest of civility.

54
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:57,463
Please... don't let that hide the fact
that you could be in real trouble here.

55
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,509
Give us a name.

56
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:04,387
If she says the name Arthur Mitchell, then...

57
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:05,805
Nationwide manhunt.

58
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:08,224
He's lost to you forever.

59
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:13,187
Give us a name.

60
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,275
So what will you do?

61
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:20,695
He wants a name.

62
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,571
I'll give him a name.

63
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:23,698
A decoy.

64
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:29,203
Exactly. If I can make the police
think the Trinity Killer is someone else,

65
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,372
Arthur's all mine.

66
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:39,588
You've reached
Christine Hill. Please leave a message.

67
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:44,218
Which brings us to our next story.
In a very happy turn of events,

68
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,972
ten-year-old Scott Smith was reunited
with his parents earlier today.

69
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:50,766
Although police have no leads
as to who abducted the boy

70
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,768
or how he came to be returned,

71
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,604
his family is simply happy he's home.

72
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:57,648
Interesting.

73
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,943
Authorities say they will
continue their investigation.

74
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:05,906
With all the DNA samples
from my sister's sweep,

75
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:11,370
there should be one bad guy
I can cast in the role of Trinity.

76
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,289
But I'm striking out.

77
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,257
Hello.

78
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,634
Let me ask you a question.

79
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:28,471
What kind of a man
witnesses a child abduction

80
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:30,806
and doesn't call the police?

81
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:34,268
Who are you, Kyle?
What is it you want?

82
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:43,569
- Money.
- Money?

83
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,571
Is that what all this is about?

84
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:47,323
I want $50,000,

85
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:50,993
or I'll tell the whole world
that Arthur Mitchell, family man,

86
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,913
schoolteacher, church deacon,

87
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:55,164
is a pedophile.

88
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,166
I am most certainly not a pedophile.

89
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:58,834
50,000. Right now.

90
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,836
I'm a schoolteacher.
I don't have that kind of money.

91
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:04,048
Take a loan out on your house.
Sell your car. I really don't care.

92
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,008
I want the money today.

93
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:09,220
That's not possible.
I'm not even in Miami.

94
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,306
Where are you?

95
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,309
Well, I'm not gonna
tell you that, am I, Kyle?

96
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:21,148
It doesn't matter.
You have 24 hours to get me the money.

97
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:25,111
I'll, uh... I'll be in touch.

98
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,368
But I don't know anything.

99
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:35,079
You know about
Morgan and Lundy's shooting.

100
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,915
More than you should.

101
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,836
And you share Trinity's DNA.

102
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,466
I can play this game all day long.

103
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:52,930
But you're in here
until you tell us what we need to know.

104
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:57,476
You can't do that.

105
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:01,063
You can only hold me for 48 hours.

106
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,566
If you were under arrest.

107
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,818
But we're holding you
as a material witness.

108
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,030
So you can keep me as long as you want.

109
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:13,534
That's right,
so you better start talking, bitch.

110
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,996
She says she doesn't know anything.

111
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:18,706
And, what, you believe her?

112
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,917
I know this sucks for you,
but she's in there because she's involved,

113
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,837
- so get your fuckin' head on straight.
- We don't have any proof.

114
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:28,424
Come on, Quinn. You're a detective.
What does your gut say?

115
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,011
I don't know.

116
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:34,972
You're too close to this.

117
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:37,391
I'm not the only one too close.

118
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,104
She say anything yet?

119
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,565
Nope. And she won't.

120
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,359
Let's hope not.

121
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,778
- For Quinn's sake.
- Fuck you!

122
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:51,780
Huh!

123
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:54,617
And you.
Keep me posted.

124
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,952
Whoa, where you going, half day?

125
00:08:57,078 --> 00:09:00,789
To find a Trinity decoy before Christine
says the magic words.

126
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,459
Lunch with Rita, my wife.

127
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:05,920
- Sure you are.
- I'm sorry?

128
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,756
Where is it you really go every day?

129
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:11,759
Cut him some slack.
His girlfriend's a psycho.

130
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:15,179
- Say hi to Rita and Harrison for me.
- Will do.

131
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:20,351
Warrant came through on Christine Hill's
apartment. Let's get a team over there.

132
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:21,769
- Shit.
- Great. I'll drive.

133
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,729
If she won't talk, maybe her apartment will.

134
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:26,065
- I'll ride with you.
- No, absolutely not.

135
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,901
You're not searching your own girlfriend's
apartment. Take Batista.

136
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,611
Send him my way first.

137
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:33,781
I want both of you.
In your office. Now.

138
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:43,832
This is security footage of a robbery
in Coconut Grove last night.

139
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:48,128
Fortunately, our detectives were able to ID
the suspect and make an arrest.

140
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:51,715
But they sent this up to me
for a whole other reason.

141
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:56,637
A half-hour before,
the security cameras recorded this.

142
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,395
Chief, we were off duty, and...

143
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:08,023
Two of my senior people who had signed
sworn affidavits with the department

144
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,776
stating that there was no romantic
involvement between them.

145
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:13,362
- If you'd just let me explain...
- There's nothing to explain.

146
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:17,032
You both lied under oath.
You committed perjury, and that's a felony.

147
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,201
Look, I understand
that we made a mistake,

148
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:22,454
and if necessary, we're willing
to accept the consequences...

149
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,749
You went back on your word
and then you rubbed my face in it.

150
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,710
Your board of review hearing
is the day after tomorrow.

151
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:31,588
I suggest you call your union reps
and start looking into career alternatives.

152
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,842
Wait a s... Hang on.

153
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:38,554
This isn't the first time
that you and I have squared off,

154
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,223
so what exactly is your beef with me?

155
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,976
My gender? My race? What?

156
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,770
Your arrogance.

157
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,828
Lundy's Trinity books.

158
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:07,207
Lundy ran down lots of suspects over the
years who looked like they might be Trinity.

159
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,171
Here.

160
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:14,131
Stan Beaudry.

161
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,843
A long-haul trucker
based right here in Miami.

162
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:20,637
Travels all over the country.

163
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:25,225
Arrested for killing
a prostitute with a crowbar,

164
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:26,977
left her on the side of the highway.

165
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:30,606
The chain of custody on the crowbar
was contaminated. They dropped the case.

166
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:31,940
So he's ours.

167
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:38,072
Rita.

168
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,292
Hey!

169
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,960
What the fuck?

170
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,588
Oh.

171
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,424
I'm sorry, is, uh, is this your house?

172
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,759
Fuck, yeah! This is my house.

173
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,803
I made a mistake.
I thought it was my friend's place.

174
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:03,013
So you're breaking
into your friend's place?

175
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,516
- No.
- You were gonna steal my shit.

176
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:09,603
I assure you, I was not
going to steal your shit.

177
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:13,982
Uh-uh. No, you ain't going anywhere,
old man.

178
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:17,403
All right? I got your license plate number.
I'm gonna call the cops.

179
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,330
Sorry I'm late. It's just one of those days.

180
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,165
Oh, it's OK. You're here now, so...

181
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,794
Uh, sorry.

182
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,295
It's work. One sec.

183
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:39,174
- All right.
- Morgan.

184
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,135
Uh, can it wait?

185
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,761
I'm kind of in...

186
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,304
OK.

187
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,014
Yeah, no, I'll be there.

188
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:48,934
Let me guess. Crime scene?

189
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:51,478
Dexter, we have an appointment.

190
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,105
I know, but it's an emergency.

191
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:55,023
- So is this.
- Why?

192
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:58,652
We're doing better. I'm...

193
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,405
being all open, and...

194
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,907
I kissed Elliot.

195
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:07,453
What?

196
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:11,457
Well, actually, uh, he kissed me, mostly.

197
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:15,544
Look, I was waiting to tell you.

198
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,004
In therapy.

199
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,006
So let's just go to our session, so...

200
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,800
- No, I told you, I can't.
- Dexter, please.

201
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:25,179
I gotta get to work.

202
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:29,099
10-4. This has been reconfirmed.

203
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,352
I came over to borrow his lawn mower.

204
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,771
I-I saw him through the window.
The door was unlocked.

205
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:38,108
Bruising around the neck.
Our guy was choked.

206
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,403
Hey, uh, how was, uh,

207
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,864
lunch/therapy with Rita?

208
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,742
Fine.

209
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:48,785
Vince, stop reading
my desktop calendar.

210
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:50,537
Impact marks here on the floor.

211
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:57,002
- You can talk to me, you know.
- Actually, multiple impact marks.

212
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,839
Somebody smashed his head
against the floor.

213
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:04,718
I saw Rita kissing another dude
at Thanksgiving, OK?

214
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,220
I know. She told me.

215
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:07,596
Oh, thank Christ.

216
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:10,098
We've lived next door five, six years.

217
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:11,517
And what's his name?

218
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:14,228
Kyle. Uh, Kyle Butler.

219
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,899
Arthur Mitchell's in Miami,

220
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,776
and he's looking for me.

221
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:28,742
Another death of an innocent man
that I'm responsible for.

222
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,210
Shoes. And more shoes.

223
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:40,128
Man, Christine has a lot of shoes.

224
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:42,839
Shoes. Shoes.

225
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:46,343
- Shoes.
- Not shoes.

226
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:53,809
Des Moines, Denver, San Francisco.

227
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:57,521
Let me see.

228
00:14:58,273 --> 00:15:00,482
These are all cities in Lundy's books...

229
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:03,277
where Trinity killed.

230
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:09,616
- Look how it's signed.
- "Love, Daddy."

231
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,619
- Trinity is...
- Christine's fucking father.

232
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,788
She's been in contact
with him the whole time.

233
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,124
I knew it. I fuckin' knew
something was off with her.

234
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,750
It still doesn't give us Trinity.

235
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,252
No.

236
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:23,255
But it gives us something
to make the bitch talk.

237
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,498
Arthur will come here next...

238
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,626
and I'll be waiting.

239
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:41,083
As soon as that door closes, it's over.

240
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,837
What the fuck?

241
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:50,967
- Good night.
- See you later.

242
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:52,761
Shit!

243
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:59,059
Fuck.

244
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,607
Not much of a resemblance.

245
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,068
At least he's not looking
for Kyle Butler anymore.

246
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,696
San Francisco, 1996.

247
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:12,906
Same cycle.

248
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,033
A girl dies in a bathtub.

249
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,536
A woman jumps off a building.

250
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:19,913
A man gets bludgeoned outside of a bar.

251
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:25,210
There were Trinity killings
in every single one of these cities.

252
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:31,633
"Wish you were here.

253
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,094
"Love, Daddy."

254
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:44,271
I've never seen those before.

255
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:49,401
- You planted them.
- Are you trying to piss me off more?

256
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:56,408
'Cause I'm sure that Detective Quinn
will be displeased

257
00:17:56,534 --> 00:18:00,829
when he finds out this is why
you cozied up to him,

258
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:02,748
To keep tabs on Daddy.

259
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:04,958
I didn't.

260
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,668
I don't know who my father is.

261
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,336
He is the Trinity Killer.

262
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:14,092
And he's been sending you
postcards from hell.

263
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,262
You've been drafting on us,

264
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:21,933
and when you heard Lundy
was on to your father, you shot him.

265
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:33,779
I want to talk to my lawyer.

266
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:35,989
First smart thing you've said all day.

267
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,368
- She lied.
- Fuck yeah, she lied.

268
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:43,872
Just fucking admit it.
You shot me and you killed Lundy.

269
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:45,874
She fucking used me.

270
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,876
And I fell for it.

271
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:50,295
For her.

272
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:52,047
I'm a fuckin' asshole.

273
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:53,965
Don't... Don't do that.

274
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,051
- What?
- Beat yourself up like that.

275
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:58,261
Why the fuck not?

276
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:02,182
Because I know where it gets you.

277
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:05,227
I was engaged to
the Ice Truck Killer. Hello!

278
00:19:06,521 --> 00:19:09,022
He cut people up,
drained their blood,

279
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,484
wrapped 'em up like
bloody fuckin' Christmas.

280
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,736
Engaged.

281
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,531
As in ready to spend the rest of my life.

282
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:19,407
Yeah.

283
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:24,287
So we can play who's a bigger asshole,
but I guarantee you I'll win.

284
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,082
We're keeping Christine overnight again.

285
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,376
Good. Let her fuckin' rot.

286
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:29,417
Good. Let her fuckin' rot.

287
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:41,596
Stan Beaudry lives off the grid.

288
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,974
A shack in the middle of nowhere.

289
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:49,563
Lone wolf personified.

290
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,606
He's not home.

291
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:55,443
Or is he?

292
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:07,289
Look out for an 18-wheeler with
a tackle box on the driver's side door...

293
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:19,885
Where are you, Mr. Beaudry?

294
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:31,396
Making a delivery in Jacksonville,
due back late tomorrow.

295
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:34,107
Or if I leave now,
I can be in Jacksonville by midnight,

296
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,776
and cut the time... and him... in half.

297
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:39,487
You can't just disappear
all night, Dexter.

298
00:20:39,614 --> 00:20:41,406
Got to get home to your family.

299
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,205
Hey.

300
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:51,249
It's late.

301
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,376
You can't sleep?

302
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:56,338
I stayed up, so we could finish our talk.

303
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:59,841
Can it wait?
I have a huge day tomorrow.

304
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,510
No, it can't.

305
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:04,846
Are the two of you...?

306
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,515
No. No, of course not.

307
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:09,935
It's just a huge mistake,

308
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:12,187
and I am so, so sorry.

309
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:13,855
Well, OK then.

310
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,982
Apology accepted.

311
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:19,819
Shouldn't we talk about this?

312
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:22,447
I thought we just did.

313
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:26,534
You didn't say anything.

314
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:30,372
I'm putting it behind me.
Isn't that what I'm supposed to do?

315
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:32,123
I mean, I'm glad,

316
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:38,713
but if I were you, I would be hurt, angry,
disgusted even.

317
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,300
Is that how you want me to feel?

318
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:46,638
No.

319
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:49,683
Well, good. See?

320
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,060
Everything is OK.

321
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:13,039
You've reached
Christine Hill. Please leave a message.

322
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:30,724
Mom's at work, kids are at school,

323
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:35,103
and for all I know, Trinity's out there doing
exactly what I'm doing at his house -

324
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:36,813
prepping for a kill.

325
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:38,648
Arthur's DNA.

326
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:41,943
If the police search Stan Beaudry's house
and find those,

327
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,487
they'll think he's the Trinity Killer.

328
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,489
For a while, anyway.

329
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,452
Long enough for me to kill the real Trinity.

330
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,081
Morgan.

331
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,459
Dexter, I need you at the station.

332
00:22:57,585 --> 00:23:00,962
Wow. I, um... Kind of right in the middle
of doing some stuff.

333
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,672
Any chance Masuka can cover for me?

334
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,507
No chance at all. Be here.

335
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,093
Shit.

336
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:11,222
You're juggling too many people, Dexter.

337
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:17,979
I know. Arthur, Beaudry,
Rita, now Batista...

338
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,148
I'm not talking about them.

339
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:21,983
I mean Dexter Morgan.

340
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:25,153
Blood tech, husband, father,

341
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:28,198
serial killer, and now
Kyle Butler, extortionist?

342
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:29,699
Which one are you?

343
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,244
All of them.

344
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,876
You still playing "Who's your daddy?"
with Christine?

345
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:43,671
I thought she'd come clean after
spending a night in a cell. No such luck.

346
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:48,218
Tell you what. Before her lawyer gets here,
let me take a shot at her.

347
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:53,473
I thought you might want to refuel.

348
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:56,309
Breakfast burrito.

349
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,186
No, I don't eat that shit.

350
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:00,438
I figured. That's for me.

351
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:04,526
You put some kind of drug
in there to make me talk?

352
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:07,445
You watch way too much TV.

353
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,033
I get it, why you did what you did.

354
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,788
To protect your dad.

355
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,708
I would have done the same thing.

356
00:24:20,835 --> 00:24:23,378
My dad and I were close too.

357
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:29,134
Actually, we weren't.

358
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,847
I wanted us to be, but he never noticed.

359
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:36,683
He was always too busy
with my brother and work.

360
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,977
- Is that why you became a cop?
- Yes, actually.

361
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:41,020
Hmm.

362
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:43,064
You thought that maybe,

363
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:46,317
just maybe, if you became a cop like him,

364
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:49,445
he'd give you that approval
you'd been so hungry for?

365
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:53,741
Well, when you say it like that,
it sounds like a giant cliché.

366
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:55,326
That's because it is.

367
00:24:57,371 --> 00:25:00,081
I don't want to talk about
your daddy issues, OK?

368
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:02,125
Fine.

369
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:06,087
- Let's talk about yours.
- Hmm.

370
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:08,506
Oh, you don't know anything about me.

371
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,633
I know you can still do the right thing.

372
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:17,056
One day, I grew up.

373
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:20,643
And I realized my father wasn't the end-all,

374
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,896
and it didn't matter
what he thought of me,

375
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:25,940
because I realized I didn't think that much
of him anymore either.

376
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:36,534
You think just because you shared,
I'm gonna open up?

377
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,748
You watch too much TV.

378
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,464
How'd it go?

379
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,799
It didn't. Now what?

380
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:54,344
Well, her lawyer's insisting
that we let her go.

381
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:57,305
Let who go?

382
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:58,681
Christine.

383
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,935
Well, if she cares enough about her father
to lie for him...

384
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:04,979
- He could be her first stop.
- Lead us right to him.

385
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,773
You take care of this? I got a meeting.

386
00:26:10,945 --> 00:26:12,779
I'm here.

387
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,447
This is our witness?

388
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,824
Uh, Dexter Morgan,
say hello to Judge Belford.

389
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:19,035
I need you to sign here and here.

390
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,374
And can I see some I.D.?

391
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:32,423
Well, these are the kind of life sentences
I like to hand out.

392
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:35,009
Angel, you may kiss the bride.

393
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:37,303
Excuse me, Dex.

394
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:43,685
And I'm late for my tee time.

395
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,771
- Enjoy your life together.
- Thank you.

396
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:48,856
Thank you. Thanks.

397
00:26:48,983 --> 00:26:50,900
Thank you.

398
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:57,198
Did you two just get married?

399
00:26:57,324 --> 00:27:01,536
According to that piece of paper, we did.
You can be the first to congratulate us.

400
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:02,954
Mazel tov.

401
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,914
That's what I got called in for?

402
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,334
- You're the only one that knows about us.
- Yeah, so keep it to yourself.

403
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,753
Come here.

404
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,218
Patrol just called in.

405
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:19,679
Surveillance is up and running
on Christine Hill's apartment.

406
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:22,181
Good. OK. Thanks.

407
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,686
Shit. I've got work to do.

408
00:27:28,022 --> 00:27:30,189
Beaudry.

409
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:34,736
Breaker 1-9, this is Little Chopper
heading north on the 95 big road

410
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:36,279
just north of Miami.

411
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:41,034
Looking for the 10-20
on one Stan "the man" Beaudry,

412
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,412
driving a black Peter car out of J-town.

413
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,250
Uh, copy, Little Chopper.

414
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:52,128
Just saw him pulling into
Freddy's truck stop off the 91 exit.

415
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:54,172
Thank you, driver.

416
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:00,803
Arthur.

417
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:03,348
I'm standing in front of your house, Kyle.

418
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:06,267
What?

419
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:08,853
I called the Four Walls office
for your home address.

420
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:12,607
Seems to be Johnny's Jet Skis.

421
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:15,109
They're fun. You should try one.

422
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:19,030
What this tells me is you've been
lying to me from the very beginning.

423
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:23,534
Well, in the big scheme of things, being a
liar isn't nearly as bad as being a pedophile.

424
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:27,246
- Do not call me that!
- I want my $50,000.

425
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:31,125
Why should I trust you to be silent
after I've given you the money?

426
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,628
Here's what you can trust.
If you don't meet me with the money,

427
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:36,756
I'll call your family, your school,
and then the police.

428
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:38,591
Give me until tomorrow.

429
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:41,302
How do I know I can trust you?

430
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:44,347
I guess that's just the world we live in, Kyle.

431
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:27,932
You don't let me out of here,
I'm gonna kick your fuckin' ass!

432
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:31,018
Aah! You fuck!

433
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,356
What the fuck are you doing?

434
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:39,318
Normally, we'd have a little chat.
I'd show you the error of your ways.

435
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,699
- But I'm kind of in a hurry here.
- Oh, I am gonna fuck you up!

436
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:48,035
- Uh-huh?
- I'm gonna rip your heart out!

437
00:29:48,162 --> 00:29:50,371
Yeah, I heard.

438
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:55,543
I'm gonna gut you like a fuckin' pig!
You'll be sorry that you ever crossed me!

439
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:57,170
Aah!

440
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:12,602
I just need to make sure
the police find Arthur's DNA.

441
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:20,443
When they see this picture of Christine,
they'll think she's Beaudry's daughter.

442
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:30,536
Lundy's Trinity books.

443
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:43,716
Ah, thanks.

444
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,135
Only be a minute. Mine's dead.

445
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:47,553
Don't have a land line.

446
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:02,443
- Hello.
- Daddy.

447
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:06,447
It's me. I'm sorry I haven't
returned your calls. I've been...

448
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,908
I know where you've been. Don't call me
anymore. You understand?

449
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:10,201
D-Daddy, I just...

450
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:37,270
It's slightly unbelievable that Beaudry
would even own a toothbrush,

451
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:39,897
but I'm gonna go for it.

452
00:31:48,991 --> 00:31:51,784
And now, the final piece of the puzzle.

453
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:58,040
I think I'm done.

454
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,711
Stan Beaudry is now the Trinity Killer.

455
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:11,679
Love thy neighbor.

456
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:13,180
Bullshit.

457
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:23,024
I should leave it alone.
Go inside.

458
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:25,401
Watch the History Channel.

459
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:33,826
Hey, Elliot.

460
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:39,624
Dex.

461
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:44,503
Stay the hell away from my wife.

462
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:46,797
Jesus. Dex...

463
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:49,258
Aah!

464
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:52,136
Wow. OK. Uh, I guess I deserved that.

465
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:55,222
Now, now wait. I know I'm an asshole,
but just wait a minute.

466
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:57,558
I got caught up in a moment.

467
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:00,728
- Rita's amazing.
- You think I don't know that?

468
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:04,607
And I'm an idiot. And if I were you,
I would want to kill me too.

469
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:07,526
Don't ever touch her again.

470
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:17,161
Your hand.

471
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:20,039
You... saw?

472
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:22,541
I saw.

473
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:30,383
- You're not mad?
- No.

474
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:32,218
I'm not mad.

475
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:34,053
What are you?

476
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:40,309
Glad. That you cared that much.

477
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:52,029
- Can't believe you hit him, though.
- I know.

478
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:54,281
- I didn't see that coming.
- I didn't either.

479
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:13,467
Professional courtesy dictates
we give you a heads-up.

480
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:14,635
Mm-hm.

481
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:17,430
- We're married.
- As in man and wife.

482
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:21,726
I don't see how that
changes the facts of the matter.

483
00:34:21,852 --> 00:34:24,103
It's certainly gonna change
the context of your accusation.

484
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:26,647
Do you really want to go
in front of the board of review

485
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,733
and attack the sacrament
of holy matrimony?

486
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:30,568
The issue here is perjury.

487
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:33,571
Alleging an affair is one thing,
but now you'd be going after us

488
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:35,406
for embracing the bedrock
of family values.

489
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:39,326
In heavily Catholic
and heavily Latino Miami.

490
00:34:39,453 --> 00:34:43,998
You'll come across as a soulless,
anti-family schmuck.

491
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:47,376
But if that's what you want to do,
we'll take the fight.

492
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:51,672
It's also worth noting that the chief of police
met his now wife on the job as well.

493
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:55,593
You can lecture him on how he is
in violation of department protocol.

494
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:02,391
I can only marvel at the level of cynicism.

495
00:35:03,185 --> 00:35:06,812
Using the institution of marriage
as a cheap political ploy.

496
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,440
You must be very proud of yourselves
for being so clever.

497
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,444
You didn't give us a lot of options.

498
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:17,490
I hope that your life together will not be
as empty and as amoral

499
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:20,493
as your decision to get married was.

500
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:28,959
We did the right thing.

501
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,547
Of course we did.

502
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,803
Batista.

503
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:40,805
OK.

504
00:35:41,515 --> 00:35:43,641
We just got a lead on the Trinity Killer.

505
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:43,682
We just got a lead on the Trinity Killer.

506
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:49,104
According to this, he had a delivery
two days ago in Jacksonville,

507
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:52,066
and due back here last night.

508
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:55,611
Yeah, well, I'm guessing Christine
found a way to warn him off.

509
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:07,498
Well, hello, Mr. Toothbrush.

510
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:11,126
Don't forget Mr. Comb.

511
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:15,381
Oh, yeah.
We've got some DNA going on in here.

512
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:18,259
Great.

513
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:33,232
Dex, that guy that was bludgeoned,
you remember the kind of hammer?

514
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:35,276
Uh, it was a Grant...

515
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:36,902
24-ounce framing hammer?

516
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:40,239
We got him.

517
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:45,244
It's a little hard to believe this is the same
guy that never made a mistake in 30 years.

518
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,788
Ah, I'm sure he made mistakes.

519
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,623
We just weren't looking.

520
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:55,588
A truck stop employee noticed
Stan Beaudry's truck during the night.

521
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:59,466
Preliminary investigations reveals evidence
pertinent to the Trinity killings.

522
00:36:59,593 --> 00:37:03,012
At this point, we're trying to locate
Mr. Stan Beaudry.

523
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:04,722
He's become our number one suspect.

524
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:06,807
Stan Beaudry?

525
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:15,816
- Kyle?
- Daddy.

526
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:18,819
- I told you not to call me.
- I'm in trouble, Daddy.

527
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:21,113
- The police are...
- You're putting us both at risk.

528
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,489
It isn't safe for us to talk.

529
00:37:22,616 --> 00:37:26,160
I'm on a neighbor's phone. I would never
do anything to put you in danger.

530
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:30,164
You already have. You're a stupid girl!
Always getting in the way.

531
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,624
I was protecting you.

532
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,083
You've ruined everything.

533
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:36,295
I... I did it because I love you.

534
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:44,511
Just, uh...

535
00:37:44,638 --> 00:37:48,349
Just, um... meet me.

536
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:50,851
Please. I can get past the cops.

537
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:54,939
- I don't care. It's not my problem.
- But I need your help.

538
00:37:55,065 --> 00:37:57,107
You did this to yourself. You're on your own.

539
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:00,778
How can you say that?

540
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:05,199
- I'm your daughter.
- I'm sorry, Christine.

541
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:08,369
I'm sorry... I'm sorry too.

542
00:38:08,495 --> 00:38:10,496
I'm sorry you were ever born.

543
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:19,421
- Dad...
- Do not call me again ever.

544
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:29,848
No electric, no water.
Can't track him through his utilities.

545
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:31,892
Someone needs
to take a look in here for...

546
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:36,438
Detective Morgan? We just got word that
Christine Hill would like to speak with you.

547
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:37,856
Only you.

548
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:39,525
Fuckin'-A. She wants to confess.

549
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:41,068
- I'm coming with you.
- Joey, come on.

550
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:42,736
I'll stay outside.
She won't even know I'm there.

551
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:44,905
Let's go.

552
00:38:52,706 --> 00:38:55,207
It hasn't been easy,

553
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:58,252
but I was able to pull together
the funds you are demanding, Kyle.

554
00:38:58,378 --> 00:39:02,256
Well, that's good news.
That'll make both our lives a lot easier.

555
00:39:02,382 --> 00:39:04,758
I'll have the money at 7:00.

556
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,764
I'll drop it in the trash container
nearest the lighthouse at Cape Florida.

557
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,933
That location doesn't work for me, Arthur.

558
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:15,978
The Palmetto Marina on the Miami river,

559
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:20,357
leave it at the entrance to dock C,
and make it 8:00.

560
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,651
You're the boss, Kyle.

561
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,029
Glad you understand.

562
00:39:25,155 --> 00:39:27,489
I'll see you at 8:00.

563
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:30,951
I'll see you in 15 minutes,

564
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:33,537
because I know exactly where
that music is coming from,

565
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:35,205
and why you're there.

566
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:37,249
Unfinished business.

567
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:42,755
Christine, it's Detective Morgan.
Open up.

568
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:51,680
Over there.

569
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,946
Is there something you want to tell me?

570
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,283
That motherfucker.

571
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:14,369
Who? Quinn?
Because he had nothing to do...

572
00:40:14,496 --> 00:40:16,914
No, not Quinn. My dad.

573
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,503
Christine, you can stop protecting him.

574
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:27,007
We have his name.

575
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,425
That's bullshit.

576
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:30,761
We know he's Stan Beaudry.

577
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:37,226
Oh, wow.

578
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:41,939
Just tell me where he is.

579
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:46,151
I tried to be a good daughter.

580
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:49,154
You know...

581
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:52,282
Make him love me.

582
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:56,120
But he hates me.

583
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,165
You don't need him to love you.

584
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,583
Mm-hm.

585
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:03,961
He's a killer.

586
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:06,046
He is. He is.

587
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,881
He's a killer.

588
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:11,093
- He made his own choices...
- And I'm just like him.

589
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,596
- You're not.
- I am.

590
00:41:18,768 --> 00:41:20,853
Your dad was a cop, right?

591
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:24,022
Mm-hm.

592
00:41:24,774 --> 00:41:28,402
So you said, "Hey, I'll be a cop too.

593
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:30,279
"Maybe then he'll love me."

594
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,827
You know what I did?

595
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:40,747
I shot you.

596
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,753
I killed Lundy.

597
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:55,554
OK.

598
00:41:57,557 --> 00:41:59,558
I'm so sorry.

599
00:42:05,607 --> 00:42:07,274
Let's just get you to the station.

600
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:10,861
Can you forgive me?

601
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:12,863
Oh...

602
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:20,162
Are you kidding me?

603
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:27,628
I came here to do a job.

604
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:30,797
I came here to take you in
and to get justice for Lundy,

605
00:42:30,924 --> 00:42:32,925
but forgive you?

606
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:34,968
Fuck you.

607
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:41,099
Let's just get to the station.

608
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:42,893
Wait. No, don't! Don't!

609
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:48,398
- What happened?
- Quinn, don't.

610
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,297
I've searched the entire fucking arcade.

611
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,424
Where are you, Arthur?

612
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:19,972
- Hey, Deb.
- Where are you?

613
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:23,308
Just taking care of business.
What's up?

614
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:26,311
Trinity's daughter
just confessed to everything...

615
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:30,148
and then killed herself.

616
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:32,776
In front of me.

617
00:43:33,403 --> 00:43:36,154
- Are you OK?
- I'm in one piece.

618
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:40,492
Could really use some family
right about now, and you're it.

619
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:43,537
Who am I right now?
Dexter Morgan, serial killer,

620
00:43:43,663 --> 00:43:45,956
or Dexter Morgan, brother?

621
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:50,210
I'm on my way.

622
00:44:22,118 --> 00:44:23,744
I need to be a good brother now

623
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:26,371
so that I can be a good serial killer later.

624
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:51,229
Excuse me.

625
00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:54,107
Could you tell me if there's
a Kyle Butler working here?

626
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:56,068
Sure.

627
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,949
Mm, sorry.
There's no one by that name.

628
00:45:03,076 --> 00:45:05,410
My mistake.

629
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:23,428
Excuse me, sir.

630
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,305
You're good.

631
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:35,482
Hey.

632
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,871
I'm afraid to erase his name.

633
00:45:55,837 --> 00:45:57,796
Why?

634
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:01,800
'Cause then this is all over.

635
00:46:03,803 --> 00:46:05,137
I guess it is.

636
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:10,851
And Frank's still dead.

637
00:46:10,977 --> 00:46:13,478
Yeah. He is.

638
00:46:18,151 --> 00:46:19,484
I mean...

639
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:22,487
I'm not stupid.

640
00:46:25,575 --> 00:46:28,702
I knew finding his killer
wouldn't bring him back, but...

641
00:46:35,001 --> 00:46:37,294
I thought it would bring something.

642
00:46:48,014 --> 00:46:49,514
You want me to do it?

643
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:53,935
Yeah.

644
00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:00,358
No.

645
00:47:07,408 --> 00:47:09,409
I've got it.

646
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:58,959
Hey, hang tough, hermano.

647
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:56,516
My, my.

648
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:15,452
Why, Mr. Beaudry...

649
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:19,080
you've done me a kindness.

650
00:49:36,182 --> 00:49:37,223
No.

651
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,126
Hello...

652
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:08,546
Dexter Morgan.
