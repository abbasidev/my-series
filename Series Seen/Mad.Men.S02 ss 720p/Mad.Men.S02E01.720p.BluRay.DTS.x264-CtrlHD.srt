1
00:01:31,535 --> 00:01:33,025
Sit up straight.

2
00:01:34,672 --> 00:01:37,539
Heels down. Lighten your hands.

3
00:01:39,777 --> 00:01:41,335
Good girl.

4
00:01:44,081 --> 00:01:45,946
There we go.

5
00:01:48,085 --> 00:01:50,383
Now, if you can step over here.

6
00:01:58,229 --> 00:01:59,560
You're a big one.

7
00:01:59,663 --> 00:02:00,960
Thank you, Lilly.

8
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:04,293
Have a seat.

9
00:02:05,769 --> 00:02:07,532
So, Mr. Draper,

10
00:02:07,638 --> 00:02:11,096
you haven't had a physical
in quite some time.

11
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:12,539
I eat a lot of apples.

12
00:02:13,978 --> 00:02:16,139
What is it with you boys?

13
00:02:16,247 --> 00:02:19,182
Why does it take an insurance physical
to get you in here?

14
00:02:32,496 --> 00:02:33,588
What's the number?

15
00:02:34,965 --> 00:02:37,263
Because that will
mean something to you?

16
00:02:37,368 --> 00:02:38,960
It's 160 over 100,

17
00:02:39,069 --> 00:02:40,661
which is high for boys our age.

18
00:02:40,771 --> 00:02:42,636
Tell me about your parents.

19
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,332
Living or deceased?

20
00:02:44,441 --> 00:02:45,806
Dead. Both.

21
00:02:45,909 --> 00:02:47,001
Ages?

22
00:02:47,111 --> 00:02:48,976
My dad was 41, 42.

23
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,478
He died in an accident,

24
00:02:50,581 --> 00:02:52,606
and my mother died in childbirth.

25
00:02:52,716 --> 00:02:54,411
She was 22, I think.

26
00:02:54,518 --> 00:02:56,679
How many drinks do you have a day?

27
00:02:56,787 --> 00:02:58,584
Wine, cocktails, beer.

28
00:02:58,689 --> 00:03:01,817
Everything depends on the day.

29
00:03:01,925 --> 00:03:04,416
Days of plenty being?

30
00:03:04,528 --> 00:03:06,052
Three.

31
00:03:06,163 --> 00:03:09,030
You're a high-powered businessman
with a high-tension job.

32
00:03:09,133 --> 00:03:11,101
I'm trying to help you here.

33
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:12,225
Five.

34
00:03:12,336 --> 00:03:14,201
And two packs a day,
but you're cutting down.

35
00:03:14,305 --> 00:03:15,670
Yes.

36
00:03:15,773 --> 00:03:17,070
All right.

37
00:03:17,174 --> 00:03:19,574
Any changes in the last year?

38
00:03:19,677 --> 00:03:20,701
What do you mean?

39
00:03:20,811 --> 00:03:21,903
In your health.

40
00:03:22,012 --> 00:03:24,537
How do you feel when
you wake up in the morning?

41
00:03:24,648 --> 00:03:25,672
How do you feel?

42
00:03:25,783 --> 00:03:27,444
You live too hard,

43
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:28,813
and not just at the office.

44
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:31,547
It'll hit you all at once.

45
00:03:34,191 --> 00:03:38,423
Nope. No, I've been... I've been good.

46
00:03:38,529 --> 00:03:42,932
All right, I'm going to write you
some reserpine to bring that down

47
00:03:43,033 --> 00:03:46,469
and some phenobarbital to help you relax.

48
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,595
You're 36 years old.

49
00:03:48,706 --> 00:03:51,732
You need to take this seriously.

50
00:03:51,842 --> 00:03:54,037
Buy a boat.

51
00:03:54,144 --> 00:03:55,702
Breathe in.

52
00:03:58,215 --> 00:04:00,240
So I wait for Becky to go play,

53
00:04:00,351 --> 00:04:01,875
and I look in her pencil case.

54
00:04:01,985 --> 00:04:03,714
There's almost 20 dimes.

55
00:04:03,821 --> 00:04:05,584
She stopped eating lunch.

56
00:04:05,689 --> 00:04:07,782
I hate the dishonesty.

57
00:04:07,891 --> 00:04:09,825
You should be glad
she watches what she eats.

58
00:04:09,927 --> 00:04:11,986
That's the truth. She is slimming down.

59
00:04:12,096 --> 00:04:13,529
Good morning, ladies.

60
00:04:14,832 --> 00:04:16,993
You want to get off right here?

61
00:04:17,101 --> 00:04:18,659
You can go right to your car.

62
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:20,896
No.

63
00:04:24,241 --> 00:04:26,141
He's a prisoner of war.

64
00:04:26,243 --> 00:04:28,177
Because he can't ride.

65
00:04:28,278 --> 00:04:30,439
A man that age doesn't
suddenly take this up.

66
00:04:30,547 --> 00:04:32,378
He's 25.

67
00:04:32,483 --> 00:04:33,848
Did he tell you that?

68
00:04:33,951 --> 00:04:35,612
I think so.

69
00:04:35,719 --> 00:04:37,983
He talks to me. He's engaged.

70
00:04:38,088 --> 00:04:40,716
There's no point in being aloof.

71
00:04:40,824 --> 00:04:43,384
I wouldn't know what to talk about.

72
00:04:43,494 --> 00:04:46,463
Aren't you funny? Are you scandalized?

73
00:04:46,563 --> 00:04:48,554
No.

74
00:04:48,665 --> 00:04:50,997
Well, if you must know,
we talk about you

75
00:04:51,101 --> 00:04:53,331
and how Gertie has a crush on you.

76
00:04:53,437 --> 00:04:55,371
She's a sadist.

77
00:04:55,472 --> 00:04:56,996
I'll see you Saturday.

78
00:04:59,042 --> 00:05:01,010
Don't you hate getting manure in that?

79
00:05:01,111 --> 00:05:04,137
Little children. What's the difference?

80
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:17,886
Look, miss,
just tell me where you want it.

81
00:05:17,995 --> 00:05:20,623
I could take out the lockers
and use that wall.

82
00:05:20,731 --> 00:05:21,891
The break room?

83
00:05:21,999 --> 00:05:23,227
Don't take away the break room.

84
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,324
I'm not taking away anything.

85
00:05:25,436 --> 00:05:27,631
Believe me, this machine
is a gift to you girls.

86
00:05:27,738 --> 00:05:30,138
Happy Valentine's, girls.

87
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,174
How are you going to wear
that around your neck?

88
00:05:32,276 --> 00:05:34,005
It's much bigger than they said it was.

89
00:05:34,111 --> 00:05:35,305
I think it needs an office.

90
00:05:35,412 --> 00:05:36,879
Come on.

91
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,471
We're already doubling up.
Don't do that.

92
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,551
My roommate works at Ernst & Ernst.

93
00:05:41,652 --> 00:05:43,847
She did her birthday party
invitations on this.

94
00:05:43,954 --> 00:05:45,421
On colored paper.

95
00:05:45,522 --> 00:05:48,753
I told you, miss,
I'll try as many places as you want.

96
00:05:50,594 --> 00:05:53,222
Maybe we should leave it
here for the time being.

97
00:06:06,643 --> 00:06:08,304
I don't care. I'm doing this.

98
00:06:08,412 --> 00:06:12,872
If you think that if you start eating,
we're all going to join you, you're wrong.

99
00:06:12,983 --> 00:06:15,816
Look, Don's not one
to stand on ceremony.

100
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,750
He's not going to care.

101
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:20,380
I made it. I knew Draper would be late.

102
00:06:20,491 --> 00:06:21,958
I have some crackers in my desk.

103
00:06:23,427 --> 00:06:24,951
So, burning the midnight oil.

104
00:06:25,062 --> 00:06:26,689
S'all right.

105
00:06:26,797 --> 00:06:28,196
Hope the words are good

106
00:06:28,298 --> 00:06:29,492
'cause he ain't got any artwork.

107
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,397
You didn't have time to give it to Art?

108
00:06:31,502 --> 00:06:34,062
You want to start living here?

109
00:06:34,171 --> 00:06:37,629
I'm supposed to be at The Pen and Pencil
by 12:30 every day.

110
00:06:37,741 --> 00:06:38,867
I was promised.

111
00:06:38,976 --> 00:06:40,876
Look, Freddie, the eating is the thing.

112
00:06:40,978 --> 00:06:42,343
I'm sure you can have a drink.

113
00:06:42,446 --> 00:06:44,277
It's an unspoken agreement.

114
00:06:44,381 --> 00:06:46,281
I got you, Freddie.

115
00:06:48,418 --> 00:06:50,045
Are these all the glasses, Peggy?

116
00:06:51,221 --> 00:06:52,415
I don't know.

117
00:06:52,523 --> 00:06:54,150
We have artwork.

118
00:06:56,927 --> 00:07:00,021
Peggy, go see if we can expect Don today.

119
00:07:05,536 --> 00:07:07,003
That's a good idea.

120
00:07:07,104 --> 00:07:09,664
Draper's not going to yell at her.

121
00:07:09,773 --> 00:07:11,866
You want to be alone with that?

122
00:07:11,975 --> 00:07:13,806
I'm telling you, Draper knocked her up.

123
00:07:13,911 --> 00:07:15,401
She goes away for a couple of months,

124
00:07:15,512 --> 00:07:17,173
drops about 9 pounds, 8 ounces,

125
00:07:17,281 --> 00:07:18,646
comes back with a job.

126
00:07:18,749 --> 00:07:20,979
Don's been screwing me
for the last three years.

127
00:07:21,084 --> 00:07:22,176
I've got nothing.

128
00:07:24,454 --> 00:07:25,853
What's everybody laughing at?

129
00:07:25,956 --> 00:07:29,619
The great debate wages on
about Peggy Olson's charmed career.

130
00:07:29,726 --> 00:07:31,626
Fat farm.

131
00:07:31,728 --> 00:07:33,457
I thought we had verification.

132
00:07:35,933 --> 00:07:38,265
Do you have any idea when
you'll be expecting Mr. Draper?

133
00:07:38,368 --> 00:07:41,166
I was expecting him
at the beginning of work today,

134
00:07:41,271 --> 00:07:43,865
but then he called and said he'd be late.

135
00:07:43,974 --> 00:07:46,033
He said he was going to the movies.

136
00:07:46,143 --> 00:07:47,701
Pinocchio.

137
00:07:48,745 --> 00:07:50,542
Thank you.

138
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,285
Are you insinuating something?

139
00:07:59,556 --> 00:08:02,491
I wasn't doing anything, I don't think.

140
00:08:02,593 --> 00:08:05,027
Well, I believe that.

141
00:08:05,128 --> 00:08:06,425
I want you to imagine,

142
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:07,690
when you talk about Mr. Draper,

143
00:08:07,798 --> 00:08:10,028
that he's standing right behind you.

144
00:08:10,133 --> 00:08:11,998
And think about that
whenever you speak of him.

145
00:08:12,102 --> 00:08:14,764
Are you going to tell on me?

146
00:08:14,871 --> 00:08:16,998
I didn't know. What did I do?

147
00:08:17,107 --> 00:08:18,597
Do you know where Mr. Draper is?

148
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:20,199
No, I don't.

149
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,437
I think he was joking.

150
00:08:22,546 --> 00:08:26,983
Lois, do you know where Mr. Draper is?

151
00:08:29,586 --> 00:08:31,349
He's out.

152
00:08:31,455 --> 00:08:33,821
Thank you, Lois.

153
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:01,083
How is it?

154
00:09:02,552 --> 00:09:03,985
He wrote some of it here.

155
00:09:04,087 --> 00:09:08,524
Some of it on 23rd Street,
some place they tore down.

156
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:11,719
Makes you feel better
about sitting in a bar at lunch.

157
00:09:11,828 --> 00:09:14,126
Makes you feel like you're
getting something done.

158
00:09:14,231 --> 00:09:17,428
Yeah. It's all about getting things done.

159
00:09:20,003 --> 00:09:22,233
Is it good?

160
00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:25,069
I don't think you'd like it.

161
00:09:32,049 --> 00:09:33,778
You wanted to see me?

162
00:09:33,884 --> 00:09:36,853
I wanted to see that Valentine heart.

163
00:09:36,953 --> 00:09:39,148
On my way out. Anything else?

164
00:09:39,256 --> 00:09:42,123
I'm taking Mona to Lutèce.

165
00:09:42,225 --> 00:09:43,988
Let me hear what the living are up to.

166
00:09:44,094 --> 00:09:45,220
You love her.

167
00:09:45,328 --> 00:09:47,387
What happened to the Jewish doctor?

168
00:09:47,497 --> 00:09:48,725
He's not Jewish.

169
00:09:48,832 --> 00:09:50,163
Not anymore, but he was. Trust me.

170
00:09:50,267 --> 00:09:51,325
Is he still a doctor?

171
00:09:51,435 --> 00:09:52,959
You sound like a little girl.

172
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,196
What do you care?

173
00:09:55,272 --> 00:09:57,672
I wish you every happiness.

174
00:09:57,774 --> 00:10:00,766
I'm well aware this is vicarious.
I already said that.

175
00:10:00,877 --> 00:10:03,004
I already know what day
he's going to ask me.

176
00:10:03,113 --> 00:10:04,512
Does he know that?

177
00:10:04,614 --> 00:10:07,913
Because I have a feeling
there's a penalty for passing that date.

178
00:10:08,018 --> 00:10:10,885
He knows.

179
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:14,983
Mr. Phillips here to see you.

180
00:10:15,092 --> 00:10:16,218
Send him in.

181
00:10:18,261 --> 00:10:19,990
Joan.

182
00:10:20,097 --> 00:10:21,462
Did you girls get my candy?

183
00:10:21,565 --> 00:10:24,534
Yes. It was appreciated
and yet unappreciated.

184
00:10:24,634 --> 00:10:26,431
Anything else?

185
00:10:26,536 --> 00:10:29,471
No, thank you. That'll be all.

186
00:10:29,573 --> 00:10:31,404
Got a second?

187
00:10:34,244 --> 00:10:36,474
Nothing good ever started
with that sentence.

188
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,048
It's not that. It's Martinson's Coffee.

189
00:10:39,149 --> 00:10:41,709
I'm excited about the possibility
of that happening,

190
00:10:41,818 --> 00:10:43,080
and, as you recall,

191
00:10:43,186 --> 00:10:44,813
Martinson's Coffee has a unique problem.

192
00:10:44,921 --> 00:10:47,151
Good. We like that.

193
00:10:47,257 --> 00:10:48,656
Well, that's just it.

194
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:50,920
No one under 25 drinks coffee anymore.

195
00:10:51,027 --> 00:10:52,358
Just Pepsi.

196
00:10:52,462 --> 00:10:53,861
They pour it on their Frosted Flakes.

197
00:10:53,964 --> 00:10:56,364
For those who think young.

198
00:10:56,466 --> 00:10:57,956
Which is why I was
disappointed to see Don

199
00:10:58,068 --> 00:10:59,467
put Fred Rumsen on this.

200
00:10:59,569 --> 00:11:01,196
So Freddie doesn't drink coffee.

201
00:11:01,304 --> 00:11:02,703
He doesn't wear a bra, either.

202
00:11:02,806 --> 00:11:04,569
He managed to do a good job on Playtex.

203
00:11:04,674 --> 00:11:06,904
It's frustrating not to have
young people around here.

204
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,136
We're a young country.

205
00:11:08,245 --> 00:11:09,337
The president has a baby.

206
00:11:09,446 --> 00:11:10,640
Have you been out there?

207
00:11:10,747 --> 00:11:12,612
It's rotten with kids.

208
00:11:12,716 --> 00:11:14,547
And the cologne they wear.

209
00:11:14,651 --> 00:11:16,744
Real kids. 25. Even less.

210
00:11:16,853 --> 00:11:18,013
Maybe one of those teams.

211
00:11:18,121 --> 00:11:19,782
The writer and the artist together.

212
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,448
Clients keep bringing it up.

213
00:11:21,558 --> 00:11:24,049
Talk to Don about it.
Just for Martinson's Coffee alone.

214
00:11:24,161 --> 00:11:26,493
Can't you talk to Don about it?

215
00:11:26,596 --> 00:11:28,530
I thought this was the way
things were done here.

216
00:11:28,632 --> 00:11:30,793
Didn't you tell me you were a bridge
between Accounts and Don?

217
00:11:30,901 --> 00:11:33,495
Doesn't sound like me.

218
00:11:33,603 --> 00:11:35,400
Look, Don has talent.

219
00:11:35,505 --> 00:11:37,439
You know how to deal
with that, don't you?

220
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:38,599
Just assume that he knows

221
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:40,437
as much about business as you do,

222
00:11:40,544 --> 00:11:43,604
but inside there's a child
who likes getting his way.

223
00:11:43,713 --> 00:11:45,908
He's not my first creative director.

224
00:11:46,016 --> 00:11:48,780
This is about a sales reality
and not personal territory.

225
00:11:48,885 --> 00:11:52,321
It's what the clients are asking for,
and we need to have it.

226
00:11:52,422 --> 00:11:55,391
What's the best way to make it happen?

227
00:11:59,095 --> 00:12:00,289
Mr. Draper.

228
00:12:00,397 --> 00:12:01,523
Any calls?

229
00:12:01,631 --> 00:12:03,030
Yes, and there was your 12:00

230
00:12:03,133 --> 00:12:04,828
in the conference room.

231
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,802
Of course.

232
00:12:16,847 --> 00:12:19,281
Well, girls can say whatever they want.

233
00:12:19,382 --> 00:12:20,542
They want the chocolates.

234
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,447
Right, Peggy?

235
00:12:22,552 --> 00:12:23,951
Of course they do.

236
00:12:24,054 --> 00:12:26,955
I don't do anything.
Keeps them off balance.

237
00:12:27,057 --> 00:12:28,684
Hey, chief.

238
00:12:30,694 --> 00:12:31,854
Sorry we're late.

239
00:12:31,962 --> 00:12:35,762
I think the little ones need to eat.

240
00:12:35,866 --> 00:12:37,891
What do we have? Dale, wake up.

241
00:12:38,001 --> 00:12:39,832
I could just go.

242
00:12:39,936 --> 00:12:41,460
Or Kinsey.

243
00:12:41,571 --> 00:12:43,038
You want to go first?

244
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:45,633
Peggy.

245
00:12:45,742 --> 00:12:48,336
I just wrote copy for Dale.

246
00:12:52,382 --> 00:12:56,580
Well, this is kind of the gist,
because I was...

247
00:12:56,686 --> 00:12:58,620
Well, we were...

248
00:12:58,722 --> 00:13:00,019
It just kept changing course.

249
00:13:02,292 --> 00:13:05,819
"Mohawk Airlines.
There's a new chief in the sky."

250
00:13:05,929 --> 00:13:08,693
And I thought, following that,

251
00:13:08,798 --> 00:13:10,698
"Most routes to Boston.

252
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,825
Circle the wagons,
we've got it surrounded."

253
00:13:12,936 --> 00:13:16,531
And there'd be wagons
around a dot that says "Boston."

254
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,505
I can almost picture it. Sal.

255
00:13:18,608 --> 00:13:20,371
This is the first time
I'm hearing it, too.

256
00:13:20,477 --> 00:13:23,310
So it's about an airline
that's flown by Indians?

257
00:13:23,413 --> 00:13:26,348
Maybe a plane with some arrows
stuck in the cargo door?

258
00:13:26,449 --> 00:13:27,643
That's funny.

259
00:13:27,751 --> 00:13:30,515
That's what gets people's
attention now, right?

260
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,814
There has to be advertising

261
00:13:31,922 --> 00:13:33,685
for people who don't
have a sense of humor.

262
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,984
I understand, Don.

263
00:13:35,091 --> 00:13:36,718
What else you got?

264
00:13:36,826 --> 00:13:38,953
Several more Indian puns.

265
00:13:39,062 --> 00:13:41,553
Stop writing for other writers.

266
00:13:46,002 --> 00:13:48,436
Luxury, service.

267
00:13:48,538 --> 00:13:50,733
A lot of people are afraid of turbulence,

268
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,364
so it's dead calm.

269
00:13:52,475 --> 00:13:54,909
Look how level those drinks are.

270
00:13:55,011 --> 00:13:56,808
"Wherever Mohawk takes us."

271
00:13:56,913 --> 00:13:58,403
Or, "You'll love getting there."

272
00:13:58,515 --> 00:13:59,709
What's outside that window?

273
00:13:59,816 --> 00:14:01,875
- Fluffy clouds.
- Research.

274
00:14:01,985 --> 00:14:04,613
I get on a plane,
I don't care where I'm going.

275
00:14:04,721 --> 00:14:07,212
I just want to see the city
disappearing behind me.

276
00:14:07,324 --> 00:14:10,157
So we could take the clouds
out of there and put in the city.

277
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,557
The Chrysler Building.

278
00:14:12,662 --> 00:14:14,630
That Indian...

279
00:14:16,099 --> 00:14:20,468
It's not about the majestic beauty
of the Mohawk Nation.

280
00:14:23,873 --> 00:14:26,865
It's about adventure.

281
00:14:26,977 --> 00:14:29,878
Could be a pirate.

282
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,447
Could be a knight in shining armor.

283
00:14:31,548 --> 00:14:35,780
Could be a conquistador
getting off of a boat.

284
00:14:37,387 --> 00:14:39,150
It's about a fantastical people

285
00:14:39,255 --> 00:14:42,952
who are taking you someplace
where you've never been.

286
00:14:52,035 --> 00:14:54,765
We could dress the stew
as Pocahontas.

287
00:14:54,871 --> 00:14:56,270
With the cheekbones.

288
00:14:56,373 --> 00:14:58,000
How's his wife going to feel about that?

289
00:14:58,108 --> 00:15:01,134
Air travel's too expensive
to waste on your wife.

290
00:15:01,244 --> 00:15:02,939
You want to get
on a plane to feel alive.

291
00:15:03,046 --> 00:15:06,243
You want to get on a plane
to see just the hint of a woman's thigh

292
00:15:06,349 --> 00:15:09,682
because her skirt
is just this much too short.

293
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,185
Friday?

294
00:15:12,288 --> 00:15:14,415
Tomorrow.

295
00:15:16,426 --> 00:15:18,257
What does that mean?

296
00:15:18,361 --> 00:15:21,262
It means you want to go somewhere,
go up her skirt.

297
00:15:21,364 --> 00:15:23,491
That's the impression I got.

298
00:15:26,636 --> 00:15:29,298
Carla, Bobby's turning blue out there.

299
00:15:31,141 --> 00:15:33,132
Did somebody get a lot of valentines?

300
00:15:33,243 --> 00:15:36,337
They made everybody
give one to everybody else.

301
00:15:36,446 --> 00:15:38,209
That defeats the purpose.

302
00:15:38,314 --> 00:15:39,611
They had a party.

303
00:15:39,716 --> 00:15:42,048
I see. Fruit punch?

304
00:15:42,152 --> 00:15:43,676
I'm making this for Daddy.

305
00:15:43,787 --> 00:15:44,947
It's beautiful.

306
00:15:45,055 --> 00:15:47,046
I'll see that he gets it.

307
00:15:47,157 --> 00:15:49,148
Mommy, can I do it?

308
00:15:49,259 --> 00:15:50,692
Okay.

309
00:15:54,764 --> 00:15:56,664
I want to go riding with you.

310
00:15:56,766 --> 00:15:58,791
- You can't.
- Well, why?

311
00:15:58,902 --> 00:16:00,961
Well, for one thing, it's too dangerous.

312
00:16:01,071 --> 00:16:02,561
No, it's not.

313
00:16:02,672 --> 00:16:06,403
Do you remember what happened
to the little girl in Gone With the Wind?

314
00:16:08,044 --> 00:16:09,739
You are taking a bath tonight.

315
00:16:18,721 --> 00:16:21,986
They say once you start drinking alone,
you're an alcoholic.

316
00:16:22,092 --> 00:16:24,060
I'm really trying to avoid that.

317
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,060
So I guess I'm helping both of us.

318
00:16:26,162 --> 00:16:28,824
Cooper wants younger people.

319
00:16:28,932 --> 00:16:30,058
For what purpose?

320
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:31,565
Martinson's Coffee.

321
00:16:31,668 --> 00:16:34,136
Last time Freddie Rumsen
had a cup of coffee,

322
00:16:34,237 --> 00:16:37,331
it was one of five being poured
down his throat by a cop.

323
00:16:39,008 --> 00:16:42,671
Well, young campaigns don't necessarily
come from young people.

324
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:43,905
The clients like it.

325
00:16:44,013 --> 00:16:47,813
The clients like the thrill of young talent.

326
00:16:47,917 --> 00:16:49,612
So what am I supposed to do?

327
00:16:49,719 --> 00:16:50,879
Dangle a Pepsi out the window

328
00:16:50,987 --> 00:16:52,818
and see if I can hook a stroller?

329
00:16:52,922 --> 00:16:54,787
I have some candidates.

330
00:16:56,092 --> 00:16:57,389
This smells like Accounts to me.

331
00:16:57,494 --> 00:16:59,462
I had Paul Kinsey make up a list.

332
00:16:59,562 --> 00:17:01,826
He had no idea he was signing
his own death warrant.

333
00:17:03,032 --> 00:17:04,397
You want younger people than that?

334
00:17:04,501 --> 00:17:06,731
What do you want me to say?

335
00:17:06,836 --> 00:17:11,500
Tell Duck clients don't understand.

336
00:17:11,608 --> 00:17:16,671
Their success is related to standing out,
not fitting in.

337
00:17:16,779 --> 00:17:18,872
It's a fad.

338
00:17:18,982 --> 00:17:20,279
Paint him a picture.

339
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:24,843
Something like one wants to be
the needle in the haystack,

340
00:17:24,954 --> 00:17:26,751
not a haystack.

341
00:17:26,856 --> 00:17:29,654
Donald, isn't it possible
that the recently weaned

342
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:32,455
have some unique perspective?

343
00:17:32,562 --> 00:17:34,553
Joy, enthusiasm.

344
00:17:34,664 --> 00:17:37,155
You're talking as if they're
some fresh version of us.

345
00:17:37,267 --> 00:17:38,962
They're not.

346
00:17:39,068 --> 00:17:43,869
Young people don't know anything,
especially that they're young.

347
00:17:43,973 --> 00:17:50,071
Well, let me set this
in a more appealing context for you.

348
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,114
Prove him wrong.

349
00:19:08,691 --> 00:19:10,454
Happy Valentine's Day.

350
00:19:17,667 --> 00:19:18,964
I love this place.

351
00:19:19,068 --> 00:19:20,228
I know.

352
00:19:20,336 --> 00:19:21,428
So what are we doing?

353
00:19:21,537 --> 00:19:25,371
Don't worry, we will be out of here
before the singer starts.

354
00:19:26,509 --> 00:19:28,477
Juanita?

355
00:19:28,578 --> 00:19:30,739
Betsy Hofstadt.

356
00:19:30,847 --> 00:19:33,179
Look at you.

357
00:19:33,283 --> 00:19:34,409
This is so nice.

358
00:19:34,517 --> 00:19:36,747
Don, believe it or not, you two have met.

359
00:19:36,853 --> 00:19:38,115
I don't think we have, Bets.

360
00:19:38,221 --> 00:19:39,415
- Don Draper.
- Hello.

361
00:19:39,522 --> 00:19:40,580
A pleasure to meet you.

362
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:41,714
A pleasure.

363
00:19:41,824 --> 00:19:44,019
Juanita was one of my roommates
when I lived on the West Side.

364
00:19:44,127 --> 00:19:45,560
We were models together.

365
00:19:45,662 --> 00:19:47,186
In that horrible apartment.

366
00:19:47,297 --> 00:19:48,457
Do you live in the city?

367
00:19:48,564 --> 00:19:49,929
Well, I do.

368
00:19:50,033 --> 00:19:51,227
Curtis is from Detroit.

369
00:19:51,334 --> 00:19:53,165
Automobiles.

370
00:19:53,269 --> 00:19:54,827
How are you?

371
00:19:54,937 --> 00:19:57,337
I work as a decorator.

372
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,600
How exciting.

373
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:01,006
I have a little girl and boy.

374
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:03,044
Of course you do.

375
00:20:03,146 --> 00:20:06,274
It looks like everything's going well.

376
00:20:06,382 --> 00:20:07,940
My God, that stone.

377
00:20:08,051 --> 00:20:10,019
That was a gift.

378
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:12,110
Give me your phone number.

379
00:20:12,221 --> 00:20:14,052
Tell me how I can reach you.

380
00:20:14,157 --> 00:20:17,285
Does anyone have a business card?

381
00:20:20,596 --> 00:20:22,086
I do.

382
00:20:26,469 --> 00:20:29,529
I would love a nice long lunch.

383
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,608
So nice to see you.

384
00:20:40,216 --> 00:20:43,117
That is not who I thought
she would end up with.

385
00:20:43,219 --> 00:20:45,016
I don't think it's permanent.

386
00:20:46,556 --> 00:20:50,048
Can you imagine still dating at our age?

387
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,286
She's a party girl, Bets.

388
00:20:54,997 --> 00:20:56,294
Really?

389
00:20:56,399 --> 00:20:57,991
Really.

390
00:20:58,101 --> 00:21:00,160
And how do you know that?

391
00:21:03,106 --> 00:21:04,664
Well?

392
00:21:04,774 --> 00:21:07,004
How stupid do you think I am?

393
00:21:10,213 --> 00:21:11,805
Juanita Carson.

394
00:21:18,554 --> 00:21:20,385
Should I get another one here?

395
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:21,957
What are we doing?

396
00:21:23,526 --> 00:21:26,222
How does room service sound?

397
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:06,097
I came prepared.

398
00:22:12,508 --> 00:22:14,840
I suppose people get lonely.

399
00:22:14,944 --> 00:22:17,003
And it's Valentine's Day.

400
00:22:17,113 --> 00:22:19,980
Be mine for $100.

401
00:22:20,082 --> 00:22:22,073
How much is it, do you think?

402
00:22:24,787 --> 00:22:28,848
I told her I wanted to have
hundreds of babies with you.

403
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,140
Wow.

404
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:55,778
Hello, lovely.

405
00:22:55,885 --> 00:22:57,512
Hello.

406
00:23:03,226 --> 00:23:05,990
Happy Valentine's.

407
00:23:06,095 --> 00:23:07,585
That's so sweet.

408
00:23:07,697 --> 00:23:09,062
I got your little note.

409
00:23:09,165 --> 00:23:11,690
Well, Hildy did.

410
00:23:11,801 --> 00:23:17,000
You have to be careful
about just putting things in my bag.

411
00:23:17,106 --> 00:23:19,301
Come on, open them. I want one.

412
00:23:19,408 --> 00:23:21,069
Okay.

413
00:23:29,085 --> 00:23:31,212
The round ones are coconut.

414
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,619
Should've got the kind
where they put that chart in the box.

415
00:23:34,724 --> 00:23:37,158
I spoke with Jennifer Crane.

416
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,125
She's expecting.

417
00:23:39,228 --> 00:23:40,388
That's impossible.

418
00:23:40,496 --> 00:23:41,656
Harry didn't tell me anything.

419
00:23:41,764 --> 00:23:43,925
That's because he doesn't know.

420
00:23:44,033 --> 00:23:47,491
She's going to surprise him tonight.

421
00:23:49,605 --> 00:23:51,573
I just got so distracted.

422
00:23:51,674 --> 00:23:53,232
Dinner's not for an hour.

423
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,977
Tweety.

424
00:24:00,349 --> 00:24:02,943
There's no reason that's bad for us.

425
00:24:05,254 --> 00:24:06,846
I saw this dumpy woman
on Second Avenue

426
00:24:06,956 --> 00:24:08,548
by the Hungarian market.

427
00:24:08,658 --> 00:24:10,558
And she had her daughter
pushing a stroller

428
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,321
with a little boy in it.

429
00:24:13,529 --> 00:24:15,087
And she was round.

430
00:24:15,197 --> 00:24:17,529
She was expecting another.

431
00:24:17,633 --> 00:24:21,569
She was just buying fruit
like it was any other day.

432
00:24:21,671 --> 00:24:23,468
The daughter was pregnant.

433
00:24:23,573 --> 00:24:25,336
No.

434
00:24:25,441 --> 00:24:26,874
The mother.

435
00:24:28,711 --> 00:24:31,771
It's this big club they're all in together.

436
00:24:31,881 --> 00:24:34,111
Even her.

437
00:24:34,216 --> 00:24:38,175
Well, rest assured.

438
00:24:38,287 --> 00:24:40,778
She doesn't have what you have.

439
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:42,323
Jennifer Crane does.

440
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,160
Do you really believe that?

441
00:24:49,165 --> 00:24:50,462
I guess not.

442
00:25:24,367 --> 00:25:25,732
Hold on.

443
00:25:27,069 --> 00:25:28,502
What's wrong?

444
00:25:35,911 --> 00:25:38,471
Don, it's okay.

445
00:25:38,581 --> 00:25:40,412
We've got all night.

446
00:26:05,274 --> 00:26:08,835
I wish you would just
tell me what to do.

447
00:26:24,126 --> 00:26:25,616
We drank too much, you know.

448
00:26:25,728 --> 00:26:27,628
I don't even know where I am.

449
00:26:32,168 --> 00:26:33,465
You should eat something.

450
00:26:43,212 --> 00:26:44,338
Hello. Yes.

451
00:26:44,447 --> 00:26:47,416
This is Mr. Draper in room 804.

452
00:26:48,718 --> 00:26:54,452
Yes. Can you send up some vichyssoise
and a BLT on white toast?

453
00:26:54,557 --> 00:26:56,149
No. Shrimp cocktail.

454
00:26:56,258 --> 00:26:57,850
Two of them. Scratch that.

455
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,587
Two shrimp cocktails, please.

456
00:26:59,695 --> 00:27:01,094
Wait a minute.

457
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,765
Hello.

458
00:27:06,869 --> 00:27:09,201
Yeah. Do you have anything special?

459
00:27:09,305 --> 00:27:10,602
Anything out of season?

460
00:27:12,374 --> 00:27:13,898
This piano was designed

461
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:15,533
by Franklin Roosevelt...

462
00:27:17,513 --> 00:27:18,741
Oh, leave that.

463
00:27:18,848 --> 00:27:19,906
That's so complicated.

464
00:27:20,015 --> 00:27:21,073
How about this?

465
00:27:21,183 --> 00:27:23,777
I want a half avocado filled with crabmeat

466
00:27:23,886 --> 00:27:26,616
and a rare petite filet.

467
00:27:26,722 --> 00:27:27,780
Two place settings.

468
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:29,858
And if it's an American company

469
00:27:29,959 --> 00:27:32,359
that you can help, I like to do that.

470
00:27:32,461 --> 00:27:35,487
If it's not, just as long as it's the best.

471
00:27:35,598 --> 00:27:37,498
I rather love this hall.

472
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,500
It has all the colors one thinks of

473
00:27:39,602 --> 00:27:41,399
when one thinks of the White House...

474
00:27:41,504 --> 00:27:44,064
red and white and blue and gold.

475
00:27:44,173 --> 00:27:47,040
It's through this door that
all the heads of state come.

476
00:27:47,143 --> 00:27:49,270
And this is where
the president meets them.

477
00:27:49,378 --> 00:27:52,142
And here is where
the Marine band plays.

478
00:27:52,248 --> 00:27:54,307
They have "Ruffles and Flourishes,"

479
00:27:54,416 --> 00:27:55,906
then "Hail to the Chief."

480
00:27:56,018 --> 00:27:58,145
And then there's a receiving line,

481
00:27:58,254 --> 00:28:00,085
and then everyone goes in to dinner here

482
00:28:00,189 --> 00:28:01,417
in the State Dining Room.

483
00:28:01,524 --> 00:28:02,582
Where's her husband?

484
00:28:02,691 --> 00:28:05,251
...though the table now is not
set up for that many.

485
00:28:05,361 --> 00:28:07,158
Are there many state dinners?

486
00:28:07,263 --> 00:28:08,423
Yes, there are.

487
00:28:08,531 --> 00:28:12,023
There were almost
two a month last year.

488
00:28:12,134 --> 00:28:14,125
This room's interesting

489
00:28:14,236 --> 00:28:16,830
because it has the most
architecturally unity

490
00:28:16,939 --> 00:28:18,304
of any room in the White House.

491
00:28:18,407 --> 00:28:20,204
It's really all 1902

492
00:28:20,309 --> 00:28:23,870
when Theodore Roosevelt
took the great restoration

493
00:28:23,979 --> 00:28:26,607
with McKim, Mead & White.

494
00:28:26,715 --> 00:28:30,173
Which of these pieces
have historical associations?

495
00:28:30,286 --> 00:28:31,480
There are quite a few.

496
00:28:31,587 --> 00:28:32,747
You have to see this.

497
00:28:32,855 --> 00:28:34,117
...Dolly Madison's sofa.

498
00:28:34,223 --> 00:28:35,417
That's Nelly Custis' sofa.

499
00:28:35,524 --> 00:28:36,923
No, I don't.

500
00:28:37,026 --> 00:28:38,186
She was Washington's granddaughter.

501
00:28:38,294 --> 00:28:40,023
I feel so strongly

502
00:28:40,129 --> 00:28:43,155
that the White House
should have as fine a collection.

503
00:28:43,265 --> 00:28:45,597
It's so important, the setting in which

504
00:28:45,701 --> 00:28:48,226
the presidency is
presented to the world.

505
00:28:48,337 --> 00:28:49,668
What do you think it is?

506
00:28:49,772 --> 00:28:51,535
I don't know,

507
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,369
but I'm going to find out.

508
00:28:53,475 --> 00:28:55,943
And now a word from our sponsor.

509
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,557
Their armoire?

510
00:29:02,661 --> 00:29:04,891
I've seen them in Connecticut,
but they're copies.

511
00:29:04,997 --> 00:29:06,396
You know, Jackie has a real one.

512
00:29:06,498 --> 00:29:07,829
In the White House?

513
00:29:07,933 --> 00:29:09,195
I think so.

514
00:29:09,301 --> 00:29:10,563
She seemed nervous.

515
00:29:10,669 --> 00:29:12,637
Even when she saw Jack at the end.

516
00:29:12,738 --> 00:29:14,365
It was like they were playing house.

517
00:29:15,407 --> 00:29:17,466
That's chocolate ice cream.

518
00:29:17,576 --> 00:29:19,066
Or blood.

519
00:29:19,178 --> 00:29:21,009
I couldn't throw it away.

520
00:29:21,113 --> 00:29:22,444
It's French.

521
00:29:23,715 --> 00:29:25,910
We'll call it chocolate ice cream,
and I'll work on it.

522
00:29:28,754 --> 00:29:30,278
Well, I'm sorry we missed it.

523
00:29:30,389 --> 00:29:32,584
No time for television.

524
00:29:32,691 --> 00:29:34,124
Stop rubbing it in.

525
00:29:34,226 --> 00:29:35,784
Really. A room at the Savoy?

526
00:29:35,894 --> 00:29:37,191
That takes thought.

527
00:29:37,296 --> 00:29:39,764
Your night sounded very romantic.

528
00:29:39,865 --> 00:29:43,926
I would describe it
as delightfully disappointing.

529
00:29:44,036 --> 00:29:45,663
There was a time when he overdid it,

530
00:29:45,771 --> 00:29:47,966
but I'll take dull and know where I stand.

531
00:29:48,073 --> 00:29:49,506
I agree.

532
00:29:51,243 --> 00:29:52,835
What?

533
00:29:58,217 --> 00:30:00,412
I ran into this old friend.

534
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:02,009
Juanita Carson.

535
00:30:02,121 --> 00:30:03,418
We were models together.

536
00:30:03,522 --> 00:30:04,614
Roommates.

537
00:30:04,723 --> 00:30:06,782
She was in the lounge of the Savoy.

538
00:30:06,892 --> 00:30:08,086
She didn't look cheap.

539
00:30:08,193 --> 00:30:10,286
Except for this 2-carat stone.

540
00:30:10,395 --> 00:30:12,363
But she wasn't with a date.

541
00:30:12,464 --> 00:30:14,591
She was with a companion.

542
00:30:15,734 --> 00:30:17,599
I don't understand.

543
00:30:17,703 --> 00:30:19,398
Don agreed with me.

544
00:30:19,505 --> 00:30:21,132
He was an old man.

545
00:30:22,741 --> 00:30:24,402
She's a call girl.

546
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:25,807
Really?

547
00:30:27,246 --> 00:30:28,770
Butterfield 8?

548
00:30:28,881 --> 00:30:29,939
I wonder what that's like.

549
00:30:30,048 --> 00:30:32,243
I don't know.

550
00:30:32,351 --> 00:30:34,319
New York... Manhattan... is expensive.

551
00:30:34,419 --> 00:30:36,080
We forget that.

552
00:30:36,188 --> 00:30:39,385
I used to look at people
in restaurants with envy.

553
00:30:39,491 --> 00:30:41,254
Don gave me a fur coat.

554
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,124
If prostitution is Don
showing up with a fur coat,

555
00:30:44,229 --> 00:30:45,491
sign me up.

556
00:30:45,597 --> 00:30:47,155
I don't think it's like that.

557
00:30:47,266 --> 00:30:50,497
I just keep picturing
Juanita at 22 years old.

558
00:30:50,602 --> 00:30:52,593
We shared a room.

559
00:30:52,704 --> 00:30:55,070
Talked in the dark...

560
00:30:55,174 --> 00:30:57,074
I know we wanted the same things.

561
00:30:57,176 --> 00:31:01,044
When I was 22,
whenever I was really low on money,

562
00:31:01,146 --> 00:31:04,411
I would call my father and let him know
that I was going to Havana.

563
00:31:04,516 --> 00:31:09,647
And he would, without fail,
send $25 in cash in the mail.

564
00:31:11,123 --> 00:31:12,681
He wanted you to have a good time.

565
00:31:12,791 --> 00:31:15,055
No. He's a degenerate gambler.

566
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,151
And it would always come
with a list of instructions

567
00:31:17,262 --> 00:31:18,320
of how to bet it.

568
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:19,590
You're kidding me.

569
00:31:19,698 --> 00:31:22,428
No. And he never won
because I never went.

570
00:31:22,534 --> 00:31:24,661
That's criminal.

571
00:31:34,313 --> 00:31:36,372
What's wrong with
the conference room?

572
00:31:36,481 --> 00:31:37,914
Why don't we go to my office?

573
00:31:38,016 --> 00:31:39,142
Plenty of room.

574
00:31:39,251 --> 00:31:40,513
Braggart.

575
00:31:40,619 --> 00:31:43,110
Nope. We're sitting here.

576
00:31:43,222 --> 00:31:45,213
I'm trying to figure something out.

577
00:31:45,324 --> 00:31:49,192
So, Pops, we should celebrate
your soon-to-be-fat wife.

578
00:31:50,229 --> 00:31:51,628
Aren't you happy?

579
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:54,198
Sure. I mean, it's going
to be a lot of headaches.

580
00:31:54,299 --> 00:31:55,857
Things are going to change.
But come on.

581
00:32:02,307 --> 00:32:04,002
He's really meeting with them.

582
00:32:04,109 --> 00:32:05,974
Why are they doing this?

583
00:32:06,078 --> 00:32:09,707
I guess you haven't been privy
to some of Duck's scoutmaster talks

584
00:32:09,815 --> 00:32:11,077
about how we need younger creative.

585
00:32:11,183 --> 00:32:13,674
Who said that? Did he say that?

586
00:32:13,785 --> 00:32:16,117
- A few times.
- Wonderful.

587
00:32:16,221 --> 00:32:18,121
Look, we're in the same boat.

588
00:32:18,223 --> 00:32:20,191
I'm sure he'll turn his sights on us.

589
00:32:20,292 --> 00:32:22,055
No one's been promoted
in Accounts since he came in.

590
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,718
I can't believe Donald
would listen to Duck.

591
00:32:23,829 --> 00:32:25,319
Well, maybe Duck made him.

592
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:27,125
Nobody makes Draper do anything.

593
00:32:27,232 --> 00:32:30,463
Let me tell you, Don Draper
has a rope coiled under his desk,

594
00:32:30,569 --> 00:32:32,560
and it's looped around Duck's neck.

595
00:32:32,671 --> 00:32:35,139
And Duck's going to run around
and run around,

596
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,935
and then one day...

597
00:32:38,443 --> 00:32:41,776
There's a meeting?
Nobody told me there was a meeting.

598
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,405
Can we change venues?

599
00:32:49,087 --> 00:32:53,683
So, I have a lot of thoughts.

600
00:32:53,792 --> 00:32:55,384
How old are you?

601
00:32:55,494 --> 00:32:56,984
25.

602
00:32:57,095 --> 00:32:59,029
24. But that résumé,

603
00:32:59,131 --> 00:33:00,564
that's really just two years.

604
00:33:00,666 --> 00:33:02,566
18 months, without a doubt.

605
00:33:02,668 --> 00:33:03,726
Right.

606
00:33:03,835 --> 00:33:05,132
You're experienced, I gather.

607
00:33:05,237 --> 00:33:06,761
Are you married?

608
00:33:06,872 --> 00:33:09,340
That's why we're on the purpose.

609
00:33:09,441 --> 00:33:10,567
He's right.

610
00:33:10,676 --> 00:33:12,007
We haven't settled down yet.

611
00:33:13,245 --> 00:33:17,773
So, again, you both
did everything together,

612
00:33:17,883 --> 00:33:19,373
and yet you get paid more.

613
00:33:19,484 --> 00:33:21,418
Well, I have a writing background.

614
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,750
Short fiction. And I'm a citizen.

615
00:33:23,855 --> 00:33:26,619
But you contribute words.

616
00:33:26,725 --> 00:33:29,489
Only when it's a distance.

617
00:33:34,499 --> 00:33:36,023
I'm going to ask you a question

618
00:33:36,134 --> 00:33:39,228
that was always asked of me
when I was on job interviews.

619
00:33:39,338 --> 00:33:42,000
That is divine, man.

620
00:33:42,107 --> 00:33:44,575
Have you ever been fired?

621
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:50,170
I believe you that other people
have them in the hallways.

622
00:33:50,282 --> 00:33:52,147
I just don't know if that's right for us.

623
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:53,877
I mean, this is
an environment for clients.

624
00:33:53,985 --> 00:33:56,476
We don't want to appear
to be bursting at the seams.

625
00:33:56,588 --> 00:33:59,682
Lois, may I speak with you?

626
00:34:04,363 --> 00:34:07,457
Theresa said there was
an incident yesterday.

627
00:34:07,566 --> 00:34:08,965
You were crying in the break room,

628
00:34:09,067 --> 00:34:10,364
which I have specifically forbidden.

629
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:11,834
I'm sorry, but Peggy...

630
00:34:11,937 --> 00:34:13,063
Miss Olson.

631
00:34:14,906 --> 00:34:15,998
She yelled at me.

632
00:34:16,108 --> 00:34:18,599
Why would she do that?

633
00:34:20,445 --> 00:34:22,106
I'm good at my job.

634
00:34:22,214 --> 00:34:23,841
The next time
that you come to complain...

635
00:34:23,949 --> 00:34:25,917
I wasn't complaining.
You wanted to talk to me.

636
00:34:26,017 --> 00:34:28,178
This is why I don't allow
crying in the break room.

637
00:34:28,286 --> 00:34:29,514
It erodes morale.

638
00:34:29,621 --> 00:34:31,486
There's a place to do that,
like your apartment.

639
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:33,615
It came over me.

640
00:34:33,725 --> 00:34:36,319
And I would correct your attitude
towards Miss Olson.

641
00:34:36,428 --> 00:34:37,520
It's unbecoming.

642
00:34:37,629 --> 00:34:38,755
Yes, Joan.

643
00:34:41,032 --> 00:34:42,693
Do we like this in the hallway?

644
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:45,731
I think it looks good now,

645
00:34:45,837 --> 00:34:47,737
but I think it will become messy.

646
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,273
I agree.

647
00:34:56,214 --> 00:34:57,647
Looks good.

648
00:34:57,749 --> 00:35:00,547
By the way, it has Julian Koenig's
fingerprints all over it.

649
00:35:00,652 --> 00:35:02,176
His Master's Voice.

650
00:35:02,287 --> 00:35:03,914
Also not mine.

651
00:35:04,022 --> 00:35:05,489
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Smith.

652
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:06,852
Smitty. Kurt.

653
00:35:06,958 --> 00:35:09,722
We have the same last name.
We don't want people to mix us up.

654
00:35:09,828 --> 00:35:12,023
It must happen all the time.
You two share an office?

655
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:13,654
Works best that way.

656
00:35:13,765 --> 00:35:15,130
Look at this.

657
00:35:15,233 --> 00:35:17,463
Gentlemen, your reputations
precede you.

658
00:35:17,569 --> 00:35:19,730
Duck Phillips,
head of Account Services.

659
00:35:19,838 --> 00:35:21,362
I get a distinct impression.

660
00:35:21,473 --> 00:35:22,599
Pardon?

661
00:35:22,707 --> 00:35:25,574
We'd rather people
not know we were here.

662
00:35:25,677 --> 00:35:27,736
If it gets out we're meeting...

663
00:35:27,846 --> 00:35:30,144
- Of course not.
- Yes, right.

664
00:35:30,248 --> 00:35:31,442
Bye.

665
00:35:32,684 --> 00:35:34,982
- I'll let him know she called.
- Okay.

666
00:35:36,388 --> 00:35:37,878
I like the direction you're taking.

667
00:35:37,989 --> 00:35:39,081
Good.

668
00:35:39,191 --> 00:35:42,058
Now that I've given you your babies
and your Xerox machine,

669
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,821
should I throw in
a couple of elephants?

670
00:35:43,929 --> 00:35:45,521
I don't want there to be any excuse

671
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,029
when you can't bring in
Martinson's Coffee.

672
00:35:47,132 --> 00:35:49,362
Don't get worked up.

673
00:35:49,468 --> 00:35:51,459
You know, there are other ways
to think of things

674
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:53,561
than the way you think of them.

675
00:36:01,012 --> 00:36:02,138
The testimonials.

676
00:36:02,247 --> 00:36:04,147
I was thinking we could
get younger girls.

677
00:36:04,249 --> 00:36:05,443
Sixth graders.

678
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:06,812
It would mean different publications.

679
00:36:06,918 --> 00:36:08,385
Do they need Clearasil that early?

680
00:36:08,487 --> 00:36:09,920
- Doesn't matter.
- Doesn't.

681
00:36:10,021 --> 00:36:11,921
I guess we could try that.

682
00:36:12,958 --> 00:36:15,256
Two more from DDB.

683
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,588
Even younger.

684
00:36:16,695 --> 00:36:19,596
Just assume that everyone on the list
you handed Roger is coming in.

685
00:36:19,698 --> 00:36:20,756
You're an idiot.

686
00:36:20,866 --> 00:36:22,834
I don't understand that. I'm only 22.

687
00:36:22,934 --> 00:36:24,731
You don't count.

688
00:36:24,836 --> 00:36:26,394
We've got to get him out of here.

689
00:36:26,505 --> 00:36:27,597
Come on, Daddy.

690
00:36:27,706 --> 00:36:30,140
How often do you get to celebrate
getting some girl pregnant?

691
00:36:30,242 --> 00:36:31,834
Campbell, you're buying.

692
00:36:31,943 --> 00:36:33,774
We still have to show
Mohawk to Mr. Draper.

693
00:36:33,879 --> 00:36:35,039
Dale's not here.

694
00:36:35,146 --> 00:36:36,545
Mr. Draper doesn't care.

695
00:36:41,386 --> 00:36:44,822
Kids. What's the big deal?

696
00:36:44,923 --> 00:36:46,447
Do you want to have kids?

697
00:36:48,059 --> 00:36:50,152
Eventually.

698
00:36:50,262 --> 00:36:51,695
Exactly.

699
00:37:02,874 --> 00:37:04,967
Mr. Romano, Miss Olson.

700
00:37:06,545 --> 00:37:07,842
Send them in.

701
00:37:10,248 --> 00:37:11,545
Where are we?

702
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:13,447
You tell us.

703
00:37:15,887 --> 00:37:17,821
"Where are you going?"

704
00:37:19,925 --> 00:37:21,790
Are you going to underline the "you"?

705
00:37:21,893 --> 00:37:23,656
For half the people, it will be,

706
00:37:23,762 --> 00:37:25,627
"Where are you going?"

707
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:28,597
I also had "Come away with us."

708
00:37:30,535 --> 00:37:31,729
Where the hell's Dale?

709
00:37:33,004 --> 00:37:34,562
He's sick.

710
00:37:36,675 --> 00:37:38,336
I don't know. Sure.

711
00:37:38,443 --> 00:37:39,637
Fine.

712
00:37:39,744 --> 00:37:41,575
It's exactly what we talked about.

713
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,238
It's obvious.

714
00:37:44,482 --> 00:37:46,245
I'm uninvolved.

715
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,757
Move this up.

716
00:37:59,698 --> 00:38:01,256
What about that?

717
00:38:04,169 --> 00:38:05,397
I think it's sentimental.

718
00:38:05,503 --> 00:38:06,868
Peggy.

719
00:38:06,972 --> 00:38:09,497
No, she's right.

720
00:38:09,608 --> 00:38:13,977
Just because it has sentiment
doesn't make it sentimental.

721
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:15,740
We're talking about businessmen.

722
00:38:15,847 --> 00:38:19,283
Right. Businessmen
who like short skirts.

723
00:38:19,384 --> 00:38:20,681
Sex sells.

724
00:38:23,722 --> 00:38:25,121
Says who?

725
00:38:30,895 --> 00:38:31,953
Just so you know,

726
00:38:32,063 --> 00:38:37,296
the people who talk that way
think that monkeys can do this.

727
00:38:37,402 --> 00:38:40,394
And they take all this monkey crap
and just stick it in a briefcase,

728
00:38:40,505 --> 00:38:42,871
completely unaware that their success

729
00:38:42,974 --> 00:38:45,636
depends on something
more than their shoe shine.

730
00:38:54,686 --> 00:38:57,655
You are the product.

731
00:38:57,756 --> 00:39:00,919
You feeling something.

732
00:39:01,026 --> 00:39:02,653
That's what sells.

733
00:39:02,761 --> 00:39:05,059
Not them.

734
00:39:05,163 --> 00:39:07,290
Not sex.

735
00:39:11,302 --> 00:39:13,497
They can't do what we do.

736
00:39:13,605 --> 00:39:15,573
And they hate us for it.

737
00:39:23,982 --> 00:39:26,576
"Welcome back, Daddy"?

738
00:39:26,685 --> 00:39:27,947
Is that a question?

739
00:39:32,691 --> 00:39:35,524
"What did you bring me, Daddy?"

740
00:39:44,035 --> 00:39:46,003
You can put that in your book.

741
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:07,221
What is going on?

742
00:40:34,486 --> 00:40:36,647
He's going to take it to Leon in Actuarial?

743
00:40:36,755 --> 00:40:39,849
His stomach's so fat,
it's now resting on his desk.

744
00:40:39,958 --> 00:40:42,222
Got to feed that big brain.

745
00:40:42,327 --> 00:40:44,659
He's a deal breaker.

746
00:40:44,763 --> 00:40:46,594
I'm a closer.

747
00:40:47,665 --> 00:40:48,791
That Cecelia?

748
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,333
Sits outside Fred Talbot's office?

749
00:40:50,435 --> 00:40:52,096
You made that happen?

750
00:40:52,203 --> 00:40:53,261
Silver tongue.

751
00:40:57,909 --> 00:40:59,672
I got her three stingers.

752
00:40:59,778 --> 00:41:01,006
She's a little girl.

753
00:41:01,112 --> 00:41:02,773
You have to give them an excuse.

754
00:41:02,881 --> 00:41:03,973
That's what I always say.

755
00:41:04,082 --> 00:41:06,209
She had those panties
that said "Wednesday."

756
00:41:06,317 --> 00:41:07,443
They were soaked through.

757
00:41:07,552 --> 00:41:08,849
I love that.

758
00:41:08,953 --> 00:41:10,386
Once the engine was running,

759
00:41:10,488 --> 00:41:11,580
she wouldn't stop.

760
00:41:11,689 --> 00:41:13,088
She's so straight.

761
00:41:13,191 --> 00:41:14,385
You'd think that.

762
00:41:16,127 --> 00:41:17,526
Take your hat off.

763
00:41:20,064 --> 00:41:21,725
Is there a problem?

764
00:41:57,502 --> 00:41:59,094
Damn it.

765
00:42:14,652 --> 00:42:16,347
Everything okay?

766
00:42:16,454 --> 00:42:18,388
You know anything about cars?

767
00:42:18,489 --> 00:42:19,979
No.

768
00:42:21,292 --> 00:42:24,193
Can you tell them at the Esso
to send a tow truck?

769
00:42:24,295 --> 00:42:25,592
Okay.

770
00:42:37,642 --> 00:42:39,041
Hey, Carla.

771
00:42:39,143 --> 00:42:40,804
Hi.

772
00:42:42,213 --> 00:42:44,044
Hey, Daddy.

773
00:42:44,148 --> 00:42:45,672
How was your day, Mr. Draper?

774
00:42:46,784 --> 00:42:49,014
I am tired.

775
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,280
Where's Mrs. Draper?

776
00:42:50,388 --> 00:42:52,982
She just went to get Sally from ballet.

777
00:42:54,225 --> 00:42:55,988
Want a ride to the station?

778
00:42:56,094 --> 00:42:58,892
No. I'm all right.

779
00:42:58,997 --> 00:43:01,295
It's a nice night out. I enjoy the fresh air.

780
00:43:01,399 --> 00:43:02,798
Good night, Bobby.

781
00:43:02,901 --> 00:43:04,095
Good night.

782
00:43:04,202 --> 00:43:05,533
Good night.

783
00:43:13,845 --> 00:43:15,836
I don't like it.

784
00:43:19,284 --> 00:43:22,014
Here. Give it to me.

785
00:43:28,893 --> 00:43:30,884
I just know when the smoke
starts to come out,

786
00:43:30,995 --> 00:43:32,587
I have to stop.

787
00:43:32,697 --> 00:43:33,823
That's true.

788
00:43:33,932 --> 00:43:37,891
I got a fan belt on the truck.
I could put it in for $9.00.

789
00:43:39,003 --> 00:43:40,334
Hold on.

790
00:44:04,395 --> 00:44:06,056
I have $3.00 and change.

791
00:44:06,164 --> 00:44:07,893
I could put it on account,

792
00:44:07,999 --> 00:44:09,296
send you a bill.

793
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,061
I don't want my husband
knowing about this.

794
00:44:11,169 --> 00:44:12,397
It's a new car.

795
00:44:12,503 --> 00:44:14,971
He doesn't like the way I drive.

796
00:44:15,073 --> 00:44:16,904
That's got nothing to do with this.

797
00:44:21,679 --> 00:44:25,046
Well, it would mean the world to me.

798
00:44:25,149 --> 00:44:26,912
I don't know. You know, the...

799
00:44:27,018 --> 00:44:29,578
the belt's 2.55.

800
00:44:30,922 --> 00:44:35,621
So there's nothing you can do
for a damsel in distress?

801
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:41,460
Are we bargaining here?

802
00:44:43,201 --> 00:44:47,900
Well, yes, I guess we are.

803
00:44:48,006 --> 00:44:50,804
I could say no, couldn't I?

804
00:44:52,377 --> 00:44:54,937
That would be
a terrible disappointment.

805
00:44:55,046 --> 00:44:57,344
It would be, wouldn't it?

806
00:45:27,211 --> 00:45:28,803
It's not that complicated.

807
00:45:28,913 --> 00:45:30,540
That's a relief.

808
00:45:43,494 --> 00:45:46,986
Well, that'll do it.

809
00:45:59,277 --> 00:46:01,211
Have a good night now.

810
00:46:01,312 --> 00:46:04,338
I will.

811
00:46:14,625 --> 00:46:16,149
Polly!

812
00:46:18,796 --> 00:46:19,888
I'm here, too.

813
00:46:19,997 --> 00:46:21,055
Hi, Daddy.

814
00:46:21,165 --> 00:46:22,393
Hi.

815
00:46:24,869 --> 00:46:26,166
Bobby conked out.

816
00:46:26,270 --> 00:46:27,601
Where were you?

817
00:46:27,705 --> 00:46:29,002
Mommy was late.

818
00:46:29,107 --> 00:46:33,510
I got stuck talking to Marilyn Keckner
in the parking lot.

819
00:46:33,611 --> 00:46:35,806
Well, I was here.

820
00:46:35,913 --> 00:46:37,210
Did you eat something?

821
00:46:37,315 --> 00:46:38,407
I did.

822
00:46:40,284 --> 00:46:42,718
Come on, show me
what you learned in ballet.

823
00:47:04,375 --> 00:47:05,899
Now I am quietly waiting

824
00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:07,875
for the catastrophe of my personality

825
00:47:07,979 --> 00:47:10,072
to seem beautiful again,

826
00:47:10,181 --> 00:47:12,945
and interesting and modern.

827
00:47:20,525 --> 00:47:22,220
The country is gray

828
00:47:22,326 --> 00:47:26,057
and brown and white and trees.

829
00:47:28,566 --> 00:47:32,627
Snows and skies of laughter
are always diminishing.

830
00:47:32,737 --> 00:47:35,262
Less funny, not just darker.

831
00:47:35,373 --> 00:47:37,364
Not just gray.

832
00:47:39,076 --> 00:47:42,307
It may be the coldest day of the year.

833
00:47:42,413 --> 00:47:45,177
What does he think of that?

834
00:47:45,283 --> 00:47:48,377
I mean, what do I?

835
00:47:49,754 --> 00:47:51,813
And if I do,

836
00:47:51,923 --> 00:47:55,859
perhaps I am myself again.

837
