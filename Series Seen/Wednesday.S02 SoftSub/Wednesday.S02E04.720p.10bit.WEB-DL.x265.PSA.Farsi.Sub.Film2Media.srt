00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:12,429
[foreboding music plays]

2
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:27,819
[Fairburn] Come in!

3
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:37,995
Hmm.

4
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:40,498
-Hmm.
-[chains rattling]

5
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:46,796
I've read your book.

6
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,549
<i>Unlocking the Outcast Mind.</i>

7
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:53,428
It came in very handy when I
was grooming Tyler. [chuckles]

8
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:57,265
You'll forgive me if I don't use that
as a pull quote in the next edition.

9
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:01,352
I thought keeping you two apart would
diminish your emotional hold over him.

10
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,023
But it hasn't, has it?

11
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:08,819
And now you want me to tell you
how to unlock my little monster.

12
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:12,406
I want to know what you did to Tyler,
so that I can rehabilitate him.

13
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:13,656
Rehabilitate?

14
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,076
Is that what you
do here? [scoffs]

15
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,871
I had always heard whispers
that Willow Hill performed

16
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:22,541
secret experiments
on the Outcasts.

17
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:25,710
We also do alien
autopsies in the basement.

18
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,088
Now, are you willing
to help me or not?

19
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:31,091
Only if you'll agree to have me
transferred here permanently,

20
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:33,552
as a patient, and
not a prisoner.

21
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:36,221
That will be for
a jury to decide.

22
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:39,265
I'm sorry we couldn't
make this work.

23
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:43,978
I'll have to find a more
invasive method to unlock Tyler.

24
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:48,025
Arrange her transfer back to
Northern State Correctional.

25
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,527
And please note that I
recommend the prisoner be placed

26
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,863
in solitary confinement
until her trial.

27
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,115
-[guard] Yes, Doctor.
-Ugh.

28
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:58,076
You've made your point.
I'm willing to help.

29
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,661
All I ask is that...

30
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,329
[inhales, exhales deeply]

31
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:04,082
[voice cracking] ...you let
me see Tyler, face-to-face.

32
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:06,043
[chilling music oscillating]

33
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,293
Just once.

34
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,254
Please.

35
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:12,549
[keypad beeping]

36
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,135
[lock clanks]

37
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,555
Tyler.

38
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,120
[exhales slowly]

39
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:44,205
It's okay.

40
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,375
Mama's here.

41
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,544
[chains drag slowly]

42
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,922
Look at what
they've done to you.

43
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,222
[breathing raggedly]

44
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,393
Oh, I know, baby.

45
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,354
I missed you too.

46
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,859
I've been dreaming
about this moment.

47
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:15,278
[Tyler snarls]

48
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,077
Don't hit the shock
collar. It'll kill her.

49
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,249
Easy... Easy, sweetie.

50
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,252
I know you're upset.

51
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,087
Just put Mommy down.

52
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,297
I promise I'll get
you out of here.

53
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,924
[Tyler huffs, snarls]

54
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:39,510
[panting]

[music trails off]

58

[muffled clattering]

59
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,525
Nothing stirs the senses
like a funerary urn.

60
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:24,490
The only people who deserve to be buried
in this dump are the maintenance staff.

61
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,159
Grandmama,

62
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:27,743
you're here.

63
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:31,622
My granddaughter calls up
for dirt on a competitor?

64
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:34,793
You practically
dared me to show up.

65
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,003
[Wednesday] I knew you'd
be working weekends.

66
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:40,173
Death never takes a
holiday, so neither do I.

67
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:44,261
Why are you interested
in this Patricia Redcar?

68
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,387
She's part of my
ongoing investigation.

69
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,558
Look. I found all
of these obituaries.

70
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:53,645
All Outcasts, all
patients at Willow Hill.

71
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,688
They're all cremated
and buried here.

72
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,982
What does this have
to do with you?

73
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,695
I saw a vision of my roommate's
death. Somehow it's all connected.

74
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,488
Please give her my card.

75
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:07,784
I offer a friends and family
discount on all funerals and caskets.

76
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:12,080
If I had my psychic ability back,
I would have solved this already.

77
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,290
My mom's going to
burn Goody's book.

78
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,210
No crying over spilled ashes.

79
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:19,879
You know what I
say about feelings.

80
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:23,674
Bury them deep inside and allow
them to slowly eat away at you.

81
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,595
It's all in the wrist.

82
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,058
Ah.

83
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,435
Shoddy work, I must say. Lumpy.

84
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,105
Hmm. That's odd.

85
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,191
Here, just like I taught you.

86
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,695
Overtones of deer.

87
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:48,324
Hints of squirrel and raccoon.

88
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,453
And a subtle finish of Shih Tzu.

89
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:52,662
Very good.

90
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:53,955
What's missing?

91
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:56,082
[tense music builds]

92
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:57,334

[menacing caw]

95
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:04,382
[Wednesday] My evidence!

[suspenseful music playing]

97

[music trails off]

100
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:29,157
[Hester] A good run through the
tombstones always makes you feel alive.

101
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,118
Was that crow luring you
into a murderous trap?

102
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,495
Varicose and I had wagers.

103
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:36,748
The Avian that controls them
just stole all my evidence.

104
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,500
I've rattled their birdcage.

105
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,627
The plot thickens. What's next?

106
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,963
Buy this cemetery and find out
who authorized those cremations.

107
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,674
Why would I do
something so rash?

108
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:50,387
Once you tell my mother you're finally
getting me into the family business,

109
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,473
all her childhood insecurities
will come bubbling to the surface.

110
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,142
Well played, my dear.

111
00:07:56,809 --> 00:08:01,522
You know exactly how to worm your
way into my cold, desiccated heart.

112
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:06,277
[Wednesday] <i>Usually an obituary
is the end of the story...</i>

114
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,698
<i>...not the beginning of
an even stranger one.</i>

<i>Who faked those
patients' deaths?</i>

118
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:23,628
<i>Who is Lois?</i>

119
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,965
<i>And how was all of this connected
to Enid's impending death?</i>

120
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,595
<i>The sooner I get answers,</i>

121
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,388
<i>the sooner I can save Enid...</i>

122
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,099
Wednesday!

123
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,935
[Wednesday] <i>...who I
currently want to murder.</i>

124
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,855
Didn't you see the
scrunchie on the door?

125
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,065
That's kind of universal
code for "do not disturb."

126
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:45,233
[faint creak]

127
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:50,238
You know I'm not above
using a nail gun.

128
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:56,202
-How long have you been here?
-Somewhere between... [smooches]

129
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:58,704
And... [moaning theatrically]

130
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,582
I'm definitely scarred.

00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,709
[grunts angrily]

132
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,628
-Let's go.
-Stay out of my room, you little creep.

[claws clink]

134
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:09,632
That was strike two.

135
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,718
I was trying to take
mundane tasks off your plate

136
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,678
so you can focus on the case.

137
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,388
Like picking up your mail.

138
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:18,307
Got a letter from your publisher.
Figured you'd want it ASAP.

139

"Dear Miss Addams, we all love
Viper..." Dah-duh-dah-duh-dah...

"You're incredibly difficult to
work with..." Blah-blah-blah...

"Adamant refusal to engage in the
editing and rewriting process..."

Dah-duh-dah-dah-dah.

"Regrettably, I must drop you
as a writer. Please seek help."

144
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:36,741
I'm sorry.

145
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:41,998
Why? I'd rather no one read my
novel than make a compromise.

146
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,582
[crow caws]

147
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,127
Now that this Avian is
aware of our investigation,

148
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,712
we don't have much time.

149
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:50,298
All of our answers are in
the Willow Hill asylum.

150
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,385
And I know just the
lunatic to get them for me.

00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,285
Hello?

154
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:21,871
You rang?

155
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,874
Thanks for coming on
such short notice.

156
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,085
For my favorite niece,

157
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,920
I'm always a lurk away.

158
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,755
I need you to get
into Willow Hill.

159
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,966
Last time I did that
was for your mother.

160
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,051
She wanted me to
check on her sister.

161
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,928
Aunt Ophelia was in there? When?

162
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:42,016
Oh, years ago. She'd flown the
coop by the time I got committed.

163
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,726
I stuck around for a few weeks.

164
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:47,021
They had a top-notch
electroshock therapist, Igor.

165
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,523
He ran a gulag in Siberia.

166
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:51,776
He really knew how to rattle
the old cerebral cortex.

167
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,905
-Nobody sneaks up on me, kid.
-[whimpers]

168
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:56,990
She with you?

169
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,366
This is my stalker.

170
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,910
I turned her into an
unpaid expendable gofer.

171
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:01,828
Huh.

172
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,371
I'm a big fan of child labor.

173
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:06,833
A stampede of chupacabras
makes less noise than you.

174
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:10,711
Learn to hold your breath, and walk
on the seams of the floorboards.

175
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,130
Thanks for the pro-tip.

176
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,717
I took the liberty of getting

Hello?

701
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:08,080
Are you here to kill me?

702
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:13,878
Then leave me alone.

703
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,337
[crow caws]

704
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:21,676
[caws]

705
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:26,057
So you are the new
face of mad doctors.

706
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:29,977
You do realize that Fairburn doesn't roll
off the tongue as nicely as Frankenstein.

707
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:36,817
There's nothing mad
about what I'm doing.

708
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,235
Fairburn works for me.

709
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:41,322
I recruited her to be the
public face of this institution

710
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:43,031
and continue my father's work.

711
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:46,076
You're Augustus
Stonehurst's daughter.

712
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:49,538
That's how you knew about the
secret passages at Nevermore.

713
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:52,166
You must've used them to visit
your aviary in Iago Tower.

714
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:55,336
I have very fond memories of
my father's time at Nevermore.

715
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,670
He loved Outcasts.

716
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:58,464
Evidence to the contrary.

717
00:45:58,547 --> 00:45:59,715
He wanted to be one.

718
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:03,928
Imagine being able to extract their
abilities and share it with Normies.

719
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:06,388
You mean steal them
and exploit them.

720
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:09,558
This is a basement bargain
attempt at Dr. Moreau.

721
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:12,561
I did more than just
attempt. [laughs]

722
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:14,146
I am living proof.

723
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:15,564
I was born a Normie,

724
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:18,109
and thanks to my father's work,

725
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:22,196
my beautiful black-winged
friends obey my every whim.

726

Experimenting on
his own daughter.

727
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:26,325
That's twisted.

728
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:28,244
Even by my own sick standards.

729
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:30,246
[tuts] I volunteered!

730
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:32,123
My father and I were a team.

731
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:33,833
He needed a subject.

732
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:35,835
I wanted to be
part of his legacy.

733
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:37,336
[Wednesday] Until
he lost his mind?

734
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:40,714
[Judi] He wanted to be a DaVinci,
but his body couldn't take it.

735
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:45,219
Well, if you can't bring Icarus to
the sun, bring the sun to Icarus.

736
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:46,595
Right, Fester?

[dramatic music builds]

738
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:58,858
What the hell happened?

739
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:00,192
Wednesday happened.

740
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:02,194
We need to call in
Sheriff Santiago.

Oh!

745
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:18,169
Get off of me! Stop it! Get off!

746
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:22,172
As much as I wanna watch them pluck
her feathers, we gotta vamoose.

747
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:25,384
Get off of me!

748
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:27,136
You go.

749
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:28,846
I owe you one, Uncle Fester.

750
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:30,639
[Fester] Are you kidding me?

751
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,018
We just liberated
our first asylum!

752
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:36,144
I live for days like this.

753
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:42,693
-I'm going to get you out of here.
-What kind of angel are you?

754
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:44,236
An avenging one.

[breathing heavily]

761
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:36,496
I told you Mama would
get you out of here.

762
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:47,674
I could never abandon you.

763
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:53,430
Wish I could say the same.

764
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:57,976
You're the reason I've
been locked away in here.

765
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:02,147
You're not my mother.

766
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:04,817
You're my master.

767
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,777
Or should I say...

768
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:09,738
you were.

769
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:13,533
Wednesday Addams! We both know
that she's the real enemy.

770
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:17,204
She's here, in the
building, right now.

771

Destiny has given us a second
chance to take her out.

772

I'll take care of Wednesday.

773

Right after I take care of you.

774
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:30,092
I'm the only one
who's ever loved you.

775

I unlocked your true potential.

776

You did.

777
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:38,016

a five-second head start.
