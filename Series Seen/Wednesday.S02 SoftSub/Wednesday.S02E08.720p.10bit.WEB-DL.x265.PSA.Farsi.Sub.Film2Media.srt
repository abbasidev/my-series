1
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:18,852
<i>William Faulkner said,
"The past is never dead."</i>

2
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,813
<i>"It's not even the past."</i>

3
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:25,025
<i>In fact, it's all
still happening.</i>

4
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:28,778
<i>If Isaac's goal is
to save his sister,</i>

5
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:32,199
<i>why kidnap Pugsley?</i>

6
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:33,909
All right. Spread out, guys.

7
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:35,744
-You, that way.
-Pugsley!

8
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,788
<i>What does a
brain-eating genius need</i>

9
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,956
<i>with my half-wit brother?</i>

10
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,169
No sign of your son.

11
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:47,005
Any idea why someone
would kidnap him?

12
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:48,799
It's a total mystery, Sheriff.

13
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,760
Can you think of anyone who has
a grudge against your family?

14
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,470
Could this be some
kind of revenge?

15
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:56,139
Are you blaming us for
our son's kidnapping?

16
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,934
The search parties will
run through the night.

17
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:02,062
Parents who were at the gala have
already left with their kids.

18
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,605
All other students
will be packed up

19
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:06,107
and on their way home
by tomorrow afternoon.

20
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,819
I'm sorry. We're doing
everything we can.

21
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:13,949
I sent your father and Lurch
out to join the search parties.

22
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,325
They won't find Pugsley.

23
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,618
Isaac's too smart.

24
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:20,622
{\an8}You need to work together, and to pool
your psychic abilities to locate him.

25
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:22,791
My mother is a Dove who's
blind to malevolence,

26
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:26,544
and my psychic ability is currently
on an unauthorized leave of absence.

27
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:31,341
That's why you must turn to
the <i>other</i> Raven in your family.

28
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:32,384
My mother?

29
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:35,262
These are desperate times.

30
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:47,733
Mama, I appreciate you coming
back on such short notice.

31
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,652
Why would anyone bother
kidnapping Pugsley?

32
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,863
Not to cast aspersions,

33
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,532
but I know higher value
corpses than that boy.

34
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,951
His kidnapper isn't
looking for ransom money.

35
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:01,913
He's being used as a pawn to keep
us away, or a ploy to draw us in.

36
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:06,626
So many delightful
memories of this room.

37
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:10,130
I can still hear the terrified
shrieks of my classmates

38
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,799
during Rotwood's Advanced
Possession Class.

39
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,052
Scaredy-cats.

40
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,396
This does require actual
physical connection.

41
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:37,199
Now we must clear our minds
of all past grievances.

42
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:40,452
My past grievances are like fine
wine. They get better with age.

43
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:41,619
Likewise.

44
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:47,751
<i>Doves and Ravens together ignite</i>

45
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:51,462
<i>With wings of darkness
and piercing eyes</i>

46
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,841
<i>Guide us to truth
through night and morn</i>

47
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:57,886
<i>To this let our powers be sworn</i>

48
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,055
I didn't drive all this way
to hold hands in the dark.

49
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,182
How long do we have
to keep this up?

50
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:05,310
Mama! For once just be quiet.
We're trying to find Pugsley.

51
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,021
I feel something.

52
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:10,524
-I feel it too.
-Do you sense it, Wednesday?

53
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,118
Hurry, Gomez!

54
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,623
No one will ever
know we were here.

55
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,740
I saw you and Father burying
Isaac under the Skull Tree

56
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,825
back when you were students.

57
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,830
If there was ever a time to unburden
yourself of the truth, now is it.

58
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:55,712
You've wasted enough of my time.

59
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,171
The night of Isaac's accident,

60
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,590
your father and I

61
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,051
were at his laboratory

62
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,846
in Iago Tower.

63
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:12,187
<i>Isaac was certain his machine
would permanently cure Francoise.</i>

64
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,481
<i>That she would never again live
in fear of turning into a Hyde.</i>

65
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:21,279
<i>But the machine required a great
amount of energy to power it.</i>

66
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,323
And for that,

67
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,950
Isaac turned to his best friend.

68
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:27,534
Father.

69
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:34,000
What could Gomez have
possibly contributed?

70
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:39,213
<i>Back then, Gomez was just
as electrifying as Pugsley.</i>

71
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:43,802
<i>And Gomez was more than
happy to help his friend.</i>

72
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:46,304
But Isaac tricked him.

73
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:50,058
<i>He needed more than a spark.</i>

74
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,230
<i>Unbeknownst to Francoise,</i>

75
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:59,400
<i>Isaac was willing to sacrifice
your father's life to save hers.</i>

76
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,320
He even dug your father's grave

77
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,698
under the Skull
Tree in preparation.

78
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,169
<i>By the time I arrived,</i>

79
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:21,214
my darling Gomez
was close to death.

80
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:26,594
My sabotage sent the
machine into a frenzy.

81
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,440
Francoise, she
survived the explosion,

82
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,607
but Isaac didn't.

83
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,152
<i>And as for your father,</i>

84
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:46,614
<i>the experience permanently robbed
him of his Outcast ability.</i>

85
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,450
Hmm.

86
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,578
Why cover it up?

87
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,747
Because Augustus
Stonehurst threatened us.

88
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,915
We knew he built Isaac
the lab in secret.

89
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,793
If we breathed a word, he
would've turned us in for murder.

90
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:00,169
Hurry, Gomez.

91
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,423
No one will ever
know we were here.

92
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:07,343
So you buried Isaac in the same
grave he intended for Father?

93
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:12,932
Yes.

94
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,018
Isaac must be trying again.

95
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,312
This time using Pugsley
as the power source.

96
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:20,189
That Addams headstone, the
one I saw in my premonition,

97
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,816
must have Pugsley's name on it.

98
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:29,032
I think it's best that you and Thing go
with Grandmama until Pugsley is found.

99
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,910
For once, your mother
and I are in agreement.

100
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,579
These are our sins, Wednesday.

101
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,038
We will face them.

102
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,334
I won't put you in danger again.

103
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,501
Too late.

104
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:00,605
I'm sorry.

105
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,524
You deserve better than that.

106
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,405
I didn't realize we were
back on speaking terms.

107
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,072
It took me a minute.

108
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,235
But I'm ready to be friends.

109
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:16,120
If that's cool with you.

110
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,999
I'd like that very much.

111
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,461
Why the change of heart?

112
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,299
I realized that our
breakup wasn't about me.

113
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,540
You know, it's nobody's fault
that your feelings changed.

114
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:36,057
So I can either be angry about it,
or I can just accept it and move on.

115
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,310
Actually, Bianca told me that.

116
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,313
She can be very persuasive.

117
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:04,544
Please tell me that you're done
with lying wolves and beta-gorgons.

118
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,671
I put together a list
of potential boyfriends.

119
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:10,216
I already cross-referenced them based
on compatible social media profiles.

120
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,926
Once you've narrowed it down,

121
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,596
I can pay each one
an invisible visit.

122
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,931
See what they've left
out of their bios.

123
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,099
Hmm.

124
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,976
I appreciate the assist,

125
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:24,022
but I think I'm gonna rip a page
out of the Wednesday Addams playbook

126
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,648
and take a break from romance.

127
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,696
It's not very fun

128
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:34,824
to be tied up and
treated like a pet...

129
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,285
is it?

130
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,412
"Mystery meat sandwich!"

131
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,122
"Your favorite."

132
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,083
Conserve your energy.

133
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,418
You're gonna need it.

134
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,965
I wish I was at least in
one of these pictures.

135
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:57,263
I never understood your
desire for a Normie life.

136
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:03,269
But... knowing what Stonehurst
did to you in that lab...

137
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,941
Neither of us got the
end that we deserved.

138
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,403
That changes tonight.

139
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:17,742
Promise me,

140
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,661
no matter what happens,

141
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:20,911
you'll do it.

142
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:22,913
What we discussed.

143
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:26,375
I need your word.

144
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:35,593
I made Hyde tracks about 20 miles
north and dropped Pugsley's costume,

145
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,928
then made an anonymous
tip like you said.

146
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,265
Good, huh?

147
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,809
That'll keep the
cops off our trail.

148
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:47,772
Now, it's time to position
your old flame onto the board.

149
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,691
Wednesday will know
she's being played.

150
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:53,486
Yeah, an Addams... would never
sacrifice one of their own.

151
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,154
Not even a pawn.

152
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,532
And that emotional weakness

153
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:01,035
will be our checkmate.

154
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:03,830
Any Pugsley update?

155
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,124
Still missing. But he's alive.

156
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,293
Isaac is hellbent on
saving his sister.

157
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:11,546
I know he needs Pugsley. Just
need to figure out when and where.

158
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,673
Crap. He's here.

159
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:14,757
Who?

160
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:16,633
Isaac?

161
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,720
No. My dad.

162
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,806
He usually sends some ran
do assistant to collect me.

163
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,641
Your mom couldn't come get you?

164
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:26,852
She's busy with her new
Normie husband and baby.

165
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,897
I was the mistake that kept
her and my dad together

166
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,441
long past their sell-by date.

167
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,359
Gunpowder, penicillin, the rack.

168
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,528
Those were all mistakes.

169
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:39,907
I just want to say
that I love us.

170
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,367
We're like the three musketeers.

171
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,368
Careful.

172
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:43,536
Agnes!

173
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:46,038
Bye. See you next year.

174
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:49,834
I wish I could help, but I
have to get to the Lupin cages.

175
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,502
Capri read me the riot act.

176
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,338
Lock in early and stay calm.

177
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:56,132
So I have my meditation
app, my fave playlist,

178
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,384
and an extra supply
of colloidal silver.

179
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,595
What could go wrong, right?

180
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,588
I'll be there first thing in
the morning to let you out.

181
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,017
Promise?

182
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,274
You. We're waking
the dead again.

183
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:15,276
How long until your
corpse moths are airborne?

184
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,612
Unfortunately, they're
permanently grounded.

185
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,448
Corpse moths only have
a 36-hour life cycle.

186
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,410
Wednesday, I'm really sorry.

187
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,454
Pugsley wanted to be my
friend and I blew him off.

188
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,998
Maybe if I'd been nicer, he
wouldn't have felt the need

189
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,750
to become BFFs with a zombie.

190
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,502
I am my brother's keeper.

191
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,712
I simply should have caged
him for his own protection.

192
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:38,049
I'm heading to the Hummer shed.
Have to hibernate my bees early.

193
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,467
Wanna come...

194
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,991
Wednesday, I'm on my
way to see your parents.

195
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,702
A hiker found Pugsley's costume.

196
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,496
I'm redeploying the search
from Jericho to Burlington.

197
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,456
Sounds like a ploy to
draw you off the scent.

198
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,459
I follow evidence, not hunches.

199
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:17,213
Finally, I get my office back.

200
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:22,343
Dort's crashing downfall
has validated my legacy.

201
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:26,347
The board will now look back
upon the Weems era with fondness.

202
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:30,143
Nevermore clearly needs a
steady hand on the rudder.

203
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:33,104
A leader of impeccable
moral character.

204
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,648
You covered up Rowan's murder
and the existence of a Hyde.

205
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,526
Mistakes were made.

206
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,070
But that's all in the past.

207
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,243
I went out to the Hummers shed.

208
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,787
Slurp was there, except
he looks totally human.

209
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,955
He told me to give you this.

210
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:54,417
Said if I breathe a word to
anyone else, he'd come for me.

211
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,335
Wednesday, I'm scared.

212
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,546
Go back to your
dorm. Lock the door.

213
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,130
Now!

214
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,906
Isaac thinks he can lure
me out to finish me off.

215
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,580
When you get a clear shot...

216
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,750
put a bolt in his zombie brain.

217
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,557
Tyler warned me you
were formidable.

218
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,394
And now I've witnessed
the havoc you can wreak.

219
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:58,939
Give me my brother, crawl back into
your hole, and stay dead this time.

220
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,276
-I know what you did to my father.
-Yet I'm the one who died.

221
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,237
Thanks to him and
your dear mother.

222
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:09,617
Why don't you let your brother
pay for their mistakes,

223
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,701
and we'll call it even?

224
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,328
You don't have the machine.

225
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,539
Willow Hill and Iago
Tower have been destroyed.

226
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,457
It would take months to rebuild.

227
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,209
By the time you did, it'd be
too late to save your sister.

228
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,008
I... I applaud the effort.

229
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,301
You keep me talking

230
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,970
while your faithful right
hand takes his shot.

231
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,309
Gotcha.

232
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:43,192
Except he's never been yours.

233
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,318
He's mine.

234
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,740
Turns out your parents didn't
kill all of me that night.

235
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:08,885
Cute.

236
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,220
Imagine my surprise
when I saw my right hand

237
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,973
wandering the halls of
Willow Hill without me.

238
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:18,060
And a DaVinci... is nothing
without his right hand.

239
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,566
<i>Your mother cut it off.</i>

240
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:33,826
<i>Causing my machine to go
out of control and explode.</i>

241
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:38,039
The power surge must have
somehow animated my hand.

242
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,374
In your case, the part is
greater than the whole.

243
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,412
Now I am complete.

244
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:27,129
The Addams family

245
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,257
ends tonight.

246
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,136
Starting with you.

247
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,875
We have an appointment
at Iago Tower.

248
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:08,629
Your pathetic little life
will finally have a purpose.

249
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:41,745
Now we can finally
fix our family.

250
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,288
Hello!

251
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:47,459
Come on.

252
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:53,132
{\an8}<i>Take a deep breath
in, and slowly exhale.</i>

253
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,342
{\an8}<i>Now visualize the wolf within.</i>

254
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:57,845
{\an8}<i>A powerful but gentle spirit.</i>

255
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,639
<i>Be mindful that tonight
belongs to tranquility...</i>

256
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:01,974
Enid! I need you.

257
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:05,644
-Agnes? I thought you left.
-I couldn't abandon Wednesday.

258
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:07,980
So I ditched my dad
when he stopped for gas.

259
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,816
Isaac buried Wednesday
under the Skull Tree.

260
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:11,984
And I can't dig her out.

261
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,570
What? Oh my God.

262
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,530
-Where's Thing?
-Longer story.

263
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:19,700
I'll fill you in on the way.
We haven't got much time!

264
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:24,163
Wednesday, we're
here! Hang on!

265
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,002
I hear a heartbeat,
but it's weak.

266
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,970
We aren't gonna
get to her in time.

267
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,681
No, no, no.

268
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,565
I'm not strong
enough like this.

269
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,944
You won't be able to turn back.

270
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:57,779
You're an Alpha.

271
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,865
I can't let her die.

272
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:28,143
Wednesday, wake up. Wake up!

273
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,401
Please. Please.

274
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,030
I enjoyed that.

275
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,453
Enid?

276
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:51,959
It was the only way to save you.

277
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,597
Go track her. Now!

278
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,101
Wednesday! Wednesday!

279
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,437
Thank the spirits.

280
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,692
Or just one in particular.

281
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,404
If you don't hurry, you'll
have nothing left to save.

282
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:21,947
Where's Pugsley?

283
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:37,087
It's all still here.

284
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,591
Good.

285
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:43,052
How are we gonna put
this junk back together?

286
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,303
We're not.

287
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:47,514
I am.

288
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:25,344
Even if you never told
me the truth about Thing,

289
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:26,845
why didn't you tell him?

290
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:29,431
Because sometimes the truth
is better left buried.

291
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,224
Thing had no memory of Isaac.

292
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:36,146
<i>After everything Isaac did to your father,
why burden Thing with that knowledge?</i>

293
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:40,734
I like to think whatever trace of goodness
was in Isaac somehow ended up in Thing.

294
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:44,029
Except now he's reattached to Isaac,
and he's about to kill your son.

295
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,951
Mad scientist,
cliché soundtrack.

296
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:49,952
Perfect.

297
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,035
Darling,

298
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,497
you call the sheriff.

299
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,374
Leave this to us.

300
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,460
<i>Querida,</i> save our boy.

301
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:34,705
Isaac, are you all right?

302
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:36,707
I'm fine.

303
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,500
Secure the power source.

304
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:57,186
I've been waiting for
this moment for 30 years.

305
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,122
Get ready.

306
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:19,249
We're about to fry your battery.

307
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:32,304
It's time, Isaac.

308
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:34,221
Do it now.

309
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:37,642
Now!

310
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:39,728
You promised me.

311
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,581
Wait! What are you doing?

312
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,376
Mom, we're here to save you.

313
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,461
It's too late for me, sweetie.

314
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,755
This is your time now.

315
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:09,132
We can save you from this life.

316
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,135
Give you a fresh start.

317
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:16,014
No, no, you have no right
to take my power from me!

318
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:20,644
Love you.

319
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,605
Don't do this. Please.

320
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:24,981
I love you, baby.

321
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:35,950
Mom!

322
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:39,913
You take the main staircase.
I'll take the ladder.

323
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,294
Mom, please!

324
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:50,674
Mom!

325
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,428
We have company.

326
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,806
Please, don't do this!

327
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:41,474
Kill me.

328
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,987
-Why?
-I missed.

329
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,503
Tyler, no!

330
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:12,213
No!

331
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:18,345
Isaac!

332
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:20,847
Isaac!

333
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:22,807
Isaac.

334
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:29,147
It's okay.

335
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,024
-Wednesday?
-Shh.

336
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,401
It's your mommy.

337
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:36,363
I haven't enjoyed a mother-son
relationship like this since <i>Psycho.</i>

338
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:44,329
Tyler? Honey?

339
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:47,833
Baby...

340
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,409
Hold on, Pugsley. Hold on.

341
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:38,359
Isaac!

342
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,780
You have something
that belongs to me.

343
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:46,826
Come on! Come on!

344
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:20,777
Go.

345
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,404
Go, go, go!

346
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:03,444
Mom. Dad.

347
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:07,740
Tish!

348
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:18,209
Help me. Help me with this.

349
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:35,393
I guess your premonition
didn't come true after all.

350
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:48,698
Because of you,

351
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:51,618
I lost the only person
I ever truly loved.

352
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:54,162
Isaac! Isaac!

353
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:55,831
It's over.

354
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,249
Let my daughter go.

355
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,917
Sorry, old friend.

356
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,503
Now you two will know
what real pain feels like.

357
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:06,799
One more step, and
I snap her neck!

358
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,683
Thing, we know you're
still in there.

359
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,893
Come back to us,
Thing. We love you.

360
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:18,979
We're your family!

361
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:21,272
This was never part
of your family.

362
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:23,232
It's a part of me!

363
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,540
You missed!

364
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:50,093
Come on, Thing.

365
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:01,771
What is happening?

366
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,651
-Ah!
-Doesn't take a genius to figure that out.

367
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,197
Time's up.

368
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:05,812
Welcome back, Thing.

369
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:38,344
Knowing you were cut from the
literal cloth of an evil genius,

370
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,805
it makes sense why
we're so compatible.

371
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:44,684
How does it feel finally
knowing the truth?

372
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:51,274
That you can't control the past.
But the future is in your own hand.

373
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,195
What's it going to be?

374
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:11,294
-What have you been able to figure out?
-This was on a wildlife cam this morning.

375
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:14,630
That's Enid.

376
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:16,633
She was heading north,

377
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,843
just five miles from
the Canadian border.

378
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:20,095
What about Capri?

379
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:23,264
Was she able to provide intel that
could tell us where Enid is going?

380
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,682
She's MIA.

381
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:27,018
Probably on the hunt
for her next job,

382
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:30,146
now that Nevermore is nevermore.

383
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:40,239
Hello, Tyler.

384
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:44,660
Whoever you are, just walk away.

385
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:50,166
We both know you can't
survive out here alone.

386
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,335
Not for long.

387
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:55,130
But I can save you.

388
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,510
Yeah, I'm done with
mothers and masters.

389
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:03,095
I'm not interested
in being either.

390
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:07,475
I'm offering...

391
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:11,604
a support system for
people just like you.

392
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:13,356
Fellow Hydes,

393
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:16,275
hidden away where the
world can't find them.

394
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:20,696
You'd be part of a pack,

395
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:26,327
creating a bond that transcends
the need for a single master.

396
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:33,751
What's in it for you?

397
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:36,879
You're a werewolf. I
can smell it from here.

398
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:39,924
My father was a Hyde.

399
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,103
This isn't gonna explode
in my face, is it?

400
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:53,688
A little snack for the road.

401
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:58,651
Don't forget to pace yourself.

402
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:00,987
Whoa. Thanks.

403
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:03,364
You know, I was thinking,

404
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:05,992
over the break, if
you're not too busy,

405
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,660
you could come for a visit?

406
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,871
Really? To your actual house?

407
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,332
That's what friends do, right?

408
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,171
Hmm.

409
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:21,257
Wednesday.

410
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:24,010
Wait.

411
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:27,888
I would like you
to have something.

412
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:31,517
Aunt Ophelia's journal.

413
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,685
Yes.

414
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,063
As I keep being reminded,

415
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:38,274
harboring secrets can
have deadly consequences.

416
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:41,861
Every family has dark
chapters, Wednesday.

417
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:45,448
Including ours.

418
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:47,658
Thank you, Mother.

419
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,746
It's gratifying to
see you two together.

420
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:56,125
Restoring your familial bond

421
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:59,378
was the first big step in
regaining your psychic ability.

422
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:05,259
Now that it's happened, I'm
taking a well-deserved sabbatical.

423
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:16,479
Whoever thought that the person to
keep my spirit alive would be you?

424
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,941
Until we meet again, Wednesday.

425
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,497
Whoa, it's sunny out there.

426
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:38,709
It will be a relief sleeping
under our own leaky roof tonight.

427
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:42,213
Oh, let's get your
things. <i>Vamos.</i>

428
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:43,464
I won't be going home.

429
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:58,730
I got your message.

430
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,732
I'm always up for a road trip.

431
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:03,443
So where to? Slaughter
Beach? Death Valley?

432
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:05,653
We're headed north
to rescue Enid.

433
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:07,530
She's an Alpha.

434
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:11,159
Ooh, I hear those puppies got fangs
that can rip you apart like taffy,

435
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,911
and claws that can slice
you up like lunch meat.

436
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:14,912
What fun!

437
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:16,372
Go.

438
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:27,049
<i>Another year at Nevermore
ends in carnage and chaos.</i>

439
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:30,595
<i>Unanswered questions
hover like vultures.</i>

440
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:39,270
<i>Why did I slice Tyler's bonds
rather than his jugular?</i>

441
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:41,939
<i>And will that impulsive act
of mercy become my undoing?</i>

442
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:48,112
<i>As for my parents, their
smiles don't erase their lies.</i>

443
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:55,161
<i>Was my mother's gift of
Ophelia's diary an act of trust,</i>

444
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,872
<i>or silent desperation?</i>

445
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:04,044
<i>First I must find Enid.</i>

446
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:08,424
<i>I gave her my word.</i>

447
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:11,510
<i>But who exactly will
return by my side?</i>

448
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:14,680
<i>My friend?</i>

449
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:17,308
<i>Or the beast that's
consumed her?</i>

450
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:33,199
Aunt Ophelia.

451
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:46,378
<i>Secrets are the bedrock
of the Addams family.</i>

452
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:50,883
<i>Toxic and festering
just below the surface.</i>

453
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,270
Ophelia!

454
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:11,279
<i>As I venture into the unknown,</i>

455
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:14,573
<i>I am determined to exhume
every lie and deception,</i>

456
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:16,450
<i>or die trying.</i>

457
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:20,288
<i>Sounds like a perfect
vacation to me.</i>
