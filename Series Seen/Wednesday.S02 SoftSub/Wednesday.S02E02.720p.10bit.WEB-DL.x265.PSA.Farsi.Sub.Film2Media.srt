It's you I'm worried about.

Mother.

12
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,581
When it comes to your ability, I
asked you to be honest with me.

13
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:41,791
I know what those tears mean.

14
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,169
It's psychic exhaustion.

15
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:47,214
That's what happens when
you abuse your gift.

16
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,507
I've harnessed it.

17
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,967
[scoffs] You sound
just like your aunt.

18
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,928
How do I get the
tears to go away?

19
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:58,224
Well... you can start by giving
me Goody's book of spells.

20
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,644
Don't be upset with him.
He was worried sick.

21
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,355
As was I.

22
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:09,402
Goody was my spirit guide.
That book belongs to me.

23
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:11,989
This isn't something
you can control.

24
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,908
You have to be patient and
wait for your new guide.

25
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:16,827
They will appear when
the time is right.

26
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,453
I don't have that time.

27
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:20,747
Not after tonight.

28
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,418
You never believe the
rules apply to you.

29

And I applaud that.

30
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:29,339
But you cannot bend your
psychic ability to your will.

31
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,299
And you can't expect
me to bend to yours.

32
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:35,721
You cannot tell me to blaze my own
trail and then put up these roadblocks.

33
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:37,222
I am not your enemy.

34
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:38,305
I am your mother.

35
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:41,393
Your ability is not a
weapon to be deployed.

36
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,520
It's a gift to be respected.

37
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,356
I liked you better

You were supposed to
help me protect her.

Are you asking as my
lawyer or as my father?

111
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:22,442
I can recognize when a fellow card player
is keeping some aces up their sleeve.

He was working on a

You get your reckless
curiosity from me.

That's why your mother's
so worried about you.

118
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,876
You need to pack her trunks
and take her back home.

I'm afraid her mind is made up.

Don't worry, I didn't tell Ajax.

What were you doing
in the Hummers Shed?

told us the first night here?

00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,256
It's all true.

00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:13,427
I jump-started his clockwork heart
and brought him back to life.

This really is the boy
from the Skull Tree.

He's not an urban legend.

00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,309
He was one of us.

147
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,353
Which is why we should keep
him locked up in here forever.

148
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,690
I don't think that's
a very safe idea.

149
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,359
Or a sanitary one.

150
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:30,445
We need to tell someone
before he eats us.

151
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,362
He won't.

152
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:33,865
Besides, he's got no brain.

153
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,742
Which means he's as
harmless as a slug.

In my last vision, Enid
dies and it's all my fault.

Somehow it's connected
to those birds.

Why do you want to see Tyler?

471
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:29,565
To parrot my former
psychiatrist,

472
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,234
who Tyler gutted like
a freshly caught trout,

473
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,610
I need closure.

474
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:37,030
I granted your request
with the court weeks ago,

475
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:39,658
so I knew you'd show your
face sooner or later.

476
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:43,995
I'm guessing you chose today
because of Donovan Galpin's murder.

477
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:46,873
Has Tyler heard the news?

478
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:52,170
Tyler has proven to be a particularly
manipulative and uncooperative patient.

479
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,590
Of course, I've never
dealt with a Hyde before,

480
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,675
so this is uncharted territory.

481
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,302
What about Marilyn Thornhill?

482
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:01,096
She still denies that
she's Tyler's master.

483
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,807
She's being held in
a different facility.

484
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,893
I'm working off the theory that
the longer they're separated,

485
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:08,854
the weaker their bond becomes.

486
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:12,607
Then I surmise you and I are
speaking because you need my help.

487
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,861
My traditional care methods
aren't yielding results,

488
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,821
so I think it's time to be...

489
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:19,615

490
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,282
Well, you know what they say.

If you can't kill them with
kindness, try lethal injection.

492
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,247
This way.

493
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:42,220
You could be the psychological
shock Tyler needs

494
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:44,389
to initiate his rehabilitation.

495
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:48,768
If the sight of me brings him
any modicum of pain, count me in.

[keypad beeping]

497
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,824
Now, you'll be perfectly safe,

498
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:06,119
but if you feel threatened
or uncomfortable in any way,

499
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:07,788
push the red button on the wall.

I'll be watching
everything on the monitor.

Keep a close watch, please.

502
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:50,288
So, what do you
think of the place?

503
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:58,714
It was originally designed
for a schizophrenic werewolf,

504
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:02,801
who went on a full-moon killing
spree in the summer of '92.

505
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:05,303
Ironic, considering you
were thrashed by a werewolf.

506
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:10,558
It was inevitable your morbid
curiosity would bring you here.

507
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:13,770
I knew you couldn't
resist seeing me again.

508
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:17,023
Is that the deluded lie you've
been telling yourself in solitude?

509
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:20,026
The only person lying to
themselves is you, Wednesday.

510
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,779
You sensed the monster in me.

511
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:25,073
You fell in love with it.

512
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:30,662
We're two black-hearted souls ready
to pillage the world together.

513
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:33,373
The only thing you're pillaging
is an extra fruit cup at dinner.

514
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:36,960
You act like you're the smartest
person in the room, but you're not.

515
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:40,714
How come I ended up on
this side of the bars?

516
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:41,923

[Wednesday] Gruesomely.

523
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,575
Another victim
died the same way.

524
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:11,202
Your father's old
partner. Carl Bradbury.

525
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,788
Two murders in two days.

526
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:16,875
Both connected to your family.

527
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,336
You got me, Wednesday.

528
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,257
I'm a criminal mastermind
pulling the strings from in here.

529
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,884
Who else would want him dead?

530
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,220
You're looking for my help?

531
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:33,433
I'm flattered, but... it's
going to be so much more fun

532
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:35,768
watching you grope
around in the dark.

533
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:40,565
Say hi to Enid for me.

534
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:45,153
Tell her I'm gonna kill her
the next time I see her.

535
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:49,032
Make her pay for sticking
her snout in my business.

536
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:53,369
I want her screams to haunt
you for the rest of your life.

537
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:56,247
[Wednesday] You're right.

538
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,752
I couldn't resist seeing you.

539
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:05,340
Witnessing you chained and caged
up makes my dark heart grin.

540
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,343
Thornhill chose you to be
her murderous marionette,

541
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,887
not just because she saw some
Hyde hibernating inside you,

542
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,722
but because she
saw the real you.

543
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,308
An expendable nobody.

544
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:17,686
A feeble-minded schoolyard bully

545
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:21,314
with nothing to offer to the world
except for subpar barista skills.

546
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:26,110
Your fleeting moment of notoriety will
fade quicker than your generic looks.

547
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:30,490
Thinking of you rotting away in this
cell in anonymous mediocrity, that...

548
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,326
is the best revenge.

549
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:35,453
[feral growling]

550
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,931
-[Tyler screams]
-[electricity sparks]

551
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:41,918
I don't need to visit again.

552
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,211
[Tyler panting]

553
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,964
I already take up enough
space in your twisted head.

554
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,804
[bellows]

555
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,645
[Tyler's bellow echoing]

556
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:15,576
[Orloff] The human brain is the
hungriest organ in the body,

557
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,746
consuming 20%...

558
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:21,749
Who did that?

559
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:23,792
Go on!

560
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,170
Speak up!

561
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,132
[yelps]

562
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:30,634
[class snickering]

563
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:33,344
Listen up, people.

564
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:36,848
-[Eugene] Psst.
-Unless the perpetrator reveals...

565
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,683
We've got a problem. Come on.

566
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:42,186
[Orloff] ...you'll be spending the
rest of the semester in detention.

567
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,647
I'm watching you two.

568
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,567
[frantic, suspenseful
music playing]

569
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:48,818
[Pugsley] What?

570
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:51,112
Your pet zombie, Slurp,

571
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:52,780
he's escaped.

572
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,913
[Bruno] So you didn't
have your driving lesson?

573
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,622
[Enid] Nope. He was a no-show.

574
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:15,887
So, want to study for
Orloff's anatomy test?

575
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,556
-He may be a head in a jar, but...
-Yeah.

576
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,184
[indistinct chatter]

577
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:22,769
[Enid chuckles]

578
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:28,274
[Enid] How'd that get in here?

579
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,029
It's for Thing.

580
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,200
Thing?

581
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:38,910
[ragged breathing]

582
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,286
[Enid] Anyone home?

583
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:44,207
Thing? Have you been drinking?

584
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:47,585
How is that even... You know
what? It doesn't matter.

585
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:49,420
Could you just give us a second?

586
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,339
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

587
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,300
[whispers] Thing.
You've got a package.

588
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:58,262
I don't know if maybe it's for Prank Day,
or maybe it's from Wednesday's stalker.

589
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,891
[quirky, eccentric
music playing]

590
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:07,313
It's your mugshot from the Normal,
Illinois police department.

591
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:09,399
There's a town called Normal?

592
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:11,526
Who's Fernando Fingertips?

593
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,444
Your first alias?

594
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,655
Yeah, it is very catchy.

595
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:22,454
"Found this while cleaning
out an old safe house."

596
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:25,040
"Happy birthday to my
buddy from another body."

597
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:28,501
"Snickers and wet willies,
your partner in crime, Fester."

598
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,629
Thing! Is it your birthday?

599
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:34,174
No, Wednesday didn't tell me!

600
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:37,552
Did the entire Addams family
forget it was your birthday?

601
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,972
I'm really sorry. You know what?

602
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:43,516
You are an honorary
member of the Wolf Pack.

603
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:46,144
Why don't we take you
out tonight to celebrate?

604
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:47,729
[thud]

605
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,564
Bruno! Oh my God, oh my God!

606
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,649
-What happened? Are you...
-[thud, clattering]

607
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,250
[knocking at door]

608
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,333
Yes?

609
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,467
Do you have an update
on Mrs. Addams?

610
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,427
I gave her the donor list.

611
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,054
She's going through the names,

612
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:24,098
and we'll meet at the end of
the week to discuss strategy.

613
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:27,393
And you drew her attention
to <i>numero uno</i> on that list?

614
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:31,355
Unfortunately, she and
her mother are estranged.

615
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:33,983
How estranged?

616
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,235
She refuses to call her.

617
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:42,117
Hester Frump is the linchpin
to this whole campaign.

618
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,035
She is the 50-foot shark

619
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:48,331
that will signal the other big fish
that Nevermore is worth preserving.

620
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,792
Why don't you have that
conversation with Mrs. Addams?

621
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:55,087
Because you can be so
much more persuasive.

622
00:36:57,715 --> 00:37:00,426
You're not seriously asking
me to siren song her?

623
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:01,844
Of course not.

624
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:03,554
I'm ordering you.

625
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:11,437
You will never try
and coerce me again.

626
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,442
[Bianca sighs in relief]

627
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:18,569
Nice try, Ms. Barclay.

628
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,197
Yeah.

629
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:22,949
[clicks tongue]

630
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:27,078
Little souvenir I picked up in a dinky
antique shop in the Florida Keys.

631
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,537
It's beautiful, isn't it?

632
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:33,168
Oh, and this here is made up of
itty-bitty pieces of Corinthian coral,

633
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,837
making me impervious
to your siren song.

634
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,713
I keep it on me at all times.

635
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:39,924
[Dort clears throat]

636
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:42,343
You see, the key to winning

637
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:44,762
in both golf and life

638
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,598
is keeping your eye on the ball.

639
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,558
So let me help you focus.

640
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:51,269
We both know that I hold
your future in my hand.

641
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:54,897
I could either lift
you up... or crush you.

642
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:56,691
Understood?

643
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:02,614
Now use your gift

644
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:06,659
and get Morticia Addams and
her beloved mother on our side.

play, you were hardly complimentary.

Let's go.

00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,784
[Enid] If only there was a full
moon, we'd be out of here in no time.

701
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,662
I'm really sorry, Bruno.

702
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:22,081
This isn't your fault.

703
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:24,542
[sighs] I mean, it kind of is.

704
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:27,628
Whatever's going on here is
clearly connected to my roommate.

705
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:30,422
She's like this dark north
star for psycho killers.

706
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,050
Why are you friends with her?

707
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,387
Because even though Wednesday

708
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,890
is literally the tunnel
at the end of my light...

[delicate, emotional

710
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:43,269
...I can't imagine my
life without her in it.

711
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:47,982
I think it's cool how
you're her ride or die.

712
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:50,109
Emphasis on die at the moment.

713

[Bruno chuckles softly]

714
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:54,196
I wish I had someone like that.

715
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:03,622
We have to find a way
to get out of here.

716
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,250
We can't break these chains,

717
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:09,169
but maybe we could wriggle out
if we find the right angle.

[Enid muttering indistinctly]

719

-Your shoulder.
-Get your feet around.

720
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:22,975
I thought you put new
batteries in this thing.

Are you okay?

732
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:35,464
I'm fine.

733
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:38,467
This happens sometimes when
I'm stressed or nervous.

734
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,302
It's just wolf whimpers.

735

Lupin late bloomers
usually suffer from it.

736

I was the last in my
family to wolf out.

You need to get us out of this!

work of a famous author.

[Wednesday] Proust, Tolstoy...

766
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:56,355
The answer must be a
book that's missing.

767

[Enid] I swear if I survive
this, I'm demanding a spa day!

-131.
-[Enid] Dammit. That's all of them.

My crazed stalker is an
invisible 13-year-old?

been properly introduced.

your number one super fan.

790
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:31,116
You don't seriously expect me to believe
you pulled off this elaborate prank solo.

791
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,953
I had a little help
from some DaVincis.

792
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:37,248
After I blackmailed them with
incriminating Snapchat pics.

793

Perks of being invisible.

794
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:43,712
I just asked myself, W-W-W...

796
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:47,424
What would Wednesday do?

797
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:49,593
That's my line,
you little psycho!

798
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:53,430
I knew if I came up with the most
twisted game, I'd get your attention.

799
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:57,267
I hope it's lived up to
your exacting standards.

800
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:00,437
Admit it, you're a
little impressed.

801
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:04,232
I can't believe we were almost
perforated by your fan girl mini-me.

802
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:07,528
Why don't I return the favor?

803
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:10,739
Park your claws, Rainbow Barbie.

804
00:49:10,822 --> 00:49:15,494
Besides, I got you some alone time
with the pack hottie. You're welcome.

805
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,873
You almost burned my novel
at the Founder's Pyre.

806
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:20,791
[Agnes] That was
just an appetizer.

807
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:23,085
This was the main course.

808
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:26,088
Then why kill Galpin and place
his eyeball on Enid's cushion?

809
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:28,132
That eyeball was real?

810
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:29,716
I didn't kill Galpin.

811
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,344
I wanted to become your friend.

812
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:34,763
Not your next murder case.

813
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:38,725
Took this as a... souvenir.

I already scrolled
through his texts.

815
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:45,399
And his e-mails.

816
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:47,609
So if you didn't kill
him, then who did?

817
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:49,611
I can help you find out.

818

819
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:59,579

have multiple stalkers.

Did you forget something, dear?

826
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:35,115
Actually, I did.

827
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:38,952
You must contact your mother,

828
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,371
invite her to the gala,

829
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:43,874
and secure a large donation.

830
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:47,169
She is your highest priority.

831
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:50,004
Yes.

832
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:51,840
That's it.

Mama.

834
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:56,094
I should call her.

835
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:03,560
You'll have no memory I
was here, Mrs. Addams.

836

I forgot your birthday.

And that's inexcusable.

840
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:38,720
I hope this makes up
for my memory lapse.

Unmasking my flame-haired stalker
was an unwelcome distraction.

If I'm able to regain my psychic ability,
I think I'll be able to save Enid

849

Galpin and Bradbury.
