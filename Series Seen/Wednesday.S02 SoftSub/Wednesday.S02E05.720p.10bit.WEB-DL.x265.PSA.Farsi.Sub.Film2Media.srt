I chose <i>Macbeth.</i>

Nothing like death,
despair, and dismemberment

11
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,003
to try and snap her
out of her coma.

This isn't Hell.

But I understand the confusion.

28
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:52,738
If I'm not dead, then
why are you here?

29
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,990
Because I am your
new spirit guide.

30
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,324
Surprise!

31
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:59,578
That's impossible. A spirit
guide must be a relative.

32
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,872
Turns out we're 13th cousins.

33
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,581
Twice removed.

34
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:06,042
There has to be another option.

35
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:09,796
Your last spirit guide literally
gave up her ghost to save you.

36
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,592
Believe me, nobody was putting up
their hand for this assignment.

37
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:14,718
Yet here you are.

38
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:18,055
The tantalizing prospect of
tormenting you from beyond the grave

39
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,307
was just too
delicious to pass up.

40
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,809
Now, you've certainly
been a busy bee.

41
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:25,687
Just a recap...

42
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,898
You lost your psychic ability.

43
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,274
Only after I mastered it.

44
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:33,737
You lied to your one and only friend,
Enid Sinclair, about her impending doom.

45
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,155
I was protecting her.

46
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,282
And the <i>coup de grâce,</i>

47
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:40,410
freeing Tyler Galpin,
a homicidal Hyde,

48
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:44,039

psychiatric institution.

49
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,833
Congratulations, Miss Addams.

50
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:50,962
Your hubris has yet again made you
the architect of your own demise.

51
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:53,465
I didn't think death could make
you any more condescending.

52
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:56,468
And your arrogance has only
made you more insufferable.

53
00:02:56,551 --> 00:03:00,013
Why don't you restore my ability,
so we can go our separate ways?

54
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,642
Your ability

55
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,394
is inextricably
tied to who you are.

56
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:07,938
You abused it.

57
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,481
You sound like my mother.

58
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,191
Sticks and stones.

60
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,569
I have no bones.

61
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:16,321
I'm done being lectured.

62
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:19,282
Then wake up!

Good afternoon. I'm Judi Stonehurst,
interim director of Willow Hill.

67
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:34,065
Two weeks ago, our facility suffered
a catastrophic power failure.

68
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:37,443
As a result, 46 of
our residents escaped.

69
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:40,322
Sadly, there were
several deaths,

70
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,825
including our beloved
director, Dr. Rachael Fairburn.

71
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:46,703
But, with the heroic help
of the sheriff's department,

72
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,372
we have apprehended
43 of those fugitives.

73
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:52,542
[voice quavering] They'll be
reassigned to other facilities,

74
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,460
since Willow Hill is

75
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,214
closed for the
foreseeable future.

76
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,381
Thank you.

-[reporters clamoring]
-[reporter] Sheriff Santiago!

78
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,804
The three fugitives
still at large

79
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:06,556
are Fester Addams,

80
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,600
a patient known as "John Doe,"

81
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,435
and Tyler Galpin.

82
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:14,606
I need to reiterate that they are
considered extremely dangerous.

83
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,316
If you see any of them,

84
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,777
contact the sheriff's
department immediately.

85
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,028
Yes.

86
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,155
Do you think they're
still in the area?

87
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:24,449
We believe Fester
Addams is long gone.

88
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,243
It's hard to say with John Doe.

89
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:30,288
We do know that Tyler suffered
multiple gunshot wounds.

90

Ms. Stonehurst, Wednesday
Addams just woke up.

93
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:42,508
I'm curious to hear about
her part in all of this.

94
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:46,972
As I told you, Sheriff, it was a
simple case of wrong place, wrong time.

95
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:50,016
She snuck in to pay her
uncle an unauthorized visit.

96
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,101
Sure she wasn't
trying to free him?

97
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,854
It's hardly credible that
an ordinary teenage girl

98
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:57,982
could be capable of circumventing
Willow Hill security.

99
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:01,152
"Ordinary" is the last word I'd
use to describe Wednesday Addams.

100
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:02,862
Hmm.

101
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:07,284
Well, if you'll excuse me, an interim
director's work is never done.

ain't gonna put up a fight.

about LOIS and I want to keep it that way.</i>

Now, I emptied out my
rainy day fund hiring you,

00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,619

Mmm.

00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,806
It's a sign of renewal
and fresh starts.

The sheriff will be getting an anonymous
tip to check out your secret lab.

117

I'm afraid all she'll find
are boxes of dusty files.

118
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:22,692
My secrets are dead and buried in
places no one will ever find them.

-Who's gloating?

You destroyed my
father's life's work.

121
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:31,868
I'm here to make sure that you
don't scorch the earth any further.

122
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,995
Scorched earth is
just a warm-up.

-He's getting closer.
-Please don't tell my mom.

Oh, man. I still can't
believe you guys are involved

in this whole
Morning Song scandal.

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,770
My mother was one of
its first members.

155
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:25,440
Gideon used her siren
song to recruit people.

156

She told me that
when it started,

157

they were actually
trying to help Outcasts.

158
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:31,779
It was a real community.

159
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,155
So what changed?

with good intentions.

Growing up, Gideon was my hero.

Of all the kids, I
was his favorite.

But then his mask slipped,

164
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:48,671
and I realized he was grooming
me to take over for my mom.

176
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:43,184
Your mom said you were staying
at the cottage to recuperate.

177
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:46,062
There's no time for that.
Tyler's still out there.

178
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:50,483
Sheriff Santiago said he's either dead
from the gunshot wounds or long gone.

179
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:51,734
He's alive.

180
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,152
He's in Jericho.

181
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,612
You saw him?

182
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:56,489
I need you to pack
up and go home.

183
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,491
Leave? Why?

184
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:01,994
He has plans to kill both
of us. I'm going to fix it.

185
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,664
Fix it? You're the
reason he escaped.

186
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,123
She's got a point.

187
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,835
I'm not scared of Tyler. I
already took him down once.

188
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:12,297
There's not a full moon for another
week. You got lucky last time.

189
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,508
What do you mean lucky? I still
have the scars from that fight.

190
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:16,968
Tyler had you pinned
against a tree

191
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:19,554
and was going to rip your throat
out until Galpin shot him.

192
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,097
I read the police statement.

193
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,100
Then I guess it was lucky I
showed up and saved your life.

194
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,060
Tyler was going to
gut you as well.

195
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:28,104
[Weems] She's got you there too.

196
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,982
-Tell her the truth about the premonition.
-Stay out of this.

197
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,942
Who are you talking to?

198
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,026
No one.

199
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,988
Okay, I'm going to blame this
conversation on your head trauma.

200
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,448
Enid, I'm trying to save you.

201
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,408
I don't need you to save me.

202
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:43,494
Is that why you stuck me on
lookout duty at Willow Hill?

203
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,746
Do you think I'm that helpless?

204
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,750
[scoffs softly] Your
silence is deafening.

205
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:53,170
-Where are you going?
-To be with my pack.

206
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,590
You might think you're
the only capable one here,

207
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,216
but you can't do
everything on your own.

208
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:00,219
That's not how the world works,
even for Wednesday Addams.

209
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,391
[Weems] Miss
Sinclair for the win.

210
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,686
Stay out of my room and my head.

211
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,944
[Wednesday] <i>Tyler declared
that Enid and I will die today.</i>

212
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:20,406
<i>He may be a deranged psychopath,
but his timing is poetic.</i>

213
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,367
<i>If I could choose my last day,</i>

214
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,578
El Día de los Muertos
<i>would top my wish list.</i>

215
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,248
<i>The Day of the Dead has always
been my favorite holiday.</i>

216
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,376
<i>Macabre decor,
graveyard gatherings,</i>

217
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,878
<i>and the chance to commune
with dead relatives.</i>

218
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,296
<i>What's not to like?</i>

219
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,173
<i>Unfortunately, this year</i>

220
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,468
<i>an unwelcome ghost from my
past has turned up uninvited.</i>

221
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:44,180
I was curious to see where
the Weems memorial was placed.

222
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,849
I did sacrifice my life
for the school, after all.

223
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:50,603
I preferred Goody's cryptic
pronouncements to your spectral stalking.

224
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:53,856
I wasn't expecting
anything ostentatious.

225
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:58,986
My portrait joining those on the
wall of illustrious past principals.

226
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:00,363
Perhaps a bronze bust,

227
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:04,575
maybe even a small memorial
shrine with candles.

228
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,285
Even a cuddly toy or two.

229
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:09,414
If you're not gonna give me my psychic
ability back, you're dismissed.

230
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,998
I'm not a genie.

231
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,416
I don't grant wishes.

232
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:16,170
If you want your ability back, that
starts with an honest self-assessment.

233
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:17,797
[students whooping]

234
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,800
Nice catch, Mr. Ottinger!

235
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,051
Who's next?

236
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,139
-Who on Earth is that?
-Principal Dort.

237
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,434
[Weems] Dort?
Never heard of him.

238
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:32,729
And he certainly wasn't on my
list of pre-approved successors.

239
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,272
Happy <i>Día de los Muertos!</i>

240
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,402
Anything for a
t-shirt, am I right?

241
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,613
All right.

242
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:46,617
This is also our Outcast
Day of Remembrance.

243
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:48,745
Following annual tradition,

244
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:52,790
at midnight the remembrance procession
will head to the Nevermore cemetery,

245
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:57,253
and pay our respects to all
those who have gone before us.

246
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,046
Don't worry,

247
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:02,925
it won't be a complete downer because
there will also be food trucks!

248
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:04,802
[students cheering]

249
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:06,095
Food trucks!

250
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,724
Yeah! [laughs]

251
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:13,227
He's a carnival barker
masquerading as an educator.

252
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,397
[Wednesday] Principal Dort.

253
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,943
Wednesday. It is good to see you back
among the living on this Day of the Dead.

254
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,528
The day is young.

255
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:25,198
If there's anything I can
do to help your recovery...

256
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,991
Cancel tonight's festivities.

257
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,367
Tyler's still out there.

258
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,287
According to Sheriff
Santiago, he fled town.

259
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,915
He hasn't. His threat is real.

260
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:37,084
I appreciate your
concern, and your trauma,

261
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,003
but we aren't canceling tonight.

262
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,088
I've invited several
prominent donors,

263
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:44,133
and they will be here to
see our community in action.

264
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:47,261
The only thing they'll see is a
Hyde ripping them limb from limb.

265
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:51,057
In the remote off-chance Tyler
Galpin breaches our wall,

266
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,769
we have a school full of
Outcasts ready to take him on.

267
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,854
Especially Professor Capri.

268
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,941
What does she know
about taking on a Hyde?

269
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,650
She has a history with them.

270
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,695
You aren't alone in
this anymore, Wednesday.

271
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,156
One more question.

272
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:10,075
How do you plan on honoring the
late Principal Weems tonight?

273
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:11,994
[Dort] Honor?

274
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,997
I've spent months trying to
expunge that woman's memory

275
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,333
from every student and
every donor's mind.

276
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,544
She lingers like the
smell of rancid Brie.

277
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,630
[Dort] Blech.

278
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:26,050
After everything I've done to
burnish this school's reputation...

279
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,677
There's your honest assessment.

280
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,845
[sardonic, eccentric
music playing]

281
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,763
[music trails off]

282
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,060
[creature chirring, growling]

283
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,480
There you are, <i>mijo</i>.

284
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,026
I realize your mother and I have
been so focused on your sister,

285
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,778
we haven't been around for you.

286
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,364
It's not just that.

287
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,032
[pensive music playing]

288
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,533
I'm worried about Slurp.

289
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:55,579
I know he's done some bad things,
but it's not his fault he's hungry.

290
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:57,706
[flytrap gurgling]

291
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,543
Losing your first
pet can be hard.

292
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:06,591
Your Uncle Fester had a chupacabra
when he was about your age.

293
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,427
No matter how much of his
blood he gave it to drink,

294
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,011
it wasn't meant to be a pet.

295
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:13,848
I raised Slurp from the dead.

296
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,641
He's my responsibility.

297
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:16,809
And...

298
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,313
I know if they find him,
they'll put him down for good.

299
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:27,444
What about this? What about if
I help you track your zombie?

300
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,239
We'll make it a
father-son adventure.

301
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,449
-Hmm?
-Yeah.

302
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,034
Yeah.

303
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:36,870
[bird cawing]

304
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,547
[taut, suspenseful
music playing]

305
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:49,299
[branches snapping]

306
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,818
[Galpin] This is what
your life has come to?

307
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:12,031
Cowering in a sewer, all alone.

308
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,700
You're not real.

309
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,536
Thank God your mother
can't see you right now.

310
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:20,122
Think of all the hopes and
dreams she had for you.

311
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,957
Her only child.

312
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,334
Her beloved son.

313
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,296
She'd be so disappointed.

314
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,465
You don't get to talk about her!

315
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,800
She deserved better than you.

316
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:35,012
Yeah, on that we
are in agreement.

317
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,057
You always looked
at me with fear.

318
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,476
You knew this would happen.

319
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,856
I tried to protect you.

320
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:48,358
By crawling into a
bottle and ignoring me?

321
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,405
You're in a real jam.

322
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:56,241
You killed your master.

323
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,536
That's a bold move, son.

324
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:02,832
I didn't need her.

325
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,708
I don't need anyone.

326
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:06,877
Turn yourself in.

327
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,421
Leave me alone!

328
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,423
That's the only way out alive.

329
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:14,426
Leave me alone! Leave me
alone! Leave me alone!

330
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:49,503

[eerie, distressing
music playing]

334
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:27,124
[breathing heavily]

335
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,339
[Capri] Wednesday.

336
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,966
Good to see you on your feet.

337
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,844
Not many people can say
they survived a Hyde attack.

338
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:42,056
Well, you're one of them.
Principal Dort told me.

339
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:44,641
Alfie Penn. Name ring a bell?

340
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:48,770
Seems your ex-boyfriend was
shot dead after attacking you.

341
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,941
How dare you snoop in my desk?

342
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,151
You met Alfie at an artist
colony in Woodstock.

343
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:57,446
He was at the forefront of something
titled "violent expressionism,"

344
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,448
otherwise known
as "splatter art."

345
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,201
Until his life began
to imitate his work.

346
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,162
What drove him to
try and kill you?

347

Tyler Galpin is coming.

348
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,960
I need to learn everything
I can about Hydes.

349
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:21,678
I never knew
Alfie's true nature.

350
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,390
Only that we were
happy together.

351
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,477
You fell in love with a monster.

352
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,939
His master was in
love with him too.

353
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:34,775
She ordered him to kill me.

354
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:38,237
Luckily it was a full moon so
I was able to fight him off.

355
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,365
But Alfie accidentally
killed her in the process.

356
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:42,783
It was horrible.

357
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,911
I heard a Hyde can't
survive without a master.

358
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:48,289
Males can't. They go
crazy without one.

359
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:51,917
Psychosis, paranoia,
rapid physical decline,

360
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,586
ultimately premature death.

361
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,380
But the females are
stronger than the males.

362
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:57,590
More dominant.

363
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,758
Has a Hyde ever taken
on a new master?

364
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:02,219
I mean, not that I know of.

365

reckless enough to try?

366

you don't entertain the idea.

367

Of course not.

368

And now my entire legacy
is being denigrated

376
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,628
because I made one
bad normie hire.

I don't do whining,
especially from dead people.

379
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,968
And it was a
monumentally bad hire.

380
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,220

381

what are you up to?

vital information that I need?

388

We never really got a chance
to talk since you woke up.

389
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:53,497
I'm most comfortable with
uncomfortable silence.

390
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:58,877
On the Day of the Dead, we
focus so much on those we lost.

391

I just want to make sure
that those who are still here

sentimental as she was at 16.

with the sickly scent of superiority?

401
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:29,866
Yes. She was lonely, Wednesday.

402

I was not lonely.

403

about Tyler Galpin.

in case he comes back.

[door creaks]

521
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,514
I need an essence of nightshade.

522
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:51,808
Orloff keeps it in the
apothecary cabinet.

523
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:53,393
{\an8}Go pick the lock.

524
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:56,187
{\an8}I'm going to sort out these
non-lethal components.

525
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,150
[mischievous, intriguing
music playing]

526
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,507
[Weems] Instead of leaving with
Enid and going into hiding,

527
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:26,301
you are now using her
as bait to lure a Hyde.

528
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:27,761
This will work.

529
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:30,680
Only if you get close enough
to jab Tyler with a needle.

530
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:34,351
And that assumes the recipe for
Thornhill's brew is correct.

531
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:36,394
You can't even master
your own ability.

532
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:38,521
And now you want
to master a Hyde?

533
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,733
It's the only way to get
Tyler back into his cage.

534
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:46,196
Please. We both know there isn't
an altruistic bone in your body.

535
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,907
This is about your pathological
need to control everything.

536
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,492
Go find some other
distant relative to stalk.

537
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:54,496
Thornhill unlocked
and controlled Tyler

538
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,915
because she was
methodical and detached.

539
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,541
You have feelings for him.

540
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:02,378
I hate Tyler. End of story.

541
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:08,385
Hate is a feeling, Miss Addams.

542
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:13,056
Along with fear, contempt,
concern, and love.

543
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:17,102
All emotions you think can be boxed
up and stored in your subconscious.

544
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:20,188
But that box is a
ticking time bomb.

545
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,148
If you don't find
a way to defuse it,

546
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:24,859
it could explode at the
most calamitous moment.

547
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:29,197
Even if you do succeed,
he turned on Thornhill.

548
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,240
He will turn on you too.

549
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:38,247
[emphatically] Don't do this.

[park patron] Watch it.

558
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,668
What's the matter
with you? Freak.

amp up the scares this year.

[fleshy crunching]

565
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:03,083
Your job is to spook people,

566
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,501
not to make them
poop their pants.

567

Sheriff, we've got multiple incoming
911 calls from Pilgrim World.

570
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:17,389
Zombie's on a killing spree.

571
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,349
Send every car we've got.
Everybody, clear out!

572
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:23,186
10-64 to Pilgrim World.

[speaking Spanish]

574
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:47,669
There's a killer zombie
in the Haunted Hacienda!

575
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,796
-Slurp?
-Pugsley!

576
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:52,799
-This is dangerous.
-Stay here. I don't want you to get hurt.

577
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:54,801
Slurp's my friend.
He'll listen to me.

578
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,678
Wait out here, please!

579
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,179

[Slurp] Pugsley.

584
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,884
Stop.

585
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:45,893
You can talk.

586
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:47,812
And you look human.

587
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:49,189
Well, almost.

588
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:51,524

589
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,194

Go, go, go, go.

This is the

Whoever's in there, come out
with your hands over your head!

You've given me a second chance
at life. I don't want to waste it.

You're my only friend, Pugsley.

595
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:14,797
Let me go.

596
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:17,675
Please.

597
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:20,720
This is your final warning!

598
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,733
[Pugsley] Just me.

599
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,110
No one else is in there.

600
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:41,366
Get the boy and his father
out of here! Move out.

601

Sweep inside and
establish a perimeter!

602

Couldn't find him, Dad.

603
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:55,213
Maybe it's for the best.

Oh, Lurch, be a dear and
bring the car around front.

00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:41,134
I was on my way to Nevermore
when I saw you in the garden,

cutting roses in the moonlight.

611
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,387
I couldn't believe it.

After all these years.

Yes.

She's an angel.

00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:13,708
I'd given up hope, and she...

623
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,502
she saved me.

and get you some help.

No, don't, don't. Please.

00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:30,641
You were always so
kind to me in school.

629
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:35,604
I could really use your
help finding my son.

630

You mean Tyler.

631
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,609
He escaped from Willow Hill too.

00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,237
I know he's heading
for Nevermore.

633
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:47,116
In that case, I
know who he's after.

Outcasts who have gone before us.

and those whose shadow only loomed
large in the hearts of their loved ones.

We honor the Cyclops, the
Yeti, and the Minotaur,

641
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:35,498
and all the Outcast tribes
that no longer walk the earth.

642
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:39,294
May their memory be a blessing.

643
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:46,342
And may their absence be the bitter taste
that reminds us to always stay vigilant.

644
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,345
He's here. Stick to the plan.

isn't full tonight.

You're looking a little rough.

661

Is it because you
killed your master?

about my feelings?

You were right.

I was attracted to you.

But you do know there's only one

I had it under control.

-Is that Tyler's mother?
-Yes.

692

You freed her from Willow Hill.

What deal did you make?

694
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:19,472
Francoise gave me her word
that she would control Tyler,

don't believe in ghosts,</i>

me my whole life."</i>

701
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:50,044
<i>I've always believed that
to be haunted is a choice.</i>

haunted by is our past.</i>

try to shake it free,</i>

00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:01,198
<i>and I can feel time slipping away
like sand through an hourglass.</i>
