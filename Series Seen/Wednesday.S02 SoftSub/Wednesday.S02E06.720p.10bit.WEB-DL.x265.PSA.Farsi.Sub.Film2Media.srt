00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:32,989
[Capri clears throat]

180
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,867
Professor Capri. I was
just checking on Enid.

181
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,452
I'm sure Enid's lips are fine.

182
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:43,374
You know boys aren't allowed
in the girls' dorm solo.

183
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,305
Want to tell me what
happened last night?

184
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:03,061
I know. We should have told
somebody about the Hyde.

185
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,480
No. Not that. What
happened after.

186
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:06,731
In the music room.

187
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,902
[sighs softly] I don't know
what you're talking about.

188
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:18,576
Enid, you transformed
into a werewolf.

189
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:21,079
Without a full moon. I saw you.

190
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,247
[delicate, introspective
music playing]

191
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:25,916
Enid, it's okay.

192
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:31,172
It... It means you
could be an Alpha.

193
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,340
[Enid gasps]

194
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,094
Wait. Me?

195
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,680
We don't know, but
look at the facts.

196
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,473
You're a late bloomer.

197
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:44,018
The first time you wolfed out
was under a blood moon, correct?

198
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:48,565
Those are all classic
signs of a potential Alpha.

199
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,359
They're the strongest
of our kind. Very rare.

200
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,736
If you are one, we
have to manage it.

201
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,363
[phone buzzing]

202
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,576
But don't Alphas
normally end up alone?

203
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,121
Sorry. One minute.
It's Principal Dort.

204
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,914
We're implementing a new curfew.

205
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:08,084
After dinner, everyone's
confined to their rooms.

206
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:11,546
Anyone fails to comply,
barred... from the gala...

207
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:12,755
Oh, Enid.

208
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,256
Don't worry.

209
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:17,844
There's a lot of
misinformation out there

210
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,305
about Alphas
becoming lone wolves,

211
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:25,351
but as long as we get this under
control, there's nothing to worry about.

212
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,436
Okay?

213
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:31,899
[music growing fearful]

214
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:33,067
[breathing shakily]

215
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,279
[music trails off]

216
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,863
Pull.

217
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,078
[Hester] Wednesday.

218
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:47,665
What brings you all this
way on such a dreadful day?

219
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,251
I need help restoring
my psychic ability.

220
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:53,171
The last time I intervened, your
mother burned that spell book.

221
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:54,922
Yes, but you're a Raven.

222
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,549
You must know another way.

223
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,634
Pull.

224
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,350
Every now and then,

225
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:08,978
I crank up my psychic sight
so I can spy on old enemies.

226
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:13,107
Just a few flashes of their
suffering. Usually brightens my mood.

227
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,943
You stopped using it after
what happened to Aunt Ophelia.

228
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,530
Is that what your
mother told you?

229
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,117
Doves can be so emotional,

230
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,915
always living in the past and
wallowing in their feelings.

231
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,709
I made a choice to
leave all that behind.

232
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:35,004
Women like us can't
be burdened by family.

233
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:38,966
We forge our own path,
dig our own grave.

234
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,555
This is one of the Hydes I
accidentally released at Willow Hill.

235
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,016
{\an8}I need to find her.

236
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,684
[suspicious music playing]

237
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:53,230
Have you ever come across
the name Rosaline Rotwood?

238
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,859
Professor Rotwood was
a legendary Raven.

239
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:02,490
She taught runes and ancient
cryptology during my time at Nevermore.

240
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:04,742
I was an amateur tomb raider,

241
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:07,870
so I took to that class
like a leech to blood.

242
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:11,124
In fact, your parents are
slumming in her old cottage.

243
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:14,877
She used to hold secret
soirées in her seance chamber.

244
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,379
She may have served
stale sherry,

245
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,967
but her psychic sight
was extraordinary.

246
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,511
What does this have to
do with my situation?

247
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:30,142
Rotwood is buried in
the Nevermore graveyard.

248
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:34,439
Her headstone is imbued
with her dark energy.

249
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:38,108
If a Raven recites the
inscription etched underneath,

250
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,195
you will be granted
temporary sight.

251
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,450
Thank you, Grandmama.

252
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:51,581
I'm the last person to offer advice, and
you're the last person to accept any,

253
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,792
but... proceed with
caution, my dear.

254
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,212
Pull.

255
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:02,550
[bird squawks]

256
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:06,846
Aw.

257
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,186
Oh, there you are.

258
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,480
Dort turned dinner into
a campus safety TED talk.

259
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,606
Ugh, I had to escape.

260
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:22,361
-Where are you charging off to?
-The Nevermore graveyard.

261
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,196
Hello? Curfew!

262
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,366
If you're not back, the entire dorm
is gonna be barred from the gala.

263
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:29,368
You may have dropped
out of the orchestra,

264
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:32,079
but I've been rehearsing
my dance routine for weeks.

265
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:35,666
I'm not cowering away in the room while
Tyler and his mother are out there.

266
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,251
I'm going to find them.

267
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:38,461
How exactly?

268
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:42,298
That's on a need-to-know basis. After
last night, you don't need to know.

269
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:46,552
Did it ever occur to you that
we're all just trying our best?

270
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:50,598
Trying your best means you're planning on
failing and letting me know in advance.

271
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,767
The fact that you
can be so arrogant

272
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,311
and still make so many bad
decisions is staggering.

273
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:58,564
How was I supposed to know that
Tyler's mother was still alive?

274
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,691
You weren't! That's
the whole point.

275
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:04,904
Your arsonist-slash-firefighter complex
is right there in black and white.

276
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:08,198
You unleash chaos just so you can
stamp it out and then feel superior.

277
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,911
You think you're powerful now
because you finally wolfed out?

278
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:15,956
[breathing tremulously] You have
no idea what I'm capable of.

279
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,543
Now who sounds arrogant?

280
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:21,837
Have you ever put yourself in someone
else's shoes to see how they felt?

281
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:26,717
My shoes are filled with
broken glass and razor blades.

282
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,011
You'd bleed out after two steps.

283
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,180

285

Capri's going house-to-house
doing dorm checks?

286
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,709
How long until she gets up here?

287
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:05,214
That's barely enough time to make
it to the graveyard and back.

288
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,216
I am not missing that gala!

289
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,761
I will literally drag Wednesday
back by her braids if I have to!

290
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:13,263
[dour, foreboding music playing]

291
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,069
[Wednesday] "In
the Raven's shadow,

292
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,822

ephemeral sight."

"Be warned. Should my gaze be
broken, a deadly trick I will play."

[gasp echoing]

297
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:06,025
How dare you enter
my chamber uninvited?

298
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,402
I'm a Raven.

299
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,989
One whose wings
have been clipped.

300
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:15,451
My grandmother told me that if I
read the inscription on your grave,

301
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,036
you would grant me second sight.

302
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,203
[chuckles]

304
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,917
So desperate for my approval.

305
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:28,965
But she never had what it took
to be a truly great Raven.

306
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:33,928
She craved a family so badly, she
fell head over heels with a huckster.

307
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,889
I sense none of that
sentimentality in you.

308
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:41,018
No. The crack in your
monochrome armor is

309
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:42,895
overbearing arrogance.

310
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,232
You positively
reek of the stuff.

311
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,692
Tyler and Francoise Galpin.

312
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,194
I need to find them.

313
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:54,490
There's no time to waste. A
life hangs in the balance.

314
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:58,744
What are you willing to
endure to excavate the truth?

315
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,206
Hold your hand over the flame,

316
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:05,292
and your psychic sight will
be temporarily renewed.

317
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,669
But beware.

318
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,754
If you pull your
palm from the flame,

319
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:11,924
you will break the
Raven's gaze, and...

320
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,302
there will be a price to pay.

[morbidly intriguing

332
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,247
Why am I staring at...

me?

334
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,336
Because we've somehow
swapped bodies.

335
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,795
I don't understand.

336
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:36,425
We were at the graveyard, and now
we're here, and now it's morning.

337
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,094
How the hell did that happen?

338
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,220
You broke the Raven's gaze.

339
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,264
Now it's playing a dirty trick.

340
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,849
How do we swap back?

You always think you're the
smartest person in the room.

I'll let you figure
that one out.

Who are you talking to?

Obviously, it's me. Keep up.

Okay, whatever you did, you need
to fix it. Right frickin' now!

None of this would've happened
if you'd left me alone.

and uncomfortable.

351
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,714
It's probably your
factory setting.

352
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,926
-And I'm warm and clammy.
-Werewolves run hot.

353
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,719
We're hot-blooded creatures.

354
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,180
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!

355
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:27,935
Watching my body contort to your
emotional outbursts is making me queasy.

356
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,397
Nobody can see us
like this, okay?

357
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,399
We'll pretend we have
a contagious disease,

358
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,984
and say we need
to be quarantined.

359
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,067
[wry musical flourish]

360
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,531
You are not walking
out this door.

361
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,616
I'm going back to
Rotwood's grave.

362
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:43,742
Wednesday?

363
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:47,580
I'm scared.

364
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:50,666
-You will get your body back.
-Promise?

365
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,084
[whimpers]

366
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:00,843
[Enid] What are we gonna do?

367
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,761
We tell absolutely no one.

368
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,972
This must remain our secret.

369
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,557
You need to stay
away from Bruno.

370
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,559
And you must avoid my
family at all costs.

371
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:09,810
Especially my mother.

372
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:12,479
We got this, right?

373
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:14,899
I mean, how hard is it to
act like Wednesday Addams?

374
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:16,775
[droll, macabre music playing]

375
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,360
[Bianca] Enid!

376
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,404
Over here. Saved you a seat.

377
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:21,697
Coming, guys!

378
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:24,950
[wry, perplexing music playing]

379
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,038
Get coffee. Sit alone.

380
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,372
Stay out of trouble.

381
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,249
I'll be back soon.

382
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,631
Hmm.

383
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:46,513
Your braids are fire, Elise.

384
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,640
And those shoes
are a vibe, Sophia.

385
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,186
Way to go, you little psycho.

386
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:57,274
I was just delivering your
morning coffee like I always do.

387
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:58,734
You do?

388
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,861
I mean...

389
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:03,447
Right. Of course.

390
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,575
I haven't been able to locate
Isaac Night's student files yet.

391
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:07,743
Who's Isaac Night?

392
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:09,995
Pugsley's zombie.

393
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:15,334
[gasps] Duh! Right. I'm clearly suffering
from extreme caffeine deprivation.

394
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:18,420
A rainbow furracino with an extra
squirt of steak sauce, please.

395
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,880
[quizzical musical flourish]

396
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:24,134
[dryly] I can tattoo my order on
your forehead if that would help.

397
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,223
I thought you were
allergic to color.

398
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,854
I mean, I just say that
to keep up the whole

399
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:38,857
tragic loner, goth
girl aesthetic.

400
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,361
I'll catch you later. Or never.

401
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,529

00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,407

[suspenseful music pulsing]

405
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:00,962
Whoa, whoa. Enid, wait.

406
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:02,798
It's me.

407
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:05,217
[dour music playing]

408
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,303
You said you loved it
when I surprised you.

409
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:10,097
Try again and I'll treat you to
some real pain and suffering.

410
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,686
[slurping loudly]

411
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:23,610
[tense music playing]

412
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,072
[gasps]

413
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:29,491
This is insane!

414
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,868
I was actually
allergic to color.

415
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:33,537
Wednesday.

416
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:36,540
[shakily] I kinda
can't talk right now.

417
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,125
Oh, dear.

418
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,502
I haven't seen your
skin break out like that

419
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:44,214
since Pugsley colored the inside
of your favorite death mask.

420
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,967
Hmm. I have just the remedy.

421
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,136
[dour, uneasy music playing]

422
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,440
Wow!

423
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,942
This cream is amazing.

424
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:09,739
-What's in it?
-Beeswax, stinging nettles, and ash.

425
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:12,117
Ash?

426
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,995
Scraped from the bottom
of a crematorium furnace.

427
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:17,539
One of your grand
mama's beauty secrets.

428
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:20,917
Although it does give your skin
that wonderful corpse-like glow.

429
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:23,712
Well...

430
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:25,255
Thanks, Mom.

431
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:26,423
Mom?

432
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:27,841
That's new.

433
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:31,178
Hmm. Something's
different about you today.

434
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:33,555
I can see it in your eyes.

435
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:37,100
It's like your
spirit is lighter.

436
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:41,063
Well, I'm just trying to
embrace my inevitable decay

437
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,898
with a touch of enthusiasm.

438
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:47,068
Why didn't you take your
umbra mushroom pills?

439
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:51,198
You know you run the risk of an
allergic reaction if you skip a day.

440
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,200
Oh. Right.

441
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,828
My prescription ran out.

442
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:59,706
Well, luckily, I stopped by the
apothecary and picked up your refill.

443
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,875
This will clear it right up.

444
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,794
Got it. Bye.

445
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:06,296
-Since you're turning over a dead leaf...
-[gasps]

446
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:09,591
Perhaps you'd like to come for
family dinner at the cottage tonight?

447
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:12,344
[chuckling] Oh.

448
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:14,304
Uh, tonight's not great for me.

449
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:15,681
Pugsley's coming over.

450
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,141
And your father's
up from the city,

451
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:20,269
and you know how much family
dinners cool his heart.

452
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,354
I would love to come, Mom.

453
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:23,897
I mean, Mother.

454
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,399
But I can't.

455
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,317
Principal Dort just
issued a curfew.

456
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,028
Well, I've already
spoken to him,

457
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:32,364
and he's given you and
Pugsley a pass for tonight.

458
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,867
Isn't that wonderful?

459
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,701
Lurch will pick you up at 7:00.

460
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:39,538
Don't be late.

461
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,499

[grimly determined
music playing]

465
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:07,065
[Weems] Once again, you have
wandered into uncharted territory.

466
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,442
Can't say I didn't warn you.

467
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:11,987
Fine.

468
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,530
How do I undo this?

469
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:16,116
I haven't the foggiest.

470
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:22,039
But given my penchant
for meticulous research,

471
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:24,374
I did discover that
two other Ravens

472
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:28,712
had the audacity to embark on this
foolhardy endeavor before you.

473
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:32,757
-What happened to them?
-They were both dead within 24 hours.

474
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:35,177
Bravo, Miss Addams.

475
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:39,222
It appears you'll be responsible for
Enid's premature death after all.

476
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,808
As well as your own.

477

[forlorn music playing]

[Isaac scoffs]

481
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:57,134
-Ready for another one, sweetie?
-Mmm.

482
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:58,927
-Good?
-Yeah.

483
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,971
-Like it?
-Better than I remember.

484
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:02,138
[Francoise chuckles]

485
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:03,932
[rapping at door]

486
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:20,532
No, it can't be.
It's impossible.

487
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:22,158
Francoise...

488
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,788
Is that any way to
greet your brother?

489
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:28,623
You died.

490
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,501
I held you.

491
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,503
In my arms.

492
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,923
Put the gun down.

493
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,886
Do you remember
the Fourth of July?

494
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,805
Dad caught you with
that Normie kid.

495
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,557
Dylan.

496
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,643
He slapped you so hard.

497
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,813
It was louder than
the fireworks.

498
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:54,691
That was the first
time you transformed.

499
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:03,950
[Francoise sobs softly]

500
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:07,203
I've spent my life
dreaming of this moment.

501
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:11,416
Praying that I
would see you again.

502
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,798
Tyler,

503
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:21,384
this is your Uncle Isaac.

504
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:23,720
[Francoise] Mmm.

505
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:25,388
[chilling music playing]

506
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:31,060
Hello.

507
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:33,980
Tyler.

508
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:37,650
Nice to meet you.

509
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:42,155
[coughs uncontrollably]

510
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:46,868
What's wrong?

511
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,828
[Francoise breathes heavily]

512
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:52,707
It's our condition.

513
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:54,918
Being a Hyde.

514
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,879
I've lived longer than most.

515
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,798
[Isaac] I could still help you.

516
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,800
It was always my dream.

517
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:04,261
To slay the monster inside you.

518
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,263
I only need the right equipment.

519
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,347
Resources.

520
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:10,767
Dr. Stonehurst
stole your diaries.

521
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:15,063
And he's built a version of
your machine at Willow Hill.

522
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:19,067
But he perverted it to give
our abilities to Normies.

523
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:23,029
His daughter Judi, she's
carrying on his research.

524
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:25,323
She's been hunting me.

525
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:27,575
Well,

526
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:29,619
Judi...

527
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,287
retired.

528
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:34,750
Permanently.

529

00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,271
we are whole,

704
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:47,106
just the way we are.

705
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,902
[Agnes] Excuse me, I...

706
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:52,695
Sorry to interrupt.

707
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:55,239
I know I'm not
technically a body part,

708
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:58,659
but... the sign said,
"All are welcome."

709
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,661
And they are.

710
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:05,332
So please, share
whatever's on your mind.

711
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:12,172
I thought at Nevermore,

712
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:14,884
I would finally be seen.

713
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:17,261
[gentle, aching music playing]

714
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:18,971
Have real friends.

715
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,433
But the truth is,

716
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:25,561
I feel more invisible than ever.

717
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:31,191
We want you to know that
we all see you, Agnes.

718
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,488
Make yourself at home.

719
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:41,285
We have another newbie.

720
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:44,121
Welcome, Thing.

721
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:52,630
What would you like to
share with the group?

722
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:57,509
You don't have any idea
where you came from?

723
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:01,722
When you were found
by the Addams family,

724
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:07,144
the only clue to your past
was a silver signet ring.

725
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:13,233
Well, you're fortunate to have
people who care about you.

726
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:17,488
We may never know who
we were attached to.

727
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:22,243
You can't see yourself
as an appendage,

728
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:25,121
but as a whole person,

729
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:28,582
worthy of love and respect.

730
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:33,420
We are more than just
the sum of our parts.

731
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:36,423
But sometimes,

732
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:40,344
the parts are greater
than the whole.

733
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:49,437
-[Morticia gasps]
-[Gomez] Yes!

734
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,106
Bravo, Lurch.

735
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:53,816
You have outdone yourself.

736
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:54,859
[Gomez] Mm-hmm.

737
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,360
[Enid stifling gag reflex]

738
00:44:58,445 --> 00:44:59,780
[cheeky, eccentric
music playing]

739
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:01,365
[Morticia] Delicious.

740
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:02,533
[Lurch growls]

741
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:06,454
Mmm.

742
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:08,080
Ooh, wow.

743
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:12,418
Yes.

744
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:16,754
[disgusted yelp]

745
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,467
Remind me what this is again?

746
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:25,473
Darling, don't you recognize
your favorite family dish?

747
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,058
-Roadkill pot pie.
-[Morticia] Mm-hmm.

748
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:28,267
Of course.

749
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:30,394
Yum!

750
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:33,856
-What's in it?
-[Gomez] Possum.

751
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:36,025
Little guy ran out
right in front of us.

752
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:38,152
Lurch backed up over it twice.

753
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:39,904
Tenderized it. Ooh, yeah.

754
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:43,240
He also added a little
leftover raccoon,

755
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:47,328
which gives that special
woodsy flavor you adore.

756
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:48,579
[weakly] Mmm.

757
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:49,955
[glass clinking]

758
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:51,540
[Lurch groans]

759
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:56,003
Now that we're all here together,
it's time for a serious discussion.

760
00:45:56,086 --> 00:46:00,549
Your father and I have tried to instill
our family values in you children.

761
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:02,760
But we draw the line on lying.

762
00:46:03,635 --> 00:46:05,971
I thought you said lying
was an important life skill.

763
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:08,933
Yes, like in business, politics,

764
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,685
jury duty... that's a big one.

765
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:14,146
You two have been lying to us.

766
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:17,775
And I'll give you one
chance to confess.

767
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:21,820
-There's still a punishment, right?
-Of course. Don't be silly.

768
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:26,617
I lied to you about Slurp.

769
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:30,662
I saw him at Pilgrim
World, and I let him go.

770
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:32,539
I'm really sorry, Pop.

771
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:35,292
So, um...

772
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:37,920
do I get the rack
or iron maiden?

773
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:39,755
We'll flip for it.

774
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:42,216
Come on. Let's go.

775
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:45,344
Please excuse us.

776
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:47,638
You ladies enjoy dinner.

777
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:54,603
Earlier, I caught Enid in Rosaline
Rotwood's secret seance chamber.

778
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:56,605
Any idea why she was snooping?

779
00:46:57,689 --> 00:46:59,608
None, actually.

780
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:01,193
Hmm.

781
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:05,948
I see that bewildered
look in your eyes.

782
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:08,116
It's the same look I
noticed this morning.

783
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,287
-[Enid whimpers]
-And now it makes sense.

784
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,789
Your obsession for
getting your ability back

785
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:16,876
has finally made
you lose your mind.

786
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:17,835
What?

787
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:19,420
But don't worry.

788
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,839
I will have Lurch make
up the guest room.

789
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:25,009
No, that... that... that
really isn't necessary.

790
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:28,721
I sense your presence
again. Show yourself.

791
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:30,389
I demand it.

792
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:33,559
You're still as insufferably
bossy as you were in 10th grade.

793
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:34,810
Larissa?

794
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:37,146
-Who's Larissa?
-Shh!

795
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:39,106
Morticia, it's good to see you.

796
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:40,608
Oh, I just remembered. I...

797
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:41,817
Sit down.

798
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:47,281
I am Wednesday's
new spirit guide.

799
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:49,074
Wait.

800
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:51,660
If you're her guide,
why can't she see you?

801
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:54,580
[Weems] At your beloved
mother's suggestion,

802
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:57,666
Wednesday attempted to
gain temporary second sight

803
00:47:57,749 --> 00:48:00,502
at Rosaline Rotwood's headstone.

804
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:05,257
That's why she dispatched
Enid to search for answers

805
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:07,843
in Rotwood's seance chamber.

806
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:09,553
Except that wasn't Enid.

807
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:11,763
It was Wednesday.

808
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:15,182
Enid?

809
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:17,811
Is that you in there?

810
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:19,688
Where's Wednesday?

811
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:23,234
Locked in the Lupin
cages until the morning.

812
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:24,485
It'll be too late.

813
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:27,613
They only have until
dawn to set this right.

814
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:30,157
We can't help them, Morticia.

815
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,243
They have to save themselves.

816
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:33,369
Mrs. Addams, I...

817
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:37,706
You must free Wednesday and
fix this together before dawn.

818
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:40,543
That's your only chance.

819
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:42,711

821
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:07,152
[Isaac] I hope I'm not
late for the meeting.

822
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:14,702
Hello, Professor.

823
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:15,953
[shocked gasp]

824
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:20,040
Don't you recognize
your star student?

825
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:22,042
It can't be.

826
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:26,088
Isaac Night disappeared

827
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:27,798

828
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:31,009
Correction, Professor.
I died 30 years ago.

829
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:35,389
Never underestimate
the power of science.

830
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:38,434
Isn't that what you told me?

831
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:40,686
Science has nothing
to do with it.

832
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:44,648
You're a perversion of nature.

833

834
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:50,779

[gears whirring frantically]

839
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:04,418
And now I've come to collect.

Isaac! Don't!

841

No! Stop!

Don't worry, Professor.

I wouldn't let such a
great mind go to waste.

A power source for the
machine at Willow Hill.

Tyler.

Your little creeper told me
about your vision of my death.

868
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:02,721
Thanks for the trust.

869
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:09,269
I also know that if we
don't switch back by dawn,

870
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:10,813
we're both going to die.

871

out looking like this.

[Agnes] <i>Wednesday... I know
we currently aren't friends,</i>

but I found them.

I found Tyler Galpin
and Isaac Night.

I took a leaf out of

Agnes, are you insane?
Get the hell out of there!

883
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:44,386
No.

884
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:45,805
It's too late.

885
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:49,392
Sharing my location
with you now.

886
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:54,022
[phone beeping]

887
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:56,942
-They're headed to Willow Hill.
-We need to switch back.

888
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:59,152
After we save Agnes and
take down the Galpins.

889
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:02,030
[music fades]

890
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:06,243
[energy humming]

891
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:20,591
I can finally keep that
promise I made to you.

892
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:24,427
-[Francoise, fondly] Hmm.
-To free you from this horrible curse.

893
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:27,639
[Isaac] Here.

894
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:32,769
-We have to secure you for the procedure.
-Yeah.

895
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:37,190
You think being a
Hyde is a curse?

896
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:40,402
It's the most free
I've ever felt.

897
00:54:42,153 --> 00:54:44,739
[Francoise] That so-called
freedom comes at a price.

898
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:48,410
Every transformation
has a human cost.

899
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:51,204
Until it finally
steals your life.

900
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:57,628
I designed this machine to
remove Outcast abilities.

901
00:54:57,711 --> 00:55:01,131
{\an8}If I can take away your
mother's Hyde side,

902
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:03,049
{\an8}I can stop her from dying.

903
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:17,314
[phone bleeps]

904
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:29,242
[faint clink in distance]

905
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:31,495
Someone else is here.

906
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:32,787
[Isaac] Uh...

907
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:41,880
[Agnes gasps]

908
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,966
Little snoop is one of
Wednesday's friends.

909
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,552
What do you want
me to do with her?

910
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:50,847
Put her in a cell.

911
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:54,059
I'll need a snack once I'm done.

912
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:56,061
[Agnes straining]

913
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,397
This way! The lab is
through that door.

914
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:02,484
[Agnes pants] Ah!

915
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:13,870
[Isaac hums softly]

916
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:18,500
[Tyler] Make yourself at home.

917
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:22,045
We can deal with that
Nevermore brat later.

918
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:25,215
[Isaac] Ready, Francoise?

919
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:30,011
[machinery humming]

920
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:56,621
Wednesday!

921
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:09,591
[door opens]

922
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:11,761
Look who showed up.

923
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:14,514
-Don't forget about me.
-[Tyler grunts]

924
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:16,850
-[Wednesday] Leave her alone!
-No full moon to save you...

925
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:18,184
[Tyler grunts]

926
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:21,146
[panting]

927
00:57:26,484 --> 00:57:28,319
[chains rattling]

928
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:31,239
[Agnes] Wednesday?

929
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:35,494
You need to calm down or
you're gonna wolf out.

930
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:37,746
Too late. Get out!

931
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:39,914
[flesh distending,
bones cracking]

932
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:43,793
[Wednesday groaning]

933
00:57:51,593 --> 00:57:53,720
[machinery whirring
intensifying]

934
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:05,273
[Isaac sputtering]

935
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:12,238
[exhales] Wednesday.

936
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:16,451
[forceful pounding]

937
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:19,245
[pounding continues]

938
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:25,794
[heroic music swelling]

939
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:26,961
[Wednesday snarling]

940
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:37,847
Tyler, no!

941
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:51,528
Wednesday? Wednesday!

942
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,030
Wednesday, we have to go now!

943
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:55,490
[uncontrollable whirring]

944
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:02,205
[heightened, suspenseful
music playing]

945
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:09,546
Let's go!

946
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:13,007
[Francoise] Go! Gotta
get out of here!

947
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:21,099
[music trails off]

948
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:27,522
Are you okay?

949
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:30,233
[breathing heavily]

950
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:33,028
[delicate, emotional
music playing]

951
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:34,904
Thank you for saving my life.

952
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:40,410
I just asked myself,
"What would Enid do?"

953
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:46,374
So you guys did swap bodies.
I knew something was up.

954
00:59:46,457 --> 00:59:49,085
You've been acting
really weird all day.

955
00:59:49,168 --> 00:59:52,088
And you just called her
Wednesday back there, so...

956
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:54,257
we're still friends.

957
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:58,720
Well, don't worry. It's okay.
It's really hard for me too.

958
00:59:58,803 --> 01:00:01,848
But we'll get used to this
whole new look together.

959
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:07,520
Not if I can help it.
Agnes, go back to Nevermore.

960
01:00:08,813 --> 01:00:09,981
Um...

961
01:00:10,064 --> 01:00:11,399
Where are we going?

962
01:00:11,899 --> 01:00:14,527
[grim, imposing music playing]

963
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:19,699
Now what?

964
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:21,076
Rotwood said we had to unravel

965
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:23,870
the innermost secrets of
the lives we stepped into.

966
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:32,295
[scoffs] Fine.

967
01:00:32,837 --> 01:00:33,838
I'll go first.

968
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:37,508
You know what I love
about being Wednesday?

969
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:39,719
Your fearlessness.

970
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:43,931
Except when it comes to
your mom. But... I get it.

971
01:00:45,099 --> 01:00:47,018
[sighs] She can be a lot.

972
01:00:48,269 --> 01:00:50,629
You're afraid she'll never
accept you for who you truly are.

973
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:54,776
That your darkness is even
too much for her to grasp.

974
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:57,737
You'll become the disappointment
she'll never want to speak of.

975
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,155
Just like your aunt.

976
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:01,074
I can feel it in your bones.

977
01:01:02,408 --> 01:01:03,868
That's why you push her away.

978
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:07,664
But maybe she has more to
teach you than you think.

979
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:09,832
[introspective music playing]

980
01:01:13,878 --> 01:01:16,589
The best thing about being
Enid is your quiet strength.

981
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,634
You think being an Alpha
will mean you'll be alone.

982
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:21,928
I won't let that happen.

983
01:01:22,428 --> 01:01:25,098
You need to stop trying so hard
for people who don't deserve it.

984
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:28,476
Like Bruno, who mistook
your kindness for weakness.

985
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:29,603
It's not.

986
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:31,187
It's your power.

987
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:33,607
Which I could barely
handle for one night.

988
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:34,774
[chuckles softly]

989
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:38,486
[emotional music building]

990
01:01:38,569 --> 01:01:41,030
I regret ever
underestimating you.

991
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:44,200
[emotional music swells]

992
01:01:54,919 --> 01:01:56,087
[music trails off]

993
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:57,255
Oh my God.

994
01:01:58,297 --> 01:01:59,507
Wednesday!

995
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:00,633
We're alive!

996
01:02:02,009 --> 01:02:04,554
I feel so warm and fuzzy!

997
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:07,724
And I feel as cold as a cadaver.

998
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:11,853
Which means I'm me
and you're you! Ah!

999
01:02:13,604 --> 01:02:14,647
[jolting stinger]

1000
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:16,149
Enid.

1001
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:19,903
Why don't you go back to
the dorm and get changed?

1002
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:21,237
I'll be right behind you.

1003
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:24,324
Good idea. I could
seriously use a bubble bath.

1004
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:26,492
[moody, uneasy music playing]

1005
01:02:36,961 --> 01:02:40,131
The premonition of Enid's
imminent death is no more.

1006
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:42,341
So why the dour face?

1007
01:02:43,509 --> 01:02:46,679
Your actions today have
put another life at risk.

1008
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:49,931
Follow me.

1009
01:02:54,896 --> 01:02:55,897
[birds cawing]

1010
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:06,824
[Weems] An Addams must die.

1011
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:09,619
The question is...

1012
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,706
which one?

1013
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:14,874
[moody music intensifying]

1014
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:18,002
[music trails off]

1015
01:03:18,085 --> 01:03:20,171
[jauntily macabre
outro music playing]
