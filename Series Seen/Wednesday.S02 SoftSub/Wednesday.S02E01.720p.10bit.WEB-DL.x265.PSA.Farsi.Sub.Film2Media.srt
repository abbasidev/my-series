[music halts]

182
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,075
Here are the ground rules.

183
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,785
No eye contact
without permission.

184
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:50,746
Bullying assistance requests must
be submitted through writing.

185
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,289
And Thing reports to me.

186
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,374
Understand?

187
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:54,458
[Gomez chuckling]

188
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:04,593
[Gomez] Ooh!

189
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,053
Creamies!

190
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,224
[student 1] Wednesday!

191
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:12,184
-There she is!
-Right there, in black!

192
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,314
Can I get your autograph?

193
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,150
I only sign my name in blood.

194
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,236
I would expect nothing less.

195
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,321
I never said it
was my own blood.

196
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,447
[excited titter]

197
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,868
You are done here.

198
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,077
Shoo.

199
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,582
That was disturbing.

200
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,834
You better get used to it.

201
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:40,588
You're a big deal after the whole saving
the school from the demon pilgrim thing.

202
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,298
Why does anyone still care?

203
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:45,926
You're not much of a
clout chaser, are you?

204
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,554
Popularity doesn't play
by the laws of physics.

205
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:51,849
The harder you repel it,
the harder it comes for you.

206
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:55,853
[man] Wednesday Addams!

207
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:58,105
[excitedly] Oh, oh, oh, oh!

208
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:01,567
It is an honor to meet
the savior of Nevermore.

209
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,068
Allow me to introduce myself.

210
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,070
Barry Dort, your new principal.

211
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,031
Um…

212
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:08,782
Would you like a sticker?

213
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,285
Only if you have one that
says "do not resuscitate."

214
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,203
[chortling]

215
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,664
There's that wicked
tongue I've heard about.

216
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:16,832
I love it.

217
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,711
I am reinstating the
Founder's Pyre ceremony.

218
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,463
It's an old Outcast tradition.

219
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:25,007
Big bonfire. Tomorrow night.

220
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,594
And the best part is, I want
you to be our student of honor.

221
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,262
I'd rather be
burned at the stake.

222
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:34,266
Aw! Please consider it. I want
us to be allies in this struggle.

223
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,309
What struggle?

224
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,728
Returning Nevermore
to its glory days.

225
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,563
I hate to speak ill of the dead,

226
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:42,316
but in this case,
Weems really fudged up.

227
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,652
I don't like to speak
ill of the dead either.

228
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,695
It's much more fun to
demonize the living.

229
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,739
-[eccentric music playing]
-[shocked laughter]

230
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,616
[student] Yes!

231
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,379
[muffled clattering, clamoring]

232
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,470
We need to set better
traps out here.

233
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,892
["Um Oh Ah Yeh" by
Mamamoo playing]

234

[peppy pop music playing]

236
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,654
-Howdy, roomie.
-Enid.

237
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,866
All right! Everyone out.
Thanks for the help.

238
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,201
[chatter and music subside]

239
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:35,995
-[student 1] Come on.
-[student 2] Told ya!

240
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,748
Don't put too much
pressure on it.

241
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,876
No pressure. Right. Got it.

242
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,212
Catch up with you later
at the lupin cages?

243
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:47,464
-With the others.
-Absolutely, Bruno.

244
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,591
Can't wait.

245
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:53,721
[exhales]

246
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,305
How was your vacay?

247
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,474
Because I had the
best summer ever,

248
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,768
and I've been dying to
tell you all about it.

249
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,563
I'm sure I'll want to kill
you after you tell me, so…

250
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:03,814
We both win.

251
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,777
Well, I'll spare you
the details, but…

252
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:12,740
I did get you a gift at
Lupinpalooza in Golden Gate Park.

253
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,492
Don't worry. It's not a snood.

254
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,165
Get it? Like Beowulf?

255
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,250
I thought you'd love
the literary reference.

256
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,295
Nothing like a bad pun to throw
dirt on the coffin of epic poetry.

257
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:30,174
I got you a gift as well.
From my summer travels.

258
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:32,426
[somber music playing]

259
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,015
[Enid, shakily] Uh… Oh.

260
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,224
Thank you.

261
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:44,438
I mean, it is a little creepy,
but, um, the curls are super soft.

262
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:45,981
It's made from real human hair.

263
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,317
Hmm.

264
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:52,321
I just have so many
goals this year.

265
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,364
[sighs] I wanna secure
my place in the pack,

266
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:57,409
become dance troupe captain, and
finally join the Nightshades.

267
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:58,494
What about you?

268
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:02,289
Avoid people and work on my
new Viper de la Muerte novel.

269
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,042
Doesn't sound like much
of a personal evolution.

270
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,127
I don't evolve. I cocoon.

271
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:10,589
Speaking of your novel, was
that publisher interested?

272
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,302
I call it death by
a thousand notes.

273
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,637
Ooh…

274
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,598
This one here just
looks like a typo.

275
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:24,686
It's not. That's the Old English
spelling for dismemberment.

276
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,814
This novel was two
years of my life.

277
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:30,359
They'll have to pry it out of my cold,
dead hands before I change a single word.

278
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,527
[knocking at door]

279
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:35,072
That better not be any more
brattish autograph hounds.

280
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:38,075
Tell me about it. We seriously
need to set some boundaries.

281
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:41,245
Let's post hours to sign
stuff in the student lounge.

282
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,332
Hi, Wednesday. How
was your summer?

283
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:46,834
I scalped a serial killer.

284
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,459
Huh.

285
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:51,213
Is, uh… Is Enid around?

286
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,841
She left earlier with the pack.

287
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,468
I threatened to neuter them
if they didn't get out.

288
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,428
Well, would you mind
giving her this?

289
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,355
[sighs] Thanks for covering.

290
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:11,775
I know the only thing you hate more
than color is relationship drama.

291
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:15,362
Machiavelli once said that friendship is
watching a person's slow drip of miseries

292
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:18,699
and feeling honored to be present
for their most dismal moments.

293
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:19,950
Does that mean…

294
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:22,411
In 25 words or less. Go.

295
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,581
I'm not sure how I feel
about Ajax anymore.

296
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,583
He's sweet and cute,

297
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,752
but he's still in love with
the old me, and I've changed.

298
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,504
Hey, look at that.
Exactly 25 words.

299
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,173
Talk to him and
get it over with.

300
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:37,176
If I do that, then it'll be
like an arrow through his...

301
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,343
[Enid yelps]

302
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,428
Holy crap!

303
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,850
[suspenseful music playing]

304
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:48,854
"Welcome back, Wednesday.
I'm still watching."

305
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,691
-Wait. You have a stalker?
-Don't be jealous.

306
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,487
[distorted audio whooshes]

307
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,789
I didn't see the stalker.

308
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,417
You've got a little something.

309
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,585
It's nothing.

310
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,095
[gasping]

311
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,766
Caliban Hall.

312
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,061
My old stomping ground.

313
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:30,771
[laughing]

314
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,274
Hi, Pugsley. I'm...

315
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:35,859
Ah!

316
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,862
Electricity. Cool.

317
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:41,365
And you must be Janet.

318
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,575
Wednesday told us all about you.

319
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,495
[Gomez] Caliban. I put that up.

320
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:50,332
Sue and I weren't sure we wanted
Eugene to come back to Nevermore.

321
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,541
But he insisted.

322
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,168
I did help save the school.

323
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,921
[gasps] I remember that day.

324
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:58,006
What was it like getting
gutted by a Hyde?

325
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:02,177
I still wake up
screaming sometimes.

326
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:03,761
Whoa.

327
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:05,472
That's… awesome!

328
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,898
[Janet] Why don't we
give the boys some space?

329
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,937
Lurch will be up
with your things.

330
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,772
And we'll see you downstairs.

331
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,320
Remember, boys,

332
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:23,699
the friends you make here will
be your brothers for life.

333
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,118
You'll kill for each other,

334
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:29,079
and provide alibis.

335
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:30,664
-[Eugene chuckles weakly]
-Hmm.

336
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,376
[overwhelmed exhale]

337
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:37,546
What's with the bugs?

338
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,464
[Eugene] At first, I
could only control bees,

339
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:42,092
but lately I've been able to
control other insects too.

340
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,344
Watch this.

341
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:50,017
They're so… juicy.

342
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,228
Perfect for late-night munchies.

343
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,898
They're pets, not snacks.

344
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,905
Maybe after we unpack,
we could hang out?

345
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,074
Actually, I'm meeting
up with some other guys.

346
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,158
I could tag along.

347
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,745
They're kind of new-ish friends.

348
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:12,205
I don't mind. It's not
like I have any old ones.

349
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:15,334
I owe your sister a lot, which is
why I agreed to be your roommate.

350
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:18,045
Let's just see how this
pans out first, okay?

351
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,173
Yeah. Sure.

352
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,133
[knocking at door]

353
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:24,676
Yo, bee boy!

354
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:28,638
-Oh, you've grown.
-Ajax. What are you doing here?

355
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,099
I'm your new resident advisor.

356
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:34,519
-If you have any questions...
-Can you stone me with your snakes?

357
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:35,645
That's not gonna happen.

358
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:38,732
Are you and Enid still together?
Or she finally come to her senses?

359
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,985
Do you two have any
dorm-related questions?

360
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:46,615
Okay. Well, welcome to Caliban.
It's going to be a great year.

361
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:57,834
[student 1] That's her.

362
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,045
-[squeals] I can't believe it.
-[student 2] My God.

363
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:02,839
I liked it better when
I was feared and hated.

364
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:09,763
Principal Dort, have you met
our little angel of death?

365
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:13,600
Yep. I'm sure Wednesday would enjoy
having you around more this year.

366
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:15,227
What do you mean, around more?

367
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:19,022
Principal Dort just asked me to
chair the Gala Fundraising Committee.

368
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:21,817
[Dort] Vincent Thorpe
chaired the last three years,

369
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,820
but after Xavier was
falsely accused of murder,

370
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,697
he pulled his son and his
endowment from Nevermore.

371
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,408
Xavier's not coming
back this year?

372
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:31,910
He's heading to Reichenbach
Academy in Switzerland.

373
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:34,746
I spent the summer there
as an exchange student.

374
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:38,375
I remember, darling. It was
the longest summer of my life.

375
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:39,458
[Gomez] Oh…

376
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:43,338
I realize I've ambushed you.

377
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,590
No, I usually enjoy
a good ambush.

378
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:48,176
Especially when it
involves daggers.

379
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,011
[Morticia snickers, coos]

380
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,888
Why don't you think
about it overnight?

381
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:56,643
Tish and I will discuss
it on the ride home.

382
00:23:57,144 --> 00:24:00,313
Actually, I… I was hoping
to keep you a little closer.

383
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,738
I thought the gardener's cottage
was reserved for faculty.

384
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:11,408
Marilyn Thornhill
lived here last year,

385
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:13,243
but thanks to Wednesday,

386
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:16,204
she is now enjoying
much tighter quarters,

387
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,330
in prison.

388
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:19,916
Not pine box tight,
but a girl can dream.

389
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:22,043
It's yours for the night.

390
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,838
And if you decide to
become our gala chair,

391
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:27,299
consider this your
home away from home.

392
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:28,633
I'll wait outside.

393
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,438
[Morticia gasps]

394
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,524
Who decorated this place?

395
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:46,485
A homicidal maniac.

396
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,862
Now, you shouldn't
cast aspersions, dear.

397
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:52,782
Not all homicidal maniacs
have such ghastly taste.

398
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:56,286
Nothing your putrefying touch
couldn't fix, Cara Bella.

399
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:59,831
Hey, Dad, I found some old
mousetraps under the sink.

400
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,291
-You want a snack?
-Yeah.

401
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:06,129
Why would you want to
be in charge of a gala?

402
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:11,259
Well, I wasn't expecting
things to change so quickly.

403
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,929
Pugsley shot up like
poison oak this summer,

404
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:16,890
and now that you're
both at Nevermore,

405
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:20,435
I have been wondering what
my next chapter might be.

406
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:24,648
The thought of you and Father
in the house alone unsupervised

407
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:28,068
fills me with a sense of dread I
usually reserve for costumed mascots.

408
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:31,655
But I won't consider this if
it makes you uncomfortable.

409
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:33,990
I was born
uncomfortable, Mother.

410
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:39,538
I know it's been
hard… with Goody gone,

411
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:43,416
and no one from our bloodline reaching
out to be your new spirit guide.

412
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,502
But if I was here,

413
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,255
I could be of assistance.

414
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,257
Temporarily, of course,

415
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,801
until a new guide
presents themselves.

416
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:54,803
You're a Dove, I'm a Raven.

417
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:57,097
We're on different paths.
You said so yourself.

418
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,432
I've had experience with Ravens.

419
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:03,687
Are you talking
about your sister?

420
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:09,025
You've never been very
forthcoming about Aunt Ophelia.

421
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,702
You remind me a lot of her.

422
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,038
Especially as
you've gotten older.

423
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:25,000
You don't need to
worry about me, Mother.

424
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:28,044
You should be
focused on Pugsley.

425
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,964
We both know being tall and
male will only get him so far.

426
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:33,258
Besides, he's got the
brains of a dung beetle

427
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:35,594
and the ambition of
a French bureaucrat.

428
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,807
-[door squeaks open]
-What is it, querida?

429
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:41,891
[door closes]

430
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:45,270
Wednesday is hiding
things from me.

431
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:49,274
I will not let
history repeat itself.

432
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:51,359
[somber, thoughtful
music playing]

433
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,242
I can handle my mother.

434
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:03,872
I'm not asking for her help
because I don't need it.

435
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,498
I don't need yours either.

436
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:08,543
Keep your nosy fingers
out of my business.

437
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,921
[siren wailing in distance]

438
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,006
[siren halts]

439
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:16,426
[chilling music playing]

440
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:23,475
[officer] The victim's Carl
Bradbury, local private investigator.

441
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:24,684
Real sleaze.

442
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:27,687
Witnesses are Greg Mulligan
and Debbie Prizeman.

443
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:31,524
Greg's the manager of the Piggly Wiggly
and Debbie's one of his cashiers.

444
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:36,196
So Bradbury was out here catching our
supermarket sweethearts in a tryst,

445
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:39,157
when he got attacked by a
squad of kamikaze crows.

446
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,993
[officer] This is a
first, even for Jericho.

447
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,358
[Santiago] Get the body to the
morgue before he gets ripe.

448
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:48,792
Wednesday, can I help you?

449
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,418
Just admiring the view.

450
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:53,713
Sheriff Santiago.

451
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:56,466
I promise to be better
than my predecessor.

452
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:58,134
That's an exceptionally low bar.

453
00:27:58,218 --> 00:27:59,219
[scoffs]

454
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:03,306
[car doors slamming]

00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,100
[engine turning over]

456

[tires skidding]

457
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,770
[tense, frantic music playing]

458
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:13,858
[grunts, groans]

459
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:15,443
Ow…

460
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:18,613
Galpin? What are you doing here?

461
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:22,325
The victim was a friend
of mine. Carl Bradbury.

462
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:25,912
We were working a case together,
and that's what got him killed.

463
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:27,706
I play cello, not violin.

464
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:31,459
Bradbury stumbled onto something.
Said it could affect Outcasts.

465
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:34,963
-We're starting to scratch the surface.
-You care about Outcasts now?

466
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:36,965
My son is an Outcast.

467
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,717
Yeah, I know what
he's done, but…

468
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,052
Ms. Thornhill, she turned
him into a monster.

469
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,804
Tyler was always a monster.

470
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:47,475
She just unlocked that in him.
People don't change. Look at you.

471
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,935
You're still a
broken, deluded man

472
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:50,854
who can't hide behind
his tin badge anymore.

473
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:52,605
Badge never stopped you, did it?

474
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:57,068
I could use your help getting
to the bottom of this.

475
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:01,740
You didn't just wind up at that
crime scene by accident, Addams.

476
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:04,576
You were drawn to it
like a moth to a flame.

477
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:11,040
It's a shame your psychological insight
couldn't help you save your own son.

478
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:13,126
[tense music warbling]

479
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,797
If you change your
mind, you come find me.

480
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:18,882
[crow caws overhead]

481
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:23,052
Just remember… the birds
are always watching.

482
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,181
[caws menacingly]

483
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:44,240
Tonight, you're gonna hear
the tale of the Skull Tree.

484
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:49,245
It's Caliban Hall tradition to tell
this story on the first night of school.

485
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,955
[thunder crashes]

486
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:58,838
[Ajax] There once was a brilliant
boy with a fragile heart.

487
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,549
He spent his days in bed,

488
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,928
drawing all the incredible machines
he planned to build someday.

489
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:07,180
[delicate, mournful
music playing]

490
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:09,849
Now the doctors, they only
gave him months to live.

491
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,436
So he decided to
design his own heart.

492
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:18,733
So that his body could keep
up with his dazzling mind.

493
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,235
[beating steadily]

494
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,321
[beating halts]

495
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:31,162
The operation was successful.

496
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,748
But the clockwork heart
had changed the boy.

497
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,461
He became cold,

498
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,422
and driven by ambition.

499
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,808
When he arrived at Nevermore,

500
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:55,562
he was hailed as the greatest
mind to ever walk the halls.

501
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:56,855
[electricity crackles]

502
00:30:57,605 --> 00:31:00,066
But his inventions
became more dangerous.

503
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,403
Until one night…

504
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:08,116
His genius cost him his life.

505
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,038
Now, legend has it,

506
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:17,750
his body is buried at the
foot of the Skull Tree

507
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:19,586
in an unmarked grave.

508
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:24,257
But if you put your ear to
the skull's hollow left eye…

509
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,592
[tick echoing]

510
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:28,553
…you can still hear
his clockwork heart.

511
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:30,971
Tick,

512
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:32,598
tick,

513
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,267
tick.

514
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:38,771
Only the bravest in Caliban
Hall have ventured out at night

515
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:42,859
to take the dare to listen to
the tick of the clockwork heart.

516
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:46,321
So will you?

517
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,287
[music fades out]

518
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,371
[door opens]

519
00:31:58,833 --> 00:31:59,834
[door closes]

520
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:03,671
Miss Barclay, thanks
for making the time.

521
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:06,257
What a wonderful first
day it's been, hasn't it?

522
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:09,844
Oh, it's so nice to see this place
brimming with Outcast energy.

523
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:14,015
Our most famous
alumni would be proud.

524
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,354
I've been watching you.

525
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,690
How you interacted
with your peers.

526
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,734
You know, charisma
is something that…

527
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:27,195
Well, it can't be
learned. It's a gift.

528
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,739
And you positively ooze it.

529
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:33,785
I'm guessing you have some political
aspirations in your future?

530
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:37,121
I like the idea of creating
real change for Outcasts.

531
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,415
Well, what if I told you

532
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:42,710
that you can start
creating that change today?

00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,838
As the fundraising
gala's student liaison.

534
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,884
We really need to heat things up
if we're going to hit our target.

535
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:54,222
And you have the sizzle
factor I've been looking for.

536
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:55,223
Uh…

537
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,725
Wow. I'm honored.

538
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,687
But I'm not sure I have time
to take on something like that.

539
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:02,730
I'm really sorry.

540
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:06,526
Me too.

541
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:10,279
I mean, you are a
scholarship student, right?

542
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,073
The school is in a
financial pickle,

543
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,826
and if we don't meet
our fundraising goals,

544
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:19,205
I may be forced to let some of
the scholarship students go.

545
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,840
I know how people
feel about sirens.

546
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,467
But I don't share that view.

547
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:35,888
No Outcast should be
limited or shamed.

548
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,682
Is that why you're asking me?

549
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:39,434
Because I'm a siren?

550
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:43,604
Using your powers of persuasion for
a good cause should be applauded.

551
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:46,065
I'm sure you agree.

best for Nevermore.

look at that schedule of yours,

554
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:53,990

squeeze this in?

decision tomorrow.
