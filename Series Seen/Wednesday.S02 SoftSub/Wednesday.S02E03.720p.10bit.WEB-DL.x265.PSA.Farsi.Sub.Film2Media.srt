They were being led
by a one-eyed crow.

00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,203
[grunts, yowls]

177
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:41,331
Did you hear that? He
said his first word.

178
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,833
Br...

179
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,376
That's right, I am your bruh!

180
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:46,377
[Eugene] He's a zombie.

181
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:50,047
He's not trying to call you his
bruh. He's trying to say "brains."

182
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,593
Don't use the Z word.

183
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:55,428
He's sensitive.

184
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,347
How do you not know this?

185
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,223
We're supposed to
be his friends!

186
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,685
No biting! No biting! Bad Slurp!

187
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,771
This is way too dangerous.
We need to tell someone.

188
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,105
No!

189
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:08,816
They'll take him away,
or worse, put him down.

190
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:12,278
He's already dead. We can't leave him
here alone while we're off camping.

191
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:13,863
Don't worry about that.

192
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,157
I already got that covered.

193
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,795
[officiant] May the
road rise to meet you.

194
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,130
May the wind be at your back.

195
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:36,510
May the sunshine warm your face, and
may the rains fall upon your fields.

196
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:41,015
May God hold you always. Amen.

197
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,392
Two mourners.

198
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,938
That's two more than
Galpin ever deserved.

199
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,065
[Santiago] The department
had to send an official.

200
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,900
He was a former sheriff.

201
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:53,444
I lost the coin toss with Ryken.

202
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,531
And I'm here representing Tyler.

203
00:10:56,614 --> 00:11:00,660
He rather grimly asked me to make
sure his father was really dead.

204
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:01,703
What's your excuse?

205
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,038
I'm mixing business
with pleasure.

206
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:05,706
Funerals are a hobby.

207
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:09,502
And killers have a habit of showing
up to their victims' interments.

208
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:13,381
Dr. Fairburn tells me you
visited Tyler at Willow Hill.

209
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,467
He won't give you clues.

210
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,720
He'll send you
down rabbit holes.

211
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,055
It doesn't take years of
police work to see that.

212
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:25,142
It wasn't years of police work that
exposed Tyler as a Hyde. It was me.

213
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,103
Then I shouldn't
have to warn you

214
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:30,523
to stay out of the crosshairs
of another unhinged Outcast.

215
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:34,360
Whoever killed Galpin and
Bradbury means business.

216
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,904
Don't tempt fate, Ms. Addams.

217
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,658
Did Galpin ever visit Tyler?

218
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:44,537
You don't really expect
me to tell you that.

219
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,083
Once.

220
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:54,338
Within seconds, Tyler transformed. Almost
ripped through those titanium bars.

221
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:58,885
It took five minutes with a shock collar
before he returned to his human form.

222
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,469
Never seen anything like it.

223
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,931
Pure, undiluted rage.

224
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:08,436
This killer, I think
they're an Avian.

225
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:12,356
The ability to control birds.

226
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,401
Intriguing theory.

227
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:20,072
Rest assured, we have no
Avian patients at Willow Hill.

228
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,409
I appreciate your candor.

229
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:29,331
Like you said, the only reason that Tyler
is safely locked away is because of you.

230
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,294
I think that's worth a little
off-the-record quid pro quo.

231
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,631
That's more than
Galpin ever gave me.

232
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,428
[mysterious, unsettling
music playing]

233
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,143

[keyboard clacking]

236
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:02,198
Oh! Welcome to the
Inn at Apple Hollow.

237
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,365
Checking in?

238
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:07,244
I need the key to room 302.

239
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,295
This guest is not
to be disturbed.

240
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,130
And I was never here.

241
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:29,975
It's me.

242
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,773
Mom?

243
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:36,941
[Gabrielle gasps]

244
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:43,448
I told you to keep these closed.
You haven't been out, have you?

245
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,574
I've been glued to the news.

246
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:51,914
{\an8}Yeah. I heard the FBI raided the
Morning Song compound this morning.

247
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,624
But Gideon wasn't there.

248
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,043
I'm scared.

249
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:59,505
The only way you were leaving that
cult was in handcuffs or a body bag.

250
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,674
-I wasn't gonna let that happen.
-I know.

251
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:09,640
Look, Gideon found you
at your most vulnerable.

252
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:11,893
I'm not blaming you.

253
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:12,977
[Gabrielle] You should.

254
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,313
We both know the only
reason he married me

255
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:19,066
was to help him recruit people so
that he could steal their money.

256
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,027
Water under the bridge.

257
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,781
The hard part is over.

258
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,365
I got you out.

259
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:29,702
Now you just have to
stick to the plan.

260
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:34,623
You got the evidence that Gideon's a fraud
and I sirened those feds into action.

261
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,377
{\an8}They're going to find him.

262
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:42,089
And then, once he's in
custody, we'll be free.

263
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,302
I promise I will keep you safe.

[Wednesday] <i>This
investigation has flat lined.</i>

<i>The only chance for resuscitation
is by taking drastic measures.</i>

266
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:59,357
Agnes, when you sent me
those stalker text messages,

267
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,400
how did you unlock
Galpin's phone?

268
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,409
The nose is a little bigger.

[Agnes] Nice
shape-shifting, Josephine.

Anything for Wednesday Addams.

275
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:32,723
I grabbed what I could from Galpin's
house before the cops did a sweep.

276
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:36,268
For our first case together,
I wanted to over-deliver.

277
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,690
I find your lack of boundaries infuriating
and your fawning devotion irksome.

278
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:45,611
But your ability does have
its investigative perks.

279
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,532
She's even crueler in person.

280
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,784
Leave. You're both dismissed.

00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,915

[Wednesday] Bullpen?

285
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:04,964
Bradbury hasn't been
a cop for years.

286
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,634
Doubt he was talking about the
bullpen at the sheriff's station.

287
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:12,513
I think we're looking for an
address to a house or apartment.

Yes, but how do we get there?

Looks like the great
outdoors beckons after all.

294
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,883
Pack weapons.

Good morning, my
fellow Outcasts!

So wonderful to see your
bright and shining faces.

00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,287
The buses are already here.

302
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,665
Be careful loading
those coffins.

303
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,875
Number one, look
out for each other.

Number two, have fun!

00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:28,881
This is my last taste of
civilization for two whole days.

306
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:32,385
I'll get a venti furraccino, two
pumps chocolate, one pump strawberry,

307
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,678
and an extra pump of
steak sauce, please.

308
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,556
Guess you weren't ready
to commit to anything.

[uneasy] Hey.

310
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:44,146
I know you like to change your mind
about outfits until the last minute.

00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,319
Yeah, I've been trying to work really
hard on my over packing addiction,

313
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,238
but so far I've
failed miserably.

Looked like you
needed some help.

We're going to need to go over
some ground rules with everyone,

00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,258
I managed to triangulate the
exact coordinates of the cabin.

335
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,594
It's a brisk 30-minute
hike from our camp.

336
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,971
I took the liberty of
plotting multiple routes.

337
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:00,556
She tried to kill me, remember?

338
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:03,517
Yes, but she failed, which
proves she's only an amateur.

339
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,269
Ouch.

340
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:07,938
I... I deserved that.

341
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,399
Take my pack.

342
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:12,901
Secure me a window seat.

343
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,280
I'll be sleeping
with one eye open.
