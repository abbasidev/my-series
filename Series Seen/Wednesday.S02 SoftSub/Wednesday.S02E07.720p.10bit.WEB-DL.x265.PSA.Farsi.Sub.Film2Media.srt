[funky calypso

2
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:31,156
[bartender] What can I get you?

3
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:33,367
[Dort] Three rocks, two
fingers of Jack, and a...

4
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,952
[bartender] One splash of water.

5
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,870
You can never go wrong
ordering a Sinatra.

6
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:42,792
Wait. You look familiar.

7
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:47,255
You were in <i>The Crucible</i> at
the Jupiter Dinner Theater.

8
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:49,091
Your John Proctor
was spellbinding.

9
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:53,095
The audience was hanging on your
every word, particularly the ladies.

10
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,512
You saw that show?

11
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,474
You're the only one
who's ever remembered.

12
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,559
I haven't seen you
at Tiki Tails before.

13
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:01,979
-I'm Arnold Hunt.
-Barry Dort.

14
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,772
I manage one of the Sirens.

15
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:05,148
Gabrielle.

16
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:15,617
I figured a talented guy like you would
be knocking them dead out in Hollywood.

17
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,036
I mean, you certainly
have the looks, charisma.

18
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,871
I took my shot in LA.

19
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:24,126
Even landed a recurring on a
soap opera. <i>Medical Affairs.</i>

20
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:28,213
No way. [chuckles] That was my mom's
favorite show, God rest her soul.

21
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:30,215
She never missed an episode.

22
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:32,634
I played Dr. Gideon Sterling.

23
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:35,303
Until my long-lost brother came
back from the dead, stole my wife,

24
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:36,888
and they blew me
up in my Porsche.

25
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,473
Tough break.

26
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:41,018
Yeah, career took a...
a nosedive after that,

27
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:44,020
so I packed up my Corolla
and moved back home.

28
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:49,317
Luck is what happens when
preparation meets opportunity.

29
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:53,697
And you're in luck because, boy, do
I have the right opportunity for you.

30
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,449
I don't need a manager, pal.

31
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:59,202
-Those days are long gone.
-I... I'm talking about something bigger.

32
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,872
I see a lot of broken
people in my travels,

33
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:05,959
especially Outcasts, and I
have ideas how to fix them.

34
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:09,838
I want to create a place where
like-minded people come together

35
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:13,592
to follow a shared vision
of enlightenment and growth.

36
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:14,676
Sounds like a cult.

37
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:17,345
Nobody likes the C-word.

38
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:20,015
I prefer the term "movement."

39
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:22,392
I have an entire business plan,

40
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:26,229
and I even wrote an
instruction manual

41
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:28,481
on how to build a better life.

42
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,570
I'm self-aware enough to know that this
mug isn't going to convince anyone.

43
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,865
I've seen you on stage, Arnold.

44
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:40,577
You have that
indefinable star quality,

45
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,288
and this is the part
you were born to play.

46
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:45,207
You're serious.

47
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,292
You remember <i>The Wizard of Oz.</i>

48
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:50,420
I'm like the guy Toto
finds behind the curtain,

49
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,380
secretly pulling the levers.

50
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:55,300
You will be the great
and powerful Oz,

51
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:57,135
the face of our movement,

52
00:02:57,218 --> 00:03:00,472
the inspirational leader
who touches people's souls,

53
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:03,683
and persuades them to part
with their hard-earned cash

54
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:08,313
for a chance to be a part of
something bigger than themselves.

[intriguing music playing]

56
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,905
So does this
movement have a name?

57
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,534
How about Morning Song?

58
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:25,955
Because every dawn brings
the light of a new day.

59
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,833
So, what do you say?

60
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,887

62

[Bianca] No, you can't
do that. [laughs]

63
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,994
Here.

64
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,372
[door creaking open]

65
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,211
Principal Dort, I can explain.

66
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,379
[Dort] No need, Bianca.

67
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:18,591
Your mother and I
go back a long way.

68
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,343
Don't we, Gabrielle?

69
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,595
[mysterious music playing]

70
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,929
[Gabrielle] Ah...

71
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:26,849
Who do you think introduced her
to Gideon all those years ago?

72
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:29,936
You're part of Morning Song?

73
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,480
I <i>am</i> Morning Song.

74
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:34,482
And we had a good thing going

75
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:38,111
until you two poked your tails
in and stirred things up.

76
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:40,655
Fortunately, I
don't hold grudges.

77
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:42,324
What do you want, Barry?

78
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,868
By my count, you've been
living here rent-free.

79
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,289
But the free ride is over.

80
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,710
It's time to get
back to work, ladies.

[indistinct chatter]

86
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:15,106
How much longer is
this going to take?

87
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:18,235
I can't have my guests
arrive to a crime scene.

88
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,612
I assumed you were
canceling the gala,

89
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,156
out of respect for
your late colleague.

90
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:27,869
Oh, I know Professor Orloff would
want us to keep calm and Outcast on.

91
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:29,454
That's the Nevermore way.

92
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:32,999
Doubt anyone's going to show
up once this hits the press.

93
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:37,378
Perhaps we can just say there was
an unfortunate classroom accident.

94
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,842
Do you really want it out there that
the Jericho Sheriff's Department

95
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:45,178
still hasn't caught
a killer zombie?

96
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,305
This isn't over.

97
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:50,350
From now on, my deputies
handle campus security.

-That's a non-negotiable.

[birds cawing]

100
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:02,779
We both know Santiago and her crew have
no chance against two Hydes and a zombie.

101
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,072
[Santiago] Let's move.

102
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:06,699
Your newfound cynicism
is refreshing.

103
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:09,994
Only you would leave psychic
scar tissue in a body swap.

104
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,957
Nice try telling me
to stay invisible.

105
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,709
Shh, save your apologies.

106
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,586
I'm not even a little sorry.

107
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,755
And you should be grateful
we came to rescue you

108
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,799
when there's a
premonition I'd die.

109
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,509
And yet it never comes to pass.

110
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:26,636
Worst premonition ever.

111
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,138
-[scoffs]
-The premonition has changed.

112
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:31,724
You're no longer
the one who dies.

113
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,810
Really? Yes!

114
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,231
Wait. Who dies?

115
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:39,524
An Addams.

116
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:43,820
Which is why I need to flush out Isaac and
the Galpin family before he gets to mine.

117
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,656
Your search may
start closer to home.

118
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:56,707
-Ahh.
-Mmm!

119
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,334

[grim music building]

121
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,804
What has your braids in a
twist, my little tempest?

122
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:13,015
The latest exhumation from the growing
secrets you've been keeping from me.

123
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,477
Not only have you known the
identity of Pugsley's zombie...

124
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,773
Isaac Night was your roommate.

125
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,817
He was more than that.

126
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,278
He was my closest friend.

127
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,655
Your father was the only
one who could charm his way

128
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:29,574
into Isaac's clockwork heart.

129
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:33,953
I tried to protect him from people
who wanted to exploit his genius.

130
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,705
Like Augustus Stonehurst.

131
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,124
That's why he built the
lab for him in Iago Tower.

132
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:42,295
Stonehurst saw him as the key to unlocking
the secrets of Outcast abilities.

133
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,338
[Gomez] But Isaac...

134
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,466
had his own plans in mind.

135
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:47,550
[Morticia] Hmm.

136
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:51,471
He thought he could use science to
extract Francoise's Hyde ability.

137
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:54,807
I had no idea that Isaac
was Pugsley's zombie

138
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,352
until I saw him
at Pilgrim World.

139
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,771
[Wednesday] He's not just
some brainless pet anymore.

140
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,773
Isaac has fully regenerated.

141
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:04,108
And he's reunited with
Francoise and Tyler.

142
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,612

town as promised.

[Morticia] Larissa told me it was you
snooping around here in Enid's body.

146
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,880
You and Weems have been
conspiring behind my back?

147
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:27,882
You went to Rotwood's grave.

148
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,926
It must have been
your grand mama

149
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,178
who planted that pernicious
idea in your head.

150
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:34,639
It may have been pernicious,
but it was enlightening.

151
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,392
How long have you been
writing, Barbara Jean?

152
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,940
[plants gurgling]

153
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,402
Since I was your age.

154
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:51,030
But I made the mistake of giving
my mother one of my early efforts.

155
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,698
The sound of her...

156
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:56,035
humiliating cackle
still haunts me.

157
00:08:56,118 --> 00:09:00,790
So, after that I decided to keep
my literary career a secret.

158
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,418
Your father has no inkling. That's
the way I'd like to keep it.

159
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:06,003
My lips are sealed
for my own protection.

160
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:09,423
I began to profusely vomit after
reading the first five pages.

161
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,262
Well, perhaps one day

162
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:19,434
you'll appreciate the intoxicating
power of weaving mystery and passion.

family matters at hand.

changed, Mother.

Enid no longer dies.

One of us does.

00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,830
Please. I... I've
been looking for you.

172
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:44,000
I've been avoiding you, which
I'll do for the rest of my life.

We decided to take a break
when I came to Nevermore.

175
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,427
I figured I'd join a new pack here.
I wanted to keep things casual.

176
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,179
[sighs softly] But
then I met someone.

177
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,391
I can't stop thinking about her.

178
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:01,976
I'm not going to
compete for you.

179
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:04,770
I know. So I finally broke
things off with her last night.

180
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,484
You've been keeping this
a secret all semester.

181
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,528
I don't know that I
can trust you again.

182
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:15,072
I'll do whatever it takes. Can
I still escort you to the gala?

183
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:19,535
Enid Sinclair, in
my classroom now!

184
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,415
You broke out of the Lupin
cages last night. Why?

185
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,960
Just wasn't really myself.

186
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,253
That's not an excuse.

187
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:33,800
Becoming an Alpha isn't
something you can take lightly.

188
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,594
Especially with a
full moon in two days.

189
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,388
That doesn't sound
ominous at all.

190
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:42,600
If a young Alpha transforms
under a full moon,

191
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:46,896
there's a very real chance you
could remain in your werewolf form.

192
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:48,898
For how long?

193
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,066
Wait.

194
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,153
You mean, like, forever?

195
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,572
I'm afraid it's worse.

196
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,157
Alphas who
permanently transform,

197
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,411
they're hunted and killed
by other werewolves.

198
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,538
It's a form of self-policing.

199
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,248
This is a living nightmare.

200
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,959
If you follow the precautions,
you should be fine.

201
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:12,213
Before sundown, lock yourself in
the Lupin cages and keep calm.

202
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:14,799
You're not alone in this, Enid.

203
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:17,552
Your pack is your strength.

204
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,637
[breathing shakily]

205
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,191
Leaving?

206
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,779
If you won't give me
permission to kill Wednesday,

207
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,531
we need to get the
hell out of Jericho.

208
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:41,743
The Addams family's not your
problem anymore, sweetie.

209
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,162
We have a bigger plan for them.

210
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,705
Leave it to your Uncle Isaac.

211
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,166
Because he's been
crushing it so far.

212
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:51,169
Every experiment has
unforeseen complications.

213
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,837
We'll be prepared next time.

214
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,840
There is no next time.
Your machine was destroyed.

215
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:58,426
It doesn't take a genius
to see that you failed.

216
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:01,054
The only thing that I care about

217
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,972
is saving my sister.

218
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,600
The one factor I don't need
in that equation is you.

219
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:08,603
Stop it. The minute we turn
on each other, we're dead.

220
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,146
One of us is already dead.

221
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,231
[Francoise coughing]

222
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,525
Francoise?

223
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:15,860
Her medicine, find it.

224
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:20,990
It's empty.

225
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,908
[somber, distraught
music playing]

226
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:26,328
I need some more.

227
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,165
[frustrated growl]

228
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:32,501
There's an animal hospital
in town. Come with me.

229
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,212
[Francoise coughing]

230
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,132
[morbidly intriguing
music playing]

231
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,107
Check in the back.

232
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,527
We're looking for anything that can
point us to where they're hiding.

233
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,654
Isaac isn't going anywhere until he
can save his sister from being a Hyde.

234
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:07,411
[delicately mysterious
music playing]

235
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,082
All Francoise ever
wanted was a normal life,

236
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,878
and she had it for
a fleeting moment.

237
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:25,012
The last time I stood in this room,
she asked me to be her maid of honor.

238
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,517
I knew she hadn't told
Galpin about her condition,

239
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,143
so I declined.

240
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,146
We didn't speak again.

241
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:37,233
Spare me your saccharine
stroll down memory lane.

242
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,902
Then perhaps you can tell
me how you plan to take on

243
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,447
the Galpin family
monster mash-up.

244
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,533
Your sharp tongue won't be
enough to keep them at bay.

245
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:48,786
If you're not here to help,
feel free to dissipate.

246
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,373
[music swells, trails off]

247
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,146
[suspenseful music playing]

248
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,616
For a couple of Hydes,
they fled like rats.

249
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:48,220
Now I understand why Isaac was so
hell-bent on saving his sister.

250
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,765
She's running out of time.

251
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,602
[delicate, foreboding
music playing]

252
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,364
[Eugene] A New
England corpse moth.

253
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:10,618
Extraordinary specimen.
Where'd you find it?

254
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:13,287
Following someone's
emotional support zombie.

255
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,580
You found Slurp?

256
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,544
Tweezed these from Slurp
when they were larvae.

257
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,629
Now they're about to enter
their migratory phase.

258
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:24,048
-What's that?
-When they return to their host body.

259
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,425
-To lay their eggs.
-What if the body's on the run?

260
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,427
[sighs] I bet they
can still find it.

261
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,013
Insect GPS beats Google
Maps every day of the week.

262
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,682
I just wanted a friend.

263
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,225
What, couldn't find
one with a pulse?

264
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:37,144
I tried, okay? But no
one was interested.

265
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,105
[melancholy music playing]

266
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:42,982
[sighs]

267
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,701
Go find your host.

268
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,869
[enigmatic, intriguing
music playing]

269
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:07,758
[faint police radio chatter]

270
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:09,802
Hey.

271
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:14,598
I saw this and went to go check on
your mom, but she's not in the room.

272
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,767
She was afraid
Gideon was onto her.

273
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:20,104
And now that the sheriff has
deputies crawling all over campus,

274
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,523
it was a matter of time
before she was discovered.

275
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:23,816
Wait, she left?

276
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,234
But where's she going?

277
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,443
I'm not sure.

278
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,946
She thought it was
better I didn't know.

279
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,573
It wouldn't be the first
time she's disappeared on me.

280
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,160
At least now you don't
have to worry about us.

281
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,829
Bianca. What's going on?

282
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,916
Ms. Barclay, can I
see you in my office?

283
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,714
Just drop it, okay?

284
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,842
It's better for
everyone this way.

285
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,346
[cryptic music playing]

286
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,434
[door opens]

287
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,019
[music trails off]

288
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:02,813
Grandmama?

289
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,192
I'm just biding my time
enjoying your novel.

290
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,903
Viper's mother, Dominica,
is pitch perfect.

291
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,905
How do you describe her?

292
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,615
"A clingy stay-at-home optimist

293
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,993
that makes Viper want to shed her
skin more times than a cobra."

294
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,786
[indulgent laughter]

295
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:21,791
Speaking of your mother, she
crystal balled me earlier.

296
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:25,127
Gave me an earful about steering
you to Professor Rotwood's grave.

297
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,629
Said there were complications.

298
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,673
I'm just relieved
that you're unscathed.

299
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,591
Neither of us have an
iota of compassion.

300
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:32,468
It's one of our most
endearing traits.

301
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,511
Tell me what really
brings you to Nevermore.

302
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,932
Your weasel of a principal
called last night.

303
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,810
I've heard kidnapping
victims sound less desperate.

304
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:44,188
He's offering me the moon to
donate to your mother's gala.

305
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:46,148
I thought that ship
had sailed, capsized,

306
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,109
and sunk to the bottom
of the Mariana Trench.

307
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:51,028
Of course it has. But
you know what I say...

308
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,907
The bigger the offer,
the sweeter the grovel.

309
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,493
You want to see the whites of
his eyes when you reject him.

310
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:01,288
There are few greater thrills
than witnessing the exact moment

311
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:03,540
when a man's spirit is broken.

312
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,752
Time to put Dort
out of his misery.

313
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:09,755
If he hasn't drowned in
his flop sweat already.

314
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,339
[Hester] Um...

315
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:15,469
Perhaps what you and your mother
need is a break from each other.

316
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,388
Come stay with me
for the summer.

317
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,640
I could teach you about
the family business.

318
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:23,227
I realize you're going to be
a literary <i>enfant terrible,</i>

319
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,853
but death is recession proof.

320
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:26,939
Thank you, Grandmama.

321
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:31,027
I knew you'd come under
my black wing eventually.

322
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,611
You may be an Addams,

323
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,613
but you're a Frump at heart.

324
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,865
What little heart you have.

325
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,120
Hester Frump,

326
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:45,082
it's an honor to have the
duchess of the dearly departed

327
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:47,543
haunt the halls of
Nevermore once again.

328
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:51,588
Savor it. I expect this
visit to be brief and final.

329
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,091
Then I won't waste
another second.

330
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,342
As I said on the phone,

331
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:58,220
your generosity will not
only ensure our future,

332
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:02,099
but will build a monument
to your life and work.

333
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:03,517
Introducing...

334
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,728
[grandiose fanfare trumpeting]

335
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:09,231
...the School of
Mortuary Sciences at...

336
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,358
Frump Tower.

337
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,488
Nevermore will be the
preeminent academy

338
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:19,075
for tomorrow's morticians,
embalmers, and funeral directors.

339
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,244
This will include updating
the campus cemetery

340
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,705
with Frump-branded headstones,

341
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:29,001
and replacing the
orchard with a body farm.

342
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:32,046
Death, Nevermore, and Frump.

343
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:35,216
-Can you think of a more unholy trinity?
-[Hester chuckles]

344
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,468
A masterful presentation.

345
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:40,512
My ego has never been
more expertly stroked.

346
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,766
But flattery is
like formaldehyde.

347
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,268
It is to be sniffed,
never swallowed.

348
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,938
Which is why I
have zero intention

349
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,774
of giving one cold cent
to this moth-eaten dump.

350
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:58,739
It was worth a shot.

351
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,532
[door opens]

352
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:05,579
Bianca, would you please
escort Ms. Frump to her car?

353
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:09,791
You will leave your entire
fortune to Nevermore.

354
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,502
That is your legacy.

355
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:14,505
You will present this decision
to your family and the world

356
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:16,215
without raising suspicion.

357
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,175
You will attend the gala
as the guest of honor.

358
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:19,385
[entrancing music playing]

359
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:23,222
And once I snap my fingers, you
won't remember I was ever here.

360
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,934
[entrancing music subsides]

361
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:28,936
[Hester exhales]

362
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:32,397
[door opens]

363
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,941
[door closes]

364
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,324
Hey, we need a vet!

365
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,826
Please, it's urgent!

366
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:49,498
-Sorry, I'm closing...
-It's an emergency. A car hit my dog.

367
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:52,251
-I can't move him by myself. Please.
-Where is he? Let's...

368
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,419
[vet grunts]

369
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,587
[chilling music playing]

370
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:02,135
[wet crunching]

371
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,435
You said she needs
a transfusion.

372
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:12,271
The pills they gave her at Willow
Hill suppressed her Hyde gene,

373
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,981
thus prolonging her life.

374
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:17,317
And when she
transformed to save you,

375
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,279
it must have exacerbated
her condition.

376
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,448
Are you saying this is my
fault? I'm killing her?

377
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,574
No.

378
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:26,118
But delaying her treatment will.

379
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:28,162
What your mother needs is blood.

380
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,663
Hyde blood.

381
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:30,831
Roll up your sleeve.

382
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,377
[chilling music subsides]

383
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,379
[elegant, lilting music rises]

384
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,548
[indistinct chatter]

385
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:58,317
I know you're here, Larissa.

386
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:02,404
[Weems] The gala will no
doubt be a rousing success.

387
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:05,616
Morticia Addams
will save Nevermore.

388
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:10,955
And the Larissa Weems era will
be buried once and for all.

389
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:14,667
It's never been my intention to
overshadow your achievements.

390
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,126
And yet,

391
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:19,212
it always ends up happening.

392
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,257
What has Wednesday done now?

393
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:25,135
It's not her this time.

394
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:32,142
Your mother is using your estrangement
to pull Wednesday closer to her.

395
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,729
I envied so much of
your life, Morticia.

396
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:38,023
But not your relationship
with that old bat.

397
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:41,527
-Thank you for saying so.
-[chuckles] Don't thank me yet.

398
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,362
You're more like your
mother than you think.

399
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:44,780
[scoffs]

400
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:47,616
I'm talking about your pathological
predilection for secrets.

401
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:50,244
Larissa, that's
completely unfair.

402
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:51,245
Is it?

403
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:54,373
You have failed to be
forthcoming with Wednesday

404
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:59,211
about your true relationship
with Francoise and Isaac.

405
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,047
Her vision has changed.

406
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,758
An Addams dies now.

407
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:09,722
Don't let this rip apart the family
you've spent your life trying to protect.

408
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,264
Tell her the truth

409
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,226
before tragedy strikes.

410
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:22,734
If I have to spend my nights in this
cage, I should make it feel like home.

411
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:27,865
-How goes the Hyde hunt?
-I put some feelers out.

412
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:31,201
They should be honing in on
Isaac's rotting flesh as we speak.

413
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:34,496
What's wrong, Enid?

414
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,126
Fun fact I learned today.

415
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:42,338
If a young Alpha wolfs
out on a full moon,

416
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:45,590
there's a high chance that
I could never change back.

417
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:50,012
Like ever. And if that isn't enough,
I'll be hunted by other werewolves.

418
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:53,557
The full moon is in two days. How
are you supposed to prevent that?

419
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,561
By staying calm. Trying to distract
myself with things that make me happy.

420
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:59,396
Like, picking a
dress for the gala.

421
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,690
For a gala you aren't
going to attend?

422
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,233
Bruno asked me.

423
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:04,902
As a friend.

424
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:07,488
Capri granted me an exception
for my dance routine,

425
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,281
as long as I lock up afterwards.

426
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:15,245
Capri said I didn't have to face
this Alpha business on my own.

427
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:17,164
That my strength is in my pack.

428
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:18,457
But the truth is...

429
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,084
[tender, emotional
music playing]

430
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,710
...you are my pack, Wednesday.

431
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:24,254
[inhales, exhales sharply]

432
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:29,009
If I wolfed out and couldn't,
you know, change back,

433
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,596
would you come and find me?

434
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:36,933
I have no problem
hunting you down.

435
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:39,645
[emotional music swells]

436
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,522
-[Enid] Ajax!
-Bianca's in trouble.

437
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:43,732
Have you heard of
Gideon Sterling?

438
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:48,195
I can't believe Bianca had a whole crime
drama going on and none of us knew!

439
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:49,488
Now her mom's missing.

440
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,031
I think that Dort's involved.

441
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:53,951
Sheriff Santiago and her deputies
are crawling all around the campus.

442
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,452
We have to tell someone!

443
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,623
Dort thinks we're in the dark.

444
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,626
I do my best work in the dark.

445
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:07,756
Wednesday.

446
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,174
Perfect timing.

447
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,219
Come look at my new tower.

448
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:16,849
Oh, that's just the tip of the
Frump philanthropic iceberg.

449
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:19,518
You said the only charity in
life was a quick, painless death.

450
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,854
Since my own family
has little interest

451
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:24,690
in the empire I've built
one grave at a time,

452
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:27,568
I've decided all my
spoils should be used

453
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:30,237
to educate future
generations of Outcasts.

454
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,698
Can you believe this
woman's generosity?

455
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:33,949
No.

456
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,033
I can't.

457
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:37,661
I'm still gonna inherit your
vintage car collection, right?

458
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,621
Not even a rusty
hubcap, my darling.

459
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:42,249
Our door has always been
open to you, Hester.

460
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:45,669
You're the one who boycotted our
wedding, and declined invitations

461
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:47,463
to all family gatherings.

462
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:51,299
I'm done with arguing about the
past. I only care about the future.

463
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,721
What Principal Dort and I have planned
will get Nevermore back on track.

464
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:59,933
Like barring Outcasts without
an ability from enrollment.

465
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:02,352
Like that inadequate
husband of yours.

466
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:05,105
Being an Outcast
is a state of mind.

467
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:08,692
No, dear. That's a platitude losers
say to make them feel like winners.

468
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:12,863
Let's just celebrate the fact
that Nevermore's future is secure.

469
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,698
Group selfie? [Dort chuckles]

470
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:19,536
[Dort] You, uh... Oh.

471
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,582
[Bianca grunting]

472
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:42,226
Wednesday. I thought you were
taking a break from the team.

473
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,602
Sabbatical's over.

474
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:46,021
[tense music pulsing]

475
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,564
[Bianca pants]

476
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,192
<i>En garde.</i>

477
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:04,081
-I've barely seen you all semester.
-We have different extracurriculars.

478
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,458
You do comas. I do a cappella.

479
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:07,626
And galas.

480
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,712
You've taken to those
like a Siren to water.

481
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,511
Your mother deserves
most of the credit.

482
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:21,223
Her attention to
detail is incredible.

483
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:24,267
-I enjoyed working with her.
-Speaking of mothers, how's yours?

484
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,312
Haven't seen her
since the summer.

485
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:29,995
You missed her when she was hiding
in that classroom off the quad?

486
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,988
I don't know what Ajax told
you, but stay out of it!

487
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:38,907
You've involved my family,
so that's an impossibility.

488
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:43,453
Dort is blackmailing you
and your mother, isn't he?

489
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:45,330
That's why you Siren-songed
my grandmother.

490
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:49,001
The four horsemen of the apocalypse would
have to gallop through her tombstones

491
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,211
before that woman gave
a cent to this school.

492
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:58,510
[music builds, steadies]

493
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:03,473
I thought I had freed my
mom from my stepfather.

494
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:07,394
But it turns out, Gideon
is just the front man.

495
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:10,480
And Dort is behind it all.

496
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,316
He was playing everyone
from the start.

497
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,779
He plans to steal your
grandmother's fortune.

498
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,741
You should have come to me.

499
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:24,494
Even Wednesday Addams
can't save me from this.

500
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:28,206
I'm sorry, but I had no choice.

501
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,292
And I still don't.

502
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:34,296
You won't remember this conversation,
or anything you know about my mother.

503
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:37,090
Nothing about the gala
is suspicious to you.

504
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:39,635
[emphatically] Let it go.

505
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,094
[entrancing melody playing]

506
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:42,262
[footsteps receding]

507
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:45,849
[Agnes laughs]

508
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:47,517
You called it perfectly.

509
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:51,020
-What'd she say?
-[Agnes] Exactly what you predicted.

510
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:55,859
Bianca confessed she's being blackmailed
by Dort and some guy named Gideon.

511
00:28:56,359 --> 00:29:00,614
-Then she Siren-songed me into forgetting.
-We really do make a great team, don't we?

512
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:02,282
Show yourself, Agnes.

513
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:03,575
[whoosh]

514
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:06,536
Now that your
premonition changed,

515
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:08,580
and Enid isn't dying,

516
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:11,666
I knew I had to step up my game
to become your best friend.

517
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,669

ordered Bianca Barclay
to Siren Morticia Addams

that I would split the money.

you hacked my Siren song,

just going through a phase.

me to reconsider,
