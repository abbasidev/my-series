00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,640
DINESH: So, as you can see,

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,881
since I became CEO,
our user growth, undeniable,

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,204
our retention, so sticky,
it's pornographic.

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,601
We're lean, we're exploding.

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,049
And we're more mission-focused than ever
in providing the best video chat

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,967
the world has ever seen.

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,531
Wow. Well, this seems
really promising, gentlemen.

8
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,762
Promising, indeed.

9
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,446
- I think if We just...
- "Promising"? (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

10
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,971
You're a young associate here,

11
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,565
so, I'm gonna help you out, okay?

12
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,804
We have a lot of these meetings set up.
We will be fine.

13
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,042
What he means by that is...

14
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,728
But you, you don't wanna be known around
here as the guy who fucked this up, okay?

15
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,087
So, when you hip your bosses to our numbers

16
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,204
and they get visible hard-ons,
have them move quickly.

17
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,447
Erlich, you're with me.

18
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,206
- It's "hards-on."
- What?

19
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,009
"Hards-on," not "hard-ons."

20
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,242
It's a syntactical error
that I could have remedied

21
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,084
if you'd just given me the space to speak.

22
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,367
Erlich. I'm seeing you Thursday, right?

23
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,567
You better believe it. I can't wait for it.

24
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,045
- For...
- For Jian-Yang's pitch.

25
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,122
His new idea sounds super exciting.

26
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,240
Yes, well, he is white-hot right now, and
that's why I had him reach out directly,

27
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,802
and we can't wait to pitch you the idea
that is gonna be pitched to you.

28
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,689
Great. I'll see you then.

29
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,644
- You have no idea what it is, do you?
- Not a fucking clue.

Always blue! Always blue! Always blue!

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,561
- Always blue! Always blue!
- (COMPUTER CHIMING)

34
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,444
Always blue. Always blue. Always blue...

35
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,284
- Hey.
- Always...

36
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,811
Richard? Hey.

37
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,602
What's... There you are. What's going on?
You celebrating something?

38
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,365
We were just chanting.

39
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,001
- Why? What, the pitches go well?
- They went fine, you could say.

40
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,320
You said they went awesome.

41
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:25,282
All right. Thank you, Big Head.
I mean, I did get us a few offers.

42
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,400
We did receive more than a few offers,
as few often refers to "three".

43
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,207
And today, we're four for four.

44
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,401
(CHUCKLES)

45
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,481
Huh.

46
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,963
- Which... I mean, what does that even mean?
- Nothing. Nothing at all.

47
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,484
(CHUCKLES) Look,
you don't have to do this, really.

48
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,016
It was my choice to leave the company,

49
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,523
and besides, my lnternet thing is going
great. Really, it's going very well.

50
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,922
So, lwant you to succeed,
and I want you guys to be happy.

51
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,451
Sure you do, slugger.

52
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,568
(SIGHS) Stop. Really.

53
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,201
- It's cool. I mean that totally honestly.
- Keep it positive.

54
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,929
Um, I should go skype my dad, I think,
and tell him the good news.

55
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,369
Um, it is good news, though, right?

56
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,205
'Cause we were all sort of,
like, happy and celebrating, but now...

57
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,416
Now, it feels sort of weird...

58
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,680
- Let's go, Big Head.
- Okay.

59
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,966
- It's good?
- Yes.

60
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,285
All right, well, enjoy. Carry on.
Always blue. (CHUCKLES)

61
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,251
- Jared.
- Okay.

62
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,136
- Always blue. Always blue...
- RICHARD: Sorry.

63
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,084
Dinesh, lthink
you accidentally disabled my access keys

64
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,969
for the video chat data repository.

65
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,807
No, actually, I deleted them on purpose.

66
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,130
I've purged all our ex-employees'.
Gleb, Sanjay, Elisabet, you...

67
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,601
Gleb? What, you're comparing me to Gleb?

68
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,120
When we agreed to split the company,

69
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,044
we said that you could take
the algorithm for your video chat,

70
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,136
and I could use
the data flowing through the system

71
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,811
to optimize the algorithm for my thing.
We had a deal.

72
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,680
We had an agreement, not
technically a deal.

73
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,366
What the fuck, Dinesh?

74
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,736
Play, play. Blue, blue.
Always blue, always blue.

75
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,736
Have fun, you're having a party.
You got pizza and everything.

76
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,761
Always blue...

77
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,136
So, what, I should've got it
in writing, Dinesh? ls that it?

78
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,321
You wanna lawyer-up now?

79
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,816
You know, we're just some guys in a house.

80
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,002
But I don't wanna be
just guys in a house, Richard.

81
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,687
That's the whole point.
I want PiperChat to be a real company.

82
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,047
And after all the bullshit we went through,
no offense,

83
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,806
I finally got some real financing
lined up for us.

84
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,803
I cannot have another
lntersite on my hands.

85
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,167
That was fucking Russ
and his shitty tequila.

86
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,096
You know that, man. You were there.
That wasn't me.

87
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,966
Richard, it happened on your watch.

88
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,522
I'm sorry. I really am.

89
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,444
But the answer is no.

90
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,046
Okay. Well, suck a dick.

91
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,288
I'm sorry. What did you say?

92
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,044
- Nice blazer.
- Thank you.

93
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,936
- Where'd you get it?
- DINESH: Does it matter?

94
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,530
Ijust wanna know where I can get one,

95
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,523
so I can look like a
total fucking douchebag.

96
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,966
Wow, right?

97
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,927
Unbelievable.

98
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,163
Gents, why don't we take
this party outside?

99
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,047
Yes. We live in California,
we should take advantage of it.

100
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,205
Gavin, you told me to interrupt
if Jack Barker came to see you. I'm sorry.

101
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,684
Yes. Send him in. I thought Barker
would crack after one day in that basement.

102
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,728
The fact that it's taken him two weeks

103
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,486
to fess up about hijacking my fucking plane
and resign,

104
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,841
will make it all the sweeter.

105
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,968
Hiya, Skipper. Sorry to barge in.
I owe you an apology.

106
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,082
Really? Whatever for?

107
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,125
When you stuck me in that basement,

108
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,370
I was like,
"Jack, what the hell did you do wrong?"

109
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,808
And I'm sorry that it took me so long
to get it through my thick skull.

110
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,247
I finally figured out
what this was all about.

111
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,163
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

112
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,966
You are doing exactly
what Bobby lger does over at Disney.

113
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,560
What?

114
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,242
He makes every manager spend
one day of the year in the Goofy suit.

115
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,244
Because sometimes,
you just gotta be at product level

116
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,209
to be able to see the best path forward.

117
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,649
And once I realized that, it was like,
ka-pow! "lt was so obvious."

118
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,485
It's the algorithm.

119
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,645
Pied Piper put middle-out in their vid
chat, and it's amazing now. I know.

120
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,563
I'm on that all the time with my grandkids.

121
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:32,124
We could use middle-out
to revamp our entire suite of products.

122
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,089
We can make billions, Chief.

123
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,401
I'm whipping up some proposals right now

124
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,721
that are gonna knock that wig
right off your head.

125
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,161
Yeah.

126
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,484
What the fuck is he up to?

127
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,085
Look like a fucking wig to you?

128
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,242
The point is, Jian-Yang,
you don't set pitches.

129
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,722
I handle the scheduling,
that's the symbiosis of our relationship.

130
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,326
- No.
- What do you mean, "No?"

131
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,601
No.

132
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,728
Jian-Yang, PiperChat has
some real heat, okay?

133
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,006
And we can draft off of that,

134
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,766
but it has to be
a carefully choreographed dance.

135
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,524
You can't just wiggle your little tush

136
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,762
and expect every VC in the Valley
to get hards-on.

137
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,566
I am your lead investor,
you will respect me as such.

138
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,290
I do not respect you.

139
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,285
You're not any kind of investor.
You own nothing.

140
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,044
I own 10%. You live in my incubator.

141
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,728
- No, you evict me, I evict your 10%.
- What are you talking about?

142
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:38,010
"Santa Clara Sheriff's Department.
Vacate or be forcibly removed."

143
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,768
To be fair, Jian-Yang, I filed this when I had
no expectation that the system would work.

144
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,128
- Okay.
- Jian-Yang, just tell me...

145
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,770
Can you just tell me what the idea is,

146
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,736
so I can gauge
how aggressively I should pursue it?

147
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:54,084
Hey, Jared, you were there, right?
When we split the company into two,

148
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,204
- Dinesh and I had a very...
- No, no. Stop, stop. Please stop, Richard.

149
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,441
- What?
- What are you doing?

150
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,168
What do you mean?
I'm complaining about Dinesh. He sucks.

151
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,325
- He's my boss now, Richard.
- Well, your boss is being a real prick.

152
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,404
Richard, we have to
bifurcate our relationship.

153
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,165
You and I can no longer discuss business.

154
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,961
All right? We can talk about anything else
two guys might talk about.

155
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:21,001
We can talk about
sports teams and their scores, or pussy.

156
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,766
But you and I cannot,
and will not discuss business.

157
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,690
(SIGHS)

158
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,845
Hey, man. For what it's worth, lthought
it was super fucked up, what Dinesh did.

159
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,923
I know what it's like to be the one guy
not in the company, you know?

160
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,361
So,

161
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,766
if you want my login, it's all yours.

162
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,321
Really?

163
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,731
- Yeah, man.
- Thanks.

164
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:53,808
(SIGHS) You know, I shouldn't do this.
Dinesh said no.

165
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,960
- And also, these are <i>Skyrim</i> cheat codes.
- Oh, shit. Yeah.

00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,369
I like it.

330
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,250
Hoover, you're the only person I can trust
at this goddamn company.

331
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,250
- It's good to have a friend.
- I understand that, sir.

332
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,241
Ah, Gavin, there you are.

333
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,291
Well, I don't want to interrupt
your talking with Hoover

334
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,124
and talking and talking about things.

335
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,046
- But I have some concrete news.
Regarding?

336
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,321
Jack Barker.

337
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,208
By foregoing western gadgetry,

338
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,841
simply stationing myself
in the hall outside of his office,

339
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:19,960
I was able to overhear him
speaking of his plans to move against you.

340
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:24,250
He even referred to you as "Gavin Smelson."

341
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,321
I knew it.

342
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,684
Good work, Denpok. Good work.

343
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,769
Let's go slice this bastard in half, yeah?

344
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,440
Hold on. We need proof.

345
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,411
Otherwise, he'll just deny it, and it'll
just be a case of "he said, she said."

346
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,131
Good point. Denpok, who was he talking to?

347
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,521
Oh, um...

348
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,403
Alas, I could not see this
from my hidden vantage point.

349
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,568
Hlcheckthelogs
and see who was in his office.

350
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,766
No, because...

351
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,365
No one was there.

352
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,009
I'm confused. Was he on the phone?

353
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,210
Yes. Very perceptive.

354
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,971
- Easy, I'll just pull up his phone records...
- No.

355
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,690
Not the "phone" phone.

356
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,241
So, what was he doing?
Was he video chatting?

357
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,926
That's what it was, chela.

358
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:16,443
- Even better, I'll pull up the chat data.
- You can do that?

359
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,488
Well, as long as he was on HooliChat.

360
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:23,088
But the bastard kept grinding in my face
how much he loved PiperChat.

361
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,722
- What if he was using...
- PiperChat!

362
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,801
- Yes.
- Fuck!

363
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,602
He said the resolution was
so vivid and superior to HooliChat.

364
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:37,006
Ah. Sadly, now,
we'll never know the identity of the person

365
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,607
with whom he was definitely talking.

366
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,123
- Unless...
- Unless what?

367
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,327
RICHARD: Dinesh?

368
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,205
Hey, man. How's it going?

369
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,845
Bad.

370
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,168
Well, look. I've been there, man.

371
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,811
- No, you haven't.
- Lhave.

372
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,046
One time when we were
pitching at Ross Lorna,

373
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,043
I threw up in my pants.
(CHUCKLES)

374
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,326
Don't you mean "on"?

375
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,121
Nope.

376
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,288
No, I mean "in."

377
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,647
We were pitching, and, well,
things weren't really going well.

378
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,846
I was getting nervous,

379
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,491
and, I don't know, lthink
I must've eaten something bad that day.

380
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:38,007
Anyway, my stomach was upside down,
so I made a beeline to the stall.

381
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,766
But then I pulled down my pants, sat down,

382
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,969
but instead of shit, I
threw up into my pants.

383
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,604
Well, lwas CEO for 11 days.

384
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,924
And in that time, I violated the
rights of 50,000 little girls,

385
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,446
exposed them to sexual predators,

386
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:02,570
and racked up fines
the size of a small nation's GDP.

387
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,369
Yeah. I threw up in my pants. (CHUCKLES)

388
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,526
Fuck.

389
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,291
What do I do, Richard?

390
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,443
- There are no right answers.
- (SIGHS)

391
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,285
You know, when lwas CEO,

392
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,922
I found that it was more about choosing the
one wrong answer that you can live with.

393
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,883
I really loved that video chat.

394
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,242
(PHONE BUZZING)

395
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,649
Hello?

396
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,085
This is he.

397
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,725
What?

398
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,936
(WHISPERS) It's Gavin Belson.

399
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,450
It's Gavin fucking Belson!

400
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,843
Hey. Gavin Belson. What's up?

401
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,367
Oh, my God, we're crushing it.
All the time.

402
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,761
I'm in a bathtub.

403
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,241
Yeah!

404
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,970
(CHUCKLES) Of course. I'd love to.

405
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,405
Bye.

406
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,000
He wants to meet me at Josephina's tonight.
Did I say yes?

407
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,481
(SCOFFS)

408
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,601
Holy shit.

409
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,690
Gavin Belson wants to acquire PiperChat.

410
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,651
He made the same call to me back when
he wanted to make an offer for Pied Piper.

411
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,645
He could take this entire shit-bomb
off Dinesh's hands?

412
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,006
Where's the fun in that?

413
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,004
More importantly, I could get
all my money back. Maybe even more.

414
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,730
We could 10X this motherfucker, gents.

415
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,848
- Although...
- Although what?

416
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:32,528
Well, I'm sorry to play the Cassandra again,
but Dinesh can't sell Gavin the company.

417
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,204
- Why not?
- Why the fuck not?

418
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,009
It's due diligence.

419
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,809
Gavin doesn't trust anyone.

420
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,803
When I worked for him,
he tried to microchip me.

421
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,491
Before he finalized any acquisition,

422
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,847
his legal team would uncover
our malfeasance.

423
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,207
They'd sniff out the
user issue immediately.

424
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,045
And they'd probably turn you in.
And you do not want that.

425
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,696
I mean, there's also the moral quandary.

426
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,883
Even if he could get away with it,
could Dinesh really sell the company

427
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,726
knowing it's basically a sizzler buffet
for the sexually deranged?

428
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,006
Of course he could.

429
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,651
Because even if there is
a 1% chance of success

430
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,042
and a 99% chance of failure, and prison,

431
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:10,446
he will do the right thing
and get me my money back.

432
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,171
I'm sorry, Erlich. I've made my decision.

433
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,848
I'm gonna say no to Gavin Belson,
shut it down, and just see what happens.

434
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,041
(YELLS) What the fuck? Huh?
What the fuck?

435
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,687
Jian-Yang!

436
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,322
Hey, Gavin. Well...

437
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:44,531
Dinesh. Thanks for coming.

438
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:50,724
Listen, Gavin. I've thought about it, and
if this is about you buying PiperChat...

439
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,928
I didn't come here today
to buy your company.

440
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,331
You didn't?

441
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,131
No. I came to take it.

442
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,929
I thought I'd have to buy you out,

443
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,256
and lwanted to know
what kind of CEO I'd be dealing with,

444
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,204
so, I had my comms people pull your press.

445
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:09,605
Like this interview you did with TechCrunch,
where you describe PiperChat as, and I quote,

446
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:15,449
"Exactly like HooliChat,
but without the suck-ass parts," end quote.

447
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,323
Or the one you did with Emily Chang
where you told her how you took

448
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,928
"the best parts of HooliChat
and made them less crappy."

449
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,601
I was about to throw you
a massive acquisition deal.

450
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:34,801
And then I realized you'd already
publicly admitted to stealing my IP.

451
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,370
I hope you have a good lawyer.

452
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,284
- He works at the car wash down the street.
- What?

453
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,850
Look, Gavin, you do not wanna do this.

454
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,770
- I can't explain exactly why...
- Shut up.

455
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,608
This is not a negotiation.

456
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:54,891
If you fight me, lwill win, and lwill
fuck you in the tech business forever.

457
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,964
No one will hire you. I'm taking PiperChat.

458
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,280
By 8:00 a.m. tomorrow,

459
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,931
you will hand over to Hooli
all your data and systems.

460
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,731
All your users
will be converted to HooliChat users.

461
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,962
It will be like PiperChat never existed.

462
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,565
And what you get out of it

463
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,008
is the chance to walk away
and try and get anotherjob in this town.

464
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,447
You have five seconds to decide.

465
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,091
- Five, four...
- Okay.

466
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,404
So, we're in agreement.

467
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,290
For a 10% stake in your current venture,

468
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,681
you will receive full pool privileges,

469
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:28,401
more room in the crisper,
and you may live in my home for...

470
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,607
- For free.
- For free for six months.

471
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,808
Fuck you. One year.

472
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:40,010
Fuck! Fine. Fine. It's a deal.

473
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,487
Deal.

474
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,642
Jian, I mean,
your onerous terms notwithstanding,

475
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,441
I'm very excited to be a
part of your VR play.

476
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,126
_IIVRII?
- VR, virtual reality.

477
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,407
- Who's doing VR?
- You are.

478
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,641
That's what Big Head said.

479
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,405
- This play has to do with the Oculus, right?
- No.

480
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,209
But he said that you said "Oculus."

481
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,886
He said you kept saying it,
"Oculus, Oculus, Oculus."

482
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,246
Octopus.

483
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,647
(SOFTLY) No.

484
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,321
No.

485
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,321
Octopus?

486
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,323
- It's a water animal.
- |...

487
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,563
I know what an octopus is. Just...

488
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,251
What does your application
have to do with octopus?

489
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:27,121
Eight different ways
to make a Chinese recipe octopus.

490
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,086
So, ljust traded one year of free rent,
full pool privileges,

491
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,288
and more room in the crisper

492
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:42,525
for an application that is just

493
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,283
eight recipes for octopus? Hmm?

494
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,641
Yes.

495
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,925
Hey, guys. They're ready.

496
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,723
- Ooh. Ooh.
- (KIDS LAUGHING)

497
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,044
What the fuck is this?

00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:04,330
I went through every chat in his history.
They're all the same.

499
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,768
Perhaps it was another chat format.

500
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,811
Could you acquire Skype or FaceTime
and check them as well?

501
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,880
- What?

502
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,082
Gavin? I'm sorry...

503
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,448
I need to talk to you about
this PiperChat acquisition.

504
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:22,969
I put together a panel of the most active
users you ported over from PiperChat.

505
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,963
Bear in mind, this group is representative

506
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:29,961
in terms of gender, race,
and most importantly, age.

507
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:34,568
Now, who else thinks changing to
a HooliChat login is hella lame?

508
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,330
Madison, Allison, Jennifer, Stephanie,
Quinn, Ingrid,

509
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,686
Kaylie, Ava, Sarah...

510
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,807
Oh, no.

511
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,962
Janelle, Carl.

512
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:50,926
Now, Carl, you said the new sign-in page
made you nervous.

513
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,965
Did anyone else feel nervous?

514
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,120
- GAVINI (POUNDING AND SHOUTING) Fuck!
