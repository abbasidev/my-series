No, but seriously, what

No, I am serious.

What, did you graze your penis
against a toilet seat?

- No. I had sex.
- Sex with what?

- Female.
- A female what?

9
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,487
A female human.

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,770

and we didn't use a condom.

Now listen, Richard,
I wouldn't worry so much.

We'll get your test back soon,

14

before then, but let's face it,

on that scale for a sec?

Okay. Why, am I gaining weight?

It's your unhealthy lifestyle, Richard.

To that end, we would like to clarify
our arrangement with you.

will be more than satisfactory.

This meeting is over.

00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,601
This is very generous,

46
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,601
but I was under the impression that, um,
I was going to be hired here.

47
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,604
And I've actually told quite a few people
that I was hired,

48
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,127
so if I wasn't,
then it would look like I was fired.

53

and in my earlier years, Chipotle
made by not hiring me.

54
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,444
All right. Don't hire me.

55
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,161

into 52 installments,

00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,322
You mean, a salary?

Those are your words, not mine.

59
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,165

60
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,404
You know, looking around at Bream-Hall,
I see a lot of the same.

Great catch. What's your point?

64
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,640
There is a grotesque gender imbalance
in the VC field right now.

65

I can help you navigate the toxicity
of this male culture,

which is encroaching on
our feminist island.

67
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,004
I mean, for instance, there's something
called mansplaining.

68
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,416
- Have you heard about this?
- We know what mansplaining is.

69
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,684
Mansplaining is when a man will
condescendingly explain something

70
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,081
to a woman that she already knows.

71
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,488

00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,328
Ugh. I mean, I'm still on hold.

341
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,287
It's like they don't even care
about small businesses.

342
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,727
Jared, they don't care about
small businesses.

343
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,768
That's why small businesses have to lie.

344
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,128
Like, um, Google named theirfirst building
"Building 40"

345
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,328
so that people would think
they were already huge.

346
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,890
When I worked at my first startup,

347
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,928
I would transfer people to "my supervisor"

348
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,890
and then I'd just get back
on the phone myself.

349
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,162
Oh. Uh, yeah, hello.

350
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,247
No, no. I'm not gonna go on hold again.

351
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,927
Um, in fact, could I transfer you
to my supervisor?

352
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,885
(CHUCKLES) Uh...

353
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,016
(WHISPERS) Oh, no, no, no.
I have to take a shit.

354
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,566
Just, um, do your best Ed Chen impression.

355
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,365
One moment please.

356
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,131
(IMITATING) What's up?
You've got Ed, uh, Chambers.

357
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,006
Hello, everybody. Thanks
again for making it.

358
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,287
And thanks to Gus of
Gigglybots for hosting.

359
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,360
No problem.

360
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,768
My name is, uh, Richard Hendricks, uh,
of Pied Piper.

361
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,524
You're the guys working for Gavin Belson.

362
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,411
Was working with Gavin Belson, yeah.

363
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,290
- So, he's not coming?
- No. No, not at all.

364
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,922
But I'll have you all know that without
any involvement from Gavin Belson,

365
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,722
Pied Piper, just like yourselves, has
reached the Hooli app store's top 500 list.

366
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:37,769
And you guys are aware that you are all
directly above us on the list,

367
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:43,051
which is why you should know that
a patent troll named Stewart Burke

368
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,170
has recently demanded that I pay
a $20,000 licensing fee.

369
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:52,326
And ifl pay, he's gonna come
and ask you guys for more money.

370
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,731
He starts With the little guy.

371
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,241
Not that I'm little. I'm, uh...

372
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,840
- I mean, I'm not.
- (CHAIR CLATTERING)

373
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,284
I'm actually, uh...

374
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,285
Above average height.

375
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,296
Isn't this something that could have been
done over e-mail?

376
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,446
RICHARD: I mean, lguess.

377
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,841
(SIGHS) But look, if we
don't stop this guy,

378
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,730
he's gonna just keep asking
for more and more money

379
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,451
until someone is stuck
with an unpayable bill.

380
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:20,047
It's kind of like that old fraternity game,
the limp biscuit.

381
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,562
Sorry, I wasn't in a fraternity.

382
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,640
Uh, what is that?

383
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,569
I don't think we need to get into...

384
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,486
It's where guys stand in a circle
and masturbate onto a cracker.

385
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,885
And then the last guy eats it.

386
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,761
What?

387
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,007
Again...

388
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,736
I don't really know
why he would mention that.

389
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,364
It's super gross.

390
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,488
Is this why Gavin Belson
stopped working with you?

391
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,561
RICHARD: N0.

392
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,087
The important thing is here,

393
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,960
my lawyer has actually drafted
a partnership agreement.

394
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,280
Why don't you all just...

395
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:59,810
Essentially, we all band together
and each contribute $20,000.

396
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,124
We should have more than enough money to
mount a challenge against this guy's patent.

397
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,248
And if we win, we dissolve the patent

398
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,687
so that he can't do this
to anyone else ever again.

399
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,721
Because in the end, shouldn't it be
Mr. Stewart Burke, the patent troll,

400
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,371
who's forced to eat the biscuit?

401
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,960
I'm pretty sure that's sexual assault.

402
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,923
Yeah, no one deserves that.

403
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,889
I know. That's not what I'm saying.

404
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,802
Look, I'm pretty sure it's even made up.

405
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,689
Like a donkey punch. You know?

406
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,411
Again, what is a donkey punch?

407
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,602
- It's when guys...
- Just don't.

408
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,281
Don't.

409
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,526

410

411
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,646
Very.

412
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:48,089
I'm about to set Anton loose on that
talking chrome beer coozy.

413
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:54,805
So, care to take a breather and help a pal
throw a basketball hoop on the old garage?

414
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,522
Why would you need help from a scrawny
code jockey such as myself?

415
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,090
Fine.

416
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,965
I'm perfectly capable of
figuring it out myself.

417
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,241
All I need is... Ah!

418
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,401
May I borrow this hammer to pound in these
flamboyant little nails?

419
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,010
Those are screws.

420
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,206
Yeah, no, I...

421
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,081

422
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,731
Yep, just a moment, please.
I'll transfer you.

423
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,611

keep you on hold long?

He's amazing.

436
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,123
- Who?
- Ed Chambers.

437
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,568
He got Pied Piper a great cloud
storage rate from Azure.

438
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,201
And he's got the hookup on a couple of
pallets of Pamplemousse LaCroix

439
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,363
at, his words, "an amaze-balls price."

00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,323
Wow. Good job, Jared.

441
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,324
Well, I mean, don't congratulate me.
Congratulate Ed Chambers.

442
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,370
- Ed Chambers is you.
- Well, lwish. But...

You all said that it couldn't be done,

Not-Short hath now slain the slimy troll.

447
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,565
I got word that you called.

448
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,247
I assume you spoke with my attorney,
Monsieur Ron Laflamme?

What, pray tell, did he tell you
when he called you?

451
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,931
<i>STEWART: Well, I called him actually,
to tell him</i>

452

<i>that the eight companies you apparently
tried to organize against me</i>

453

<i>have reached out to me
preemptively to settle.</i>

them a very, very reasonable rate.</i>

456
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,003
Okay. Uh, yeah.

457
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,281
Uh-huh.

458
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,451

Well, bye, then.

461
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,327
- So, your coalition fucked us?
- Yes.

462
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,562
So, now we have to pay the $20,000.

00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,200
Uh, not exactly.

464
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:16,485
Because he... Stu is saying
that since all eight companies

465
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,609
have now licensed the patent,
he has a stronger case against us.

466
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:23,207
So, um, he'd actually like more money.

467
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,090
- How much?
- $300,000.

so I'm gonna have to try something
with Anton.

00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,729

that's all.

But you're not seriously gonna defend
yourself in court, right?

Although he lost and was publicly beheaded.

486
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,322

in the court of history.

00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,485
Looks like I can slay
that troll, after all.

- (MARIACHl MUSIC PLAYING)
- STEWART: What am I looking at?

511
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:29,210
Well, you said that you used
Cancion <i>de</i> Amores to sue musicians.

512
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,362
You claimed that they
stole that song, right?

513
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,126
Bought two houses,
put Jeremy through four years of college.

514
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,407
Six. And he's still 20 credits short.

515
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,966
Okay. Well, he may want
to consider financial aid.

516
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:46,169
Um, because that little song there was
itself stolen from an old country song

517
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,848
called I'm Clyin', parentheses,
<i>With</i> My <i>Eyes</i> from 1967.

00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:54,481
A full eight years before
Cancion <i>de</i> Amores.

519
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,609
And I'm pretty sure Katrina and the Waves
would want to know

520
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,810
that they gave you a piece of
Walking on Sunshine for nothing.

521
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,168
Mazda may want to pull that whole
Super Bowl spot.

522
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,447
- Bullshit.
- No, no. Not bullshit.

524
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,769
Yeah, and we can take it to court
if you like, see who they believe.

00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:17,165
Perhaps the most advanced and sophisticated
pattern matching algorithm ever devised,

526
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,605
by a fucking genius.

527
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:23,288
Or some old asshole
who once sued Stevie Wonder.

528
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,286
All right.

529
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,050

I am a big prick.

Had to overclock Anton,

539
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,721
but I was able to brute-force
the backdoor password

to that chrome piece of shit

541
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,924
in under 12 hours.

542
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,889
And I added a little visual flair.

hook, line, and sinker.

548
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,482
Yeah, he thinks the
search results are real.

549
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,369
You trolled the troll.

550
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,536
(CHUCKLES) Yeah, yeah.
For a second there, he wasn't buying it,

551
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,370
and then ljust started babbling on
about tech specs,

552
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,726
and saw his eyes glaze over.

553
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:28,807
Well, as a result, we now have a perpetual,
royalty-free license for the patent.

554
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,046
Yés!

555
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,010
See? I stuck to my guns and as a result,

556
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,890
we now have 20 grand
we would have otherwise lost

557
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,282
if l'd have listened to you
delicate little snowflakes and settled.

558
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,291
Yeah? 20 grand.

559
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,363
Yeah? So, let me cum into a bucket
and have you all drink it.

560
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,601
Uh, Richard? Can I have a moment?

561
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,404
(SIGHS) Sorry about that. I regretted it
the second it came out of my mouth.

562
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,720
Richard.

563
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,484
Well, yes. But...

Here. (SIGHS)

565
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,967
What's this?

566
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,802
Um, that is a bill from Ron Laflamme

567
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,601
for the paperwork he had to do to put
your coalition of companies together.

568
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,081
- $22,000.
- Yeah.

569
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,322
It's at the high-end of standard.

570
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,404
So, it would have cost us slightly less
if we'd havejust...

571
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,925
Paid the troll?

572
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,402
Well, that's true,
but can you put a price on dignity?

573
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,446
Apparently, I just did.

574
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,726
Do me a favor and, uh, don't tell the guys.

575
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,280
Yeah. You have my utmost discretion.

576
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,606
- Thank you.
- Um, speaking of,

577
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,728
Richard, I need to tell you something.

578
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,404
I had to let Ed Chambers go.

579
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,766
Who?

580
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,410
My fictional supervisor.

581
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:43,565
He bragged to a sales rep at LaCroix
about doing it to Sonia Sotomayor.

582
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,722
So, Ed is no longer with us.

583
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,891
I'm sure we can manage.

584
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,809
He also was never actually with us.

585
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,976
- Right.
- 'Cause he was never real.

586

Out of sight, out of mind.

587
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,041
