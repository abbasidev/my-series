You only make that face
when your dick is on fire.

00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,000
- So, you're certain?
- Definitively.

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,964
The 36 Hooli phones that blew up at Hoolicon

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,165
and the 17 that blew up around
the US, all had our code on them.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,926
Richard, these are real people

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,731
with real crotches, and they're burning.

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,207
We have to tell someone. This was our fault.

10
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,441
No. No, no.

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,444
Keenan's demo was built to run
on a $10,000 rig.

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,285
Jack ported it to a phone in four days.

13
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,045
They wrote sloppy code
that's pinging the antenna constantly,

14
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,281
looking for the goggles.

15
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,887
That had to have caused
the phone's antenna to draw too much power.

16
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,247
Which would overheat the subpar battery.

17
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,522
And when we pinged
our network on top of all that...

19
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,242
Richard, what happened to being Honest Abe
from now on?

20
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,049
We committed a crime here.

Barely, Jared.

22
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,925
The fact that we hacked those phones
works in our favor.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,081
All of our code is hidden.

24
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,165
Agreed. And when Hooli launches
a new software update to fix the phones,

25
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,605
our network will still be functional,

26
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,288
Melcher will be happy, Monica will fund us,
and no one will ever know what we did.

- Yes, I'll know, too. But I'm okay with it.

- He's been out for months.

35
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,363
He left to go sell cocaine
at the Keystone pipeline protests.

36

- Don't beg, Richard.
-l'm not.

39
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,442
According to the employee handbook,
which you wrote,

40
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,081
an employee cannot leave
without giving two weeks' notice.

41
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,206
- You read the handbook?
- Yeah, I did.

42
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,966
All right, fine.
I'll fulfill my duties under protest.

43
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:14,126
But I will not do anything
illegal nor unethical, and lwill not lie.

44
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,921
I already have upwards of 50 burnt perinea
on my conscience, Richard.

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,403
That's enough.
Consider that my two weeks' notice.

46
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,727
All right, keep an eye on Hooli news,

47
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,963
and let me know
when Jack announces the HooliPhone update.

48
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,642
What do you mean
you're not issuing a software update?

49
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,367
Who can say why the phone
Gavin Belson brought to market

50
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,685
started exploding when we put
Keenan Feldspar's technology on it? Huh?

51
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,207
Is it Gavin's fault? ls it Keenan's fault?
ls it 50-50? Who knows?

52
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,328
We need to change the narrative here.

making the announcements at the gate

about Samsung Galaxy Note? being banned.

56
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,366

that our phones blow up airplanes,

57
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,683
no matter how much Gavin
and/or Keenan may have wanted it.

58
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,889
It's lethal PR.

59
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,928
We need to get ahead of this one,

60
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,609
which is why I am going to pull every last
affected Hooliphone out of circulation,

61
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,927
and replace it in the next three days.

62
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,810
That's over nine million devices.

to get our China plants
up to a capacity of two million per day,

65
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,008
and his negotiations with labor
were extremely delicate.

66
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,448
Well, China has never negotiated
with Jack Barker.

67
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:43,526
What you're proposing is staggeringly
expensive and borderline impossible.

68
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,687
We won't approve it.

to issue a press release

announcing the recall,
and it should be going out at...

73
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,086
Yeah, it's out.

74
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,646
- Jack.
- I tell you what.

75
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,411
Let's just gas up that Hooli jet,

76
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,690

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

78
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,085
So, every fucking Hooliphone that we're on
is being pulled out of service

79
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,487
and replaced with a new one
that doesn't have our code on it.

80

Half our storage capacity just gone.

81
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,690
Where the fuck are we gonna put
all of Melcher's data?

82
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,091
Wait. We have a server farm
in the garage, right?

83
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,288
Now, don't you think
ifAnton could have saved our ass,

84
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,566
I would have suggested it by now?

85
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,802
- Why can't it work?
- What are you, fucking stupid?

86
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,965
In order to hold that much data,
we would have to go RAID 0, no backup.

87
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,011
So, if we lose even one platter,
we lose Melcher's data permanently.

88
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,527
Plus, in Anton's present condition,
I'm afraid he might totally melt down.

89
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,285
- We have to call Melcher.
- No, we are not calling Melcher.

90
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,006
If we tell him about any of this,
that would be suicide.

that the company is in disarray,

there's a very simple explanation for that.

It is.

00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,726
I don't have an extra pair,
so I had to pull these out of a drawer.

146
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,407
I had 'em made for All Hallows' Eve.
I was a cat.

Yes, but Anton is overheating already.

I could get your Stanford login,

156
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,762
so I can access the faculty server array?

157
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,889
Oh, jeez. Uh...
I don't think I can do that, man.

Sure you can, man.

00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,724
and realized I don't really have one.

this real teacher sitting in, watching me.

They're not gonna notice
a few more measly petabytes, all right?

you are just a server company now,

503
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,966
and we intend to make servers obsolete.

504
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,203
So, I think perhaps in the end,

505
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,726
I will be the one devouring you.

506
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,084
I gave you that patent.

507
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,442
Thanks.

509
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,161
Fair enough, Richard.

510
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,603
I shall look forward to the fight.

511
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,688
Right back at you Gaby, baby.

512
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,361
Gavin.

513
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,967
Oh, um...

514
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,202
Did Erlich ever show up in Tibet?

515
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,761
No.

516
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,049
Jesus, what the hell did he order?

518
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,965
No, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, stop. Stop it.

519
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,084
No.DonT
