Uh, no. Um, you told me to name an idea,

That was my idea,

which, as it turns out,
he just signed over to me,

33
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,841

storage savings annually of 25%.

147
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:22,845
Wow. That's very impressive, all of it,
but you guys have to understand

that companies like ours

169
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,125
Yes, because of the technology
and because of our business proposal.

170
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:30,808
Look, can you just, please, for once,
keep your dick out of the equation?

171
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,166
I really wish I could,

172
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:36,171
but my dick is the abacus
upon which this equation

173
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,241
- will be...
- Guys.

174
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,526
This is our CTO.

175
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,966
ERLICH: Oh, great.

176
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,603
Oh. Oh.

177
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,126
Hello.

178
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,362
I'm Dan Melcher, nice to meet you.

179
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,766
Yeah. Hello.

180
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,491
Hi, Dan.

181
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,040
- Do you guys know each other?
- No.

182
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,284
Ijust said my name was Dan.
That's how he knows.

183
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,046
Uh, I don't need to waste
any more of your time with this.

184
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,248
Why don't I... I'll take
this one from here.

185
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,731
- Okay.
- Oh. Yeah.

186
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,246
What the fuck are you doing here?

187
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,004
Very rude, Daniel.

188
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,962
Although, what can we expect
after TechCrunch Disrupt

189
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,164
when you sucker punched me
in the goddamn face.

190
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,526
You fucked my wife.

191
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,444
I fucked your wives. Plural.

192
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,046
- Both of them.
- Erlich.

193
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,408
The customer's always right,
so let's just leave it at "wife," singular,

194
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,687
- and be done with it.
- Okay.

195
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,683
I need you to listen to me very carefully.

196
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,526
It took me a very long, long time
to get back on my feet

197
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,523
after I got fired from Oracle

198
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,931
and tech firms wouldn't touch me,

199
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,244
but I've managed to find
a home here, a life.

200
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,410
Okay, it's insurance.

201
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,723
It's not ideal, but it's something,

202
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,885
and I don't care, whatever it is
that you're selling here,

203
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,531
I'm not buying it.

204
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,656
Well, it's a pretty
groundbreaking technology.

205
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,489
- Oh. Shut the fuck up.
- Okay. Yeah.

206
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,968
Look at me, never gonna happen. Okay?

207
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,971
Never going to...

208
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,646
Dan, did you give the dogs
their medicine this morning?

209
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,611
Uh, no, was I supposed to?

210
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,776
Yeah, because remember, I had to go back
to the restaurant

211
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,245
to get your card that you forgot.

212
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,766
Uh, yep. Sorry.

213
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,048
Um, I mean, I guess I could run home.

214
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,726
- You two married?
- Oh. No, not yet. We're engaged. (CHUCKLES)

215
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,696
Well, it was nice to meet you both.

216
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,643
- Bye now, Liz.
- All right, bye, honey.

217
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,721
Okay.

218
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,045
ERLICHI Oh, Dan.

219
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,644
(INHALES DEEPLY)

220
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,085
Dan, Dan, Dan.

221
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,081
Dan Melcher,
the guy who beat the piss out of you?

222
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,526
The very same.

223
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,847
I looked him dead in the eyes and I said,

224
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,241
"Daniel, I fucked every
wife you've ever had.

225
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,606
"Care to go three for three?"

226
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,926
Needless to say, he did not.

227
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,323
You don't come off in that story
as well as you think you do.

228
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,571
So, to avoid being thrice made a cuckold,
he agreed to a deal?

229
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,166
Well, uh, not yet.

230
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,685
Melcher actually signed off on it,

231
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,162
but his fiancée wanted to certify
that what we're trying to build

232
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,816
complies with their data handling
and security protocols.

233
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,968
We're reviewing it all tomorrow, actually.

234
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,169
Ah, I can't wait.
Tomorrow, the real fun begins.

235
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,444
Uh, no. No, you're not coming.

236
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,730
- Why not?
- "Why not?" Uh... Geez.

237
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,082
Well, you fucked Dan's last wife

238
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,289
the night before he was ourjudge
on the TechCrunch panel

239
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,760
with absolutely no regard
for what that meant to the company.

240
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,804
What it meant for the company is that
we went to the finals and we won.

241
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,006
Because of the tech.

242
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,920
We won because of the tech, remember?

243
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,048
We're getting this deal
because of the tech.

244
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,680
I'm not letting you fuck this up, okay?

245
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,042
I know you're looking for something to do,
but this is not it.

246
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,936
What do you mean,
I'm looking for something to do?

247
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,096
You're lucky that you've garnished
this much of my time.

248
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,407
I have plenty to do.
Tons of lots of things.

249
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,970
I have a thriving incubator.

250
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,291
It is thriving.

251
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,131
Isn't it?

252
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,607
Fuck yOU, 9W5-

253
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,842
(CLEARS THROAT) Okay, so how soon
can we test our app on a phone?

254
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,882
Look, uh, about all this Erlich stuff...

255
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:33,010
Oh, no, no, no, I don't want to
talk about him or think about him

256
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,085
ever again. (CHUCKLES)

257
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,685
- Okay.
- Look, I've signed off.

258
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:42,126
But, Richard, I need you to look me in the
eye and tell me that this is gonna work,

259
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,528
'cause if it doesn't,
I'm completely fucked.

260
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,362
It's gonna work, I promise.

261
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,562
All right. Well, I'm gonna step out,
you're in good hands.

262
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,449
_0kay-
_Okay,

263
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,124
should we start with adjuster records?

264
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,247
Sure.

265
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,256
You guys said you were proficient
in video files, right?

266
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,203
We were a video chat company for a while.

267
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,406
Oh, that's exciting.

268
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,523
Uh, yeah, I guess.

269
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,131
It wasn't really for me.

270
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,449
Um, in fact, actually, just as
we were taking off, I walked away.

271
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,886
Commitment issues?

272
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,651
Uh, I don't know, it's just...

273
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,725
I never really thought that video chat
was the best use of our compression.

274
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,048
Kinda felt like I was settling, you know?

275
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,687
Ooh.

276
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,966
Settling.

277
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,170
RICHARD: Yeah, our company can grow in
ways that we haven't even thought of yet.

278
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,848
I mean, I was gonna spend the rest of my life
just wondering if there was something better.

279
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,656
That's not really a way to live. (CHUCKLES)

280
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,842
And what, I'm gonna say to all my friends,

281
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,167
like, "Oh, this is how I'm
spending my time," you know?

282
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,846
Every morning I get up and it's vidchat

283
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,536
and then I go to bed, it's vidchat,
then I get up again, it's vidchat,

284
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,403
and it's... lwanna kill myself, you know?

285
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,640
Yeah. Yeah, I think I know what you mean.

286
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,721
RICHARD: (CHUCKLES) Yeah.

287
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,600
MONICA: So, what do you think, Erlich?

288
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,330
You're the first person to see the place.

289
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,006
I love the smell of fresh spackle and hope.

290
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,921
Yeah? Two more weeks
and Bream-Hall's in business.

291
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,849
Even better, that donkey Ed Chen and Raviga
were so blindsided

292
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,216
they're running around
with their hair on fire.

293
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,765
Yeah, it's a beautiful world, Erlich.

294
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,491
And after years of busting my ass,
I'm finally doing it.

295
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,889
Oh! And check it out,
we even have swag with my name on it.

296
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,724
- Look, Monica Hall...
- Laufle.

297
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:20,286
Hello. Well, good. Now that you're both here,
we can dispense with the mindless chitchat.

298
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,170
I'd like to be the first
to offer you, both,

299
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,642
the opportunity to take me off the market.

300
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,646
I don't understand.

301
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,242
I'm saying that I very much respect
what you're doing here, almost revere it,

302
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,087
and I wanted to offer my services
as an associate

303
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,571
and I will not phone it in.

304
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,927
I'll be the first one here at 10:30 a.m.

305
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,407
And the last one to leave
a smidge after 4:00.

306
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,723
I'll, of course, need an office,
an attractive personal assistant,

307
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,802
paternity leave if that goes well,

308
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,647
and an umbrella insurance policy
if that does not go well.

309
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,246
What do you say?

310
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,525
I'd like ajob, dears.

311
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,082
The singular function of this firm

312
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,403
is to ensure that our investors' money
is in wise hands.

313
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,326
If you are known for anything,
it is quite the opposite.

314
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,846
Therefore, no.

315
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,886
(PHONE CLICKING)

316
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,161
I'm sorry, Erlich.

317
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,136
Look, I know you're looking
for something to do, but...

318
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,802
Who is pushing this false narrative
that I'm looking for something to do?

319
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,685
But... What?

320
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,685
But Laurie is my partner and if she doesn't
think you add any real value,

321
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,762
then there's no future for you here.

322
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,444
I gave you weed. A lot of it.

323
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,921
(SIGHS)

324
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,281
You want a fleece?

325
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,767
God, there's something beautiful about
testing your first alpha.

326
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,764
It's like watching a child
take its first steps.

327
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,970
Well, let's see if our space-saver app
actually saves us any space.

328
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,041
(SIGHS)

329
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,770
- All right. Done.
- (BEEPS)

330
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,521
Yeah?

331
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,123
Can I mark this deliverable as complete?

332
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,287
Is our child a dancer? (LAUGHS)

333
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,004
(CLICKING)

334
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:03,961
Wait, I was only using 32.2 gigs of data
before the test

335
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,805

mock me endlessly and without mercy,

a huge amount to gain.
