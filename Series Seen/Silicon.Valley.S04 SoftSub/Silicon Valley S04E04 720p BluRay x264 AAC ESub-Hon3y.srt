GAVIN: I was working through some issues.
Mind the glass.

What the fuck is this?

7
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,564
It's a license for your
peer-to-peer computer communication patent.

8
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,722
It's very standard stuff.

9
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,576
Uh, essentially, in
exchange for your patent,

10
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,731
you would get a royalty and equity
in the new company that I'm starting up.

by the Post-it note,

Come on. I wouldn't say that.

19
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,642
- Well, The Wall Street Journal said that.
- Oh.

20
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,768

because of something you did,

Really? You're a mean person, Richard.
You know that?

23
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,724
You're a bad guy.

24
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,649
No, no, no, no. lwouldn't say that.

25
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,802
I think maybe what's happening is that

26
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,641
you're just not understanding the
technology I'm trying to build here.

27
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,364
Oh, so, now I'm stupid, too?

28
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,769
I know what the technology is, Richard.
I have a patent on it.

you know that?

You're demented.

00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,536
I'm almost tempted to let you have a run at it,
just to watch you waste your fucking time.

35
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,370
This technology did not work
when Peter theorized it,

36
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,851
and it doesn't work now.

37
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,964

38
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,725
- It does.
- Oh, really?

When I exceeded the theoretical limit
of compression at TechCrunch.

41
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,056
- You were there.
- I know I was there,

42
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,890

that very painful memory.

43
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,970

- What?
- Draw on this?

46
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,324
Sure. Why not? It's
shattered, just like I am.

47
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,166
I read Peter's notes, all of them.

48
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,723
And, uh, he knew that a peer-to-peer
Internet was possible, in the future.

49
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,450
But he was also basing that
on what, old desktop computers?

50
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:52,086
He never, ever, foresaw the ubiquity or
power of all of our modern-day smartphones.

51
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,011
He was also dealing with
a completely different Weissman limit.

52
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,571
So, uh, yeah. Yeah, okay.

53
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,806
What is that?

54
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,405
Is that number correct?

55
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,602
The delta in mean device efficiency?

56
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,125
Yeah, it is.

57
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,403

that Hooli operates obsolete.

- That's part of the day, Richard.
- Okay, Gilfoyle.

148
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,569
I've been sleeping here at night,
and then I've been here for some mornings,

00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,041
but I've left the house during the day.

during the day, Richard.

Yeah, I went to the dispensary.

And then I'd smoked the weed
before I got home,

155
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,090
so I went back to the dispensary.

157
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,251

I haven't left the house in six days.

158
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,610
Now that's worth exploring.

174
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,370
When you don the skin of the beast,
the man within dies.

175
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,851
What is that, Nietzsche?

176
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,922
One of the boys at my group home
always said that.

177
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,081
He died.

178
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,889
You're not pulling Dinesh off SeeFood.

179
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,442
And I am not leaving SeeFood
to go work for Gavin fucking Belson.

180
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,766
I'm not asking you to.

181
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,607
You're not?

182
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,576
Guys, do you not remember
the last time we talked

183
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,046
about us all working with Gavin Belson?

184
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,449
Gilfoyle, you told me
to chortle your balls.

185
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,648
And everybody else walked out of the room.

186
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,489
I know how much you hate him,

187
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,762
which is exactly why I told Gavin
if we were gonna do this thing,

188
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,296
that you guys wouldn't be coming with.

189
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,087
So, we have hired a recruiter
to find people to replace you guys.

190
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,566
Even me?

191
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,725
Well, no.
You don't really need to be replaced.

192
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,729
It's true. I can't be replaced.

193
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:13,051
Well, when you left video chat, you did
keep the rights to the algorithm. So...

194
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,442
I mean, it's weird, but I guess
it's really none of our business.

195
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,170
It's my fucking business.

196
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,085
- I now own 10%...
- 5%, actually.

197
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,523
- What?
- 10% of my half of the company is 5%.

198
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,600
But I mean, look, your shares are gonna be
worth a whole lot more than they ever would,

199
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,723
now with the patent
and Gavin being involved, so...

200
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,968
So, then we're all good
here, I guess. Right?

201
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,451
I think that's right.

202
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,851
Weird.

203
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,008
All right. Well, thanks for understanding.

204
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,011
You're welcome.

205
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,842
I don't think we need to
be afraid of the Wi-Fi.

206
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,242
It's pronounced "Wifey,"
and clearly you don't understand

207
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,005
the threat level of the person
that you're sexually disappointing.

208
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,446
We're going hard wire.

209
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,921
What about my phone?

210
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,800
You mean the thing
that tracks your movement,

211
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,604
and every interaction you have?

212
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,170
Literally, your fingerprint?

213
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,562
The second you're on Wi-Fi it's like
you're leaving her alone with your phone.

214
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,480
So, actually leaving her
alone with my phone,

215
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,965
that would be bad?

216
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,885
You fucking idiot.

217
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,240
I was in the bathroom.

218
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,601
For how long?

219
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,766
Awhile.

220
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,481
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

221
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,000
Who's that?

222
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,449
Oh, Richard's meeting with Brett Saxby.

223
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,121
GILFOYLE: From Hooli?

224
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,283
Formerly. The recruiter sent him over.

225
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,562
He's interviewing him
for Head of Engineering.

226
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,882
Why? That guy sucks.

227
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,723
Why is Richard in there with Brett Saxby?

228
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,925
He was in Gavin's inner circle.

229
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,646
Is Richard aware of that?

230
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,691
Is anyone taking notes?
Does Richard even have a pen?

231
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,491
That's so funny.

232
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,490
It's 10:00 a.m.

233
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,245
Why are they drinking beer?

234
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,205
Because he sucks.

235
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,576
Did Dick say who else he was meeting with?

236
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,331
The recruiter sent him
like a whole big list right there.

237
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,441
Gonna be late for class.

238
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,641
How's that going?

239
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,846
Uh, it's okay.

240
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,366
I'm just a little nervous
I might run out of material soon.

241
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,810
We already watched the Facebook movie,
A.I., The <i>Net,</i> and half of <i>Tron.</i>

242
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,166
Which <i>Tron?</i>

243
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,805
<i>What? No, Tron.</i>

244
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,371
There's two Trons.

245
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,283
Oh, shit. That's awesome.

246
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,771
Should get me through another week.

247
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,967
Thanks!

248
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,487
This entire list is a
shitshow of shitheads.

249
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,531
Why would Richard trust a recruiter
to source him recruits?

250
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,563
- It doesn't make sense.
- Huh.

251
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,882
- What?
- You guys seem like super-invested

252
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,282
in who Richard hires
to work with Gavin Belson, that's all.

253
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,811
Are you insinuating jealousy?

254
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,886
- This is just concern for Richard's vision.
- Mmm-hmm.

255
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:03,841
If Richard wants to saddle himself
with mediocrity, go for it.

256
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,641
You did not.

257
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,566
- BRETT: I swear to God, bro. I swear to God.
- (LAUGHING)

258
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,361
Well, I tell you what. Next time you bust
out the old Sea-Doo, give me a call.

259
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,571
Uh, guys, you know Brett?

260
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,247
Nope.

261
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,440
It's great to meet you guys.

262
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,527
We've met.

263
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,086
Uh, okay. Well, it has been a pleasure.

264
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,847
I shall walk you to your car.

265
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,203
All right, after me.

266
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,520
- Yeah.
- Okay.

267
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,521
I hate him.

268
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,649
Gentlemen, ljust paid
the palapa contractor.

269
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,404
The palapa piper, so to speak.

270
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,840
The dream is a reality.

271
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,249
We will no longer be
exposed to the elements.

272
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,686
Hey, Erlich.

273
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,202
You wanna guess
who's on this list of availables

274
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,964
that Richard just got from his recruiter?

275
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,081
Who?

276
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,491
Your boy Jian-Yang.

277
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,806
- What?
- What?

278
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,770
Jian-Yang!

279
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,248
You already have a fucking job, Jian-Yang.
You have to finish SeeFood.

280
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,811
Now get to food scraping.

281
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,641
I fucking hate SeeFood.

282
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,524
I have to look at different hotdogs.

283
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,248
There's Chinese hotdogs,
Polish hotdogs, Jewish hotdogs.

284
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,560
It's fucking stupid.

285
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,968
Well, here, here's one more for ya.

286
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,886
See? Hotdog.
Doesn't even fucking work right.

287
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,088
You should hire someone
using company money,

288
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,083
not build a roof over nothing.

289
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,208
The palapa was budgeted for, Jian-Yang.

290
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,616
That's what you do when you get funding,

291
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,405
you upscale your workspace
to help with recruiting.

292
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,085
You just said you recruit no one.

293
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,856
Because we spent all the
money on upscaling.

294
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,689
Why is this so confusing?

295
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,921
You stealing.

296
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,562
If you can steal, I can quit.

297
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:46,164
I have meetings at Periscope, Airbnb,
good companies.

298
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,322
The fuck you do.

299
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,322
We still have $150,000
of Raviga's money left.

300
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,680
That's three months of burn.

301
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,082
So, 'til we are dick up and flat broke,
this is your life.

302
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,446
Get to it.

303
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,090
This is no life.

304
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,726
I want to live.

305
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,320
Erase that dick picture.

Those are very powerful words.</i>

309
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,169
- Sorry.
- No, it's okay.

310
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,887
Your phone has technology inside it.

311
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,566
So, you're double learning.

313
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,728
Jian-Yang, what in the good fuck is that?

314
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,849
It's called business expense.

315
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,490
You buy a hut.

316
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,321
I buy a car.

317
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,809
You say keep doing SeeFood
until money is gone.

318
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,844
Now, the money is gone.

319
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,246
Dick

320
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,006
is up.

321
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,680
Where'd you get those sunglasses,
did they come with the car?

322
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,811
These are from your mom.

323
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Listen, Jian-Yang.

324
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,240
You can'tjust blow the rest of our runway
on a Corvette.

325
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,856
- Who's gonna scrape the Internet?
- (MUSIC PLAYING)

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,326
What the fuck was that?

328
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,523
Oh, just three months of runway being
driven off by 90 pounds of asshole.

329
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,721
Spoken by a 280-pound pile of shit.

330
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,330
The fuck are you gonna do now?

331
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,361
Professor Bighetti, a word if you please?

332
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,211
Richard.

333
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,565
I know it's none of my business,

334
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,205
but I worked
with that Brett Saxby fellow at Hooli.

335
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,970
He's a talented engineer,

336
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,886
but in an office environment,
he can be both tardy and fresh.

337
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,090
Uh, I'm not hiring him.

338
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,571
He uses spaces, not tabs.

339
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,120
I see. Okay.

340
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,690
Well, that's a relief.

341
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,531
But, Richard,
what about the next Brett Saxby?

342
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,084
Or the Brett Saxby after that?

343
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,520
And even if you vet them all,
you are still in a room with Gavin.

344
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,688
So? We're partners. What's your point?

345
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:14,244
He and his posse of bandits and cutthroats
will turn on you in a second.

346
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,561
You need me.

347
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,931
The half-crazed, half-Apache
who will do anything to get your back.

348
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,411
I'll scalp Gavin ifl have to,

349
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,416
and all the rest of those
pale-faced sons of bitches.

350
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,647
I'll kill them with knives.
I'll kill them With guns.

351
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,246
I'll kill them with my hands.
I'll talk them into suicide.

352
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,367
It doesn't matter.

353
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,570
All right, Jared.
I think what you're asking is...

354
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,761
You want a job?

355
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,923
If you think you can find a place for me.

356
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,889
Yeah. Of course, Jared.

357
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,083
You're more than welcome to work on this.

358
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,881
(EXHALES)

359
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,089
Butjust to be clear,
you're not gonna stab anyone, are you?

360
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,005
(LAUGHING)

361
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,605
Oh, it feels good to laugh.

362
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,286
(SIGHS AND CHUCKLES)

363
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,449
So, that's a no, then?

364
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,445
(LAUGHING)

365
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,604
Richard.

366
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,126
So, we're not gonna finish the movie?

367
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,526
Yeah, sorry.

368
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,365
But my colleague here was pretty adamant

369
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:12,401
that a better use of class time might be
to learn while accomplishing something.

370
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,204
Now, take one, pass it all the way down.

371
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,011
We're supposed to scrape the Internet
for thousands of food images?

372
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:22,127
Yeah. So, you'll find like five,
or 30,000 pictures of your food.

373
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:26,365
And then put them in a folder
with that food's name on it.

374
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,042
And it's good if you get like,
weird angles or lighting of your food.

375
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,240
So, it should be pretty fun.

376
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,769
So, we're gathering training data
to run through a convolutional neural net.

377
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,480
Like an image classifier?

378
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,881
Who wants broccoli?

379
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,963
Broccolini, for the ladies? Broccoli.

380
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,802
Just so you know,
this does not mean I don't trust her.

381
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,482
I'm just doing this so you'll,
like, shut up and leave me alone.

382
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,289
Mia, if you're listening, you're so pretty.

383
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,170
Oh, you're both headed to Gavin's?

384
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,446
Indeed we are.

385
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,721
Together again.

386
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,320
Butch Cassidy
and his head of business development.

387
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,562
RICHARD: Oh, wow.
Another Western reference.

388
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,411
Yaw! (CHUCKLES)

389
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,250
Let's go.

390
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,965
You know, he'd hire you, too.

391
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,241
What?

392
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,840
All you have to do
is admit that you want the job.

393
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,486
And like, get down on your knees and beg.

394
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,685
Says the guy who's romancing a woman
through a phone that isn't even on.

395
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,370
A woman that he described to me in private
as a skinny little fuck factory.

396
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,366
Oh! N0, ldidn"t! God.

397
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,530
Mia, lwould never do that.

398
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,569
Richard, Brett Saxby
ran my data analytics team for three years.

399
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,961
Respectfully, I think passing on him
is a mistake.

400
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,046
Yes. Well, I met with
Brett Saxby and, um...

401
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,643
Uh... To be honest...

402
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,569
To be honest, I don't think he's our man.

403
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,286
Fair enough. There are
plenty of good alternatives on this list.

404
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,247
Although I'm a little confused
by your notes on some of these people.

405
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,681
"David Burnham.

406
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:08,842
"Annoying slob, fucked-up face, I could
write better Python with my asshole."

407
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,685
You know what, I think, you have my list.

408
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,082
Yes. I have a very weird shorthand.

409
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,967
Yeah.

410
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,330
Okay. Next.

411
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,249
Becca... No, guys. That
goes in the sun room.

412
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,001
I'll show you. All right. Back in a flash.

413
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,923
Come this way, gentlemen. Here.

414
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,720
God, there are pages of
graphic insults here.

415
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,286
Fucking Gilfoyle.

416
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,681
Right?

417
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,887
Richard, would you be open
to having Gilfoyle on the team?

418
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,206
Oh, yeah. Of course.

419
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,726
I mean, I'd hire him in a second,
but he'd never do it.

420
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,564
Richard, Gilfoyle is a
man of intense pride.

421
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:53,170
So, when he refers to a potential employee
as a "pig-faced fuck nose,"

422
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,928
what I hear is, "l need to be needed."

423
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,647
Well, what I hear is pig-faced fuck nose.

424
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,760
Exactly.

425
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,441
I mean, Gilfoyle's insults
are normally well-crafted, almost poetic.

426
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,726
Last week, he referred to me
as Frankenstein's bulimic daughter.

427
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,807
Yeah. I get what you mean. (SCOFFS)

428
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,281
So, what do you want me to do, Jared?
Beg him?

429
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,963
Well, I think a little outreach
would be in the company's best interest.

430
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,327
And really, "butt-dick"?

431
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,651
The man's in pain.

432
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:33,207
Hey, I know this system is super-confusing,
but we don't see any completed assignments.

433
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,288
Cut the shit. Where's the work?

434
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,887
Well, we all got to talking
the other day after class.

435
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,765
We couldn't figure out
if you were like a TA,

436
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,922
or why you were giving us assignments,

437
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,686
but we all agreed we didn't like the way that
you were speaking to Professor Bighetti.

438
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,926
I'm used to it.

439
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,289
So, we searched your name on PitchBook,

440
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,807
and that SeeFood app
you got funded at Raviga popped up.

441
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,042
PitchBook?
How do you have access to PitchBook?

442
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,088
Your idea was so simple,

443
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,776
it was like something you could come
up with in the room during a meeting.

444
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:07,567
Which is what Garrett from Coleman Blair
told us at the CS undergrad mixer on Friday.

445
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,286
Hey, Erlich. Here I am.

446
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,846
Class of '06.

447
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,446
Go Cardinal.

448
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,840
Go Cardinal.

449
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,326
Anyways, we founded our own
Shazam for food company,

450
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,641
- and he's funding us.
- Mmm-hmm.

451
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,564
- Congrats!
- Wait, that's stealing.

452
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,407
No, it's exactly what Mark Zuckerberg did

453
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,404
to the Winklevi in that Facebook movie
Professor Bighetti had us watch.

454
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,051
And he was the hero of that film.

455
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,970
And with all of us working together,
we'll easily beat you to market.

456
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,123
So, that's how it goes, huh? Hmm?

457
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,008
You steal a man's idea,
rendering his company worthless?

458
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,088
I've read a number of disparaging articles
about your generation in The Atlantic

459
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,685
and Slate.com summaries.

460
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,405
It's all true.

461
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,890
Trigger warning, fuck you.

462
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,729
Professor Bighetti, I'll see you at home.

463
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,925
You apologize?

464
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,441
In this case, yes, I apologize.

465
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,769
Who am I to advise you
on your very valuable company?

466
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,650
It's time to let you go, like a bird.

467
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,121
So, go out there, without me.

468
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,526
Make your recipe app.

469
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,171
Take your meetings.

470
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,647
Live.

471
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:18,760
That being said, since there's no cash
to buy me out, I propose this.

472
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:23,451
Allow me to keep the palapa,
and give me the 'vette.

473
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,926
You're cashing out?

474
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,763
Dinesh, stay out of this please.

475
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,843
Car and a hut for 10%.

476
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,320
It's a palapa.

477
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,931
Okay. It's a deal.

478
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,250
You know, the car was a mistake.

479
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,367
I was driving next to a store window.

480
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,411
And I stop and look in my reflection.

481
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,605
I look like an asshole.

482
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,123
Yes, I'm sure it was just the car.

483
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,726
A little piece of advice
regarding American culture.

484
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,123
A Corvette takes a certain sort of man
to be able to pull off.

485
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,565
Like a fedora.

486
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,325
Anyway. keys?

487
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:03,247
Oh, and now that I'm out of the company,
you'll need to tell Monica what transpired.

488
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,206
Thank you.

489
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:13,245
Gentlemen, I'm off to be
out and about in the 'vette.

490
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:18,645
Be back for supper, that is, of course, unless
I get fucked to death by the fairer sex.

491
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,328
Gilfoyle, Richard would like a moment,
if you don't mind.

492
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,885
You guys need me to go somewhere else?

493
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,805
No, it's fine. You can stay.
You can hear this. Uh...

494
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,523
Okay. Well, Gilfoyle,
I have reviewed the candidates

495
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,731
and it is very clear to me
that our company cannot succeed

496
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,726
without your unrivaled talents
as a systems architect.

497
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,962
So, would you please, please, please,
please come work for Pied Piper?

498
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,286
Thanks for asking.

499
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,364
I'm going to put this
as delicately as I know how.

500
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,530
You can chortle my balls.

501
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,326
Okay. Wow.

502
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,889
So, who do we want to run front-end dev?

503
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,571
"Cunt-ass" or "fuck-jerk"?

504
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,291
Listen.

505
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,202
This thing with Gavin
isn't gonna work without me.

506
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,602
So, because I feel bad for you, and because
I'd hate to see you fuck up good tech,

507
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,248
which will happen if I'm not there,
I'm willing to help you.

508
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,201
That's a beautiful gesture.

509
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,369
So, you're back aboard?

510
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,808
FYI, Becca Thorton is a cancerous prolapsed
anus of a human being,

511
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,202
but as a systems engineer,
she's not all bad.

512
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,407
Laufle?

513
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,410
Oh! Yes. Monica, come in.
Ljust heard the good news.

514
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,041
About...

515
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,442
Jian-Yang's nimble pivot.

516
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,604
Back away from the glass, please.

517
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,280
Special occasion!

518
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,841
He told me the whole story.

519
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,162
His interview at Periscope,

520
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,006
his discovery of the photo
of Bachman's genitals on his phone,

521
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,445
when demonstrating the app,

522
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,405
and his eureka moment.

523
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,643
When it turned out
that his "not hotdog" technology

524
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,564
outperformed Periscope's own technology.

525
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,080
He said all that?

526
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,841
Not quickly.

527
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,327
The eventual point, Jian-Yang

528
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,609
unwittingly crafted an amazing tool
for the real-time detection

529
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,927
and filtering of penile imagery.

530
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,967
I mean, Periscope does have a dick problem.

531
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,606
Monica. Ugh.

532
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,164
Jian-Yang went to Periscope for a job,

533
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,210
and walked out
with a $4 million acquisition offer.

534
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,847
Given our liquidation preference,
we have 10-X'd in two weeks.

535
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,849
So, hats off.

536
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,929
Well, thank you so much...

537
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,121
To Ed Chen for his shrewd call,
both to invest in this and make you lead.

538
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,881
He is quite astute.

539
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,008
Which is why
we've promoted him to senior partner.

540
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,481
Yeah.

541
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,800
(PHONE RINGING)

542
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,769
Monica, you've got Erlich.

543
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,565
I'm here with Jian-Yang and he just told me

544
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,328
that you traded 10% of the company
for a used car and a...

545
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,841
A hut.

546
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,246
<i>A hut?</i>

547
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,687
A palapa. And so what?

548
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,724
What do you mean
it's a half-a-million-dollar palapa?

549
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,207
<i>JIAN-YANG:
Erlich, is the refrigerator running?</i>

550
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,850
<i>It's Mike Hunt.</i>

551
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,491
<i>And he's rich.</i>

552
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,211
Shit!

553
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,011
Oh, hey, um,
when you begged Richard for the job,

554
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,204
did you actually, like,
literally lick his boots?

555
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,204
Or did you just go,
like, "Pretty please, Richard?

556
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,930
"Please, can I have ajob, Richard?"

557
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:50,409
Whatever I did, it was worth it
for the chance to work without you.

558
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,682
Speaking of, did your deal with Periscope
ever close?

559
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,881
Yep.

560
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,850
If I stay a year,
I vest a big chunk of Twitter stock.

561
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,731
- Great.
- DINESH: Great.

562
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,126
And what exactly are you working on?

563
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,803
Oh, you know, we're tuning our algorithm.

564
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,450
We're reconfiguring our

565
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,929
classifier from food to

566
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,720
another purpose.

567
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,601
Uh-huh.

568
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,403
In other words, you sit around
and look at dick pics all day long.

569
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,210
Don't let me stop you.

570
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,521
Wow.

571
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:34,565
I would say not safe for work,
but this is your work.

572
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,606
For a year.

573
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,811
At least.

574
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,445
Is that one

575
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,090
actually a hotdog?

576
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,761
Nope.

577
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,650
Not hotdog.

578
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,245
