and lwas getting bummed,

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,087

went kitesurfing in Fiji.

15
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,482
And I got a message that they agreed.

16
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,288
- So, you closed.
- Yep.

is going to be problematic.

so our server's gonna get cut off.

100

Point being, we could find another customer

101
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,130
and then use that upfront payment
to cover Melcher's fees.

102

we've already done that seven times.

with any of that,

and since you're his keyman,

116
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,241
maybe you could help set up
a data storage deal

and there was a barmaid.

right up to the barmaid,

00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,487
- KEENAN: Yeah.
- Okay. Perfect. That's great.

172
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,376
Um, well, I guess we should
get back to the house,

173
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,440
- draw up some paperwork for that.
- JARED: Mmm-hmm.

174
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,720
We should be able to
pull everything together by Monday?

175
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,010
Is it cool if we hang out

176
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,367
just to, like, play around
with the VR some more?

177
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,886
Okay, but I'm sure Keenan's busy.

178
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,485
No, you guys should stay.

179
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,483
You want a beer? ljust put in a fresh keg.

180
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,929
He put in a fresh keg.

181
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,206
It's so warm in here.

182
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,926
That would be the subfloor heating.
(LAUGHS)

183
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,685
I didn't even know I had it.
It just came with the house.

184
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,447
GILFOYLEI That's nice.

185
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,571
What are you telling me?
Box Two is delayed?

186
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,367
We were already facing some design
and production challenges,

187
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,044
but then this cold snap happened.

188
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,256
Apparently, there was frost
on the loading dock

189
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,009
at our microprocessor plant in Acton.

190
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,209
So, it's cold outside.

191
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,250
Why does everyone in this state
have to be such a wimp about it?

192
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,527
Well, a semi-truck slid
right through the door

193
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,524
and hit the main breaker panel
and melted down the entire facility.

194
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,921
The driver was incinerated instantly.

195
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,521
I see. Well, thoughts
and prayers, obviously.

196
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,450
But we'll still be ready to roll
out in time for Hoolicon, right?

197
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,370
Guys, hey, I'm not Gavin Belson. (CHUCKLES)

198
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,925
You can be honest with me.

199
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,490
How many days will this set us back?

200
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,606
We're going to miss delivery of product
by two quarters.

201
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,322
You realize Hoolicon is in one week, right?

202
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,803
I mean, it's my first Hoolicon
as CEO of this company.

203
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,642
I'm supposed to get up on stage

204
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,002
in front of an audience of thousands

205
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:37,041
and deliver a keynote presentation built
entirely around the release of Box Two.

206
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,802
I was going to descend
onto the stage in a giant box.

207
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,211
Boom!

208
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,520
Jack in the box.

209
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,043
Then Mike Tyson and Floyd Mayweather
were gonna come out and box

210
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,600
over who was gonna get to take home
the first new Box.

211
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,684
These are world-class puns!
Now, I got nothing.

212
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,521
Hello?

213
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,841
(LAUGHS) Hey, guys-

214
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,371
I have something to show you.

215
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,961
- Have you been here all weekend?
- Ls that the sushi guy?

216

(CHUCKLES) Matching pajamas.

217
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,680
You guys look like you're in a cult.

218
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,484
Oh. Keenan gets these for free.

219
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,696
Yeah, we're not gonna wear the same thing
three days straight.

220
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,920
You gotta come check this out.

221
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,681
This way.

222
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,210
(SIGHS)

223
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,801
Wow.

224
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,611
I didn't feel sick at all. Not once.

225
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,844
- Not even going up the hill?
- No.

226
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,971
No nausea at all.

227
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,565
Yeah, I felt fine the entire time.

228
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,771
What did you do, did you
reduce the latency?

229
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,849
I didn't. You did.

230
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,496
Dinesh and Gilfoyle helped me integrate

231
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,560
your middle-out
compression algorithm into my codec.

232
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,736
- L'm sorry, what?
- Lt's off the charts now, man.

233
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,696
We were even able to push
the barmaid to the cloud.

234
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,529
These two guys are mad geniuses.

235
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,960
Hang on, I have something for you.

236
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,240
Mmm-hmm.

237
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,681
What the fuck?

238
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,690
You just gave our proprietary technology
to this asshole

239
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,081
without even running it by me first.
Are you serious?

240
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,891
Well, we were just hanging out,
and he was like, "We should try it,"

241
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,736
and he said we could delete it,
and then he started getting really excited.

242
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,016
And then he said, you know,
"You're doing it," a bunch of times,

243
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,328
and then we did it,
and then we started getting really excited.

244
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,926
- And it was so exciting.
- And it worked.

245
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,445
The VR is rad now.

246
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,450
Gilfoyle, "rad"?

247
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,770
You are wearing
the exact same pajamas as Dinesh

248
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,285
and you're saying "rad" now?

249
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,360
You have been sucked entirely
into his little Keenan vortex.

250
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,441
Okay.

251
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,126
I grant you with (CLEARS THROAT)
the benefit of even a second's distance,

252
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,561
this isn't a good look.

253
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,449
I don't know. I think we look rad.

254
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,771
- Just hear Keenan out, okay?
- On what?

255
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,841
Here you go, Richard.

256
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,044

00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,886
was recalled five days before
Gavin Belson's Hoolicon keynote.

263
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,442
Now, if he can pull something together
that fast, certainly I can.

264
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,576
Well, sir, I really don't see the value
in you comparing yourself

265
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,806
so closely to Gavin Belson.

266
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,720
Meaning what, exactly?

267
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,606
Nothing. Just that

the tech world has ever seen.

<i>Anyone care to talk secure biometrics?</i>

291
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,128
Well, considering our looming debts
and the embryonic state of our network,

292
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,282
this is a very generous offer.

293
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,164
But we're not for sale, guys.

294
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,323
Richard, listen, it's like we've been
lost at sea for a long time

295
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,402
in a tiny boat and there is no wind,

296
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,450
and now, through sheer luck,

297
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,602
we've just happened
to drift right up to Hawaii.

298
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,528
Now, we can continue
sailing into the unknown

299
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,570
and probably sink,
or die of starvation, or scurvy,

300
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,166
or we can get off in Hawaii.

301
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,164
Let's get off in Hawaii.

302
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,560
What's so good about Hawaii?

303
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,443

- No.

00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,521
I think we should take it.

Okay, everything
Keenan touches turns to gold

307
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,965

How dare he put me in this position.

311

Everything just comes so easy to him.

312
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,976
He invents one little thing,
and then he's gonna make a billion dollars

313
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,526
and just, "Keenan Feldspar
gets whatever he wants,"

314
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,840

that says no to him. Great.

Richard, you are my captain,
and I'm your mate,

316
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,207
and I will sleep in the bilge with
the vermin and lwill eat hardtack,

317
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,281
and I will say thank you.

318
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,407
And if duty requires,
I will stand on deck and I will salute you

319

as we sink beneath the waves.

320
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:33,449
But as poor as our odds are, I'm worried
that if we turn down this offer,

321
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,920
we will lose the rest of our crew,

322
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,930

we will lose everything, Richard.

324
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,565

is really, really high.

333
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,561
Yes, but after crunching
the old numbies, um,

334
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,802
there's no way we could make
an acquisition work

335
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,080
for even just a penny less
than that number right there.

336
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,969
You know, what with the patent and the IP.

337
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,042
And you said it yourself,
my guys are the best.

338
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,290
So, Keenan, as you know,
the best is expensive.

339
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,011
This is more than ljust took in funding
from Bream-Hall,

340
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,810
and you want all cash.

00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,851
- I can't do that.
- Really?

342
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,202
Aw. Rats.

343
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,401
Rats, rats, rats.

344
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,687
(SIGHS)

345
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,761
Weird.

346
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,202
I wanted this to happen, but it didn't.

347
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,811
That sucks. lwanted it, too. Very badly.

348
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,281
But, you know what they say in life,

349
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,520
"You can't always get what you want."

350
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,006
This feeling sucks.

351
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,720
Trust me, you get used to it.

352
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,164
GILFOYLE: Wait, Keenan said no?

353
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,761
To us?

354
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,127
I guess you can never really know someone

355
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,567
until you ask them to put their money
where their mouth is.

356
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,126
Yeah, kind of a shitty thing to do.

357
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,004
Kind 0f a shitty little dude.

358
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,449
Anyway, lesson learned.

359
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,564
Anyhoo, as soon as Erlich comes in

360
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,368
and brings us our signed data storage
contract from Keenan, we'll be all set.

361
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,567
We'll be back in business.

362
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,211
Huh? Go team.

363
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,806
Let's celebrate. Let's, uh, put
on some music. We never do that.

364
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,921
What was the number?

365
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,008
- What number?
- Your counteroffer to Keenan,

366
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,880
what was the number
you went back to him with?

367
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,856
Gilfoyle, to be honest,
these deals are pretty complicated.

368
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,962
Richard, what was the number?

369
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,610
Twenty-five million fucking dollars.

370
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,764
- Wait, what?
- You heard the man-child right.

371
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,169
Richie had the quail eggs
to counter $25 million.

372
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,850
- Isn't that right, Richard?
- What?

373
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,331
That's fucking crazy.

374
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,010
Yeah, I thought so, too.

375
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,806
But you know what's even crazier than that?

376
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,726
You guys got yourself a fucking deal.

377
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,360
What?

378
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,601
(KEENAN LAUGHS)

379
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,126
Okay, so, this is $25 million?
This is real?

380
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,486
- As crystal.
- Yeah.

381
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,200
I'm not gonna lie,
when you first told me that number,

382
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,330
I had a feeling of mad.

383
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,849
But then I had lunch
and after that I was a little tired,

384
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,285
but I mostly felt pretty okay.

385
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:26,568
And that's when it hit me,
this is a guy who knows how valuable he is.

386
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,644
It got me to thinking that perhaps
I've undervalued my own company.

387
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,043
Especially because
now I have this baller algorithm

388
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,576
that's solving all my latency issues.

389
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,601
Well, my algorithm.

390
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,809
So, I called Big Cat here,
and we slid that new demo over to Raviga.

391
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,722
Ed Chen liked it so much he offered
to triple the Bream-Hall deal.

392
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,770
But the Bream-Hall deal is signed,
it's done, right?

393
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,121
Was done.

394
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,682
Enter the keyman, the Big Cat.

395
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,847
You see, if I quit Bream-Hall, then
Keenan is free to do whatever he wants.

396
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,604
You quit Bream-Hall?

397
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,800
Two hours ago.

398
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,049
Ten minutes later,
we were in a handshake deal at Raviga.

399
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,930
This adorable little wombat
made clear his intentions

400
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,243
that he wants me to be
the new COO of his company,

401
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,527
along with a 5% stake.

402
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,164
And now we can all work together
on this dope-ass shit

403
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,408
and make a fuck-ton of money
while we're doing it.

404
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,801
See, it always works out.

405
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,281
- It does. Who's drinking? To the palapa.
- Yeah.

406
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,765
Pour me one, Big Cat.

407
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,125
Jared, there's no pink glasses.

408
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,682
Richard, I know you think
I'm a bullshit artist.

409
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,042
It's okay. I totally am.

410
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,289
I have this gift where I can make people do
whatever I want them to do,

411
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,056
- and they don't even realize they're doing it.
- Right.

412
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,004
Richard, you have the greatest technology
that I've ever seen.

413
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,480
You could change the fucking world.

414
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,642
You just have to get
people excited about it.

415
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,721
That's where I come in.

416
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,361
You and me together, bro,
look how strong this is.

417
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,487
Fucking forget about it.

418
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,291
We're going to be fucking cutting class
and crushing ass.

419
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,243
You really think that you can
get people excited about Pied Piper?

420
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,801
Richard, that's what I do.

421
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,483
You know you're doing it. I can see it.

422
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,961
- He knows.
- Well...

423
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,576
- The wheels are already turning.
- Maybe.

424
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,040
Come on, you know you're fucking doing it.
Let's do it, buddy.

425
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,282
- Let's fucking do it. Come on.
- Okay. Yeah. Okay.

426
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,681
(ALL LAUGHING)

427
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,216
- All right, here you go.
- L'm just gonna wait.

428
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,288
- Okay. Here you are.
- Yeah.

429
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,771
KEENAN: Get out there.

430
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,401
(SIGHS)

431
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,811
- Richard...
- RICHARD: Yeah.

432
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,927
Are we okay?

433
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,162
Uh, no, Jared, we're not okay.

434
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,241
We're fucking rich.

435
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,163
(CHEERING)

436
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,607
Whoo!

437
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,808
Sorry, it's a bit nutty around here.

438
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,441
Yeah, (CLEARS THROAT)
well, ljust want to say

439
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,047
how sorry I am that Erlich
flaked on you guys.

440
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,567
Not your fault.

441
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,529
Also, and I know this might piss you off
to some degree...

442
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,411
I have decided to make a deal
with Keenan Feldspar.

443
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,126
What? Why?

444
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,090
He made a really good offer.

445
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,446
Lots of money.

446
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,688
And, look, he's got my back.

447
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,242
Right, well, it's not like him
to talk you into a deal

448
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,163
and then just totally fuck you over.

449
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,281
Yeah.

450
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,131
No, look, he's copped up to all that.

451
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,727
I mean, he was very honest
about the whole Keenan vortex thing, so...

452
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,776
Well, you don't think his
discussing the vortex

453
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,723
is just a way of pulling
you into the vortex?

454
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,083
No, why would he...

455
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,646
Son of a bitch.

456
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,121
Yeah.

457
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,082
Okay, look, Richard... (SIGHS)

458
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,768
What I'm about to tell you
is a huge breach of ethics,

459
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,491
but it's going to save you
from making a big mistake,

460
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,287
Keenan and Erlich's little keyman game

461
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,284
is the greatest thing
that happened to this firm.

462
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,806
I'd like to hear why.

463
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,889
A, no more Erlich.

464
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,765
And if that weren't enough,
we get our $20 million back.

465
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,763
But the biggest reason is that we realized

466
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,367
once we took a look under the hood,
Keenan's tech is dog shit.

467
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,768
No. No, it's not dog shit.

468
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,407
I thought so, too, but then I tried
the demo, and it's pretty amazing.

469
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,450
There's this point in the tavern
where you meet this barmaid

470
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,047
and you can look wherever you want
however long you want.

471
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,286
Yeah, well, um...

472
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,522
Look, the demo is amazing.

473
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,883
When you run it on a $10,000 rig.

474
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,088
But the future of VR is mobile,

475
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,136
and there's no phone on Earth
that could handle that demo,

476
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,924
let alone the full bloated platform.

477
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,004
Isn't that why Keenan has acquired us?

478
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,730
I mean, to help him figure that out?

479
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,802
No, he just wants you
to make the demo better

480
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,406
so he can take as much money
off the table as he can.

481
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,561
He'll walk away rich,

482
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,962
the company will crater,
and you will go down with it.

483
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,247
And that would be the end of Pied Piper.

484
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,689
Look, Richard, you have to tell Keenan
that you're not going to take this deal.

485
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,251
(SIGHS)

486
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,489
Fuck. What do I do?

487
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,531
How am I supposed to tell the guys
that I'm taking away their payday?

488
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,687
You don't understand.

489
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,760
Keenan had us pouring champagne
all over each other

490
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,291
like a bunch of fucking douchebags.

491
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,289
I honestly don't think they even care
that the tech is shit.

492
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,606
Theyjust wanna go to Hawaii.

493
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,686
- Hawaii?
- Lt's a metaphor we've been using.

494
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,085
Um, we are pirates and our ship is sinking,

495
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,564
and Keenan is Hawaii.

496
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,208
This is what you talk about all day?

497
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,843
Look, (CLEARS THROAT)
this deal was our only hope.

498
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,690
And with all due respect, uh,

499
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,409
you run your own firm and you're not exactly
jumping at the chance to fund us, are you?

500
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,403
Because you're still theoretical.

501
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,536
Look, I'll make you a promise.

502
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,324
If you can get all of Melcher's data

503
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,450
onto a stable network of mobile devices
and prove that this works,

504
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,449
- I will fund your A-round.
- Really?

505
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,806
You have my word.

506
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,162
But you have to tell Keenan, "No deal."

507
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,164
Uh, guys?

508
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,607
Oh, he came in the front this time.

509
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,040
(GILFOYLE CLEARS THROAT)

510
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,606
So, we need to talk to you.

511
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,604
You need to talk to me?

512
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,530
You may want to have a seat.

513
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,166
Okay.

516
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,482
Hey, Richard, there's some bad news.

517
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,365
Richard, right before
Keenan signed the Raviga deal,

518
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:45,367
somebody else swooped in and offered him
an absurd amount of money for his company.

519
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,251
And he took it.

520
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,527
Really?

521
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,084
So, Keenan sold his company?

522
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,921
Deal's off the table.

523
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,843
We're not going to Hawaii.

524
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,606
Oh.

525
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,446
No.

526
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,886
Oh.

527
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,480
No. (SIGHS)

528
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,123
Listen, Richard, we know you fought
really hard for this deal.

529
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,611
We will never forget that.

530
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:10,446
Yeah, I did. And lwould gladly fight for it
and you guys again.

531
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,046
Gosh. Damn.

532
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,810
Argh.

533
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,725
You don't seem that mad.

534
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,848
Iam. lam, Gilfoyle. I'm pissed.

535
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,924
If you need to kick another hole
in the door, we'd understand.

536

Yeah. No, I might have to.

537
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,406
Really. I just...

538
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,284
If I don't calm down, I will...

539
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,050
I will take you up on that.

540

Who, uh...

541
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,401
Who did he sell to?

542
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:39,884
The only other company that could
guarantee viable middle-out compression.

543
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,846
- Hooli.
- GILFOYLE: Yep.

544
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,570
Hooli? He sold to Hooli.

- GILFOYLE: Yeah.

547
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,442
I mean, that's not the half of it.

548
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,690
And once he figured out what
Erlich's 5% would be worth,

549
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,920
he left him out in the cold.

550
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,880
What, he got Erlich to quit his job,
and then cut him out of the deal?

551
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,089
- GILFOYLE: Mmm-hmm.
- Jesus.

552
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,607
We thought you were cursed, but maybe
it was just your proximity to Erlich.

553
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,688
I mean, that dude must have driven a van
over a bunch of gypsies in a previous life.

554
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,961
Where is he?

555
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,730
I saw him grab his lighter and bong

556
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,167
and head out to the palapa
to sulk a few minutes ago.

557
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,930
Isn't that his bong right there?

Hey, buddy.

564
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,651
Still not talking?

00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,561
You've been out here all night.
It's freezing.

Yeah, it was a nice palapa.

Well, the concrete's still pretty warm
from the fire.

570
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,720
He should be okay for at least
a few more hours.

571
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,207
Well, that's probably longer
than we'll be in business.
