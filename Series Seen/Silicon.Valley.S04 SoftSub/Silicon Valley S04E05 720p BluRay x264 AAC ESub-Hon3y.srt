00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,324
That was Peter's workstation.
This was mine.

Things sure have changed, but in a
way, they've stayed exactly the same.

As we forge our new path together,

7
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,891
we must remain focused
on what's really important.

Yeah, Frank is the fucking best.
He does all my buildings.

Okay, guys? We're all set up. Shall we?

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,644
Yes. Let's do it. Of course.

RICHARD: All right, so in building this
peer-to-peer Internet,

24
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,526
the paradox that we're up against
is that people won't want to participate

25
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,284
until the quality is high,

26
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,922
and the quality won't be high until, um...

27
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,720
And the quality won't be high until we have
a lot of people opt into the network.

28
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,686
So, that presents a little bit of

Very discreet.

00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,251
Keep going. This is great.

- No, of course not.

Well, the science
is actually pretty fascinating.

Regular transfusions of the blood of
a younger, physically fit donor

00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,601
can significantly retard the aging process,

49
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,688
and Bryce is a picture of health.
Just look at him.

50
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,248

No, she... No, no. Mmm-mmm.

FYI, Monica, my invite
must have gotten lost in the e-mail,

00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,205

to have me as his plus one.

I thought he retired.

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,964
He's still on the board.

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,489
What would a co-founder of Raviga
be doing at a baby shower?

00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,085
How often is he even in the building?

00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,321
Like once a year.

72
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,165
Ed Chen threw this whole thing
just to suck up to Laurie.

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,766
Monica, this is not a baby shower.
This is a coup.

00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,330
What are you talking about?

75
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,485
Ed Chen didn't throw this party
to impress Laurie.

76
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,090
He threw it to oust her

00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,006

who think that pregnancy is a weakness,

her responsibilities at Raviga.

are bro'ing down.

Jian-Yang, are you drinking creamer?

91
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,645
It's a half-half.

92
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,969
Which brings us to our
one final, crucial question.

93
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,691
What value can we offer now to the user

94
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,048
to entice them to download the app
and opt into our network?

95
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,571
And the answer is,

96
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,841
the brand-new Pied Piper app.

97
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,720
The app will take all of the data
on a person's phone and compress it,

98
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,643
freeing up 20% more storage.

99
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,121
They can have half of that free memory

100
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:21,081
while we will take the other half, walled
off on their phone, for our own future use.

101
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,401
It's a win-win.

102
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,961
Hmm. That's very well thought out.

103
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,246
Well done, gentlemen.

104
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,211
So, when do we announce?

105
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,731
Announce what?

106
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,241
Richard, when I do something, it's news.

107
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,084
Don't you think you want to lean into that?

108
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:41,123
We'll announce, rack up huge user interest,
and then do a massive public launch at scale.

109
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,401
RICHARD: Uh, n0.

110
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,848
We planned this under the assumption
that we'll be rolling out quietly

111
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,651
and not really talking about
our ultimate intentions.

112
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,367
Besides, rolling out at scale
is a completely different model

113
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,171
with vastly different technical
and business challenges,

114
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,496
and we're not prepared for that.

115
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,967
And I think we'd all agree that a stealth
roll-out would be best for this one.

Mmm... (INHALES SHARPLY)

Uh... Well, you know,
itjust seems like a missed opportunity.

119
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,164
I mean, shouldn't you figure out
how a big launch would work

120
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,970
before you just say no to it?

121
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,281
Hmm.

122
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,081
Or not.

123
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,566
You know, it's not my company.

124
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,801
That is so true.

125

Bryce makes a good point.

your little ideas to yourself?

that a stealth roll-out was the best idea.

Uh... Yeah, well, I...

149

sound like the way to go to me.

151
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,605
BRYCE: I mean, Gavin has obviously had
a lot more success than you, Richard,

152
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,809
and ljust think having an asset
like Gavin Belson on your side...

00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,124
- That's real?
- Yeah, he's real.

173
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,247
Real mouthy.

174
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,641
And he's sticking
his perfectly symmetrical face

175
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,563
into actual smart people's business.

176
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,371
I mean, that Ken doll probably thinks
traversing a binary search tree

177
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,647
runs in the order of n instead of login.

178
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,721
(SNIGGERS) Idiot.

179
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,245
Jared called him a dick.

180
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,561
Seriously? To his face? No.

181
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,802
- Yeah.
- DINESH: That sounds awesome.

182
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,804
But it's probably nothing compared
to the thousands upon thousands

183
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,365
of gnarled male genitals

184
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,602
that you get to see every day at yourjob.

185
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,284
- (SOFTLY) Fuck.
- (DOOR OPENS)

186
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,845
_l_ley!
- Hi!

187
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,446
- I brought you some dinner, Neshi.
- Thank you.

188
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,561
Neshi?

189
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,364
Shut the fuck up, Gilfoyle.

190
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,207
You just missed these idiots telling me
how hard they're selling out

191
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:06,808
by working for fucking Gavin Belson
in his disgusting lap of luxury.

192
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,451
Seriously, how can you work
for that asshole?

193
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,887
My man, the Gavin Killer,

194
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,247
would never compromise
his principles for money.

195
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,407
Oh, no?

196
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,204
No, he would not,

197
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,328
and he is busy doing the rewarding work

198
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,325
of keeping the Internet free
of graphic sexual imagery.

199
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,041
Hey, can we eat later?

200
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,721
Of course.

201
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,736
I'm gonna go put this in the fridge.

202
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,047
Okay, yeah, thank you.

203
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:37,047
Hey, you actually still haven't told her
that your takedown of Gavin Belson

204
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,202
- was an accident?
- Shh! lt hasn't come up.

205
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,362
We were just talking about him with her,

206
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,656
- so it did come up.
- (PHONE RINGS)

207
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,762
- Gavin, hello. What's going on?
- Hey, could you...

208
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,571
<i>GAVIN: Richard, did you and a member
of your team verbally assault</i>

209
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,608
my transfusion associate?

210
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,968
Do you have any idea what that kind of
stress could do to his cortisol levels

211
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,884
<i>and therefore my cortisol levels?</i>

212
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,007
Yeah.

213
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,404
Well, he's not technically in the company
and he kind ofjust butted in, so...

214
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,848
ls your ego so fragile that
if someone disagrees with you,

215
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,445
you have to demean them?

216
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,286
I want you to go and apologize
to Bryce immediately.

217
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,691
Why should I apologize?

218
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,287
Why should I be in business with someone who
treats support staff with such contempt?

219
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,960
You can tell a lot about a person's character
by how they treat the little people, Richard.

220
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,809
I bet you're mean to waiters, too.

221
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,651
(SCOFFS) What? No. I'm awesome to waiters.

222
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,530
Well, then I suggest
you be awesome to Bryce, too.

223
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,802
<i>His blood is flowing
through my veins, Richard.</i>

224
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,484
<i>Make this right.</i>

225
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,561
(LINE DISCONNECTS)

226
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,170
Fucking blood boy.

227
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,001
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

228
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,326
What do you want, Richard?

229
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:44,361
Bryce, lwanted to swing by
and apologize for yelling at you

230
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,091
when you offered your
very unsolicited opinion.

231
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,402
Also, on behalf of Jared,

232
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,161
we mean no disrespect
to you or your career choice. Okay?

233
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,731
My career choice?

234
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,048
You think that I moved out here
to be a blood boy?

235
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,009
Did you know I have a degree in CS?

236
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,161
- You do?
- Yeah.

237
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,760
But you probably thought that
lwasjust, you know, some dumbjock.

238
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,847
Well that's typical,

239
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,843
because people who look like me,

240
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,400
we never get taken seriously
in the tech business

241
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,931
by people who look like you.

242
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,081
You're biased.

243
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,248
Well, hang on. I am not biased, okay?

244
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,170
Come on. Hey, the whole business is biased.

245
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,176
I mean, that's the only way
that a good-looking guy like me

246
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,850
can get in a room with Gavin Belson

247
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,207
is by being a blood boy, and that sucks.

248
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,328
I gotta work out constantly.

249
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,536
I can't have a beer with my friends,
I can't eatjunk food.

250
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,280
Do you know that Gavin
made me go full vege?

251
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,561
I mean, fuck soy, man!

252
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,446
But to people like you,
I'm just a beautiful bag of blood.

253
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,646
But you know what?

254
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,611
I got some pretty good fucking ideas,
and Gavin actually listens to those ideas.

255
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,843
It took a while, but he respects me
and you know what, Richard Hendricks?

256
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,924
You clearly fucking don't. So, good night.

257
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,608
Hey, look, it's Osama Bin Fuckin'.

258
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,569
I thought you were staying
at Mia's tonight?

259
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,723
I was going to,
but alas, I had some intestinal distress,

260
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,040
so I couldn't stay,

261
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,884
which really sucks because she's so great,

262
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,567
which really is horrible because it's so hard
to be away from her because she's so great.

263
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,244
Can l...

264
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,971
I have no diarrhea. I lied.

265
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:13,642
I am so fucked. This girl is
gonna kill me or get me killed.

266
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,321
Do tell.

267
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,607
So, she's super attractive,
and she's super smart,

268
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,886
and she's way into me,

269
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,281
like way more than
a normal person should be, and sex...

270
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,410
There's so much sex.
The problem is the part after.

271
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,403
- When you have to apologize?
- No.

272
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,171
When we do pillow-talk.

273
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,802
Well, that's the best part.
Everything before that's just foreplay.

274
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,927
Not with her.

275
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,446
She'll tell me how cute
I am and how into me she is,

276
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,648
and how she hacked
into Bowman Avenue Dam.

277
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,656
That was the Iranian Revolutionary Guard
that was...

278
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,682
No! It was her. She pinned it on them.

279
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,283
She flooded an area being surveyed
for hotel construction.

280
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,682
Just to confirm,
honesty is off the table, right?

281
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,890
Because it seems like the longer you wait,
the worse it's gonna get.

282
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,162
I'm with Jared. You should wait.

283
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,931
I have to end it. Right now.

284
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,201
First thing Monday.

285
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,124
Well, Saturday is her sister's wedding
and then Sunday...

286
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,320
You know, Sundays are just for me.
You guys know that.

287
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,603
Wait, her sister's wedding?
That's what you should be afraid of.

288
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,761
VVhy?

289
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,411
GILFOYLE: That's the threshold
that you don't want to cross.

290
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:19,845
I mean, weddings are very public events
with photographers taking pictures of you,

291
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,445
- indelibly tied to her.
- (DOOR OPENS)

292
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,364
I mean, those are forever photos.

293
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,606
- Forever.
- (DOOR SHUTS)

294
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,688
Fuck.

295
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,086
Hey. guys. Um...

296
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,125
I'm trying to find Erlich. ls he "holding?"

297
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,530
I'm afraid you caught me
at an inopportune time.

298
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,845
I'm long overdue to a trip
to my dispensary, so I don't have much,

299
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,084
but I have Bubba Kush,
Chocolate Thunder, Barbara Bush,

300
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,004
Barbara Streisand, Barbara Bush Junior...

301
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,486
Yeah, this is plenty.

302
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,251
No, no, that's actually for my astigmatism.

303
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,845
- Okay.
- Tut-tut-tut-tut.

304
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,686
This is in case of emergency only.
I'll need it if an earthquake occurs.

305
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:03,084
Okay, just give me whatever. I don't care.
It's not for me. It's for Ed Chen.

306
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,002
What are you up to, clever girl?

307
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,003
(SIGHS) Well, I took your advice.

308
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:12,961
It wasn't pretty,
but I bro'd down with him pretty hard.

309
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,163
I mean, lthink I did. To be honest,
I was kind of all over the map.

310
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,402
I shot-gunned a warm beer

311
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,364
and then I acted all blown away

312
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,091
when he showed me 40 minutes
of snowboarding videos

313
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,447
set to Diplo remixes.

314
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,921
Good on you.

315
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,965
But it worked. I'm in.

316
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,647
Ed copped to everything and said that
as long as I don't say anything to Laurie,

317
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,006
I have a seat at the table.

318
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,281
Huh.

319
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,170
Wait, did he say that?
Those were his exact words?

320
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,527
You'll have a seat if
you don't tell Laurie?

321
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,811
Yeah. So?

322
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,605
- Oh, dear, that does not bode well for you.
- What do you mean?

323
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,004
Well, if Ed Chen is afraid of you
saying anything to Laurie,

324
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,122
then that means that
the deal isn't solidified yet.

325
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,408
He doesn't have the votes.

326
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,284
Unfortunately for you, that would mean

327
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,170
you may have put your money
on the wrong horse.

328
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:07,042
So, you mean Laurie still has a chance
to survive this coup?

329
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,371
Well, then why did you say
I should bro down with Ed Chen?

330
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,401
I say a lot of things, Monica.

331
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,921
I say a lot of things.

332
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,401
DINESHI Um...

333
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,881
I know you'd think
I'm sort of crusading badass

334
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,851
who built a ticking time bomb
and slipped it to Gavin Belson

335
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,367
to bring him down
as retribution for his wrongdoings,

336
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,648
but the truth is,

337
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,161
because of my gross incompetence

338
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,928
during my brief and utterly disgraceful
tenure as PiperChat's CEO,

339
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:52,248
I incurred billions of dollars in COPPA
fines by exploiting underage users,

340
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,971
and was saved only by my own cowardice,

341
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,641
which led to me throwing up on myself.

342
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,241
Anyway, I'll show myself out.

343
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,961
(SIGHS)

344
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,770
I'm so proud of you.

345
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,203
It took guts for you to tell me this.

346
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,123
Oh, no. No, no, no. It didn't, actually.

347
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,521
Full disclosure. I knew all about this.

348
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,696
I hacked into your phone
the first night we were together

349
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,856
when you were in the bathroom.

350
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,006
I was in there a while.

351
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,162
I was hoping that once I earned your trust,

352
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,483
you'd feel comfortable telling me,
and you finally did.

353
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,891
Idid.

354
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,136
This may sound crazy,
but if you hadn't by this weekend,

355
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,881
I was actually considering
disinviting you from my sister's wedding.

356
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,121
(CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY) N0 way.

357
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:42,286
But you trusted me with your big secret,
so I'll trust you with another of mine.

358
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,328
- Oh, no, no. You don't have to do...
- (SHUSHING)

359
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,002
(WHISPERING) I hacked the
elevators at the Freedom Tower.

360
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,570
No.

361

(mssnue)

362
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,451
Fucking kill me and send me
to the horrors of heaven.

363
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,841
It would be better than this shit.

364
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,730
Guys, I know this has been a ton of work,

365
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,690
and we wouldn't have to do
it if pretty boy kept his mouth shut,

366
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,367
and the stealth launch is
still clearly the play,

367
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,125
but now we can show Gavin
that we fleshed out both options

368
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,170
- and we can still push the
space-saving app - (DOOR OPENS)

369
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,811
and not talk about our new Internet
until we're ready.

370
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,369
- Ahoy, gents!
- Geary Street.

371
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,040
What, are you eating health food now?

372
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,844
Can you imagine? (CHUCKLES)

373
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,607
Geary Street Organics
is not a health food store?

374
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,287
(CHUCKLES) Richard, you are a stitch.
No, it's my dispensary.

375
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,484
I mean, they have some edibles there.
They're not very healthy.

376
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,483

_H€Y-
_H€Y-

378
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,442
Uh... Yeah. I was walking around your hood,

379
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,683
and I thought I'd swing by
and we could talk about tech, you know,

380
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,096
because we both know so much about it.

381
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,121
Cool.

382
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,886
Oh, man, I don't know if you noticed,
but your eyes are super red right now.

383
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,450
0h. yeah?

384
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,561
Yeah, I have allergies.

385
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,687
Really? This time of year?

386
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,082
- (Huh.

387
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,562
Hey, what are you doing?

388
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,927
Oh, just hanging, man. Why, you paranoid?

389
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,490
Paranoid? No.

390
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,760
You know, Bryce, I gotta be honest.
I'm a little hungry.

391
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,211
You have anything to eat?

392
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,931
Just some Creatine Protein Powder...

393
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,001
Soy extract.

394
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,640
Well, I'm kind of looking for something
a little bit more sweet.

- Oh, Bryce.

00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,325
Yeah, that's not mine.

397
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,131
That's for my guests. My fat guests.

398
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,282
You know, the fella
who owns the house I live in,

399
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,169
he buys food like this

400
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,561
because when he uses the products

401
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,962
he buys at the very same
health food store you go to,

402
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,408
he gets cravings for food just like this.

403
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,006
And this stuff is not good for your blood.

404
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,328
Geary Street Organics isn't
a food store, is it?

405
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,204
It's a pot dispensary.

406
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,281
Isn't it?

407
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,131
I gotcha, Bryce, you fuckin' liar.
(CHUCKLES)

408
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,323
You said you had a degree in CS?

409
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,084
Well, bullshit. l checked.

410
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:05,127
It's not "Computer Science"
it's "Callisthenic Studies."

411

What? What?

412
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,771
You listen to me,
you muscle-bound handsome Adonis.

413
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,322

Look, I know you've been
unhappy with me lately.

421
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,000
Correct.

422
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,287
Look, I'm asking you
to trust me on something.

423
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,329
Ed Chen has been making moves
behind your back with the other partners

424
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,243
to try and force you out of Raviga.

425
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,445
You are referring to the baby shower ruse.

426
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,001
You knew about that?

427
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,570
Monica, this is my fourth child.

428
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,325
I am no stranger to these
types of machinations.

429
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,129
- However, I have countervailed it with my...
- Your fourth child?

430
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,601
Yes.

431
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,921
As I was saying,

432
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,490
I have spoken to our top LPs
and lined up enough of them

433
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,206
in order to leave Raviga
and start a new firm.

434
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,080
It struck me as a opportune
time to jump ship.

435
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,961
Holy shit, you're a fucking ninja.

436
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,641
No.

437
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:25,570
Even though your disclosure just now
had absolutely no actionable value,

438
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:30,328
it did reveal tremendous loyalty,
so all is well now.

439
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,810
So, you're not mad at me anymore?

440
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,245
No, Monica.

441
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:40,851
Iam a human being just like you,
like Ed Chen, and this.

442
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,330
Furthermore, a question, Monica.

443
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,529
Would you care to jump ship with me?

444
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,289

or who told them to you, we may never know,

He's writing a tell-all?

473
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:05,722
Apparently he landed a very lucrative deal
to air my dirty laundry over the years.

474
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,690
He said it was his only career move left.

475
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,445
I told you, Richard.
Everything I do is news.

476
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,410
But didn't he sign an NDA with you?
I mean, can't you sue him?

477
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,320
That would only prove everything he's
saying is true and make it worse.

I had my blood tested this morning.

Richard, I'm sorry.

484
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,444
I told you that a big public roll-out of
our product would be good for the company.

485
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,081
The truth is,
I thought it would be good for me.

486
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,209

that I'm a fraud and a failure.

I'm a fraud and everyone knows it.

Something you want to
share with us, Richard?

515
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,449
I take it you saw the interview?

516
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:28,443
"Belson and Hendricks prepare to launch
a Pied Piper product soon."

517
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,363
So much for a stealth roll-out.

518
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,965
You went along with him, after all.

519
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:35,522
TechCrunch, and Recode, and The Wall
<i>Street</i> Journal picked it up, as well.

GILFOYLE: I hate to invoke the Nazarene,

521

but Jesus Christ, what the fuck, Richard?

522
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:45,926
Guys, in a world where
there is no Gavin Belson, yeah,

523
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,526
the stealth roll-out was the best play.

524
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,161
But we need his patent, and his funding,

525
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,084
and also we need his brain.

526
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,209
I know this is gonna be a shit ton of work,

527
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,926
but Gavin is our partner,
we need him engaged,

528
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,161
I made the call.

529
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,846
Well, sometimes you have
to make compromises.

530
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,571
I mean, I once slept with
the head of an assisted living facility

531
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,961
to get my friend Muriel
bumped up the wait list.

532
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,290
Am I proud of it? No.

533
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,361
Do I regret it?

537
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,006
Out of what, exactly?

538
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,451
My relationship!

539
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,204
The wedding got raided.

540
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,284
The FBI got an anonymous tip
about Mia's hacking exploits.

541
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,361
Can you believe that?

542
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,920
That's just my luck. I'm home free!

543
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,367
You ratted your girlfriend out to the FBI

544
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,284
because you're too big of a pussy
to break up with her?

545
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,523
I'll never tell, but, yes. Yes, I did.

546
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,410
The FBI lady hit me in the face,
so Mia's never gonna suspect me.

547
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,723
Uh, Richard,
now that Mia and I have parted ways,

548
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,689
can I come work for you at Gavin's, please?

549
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,760
Please. Please?

550
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,564
Well, yes, Dinesh. Of course.

551
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,401
Uh, in fact, we just announced,
so climb aboard.

552
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,883
(LAUGHING) Awesome! I'm gonna go
and call Periscope and tell them I quit.

<i>GAVIN: Richard, Iread your little article.</i>

557
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:08,163
What you said means a great deal.

558
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,696
I'm sure of the situation was reversed,
you'd do the same for me.

559
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,721
Absolutely not.

560
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,808
Iwould have let you
bleed to death in the street.

00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,087
On. (CHUCKLES)

Get back on the saddle, you. (CHUCKLES)

GAVIN: N0, Richard.

567
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,249
I have a lot of work I
need to do on myself.

568
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,651
I'm going away.

569
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,370
For, like, the weekend or...

<i>GAVIN: Iknow. Isent you something.</i>

Consider it a little parting gift.

Good luck to you, Richard.

577
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,811
It's from Gavin.

578
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,521
What is it?

579
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,211
It's the patent.

580
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,645
He just signed over full ownership to me.

581
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:06,083
<i>On the phone, he said
he was gonna go find himself.</i>

<i>I think Gavin's gone.</i>

583
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,766
Well, what about his funding and his brain?

584
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,320
I think he took both of those with him.
