I could use a walk.

- And, um, well, lthink better when lwalk...
- Mm-hmm.

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,848
...but if I'm going to be thinking and walking,
I might as well walk somewhere specific.

- Why are you writing it on there?

nutritional information or recipes,

you're Stanford CS material, Mr. Bighetti.

179

Why wouldn't you mention this to me?

to cling to things and he gave up on this.

the whole deal for only 200K.

pay them today and close the deal.

and they're so nice.

and they were like, "lt's up to you."

Oh, wow.

508
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,843
Mia is a legit hacker.

509
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,083
People say that she's taken
on the Chinese government,

510
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,204
and here you are after one meal
in an intimate relationship.

511
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,321
So?

512
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,731
So, what do you think she'll do
if you try to break up with her?

513
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,691
GILFOYLE: Or disagree with her?

514
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,967
Or disappoint her in any way?

that you're badass takedown of Gavin Belson

Unless you've already told her.

518
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,321
It didn't come up.

519
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,448
Well, I'm sure that when she finds out

520
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,490
that your entire relationship
is based on a lie of omission,

521
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,045
she'll be very understanding.

522
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,089
So what? We just won't break up.

523
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,366

Erlich, do you know how badly Ed Chen
just fucked me with Laurie?

526
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,251
Let me tell you something,

527
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,210
a threesome is always awkward,
especially the first one.

528
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,643
- Laurie being a little bit older...
-l'm talking about SeeFood.

529
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,131
What do you and Jian-Yang have?

530
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,201
Oh.

531
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,281
A whole lot of nothing.

- Are you... No. No, no, no.

533

SeeFood has to be great.
Myjob depends on it.

534
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,126
Ed Chen bailed
and dumped the whole thing on me.

535
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,122
Richard, can I speak with you
in the kitchen for a moment?

536
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,201
Yep. Sure.

537
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,409
So, what's up?

538
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,040
Well, here's the thing.

539
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,164
Remember that phone number
you were curious about in here?

540
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,130
Well, it's not a phone number,
it's a patent number.

541
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,084
A patent for exactly
what you were planning to build.

542
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,049
Uh, so Peter patented it.

543
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,170
No. I, um, spoke to Brian Fong.

544
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,721
Who?

545
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,370
- JARED: Brian Fong.
- Oh.

546
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,569
He told me that Peter
was very excited about the idea,

547
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,085
but there was some resentment

548
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,164
that he wasn't focused more
on what the team was working on.

549
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,244
So, one of them went out
and got a patent on it.

550
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,086
Why didn't this guy pursue it?

551
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,128
Well, the patent was just a roadblock

552
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,965
to keep Peter focused
on the company they were starting.

553
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,321
A company that went on
to be known as Hooli.

554
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,931
Wait, wait, wait.

558
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,966
I'm afraid so.
