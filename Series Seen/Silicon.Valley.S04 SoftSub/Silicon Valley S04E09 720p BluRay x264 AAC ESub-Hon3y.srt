RICHARD: Just think about it.

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,001
On Saturday, over a quarter-million people
are gonna stream through that building.

3

A veritable who's who of nobodies.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,209
Richard, we've tried
marketing at trade shows.

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,691
We suck at it.

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,603
No, I'm not talking about that.

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,521
Let me ask you this.

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,762
We need 120,000 phones, right?

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:33,967
What is the first thing people do
when they get in there?

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,131
Log on to free WiFi.

11
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,804
But Hooli makes you download
the Hoolicon app in order to sign in.

12
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:47,570
So what if we somehow
hack our code onto the app?

13
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,604
Then we will have our 120,000 phones
all in one day.

14
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,806
I'm sorry, you're...

15
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,168
You're talking about sneaking our code
onto people's phones

16
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,527
without them even knowing about it?

17
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,850
I mean, that's malware, Richard.

18
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,921
No, no, no.

19
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,931
Think of it more as, um, forced adoption
through aggressive guerrilla marketing.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,211
Well, as a product of forced adoption,
I can assure you, there are consequences.

21

- I like it.
- DINESHI Well, hold On.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,209
Even if we get our code
into that app and onto all those phones,

23
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,443
people are just gonna delete the app
as soon as the conference is over.

24
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,605

Get your phones out, right now.

just to like, exercise your brain.

43
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,925
Like, for instance,

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,810
if I had to hack the Hooli app servers,
mess with an app,

45
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,771
and push it out over a venue's free WiFi,
how would I do it?

46
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,280
It's a trick question, right?

47
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,408
'Cause you wouldn't hack the app server.

sneaking all that shit in.

174
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,845
GILFOYLE: Why? We're bringing tech
to a tech convention.

175
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,887
When did Pied Piper
get added to the vendor list?

176
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,281
JARED: C-42-10.

177
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,601
Oh.

178
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,290
Well, it looks like us.

179
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,048
JARED: Oh, no. That can't be.

180
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,523
No. This is not what I was promised.

181
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,801
What? It's fine.

182
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,531
Well, they told rne that we would have
prominent placement

183
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,728
with proximity to high-traffic corridor.

184
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,848
(LAUGHS)
We're in the middle of the road here.

185
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,128
- So?
- Yeah, who gives a fuck?

186
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,486
Well, Jared does.

187
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,040
And... And we do as well. Uh...

188
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,442
You know, why don't you go check out
what the bathroom situation's like?

189
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,727
Yes.

190
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,848
- Nothing would make me happier.
- Good.

191
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,491
You know, I actually believe him.

192
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,570
(SIGHS) okay-

193
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,044
So gentlemen, okay,
while Jared's gone, let's get our bearings.

194
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,286
All right.

195
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,966
So, uh, we are here.

196
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,849
Now you guys deploy the pineapples.

197
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,083
Start with high-traffic areas,
so that means entrances.

198
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,323
People are setting up equipment everywhere,
so it shouldn't look that unusual.

199
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,325
But be careful, don't get caught,
and remember why we're here.

200
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,487
WINNIE: Richard?

201
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,805
Whoa. Winnie!

202
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,047
- Hey.
- (CLEARS THROAT) Hello. Hi. Yeah.

203
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,804
- Oh.
- (BOTH CHUCKLE)

204
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,249
I haven't seen you since, um...

205
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,607
Since you threw yourself
down a flight of stairs

206
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,920
to prove how smart you were.

207
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,327
That whole spaces-tab thing was...

208
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,447
Kind of petty?

209
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,763
Petty? No, I was gonna say illustrative
of our vast differences, but...

210
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,927
Right. (CHUCKLES)

211
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,216
What are you doing here? (CHUCKLES)

212
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,480
I'm here helping my friend

213
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,449
- launch his new company.
- Oh.

214
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,648
Well, "my friend." He's
actually my boyfriend.

215
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,960
That's his booth right there.

216
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,169
RICHARD: Oh, wow. He's got a big one.
I mean, the booth.

217
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,288
But, um, boyfriend? Uh-oh.

218
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,762
- Awkward. (CHUCKLES)
- VVhy?

219
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,731
Nothing. It's not.

220
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,809
It's actually... Uh, it's cool.

221
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,120
Totally cool. Cool beans.

222
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,090
Beans, beans, magical fruit.
The more you eat, the more you...

223
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,366
- Toot?
- Toot.

224
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,208
Hey, Joel? Come over and meet Richard.

225
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,731
Oh. Not needed.

226
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,042
- Joel, Richard.
- Yeah. Hey.

227
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,645
Oh. Stairs guy.

228
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,883
- Uh, it's quite a booth you got there.
- Oh, yes, thank you.

229
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,804
We really think our company's message
is worth getting out there.

230
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,326
Yeah, us, too. Us, too.

231
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,164
Um, but just, you know,

232
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,447
trying to be a bit responsible
with the spending.

233
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,847
Sure, but when I sold my last company,

234
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,003
I realized I had the luxury
to invest in something I believe in.

235
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,656
- RICHARD: Mmm.
- Helping humanity thrive.

236
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,684
That's why I decided to bring
PeaceFare into the world.

237
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,966
Ah, good for you.

238
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,721
- Okay. It was great to meet you, Richard.
- Yeah. And you, too.

239
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,286
Good seeing you.

240
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,771
Not if I see you first. (CHUCKLES)

241
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,764
Not that you asked,
but you handled that very poorly.

242
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,686
You know, Jian-Yang,

243
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,048
the silence in the car
gave me some time to think about the fact

244
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,406
that our differences...

245
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,845
Jesus!

246
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,801
Sorry.

247
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,005
(TIRES SCREECH)

248
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,130
(ECHOES) Jian-Yang!

249
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,563
- Fuck you, fat fuck.
- Pineapple two is a go.

250
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,051
Fucking look at him.

251
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,569
Pictures everywhere, fucking bearded baby
cost us millions of dollars.

252
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,722
It would make me very happy

253
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,441
to pour boiling metal
down Keenan Feldspar's asshole.

254
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,686
- How would that even work?
- Flip and pour.

255
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,411
He's gonna run,
and then you're slowly chasing him,

256
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,881
trying to not spill your
vat of boiling metal.

257
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,803
You're gonna look like a fucking idiot.

258
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,927
GILFOYLEI Fuck you.

259
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,736
- Anybody looking?
- DINESH: (WHISPERS) No. Just go.

260
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,330
(CLICKING)

261
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,650
What's taking you so long? Hurry up!

(INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER)

263
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,325
What are you boys up to?

264
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,600
All right? All right, go through my slides.

265
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,365
Click, click, click. Jamiroquai plays.

266
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,445
Now I would very much
like to welcome my good friend,

267
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,363
Keenan Feldspar!

268
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,449
- Where the fuck is he?
- KEENAN: Yo.

269
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,762
Son, you're supposed to be
coming up from over there.

270
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,282
Totally. I'm just really kind of
digging the vibe over on this side.

271
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,964
- Uh, Terry?
- TERRY: (ON PA) Yeah.

272
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,884
- Kid wants to come from over here.
- TERRY: <i>Okay.</i>

273
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,724
Excuse me, sir. Do you have a moment?

274
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:12,727
This morning, Pied Piper were
a last-minute add to the vendor list.

275
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,644
So I started watching them
and noticed some suspicious behavior.

276
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,563
I've sent in for a tactical response team,

277
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,801
and with your permission,

278
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,656
I'd like to sweep the convention floor
with Yagi antennas, which are...

279
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,170
- Hoover?
- Yes, sir.

280
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:27,001
Four days ago, I spent two billion dollars
on a piece-of-shit VR gadget

281
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,411
that's never gonna work.

282
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,160
I had to rebuild the
entire operating system

283
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,642
just to get a 90-second demo
that could play on a phone.

284
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,361
And by the grace of God,
ljust may have pulled it off.

285
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,444
And now you want to talk to me
about Pied fucking Piper?

286
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,648
Sir, I'd like to think that
if Gavin Belson were here,

287
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,767
we'd make sure that...

288
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,605
Gavin fucking Belson is not here
'cause I fired his ass!

289
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,002
Now, look, you go back
to your little security room

290
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,287
and you sit in the corner
with the tinfoil hat on.

291
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,331
And I swear, ifl hear you wander
down the hallway to take a piss,

292
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,845
you are out on your ass.

293
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,160
You got that?

294
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,926
I do, sir.

295
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,965
You know what, this might be a good time
for me to hand out some flyers.

296

299
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,168
Yeah, actually.
(CLEARS THROAT) Very wrong.

- DINESH: What?

301
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,207
Yeah. Look at his website.

virtual homeless people.

to feed virtual starving villages.

noise about turning your mobile device

306
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,730
into an empathy machine,
but it's not doing anything.

307
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,086
Fascinating, Richard.

308
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,323
Have you heard anything
about how Pied fucking Piper is doing?

309
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,606
Yes, our code is in the app.

310
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,411
The pineapples are online.
We're at 3,700 downloads.

We're ahead of schedule.

312
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,041
Shit, this could work.

313
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,571
That's awesome.

314
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,244

He is not.

317
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,610
But, uh, she's with him
and I'm the petty one.

318
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,287
Okay, well, what about the idea
of growing real corn

319
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,408
to feed real starving people?

320
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,562
- No.
- Yeah, his thing seems way easier.

321
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,376

in your underwear.

00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,764
Uh, keep moving.

344
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,365
Fuck, do you think he saw us?

345
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,204
- Oh, he saw us.
- Fuck!

346
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,282
- He saw us see him.
- Shit.

347
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,850
Wait.

348
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,083
What if he thinks we did it on purpose?
Like, we snubbed him?

349
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,970
Fuck yeah.

350
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,611
We just snubbed the fuck
out of Keenan Feldspar.

351
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,161
- Hey, Richard.
- Hey.

352
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,165
I'm letting everyone know you might want
to reset your critical passwords

353
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,049
- because we've been hacked.
- Oh.

354
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,726
(STAMMERS) Why would you say that?

355
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,280
Well, someone changed
my PeaceFare screensaver,

356
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,762
and I know it wasn't anyone on my team
because they all respect me too much.

357
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,081
What did they change it to,
if you don't mind me asking?

358
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,336
- Just 'cause...
- No, no. lwon't dignify it by repeating it.

359
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,283
I'm just saying you
should take precautions.

360
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,169
Also, Winnie spoke to security

361
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,129
and they're sending
the tactical response team.

362
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,971
(CLEARS THROAT) The what?

363
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,129
The... Oh. Here they are.

364
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,807
Oh, shit.

365
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,163
Bingo. We've got hostiles.

366
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,326
Red team, Sebastian,
fan out and sweep the entire venue.

367
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,005
(BEEPING)

368
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,686
Hey, Richard.

369
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,081
Guess who has four thumbs
and just snubbed Keenan Feldspar?

370
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,207
Us.

371
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,486
Guys, someone called security.

372
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,976
- Now they're doing a sweep of the area, okay?
- What?

373
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,296
You've gotta go pull up
all the pineapples, okay?

374
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,924
- What the fuck?
- Who ratted us out?

375
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,970
I don't know. Probably we'll never know.
It's impossible to tell.

376
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,407
Just go. Go get them.
Get them now. Go, just go.

377
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,921
Oh.

378
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,240
Bingo.

379
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,441
DINESHI Fuck!

380
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,521
Come on.

381
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,841
(GRUNTS)

382
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,607
Bingo.

383
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,681
DINESH: Oh, crap.

384
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,684
We gotta split up. I'll take the food
court, you take the east concourse.

385
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,762
- I want the food court.
- Just go!

386
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,841
Fuck.

387
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,480
Hey, man.

388
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,928
(HESITATINGLY) Fucking Keenan.
Hey. I have to go.

389
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,446
Totally. Hey, did you snub me earlier?

390
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,521
No.

391
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,484
Yeah, you did.

392
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,766
You know you did.

393
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,211
- It made me feel bad. I like to feel good.
- (SIGHS)

394
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,400
Why would you do that to me?

395
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,965
Seriously?

396
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,642
You fucked us, Keenan.

397
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,040
Richard was gonna take that deal,

398
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,816
and then you pulled it
right out from under us.

399
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,083
You cost me, personally,
a shit ton of money.

400
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,960
Whoa. ls that what Richard told you?

401
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,449
(BEEPING)

402
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,245
- Hey. So?
- They got every single one.

403
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,560
- Every single last one.
- Fuck!

404
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,696
JARED: I don't want to hear this.

405
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,736
RICHARD: But we gotta be close, right?

406
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,856
Like how many more phones do we need?

407
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,376
I don't know. Close isn't good enough.

408
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,376
No, this is binary.
Either we have enough or we don't.

409
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,970
Oh, fuck.

410
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,246
I have an idea.

411
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,163
So I've got one pineapple left.

412
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:25,370
Now I've rigged some batteries on top of it
because we're gonna have to go mobile.

413
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,090
- Oh.
- We have to try.

414
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,896
Okay, I'm going to put
this in your backpack.

415
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,160
- Oh, no.
- No, it's fine.

416
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,004
I don't want it... I don't want it...

417
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,844
And you, you're gonna
hold this kill switch.

418
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:37,208
And then you'll walk into the most
densely populated area you can find.

419
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,616
All right? If you see the security coming,
remember, you press that button and poof,

420
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,801
- you're gone. Yeah?
- Okay.

421
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,736
I'll get as many
of those motherfuckers as I can.

422
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,920
We'll be rewarded in the end.

423
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,416
When the fuck were you gonna tell us?

424
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,566
Tell you what?

425
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,564
- You know what, fat sack of shit.
- Richard, do you know what?

426
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,881
N0, I don't. (STUTTERS) I don't know what.

427
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,200
Dinesh, you need to move.

428
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,487
- Well, not until I find out if you know what.
- (SIGHS)

429
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,961
Go on.

430
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,888
Okay, fine. I messed
with Joel's screensaver.

431
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,769
And then he told security,

432
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,411
and now they're the ones
pulling up all the pineapples.

433
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,016
- So...
- What the fuck are you talking about?

434
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,166
What are you talking about?

435
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,456
You acted like you wanted
to take Keenan Feldspar's offer.

436
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,086
Well, ljust ran into him.
He said you turned him down.

437
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,246
(STAMMERS)

438
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,686
Okay, well, (CHUCKLES)
who are you gonna believe, me or him?

439
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,525
Him. He showed me the email you sent him.

440
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,681
Showed you the email.

441
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,484
You fucking snake!

442
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,560
Dinesh, you need to move. Now.

443
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,449
Look, he pulled the deal.

444
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,936
Yeah, but you didn't know that
when you sent him the email, did you?

445
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,296
- Dinesh, you need to move.
- (BEEPING RAPIDLY)

446
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,084
Come on. You need to go.

447
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,400
- Go, go!
- TENLEY: Gentlemen?

448
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,480
(BEEP5)

449
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,966
I'm going to have to see
the contents of that backpack.

450
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,250
- Um...
- (RICHARD STAMMERS)

451
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,480
Bingo.

452
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,681
Huh.

453
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,121
(RICHARD SIGHS)

454
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,603
What did you change it to, Richard?

455
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,921
What?

456
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,490
Joel's screensaver.

457
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,722
- Does it matter now?
- No.

458
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,286
PoopFare. (SIGHS)

459
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,604
I'm sorry.

460
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,841
"PoopFare"?

461
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,641
Yeah. It's like a play on the name.

462
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,964
Is it a play on the name?
PissFare would be way better.

463
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,690
Or PenisFare.

464
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,969
Or PeaceFart. That's just
changing one letter.

465
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,044
Look, he turned around.
I had like a second, okay?

466
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,520
It's the best I could come up with.

467
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,201
PoopFare?

468
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,125
PoopFare?

469
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,487
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

470
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,761
You sacrificed everything
that we've worked for

471
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,525
for "PoopFare"?

472
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:52,288
How was PoopFare for the greater good?

473
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,126
It wasn't.

474
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,846
You compared yourself
to Abraham Lincoln, Richard.

475
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,849
Can you do me a favor?

476
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,927
Can you say it
so I know I'm not hallucinating?

477
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,450
- I just did.
- Just say it.

478
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,491
- Jared...
- Richard! Look me in the eyes!

479
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:17,084
Look me in the eyes,
and you name our undoing.

480
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,525
Hey, come on. Calm down now.

481
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:22,446
PoopFare? You reckless child.

482
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,641
Gentlemen. Come with me, please.

483
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,087
Sit down.

484
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,761
Well, well, well. Richard Hendricks.

485
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,530
Sorry, do I know you?

486
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,285
No. But I know all about you.

487
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,210
These WiFi pineapples, are they yours?

488
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,081
Uh-huh.

489
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,761
And this image from the security footage.

490
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,886
<i>GILFOYLE: Smell anything?</i>

491
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,600
These two individuals look familiar to you?

492
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,967
Last question.

493
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,649
Do you recognize this?

494
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:07,002
It's an interview I just found from
Code/Rag from October of this year,

495
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,242
in which you said
you and Gavin Belson would, quote,

496
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,322
"Put Jack Barker out of a job."

497
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,490
Did you say that, Richard?

498
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,371
You know what? Yes. Yeah.

499
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,281
Yep, this is me.

500
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:29,244
Because, apparently, everything I
say or type gets me into trouble.

501
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,163
Because I'm an idiot.

502
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,366
HOOVER: Well, now.

503
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,840
- Tenley!
- (DOOR OPENS)

504
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,922
What the hell are these gentlemen
doing in my office?

505
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,290
We caught them with pineapples.

506
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,041
You mean the pineapples that I hired them
to bring to the conference

507
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,806
as part of a covert penetration test
of our WiFi security?

508
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,048
Sorry. Uh, we didn't know.

509
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,440
HOOVER: You weren't supposed to.

510
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,923
Now, give these gentlemen
their passes and equipment back,

511
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,640
and get them back on the floor.

512
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:09,928
You know, you said some very nice things
about Gavin Belson in that interview.

513
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,603
You could have very easily
kicked a good man when he was down.

514
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,647

didn't want to see how it all turned out?

Do Dinesh and Gilfoyle know?

Richard, the fact that you think that
success justifies all your behavior...

We were in crisis mode, okay?

537
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,727

but crisis averted.

538
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,804

habeas corpus, huh?
