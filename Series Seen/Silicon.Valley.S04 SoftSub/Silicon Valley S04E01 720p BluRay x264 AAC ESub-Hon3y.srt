1
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,091
Oh, no, I'll get my car tomorrow.
I had too many.

2
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,731
Got an Uber coming, thank you.

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,966
That was fast.

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,127
- Hello. For Jim?
- RICHARD: Yup.

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,362
Oh, uh... Would you care for a water?

6
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,125
Why are your fingers orange?

7
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,284
It's iodine. I've been biting my nails.

8
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,096
So, I put this on there
to stop me from doing it.

9
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,120
Looks like Cheetos, tastes like asshole.
(CHUCKLES)

10
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,881
So, uh, what do you do?

11
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,648
Venture capital over at Wood Opal.

12
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,841
Wow.

13
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,680
Wow. Good.

14
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,131
- Mmm-hmm.
- (PHONE RINGING)

15
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,049
Uh, can I take this?

16
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,161
Sure.

17
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,566
All right.

18
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,485
<i>Hello. Hi.</i>

19
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,404
<i>My goodness.
This video chat app is light-years ahead</i>

20
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,120
<i>of anything else out there on the market.</i>

21
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,730
I agree. Yes.

22
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,644
And you can add multiple concurrent users

23
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,245
with no loss in picture quality.

24
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,004
Even on conventional 3G.

25
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,487
Let's see what happens
when we add more friends.

26
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,124
<i>Hi, friends. What's up?</i>

27
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,845
<i>Hello, "friend."</i>

28
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,402
<i>JARED: Hey. Should we add another friend?</i>

29
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,881
<i>Yeah, we should.</i>

30
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,089
<i>How many friends
can we conference at the same time?</i>

31
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,083
Well, uh, thanks to the amazing new

32
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,168
TURN server, as many as you like.

33
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,767
<i>But what if someone is in an
area with poor cellular reception?</i>

34
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,251
<i>I doubt it would even work.</i>

35
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,001
<i>And if it did, the lag, the video quality,
that would be horrible.</i>

36
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,730
Well, let's find out.

37
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,056
Could you keep your eyes
on the road, please?

38
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,684
Yep, yep. Got it. I'm on it.

39
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,602
<i>Hey, friends. Wow, look at that.
The image is so clear.</i>

40
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,170
<i>We all look amazing, don't we?</i>

41
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,084
<i>- Yeah, we really do.
- Yeah.</i>

42
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,128
Is that reallyjust on a cell signal?

43
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,570
Yes, this is the amazing
new company, PiperChat.

44
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,207
Wait a minute.

45
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,326
I saw you at TechCrunch.

46
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,006
You're Richard Hendricks.

47
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,167
The very same, yeah.

48
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,083
You're the fucking guy
that tried to walk into

49
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,043
Coleman Blair with fraudulent numbers.

50
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,201
No.

51
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,096
<i>- JARED: That was actually my fault.
- Yes, but, no.</i>

52
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,487
I mean, that's the old thing.
This is the new thing.

53
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,280
And I can assure you, it's very, very real.

54
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,966
You're not even my driver.
This says Sandeep in an Escalade.

55
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,451
- GILFOYLE: Shit.
- Look. Look.

56
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,482
No one will even talk
to us, which is crazy.

57
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,450
We just surpassed 120,000
daily active users,

58
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,808
and we're growing at
a rate of 18% organically week over week.

59
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,008
<i>Richard, that's Facebook level growth.</i>

60
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,176
- Pull over now.
- MAN: That <i>is</i> great.

61
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,645
<i>ERLICH: Richard, do not pull over.</i>

62
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,576
<i>You will never see him again
if he gets out of that car.</i>

63
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,456
<i>- I am not involved!
- ERLICH: Richard, can you hear me?</i>

64
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,896
<i>Okay, for real, Richard,
you have to pull over.</i>

65
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,160
<i>Richard, do not... Richard...</i>

66
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,896
<i>Richard, do not pull over,
you'll never see him again.</i>

67
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,536
<i>- Are you on the shitter?</i>
- Pull <i>the fuck over.</i>

68
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,800
<i>JARED: Pull over.</i>

69
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,081
ERLICH: Richard!
- Okay.

70
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,576
What the fuck? Are you
seriously trying to kidnap me right now?

71
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,680
No, it's the locks.
I don't know. This is not my car.

72
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,720
<i>Child locks are on.</i>

73
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,776
<i>I was babysitting
my friend Gloria 's great granddaughter.</i>

74
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,160
<i>ERLICH: Richard, do not pull over!</i>

75
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,686
<i>- God damn it!
- Got it.</i>

76
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,808
Look, look, look. Look. Come on.

77
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,851
Listen to me.
We are desperate. We need funding.

78
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,491
- You need funding?
- Yes.

79
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,044
Hit a million daily active users

80
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,840
while sustaining the same kind of growth.

81
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,444
Then everybody in town
will be trying to kidnap you.

82
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,807
Problem solved.

83
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,056
<i>ERLICH: Yeah, easy for you to say.</i>

84
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,367
<i>Can you imagine how much
these servers are costing me?</i>

85
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,249
<i>- Just to keep the ship afloat?
- Right.</i>

86
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,846
<i>And every new user
increases our server cost.</i>

87
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,287
Really? I'm sorry.

88
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,728
Is it hard to become a billionaire?

89
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,401
Welcome to the Valley, assholes.

90
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,611
- Fuck.
- ERLICH: <i>Whata dick.</i>

91
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,160
Well, assuming we don't get arrested,

92
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,920
looks like we have to work our asses
off to reduce our hosting bill.

93
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,400
- Hi.
- Hi.

94
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,131
If you actually get to a million users,

95
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,325
call me, my cell's on the back.

96
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,721
Okay.

97
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,682
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

98
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,321
GILFOYLEI Did you finish?

99
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,576
DINESH: Yeah, ljust pushed my code.

100
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,364
Took me two fucking days, but I broke up

101
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,807
our entire code base
into parallel services.

102
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,536
You know, this whole job
would have been a lot easier

103
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,881
if you hadn't designed sloppy
services in the first place.

104
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,121
Oh, silly me.

105
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,204
I guess when I hacked together the
video chat as an in-house tool,

106
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,090
I didn't foresee that
hundreds of thousands of people

107
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,970
would shit themselves
over how fucking awesome it was.

108
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,122
I'll never underestimate my talents again.

109
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,126
Don't worry. I'll continue
to do it for you.

110
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,363
Less talk, more work, boys.

111
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,090
I'm not paying you to coffee klatch

112
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,890
like a bunch of fucking yentas.

113
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,086
You're not paying us at all.

114
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,761
I'm not paying Y0“

115
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,336
because you're not the one getting fucked

116
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,044
face first by your credit card company

117
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,282
because of massive AWS hosting fees.

118
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,806
Well, you should bear
100% of the company's cost,

119
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,969
seeing as you do own 100% of the company.

120
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,240
What's taking you so long
to give us our fucking shares?

121
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,521
Recapping a company is complex.

122
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,731
But I assure you
Big Head and I are on the case.

123
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,200
DINESH: You better be.
We're not gonna work for free forever.

124
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,848
Hey, the Karachi Kid and I finished.

125
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,406
Did you push your code?

126
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,761
Uh...

127
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,801
Actually, no.

128
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,962
Well, Your Highness,
could you please push your code?

129
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,405
Well, I couldn't push that code

130
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,562
because I didn't write that code.

131
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,368
What? We stayed up for two fucking days.

132
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,010
Why didn't you write your code?

133
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,920
Well, because I was working on
something much better.

134
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,043
So, I started to
optimize our code to handle higher...

135
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,880
You're supposed to follow me.

136
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,767
I started to optimize our code
to handle higher traffic.

137
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,491
Then it occurred to me,
why rewrite our old code

138
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,921
when I can build a new encoder

139
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,129
that doesn't strip
away a ton of channels and metadata?

140
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:42,201
So, I extended my
compression algorithm to support, get this,

141
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,206
12-bit color.

142
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,523
Okay, so our users will
be able to experience

143
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,001
a 10% increase in image quality

144
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,681
with absolutely no increase
in server load whatsoever.

145
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,649
(STAMMERING) Just watch this.

146
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,241
Before.

147
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,605
After. Before. After.

148
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:08,522
Richard, I'm trying very hard
not to completely lose my shit right now.

149
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,840
I get it. I get it.

150
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,730
After every VC in town turned us down,

151
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,801
we decided

152
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,844
that the best way to stay alive

153
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,684
until we got to a million users

154
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,446
was to cut server usage.

155
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,806
Remember that?

156
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,769
The whole reason that Gilfoyle and I

157
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,888
stayed up for 48 fucking straight hours

158
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,204
was to decrease server load,

159
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,602
not keep it the same.

160
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,760
Technically, the reason
why we stayed up for two days

161
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,406
was to maximize our ability
to get a million users,

162
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,925
and I just did that.

163
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,408
Because who doesn't want
10% better image quality?

164
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,323
Who doesn't want it? Everyone.

165
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,885
Everyone doesn't want it!

166
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,769
GILFOYLE: We already have
the best video chat.

167
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,296
People are using this on their cell phones.

168
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,656
They're not going to be able
to tell the fucking difference.

169
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,409
Guys, this is a better product.

170
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,370
And I'm the CEO,
and I'm gonna say this is where we go.

171
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,210
- You fucking prick.
- Whoa.

172
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,250
Guys, please be civil.

173
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,651
You hate the video chat.

174
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,056
I don't hate the video chat, Dinesh.

175
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,296
You've always
hated the video chat because it's my thing,

176
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,016
and you want to rewrite it
to make it all about you.

177
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,166
You're fucking jealous.

178
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,367
RICHARD: Jealous?

179
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,441
- Jealous?
- DINESH: Yeah.

180
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,251
You built the video chat.
I'll give you that. Okay. You did.

181
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,368
But you did it using my algorithm.

182
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,602
Right, like when Picasso
painted a masterpiece,

183
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,096
the guy who made the brushes and the paint

184
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,406
deserved all the credit, right?

185
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,606
So you're Picasso now?

186
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,682
I think I need to leave.

187
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,046
But I love you guys.

188
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,849
Dinesh, I'm sorry, but I think

189
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,843
we should be doing a little bit more with

190
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,849
this revolutionary compression algorithm

191
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,206
than passable video chat.

192
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,362
But we already did more, Richard.

193
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,124
It was called the platform.

194
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,046
And it was exactly what you wanted
to make, and it fucking failed, okay?

195
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,600
I'm sorry, but it's bad
enough that we can't

196
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,011
get any funding because of you.

197
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,809
You're killing us out there.

198
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,565
Don't also sabotage us in here, too.

199
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,361
Pied Piper is a video chat company.
Get your head around that.

200
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,728
I'm quite certain I've
never said this before.

201
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,564
I agree with Dinesh.

202
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,081
Well...

203
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,361
Oh...

204
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,125
Well, that was just a whole heap of fun.

205
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,689
Ordinarily, I loathe coming to China.

206
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,176
But when you close a deal like that,

207
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,202
it makes the whole trip a delight.

208
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,650
Champagne, gentlemen?

209
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,529
I think that's very much in order.

210
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,084
I know you don't toot your own horn.
So I'll do it for you.

211
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,800
Here's to you, Jack.

212
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,689
And to your HoolilEndFrame box

213
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,481
becoming the most successful
American data storage appliance

214
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,767
to ever be manufactured in China.

215
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,761
Toot, toot.

216
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,811
Watch your back, Jeff Bezos.

217
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,446
Here comes Hooli.

218
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,208
All right. Gentlemen.

219
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,409
Our flight today from Shanghai
to Moffett Field in Mountain View

220
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,847
will bejust over 11 hours.
So, if you'll just...

221
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,811
Actually, lwas headed up to Jackson Hole,
see the wife and kids.

222
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,123
I was gonna charter up tomorrow, but maybe

223
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,363
you could ask the boys
just to drop me off on the way?

224
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,448
- Save me the trouble?
- Of course.

225
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,760
Well, and I mean, it's really not a big
deal, but since we are headed east,

226
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,808
I think Jackson is further.

227
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,325
Maybe we'll head to Moffett first,

228
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,936
then have the guys hop you on to Jackson.

229
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,961
- Okay?
- Okay_

230
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,969
Well, actually, on flights like this,

231
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,009
the boys like to go over the Pole.

232
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,931
So that, technically,
is a little more north to south,

233
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,207
and Jackson is quite a bit further north,

234
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,250
so I think maybe just go to Jackson first,
then head on off to Moffett.

235
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,685
- That sound good?
- Of course.

236
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,165
Great.

237
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,844
Get a pillow.

238
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,522
Now, you know what we desperately need

239
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,806
is a palapa.

240
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,160
A ploppa?

241
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,005
A <i>palapa</i>

242
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,811
It's a Mexican structure with palm fronds.

243
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,087
It's essentially a gazebo,

244
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,528
but spicier, and with a
south-of-the-border kind of vibe.

245
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,766
I think it would make us feel less exposed,

246
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,327
and generally,
I think it would be good for morale.

247
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,124
Speaking of which, morale has not

248
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,890
exactly been skyrocketing, so...

249
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,091
<i>We need to get
this cap</i> table <i>done tout de suite.</i>

250
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,689
Richard and the fellows are entitled
to 40% of the company.

251
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,050
Now, if we each give
20%, we would still own

252
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,765
30% each.

253
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,966
That seems fair.

254
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,371
Seems totally fair to me.

255
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,450
- Dad?
'Nope.

256
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,280
<i>Not gonna happen.</i>

257
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,847
Mr. Bighetti, with all due respect...

258
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,763
<i>If you had any respect, you wouldn't have</i>

259
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,769
<i>talked my son into wasting his money.</i>

260
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:38,121
<i>Again. My son's not
giving up one share. Not now, not ever.</i>

261
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,483
Mr. Bighetti, if you're going to
control your son's board seat,

262
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,210
these decisions have to be unanimous.

263
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,496
You're going to kill this company if we...

264
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,567
<i>I don't care.</i>

265
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,248
<i>In my eyes, the company is already dead.</i>

266
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,006
<i>Killed by you.</i>

267
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,766
<i>That's my edge.</i>

268
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,886
<i>If all I accomplish by doing
this is making you as miserable</i>

269
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,770
<i>as you've made me
watching you fleece my son,</i>

270
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,446
<i>then I'm okay with that.</i>

271
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,570
He seems okay with that.

272
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,921
So you expect me to give the 40%

273
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:10,167
to the gents from my 50%,
effectively leaving me with 10%?

274
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,647
<i>Yes.</i>

275
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,370
No. No, no, no.

276
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,408
Then lwould have invested 500...

277
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,565
A half of a million dollars
just to end up where I started?

278
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,841
Unacceptable.

279
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,647
<i>I can accept that.</i>

280
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,281
<i>I'm going to bed.</i>

281
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,926
<i>Goodnight, brown bear.</i>

282
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,406
Love you, papa bear.

283
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,084
(LAUGHING)

284
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,441
(LAUGHING CONTINUES)

285
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,929
Goddamn motherfucker.

286
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,016
RICHARD: I mean, the guys are right.

287
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,963
I'm fucking up the company.
I'm not helping.

288
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,167
In any way.

289
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,165
You're certainly not
helping your cuticles by biting on them.

290
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,969
Your nail beds are gonna get infected.

291
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,920
Where'd you learn how to do this, anyway?

292
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,486
Oh, uh, when I was on the street,
it was a means of survival.

293
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,569
(CLEARS THROAT) I don't know. This is...

294
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,166
I mean, I almost killed us, the company.
And that is so selfish.

295
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,322
I mean, if we have to hit a million users,

296
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,608
I need to get us funding right now.

297
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,843
How? We've already been turned down

298
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,689
by every respectable VC in town.

299
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,960
Who said anything about respectable?

300
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,811
Oh, Richard, no.

301
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,136
Fuck yes, I want to talk business.
What's the play?

302
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,800
Let's fuck this thing right in the pussy.

303
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,776
Thanks for meeting rne here.
My fucking nanny got another DUI

304
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,881
and lost her license.

305
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,976
So now I'm stuck
picking up my own kid like an asshole.

306
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,001
So, what's up?

307
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,681
Uh...

308
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,287
Well, I know you wanted to buy
Erlich's Pied Piper shares

309
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,283
back in the previous
iteration, the platform.

310
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,249
Well, I was hoping you'd want to come on as

311
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,249
a follow-on investor for
the current platform.

312
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,606
- The video chat?
- Yeah.

313
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,160
It's got great tech. We're
growing like crazy.

314
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,720
In fact, that's why we need funding,
to keep up with the users.

315
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,684
And I think it could be really good,
if we could just keep it going.

316
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,326
No, you don't.

317
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,041
What?

318
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,447
You don't like it.

319
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,440
You don't believe
in this product you're selling.

320
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,046
Russ...

321
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,121
No, it's a good, sound business.

322
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,522
As I said, the tech is great,
and all the guys are really behind it.

323
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,688
But you're not behind it, Richard.
I can tell.

324
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,331
And as much as you want to be, you're not.

325
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,041
Look, it's like this.

326
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,251
You're trying to date a woman.

327
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,896
But deep down in your heart,
you know you're gay.

328
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,967
Uh...

329
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,249
Deep in your soul, you know
you would rather be plowing a dude.

330
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,410
I don't...

331
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,720
Okay, what dude?

332
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,360
It could be any dude,
as long as you really want to fuck him.

333
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,963
It could be a twink, a bear,
an otter, a circuit queen,

334
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,769
a chub, a pup, gipster, a daddy chaser,

335
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,649
a leatherman, a ladyboy, a Donald Duck.

336
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,856
Donald Duck's a gay guy
that's been kicked out of the Navy.

337
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,280
How do you know so many gay things?

338
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,040
My grandfatherjust came out of the closet.
Beautiful, very inspiring.

339
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,206
Look, the point is,

340
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,930
if you're gonna spend all day fucking,

341
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,244
shouldn't Pied Piper be a dude
you wanna fuck?

342
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,160
All right, let's do an exercise.

343
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,736
You've got unlimited time and resources,

344
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,376
you can build anything
in the world you want

345
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,896
with your compression, anything at all.

346
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,376
What's it gonna be? Three, two, one, go!

347
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,050
- Russ, I don't...
- Go, go, go!

348
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,691
You said I have unlimited time?

349
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,761
Now, now, now!

350
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,121
A new Internet.

351
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,091
What? Why?

352
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,291
Okay, well, I haven't really
thought this through, so...

353
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,647
Um...

354
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,401
Okay.

355
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,964
- I own a telescope.
- Of course you do.

356
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,007
And I brought it out one night
to look at the full moon.

357
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,081
Of course you did.

358
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,049
And I got to thinking,

359
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,086
"Wow. We put a man on the moon

360
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,164
"using the computing power
of a handheld calculator."

361
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,685
And then I thought,

362
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:44,765
"Okay, there's literally millions of times'

363
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,922
"more computing power in my phone,

364
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,810
"and that's just
sitting in my pocket doing nothing, right?"

365
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,209
So then I thought, "There's, what,

366
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,647
"billions of phones all around the world

367
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,200
"with the same computing power,

368
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,083
"just sitting in people's pockets."

369
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,731
So then I thought,

370
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:04,408
"What if we use all those phones
to build a massive network?"

371
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,527
And here's the kicker.

372
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,409
We use my compression algorithm

373
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,616
to make everything
small and efficient to move things around.

374
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,803
And if we could do it,

375
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,009
we could build a completely decentralized

376
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,525
version of our current Internet.

377
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,960
With no firewalls, no tolls,
no government regulation, no spying.

378
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:28,011
Information would be totally
free in every sense of the word.

379
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,010
You want to build a new Internet?

380
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,286
Yeah, it's...

381
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,011
Richard, I like it. That I would fund.

382
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,728
Well, I don't know if it's possible, and...

383
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,087
Look, if this new Internet
is the man of your dreams,

384
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,816
and this is the man that you want to fuck,

385
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,251
then you need to fuck him.

386
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,129
That man, lwill pay you to fuck.

387
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,288
Where the fuck is that kid?

388
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,447
Wait a minute.

389
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,527
Oh, shit.

390
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,280
They kicked us out of this place.

391
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,126
I'm at the wrong fucking school!

392
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,523
Richard, you find that man, fuck him good.

393
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,816
Careful, please. He's gonna peel out.

394
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,841
(TIRES SCREECHING)

395
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,205
Monica, I need to...

396
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,561
Oh.

397
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,290
- You're not...
- Monica?

398
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,725
No, thank God.

399
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,121
I'm Ed Chen.

400
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,731
Laurie put me in the good office

401
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,251
and moved Monica down the hall.

402
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,810
Way down the hall.

403
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,050
Okay. Sorry.

404
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,562
You're gonna listen to Russ Hanneman?

405
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,048
Richard, you sound like a crazy person.

406
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,088
I know, but Russ is right.

407
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,731
I mean, I hate the video chat. I really do.

408
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,606
What?

409
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,603
Oh, wow. You can see right into the...

410
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,966
Yeah, I'm very aware.

411
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,841
Laurie is punishing me for taking
your side and going against her.

412
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,161
So, she moved me down here,

413
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,767
and gave my office to that
little brownnosing shit, Ed Chen.

414
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,123
Anyway, Richard, you're not gonna seriously

415
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,203
go home and tell the guys in your company

416
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,805
that even though your user rates

417
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,609
are skyrocketing, that you wanna pivot?

418
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,768
For the past 48 hours, I've been trying

419
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,803
to rewrite the core video chat code,

420
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,325
and I literally can't.

421
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,568
Instead of typing, ljust
bite my fingernails.

422
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,210
I think, subconsciously,

423
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,802
I would rather bite my own fingers
off than work on this platform.

424
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,729
Richard, I know people who have spent

425
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,683
their entire careers chasing after an app

426
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,047
with this kind of growth
rate, and never hit it.

427
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,451
It's a really good product.

428
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,121
That may be, but it's not for me.

429
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,043
And look, I know these guys are my friends,

430
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,083
but they are also my employees.

431
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,525
And it's my company.

432
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,923
So, if I say we have to pivot, we pivot.

433
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,051
Okay. I have to go.

434
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,296
All right, well, if you're sure,

435
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,496
then tell them and then call me and tell...

436
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,010
Well, no, I have to go...

437
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,729
There's another men's room
on the fourth floor.

438
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,480
Right.
'Cause then you would have seen mine twice.

439
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,204
I mean, we're all thinking it, right?

440
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,210
Richard is
fucking with a product that is working.

441
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,931
He should not be the CEO of this company.

442
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,562
(SIGHS) I understand your concerns,
but is this the time that we fire Richard?

443
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,802
I mean,
is this the moment that I become the CEO?

444
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,246
YOU? Why yQu?

445
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,561
It's a simple process of elimination.

446
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,884
Gilfoyle is an anarchist,

447
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,090
would never accept a position of
authority in any official organization.

448
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,771
- None.
- And you, of course, are out of the picture

449
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,524
because Gilfoyle would never allow it.

450
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,841
Yeah, that's true.

451
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,481
And Jared, he'd sooner commit hari-kari

452
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,245
than replace little baby Richard.

453
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,761
So, that leaves me.

454
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,616
And honestly, gents,
who would you rather have

455
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,371
defending your 4% stake
in the company than...

456
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,851
- Five.
- What?

457
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,921
5%.

458
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,001
You said four. Was it...

459
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,976
- Or you said three, and then you had...
- DINESH: No.

460
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,331
- It's five.
- GILFOYLE: Five.

461
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,324
You know what,
I'm gonna back channel, look at some notes.

462
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,246
And we'll get to it.

463
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:52,885
In the meantime, if and when
we are to depose Richard,

464
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,451
I am his obvious heir.

465
00:18:54,520 --> 00:19:00,323
Erlich, no offense, but the board is
you, Richard, and my dad. Right?

466
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,051
So, I think that means you and my dad

467
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,806
would have to agree on
who replaces Richard,

468
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,646
and pretty sure my dad
would, like, never approve you.

469
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,136
- I mean, it'sjust not gonna happen.
- Thank you.

470
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,161
Yeah.

471
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,571
There is someone else.

472
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,321
Someone who has zero strikes against him.

473
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,649
Someone who has held high-level positions

474
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,411
at one of
the biggest tech companies in the Valley.

475
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,640
Someone who's been on the cover

476
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,446
of one of the most prestigious
tech publications in the world.

477
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,282
He sounds awesome. Could we get him?

478
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,929
And as of now, we've got the votes

479
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,769
of enough key Malaysian ministers

480
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,205
to proceed with construction.

481
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,487
But that support is time critical.

482
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,609
Carol is right. We'd have to break
ground before monsoon season,

483
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,047
or else the entire project could collapse.

484
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,645
So, what do you think?

485
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,361
Sorry.

486
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,961
- About what?
- About the factory.

487
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,681
Ah. The factory.

488
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,805
The factory.

489
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,200
Will you excuse me for a moment?

490
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,521
- So, what have you got?
- Well, sir, I did as you asked.

491
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,644
I flew the company plane to Shanghai,

492
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,330
then Moffett, then Jackson Hole.

493
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,969
Then I flew back to Shanghai,
then to Jackson Hole,

494
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,247
then to Moffett, which
is where ljust landed.

495
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,367
And?

496
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,889
Moffett is 28.3 minutes closer.

497
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,041
I fucking knew it!

498
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,816
Barker should have dropped
you off first, sir.

499
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,128
Wait. What about
headwinds or storm activity?

500
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,440
I don't want to
give him any room to wriggle out of this.

501
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,536
This is what I'm gonna need you to do.

502
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,404
Fly each leg five more times,
and average them.

503
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,845
It's the only way to be sure.

504
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,524
And we're not concerned with the expense

505
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,602
of 20 more private
transcontinental flights?

506
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,846
Of course we are.

507
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,004
Jack Barker is costing the
shareholders of this company a fortune,

508
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,570
and he must be stopped.

509
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,000
I'll go back to Moffett right now.

510
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,816
Good. Call me each time you're in Shanghai.

511
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,524
- L'll see you in a week.
- Yes, sir.

512
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,409
- Guys?
- Shit, he came in the back.

513
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,970
Richard, we need to talk.

514
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,801
All right, well, actually,
let me just say something first here. Um...

515
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,200
I don't think
Pied Piper should be a video chat company.

516
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,130
The balls on you.

517
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,641
Richard, we've all decided.

518
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,210
You are out.

519
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,290
Big Head is in.

520
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,360
Not my call.

521
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,880
Richard, we just can't
keep fucking pivoting.

522
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,416
- We won't do it again.
- Just wait for a second, okay?

523
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,656
Ijust... You're not getting it.

524
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,681
Please. Uh...

525
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,481
I'm quitting.

526
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,881
Wait, what?

527
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,448
Richard! I was waiting out front.

528
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,896
They wanna ambush you and replace you

529
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,800
with Big Head, but I had
nothing to do with it!

530
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,526
Again, not my call.

531
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,561
I was ready to fight you guys,
but then on the way home,

532
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,768
it occurred to me there
might be a better way.

533
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,520
I'm gonna start my own company.

534
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,482
I will give up all of my
equity in the video chat

535
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,561
if I get to completely own my algorithm.

536
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,006
I will grant you guys a perpetual license

537
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,003
to use the algorithm in your video chat,

538
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,004
but I need the algorithm
to build something else.

539
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,009
And look, forget a million users,

540
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,764
with me out of the company, you guys

541
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,530
will be able to raise money no problem.

542
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,729
And that way, everybody wins.

543
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,885
So we can use the algorithm,
free and clear, for video chat?

544
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,007
Yes.

545
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,407
I mean, we shouldn't even
be talking about this.

546
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,370
And you would leave behind your 25%,

547
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,445
thus giving me enough equity
to compensate the boys fairly,

548
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,841
and Big Head's father would retain his 50%?

549
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,246
I think that's right, yes.

550
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,363
And I would own 10% of your new company.

551
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,521
Wait, what? Why?

552
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,416
The algorithm
was developed here in the incubator.

553
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,010
Richard, shame on you.

554
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,090
Well, deal breaker.

555
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,456
Let's... Should we get some food?

556
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,289
No, no. That's okay. It's fine.

557
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,489
And I'm here for advice,

558
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,041
or advice for the new CEO,
whoever that may be.

559
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,207
To wit, I know it's probably not my
place to give this suggestion,

560
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,004
but I think it should be Dinesh.

561
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,886
- What?
- What?

562
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,769
- Yeah. Sorry, Big Head.
- What?

563
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,520
Yeah, Dinesh, you were the one that hacked

564
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,176
together the video chat in the first place.

565
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,640
You know the product inside and out.

566
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,803
You are the horse that I would bet on.

567
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,323
- You really think so?
- I do.

568
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,886
I'm down.

569
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,407
Gilfoyle?

570
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,291
Gilfoyle, can I please
be CEO of Pied Piper?

571
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,130
Spoken like a true leader.

572
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:36,289
But since your
failure as a leader is a virtual certainty,

573
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,840
tolerating your short reign as CEO

574
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:42,367
in exchange for a front row seat
to the disaster seems fair.

575
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,721
Plus, if I'm wrong, which
I'm not, I get rich.

576
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,370
So, I'm down with Dinesh.

577
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,930
Jared, what do you think about this?

578
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,604
I think this is crazy.

579
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,729
I left myjob at Hooli
to come work with you, Richard.

580
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,800
And now you're leaving?

581
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,763
Look, these guys are gonna need you.

582
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,207
So if you wanna support me,
you support them.

583
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,121
Think you can do that?

584
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,325
JARED: I've always been very adept
at taking the shape

585
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,364
of whatever shoe was pressed down upon me.

586
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,169
So, I can try to make it work.

587
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,560
ERLICH: Then it's settled.

588
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,002
Dinesh is the new CEO of Pied Piper.

589
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,047
Oh, actually, just one last thing.

590
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,249
I think you guys should
call yourselves PiperChat.

591
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,641
I'm gonna have to insist
that I keep the name Pied Piper,

592
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,767
and I won't budge on that.

593
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,376
- Yeah, that's totally fine.
- Okay, yeah.

594
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,696
Who gives a shit? It's a
terrible fucking name.

595
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,960
- That's fine.
- Yeah.

596
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,326
Let's get to work!

597
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,686
Congratulations.

598
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,721
So, wait, I don't have to be CEO, right?

599
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,691
Dinesh is gonna do that?

600
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,600
ERLICH: All right,
let's figure out how this gets split up.

601
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,645
DINESH: Let's see, and yeah.

602
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,405
- I think we can get 'em all a point, right?
- Jared. Go.

603
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,561
Go on, man.

604
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,601
Get out of here.

605
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,810
ERLICH: Dinesh, you'll get 5%.

606
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,089
Gilfoyle 5%, and Jared 5%.

607
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,527
DINESH: Yeah, okay,
so we all get five, not four.

608
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,364
ERLICH: Now you said... You said four?

609
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,244
No, five. I said five.

610
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,123
Jared, can we get five more engineers?

611
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,176
ERLICH: That would come out
of Jared's percentage.

612
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,326
DINESHI N0...

613
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,000
You wanted to see me, Skipper?

614
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,281
I did, indeed.

615
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,041
Jack, I appreciate everything you've done

616
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,726
in your position as
head of the HoolilEndFrame box.

617
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:48,043
But I think
the company's needs are better suited

618
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,645
if I move you elsewhere.

619
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,801
Really?

620
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:56,645
Well, I appreciate the vote of confidence,
GB. I mean, I'm flattered.

621
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,521
Frankly, little bit surprised.

622
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,726
Why would you be surprised?

623
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,326
Can you think of any reason
why you don't deserve a promotion?

624
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,526
I mean, anything at all?

625
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,286
Well, I don't want to hurt my
arm patting myself on the back,

626
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,601
but right off the top of my head...

627
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,811
No, I guess not.

628
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,528
I mean, you've always
been straight with me, right?

629
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,250
Straight to the point?

630
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,761
I sure have.

631
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:24,049
And you've always gone
out of your way for me, yes?

632
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,291
Always put me first?

633
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,001
Gone the extra mile?

634
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,601
Gosh.

635
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,401
I sure tried.

636
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,001
Did yQu?

637
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,410
All right, Jack. Professor.

638
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,041
Gary in HR will set you up.

639
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,921
Enjoy your new offices.

640
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,850
Thank you, sir.

641
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,206
Oh, hey.

642
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,091
Would you like to see your desk?

643
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,961
Okay.

644
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,081
Here it is.

645
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,850
This is your desk.

646
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,449
