1
00:00:01,099 --> 00:00:03,199
<i>Previously on Prison Break.</i>

2
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:05,793
It's the only building on top of those tunnels.

3
00:00:05,877 --> 00:00:10,045
All we gotta do is get in there, on PI,
and dig ourselves an on-ramp.

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,713
I'm gonna find out, you know,
what it is you're doing up there.

5
00:00:13,796 --> 00:00:17,505
If we talked about who had motive
to kill Terrence, we'd be here all day.

6
00:00:17,589 --> 00:00:21,422
- To do with EcoField?
- Do the math. CEO gets indicted for fraud.

7
00:00:21,505 --> 00:00:24,132
Investors start losing money. Lots of money.

8
00:00:24,299 --> 00:00:28,175
- Call Nick Savrinn. Works for Project Justice.
- They're here.

9
00:00:28,258 --> 00:00:32,091
<i>Who's here? LJ? LJ!</i>

10
00:00:33,009 --> 00:00:36,635
- You gotta come get me.
- We can't, we're not in Chicago. Come to us.

11
00:00:36,718 --> 00:00:39,510
- First of the month's coming up, John.
- Yeah. So?

12
00:00:39,594 --> 00:00:42,677
I checked my balance.
It's looking deficient.

13
00:00:42,761 --> 00:00:45,512
Apparently Fibonacci's
coming up for air again.

14
00:00:45,596 --> 00:00:49,971
If he testifies at that hearing
a lot of people are going down,

15
00:00:50,055 --> 00:00:51,471
including me.

16
00:00:51,554 --> 00:00:54,639
Listen. There, uh...
there's been a restructuring.

17
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:59,766
<i>This comes from Philly himself.
So I'm the man in here now.</i>

18
00:01:00,891 --> 00:01:03,390
What the hell are you doin'? Aargh!

19
00:01:03,474 --> 00:01:06,100
<i>Uh-oh. We got a problem.</i>

20
00:01:06,768 --> 00:01:08,934
Bellick? What's going on?

21
00:01:09,017 --> 00:01:12,061
That's PI. I run it.

22
00:01:12,517 --> 00:01:14,894
Not any more, you don't.

23
00:02:19,518 --> 00:02:21,643
Bellick.

24
00:02:21,898 --> 00:02:24,899
- Hey, boss.
- Check that volume, inmate.

25
00:02:24,982 --> 00:02:29,400
We've been doing business too long.
We can fix this thing, right?

26
00:02:29,484 --> 00:02:34,193
Let's get something clear. You and I haven't
done crap. Falzone's the one payin' me.

27
00:02:34,276 --> 00:02:38,194
He's just an envelope. You've been
doing business with me face to face.

28
00:02:38,277 --> 00:02:41,695
You think I like getting piss thrown at me?
Spit on?

29
00:02:41,779 --> 00:02:47,654
Other chumps might do it for 40 grand a year
and the little uniform, but I'm not that dumb.

30
00:02:47,737 --> 00:02:52,281
Falzone's envelope is the only reason
I come through that fence every day.

31
00:02:52,365 --> 00:02:56,323
And it's the only reason
I'm gonna keep coming through that fence

32
00:02:56,406 --> 00:02:59,240
until I have enough money
to buy a house on Lake Gray.

33
00:02:59,324 --> 00:03:03,240
I'm thinking early retirement, John.
And you're interfering with that.

34
00:03:03,324 --> 00:03:08,408
Hey, boss. Just give me some time and I can
match whatever Falzone's paying you.

35
00:03:08,492 --> 00:03:11,993
You're out of business. Get used to it.

36
00:03:12,077 --> 00:03:15,078
Hey, boss. Boss!

37
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:40,625
They're gonna find it. The longer they're
in there, the sooner they're gonna find it.

38
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:43,126
Then we gotta get back in there.

39
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:47,085
- I'm gonna say something crazy to you now.
- Surprise, surprise.

40
00:03:47,168 --> 00:03:51,920
- I don't give a damn about that Fibonacci.
- You're right. That is crazy.

41
00:03:52,003 --> 00:03:55,836
Because I got bigger things to think about,
like survival.

44
00:04:07,006 --> 00:04:09,424
Then why are we talking about Fibonacci?

45
00:04:09,508 --> 00:04:14,050
The only way I can get that room back
is if I can prove to Falzone I'm still worthy,

46
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:16,468
that I've still got what it takes. Yeah?

47
00:04:16,551 --> 00:04:21,677
And the only way I can do that
is if I can give him Fibonacci.

48
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,677
Interesting.

49
00:04:23,761 --> 00:04:28,720
You see, this is not
a me-versus-you thing any more. This is us.

50
00:04:28,804 --> 00:04:32,639
An us thing, all right? It's us for the escape.

51
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,722
Is it? Or is this about you getting back
in good with the Mob again?

52
00:04:36,806 --> 00:04:38,931
That life is over for me, fish.

53
00:04:39,014 --> 00:04:41,390
I mean, they clipped my wings.

54
00:04:41,473 --> 00:04:45,641
They want me to rot in here,
so I got no allegiance to them any more.

55
00:04:45,724 --> 00:04:48,974
And yet you still want to do them a favour.

56
00:04:51,226 --> 00:04:53,850
Falzone is desperate.

57
00:04:53,934 --> 00:04:57,560
See, if Fibonacci testifies
in front of the Congress next month,

58
00:04:57,644 --> 00:05:00,353
Falzone's gonna go down in flames.

59
00:05:00,436 --> 00:05:04,520
But if we give him Fibonacci,
he will give us anything.

60
00:05:05,062 --> 00:05:07,979
Anything. Including that very special room.

61
00:05:10,396 --> 00:05:13,481
What do you say, fish?

62
00:05:16,981 --> 00:05:21,941
"And the Lord said unto Satan,
'Hast thou considered my servant Job?"'

63
00:05:22,024 --> 00:05:26,567
"'That there is none like him in the earth.
A perfect and an upright man."'

64
00:05:26,651 --> 00:05:30,152
"'One that fears God and shuns evil."'

65
00:05:30,776 --> 00:05:32,860
- Give him up.
- They'll kill him.

66
00:05:32,944 --> 00:05:37,070
- Maybe he deserves it.
- That's just it. He doesn't.

67
00:05:37,153 --> 00:05:39,529
Who is this guy? You told me he was Mafia.

68
00:05:39,612 --> 00:05:43,363
He was working for the Mafia.
He just didn't know it.

69
00:05:43,446 --> 00:05:47,864
Otto Fibonacci is... He's just like you.

70
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:52,615
An innocent man,
caught in the wrong place at the wrong time.

71
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:58,575
<i>- What are you doing?
- You know I didn't steal from you, John.</i>

72
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:01,785
<i>He was management
at one of Abruzzi's warehouses.</i>

73
00:06:01,868 --> 00:06:06,244
<i>Just a normal guy-
working class, religious.</i>

74
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:11,036
Hey, Nicky. Nicky, Nicky, Nicky. Sh.

75
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:14,578
What did I tell you about talking?

76
00:06:14,662 --> 00:06:16,829
<i>John, please.</i>

77
00:06:19,705 --> 00:06:22,164
Johnny, please! No!

78
00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:27,165
<i>Somebody that couldn't
turn his back on murder.</i>

79
00:06:27,332 --> 00:06:31,833
<i>He realised that Abruzzi and Falzone,
the men he worked for, were killers.</i>

80
00:06:31,917 --> 00:06:35,708
<i>He had the key to their dealings
that could put them away for life.</i>

81
00:06:35,792 --> 00:06:38,835
<i>And now he's in witness protection for life.</i>

82
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:42,545
<i>The judge asked why he was coming forward
with this information.</i>

83
00:06:42,627 --> 00:06:45,920
<i>He said it was because
he thought it was the right thing to do.</i>

84
00:06:46,461 --> 00:06:48,796
What's the right thing to do now, Michael?

85
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:51,255
I don't know.

86
00:06:51,338 --> 00:06:55,505
But if I don't give him up,
this whole thing's over.

87
00:06:57,714 --> 00:07:01,923
What you're telling me is if... if I'm to live...

88
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:07,216
A good man has to die.

89
00:07:08,684 --> 00:07:13,784


90
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,761
<i>- Kellerman.
- You're where we discussed?</i>

91
00:07:51,845 --> 00:07:56,303
Yes. I'm still not exactly sure
why we're here, but...

92
00:07:56,387 --> 00:07:59,513
- A friend of mine should be along shortly.
- A friend?

93
00:07:59,596 --> 00:08:01,888
<i>Just to see where you are with things.</i>

94
00:08:01,972 --> 00:08:05,389
We're clear on where we are.
Everything's under control.

95
00:08:05,472 --> 00:08:08,681
Nothing will affect tomorrow,
if you're worried.

96
00:08:08,764 --> 00:08:14,307
<i>I'm not worried about tomorrow.
My friend is a problem solver, that's all.</i>

97
00:08:14,391 --> 00:08:17,517
He's there at your disposal if you need him.

98
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:22,477
Do me a favour,
make him feel like part of the team, hm?

99
00:08:23,227 --> 00:08:25,769
Talk soon.

100
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:30,478
- What?
- She's bringing someone in.

101
00:08:30,562 --> 00:08:33,729
- What does that mean?
- Something in her tone changed.

102
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:36,188
You think she knows about the kid?

103
00:08:36,272 --> 00:08:38,689
We don't know that.

104
00:08:38,772 --> 00:08:41,314
We shouldn't have told her we had the kid.

105
00:08:41,398 --> 00:08:45,815
What is it you don't understand? We tell her
that kid got away, we are not here now.

106
00:08:45,898 --> 00:08:51,275
- I swear to God, it gets deeper and deeper.
- What is that supposed to mean?

107
00:08:51,358 --> 00:08:54,317
It means, if I'd have known
how this was gonna turn out,

108
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:57,527
I'd have got some crap job with the feds.
Pushed pencils.

109
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:02,361
Drank coffee all day long behind a desk.
God, that sounds good.

110
00:09:02,444 --> 00:09:07,320
Keep talking like that, I'm gonna be forced
to put a bullet in your head.

111
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:14,197
As for her friend, whoever that is,

112
00:09:14,281 --> 00:09:19,156
we find out what he wants,
we play nice, we deal with it accordingly.

113
00:09:21,741 --> 00:09:23,950
Michael, you better see this.

114
00:09:30,326 --> 00:09:33,868
<i>Jersey! Are you putting
that carpet in the guards' room?</i>

115
00:09:33,952 --> 00:09:36,161
Yeah, I think so.

116
00:09:36,245 --> 00:09:39,578
- When?
- We gotta tear up the old stuff first.

117
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:43,247
As soon as we're done with that.
Tonight, tomorrow maybe.

118
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:47,414
They're gonna find it, bro.
They're gonna find the hole.

119
00:09:47,497 --> 00:09:49,789
We gotta do something.

120
00:10:01,542 --> 00:10:04,127
Linc. Chow.

121
00:10:08,794 --> 00:10:12,712
- What's this?
- It's for, you know...

122
00:10:12,795 --> 00:10:14,713
your last meal.

123
00:10:14,796 --> 00:10:17,379
Write down what you want.

124
00:10:23,755 --> 00:10:26,840
Linc, you gotta write something down.

125
00:10:26,923 --> 00:10:30,049
I ain't gotta do nothin'.

126
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:37,300
If you don't fill it out, all they're gonna
give you is what's on chow for that day.

127
00:10:37,384 --> 00:10:41,384
- So?
- You don't want that for your last meal, man.

128
00:10:41,467 --> 00:10:43,011
Hm?

129
00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:53,971
In case you think of something.

130
00:11:10,308 --> 00:11:12,393
Hey, Eyetie.

131
00:11:15,852 --> 00:11:18,810
Something you need there, rug head?

132
00:11:19,853 --> 00:11:22,270
Yeah, ajob, man.

133
00:11:22,353 --> 00:11:25,895
Why don't you hit the DQ down the street?
We're not hiring.

134
00:11:25,979 --> 00:11:29,187
I'll put a hundred in your kick every month.

135
00:11:30,313 --> 00:11:32,397
You wanna pay me to work?

136
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,940
I've been in the kitchen for eight months.
I scrub one more tray, I'm gonna go j cat.

137
00:11:38,023 --> 00:11:40,107
Hey! Fiorello, how about it?

138
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,941
Yeah, yeah.

139
00:11:42,525 --> 00:11:44,401
150.

140
00:11:46,109 --> 00:11:48,609
Sign me up, then, baby.

141
00:11:57,653 --> 00:12:00,029
I was thinking about what you said -

142
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,363
that it's not a me-versus-you thing,

143
00:12:03,447 --> 00:12:06,447
it's an us thing.

144
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:09,698
- That's right.
- How far are you willing to go with that?

145
00:12:09,781 --> 00:12:14,199
- As far as I have to.
- Then set up a meeting with Falzone.

146
00:12:14,283 --> 00:12:16,949
I wanna talk to him directly.

147
00:12:18,116 --> 00:12:21,160
Falzone doesn't talk to guys like you directly.

148
00:12:21,243 --> 00:12:24,785
If he wants Fibonacci, he's gonna have to.

149
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,210
No, no. No, you heard me right.

150
00:12:33,293 --> 00:12:36,336
<i>This kid is gonna give up
Fibonacci? Sure?</i>

151
00:12:36,419 --> 00:12:41,003
I'm definite. Only one thing,
he wants to meet with you directly.

152
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:45,213
<i>Son of a bitch. You actually did
something right. That's good.</i>

153
00:12:45,296 --> 00:12:50,089
<i>Guess I'll have to call off 
those guys I hired to shank you.</i>

154
00:12:50,172 --> 00:12:53,172
<i>- That was a joke, John.
- Funny.</i>

155
00:12:53,255 --> 00:12:55,632
<i>Good. I'll come out there this afternoon.</i>

156
00:12:55,715 --> 00:13:00,174
<i>And, John, if I come all the way out there
and this turns out to be a waste of my time,</i>

157
00:13:00,257 --> 00:13:03,591
<i>I'm gonna castrate you.
I hope you understand that.</i>

158
00:13:03,675 --> 00:13:06,843
<i>- Be well, my friend.
- I love you too.</i>

159
00:13:13,136 --> 00:13:15,345
He's coming.

160
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:17,679
Don't mess this up.

161
00:13:47,103 --> 00:13:49,978
- Hello?
- It's me.

162
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:52,687
I know. I saw "Inmate" on the caller ID.

163
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:55,939
Remember when I said
I might be calling you on Fibonacci?

164
00:13:56,021 --> 00:14:00,898
<i>- Yes.
- Well... it's time.</i>

165
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:05,774
- You seem distracted.
- Got a lot on my mind, I guess.

166
00:14:05,857 --> 00:14:07,607
Yeah?

167
00:14:07,691 --> 00:14:10,942
Have anything to do with
the people who took these toes?

168
00:14:11,025 --> 00:14:13,567
- Nice flowers.
- Right.

169
00:14:14,275 --> 00:14:17,526
- Do we have an admirer?
- They're from my father.

170
00:14:17,609 --> 00:14:18,901
Ah.

171
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:21,820
- What's the occasion?
- It's my birthday.

172
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:24,820
- Today?
- Mm-hm.

173
00:14:24,903 --> 00:14:27,861
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

174
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,571
OK.

175
00:14:31,655 --> 00:14:33,738
Huh.

176
00:14:33,822 --> 00:14:39,073
Nothing. Birthday's aren't usually
a sore subject, that's all.

177
00:14:39,156 --> 00:14:42,157
Unless the celebrant is feeling her age,

178
00:14:42,241 --> 00:14:45,658
which I don't see how you could be.

179
00:14:45,741 --> 00:14:49,867
I'm 29 years old, Michael.
I'm not feeling my age.

180
00:14:49,951 --> 00:14:53,577
It's just, out of those 29 birthdays,
my father has managed to see me

181
00:14:53,661 --> 00:14:56,828
on precisely six of them.

182
00:14:56,911 --> 00:15:00,578
So, I get flowers instead.

183
00:15:00,662 --> 00:15:05,079
Flowers that end up dead
and in the trash a week later.

184
00:15:05,162 --> 00:15:08,872
- That sounded bitter, huh?
- Kind of.

185
00:15:08,956 --> 00:15:12,706
It's not a big deal.
You are all set. I will see you tomorrow.

186
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:15,041
OK.

187
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,667
I'm sorry you feel that way.

188
00:15:20,499 --> 00:15:22,750
About the flowers, I mean.

189
00:15:29,752 --> 00:15:33,670
- Hey, I want these in the other room.
- I got it, boss.

190
00:15:33,753 --> 00:15:36,586
Hey, chill, lily white. I got it.

191
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:03,260
Come on,
I know you're around here somewhere.

192
00:16:32,851 --> 00:16:37,726
<i>- He's not doing well, is he?
- He just lost his mother.</i>

193
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:41,102
Ten days from now, he loses his father.

194
00:16:49,146 --> 00:16:51,771
<i>How are you holding up?</i>

195
00:16:55,772 --> 00:16:58,274
You know, I...

196
00:16:58,357 --> 00:17:02,524
I sort of get
what you're going through here, LJ.

197
00:17:03,692 --> 00:17:07,483
No disrespect, but I don't know that you do.

198
00:17:07,567 --> 00:17:09,818
No, with my dad,

199
00:17:09,901 --> 00:17:13,235
I was in the same spot when I was your age.

200
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:18,444
He was in prison,
and like your dad, he was innocent.

201
00:17:18,528 --> 00:17:23,071
What happened?
I mean, you know, at the end.

202
00:17:23,154 --> 00:17:26,364
What I hope happens here -
he got exonerated.

203
00:17:28,155 --> 00:17:32,364
- What did they say he did?
- A lot of bad things.

204
00:17:32,447 --> 00:17:36,157
They weren't true, and we proved that.

205
00:17:36,241 --> 00:17:40,075
Every day. Every day was a lost cause,
but we kept fighting.

206
00:17:40,158 --> 00:17:45,326
I mean, what else are you gonna do when you
love somebody? Let them go out like that?

207
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:48,785
So you fight. You keep fighting.

208
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:51,536
You never give up.

209
00:17:53,786 --> 00:17:56,037
We're gonna beat this thing.

210
00:17:56,121 --> 00:17:57,621
OK?

211
00:18:06,164 --> 00:18:08,291
- Hello.
- Hello.

212
00:18:08,374 --> 00:18:11,374
You were expecting me?
A mutual friend arranged it.

213
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:13,917
- Yes.
- You mind if I?

214
00:18:14,001 --> 00:18:15,792
Please.

215
00:18:16,834 --> 00:18:18,668
Hey, how are...

216
00:18:22,752 --> 00:18:26,044
<i>- I'm sorry, I didn't get your name.
- Quinn.</i>

217
00:18:26,128 --> 00:18:29,379
Mr Quinn,
mind telling us what we're doing here?

218
00:18:29,462 --> 00:18:33,422
You can probably tell just by looking at me,
I'm not a wave-making sort.

219
00:18:33,504 --> 00:18:36,380
Just think of me as a supervisor

220
00:18:36,463 --> 00:18:41,172
who's here to make sure things are under
control as we approach... the big event.

221
00:18:41,256 --> 00:18:44,048
I wasn't aware that things were out of control.

222
00:18:44,132 --> 00:18:48,341
Well, you'd be the one that would know,
wouldn't you?

223
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:56,011
Well, the reason I'm here is because
there's a discrepancy between what you know

224
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:58,552
and what you have said to the vice president.

225
00:18:58,635 --> 00:19:02,553
The lawyers you tried to blow up
are still healthy as thoroughbreds.

226
00:19:02,636 --> 00:19:06,680
You know it, I know it.
Same thing goes with the kid,

227
00:19:06,763 --> 00:19:11,973
who you were silly enough to tell the old lady
that you were actually in possession of.

228
00:19:12,056 --> 00:19:15,223
Everything that I'm saying
is boiling down to this.

229
00:19:15,306 --> 00:19:20,641
You gotta hand the reins over to me now,
so that I can save your ass.

230
00:19:25,642 --> 00:19:28,142
First of all...

231
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:30,685
No! No.

232
00:19:30,768 --> 00:19:33,935
See, now you made me make a wave.

233
00:19:35,602 --> 00:19:38,728
You and your partner are off the job
until further notice.

234
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:41,604
It doesn't come from me
or from the White House -

235
00:19:41,688 --> 00:19:45,397
it comes from the company. You understand?

236
00:19:54,066 --> 00:19:58,900
Your proximal and middle phalanx are
broken. Ice it for 45 minutes then splint it.

237
00:19:58,984 --> 00:20:05,109
That's what a doctor would tell you to do,
so you don't need to go see one.

238
00:20:21,864 --> 00:20:23,739
EcoField's SEC filings.

239
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:28,323
Steadman was murdered so information
from his indictment wouldn't be public.

240
00:20:28,407 --> 00:20:32,616
Sure, but we have no way of knowing
what they were trying to cover up.

241
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,741
Steadman's wife said there were
hundreds of millions of dollars at stake.

242
00:20:36,825 --> 00:20:40,660
So I figure we follow the money
and see where it takes us.

243
00:20:40,743 --> 00:20:43,411
109 million, 212 million.

244
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:46,036
Over half a billion dollars I've found so far

245
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,745
in federal grants to EcoField
for alternative fuel research.

246
00:20:49,829 --> 00:20:52,080
- That is a hell of a lot.
- But for what?

247
00:20:52,164 --> 00:20:54,746
Not only did the company
never make a profit,

248
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:57,621
as far as I can tell, they never made anything.

249
00:20:57,705 --> 00:21:00,665
No fuel sales, no patents,
no findings, nothing.

250
00:21:00,748 --> 00:21:03,081
So EcoField was a sham. It was a cover.

251
00:21:03,165 --> 00:21:05,958
The question is, for what?

252
00:21:17,544 --> 00:21:19,627
Philly.

253
00:21:22,455 --> 00:21:24,747
Sit down, kid.

254
00:21:30,082 --> 00:21:31,957
So...

255
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,999
Fibonacci - how'd you find him?

256
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:37,834
I did my homework.

257
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:44,544
You get elliptical with me
for one more second and I will cancel you.

258
00:21:44,628 --> 00:21:48,337
- You understand me?
- Give it up, fish.

259
00:21:50,213 --> 00:21:54,296
Before someone's transferred to the marshals
and placed in protection,

260
00:21:54,380 --> 00:22:00,090
they're guarded by a local sheriff
from the county where the trial will take place.

261
00:22:03,006 --> 00:22:06,632
<i>- Sheriff Solomon, please.
- Please hold.</i>

262
00:22:07,674 --> 00:22:10,550
<i>Andrew Solomon here.</i>

263
00:22:13,217 --> 00:22:17,676
<i>If the sheriff was available,
he wasn't the one guarding Fibonacci.</i>

264
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,887
<i>- Putnam County Sheriff's Office.
- Yeah, is Sheriff Pronzo there?</i>

265
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:24,929
<i>I'm sorry. Sheriff Pronzo's on vacation.</i>

266
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:27,013
<i>- Really?
- Yes, sir.</i>

267
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:29,679
There are only four sheriffs in the county.

268
00:22:29,763 --> 00:22:34,597
Since Pronzo was the only one not in his
office, and his wife and kids were at home,

269
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,931
I knew the only vacation
he was taking was with Fibonacci.

270
00:22:38,014 --> 00:22:41,474
Watching him
till they could put him in protection.

271
00:22:41,557 --> 00:22:45,809
Thing is, sometimes it takes weeks
for the marshals to set up a new identity,

272
00:22:45,892 --> 00:22:50,309
so some local sheriff is stuck
in the middle of nowhere with Fibonacci.

273
00:22:50,392 --> 00:22:54,560
He gets Ionely and calls home - a lot.

274
00:22:57,062 --> 00:23:01,896
<i>I called the phone company,
said I was Pronzo and I'd lost my bill.</i>

275
00:23:01,979 --> 00:23:04,145
<i>I asked for another copy.</i>

276
00:23:05,188 --> 00:23:11,189
<i>Mrs Pronzo was receiving dozens of calls
from an area code a long way from Chicago.</i>

277
00:23:12,607 --> 00:23:16,774
I went online,
reverse-traced the number, and voilà:

278
00:23:16,857 --> 00:23:19,982
There was Fibonacci's exact location.

279
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:23,984
- How do you know he's still there?
- I have someone looking after him.

280
00:23:24,068 --> 00:23:27,860
- Watching from afar, in case he moves.
- Mm-hm.

281
00:23:30,985 --> 00:23:34,445
- This is about money, isn't it?
- You're an astute man.

282
00:23:34,529 --> 00:23:38,655
- What?
- Your friend here is trying to extort me.

283
00:23:38,738 --> 00:23:43,239
Not extortion, insurance.
I plan on being out of here one day.

284
00:23:43,322 --> 00:23:47,073
I don't think my new résumé
is gonna cut it in most places.

285
00:23:47,156 --> 00:23:49,366
- How much?
- 200,000.

286
00:23:50,783 --> 00:23:54,116
<i>- I'm gonna kill you.
- Quid pro quo.</i>

287
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,743
You scratch my back, I scratch yours.

288
00:23:56,824 --> 00:24:00,202
<i>Well, I'll give you some quid pro quo.</i>

289
00:24:03,285 --> 00:24:06,203
<i>Where did you get this?</i>

290
00:24:07,744 --> 00:24:08,787
Who took this?

291
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:13,329
Since you took it upon yourself to have
people watch our interests on the outside,

292
00:24:13,412 --> 00:24:17,206
we took it upon ourselves
to have some people watching yours.

293
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:22,916
So who's it gonna be?
Fibonacci or your pretty little girlfriend there?

294
00:24:36,033 --> 00:24:43,077
Yeah, you should be careful with who
visits you in here, fish. These walls have eyes.

295
00:24:43,334 --> 00:24:45,834
If you touch her,

296
00:24:45,918 --> 00:24:48,752
I'll kill you myself.

297
00:24:48,835 --> 00:24:53,212
One, that is an empty threat.
You are less than a gnat to me.

298
00:24:53,295 --> 00:24:56,671
And two,
all you gotta do is give me the address

299
00:24:56,754 --> 00:24:59,505
and we avoid all this melodrama altogether.

300
00:25:04,506 --> 00:25:07,673
The address, you gnat.

301
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:10,007
Now.

302
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,841
Promise me...

303
00:25:16,383 --> 00:25:18,926
promise me it'll be quick and painless.

304
00:25:19,593 --> 00:25:21,842
- Do you believe this guy?
- Promise me.

305
00:25:21,926 --> 00:25:27,344
If the next thing that comes out
of your mouth is not that address,

306
00:25:27,427 --> 00:25:30,929
there's gonna be a lot of pain...
in a lot of places.

307
00:25:43,265 --> 00:25:45,683
Canada.

308
00:25:46,724 --> 00:25:49,849
345 Hamilton Avenue,

309
00:25:50,976 --> 00:25:52,893
Thunder Bay, Ontario.

310
00:25:52,977 --> 00:25:55,142
Get outta here.

311
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,064
Nice work, John.

312
00:26:14,438 --> 00:26:19,856
I guess the demise of John Abruzzi
was greatly exaggerated.

313
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,525
Thank you. I appreciate it.

314
00:26:22,608 --> 00:26:26,234
Could you do me a favour
and fix this Bellick thing for me?

315
00:26:26,692 --> 00:26:29,568
Yeah, consider it done.

316
00:26:30,859 --> 00:26:33,277
Thank you. And Philly.

317
00:26:33,361 --> 00:26:35,860
Before you pull the trigger,

318
00:26:35,944 --> 00:26:42,071
look that son of a bitch in his eyes
and tell him John Abruzzi said goodbye.

319
00:27:12,327 --> 00:27:16,955
"In the race toward worldwide peace
and prosperity, America will set the pace."

320
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:20,163
"Race"? Rat race, arms race...

321
00:27:20,247 --> 00:27:23,163
Can you think of a word
with a worse connotation?

322
00:27:23,247 --> 00:27:25,790
Fix it.

323
00:27:25,873 --> 00:27:28,373
<i>Did you send me a baby-sitter?</i>

324
00:27:29,665 --> 00:27:33,332
- This is not the time or the place.
- This is the time and the place.

325
00:27:33,416 --> 00:27:36,543
Don't take that tone.
Remember who you are talking to.

326
00:27:36,625 --> 00:27:38,750
I am vice president of this country.

327
00:27:38,834 --> 00:27:43,628
No, actually you're Caroline Reynolds
from Montgomery, Illinois.

328
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:46,044
I know exactly who you are.

329
00:27:48,295 --> 00:27:50,837
Come with me.

330
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,004
Just...

331
00:27:57,464 --> 00:28:00,047
There is something you need to understand.

332
00:28:00,131 --> 00:28:03,966
If you had done yourjob,
I never would've had to ask for Quinn.

333
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:07,174
And there's something
you need to understand.

334
00:28:07,258 --> 00:28:10,842
You woke a sleeping beast
when you called these guys in.

335
00:28:10,925 --> 00:28:15,384
They have a bigger agenda than us and get
nasty quick if things don't go their way.

336
00:28:15,467 --> 00:28:17,802
So now no one is safe -

337
00:28:17,885 --> 00:28:20,552
not you, not me.

338
00:28:21,803 --> 00:28:28,012
Let's not overreact. I mean, I know everyone
is nervous about tomorrow. I understand that.

339
00:28:28,096 --> 00:28:33,889
But the one thing both of us have to
remember is that we are in this together, OK?

340
00:28:33,973 --> 00:28:38,765
All I'm saying is these guys are into this thing
now, and there's no going back.

341
00:28:38,849 --> 00:28:42,516
That's bad news for everyone.

342
00:28:56,786 --> 00:28:58,995
Sebastian Balfour?

343
00:29:00,495 --> 00:29:02,621
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'm Nestor Pollack.

344
00:29:02,705 --> 00:29:05,121
Midwestern Life and Casualty.

345
00:29:05,204 --> 00:29:07,747
I'm already covered. Thanks.

346
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:11,581
- No, I'm here to discuss Veronica Donovan.
- What about her?

347
00:29:11,664 --> 00:29:17,249
We've been trying to track her down with
respect to the damage from the explosion.

348
00:29:17,332 --> 00:29:21,667
- Explosion?
- You didn't know. Oh, I'm sorry.

349
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:26,167
It's just that her records,
they list you as her fiancé, so I assumed...

350
00:29:26,251 --> 00:29:30,377
- Hold on. Is Veronica OK?
- Well, there has been a fatality.

351
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:36,294
But the medical examiners haven't been able
to identify the remains with any certainty,

352
00:29:36,378 --> 00:29:41,546
so Veronica could be OK, we just can't
find her. We were hoping you could help.

353
00:30:11,469 --> 00:30:13,554
Rozz.

354
00:30:15,263 --> 00:30:17,513
Reese.

355
00:30:19,597 --> 00:30:20,931
Burrows.

356
00:30:31,976 --> 00:30:33,976
Blueberry pancakes, huh?

357
00:30:34,059 --> 00:30:36,143
All right, man. You got it.

358
00:30:36,226 --> 00:30:38,268
Blueberry pancakes.

359
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,749
<i>341...</i>

360
00:32:24,502 --> 00:32:26,586
345.

361
00:32:31,004 --> 00:32:34,087
This is it.

362
00:32:34,171 --> 00:32:38,963
All right, that's it, kids.
Time for bed. Give me a kiss.

363
00:32:40,672 --> 00:32:42,965
Are you OK down there?

364
00:32:43,048 --> 00:32:45,549
Night-night.

365
00:32:45,632 --> 00:32:48,717
All right, sweetheart. Give me a kiss.

366
00:33:04,053 --> 00:33:07,178
- The kids are down.
- Thanks.

367
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,972
Tonight we send a message, gentlemen.

368
00:33:12,055 --> 00:33:16,639
We are gonna hurt him and his family
the way he hurt ours.

369
00:33:39,756 --> 00:33:41,881
- Oh, honey.
- Yeah?

370
00:33:41,939 --> 00:33:45,649
- Can you change the timer on the sprinkler?
- OK.

371
00:33:45,733 --> 00:33:47,399
- Love you.
- Love you too.

372
00:33:53,067 --> 00:33:55,484
<i>Freeze!</i>

373
00:33:55,943 --> 00:33:58,610
Police! Drop your weapons!

374
00:33:59,569 --> 00:34:01,236
Drop it!

375
00:34:07,196 --> 00:34:09,279
Down!

376
00:34:34,704 --> 00:34:37,538
Hi, it's John. You wanted to talk to me?

377
00:34:37,621 --> 00:34:39,830
<i>Yeah. You hear the news?</i>

378
00:34:39,913 --> 00:34:42,998
<i>Falzone got popped last night, up in Canada.</i>

379
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:47,374
<i>International gun charges, parole violation...</i>

380
00:34:47,458 --> 00:34:50,124
<i>He's in deep.</i>

381
00:34:54,585 --> 00:34:58,960
- You threw away your flowers.
- Like I said, they don't last.

382
00:34:59,544 --> 00:35:02,544
I don't think they're dead yet.

383
00:35:03,545 --> 00:35:08,045
I don't like getting attached to things
if I know they won't last.

384
00:35:08,129 --> 00:35:12,172
- There you go.
- Why are you so cynical?

385
00:35:13,338 --> 00:35:18,840
- I think there's cynicism and there's realism.
- And there's optimism. Hope, faith.

386
00:35:18,923 --> 00:35:22,215
Coming from an eight-toed guy
locked in a penitentiary?

387
00:35:22,299 --> 00:35:24,966
Toes are overrated.

388
00:35:25,049 --> 00:35:28,176
Thank you for trying to make me smile.
Not today.

389
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:31,427
- You never know.
- We're all set.

390
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:04,475
You and I have a lot to talk about,
don't we, fish?

391
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:08,809
Seems Philly Falzone
ran into some problem up in Canada

392
00:36:08,893 --> 00:36:11,853
just because of the information you gave him.

393
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:16,854
- What kind of trouble?
- International gun charges, parole violation.

394
00:36:16,937 --> 00:36:19,395
He's gonna go away for a long time.

395
00:36:19,478 --> 00:36:22,272
How do you feel about that?

396
00:36:22,355 --> 00:36:25,105
Pretty darn good.

397
00:36:27,857 --> 00:36:31,357
- And what about PI?
- We got that back too.

398
00:36:31,441 --> 00:36:34,734
Falzone paid Bellick yesterday,
so we're good. For now.

399
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:37,066
- It all worked out.
- Sure did.

400
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:40,110
Nicely done. You're a hell of an actor.

401
00:36:40,193 --> 00:36:41,943
Thank you.

402
00:36:42,027 --> 00:36:44,277
This helped. It's nice.

403
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,193
Nice shot.

404
00:36:46,277 --> 00:36:48,612
Where did you take it?

405
00:36:48,695 --> 00:36:52,404
It's Lincoln's from back in the day.
A camping trip or something.

406
00:36:52,487 --> 00:36:55,697
- So when do we get back in that room?
- Right away.

407
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,739
- Well, let's get to it.
- Yeah.

408
00:36:59,864 --> 00:37:02,781
Oh, there's one more thing.

409
00:37:05,616 --> 00:37:11,284
You are gonna give me Fibonacci
once we're outside these walls, right?

410
00:37:11,367 --> 00:37:13,159
Of course.

411
00:37:16,118 --> 00:37:18,493
Thank you.

412
00:37:18,577 --> 00:37:21,369
And I think I'll keep this,

413
00:37:21,453 --> 00:37:24,286
as insurance.

414
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:41,291
<i>- Juice?
- Why can't we have breakfast every day?</i>

415
00:37:41,374 --> 00:37:45,125
You should have breakfast every day, LJ.
It's an important meal.

416
00:37:45,208 --> 00:37:47,959
No, why can't I have breakfast with
you every day?

417
00:37:48,043 --> 00:37:50,376
Nothing would make me happier.

418
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:54,668
But your mommy and me,
we don't live together any more.

419
00:37:54,752 --> 00:37:57,462
Why?

420
00:37:57,545 --> 00:37:59,296
Well, uh...

421
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:03,629
sometimes that happens
with mommies and daddies.

422
00:38:03,713 --> 00:38:06,921
But you know what?
You're the luckiest boy in the world,

423
00:38:07,005 --> 00:38:09,715
because your mommy loves you very much

424
00:38:09,798 --> 00:38:11,964
and I love you very much.

425
00:38:12,048 --> 00:38:16,382
I tell you what, how about every Sunday
we have our own special breakfast?

426
00:38:16,466 --> 00:38:19,633
- Just you and me. Yeah?
- Yeah.

427
00:38:19,717 --> 00:38:21,800
- Little bit or a handful?
- Handful.

428
00:38:21,884 --> 00:38:23,760
Handful.

429
00:38:25,884 --> 00:38:27,968
Here we go.

430
00:38:38,799 --> 00:38:41,632
Take a walk.

431
00:38:45,467 --> 00:38:48,634
Anyone else want to walk with him?

432
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:51,969
Yeah.

433
00:38:54,511 --> 00:38:58,595
- This is my game.
- Looks like our friend got his throne back.

434
00:38:58,678 --> 00:39:01,096
Looks like it.

435
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:05,722
Something tells me
we may have you to thank for that.

436
00:39:05,806 --> 00:39:07,888
- You don't want to know.
- Right.

437
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:11,556
Stretch your legs, old head.

438
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:24,559
Now, we got a hell of a lot
to talk about, don't we?

439
00:39:30,394 --> 00:39:32,728
I got nothing to say.

440
00:39:32,812 --> 00:39:35,354
You think you can play me, snowflake?

441
00:39:35,437 --> 00:39:37,771
Cos you got college?

442
00:39:37,854 --> 00:39:40,146
Big-school learning, huh?

443
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:44,190
Well, let me school you.
Darwin wins inside these walls.

444
00:39:44,772 --> 00:39:47,690
Not Einstein, Darwin.

445
00:39:47,774 --> 00:39:49,942
<i>Yard time's over, ladies.</i>

446
00:39:50,023 --> 00:39:52,566
Let's line it up.

447
00:39:53,775 --> 00:39:56,192
I'm not done with you, fish.

448
00:39:56,275 --> 00:39:58,360
You never even got started.

449
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:20,323
All right.

450
00:40:23,032 --> 00:40:28,033
We're through the hard part.
Another 18 inches, we'll hit that pipe.

451
00:40:28,116 --> 00:40:30,617
- We'll be there by Friday.
- Friday?

452
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:34,451
- Better start making travel arrangements.
- Maricruz, here I come.

453
00:40:34,535 --> 00:40:37,451
<i>- Sardinia.
- Where are we going?</i>

454
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:39,369
- Panama.
- Panama.

455
00:40:39,452 --> 00:40:43,036
Panama. Darien Gap, south of the canal.

456
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,287
No roads, no electricity, no cops.

457
00:40:47,205 --> 00:40:50,872
Nothing but white sand beaches
and ice-cold beer.

458
00:40:50,956 --> 00:40:55,873
- Well, that's nice, but what about our lives?
- Well, we'll open a scuba shop.

459
00:40:55,957 --> 00:40:58,375
- Hey, I don't dive.
- Neither do I.

460
00:40:58,458 --> 00:41:00,916
We'll have plenty of time to learn.

461
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,416
Bulls.

462
00:41:09,417 --> 00:41:12,835
This con says he's on ajob in here.

463
00:41:12,919 --> 00:41:16,169
- I don't think so.
- You heard the paisano. Move your ass.

464
00:41:16,253 --> 00:41:18,921
CO, hold on one second.

465
00:41:25,171 --> 00:41:29,715
Now, are you sure about that?
Are you sure you can't use an extra hand?

466
00:41:29,799 --> 00:41:32,590
You know anything about construction?

467
00:41:32,674 --> 00:41:36,216
Concrete is my specialty. Can you dig it?

468
00:41:39,926 --> 00:41:41,968
OK, boss. Sign him up.

469
00:41:42,051 --> 00:41:44,635
You got it.

470
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:56,720
Now it looks like Darwin wins after all,
eh, fish?

471
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:06,933
I have a lot of dots,
but no way to connect them.

472
00:42:07,014 --> 00:42:09,933
- Nobody's getting rich.
- What about shareholders?

473
00:42:10,016 --> 00:42:12,641
Profits were all converted back to shares.

474
00:42:12,724 --> 00:42:15,518
Looks like they subcontracted out
some research -

475
00:42:15,601 --> 00:42:19,267
it's pennies in the scheme of things.
Nobody got early retirement.

476
00:42:19,351 --> 00:42:22,935
But you can't hide $500 million
by moving a few decimal points.

477
00:42:23,018 --> 00:42:28,561
<i>In a move anticipated by many, Reynolds
announced she is running for the presidency.</i>

478
00:42:28,645 --> 00:42:32,063
<i>She made the announcement
from her hometown of Montgomery.</i>

479
00:42:32,146 --> 00:42:37,982
<i>The move toward worldwide peace
and prosperity is a marathon, not a sprint,</i>

480
00:42:38,065 --> 00:42:42,732
<i>but I assure you,
America will be setting the pace.</i>

481
00:42:42,816 --> 00:42:46,775
$0.5 billion doesn't disappear.
You could run a small country with that.

482
00:42:46,858 --> 00:42:51,275
<i>The vice president is reported to have
the largest campaign war chest in history.</i>

483
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:54,943
<i>It is so large, in fact,
prognosticators are already casting her</i>

484
00:42:55,026 --> 00:42:57,736
<i>as the favourite in the presidential race.</i>

485
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:00,736
Maybe not a small country.

486
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:03,404
Maybe this one.
