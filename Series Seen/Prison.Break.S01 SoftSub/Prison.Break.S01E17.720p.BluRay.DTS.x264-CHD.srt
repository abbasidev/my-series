1
00:00:01,021 --> 00:00:03,010
<i>Previously on Prison Break.</i>

2
00:00:08,821 --> 00:00:10,014
Did you see the guy in the viewing room?

3
00:00:10,121 --> 00:00:11,246
No.

4
00:00:11,354 --> 00:00:12,910
It was Dad.

5
00:00:14,821 --> 00:00:16,151
I know that guy.

6
00:00:23,454 --> 00:00:24,477
What is it?

7
00:00:24,587 --> 00:00:26,416
It was fused into Michael Scofield's skin.

8
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,009
- Where'd it come from?
- As far as I can tell, a guard's uniform.

9
00:00:30,121 --> 00:00:31,144
<i>What's wrong?</i>

10
00:00:31,253 --> 00:00:32,219
The blueprints,

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,150
the ones we need to get
from the psych ward to the infirmary,

12
00:00:35,253 --> 00:00:36,446
they're gone.

13
00:00:46,787 --> 00:00:48,582
Hey, that's looking good.

14
00:00:49,573 --> 00:00:51,402
You're making some real progress.

15
00:00:51,507 --> 00:00:53,063
The plaster adds a lot of weight.

16
00:00:53,173 --> 00:00:54,833
I may have to add reinforcements.

17
00:00:54,939 --> 00:00:57,872
Whatever it takes, as long as you get done
in time for the anniversary.

18
00:00:57,973 --> 00:00:59,905
It'll be done. Hold this.

19
00:01:01,273 --> 00:01:03,671
You know, the Shah loved his Taj so much

20
00:01:03,773 --> 00:01:06,637
that he built another temple
just like it on the other side of the river.

21
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,205
It was an absolute mirror image.

22
00:01:08,306 --> 00:01:11,170
Except it was darker,
it was like a black Taj Mahal.

23
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:13,033
Never heard of it.

24
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,129
Well, that's 'cause it was never completed.

25
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,728
He was overthrown by his favorite son
before he could finish it.

26
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:23,930
- Sounds like a myth.
- No, it's 100% true.

27
00:01:24,273 --> 00:01:25,239
I think.

28
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:29,167
Excuse me, Warden.
Dr. Tancredi is here to see you.

29
00:01:29,572 --> 00:01:30,538
Thank you.

30
00:01:33,273 --> 00:01:36,500
Adams, please escort Mr. Scofield
back to his cell.

31
00:01:40,906 --> 00:01:44,998
- Doctor, what can I do for you?
- Actually, it's about Scofield, sir.

32
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:47,498
Come in.

33
00:01:53,173 --> 00:01:56,969
- What about Scofield?
- The burn on his back is fairly serious.

34
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,200
He seems to be recovering.

35
00:02:00,205 --> 00:02:02,694
At first, I assumed
he was being assaulted by another inmate,

36
00:02:02,806 --> 00:02:04,772
but I found this embedded
in the skin on his back.

37
00:02:04,873 --> 00:02:07,532
- What's this?
- It's fabric.

38
00:02:08,506 --> 00:02:10,301
Came from a guard's uniform.

39
00:02:25,506 --> 00:02:26,937
What are you doing?

40
00:02:27,038 --> 00:02:29,732
I'm trying to remember those blueprints,

41
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,205
what we lost to the burn.

44
00:02:37,372 --> 00:02:39,667
- Any luck?
- No.

45
00:02:42,038 --> 00:02:44,936
I spent a lot of time
studying those blueprints,

46
00:02:45,305 --> 00:02:47,736
<i>tracing them night after night,</i>

47
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:51,333
<i>considering every possible route
to the infirmary.</i>

48
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:55,469
It's like trying to take a test
you studied for 10 years ago.

49
00:03:02,972 --> 00:03:04,097
PI!

50
00:03:15,805 --> 00:03:18,896
- How do they get like that, I got no idea.
- I do.

51
00:03:19,005 --> 00:03:22,232
- Tugging on too many pockets.
- She tug on your pocket?

52
00:03:22,338 --> 00:03:26,202
I may be social, but that's
the boundary line even I won't cross.

53
00:03:28,972 --> 00:03:30,938
So how about it, Fish?
When we rolling out?

54
00:03:31,038 --> 00:03:34,060
- One hiccup left, but I'm working on it.
- Yeah, and what is that?

55
00:03:34,171 --> 00:03:36,899
Our road map's
a little incomplete at the moment.

56
00:03:39,338 --> 00:03:41,929
I don't get it.
Why not just go down there again?

57
00:03:42,037 --> 00:03:44,299
'Cause, one, I don't have
the guard's uniform anymore,

58
00:03:44,404 --> 00:03:47,097
which means I can't get across the yard
or past the orderly.

59
00:03:47,204 --> 00:03:50,500
And two, even if I did,
it's a mess down there.

60
00:03:51,804 --> 00:03:53,100
I need this.

61
00:03:53,204 --> 00:03:56,637
- You think you're gonna remember it?
- Not with you hounding me.

62
00:04:01,505 --> 00:04:02,993
Time to wrap it up.

63
00:04:03,104 --> 00:04:04,763
We're going to
have you start exterminating.

64
00:04:04,871 --> 00:04:06,860
- We're not done in here.
- Well, you look done to me.

65
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:09,403
No, CO,
we still got the carpet to do, man.

66
00:04:09,505 --> 00:04:11,800
No, Bellick is going to bring
professionals in to do that.

67
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,870
Wants the job done right.

68
00:04:14,537 --> 00:04:16,867
- When's that going to happen?
- Tomorrow.

69
00:04:23,404 --> 00:04:25,961
We got a real problem
on our hands, don't we?

70
00:04:26,371 --> 00:04:28,700
Rug monkeys gonna come
in here, tear up that carpet

71
00:04:28,804 --> 00:04:30,633
and that hole's gonna
be smiling up at them.

72
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,828
- We'll have to fill it in.
- We just dug that bitch.

73
00:04:32,937 --> 00:04:34,368
All we need is a piece of plywood

74
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:37,402
and a couple inches of that
fast-setting concrete on top of it.

75
00:04:37,504 --> 00:04:39,697
The carpet guys will never know
there's anything beneath it.

76
00:04:39,804 --> 00:04:41,202
And the night we break out,

77
00:04:41,303 --> 00:04:43,895
we'll just smash through
with a sledgehammer.

78
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:48,700
Well, okay. Let's get on it.

79
00:04:48,804 --> 00:04:51,326
We've only got a couple hours
to get this thing done.

80
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,955
Hey, Tweener. You met Avocado?

81
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,722
Yo, what's up?

82
00:05:03,526 --> 00:05:06,583
Lookit. She's just a baby.

83
00:05:08,426 --> 00:05:09,722
Hit road.

84
00:05:14,593 --> 00:05:15,718
Have a seat.

85
00:05:21,293 --> 00:05:22,259
So...

86
00:05:23,093 --> 00:05:24,354
Scofield.

87
00:05:24,693 --> 00:05:26,181
What's the 911?

88
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:30,589
It's 411, and I don't know, man.
I ain't up in his car.

89
00:05:31,293 --> 00:05:33,122
You know, Avocado's looking for a new cellie.

90
00:05:33,226 --> 00:05:35,454
Boss, come on, man,
I'm trying to break bread with the man,

91
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,287
but I can't get jack
unless I can get to the table.

92
00:05:38,393 --> 00:05:39,949
You know what I'm saying?

93
00:05:40,059 --> 00:05:43,457
Scofield got his own peeps up in PI.
He don't need me.

94
00:05:47,426 --> 00:05:50,585
- How long this stuff take to dry?
- One, two hours.

95
00:05:51,792 --> 00:05:53,122
Fire on the line.

96
00:06:15,325 --> 00:06:16,882
This place is sweet.

97
00:06:16,993 --> 00:06:18,356
I heard we're getting satellite.

98
00:06:18,459 --> 00:06:22,118
- Yeah, all the porn you can watch, boss.
- Good, good.

99
00:06:22,292 --> 00:06:24,258
You know, you girls
have done such a good job,

100
00:06:24,359 --> 00:06:27,587
I thought you could use
an extra pair of hands on the crew.

101
00:06:37,692 --> 00:06:38,987
What's up?

102
00:06:41,877 --> 00:06:46,977


103
00:07:22,888 --> 00:07:25,854
Hey, man, look at my brush.
It's all sticking together.

104
00:07:25,955 --> 00:07:28,114
Somebody needs to go clean them out.

105
00:07:29,188 --> 00:07:33,518
According to rank, that would be you.

106
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:37,152
What do I gotta do?

107
00:07:37,254 --> 00:07:40,584
There's a hose out by the shed in the yard.
You can use that.

108
00:07:45,054 --> 00:07:46,384
Clean those, too.

109
00:07:49,421 --> 00:07:50,580
All right.

110
00:07:52,021 --> 00:07:54,317
Sorry I busted up the party, yo.

111
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,307
Who is he?

112
00:08:15,417 --> 00:08:16,973
For your purposes, all you need to know

113
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:19,345
is that man in the photo
used to work for the Company.

114
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:20,541
He went rogue.

115
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,639
And how's he involved in this situation?

116
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,341
He's Burrows' father.

117
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,572
Wait, wait, wait.

118
00:08:26,683 --> 00:08:30,740
You picked the son of a Company man
to be our patsy? Did the Company know?

119
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:33,873
The Company did know.
That was the whole point.

120
00:08:34,317 --> 00:08:35,714
How about you elaborate on that?

121
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:38,282
How about you
stop with all the questions?

122
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:41,975
You are a glorified bodyguard, that's it.

123
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:45,742
Your job's to be seen, not to be heard.
Is that understood?

124
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:56,208
- How close are we?
- Oh, we're good to go, baby.

125
00:08:56,683 --> 00:08:58,013
Got another badge.

126
00:08:58,249 --> 00:08:59,943
What is this, happy hour?

127
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:14,712
Scofield? Pope wants to see you.

128
00:09:14,982 --> 00:09:17,244
The rest of you round up,
you're done in here.

129
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:20,577
Hey, CO Patterson said
we had till the end of the day to finish up.

130
00:09:20,683 --> 00:09:21,978
And I say you're done.

131
00:09:22,082 --> 00:09:25,844
There's a couple hours of work
I want done in the yard before sundown.

132
00:09:27,116 --> 00:09:28,446
Come on, let's go.

133
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:33,445
- We're dead.
- We're not. I'll get it done.

134
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,742
- It's gotta be done tonight.
- I said I'll get it done.

135
00:09:35,849 --> 00:09:37,815
Scofield, Pope's waiting.

136
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,212
Hey, Linc.

137
00:09:47,982 --> 00:09:49,346
You going to let me out?

138
00:09:49,449 --> 00:09:52,313
No, Linc, just came to let you know
they set a new date.

139
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,643
DOC refiled all the paperwork.

140
00:09:54,749 --> 00:09:56,715
Execution's a week from Friday
at midnight.

141
00:09:56,815 --> 00:09:58,213
You going to let me out in the yard
or what?

142
00:09:58,316 --> 00:10:00,713
Unless I hear it from the Pope himself,
I can't do it. I'm sorry.

143
00:10:00,815 --> 00:10:02,838
Come on, man, 10 minutes.
That's all I'm asking.

144
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:04,313
Ten minutes.

145
00:10:05,316 --> 00:10:06,747
I'm sorry.

146
00:10:12,016 --> 00:10:13,914
Some guy just walks into the courtroom,

147
00:10:14,016 --> 00:10:17,073
drops off some medical records,
Lincoln gets a stay of execution,

148
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:19,149
then "poof," he disappears into the cold.

149
00:10:19,248 --> 00:10:22,442
Who do you think it could be,
some anti-death penalty fanatic?

150
00:10:22,549 --> 00:10:24,538
Oh, come on, in this case, I doubt it.

151
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:27,308
But without a name or a paper trail,
we got no way of getting to him.

152
00:10:27,415 --> 00:10:29,210
So once again we have nothing.

153
00:10:29,315 --> 00:10:32,076
I wouldn't exactly call
a two-week stay nothing, okay?

154
00:10:32,182 --> 00:10:33,478
It's more than we had yesterday.

155
00:10:33,582 --> 00:10:35,241
Can I ask you a question?

156
00:10:35,348 --> 00:10:38,007
Do you really think that
you're going to get to the bottom of this?

157
00:10:38,115 --> 00:10:39,877
That they'll let you
get to the bottom of this?

158
00:10:39,981 --> 00:10:41,947
These guys don't exist.

159
00:10:42,048 --> 00:10:45,378
You go after them with the law,
and they'll just use it against you.

160
00:10:45,482 --> 00:10:47,845
We're doing the best we can, okay?

161
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:50,574
Law's the only way we're going
to bring them to justice, LJ.

162
00:10:50,682 --> 00:10:52,375
They gunned my mother down, man.

163
00:10:52,482 --> 00:10:54,380
You think I give a damn about justice?

164
00:10:54,482 --> 00:10:56,913
I want them.
I wanna do to them what they did to me.

165
00:10:57,015 --> 00:10:58,208
Come on, LJ.

166
00:10:58,582 --> 00:10:59,945
It's for the courts to decide, not us.

167
00:11:00,048 --> 00:11:01,378
Look, they're going to slip up, okay?

168
00:11:01,482 --> 00:11:03,913
They're going to leave a piece of evidence
that can't be refuted.

169
00:11:04,015 --> 00:11:07,106
And we're going to be waiting
to nail them when they do.

170
00:11:09,248 --> 00:11:11,441
Maybe they already slipped up.

171
00:11:12,415 --> 00:11:14,278
Up at the cabin, at the well.

172
00:11:14,981 --> 00:11:15,947
Quinn.

173
00:11:18,015 --> 00:11:21,345
- Somebody covered it up.
- They must have come and gotten him.

174
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:23,972
There's only one way to find out.

175
00:11:35,548 --> 00:11:37,411
Look, there's his cell phone.

176
00:11:41,748 --> 00:11:42,805
Easy.

177
00:11:47,115 --> 00:11:48,876
Okay, a little lower!

178
00:11:49,447 --> 00:11:50,913
A little more.

179
00:11:57,814 --> 00:11:59,302
Okay, I got it.

180
00:12:08,447 --> 00:12:09,413
You okay?

181
00:12:10,114 --> 00:12:11,603
Yeah, I'm fine.

182
00:12:14,014 --> 00:12:15,105
Pull me up.

183
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,769
Would you give us a minute, Gary?

184
00:12:32,537 --> 00:12:35,798
Michael, I want you to be
absolutely honest with me.

185
00:12:36,571 --> 00:12:40,128
Dr. Tancredi found this

186
00:12:40,237 --> 00:12:43,260
embedded in your flesh
when she was treating you.

187
00:12:43,371 --> 00:12:46,166
Apparently, it came
from a guard's uniform.

188
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,861
Have you been assaulted by an officer?

189
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:53,503
Michael, Michael,

190
00:12:54,536 --> 00:12:56,002
I need an answer.

191
00:12:56,104 --> 00:12:58,797
This is not about
sticking to the inmates' code anymore.

192
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:01,630
This is about officer misconduct.
That's my responsibility.

193
00:13:01,737 --> 00:13:03,794
You wouldn't want to see me
lose my job now, would you?

194
00:13:03,903 --> 00:13:07,926
No, of course not. You have been
very good to me and my brother.

195
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:11,469
Then I need to know
where you got that burn. Right now.

196
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:16,094
Otherwise, your ass is going to solitary.
You understand?

197
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,260
It's your choice.

198
00:13:20,436 --> 00:13:23,164
Don't... Hey, please, listen to me.

199
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,993
- Cool down!
- Listen to me, don't do this!

200
00:13:26,104 --> 00:13:27,569
Don't do this!

201
00:13:30,503 --> 00:13:31,696
Michael!

202
00:13:32,803 --> 00:13:33,791
No!

203
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:49,960
Michael?

204
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,862
Michael?

205
00:13:54,737 --> 00:13:55,793
Michael?

206
00:14:01,169 --> 00:14:03,726
- Linc?
- What the hell are you doing in here?

207
00:14:05,802 --> 00:14:08,700
Linc, we're in a lot of trouble now.

208
00:14:10,036 --> 00:14:11,161
What happened?

209
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:13,428
The Pope asked some questions

210
00:14:14,169 --> 00:14:15,691
that I couldn't answer.

211
00:14:15,802 --> 00:14:17,132
About what?

212
00:14:18,569 --> 00:14:22,058
He's got proof that I was
where I wasn't supposed to be.

213
00:14:22,502 --> 00:14:26,434
He doesn't know it, but sooner or later
he's going to put the whole thing together.

214
00:14:26,535 --> 00:14:28,195
There's no way out of this.

215
00:14:28,303 --> 00:14:29,768
Yeah, there is.

216
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:32,334
- You just got to keep the faith.
- No.

217
00:14:33,136 --> 00:14:36,363
I put my blood into this,
and it's coming apart.

218
00:14:36,569 --> 00:14:37,694
Listen to me.

219
00:14:37,802 --> 00:14:40,324
The whole point of solitary is to break you,

220
00:14:40,569 --> 00:14:41,865
make you crazy.

221
00:14:41,969 --> 00:14:44,799
You got to keep strong, you hear me?

222
00:14:45,235 --> 00:14:46,929
Don't let them break you.

223
00:14:47,235 --> 00:14:49,201
I put my blood into this.

224
00:14:54,135 --> 00:14:58,000
Look, baby, I'm so sorry it took me so long
to get back to you.

225
00:14:58,802 --> 00:15:02,859
Turns out that our division is not
getting mobilized for a couple more days.

226
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:05,628
When I didn't hear from you,
I didn't know what to think, baby.

227
00:15:05,736 --> 00:15:09,498
I got so worried. I started
watching the news, looking for casualties.

228
00:15:09,935 --> 00:15:12,836
I'm so sorry about all this.
You gotta believe that.

229
00:15:14,302 --> 00:15:16,564
I started calling
the rear detachment office,

230
00:15:16,669 --> 00:15:19,760
asking if there was some sort of problem
with the 117th.

231
00:15:23,469 --> 00:15:24,435
No.

232
00:15:24,535 --> 00:15:26,524
<i>There's not a problem with the 117th.</i>

233
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:28,759
<i>We're coming back. It's a snafu, that's all.</i>

234
00:15:28,868 --> 00:15:31,800
<i>A couple more days,
and we'll be on those hops, baby.</i>

235
00:15:32,235 --> 00:15:34,894
That's not what
the rear detachment officer said.

236
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:38,525
<i>He said the 117th wasn't coming home
for another six months.</i>

237
00:15:38,634 --> 00:15:42,532
What? No. That can't be right.

238
00:15:42,634 --> 00:15:44,100
That's what he said.

239
00:15:44,601 --> 00:15:46,624
You know what it is?

240
00:15:46,935 --> 00:15:48,628
It's because we're transpo.

241
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:51,792
You know, technically
we're on a loan-out from the 140th.

242
00:15:51,901 --> 00:15:53,867
I mean, that's why he said that.

243
00:15:53,968 --> 00:15:56,627
- The 140th?
- Yeah, yeah.

244
00:15:57,968 --> 00:15:59,797
It's just a few more days.

245
00:15:59,901 --> 00:16:01,366
<i>That's all. I mean,</i>

246
00:16:01,468 --> 00:16:03,798
you don't need to go calling anyone.

247
00:16:03,901 --> 00:16:05,560
<i>I'll be back, okay?</i>

248
00:16:05,668 --> 00:16:09,293
I will call you
as soon as I know the exact date.

249
00:16:10,234 --> 00:16:11,200
Okay?

250
00:16:11,668 --> 00:16:14,156
<i>- I love you.
- I love you.</i>

251
00:16:27,521 --> 00:16:31,180
- Michael's in the SHU.
- Oh, God, the hits just keep coming!

252
00:16:31,622 --> 00:16:34,111
Last thing we wanna do now
is panic, fellas.

253
00:16:34,254 --> 00:16:36,277
Oh, it's panic time, old head.

254
00:16:36,688 --> 00:16:39,176
We got an unfinished hole
in that room over there

255
00:16:39,288 --> 00:16:40,948
that Scofield was supposed to fill tonight.

256
00:16:41,054 --> 00:16:45,146
Come tomorrow 8:00 a.m.,
they rip up that carpet, our game is over.

257
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,751
Unless someone else fills it.

258
00:16:50,622 --> 00:16:51,781
<i>That's right, papi.</i>

259
00:16:51,888 --> 00:16:54,615
You're the only one
with a toilet open to the outside world.

260
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,415
You're saying
I go out there by myself tonight?

261
00:16:56,521 --> 00:16:58,714
- That's exactly what we're saying.
- Are you kidding? That's impossible.

262
00:16:58,822 --> 00:17:01,014
Look, I don't wanna hear impossible
from you right now!

263
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:03,713
I got people waiting on me,
people that I'm gonna lose,

264
00:17:03,821 --> 00:17:05,651
<i>unless you man up
and get some cojones, comprende?</i>

265
00:17:05,754 --> 00:17:08,186
<i>That's easy for you to say, pendejo.
It ain't your ass on the line.</i>

266
00:17:08,288 --> 00:17:10,345
All of our asses are on the line.

267
00:17:10,622 --> 00:17:13,712
And you're the only cat
that can do something about it.

268
00:17:15,321 --> 00:17:17,514
Yeah, maybe I can get out of my cell.

269
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:19,178
And maybe
I can get into the guards' room.

270
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:23,686
But even if I do, and I fill that hole in,
I'll still be in that room.

271
00:17:24,355 --> 00:17:26,287
I'll be sealed in. There's no way out.

272
00:17:26,388 --> 00:17:29,581
- Scofield must've had a way.
- He did.

273
00:17:30,721 --> 00:17:31,982
The grate at the sally port.

274
00:17:32,088 --> 00:17:33,986
Oh, that's right. The one out there
in the middle of the open?

275
00:17:34,088 --> 00:17:35,644
<i>Yeah, so you better lace up, amigo,</i>

276
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:38,346
'cause you're gonna have to
make a run for it.

277
00:17:38,587 --> 00:17:40,450
That's 10 years on my bid if I get caught.

278
00:17:40,554 --> 00:17:43,384
Then you better figure out a way
not to get caught.

279
00:17:43,487 --> 00:17:44,680
Line it up!

280
00:17:47,021 --> 00:17:49,851
<i>Tonight, primo. It's gotta be tonight.</i>

281
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:30,378
Michael. You okay?

282
00:18:31,649 --> 00:18:32,910
What you doing?

283
00:18:33,582 --> 00:18:36,605
I'm trying to remember
what's beneath psych ward.

284
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:38,977
You're thinking about the wrong thing.

285
00:18:39,816 --> 00:18:42,407
You got to think about
how to get out of here.

286
00:19:16,648 --> 00:19:17,841
Michael.

287
00:19:20,881 --> 00:19:23,313
Man, come on. Talk to me.

288
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:50,280
Uh-uh.

289
00:19:50,448 --> 00:19:52,414
Absolutely not.

290
00:19:52,748 --> 00:19:56,771
If I'm gonna be the one doing that running,
you gotta do some lifting, too.

291
00:20:03,314 --> 00:20:05,644
I mean, you know
what you're asking of me?

292
00:20:05,748 --> 00:20:07,611
You gotta do it for the team.

293
00:20:19,381 --> 00:20:22,074
Hey, sister. Your bloomers are showing.

294
00:20:22,481 --> 00:20:25,743
They aren't showing, baby,
they're flying. Proudly.

295
00:20:28,681 --> 00:20:31,272
I take it you are a party girl.

296
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,308
- LJ? Come on, we're leaving.
- Okay.

297
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:06,669
We get Quinn's phone powered up and
it could be a gold mine of information.

298
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,935
- No. Doesn't fit.
- We just need to find the right adapter.

299
00:21:11,047 --> 00:21:13,774
What about Quinn?
Are we just gonna leave him here?

300
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,573
You mean the guy
who shot me in the back?

301
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,207
Yeah, we're just gonna leave him here.

302
00:21:29,814 --> 00:21:31,973
You tell anyone about this, and I...

303
00:21:36,447 --> 00:21:38,743
<i>Capitol Hill saw
its first deadlock of the term</i>

304
00:21:38,847 --> 00:21:40,210
<i>on the Senate floor this morning.</i>

305
00:21:40,313 --> 00:21:43,938
<i>The hotly contested energy bill
ended up in a 50-50 tie.</i>

306
00:21:44,046 --> 00:21:46,410
<i>That means it will now be up to
Vice President Reynolds</i>

307
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,206
<i>to cast the deciding vote.</i>

308
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:51,569
I know I sound like a broken record,
but you work too hard.

309
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,145
You need to get out,
hang out with your friends more.

310
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:55,542
What about men?

311
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:00,235
If this is your exposé on my social life,
it's about to be a real sad one.

312
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,637
I...

313
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:04,504
I've had some bad luck
when it comes to relationships.

314
00:22:04,612 --> 00:22:07,044
You had bad luck or you had bad boys?

315
00:22:08,113 --> 00:22:10,704
I think I've managed to have
a little of both.

316
00:22:11,746 --> 00:22:14,837
Yeah, you know, you're right.
I don't tend to go for the nice guys.

317
00:22:14,946 --> 00:22:17,468
I like the ones
with the deep-seated emotional issues

318
00:22:17,579 --> 00:22:19,273
I can internalize and make my own.

319
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,470
Mmm-hmm. Like Scofield?

320
00:22:22,646 --> 00:22:25,044
- Nope, not like Scofield.
- Don't lie to me.

321
00:22:25,146 --> 00:22:27,271
Every time he comes in for his shot,

322
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:30,470
you spend 20 minutes
rolling up his sleeve.

323
00:22:30,579 --> 00:22:32,943
You know what? I think he's interesting.

324
00:22:33,779 --> 00:22:36,472
And I think he's attractive,
but he's still an inmate.

325
00:22:36,579 --> 00:22:38,909
I can promise you one thing.
And that's that you will never see

326
00:22:39,013 --> 00:22:41,376
anything happen
between me and an inmate.

327
00:23:38,379 --> 00:23:39,345
Michael.

328
00:23:40,845 --> 00:23:42,868
I put my blood into this.

329
00:23:43,611 --> 00:23:46,100
What? What'd you say?

330
00:23:50,344 --> 00:23:52,072
I put my blood into this.

331
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:35,199
- Stop! Freeze right there!
- Get down on your knees!

332
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:38,299
- Please don't shoot! Don't shoot!
- Freeze right there!

333
00:26:50,876 --> 00:26:52,137
You know the state of Illinois

334
00:26:52,242 --> 00:26:55,367
doesn't look too kindly upon prisoners
who try to escape.

335
00:27:02,676 --> 00:27:04,107
Charges are filed,

336
00:27:04,209 --> 00:27:06,675
you get sent back to county
for three months.

337
00:27:06,776 --> 00:27:09,241
Come back here with 10 more years
added to your bid.

338
00:27:09,342 --> 00:27:12,308
- I wasn't trying to escape.
- Sure you weren't.

339
00:27:13,176 --> 00:27:16,074
You were just out there
howling at the moon.

340
00:27:20,209 --> 00:27:24,039
<i>If I were you,
I'd better start talking, mano.</i>

341
00:27:27,042 --> 00:27:29,099
I stayed out after yard today.

342
00:27:29,209 --> 00:27:32,073
I waited under the bleachers
until it got dark.

343
00:27:32,176 --> 00:27:33,971
Something was gonna come
over the walls.

344
00:27:34,076 --> 00:27:36,133
Drugs is almost as bad as escape.

345
00:27:36,242 --> 00:27:38,935
Last guy had heroin slingshot
over the wall

346
00:27:39,042 --> 00:27:40,769
got a nickel added to his bid.

347
00:27:40,875 --> 00:27:43,501
- It wasn't drugs.
- Then what the hell was it?

348
00:27:44,809 --> 00:27:45,866
Frisk him!

349
00:27:54,176 --> 00:27:55,937
What do we have here?

350
00:28:04,775 --> 00:28:06,400
A pair of grunds?

351
00:28:07,375 --> 00:28:10,273
You risked going to the SHU
for a pair of grunds?

352
00:28:10,375 --> 00:28:14,432
Hell, you risked adding extra time
to your bid, all for a pair of panties?

353
00:28:14,542 --> 00:28:17,975
My girl just wanted me to know
she was thinking about me, boss.

354
00:28:20,175 --> 00:28:22,835
You got a real beefer on your hands,
don't you?

355
00:28:23,075 --> 00:28:26,008
I know, boss.
It's the dumbest thing I've ever done.

356
00:28:26,108 --> 00:28:29,597
I'm just scared that being here,
I'm gonna lose her.

357
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:33,765
- He did it for love.
- Then you understand.

358
00:28:35,108 --> 00:28:38,972
Yeah, sure, Sucre. I understand.

359
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:49,564
Don't let me catch you alone
next time, okay?

360
00:28:52,741 --> 00:28:55,299
- Sucre!
- Sink?

361
00:28:56,808 --> 00:28:57,933
Sucre.

362
00:29:01,141 --> 00:29:03,300
- Where's Michael?
- Other side of you.

363
00:29:07,041 --> 00:29:09,098
Michael! Michael!

364
00:29:10,308 --> 00:29:11,500
Michael!

365
00:29:12,108 --> 00:29:13,301
Michael!

366
00:29:14,175 --> 00:29:15,402
Michael!

367
00:29:16,208 --> 00:29:17,798
Michael, come on.

368
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:21,499
Badge!

369
00:29:24,275 --> 00:29:25,399
Badge!

370
00:29:27,041 --> 00:29:28,098
Yeah?

371
00:29:28,607 --> 00:29:30,334
Check out my brother.
He's not responding.

372
00:29:30,441 --> 00:29:32,532
- What?
- Scofield. Check him out.

373
00:29:32,641 --> 00:29:34,732
He's not responding. Please.

374
00:29:40,307 --> 00:29:41,534
Scofield.

375
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:45,968
Scofield.

376
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,001
- I need a medic in 12 now. I repeat, now.
- What?

377
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:00,163
There's an electronics store
on Eighth Avenue. Grab his phone.

378
00:30:00,274 --> 00:30:03,001
We'll be back in 10 minutes.
Stay on the couch.

379
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:47,833
<i>Hi, you've reached Owen Kravecki.</i>

380
00:30:47,943 --> 00:30:49,932
<i>I can't come to the phone right now.</i>

381
00:30:50,377 --> 00:30:53,809
You really think you're gonna get
to four buttons before I get to one?

382
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:58,104
<i>Leave a message, and I'll return your call.
Thanks. Have a great day.</i>

383
00:31:03,443 --> 00:31:04,807
Light on 12.

384
00:31:17,843 --> 00:31:19,809
Would you wait outside, please?

385
00:31:22,543 --> 00:31:23,736
Michael?

386
00:31:29,076 --> 00:31:32,338
Okay, you're going to feel my fingers
on your wrist.

387
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:42,599
Come on, I need your eyes.

388
00:31:52,376 --> 00:31:54,967
I'm going to take a look at that hand.

389
00:32:04,576 --> 00:32:06,303
You're going to be okay.

390
00:32:07,076 --> 00:32:08,735
You're going to be okay.

391
00:32:23,209 --> 00:32:25,038
- Sucre got...
- I heard.

392
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,299
<i>Papi better had did us right, man.</i>

393
00:32:27,409 --> 00:32:29,341
Hope he had enough time.

394
00:32:29,876 --> 00:32:32,172
Looks like we're about to find out.

395
00:32:44,709 --> 00:32:45,834
<i>Make it fast.</i>

396
00:32:45,942 --> 00:32:47,840
I thought we picked
Lincoln Burrows off the street

397
00:32:47,942 --> 00:32:49,965
because he was some lowlife
who couldn't defend himself.

398
00:32:50,076 --> 00:32:52,268
Now I learn it's all about his father,
some old spook

399
00:32:52,375 --> 00:32:54,432
<i>that the Company's
trying to settle a score with?</i>

400
00:32:54,542 --> 00:32:56,167
Well, fortunately for us,

401
00:32:56,275 --> 00:33:00,139
the Company's agenda and our agenda
have the same endgame.

402
00:33:00,242 --> 00:33:01,868
<i>Caroline, I've been doing this for 15 years,</i>

403
00:33:01,975 --> 00:33:04,737
and it's never been about anything
other than you, your family,

404
00:33:04,842 --> 00:33:07,034
and most importantly, this country.

405
00:33:07,142 --> 00:33:09,233
<i>Now, I need to know
who I'm working for here.</i>

406
00:33:09,342 --> 00:33:11,274
You are working for me.

407
00:33:13,275 --> 00:33:14,764
Promise me that.

408
00:33:14,875 --> 00:33:17,966
I promise you, Paul. I got to go now.

409
00:33:22,841 --> 00:33:25,330
And to what do I owe this honor?

410
00:33:25,875 --> 00:33:28,636
To the vote on the Senate floor
this afternoon.

411
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:31,005
Look, I get it.

412
00:33:31,108 --> 00:33:34,972
The vote comes down to me, I vote "no."
Lt'll get done.

413
00:33:35,142 --> 00:33:39,234
Well, actually, we are going to need you
to vote "yes" on this one.

414
00:33:42,108 --> 00:33:44,233
I want to make sure I heard you straight.

415
00:33:44,342 --> 00:33:47,569
You want me to vote
on the environmentalists' side?

416
00:33:47,741 --> 00:33:49,468
This isn't about a vote.

417
00:33:49,574 --> 00:33:52,665
This is about you
and how you look to voters.

418
00:33:52,775 --> 00:33:56,639
Now, we have a nation that is growing
increasingly hungry for alternate energy.

419
00:33:56,741 --> 00:33:58,798
So if you come across as more centrist,

420
00:33:58,908 --> 00:34:00,874
you'll appeal to the broader swath
of the electorate,

421
00:34:00,975 --> 00:34:03,907
the very people
who will get you elected next year.

422
00:34:07,641 --> 00:34:10,368
Besides, once that bill
hits the President's desk, he'll veto it.

423
00:34:10,474 --> 00:34:14,236
Then we'll get precisely what
we always wanted anyway, won't we?

424
00:34:22,107 --> 00:34:25,699
You probably don't have
a hair on your body, do you?

425
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:28,970
Just back your punk ass up.

426
00:34:30,141 --> 00:34:32,902
Hey, Tweener! Get over here.

427
00:34:44,007 --> 00:34:46,599
Looks like Avocado
has taken a shine to you.

428
00:34:46,707 --> 00:34:50,639
- I could set you up as cellies if you want.
- Stop it, all right?

429
00:34:52,574 --> 00:34:54,437
I got something for you this time.

430
00:34:54,541 --> 00:34:57,098
Scofield and his boys,
they're up to something.

431
00:34:57,207 --> 00:34:59,866
How about being a little more specific?

432
00:35:00,241 --> 00:35:04,105
Whatever it is, it's got to do
with that room they're fixing.

433
00:35:04,207 --> 00:35:06,196
Something to do with the carpet.

434
00:35:29,206 --> 00:35:30,866
Excuse me, fellas.

435
00:35:32,607 --> 00:35:34,096
Out of the way!

436
00:36:24,407 --> 00:36:25,599
Michael!

437
00:36:27,706 --> 00:36:29,797
Michael! Michael!

438
00:37:51,105 --> 00:37:53,502
He's totally non-responsive,
so start him on chlorpromazine.

439
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:55,434
And I believe he's in danger
of a psychotic break.

440
00:37:55,538 --> 00:37:57,629
I want you to notify me immediately
if and when that happens.

441
00:37:57,738 --> 00:37:58,761
- All right.
- Thank you.

442
00:37:58,872 --> 00:37:59,838
Come on.

443
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:03,227
Come this way.
Come on. Here you go.

444
00:38:04,972 --> 00:38:06,335
Watch your step.

445
00:38:14,105 --> 00:38:15,536
Clean him up.

446
00:39:13,837 --> 00:39:15,303
You scared me.

447
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:18,668
Put it down. You're not a killer.

448
00:39:18,771 --> 00:39:21,203
You don't want to make
any rash mistakes here, LJ.

449
00:39:24,504 --> 00:39:26,697
- Don't move!
- Go easy, go easy...

450
00:39:26,804 --> 00:39:27,997
Shut up!

451
00:39:28,537 --> 00:39:31,060
LJ, there's other ways out of this,
you know, okay?

452
00:39:31,171 --> 00:39:32,431
I can help you beat this rap,

453
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:35,264
but if you pull that trigger,
you really will be a killer,

454
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:36,893
and then I can't help you, okay?

455
00:39:37,004 --> 00:39:39,299
I'm government, LJ.
There's a lot of things I can do for you.

456
00:39:39,404 --> 00:39:41,870
The only thing you can do for me is die!

457
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:43,500
Drop your weapon!

458
00:39:45,004 --> 00:39:46,697
I said drop your weapon!

459
00:39:48,038 --> 00:39:51,128
Guess you're going to have to take
a rain check on that one, huh?

460
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:55,832
Drop the gun now!

461
00:40:10,836 --> 00:40:12,768
No. I did what you said.

462
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:15,502
- You brought me a pile of crap.
- There was nothing there.

463
00:40:15,604 --> 00:40:17,627
Boss, come on, man.
I just need some more time.

464
00:40:17,736 --> 00:40:20,702
You had your time.
You're a waste of my fries.

465
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:25,234
Open on 88!

466
00:40:25,337 --> 00:40:26,996
Boss, come on, man!

467
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:31,232
Dude, just give me another try.

468
00:40:35,803 --> 00:40:37,201
Close on 88!

469
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:43,000
Have at it.

470
00:40:44,803 --> 00:40:45,860
Boss.

471
00:40:49,037 --> 00:40:50,094
Boss!

472
00:40:54,403 --> 00:40:57,836
- You're lucky.
- Kid's got a warrant for double homicide.

473
00:40:58,469 --> 00:41:01,163
- Oh, dear. Are you serious?
- Did you have any prior contact with him?

474
00:41:01,269 --> 00:41:03,326
- Any idea why he chose your house?
- No, none.

475
00:41:03,436 --> 00:41:05,698
I mean, he was screaming something like,
"You killed my mom,"

476
00:41:05,803 --> 00:41:09,860
and going on
about me being a government agent, and...

477
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:13,002
I don't know, it just seemed like that kid
was on drugs or something.

478
00:41:13,102 --> 00:41:15,034
What do you do for a living, Mr. Kravecki?

479
00:41:15,136 --> 00:41:19,159
I'm a regional sales manager
for a dehydrated meat distributor.

480
00:41:19,303 --> 00:41:21,599
- What, you mean like jerky?
- Yes.

481
00:41:21,703 --> 00:41:23,760
- You a fan?
- What kind?

482
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:25,062
Buffalo.

483
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:31,699
Have some. Really.
I'm swimming in the stuff.

484
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:45,896
One hour till lunch.

485
00:41:55,635 --> 00:41:56,931
So, what's the problem?

486
00:41:57,036 --> 00:41:58,468
You're looking at it.

487
00:41:58,568 --> 00:42:01,399
- What, Haywire?
- Yep. He's my new cellmate.

488
00:42:01,735 --> 00:42:05,327
They think I have schizoaffective disorder
with bipolar tendencies.

489
00:42:14,869 --> 00:42:15,857
Your tattoos.

490
00:42:15,969 --> 00:42:17,026
What about them?

491
00:42:17,136 --> 00:42:18,863
- What are they of?
- They're just tattoos.

492
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:20,798
The man's got a maze on his skin.

493
00:42:20,902 --> 00:42:21,890
Why would he do that?

494
00:42:22,002 --> 00:42:24,161
Why would he put a maze on his skin?

495
00:42:24,568 --> 00:42:26,034
It's a pathway.

496
00:42:26,136 --> 00:42:27,567
Where does it lead?

497
00:42:30,235 --> 00:42:31,496
Hello, roomie.

498
00:42:33,201 --> 00:42:35,497
You were right about my tattoo.

499
00:42:35,702 --> 00:42:38,190
It is a path, just like you thought.

500
00:42:38,735 --> 00:42:42,599
And I need you to remember
when you saw it, Haywire.

501
00:42:43,035 --> 00:42:45,160
I need you to remember
what it looked like.

502
00:42:45,268 --> 00:42:47,427
Do you think you can do that for me?

503
00:42:50,368 --> 00:42:51,732
Who are you?
