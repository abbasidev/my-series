00:00:01,135 --> 00:00:03,296
<i>Previously on Prison Break:</i>

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,164
I'm through.

3
00:00:07,274 --> 00:00:08,571
See you on the other side.

4
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,344
It can't be done.

5
00:00:14,582 --> 00:00:16,209
We're not getting out of here.

6
00:00:16,317 --> 00:00:19,445
There's only one person
who can really stop this execution.

7
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:21,418
Would you talk to your father for me?

8
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:24,753
I'm the last person in the world
that my father listens to.

9
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:28,124
The Governor has reviewed your case.

10
00:00:28,229 --> 00:00:30,026
He's not granting clemency.

11
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,597
Let's proceed.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,331
I came in here a man.

13
00:00:34,435 --> 00:00:36,869
Give me the strength
to walk out of here a man.

14
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,122
Doctor, you can leave now.

15
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:20,535
It's him.

16
00:02:23,077 --> 00:02:24,101
Michael.

17
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:26,779
What's he saying?

18
00:02:27,348 --> 00:02:29,578
Michael, turn around.

19
00:02:31,085 --> 00:02:32,143
It's him.

20
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:34,117
What do you think he's saying?

21
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:36,485
Michael, turn around.

22
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:06,346
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

23
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:09,254
What's happening?

24
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:14,052
What the hell's going on in there?

25
00:03:48,796 --> 00:03:52,254
I can't tell you how sorry I am
that you've had to go through all of this.

26
00:03:58,605 --> 00:03:59,765
Lincoln.

27
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:09,573
What happened in there?

28
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:12,982
Judge Kessler called.
The execution's been delayed.

29
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,314
What do you mean delayed?

30
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,286
Apparently, some new evidence
has come to light.

31
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,483
- What evidence?
- I don't understand.

32
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,890
How long do we have? One day, two days?

33
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:24,054
That's all the information
I have at the moment. I'm sorry.

34
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:27,391
I'll give you a minute.

35
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,197
You okay?

36
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:33,904
I need to know how much time we have.

37
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:36,738
I'll go and see the judge and find out.

38
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,944
You're with Michael. You'll be okay.

39
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:46,379
- Did you see him?
- Who?

40
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:49,047
- The guy in the viewing room.
- No.

41
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:52,523
It was Dad.

44
00:05:33,078 --> 00:05:34,841
It was him. I know it was.

45
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,938
That's not possible, Linc.

46
00:05:37,048 --> 00:05:39,039
It is possible. I saw him.

47
00:05:39,151 --> 00:05:41,346
I don't know how you could have.

48
00:05:41,453 --> 00:05:43,648
There were only half a dozen people
in that room.

49
00:05:43,755 --> 00:05:46,918
Me, Veronica and a bunch of reporters.

50
00:05:47,726 --> 00:05:49,956
- He wasn't there.
- You don't know that.

51
00:05:50,061 --> 00:05:52,029
I do. I would have recognized him.

52
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:54,826
You don't remember what he looks like.
I do.

53
00:05:54,933 --> 00:05:58,164
This is a man who took off,
what, 30 years ago?

54
00:05:59,604 --> 00:06:03,062
Why would he come back now,
at the very last minute?

55
00:06:05,143 --> 00:06:06,440
I don't know.

56
00:06:07,679 --> 00:06:09,613
Why is he still alive?

57
00:06:10,081 --> 00:06:14,211
It appears that some information
was anonymously slipped to the judge.

58
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,684
Anonymously?

59
00:06:15,887 --> 00:06:18,617
It was your fat little friend, Hale.

60
00:06:18,723 --> 00:06:21,351
- Lf you had taken care of him sooner...
- It wasn't Hale.

61
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,087
How do you know that?

62
00:06:23,195 --> 00:06:25,026
If Hale had given Veronica Donovan

63
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,995
anything that could have
gotten a stay of execution,

64
00:06:27,098 --> 00:06:30,465
I think she would have brought it up
when she made her argument in court.

65
00:06:30,569 --> 00:06:31,797
It didn't come from him.

66
00:06:31,903 --> 00:06:33,370
Well, who else on your end knows?

67
00:06:33,472 --> 00:06:36,100
Who else on your end knows?
Why all the finger-pointing at us?

68
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,870
Are you sure that the leak didn't come
from your end? From the company?

69
00:06:38,977 --> 00:06:42,276
Hey, we are all
on the same team, remember?

70
00:06:43,148 --> 00:06:44,445
Absolutely.

71
00:06:47,352 --> 00:06:50,048
Just find the leak and plug it.

72
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:54,690
Thank you, ma'am.

73
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,020
One more thing.

74
00:07:02,267 --> 00:07:04,167
The next time you're in my office,

75
00:07:04,269 --> 00:07:07,170
I expect you to stand
when you're addressing me.

76
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,034
Absolutely.

77
00:07:15,947 --> 00:07:18,677
All I can tell is
I was working late in chambers,

78
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,216
I left at 11:00,

79
00:07:20,619 --> 00:07:22,985
and there it was, right under my door.

80
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:26,323
One is Terrence Steadman's
autopsy report.

81
00:07:26,424 --> 00:07:30,155
In it, his appendix is noted
as present and unremarkable.

82
00:07:30,529 --> 00:07:32,793
The other paper is an operative report

83
00:07:32,898 --> 00:07:35,230
from when Mr. Steadman
was 12 years old.

84
00:07:35,734 --> 00:07:37,861
The procedure was an appendectomy.

85
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,697
That's impossible. Let me see this.

86
00:07:40,805 --> 00:07:42,170
I want the conviction overturned

87
00:07:42,274 --> 00:07:44,367
and Lincoln Burrows
immediately released from custody.

88
00:07:44,476 --> 00:07:48,242
Whoa, whoa, whoa, not so fast.
These records haven't even been certified.

89
00:07:48,346 --> 00:07:49,608
The hospital can tell you.

90
00:07:49,714 --> 00:07:53,206
The hospital does not keep records
going back that far. I checked.

91
00:07:53,318 --> 00:07:54,410
So as far as we know,

92
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:57,920
these documents could be a hoax
from some anti-death penalty advocate

93
00:07:58,023 --> 00:08:00,048
or, dare I say it, defense counsel.

94
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:01,785
Oh, please. You're preposterous.

95
00:08:01,893 --> 00:08:04,157
Let's just all
take a deep breath here, okay?

96
00:08:04,262 --> 00:08:05,786
I don't know what these papers mean

97
00:08:05,897 --> 00:08:08,422
and for that reason,
I'd like to err on the side of caution.

98
00:08:08,533 --> 00:08:11,559
I'm going to delay the execution
for two weeks.

99
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:15,265
That should give us more than enough
time to exhume the body.

100
00:08:15,707 --> 00:08:16,969
Exhume the body.

101
00:08:17,075 --> 00:08:21,034
Your Honor, all due respect,
that is a drastic measure.

102
00:08:21,146 --> 00:08:23,171
It's also the only way we're going to know

103
00:08:23,281 --> 00:08:26,011
if that body in the ground
is really Terrence Steadman.

104
00:08:30,422 --> 00:08:31,220
<i>Recreation hour will be over in 10...</i>

105
00:08:31,221 --> 00:08:32,587
<i>Recreation hour will be over in 10...</i>

106
00:08:32,691 --> 00:08:34,955
So that's not
Steadman that was buried?

107
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,425
<i>We don't know.</i>

108
00:08:36,761 --> 00:08:38,661
<i>If it isn't, Lincoln's free.</i>

109
00:08:39,598 --> 00:08:41,862
<i>If it is, we're right back where we started.</i>

110
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:43,832
<i>Take care of yourself, Michael.</i>

111
00:08:46,972 --> 00:08:50,100
So, that body, what if it's him?

112
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:52,369
Well, I'm not going to sit around hoping.

113
00:08:53,745 --> 00:08:55,212
What does that mean?

114
00:08:56,281 --> 00:08:58,181
It means we get back to work.

115
00:08:58,283 --> 00:09:00,513
God, I was hoping you would say that.

116
00:09:01,186 --> 00:09:03,245
They're digging up the body, huh?

117
00:09:03,989 --> 00:09:07,550
To be honest, I've never been
in a situation like this before.

118
00:09:09,327 --> 00:09:11,192
If nothing else, you can be glad

119
00:09:11,296 --> 00:09:15,062
that you've got people who'll go
to extreme lengths to get you out of here.

120
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,797
No kidding.

121
00:09:20,005 --> 00:09:21,097
Warden,

122
00:09:24,175 --> 00:09:28,111
at the execution,
there was a man in the viewing room.

123
00:09:28,647 --> 00:09:32,413
Just wondering if you or anyone
in the prison had spoken to him.

124
00:09:33,451 --> 00:09:36,443
Well, according to this,

125
00:09:37,789 --> 00:09:41,486
those present were your brother,
his attorney and three reporters,

126
00:09:41,926 --> 00:09:43,518
two women and a man.

127
00:09:43,628 --> 00:09:45,562
The man, who was he?

128
00:09:47,032 --> 00:09:49,262
<i>He was from The Headline Press.</i>

129
00:09:49,734 --> 00:09:51,031
William Prall.

130
00:09:52,137 --> 00:09:53,468
You know him?

131
00:09:55,073 --> 00:09:56,040
No.

132
00:10:03,314 --> 00:10:04,474
Guard.

133
00:10:14,259 --> 00:10:16,022
Hold it steady, please.

134
00:10:16,227 --> 00:10:18,559
What exactly are you looking for
in all that ink?

135
00:10:18,663 --> 00:10:20,221
A new way out of here.

136
00:10:21,099 --> 00:10:23,727
- You don't know those plans by now?
- No.

137
00:10:24,903 --> 00:10:27,736
Memorizing it would be like
memorizing the phone book.

138
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,501
Yeah, but why not just tat up Route 66?

139
00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:32,299
Contingencies.

140
00:10:33,712 --> 00:10:35,202
Contingencies?

141
00:10:37,282 --> 00:10:40,308
- You saying you found another way?
- Maybe.

142
00:10:40,418 --> 00:10:42,181
What do you mean, maybe?

143
00:10:42,287 --> 00:10:45,552
There's always been another way,
but it's suicide.

144
00:10:56,901 --> 00:10:59,927
Man, I'm so cold my hands are stinging.

145
00:11:00,038 --> 00:11:02,905
You know what they say
about weather in the Midwest,

146
00:11:03,007 --> 00:11:05,532
if you don't like it, wait an hour.

147
00:11:08,246 --> 00:11:10,009
We're still going out through the infirmary

148
00:11:10,115 --> 00:11:12,083
and we're still going to do it
from the guards' room.

149
00:11:12,183 --> 00:11:14,708
It's just the in-between
that's gonna have to change.

150
00:11:14,819 --> 00:11:16,787
Now wait a minute.
Why are you changing the plan, man?

151
00:11:16,888 --> 00:11:18,788
We're already through that room
beneath the infirmary.

152
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:21,358
That's all we gotta do is get through
that pipe and we're home free.

153
00:11:21,459 --> 00:11:24,257
There's a reason they replaced it
with a 12-inch pipe, Darwin.

154
00:11:24,362 --> 00:11:25,886
People can't get through it.

155
00:11:25,997 --> 00:11:28,727
The only way we're getting
into that infirmary is from beneath.

156
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:31,028
We're going to have to find another way.

157
00:11:32,971 --> 00:11:34,097
The psych ward?

158
00:11:34,205 --> 00:11:37,072
It's the only building that shares
a subsurface line with the infirmary.

159
00:11:37,175 --> 00:11:38,904
You telling me,

160
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:42,377
to get to the infirmary
we gotta go through the whack shack?

161
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,970
Unless you got a better idea.

162
00:11:44,082 --> 00:11:45,674
And there's a subsurface line

163
00:11:45,784 --> 00:11:48,548
that runs from the guards' room
to the psych ward?

164
00:11:48,653 --> 00:11:49,881
Sort of.

165
00:11:49,988 --> 00:11:52,183
Oh, whoa, whoa.
What do you mean "sort of"?

166
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,315
We can go into that hole
in the guards' room.

167
00:11:54,425 --> 00:11:58,361
About 40 yards up Route 66, there's
a grate and that'll get us halfway there.

168
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:02,027
- And what about the rest of the way?
- We gotta do it above ground.

169
00:12:02,133 --> 00:12:04,328
Oh, so it's just a bunch of cons

170
00:12:04,435 --> 00:12:07,233
taking a stroll in the middle of the night
for all the guards to see?

171
00:12:07,338 --> 00:12:08,362
Yep.

172
00:12:09,908 --> 00:12:12,103
You're right. It is suicide.

173
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:22,750
This grate that you're talking about,
it's hidden, right, partner?

174
00:12:22,854 --> 00:12:26,221
- The COs can't see it.
- Not exactly.

175
00:12:26,324 --> 00:12:29,293
- Well, where is it?
- You're standing on it.

176
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:33,158
Oh, hell no.

177
00:12:33,832 --> 00:12:36,926
When we come up out of
that ground there, that tower there,

178
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,337
that tower there,

179
00:12:41,873 --> 00:12:44,273
that tower behind me is gonna see us.

180
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:46,900
We'll be like ducks in a shooting range.
You feel me?

181
00:12:47,011 --> 00:12:48,376
Hurry it up, cons.

182
00:12:48,947 --> 00:12:50,972
Your plan sucks, snowflake.

183
00:13:14,439 --> 00:13:16,532
I gotta go back into the walls tonight.

184
00:13:16,641 --> 00:13:17,699
Why?

185
00:13:17,809 --> 00:13:21,677
I gotta get over to psych ward,
familiarize myself with the pipes beneath,

186
00:13:22,513 --> 00:13:24,708
make sure we can get through.

187
00:13:24,816 --> 00:13:28,183
I don't know, Michael.
C-Note's got a point.

188
00:13:28,653 --> 00:13:32,612
We come up in the middle of that yard,
we're sitting ducks.

189
00:13:33,725 --> 00:13:34,953
I know.

190
00:13:46,104 --> 00:13:47,731
I might have an idea.

191
00:13:51,042 --> 00:13:54,569
My family and I are more than dismayed

192
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:59,480
by Judge Kessler's decision
to allow the exhumation of my brother.

193
00:14:00,685 --> 00:14:04,951
<i>This stunt
by Lincoln Burrows' defense counsel</i>

194
00:14:05,056 --> 00:14:09,049
<i>is an affront and an insult
to the memory of my brother,</i>

195
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,823
<i>a good man who tried
to make positive change in this country.</i>

196
00:14:13,798 --> 00:14:16,232
This is being done in the name

197
00:14:16,334 --> 00:14:20,703
of trying to release
a convicted killer from prison.

198
00:14:24,108 --> 00:14:26,042
Steadman asked for a green burial.

199
00:14:26,144 --> 00:14:28,738
No embalming, biodegradable coffin.

200
00:14:28,846 --> 00:14:31,406
It's very environmentally aware.

201
00:14:31,516 --> 00:14:34,679
Or smart, if you don't want the body
to be identified.

202
00:14:39,223 --> 00:14:42,021
We haven't hung in months
and now you want a favor?

203
00:14:42,126 --> 00:14:45,095
You know I love you, cuz,
but that's a big ask.

204
00:14:45,196 --> 00:14:48,290
- I gotta say no.
- You can't say no.

205
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:49,826
Whatever.

206
00:14:49,934 --> 00:14:52,198
If my mom, or worse, your mom knows

207
00:14:52,303 --> 00:14:55,101
I did anything in here
to get you in trouble, forget it.

208
00:14:55,206 --> 00:14:56,571
<i>I'm in prison, pendejo.</i>

209
00:14:56,674 --> 00:14:59,336
- How much trouble can I get into?
- A lot.

210
00:15:00,378 --> 00:15:02,039
You owe me.

211
00:15:02,146 --> 00:15:04,910
Like hell I do. It's your turn, not mine.

212
00:15:05,249 --> 00:15:07,274
Miss Mangini's broken window.

213
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:09,748
The Terrado sisters?

214
00:15:09,954 --> 00:15:12,047
Your brother's "lost" El Camino.

215
00:15:13,024 --> 00:15:15,151
The church collection basket.

216
00:15:15,259 --> 00:15:16,556
The donkey.

217
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,223
Yo.

218
00:15:23,167 --> 00:15:24,964
We took an oath, bro.

219
00:15:25,503 --> 00:15:27,061
Don't make me break it.

220
00:15:29,907 --> 00:15:32,307
<i>Come on, Linc,
we want to catch batting practice.</i>

221
00:15:34,278 --> 00:15:36,212
Let's hurry. Take my hand.

222
00:15:44,722 --> 00:15:46,713
- Great seats, huh?
- Yeah.

223
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,922
See Number 11 over there?

224
00:15:49,027 --> 00:15:51,393
Keep your eye on him. Watch him closely.

225
00:16:03,975 --> 00:16:05,203
You got it?

226
00:16:06,411 --> 00:16:07,537
Where is it?

227
00:16:08,012 --> 00:16:09,479
Oh, he's cool.

228
00:16:11,983 --> 00:16:14,247
You get caught with this, they'll kill you.

229
00:16:14,352 --> 00:16:16,718
Hey, and I need this back by morning.

230
00:16:16,821 --> 00:16:19,483
They'll know if something like that
is missing.

231
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:23,022
And, cuz, now you owe me.

232
00:16:54,992 --> 00:16:57,051
Hey, you dropped something.

233
00:16:57,428 --> 00:17:01,057
- Does that say "Iraq"?
- Thanks.

234
00:17:16,814 --> 00:17:18,406
Let's look busy.

235
00:17:20,017 --> 00:17:21,507
What the hell?

236
00:17:22,753 --> 00:17:24,220
Oh, shoot.

237
00:17:25,356 --> 00:17:27,221
Damn, bro, what did you do?

238
00:17:28,426 --> 00:17:30,417
It's the cement we dug up.

239
00:17:37,101 --> 00:17:41,128
My God, you cons are slower
than a spelling bee full of stutterers.

240
00:17:41,439 --> 00:17:45,967
You all think you can slow-walk this job?
Play grab-ass in here?

241
00:17:46,077 --> 00:17:47,669
Drag it out for months?

242
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:49,669
Get to work.

243
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,111
You got it, boss.

244
00:17:53,584 --> 00:17:55,279
How about it, eight ball?

245
00:17:57,355 --> 00:17:58,686
Get to work.

246
00:18:00,224 --> 00:18:04,456
Oh, you know, boss, my leg fell asleep.

247
00:18:04,562 --> 00:18:06,359
You disobeying me, convict?

248
00:18:06,664 --> 00:18:08,359
The man said get to work.

249
00:18:09,167 --> 00:18:11,362
What the hell is your problem, old head?

250
00:18:11,469 --> 00:18:15,565
My problem is young con punks who
don't know how things work around here.

251
00:18:15,873 --> 00:18:17,704
Construction's a sweet gig.

252
00:18:17,808 --> 00:18:21,767
You wanna clean toilets, be my guest.
Otherwise, grab a hammer.

253
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,477
All right.

254
00:18:24,248 --> 00:18:28,082
Still got some piss and vinegar
in those old veins, huh, Charles?

255
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,651
I like it.

256
00:18:39,397 --> 00:18:40,591
Close one, huh?

257
00:18:51,108 --> 00:18:52,473
Oh, man.

258
00:18:53,744 --> 00:18:55,405
What are we gonna do with this?

259
00:18:57,582 --> 00:18:59,345
It was Ole Miss, right? Ole Miss?

260
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:02,476
- Nah, it was a Midwestern school.
- Iowa.

261
00:19:02,587 --> 00:19:04,714
No, not lowa. Hold on a sec.

262
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,052
Hey, Bagwell.

263
00:19:15,366 --> 00:19:18,733
Hey, do you know what school
Art Schlichter played for?

264
00:19:21,572 --> 00:19:23,472
Not really sure there, boss.

265
00:19:29,847 --> 00:19:32,839
I really ain't much of a football guy, boss.
Too much violence.

266
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,781
Come on, you know the guy
I'm talking about.

267
00:19:34,885 --> 00:19:37,149
Art Schlichter, the quarterback,
got nailed for gambling.

268
00:19:37,255 --> 00:19:39,553
No, doesn't really ring a bell.

269
00:19:39,657 --> 00:19:42,683
Bet if I asked you what his ass looked like,
you'd remember.

270
00:19:42,793 --> 00:19:45,125
Hey, maybe someone
in the brain trust knows.

271
00:19:45,529 --> 00:19:48,862
Stolte, come on, man,
let's grab some lunch.

272
00:19:48,966 --> 00:19:52,231
Hold on, I just want to figure this out.
It's driving me crazy.

273
00:19:52,336 --> 00:19:53,803
Ohio State!

274
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:02,309
That's right. He was a Buckeye.

275
00:20:04,448 --> 00:20:06,939
You're not completely worthless, after all.

276
00:20:13,691 --> 00:20:15,283
How's your stomach?

277
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,352
Any more vomiting?

278
00:20:18,062 --> 00:20:20,656
Just nauseous. Must be the nerves.

279
00:20:20,765 --> 00:20:22,733
That's understandable, considering.

280
00:20:23,034 --> 00:20:26,128
- I can give you something for it.
- No, that's fine.

281
00:20:27,405 --> 00:20:28,702
All right.

282
00:20:29,707 --> 00:20:32,608
You let me know
if there's anything you need.

283
00:20:34,512 --> 00:20:37,811
- Can I ask you a question, Doc?
- Yeah. What?

284
00:20:38,149 --> 00:20:41,175
With all that went down yesterday,
head pounding, heart racing,

285
00:20:41,285 --> 00:20:43,845
could that cause me
to see something that wasn't there?

286
00:20:43,954 --> 00:20:46,514
Yeah. Yeah, anxiety attacks are often

287
00:20:46,624 --> 00:20:49,525
accompanied by
flashes of light, black spots...

288
00:20:49,627 --> 00:20:50,992
No, no, no.

289
00:20:51,262 --> 00:20:53,526
I saw someone in the viewing room.

290
00:20:54,465 --> 00:20:58,060
- There were people there.
- This person couldn't have been there.

291
00:21:00,838 --> 00:21:04,604
Yeah, Lincoln, you've heard of,
post-traumatic stress disorder, right?

292
00:21:04,975 --> 00:21:05,999
Yeah.

293
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:08,010
I'm gonna call you a prime candidate.

294
00:21:08,112 --> 00:21:10,910
I don't think a lot of people
have been through what you just did.

295
00:21:11,015 --> 00:21:13,643
So if you thought you saw someone,

296
00:21:13,751 --> 00:21:17,209
it's possible that it was your subconscious
giving you what you wanted,

297
00:21:17,321 --> 00:21:19,016
whoever it was that

298
00:21:19,423 --> 00:21:23,257
you wanted to be there with you
in that moment to comfort you.

299
00:21:27,465 --> 00:21:29,433
Who was it you thought you saw?

300
00:21:33,537 --> 00:21:35,368
Thanks, Doc. Thank you.

301
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,641
Sure thing.

302
00:21:54,425 --> 00:21:56,791
Seen a lot of rackets in my time,

303
00:21:57,561 --> 00:22:00,462
but if you're doing what I think
you're doing with those postcards,

304
00:22:00,564 --> 00:22:02,794
yours definitely takes the cake.

305
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,164
Yeah, how about
saving the small talk, old head,

306
00:22:05,269 --> 00:22:07,703
'cause you and I
ain't got nothing in common.

307
00:22:07,805 --> 00:22:09,295
What do you do?

308
00:22:09,907 --> 00:22:12,842
Write them here
and then send them to a pal in Iraq

309
00:22:12,943 --> 00:22:15,605
and have him mail them your wife's way?

310
00:22:16,447 --> 00:22:18,677
You know, why don't you
just shut your word hole?

311
00:22:18,783 --> 00:22:20,808
'Cause you don't know nothing
about my racket.

312
00:22:20,918 --> 00:22:23,751
A con pretending
he ain't in the hole to his family.

313
00:22:24,121 --> 00:22:26,112
I seen that once or twice.

314
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:27,621
But Iraq?

315
00:22:28,092 --> 00:22:30,026
Yeah, you the one to talk.

316
00:22:30,428 --> 00:22:33,124
Dede, is that your wife or your kid?

317
00:22:34,465 --> 00:22:36,057
Now you listen,

318
00:22:36,167 --> 00:22:39,159
I don't even want you
to say her name in this prison.

319
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,532
You feel me?

320
00:22:42,072 --> 00:22:43,369
A daughter.

321
00:22:44,341 --> 00:22:46,172
Definitely a daughter.

322
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:53,441
- Yeah, what do you know?
- 'Cause I got one myself.

323
00:22:54,552 --> 00:22:57,715
You know,
after you break outside these walls,

324
00:22:58,055 --> 00:23:00,580
that's the first place
they're gonna look for you.

325
00:23:00,691 --> 00:23:01,885
Family.

326
00:23:02,726 --> 00:23:04,694
Now why is it you think

327
00:23:04,795 --> 00:23:07,821
that I'm that dumb
that I would go directly there?

328
00:23:07,932 --> 00:23:11,368
'Cause that's exactly the first place
I'm gonna go.

329
00:23:14,338 --> 00:23:17,796
Turns out maybe we got
something in common after all.

330
00:23:30,354 --> 00:23:32,481
See Number 11 over there?

331
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:35,184
Keep your eye on him. Watch him closely.

332
00:23:36,126 --> 00:23:39,653
Mid-level reliever at best.
But he's always working at it.

333
00:23:39,763 --> 00:23:43,062
That's why he's your old man's
favorite player. Work ethic.

334
00:23:55,746 --> 00:23:57,043
William Prall.

335
00:23:57,748 --> 00:23:58,942
You know him?

336
00:24:03,287 --> 00:24:05,949
The pipe system
beneath the psych ward is...

337
00:24:06,724 --> 00:24:08,419
Well, it's complex.

338
00:24:09,126 --> 00:24:10,821
Be real easy to get lost.

339
00:24:12,062 --> 00:24:15,156
- How complex can it be?
- Very.

340
00:24:17,668 --> 00:24:20,865
When they built this place in 1858,
the pipes were lead.

341
00:24:20,971 --> 00:24:23,906
A century later,
they discovered lead was a health risk

342
00:24:24,008 --> 00:24:27,000
so they went to copper.
They never removed the lead pipes.

343
00:24:27,111 --> 00:24:28,942
Cost too much.

344
00:24:29,046 --> 00:24:31,514
There's thousands of yards
of the stuff still down there.

345
00:24:31,615 --> 00:24:34,277
And then a few years ago,
they switched to industrial plastic.

346
00:24:34,385 --> 00:24:37,411
Again, it was cheaper
just to lay it over the old stuff.

347
00:24:38,222 --> 00:24:42,158
If I make a wrong turn down there tonight,
I won't make it back by count.

348
00:24:44,261 --> 00:24:46,525
Well, you won't make
the wrong turn, right?

349
00:27:18,315 --> 00:27:20,146
I don't believe my eyes.

350
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:23,549
One of the blues
actually coming into psych ward.

351
00:27:24,254 --> 00:27:25,619
I gotta hit the head

352
00:27:25,723 --> 00:27:28,783
and I didn't want to walk
all the way back to A-wing.

353
00:27:28,892 --> 00:27:32,020
- Mind if I use your facilities?
- Yeah, be my guest.

354
00:27:35,866 --> 00:27:38,767
I don't know why you guys
are so scared of the whack shack.

355
00:27:38,869 --> 00:27:42,066
I mean, between the killers
and the crazies, I'll take the crazies.

356
00:27:42,172 --> 00:27:43,696
Because if a crazy steps out of line,

357
00:27:43,807 --> 00:27:48,608
all I gotta do is shoot him with 40 cc's
of "shut your trap" and it's beddy-bye.

358
00:27:49,513 --> 00:27:51,708
So, which way is the bathroom?

359
00:27:53,083 --> 00:27:55,711
Down the hall,
through the door, make a right.

360
00:30:59,436 --> 00:31:01,961
Hey, blue. What you doing down here?

361
00:31:02,072 --> 00:31:03,096
Hey.

362
00:31:04,308 --> 00:31:06,538
I was just looking for the bathroom.

363
00:31:06,643 --> 00:31:07,940
Down here?

364
00:31:08,045 --> 00:31:11,913
Yeah. You said down the hall,
through the door and to the left.

365
00:31:12,816 --> 00:31:15,751
No, I said through the door
and make a right.

366
00:31:16,987 --> 00:31:18,147
My bad.

367
00:31:19,957 --> 00:31:21,447
Have a good night.

368
00:31:30,534 --> 00:31:32,365
Blue! Hold up!

369
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:36,835
Don't you still gotta take a leak?

370
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:40,103
Yeah. Which way was that again?

371
00:31:41,411 --> 00:31:43,379
With decomposition this extensive,

372
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,143
the most accurate identification tool
is dental records.

373
00:31:47,551 --> 00:31:49,746
We made an imprint
of the deceased's teeth

374
00:31:49,853 --> 00:31:53,254
and compared them to the
dental records of Terrence Steadman.

375
00:31:53,357 --> 00:31:56,224
- And?
- They were a perfect match.

376
00:31:58,462 --> 00:31:59,656
Thank you, Doctor.

377
00:31:59,763 --> 00:32:01,424
That can't be Terrence Steadman.

378
00:32:01,531 --> 00:32:03,431
If you like, you can bring in

379
00:32:03,533 --> 00:32:07,367
a forensic examiner of your own choosing
to examine the body.

380
00:32:08,071 --> 00:32:09,333
But I can tell you now,

381
00:32:09,439 --> 00:32:12,135
they'll come to the same conclusion
that I have.

382
00:32:14,011 --> 00:32:15,308
Thank you.

383
00:32:22,486 --> 00:32:24,477
I hope you're proud of this.

384
00:32:27,491 --> 00:32:30,051
You've gotten your pound of flesh.

385
00:32:30,594 --> 00:32:31,925
Are you done now?

386
00:32:33,196 --> 00:32:36,222
Or would you like
to hurt my family some more?

387
00:32:37,267 --> 00:32:38,757
Come on. Come on.

388
00:34:14,064 --> 00:34:15,656
<i>Hey, Mack, you there?</i>

389
00:34:15,765 --> 00:34:16,754
Yeah.

390
00:34:16,867 --> 00:34:18,562
<i>What's your 20?</i>

391
00:34:18,668 --> 00:34:22,160
I gotta stop by maintenance real quick.
I'll be up in a minute.

392
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,418
You okay?

393
00:35:17,727 --> 00:35:20,059
- I'm burned.
- Oh, God.

394
00:35:21,998 --> 00:35:23,966
All right, help me take this off.

395
00:35:24,067 --> 00:35:26,194
- No, it's like, burned to your skin.
- Take it off.

396
00:35:26,303 --> 00:35:28,737
Are you kidding me? I can't.
It's melted into your skin.

397
00:35:28,838 --> 00:35:31,170
If the guards catch me wearing this,
I'm a dead man.

398
00:35:31,274 --> 00:35:33,640
- Bro, it's just not...
- Do it.

399
00:35:34,077 --> 00:35:35,510
Please do it.

400
00:35:39,082 --> 00:35:40,242
Ready?

401
00:35:41,017 --> 00:35:43,781
One, two...

402
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:05,628
- Michael, it's Sara. How are you feeling?
- Groggy.

403
00:36:06,508 --> 00:36:08,271
It's the anesthesia.

404
00:36:12,347 --> 00:36:14,281
Why did I have anesthesia?

405
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:17,009
We had to perform a procedure.

406
00:36:20,589 --> 00:36:23,820
So, you got so sick
of Scofield's smart mouth

407
00:36:23,925 --> 00:36:26,485
that you decided
to deep fry him, is that it?

408
00:36:26,595 --> 00:36:29,689
- I didn't do anything to him, I swear.
- Let's review.

409
00:36:30,365 --> 00:36:31,923
A locked cell.

410
00:36:33,135 --> 00:36:34,568
Two inmates.

411
00:36:34,669 --> 00:36:37,695
One gets branded
like a South Dakota steer.

412
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,232
You think we should
call Matlock in on this one?

413
00:36:43,612 --> 00:36:44,806
Who's Matlock?

414
00:36:44,913 --> 00:36:47,473
Fernando, you're only going
to make things more difficult

415
00:36:47,582 --> 00:36:48,640
if you don't cooperate.

416
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,877
I told you I didn't burn him.

417
00:36:50,986 --> 00:36:54,012
- I found him like that.
- You found him like that.

418
00:36:54,689 --> 00:36:57,624
He was acting kind of weird
when we lined up for final count.

419
00:36:57,726 --> 00:36:59,091
He was sweating, you know?

420
00:36:59,194 --> 00:37:02,527
But he's not a big talker anyway,
so I didn't think much of it.

421
00:37:02,631 --> 00:37:06,965
Middle of the night, I get up, you know,
to shake hands with the president,

422
00:37:07,069 --> 00:37:09,469
and there he is, face down on the floor.

423
00:37:11,173 --> 00:37:13,334
My ass.

424
00:37:13,442 --> 00:37:15,672
Ask him yourself
when the doc's done with him.

425
00:37:15,777 --> 00:37:17,472
I didn't touch him.

426
00:37:22,584 --> 00:37:23,949
Painkillers?

427
00:37:25,287 --> 00:37:26,754
How bad is it?

428
00:37:27,189 --> 00:37:29,054
I'd take the pills.

429
00:37:30,659 --> 00:37:32,092
Do I get to see it?

430
00:37:32,194 --> 00:37:34,992
No, bandage stays on for now.
Take your pills.

431
00:37:38,133 --> 00:37:40,033
Your cellmate do this to you?

432
00:37:41,403 --> 00:37:42,529
Sucre?

433
00:37:43,105 --> 00:37:44,129
No.

434
00:37:45,073 --> 00:37:46,267
Who did?

435
00:37:49,111 --> 00:37:51,545
This is the part where I don't answer you.

436
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:56,710
All right.

437
00:37:57,552 --> 00:37:59,782
I'll have you sent back to your cell.

438
00:38:01,623 --> 00:38:02,817
All yours.

439
00:38:14,336 --> 00:38:15,667
Hey, Katie, it's me.

440
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:18,034
Listen, can you come up to my office
for a second?

441
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:19,835
I got something I wanna show you.

442
00:38:19,941 --> 00:38:23,138
What the hell am I gonna do now?
I'm a dead man.

443
00:38:23,245 --> 00:38:25,475
I'm sorry, cuz. It was an accident.

444
00:38:26,281 --> 00:38:28,340
Bull's gonna see this and flip his lid.

445
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:30,941
Hey, slim! You got my uni ready?

446
00:38:32,854 --> 00:38:34,947
There's been a bit of a problem, boss.

447
00:38:35,557 --> 00:38:39,323
- What the hell is this?
- I left the iron on it too long.

448
00:38:39,961 --> 00:38:43,419
You are as stupid as you are fat,
do you know that, D-cups?

449
00:38:43,832 --> 00:38:46,164
My new shirt's coming out of your kick.

450
00:38:49,871 --> 00:38:52,271
- You're gonna tell me right now.
- Tell you what?

451
00:38:52,374 --> 00:38:55,969
What the hell you got going on
that's got you burning up guard suits?

452
00:38:57,078 --> 00:38:59,546
<i>Trust me, primo.
The less you know, the better.</i>

453
00:39:11,626 --> 00:39:12,854
Any news?

454
00:39:13,862 --> 00:39:18,094
No. No, not yet.
Testing takes a couple of days.

455
00:39:20,068 --> 00:39:21,831
What do you remember of Dad?

456
00:39:21,937 --> 00:39:24,497
Your dad? I didn't know him.

457
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:29,337
Your mom said some pretty horrible stuff
about him when we were growing up.

458
00:39:29,444 --> 00:39:32,242
I think I saw him when I was in the chair.

459
00:39:33,515 --> 00:39:34,709
Lincoln.

460
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:37,846
It was him. I know it was.

461
00:39:38,787 --> 00:39:42,279
How would you know?
You haven't seen his face in 30 years.

462
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:45,382
- The name that was used, Willie Prall.
- So?

463
00:39:45,493 --> 00:39:48,155
It's the name of this guy
who threw for Chicago back in the day.

464
00:39:48,263 --> 00:39:51,790
Dad and me were really into him
but I'd forgotten all about him.

465
00:39:52,267 --> 00:39:53,894
It's really weird.

466
00:39:55,537 --> 00:39:59,268
Been having these dreams, memories,
things I guess I suppressed when he left.

467
00:39:59,374 --> 00:40:00,466
But...

468
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:06,003
This man who came to the execution,
how do you know he used that name?

469
00:40:06,448 --> 00:40:07,506
Pope told me.

470
00:40:07,616 --> 00:40:10,050
Was that before
or after you had the dream?

471
00:40:12,621 --> 00:40:15,112
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

472
00:40:15,824 --> 00:40:18,554
I don't mean to challenge
what you're saying,

473
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:21,652
but your dad's been MIA
almost your entire life.

474
00:40:21,763 --> 00:40:23,458
I know what I saw, V.

475
00:40:25,634 --> 00:40:26,999
I know what I saw.

476
00:40:34,709 --> 00:40:37,269
This is the security camera footage
of the courthouse

477
00:40:37,412 --> 00:40:39,539
from the night that Judge Kessler
got those documents.

478
00:40:39,648 --> 00:40:41,240
Now, check out this guy.

479
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:44,745
He is very skilled.

480
00:40:45,654 --> 00:40:47,884
He moves casually enough
to avoid suspicion.

481
00:40:47,989 --> 00:40:51,948
You see how he shifts his hat
when he turns corners to hide his face?

482
00:40:52,494 --> 00:40:54,928
He knows exactly
where those cameras are.

483
00:40:58,333 --> 00:40:59,698
Wait. Right there.

484
00:40:59,801 --> 00:41:02,269
See that reflection? Rewind it. Rewind it.

485
00:41:05,206 --> 00:41:07,003
Right. Can you blow that up?

486
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:20,144
- Son of a bitch.
- What?

487
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,555
I know that guy.

488
00:41:28,697 --> 00:41:30,028
What is it?

489
00:41:30,465 --> 00:41:32,558
It was fused into Michael Scofield's skin.

490
00:41:32,667 --> 00:41:34,828
I removed it
during the débridement procedure.

491
00:41:34,936 --> 00:41:36,335
And what about it?

492
00:41:36,671 --> 00:41:39,799
Well, this fabric doesn't come
from a standard issue prison uniform.

493
00:41:39,908 --> 00:41:43,844
- Where'd it come from then?
- As far as I can tell, a guard's uniform.

494
00:41:57,025 --> 00:41:58,424
Open on 40!

495
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,050
40 open!

496
00:42:02,697 --> 00:42:03,959
Close 40!

497
00:42:04,332 --> 00:42:05,663
40 closed!

498
00:42:07,635 --> 00:42:09,102
How you feeling?

499
00:42:37,432 --> 00:42:38,763
What's wrong?

500
00:42:40,001 --> 00:42:41,332
The blueprints,

501
00:42:42,337 --> 00:42:45,670
the ones we need to get
from the psych ward to the infirmary,

502
00:42:46,541 --> 00:42:48,133
our map out of here,

503
00:42:50,278 --> 00:42:51,802
they're gone.
