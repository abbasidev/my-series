1
00:00:04,515 --> 00:00:05,941
Rough night?

2
00:00:08,018 --> 00:00:10,384
I got your message. What's the problem?

3
00:00:10,954 --> 00:00:12,216
Lost my keys.

4
00:00:13,924 --> 00:00:16,449
- Where'd you find them?
- Four feet that way.

5
00:00:18,195 --> 00:00:19,685
Must've dropped them.

6
00:00:21,031 --> 00:00:23,124
How you doing? It's been a while.

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,158
Fine. How are you?

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,037
Cold.

9
00:00:28,405 --> 00:00:29,372
Man, I...

10
00:00:30,441 --> 00:00:31,806
I need to talk to you about something.

11
00:00:31,909 --> 00:00:34,639
- Grab some lunch at Fascetti's?
- I have to get back to work.

12
00:00:35,145 --> 00:00:38,410
Speaking of which,
I heard you got fired a few weeks ago.

13
00:00:38,715 --> 00:00:39,841
What was it this time?

14
00:00:41,351 --> 00:00:42,943
You really want to know?

15
00:00:43,053 --> 00:00:44,953
Or are you just enjoying the view
from your high horse?

16
00:00:46,423 --> 00:00:47,583
You know what I want?

17
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:51,719
To not have to be the older brother
to my older brother.

18
00:01:10,481 --> 00:01:12,176
What you doing here, Crab?

19
00:01:12,382 --> 00:01:14,179
Long time no see, Mr. Linc.
Where you been?

20
00:01:14,284 --> 00:01:16,218
- Here and there.
- Mmm-hmm.

21
00:01:18,989 --> 00:01:20,217
I'm gonna get your 90 grand, all right?

22
00:01:20,324 --> 00:01:22,986
Oh, relax, man,
that debt already been paid.

23
00:01:23,327 --> 00:01:26,228
- By who?
- Someone who likes to do people favors.

24
00:01:29,233 --> 00:01:30,791
I don't know what it is
you think you're getting,

25
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:31,959
but let's be clear about something.

26
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:34,003
It's gonna be a few days
before I get the money lined up.

27
00:01:34,104 --> 00:01:35,799
Let's not kid ourselves.

28
00:01:35,906 --> 00:01:38,602
You can't get anywhere
near that kind of money.

29
00:01:39,843 --> 00:01:41,572
So let's talk about
what you can do for me.

30
00:01:43,447 --> 00:01:45,347
<i>REYNOLDS. ;  Allies are like family.</i>

31
00:01:45,482 --> 00:01:46,881
<i>We have disagreements,</i>

32
00:01:46,984 --> 00:01:49,976
<i>but we always seem to
smooth things out by Thanksgiving.</i>

33
00:01:50,087 --> 00:01:52,920
Okay, if you had to choose,

34
00:01:53,257 --> 00:01:56,886
Vice President Reynolds or Kathy in HR?

35
00:01:57,461 --> 00:02:00,897
- I'll take door number three.
- Come on. If you had to choose.

36
00:02:01,064 --> 00:02:04,659
That chick in HR.
Michael never cared much for blondes.

37
00:02:05,802 --> 00:02:07,997
- V.
- How you doing, Michael?

38
00:02:09,339 --> 00:02:11,170
Good. I'm good. How are you?

39
00:02:11,408 --> 00:02:13,876
I'm okay.
You know, I'm over at Glazer and Ross.

40
00:02:13,977 --> 00:02:17,538
Lawyer number 97. Benefits are good.

41
00:02:19,883 --> 00:02:21,145
How's Lincoln?

44
00:02:27,124 --> 00:02:28,182
How is he?

45
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,687
He's...

46
00:02:33,163 --> 00:02:35,222
He's Linc.

47
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:38,931
I don't care who the guy is.
I ain't killing no one.

48
00:02:39,036 --> 00:02:41,163
I must have missed the part
where I gave you a choice.

49
00:02:41,271 --> 00:02:42,761
Black leather jacket.

50
00:02:43,273 --> 00:02:46,037
Two buttons down the front,
three on each sleeve.

51
00:02:47,277 --> 00:02:49,939
One missing on his right... No, left arm.

52
00:02:52,616 --> 00:02:54,675
Jeans. Faded.

53
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,111
Stain on the left knee.

54
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,718
He does bad things to good people.

55
00:03:06,029 --> 00:03:08,395
Think of this as a $90,000 bullet.

56
00:03:09,266 --> 00:03:10,597
You start fresh,

57
00:03:11,535 --> 00:03:14,663
and you keep me from finding out
if there's someone in your life

58
00:03:14,771 --> 00:03:16,432
you will do something for.

59
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,176
Oh, I should call you a cab.

60
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,748
You know how you can tell God is a man?

61
00:03:29,186 --> 00:03:30,244
Shoes.

62
00:03:33,223 --> 00:03:34,190
Easy.

63
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:51,799
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:53,977 --> 00:03:55,501
What?

65
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:56,846
It's...

66
00:03:59,149 --> 00:04:00,810
You gonna answer it?

67
00:04:04,221 --> 00:04:05,779
He'll leave a message.

68
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,352
He always does.

69
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,593
Michael, it's Linc.

70
00:04:11,862 --> 00:04:13,693
I need your help, bro.
I'm in something real bad.

71
00:04:14,264 --> 00:04:15,856
I can't get out of it.

72
00:04:16,233 --> 00:04:20,169
- I need you to straighten me out.
- My head is all messed up and...

73
00:04:20,337 --> 00:04:23,272
Anyway, it's real important, bro.
You gotta call me.

74
00:04:23,607 --> 00:04:25,165
You gotta call me now.

75
00:04:35,018 --> 00:04:36,178
I can't do this.

76
00:04:37,187 --> 00:04:38,154
I know.

77
00:04:39,423 --> 00:04:40,390
I know.

78
00:04:49,032 --> 00:04:50,522
I'll call you a cab.

79
00:05:11,203 --> 00:05:16,303


80
00:06:35,566 --> 00:06:38,228
- Did we get him?
- I believe we did, partner.

81
00:06:48,645 --> 00:06:49,976
Are you kidding me?

82
00:06:51,615 --> 00:06:53,583
Nando, we should've
whooped that guy's ass.

83
00:06:53,684 --> 00:06:56,812
Please. Only time I seen you
whoop some ass

84
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,753
is when that old man
cut in front of you at Arby's.

85
00:06:59,857 --> 00:07:02,121
Yeah,
and he was like 102 and blind.

86
00:07:03,127 --> 00:07:04,560
With a plastic hip.

87
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,692
Oh, my God.

88
00:07:08,665 --> 00:07:09,632
What?

89
00:07:27,151 --> 00:07:31,554
<i>WOMAN. ;  Dr. Davis, telephone,
please. Dr. Davis, telephone, please.</i>

90
00:07:33,223 --> 00:07:35,521
- Hey, they're waiting for you in 4B.
- Oh, pull his film.

91
00:07:35,626 --> 00:07:37,685
- I'll be there in a minute.
- Okay.

92
00:08:50,033 --> 00:08:52,866
Sergeant Franklin,
you never cease to amaze me.

93
00:08:53,003 --> 00:08:55,233
Is there anything you can't get here?

94
00:08:55,806 --> 00:08:57,933
All right, a deal's a deal.

95
00:08:59,309 --> 00:09:02,608
Prison guard duty. Away from the front.
Safest place you could be.

96
00:09:02,713 --> 00:09:03,702
Thank you.

97
00:09:03,814 --> 00:09:06,908
And my wife and daughter
back home thank you too, sir.

98
00:09:16,793 --> 00:09:19,159
These coal seams are pretty significant.

99
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,161
- Hey.
- Hi.

100
00:09:22,432 --> 00:09:24,798
Would you give us a minute? Thanks.

101
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:28,561
Have you been watching the news?

102
00:09:28,872 --> 00:09:30,737
- Why?
- It's Lincoln.

103
00:09:34,044 --> 00:09:37,013
- I didn't do it.
- Terrence Steadman.

104
00:09:38,215 --> 00:09:40,115
The Vice President's brother.

105
00:09:42,286 --> 00:09:44,015
Do you have any idea
what they're gonna do to you?

106
00:09:44,121 --> 00:09:46,681
I didn't do it, man. It was a setup.
I didn't do it.

107
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:47,984
You knew him.

108
00:09:48,592 --> 00:09:49,854
- Who?
- Steadman.

109
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,949
No.

110
00:09:51,061 --> 00:09:52,551
- You worked for his company.
- So what?

111
00:09:52,663 --> 00:09:54,255
From which you were fired
a few weeks ago.

112
00:09:54,364 --> 00:09:55,797
I loaded containers in the warehouse.

113
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:57,389
Never met the guy. What the hell, Mike?

114
00:09:57,501 --> 00:09:59,469
You sound like
one of the damn detectives.

115
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,902
- I'm just saying.
- You think I did it?

116
00:10:07,444 --> 00:10:09,503
I heard you owe someone 90 grand.

117
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,118
- Who told you that?
- People talk.

118
00:10:16,486 --> 00:10:18,317
And I know Steadman had a lot of money.

119
00:10:18,422 --> 00:10:20,822
I may be a lot of things,
but I'm not a murderer.

120
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:23,222
Then what were you doing
in that garage last night?

121
00:10:25,762 --> 00:10:28,287
You admitted to the police you were there.

122
00:10:31,868 --> 00:10:33,130
Honestly, Linc,

123
00:10:34,871 --> 00:10:36,338
I don't know how it's come to this.

124
00:10:37,274 --> 00:10:39,606
And you can't keep
blaming Mom for dying

125
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:42,304
and Dad for leaving,
because I was there, too.

126
00:10:43,347 --> 00:10:45,042
Difference is, I got out.

127
00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:49,976
Mom had life insurance.
I took my half, put myself through school.

128
00:10:52,189 --> 00:10:54,419
What did you do with your half, Linc?

129
00:10:57,894 --> 00:11:00,226
Everything's not how it looks, Michael.

130
00:11:01,431 --> 00:11:03,558
I hope for your sake that's true.

131
00:11:04,501 --> 00:11:05,525
Here...

132
00:11:05,669 --> 00:11:09,867
- Here is where we want the turn to anger.
- Trust me, that won't be a problem.

133
00:11:10,641 --> 00:11:13,474
Now remember to stress his record
as a repeat offender.

134
00:11:13,577 --> 00:11:16,375
We need the public behind us
if we want the death penalty.

135
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,108
And where are we
with Governor Tancredi?

136
00:11:20,717 --> 00:11:23,550
He has aspirations. He won't be a problem.

137
00:11:24,821 --> 00:11:26,982
Thirty seconds,
Madam Vice President.

138
00:11:29,493 --> 00:11:31,723
The papers
have already crucified him.

139
00:11:31,828 --> 00:11:33,625
The police say they got a phone call
right after the murder

140
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:36,597
from someone claiming they saw Lincoln
running from the parking garage.

141
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,190
He was into someone for 90 grand.

142
00:11:38,301 --> 00:11:41,498
What do you need that kind of money for?
Drugs, bribes?

143
00:11:42,005 --> 00:11:44,838
Forget about what you want to be true.
Let's look at this objectively.

144
00:11:44,941 --> 00:11:46,806
- Maybe you should too.
- I am.

145
00:11:47,244 --> 00:11:49,439
All right, you know what?
I promised I wouldn't say anything,

146
00:11:49,546 --> 00:11:51,241
but I'm getting tired of you
talking about him

147
00:11:51,348 --> 00:11:54,146
like he's some guy from the neighborhood
that you used to know.

148
00:11:54,251 --> 00:11:55,411
- He's your brother.
- I know.

149
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,544
And I know he helped you out
with your dad back in the day,

150
00:11:57,654 --> 00:11:59,485
but you should see
the kind of person he is now,

151
00:11:59,589 --> 00:12:01,386
the kind of people he keeps friends with.

152
00:12:01,491 --> 00:12:02,958
You want to know
what the 90 grand was for?

153
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,823
- I think I do.
- You.

154
00:12:05,729 --> 00:12:06,696
What do you mean?

155
00:12:06,797 --> 00:12:08,458
The money you got
when you were 18 years old

156
00:12:08,565 --> 00:12:10,430
from your mother's life insurance?

157
00:12:10,534 --> 00:12:12,434
The money that paid for your degree,
that got you this job,

158
00:12:12,536 --> 00:12:14,299
that bought you your loft?

159
00:12:14,404 --> 00:12:17,237
Your mother never had life insurance.
That money came from Lincoln.

160
00:12:19,476 --> 00:12:20,966
- How?
- He borrowed it.

161
00:12:21,244 --> 00:12:23,212
He knew it would be tough to pay back,
but that didn't matter,

162
00:12:23,313 --> 00:12:25,406
because he thought you deserved it.

163
00:12:25,515 --> 00:12:29,007
He also knew you'd never accept it
if you knew it came from him.

164
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,011
Michael, you are where you are
because of your brother.

165
00:12:34,825 --> 00:12:37,623
You're telling me
he is where he is because of me?

166
00:12:47,172 --> 00:12:48,298
Why?

167
00:12:50,175 --> 00:12:52,075
Why didn't you tell me about the money?

168
00:12:53,479 --> 00:12:55,777
- No need to.
- Oh, Linc.

169
00:12:55,881 --> 00:12:57,473
Who told you? Veronica?

170
00:13:00,052 --> 00:13:02,418
What did she make of all this? About me?

171
00:13:02,688 --> 00:13:05,748
- I don't know.
- Glad she got out when she did, huh?

172
00:13:06,658 --> 00:13:08,717
You know how she feels about you.

173
00:13:09,428 --> 00:13:12,124
It's been the same way
ever since we were kids.

174
00:13:13,465 --> 00:13:14,432
Yeah.

175
00:13:18,337 --> 00:13:19,304
Linc,

176
00:13:20,939 --> 00:13:23,430
- I owe you an apology.
- For what?

177
00:13:25,277 --> 00:13:26,767
The night you called.

178
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,374
If we'd talked,

179
00:13:29,748 --> 00:13:31,909
- maybe I could have stopped you.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

180
00:13:32,017 --> 00:13:33,484
This ain't your fault.

181
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,851
Then who's is it?

182
00:13:37,456 --> 00:13:40,391
Listen up. You need to forget about this.

183
00:13:41,226 --> 00:13:44,389
Move on. Work hard. Do what you do.

184
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,164
I can't do that.

185
00:13:49,435 --> 00:13:51,699
Oh, yes, you can. And you will.

186
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:01,405
Here's the part I don't understand.

187
00:14:02,114 --> 00:14:05,743
<i>All the evidence is lining up
in a path that leads directly to you.</i>

188
00:14:06,185 --> 00:14:08,153
They say they have you on tape.

189
00:14:12,357 --> 00:14:13,824
<i>Pulling the trigger.</i>

190
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,988
If you didn't kill Terrence Steadman,

191
00:14:22,668 --> 00:14:25,159
how the hell did someone
make it look like you did?

192
00:14:30,609 --> 00:14:31,576
Perfect.

193
00:14:32,444 --> 00:14:34,378
Perfect's a strong word, coz.

194
00:14:34,813 --> 00:14:38,749
- I got strong feelings, bro.
- I'm telling you, she might be the one.

195
00:14:39,218 --> 00:14:42,949
- She from the block?
- Nope. Uptown. Pill Hill.

196
00:14:44,623 --> 00:14:46,921
You think you could hold on
to a girl from the PH?

197
00:14:47,025 --> 00:14:50,893
I want to take her out to dinner.
You'll see. Someplace real nice.

198
00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:52,394
Come on, Fernando.

199
00:14:53,966 --> 00:14:56,560
How are you going to afford
a place like that?

200
00:15:05,944 --> 00:15:06,968
- Open the drawer!
- Hey, hey, okay!

201
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:08,671
<i>- Open the drawer, coño!
- Okay, okay!</i>

202
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,748
- Quick! Quick!
- All right, okay!

203
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,342
- Now!
- Here.

204
00:15:15,721 --> 00:15:18,087
Actually, this is all I need.

205
00:15:18,991 --> 00:15:19,958
Okay.

206
00:15:23,862 --> 00:15:25,921
<i>C- NOTE. ; I appreciate your business, man.</i>

207
00:15:28,033 --> 00:15:30,763
I'll have that in here for you
about next week.

208
00:16:54,319 --> 00:16:58,221
I brought you a gift from the hospital.

209
00:16:59,124 --> 00:17:03,424
I brought you a gift from the hospital.

210
00:17:05,697 --> 00:17:07,289
I'm telling you, it is like Christmas.

211
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,467
And you work at the North Pole.

212
00:17:11,637 --> 00:17:14,834
If the North Pole had gunshot wounds
and cancer patients...

213
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,408
Seriously, I don't know
how you work there.

214
00:17:17,843 --> 00:17:19,174
What do you mean?

215
00:17:20,846 --> 00:17:22,370
I like to help people.

216
00:17:23,015 --> 00:17:24,915
You like helping yourself.

217
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:29,912
And you like helping your friends.

218
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:39,524
Oh, my God.

219
00:17:43,335 --> 00:17:44,427
Oh, my God.

220
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:46,294
Can you hear us? Are you okay?

221
00:17:47,673 --> 00:17:49,573
Can you hear us? Are you okay?

222
00:17:50,242 --> 00:17:53,143
<i>- Help, somebody!
- Who's got a telephone? Call 911!</i>

223
00:17:53,445 --> 00:17:55,413
Oh, my God! Can anybody help...

224
00:17:59,685 --> 00:18:02,017
Call 911! Help!

225
00:18:03,655 --> 00:18:05,282
Are you a doctor?

226
00:18:07,526 --> 00:18:08,823
<i>Can you help him?</i>

227
00:18:26,445 --> 00:18:27,878
Well, do something!

228
00:18:56,374 --> 00:18:57,602
At ease.

229
00:18:57,743 --> 00:19:00,371
The whiskey that you ordered, sir,
will be here in a couple of days.

230
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:04,245
That's fine. I actually brought you here
to talk to you about something else.

231
00:19:04,349 --> 00:19:07,546
- Prisoner-abuse report you filed?
- Yes, sir.

232
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,711
I need to know how far
you're willing to go with this.

233
00:19:10,822 --> 00:19:12,289
Whatever it takes, sir.

234
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,449
I particularly have no love
for the desert donkeys,

235
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,550
but I do have some
for the Geneva Convention.

236
00:19:16,661 --> 00:19:19,129
Something like this gets out,
it might open up our boys

237
00:19:19,231 --> 00:19:22,598
- to similar treatment from the enemy.
- I understand that, sir.

238
00:19:22,934 --> 00:19:25,767
But I'm not planning
on calling a press conference.

239
00:19:26,004 --> 00:19:27,437
What I'm saying is,

240
00:19:28,406 --> 00:19:29,896
what I saw was wrong,

241
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:33,110
and someone
needs to take responsibility for it, sir.

242
00:19:34,746 --> 00:19:35,804
All right.

243
00:19:36,782 --> 00:19:39,273
Please take Mr. Franklin into custody.

244
00:19:39,484 --> 00:19:40,451
Yes, sir.

245
00:19:40,619 --> 00:19:42,052
What? What the hell is going on, sir?

246
00:19:42,154 --> 00:19:44,019
Sergeant Franklin,
I'm hereby recommending

247
00:19:44,122 --> 00:19:47,216
that you be dishonorably discharged
from the United States Army.

248
00:19:47,325 --> 00:19:50,624
- What? For what?
- For engaging in illegal black-market...

249
00:19:50,729 --> 00:19:53,926
- You asked me to get that stuff, man!
- I kept it to myself.

250
00:19:54,366 --> 00:19:56,630
Maybe you should learn to do the same.

251
00:19:58,069 --> 00:19:59,764
You can't do this.

252
00:19:59,905 --> 00:20:02,669
You can't do this! You cannot do this!

253
00:20:06,478 --> 00:20:08,446
Has the jury reached a verdict?

254
00:20:08,547 --> 00:20:10,674
- We have, Your Honor.
- What say you?

255
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:15,147
<i>In the matter of The People
of the State of Illinois vs. Lincoln Burrows,</i>

256
00:20:15,253 --> 00:20:17,278
on the count of murder in the first degree,

257
00:20:17,389 --> 00:20:19,721
we find the defendant guilty.

258
00:20:20,992 --> 00:20:24,553
The defendant will remain in custody
until one week from today,

259
00:20:24,796 --> 00:20:26,923
when we commence the penalty phase.

260
00:20:30,869 --> 00:20:31,893
Lincoln.

261
00:20:44,649 --> 00:20:46,082
I'm so sorry, Linc.

262
00:20:46,618 --> 00:20:48,745
Don't be. It's not your fault.

263
00:20:59,264 --> 00:21:00,595
Know what I like?

264
00:21:03,501 --> 00:21:05,093
How after we make love,

265
00:21:05,871 --> 00:21:08,066
you get this little puddle of water
in your belly button.

266
00:21:08,907 --> 00:21:10,636
Fernando, that's sweat.

267
00:21:10,976 --> 00:21:13,001
And get out of there! It's disgusting there!

268
00:21:13,111 --> 00:21:14,305
I think it's beautiful.

269
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,245
I think you're beautiful.

270
00:21:22,621 --> 00:21:24,384
What do you want, Fernando?

271
00:21:26,057 --> 00:21:28,218
Oh, you got to give me
a few more minutes...

272
00:21:28,326 --> 00:21:29,623
Stop.

273
00:21:31,029 --> 00:21:32,360
From the future.

274
00:21:33,531 --> 00:21:35,590
What do you want from the future?

275
00:21:38,403 --> 00:21:40,200
Would you run if I said "you"?

276
00:21:42,207 --> 00:21:44,004
Would you chase me if I did?

277
00:21:46,711 --> 00:21:47,973
<i>DARIUS. ; I don't get it.</i>

278
00:21:48,647 --> 00:21:50,080
All these commercials show brothers

279
00:21:50,181 --> 00:21:52,649
learning computer skills,
new technologies.

280
00:21:53,752 --> 00:21:56,778
Uncle Sam didn't teach me nothing
but cadence and kill.

281
00:21:57,289 --> 00:22:00,053
- You check over at the Price-Mart?
- Ain't hiring.

282
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:04,194
Especially with a brother
with a dishonorable discharge.

283
00:22:04,296 --> 00:22:06,526
Goes right to the bottom of the pile, man.

284
00:22:06,698 --> 00:22:08,325
How long you think you can keep this up?

285
00:22:08,433 --> 00:22:10,264
Until somebody gives me a job.

286
00:22:10,368 --> 00:22:12,598
No, I'm talking about lying to Kaycee.

287
00:22:12,737 --> 00:22:15,570
Your unit's been on leave
for a long damn time now.

288
00:22:16,074 --> 00:22:17,701
Pretty soon they gonna stop thinking
you're lucky,

289
00:22:17,809 --> 00:22:19,276
and she's gonna start asking questions.

290
00:22:19,377 --> 00:22:22,141
Yeah, well, then I need to start
finding some answers.

291
00:22:22,247 --> 00:22:25,114
Look, I happen to know
of an employment opportunity.

292
00:22:25,684 --> 00:22:28,346
Come on, man, you know
I don't get down like that.

293
00:22:28,453 --> 00:22:30,080
- It's just driving a truck.
- Yeah.

294
00:22:30,188 --> 00:22:31,712
A to B. That's it.

295
00:22:32,357 --> 00:22:35,224
Uncle Sam taught you
how to drive trucks, didn't he?

296
00:22:35,961 --> 00:22:38,657
Yeah. And he also taught me
to look inside.

297
00:22:40,699 --> 00:22:43,065
It might be illegal, but it's also rent.

298
00:22:43,435 --> 00:22:45,096
A to B, your call.

299
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:48,005
Yeah.

300
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,172
- They didn't even let her testify.
- Who?

301
00:22:51,977 --> 00:22:53,239
Leticia Barris.

302
00:22:53,945 --> 00:22:55,105
And that cop?

303
00:22:55,246 --> 00:22:58,079
- Changed his story a dozen times.
- What part of "move on" don't you get?

304
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:05,350
After Mom died,
when it was just you and me,

305
00:23:06,691 --> 00:23:08,818
I remember having trouble sleeping.

306
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,925
Never knowing where you were.

307
00:23:12,597 --> 00:23:14,758
But when I'd wake up in the morning,

308
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,890
there'd be this paper bird,

309
00:23:18,169 --> 00:23:21,195
an origami crane, sitting next to my bed.

310
00:23:22,874 --> 00:23:25,206
And I never knew what it meant exactly,

311
00:23:26,044 --> 00:23:27,602
but I figured it was your way
of letting me know

312
00:23:27,712 --> 00:23:29,475
you were checking in on me.

313
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,842
Anyway,

314
00:23:34,586 --> 00:23:35,848
I looked it up.

315
00:23:36,454 --> 00:23:37,512
The crane.

316
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,983
It stands for familial obligation.

317
00:23:42,794 --> 00:23:44,489
Watching out for your own.

318
00:23:47,298 --> 00:23:49,732
Maybe it's my turn to watch out for you.

319
00:23:53,705 --> 00:23:55,468
So same time tomorrow.

320
00:23:57,509 --> 00:23:58,476
No, man,

321
00:23:58,576 --> 00:24:02,376
they're transferring me to a prison
where I'll wait until they execute me.

322
00:24:04,015 --> 00:24:06,040
- Can I still visit?
- Yeah.

323
00:24:06,384 --> 00:24:08,852
It ain't that far. Place called Fox River.

324
00:24:10,755 --> 00:24:12,188
- Fox River?
- Yeah.

325
00:24:14,692 --> 00:24:15,659
Why?

326
00:24:17,762 --> 00:24:18,729
Nothing.

327
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,918
How come there's four?

328
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:28,690
Well, Mommy's new friend
is coming over for dinner again.

329
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:32,870
Again? He just came over last night.

330
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:35,732
- I like him.
- Well, I do, too.

331
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:38,502
And I want you both to be extra polite,

332
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:41,577
because he's stopping by Malarkey's
on his way home from work,

333
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,271
and he's bringing us a really good meal.

334
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:48,044
In fact, you two go wash your hands.

335
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:03,261
Evening, Mrs. Hollander.

336
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:06,763
Don't you look lovely this evening.

337
00:25:45,476 --> 00:25:46,807
I'm gonna do it.

338
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:48,212
Do what?

339
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,015
I'm gonna propose to Maricruz.

340
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:53,147
Are you serious?

341
00:25:53,751 --> 00:25:54,718
When?

342
00:25:55,286 --> 00:25:57,083
As soon as I can afford the ring.

343
00:25:57,188 --> 00:25:59,053
So what, like 10, 20 years?

344
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:04,495
What's your problem, man?
Why can't you just be happy for me?

345
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:06,587
I'm just trying to protect you.

346
00:26:06,931 --> 00:26:09,058
What, you think you can give her
everything she wants?

347
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:11,226
Takes more than money to do that.

348
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,535
You know I love you, coz.

349
00:26:23,047 --> 00:26:24,947
Just think
you should look at the reality here.

350
00:26:25,049 --> 00:26:26,243
<i>Seriously, primo,</i>

351
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:29,548
how are you gonna afford
a ring for a girl like that, huh?

352
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:40,060
- Open the door!
- Hey, okay, okay!

353
00:26:40,164 --> 00:26:41,131
<i>Oye, coño, now!</i>

354
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:42,663
Hey, this fine?

355
00:26:44,435 --> 00:26:46,426
Actually, I'm gonna need
a little bit more this time.

356
00:26:46,537 --> 00:26:47,629
Okay, okay.

357
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:52,769
Here you go.

358
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:57,646
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

359
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:28,140
- Anyone asking questions?
- Not loud enough to hear.

360
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:30,648
God,

361
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:34,811
I can't remember the last time
I was this much of a nervous wreck.

362
00:27:35,386 --> 00:27:37,581
School board, second term, 1992?

363
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,357
Secluded, no real access roads,
perfect for what you're looking for.

364
00:27:45,763 --> 00:27:47,492
Only one problem.

365
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:49,725
- What's that?
- It's over $2 million.

366
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:52,929
Well, didn't my poor brother, Terrence,

367
00:27:53,037 --> 00:27:54,834
leave something for me in his will?

368
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:57,373
You'd have to ask
your accountants, ma'am.

369
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,909
Tell them to use that money.

370
00:28:00,344 --> 00:28:03,711
I'm paying for his mistake.
He can pay for the damn house.

371
00:28:04,882 --> 00:28:07,680
And I've been clean for 18 months now.

372
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:12,286
I'll tell you, I've never been happier.

373
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:15,292
That actually might be the wrong word.

374
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:16,724
I'll be honest,
there were times I was using,

375
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:18,523
I felt pretty damn happy.

376
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:24,096
But what I feel is different now. I feel...

377
00:28:25,937 --> 00:28:27,029
I feel joy.

378
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:32,338
So here I am. I know that

379
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:36,340
all I can do every day
is the next right thing.

380
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:40,513
And I think for me right now,
that means going back to work.

381
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:42,977
I...

382
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:46,117
I don't know, maybe counseling.

383
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:51,592
I want to help people
get from where I've been to where I am.

384
00:28:55,032 --> 00:28:56,329
Hey, Sara.

385
00:28:57,201 --> 00:28:59,169
You used to be a doctor, right?

386
00:28:59,737 --> 00:29:03,002
- I still am, in theory. Why?
- Well, I was just thinking,

387
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:05,966
I might know of a job opening
where I work.

388
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,669
Really? Where's that?

389
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:10,246
- You ever heard of Fox River?
- The prison?

390
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:13,146
Yeah. I know it sounds like a strange idea.

391
00:29:13,751 --> 00:29:14,911
Maybe...

392
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,281
Maybe you and I could...

393
00:29:17,688 --> 00:29:19,781
Maybe we could talk about it over dinner.

394
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:23,224
I got a gift card to the Red Lobster
over off the interstate.

395
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:24,753
Oh, my God.

396
00:29:26,063 --> 00:29:28,054
Thank you. Really.

397
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,267
I...

398
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:33,335
Tonight's kind of my night
to work on my resume.

399
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,907
Yeah.

400
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:39,669
- Of course.
- Sorry, I...

401
00:29:40,711 --> 00:29:43,942
But thank you, really, for the referral.

402
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:45,874
Fox River.

403
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:47,651
Yeah.

404
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:49,074
You know,
math was never my best subject, either.

405
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:53,182
But I got through it
by learning some new tricks.

406
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:57,016
- You want to learn some tricks, Gracey?
- Like what?

407
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:58,952
Like your nine-times tables.

408
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:03,551
Ready? Nine times one is...

409
00:31:04,061 --> 00:31:05,323
Nine.

410
00:31:05,796 --> 00:31:09,664
- Nine times two is...
- Eighteen.

411
00:31:10,434 --> 00:31:12,732
Nine times three is...

412
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:15,133
Twenty-seven!

413
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:18,633
Exactly. You got it. Now keep on going.

414
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:21,275
Mommy, Mommy,
did you see what Teddy taught me?

415
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:24,041
Yes. That's great, honey.
Go show your brother.

416
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:28,751
- Zack, look. Nine times one...
- Thank you.

417
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:31,448
Nine?

418
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:35,384
- Nine times two?
- Eighteen.

419
00:31:36,894 --> 00:31:38,759
Nine times three?

420
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:43,332
Nine times four?

421
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:47,170
<i>MAN. ;  Welcome back to
America's Most Wanted.</i>

422
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:20,169
Right, right, left, left, right, right.

423
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:27,171
Right, right, left, left.

424
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:28,412
Left.

425
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:32,543
Left, left, right, left right, boiler room,
left, left, left, right.

426
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:37,383
Left, left...

427
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:00,268
- There you go.
- Hey. Thank you.

428
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:05,006
Let me get your change.

429
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:25,660
Do you want your change?

430
00:33:29,106 --> 00:33:30,300
Keep it.

431
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,351
And this is his.

432
00:33:47,224 --> 00:33:50,489
Love it. That's different.

433
00:33:53,597 --> 00:33:54,655
- Hey.
- Hey.

434
00:33:54,765 --> 00:33:56,528
- Daddy!
- Hey, sweetheart.

435
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:58,966
- Come here.
- Hey, there.

436
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:00,898
Hey.

437
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:03,904
You know I got...

438
00:34:06,877 --> 00:34:08,071
I got to tell you something,

439
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:12,745
and it's gonna be really hard to hear.

440
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:15,980
Okay.

441
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,420
What?

442
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:28,788
Well, the thing is,

443
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:38,240
I'm being shipped back off.

444
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,211
- What?
- Yeah.

445
00:34:42,446 --> 00:34:45,813
My unit just got called back
for another tour, baby.

446
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:47,917
I can't believe it.

447
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:49,786
Deployment orders just came down.

448
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:51,718
You know, with the Italians
pulling out and everything.

449
00:34:51,822 --> 00:34:53,414
Tell them no, Daddy.

450
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:58,888
- Yo, B.
- Come here.

451
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:02,962
Can you give me a hand
with something out back?

452
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:04,227
Okay.

453
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:17,878
That's my sister you lied to in there.

454
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:22,678
Which is why I know you're going to
take care of them when I'm gone.

455
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:25,083
This is crazy.

456
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:29,350
Maybe. But so is the way
I got kicked out of the Army.

457
00:35:29,793 --> 00:35:32,557
So is the way
I got busted for driving that truck.

458
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:36,095
And so is the way
I feel about that woman up in there.

459
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:38,797
She married a military man

460
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:42,839
who knows
how to take care of his business.

461
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:48,244
Now if I look like one of these thugs, now,
what do think she's going to do? Huh?

462
00:35:48,345 --> 00:35:50,245
How long do you think
she's going to wait for me

463
00:35:50,347 --> 00:35:51,314
while I'm inside?

464
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,115
I don't know, man.

465
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:57,677
You owe me this, man.

466
00:35:59,089 --> 00:36:02,252
Don't you ever let her know where I am.

467
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,222
Do you feel me?

468
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:44,600
Usually, I do this the other way.

469
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:47,704
- Why do you want to...
- I want what I want.

470
00:36:54,678 --> 00:36:59,172
You show this to anyone else,
I am calling the whole thing off.

471
00:38:21,131 --> 00:38:22,598
My therapist said...

472
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:26,498
She said that I'm holding too much in

473
00:38:27,604 --> 00:38:29,572
and that I need to confront you

474
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:32,502
to let you know how betrayed I feel.

475
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:36,037
I let you into my life,

476
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:38,172
my home,

477
00:38:38,615 --> 00:38:40,412
my God, I let you near my children!

478
00:38:40,517 --> 00:38:44,180
- I never touched them.
- You should have told me what you were.

479
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:49,284
You think that you're the only one
who feels betrayed?

480
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:57,494
I loved you, Susan.

481
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:01,564
Real love.

482
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:04,397
For the first time in my life.

483
00:39:11,014 --> 00:39:13,414
And then to have you do me like that,

484
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:16,748
to just throw me out to the dogs,
just toss me out the back door...

485
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:19,015
- You're a murderer, Teddy!
- That's enough!

486
00:39:22,993 --> 00:39:24,688
I have sinned in the past,

487
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:27,557
but when I met you,

488
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:31,663
that person, the one that did
all those terrible things, he died.

489
00:39:31,935 --> 00:39:33,334
And I was reborn.

490
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:37,469
By the grace of your love, I was a...

491
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,874
A new man. A better man.

492
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:43,675
No.

493
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:48,710
That doesn't just erase the man
who killed six students in Alabama.

494
00:39:53,323 --> 00:39:55,450
I guess that's where you're right.

495
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:03,288
Because when you sent me here
to this place, with these people,

496
00:40:05,502 --> 00:40:08,369
it brought that old dirty bastard
right back home.

497
00:40:09,406 --> 00:40:11,306
In fact, there was a candle

498
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,104
in the window

499
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:19,144
just waiting for me
to walk up them front steps.

500
00:40:31,628 --> 00:40:33,118
You know, I'm gonna...

501
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:36,633
I'm gonna get out of here someday.

502
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:39,831
And when I do,

503
00:40:45,442 --> 00:40:49,845
don't think I won't remember
what your front steps look like, Susan.

504
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:22,042
It's almost over.

505
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:25,013
Burrows will be dead soon

506
00:41:25,115 --> 00:41:27,879
and then things will start
getting back to normal.

507
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:38,122
I know that you've been through a lot,

508
00:41:39,062 --> 00:41:42,327
but I promise you
the worst is now behind us.

509
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,142
My dear sister,

510
00:42:00,817 --> 00:42:03,149
you have no idea what I've been through.

511
00:42:05,322 --> 00:42:06,812
Good night, Terrence.
