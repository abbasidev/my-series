1
00:00:02,318 --> 00:00:03,820
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:04,821 --> 00:00:09,367
It's known as a one-way
street. What goes in never comes out.

3
00:00:09,617 --> 00:00:11,786
Since the riots,
they left us here to rot.

4
00:00:11,953 --> 00:00:15,623
They figured we would just destroy
ourselves. But instead, we've thrived.

5
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:18,376
How about we work together?
Help each other out.

6
00:00:18,543 --> 00:00:19,627
You're on your own.

7
00:00:19,794 --> 00:00:22,505
Get me out of this.
You wanna know where she is?

8
00:00:22,672 --> 00:00:23,798
Get me out of this.

9
00:00:23,965 --> 00:00:26,509
Maricruz. Maricruz.

10
00:00:26,717 --> 00:00:30,596
We can assist you, should you
ever decide to, say, break out of here.

11
00:00:30,763 --> 00:00:34,142
- This conversation's over.
- We're trying to do this the easy way.

12
00:00:35,726 --> 00:00:37,186
Think you can do me a favor?

13
00:00:46,654 --> 00:00:50,575
We have a lot to discuss,
Lincoln. Specifically, your brother.

14
00:00:50,741 --> 00:00:52,952
How are we coming with the transfer?

15
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:55,413
- You gotta stay.
- What are you talking about?

16
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:59,375
Dad, I'm so sorry.
They got me and Sara.

17
00:00:59,542 --> 00:01:03,880
You got a week to find this Whistler guy.
Otherwise, they-- They both die.

18
00:01:17,518 --> 00:01:18,769
Bring that up here.

19
00:01:21,647 --> 00:01:23,816
Yeah, get one for me
if you can.

20
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:27,403
- Where you from up there, bro?
- Chicago.

21
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:31,115
Michael Jordan.

22
00:01:31,908 --> 00:01:33,242
You meet him?

23
00:01:33,951 --> 00:01:35,036
It's a big city.

24
00:01:36,787 --> 00:01:38,372
Oh, yeah. It's a big city.

25
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:43,085
- Thanks for saving me a spot.
- Hey.

26
00:01:43,586 --> 00:01:44,754
Forget it.

27
00:01:50,217 --> 00:01:52,261
You ever have sex
with a blond cheerleader?

28
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:56,307
- Yeah, sure.
- You're the man, bro.

29
00:01:56,474 --> 00:02:00,811
- How long's the water been out?
- Since riots last year.

30
00:02:00,978 --> 00:02:02,480
Government blame us.

31
00:02:02,647 --> 00:02:07,318
They say,
"Screw you. You break it. No water."

32
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:12,948
Gracias.

33
00:02:18,287 --> 00:02:21,415
Real quick, there's an inmate here
named James Whistler.

34
00:02:21,582 --> 00:02:24,919
- I'm looking for him.
- Welcome to the club.

35
00:02:25,086 --> 00:02:27,880
- Everybody looking for him.
- Why's that?

36
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:32,134
He killed the mayor of Panama City's son
in a bar fight.

37
00:02:33,302 --> 00:02:34,428
The mayor not happy.

38
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:39,392
So where is he now?

39
00:02:40,684 --> 00:02:44,313
Disappeared.
Some say he might even escape.

40
00:02:45,606 --> 00:02:48,692
Hey. Hey.

41
00:02:49,193 --> 00:02:51,445
"I don't have no money.
I don't have no money."

42
00:02:51,612 --> 00:02:53,989
That's all I hear from you,
you know that?

43
00:02:54,156 --> 00:02:56,867
But then I see you with this.
Life must be good, eh?

44
00:02:57,034 --> 00:03:01,205
- Man, look, I'm-- I'm hungry, okay?
- You worry about me being hungry.

45
00:03:01,372 --> 00:03:02,915
Hey, hey, hey, come on.

46
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:05,793
- Come on.
- But you eat all the time.

47
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,712
Okay? I can see you up there.

48
00:03:11,841 --> 00:03:15,219
- Fight, fight, fight.
- Hey, hey, hey.

49
00:03:17,388 --> 00:03:18,931
Hey, get off.

50
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,441
Ah!

51
00:03:34,196 --> 00:03:36,949
- There's gonna be more water.
- When?

52
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,581
I said, there will be more water.

53
00:03:55,551 --> 00:03:56,969
Later, bro.

54
00:03:58,846 --> 00:04:01,682
Go. Go.

55
00:04:34,256 --> 00:04:35,549
Spare a little?

56
00:04:35,716 --> 00:04:37,927
- I need some information.
- Absolutely.

57
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:42,514
You slipped this note
in my pocket yesterday. Why?

58
00:04:42,681 --> 00:04:45,976
My memory's a little foggy
on account of this thirst.

59
00:04:49,271 --> 00:04:50,898
It's starting to come back to me.

60
00:04:51,065 --> 00:04:53,317
- A little more agua there.
- The note.

61
00:04:54,485 --> 00:04:55,611
Guy gave me rat meat...

62
00:04:55,778 --> 00:04:59,615
...for putting that in your pocket and
the pocket of the guy you were to fight.

63
00:04:59,782 --> 00:05:03,160
- Why?
- He's nuts, that's why.

64
00:05:03,327 --> 00:05:06,914
Anybody who can live down in those
sewers doesn't have all his faculties.

65
00:05:07,081 --> 00:05:08,332
Where in the sewers?

66
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,859
Whistler.

67
00:05:54,461 --> 00:05:56,338
Whistler.

68
00:06:05,681 --> 00:06:08,308
My name is Michael Scofield.

69
00:06:08,934 --> 00:06:11,478
I was sent to get you out of here.

70
00:06:15,107 --> 00:06:17,526
I'm gonna assume
they told you I was coming.

71
00:06:17,693 --> 00:06:20,070
Or that someone was coming.

72
00:06:21,947 --> 00:06:23,740
Whistler?

73
00:06:27,661 --> 00:06:32,291
Last chance.
I'm not coming down here again.

74
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:42,676
- You're here to get me out of Sona?
- Are you surprised?

75
00:06:44,136 --> 00:06:47,639
It's just that it's gonna be a bit difficult
getting me out of this hole.

76
00:06:47,806 --> 00:06:51,310
Seeing as if I go above ground
and another inmate spots me...

77
00:06:52,477 --> 00:06:53,604
...I'm a dead man.

78
00:07:30,515 --> 00:07:34,478
There's a slight misunderstanding
that I have with the mayor of--

79
00:07:34,645 --> 00:07:36,813
You know what?
It's none of my business.

80
00:07:37,522 --> 00:07:39,900
I'll come back and get you
when the time is right.

81
00:07:40,067 --> 00:07:42,569
- I may not make it that long.
- That's your problem.

82
00:07:42,736 --> 00:07:44,613
I've got problems of my own.

83
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:48,241
So you work for these people?
The ones that want me out of Sona.

84
00:07:48,408 --> 00:07:49,910
Look, just stay put.

85
00:07:50,077 --> 00:07:53,413
As long as no one knows you're here,
you should be safe. I'll be back.

86
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:57,042
Why do they want me out of here
so badly? Can you at least tell me that?

87
00:07:57,209 --> 00:08:00,545
Is this where you pretend
you're innocent, just a pawn in all this?

88
00:08:00,712 --> 00:08:03,548
If they told you anything about me
before you came here...

89
00:08:03,715 --> 00:08:05,926
...you'd know that to be true.

90
00:08:06,093 --> 00:08:08,345
I just wanna know
what they want with me.

91
00:08:08,762 --> 00:08:10,639
Stay put.

92
00:08:19,856 --> 00:08:23,819
- Sorry about the wait.
- It's quite all right.

93
00:08:25,195 --> 00:08:27,989
In an effort to save some time,
I gonna have to insist...

94
00:08:28,156 --> 00:08:32,077
...that we skip right past all the threats
I know you're prepared to lay out.

95
00:08:32,244 --> 00:08:35,831
Should anything happen to Sara or L.J.,
you will scour the Earth...

96
00:08:35,997 --> 00:08:39,793
...and hunt me down and rip my heart
from my chest and blah, blah, blah.

97
00:08:40,377 --> 00:08:43,880
I absolutely know how you feel,
as would I.

98
00:08:44,047 --> 00:08:49,094
Okay? So that's done. On to business.

99
00:08:50,262 --> 00:08:52,514
Did your brother get the message?

100
00:08:53,056 --> 00:08:55,517
Good.
You and I will meet here every day.

101
00:08:55,684 --> 00:08:58,562
I'll want a full report
of the prior day's progress.

102
00:08:58,729 --> 00:09:01,857
When I call your cell phone, answer.

103
00:09:02,023 --> 00:09:05,152
Don't ask me stupid questions.
Don't waste my time.

104
00:09:05,318 --> 00:09:07,988
Get a plan together. Execute it.

105
00:09:08,155 --> 00:09:11,867
L.J. and Sara will be traded for Whistler.
Are we clear?

106
00:09:12,868 --> 00:09:16,121
I want a picture of my son and Sara
to prove they're alive.

107
00:09:16,288 --> 00:09:19,249
- Fine, I can do that. Next.
- Why us?

108
00:09:19,749 --> 00:09:23,670
I'll answer that question so we can put it
to bed and you can focus on your work.

109
00:09:24,004 --> 00:09:27,507
There's a political spotlight on Whistler
due to the nature of his crime.

110
00:09:27,674 --> 00:09:30,719
Raids, bribes, what have you
are not an option.

111
00:09:30,886 --> 00:09:33,430
We have to go in through the back door,
so to speak.

112
00:09:34,306 --> 00:09:35,765
This can't be done in a week.

113
00:09:35,932 --> 00:09:38,935
You have a week. That's it.
Are we clear?

114
00:09:40,353 --> 00:09:41,688
What's your name?

115
00:09:43,773 --> 00:09:44,858
Susan B. Anthony.

116
00:09:45,025 --> 00:09:47,694
I'm assuming you weren't born
by immaculate conception.

117
00:09:47,861 --> 00:09:48,904
You're right, Lincoln.

118
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:54,534
Family trees being what they are,
moms, dads, brothers, sisters...

119
00:09:54,701 --> 00:09:57,954
Anything happens to my son or Sara...

120
00:09:58,121 --> 00:10:00,499
...I'm not coming after you, Susan.

121
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,710
Get to work.

122
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,217
His man knocks over the water...

123
00:10:52,384 --> 00:10:56,221
...and did you see
how Lechero just walked away?

124
00:10:56,388 --> 00:10:59,099
He doesn't care about us.
He doesn't give a damn.

125
00:10:59,266 --> 00:11:01,226
Living like a king up there.

126
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:04,938
Come out. What, are you afraid?

127
00:11:07,607 --> 00:11:10,986
Come out. Lechero, come out.

128
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,407
In there. Let's go.

129
00:11:18,952 --> 00:11:20,495
Por favor.

130
00:11:21,162 --> 00:11:22,580
Por favor.

131
00:11:31,548 --> 00:11:34,384
Why are you so interested
about that guy down there?

132
00:11:34,551 --> 00:11:35,593
No reason.

133
00:11:36,177 --> 00:11:38,138
Then why are you whispering,
college boy?

134
00:11:39,389 --> 00:11:42,434
- Why don't you lower your voice?
- What's in it for me?

135
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,187
I'm sorry, do you have any other friends
in here besides me? I'm it.

136
00:11:46,354 --> 00:11:50,442
Friends don't let friends go hungry
and thirsty and damn near half-naked.

137
00:11:50,608 --> 00:11:52,944
- I said, all right. I'll take care of it.
- When?

138
00:11:54,821 --> 00:11:56,072
When I can.

139
00:11:58,324 --> 00:12:01,453
What's the big deal? Why is he hiding?

140
00:12:04,748 --> 00:12:07,083
Who's he hiding from?

141
00:12:09,085 --> 00:12:11,880
Mayor get message to Lechero.

142
00:12:12,046 --> 00:12:15,008
He say if Whistler guy gets killed
here in Sona...

143
00:12:15,175 --> 00:12:17,719
...whoever kills him gets to go
to court.

144
00:12:17,886 --> 00:12:20,930
Gets to see a judge.
Judge friendly with the mayor.

145
00:12:21,097 --> 00:12:22,766
Kill him, and...

146
00:12:22,932 --> 00:12:24,976
And you get to get out of here
and be free?

147
00:12:25,602 --> 00:12:27,687
That's what Lechero said.

148
00:12:28,605 --> 00:12:31,357
This will stay between me and you.

149
00:12:32,609 --> 00:12:35,987
If your friend wanted you to know,
why didn't he tell you?

150
00:12:36,154 --> 00:12:38,364
Because--
Because you and I are friends now.

151
00:12:38,531 --> 00:12:40,492
Unless you wanna be enemies.

152
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,581
- Friends.
- Good. Me too.

153
00:12:57,133 --> 00:12:59,344
Sucre.

154
00:13:02,013 --> 00:13:03,848
Sucre, get me out of here, please.

155
00:13:04,015 --> 00:13:05,558
- Where's Maricruz?
- Oh, yeah.

156
00:13:06,184 --> 00:13:10,480
Yeah, Maricruz, she's good, she's okay.
But I'm not telling you anything until--

157
00:13:10,647 --> 00:13:12,148
Tell me where she is right now.

158
00:13:13,483 --> 00:13:15,902
You shoot me,
you'll end up inside this hellhole.

159
00:13:16,653 --> 00:13:19,405
I'm telling you, I don't care anymore.

160
00:13:21,449 --> 00:13:24,786
I can only guess she's dead by now.
So you're dying with her.

161
00:13:24,953 --> 00:13:26,454
I never had her.

162
00:13:27,413 --> 00:13:30,333
At that house in Mexico,
I chased your aunt and Maricruz off.

163
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,836
I told them I'd lock them up
for accessory if they didn't hightail it.

164
00:13:34,003 --> 00:13:35,463
I swear to God.

165
00:13:36,714 --> 00:13:39,592
- And the crucifix?
- I ripped it off Maricruz before she ran.

166
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:41,427
There was no phone in that dump...

167
00:13:41,594 --> 00:13:44,847
...so I knew you wouldn't be able to call
from the road to...

168
00:13:45,014 --> 00:13:47,934
To make sure I wasn't lying.

169
00:13:48,101 --> 00:13:50,186
- I conned you.
- So...

170
00:13:51,771 --> 00:13:53,398
So Maricruz is...

171
00:13:53,564 --> 00:13:56,693
She's picking grapes. I have no idea.

172
00:13:56,859 --> 00:14:00,280
So just lower the barrel.
Put the gun down.

173
00:14:06,661 --> 00:14:09,872
Now, I came clean with you
and helped you out, right, buddy?

174
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:12,125
So you gotta return the favor.

175
00:14:12,667 --> 00:14:16,296
Call my mom in Joliet. Edna Bellick.

176
00:14:16,462 --> 00:14:17,964
Think she's listed. Sucre.

177
00:14:18,131 --> 00:14:21,676
I never laid a hand on Maricruz.
I would never do that.

178
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,512
Sucre, help me, please.

179
00:14:25,346 --> 00:14:29,684
Sucre, help me. Help me.

180
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,085
- Hey.
- Hey.

181
00:15:38,753 --> 00:15:41,422
- You find Whistler?
- Yeah.

182
00:15:41,589 --> 00:15:43,633
What's his story?

183
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,804
I don't know.
And maybe it's better that way, huh?

184
00:15:48,721 --> 00:15:50,681
I just gotta get him out of here, right?

185
00:15:50,848 --> 00:15:52,600
Come on, man.
We gotta keep moving.

186
00:15:52,767 --> 00:15:55,019
We gotta keep moving.
What's the next play?

187
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,981
Whistler got a note out
on a dead body yesterday.

188
00:16:00,775 --> 00:16:03,903
I don't know what it means
or who it's for.

189
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:06,822
But we need all the leverage
we can get.

190
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:09,325
And I need some money.

191
00:16:13,287 --> 00:16:15,164
Step back. Step back.

192
00:16:19,627 --> 00:16:23,756
No one's ever broken out of this place
before, let alone with a week to plan it.

193
00:16:26,968 --> 00:16:28,928
So you tell these people...

194
00:16:29,095 --> 00:16:33,641
...whoever it is that took Sara
and my nephew...

195
00:16:35,893 --> 00:16:40,064
You tell them I get it,
and I'm gonna do everything I can.

196
00:16:40,231 --> 00:16:44,527
I'm gonna break this guy out of here,
or I'm gonna die trying.

197
00:16:44,694 --> 00:16:46,529
And if it's the latter...

198
00:16:46,696 --> 00:16:49,657
...then that should count
for something, right?

199
00:16:49,824 --> 00:16:52,952
That's gotta count for something.
You tell them that.

200
00:16:53,119 --> 00:16:56,038
- I will.
- Tell them.

201
00:16:56,205 --> 00:16:58,165
I'd trade places with you in a second.

202
00:17:01,294 --> 00:17:02,503
I know.

203
00:17:08,634 --> 00:17:09,885
Whistler?

204
00:17:30,823 --> 00:17:32,450
You're not safe here.

205
00:17:35,661 --> 00:17:37,955
I can take you someplace that is.

206
00:17:45,129 --> 00:17:49,133
If you're here to help me,
then just leave me alone.

207
00:17:53,637 --> 00:17:55,306
Please.

208
00:18:14,075 --> 00:18:15,868
Sucre?

209
00:18:16,494 --> 00:18:18,454
Lincoln, man.
What are you doing here?

210
00:18:19,121 --> 00:18:21,749
- What are you doing here?
- Michael's locked up.

211
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:24,543
- For what?
- I don't know. I'm sorting it through.

212
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:28,297
I could use your help.
We're in a-- We're in a bad spot.

213
00:18:28,464 --> 00:18:31,175
I feel for you, man,
but I'm done with bad spots, Linc.

214
00:18:31,342 --> 00:18:33,969
I'm gonna go see Maricruz.
I talked to my cousin Petey.

215
00:18:34,136 --> 00:18:35,805
He told me she's back in Chicago.

216
00:18:35,971 --> 00:18:38,432
Hey, you're still wanted in Chicago,
remember?

217
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:40,518
I'll figure something out.

218
00:18:43,813 --> 00:18:46,607
If you change your mind,
I'm staying at the Plaza del Sol.

219
00:18:46,774 --> 00:18:49,944
I won't. I'm-- I'm out of here, bro.
I'm gonna go see my girl.

220
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:52,613
The innocent people in your life,
keep them innocent.

221
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:56,075
If that means walking away from them,
that's what you gotta do.

222
00:18:59,161 --> 00:19:00,412
Good luck, Linc.

223
00:19:24,144 --> 00:19:25,563
Hey, get him.

224
00:19:26,313 --> 00:19:29,817
Have we had our laughs with him yet?
He's useless, man.

225
00:19:29,984 --> 00:19:33,487
You wanna get rid of him?
Then you cut the mango.

226
00:19:33,988 --> 00:19:36,323
You caused me a big,
big problem out there today.

227
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:39,577
You understand that?
Now there's no more water.

228
00:19:39,743 --> 00:19:43,038
- They'll live.
- Oh, yeah? They'll live?

229
00:19:43,831 --> 00:19:46,584
You go out and tell them that, then.

230
00:19:50,671 --> 00:19:52,339
Theodore.

231
00:19:57,428 --> 00:19:59,430
There's water here.

232
00:19:59,597 --> 00:20:02,725
- Give each man a little, eh?
- At once.

233
00:20:07,563 --> 00:20:09,940
Hey, Lechero.

234
00:20:11,734 --> 00:20:14,903
Don't worry about us. We're fine.

235
00:20:15,613 --> 00:20:18,032
He may have ruled the streets
out there...

236
00:20:18,198 --> 00:20:21,285
...but in here, he's just like us.

237
00:20:21,452 --> 00:20:25,456
Just like us.
Come out. What, are you afraid?

238
00:20:25,622 --> 00:20:27,374
- Come and lean on it.
- Come on, man.

239
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:28,709
Come on.

240
00:20:30,669 --> 00:20:33,714
The American in his underwear,
you seen him?

241
00:20:44,516 --> 00:20:46,518
T-Bag.

242
00:20:46,685 --> 00:20:49,688
You're gonna be drinking your urine
before you get any of this.

243
00:20:49,855 --> 00:20:52,358
I just need to speak to Señor Lechero.
Please.

244
00:20:52,524 --> 00:20:56,403
- Do yourself a favor. Scamper.
- But I got something.

245
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:59,698
Oh, yeah.
You got yourself the untouchable status.

246
00:20:59,865 --> 00:21:02,785
Get myself killed
just talking to your mangy ass.

247
00:21:06,622 --> 00:21:07,873
But I got information.

248
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,460
Good information.

249
00:21:24,973 --> 00:21:28,227
- Are you out of your mind?
- He's got info.

250
00:21:28,393 --> 00:21:30,646
- Pick a kneecap, huh?
- I got information.

251
00:21:30,813 --> 00:21:33,190
- I just want food and clothes.
- Patrón, please.

252
00:21:33,357 --> 00:21:35,025
Hold on there.

253
00:21:37,361 --> 00:21:41,198
This better be informative,
or it's your kneecap next.

254
00:21:43,575 --> 00:21:46,662
This morning,
before that whole water thing...

255
00:21:46,954 --> 00:21:50,249
...I heard you and the lads
talking about that Whistler character...

256
00:21:50,415 --> 00:21:51,834
...how no one's found him.

257
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,878
- Well...
- Please, I just want food and clothing.

258
00:21:55,045 --> 00:21:58,340
- Just tell him, idiot.
- A guy is hiding in the sewers.

259
00:21:58,507 --> 00:22:01,593
I figure he's hiding from you
because you run this place.

260
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,221
Figured you'd wanna know
everything that goes on--

261
00:22:04,388 --> 00:22:07,516
Fine, shut up.
It just might be Whistler.

262
00:22:07,683 --> 00:22:09,268
See, patrón, see?

263
00:22:16,483 --> 00:22:21,113
- Is he Australian?
- Yeah, yeah.

264
00:22:33,584 --> 00:22:37,588
Courtesy of the Lechero's munificence.

265
00:22:38,797 --> 00:22:41,216
Go easy, back up. You can't have--

266
00:22:43,135 --> 00:22:45,304
Hey, how long have you been in Sona?

267
00:22:46,638 --> 00:22:47,806
Two years.

268
00:22:48,515 --> 00:22:50,726
- How old are you?
- Seventeen.

269
00:22:52,352 --> 00:22:55,314
As far as you know,
no one's ever broken out of this place...

270
00:22:56,315 --> 00:22:58,025
...except maybe this Whistler guy?

271
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:02,029
You Americans ask a lot of questions.

272
00:23:16,376 --> 00:23:18,962
- Oh, no.
- What's wrong?

273
00:23:19,129 --> 00:23:21,965
- Come on.
- Please, I have a family.

274
00:23:22,466 --> 00:23:25,302
So do I. Come on.

275
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:30,349
Just stop. Stop, okay?

276
00:23:30,515 --> 00:23:32,601
Just...

277
00:23:44,905 --> 00:23:46,656
He's coming with me.

278
00:24:06,385 --> 00:24:09,179
Just back up, Michael. Just...

279
00:24:12,766 --> 00:24:16,478
You don't actually think killing somebody
is gonna help you get out of here?

280
00:24:16,645 --> 00:24:18,313
That does seem strange, doesn't it?

281
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,650
But this is a really strange place,
one that I want to get out of.

282
00:24:21,817 --> 00:24:26,029
Then I'll help you.
I'll testify for you, whatever it takes.

283
00:24:26,196 --> 00:24:28,323
Wow, look at that halo.

284
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:30,826
It just appeared above your head.
That's amazing.

285
00:24:30,992 --> 00:24:34,246
- I don't have a choice, Alex.
- What did you tell me yesterday?

286
00:24:34,913 --> 00:24:38,625
"You're on your own, Alex."
Back up. Back up.

287
00:24:41,628 --> 00:24:44,381
You... You don't want this.

288
00:24:45,215 --> 00:24:46,925
Let me help you, Alex.

289
00:24:54,182 --> 00:24:55,892
Back up.

290
00:25:02,065 --> 00:25:03,817
Hey. Your Majesty.

291
00:25:05,402 --> 00:25:07,863
- Where are you hiding?
- You gotta shut him up.

292
00:25:08,029 --> 00:25:09,406
Where are you hiding?

293
00:25:09,573 --> 00:25:12,909
- I need this bolsón to call me back.
- I need to talk to you.

294
00:25:13,076 --> 00:25:15,245
Don't ever walk in here
without being called.

295
00:25:15,412 --> 00:25:17,998
- Sorry. It's worth a breach in etiquette.
- Is it, now?

296
00:25:18,707 --> 00:25:22,669
I thought you could use my help.
There are ways I can be of assistance.

297
00:25:23,587 --> 00:25:26,047
Just take the bounty off Whistler.

298
00:25:27,465 --> 00:25:29,551
Whistler don't mean
nothing to me, man.

299
00:25:29,718 --> 00:25:33,096
I have five life sentences.
I ain't coming out of Sona no time soon.

300
00:25:33,263 --> 00:25:36,057
And why should I deprive other men
of a chance at freedom?

301
00:25:36,224 --> 00:25:39,060
- I need you to trust me.
- Oh.

302
00:25:39,227 --> 00:25:40,520
Trust you?

303
00:25:42,939 --> 00:25:45,025
I don't know you good enough,
brother.

304
00:25:48,695 --> 00:25:51,656
- Theodore.
- Sí, patrón.

305
00:25:59,331 --> 00:26:00,498
Can I trust this bobo?

306
00:26:03,627 --> 00:26:05,170
He's a snake.

307
00:26:06,838 --> 00:26:10,050
He stabbed me in the back
every chance he got.

308
00:26:11,259 --> 00:26:14,763
A snake who'd stab a man
in the back.

309
00:26:17,098 --> 00:26:19,601
I never hear of such a creature before.

310
00:26:22,312 --> 00:26:23,938
We gotta stop this.

311
00:26:25,148 --> 00:26:28,318
- Just give me two more minutes.
- Leave. Now.

312
00:26:28,485 --> 00:26:30,362
Leave.

313
00:26:31,154 --> 00:26:32,322
Crumbs.

314
00:26:32,489 --> 00:26:35,367
That's what you're giving us,
your crumbs.

315
00:26:36,951 --> 00:26:41,331
Hey, Lechero, how's your television?
How's your whore?

316
00:26:42,123 --> 00:26:43,750
Come out. What are you scared of?

317
00:26:43,917 --> 00:26:47,170
Hey. I'm gonna need some--
Some moonshine.

318
00:26:47,337 --> 00:26:48,630
- Moonshine?
- Some alcohol.

319
00:26:48,797 --> 00:26:50,090
- Booze.
- Booze, yeah.

320
00:26:50,256 --> 00:26:53,176
Well, I need it now.
A liter, a gallon, whatever you can get.

321
00:26:53,343 --> 00:26:56,429
- It's not the time for a party, bro.
- Bring it to me in my cell.

322
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:09,979
Come on, Whistler.

323
00:29:14,275 --> 00:29:16,611
Whistler, stop, stop. What are you--?

324
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:24,994
Just come up top with me.

325
00:29:26,955 --> 00:29:29,082
You got a better chance
coming up with me.

326
00:29:29,248 --> 00:29:31,334
At least you can plead your case
to Lechero.

327
00:29:31,501 --> 00:29:33,503
- Just get--
- Go to hell.

328
00:29:34,754 --> 00:29:36,547
Just--
- Go away.

329
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:46,808
- Not his best batch, he said.
- That's fine.

330
00:29:46,974 --> 00:29:48,768
I'm gonna need some plastic bags.

331
00:29:49,894 --> 00:29:54,440
- You didn't get it for to party, did you?
- Plastic bags. As many as you can get.

332
00:29:54,607 --> 00:29:57,485
I'll make it worth your while,
I promise.

333
00:30:24,971 --> 00:30:27,181
- Gracias.
- Gracias.

334
00:30:41,028 --> 00:30:44,073
- Excuse me. You speak English?
- Yeah.

335
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,786
We've met.
I mean, I saw you yesterday at Sona.

336
00:30:48,953 --> 00:30:50,079
Yeah.

337
00:30:50,246 --> 00:30:53,040
You know, you can lose
the whole grieving-widow thing.

338
00:30:53,207 --> 00:30:55,042
You're Whistler's girl, right?

339
00:30:55,209 --> 00:30:58,004
- I'm sorry, I have to be somewhere.
- I gotta do something.

340
00:30:58,171 --> 00:30:59,547
Do what?

341
00:30:59,714 --> 00:31:02,216
Give me that back
or I'll call the police.

342
00:31:02,383 --> 00:31:04,135
You're not gonna call the police.

343
00:31:08,222 --> 00:31:09,891
Why does he want this?

344
00:31:12,935 --> 00:31:15,563
- I don't know. He's just a fisherman.
- Fisherman?

345
00:31:16,856 --> 00:31:18,191
Tell your fisherman friend--

346
00:31:18,357 --> 00:31:21,944
Tell your fisherman friend
Scofield's brother has this.

347
00:31:24,363 --> 00:31:26,449
Why won't you people
just leave him alone?

348
00:31:28,409 --> 00:31:33,122
You think we wanna be forced into this?
You think we wanna be here, lady?

349
00:31:33,915 --> 00:31:35,082
Forced into what?

350
00:31:36,834 --> 00:31:38,961
What are you talking about?

351
00:31:50,223 --> 00:31:53,392
All right, hold this. Hold it.

352
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:55,978
Watch the hallway for me.

353
00:31:58,064 --> 00:32:00,274
I'm friends with everybody here, bro.

354
00:32:01,067 --> 00:32:02,568
That's how I keep alive.

355
00:32:03,736 --> 00:32:08,074
- You and I are friends, right?
- Yeah, but it looks like you got enemies.

356
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:15,873
What I did for you,
getting you those things...

357
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,208
No one will ever know.

358
00:32:20,795 --> 00:32:23,547
Lechero! Lechero! Lechero!

359
00:32:26,133 --> 00:32:29,470
Lechero! Lechero! Lechero!

360
00:32:34,266 --> 00:32:37,478
Stand up, stand up, stand up.

361
00:32:38,062 --> 00:32:39,480
Come on.

362
00:32:39,647 --> 00:32:42,400
Back up. Back up.

363
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:46,028
You can have him.

364
00:32:46,195 --> 00:32:48,489
But two of you will die
in the process.

365
00:32:48,656 --> 00:32:52,618
You first? You first.
I'll wrap this right around your head.

366
00:32:52,785 --> 00:32:54,453
Move. Move.

367
00:33:16,434 --> 00:33:21,355
Lechero! Lechero! Lechero!

368
00:33:21,522 --> 00:33:24,650
Enough. Let me go down there.

369
00:33:24,817 --> 00:33:28,320
Let me cut just one throat. Just one.

370
00:33:28,487 --> 00:33:30,114
They'll quiet down, man.

371
00:33:30,281 --> 00:33:33,409
And then regroup later
with a real reason to come after you.

372
00:33:33,576 --> 00:33:35,953
Shut your mouth.

373
00:33:37,121 --> 00:33:38,539
He's right, Sammy.

374
00:33:40,207 --> 00:33:42,376
So, what we gonna do, boss?

375
00:33:42,877 --> 00:33:46,088
Are we just gonna sit up here,
hope they run out of rocks?

376
00:33:51,969 --> 00:33:55,014
- Look, we have a problem.
- What is it?

377
00:33:57,016 --> 00:34:00,853
- Ran out of water.
- So you mean you've got a problem.

378
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:04,565
Look, there was an accident.
The tank tip over.

379
00:34:04,732 --> 00:34:06,525
My men need water.

380
00:34:07,151 --> 00:34:09,862
I'll see if I can get the water truck
day after tomorrow.

381
00:34:10,029 --> 00:34:11,780
I need water now.

382
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:15,242
Guess it's too bad there's no guards
in there anymore with you.

383
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:19,872
You could take hostages,
have a riot, make demands.

384
00:34:20,331 --> 00:34:21,916
Day after tomorrow.

385
00:34:23,667 --> 00:34:27,046
You call me and you raise your voice
at me like that again...

386
00:34:27,213 --> 00:34:30,049
...you're not going to see water
for two weeks.

387
00:35:53,173 --> 00:35:54,466
They got Whistler.

388
00:36:13,569 --> 00:36:14,611
Enough.

389
00:36:16,071 --> 00:36:17,531
Enough.

390
00:36:20,534 --> 00:36:23,954
- I'll decide this.
- You decide nothing.

391
00:36:29,877 --> 00:36:32,504
You can't deliver, Lechero.
You are done here.

392
00:36:41,388 --> 00:36:42,848
What's that? What's happening?

393
00:36:43,015 --> 00:36:44,808
I don't know.

394
00:37:16,798 --> 00:37:18,008
Now what?

395
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,220
What do we do?

396
00:37:28,268 --> 00:37:30,896
- You've been outbid.
- Wait, what are you talking about?

397
00:37:32,231 --> 00:37:35,025
What are you talking about?
What are you talking...?

398
00:37:38,904 --> 00:37:42,032
Now, that's very useful.

399
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:45,035
Very useful.

400
00:37:49,289 --> 00:37:51,542
And Whistler's clear?

401
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:57,673
Yeah. Clear as a blue sky, brother.

402
00:38:27,995 --> 00:38:30,831
- Hello?
- Baby, it's me.

403
00:38:30,998 --> 00:38:32,374
Oh, my God.

404
00:38:33,083 --> 00:38:36,545
Honey, I've been so scared.
I've been praying every day.

405
00:38:36,712 --> 00:38:40,007
I did too, babe.
I just thank God you're okay.

406
00:38:41,466 --> 00:38:45,721
Petey called me after he'd talked to you.
He said you might be coming back here.

407
00:38:45,887 --> 00:38:50,392
- That's what I told him, yeah.
- You have to be so careful.

408
00:38:51,643 --> 00:38:54,980
Baby, I've been thinking...

409
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,608
...and the only thing that I--

410
00:38:58,775 --> 00:39:03,113
That I care about right now
is that you and the baby are okay.

411
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,824
That's all that matters to me.

412
00:39:07,325 --> 00:39:08,994
I'm not coming back.

413
00:39:09,828 --> 00:39:12,539
It's not because I don't love you,
because you know I do.

414
00:39:12,706 --> 00:39:16,251
I love you more--
I love you more than anything.

415
00:39:16,418 --> 00:39:20,422
But all--
All I'd do is bring you down.

416
00:39:20,589 --> 00:39:22,090
I'm no good for you.

417
00:39:22,257 --> 00:39:25,635
- That's not true. That's not true.
- It is, it is, it is.

418
00:39:25,802 --> 00:39:31,266
And sometimes the only way
to protect the people that you love is--

419
00:39:31,433 --> 00:39:33,477
Is by staying away from them.

420
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,689
One day, when I get my life together...

421
00:39:37,856 --> 00:39:40,317
...however long that takes,
I'll find you.

422
00:39:41,109 --> 00:39:44,863
I'll find you, and I'll--
And I'll make you and our baby proud.

423
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,202
I wish we could go back.

424
00:39:51,745 --> 00:39:54,998
I would give anything to go back.

425
00:39:58,835 --> 00:40:03,298
I wish that too. I wish that too, baby.

426
00:40:05,091 --> 00:40:07,636
I love you so much, baby.

427
00:40:09,638 --> 00:40:12,390
I love you too, baby.

428
00:40:17,354 --> 00:40:18,939
Goodbye.

429
00:40:20,732 --> 00:40:22,609
Bye.

430
00:40:38,583 --> 00:40:41,586
You know, they told me
that your brother got all the brains...

431
00:40:41,753 --> 00:40:44,798
...but I didn't realize
you were this stupid.

432
00:40:44,965 --> 00:40:46,132
What do you want, Susan?

433
00:40:46,299 --> 00:40:48,552
No sooner do I tell you
to stick to the plan...

434
00:40:48,718 --> 00:40:51,012
...than you go
and hassle Whistler's girlfriend.

435
00:40:51,179 --> 00:40:54,933
You need to quit playing
Sherlock Holmes and leave her alone.

436
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:57,727
- Why?
- Because I said so.

437
00:40:57,894 --> 00:40:59,854
- How about that?
- All right.

438
00:41:00,647 --> 00:41:02,983
How about you beat it
so I can get to work?

439
00:41:03,149 --> 00:41:06,278
I will, as soon as you give me
what you took from her.

440
00:41:06,444 --> 00:41:07,487
I took nothing.

441
00:41:07,654 --> 00:41:11,032
I got a gallon of bleach, a tarp
and a hacksaw in my car.

442
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:14,744
One hour, tops,
you're off the face of the Earth.

443
00:41:18,665 --> 00:41:22,877
- It's just a bird guide.
- I am not gonna ask you again.

444
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,591
Toss it.

445
00:41:31,928 --> 00:41:36,891
Tomorrow, bar, progress report.
I will be waiting.

446
00:42:21,394 --> 00:42:23,521
So it's water you want?

447
00:42:27,567 --> 00:42:28,818
Here's your water.

448
00:42:46,336 --> 00:42:48,088
Thank you.

449
00:42:53,635 --> 00:42:55,970
So how are we getting out of here?

450
00:42:58,848 --> 00:43:00,892
I have no idea.
