1
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,536
You gotta do something.
My brother is innocent.

2
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:20,162
Look, there's nothing I can do.

3
00:01:20,329 --> 00:01:23,791
- Back at the crime scene, that'll prove--
- I'm a night clerk, okay?

4
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:26,585
You want someone who
can do something, the consul.

5
00:01:26,752 --> 00:01:28,754
He gets in, in the morning.

6
00:01:29,296 --> 00:01:30,923
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,842
That ain't gonna cut it.

8
00:01:34,301 --> 00:01:37,263
Your brother,
where do they have him incarcerated?

9
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,931
Sona.

10
00:01:40,224 --> 00:01:41,267
What?

11
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:47,857
The worst of the worst are there.
Men no other prison will take.

12
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,367
They rioted so badly a year ago,
the guards pulled out.

13
00:01:58,534 --> 00:02:00,327
Just left them to themselves.

14
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:04,206
A thousand thieves, rapists, murderers.

15
00:02:15,217 --> 00:02:17,720
The government just stays back,
keeps a perimeter.

16
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:31,192
To them, Sona's a one-way street.

17
00:02:31,525 --> 00:02:33,319
What goes in...

18
00:02:33,777 --> 00:02:35,571
...never comes out...

19
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,907
...unless it's dead.

20
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,794
Somebody didn't do
their due diligence...

21
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:36,131
...and we need him moved to a facility
that's a little more moderate, all right?

22
00:03:36,298 --> 00:03:37,633
Thank you.

23
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,345
All right, the good news is,
as of yesterday, you're a free man.

24
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:43,806
- You got nothing to worry about.
- Just my brother.

25
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,642
Right. Well, that's a heck of a story,
you two.

26
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,477
That made the news even down here.

27
00:03:48,644 --> 00:03:50,562
And I understand
you have a son as well?

28
00:03:50,729 --> 00:03:52,481
- Yeah. Uh-huh.
- L.J.? Lincoln Jr.?

29
00:03:52,648 --> 00:03:54,650
He must be ecstatic
about your exoneration.

30
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:57,736
- Still trying to reach him.
- Oh, well, hey, tell us where he is.

31
00:03:57,903 --> 00:04:01,156
- We'll send somebody--
- Let me handle it. Let's focus on Michael.

32
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:02,658
Okay. Well...

33
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:06,287
...good news is that what you're saying
is checking out at the crime scene.

34
00:04:06,662 --> 00:04:10,749
The victim did have a service revolver
with U.S. government numbers on it.

35
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:15,337
If a weapon was found, then that lends
real credence to self-defense as a motive.

36
00:04:15,504 --> 00:04:18,924
Great. They find anything else?

37
00:04:19,216 --> 00:04:20,843
- Like what?
- A bag.

38
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,846
- What was in it?
- A little money.

39
00:04:24,054 --> 00:04:25,848
- Sorry.
- Of course they didn't.

40
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:28,434
Yeah, well, whatever the case,
regarding Michael...

41
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,686
...I have managed
to make a little headway.

42
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:34,732
I arranged for a transfer for your brother
to another facility, effective tomorrow.

43
00:04:34,898 --> 00:04:37,526
- It's a lot safer, it's a lot cleaner.
- Great.

44
00:04:37,693 --> 00:04:41,030
And if this is stacking up
like I think it is...

45
00:04:41,196 --> 00:04:43,490
...I'd be pretty confident the charges
will be dropped.

46
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,492
He'd be free?

47
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,786
Well, he'd still face charges
in the U.S.

48
00:04:48,245 --> 00:04:51,040
- But out of there?
- Yes.

49
00:05:41,131 --> 00:05:42,883
Is there a damn mess hall here?

50
00:05:43,717 --> 00:05:45,260
Mess hall?

51
00:05:45,427 --> 00:05:50,307
Then some water, man?
I'm dying of thirst. Please. Please.

52
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,769
There's some water.

53
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:59,191
Bite me.

54
00:06:00,776 --> 00:06:02,778
- What'd you say?
- I didn't say nothing.

55
00:06:05,989 --> 00:06:07,574
Drink.

56
00:06:08,116 --> 00:06:10,035
Do you hear me? Drink.

57
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:32,683
Hey, get used to it, man.

58
00:06:32,849 --> 00:06:34,476
I haven't eaten for days.

59
00:06:35,852 --> 00:06:37,396
Come on.

60
00:07:34,286 --> 00:07:36,705
- To the left.
- Moving up.

61
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,126
- How are you doing?
- What do you want, Alex?

62
00:07:42,002 --> 00:07:46,173
Ah, you're so clever, like planting
the drugs on the boat. That's a big irony.

63
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:49,718
- Lawman in jail.
- You are exactly where you belong.

64
00:07:49,885 --> 00:07:52,054
That's where you're wrong.
You're gonna help me.

65
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,806
I will have a court date
and you will be there...

66
00:07:54,973 --> 00:07:59,394
...on the stand, and you will tell the truth,
that you planted this, you set this up.

67
00:07:59,561 --> 00:08:02,397
- And I'm gonna go home.
- That's funny.

68
00:08:02,564 --> 00:08:05,192
I could've sworn you set this up.

69
00:08:06,443 --> 00:08:08,612
I set this up? I'm in here.

70
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:11,156
What does the Company want with me?
Why Panama?

71
00:08:11,323 --> 00:08:13,742
What, you think I know
what they wanted?

72
00:08:15,035 --> 00:08:16,369
They had me.

73
00:08:16,536 --> 00:08:19,039
I did what they asked me to do...

74
00:08:19,206 --> 00:08:22,876
...arrest you in Panama, hand you over.
That's it. That's-- That's...

75
00:08:27,297 --> 00:08:31,384
That's old news, huh? This is the
first day of the rest of our lives.

76
00:08:31,551 --> 00:08:34,137
How about we work together?
Help each other out.

77
00:08:34,304 --> 00:08:36,598
Except every time I look at you...

78
00:08:36,765 --> 00:08:39,601
...all I can see is the man
who killed my father.

79
00:08:41,728 --> 00:08:42,771
You're on your own.

80
00:09:15,303 --> 00:09:18,515
Sign here to say that once inside,
you're on your own by the law.

81
00:09:18,682 --> 00:09:21,142
You're not protected by the military
in an assault.

82
00:09:21,309 --> 00:09:23,895
Any attempt to assist an inmate
trying to escape...

83
00:09:24,062 --> 00:09:26,189
...will be met with a lethal response.

84
00:09:26,356 --> 00:09:28,191
Wouldn't dream of it.

85
00:09:43,873 --> 00:09:46,668
- So.
- So.

86
00:09:48,169 --> 00:09:50,505
Feel like I'm on the wrong side.

87
00:09:50,672 --> 00:09:52,924
- You're on the right side.
- You're not.

88
00:09:53,675 --> 00:09:54,801
You gonna break me out?

89
00:09:55,302 --> 00:09:57,345
Too tiring. All that running.

90
00:09:57,512 --> 00:10:00,599
Yeah, well, maybe you should've
lost the cowboy boots.

91
00:10:01,182 --> 00:10:02,434
You scared?

92
00:10:06,313 --> 00:10:08,440
- I'm getting you out of here, man.
- Oh, Linc.

93
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:13,653
The consulate's arranged to transfer you
until the trial, which is about a month.

94
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,697
You got a good shot
at walking out free.

95
00:10:15,864 --> 00:10:18,700
- When's the transfer?
- Tomorrow.

96
00:10:18,867 --> 00:10:21,745
Just-- Just hold on, man,
one more day.

97
00:10:21,911 --> 00:10:24,873
You know, I keep waiting for you
to mention a certain someone.

98
00:10:28,043 --> 00:10:30,837
- I don't know where she is, man.
- Well, you gotta find her.

99
00:10:31,004 --> 00:10:32,505
I will.

100
00:10:33,631 --> 00:10:34,966
She's important to me, Linc.

101
00:10:37,385 --> 00:10:39,804
If anything happens to Sara...

102
00:10:42,849 --> 00:10:46,478
It's gonna be fine, man, I promise.

103
00:10:49,522 --> 00:10:51,274
See you tomorrow.

104
00:10:52,067 --> 00:10:53,526
All right?

105
00:11:15,882 --> 00:11:18,593
American, right? I love America.

106
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,263
NBA. Tracy McGrady shooting the ball
in the hoop from downtown.

107
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,557
Whatever you're selling,
I'm not buying.

108
00:11:24,724 --> 00:11:27,727
Selling? I just wanna talk basketball.

109
00:11:27,894 --> 00:11:28,937
Who's your team?

110
00:11:32,607 --> 00:11:34,692
Let's go, blanco. Orientation.

111
00:11:34,859 --> 00:11:37,529
- I'm not interested.
- That's not for you to decide.

112
00:11:56,548 --> 00:11:58,258
Bring them in.

113
00:12:15,608 --> 00:12:17,986
I hope they haven't been
treating you too poorly.

114
00:12:18,152 --> 00:12:19,821
I should hear of it if you have.

115
00:12:19,988 --> 00:12:23,491
I think, as you can tell, Sona
is unlike any other place in the world.

116
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,619
Since the riots last year,
they left us here to rot.

117
00:12:26,786 --> 00:12:30,665
They figured we would just destroy
ourselves, but instead we've thrived.

118
00:12:30,832 --> 00:12:34,460
With the canal, Panama is now
a breeding ground for international crime.

119
00:12:34,627 --> 00:12:37,463
Twenty-seven different nationalities
we have here...

120
00:12:37,755 --> 00:12:40,008
...but not one gang.

121
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,053
Not one racially motivated
incident, huh?

122
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,514
It's just me.

123
00:12:49,017 --> 00:12:52,145
Egalitarianism, I believe, is the word.

124
00:12:52,437 --> 00:12:54,606
Huh? Did I get that right?

125
00:12:55,231 --> 00:12:57,025
Right as rain.

126
00:12:57,442 --> 00:13:00,028
That's what practice does for you.

127
00:13:00,194 --> 00:13:04,490
Now, is there anything
you want to tell me?

128
00:13:05,116 --> 00:13:08,536
Any history that you bring to this place
I should know about?

129
00:13:17,378 --> 00:13:21,716
I don't think you're quite telling me
the truth, Mr. Scofield.

130
00:13:23,092 --> 00:13:24,969
We get the news, man.

131
00:13:25,136 --> 00:13:27,555
You were quite the superstar on CNN.

132
00:13:27,722 --> 00:13:31,559
Man breaks brother out
and flees to Panama.

133
00:13:33,561 --> 00:13:36,773
But you're not a superstar here.
You realize that, don't you?

134
00:13:36,939 --> 00:13:38,358
I'm not gonna make waves.

135
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,736
No, it wouldn't be within your power.

136
00:13:49,202 --> 00:13:52,955
I heard about the two of you
in the hall today.

137
00:13:53,414 --> 00:13:57,001
Now, if you would like to sort
your problems out, it's very simple here.

138
00:13:59,754 --> 00:14:02,924
A man has a beef with another,
he makes his problem known.

139
00:14:03,091 --> 00:14:04,425
Huh?

140
00:14:04,592 --> 00:14:09,597
And then we deal with it directly,
as men, out there.

141
00:14:10,723 --> 00:14:12,683
Won't be necessary.

142
00:14:23,653 --> 00:14:25,947
You always shake like that?

143
00:14:26,114 --> 00:14:27,323
Huh?

144
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:29,408
Or just when you're scared of someone?

145
00:14:58,354 --> 00:14:59,647
I think he gets the message.

146
00:15:04,485 --> 00:15:07,613
We could go, you and me, right here.

147
00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:13,494
You're a brave man, huh?

148
00:15:14,328 --> 00:15:16,205
A brave man.

149
00:15:19,417 --> 00:15:21,085
You're lucky I've been meditating.

150
00:15:21,252 --> 00:15:23,838
Before, I couldn't take my finger
off the trigger. Now--

151
00:15:24,005 --> 00:15:26,507
Now I have mind control.

152
00:15:26,883 --> 00:15:29,594
Complete control...

153
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:34,098
...mind, body and soul.

154
00:15:37,268 --> 00:15:38,603
Get out!

155
00:15:39,896 --> 00:15:41,689
Get out!

156
00:15:50,031 --> 00:15:51,490
Complete waste of our time.

157
00:15:51,657 --> 00:15:55,286
Who would've thought,
a famous person in Sona.

158
00:15:55,453 --> 00:15:59,332
Weak people rally around fame.
They worship it. They're blinded by it.

159
00:15:59,582 --> 00:16:02,335
There are many people
of weak character behind these walls.

160
00:16:02,501 --> 00:16:07,715
Yes, they will follow a man like this
and they will put him on a pedestal.

161
00:16:10,134 --> 00:16:13,054
He has that charisma, right, mommy?

162
00:16:13,638 --> 00:16:14,889
He's no you.

163
00:16:15,056 --> 00:16:17,767
Ah, you don't have to
pander me, mommy.

164
00:16:19,685 --> 00:16:21,562
He's good-looking, right?

165
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,402
He's the best-looking man
in the prison.

166
00:16:28,569 --> 00:16:29,904
Not compared to you.

167
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,531
I told you, mommy.

168
00:17:30,673 --> 00:17:31,715
Sara.

169
00:17:44,186 --> 00:17:46,605
Sara Tancredi,
an American. She's missing.

170
00:17:46,772 --> 00:17:49,233
We don't have a report like that.

171
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,318
But if you do, you call me.

172
00:17:51,485 --> 00:17:53,279
Okay, señor.

173
00:17:54,572 --> 00:17:56,824
- Anything, you call me, all right?
- Will do.

174
00:17:58,367 --> 00:17:59,410
Thank you.

175
00:18:08,502 --> 00:18:10,379
Where'd you get shoes?

176
00:18:17,011 --> 00:18:18,846
Hey, hey.

177
00:18:19,013 --> 00:18:21,015
It's time to start earning
your rent here.

178
00:18:21,182 --> 00:18:26,187
- There's no rent here, it's prison.
- Keep talking. It's going up. Here.

179
00:18:26,812 --> 00:18:29,523
Work time's started right now.

180
00:18:30,399 --> 00:18:31,525
Where?

181
00:18:33,736 --> 00:18:36,447
- Uh-uh. Hell, no.
- Absolutely not.

182
00:18:38,449 --> 00:18:42,202
One more word from you and I will
drown you in here. You understand?

183
00:18:44,371 --> 00:18:46,624
Now work.

184
00:18:47,124 --> 00:18:49,209
Burn it down in the sewers
when you're done.

185
00:19:57,027 --> 00:20:02,116
Scofield, a visitor. Scofield, a visitor.

186
00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:11,917
- Oh, Mr. Scofield. Elliott Pike.
- What do you want?

187
00:20:12,084 --> 00:20:15,129
- Well, to be frank, to represent you.
- You're a lawyer?

188
00:20:15,295 --> 00:20:18,090
- Of sorts.
- Court already appointed me a lawyer.

189
00:20:20,467 --> 00:20:24,680
Then perhaps I can be of assistance
in a different way.

190
00:20:24,847 --> 00:20:26,306
Somehow I doubt that.

191
00:20:26,473 --> 00:20:28,851
I got a lot of big guns behind me,
Mr. Scofield.

192
00:20:29,017 --> 00:20:31,478
People you might like
to have in your corner...

193
00:20:31,645 --> 00:20:35,065
...should you ever decide, say,
break out of here.

194
00:20:39,069 --> 00:20:40,154
Who are you?

195
00:20:40,612 --> 00:20:43,490
We can assist you
in every possible way...

196
00:20:43,657 --> 00:20:45,826
...once you get past that wall.

197
00:20:49,997 --> 00:20:52,583
There's a reason a guy like you
with your skill set...

198
00:20:52,749 --> 00:20:54,251
...was put in here, you know.

199
00:20:56,837 --> 00:21:00,257
- This conversation's over.
- You ought to hear what I have to say.

200
00:21:00,424 --> 00:21:02,718
We're trying to do this the easy way.

201
00:21:20,527 --> 00:21:22,237
Yo, yo, yo.

202
00:21:35,209 --> 00:21:38,503
What the hell you doing, taking
my stash? Come on, you little bitch.

203
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:41,048
- I didn't do it.
- Where is it? Where is it, huh?

204
00:21:41,215 --> 00:21:43,050
It wasn't me.

205
00:21:46,011 --> 00:21:47,638
Hey.

206
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,600
You know the rules
about extracurricular fights.

207
00:21:52,017 --> 00:21:53,310
It doesn't happen here.

208
00:21:53,477 --> 00:21:56,396
- He took something that belongs to me.
- He's out of his mind.

209
00:21:56,897 --> 00:21:59,983
Yeah? Seems pretty easy
to get to the bottom of this. Check him.

210
00:22:07,491 --> 00:22:09,076
Check his area.

211
00:22:20,629 --> 00:22:21,964
That's bull.

212
00:22:24,257 --> 00:22:27,594
You're both scumbags.

213
00:22:32,516 --> 00:22:34,768
You and me, man,
we're not done here.

214
00:22:40,524 --> 00:22:42,859
Haven't seen her?
No one like this has checked in?

215
00:22:43,026 --> 00:22:45,445
- No, señor.
- You're absolutely sure?

216
00:22:48,115 --> 00:22:49,157
Thanks.

217
00:22:51,368 --> 00:22:53,286
- Yeah?
- Mr. Burrows?

218
00:22:53,453 --> 00:22:56,123
Captain lzturis
of the Constable's office.

219
00:22:56,289 --> 00:22:58,291
We found an American woman...

220
00:22:58,458 --> 00:23:02,295
...matching the description
of your friend, Miss Tancredi.

221
00:23:02,462 --> 00:23:04,172
Where?

222
00:23:04,339 --> 00:23:06,299
At the morgue.

223
00:23:18,937 --> 00:23:21,440
- What's he saying?
- That we can't eat.

224
00:23:21,606 --> 00:23:23,150
What are we supposed to eat?

225
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:41,126
They expect us to forage, like dogs.

226
00:23:41,293 --> 00:23:45,046
I will die. I will literally die.

227
00:23:49,718 --> 00:23:51,511
Hang in there, man.

228
00:24:24,002 --> 00:24:26,713
Playing by yourself. Same old pretty.

229
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,216
Just not good at making friends,
are you?

230
00:24:29,382 --> 00:24:31,176
We got nothing to say to each other.

231
00:24:31,343 --> 00:24:34,679
On another note, them government types
that shook me down so hard...

232
00:24:34,846 --> 00:24:38,183
...why was it they wanted you here?
Was it Sona they was interested in?

233
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,517
That's what I'm thinking.

234
00:24:39,684 --> 00:24:42,062
Want me to get you down here,
in this very county.

235
00:24:42,229 --> 00:24:44,898
What do you think it is, huh?
You think it's Sona?

236
00:24:45,065 --> 00:24:47,359
Who'd be interested
in a dump like this?

237
00:24:47,525 --> 00:24:50,695
Runner! Runner!

238
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:16,012
Stop!

239
00:25:16,179 --> 00:25:18,348
No! No!

240
00:26:07,022 --> 00:26:09,190
- Thanks for getting back to me.
- No problem.

241
00:26:09,607 --> 00:26:12,402
Body was fished out of the pond
first thing this morning.

242
00:26:12,569 --> 00:26:13,611
Where?

243
00:26:14,028 --> 00:26:17,991
Calle Seisenta-Seis,
just west of Avenida Colon.

244
00:26:21,995 --> 00:26:23,037
Sir?

245
00:26:23,913 --> 00:26:25,832
It's the last place I saw her.

246
00:26:41,973 --> 00:26:43,683
It's not her.

247
00:26:45,518 --> 00:26:47,187
It's not her.

248
00:27:01,201 --> 00:27:04,370
Someone has thrown the glove
down on you. The gauntlet, right?

249
00:27:04,537 --> 00:27:07,040
Yeah, except we both know
I didn't take those drugs.

250
00:27:07,207 --> 00:27:10,835
I'm not a judge.
I don't deal in the claims people make.

251
00:27:11,002 --> 00:27:13,713
I just make sure rules are followed.
And the rules say...

252
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,716
...all grievances are dealt with.
Two men in a ring, a fight.

253
00:27:17,091 --> 00:27:19,719
I'll be leaving tomorrow,
so that won't be necessary.

254
00:27:20,136 --> 00:27:23,056
It may not be necessary to you,
but it is to me.

255
00:27:23,223 --> 00:27:27,143
I have a duty to maintain order here.
An iron-clad legal system...

256
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:30,647
...that insures that no one
goes independent with their grievances...

257
00:27:30,813 --> 00:27:33,149
...as is so often the case
in other prisons.

258
00:27:33,316 --> 00:27:37,320
Here there's a system,
and that system means honor.

259
00:27:37,487 --> 00:27:40,698
So whether you agree with it or not
does not matter to me.

260
00:27:41,074 --> 00:27:42,909
There's a larger agenda than yours.

261
00:27:47,205 --> 00:27:49,040
What happens if I refuse?

262
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:52,210
I will come for you.

263
00:27:53,378 --> 00:27:58,424
And I can guarantee you
that is an outcome that you will not like.

264
00:27:58,591 --> 00:28:01,678
Tell me something,
do you always set up your fights?

265
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,764
I had nothing to do with it.

266
00:28:05,181 --> 00:28:08,935
And yet the only one in this whole prison
who has a problem with me is you.

267
00:28:10,103 --> 00:28:12,272
I'll be glad to see you go down...

268
00:28:12,438 --> 00:28:14,315
...superstar.

269
00:28:25,451 --> 00:28:30,415
Go on. Keep going.
You burn it around the corner. Move it.

270
00:28:52,645 --> 00:28:54,105
Hey.

271
00:29:02,155 --> 00:29:03,448
Hey.

272
00:29:08,077 --> 00:29:09,495
Think you can do me a favor?

273
00:29:10,705 --> 00:29:14,125
- Bite me.
- I can feed you.

274
00:29:16,169 --> 00:29:19,964
A few weeks ago, I was in your shoes.
Didn't get any food for days.

275
00:29:20,131 --> 00:29:22,717
They'd have let me die,
like they're gonna let you die.

276
00:29:22,884 --> 00:29:24,510
Get back to the feed-me part.

277
00:29:30,433 --> 00:29:34,020
Chicken.
Man, where'd you get chicken?

278
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,813
That's not chicken.

279
00:29:41,527 --> 00:29:44,530
- Want some more?
- Yeah.

280
00:29:44,864 --> 00:29:47,325
Then you're gonna have to
run an errand for me.

281
00:29:47,492 --> 00:29:49,202
What kind of errand?

282
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:59,837
- Yeah.
- Dad? It's me.

283
00:30:00,004 --> 00:30:03,174
- L.J. Where are you?
- I'm in Panama.

284
00:30:04,467 --> 00:30:06,052
What?

285
00:30:07,553 --> 00:30:09,680
- How'd you get this number?
- I ran into Sara.

286
00:30:09,847 --> 00:30:11,724
She got your number
from the consulate.

287
00:30:11,891 --> 00:30:13,851
Dad, I-- Right now--

288
00:30:14,018 --> 00:30:16,521
- I can't hear you.
- Dad? Do this.

289
00:30:16,687 --> 00:30:20,233
Meet us at the restaurant
in the Garfield Price Building at the top.

290
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:23,152
- Garfield what?
- 8:30.

291
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,793
Hey, there's a fight.

292
00:30:45,341 --> 00:30:47,718
Have to make your peace
with God, eh?

293
00:30:51,931 --> 00:30:53,724
Uno, dos, tres, all right?

294
00:30:56,811 --> 00:30:58,104
What, even at 10-to-1?

295
00:30:58,271 --> 00:31:02,567
Man, there's a reason he chose World.
Six consecutive life terms, okay? Hey.

296
00:31:15,288 --> 00:31:16,539
I'm just kidding, man.

297
00:31:25,631 --> 00:31:27,800
Surely it's beneath
a man of your status...

298
00:31:27,967 --> 00:31:30,803
...to be walking around like that,
all sticky-like.

299
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:33,973
Hey, leave him. What do you propose?

300
00:31:35,641 --> 00:31:36,809
Ablution.

301
00:31:39,145 --> 00:31:43,524
A humble sign of friendship from
a stranger who's come into your house.

302
00:31:52,658 --> 00:31:53,993
Sorry about that.

303
00:31:55,328 --> 00:31:57,705
Just half a man down here.

304
00:32:00,416 --> 00:32:02,043
What's your name, norteño?

305
00:32:02,835 --> 00:32:06,839
You can just call me friend.

306
00:32:16,015 --> 00:32:18,059
Go for the kneecap.

307
00:32:19,101 --> 00:32:20,728
You, uh...

308
00:32:21,437 --> 00:32:25,983
You hit it straight on, it'll buckle
and it'll take the guy out of commission.

309
00:32:26,525 --> 00:32:28,694
Fighting dirty? That's your secret?

310
00:32:29,153 --> 00:32:33,032
I didn't think there was any such thing
as clean in a place like this.

311
00:32:34,116 --> 00:32:36,035
You know, I'm surprised, Alex.

312
00:32:36,202 --> 00:32:38,204
It almost sounds like you care.

313
00:32:39,038 --> 00:32:41,290
You're my get-out-of-jail-free card.

314
00:32:43,209 --> 00:32:44,919
Just survive.

315
00:32:47,213 --> 00:32:48,881
Kneecap, really hard.

316
00:33:29,421 --> 00:33:31,173
Good luck, man.

317
00:33:59,702 --> 00:34:01,287
God bless, man.

318
00:34:11,672 --> 00:34:13,465
We have a disagreement...

319
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:15,301
...between two dogs.

320
00:34:15,467 --> 00:34:17,720
A drug addict and a thief.

321
00:34:18,095 --> 00:34:19,972
I condone neither...

322
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:22,433
...and I wash my hands
of both of them.

323
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,477
But they have an issue
and we have rules.

324
00:34:25,644 --> 00:34:28,480
And without rules,
we are nothing but savages.

325
00:34:28,647 --> 00:34:31,483
Therefore, with proper respect
for the rules...

326
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:34,695
...this fight is engaged
with only one rule:

327
00:34:34,862 --> 00:34:36,488
No weapons.

328
00:34:36,864 --> 00:34:38,449
Only man versus man...

329
00:34:38,615 --> 00:34:41,243
...without augmentation or handicap.

330
00:34:42,703 --> 00:34:44,663
I'm done talking.

331
00:34:55,591 --> 00:34:57,217
I'm not gonna fight.

332
00:35:06,852 --> 00:35:07,936
Get him.

333
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:33,545
I don't think
you understand the rules, friend.

334
00:35:34,296 --> 00:35:36,006
Only one man comes out alive.

335
00:36:10,874 --> 00:36:12,751
- It's over.
- Finish him.

336
00:36:12,918 --> 00:36:15,754
- Let me through. Let me go.
- Finish him.

337
00:36:31,103 --> 00:36:32,688
No weapons.

338
00:36:33,105 --> 00:36:34,773
Rules are rules, remember?

339
00:36:37,526 --> 00:36:39,278
And if we don't have them...

340
00:36:40,279 --> 00:36:41,530
...we're savages.

341
00:37:06,638 --> 00:37:08,974
Oh, excuse me. You have no jacket.

342
00:37:09,141 --> 00:37:10,767
Oh, come on, man. Give me a break.

343
00:37:10,934 --> 00:37:14,229
Well, this is a nice place.
It requires jackets.

344
00:37:14,646 --> 00:37:17,983
- Well, I don't have a jacket.
- It requires jackets.

345
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:20,819
Fine.

346
00:37:29,036 --> 00:37:32,205
Excuse me. You speak English?

347
00:37:32,372 --> 00:37:34,207
How about American?

348
00:37:49,514 --> 00:37:51,642
Could I have a water, please?

349
00:37:52,267 --> 00:37:55,687
Please tell me you didn't come
all the way to Panama for the water.

350
00:37:58,523 --> 00:38:00,275
Family.

351
00:38:02,361 --> 00:38:04,821
That's a nice jacket, "Sergio."

352
00:38:06,073 --> 00:38:08,116
It's a long story.

353
00:38:08,283 --> 00:38:09,618
Thank you.

354
00:38:11,078 --> 00:38:13,288
- You're waiting for someone, huh?
- Mm-hm.

355
00:38:13,455 --> 00:38:16,708
I should've known.
Good-looking ones are always taken.

356
00:38:21,046 --> 00:38:23,215
What happened to your face?

357
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:26,385
- Cat.
- Cat? That's a big cat.

358
00:38:26,885 --> 00:38:30,514
You push anything too far into a corner
and the claws will come out.

359
00:38:33,225 --> 00:38:36,019
- Your timing's all wrong, lady.
- Oh, come on, hang out.

360
00:38:36,186 --> 00:38:37,562
I'd like to...

361
00:38:38,146 --> 00:38:40,565
...but it ain't the right time.

362
00:38:42,984 --> 00:38:45,404
Yes, it is, Lincoln.

363
00:38:48,573 --> 00:38:50,951
We have a lot to discuss.

364
00:38:51,118 --> 00:38:52,744
Specifically, your brother.

365
00:38:58,375 --> 00:39:01,128
I highly suggest you talk to him.

366
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,372
Hey!

367
00:41:26,189 --> 00:41:27,690
Hey.

368
00:41:29,901 --> 00:41:31,736
How are we coming with the transfer?

369
00:41:34,364 --> 00:41:37,659
There are some people that want
you to break someone out of there.

370
00:41:37,826 --> 00:41:40,078
Yeah, I know.
Some guy already approached me.

371
00:41:40,245 --> 00:41:41,538
I said no, thank you.

372
00:41:42,038 --> 00:41:43,373
You gotta stay.

373
00:41:44,916 --> 00:41:46,084
What are you talking about?

374
00:41:46,543 --> 00:41:48,086
His name's James Whistler.

375
00:41:48,253 --> 00:41:52,424
- No, no, no, Linc. I can't do that again.
- Michael, Mike...

376
00:41:56,719 --> 00:41:58,138
Talk!

377
00:41:58,304 --> 00:41:59,681
Dad.

378
00:42:00,515 --> 00:42:04,602
Dad, I'm so sorry.
They got me and Sara.

379
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,274
Please, do what they want.
Dad, please.

380
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:13,403
You got a week
to find this Whistler guy...

381
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:14,946
...and get him out of there.

382
00:42:15,113 --> 00:42:17,949
Otherwise, they-- Sara and L.J.--

383
00:42:18,491 --> 00:42:20,535
They both die.
