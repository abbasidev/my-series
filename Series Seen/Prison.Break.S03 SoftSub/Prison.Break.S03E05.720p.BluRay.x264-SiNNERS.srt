1
00:00:02,318 --> 00:00:03,945
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:04,112 --> 00:00:07,448
L.J. and Sara will be traded for Whistler.
Are we clear?

3
00:00:07,615 --> 00:00:10,868
- This can't be done in a week.
- You have a week, that's it.

4
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:14,580
No one's broken out of this place,
let alone with a week to plan it.

5
00:00:14,747 --> 00:00:19,127
So tell these people, I'm gonna break
this guy out or I'm gonna die trying.

6
00:00:19,335 --> 00:00:22,588
You're gonna stay on as my ears.

7
00:00:22,755 --> 00:00:27,218
Report back to me everything you hear
when I'm not around.

8
00:00:27,385 --> 00:00:29,637
You've got a brother
helping on the outside.

9
00:00:29,804 --> 00:00:33,266
He ran into my girlfriend
and took a book that belongs to me.

10
00:00:33,432 --> 00:00:36,644
This is what they took from me,
so let's be clear.

11
00:00:36,811 --> 00:00:43,317
This is what matters to me.
Not you and not your book.

12
00:00:43,693 --> 00:00:45,403
How's L.J.? How's Sara?

13
00:00:46,571 --> 00:00:49,448
- They told me they're fine.
- What are you not telling me?

14
00:00:52,577 --> 00:00:56,080
- Not the only one affected--
- Killed Sara and put her head in a box.

15
00:00:56,247 --> 00:00:57,790
They've got my son.

16
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:23,477
J.P. Getty had a formula for success.

17
00:03:24,353 --> 00:03:29,942
Rise early, work hard, strike oil.

18
00:03:30,151 --> 00:03:33,028
I'm just trying
to get a drink of water, Alex.

19
00:03:34,488 --> 00:03:37,616
As a devoted student
of your work and skills...

20
00:03:37,825 --> 00:03:41,495
...I really look forward
to the progress on your plan, Michael.

21
00:03:41,662 --> 00:03:44,206
I'm looking forward to you
getting off my back.

22
00:03:54,258 --> 00:03:58,721
Buenos, welcome to Sona.
Is that your wallet?

23
00:04:07,855 --> 00:04:09,231
You know what I said.

24
00:04:09,982 --> 00:04:11,108
No.

25
00:04:13,527 --> 00:04:15,863
That's the wrong answer.

26
00:04:24,413 --> 00:04:27,750
I'm so ready to get out of here
anytime you are.

27
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,553
Scofield, you have a visitor.

28
00:04:42,681 --> 00:04:45,935
- Looks like you had a long night.
- Yeah.

29
00:04:46,435 --> 00:04:49,271
Spent most of it
feeding chocolate to a rat.

30
00:04:49,438 --> 00:04:52,358
I don't have a whole lot to work with
these days.

31
00:04:53,067 --> 00:04:57,488
She's got the book, man. The bird guide.
She worked it out.

32
00:04:57,655 --> 00:05:00,366
- So we have no leverage.
- No.

33
00:05:00,574 --> 00:05:03,160
Tell me,
when you were handing over the book...

34
00:05:03,327 --> 00:05:05,829
...did you ask for a recent photo
of L.J. and Sara?

35
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,582
- Yeah.
- Well, where is it?

36
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:11,168
She showed me,
but she wouldn't let me keep them.

37
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:14,588
I'm not in a position to bargain
with these people, they're pissed.

38
00:05:14,797 --> 00:05:16,131
You break out tomorrow.

39
00:05:16,298 --> 00:05:19,468
Let's just focus on that.
Let's keep on track.

40
00:05:20,135 --> 00:05:22,012
All right.

41
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:27,434
While I'm working from the inside,
you take care of what happens outside.

42
00:05:27,643 --> 00:05:30,521
We're gonna need a getaway vehicle,
something inconspicuous.

43
00:05:30,688 --> 00:05:34,149
What you find has to be parked half
a mile from here by 3 p.m. tomorrow.

44
00:05:34,316 --> 00:05:36,819
- You mean a.m.
- No, I mean p.m.

45
00:05:37,861 --> 00:05:39,613
We don't have a choice, Linc.

46
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,575
I ran some tests last night.
Jeeps patrol the perimeter at night.

47
00:05:44,201 --> 00:05:46,787
No way of telling
where they're gonna be in the dark.

48
00:05:46,995 --> 00:05:49,206
They were out there all night.

49
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:52,835
- We need the dark, we can't--
- Just-- Please.

50
00:05:54,712 --> 00:05:59,091
Because we're doing this tomorrow,
in the middle of the day.

51
00:06:23,407 --> 00:06:24,575
Who you looking at?

52
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:27,161
That guy.

53
00:06:30,497 --> 00:06:31,748
I know him.

54
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:14,958
McGrady, my friend,
I'm gonna need a watch, maybe two.

55
00:07:15,167 --> 00:07:17,628
I'm not even gonna ask why.

56
00:07:18,837 --> 00:07:20,589
Uh... I'm also gonna need
some binoculars.

57
00:07:22,382 --> 00:07:23,800
Old Guillermo has a pair.

58
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:28,222
There's no way he'll sell them to you
but they shouldn't be hard to get.

59
00:07:28,388 --> 00:07:30,766
Where can I find this guy?

60
00:07:51,495 --> 00:07:53,038
We're leaving tomorrow.

61
00:07:58,794 --> 00:08:00,295
This...

62
00:08:05,092 --> 00:08:06,760
This is how we get out of Sona.

63
00:08:06,927 --> 00:08:09,680
Getting out of the cellblock
shouldn't be a problem.

64
00:08:09,846 --> 00:08:11,556
The grate and the bars are weak.

65
00:08:11,723 --> 00:08:15,519
But we need some rope, some ladder,
to let us down on the other side.

66
00:08:15,727 --> 00:08:18,730
Figured out the safest line
from here to the hole in the fence.

67
00:08:18,897 --> 00:08:22,776
We do it in the day, we'll only be visible
to the two guard towers.

68
00:08:22,943 --> 00:08:26,279
Perimeter guards are less predictable,
but they're only on at night.

69
00:08:26,488 --> 00:08:28,573
Scurrying across field
in middle of the day?

70
00:08:28,782 --> 00:08:30,909
It's the only way to avoid
the jeep patrol.

71
00:08:31,076 --> 00:08:33,578
In the yard tomorrow,
there's a soccer game at 2.

72
00:08:33,787 --> 00:08:35,914
That should provide
some distraction inside.

73
00:08:36,123 --> 00:08:37,749
Yesterday, when we're digging...

74
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:41,420
...I saw the glare from the sun
hit this guy in the late afternoon.

75
00:08:41,586 --> 00:08:44,506
Like he had to turn away.
Like maybe his vision was blocked.

76
00:08:44,673 --> 00:08:47,384
- It's not much of a break.
- No.

77
00:08:47,551 --> 00:08:49,928
But it is one way to do
what we need to do.

78
00:08:50,095 --> 00:08:53,640
As far as this other guard,
his weakness is yet to be determined.

79
00:08:57,811 --> 00:09:03,442
If we're gonna get around these guys,
we gotta get to know them.

80
00:09:05,193 --> 00:09:06,653
It's not gonna be easy.

81
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,031
- There's one real road that--
- We don't want a real road.

82
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,408
That's not an option.

83
00:09:18,373 --> 00:09:21,251
- What?
- Your brother's cutting it close.

84
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,336
- You said a week.
- Tomorrow's Wednesday.

85
00:09:23,503 --> 00:09:25,922
- Didn't leave room for error.
- There's no error.

86
00:09:26,089 --> 00:09:29,926
- Listen, I got stuff to do, and I just--
- Which is why I won't waste your time.

87
00:09:30,093 --> 00:09:32,137
When Whistler's free,
I need to get to him.

88
00:09:32,304 --> 00:09:35,182
Still trying to work out
what's gonna happen past the fence.

89
00:09:35,348 --> 00:09:38,852
- Once I know all the details, I'll let you--
- Lincoln, calm down.

90
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,731
Sounds to me like you and your brother
are in over your heads.

91
00:09:42,898 --> 00:09:45,442
There's a bad joke
about Sara somewhere in there.

92
00:09:45,609 --> 00:09:52,073
Listen, I'll let you know all the details
once I know them, and then I'll call you.

93
00:09:52,908 --> 00:09:55,285
I want this to work out
just as badly as you do.

94
00:09:55,452 --> 00:09:57,412
More, I'm sure.

95
00:09:58,371 --> 00:09:59,498
L.J.?

96
00:09:59,664 --> 00:10:02,584
L.J.'s fine. You have 34 hours.

97
00:10:04,377 --> 00:10:08,131
- What did she say?
- Nothing we don't already know.

98
00:10:08,298 --> 00:10:10,759
Let's get out of here.
We got a lot of stuff to do.

99
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:34,157
No, no.

100
00:11:46,604 --> 00:11:48,064
Wouldn't let them see you do that.

101
00:11:50,525 --> 00:11:51,901
- Who?
- Anyone.

102
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,612
It's a drinking fountain.
They put their lips there.

103
00:11:54,821 --> 00:11:57,282
You'd think it spit straight
Jack Daniels.

104
00:11:58,032 --> 00:11:59,701
You understand what happened?

105
00:12:00,201 --> 00:12:02,537
You're a whatchamacallit, pariah.

106
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:06,624
Made same mistake when I walked in,
tried to hang on to my wallet.

107
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:10,628
Next thing I knew, I spent two days
kneecap-deep in human feces.

108
00:12:11,755 --> 00:12:15,550
In Sona, it's every man for himself.
Here, cheese.

109
00:12:16,134 --> 00:12:18,928
- I'm not hungry.
- Yeah, you will be.

110
00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:24,726
I saw the other Americans.
So none of you have called the embassy?

111
00:12:24,893 --> 00:12:29,230
Us gringos ain't all butt buddies.
You want it? Because I'll keep it.

112
00:12:47,957 --> 00:12:49,209
Let's get this done.

113
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:52,003
We're gonna have to watch
both guards simultaneously.

114
00:12:52,212 --> 00:12:55,632
Your cell should provide a good view
of the guard I saw yesterday.

115
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,218
Track everything he does
and when he does it.

116
00:12:58,426 --> 00:13:01,179
Look for that glare.
See if it shows up again.

117
00:13:01,346 --> 00:13:04,516
- What will you be doing?
- Watching the other tower from here.

118
00:13:04,724 --> 00:13:06,601
With our backs turned,
need a lookout.

119
00:13:06,809 --> 00:13:11,898
- Well, find Mahone.
- I thought we were stringing him along.

120
00:13:12,106 --> 00:13:14,359
Looks like we're out of string.

121
00:13:21,032 --> 00:13:22,325
Teodoro.

122
00:13:23,618 --> 00:13:25,870
What do they say
about all work and no play?

123
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,582
- A boy need his rest.
- Your clientele keeps a tight schedule.

124
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:32,460
Gotta make sure I see to their needs.

125
00:13:35,672 --> 00:13:37,382
I gave you a more important task.

126
00:13:38,883 --> 00:13:42,679
- But I haven't heard a thing.
- Then listen harder.

127
00:13:58,987 --> 00:14:01,072
Come into my office.

128
00:14:02,198 --> 00:14:04,909
Sit down. Watch the game.

129
00:14:13,084 --> 00:14:15,003
Excuse me.

130
00:14:22,343 --> 00:14:26,806
- Anything yet?
- No, not yet.

131
00:14:28,516 --> 00:14:31,060
So, what's your story, Mahone?

132
00:14:31,978 --> 00:14:34,439
I mean, the next chapter,
when we get out of here.

133
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:39,193
Suppose you were married to the job.

134
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,448
Drank too much, rabid insomniac,
typical lawman.

135
00:14:43,614 --> 00:14:48,453
Yeah, just like you reek of live bait
and have a girl in every port.

136
00:14:48,619 --> 00:14:52,623
Tell fish stories, or so I've heard.

137
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:56,919
Prior to this experience,
I had the utmost respect for the law.

138
00:14:59,213 --> 00:15:02,216
This guy hasn't so much
as scratched his jock in an hour.

139
00:15:02,383 --> 00:15:05,803
It's not gonna be easy
to get around that guy.

140
00:15:09,474 --> 00:15:10,933
Maybe not.

141
00:15:23,404 --> 00:15:26,199
You know,
we might just have a break.

142
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:30,286
I'm gonna go check on Scofield.

143
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,878
Sorry.

144
00:16:21,796 --> 00:16:24,507
- Did you see the glare?
- Hit him hard at 3:13.

145
00:16:24,674 --> 00:16:27,760
Turned to his right and ignored the west
for next six minutes.

146
00:16:27,927 --> 00:16:29,679
As far as I could tell.

147
00:16:31,472 --> 00:16:34,684
This guy thinks he's auditioning
for Buckingham Palace.

148
00:16:34,892 --> 00:16:38,563
But he's also a sports fan.
He's got a TV.

149
00:16:38,771 --> 00:16:41,816
Twice in the last four hours,
the signal got fuzzy.

150
00:16:42,024 --> 00:16:44,569
He had to turn to adjust the antenna.

151
00:16:44,777 --> 00:16:48,114
- That's nothing we can count on.
- True.

152
00:16:48,322 --> 00:16:51,951
But there is a device we can build
out of some pretty common materials.

153
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:56,163
It's almost like a radio,
except it transmits signals.

154
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:01,168
Hey, watch it, man.

155
00:17:18,227 --> 00:17:19,312
Oof.

156
00:17:19,478 --> 00:17:22,481
- Pardon me.
- You're the new guy.

157
00:17:22,648 --> 00:17:25,401
- Yeah, and who are you?
- Not the new guy.

158
00:17:25,901 --> 00:17:29,530
So, what's your deal? Public intoxication,
tourist in trouble, what is it?

159
00:17:29,739 --> 00:17:32,616
I don't like people asking questions
when I've done nothing.

160
00:17:32,825 --> 00:17:35,911
- You're an innocent man?
- As a matter of fact, yes.

161
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,456
- Is this your first time in prison?
- Uh-huh. Why?

162
00:17:38,664 --> 00:17:41,876
Because it's obvious. Rule number one:
Mind your own business.

163
00:17:42,084 --> 00:17:44,045
You know,
you might wanna do the same.

164
00:17:44,253 --> 00:17:47,173
You know what I'm talking about.
You got it?

165
00:17:48,966 --> 00:17:51,135
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

166
00:17:51,343 --> 00:17:53,637
- I got it.
- Then take a walk.

167
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:09,403
When did you meet
your boyfriend? Whistler?

168
00:18:10,446 --> 00:18:15,367
My last year of school.
I worked in this place in San lsabel.

169
00:18:16,035 --> 00:18:19,121
He used to come around by himself
and sit down at the bar.

170
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:21,499
Hitting on the waitress.
That's romantic.

171
00:18:21,707 --> 00:18:23,167
He is.

172
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:26,545
Every time he goes away,
he brings me back a present.

173
00:18:27,213 --> 00:18:29,965
Like this. Those are from Scottsdale.

174
00:18:30,132 --> 00:18:33,010
His mother lives there
in a retirement home.

175
00:18:35,137 --> 00:18:36,180
What's going on?

176
00:18:36,347 --> 00:18:38,265
- Out of the car.
- What's going on?

177
00:18:38,474 --> 00:18:41,268
- This is a private road.
- I can explain--

178
00:18:41,477 --> 00:18:44,146
- What'd we do?
- Shut your mouth, Americano.

179
00:18:44,355 --> 00:18:47,066
This is state property.
No vehicles allowed.

180
00:18:47,274 --> 00:18:49,652
All roads within two miles of Sona
are closed.

181
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,904
- We didn't see any signs.
- Where you going?

182
00:18:52,112 --> 00:18:54,532
- San lsabel.
- San lsabel?

183
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,950
- Yeah.
- This your car?

184
00:19:11,632 --> 00:19:13,425
This road is not for tourists.

185
00:19:15,469 --> 00:19:18,848
If I ever catch you out here again,
I'll remember you.

186
00:19:19,056 --> 00:19:21,392
- It ain't gonna happen again.
- Get going.

187
00:19:25,604 --> 00:19:27,398
- You okay?
- Yeah.

188
00:19:27,565 --> 00:19:30,150
- This is not gonna work.
- Where's the coast from here?

189
00:19:30,317 --> 00:19:34,113
- I don't know, maybe three miles.
- All right, time for Plan B. Come on.

190
00:19:39,535 --> 00:19:42,413
Found some more of these.
We can make a rope out of this.

191
00:19:47,918 --> 00:19:50,337
Come on,
you don't wanna go in there.

192
00:19:50,546 --> 00:19:52,464
If we wanna get out of here, I do.

193
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,592
Stay here.

194
00:20:05,561 --> 00:20:10,024
Hey, hey, hey. Move it.
Come on.

195
00:20:14,737 --> 00:20:16,280
What, is it chained down?

196
00:20:16,488 --> 00:20:19,325
- It's hanging by a thread.
- It'll have to wait.

197
00:20:19,533 --> 00:20:20,784
It's 4:30.

198
00:20:20,993 --> 00:20:23,037
- We got less than 24 hours.
- We'll make it.

199
00:20:23,203 --> 00:20:24,663
- Tell me why.
- What?

200
00:20:24,872 --> 00:20:27,166
Why can't we get you out
day after tomorrow?

201
00:20:27,374 --> 00:20:29,752
I don't know.
I don't have all the answers.

202
00:20:31,253 --> 00:20:33,047
You don't know me,
I don't know you...

203
00:20:33,213 --> 00:20:35,674
...but it's your job
to get me out of here.

204
00:20:37,092 --> 00:20:39,094
We'll come back later.

205
00:20:45,392 --> 00:20:47,436
- I'll take this.
- Down here for the summer?

206
00:20:47,603 --> 00:20:49,188
- Yep.
- That's what I thought.

207
00:20:49,355 --> 00:20:54,026
Back in 1985, two wives, 20 years later.
You want everything in here?

208
00:20:54,234 --> 00:20:57,738
Yeah, thanks.
International waters, how far out?

209
00:20:57,905 --> 00:21:01,075
- It's 12 nautical miles.
- Twelve nautical miles, huh?

210
00:21:01,241 --> 00:21:03,118
- Is that gonna do it here?
- Yeah.

211
00:21:04,161 --> 00:21:05,579
Ninety-nine twenty-five.

212
00:21:07,081 --> 00:21:08,540
- Here.
- All right.

213
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,293
Thank you.

214
00:21:12,461 --> 00:21:13,921
- What did you get?
- Supplies.

215
00:21:14,088 --> 00:21:16,590
- Could you pop the trunk?
- Who am I gonna tell?

216
00:21:16,757 --> 00:21:18,926
Could be a Russian spy, for all I know.

217
00:21:21,303 --> 00:21:25,099
- You live out of this thing?
- Be prepared in case of an emergency.

218
00:21:25,265 --> 00:21:28,227
Well, we got an emergency.

219
00:21:28,602 --> 00:21:30,938
I'm not going
till you tell me where we're going.

220
00:21:31,146 --> 00:21:33,357
- Solana Beach.
- Why?

221
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:42,741
They killed Sara, and I'm trying
to make sure they don't kill my son.

222
00:21:43,575 --> 00:21:46,537
If you don't think your boy's
not on that list, stay here.

223
00:21:46,703 --> 00:21:48,580
Couldn't care less.

224
00:22:13,438 --> 00:22:17,818
- What is it?
- It's Augusto.

225
00:22:18,527 --> 00:22:20,988
He won't pay
the payment for you anymore.

226
00:22:23,282 --> 00:22:25,701
I went to him for payment,
like every Monday...

227
00:22:25,868 --> 00:22:31,748
...and he said it's not his responsibility
and that I should ask you.

228
00:22:31,915 --> 00:22:34,293
No, no, no.

229
00:22:34,501 --> 00:22:39,214
You tell Augusto I don't pay for sex.

230
00:22:39,423 --> 00:22:41,592
I know. I did.

231
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,512
But what do I do?
I don't see anyone else.

232
00:22:45,721 --> 00:22:48,890
Yeah? Well, neither do I.

233
00:23:43,987 --> 00:23:47,949
On the other side, when we
get out of here, what's gonna happen?

234
00:23:48,116 --> 00:23:51,578
- Meet someone from this Company?
- Apparently.

235
00:23:52,537 --> 00:23:55,165
And then they're gonna kill me.
You know that.

236
00:23:55,374 --> 00:23:58,085
If they wanted to kill you,
you'd already be dead.

237
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:00,587
I don't see why they keep me alive.

238
00:24:00,796 --> 00:24:04,299
It's like you said:
You've got something they want.

239
00:24:04,466 --> 00:24:07,886
Once I give it to them,
I'll be no use to them, right?

240
00:24:08,095 --> 00:24:12,307
I don't have all the answers. All I know
is it's my job to get you out of here.

241
00:24:12,516 --> 00:24:14,851
Food's here!

242
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,311
Let's go.

243
00:24:34,621 --> 00:24:37,707
It's "Two-for Tuesday."
My one-time special, just for you.

244
00:24:37,874 --> 00:24:39,209
But there's a price.

245
00:24:39,376 --> 00:24:42,003
Lechero's getting pretty sensitive
about the cash flow.

246
00:24:42,212 --> 00:24:45,298
- Well, I'm a little short right now.
- No worries, Alex.

247
00:24:45,465 --> 00:24:48,343
I am not gonna leave you
hanging, all right?

248
00:24:49,052 --> 00:24:50,720
We can just start you a tab.

249
00:25:22,794 --> 00:25:26,673
- How is a microwave gonna help us?
- I guess we'll find out.

250
00:26:31,613 --> 00:26:32,947
Our third year in school...

251
00:26:33,114 --> 00:26:36,159
...we studied electrical engineering
with a focus on EMPs.

252
00:26:36,326 --> 00:26:39,162
That's electromagnetic pulses.

253
00:26:39,371 --> 00:26:42,999
You hook up a power source
to a transmitter and it generates a pulse.

254
00:26:44,042 --> 00:26:46,086
That pulse crashes anything
electronic.

255
00:26:46,252 --> 00:26:49,964
What's that,
like an intro into anti-terrorist tactics?

256
00:26:50,173 --> 00:26:51,216
Basically.

257
00:26:51,383 --> 00:26:54,886
These days, they have to teach students
how to defend their structures.

258
00:26:55,095 --> 00:26:59,808
Fortunately for us, that guard tower
was engineered a long time ago.

259
00:27:00,016 --> 00:27:03,645
I'm guessing you always won
the elementary science fair.

260
00:27:06,022 --> 00:27:07,857
Plug this in.

261
00:27:28,962 --> 00:27:30,422
Did it crash the telly?

262
00:27:31,339 --> 00:27:33,675
We're too far away.

263
00:27:34,509 --> 00:27:36,678
But it is doing exactly what
we need it to--

264
00:27:36,845 --> 00:27:38,304
Shh, shh.

265
00:27:41,766 --> 00:27:43,268
Okay.

266
00:27:56,656 --> 00:27:57,991
- Get out.
- Why?

267
00:27:58,158 --> 00:27:59,951
They're coming in.

268
00:28:03,913 --> 00:28:08,668
Colonel's coming. Just stay here.
Do not let him see her. Do not.

269
00:28:11,337 --> 00:28:13,756
- Come on.
- Huh?

270
00:28:14,465 --> 00:28:15,717
Go! Go!

271
00:28:16,384 --> 00:28:18,636
Everybody get down.

272
00:28:22,724 --> 00:28:25,310
Everyone on your knees.

273
00:28:40,241 --> 00:28:41,326
Colonel.

274
00:28:42,827 --> 00:28:44,287
We received no word of this.

275
00:28:44,787 --> 00:28:47,373
A rifle scope
was seen from the tower.

276
00:28:47,582 --> 00:28:49,792
Capitán Hurtado
saw it with his own eyes.

277
00:28:50,001 --> 00:28:51,502
That's impossible.

278
00:28:51,669 --> 00:28:56,049
There is a gun in your prison,
and it was pointing at one of my men.

279
00:28:56,257 --> 00:28:58,176
We are going to find it.

280
00:29:18,655 --> 00:29:20,490
- This looks good.
- For what?

281
00:29:20,657 --> 00:29:21,866
Have a seat.

282
00:29:22,033 --> 00:29:25,578
- What am I supposed to be doing here?
- Look like you're having fun.

283
00:29:32,001 --> 00:29:34,671
When was the last time
you saw your son?

284
00:29:37,882 --> 00:29:40,510
Lincoln, I don't automatically
trust people either...

285
00:29:40,718 --> 00:29:43,054
...but I can tell
when they have good intentions.

286
00:29:43,221 --> 00:29:45,056
Good for you.

287
00:29:46,808 --> 00:29:49,644
You know, I'm not gonna try
to prove myself anymore.

288
00:29:49,852 --> 00:29:53,106
You do your job and I do mine.

289
00:30:04,909 --> 00:30:06,536
- You need something?
- What?

290
00:30:06,703 --> 00:30:07,829
You need something?

291
00:30:10,581 --> 00:30:12,458
- No.
- Good.

292
00:30:33,229 --> 00:30:36,107
- Don't you worry, it's all gonna be okay.
- No, it's not.

293
00:30:36,274 --> 00:30:38,818
I promise,
I will not let anyone find you in here.

294
00:30:39,026 --> 00:30:41,779
- No, Lechero hate me.
- Lechero does not hate you.

295
00:30:41,946 --> 00:30:44,115
You hold a very special place
in his heart.

296
00:30:44,282 --> 00:30:46,117
So many girls can take my place.

297
00:30:46,284 --> 00:30:48,995
He's smart, he knows you're better.
You're a real woman.

298
00:30:49,162 --> 00:30:51,497
A woman with her own will,
her own desire.

299
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:53,583
You know what I am.

300
00:30:53,749 --> 00:30:56,836
In this world, sister,
we are all prostitutes.

301
00:30:57,003 --> 00:30:58,880
You are a queen.

302
00:31:02,758 --> 00:31:04,093
Shh, shh...

303
00:31:53,517 --> 00:31:56,145
Whose cell is that? In the corner?

304
00:32:00,191 --> 00:32:01,984
Is that your cell?

305
00:32:11,911 --> 00:32:16,248
- You, is that your cell?
- It's mine. It's mine.

306
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:21,504
It's mine.

307
00:32:26,717 --> 00:32:28,511
I found this.

308
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,472
It's not a weapon.

309
00:32:33,849 --> 00:32:36,310
I know what it is.

310
00:32:42,316 --> 00:32:44,193
Why were you watching me?

311
00:33:01,168 --> 00:33:06,507
I'm going to ask you one more time.
Why were you watching me?

312
00:33:07,717 --> 00:33:10,094
- I wasn't watching you.
- I saw you.

313
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,847
- Answer.
- Don't know what you saw...

314
00:33:13,013 --> 00:33:15,057
...but I wasn't watching you.

315
00:33:18,394 --> 00:33:20,062
I wasn't watching--

316
00:33:24,859 --> 00:33:26,110
It's mine.

317
00:33:33,367 --> 00:33:35,494
Why were you watching him?

318
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:41,917
I wasn't. I was, uh, watching birds.

319
00:33:42,877 --> 00:33:46,505
Yes. Yes.

320
00:33:50,217 --> 00:33:52,136
You see?

321
00:34:04,899 --> 00:34:07,443
Why did you not speak up before?

322
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,361
I, uh...

323
00:34:14,158 --> 00:34:15,868
I was scared.

324
00:34:19,622 --> 00:34:20,831
I was scared.

325
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:06,627
Come on.

326
00:35:06,794 --> 00:35:10,673
Come on. Please, please, please.

327
00:35:30,734 --> 00:35:32,945
He's coming back up here.

328
00:35:33,153 --> 00:35:35,864
Now, don't worry.
It's all gonna be okay.

329
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,660
You have a little mascara right there.

330
00:35:44,498 --> 00:35:47,042
You need to look pretty for Lechero.

331
00:35:52,256 --> 00:35:54,133
Thank you.

332
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:57,136
Wait right here.

333
00:36:03,517 --> 00:36:07,062
The patrol passed, but didn't stay.
Knocked things over, then walked away.

334
00:36:07,271 --> 00:36:08,939
I hid your woman in a safe place...

335
00:36:09,148 --> 00:36:12,067
...but I'd be lying
if I didn't say it was a close call.

336
00:36:12,276 --> 00:36:15,112
- She alone?
- Yeah.

337
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,912
Hey, look...

338
00:36:24,455 --> 00:36:29,918
Don't be afraid.
Not now, my dear. They're gone.

339
00:36:31,003 --> 00:36:33,672
- I should go too.
- Oh, no, no, what's your rush?

340
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,216
- Come.
- No, I should get home.

341
00:36:41,013 --> 00:36:42,931
Patrón, I gave her the money.

342
00:36:44,975 --> 00:36:48,103
I was gonna replace it
at the end of the day when I get my cut.

343
00:36:48,312 --> 00:36:51,231
I just didn't get to tell you.
She had no money to get home.

344
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,818
- Is this true?
- Yes.

345
00:36:54,985 --> 00:37:00,240
With all due respect, you don't want
your mistress traveling broke.

346
00:37:00,407 --> 00:37:04,828
She'd end up in a taxi
with no way to pay the cab fare.

347
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:08,707
Oh, you did this for me?

348
00:37:10,834 --> 00:37:12,836
Teodoro.

349
00:37:14,546 --> 00:37:18,717
The one who does
all the useful things for me. Huh?

350
00:37:18,884 --> 00:37:21,386
And now you do the thinking for me.

351
00:37:21,553 --> 00:37:23,847
No, no. It's not like that, patrón.

352
00:37:30,312 --> 00:37:33,565
Get a bucket. Wash my feet.

353
00:37:42,991 --> 00:37:45,202
So, what do we do now?

354
00:37:46,286 --> 00:37:49,957
- I don't know.
- I'm afraid that's not good enough.

355
00:37:50,165 --> 00:37:51,667
Just give me a moment to think.

356
00:37:51,833 --> 00:37:54,753
Wasting time is not an option.
I need to be out of here.

357
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:58,590
I know, in time for your fishing trip.
Or is it a bird-watching trip?

358
00:37:58,757 --> 00:38:00,926
That's my trip log, I've told you.

359
00:38:01,468 --> 00:38:05,806
I need to retrace my steps. I'm doing
everything. The same thing you are.

360
00:38:05,973 --> 00:38:07,766
Just leave me alone, please.

361
00:38:08,558 --> 00:38:12,813
Before I was arrested, a man
came to my flat and took my addresses.

362
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:16,441
They know the name of everyone
I care about and how to find them.

363
00:38:17,609 --> 00:38:21,405
They already found everyone
I care about, okay?

364
00:38:22,823 --> 00:38:25,200
If you can't get me out of here,
tell me now.

365
00:38:25,367 --> 00:38:27,077
Because time's running out.

366
00:38:27,995 --> 00:38:29,538
Huh?

367
00:38:47,556 --> 00:38:49,808
Look, it's hot today.

368
00:38:50,517 --> 00:38:54,896
Yeah.
Prefer the heat to the cold any day.

369
00:38:56,314 --> 00:38:59,192
My brother and I wanted
to come down here to Panama...

370
00:38:59,401 --> 00:39:02,237
...and start a dive shop,
like the one we were at today.

371
00:39:02,863 --> 00:39:07,367
My boy was gonna leave school
and help start the family business.

372
00:39:07,534 --> 00:39:09,995
When this is all over,
why don't you do it?

373
00:39:12,164 --> 00:39:14,207
Too much bad stuff's happened.

374
00:39:14,958 --> 00:39:16,710
Still, you can make it work.

375
00:39:16,877 --> 00:39:20,130
It's only gonna work
if Whistler cooperates.

376
00:39:20,297 --> 00:39:22,716
He plays games, people get hurt.

377
00:39:23,425 --> 00:39:28,722
- You understand that, right?
- He doesn't want anyone to get hurt.

378
00:39:29,765 --> 00:39:32,809
Hope you're right.
I wanna show you something.

379
00:39:42,486 --> 00:39:43,862
Our getaway vehicle.

380
00:39:45,489 --> 00:39:48,909
Now, the next time
you see Whistler...

381
00:39:49,868 --> 00:39:53,246
...I want you to tell him
what you saw.

382
00:39:53,413 --> 00:39:59,127
Tell him we're all in this together.
That we're part of a team, understand?

383
00:40:00,045 --> 00:40:02,255
- Okay, yeah.
- All right. Get up.

384
00:40:06,885 --> 00:40:10,555
We're coming back. This way.

385
00:40:11,807 --> 00:40:14,017
- What?
- This way, come on.

386
00:40:14,184 --> 00:40:15,685
Okay.

387
00:40:24,152 --> 00:40:27,906
If all goes well,
you'll see him tomorrow.

388
00:40:57,269 --> 00:40:58,520
No, no, no.

389
00:41:17,539 --> 00:41:19,124
Hmm?

390
00:41:32,512 --> 00:41:35,974
If we're gonna do this today,
we gotta replace everything we lost.

391
00:41:36,182 --> 00:41:38,184
- Like what?
- For starters, new exit point.

392
00:41:38,393 --> 00:41:40,812
It's gotta be
on the south side of the building.

393
00:41:41,021 --> 00:41:45,775
- Hey, this guy again.
- Hey, hey. I know you.

394
00:41:46,401 --> 00:41:48,236
- Afraid not.
- Yeah, yeah.

395
00:41:48,445 --> 00:41:51,573
You're McFadden, right?

396
00:41:52,157 --> 00:41:53,867
Nice, 1997.

397
00:41:54,034 --> 00:41:56,703
Sorry, you've confused me
with someone else.

398
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:59,622
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I swear.
You were with the ambassador.

399
00:42:01,875 --> 00:42:04,586
You've mistaken me for someone else.

400
00:42:17,891 --> 00:42:21,102
That chap's insane.
The heat must be getting to him.

401
00:42:23,772 --> 00:42:26,149
Come on, guys.
I got something to show you.

402
00:42:30,445 --> 00:42:33,782
I didn't observe the guards' behavior
in as much detail as you guys...

403
00:42:33,948 --> 00:42:37,494
...but I did notice something
yesterday.

404
00:42:38,411 --> 00:42:40,288
Right around this time.

405
00:42:43,166 --> 00:42:48,338
- It's the day shift. They start up at 6.
- Just keep looking. Keep looking.

406
00:42:51,299 --> 00:42:53,426
There.

407
00:43:01,309 --> 00:43:02,811
Where'd you get your cup, Alex?

408
00:43:02,977 --> 00:43:05,396
In the courtyard,
but apparently it's from him.

409
00:43:05,563 --> 00:43:08,358
He has one in the morning
and one after lunch.

410
00:43:08,525 --> 00:43:09,984
The man's gotta have his fix.

411
00:43:12,821 --> 00:43:15,198
- If we get to that cup--
- We get to the man.

412
00:43:17,784 --> 00:43:19,118
We gotta move.
