1
00:00:02,318 --> 00:00:04,112
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,822
I just wanna go.

3
00:00:07,573 --> 00:00:09,033
It's okay.

4
00:00:11,202 --> 00:00:15,248
What special talents do you have
that you are worth more alive than dead?

5
00:00:15,456 --> 00:00:16,666
Be careful, Alex.

6
00:00:23,297 --> 00:00:25,466
- Were you able to find my book?
- Yeah.

7
00:00:25,675 --> 00:00:28,177
But there was this guy. He took it.

8
00:00:28,386 --> 00:00:31,097
He said to tell you
that Scofield's brother has it now.

9
00:00:31,305 --> 00:00:34,684
- You'll have to bring them out.
- L.J.! Sara!

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,438
Never try anything like that again.

11
00:00:39,605 --> 00:00:42,525
But just to make sure,
I left you something in the garage.

12
00:01:19,645 --> 00:01:22,523
Yo, yo, yo,
check them out over there, dawg.

13
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:40,708
What's so interesting out there,
other than our freedom?

14
00:01:40,917 --> 00:01:43,836
The vine's alive, so the fence is dead.
No current.

15
00:01:44,045 --> 00:01:47,548
Everyone in here knows that fence
doesn't work. It doesn't mean a thing.

16
00:01:47,715 --> 00:01:50,343
Soldiers will shoot you
before you get within 30 yards.

17
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:53,554
Well, I guess I got a lot of work to do,
don't I?

18
00:01:53,763 --> 00:01:55,681
I get what you're doing with my book.

19
00:01:55,848 --> 00:01:59,727
They hold your friend, you hold what
they want. Counter needs, Churchill 101.

20
00:01:59,894 --> 00:02:02,855
They're gonna ask my progress
in figuring out what they want.

21
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:05,566
I'm gonna say,
"Nil. Lincoln Burrows has the book."

22
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:10,488
You know what? Threatening the brother
of who's supposed to get you out...

23
00:02:10,655 --> 00:02:13,491
- ...might not be the smartest move.
- I'm not threatening.

24
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:15,201
We play games with that book...

25
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:18,537
...the people who want me out
will take action against us all.

26
00:02:18,746 --> 00:02:21,415
"I never worry about action,
only inaction."

27
00:02:21,624 --> 00:02:22,833
Churchill 101.

28
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:25,878
Now, like I said,
I got a lot of work to do.

29
00:02:56,659 --> 00:03:00,079
- Linc, you all right?
- I'm sorry, man.

30
00:03:00,287 --> 00:03:04,291
It's just all this stuff,
it's starting to get to me, you know?

31
00:03:07,545 --> 00:03:10,172
Listen, our situation could change
very, very soon.

32
00:03:10,381 --> 00:03:13,384
The gravedigger for the prison,
I need you to reach out to him.

33
00:03:13,592 --> 00:03:16,137
- Tell him what?
- It's all written down.

34
00:03:16,345 --> 00:03:18,639
But we gotta get started now.

35
00:03:21,517 --> 00:03:23,727
What are you not telling me?

36
00:03:24,061 --> 00:03:26,897
All these people that have been hurt
because of me...

37
00:03:27,064 --> 00:03:28,941
...you know, it's...

38
00:03:30,234 --> 00:03:33,279
- I'm so sorry, Michael.
- They did this, not you.

39
00:03:33,487 --> 00:03:35,990
Okay? It's not your fault.

40
00:03:37,032 --> 00:03:39,493
Just get to the gravedigger.

41
00:03:39,743 --> 00:03:41,579
I feel like we're running out of time.

42
00:04:22,453 --> 00:04:24,288
Sara.

43
00:05:25,182 --> 00:05:27,976
I am just a soldier in this war,
Lincoln...

44
00:05:28,143 --> 00:05:30,145
...just like you.

45
00:05:30,354 --> 00:05:33,440
I did not want to do that.

46
00:05:34,066 --> 00:05:36,777
Can you even comprehend
the intimacy of the mechanics...

47
00:05:36,944 --> 00:05:39,530
...of what I had to do to that woman?

48
00:05:39,697 --> 00:05:41,907
It's horrible.

49
00:05:42,574 --> 00:05:46,453
Now, if you and your brother
are done playing games, L.J. will be fine.

50
00:05:46,662 --> 00:05:50,499
If not, the last thing I wanna do
is start mailing pieces of him to you.

51
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,501
But if you push me...

52
00:05:52,668 --> 00:05:56,088
...and not even that far, I will.

53
00:05:57,756 --> 00:06:00,759
I'll do anything you want.
Just don't hurt my son.

54
00:06:01,468 --> 00:06:02,886
It's really up to you.

55
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:08,892
I know the past few days
have been hard, for me as well.

56
00:06:09,518 --> 00:06:12,855
If you wanna talk about it,
I know what this pain feels like.

57
00:06:13,522 --> 00:06:16,984
I just wanna get your boy out of Sona
and get my son back.

58
00:06:17,776 --> 00:06:20,028
- Michael's got a plan.
- I need details.

59
00:06:20,195 --> 00:06:23,198
We need to bring someone
who works at the prison onto the team.

60
00:06:23,365 --> 00:06:25,242
- Who?
- The gravedigger.

61
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:27,661
Get it done.

62
00:06:30,038 --> 00:06:32,624
Lincoln, I'm gonna need that book.

63
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:36,170
The Company did handwriting analysis
on the one you gave me...

64
00:06:36,378 --> 00:06:39,256
...and yours hasn't changed
since high school.

65
00:06:48,557 --> 00:06:52,644
Just soldiers, Linc. Different armies,
but soldiers just the same.

66
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:12,206
Nice.

67
00:07:13,081 --> 00:07:16,335
- I was best in my school.
- All girls?

68
00:07:16,501 --> 00:07:18,003
Kiss my ass, bro.

69
00:07:19,588 --> 00:07:21,673
Twenty bucks says
you can't do that again.

70
00:07:21,882 --> 00:07:23,634
- Bet.
- Wait.

71
00:07:24,676 --> 00:07:27,971
- Adjust for wind.
- Shut up.

72
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,850
It's just a bit outside.

73
00:07:33,268 --> 00:07:36,563
Hey, bro, you know I don't have
that kind of verde lying around.

74
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:40,275
- It's gonna take a while.
- The thing is I don't have a while.

75
00:07:40,484 --> 00:07:42,402
- So unless you want--
- No more favors.

76
00:07:43,153 --> 00:07:45,822
All right. Then I'll borrow
that cross of yours.

77
00:07:45,989 --> 00:07:49,910
- I'll take it in trade.
- My dad gave me this.

78
00:07:50,077 --> 00:07:53,497
- Besides, it's not even real gold.
- That's why I need it.

79
00:07:54,081 --> 00:07:56,917
Look, I'll give it back, okay?
It's just a loan.

80
00:07:58,502 --> 00:08:00,420
Come on, I've gotta go.

81
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:10,138
This time, I wanna know why.

82
00:08:21,233 --> 00:08:23,235
It's light again.

83
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:26,571
Somebody getting fat off
everything I built, while I rot in here.

84
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:33,203
Don't get upset, patrón. I only have
a few more hours. Let's be nice.

85
00:08:51,805 --> 00:08:54,433
This motherless bitch.

86
00:09:25,213 --> 00:09:26,756
Alex.

87
00:09:30,635 --> 00:09:32,262
- You just get here?
- Yes.

88
00:09:35,682 --> 00:09:39,186
Listen, I've been thinking about
our little talk...

89
00:09:40,187 --> 00:09:41,771
...and you're in.

90
00:09:42,022 --> 00:09:43,815
I'm in. Okay.

91
00:09:44,024 --> 00:09:45,609
- Just like that?
- I really--

92
00:09:45,775 --> 00:09:48,612
I really don't have a choice, do I?

93
00:09:48,945 --> 00:09:51,198
- What's the plan?
- I'm working on it.

94
00:09:51,364 --> 00:09:53,200
Meanwhile, I could use your help.

95
00:09:53,408 --> 00:09:55,702
- What do you need?
- A black felt-tipped pen.

96
00:09:55,911 --> 00:09:57,454
- A pen?
- Yeah.

97
00:09:57,662 --> 00:10:00,373
- Why?
- Some documents that need altering.

98
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:04,377
I'll explain it to you later.
Right now, I need that pen, okay?

99
00:10:04,544 --> 00:10:05,754
Yeah.

100
00:10:05,962 --> 00:10:09,257
I'll tell you what else I need.
I need you to get your act together.

101
00:10:09,424 --> 00:10:12,594
Bring yourself under control,
because you're attracting attention.

102
00:10:12,761 --> 00:10:14,846
And that we don't need.

103
00:10:15,013 --> 00:10:18,683
- I'm under control.
- Of course you are.

104
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,694
This is what happens
when the system is overloaded.

105
00:10:30,946 --> 00:10:32,447
See? Look.

106
00:10:33,949 --> 00:10:36,534
- Son of a--
- Power is out.

107
00:10:37,285 --> 00:10:40,121
- Fix it.
- I'm a truck driver.

108
00:10:47,003 --> 00:10:48,922
Hey, Alex.

109
00:10:50,465 --> 00:10:53,093
Glad I found you.
Wanted to see how you're holding up.

110
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,594
Just dandy.

111
00:10:54,803 --> 00:10:58,223
I've been having a tough time of it.
It shouldn't be that way for us...

112
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:01,101
...seeing as how we're the only lawmen
here in Taco Hell.

113
00:11:01,309 --> 00:11:03,186
Hey, whoa.
Wait on a second there, Alex.

114
00:11:03,353 --> 00:11:06,731
You and me, we were a team
on the outside. I was your dawg.

115
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,359
- I still got a lot of bark left--
- I'm busy, Brad.

116
00:11:09,567 --> 00:11:11,403
- What do you want?
- You and Scofield.

117
00:11:11,569 --> 00:11:14,614
You're up to something.
You can tell me, one badge to another.

118
00:11:14,781 --> 00:11:17,909
- I can help.
- Do you have a black felt-tipped pen?

119
00:11:19,327 --> 00:11:22,288
- Not on me.
- Then you can't help me.

120
00:11:40,181 --> 00:11:43,101
- I know.
- You know what?

121
00:11:43,309 --> 00:11:46,688
I know you're trying to escape from here
with that man Scofield.

122
00:11:46,855 --> 00:11:48,690
- Sweetheart--
- Please, don't lie to me.

123
00:11:48,857 --> 00:11:50,817
Lincoln Burrows,
he told me everything.

124
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,615
There are some very powerful people
that want me out of here.

125
00:11:57,824 --> 00:12:00,160
- They want the brothers to get me out.
- Why?

126
00:12:00,368 --> 00:12:03,705
I'm not sure. It has something to do
with a charter I did in Seattle.

127
00:12:03,872 --> 00:12:06,374
What I do know is, their endgame
is the same as ours.

128
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,668
And that's me out of this hellhole.

129
00:12:08,835 --> 00:12:12,213
Once that happens,
you and I will disappear forever.

130
00:12:12,422 --> 00:12:15,133
- I don't wanna involve you in this mess.
- I want to help.

131
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,594
- It's too dangerous.
- I'm not asking permission.

132
00:12:17,761 --> 00:12:20,472
I'm telling you.
I can't do this on my own.

133
00:12:20,638 --> 00:12:24,684
If you can tell me what you know,
we can work it through together.

134
00:12:26,102 --> 00:12:28,354
I don't understand everything
that's going on.

135
00:12:28,563 --> 00:12:30,940
They're trying to find out
what they can about me.

136
00:12:31,107 --> 00:12:33,109
Let's see what we can discover
about them.

137
00:12:33,276 --> 00:12:36,112
- Find what their plan is.
- They're trying to get you out...

138
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:39,282
- ...and you don't trust them?
- I don't trust any of these guys.

139
00:12:39,449 --> 00:12:41,493
And you shouldn't either.

140
00:12:41,659 --> 00:12:44,662
If you insist on getting into this,
promise you'll be careful.

141
00:12:44,871 --> 00:12:48,500
Because God knows,
I will die if anything happens to you.

142
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:52,545
Hey.

143
00:13:11,022 --> 00:13:12,690
Michael.

144
00:13:15,318 --> 00:13:16,903
Here.

145
00:13:17,737 --> 00:13:20,990
I said I needed a black felt-tipped pen.

146
00:13:24,619 --> 00:13:26,913
- It's black.
- It's not what I need.

147
00:13:28,373 --> 00:13:30,375
Keep looking.

148
00:13:33,544 --> 00:13:35,380
He's playing me.

149
00:13:36,714 --> 00:13:38,091
He's playing you.

150
00:13:38,299 --> 00:13:41,135
Do not trust him.

151
00:13:53,356 --> 00:13:55,775
Your amigo, the American...

152
00:13:56,818 --> 00:13:59,237
...he's a builder, an engineer, no?

153
00:13:59,404 --> 00:14:01,155
No amigo of mine, boss.

154
00:14:01,322 --> 00:14:03,783
Trust me, you do not wanna get
under the covers--

155
00:14:03,992 --> 00:14:05,618
Is he or is he not an engineer?

156
00:14:05,827 --> 00:14:07,996
Well, yeah, but--

157
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,709
Scofield.

158
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:18,589
- What do you know about electricity?
- Only that we don't have any right now.

159
00:14:18,756 --> 00:14:20,049
Let me tell you something.

160
00:14:20,216 --> 00:14:23,094
This phone keeps all the food
coming to the gate...

161
00:14:23,261 --> 00:14:25,346
...keeps my business running,
Sona running.

162
00:14:25,513 --> 00:14:27,724
Electricity die, phone die.
Phone die, we die.

163
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:30,184
We die or you die?

164
00:14:30,351 --> 00:14:33,146
Boy, you have enough education
but you're not being smart.

165
00:14:33,312 --> 00:14:35,815
Now, I come to you,
that is an opportunity.

166
00:14:36,024 --> 00:14:37,900
Be wise and take advantage.

167
00:14:38,109 --> 00:14:41,696
Now, can you fix the electricity
just like you fixed the water?

168
00:14:41,904 --> 00:14:45,241
It's not that simple.
The water pipes are inside the prison.

169
00:14:45,408 --> 00:14:49,579
The electrical lines are probably running
underground along an exterior wall.

170
00:14:49,746 --> 00:14:53,666
Which means they're out there
somewhere in no man's land.

171
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:56,919
- So you can fix the power?
- Last I checked...

172
00:14:57,086 --> 00:15:00,715
...they shoot prisoners who go out there,
so I'm thinking the answer is no.

173
00:15:02,675 --> 00:15:06,220
Now, you listen to me.
And you listen closely, water boy.

174
00:15:06,429 --> 00:15:09,057
Like it or not, soldiers or not...

175
00:15:09,223 --> 00:15:12,643
...you're going out into no man's land.

176
00:15:19,233 --> 00:15:22,195
- It's a suicide mission.
- I'll make some calls.

177
00:15:22,403 --> 00:15:24,447
- You're gonna keep me safe?
- As best I can.

178
00:15:24,614 --> 00:15:27,116
- I don't think I can do this.
- No, no, no.

179
00:15:27,283 --> 00:15:30,286
You will help me with this.
Look, I will do something for you.

180
00:15:30,495 --> 00:15:32,830
I get you a new pillow.
Goose feather, like mine.

181
00:15:32,997 --> 00:15:34,832
Or a small TV.

182
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,043
All right.

183
00:15:37,251 --> 00:15:39,045
Get me that.

184
00:15:40,546 --> 00:15:43,508
- Why?
- It's the first to get sun in the morning.

185
00:15:43,716 --> 00:15:46,260
You get me that cell,
I'll get you electricity.

186
00:15:59,732 --> 00:16:01,818
Hey, Linc.

187
00:16:11,744 --> 00:16:14,747
Look, bro, I'm gonna be out of your way
real soon.

188
00:16:14,956 --> 00:16:17,416
I saw these fliers for migrant workers
in Colombia.

189
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:20,211
Coffee bean season.
They're letting Panamanians in.

190
00:16:20,378 --> 00:16:24,131
So I figure with a good ID,
I could pass.

191
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:27,093
- Bus leaves today, okay?
- All right.

192
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,928
Before you get out of here, man...

193
00:16:29,095 --> 00:16:32,056
...I'm meeting someone
and I need a translator.

194
00:16:32,223 --> 00:16:34,308
Linc, I appreciate everything
you've done--

195
00:16:34,475 --> 00:16:37,562
Just be a couple of hours.
Just be a couple of hours, that's it.

196
00:16:37,728 --> 00:16:42,066
When I was 15, my cousin told me about
a job that only lasts a few hours.

197
00:16:42,233 --> 00:16:44,819
- And I got three months.
- I can't do this without you.

198
00:16:44,986 --> 00:16:47,655
- I'm in Panama, I don't speak--
- I can't miss that bus.

199
00:16:47,863 --> 00:16:50,032
I'm gonna make money
and send it home.

200
00:16:50,241 --> 00:16:53,452
On the run or not, I'm gonna be a dad.
You, of all people, should understand--

201
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,512
I spoke to James.

202
00:17:12,221 --> 00:17:15,433
He confirmed what you told me
about the escape.

203
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:20,646
You and I, we both have people in there
we care about.

204
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:25,234
Please, let me help you.

205
00:17:26,902 --> 00:17:29,447
Your Spanish as good as your English?

206
00:17:31,407 --> 00:17:34,243
Yes, colonel.
I just have one favor to ask.

207
00:17:34,452 --> 00:17:35,911
Just outside of the gate.

208
00:17:36,454 --> 00:17:38,539
Well, you can bring your men.

209
00:17:39,915 --> 00:17:42,335
The phone is dying.

210
00:17:45,463 --> 00:17:47,381
Make him one.

211
00:17:58,267 --> 00:17:59,935
This is it?

212
00:18:00,144 --> 00:18:03,898
Not everyone has it yet. We let credit
go a week and there is still time.

213
00:18:04,774 --> 00:18:07,276
- It's in your veins, adicto.
- No, patrón.

214
00:18:07,443 --> 00:18:11,614
No, patrón. I don't use anymore,
I swear to you. I swear to you.

215
00:18:11,781 --> 00:18:14,200
I swear to you. I swear to you.

216
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:24,835
Chin up, pal of mine, chin up.

217
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:32,843
Sí, colonel.

218
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:36,514
Yes, thank you, colonel.
We'll be right there.

219
00:18:36,722 --> 00:18:38,265
Come with me.

220
00:18:42,311 --> 00:18:43,646
Excuse me, do you...?

221
00:18:44,605 --> 00:18:47,066
Do you have a pen?

222
00:18:47,274 --> 00:18:50,319
Pen, pen. Not the brush.

223
00:18:50,528 --> 00:18:53,113
- With the pen. Pen, pen.
- No, no, pintura.

224
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,407
The pintura, yeah.

225
00:19:11,423 --> 00:19:12,716
He's leaving you.

226
00:19:12,883 --> 00:19:14,635
He's leaving you. He'll be gone...

227
00:19:14,844 --> 00:19:18,472
...and you'll be stuck
in this maze forever.

228
00:19:23,978 --> 00:19:26,146
Thank you for arranging this
for us, colonel.

229
00:19:26,355 --> 00:19:28,857
I am getting something out of this,
I assure you.

230
00:19:29,024 --> 00:19:32,069
You know you can fix
this electric problem?

231
00:19:32,528 --> 00:19:37,658
I won't know for sure until we can start
digging, but, yes, I think so.

232
00:19:37,825 --> 00:19:39,702
My men will shoot you in the head...

233
00:19:39,868 --> 00:19:42,580
...if you so much as look
at the fence, huh?

234
00:19:42,746 --> 00:19:44,164
And you, patrón...

235
00:19:44,331 --> 00:19:47,835
...if anything goes wrong,
it will not only be his life that is lost.

236
00:19:48,043 --> 00:19:51,839
- You have my word on that.
- It's no worries, colonel.

237
00:19:52,047 --> 00:19:54,592
I'll keep this boy in line.

238
00:19:58,053 --> 00:20:00,180
- I'll dig.
- I don't need your help.

239
00:20:00,347 --> 00:20:02,016
Hey, come on, man, don't be proud.

240
00:20:02,182 --> 00:20:05,185
I heard you talking just yesterday,
talking to Mahone.

241
00:20:05,394 --> 00:20:08,022
You know, about how us Americans
should stick together.

242
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:11,317
So I help you now and I'm sure
you'll help me down the road.

243
00:20:11,483 --> 00:20:12,651
Right, Mikey?

244
00:20:18,615 --> 00:20:21,368
What is it, a '66 or a '67?

245
00:20:22,745 --> 00:20:23,954
The car.

246
00:20:31,045 --> 00:20:34,965
- Sixty-six.
- What is it, 325 horses?

247
00:20:38,761 --> 00:20:41,180
Three-seven-five.

248
00:20:46,894 --> 00:20:48,645
- What's he saying?
- He recognizes me.

249
00:20:48,854 --> 00:20:51,732
- He doesn't realize it was at prison.
- Does he want cash...

250
00:20:51,899 --> 00:20:53,734
...to get this car cherry
by next week?

251
00:21:02,451 --> 00:21:05,120
He knows we're not talking
about cars.

252
00:21:05,287 --> 00:21:07,039
That's right.

253
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:12,002
I know you're getting out of here.
I heard about you and the limey.

254
00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:16,006
- I'm just fixing the electricity.
- And I'm just single because I'm choosy.

255
00:21:16,548 --> 00:21:19,802
- Don't make me tell what I know.
- What is it you think you know?

256
00:21:19,968 --> 00:21:23,555
Something called the Company wanted
you in here with Whistler. Am I warm?

257
00:21:23,722 --> 00:21:26,225
What's the Company?
What do they want with Whistler?

258
00:21:26,391 --> 00:21:28,435
I don't know, but you do.

259
00:21:28,769 --> 00:21:30,437
Doesn't sound like you know much.

260
00:21:30,604 --> 00:21:34,525
I don't need to know how to change
a diaper to know when it stinks.

261
00:21:34,691 --> 00:21:38,695
- You're doing something here, Scofield.
- You're right, I am.

262
00:21:38,862 --> 00:21:40,989
I'm fixing the electricity.

263
00:21:41,156 --> 00:21:43,492
You wanted to help dig? Dig.

264
00:22:07,057 --> 00:22:10,435
Hey. This is it.

265
00:22:24,825 --> 00:22:26,827
We're doing more
than playing electrician.

266
00:22:26,994 --> 00:22:31,081
Don't worry.
We're exactly where we need to be.

267
00:22:48,015 --> 00:22:52,060
Heat's getting to me, Scofield.
It's quitting time.

268
00:22:59,526 --> 00:23:01,987
You mind telling me
why he's even out here with us?

269
00:23:02,195 --> 00:23:04,072
He knows something's up.

270
00:23:04,281 --> 00:23:07,743
- How the hell does he know that?
- Let's just say I have a bit of a rep.

271
00:23:07,951 --> 00:23:09,911
From Fox River?

272
00:23:13,248 --> 00:23:16,501
I know who you are, mate.
Figured it out just lately.

273
00:23:17,294 --> 00:23:20,839
Finally made sense why they'd pick you,
of all people, to send here.

274
00:23:21,048 --> 00:23:22,758
No worries.

275
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,552
It's in my interest
to keep your little secret.

276
00:23:25,719 --> 00:23:28,972
But Bellick? He can't be trusted.

277
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,434
I can handle Bellick.
He's not in on this.

278
00:23:33,143 --> 00:23:36,313
- Okay, good.
- But Mahone is.

279
00:23:37,272 --> 00:23:40,650
Mahone? He's looking about as stable
as a three-legged chair...

280
00:23:40,817 --> 00:23:44,154
- ...and he's escaping with us?
- No, he just thinks he is.

281
00:23:44,321 --> 00:23:48,033
He needs his meds. Without them,
he'll self-destruct.

282
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,535
It's just a matter of time.

283
00:23:51,787 --> 00:23:53,080
And if he doesn't?

284
00:23:53,246 --> 00:23:56,291
I'll string him along,
tell him what he wants to hear.

285
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:58,877
Then I'll cut him loose.

286
00:23:59,711 --> 00:24:02,631
How do I know you're not gonna do
the same thing to me?

287
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:04,716
You don't.

288
00:24:19,064 --> 00:24:21,483
You need a hookup, my friend?

289
00:24:24,653 --> 00:24:26,488
- No.
- Take your time.

290
00:24:26,655 --> 00:24:30,450
I don't hard sell.
My product speaks for itself.

291
00:24:30,617 --> 00:24:33,787
Outside, I took something.

292
00:24:33,954 --> 00:24:38,667
This prescription drug
called Veratril.

293
00:24:38,834 --> 00:24:42,045
And I was wondering if you...

294
00:24:42,254 --> 00:24:46,133
This ain't no farmacia.
But what I got right here...

295
00:24:46,299 --> 00:24:49,636
...is better than anything your doctor
gave you back in the States.

296
00:24:49,845 --> 00:24:52,264
- That's tar.
- Just take a taste.

297
00:24:53,682 --> 00:24:55,934
You know, keep it in check.

298
00:24:56,101 --> 00:24:57,894
I don't have any money right now.

299
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,647
Then I don't have any drugs.

300
00:25:00,856 --> 00:25:03,108
But there are a few ways for a man...

301
00:25:03,275 --> 00:25:05,986
...to make a few dollars,
servicing the needs of others.

302
00:25:06,153 --> 00:25:09,239
- Not something I'm into but--
- You think I'm a punk?

303
00:25:12,742 --> 00:25:16,913
I'm just helping you get well, my friend.
Just helping you get well.

304
00:25:24,754 --> 00:25:26,214
Señor Luchero.

305
00:25:27,424 --> 00:25:28,466
Señor Luchero.

306
00:25:29,843 --> 00:25:31,803
- What do you want?
- I know you're busy...

307
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:35,765
...but I wanted to tell you,
Michael Scofield's taking you for a ride.

308
00:25:35,932 --> 00:25:38,101
No, cerdo, I don't think so.

309
00:25:38,268 --> 00:25:41,771
I heard him talking about escape
yesterday, about breaking out of here.

310
00:25:41,938 --> 00:25:46,359
If he's talking about escape, why are you
here and you're not going with him, eh?

311
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:49,863
I would if he'd let me
but he's cut me out.

312
00:25:50,071 --> 00:25:52,741
He says he's square,
but I know he's up to something.

313
00:25:52,949 --> 00:25:56,786
So I figured, I might as well tell you,
and make my time in here a bit easier.

314
00:25:56,953 --> 00:25:59,623
Every man fantasizes
about escaping from Sona.

315
00:25:59,831 --> 00:26:02,500
Yeah, but they aren't all
in no man's land with shovels.

316
00:26:02,709 --> 00:26:04,794
I gave him the shovels. Get him out.

317
00:26:05,003 --> 00:26:07,255
I gave him shovels too,
and guys to work with.

318
00:26:07,464 --> 00:26:10,091
I worked in the prison he broke out of.

319
00:26:12,969 --> 00:26:17,015
He said he was doing me a favor,
fixing damage from a fire he started.

320
00:26:17,182 --> 00:26:21,728
And you know what I got? Hogtied
and left in a pipe under my own prison.

321
00:26:23,772 --> 00:26:27,192
There's nothing he can do.
The soldiers are watching him.

322
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:30,904
That's what I thought, until he tunneled
out of my guard's room.

323
00:26:31,071 --> 00:26:33,782
He's buried something
in the junction box and covered it.

324
00:26:33,948 --> 00:26:36,284
I saw him. Go see for yourself.

325
00:26:36,493 --> 00:26:38,662
If I'm lying, I'm dying.

326
00:26:42,499 --> 00:26:45,627
Trouble keeps finding you here
in Sona, doesn't it?

327
00:26:46,795 --> 00:26:48,713
Take a walk, eh?

328
00:26:54,302 --> 00:26:56,596
There are rumors
that you're trying to trick me.

329
00:26:56,805 --> 00:26:59,140
I'm just doing what I'm told.

330
00:26:59,307 --> 00:27:02,310
Well, let's hope for your sake
that's true.

331
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:04,020
But just to make sure...

332
00:27:04,187 --> 00:27:08,733
...let's go on out to no man's land
and see what you buried there.

333
00:27:19,369 --> 00:27:22,580
I just wanna make sure my men
are doing a good job for the colonel.

334
00:27:22,747 --> 00:27:24,499
Get in there.

335
00:27:25,458 --> 00:27:27,502
Get in there.

336
00:27:33,007 --> 00:27:34,801
Open it.

337
00:27:42,142 --> 00:27:45,353
Move the dirt. Now.

338
00:27:50,775 --> 00:27:56,281
It's duct tape to fix the frayed wires.
It's why the power was so inconsistent.

339
00:27:56,447 --> 00:28:01,828
I didn't want the tape to come loose,
so I packed it down with dirt.

340
00:28:05,665 --> 00:28:07,500
Beautiful.

341
00:28:08,459 --> 00:28:09,961
Where you going?

342
00:28:10,128 --> 00:28:12,297
I gotta turn the main power switch
back on.

343
00:28:12,505 --> 00:28:15,425
I had to turn it off
so we could work on the wires safely.

344
00:28:15,633 --> 00:28:17,677
- I'll come with you.
- It's just a switch.

345
00:28:17,844 --> 00:28:21,556
- I can handle it myself.
- Yeah, you can, but you won't.

346
00:28:32,483 --> 00:28:34,360
Water boy, it's back here.

347
00:28:39,032 --> 00:28:42,744
Don't need the chain, just the cross.
It's the perfect size. It's not gold...

348
00:28:42,911 --> 00:28:45,079
...so it won't conduct current.

349
00:28:48,416 --> 00:28:52,170
Keep the circuit open, no power,
even when the main switch is turned on.

350
00:28:52,378 --> 00:28:56,549
Take the cross out,
Sona lights up again.

351
00:28:56,758 --> 00:29:00,637
Lechero find out you mess
with his electric, you're dead.

352
00:29:00,845 --> 00:29:02,847
That's why he can't ever find out.

353
00:29:06,017 --> 00:29:08,311
Now, don't make me come get you.

354
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:11,272
Nobody back there can help you.

355
00:29:24,994 --> 00:29:27,705
It's some kind of mistake.

356
00:29:28,581 --> 00:29:31,751
- It should be working.
- Only mistake I made was trusting you.

357
00:29:31,918 --> 00:29:33,711
Sammy.

358
00:29:54,023 --> 00:29:57,068
Transformer delay. It's an old prison.

359
00:29:57,276 --> 00:30:02,365
Now, if you don't mind,
I'd like to move into my new cell.

360
00:30:04,701 --> 00:30:06,577
Thank you for your words before,
blanco.

361
00:30:06,786 --> 00:30:09,330
Working for Lechero...

362
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:11,541
...not an easy field to plow,
comprende?

363
00:30:11,708 --> 00:30:14,293
Oh, yeah, yeah, I comprende.

364
00:30:14,502 --> 00:30:17,255
But you and me,
we're amigos, Nieves.

365
00:30:18,172 --> 00:30:20,883
When Lechero's in a better mood,
I put in a good word.

366
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:24,887
Help you-- How you say?
--move up the ladder.

367
00:30:25,054 --> 00:30:30,476
Oh, I appreciate it, compadre,
but I was always taught...

368
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:34,730
...that God helps those
that help themselves.

369
00:31:03,593 --> 00:31:05,428
- Fifteen thousand.
- Why?

370
00:31:05,595 --> 00:31:07,180
Because that's what he wanted.

371
00:31:07,346 --> 00:31:10,349
Relax, I'll get you the money.

372
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:12,477
- And I will meet you there.
- Okay.

373
00:31:12,685 --> 00:31:13,978
How you holding up?

374
00:31:14,812 --> 00:31:17,857
- I just wanna get this done.
- Good.

375
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,153
Stay here.

376
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,030
- I'm coming with you.
- Stay here.

377
00:31:24,238 --> 00:31:26,866
- Do you expect me to stay and wait?
- I don't care.

378
00:31:27,074 --> 00:31:30,870
You don't care? Who the hell
are you to say you don't care?

379
00:31:31,204 --> 00:31:34,207
- You're not the only one affected.
- I know, that's the problem.

380
00:31:34,373 --> 00:31:38,169
And you will run and do what you want?
What kind of a man are you that just--?

381
00:31:38,336 --> 00:31:42,882
They killed Sara and put her head
in a box. And they've got my son.

382
00:31:53,226 --> 00:31:56,020
Oh, Linc, I'm sorry.

383
00:31:56,229 --> 00:31:58,022
You still here?

384
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:17,500
- Hey, Lechero wants to talk to you.
- I was just about to get a little trim.

385
00:32:17,708 --> 00:32:21,420
- Lechero said I was looking all bootoo.
- It'll wait.

386
00:32:26,509 --> 00:32:27,677
Did you know about this?

387
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:34,475
- Did you know anything about this?
- Me? No, no.

388
00:32:34,642 --> 00:32:36,811
Nieves...

389
00:32:36,978 --> 00:32:38,437
Nieves, we was friends, man.

390
00:32:38,646 --> 00:32:40,106
That's right.

391
00:32:41,023 --> 00:32:45,569
Now, if you knew that he was using
and didn't tell me...

392
00:32:45,736 --> 00:32:47,905
...his death is on your head.

393
00:32:49,365 --> 00:32:52,910
Patrón, patrón, patrón.
I don't know nothing about drugs.

394
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:54,954
I don't.

395
00:32:55,538 --> 00:32:59,041
I mean, I tried me some reefer
when I was 12.

396
00:32:59,208 --> 00:33:01,752
I almost coughed up a lung.

397
00:33:10,594 --> 00:33:12,346
Good.

398
00:33:12,555 --> 00:33:16,934
That's good, Teodoro.

399
00:33:22,356 --> 00:33:24,817
There appears to be an opening
on my crew.

400
00:33:34,535 --> 00:33:40,708
McGrady, here's your cross back
and thank you.

401
00:33:40,916 --> 00:33:43,377
You're a real smart guy.

402
00:33:43,586 --> 00:33:46,213
What the hell are you doing in prison?

403
00:33:49,967 --> 00:33:51,760
Here.

404
00:33:55,264 --> 00:33:58,642
That's perfect. How'd you get it?

405
00:33:58,809 --> 00:34:02,688
- It's what you wanted, right?
- Yeah.

406
00:34:02,897 --> 00:34:05,065
- Good work.
- So, what's the next step?

407
00:34:06,108 --> 00:34:10,529
We wait and I'll keep you posted.

408
00:34:14,241 --> 00:34:16,911
You know what you need to do.

409
00:34:25,586 --> 00:34:27,505
What do you think?

410
00:34:29,048 --> 00:34:31,258
I know you fixed the electricity
for a reason.

411
00:34:31,425 --> 00:34:33,886
But it can't have been
to make that fence sizzle.

412
00:34:34,094 --> 00:34:35,971
Unless you wanna
make the colonel happy.

413
00:34:36,138 --> 00:34:40,100
It's in both of our best interests to make
that fence as deadly as possible.

414
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:45,105
All we gotta do is wait for my brother
to come through with the gravedigger.

415
00:35:03,165 --> 00:35:05,125
He wants more.

416
00:35:05,751 --> 00:35:07,253
You said 15,000.

417
00:35:08,921 --> 00:35:10,297
You said 15,000.

418
00:35:11,674 --> 00:35:15,219
- You said 15,000! You said 15,000!
- Lincoln, I got it.

419
00:35:24,186 --> 00:35:26,105
No, no, no.

420
00:35:29,066 --> 00:35:31,026
What the hell are you doing?
We need him.

421
00:35:31,193 --> 00:35:36,031
He will sell us out to the cops after
he takes as much as he can from us.

422
00:35:36,198 --> 00:35:38,242
- No.
- No!

423
00:35:49,211 --> 00:35:51,672
He's packing up to go.

424
00:35:54,258 --> 00:35:55,718
Kill him.

425
00:35:55,884 --> 00:35:58,178
He's gonna betray you. Kill him.

426
00:36:01,515 --> 00:36:03,225
Good news, Agent Mahone.

427
00:36:03,392 --> 00:36:05,769
Due to the untimely demise
of Señor Juan Nieves...

428
00:36:05,936 --> 00:36:08,939
...I have now been promoted
manager in charge...

429
00:36:09,106 --> 00:36:12,526
...of retail distribution
and customer liaison.

430
00:36:12,693 --> 00:36:15,237
- Get away from me.
- All in due time.

431
00:36:16,196 --> 00:36:19,199
Now, I'm not you mama,
and I ain't one to wipe others' noses...

432
00:36:19,366 --> 00:36:22,786
...but let's just say
you've looked better.

433
00:36:22,953 --> 00:36:24,538
I want nothing from you.

434
00:36:25,164 --> 00:36:27,541
But sure seems you need something.

435
00:36:32,379 --> 00:36:37,050
On the arm, no strings attached.

436
00:36:41,972 --> 00:36:44,475
Get your head straight, Alex.

437
00:37:06,413 --> 00:37:10,167
Come on in, now.
Come watch the match, come.

438
00:37:10,751 --> 00:37:13,504
Oh, yeah, you guys call this football
down here, right?

439
00:37:13,712 --> 00:37:16,423
Very good, very good. It's World Cup.

440
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:19,176
Football without the silly hats
you wear in America.

441
00:37:19,384 --> 00:37:23,305
They all jump on top of each other
like a bunch of batty boys.

442
00:37:23,472 --> 00:37:25,224
Have a seat. Come.

443
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:27,226
Teodoro...

444
00:37:27,976 --> 00:37:29,436
Café

445
00:37:35,067 --> 00:37:39,780
The only thing I hate more than a rat
is a rat with bad information.

446
00:37:39,988 --> 00:37:43,158
Yeah, look, I'm sorry about all that,
but my information was good.

447
00:37:43,325 --> 00:37:45,619
It's just that Scofield's
a tricky bastard.

448
00:37:45,827 --> 00:37:47,913
He'll try something again, you'll see.

449
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:52,668
Why--? Wait a minute.
Come on, what are you doing to me?

450
00:37:52,834 --> 00:37:55,337
Come on, I gave you good information.

451
00:37:55,546 --> 00:37:57,923
Scofield's planning to escape.
I'm telling you.

452
00:37:58,131 --> 00:38:02,427
He's a sly bastard. Come on, guys.
Come on, what are you doing?

453
00:38:02,594 --> 00:38:04,888
Don't do this to me.
What are you doing?

454
00:38:05,097 --> 00:38:07,724
- Don't-- Look...
- Shh, shh, shh.

455
00:38:07,891 --> 00:38:10,269
I gave you good information.

456
00:38:10,602 --> 00:38:14,856
You say something this morning about,
"If I'm lying, I'm dying."

457
00:38:15,065 --> 00:38:16,942
Be thankful I don't hold you to that.

458
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:20,779
Come on, Bagwell, help me here, man.
Come on, Bagwell.

459
00:39:32,309 --> 00:39:35,270
You left this in your old cell.

460
00:39:37,981 --> 00:39:40,358
- Thanks, Alex.
- You're welcome.

461
00:39:40,567 --> 00:39:44,821
It's funny that you could forget
something as important as this is.

462
00:39:46,156 --> 00:39:48,575
Well, I'm glad you found it for me.

463
00:39:49,451 --> 00:39:51,328
Yeah.

464
00:39:52,245 --> 00:39:54,998
Oh, oh, look.

465
00:40:06,051 --> 00:40:08,845
You are breathing
only by my grace, Michael.

466
00:40:09,054 --> 00:40:12,182
Now, you remember the next time
that you're gonna send me...

467
00:40:12,349 --> 00:40:14,601
- ...on a goose chase, okay?
- I didn't mean to--

468
00:40:14,768 --> 00:40:18,522
No, no, you did.
You think you can manipulate me...

469
00:40:19,731 --> 00:40:24,569
...just like you did Sucre
and Tweener...

470
00:40:24,736 --> 00:40:26,655
...and Haywire.

471
00:40:26,863 --> 00:40:31,368
I'm not your errand boy.
I'm gonna go with you when you escape.

472
00:40:31,993 --> 00:40:35,789
And if you think, in any way...

473
00:40:36,998 --> 00:40:40,085
...that you'll leave me,
I will put this piece of metal...

474
00:40:40,252 --> 00:40:42,921
...right in that very small space...

475
00:40:43,088 --> 00:40:45,423
...right between your eyes.

476
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:47,342
I will.

477
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:15,870
How's L.J.? How's Sara?

478
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,623
They told me they're fine.

479
00:41:18,832 --> 00:41:22,877
- Listen, the gravedigger, he's gone.
- What do you mean, he's gone?

480
00:41:23,086 --> 00:41:26,631
Linc, we can't do this without him.

481
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,883
I know, I know.
We went to his supervisor.

482
00:41:29,426 --> 00:41:31,636
The guy who approves and hires
for that job.

483
00:41:31,803 --> 00:41:34,431
Turns out he could use some cash.

484
00:42:02,542 --> 00:42:04,377
Mail call.

485
00:42:45,043 --> 00:42:47,378
- This is how we're getting out.
- Yes.

486
00:42:47,587 --> 00:42:50,131
With a little help from an old friend.

487
00:42:50,298 --> 00:42:52,926
- What is that?
- Kesslivol.

488
00:42:53,134 --> 00:42:56,387
It's a chemical that kills the odors
caused by decomposing bodies.

489
00:42:56,596 --> 00:43:00,058
And, when heated
to a certain degree...

490
00:43:06,523 --> 00:43:08,858
...it eats through steel.
