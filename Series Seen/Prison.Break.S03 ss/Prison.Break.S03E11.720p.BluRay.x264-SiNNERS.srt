1
00:00:02,318 --> 00:00:03,945
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:04,153 --> 00:00:05,613
The bracing's gonna be tricky.

3
00:00:05,822 --> 00:00:09,659
Unless the tunnel gets proper support,
it's all gonna come down on our heads.

4
00:00:11,202 --> 00:00:14,122
I want you to call her up.
Tell her you got some information.

5
00:00:14,288 --> 00:00:17,250
Make sure she picks you up.
And get in the car, all right?

6
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:19,085
- He even bought a gun.
- Hmm.

7
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:21,045
Just thought you'd wanna know.

8
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:24,924
If you're really leaving,
take me with you. Please.

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,093
I don't wanna be here anymore.

10
00:00:27,844 --> 00:00:29,887
You don't want any part of this.

11
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:35,560
A part of me doesn't wanna
believe he works for them...

12
00:00:35,768 --> 00:00:37,395
...because he's the man I love.

13
00:00:37,603 --> 00:00:39,480
The man who was gonna take me
to Paris.

14
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:41,607
If he doesn't take you, I will.

15
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,238
Impressive, blanco.

16
00:00:47,446 --> 00:00:49,949
Too bad you won't be around
to enjoy it.

17
00:00:54,495 --> 00:00:56,998
How long is this gonna set us back?

18
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,087
All right, we got 24 hours
to dig out that tunnel.

19
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:05,548
The one it took you guys
three days to dig?

20
00:01:05,715 --> 00:01:09,176
Let's just say by some miracle
we are able to part the dirt sea, Moses.

21
00:01:09,343 --> 00:01:10,386
Then what?

22
00:01:10,553 --> 00:01:12,889
How you plan on getting around
the guard's tower?

23
00:01:13,055 --> 00:01:17,768
Michael, Mr. Whistler here says that
you got stopped last time by a cloud--

24
00:01:17,935 --> 00:01:20,271
I'm still working on that.

25
00:01:21,188 --> 00:01:23,190
Wanna know if this girl's
gonna put out...

26
00:01:23,357 --> 00:01:25,735
- ...before I buy her more drinks.
- I agree, Michael.

27
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:29,238
- You know as I do what's riding on this.
- I'd say I know better.

28
00:01:29,447 --> 00:01:31,240
I don't care who knows what.

29
00:01:31,407 --> 00:01:35,036
As long as somebody knows how
we're getting out of here by tomorrow.

30
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:45,921
- You coming?
- Not today.

31
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:50,092
James and I have a lot of things
to clear up.

32
00:01:50,301 --> 00:01:53,137
But I'm done trying to do it
through a fence.

33
00:01:53,929 --> 00:01:55,973
You ever wish
you could go back in time...

34
00:01:56,432 --> 00:02:00,311
...just to remember how it was like
when things made sense?

35
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:03,397
Every day for the last three years.

36
00:02:18,913 --> 00:02:20,790
Is that Whistler's girlfriend?

37
00:02:21,582 --> 00:02:24,502
- Why is she in the car?
- She thinks she'll see him tomorrow.

38
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,671
- Spending a lot of time together.
- And?

39
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,756
You sure that's wise?

40
00:02:28,923 --> 00:02:31,175
- Where are we?
- Behind schedule.

41
00:02:31,342 --> 00:02:34,011
We should be on the same side
of the fence by tomorrow.

42
00:02:34,178 --> 00:02:35,679
What do you mean "should"?

43
00:02:35,846 --> 00:02:38,724
The tunnel gets us into no man's land.
But to get to the fence...

44
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:41,936
...we're gonna need a new diversion
for the tower guards.

45
00:02:42,103 --> 00:02:44,730
- What time?
- Daytime's still our best option.

46
00:02:44,897 --> 00:02:47,191
- They double the guards at night.
- The Jeep patrols?

47
00:02:47,358 --> 00:02:50,611
Yeah.
And, uh, there's something else.

48
00:02:50,945 --> 00:02:52,988
- What?
- T-Bag's coming.

49
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:56,325
And Mahone and Bellick.

50
00:02:56,492 --> 00:02:58,202
Oh, yeah, there's a drug lord too.

51
00:02:58,369 --> 00:03:00,371
It's not about them.
It's about Whistler--

52
00:03:00,538 --> 00:03:02,998
- We don't know who Whistler is.
- What about what he's worth?

53
00:03:03,165 --> 00:03:05,459
My son's life.

54
00:03:05,626 --> 00:03:08,754
I just wish there was another way
to do this.

55
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:11,966
To save L.J.
without handing Whistler over.

56
00:03:12,174 --> 00:03:14,385
Look, man, that's it. There isn't.

57
00:03:15,803 --> 00:03:17,263
I know.

58
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,599
Listen, you worry about the tunnel.
I worry about the guards.

59
00:03:20,766 --> 00:03:23,394
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.

60
00:03:29,817 --> 00:03:33,946
Don't skimp on the braces up there.
In fact, if you wanna add a little extra--

61
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:37,783
You know, we can work on this rail road
all the livelong day.

62
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,244
But it don't matter
if Scofield doesn't know...

63
00:03:40,411 --> 00:03:42,413
...what happens
once we get off the train.

64
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,665
Once we get out,
it's every man for himself.

65
00:03:44,874 --> 00:03:47,793
- Scofield's not responsible for any of us.
- Is that so?

66
00:03:48,002 --> 00:03:51,672
You obviously don't know him
very well, Shakespeare.

67
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:55,843
When we broke out of Fox River,
he tried to screw every one of us.

68
00:03:56,427 --> 00:04:00,264
Half the men ended up either dead,
captured or worse.

69
00:04:00,472 --> 00:04:02,766
The guys who are easiest to catch...

70
00:04:02,933 --> 00:04:06,437
...are the ones who spend more time
pissing and moaning than running.

71
00:04:08,814 --> 00:04:10,107
My only advice to you:

72
00:04:10,941 --> 00:04:13,235
Ecclesiastes 6:13.

73
00:04:13,402 --> 00:04:17,656
Separate thyself from thy enemies
and take heed of thy friends.

74
00:04:17,823 --> 00:04:18,908
How we doing, Alex?

75
00:04:19,074 --> 00:04:21,535
Well, if those braces hold...

76
00:04:22,661 --> 00:04:25,581
...we could be to the surface
some time tomorrow.

77
00:04:25,789 --> 00:04:28,542
Let's rotate. Keep everybody fresh.

78
00:04:29,501 --> 00:04:32,588
Welcome to the coal mine, canary.

79
00:04:45,309 --> 00:04:46,685
We're gonna be here all day.

80
00:04:53,233 --> 00:04:54,360
Yo, man.

81
00:04:55,527 --> 00:04:57,780
Don't drip your body water
upon me like that.

82
00:04:57,988 --> 00:05:00,199
Hey, it ain't coming from me, I swear.

83
00:05:00,407 --> 00:05:02,201
Engineer, come.

84
00:05:02,409 --> 00:05:04,203
Look at this.

85
00:05:07,831 --> 00:05:10,584
- Hit a pipe or something?
- Oh, no.

86
00:05:26,809 --> 00:05:28,268
That's right above our tunnel.

87
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:32,147
The ground's not gonna hold
till tomorrow.

88
00:05:32,314 --> 00:05:34,441
So, what do we do?

89
00:05:34,608 --> 00:05:36,193
We leave tonight.

90
00:06:10,644 --> 00:06:13,772
Tonight? I thought you said
a nighttime escape was impossible.

91
00:06:13,981 --> 00:06:17,359
If the rain keeps up, the tunnel will
collapse again and that'll be the end.

92
00:06:18,068 --> 00:06:20,946
That'll be the end for you.
You're the one on a deadline.

93
00:06:21,155 --> 00:06:23,449
What if it gives out
while we're inside--?

94
00:06:23,657 --> 00:06:24,783
You want out, get out!

95
00:06:28,245 --> 00:06:32,583
Look, you're not pulling this off without
all of us working around the clock.

96
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,086
None of us are making it out
of here without his plan.

97
00:06:36,253 --> 00:06:39,798
So if you tell me that you can figure out
a way how to do this at night...

98
00:06:39,965 --> 00:06:43,719
...then I, we, can figure out a way
how to get that tunnel dug in time.

99
00:06:48,724 --> 00:06:50,601
Let's start digging.

100
00:07:00,485 --> 00:07:01,987
I think you dropped something.

101
00:07:02,154 --> 00:07:05,032
I've read in old newspapers
that make it to Sona...

102
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,577
...how Americans hold others
to standards they ignore.

103
00:07:09,077 --> 00:07:12,206
How they think no one
should have power but them.

104
00:07:12,372 --> 00:07:15,959
I tell everyone it's a lie,
but I see it's true.

105
00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:18,754
I know you're leaving.

106
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:22,716
And to think that after everything
I've done to help...

107
00:07:22,883 --> 00:07:25,552
...I think it sucks
you're not taking me with you.

108
00:07:26,678 --> 00:07:29,139
It doesn't seem like it,
but I'm doing you a favor.

109
00:07:29,306 --> 00:07:30,474
I'm giving you a gift.

110
00:07:30,807 --> 00:07:34,061
Huh. Wow, life in prison? Thank you,
I've always wanted one of those.

111
00:07:34,228 --> 00:07:36,063
It's better than a life on the run.

112
00:07:36,271 --> 00:07:37,773
I don't belong here.

113
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,233
- All I did was give a guy--
- You're not going.

114
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:45,155
I'm sorry. It's for the best.

115
00:07:45,322 --> 00:07:47,366
How do you know
what's best for me?

116
00:07:53,705 --> 00:07:55,624
Okay.

117
00:07:55,874 --> 00:07:57,125
It's good to go.

118
00:07:57,793 --> 00:07:59,336
You know where and when to be?

119
00:07:59,544 --> 00:08:01,797
- If you're not there, we're screwed.
- Yeah.

120
00:08:05,092 --> 00:08:07,469
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

121
00:08:07,636 --> 00:08:09,846
- I'm just gonna grab my stuff.
- Yeah.

122
00:08:10,722 --> 00:08:13,725
It's probably best
if you and James disappear.

123
00:08:13,934 --> 00:08:16,395
I know. I know.

124
00:08:16,603 --> 00:08:18,981
You know where to meet us, right?

125
00:08:19,523 --> 00:08:22,109
Playa Blanca. You will be on the...?

126
00:08:22,317 --> 00:08:24,611
- Three-twelve.
- Three-twelve.

127
00:08:24,778 --> 00:08:27,030
Well, I'll see you tomorrow, then.

128
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:29,324
- Good luck.
- You too.

129
00:08:30,701 --> 00:08:32,828
Hey, it's that Susan chick.
She wants to meet again.

130
00:08:33,578 --> 00:08:35,706
Good. Let her know
everything's on track.

131
00:08:35,872 --> 00:08:38,291
We wanna make her feel
as comfortable as possible.

132
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:41,086
Why shouldn't she be?
She's gonna get her guy tomorrow.

133
00:08:41,461 --> 00:08:44,089
Well, if Michael's conscience
doesn't get in the way.

134
00:08:45,757 --> 00:08:46,967
What do you mean?

135
00:08:47,384 --> 00:08:48,802
He's having doubts.

136
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:52,139
- About if he can pull it off?
- About if he should.

137
00:08:52,556 --> 00:08:55,308
But he's gonna
go through with it, right?

138
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,905
What are you looking for?

139
00:09:09,114 --> 00:09:12,409
Where the power lines connect
to Sona's exterior lights.

140
00:09:13,118 --> 00:09:15,829
If cutting the power was an option,
why didn't we do that?

141
00:09:16,037 --> 00:09:18,957
One, the power out there
isn't controlled from in here.

142
00:09:19,124 --> 00:09:21,668
And two, there's that.

143
00:09:22,627 --> 00:09:25,589
Every prison has a backup generator.
If we cut the lights...

144
00:09:26,006 --> 00:09:29,843
...they'll just come back on
again, immediately.

145
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:32,220
Well, that's a big, bloody problem.

146
00:09:32,387 --> 00:09:33,847
Tell Lechero I need his phone.

147
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:39,936
Change of plans,
Linc. We're doing this tonight.

148
00:09:40,145 --> 00:09:42,564
Tonight? What happened, Michael?

149
00:09:42,772 --> 00:09:44,566
Rain, dirt, tunnel problem.

150
00:09:44,774 --> 00:09:47,027
- How long can it hold?
- That depends.

151
00:09:47,194 --> 00:09:48,278
Depends on what?

152
00:09:50,614 --> 00:09:51,948
When the rain stops.

153
00:09:52,699 --> 00:09:54,951
You said breaking out at night
was impossible.

154
00:09:55,118 --> 00:09:56,203
Yeah, well...

155
00:09:56,369 --> 00:09:58,622
Wanna tell me
how you're gonna pull this off?

156
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:01,750
For starters,
I need to get ahold of Sucre.

157
00:10:13,511 --> 00:10:16,681
Sucre, do you know
what I do for a living?

158
00:10:17,891 --> 00:10:19,184
I have a pretty good idea.

159
00:10:20,185 --> 00:10:21,269
I read people.

160
00:10:21,436 --> 00:10:25,273
And you, my friend,
are a coloring book.

161
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:29,569
I think you left this in my car.

162
00:10:30,487 --> 00:10:33,073
- Look, that was just-- I mean, we--
- No.

163
00:10:33,281 --> 00:10:35,784
No, no, no. My fault.

164
00:10:36,451 --> 00:10:38,578
I guess I just didn't
make myself clear...

165
00:10:38,745 --> 00:10:41,248
...when I laid out the terms
of our arrangement.

166
00:10:41,456 --> 00:10:45,001
So I'm gonna try again
as simply as I know how.

167
00:10:45,168 --> 00:10:46,419
Anything happens...

168
00:10:47,003 --> 00:10:49,464
...anything at all
that I wasn't expecting...

169
00:10:49,631 --> 00:10:52,259
...and there will be one less pregnant girl
in Chicago.

170
00:10:52,425 --> 00:10:55,136
Look, Michael and Lincoln
don't tell me everything.

171
00:10:55,345 --> 00:10:59,057
Fernando, this is your last chance.
I want a yes or a no.

172
00:10:59,224 --> 00:11:02,268
Are the brothers going to break Whistler
out of Sona?

173
00:11:02,477 --> 00:11:03,687
Yes.

174
00:11:03,853 --> 00:11:06,106
Are they planning on handing him
over to me?

175
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:09,442
Yes.

176
00:11:10,902 --> 00:11:13,196
Where do you want me
to shoot Maricruz first?

177
00:11:13,655 --> 00:11:15,782
In the bun or in the oven?

178
00:11:16,366 --> 00:11:17,534
Okay.

179
00:11:23,957 --> 00:11:26,001
There's one thing I heard.

180
00:11:26,167 --> 00:11:29,629
It's Michael. He's having
some concerns about Whistler.

181
00:11:30,171 --> 00:11:31,840
What kind of concerns?

182
00:11:32,757 --> 00:11:34,342
About handing him over.

183
00:11:36,594 --> 00:11:40,390
You got to understand, he broke out
some pretty bad guys last time.

184
00:11:40,557 --> 00:11:43,643
I think he's never forgiven himself
for that.

185
00:11:44,102 --> 00:11:47,731
- He's planning on leaving him behind?
- Maybe. I don't know.

186
00:11:53,945 --> 00:11:55,280
Shh.

187
00:11:57,157 --> 00:11:58,533
Hello, Lincoln.

188
00:11:59,117 --> 00:12:00,577
It's going down tonight.

189
00:12:01,411 --> 00:12:02,495
Tonight?

190
00:12:03,288 --> 00:12:04,956
Should I be worried?

191
00:12:05,373 --> 00:12:08,293
I called you first thing.
I'm being straight up with you.

192
00:12:09,377 --> 00:12:10,920
Oh, that's refreshing.

193
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:12,922
So I'll see you tonight.

194
00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:16,676
Hmm. You show me yours
and I'll show you mine.

195
00:12:19,345 --> 00:12:22,766
It's going down tonight.
Do you know about that?

196
00:12:23,433 --> 00:12:25,810
I didn't know, I swear.

197
00:12:30,648 --> 00:12:32,609
Get out of here.

198
00:12:44,662 --> 00:12:46,748
- How'd it go?
- She found the bomb, Linc.

199
00:12:47,123 --> 00:12:48,958
The one we put in her car.

200
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:50,835
How did she find the bomb, Sucre?

201
00:12:51,044 --> 00:12:52,462
I don't know, bro. I'm sorry.

202
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:55,840
- It's not your fault.
- Look, I'll make it up to you, I swear.

203
00:12:57,425 --> 00:13:00,637
You can start now.
Michael's in a bit of trouble at Sona.

204
00:13:00,803 --> 00:13:03,014
What kind of trouble?

205
00:13:06,601 --> 00:13:08,311
The rain stopped.

206
00:13:08,478 --> 00:13:11,272
- Does that mean that--?
- No, the damage is done.

207
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,108
We can't risk waiting.

208
00:13:19,906 --> 00:13:21,699
Anything interesting?

209
00:13:21,908 --> 00:13:23,159
Like some coordinates...

210
00:13:23,368 --> 00:13:26,120
...the Company might wanna get
their hands on?

211
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,666
If they didn't want me out of here...

212
00:13:29,832 --> 00:13:33,753
...and your nephew was safe,
would you still be doing this?

213
00:13:33,962 --> 00:13:35,964
Breaking out?

214
00:13:37,131 --> 00:13:38,675
No.

215
00:13:38,841 --> 00:13:42,345
Why would you choose to stay
if there was a chance at freedom?

216
00:13:42,804 --> 00:13:45,515
Well, I guess that's the difference
between us.

217
00:13:45,682 --> 00:13:47,684
I'm willing to pay for my sins.

218
00:13:47,892 --> 00:13:49,018
And I'm not?

219
00:13:49,686 --> 00:13:51,271
That's a good question.

220
00:13:59,821 --> 00:14:02,031
Water's coming down pretty fast
up in here, patrón.

221
00:14:02,198 --> 00:14:04,701
Then we have to dig faster.

222
00:14:05,952 --> 00:14:07,370
You know, I've been thinking.

223
00:14:07,537 --> 00:14:09,622
It doesn't have to be every man
for himself.

224
00:14:09,789 --> 00:14:12,834
You and I can help each other.

225
00:14:13,042 --> 00:14:16,462
If I need a hand,
I'll find someone with a spare.

226
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:20,008
Heh-heh-heh. It's true, I may be
lacking something in the west...

227
00:14:20,174 --> 00:14:22,969
...but I more than make up for it
in the north.

228
00:14:23,177 --> 00:14:26,514
Think about it. Scofield's got us
down here doing manual labor.

229
00:14:26,681 --> 00:14:28,850
Slave labor.

230
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:34,355
I ain't no slave.
I'm doing this for me.

231
00:14:34,564 --> 00:14:37,025
Why do you think Scofield's up
and we're down here?

232
00:14:37,191 --> 00:14:38,693
He's planning something.

233
00:14:40,278 --> 00:14:41,946
Who among us isn't?

234
00:14:44,115 --> 00:14:45,908
What the hell is that?

235
00:16:22,797 --> 00:16:24,715
- We're good.
- Yeah.

236
00:16:24,882 --> 00:16:27,009
- We're all right.
- Yeah.

237
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,117
- Yeah?
- Hello, Lincoln.

238
00:16:51,284 --> 00:16:52,577
Long time no see.

239
00:16:52,952 --> 00:16:54,036
Not long enough.

240
00:16:54,203 --> 00:16:57,373
I was thinking that we could have
a little chat in person.

241
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:00,167
Make sure we're all on the same page
about tonight.

242
00:17:00,376 --> 00:17:03,587
- All right.
- Thirty minutes. This location.

243
00:17:07,675 --> 00:17:09,343
Jorge.

244
00:17:09,802 --> 00:17:11,679
Jorge.

245
00:17:12,346 --> 00:17:13,431
Hey, uh...

246
00:17:19,812 --> 00:17:20,855
Ah.

247
00:17:30,323 --> 00:17:31,866
- Hello?
- Hey, papi, it's me.

248
00:17:32,491 --> 00:17:33,701
Hey.

249
00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:35,828
Lincoln said you needed some help.

250
00:17:35,995 --> 00:17:38,539
How much do you know
about electricity?

251
00:17:42,793 --> 00:17:43,961
Hey, you're back.

252
00:17:44,128 --> 00:17:47,048
I'm not real comfortable
being alone down here with those--

253
00:17:48,758 --> 00:17:51,260
What's that, syrup?

254
00:17:51,469 --> 00:17:54,555
Honey. Make a little pile of dirt,
gather some dirt.

255
00:17:56,599 --> 00:18:01,187
Scofield said we gotta make something
to cover the hole, once we get out.

256
00:18:01,353 --> 00:18:03,230
So when the lights
come back on, uh...

257
00:18:03,814 --> 00:18:06,275
...it's gonna look like nobody
ever left.

258
00:18:06,484 --> 00:18:08,527
All right, spread it around.

259
00:18:09,904 --> 00:18:14,116
I was thinking, uh,
we should be a team.

260
00:18:14,325 --> 00:18:16,368
Not just during the escape, but after.

261
00:18:16,535 --> 00:18:18,871
Like Butch and Sundance.

262
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:20,831
Butch and Sundance died.

263
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,708
I mean in the other parts.

264
00:18:22,917 --> 00:18:25,544
Now, here's an idea.
We go along with Scofield's plan.

265
00:18:25,711 --> 00:18:28,047
When everyone stops to take a breath,
we grab them:

266
00:18:28,214 --> 00:18:29,673
Burrows, Scofield, Bagwell.

267
00:18:29,882 --> 00:18:32,259
Take them back home, face charges.
We'd be heroes.

268
00:18:32,468 --> 00:18:36,305
We might get a book deal. We could
write it together. How would that be?

269
00:18:36,472 --> 00:18:37,890
- A book deal?
- Yeah.

270
00:18:38,641 --> 00:18:41,519
- That'll make you happy, Brad?
- You got a better idea?

271
00:18:42,895 --> 00:18:44,104
Yeah, I do.

272
00:18:44,313 --> 00:18:47,566
- Something to do with the wife and kid?
- Yeah, something like that.

273
00:18:47,775 --> 00:18:49,193
You...

274
00:18:49,401 --> 00:18:51,028
You got room for one more?

275
00:18:51,654 --> 00:18:54,281
I mean, come on, Alex.
What's a guy like me gonna do?

276
00:18:55,407 --> 00:18:59,662
Let's just let Scofield get us out of here.
Then we'll worry about everything else.

277
00:18:59,829 --> 00:19:02,331
- All right.
- Come on, a little more dirt.

278
00:19:04,834 --> 00:19:08,170
Listen very carefully
and do exactly as I tell you.

279
00:19:08,337 --> 00:19:10,381
You sure you don't want Linc
to do this?

280
00:19:10,548 --> 00:19:12,424
He knows more about this
than I do.

281
00:19:12,633 --> 00:19:14,760
It's not what you know,
it's where you work.

282
00:19:14,969 --> 00:19:16,929
And as a Sona employee, my friend...

283
00:19:17,096 --> 00:19:20,891
...you have the unique ability
of not getting shot for being here.

284
00:19:22,643 --> 00:19:24,103
You see the admin building?

285
00:19:24,311 --> 00:19:26,730
- I see it.
- Go to it and make a left.

286
00:19:26,939 --> 00:19:29,900
To it and left. Got it.

287
00:19:30,067 --> 00:19:31,819
On the other side is a berm.

288
00:19:32,236 --> 00:19:35,823
There should be a metal cage.
That's the backup generator.

289
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,704
Okay, I see it.

290
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:45,249
But don't let the tower guard
see you get too close. Just act casual.

291
00:19:46,292 --> 00:19:49,211
When I say "now,"
you run and duck behind it.

292
00:19:54,758 --> 00:19:56,260
Almost.

293
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,599
Hold on.

294
00:20:04,226 --> 00:20:05,394
Now.

295
00:20:12,693 --> 00:20:15,237
Okay. Okay.

296
00:20:15,404 --> 00:20:17,823
There should be
some writing near the bottom.

297
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:21,618
I need the name of the manufacturer.
Make, model number, anything.

298
00:20:22,411 --> 00:20:23,996
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it.
It's, uh--

299
00:20:24,204 --> 00:20:27,499
It's, uh, Prana industrial.

300
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:30,461
Model number 3210.

301
00:20:31,086 --> 00:20:33,714
Three-two-one-zero?
Is there a customer service number?

302
00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:38,719
It's 1-800-555-0196.

303
00:20:38,886 --> 00:20:42,264
All right, thanks. That's all I need.

304
00:20:42,931 --> 00:20:46,310
- You think you can pull this off tonight?
- You wanna know the truth?

305
00:20:46,477 --> 00:20:49,396
No, I just want all of it
to go down smooth.

306
00:20:49,605 --> 00:20:51,815
For everyone to get what they want.

307
00:20:52,232 --> 00:20:53,734
Yeah, I do.

308
00:20:53,901 --> 00:20:57,446
Listen, even if you get this worked out
with the lights...

309
00:20:57,613 --> 00:20:59,782
...what will you do
about the Jeep patrols?

310
00:20:59,948 --> 00:21:03,619
- We're gonna have to take our chances.
- Maybe you don't.

311
00:21:24,765 --> 00:21:25,891
You all right?

312
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:28,018
Yeah, I'm fine.

313
00:21:28,727 --> 00:21:31,271
- Where's L.J.?
- Somewhere safe.

314
00:21:31,438 --> 00:21:34,691
Take a load off.
Can I offer you a drink?

315
00:21:36,276 --> 00:21:37,402
What's going on, Susan?

316
00:21:37,611 --> 00:21:40,948
I wanted to get everyone together
so we can discuss tonight's agenda.

317
00:21:41,115 --> 00:21:42,741
Maybe nail down a few guidelines.

318
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:44,535
It's the same. Nothing's changed.

319
00:21:44,743 --> 00:21:48,080
Actually, I was thinking we should
probably include all the players.

320
00:21:48,497 --> 00:21:50,249
Don't you?

321
00:21:52,417 --> 00:21:54,503
What are you doing in here?

322
00:21:55,462 --> 00:21:56,755
Just keeping watch.

323
00:21:57,464 --> 00:22:00,509
Make sure nobody tries
to get down to the tunnel.

324
00:22:02,719 --> 00:22:04,012
Who are you calling?

325
00:22:04,221 --> 00:22:06,598
Yeah, hi,
is this, uh, Customer Service?

326
00:22:06,765 --> 00:22:10,102
Yeah, I'm, uh-- I'm a sub working
a building down here in Panama.

327
00:22:10,269 --> 00:22:12,813
And, um,
we've got a client on site.

328
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:16,900
They're asking questions about
the 3210 generator we're installing.

329
00:22:17,067 --> 00:22:18,944
Yeah, exactly.

330
00:22:19,111 --> 00:22:21,989
Um, they wanna know
if the main power shuts down...

331
00:22:22,155 --> 00:22:24,032
...how long are they
gonna be in the dark...

332
00:22:24,199 --> 00:22:27,953
...um, before the generator
kicks in?

333
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,414
Yeah, thanks. I'll hold.

334
00:22:30,622 --> 00:22:32,332
You're a very good liar.

335
00:22:35,043 --> 00:22:37,129
That's the timing?

336
00:22:38,046 --> 00:22:41,800
No, that's, uh...
That's it. Appreciate it.

337
00:22:44,177 --> 00:22:46,680
Well? We gonna make it?

338
00:22:46,889 --> 00:22:49,099
We should have just enough dark
to make it out.

339
00:22:49,391 --> 00:22:50,475
With everyone?

340
00:22:52,102 --> 00:22:54,021
- Hey.
- You with Whistler?

341
00:22:56,231 --> 00:22:57,316
Yes.

342
00:22:57,524 --> 00:23:00,861
Susan's with me.
She wants to get a message to him.

343
00:23:01,653 --> 00:23:03,488
- Why?
- Put him on.

344
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,660
It's for you.

345
00:23:13,206 --> 00:23:15,125
- Yes?
- All right, I got him. What now?

346
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,003
Tell him I want him to listen
very carefully...

347
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:20,005
...to the following instructions.

348
00:23:20,422 --> 00:23:23,467
- She wants you to listen--
- I can hear. Instructions about what?

349
00:23:23,634 --> 00:23:24,718
James?

350
00:23:24,926 --> 00:23:27,512
Was that Sofia? Is she there?

351
00:23:27,721 --> 00:23:30,057
- Yeah.
- What's going on?

352
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:34,227
- He wants to know what this is about.
- All right, I'll tell him.

353
00:23:34,645 --> 00:23:36,772
- Aah!
- No!

354
00:23:38,774 --> 00:23:40,609
Was--? Was that Sof--?

355
00:23:41,985 --> 00:23:43,070
Is that Sofia?

356
00:23:43,487 --> 00:23:45,113
Is that Sofia?

357
00:23:48,909 --> 00:23:52,162
Have you figured out
the coordinates yet, James?

358
00:23:54,247 --> 00:23:55,707
Please.

359
00:23:55,874 --> 00:23:57,626
- Almost.
- Wrong answer.

360
00:23:57,834 --> 00:23:58,919
- No!
- No!

361
00:23:59,086 --> 00:24:01,963
I'll get them for you
when we get out of here, I swear.

362
00:24:02,172 --> 00:24:04,341
All your promises, your guarantees...

363
00:24:05,175 --> 00:24:06,551
...they mean nothing.

364
00:24:06,718 --> 00:24:09,805
I'm pretty sick of waiting around
for you boys to screw me over.

365
00:24:10,972 --> 00:24:13,600
I'm gonna need those coordinates
by the end of the day.

366
00:24:13,767 --> 00:24:15,936
No. Aah!

367
00:24:37,249 --> 00:24:39,626
I've gotta figure this out.

368
00:24:39,793 --> 00:24:43,547
I've gotta do something.
I've gotta do something.

369
00:24:44,965 --> 00:24:48,593
We both know that you can't
just hand over that information.

370
00:24:48,802 --> 00:24:50,887
Why? Why can't I?

371
00:24:51,096 --> 00:24:54,558
Once they get what they want,
they'll have no reason to keep you...

372
00:24:54,933 --> 00:24:57,477
...or your girlfriend
or my nephew alive.

373
00:24:57,686 --> 00:24:59,396
So, what do I do?

374
00:25:00,313 --> 00:25:02,983
I just let them torture Sofia?

375
00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:05,110
We'll work something out.

376
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,405
We'll think it through.

377
00:25:08,613 --> 00:25:10,740
I already have.

378
00:25:17,998 --> 00:25:20,000
Whistler.

379
00:25:20,584 --> 00:25:24,921
Whistler. What is so special
about him, anyway, huh?

380
00:25:25,755 --> 00:25:26,965
Huh?

381
00:25:27,632 --> 00:25:31,511
Do you think he has anything to do
with why they want Scofield down here?

382
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,680
It's really none of my business.

383
00:25:33,847 --> 00:25:36,725
- What exactly is your business?
- Something on your mind?

384
00:25:38,351 --> 00:25:41,646
I'm just saying,
if we needed a bargaining chip...

385
00:25:41,813 --> 00:25:46,318
...you think a sharp stick
in that dull limey would help us out?

386
00:25:46,735 --> 00:25:48,194
There is no "us."

387
00:25:48,361 --> 00:25:52,032
You and me are a lot more alike
than you think, Alex.

388
00:25:52,824 --> 00:25:56,661
We both know how it feels
to lose a great love.

389
00:25:56,828 --> 00:25:59,456
How it feels to kill a man.

390
00:25:59,664 --> 00:26:02,208
We both ended up in here
because of Michael Scofield.

391
00:26:02,375 --> 00:26:06,630
Wouldn't it be poetic justice
if we could just return the favor?

392
00:26:06,838 --> 00:26:08,715
Justice?

393
00:26:10,967 --> 00:26:14,638
If there was an ounce of it
left in this world...

394
00:26:16,431 --> 00:26:19,142
...you'd be lying face down
in the same unmarked grave...

395
00:26:19,309 --> 00:26:21,603
...as the rest of your inbred family.

396
00:26:26,358 --> 00:26:29,319
The only difference between me
and you, Alex, is a badge.

397
00:26:29,778 --> 00:26:31,529
Last time I checked,
you didn't have that.

398
00:26:31,696 --> 00:26:34,449
So you can just keep on hoping
for your happy endings.

399
00:26:34,658 --> 00:26:37,160
You just keep on plowing ahead
with them blinders on.

400
00:26:37,327 --> 00:26:40,330
But the thing about them blinders is...

401
00:26:40,538 --> 00:26:43,458
...it makes it really hard
to watch your back.

402
00:26:51,883 --> 00:26:53,718
It's gonna be better soon, I promise.

403
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,346
He's right, you know.

404
00:26:56,513 --> 00:26:59,516
If James loves you,
he'll give us what we want.

405
00:27:00,016 --> 00:27:03,603
And then you and your white knight
can ride off into the sunset.

406
00:27:04,979 --> 00:27:07,065
Unless you're already with him.

407
00:27:09,442 --> 00:27:10,819
You scared, Susan?

408
00:27:11,486 --> 00:27:13,154
Do I look scared, Lincoln?

409
00:27:13,363 --> 00:27:15,698
Pull something like this...

410
00:27:16,866 --> 00:27:19,536
- You desperate?
- You need to stop fighting with me.

411
00:27:19,702 --> 00:27:22,580
If you really understood,
you'd know we're not the bad guys.

412
00:27:22,747 --> 00:27:23,873
Could've fooled me.

413
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,334
Ever done
the wrong things for the right reason?

414
00:27:26,501 --> 00:27:27,961
What are the right reasons?

415
00:27:28,545 --> 00:27:31,756
What is it about Whistler
that's so important?

416
00:27:34,551 --> 00:27:37,679
I could tell you,
but then I'd have to kill you.

417
00:27:39,722 --> 00:27:41,224
You're gonna do that anyway.

418
00:27:42,642 --> 00:27:46,813
Whistler gives us what we want,
maybe I won't have to.

419
00:27:52,652 --> 00:27:54,571
Linc called.

420
00:27:54,737 --> 00:27:56,739
They're on their way.

421
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,868
I figured them out.

422
00:28:01,035 --> 00:28:02,954
The coordinates.

423
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,040
I'm gonna hand them over.

424
00:28:06,249 --> 00:28:10,336
I thought you should know, so you can
take whatever precautions you can.

425
00:28:11,004 --> 00:28:14,883
What if, uh-- What if you give them
the wrong coordinates?

426
00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:16,676
It might buy us some more time.

427
00:28:16,885 --> 00:28:19,929
- Maybe Linc can get Sofia to safety.
- Like he did with Sara?

428
00:28:23,683 --> 00:28:25,768
I'm sorry, I...

429
00:28:26,477 --> 00:28:29,606
I didn't mean to. I, uh...

430
00:28:30,481 --> 00:28:33,443
I just don't know what else to do.

431
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:35,904
I'm damned if I do, damned if I don't.

432
00:28:36,863 --> 00:28:37,947
There's no way to win.

433
00:28:38,114 --> 00:28:40,617
It's not about winning anymore,
it's about surviving.

434
00:28:40,783 --> 00:28:44,162
- Which is not the same as giving up.
- But you can go gracefully.

435
00:28:46,122 --> 00:28:48,416
There's honor,
protecting the ones you love.

436
00:28:48,791 --> 00:28:51,336
Honor's a luxury
men like us can't afford.

437
00:28:53,296 --> 00:28:55,840
Can you promise me
we'll make it out of here tonight?

438
00:28:56,049 --> 00:28:57,842
No games.

439
00:28:58,051 --> 00:28:59,469
Can you honestly promise me?

440
00:28:59,886 --> 00:29:02,221
I can promise you
I'll do everything in my power.

441
00:29:04,432 --> 00:29:06,142
I wish that were good enough.

442
00:29:06,309 --> 00:29:09,479
If you do this,
if you give them what they want...

443
00:29:10,521 --> 00:29:13,983
...everything that's been lost
will have been for nothing.

444
00:29:27,705 --> 00:29:29,207
Monjares.

445
00:30:24,262 --> 00:30:26,055
Jorge.

446
00:30:59,297 --> 00:31:01,799
Whistler, you have a visitor.

447
00:31:26,824 --> 00:31:29,368
Linc, he's gonna give it to them.

448
00:31:29,577 --> 00:31:31,120
Relax. I'll see you in a minute.

449
00:31:31,287 --> 00:31:33,331
What are you talking about?

450
00:31:36,083 --> 00:31:37,919
Scofield, you have a visitor.

451
00:31:41,756 --> 00:31:44,342
I suppose introductions
are unnecessary at this point.

452
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:46,177
What are we doing here, Gretchen?

453
00:31:46,385 --> 00:31:47,803
We're here to say goodbye.

454
00:31:48,012 --> 00:31:50,890
I promise you,
they're not gonna hurt you anymore.

455
00:31:51,098 --> 00:31:53,517
Do you have the coordinates, James?

456
00:31:54,018 --> 00:31:55,394
- Yes.
- I'm sorry.

457
00:31:56,646 --> 00:31:58,689
- I tried to run away--
- This isn't your fault.

458
00:31:59,982 --> 00:32:01,817
It's mine.

459
00:32:02,652 --> 00:32:05,821
When I took this job,
I knew they weren't good people.

460
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:09,283
I just didn't know how bad they were.

461
00:32:10,534 --> 00:32:12,536
And everything that's happened...

462
00:32:16,916 --> 00:32:19,126
...it's all because of me.

463
00:32:19,835 --> 00:32:22,338
For that, I'm truly sorry.

464
00:32:22,505 --> 00:32:23,798
The coordinates.

465
00:32:25,174 --> 00:32:27,343
Just pass them through.

466
00:32:36,102 --> 00:32:37,895
What the hell are you doing?

467
00:32:38,062 --> 00:32:39,855
I'm buying some goodwill.

468
00:32:40,731 --> 00:32:42,608
You're buying her funeral.

469
00:32:42,775 --> 00:32:44,819
You know I have what you need.

470
00:32:45,486 --> 00:32:47,530
And I'll give you the rest.

471
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:53,160
But only after I know that Sofia,
that L.J...

472
00:32:54,078 --> 00:32:56,622
...and that these men here...

473
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,209
...they're all safe.

474
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,462
Do you understand me?

475
00:33:03,963 --> 00:33:05,715
James.

476
00:33:06,132 --> 00:33:08,843
Everything's gonna be all right.

477
00:33:09,009 --> 00:33:10,553
I'm impressed.

478
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,639
Seems our fisherman grew himself
a set of oysters.

479
00:33:14,306 --> 00:33:17,560
Can you really trust these men
with her life?

480
00:33:20,187 --> 00:33:22,815
Yeah. Yeah, I believe I can.

481
00:33:23,983 --> 00:33:26,110
All right, James.

482
00:33:26,694 --> 00:33:29,780
But there's been some confusion
about the timing of things.

483
00:33:29,947 --> 00:33:32,158
Last-minute changes, et cetera.

484
00:33:32,658 --> 00:33:34,452
Gonna make this clear
for everyone involved.

485
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:36,954
If time runs out...

486
00:33:37,121 --> 00:33:39,707
...and I don't have the second half
of those coordinates...

487
00:33:39,874 --> 00:33:42,960
...L.J. and the señorita stop breathing.

488
00:33:47,506 --> 00:33:49,508
- Say goodbye, sweetheart.
- Lincoln.

489
00:33:49,842 --> 00:33:52,511
- Linc--
- Don't be stupid, Lincoln.

490
00:34:00,811 --> 00:34:02,480
I've helped you.

491
00:34:04,773 --> 00:34:06,108
Now you help me.

492
00:34:08,903 --> 00:34:10,571
Please.

493
00:34:12,448 --> 00:34:14,867
Just get us out of here.

494
00:34:28,464 --> 00:34:30,299
You sure about the backup generator?

495
00:34:30,466 --> 00:34:33,761
Yeah. All we gotta do now
is cut the power to the exterior lights.

496
00:34:34,386 --> 00:34:35,930
- How you gonna do that?
- I'm not.

497
00:34:36,096 --> 00:34:38,974
They can't be accessed
from the inside.

498
00:34:40,809 --> 00:34:44,605
- How much time have I got?
- Let's say, uh, 5:15 tomorrow morning.

499
00:34:44,772 --> 00:34:47,650
That should give us time to dig out
before the sun comes up.

500
00:34:47,858 --> 00:34:49,693
- What about Whistler?
- What about him?

501
00:34:49,902 --> 00:34:52,571
He could've handed over
the information, but he didn't.

502
00:34:52,738 --> 00:34:57,159
- Still concerned about handing him over?
- I've got concerns about everybody.

503
00:34:57,326 --> 00:34:59,245
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

504
00:35:00,579 --> 00:35:02,665
Mostly I'm just tired.

505
00:35:02,831 --> 00:35:05,334
Tired of choices...

506
00:35:06,001 --> 00:35:07,586
...and consequences.

507
00:35:07,962 --> 00:35:10,339
I just want this to be over. Tonight.

508
00:35:12,132 --> 00:35:13,467
Let's do it.

509
00:35:31,235 --> 00:35:35,781
When you're on the run, you're always
looking over your shoulder...

510
00:35:36,532 --> 00:35:38,867
...listening for the sirens.

511
00:35:39,034 --> 00:35:42,329
Wondering if that pretty girl
across the street is staring at you...

512
00:35:42,496 --> 00:35:46,625
...because she wants you
or because you're wanted.

513
00:35:49,962 --> 00:35:53,716
You change your name,
the way you look.

514
00:35:54,258 --> 00:35:56,218
Leave everything
you ever knew behind.

515
00:35:56,427 --> 00:36:01,390
And the ones you love,
they're the ones who have to pay.

516
00:36:02,683 --> 00:36:04,601
That's what's waiting for you
on the outside.

517
00:36:04,768 --> 00:36:06,687
That's why I couldn't bring you on.

518
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:11,066
Because nothing good
can come of this.

519
00:36:12,568 --> 00:36:14,528
Can anything good come
from staying in?

520
00:36:17,823 --> 00:36:20,200
It has to be your decision.

521
00:36:21,034 --> 00:36:23,704
I cannot be responsible for you.

522
00:36:25,414 --> 00:36:27,499
You won't have to be.

523
00:36:30,627 --> 00:36:33,797
Does your father still have
that phone number I gave you?

524
00:36:35,716 --> 00:36:36,800
I think so.

525
00:36:37,342 --> 00:36:39,094
Well, tell him to call my brother...

526
00:36:39,261 --> 00:36:41,972
...if he wants to find out
where to pick you up tomorrow.

527
00:36:45,058 --> 00:36:46,935
Does that mean...?

528
00:36:47,436 --> 00:36:50,689
It means if a million things
fall in place...

529
00:36:51,523 --> 00:36:53,609
I'm gonna see my father tomorrow.

530
00:36:55,611 --> 00:36:57,780
Don't let anyone see you
with that phone.

531
00:37:08,874 --> 00:37:11,251
I think we did it, Michael.
I believe we're ready.

532
00:37:11,418 --> 00:37:13,170
She's a little wet, but she's ready.

533
00:37:13,378 --> 00:37:16,381
Makes me think of the first thing I'd do
when we gonna get out.

534
00:37:16,548 --> 00:37:20,135
It's just-- Does anybody know
what's Spanish for "Don't shoot"?

535
00:37:20,385 --> 00:37:21,428
No dispare.

536
00:37:21,595 --> 00:37:22,888
- No dis what?
- Just relax.

537
00:37:23,055 --> 00:37:25,098
Nobody's gonna get shot.
Just don't panic.

538
00:37:25,307 --> 00:37:27,267
As soon as Linc cuts the power,
we go.

539
00:37:27,684 --> 00:37:29,686
- What about the Jeep patrol?
- Taken care of.

540
00:37:29,895 --> 00:37:31,563
What about the backup generator?

541
00:37:32,147 --> 00:37:34,149
- Backup generator?
- Nobody said anything--

542
00:37:34,358 --> 00:37:37,361
There's a lag when the power cuts
to when the generator kicks in.

543
00:37:37,569 --> 00:37:39,613
Well, how long a lag
we talking about here?

544
00:37:39,821 --> 00:37:41,198
Thirty seconds.

545
00:37:42,991 --> 00:37:45,494
And you expect us to run
in 30 seconds?

546
00:37:45,702 --> 00:37:47,913
As soon as the lights go out,
I'm gone.

547
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:50,666
With or without you.

548
00:39:05,115 --> 00:39:06,324
Jorge Rivera.

549
00:39:21,381 --> 00:39:23,008
Now.

550
00:39:24,968 --> 00:39:26,678
Let's go.

551
00:39:31,266 --> 00:39:33,769
Off the bus, now. Get off the bus!

552
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:51,578
As soon as the lights go out,
we gotta be ready to move.

553
00:39:51,787 --> 00:39:54,623
- What's the taquito doing down here?
- He's coming with us.

554
00:39:54,831 --> 00:39:56,875
- I don't think so.
- That's not up to you.

555
00:39:57,834 --> 00:39:58,877
Huh.

556
00:39:59,085 --> 00:40:00,170
Actually, I think...

557
00:40:01,004 --> 00:40:03,715
- Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
- See, we made a little, uh...

558
00:40:03,882 --> 00:40:04,966
...decision here.

559
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:08,094
What with the time frame
being so short and all...

560
00:40:08,303 --> 00:40:10,514
...we'd feel better
if we could go first.

561
00:40:10,722 --> 00:40:13,058
- What are you gonna do, kill me?
- No, no.

562
00:40:14,017 --> 00:40:17,103
- If we ain't first, he's not going.
- All right, all right. Just...

563
00:40:40,627 --> 00:40:42,087
All right.

564
00:40:42,254 --> 00:40:43,713
All right, go. Just go.

565
00:40:44,881 --> 00:40:46,758
Just go.

566
00:40:56,101 --> 00:40:58,478
Every man for himself, right?

567
00:41:13,868 --> 00:41:15,996
You wanna move up in line too?

568
00:41:17,581 --> 00:41:20,625
No, I think I'm gonna stay back here.

569
00:41:21,209 --> 00:41:24,087
I just don't wanna turn my back
on anybody.

570
00:42:51,841 --> 00:42:54,594
Thirty seconds. Go.
