1
00:00:02,518 --> 00:00:04,562
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:04,729 --> 00:00:07,106
Did you ask for a recent photo
of L.J. and Sara?

3
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:08,607
Yeah.

4
00:00:08,816 --> 00:00:10,901
- Where is it?
- She showed me the pictures...

5
00:00:11,068 --> 00:00:13,696
- ...but wouldn't let me keep them.
- All right.

6
00:00:13,904 --> 00:00:15,323
I wanna know who this guy is.

7
00:00:15,489 --> 00:00:17,867
Said his name was Sullins.

8
00:00:18,075 --> 00:00:19,827
Alex, thanks for coming in.

9
00:00:20,619 --> 00:00:22,580
- Hello, Lang.
- What's going on?

10
00:00:22,747 --> 00:00:25,499
There's all kinds of suits
going through your office.

11
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:27,501
- I know you?
- Afraid not.

12
00:00:27,668 --> 00:00:31,881
- Yeah, yeah. You're McFadden.
- You've confused me with someone else.

13
00:00:32,048 --> 00:00:33,549
You were with the ambassador.

14
00:00:33,716 --> 00:00:37,261
You don't know me, I don't know you,
but it's your job to get me out.

15
00:00:37,428 --> 00:00:38,846
- We break out tomorrow.
- By 3.

16
00:00:39,013 --> 00:00:40,639
- You mean a.m.
- No, I mean p.m.

17
00:00:40,806 --> 00:00:43,059
We're doing this tomorrow,
during the day.

18
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:53,360
Give me the ring.

19
00:00:54,028 --> 00:00:55,780
Wise decision.

20
00:00:59,658 --> 00:01:00,993
You want the ring, brother?

21
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,621
It's more your style, man.

22
00:01:12,046 --> 00:01:15,216
Hey, hey, no, no.
It's all right, it's all right.

23
00:01:17,468 --> 00:01:19,929
You all go on back. Go ahead.

24
00:01:20,137 --> 00:01:21,680
No, go ahead.

25
00:01:23,891 --> 00:01:25,643
A word.

26
00:01:30,731 --> 00:01:32,817
You should try
and be careful in the future.

27
00:01:32,983 --> 00:01:34,735
Yes, sir.

28
00:01:54,213 --> 00:01:55,714
Hey.

29
00:01:56,298 --> 00:01:59,635
Hey. What's your name?

30
00:02:00,928 --> 00:02:03,639
- Tyge.
- Michael.

31
00:02:03,806 --> 00:02:07,518
The Australian, you said you
knew him from Nice. Is that true?

32
00:02:07,977 --> 00:02:09,395
You calling me a liar now?

33
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:13,482
He says you're full of it.
He says he was never an ambassador.

34
00:02:13,649 --> 00:02:17,194
Not an ambassador, the Ambassador.

35
00:02:17,361 --> 00:02:20,239
I was concierge
at the Ambassador Hotel.

36
00:02:20,614 --> 00:02:23,367
I could have sworn he worked there
for a few months.

37
00:02:24,451 --> 00:02:25,494
Heh.

38
00:02:25,661 --> 00:02:28,581
Who the hell knows, huh?
I was high half the time.

39
00:02:28,747 --> 00:02:31,000
Kind of why I got fired.

40
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:32,459
Kind of why I'm in here.

41
00:02:32,626 --> 00:02:34,211
What was he up to in Nice?

42
00:02:34,712 --> 00:02:37,339
What, you writing a book?

43
00:02:37,548 --> 00:02:40,342
13,
that gives us three hours.

44
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:42,052
We still don't have a way out.

45
00:02:42,219 --> 00:02:44,263
I'll take care of that.
I need to check it.

46
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,765
And the fence?
Your friend only sprayed it once.

47
00:02:46,932 --> 00:02:48,559
I don't want to get electrocuted.

48
00:02:48,726 --> 00:02:51,020
Would I feel better if he
sprayed it again? Yes.

49
00:02:51,186 --> 00:02:52,688
Is that an option? No.

50
00:02:52,855 --> 00:02:55,024
Unless he had
another reason to be there.

51
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,943
What are you gonna do?
Kill someone to get more spray?

52
00:02:58,152 --> 00:03:00,654
I'd think about killing you
if it helped us get out.

53
00:03:01,196 --> 00:03:03,741
You know what will help us
get out of here? A ladder.

54
00:03:03,907 --> 00:03:07,745
Michael, where are we gonna go
once we get through that fence?

55
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,414
Just get me a ladder.

56
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:18,881
- This hammock's shorter than the last.
- We might need something to extend it.

57
00:03:19,048 --> 00:03:20,883
All right, I'll take care of it.

58
00:03:21,091 --> 00:03:22,760
I've never been to Nice.

59
00:03:23,302 --> 00:03:26,013
- I hear it's beautiful.
- I wouldn't know.

60
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,973
I don't care if this guy knows you...

61
00:03:28,182 --> 00:03:31,727
...but what I do care about is his
apparent fixation with watching you.

62
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:37,608
We'll be out of here soon enough.
He won't be a problem.

63
00:03:37,858 --> 00:03:40,861
Scofield, you have a visitor.

64
00:03:47,076 --> 00:03:49,661
Hey, check it out.
They roll bones in your country?

65
00:03:50,204 --> 00:03:52,414
Come to my cell. I'll teach you.

66
00:03:52,581 --> 00:03:56,085
You want me to come back to your cell
and roll bones, hmm?

67
00:03:56,251 --> 00:03:57,336
Real subtle.

68
00:03:57,628 --> 00:03:58,921
Hardy-har-har. Heh-heh.

69
00:03:59,088 --> 00:04:00,464
Yeah, yeah, it's hilarious.

70
00:04:00,631 --> 00:04:03,926
Tell me, are you this friendly
with all the shirtless guys in Sona?

71
00:04:04,134 --> 00:04:06,845
I gave you food yesterday.
I gave you a place to sleep.

72
00:04:07,012 --> 00:04:08,764
I wonder why.

73
00:04:08,931 --> 00:04:10,891
- What the hell is your problem?
- Look...

74
00:04:11,058 --> 00:04:13,685
...I just don't wanna have sex
with you, okay?

75
00:04:15,562 --> 00:04:17,940
Is that so hard to believe?

76
00:04:30,452 --> 00:04:32,204
To make it across no man's land...

77
00:04:32,371 --> 00:04:34,748
...we're gonna have to disable
two of the tower guards.

78
00:04:34,915 --> 00:04:36,416
I've already taken care of one.

79
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:39,044
With the other one,
we're gonna need your help.

80
00:04:39,211 --> 00:04:42,464
Every day between 1 and 2,
he takes his lunch break, gets coffee.

81
00:04:42,631 --> 00:04:45,592
You need to find out where
and put something in that cup.

82
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,302
Make sure he's unconscious.

83
00:04:47,469 --> 00:04:50,013
You're dropping this on me
with three hours to go?

84
00:04:50,222 --> 00:04:52,516
- I don't know what to tell you.
- Three-thirteen?

85
00:04:52,683 --> 00:04:54,309
Three-thirteen is when it starts.

86
00:04:54,476 --> 00:04:57,437
- We'll be on the beach by 3:25.
- In broad daylight?

87
00:04:57,604 --> 00:04:59,606
The Company thinks
we're doing this at 9?

88
00:04:59,773 --> 00:05:02,609
Listen, I can't lie
to these people anymore, Michael.

89
00:05:02,776 --> 00:05:04,444
We need time to survey the site...

90
00:05:04,611 --> 00:05:08,448
...to figure if we can get L.J. and Sara
out of here in case they try something.

91
00:05:08,782 --> 00:05:10,617
- You got the gun?
- Yeah, I got the gun.

92
00:05:13,036 --> 00:05:14,788
How's L.J.? How's Sara?

93
00:05:14,955 --> 00:05:16,206
They're fine.

94
00:05:16,373 --> 00:05:18,542
What about the pictures?

95
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:20,043
I can't get pictures.

96
00:05:20,252 --> 00:05:22,838
- I need them, Linc.
- I can't get the pictures.

97
00:05:23,005 --> 00:05:24,423
How do we know they're alive?

98
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,509
- They're the reason I'm doing this.
- Susan says they're fine.

99
00:05:27,676 --> 00:05:30,387
You're the one who's telling me
we can't trust anybody...

100
00:05:30,554 --> 00:05:34,057
- ...now you're vouching for this person?
- There isn't enough time.

101
00:05:35,642 --> 00:05:41,273
Listen, if I don't see pictures of L.J.
and Sara by 2:30 this afternoon...

102
00:05:41,815 --> 00:05:43,901
...I'm not going anywhere.

103
00:06:33,617 --> 00:06:35,869
I can't seem to find
American cheese down here.

104
00:06:36,036 --> 00:06:38,246
I hope you like asadero.

105
00:06:38,413 --> 00:06:39,998
Yeah, this is perfect.

106
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:45,420
A couple of years ago,
I was serving in Mosul...

107
00:06:45,962 --> 00:06:48,256
...and I was taken prisoner.

108
00:06:48,423 --> 00:06:53,011
A few nights later, I could hear
the sound of U.S. Army helicopters.

109
00:06:53,178 --> 00:06:55,347
Two klicks and closing.

110
00:06:56,681 --> 00:07:00,102
My hands were still tied
behind my back and I ran.

111
00:07:00,268 --> 00:07:03,814
It didn't occur to me that
if this was a rescue mission...

112
00:07:04,564 --> 00:07:07,317
...my captors could hear the choppers.

113
00:07:07,692 --> 00:07:11,530
It didn't occur to me that this
was actually a hostage exchange.

114
00:07:13,156 --> 00:07:19,788
And that my jumping
would be viewed as a hostile act.

115
00:07:22,249 --> 00:07:25,001
I got recaptured immediately.

116
00:07:25,627 --> 00:07:29,673
Six Rangers died in the firefight.

117
00:07:30,882 --> 00:07:32,801
And for the next three weeks...

118
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:44,146
Let's just say, men are pigs.

119
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,569
Let's be clear.

120
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,905
This is an exchange.

121
00:07:54,489 --> 00:07:58,785
If you don't try to be a hero,
you and your father will be okay.

122
00:07:58,994 --> 00:08:00,787
- Okay?
- Okay.

123
00:08:01,121 --> 00:08:02,539
Good.

124
00:08:06,001 --> 00:08:07,460
Eat.

125
00:08:11,715 --> 00:08:13,884
Norman? Norman?

126
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:15,969
As you can imagine,
he prefers Lechero.

127
00:08:16,136 --> 00:08:17,345
Norman?

128
00:08:17,512 --> 00:08:20,015
He kill you before or after
he does your taxes?

129
00:08:21,975 --> 00:08:23,476
He kill you when he pleases.

130
00:08:24,769 --> 00:08:25,979
I'm feeling thirsty.

131
00:08:26,146 --> 00:08:28,440
Why don't you go
fix us something to drink, boy?

132
00:08:28,607 --> 00:08:32,861
Maybe you ain't got the memorandum,
but I've been promoted, boy.

133
00:08:36,531 --> 00:08:37,782
What you say to me?

134
00:08:38,533 --> 00:08:40,619
- Hmm?
- What's the problem?

135
00:08:40,785 --> 00:08:43,455
Stumpy here and his mouth,
that's the problem.

136
00:08:43,622 --> 00:08:45,081
I'm calling him out right now.

137
00:08:45,624 --> 00:08:48,543
I'll talk to him. Leave.

138
00:08:50,503 --> 00:08:51,630
This isn't over.

139
00:08:54,841 --> 00:08:56,468
Leave.

140
00:08:59,554 --> 00:09:01,806
- We were just, uh--
- No, no.

141
00:09:01,973 --> 00:09:04,309
The favor you owe me.
What have you found out?

142
00:09:04,851 --> 00:09:06,561
A thing like this takes time.

143
00:09:06,728 --> 00:09:08,271
I can't walk up to them and say:

144
00:09:08,438 --> 00:09:11,149
"Hey, whoever's been betraying Lechero,
raise your hand."

145
00:09:11,775 --> 00:09:15,278
I ask you to be my ears in this prison
and you hear nothing?

146
00:09:15,445 --> 00:09:18,365
Every time I try and sit down,
begin sussing things out...

147
00:09:18,531 --> 00:09:20,158
...Sammy changes the subject.

148
00:09:20,325 --> 00:09:24,704
- Not that I'm saying he's the guy--
- I don't want to hear your theories.

149
00:09:24,871 --> 00:09:26,956
I want results.

150
00:09:45,934 --> 00:09:47,894
Is everything okay? ls James all right?

151
00:09:48,061 --> 00:09:49,229
Yeah, he's fine.

152
00:09:49,979 --> 00:09:51,773
Where is this from?

153
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:55,652
Uribe's, the roadside bodega,
a few kilometers away.

154
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,988
If I needed you to ID a specific guard,
could you do it?

155
00:10:00,073 --> 00:10:01,574
I just don't wanna get busted.

156
00:10:01,741 --> 00:10:04,703
- Could you do it or not?
- Yes.

157
00:10:08,707 --> 00:10:10,041
- Lincoln?
- Yeah.

158
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,127
- What is it?
- I need something.

159
00:10:38,945 --> 00:10:40,989
Teodoro's harmless, man. He's a clown.

160
00:10:41,156 --> 00:10:42,449
He's a dead clown.

161
00:10:48,997 --> 00:10:51,791
Hey, man,
I wasn't gonna say anything...

162
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:55,628
...but, uh, last night,
I was looking for my playing cards...

163
00:10:55,795 --> 00:10:57,464
...and guess what...

164
00:10:58,298 --> 00:10:59,466
...I found these.

165
00:10:59,632 --> 00:11:00,925
You're holding out on me.

166
00:11:02,302 --> 00:11:03,595
Take them. They taste nasty.

167
00:11:03,803 --> 00:11:06,931
Man, you cannot get
a better cigar than these.

168
00:11:07,098 --> 00:11:08,766
Where did you get these? Augusto?

169
00:11:08,933 --> 00:11:10,894
I can't make him stop
sending them to me.

170
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,521
But I don't work for him,
you understand?

171
00:11:14,814 --> 00:11:15,982
You sure you don't mind?

172
00:11:50,808 --> 00:11:52,810
Uh, I was in the neighborhood.

173
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,608
You came all this way to visit?

174
00:11:59,275 --> 00:12:00,860
I came to get you out of here.

175
00:12:01,069 --> 00:12:04,656
I can have you in
Schaum Correctional Facility in 48 hours.

176
00:12:05,156 --> 00:12:06,658
In Saint Louis?

177
00:12:06,824 --> 00:12:10,745
Sullins wanted a medium security,
but, uh, I talked him down.

178
00:12:10,912 --> 00:12:12,580
What sort of deal is he getting me?

179
00:12:12,747 --> 00:12:14,958
Twenty-five years? Life?

180
00:12:15,124 --> 00:12:18,544
The director's giving us a lot of latitude
in exchange for testimony...

181
00:12:18,711 --> 00:12:21,589
...against the government
in the Lincoln Burrows conspiracy.

182
00:12:21,756 --> 00:12:25,468
So how does eight years sound?

183
00:12:27,053 --> 00:12:30,765
As soon as Sullins finishes up,
we can have a van ready--

184
00:12:30,974 --> 00:12:32,266
I don't think so.

185
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,352
What?

186
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:40,274
Well, I appreciate the effort, your effort,
but, um, I can't do eight years.

187
00:12:40,483 --> 00:12:42,652
You're doing 10 now.

188
00:12:43,319 --> 00:12:45,321
The government is calling in
some favors.

189
00:12:45,488 --> 00:12:47,949
Once you're in the U.S,
if you don't cooperate...

190
00:12:48,116 --> 00:12:51,994
...they'll charge you with everything.
That's multiple homicide counts.

191
00:12:55,957 --> 00:12:59,794
Without this deal, you are gonna be
in prison for the rest of your life.

192
00:13:02,004 --> 00:13:03,631
I appreciate the effort.

193
00:13:04,173 --> 00:13:05,717
Your effort.

194
00:13:05,883 --> 00:13:07,677
- Alex.
- I can't.

195
00:13:08,594 --> 00:13:09,679
Alex.

196
00:13:13,015 --> 00:13:18,271
While we're getting out of here,
um, if I don't make it...

197
00:13:18,438 --> 00:13:21,107
...can you make sure
this gets to my girlfriend?

198
00:13:23,818 --> 00:13:25,445
All right.

199
00:13:28,614 --> 00:13:31,701
You know, uh,
I could do the same for you--

200
00:13:31,909 --> 00:13:33,911
Tie an anchor bend there.

201
00:13:34,954 --> 00:13:36,205
I was just offering.

202
00:13:36,372 --> 00:13:39,834
If I'm the one who doesn't make it
and you really wanna do me a favor...

203
00:13:40,001 --> 00:13:41,961
...just hold up your end of the bargain.

204
00:13:42,795 --> 00:13:44,130
I'll do everything I can.

205
00:13:44,297 --> 00:13:45,840
I hope that's true.

206
00:13:46,424 --> 00:13:48,593
How's that knot coming?

207
00:13:49,719 --> 00:13:51,220
There.

208
00:13:52,013 --> 00:13:53,431
Did I pass your test?

209
00:13:54,265 --> 00:13:56,601
I told you, I'm a fisherman.

210
00:13:57,935 --> 00:13:58,978
Where are we?

211
00:13:59,145 --> 00:14:01,647
We found a cell that will get us
into no man's land.

212
00:14:01,814 --> 00:14:04,650
It's a longer run to the fence,
but it's gonna have to do.

213
00:14:04,817 --> 00:14:06,277
Which one? Who lives there?

214
00:14:06,861 --> 00:14:09,071
Papo, Cheo and Sammy.

215
00:14:09,238 --> 00:14:10,948
Look, I know what you're thinking.

216
00:14:11,115 --> 00:14:14,619
It's the only cell on the second floor
with a direct line to the fence...

217
00:14:14,785 --> 00:14:18,372
- ...where we won't be seen by guards.
- How do we know they won't be there?

218
00:14:18,581 --> 00:14:20,958
By 2:00 everyone should be
out in the courtyard...

219
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:22,793
...for the lunchtime soccer game.

220
00:14:23,586 --> 00:14:26,047
You sure it hasn't started already?

221
00:14:34,013 --> 00:14:36,849
Someone went outside the ring
to settle a dispute.

222
00:14:38,392 --> 00:14:41,854
Now, anyone who affronts
our justice system in this way...

223
00:14:42,021 --> 00:14:43,272
...must be punished.

224
00:14:44,023 --> 00:14:46,525
Now, I know the coward
won't come forward.

225
00:14:47,068 --> 00:14:50,529
But if anyone has information
about this shameful act...

226
00:14:51,239 --> 00:14:52,823
...I demand to know.

227
00:15:02,124 --> 00:15:03,626
- Let's go, Menudo.
- Why?

228
00:15:03,793 --> 00:15:06,545
Lechero wants you. Move your ass.

229
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,882
Every day I see you out in the yard.

230
00:15:10,049 --> 00:15:12,760
Play your American sports,
wear your American clothes.

231
00:15:12,927 --> 00:15:15,262
I don't think
I've heard you speak Spanish.

232
00:15:15,429 --> 00:15:17,306
- I like to practice my English.
- Ha, ha.

233
00:15:17,473 --> 00:15:18,599
And why shouldn't you?

234
00:15:18,808 --> 00:15:21,894
Huh? America is a great nation.

235
00:15:22,103 --> 00:15:25,982
One nation indivisible with liberty
and justice for all. Is that right?

236
00:15:26,857 --> 00:15:28,609
- Yes.
- Yes.

237
00:15:29,402 --> 00:15:31,070
Justice for all.

238
00:15:31,237 --> 00:15:34,281
Justice for you and justice for me.

239
00:15:36,033 --> 00:15:39,870
And justice for whoever killed
the blanquito in the yard.

240
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:44,000
Now, I know why you didn't say
anything out there.

241
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:46,919
But you play your silly American games
all day long...

242
00:15:47,086 --> 00:15:50,256
...right in front of the stairs
where the body was found.

243
00:15:51,257 --> 00:15:54,635
Now, if you don't tell me
what you saw...

244
00:15:55,428 --> 00:15:57,513
...there will be consequences.

245
00:16:02,893 --> 00:16:07,064
Well, I saw one person
go into the stairwell.

246
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:12,528
And then maybe a minute later
I heard an argument.

247
00:16:13,195 --> 00:16:14,780
Who did you see?

248
00:16:18,701 --> 00:16:21,078
So after we tie the cord off...

249
00:16:21,871 --> 00:16:24,749
...we dig out the bar,
we pop open the grate and we're down.

250
00:16:24,915 --> 00:16:28,461
Does anyone wanna say anything
about what we just saw out there?

251
00:16:29,211 --> 00:16:30,296
What is there to say?

252
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:33,883
You said we should kill someone
and then someone gets killed.

253
00:16:34,049 --> 00:16:37,011
I didn't say that.
This is what we should be focusing on.

254
00:16:37,178 --> 00:16:40,306
Let's spend a couple of hours worrying
about another dead body.

255
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:43,809
- What do you want?
- What are you doing?

256
00:16:43,976 --> 00:16:46,145
- Lechero wants you.
- I don't have information.

257
00:16:46,312 --> 00:16:48,814
He doesn't want information.
He wants a confession.

258
00:16:57,823 --> 00:17:01,202
- I didn't do anything.
- Listen to him, he's innocent.

259
00:17:01,785 --> 00:17:05,539
If you want to confess,
you can easily switch places.

260
00:17:09,543 --> 00:17:12,880
Maybe now we should start worrying
about who the real killer is, huh?

261
00:17:13,047 --> 00:17:16,592
Yeah, but in this place, there could be
a hundred people on that list.

262
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:20,554
Except I'm thinking a stab wound to
the base of the neck looks professional.

263
00:17:20,721 --> 00:17:22,056
I was in visitation, Kojak.

264
00:17:22,223 --> 00:17:24,600
What makes you so sure
that Whistler didn't do it?

265
00:17:24,767 --> 00:17:27,937
- He had the run-in with the guy.
- No, he's got too much to lose.

266
00:17:28,145 --> 00:17:31,065
Whistler's gone, if not now, soon,
so it's you and me--

267
00:17:31,232 --> 00:17:33,984
There is no you and me.
We're not leaving without him.

268
00:17:34,151 --> 00:17:36,487
In two hours,
I'm going through that fence.

269
00:17:36,654 --> 00:17:38,113
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, that's right.

270
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,533
- Where are you gonna go to?
- Anywhere but here.

271
00:17:40,741 --> 00:17:44,411
There's only one road out,
and the jungle's patrolled by police 24/7.

272
00:17:44,578 --> 00:17:46,288
So again, where are you gonna go?

273
00:17:46,455 --> 00:17:49,458
Three-thirteen, I'm gone.

274
00:17:54,463 --> 00:17:56,632
I told you, I know nothing about this.

275
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,301
I shouldn't-- I shouldn't be here.

276
00:17:59,468 --> 00:18:01,971
I can promise you, I--
I did not kill that man.

277
00:18:02,179 --> 00:18:04,056
Someone saw you
go down the staircase.

278
00:18:04,265 --> 00:18:06,433
Stairca--? ls there any other proof?

279
00:18:06,642 --> 00:18:09,478
- My men will find something.
- Do you see a weapon on me?

280
00:18:09,645 --> 00:18:11,647
I didn't expect to see
a weapon on you.

281
00:18:12,189 --> 00:18:14,900
Why not look for that?
Find that, you'll find the killer.

282
00:18:15,067 --> 00:18:18,445
- Maybe they'll find where you planted it.
- What, I'm framing someone?

283
00:18:18,612 --> 00:18:21,991
- Maybe someone's framing me.
- Who would bother?

284
00:18:22,157 --> 00:18:24,326
You know why I'm here.
I have powerful enemies.

285
00:18:24,493 --> 00:18:28,956
You think my judgment is swayed by
the mayor's friends? Sit your ass down.

286
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,333
When I was 13...

287
00:18:32,751 --> 00:18:35,629
...my mother worked for
a wealthy man as a maid.

288
00:18:35,963 --> 00:18:37,506
Until one day...

289
00:18:38,924 --> 00:18:44,430
...she was alone in the house
with him and he--

290
00:18:49,685 --> 00:18:51,729
Everybody knew what he did.

291
00:18:54,023 --> 00:18:55,774
But because he was rich...

292
00:18:55,941 --> 00:18:58,360
...and we were immigrants...

293
00:18:59,069 --> 00:19:01,780
...the police wouldn't even
take a report.

294
00:19:03,615 --> 00:19:08,078
So a week later,
to gain access through his gates...

295
00:19:08,746 --> 00:19:12,541
...I dressed as a milkman,
a lechero...

296
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:16,462
...and I made sure
that fair punishment was rendered.

297
00:19:17,796 --> 00:19:20,257
Now you want to tell me
how I favor the rich?

298
00:19:23,218 --> 00:19:25,387
I understand the rules here...

299
00:19:25,554 --> 00:19:27,473
...and I respect them.

300
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,476
But why the rush to judgment?

301
00:19:30,642 --> 00:19:34,980
Is there a rule saying you must convict
a suspect within 10 minutes?

302
00:19:38,192 --> 00:19:39,777
No.

303
00:19:43,655 --> 00:19:45,324
We have all the time in the world.

304
00:19:47,826 --> 00:19:51,038
Thank you.
Now, obviously, I'm not going anywhere.

305
00:19:51,205 --> 00:19:54,500
- If you need to talk, I'll be in my cell.
- No.

306
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:56,460
You'll be right here in this chair.

307
00:20:13,477 --> 00:20:15,020
What the hell do you want?

308
00:20:15,229 --> 00:20:16,855
I don't like you.

309
00:20:17,022 --> 00:20:20,484
- I certainly don't respect you.
- Stop, you're hurting my feelings.

310
00:20:20,651 --> 00:20:22,277
I've seen what you're capable of.

311
00:20:22,694 --> 00:20:25,656
But I gotta say,
I never pegged you as a murderer.

312
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,575
You think I killed Tyge?

313
00:20:28,742 --> 00:20:32,412
I saw the two of you
in the courtyard this morning.

314
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:35,040
I was trying to be nice to him.
He started with me.

315
00:20:35,207 --> 00:20:37,709
- If you didn't kill him, who did?
- Not me.

316
00:20:37,876 --> 00:20:40,796
Come on, Brad.
Who wanted him dead besides you?

317
00:20:40,963 --> 00:20:44,967
You think I killed that frog? How many
times have I had you at gunpoint?

318
00:20:45,133 --> 00:20:47,928
You think I didn't wanna
pull that trigger?

319
00:20:51,181 --> 00:20:56,061
Hell, I can't even kill myself.

320
00:21:05,445 --> 00:21:08,365
Hey, you seen anyone see Whistler
go down the stairway?

321
00:21:08,532 --> 00:21:10,075
We only been out here a minute.

322
00:21:10,242 --> 00:21:11,326
Well, hurry up then.

323
00:21:11,493 --> 00:21:15,455
The sooner Whistler dies,
the sooner I give you the chicken foot.

324
00:21:15,622 --> 00:21:18,083
Or if you prefer,
you can give me the chicken foot.

325
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,377
You know, try and go out like a man.

326
00:21:20,544 --> 00:21:24,298
Either way, you're getting
in the ring with me today.

327
00:21:32,764 --> 00:21:35,809
Zylafol.
It's used to anesthetize dogs.

328
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:39,187
Two drops and the guard
should be out within an hour.

329
00:21:39,563 --> 00:21:41,773
I was expecting Whistler's girlfriend
to join you.

330
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,735
- Where is she, around the corner?
- She came to me.

331
00:21:44,901 --> 00:21:48,030
I don't mind that she's helping.
I mind that you kept it from me.

332
00:21:48,405 --> 00:21:50,741
What difference does it make?
We're done by tomorrow.

333
00:21:50,907 --> 00:21:52,409
No more surprises, Lincoln.

334
00:21:54,703 --> 00:21:58,415
- What? Say it.
- Can you get any more pictures of Sara?

335
00:21:58,582 --> 00:22:00,834
Alive? No.

336
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,172
You didn't tell him.

337
00:22:05,338 --> 00:22:07,632
You didn't tell Michael
that Sara's dead.

338
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,135
Can we get pictures or not?

339
00:22:10,677 --> 00:22:12,763
I'm sure we can cobble
something together...

340
00:22:12,929 --> 00:22:15,265
...but smart move
not telling your brother.

341
00:22:15,432 --> 00:22:17,142
He seems a little sensitive to me.

342
00:22:19,227 --> 00:22:20,604
This is the exchange point.

343
00:22:20,771 --> 00:22:23,273
L.J. and I will be waiting.
You will meet us there.

344
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,943
Everything goes as planned,
you'll have your son back by 9:00.

345
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:28,945
Lincoln?

346
00:22:29,112 --> 00:22:30,197
Nine o'clock.

347
00:22:46,088 --> 00:22:47,172
Which one is it?

348
00:22:47,339 --> 00:22:50,258
I think the taller one.
The other always drinks orange juice.

349
00:22:50,425 --> 00:22:52,844
- You sure?
- I think so, but they look the same--

350
00:22:53,011 --> 00:22:54,095
Hey.

351
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:24,876
- Oh.
- Hey.

352
00:23:25,043 --> 00:23:26,419
Watch where you're going.

353
00:23:26,628 --> 00:23:28,255
Hey, look, uh, this is a buddy's.

354
00:23:28,421 --> 00:23:30,549
Please. Please, I insist.

355
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:34,845
No, really.

356
00:23:40,475 --> 00:23:42,060
Thank you, anyway.

357
00:23:42,227 --> 00:23:44,437
Excuse me, señor.
I just need to go to Sona.

358
00:23:44,604 --> 00:23:46,773
I-- And my car's run out of gas, and--

359
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:49,609
I'm sorry, I'm heading
in the wrong direction. I'm--

360
00:23:49,776 --> 00:23:51,278
I really need to go to Sona.

361
00:23:55,156 --> 00:23:56,241
Thank you.

362
00:23:59,869 --> 00:24:00,954
Watch the lid.

363
00:24:16,177 --> 00:24:18,305
My condolences.

364
00:24:18,471 --> 00:24:21,266
You finally make a friend
and now he's about to die.

365
00:24:21,433 --> 00:24:25,103
Damn shame.
You can stop it, you know.

366
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:29,858
If you hadn't noticed,
my position enables me to hear things.

367
00:24:33,153 --> 00:24:34,571
I'm listening.

368
00:24:34,738 --> 00:24:38,241
The only proof Lechero's got
is that your man went down the stairs.

369
00:24:38,408 --> 00:24:40,994
- What if you had more evidence?
- Well, I don't.

370
00:24:41,202 --> 00:24:42,287
But if you did?

371
00:24:42,495 --> 00:24:44,331
Are you suggesting
I make something up?

372
00:24:44,497 --> 00:24:47,208
Blame it on somebody
who deserves it.

373
00:24:47,375 --> 00:24:49,377
Someone who's killed
and gone unpunished.

374
00:24:49,544 --> 00:24:51,504
Yeah, like you, maybe.

375
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:54,090
Sammy.

376
00:24:57,052 --> 00:24:59,971
You want me to tell Lechero
his right-hand man should die?

377
00:25:01,348 --> 00:25:04,100
You don't tell Lechero squat.

378
00:25:04,684 --> 00:25:07,354
Lechero knows this is Sammy's ring.

379
00:25:07,562 --> 00:25:09,939
If you drop it in the blood
by the staircase...

380
00:25:10,106 --> 00:25:12,192
...then yell up to Lechero
what you found...

381
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:16,738
...the whole entire prison will hear
clear-cut evidence of Sammy's guilt.

382
00:25:16,905 --> 00:25:20,283
Lechero will have no choice
but to comply.

383
00:25:25,789 --> 00:25:30,293
This is Sona. Don't worry
your pretty little head about it.

384
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:34,130
All you have to do is drop the ring
in the blood and say it was Sammy.

385
00:25:34,297 --> 00:25:36,549
I'll take care of the rest.

386
00:25:39,636 --> 00:25:41,346
You wanna save your friend's life?

387
00:25:42,222 --> 00:25:44,682
Someone else has to die.

388
00:26:34,065 --> 00:26:36,234
Explain your disagreement
with the Tyge-man.

389
00:26:36,401 --> 00:26:39,320
From what I heard,
he knew something about you.

390
00:26:39,487 --> 00:26:41,322
He thought he knew
something about me.

391
00:26:41,489 --> 00:26:44,075
Opportunity and motive.
That's not a good combination.

392
00:26:44,242 --> 00:26:47,453
There's discontent from many
of the prisoners over how you run Sona.

393
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:50,665
Now would not be a good time
to insult me.

394
00:26:50,832 --> 00:26:52,792
No. No, no, my point is this.

395
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:56,087
You execute me, get swift justice,
and you may placate the masses.

396
00:26:56,254 --> 00:27:00,216
But when they find out who really did it,
they'll know you killed an innocent man.

397
00:27:00,425 --> 00:27:03,678
You're still not answering my question.
What was your disagreement?

398
00:27:03,845 --> 00:27:05,888
He was a nosy guy,
he got into my business.

399
00:27:06,055 --> 00:27:08,808
I'm sure he did the same
with someone else.

400
00:27:08,975 --> 00:27:11,561
- Just admit that you had an argument.
- This is prison.

401
00:27:11,728 --> 00:27:14,939
If someone makes accusations,
I can't back down. Respect that.

402
00:27:15,106 --> 00:27:16,941
I answered your questions.

403
00:27:17,442 --> 00:27:21,738
I've acquitted myself the best that I can.
What can I do to make you trust me?

404
00:27:24,866 --> 00:27:27,285
I don't trust anybody today.

405
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,284
Heh.

406
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:47,865
- Yeah?
- We have the picture.

407
00:28:48,032 --> 00:28:50,535
- How does it look?
- It looks like Sara.

408
00:28:51,994 --> 00:28:55,289
I'll be at Sona in a half hour.
Meet me in the parking lot.

409
00:28:55,456 --> 00:28:56,666
Is everything okay?

410
00:28:56,874 --> 00:28:58,126
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

411
00:29:08,761 --> 00:29:11,013
Norman? Norman St. John?

412
00:29:36,789 --> 00:29:38,040
I'm waiting.

413
00:29:38,249 --> 00:29:40,501
There was a complication
with the guard.

414
00:29:40,668 --> 00:29:44,213
- Complications drugging the guard?
- Yeah, but it's been taken care of.

415
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,719
Why are you drugging the guard now
when you're escaping tonight?

416
00:29:49,886 --> 00:29:54,307
- It takes that long for the drugs to work.
- They take an hour like I told you.

417
00:30:01,105 --> 00:30:02,857
Alex.

418
00:30:31,552 --> 00:30:33,888
You're getting sloppy, Alex.

419
00:30:34,055 --> 00:30:36,057
What are you talking about?

420
00:30:37,767 --> 00:30:40,770
- Is this a joke?
- I stopped hiding things a long time ago.

421
00:30:40,936 --> 00:30:43,439
Found that under my mattress?
Somebody put it there.

422
00:30:43,648 --> 00:30:45,274
Oh. You're gonna have to do better.

423
00:30:45,441 --> 00:30:48,152
Did you find some fingerprints?
Huh? Did you get some fibers?

424
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:50,112
Gonna take it to the Sona crime lab?

425
00:30:50,321 --> 00:30:52,782
They got Whistler for being
in the wrong stairwell.

426
00:30:52,948 --> 00:30:55,242
This is enough to get you guys
to switch places.

427
00:30:55,409 --> 00:30:56,661
You know what I mean?

428
00:30:56,869 --> 00:30:58,954
- What does that prove?
- Everything.

429
00:30:59,163 --> 00:31:01,999
- Gonna make sure Lechero thinks so too.
- Michael.

430
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:05,795
Michael, I did not kill that man.
I did not kill the man.

431
00:31:13,844 --> 00:31:16,013
What's--? What's going on?

432
00:31:16,639 --> 00:31:18,224
Is everything okay?

433
00:31:20,684 --> 00:31:22,937
What the hell are you doing? Huh?

434
00:31:23,145 --> 00:31:24,605
What's that for?

435
00:31:24,772 --> 00:31:26,857
Your father tried to be a hero.

436
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:31,278
No, no. Hey, please, please, please.

437
00:31:31,529 --> 00:31:33,280
Please. No, stop. Stop.

438
00:31:33,447 --> 00:31:36,700
Once I cut the spinal cord,
you won't feel a thing.

439
00:31:36,909 --> 00:31:38,869
No, no, no.

440
00:31:40,246 --> 00:31:42,832
No, no, no.

441
00:31:45,543 --> 00:31:48,504
Susan, I'm sorry.
We didn't mean to do that.

442
00:31:48,712 --> 00:31:50,381
Dad, they're gonna kill me.

443
00:31:50,589 --> 00:31:51,715
What? L.J.

444
00:31:51,924 --> 00:31:53,467
They got a knife at my throat.

445
00:31:54,009 --> 00:31:55,386
- L.J.!
- Dad--

446
00:31:55,553 --> 00:31:57,388
- Don't you hurt him!
- The truth.

447
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:59,306
The truth.

448
00:32:01,725 --> 00:32:03,894
Michael's getting out at 3:13.

449
00:32:04,061 --> 00:32:05,855
We're meeting him at 3:45.

450
00:32:06,021 --> 00:32:09,441
Susan, we did this because we wanted
to make sure the site was safe.

451
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:11,902
That's it.
That's the reason why we did it.

452
00:32:12,111 --> 00:32:15,447
Sounds to me like you're planning
another end around. Another rescue.

453
00:32:15,614 --> 00:32:20,202
No, no. We're not. We're not planning--
We're not planning another end around.

454
00:32:20,369 --> 00:32:24,456
No. Please, just let my son go.
Leave my son...

455
00:32:34,967 --> 00:32:36,177
Come on.

456
00:32:46,145 --> 00:32:47,354
Wow.

457
00:32:48,439 --> 00:32:50,649
Living the good life, huh?

458
00:32:51,317 --> 00:32:53,277
Is that what this is?

459
00:32:53,444 --> 00:32:57,281
Having too good a time here
to contemplate leaving?

460
00:32:58,824 --> 00:33:00,534
I needed some time to think.

461
00:33:00,701 --> 00:33:03,996
I needed some time to finalize
our agreement with the Panamanians...

462
00:33:04,163 --> 00:33:06,123
...but instead,
I get dragged down here.

463
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:09,627
Yeah, I'm sure it was really hard
to convince you to come down here.

464
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,963
I'm gonna be honest.

465
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,925
I was looking forward
to seeing you like this.

466
00:33:16,091 --> 00:33:20,095
But now that I'm here,
I, uh, wouldn't wish this on anyone.

467
00:33:22,681 --> 00:33:24,725
Can we save this
till after he's processed?

468
00:33:24,892 --> 00:33:26,936
I don't know.
Have you made up your mind?

469
00:33:27,311 --> 00:33:29,396
Eight years, minimum security?

470
00:33:29,563 --> 00:33:30,856
I got them down to four.

471
00:33:31,607 --> 00:33:33,025
I leave for the U.S. tonight?

472
00:33:33,192 --> 00:33:35,361
Once the special prosecutor
clears you...

473
00:33:35,527 --> 00:33:37,529
- ...you'll be on your way.
- Whoa, whoa.

474
00:33:37,696 --> 00:33:39,323
What about a special prosecutor?

475
00:33:39,531 --> 00:33:41,784
You stand in front of a guy,
tell your story...

476
00:33:41,951 --> 00:33:44,453
...he determines if you're gonna be
a useful witness.

477
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,121
It's a formality.

478
00:33:46,288 --> 00:33:47,665
It's a formality?

479
00:33:47,831 --> 00:33:49,249
It's just a formality?

480
00:33:49,458 --> 00:33:54,254
If it were up to me, you could rot in here
for the rest of your life.

481
00:33:54,421 --> 00:33:57,925
But the Justice Department is extremely
motivated to get to the bottom...

482
00:33:58,133 --> 00:34:00,260
...of this President Reynolds business.

483
00:34:01,095 --> 00:34:03,430
Alex, this is 100 percent above board.

484
00:34:03,597 --> 00:34:06,600
You've made a lot of mistakes
in your career. You and I know it.

485
00:34:06,767 --> 00:34:08,143
Intentional or otherwise.

486
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:12,106
I've got eight files
in my office attesting to that.

487
00:34:12,314 --> 00:34:14,483
And if you don't take this offer...

488
00:34:14,692 --> 00:34:18,570
...then I assure you, it would be
the biggest mistake of your life.

489
00:34:25,911 --> 00:34:27,913
- I know who killed that man.
- Sure you do.

490
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,665
Lechero.

491
00:34:34,378 --> 00:34:38,882
- What do we have here?
- I found this in Alexander Mahone's cell.

492
00:34:59,027 --> 00:35:03,282
Convenient to blame this on a man
who can't even be questioned.

493
00:35:03,991 --> 00:35:05,826
Enough of this already. Cheo.

494
00:35:08,745 --> 00:35:11,290
Get the prisoner up. It's time.

495
00:35:25,804 --> 00:35:29,099
- You know Whistler didn't do this.
- He found the shank in Mahone's cell.

496
00:35:29,266 --> 00:35:32,019
- Doesn't that prove I'm innocent?
- You're a joke.

497
00:35:32,186 --> 00:35:35,606
You talk about equality, but at
the end of the day you're a dictator.

498
00:35:35,772 --> 00:35:38,859
Just like any dictator,
you're terrified of losing your power.

499
00:35:39,026 --> 00:35:40,652
Be very unwise to go any further.

500
00:35:40,819 --> 00:35:44,031
You don't care who the killer is,
just as long as you get somebody.

501
00:35:44,198 --> 00:35:45,365
That's all that matters.

502
00:35:45,532 --> 00:35:48,285
I've determined who's guilty
and the punishment is death.

503
00:35:48,452 --> 00:35:51,205
You're making a mistake,
this is murder. You know it.

504
00:35:51,371 --> 00:35:54,625
- At least have the guts to admit it.
- You're right.

505
00:35:54,791 --> 00:35:55,876
It's murder.

506
00:35:59,463 --> 00:36:00,714
Don't!

507
00:36:16,855 --> 00:36:18,357
I found this in the yard.

508
00:36:21,568 --> 00:36:23,862
Augusto used to give them
to me as tribute.

509
00:36:24,237 --> 00:36:26,531
And now you reek of them.

510
00:36:37,709 --> 00:36:38,794
Go.

511
00:37:39,271 --> 00:37:41,690
He will be okay.

512
00:37:58,749 --> 00:38:01,042
I question your love for your son.

513
00:38:01,251 --> 00:38:05,172
He was two seconds away
from being decapitated because of you.

514
00:38:05,338 --> 00:38:08,216
- I told you the truth.
- Maybe.

515
00:38:08,383 --> 00:38:10,927
If you have anything else planned,
now it's scrapped.

516
00:38:11,094 --> 00:38:13,388
Because what happens
if you try something?

517
00:38:14,931 --> 00:38:17,476
- I know.
- Oh, good.

518
00:38:24,524 --> 00:38:26,568
This is the same newspaper
as the last one.

519
00:38:26,735 --> 00:38:29,529
That's what my guy could get.
He didn't give me much time.

520
00:38:29,696 --> 00:38:32,699
- You think Michael's not gonna notice?
- Yeah.

521
00:38:32,866 --> 00:38:36,161
- Hey, Michael, here's the pictures.
- He'll wanna see this close-up.

522
00:38:36,328 --> 00:38:39,122
I'm done doing favors for you.
Get out.

523
00:38:39,331 --> 00:38:41,208
I'll see you in an hour.

524
00:39:06,816 --> 00:39:08,318
No football today?

525
00:39:08,485 --> 00:39:10,987
No, no football today.

526
00:39:15,617 --> 00:39:17,035
You my brother, Sammy?

527
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:21,915
Of course.

528
00:39:43,478 --> 00:39:44,604
It's done?

529
00:39:44,813 --> 00:39:46,564
Guard will be asleep in a half hour.

530
00:39:46,731 --> 00:39:47,983
So we're good?

531
00:39:48,149 --> 00:39:49,818
Not quite.

532
00:39:50,485 --> 00:39:53,238
They, uh-- They know
we're breaking out this afternoon.

533
00:39:56,533 --> 00:39:58,910
- You told her?
- Man, she worked it out.

534
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:00,996
- Why didn't you lie?
- She worked it out.

535
00:40:01,204 --> 00:40:03,707
So, what are we gonna do
to get the upper hand?

536
00:40:03,873 --> 00:40:06,334
- Nothing.
- Think they're gonna turn them over?

537
00:40:06,501 --> 00:40:09,921
- This is too dangerous. We try anything--
- What, hurt them?

538
00:40:11,548 --> 00:40:14,801
Not if they want us to deliver
on Whistler, they won't.

539
00:40:15,176 --> 00:40:19,514
We're playing this one straight.
No games, no surprises, all right?

540
00:40:20,974 --> 00:40:22,100
Show me the pictures.

541
00:40:26,062 --> 00:40:27,397
Show me the pictures, Linc.

542
00:40:30,233 --> 00:40:31,526
The pictures.

543
00:40:31,693 --> 00:40:33,903
I can't show you the pictures, man.

544
00:40:35,238 --> 00:40:36,531
I, uh...

545
00:40:37,991 --> 00:40:39,743
Why not, Linc?

546
00:40:47,917 --> 00:40:49,586
She's dead, Michael.

547
00:40:54,674 --> 00:40:56,092
I lied to you.

548
00:40:56,259 --> 00:40:57,927
I'm sorry.

549
00:40:58,803 --> 00:41:01,848
If you don't break out today,
they're gonna kill my son.

550
00:41:02,098 --> 00:41:04,142
They're gonna kill L.J.

551
00:41:05,018 --> 00:41:06,728
Michael, we gotta do this.

552
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:08,855
Michael, we gotta do this!

553
00:41:09,397 --> 00:41:11,191
Michael!

554
00:42:18,675 --> 00:42:20,009
Sara's dead.

555
00:42:23,304 --> 00:42:25,139
They killed her.

556
00:42:27,892 --> 00:42:29,894
Man, I'm so sorry.

557
00:42:32,563 --> 00:42:37,026
I loved her and now she's gone.

558
00:42:38,152 --> 00:42:40,280
And it's all because of you.

559
00:42:40,822 --> 00:42:42,031
What?

560
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,702
Hey, take it easy.

561
00:42:51,541 --> 00:42:52,917
Wh--? What?

562
00:42:53,251 --> 00:42:54,502
This is your fault.

563
00:42:54,669 --> 00:42:55,712
Huh?

564
00:42:55,878 --> 00:42:57,130
He's told me his grievance.

565
00:42:57,797 --> 00:42:59,340
This fight is gonna happen.

566
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,552
Just think about what you're doing.

567
00:43:03,136 --> 00:43:04,971
I have.
