1
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:54,911
Should get him to put
another egg in it.

2
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,009
Roger.

3
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:57,987
Darling, one egg is good.
Two eggs are better.

4
00:00:59,258 --> 00:01:01,158
Tell the, uh, lieutenant, please,

5
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,286
that things are getting a little dry
around Hill 29.

6
00:01:04,396 --> 00:01:05,294
Am I wrong?

7
00:01:05,397 --> 00:01:06,921
All clear in No Man's Land.

8
00:01:07,032 --> 00:01:07,930
Betty?

9
00:01:08,033 --> 00:01:10,729
Roger, you've expressed
your desire for another drink.

10
00:01:10,836 --> 00:01:12,303
No need to take the orders.

11
00:01:12,404 --> 00:01:13,428
Right away, sir.

12
00:01:13,539 --> 00:01:14,437
Wine list,

13
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:18,271
and I'll have another one of these
while I'm waiting for the list.

14
00:01:18,377 --> 00:01:19,867
Another egg.

15
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:21,537
Well, I am having fried chicken.

16
00:01:21,647 --> 00:01:23,444
As long as the egg comes first.

17
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:25,949
My nanny, Belva, made fried chicken.

18
00:01:26,051 --> 00:01:28,611
I used to take it to school
wrapped in wax paper.

19
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:30,279
His sweet Belvedere.

20
00:01:30,389 --> 00:01:31,686
He really loved that woman.

21
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:33,782
Had another nanny
originally. German girl.

22
00:01:33,893 --> 00:01:36,589
Round face, enormous bosom.

23
00:01:36,695 --> 00:01:39,255
My parents got rid of her
after the Lindbergh baby.

24
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:40,923
We thought about getting a nanny.

25
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:42,728
We have a girl that comes in

26
00:01:42,835 --> 00:01:45,963
who's sort of a housekeeper
and sometimes babysitter.

27
00:01:46,071 --> 00:01:50,132
I'd let her take the children to play group,
sometimes the park.

28
00:01:50,242 --> 00:01:51,300
Belva raised me.

29
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:52,672
I turned out just fine.

30
00:01:52,778 --> 00:01:55,508
Didn't have to go to a psychiatrist
like some people's kids.

31
00:01:55,614 --> 00:01:57,206
Oh, what's the big deal?

32
00:01:57,316 --> 00:02:00,376
Margaret is practically the last girl
in our building to go.

33
00:02:00,486 --> 00:02:02,784
16 years old, wouldn't get out of bed.

34
00:02:02,888 --> 00:02:06,756
I tell you, I cannot wait until that girl
is another man's problem.

35
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:07,951
What about you, Don?

36
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,392
Did you have a nanny?

37
00:02:10,496 --> 00:02:12,191
I can't tell you about my childhood.

38
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,289
It would ruin the first half of my novel.

39
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,459
Don doesn't like to talk about himself.

40
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,036
I know better than to ask.

41
00:02:18,137 --> 00:02:20,162
An ad man who doesn't like
to talk about himself?

42
00:02:20,272 --> 00:02:21,637
I think I may cry.

43
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,436
It's not that interesting a story.

44
00:02:24,543 --> 00:02:27,637
Just think of me as Moses.

45
00:02:27,746 --> 00:02:29,577
I was a baby in a basket.

46
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:33,812
To Moses and Don Draper:
A couple of princes.

47
00:02:36,822 --> 00:02:39,347
If the gentlemen will be patient.

48
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:40,823
I'll join you.

49
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:54,099
I think I may know more about your wife
than I do about my own.

50
00:02:54,206 --> 00:02:55,969
Maybe your wife is just a better drinker.

51
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:57,770
Entirely possible.

52
00:03:12,591 --> 00:03:13,785
Mona, could you help me here?

53
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:17,124
I seem to have grown a set of thumbs.

54
00:03:17,229 --> 00:03:20,198
Do you ever have that
when your hands go numb?

55
00:03:22,134 --> 00:03:24,227
You want me to touch you up?

56
00:03:24,336 --> 00:03:26,668
Yeah, I think you'll have to.

57
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:30,904
Look at those lips.

58
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:35,208
I'll bet it's not hard for you
to hold on to a man like that.

59
00:03:36,348 --> 00:03:37,781
Don't smile. It'll make it harder.

60
00:03:40,786 --> 00:03:44,483
It's hard to hold on to anything
right now with the... children

61
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,353
and running the house and...

62
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:47,618
I don't know if I told you,

63
00:03:47,726 --> 00:03:51,162
but my m-mother died two, three months ago.

64
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:54,126
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:57,691
There are other ladies
waiting to use the mirror.

66
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:08,676
Those purses get any smaller,
we're gonna starve.

67
00:04:14,753 --> 00:04:17,620
I love seeing you like that.

68
00:04:17,723 --> 00:04:20,692
Well, you were sitting on my good side.

69
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:25,594
No. I mean, the way
other people see you.

70
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:28,292
When you're with strangers,
you know exactly what you want.

71
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,961
Well, I like to think
I always know what I want.

72
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:34,801
Slow down.

73
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:36,875
I'll have to put that in my diary:

74
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:39,945
Lobster Newburg and gimlets
should get a divorce.

75
00:04:40,045 --> 00:04:42,445
They're not getting along very well.

76
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:44,243
Once you rounded the corner
on number two,

77
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,147
I took it for a case of nerves.

78
00:04:46,251 --> 00:04:49,186
He's your boss.

79
00:04:49,288 --> 00:04:51,722
He likes you.

80
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:55,260
Toots Shor means he likes me.

81
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:57,192
When he gets us to the Four Seasons,

82
00:04:57,296 --> 00:04:59,389
then we'll know he trusts me.

83
00:04:59,498 --> 00:05:02,365
Hmm. He seemed very forthcoming.

84
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:05,494
Yeah. When he's stoned on martinis.

85
00:05:05,604 --> 00:05:07,799
I don't know.

86
00:05:07,906 --> 00:05:09,965
It all seemed like an invitation to you

87
00:05:10,075 --> 00:05:13,533
to con... confide.

88
00:05:13,645 --> 00:05:15,977
Well, maybe it's just manners,

89
00:05:16,081 --> 00:05:19,448
but I was raised to see it
as a sin of pride

90
00:05:19,551 --> 00:05:22,076
to go on like that about yourself.

91
00:05:22,187 --> 00:05:24,178
You're so reverent.

92
00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:39,830
Did you have a nanny?

93
00:05:39,938 --> 00:05:41,428
I've never asked you that.

94
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,873
Why? What difference does it make?

95
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:47,502
I don't know.
We've never talked about it.

96
00:05:48,914 --> 00:05:50,142
Did you?

97
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:54,375
No, of course not.

98
00:05:55,921 --> 00:06:00,620
So your mother and father
are responsible for all this?

99
00:06:00,726 --> 00:06:03,092
I'll have to thank them someday.

100
00:06:03,195 --> 00:06:05,026
Jesus, Bets.

101
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:10,227
It's like politics, religion, or sex.

102
00:06:10,335 --> 00:06:12,132
Why talk about it?

103
00:06:15,674 --> 00:06:17,266
I see your point.

104
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:45,764
Who is in there?

105
00:06:55,447 --> 00:06:59,042
Peggy, next step is accessories.

106
00:06:59,151 --> 00:07:03,281
$35 a week, minus 6.75 for FICA.

107
00:07:03,388 --> 00:07:04,548
Can you believe it?

108
00:07:04,656 --> 00:07:07,682
Maybe it's the fumes
from the rubber cement on that envelope,

109
00:07:07,793 --> 00:07:09,761
but there's nothing to be happy about here,

110
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:12,626
although you never forget your first.

111
00:07:12,731 --> 00:07:16,132
For two weeks I've been telling people
I have a job in Manhattan.

112
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:18,829
Look at you. You're indomitable.

113
00:07:18,937 --> 00:07:21,735
You'd never know you were the very bottom
of the food chain.

114
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:26,535
Bridget? Are you okay?

115
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,949
Thanks to the Precision Valve Corporation,

116
00:07:34,052 --> 00:07:35,246
for the next 18 months,

117
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:39,120
Gillette is the only company on Earth
that can spray deodorant out of a can.

118
00:07:39,224 --> 00:07:42,318
Modern deodorant for a modern man.

119
00:07:42,427 --> 00:07:44,759
He prefers jet travel to train travel,

120
00:07:44,863 --> 00:07:46,455
vodka to Scotch,

121
00:07:46,565 --> 00:07:49,659
and he likes to get his news
from the radio, not the paper.

122
00:07:49,768 --> 00:07:50,826
Harold Hill, give it a rest.

123
00:07:50,936 --> 00:07:53,029
"Do not puncture or incinerate. "

124
00:07:53,138 --> 00:07:54,400
Sounds dangerous.

125
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:58,406
Hey, I got a dud.

126
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,478
How is it a guy as big as you, Ken,

127
00:08:03,582 --> 00:08:05,413
has no basketball skills?

128
00:08:05,517 --> 00:08:08,281
I'm sure more research is needed.

129
00:08:09,521 --> 00:08:11,546
We should try it out.

130
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,352
Who smells bad in here?

131
00:08:14,993 --> 00:08:16,324
Oh, no. Come on.

132
00:08:16,428 --> 00:08:18,055
- Come on, Kenny.
- Knock it off!

133
00:08:18,163 --> 00:08:19,653
Just pretend it's prom night.

134
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:20,891
You can be the girl.

135
00:08:20,999 --> 00:08:21,897
Stop!

136
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,932
Engage rockets.

137
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:23,933
All right, close your eyes.

138
00:08:27,272 --> 00:08:29,263
Mr. Draper, I was buzzing you.

139
00:08:29,374 --> 00:08:31,103
Mr. Cooper is waiting.

140
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,373
I always thought it was Sterling

141
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,471
who was responsible
for the Navy attitude around this place.

142
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:38,607
Brassiere account.

143
00:08:38,717 --> 00:08:41,709
Just figured out
we can't sell them to men.

144
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,586
So much yarn, so little time.

145
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:53,964
So Roger mentioned this Nixon thing.

146
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:55,328
Yeah, he mentioned it.

147
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:56,799
I just assumed it went away.

148
00:08:56,902 --> 00:08:58,665
It didn't.

149
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:01,204
Last I read, Nixon was
running without an agency.

150
00:09:01,306 --> 00:09:02,967
Make no mistake, we know better

151
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:06,476
what Dick Nixon needs
better than Dick Nixon.

152
00:09:06,578 --> 00:09:08,102
What does Dick Nixon think he needs?

153
00:09:08,213 --> 00:09:10,477
What he already has: Ted Rogers,

154
00:09:10,582 --> 00:09:12,914
the brains behind that Checkers broadcast.

155
00:09:13,018 --> 00:09:14,144
See the problem?

156
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:15,845
He dodged a financial scandal

157
00:09:15,954 --> 00:09:18,320
by standing with his wife
and begging for his dog.

158
00:09:18,423 --> 00:09:19,720
An admission wrapped in a distraction.

159
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:20,985
I'd say they know what they're doing.

160
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:22,185
Dogs are winners.

161
00:09:22,294 --> 00:09:23,420
Well, they think they're set without us.

162
00:09:23,528 --> 00:09:25,189
Why chase a girl who doesn't
want to get caught?

163
00:09:25,297 --> 00:09:26,821
You have a problem with Nixon?

164
00:09:26,932 --> 00:09:28,058
I don't vote.

165
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:30,464
Hear, hear.

166
00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:31,695
But politics aside,

167
00:09:31,803 --> 00:09:33,498
these last eight years have been good to us

168
00:09:33,605 --> 00:09:35,573
because they've been good
to Proctor & Gamble

169
00:09:35,674 --> 00:09:38,438
and The United Fruit Company,
et cetera.

170
00:09:38,543 --> 00:09:39,942
So whether Dick Nixon likes it or not...

171
00:09:40,045 --> 00:09:44,379
We will give our people
what they want, agreed?

172
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:46,246
I said cut it out!

173
00:09:46,351 --> 00:09:47,409
Be my pleasure.

174
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,111
Goodie.

175
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:52,655
Assemble a team.

176
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,157
Start files on contenders:

177
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:55,317
Symington, Kennedy...

178
00:09:55,427 --> 00:09:59,295
Who knows? Maybe Eleanor Roosevelt
will throw her feedbag into the ring.

179
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:00,729
Don, you still on for lunch?

180
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,767
No.

181
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,071
Don't tell me that's lunch.

182
00:10:10,175 --> 00:10:12,109
I've got a lot of work to catch up on.

183
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,234
I do that sometimes.

184
00:10:13,345 --> 00:10:15,108
Saunter over to the pie cart.

185
00:10:15,213 --> 00:10:17,181
Egg salad and the worst
cup of coffee in the world.

186
00:10:17,282 --> 00:10:18,180
35 cents.

187
00:10:18,283 --> 00:10:20,148
I've been meaning to try it.

188
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:22,948
It's okay if you like ptomaine poisoning.

189
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,352
Well, toodle-oo.

190
00:10:28,994 --> 00:10:31,986
Secretary 1, copywriter 0.

191
00:10:32,097 --> 00:10:33,064
It wasn't that.

192
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:36,157
I bring my lunch at least until after
the first of the month.

193
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:37,826
Get your things.

194
00:10:38,937 --> 00:10:40,666
That sandwich is making me sad.

195
00:10:43,642 --> 00:10:46,975
It's a postcard from Campbell
on his honeymoon.

196
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:48,512
Niagara Falls.

197
00:10:48,613 --> 00:10:51,309
"Greetings from the wettest place on earth. "

198
00:10:53,051 --> 00:10:54,416
I say we skip lunch altogether

199
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:57,545
and try on those narrow sweater sets
I saw at Lord and Taylor.

200
00:10:57,656 --> 00:10:59,385
Do you want me to sit
outside the dressing room

201
00:10:59,491 --> 00:11:01,049
and hold your purse?

202
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:03,684
What he's trying to say is
can we buy you lunch?

203
00:11:03,795 --> 00:11:05,763
Oh. I don't know.

204
00:11:05,864 --> 00:11:07,229
We hadn't planned on eating.

205
00:11:07,332 --> 00:11:08,356
Come on, three on two.

206
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:09,661
I know you all like being outnumbered.

207
00:11:09,768 --> 00:11:11,235
That's two on two. I'm married.

208
00:11:12,337 --> 00:11:14,237
You still have to eat lunch.

209
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:16,398
What do you say? Change of plans?

210
00:11:16,508 --> 00:11:17,907
They do smell nice.

211
00:11:19,177 --> 00:11:20,075
What's that?

212
00:11:20,178 --> 00:11:21,873
Postcard from Pete Campbell.

213
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,379
He's on a honeymoon, right?

214
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:24,471
Niagara Falls.

215
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,915
He hasn't, uh, left the room, apparently.

216
00:11:33,725 --> 00:11:34,692
Shall we?

217
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:45,227
So, Pegs, you part of our nation's
military industrial

218
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:47,430
boyfriend-girlfriend complex?

219
00:11:47,539 --> 00:11:48,528
Excuse me?

220
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,076
He wants to know are you, uh, taken,
are you kept, or merely browsing?

221
00:11:52,177 --> 00:11:53,235
She's browsing.

222
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:54,573
And like most of us,

223
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:57,113
she's disappointed
with the selection of merchandise.

224
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:00,476
Perhaps I can interest you in a 42 long?

225
00:12:00,585 --> 00:12:01,711
That's not his suit size.

226
00:12:03,755 --> 00:12:04,722
She blushes.

227
00:12:04,823 --> 00:12:05,847
No, I don't.

228
00:12:05,957 --> 00:12:10,485
Maybe I shouldn't tell you this, but, uh,
you are the subject of much debate.

229
00:12:10,595 --> 00:12:11,687
Money riding on the outcome.

230
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:12,855
Money for me?

231
00:12:12,964 --> 00:12:15,057
Now there's even a third possibility:

232
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:16,327
Paying you.

233
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:19,669
We should be getting back.

234
00:12:19,771 --> 00:12:20,931
I'll get the check.

235
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:23,064
My goodness.
Thank you for lunch, boys.

236
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:25,109
Yes. Thank you.

237
00:12:28,313 --> 00:12:30,247
Take the rest of the afternoon off.

238
00:12:30,348 --> 00:12:34,910
We could... go to the zoo,
see what the animals are up to.

239
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:38,649
I should get back to work.

240
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:40,224
Or shopping.

241
00:12:41,993 --> 00:12:44,223
Guess I don't see any money
changing hands, Kenny.

242
00:12:44,329 --> 00:12:45,227
You'll see.

243
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,696
My persistence is my charm.

244
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:49,232
That was delicious.

245
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,769
You enjoy yourself with the Hitler Youth?

246
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,968
Oh. Well, it was kind of last-minute.

247
00:12:59,077 --> 00:13:01,511
Easy. See that Draper takes a look at this.

248
00:13:01,613 --> 00:13:02,875
Certainly.

249
00:13:04,282 --> 00:13:05,544
You can look, too.

250
00:13:11,256 --> 00:13:14,953
Three of the last PTA presidents
are from the kindergarten class.

251
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,028
I say you go in there
and lay some groundwork.

252
00:13:17,128 --> 00:13:20,154
I will not have Marilyn Kechner
dictate the agenda.

253
00:13:20,265 --> 00:13:22,460
The woman is obsessed with nutrition,

254
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:24,228
although you wouldn't
know it to look at her.

255
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:26,702
Francine, you're terrible.

256
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:29,831
Ooh. I ran into Juanita Cabot
at square dancing,

257
00:13:29,941 --> 00:13:32,842
and I found out who's moving
into that little Dutch Colonial down the street.

258
00:13:32,944 --> 00:13:34,070
Who?

259
00:13:34,179 --> 00:13:36,340
Her name is Helen Bishop.

260
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:37,915
Is she an old lady?

261
00:13:38,016 --> 00:13:39,313
Divorced.

262
00:13:39,417 --> 00:13:41,715
Really?

263
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,311
9- year-old boy and a baby.

264
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:46,255
That's awful.

265
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:47,256
I know.

266
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:48,383
All on her own?

267
00:13:48,493 --> 00:13:50,586
I know.

268
00:13:50,695 --> 00:13:55,189
Can you imagine worrying about money
at this point in our lives?

269
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,200
Well, obviously,
that's not the worst of it.

270
00:13:57,302 --> 00:13:59,634
No.

271
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:01,399
No, it isn't.

272
00:14:01,506 --> 00:14:03,736
It is too quiet in there.

273
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:04,740
Ernie?

274
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:05,741
Sally?

275
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:07,903
We're playing spaceman.

276
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:11,912
Sally Draper, come over here this minute.

277
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,150
If the clothes from that dry cleaning bag
are on the floor of my closet,

278
00:14:18,256 --> 00:14:20,383
you're going to be
a very sorry young lady.

279
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:25,761
Make sure your brother hasn't climbed
out of the play yard.

280
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:29,061
Juanita thinks it might be bad
for real estate values in Chilmark.

281
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:30,725
One divorcée?

282
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:32,128
Oh, my God.

283
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,356
Are you okay?

284
00:16:05,563 --> 00:16:08,225
What's that?

285
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,265
What?

286
00:16:09,367 --> 00:16:11,028
That.

287
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,502
That's a television.

288
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:15,197
Since when do you have a television?

289
00:16:15,306 --> 00:16:19,299
I don't know. I think it's been about ten days.

290
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:22,073
It's been so amazing, I sort of lost track.

291
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,647
I seem to remember a woman

292
00:16:23,748 --> 00:16:26,012
wasting a good piece
of a beautiful afternoon

293
00:16:26,117 --> 00:16:28,017
reciting this diatribe against television

294
00:16:28,119 --> 00:16:31,850
that should have ended
with her banging her shoe on the table.

295
00:16:33,725 --> 00:16:37,422
Don, darling, if you want
to ask the question, just ask it.

296
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:38,996
Where'd you get the TV?

297
00:16:39,097 --> 00:16:41,361
I got it.

298
00:16:41,466 --> 00:16:42,956
Same place you got that wig?

299
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:44,933
Someone gave it to me.

300
00:16:46,771 --> 00:16:48,432
And you took it?

301
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,236
<i>Have you seen this thing
called People Are Funny?</i>

302
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:55,680
Jesus.

303
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,441
Oh, Jesus, Don.

304
00:17:04,055 --> 00:17:05,545
Hey!

305
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:06,919
All better?

306
00:17:09,127 --> 00:17:10,458
Yes.

307
00:17:18,603 --> 00:17:20,264
How about a hot dog?

308
00:17:22,073 --> 00:17:23,938
Sit at your places. Come on.

309
00:17:39,424 --> 00:17:40,322
Daddy!

310
00:17:40,425 --> 00:17:41,722
We went to the hospital.

311
00:17:41,826 --> 00:17:43,657
We got lollipops.

312
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:49,999
They're fine, Don.

313
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:52,937
What about you?

314
00:17:53,037 --> 00:17:55,870
A little sore.

315
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:57,339
A little embarrassed.

316
00:17:57,442 --> 00:17:59,569
Sorry they couldn't get a hold of me.

317
00:17:59,677 --> 00:18:02,840
We had to carry Freddie Rumson
out of Ritazzi's.

318
00:18:02,947 --> 00:18:04,847
There was nothing you could have done.

319
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:12,380
Daddy, use a fork.

320
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,559
How's the car?

321
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,786
Not bad.

322
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:20,126
Uh, thank God
I was only going 25 tops.

323
00:18:20,231 --> 00:18:21,630
I hate the way you drive, you know.

324
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:23,530
I'm finished.

325
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:25,569
<i>Can I go watch
Shirley Temple's Storybook?</i>

326
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,160
Yes, both of you.

327
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,145
So what happened?

328
00:18:37,248 --> 00:18:39,375
I don't know, really.

329
00:18:39,484 --> 00:18:43,215
It... It all happened so fast.

330
00:18:44,622 --> 00:18:46,385
What, 20 miles an hour?

331
00:18:46,491 --> 00:18:48,118
That's not that fast.

332
00:18:49,694 --> 00:18:51,252
It's stupid.

333
00:18:51,362 --> 00:18:53,057
Was it Sally playing with the radio again?

334
00:18:53,164 --> 00:18:54,495
- I've warned her.
- No, she was fine.

335
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:56,965
She was just sitting there. No.

336
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:01,730
It was my hands. It happened again.

337
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:06,939
Jesus.

338
00:19:08,346 --> 00:19:11,144
Betty, you have to get this taken care of.

339
00:19:11,249 --> 00:19:13,717
That Dr. Patterson is not thorough.

340
00:19:13,818 --> 00:19:15,376
I swear, when we walked
down Park Avenue,

341
00:19:15,486 --> 00:19:16,384
I could hear the quacking.

342
00:19:16,487 --> 00:19:17,784
I know. You've said that.

343
00:19:17,889 --> 00:19:20,119
This doctor was nice.

344
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:22,352
He was older, actually.

345
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,950
He's from Rochester.

346
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:26,030
He has two children.
They're 10 years apart.

347
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:27,995
Okay, you've given me his credentials.

348
00:19:28,099 --> 00:19:29,726
What did he say?

349
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:33,167
Well, he said I could go to New York
and run the dye tests,

350
00:19:33,271 --> 00:19:37,105
and I said that I already had
and that the results were negative,

351
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:39,073
and he even called Dr. Patterson.

352
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:42,508
So?

353
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:48,519
They said there was
nothing physically wrong with me.

354
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,212
Then I t-told him what happened,

355
00:19:50,321 --> 00:19:53,950
and he said that I should
see a psychiatrist.

356
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:00,159
Doctors must love

357
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:03,564
that they now have an answer
for "I don't know what's wrong. "

358
00:20:03,668 --> 00:20:05,226
He said it could be a nervous condition.

359
00:20:05,336 --> 00:20:07,327
Nervous about what, driving?

360
00:20:07,438 --> 00:20:09,235
So we'll go down to the Grand Union
parking lot.

361
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,364
We'll practice your 10 and 2.

362
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:12,306
He seemed very concerned,
if you want to know.

363
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:13,843
But that's their solution.

364
00:20:13,945 --> 00:20:16,311
Why not open the hood
and poke around?

365
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,281
So?

366
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:23,013
So... I left.

367
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:24,418
What else am I supposed to do?

368
00:20:24,522 --> 00:20:25,546
Well, go to a doctor...

369
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:26,817
another doctor, a good one.

370
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:29,325
I'll get a specialist from Bert Cooper.

371
00:20:29,427 --> 00:20:31,725
His name's on a wall
over at St. Vincent's.

372
00:20:31,829 --> 00:20:33,160
Okay.

373
00:20:33,264 --> 00:20:35,289
Leave the dishes for the girl.

374
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:43,901
7, 8, 9,

375
00:20:44,008 --> 00:20:48,968
10, 11, 12...

376
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:55,041
98, 99, 100.

377
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:11,593
You know, I do worry about you, birdie.

378
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:13,193
I know.

379
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:20,538
When he brought it up, I was shocked.

380
00:21:22,613 --> 00:21:25,946
Although, I realize that
that's what Dr. Patterson

381
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:29,213
was trying to say in his own way, and...

382
00:21:32,056 --> 00:21:36,015
it doesn't have...
as much of a stigma today.

383
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,956
I just don't know
what they can possibly tell you.

384
00:21:45,269 --> 00:21:47,999
Do you think I need a psychiatrist?

385
00:21:55,413 --> 00:21:59,941
I always thought people saw a psychiatrist
when they were unhappy.

386
00:22:01,552 --> 00:22:03,611
But I look at you...

387
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:06,514
and this...

388
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:09,618
and them...

389
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,989
and that...

390
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:21,369
and I think, "Are you unhappy?"

391
00:22:24,709 --> 00:22:27,507
Of course I'm happy.

392
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:30,547
Well, that'll be $35. You're welcome.

393
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,718
Whatever you think is best.

394
00:22:34,819 --> 00:22:35,786
Good.

395
00:23:04,048 --> 00:23:06,346
Act of God. Sorry.

396
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:09,215
Someone threw themselves
in front of the train.

397
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,379
Ah, suicide.

398
00:23:14,058 --> 00:23:16,788
Okay, boys, what do we have?

399
00:23:18,062 --> 00:23:22,362
Gentlemen, the aerosol can
is nothing less than space-age.

400
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:23,991
It's steel. It has exhaust.

401
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:25,569
It's even shaped like a rocket.

402
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:28,104
Certainly an engineering marvel.

403
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:29,969
"Right Guard:

404
00:23:30,074 --> 00:23:32,599
It works in my suit or yours. "

405
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:35,270
We'll punch the yellow of the moon
so it pops behind him.

406
00:23:41,185 --> 00:23:42,311
We're looking for new worlds,

407
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,854
and with that search
comes any number of gadgets.

408
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:46,924
It's not just some random association.

409
00:23:47,024 --> 00:23:49,492
This thing is shiny. It's explosive.

410
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:52,222
It's from the future,
a place so close to us now,

411
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,161
filled with wonder and ease.

412
00:23:56,167 --> 00:23:58,795
Except some people
think of the future and it upsets them.

413
00:24:00,104 --> 00:24:02,231
They see a rocket,
they start building a bomb shelter.

414
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,035
What? How do you get there?

415
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:07,543
I don't think it's ridiculous to assume
we're looking for other planets

416
00:24:07,645 --> 00:24:09,636
because this one will end.

417
00:24:09,747 --> 00:24:11,772
I thought we had something here.

418
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:13,908
Who is this moron flying around space?

419
00:24:14,018 --> 00:24:16,043
I mean, he pees in his pants.

420
00:24:18,923 --> 00:24:21,517
Brass tacks, who buys this?

421
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,753
Some woman.

422
00:24:23,861 --> 00:24:27,194
Your girl or your mother will pick this up

423
00:24:27,298 --> 00:24:30,096
walking through the grocery store
or the druggist's.

424
00:24:30,201 --> 00:24:31,759
We should be asking ourselves,

425
00:24:31,869 --> 00:24:33,131
"What do women want?"

426
00:24:33,237 --> 00:24:35,603
I don't know, but I wish I had it.

427
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:40,069
Maybe a chesty alien girl
also wants to get into his suit.

428
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:41,509
I'm not asking "what do women want"

429
00:24:41,612 --> 00:24:43,876
in some bullshit
research psychology way.

430
00:24:43,981 --> 00:24:46,449
I'm asking,
what would make a woman

431
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:49,179
look at this man's deodorant
and say "I want that"?

432
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:51,380
Well, I've stopped
trying to figure out what they think.

433
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:53,047
Maybe I should stop paying you.

434
00:24:57,528 --> 00:24:59,860
Well, I always thought
women like the way we smell.

435
00:24:59,964 --> 00:25:01,522
That explains a lot.

436
00:25:01,632 --> 00:25:03,099
I feel like we're close here.

437
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:04,498
I mean, this one...

438
00:25:04,602 --> 00:25:07,867
the can's right side up,
but the guy's upside-down.

439
00:25:07,972 --> 00:25:10,440
No. Let's bring it down to Earth.

440
00:25:13,811 --> 00:25:16,541
You think they want a cowboy?

441
00:25:16,647 --> 00:25:20,048
He's quiet and strong.

442
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:24,053
He always brings the cattle home safe.

443
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:28,850
You watch TV.

444
00:25:31,028 --> 00:25:33,121
What if they want something else?

445
00:25:34,765 --> 00:25:36,460
Inside, some...

446
00:25:38,302 --> 00:25:41,465
mysterious wish that we're ignoring.

447
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:02,692
How'd it go?

448
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:05,485
I've still got my novel.

449
00:26:05,596 --> 00:26:07,086
I'm sorry.

450
00:26:08,699 --> 00:26:10,394
Buy me lunch?

451
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:15,197
Samuel, that drape, man?

452
00:26:15,306 --> 00:26:16,705
It's sadder than a map.

453
00:26:16,807 --> 00:26:20,106
Well, it's lightweight,
and it tells me I'm at work.

454
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:22,179
But you sure can talk, Mr. Kinsey.

455
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,440
60 cents.

456
00:26:23,547 --> 00:26:26,675
What are you doing? Keep the change.

457
00:26:28,886 --> 00:26:30,217
You figured the place out yet?

458
00:26:30,321 --> 00:26:31,379
What do you mean?

459
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:32,547
How it runs.

460
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:35,285
I know the copywriters
tell the Art Department what to do,

461
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:38,157
and I know the account executives
tell the copywriters what to do.

462
00:26:38,262 --> 00:26:39,524
What?

463
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:42,360
No one tells the writers what to do
except for the head of Creative,

464
00:26:42,466 --> 00:26:45,026
your boss, Donald Draper.

465
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:48,333
Don't think that just because
he's good-looking, he's not a writer.

466
00:26:48,439 --> 00:26:49,371
Dig.

467
00:26:49,473 --> 00:26:51,202
This is the Media Department.

468
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:53,300
They're where 90% of where
the client's check goes.

469
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:56,209
They buy space... newspapers,
billboards, television,

470
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:59,283
and my favorite aging whore, radio.

471
00:26:59,383 --> 00:27:02,443
That's the whole shakedown, actually.

472
00:27:02,553 --> 00:27:04,043
All you really need to know.

473
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:06,715
They don't sell ideas
or campaigns or jingles.

474
00:27:06,824 --> 00:27:09,224
They sell media at a 15% markup.

475
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:10,555
Creative is just window dressing

476
00:27:10,661 --> 00:27:11,559
that's thrown in for free.

477
00:27:11,662 --> 00:27:12,890
Really?

478
00:27:12,997 --> 00:27:14,931
Accounting, they keep track
of how much we're spending

479
00:27:15,032 --> 00:27:16,124
versus how much we're taking in,

480
00:27:16,233 --> 00:27:17,825
and since we're buying futures,

481
00:27:17,935 --> 00:27:22,634
if you ever, ever see, um,
the man upstairs go in there,

482
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,037
grab the lifeboats, baby.

483
00:27:24,141 --> 00:27:25,904
We're going down.

484
00:27:27,978 --> 00:27:29,843
Account Management,

485
00:27:29,947 --> 00:27:34,043
<i>where prep schoolers skip arm-in-arm,
Wizard of Oz style,</i>

486
00:27:34,151 --> 00:27:38,178
joined together by their lack of skill
and their love of mirrors.

487
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:41,325
Account executives
are all good at something,

488
00:27:41,425 --> 00:27:45,191
although it's never advertising.

489
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:49,528
Submitted for your approval:
One Peter Campbell,

490
00:27:49,633 --> 00:27:51,191
a man who recently discovered

491
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:55,261
that the only place for his hand
is in your pocket.

492
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:57,364
You watch it?

493
00:27:57,475 --> 00:27:59,340
<i>Have you seen it? The Twilight Zone?</i>

494
00:27:59,443 --> 00:28:02,537
I don't think so.
I don't like science fiction.

495
00:28:02,646 --> 00:28:04,841
I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.

496
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:07,179
Mitch in Media says
CBS might pull the plug.

497
00:28:07,284 --> 00:28:08,717
I'll kill myself.

498
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:16,886
And here we have
the Creative Department,

499
00:28:16,994 --> 00:28:18,894
the talent, home sweet home.

500
00:28:18,996 --> 00:28:20,930
Like the Art Department downstairs,

501
00:28:21,031 --> 00:28:23,295
they put us far enough
away from the elevators

502
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:25,198
so we can't sneak out.

503
00:28:30,274 --> 00:28:32,242
You know,

504
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:35,210
there are women copywriters.

505
00:28:35,312 --> 00:28:36,973
- Good ones?
- Sure.

506
00:28:37,081 --> 00:28:39,914
I mean, y-you can always tell
when a woman's writing copy,

507
00:28:40,017 --> 00:28:43,578
but sometimes she just might be
the right man for the job, you know?

508
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:47,857
You must be very creatively satisfied.

509
00:28:47,958 --> 00:28:50,426
Let's not lose our heads.

510
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:53,554
Sterling-Coop is positively Cro-Magnon.

511
00:28:53,664 --> 00:28:55,723
I have a friend... I'm not even going
to say what agency...

512
00:28:55,833 --> 00:28:58,097
but all they do is smoke Mary Jane
and play darts,

513
00:28:58,202 --> 00:29:00,727
and honestly, I think
they're the best store on the street.

514
00:29:03,474 --> 00:29:05,465
You like Ukrainian food?

515
00:29:05,576 --> 00:29:07,737
Oxtail dumplings?

516
00:29:07,845 --> 00:29:09,904
I still have a lot of work to do.

517
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:11,504
I think he's still in there.

518
00:29:11,615 --> 00:29:12,809
Huh. Got it.

519
00:29:14,151 --> 00:29:17,052
Thanks for lunch.
Sorry about your copy.

520
00:29:17,154 --> 00:29:19,122
Thanks for reminding me.

521
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:39,839
Can never get used
to the fact that most of the time

522
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,343
it looks like you're doing nothing.

523
00:29:42,813 --> 00:29:44,678
Fix you something?

524
00:29:44,782 --> 00:29:47,683
4:30. Close enough.

525
00:29:47,785 --> 00:29:48,877
Coop is gonna want a carve-in

526
00:29:48,986 --> 00:29:50,977
with your handpicked team for Nixon on it,

527
00:29:51,088 --> 00:29:55,286
and I warn you right now,
it includes Pete Campbell.

528
00:29:55,392 --> 00:29:57,019
I should go to Niagara Falls for two weeks.

529
00:29:57,127 --> 00:29:58,594
Does wonders for your career.

530
00:29:58,696 --> 00:30:00,425
Niagara Falls.

531
00:30:00,531 --> 00:30:03,056
Boy redefines lack of imagination.

532
00:30:06,136 --> 00:30:08,536
Ah. That's where you've been.

533
00:30:08,639 --> 00:30:12,166
Let me ask you something.

534
00:30:12,276 --> 00:30:13,504
What do women want?

535
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:15,636
Who cares?

536
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:18,542
You mentioned the other night

537
00:30:18,649 --> 00:30:22,176
that your daughter
had been to a psychiatrist.

538
00:30:24,188 --> 00:30:26,349
I'm sure you must be mistaken about that.

539
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,927
You know what?

540
00:30:31,028 --> 00:30:34,828
I am very comfortable with my mind:
Thoughts clean and unclean,

541
00:30:34,932 --> 00:30:37,696
loving and... the opposite of that.

542
00:30:37,801 --> 00:30:40,827
But I'm not a woman.

543
00:30:40,938 --> 00:30:42,462
And I think it behooves any man

544
00:30:42,573 --> 00:30:46,566
to toss all female troubles
into the hands of a stranger.

545
00:30:46,677 --> 00:30:48,304
We had one headshrinker in the army.

546
00:30:48,412 --> 00:30:51,745
A gossip, busting
with other people's thoughts.

547
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:53,714
Hasn't changed much, just costs more.

548
00:30:53,817 --> 00:30:55,341
And you can't shoot at them.

549
00:30:55,452 --> 00:30:56,680
We live in troubling times.

550
00:30:56,787 --> 00:30:58,084
We do?

551
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:02,454
Who could not be happy with all this?

552
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,891
Jesus, you know what they want?

553
00:31:03,994 --> 00:31:05,154
Everything.

554
00:31:05,262 --> 00:31:07,992
Especially if the other girls have it.

555
00:31:08,098 --> 00:31:12,762
Trust me, psychiatry is just
this year's candy-pink stove.

556
00:31:17,808 --> 00:31:19,935
It's just more happiness.

557
00:31:27,918 --> 00:31:29,317
<i>People...</i>

558
00:31:30,554 --> 00:31:31,452
<i>Are...</i>

559
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:34,387
<i>Funnyl</i>

560
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,650
Beauty and the beast.

561
00:31:37,761 --> 00:31:38,955
Hey, Daddy.

562
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:42,464
Hey, there. Cold lamb sound good?

563
00:31:42,566 --> 00:31:44,033
Yeah.

564
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:51,502
Someone started on the train.

565
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:52,769
In the office.

566
00:31:52,876 --> 00:31:55,743
Because of a good day or a bad day?

567
00:31:57,348 --> 00:32:00,909
You know, when I told you
you had everything...

568
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:04,418
I was wrong.

569
00:32:08,258 --> 00:32:10,021
Oh, my God.

570
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:13,353
White gold.

571
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:18,128
It's got one of those tiny little faces
that you have to be young to see.

572
00:32:18,235 --> 00:32:20,100
Don, it's beautiful.

573
00:32:21,772 --> 00:32:25,299
The guy at the store set the time,
but he was English,

574
00:32:25,409 --> 00:32:27,468
so it might be six hours off.

575
00:32:27,578 --> 00:32:30,274
Did you look at Sally's face?

576
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:31,678
I think she has a bruise.

577
00:32:31,782 --> 00:32:32,942
I didn't see it.

578
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:35,211
On her cheekbone under her eye.

579
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:36,718
I thought that was ketchup.

580
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:40,813
What if she had gotten a scar,
something permanent?

581
00:32:40,924 --> 00:32:42,721
I don't want to play what-if.

582
00:32:42,826 --> 00:32:45,386
I'm just saying if it happened to Bobby
it would have been okay

583
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:49,159
because a boy with a scar is nothing,
but a girl, it's so much worse.

584
00:32:49,266 --> 00:32:50,324
Nothing happened.

585
00:32:50,434 --> 00:32:52,368
I keep...

586
00:32:52,469 --> 00:32:53,527
thinking...

587
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:58,437
Not that I c-could have killed the kids,

588
00:32:58,542 --> 00:33:03,809
but... worse.

589
00:33:03,914 --> 00:33:07,543
Sally could have survived...

590
00:33:07,651 --> 00:33:09,949
and gone on living with this...

591
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:14,218
horrible scar on her face, and...

592
00:33:14,324 --> 00:33:18,727
some long, lonely...

593
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:21,697
miserable life as...

594
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:26,392
Don.

595
00:33:36,747 --> 00:33:38,647
What's happening to me?

596
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:44,082
Do I need to see someone?

597
00:33:51,695 --> 00:33:53,026
I don't know.

598
00:33:55,065 --> 00:33:56,430
I guess so.

599
00:33:58,135 --> 00:33:59,693
Whatever you want.

600
00:34:11,081 --> 00:34:14,312
11 a. m. Did you get fired?

601
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:17,978
Brought Betty into the city to see the doctor,

602
00:34:18,088 --> 00:34:21,319
but, uh, honestly...

603
00:34:21,425 --> 00:34:25,191
I think I'm the one that's not feeling so great.

604
00:34:25,295 --> 00:34:27,456
I called in sick.

605
00:34:27,564 --> 00:34:30,260
Don't bring that here.

606
00:34:30,367 --> 00:34:33,165
I'm serious, Don.
Don't talk to me about her.

607
00:34:34,905 --> 00:34:36,463
It makes me feel cruel.

608
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:45,679
You're right.

609
00:34:47,317 --> 00:34:48,614
Sometimes.

610
00:34:50,654 --> 00:34:53,088
I can't decide

611
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:56,284
if you have everything...

612
00:34:56,393 --> 00:34:58,122
or nothing.

613
00:34:58,228 --> 00:35:00,162
I live in the moment.

614
00:35:05,836 --> 00:35:07,929
Nothing is everything.

615
00:35:09,406 --> 00:35:12,307
Sounds more like you live in the Village.

616
00:35:12,409 --> 00:35:14,775
Actually, I live in the hall.

617
00:35:14,878 --> 00:35:16,345
I lost my key.

618
00:35:16,446 --> 00:35:19,745
I had to, um...
spend the night abroad.

619
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:21,477
Could you be a gentleman

620
00:35:21,585 --> 00:35:24,611
and break in to the fire escape
so I don't have to?

621
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,663
Draper in yet?

622
00:35:35,766 --> 00:35:37,825
He's not coming in today.
He's not feeling well.

623
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:40,631
I'm leaving. Don't tell anyone I was here.

624
00:35:48,879 --> 00:35:50,437
<i>Bienvenue.</i>

625
00:35:52,015 --> 00:35:53,915
No, it's Peggy.

626
00:35:55,185 --> 00:35:56,243
Hello.

627
00:35:59,089 --> 00:36:00,818
I don't think I can go out to lunch today.

628
00:36:00,924 --> 00:36:02,323
Mr. Draper's not coming in.

629
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:04,758
That means you can go out to lunch.

630
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:06,762
Have you never worked
in an office before?

631
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:08,593
Well, he could call.

632
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:09,688
It's my second week.

633
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,267
Another time?

634
00:36:11,368 --> 00:36:13,393
I did enjoy the tour the other day.

635
00:36:13,503 --> 00:36:14,731
It was eye-opening.

636
00:36:14,838 --> 00:36:17,807
I didn't think your eyes
could be any wider.

637
00:36:17,908 --> 00:36:19,307
That's clever.

638
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,308
I guess I'll go to the cart.
You want something?

639
00:36:29,019 --> 00:36:29,986
What?

640
00:36:31,688 --> 00:36:33,212
The office is gonna
empty out any second.

641
00:36:33,323 --> 00:36:35,086
We can push the couch
in front of the door.

642
00:36:35,192 --> 00:36:37,217
Paul.

643
00:36:37,327 --> 00:36:40,592
Do you belong to someone else?

644
00:36:40,697 --> 00:36:43,257
Shit.

645
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:45,335
I don't even like to sit in Don's chair.

646
00:36:45,435 --> 00:36:47,460
I think we've
misunderstood each other.

647
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:54,241
But there is someone else, right?

648
00:36:54,344 --> 00:36:55,402
Yes.

649
00:37:16,533 --> 00:37:18,330
I hope you know that covering
your typewriter

650
00:37:18,435 --> 00:37:20,835
is office code for "I'm done for the day. "

651
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:22,269
I'm not feeling so swell.

652
00:37:22,372 --> 00:37:25,830
Neither am I. Look at these letters
you typed after lunch.

653
00:37:25,943 --> 00:37:31,210
Terre Haute, Indiana,
has two Rs and an A and an E at the end.

654
00:37:31,315 --> 00:37:33,044
I think either you missed
home row by a hand,

655
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:35,380
or you were out drinking
with the junior account boys again.

656
00:37:35,485 --> 00:37:36,383
I wasn't drinking.

657
00:37:36,486 --> 00:37:38,215
I don't like your tone.

658
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,690
I'll redo these right away.

659
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:44,056
Look at you, all in a snit.

660
00:37:45,929 --> 00:37:47,089
Are you gonna watch me?

661
00:37:47,197 --> 00:37:48,425
What is wrong with you?

662
00:37:49,733 --> 00:37:52,793
Honestly, why is it that every time

663
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:54,928
a man takes you
out to lunch around here,

664
00:37:55,038 --> 00:37:56,869
you're... you're the dessert?

665
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:58,100
That's terrible.

666
00:37:58,208 --> 00:38:00,108
It's constant from every corner.

667
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:02,735
I'm from Bay Ridge. We have manners.

668
00:38:02,846 --> 00:38:04,473
Why can't they just leave it alone?

669
00:38:04,581 --> 00:38:06,845
Because men always
bother you all the time.

670
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:09,350
They follow you down the street.

671
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:10,977
Well, not exactly.

672
00:38:11,088 --> 00:38:13,784
Look, dear, I don't know you that well,

673
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:15,653
but you're the new girl,
and you're not much,

674
00:38:15,759 --> 00:38:18,057
so you might as well enjoy it while it lasts.

675
00:38:18,161 --> 00:38:20,061
Of course.

676
00:38:20,163 --> 00:38:21,391
Don't be that way.

677
00:38:21,498 --> 00:38:23,466
I'm just offering some perspective, that's all.

678
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:26,896
Thank you, Joan.

679
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:28,403
I'll save my thank-yous

680
00:38:28,505 --> 00:38:30,336
till you correct that correspondence.

681
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:53,285
I don't know why I'm here.

682
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:57,154
I'm... I mean, I do.

683
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:03,130
I'm... nervous, I guess.

684
00:40:03,233 --> 00:40:05,064
Anxious.

685
00:40:06,803 --> 00:40:08,600
I don't sleep that well.

686
00:40:10,707 --> 00:40:12,299
And my hands...

687
00:40:14,544 --> 00:40:16,239
Well, they're fine now.

688
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:21,449
It's like when you have
a problem with your car

689
00:40:21,551 --> 00:40:25,009
and you go to the mechanic
and it's not doing it anymore.

690
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:29,483
Not that you are a mechanic.

691
00:40:36,099 --> 00:40:39,694
I guess a lot of people must come here
worried about the bomb.

692
00:40:39,803 --> 00:40:41,168
Is that true?

693
00:40:45,475 --> 00:40:47,409
It's a common nightmare, people say.

694
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:49,479
I read it in a magazine.

695
00:40:57,354 --> 00:41:02,189
My mother always told me
that it wasn't polite to talk about yourself.

696
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:08,857
She passed away recently.

697
00:41:11,968 --> 00:41:14,061
I guess I already said that.

698
00:41:19,342 --> 00:41:20,502
Can I smoke in here?

699
00:41:47,437 --> 00:41:49,769
We're all so lucky to be here.

700
00:41:52,209 --> 00:41:54,268
It's 7:30.

701
00:41:54,377 --> 00:41:56,242
I have to go to Roy's reading.

702
00:41:56,346 --> 00:42:00,282
I have to be there to act surprised
when Jack Kerouac doesn't show.

703
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:05,417
Lock the door when you leave.

704
00:42:11,895 --> 00:42:14,455
If you're gonna go home,
take a shower.

705
00:42:14,564 --> 00:42:15,929
You stink.

706
00:42:16,032 --> 00:42:18,227
It's because I'm a man.

707
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:20,360
You seem to forget that sometimes.

708
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:21,903
I'm lucky they aren't all like you.

709
00:42:22,005 --> 00:42:23,632
I'll take that as a compliment.

710
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:30,043
What do women want?

711
00:42:30,146 --> 00:42:33,582
Well, one of the things has to be
not being asked something like that.

712
00:42:33,683 --> 00:42:36,243
"What do women want?

713
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:38,480
You know better than to ask. "

714
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,759
Give me a pen.

715
00:42:44,861 --> 00:42:46,260
Jesus.

716
00:42:53,436 --> 00:42:55,063
"What do women want?"

717
00:42:57,507 --> 00:43:00,135
"Any excuse to get closer. "

718
00:43:01,177 --> 00:43:02,644
Thank God.

719
00:43:03,947 --> 00:43:06,780
There's that ego people pay to see.

720
00:43:15,892 --> 00:43:17,223
I'll have the filet of sole.

721
00:43:17,327 --> 00:43:18,521
Excellent.

722
00:43:18,628 --> 00:43:20,960
Creamed spinach or creamed corn?

723
00:43:21,064 --> 00:43:21,962
Spinach.

724
00:43:22,065 --> 00:43:23,362
Fried potatoes or au gratin?

725
00:43:23,466 --> 00:43:25,866
Au gratin. With tomato juice to start.

726
00:43:25,969 --> 00:43:27,095
I'll have a goulash.

727
00:43:27,203 --> 00:43:28,693
Very good, sir.

728
00:43:31,975 --> 00:43:34,307
Vodka gimlet.

729
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:35,810
Old-fashioned.

730
00:43:44,921 --> 00:43:46,411
How was your day?

731
00:43:48,124 --> 00:43:49,318
Fine.

732
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:51,394
You know, I work with doctors.

733
00:43:51,494 --> 00:43:53,086
They'll say anything you pay them to.

734
00:43:53,196 --> 00:43:55,426
Of course, dear.

735
00:43:55,532 --> 00:43:57,500
Dinner in the city.

736
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,158
I'm glad I'm hungry.

737
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:03,232
<i>I saw an interesting thing
in the Journal American.</i>

738
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:04,398
Apparently, the phone company

739
00:44:04,507 --> 00:44:08,637
wants to start charging people
for unlisted numbers.

740
00:44:08,745 --> 00:44:10,303
That doesn't seem fair.

741
00:44:10,413 --> 00:44:11,505
Some people agree with you,

742
00:44:11,614 --> 00:44:13,081
and they're giving aliases to Ma Bell.

743
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:14,650
They call it the nom-de-phone.

744
00:44:14,751 --> 00:44:17,015
Isn't that smart?

745
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,816
Of course, most of them
are pornographic.

746
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:23,119
The best one?

747
00:44:23,226 --> 00:44:24,193
Pat McGroin.

748
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:26,194
Oh, my God.

749
00:44:26,296 --> 00:44:27,661
Hard to believe they could print that

750
00:44:27,764 --> 00:44:29,561
<i>in the Journal American,
let alone a phone book.</i>

751
00:44:41,745 --> 00:44:43,235
This is nice.

752
00:44:59,662 --> 00:45:01,095
I'll be right up.

753
00:45:21,851 --> 00:45:24,012
Hello.

754
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,246
Sorry to bother you so late.

755
00:45:25,355 --> 00:45:26,344
It's Don Draper.

756
00:45:26,456 --> 00:45:27,946
Oh, hello, Mr. Draper.

757
00:45:28,057 --> 00:45:30,184
No, no. It's not too late at all.

758
00:45:30,293 --> 00:45:32,158
Glad to hear that.

759
00:45:32,262 --> 00:45:33,786
Well?

760
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:38,596
Well, I had a very interesting hour
with your wife this afternoon.

761
00:45:38,701 --> 00:45:42,535
She's a very anxious young woman.

762
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:44,607
I think you're doing the right thing.
