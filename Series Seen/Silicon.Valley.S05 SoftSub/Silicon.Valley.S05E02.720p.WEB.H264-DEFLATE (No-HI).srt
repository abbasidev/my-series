1
00:00:00,231 --> 00:00:04,290
I sent you 63 good people.
You have to choose.

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,080
They have
to meet our rigorous standards.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,120
I mean, look at the three
we've already hired.

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,250
Stallions.

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,250
Hooli is the future,
and your future is...

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,460
The Box 2.
Are there any questions?

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,750
Everything you're doing here
is antiquated.

8
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:22,120
Fuck you guys.
Get out of here.

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,960
You wish to acquire
a company called Sliceline?

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,500
I will be taking on a total
engineering team of about 50.

11
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,460
Um... Wha...

12
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,710
- Don't tell anyone, okay?
- Um...

13
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,330
My Tesla finally came.

14
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,420
Was that a wise purchase?

15
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,750
Considering Richard just

16
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:57,290
obliterated Pied Piper's runway
hiring all those coders?

17
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,540
I ordered it a month ago.

18
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,250
But still, it's an investment.

19
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,540
As I understand,

20
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,210
cars depreciate
10 percent

21
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,670
as soon as they
fall off the truck.

22
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,040
Like that.

23
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,710
So if the car costs $100,

24
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,710
well you just lost $10.

25
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,540
Did it cost $100?

26
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,040
Or more?

27
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,670
It's not about the money.

28
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,620
I, my friend, am now part

29
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,210
of the green revolution.

30
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,540
Are you?

31
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,960
Most electricity
still comes from

32
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,080
gas plants and
coal-burning smoke stacks.

33
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,710
Do you know where
your electricity comes from?

34
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,580
No.
Mm-hmm.

35
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,250
Look how shiny it is.

36
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,040
Plus, it has a frunk...

37
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,420
a front trunk.

38
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,750
Here, hop in, let me
give you a ride to work.

39
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,670
Dinesh,

40
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:52,710
you like this?

41
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,120
Jesus fucking Christ!

42
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,710
Is that a dead pig?
Yes.

43
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,040
It's just like Errich.

44
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,460
My corrupt uncle

45
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,250
sent a death certificate

46
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,210
from China

47
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:08,420
but to send body
is too expensive.

48
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,120
So...

49
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,120
I cremate a pig

50
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,290
because a pig is
most like a fat human.

51
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,870
I gotta get to work.

52
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,040
Dinesh...

53
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,750
can you take
pig to backyard?

54
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,420
I need to burn it.

55
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,580
No.

56
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,670
That's odd.

57
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:35,960
You left before me.

58
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,080
How was I able
to park before you?

59
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,790
I guess all 50
of the new employees

60
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,250
decided to show up
bright and early

61
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,460
for the fucking
all-hands meeting.

62
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,290
I had to park on level five.

63
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,330
Huh! So unlike you,

64
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,620
the world understands

65
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,370
that I'm saving the planet

66
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,040
and has rewarded me with...

67
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,000
primo spot.

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,370
Congratulations.

69
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,210
You've finally taken
your rightful spot

70
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,790
amongst the handicapped.

71
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,000
Is it broken?

72
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,000
Uh, no.
I think I'm okay.

73
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,580
One question,
what the fuck happened?

74
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,170
'Cause... you were
doing your speech

75
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,170
right there in front
of the whole company,

76
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,170
and then...

77
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,330
Wow.

78
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:28,830
Well...

79
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,330
uh, my speech was going poorly.

80
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,500
Agreed.
Yeah.

81
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,170
And I started to panic.

82
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,210
With good reason.

83
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:37,000
And then...

84
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,790
all of a sudden, I...

85
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,330
I thought I had
to shit my pants, okay?

86
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,830
And that's why you jumped

87
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:44,540
face first into
a glass wall?

88
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,170
No, it all happened so fast,

89
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:48,870
but... essentially, I thought,

90
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,420
if it was gonna happen,
I didn't want to be standing.

91
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,540
So, I crouched, because...

92
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,580
If you wanna
shit yourself,

93
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,460
you'd rather be
crouching than standing?

94
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,710
Yes. I mean, if you had to.

95
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:02,040
I hate to say this,
but I follow you.

96
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,040
The thing is, when I
crouched, I had to burp.

97
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,830
But since I was all,
you know, tucked up,

98
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,210
I actually
vomited a little.

99
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:12,710
And then, that's when my
fight-or-flight reflex kicked in.

100
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,830
Do you ever fight?

101
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:18,920
Okay, fine, then my "or flight"
reflex kicked in and I just...

102
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,500
Pow.
Yeah.

103
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,170
Okay. Well, what we saw
was a very oily man

104
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,170
in mid-sentence dip down,

105
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:30,710
vomit, and then
thrust himself violently

106
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:33,830
face first into
a glass wall.

107
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,460
But I guess it's a lot
less embarrassing

108
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,580
the way you explain it.

109
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,750
Richard, what about...

110
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,790
Did you evacuate
in your pants?

111
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,250
Oh, no, uh, good news.

112
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,420
I think what happened
when I hit the glass,

113
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,830
I sort of shocked myself.

114
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,040
Now, I don't have to.

115
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,500
That's actually
kind of disappointing,

116
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,250
because, like,
no closure.

117
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,420
Well, on the bright side,
it'll be that much easier

118
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,080
to get you cleaned up
and back out there.

119
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,420
What? I have you scheduled for
three more days of orientation.

120
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,080
No way. Cancel them.

121
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,540
There's no way
I'm going back out there.

122
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,750
Especially after knowing
what they saw.

123
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,500
No, fuck it. Plus, I'm...
I'm way too busy, so.

124
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,040
Gentlemen, could we
have the room please?

125
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,620
So we can leave?
Sweet.

126
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:14,210
Richard,
look out there.

127
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:17,620
There's Optimoji and Sliceline
t-shirts left and right.

128
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,920
These are conquered soldiers
still in their old uniforms.

129
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,460
But we need everyone here
to be Pied Pipers.

130
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,460
I mean, you're asking them

131
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:28,000
to spend the primes
of their lives on your vision.

132
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,330
Right? And you need to go
out there and lead them.

133
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,460
They're... they're yearning
for inspiration.

134
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,370
I can't do inspiration.

135
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,920
I'm a coder.

136
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,500
Look there,
the new Internet.

137
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,000
That's inspiration.
Use that.

138
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,960
Richard, this is all an idea.

139
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,370
And people don't
wanna follow an idea,

140
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:43,960
they wanna follow a leader.

141
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,250
Look at the last guy
to create a new Internet.

142
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,250
Al Gore.

143
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,790
His ideas were excellent,

144
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:51,620
but he talked like a
narcoleptic plantation owner,

145
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,830
so he lost the presidency
to a fake cowboy

146
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,420
and now he makes
apocalypse porn.

147
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,750
Look, the point is, you
need to lead with passion.

148
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,210
When you set your mind to it,

149
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,670
you're one of the most charismatic
people I've ever met.

150
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,250
And I have met Ira Glass.

151
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,210
I know it's three days
we could be working,

152
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:09,080
but ultimately, a unified team
will save us time in the end.

153
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,620
You wanna save time?

154
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,870
If you wanna save time,
here's what you do.

155
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,120
You said it yourself,
okay, the Optimoji guys

156
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,120
and the Sliceline guys
are separate,

157
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,620
with their own
separate histories,

158
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,370
their own separate
shorthands,

159
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:21,580
so let's use that.

160
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,830
Let's give the scheduler
to the Optimoji guys,

161
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:26,250
and the server-less runtime
to the Sliceline guys.

162
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,500
Then we have Dinesh and Gilfoyle and the
Stallions, they do the integration.

163
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,250
Boom, we're off and running.
How about that?

164
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,670
That way, no one has to
shit or burp or puke

165
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:37,250
or get a nosebleed
in front of anyone.

166
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,960
Sco As for the bezel design,
our young aesthete, Dang,

167
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,580
has once again spun gold.

168
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,710
Let's see it.

169
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,040
Wait, my signature's not on it?

170
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,040
How could it be the Gavin
Belson Signature Box III

171
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,580
without Gavin Belson's
signature on it?

172
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,750
Well, the word "signature"
has a handwritten feel to it.

173
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,670
Why is my signature
not on this?

174
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,870
Gavin, there was a slight
issue with your signature.

175
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,500
What issue?

176
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,040
Do you have a mock-up?
Pull it up.

177
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,920
Ah, yes! There.

178
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,370
What's wrong with that?

179
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:17,210
Well, reactions to this from
our testing groups were mixed,

180
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:20,920
so we contacted
a handwriting expert.

181
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,750
And, uh, well...

182
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,460
Jean, do you
have the report?

183
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,620
Absolutely.

184
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,040
Pleasure to be on your team, Gavin.
Here it is.

185
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,250
"The signature
displayed troubling traits.

186
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,710
"Left of upright slant,

187
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:34,250
"narrow angles,
tense strokes,

188
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,420
conclusively indicative
of sociopathic tendencies."

189
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,960
What?
"Characterized by

190
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,620
"a lack of empathy
and need to dominate,

191
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,750
"a willingness to hurt others
to achieve one's goals.

192
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,460
Inability to accept bad news..."

193
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,710
- Hoover?
- Sir?

194
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:49,920
Get this horrible women
the fuck out of my office, now.

195
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,080
What the fuck is that?

196
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,460
It's the cheapest thing
I could find

197
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,330
that qualified
as an electric vehicle.

198
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,960
I found it on Craigslist.

199
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,460
Now you get to park
on the fifth floor.

200
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,580
Enjoy the drive.

201
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,330
Oh, and you were right...

202
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:12,540
it does feel good to be
a part of the green revolution.

203
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:16,170
Oh, yeah? Well, does that
"vehicle" have "Insane Mode"?

204
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,580
One press of a button

205
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:21,120
and I go zero to 60
in 3.2...

206
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,500
What a day.

207
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,040
See, we'd still be
finishing up orientation,

208
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,830
singing Kumbayas
and doing trust falls.

209
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,000
But instead,

210
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,330
both our Optimoji
and Sliceline teams

211
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:38,750
have gone through
their first code review.

212
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,620
Well, to be fair, I never
would've scheduled trust falls.

213
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,040
I mean, you do one of those,
you're so jacked up on adrenaline,

214
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,620
the rest of the day
is basically shot.

215
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:49,080
We were gonna have a noncompetitive
talent show with no losers.

216
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,080
Not possible.

217
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,290
Dick, I just got in
and checked the commits.

218
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,830
Are you aware
that the Sliceline guys

219
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:56,830
have been encoding time
in nanoseconds,

220
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,040
as we usually do,

221
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,620
but the Optimoji guys
have been using milliseconds?

222
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,330
What?

223
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,210
Just the fact that
we're still calling them

224
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:07,290
Sliceline guys
and Optimoji guys

225
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:08,960
is sending up
all sorts of red flags.

226
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,620
And I don't even
mean the word "guys,"

227
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,250
which I just learned
is a micro-aggression.

228
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,830
It's fine, "guys."

229
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,670
I will get them
to re-factor their code.

230
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:19,170
We're still ahead
of where we'd be

231
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:21,000
if we were doing
some kind of talent show.

232
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,170
Richard? Gilfoyle parked
his electric pile of trash

233
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,750
in my Tesla's spot.

234
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,960
Do you think that's fair?

235
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,460
Not now, Dinesh.

236
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,290
Why can't you guys
switch to milliseconds?

237
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:31,540
Why do we have to change?

238
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:34,870
Sorry, well, our entire
code base uses nanoseconds.

239
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:37,960
And you didn't think it was
important to tell us this?

240
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,500
No, well, I mean, it was...

241
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,960
it was part of the orientation
that was scheduled,

242
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,250
which had to be,

243
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,210
for numerous reasons,
uh, canceled.

244
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,040
And I'm sorry about that,
I know it sucks.

245
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,420
If I could make it
suck less, I would, but...

246
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,540
You could get some
decent coffee in here.

247
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,330
What? What's wrong with...

248
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,620
Philz Coffee?
That's high-end joe, bro.

249
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,370
At Optimoji, we had Stumptown
brought in every day.

250
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,040
So that would inspire you?
Different coffee?

251
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,960
Inspire us?

252
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,290
You know what?
Bup, bup, bup!

253
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:07,670
Stumptown it is.
You got it.

254
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:10,290
And you'll tell your guys
about the nanoseconds?

255
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,870
Yeah.
Unless you wanna

256
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,750
get up in front of everyone
and announce it yourself.

257
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,120
No, no, no,
I'd rather you...

258
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,330
That was a joke.

259
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,620
Your speech was a disaster.

260
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,790
Oh.
Yeah.

261
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,080
You know. Yeah.

262
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,250
It was really bad.

263
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,250
I know.

264
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,460
Okay, Mr. Jian, you have
petitioned this court

265
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,920
to become the sole executor

266
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,870
of the estate of Erlich Bachman,
is that correct?

267
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,080
Yes.

268
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,920
I see you've got
all the paperwork, here.

269
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,790
Yes. Errich Bachman
is dead.

270
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,750
Oh! Um...

271
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,670
Mr. Jian, there's
absolutely no need

272
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:49,040
to display
the deceased remains.

273
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,750
You can put that away.

274
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,460
I have it.
Yes.

275
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,750
Please put it down.

276
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:01,620
Errich Bachman
is cremated...

277
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,960
into ashes.

278
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,960
And I put it in bucket.

279
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,620
Put it down, sir.

280
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,920
Now, have you determined

281
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,540
to a reasonable
degree of certainty

282
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,120
that Mr. Bachman has
no living next of kin?

283
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,580
No wife,
children, parents,

284
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,790
no brothers, sisters,

285
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,290
nieces, nephews,
grandparents,

286
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:24,960
children from
a predeceased spouse

287
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,960
or domestic partnership?

288
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,210
No.

289
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:29,460
He died alone.

290
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,290
He's a very sad man.

291
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,250
So, I have a...

292
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,670
a house
and a 10% Pied Piper.

293
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,500
In the absence
of any next of kin,

294
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,330
I will approve you
as the sole beneficiary

295
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:45,170
and the official executor
of Mr. Bachman's estate.

296
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:48,210
But, before you can distribute
any of his assets

297
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,710
into your personal possession,

298
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:53,330
you are required to settle all
claims against the estate.

299
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,500
Do you understand?

300
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:58,500
So I get a house
and a 10% Pied Piper?

301
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,540
You need to pay all
of his outstanding bills.

302
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:04,120
How much do I have to pay?

303
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,960
Well, these debts can
sometimes be substantial.

304
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,710
Would you
characterize Mr. Bachman

305
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,830
as a financially
responsible man?

306
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:20,420
Hey, Sliceline guys,
what's up? Heh.

307
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,960
So...

308
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,750
wanted to talk to
you guys about something.

309
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,870
Past couple days,

310
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,000
the Optimoji guys have really
stepped up their game,

311
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,580
but, um, you guys...

312
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:34,710
have kind of been flagging.

313
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:37,040
I'm just wondering if
everything's all right.

314
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,120
Yeah. Great.

315
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,960
Just nice to know
where we stand.

316
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,460
Sorry?
We get it.

317
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,960
You only acquired Sliceline
because you wanted Optimoji.

318
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,920
What?

319
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,210
No, wrong.

320
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:51,210
Uh, why would you say that?

321
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,750
I didn't. You did,

322
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,540
when you chose
their coffee over ours.

323
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,420
It's bad enough
we can't have Slice here.

324
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,420
Slice?

325
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,420
The beverage?

326
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,420
No, no. Slice was our mascot.

327
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,750
He's really smart.

328
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,120
Okay, well...

329
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,460
Bring the little guy in.

330
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,120
What about the no dog policy?

331
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,040
What no dog policy, huh?

332
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,040
Really? Are you sure you don't
need to check with Optimoji?

333
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,040
I'm pretty sure,
but, uh...

334
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,120
Danny? Dan man?

335
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,210
Uh, I just was wondering

336
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:23,330
if you're cool
if the Sliceline guys

337
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:25,420
brought in their dog.
He's really smart.

338
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:28,370
Well at Optimoji,
we had a no dog policy.

339
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:31,040
Come on.
Don't be such a dork.

340
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,580
Let 'em have it.
It's just a dog.

341
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,370
Sure. Fine.

342
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:36,420
You're the CEO.

343
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,170
Yes, I am.

344
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,210
All right.

345
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:41,170
And from this point on,

346
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:44,830
CEO stands for
Canine Endorsement...

347
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:48,330
Oh... yeah.

348
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,830
All right.

349
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:58,040
Hey, look at you
and your 10-speed.

350
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,920
Aw, you got up early 'cause you
thought you could take my space.

351
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,250
That's cute.

352
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,120
Almost as cute as your bike.

353
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,330
Yeah, I guess
this is a bike, isn't it?

354
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,960
So I get to use the bike lane.

355
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,290
See you later.

356
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:17,120
No, bikes still have
to follow traffic laws!

357
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,290
That's not fair!

358
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,370
All right.
You wanna get insane?

359
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,120
Let's get insane.

360
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,000
Whoa!

361
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:31,790
Fuck you, Gilfoyle!

362
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,170
Something's wrong
with your frunk.

363
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:46,580
It's all frucked up.

364
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,960
Hey, Tesla!

365
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,710
You know where Pied Piper is?

366
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,710
Right here, guys.

367
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,000
What the fuck?

368
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,000
Dick?

369
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Hey, uh...

370
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,580
Explain.
Okay, uh...

371
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:10,040
So, Optimoji had
a no dog policy

372
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,000
and apparently that's because
every single one of 'em

373
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,540
have a fucking dog.

374
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,080
And when we waived our
no dog policy...

375
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,790
You waived our no dog policy?

376
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,290
I had Jared put that in there
for a reason, Richard!

377
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:22,210
In Pakistan,
dogs are not pets, okay?

378
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:23,540
They're vicious beasts

379
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,040
and they chase you
down the street

380
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,170
and they bite you.

381
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:28,250
My cousin Eftahar
lost an ear.

382
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,210
Our mayor was
very corrupt.

383
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:32,330
But he put poison pills
in chicken meat

384
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:34,040
to take care
of the dog problem.

385
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,210
We hailed him as a hero.

386
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,870
We put up statues
of him everywhere.

387
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,540
He's gonna be okay.

388
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,290
Who's gonna be okay?

389
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:42,170
What? Stallion down?

390
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:43,830
He's violently
allergic to dogs.

391
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:46,790
It's another reason for our
iron-clad no dog policy.

392
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:49,330
Jared, when were you planning
on telling me all of this?

393
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:51,080
Day two of orientation.

394
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,750
Right after safe space charades.

395
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:56,330
So look, we'll pay for your
entire medical bill, obviously.

396
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,540
So, you're good.

397
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,460
You're covering
his deductible?

398
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,210
Then you have
to cover ours, right?

399
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,000
And what about the dogs?
They're people, too.

400
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,710
They're literally not.

401
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,080
They're dogs!

402
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,920
Hold strong.

403
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,080
Fuck you!

404
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,500
Oh.
So...

405
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,670
Jared, uh, you wanted me
to unite the teams and I have.

406
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,620
They are united against me.

407
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:28,080
Even the dogs,
apparently.

408
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,830
I wish they had
your fecal fortitude.

409
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,540
Hey, do me a favor and...

410
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,920
just take care of all the dogs.

411
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,670
And then call an all-hands.

412
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:42,790
I've clearly gotta
say words.

413
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,080
Ooh, okay.

414
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,960
Really didn't wanna
be back up here, again.

415
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,580
And I think we all
remember why, you know?

416
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:55,210
But you probably don't know
this, but I almost sh...

417
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:56,290
They don't need to...

418
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:57,750
Farted. Yeah.

419
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,920
Which would be embarrassing.

420
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,870
Anyway, look, uh...

421
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,580
I know I...

422
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:08,000
should be the inspiration
for you guys,

423
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,170
but to be honest,
that's not really who I am.

424
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,210
And if this company
lives or dies

425
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:16,290
by all the flowery
things I say,

426
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:18,170
well then, to be honest,
we're fucked. Ha.

427
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:21,540
They say that...

428
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,790
people don't follow ideas.

429
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:26,870
But I think in this case,
you guys should.

430
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:28,620
Because...

431
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:31,040
the idea of creating
a new Internet,

432
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,330
that's special.

433
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:35,580
Right? And we've been
given the opportunity

434
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,750
to rewrite...

435
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:42,290
the most important thing
in human history.

436
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:44,080
And we can build it

437
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,580
the way it should've
been made all along.

438
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:50,870
You know, not this
shitty, addictive parasite

439
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,920
that companies like
Hooli use to spy on us

440
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,870
and exploit us.

441
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:56,870
Okay?

442
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,710
There.
That's your inspiration.

443
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,870
Not me.

444
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:03,580
Not coffee. Not dogs. So...

445
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:07,670
if I'm not inspirational
enough for you,

446
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,120
and if you don't
wanna be here,

447
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,120
well, then,
there's the door.

448
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,710
And we'll give you
enough severance

449
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,330
to cover you to your next job.

450
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:17,500
But if you wanna stick around
and build this thing,

451
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,920
then we've got work to do.

452
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,580
Great job.

453
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,920
So what's going on?
I hear footsteps.

454
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,170
Are... are people
sitting back down, or...?

455
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:33,040
Okay, they're picking
up their bags.

456
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:35,960
That could be good.

457
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,040
Okay. So, what,
they're leaving, or...?

458
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,460
A few are.

459
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,170
Okay, what's a few?

460
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:44,420
It's more than a few.

461
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:47,040
What's that mean? Like,
what's more than a few, five?

462
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,250
Double digits?

463
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,830
It might be easier to say
how many are staying.

464
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,710
It's, uh...

465
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,040
It's two.

466
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,250
What?

467
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,790
Okay.

468
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,080
So, uh,

469
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,830
Richard, what...
what do you wanna do here?

470
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,540
What are you talking about?
I'm doing it.

471
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,750
Sorry?
I'm a coder, Jared.

472
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,170
So I'm gonna code.

473
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:13,500
And if I have to build my entire
new fucking internet by myself,

474
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,500
I'll do that, so...

475
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:19,790
Oh, dear.

476
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,330
I like it.

477
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:24,420
It's just so edgy.

478
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,670
Banksy is a very
edgy artist.

479
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:27,830
The edgiest.

480
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,790
What is this?

481
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:35,790
Banksy is insisting his
signature be on his work.

482
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,790
This is supposed
to be my signature.

483
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:41,460
On what planet does a signature
have a signature on it?

484
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,170
I'm afraid it's
non-negotiable.

485
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:47,920
The fucking balls
on this egomaniac.

486
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,710
You know what?
Fuck Banksy.

487
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:52,460
We're on a campus
full of literally thousands

488
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:55,000
of the greatest
creative minds in the world.

489
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,580
Let's just crowd source it with our
employees. We'll make it a contest.

490
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,620
People will feel empowered
and part of the team.

491
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,250
And it won't cost us shit.

492
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,920
You see? This is what
a benevolent leader does.

493
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,960
Make it happen.

494
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:09,870
Sir, is this a good time?

495
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,920
It's a great time.
I just fired Banksy.

496
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,080
Banksy, the vandal?

497
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,000
The very one. Now,
what do you have for me?

498
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,080
Good news.

499
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,420
I'm hearing that Pied Piper
is in a free-fall.

500
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:23,080
From whom? All I can say
without implicating you

501
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,960
is that I've instituted
an operation

502
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,080
to safeguard our interests.

503
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,620
I'm calling it
"Project Washburn."

504
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,920
What I'm planning to...

505
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,040
Hoover, you're
implicating me.

506
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,540
Are we bad people for leaving
Richard there to work by himself?

507
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,960
We've been coding
for 48 hours straight.

508
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,000
I could give a shit about
deontological ethics.

509
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:49,580
Yang.

510
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:52,420
There better not be
a Chinaman in my bed.

511
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,210
That is racist.

512
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,210
Yes.

513
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:57,370
I am racist.

514
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:03,500
Stupid Errich.

515
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,540
Big mortgage.

516
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,040
Seven credit cards.

517
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,120
Not even one with miles.

518
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,540
Fucking loser.

519
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:15,710
It almost not worth
to take his house from him.

520
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:16,790
Fat fuck.

521
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,080
Speaking of crazy bills,

522
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,580
you know how much it's going
to cost to fix my Tesla?

523
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,420
$17,000.

524
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,870
I can't afford to pay that.

525
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:28,210
But I can't afford
not to pay it.

526
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:29,670
If I don't fix my Tesla,

527
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:30,960
Gilfoyle wins.

528
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,250
And I need to really
shove it up his ass.

529
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,830
Wait.

530
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,420
Do I really hate
someone so much

531
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,580
that defeating them
is worth more than money?

532
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,210
Is that really
what I've become?

533
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,080
Yeah, it is.

534
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,710
I'm gonna pay it.

535
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:46,790
Thanks, Jian-Yang.

536
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,620
I'll pay, too.

537
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:57,250
Fuck you, Errich.

538
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,790
You can't just
leave your bike-car

539
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,420
in my Tesla's spot
and Uber home.

540
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,790
That's not fair, Gilfoyle.

541
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:05,580
Mmm, you don't seem
to understand.

542
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,290
It's my spot now.

543
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:11,750
What are they doing back?

544
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,790
Hey. Where have you been?

545
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,250
Sleeping.

546
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,960
What? All night?

547
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,620
We assumed you guys were right behind us.
What's happening?

548
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,790
Oh!

549
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:23,960
Something.

550
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,620
Something is happening.

551
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,120
When you left,
I thought he was fried.

552
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,790
Okay? Because his shoulders
were all tight,

553
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,670
and he wouldn't answer
to his name,

554
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:32,870
and his eyes went dead,

555
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:34,000
like when I tell him
I love him.

556
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,210
But then, he just got stronger

557
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:37,420
and he started
picking up speed,

558
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,710
so I texted a few
of the Sliceline guys

559
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:42,080
and then they texted
some of the Optimoji guys,

560
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,500
and they all
wanted to see it.

561
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,000
Richard has finished
the scheduler

562
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,290
and is almost
ready to merge

563
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:48,870
the server-less runtime.
Look, look!

564
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:50,830
He implemented
all those tasks?

565
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,500
By himself?

566
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,670
That was supposed to take
the whole team four days.

567
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,670
It's amazing.
I mean, I feel...

568
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:00,000
I feel like Mary Magdalene
on resurrection day.

569
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,500
And that's not
the greatest miracle of all.

570
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,870
Look. Look at the coders.

571
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:07,000
They're all wearing
Pied Piper hoodies.

572
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,540
He pushed another commit.

573
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,620
What the fuck?

574
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,330
Flawless. Right?

575
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:14,460
Um, it takes a while
to read a whole commit.

576
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,540
They've been cheering
after every commit.

577
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,330
I mean, they haven't,
but it's...

578
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,460
it's great.

579
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:28,040
I thought I had
to shit my pants.

580
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,670
So, I crouched.

581
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:32,870
I actually vomited.

582
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:37,750
Fight-or-flight reflex
kicked in and I just...

583
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,120
Richard!

584
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,710
Richard?

585
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,210
Richard?

586
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:46,620
Hey, buddy boy.

587
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:50,000
Oh, there he is.

588
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,370
What's... what's going on?

589
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:53,870
Don't flip out, okay?

590
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:57,250
But you have been
in a coma for four years.

591
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,330
What?

592
00:23:58,330 --> 00:23:59,870
That's correct.

593
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:02,040
In fact,
I'm a robot.

594
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,920
The real Dr. Crawford
died heroically

595
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,790
in the water wars of 2020.

596
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:11,000
Jokes, Richard!

597
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,370
I'm just joking around.

598
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:14,120
What, did you sell
your sense of humor?

599
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,330
You've just been out
for about six hours.

600
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,670
You were not even unconscious,
really just asleep.

601
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:22,670
But you did lose
a whole lot of blood.

602
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,750
I just hope they
put the right kind back in.

603
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,580
Wait, are you
still riffing?

604
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,250
I don't know.

605
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,920
Richard, here's the bad news,

606
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,580
your arms and your torso

607
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,210
took the brunt of the glass.

608
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,580
If you'd cut your face up some,

609
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,080
we could've gotten insurance
to pay for a whole remodel.

610
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,120
Gotta, you know...

611
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,920
give the old schnozzle
a much-needed trim,

612
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,370
you know
what I'm talking about.

613
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:47,500
You gotta hate it
as much as everybody else.

614
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,870
So what happened?
What were you,

615
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:51,420
trying to ride one
of those hover boards

616
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,170
around your office
like a nincompoop?

617
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:54,960
Um, no.

618
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,500
I... I guess I just got
a little lost in the work.

619
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,920
All right.
Hop in, Frankenstein.

620
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,250
Let's get you out of here.

621
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:05,080
Oh, uh...

622
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,000
I think what
you're trying to say is

623
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,290
Frankenstein's monster.

624
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:09,580
What?

625
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,750
I think you mean to call me
Frankenstein's monster

626
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:12,750
'cause Frankenstein is the...

627
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,040
Oh, you're one
of those guys, huh?

628
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,330
No, I'm just... the doctor's
name is Frankenstein...

629
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:18,290
I know. It's just an
annoying thing to point out.

630
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,670
If you want
people to like you,

631
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,330
just go along with what
they say and have fun.

632
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:28,120
What?

633
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,250
Richard!

634
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,870
You should've called.
I would've picked you up.

635
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:33,580
What's everybody doing here?

636
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:34,960
The fuck does it look like?

637
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,960
We're working.

638
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,170
Look at 'em all, Richard.

639
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:39,670
I mean, sure,
a three-day orientation

640
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,500
might've been just as
effective and less bloody,

641
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,750
but it wasn't you.

642
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,580
But you found your own way

643
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:49,000
to get these men and women,
these Pipers, to follow you.

644
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,460
You looked at these people
and you said,

645
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,330
"I may not be
an inspiring speaker.

646
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:54,830
"I may be twitchy,

647
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:56,540
"and I might be strange,

648
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:59,000
"and I might vomit
and I might defecate in my pants

649
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,120
"and I might throw
myself through a window.

650
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,710
"But I believe in
this company so much,

651
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:05,790
I'll work so hard, I'll
literally risk my life for it."

652
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:09,000
And that is the kind of leader
these people wanna follow.

653
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,250
Because now they know
nothing is gonna stop you.

654
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,540
All right, then.

655
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:24,000
Gavin Belson's office, please?

656
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,620
I need to talk to Hoover.
It's Jeff Washburn.

657
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,210
Yes, thank you.

658
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:30,420
This one came in third
with 46 votes.

659
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,710
Cute. Next?

660
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,000
This one came in second
with 374 votes.

661
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Nice, feels solid.

662
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:43,250
And with 9,986 votes this,

663
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:45,710
by far, was Hooli's favorite.

664
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,870
Hmm, I like it.

665
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,210
It's bold.

666
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:58,830
Gavin B.

667
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:01,790
Mr. Hoover?
You have a phone call.

668
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:03,330
He said you'd know
what it was regarding.

669
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,920
A Mr. Jeff Washburn.

670
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,790
I am so exhausted.

671
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,250
But the backseat of my Tesla's

672
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,920
really comfy though,
right, Richard?

673
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,580
Definitely worth all
the money I'm spending on it.

674
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,000
Good purchase.

675
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,370
Not a mistake.

676
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:21,040
Uh...

677
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,500
my key doesn't work.

678
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,250
Uh, let me try mine.

679
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:28,210
What the fuck?

680
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:29,460
Mine doesn't work either.

681
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,290
Yang. Move.

682
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:34,460
Do you have a app idea?

683
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,790
No.

684
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:39,330
Sorry. Errich is gone.

685
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:41,460
This is my incubator now.

686
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,790
What?

687
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,790
Your things are over there.

688
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,500
What the fuck?

689
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,670
You just took our shit
and threw it on the lawn?

690
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:50,830
Gilfoyle,

691
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,460
you are racist.

692
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,620
And Richard...

693
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:55,750
you are ugly.

694
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:58,960
The Errich administration
is over.

695
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,960
What?
What the fuck?

696
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,790
You can't just
kick us out, Jian-Yang.

697
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:06,120
Sorry. You are victims
of a circumstance.

698
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,290
Thank you.

699
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,580
Jian-Yang.

700
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:12,790
What the fuck?

701
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,000
Why does the whole
neighborhood smell like bacon?
