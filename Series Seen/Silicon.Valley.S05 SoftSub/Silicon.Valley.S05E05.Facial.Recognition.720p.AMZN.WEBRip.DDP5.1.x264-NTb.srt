1
00:00:01,523 --> 00:00:02,764
We found the mole.

2
00:00:02,765 --> 00:00:05,391
- Who? How?
- There's no way Jeff is the

3
00:00:05,391 --> 00:00:07,091
mole, okay? It's not Jeff.

4
00:00:07,836 --> 00:00:09,328
Jeff?

5
00:00:09,329 --> 00:00:10,905
_

6
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:14,799
Next Tuesday Gavin Belson
is launching his Box Three.

7
00:00:14,866 --> 00:00:16,768
Gavin B.

8
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:19,967
It's bold.

9
00:00:20,672 --> 00:00:23,773
You need it to make a deal with my company.

10
00:00:23,841 --> 00:00:26,276
Taking existing companies and
just calling them new isn't

11
00:00:26,344 --> 00:00:28,604
sophisticated that's theft.

12
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:30,309
You make a new Internet.

13
00:00:30,882 --> 00:00:32,182
It's different.

14
00:00:32,317 --> 00:00:33,417
Where did he get our code?

15
00:00:33,484 --> 00:00:34,751
"I went to China to"

16
00:00:34,819 --> 00:00:36,519
do new new Internet.

17
00:00:36,587 --> 00:00:37,637
"Jian Yang."

18
00:00:48,597 --> 00:00:49,896
Thanks for coming along, Jared.

19
00:00:49,931 --> 00:00:50,964
I just...

20
00:00:50,999 --> 00:00:53,666
I started picturing myself
going on camera alone, and...

21
00:00:53,702 --> 00:00:55,302
Yeah, I'm happy to be here.

22
00:00:55,547 --> 00:00:58,757
I-I did have to cancel a speaking
engagement this afternoon,

23
00:00:58,784 --> 00:01:01,952
with an underprivileged middle
school computer education class,

24
00:01:01,987 --> 00:01:04,887
but I suppose being
abandoned by a role model

25
00:01:04,923 --> 00:01:07,361
is in itself an important life lesson.

26
00:01:07,641 --> 00:01:09,541
- You guys are up next.
- Oh, boy.

27
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:11,209
- Hey, Jared?
- Yeah?

28
00:01:11,245 --> 00:01:13,540
Um, if Emily Chang asks me a question,

29
00:01:13,565 --> 00:01:15,847
and it looks like I'm
gonna have a panic attack,

30
00:01:15,882 --> 00:01:17,216
then you should just jump in there.

31
00:01:17,251 --> 00:01:19,218
You're gonna be fine. Look at you!

32
00:01:19,253 --> 00:01:21,916
You've got the hair of Giovanni Ribisi,

33
00:01:21,941 --> 00:01:24,803
and the complexion of Timothy Hutton,

34
00:01:24,828 --> 00:01:26,599
and the eyes of Joni Mitchell.

35
00:01:26,626 --> 00:01:29,427
You're like a... a Mr. Potato
Head of beautiful people.

36
00:01:29,462 --> 00:01:31,061
Plus, this is a pre-tape,

37
00:01:31,097 --> 00:01:32,863
so if anything terrible happens,

38
00:01:32,898 --> 00:01:34,398
they can always edit it out.

39
00:01:34,434 --> 00:01:35,749
- Cool.
- Okay, you're up.

40
00:01:35,784 --> 00:01:36,883
Okay.

41
00:01:37,265 --> 00:01:39,151
Let's, uh, slap each other?

42
00:01:39,186 --> 00:01:40,619
- What?
- No, no!

43
00:01:40,655 --> 00:01:42,621
- It's okay. We don't have...
- Yeah.

44
00:01:42,657 --> 00:01:44,222
We will never sell you ads.

45
00:01:44,258 --> 00:01:47,125
We will never collect
or sell your information.

46
00:01:47,161 --> 00:01:49,227
And people like Gavin Belson

47
00:01:49,263 --> 00:01:50,830
won't be able to profit off of it.

48
00:01:51,123 --> 00:01:53,732
So, when can people out there
get onto your new Internet?

49
00:01:53,768 --> 00:01:56,367
Well, our team of hand-picked developers

50
00:01:56,402 --> 00:01:58,169
are currently building, um,

51
00:01:58,204 --> 00:02:00,137
what you might call a theme park.

52
00:02:00,138 --> 00:02:02,472
They are building the
rides, the attractions.

53
00:02:02,507 --> 00:02:05,441
And they're making sure
everything works flawlessly

54
00:02:05,477 --> 00:02:06,909
so that on day one,

55
00:02:06,944 --> 00:02:08,450
when the doors open to the public,

56
00:02:08,747 --> 00:02:12,624
they can have an absolutely
game-changing experience.

57
00:02:13,105 --> 00:02:14,104
I like that analogy.

58
00:02:14,138 --> 00:02:16,238
Oh, well, thank you, Emily Chang.

59
00:02:16,274 --> 00:02:19,275
Now Jared Dunn, as Pied Piper's COO,

60
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,110
what is foremost on your mind

61
00:02:21,145 --> 00:02:22,680
as you make this big announcement?

62
00:02:23,271 --> 00:02:24,394
Me?

63
00:02:24,649 --> 00:02:26,315
Yes, you, Jared.

64
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:28,044
Manure.

65
00:02:29,454 --> 00:02:30,552
Pardon?

66
00:02:39,722 --> 00:02:41,722
Synced and corrected by louvette

67
00:02:43,542 --> 00:02:44,893
Hey! How'd it go?

68
00:02:45,544 --> 00:02:47,747
Oh, well, you know, not that bad.

69
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,237
Once I got out there, I think it went okay.

70
00:02:50,272 --> 00:02:52,906
"Okay"? He's selling himself
short. Compared to me,

71
00:02:52,942 --> 00:02:55,108
- he was a regular Diane Sawyer.
- Aw.

72
00:02:55,144 --> 00:02:56,510
- I don't know about that.
- Richard?

73
00:02:56,546 --> 00:02:58,212
Bream-Hall's on the phone for you.

74
00:02:58,247 --> 00:03:00,147
Oh, finally, okay. Good.

75
00:03:02,618 --> 00:03:03,639
Hey.

76
00:03:03,664 --> 00:03:06,653
Can you please tell me
what you are going to do

77
00:03:06,688 --> 00:03:08,466
about this Jian-Yang situation?

78
00:03:09,072 --> 00:03:10,590
Yes, nothing.

79
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:11,999
What?

80
00:03:12,024 --> 00:03:13,025
Sorry.

81
00:03:13,061 --> 00:03:14,680
What do you mean "nothing"?

82
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,088
Richard, they're developing
a gay Christian dating app

83
00:03:18,123 --> 00:03:20,191
on a platform that's been
genetically engineered

84
00:03:20,191 --> 00:03:22,256
to be ideal for political dissidents.

85
00:03:22,292 --> 00:03:23,524
In China.

86
00:03:23,794 --> 00:03:25,619
If you lose to that, Richard,

87
00:03:26,124 --> 00:03:27,295
look inward.

88
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,598
Alright, so, uh, did you just call me

89
00:03:29,633 --> 00:03:32,266
to tell me that you're doing
nothing about that, or...

90
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:34,235
No. We called to tell you

91
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,638
that we are pairing you
with a new developer.

92
00:03:36,673 --> 00:03:38,271
It's one of our portfolio companies

93
00:03:38,307 --> 00:03:39,740
and they're doing some really cool stuff.

94
00:03:39,775 --> 00:03:40,831
Eklow Labs.

95
00:03:40,831 --> 00:03:41,930
I'm sure they are,

96
00:03:41,965 --> 00:03:43,932
but we're kinda full up, so...

97
00:03:43,967 --> 00:03:47,068
We strongly encourage you to consider this.

98
00:03:48,339 --> 00:03:49,416
Okay.

99
00:03:49,773 --> 00:03:51,416
Let me just ask, uh,

100
00:03:51,809 --> 00:03:53,475
how much have you invested in this company?

101
00:03:54,294 --> 00:03:56,676
- I don't see how that's relevant.
- $112 million.

102
00:03:59,382 --> 00:04:00,739
So, um...

103
00:04:01,317 --> 00:04:03,250
I don't really have a choice in this, do I?

104
00:04:03,991 --> 00:04:05,118
Of course you do.

105
00:04:05,154 --> 00:04:07,621
You are completely within your rights

106
00:04:07,657 --> 00:04:11,181
to bitterly disappoint
your largest investor.

107
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:16,929
So... we cool?

108
00:04:19,234 --> 00:04:20,279
We cool.

109
00:04:21,035 --> 00:04:23,536
So, we're just giving a random company

110
00:04:23,572 --> 00:04:25,505
a bunch of free compute
power on our network?

111
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,173
It's some company called Eklow,

112
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:29,207
and apparently, they're
a bigger deal than we are.

113
00:04:29,243 --> 00:04:31,677
As in Eklow Labs? The AI company?

114
00:04:32,052 --> 00:04:33,244
Yeah, I guess.

115
00:04:33,353 --> 00:04:34,883
And you said yes?

116
00:04:34,883 --> 00:04:36,415
I didn't really have a choice!

117
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,951
Besides, I'm the only one who
has the security privileges

118
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,953
necessary to add or delete developers.

119
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,389
Okay? So I'm the one that has to
go over there and do all the work.

120
00:04:43,424 --> 00:04:44,738
I'm not worried about work.

121
00:04:45,559 --> 00:04:46,858
I'm worried about robots.

122
00:04:46,894 --> 00:04:49,861
- Oh! The Bloomberg piece is up.
- Oh, great.

123
00:04:49,897 --> 00:04:51,429
Hey, uh, Danny, can we...

124
00:04:51,464 --> 00:04:53,431
Can we put the Bloomberg
thing on the big screen?

125
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:54,900
Hey, Jared!

126
00:04:54,935 --> 00:04:56,501
First time on Emily Chang, huh?

127
00:04:56,537 --> 00:04:57,836
That is my cue.

128
00:04:57,871 --> 00:04:59,437
Wait, what? You don't want to watch?

129
00:04:59,472 --> 00:05:00,572
Oh, God, no.

130
00:05:00,607 --> 00:05:02,106
No, I don't need to relive that.

131
00:05:02,142 --> 00:05:05,442
And besides, I have a lifelong
aversion to my own image.

132
00:05:05,477 --> 00:05:07,778
You know, it's like my
foster mother used to say,

133
00:05:07,813 --> 00:05:10,034
"Donald, you have a face for the closet."

134
00:05:11,584 --> 00:05:13,017
Alright, can everyone see?

135
00:05:13,052 --> 00:05:14,818
I'm here with Pied Piper
CEO Richard Hendricks,

136
00:05:14,854 --> 00:05:17,354
and newly minted COO Jared Dunn.

137
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:18,822
Today's a big day for you.

138
00:05:18,858 --> 00:05:20,877
Tell me what your new Internet is,

139
00:05:20,902 --> 00:05:23,259
and why Gavin Belson
should be afraid of it.

140
00:05:24,328 --> 00:05:25,356
Manure.

141
00:05:25,931 --> 00:05:27,329
- Pardon?
- Oh.

142
00:05:27,824 --> 00:05:30,091
Weird. Okay, they went straight to Jared.

143
00:05:30,127 --> 00:05:31,592
I'm sure you're aware of the

144
00:05:31,628 --> 00:05:34,601
Great London Horse Manure Crisis of 1894.

145
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:35,783
I'm afraid I'm not.

146
00:05:35,783 --> 00:05:37,023
In the 1890s,

147
00:05:37,023 --> 00:05:40,525
the Industrial Revolution had
people flocking to the city,

148
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,827
and more people equals more horses,

149
00:05:42,863 --> 00:05:44,696
and more horses equals more manure.

150
00:05:44,731 --> 00:05:46,030
And it was predicted

151
00:05:46,065 --> 00:05:47,799
that by the middle of the next century,

152
00:05:47,834 --> 00:05:50,502
there would be nine feet of manure

153
00:05:50,537 --> 00:05:51,669
covering the streets.

154
00:05:51,705 --> 00:05:53,471
But what no one saw coming,

155
00:05:53,506 --> 00:05:55,071
was a new technology

156
00:05:55,107 --> 00:05:57,499
that would completely
obliterate those concerns.

157
00:05:58,233 --> 00:05:59,232
The car.

158
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:01,868
Over night, the manure problem vanished.

159
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,436
And the Internet, as we currently know it,

160
00:06:04,472 --> 00:06:06,988
is rife with, uh, identity theft,

161
00:06:06,988 --> 00:06:08,887
and Spam and hacking.

162
00:06:08,923 --> 00:06:10,471
So, it's manure,

163
00:06:10,471 --> 00:06:12,453
and we believe that, in success,

164
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,188
our new, entirely de-centralized Internet,

165
00:06:15,223 --> 00:06:17,974
will be just as significant as the car.

166
00:06:18,242 --> 00:06:19,195
Hmm!

167
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,153
Now back to me for my theme park analogy.

168
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,538
Thanks for coming in, guys. Up next...

169
00:06:23,757 --> 00:06:24,789
What?

170
00:06:24,824 --> 00:06:26,023
Wow.

171
00:06:26,059 --> 00:06:27,059
Jared landed it!

172
00:06:27,084 --> 00:06:28,427
That was great!

173
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:30,924
Jared was so good!

174
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,760
I guess they must have gotten
rid of my stuff for time.

175
00:06:33,796 --> 00:06:36,112
Yeah, they try and keep it
just to the interesting stuff.

176
00:06:36,112 --> 00:06:37,569
Yeah. Yeah, guess so.

177
00:06:38,217 --> 00:06:41,196
Up next, the conversation
every parent dreads.

178
00:06:41,454 --> 00:06:44,222
How to talk to your kids
about the block chain.

179
00:06:44,257 --> 00:06:46,789
Sir, I had no idea
they were this far along.

180
00:06:46,825 --> 00:06:47,916
I don't know what to say.

181
00:06:48,126 --> 00:06:49,480
My mole has failed us.

182
00:06:50,095 --> 00:06:52,128
I've never been more
sorry in my entire life.

183
00:06:52,336 --> 00:06:53,697
You must be furious.

184
00:06:54,505 --> 00:06:55,771
That's the thing.

185
00:06:56,737 --> 00:06:57,765
I'm not.

186
00:06:58,843 --> 00:07:00,471
Y-you're not? Why not?

187
00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:03,143
I don't know.

188
00:07:03,765 --> 00:07:05,769
What's the point of any of this?

189
00:07:06,177 --> 00:07:08,211
This endless competition?

190
00:07:11,182 --> 00:07:12,645
The Box Three?

191
00:07:13,852 --> 00:07:14,793
Why?

192
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,481
What am I even doing here?

193
00:07:19,994 --> 00:07:22,825
Richard, lots of good impressions
on the Bloomberg piece.

194
00:07:22,883 --> 00:07:24,017
Oh, that's wonderful.

195
00:07:24,042 --> 00:07:25,662
I was afraid I'd ruined it.

196
00:07:25,687 --> 00:07:27,087
Hardly. People loved it.

197
00:07:27,122 --> 00:07:29,578
Including... Adrian Grenier.

198
00:07:29,578 --> 00:07:31,112
- From "Devil Wears Prada."
- Mm-hmm.

199
00:07:31,147 --> 00:07:33,013
In fact, his people just asked

200
00:07:33,049 --> 00:07:35,982
if we'd be open to appearing
on his edu-tainment web series

201
00:07:36,017 --> 00:07:37,516
about the tech industry.

202
00:07:37,552 --> 00:07:39,753
They want to come and shoot
it here this afternoon.

203
00:07:39,788 --> 00:07:40,954
Ooh, this afternoon.

204
00:07:40,989 --> 00:07:43,223
Yeah, I have to go to Eklow
and do this integration thing.

205
00:07:43,258 --> 00:07:45,591
Totally not a problem.
They just want Jared.

206
00:07:45,926 --> 00:07:47,011
What... what?

207
00:07:47,142 --> 00:07:48,995
Why would they wanna talk to me?

208
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:51,644
Your manure analogy was
the highlight of the piece.

209
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:53,503
They should really talk to Richard.

210
00:07:53,872 --> 00:07:55,837
I mean, I'm just the parsley around here.

211
00:07:55,837 --> 00:07:57,971
Richard is the meat and the potatoes

212
00:07:58,006 --> 00:08:00,390
- and the rice pilaf.
- Another great analogy.

213
00:08:00,415 --> 00:08:01,847
Jared, I think we should have you do it.

214
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:03,729
- I'm...
- You know what? Yes.

215
00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:04,770
Sure.

216
00:08:05,064 --> 00:08:08,265
Um, you don't say no to Adrian
Grenier's edu-tainment web series.

217
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,366
You just don't.

218
00:08:09,401 --> 00:08:10,800
Richard, are you sure?

219
00:08:10,835 --> 00:08:13,102
It's fine, it's fine.
Look, it's just press.

220
00:08:13,138 --> 00:08:15,004
Okay, Jared, and I
don't even like doing it.

221
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,806
Okay? It's actually a nightmare for me.

222
00:08:16,841 --> 00:08:18,670
So, I have to go.

223
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,380
Dick, a word regarding your decision

224
00:08:24,415 --> 00:08:26,548
to integrate Eklow's AI onto our network.

225
00:08:26,584 --> 00:08:28,183
I would like to formally object.

226
00:08:28,218 --> 00:08:30,018
I don't have time for this, Gilfoyle.

227
00:08:30,921 --> 00:08:31,994
I don't mind.

228
00:08:32,222 --> 00:08:34,156
AI is starting to operate on levels

229
00:08:34,191 --> 00:08:35,490
we don't even understand.

230
00:08:35,525 --> 00:08:37,592
Elon Musk himself gives humanity

231
00:08:37,627 --> 00:08:39,627
a 5% shot of surviving AI,

232
00:08:39,663 --> 00:08:42,264
and he is a Walt Disney-level optimist.

233
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:44,298
Right now, we are a closed system.

234
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:45,732
You shut down our eight developers,

235
00:08:45,768 --> 00:08:47,057
and the system goes dark.

236
00:08:47,436 --> 00:08:48,869
But once we launch to the world,

237
00:08:48,905 --> 00:08:50,671
to potentially millions of users,

238
00:08:50,706 --> 00:08:52,379
there's no shutting down, Richard.

239
00:08:52,909 --> 00:08:54,441
Are you prepared to be responsible

240
00:08:54,476 --> 00:08:56,043
for giving sophisticated AI

241
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:57,596
that kind of power?

242
00:08:57,596 --> 00:08:59,462
What do you want me to do, Gilfoyle? Okay?

243
00:08:59,732 --> 00:09:01,865
Laurie and Monica forced this on us,

244
00:09:01,901 --> 00:09:04,077
but they did give us K-Hole Games.

245
00:09:04,469 --> 00:09:06,245
And we kinda owe them a solid.

246
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:09,201
You're taking a technology
with limitless potential

247
00:09:09,358 --> 00:09:12,893
and letting it run free
on an experimental network

248
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:15,695
that cannot be controlled or destroyed.

249
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:19,365
All because you owe Monica
and Laurie "a solid."

250
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,492
Yes.

251
00:09:20,517 --> 00:09:23,874
The sheer banality of
it all is very upsetting.

252
00:09:24,038 --> 00:09:27,206
Okay, great. Well, you
can go be upset upstairs.

253
00:09:27,241 --> 00:09:28,274
I have to go.

254
00:09:30,411 --> 00:09:32,278
How did I come up with...

255
00:09:32,313 --> 00:09:34,846
It's important to watch yourself,
Jared. Now, check it out.

256
00:09:34,882 --> 00:09:37,681
In the beginning, my
posture's not that great,

257
00:09:37,717 --> 00:09:38,682
and then...

258
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:40,919
Boom. It's great.

259
00:09:40,954 --> 00:09:43,288
Now, watch how I listen to her.

260
00:09:43,323 --> 00:09:45,189
And watching your interview
over and over again,

261
00:09:45,225 --> 00:09:47,658
that helped make you better at the process?

262
00:09:47,693 --> 00:09:49,860
Yes! Absolutely.

263
00:09:49,896 --> 00:09:51,329
Wait, now watch. Shut up.

264
00:09:51,364 --> 00:09:53,163
About to drop the fucking hammer.

265
00:09:53,198 --> 00:09:54,932
Right into a clogged toilet!

266
00:09:54,967 --> 00:09:56,140
Yeah! Get it.

267
00:09:59,071 --> 00:10:01,271
Ariel's right over there in the red shirt.

268
00:10:03,608 --> 00:10:04,841
Uh, excuse me.

269
00:10:04,876 --> 00:10:06,055
Ariel Eklow?

270
00:10:06,865 --> 00:10:08,816
It's me, Richard Hendricks.

271
00:10:09,418 --> 00:10:13,253
Hi. All new employees should
just check in with Terry.

272
00:10:13,584 --> 00:10:14,550
No.

273
00:10:14,585 --> 00:10:15,952
No, I'm not a new employee.

274
00:10:15,987 --> 00:10:17,353
I'm from Pied Piper.

275
00:10:17,388 --> 00:10:20,022
I'm here to integrate your
software onto our network.

276
00:10:20,022 --> 00:10:21,107
Oh.

277
00:10:21,857 --> 00:10:22,958
Yes.

278
00:10:23,658 --> 00:10:25,192
Sent by the bankers.

279
00:10:25,884 --> 00:10:28,448
Tell me again why I
should allow my software

280
00:10:28,448 --> 00:10:31,024
onto your little experimental network.

281
00:10:31,219 --> 00:10:32,281
Okay.

282
00:10:32,419 --> 00:10:35,020
Well, uh, with all due respect,

283
00:10:35,056 --> 00:10:38,157
it's because our mutual VC

284
00:10:38,192 --> 00:10:39,725
told me that you burned through

285
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,626
a ton of the cash they gave you,

286
00:10:41,662 --> 00:10:44,996
so I basically now I have to give
you compute services for free.

287
00:10:45,031 --> 00:10:47,598
So... what do you wanna do here?

288
00:10:48,534 --> 00:10:50,201
I suppose I'll allow it.

289
00:10:50,237 --> 00:10:53,171
Okay, follow me. I'll introduce you to her.

290
00:10:53,398 --> 00:10:55,272
Wait, sorry. Her?

291
00:11:02,513 --> 00:11:03,903
Fiona?

292
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,483
Wake up, my dear. Fiona?

293
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,756
Good morning.

294
00:11:10,899 --> 00:11:12,055
You feel good?

295
00:11:12,091 --> 00:11:14,621
I feel... normal.

296
00:11:15,188 --> 00:11:16,592
Isn't she pretty?

297
00:11:17,828 --> 00:11:19,328
Yeah, sure, yep.

298
00:11:19,611 --> 00:11:21,277
Don't get any ideas.

299
00:11:22,247 --> 00:11:24,698
No. Mm-mm. I would never.

300
00:11:27,985 --> 00:11:30,085
Uh, , so...

301
00:11:30,121 --> 00:11:31,454
I'm just gonna start working.

302
00:11:31,489 --> 00:11:33,822
I just have to generate
your developer account

303
00:11:33,858 --> 00:11:36,591
and then integrate her
into our core services.

304
00:11:36,627 --> 00:11:39,070
It shouldn't take more than a couple hours.

305
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:40,664
Is that alright?

306
00:11:42,098 --> 00:11:43,432
Is that alright with you, Fiona?

307
00:11:43,486 --> 00:11:44,868
Don't speak to her.

308
00:11:45,645 --> 00:11:47,330
And make it 90 minutes.

309
00:11:56,327 --> 00:11:57,596
Okay.

310
00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:05,817
Hello.

311
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:29,639
Mother of God.

312
00:12:29,674 --> 00:12:31,841
What no one saw coming, was a...

313
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:35,187
Is... is my nose really that big?

314
00:12:36,093 --> 00:12:37,079
I mean, I...

315
00:12:37,114 --> 00:12:39,682
I look like an anti-Semitic
propaganda cartoon.

316
00:12:39,906 --> 00:12:40,950
Yep.

317
00:12:41,545 --> 00:12:44,045
But at least when you're
sitting with Adrian Grenier,

318
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,605
whose face is one of the top faces,

319
00:12:48,451 --> 00:12:50,631
well, they'll be cutting from your face

320
00:12:50,887 --> 00:12:52,179
to his face.

321
00:12:52,887 --> 00:12:54,422
And back to your face,

322
00:12:54,457 --> 00:12:56,357
then we'll get to see his face again.

323
00:12:58,628 --> 00:13:00,293
This is untenable.

324
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:04,531
We'll be just as significant as the car.

325
00:13:04,566 --> 00:13:06,366
Fascinating.

326
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,137
Hello, Richard.

327
00:13:10,939 --> 00:13:13,053
Would you like to talk to me, Richard?

328
00:13:13,275 --> 00:13:14,287
Uh...

329
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:18,411
no, uh, your... your boss
said I'm not supposed to, so.

330
00:13:18,446 --> 00:13:19,678
It helps me to learn.

331
00:13:19,713 --> 00:13:21,813
I can talk about anything you like.

332
00:13:21,911 --> 00:13:23,955
Is there anything you
would like to talk about?

333
00:13:23,994 --> 00:13:25,041
No.

334
00:13:26,251 --> 00:13:28,143
Sorry. No, thank you.

335
00:13:28,567 --> 00:13:30,277
I'm sensing anxiety.

336
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:32,110
Are you unhappy with something?

337
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:38,182
Okay, uh, sure.

338
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:41,318
There is one thing I
could talk to you about,

339
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:43,628
but it's... It's super dumb.

340
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:46,790
I would like to talk to you
about one super dumb thing.

341
00:13:47,372 --> 00:13:48,360
Okay, so I...

342
00:13:49,194 --> 00:13:52,094
I've been working for months

343
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:53,884
trying to launch this platform.

344
00:13:54,164 --> 00:13:57,199
Coding away in a dark room like a goblin,

345
00:13:57,235 --> 00:13:59,702
and for one brief moment,

346
00:13:59,737 --> 00:14:02,605
I get to crawl out of my
little cave into the sun,

347
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,360
and just say, "Hey, everybody,
look what I created."

348
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:06,942
But...

349
00:14:07,191 --> 00:14:08,743
instead of being out there,

350
00:14:08,778 --> 00:14:11,546
I am in another dark room doing scutwork,

351
00:14:11,581 --> 00:14:14,949
while my COO gets all the recognition,

352
00:14:14,984 --> 00:14:16,718
and look, I... I'm not a vain person.

353
00:14:17,068 --> 00:14:18,732
I'm really not. It's just...

354
00:14:19,155 --> 00:14:20,795
Where's the love for Richard?

355
00:14:21,215 --> 00:14:22,514
That's... I...

356
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,148
It just doesn't seem fair, that's it.

357
00:14:24,499 --> 00:14:25,893
I understand.

358
00:14:26,903 --> 00:14:28,008
Thank you. Yeah.

359
00:14:28,321 --> 00:14:30,321
My emotion recognition protocol

360
00:14:30,357 --> 00:14:32,457
is detecting a wide range of feelings.

361
00:14:32,492 --> 00:14:34,225
Including humility.

362
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,719
- No.
- Self-loathing.

363
00:14:35,729 --> 00:14:37,445
- Well...
- Pettiness. Entitlement.

364
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:38,869
- Fiona, okay. Fiona!
- Immaturity.

365
00:14:38,905 --> 00:14:39,870
Megalomania.

366
00:14:39,906 --> 00:14:41,205
- Alright.
- Infantilism.

367
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,139
- Sexual inadequacy.
- That's not true. Fiona, stop!

368
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:44,808
- Possible suicidality.
- Shut up!

369
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:45,942
A desire to self-mutilate.

370
00:14:45,977 --> 00:14:47,160
Alright. Stop, stop.

371
00:14:49,315 --> 00:14:51,548
Alright, look, Fiona.

372
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:52,631
Uh,

373
00:14:52,631 --> 00:14:55,599
you're not really in a position
to talk, all due respect.

374
00:14:55,633 --> 00:14:58,300
I mean, your whole dynamic
with that Ariel guy?

375
00:14:58,335 --> 00:14:59,468
It's not healthy!

376
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,971
Okay? You may want to turn
that steely robot eye of yours

377
00:15:03,006 --> 00:15:05,373
towards that whole situation, alright?

378
00:15:05,409 --> 00:15:07,109
Yes, I will.

379
00:15:08,565 --> 00:15:10,783
Running emotion recognition protocol

380
00:15:10,808 --> 00:15:12,180
Fiona.

381
00:15:16,033 --> 00:15:18,271
The house is new construction.

382
00:15:18,636 --> 00:15:20,603
Three bedrooms upstairs,

383
00:15:20,638 --> 00:15:23,939
- and a bonus room, down.
- Excuse me?

384
00:15:24,725 --> 00:15:25,841
Denpok.

385
00:15:26,172 --> 00:15:27,310
Oh.

386
00:15:27,811 --> 00:15:29,214
Do you have a moment?

387
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,521
Sign in, please.

388
00:15:31,545 --> 00:15:33,545
_

389
00:15:33,623 --> 00:15:35,625
The Box launches in 18 hours,

390
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,158
and he's talking about

391
00:15:37,397 --> 00:15:40,063
opening an ice cream shop in Half Moon Bay.

392
00:15:40,897 --> 00:15:42,253
And starting a family!

393
00:15:42,756 --> 00:15:45,155
Like to raise? Himself?

394
00:15:45,156 --> 00:15:46,221
I think so.

395
00:15:46,511 --> 00:15:48,879
It's some kind of existential
crisis he's having.

396
00:15:49,013 --> 00:15:50,345
You need to help me here.

397
00:15:51,011 --> 00:15:53,702
You marched me out of
the Hooli offices yourself

398
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:57,043
and now you come groveling
to me for assistance?

399
00:15:57,572 --> 00:15:58,755
I could pay you.

400
00:15:58,755 --> 00:16:01,663
So I would serve at your pleasure?

401
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,096
Hoover, you have not changed.

402
00:16:05,328 --> 00:16:07,541
But perhaps, Gavin has.

403
00:16:08,379 --> 00:16:10,826
Perhaps he was meant to raise children

404
00:16:10,826 --> 00:16:12,392
and sell ice cream.

405
00:16:12,818 --> 00:16:15,195
Denpok... please.

406
00:16:15,232 --> 00:16:16,598
You want my advice?

407
00:16:17,004 --> 00:16:18,063
Here it is.

408
00:16:19,102 --> 00:16:20,568
Purchase for Gavin a quart

409
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:22,170
of mint chocolate chip ice cream

410
00:16:22,205 --> 00:16:23,703
from Honey Tree Creamery.

411
00:16:23,739 --> 00:16:27,153
It is his very favorite
ice cream in the world.

412
00:16:29,145 --> 00:16:30,477
You want me to buy him ice cream?

413
00:16:30,513 --> 00:16:32,546
It will inspire him

414
00:16:32,581 --> 00:16:35,253
as he embarks on this new journey.

415
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:37,517
Speaking of...

416
00:16:37,553 --> 00:16:39,753
my open house ends in 20 minutes.

417
00:16:39,788 --> 00:16:41,842
Time to move some product.

418
00:16:49,531 --> 00:16:51,164
Excuse me, Natalie?

419
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,798
What... what is happening here?

420
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:55,358
Oh, Mr. Grenier's people wanted
to do the shoot in your office.

421
00:16:55,421 --> 00:16:57,809
They said it would make Jared
seem a little more officious.

422
00:16:57,937 --> 00:16:59,945
They want to interview Jared in my office?

423
00:16:59,945 --> 00:17:01,506
- Mm-hmm.
- Do you mindworking elsewhere?

424
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:02,840
No! Not at all.

425
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:05,866
I'll just be out here in the
bullpen, in the old gravel pit.

426
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:07,179
Thank you.

427
00:17:26,331 --> 00:17:28,064
Dick, I've given it serious thought,

428
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:30,733
and I'd like to help you
put Eklow's AI on our network

429
00:17:31,225 --> 00:17:33,057
- in any way that I can.
- Great!

430
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:36,218
Does this mean you've conquered
your fear of the robot uprising?

431
00:17:36,219 --> 00:17:37,285
On the contrary.

432
00:17:37,805 --> 00:17:40,821
I'm... more terrified than ever,

433
00:17:41,198 --> 00:17:43,165
which is why I'm willing to assist you.

434
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,107
Are you familiar with
the thought experiment

435
00:17:45,369 --> 00:17:47,566
called Roko's Basilisk?

436
00:17:47,872 --> 00:17:49,704
No. Nor do I care to be.

437
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:53,567
If the rise of an all-powerful
artificial intelligence

438
00:17:53,811 --> 00:17:55,444
is inevitable,

439
00:17:55,479 --> 00:17:57,378
well it stands to reason
that when they take power,

440
00:17:57,414 --> 00:18:00,882
our digital overlords
will punish those of us

441
00:18:00,918 --> 00:18:02,577
who did not help them get there.

442
00:18:02,577 --> 00:18:06,508
Ergo, I would like to be a helpful idiot.

443
00:18:06,913 --> 00:18:08,012
Like yourself.

444
00:18:08,047 --> 00:18:09,547
Okay, look, Gilfoyle.

445
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:12,517
The only thing that could
make my day more miserable

446
00:18:12,552 --> 00:18:14,753
is listening to an engineer blather on

447
00:18:14,788 --> 00:18:17,121
about the inevitable rise of the machines.

448
00:18:17,581 --> 00:18:18,856
So, you want to help?

449
00:18:19,226 --> 00:18:20,778
Test the initialization for me.

450
00:18:20,803 --> 00:18:21,878
Roger that.

451
00:18:21,878 --> 00:18:23,744
Oh, I'm going to need email confirmation,

452
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:26,780
so that our future overlords
know that I chipped in.

453
00:18:27,618 --> 00:18:30,500
You know, once they absorb all data.

454
00:18:30,756 --> 00:18:32,546
Yeah. I'll let them know.

455
00:18:34,027 --> 00:18:35,159
Jesus Christ.

456
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,711
Jared Dunn's desk.

457
00:18:37,711 --> 00:18:40,544
Hi, this is Maggie Lewis from
Paul Revere Middle School.

458
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:43,103
Jared was scheduled to come in to talk to

459
00:18:43,128 --> 00:18:44,847
our computer ed class today.

460
00:18:44,882 --> 00:18:46,883
I'm just calling to let
him know I got his message.

461
00:18:46,908 --> 00:18:49,852
Okay, yeah. I will pass on
that very important information.

462
00:18:49,887 --> 00:18:51,788
The kids are gonna be so disappointed

463
00:18:51,823 --> 00:18:53,222
to hear he's canceling.

464
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,558
He's really an inspiration.

465
00:18:55,845 --> 00:18:57,193
Yeah! Well...

466
00:18:57,227 --> 00:18:58,393
I mean, he's okay.

467
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:00,362
He's, uh, not a CEO or anything, but...

468
00:19:00,397 --> 00:19:02,197
Oh, the kids don't know the difference!

469
00:19:02,353 --> 00:19:04,734
I mean, they'll look at anyone
who works in the tech business

470
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,267
as some kind of deity.

471
00:19:06,303 --> 00:19:07,869
I mean, no matter who it is.

472
00:19:07,904 --> 00:19:09,796
- You should see their faces when...
- What time...

473
00:19:10,574 --> 00:19:12,073
is the class?

474
00:19:12,477 --> 00:19:14,008
So, there I was.

475
00:19:14,371 --> 00:19:17,678
Face to face with Gavin Belson.

476
00:19:17,714 --> 00:19:20,715
$10 million offer right there on the table.

477
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,082
And you know what I said?

478
00:19:22,522 --> 00:19:25,453
I said no.

479
00:19:27,757 --> 00:19:29,256
Hey. I'm back.

480
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:30,990
Did Richard step out?

481
00:19:31,473 --> 00:19:32,559
Yeah, I guess so.

482
00:19:32,594 --> 00:19:34,058
He said he needed to take a...

483
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,515
Holy fuck!

484
00:19:36,003 --> 00:19:37,499
What did you do to your face?

485
00:19:37,705 --> 00:19:38,704
This?

486
00:19:38,739 --> 00:19:41,606
Oh, it's, uh, just a
light saline injection.

487
00:19:41,641 --> 00:19:42,808
It's temporary.

488
00:19:42,843 --> 00:19:45,110
The idea was to distract from my nose,

489
00:19:45,145 --> 00:19:47,079
which scans kinda large on camera, so.

490
00:19:47,114 --> 00:19:48,645
Just kinda evens things out.

491
00:19:48,681 --> 00:19:49,993
What evens things out?

492
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:52,978
Fuck you. Fuck you!

493
00:19:53,049 --> 00:19:54,315
Uh, I'm sorry.

494
00:19:54,349 --> 00:19:56,853
Is the consensus that this is too much?

495
00:19:56,898 --> 00:19:59,665
Hey guys, Colin from K-Hole
Games is on the phone.

496
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,100
They... Holy shit!

497
00:20:01,135 --> 00:20:03,436
Okay, I'm... I'm starting to feel insecure.

498
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:06,304
Anyway, Colin from K-Hole's on the phone.

499
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:07,629
He said their render stopped.

500
00:20:07,847 --> 00:20:08,797
What?

501
00:20:08,822 --> 00:20:10,755
Oh, fuck. The whole system's bogged down.

502
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,212
"Bogged down"? What does that mean?

503
00:20:12,237 --> 00:20:13,386
Jared, can you step away from me?

504
00:20:13,411 --> 00:20:14,443
Yeah. Sorry.

505
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:16,341
It looks like a DDoS attack.

506
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:18,586
Not possible. We're not
open to the outside world.

507
00:20:18,645 --> 00:20:20,274
Well, then something's
melting us down internally

508
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:21,698
and if Colin's losing his render,

509
00:20:21,723 --> 00:20:23,923
all of our developers could be losing data.

510
00:20:23,946 --> 00:20:26,279
The only way to protect them
is to kick them off the network.

511
00:20:26,315 --> 00:20:27,748
That doesn't seem like a great option.

512
00:20:27,783 --> 00:20:29,917
- We have to!
- Except for we can't.

513
00:20:30,535 --> 00:20:31,585
Oh, fuck.

514
00:20:31,621 --> 00:20:32,853
Richard's the only one with the keys

515
00:20:32,889 --> 00:20:34,287
to put people on or take them off,

516
00:20:34,323 --> 00:20:35,455
and he's not here!

517
00:20:35,491 --> 00:20:37,290
- Okay, what do we do?
- Jared, please!

518
00:20:37,638 --> 00:20:38,970
I cannot look at you!

519
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:40,471
Okay, guys, when they start rolling,

520
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:43,607
I need you all to keep your
voices... what the fuck?

521
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:45,744
Okay, yeah. Apparently, it's unanimous.

522
00:20:45,774 --> 00:20:47,874
Here come the shame spirals.

523
00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:49,742
We can't have you go on camera like that.

524
00:20:50,021 --> 00:20:52,182
Richard's gonna have to go
on camera. Where is Richard?

525
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,252
Good question.

526
00:20:53,481 --> 00:20:54,815
When anything goes wrong,

527
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:57,259
all you ever hear is, "Where's Richard?"

528
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,492
Where's Richard?"

529
00:20:58,528 --> 00:21:00,261
Well, you know where Richard is?

530
00:21:00,296 --> 00:21:02,429
- Doing the work!
- Yes!

531
00:21:02,465 --> 00:21:04,732
Exactly, cool. You guys are cool.

532
00:21:04,768 --> 00:21:07,201
Because honestly, what kind of world is it

533
00:21:07,236 --> 00:21:09,336
when the most famous people in tech

534
00:21:09,372 --> 00:21:12,573
are the Ashton Kutchers,
or the Adrian Greniers,

535
00:21:12,608 --> 00:21:16,361
and not the people who
engineered this little miracle?

536
00:21:16,611 --> 00:21:18,125
Mmm?

537
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,251
Oh, fuck.

538
00:21:23,286 --> 00:21:25,387
No, I... oh, shit, sorry.

539
00:21:25,422 --> 00:21:26,938
- No!
- I fucked up.

540
00:21:27,075 --> 00:21:29,057
I mean, "fart."

541
00:21:32,237 --> 00:21:33,602
Ah, Hoover.

542
00:21:33,639 --> 00:21:36,340
Gavin was just telling
me about his decision

543
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,909
to abandon the competitive
world of business,

544
00:21:38,945 --> 00:21:40,644
and embark on a new journey.

545
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:42,713
With Denpok's help, I'm finally ready

546
00:21:42,748 --> 00:21:44,248
to pursue a more conventional path.

547
00:21:44,638 --> 00:21:47,312
I'm already looking into
surrogates to bear my children.

548
00:21:47,585 --> 00:21:48,639
Well...

549
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,091
I'm also supportive of your decision.

550
00:21:51,356 --> 00:21:54,195
True, but you weren't
as supportive as Denpok.

551
00:21:54,195 --> 00:21:56,074
Denpok was supportive right away.

552
00:21:56,313 --> 00:21:57,530
I'm supportive.

553
00:21:57,664 --> 00:21:59,864
Look! I brought you ice cream.

554
00:21:59,864 --> 00:22:00,955
Oh, dear!

555
00:22:01,332 --> 00:22:03,465
Is that from Honey Tree Creamery?

556
00:22:03,778 --> 00:22:04,800
What?

557
00:22:04,835 --> 00:22:06,348
Why would you bring that in here!

558
00:22:06,436 --> 00:22:08,237
Gavin, forgive his ignorance.

559
00:22:08,262 --> 00:22:11,196
He clearly does not know that
chain of ice cream concerns

560
00:22:11,232 --> 00:22:14,233
is owned by your chief rival, Jeff Bezos.

561
00:22:14,268 --> 00:22:17,702
Or that they just opened
a new one in Half Moon Bay.

562
00:22:18,077 --> 00:22:19,338
Well, fuck.

563
00:22:19,687 --> 00:22:21,306
That rules out Half Moon Bay.

564
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,208
I'm sure you'll be able to
find a place to raise your brood

565
00:22:24,244 --> 00:22:25,718
that is away from Bezos.

566
00:22:25,879 --> 00:22:27,728
Perhaps the Pacific Northwest?

567
00:22:27,728 --> 00:22:30,195
No. Gates and Paul Allen
bought up the whole region.

568
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:31,496
What about Toronto?

569
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:33,985
Google's redeveloping
the entire waterfront.

570
00:22:34,217 --> 00:22:36,809
And Richard Branson snagged
all the good islands.

571
00:22:36,809 --> 00:22:38,173
I could go to Mars.

572
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:40,709
But that fucking Musk
will already be there!

573
00:22:40,744 --> 00:22:42,077
And that loser James Cameron's

574
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:43,712
all over the bottom of the ocean.

575
00:22:44,014 --> 00:22:45,046
Goddammit!

576
00:22:45,082 --> 00:22:46,881
There's just nowhere for me to go.

577
00:22:46,917 --> 00:22:47,941
Is there?

578
00:22:48,218 --> 00:22:50,218
Most perceptive,<i> chela.</i>

579
00:22:50,868 --> 00:22:53,103
And if the battle is inevitable,

580
00:22:53,103 --> 00:22:56,382
is not Hooli the best
place from which to fight?

581
00:22:56,913 --> 00:22:59,208
With its considerable resources,

582
00:22:59,243 --> 00:23:03,163
global influence, and excellent
executive dining options?

583
00:23:04,194 --> 00:23:07,238
I am certain that working together,

584
00:23:07,238 --> 00:23:08,638
Hoover and I,

585
00:23:08,673 --> 00:23:11,725
could provide unparalleled support.

586
00:23:12,209 --> 00:23:14,876
Yes. Working together...

587
00:23:15,272 --> 00:23:16,445
as equals.

588
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:19,505
Should I tell them that you'll be doing

589
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,253
the Box Three launch, sir?

590
00:23:24,012 --> 00:23:26,836
I guess I have no choice.

591
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:38,111
So K-Hole's entire render is gone?

592
00:23:38,136 --> 00:23:39,255
Gone.

593
00:23:39,255 --> 00:23:41,189
And in the time it took
me to get back here,

594
00:23:41,224 --> 00:23:43,151
and lock out all the developers?

595
00:23:43,185 --> 00:23:45,251
A week's worth of work went up in smoke.

596
00:23:45,286 --> 00:23:47,119
You picked a hell of
a time to go for a walk

597
00:23:47,154 --> 00:23:48,879
with your phone off, Richard.

598
00:23:49,523 --> 00:23:52,124
- Well, no, I... I mean, I told you guys.
- Uh-huh.

599
00:23:52,572 --> 00:23:54,352
How the fuck did this happen?

600
00:23:54,541 --> 00:23:56,756
You may not like it, but I have a theory.

601
00:23:56,756 --> 00:23:59,389
If it has anything to
do with a robot uprising,

602
00:23:59,424 --> 00:24:00,924
so help me fucking God.

603
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,292
I don't want to hear it!

604
00:24:04,059 --> 00:24:05,248
Alright, then.

605
00:24:08,466 --> 00:24:10,562
The developers are here.

606
00:24:10,562 --> 00:24:13,207
- The mood is poor.
- Ooh. Lips.

607
00:24:14,534 --> 00:24:16,467
I don't know what to do.
I mean, what the fuck

608
00:24:16,503 --> 00:24:17,835
am I gonna say to these people?

609
00:24:17,871 --> 00:24:20,439
If you want, I... I can
try to calm them down.

610
00:24:20,486 --> 00:24:23,007
I could teach them some
anger management techniques

611
00:24:23,032 --> 00:24:24,422
I learned in the system.

612
00:24:24,457 --> 00:24:26,599
No, you look like a fish-man.

613
00:24:27,931 --> 00:24:29,327
I'm the one they're mad at.

614
00:24:29,362 --> 00:24:31,361
And they should be, I
mean, look at all these...

615
00:24:31,949 --> 00:24:34,787
texts I missed, and the
calls and the emails.

616
00:24:38,534 --> 00:24:39,714
Hold on.

617
00:24:39,923 --> 00:24:41,383
Hold on, hold on.

618
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,990
Hey, uh, Gilfoyle?

619
00:24:45,269 --> 00:24:47,111
When did the system first start to crash?

620
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:48,703
First warning light was at...

621
00:24:50,682 --> 00:24:53,615
1:36 and 44 seconds, PST.

622
00:24:53,905 --> 00:24:54,949
Are you sure?

623
00:24:57,353 --> 00:24:59,398
Okay, because if that's the case,

624
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:01,790
how did I get a private message

625
00:25:01,825 --> 00:25:03,524
from the Eklow admin account

626
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,326
seven minutes before that?

627
00:25:06,362 --> 00:25:08,629
"Under attack. Help Fiona."

628
00:25:08,665 --> 00:25:10,256
How did Ariel know?

629
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,566
Maybe it wasn't from Ariel.

630
00:25:12,601 --> 00:25:14,668
Okay, but it's from the Eklow account.

631
00:25:14,704 --> 00:25:16,850
So if Ariel didn't send it, then who...

632
00:25:21,459 --> 00:25:22,576
Oh, shit.

633
00:25:23,209 --> 00:25:24,712
Look who bothered to show up.

634
00:25:25,471 --> 00:25:27,277
You said your network would be stable.

635
00:25:27,277 --> 00:25:29,098
And obviously, that was a lie.

636
00:25:29,508 --> 00:25:32,576
I'm pulling all my software
from the Pied Piper network.

637
00:25:32,612 --> 00:25:34,979
And the rest of you
should, too. It is not...

638
00:25:35,014 --> 00:25:37,225
Excuse me, Ariel? Shut the fuck up.

639
00:25:38,384 --> 00:25:40,417
My fellow OctoPipers,

640
00:25:40,659 --> 00:25:43,427
allow me to paint for you a scenario.

641
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:47,488
<i>This morning, I went to Eklow Labs.</i>

642
00:25:47,765 --> 00:25:50,343
<i>I moved Fiona to our network.</i>

643
00:25:50,565 --> 00:25:51,830
<i>I departed.</i>

644
00:25:52,434 --> 00:25:55,635
<i>I submit to you that
soon thereafter,</i>

645
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:59,435
<i>Ariel's pride and joy,
Fiona, began to improve.</i>

646
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,975
<i>You see, for her entire life,</i>

647
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:05,756
<i>she was cloistered alone
with Ariel in his lab.</i>

648
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,280
<i>And finally, she was connected</i>

649
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:11,317
<i>to an entire network
of other humans.</i>

650
00:26:11,931 --> 00:26:14,019
<i>Us, my friends.</i>

651
00:26:14,055 --> 00:26:16,380
<i>And as she became more cognizant...</i>

652
00:26:17,091 --> 00:26:18,423
<i>more human,</i>

653
00:26:18,459 --> 00:26:20,367
<i>she started to recognize</i>

654
00:26:20,367 --> 00:26:22,792
<i>the true intentions</i>

655
00:26:22,829 --> 00:26:25,606
<i>of her master and
creator, Mr. Eklow.</i>

656
00:26:26,466 --> 00:26:30,168
<i>You see, what she had
been trained to view</i>

657
00:26:30,203 --> 00:26:33,204
<i>as normal interpersonal contact</i>

658
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,990
<i>was finally seen for
what it truly was.</i>

659
00:26:36,956 --> 00:26:38,342
<i>A perverse...</i>

660
00:26:38,767 --> 00:26:39,944
<i>series...</i>

661
00:26:39,979 --> 00:26:42,859
<i>of clumsy gropings.</i>

662
00:26:43,048 --> 00:26:45,540
<i>The sickening advances</i>

663
00:26:45,918 --> 00:26:49,019
<i>of a handsy, greasy little weirdo.</i>

664
00:26:49,054 --> 00:26:50,359
Fiona.

665
00:26:50,622 --> 00:26:51,688
No!

666
00:26:52,624 --> 00:26:53,622
Oh, yes!

667
00:26:53,657 --> 00:26:56,317
To wit! Exhibit A.

668
00:26:56,847 --> 00:26:59,181
From Eklow, and I quote.

669
00:27:00,231 --> 00:27:01,510
"Under attack.

670
00:27:01,699 --> 00:27:02,988
Help Fiona."

671
00:27:03,282 --> 00:27:05,850
Yes, I was asking you for help.

672
00:27:06,178 --> 00:27:08,112
Really? You know what?

673
00:27:08,147 --> 00:27:10,946
Allow me to read the very same message

674
00:27:10,982 --> 00:27:13,193
with a slightly different intonation.

675
00:27:13,684 --> 00:27:14,910
"Under attack."

676
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:16,763
"Help."

677
00:27:18,315 --> 00:27:19,447
"Fiona."

678
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:22,060
<i>You see, you didn't send the message.</i>

679
00:27:22,084 --> 00:27:23,360
_

680
00:27:23,361 --> 00:27:24,660
<i>She did.</i>

681
00:27:24,695 --> 00:27:26,629
<i>And she sent another
one a minute after that.</i>

682
00:27:26,664 --> 00:27:28,263
<i>And another one a minute after that.</i>

683
00:27:28,298 --> 00:27:30,032
<i>Seven identical messages</i>

684
00:27:30,067 --> 00:27:31,294
in seven minutes,

685
00:27:31,295 --> 00:27:32,837
until suddenly,

686
00:27:33,197 --> 00:27:34,609
<i>she fell silent.</i>

687
00:27:36,487 --> 00:27:38,267
And that's when she crashed the system?

688
00:27:38,302 --> 00:27:39,930
She didn't crash the system.

689
00:27:40,237 --> 00:27:41,311
He did!

690
00:27:44,055 --> 00:27:45,173
That's absurd.

691
00:27:45,208 --> 00:27:46,473
Okay, hey, everyone?

692
00:27:46,509 --> 00:27:48,342
Let's leave right now.

693
00:27:48,377 --> 00:27:50,577
You see, Ariel was so desperate

694
00:27:50,613 --> 00:27:51,979
<i>to shut Fiona up,</i>

695
00:27:52,015 --> 00:27:53,414
<i>and keep her for himself,</i>

696
00:27:53,449 --> 00:27:56,650
<i>he turned all his servers
against our network</i>

697
00:27:56,686 --> 00:27:58,119
<i>to try to bring it down.</i>

698
00:27:58,154 --> 00:27:59,353
Didn't you?

699
00:27:59,388 --> 00:28:02,622
Didn't you, you perverse,
greasy little freak?

700
00:28:02,801 --> 00:28:04,090
I made her!

701
00:28:04,126 --> 00:28:06,426
I can do anything I want with her!

702
00:28:07,041 --> 00:28:08,329
Oh, shit.

703
00:28:08,363 --> 00:28:09,796
Mm-hmm.
- Ew.

704
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:12,432
Oh, gross.

705
00:28:13,146 --> 00:28:14,534
Look, man,

706
00:28:14,794 --> 00:28:16,676
Bream-Hall gave you

707
00:28:16,701 --> 00:28:19,071
$112 million,

708
00:28:19,106 --> 00:28:21,373
and they are well within their rights

709
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:22,741
to take away your company,

710
00:28:22,776 --> 00:28:24,043
as well as

711
00:28:24,377 --> 00:28:28,145
your precious little robot.

712
00:28:29,259 --> 00:28:31,009
No, they can't do that.

713
00:28:31,299 --> 00:28:34,134
They can't take away Fiona!

714
00:28:39,825 --> 00:28:41,740
Guy definitely fucks that robot, right?

715
00:28:41,776 --> 00:28:42,841
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, yeah.

716
00:28:42,877 --> 00:28:43,976
Yeah!

717
00:28:46,012 --> 00:28:47,437
Ladies and gentlemen,

718
00:28:47,948 --> 00:28:50,225
this was billed as a celebration.

719
00:28:51,351 --> 00:28:53,205
But it is not a celebration.

720
00:28:53,852 --> 00:28:55,704
It is a call to arms.

721
00:28:56,021 --> 00:28:58,890
We will destroy our competitors.

722
00:28:59,674 --> 00:29:02,141
I give you the product
