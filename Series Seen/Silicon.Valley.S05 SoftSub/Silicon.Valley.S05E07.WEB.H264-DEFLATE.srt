1
00:00:00,289 --> 00:00:01,284
Richard...

2
00:00:01,726 --> 00:00:04,459
Do you think if I asked
they would let me visit her?

3
00:00:04,562 --> 00:00:06,128
Jared, she's going to be okay.

4
00:00:06,398 --> 00:00:07,630
I promise.

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,866
_

6
00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:13,100
The brilliant little idiot.

7
00:00:13,202 --> 00:00:14,769
He found a way around the patent.

8
00:00:14,871 --> 00:00:16,986
It's Hendricks' Internet, but
it's not Hendricks' Internet.

9
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:19,530
I will no longer be able
to manufacture your boxes.

10
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:23,091
You see, my company will be
manufacturing a new device

11
00:00:23,193 --> 00:00:25,526
that will quickly render yours obsolete.

12
00:00:27,534 --> 00:00:29,968
Did you speak to Laurie about our series B?

13
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,232
Sort of.

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,265
Nothing is personal with Laurie, alright?

15
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:35,901
It's what makes her such a great VC.

16
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:38,512
A term sheet for your series B.

17
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:39,981
Congratulations, Richard.

18
00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:41,605
Thank you.

19
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:53,311
<i>Wow. That is one</i> <i>expensive bottle.</i>

20
00:00:53,346 --> 00:00:54,546
You guys deserve the best

21
00:00:54,581 --> 00:00:55,947
bottle of champagne they have.

22
00:00:55,982 --> 00:00:58,218
Yeah, all champagne
tastes the same to me, so.

23
00:00:58,452 --> 00:00:59,917
I agree, I mean, what's the difference

24
00:00:59,953 --> 00:01:02,133
between good champagne and bad champagne?

25
00:01:02,134 --> 00:01:03,632
About $500.

26
00:01:03,667 --> 00:01:05,301
Guys, come on. Enjoy it.

27
00:01:05,336 --> 00:01:07,937
You're about to close
a $30 million series B.

28
00:01:07,972 --> 00:01:09,738
And you don't have to sell any ads

29
00:01:09,774 --> 00:01:11,040
or harvest user data,

30
00:01:11,075 --> 00:01:12,674
which for any other VC in town

31
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,010
would've been a non-starter.

32
00:01:14,045 --> 00:01:16,141
Frankly, I'm surprised
that Laurie went for it.

33
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:17,867
Well, I'm not wild about the idea

34
00:01:17,903 --> 00:01:19,939
of her having two more board seats.

35
00:01:20,174 --> 00:01:23,308
I mean, she did kill
Fiona right in front of us.

36
00:01:23,344 --> 00:01:25,377
Listen, don't worry about Laurie, okay?

37
00:01:25,412 --> 00:01:26,845
I'm gonna be your point person on this.

38
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,381
She's got her plate full.
She's raising money to recover

39
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:30,756
from the whole Eklow debacle.

40
00:01:30,915 --> 00:01:31,847
Okay.

41
00:01:31,872 --> 00:01:33,871
So... to you guys.

42
00:01:34,436 --> 00:01:35,519
All right.

43
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:36,753
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

44
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:37,888
Yup, thanks.

45
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:44,595
All right. I have a dinner meeting

46
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,464
and I kind of feel like a fifth wheel,

47
00:01:46,499 --> 00:01:49,551
so I'm gonna pick up the
check, leave you to celebrate.

48
00:01:49,668 --> 00:01:50,995
- Congrats again, guys.
- Okay.

49
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:52,931
Bye.

50
00:01:57,377 --> 00:01:59,810
Well, the only person we don't spend

51
00:01:59,845 --> 00:02:01,694
20 hours a day with just left.

52
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,687
So.

53
00:02:04,654 --> 00:02:06,254
What's new with you guys?

54
00:02:08,621 --> 00:02:12,222
Well, I'm thinking of buying
some new bookkeeping software.

55
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,791
All right. I think the
only actual way to celebrate

56
00:02:14,827 --> 00:02:17,227
is to spend one waking minute apart, so.

57
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,261
I'm gonna go.

58
00:02:18,296 --> 00:02:20,263
Are you going home?
Let's... let's share an Uber.

59
00:02:20,298 --> 00:02:21,698
Oh, well, if you're going that direction,

60
00:02:21,734 --> 00:02:23,133
I'm... I'm driving, so I could drop you.

61
00:02:23,168 --> 00:02:24,435
Hey, Gilfoyle. Wanna play Fortnite?

62
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,156
Oh, hold on, I didn't know
we were playing Fortnite.

63
00:02:26,156 --> 00:02:27,373
Yeah, I'll come along.

64

Synced and corrected by louvette

65
00:02:43,522 --> 00:02:45,943
I would've taken that
plate to the sink for you.

66
00:02:46,224 --> 00:02:48,464
Uh, it's okay. I just finished, so.

67
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:50,727
How was the sandwich I
made you? Was it good?

68
00:02:50,762 --> 00:02:52,145
Good condiment blend?

69
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:53,897
Yeah. It was perfect, thanks.

70
00:02:53,932 --> 00:02:55,064
Richard.

71
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:56,766
This might be out of line, but...

72
00:02:56,934 --> 00:02:59,822
would you mind telling Jared how
much you enjoyed the sandwich?

73
00:02:59,938 --> 00:03:01,738
I'm finding him a little intimidating.

74
00:03:01,773 --> 00:03:04,774
Sure, yeah. Look, I know he
can be a little eccentric.

75
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,543
I tend to hold my breath around him.

76
00:03:06,578 --> 00:03:08,244
It's exacerbating my asthma.

77
00:03:08,818 --> 00:03:10,178
Ooh, okay...

78
00:03:10,504 --> 00:03:12,328
Richard, do you have a moment?

79
00:03:15,808 --> 00:03:16,925
You know what?

80
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:20,302
Holden just made me a really good sandwich.

81
00:03:20,647 --> 00:03:22,795
Oh, well, that's nice.

82
00:03:23,183 --> 00:03:24,215
Yeah. Yep.

83
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:30,394
Did he ask you to mention that to me?

84
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:32,846
What? No.

85
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,120
- Okay.
- No, he's... he's just great.

86
00:03:37,564 --> 00:03:39,830
Well, "In doing what we
ought, we deserve no praise"

87
00:03:39,866 --> 00:03:41,162
because it is our duty."

88
00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:42,427
St. Augustine.

89
00:03:43,392 --> 00:03:44,624
So, um...

90
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,637
I've been keeping track
of the compute credits

91
00:03:46,672 --> 00:03:47,871
that you gave to Laurie.

92
00:03:47,906 --> 00:03:49,706
And she sold them to Gigglybots

93
00:03:49,741 --> 00:03:51,988
and then Gigglybots sold them to SmashHub.

94
00:03:52,244 --> 00:03:54,010
And they traded hands a few more times,

95
00:03:54,046 --> 00:03:56,313
the price increasing
each time until they were

96
00:03:56,348 --> 00:03:58,625
bought by a venture fund in Mountain View.

97
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,151
Okay, uh, so if we wanted to buy them back,

98
00:04:01,176 --> 00:04:02,575
how much would it cost us?

99
00:04:02,854 --> 00:04:05,289
It's $1.6 million.

100
00:04:05,324 --> 00:04:07,191
- What?
- The fuck?

101
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,462
- More like that?
- Yeah.

102
00:04:11,575 --> 00:04:13,175
So Dinesh, is it true?

103
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,464
Is series B happening?

104
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,618
We all heard it's happening.

105
00:04:15,792 --> 00:04:18,068
Oh, guys, please, you
know I can't talk to you

106
00:04:18,103 --> 00:04:19,635
about upper level management stuff.

107
00:04:19,671 --> 00:04:21,805
It's totally happening. Look at his face.

108
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,094
He has the worst poker face.

109
00:04:23,119 --> 00:04:25,175
No. Don't... Don't look at my face.

110
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:28,082
This is great news. We're
all getting big, fat bonuses.

111
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:30,947
I was a little worried I made
a mistake ordering that Tesla.

112
00:04:31,764 --> 00:04:33,249
Sorry, Tesla? What Tesla?

113
00:04:33,284 --> 00:04:35,146
Model S. Same as yours.

114
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,584
I mean, not exactly the
same. I ordered the P100D.

115
00:04:38,609 --> 00:04:39,655
Newer model.

116
00:04:39,691 --> 00:04:40,957
It's got longer battery life...

117
00:04:40,992 --> 00:04:42,759
You know what? This is a workplace.

118
00:04:42,794 --> 00:04:45,261
This is not a fucking slumber
party, gabbing, gabbing.

119
00:04:45,296 --> 00:04:47,197
And series B is not a done deal.

120
00:04:47,232 --> 00:04:49,682
Despite what my face says, okay?

121
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:50,869
Don't trust this face.

122
00:04:50,894 --> 00:04:52,851
No one should ever trust this face.

123
00:04:54,004 --> 00:04:55,575
Congrats on the Tesla, Danny.

124
00:04:55,773 --> 00:04:56,991
So excited for you.

125
00:04:58,664 --> 00:05:00,329
Series B, baby!

126
00:05:00,457 --> 00:05:01,623
Fuck Danny.

127
00:05:01,892 --> 00:05:03,459
I mean, I love my Tesla.

128
00:05:03,484 --> 00:05:04,547
It has Insane Mode,

129
00:05:04,582 --> 00:05:08,351
which means it goes zero
to 60 in 3.2 seconds,

130
00:05:08,386 --> 00:05:10,085
which is literally insane.

131
00:05:10,121 --> 00:05:13,756
But the Tesla that Danny
ordered has Ludicrous Mode,

132
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:17,293
which means it goes zero
to 60 in 2.8 seconds.

133
00:05:17,328 --> 00:05:19,179
So it's gonna take me an entire

134
00:05:19,204 --> 00:05:21,554
0.4 seconds longer to get to 60.

135
00:05:22,414 --> 00:05:24,281
I mean, how would you feel
if one of your neighbors

136
00:05:24,316 --> 00:05:26,027
got a tiki head bigger than yours?

137
00:05:27,018 --> 00:05:29,553
Oh, well, when we bought it,

138
00:05:29,588 --> 00:05:32,012
we made sure it was the
biggest one they made, so.

139
00:05:32,037 --> 00:05:34,545
You're the biggest tiki
head guy in the neighborhood.

140
00:05:35,527 --> 00:05:37,641
I used to be the Tesla guy in the office.

141
00:05:37,862 --> 00:05:40,763
I maxed out my credit cards to
be able to afford that thing.

142
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:42,326
And now that we're getting series B,

143
00:05:42,352 --> 00:05:45,435
any one of these bourgeois
new money millennial fucks

144
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,032
can just go out and buy one.

145
00:05:47,724 --> 00:05:49,424
I don't wanna sound selfish,

146
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:52,939
but sometimes I wish only
I made money. You know?

147
00:05:53,595 --> 00:05:54,787
What are we talking about, here?

148
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:57,188
You want us to launch a cryptocurrency?

149
00:05:57,188 --> 00:05:58,287
I do.

150
00:05:58,322 --> 00:06:00,455
The fact that people are willing
to pay many multiples more

151
00:06:00,491 --> 00:06:02,457
for our compute credits than they're worth,

152
00:06:02,493 --> 00:06:04,085
we have an opportunity here.

153
00:06:04,528 --> 00:06:05,927
Worth is relative, Richard.

154
00:06:06,091 --> 00:06:07,128
What do you mean?

155
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,997
Why do people covet

156
00:06:09,032 --> 00:06:12,601
the silly pieces of green
cotton paper in their wallets?

157
00:06:12,636 --> 00:06:15,082
It's because we are all sheep.

158
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:18,363
And we've mutually agreed
to endow certain things

159
00:06:18,388 --> 00:06:19,526
with value.

160
00:06:19,882 --> 00:06:22,189
And right now, for some reason,

161
00:06:22,317 --> 00:06:25,753
the market values our
credits more than we did.

162
00:06:25,788 --> 00:06:27,621
Gilfoyle, we're not gonna suddenly pivot

163
00:06:27,656 --> 00:06:29,304
and become a digital currency company.

164
00:06:29,304 --> 00:06:30,657
I'm not proposing a pivot.

165
00:06:30,693 --> 00:06:32,921
I'm proposing that we sell digital currency

166
00:06:32,921 --> 00:06:35,621
as a way to finance our
new Internet company.

167
00:06:36,024 --> 00:06:38,763
You wanted an alternative to Laurie Bream.

168
00:06:39,561 --> 00:06:41,070
Well, it's right here in front of you.

169
00:06:41,429 --> 00:06:43,362
PiedPiperCoin.

170
00:06:43,398 --> 00:06:44,822
Okay, look, I...

171
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,638
I'm not gonna bet the entire future

172
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:50,617
of my new Internet and
everything I've worked for

173
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:52,944
on becoming the next Bitcoin.

174
00:06:53,238 --> 00:06:54,889
You really expect me to do that?

175
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:56,403
There are very few things

176
00:06:56,403 --> 00:06:59,249
that I will defend with true passion:

177
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:00,667
medical marijuana,

178
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:04,635
the biblical Satan as a metaphor
for rebellion against tyranny,

179
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:08,153
and mother fucking Goddamn cryptocurrency.

180
00:07:09,227 --> 00:07:10,160
Mmm.

181
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:13,429
I have a PowerPoint that I've been
wanting to show you for some time.

182
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:16,334
<i>Walk me through this.</i>

183
00:07:16,538 --> 00:07:18,068
We can't make our boxes in China

184
00:07:18,103 --> 00:07:19,236
because Yao has threatened

185
00:07:19,271 --> 00:07:20,938
every manufacturer in the country.

186
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:23,060
- That's right.
- We can't afford Bangladesh,

187
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:25,042
because the workers have unionized.

188
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:26,910
Sadly, correct.

189
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,612
And we can't use our place in Laos,

190
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:31,415
because one person gets
her scalp ripped off

191
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,189
and suddenly, everyone's
screaming regulations.

192
00:07:34,214 --> 00:07:35,152
Yes.

193
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,864
You know, you hear a lot of chatter

194
00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:38,635
about the growth of the global economy,

195
00:07:38,635 --> 00:07:40,534
but no one wants to
talk about the downside.

196
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:42,396
Gavin, there is one other

197
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:44,671
manufacturing option we
haven't discussed yet,

198
00:07:44,707 --> 00:07:47,073
which considering the
current circumstances,

199
00:07:47,108 --> 00:07:49,075
might be worth consideration.

200
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,188
I'm open to anything.

201
00:07:52,717 --> 00:07:53,716
America.

202
00:07:53,938 --> 00:07:55,052
Fuck you.

203
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,403
I feel the same way.

204
00:07:56,971 --> 00:07:58,538
But we were recently contacted

205
00:07:58,573 --> 00:08:00,807
by the mayor of Goldbriar, North Carolina.

206
00:08:00,842 --> 00:08:03,209
They had a DVR manufacturing
plant that closed.

207
00:08:03,244 --> 00:08:04,906
The retooling would be minimal.

208
00:08:05,046 --> 00:08:06,379
They've got a skilled labor pool

209
00:08:06,415 --> 00:08:08,964
just sitting idle and they sound desperate.

210
00:08:09,117 --> 00:08:10,101
Really?

211
00:08:10,886 --> 00:08:11,885
How desperate?

212
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,016
It was pitiful.

213
00:08:13,345 --> 00:08:14,359
Really?

214
00:08:15,423 --> 00:08:18,590
In 350 BCE,

215
00:08:18,626 --> 00:08:21,962
Aristotle defined sound money as being

216
00:08:21,962 --> 00:08:23,628
durable, transferable,

217
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:26,038
divisible, scarce, recognizable....

218
00:08:26,074 --> 00:08:27,519
- Gilfoyle?
- And fungible.

219
00:08:27,832 --> 00:08:28,774
What?

220
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:31,077
Can we skip ahead 2,400 years?

221
00:08:31,112 --> 00:08:33,239
I mean, I know what cryptocurrency is.

222
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:36,336
Richard, a lot of work
went into this presentation.

223
00:08:36,584 --> 00:08:38,013
- Okay.
- Fine.

224
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,737
But you're missing out
on a lot of wisdom, here.

225
00:08:45,126 --> 00:08:47,125
Why don't you tell me what you know

226
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,463
about Bitcoin as a jumping-off point?

227
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:50,611
Okay, sure.

228
00:08:50,612 --> 00:08:54,252
Uh, well, I'm pretty sure it
was founded by a Japanese guy...

229
00:08:54,346 --> 00:08:56,149
Or guys, or girls,

230
00:08:56,174 --> 00:08:59,152
going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008.

231
00:08:59,422 --> 00:09:00,755
True identity still unknown.

232
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,258
Okay, look, every day I read an article

233
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:05,593
about how we're in a Bitcoin bubble.

234
00:09:05,722 --> 00:09:07,557
And who is writing those articles?

235
00:09:08,121 --> 00:09:09,730
I don't wanna say the establishment.

236
00:09:09,766 --> 00:09:12,133
But is it possible that Warren Buffett

237
00:09:12,169 --> 00:09:14,669
called Bitcoin a pyramid scheme

238
00:09:14,704 --> 00:09:18,688
because he has 92 billion
conventional dollars to protect?

239
00:09:19,088 --> 00:09:21,978
Let's say he's right.
Let's say Bitcoin dies.

240
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,687
So what? MySpace,
Friendster, they both died.

241
00:09:25,114 --> 00:09:27,848
But they paved the way for
other social media tripe

242
00:09:27,883 --> 00:09:29,683
like Facebook and Twitter

243
00:09:29,718 --> 00:09:32,084
to completely overrun the planet.

244
00:09:33,256 --> 00:09:35,543
Crypto is out there.

245
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,325
And it's not going away.

246
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,593
It just feels sketchy.

247
00:09:40,067 --> 00:09:42,597
In the same way that a new Internet

248
00:09:42,988 --> 00:09:44,385
is sketchy, Richard?

249
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:46,637
- Well...
- What is crypto?

250
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:49,496
If not decentralized, anonymous, secure,

251
00:09:49,764 --> 00:09:52,477
and an existential threat
to the powers that be?

252
00:09:53,001 --> 00:09:55,235
I would think that you'd be
all-in on something like that.

253
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:58,804
Yeah. But do you really
think we can create a currency

254
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:00,306
worth $30 million?

255
00:10:00,341 --> 00:10:01,743
Because that's what we'd be giving up.

256
00:10:01,743 --> 00:10:04,056
Maybe. Probably even more.

257
00:10:04,579 --> 00:10:06,179
But even if it's less,

258
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:10,032
we would still gain control, autonomy,

259
00:10:10,032 --> 00:10:11,351
board seats and shares,

260
00:10:11,386 --> 00:10:15,066
and you wouldn't have to rely
on a VC who once fired you

261
00:10:15,623 --> 00:10:16,989
from your own company.

262
00:10:19,594 --> 00:10:20,860
So, there is a mode

263
00:10:20,895 --> 00:10:23,296
above Ludicrous Mode. Am I correct?

264
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:25,365
Yes. It's called Plaid.

265
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,001
And it comes standard on
the new Tesla Roadster.

266
00:10:28,036 --> 00:10:29,402
How do I get into one of these babies?

267
00:10:29,627 --> 00:10:33,072
Simple. You put down a
$50,000 deposit today.

268
00:10:33,361 --> 00:10:34,828
Okay.

269
00:10:34,863 --> 00:10:36,429
And you'll be behind the wheel

270
00:10:36,464 --> 00:10:37,964
as soon as they become available.

271
00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:40,138
And how quickly will that be, Stephanie?

272
00:10:40,138 --> 00:10:42,371
Soon. We're thinking a few years,

273
00:10:42,407 --> 00:10:43,856
which goes by fast.

274
00:10:44,042 --> 00:10:45,975
My daughter was a teenager in high school.

275
00:10:46,011 --> 00:10:48,077
- Next thing I knew...
- I'm gonna stop you right there.

276
00:10:48,112 --> 00:10:51,347
Your oily salesmanship is
starting to really irritate me.

277
00:10:51,537 --> 00:10:52,515
Okay?

278
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:55,051
I need to maintain my Tesla superiority,

279
00:10:55,086 --> 00:10:56,385
and I need to do it now.

280
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,756
Okay, I'm looking at a
new set of wheels here.

281
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,293
The 21-inch Arachnids.

282
00:11:00,425 --> 00:11:03,192
Very nice. But they're not for sale.

283
00:11:03,427 --> 00:11:06,061
You can only get them through
our referral awards program.

284
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,983
You refer three other customers to us,

285
00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:11,220
they buy a vehicle and,
zoop-zoop, you get the wheels.

286
00:11:11,455 --> 00:11:14,289
So, if I get more people to buy Teslas,

287
00:11:14,661 --> 00:11:17,708
then I will have the wheels
and no one else can get them?

288
00:11:18,299 --> 00:11:19,298
Not even Danny?

289
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:20,702
I'm sorry, who's Danny?

290
00:11:21,168 --> 00:11:23,135
He's the guy with the shitty wheels.

291
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:26,224
And now, the CEO of Hooli,

292
00:11:26,474 --> 00:11:28,173
Mr. Gavin Belson.

293
00:11:30,299 --> 00:11:32,299
_

294
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,331
Thank you, Mayor Wilkins.

295
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:37,540
Thank you, Goldbriar, for
this warm, wonderful welcome.

296
00:11:38,047 --> 00:11:39,913
You know, being in North Carolina

297
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,572
always feels like a bit
of a homecoming for me.

298
00:11:42,852 --> 00:11:46,052
I own a vacation property
just off the coast in Bermuda.

299
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:49,790
Technically, it is my
primary legal residence.

300
00:11:51,305 --> 00:11:52,337
_

301
00:11:52,362 --> 00:11:53,838
Good people of Goldbriar,

302
00:11:54,164 --> 00:11:56,430
for too long, foreign interests

303
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:59,076
have used unfair trade and labor practices

304
00:11:59,435 --> 00:12:02,703
to plunder American wealth
and steal American jobs.

305
00:12:03,003 --> 00:12:04,403
But I don't blame them for that.

306
00:12:04,439 --> 00:12:07,214
No. I blame weak, spineless

307
00:12:07,319 --> 00:12:08,901
American politicians.

308
00:12:09,476 --> 00:12:11,207
But if your mayor does his job,

309
00:12:11,207 --> 00:12:12,683
your jobs will come back,

310
00:12:12,683 --> 00:12:15,317
and soon, you will proudly be building

311
00:12:15,353 --> 00:12:18,170
the Gavin Belson Signature Box Three.

312
00:12:18,789 --> 00:12:20,856
But if for some reason

313
00:12:20,891 --> 00:12:24,198
he can't make my very
reasonable proposal work,

314
00:12:24,645 --> 00:12:25,944
you know who to blame.

315
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:28,563
I'm excited to get started.

316
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:31,250
What about y'all?

317
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:53,908
- Hi, Holden.
- Oh.

318
00:12:56,322 --> 00:12:58,683
Jared. Hi.

319
00:12:59,067 --> 00:13:00,166
Hi.

320
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,465
Can I ask you a question?

321
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,146
Of course.

322
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,970
Did you ask Richard to tell me

323
00:13:07,006 --> 00:13:09,842
that he liked the sandwich
that you made for him?

324
00:13:11,669 --> 00:13:12,702
No.

325
00:13:17,182 --> 00:13:18,414
Is that the truth?

326
00:13:19,384 --> 00:13:20,450
Yes.

327
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:25,669
Okay.

328
00:13:27,632 --> 00:13:28,731
Okay.

329
00:13:30,862 --> 00:13:32,235
Good job with that plate.

330
00:13:33,965 --> 00:13:35,026
Thanks.

331
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:47,572
Now, I can see the looks on your faces.

332
00:13:47,745 --> 00:13:49,091
I know what you're thinking.

333
00:13:49,347 --> 00:13:52,847
Why does Dinesh care so
much if I buy a Tesla?

334
00:13:53,158 --> 00:13:54,383
I'll tell you why.

335
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:57,085
Because Teslas are good for the world.

336
00:13:57,364 --> 00:13:59,655
Surprisingly pedestrian
wheels, but you get over that.

337
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,178
So, come on.

338
00:14:01,178 --> 00:14:03,306
Series B, right? Cha-ching.

339
00:14:03,331 --> 00:14:05,564
I was gonna use that to
pay off my student loans.

340
00:14:05,589 --> 00:14:06,537
That's boring.

341
00:14:06,573 --> 00:14:08,306
And don't take this the wrong way,

342
00:14:08,341 --> 00:14:10,441
but it seems like it's very important

343
00:14:10,477 --> 00:14:12,283
for you to be the Tesla guy in the office.

344
00:14:13,179 --> 00:14:14,548
Like, weirdly important.

345
00:14:14,695 --> 00:14:17,448
I'm not weird, you're weird.
You guys are being so weird.

346
00:14:17,484 --> 00:14:20,740
Come on. What's it gonna take
to get you into a Tesla today?

347
00:14:21,349 --> 00:14:24,122
Here. I've printed out hundreds of these.

348
00:14:24,122 --> 00:14:26,522
There you go. There you go, pass these on.

349
00:14:26,558 --> 00:14:27,753
Dave? Dave?

350
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,594
All right, what's this interesting idea?

351
00:14:31,629 --> 00:14:33,229
Gilfoyle and I were talking.

352
00:14:33,264 --> 00:14:36,941
And this may seem a little
out there at first, but...

353
00:14:37,302 --> 00:14:40,668
Instead of funding our
launch with a series B,

354
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:42,508
what about...

355
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:44,574
an ICO?

356
00:14:46,664 --> 00:14:48,944
An initial coin offering?
It's basically a...

357
00:14:48,979 --> 00:14:50,913
Are you a fucking moron?

358
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,650
Maybe I don't need to be here for this.

359
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:56,018
Sit the fuck down.

360
00:14:56,053 --> 00:14:57,054
Okay.

361
00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:00,188
Richard, what are you doing?

362
00:15:00,224 --> 00:15:02,123
Just exploring our options.

363
00:15:02,158 --> 00:15:04,249
Why? You don't think I have your back?

364
00:15:04,394 --> 00:15:06,261
Look, I get that you're giving up

365
00:15:06,296 --> 00:15:07,462
board seats and shares,

366
00:15:07,497 --> 00:15:09,397
but look what you're getting in return.

367
00:15:09,433 --> 00:15:12,567
As if the $30 million you were
getting wasn't good enough,

368
00:15:12,603 --> 00:15:15,069
we provide you with marketing,
networking, staffing.

369
00:15:15,105 --> 00:15:17,004
We help you negotiate partnerships

370
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,280
and navigate regulations.

371
00:15:18,305 --> 00:15:21,176
All these things that are
changing by the minute.

372
00:15:21,361 --> 00:15:23,446
Gilfoyle, can you help with any of that?

373
00:15:24,147 --> 00:15:26,981
I'd rather just listen if
it's all the same to you.

374
00:15:27,016 --> 00:15:29,217
Look, if you do an ICO,

375
00:15:29,253 --> 00:15:30,752
you're not only saying fuck you to us,

376
00:15:30,787 --> 00:15:32,220
you're saying fuck you to all VCs.

377
00:15:32,256 --> 00:15:33,654
Jesus, Richard. Why would you even

378
00:15:33,689 --> 00:15:36,057
think it would be okay
to talk to me about this?

379
00:15:36,092 --> 00:15:38,425
Like would you ask your wife
who you should cheat with?

380
00:15:38,461 --> 00:15:39,469
No.

381
00:15:40,114 --> 00:15:41,151
Well, maybe.

382
00:15:41,186 --> 00:15:42,185
I don't know, I...

383
00:15:42,781 --> 00:15:45,177
I guess I was just looking
for advice from a friend.

384
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,324
Oh, are we friends, Richard?

385
00:15:47,359 --> 00:15:48,858
- Yes, of course.
- Really?

386
00:15:48,893 --> 00:15:50,493
Have we spoken once in the past year

387
00:15:50,528 --> 00:15:52,594
about anything other than business?

388
00:15:52,594 --> 00:15:53,649
Yes.

389
00:15:54,297 --> 00:15:56,489
Wait. No.

390
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,123
- When's my birthday?
- Come on.

391
00:15:58,158 --> 00:16:00,250
Do I live in a house or an apartment?

392
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,347
Did you even know that I was married?

393
00:16:03,382 --> 00:16:05,142
- You are?
- I was, I...

394
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,283
had it annulled after three months.

395
00:16:07,318 --> 00:16:09,326
Did he ask you who he should cheat with?

396
00:16:12,424 --> 00:16:14,639
Look, you came for advice, fine.

397
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,459
Forget an ICO.

398
00:16:16,495 --> 00:16:17,560
Okay? I'm sure Gilfoyle

399
00:16:17,596 --> 00:16:20,129
told you that he can handle
all the technical stuff.

400
00:16:20,345 --> 00:16:22,379
But this is not just a math problem.

401
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:25,563
They're my direct competition.
I've done my homework on this.

402
00:16:26,372 --> 00:16:28,239
So before you walk away from stability

403
00:16:28,275 --> 00:16:31,026
and gamble your entire company on crypto,

404
00:16:31,245 --> 00:16:32,944
there's another "friend" of yours

405
00:16:32,979 --> 00:16:34,315
I think you should talk to.

406
00:16:35,773 --> 00:16:38,672
I was such a fucking pussy
when Bitcoin broke, Richard.

407
00:16:39,116 --> 00:16:40,219
If I had the balls,

408
00:16:40,254 --> 00:16:42,353
I'd have put every penny
I had into that shit

409
00:16:42,388 --> 00:16:43,354
five years ago,

410
00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:44,787
watched it go up, up, up, up, up

411
00:16:44,812 --> 00:16:47,287
and then pulled out right before
it all came crashing down again.

412
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:49,132
I mean, Jesus, why didn't I do that?

413
00:16:49,132 --> 00:16:51,000
Fuck me! But then, it occurred to me...

414
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,115
I own 36 fucking companies, Richard.

415
00:16:54,794 --> 00:16:56,720
If I make them all ICO,

416
00:16:56,838 --> 00:16:59,037
that's 36 bites at the apple.

417
00:16:59,474 --> 00:17:00,540
So I did it.

418
00:17:00,575 --> 00:17:03,076
- You... you did 36 ICOs?
- Yup.

419
00:17:03,368 --> 00:17:05,012
- Did they work?
- You know, one of the things

420
00:17:05,047 --> 00:17:07,281
being in the three comma
club has taught me, Richard,

421
00:17:07,316 --> 00:17:08,548
is it's not always about money.

422
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:10,284
Sometimes, it's about wisdom.

423
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,501
And did I lose a B? Close to it. Fuck!

424
00:17:14,023 --> 00:17:16,609
But I bet I gained two B in wisdom.

425
00:17:17,105 --> 00:17:18,525
So you lost it all?

426
00:17:19,795 --> 00:17:22,796
Ha, ha, Richard, if I didn't
love this crazy guy so much,

427
00:17:22,831 --> 00:17:24,254
I'd knock his fucking teeth out.

428
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,113
Nah, nah, I didn't lose it all.

429
00:17:26,602 --> 00:17:28,371
I mean, one of them got
shut down by the SEC.

430
00:17:28,372 --> 00:17:29,940
On a few, we got scammed.

431
00:17:30,173 --> 00:17:31,506
But some of them worked.

432
00:17:32,909 --> 00:17:33,975
One of them worked.

433
00:17:34,202 --> 00:17:36,617
One? One out of 36?

434
00:17:36,913 --> 00:17:37,979
Yeah. Listen,

435
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,508
all the coin I had from the ICO that worked

436
00:17:40,543 --> 00:17:42,009
was on a USB thumb drive.

437
00:17:42,355 --> 00:17:43,855
And my dumb fucking housekeeper

438
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,346
threw out my jeans,
'cause they were ripped.

439
00:17:45,371 --> 00:17:46,871
Even though I paid more
for the ripped ones.

440
00:17:46,896 --> 00:17:48,515
And the thumb drive was in the pocket, so.

441
00:17:48,515 --> 00:17:51,180
$300 million in crypto is
buried out here, somewhere.

442
00:17:51,265 --> 00:17:52,765
But my boys will find it.

443
00:17:52,802 --> 00:17:54,385
If they wanna get paid, right?

444
00:17:55,604 --> 00:17:56,806
And when they do,

445
00:17:56,972 --> 00:17:58,772
that coin could cover all the losers.

446
00:17:58,808 --> 00:18:01,174
I mean, it's up 3,000%
in the last two weeks.

447
00:18:01,209 --> 00:18:03,444
If it keeps going like this
over the next three, four months,

448
00:18:03,479 --> 00:18:05,278
we could be talking the four comma club!

449
00:18:05,314 --> 00:18:06,947
That's a T, not a B, Richard.

450
00:18:07,314 --> 00:18:09,483
- Mr. Hanneman!
- Shit, you found it?

451
00:18:09,518 --> 00:18:12,806
Jose! Yes! No!

452
00:18:13,522 --> 00:18:15,055
I said a thumb drive.

453
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,790
In the... that's an actual thumb.

454
00:18:17,024 --> 00:18:19,345
That's a human... Just
fucking put that back!

455
00:18:19,888 --> 00:18:21,976
Again, Richard...

456
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,232
the math is sound.

457
00:18:30,006 --> 00:18:32,606
Well, Mayor, I sure have
enjoyed our time together.

458
00:18:32,641 --> 00:18:33,930
Let me know when you get this done.

459
00:18:33,955 --> 00:18:36,911
Uh, Mr. Belson, I'm sorry,
but this list of demands

460
00:18:36,946 --> 00:18:39,746
is not remotely workable
for a community of our size.

461
00:18:40,089 --> 00:18:42,116
A mayor's job is never easy.

462
00:18:42,151 --> 00:18:43,417
But you'll find a way,

463
00:18:43,452 --> 00:18:44,985
if you care about your constituents.

464
00:18:45,021 --> 00:18:46,987
Mr. Belson, I grew up in this town.

465
00:18:47,023 --> 00:18:48,422
I've lived here my entire life.

466
00:18:48,457 --> 00:18:50,457
- I'd do anything to...
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

467
00:18:50,492 --> 00:18:52,426
- Your entire life?
- Mm-hmm.

468
00:18:52,461 --> 00:18:54,519
- How old are you?
- Forty-seven.

469
00:18:55,264 --> 00:18:56,797
That's a little weird, isn't it?

470
00:18:56,832 --> 00:19:00,433
The point is, I'd do anything
to help the people of this area.

471
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:03,997
But giving you public money on this
scale would decimate our budget.

472
00:19:04,572 --> 00:19:07,040
I could have the local high
school renamed after you.

473
00:19:07,075 --> 00:19:09,442
Rosa Parks has never
even been to Goldbriar.

474
00:19:09,477 --> 00:19:10,977
I don't want a fucking high school.

475
00:19:11,012 --> 00:19:14,180
I wanna manufacture boxes
at an 80% profit margin.

476
00:19:14,215 --> 00:19:15,315
I don't understand.

477
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,193
All my asshole friends keep getting

478
00:19:17,218 --> 00:19:19,352
NFL stadiums and corporate headquarters,

479
00:19:19,387 --> 00:19:20,719
all fully paid for.

480
00:19:20,755 --> 00:19:24,077
And you can't make one
fucking factory happen?

481
00:19:24,195 --> 00:19:27,060
I mean, the only things I have
left to cut are essential services.

482
00:19:27,095 --> 00:19:28,894
There you go. Do that.

483
00:19:29,055 --> 00:19:30,866
You could have a volunteer fire department.

484
00:19:30,957 --> 00:19:33,132
Because I can't afford
a penny more than this.

485
00:19:36,536 --> 00:19:38,003
Everybody ready?

486
00:19:39,406 --> 00:19:40,572

Yeah, it's nice.

498
00:20:08,969 --> 00:20:11,268
Sorry we couldn't find a
safe spot to try Insane Mode.

499
00:20:11,304 --> 00:20:13,104
It feels like your kidneys
are gonna get, like,

500
00:20:13,139 --> 00:20:14,606
ripped right through the back of your body.

501
00:20:14,641 --> 00:20:16,975
- It's like...
- Yeah, I don't think I'd wanna do that.

502
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:18,409
Well you don't need to do it.

503
00:20:18,444 --> 00:20:21,245
But you wanna be able to tell
people that you can do it.

504
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,220
Right? It's like having a gun.

505
00:20:23,783 --> 00:20:26,618
So, Charlie and Nadia
have already said yes.

506
00:20:26,653 --> 00:20:29,066
You'll finally have something
to talk to them about.

507
00:20:29,288 --> 00:20:31,022
Oh, let me think about it.

508
00:20:31,057 --> 00:20:33,659
Fine. Okay, just pull
into the designated EV...

509
00:20:33,684 --> 00:20:34,670
...2.8 seconds.

510
00:20:34,695 --> 00:20:35,994
Oh, fuck.

511
00:20:36,029 --> 00:20:37,361
Danny already got his car.

512
00:20:37,687 --> 00:20:40,064
I'll pay your down payment and first
three months. Do we have a deal?

513
00:20:40,161 --> 00:20:41,311
Wow, really?

514
00:20:42,768 --> 00:20:43,934
Make it six months.

515
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:46,208
Fine! Okay, just go.

516
00:20:46,233 --> 00:20:48,301
Hide before Danny sees
us in this shitty car.

517
00:20:48,336 --> 00:20:49,769
- Go, go, go. Go.
- Wow, uh...

518
00:20:53,521 --> 00:20:54,469
Hello?

519
00:20:54,688 --> 00:20:56,221
Hey, guess what?

520
00:20:56,257 --> 00:20:58,305
My boss just bought me a car!

521
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:01,909
What? No! Ew. Ugh!

522
00:21:04,493 --> 00:21:07,160
Richard? Ron LaFlamme's office just called.

523
00:21:07,195 --> 00:21:10,029
And the series B paperwork
is ready for you to sign.

524
00:21:11,337 --> 00:21:12,369
Okay.

525
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:16,150
Uh, well, then I guess I'll
just go over there and sign it.

526
00:21:16,327 --> 00:21:19,028
Richard, I know you were
pinning your hopes on the ICO,

527
00:21:19,064 --> 00:21:21,630
but I... I think series
B is the right call.

528
00:21:21,756 --> 00:21:23,689
Yeah, no, I... I hope so.

529
00:21:23,892 --> 00:21:25,825
We're gonna get the
money we need to launch,

530
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,360
and everyone out there is
gonna get a great bonus.

531
00:21:28,396 --> 00:21:31,297
And then, you're gonna
have an army of happy

532
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:33,148
and highly motivated workers...

533
00:21:34,447 --> 00:21:35,446
Jared?

534
00:21:35,474 --> 00:21:36,994
Everything okay with Holden?

535
00:21:37,273 --> 00:21:38,899
You mean, like, mentally?

536
00:21:38,924 --> 00:21:40,532
I was wondering that, too.

537
00:21:40,605 --> 00:21:42,721
No. No, no. Just, like...

538
00:21:42,721 --> 00:21:44,291
like, with you and him.

539
00:21:44,507 --> 00:21:46,942
Just seems like you're
being really hard on him.

540
00:21:47,409 --> 00:21:48,591
Do you like him?

541
00:21:49,004 --> 00:21:50,443
Yeah. I mean, sure.

542
00:21:51,137 --> 00:21:53,301
Okay. It's okay if you like him.

543
00:21:53,582 --> 00:21:55,171
That's all that matters, right?

544
00:21:55,384 --> 00:21:56,316
Yeah.

545
00:21:56,351 --> 00:21:58,479
Okay. Well, I'll see you when, uh...

546
00:21:58,721 --> 00:22:00,661
I'll see you when you
get back from LaFlamme's.

547
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,101
Every institutional investor
to whom I reached out

548
00:22:14,136 --> 00:22:15,936
agreed to participate in our second fund.

549
00:22:15,971 --> 00:22:19,825
The capital issues we
faced due to Eklow's failure

550
00:22:19,928 --> 00:22:21,140
have been remedied.

551
00:22:21,438 --> 00:22:23,276
Laurie, you are a badass.

552
00:22:25,379 --> 00:22:27,413
Ah, yes. A compliment.

553
00:22:27,796 --> 00:22:30,889
Well, I think the numbers
in our new prospectus

554
00:22:30,889 --> 00:22:32,421
speak for themselves.

555
00:22:34,893 --> 00:22:37,927
Sorry, you're projecting
that 70% of Pied Piper's

556
00:22:37,963 --> 00:22:40,955
operating income is gonna
come from ad sales, but...

557
00:22:41,395 --> 00:22:42,895
Pied Piper's not gonna sell ads.

558
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:45,998
Yes. I understand that
is their current position.

559
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:48,567
No, Laurie, when we
offered them their series B,

560
00:22:48,602 --> 00:22:51,070
I promised Richard that
we would never make them

561
00:22:51,105 --> 00:22:52,404
harvest data or sell ads.

562
00:22:52,439 --> 00:22:55,506
However, that language is
not part of their term sheet.

563
00:22:56,057 --> 00:22:59,356
I am not saying that we will
force their hand on this issue.

564
00:22:59,612 --> 00:23:03,545
But neither am I saying
definitively that we will not.

565
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:08,256
Okay, but you and I,
we are partners, right?

566
00:23:08,256 --> 00:23:09,322
Of course.

567
00:23:09,357 --> 00:23:12,354
Any decision we make, we
will certainly make together.

568
00:23:12,655 --> 00:23:14,426
Good. As long as that's clear.

569
00:23:14,897 --> 00:23:17,330
And again, great job closing our funding.

570
00:23:17,365 --> 00:23:20,266
Ah, yes. Huzzah. Onward.

571
00:23:27,109 --> 00:23:28,257
Laurie, did you have

572
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:30,143
the big, hairy question
put back on my wall?

573
00:23:30,178 --> 00:23:31,544
Yes. I like it there.

574
00:23:31,814 --> 00:23:32,869
But I don't.

575
00:23:33,715 --> 00:23:34,780
And yet...

576
00:23:39,654 --> 00:23:42,021
All right. One more, right there.

577
00:23:42,056 --> 00:23:44,890
And done-zo.

578
00:23:44,926 --> 00:23:46,726
Series Ba-bam.

579
00:23:46,761 --> 00:23:48,294
Richard, don't sign it.

580
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:49,707
Look, I can't protect you.

581
00:23:49,876 --> 00:23:51,465
At some point, Laurie's gonna fuck you over

582
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,928
- and make you sell ads.
- What?

583
00:23:52,953 --> 00:23:54,820
And I don't think there's
anything I can do about it.

584
00:23:54,856 --> 00:23:57,661
Don't sign the deal. I just did. It's done.

585
00:23:57,661 --> 00:23:58,960
Jesus Christ.

586
00:23:58,995 --> 00:24:00,362
Laurie's gonna sell ads.

587
00:24:00,456 --> 00:24:02,038
Isn't that what I told you?

588
00:24:02,063 --> 00:24:04,063
What the fuck am I supposed to do now?

589
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:05,643
God!

590
00:24:06,297 --> 00:24:08,291
You know I can just tear these up, right?

591
00:24:11,997 --> 00:24:13,764
No, I know. Good.

592
00:24:15,568 --> 00:24:16,800
- I like it.
- _

593
00:24:16,835 --> 00:24:18,736
But can we adjust the proportions?

594
00:24:18,771 --> 00:24:20,636
Make the logo bigger?

595
00:24:20,737 --> 00:24:22,640
And... and make the flag bigger?

596
00:24:22,675 --> 00:24:24,708
And... and make the box bigger, too.

597
00:24:24,744 --> 00:24:27,210
It all just needs to be bigger.

598
00:24:27,246 --> 00:24:28,363
Okay.

599
00:24:28,681 --> 00:24:29,991
- Bigger.
- Yeah.

600
00:24:30,316 --> 00:24:32,229
- Sir.
- Ah, Hoover.

601
00:24:32,933 --> 00:24:34,285
How's the factory coming?

602
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,585
We almost online?

603
00:24:36,061 --> 00:24:37,473
Not exactly, sir.

604
00:24:38,169 --> 00:24:39,201
It's gone.

605
00:24:39,237 --> 00:24:40,242
What do you mean?

606
00:24:40,481 --> 00:24:42,515
Did that dipshit mayor renege on our deal?

607
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:44,030
No, he made every effort,

608
00:24:44,185 --> 00:24:46,152
including having the factory repainted.

609
00:24:46,331 --> 00:24:47,964
Okay. So what's the problem?

610
00:24:47,999 --> 00:24:51,535
Well, apparently, the painters left
some oily rags in a garbage can.

611
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,497
Mm-hmm.

612
00:24:52,522 --> 00:24:54,902
But because of cuts to
the sanitation service,

613
00:24:55,154 --> 00:24:56,553
the trash was not collected

614
00:24:56,588 --> 00:24:58,548
and the rags smoldered and caught fire.

615
00:24:58,779 --> 00:25:00,757
And because of cuts to the fire department,

616
00:25:00,793 --> 00:25:01,859
the blaze spread.

617
00:25:02,526 --> 00:25:03,861
A number of concerned citizens

618
00:25:03,896 --> 00:25:05,329
volunteered to help fight the fire,

619
00:25:05,364 --> 00:25:08,265
but because the water was
cut off, they could not.

620
00:25:08,301 --> 00:25:09,465
Okay, so what happened?

621
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,435
Well, the vast majority of our
expensive, rare earth materials

622
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,436
survived the fire.

623
00:25:13,471 --> 00:25:14,901
Well, that's something.

624
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:16,539
Until the flames abated,

625
00:25:16,574 --> 00:25:18,741
when because of mass layoffs of police,

626
00:25:18,776 --> 00:25:20,761
the locals that were
there to fight the fire

627
00:25:21,012 --> 00:25:24,180
decided instead to loot
the burned-out factory.

628
00:25:24,822 --> 00:25:26,948
The National Guard attempted
to reach the factory

629
00:25:26,948 --> 00:25:28,320
to help stop this, but...

630
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,563
- The roads.
- The roads, sir, yes.

631
00:25:30,563 --> 00:25:31,587
Okay.

632
00:25:31,786 --> 00:25:33,291
So, we lost it all?

633
00:25:33,788 --> 00:25:35,354
- Everything?
- Yes.

634
00:25:36,657 --> 00:25:38,148
Also, the IRS called.

635
00:25:38,326 --> 00:25:40,526
Somehow, they found out about Bermuda.

636
00:25:46,137 --> 00:25:48,270
Look, when you take it all into account,

637
00:25:48,306 --> 00:25:49,906
turning down our series B

638
00:25:49,941 --> 00:25:51,574
and doing an ICO to fund your launch,

639
00:25:51,609 --> 00:25:53,437
may actually give you the best odds.

640
00:25:53,781 --> 00:25:55,614
You said ICOs are suicide.

641
00:25:55,639 --> 00:25:56,856
Well, I'm a VC

642
00:25:56,881 --> 00:25:59,164
and some of that might have
been self-preservational.

643
00:25:59,317 --> 00:26:00,346
Okay.

644
00:26:00,371 --> 00:26:03,018
Well, even if you were
exaggerating, you're still right.

645
00:26:03,054 --> 00:26:06,589
I mean, Russ Hanneman had 36
chances to make an ICO work

646
00:26:06,614 --> 00:26:07,847
and he basically failed.

647
00:26:07,867 --> 00:26:08,942
I only have one.

648
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:11,435
Look, Gilfoyle can handle
all the technical stuff.

649
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,792
You just need to hire someone

650
00:26:12,828 --> 00:26:14,081
who can handle the business side.

651
00:26:14,234 --> 00:26:15,762
- Like who?
- I don't know.

652
00:26:15,797 --> 00:26:18,530
I'm sorry, but I gotta
Uber back to the office

653
00:26:18,566 --> 00:26:19,965
before Laurie realizes I'm gone.

654
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,633
No, no, wait. Who do I hire?

655
00:26:21,669 --> 00:26:23,836
Someone who understands securities, right?

656
00:26:23,871 --> 00:26:24,837
Not necessarily.

657
00:26:24,872 --> 00:26:26,672
I mean, your coin doesn't
have to be a security.

658
00:26:26,707 --> 00:26:28,674
You could do a utility token instead,

659
00:26:28,709 --> 00:26:30,509
since you provide an
actual unit of compute.

660
00:26:30,544 --> 00:26:32,878
Although, you'd have to convince the SEC.

661
00:26:33,881 --> 00:26:35,331
Damn it. Surge pricing.

662
00:26:35,583 --> 00:26:37,483
- Monica.
- You might not even need to bother

663
00:26:37,518 --> 00:26:39,651
with a moving average pricing
strategy when you launch.

664
00:26:39,687 --> 00:26:41,387
But you will need to keep a close eye on

665
00:26:41,422 --> 00:26:42,954
statements from the federal government,

666
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:43,989
South Korea, and China.

667
00:26:44,024 --> 00:26:45,591
So, whoever you do hire

668
00:26:45,626 --> 00:26:47,225
should definitely know how to do all that.

669
00:26:47,261 --> 00:26:48,414
Okay, six minutes.

670
00:26:48,584 --> 00:26:49,971
- Monica.
- What?

671
00:26:50,498 --> 00:26:51,692
It's you.

672
00:26:51,866 --> 00:26:53,098
You're the right person.

673
00:26:53,648 --> 00:26:54,808
No.

674
00:26:55,035 --> 00:26:56,368
No. No, no, no, no, no.

675
00:26:56,403 --> 00:26:58,036
Come on. Give me one good reason.

676
00:26:59,072 --> 00:27:01,539
I... love my job.

677
00:27:01,574 --> 00:27:02,735
You hate working for Laurie.

678
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,911
With Laurie, okay? We
are both equal partners.

679
00:27:05,946 --> 00:27:06,937
Okay.

680
00:27:07,276 --> 00:27:10,134
Look, Monica. I will do the ICO.

681
00:27:10,483 --> 00:27:12,203
But only if you do it with me.

682
00:27:15,593 --> 00:27:16,625
Come on.

683
00:27:17,742 --> 00:27:18,908
Wait, what's happening?

684
00:27:19,931 --> 00:27:21,297
Canceling my Uber.

685
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:24,981
- So, you're in?
- Fuck it.

686
00:27:25,017 --> 00:27:26,149
I'm in.

687
00:27:26,424 --> 00:27:27,456
Fuck series B.

688
00:27:27,491 --> 00:27:29,325
PiedPiperCoin is totally gonna work.

689
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,793
Yes. It is. It totally is.

690
00:27:37,201 --> 00:27:38,467
So, just to confirm,

691
00:27:38,856 --> 00:27:40,436
in order for this coin to be worth

692
00:27:40,436 --> 00:27:42,202
what series B was worth to all of us,

693
00:27:42,238 --> 00:27:44,004
it has to sell for how much?

694
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:45,905
$68.

695
00:27:46,126 --> 00:27:47,107
I see.

696
00:27:47,258 --> 00:27:50,322
And seven cents is less than that.

697
00:27:50,846 --> 00:27:51,890
Yup.

698
00:27:51,981 --> 00:27:53,756
Whose idea was this again?

699
00:27:53,916 --> 00:27:57,151
I believe the initial idea was Gilfoyle's.

700
00:27:57,186 --> 00:27:58,885
To be fair, it was Monica

701
00:27:58,921 --> 00:28:01,454
who really pushed it over the goal line.

702
00:28:01,768 --> 00:28:04,385
Well, I'm gonna head
down to the Tesla dealer

703
00:28:04,385 --> 00:28:06,296
and beg them to take my car back.

704
00:28:07,488 --> 00:28:09,224
Well, that's something.

705
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:11,323
And my two referrals fell through.

706
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:12,758
And I had to return mine.

707
00:28:12,793 --> 00:28:15,461
So now the only Tesla in
the office is Priyanka's

708
00:28:15,496 --> 00:28:16,799
and I'm paying for that.

709
00:28:16,824 --> 00:28:18,423
So, that's cool.

710
00:28:18,699 --> 00:28:21,229
Richard, adversity is a great teacher.

711
00:28:21,436 --> 00:28:23,292
Just like cigarette burns.

712
00:28:31,195 --> 00:28:32,834
Laurie, hi.

713
00:28:33,247 --> 00:28:34,213
Monica.

714
00:28:34,248 --> 00:28:36,979
Congratulations on the ICO.

715
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:41,064
Yeah, yeah. Not quite the
numbers we were hoping for.

716
00:28:41,621 --> 00:28:43,188
I'm sure you're happy about that.

717
00:28:43,223 --> 00:28:44,252
On the contrary.

718
00:28:44,252 --> 00:28:46,224
Monica, you have certain values.

719
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:49,040
And I see no reason you should not
work with companies that share them.

720
00:28:49,369 --> 00:28:52,569
Similarly, I should work with
companies that share my values.

721
00:28:53,291 --> 00:28:54,765
So, no hard feelings?

722
00:28:55,182 --> 00:28:57,466
No feelings at all, Monica.

723
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:58,736
We are friends

724
00:28:58,771 --> 00:29:01,473
and we should not let business
get in the way of that.

725
00:29:01,731 --> 00:29:04,440
Speaking of, I am stepping into a meeting.

726
00:29:04,711 --> 00:29:07,268
Right, well, I'm surprised
you're taking this so well,

727
00:29:07,268 --> 00:29:09,113
I really appreciate it, Laurie.

728
00:29:09,148 --> 00:29:10,447
Let us talk soon.

729
00:29:19,825 --> 00:29:21,191
Have you received my proposal?

730
00:29:21,227 --> 00:29:22,974
Very promising.

731
