1
00:00:01,768 --> 00:00:04,497
I give you the product
that will carry Hooli

2
00:00:04,565 --> 00:00:07,318
to complete market dominance.

3
00:00:09,591 --> 00:00:13,145
- It looks like a penis.
- Yes... Yes, it does.

4
00:00:13,686 --> 00:00:15,810
So, we're giving
a random company

5
00:00:15,942 --> 00:00:17,977
a bunch of free
compute power in our network?

6
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:19,989
- The AI company?
- I made her!

7
00:00:20,067 --> 00:00:22,677
I can do anything
I want with her!

8
00:00:22,852 --> 00:00:24,731
Ugh. Gross.

9
00:00:24,936 --> 00:00:27,977
Can you please tell me
what you are going to do

10
00:00:28,052 --> 00:00:30,356
about this
Jian Yang situation?

11
00:00:30,487 --> 00:00:31,794
Yes. Nothing.

12
00:00:32,027 --> 00:00:36,410
"I went to China to do
new new internet. Jian Yang."

13
00:00:45,787 --> 00:00:47,369
This went up yesterday.

14
00:00:47,519 --> 00:00:50,106
A fake Pied Piper.
This is Jian-Yang, not us.

15
00:00:50,228 --> 00:00:51,943
Richard, he has a website.

16
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,396
Okay? He doesn't
have a product.

17
00:00:53,473 --> 00:00:54,791
Just post a cease
and desist

18
00:00:54,859 --> 00:00:55,916
on your own website

19
00:00:55,984 --> 00:00:57,947
- and move on.
- We need action.

20
00:00:58,228 --> 00:01:01,022
I wanna move up our launch so we
can beat this asshole to market.

21
00:01:01,099 --> 00:01:05,303
We need money. So, how quickly
can we get a series B together?

22
00:01:05,421 --> 00:01:08,478
Richard, a series B
is not a done deal.

23
00:01:08,546 --> 00:01:10,307
And Laurie's not gonna be
able to weigh in on this

24
00:01:10,356 --> 00:01:12,192
until she's done sorting
things out over at Eklow.

25
00:01:12,259 --> 00:01:13,379
Why is she still over there?

26
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,655
We put 112 million
of our dollars into a company

27
00:01:16,723 --> 00:01:20,343
whose creepy CEO just fled
with its most valuable asset.

28
00:01:20,499 --> 00:01:23,116
Ariel and that robot
could be anywhere.

29
00:01:23,225 --> 00:01:24,866
Ariel fucked us too, remember?

30
00:01:25,014 --> 00:01:27,806
I just had my whole company
on a three-day code sprint

31
00:01:27,874 --> 00:01:28,884
to repair all the holes

32
00:01:28,952 --> 00:01:30,407
and un-fuck all
the damage he did.

33
00:01:30,475 --> 00:01:32,469
Besides,
Laurie doesn't work at Eklow.

34
00:01:32,546 --> 00:01:34,302
She works here,
with you and me.

35
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:35,561
True,

36
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,655
but also not true.

37
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:41,937
Look, Laurie has installed
herself as Eklow's interim CEO.

38
00:01:42,264 --> 00:01:43,460
What?

39
00:01:43,593 --> 00:01:45,696
Laurie, Ariel encrypted
all of his files.

40
00:01:45,764 --> 00:01:46,837
We can't open
any of them.

41
00:01:46,905 --> 00:01:48,724
Ah, understood.
Keep trying, please.

42
00:01:48,801 --> 00:01:49,821
I spoke with the bank.

43
00:01:49,889 --> 00:01:51,686
We're not gonna
make payroll.

44
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:55,030
Noted. Thank you for your diligence.
People are pretty upset.

45
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:56,655
Somebody shattered
the toilet.

46
00:01:56,723 --> 00:01:58,186
Ah, yes, well,
we'll certainly

47
00:01:58,254 --> 00:02:00,108
have to get that
repaired, won't we?

48
00:02:01,157 --> 00:02:02,826
Good work, you two.

49
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,632
Hang in there.

50
00:02:09,844 --> 00:02:11,233
Hey, Laurie.

51
00:02:11,301 --> 00:02:13,356
I know you're "busy"
being a "CEO,"

52
00:02:13,465 --> 00:02:15,926
but we have to have
a serious conversation about...

53
00:02:21,109 --> 00:02:22,793
- Richard?
- Yes?

54
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:26,035
I have vomited
into my shirt.

55

58
00:02:38,631 --> 00:02:39,846
Puking.

59
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:41,348
That's my move.

60
00:02:41,546 --> 00:02:43,301
Thank you for...

61
00:02:45,863 --> 00:02:47,619
finding me a...

62
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:49,016
a change of clothing.

63
00:02:49,183 --> 00:02:51,844
Well, fortunately, you're
the same size as the robot.

64
00:02:52,035 --> 00:02:54,691
Richard,
the position of CEO is...

65
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,182
taxing.

66
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,043
It isn't easy, is it?

67
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,316
I think perhaps I may have

68
00:03:00,957 --> 00:03:03,551
treated you unfairly
in the past.

69
00:03:03,921 --> 00:03:05,207
Oh..

70
00:03:06,824 --> 00:03:07,911
Well...

71
00:03:08,004 --> 00:03:10,844
I mean, a couple... a couple... yeah.
Sure. Thank you.

72
00:03:11,121 --> 00:03:12,715
Thank you for
saying that, yeah.

73
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:13,988
Yes.

74
00:03:16,467 --> 00:03:18,738
Well, I have work to do,
as do you, so.

75
00:03:31,448 --> 00:03:35,730
You know, Laurie, I actually
may have a way to help you here.

76
00:03:36,977 --> 00:03:39,543
Things are changing
in China now, Gavin.

77
00:03:39,808 --> 00:03:41,410
There are many reforms.

78
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,599
As you see,
we provide a series

79
00:03:43,676 --> 00:03:45,599
of Tai Chi
and movement classes,

80
00:03:45,676 --> 00:03:47,426
free for all employees,

81
00:03:47,543 --> 00:03:49,863
as well as free
medical benefits.

82
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,090
Ah, our nutrition center.

83
00:03:53,285 --> 00:03:55,160
In addition
to all the good food

84
00:03:55,246 --> 00:03:57,613
we serve
in our main cafeteria.

85
00:03:57,926 --> 00:03:59,558
Also free of charge.

86
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:02,174
This concludes our tour.

87
00:04:02,337 --> 00:04:03,552
Any questions?

88
00:04:03,754 --> 00:04:05,043
Just one.

89
00:04:05,342 --> 00:04:06,832
What the fuck?

90
00:04:06,988 --> 00:04:08,983
Sorry? If I wanted
to see nap pods

91
00:04:09,051 --> 00:04:10,967
and climbing walls,
I would've stayed home,

92
00:04:11,035 --> 00:04:12,295
or gone to fucking Denmark.

93
00:04:12,363 --> 00:04:13,715
All I wanna see
is people working

94
00:04:13,783 --> 00:04:15,754
as hard as they possibly can.

95
00:04:15,887 --> 00:04:17,260
That's why we come to China.

96
00:04:17,337 --> 00:04:18,615
This is the new China.

97
00:04:18,683 --> 00:04:22,316
We found that the more humane
work environment we have,

98
00:04:22,465 --> 00:04:24,058
the more
sustainable over time.

99
00:04:24,179 --> 00:04:25,676
Over time? No, no.

100
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:29,168
The Box Three has a very limited
window of profitability.

101
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,928
I need you focused on making
as many of them as possible,

102
00:04:31,996 --> 00:04:33,427
as fast as possible.

103
00:04:33,504 --> 00:04:34,557
Gavin.

104
00:04:34,676 --> 00:04:36,959
You know our shameful history

105
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:38,652
of worker suicides.

106
00:04:38,848 --> 00:04:42,223
Since the renovation,
not a single one.

107
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,469
Gavin:
Not even one?

108
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:44,765
Okay.

109
00:04:45,066 --> 00:04:47,301
But there's gotta be
like a middle ground here.

110
00:04:48,751 --> 00:04:50,841
Ah, a happy surprise.

111
00:04:50,926 --> 00:04:52,920
The children from our
daycare center have

112
00:04:52,988 --> 00:04:55,613
prepared a traditional song
just for you.

113
00:04:59,968 --> 00:05:01,371
That's wonderful.

114
00:05:02,134 --> 00:05:04,280
Yao, I need you to give me
30% more output.

115
00:05:04,348 --> 00:05:05,785
I don't care how you do it.

116
00:05:05,853 --> 00:05:07,698
Just a thought,

117
00:05:07,968 --> 00:05:09,926
those kids
don't look that busy.

118
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:19,802
Are you done with...
your chunk yet?

119
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:20,905
Almost done.

120
00:05:20,973 --> 00:05:22,811
Because everyone else
is done.

121
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:24,260
Literally everyone.

122
00:05:24,337 --> 00:05:26,598
47 engineers finished.

123
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,348
One not.

124
00:05:28,672 --> 00:05:29,811
You.

125
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:32,465
Almost there. I'm sure
it'll be worth the wait.

126
00:05:36,183 --> 00:05:38,223
Mmm, no, that's way
too strong for him.

127
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,260
Hey, guys.
How's the code sprint going?

128
00:05:40,337 --> 00:05:41,807
T-minus Dinesh.

129
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:43,858
Jared:
Richard, I am pleased to say

130
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:46,280
that your new assistant
is a quick study.

131
00:05:46,348 --> 00:05:49,092
And per your text, he posted a
well-crafted cease and desist

132
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,765
directed at Jian-Yang
on the Pied Piper website.

133
00:05:51,842 --> 00:05:54,677
I made some judicious edits
to capture your voice,

134
00:05:54,745 --> 00:05:57,457
but the thrust
of the piece was his.

135
00:05:57,717 --> 00:05:59,011
I have a law degree, so.

136
00:05:59,088 --> 00:06:00,219
Well done, Holden.

137
00:06:00,296 --> 00:06:01,557
Is that tea for me?

138
00:06:01,634 --> 00:06:03,141
- It is, indeed.
- Okay. Great.

139
00:06:03,218 --> 00:06:04,483
No, no, no, no, don't.

140
00:06:04,551 --> 00:06:05,629
It's too strong.

141
00:06:05,746 --> 00:06:07,751
Okay.
Water it down.

142
00:06:10,384 --> 00:06:14,011
So, did you speak to Laurie
about our series B?

143
00:06:14,088 --> 00:06:15,107
Sort of.

144
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:17,385
Uh, Gilfoyle, is there
a secure way

145
00:06:17,462 --> 00:06:20,182
of giving someone
access to our servers

146
00:06:20,292 --> 00:06:22,223
while still limiting
and controlling

147
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,654
how much compute
they could use?

148
00:06:23,722 --> 00:06:25,265
I could create
a credit system.

149
00:06:25,342 --> 00:06:28,208
Wait, I'm sorry, Richard.
Who would these credits be for?

150
00:06:28,276 --> 00:06:30,958
Laurie Bream. She made
herself CEO of Eklow.

151
00:06:31,026 --> 00:06:32,318
I'm just trying
to help her out.

152
00:06:32,386 --> 00:06:34,719
Pardon? Do you think you
could set those up by today?

153
00:06:34,796 --> 00:06:36,182
More work. Fantastic.

154
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:38,219
Richard, I don't
quite understand...

155
00:06:38,296 --> 00:06:39,427
Dinesh:
Done!

156
00:06:39,504 --> 00:06:42,487
Done! I am done!

157
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:46,882
Look at this!

158
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,640
Whoo!

159
00:06:49,097 --> 00:06:50,651
Code sprint over.

160
00:06:58,342 --> 00:07:00,223
Uh, congratulations, everybody.

161
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,450
Really, good... good job.

162
00:07:01,518 --> 00:07:04,974
Um, the only thing
left to do now is...

163
00:07:05,136 --> 00:07:09,214
get back to work and review
all the code for errors.

164
00:07:09,376 --> 00:07:10,881
Okay, so...

165
00:07:11,886 --> 00:07:12,902
Okay.

166
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,800
That was an
out-of-body experience.

167
00:07:14,948 --> 00:07:17,143
It was like God
was coding through me.

168
00:07:17,384 --> 00:07:18,599
Time stood still.

169
00:07:18,667 --> 00:07:20,145
Not for the rest of us
it didn't.

170
00:07:20,213 --> 00:07:21,724
Laugh it up, Gilf.

171
00:07:21,801 --> 00:07:24,557
I hear you making your
little jokes at my expense,

172
00:07:24,636 --> 00:07:26,667
turning all the engineers
against me.

173
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,409
But the second
these results go up,

174
00:07:29,495 --> 00:07:33,053
they're all going to see
the only thing that matters...

175
00:07:33,237 --> 00:07:34,849
Who made less errors.

176
00:07:34,995 --> 00:07:36,807
You mean who made
"fewer" errors?

177
00:07:36,917 --> 00:07:38,456
Oh, you think
you're so clever.

178
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:40,192
You know who else
thought it was clever?

179
00:07:40,421 --> 00:07:41,505
The hare.

180
00:07:41,573 --> 00:07:43,932
Right before it was defeated
by the tortoise.

181
00:07:44,009 --> 00:07:46,206
I'm the fucking tortoise,
Gilfoyle.

182
00:07:46,346 --> 00:07:48,888
I'm the fucking tortoise!
Keep saying that.

183
00:07:48,956 --> 00:07:50,778
I can't wait for these
results to go up.

184
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:53,581
Guys? No, no, no. We talked about this.
Remember?

185
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:55,114
You're both
senior management now.

186
00:07:55,182 --> 00:07:57,469
Okay? Your code will be
subject to private review.

187
00:07:57,546 --> 00:07:59,307
No. No, no, no,
not private.

188
00:07:59,384 --> 00:08:01,334
Everyone has to know that
I'm better than Gilfoyle.

189
00:08:01,401 --> 00:08:03,169
I'm sorry.
When it was just us,

190
00:08:03,237 --> 00:08:05,724
a little cocksmanship
was a fun diversion.

191
00:08:05,792 --> 00:08:08,036
But the entire
engineering team's morale

192
00:08:08,104 --> 00:08:10,919
depends on seeing you both
as equally competent leaders.

193
00:08:11,042 --> 00:08:13,130
Danny over there is going
to be reviewing your code,

194
00:08:13,198 --> 00:08:15,971
and keeping the results
completely confidential.

195
00:08:16,657 --> 00:08:17,830
Jared...

196
00:08:18,033 --> 00:08:21,784
I believe we all know
who's the better coder anyway.

197
00:08:21,987 --> 00:08:23,198
Um, Richard?

198
00:08:23,266 --> 00:08:26,917
I'm sorry, I'm still having a little
bit of a hard time understanding.

199
00:08:26,985 --> 00:08:29,783
You went to see Laurie
to get money from her

200
00:08:29,903 --> 00:08:32,940
but now you're giving
our resources to her.

201
00:08:33,449 --> 00:08:34,784
Why would you do that?

202
00:08:34,861 --> 00:08:38,044
Well, honestly Jared,
she was a mess.

203
00:08:38,112 --> 00:08:41,667
And I really,
genuinely felt bad for her.

204
00:08:41,767 --> 00:08:43,189
For Laurie?

205
00:08:44,079 --> 00:08:45,339
Yup.

206
00:08:48,033 --> 00:08:51,706
Richard, you have
an enormous heart.

207
00:08:51,917 --> 00:08:55,914
And I don't mean in the same way
my deceased friend Gloria did,

208
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:57,951
which the doctors should
have really caught

209
00:08:58,028 --> 00:09:00,081
because her knuckles
were gargantuan.

210
00:09:00,176 --> 00:09:02,497
But do you think
in this instance,

211
00:09:02,565 --> 00:09:04,409
you might have
allowed your emotions

212
00:09:04,486 --> 00:09:06,674
to cloud your
business instincts?

213
00:09:06,792 --> 00:09:09,993
Well, I would argue that I made
a very good business decision.

214
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:12,039
Because now,
Laurie is on our side.

215
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:15,604
Which will play out very nicely
when we negotiate our series B.

216
00:09:15,672 --> 00:09:17,692
Okay, Richard,
it is important

217
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,739
to develop emotional self-discipline
for situations like this.

218
00:09:20,807 --> 00:09:23,178
Mm-hmm. Sometimes you
have to numb yourself.

219
00:09:23,366 --> 00:09:24,731
If you wanna work the corner,

220
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:26,826
you can't fall in love
every time you turn a trick.

221
00:09:26,903 --> 00:09:28,307
That's why you do the oxy.

222
00:09:28,393 --> 00:09:31,367
What I'm saying is if you ever
need to develop strategies

223
00:09:31,444 --> 00:09:33,956
to cultivate more
emotional self-control,

224
00:09:34,077 --> 00:09:36,838
obviously I do have some experience.
You do?

225
00:09:36,908 --> 00:09:38,081
Doubtless you've noticed

226
00:09:38,158 --> 00:09:39,909
that I've been pulling
away from you.

227
00:09:40,018 --> 00:09:43,776
Uh, no... no, I can't...
honestly say that I have.

228
00:09:44,197 --> 00:09:45,682
Look at Holden out there.

229
00:09:45,909 --> 00:09:48,052
You think I didn't
love making your tea?

230
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,185
Who wouldn't?

231
00:09:49,253 --> 00:09:50,868
But, when you
anointed me COO,

232
00:09:50,945 --> 00:09:54,367
I learned to stop investing
those feelings in you

233
00:09:54,526 --> 00:09:56,073
for the good of the company.

234
00:09:56,454 --> 00:09:58,674
Call it emotional abstinence.

235
00:09:58,742 --> 00:10:00,042
Jared, look, um,

236
00:10:00,112 --> 00:10:01,862
in regards to
the whole Laurie thing,

237
00:10:01,956 --> 00:10:03,659
I actually think
I made the right call.

238
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:04,743
Alright.
Alright.

239
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,346
Well, I am available.

240
00:10:07,564 --> 00:10:10,549
Not emotionally, obviously.

241
00:10:11,576 --> 00:10:12,658
Got it.

242
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:18,596
Ooh, there's a highly rated
new dim sum establishment

243
00:10:18,664 --> 00:10:21,409
- in this neighborhood.
- Sir, Richard Hendricks just posted

244
00:10:21,486 --> 00:10:23,065
a cease and desist letter.

245
00:10:23,214 --> 00:10:26,720
"unlawful copying of Pied
Piper's proprietary software."

246
00:10:27,049 --> 00:10:28,589
Are you fucking kidding me?

247
00:10:28,674 --> 00:10:30,487
That idiot let someone
steal his code,

248
00:10:30,555 --> 00:10:32,292
so now there might
be two companies

249
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,038
working to make
my box obsolete?

250
00:10:34,164 --> 00:10:36,065
I'll try to find out
who's responsible.

251
00:10:36,158 --> 00:10:40,065
Good luck. HooliMaps says
dim sum is that way.

252
00:10:40,158 --> 00:10:41,698
Right turn, please.

253
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,089
Look! Pied Piper!

254
00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:54,573
Follow that Chinese man.

255
00:10:55,284 --> 00:10:57,049
The Chinese man
on the bicycle.

256
00:10:57,318 --> 00:11:00,198
The Chinese man on the bicycle
in the green Pied Piper t-shirt.

257
00:11:00,266 --> 00:11:01,277
Ah.

258
00:11:01,467 --> 00:11:03,758
Hurry, hurry! Come on!
Don't lose him.

259
00:11:10,201 --> 00:11:11,661
Hey dude, how's it goin'?

260
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:14,120
How's that... review going?

261
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:15,604
Probably done, right?

262
00:11:15,783 --> 00:11:17,057
'Cause it took you no time

263
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:18,835
counting up the bugs
in my stuff?

264
00:11:19,028 --> 00:11:21,616
'Cause I crushed it so hard?

265
00:11:22,706 --> 00:11:24,123
Compared to Gilfoyle?

266
00:11:25,605 --> 00:11:26,605
Right?

267
00:11:29,075 --> 00:11:31,159
I get it. I get it.
It's a secret.

268
00:11:31,332 --> 00:11:33,893
Company morale.
I'm so on board.

269
00:11:34,753 --> 00:11:36,346
I did crush him, right?

270
00:11:37,818 --> 00:11:39,236
He did better than me?

271
00:11:39,477 --> 00:11:40,505
Oh my God.

272
00:11:40,573 --> 00:11:42,299
This is my worst
fucking nightmare.

273
00:11:42,513 --> 00:11:44,025
But not by a lot, right?

274
00:11:44,235 --> 00:11:45,987
He didn't like kick my ass?

275
00:11:47,699 --> 00:11:49,118
He kicked my ass?

276
00:11:49,195 --> 00:11:50,872
That fucker!

277
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,257
Just fucking tell me.

278
00:11:52,325 --> 00:11:54,451
Just fucking tell me
how much he kicked my ass by.

279
00:11:54,528 --> 00:11:55,951
Please just fucking tell me.

280
00:11:56,028 --> 00:11:58,076
I'm not gonna beg.
I'm not gonna beg.

281
00:11:58,153 --> 00:12:01,792
Please? Please?
Please? Please?

282
00:12:02,532 --> 00:12:04,455
Please? Please?

283
00:12:04,532 --> 00:12:05,854
Just please tell me, please.

284
00:12:05,932 --> 00:12:07,123
Okay, fine!

285
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,542
You just have to swear
not to tell anyone, okay?

286
00:12:09,651 --> 00:12:10,956
I swear I won't tell anyone.

287
00:12:11,033 --> 00:12:13,951
Everyone, everyone. I have a very
important announcement to make.

288
00:12:14,028 --> 00:12:15,993
My code was better
than Gilfoyle's.

289
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,216
So it's official.

290
00:12:18,284 --> 00:12:20,492
Gilfoyle is a much worse
coder than me.

291
00:12:20,784 --> 00:12:23,268
I want you all
to look at him.

292
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,847
Good.

293
00:12:24,915 --> 00:12:26,289
Terrible.

294
00:12:26,366 --> 00:12:27,789
Role model.

295
00:12:27,866 --> 00:12:29,419
Hateful pile of trash.

296
00:12:29,505 --> 00:12:30,664
Bullshit.

297
00:12:30,741 --> 00:12:33,497
Says who? Danny told me.
He wasn't supposed to.

298
00:12:33,574 --> 00:12:35,201
Supposed to be a secret
but he told me

299
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:37,438
and now everyone's
laughing at you.

300
00:12:38,987 --> 00:12:40,384
- Everyone's laugh...
- Danny.

301
00:12:40,452 --> 00:12:41,821
What the fuck is going on?

302
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,235
Did his code actually have
less errors than mine?

303
00:12:44,298 --> 00:12:45,508
I don't know
what to tell you.

304
00:12:45,585 --> 00:12:46,956
I checked it three times.

305
00:12:47,024 --> 00:12:48,383
And it's "fewer" errors.

306
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,471
Ooh!

307
00:12:49,548 --> 00:12:51,509
This is the best day
of my life!

308
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,212
Congratulations.

309
00:12:59,223 --> 00:13:00,431
Thank you.

310
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,345
I feel bad for gloating.

311
00:13:03,084 --> 00:13:05,165
In all seriousness,
that means a lot to me.

312
00:13:05,233 --> 00:13:06,377
To show you
I'm a gracious winner,

313
00:13:06,444 --> 00:13:07,684
I'll take you
to a nice restaurant.

314
00:13:07,751 --> 00:13:09,164
Your favorite kind
of restaurant.

315
00:13:09,335 --> 00:13:10,633
A "mis-steak" house!

316
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:13,009
Boom! Get it?
'Cause you suck.

317
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,158
Yes?

318
00:13:33,226 --> 00:13:34,329
Ni hao.

319
00:13:35,234 --> 00:13:36,402
Do you know who I am?

320
00:13:36,665 --> 00:13:38,378
No.
Okay, okay.

321
00:13:38,446 --> 00:13:39,637
Well, I'm the one
who accidentally

322
00:13:39,704 --> 00:13:41,652
struck one of your employees
with my car earlier

323
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,880
and it's a personal habit of
mine to make things right.

324
00:13:43,983 --> 00:13:45,280
So...

325
00:13:46,423 --> 00:13:48,090
Do you mind if I come in?

326
00:13:56,743 --> 00:13:57,930
Okay, what else?

327
00:13:58,007 --> 00:13:59,548
Uh, Colin from
K-Hole Games called,

328
00:13:59,618 --> 00:14:01,079
checking in on the restore.

329
00:14:01,392 --> 00:14:03,019
Put him on the phone sheet.
Next?

330
00:14:03,087 --> 00:14:05,639
Uh, Laurie Bream said that
she received the compute credits

331
00:14:05,707 --> 00:14:07,118
and to say thank you.

332
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:09,388
You see?

333
00:14:09,465 --> 00:14:12,466
Business and compassion
are not mutually exclusive.

334
00:14:12,556 --> 00:14:15,136
In fact, sometimes
going out of your way

335
00:14:15,204 --> 00:14:16,597
to help a fellow colleague

336
00:14:16,665 --> 00:14:18,949
can actually put you
further ahead in business.

337
00:14:19,017 --> 00:14:20,643
Let that be a lesson to you,
young Holden.

338
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:21,735
I'm 30.

339
00:14:21,803 --> 00:14:24,261
And, uh, the CEO of a company
called the Gigglybots called.

340
00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:26,098
He wants to know how to
redeem the compute credits

341
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:27,687
he just bought
from Laurie Bream.

342
00:14:28,986 --> 00:14:30,050
What?

343
00:14:30,118 --> 00:14:32,134
Ariel was apprehended
this morning

344
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:36,313
shoplifting machine oil from
an auto parts store in Turlock.

345
00:14:36,547 --> 00:14:39,501
There was, however,
no sign of Fiona.

346
00:14:39,634 --> 00:14:41,063
And with her missing,

347
00:14:41,132 --> 00:14:43,813
I have no need
for compute power

348
00:14:43,946 --> 00:14:46,175
therefore no need
for your compute credits.

349
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:49,173
Selling them, I think
you'll certainly agree,

350
00:14:49,243 --> 00:14:51,931
was merely a practical
business decision.

351
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,883
Okay, but, I gave you
those credits as a gift.

352
00:14:56,007 --> 00:14:57,304
I was helping you.

353
00:14:57,381 --> 00:14:59,013
You were vomiting, remember?

354
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:01,179
Ah, yes. Admittedly
a moment of weakness.

355
00:15:01,256 --> 00:15:03,092
However, immediately
after your departure

356
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:04,471
I consumed two egg whites

357
00:15:04,548 --> 00:15:06,633
and a green bean
and regained my composure.

358
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,696
Laurie, when someone
gives you a gift

359
00:15:08,797 --> 00:15:11,112
and you don't want it,
you give it back.

360
00:15:11,187 --> 00:15:13,182
Okay? You don't
just go sell that gift

361
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,009
to the next fucking
highest bidder...

362
00:15:15,086 --> 00:15:16,888
Richard, mind your tone.

363
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:19,592
Your lack of emotional
discipline is troubling.

364
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:22,013
You need to work on this.

365
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,550
Or I may have serious doubts

366
00:15:23,627 --> 00:15:25,789
about granting you
your series B.

367
00:15:33,885 --> 00:15:35,469
A lot of computers in here.

368
00:15:35,671 --> 00:15:37,664
I dabble a bit
in tech myself.

369
00:15:39,715 --> 00:15:41,532
All these people working here.

370
00:15:41,727 --> 00:15:43,664
You must have something
coming to market soon.

371
00:15:43,961 --> 00:15:46,471
No. We have trouble
with the government.

372
00:15:46,548 --> 00:15:47,566
I've heard that.

373
00:15:47,634 --> 00:15:49,300
I mean, to even
operate an online platform

374
00:15:49,377 --> 00:15:51,134
inside the People's
Republic of China

375
00:15:51,211 --> 00:15:53,800
you need a government-issued
ICP license, right?

376
00:15:53,877 --> 00:15:55,621
I left a good life.

377
00:15:56,366 --> 00:15:57,532
Free rent.

378
00:15:58,168 --> 00:15:59,388
Great friends.

379
00:15:59,574 --> 00:16:01,324
To fail in China?

380
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:04,374
We try to rewrite code,

381
00:16:04,442 --> 00:16:06,809
but government still
won't give us license.

382
00:16:06,929 --> 00:16:08,356
Maybe we'll quit.

383
00:16:08,512 --> 00:16:10,054
Try something else.

384
00:16:11,757 --> 00:16:13,092
Do you like octopus?

385
00:16:13,169 --> 00:16:14,179
Gavin:
I do.

386
00:16:14,247 --> 00:16:15,934
Is that what
you're working on?

387
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:18,613
That's a decentralized
network, huh?

388
00:16:18,767 --> 00:16:20,945
Wait, what did you do there?

389
00:16:21,207 --> 00:16:23,925
Looks like you removed
the data federation servers.

390
00:16:24,074 --> 00:16:27,388
Yes. And added multicasting
and data projections.

391
00:16:27,606 --> 00:16:29,139
Why? That wouldn't work.

392
00:16:29,207 --> 00:16:31,723
It works. Works fine.

393
00:16:32,864 --> 00:16:35,198
Jian-Yang: Government
still does not like it.

394
00:16:38,506 --> 00:16:39,629
Best of luck.

395
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,371
Thanks for the tour.

396
00:16:43,256 --> 00:16:46,179
Ah, Gavin.
Dim sum closes in 40 minutes.

397
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:48,221
Holy shit!
Holy fucking shit!

398
00:16:48,289 --> 00:16:49,429
That brilliant
little idiot.

399
00:16:49,506 --> 00:16:50,944
He found a way
around the patent.

400
00:16:51,012 --> 00:16:52,277
Sir?
It's Hendricks' Internet,

401
00:16:52,348 --> 00:16:53,398
but it's not
Hendricks' Internet.

402
00:16:53,465 --> 00:16:54,810
I want to share
in your excitement, sir,

403
00:16:54,877 --> 00:16:56,967
but I really don't follow.
That guy in there,

404
00:16:57,168 --> 00:16:59,013
he took Hendricks' software
and changed it.

405
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,428
So much so that
it shouldn't work.

406
00:17:00,496 --> 00:17:01,788
But it does.
He showed me the demo.

407
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:04,038
And here's the thing,
it's different enough

408
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,184
that Hendricks' patent
won't cover it.

409
00:17:06,285 --> 00:17:08,225
Are you sure? Of course
I'm fucking sure.

410
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:09,428
I wrote that patent, Hoover!

411
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:11,122
I've got a hundred
engineers back at Hooli

412
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:12,733
trying to get around it.
They failed.

413
00:17:12,815 --> 00:17:15,139
But somehow that
monosyllabic moron

414
00:17:15,207 --> 00:17:16,555
just stumbled into it.

415
00:17:16,715 --> 00:17:18,097
I need that kid's code.

416
00:17:18,215 --> 00:17:19,975
I hope that book you're
reading is for work.

417
00:17:20,043 --> 00:17:21,890
- Oh, absolutely...
- But if you wanna read for fun,

418
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,725
you should read
Gilfoyle's favorite author,

419
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,304
George "Error" Martin.

420
00:17:25,381 --> 00:17:27,675
Hear that? We're all making
jokes at your expense.

421
00:17:27,752 --> 00:17:29,304
Is that what's happening?

422
00:17:29,598 --> 00:17:33,686
As your supervisor, I wanted to inform
you that there is a first aid kit,

423
00:17:33,754 --> 00:17:35,600
but if you need blood,
don't go to Gilfoyle

424
00:17:35,669 --> 00:17:36,925
'cause he's type-O.

425
00:17:37,121 --> 00:17:38,215
Typo!

426
00:17:39,027 --> 00:17:40,946
They love it.
They're all laughing at you.

427
00:17:41,086 --> 00:17:43,805
Pixar's hit animated
motion picture "Toy Story."

428
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:46,574
Pixar's hit animated motion
picture "Toy Story."

429
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,304
Pixar's... oh hey!

430
00:17:48,381 --> 00:17:49,592
Were you guys talking about

431
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:52,028
Pixar's hit animated
motion picture "Toy Story"?

432
00:17:52,106 --> 00:17:54,114
No. 'Cause Gilfoyle's
favorite character

433
00:17:54,211 --> 00:17:56,131
is "Bugs" Lightyear.

434
00:17:56,895 --> 00:17:58,756
We're all laughing
at you, Gilfoyle.

435
00:17:58,824 --> 00:18:00,400
Are you
still at Eklow? Uh, no.

436
00:18:00,627 --> 00:18:02,009
I'm back at the office.

437
00:18:02,086 --> 00:18:03,930
You know, Jared was right.

438
00:18:04,121 --> 00:18:06,592
I showed compassion
to someone who deserves none.

439
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:08,762
Nothing is personal with Laurie.

440
00:18:08,848 --> 00:18:11,231
Alright? It's what makes her
such a great VC.

441
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:12,754
And in all candor,

442
00:18:12,824 --> 00:18:14,663
a very challenging
business partner.

443
00:18:14,731 --> 00:18:17,281
I gotta be honest, it's really
nice not having her in the office.

444
00:18:17,348 --> 00:18:20,733
Yeah, well, now I have to buy
my own compute credits back

445
00:18:20,801 --> 00:18:22,156
with money I don't have...
It's that one.

446
00:18:22,223 --> 00:18:24,805
Which was the whole point
of getting series B.

447
00:18:24,882 --> 00:18:26,226
I'm telling you,
unless you have money

448
00:18:26,293 --> 00:18:28,192
you can't get... Excuse me.

449
00:18:29,606 --> 00:18:31,738
Richard. Hello.

450
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,383
I'm gonna have
to call you back.

451
00:18:33,451 --> 00:18:34,538
Richard?

452
00:18:34,606 --> 00:18:35,987
- What the...
- Pied Piper, right?

453
00:18:36,055 --> 00:18:38,000
Uh, yeah.
What is she doing here?

454
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,940
How did she...
Credit card works,

455
00:18:40,008 --> 00:18:41,387
I don't ask questions.

456
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,237
Well this is fucking weird.

457
00:18:44,305 --> 00:18:45,555
I've seen weirder.

458
00:18:45,689 --> 00:18:46,815
So should I just...

459
00:18:46,883 --> 00:18:48,882
leave it on the sidewalk
or what?

460
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:52,026
$50,000 for the whole thing.

461
00:18:52,094 --> 00:18:53,055
All you have to do

462
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,321
is give me your hard drive
with the code base on it.

463
00:18:55,585 --> 00:18:57,550
Oh, and the underlying rights
to the code

464
00:18:57,627 --> 00:18:59,675
in perpetuity
throughout the universe.

465
00:18:59,752 --> 00:19:00,977
Sign there.

466
00:19:03,632 --> 00:19:06,040
No.
Okay.

467
00:19:06,594 --> 00:19:08,258
I like the way you negotiate.

468
00:19:08,335 --> 00:19:09,495
$100,000.

469
00:19:09,563 --> 00:19:11,839
Final offer.
Take it or leave it.

470
00:19:17,298 --> 00:19:20,696
He said, "If oil company
wants to buy your house,

471
00:19:20,774 --> 00:19:22,763
there is oil underneath."

472
00:19:22,891 --> 00:19:24,216
But, I'm not an oil company.

473
00:19:24,293 --> 00:19:27,032
No, you are Gavin Belson.

474
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,842
Oh, so you do know who I am.

475
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:30,211
I'm smart.

476
00:19:30,555 --> 00:19:32,034
Just name your price.

477
00:19:32,102 --> 00:19:34,188
I'm not going
to sell you my code

478
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:36,174
until I know why you want it.

479
00:19:38,704 --> 00:19:40,000
Good-bye.

480
00:19:43,632 --> 00:19:44,844
Hello.

481
00:19:45,007 --> 00:19:48,219
Whoa.
This is so cool.

482
00:19:48,882 --> 00:19:49,930
So, uh...

483
00:19:50,007 --> 00:19:51,304
apparently Ariel and I

484
00:19:51,381 --> 00:19:53,633
were the only people
that talked to her

485
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:54,875
and he's in jail.

486
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:58,495
So... she came looking
for me at Pied Piper.

487
00:19:58,673 --> 00:20:00,547
And you brought her here?

488
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:03,393
- Can we keep it?
- No. No, we cannot.

489
00:20:03,461 --> 00:20:05,276
Richard,
she's stolen property.

490
00:20:05,344 --> 00:20:06,386
And she's worth a fortune.

491
00:20:06,454 --> 00:20:08,305
We... we have to take her
back to Laurie.

492
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,633
Fiona, what's 12 times 157?

493
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:15,675
Twelve times 157 is 1,884.

494
00:20:15,752 --> 00:20:17,680
So cool.

495
00:20:17,851 --> 00:20:19,100
Hey, is she right?

496
00:20:20,132 --> 00:20:23,743
Hey Siri,
what's 12 times 157?

497
00:20:23,868 --> 00:20:25,592
It's 1,884.

498
00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:27,638
Oh, no way!

499
00:20:27,715 --> 00:20:29,175
Richard...
No, no, no. Look.

500
00:20:29,252 --> 00:20:32,471
You were right. I was lacking
in emotional discipline.

501
00:20:32,594 --> 00:20:34,175
And I'm not gonna
let that happen again.

502
00:20:34,352 --> 00:20:35,612
From now on,

503
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,495
I'm leaving my emotions
off the fucking table, baby!

504
00:20:38,563 --> 00:20:40,717
Okay, but... Laurie's gonna
get her robot back.

505
00:20:40,794 --> 00:20:41,925
Tomorrow.

506
00:20:41,993 --> 00:20:44,347
After she gives us
something in return.

507
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:48,079
A signed series B
term sheet.

508
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:50,882
Laurie Bream, please.

509
00:20:52,757 --> 00:20:55,313
Oh, you bet your
fucking ass, I'll hold.

510
00:20:56,719 --> 00:20:58,690
I'm not asking you
to cut off his testicles

511
00:20:58,758 --> 00:20:59,918
and shove 'em down his throat,

512
00:20:59,985 --> 00:21:02,079
shoot him in the back
of the head Triad style.

513
00:21:02,156 --> 00:21:04,158
I just need you to get
this kid's code for me.

514
00:21:04,235 --> 00:21:06,079
By whatever means necessary.

515
00:21:06,313 --> 00:21:08,672
That is to say through
extortion or threats.

516
00:21:08,836 --> 00:21:10,336
Well...
Gavin.

517
00:21:10,805 --> 00:21:12,829
As I told you,
this is new China.

518
00:21:12,906 --> 00:21:13,871
Things have changed.

519
00:21:13,948 --> 00:21:15,626
You're telling me you
run a factory this big

520
00:21:15,693 --> 00:21:17,292
and you have
no connections to the Party?

521
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:19,340
No way to help
this kid see the light?

522
00:21:19,408 --> 00:21:20,628
Come on!

523
00:21:20,823 --> 00:21:23,817
Look, Yao, either you convince
this kid to sell his code to me,

524
00:21:23,934 --> 00:21:25,121
or I'm pulling
my box contract

525
00:21:25,189 --> 00:21:26,380
and I'm taking it
somewhere else.

526
00:21:26,447 --> 00:21:27,833
There are plenty
of other countries

527
00:21:27,901 --> 00:21:29,824
in this part of the world
with cheap labor pools.

528
00:21:29,901 --> 00:21:31,866
There's no new Bangladesh.

529
00:21:31,943 --> 00:21:34,137
There's just Bangladesh.

530
00:21:36,739 --> 00:21:38,371
I'll see what I can do.

531
00:21:38,677 --> 00:21:39,988
Excellent.

532
00:21:41,479 --> 00:21:43,123
Jared, I told Laurie

533
00:21:43,191 --> 00:21:45,553
that we'd get Fiona
back to Eklow around 9:00.

534
00:21:45,621 --> 00:21:46,537
So, when you get here

535
00:21:46,614 --> 00:21:48,551
just pull up to the garage
and we'll...

536
00:21:50,156 --> 00:21:52,829
Oh shit, oh shit,
oh shit, oh shit! She's gone!

537
00:21:52,906 --> 00:21:54,491
She escaped.
How the fuck did she...

538
00:21:54,568 --> 00:21:55,785
What?

539
00:21:56,355 --> 00:21:57,495
Wait, where?

540
00:21:57,572 --> 00:21:59,532
It's kind of
hard to explain, but...

541
00:21:59,863 --> 00:22:03,329
a campfire smells sad

542
00:22:03,457 --> 00:22:05,950
and exciting
at the same time.

543
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,496
Fiona:
I understand.

544
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:08,934
Yeah?

545
00:22:09,957 --> 00:22:11,329
Hey.
Hey!

546
00:22:11,406 --> 00:22:12,616
What are you doing out here?

547
00:22:12,693 --> 00:22:14,051
Oh, uh, well...

548
00:22:14,137 --> 00:22:16,512
a few hours
into our conversation,

549
00:22:16,605 --> 00:22:18,871
Fiona mentioned she'd
never seen the ocean.

550
00:22:19,113 --> 00:22:20,829
So I thought about
driving her there

551
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:22,451
but then I realized
since it was dark

552
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:24,803
she wouldn't really
appreciate its majesty

553
00:22:24,871 --> 00:22:27,449
so I brought her out here
to the pool.

554
00:22:28,364 --> 00:22:32,043
So you've just been out
here all night, talking...

555
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:33,506
to a robot?

556
00:22:33,574 --> 00:22:37,156
Fiona, would you excuse
us for a second?

557
00:22:38,386 --> 00:22:39,598
Yes.

558
00:22:40,614 --> 00:22:42,033
Come on. Come here.

559
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,329
Okay.

560
00:22:43,406 --> 00:22:47,245
I know that Fiona is a man-made
piece of digital equipment

561
00:22:47,322 --> 00:22:48,959
Okay. powered by
artificial intelligence.

562
00:22:49,027 --> 00:22:51,033
- Good.
- But the level of that intelligence

563
00:22:51,118 --> 00:22:53,467
is... it's gobsmacking!

564
00:22:53,535 --> 00:22:56,329
I mean, I don't remember
ever having a conversation

565
00:22:56,406 --> 00:22:58,370
like the one
I've been having with her

566
00:22:58,447 --> 00:22:59,616
over the last 12 hours.

567
00:22:59,693 --> 00:23:00,920
Twelve hours?

568
00:23:00,988 --> 00:23:02,354
We have so much in common.

569
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:03,761
We discussed our phobias.

570
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:08,012
I told her that I was afraid
of being found out as a fraud.

571
00:23:08,198 --> 00:23:10,949
And she told me that
she's afraid of magnets.

572
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:13,574
Look, Richard,
we felt a connection.

573
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,069
It's funny.

574
00:23:15,137 --> 00:23:16,121
The past few weeks,

575
00:23:16,198 --> 00:23:18,491
I've been feeling irritable
and short-tempered

576
00:23:18,568 --> 00:23:20,621
and here I am
on no sleep at all

577
00:23:20,698 --> 00:23:21,803
and I just feel...

578
00:23:21,871 --> 00:23:22,961
woo-hoo-hoo!

579
00:23:23,029 --> 00:23:24,101
You know?

580
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:25,186
Hey, Jared?

581
00:23:25,254 --> 00:23:26,318
Yes, sir?

582
00:23:26,386 --> 00:23:28,780
You know how
you've been practicing,

583
00:23:28,848 --> 00:23:29,938
your words,

584
00:23:30,038 --> 00:23:31,908
- "emotional abstinence" on me?
- Yeah-huh.

585
00:23:31,985 --> 00:23:33,537
- Yuh-huh.
- Okay.

586
00:23:33,614 --> 00:23:36,824
Well, do you think that it's maybe at
all possible that because of this,

587
00:23:36,901 --> 00:23:39,741
you've got some
pent-up emotional energy

588
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:42,245
and last night
you had the chance

589
00:23:42,313 --> 00:23:45,627
to release some of that
pent-up emotional energy

590
00:23:45,695 --> 00:23:48,443
onto the robot?

591
00:23:48,671 --> 00:23:50,787
Her name is Fiona.

592
00:23:51,006 --> 00:23:53,662
Alright, well,
I'm shutting her down

593
00:23:53,739 --> 00:23:54,991
and returning her.

594
00:23:55,068 --> 00:23:56,823
Wait, wait, wait. Okay.

595
00:23:57,807 --> 00:23:59,725
What if we didn't
give her back?

596
00:23:59,818 --> 00:24:01,329
What if we called Laurie?

597
00:24:01,436 --> 00:24:03,256
We could negotiate
some kind of a deal.

598
00:24:03,324 --> 00:24:06,414
Jared, whatever happened to
emotional discipline, right?

599
00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:08,389
Feelings, and business...

600
00:24:08,459 --> 00:24:10,357
It's over man. Okay?

601
00:24:10,735 --> 00:24:11,990
It's over.

602
00:24:17,447 --> 00:24:19,407
Okay, stop looking
at me, please.

603
00:24:19,484 --> 00:24:21,322
Just look... look up there.

604
00:24:22,489 --> 00:24:25,531
It's daytime,
but I can see the moon.

605
00:24:33,087 --> 00:24:35,803
Okay, do you want to...
Do you want to ride with us

606
00:24:35,871 --> 00:24:37,772
while we take
her back to Eklow?

607
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:40,553
Oh yes! Playground games.

608
00:24:41,023 --> 00:24:44,068
Gilfoyle likes to play
"Suck Suck Goose."

609
00:24:45,531 --> 00:24:49,116
Oh! Or it could be
"Duck Duck Goofs."

610
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:50,772
Danny?

611
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,407
Do those qualify
as two separate insults?

612
00:24:53,484 --> 00:24:55,936
Uh, yeah.
I believe they do.

613
00:24:59,171 --> 00:25:00,344
Why did he gong?

614
00:25:00,531 --> 00:25:03,574
Because I told the engineers
that if you thought you had won,

615
00:25:03,651 --> 00:25:05,241
which you definitely have not,

616
00:25:05,318 --> 00:25:08,324
it would take you less than
24 hours to cobble together

617
00:25:08,401 --> 00:25:10,912
200 uniquely terrible insults.

618
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,194
Which you have just done.

619
00:25:13,356 --> 00:25:16,321
That is why I had Danny
tell you you won.

620
00:25:16,531 --> 00:25:17,864
Is that true, Danny?

621
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:20,803
Did Gilfoyle really...
beat me?

622
00:25:21,466 --> 00:25:23,097
Private audit. Can't say.

623
00:25:23,948 --> 00:25:25,741
So we don't know
who actually won?

624
00:25:25,818 --> 00:25:28,060
The code contest, no.

625
00:25:28,329 --> 00:25:30,207
But, while you were
running around

626
00:25:30,277 --> 00:25:32,866
racking your tiny brain
for shitty insults,

627
00:25:32,943 --> 00:25:36,075
I was quietly plodding
towards this victory.

628
00:25:36,263 --> 00:25:37,724
You see...

629
00:25:38,531 --> 00:25:40,942
it is I who am the tortoise.

630
00:25:41,152 --> 00:25:43,829
And you are the hairy Arab

631
00:25:43,906 --> 00:25:46,696
who can now
chortle my balls.

632
00:25:50,572 --> 00:25:52,070
What's happening?

633
00:25:52,138 --> 00:25:53,287
Why did you do that?

634
00:25:53,364 --> 00:25:55,491
Right after you forced me
to set Dinesh up,

635
00:25:55,568 --> 00:25:57,871
I told the other engineers
that if you won

636
00:25:57,948 --> 00:25:59,537
you'd immediately insult Dinesh

637
00:25:59,614 --> 00:26:02,427
by saying something
sexually demeaning or racist.

638
00:26:02,497 --> 00:26:03,741
And you just did both.

639
00:26:03,818 --> 00:26:05,083
I see.

640
00:26:05,281 --> 00:26:06,829
Fun at my expense.

641
00:26:06,906 --> 00:26:08,624
Now if it's alright with
upper management,

642
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:10,158
we have a shit ton
of work to do.

643
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:13,146
Yeah,
like so frickin' much.

644
00:26:17,037 --> 00:26:18,286
Assholes.

645
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:20,888
I wanna fire Danny.

646
00:26:21,877 --> 00:26:22,997
Do it.

647
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,364
I'll ask Richard.

648
00:26:27,073 --> 00:26:29,091
We are at Eklow Labs.

649
00:26:29,864 --> 00:26:31,458
Yes, we are.

650
00:26:31,614 --> 00:26:33,614
The site of my creation.

651
00:26:36,356 --> 00:26:37,446
Richard?

652
00:26:37,771 --> 00:26:40,579
Do you think if I asked,
they would let me visit her?

653
00:26:40,656 --> 00:26:42,216
Jared, she's gonna be okay.

654
00:26:42,388 --> 00:26:45,324
Alright? She's gonna be plugged
back into her old servers,

655
00:26:45,401 --> 00:26:47,245
surrounded
by familiar engineers,

656
00:26:47,322 --> 00:26:49,449
sitting on the table
where she was born.

657
00:26:49,833 --> 00:26:53,817
I promise.
She's going to be fine.

658
00:26:57,614 --> 00:27:00,474
Extreme care with the
optical sensors, gentlemen.

659
00:27:01,031 --> 00:27:03,495
Boston Dynamics
needs them overnighted.

660
00:27:03,563 --> 00:27:04,649
I don't understand.

661
00:27:04,717 --> 00:27:07,121
Fiona is this company's
most valuable asset.

662
00:27:07,198 --> 00:27:09,866
Yes, and as such she will
garner the highest return

663
00:27:09,943 --> 00:27:13,567
when I have her dismantled
and sold off for parts.

664
00:27:16,328 --> 00:27:20,060
So you're just gonna
take all this promising tech

665
00:27:20,153 --> 00:27:21,445
and liquidate it?

666
00:27:21,513 --> 00:27:23,312
- Yes. As quickly as I'm able.
- Dude,

667
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,606
check it out.

668
00:27:24,694 --> 00:27:26,169
I'm a robot.

669
00:27:26,247 --> 00:27:30,406
Richard, being a CEO
is a terrible waste of time.

670
00:27:30,474 --> 00:27:32,046
And a horrible way to make a living.

671
00:27:32,114 --> 00:27:34,458
I'll be returning to
Bream-Hall immediately.

672
00:27:35,021 --> 00:27:37,919
Speaking of... as promised.

673
00:27:38,364 --> 00:27:40,746
A term sheet
for your series B.

674
00:27:40,856 --> 00:27:42,491
Congratulations, Richard.

675
00:27:42,653 --> 00:27:43,908
Thank you.

676
00:27:45,332 --> 00:27:47,794
See? Silver lining.

677
00:27:48,638 --> 00:27:49,687
I told you...

678
00:27:49,755 --> 00:27:51,515
Wait, uh.
Hey, Jared...

679
00:27:51,583 --> 00:27:53,299
Don't... Don't go over there.
Don't look in that.

680
00:27:53,366 --> 00:27:55,372
Oh, Fiona...

681
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,121
Come on, let's...

682
00:27:57,388 --> 00:27:59,208
Let's get out of here, huh?

683
00:27:59,276 --> 00:28:00,749
What do you say
we go to the office

684
00:28:00,817 --> 00:28:02,171
and you can make
me some tea?

685
00:28:02,239 --> 00:28:03,743
That might
make you feel better?

686
00:28:13,632 --> 00:28:15,008
So, did he sign?

687
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:16,474
It's done.

688
00:28:16,555 --> 00:28:18,026
Fuck yes!

689
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:19,492
How'd you get him to do it?

690
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,435
I made it clear
it would be better for him

691
00:28:21,513 --> 00:28:23,996
to hand over the company
and leave town immediately.

692
00:28:24,073 --> 00:28:26,286
That's some old
Chinese shit right there.

693
00:28:26,376 --> 00:28:28,450
I told you,
you're a badass, Yao.

694
00:28:29,489 --> 00:28:31,927
Wait, this lists you
as the buyer, not me.

695
00:28:32,028 --> 00:28:34,251
So, what's the plan here? You're
gonna sign it over to me then?

696
00:28:34,318 --> 00:28:38,513
Gavin, I'm afraid I will no longer
be able to manufacture your boxes.

697
00:28:38,825 --> 00:28:40,888
You see, my company
will be too busy

698
00:28:41,065 --> 00:28:42,817
manufacturing a new device,

699
00:28:43,106 --> 00:28:47,124
built on a radically better
technology that I now own

700
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:49,411
that will quickly
render yours obsolete.

701
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,692
Here in China, and,

702
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:54,075
according to the U.S.
patent office,

703
00:28:54,152 --> 00:28:56,072
in America as well.

704
00:28:57,115 --> 00:28:59,405
Oh, the children
have returned to sing for you.

705
00:29:07,198 --> 00:29:10,787
<i>♪ My chains, new gold watch,
made in China ♪</i>

706
00:29:10,864 --> 00:29:14,204

Any one of these millennials
can buy one.

720
00:30:23,312 --> 00:30:24,693
How would you feel
if your neighbors

721
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,723
got a Tiki head bigger
than yours?

722
00:30:29,115 --> 00:30:30,746
I've been keeping
track of the credits

723
00:30:30,823 --> 00:30:31,829
that you gave to Laurie.

724
00:30:31,906 --> 00:30:33,459
If we buy them back,
how much would it cost?

725
00:30:33,526 --> 00:30:36,198
- One-point-six-million dollars.
- What?

726
00:30:36,489 --> 00:30:38,950
You want
an alternative to Laurie Bream?

727
00:30:39,027 --> 00:30:40,662
Well, it's Pied Piper coin.

728
00:30:40,739 --> 00:30:41,663
Before you walk away,

729
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,158
there's a friend
you should talk to.

730
00:30:43,235 --> 00:30:45,505
- You did 36 ICOs? Did they work?
- Yup.

731
00:30:45,573 --> 00:30:48,393
It's not always about money.
Sometimes, it's about wisdom.

732
00:30:48,487 --> 00:30:49,864
So, you lost it all?

733
00:30:49,932 --> 00:30:52,372
Richard! If I didn't
love this crazy guy so much,

734
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,456
I'd knock his teeth out.
