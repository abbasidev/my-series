1
00:00:02,313 --> 00:00:03,941
Jian-Yang, are... Are you copying

2
00:00:03,966 --> 00:00:06,048
all those companies
for the Chinese markets?

3
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:08,507
Oh, no.

4
00:00:09,757 --> 00:00:11,339
Are you suggesting that

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,047
someone in here is leaking
info to Gavin Belson?

6
00:00:14,048 --> 00:00:15,881
Tell me about these... fridges.

7
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:17,423
It's a company secret.

8
00:00:17,424 --> 00:00:19,798
Do you want to save a fortune, or not?

9
00:00:19,799 --> 00:00:20,799
Well, yes.

10
00:00:20,966 --> 00:00:22,923
In exchange, I need you
to do something for me,

11
00:00:22,924 --> 00:00:25,132
with regard to the people
who hacked your refrigerators.

12
00:00:25,382 --> 00:00:27,048
I'm going to destroy their lives.

13
00:00:27,632 --> 00:00:30,965
Jared, do you think
it's... time we hire a COO?

14
00:00:30,966 --> 00:00:32,840
You're 20-30 pounds underweight.

15
00:00:32,841 --> 00:00:34,089
Don't worry about him.

16
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,132
We're gonna find you a much better COO.

17
00:00:36,757 --> 00:00:37,924
You want the job?

18
00:00:38,507 --> 00:00:41,107
All right... Ugh. All right.

19
00:00:48,957 --> 00:00:51,456
Okay, everybody, um, thanks for coming.

20
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:52,923
Uh, sorry about the venue.

21
00:00:52,924 --> 00:00:55,213
We had a minor security issue.

22
00:00:55,213 --> 00:00:56,673
I didn't feel comfortable

23
00:00:56,674 --> 00:00:58,339
hosting you guys at... at our offices.

24
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,049
But, hey, at least out here,

25
00:01:00,152 --> 00:01:01,526
we don't run the risk

26
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,589
of running into anyone
from the tech industry.

27
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:05,965
Yeah, they're all so old.

28
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:08,047
- But they look so happy.
- Yeah.

29
00:01:08,314 --> 00:01:09,397
It's weird.

30
00:01:09,397 --> 00:01:10,967
I don't understand it either.

31
00:01:11,355 --> 00:01:13,084
Anyway, I wanted you guys to meet,

32
00:01:13,188 --> 00:01:16,145
because despite being a very diverse

33
00:01:16,146 --> 00:01:18,994
and talented group of
young web developers...

34
00:01:19,136 --> 00:01:21,854
Goodscape, huh? Social coding platform.

35
00:01:21,855 --> 00:01:23,895
Tholio, analytics firm.

36
00:01:23,896 --> 00:01:25,563
Plucky, music streaming.

37
00:01:25,564 --> 00:01:27,062
FirstSight, dating site.

38
00:01:27,063 --> 00:01:28,563
Gay dating site.

39
00:01:28,564 --> 00:01:31,229
Okay, technically, you're a dating site,

40
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,229
but specifically, a gay one.

41
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:35,354
Which is a subset, so I'm not wrong.

42
00:01:35,355 --> 00:01:37,646
Anyway, uh, despite all our differences,

43
00:01:37,647 --> 00:01:39,766
we all have one thing in common, right?

44
00:01:40,105 --> 00:01:42,020
A signed agreement with me

45
00:01:42,021 --> 00:01:44,563
to build and launch your websites,

46
00:01:44,564 --> 00:01:47,927
not on the tired, bloated, old web,

47
00:01:47,967 --> 00:01:50,979
but on the new Internet of the future.

48
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,354
The Pipernet.

49
00:01:52,355 --> 00:01:55,149
Which is why, from this day forward,

50
00:01:55,313 --> 00:01:57,312
I'm going to be naming the eight of you...

51
00:01:57,313 --> 00:01:58,896
the OctoPipers.

52
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:03,396
Until something better, TBD.

53
00:02:03,397 --> 00:02:04,688
So when can we tell people?

54
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:06,104
Soon! Actually, very soon.

55
00:02:06,105 --> 00:02:09,470
Uh, next Tuesday, Gavin Belson is, uh...

56
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:11,187
launching his Box Three.

57
00:02:11,188 --> 00:02:13,187
So, um, the day before,

58
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:16,562
we are going to announce our
partnerships with you all,

59
00:02:16,564 --> 00:02:18,062
and beat him to the punch.

60
00:02:18,063 --> 00:02:19,979
Shit. He's gonna be super pissed.

61
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,604
He's really gonna come after us.

62
00:02:21,605 --> 00:02:23,743
Yeah, he is, but fuck him.

63
00:02:23,896 --> 00:02:25,237
Not butt fuck him.

64
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:27,354
- Just...
- You don't have to explain

65
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,396
that kinda stuff. I-I know what you mean.

66
00:02:29,397 --> 00:02:31,271
Yeah, I know. Look... look.

67
00:02:31,272 --> 00:02:33,271
As long as we stick together,

68
00:02:33,272 --> 00:02:35,437
and support each other, we can crush him.

69
00:02:35,438 --> 00:02:37,854
Because what we are doing is amazing, okay?

70
00:02:37,855 --> 00:02:40,062
We are building the
world's first truly open,

71
00:02:40,063 --> 00:02:42,970
truly free de-centralized Internet.

72
00:02:43,423 --> 00:02:46,604
And I tell you what, I got a
sneak preview for you guys, okay?

73
00:02:46,605 --> 00:02:48,271
Because as of this morning,

74
00:02:49,324 --> 00:02:51,478
- messaging is live.
- What!

75
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:53,175
- Cool.
- Yeah.

76
00:02:53,175 --> 00:02:54,633
Really? So cool!

77
00:02:54,634 --> 00:02:55,839
So...

78
00:02:56,386 --> 00:02:58,635
right now, I will send to you all

79
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:00,134
the very first message

80
00:03:00,135 --> 00:03:03,926
ever to be sent on a de-centralized,
peer-to-peer Internet.

81
00:03:04,513 --> 00:03:06,221
Ready?

82
00:03:08,224 --> 00:03:09,388
"Hit her."

83
00:03:09,681 --> 00:03:11,870
I don't get it. Are you talking about me?

84
00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:13,301
I meant to say "Hi there."

85
00:03:13,302 --> 00:03:15,518
Well, it definitely says "Hit her."

86
00:03:15,518 --> 00:03:17,350
I'll try it again. There's a new one.

87
00:03:17,351 --> 00:03:18,976
There. "Hi there."

88
00:03:18,977 --> 00:03:20,893
"Hi there, Hitler."

89
00:03:20,894 --> 00:03:22,019
Goddammit.

90
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,065
Hey, Richard?

91
00:03:24,226 --> 00:03:25,517
You don't have any issue with us

92
00:03:25,518 --> 00:03:27,919
being an exclusively gay site, do you?

93
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,920
What? No!

94
00:03:28,921 --> 00:03:30,585
No, it's... It's totally cool.

95
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:33,627
Oh! Wait a minute, no, I
don't mean you are anti-gay.

96
00:03:33,628 --> 00:03:35,126
I mean the opposite. Like, are you worried

97
00:03:35,127 --> 00:03:37,043
that we're excluding straight people?

98
00:03:37,044 --> 00:03:38,293
Oh. I just remember you said,

99
00:03:38,294 --> 00:03:40,710
you want your new Internet
to be open for everybody,

100
00:03:40,711 --> 00:03:43,585
and, you know, I just want to make
sure we're jibing with your vision.

101
00:03:43,586 --> 00:03:46,085
Deedee, we are psyched to have you aboard.

102
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:48,418
Exclude all the straight people you want.

103
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:49,585
- You sure?
- Yep.

104
00:03:49,586 --> 00:03:51,543
Because we're not snobs about it.

105
00:03:51,544 --> 00:03:52,960
I mean, between you and me,

106
00:03:52,961 --> 00:03:54,126
I'm dreadfully boring.

107
00:03:54,127 --> 00:03:55,996
I might as well be straight myself.

108
00:03:56,211 --> 00:03:58,085
I've been with the same
man for seven years.

109
00:03:58,086 --> 00:03:59,543
I go to church every Sunday.

110
00:03:59,544 --> 00:04:00,627
Look, it... it's all good.

111
00:04:00,628 --> 00:04:03,089
FirstSight is a gay dating site.

112
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:06,023
And... and I will sing
it from the rooftops.

113
00:04:06,169 --> 00:04:07,377
Alright, well, thank you, Richard.

114
00:04:07,378 --> 00:04:08,627
I think this is gonna be great.

115
00:04:08,628 --> 00:04:09,593
Cool.

116
00:04:11,286 --> 00:04:12,619
Yeah. Okay.

117
00:04:12,644 --> 00:04:14,560
- Don't be weird.
- I didn't know what we'd be doing.

118
00:04:19,894 --> 00:04:20,919
So...

119
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,752
everybody is very psyched.

120
00:04:22,753 --> 00:04:24,835
You know who else is
psyched? I'll give you a hint.

121
00:04:24,836 --> 00:04:27,794
They have four thumbs, and
they are these two guys.

122
00:04:27,795 --> 00:04:29,960
- I am very excited.
- I am giddy!

123
00:04:29,961 --> 00:04:31,669
Okay, what... What happened?

124
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,122
We found the mole.

125
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:34,876
- What?
- Yeah.

126
00:04:34,876 --> 00:04:36,166
Who? How?

127
00:04:36,168 --> 00:04:37,740
Good old-fashioned police work.

128
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:41,042
I skimmed through all 40,000
of the staff's outgoing emails.

129
00:04:41,043 --> 00:04:42,585
- Yeah?
- And in addition to learning

130
00:04:42,586 --> 00:04:44,793
that we need to revise
the office dating policy,

131
00:04:44,794 --> 00:04:47,418
because it is, essentially,
the Olympic Village out there,

132
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:49,501
I learned that someone has been sending

133
00:04:49,502 --> 00:04:51,084
a number of encrypted messages

134
00:04:51,085 --> 00:04:53,376
but using Gilfoyle's purloined NSA tools...

135
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:56,836
I can't hold this smile forever,
Jared. Get to the good stuff.

136
00:04:57,086 --> 00:04:59,209
One of our coders has been sending info

137
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:00,752
straight to Hooli High Command.

138
00:05:03,847 --> 00:05:04,876
Wow.

139
00:05:04,877 --> 00:05:07,418
How the fuck did the mole
get all this information?

140
00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:11,293
By exploiting our most glaring weakness.

141
00:05:11,294 --> 00:05:13,418
 You were working as a waitress

142
00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:15,585
In a cocktail bar

143
00:05:15,586 --> 00:05:19,126
When I met Jeff

144
00:05:26,767 --> 00:05:29,069
Synced and corrected by louvette
www.addic7ed.com

145
00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:31,917
No, no, no. You guys have it all wrong.

146
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:33,959
Okay? There's no way Jeff is the mole.

147
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,585
Okay? It's not Jeff.

148
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:37,293
Right, Jeff?

149
00:05:39,204 --> 00:05:40,297
Jeff?

150
00:05:41,043 --> 00:05:42,877
What about Dave & Buster's, Jeff?

151
00:05:44,168 --> 00:05:46,042
What about that time I
got a bullseye in Skee-Ball

152
00:05:46,043 --> 00:05:47,209
and yelled out, "Bazinga!"

153
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:48,835
And you said, "Okay."

154
00:05:49,054 --> 00:05:51,095
You can't fake enthusiasm like that.

155
00:05:52,168 --> 00:05:53,501
Well, I did.

156
00:05:53,502 --> 00:05:55,209
You Judas.

157
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,209
You cow-handed poltroon!

158
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:59,001
We... We thought you were a Stallion!

159
00:05:59,002 --> 00:06:00,835
You're no Stallion.

160
00:06:00,836 --> 00:06:02,501
What is it with you guys and stallions?

161
00:06:02,502 --> 00:06:04,668
What's with you being a rat fuck?

162
00:06:04,807 --> 00:06:07,835
You signed a very aggressive
Non-Disclosure Agreement...

163
00:06:07,836 --> 00:06:09,668
which you are in breach of.

164
00:06:10,693 --> 00:06:12,667
Which means, we can fire you, obviously,

165
00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:16,001
and then have you arrested,
and thrown in jail.

166
00:06:16,002 --> 00:06:19,418
But Gavin would then know we are on to you,

167
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:20,575
so here's the deal.

168
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:23,917
You're gonna come into
the office every day,

169
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:25,793
and sit down at your fucking workstation,

170
00:06:25,794 --> 00:06:27,543
and pretend like nothing's wrong.

171
00:06:27,544 --> 00:06:28,751
Fine.

172
00:06:29,877 --> 00:06:31,544
Uh, that was mine.

173
00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:34,768
Bummer.

174
00:06:35,304 --> 00:06:38,042
"The irony is, the
Internet, which we all use

175
00:06:38,043 --> 00:06:39,876
"to search for billions of things,

176
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:43,877
"has itself long been
searching for something.

177
00:06:45,127 --> 00:06:46,371
And here it is."

178
00:06:47,116 --> 00:06:48,992
Okay, then I turn and gesture.

179
00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:54,120
"The Box Three.

180
00:06:54,752 --> 00:06:56,793
Signature Edition."

181
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:00,215
Then I come back to the podium.

182
00:07:01,516 --> 00:07:03,139
"I put my name on this,

183
00:07:03,335 --> 00:07:05,835
"because I personally stand behind

184
00:07:05,836 --> 00:07:07,432
"the new SAS-slash

185
00:07:07,457 --> 00:07:10,689
SSD-slash-NVMe
drive bays,

186
00:07:10,836 --> 00:07:13,042
"the 24-core processors.

187
00:07:13,043 --> 00:07:16,414
"I stand behind the ECC DDR4

188
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:18,485
SD-RAM
LR-DIMMs

189
00:07:18,586 --> 00:07:21,218
"and their exceptional reliability.

190
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:23,492
Will you stand with me?"

191
00:07:35,586 --> 00:07:37,501
About the spotlight, should it be wider?

192
00:07:37,502 --> 00:07:39,084
- I had the same thought.
- As did I.

193
00:07:39,085 --> 00:07:40,918
- I can speak with the technical team.
- Please.

194
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,751
Any word from our mole at Pied Piper?

195
00:07:43,752 --> 00:07:45,585
I'm confident that if there
were anything to report,

196
00:07:45,586 --> 00:07:47,084
we'd have heard about it by now, sir.

197
00:07:47,442 --> 00:07:48,501
Alright!

198
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:51,042
I'm off to Jackson Hole for a
couple of days to clear my mind,

199
00:07:51,043 --> 00:07:52,334
and center myself.

200
00:07:52,335 --> 00:07:54,835
I'll be off the grid. Not to
be disturbed for any reason.

201
00:07:54,836 --> 00:07:56,293
- Understood?
- Absolutely.

202
00:07:56,294 --> 00:07:58,427
Is there anything else you'd
like us to take care of? Oh.

203
00:07:58,452 --> 00:08:00,201
Oh. The bear is sticky with honey.

204
00:08:00,752 --> 00:08:01,708
See ya soon.

205
00:08:07,646 --> 00:08:10,572
"The bear is sticky with honey."

206
00:08:11,168 --> 00:08:12,454
What does he mean by that?

207
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:13,973
I don't know.

208
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,110
Hello, Stallions.

209
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,495
You continue to be the best of the best.

210
00:08:20,377 --> 00:08:21,599
I commend you.

211
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:23,793
And then there's you.

212
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,001
The anti-Stallion.

213
00:08:25,002 --> 00:08:27,335
Move your hand off your fucking mouse, now.

214
00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:35,001
And I was going to take you
to see BattleBots live with me,

215
00:08:35,002 --> 00:08:37,043
but no longer... "friend."

216
00:08:37,335 --> 00:08:38,962
Now who looks stupid?

217
00:08:40,711 --> 00:08:42,334
Yeah, so, um...

218
00:08:42,335 --> 00:08:45,793
our new developers just
agreed to our terms,

219
00:08:45,794 --> 00:08:48,042
and are now officially on board.

220
00:08:48,043 --> 00:08:50,886
Richard is a master at getting consent.

221
00:08:51,294 --> 00:08:53,334
That's great news, guys.

222
00:08:53,335 --> 00:08:54,668
Eight new partners.

223
00:08:54,669 --> 00:08:57,877
Yeah! Actually, we're
calling them the OctoPipers.

224
00:09:01,669 --> 00:09:03,543
Uh, until a better name comes along.

225
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:05,668
Just wanted to give that
one its day in court.

226
00:09:05,669 --> 00:09:08,126
Well, we have some more
good news for you, Richard.

227
00:09:08,127 --> 00:09:09,127
You remember last year,

228
00:09:09,128 --> 00:09:11,042
Laurie and I funded K-Hole Games?

229
00:09:11,043 --> 00:09:13,376
Largest independent gaming
company in the Valley?

230
00:09:13,377 --> 00:09:15,376
Uh, yeah, of course!

231
00:09:15,377 --> 00:09:18,042
Um, actually, now that
you... you bring them up,

232
00:09:18,043 --> 00:09:19,835
I-I didn't want to be too forward,

233
00:09:19,836 --> 00:09:21,710
but I was hoping that one day,

234
00:09:21,711 --> 00:09:24,543
we could talk to them
about joining our 'net.

235
00:09:24,544 --> 00:09:26,835
Well, what if I told you that day is today?

236
00:09:26,836 --> 00:09:27,836
What?

237
00:09:27,837 --> 00:09:30,209
In addition to being business associates,

238
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,668
the CEO and I take medically prescribed

239
00:09:32,669 --> 00:09:34,543
and supervised MDMA together.

240
00:09:34,794 --> 00:09:37,084
I'm taking it for severe
post-partum depression.

241
00:09:37,085 --> 00:09:39,297
I do not know why he is taking it.

242
00:09:39,544 --> 00:09:41,751
Regardless, when I saw him yesterday,

243
00:09:41,752 --> 00:09:45,543
he was quite euphoric about
speaking to you regarding a deal.

244
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:47,209
K-Hole? The creators of the game

245
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:49,751
"Undead Sex Offender"?
They're... they're huge.

246
00:09:49,752 --> 00:09:53,418
Yeah! Yeah, partnering with a
company of that size this early

247
00:09:53,419 --> 00:09:54,917
would put us months ahead.

248
00:09:54,918 --> 00:09:56,927
This is not a done deal.

249
00:09:57,127 --> 00:10:00,126
K-Hole is protective of its brand.

250
00:10:00,127 --> 00:10:01,585
They will want to speak to you

251
00:10:01,586 --> 00:10:03,334
regarding who else you are dealing with.

252
00:10:03,335 --> 00:10:05,334
Okay, right, well, um...

253
00:10:05,752 --> 00:10:07,293
why don't I just bring the OctoPipers?

254
00:10:07,294 --> 00:10:10,376
New name to come, though it's
pretty popular around here.

255
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:13,484
Uh, they can talk to K-Hole.

256
00:10:13,836 --> 00:10:15,737
Tell them why they joined.

257
00:10:15,877 --> 00:10:18,159
Allowing you to speak less?

258
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:20,626
Good strategy. Alright.

259
00:10:20,627 --> 00:10:22,794
K-Hole will be expecting
you this afternoon.

260
00:10:24,043 --> 00:10:25,377
Knock 'em dead, Richard.

261
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,794
Whatever you are doing, stop it now.

262
00:10:31,294 --> 00:10:34,298
Um, yeah. We're just... high-fiving.

263
00:10:34,579 --> 00:10:35,626
Bye.

264
00:10:35,627 --> 00:10:37,126
K-Hole. I can't believe it!

265
00:10:37,127 --> 00:10:39,167
I'm bursting. I'm bursting!

266
00:10:39,168 --> 00:10:41,209
Um, here, I printed driving directions.

267
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,959
Oh, it's okay, I got my phone.

268
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,126
Well, I have marked available
bathrooms along the route.

269
00:10:49,877 --> 00:10:51,543
Okay, here we go.

270
00:10:51,544 --> 00:10:54,724
Richard, you never return my calls.

271
00:10:54,897 --> 00:10:57,126
You mean the hundreds
of voicemails you've left

272
00:10:57,127 --> 00:11:00,366
where you just called me a
terrible CEO with no dick?

273
00:11:00,669 --> 00:11:02,751
Yes! You're talking to other companies.

274
00:11:02,752 --> 00:11:05,251
That is not public information.

275
00:11:05,252 --> 00:11:07,376
I'm a part owner in Pied Piper.

276
00:11:07,377 --> 00:11:10,293
You need to make a deal with my companies.

277
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:12,835
You mean your incubator's
spurious knock-offs

278
00:11:12,836 --> 00:11:15,042
of legitimate American businesses?

279
00:11:15,043 --> 00:11:18,334
"New Expedia," "New
Snapchat," "New Zillow"?

280
00:11:18,335 --> 00:11:20,170
But they're for Chinese market.

281
00:11:20,752 --> 00:11:23,001
It's a very sophisticated strategy.

282
00:11:23,185 --> 00:11:25,167
Okay, look, taking existing companies

283
00:11:25,168 --> 00:11:28,543
and just calling them "new"
isn't sophisticated. That's theft.

284
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,192
You make a new Internet.

285
00:11:32,294 --> 00:11:33,626
That is different.

286
00:11:33,627 --> 00:11:35,293
I... Look, we're not gonna make any deals

287
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:36,980
with any of your companies, okay?

288
00:11:40,836 --> 00:11:41,985
Don't pick up.

289
00:11:45,002 --> 00:11:46,995
Richard, hello.

290
00:11:47,334 --> 00:11:48,542
It's Jian-Yang.

291
00:11:48,669 --> 00:11:51,547
You are a shitty CEO.

292
00:11:53,877 --> 00:11:56,936
As long as I own 10% of Pied Piper,

293
00:11:57,627 --> 00:11:59,251
I will make chaos.

294
00:12:00,013 --> 00:12:01,059
Okay.

295
00:12:02,502 --> 00:12:03,959
I thought you hated that car.

296
00:12:04,343 --> 00:12:06,501
Aviato car smells like a dead pig.

297
00:12:06,502 --> 00:12:09,877
You're aware that Russ Hanneman
urinated in that car, no?

298
00:12:11,168 --> 00:12:12,209
This car?

299
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,210
Mm-hmm.

300
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:17,819
Uh...

301
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,984
- are you just gonna leave it here?
- Yes.

302
00:12:19,985 --> 00:12:20,951
Well...

303
00:12:22,256 --> 00:12:23,484
looks like I have a reason to find

304
00:12:23,485 --> 00:12:25,270
Pied Piper's official towing company.

305
00:12:25,295 --> 00:12:26,544
I'm gonna get some bids.

306
00:12:26,569 --> 00:12:27,800
Yeah, while you're at it,

307
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,175
see if you can find someone
to bash that guy's face in.

308
00:12:30,772 --> 00:12:33,300
Uh, I-I can do some research.

309
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:41,395
Maybe turn your phone
off during the meeting.

310
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:43,341
You're a shitty CEO!

311
00:12:49,426 --> 00:12:51,467
Thanks again,
Colin, for having us.

312
00:12:51,468 --> 00:12:53,216
Uh, the fact that a company like yours

313
00:12:53,217 --> 00:12:55,841
with such a pristine reputation
it sitting down with us

314
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:57,633
is, honestly, incredibly flattering.

315
00:12:57,779 --> 00:12:58,799
It's cool.

316
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,258
Ooh, wow.

317
00:13:00,615 --> 00:13:02,717
- That'll be a closed casket.
- Yeah.

318
00:13:02,718 --> 00:13:04,216
Alright, well, we thought the best way

319
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:05,176
to introduce the Pipernet

320
00:13:05,177 --> 00:13:07,341
would be through the eight developers

321
00:13:07,342 --> 00:13:08,552
that have already signed on.

322
00:13:08,577 --> 00:13:10,634
Who we are calling the OctoPipers.

323
00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:13,069
That's dumb.

324
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:16,152
Um, anyway, let's
introduce you to the group.

325
00:13:16,153 --> 00:13:18,945
Um, we've got a great analytics tool

326
00:13:18,946 --> 00:13:20,736
by a former Google guru.

327
00:13:20,737 --> 00:13:22,569
- Wish I'd have thought of that one.
- Cool.

328
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,319
Uh, music streaming with
an AI taste predictor

329
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,766
that is off the charts.

330
00:13:26,987 --> 00:13:27,987
Good space.

331
00:13:27,988 --> 00:13:30,486
Yes, and this handsome devil over here,

332
00:13:30,487 --> 00:13:32,959
is creating a very
promising gay dating site.

333
00:13:33,171 --> 00:13:34,178
That's cool.

334
00:13:34,203 --> 00:13:36,152
Yeah, but don't worry,
he's not snobby about it.

335
00:13:36,153 --> 00:13:37,444
He's actually pretty boring.

336
00:13:37,445 --> 00:13:39,319
I don't mean that as an
insult. Those are his words.

337
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,528
Long-term relationship.
Doesn't smoke, doesn't drink.

338
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,841
And him and his man go
to church every Sunday.

339
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:44,993
So...

340
00:13:45,862 --> 00:13:47,766
loves Bible studies, right?

341
00:13:48,024 --> 00:13:50,398
Just a straight-up boring, ordinary guy,

342
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,720
but obviously not straight.

343
00:13:52,035 --> 00:13:55,192
Very gay, and also a Christian, right?

344
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,273
Okay, so, that went well.

345
00:13:58,274 --> 00:14:00,702
It started out a little weird,
but things really picked up...

346
00:14:00,727 --> 00:14:01,678
Why did you do that?

347
00:14:01,703 --> 00:14:03,565
- Why did you say that?
- Say what?

348
00:14:03,566 --> 00:14:05,565
Richard, you just told a
room full of tech people

349
00:14:05,566 --> 00:14:06,898
that I'm a Christian.

350
00:14:07,349 --> 00:14:08,371
Oh.

351
00:14:08,396 --> 00:14:10,273
Okay, but... But you are, aren't you?

352
00:14:10,274 --> 00:14:12,607
Yes, but I told you that in confidence.

353
00:14:12,608 --> 00:14:14,066
I said "between you and me."

354
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,527
I'm not openly Christian.

355
00:14:17,254 --> 00:14:18,753
Thanks a lot, man.

356
00:14:18,753 --> 00:14:19,794
You just outed me.

357
00:14:19,795 --> 00:14:21,684
Oh, I'm sorry, Deedee. I didn't...

358
00:14:22,253 --> 00:14:25,252
Okay, um, should we hug?

359
00:14:25,253 --> 00:14:27,128
I can not make it weird this time.

360
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,836
I'm... I'm sorry, Richard.

361
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:33,669
You know that my default position

362
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,793
is blind support of whatever you do, but...

363
00:14:36,753 --> 00:14:38,127
this was not your best moment.

364
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:40,252
Guys, it can't be that
big of a deal, right?

365
00:14:40,253 --> 00:14:41,502
Why should it be?

366
00:14:41,503 --> 00:14:43,011
America loves Christians.

367
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,243
Muslims are the enemy.

368
00:14:44,378 --> 00:14:46,127
Well, that's true in most of America,

369
00:14:46,128 --> 00:14:48,490
but not in Silicon Valley, sadly.

370
00:14:48,712 --> 00:14:51,544
"Sadly"? You can be openly polyamorous.

371
00:14:51,545 --> 00:14:53,669
And people here will call you brave.

372
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:56,961
You can put micro-doses
of LSD in your cereal,

373
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:58,669
and... and people will call you a pioneer.

374
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:02,293
But the one thing you
cannot be is a Christian.

375
00:15:02,294 --> 00:15:04,335
I find their theology to be illegitimate,

376
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:06,585
and it's clear that they are the source

377
00:15:06,586 --> 00:15:08,627
of the majority of the world's problems.

378
00:15:08,628 --> 00:15:10,369
But, fuck, Richard, even I wouldn't just...

379
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:12,669
out a Christian like that.

380
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:14,460
Yeah, it was kinda fucked up.

381
00:15:15,191 --> 00:15:16,727
Cool man, thanks.

382
00:15:17,545 --> 00:15:20,210
Hey, I thought
he wasn't supposed to chime in.

383
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:21,675
Yeah, he's not, but...

384
00:15:23,211 --> 00:15:25,043
based on its merits, I'll allow that one.

385
00:15:25,044 --> 00:15:27,419
Guys, come on.

386
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,743
It can't be that bad.

387
00:15:28,744 --> 00:15:29,850
Richard!

388
00:15:30,035 --> 00:15:32,285
What the fuck did you do over there?

389
00:15:32,286 --> 00:15:35,577
So I just got off the phone
with Colin over at K-Hole,

390
00:15:35,578 --> 00:15:37,118
and while he loves your tech,

391
00:15:37,119 --> 00:15:38,909
he's considering blowing up the deal.

392
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:39,910
What?

393
00:15:39,911 --> 00:15:41,909
Just because one of my CEOs is Christian?

394
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,743
It freaks people out in the Valley!

395
00:15:43,744 --> 00:15:46,361
Okay, so what do you want me to do, Monica?

396
00:15:46,386 --> 00:15:48,713
You want me to drop Deedee
just because he's Christian?

397
00:15:48,828 --> 00:15:50,952
The company's not Christian. It's gay...

398
00:15:51,728 --> 00:15:52,935
which is fine, right?

399
00:15:52,936 --> 00:15:54,810
Yeah! No, that... That plays great.

400
00:15:54,811 --> 00:15:57,769
Look, cutting all ties
to Deedee and FirstSight

401
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:00,166
will definitely send a
strong message to Colin.

402
00:16:00,311 --> 00:16:01,643
And it might be the only way.

403
00:16:01,644 --> 00:16:04,143
Like killing somebody to
prove you're not a narc,

404
00:16:04,144 --> 00:16:06,143
or showing a john your genitals

405
00:16:06,144 --> 00:16:08,019
to prove you're a
legitimate male prostitute

406
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,185
and not an undercover cop.

407
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,715
- What?
- Because cops aren't allowed to do that.

408
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:13,351
And worst case scenario,

409
00:16:13,352 --> 00:16:15,185
the john walks off with a free peek.

410
00:16:15,186 --> 00:16:17,644
Oh, that's the towing company. Excuse me.

411
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,121
Forget it.

412
00:16:20,122 --> 00:16:21,663
Monica, I'm not doing it.

413
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,871
I mean, I'm not dropping him.

414
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,704
Alright. Fine.

415
00:16:25,706 --> 00:16:27,622
Fine. I-I will call Colin,

416
00:16:27,623 --> 00:16:29,413
and try and smooth things over for you,

417
00:16:29,414 --> 00:16:31,121
but you need to handle Deedee.

418
00:16:31,122 --> 00:16:33,497
Okay, apologize for outing him, of course,

419
00:16:33,498 --> 00:16:36,330
but you need to make sure
he keeps quiet about this.

420
00:16:36,331 --> 00:16:38,371
Alright, 'cause it's not
just about losing K-Hole,

421
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,747
it's way worse than that.

422
00:16:39,905 --> 00:16:40,996
Let's put it this way.

423
00:16:40,997 --> 00:16:42,996
Would you want to go from being a rock band

424
00:16:42,997 --> 00:16:46,581
to being... a Christian rock band?

425
00:16:47,748 --> 00:16:48,755
Oh, shit.

426
00:16:49,255 --> 00:16:52,001
"The bear is sticky with honey."

427
00:16:52,621 --> 00:16:54,330
Those were his exact words.

428
00:16:54,331 --> 00:16:55,538
But what does that mean?

429
00:16:55,539 --> 00:16:57,246
Well, Gavin speaks in parables.

430
00:16:57,247 --> 00:16:59,284
I think what Gavin is saying is...

431
00:16:59,914 --> 00:17:01,455
"consider the bear."

432
00:17:01,751 --> 00:17:03,926
And all this pizazz is like the honey.

433
00:17:04,213 --> 00:17:05,781
And it's become too sticky.

434
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:07,875
There's too much of it. It's all over him.

435
00:17:07,876 --> 00:17:10,479
Incorrect. No, see, the
whole launch is the bear,

436
00:17:10,793 --> 00:17:12,541
and the honey is the pizazz.

437
00:17:12,542 --> 00:17:14,180
The bear needs more pizazz.

438
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,846
The bear is ravenous for pizazz.

439
00:17:16,847 --> 00:17:18,179
You don't speak for Gavin.

440
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,605
I don't need to. This is the word of Gavin.

441
00:17:20,605 --> 00:17:22,045
Alright, forget it.

442
00:17:22,194 --> 00:17:24,104
- You do it your way, I'll do it mine.
- Okay, fine.

443
00:17:24,257 --> 00:17:26,355
Gonna show you. Make
it clear for all of you.

444
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,372
Okay, follow me.

445
00:17:27,466 --> 00:17:29,673
Well, congratulations on becoming

446
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:31,711
Pied Piper's official towing company.

447
00:17:31,841 --> 00:17:33,290
Uh-huh, yeah, great.

448
00:17:33,507 --> 00:17:34,631
So should I bill this to you,

449
00:17:34,632 --> 00:17:37,047
or is Mr. Bighetti gonna take care of it?

450
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,880
"Bighetti"? It's registered under his name.

451
00:17:39,882 --> 00:17:40,992
I'm sorry. Can I...?

452
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,770
Anyway, it was a mistake.

453
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,102
I'm sorry I outed you.

454
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:51,728
I just wish we could go back to normal.

455
00:17:51,729 --> 00:17:54,102
You know, just like, how things were.

456
00:17:54,103 --> 00:17:55,691
A CEO and a gay CEO.

457
00:17:55,918 --> 00:17:57,834
I don't even know what
normal is anymore, Richard.

458
00:17:57,896 --> 00:18:00,020
It's been such a crazy 24 hours, you know?

459
00:18:00,021 --> 00:18:02,415
Gossip travels so fast in the Valley.

460
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:04,495
I'll be lucky if my parents
ever talk to me again.

461
00:18:04,495 --> 00:18:05,796
Your parents aren't Christian?

462
00:18:06,037 --> 00:18:07,286
I'm from Palo Alto.

463
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:09,662
You know, my dad says my
lifestyle makes him sick.

464
00:18:10,287 --> 00:18:11,787
He just wants his gay son back.

465
00:18:11,788 --> 00:18:13,912
And he's okay with the gay part?

466
00:18:13,913 --> 00:18:15,427
- He's gay.
- Oh.

467
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,759
But the crazy part is,

468
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,168
when I finally got home and I got in bed,

469
00:18:19,552 --> 00:18:22,009
I had the soundest sleep I've had in years.

470
00:18:22,328 --> 00:18:25,002
- Exhaustion.
- No! Relief, Richard.

471
00:18:25,002 --> 00:18:26,502
I'm out, okay?

472
00:18:26,503 --> 00:18:27,710
My nightmare's over.

473
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:29,799
I don't ever have to go
back in the closet again,

474
00:18:29,824 --> 00:18:32,169
and I've got you to thank for it.

475
00:18:34,169 --> 00:18:35,169
Check it out.

476
00:18:35,193 --> 00:18:36,585
_

477
00:18:36,586 --> 00:18:38,502
Oh, oh, oh.

478
00:18:38,503 --> 00:18:39,558
You like it?

479
00:18:39,753 --> 00:18:42,919
It's good. I guess... maybe
it's just a little busy?

480
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,960
Like, um, there's one word too many.

481
00:18:44,961 --> 00:18:47,335
One word? Well, I like the gay part.

482
00:18:47,336 --> 00:18:48,835
If anything, it could be more gay.

483
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,543
You should gay it up,

484
00:18:50,544 --> 00:18:52,618
and then, I like the "proud" part.

485
00:18:52,961 --> 00:18:54,549
It's just the...

486
00:18:54,972 --> 00:18:56,001
Christian part.

487
00:18:56,347 --> 00:18:58,418
Look, Richard, this is great,

488
00:18:58,419 --> 00:19:01,502
because now I can be gay and a Christian.

489
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,731
Or just be gay!

490
00:19:03,294 --> 00:19:05,210
You know, you could be a... a twink.

491
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:06,377
A bear, an otter.

492
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:08,418
A circuit queen, a chub, a pup.

493
00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:10,043
A gipster, a daddy chaser,

494
00:19:10,044 --> 00:19:11,502
a leatherman, a lady boy.

495
00:19:11,503 --> 00:19:12,752
You could be a Donald Duck,

496
00:19:12,753 --> 00:19:14,794
which is a gay guy who
got kicked out of the Navy.

497
00:19:14,795 --> 00:19:16,001
Yeah, I... I know what it is.

498
00:19:16,002 --> 00:19:17,335
How do you know so many gay things?

499
00:19:17,646 --> 00:19:19,544
I worked with a guy.

500
00:19:21,211 --> 00:19:22,204
Just...

501
00:19:22,753 --> 00:19:23,915
don't be a Christian.

502
00:19:24,278 --> 00:19:25,451
Wow.

503
00:19:26,044 --> 00:19:27,210
After all you put me through,

504
00:19:27,211 --> 00:19:28,919
it turns out, you're biased too.

505
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,477
No! No, no, no! I'm not!

506
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,691
I swear to you I'm not. I'm chill AF.

507
00:19:33,086 --> 00:19:34,293
It's just everybody else.

508
00:19:34,294 --> 00:19:37,585
Look, if you go Christian,
I lose K-Hole games.

509
00:19:37,586 --> 00:19:39,960
I cannot let that happen. I know it sucks.

510
00:19:39,961 --> 00:19:41,710
It's shitty, but it's the truth.

511
00:19:41,711 --> 00:19:43,508
I'm gonna make things
easy for you, Richard.

512
00:19:44,298 --> 00:19:45,379
I'm out.

513
00:19:46,471 --> 00:19:48,082
- Of the closet?
- No!

514
00:19:48,268 --> 00:19:49,702
The new Internet!

515
00:19:50,264 --> 00:19:52,085
The Internet you said was
gonna be... What was it?

516
00:19:52,086 --> 00:19:54,627
"The first truly free and open Internet."

517
00:19:54,628 --> 00:19:55,919
Open for everyone.

518
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,293
Whatever happened to that, huh?

519
00:19:58,753 --> 00:19:59,948
Nice place.

520
00:20:00,148 --> 00:20:01,564
Oh, thanks, yeah.

521
00:20:01,753 --> 00:20:03,798
Oh, wow! That's a nice touch.

522
00:20:04,086 --> 00:20:05,335
Yeah, thanks!

523
00:20:05,336 --> 00:20:07,919
The Monterey Bay Aquarium
was testing their sonar,

524
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,054
and found this thing, like,
two miles under the ocean.

525
00:20:11,262 --> 00:20:13,293
And I figure, Erlich
and I already bought it,

526
00:20:13,294 --> 00:20:14,835
so I might as well hold onto it.

527
00:20:14,836 --> 00:20:16,752
Plus, it weighs like 8,000 pounds,

528
00:20:16,753 --> 00:20:18,460
so I couldn't move it if I wanted to.

529
00:20:18,461 --> 00:20:20,626
Well, and it also kinda
works as your mascot.

530
00:20:20,795 --> 00:20:22,166
Right? 'Cause of your name?

531
00:20:22,294 --> 00:20:24,002
Oh, yeah, 'cause "Nelson."

532
00:20:24,853 --> 00:20:26,776
Oh, I meant because it's a big head.

533
00:20:28,005 --> 00:20:29,739
I guess that works, too.

534
00:20:30,753 --> 00:20:31,963
So, what's up, man?

535
00:20:32,086 --> 00:20:34,377
Um, well, I wanted to ask you...

536
00:20:34,378 --> 00:20:36,051
Oh! Big Head!

537
00:20:36,378 --> 00:20:38,165
Now I get it.

538
00:20:38,419 --> 00:20:40,293
Sorry. Is... is it possible

539
00:20:40,294 --> 00:20:42,960
that the general partnership
that you formed with Erlich

540
00:20:42,961 --> 00:20:44,251
is still in effect?

541
00:20:44,252 --> 00:20:45,817
Oh. No way.

542
00:20:46,127 --> 00:20:47,903
You definitely dissolved it?

543
00:20:47,903 --> 00:20:49,319
Yeah, my dad insisted.

544
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,235
I remember he filled out
this whole form for me,

545
00:20:52,236 --> 00:20:53,360
and made me sign it,

546
00:20:53,361 --> 00:20:54,819
mail it in and everything.

547
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,902
Yeah, 'cause I... I remember
I had the paperwork in one hand,

548
00:20:57,903 --> 00:21:00,103
and the menu for Mr. Chow's in the other.

549
00:21:00,128 --> 00:21:01,170
And then...

550
00:21:13,653 --> 00:21:15,027
Oh, no way!

551
00:21:15,646 --> 00:21:16,652
Still have the paperwork.

552
00:21:16,653 --> 00:21:18,777
Guess I must have sent the menu.

553
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:21,027
Big Head, this is great news.

554
00:21:21,028 --> 00:21:22,193
Gavin?

555
00:21:22,194 --> 00:21:23,861
I think you're really
going to love the changes

556
00:21:23,862 --> 00:21:25,319
that my team has made to the presentation.

557
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,637
I think you might like ours even better.

558
00:21:28,069 --> 00:21:29,611
Sorry, what changes?

559
00:21:29,612 --> 00:21:30,861
We are presenting two paths,

560
00:21:30,862 --> 00:21:33,110
and you alone will decide
which one we walk, Gavin.

561
00:21:33,111 --> 00:21:34,611
What the fuck are you talking about?

562
00:21:34,612 --> 00:21:36,444
I thought the presentation
was fine as it is.

563
00:21:37,001 --> 00:21:38,777
- Wait. What?
- You did?

564
00:21:38,968 --> 00:21:40,218
Goddammit!

565
00:21:40,737 --> 00:21:42,027
Why is this still here?

566
00:21:42,028 --> 00:21:43,861
I said it was too sticky.

567
00:21:43,862 --> 00:21:46,027
Don't you listen to anything I say?

568
00:21:47,111 --> 00:21:49,110
- The bear...
- Sticky with honey.

569
00:21:49,587 --> 00:21:50,902
So what did you change?

570
00:21:51,134 --> 00:21:52,485
Uh, the spotlight.

571
00:21:52,486 --> 00:21:54,861
Yes! We're making it
wider just like you asked.

572
00:21:54,979 --> 00:21:56,063
Good.

573
00:21:56,162 --> 00:21:58,228
You know what? Let's show
you to your dressing room.

574
00:21:58,229 --> 00:21:59,936
Yeah. And whenever you're
ready, you let us know,

575
00:21:59,937 --> 00:22:01,374
we'll show you that spotlight, huh?

576
00:22:01,428 --> 00:22:03,395
- You're gonna love it.
- We did it!

577
00:22:03,396 --> 00:22:05,727
We had to fly him in from
Tucson, but we got the bear.

578
00:22:10,281 --> 00:22:12,186
Gavin hates the bear. You failed!

579
00:22:12,453 --> 00:22:14,040
Put everything back the way it was.

580
00:22:14,244 --> 00:22:15,728
And widen the spotlight!

581
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:17,962
Guess what, asshole.

582
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:19,869
Leon told me he wanted your ticket,

583
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:22,912
'cause he wants to go
see BattleBots with me.

584
00:22:24,203 --> 00:22:26,494
But then he remembered he
actually had plans that night

585
00:22:26,495 --> 00:22:28,827
with a bunch of people,
doesn't know what they're doing,

586
00:22:28,828 --> 00:22:29,869
their plans are sort of fluid,

587
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,911
plus, it's like friends from his old work,

588
00:22:31,912 --> 00:22:33,703
so it'd be weird if I hung out with them.

589
00:22:34,745 --> 00:22:35,856
Anyway...

590
00:22:36,244 --> 00:22:39,535
looks like you and I are
going to see BattleBots.

591
00:22:39,536 --> 00:22:40,952
You're going to hang out with me,

592
00:22:40,953 --> 00:22:42,744
and have fun, whether you like it or not.

593
00:22:42,745 --> 00:22:45,017
And what goes best with BattleBots?

594
00:22:45,745 --> 00:22:47,474
That's right. Chicken wings.

595
00:22:47,994 --> 00:22:51,862
That's why you get a sweet $50
gift card to Dave & Buster's.

596
00:22:52,575 --> 00:22:54,869
Serves you right for fucking us over.

597
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,244
Wash your fucking hair.

598
00:22:57,953 --> 00:23:00,272
And you know what happens
when I get drunk, Jeff?

599
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:02,826
I get so sincere.

600
00:23:03,286 --> 00:23:04,612
It's really awkward.

601
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:06,324
Fuck you, Jeff.

602
00:23:06,495 --> 00:23:07,869
Oh, um, can you drive?

603
00:23:10,102 --> 00:23:12,452
Well, I spoke to La Flamme,

604
00:23:12,453 --> 00:23:13,474
and it's official.

605
00:23:13,662 --> 00:23:16,306
Big Head is still legally
Erlich's next of kin.

606
00:23:16,411 --> 00:23:18,449
So Jian-Yang's whole gambit was for naught.

607
00:23:19,411 --> 00:23:20,619
Wow, really?

608
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:23,327
Big Head owns Erlich's
house, and 10% of Pied Piper.

609
00:23:23,328 --> 00:23:26,035
I called the sheriff and
started eviction proceedings.

610
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,666
We're gonna get everything back.

611
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:31,667
Oh, also, the, uh, OctoPipers
are arriving for the meeting.

612
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:34,165
It's a good thing that
FirstSight dropped out, right?

613
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:35,916
'Cause we're back down to eight developers,

614
00:23:35,917 --> 00:23:37,415
so you can keep that name.

615
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,588
Actually, uh, no, we can't.

616
00:23:41,059 --> 00:23:42,169
Wait, what?

617
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:44,680
- I'm glad this worked out.
- Yeah.

618
00:23:44,834 --> 00:23:46,162
Thanks for dropping FirstSight.

619
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:48,582
Jesus, my board would
have nailed me to a cross.

620
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:51,863
Well, I think we're just about
ready to get going here, uh...

621
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:53,499
Oh. Hey!

622
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,487
Oh, good, there he is.
What's he doing here?

623
00:23:55,629 --> 00:23:59,557
He is here because I asked him to be.

624
00:24:00,143 --> 00:24:02,188
I want him to be one of our developers.

625
00:24:02,188 --> 00:24:04,170
What? No! Fuck that guy!

626
00:24:04,374 --> 00:24:05,595
Hey, man, how's it goin'?

627
00:24:05,981 --> 00:24:07,397
- Richard.
- Deedee.

628
00:24:07,398 --> 00:24:08,689
- Can I talk to you?
- Yeah!

629
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,137
No, no, no. Actually, look!

630
00:24:10,356 --> 00:24:11,716
Look, guys, I...

631
00:24:12,189 --> 00:24:14,855
I asked you to be a part of this

632
00:24:14,856 --> 00:24:18,087
because I thought you were
willing to take a chance

633
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:19,745
on my idea.

634
00:24:19,745 --> 00:24:21,619
An entirely new Internet.

635
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,577
An Internet that is everything

636
00:24:23,578 --> 00:24:26,263
the old Internet is
supposed to be, but isn't.

637
00:24:26,411 --> 00:24:28,744
Truly free and truly open.

638
00:24:28,745 --> 00:24:30,327
Well, I'm sorry, gang.

639
00:24:30,907 --> 00:24:33,278
Truly open means "open to everyone."

640
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:36,410
No matter how repugnant their views are.

641
00:24:36,411 --> 00:24:38,327
How ignorant or stupid,

642
00:24:38,328 --> 00:24:40,535
or, to be honest, totally fucking wrong.

643
00:24:40,536 --> 00:24:42,493
And, look, who are we to judge, right?

644
00:24:42,494 --> 00:24:43,951
There's some people out there that believe

645
00:24:43,952 --> 00:24:45,951
that we're living in a computer simulation.

646
00:24:45,952 --> 00:24:47,994
Well, that is supported by the evidence.

647
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:50,077
What?

648
00:24:50,078 --> 00:24:52,243
Uh, it's basic probability theory.

649
00:24:52,244 --> 00:24:54,586
Right, uh, Richard, can I
talk to you for just a sec?

650
00:24:54,611 --> 00:24:55,664
Yes, of course.

651
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,201
Uh, that's bullshit actually.

652
00:24:59,202 --> 00:25:00,285
It's been disproven.

653
00:25:00,286 --> 00:25:01,619
But why does that even matter?

654
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,869
In a few years, we'll
all be working for robots.

655
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,327
No, that's stupid.

656
00:25:05,328 --> 00:25:06,660
The robots will be working for us.

657
00:25:06,661 --> 00:25:08,493
Robots? Who gives a fuck about robots?

658
00:25:08,494 --> 00:25:10,910
It's the artificial super intelligence
we should be worried about.

659
00:25:10,911 --> 00:25:12,493
Exactly, and that's why we have to stop it.

660
00:25:12,494 --> 00:25:14,660
Stop it? No, that's the
us I'm talking about.

661
00:25:14,661 --> 00:25:16,535
We have to bring it into existence.

662
00:25:16,536 --> 00:25:19,410
Otherwise, it'll find out who didn't
believe in it, and punish them.

663
00:25:19,411 --> 00:25:21,029
- Right.
- Guys, I was wrong.

664
00:25:21,661 --> 00:25:23,860
Um, Deedee is...

665
00:25:24,202 --> 00:25:27,410
not in. He's actually very much out.

666
00:25:27,411 --> 00:25:28,456
So...

667
00:25:28,745 --> 00:25:30,588
do-over on the whole speech.

668
00:25:31,286 --> 00:25:32,660
Fuck that guy!

669
00:25:32,661 --> 00:25:34,035
Christians suck!

670
00:25:34,036 --> 00:25:36,869
And, uh, here's a good side effect though.

671
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,911
Uh, we all get to keep the name OctoPipers.

672
00:25:41,637 --> 00:25:44,365
You know what? Why don't
we just take a quick five?

673
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,744
And then, we'll BRB,

674
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:48,452
and then, go teams.

675
00:25:48,453 --> 00:25:50,453
So just... let's have a...

676
00:25:54,077 --> 00:25:55,577
What just happened?

677
00:25:55,578 --> 00:25:56,857
Deedee's out?

678
00:25:57,578 --> 00:25:59,452
Yeah, well, he said

679
00:25:59,453 --> 00:26:01,910
that right after he bailed on us,

680
00:26:01,911 --> 00:26:05,076
he went out and made a
deal with our competitor.

681
00:26:05,354 --> 00:26:09,077
- But we don't have any competitors.
- Richard?

682
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:13,201
Fuckin' Jian-Yang.

683
00:26:13,202 --> 00:26:15,410
I'm gonna tear him a new asshole.

684
00:26:15,411 --> 00:26:18,368
It wasn't enough to do New
Snapchat or New Expedia,

685
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:20,243
he had to do New Pied Piper too?

686
00:26:20,244 --> 00:26:21,702
Where did he get our code?

687
00:26:21,703 --> 00:26:23,619
He was always stealing
snacks from the office.

688
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,327
He could've lifted it from anywhere.

689
00:26:25,328 --> 00:26:27,614
I guess that's what happened
to my lavender cheese.

690
00:26:27,745 --> 00:26:29,579
Jian-Yang! Open up!

691
00:26:35,411 --> 00:26:36,744
What the fuck?

692
00:26:36,745 --> 00:26:39,445
Why does every home I've
ever loved get stripped?

693
00:26:40,703 --> 00:26:43,116
Is that Erlich in the bucket?

694
00:26:50,453 --> 00:26:51,619
Uh...

695
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:52,624
"Richard...

696
00:26:52,952 --> 00:26:56,771
"Hello, I went to China
to do new new Internet.

697
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,639
"Thank you. Enjoy your house.

698
00:27:02,202 --> 00:27:03,348
"I love you.

699
00:27:04,093 --> 00:27:05,167
Jian-Yang."

700
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:22,076
I'm here with Pied Piper
CEO Richard Hendricks,

701
00:28:22,077 --> 00:28:24,035
and newly minted COO Jared Dunn.

702
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:26,076
Tell me what your new internet is,

703
00:28:26,077 --> 00:28:28,369
and why Gavin Belson
should be afraid of it.

704
00:28:29,036 --> 00:28:30,745
- Manure?
- Pardon?

705
00:28:32,453 --> 00:28:34,660
Sir, I had no idea
they were this far along.

706
00:28:34,661 --> 00:28:35,703
You must be furious.

707
00:28:36,077 --> 00:28:37,202
That's the thing.

708
00:28:38,161 --> 00:28:39,161
I'm not.

709
00:28:40,369 --> 00:28:42,869
So, we're just giving a random company

710
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:44,951
a bunch of free compute
power on our network?

Fiona.
