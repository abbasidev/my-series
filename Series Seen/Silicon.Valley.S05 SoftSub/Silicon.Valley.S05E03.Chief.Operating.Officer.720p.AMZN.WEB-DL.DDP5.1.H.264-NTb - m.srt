1
00:00:02,778 --> 00:00:05,161
Something's
wrong with your "frunk".

2
00:00:05,486 --> 00:00:06,942
It's all "frucked" up.

3
00:00:09,111 --> 00:00:12,325
I've instituted an operation
to safeguard our interests.

4
00:00:12,394 --> 00:00:14,309
Uh, Gavin Belson's office,
please.

5
00:00:14,416 --> 00:00:15,989
You wanted me
to unite the teams?

6
00:00:16,157 --> 00:00:18,044
They are united against me.

7
00:00:18,137 --> 00:00:21,702
If I'm not inspirational enough
for you, then there's the door.

8
00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:27,297
I'll approve you
as the soul beneficiary

9
00:00:27,366 --> 00:00:30,054
and the official executor
of Mr. Bachman's estate.

10
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,546
This is my incubator now.

11
00:00:31,623 --> 00:00:33,924
You can't just kick us out,
Jian-Yang.

12
00:00:45,874 --> 00:00:46,964
Wait a second.

13
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:49,883
So, the guy who just
kicked me out of my house

14
00:00:49,968 --> 00:00:52,031
now owns 10%
of my company?

15
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,406
Technically, he kicked you
out of his house.

16
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:57,570
And he inherited all
of Mr. Bachman's assets

17
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,703
including his 10%
of Pied Piper.

18
00:01:00,774 --> 00:01:03,242
- By faking his death.
- Allegedly!

19
00:01:03,311 --> 00:01:04,438
Look, Richie.

20
00:01:04,507 --> 00:01:07,156
You didn't actually
lose anything here, okay?

21
00:01:07,225 --> 00:01:09,617
Bachman is
the aggrieved party,

22
00:01:09,707 --> 00:01:11,547
and if he is actually
still alive,

23
00:01:11,616 --> 00:01:13,960
he'll get his 10% back
when he shows up.

24
00:01:14,046 --> 00:01:16,203
In the meantime,
is it really any worse

25
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:18,336
if it belongs
to this Yang guy?

26
00:01:18,405 --> 00:01:19,852
No, I guess not.

27
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,091
So what's your real beef
here then, huh, Richie?

28
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,360
You got something
against him?

29
00:01:23,428 --> 00:01:27,391
You don't have, like,
a bias against Asians, do you?

30
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,172
Richard?
No, I don't.

31
00:01:30,307 --> 00:01:33,000
No, I just don't like being
kicked out of my house.

32
00:01:33,069 --> 00:01:34,297
By a...?

33
00:01:34,366 --> 00:01:35,930
N-Nothing. By no one!

34
00:01:35,999 --> 00:01:37,594
By any race!

35
00:01:37,721 --> 00:01:40,309
Yeah, I'm hearing
something different.

36
00:01:40,889 --> 00:01:42,248
You'd tell me
if you harbored

37
00:01:42,317 --> 00:01:44,842
- nativist feelings, wouldn't you?
- Yes.

38
00:01:46,308 --> 00:01:47,607
Dana?

39
00:01:47,685 --> 00:01:48,952
Oh, hey.

40
00:01:49,915 --> 00:01:50,915
Hey!

41
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,459
Dana, this is
Richard Hendricks.

42
00:01:52,528 --> 00:01:54,498
He's the CEO
of Pied Piper.

43
00:01:54,567 --> 00:01:55,592
And, Richard,

44
00:01:55,661 --> 00:01:58,412
- this is Dana, CEO of Quiver.
- Oh, yeah.

45
00:01:58,533 --> 00:02:01,326
Yeah, I hear you guys are giving
Akami a run for their money.

46
00:02:01,827 --> 00:02:03,319
Oh, yeah.

47
00:02:04,801 --> 00:02:06,595
Dana and I kept
finding ourselves

48
00:02:06,672 --> 00:02:08,975
on the same bathroom
schedule back at Hooli.

49
00:02:09,177 --> 00:02:11,436
You know, men
and their cycles.

50
00:02:15,726 --> 00:02:17,190
You know what?

51
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:19,530
You guys should
get a meal together.

52
00:02:19,964 --> 00:02:21,561
Right? You're...
You're kindred spirits.

53
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,577
You're both CEOs.
You have a lot in common.

54
00:02:23,646 --> 00:02:25,436
Sure, yeah. Maybe. Yep.

55
00:02:25,505 --> 00:02:27,225
Well, Richard, you're free
tomorrow night.

56
00:02:27,308 --> 00:02:28,506
But I'm not.

57
00:02:28,575 --> 00:02:30,694
I have a big party
at my house.

58
00:02:30,858 --> 00:02:32,577
A lot of people
I don't know.

59
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:34,746
So, see ya!

60
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:40,577
What was that?

61
00:02:40,722 --> 00:02:42,702
I don't need you
to make friends for me.

62
00:02:42,771 --> 00:02:44,494
Oh, I just think
you could benefit

63
00:02:44,563 --> 00:02:46,151
from a friendship
with someone like Dana,

64
00:02:46,219 --> 00:02:47,682
who's so much like yourself.

65
00:02:47,773 --> 00:02:50,722
Like me?
You think that guy's like me?

66
00:02:53,071 --> 00:02:54,225
I just thought of something.

67
00:02:54,294 --> 00:02:55,799
Do you guys want
to come to my party?

68
00:02:55,921 --> 00:02:58,226
Dana, that's
so gracious of you.

69
00:02:58,374 --> 00:03:00,188
That would be delightful.

70
00:03:00,415 --> 00:03:02,204
Okay, bye.

71
00:03:02,624 --> 00:03:03,791
Mm-kay.

72
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:07,938
You don't see it?

73
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,516
It's uncanny.

74
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,451
<font color=#FF00FF>*SILICON VALLEY*</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Season 05  Episode 03</font>

75
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,243
Episode Title : <font color=#FFFF00>"Chief Operating Officer"</font>

76
00:03:22,272 --> 00:03:23,916
Look at this.
This is what they're asking

77
00:03:23,984 --> 00:03:26,376
for a one-bedroom
apartment in Menlo Park.

78
00:03:27,331 --> 00:03:28,462
Oh.

79
00:03:28,946 --> 00:03:29,946
What?

80
00:03:30,029 --> 00:03:32,179
Well, I can
comfortably afford

81
00:03:32,304 --> 00:03:34,264
my new one-bedroom apartment.

82
00:03:34,386 --> 00:03:37,257
You and I make
the same amount of money.

83
00:03:38,059 --> 00:03:40,633
I'm just wondering,
what is the difference?

84
00:03:40,702 --> 00:03:43,079
Could it be that
I didn't spend all my money

85
00:03:43,148 --> 00:03:45,610
on an absurdly
over-priced electric car?

86
00:03:45,694 --> 00:03:46,996
Gilfoyle!

87
00:03:47,292 --> 00:03:49,028
So kind of you to join us.

88
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:50,410
You're welcome.

89
00:03:50,543 --> 00:03:52,882
Yeah! Uh, well,
it's, uh, 2:00 PM.

90
00:03:52,951 --> 00:03:54,898
So, fourth day in a row
you missed the stand-up meeting.

91
00:03:54,966 --> 00:03:56,075
Correct.

92
00:03:56,266 --> 00:03:58,098
Maybe you should
hold it later.

93
00:03:58,153 --> 00:04:00,206
Okay, 'cause we
literally moved it

94
00:04:00,275 --> 00:04:02,559
from 9:00 to 11:00
to accommodate you.

95
00:04:02,668 --> 00:04:05,668
So do you mind telling us when you
feel like you can make it in?

96
00:04:05,737 --> 00:04:07,895
Sure. Whenever
you hold the meeting,

97
00:04:08,111 --> 00:04:10,918
- I'll be in an hour after that.
- Okay, well...

98
00:04:11,915 --> 00:04:14,918
What the fuck was that?

99
00:04:15,098 --> 00:04:18,684
Uh, that's the song
"You Suffer" by Napalm Death.

100
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:21,834
Oh, yeah? That's... that's a whole song?
That's like a second.

101
00:04:21,903 --> 00:04:22,997
It's an alert.

102
00:04:23,074 --> 00:04:26,395
Whenever the price of Bitcoin
dips below a certain value,

103
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:28,594
it's no longer
efficient to mine.

104
00:04:28,693 --> 00:04:30,538
When it comes back up,
it is.

105
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,957
So, I need to know
when it breaks that threshold,

106
00:04:33,033 --> 00:04:34,951
so that I can remotely
toggle my rig at home.

107
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,606
Okay. Any idea how often
that might happen?

108
00:04:38,675 --> 00:04:41,057
Bitcoin is very volatile.

109
00:04:41,126 --> 00:04:42,470
So...

110
00:04:42,801 --> 00:04:44,575
That's just so loud.

111
00:04:44,822 --> 00:04:47,371
A lot. Good. Alright, well...

112
00:04:47,824 --> 00:04:49,309
maybe turn it down
or something?

113
00:04:50,246 --> 00:04:51,616
Oh, fuck.

114
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:56,107
What's up? You guys working hard
or hardly working?

115
00:04:57,202 --> 00:04:58,514
'Sup?

116
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:03,439
Hey, buds.
How's it going?

117
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,326
Man, these
Bay Area rents, huh?

118
00:05:06,403 --> 00:05:08,182
High AF.

119
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,293
How's a guy supposed
to live by himself,

120
00:05:10,362 --> 00:05:12,301
or lady, by herself?

121
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,098
Especially on an everyman
coder's salary, you feel me?

122
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,742
Are you offering us a cost
of living raise? Nope!

123
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:19,809
Not at all. Even better.

124
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:21,910
If one of you dudes
is strapped for cash,

125
00:05:21,987 --> 00:05:23,123
do you a solid.

126
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:25,831
Move in, split the rent
"fiddy-fiddy."

127
00:05:25,942 --> 00:05:29,937
Or, 40/ "siddy" depending on
square footage of bedrooms.

128
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,909
Come on! Think about it!

129
00:05:31,994 --> 00:05:33,002
Jazzy Jeff!

130
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,270
Hold up!

131
00:05:35,442 --> 00:05:38,007
Hey, uh, you got space
in your crib?

132
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:39,747
Um...

133
00:05:39,824 --> 00:05:41,492
Yes, I-I have a room.

134
00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:42,918
Hmm?

135
00:05:44,045 --> 00:05:46,056
Fuck. Yeah.

136
00:05:46,206 --> 00:05:47,821
Fuck yeah!

137
00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:49,721
There he is!

138
00:05:54,292 --> 00:05:55,496
Nice place.

139
00:05:55,565 --> 00:05:56,701
Yeah.

140
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:59,262
That's what a billion-dollar
evaluation will get you.

141
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:02,801
Hey, what a great topic of
conversation for you and Dana.

142
00:06:04,616 --> 00:06:07,164
- Dana!
- Oh, hey.

143
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:09,840
You're just standing there.
Like a cool cowboy.

144
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,262
Hey, yeah.

145
00:06:11,488 --> 00:06:13,465
I-I really
like your place.

146
00:06:13,793 --> 00:06:15,331
Yeah, me too.

147
00:06:15,629 --> 00:06:17,770
Well, he liked it,
so he bought it.

148
00:06:17,996 --> 00:06:20,034
Right? Just like you
and that hoodie.

149
00:06:20,325 --> 00:06:22,395
So, Dana,
interesting story.

150
00:06:22,543 --> 00:06:25,076
Uh, the reason Richard has
this bandage on his neck,

151
00:06:25,153 --> 00:06:26,887
and that he's got
one on his hand,

152
00:06:27,033 --> 00:06:29,700
is because he got so exhausted
during a code sprint,

153
00:06:29,825 --> 00:06:32,051
that he walked through
a plate-glass window.

154
00:06:32,171 --> 00:06:34,683
Now, I-I read on Pando
that you got injured also

155
00:06:34,752 --> 00:06:35,763
early on at your company?

156
00:06:35,832 --> 00:06:37,231
You should
tell Richard that story.

157
00:06:37,332 --> 00:06:40,293
Right? Interesting topic
between CEOs.

158
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:42,243
If you want.
I mean, you don't have to.

159
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,450
Alright, I'm gonna
go mingle.

160
00:06:44,884 --> 00:06:46,489
Go get 'em.

161
00:06:48,317 --> 00:06:51,629
So, how did you
hurt yourself?

162
00:06:52,532 --> 00:06:54,520
I tried to commit suicide.

163
00:06:58,762 --> 00:07:01,965
Cool. Not...
You know, interesting.

164
00:07:05,197 --> 00:07:08,895
Oh, wow! You cashed
another beer, you partier.

165
00:07:09,035 --> 00:07:10,856
I haven't cut loose
in so long.

166
00:07:10,989 --> 00:07:13,551
I'll probably get sloshed
off of one beer,

167
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:15,246
and start babbling.

168
00:07:15,829 --> 00:07:17,340
That's, um...

169
00:07:17,754 --> 00:07:20,075
Let's have a beer, right?
Let's celebrate!

170
00:07:20,202 --> 00:07:23,088
New job!
New roomies!

171
00:07:23,157 --> 00:07:24,809
New internet, right?

172
00:07:25,066 --> 00:07:27,989
I said I'd get sloshed
off of one beer, crazy man.

173
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,637
Okay, um...

174
00:07:29,714 --> 00:07:31,287
I'm gonna go to bed.
Good night.

175
00:07:31,356 --> 00:07:32,626
No, no, no!
You know what? Hold on!

176
00:07:32,694 --> 00:07:34,910
I'll have...
I'll have one beer!

177
00:07:35,043 --> 00:07:37,387
I'm not saying I don't
like to party, Jeff.

178
00:07:38,616 --> 00:07:41,184
You like vodka?
Let's have a vodka.

179
00:07:41,723 --> 00:07:43,145
Yeah! Let's do vodka.

180
00:07:43,214 --> 00:07:44,550
Okay!

181
00:07:44,983 --> 00:07:46,450
Yeah.

182
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:48,789
That's so much of it.

183
00:07:48,866 --> 00:07:50,648
That's a normal amount
right there.

184
00:07:50,784 --> 00:07:51,962
Is it?

185
00:07:52,828 --> 00:07:53,898
I like it.

186
00:07:53,988 --> 00:07:55,265
It's really cool.

187
00:07:55,403 --> 00:07:56,784
So, who painted it?

188
00:07:57,328 --> 00:07:58,712
A machine.

189
00:07:59,616 --> 00:08:01,160
It's actually the first
work of art

190
00:08:01,237 --> 00:08:03,172
made by AI to be sold
at Sotheby's.

191
00:08:03,297 --> 00:08:05,367
Sorry I'm late, Dana.
I got caught up.

192
00:08:05,734 --> 00:08:08,500
Hey! Hey, wait a minute, you're...
you're Richard Hendricks.

193
00:08:08,664 --> 00:08:09,726
Mm-hmm.

194
00:08:09,795 --> 00:08:11,289
Sorry, I'm, uh,
Ben Burkhardt.

195
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:12,726
I'm... I'm Dana's COO.

196
00:08:13,031 --> 00:08:15,305
Dana told me he invited you.
I'm so psyched you came!

197
00:08:15,574 --> 00:08:18,064
Yeah. I got... I have so many
questions for you, man.

198
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:19,721
Do you want to grab a drink
or do you want to stay here?

199
00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:21,680
- There. Yeah.
- Oh, great.

200
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,880
I mean, even way back when
I was finishing my PhD at MIT,

201
00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:31,492
I would tell anyone
that would listen

202
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:34,125
that a decentralized system
was the obvious eventuality.

203
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,317
Yep. And now it's more
necessary than ever.

204
00:08:36,386 --> 00:08:38,302
I mean, the stuff Google and
Facebook are getting away with.

205
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:39,539
It's insane. Totally.
Right?

206
00:08:39,608 --> 00:08:41,278
That's why I've always said
that the user's data

207
00:08:41,346 --> 00:08:42,772
should be in the hands
of consumers,

208
00:08:42,841 --> 00:08:43,936
not the corporations.

209
00:08:44,055 --> 00:08:46,042
100%, but see,
that can't happen,

210
00:08:46,129 --> 00:08:48,044
until someone iterates
a functional alternative.

211
00:08:48,163 --> 00:08:50,230
Which, I believe, Richard,

212
00:08:50,341 --> 00:08:51,625
I believe you're about to do.

213
00:08:51,719 --> 00:08:53,797
Well, I don't know.
Trying to, yeah.

214
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:57,055
Have you solved, uh, co-locating
data with the compute test?

215
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,937
How do you know about that?

216
00:08:59,074 --> 00:09:00,668
Do you code?
I used to, man.

217
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:02,297
Uh, yeah, I loved it so much,

218
00:09:02,403 --> 00:09:05,586
but, you know, I got drawn
over to the business side.

219
00:09:05,781 --> 00:09:06,831
Richard!

220
00:09:06,908 --> 00:09:07,956
There you are!

221
00:09:08,033 --> 00:09:09,767
Hey. Jared Dunn.
Hi! Ben Burkhardt.

222
00:09:09,836 --> 00:09:11,922
Hey, Dana.
So, it's 9:00 AM in Dubai.

223
00:09:11,991 --> 00:09:13,750
I gotta make a call,
so, excuse me, guys.

224
00:09:13,848 --> 00:09:15,242
Oh.

225
00:09:15,425 --> 00:09:17,172
So, um, Dana
was just telling me

226
00:09:17,241 --> 00:09:19,350
that he prefers
a late lunch, too.

227
00:09:19,472 --> 00:09:20,836
Just like...

228
00:09:21,969 --> 00:09:23,201
Is that right?

229
00:09:23,508 --> 00:09:24,949
Kind of.

230
00:09:25,836 --> 00:09:27,285
Well, I see a colleague.

231
00:09:27,362 --> 00:09:29,898
I'll leave you guys
to... to chat.

232
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:32,125
Cool. Mm...

233
00:09:37,741 --> 00:09:39,453
So, on the way out,
Dana told me

234
00:09:39,522 --> 00:09:41,108
that he really loved
meeting you.

235
00:09:41,202 --> 00:09:42,789
He said it went great!

236
00:09:43,866 --> 00:09:45,160
Did you not think so?

237
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,326
Yeah, it's just...
he didn't really talk, though.

238
00:09:48,403 --> 00:09:50,410
Yeah.
That's one of his quirks.

239
00:09:50,479 --> 00:09:51,500
He's fun.

240
00:09:51,594 --> 00:09:53,719
Hey, you know who I did
have a good conversation with?

241
00:09:53,788 --> 00:09:55,419
- Who?
- His COO.

242
00:09:55,694 --> 00:09:56,997
Who, Ben?

243
00:09:57,074 --> 00:09:59,076
Yeah, um, do you know him?

244
00:09:59,153 --> 00:10:00,705
Um, not well.

245
00:10:00,782 --> 00:10:03,664
I hear he's a very
competent executive.

246
00:10:03,741 --> 00:10:06,248
But apparently,
he left Oculus for Quiver

247
00:10:06,325 --> 00:10:08,113
in kind of an
unprofessional manner.

248
00:10:08,214 --> 00:10:11,705
Hmm, okay. Well, he
really loves Pied Piper.

249
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,917
Jared, come on!
This is your condo.

250
00:10:13,986 --> 00:10:14,988
Sleep in your bed.

251
00:10:15,057 --> 00:10:17,068
Don't be silly. Hey!

252
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,699
Uh, leave the lights on
as long as you want.

253
00:10:29,283 --> 00:10:31,034
Uh, hey, Jared?

254
00:10:31,481 --> 00:10:33,370
Yes?
Um...

255
00:10:34,616 --> 00:10:36,933
Never mind.
Uh, see you tomorrow morning.

256
00:10:37,059 --> 00:10:39,985
Sweet dreams.
Right, if only.

257
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,988
Did I tell you about
Gilfoyle's terrible song?

258
00:10:47,058 --> 00:10:50,495
Yes. Yes, you did.
And I heard it.

259
00:10:51,206 --> 00:10:54,113
I'm... I'm gonna go clean
the rice cooker, Dinesh.

260
00:10:54,252 --> 00:10:56,087
You know what
the worst part is?

261
00:10:56,249 --> 00:10:58,634
He's actually a decent coder.

262
00:10:58,703 --> 00:11:00,206
He almost never fucks up.

263
00:11:00,363 --> 00:11:02,222
Uh, wait, almost?

264
00:11:02,359 --> 00:11:05,105
One time,
he royally fucked up,

265
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,667
but even then,
he ended up saving the day

266
00:11:07,736 --> 00:11:09,079
with all his fridges.

267
00:11:10,394 --> 00:11:11,609
Fridges?

268
00:11:11,725 --> 00:11:13,314
Seppen Smart Fridges!

269
00:11:13,532 --> 00:11:14,762
And you know what?

270
00:11:15,033 --> 00:11:16,410
It was totally illegal.

271
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,322
Really? Illegal?

272
00:11:18,391 --> 00:11:22,023
So, tell me about these fridges.
Jeff!

273
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,739
I can't tell you that.

274
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,030
It's a company secret.

275
00:11:25,099 --> 00:11:28,391
Okay, um, let me get you
some more vodka, Dinesh.

276
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,014
Thank you guys for
seeing me on such short notice.

277
00:11:33,082 --> 00:11:34,667
Well, it's an honor
to have you, Gavin.

278
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:37,723
Back there, we test our
compressor run capacitors.

279
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:40,694
But here is what I'm sure you'll
be most interested in seeing.

280
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:43,697
This is our smart fridge
development team.

281
00:11:43,792 --> 00:11:46,367
To be honest,
we were a little nervous

282
00:11:46,454 --> 00:11:48,665
about wading into the
Internet-enabled market.

283
00:11:48,747 --> 00:11:49,942
Over the last 80 years,

284
00:11:50,057 --> 00:11:51,905
we've built a real trust
with our customers.

285
00:11:51,974 --> 00:11:53,473
Alright! Great tour!

286
00:11:53,614 --> 00:11:55,447
Oh, there's a lot more to see.

287
00:11:55,516 --> 00:11:57,481
Ugh. Why? Look.

288
00:11:57,632 --> 00:11:59,355
I came here to offer you
a partnership

289
00:11:59,433 --> 00:12:00,848
to cut down your server bills.

290
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,140
Oh!

291
00:12:02,209 --> 00:12:04,680
Well, our server costs
were far higher

292
00:12:04,783 --> 00:12:06,182
than we anticipated.

293
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:08,111
As we said,
we're not well versed in...

294
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,346
The 20th century?
Yeah, you mentioned that.

295
00:12:10,475 --> 00:12:12,681
Do you want to save
a fortune or not?

296
00:12:12,758 --> 00:12:13,773
Well, yes.

297
00:12:13,842 --> 00:12:15,806
In exchange, I need you
to do something for me

298
00:12:15,883 --> 00:12:18,488
with regard to the people
who hacked your refrigerators.

299
00:12:18,633 --> 00:12:20,530
I'm going to destroy
their lives.

300
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,778
So, what? Ben: So...

301
00:12:23,945 --> 00:12:25,606
- So, I turned to Bill Gates...
- Yeah?

302
00:12:25,675 --> 00:12:26,957
Right, and I said...

303
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,315
"I don't know, Bill.
Maybe you should Google it."

304
00:12:30,402 --> 00:12:31,981
You said that to Bill Gates?

305
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,682
I did! I swear.

306
00:12:35,099 --> 00:12:36,338
Hey...

307
00:12:36,537 --> 00:12:38,895
can I ask you, um...

308
00:12:39,324 --> 00:12:42,566
Did you tell Dana
that we were having lunch?

309
00:12:43,098 --> 00:12:45,450
Richard, I told you that Bill
Gates story for a reason.

310
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,598
I, um, I practice something
called "radical candor."

311
00:12:48,739 --> 00:12:51,331
Which is no matter how
uncomfortable the truth is,

312
00:12:51,516 --> 00:12:52,745
I'm gonna tell it to you.

313
00:12:52,888 --> 00:12:55,460
And the honest truth is...

314
00:12:55,714 --> 00:12:57,820
I did not tell Dana
about this lunch.

315
00:12:58,891 --> 00:13:01,765
Things with Dana
have gotten stagnant.

316
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,921
But the other night...

317
00:13:04,022 --> 00:13:05,772
talking to you, Richard, I...

318
00:13:05,932 --> 00:13:08,179
I felt that spark again.

319
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,270
- What are you saying?
- Okay, well.

320
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:11,972
The first tenet
of rad-can, Richard,

321
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,831
is to just... is to just
say what you think,

322
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,632
and so I'm gonna do that.
I'm gonna say what I think,

323
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,500
and, Richard, I think
we should work together.

324
00:13:18,226 --> 00:13:20,468
Oh. You mean, like...?

325
00:13:20,537 --> 00:13:22,715
Like, I could be your COO.

326
00:13:24,891 --> 00:13:26,058
Um...

327
00:13:27,016 --> 00:13:28,419
I don't know.

328
00:13:29,933 --> 00:13:32,019
Maybe we shouldn't
be doing this.

329
00:13:32,105 --> 00:13:33,436
Whoa, whoa, Richard.

330
00:13:33,538 --> 00:13:35,053
We're just talking.

331
00:13:35,225 --> 00:13:36,897
You see any numbers
written down here?

332
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,106
Do you see a Power Point?

333
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,370
No, we don't even
have a laptop.

334
00:13:39,438 --> 00:13:42,329
Exactly! 'Cause we're not doing
anything wrong. Oh, shit!

335
00:13:43,081 --> 00:13:45,149
- Party of one.
- Sh... Shit.

336
00:13:45,507 --> 00:13:47,654
I looked at his calendar
and it said he had a meeting.

337
00:13:47,723 --> 00:13:49,404
Okay, Richard, I'm gonna
continue being honest with you

338
00:13:49,472 --> 00:13:51,197
and tell you that I have to
leave now through the kitchen.

339
00:13:51,265 --> 00:13:52,613
- Okay.
- Okay, please don't tell anyone

340
00:13:52,681 --> 00:13:54,865
- about this.
- Okay.

341
00:13:58,624 --> 00:13:59,999
What? Hey!

342
00:14:00,068 --> 00:14:02,755
Hey, Dana! What the heck?
Dana, right?

343
00:14:02,835 --> 00:14:03,965
Oh, hi.

344
00:14:04,034 --> 00:14:06,206
I'm just... Are you
having lunch alone?

345
00:14:06,275 --> 00:14:07,779
I am!
I'm totally alone.

346
00:14:07,856 --> 00:14:09,620
Uh, in fact...

347
00:14:09,944 --> 00:14:11,370
do you want to, uh,

348
00:14:11,439 --> 00:14:13,404
join me at my table for one?

349
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:15,373
Oh, okay.

350
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:16,596
Sure.

351
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:18,429
Come on over.

352
00:14:21,601 --> 00:14:24,485
One beef pot pie. One
beef pot pie, no carrots.

353
00:14:25,134 --> 00:14:26,513
Yep. Here.

354
00:14:26,582 --> 00:14:28,092
Put 'em here.

355
00:14:30,215 --> 00:14:33,582
I love beef pot pie.

356
00:14:34,059 --> 00:14:36,658
And only kind of
like carrots.

357
00:14:42,957 --> 00:14:44,592
Oh, fuck!

358
00:14:44,986 --> 00:14:46,730
Gilfoyle, goddammit.

359
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:49,551
Could you please stop that fucking noise?
I'm serious.

360
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,882
How will I know
when to remote toggle my rig?

361
00:14:51,951 --> 00:14:54,119
Easy, you won't,
and neither will any of us,

362
00:14:54,191 --> 00:14:56,113
because you won't
remote toggle anything!

363
00:14:56,297 --> 00:14:58,538
No more remote toggling!
Got it?

364
00:14:58,728 --> 00:14:59,849
- Just...
- Hey.

365
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,242
Hey! How was lunch,
you little minx?

366
00:15:02,311 --> 00:15:03,503
What?

367
00:15:03,572 --> 00:15:05,075
Yeah, you thought
I wouldn't find out.

368
00:15:05,232 --> 00:15:06,802
I was, uh, texting with Dana.

369
00:15:06,871 --> 00:15:08,399
Just checking in.
And he mentioned

370
00:15:08,468 --> 00:15:11,242
- that you two met up.
- Oh, yeah!

371
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:13,572
Yeah! Just, just
briefly for... yeah.

372
00:15:13,641 --> 00:15:16,675
Yeah! I-I-I knew you two
would hit it off.

373
00:15:16,986 --> 00:15:18,788
You know, Dana did mention

374
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:20,873
that he thought
you might be bulimic.

375
00:15:20,942 --> 00:15:22,243
Okay.

376
00:15:22,428 --> 00:15:24,492
Great, um...

377
00:15:24,828 --> 00:15:28,179
Jared, do you think
it's time we hire a COO?

378
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:29,324
Oh!

379
00:15:29,466 --> 00:15:31,460
Did Dana suggest
we hire someone like Ben?

380
00:15:31,547 --> 00:15:32,867
Yeah. Yeah, like Ben.

381
00:15:32,944 --> 00:15:34,603
You see, if you didn't
have lunch with Dana,

382
00:15:34,671 --> 00:15:35,988
this never would've come up.

383
00:15:36,132 --> 00:15:38,030
I'll put together a list.

384
00:15:38,359 --> 00:15:39,728
Great.

385
00:15:40,478 --> 00:15:41,812
Um...

386
00:15:42,449 --> 00:15:44,496
Richard, you should see this.

387
00:15:46,861 --> 00:15:48,527
What the fuck?

388
00:15:48,743 --> 00:15:52,165
Seppen is suing us
for $10 million in damages.

389
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,631
The complaint
specifically cites,

390
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,337
"sullying their smart fridges
with mime-simulated fellatio."

391
00:15:58,472 --> 00:16:00,777
"Our customers invite us
into their homes.

392
00:16:00,889 --> 00:16:02,615
"The kitchen is
the modern hearth.

393
00:16:02,684 --> 00:16:05,695
We cannot have that trust
violated." Is that a typo?

394
00:16:05,774 --> 00:16:07,133
Do they mean "heart"?

395
00:16:07,205 --> 00:16:09,078
How did Seppen
find out it was us?

396
00:16:09,147 --> 00:16:10,295
I don't know.

397
00:16:10,364 --> 00:16:11,450
You tell us, Gilfoyle.

398
00:16:11,527 --> 00:16:13,595
You said you pulled
all our code and bleached it.

399
00:16:13,664 --> 00:16:14,843
Maybe you missed something.

400
00:16:14,912 --> 00:16:15,993
No.

401
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,201
No way.

402
00:16:17,439 --> 00:16:19,492
They have no proof it was us.
Ignore them.

403
00:16:19,624 --> 00:16:22,080
Ignore them? What the fuck
kind of solution is that?

404
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:24,575
No. "Hearth."
It's a word. Huh!

405
00:16:24,644 --> 00:16:27,455
We don't need to solve anything.
They have nothing.

406
00:16:27,524 --> 00:16:29,576
Well, I'm pretty sure
they have something, Gilfoyle.

407
00:16:29,645 --> 00:16:32,591
So you fucked up somewhere!
I didn't fuck up.

408
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,293
Well, guys, I'm sure there's
something we can do here.

409
00:16:35,443 --> 00:16:36,851
Uh, just give me a second.

410
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:45,028
Hey, sorry!
I-I can't talk right now.

411
00:16:45,152 --> 00:16:46,481
Can we meet up?

412
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:48,506
Um, my place. Midnight.

413
00:16:48,655 --> 00:16:50,286
Okay, I gotta go.

414
00:16:50,626 --> 00:16:51,827
Okay.

415
00:16:57,426 --> 00:16:58,724
Okay, so wait.

416
00:16:58,793 --> 00:17:00,741
You're telling me
this Gilfoyle guy

417
00:17:00,892 --> 00:17:03,188
first hacked into the fridges
as a prank?

418
00:17:03,386 --> 00:17:04,713
Without your knowledge?

419
00:17:04,872 --> 00:17:06,243
Uh, yeah.

420
00:17:06,381 --> 00:17:08,037
Well, there you go, Richard!

421
00:17:08,106 --> 00:17:10,592
If you didn't authorize it, then
he's acting as a rogue agent.

422
00:17:10,661 --> 00:17:13,173
You tell Seppen that
and Pied Piper's off scot-free.

423
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:15,888
Yeah, but what would
happen to Gilfoyle?

424
00:17:15,957 --> 00:17:18,008
I don't know. There'd be
criminal and civil charges

425
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:19,421
he'd have to deal
with on his own.

426
00:17:19,489 --> 00:17:20,792
Oh, Jesus!

427
00:17:20,918 --> 00:17:22,909
I don't know.
Sounds kinda brutal.

428
00:17:23,237 --> 00:17:25,462
In the end, being on
those fridges saved us.

429
00:17:25,534 --> 00:17:28,821
Richard, I-I told you
about radical candor, yeah?

430
00:17:29,579 --> 00:17:31,469
Well, what I'm getting
from you now,

431
00:17:31,689 --> 00:17:33,659
is the opposite of that.

432
00:17:34,018 --> 00:17:36,822
It's actually something
we call "ruinous empathy."

433
00:17:37,433 --> 00:17:38,988
You want to destroy
your entire company

434
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:41,472
just to keep one
bad actor happy?

435
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,404
That's not fair
to you, Richard!

436
00:17:43,633 --> 00:17:46,784
Oh, come on. Gilfoyle
will never be happy.

437
00:17:46,994 --> 00:17:48,593
This is exactly
the kinda thing

438
00:17:48,662 --> 00:17:50,972
I could help you with
if you hired me.

439
00:17:53,986 --> 00:17:55,842
Hey, any news?

440
00:17:57,275 --> 00:18:00,118
Oh, goddammit. Why is that thing
still fucking doing that?

441
00:18:00,195 --> 00:18:01,988
I guess Gilfoyle
forgot to turn it off.

442
00:18:02,065 --> 00:18:03,616
It's been doing
that all morning.

443
00:18:04,806 --> 00:18:06,241
I don't have his password.

444
00:18:07,325 --> 00:18:09,504
Bitcoin is really
volatile today.

445
00:18:09,573 --> 00:18:11,701
Yeah, okay.
Uh, where is he?

446
00:18:11,853 --> 00:18:14,708
Well, it's 10:00 AM,
so not here.

447
00:18:16,127 --> 00:18:19,510
Okay, you know what?
Fuck Gilfoyle.

448
00:18:19,589 --> 00:18:20,639
Fuck him right to hell.

449
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,028
I've been saying that
for years.

450
00:18:22,097 --> 00:18:23,376
Where's Jared?

451
00:18:28,369 --> 00:18:29,988
Richard, are you serious?

452
00:18:30,065 --> 00:18:31,338
Yes.

453
00:18:31,489 --> 00:18:34,265
Well, I concede that laying
it all at Gilfoyle's feet

454
00:18:34,334 --> 00:18:36,679
might get us out
of the Seppen lawsuit, but...

455
00:18:37,171 --> 00:18:40,079
I mean, you'd really throw
him to the wolves like that?

456
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,540
That doesn't sound like you.

457
00:18:41,609 --> 00:18:43,393
Well, maybe
I'm just becoming

458
00:18:43,462 --> 00:18:45,426
a little less
ruinously empathetic.

459
00:18:45,664 --> 00:18:47,634
Have you been
seeing a therapist?

460
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:48,882
No.

461
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,242
But...

462
00:18:51,614 --> 00:18:54,952
I have been seeing Ben.

463
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:56,445
Ben Burkhardt.

464
00:18:56,522 --> 00:18:58,232
Oh, Richard, no.

465
00:18:58,412 --> 00:19:00,123
He's Dana's COO. You're...

466
00:19:00,277 --> 00:19:02,809
You're jeopardizing your
entire friendship with Dana.

467
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,787
What friendship with Dana?

468
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,479
Who could be friends
with that guy?

469
00:19:06,548 --> 00:19:07,679
I got news for you, Jared.

470
00:19:07,748 --> 00:19:09,078
Dana sucks, man!

471
00:19:09,147 --> 00:19:10,200
Richard!

472
00:19:10,277 --> 00:19:11,408
I mean, he is a dog.

473
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:13,320
How did he even found
his own company?

474
00:19:13,397 --> 00:19:14,559
Is he even smart?

475
00:19:14,628 --> 00:19:15,880
Okay, that's unfair.

476
00:19:15,998 --> 00:19:18,051
Look, this is your company.

477
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:20,320
And you can work with
whomever you want.

478
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:22,574
But I need you
to think long and hard

479
00:19:22,651 --> 00:19:24,611
about what you're
proposing to do to Gilfoyle.

480
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,954
We're talking about
criminal charges here.

481
00:19:27,023 --> 00:19:28,359
He could be deported.

482
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,353
There has to be
another option.

483
00:19:30,422 --> 00:19:32,345
Well, no offense, Jared,

484
00:19:32,431 --> 00:19:34,483
but Ben says there isn't.

485
00:19:34,735 --> 00:19:36,908
Okay? And he is
a world-class COO

486
00:19:36,985 --> 00:19:39,664
that has brought multiple
companies to a billion dollars.

487
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:42,089
And you're just
a biz dev guy.

488
00:19:43,943 --> 00:19:46,219
I'm... I'm sorry. I...

489
00:19:46,472 --> 00:19:49,432
I just think that
in this particular situation,

490
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:52,740
Ben might know
a little better.

491
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:55,276
Okay.

492
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,320
You're the boss.

493
00:20:00,402 --> 00:20:02,023
You know,
but I will say this.

494
00:20:02,092 --> 00:20:04,468
If you're really going
to start working with Ben,

495
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,545
at least give Dana
the common courtesy

496
00:20:06,614 --> 00:20:09,115
of telling him the truth
about what you guys are doing.

497
00:20:09,525 --> 00:20:11,789
Because if you
don't tell him...

498
00:20:12,522 --> 00:20:14,132
you're the dog.

499
00:20:30,278 --> 00:20:31,904
Thanks for, uh,
having me over.

500
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:35,034
Of course. So, it's gonna
be a bit weird at first.

501
00:20:35,263 --> 00:20:36,886
Then it's gonna be okay.

502
00:20:37,229 --> 00:20:38,234
What?

503
00:20:55,131 --> 00:20:56,583
Hi, this is Jared Dunn.

504
00:20:56,671 --> 00:20:59,021
Um, sorry, I don't
recognize this number.

505
00:20:59,228 --> 00:21:03,042
Jared? Come here now.

506
00:21:03,269 --> 00:21:04,728
Jian-Yang?

507
00:21:05,403 --> 00:21:08,618
So... Ben told me everything.

508
00:21:09,438 --> 00:21:10,770
Oh!

509
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:12,225
Uh...

510
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:13,664
Well...

511
00:21:13,812 --> 00:21:15,731
Radical candor,
I guess, right?

512
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,415
Yeah, he told me how
you kept texting him non-stop.

513
00:21:18,589 --> 00:21:20,982
And he kept refusing,
but you were relentless.

514
00:21:21,051 --> 00:21:22,140
What?

515
00:21:22,225 --> 00:21:25,223
- Uh, no!
- Richard, it's... It's immaterial.

516
00:21:25,485 --> 00:21:27,129
The point is,
Dana knows everything now.

517
00:21:27,274 --> 00:21:29,821
However it came to that,
it's just words in the winds.

518
00:21:29,893 --> 00:21:31,284
"Words in the winds"?

519
00:21:31,353 --> 00:21:32,446
Yeah.

520
00:21:32,515 --> 00:21:35,491
Well, Richard, looks like
you got what you wanted.

521
00:21:35,888 --> 00:21:37,116
You're both adults.

522
00:21:37,222 --> 00:21:38,866
You can work together
if you want.

523
00:21:38,943 --> 00:21:41,404
I just wish you'd demonstrated
the measure of spirit

524
00:21:41,481 --> 00:21:43,153
to discuss this
with me to my face.

525
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,586
But...

526
00:21:44,943 --> 00:21:48,320
guess there's no honor
among thieves, hmm?

527
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,061
Well...

528
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:51,381
good luck, gentlemen.

529
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:53,127
You deserve each other.

530
00:21:54,553 --> 00:21:56,096
Dana.

531
00:22:00,468 --> 00:22:01,995
Wow.

532
00:22:02,569 --> 00:22:05,112
You know, I've never
really seen him like that.

533
00:22:05,189 --> 00:22:06,714
He's so assertive.

534
00:22:06,852 --> 00:22:08,120
Uh, articulate.

535
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:10,237
Yeah, he's had a head cold
the last couple weeks.

536
00:22:10,314 --> 00:22:11,404
Been pretty low energy.

537
00:22:11,473 --> 00:22:12,679
Really?

538
00:22:12,853 --> 00:22:14,242
Yep!

539
00:22:14,363 --> 00:22:17,342
Oh!
So, I guess...

540
00:22:17,509 --> 00:22:19,526
You and me, huh, Richard?

541
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,125
Together, at last.

542
00:22:21,275 --> 00:22:22,651
Yeah.

543
00:22:24,392 --> 00:22:26,185
Dana rides a motorcycle?

544
00:22:26,515 --> 00:22:27,686
Yep.

545
00:22:28,194 --> 00:22:29,360
Cool.

546
00:22:34,534 --> 00:22:37,211
So, uh, what
exactly did you...

547
00:22:38,401 --> 00:22:41,248
The witch lost his mind.

548
00:22:42,182 --> 00:22:44,172
Gilfoyle, you smoke?

549
00:22:44,272 --> 00:22:46,389
I kept mulling
that Seppen shit.

550
00:22:47,446 --> 00:22:49,463
I didn't leave a bit
of my code on that fridge.

551
00:22:49,677 --> 00:22:52,506
No remnants, nothing,
so how do they know?

552
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,206
Then I realized...

553
00:22:54,357 --> 00:22:55,938
they're listening to us.

554
00:22:56,757 --> 00:22:58,987
They've been listening to us
this whole fucking time.

555
00:22:59,064 --> 00:23:00,474
Right.
All these devices

556
00:23:00,543 --> 00:23:02,150
are listening to us!

557
00:23:02,539 --> 00:23:04,300
Okay, um...

558
00:23:04,735 --> 00:23:07,404
Gilfoyle, I-I think
you need some rest.

559
00:23:07,473 --> 00:23:08,541
Not yet.

560
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:10,477
I checked their firmware
and their logs.

561
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:13,258
The fridge is set
to record constantly

562
00:23:13,327 --> 00:23:14,829
streaming everything
back to the cloud.

563
00:23:14,897 --> 00:23:16,736
They must have gone
through those audio logs,

564
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:18,567
and listened
to our conversations.

565
00:23:18,908 --> 00:23:21,647
Wait, even if they
aren't listening to us,

566
00:23:21,934 --> 00:23:25,335
just the fact that
they could be is interesting.

567
00:23:25,564 --> 00:23:26,906
Shit.

568
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:28,816
They make smoke detectors.

569
00:23:28,885 --> 00:23:30,816
I think there's one
in the kitchen.

570
00:23:30,935 --> 00:23:32,740
Those fuckers are listening.

571
00:23:34,068 --> 00:23:35,639
Jian-Yang, are...
Are you copying

572
00:23:35,718 --> 00:23:37,920
all those companies for the
Chinese markets?

573
00:23:38,222 --> 00:23:39,285
Oh, no.

574
00:23:39,815 --> 00:23:41,636
Fuck you, Seppen.

575
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,472
Hey! Where have you been?

576
00:23:54,693 --> 00:23:56,722
Um, I stayed at
Big Head's last night.

577
00:23:56,864 --> 00:23:58,819
Yeah. Oh, God, I've been
calling all night.

578
00:23:58,889 --> 00:24:01,457
Yeah. I just didn't feel like
getting reprimanded.

579
00:24:01,527 --> 00:24:02,991
I-I thought maybe
you were locked

580
00:24:03,068 --> 00:24:05,283
in another Starbucks
bathroom overnight.

581
00:24:05,352 --> 00:24:06,908
One time, Jared.
One time.

582
00:24:06,985 --> 00:24:09,563
Okay, you're just gonna have
to catch up on the fly, then.

583
00:24:09,813 --> 00:24:12,031
On the fly, what?

584
00:24:15,482 --> 00:24:16,761
Richard Hendricks,

585
00:24:17,007 --> 00:24:19,984
- this is Tom and Viola from Seppen.
- How do you do?

586
00:24:20,189 --> 00:24:21,908
Oh, hi.
Alright, uh,

587
00:24:21,985 --> 00:24:23,778
we won't take up
any more of your time.

588
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:26,799
Richard has called you
in today, because...

589
00:24:26,988 --> 00:24:28,627
of this.

590
00:24:29,062 --> 00:24:31,829
Um, this is Seppen's Smart
Fridge Terms of Service,

591
00:24:31,926 --> 00:24:33,449
where you specifically state

592
00:24:33,522 --> 00:24:36,242
that only refrigerator
command-related user data

593
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:38,279
will be uploaded
to your cloud's service.

594
00:24:38,356 --> 00:24:39,567
That's correct.

595
00:24:39,636 --> 00:24:42,643
We believe that the refrigerator
is the hearth of the modern...

596
00:24:42,712 --> 00:24:44,682
Stop talking.

597
00:24:45,064 --> 00:24:47,083
We know your refrigerators
are streaming

598
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,165
all recorded audio
to the cloud.

599
00:24:49,271 --> 00:24:51,175
Every single conversation.

600
00:24:51,334 --> 00:24:54,360
Which is tantamount
to illegal wiretapping.

601
00:24:55,056 --> 00:24:57,689
You thought a mime
performing fellatio was bad?

602
00:24:57,912 --> 00:24:59,539
What happens when
your customers find out

603
00:24:59,607 --> 00:25:01,216
that every single thing
they've ever said

604
00:25:01,285 --> 00:25:04,563
in front of their "hearth"
has been recorded?

605
00:25:06,685 --> 00:25:07,816
Oh, shit.

606
00:25:08,454 --> 00:25:10,481
We never listen
to any recordings.

607
00:25:10,608 --> 00:25:13,820
Look, we never wanted to get into
this tech stuff in the first place,

608
00:25:13,897 --> 00:25:15,636
but our marketing
department insisted.

609
00:25:15,705 --> 00:25:17,239
Between us...

610
00:25:17,735 --> 00:25:20,765
Gavin Belson was the one
that pushed us to sue you.

611
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:22,901
Is there something
we can do here?

612
00:25:24,301 --> 00:25:25,766
This is a deal memo

613
00:25:25,851 --> 00:25:29,297
stating that Pied Piper
will fix your security issue,

614
00:25:29,366 --> 00:25:30,608
and update your system

615
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:32,722
to Pied Piper's stack
in the future

616
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:34,504
which will lower
your server costs

617
00:25:34,573 --> 00:25:36,570
and improve the security
of your fridges.

618
00:25:36,647 --> 00:25:38,987
In exchange,
you drop the suit.

619
00:25:39,091 --> 00:25:40,208
Uh, Richard?

620
00:25:40,277 --> 00:25:43,026
Did I state that correctly?
Is that our offer?

621
00:25:44,118 --> 00:25:46,259
Uh-huh. Yep.

622
00:25:47,284 --> 00:25:49,952
I'd also like to tell you
I have a Seppen bread machine,

623
00:25:50,022 --> 00:25:52,408
and I have never been
happier with an appliance.

624
00:25:52,578 --> 00:25:54,421
- Pleasure.
- Thank you so much.

625
00:25:55,943 --> 00:25:57,073
Hey.

626
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,624
I'm so sorry if
I overstepped my bounds.

627
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:01,551
It's just time
was of the essence.

628
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:04,239
- Are you kidding me?
- Jared, you saved us.

629
00:26:04,509 --> 00:26:07,727
And you did it without
having to fuck Gilfoyle over.

630
00:26:07,796 --> 00:26:09,498
- Thanks!
- Yeah, um...

631
00:26:09,689 --> 00:26:11,819
We should talk about
what they said about Gavin.

632
00:26:11,888 --> 00:26:13,727
Hello, Pied Piper!

633
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:16,180
Nice gender mix.

634
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,285
Could use a little
more color.

635
00:26:18,569 --> 00:26:20,658
Baby steps, right?
Where do you want me?

636
00:26:21,075 --> 00:26:23,369
- What are you doing here?
- What are you talking about?

637
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:25,315
Well, I-I said I'd call you.

638
00:26:25,384 --> 00:26:27,049
I didn't say I was hiring you.

639
00:26:27,184 --> 00:26:28,415
Richard...

640
00:26:28,543 --> 00:26:30,696
I-I left Dana for you.

641
00:26:30,765 --> 00:26:32,063
I know. Ha!

642
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:33,762
I'm aware.

643
00:26:34,235 --> 00:26:35,290
But...

644
00:26:35,462 --> 00:26:37,672
let me try a little
radical candor.

645
00:26:37,998 --> 00:26:41,408
Um, cheating on your CEO

646
00:26:41,485 --> 00:26:42,756
and then blaming it all on me

647
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:46,061
is not really the kind of
behavior I like to reward.

648
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:50,156
Nor is pushing me
to put my friend in jail.

649
00:26:51,823 --> 00:26:54,657
- Okay.
- You want candor, Richard?

650
00:26:55,142 --> 00:26:58,290
You are objectively
making a huge mistake.

651
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:00,204
I'm a world-class COO, okay?

652
00:27:00,273 --> 00:27:01,745
And your heavy metal friend?

653
00:27:01,951 --> 00:27:03,499
I mean, he's obviously a dick.

654
00:27:03,642 --> 00:27:05,430
And you know...
You know what else, Richard?

655
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:07,576
You're 20 to 30 pounds
underweight.

656
00:27:07,813 --> 00:27:09,307
It's gross.

657
00:27:10,985 --> 00:27:13,448
Who was that?
He seemed smart!

658
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:16,864
Hey, Richard?

659
00:27:17,356 --> 00:27:19,875
I'm at least
45 pounds underweight.

660
00:27:20,072 --> 00:27:22,287
Okay, and don't
worry about him.

661
00:27:22,356 --> 00:27:24,865
We're gonna find you
a much better COO.

662
00:27:25,349 --> 00:27:27,229
I think we already have.

663
00:27:31,025 --> 00:27:32,500
You want the job?

664
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:35,741
Jared, uh...

665
00:27:35,818 --> 00:27:37,442
Alright, okay.

666
00:27:37,569 --> 00:27:38,920
- I'm okay.
- I know, just take it...

667
00:27:38,988 --> 00:27:39,986
Everyone can see you.

668
00:27:40,055 --> 00:27:41,787
- Oh my God.
- Yeah, let's have a seat.

669
00:27:41,856 --> 00:27:43,612
- Just think about it.
- I'm okay!

670
00:27:43,681 --> 00:27:45,276
Yeah, let's...

671
00:27:45,396 --> 00:27:48,369
Do you want some water?
Just breathe, just breathe.

672
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:51,715
Seppen said that Gavin was
pushing them to sue us, right?

673
00:27:51,855 --> 00:27:54,210
Uh, yeah, but that
shouldn't be a surprise.

674
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:56,433
But Seppen had no idea
that we broke in.

675
00:27:56,522 --> 00:27:58,238
How the fuck did Gavin know?

676
00:27:58,658 --> 00:27:59,796
Right!

677
00:28:00,375 --> 00:28:02,982
W-W-What? Are you
suggesting that...

678
00:28:03,068 --> 00:28:06,195
someone in here is leaking
info to Gavin Belson?

679
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,748
I am.

Um, yeah, bad news.

683
00:28:19,693 --> 00:28:23,322
Seppen just left, and... and it
looks like they're gonna settle.

684
00:28:24,098 --> 00:28:26,427
Hey! Dude.

685
