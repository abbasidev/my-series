Uh, I'm sorry.

717
00:28:22,658 --> 00:28:24,858
What part of this would we be renting?

718
00:28:24,894 --> 00:28:26,031
All of it.

719
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:27,289
What?

720
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:29,863
JARED: Yeah, we're signing
new developers every day.

721
00:28:29,899 --> 00:28:32,399
That's gonna require hundreds
of new engineers, Richard.

722
00:28:32,434 --> 00:28:34,001
MONICA: And the staff to support them.

723
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:37,362
Legal, accounting, HR, government affairs.

724
00:28:37,362 --> 00:28:38,795
RICHARD: Whoa. Why would we need that?

725
00:28:39,021 --> 00:28:40,951
MONICA: To deal with things like the NSA.

726
00:28:40,951 --> 00:28:41,955
They called yesterday.

727
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:43,920
They have a lot of
questions about our tech.

728
00:28:44,024 --> 00:28:45,805
And about inserting a back door.

729
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:47,316
We can push back.

730
00:28:47,343 --> 00:28:48,356
RICHARD: Against the government?

731
00:28:48,356 --> 00:28:50,322
- DINESH: I don't love that.
- GILFOYLE: I do.

732
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:52,246
MONICA: Do you guys wanna
see the second floor?

733
00:28:52,271 --> 00:28:53,216
RICHARD: There's another floor?

734
00:28:53,241 --> 00:28:54,515
MONICA: There's three more, actually.

735
00:28:54,515 --> 00:28:56,049
This all used to be part of Hooli.

736
00:28:56,791 --> 00:28:57,823
RICHARD: Okay.

737
00:28:57,848 --> 00:29:00,682

739
00:29:02,556 --> 00:29:04,323
JARED: I know. It's exciting, right?
