00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,501
... anything you want to tell us?

2
00:00:01,502 --> 00:00:03,419
I respect you all?

00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,381
"AT&T and YaoNet close deal".

4
00:00:06,882 --> 00:00:09,158
Wow. Bombshell.

5
00:00:09,159 --> 00:00:11,162
Our network's slowing down because

6
00:00:11,163 --> 00:00:12,868
YaoNet's here, and they're attacking us.

7
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:15,044
We did not come here
to attack you, simply

8
00:00:15,045 --> 00:00:17,363
in order to see how you
got PiperNet to work,

9
00:00:17,364 --> 00:00:19,557
which it turns out you did not.

10
00:00:19,558 --> 00:00:21,292
Pied Piper does not scale.

11
00:00:21,293 --> 00:00:22,568
Worthless piece of...

12
00:00:22,569 --> 00:00:25,747
I don't need to use Gilfoyle's A.I.

13
00:00:25,748 --> 00:00:27,457
in order to improve middle-out.

14
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:31,637
I need to use middle-out
to create a new A.I.

15
00:00:31,638 --> 00:00:32,789
Holy shit.

16
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,298
Our network overhead
must've massively shrunk.

17
00:00:35,299 --> 00:00:37,300
It worked. It... It...
It... It happened.

18
00:00:37,301 --> 00:00:39,135
We did it!

19
00:00:39,136 --> 00:00:41,721
And out of the left side, you can see...

20
00:00:41,722 --> 00:00:43,515
I don't know what that is.

You can just talk to me.
Can you introduce yourself?

25
00:01:08,707 --> 00:01:10,550
Sure, yeah. Um...

26
00:01:10,551 --> 00:01:12,701
Uh, my name is Richard Hendricks,

27
00:01:12,702 --> 00:01:14,504
- and I'm the...
- Could you... ?

28
00:01:14,505 --> 00:01:16,631
- My name is Richard Hendricks. I'm, uh,

29
00:01:16,632 --> 00:01:19,024
- the founder and CEO of Pied Piper.
- _

30
00:01:19,025 --> 00:01:21,010
I think like most people,
I first heard about

31
00:01:21,011 --> 00:01:22,720
- Pied Piper at TechCrunch Disrupt.
- _

32
00:01:22,721 --> 00:01:24,430
Middle-out was a game changer.

33
00:01:24,431 --> 00:01:27,851
The winner of this year is Pied Piper.

34
00:01:27,852 --> 00:01:30,979
What you have to understand
is conventional compression

35
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:32,981
- was like rubbing two sticks together.
- _

36
00:01:32,982 --> 00:01:35,316
And along comes Pied
Piper, out of nowhere,

37
00:01:35,317 --> 00:01:36,693
with a frickin' blowtorch.

38
00:01:36,694 --> 00:01:38,736
Well, we had really just started

39
00:01:38,737 --> 00:01:40,989
um, a few months earlier,

40
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:44,033
and like a bunch of other
Silicon Valley companies,

41
00:01:44,034 --> 00:01:46,578
we were just working out of a garage.

42
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:48,454
Or a house, really.

43
00:01:48,455 --> 00:01:50,915
- Nice place?
- No.

44
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:52,417
It was like a shit hole,

45
00:01:52,418 --> 00:01:53,877
but there was so much shit in it,

46
00:01:53,878 --> 00:01:55,503
- it was filled all the way up.
- _

47
00:01:55,504 --> 00:01:57,589
- So, it was, like, level with the ground.
- _

48
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,466
If that's true, there
was a little meniscus

49
00:02:00,467 --> 00:02:03,094
- in the shit, and that's where...
- _

50
00:02:03,095 --> 00:02:04,320
our dreams lived.

51
00:02:04,321 --> 00:02:07,098
Not the kind of house you
wanna take your shoes off in.

52
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:10,101
- Yeah, just fuckin' smelled really bad.
- _

53
00:02:10,102 --> 00:02:12,271
- It was all right.
- _

54
00:02:13,606 --> 00:02:15,523
Oh, I was the sloppy girl

55
00:02:15,524 --> 00:02:18,443
in the discotheque, just
twirling and twirling

56
00:02:18,444 --> 00:02:19,902
like the night would never end.

57
00:02:19,903 --> 00:02:22,905
Jian-Yang won the house
from me in a game of chance.

58
00:02:22,906 --> 00:02:25,575
He told me to pick a number
between one and 10.

59
00:02:25,576 --> 00:02:28,620
I picked seven, um, but it was three.

60
00:02:28,621 --> 00:02:29,787
Eh, you live, you learn.

61
00:02:29,788 --> 00:02:32,457
We had knocked around for a few years,

62
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:35,793
trying different iterations
of what we wanted to do.

63
00:02:35,794 --> 00:02:40,381
It was at RussFest when things
really got crazy for us.

64
00:02:40,382 --> 00:02:42,842
It was so much money.

65
00:02:42,843 --> 00:02:44,177
So much.

66
00:02:44,178 --> 00:02:46,847
Yeah. Times were good.

the ledger, and the coin

Well, he's been here all night.

he is in a bit of a state.

Oh, great. Yeah. Sit, sit. Sit, sit.

165
00:07:01,143 --> 00:07:03,102
- Why?
- Just find a seat.

166

- Richard, what's wrong?
- I don't know.

167
00:07:05,188 --> 00:07:07,648
Maybe nothing. Maybe something.

168
00:07:07,649 --> 00:07:09,902
Look, here, I wanna
show you something. Um...

169
00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:12,528
You see? Okay. So, uh,

170
00:07:12,529 --> 00:07:15,489
this was a message I
sent to Monica last week.

171
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,909
She had it framed for me as a gift.

172
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:20,786
Oh, I was gonna get you a gift, but, um,

173
00:07:20,787 --> 00:07:23,164
it was back-ordered,
so it's coming next...

174
00:07:23,165 --> 00:07:25,124
Look at the dots. Count the dots.

175
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:28,002
- Dots?
- The dots! Look, look.

176
00:07:28,003 --> 00:07:32,256
"Every single detail is",
dot-dot-dot, "perfect". Okay?

177
00:07:32,257 --> 00:07:34,300
There are three dots in that ellipsis,

178
00:07:34,301 --> 00:07:37,261
which is the correct
number of dots. However,

179
00:07:37,262 --> 00:07:41,098
in the message that I sent her,

180
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:43,101
there are...

181
00:07:43,769 --> 00:07:46,729
four dots, which is incorrect.

182
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:50,150
Thus, not perfect. It was a joke.

183
00:07:51,276 --> 00:07:54,028
- Was it?
- Yes. Was and is.

184
00:07:55,614 --> 00:07:59,325
Okay, well, uh, I didn't
change your joke, Richard.

185
00:07:59,326 --> 00:08:00,993
That's what I got. Three dots.

186
00:08:02,829 --> 00:08:05,998
Wait, is it... three dots
that's funny or is it four?

187
00:08:05,999 --> 00:08:08,584
Four, four, four. That's
what I sent her, four.

188
00:08:08,585 --> 00:08:11,254
But our messaging is encrypted. So,

189
00:08:11,255 --> 00:08:13,798
how did what I send, four dots,

190
00:08:13,799 --> 00:08:15,758
end up as three dots in her feed?

191
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,593
Data corruption, bit flip,

192
00:08:17,594 --> 00:08:20,513
- just a fluke.
- Yeah, sure. Yeah, that's what I thought.

193
00:08:20,514 --> 00:08:22,974
So, then I checked the
logs, read the math.

194
00:08:22,975 --> 00:08:25,476
The total size of all sent messages

195
00:08:25,477 --> 00:08:27,436
should be the same as the total size

196
00:08:27,437 --> 00:08:29,814
of all received messages, right?

197
00:08:29,815 --> 00:08:33,567
But it's not. The received
messages are smaller.

198
00:08:33,568 --> 00:08:37,321
How? How is that possible? Unless...

199
00:08:37,322 --> 00:08:39,115
our network...

200
00:08:39,116 --> 00:08:41,242
is compressing the content

201
00:08:41,243 --> 00:08:45,121
of encrypted files in transit.

202
00:08:45,122 --> 00:08:47,748
And the only way that is possible

203
00:08:47,749 --> 00:08:50,434
is by bypassing encryption.

204
00:08:50,435 --> 00:08:52,795
- Well, that's impossible.
- I agree.

205
00:08:52,796 --> 00:08:55,048
It makes no sense,

206
00:08:55,549 --> 00:08:58,885
but don't you think we should
figure this out before launch?

207
00:08:59,469 --> 00:09:01,178
Richard, don't do this. Not now.

208
00:09:01,179 --> 00:09:02,555
We launch in four days.

209
00:09:02,556 --> 00:09:04,473
The TV spots are already running.

210
00:09:04,474 --> 00:09:06,508
We're not jeopardizing
billions of dollars

211
00:09:06,509 --> 00:09:07,810
because you're missing a dot.

212
00:09:07,811 --> 00:09:10,062
Should I get everyone in
here to start working on this?

213
00:09:10,063 --> 00:09:12,356
- Well...
- We're beyond that.

214
00:09:12,357 --> 00:09:14,191
The others can't help us now.

215
00:09:14,192 --> 00:09:16,527
Jared, bolt the doors.

216
00:09:16,528 --> 00:09:17,653
What's in the bag?

217
00:09:17,654 --> 00:09:19,489
Clif bars and a gun.

218
00:09:23,118 --> 00:09:25,995
May I be honest?

219
00:09:25,996 --> 00:09:28,706
There was a period of my life in which

220
00:09:28,707 --> 00:09:32,044
I would've rooted for the
failure of Richard Hendricks.

221
00:09:32,794 --> 00:09:35,254
That was a different
Gavin Belson. That was...

222
00:09:35,255 --> 00:09:37,048
- tech icon Gavin Belson,
- _

223
00:09:37,049 --> 00:09:39,008
not literary icon Gavin Belson.

224
00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:41,344
Since leaving Hooli, I've co-authored

225
00:09:41,345 --> 00:09:43,554
37 adult romance novels.

226
00:09:43,555 --> 00:09:46,015
Fondly, Margeaux. The Lighthouse Dancer.

227
00:09:46,016 --> 00:09:47,782
Cold Ice Cream and Hot Kisses.

228
00:09:47,783 --> 00:09:49,977
Over here, The Prince of Puget Sound.

229
00:09:49,978 --> 00:09:52,021
Uh, and lastly, His Hazel Glance.

230
00:09:52,022 --> 00:09:54,398
All international best sellers.

231
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,860
Uh, G-Gavin. A moment, please.

232
00:10:00,238 --> 00:10:02,407
I'm so sorry. A moment.

233
00:10:04,076 --> 00:10:05,576
The fuck is your problem?

234
00:10:05,577 --> 00:10:08,204
You said that this would be an hour.

235
00:10:08,205 --> 00:10:09,789
Well, we're just running a little over.

236
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,458
Yeah, with the lights, and the machines,

237
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:13,584
and the sound equipment,

238
00:10:13,585 --> 00:10:15,336
how is this ever gonna be an hour?

239
00:10:15,337 --> 00:10:17,254
You're acting hysterical, all right?

240
00:10:17,255 --> 00:10:18,923
We'll have plenty of
time to write this...

241
00:10:18,924 --> 00:10:20,841
Yeah, you know what? You know what?

242
00:10:20,842 --> 00:10:23,552
Do your... your little interview.

243
00:10:23,553 --> 00:10:25,096
I'll just write the book myself, okay?

244
00:10:25,097 --> 00:10:27,014
Well, if you could
you would, but you can't.

245
00:10:27,015 --> 00:10:28,682
You're stuck with me,
and I'm stuck with you.

246
00:10:28,683 --> 00:10:30,601
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

247
00:10:30,602 --> 00:10:33,062
That's what Florian says to Claudette

248
00:10:33,063 --> 00:10:34,814
outside the cheese cave!

249
00:10:34,815 --> 00:10:37,066
- Oh my God! That's our third act!
- Third act!

250
00:10:37,067 --> 00:10:39,944
- Yes! Okay, go, put the kettle on.
- Yeah.

251
00:10:39,945 --> 00:10:42,238
I'm terribly sorry. I'm
gonna have to cut this short.

252
00:10:42,239 --> 00:10:43,907
Thank you for coming.

253
00:10:45,951 --> 00:10:49,621
When Richard told me
about the dots last night,

254
00:10:50,288 --> 00:10:52,623
initially, I dismissed it as the ranting

255
00:10:52,624 --> 00:10:55,042
of a self-sabotaging idiot.

256
00:10:55,043 --> 00:10:57,169
But a few hours later when I woke up

257
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:59,964
in a stall in the second
story men's bathroom,

258
00:10:59,965 --> 00:11:01,757
I realized something.

259
00:11:01,758 --> 00:11:03,135
That you're an alcoholic?

260
00:11:03,802 --> 00:11:06,595
Perhaps, but high-functioning.

261
00:11:06,596 --> 00:11:09,515
Much like our network. To wit...

262
00:11:10,684 --> 00:11:13,394
Our internal messaging,
based on HooliChat,

263
00:11:13,395 --> 00:11:15,980
uses a weak encryption standard

264
00:11:15,981 --> 00:11:17,858
known as P-256.

265
00:11:18,483 --> 00:11:20,443
Whether Richard believes it or not,

266
00:11:20,444 --> 00:11:21,986
our network cracked it.

267
00:11:21,987 --> 00:11:23,279
Who allowed it to do that?

268
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,489
We did, when we gave it one job.

269
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,032
To make itself more efficient.

270
00:11:27,033 --> 00:11:28,993
It developed a general solution

271
00:11:28,994 --> 00:11:32,329
to discrete log in polynomial time.

272
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,330
What?

273
00:11:33,331 --> 00:11:35,332
Okay, is this a good thing

274
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:38,085
or a bad thing? Someone
tell me how to feel.

275
00:11:38,086 --> 00:11:41,506
Abject terror for you. Build from there.

276
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,383
Once launched,

277
00:11:44,384 --> 00:11:47,386
our AI will keep learning to break

278
00:11:47,387 --> 00:11:51,015
more and more sophisticated parameters.

279
00:11:51,016 --> 00:11:52,892
Ultimately, this will mean the end

280
00:11:52,893 --> 00:11:54,518
of privacy.

281
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:55,811
Electrical grids,

282
00:11:55,812 --> 00:11:58,355
financial institutions,

283
00:11:58,356 --> 00:12:00,107
the nuclear launch codes

284
00:12:00,108 --> 00:12:02,526
for every single nuclear weapon.

285
00:12:02,527 --> 00:12:04,028
All will be exposed.

286
00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:05,738
Pure violence will become

287
00:12:05,739 --> 00:12:07,615
the only basis of power.

288
00:12:07,616 --> 00:12:09,825
Spare us the apocalyptic desert planet

289
00:12:09,826 --> 00:12:12,244
sci-fi bullshit, Frank Herbert.

290
00:12:12,245 --> 00:12:14,622
Uh, Frank Herbert was a
writer who wrote a series of...

291
00:12:14,623 --> 00:12:17,249
I know who fucking Frank Herbert is.

292
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,084
Oh. I'm sorry.

293
00:12:19,085 --> 00:12:20,628
Was that gendered?

294
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:22,838
- That was gendered.
- Okay, Gilfoyle.

295
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,174
Even if everything
you're saying is right,

296
00:12:25,175 --> 00:12:27,218
and that's where we're headed,

297
00:12:27,219 --> 00:12:28,886
there's gotta be a way to fix it.

298
00:12:28,887 --> 00:12:30,971
Fix what, Richard? The network is doing

299
00:12:30,972 --> 00:12:32,557
exactly what we told it to do.

300
00:12:33,391 --> 00:12:35,684
The AI is optimizing the compression

301
00:12:35,685 --> 00:12:38,146
and the compression
is optimizing the AI.

302
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,398
Everything that makes it successful

303
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:44,654
is exactly what makes it dangerous.

304
00:12:44,655 --> 00:12:47,112
It's a feature, not a bug.

305
00:12:47,113 --> 00:12:49,907
No , no, no. Okay, no.

306
00:12:49,908 --> 00:12:51,242
What are we gonna do about it?

307
00:12:51,243 --> 00:12:52,743
What do you suggest we do about it?

308
00:12:52,744 --> 00:12:54,371
You're gonna make me say it, aren't you?

309
00:12:55,914 --> 00:12:57,998
Fine.

310
00:12:57,999 --> 00:13:00,167
We built a monster.

311
00:13:00,168 --> 00:13:01,418
We need to kill it.

312
00:13:01,419 --> 00:13:04,505
- Fuck.
- Are you out of your mind?

313
00:13:04,506 --> 00:13:07,508
No, no, no, no, no, Gilfoyle.

314
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:10,010
We didn't build a monster, first of all.

315
00:13:10,011 --> 00:13:12,054
We built the single greatest

316
00:13:12,055 --> 00:13:13,807
fucking network, ever, in the world.

317
00:13:14,557 --> 00:13:15,824
That's the big one.

318
00:13:15,825 --> 00:13:18,269
And I'm sorry, you wanna kill it?

319
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:21,021
Now? Now? Now?

320
00:13:21,022 --> 00:13:22,898
We are inches away from the finish line.

321
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:24,441
You wanna fucking kill it?

322
00:13:24,442 --> 00:13:27,319
We did it, man! We built it! It works!

323
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,907
It just needs a little help!
We just gotta fix it, okay?

324
00:13:31,908 --> 00:13:33,549
We don't kill it!

325
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:36,620
That's crazy, man! Kill
yourself is the thing.

326
00:13:36,621 --> 00:13:38,248
Fuck you.

327
00:13:38,995 --> 00:13:40,561
I mean...

328
00:13:40,562 --> 00:13:41,939
that's crazy.

329
00:13:43,586 --> 00:13:46,380
When people ask me about Pied Piper,

330
00:13:46,381 --> 00:13:49,883
I always tell them the same thing.

331
00:13:49,884 --> 00:13:53,013
_

332
00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:56,598
Are there other questions?

333
00:13:56,599 --> 00:13:59,644
Uh, yeah. Can you elaborate?

334
00:14:00,312 --> 00:14:02,313
Mm... yes.

335
00:14:06,776 --> 00:14:08,777
Will you?

336
00:14:08,778 --> 00:14:10,696
Ah...

337
00:14:10,697 --> 00:14:12,324
Hmm...

338
00:14:34,012 --> 00:14:36,848
Save it, Jared. I'm not
in the mood for a pep talk.

339
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,642
You know, if I learned anything
from my time with Gwart,

340
00:14:40,643 --> 00:14:43,479
it's the power of just listening.

341
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,648
Fucking Gilfoyle.

342
00:14:46,483 --> 00:14:49,318
Shut it down? Are you
fucking kidding me?

343
00:14:49,319 --> 00:14:52,321
Throw everything away that
we've been working toward?

344
00:14:52,322 --> 00:14:54,114
Not to mention the fact
that we have a contract

345
00:14:54,115 --> 00:14:55,991
worth billions of dollars.

346
00:14:55,992 --> 00:14:58,369
Yeah, that's a lot of money.

347
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:00,788
And what about all the
other stuff we're gonna do?

348
00:15:00,789 --> 00:15:03,624
I mean, give internet to
underserved communities,

349
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:06,585
students in the homework gap,
refugees, genomic research.

350
00:15:06,586 --> 00:15:08,629
Pied Piper can help
scientists cure cancer.

351
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:11,465
- And cancer is bad.
- Cancer fuckin' sucks!

352
00:15:11,466 --> 00:15:14,051
"Hey, I'd like some cancer, please". No.

353
00:15:14,052 --> 00:15:16,220
And we have this beautiful baby,

354
00:15:16,221 --> 00:15:18,390
who is a little sick...

355
00:15:19,265 --> 00:15:21,558
But, apparently, it's now the devil,

356
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:22,893
and we have to kill it.

357
00:15:22,894 --> 00:15:25,604
I vote we take it to
the doctor, but fuck.

358
00:15:25,605 --> 00:15:27,773
I had a foster mother who
thought I was the devil

359
00:15:27,774 --> 00:15:29,733
and that she had to kill me.

360
00:15:29,734 --> 00:15:32,152
And I think it was pretty
traumatizing for her.

361
00:15:32,153 --> 00:15:34,905
And th-the odds...

362
00:15:34,906 --> 00:15:37,741
of Gilfoyle's stupid crazy

363
00:15:37,742 --> 00:15:40,911
doomsday scenario
actually coming true are...

364
00:15:40,912 --> 00:15:43,080
I mean, we've had a
nuclear arsenal for decades,

365
00:15:43,081 --> 00:15:46,208
and we're fine. I mean,
outside of a couple...

366
00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:48,669
substantial blips. Two in particular.

367
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,546
I'd say we're safer.

368
00:15:50,547 --> 00:15:52,506
The real killer is stress.

369
00:15:52,507 --> 00:15:54,299
Okay, sure, fine.

370
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,635
Oppenheimer famously said he regretted

371
00:15:56,636 --> 00:15:58,679
building the atom bomb
and died in despair,

372
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,639
but what the fuck does that
have to do with anything?

373
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,475
Oppenheimer. What a
self-obsessed little bitch.

374
00:16:03,476 --> 00:16:06,437
What are we supposed to do,
huh? What are we supposed to do?

375
00:16:06,438 --> 00:16:09,273
Fucking Gilfoyle.
We'll just call up AT&T

376
00:16:09,274 --> 00:16:11,442
and say that our network is so good

377
00:16:11,443 --> 00:16:13,861
that it'll eventually become
some doomsday device,

378
00:16:13,862 --> 00:16:17,114
and we have no moral
option but to destroy it

379
00:16:17,115 --> 00:16:19,783
before we let you release it? I mean...

380
00:16:19,784 --> 00:16:21,786
We're not doing it! We're not.

381
00:16:22,746 --> 00:16:24,997
- We're not.
- Hey, Richard.

382
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:29,961
Whatever you think is best,
that's what we're gonna do.

383
00:16:32,797 --> 00:16:34,924
I mean, they just put up the billboard.

384
00:16:36,009 --> 00:16:38,470
She's a beauty, right?

385
00:16:49,314 --> 00:16:51,483
Fu... ! Sorry, guys.

386
00:16:52,066 --> 00:16:54,401
- Gilfoyle's right.
- Seriously?

387
00:16:54,402 --> 00:16:57,112
We're seriously doing this?
We're canceling the launch?

388
00:16:57,113 --> 00:17:01,283
Well, no. Uh, ha, that's not enough.

389
00:17:01,284 --> 00:17:03,952
Our network is dangerous.

390
00:17:03,953 --> 00:17:06,288
If we cancel it or shut it down,

391
00:17:06,289 --> 00:17:08,165
then others will try to copy

392
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,834
or reverse engineer
everything that we've built.

393
00:17:10,835 --> 00:17:12,294
It's like...

394
00:17:12,295 --> 00:17:13,962
It's like the four-minute mile.

395
00:17:13,963 --> 00:17:15,672
Everybody thought it was impossible,

396
00:17:15,673 --> 00:17:16,882
until someone did it,

397
00:17:16,883 --> 00:17:18,967
and then everybody started doing it

398
00:17:18,968 --> 00:17:21,012
because they knew it could be done.

399
00:17:21,513 --> 00:17:23,430
Right. Roger Bannister.

400
00:17:23,431 --> 00:17:25,724
Now, imagine he'd gone
into cardiac arrest

401
00:17:25,725 --> 00:17:28,185
and evacuated on himself and died.

402
00:17:28,186 --> 00:17:30,312
And as he lay there
with his prolapsed anus

403
00:17:30,313 --> 00:17:32,689
peeking beneath the running
shorts on his newly dead body,

404
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:34,066
the crowd jeered and grimaced.

405
00:17:34,067 --> 00:17:35,860
That is what has to happen to us.

406
00:17:36,778 --> 00:17:38,946
We have to shit ourselves to death.

407
00:17:38,947 --> 00:17:40,656
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

408
00:17:40,657 --> 00:17:41,824
He's right.

409
00:17:41,825 --> 00:17:44,701
Our launch has to fail, publicly...

410
00:17:44,702 --> 00:17:46,203
and spectacularly.

411
00:17:46,204 --> 00:17:48,873
Are you dumbfucks
listening to yourselves?

412
00:17:49,374 --> 00:17:51,250
Because I am,

413
00:17:51,251 --> 00:17:53,126
and you are dumb.

414
00:17:53,127 --> 00:17:54,671
And fucks.

415
00:17:55,338 --> 00:17:57,714
Gilfoyle is willing to destroy
everything we've built

416
00:17:57,715 --> 00:17:59,633
just to prevent me from having money!

417
00:18:00,885 --> 00:18:02,118
Interesting.

418
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:03,929
Is that Dinesh's Tesla?

419
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,557
What?

420
00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:10,602
- There's no one in it.
- Correct.

421
00:18:10,603 --> 00:18:13,355
You have the Tesla
mobile app on your phone,

422
00:18:13,356 --> 00:18:17,484
which communicates over
the Pied Piper network.

423
00:18:17,485 --> 00:18:20,612
A few hours ago, I tasked said network

424
00:18:20,613 --> 00:18:24,533
with providing me your
TLS encryption key,

425
00:18:24,534 --> 00:18:26,035
which it just gave me.

426
00:18:26,578 --> 00:18:29,162
To verify that that key was correct,

427
00:18:29,163 --> 00:18:31,832
I decided to autodrive your car

428
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,917
to the car wash on El Camino.

429
00:18:33,918 --> 00:18:36,712
It appears the key was correct,

430
00:18:36,713 --> 00:18:38,130
no?

431
00:18:38,131 --> 00:18:39,590
Be careful, Charlotte.

432
00:18:39,591 --> 00:18:41,754
What encryption does Tesla use?

433
00:18:41,755 --> 00:18:44,595
Curve 25519,

434
00:18:44,596 --> 00:18:46,722
the most secure...

435
00:18:46,723 --> 00:18:49,892
discrete log parameter there is.

436
00:18:49,893 --> 00:18:51,268
Not anymore.

437
00:18:51,269 --> 00:18:54,146
Our network just blew it
apart like a prolapsed anus.

438
00:18:54,147 --> 00:18:57,317
In only two hours and 47 minutes.

439
00:18:57,901 --> 00:19:00,402
- The prosecution rests.
- Okay, Dinesh,

440
00:19:00,403 --> 00:19:02,613
they're right. We have to fail,

441
00:19:02,614 --> 00:19:04,656
and it has to look like an accident,

442
00:19:04,657 --> 00:19:07,159
or else we could all go to prison.

443
00:19:09,495 --> 00:19:12,247
- No, I cannot do it.
- Of course you can.

444
00:19:12,248 --> 00:19:15,751
Your entire life has
prepared you to publicly fail.

445
00:19:15,752 --> 00:19:17,794
You're just failing
to see that right now.

446
00:19:17,795 --> 00:19:21,089
Don't insult me. I can fail
circles around you losers.

447
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:22,466
But will I?

448
00:19:22,467 --> 00:19:24,968
I'm gonna be honest with you.

449
00:19:24,969 --> 00:19:26,678
No offense to me,

450
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:29,598
but I am greedy and unreliable,

451
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:30,975
bordering on piece of shit.

452
00:19:31,643 --> 00:19:33,018
If there is a chance

453
00:19:33,019 --> 00:19:36,563
to stop you guys from stopping
you guys, I will do it.

454
00:19:36,564 --> 00:19:38,482
I will sabotage your sabotage.

455
00:19:38,483 --> 00:19:41,318
So, if this company needs to fail

456
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:43,363
epically, like fucking fail...

457
00:19:45,323 --> 00:19:46,950
you need to do it without me.

458
00:19:47,617 --> 00:19:49,368
Revoke my permissions.

459
00:19:49,369 --> 00:19:50,953
Delete my PiperMail account.

460
00:19:50,954 --> 00:19:53,957
I will use Gmail like
a fucking basic bitch.

461
00:19:56,668 --> 00:19:59,836
Don't let me anywhere near that launch.

462
00:19:59,837 --> 00:20:02,756
I may beg, and I will lie to you.

463
00:20:02,757 --> 00:20:06,052
I cannot bribe you because
I don't have any money.

464
00:20:07,053 --> 00:20:09,805
But I am too much of a liability.

465
00:20:09,806 --> 00:20:13,225
That is the most courageous
act of cowardice I've ever seen.

466
00:20:13,226 --> 00:20:15,561
All this because of a fucking dot.

467
00:20:16,813 --> 00:20:19,857
Dinesh's car is at
the Wendy's drive-thru.

468
00:20:20,358 --> 00:20:21,441
Anybody hungry?

469
00:20:21,442 --> 00:20:22,484
They call it PiperNet,

470
00:20:22,485 --> 00:20:24,152
and it's coming to your phone.

471
00:20:24,153 --> 00:20:26,530
Tomorrow at noon, the Pied
Piper app will go live

472
00:20:26,531 --> 00:20:29,460
on the latest 5G-equipped
iOS and Android phones

473
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:31,528
in 10 major cities across the country.

474
00:20:31,529 --> 00:20:34,538
AT&T says, if things go as
planned, PiperNet could be

475
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:37,124
on more than a half billion
devices within a year.

476
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:40,752
And no one is more excited
than technology super fans,

477
00:20:40,753 --> 00:20:43,672
like the ones behind me...

478
00:20:43,673 --> 00:20:46,063
... who are camping
out all night to snag

479
00:20:46,064 --> 00:20:49,052
a limited edition Pied
Piper-equipped smartphone.

480
00:20:49,053 --> 00:20:51,513
If their enthusiasm
is anything to go by,

481
00:20:51,514 --> 00:20:54,391
then a lot more people
may soon be lining up

482
00:20:54,392 --> 00:20:56,768
to pay the piper.

483
00:20:56,769 --> 00:20:59,939
I'm Jim Gittman, KCTW.

484
00:21:01,858 --> 00:21:04,568
All right, thanks, everyone!
Appreciate y'all! Okay!

485
00:21:04,569 --> 00:21:07,071
I see you! I see you!

486
00:21:20,752 --> 00:21:23,336
Hey, does anyone want a bear claw?

487
00:21:23,337 --> 00:21:25,302
I just bought too many at the store,

488
00:21:25,303 --> 00:21:27,716
so I'm going around giving
them away if anybody wants

489
00:21:27,717 --> 00:21:29,593
- a bear claw or a cruller...
- Whoa.

490
00:21:29,594 --> 00:21:32,096
You got one of the Pied
Piper ratjacks made?

491
00:21:32,889 --> 00:21:35,057
Wait, there's a cool
nickname for the jackets?

492
00:21:35,058 --> 00:21:37,434
Yeah, you even got Dinesh embroidered.

493
00:21:37,435 --> 00:21:39,437
Oh, he's my favorite, too.

494
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:41,938
Wait.

495
00:21:41,939 --> 00:21:44,316
Oh my God. Holy shit!

496
00:21:44,317 --> 00:21:46,109
Dude, it's Dinesh!

497
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,612
Yeah, Dinesh. I'm Dinesh Chugtai.

498
00:21:48,613 --> 00:21:50,781
I'm the cofounder of Pied Piper,

499
00:21:50,782 --> 00:21:52,532
in an original ratjack.

500
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:53,784
I can't wait for tomorrow!

501
00:21:53,785 --> 00:21:55,702
Don't worry about tomorrow! Today!

502
00:21:55,703 --> 00:21:57,591
- Fuck tomorrow!
- Uh,

503
00:21:57,592 --> 00:22:00,665
- can I get a selfie?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

504
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,793
- Okay, thank you!
- Here we go.

505
00:22:04,253 --> 00:22:05,837
I am Pied Piper.

506
00:22:05,838 --> 00:22:09,092
- I am Pied Piper.
- I am Pied Piper.

507
00:22:09,801 --> 00:22:11,469
I am Pied Piper...

508
00:22:13,471 --> 00:22:16,389
- Are we set?
- Locked and loaded.

509
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:17,974
The script I wrote will push a new build

510
00:22:17,975 --> 00:22:20,645
from the supernode at the office
the second you step on stage.

511
00:22:21,395 --> 00:22:24,189
No one here will see
it. When we go live,

512
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:26,149
all the nodes should
start broadcasting noise

513
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,984
across common communication bands,

514
00:22:27,985 --> 00:22:30,070
jamming cell signals,
knocking out Bluetooth,

515
00:22:30,071 --> 00:22:32,824
and fucking up every GPS unit for miles.

516
00:22:33,366 --> 00:22:35,325
- Good.
- Yeah.

517
00:22:35,326 --> 00:22:37,328
They'll force us to shut it down...

518
00:22:38,162 --> 00:22:39,746
then it'll all be over.

519
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,334
Good.

520
00:22:44,335 --> 00:22:45,962
Yeah. Good.

521
00:22:46,754 --> 00:22:48,839
Fuck.

522
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,091
Richard? We're about to start.

523
00:22:51,092 --> 00:22:53,010
Yeah, let's go. Okay, here we go.

524
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,349
I am Pied Piper.

525
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:02,394
I am Pied Piper.

526
00:23:02,395 --> 00:23:05,148
I am Pied Piper.

527
00:23:06,315 --> 00:23:08,859
Hi. Uh, my name is Dinesh Chugtai.

528
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:12,154
I wanna make sure I am not on
the list for the launch today.

529
00:23:12,155 --> 00:23:15,702
Chugtai. Um... I don't
see your name here.

530
00:23:15,703 --> 00:23:17,492
Okay, that's great. Oh, uh,

531
00:23:17,493 --> 00:23:20,537
could you also make sure there
are no VIP lists I might be on?

532
00:23:20,538 --> 00:23:22,914
Chugtai. Spelled how it's pronounced.

533
00:23:22,915 --> 00:23:24,749
- Okay. Uh...
- "Chu",

534
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,876
and then "gtai".

535
00:23:25,877 --> 00:23:27,494
No, not here either.

536
00:23:27,495 --> 00:23:29,796
Oh, and these security guards?

537
00:23:29,797 --> 00:23:33,675
Are they your best guys?
Like, will they stop me?

538
00:23:33,676 --> 00:23:34,801
Would they fuck me up?

539
00:23:34,802 --> 00:23:36,303
- I'm sorry, we...
- Thank you so much.

540
00:23:36,304 --> 00:23:38,388
That's exactly the
response I was looking for.

541
00:23:38,389 --> 00:23:40,640
I feel very confident I
will not be getting into

542
00:23:40,641 --> 00:23:42,768
the launch today. Thank
you for not helping.

543
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,061
Don't let me through.

544
00:23:45,062 --> 00:23:47,190
We are Pied Piper!

545
00:23:52,737 --> 00:23:54,280
Woo!

546
00:23:56,657 --> 00:23:58,700
Yes, hello. Uh...

547
00:23:58,701 --> 00:24:01,745
I am Richard Hendricks, founder and CEO,

548
00:24:01,746 --> 00:24:03,997
and I am thrilled to welcome you all

549
00:24:03,998 --> 00:24:06,750
to the official launch of Pied Piper.

550
00:24:30,316 --> 00:24:32,442
- Hey, John.
- Yeah.

551
00:24:32,443 --> 00:24:34,444
Here's your hot water.

552
00:24:34,445 --> 00:24:36,072
Okay.

553
00:24:40,785 --> 00:24:42,119
Hey, Gabe?

554
00:24:42,787 --> 00:24:45,498
There's something weird here.

555
00:24:47,124 --> 00:24:48,793
What is it?

556
00:24:50,169 --> 00:24:52,462
The code they're about to launch...

557
00:24:52,463 --> 00:24:55,173
it isn't the build we shipped.

558
00:24:55,174 --> 00:24:57,677
Someone just pushed a new build.

559
00:25:00,638 --> 00:25:02,138
Hey, John?

560
00:25:02,139 --> 00:25:03,598
Yeah?

561
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:05,476
That's a mistake.

562
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:09,105
We should change it
back to the right code.

563
00:25:11,399 --> 00:25:12,775
Okay.

564
00:25:17,196 --> 00:25:18,738
Fast and powerful.

565
00:25:18,739 --> 00:25:20,978
Sounds a little bit like you,
Andre Iguodala.

566
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:22,987
- Yes!
- That's right, Richard Hendricks.

567
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:25,537
And as a member of the NBA's
all-defensive first team,

568
00:25:25,538 --> 00:25:27,455
I know a little something
about cybersecurity.

569
00:25:27,456 --> 00:25:30,875
Would you say that
Pied Piper is your MVP?

570
00:25:30,876 --> 00:25:32,836
"Most valuable phone"?

571
00:25:32,837 --> 00:25:35,006
Yeah, I would.

572
00:25:36,507 --> 00:25:38,175
Uh, hey, Dinesh?

573
00:25:39,218 --> 00:25:40,802
Gabe, what are you doing here?

574
00:25:40,803 --> 00:25:43,471
You weren't answering
your calls or texts,

575
00:25:43,472 --> 00:25:46,142
so I came here from the office.

576
00:25:46,684 --> 00:25:50,354
So, um, a weird version
of the software, uh...

577
00:25:53,524 --> 00:25:55,901
was put online, so, uh...

578
00:25:57,278 --> 00:25:58,528
So?

579
00:25:58,529 --> 00:26:00,865
So, I reverted it to
the version we shipped.

580
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:08,205
Oh, I have the original
weird one here...

581
00:26:09,498 --> 00:26:12,209
There's some photos of me in Hawaii.

582
00:26:14,628 --> 00:26:17,255
So, this was the version
that was about to be deployed,

583
00:26:17,256 --> 00:26:18,923
then you switched it,

584
00:26:18,924 --> 00:26:21,677
and now we're about to
launch the older version?

585
00:26:22,553 --> 00:26:24,512
Yes.

586
00:26:24,513 --> 00:26:27,057
So, if I do nothing,

587
00:26:27,058 --> 00:26:29,350
absolutely nothing...

588
00:26:29,351 --> 00:26:31,978
- Nothing?
- ... the "correct" version

589
00:26:31,979 --> 00:26:33,646
of the network would launch?

590
00:26:33,647 --> 00:26:36,775
Uh, what do you mean
by when you do that?

591
00:26:36,776 --> 00:26:38,943
- Just stretching my fingers.
- Oh.

592
00:26:38,944 --> 00:26:41,071
But before I go, can you tell me,

593
00:26:41,072 --> 00:26:42,429
who let the dogs out?

594
00:26:47,703 --> 00:26:50,414
Damn it! Okay, go. Thank you.

595
00:26:54,251 --> 00:26:56,419
Leave a message. Also,

596
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,714
fuck you, Dinesh.

597
00:27:03,135 --> 00:27:05,763
The supernode on the roof.

598
00:27:25,908 --> 00:27:27,700
Give it up for Menlo Bark!

599
00:27:27,701 --> 00:27:29,869
Weren't they fetching?

600
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:32,185
Fucking hell, who wrote this shit?

601
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,667
I...

602
00:27:35,668 --> 00:27:37,127
Guys! Comma.

603
00:27:37,128 --> 00:27:39,212
We have a huge fucking problem!

604
00:27:39,213 --> 00:27:41,131
Period. Fucking Gabe

605
00:27:41,132 --> 00:27:42,882
reverted to the old build!

606
00:27:42,883 --> 00:27:45,135
Exclamation point, exclamation point!

607
00:27:48,139 --> 00:27:50,974
I got a group text from Dinesh.

608
00:27:50,975 --> 00:27:54,018
"Guys, come on. Fun king games

609
00:27:54,019 --> 00:27:56,147
pervert Oldsmobile"?

610
00:27:56,856 --> 00:27:59,649
- What?
- Okay, so I've...

611
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:01,609
shown you our...

612
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:04,154
decentralized universal data exchange,

613
00:28:04,155 --> 00:28:06,447
our tamper-proof storage.

614
00:28:06,448 --> 00:28:08,700
I've shown you that you, and you alone,

615
00:28:08,701 --> 00:28:12,163
will control your personal
data and your identity.

616
00:28:18,335 --> 00:28:19,586
All...

617
00:28:19,587 --> 00:28:22,839
All of us here at Pied Piper have worked

618
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,509
so hard on this.

619
00:28:27,595 --> 00:28:30,805
We have given six sleepless,

620
00:28:30,806 --> 00:28:32,850
brutal years to this project,

621
00:28:33,851 --> 00:28:35,978
and I am...

622
00:28:36,812 --> 00:28:39,398
so proud of what we've done.

623
00:28:42,443 --> 00:28:44,485
Uh, so my mentor...

624
00:28:44,486 --> 00:28:46,738
... the late Peter Gregory, uh,

625
00:28:46,739 --> 00:28:49,575
put us on the path to
what we've created here.

626
00:28:50,451 --> 00:28:52,202
He called it,

627
00:28:52,203 --> 00:28:55,497
"the internet we deserve".

628
00:28:56,207 --> 00:28:59,125
We have fought every step of the way

629
00:28:59,126 --> 00:29:02,754
to bring you the greatest network

630
00:29:02,755 --> 00:29:06,758
ever made, ha. And in, uh...

631
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:09,678
five minutes, 42 seconds,

632
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:15,392
that fight is over.

633
00:30:05,067 --> 00:30:07,569
Son of a bitch.

634
00:30:08,946 --> 00:30:11,322
Dinesh, you fucking terrorist,

635
00:30:11,323 --> 00:30:12,532
what the fuck are you doing?

636
00:30:13,701 --> 00:30:14,867
Are you jerking off?

637
00:30:14,868 --> 00:30:16,953
Or did you do one push up?

638
00:30:16,954 --> 00:30:19,497
Quit being a fucking bitch.

639
00:30:19,498 --> 00:30:21,327
Let me then make clear

640
00:30:21,328 --> 00:30:22,792
that I am determined upon our...

641
00:30:24,795 --> 00:30:27,463
That's one small step for a man,

642
00:30:27,464 --> 00:30:30,216
one giant leap for mankind.

643
00:30:30,217 --> 00:30:32,176
Hello?

644
00:30:32,177 --> 00:30:33,469
Dinesh is where?

645
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:35,930
- Tell him to fuck off.
- You tell him.

646
00:30:35,931 --> 00:30:38,808
It's me! I'm here. I'm
merged and I can hear you.

647
00:30:38,809 --> 00:30:40,227
Hold on.

648
00:30:40,978 --> 00:30:43,062
- Hey.
- We're all merged in.

649
00:30:43,063 --> 00:30:45,273
Richard, you are doing a great job.

650
00:30:45,274 --> 00:30:47,817
Jared, shut up. Richard, turn around.

651
00:30:47,818 --> 00:30:49,486
I'm behind you.

652
00:30:50,446 --> 00:30:53,823
Dinesh says that Gabe reverted
us back to the prior build

653
00:30:53,824 --> 00:30:55,241
from the supernode at the office.

654
00:30:55,242 --> 00:30:58,453
I cannot verify this because
I'm not at a supernode.

655
00:30:58,454 --> 00:31:00,830
I'm across the stage
from you, as you can see.

656
00:31:00,831 --> 00:31:03,916
But Dinesh is. He's on the roof.

657
00:31:03,917 --> 00:31:06,294
He wants me to give him back
his permissions to deploy.

658
00:31:06,295 --> 00:31:08,421
So I can push out the right build.

659
00:31:08,422 --> 00:31:10,423
The wrong... The build, guys!

660
00:31:10,424 --> 00:31:12,467
The build we talked
about! The build that

661
00:31:12,468 --> 00:31:14,510
saves the world, but makes me poor!

662
00:31:14,511 --> 00:31:16,554
Question is, do we believe him?

663
00:31:16,555 --> 00:31:19,766
In fairness, there are a lot
of reasons not to trust him,

664
00:31:19,767 --> 00:31:21,392
such as he told us not to trust him.

665
00:31:21,393 --> 00:31:23,186
- Believe me!
- But do we trust that?

666
00:31:23,187 --> 00:31:25,188
For once, I wanna do the right thing!

667
00:31:25,189 --> 00:31:27,315
Richard, I'm gonna need an answer.

668
00:31:27,316 --> 00:31:30,568
- I don't have much time.
- The fate of the world literally relies on this.

669
00:31:30,569 --> 00:31:32,653
Richard, it's time.

670
00:31:32,654 --> 00:31:34,197
- Come on!
- Okay.

671
00:31:34,198 --> 00:31:38,068
- Richard, we need an answer.
- Ladies and gentlemen, we are at...

672
00:31:38,911 --> 00:31:41,371
Ten, nine,

673
00:31:41,372 --> 00:31:43,581
eight,

674
00:31:43,582 --> 00:31:45,541
seven, six...

675
00:31:45,542 --> 00:31:47,753
- Fuck it. Dinesh, you're in.
- ... five,

676
00:31:49,713 --> 00:31:51,297
- ... four...
- Oh.

677
00:31:51,298 --> 00:31:53,049
... three,

678
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,884
two, one!

679
00:31:54,885 --> 00:31:58,012
Ladies and gentlemen,
Pied Piper network...

680
00:31:58,013 --> 00:32:00,390
... is officially live!

681
00:32:02,059 --> 00:32:05,562
The balloons are falling. Is
that a good sign or a bad sign?

682
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:09,232
Uh...

683
00:32:13,779 --> 00:32:16,239
The app is now available!

684
00:32:19,743 --> 00:32:22,413
- We did it!
- Where are you guys?

685
00:32:23,914 --> 00:32:26,374
Communications should be
going haywire. Are they?

686
00:32:26,375 --> 00:32:28,835
I can still hear you, so
phones must be working.

687
00:32:28,836 --> 00:32:31,421
Traffic is moving, so
GPS must be working.

688
00:32:31,422 --> 00:32:32,630
He's right.

689
00:32:32,631 --> 00:32:35,049
GPS says I'm here, standing next to you,

690
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:36,643
which seems to be accurate.

691
00:32:36,644 --> 00:32:38,219
Dinesh, you fucked us.

692
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,054
No, he didn't. We are generating noise.

693
00:32:40,055 --> 00:32:42,515
- Oh, okay. Sorry, Dinesh.
- You're good.

694
00:32:42,516 --> 00:32:44,308
I'd expect me to fuck us, too.

695
00:32:44,309 --> 00:32:46,561
Problem. We haven't
raised the noise far enough

696
00:32:46,562 --> 00:32:47,728
to drown out even Bluetooth.

697
00:32:47,729 --> 00:32:49,647
Okay, so we're generating noise,

698
00:32:49,648 --> 00:32:51,631
but just not enough to
interfere with anything?

699
00:32:51,632 --> 00:32:54,277
Is this gonna work? Did we
just make billions of dollars?!

700
00:32:54,278 --> 00:32:56,529
This wouldn't be happening if
we had had time to test things.

701
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:58,906
Fucking kidding me? We failed at failing?

702
00:32:58,907 --> 00:33:00,825
Wait, why are they barking?

703
00:33:00,826 --> 00:33:02,785
Oh shit.

704
00:33:02,786 --> 00:33:04,954
Think we might be creating
interference that's causing

705
00:33:04,955 --> 00:33:06,706
the speakers in the phones to resonate.

706
00:33:06,707 --> 00:33:08,124
And that's what bugging the dogs?

707
00:33:08,125 --> 00:33:11,043
No. Dogs shouldn't be
bothered by that frequency.

708
00:33:11,044 --> 00:33:13,337
Well, then, what the
fuck are they barking at?

709
00:33:22,681 --> 00:33:26,018
Please, ladies and
gentlemen, please stay calm!

710
00:33:26,935 --> 00:33:29,145
Don't panic!

711
00:33:33,859 --> 00:33:36,528
Dear sweet mother of God.

712
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:39,989
What have we done?

713
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:42,123
In a fairy tale turned nightmare

714
00:33:42,124 --> 00:33:45,244
come to life, thousands of
rats streamed onto the streets

715
00:33:45,245 --> 00:33:48,674
- of San Francisco today.
- Pied Piper's phones broadcasting

716
00:33:48,675 --> 00:33:50,833
intense ultrasonic sounds

717
00:33:50,834 --> 00:33:52,960
that began repelling the rats.

718
00:33:52,961 --> 00:33:56,172
The streets of Seattle became
the streets of Sea-rat-tle,

719
00:33:56,173 --> 00:33:57,799
and everyone was sleepless.

720
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,842
Giants fans going home happy today

721
00:33:59,843 --> 00:34:02,220
as the Cubs go down swinging to the...

722
00:34:02,221 --> 00:34:03,679
Holy shit!

723
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,973
They're calling it "Rat-mageddon". Yeah.

724
00:34:05,974 --> 00:34:08,768
Except in New York, where
they're calling it Wednesday.

725
00:34:12,981 --> 00:34:14,982
They literally became the Pied Piper.

726
00:34:14,983 --> 00:34:16,734
I mean, you can't make that up.

727
00:34:16,735 --> 00:34:18,987
Yeah, maybe you couldn't...

728
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:21,365
but I could.

729
00:34:22,282 --> 00:34:23,991
Oh, for fuck's sake.

730
00:34:23,992 --> 00:34:26,702
When you think about a lot
of the failures in tech...

731
00:34:26,703 --> 00:34:29,956
Pets.com, Theranos, WeWork...

732
00:34:29,957 --> 00:34:33,501
Pied Piper really is right
at the top of that list.

733
00:34:33,502 --> 00:34:37,046
Pied Piper is just a
millstone around AT&T's neck!

734
00:34:37,047 --> 00:34:39,298
I say dump it! Dump it now!

735
00:34:39,299 --> 00:34:42,677
I lost so much fucking
money with those guys.

736
00:34:42,678 --> 00:34:45,471
- I got rat-fucked.
- _

737
00:34:45,472 --> 00:34:46,681
That's a pun.

738
00:34:46,682 --> 00:34:48,558
I made it all back though.
Sweet investment

739
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:50,727
in the hair transplant sector.

740
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,380
What?

741
00:34:54,381 --> 00:34:57,784
Rats, ah, yes, we
have some of them here.

742
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,848
Figuratively.

743
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:03,018
They are dealt with.

744
00:35:04,032 --> 00:35:06,576
And so, effective immediately,

745
00:35:06,577 --> 00:35:08,452
I am shutting down Pied Piper,

746
00:35:08,453 --> 00:35:10,162
deleting its code repositories,

747
00:35:10,163 --> 00:35:13,165
and liquidating its remaining assets.

748
00:35:13,166 --> 00:35:15,918
All right. That's our statement.

749
00:35:15,919 --> 00:35:17,753
We will not be taking any further...

750
00:35:17,754 --> 00:35:20,840
Can I just say that I am just...

751
00:35:20,841 --> 00:35:23,718
truly, deeply sorry.

752
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:26,596
Uh, this should never have been built.

753
00:35:26,597 --> 00:35:30,601
It is... technically
flawed to its very core.

754
00:35:32,394 --> 00:35:34,646
And we should all remember that...

755
00:35:35,564 --> 00:35:37,733
forevermore.

756
00:35:38,358 --> 00:35:40,610
Sorry.

757
00:35:43,071 --> 00:35:45,573
Obviously, Mr. Hendricks
doesn't mean that in any

758
00:35:45,574 --> 00:35:49,578
legally binding or actionable
way. Get a life, guys.

759
00:35:51,306 --> 00:35:52,622
It's weird.

760
00:35:52,623 --> 00:35:56,358
It really seemed like Pied
Piper was going to work.

761
00:35:56,359 --> 00:35:58,383
_

762
00:35:58,384 --> 00:36:01,035
Something doesn't add up.

763
00:36:04,694 --> 00:36:06,511
So, I did the right thing,

764
00:36:06,512 --> 00:36:08,495
I helped save the world,

765
00:36:08,496 --> 00:36:10,438
my legs are still super sore,

766
00:36:10,439 --> 00:36:13,150
and my reward is that I'm poor.

767
00:36:16,021 --> 00:36:18,314
What are you gonna do?

768
00:36:18,315 --> 00:36:20,524
Not sure. Been thinking
about teaching...

769
00:36:20,525 --> 00:36:21,985
No, not you.

770
00:36:25,504 --> 00:36:27,404
Oh, uh...

771
00:36:27,405 --> 00:36:29,472
I think I might disappear for a bit.

772
00:36:29,473 --> 00:36:30,872
Maybe travel.

773
00:36:30,873 --> 00:36:32,731
Yeah, I might travel, too.

774
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:34,317
Where were you thinking?

775
00:36:35,207 --> 00:36:37,625
It may help if, at
least for the time being,

776
00:36:37,626 --> 00:36:40,002
you pretend to be mad at me.

777
00:36:40,003 --> 00:36:42,213
Look, Richard, I was a world
theater minor at Vassar,

778
00:36:42,214 --> 00:36:46,217
but that is one Javanese shadow
play that I cannot perform.

779
00:36:49,009 --> 00:36:51,659
Come on, guys, let's cheer up.

780
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:54,019
I mean, we set out to build

781
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:57,129
the best thing ever built,
and that's what we did,

782
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:58,989
right?

783
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:00,575
We succeeded.

784
00:37:01,592 --> 00:37:03,409
And who can say

785
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:05,620
that they literally saved the world?

786
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:08,531
- Right?
- Not us.

787
00:37:08,532 --> 00:37:10,658
'Cause we can't tell anyone what we did.

788
00:37:10,659 --> 00:37:13,035
Right. Not out loud, but...

789
00:37:13,036 --> 00:37:15,747
- You know.
- Silence is on brand for me.

790
00:37:16,623 --> 00:37:18,500
Good luck, Dinesh.

791
00:37:22,212 --> 00:37:23,714
On the bright side...

792
00:37:28,844 --> 00:37:31,345
I found another box of these.

793
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,769
Well, uh...

794
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:42,398
I was, I was a little
bit embarrassed, ha.

795
00:37:42,399 --> 00:37:44,650
Uh, so I just, uh,

796
00:37:44,651 --> 00:37:47,653
went off the grid for
a bit. I-I-I traveled.

797
00:37:47,654 --> 00:37:50,531
I went to Tibet, actually,
to try and find Erlich,

798
00:37:50,532 --> 00:37:52,701
but, uh, he was gone.

799
00:37:53,452 --> 00:37:56,037
And then, I came back,

800
00:37:56,038 --> 00:37:59,915
but no one really wanted to
hire the guy behind Pied Piper.

801
00:37:59,916 --> 00:38:02,084
Uh, however,

802
00:38:02,085 --> 00:38:04,755
my best friend did hire me,

803
00:38:05,422 --> 00:38:08,090
and now I am the...

804
00:38:08,091 --> 00:38:10,801
Gavin Belson Professor

805
00:38:10,802 --> 00:38:14,263
of, uh, Ethics in Technology
at Stanford University.

806
00:38:14,264 --> 00:38:16,766
My name is, uh, Nelson Bighetti,

807
00:38:16,767 --> 00:38:19,978
and I'm the president of Stamford.

808
00:38:22,022 --> 00:38:23,272
Stanford.

809
00:38:23,273 --> 00:38:27,151
You graduates have a
lot of responsibility.

810
00:38:27,152 --> 00:38:31,114
Finishing the important
work of movements such as...

811
00:38:32,115 --> 00:38:34,700
"pound Met double zero",

812
00:38:34,701 --> 00:38:36,619
and "title icks".

813
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:39,747
So, I think I know, but-but
why do they call you Big Head?

814
00:38:39,748 --> 00:38:41,832
Oh, yeah, just, you know,

815
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:44,376
boys being boys. Making fun of my,

816
00:38:44,377 --> 00:38:45,962
my big old dome.

817
00:38:46,671 --> 00:38:50,008
It's not because your
last name is Big-hetti?

818
00:38:57,682 --> 00:39:00,810
I'm the cofounder of Newell
Road Strategic Technologies,

819
00:39:00,811 --> 00:39:04,438
one of the largest cybersecurity
firms in the Bay Area.

820
00:39:04,439 --> 00:39:06,398
I am the cofounder of

821
00:39:06,399 --> 00:39:09,110
Newell Road Strategic Technologies,

822
00:39:09,111 --> 00:39:12,571
- one of the largest cyber...
- I literally just said that.

823
00:39:12,572 --> 00:39:15,074
- ... security firms...
- I just said that.

824
00:39:15,075 --> 00:39:17,660
- You heard me say that.
- ... in the Bay Area.

825
00:39:17,661 --> 00:39:19,912
Things are better when I say them.

826
00:39:19,913 --> 00:39:22,164
Plus, they're definitely
going to edit you out.

827
00:39:22,165 --> 00:39:25,000
If they're not gonna use it, why
would they use it? That has...

828
00:39:25,001 --> 00:39:27,336
Why don't you tell them how you
bought the house next to mine

829
00:39:27,337 --> 00:39:30,506
- because you love me so much.
- Okay,

830
00:39:30,507 --> 00:39:32,508
fuck you.

831
00:39:32,509 --> 00:39:34,511
How's it going, guys?

832
00:39:35,178 --> 00:39:37,179
Meeting time.

833
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:39,849
- We have a meeting.
- Mandatory.

834
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:42,143
What do I do now? I, uh, I work for

835
00:39:42,144 --> 00:39:44,019
a non-profit in DC.

836
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:46,856
It's a... it's a think
tank, and-and we just...

837
00:39:46,857 --> 00:39:49,401
think about... stuff, you know.

838
00:39:49,985 --> 00:39:51,902
So, the NSA.

839
00:39:51,903 --> 00:39:54,697
The NSA? No, no, no.

840
00:39:54,698 --> 00:39:57,659
Farthest thing from the NSA.

841
00:39:58,535 --> 00:40:01,412
God. The NSA. That's...

842
00:40:01,413 --> 00:40:03,372
That's a really weird question to ask.

843
00:40:03,373 --> 00:40:04,998
Okay, Jell-O.

844
00:40:04,999 --> 00:40:08,836
- I love working with the elderly.
- One, two, one, two.

845
00:40:08,837 --> 00:40:11,714
It's like I get to
have a bunch of parents

846
00:40:11,715 --> 00:40:13,382
and also be their parent.

847
00:40:13,383 --> 00:40:16,218
No! No, no, no! Martin, Martin!

848
00:40:16,219 --> 00:40:17,761
She only has eyes for you.

849
00:40:17,762 --> 00:40:20,057
We were dancing as
girlfriends, that's it.

850
00:40:20,058 --> 00:40:22,975
This fall, we actually
had a herpes epidemic

851
00:40:22,976 --> 00:40:26,478
among the residents, which
is bad medically, but...

852
00:40:26,479 --> 00:40:29,815
from another perspective,
it's kind of touching.

853
00:40:29,816 --> 00:40:32,569
Okay, we're on our way to the hostel.

854
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:38,575
God, I haven't been
there in such a long time.

855
00:40:39,868 --> 00:40:41,535
It was just an...

856
00:40:41,536 --> 00:40:44,372
it was an incredible
time in my life, you know?

857
00:40:44,873 --> 00:40:46,707
I never really thought that I would have

858
00:40:46,708 --> 00:40:49,043
a group of male friends.

859
00:40:49,044 --> 00:40:52,297
You know, men just seem
kinda mean and hard, but...

860
00:40:53,131 --> 00:40:55,090
these guys were as sweet

861
00:40:55,091 --> 00:40:57,426
and soft as rotten fruit.

862
00:40:57,427 --> 00:40:59,011
You got your book?

863
00:40:59,012 --> 00:41:00,721
Prince of Puget Sound?

864
00:41:00,722 --> 00:41:03,266
Oh, Judy!

865
00:41:07,562 --> 00:41:09,271
Hey, man.

866
00:41:09,272 --> 00:41:10,607
Hey, man.

867
00:41:12,251 --> 00:41:13,336
You okay?

868
00:41:14,819 --> 00:41:16,111
Yeah.

869
00:41:16,112 --> 00:41:17,780
I haven't seen you in forever.

870
00:41:17,781 --> 00:41:19,240
I saw you last weekend.

871
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:21,910
You look great.

872
00:41:23,495 --> 00:41:24,787
Is that...

873
00:41:24,788 --> 00:41:26,330
is that a woman's scent?

874
00:41:26,331 --> 00:41:28,458
No, it's unisex.

875
00:41:29,717 --> 00:41:30,907
Big Head?

876
00:41:30,908 --> 00:41:32,535
Hey, Nelson.

877
00:41:35,507 --> 00:41:37,591
I work a lot with people
who have dementia,

878
00:41:37,592 --> 00:41:38,766
and I just want you to know,

879
00:41:38,767 --> 00:41:40,667
it doesn't have to be a horror show.

880
00:41:40,668 --> 00:41:41,943
Oh, cool.

881
00:41:41,944 --> 00:41:44,306
- Well hey, we're all here.
- Let's go.

882
00:41:44,307 --> 00:41:46,475
Let's go see Jian-Yang, heh.

883
00:41:48,478 --> 00:41:50,312
- You okay? Richard!
- Fine.

884
00:41:53,692 --> 00:41:55,776
Uh... , hi there. Is, uh,

885
00:41:55,777 --> 00:41:57,778
is Jian-Yang here?

886
00:41:57,779 --> 00:42:00,948
Does he live here? We're...
we're all old friends of his.

887
00:42:00,949 --> 00:42:02,366
No, I'm sorry.

888
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:05,744
I bought the house years
ago from his estate.

889
00:42:05,745 --> 00:42:07,831
Estate?

890
00:42:08,373 --> 00:42:10,165
I'm sorry to be the
one to tell you this,

891
00:42:10,166 --> 00:42:12,335
but Jian-Yang's dead.

892
00:42:17,173 --> 00:42:18,507
Uh...

893
00:42:18,508 --> 00:42:20,759
Okay, so he's dead. What do we do?

894
00:42:24,889 --> 00:42:27,892
It's different, but also the same.

895
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:29,994
Hey, Gilfoyle.

896
00:42:30,895 --> 00:42:33,897
That's your horrible corner.
It looks much better now.

897
00:42:33,898 --> 00:42:35,357
Changed a little bit.

898
00:42:35,358 --> 00:42:36,860
They fixed my hole.

899
00:42:38,528 --> 00:42:40,571
Don't do it again.

900
00:42:40,572 --> 00:42:42,197
No, I wouldn't. Obviously.

901
00:42:42,198 --> 00:42:43,699
I was emotionally charged.

902
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,827
Oh, the drapes.

903
00:42:47,912 --> 00:42:49,831
Oh, that's a playful linen.

904
00:42:50,707 --> 00:42:53,375
- Hi. I used to live here...
- Hey.

905
00:42:53,376 --> 00:42:54,918
... back when I was poor.

906
00:42:54,919 --> 00:42:57,088
- Cool.
- No offense.

907
00:42:57,756 --> 00:42:59,382
None taken, I guess.

908
00:43:01,176 --> 00:43:03,385
- President Bighetti?
- Whoa!

909
00:43:03,386 --> 00:43:06,221
- How did... how'd you know my name?
- I go to Stanford.

910
00:43:06,222 --> 00:43:07,973
Oh, no way! I work at Stanford.

911
00:43:07,974 --> 00:43:10,768
- I'm the president.
- Yeah, I know.

912
00:43:10,769 --> 00:43:12,811
What are you doing here?

913
00:43:12,812 --> 00:43:15,689
Um, I don't know. I think
'cause Jian-Yang died?

914
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:18,400
- I'm not sure.
- Who's that? Okay.

915
00:43:18,401 --> 00:43:20,819
So weird we're all back here.

916
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:24,156
Except for Jian-Yang because he's dead.

917
00:43:24,157 --> 00:43:25,574
And Erlich.

918
00:43:25,575 --> 00:43:27,159
Has anyone talked to Erlich?

919
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,870
Nope. No. But wherever he is,

920
00:43:29,871 --> 00:43:32,081
I hope he hasn't blown
through all that money.

921
00:43:32,082 --> 00:43:34,375
He definitely has.

922
00:43:34,376 --> 00:43:36,585
Yeah, I'm sure he has.

923
00:43:42,801 --> 00:43:44,760
We're looking for Erlich Bachman.

924
00:43:44,761 --> 00:43:47,096
In the other village,
they said that he was here.

925
00:43:47,097 --> 00:43:48,680
Is-is Erlich Bachman here?

926
00:43:48,681 --> 00:43:52,267
He's here? He's that way?

927
00:43:56,648 --> 00:43:59,274
- It's up here?
- Erlich Bachman!

928
00:44:03,363 --> 00:44:05,489
So, this is Erlich Bachman's house?

929
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:07,659
- Erlich Bachman!
- Fantastic.

930
00:44:14,124 --> 00:44:16,793
We're just here to see Erlich Bachman.

931
00:44:18,554 --> 00:44:20,139
Hello?

932
00:44:23,842 --> 00:44:25,635
Hello?

933
00:44:29,305 --> 00:44:32,267
Whoa, whoa, easy, easy.
We're-we're friends.

934
00:44:33,268 --> 00:44:35,937
Are you Erlich Bachman?

935
00:44:39,899 --> 00:44:42,443
Yes. I'm Errich Bachman.

936
00:44:42,444 --> 00:44:44,279
- I can show you ID.
- _

937
00:44:45,321 --> 00:44:48,031
That's my face. I was a-fat,

938
00:44:48,032 --> 00:44:50,617
but now, I'm a-not fat.

939
00:44:50,618 --> 00:44:53,830
I'm sorry, this is supposed to be you?

940
00:45:00,503 --> 00:45:02,045
I have an idea.

941
00:45:02,046 --> 00:45:04,298
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa...

942
00:45:04,299 --> 00:45:06,216
I'm making the world
a better place through

943
00:45:06,217 --> 00:45:08,385
an intelligent, semi-autonomous agent,

944
00:45:08,386 --> 00:45:10,721
powered by distributed,
DNA-based compute

945
00:45:10,722 --> 00:45:13,849
that automates personal
planning and scheduling.

946
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:16,059
Oh, bots. Sounds like an atrocity.

947
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:18,437
Let's just hope you have
better success than we did.

948
00:45:18,438 --> 00:45:20,522
Oh, what company did you have?

949
00:45:20,523 --> 00:45:22,441
Oh, here we go.

950
00:45:22,442 --> 00:45:24,693
Uh, Pied Piper.

951
00:45:24,694 --> 00:45:25,986
Yep.

952
00:45:25,987 --> 00:45:27,362
I'm unfamiliar...

953
00:45:27,363 --> 00:45:28,864
Rat invasion...

954
00:45:28,865 --> 00:45:31,408
We... we were a big failure.

955
00:45:31,409 --> 00:45:33,702
Eight billion dollar valuation,

956
00:45:33,703 --> 00:45:36,872
down to zero in one day.

957
00:45:36,873 --> 00:45:39,124
Was that, like, a social media company?

958
00:45:39,125 --> 00:45:41,645
- What? Pied Piper.
- Are you fucking with us?

959
00:45:42,962 --> 00:45:45,380
Thank you guys so much for your time.

960
00:45:45,381 --> 00:45:47,007
Hey, guys.

961
00:45:47,008 --> 00:45:48,885
Guess what I accidentally
brought in my bag.

962
00:45:53,139 --> 00:45:54,849
Oh, no way.

963
00:45:55,558 --> 00:45:58,018
Whoops.

964
00:45:58,019 --> 00:45:59,853
- We know this thing.
- Wow.

965
00:45:59,854 --> 00:46:01,980
I need a beer if we're gonna do this.

966
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:05,150
Richard, be careful.

967
00:46:05,151 --> 00:46:07,778
- Can I do it?
- Always blue!

968
00:46:07,779 --> 00:46:11,823
Always blue! Always blue!
Always blue! Always blue!

969
00:46:11,824 --> 00:46:13,909
Always blue! Always blue...

970
00:46:17,789 --> 00:46:19,581
- Okay.
- Always blue.

971
00:46:19,582 --> 00:46:21,583
Always blue! Always blue!

972
00:46:21,584 --> 00:46:22,918
Always blue!

973
00:46:22,919 --> 00:46:26,255
Always blue! Aah!

974
00:46:26,256 --> 00:46:28,799
Regrets? Uh...

975
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,426
No.

976
00:46:31,135 --> 00:46:33,595
No, I'm-I'm happy.

977
00:46:33,596 --> 00:46:35,556
And you don't, you don't feel bad

978
00:46:35,557 --> 00:46:37,099
that you never got to...

979
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:39,268
make the world a better place?

980
00:46:41,604 --> 00:46:42,939
Uh...

981
00:46:44,107 --> 00:46:46,276
I think we did okay.

982
00:46:50,363 --> 00:46:51,780
I...

983
00:46:51,781 --> 00:46:53,783
actually could, um...

984
00:46:55,076 --> 00:46:57,119
I... I still have it.

985
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:58,787
One copy of the...

986
00:46:58,788 --> 00:47:01,039
Pied Piper codebase.

987
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,458
I have it on a thumb drive.
I could show it to you.

988
00:47:03,459 --> 00:47:05,085
We won't...

989
00:47:05,086 --> 00:47:07,338
look into it, but, um...

990
00:47:08,339 --> 00:47:10,508
I just wanna show it to you.

991
00:47:16,222 --> 00:47:18,516
It's just got a couple things
on there that I think...

992
00:47:19,809 --> 00:47:21,310
I, honestly, this was like when

993
00:47:21,311 --> 00:47:23,478
we were coding the best we ever were,

994
00:47:23,479 --> 00:47:26,691
so some pieces of this thing are...

995
00:47:27,609 --> 00:47:29,777
sheer elegance.

996
00:47:30,278 --> 00:47:31,737
I wish I could show it to everybody

997
00:47:31,738 --> 00:47:33,990
because I wanna show it to my students.

998
00:47:35,241 --> 00:47:37,326
Not my class, but another...

999
00:47:37,327 --> 00:47:39,621
I know it was in the desk.

1000
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:41,830
Okay, this is weird.

1001
00:47:41,831 --> 00:47:44,499
Shit, okay.

1002
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,127
Where is it?

1003
00:47:50,923 --> 00:47:53,342
It's or... it's orange. It's this big.

1004
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:54,760
It's just a thumb drive.

1005
00:47:54,761 --> 00:47:58,639
So, is anyone... have any of
your crew seen it or anything?

1006
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,515
I mean... right here.

1007
00:48:00,516 --> 00:48:03,144
That's insa...

1008
00:48:04,687 --> 00:48:06,356
I had the...

1009
00:48:07,482 --> 00:48:09,692
It's gotta be in the desk.

1010
00:48:10,318 --> 00:48:11,860
Is it a problem?

1011
00:48:11,861 --> 00:48:14,655
Um, no, not a problem. Um...

1012
00:48:14,656 --> 00:48:16,866
It's just pretty
fascinating. Although...

1013
00:48:18,284 --> 00:48:20,411
if it isn't here...

1014
00:48:23,437 --> 00:48:25,064
where is it?
