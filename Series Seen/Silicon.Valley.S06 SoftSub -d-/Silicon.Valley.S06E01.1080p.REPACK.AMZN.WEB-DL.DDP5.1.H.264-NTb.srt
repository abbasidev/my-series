You wish to acquire
a company called Sliceline?

I will be taking on
a total engineering team

Well we thought the best way
to introduce the PiperNet

00:00:22,395 --> 00:00:24,395
would be through
the eight developers.

00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:29,311
We put this thing
on PiperNet...

Partnering with a company
of that size,

13
00:00:34,395 --> 00:00:36,019
this early, would put us
months ahead.

Knock 'em dead, Richard.

00:00:39,186 --> 00:00:41,895
Whatever you are doing,
stop it now.

You need to make a deal
with my companies.

Taking existing companies
and just calling them new

that's theft.

Why would they wanna help us?

They're not helping us,
they're attacking us.

No way.

they fucked you over.

to fuck them back?

Mr. Hendricks,
thank you for being here.

59
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:43,478
For the last three hours,
we've been asking

60
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:45,478
some prominent members
of your industry

61
00:02:45,561 --> 00:02:48,228
questions about the security
of their users' data.

62
00:02:48,311 --> 00:02:51,520
And while the gentlemen from
Facebook, Google, and Amazon

63
00:02:51,603 --> 00:02:53,937
have acknowledged some
egregious lapses in the past--

64
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:55,978
And Hooli, sir.
Hooli also acknowledged

65
00:02:56,061 --> 00:02:58,311
some spectacular
lapses.

66
00:02:58,395 --> 00:02:59,853
Yes.

67
00:02:59,937 --> 00:03:01,353
As I was saying,

68
00:03:01,436 --> 00:03:03,770
these fine folks have
been assuring us all that

69
00:03:03,853 --> 00:03:05,561
their oversights
are behind them,

70
00:03:05,645 --> 00:03:07,103
and that they
are the best people

71

to protect
their users' privacy.

72
00:03:09,061 --> 00:03:11,269
But my colleague,
Senator Shizaki

73
00:03:11,353 --> 00:03:13,061
of the great state of Hawaii,

74
00:03:13,144 --> 00:03:15,770
suggested that you might
have a different view.

75
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:16,895
Senator?

76
00:03:16,978 --> 00:03:18,687
Thank you,
Chairman Hubbard.

77
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:21,520
Mr. Hendricks and his
company, Pied Piper,

00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,687

81
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:30,269
I have asked him to deliver
a statement here today.

82
00:03:30,853 --> 00:03:32,603
Mr. Hendricks?

83
00:03:33,478 --> 00:03:34,937
Yes.

84
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,269
Mr. Hendricks, now would be
the time for that statement.

85
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,687
Okay.

86
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:43,061
I probably should've
gotten these out before.

87
00:03:43,144 --> 00:03:46,061
He looks like a child
in a custody hearing.

88
00:03:46,144 --> 00:03:47,895
But, like,
you don't feel
sorry for him.

89
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:49,561
You just want him to go away

-and not have
any parents at all.

-Hold on.

99
00:04:09,061 --> 00:04:10,436
Uh, basically,

100
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,478
it-it is a program...

101
00:04:13,561 --> 00:04:15,436
that i-i-it's kinda...

102
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,228

think better on my feet.

00:04:19,311 --> 00:04:21,603
So, a lot of people...

Oh! Okay.

107
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,019
I'm sorry. Does this come out?

108
00:04:33,103 --> 00:04:34,561
Perfect.

109
00:04:34,645 --> 00:04:36,061
-(whispers): Fuck.
-Richard (on TV): Okay, so,

110
00:04:36,144 --> 00:04:38,269
these people up here, right?

111
00:04:38,353 --> 00:04:41,353
You want to rein them in,
but you can't.

112
00:04:42,019 --> 00:04:46,770
Uh, Facebook owns
80% of mobile social traffic.

113
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:49,978
Google owns 92% of search,

114
00:04:50,061 --> 00:04:51,520
and Amazon Web Services

115
00:04:51,603 --> 00:04:55,937
is bigger than their next
four competitors combined.

116
00:04:56,019 --> 00:04:57,436
And they will be
even more robust

117
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,978
once the Hooli merger
is complete.

118
00:04:59,061 --> 00:05:01,311
Richard:
Ah, see! Look, there!

119
00:05:01,395 --> 00:05:03,436
Even Hooli can't survive
these monopolies.

120
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,770
No one can!

121
00:05:05,853 --> 00:05:08,103
They track our every move,

122
00:05:08,186 --> 00:05:11,186
they monitor every
moment in our lives,

123
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:14,311
and-and they exploit
our data for profit.

124
00:05:14,895 --> 00:05:17,853
(laughs) And you can ask them
all the questions you want,

125
00:05:17,937 --> 00:05:20,978
but they're not gonna change,
they don't have to.

126
00:05:21,061 --> 00:05:23,269
These companies are kings,

127
00:05:23,353 --> 00:05:25,269
and they rule over
kingdoms far larger

128
00:05:25,353 --> 00:05:28,019
than any nation
in human history.

129
00:05:28,103 --> 00:05:30,687
They won, we lost.

130
00:05:31,395 --> 00:05:32,645
So, why are you here?

131
00:05:32,728 --> 00:05:34,978
Because look at where we are.

132
00:05:35,061 --> 00:05:37,770
-Yeah? We are in the seat
of the US government--
-Mr. Hendricks?

133
00:05:37,853 --> 00:05:38,978
I'm okay. I've got it now.

134
00:05:39,061 --> 00:05:41,144
We are in the seat
of the US government,

135
00:05:41,228 --> 00:05:43,978
a government that
was founded by people

136
00:05:44,061 --> 00:05:47,436
who were, at one point,
ruled by kings
they couldn't overthrow.

137
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,520
So, what did they do, right?
They started over.

138
00:05:49,603 --> 00:05:51,395
They came here,
to the New World.

139
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:54,978
-World 2.0, version 1776.
-(murmuring)

140
00:05:55,603 --> 00:05:56,728
And the way we win

141
00:05:56,812 --> 00:05:59,728
is by creating a new,

142
00:05:59,812 --> 00:06:02,395
democratic,
decentralized Internet,

143
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:06,144
one where the behavior
of companies like this

144
00:06:06,228 --> 00:06:09,103
will be impossible, forever.

145
00:06:09,186 --> 00:06:11,353
One where it is the users,

146
00:06:11,436 --> 00:06:12,812
not the kings,

147
00:06:12,895 --> 00:06:14,978
who have sovereign
control over their data.

148
00:06:15,061 --> 00:06:17,853
This, I promise to you:
I will help you end this tyranny

149
00:06:17,937 --> 00:06:21,061
by building an Internet that is

150
00:06:21,144 --> 00:06:24,019
of the people, by the people,
and for the people,

151
00:06:24,103 --> 00:06:25,311
so help me God.

-Right.

Uh, yes, Colin.
No, I do. Um...

237
00:09:46,812 --> 00:09:49,687
Sorry. Okay. Uh, cheers.

238
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:52,353
Saw you on TV.
You crushed it.

-I fucking love kings.
-Richard: Oh, yeah.

241
00:09:58,978 --> 00:10:01,186
So listen, um,
did they swear you in?

242
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:03,895
Like, pull the whole
Johnny Law routine with you?

243
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:05,061
Were you under oath?

244
00:10:05,144 --> 00:10:06,144
Uh, no.

245
00:10:06,228 --> 00:10:07,853
Cool! Well,
that's a weight off.

246
00:10:08,436 --> 00:10:09,770
-Why?
-Well,

247
00:10:09,853 --> 00:10:12,812
you said all that stuff about
not collecting user data.

248
00:10:12,895 --> 00:10:15,937
-Yes?
-But we are.

249
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:17,895
-I am.
-What?

250
00:10:17,978 --> 00:10:19,436
But I'm doing
the right thing now

251
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,019
by telling you,
so I feel like--

252
00:10:21,103 --> 00:10:22,520
I-I'm sorry, Colin.

253
00:10:22,603 --> 00:10:24,478
How long have you been
collecting user data?

254
00:10:24,561 --> 00:10:26,561
Sorta... the whole time.

255
00:10:26,645 --> 00:10:28,561
But it's just
to improve

256
00:10:28,645 --> 00:10:31,144
the quality of my gameplay.
I'm not using it to sell ads.

257
00:10:31,228 --> 00:10:32,978
It doesn't fucking matter.

258
00:10:33,061 --> 00:10:36,269
It goes against the principles
of this company. I mean...

259
00:10:36,353 --> 00:10:38,144
Shit, I just lied to Congress.

260
00:10:38,228 --> 00:10:39,144
No.

261
00:10:39,228 --> 00:10:42,395
You said a lie to Congress,

262
00:10:42,478 --> 00:10:45,353
but you didn't know
at the time, I guess.

263
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:48,061
Don't beat yourself up
about it, huh?

264
00:10:48,895 --> 00:10:51,103
But going forward,
maybe stop saying that.

265
00:10:51,186 --> 00:10:52,812
Are you fucking kidding me?

266
00:10:52,895 --> 00:10:54,978
Or do say it.
I don't care.

267
00:10:55,061 --> 00:10:56,645
Maybe it'll be like Google
saying "Don't be evil,"

268
00:10:56,728 --> 00:10:58,812
or Facebook saying
"I'm sorry,
we'll do better,"

269
00:10:58,895 --> 00:11:02,186
or me saying
" Gates of Galloo  does not
leave your headset mic open

270
00:11:02,269 --> 00:11:04,061
and record everything you say.
Suck it."

271
00:11:04,144 --> 00:11:05,728
Sweet fucking shit.

272
00:11:05,812 --> 00:11:09,019
A-a-are you...
bugging people and storing

273
00:11:09,103 --> 00:11:10,687
their private conversations
on my network?

274
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,853
Colin!
This stops, now.

275
00:11:12,937 --> 00:11:14,144
It would really
be better for me

276
00:11:14,228 --> 00:11:16,144
if you just stopped
lying about it,

277
00:11:16,228 --> 00:11:17,978
'cause the game's
pretty boss.

278
00:11:18,061 --> 00:11:19,228
No, no. I'm the boss,

279
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:22,353
and I'm telling you
that this is over, Colin.

280
00:11:22,436 --> 00:11:24,687
-It's done.
-Agree to disagree.

281
00:11:25,353 --> 00:11:26,978
I'm glad we had this talk.

282
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,561
(laughs) Can't believe
I was so nervous.

283
00:11:29,645 --> 00:11:31,311
Congratulations.

284
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:36,228
Okay.

285
00:11:36,311 --> 00:11:37,603
Monica:
Oh, Richard! Hey.

286
00:11:37,687 --> 00:11:40,561
This is Sam Liccardo,
the mayor of San Jose.

287
00:11:40,645 --> 00:11:42,103
(quietly):
There's a major
fucking problem.

288
00:11:42,186 --> 00:11:44,228
Just meet me in my office
in two minutes. Act normal.

289
00:11:45,144 --> 00:11:47,436
Sorry, just excuse me
for a second.

290
00:11:50,436 --> 00:11:51,520
Hey, Jared!

291
00:11:51,603 --> 00:11:53,603
Hey, Tracy!

292
00:11:53,687 --> 00:11:56,645
-How's my favorite
human resource?
-I'm fine, thanks.

293
00:11:56,728 --> 00:11:58,561
Did anyone mention our
plan to move your office?

294
00:11:58,645 --> 00:12:00,645
We're thinking about
putting you closer
to biz dev and marketing.

295
00:12:00,728 --> 00:12:03,812
But that's... all the way
back in the Hamelin Wing.

296
00:12:03,895 --> 00:12:05,853
Yeah! Follow me,
I'll show you.

297
00:12:05,937 --> 00:12:07,978
Um... Okay, it's just,

298
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,978
that's a little far from--
from Richard's office.

299
00:12:11,061 --> 00:12:13,103
Yes, but you really
don't have any

300
00:12:13,186 --> 00:12:14,895
day-to-day business
with Richard anymore.

301
00:12:14,978 --> 00:12:17,353
I mean, we were just
walking and talking before.

302
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:20,561
Oh. Looks like
they're having a meeting.
I should probably--

303
00:12:20,645 --> 00:12:22,019
It's just better
for office cohesion

304
00:12:22,103 --> 00:12:23,812
if you sit near
your direct reports,

305
00:12:23,895 --> 00:12:26,269
and that is biz dev
and marketing.

306
00:12:26,353 --> 00:12:27,895
Yeah, no, you
mentioned that. It's--

307
00:12:27,978 --> 00:12:30,853
it's an interesting idea,
but I just think that, um,

308
00:12:30,937 --> 00:12:32,269
I think we should
check with Richard first

309
00:12:32,353 --> 00:12:34,228
'cause I think he's gonna
want me a little bit closer.

310
00:12:34,311 --> 00:12:36,061
Of course.
It's subject
to his approval.

311
00:12:36,144 --> 00:12:38,561
-Okay.
-I've already emailed him.
I think once you see

312
00:12:38,645 --> 00:12:41,269
the conference
room suites though,
you'll really fall in love.

313
00:12:41,353 --> 00:12:43,770
-Okay. Yeah.
-Just right through here.

314
00:12:43,853 --> 00:12:46,144
Well, I don't fall
in love with rooms.

315
00:12:47,103 --> 00:12:50,269
So, how do we get rid
of this fucker?

316
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:52,812
Look, Richard, I don't like
this any more than you do,

317
00:12:52,895 --> 00:12:54,937
but we can't
get rid of Colin.

318
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:57,561
He's our most profitable
developer by far.

319
00:12:57,645 --> 00:12:59,603
-So what? We have
other developers.
-We do,

320
00:12:59,687 --> 00:13:01,478
but they're all
entangled with Galloo  !

321
00:13:01,561 --> 00:13:04,269
We worked really hard
to build a whole
ecosystem around it.

322
00:13:04,353 --> 00:13:06,186
It's like if you
cancel a Warriors game,
you're not just

323
00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:08,645
hurting the team,
but you're also hurting
the parking attendants,

324
00:13:08,728 --> 00:13:10,770
and the T-shirt guys,
and the concessions.

325
00:13:10,853 --> 00:13:12,561
Okay. Thank you, Monica,

326
00:13:12,645 --> 00:13:15,478
for putting it into an analogy
that will resonate with me.

327
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,186
-Football.
-It's basketball.

328
00:13:17,812 --> 00:13:20,603
-No, I know.
-Losing him is no
longer a simple thing.

329
00:13:20,687 --> 00:13:23,269
So, what are you saying?
We just do nothing?

330
00:13:23,353 --> 00:13:24,978
Richard,
he's not selling ads.

331
00:13:25,061 --> 00:13:27,395
He's just using it to optimize
the performance of his game.

332
00:13:27,478 --> 00:13:30,353
It's actually a fairly
elegant implementation.

333
00:13:30,436 --> 00:13:31,728
What?

334
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:33,144
What?!

335
00:13:33,228 --> 00:13:35,353
Hiroshima was an elegant
implementation.

336
00:13:35,436 --> 00:13:37,895
-I don't think anyone
agrees with you on that.
-No, I'm saying,

337
00:13:37,978 --> 00:13:40,520
just because it's successful,
doesn't mean it's good.

338
00:13:40,603 --> 00:13:42,728
I mean, it goes against
everything we stand for.

339
00:13:42,812 --> 00:13:44,603
I mean, if we start
collecting personal data

340
00:13:44,687 --> 00:13:46,561
"just for the good stuff,"
I mean, next thing we know,

341
00:13:46,645 --> 00:13:48,061
-we're fucking Facebook.
-Dinesh: Well,

342
00:13:48,144 --> 00:13:51,144
for the record,
I would not mind
being fucking Facebook.

343
00:13:51,228 --> 00:13:54,645
No. We gotta kick him off, okay?
There are 500 people out there

344
00:13:54,728 --> 00:13:57,103
who believe in this company's
ethics and standards.

345
00:13:57,186 --> 00:13:59,561
There are 532 people out there,

346
00:13:59,645 --> 00:14:01,687

348
00:14:03,395 --> 00:14:04,812

In Hawaii,

351
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,978
aloha means hello and goodbye.

352

353

negotiations,

363
00:14:36,937 --> 00:14:38,311
I'm happy to say
that we've come

364
00:14:38,395 --> 00:14:40,103

366
00:14:42,186 --> 00:14:44,561
Amazon has agreed to no layoffs,
and they'll even provide

367
00:14:44,645 --> 00:14:47,019
retention bonuses for
a period of two years.

368
00:14:47,103 --> 00:14:48,895
Uh, what about my role?

369
00:14:48,978 --> 00:14:50,728
No change.
Essentially,
you'll still have

What were his
exact words?

384

office down here?

522
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:38,978
Yeah, she-- she mentioned it.
I approved it.

536
00:22:09,228 --> 00:22:10,895

537
00:22:10,978 --> 00:22:12,812
in the defense of ethics.

538
00:22:12,895 --> 00:22:16,061
Uh, unjust in
the quest for justice.

539
00:22:16,144 --> 00:22:17,853
It's like stealing
from your pimp

540
00:22:17,937 --> 00:22:19,561

friend's appendectomy.

541

543

I charge shit to

Aah, fuck.

553
00:22:48,436 --> 00:22:50,395
You see, Colin,
we were able to break down

554
00:22:50,478 --> 00:22:53,019
all of your misdeeds
by category,

555
00:22:53,103 --> 00:22:56,353
including a catch-all
for personal embarrassment.

556
00:22:56,436 --> 00:22:57,687
Masturbation, farts,

557
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:59,478
the one time
you said that

558
00:22:59,561 --> 00:23:01,186
you could, if you wanted to,

559
00:23:01,269 --> 00:23:03,269

Harold Gibbons, the man...

574

Here's what's
gonna happen.

579

You're gonna march
into that meeting,
and you're gonna make

580
00:23:47,144 --> 00:23:48,561
an amendment
to your company bylaws

581
00:23:48,645 --> 00:23:50,269

never record

582

data ever again.

694
00:28:22,978 --> 00:28:24,103
Well, I know you're
my therapist.

695
00:28:24,186 --> 00:28:25,645
I was there when
the court appointed you.

696
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:28,061
But I-I let my desire
to be around Richard,

697
00:28:28,144 --> 00:28:29,436
and to be needed by him,

698
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,103
turn me into some kind
of a craven yes-man,

699
00:28:32,186 --> 00:28:33,937
and it clouded my judgment,

700
00:28:34,019 --> 00:28:35,770
and I led him down
a horrible path.

00:28:37,269 --> 00:28:38,311
What?

702
00:28:38,895 --> 00:28:42,311
I'm not-- I'm not
gonna dignify that.
Of course I belong there.

703
00:28:42,395 --> 00:28:44,478
Where else would
I possibly belong?

00:28:45,103 --> 00:28:46,728

Big Head,

723
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,520
we need to kick Gwart
out of the incubator.

00:29:33,603 --> 00:29:36,186

Gwart?

Gwart has a very good idea,

very good software,

729

for business plan,

730

she doesn't have
a business plan.

731
00:29:47,353 --> 00:29:48,978
She's a brilliant coder,

732
00:29:49,061 --> 00:29:51,978
but this is not a charity.

733
00:29:52,061 --> 00:29:54,436
She's also
not very friendly.

734
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,770
It's a bad for the vibe.
