Now, Dinesh, look,
if I'd taken that 10 million,

34
00:01:42,214 --> 00:01:45,089
you wouldn't own
two and a half percent

Two and a half percent
of a billion dollars is
$25 million!

36

Yes, but, actually,
the billion dollars

37
00:01:51,381 --> 00:01:53,297
was to own ten percent

you would, uh, technically,

00:02:59,631 --> 00:03:01,005

zero.

81
00:03:40,839 --> 00:03:44,464

Maximo has bought all of
Laurie's Pied Piper shares,

as well as all the shares
of Big Head's dad.

He now owns 30 percent
of the company.

84
00:03:49,047 --> 00:03:51,047
So, the only way we can
raise money to stay alive

85
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,172
is by selling shares,
but the second we do that...

86
00:03:53,255 --> 00:03:54,381

87
00:03:54,464 --> 00:03:56,381

a majority stake,

00:07:29,631 --> 00:07:32,089
-you remember
my cousin, Wajeed?
-Yes.

174
00:07:32,172 --> 00:07:34,547
Coz, I have been
meaning to call you.

175
00:07:34,631 --> 00:07:36,172
Remember last year
when you wanted to sell

176
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:38,589
all those shares of
Bro that I gave you?

177
00:07:38,673 --> 00:07:40,589
And I was like,
don't sell those shares!

178
00:07:40,673 --> 00:07:42,547
And you were like,
"I need the money

179
00:07:42,631 --> 00:07:44,798
"to buy floor mats for my Tesla,
so I can make a guy

180
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,631
named Danny
in the office feel bad."

181
00:07:46,714 --> 00:07:48,089
Dinesh:
Good memory. Um,

182
00:07:48,172 --> 00:07:50,964
but, you know, Bro was
basically out of business.

183
00:07:51,047 --> 00:07:52,464
It was.

184
00:07:52,547 --> 00:07:54,839
But so wild!

185
00:07:54,923 --> 00:07:57,756
After you sold those shares,
I sold Bro to MoveShack

186
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:01,923
for basically nothing,
and yesterday,

187
00:08:02,005 --> 00:08:03,839
MoveShack got "acquired"

188
00:08:03,923 --> 00:08:08,547
by Snapchat, and, uh...
(chuckles) we crushed it!

189
00:08:09,464 --> 00:08:12,464
-How much did you make?
-Oh, you won't believe this--

190
00:08:12,547 --> 00:08:15,214
(speaking Urdu)

191
00:08:18,047 --> 00:08:20,089
-(speaks Urdu)
-Sixty million dollars?

192
00:08:20,172 --> 00:08:21,798
Wajeed:
Yes, 60 million dollars!

193
00:08:21,881 --> 00:08:24,547
I'm a golden millionaire!

194
00:08:24,631 --> 00:08:26,130
Times two!

195
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:29,005
Gilfoyle:
So, Dinesh sold his shares,

196
00:08:29,089 --> 00:08:33,255
and then your fortunes
turned around. Is that right?

197
00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:36,589
Wajeed:
Huh. Weird.
It's just like that time.

198
00:08:36,673 --> 00:08:39,756
Remember, you, me, and Ali,
we went down to play
by the river...

199
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,714
-Oh... Boring story.
-...and then, and then Dinesh,

200
00:08:42,798 --> 00:08:45,422
you snuck home so that
you could get Ali's jump rope

201
00:08:45,506 --> 00:08:46,673
and play with it by yourself,

202
00:08:46,756 --> 00:08:48,839
without telling him,

203
00:08:48,923 --> 00:08:52,130
and then Ali and I
found a giant...

204
00:08:52,214 --> 00:08:54,839
giant box of British candy.

205
00:08:54,923 --> 00:08:55,881
You love candy.

206
00:08:55,964 --> 00:08:57,506
Wajeed:
Oh, it was the best.

207
00:08:57,589 --> 00:08:59,839
Anyway, I'm
a golden millionaire.

208
00:08:59,923 --> 00:09:02,089
How about I buy drinks, yeah?

209
00:09:03,464 --> 00:09:05,381
-Karma's a--
-You're a bitch.

210
00:09:05,464 --> 00:09:07,214
Anyway, the fucking
US government

211
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,172
blocked the entire thing.
Can you believe that?

212
00:09:09,255 --> 00:09:10,839
I pay taxes.

213
00:09:11,798 --> 00:09:13,631
-I mean, I don't, but...
-Yeah.

214
00:09:14,214 --> 00:09:15,756
But look,
I mean, I think

215
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,381
we're even more
fucked than you are.

216
00:09:17,464 --> 00:09:19,339
We're quite a pair,
aren't we?

217
00:09:19,422 --> 00:09:22,506
To us. To the men
in the arena,

218
00:09:22,589 --> 00:09:26,047
living or dying under
the watchful gaze of Caesar.

219
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,214
Are you not entertained?

220
00:09:28,297 --> 00:09:30,130
(phone chimes)

221
00:09:34,964 --> 00:09:38,381
It's, uh, from Jared Dunn.
Do you remember him?

222
00:09:38,464 --> 00:09:40,255
Of course. How's he doing?

223
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:42,255
Actually, uh, funny enough,

224
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:45,756
he just bailed on me
to go work for some...

225
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,923
sexy new startup back
at my old hacker hostel.

226
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:52,005
Ironic. Exactly the same way
he left me, for you.

227
00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:54,172
Jared always
had an eye for talent.

228
00:09:56,089 --> 00:09:57,839
Thanks, I guess.

229
00:09:57,923 --> 00:10:00,089
So, what was the munition

230
00:10:00,172 --> 00:10:02,130
that CIFIUS got
on your case for?

231
00:10:02,214 --> 00:10:03,798
Some kind of...

232
00:10:03,881 --> 00:10:06,172
-illegal hacking tool?
-You wanna hear the worst part?

233
00:10:06,255 --> 00:10:09,297
It's a fucking dating
app called Foxhole.

234
00:10:09,381 --> 00:10:10,923
-An app?
-Yep!

235
00:10:11,005 --> 00:10:13,381
I can't shut it down
because my investors
will lose their shit,

236
00:10:13,464 --> 00:10:15,297
and I can't sell it because
who the fuck wants something

237
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:18,047
-with all those
restrictions on it?
-(chuckles): Right.

238
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:19,631
(sighing):
Anyway...

239
00:10:21,673 --> 00:10:23,172
Here's to us,

240
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:24,506
the Shackletons,

241
00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:27,589
-betrayed by nature's
cruelest whims...
-Wait.

242
00:10:27,673 --> 00:10:29,923
-...her wants--
-Sorry, just--

243
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:32,005
If I owned Foxhole,

244
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,631
wouldn't that prevent
this Chilean guy

245
00:10:33,714 --> 00:10:35,839
from buying more
of my shares?

246
00:10:35,923 --> 00:10:37,381
Actually, it would go
even further.

247
00:10:37,464 --> 00:10:39,631
He'd have to sell
all the shares he already owns.

248
00:10:39,714 --> 00:10:41,047
Okay, so, um,

249
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:43,714
if you sell me Foxhole,
I mean, that would

250
00:10:43,798 --> 00:10:45,673
certainly save
my ass, obviously,

251
00:10:45,756 --> 00:10:48,381
but it would
also save yours

252
00:10:48,464 --> 00:10:51,214
because then you could move your
operations wherever you wanted.

253
00:10:51,673 --> 00:10:53,631
I mean, it's kind
of perfect, right?

254
00:10:53,714 --> 00:10:56,589
It would benefit
us both, equally.

255
00:10:56,673 --> 00:10:58,172
-(laughs) Holy shit.
-Yeah.

256
00:10:58,255 --> 00:11:01,964
Um, look, Gavin, I know
we always haven't seen
eye-to-eye,

257
00:11:02,047 --> 00:11:04,464
we're not the best
of friends, but...

258
00:11:04,547 --> 00:11:07,172
this may be
a chance to actually

259
00:11:07,255 --> 00:11:09,798
help each other out, right?

260
00:11:09,881 --> 00:11:11,631
What do you say?

261
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:14,547
I mean...
isn't it obvious?

262
00:11:15,172 --> 00:11:17,964
I say... no!

263
00:11:19,172 --> 00:11:20,756
-What?
-No!

264
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:22,506
Fuck no, Richard!

265
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:24,756
I can't make a move
that would benefit you.

266
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:26,589
You're my competition.
Help no rival.

267
00:11:26,673 --> 00:11:28,756
It's one of the basic
principles of business.

268
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:31,047
We just spent the last
hour bonding about how

269
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:33,589
this business is comprised
of backstabbers and cutthroats.

270
00:11:33,673 --> 00:11:36,589
Yes, exactly!
That's what this is.

271
00:11:37,422 --> 00:11:39,047
It's a little weird
you don't get it.

272
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,506
I could help you, Gavin.

273
00:11:40,589 --> 00:11:42,297
You already have, Richard!

274
00:11:42,381 --> 00:11:44,172
I mean, I was sitting
up here feeling

275
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,881
totally just impotent,
and then you came along

276
00:11:46,964 --> 00:11:49,714
and exposed your underbelly,
and practically begged me

277
00:11:49,798 --> 00:11:52,339
to plunge the knife in!
I mean, I still have a deep hole

278
00:11:52,422 --> 00:11:55,589
to crawl out of, but this
is a fucking great start.

279
00:11:56,631 --> 00:11:57,881
Look at that.

280
00:11:57,964 --> 00:12:00,214
It barely hurts anymore.

281
00:12:00,297 --> 00:12:01,714
Well, if you'll excuse me,

282
00:12:01,798 --> 00:12:03,255
I have a triathlon
to train for,

283
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:05,964
and I'm suddenly feeling
a wellspring of energy.

284
00:12:07,047 --> 00:12:08,798
Ron:
Look, Richie,

285
00:12:09,422 --> 00:12:11,172
you're basically outta options.

286
00:12:11,255 --> 00:12:13,214
So, what are
you saying? That...

287
00:12:13,297 --> 00:12:15,172
I just lay down and die?

288
00:12:16,381 --> 00:12:19,422
I take issue with your
definition of die, my dude.

289
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:22,297
I can get that Chilean cat
on the phone right now
and get you paid.

290
00:12:22,381 --> 00:12:24,005
There's
no shame in it.

291
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:27,756
Musk built PayPal and sold.
Hoffman built LinkedIn and sold.

292
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,339
You seen those guys lately?

293
00:12:29,422 --> 00:12:33,047
I don't care about the money,
that's not why I got into this.

294
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:36,130
Richie, can I be honest
with you for once?

295
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:39,005
For once? You're my attorney.

296
00:12:41,798 --> 00:12:46,047
You remember the end
of Thelma and Louise?

297
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,214
How they drove
that car off the cliff?

298
00:12:48,297 --> 00:12:52,673
Why? That was
a mint '66 T-Bird.

299
00:12:52,756 --> 00:12:55,798
They didn't need that car
to get over the cliff.
Why'd that car have to die?

300
00:12:55,881 --> 00:12:58,547
I-I think it had
something to do with, um,

301
00:12:58,631 --> 00:13:00,714
-women's rights or something?
-Important stuff.

302
00:13:00,798 --> 00:13:02,964
But... sorry,
what's your point?

303
00:13:03,047 --> 00:13:04,631
My point, Richie,

304
00:13:04,714 --> 00:13:07,547
is you wanna go over the cliff,
Thelma, that's fine.

305
00:13:07,631 --> 00:13:09,089
All right? You do you.

306
00:13:09,172 --> 00:13:12,255
But you gotta remember
there are 500 other people

307
00:13:12,339 --> 00:13:16,130
in the trunk that are gonna
burst into flames with you.

308
00:13:16,214 --> 00:13:18,005
And for what?

309
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,923
-Computers?
-(phone vibrating)

310
00:13:20,005 --> 00:13:22,214
That's Jared. He's been
calling me all day.

311
00:13:22,297 --> 00:13:24,798
Uh, hey, can I call you back?
I'm in the middle of something.

312
00:13:24,881 --> 00:13:27,172
Did you talk to Gavin Belson
about Gwart's company,

313
00:13:27,255 --> 00:13:28,673
and call her sexy?

314
00:13:28,756 --> 00:13:30,297
Richard (phone):
Uh, what? No.

315
00:13:30,381 --> 00:13:32,631
I mean, yes,
but I barely mentioned it.

316
00:13:32,714 --> 00:13:35,839
Did you call her sexy?
Yes or no?

317
00:13:35,923 --> 00:13:38,547
I think I was more
talking about her tech.

318
00:13:38,631 --> 00:13:40,089
Jared:
So, you told Gavin Belson,

319
00:13:40,172 --> 00:13:42,756
a lion in repose,

320
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:44,923
that Gwart was
a potential threat,

321
00:13:45,005 --> 00:13:47,631
and now Jian-Yang is selling
us to him for pocket change.

322
00:13:47,714 --> 00:13:49,297
-Jian-Yang can do that?
-Yeah.

323
00:13:49,381 --> 00:13:52,381
He owns 60 percent
of the company.
He can do whatever he wants.

324
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:54,589
Gavin is shutting
us down, Richard.

325
00:13:54,673 --> 00:13:56,547
Gwart is so mad,
she won't even look at me.

326
00:13:56,631 --> 00:13:59,130
-Richard: Aah, fuck.
-You know, if you want revenge

327
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:00,964
on me, that's fine.

328
00:14:01,047 --> 00:14:02,464
But to go after Gwart?

329
00:14:02,547 --> 00:14:04,005
She doesn't have

330
00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:06,673
your savvy or your
ruthlessness, Richard.

331
00:14:06,756 --> 00:14:08,631
Hell, she has to wear
earplugs on hikes

332
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:10,214
because the forest is too loud.

333
00:14:10,297 --> 00:14:12,798
Look, I was only talking
to Gavin to save Pied Piper.

334
00:14:12,881 --> 00:14:13,923
I-I had no idea he was--

335
00:14:14,005 --> 00:14:15,381
A monster? Of course you did!

336
00:14:15,464 --> 00:14:17,839
That's all you talked
about for years!

337
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:19,005
"Gavin is a monster.

338
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:21,506
Poor Pied Piper.
I'm Richard Hendricks."

339
00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:22,798
I don't think
my voice is that deep.

340
00:14:22,881 --> 00:14:24,923
I mean, who is
the buddy-fucker now?

341
00:14:25,005 --> 00:14:27,547
-You are the buddy-fucker.

he tipped his hand.

Big question,

393
00:16:36,297 --> 00:16:37,964
-how do we buy Hooli?
-Monica: Well,

394
00:16:38,047 --> 00:16:40,798
in order to get the cash,
we have to sell a chunk

395
00:16:40,881 --> 00:16:43,255
of our shares to someone
other than Maximo,

396
00:16:43,339 --> 00:16:44,964
and, I mean,

397
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:47,214
whoever we rope into that
is gonna lose a fortune.

398
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,297
-Because...?
-Richard: Well,
we'd be selling to them

399
00:16:49,381 --> 00:16:50,798
at our current
high price.

400
00:16:50,881 --> 00:16:52,964
And when we acquire
Hooli and Foxhole,

401
00:16:53,047 --> 00:16:55,506
CIFIUS will force Maximo
to dump all his shares,

402
00:16:55,589 --> 00:16:57,130
and our valuation
will plummet.

403
00:16:57,214 --> 00:16:58,923
And I couldn't do
that to anyone.

404
00:16:59,005 --> 00:17:01,297
Oh? Couldn't you?

405
00:17:02,464 --> 00:17:04,339
Yeah, I-I'm not sure
I could do it either.

406
00:17:04,422 --> 00:17:05,714
Okay! Deal breaker then, right?

407
00:17:05,798 --> 00:17:07,547

literally last week, Farooq was
calling me, and he was like,

418
00:17:30,923 --> 00:17:32,631
"Hey, you know
who's a good guy?"

419
00:17:32,714 --> 00:17:34,381
And I was like,
"My cousin Dinesh!"

420
00:17:34,464 --> 00:17:37,589
And he was like,
"Yes. Yes, your cousin,

421
00:17:37,673 --> 00:17:39,214
-Dinesh."
-That's me.

422
00:17:39,297 --> 00:17:42,673
It's hard for me to say,
but I-I think we should
hang out more, okay?

423
00:17:42,756 --> 00:17:45,297
And that's my fault,

I will call you

514
00:21:48,714 --> 00:21:50,631
-Look, should
we maybe talk about--
-My guest is

515
00:21:50,714 --> 00:21:56,130
(louder): a medical bioethicist
who learned about opioid
dependence the hard way.

516
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:59,047
You know, I really ought
to consult with my wife

517
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:01,881
before I make such
a big financial decision.

518
00:22:03,214 --> 00:22:06,547
You're really gonna let
a woman tell you what to do?

519
00:22:10,422 --> 00:22:11,881
Over here!

520
00:22:11,964 --> 00:22:13,547
(panting)

521
00:22:14,881 --> 00:22:17,839
-(clears throat)
-Oh, thank you.

522
00:22:17,923 --> 00:22:20,047
Almost done here.

523
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,881
Gavin's just
starting the run.

524
00:22:21,964 --> 00:22:24,005
His blood O2 is dog shit.

525
00:22:24,089 --> 00:22:27,214
(panting)

526
00:22:29,005 --> 00:22:31,005
-Plan J, sir?
-Plan J!

527
00:22:31,089 --> 00:22:33,255
(panting)

528
00:22:34,506 --> 00:22:36,255
Jay!

529
00:22:36,339 --> 00:22:38,422
You are my spitting image.

530
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:41,005
I'll meet you a quarter
mile from the finish line.

531
00:22:41,089 --> 00:22:42,547
Go, go, go, go, go!

532
00:22:42,631 --> 00:22:44,756
♪ ♪

533
00:22:46,422 --> 00:22:48,047
(inhales)

534
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:50,130
I still got it, Hoover.

535
00:22:50,214 --> 00:22:51,339
I know you do, sir.

536
00:22:51,422 --> 00:22:53,422
As long as Jay
doesn't fuck up,

537
00:22:53,506 --> 00:22:55,130
I'm gonna beat
my personal record.

538
00:22:55,214 --> 00:22:57,339
Let's see,
we started at 10:00,

539
00:22:57,422 --> 00:22:59,089
and now it's...

540
00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:03,089
I gave Jay my watch.

541
00:23:03,464 --> 00:23:04,964
(clears throat)

542
00:23:06,631 --> 00:23:08,339
The fuck?!

543
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:11,214
Turn around!
Turn around, Hoover!

544
00:23:11,297 --> 00:23:12,422
-Yes, sir.
-(honks horn)

545
00:23:12,506 --> 00:23:14,130
Mother fuck!

546
00:23:14,214 --> 00:23:17,506
-Lex: So, you've got them
all signed, have you?
-Richard: Yeah.

547
00:23:17,589 --> 00:23:20,047
And you can just, uh,
countersign all that, and-and,

548
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:21,881
your form to sign
is at the end there.

549
00:23:21,964 --> 00:23:23,464
Do that, and we'll
be out of your way.

550
00:23:23,547 --> 00:23:25,005
(sighs)

551
00:23:32,297 --> 00:23:33,964
Fresca.

552
00:23:35,506 --> 00:23:36,839
(sighs)

553
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:45,172
Ah.

554
00:23:48,756 --> 00:23:50,839
Let's have a look-see, huh?

555
00:23:53,464 --> 00:23:56,130
"To whom it may...

556
00:23:57,506 --> 00:23:58,756
concern."

557
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:01,255
Okay, and actually,
the signature page--

558
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:03,964
-I've done these things before!
-Yep.

559
00:24:04,047 --> 00:24:05,756
No, I know.
I know.

560
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:07,923
What do you mean
not to be disturbed?

561
00:24:08,005 --> 00:24:09,589
I just got a million
texts that he's about

562
00:24:09,673 --> 00:24:11,714
to sign away
my whole fucking company!

563
00:24:12,172 --> 00:24:15,464
It's Gavin fucking Belson,
you clattering magpie!

564
00:24:17,214 --> 00:24:18,130
Hello?

565
00:24:18,214 --> 00:24:19,589
Fuck!

566
00:24:19,673 --> 00:24:21,547
We need to get
to Lex's. Now!

567
00:24:21,631 --> 00:24:23,506
All right. Seven down,

568
00:24:23,589 --> 00:24:25,255
-one to go!
-(clears throat)

569
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:26,881
Yep. Yeah,
just finish signing

570
00:24:26,964 --> 00:24:28,214
that form there,
and we will--

571
00:24:28,297 --> 00:24:30,297
-(door bangs open)
-Stop! Lex, stop!

572
00:24:30,381 --> 00:24:31,547
Gavin?

573
00:24:33,214 --> 00:24:35,255
-Huh?
-I thought he was in the race.

574
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:36,881
-Gavin.
-Yeah, he is.

575
00:24:36,964 --> 00:24:39,297
Looks like he's waiting about
a mile from the finish line.

576
00:24:39,381 --> 00:24:41,547
-(panting)
-Oh.

577
00:24:41,631 --> 00:24:44,798
You are a sneaky little
gladiator, aren't you, Richard?

578
00:24:44,881 --> 00:24:47,047
But the Hooli charter,
which I wrote,

579
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:49,381
gives me the right
to block this transaction.

580
00:24:49,464 --> 00:24:51,255
Uh, no. It doesn't.

581
00:24:51,339 --> 00:24:53,005
Richard:
Yeah, that's right. You, uh,

582
00:24:53,089 --> 00:24:55,756
you had two hours,
which lapsed--

583
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:57,214
Seven minutes ago.

584
00:24:59,547 --> 00:25:01,214
I'm afraid they're right.

585
00:25:01,631 --> 00:25:02,798
Shit.

586
00:25:02,881 --> 00:25:04,964
Okay, fine!
I can't block it!

587
00:25:05,047 --> 00:25:08,172
But come on, Lex!
We have a history together!

588
00:25:08,255 --> 00:25:10,506
You wrote the very
first check to Hooli.

589
00:25:10,589 --> 00:25:12,839
You're not gonna turn
your back on 30 years

590
00:25:12,923 --> 00:25:15,047
of making money
together, are you?

591
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:17,130
I know we're not in the
strongest position right now,

592
00:25:17,214 --> 00:25:19,923
but I will fight my way back,
that's what I do.

593
00:25:20,005 --> 00:25:22,964
I-I kick and I scrap
and I-I play dirty.

594
00:25:23,047 --> 00:25:25,214
Anything to win!
I-I-I could've

595
00:25:25,297 --> 00:25:28,172
bailed Richard out,
but I didn't! I fucked him!

596
00:25:28,255 --> 00:25:30,047
And then,
I fucked over...

597
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,506
"world poker tour" there!

598
00:25:31,589 --> 00:25:33,589
Just for the spite of it,
just because I could!

599
00:25:33,673 --> 00:25:35,839
Look, forget all
the bullshit about

600
00:25:35,923 --> 00:25:37,339
making the world
a better place.

601
00:25:37,422 --> 00:25:40,214
The most valuable
companies in this valley

602
00:25:40,297 --> 00:25:43,547
were built and run
by-by savages,

603
00:25:43,631 --> 00:25:46,714
who cheat to win.
Zuckerberg, and Jobs,

604
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:49,756
and me, Gavin Belson.

605
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:53,673
So please, Lex,
put the pen down.

606
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:55,714
Leave your money where it is.

607
00:25:55,798 --> 00:25:57,297
Richard:
If this is a competition

608
00:25:57,381 --> 00:26:00,381
to find out who
the shittier person is,

609
00:26:00,464 --> 00:26:03,130
I'm not sure it's something
that I can add to.

610
00:26:03,881 --> 00:26:05,506
Dinesh:
I can.

611
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:08,964
-Dinesh?
-This must be said.

612
00:26:09,964 --> 00:26:12,214
Gavin, you think you're
the most spiteful guy in town,

613
00:26:12,297 --> 00:26:15,130
but you're not even the most
spiteful guy in this room.

614
00:26:15,214 --> 00:26:17,297
The truth is...

615
00:26:17,381 --> 00:26:19,047
I'm a bad person.

616
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:21,631
How do you think we got
the money for this deal?

617
00:26:21,714 --> 00:26:24,381
I lied to my cousin's face.

618
00:26:24,464 --> 00:26:28,214
He is going to lose
$40 million, give or take,

619
00:26:28,297 --> 00:26:31,172
plus his estate
in Hawaii... I hope.

620
00:26:31,255 --> 00:26:33,923
See?! I suck!

621
00:26:34,005 --> 00:26:36,130
Did you know that instead
of breaking up with a girl

622
00:26:36,214 --> 00:26:39,089
that scared me, I called
the FBI and sent her to prison?

623
00:26:39,172 --> 00:26:41,464
-The Teslas.
-Dinesh: Right.

624
00:26:42,005 --> 00:26:43,422
I pressured
my direct reports

625
00:26:43,506 --> 00:26:44,964
to buy Teslas that
they could not afford

626
00:26:45,047 --> 00:26:47,673
because I wanted better
wheels than a guy named Danny.

627
00:26:48,381 --> 00:26:50,172
And I was eight years old,

628
00:26:50,255 --> 00:26:52,005
I stole my friend
Ali's jump rope

629
00:26:52,089 --> 00:26:55,381
and tied it to the back
of a truck that drove away,

630
00:26:55,464 --> 00:26:58,047
and then I told him I had
no idea what happened to it.

631
00:26:58,130 --> 00:26:59,756
And when he cried
himself to sleep,

632
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:01,881
I ate his British
candy and told him

633
00:27:01,964 --> 00:27:03,631
God took it because
he hated him.

634
00:27:03,714 --> 00:27:05,547
-Jesus!
-Dinesh: So,

635
00:27:05,631 --> 00:27:07,047
if this decision is
going to come down

636
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:09,714
to who is the most spiteful,
then, respectfully, sir...

637
00:27:09,798 --> 00:27:11,714
-Lex: Stop! Stop!
-...I would argue--

638
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:13,923
Just stop talking!

639
00:27:14,005 --> 00:27:16,464
I don't wanna be in business
with any of you people.

640
00:27:16,547 --> 00:27:19,422
I don't even wanna be
in the same room with you!

641
00:27:19,506 --> 00:27:22,464
I'm gonna sign this
and take my money out.

642
00:27:22,547 --> 00:27:24,964
Oop! Gonna miss my bus.

643
00:27:25,047 --> 00:27:26,422
Ugh...

644
00:27:26,756 --> 00:27:29,964
Excuse me. Excuse me.

645
00:27:30,047 --> 00:27:31,589
Excuse me.

646
00:27:32,547 --> 00:27:34,297
Think you won?

647
00:27:34,381 --> 00:27:36,172
(laughing): Fuck you,
Richard Hendricks.

648
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:38,673
The Valley is small
and the road is long.

649
00:27:38,756 --> 00:27:41,214
Just keep looking
over your shoulder.

650
00:27:42,172 --> 00:27:43,881
Gentlemen.

651
00:27:44,547 --> 00:27:46,631
And lady-- Ow!

652
00:27:46,714 --> 00:27:49,297
Hoover! Help!

653
00:27:49,381 --> 00:27:50,756
(door opens)

654
00:27:52,214 --> 00:27:53,798
Richard:
Guys...

655
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:55,714
-(door shuts)
-Did we...

656
00:27:55,798 --> 00:27:57,923
Just buy Hooli?

657
00:27:58,464 --> 00:27:59,964
Yeah, we did.

658
00:28:00,047 --> 00:28:01,923
Holy shit.

659
00:28:02,673 --> 00:28:04,631
-(laughing)
-Feels pretty good!

660
00:28:06,089 --> 00:28:07,756
Wajeed is gonna be
so pissed at me.

661
00:28:08,547 --> 00:28:10,172
And mom's
gonna kill me.

662
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:13,964
So, I guess, uh, everyone
got what they want.

663
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:16,547
(clears throat)
Well, actually, uh, Jared.

664
00:28:17,589 --> 00:28:18,756
Hey, uh...

665
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:21,130
I just wanna say, like...

666
00:28:21,214 --> 00:28:24,255
I'm really sorry
about everything,

667
00:28:24,339 --> 00:28:27,089
and, uh, well,

668
00:28:27,506 --> 00:28:29,881
of course, I'd be happy

669
00:28:29,964 --> 00:28:32,631
to give you and Gwart
your company back.

670
00:28:32,714 --> 00:28:35,464
That's obvious.
And also, if you...

671
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,756
needed office space,

672
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:40,923
we'd be happy
to have you. Um...

673
00:28:41,339 --> 00:28:44,464
I guess, I don't know,
I just... I miss you, man.

674
00:28:45,589 --> 00:28:47,422
Whatever, I don't care.

675
00:28:50,631 --> 00:28:52,381
Monica: Jesus.

676
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:54,673
Yeah, it's sort
of his thing.

677
00:28:55,339 --> 00:28:56,714
(sighs)
All right,

678
00:28:56,798 --> 00:28:58,589
well, everybody's
gathered out there,

679
00:28:58,673 --> 00:29:01,506
-so you should
probably say something.
-Okay.

680
00:29:01,589 --> 00:29:03,964
Be gracious and don't
expect too much.

681
00:29:04,047 --> 00:29:05,798
What are you talking
about? I mean,

682
00:29:05,881 --> 00:29:08,589
won't they be happy?
I freed them from Gavin.

683
00:29:08,673 --> 00:29:11,255
I mean, that's one
way of looking at it.

684
00:29:11,339 --> 00:29:13,297
Or, your company just
swallowed theirs,

685
00:29:13,381 --> 00:29:15,547
and you fired their
founder and CEO.

686
00:29:15,964 --> 00:29:18,047
They're probably a little
freaked out. They wanna know
