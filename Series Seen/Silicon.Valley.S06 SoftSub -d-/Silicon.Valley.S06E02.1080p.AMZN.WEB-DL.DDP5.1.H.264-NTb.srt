1
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:09,255
Facebook, Google, and Amazon
exploit our data for profit.

2
00:00:09,339 --> 00:00:11,798
I will help you by building
an internet of the people

3
00:00:11,881 --> 00:00:13,339
by the people
and for the people,

4
00:00:13,422 --> 00:00:14,464
so help me God.

5
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:15,422
(CHEERING)

6
00:00:16,005 --> 00:00:19,089
You said all that stuff
about not collecting user data.

7
00:00:19,172 --> 00:00:20,923
-But I am.
-I just lied to Congress.

8
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:23,339
Hooli will remain
an independent entity,

9
00:00:23,422 --> 00:00:25,631
even if we have to shed
a few divisions

10
00:00:25,714 --> 00:00:27,297
and trim a little fat.

11
00:00:28,547 --> 00:00:30,422
Gwart has a really good idea,

12
00:00:30,506 --> 00:00:32,506
but she doesn't have
a business plan.

13
00:00:32,589 --> 00:00:33,631
Hi, I'm Jared.

14
00:00:34,923 --> 00:00:37,714
We were able to break down
all of your misdeeds.

15
00:00:37,798 --> 00:00:39,923
This guy is dirty as a dog,
and we got him.

16
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:41,214
Oh, hell yes.

17
00:00:41,297 --> 00:00:43,589
It's the greatest
data aggregating platform.

18
00:00:43,673 --> 00:00:46,547
And Richard developed it
specifically for us.

19
00:00:54,339 --> 00:00:56,047
Dinesh:
So this morning,
Colin cut a new build

20
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,297
of  Gates of Galloo
to his staging server.

21
00:00:59,756 --> 00:01:02,589
Okay, um, this
is Baldereach,

22
00:01:02,673 --> 00:01:04,214
capital city of Galloonia.

23
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:06,881
Those are some ghoul knights,
wearing gelatinous armor.

24
00:01:06,964 --> 00:01:08,881
This is just the game,
pretty standard stuff.

25
00:01:08,964 --> 00:01:10,839
Well, until I...

26
00:01:10,923 --> 00:01:12,422
turn on the microphone.

27
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:14,506
How are you doing, Richard?
Are you hungry?

28
00:01:14,589 --> 00:01:17,839
-Would you like some pizza?
-(game chimes)

29
00:01:19,297 --> 00:01:21,714
What the fuck?

30
00:01:21,798 --> 00:01:25,339
He's using our API to run ads
directly in the game engine?

31
00:01:25,422 --> 00:01:26,798
Gilfoyle:
Crazy, right?

32
00:01:26,881 --> 00:01:28,297
Domino's Pizza

33
00:01:28,381 --> 00:01:30,506
in a fantasy medieval universe.

34
00:01:30,589 --> 00:01:33,047
Why, it's enough to make
you wanna go on vacation.

35
00:01:33,714 --> 00:01:37,005
Gilfoyle: And he's even using
our ability to track sentiment.

36
00:01:37,089 --> 00:01:38,798
Yeah. Even if I say
nonsense words,

37
00:01:38,881 --> 00:01:40,673
it assigns them
an emotional value.

38
00:01:40,756 --> 00:01:43,214
La-la-la-la-la-la-la!

39
00:01:43,964 --> 00:01:46,047
Richard:
Fuck me. So,

40
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:48,047
unless we get rid of Colin,
which we can't,

41
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,631
he is going to put
this on our network.

42
00:01:51,339 --> 00:01:53,631
Money just perverts everything.

43
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:56,214
At this point, I could stand
to be a little perverted.

44
00:01:56,297 --> 00:01:57,964
Yeah, I wanna be
a lot perverted.

45
00:01:58,047 --> 00:02:01,214
I wanna blow money while it
talks to its wife on the phone.

46
00:02:01,297 --> 00:02:02,923
-I wanna suck money-- Oh.
-All right.

47
00:02:03,005 --> 00:02:04,964
-Microphone.
-Dinesh: Oh! Uh...

48
00:02:05,047 --> 00:02:07,005
Kittens, puppies,
United Nations!

49
00:02:07,506 --> 00:02:10,673
(theme music playing)

50
00:02:19,547 --> 00:02:22,255
Richard,
is this an okay time?

51
00:02:23,964 --> 00:02:25,339
It's a great time, Jared.

52
00:02:25,422 --> 00:02:29,005
I'm surrounded on all sides
by people who turn on me.

53
00:02:29,923 --> 00:02:33,005
-I can come back.
-No. No, no, it's fine.

54
00:02:33,089 --> 00:02:35,214
What do you got?

55
00:02:37,923 --> 00:02:39,631
(sighs) What is this?

56
00:02:39,714 --> 00:02:42,255
It's my resignation letter.

57
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:46,881
I'm leaving.

58
00:02:47,631 --> 00:02:48,881
What?

59
00:02:51,506 --> 00:02:54,214
One gaff with Colin,
and you're just gonna walk away?

60
00:02:54,297 --> 00:02:56,089
It's about so much more
than that, Richard.

61
00:02:56,172 --> 00:02:58,130
I've been agonizing
over this.

62
00:02:58,214 --> 00:03:00,839
Not sleeping,
not eating...

63
00:03:01,339 --> 00:03:04,547
I completely forgot
my godson's 40th birthday.

64
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:05,881
Richard,

65
00:03:05,964 --> 00:03:08,756
Pied Piper isn't the same
company that I signed up for.

66
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:11,506
She has different
needs now,

67
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:13,255
and so do you,

68
00:03:13,339 --> 00:03:15,964
and, it turns out,

69
00:03:16,756 --> 00:03:18,297
so do I.

70
00:03:19,589 --> 00:03:21,506
Okay, Jared...

71
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:23,339
we are in the middle
of a shit storm here.

72
00:03:23,422 --> 00:03:26,506
I'm trying to handle this
as honestly as possible.

73
00:03:26,589 --> 00:03:28,839
There's a founder
at the hacker hostel,

74
00:03:28,923 --> 00:03:31,172
and she needs my help, and...

75
00:03:31,255 --> 00:03:33,005
once I'm free of encumbrances--

76
00:03:33,089 --> 00:03:35,381
Encumbrances?! Oh! Well,

77
00:03:35,464 --> 00:03:38,422
fuck me, Jared.
I don't want to encumber you.

78
00:03:38,506 --> 00:03:40,464
(chuckling)
Okay.

79
00:03:40,547 --> 00:03:43,589
Go to your new boss.
I hope she's not a...

80
00:03:43,673 --> 00:03:46,297
big of a fuck-up
as I am, you...

81
00:03:46,381 --> 00:03:47,547
buddy-fucker.

82
00:03:48,339 --> 00:03:51,547
-I'm not a buddy-fucker.
-Oh, yes, you are, Jared.

83
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:53,381
You are a buddy-fucker.

84
00:03:53,464 --> 00:03:54,964
I am your buddy,

85
00:03:55,047 --> 00:03:57,214
and you are
fucking me. Ergo,

86
00:03:57,297 --> 00:03:59,297
you are a buddy-fucker.

87
00:04:01,464 --> 00:04:03,089
Goodbye.

88
00:04:06,506 --> 00:04:09,589
-Richard, I'm not--
-Goodbye, Jared. Thank you.

89
00:04:17,673 --> 00:04:19,172
I like it how it is.

90
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,923
But it's too warm.

91
00:04:21,005 --> 00:04:22,798
I want it warm.

92
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:26,172
(quietly):
Okay.

93
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,214
(inhales)

94
00:04:30,673 --> 00:04:32,422
Gentlemen, and lady,

95
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,047
a short time ago,
I reached out to you
and asked you

96
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,839
to invest, sight unseen,
in a newer,

97
00:04:37,923 --> 00:04:40,089
leaner, and more focused Hooli.

98
00:04:40,172 --> 00:04:42,756
And invest you did,
guided not by

99
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:45,464
traditional spreadsheets
or actuarial tables,

100
00:04:45,547 --> 00:04:47,714
but by your own highly
attuned financial--

101
00:04:47,798 --> 00:04:50,089
Gavin, cut the bullshit.

102
00:04:50,172 --> 00:04:51,381
What do we still own?

103
00:04:51,464 --> 00:04:53,255
Mr. Skelton.

104
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:55,255
As candid and as
forthright as ever.

105
00:04:55,339 --> 00:04:58,297
-Age has not dulled
one iota of--
-Gavin.

106
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:01,214
Of course. I had
prepared a presentation,

107
00:05:01,297 --> 00:05:03,130
but I suppose I can
just skip to the end.

108
00:05:03,214 --> 00:05:05,339
Hopefully, I won't
lose you. (chuckles)

109
00:05:05,422 --> 00:05:07,547
Okay...

110
00:05:08,172 --> 00:05:10,964
Confucius, John Lennon,

111
00:05:11,047 --> 00:05:13,381
Nietzsche, Ayn Rand,

112
00:05:13,464 --> 00:05:15,214
Steve Wonder,
and here we go!

113
00:05:15,297 --> 00:05:16,464
As you can see,

114
00:05:16,547 --> 00:05:19,339
among the many jewels
still in Hooli's crown

115
00:05:19,422 --> 00:05:22,673
are our exciting
suite of office--

116
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:24,756
Where is web services?

117
00:05:25,172 --> 00:05:28,547
Well, Mr. Bezos felt it would
fold nicely into his AWS,

118
00:05:28,631 --> 00:05:29,631
so he insisted--

119
00:05:29,714 --> 00:05:31,798
Smart speaker and in-home?

120
00:05:31,881 --> 00:05:35,339
-He took that, too?
-HooliHome was,
indeed, subsumed

121
00:05:35,422 --> 00:05:37,589
-by the Amazon Alexa--
-Targeted search?

122
00:05:37,673 --> 00:05:40,089
Ironically, also missing.

123
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,881
But we maintain rights
to the HooliPhone

124
00:05:42,964 --> 00:05:44,089
and its proprietary apps,

125
00:05:44,172 --> 00:05:47,214
the patent for
the Hooli Puck Mouse.

126
00:05:47,297 --> 00:05:49,964
We also maintain our
web-based marketplaces,

127
00:05:50,047 --> 00:05:53,923
including our up-and-coming
lifestyle networking platform,

128
00:05:54,005 --> 00:05:57,214
-Foxhole.
-What the fuck is that?!

129
00:05:57,297 --> 00:06:00,547
Well, Foxhole is
a very exciting

130
00:06:00,631 --> 00:06:03,839
web-based exchange,
catering to those
in the military,

131
00:06:03,923 --> 00:06:07,547
-who are interested in
having extramarital affairs.
-Skelton: Gavin,

132
00:06:07,631 --> 00:06:10,881
when do you expect
the eight of us will

133
00:06:10,964 --> 00:06:13,047
recoup our investment?

134
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:15,673
Ah, yes!
That's my very next slide.

135
00:06:15,756 --> 00:06:17,631
-After this one.
-(clicks)

136
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:20,923
Well, with a little luck,

137
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:25,047
we'll be profitable and up 5X
inside three years.

138
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:28,631
You got three months,
or you're out.

139
00:06:30,381 --> 00:06:32,547
So, Melanie will take on
all of Jared's

140
00:06:32,631 --> 00:06:34,589
marketing duties,
Gwen will cover biz dev,

141
00:06:34,673 --> 00:06:37,005
and that should
take care of it.

142
00:06:37,089 --> 00:06:38,255
Does this
scan to you?

143
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:40,214
-I can see it.
-Okay, great.

144
00:06:40,297 --> 00:06:43,005
-Richard: Okay, back to work.
-Tracy: Uh, Bertram,

145
00:06:43,089 --> 00:06:45,089
while I have you...

146
00:06:45,631 --> 00:06:47,464
You don't have me.

147
00:06:47,547 --> 00:06:50,422
Richard's just tasked me
with streamlining productivity

148
00:06:50,506 --> 00:06:51,881
and balancing headcount.

149
00:06:51,964 --> 00:06:53,714
Can you explain
to me why you have

150
00:06:53,798 --> 00:06:55,547
no one working under you?

151
00:06:55,631 --> 00:06:58,798
It just seems odd considering
that the agile board is showing

152
00:06:58,881 --> 00:07:00,756
that you have a massive backlog.

153
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:02,339
You're new here,

154
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,964
so I'll forgive
the patronizing tone.

155
00:07:05,255 --> 00:07:07,589
I'm more concerned
with being right

156
00:07:07,673 --> 00:07:09,422
than being fast,

157
00:07:09,506 --> 00:07:13,089
and I don't like dealing
with people. To wit,

158
00:07:13,172 --> 00:07:15,214
-are we done?
-Oh,

159
00:07:15,297 --> 00:07:16,547
you're "that guy."

160
00:07:16,631 --> 00:07:18,673
What "guy" exactly?

161
00:07:18,756 --> 00:07:21,047
The brooding, arrogant guy

162
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,047
who refuses to take orders?

163
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,964
Self-taught coder
who looks down on

164
00:07:25,047 --> 00:07:26,839
anyone who's
taken a class.

165
00:07:26,923 --> 00:07:28,714
You're probably
an atheist

166
00:07:28,798 --> 00:07:30,923
or something
more contrarian.

167
00:07:31,005 --> 00:07:33,464
You claim to be
an anarcho-capitalist,

168
00:07:33,547 --> 00:07:35,631
but you work here
and pay taxes.

169
00:07:35,714 --> 00:07:39,631
You've probably read half
of Neal Stephenson's
Cryptonomicon,

170
00:07:39,714 --> 00:07:42,798
and it's about 50/50
whether you own a snake.

171
00:07:42,881 --> 00:07:45,714
(whispers):
His girlfriend
owns a snake.

172
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,422
I finished Cryptonomicon,

173
00:07:47,506 --> 00:07:50,339
and you easily could've
just looked in my file.

174
00:07:50,422 --> 00:07:51,839
I didn't need to.

175
00:07:51,923 --> 00:07:54,923
-I'm assigning you five coders.
-Inadvisable.

176
00:07:55,005 --> 00:07:56,339
Noted.

177
00:07:56,422 --> 00:07:58,089
I'll send them over
first thing tomorrow.

178
00:07:58,172 --> 00:08:00,297
If you're going to throw
five randoms under me,

179
00:08:00,381 --> 00:08:02,506
at least let me pick my team.

180
00:08:03,214 --> 00:08:05,005
-Fair enough.
-Good.

181
00:08:05,547 --> 00:08:07,130
-Denpok: Georgia?
-Mm.

182
00:08:07,214 --> 00:08:11,005
You want to move the entire
company to Georgia?

183
00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:14,464
-Why?
-Well, the Valley's become
prohibitively expensive.

184
00:08:14,547 --> 00:08:16,005
Look at these numbers.

185
00:08:16,089 --> 00:08:17,631
If we move to Georgia,

186
00:08:17,714 --> 00:08:20,339
we can save a fortune
and get a further investment.

187
00:08:20,422 --> 00:08:21,464
It's the only way.

188
00:08:21,547 --> 00:08:23,714
Well, I have heard
good things about

189
00:08:23,798 --> 00:08:25,881
the food scene
in the Dirty South.

190
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:27,839
Stankonia. Freaknik.

191
00:08:27,923 --> 00:08:30,547
-Might be nice to be around
more people of color.
-Gavin: What?

192
00:08:30,631 --> 00:08:32,422
Not Atlanta.

193
00:08:32,506 --> 00:08:36,172
Tbilisi. The country of
Georgia, not the state.

194
00:08:36,255 --> 00:08:37,464
What?

195
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:40,297
-Denpok: Gavin?
-Hmm?

196
00:08:40,381 --> 00:08:43,798
Tbilisi is no doubt
a wonderfully rustic place,

197
00:08:43,881 --> 00:08:47,130
but do you not fear losing
a local presence,

198
00:08:47,214 --> 00:08:49,714
a connection with
the beating heart of

199
00:08:49,798 --> 00:08:51,673
the technology industry?

200
00:08:51,756 --> 00:08:53,714
Hoover:
Boots on the ground,
so to speak.

201
00:08:53,798 --> 00:08:55,964
I think it's wise, sir.

202
00:08:57,923 --> 00:09:00,047
Shit. You're right.

203
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:03,089
I need to be here
to maintain my relevance.

204
00:09:03,464 --> 00:09:05,214
All right then. Plan B.

205
00:09:05,297 --> 00:09:08,547
You two and the team
will move to Belarus.

206
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:12,214
If we can get close enough
to the Chernobyl exclusion zone,

207
00:09:12,297 --> 00:09:13,589
it's a buyer's market,

208
00:09:13,673 --> 00:09:15,798
and with the money
we save from substantially

209
00:09:15,881 --> 00:09:17,297
downgrading from Tbilisi,

210
00:09:17,381 --> 00:09:19,839
plus the bigger Belarusian
investment we've been offered,

211
00:09:19,923 --> 00:09:22,589
I'll maintain
a pied-à-terre here in town.

212
00:09:22,673 --> 00:09:25,422
Now, I'll need to rely
much more heavily on you

213
00:09:25,506 --> 00:09:28,089
because you probably
won't see me much.

214
00:09:28,172 --> 00:09:30,005
I'll need you
to guide the troops

215
00:09:30,089 --> 00:09:31,547
and bridge the language gap,

216
00:09:31,631 --> 00:09:33,214
but...

217
00:09:33,297 --> 00:09:35,172
God damn,

218
00:09:35,255 --> 00:09:37,798
I respect the hell
out of you both.

219
00:09:42,422 --> 00:09:44,464
♪ ♪

220
00:09:45,089 --> 00:09:48,422
-Monica: Are you
sure about this?
-(clears throat) Uh...

221
00:09:48,798 --> 00:09:50,255
Yeah. Yeah, no.

222
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:53,589
We can't have that atrocious
game anywhere on our network.

223
00:09:53,673 --> 00:09:55,214
-We have to do a raise.
-Well,

224
00:09:55,297 --> 00:09:58,005
it's a terrible time
to do it, but...

225
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:00,255
I mean,
it's your call.

226
00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:02,089
It's gonna have to be
a big number though.

227
00:10:02,172 --> 00:10:03,464
Yeah, good.

228
00:10:03,547 --> 00:10:05,631
I guess we should set up
some meetings, yeah?

229
00:10:05,714 --> 00:10:08,964
Monica:
Too time-consuming.
Let's jump-start the process.

230
00:10:09,631 --> 00:10:11,673
Are you feeling charitable?

231
00:10:11,756 --> 00:10:14,172
Just 39 cents
a day can literally

232
00:10:14,255 --> 00:10:16,631
feed an entire
family like this.

233
00:10:16,714 --> 00:10:18,839
Think about it,
then ask yourself...

234
00:10:18,923 --> 00:10:21,881
-  (noisy chattering)
-  (mellow jazz playing)

235
00:10:22,673 --> 00:10:25,589
All right, so this place
is the who's who of VCs,

236
00:10:25,673 --> 00:10:27,756
so let's do a lap,
take inventory,

237
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,839
and we'll start
with the biggest firm,
work our way down to--

238
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:33,631
-Laurie!
-Monica. Richard.

239
00:10:33,714 --> 00:10:35,422
What are you doing here?

240
00:10:36,005 --> 00:10:38,130
The same as you, I suppose.

241
00:10:38,214 --> 00:10:40,339
Eating caviar and...

242
00:10:40,422 --> 00:10:41,547
hacking famine.

243
00:10:41,631 --> 00:10:44,714
-No, I thought you
moved to China.
-Mm.

244
00:10:45,214 --> 00:10:47,673
The interesting thing
about moving, Monica,

245
00:10:47,756 --> 00:10:50,964
is that you can do it
more than once. I am back.

246
00:10:51,047 --> 00:10:53,130
You may be
intrigued to know

247
00:10:53,214 --> 00:10:56,756
that I have severed ties
with Yao and YaoNet.

248
00:10:57,214 --> 00:10:58,923
So, you're going
back to VC?

249
00:10:59,005 --> 00:11:00,381
Oh, no.

250
00:11:00,881 --> 00:11:02,506
You misunderstand.

251
00:11:02,589 --> 00:11:05,923
I have severed ties
between Yao and YaoNet.

252
00:11:06,005 --> 00:11:08,172
Yao has been exited,
and I have made myself

253
00:11:08,255 --> 00:11:09,422
the CEO of the company,

254
00:11:09,506 --> 00:11:11,714
which I am moving
back to the US,

255
00:11:11,798 --> 00:11:15,381
and in order to make it
sound more American,

256
00:11:15,464 --> 00:11:16,881
I am renaming it

257
00:11:16,964 --> 00:11:18,506
"YaoNetUS."

258
00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:20,714
Wait. So, you're
launching here?

259
00:11:20,798 --> 00:11:23,130
Yes, and with those
Chinese out of the way,

260
00:11:23,214 --> 00:11:25,839
I can finally be more
ruthlessly efficient.

261
00:11:25,923 --> 00:11:27,089
Speaking of,

262
00:11:27,172 --> 00:11:28,756
excuse me.

263
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:33,589
-What? Are you
fucking kidding me?
-Richard,

264
00:11:33,673 --> 00:11:36,172
relax, okay,
she's got inferior tech,

265
00:11:36,255 --> 00:11:37,798
she's got no developers.
You remember when

266
00:11:37,881 --> 00:11:41,255
she tried to run Eklow?
She's gonna last a week as CEO.

267
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:43,673
I mean, look at her.
She's desperate.

268
00:11:43,756 --> 00:11:45,381
She's already
in total flirt mode.

269
00:11:45,464 --> 00:11:47,255
I do believe with
proper management...

270
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,005
Monica:
She needs money just like we do.

271
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:51,255
Let's just worry
about us, okay?

272
00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:54,130
I will introduce you,
and just...

273
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,297
let me do
the talking, okay?

274
00:11:56,381 --> 00:11:57,589
Don't speak until--

275
00:11:57,673 --> 00:11:59,297
Richard Hendricks
from Pied Piper.

276
00:11:59,381 --> 00:12:01,881
-Eric Rivera, Graves Partners.
-Richard: Oh.

277
00:12:01,964 --> 00:12:03,923
I saw your
congressional testimony,

278
00:12:04,005 --> 00:12:05,381
and I thought, man,

279
00:12:05,464 --> 00:12:07,381
I really need
to talk to that guy.

280
00:12:07,464 --> 00:12:09,047
Oh, you did? Huh, cool.

281
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:11,172
Yeah. I mean,
you committed

282
00:12:11,255 --> 00:12:13,464
to a really bad business model,

283
00:12:13,547 --> 00:12:15,297
on national TV.

284
00:12:15,381 --> 00:12:16,881
I guess I just wanted to know,

285
00:12:16,964 --> 00:12:18,506
what the hell were you thinking?

286
00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:20,297
I mean, picking a fight
with Facebook is one thing,

287
00:12:20,381 --> 00:12:22,964
but shitting on Google
and Amazon at the same time,

288
00:12:23,047 --> 00:12:26,047
in front of TV cameras?
What was going on in your brain?

289
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:28,297
And-and Hooli. I-I shit
on them, too, so...

290
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:30,464
I mean, we're all sitting in
front of the TV in our office,

291
00:12:30,547 --> 00:12:33,255
thinking this is
the dumbest man in tech.

292
00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:35,214
And then we talked about it,
and we realized, hang on,

293
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:37,422
-that is totally unfair.
-Yeah, you did? Good.

294
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:40,506
Yeah, because, I mean,
you were subpoenaed, right?
You were under oath?

295
00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:43,297
-What were you supposed to do?
-Technically, I don't...

296
00:12:43,381 --> 00:12:45,714
You weren't...
you weren't under oath?

297
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:47,172
Mm, I don't think so.

298
00:12:47,255 --> 00:12:48,631
Are you kidding me?

299
00:12:48,714 --> 00:12:51,047
Wait. Karl, Ben!
Come over here.
You gotta hear this.

300
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:53,589
We were wrong, man!
Tell them what you just told me.

301
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:56,339
(chattering)

302
00:12:57,756 --> 00:12:59,089
Hey, um--

303
00:12:59,172 --> 00:13:01,130
Richard Hendricks,
from Pied Piper, yes?

304
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:02,255
Uh, no.

305
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:04,839
Maximo Reyes.
I am an investor from Chile.

306
00:13:05,214 --> 00:13:07,839
Wow, I gotta tell you,
it is an honor
to meet you, man.

307
00:13:07,923 --> 00:13:10,631
Truly, I am such a big fan
of your technology.

308
00:13:10,714 --> 00:13:12,297
Wow.

309
00:13:12,381 --> 00:13:15,339
-What, like, really, or...
-Of course. Hi.

310
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:18,756
We are shaking hands.

311
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,130
Correct?

312
00:13:20,214 --> 00:13:22,297
But I'm sure you have more
important people to talk to,

313
00:13:22,381 --> 00:13:24,297
you know, and, you have
made it painfully clear

314
00:13:24,381 --> 00:13:26,047
that you do not want
me as an investor, so--

315
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:29,297
No, h-hold on.
Wait, I-I-I made it clear?
When did I--

316
00:13:29,381 --> 00:13:31,214
Oh no, not you personally,
but I spoke with somebody

317
00:13:31,297 --> 00:13:32,631
from your company many times.

318
00:13:32,714 --> 00:13:33,923
Uh, Yarez?

319
00:13:34,005 --> 00:13:35,047
Yarez?

320
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:36,798
Y-Yarez Dun...

321
00:13:36,881 --> 00:13:38,172
Yarez-- Oh!

322
00:13:38,255 --> 00:13:39,839
-Jared.
-Yes!

323
00:13:39,923 --> 00:13:41,422
-Whatever...
-Potatoes, potatoes.

324
00:13:41,506 --> 00:13:45,130
Well, uh, Yared doesn't really
work with us anymore, so...

325
00:13:45,214 --> 00:13:47,714
-Oh, wow. Well, then.
-Yeah.

326
00:13:47,798 --> 00:13:49,297
Look at you and me.

327
00:13:49,381 --> 00:13:51,255
-We are talking.
-(laughs)

328
00:13:51,339 --> 00:13:53,798
Have you ever had
a Chilean terremoto  ?

329
00:13:53,881 --> 00:13:56,339
-Hoover: Denpok, got a minute?
-Denpok: Yes.

330
00:13:56,422 --> 00:13:59,714
I may have a way
to keep us here in the US.

331
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,422
Talk.

332
00:14:02,881 --> 00:14:04,756
Are you familiar with CIFIUS?

333
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:06,714
Yes.

334
00:14:07,297 --> 00:14:08,381
No.

335
00:14:08,464 --> 00:14:11,255
The Committee on Foreign
Investment in the US,

336
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:12,798
or CIFIUS,

337
00:14:12,881 --> 00:14:16,005
is a federal agency
that has wide latitude

338
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:17,673
to prevent American companies

339
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:19,172
-from doing business
with foreigners,

340
00:14:19,255 --> 00:14:21,839
if there's a national
security threat.

341
00:14:21,923 --> 00:14:24,589
Are you familiar with
the dating app Grindr?

342
00:14:24,673 --> 00:14:26,047
No.

343
00:14:27,964 --> 00:14:29,089
Yes.

344
00:14:29,673 --> 00:14:32,339
Last year,
CIFIUS reversed the sale

345
00:14:32,422 --> 00:14:34,756
of Grindr to Chinese investors.

346
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:38,506
They ruled that the sexual
and HIV status of US citizens

347
00:14:38,589 --> 00:14:40,005
was something
they needed to keep

348
00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:42,422
out of the hands

00:22:18,214 --> 00:22:19,172
That's you.

-I-I know

00:22:22,756 --> 00:22:25,172
your job changed over time,

527
00:22:25,255 --> 00:22:26,923
but we can undo that.

528
00:22:27,005 --> 00:22:28,339
You know, restructure your role,

529
00:22:28,422 --> 00:22:30,381

so you're closer to me.

We'll be...

back in business.

00:22:35,631 --> 00:22:38,339
Richard, it's too late.
I mean,

534
00:22:38,422 --> 00:22:40,464
you know, you let me go,
so I took the job here

535
00:22:40,547 --> 00:22:42,714
-with Gwart, and--
-So?

536
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:45,673
Go inside and tell
Gwart you're leaving.

how loyalty works.

538

I mean, that
wouldn't be fair.

539
00:22:49,506 --> 00:22:51,130
Fair?

540
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:55,005
Years ago,
you came to this house,

541
00:22:55,089 --> 00:22:57,547
begging me for a job,
and I gave you one.

542
00:22:57,631 --> 00:23:00,839
In fact, I made you COO.
And now,

543
00:23:00,923 --> 00:23:03,798
when I need you the most,
you stab me in the back,

544
00:23:03,881 --> 00:23:06,923
and you have the balls
to lecture me about loyalty?

545
00:23:07,005 --> 00:23:09,464
Are you fucking
kidding me?

546
00:23:09,547 --> 00:23:10,714

just leave this house,

responsible for my behavior.
