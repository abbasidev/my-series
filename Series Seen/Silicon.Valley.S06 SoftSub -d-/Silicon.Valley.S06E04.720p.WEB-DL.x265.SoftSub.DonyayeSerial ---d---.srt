1
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:13,606
All we wanted was
Foxhole,

2
00:00:13,778 --> 00:00:16,153
and instead we got
all these Hooli people.

3
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,931
We really couldn't just
fire them, sight unseen?

4
00:00:19,026 --> 00:00:21,799
Uh-uh. Tracy from HR
has to do an assessment

5
00:00:21,887 --> 00:00:25,231
of each person first,
then we should can them.

6
00:00:26,058 --> 00:00:28,940
Oh, hey. I think I know
that guy. Uh, yeah.

7
00:00:29,028 --> 00:00:30,792
What are you doing?
Did you just wave him in?

8
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,820
I-I don't know,
automatic social shit.

9
00:00:33,684 --> 00:00:35,156
Hey, Ethan!
Uh...

10
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:37,240
- What are you doing here?
- You tell me, boss.

11
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:40,104
Uh, Ethan was my first
manager when I was at Hooli.

12
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:41,365
I didn't know you
still worked there.

13
00:00:41,452 --> 00:00:44,559
Yeah, well, we can't all
invent middle-out compression.

14
00:00:44,674 --> 00:00:47,348
Uh, anyway, I-I hope
I make the cut.

15
00:00:47,444 --> 00:00:51,955
Yeah, well, we're having to be
creative with the merger, so...

16
00:00:52,043 --> 00:00:54,607
Yeah, totally.
That's why I figured I could maybe help.

17
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:58,098
You could use Hooli OS for
your entire mobile suite.

18
00:00:58,201 --> 00:01:00,036
Yeah, we're not gonna
spend months porting

19
00:01:00,124 --> 00:01:02,335
Hooli software over
to our protocol, so...

20
00:01:02,423 --> 00:01:04,817
- But thanks.
- Yeah, it was a good thought.

21
00:01:04,905 --> 00:01:07,168
Yeah, you wouldn't have to.

22
00:01:07,278 --> 00:01:10,403
When we iterated Hooli
OS 11, we reengineered

23
00:01:10,522 --> 00:01:12,691
the entire network
layer to be compatible

24
00:01:12,779 --> 00:01:15,608
with other protocols...
and you own it.

25
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:17,650
How quickly,
would you say,

26
00:01:17,737 --> 00:01:19,911
you could, um, make it
work with PiperNet?

27
00:01:20,028 --> 00:01:22,859
A few weeks with
almost zero refactor.

28
00:01:22,946 --> 00:01:25,362
How much money do you think
that could save us?

29
00:01:26,195 --> 00:01:27,942
So you guys are planning
to build your own

30
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:30,153
external antennas to deploy
for the Hawaii test?

31
00:01:30,241 --> 00:01:32,238
- Why?
- The zero-start problem.

32
00:01:32,362 --> 00:01:34,608
Until we have a critical
mass of users,

33
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:37,775
iOS and Android devices
don't have enough range.

34
00:01:37,862 --> 00:01:40,483
Right, of course not,
but push-to-talk HooliPhones do.

35
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:41,775
HooliPhones?

36
00:01:41,887 --> 00:01:44,400
You want us to roll out
our network on push-to-talk,

37
00:01:44,487 --> 00:01:46,145
janky-ass HooliPhones?

38
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:48,557
Laugh it up, but,
uh, the fact that

39
00:01:48,645 --> 00:01:51,315
they still have low power,
omnidirectional antennas

40
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:53,233
means they have
a radius of four miles.

41
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,911
What is your antenna's range?

42
00:01:55,247 --> 00:01:56,900
- One mile?
- Wrong.

43
00:01:57,215 --> 00:01:59,129
One-point-one-five.

44
00:01:59,356 --> 00:02:00,779
Okay. Line of sight, though.

45
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:03,079
- Maybe.
- Richard,

46
00:02:03,214 --> 00:02:05,502
you guys just bought
250,000 HooliPhones.

47
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:09,169
Instead of spending more money on
expensive and mediocre antennas,

48
00:02:09,317 --> 00:02:12,106
why not just give away
HooliPhones for the test?

49
00:02:12,635 --> 00:02:14,089
Delete.

50
00:02:15,004 --> 00:02:16,338
You know, Ethan, could you

51
00:02:16,426 --> 00:02:19,465
walk us through the Hooli OS
side of all this work?

52
00:02:19,553 --> 00:02:21,518
Yeah, totally,
but I think it'd go faster

53
00:02:21,606 --> 00:02:23,400
if I just took point
and your guys backed me up.

54
00:02:23,487 --> 00:02:25,661
I'm sorry, what do you
mean, back you up?

55
00:02:25,749 --> 00:02:27,900
Guys, we are
in a huge hole here.

56
00:02:27,987 --> 00:02:30,150
Whatever it takes
to get us out of it, please.

57
00:02:30,403 --> 00:02:32,942
Um, why don't you talk
to Tracy in HR,

58
00:02:33,029 --> 00:02:34,955
and you can get
your start-paperwork.

59
00:02:35,043 --> 00:02:37,622
Cool! Looks I already earned my
keep, huh, Patches?

60
00:02:38,356 --> 00:02:39,731
Patches.

61
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:41,608
Yeah. Oh, that's weird
that you remember that.

62
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:44,817
Um, so, Patches.
I'll tell them.

63
00:02:45,017 --> 00:02:46,554
Uh, first
day at Hooli,

64
00:02:46,642 --> 00:02:49,439
I wore this sweater that had
these, like, elbow pads on it.

65
00:02:49,527 --> 00:02:51,536
- Anyway, uh...
- HooliPhones?

66
00:02:51,878 --> 00:02:53,440
Are you fucking serious?

67
00:02:53,528 --> 00:02:56,010
You just laid down and let
that guy roll all over us.

68
00:02:56,098 --> 00:02:58,733
Look, I don't wanna use Hooli
shit anymore than you guys,

69
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,775
but this is for the greater
good of the company.

70
00:03:00,862 --> 00:03:02,559
This will get us
to a working test.

71
00:03:02,647 --> 00:03:04,231
This will get us to Hawaii.

72
00:03:05,829 --> 00:03:07,770
Hey! Holden.

73
00:03:07,973 --> 00:03:09,458
I asked for a water.

76
00:03:20,812 --> 00:03:22,301
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

77
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:25,190
Oh... Laurie.

78
00:03:25,395 --> 00:03:27,340
This will be sound.
Excuse me one minute.

79
00:03:27,428 --> 00:03:30,239
- Laurie.
- Oh, Monica.

80
00:03:31,463 --> 00:03:33,208
- Hello.
- Hi.

81
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:36,001
I'm now using touch as a means
to communicate friendship.

82
00:03:36,315 --> 00:03:38,103
Uh-huh.

83
00:03:38,191 --> 00:03:41,104
Hey, um, is
that Kara Swisher?

84
00:03:41,192 --> 00:03:42,424
What do guys do in there?

85
00:03:42,512 --> 00:03:45,002
We are uplifting each other
while we plan our annual

86
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,778
Women in Tech Empowerment panel.
Kara's moderating.

87
00:03:48,034 --> 00:03:49,604
Oh my God.
Is that Susan...

88
00:03:49,692 --> 00:03:52,504
Susan Wojcicki from YouTube.
Don't point, it's unseemly.

89
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:55,627
Laurie, you do know
that I am the CFO

90
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,534
of a prominent tech company
and just personally led

91
00:03:58,622 --> 00:04:00,987
- the acquisition of Hooli?
- Yes, I am aware.

92
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:04,233
My partner Maximo is,
hmm... unpleased.

93
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,434
I'm just saying,
I-I would love to do the panel.

94
00:04:07,522 --> 00:04:10,010
Why? You don't mentor,
you don't volunteer,

95
00:04:10,098 --> 00:04:11,567
you don't develop
programs for women.

96
00:04:11,654 --> 00:04:13,919
You've never shown the slightest
interest in supporting women.

97
00:04:14,006 --> 00:04:15,723
Of course I have!
Which is why

98
00:04:15,811 --> 00:04:18,849
I wanna do your panel with
Susan Wojcicki from YouTube.

99
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:20,200
Well...

100
00:04:20,311 --> 00:04:22,391
we do have a lot
of funny people.

101
00:04:22,482 --> 00:04:24,645
You could add... balance.

102
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:31,031
Are you eating
the entire leaf?

103
00:04:31,119 --> 00:04:34,661
It's amazing how wasteful
people in the West can be.

104
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:38,918
Hoover.

105
00:04:39,161 --> 00:04:42,051
This book will send shockwaves
throughout the Valley.

106
00:04:44,862 --> 00:04:48,071
Cold Ice Cream
and Hot Kisses.

107
00:04:49,112 --> 00:04:51,098
This is about your
experience at Hooli?

108
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:53,004
No, no.
It's a coming-of-age story

109
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:55,385
about a lost,
yet handsome teen

110
00:04:55,473 --> 00:04:57,817
growing up
one fateful summer in Maine.

111
00:04:58,395 --> 00:05:00,127
Now, get that
to the publishers.

112
00:05:00,215 --> 00:05:03,661
I want the hardback in my hand
by tomorrow lunchtime.

113
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,590
Sir, it takes
a bit longer than that.

114
00:05:05,737 --> 00:05:09,237
We have to send it out to publishing
houses and then find an editor.

115
00:05:09,325 --> 00:05:12,191
Editors are for people who can't
write correctly the first time.

116
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:13,918
We'll self-publish.

117
00:05:14,567 --> 00:05:16,275
And this really isn't
about tech?

118
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:19,497
No.
I've left tech for good.

119
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:22,918
Now, I have a chance
to do something important.

120
00:05:23,044 --> 00:05:25,340
Write a thinly veiled
roman à clef

121
00:05:25,452 --> 00:05:27,866
set in a whale-themed
B and B.

122
00:05:28,402 --> 00:05:31,330
So look, Monica, um,
I was looking over the org chart,

123
00:05:31,418 --> 00:05:34,942
and I think I'm gonna put
you in charge of Foxhole.

124
00:05:35,684 --> 00:05:36,721
- What?
- Yeah.

125
00:05:36,809 --> 00:05:38,400
I mean, while I know
that you and I were saying

126
00:05:38,487 --> 00:05:42,510
that maybe some people might find
it a little misogynist or offensive.

127
00:05:42,598 --> 00:05:45,483
I think that we if we had
a woman at the helm,

128
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:48,483
it might change the optics,
and since you don't really care...

129
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:52,284
No, I-I-I do care.
I care deeply.

130
00:05:52,372 --> 00:05:55,411
No, you don't. I mean,
you literally said,

131
00:05:55,612 --> 00:05:57,604
"If a bunch of dumb
Marines wanna cheat

132
00:05:57,692 --> 00:05:59,653
on their dumb wives,
what the fuck do I care?"

133
00:05:59,754 --> 00:06:02,137
I don't think I used
those exact words.

134
00:06:02,316 --> 00:06:04,190
I'm pretty sure
you did, actually.

135
00:06:04,278 --> 00:06:06,457
- You texted it to me last night, see?
- No, but...

136
00:06:06,627 --> 00:06:08,065
And then you also said,

137
00:06:08,153 --> 00:06:10,463
"We don't have to smell it.
We just have to sell it.

138
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:12,358
- As long as those fat fat fatties..."
- Okay.

139
00:06:12,445 --> 00:06:14,233
I took an Ambien
last night, and probably

140
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,278
should've turned off my phone.
Can you delete those?

141
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:20,065
Okay. Monica,
just make it work.

142
00:06:20,153 --> 00:06:22,239
Please? For women.

143
00:06:24,862 --> 00:06:26,071
Hi.

144
00:06:28,887 --> 00:06:30,786
Bertram Gilfoyle?

145
00:06:33,641 --> 00:06:34,864
No.

146
00:06:35,141 --> 00:06:37,141
I'm John.

147
00:06:37,924 --> 00:06:39,090
Okay.

148
00:06:40,611 --> 00:06:43,434
I brought the HooliPhones.
Would you like to see them?

149
00:06:43,662 --> 00:06:46,387
I was told to help you
with integration.

150
00:06:48,385 --> 00:06:50,298
You know what, John?

151
00:06:51,059 --> 00:06:52,575
That would be grand.

152
00:06:57,821 --> 00:06:59,872
Okay, here they are.

153
00:07:00,239 --> 00:07:04,082
The push-to-talk
HooliPhone 13-X.

154
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:07,481
Here's a HooliPhone
right here.

155
00:07:09,265 --> 00:07:11,793
And here's a HooliPhone
right here.

156
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,598
- And here's a...
- Stop talking.

157
00:07:15,738 --> 00:07:17,301
Sit in that chair.

158
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:20,645
Do not touch or say anything.

159
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:26,739
Okay.

160
00:07:28,324 --> 00:07:29,685
Oh my God.

161
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,604
Gwart, do you remember
how I-I told you

162
00:07:32,692 --> 00:07:35,965
I found my birth father in that
militia in the Ozarks, but...

163
00:07:36,343 --> 00:07:38,653
then it turned out
that guy was a fraud?

164
00:07:39,089 --> 00:07:42,479
Well, um, I just went in
for some genetic testing

165
00:07:42,567 --> 00:07:45,088
to-to confirm my diagnosis
of Marfan syndrome,

166
00:07:45,176 --> 00:07:49,567
and it turns out that
my real parents are alive.

167
00:07:50,098 --> 00:07:51,984
And they live in Santa Cruz.

168
00:07:52,286 --> 00:07:54,525
And they're
still together.

169
00:07:54,612 --> 00:07:57,195
What should I do?
Should I visit them?

170
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,016
Are you upset?

171
00:08:02,179 --> 00:08:05,179
Should I have not allowed
somebody to sit so close?

172
00:08:05,671 --> 00:08:08,172
Because I-I asked you
if it was okay.

173
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,302
If you had an issue,
you could've...

174
00:08:12,207 --> 00:08:14,469
No. No.

175
00:08:15,872 --> 00:08:18,500
It is my job to protect you.

176
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,453
That is my responsibility.

177
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,258
I shouldn't have put
you in that position.

178
00:08:22,563 --> 00:08:25,203
I apologize.
Do you forgive me?

179
00:08:29,235 --> 00:08:30,539
Yeah!

180
00:08:30,627 --> 00:08:32,664
Yeah, you're right!

181
00:08:32,758 --> 00:08:35,357
I'll be splitting you guys
into teams of four,

182
00:08:35,477 --> 00:08:38,650
then giving you guys different
test scenarios. Hey, Patches!

183
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,483
Hey! Uh, Holden said that we
were having this thing upstairs.

184
00:08:41,571 --> 00:08:43,652
Yeah, I moved it down here.
It's just a better space.

185
00:08:43,828 --> 00:08:45,171
Go ahead, have a seat.
You're over there.

186
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:46,931
I said we should wait
for you to start, but...

187
00:08:47,018 --> 00:08:49,318
The clock is ticking, though, right?
We have stuff to do.

188
00:08:49,406 --> 00:08:50,500
Busy, busy.

189
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,281
Oh.

190
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:55,524
Elbow pads.
Weird. Yeah, okay.

191
00:08:55,612 --> 00:08:57,103
Uh, actually, the first day
I was at Hooli...

192
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:59,586
Yeah, I told them. I told them.
They all laughed.

193
00:08:59,674 --> 00:09:01,337
Oh. Heh.

194
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,147
Come on,
put it on, Patches.

195
00:09:03,235 --> 00:09:06,453
- I don't wanna put it on.
- Do it! Be fun!

196
00:09:07,737 --> 00:09:10,070
Yeah, okay, sure.
I can be fun.

197
00:09:10,695 --> 00:09:11,953
It's kinda funny, I guess.

198
00:09:12,893 --> 00:09:14,920
Yes!
There he is!

199
00:09:15,008 --> 00:09:17,555
There's our Patches!

200
00:09:18,116 --> 00:09:19,983
Hey, listen, Richard.

201
00:09:20,071 --> 00:09:21,556
You know I'm just joking
around with you, right?

202
00:09:21,643 --> 00:09:24,389
We're all just having fun.
Thanks for being a good sport, okay?

203
00:09:24,477 --> 00:09:26,586
Sure. No problem.
Okay. Back to it.

204
00:09:26,674 --> 00:09:28,844
Right! Okay,
so as I was saying,

205
00:09:28,932 --> 00:09:30,858
with smaller groups,

206
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:32,953
we'll be able to make
faster decisions, right?

207
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:35,235
Light on our feet.
For example,

208
00:09:35,531 --> 00:09:38,391
do we think this photo
of Richard is funny?

209
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,563
We do, don't we?

210
00:09:41,037 --> 00:09:42,370
God...

211
00:09:43,226 --> 00:09:44,893
We do!

212
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:47,857
Okay. Cool, uh,
guilty as charged.

213
00:09:47,945 --> 00:09:49,203
Big cake lover.
You got me.

214
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:51,287
Yeah. Well, I mean,
I was your boss for a year,

215
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:54,248
so you know I have some funny photos
of you squirreled away, right?

216
00:09:54,336 --> 00:09:57,498
Uh, I didn't know that was a thing
bosses did, but, yeah, maybe.

217
00:09:57,586 --> 00:10:00,692
Speaking of which,
did you write that?

218
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,817
- Ooh!
- Oh, my God.

219
00:10:02,904 --> 00:10:04,818
And sorted list
size is greater than

220
00:10:04,906 --> 00:10:06,047
plus, plus index?

221
00:10:06,143 --> 00:10:08,811
You ran a brute force
search on a sorted list?

222
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,617
Look, guys, it was
my first day, and...

223
00:10:11,781 --> 00:10:14,274
- I was nervous, and I was hurrying, so...
- Really?

224
00:10:14,362 --> 00:10:18,102
That's why you decided to write
the slowest subroutine in history?

225
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:22,053
Anyone could've made
that mistake.

226
00:10:22,141 --> 00:10:25,061
Yeah, it's true.
In fact, I could ask for a show of hands,

227
00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:27,241
but instead of doing that,
uh, I'll just, uh...

228
00:10:27,329 --> 00:10:28,985
Could you have made that mistake?

229
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,202
Could you have
made that mistake?

230
00:10:30,289 --> 00:10:31,913
Could you have
made that mistake?

231
00:10:32,001 --> 00:10:33,817
- Okay.
- Could you have made that mistake?

232
00:10:33,904 --> 00:10:37,092
The joke is that he's doing a
brute force search of the room.

233
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:40,532
- Yeah, I know.
- Then, why did you do it?

234
00:10:41,905 --> 00:10:44,023
Could you have made
that mistake?

235
00:10:44,474 --> 00:10:46,352
Richard,
what the fuck was that?

236
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:48,990
It was just...
Ethan being Ethan.

237
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:51,942
He was acting like your boss, and you
were acting like his noob employee.

238
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:54,608
No. Everyone knows
I'm the boss.

239
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:57,641
I think people were just excited to,
you know, Razz the CEO.

240
00:10:57,729 --> 00:10:59,809
- It's all in good fun.
- I did not have fun.

241
00:10:59,987 --> 00:11:02,109
I watched you get kicked
in the balls for 90 minutes.

242
00:11:02,196 --> 00:11:04,233
My balls hurt sympathetically
for your balls.

243
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,237
Take off that sweater!

244
00:11:08,862 --> 00:11:10,191
It's fine.

245
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:13,272
I mean, yes, Ethan
can be a little prickly,

246
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,941
but he is gonna get us
to where we need to be.

247
00:11:16,029 --> 00:11:19,219
And I don't mind putting my ego
aside for the good of the company.

248
00:11:19,307 --> 00:11:21,459
That guy humiliating you
was not good for the company.

249
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:24,071
He dominated you like
a silverback gorilla.

250
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:27,066
Do you know why the gorillas
respected Jane Goodall?

251
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:29,626
- Jane Goodall studied chimpanzees.
- Wrong!

252
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:32,579
It's because she could kick
their ass, and they knew it.

253
00:11:32,688 --> 00:11:35,438
You need to assert dominance
like Jane Goodall.

254
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,024
I have something
to show you.

255
00:11:37,243 --> 00:11:39,128
You're gonna need this.

256
00:11:46,701 --> 00:11:50,899
This is a video
of maximizing alphaness.

257
00:11:54,735 --> 00:11:56,334
What else happens?

258
00:11:56,422 --> 00:11:59,025
It's just this,
then it repeats itself.

259
00:11:59,112 --> 00:12:00,579
You just
kind of breathe

260
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:02,758
and subconsciously
absorb it.

261
00:12:03,987 --> 00:12:06,942
Dinesh, this is the dumbest
thing I've ever seen.

262
00:12:07,274 --> 00:12:08,820
Fuck yeah.

263
00:12:17,067 --> 00:12:18,693
Hey, John.

264
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:21,005
Yeah?

265
00:12:21,987 --> 00:12:25,358
Could you grab
my extra spudger?

266
00:12:25,821 --> 00:12:27,219
I think it's on my desk,

267
00:12:27,307 --> 00:12:29,258
next to my chess board.

268
00:12:30,086 --> 00:12:31,461
Okay.

269
00:12:37,565 --> 00:12:40,211
Cthulu limited edition, huh?

270
00:12:41,088 --> 00:12:43,040
- That's right.
- Huh.

271
00:12:45,221 --> 00:12:46,665
Anything else?

272
00:12:47,896 --> 00:12:49,157
Nope.

273
00:12:51,953 --> 00:12:53,258
Okay.

274
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:57,594
I am so glad
we could do this.

275
00:12:57,705 --> 00:12:59,008
Yeah.

276
00:12:59,609 --> 00:13:01,243
What are we doing,
exactly?

277
00:13:01,331 --> 00:13:04,319
Well, I have had my eye
on you for a while now.

278
00:13:04,407 --> 00:13:08,477
It's what I like to call,
"mentoring from a distance."

279
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:11,014
We haven't spoken more
than five words to each other

280
00:13:11,102 --> 00:13:12,430
since you joined
the company.

281
00:13:12,518 --> 00:13:14,008
That's
the distance part!

282
00:13:14,096 --> 00:13:16,357
Look, I-I came
here to talk about

283
00:13:16,445 --> 00:13:18,061
advancing
the careers of women,

284
00:13:18,149 --> 00:13:20,483
specifically yours.

285
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:23,358
- Do you know how we just acquired Foxhole?
- Of course.

286
00:13:23,445 --> 00:13:25,530
Apparently, it's 90% men,

287
00:13:25,618 --> 00:13:28,985
and almost all the female
users are prostitutes.

288
00:13:29,154 --> 00:13:31,751
Which makes it a very
challenging assignment.

289
00:13:32,364 --> 00:13:33,724
It's also a big promotion

290
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:36,101
and strategically
important to the company.

291
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:38,775
And it's yours,
if you want it.

292
00:13:38,862 --> 00:13:40,954
But, I mean, if you don't
think you can handle it,

293
00:13:41,138 --> 00:13:43,553
I can just check in
with Becky, Nadia,

294
00:13:43,641 --> 00:13:45,029
- Dani...
- No!

295
00:13:45,703 --> 00:13:47,665
I can do it.

296
00:13:47,823 --> 00:13:50,680
Awesome! For you!

297
00:13:53,237 --> 00:13:54,758
Caspian's heart
cracked open

298
00:13:54,846 --> 00:13:57,633
like one of his father's
briny lobster traps.

299
00:13:57,805 --> 00:13:59,884
"Hannah," he whispered.

300
00:14:00,097 --> 00:14:03,263
"I am not..."

301
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:08,816
"Hannah," he whispered.
"I am not a member

302
00:14:08,904 --> 00:14:11,055
"of the prestigious
Prout's Neck Yacht Club.

303
00:14:11,143 --> 00:14:14,055
"Truth be told, I am but a..."

304
00:14:16,453 --> 00:14:20,100
"Truth be told, I am
but a lowly man of the sea.

305
00:14:20,188 --> 00:14:22,753
She..."

306
00:14:24,151 --> 00:14:27,064
"She was my mistress,
but now, I pray

307
00:14:27,152 --> 00:14:29,415
that you might be as well?"

308
00:14:32,719 --> 00:14:34,177
Thank you.

309
00:14:35,907 --> 00:14:38,067
- Name?
- Oh, I don't want to buy your book.

310
00:14:38,154 --> 00:14:40,722
I'm Allie Abrams, arts editor
at the Sacramento Bee.

311
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,922
Do you have a minute
for a quick interview?

312
00:14:44,671 --> 00:14:46,129
I'll make the time.

313
00:14:47,842 --> 00:14:49,805
Is it on? Running?

314
00:14:50,312 --> 00:14:52,883
Firstly, I work in the parlor.

315
00:14:53,109 --> 00:14:56,469
I use a 1968 IBM Selectric II.

316
00:14:56,557 --> 00:14:58,386
In fact,
the tapping of the keys

317
00:14:58,528 --> 00:15:01,211
inspired the idea
for Lana's blindness.

318
00:15:01,299 --> 00:15:03,254
The tapping of her cane,
you see?

319
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:04,987
Oh.

320
00:15:05,366 --> 00:15:07,071
I guess what I really
want to know is,

321
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:08,781
why isn't this
book about tech?

322
00:15:09,071 --> 00:15:10,258
I'm an author.

323
00:15:10,356 --> 00:15:13,376
Would you ask John Grisham the
same question, or Jackie Collins?

324
00:15:13,547 --> 00:15:16,350
Well, no, but they weren't the
head of a failed tech company.

325
00:15:16,438 --> 00:15:18,024
You think I failed.

326
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:20,280
I didn't fail tech.

327
00:15:20,429 --> 00:15:21,884
Tech failed me.

328
00:15:21,972 --> 00:15:24,760
Tech failed all of us.
Look.

329
00:15:25,227 --> 00:15:26,859
We should be
in a Waldenbooks,

330
00:15:26,946 --> 00:15:30,025
but we're here,
in this decrepit shithole, and why?

331
00:15:30,112 --> 00:15:33,008
Because people buy books
online, thanks to Hool...

332
00:15:33,215 --> 00:15:34,504
Amazon.

333
00:15:34,646 --> 00:15:36,665
So, don't point fingers at me.

334
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,548
I didn't write about tech

335
00:15:38,745 --> 00:15:40,742
because tech destroys worlds,

336
00:15:40,837 --> 00:15:43,290
and I,
I wanted to create them.

337
00:15:48,358 --> 00:15:50,692
May I have a token
for the restroom, please?

338
00:15:51,237 --> 00:15:53,704
Well, there's not
a whole lot to the story.

339
00:15:53,868 --> 00:15:55,038
Once you came along,

340
00:15:55,126 --> 00:15:57,984
Susan and I realized
the timing was not right,

341
00:15:58,071 --> 00:15:59,508
and we needed to give you up.

342
00:15:59,695 --> 00:16:03,650
I appreciate how difficult
that must've been for you guys.

343
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:06,751
One of the hardest decisions
we ever had to make.

344
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,727
Um, thank you.

345
00:16:09,063 --> 00:16:10,514
And I just want you to know,

346
00:16:10,617 --> 00:16:13,805
that I understand
and I don't hold it

347
00:16:13,893 --> 00:16:15,673
against you at all.

348
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,251
You guys had kids after me?

349
00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:25,086
- Well, one was after.
- Pardon?

350
00:16:25,406 --> 00:16:27,607
- Pete and Lisa were before you.
- Right.

351
00:16:27,774 --> 00:16:29,352
I don't understand.
You...

352
00:16:29,987 --> 00:16:33,352
I was your third child,
and-and you... you gave me up?

353
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,493
Yeah.

354
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,858
- It just got way too difficult for us.
- Mm. Yeah.

355
00:16:36,946 --> 00:16:38,692
Couldn't go
on as many flights.

356
00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:41,923
Two parents, two kids...
That's a clear row across.

357
00:16:42,011 --> 00:16:44,969
- Yeah.
- 1A, B, C, and D.

358
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:50,079
So, you gave me up to simplify
your first-class air travel?

359
00:16:50,266 --> 00:16:52,819
- Oh. No, it's more complicated than that.
- Yeah.

360
00:16:52,907 --> 00:16:55,069
- Yeah, we had car travel,
- Mm-hmm.

361
00:16:55,157 --> 00:16:56,483
- And taxis.
- Mm-hmm.

362
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:58,907
We never really did
travel by train.

363
00:16:59,028 --> 00:17:00,751
No, and I don't do boats,
so...

364
00:17:00,855 --> 00:17:03,157
Well, you did enjoy
that trip down the Rhine.

365
00:17:03,253 --> 00:17:05,249
I... said I did.

366
00:17:05,352 --> 00:17:07,163
Oh, you!

367
00:17:07,251 --> 00:17:09,705
Anyway, when we gave you up,
we realized...

368
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,330
- we had a huge mistake.
- You did?

369
00:17:12,487 --> 00:17:15,900
Yeah. We realized we actually
did want a third child.

370
00:17:15,987 --> 00:17:17,942
- Yep.
- Started trying almost immediately,

371
00:17:18,029 --> 00:17:21,471
and we lucked out because
Donald is the best of the bunch.

372
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:22,764
Yeah.

373
00:17:22,901 --> 00:17:24,781
- Donald?
- Yeah, we love that name,

374
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:26,524
so we just wanted
to use it again.

375
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:29,776
- Oh! Speak of the angels, they're here.
- They're here.

376
00:17:29,864 --> 00:17:33,086
Wait, you invited
my birth siblings here?

377
00:17:33,174 --> 00:17:34,518
To meet me?

378
00:17:35,779 --> 00:17:37,316
- Hi, Mama.
- Hey.

379
00:17:37,403 --> 00:17:38,479
This is Peter.

380
00:17:38,567 --> 00:17:40,315
This is Lisa.
This is Donald.

381
00:17:40,403 --> 00:17:43,016
And this is, uh, Ken.
He's here to tell us

382
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:44,612
- about the solar situation
- Ken?

383
00:17:44,715 --> 00:17:46,756
For the house...
so, uh...

384
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,750
Yeah, we offer financing.

385
00:17:54,444 --> 00:17:56,858
We just need one more minute,
and then we can go.

386
00:17:56,946 --> 00:17:59,362
- All right.
- Bye.

387
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:03,807
We never told them
about you.

388
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:05,698
Didn't wanna make them sad.

389
00:18:05,838 --> 00:18:08,400
- Yeah, I-I see.
- Yeah.

390
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:11,205
Well! This has been
really great.

391
00:18:11,293 --> 00:18:12,498
We have...

392
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:14,410
- We have a family dinner.
- We have a dinner.

393
00:18:14,497 --> 00:18:16,580
Every Thursday,
we have Italian food, so...

394
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:19,351
Although, tonight, we're switching it up.
We're gonna do Chinese.

395
00:18:19,518 --> 00:18:21,535
It was one of the hardest
decisions we ever had to make.

396
00:18:21,622 --> 00:18:23,039
Yeah.

397
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:28,284
Well, uh, Ken, we were
underwhelmed by your presentation.

398
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:42,487
- Hey, John.
- Yeah?

399
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:45,732
Did you move
the white pawn here?

400
00:18:46,716 --> 00:18:48,507
Opening move?

401
00:18:49,073 --> 00:18:50,406
No.

402
00:18:52,334 --> 00:18:53,917
Okay.

403
00:19:06,207 --> 00:19:08,079
I'm gonna go hit the head.

404
00:19:08,556 --> 00:19:11,424
I should be back
in about two minutes.

405
00:19:12,507 --> 00:19:14,008
Okay.

406
00:19:17,862 --> 00:19:19,557
Where's
the dunce cap?

407
00:19:39,085 --> 00:19:41,034
Hey, uh...

408
00:19:41,122 --> 00:19:42,869
Uh, Ethan?

409
00:19:43,135 --> 00:19:45,034
Yeah, Patches?

410
00:19:46,029 --> 00:19:47,734
I-I was actually
thinking that maybe

411
00:19:47,822 --> 00:19:50,281
we...
stop with the nickname.

412
00:19:50,369 --> 00:19:51,573
We had our fun,

413
00:19:51,676 --> 00:19:54,816
but maybe stop all the jokes
about my coding mistake

414
00:19:54,904 --> 00:19:57,358
from years ago,
and also...

415
00:19:57,445 --> 00:19:59,608
stop calling me Patches.

416
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,140
Yeah. Okay.

417
00:20:01,228 --> 00:20:02,349
Butt Stuff.

418
00:20:03,171 --> 00:20:04,149
You remember that?

419
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:06,150
When you walked around
all day and your T-shirt was

420
00:20:06,237 --> 00:20:08,318
stuck all the way
into your underwear, all day?

421
00:20:08,406 --> 00:20:11,570
I mean, I remember it,
but no to Butt Stuff.

422
00:20:11,703 --> 00:20:13,968
- Um, just call me Richard.
- Here's the thing.

423
00:20:14,161 --> 00:20:17,078
That name makes
me happy, and...

424
00:20:17,846 --> 00:20:21,146
if you had as much
managerial experience as I do,

425
00:20:21,234 --> 00:20:23,941
you'd know that keeping
your star coder happy

426
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:26,703
is how you get the best work,
and you guys need me

427
00:20:26,838 --> 00:20:29,365
to do really good work
because I'm kind of

428
00:20:29,453 --> 00:20:32,171
the only person here
that can do it, so...

429
00:20:32,259 --> 00:20:35,437
I'm just gonna keep
calling you Patches.

430
00:20:35,632 --> 00:20:38,257
Is that okay with you?
Patches?

431
00:20:38,782 --> 00:20:41,032
- Oh!
- Aw!

432
00:20:47,836 --> 00:20:49,857
So, it's complicated.

433
00:20:49,945 --> 00:20:52,269
You were the clear
aggressor in this incident,

434
00:20:52,357 --> 00:20:55,492
but you're also
the only one who got hurt.

435
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,812
You hit him
in the forehead,

436
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,304
which is the single hardest
part of the human body.

437
00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:02,567
I would never advocate violence,
but when you make a fist,

438
00:21:02,654 --> 00:21:05,398
you wanna keep your
thumb on the outside.

439
00:21:05,593 --> 00:21:08,935
Yeah. Uh, I know that now,
but at the time, I couldn't remember.

440
00:21:09,023 --> 00:21:11,630
You did great, Champ,
but here's the bottom line.

441
00:21:11,718 --> 00:21:14,748
We gotta cool our
shit down with this guy

442
00:21:14,836 --> 00:21:18,237
before he lawyers up
and sues us a new hiney-hole.

443
00:21:18,582 --> 00:21:20,823
You need to go talk to Ethan
and give him a sincere

444
00:21:20,911 --> 00:21:23,964
- and honest apology.
- Without admitting any fault

445
00:21:24,052 --> 00:21:26,294
or describing what
happened in any way.

446
00:21:29,659 --> 00:21:32,066
I asked myself,
why would they reject me

447
00:21:32,154 --> 00:21:34,411
and not their three other
biological children?

448
00:21:34,499 --> 00:21:36,443
And that is when it hit me.

449
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,451
It's me.

450
00:21:39,141 --> 00:21:41,128
I mean, even as a baby,
I must have

451
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,972
somehow rejected them,

452
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:46,263
and every subsequent
foster family I've ever had.

453
00:21:46,854 --> 00:21:48,568
Oh. Heavy.

454
00:21:48,667 --> 00:21:50,113
I rejected Richard,

455
00:21:50,201 --> 00:21:52,659
and every person who has
ever offered me safe harbor,

456
00:21:52,747 --> 00:21:53,817
and it has to stop.

457
00:21:53,904 --> 00:21:55,474
I have to commit to Gwart.

458
00:21:56,268 --> 00:21:58,190
No matter
how difficult it gets,

459
00:21:58,278 --> 00:22:00,441
even if we're miserable together,
I am going

460
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:03,441
to support her work,
and bring her food,

461
00:22:03,528 --> 00:22:05,831
and-and put her in her
prescription sleeping bag

462
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,349
when she starts to thrash.

463
00:22:07,732 --> 00:22:09,853
It is the only path forward.

464
00:22:10,153 --> 00:22:11,661
Hey, that's
the best, man.

465
00:22:11,749 --> 00:22:13,264
I feel like you made
a lot of progress.

466
00:22:13,351 --> 00:22:14,583
Ha!

467
00:22:16,042 --> 00:22:17,615
Gwart's doll gloves.

468
00:22:18,498 --> 00:22:20,404
I'm gonna make her so happy.

469
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:24,716
My book is
a fucking disaster.

470
00:22:27,278 --> 00:22:28,440
What have you got there?

471
00:22:28,528 --> 00:22:29,650
Oh, um,

472
00:22:29,737 --> 00:22:32,081
MSNBC wanted to interview you
about being

473
00:22:32,169 --> 00:22:35,458
an "anti-tech evangelist."
Their words.

474
00:22:35,695 --> 00:22:38,333
I told them you only wanted
to speak about two things:

475
00:22:38,421 --> 00:22:41,171
cold ice cream,
and hot kisses.

476
00:22:42,348 --> 00:22:45,107
Who-who was it?
Was it Hayes or O'Donnell?

477
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:46,573
Maddow, sir.

478
00:22:46,661 --> 00:22:48,378
- Really?
- Yes.

479
00:22:48,466 --> 00:22:51,068
I'm sure all the major outlets
would love to have you...

480
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:53,349
if you discuss tech.

481
00:22:55,218 --> 00:22:56,958
So...

482
00:22:59,693 --> 00:23:03,911
Do I honor my truth
as a starving author,

483
00:23:04,263 --> 00:23:07,136
or do I return to
the world I've scorned?

484
00:23:09,771 --> 00:23:12,270
What did Publisher's Weekly
say about my book?

485
00:23:13,674 --> 00:23:17,004
Publisher's Weekly is a...
terrible magazine, sir.

486
00:23:17,154 --> 00:23:18,358
Call Maddow.

487
00:23:18,445 --> 00:23:19,818
Yes, sir.

488
00:23:20,057 --> 00:23:23,021
Bishop to E6.

489
00:23:24,649 --> 00:23:27,240
- Checkmate.
- Fuck.

490
00:23:27,776 --> 00:23:29,779
Okay, so that's...

491
00:23:29,949 --> 00:23:33,536
42 games
for me, and...

492
00:23:33,864 --> 00:23:35,521
zero for you.

493
00:23:36,695 --> 00:23:38,191
You wanna play again?

494
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,372
I think I'll take a break.

495
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,209
Okay.

496
00:24:09,766 --> 00:24:11,052
Okay.

497
00:24:11,687 --> 00:24:14,175
Well, thank you so much

498
00:24:14,263 --> 00:24:17,794
for the hilarious Susan
Wojcicki, the CEO of YouTube.

499
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,607
It's gonna be a very
hard act to follow,

500
00:24:19,695 --> 00:24:21,525
but here to try is Monica Hall,

501
00:24:21,612 --> 00:24:24,271
the CFO of Pied Piper.
Come on up, Monica.

502
00:24:29,746 --> 00:24:31,700
- Thank you for coming, Monica.
- Thank you.

503
00:24:31,757 --> 00:24:34,536
I was thrilled
and surprised to be invited.

504
00:24:34,892 --> 00:24:36,971
So, let's cut
right to the chase.

505
00:24:37,065 --> 00:24:38,941
You recently acquired Hooli,

506
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:40,440
and one of
its properties

507
00:24:40,528 --> 00:24:42,608
is Foxhole, which
is apparently an app

508
00:24:42,695 --> 00:24:45,893
that military members use
to source prostitutes.

509
00:24:45,981 --> 00:24:47,732
Yes, and that's something

510
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,775
I'm not involved
with on any level.

511
00:24:49,862 --> 00:24:51,775
It's being run now
by a young woman

512
00:24:51,862 --> 00:24:53,581
I promoted,
Priyanka Singh.

513
00:24:53,669 --> 00:24:56,247
I talked to Priyanka
before this panel.

514
00:24:56,335 --> 00:24:57,748
Priyanka, are you
in this audience?

515
00:24:58,154 --> 00:25:00,576
- Yes, hi!
- Hey, Priyanka. How you doing?

516
00:25:00,664 --> 00:25:02,493
Why don't you get up
and tell us about it?

517
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,271
Well,

518
00:25:04,632 --> 00:25:07,524
when I first took over
the app, I was pretty lost,

519
00:25:07,612 --> 00:25:12,987
but, luckily, I was able to call on
my network of strong, female coders.

520
00:25:14,521 --> 00:25:16,927
And almost
immediately, we came up

521
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:20,480
with a plan to rebuild Foxhole
from the bottom up.

522
00:25:20,568 --> 00:25:24,150
Our first step will be to unionize
the sex workers on the app.

523
00:25:24,237 --> 00:25:27,191
We believe that friends
with benefits deserve benefits

524
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:29,771
because sex work is work.

525
00:25:30,891 --> 00:25:33,607
And! And!
Why is it only for men?

526
00:25:33,695 --> 00:25:37,245
Don't our female soldiers,
who put their bodies in harm's way,

527
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:40,990
deserve to put their
bodies in pleasure's way?

528
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:45,160
I think it might be a good
idea to bring Priyanka up here.

529
00:25:45,247 --> 00:25:48,154
- Priyanka, why don't you come up?
- Uh, okay.

530
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:56,141
So, Priyanka,

531
00:25:56,229 --> 00:25:58,308
the business
of sex positive feminism...

532
00:25:58,396 --> 00:25:59,560
Monica, move.

533
00:25:59,779 --> 00:26:02,984
Like we say at Foxhole,
if you can scale Tinder,

534
00:26:03,071 --> 00:26:05,067
you can scale
sex positive feminism.

535
00:26:05,154 --> 00:26:06,904
There's a seat in back.

536
00:26:10,838 --> 00:26:12,036
You.

537
00:26:13,537 --> 00:26:14,982
Who are you?

538
00:26:20,372 --> 00:26:23,118
Ethan. Hey, um...

539
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:25,309
I owe you an apology.

540
00:26:25,445 --> 00:26:27,984
It's bad enough
that I used brute force

541
00:26:28,071 --> 00:26:30,395
to search
a sorted list, but...

542
00:26:30,491 --> 00:26:33,057
No, Richard.
I'm the one

543
00:26:33,145 --> 00:26:35,786
that needs to apologize to you.
You're my boss,

544
00:26:35,887 --> 00:26:38,254
and the way that I talked to you
was completely outta line.

545
00:26:38,401 --> 00:26:41,122
I'm just feeling
insecure about

546
00:26:41,213 --> 00:26:43,963
working for a guy
that used to work for me.

547
00:26:45,281 --> 00:26:46,732
- Really?
- Yeah.

548
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:49,029
I'm so happy to be here, and...

549
00:26:49,943 --> 00:26:52,776
I'd love to stick around
if you'll have me.

550
00:26:53,203 --> 00:26:54,649
Yeah,
of course. Yeah.

551
00:26:54,737 --> 00:26:56,786
Great, man.
Thank you so much.

552
00:26:56,874 --> 00:26:58,872
Sorry again. Thank you,
this is great.

553
00:26:58,986 --> 00:27:00,275
Dinesh,
I'm really looking forward

554
00:27:00,362 --> 00:27:02,193
to finishing up this project
with you and your team.

555
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,473
- Oh, it's whatever, dawg.
- Cool.

556
00:27:06,317 --> 00:27:07,887
What did you
do to that guy?

557
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:11,108
- I watched that video.
- See? I told you! We're alphas!

558
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:12,551
- Fuck yeah!
- Fuck yeah.

559
00:27:12,639 --> 00:27:14,989
Hey, uh, don't show
that video to Gilfoyle.

560
00:27:15,193 --> 00:27:16,253
Got it.

561
00:27:17,942 --> 00:27:19,272
Fuck yeah.

562
00:27:37,468 --> 00:27:39,840
- I see it's been handled.
- Yes.

563
00:27:40,029 --> 00:27:41,179
Good.

564
00:27:41,667 --> 00:27:43,622
So, I trust there's
no more need for any...

565
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:46,122
No.
That won't be necessary.

566
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,007
Let's hope not.

567
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,921
Can I go now, please?

568
00:27:51,078 --> 00:27:53,984
Very well.
Good job on the plate.

569
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:58,914
Holden,

570
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:02,187
did you threaten
Ethan in some way?

571
00:28:03,176 --> 00:28:05,029
He was causing problems

572
00:28:05,117 --> 00:28:07,067
- for Richard.
- Oh.

573
00:28:07,257 --> 00:28:08,679
Well, it's...

574
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,054
it's good to know
that he's in good hands.

575
00:28:14,147 --> 00:28:15,677
Don't you have
somewhere to be?

576
00:28:15,765 --> 00:28:18,312
Uh... sorry. Um...

577
00:28:19,836 --> 00:28:21,502
It's from Gwart.

578
00:28:22,862 --> 00:28:26,445
"I'm dissolving my company
and taking a job elsewhere.

579
00:28:27,019 --> 00:28:29,414
"Your employment is terminated.

580
00:28:29,904 --> 00:28:33,023
P.S. Those aren't
my doll's gloves."

581
00:28:33,228 --> 00:28:34,353
Oh.

582
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:36,677
So, then I...

583
00:28:36,872 --> 00:28:39,497
I'm free to return
to work with Richard.

584
00:28:42,097 --> 00:28:44,421
Your position's
been filled.

585
00:28:47,365 --> 00:28:49,281
Oh, um...

586
00:28:51,251 --> 00:28:53,376
No, it hasn't.
