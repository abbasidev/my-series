Laurie is somehow fucking with

350
00:16:01,401 --> 00:16:02,752
our routing to slow
down the network.

351
00:16:02,776 --> 00:16:04,442
But why would they
bother attacking us?

352
00:16:04,526 --> 00:16:06,651
They have the AT&T deal
all locked up.

354
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:10,275
they don't.

355
00:16:10,693 --> 00:16:12,526
If she thinks their
Hawaii launch might fail,

356
00:16:12,609 --> 00:16:14,442
that would be a reason
to try to wipe us out

357
00:16:14,526 --> 00:16:16,109
while they have the chance.

358
00:16:16,192 --> 00:16:19,359

till YaoNet fucks up Hawaii,

359
00:16:19,442 --> 00:16:20,693

- JARED: All right.

362

bums off of the network.

Yeah. Well, uh,
that's impossible

365
00:16:32,526 --> 00:16:34,734
'cause the whole point
of a decentralized network

366
00:16:34,818 --> 00:16:38,567
is to prevent a single host
from controlling access.

367

So dictators can't ban
dissidents.

slower and still degrading.

able to weather the storm

563

deem our business a failure.

600
00:27:36,776 --> 00:27:39,025
All right, so, I was, uh,

601
00:27:39,109 --> 00:27:41,275
fiddling around
on Gilfoyle's laptop,

602
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,192
and I was looking down,

603
00:27:43,275 --> 00:27:45,901
and then I realized
that the solution was

604
00:27:45,984 --> 00:27:47,859
staring at me right in the face.

605
00:27:47,943 --> 00:27:49,025
Ants.

606
00:27:49,109 --> 00:27:50,359
It occurred to me

607
00:27:50,442 --> 00:27:53,484
that our network is kind
of like a series of paths,

608
00:27:53,567 --> 00:27:56,901
much like the trails ants use
in order to forage for food.

609
00:27:56,984 --> 00:28:01,651
But then, I thought
that we don't need better paths.

610
00:28:01,734 --> 00:28:04,651
We need better ants. You see?

611
00:28:04,734 --> 00:28:08,484

- What?

to create a new AI.

it is teaching itself

how to optimize.
