1
00:00:00,849 --> 00:00:01,766
Why isn't this book about tech?

2
00:00:02,057 --> 00:00:05,307
I didn't write about tech
because tech destroys worlds.

3
00:00:05,391 --> 00:00:07,474
And I, I wanted to create...

4
00:00:08,307 --> 00:00:10,265
May I have a token for
the restroom, please?

5
00:00:11,307 --> 00:00:12,641
So, you guys are planning to build

6
00:00:12,724 --> 00:00:14,974
your own external antennas to
deploy for the Hawaii test?

7
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:17,140
Why not just give away
Hooli phones for the test?

8
00:00:17,349 --> 00:00:19,224
I don't wanna use Hooli shit
any more than you guys,

9
00:00:19,307 --> 00:00:20,849
but this will get us to Hawaii.

10
00:00:21,265 --> 00:00:23,641
MSNBC wanted to interview you about being

11
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:25,683
an "anti-tech evangelist."

12
00:00:25,766 --> 00:00:27,766
What did Publishers
Weekly say about my book?

13
00:00:27,849 --> 00:00:29,265
Publishers Weekly is a...

14
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:31,140
terrible magazine, sir.

15
00:00:31,224 --> 00:00:32,265
Call Maddow.

16
00:00:32,349 --> 00:00:34,307
It's from Gwart.

17
00:00:34,641 --> 00:00:37,683
"I'm dissolving my company
and taking a job elsewhere."

18
00:00:37,766 --> 00:00:39,516
I'm free to return to work with Richard.

19
00:00:39,724 --> 00:00:41,599
Your position's been filled.

20
00:00:42,432 --> 00:00:43,891
No, it hasn't.

21
00:01:38,683 --> 00:01:39,891
Fuck yeah, right?

22
00:01:40,015 --> 00:01:41,933
You see the chick in the racism car?

23
00:01:42,015 --> 00:01:43,891
I banged her in the famine truck.

24
00:01:43,974 --> 00:01:45,516
I-I'm sorry. What is this?

25
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:48,432
It's the trailer for my festival, RussFest.

26
00:01:48,516 --> 00:01:51,432
Three days of partying, sucking,
and fucking on a plot of land

27
00:01:51,516 --> 00:01:53,432
so far out even Nevada barely wants it.

28
00:01:53,516 --> 00:01:56,599
I'll be serving Tres Commas exclusively.

29
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:57,766
It's gonna be like Burning Man,

30
00:01:57,849 --> 00:01:59,474
except I'll make a fuckton of money.

31
00:01:59,557 --> 00:02:00,683
So, Earning Man?

32
00:02:02,432 --> 00:02:05,599
I literally love you, you spooky fuck.
So, we in?

33
00:02:05,683 --> 00:02:07,099
- In what?
- RussFest.

34
00:02:07,182 --> 00:02:08,933
There's no internet in the
middle of the desert, Richard.

35
00:02:09,015 --> 00:02:10,349
Maybe that's why no one lives out there.

36
00:02:10,432 --> 00:02:11,766
I don't know, I'm not an archaeologist.

37
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:13,391
All I know is they're
telling me it's gonna cost

38
00:02:13,474 --> 00:02:15,391
a fucking fortune to get the
infrastructure out there.

39
00:02:15,474 --> 00:02:17,265
Unless you guys do it for free.

40
00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:19,391
- Why would we do it for free?
- Because it's cool.

41
00:02:19,474 --> 00:02:21,349
- It's good for your brand.
- Well, Russ,

42
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:23,849
we appreciate the interest...

43
00:02:23,933 --> 00:02:25,140
I like where this is going.

44
00:02:25,224 --> 00:02:26,683
- But...
- Fuck!

45
00:02:26,766 --> 00:02:29,808
Uh, right now, we are trying to launch

46
00:02:29,891 --> 00:02:32,099
a huge pilot program in Hawaii.

47
00:02:32,182 --> 00:02:33,641
Dinesh is actually heading out there

48
00:02:33,724 --> 00:02:36,224
first thing tomorrow morning,
and I am about to sit down

49
00:02:36,307 --> 00:02:38,557
with the network operations
president of AT&T,

50
00:02:38,641 --> 00:02:41,516
trying to close this massive deal,

51
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,974
but that all depends on
getting Hawaii right.

52
00:02:45,057 --> 00:02:46,307
There's just no way we could do both.

53
00:02:46,391 --> 00:02:48,516
And you would rather do
Hawaii than RussFest?

54
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:50,140
I would rather

55
00:02:50,224 --> 00:02:53,766
do my own mother than RussFest.

56
00:02:55,307 --> 00:02:57,140
How come whenever you
guys wanna do some shit,

57
00:02:57,224 --> 00:02:58,307
I'm always like, "fuck yeah!"

58
00:02:58,391 --> 00:02:59,766
But whenever I wanna do some cool shit,

59
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:02,474
you guys piss all over it! You know what?
Gimme this.

60
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:06,099
Have fun shoving pineapples
up each other's dick holes!

61
00:03:06,182 --> 00:03:08,307
And pussy holes.

62
00:03:08,808 --> 00:03:10,307
You creepy fuck.

63
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:22,557
What have I been telling you, Lawrence?

64
00:03:22,641 --> 00:03:24,808
Impressive. Very impressive.

65
00:03:25,933 --> 00:03:28,015
- Looking forward to talking a lot more.
- Yeah.

66
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:29,766
Yeah, definitely.

67
00:03:32,474 --> 00:03:34,474
- Richard!
- Whoo!

68
00:03:35,557 --> 00:03:37,349
- Sorry. Um, how did it go?
- Cool.

69
00:03:37,432 --> 00:03:40,224
Well, I wanna keep it on
the down-low, but, uh...

70
00:03:40,933 --> 00:03:42,432
Fuck.

71
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:47,099
Is that joy?

72
00:03:47,182 --> 00:03:49,057
It could not have gone better.

73
00:03:49,808 --> 00:03:52,182
When they found out how
much money they could save

74
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:54,891
by using us to help
simplify their 5G rollout,

75
00:03:54,974 --> 00:03:57,307
they practically shit themselves.

76
00:03:57,391 --> 00:04:00,557
This could be bigger than we thought.

77
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:03,933
Monica, we could be on 100 million phones.

78
00:04:04,015 --> 00:04:05,808
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

79
00:04:05,891 --> 00:04:08,516
- Okay. Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
- Yeah.

80
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:10,933
- You know, focus on Hawaii, make
sure we land the plane. - Yeah.

81
00:04:11,015 --> 00:04:13,057
It's weird. I actually
don't know what to do

82
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,140
when things are going well.
It is not natural.

83
00:04:19,724 --> 00:04:21,391
- Yeah.
- Okay.

84
00:04:21,474 --> 00:04:22,724
Ha, ha, ha!

85
00:04:22,808 --> 00:04:24,057
What's the newest killer app

86
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,724
coming out of Silicon Valley?

87
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:28,182
Would you believe ethics?

88
00:04:28,265 --> 00:04:30,140
It's all thanks to our first guest,

89
00:04:30,224 --> 00:04:32,265
a former big-tech CEO

90
00:04:32,349 --> 00:04:34,265
turned responsible tech evangelist...

91
00:04:34,349 --> 00:04:36,140
You know what? Not even this turd

92
00:04:36,224 --> 00:04:37,974
is gonna bring me down right now.

93
00:04:38,057 --> 00:04:40,891
- caution and accountability.
- Thanks for being here.

94
00:04:40,974 --> 00:04:43,182
Well, I always find time for you, Gabby.

95
00:04:43,265 --> 00:04:45,265
Please. No one is buying
your bullshit, Gavin.

96
00:04:45,349 --> 00:04:47,224
My message invigorates me.

97
00:04:47,307 --> 00:04:49,974
For too long, these large tech companies

98
00:04:50,057 --> 00:04:53,140
have harvested our data, they
have violated our privacy,

99
00:04:53,224 --> 00:04:54,724
they have tracked our every move.

100
00:04:54,808 --> 00:04:58,391
They is you, you hypocrite. You did that.
He did that!

101
00:04:58,474 --> 00:05:00,599
Starting today, I will be asking

102
00:05:00,683 --> 00:05:02,307
prominent members of the tech community

103
00:05:02,391 --> 00:05:04,641
to sign their name onto this.

104
00:05:04,724 --> 00:05:07,140
A code of conduct, authored by me,

105
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:09,808
that pledges them to a universal ethos,

106
00:05:09,891 --> 00:05:12,808
which I created, that I
call, "tech ethics,"

107
00:05:12,891 --> 00:05:14,641
or, "tethics" for short.

108
00:05:14,724 --> 00:05:16,808
- Oof.
- Tethics. Clever.

109
00:05:16,891 --> 00:05:18,182
No. No, it isn't.

110
00:05:18,265 --> 00:05:20,140
Fuck that guy. Honestly, fuck that guy.

111
00:05:20,224 --> 00:05:21,224
Richard, I have your tea.

112
00:05:21,307 --> 00:05:22,849
No one in town is ever gonna sign

113
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:24,182
this hypocrite's

114
00:05:24,265 --> 00:05:26,683
- hypocritical garbage.
- Well, I'm sold.

115
00:05:26,766 --> 00:05:29,974
Can I sign? Well, you
have to lead a corporation.

116
00:05:30,057 --> 00:05:32,808
Okay. And how about you at home?

117
00:05:32,891 --> 00:05:35,641
Are you tethical? Tweet us @GoodDayTheBay

118
00:05:35,724 --> 00:05:37,307
and let us know where you stand.

119
00:05:37,391 --> 00:05:40,349
Sure, yes, I will. Get
ready for some opinions.

120
00:05:41,516 --> 00:05:42,724
Holden?

121
00:05:43,057 --> 00:05:45,766
Why is the television on the news?

122
00:05:45,849 --> 00:05:49,140
Jared, I don't need you
telling me my job, okay?

123
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:50,683
Holden, um,

124
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:53,557
I know things have been a bit
antagonistic between us.

125
00:05:53,641 --> 00:05:56,224
We've been like, uh, Tonya
Harding and Nancy Kerrigan.

126
00:05:56,307 --> 00:05:59,683
But, I've been thinking about
it, and you work for Richard,

127
00:05:59,766 --> 00:06:02,265
and I want what's best for him

128
00:06:02,349 --> 00:06:05,099
'cause I want him to be
happy, so from now on...

129
00:06:05,974 --> 00:06:07,599
you're my friend.

130
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,683
You're my best friend.

131
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,849
Even if you make the occasional oopsie.

132
00:06:11,933 --> 00:06:13,140
Are you fucking with me?

133
00:06:13,224 --> 00:06:15,015
Why would I do that to my best friend?

134
00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:16,933
- Love you like a brother.
- Uh...

135
00:06:18,808 --> 00:06:20,140
Absolutely not.

136
00:06:20,224 --> 00:06:22,265
We haven't told you what we want yet.

137
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:24,015
- Irrelevant.
- Sit down.

138
00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:26,099
- Thank you.
- I'd like to talk to you

139
00:06:26,182 --> 00:06:27,724
about your Piper-Pulse numbers.

140
00:06:27,808 --> 00:06:29,057
I'd like that, Tracy,

141
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,140
because I have no idea
what the fuck that is.

142
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,683
Of course you do. It's the
system that Tracy created

143
00:06:33,766 --> 00:06:36,683
for employees to give feedback
on senior management.

144
00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:38,683
The point is, I happen to know

145
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:40,683
a lot of folks over at AT&T,

146
00:06:40,766 --> 00:06:42,724
and I think it might help us

147
00:06:42,808 --> 00:06:45,766
if I back-channel some of the
information I've gathered.

148
00:06:45,849 --> 00:06:48,391
But before I do, I'd like to
tell you how you're doing.

149
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:49,933
I know how I'm doing.

150
00:06:50,015 --> 00:06:51,641
I'm fucking killing it.

151
00:06:51,724 --> 00:06:53,224
I'm building great shit out there.

152
00:06:53,307 --> 00:06:57,307
Yes. Your acumen scores are excellent.

153
00:06:57,391 --> 00:06:59,891
On a scale of one to 10, you're at a 9.9.

154
00:06:59,974 --> 00:07:02,432
So, all 10's and...

155
00:07:02,516 --> 00:07:04,015
- Dinesh.
- But, it's your

156
00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:07,057
interpersonal rating I'd
like to drill down on.

157
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,557
It's at 1.5.

158
00:07:08,641 --> 00:07:11,140
Your coworkers find you unapproachable,

159
00:07:11,224 --> 00:07:12,516
rude,

160
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:15,182
and capable of great hurt

161
00:07:15,265 --> 00:07:17,140
with an unsettling stare.

162
00:07:18,474 --> 00:07:19,933
Okay.

163
00:07:20,015 --> 00:07:22,432
We want AT&T to see a thriving company.

164
00:07:22,516 --> 00:07:24,599
If you really make a concerted effort

165
00:07:24,683 --> 00:07:26,599
at outreach and team building,

166
00:07:26,683 --> 00:07:28,849
you could get your numbers up. Tracy.

167
00:07:28,933 --> 00:07:31,933
I appreciate you wanting to participate

168
00:07:32,015 --> 00:07:33,265
in the world of numbers.

169
00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:35,432
I find it endearing.

170
00:07:35,516 --> 00:07:36,766
But yours are horseshit.

171
00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:39,099
They measure nothing. If I wanted to,

172
00:07:39,182 --> 00:07:41,474
I could have all 10's
by the end of the week.

173
00:07:41,766 --> 00:07:43,891
Gilfoyle, metrics like Piper-Pulse

174
00:07:43,974 --> 00:07:45,307
are a widely accepted measure

175
00:07:45,391 --> 00:07:46,766
of how your peers feel about you.

176
00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:50,015
Speaking of, Monica, your
interpersonal is at a 2.

177
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:51,474
- What?
- Huh.

178
00:07:51,557 --> 00:07:54,307
No, that's just because
Priyanka and her little...

179
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:57,307
witch's nest over at Foxhole
are bringing my numbers down.

180
00:07:57,391 --> 00:07:59,099
No. Most of your lower scores

181
00:07:59,182 --> 00:08:02,349
are coming from engineers,
who are 84% male.

182
00:08:02,557 --> 00:08:04,808
Maybe you should try some of that outreach.

183
00:08:04,891 --> 00:08:08,140
Whatever I do, I'm sure I
could do it better than you.

184
00:08:08,224 --> 00:08:09,933
Two days.

185
00:08:10,015 --> 00:08:11,683
All 10's.

186
00:08:12,474 --> 00:08:13,599
Deal.

187
00:08:13,683 --> 00:08:16,391
Aloha. Aloha to you.

188
00:08:17,057 --> 00:08:19,224
Aloha. Alo...

189
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:22,391
- Oh, hey, Dinesh.
- What the fuck.

190
00:08:22,641 --> 00:08:23,766
I like your beard.

191
00:08:23,849 --> 00:08:25,683
Um, why are you here? Where's AJ?

192
00:08:25,766 --> 00:08:27,683
Oh, AJ can't come. You wanted him

193
00:08:27,766 --> 00:08:29,974
to become a certified scuba
before the trip, right?

194
00:08:30,057 --> 00:08:31,599
Yeah, so we could...

195
00:08:31,683 --> 00:08:33,140
fucking scuba, Gabe.

196
00:08:33,224 --> 00:08:34,974
Well, he finished all his
check dives last night,

197
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:37,307
but you have to wait 24
hours before you fly,

198
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:39,683
so we decided to trade places.

199
00:08:39,766 --> 00:08:41,432
- For the day?
- Uh, no.

200
00:08:41,516 --> 00:08:43,265
F-for-for all of it.

201
00:08:44,599 --> 00:08:46,265
- Why?
- Because it...

202
00:08:46,349 --> 00:08:48,516
- it-it'd be easier?
- No.

203
00:08:48,599 --> 00:08:50,683
And what are you doing in first class?

204
00:08:50,766 --> 00:08:53,182
So, the pilot is from Pakistan.

205
00:08:53,265 --> 00:08:56,349
I said, "Hey, I know a guy from Pakistan.
I work with him."

206
00:08:56,432 --> 00:08:57,766
And then he said, "Hey, why don't you

207
00:08:57,849 --> 00:09:01,391
come to the front and
sit in the big chairs."

208
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:03,641
B-but that's me. I'm the guy from Pakistan.

209
00:09:03,724 --> 00:09:06,391
I told him that, and then
he... and then he put me here.

210
00:09:06,474 --> 00:09:09,140
Okay, but I, the guy from Pakistan...

211
00:09:09,224 --> 00:09:11,182
- Right.
- am back in economy.

212
00:09:11,265 --> 00:09:13,933
Sir? You're gonna need to take your seat.

213
00:09:14,015 --> 00:09:15,808
And Captain Bashir wanted you to have

214
00:09:15,891 --> 00:09:17,265
these samosas his mother made.

215
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:19,140
Oh. No, thank you.

216
00:09:26,557 --> 00:09:28,724
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

217
00:09:28,808 --> 00:09:30,766
Hey, Danny? Excuse me?

218
00:09:31,474 --> 00:09:33,015
- What are you wearing?
- A shirt.

219
00:09:34,766 --> 00:09:37,808
- Oh my God. - I think a lot of
what Gavin is saying makes sense.

220
00:09:37,891 --> 00:09:40,391
Yeah, of course it does. I've
been saying it for years.

221
00:09:40,474 --> 00:09:43,391
- So, you agree with him?
- Well, no. He is full of shit.

222
00:09:43,474 --> 00:09:46,724
But, you aren't, even though
you're saying the same things?

223
00:09:46,808 --> 00:09:48,849
Yeah, because I mean it!
And I said it first!

224
00:09:48,933 --> 00:09:50,391
That feels petty and personal,

225
00:09:50,474 --> 00:09:52,808
which is against Gavin's code of tethics.

226
00:09:52,891 --> 00:09:54,391
- What does that even mean?
- Hey, Richard,

227
00:09:54,474 --> 00:09:56,724
- are you signing Gavin's pledge?
- Ah, what?

228
00:09:56,808 --> 00:09:58,391
Because I'm getting a lot
of heat from my friends

229
00:09:58,474 --> 00:10:00,933
over at Facebook for working
at an untethical company.

230
00:10:01,015 --> 00:10:04,057
Okay, cool. So, Facebook
is calling us untethical.

231
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,557
Yeah, because they signed the pledge.

232
00:10:05,641 --> 00:10:07,265
So did Google and Amazon and Twitter.

233
00:10:07,349 --> 00:10:08,766
- Don't care.
- Speaking of,

234
00:10:08,849 --> 00:10:09,974
even if you don't sign,

235
00:10:10,057 --> 00:10:11,766
could you at least stop tweeting about it?

236
00:10:11,849 --> 00:10:15,432
"Anyone who signs this Tethics
thing is a thumbass"?

237
00:10:15,516 --> 00:10:17,891
- That doesn't even make sense.
- Yes, it does.

238
00:10:17,974 --> 00:10:19,599
It's dumbass but with thumb.

239
00:10:19,683 --> 00:10:22,224
Thumbass. It's basically perfect.

240
00:10:22,307 --> 00:10:25,140
Tethics is tech ethics.
What's the thumb part?

241
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:27,599
And why are you tweeting that
from your personal account?

242
00:10:27,683 --> 00:10:29,808
The Verge referred to you
as "notable tethics holdout

243
00:10:29,891 --> 00:10:32,265
and amateur insult comedian
Richard Hendricks."

244
00:10:32,349 --> 00:10:34,599
Andy Borowitz wrote a
pointed piece about you

245
00:10:34,683 --> 00:10:38,057
- called "Doubting Richard." - Ah, see?
That doesn't really make any sense.

246
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,015
I mean, what's the pun? What am I
supposed to be enjoying there?

247
00:10:40,099 --> 00:10:41,724
- Now, you're harshing on Borowitz?
- Well yeah,

248
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,391
if he's coming up with those zingers.

249
00:10:43,474 --> 00:10:45,182
If you like Andy Borowitz so
much, why don't you marry him?

250
00:10:45,265 --> 00:10:47,599
Says the guy who's three months
behind in child support.

251
00:10:47,683 --> 00:10:48,974
A dog is not a child!

252
00:10:49,057 --> 00:10:50,349
- Uh...
- Michael Eisenberg

253
00:10:50,432 --> 00:10:51,516
from AT&T is on the phone.

254
00:10:51,599 --> 00:10:53,891
- He says it's urgent.
- Ah, great.

255
00:10:54,557 --> 00:10:56,015
Hey, Michael, what's up?

256
00:10:56,099 --> 00:10:59,766
- Did you just publicly insult my boss?
- What? No.

257
00:10:59,849 --> 00:11:01,641
"Anyone who signs this Tethics
thing is a thumbass."

258
00:11:01,724 --> 00:11:04,182
Well, my boss just signed
Gavin Belson's pledge.

259
00:11:04,265 --> 00:11:05,474
- He did? Why?
- Because

260
00:11:05,557 --> 00:11:07,391
loudmouths like you got
up in front of Congress

261
00:11:07,474 --> 00:11:09,766
and whined about how somebody needed
to do something about big tech.

262
00:11:09,849 --> 00:11:11,474
Okay, I did that one time...

263
00:11:11,557 --> 00:11:12,974
And now, Gavin has managed

264
00:11:13,057 --> 00:11:14,432
to paint himself as that guy.

265
00:11:14,516 --> 00:11:17,015
And we all have to fall in
line, or we'll be in PR hell.

266
00:11:17,099 --> 00:11:19,808
Or worse! We'll face government regulation.

267
00:11:19,891 --> 00:11:22,057
Look, have you read his pledge?

268
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,516
No, of course not. It's trash.

269
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:26,015
The first line says, "We, the undersigned,

270
00:11:26,099 --> 00:11:29,099
promise to make best efforts
to," blah, blah, blah.

271
00:11:29,182 --> 00:11:31,474
Best efforts, Richard.
It's totally toothless.

272
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:33,516
Yes. Exactly, Michael.
That's entirely my point.

273
00:11:33,599 --> 00:11:35,849
It's all empty bullshit. It means nothing.

274
00:11:35,933 --> 00:11:37,683
Then who the fuck cares, Richard?

275
00:11:37,766 --> 00:11:40,516
Do not fuck this all up over
a pointless moral stand!

276
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:42,015
Okay. Sign the fucking pledge!

277
00:11:42,099 --> 00:11:44,182
Oh, and stop tweeting about
thumbs up people's asses.

278
00:11:44,265 --> 00:11:46,599
Oh. No, th-that's wordplay.

279
00:11:46,683 --> 00:11:47,849
Michael?

280
00:11:50,683 --> 00:11:53,349
That is one lucky mug, Holden, my friend.

281
00:11:53,432 --> 00:11:55,224
- Please stop.
- Stop what?

282
00:11:55,307 --> 00:11:58,015
- You're just trying to creep me
out so that I'll quit. - What?

283
00:11:58,099 --> 00:12:01,099
I mean, why wouldn't
somebody be nice to you?

284
00:12:02,099 --> 00:12:03,849
Are you a piece of shit?

285
00:12:09,057 --> 00:12:11,766
- Oh hey, Dinesh.
- Okay, listen, Gabe.

286
00:12:11,849 --> 00:12:13,683
I spent the entire flight streamlining

287
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:16,099
our setup procedure, so I am gonna take

288
00:12:16,182 --> 00:12:18,182
the rental convertible and
drive tower to tower,

289
00:12:18,265 --> 00:12:22,182
most of which are on pristine
beaches or scenic volcanoes

290
00:12:22,265 --> 00:12:26,140
to check coverage while you sit
at the office by yourself.

291
00:12:26,224 --> 00:12:28,224
- Welcome...
- Oh! No! No! I get it.

292
00:12:28,307 --> 00:12:31,307
- Put it on me. I-I don't want the plastic
one. - Are you one of the first cla...

293
00:12:31,391 --> 00:12:33,641
Put it on me. Put it on me. Put it...

294
00:12:33,974 --> 00:12:34,766
Aloha.

295
00:12:37,099 --> 00:12:39,808
Richard. To what do I owe the pleasure?

296
00:12:39,891 --> 00:12:42,599
Just calling to, you know.

297
00:12:42,683 --> 00:12:44,432
To what, Richard?

298
00:12:44,516 --> 00:12:47,641
Sign your thing. My thing?
To sign my thing?

299
00:12:47,724 --> 00:12:51,766
I sense a certain lack
of commitment, Richard.

300
00:12:51,849 --> 00:12:53,683
I mean, if I suspected the only reason

301
00:12:53,766 --> 00:12:55,432
you wanted to lend your name to my cause

302
00:12:55,516 --> 00:12:58,599
was because of the enormous
pressure you're probably facing

303
00:12:58,683 --> 00:13:00,891
as a notable holdout, well,

304
00:13:00,974 --> 00:13:02,432
how could I allow you

305
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:05,057
to add your name to my tethics pledge?

306
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,307
That would be... untethical.

307
00:13:07,391 --> 00:13:10,599
Gavin, come on. Just... can
we get this over with?

308
00:13:10,683 --> 00:13:11,766
Then again, the idea of you

309
00:13:11,849 --> 00:13:13,140
publicly committing to the cause,

310
00:13:13,224 --> 00:13:15,432
that gives me joy.

311
00:13:15,516 --> 00:13:19,182
So yes, Richard, I'd be happy
to be your moral mentor.

312
00:13:19,516 --> 00:13:21,474
I guess I'll see you at the ceremony.

313
00:13:21,557 --> 00:13:23,599
- What ceremony?
- The groundbreaking

314
00:13:23,683 --> 00:13:26,641
- for the Institute.
- What fucking institute?

315
00:13:26,724 --> 00:13:30,015
The Belson Institute of Tethics.
It's all on our website.

316
00:13:30,099 --> 00:13:32,182
You and the others will all be there

317
00:13:32,265 --> 00:13:34,432
to publicly commit to the pledge.

318
00:13:34,516 --> 00:13:36,849
Also, I'm gonna be asking
you to say a few words.

319
00:13:36,933 --> 00:13:39,974
Just a bit about how much of a fan you are,

320
00:13:40,057 --> 00:13:43,516
dedicated to the cause, my
cause, maybe lead with a joke.

321
00:13:43,599 --> 00:13:45,474
Be good to have you there, Richard.

322
00:13:45,849 --> 00:13:48,599
Securing my legacy with you at my wing.

323
00:13:49,516 --> 00:13:51,724
Wear pants you can kneel in.

324
00:13:53,683 --> 00:13:54,724
Hey, Nathan!

325
00:13:54,808 --> 00:13:58,391
I was, uh, perusing your
file, and I just...

326
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:02,557
Hey.

327
00:14:03,683 --> 00:14:05,516
- What?
- Sorry. I just, um,

328
00:14:05,599 --> 00:14:07,557
I was quickly perusing your file...

329
00:14:07,641 --> 00:14:09,224
That's not what peruse means.

330
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:12,766
Peruse means to read
thoroughly and carefully.

331
00:14:13,265 --> 00:14:16,683
Wow. That... that's... super helpful.

332
00:14:16,766 --> 00:14:19,599
Thank you for that tip.

333
00:14:19,683 --> 00:14:21,683
Um, anyway, yeah,

334
00:14:21,766 --> 00:14:24,933
I was just curious to know,
like, what's it like...

335
00:14:25,015 --> 00:14:26,432
growing up in Rhode Island?

336
00:14:26,974 --> 00:14:30,182
Well, maybe some time when
you're working on something,

337
00:14:30,265 --> 00:14:32,516
I can come interrupt your flow

338
00:14:32,599 --> 00:14:36,474
and use words incorrectly
to tell you about it.

339
00:14:39,557 --> 00:14:41,140
Got it.

340
00:14:42,933 --> 00:14:45,099
Oh, you own a Prius?

341
00:14:45,182 --> 00:14:48,099
Popular choice. Later, Daniel.

342
00:14:48,557 --> 00:14:49,766
What?

343
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,808
Well, you win.

344
00:14:53,891 --> 00:14:57,349
That is the worst case
of contact dermatitis

345
00:14:57,432 --> 00:14:58,599
I have ever seen.

346
00:14:58,683 --> 00:15:00,808
- The itching is so insane!
- Right.

347
00:15:00,891 --> 00:15:02,391
- It's like from the inside!
- Warren!

348
00:15:02,474 --> 00:15:04,224
Come here, I want you to see something.
This is Warren,

349
00:15:04,307 --> 00:15:06,891
our resident. This is his first week.

350
00:15:06,974 --> 00:15:08,557
Warren, I want you to notice

351
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:10,391
the violent allergic reaction

352
00:15:10,474 --> 00:15:13,933
to the plumeria flowers
used in the patient's lei,

353
00:15:14,015 --> 00:15:15,140
which is weird.

354
00:15:15,224 --> 00:15:17,015
Normally, they just hand out plastic ones.

355
00:15:17,099 --> 00:15:18,140
Just make it stop!

356
00:15:18,224 --> 00:15:19,891
Well, the good news is a strong

357
00:15:19,974 --> 00:15:22,891
anti-histamine shot oughta
take care of it in no time.

358
00:15:22,974 --> 00:15:26,474
Oh! Great! Yeah! The shot!
Just-just gimme the shot!

359
00:15:26,557 --> 00:15:29,516
Now, before we proceed, I
should warn you the shot,

360
00:15:29,599 --> 00:15:31,057
it works like gangbusters,

361
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,766
but it does tend to cause

362
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:35,224
acute sensitivity to sunlight,

363
00:15:35,307 --> 00:15:36,974
so you're gonna wanna stay indoors

364
00:15:37,057 --> 00:15:39,808
- for four to six weeks.
- What?!

365
00:15:39,891 --> 00:15:41,516
Warren, no!

366
00:15:42,933 --> 00:15:46,057
We wait until after I've explained

367
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,683
all the possible complications,

368
00:15:48,766 --> 00:15:50,557
and only then,

369
00:15:50,641 --> 00:15:52,516
do we administer the injection.

370
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:54,724
- Did you say four to six weeks?
- Yep.

371
00:15:54,808 --> 00:15:58,182
Otherwise, you're gonna be back
here for something a lot worse.

372
00:15:59,015 --> 00:16:00,683
All right, well...

373
00:16:01,307 --> 00:16:03,599
that was a teachable moment, huh?

374
00:16:03,683 --> 00:16:04,933
- Yeah. Sure.
- Yeah.

375
00:16:08,849 --> 00:16:11,599
I got next. And, uh, better watch out

376
00:16:11,683 --> 00:16:14,099
'cause I am the queen of Asteroids.

377
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:16,974
- Are you trying to cut in line?
- You don't need a quarter.

378
00:16:17,057 --> 00:16:18,766
It's on free play, duh.

379
00:16:18,849 --> 00:16:21,557
We get it. You make more money than us.

380
00:16:23,057 --> 00:16:24,724
Okay, you know what?

381
00:16:28,224 --> 00:16:30,015
- Gilfoyle, you're awesome.
- Carl.

382
00:16:30,891 --> 00:16:32,349
You're doin' it.

383
00:16:35,224 --> 00:16:36,641
What the fuck?

384
00:16:36,724 --> 00:16:38,683
My man.

385
00:16:39,974 --> 00:16:41,641
"Integrity. We do the right thing.

386
00:16:41,724 --> 00:16:44,599
- We are committed to the highest
ethical standards." - It's all such

387
00:16:44,683 --> 00:16:48,182
banal, self-righteous, hacky bullshit.

388
00:16:48,265 --> 00:16:49,683
- And I have to endorse it?
- Yeah.

389
00:16:49,766 --> 00:16:53,307
It is particularly pedestrian
pablum, even for Gavin.

390
00:16:53,391 --> 00:16:55,015
"Responsibility. We contribute

391
00:16:55,099 --> 00:16:57,015
to the growth, joy, and enrichment

392
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,057
of all the lives we touch.

393
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,974
- Courage..."
- Wait, uh,

394
00:17:01,057 --> 00:17:02,724
- what was that last one?
- Responsibility?

395
00:17:02,808 --> 00:17:04,683
Uh, "We contribute to the growth,

396
00:17:04,766 --> 00:17:07,265
joy, and enrichment of
all the lives we touch."

397
00:17:08,974 --> 00:17:10,099
Holden!

398
00:17:10,724 --> 00:17:13,224
Can you bring the menu
book in here, please?

399
00:17:13,557 --> 00:17:14,766
Hi, guy!

400
00:17:15,808 --> 00:17:17,516
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

401
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,391
Yes. You are a good boy.

402
00:17:21,683 --> 00:17:23,265
Are you hungry?

403
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:26,099
I am. Holden.

404
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:28,265
Holden.

405
00:17:28,557 --> 00:17:29,557
Holden.

406
00:17:30,432 --> 00:17:31,724
Holden...

407
00:17:31,808 --> 00:17:33,724
Ah, good. Applebee's. We were...

408
00:17:33,808 --> 00:17:35,224
ordering from here the other night,

409
00:17:35,307 --> 00:17:38,516
and we were all joking about
this, uh... Yes, look.

410
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,474
Uh, so, their mission statement

411
00:17:40,557 --> 00:17:43,432
is right near their nachos,
and we were saying

412
00:17:43,516 --> 00:17:45,891
that this is not-cho mission statement.

413
00:17:45,974 --> 00:17:48,391
Wait, I'm sorry.

414
00:17:48,474 --> 00:17:50,015
Was that a joke?

415
00:17:50,683 --> 00:17:52,557
That. It's... it's a pun.

416
00:17:52,641 --> 00:17:54,849
- Right.
- It's just like thumbass, you know.

417
00:17:54,933 --> 00:17:56,349
It's in the same genre.

418
00:17:56,683 --> 00:17:59,766
- Like what?
- Thumbass? I've been saying it a lot.

419
00:18:01,349 --> 00:18:03,140
Read it, read it.

420
00:18:03,974 --> 00:18:05,516
"At Applebee's, our
mission is to contribute

421
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:07,057
to the growth, joy...

422
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,683
and enrichment of all the
lives we touch." Wait...

423
00:18:10,766 --> 00:18:13,724
That's word for word
what's in Gavin's pledge.

424
00:18:13,808 --> 00:18:15,057
Yes, it is.

425
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,057
- You don't think...
- That's exactly what I think.

426
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,641
Read me another one of
Gavin's frilly sentences.

427
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:23,849
"Maintaining our uncompromising
principles while we grow."

428
00:18:25,683 --> 00:18:28,057
That's Starbucks.

429
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,557
Okay, again.

430
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:32,891
"Enhance the quality of life for all ages."

431
00:18:33,849 --> 00:18:35,599
- That's the AARP.
- Yes!

432
00:18:35,683 --> 00:18:38,099
My best friend Gloria was a
charter member for 35 years

433
00:18:38,182 --> 00:18:40,265
- before she passed.
- The question is...

434
00:18:40,849 --> 00:18:42,933
if Gavin stole his entire code of conduct

435
00:18:43,015 --> 00:18:45,933
for this stupid fucking foundation,

436
00:18:46,015 --> 00:18:48,641
what else has he been stealing?

437
00:18:49,933 --> 00:18:51,432
All right, I give up.

438
00:18:51,516 --> 00:18:54,307
Even this stupid hair didn't work.

439
00:18:54,391 --> 00:18:56,891
How are you getting these
people to like you?

440
00:18:56,974 --> 00:18:59,432
I'm not getting anyone to like me.

441
00:18:59,516 --> 00:19:00,808
Bullshit. I've seen you out there.

442
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:04,307
It's like you have a non-evil twin.
It's very weird.

443
00:19:04,391 --> 00:19:06,140
Monica...

444
00:19:06,224 --> 00:19:09,432
gaining someone's confidence is easy.

445
00:19:09,516 --> 00:19:11,974
Appear open and interested

446
00:19:12,057 --> 00:19:13,683
by mimicking their body language

447
00:19:13,766 --> 00:19:16,015
and repeating what they say back to them.

448
00:19:16,099 --> 00:19:18,808
So, you just repeat what they say?

449
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:21,057
I just repeat what they say.

450
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,182
I was social engineering them.

451
00:19:24,057 --> 00:19:26,140
Once trust is established,

452
00:19:26,224 --> 00:19:29,057
the social engineer simply
offers up information,

453
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:32,641
and the subject Pets names,

454
00:19:32,724 --> 00:19:34,683
kids names, birthdays.

455
00:19:34,766 --> 00:19:36,808
Then, that information is entered

456
00:19:36,891 --> 00:19:38,933
into a word list generator.

457
00:19:39,015 --> 00:19:42,265
Pop it with their hash
into John The Ripper,

458
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:43,474
and within minutes,

459
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,224
you have their passwords.

460
00:19:45,474 --> 00:19:48,015
So, you're just gonna change
all your scores to 10's?

461
00:19:48,099 --> 00:19:49,641
Yep.

462
00:19:50,766 --> 00:19:52,099
Can you do mine, too?

463
00:19:52,432 --> 00:19:55,015
I don't actually want them to like me.

464
00:19:55,099 --> 00:19:57,808
I hate them. I really fucking hate them.

465
00:19:57,891 --> 00:20:00,099
I just don't like having 2's.

466
00:20:01,766 --> 00:20:02,724
You know,

467
00:20:02,808 --> 00:20:05,724
I could raise both of our scores

468
00:20:05,808 --> 00:20:08,808
and continue this charade. Or...

469
00:20:08,891 --> 00:20:11,432
I could lower someone else's,

470
00:20:11,808 --> 00:20:15,599
and put an end to these
shenanigans once and for all.

471
00:20:15,683 --> 00:20:17,099
I like it.

472
00:20:22,557 --> 00:20:23,683
Thank you.

473
00:20:23,766 --> 00:20:25,516
It's quite an event, eh?

474
00:20:26,015 --> 00:20:29,265
See down there? It's Facebook, Google,

475
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:31,224
even fucking Bezos sent someone.

476
00:20:31,307 --> 00:20:34,057
All here to support the cause. My cause.

477
00:20:35,724 --> 00:20:37,641
- You know who else showed up?
- Mm.

478
00:20:38,265 --> 00:20:39,849
Starbucks.

479
00:20:40,766 --> 00:20:41,974
Very good company.

480
00:20:42,057 --> 00:20:44,808
Filled with smart people with bold ideas.

481
00:20:45,265 --> 00:20:46,766
- I suppose.
- Also,

482
00:20:47,432 --> 00:20:49,516
Anusol Plus.

483
00:20:50,224 --> 00:20:51,808
Do you have hemorrhoids, Gavin?

484
00:20:51,891 --> 00:20:53,599
Not currently.

485
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,474
Made by Johnson & Johnson,
also a good company.

486
00:20:56,557 --> 00:20:57,766
Do you know what they do?

487
00:20:57,849 --> 00:21:00,391
They spark solutions

488
00:21:00,474 --> 00:21:03,140
that create a better, healthier world.

489
00:21:03,224 --> 00:21:04,683
Just like you.

490
00:21:04,766 --> 00:21:05,933
You remember writing that?

491
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:07,140
I'm a busy man, Richard.

492
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,891
I've lived an incredible life.

493
00:21:08,974 --> 00:21:10,933
I saw a yeti one time,

494
00:21:11,015 --> 00:21:13,391
and forgot for a couple years.

495
00:21:13,474 --> 00:21:14,766
Well,

496
00:21:14,849 --> 00:21:16,933
I ran your little pledge

497
00:21:17,015 --> 00:21:19,516
through a plagiarism detection API.

498
00:21:20,307 --> 00:21:21,599
What are you implying, Richard?

499
00:21:21,683 --> 00:21:24,140
Well, I also looked at transcripts of

500
00:21:24,224 --> 00:21:25,974
your interviews and speeches.

501
00:21:26,182 --> 00:21:29,933
Your commencement speech at
Liberty University. Stolen,

502
00:21:30,182 --> 00:21:32,974
from an obscure Afghan philosopher.

503
00:21:33,182 --> 00:21:35,432
And also, do you see

504
00:21:35,516 --> 00:21:37,015
that guy right there?

505
00:21:37,557 --> 00:21:39,599
That is Rod Morgenstern,

506
00:21:39,683 --> 00:21:41,474
the author of "The Nautilus of Dreams,"

507
00:21:41,557 --> 00:21:44,224
the eBook you blatantly
plagiarized and turned into

508
00:21:44,307 --> 00:21:46,432
"Cold Ice Cream and Hot Kisses."

509
00:21:46,516 --> 00:21:48,265
Do you know how much
harder my life has been

510
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:50,683
- because I cared about ethics?
- Tethics.

511
00:21:50,766 --> 00:21:52,641
I could've lost my company
a dozen different times

512
00:21:52,724 --> 00:21:54,683
because I couldn't compromise

513
00:21:54,766 --> 00:21:56,933
- on my ethics, and now you're
turning ethics... - Tethics.

514
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:59,015
- Tethics. - ...into some kind
of fucking vanity project.

515
00:21:59,099 --> 00:22:01,307
- Tethics, Richard. Tethics.
- Stop it.

516
00:22:01,391 --> 00:22:02,974
Something I came up with on my own.

517
00:22:03,057 --> 00:22:05,724
Well, it sounds fuckin' dumb.

518
00:22:07,641 --> 00:22:08,933
What do you want?

519
00:22:09,391 --> 00:22:11,265
Ever since I turned down your $10 million,

520
00:22:11,349 --> 00:22:14,849
all I ever wanted was for
you to just go away.

521
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:16,683
But, you and Hooli have tried

522
00:22:16,766 --> 00:22:18,724
to fuck me over a thousand different ways.

523
00:22:18,808 --> 00:22:20,808
You're a billionaire. You
can do anything you want.

524
00:22:20,891 --> 00:22:24,349
You can run for president or
buy a fuckin' basketball team,

525
00:22:24,432 --> 00:22:26,599
but you can't do this.

526
00:22:27,224 --> 00:22:28,683
And I'm gonna make sure of it.

527
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,474
So, if you'll excuse me, I have to...

528
00:22:32,224 --> 00:22:33,641
look over my speech.

529
00:22:41,307 --> 00:22:42,224
Hey!

530
00:22:42,307 --> 00:22:44,349
So, you guys raised some issues

531
00:22:44,432 --> 00:22:46,974
with Piper-Pulse, so I really
started looking into it,

532
00:22:47,057 --> 00:22:48,474
and it turns out, there are some...

533
00:22:48,557 --> 00:22:51,849
real problems with its
reliability as a metric. So,

534
00:22:51,933 --> 00:22:53,015
I'm shutting it down.

535
00:22:53,099 --> 00:22:54,307
- Aw.
- Hm.

536
00:22:54,391 --> 00:22:56,474
But the scores are derived
from our coworkers,

537
00:22:56,557 --> 00:22:59,599
the most reliable indicator
of job performance.

538
00:22:59,683 --> 00:23:01,432
Yeah, maybe we could help. You know,

539
00:23:01,516 --> 00:23:03,599
- I'm sure if we took a look
under the hood... - No!

540
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:06,265
Bad system. Didn't work.

541
00:23:06,349 --> 00:23:07,724
Thank you.

542
00:23:25,474 --> 00:23:27,307
Oh, I guess I'm up.

543
00:23:27,391 --> 00:23:29,724
Thank you.

544
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:32,224
Thank you, Elder Red Spirit,

545
00:23:32,307 --> 00:23:34,933
for those profound...

546
00:23:35,015 --> 00:23:36,224
sentiments.

547
00:23:36,307 --> 00:23:37,808
I'm sorry.

548
00:23:39,265 --> 00:23:40,599
I, uh...

549
00:23:40,683 --> 00:23:42,307
I can't do this.

550
00:23:43,224 --> 00:23:44,641
As humbling as it is

551
00:23:44,724 --> 00:23:47,516
to have all of you sitting
here, paying tribute to me,

552
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,808
I have to be honest.

553
00:23:51,349 --> 00:23:53,391
I have been anything but ethical.

554
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:57,265
In truth, I am a plagiarist, and a liar,

555
00:23:57,349 --> 00:24:00,557
and a thief. Ironically, the very...

556
00:24:01,891 --> 00:24:04,891
code of virtue I've asked
you all to abide by was,

557
00:24:04,974 --> 00:24:07,182
in itself, stolen.

558
00:24:07,683 --> 00:24:09,474
And perhaps, some day,

559
00:24:09,557 --> 00:24:11,265
someone may

560
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:13,557
erect a foundation the likes of this.

561
00:24:14,641 --> 00:24:17,474
But it will not be, and should not,

562
00:24:17,557 --> 00:24:18,724
be me.

563
00:24:20,307 --> 00:24:22,974
And in the interest of being truly honest,

564
00:24:23,057 --> 00:24:24,724
this is not new behavior.

565
00:24:24,808 --> 00:24:27,516
I have, for years and years,

566
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:31,015
practiced a parasitic and cynical brand of

567
00:24:31,099 --> 00:24:34,599
predatory capitalism that
leaves nothing to be admired.

568
00:24:34,683 --> 00:24:37,599
Ethics? Not a priority.

569
00:24:37,683 --> 00:24:39,808
In fact, my behavior

570
00:24:39,891 --> 00:24:41,724
may have bordered on criminal.

571
00:24:41,808 --> 00:24:44,808
And to those I have wronged by this,

572
00:24:44,891 --> 00:24:46,224
I apologize.

573
00:24:46,307 --> 00:24:48,766
But apologies are cheap, aren't they?

574
00:24:48,849 --> 00:24:50,557
There must be a reckoning.

575
00:24:50,891 --> 00:24:52,557
Which is why today,

576
00:24:52,641 --> 00:24:54,974
here in this public forum,

577
00:24:55,057 --> 00:24:57,641
I call for the attorney general

578
00:24:57,724 --> 00:24:59,349
of the state of California to launch

579
00:24:59,432 --> 00:25:01,057
an immediate investigation

580
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:04,182
of my conduct as CEO of Hooli...

581
00:25:05,224 --> 00:25:07,766
leaving no stone unturned.

582
00:25:08,099 --> 00:25:10,349
The truth must finally be revealed.

583
00:25:11,224 --> 00:25:12,849
I apologize

584
00:25:12,933 --> 00:25:15,265
for putting you all through
this, especially...

585
00:25:15,516 --> 00:25:18,766
those of you who actually lead lives of...

586
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,265
real virtue.

587
00:25:26,766 --> 00:25:28,474
Hey, Gavin.

588
00:25:28,557 --> 00:25:30,599
I know that wasn't easy.

589
00:25:30,683 --> 00:25:32,182
Sure about that?

590
00:25:32,641 --> 00:25:35,432
Should've taken the $10 million, Richard.

591
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:39,724
Enjoy the injunction, thumbass.

592
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:43,099
What?

593
00:25:43,933 --> 00:25:45,432
Okay, Donny. Yeah, you, too,

594
00:25:45,516 --> 00:25:47,391
and I appreciate it, by the way.

595
00:25:47,474 --> 00:25:49,766
All right, I'll catch you on the flip side.

596
00:25:50,432 --> 00:25:54,099
Okay, so, this is real.

597
00:25:54,182 --> 00:25:57,391
The AG just told me they're
launching an investigation

598
00:25:57,474 --> 00:26:01,057
into Gavin's price fixing and
anti-competitive behavior

599
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,808
while he was at Hooli,

600
00:26:02,891 --> 00:26:04,766
and Gavin called it. So, obviously,

601
00:26:04,849 --> 00:26:07,224
the first move is to file
an injunction against

602
00:26:07,307 --> 00:26:11,349
any further merging between
Hooli and Pied Piper.

603
00:26:11,766 --> 00:26:13,516
Okay. W-what does injunction mean?

604
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:15,391
- What does that mean?
- It means

605
00:26:15,474 --> 00:26:18,599
until this investigation concludes,

606
00:26:18,683 --> 00:26:21,599
you are prohibited from mixing any more

607
00:26:21,683 --> 00:26:24,182
Hooli chocolate with the
Pied Piper peanut butter.

608
00:26:24,265 --> 00:26:28,140
Well, we're in the middle
of merging our codebases.

609
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:30,891
- Yeah, unmerge them.
- Well, that's impossible.

610
00:26:30,974 --> 00:26:34,474
I mean, Christ, we're using
HooliPhones in our Hawaii test.

611
00:26:35,224 --> 00:26:37,557
So, by calling for an investigation

612
00:26:37,641 --> 00:26:40,849
into his own behaviors, he can kill us?

613
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:43,099
Fuckin' Gavin Belson.

614
00:26:43,182 --> 00:26:46,057
Fuckin' Gavin Belson.

615
00:26:48,015 --> 00:26:49,891
Is this fun? I'm sorry.
Are-are you admiring him?

616
00:26:49,974 --> 00:26:52,933
You gotta separate the artist from the art,

617
00:26:53,015 --> 00:26:54,224
Rico. I mean, this is...

618
00:26:54,307 --> 00:26:56,933
elegant, you know? This
is, this is graceful.

619
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:59,140
This is kinda like, uh...

620
00:26:59,224 --> 00:27:01,307
What's the, uh, what's the name of that...

621
00:27:01,391 --> 00:27:03,724
- ballerina dude?
- Baryshnikov.

622
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:05,015
- No.
- Nureyev?

623
00:27:05,099 --> 00:27:08,432
- No...
- Does it fucking matter, Ron? Who cares?

624
00:27:08,516 --> 00:27:10,516
We're paralyzed! We're gonna be broke!

625
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:12,724
Shit, yeah. And,

626
00:27:12,808 --> 00:27:15,224
now Gavin's gonna be able to buy Pied Piper

627
00:27:15,307 --> 00:27:16,974
for pennies on the dollar.

628
00:27:17,057 --> 00:27:20,015
He is under investigation, right?

629
00:27:20,099 --> 00:27:22,891
So, something bad can happen to him.

630
00:27:23,015 --> 00:27:25,015
Worst case, they find
he acted in bad faith,

631
00:27:25,099 --> 00:27:28,391
and then Hooli's gotta pay
a big fine or something.

632
00:27:29,349 --> 00:27:30,933
But you own Hooli, so...

633
00:27:31,015 --> 00:27:33,557
you'd have to pay that fine.

634
00:27:33,641 --> 00:27:35,391
Fucking ninja!

635
00:27:38,349 --> 00:27:39,474
We're dead.

636
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:41,724
Gregory Hines!

637
00:27:42,349 --> 00:27:44,766
Dancer guy. He's an American treasure.

638
00:27:47,557 --> 00:27:49,724
Richard Hendricks!

639
00:27:51,933 --> 00:27:54,057
What's up?

640
00:27:56,057 --> 00:27:58,015
Right? Right?

641
00:27:58,099 --> 00:28:00,182
Read it. Get it?

642
00:28:00,265 --> 00:28:03,641
- Now say it. - Look, Russ, I don't
really have time for you right now.

643
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:06,349
Or your festival, if
that's why you're here.

644
00:28:06,432 --> 00:28:07,891
The Attorney General of California

645
00:28:07,974 --> 00:28:09,557
just signed our fuckin' death warrant.

646
00:28:09,641 --> 00:28:11,516
Yeah, I heard Belson
gaped your asshole today

647
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:13,015
- and not in that fun way.
- Cool.

648
00:28:13,099 --> 00:28:14,766
Great. Well,

649
00:28:14,849 --> 00:28:16,516
I've gotta go inside and
tell everyone, so...

650
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:18,432
No, you don't, you lucky fuck.

651
00:28:20,307 --> 00:28:22,474
Lucky fucky. Richard,

652
00:28:22,557 --> 00:28:24,349
Don Delarenta, the AG of California,

653
00:28:24,432 --> 00:28:26,057
is gonna do whatever the
fuck I tell him to do.

654
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:28,808
- Why?
- 'Cause I have dirt on him.

655
00:28:28,891 --> 00:28:31,015
Two years ago, he had an open-and-shut case

656
00:28:31,099 --> 00:28:33,641
against a guy who committed
terrible crimes,

657
00:28:33,724 --> 00:28:34,974
but he didn't prosecute him

658
00:28:35,057 --> 00:28:36,849
'cause that guy bribed
him and I can prove it.

659
00:28:36,933 --> 00:28:38,849
You think the fuckin' AG is
gonna wanna let the public see

660
00:28:38,933 --> 00:28:41,224
that he didn't prosecute
a guy who did this?

661
00:28:41,307 --> 00:28:43,599
- Oh, my God! Holy fuck!
- Or this?

662
00:28:43,683 --> 00:28:45,849
- Or this? Jesus, look at that.
- Fuck me!

663
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,391
Hold on, wait... Is that you?

664
00:28:47,474 --> 00:28:50,057
Yeah. So is this. This.
Here's portrait mode.

665
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,391
- There's a panoramic in here somewhere.
- I get it, Russ.

666
00:28:52,474 --> 00:28:54,849
Are you the one that committed
the terrible crimes?

667
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:56,724
Yeah. And that dirtbag

668
00:28:56,808 --> 00:28:59,933
let me off because I contributed
half a mil to his campaign.

669
00:29:00,015 --> 00:29:01,474
Now I had told him I'd delete the photos,

670
00:29:01,557 --> 00:29:04,432
but what that moron didn't
count on is that I'd forget.

671
00:29:04,516 --> 00:29:06,808
So, Richard. Question.

672
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,641
Should I make the call?

673
00:29:09,182 --> 00:29:10,516
You ready to dump Hawaii,

674
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:12,182
and join RussFest?

675
00:29:14,307 --> 00:29:16,224
Ah? Ah? Ah?

676
00:29:16,307 --> 00:29:17,974
You're not really giving
me much of a choice.

677
00:29:18,057 --> 00:29:19,140
Ah!

678
00:29:20,349 --> 00:29:22,140
Don Delarenta, please.

679
00:29:22,432 --> 00:29:24,599
Tell him it's Russ Hanneman.

680
00:29:24,683 --> 00:29:26,015
He'll know.

681
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:30,557
Uh, hey, Dinesh?

682
00:29:30,641 --> 00:29:33,224
Oh hey, Dinesh.

683
00:29:36,974 --> 00:29:38,641
Hey, Richard, what's up?

684
00:29:39,683 --> 00:29:42,099
You want me to come home? Like,

685
00:29:42,182 --> 00:29:43,849
leave Hawaii?

686
00:29:43,933 --> 00:29:46,307
No!

687
00:29:46,891 --> 00:29:48,265
Wait, for what?

688
00:29:48,349 --> 00:29:51,516
So, bitches, what do you think?

689
00:29:56,683 --> 00:29:58,224
It's beautiful.

690
00:29:58,307 --> 00:29:59,891
Tres Commas!

691
00:29:59,974 --> 00:30:01,432
Boom!

692
00:31:14,766 --> 00:31:16,724
Hey, Gilfoyle. So, I've
been thinking about your AI

693
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:17,933
and its many deficits...

694
00:31:18,015 --> 00:31:20,015
Your issue may be insecurity,

695
00:31:20,099 --> 00:31:23,474
masked by false bravado and unisex cologne.

696
00:31:23,849 --> 00:31:25,265
It's not unisex.

697
00:31:28,974 --> 00:31:30,432
Richard! Russ Fest!

698
00:31:30,766 --> 00:31:33,849
You told AT&T that the hologram
would be interactive, right?

699
00:31:34,265 --> 00:31:35,057
Yes.

700
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,015
See, asshole?!

701
00:31:36,349 --> 00:31:39,224
My hologram can 100 percent
dry hump festival goers

702
00:31:39,307 --> 00:31:40,099
from behind.
