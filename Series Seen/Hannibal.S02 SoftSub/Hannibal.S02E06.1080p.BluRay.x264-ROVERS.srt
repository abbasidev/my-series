1
00:00:02,293 --> 00:00:03,794
Previously on Hannibal...

2
00:00:03,878 --> 00:00:06,880
Do not discuss me with Hannibal Lecter.

3
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:08,215
I brought Gideon back

4
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:11,593
because I thought he may be useful
in Will Graham's therapy.

5
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:14,930
I'm going to give you a chance
to save Will from himself.

6
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,932
Who does he want to kill, Doctor?

7
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,101
I want you to kill Hannibal Lecter.

8
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:21,311
Will Graham is not a murderer.

9
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:22,855
He asked you to do this?

10
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:26,108
Get an ambulance!

11
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:28,128
You're moving smoothly and slowly, Jack.

12
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:33,008
Carrying your concentration
like a brimming cup.

13
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:36,470
Hannibal Lecter was almost murdered

14
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,641
by an employee of this hospital.

15
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,811
An attendant

16
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:47,731
who we believe is the person that

17
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,651
killed the bailiff and the judge
at your murder trial.

18
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:53,362
He killed the bailiff, he didn't kill the judge.

19
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:57,157
- That was the Chesapeake Ripper.
- You know this?

20
00:01:58,493 --> 00:01:59,493
He told me.

21
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:01,995
Then you told him to kill Hannibal.

22
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,833
Nothing I said made that happen, Jack.

23
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,836
It just happened.

24
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,630
"It just happened."

25
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:15,008
You don't seem to be too broken up about it.

26
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:20,472
There's a common emotion we all recognize
and have not yet named.

27
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:26,770
The happy anticipation
of being able to feel contempt.

28
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,857
You feel contempt for Hannibal?

29
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:33,402
Well, I have contempt for the Ripper.
I have contempt for what he does.

30
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,821
- And what does he do?
- What does he do?

31
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:40,784
What is the first
and principal thing he does?

32
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:43,537
What need does he serve by killing?

33
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,331
He harvests organs.

34
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:51,003
No, that's only the action of what
he does. Why does he need to do it?

35
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:55,799
The Ripper kills in sounders
of three or four in quick order.

36
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,469
Do you know why?

37
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,182
I know why.

38
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,273
Then tell me.

39
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:16,695
Because if he waits too long,
then the meat spoils.

40
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,989
He's eating them?

41
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,493
Hannibal is like Garret Jacob Hobbs?
A cannibal?

42
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,537
No, not like Garret Jacob Hobbs.

43
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,080
Hobbs ate his victims to honor them.

44
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:31,210
The Ripper eats his victims because
they're no better to him than pigs.

45
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,671
With the exception of Beverly Katz,

46
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:38,425
there is no connection between Hannibal
and any Ripper victims.

47
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:40,594
No immediate connection.

48
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:45,140
Hannibal Lecter is not
the Chesapeake Ripper.

49
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,808
If the Ripper's killing,

50
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,436
you can bet Hannibal Lecter's
planning a dinner party.

51
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,482
You and I probably sipped wine
while swallowing the people

52
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,984
to whom we were trying
to give justice, Jack.

53
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:05,118
Who does he have to kill
before you open your eyes?

54
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,043
A remarkably lean organ, the heart,

55
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:15,629
yet such a potent symbol of life

56
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:19,967
and the things that make us human.

57
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,510
Good and bad,

58
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,262
love and ache.

59
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:26,640
All of them skewered.

60
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,601
It's a thematic dish.

61
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,772
My heart certainly feels skewered.

62
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,484
You have the scars to prove it.

63
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:42,447
It feels as if that noose
is still around my neck.

64
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,995
Strange having nightmares. I never used to.

65
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,873
Don't make the same mistake I've made.

66
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,585
Being your own psychiatrist.

67
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,382
I'm always assessing my feelings
instead of acting on them.

68
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:03,218
It's the safest course.

69
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:08,098
You have to find a way
to deal with what happened to you.

70
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:15,314
I'm metabolizing the experience
by composing a new piece of music.

71
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,361
Harpsichord or Theremin?

72
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,155
Harpsichord.

73
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:27,284
Stravinsky said a true composer

74
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,953
thinks about his unfinished work
the whole time.

75
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,665
He's not always conscious of this,
but he's aware of it

76
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,625
when he suddenly knows what to do.

77
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,377
And do you know what to do?

78
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:40,630
I need to get my appetite back.

79
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,797
What do we got?

80
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:07,342
He's literally grafted in place.
These are living roots.

81
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,928
He's got varicose vines.

82
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:12,389
Threaded through, from his heels,

83
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:16,726
under his legs, his back,
through his torso, out his fingertips.

84
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,647
Followed some pretty tricky
endoscopic surgical paths.

85
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:23,024
Chesapeake Ripper
usually cherry-picks his organs.

86
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:26,153
He took almost all of them.
Everything but the lungs.

87
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,660
The time that he devotes to his work...

88
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:37,873
He really takes pride.

89
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,376
Belladonna for the heart.

90
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,628
Chain of white oleander for the intestines.

91
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,589
Ragwort for the liver.

92
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,257
These flowers are all poisonous.

93
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:49,342
Yes. This is judgment.

94
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:54,514
The Ripper believes
that his victim was toxic somehow.

95
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,766
A poisonous man.

96
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:00,479
He's so damn certain, he makes me sick.

97
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:16,161
There is a pattern taking shape.

98
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,789
I just have to convince my eyes to see it.

99
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:25,629
I've convinced myself of something
I had refused to see for a long time.

100
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,925
And it only took Will Graham
trying to kill you to see it?

101
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,092
Yes.

102
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,429
I can't help Will.

103
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:37,057
I can't trust him.

104
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:41,811
He's in a dark place
where the shadows move,

105
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,523
and it's not safe to stand with him anymore.

106
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,942
I feel the same way.

107
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:54,866
We found another Ripper victim...

108
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,244
I'm sorry, Jack. I can't.

109
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:03,959
Not only do I have to let Will go,
I have to let this all go.

110
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,837
I nearly died.

111
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,508
I would have if it weren't for you.

112
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:18,181
I'm sorry. I can't dwell on death anymore.

113
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,100
I don't blame you.

114
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:25,355
We both have to transform
our misfortunes into life enhancing events.

115
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:31,486
Well, when you figure out
how to do that, do let me know.

116
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,907
I'm going to start by hosting a dinner party.

117
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,122
And please tell me you'll come.

118
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,457
I wouldn't miss it.

119
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,967
You should've let him die.

120
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,803
Shoulda, coulda, woulda.

121
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,266
He's gonna kill you, you know.

122
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,061
Can't get me in here.

123
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:08,481
No, here is exactly where he'll get you, Abel.

124
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:13,069
The moment I convinced the chief of staff
to put you in a cell next to me,

125
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:16,072
you were stamped with an expiration date.

126
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:21,411
Anyone who gets too close gets got.

127
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:25,915
He's the devil, remember? Smoke.

128
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:31,296
I'd be very nervous if I was Dr. Chilton.

129
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,757
He's getting close, too.

130
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:37,093
The only way you and Frederick
are gonna get out of this alive

131
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,679
is if the Chesapeake Ripper is stopped.

132
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:44,559
Hannibal Lecter deserves to die.

133
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,145
You didn't bring me here
to help you kill Hannibal Lecter.

134
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,689
No, I didn't,
I brought you here to bear witness.

135
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,692
To tell Jack Crawford that I sat

136
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:56,237
in Hannibal Lecter's cobalt blue
dining room,

137
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,657
an ostentatious herb garden

138
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:02,702
with Leda and the swan over the fireplace
and you having a fit in the corner.

139
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,996
That's where I asked him
if he was the Chesapeake Ripper,

140
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:09,167
and he avoided the question
and suggested I kill Alana Bloom.

141
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,127
Yes.

142
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,339
Tell Jack that.

143
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:16,466
I'll tell Jack Crawford everything

144
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,511
if you tell me why Hannibal did it.

145
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,937
Because he wanted to see
what would happen.

146
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,440
That's where I asked him
if he was the Chesapeake Ripper

147
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:36,861
and he avoided the question
and suggested I kill Alana Bloom.

148
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,574
Abel Gideon is a lunatic.

149
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,745
He is psychotic, not psychic.

150
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:51,251
We know that Gideon has a history
of being susceptible to suggestion.

151
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:55,839
The simplest explanation as to why
he can describe Hannibal Lecter's home

152
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,091
is that he was in Hannibal Lecter's home.

153
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,388
Will Graham could've given him the details.

154
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:05,432
No such details were given.

155
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,935
There has not been a word exchanged
between those two men

156
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:11,521
in my hospital that I have not heard.

157
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:15,358
Then you're aware
what Will is accusing Hannibal Lecter of?

158
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:19,320
Yes. I am aware.

159
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:23,241
And I am grateful that
I have trouble digesting animal proteins,

160
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:26,911
as the last meals I have shared
with Hannibal Lecter have all been salads.

161
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,247
Do you believe him?

162
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:34,169
Hannibal once served me tongue
and then made a joke about eating mine.

163
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:40,216
It would be narrow
to not at least consider it.

164
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,635
Will is delusional.

165
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,475
He would like to reinforce his delusion
with you, with me, with Abel Gideon.

166
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,935
That doesn't mean he is not right.

167
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,313
No, it doesn't.

168
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,862
The Chesapeake Ripper is killing again.

169
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:05,617
And Hannibal Lecter
is throwing a dinner party.

170
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,620
Jack, he fits the profile.

171
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,957
He is attracted to medical
and psychological fields

172
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,710
because they offer power over man.

173
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,047
Cannibalism...

174
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,510
Cannibalism is an act of dominance.

175
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,995
His name's Sheldon Isley!

176
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,455
A Baltimore city councilman!

177
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,332
Ripper's a politician now!

178
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,628
At least a conservationist.

179
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:45,967
Five, six years ago, Isley brokered
a woodlands development deal

180
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,511
despite the disapproval of the EPA.

181
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:51,472
So the councilman paved paradise
and put up a parking lot, huh?

182
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,433
Well, what he paved was

183
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:56,936
an important nesting habitat
for endangered songbirds.

184
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,104
The son of a bitch.

185
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,857
He was wearing this as a crown.

186
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:05,528
Autopsy report gave us what you'd expect
from the Chesapeake Ripper.

187
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:08,197
Pre-mortem surgical dissection,
latex glove impressions.

188
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,825
Body was posed before rigor set in.

189
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,828
- What did the lungs cough up?
- Water.

190
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,915
The councilman was drowned.
Lungs filled with aspirated water.

191
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:21,294
He was standing in water up to his thighs
for 48 to 72 hours before he died.

192
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:24,756
- To feed the tree.
- Possibly.

193
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,466
Now, here's the exciting part.

194
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:30,303
Tree man actually bears fruit.

195
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:34,015
Diatoms, unicellular colonies.
Good as fingerprints.

196
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:37,143
No two water sources have
the same diatom population.

197
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:40,480
Water in the lungs gives us
location of death. Show me.

198
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,276
Here, in a 50 mile radius.

199
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:57,163
My head is filled with conspiracies.
Too many versions of events.

200
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:01,042
He said she said. He said she said she said.

201
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,502
It's just maddening.

202
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:04,921
In my experience, that means

203
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:08,591
a lot of people are lying
about a lot of different things.

204
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,427
Well, the one thing I have clarity on
is Will Graham tried to kill Hannibal.

205
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,555
And thinks it was a righteous act.

206
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,350
Well, that says more about Will
than it does about Hannibal.

207
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:22,105
Hannibal's been a teacher,
a mentor, and a friend.

208
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,524
I've known him before
you, or Will, or any of this.

209
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,859
I don't claim to know anyone.

210
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:33,866
I look at these dogs,
I see the best part of Will.

211
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:38,496
But he's lying. He's manipulating.

212
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:42,208
He's playing a game
and he's not scared, not anymore.

213
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,629
That's what's making him dangerous.

214
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,339
Hello, Dr. Lecter.

215
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:40,433
I feel like I've been watching
our friendship on a split screen.

216
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,644
The friendship I perceived on one side

217
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,439
and the truth on the other.

218
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:50,193
It's a terrible feeling, isn't it?

219
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,114
You've been lying to me, Will.

220
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,743
Well, I don't have a gauge for reality

221
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:01,996
that works well enough
to know if I've been lying.

222
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:05,124
But you understand the reality
of Beverly Katz's death.

223
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,126
You understand your role in that.

224
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,003
What was my role?

225
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,924
Beverly died at your behest.

226
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:18,554
You are as angry with yourself
as you are with whoever murdered her.

227
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:21,682
Actually,

228
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:25,311
I am singularly angry
with whoever murdered her.

229
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,942
You tried to kill me, Will.

230
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:34,153
It's hard not to take that personally.

231
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,948
However, if I were Beverly's murderer,

232
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,285
I'd applaud your effort.

233
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,122
I'm no more guilty
of what you've accused me of

234
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:47,583
than you are of what I've accused you of.

235
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:54,340
I don't expect you to feel self-loathing,
or regret, or shame.

236
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,928
You knew what you were doing,
and you made your own decisions,

237
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:01,764
decisions that were under your control.

238
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,100
You think I'm in control?

239
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:07,687
I think you are more in control now
than you have ever been.

240
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,733
You found a way to hurt me.

241
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:19,448
I wonder how many more people are
going to get hurt by what you do.

242
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:25,454
I'll give Alana Bloom your best.

243
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,541
Goodbye, Will.

244
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:18,025
So, it seems all the king's horses
and all the king's men

245
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,820
could indeed put Humpty together again.

246
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,864
Is everything back where I found it?

247
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,326
With one or two exceptions.

248
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,872
I know people who consider me autocratic.

249
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,375
I'm not the most loved of administrators,

250
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:38,212
but that nurse you murdered,
she was well liked

251
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,214
and so were the attendants you killed.

252
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:46,178
There is nothing like grief and trauma
to pull people together.

253
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,932
Jack Crawford would like
to have a word with you.

254
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:55,187
I trust you will behave yourself, Abel.

255
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:02,111
I'm sure you and Frederick

256
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:06,490
have had many a conversation
about my bad behavior, Jack.

257
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,034
How does he describe me?

258
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:10,411
A pure sociopath, by the book.

259
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:13,956
- Is that by your book, Frederick?
- Yes.

260
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:17,209
I would just like to point out
that the word "sociopath" has not been used

261
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:20,171
by any respected psychiatrist since 1968.

262
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:23,841
Dr. Gideon, do you have any information
about the Chesapeake Ripper, or not?

263
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:25,051
Down to brass tacks.

264
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:27,345
You told Will Graham
that you were in Dr. Lecter's home.

265
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,471
Why were you there?

266
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:31,057
I have never set foot in Dr. Lecter's home.

267
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:33,100
I only met the man a week ago.

268
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:37,104
However, Dr. Chilton was kind enough
to share the details of his dining room.

269
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,272
Why would he do that?

270
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,358
Yes, why would he do that?

271
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:47,740
Will Graham is very keen to believe that
Hannibal Lecter is the Chesapeake Ripper.

272
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:52,119
Dr. Chilton did very little
to disavow him of that notion

273
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,954
and encouraged me to do the same.

274
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:57,917
I apologize, Agent Crawford,
for wasting your time.

275
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:03,464
It's not your actions and betrayal
that I resent, Dr. Chilton.

276
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,216
It's just the lies.

277
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:08,803
- I'll walk you out.
- Thank you.

278
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:13,891
Dr. Chilton hired a nurse
who's had experience in mental hospitals,

279
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:16,477
but not as an employee.

280
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:20,022
That nurse attempted
to murder Hannibal Lecter,

281
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:22,942
and you blame Will Graham.

282
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:28,864
You got the right box there, Jack,
but you're looking in the wrong corner.

283
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:38,624
All the coiled resentment in this place,
it's gotta be bad for the digestion.

284
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:43,879
You know that poor Nurse Shell
that I murdered?

285
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:47,508
I know she's seen
as some kind of beloved sister,

286
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:52,388
but wasn't she also kind of a good-time girl
with a beer or two inside her?

287
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:55,349
I asked her if she had eyes for me,
she said no.

288
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:56,934
So I had to take 'em.

289
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,864
Prosciutto roses.

290
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,200
Heart tartare.

291
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,785
Beef roulade.

292
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,623
Whatever this is.

293
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,042
Needless to say,

294
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:30,337
I will not be eating the food.

295
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:33,173
Nice to see you again, Dr. Chilton.

296
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,385
Hannibal the cannibal.

297
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:39,597
That is what they'll call him, you know.

298
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,432
Not according to Abel Gideon.

299
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:44,143
Gideon has given me
enough trouble for one day.

300
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:46,270
The fact that he lied to you
makes me even more certain

301
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:47,896
he was telling Will Graham the truth.

302
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:51,483
Why did you come here tonight
if you're so convinced?

303
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:53,569
Darwinism.

304
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:55,988
I do not want him
to think I suspect anything.

305
00:26:57,824 --> 00:27:00,826
I really shouldn't be seen speaking to you.

306
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:05,164
I don't want to be perceived as a threat.

307
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:11,462
Jack.

308
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:14,965
I'm so happy you're here.
After all, you are the guest of honor.

309
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,091
You saved my life.

310
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:18,844
Unfortunately, my friend, I can't stay.

311
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,765
I would love to take some food to go,
if that's all right.

312
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:26,018
Of course. I'll get one of the staff
to get you something from the kitchen.

313
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:28,270
No, no. That's all right.
Just bring me a container

314
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,648
and I'll serve myself from here.

315
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:33,359
With your permission, of course, Dr. Lecter.

316
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,195
Hello, Jack.

317
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:38,238
Hello, Alana.

318
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,367
I do have your permission, Dr. Lecter?

319
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:45,120
- Help yourself.
- Thank you.

320
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,375
Eat it soon or it'll spoil.

321
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:55,673
Thank you.

322
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:57,675
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

323
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:17,277
Z.

324
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,155
Test this.

325
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:41,802
Well, the ending to my composition
has been eluding me,

326
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:44,805
but you may just have solved that problem
with chopsticks.

327
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:59,778
If only every problem
could be solved with a simple waltz.

328
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:07,953
Jack's treating you like a suspect.

329
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,957
Pointing fingers in the dark.

330
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:19,089
I've walked away from Will,
but I'm still trailing his accusations.

331
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,469
I walked away, too.

332
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:26,513
I can't forgive Will for what he did to you.

333
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:31,560
I just want to walk away from all of it.

334
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:34,438
What does walking away leave us?

335
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:37,649
Each other.

336
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:51,283
Hello, Dr. Gideon.

337
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:14,806
Put the heart monitor on the guard
so no one knew Gideon was missing,

338
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:18,560
at least as long as it took
for the guard to die, which wasn't long.

339
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:19,895
It was long enough.

340
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:22,105
He was strung up with fish hooks.

341
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:25,567
Hand-tied flies,
just like Will Graham used to make.

342
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:29,404
This one has a human hair in it, and a tooth.

343
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:33,533
Jack, there is no way Gideon
could've done any of this

344
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,744
with the injuries he had,
much less get out of bed.

345
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:40,082
Well, the last time Gideon escaped custody,
he went looking for the Chesapeake Ripper.

346
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:41,667
He found him, all right.

347
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:47,673
Last night the Ripper found Gideon.

348
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:12,781
You're awake.

349
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:15,617
So are you.

350
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:22,124
I was thinking about funerals,

351
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:25,544
how often they make us want sex.

352
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,632
It's one in the eye for death.

353
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,217
Not that...

354
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:36,722
- This wasn't funeral sex or...
- Of course it was.

355
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:41,268
We both just buried a friend.

356
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:44,229
We buried Will.

357
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:50,819
There's something liberating
about finally letting him go.

358
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:56,867
Yes. There is.

359
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:08,545
We have a lot of reasons to do this,

360
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:10,630
not just funeral reasons.

361
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:21,683
Last time someone rang
my doorbell this early,

362
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,602
it was a census taker.

363
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,111
I'll see who it is.

364
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,336
- Jack.
- Hannibal.

365
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:53,882
- What can I do for you?
- We need to talk.

366
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:02,974
Abel Gideon fell down a stairwell last night.

367
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:04,601
He was hospitalized.

368
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:07,896
The security guard standing
watch has been killed

369
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:11,733
in what appears to be another
Chesapeake Ripper murder.

370
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,152
Gideon is nowhere to be found.

371
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,403
He escaped?

372
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:16,988
We know he didn't
leave the hospital on his own.

373
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:19,741
His back was broken.
He was taken by someone.

374
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,660
Someone who knew him.

375
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,415
Where were you last night?

376
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,171
I was here.

377
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,049
All night?

378
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,134
Yes.

379
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:41,096
Anyone other than yourself
that can verify that?

380
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,223
I can.

381
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:48,937
I was with Hannibal all night, Jack.

382
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:54,568
What are you accusing him of?

383
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:58,321
I'm not accusing him of anything,
only asking his whereabouts.

384
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,699
That's not all you're asking.

385
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,072
Rôti de cuisse.

386
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,575
Clay-roasted thigh

387
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:47,704
and canoe-cut marrow bone.

388
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,094
I love cooking with clay.

389
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,765
It creates a more succulent dish

390
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:10,435
and adds a little theatricality to dinner.

391
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:14,439
We come from clay, return to clay.

392
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:18,944
Shall I carve?

393
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:21,738
I think you already have.

394
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:26,076
Your legs are no good to you anymore.

395
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,495
You've got a T4 fracture of the vertebra.

396
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:32,832
This is a far more practical use
for those limbs.

397
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:39,839
Hard to have anything, isn't it, Dr. Lecter?

398
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,468
Rare to get it, hard to keep it.

399
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,305
A damn slippery life.

400
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:57,440
You were determined to know
the Chesapeake Ripper, Dr. Gideon.

401
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,611
Now is your opportunity.

402
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:05,365
You intend me to be my own last supper?

403
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:06,783
Yes.

404
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:14,374
How does one politely refuse a dish
in circumstances such as these?

405
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,210
One doesn't.

406
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:20,672
The tragedy is not to die, Abel,

407
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,841
but to be wasted.

408
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,248
My compliments to the chef.

409
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:02,005
- Goose, pig, cow.
- Not just cow, Wagyu beef.

410
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:05,175
There's about $100 worth right there.

411
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:06,301
How do you know it's not Kobe?

412
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:07,927
Well, all Kobe is Wagyu,

413
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,472
- not all Wagyu is Kobe.
- Okay.

414
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:12,682
Well, at least we know
Dr. Lecter wasn't serving up people.

415
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:13,808
You want people?

416
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:17,937
The Chesapeake Ripper
has been tying flies with them,

417
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,690
just like Will Graham allegedly did.

418
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:25,487
Hair woven into
the mono filament is Beverly's,

419
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:27,405
bone fragments of Miriam Lass.

420
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,741
Veining from Sheldon Isley,

421
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:32,202
optical nerve and arteries
from Judge Davies,

422
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:35,914
and a toenail from James Gray, our muralist.

423
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,458
All victims of the Chesapeake Ripper.

424
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:41,878
These four lures are almost identical
to what we found in Will's house,

425
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:44,839
made with material from
the exact same human remains.

426
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:49,969
Abigail Hobbs, Donald Sutcliffe,
Marissa Schurr, Georgia Madchen.

427
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:54,140
Will didn't kill any of these people.

428
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:57,685
There was no copycat, never was.

429
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:01,773
It was always the Ripper.

430
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,984
Finally taking credit for all of his murders.

431
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:09,531
Maybe too much credit.
Found something else in the lures.

432
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:14,744
Madrona bark.
A tree almost non-existent on the east coast,

433
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:17,205
but this bark was peeled recently.

434
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:20,041
There's a small stand
of madrona bark in Virginia.

435
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,668
Inside your diatom search area?

436
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:25,130
Yep.

437
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:27,173
Here.

438
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:25,208
Miriam.
