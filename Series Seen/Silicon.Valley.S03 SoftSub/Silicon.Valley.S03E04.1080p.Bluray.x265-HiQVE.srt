1
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,004
Quite a plan you boys cooked up here.

2
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,365
Quite a plan.

3
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,931
I'm not sure what upsets me more,

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,804
that I have four employees
that conspired to commit felony fraud,

5
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,724
or that I have four employees
that are so stupid

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,280
I found out about it within 30 seconds.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,810
Hearing it out loud, the first one seems worse.

8
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,521
We got sales, manufacturing,
design, assembly,

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,768
logistics teams, they're all ready to go.

10
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,482
All of them on the payroll,
all of them here to build me a box.

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,251
I have a deal, in principle,
with Maleant to buy the box.

12
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,842
The second that we deliver a product
that meets those specs,

13
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,649
we are cashing checks!

14
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,890
And you are the only four people
in this building that are fighting me on it!

15
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,726
So give me one reason
why I don't fire you right now,

16
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,930
claw back your options,
make you unhireable all over town.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,844
One goddamn reason!

18
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,961
Because you can't.

19
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,806
Excuse me?

20
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,850
This agreement says that you have 10 weeks

21
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,844
to complete a working prototype
before the deal expires.

22
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,766
So how are you gonna do that if you fire us?

23
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:35,081
There are maybe eight engineers on Earth
proficient in middle-out compression.

24
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,606
Five of them work for EndFrame,
your competition,

25
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,160
and three of them are here
in this office right now.

26
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,801
So if we're gone, I don't think
you're ever going to get your box.

27
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,601
What do you want?

28
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,081
I want to build my platform. Now.

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,890
To complete the box project,
it's going to take six months at least.

30
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,364
So, what I think maybe we should do is

31
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,086
take a little tip from your chart there
and we compromise.

32
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:06,887
Compromise is the shared hypotenuse
of the conjoined triangles of success.

33
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,281
Mmm-hmm. Yep.

34
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,931
So, uh, what I'm proposing

35
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,804
is we stand up the prototype, that's it.

36
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:19,681
We're not doing any custom features,
no new versions, no maintenance, nothing.

37
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,846
Richard, the Maleant basement.

38
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,251
And no onsite support.

39
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,767
I think you can hire other engineers
to do that fucking mole monkey work.

40
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,684
The second we write code that satisfies
the basic minimum requirement of the deal,

41
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,889
we are off the box and on to the platform.

42
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,248
And that is my final offer.

43
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,849
So, what do you say to that...

44
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,921
- Whoa!
- Ow!

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,525
- Richie!
- Oh, my God!

46
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,170
Hey, hey. You okay?

47
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,607
- You were standing and then what happened?
- Okay, I'm okay.

48
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,523
-It's just a little shocking.
- Oh.

49
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,001
What were you saying? Did you...
Do we have a deal or...

50
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,084
Yeah, Richard, we have a deal.
You have a bloody nose.

51
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,288
That was pretty badass, Richard.

52
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,600
Until it wasn't.

53
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,489
Uh, this is not even a room.

54
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,523
This is a hallway.

55
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:24,281
Uh, it can't be because that is a bed,
thus, this is a bedroom.

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,527
Two entrances and exits, cross drafts ahoy.

57
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,005
And it is the safest room in the event,
unlikely, of a fire.

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,968
Ah. Oopsies. Don't mind me.

59
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,769
Ah, Fred, this is Jared.

60
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,571
He actually is, uh, a temporary resident.

61
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,723
While I have you,
there were fresh droppings near my cot.

62
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,801
I think you were right.

63
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,565
The Havahart traps don't seem to be working.

64
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,725
I was thinking maybe we could just pick a day
and just drench it in hawk urine,

65
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,724
because the scent of a predator
can keep rodents at bay.

66
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,122
It's funny, we're named Pied Piper,
but we're beset with rats.

67
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,125
Little rascals.

68
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,960
Fuck this.

69
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:11,410
I've been writing quick, bullshit subpar code
for 48 hours, and I want to kill myself.

70
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,322
How do you do it every day, Dinesh?

71
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,601
What a coincidence.

72
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,445
I've also been writing bullshit code
for 48 hours,

73
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,568
and want you to kill yourself.

74
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,281
Guys, please. Let's just shit this thing out
so we can get on to building the platform.

75
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,881
Hi.

76
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,845
- Hi.
- Dang.

77
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,484
- What?
- I'm Dang.

78
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,841
I'm dang?

79
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,361
Dang.

80
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,240
What...

81
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,367
My name is Dang.

82
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,131
Oh, my... I'm sorry. What can I do for you?

83
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,170
I'm heading the design team
that's building the enclosure for the box.

84
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,288
It's time for the concept meeting.

85
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,210
"Concept meeting?"

86
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,284
Okay. I'm just going to
show you a few pictures,

87
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,362
and you tell me which ones you like, okay?

88
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,720
Okay. Sure.

89
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,682
Look... Wait, hold on.

90
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,081
I thought you were going to
show me pictures of boxes.

91
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,764
Like data storage devices.

92
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,887
Before I can actualize a box,

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,970
you and I need to develop
a shared aesthetic vocabulary.

94
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,042
Otherwise, I have no idea
what you're going to want.

95
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,247
I have a lot of work to do right now.

96
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,846
This is work. This is my work.

97
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,321
What we're doing here
could actually save time.

98
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,731
Okay. Sure. Yeah...

99
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,848
Look, let's just make this simple.

100
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,685
If the box were an animal,
what sort of animal would it be?

101
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,486
Leopard?

102
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,162
Butterfly? Rhinoceros?

103
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,049
Stop. Animal?

104
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,690
It's a box. Right?

105
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:46,368
Okay, so if you need an animal,
make it a box turtle. How does that sound?

106
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,361
So this is all kind of a joke to you?

107
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,525
You know what? I don't actually give
a flying fuck what this box looks like, okay?

108
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,046
If it was up to me,
I wouldn't even have it in the first place.

109
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,201
So, look, here.

110
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,126
This is a black rectangle.

111
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,726
Make it that, all right?

112
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,366
Because we're going to take it
and put it in a hole

113
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,886
in a sub-basement in a data center,
where no one can see it

114
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,442
except for a sad man
named John with a ponytail. Okay?

115
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,046
Just make it a box.

116
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,327
And please turn off that fucking music.

117
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,721
Hello!

118
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,568
It appears there has been a mistake.

119
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,325
Is this not my parking space?

120
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,370
Sorry, a lot of premium spaces
are being reassigned.

121
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,808
14-A, you've been reassigned to lot D.

122
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,401
Lot D?

123
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,970
The structure?

124
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,325
Beyond the freeway?

125
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,210
Anywhere above level three,
those are reserved.

126
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,328
There's a shuttle stop on the ground level.

127
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,847
A shuttle?

128
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,731
Call Gavin Belson. Cell.

129
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,167
Greetings, friend,

130
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,285
<i>I'm not available right now.
Please leave a message after the beep.</i>

131
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,328
<i>- I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
{HORN HONKS</i>

132
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,165
What the fuck?
Why isn't this working?

133
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,441
Gilfoyle's preprocessor and my compressor
should integrate seamlessly.

134
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,691
This should work.

135
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,325
I may have made my preprocessor
slightly faster than you asked me to, Richard.

136
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,728
What do you mean?
How much "slightly faster"?

137
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,565
200 megs per second.

138
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,766
You dick.

139
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,047
That's eight times as fast
as the specs required.

140
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,282
No wonder our modules
aren't running at the same speed.

141
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,566
Why would you do that?

142
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,441
I tried to make it slow. I really did.
But I'm not Dinesh.

143
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,288
It's very difficult for me to do shitty work.

144
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,244
So, I added a differencing library

145
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,891
and then the whole thing
just took off like a rocket.

146
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,768
Wait, so you're not processing whole files,
just the changes?

147
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,484
That's actually pretty cool.

148
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,721
Yeah, I thought so, too.

149
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,205
That's why I wrote it.

150
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,562
All right, well,
I guess I should just revert back.

151
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,485
Right?

152
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,762
Slow my preprocessor way down.

153
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,005
Although, Richard,

154
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,642
couldn't you just rewrite the compressor
to make it faster so it's compatible?

155
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,609
I mean, these are minimum speeds, right?

156
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:33,004
Just 'cause making the box sucks
doesn't mean we have to suck at making it.

157
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,646
Yeah. Okay. Um, here's one idea. Uh...

158
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,602
What if we actually move upstream
and connect the parser...

159
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,570
Directly to the compressor
seed functions.

160
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,685
Okay.

161
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,444
Well, then, the whole thing would really fly.

162
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,444
- Yeah.
- That would rock.

163
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,601
Hey, Richard, do you have a sec?

164
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,484
I have a preliminary render for you.

165
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,641
What is that?

166
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,571
What do you mean? It's a box.

167
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,202
That's not our box, is it?

168
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,362
Yes. It's exactly what you asked me for.

169
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,842
You drew a rectangle and said,
"if it was an animal, it'd be a box turtle."

170
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,890
I mean, are you just going to do
the bare minimum and call it a day?

171
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,121
I mean, is that, like, what you do?

172
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,641
You said it didn't matter,
you said you didn't care.

173
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,848
No one's caring about this.
I'm just saying, like,

174
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,843
it's just a matter of pride
and, like, self-respect.

175
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,251
I mean, that's gonna go on brochures, man,

176
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,244
that's like an advertisement to you
and the company and everything.

177
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,403
I can maybe add some color to it
and give the bezel a little slam.

178
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,482
There you go. Definitely, a slam. Slam it.

179
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,800
Yeah, maybe add some more lights.

180
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,881
Sure. Yeah.

181
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,122
Well, hey, what are you doing
standing around here talking about it?

182
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,202
You should go do it, you know?
Go ahead and make the damn thing.

183
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,682
Make it a jaguar 'cause I have a feeling
this baby is going to purr.

184
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,845
I don't care either, but, you know,
I think maybe a gazelle is more like it.

185
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,570
'Cause it's synonymous with speed.

186
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,120
Fuck that. A cheetah's faster.

187
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,611
And it kills fucking gazelles.

188
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,091
But I really don't fucking care.

189
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,924
But definitely cheetah.

190
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,126
Or a gazelle.

191
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,969
Also, don't throw away
the whole jaguar thing,

192
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,530
-yeah, 'cause they're pretty quick too.
- Or a gazelle.

193
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,163
Ah! Jared, Jesus fuck! What are you doing?

194
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,765
Sorry. I was...

195
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,525
I was just taking a quiet moment
to collect myself.

196
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,605
What the hell is all this shit?

197
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,604
My tenant has been leaving my belongings
in the alley behind my condo,

198
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,370
to make more room for his tenants.

199
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,726
Your tenant has tenants?

200
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,207
Yeah.

201
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,282
He's Airbnbing my Airbnb.

202
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,570
So, if it's okay with you,
I might need to stay a little bit longer.

203
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,803
Um, I can go around the back
to get to the bathroom once Fred's here.

204
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,881
When's he moving in?

205
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,724
Wouldn't we all like to know.

206
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,724
Fred, Erlich Bachman.

207
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,645
You said you'd get back to me
about the room.

208
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,530
I don't mean to pressure you,
but I need you to decide now.

209
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,648
In this moment, on this phone call.

210
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,361
I am literally standing within feet
of three potential candidates

211
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,205
whose selves I could easily tell to go fuck...

212
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,604
"Good"? What do you mean "good"?
What does that mean, you're "good"?

213
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,285
What? What other incubator? Where?

214
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,730
What is the address?

215
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,526
Because I want to send them
a fucking nice gift!

216
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,843
<i>Fucking Miami Vice. Disgusting architecture!</i>

217
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,561
Hey, man. What are you doing here?

218
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,210
What the fuck are you doing here?

219
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,521
What do you mean? This is my house.
Crazy, right?

220
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,807
This place is huge.

221
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,411
Did you want to...

222
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,486
Yes, it would be polite
for you to invite me into your home

223
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,483
and offer me a Push Pop, yes.

224
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,686
I'm sorry.

225
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,048
You're telling me that
we should spend less time together?

226
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,770
Absolutely, Chela.

227
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,241
Well, I have to say, this is a big relief.

228
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,082
In all candor, I was feeling the same,

229
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,370
but I thought that discussing it with you
might be awkward.

230
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,324
Not at all.

231
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:06,806
You are ready, Chela, to stand on your own,
to weather the challenges of the future.

232
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,126
And the rumors swirling
about your leadership.

233
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,406
Be well, Gavin.

234
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,642
I'm sorry. Wait, what...

235
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,051
What rumors?

236
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,885
There is talk that
in the face of a growing threat

237
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,681
from Richard Hendricks and Pied Piper,
armed with a powerful new CEO,

238
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,444
that you have done nothing.

239
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,646
- Well, yes, but...
- And that by shuttering Nucleus,

240
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,530
you have left them
to gather strength unopposed,

241
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,250
ceding the entire space.

242
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,244
Some are saying
this is a show of great weakness.

243
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,966
Who? Who exactly is saying this?

244
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,090
Well, people talk.

245
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,329
In the halls, in the cafeteria,
on the parking shuttle.

246
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,165
Wait, should I be worried about this?

247
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:57,208
The beauty is, now you have all the answers.

248
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,007
Yes?

249
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,760
All right.

250
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,325
Denpok, please.

251
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,688
Will you sit back down?

252
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,205
I need your help.

253
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,566
Of course.

254
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,006
Thank you.

255
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,687
Clearly, we have come far,
but we still have far to go.

256
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,483
Not as far as lot D,

257
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,410
but far nonetheless.

258
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,251
Look what you guys built.

259
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,526
You can't help but be elegant.

260
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,648
You're like Audrey Hepburn.

261
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,801
Here they come.

262
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,042
Well, I know we made a big deal

263
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,363
about just doing your
absolute minimum of your specs,

264
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,011
but one thing led to another and, well, Jack,

265
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,163
buckle your seat belt
because I'd like to introduce you to...

266
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,242
Richard, just save it.

267
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,401
Just got off the phone with
Calvin Greene, CEO of Maleant.

268
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,649
- They're pulling out.
- What?

269
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,006
How can they just pull out?

270
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,161
Because they shopped our deal

271
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,288
and got a better bid
from another appliance maker,

272
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,607
so Maleant's out, they fucked us.

273
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,000
- Oh.
- Yeah.

274
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,882
So, probably we should just push pause
on the whole box thing

275
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,328
until we figure out where to go from here.

276
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,166
Okay. I... Actually, I have a question.

277
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,210
Yeah, I know. I know.
I know, Richard, we had an arrangement,

278
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,806
but that was all based on
closing the Maleant deal.

279
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,161
- So now we have to figure out...
- No, no, no. Sorry.

280
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,288
No, my question is, who did they go with?

281
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,840
Whose box do they think
is that much better than ours?

282
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,088
Oh, uh, Dectosphere.

283
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,286
Dectosphere?

284
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,124
It's a brick with a power cord.

285
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,405
Yeah. But I hear their new 43-11 s,

286
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,649
they're going to be hitting
close to 75 megs per second.

287
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,962
Uh, we can do 200.

288
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,325
- What?
- Yeah.

289
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,880
Do you think you can get me in a room
with Calvin Greene?

290
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,961
This is the pool.

291
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,646
The first night I was here,
I turned the heat, like, all the way up,

292
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,722
and half the water evaporated overnight.

293
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,847
It's crazy.

294
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,967
Well, I hope you own a skimmer

295
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,801
because there's a massive turd
floating on the surface of your pool.

296
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,881
Who, Fred? Fred's great, man.

297
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,089
He's got this really cool,
um, malware cataloging thing...

298
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,241
Cut the shit, Big Head.

299
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,924
I see exactly what you're doing.

300
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,206
Poaching my tenants?

301
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,009
You stole my business model.

302
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,329
What? No. Dude, it's not like that at all.

303
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,085
It's just, this house has, like, nine bedrooms.

304
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,810
You have any idea
how scary that gets at night?

305
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,009
So I just wanted
to have some roommates around,

306
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,287
but, you know, I felt weird charging them rent,

307
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,243
-'cause, you know.
- No, I don't.

308
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,842
Well, it's, like, 20 million, you know?
So I don't really need it,

309
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:32,447
but then they felt weird
living here without paying me anything,

310
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,046
so they offered me pieces of their start-ups.
That's all.

311
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,802
You just admitted to starting
a competing incubator.

312
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,727
I've caught you in a web
of your own lies, haven't I?

313
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,761
I don't think so. Wait, have you?

314
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,609
All right, Big Head.
You want to play it that way?

315
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,445
If it's a fight you want,
then a fight you shall have.

316
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,760
All of you!

317
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,565
See you, buddy.

318
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,360
Big Head.

319
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,247
We'll see.

320
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,611
Fuck!

321
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,966
What are we doing here?

322
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,929
Why are we fighting like this?

323
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,044
I mean, I'm gonna steal your guys,
you're gonna steal my guys.

324
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,930
We'll both wield the heft
of our considerable fortunes

325
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,287
until each of us have nearly nothing left.

326
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,601
Is that really what you want? Me either.

327
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,363
So what do you say we join forces?

328
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,851
I'm big enough.

329
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,042
Are you, Big Head?

330
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,081
Partners?

331
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,921
Okay.

332
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,241
Atta boy.

333
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,607
All right, I'm going to take a spin
on that fancy Japanese toilet,

334
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,091
and then let's get to work

335
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,528
figuring out which one of these bedrooms
is gonna be my office.

336
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,729
Consider the bulldog.

337
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,005
A grotesque monstrosity
born of relentless inbreeding.

338
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,602
Riddled with sinusitis, crippled by joint pain,

339
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,401
chronically flatulent.

340
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,286
A kindly pet, or humanity's cruelest mistake?

341
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,610
All right, take it away.

342
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,168
Ladies and gentlemen,
just like that horrible creature,

343
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,608
the entire Nucleus program
was the result of inbreeding.

344
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:26,163
We mated Hooli engineers
with Hooli designers in a Hooli kennel.

345
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,450
Is it any wonder the result was
just as unspeakable as that thing?

346
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,126
Bring it back here!

347
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,521
Look at that hideous face.

348
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,809
All right, get it out of here!

349
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,402
I'm sorry, Gavin. What's your point?

350
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,246
My point is, just as not all dogs
are as flawed as the bulldog,

351
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,006
not all compression plays
are as flawed as Nucleus.

352
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,562
Our execution was lacking,
but the idea was correct.

353
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,847
Our only mistake was looking inward.

354
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,809
It is now time to look outward.

355
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,890
I mean, this guy did all of the work.

356
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,201
Ten minutes after we leave
Calvin Greene's office,

357
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,170
he calls me up and says,
"Hey, you got me. How much?"

358
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,401
I just showed them the box,

359
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,369
Jack's the one who made the deal.

360
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,083
Good feelings, happy feelings.

361
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:21,686
So, Big Head built a better version
of your incubator, accidentally.

362
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,091
Correct.

363
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,650
And he didn't even realize it?

364
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,131
Also correct.

365
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,602
And your solution to that was
to go into business with him?

366
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,727
Big Head?

367
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:35,044
The guy you once called more useless
than a bag of dicks without a handle?

368
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,090
Dinesh, don't fall for his "aw, shucks" routine.

369
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,083
He is a shrewd businessman.

370
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:46,566
And together, we have over
$20,036,000 at our disposal.

371
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,171
Now, if you'll excuse me, on to Pied Piper.

372
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:56,090
I have a board meeting,
and this board ain't exactly gonna meet itself.

373
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:01,366
Our subsequent order of business
is the approval of Pied Piper's redraft

374
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,411
of the hardware requisition agreement
with Maleant Data Systems Solutions.

375
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,766
Oh, yeah.

376
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,410
The main event.

377
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,326
We've all read
the latest sales agreement, yes?

378
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,368
Actually, I don't think I was CC'd on...

379
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,568
So, I believe
we can move straight forward to a vote?

380
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,801
Actually, I'm sorry.

381
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,089
I have an issue with, uh, section 14,
paragraph two.

382
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,447
Um, it states that Maleant has exclusive rights
to purchase any appliance made by Pied Piper

383
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,164
for the next five years.

384
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,527
Oh, uh, yeah.
Jack gave them exclusive rights to the box

385
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,284
so that we would get a better price upfront.

386
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,482
Right, but this language is far broader.

387
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:38,406
They actually have exclusive rights
to use the underlying algorithm in any form.

388
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,891
Oh, no. That's not right at all.

389
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,286
Yeah, so I think, Jack,

390
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,125
we're going to have to go back to them
and just change the language here.

391
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,926
We're not going to be able to do that.

392
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,168
And, uh, why not?

393
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,484
Because that was the specific language
which Maleant requested

394
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:00,770
when I got them to pay three times as much
for each one of our boxes.

395
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:06,085
It's a white label deal, so they have the right
to resell these boxes in any form they choose.

396
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,209
Yeah, but, Jack,
if they have exclusive rights to the algorithm,

397
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,124
then we can't use the algorithm
to build the platform.

398
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,531
For five years.

399
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,443
They wanted seven, I talked them down.

400
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,760
I know, but you said that we could

401
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,365
build the platform once we gave you the box.

402
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,411
Yes, but I never specified a time frame.

403
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,811
Are you serious?

404
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,721
I save your ass
and you stab me in the back like this?

405
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,767
In the front, Richard.

406
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,205
Laurie, did you know about this?

407
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,122
- I did not.
- Well, then, good, okay.

408
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,010
So it won't go through
because Laurie's not going to vote for it.

409
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:38,927
Richard, this is complicated.

410
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,727
If one goes strictly
by the numbers, these numbers,

411
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,725
you have built a box that is so valuable,

412
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,406
I am now obligated to vote in favor of it.

413
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,369
Laurie, this deal is peanuts.

414
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,601
The platform could be worth
1,000 times what the box is worth.

415
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,445
It could be, correct, however...

416
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,410
This is theoretical, Richard.

417
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,130
You don't have a price point, I do,

418
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,562
and she has a fiduciary obligation
as a member of the board

419
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,880
to vote for the box.

420
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,282
On the page, this is in the best interest
of the company.

421
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,407
Am I wrong, Laurie?

422
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,050
That is factually correct.

423
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,049
You remember when you tried to end run me
and kill the box?

424
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,407
Well, she couldn't do
a goddamn thing about it then.

425
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,051
And she can't do
a goddamn thing about it now.

426
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,450
Simple majority ratifies
the agreement, all in favor.

427
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,364
Are you kidding me?
What the fuck is going on right now?

428
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,766
Laurie.

429
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,320
I wasn't carbon copied
on this particular email,

430
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,646
so, I stand with Richard.

431
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,561
Um...

432
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,404
Richard, you know how
I voted to fire you a couple months ago?

433
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,448
And I said that I did it to stay in the game,

434
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,888
so that maybe at some point in the future,
I could do something to help?

435
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,883
Well, Laurie,

436
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,200
I know you'll probably
replace me on the board

437
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,602
and call for a revote tomorrow,
but I'm here today.

438
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,641
And I don't have any metrics to back it up,

439
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,242
but I honestly believe that
the platform that Richard wants to build

440
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,767
will be far more lucrative
in the long term than any box.

441
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:17,688
So, at least for today, I'm voting no.

442
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,451
Motion denied.

443
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,643
We will be reconvening tomorrow.

444
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,931
And if I could get a...
An email, be CC'd on the latest draft...

445
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,888
I couldn't sit there
and watch them do that to you.

446
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,207
I just hope I don't end up fired over this.

447
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,047
Well, what you did took incredible guts.

448
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,607
And the fact that
it probably won't make any difference

449
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,170
makes it all the more meaningful.

450
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,204
Right, I saw this nature documentary

451
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,205
where a bison fought a lion
to protect the rest of the herd.

452
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,964
And it was so moving.

453
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,728
It didn't work, the lion tore into the bison
and then laid waste to the herd,

454
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,689
but what courage.

455
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,770
Thank you, Jared.

456
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,411
You guys just had to make a great box,
didn't you?

457
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,766
You couldn't phone it in.

458
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,649
Uh, guys, Gavin Belson is calling me. Again.

459
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,166
What the fuck does he want?

460
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,161
Hello?

461
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,921
Richard Hendricks, just checking in,
seeing if you heard the news.

462
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,561
What news?

463
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:29,925
Hmm. Obviously, you don't have your
Hooli news alerts up to date.

464
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,730
Go to the site. I'll wait.

465
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,964
Go to the Hooli news website.

466
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,041
Okay.

467
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,847
It's an ad.

468
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,009
It's an ad. Hold on.

469
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,327
Just wait four seconds
and you can click to skip it.

470
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,842
Just wait four seconds
and then you can click it.

471
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,287
No, it's the kind where you have to watch
the whole fucking thing.

472
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,771
It's the whole ad kind.

473
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,128
I thought we stopped doing those.
God damn it.

474
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,124
<i>Well, regardless, what you'll see
once the paid announcement is over</i>

475
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,768
is that I just closed a $250 million deal

476
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,804
to acquire a little company called EndFrame.

477
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,609
<i>I thought you'd want to know.</i>

478
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,967
<i>Update those Hooli news alerts.</i>

479
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:15,203
Also, I invite you to click "yes"
if our ad experience was relevant to you.

480
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,611
<i>Be well, Richard.</i>

481
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,926
What did he say?

482
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,966
Oh, my God.

483
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,405
"Gavin Belson announces deal
to acquire EndFrame,

484
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,801
"a middle-out compression
platform company,

485
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,691
"for $250 million."

486
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:36,567
Even after they shit the bed with Nucleus,
Hooli gets to build our platform and we don't?

487
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,326
What is funny about this?

488
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,811
He's intoxicated.

489
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,963
No. No... Yes, but don't you see?

490
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,563
Gavin, in trying to fuck us,
just saved our asses.

491
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,411
He's right. He's right.

492
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,047
My gosh. Oh, my gosh, he's right.

493
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,485
Holy shit.

494
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,604
I am so confused right now.

495
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,681
Gavin set a...

496
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,206
He set the...

497
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,964
- The price point.
- Yes!

498
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,771
Yes, yes, yes. Yes, thanks to Gavin,

499
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,525
EndFrame, a middle-out
compression platform,

500
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,171
is objectively worth $250 million.

501
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,366
Wait, okay.

502
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,482
We are a
middle-out compression platform company.

503
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,961
Are we worth $250 million?

504
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,042
There's no way the box
makes us worth a fraction of that.

505
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,690
Laurie couldn't vote for the platform

506
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,001
because she couldn't assign
a dollar value to it.

507
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,128
Well, Gavin has just done that.

508
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,124
He's validated the market,
so there's no reason to revote

509
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,690
We win.

510
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,321
I can't wait to see the look
on that AAR prick's face

511
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,210
when we come in there and gut him like a...

512
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,441
Is he okay?

513
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,885
He's gonna be fine.

514
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,367
Welcome, men and ladies of EndFrame.

515
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,728
Rather than incestuously promoting
the same faces from within,

516
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,247
you represent fresh blood, new ideas.

517
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,607
Everything Nucleus was not.

518
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:05,481
It is my honor to personally
welcome you all to Hooli.

519
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,168
Does he really not remember us?

520
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,562
How long did you work at Hooli?
The last time?

521
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,085
Seven years.

522
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,764
I was here for nine.

523
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,171
He was invited to my wedding.

524
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,163
I hope Jack doesn't cry.

525
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,809
I really hope he does.

526
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,006
Hey, Gloria. Lynn.

527
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,771
Did they both get fired?

528
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,080
I don't...

529
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,289
Laurie. What are you doing here?

530
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,600
Where's Jack?

531
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,286
As you may recall,

532
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:46,001
at our board meeting last night,
Jack said that he would get his way,

533
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,128
and that, in his words,

534
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,921
I, quote, couldn't do
a goddamn thing about it, end quote.

535
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:56,281
Well, in light of recent activities,

536
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:59,045
it appears that
I could do a goddamn thing about it.

537
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,724
And I just did.

538
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,643
Jack Barker has been exited.

539
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,131
Fuck me sideways.

540
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,406
Indeed.

541
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,566
Effective immediately,

542
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:11,201
you are all at liberty to commence work
upon the platform.

543
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,128
Okay. Uh, wow.

544
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,850
Yeah, I just got to ask,

545
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,811
with Jack not being CEO anymore,
am I CEO again?

546
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,927
You are not.

547
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,805
Nor are you, Mr. Bachman.

548
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,724
I'm sorry, if I'm not CEO,
Erlich isn't, Jack isn't,

549
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,802
who is gonna run Pied Piper then?

550
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,246
Officially, and until further notice,

551
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,447
this chair will remain empty.

552
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,122
- What, really?
- Excuse me.
