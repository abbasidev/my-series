1
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,610
Okay, one extra-large virgin margarita.

2
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,807
- Thank you, Richard.
- What took you so long?

3
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,201
Uh, I actually... Uh, I met a girl.

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,323
It's called the bartender, she works here.

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,890
No, no. It's a real girl.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,968
And I actually got her real phone number.

7
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,647
Check you out, Mr. Casanova.

8
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,131
Where is this individual?

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,206
Um, she's right over there.

10
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,805
The tall dude?

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,326
No, behind him.

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,051
Oh, she must be hiding behind
that attractive girl in the red sweater.

13
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,600
No, it is the attractive girl in the red sweater.

14
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,806
- Oh...
- Please stop looking at her.

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,325
She's magnificent.

16
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,765
You sure it's not the tall guy?

17
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,050
Why are we surprised that young Richard
is garnering the attention of ladies?

18
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,890
After all, he's king again.

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,121
Women like that.

20
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,646
Okay, so she's a founder hounder.

21
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,722
Come on, no, it's not like that.

22
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,246
But you did tell her that you're the CEO
of your own company?

23
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,446
it came up.

24
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,081
But I mean, honestly, how else was I going to
explain that me and my friends were at a bar?

25
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,207
That is a good point.

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,363
Anytime you're near a woman,
it is important to explain why.

27
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,568
Otherwise, they get nervous.

28
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:17,246
Gentlemen, to Pied Piper's past,
and now present, CEO.

29
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,560
Oh, what about future?

30
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,247
Jared, we'll worry about that later.

31
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,163
Tonight is about Richard.

32
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,845
To Richard.

33
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,201
I think you'll find I'm a pretty tolerant boss,

34
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,887
but, Gleb, your last commit,
you did use spaces over tabs.

35
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,811
Um, I don't know why you'd commit to that.

36
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,168
Uh, so, just tell me why on Earth
you would do something like that.

37
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,130
<i>Is not so big a deal.
They're very much the same. Yes?</i>

38
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,248
<i>Yes, yes, he's right.
They're very much the same.</i>

39
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,970
No, no, sorry, they're not the same.

40
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,929
At least not in my book. Um, um...

41
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,522
One is right, and the other is wrong.

42
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,961
Why didn't anyone tell Gleb to use tabs?

43
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,361
Yeah, we did.
And it's in the company style guide.

44
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,809
I just don't think Gleb realized
how seriously Richard takes this stuff.

45
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,928
Yeah, I've honestly never
understood it myself.

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,924
I mean, once the code
goes through the compiler,

47
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,331
there's effectively no difference.

48
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,131
I know, but coders go, like, batshit over it.

49
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,928
At Hooli, I once saw two engineers
get into a fight so vicious,

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,445
they almost made physical contact.

51
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,487
What?

52
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,324
Okay, guys, back to work.

53
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,644
Uh, Gleb, Sanjay, everyone,
do you understand tabs?

54
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,485
<i>Yes, yes. You have made this very clear.
As clear as crystal.</i>

55
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,527
Okay.

56
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,365
Good, that's my little thing,
and I'll hand you back to Dinesh now.

57
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,401
He's the man with the plan,
and the pretty cool tan.

58
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,208
-it's not a tan, it's...
- Yeah, I know, I know.

59
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,009
Uh, sorry.

60
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,366
This is how I was born.

61
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,006
Hey, Elisabet. Hi.

62
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,923
Um, before you go, I just wanted to say that

63
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,607
I thought your last commit
was very impressive.

64
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,850
<i>Oh, thank you.</i>

65
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,526
Almost as nice as the fingers that typed it.

66
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,361
- Just call it like I see it.
<i>- Thank</i> you.

67
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,083
Speaking of seeing, I will see you tomorrow.

68
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,170
<i>Yes, you Will.</i>

69
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,851
<i>Bye-bye, Dinesh.</i>

70
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,081
Bye, Elisabet.

71
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,361
Yuck.

72
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,720
What?

73
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,729
You don't actually think she was flirting,
do you?

74
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,685
She works here.
She's paid to interact with you.

75
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,331
Just like that bartender
that Richard thought he was flirting with.

76
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,647
Uh, actually, she's not a bartender.

77
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,927
And for your information,
we've been trading texts.

78
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,571
And we're going for drinks later, so...

79
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,320
Great.

80
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,406
If you go to the bar she works at,
you can probably drink for free.

81
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,801
Again, uh, not a bartender.

82
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,845
Okay? She works at Facebook.

83
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,888
So she makes a lot more money
than I do or you do.

84
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,889
And she's definitely not a founder hounder.

85
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,490
So, sorry.

86
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,010
Yeah, none of that adds up.

87
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,082
Hey, guys, check out Code/Rag.

88
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,571
What, did the Gavin piece post?

89
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,085
Indeed it did.

90
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,321
Oh.

91
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,165
"Gavin Belson's Hooli-Scrub Scandal."
Awesome.

92
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,284
Man, Gavin cannot be happy about this.

93
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,561
Stay close.

94
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,246
Back up, back up.

95
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,890
You're on private property.
Back to the sidewalk.

96
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,927
You're gonna get arrested.

97
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,001
Hey, Gavin!

98
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,565
Hello, I'm...

99
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,010
You know, a hundred years ago,

100
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,686
men like me could've
had people like that killed.

101
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,565
Just like that.

102
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,486
You think captains of industry
like Andrew Carnegie or Cornelius Vanderbilt

103
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,166
would've batted an eyelid? Please.

104
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,088
Times sure have changed.

105
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,761
Or have they?

106
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,561
Of course they have.

107
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,930
And for the better.

108
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,726
Unless...

109
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,801
All right, forget it.

110
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,961
What are we doing about this article?

111
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,247
Can we sue this Cantwell woman for libel?

112
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,166
Gavin, libel laws don't really apply
when what's written is true.

113
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,164
It's my understanding you did in fact
instruct Nucleus engineers

114
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,561
-to obscure negative Hooli search...
- I know what I did.

115
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,247
Forget libel. What about this unnamed
Hooli insider she keeps quoting?

116
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,723
Everything this person is saying is obviously
covered by a nondisclosure agreement.

117
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,245
Let's sue that person.

118
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,448
We don't know who that person is.

119
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,723
And reporters generally
don't give up their sources.

120
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,531
Well, then I'll just have to light a fire
under this reporter's ass, won't I?

121
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:40,922
You know, there was a time, not so long ago,
when it could've been a literal fire.

122
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,571
But, as discussed, those days are gone.

123
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,926
Unless...

124
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,761
All right, forget it.

125
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,323
You people are useless. Thank you.
You're excused.

126
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,965
It's Gavin Belson for C.J. Cantwell, please.
She'll know what it's regarding.

127
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,886
Now, the stage should be here.

128
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,647
With Yeezy or someone comparable.

129
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,803
Now, I have yet to land on a theme.

130
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:22,488
Most people who rent Alcatraz for parties
tend to go with the prison theme.

131
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,090
How much would it cost to make this look
as if it were never a prison at all?

132
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,811
Spare no expense.

133
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,882
And if you think it would be cool,

134
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,442
I would love to have
some sort of chocolate moat here,

135
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,605
with little boats floating down it filled
with graham crackers and marshmallows.

136
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,569
It's been a childhood dream of mine.

137
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,166
And get the best chocolatier.
We want to impress.

138
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,490
I'm inviting every asshole
from the Valley to attend.

139
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,241
- You're inviting assholes?
- Absolutely.

140
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,049
Assholes, shit dongles.

141
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,603
Any foe or enemy I've made
over my storied career will be here.

142
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,163
That way, when I take the stage
and unleash the power of Bachmanity,

143
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,842
they'll all be in the front row.

144
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,331
Erlich, uh, can we talk for a second?

145
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,081
What is it, Big Head?

146
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,804
I thought I told you to go
watch something on your iPad.

147
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,405
I think we may have a problem.

148
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,448
That Code/Rag reporter I talked to

149
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,330
says that Gavin Belson
is threatening to sue her

150
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,084
if she doesn't tell him who she spoke to.

151
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,166
- So?
- So, she spoke to me.

152
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,403
No publicity is bad publicity.
This might be great timing.

153
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,484
Exactly the reason that we are partners.

154
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,645
Okay, yeah, except if Gavin finds out
it was me that talked to the reporter,

155
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,802
then he'll know I violated my NDA.

156
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,362
And then he could come after
my entire settlement if that happens.

157
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,646
All two million.

158
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,563
I mean, 20 million.

159
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,846
Big Head, I'm not going to yell.

160
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,770
And I'm not going to hit you.

161
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,043
I'm just gonna ask you nicely,

162
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,805
why in the holy fuck didn't you tell me
you signed an NDA,

163
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,724
you sweet, helpless little piece of shit?

164
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,484
Well, that's the thing about the NDA,

165
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,723
is that the NDA is actually covered
under the NDA.

166
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,247
So if I told you about the NDA,
it would've been a violation of the NDA.

167
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,244
And what about speaking with the reporter?
What would that be?

168
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,083
Yeah. Shit.

169
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,967
So, what do you think I should do?

170
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,690
- I could call her back and...
- No.

171
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,650
Let me handle it.
You go wait in the helicopter.

172
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,767
- Okay.
- Go.

173
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,763
Sasha, I'm going to need to go back
to the mainland.

174
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,841
Oh, is there a problem?

175
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,605
Oh, no, no, no. Full steam ahead.

176
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,284
Mainland.

177
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,610
This is an island.

178
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,283
That's the theme.

179
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,725
Hawaiian.

180
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,404
We'll have a luau.

181
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,208
Yeah, somebody
called me that in high school,

182
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,884
and the nickname just stuck.

183
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,930
<i>Pakistani Denzel?</i>

184
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,721
I mean, I don't see it.
But everybody else does. So...

185
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,727
<i>Maybe they should call him American Dinesh?</i>

186
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,370
Stop.

187
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,124
<i>Only if you stop first.</i>

188
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,929
- No, you stop first.
- You <i>stop first.</i>

189
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,809
<i>- You go first.
- No, I think you should.</i>

190
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,121
Okay, I'll stop. Bye.

191
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,846
What's your end game here?

192
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,490
You think after your tired rap,

193
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,484
she's going to hop on a plane,
fly halfway across the world,

194
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,407
and fuck you?

195
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,005
My motivations are pure.

196
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,568
Her and I have, like, a real connection.

197
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,530
She's so, like, nice
and she's so down-to-Earth,

198
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,525
that it's like she has no idea
how attractive she is.

199
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,608
You don't know how attractive she is.

200
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,729
Packet loss over Estonian broadband
is terrible.

201
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,001
She could be hideous.

202
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,163
Well, I can't imagine that would matter
to Dinesh one iota.

203
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,841
Right.

204
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,005
'Cause she's nice and very talented
and has a great laugh.

205
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,048
And with any luck, she's not a dogface.

206
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,610
How was your date with Winnie?

207
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,966
Uh, well, pretty good,
considering she's still in the other room.

208
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,168
Baller, you got lucky on the first date.

209
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,568
Yeah, did a little bit, not everything.

210
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,449
I mean, I slept in my jeans.

211
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,842
Well, take your time. Hunger is the best sauce.

212
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,570
You're right. Uh...

213
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,769
We did a little bit of under the shirts
and light finger banging.

214
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,560
Oh, hey.

215
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,604
- Hey, I'm Winnie.
- Oh.

216
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,960
Hi, I'm Dinesh.

217
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,405
Hi, I'm Jared.

218
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,251
- It is an honor to meet you.
- Okay.

219
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,926
God, what a pleasure.

220
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,361
Thanks.

221
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,046
I'm Gilfoyle.

222
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,246
Are you a bartender?

223
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,050
I work at Facebook.

224
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,606
As a bartender?

225
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,603
I had a stuffed animal named Winnie.

226
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,681
Oh, wow.

227
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,921
I mean,
it wasn't technically an animal,

228
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,209
I took a Ziploc bag
and I stuffed it with old newspaper,

229
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,805
and then I drew a smile on it.

230
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,167
Okay, well, shall we have some coffee,
milady?

231
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,481
- Sure. Let's do it.
- Okay. All right.

232
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,241
We're already on to Elizabethan nicknames.

233
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,090
This is serious.

234
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,164
They'll be Ren Faire-ing soon.

235
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,287
It's healthy.

236
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,406
And now that Richard's dating, in solidarity,
I think I might get back out there myself.

237
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,201
You make it sound like
you've chosen not to date.

238
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,011
Yeah, absolutely.
I wanted to focus on Pied Piper.

239
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:11,324
But, yeah, maybe now I'll fan
out my plumage, so to speak,

240
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,523
and see what pretty birdies
might share my nest.

241
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,050
Hey, Jared, if you fuck any pretty birdies
in my server room,

242
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,884
put a tie on the doorknob, won't you?

243
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,167
As a signal. Yeah, good thinking.

244
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,931
Okay, so I'll just get the car keys,
and then give you a lift home.

245
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,126
Okay, milady?

246
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,169
- Milord.
- Oh, milady.

247
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,121
Okay.

248
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,330
So, Richard tells me you guys are building
deep nets into your platform?

249
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,606
Oh, really?

250
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,206
What other company secrets
did he blab to you?

251
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,443
Well, I'm a bartender. I wouldn’t understand
all the science-y talk, right?

252
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,641
Touché.

253
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,007
So you do AI at Facebook?

254
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:52,051
No, but when I was at MIT,
I did my master's thesis on game-playing AIs.

255
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,690
I did a lot of machine learning stuff.

256
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,444
For gaming? How does that work?

257
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,521
It's on my GitHub.

258
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,840
Do you want to check it out?

259
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,889
Gavin said he was gonna haul me into court,

260
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,726
and have a judge compel me
to give up my source or go to jail.

261
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,404
Okay? I am not going to jail.

262
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,887
No, no one's going to jail, C.J.

263
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,521
Although, if you did,
going to jail for protecting your source

264
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,285
would make you some kind of
First Amendment hero.

265
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,567
It's pretty much the best thing
that can happen to a journalist.

266
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,404
Journalist? I'm a tech blogger, okay?

267
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,562
I write stories for the Internet
about the Internet.

268
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,483
I am not going to jail for that.

269
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,325
I know it is an inconsequential shit job.

270
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,764
It doesn't really contribute to culture
in any way whatsoever.

271
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,083
We've established
that you don't have any journalistic integrity,

272
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,371
but what would it cost to buy you some?

273
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,886
...and then I figured out a way

274
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,884
to train a convolutional net
to play Atari 2600 games.

275
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,689
- Uh-oh.
- What?

276
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,246
Spaces.

277
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,722
Yeah, so what, you guys use tabs?

278
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,564
In this house, yes.

279
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:58,043
Richard is a bit of a zealot
in the Tabs V. Spaces holy war.

280
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,969
I get that, for his company. Sure.

281
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,883
This goes much deeper.

282
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,089
I think he believes that people
who use spaces are less than.

283
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,248
- Huh...
- I wouldn't mention this to Richard.

284
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,925
You don't want to see him throw a hissy fit.

285
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,207
Okay. Shall we away, milady?

286
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,646
Nice to meet you guys.

287
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,051
Have fun.

288
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,522
- Bye.
- Bye.

289
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,202
I actually kind of liked her.

290
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,731
Too bad Richard's going to fuck it up.

291
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,931
So, you moved the swimming pool?

292
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,644
Yeah, it just felt like it was way too far
from the house, like, crazy far.

293
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,485
So I had this company come
and just move it closer.

294
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,007
Uh-huh. But then you moved it back?

295
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,490
Yeah, turns out the guy who built this place
knew exactly what he was doing,

296
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:45,326
and the pool was right where it needed to be
the whole time.

297
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,165
But now I know that for sure,
which feels good.

298
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,846
Nelson, do you like being wealthy?

299
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,570
Yeah, oh, man, it's awesome.

300
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,165
So you want to stay wealthy?

301
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,527
- Okay, yeah, sure.
- Great.

302
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,841
Here are the three things
you need to do, all right?

303
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,446
One, stop moving the swimming pool.

304
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,161
Oh, yeah, okay, I can do that. What else?

305
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:08,126
Two, you need to manage your expenses
and track your receipts

306
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,608
a little bit better than this.

307
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,968
I'm only as good as the information I have.

308
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,047
Oh, you're great.

309
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,088
No, I wasn't fishing for compliments.

310
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,569
And three, I sense that people
are taking advantage of you.

311
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,609
Oh, sorry, hold on.

312
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,890
Oh, it's Erlich, I should probably grab this.

313
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,962
Erlich Bachman, a perfect example.

314
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,884
You gave him signing power
on your personal checking account?

315
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,200
Yeah, he's my business partner.

316
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,363
You're not structured as a corporation.
You're a general partnership.

317
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,171
So he's essentially your spouse.

318
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,129
That's very dangerous.

319
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,281
But I trust him.

320
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,324
He's actually trying to save us money
right now, so hold on.

321
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,401
Hey, man.

322
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,448
Big Head, wondrous news.

323
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,729
I eliminated the Gavin problem,
and at the exact same time,

324
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,804
I closed funding
on our first strategic investment.

325
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,730
We bought a blog.

326
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,322
Oh, cool. How much do blogs cost?

327
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,401
What?

328
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,562
Oh, nothing. We practically stole it from them.

329
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,130
What?

330
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,611
I'm bullshitting.

331
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,371
Half a million dollars.

332
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,521
Let me talk to him, please.

333
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:12,486
Uh, hey, hey, Erlich, could you talk to
my business manager for a second?

334
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,006
No, I've got to jet, but tell him
I'll see him at the party.

335
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,286
Good day, partner.

336
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,125
Okay, cool.

337
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,324
About the blog...

338
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,602
- Five hundred grand.
- Oh, God.

339
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,762
I know, we practically stole it, right?

340
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,928
<i>Your roommates are really funny.
I like them.</i>

341
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,604
They gave me a little shit.

342
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,928
Oh, well, you can't take that personally.

343
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,401
Oh, it's fine. They gave you shit, too.

344
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,370
Really? What about, like,
my hair or something?

345
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,490
No. They tried to convince me you were
some sort of formatting Nazi

346
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,040
about tabs versus spaces.

347
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,205
What? Me? A Nazi? That's ridiculous.

348
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,329
That's what I said, I mean, I use spaces.
So what?

349
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,965
Mmm...

350
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,883
Yeah, so what?

351
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,281
See, they said you'd have
a hissy fit if you found out.

352
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,362
Mmm-mmm. Hissy fit. Me? No.

353
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,487
I know.

354
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,324
You know. I know.

355
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,487
I mean, make up your mind, guys,

356
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,801
am I a Nazi or am I
a guy who throws hissy fits, you know?

357
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,121
Am I a Nazi who throws hissy fits?

358
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,521
I hope not. That was Hitler.
That was, like, his whole deal.

359
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,841
I mean, that's pretty insensitive
to the Holocaust, don't you think?

360
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,526
'Cause that's, like, what Hitler did.
You know, he just, like,

361
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,171
killed so many people,
so tragic, such a tragic time.

362
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,527
- Yeah.
- I'm so glad we're not doing that anymore.

363
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,410
I mean, we, like I was, you know...

364
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,921
I want them all to die. I don't. I don't care.

365
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,162
I mean, I do care. Don't kill them.

366
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,526
Them... Jews.

367
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,962
Uh, anyway, what do you want to order here?

368
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,487
Is that our P2P protocol?

369
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,011
Yeah, I'm just hacking for fun.

370
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,811
I figured out a way to use our compression
for RTC, so...

371
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,081
Video chat?

372
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,527
Yeah, I think it could be better resolution
than Hooli-Chat.

373
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,170
Even over 3G.

374
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,891
It could just be, like, a fun, cool feature
in the platform, you know.

375
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:54,602
And then coincidentally you'll finally be able
to see what Elisabet actually looks like.

376
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,843
- Oh, yeah.
- Huh.

377
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,365
I hadn't thought of that.

378
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,010
If you worked half as hard on the platform

379
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,771
as you do trying to ogle
strange Slavic women,

380
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,481
maybe our shares would
finally be worth something.

381
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,801
Hey, uh...

382
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,129
What the hell was that?

383
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,009
Can you give us slightly more, Richard?

384
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:24,371
Why did you tell Winnie that I think people
who use spaces over tabs are stupid?

385
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:25,921
Because you do.

386
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,001
No, I don't.

387
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,605
And if I did, which I don't,

388
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,923
why would you say that
behind my back to her?

389
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,561
I mean, things were just
going so well, until she...

390
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,042
That was completely lovely.

391
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,571
Yeah, it was really nice.

392
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,881
You're really something.
I'll give you a call later, okay?

393
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,406
Okay, cool, yeah. Great, sounds good.

394
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,847
Bye, Jared.

395
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,086
Bye.

396
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,927
Jared?

397
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,361
Yeah?

398
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,886
Who was that?

399
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,964
Oh, that was Carol.

400
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:16,848
So, uh, Jared, did you just have sex with her?

401
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,686
What?

402
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,886
I'm an adult,

403
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,770
and like the rest of you, I'm a sexual being.

404
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,204
You fucked her in the garage?

405
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,569
Well, it's the server room and my bedroom.

406
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,042
What, so you just meet a woman,

407
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,442
and then you have sex with her?

408
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,365
How often does this happen?

409
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:46,442
Well, if you're asking me how many times
I've been in love, the answer is two.

410
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,484
But the rest, I won't talk about.

411
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,085
It's untoward.

412
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,840
Russ was right, this guy fucks.

413
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,124
Who was that gorgeous gazelle
in the driveway?

414
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,607
Well, I've said all I care to, let's move on.

415
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,569
She let Jared have sex with her.

416
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,083
Jared, nice. Using that dick.

417
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,250
Gents,

418
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:14,010
I'd like to invite you to what promises to be
the social event of the season.

419
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,567
Bachmanity Insanity.

420
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,846
Alcatraz?

421
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,082
Don't worry, it will be unrecognizable.

422
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,242
Jared, with regards to the...

423
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,326
You need a plus one?

424
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,524
Oh, no, thank you.
I think it's too early for that.

425
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,601
Good idea.

426
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,331
Don't bring sand to the beach,
there's already pussy there.

427
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,126
Richard, I assume you'll be taking
your woman friend?

428
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,885
You know what? Yes.

429
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,201
She and I will be there together.

430
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,361
I'm going to make this work,

431
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:46,570
despite all your little attempts
to sabotage my relationship.

432
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,325
You can do anything
you put your mind to, Richard.

433
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,483
Including turning Alcatraz into Hawaii.

434
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,926
You Okay?

435
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,568
Yeah. Yeah, all good. Great.

436
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,850
- You know...
- What?

437
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,442
My roommate's going out of town tomorrow,

438
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,524
so if we want to come back here
after Erlich's party...

439
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,685
Oh. Okay, yeah.
Sure, that sounds good to me.

440
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,250
All right, it's a date.

441
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,084
See you then.

442
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,766
Richard, what's wrong?

443
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,844
Nothing. Nothing. Literally, it's all good.

444
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,366
Come on.

445
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,771
- Oh, my God!
- I'm sorry.

446
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,330
Your roommates were right,
you really hate spaces.

447
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,771
No,no,no.

448
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,889
I don't... It's not hate.
Hate's a strong word. Um...

449
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,964
Truth be told,
I do have a slight preference for tabs.

450
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:07,206
But that's only because I'm anal
and because I prefer precision.

451
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,410
Well, not to pick a fight here,

452
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:15,041
but if you really care about precision,
wouldn't you use spaces?

453
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,285
- N...
- But whatever.

454
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,442
Once it goes through the compiler,
it's the same thing, right?

455
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,881
Yeah. Yeah, technically, yes.

456
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,126
I guess I just don't understand why you...

457
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,850
Anyone would use spaces over tabs.

458
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,969
Like, if it's all the same,
why not just use tabs?

459
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,486
Because it could look different
on other people's computers.

460
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,847
Tabs create smaller file sizes, all right?

461
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,001
I run a compression company.

462
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,970
Trust me, I've devoted my life
to minimalizing file sizes.

463
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,371
It's what I do.

464
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,490
I mean, I do not get why anyone would use
spaces over tabs.

465
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,325
I mean, why not just use Vim over Emacs?

466
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,925
I do use Vim over Emac.

467
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,280
Oh, God, help us!

468
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,566
Okay. Uh...

469
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,081
You know what?

470
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,447
I just... I don't think this is going to work.
I'm so sorry.

471
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,487
I mean, like, what?

472
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,211
We're going to bring kids into this world
with that over their heads?

473
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,645
That's not really fair to them, don't you think?

474
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,762
Kids? We haven't even slept together.

475
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,251
And guess what,
it's never going to happen now,

476
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,042
because there is no way I'm going to be
with someone who uses spaces over tabs.

477
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,331
Richard.

478
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,563
Wow, okay.

479
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,801
Good bye.

480
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,167
One tab saves you eight spaces.

481
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,401
on!

482
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,161
Oh, my God!

483
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,805
Richard, what happened?

484
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,009
I just tried to go down the stairs
eight steps at a time.

485
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,171
I'm okay, though.

486
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,126
See you around, Richard.

487
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,201
Just making a point.

488
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,801
Huh.

489
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,569
This new video chat protocol
is making your image crystal clear.

490
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,961
<i>Wait one second, Dinesh.</i>

491
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,727
<i>Uh, Dinesh, I can't see you, it's all black.</i>

492
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:13,488
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't give the camera
permission to access the video chat, hold on.

493
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,244
Boom!

494
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,130
<i>Yes, I can see you now.</i>

495
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,247
It's me!

496
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,163
Pakistani Denzel!

497
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,161
<i>Yes.</i>

498
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,084
<i>The Denzel who is from Pakistan.</i>

499
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,369
This video quality is great, right?
Looks so sharp.

500
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,524
That's what we do here at Pied Piper.

501
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,529
<i>It's very impressive.</i>

502
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:42,845
<i>Um, I will have to tell
my boyfriend all about it.</i>

503
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,207
Boyfriend?

504
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,609
You never mentioned a boyfriend.

505
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,125
Oh, no? Um...

506
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,531
<i>This is because he's now just husband.</i>

507
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,049
<i>Um, I keep forgetting to say this, husband,</i>

508
00:23:55,160 --> 00:24:00,963
<i>but it is very good to see you this way,
and we will talk more tomorrow.</i>

509
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,084
Yeah, we'll talk...

510
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,880
Either she froze time,

511
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,529
met and married the man of her dreams,

512
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,731
unfroze time, and hopped back
on to vid chat with you,

513
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,322
or you're the dogface.

514
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,482
Which do you think it is?

515
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,891
I'm on the fence.

516
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,286
What the fuck is going on?

517
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:32,042
Richard found a girl, you have a girlfriend,
Jared is getting laid with a girl.

518
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,245
Hi, Mom.

519
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,801
Oh, God.

520
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,087
Winnie, Winnie, Winnie, Winnie.

521
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,288
Sweet, sweet Elisabet.

522
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,321
Gentlemen, mahalo for coming.

523
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,923
You must taste the breaded
humuhumunukunukuapua'a,

524
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,727
flown in fresh this a.m.

525
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,690
What is mumu...

526
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,321
It's breaded.

527
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,367
Get ready.

528
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:27,321
In T-minus five minutes,
Big Head and I are going to take that stage,

529
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,166
and I am going to
ejaculate my success all over

530
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,084
the faces and hair of my fiercest rivals.

531
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:38,569
Like some sort of vengeful
viscous web of payback.

532
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,410
- Erlich?
- Yes.

533
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,481
One moment.

534
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,570
- Sasha, you are doing an exceptional job.
- Oh.

535
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,565
I mean, I see no evidence
that we are not in Hawaii.

536
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,041
Hmm. We have a problem.

537
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,488
Just, several of our vendors are saying
that your checks have bounced.

538
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,721
Uh, Sasha, <i>hikiki'i.</i> I'll be back.

539
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,931
Big Head, Big Head.

540
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,246
Why are our checks bouncing?

541
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,402
If you had responded
to any of my phone calls,

542
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,323
I would've explained it to you.

543
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,765
And who the fuck are you?

544
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:15,050
Uh, Erlich,
this is my business manager, Arthur...

545
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,567
Klaiman.

546
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,369
Klaiman. I knew it was something with Clay.

547
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,802
As I was explaining to Mr. Bighetti,

548
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,680
I've finally managed to get a handle
on his finances.

549
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,684
Our finances. Continue.

550
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,685
After your considerable outlay on lifestyle,

551
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,124
this party and half a million dollars
on a website,

552
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,761
you're functionally insolvent.

553
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,884
Big Head, you're broke?

554
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,360
We're broke, dude.

555
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,601
Erlich, it's time.

556
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:48,082
You have my number.
I left it on your voice mail.

557
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,250
Several times.

558
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,964
<i>Titans of the tech world,
I give you Nelson Bighetti, Erlich Bachman</i>

559
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:58,806
<i>and Bachmanity!</i>

560
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:16,447
<i>- Aloha.
- Uh, that means hello.</i>

561
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,767
<i>Oh, and goodbye.</i>
