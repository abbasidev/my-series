1
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,766
From <i>Bloomberg West</i> in San Francisco,
I'm Emily Chang.

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,527
General Keith Alexander is here
to tackle tech's role in counter-terrorism,

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,365
but first, a quick glimpse
with Richard Hendricks,

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,201
founder and CEO of the hot, new
compression platform Pied Piper,

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,851
and Erlich Bachman, Chief Visionary.

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,285
Oh, Emily Chang, it is just splendid
to be here with you at historical Pier 3,

7
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,691
with a breathtaking view

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,609
of the Embarcadero Center

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,364
and the flag of San Francisco.

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,601
Now, Richard...

11
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,088
Richard actually
developed this technology in my incubator.

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,730
I am listed...

13
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,806
I was originally listed under the white pages
as "Erlich Blachman", with an

14
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,564
a typo that apparently couldn't be changed,

15
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,211
and then Google indexed it,
so I've been dealing with that.

16
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,250
Richard, Pied Piper has taken off like a rocket.

17
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,369
More than 100,000 installs
in just 10 days.

18
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,487
Is that right?

19
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,766
Uh... Uh, yes.

20
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,887
Pretty amazing.

21
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,851
And you have a last-minute invite
to the Vanity Fair summit dinner tonight.

22
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,962
Quite an honor for such a young company.

23
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,565
Richard, maybe
you could comment on this one?

24
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,087
Yeah, we are finally the belles of the balls.

25
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,166
I mean, uh, ball.

26
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,248
Now, some people are
calling you the next Unicorn.

27
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,004
Have you guys thought about that?

28
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,481
You could have a billion-dollar company.

29
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,531
Erlich, you could own 5% of $1 billion.

30
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,920
Uh, ten, actually.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,001
<i>Richard, this is boring.</i>

32
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,241
- Shit.
- No, no, no.

33
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,930
<i>He was an early investor.</i>

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,287
<i>Again, it's Erlich Bachman.</i>

35
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,648
<i>If you Google that, it'll say,
"Did you mean Erlich Blachman?"</i>

36
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,884
<i>You can click on that link, it'll give you
the correct results for Erlich Bachman.</i>

37
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,364
<i>Should we take some calls?</i>

38
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,441
<i>We don't do that here.</i>

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,604
I just know what I saw, Richard.

40
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,321
No, come on. Look, she's married,
she just had another baby.

41
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,802
If you pushed a little harder,
you could have scored right there on camera.

42
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,644
- You should get her phone number.
- Shut up.

43
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,967
Oh. This is actually,
uh, Jian-Yang pranking me.

44
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,041
I should take it.

45
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,966
Yes, of course I have frog's legs.
Why do you ask?

46
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,011
Are you serious? Have you honestly still
not told him that you sold your shares?

47
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,684
You can't keep lying to him like this.

48
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,364
It's not technically a lie.

49
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,807
My shares don't transfer to Raviga
until the next board meeting.

50
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,281
- Come on, it's been 10 days.
- I know, I know.

51
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,967
But, you know, the TechCrunch thing came up
and then there was the Reddit AMA

52
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,327
and, you know, now this Bloomberg thing.

53
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,811
And besides, let's be honest,

54
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,685
Richard shouldn't be in the public eye
without me along to help.

55
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,007
Did you just see the skeeved-out look
on Emily Chang's face?

56
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,525
I thought she was going to walk off set.

57
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,409
Erlich, you're lying to him,

58
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,290
and you made me a part of it,
so now I'm lying to him, too.

59
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,328
The longer you wait,
the worse this is gonna get.

60
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,687
- All right, fine, fine. I'll tell him.
- When?

61
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,525
After the Vanity Fair thing tonight.
I mean, did you see the guest list?

62
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,011
Monica, throw me a bone here.

63
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,447
Twenty-four hours, then I'm telling him.

64
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,443
- Fine, I'll tell him. I'll tell Richard.
- I'm serious.

65
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,601
- Tell me what?
- I'm not joking...

66
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,681
Um...

67
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,691
it was, uh, Jian-Yang.

68
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,240
He said to tell you that
Phillip McCrevis left word.

69
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,607
Oh. Who's Phillip... Oh.

70
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,926
Richard, we'd better get our asses
in first fucking gear

71
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,004
if we want to make it
to this Verge photoshoot.

72
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,889
Oh, shit. That's today?

73
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,645
Yes, I assume that's why you're still
wearing your Bloomberg makeup.

74
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,123
No. No, I was just... I kind of like the way it...

75
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,091
Uh... Can we just
push this to next week, please?

76
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,367
They don't really do that.

77
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,963
Okay, well, can you go?

78
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,451
Please? I just have a ton of work,

79
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,411
and honestly I would be really happy
if I never had to do any of this ever again

80
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,050
and then you were just
the face of the company.

81
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,043
You know what I mean? Oh, shit.

82
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,043
What time is this Vanity Fair thing?

83
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,521
It's tonight. I figure we're wheels up by 6:00,

84
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,604
then we can check into the hotel,
shit, shave, and shit again.

85
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,523
- Get a cocktail.
- What hotel?

86
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,409
Eavesdropping. Well, if you must know,

87
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,563
we got a suite at the Fairmont,
and they're sending a car.

88
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,251
I think Richard deserves it.
And then I figured tomorrow in the a.m.,

89
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,607
we would sleep in and have a nice brunch.

90
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,047
I don't have time for a brunch.
I have to be back here.

91
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,125
Come on, Eggs Benny, a little spinach tartar,
you'll flirt with the waitress.

92
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,841
Killer. And, uh, we'll have a nice talk.

93
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,771
"Talk"? What about?

94
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,049
You know, things, all sorts of themes.

95
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,808
So tomorrow, you, me, brunch,

96
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,282
and, uh, one word. Frittata.

97
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,729
Hey, fellas, is it me, or is it a bit chilly in here?

98
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,286
What in God's name is that?

99
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,840
What do you think it is? It's a jacket!

100
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,441
Now, I only ordered one as a sample,

101
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,171
but once I have your sizes,
we can all have them.

102
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,005
Why would we all want them?
One is already too many.

103
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,560
I don't mean in the house.
I mean, like, in the world.

104
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,645
Now Gilfoyle, I have you at about a 40 long?
Am I right?

105
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,927
If my mother was naked
and dead in the street,

106
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,651
I would not cover her body with that jacket.

107
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,529
<i>GM.</i>

108
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,120
Jared, now that you're here,

109
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,771
-we need two new tables in the game room.
- Yeah?

110
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,401
Okay. Well, maybe against the doors?

111
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,767
Oh, hold on, there's more.

112
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,208
And you guys give me shit
for a tiny gold chain?

113
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,444
I regret nothing. I'm going to get coffee.

114
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,565
Hey, Brownie, you coming?

115
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,529
I was thinking
we'd hit the Philz on Middlefield.

116
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,206
No, let's drive to the one on Forest Avenue.

117
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,123
It's further from that jacket.

118
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,160
Claude, you're on pager duty
until we get back.

119
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,481
Jared, can I borrow that jacket?

120
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,844
I sense you're doing something ironic with it,

121
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,331
but I'm okay with that,

122
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,809
because however unattractive
this jacket may seem to you,

123
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,003
once you slip it on, everything will change.

124
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:08,325
It'll shake out its hair and take off its glasses,
and before you know it, you'll be in love.

125
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,247
Jared, it's really fucking ugly.

126
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,247
Consider the tortoise.

127
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,004
As the fable teaches us,

128
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,208
it may appear that he is losing in his race

129
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,762
against his nemesis,
the insolent and cocksure hare.

130
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,523
But appearances can be deceiving.

131
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,762
Gavin, the tortoise. Is it Endframe?

132
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,844
Yes. But there's more.

133
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,083
- The hare is Pied Piper.
-Indeed it is. Someone's read their Aesop.

134
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,810
We've also read the financials, Gavin.

135
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,325
Between Nucleus and EndFrame,

136
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,051
you've burned through
three-quarters of $1 billion,

137
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,043
with virtually nothing to show for it.

138
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,246
Two weeks ago,

139
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,405
on the heels of powering down the entire
Hooli campus for seemingly no reason,

140
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,927
you lost all of EndFrame's senior engineers.

141
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,049
I grant you, we've stumbled on offense of late,

142
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,122
but the best offense is a good defense.

143
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,601
We've taken a page out of Apple's playbook

144
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,889
and are currently "reviewing"
the Pied Piper app for sale

145
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,601
in our Hooli store
at a pace one might call "tortoise-like."

146
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,284
Don't. They hate that.

147
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,928
In any case, I have it on good authority

148
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,927
that it may be some time before Pied Piper
is available on Hooli OS devices.

149
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,690
We're making it available immediately.

150
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,961
Sorry?

151
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,044
You're fighting a war that's already ended,
Gavin. Pied Piper won.

152
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,043
We called this board meeting to inform you

153
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,329
that it's time for Hooli to let go
and move on without you at the wheel.

154
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,200
I'm sorry, without me?
Are you firing me?

155
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,964
Our intention is simply to transition you

156
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,566
into a more appropriate role
within the company,

157
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,371
one with less oversight
of day-to-day operations.

158
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,801
You're putting me on the fucking roof?

159
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,963
You could always choose to move on, Gavin.
Up to you.

160
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:51,728
I built this company with my bare hands
in my fucking garage.

161
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,609
Where were you when I was doing that?

162
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,801
Gavin?

163
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,240
These animals?

164
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,446
Fuck.

165
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:18,050
Well, uh, you are certainly more than qualified
to be our new head of PR.

166
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,360
Laurie thinks you're great.

167
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,080
Um, to be honest, we could use the help.

168
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,126
All the media stuff has been pretty
overwhelming, especially lately.

169
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,885
- If Marissa Mayer can do it, so can you.
- Oh.

170
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,927
And you're available immediately?

171
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,685
I am. I do have one question for you guys.

172
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,287
Is everything here cool?

173
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,327
Is it cool?

174
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,164
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I mean, I'm cool.

175
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,730
- Yeah, he is cool.
- Uh-huh.

176
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,124
Clearly, but is there anything you guys
want to tell me about the company?

177
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,361
What, like, uh...

178
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,044
All right, look, this is weird,

179
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,726
but when I was in Laurie's office yesterday,

180
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,246
I saw a piece of paper on her desk.

181
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,721
Well, she can be a bit untidy.

182
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,406
It was a sale of a big block
of Pied Piper stock.

183
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,120
Is someone on the inside

184
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,487
-dumping shares right as you're launching?
- What?

185
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,690
No. No, absolutely not.

186
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,683
'Cause that would be
a pretty severe signaling risk.

187
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,205
I mean, you don't have to be in PR

188
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,169
to know that insiders
only dump stock like that

189
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,651
when they know something is wrong.

190
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,247
The bulk of my compensation here
would be options,

191
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,890
and if those aren't
going to be worth anything...

192
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,841
Yeah. No. No, no, no.

193
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,248
That is not happening, okay?
Nothing is going on here.

194
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,846
- Yeah, except excellence.
- Okay.

195
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:37,847
Well, you let me know what you want to do
and I'll think about it.

196
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,004
Okay. Oh.

197
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,522
Um, well, thanks for coming.

198
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,605
What the hell was that?

199
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,526
Maybe it was a negotiating tactic?

200
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,441
Monica.

201
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,961
It's Monica.

202
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,724
Well, let's not jump to conclusions.

203
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,804
I mean, she's the only one
who's bought a jacket.

204
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,929
Jared, she's the only one
who hates the platform.

205
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,601
There's no other explanation for this.
Okay? Monica fucked us.

206
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,122
She pulled down our pants
and fucked us in front of our parents.

207
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,170
Did some...
Richard, did somebody do that to you?

208
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,241
No. No, I don't know why...

209
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,805
Oh, boy, it is chilly.

210
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,808
Good thing I brought this sweet jiz-acket.

211
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,089
Hey, friend? We came here together.

212
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,445
I know what you're doing.

213
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,649
You think you're embarrassing me,

214
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,405
but that's only the secondary effect
of that shitty jacket.

215
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,164
The primary effect is

216
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,804
that you look like a douchebag.

217
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,803
Let me put this in terms you'll understand.

218
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,804
I'm like a suicide bomber of humiliation.

219
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,969
I'm happy to go out
as long as I take you with me.

220
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,408
Your shame is my paradise.

221
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,091
'Sup, ladies?

222
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,289
What you noshing on? Cranberry scone?

223
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:11,241
My friend Dinesh here
has a little crush on you. He's shy.

224
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,080
I don't know him.

225
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,842
Oh, he plays coy.

226
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,410
I don't know why he's so shy.

227
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,801
Excuse me. I noticed your jacket.

228
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,251
Do you work for Pied Piper?

229
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,408
- Yeah.
- Dude, your app is killin' it.

230
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,209
Everyone I know is installing it.

231
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,442
Do you, seriously?
I just downloaded it last night.

232
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,081
- Yeah?
- Do you mind if we get a picture?

233
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,527
- With me?
- Yeah. Everybody get in.

234
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,045
If you want it.

235
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,565
- Thanks.
- Thanks, bro.

236
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,211
Hey, man, did you remember
to put money in the meter?

237
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,760
Hi, I'm Dinesh. l work at Pied Piper.

238
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,490
Excuse me, do I know you?

239
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,089
Gilfoyle.

240
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,561
He's a fuckin' dick, but I love him, though.

241
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,369
You have me confused with someone else.

242
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,651
My name's clearly Jared, and if you
would excuse us, you were interrupting.

243
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,009
No, he's lying. His name is Gilfoyle.
Show them your driver's license.

244
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,448
Jared asked you nicely to step back,
so step the fuck back.

245
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,887
You're being a dick, and you're cutting in line.

246
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,201
You heard him. You're being a dick.

247
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,560
- Boy, some people.
- What a creep.

248
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,369
Sorry you had to deal with that, Jared.

249
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,408
You and me both, friend.

250
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,682
This is Monica.

251
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,282
Is it? Because apparently everything else
that comes out of your mouth is a lie.

252
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,006
Shit.

253
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,482
Look, Richard, I totally understand
if you're pissed at me,

254
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,002
but please know that I tried as hard as I could
to get him to tell you.

255
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,003
Oh, really? Well, that's not what he said.

256
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,082
Oh, really? What exactly did he say?

257
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,403
He said that he found it
on a piece of paper in Laurie's office.

258
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,087
What? Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.
Who's the "he" that you're talking about?

259
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,525
You know who. David.

260
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,161
My brother?

261
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,327
What?

262
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,243
Who the fuck... I don't know.

263
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,288
No, David, the fucking PR guy

264
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,362
who's not going to take a job with us
because of what you did.

265
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,206
Richard, I am totally lost.
What exactly do you think I did?

266
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,566
<i>You can play dumb all you want to.</i>

267
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,325
It won't change the one thing
that both you and I know is true.

268
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,129
You dumped your stock.

269
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,649
What? No. I didn't dump
a single share of my Pied Piper stock.

270
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,529
- I swear.
- Well, then who the fuck did?

271
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,964
And make sure that the money reads.

272
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,122
I mean, Pied Piper is a billion-dollar company.

273
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,440
It's not just a unicorn.

274
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,284
All right, let's do some rearing.

275
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,640
There we go.

276
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,564
Now, let's let the horns
sort of look like my dick.

277
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,451
Perfect.

278
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,485
Are you fucking kidding me?

279
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,721
Richard.

280
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,206
Um, can we take a soft five?

281
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,601
I was going to tell you.
That's what tomorrow's brunch was for.

282
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,446
Brunch? You had 10 fucking days
and you didn't say a thing.

283
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,568
Fine. You want to know why I didn't tell you?

284
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,005
Because it's fucking humiliating.

285
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,241
I'm broke, Richard.

286
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,243
Did you hear me? I'm broke.

287
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,204
Erlich Bachman, the name
that used to be synonymous with success,

288
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,442
went broke and was forced to sell.

289
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,841
- I got royally fucked, Richard.
- You got fucked?

290
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,083
You're the one who threw
a million-dollar party.

291
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,162
- Yeah, but it was a great party.
- No one forced you to do that.

292
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,890
Admit it, you fucked yourself.

293
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,924
But I'm not gonna let you fuck my company.

294
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,089
I'm going to have to issue a press release
explaining what you did and why.

295
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,650
No, no, come on. This isn't out.

296
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,530
-It's one PR guy.
- That we know of, Erlich.

297
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,682
How many other people
saw that piece of paper?

298
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,207
How many people has this guy talked to?

299
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,602
This is Silicon Valley.
Rumors spread like light speed here.

300
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,690
How are we gonna get
good people to work for us

301
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,286
if they think something funky
is going on with our stock?

302
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,405
How are we going to scale?
This is gonna kill us.

303
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,051
Richard, do you know what happens
if this goes public?

304
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,202
- I'm Ron Wayne.
- Who?

305
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:35,604
Ron Wayne, the guy that owned 10% of Apple
and sold it in 1976.

306
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,762
No one in this town
will work with me ever again.

307
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,401
You want me to risk
the entire future of Pied Piper,

308
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,608
everything that I've worked for,

309
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,561
just to protect you from
your own fucking incompetence?

310
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,690
Richard, there's a 3% to 4% chance
that this is going to get out on its own,

311
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,728
but there is 100% chance

312
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,283
that if you issue a press release
no one will ever take me seriously again.

313
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,042
My dignity is in your hands, Richard.

314
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,331
Do with it what you will.

315
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,686
Gavin? Is that you?

316
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,081
Jack Barker. Nice plane.

317
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,650
Yours, too. Where are you headed?

318
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,291
I just needed to take a walk
and clear my head.

319
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,284
There's this great little hiking trail
near my lodge in Jackson Hole.

320
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,086
Get out of here.
I'm on my way up to J Hole myself.

321
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,810
Is that right? I thought you sold.

322
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,723
No, I just never go there.

323
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,321
So how long you going for?

324
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,811
Coming back tomorrow afternoon.

325
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,360
- Me, too.
- Oh, come on. Come on.

326
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:42,443
Seriously, we need to find a couple hours,
get together, catch up.

327
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,806
I could tell you some war stories.

328
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,046
Well, I'd love that.

329
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,367
I could tell you a few of my own.

330
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,126
- Well, be well.
- You, too.

331
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,043
- Take care, Jack.
- Yeah. See you.

332
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,361
Gavin?

333
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,086
Wait.

334
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,207
Uh, what are we doing here?

335
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,763
I mean, you're on your way to Jackson Hole,
I'm going to Jackson Hole.

336
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,730
You seem like you could use some company.

337
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,843
- You play chess?
- I do. Indeed.

338
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,285
Fantastic.

339
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,807
I tell you, when we get up to altitude
and the Wi-Fi kicks in,

340
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,282
I'm ActionJB62 on Hooli chat.

341
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,725
- Find me.
- I will.

342
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,882
- I'm glad we bumped into each other.
- Me, too.

343
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,362
- Really is a small world.
-It's crazy.

344
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,643
Okay, well, uh, I think it reads well.

345
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,321
And it's all in there.
This will definitely set the record straight.

346
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,880
Then again, you're basically
lighting Erlich on fire.

347
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,406
So what? He fucked the company.

348
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,881
He potentially fucked the company.

349
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,645
Are you kidding me?
Gilfoyle, back me up here.

350
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,881
This is thorny.

351
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,644
How is this even a question for you guys?

352
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,041
Honestly. I mean, it's not like
he's going to be out on the street.

353
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,444
He just sold 10% of a company
that's valued at least $50 million,

354
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,171
and now, suddenly,
we're giving him the benefit of the doubt?

355
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,927
Well, it sounds mighty Christian of you,
Gilfoyle.

356
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,362
There's no reason for hate speech, Richard.

357
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,209
I can see by the sour, pinched expressions
on all your faces

358
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,126
that Richard has filled you in
regarding the unfortunate circumstances

359
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:21,125
that have forced me to relinquish my stake
in your fair company.

360
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,047
Erlich, you should know that
I have written a press release.

361
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,328
- Oh?
- I'm not going to release it yet,

362
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,649
but if I hear wind of these rumors
spreading out of control,

363
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,611
I'm going to send it to every tech publication
and blog on the face of the Earth.

364
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,761
Do you understand?

365
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,047
- Even UPROXX?
- Yes, even them.

366
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,160
Also, uh...

367
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,690
This is the check for next month's use
of the house as our office,

368
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,728
but we'll be out by the end of the month.

369
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,689
Richard, it doesn't have to be like this.

370
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,401
From this point forward, you will have
nothing to do with this company whatsoever.

371
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,166
I'm replacing you on the board,
and I'm giving your seat to Jared.

372
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,128
- So that's it then.
- Yes.

373
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,361
So I guess we better get ready
for that Vanity <i>Fair</i> event.

374
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,966
What?

375
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,284
Did you not listen to a word I just said?

376
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,688
I heard thousands of words
about rumors and the need to contain them.

377
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,570
What do you think would happen
if I didn't show up to this Vanity Fair event?

378
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,051
I've already RSVP'd

379
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,727
and given them a list of phony
dietary restrictions just to cause a scene.

380
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,802
I told them I was pesca-pescatarian.

381
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,130
Which is one who eats solely fish
who eat other fish.

382
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,203
I think my absence would be noted.

383
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,767
- Erlich brings up a good point.
-It's true.

384
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,450
Let us not forget Meinertzhagen's...

385
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,284
Yes, yes, Meinertzhagen's Haversack.

386
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,362
We all remember his sack.

387
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,849
Okay, fine. Yeah.

388
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,888
Sure. You can come. I can't stop you.

389
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,688
Uh, I'll be taking the car and the hotel room
and you're going to have to drive yourself.

390
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,091
Consider it my farewell dinner.

391
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,406
See you at the event.

392
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,528
- Jared, are you okay?
-It's just so many emotions.

393
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,049
The board seat. I feel regret and a glee
that you would choose to honor me,

394
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,841
and terror at not living up
to your expectations,

395
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,531
and compassion for Erlich's loss.

396
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:19,051
Oh, Donald, you've come undone.

397
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,521
You still want him on the board?

398
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,008
Hi, there. Checking in. Richard Hendricks.

399
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,411
Fuck me. Hey, Richie.

400
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,965
Oh, God. Hey, Russ.

401
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,530
What's up, boy genius? You here fucking?

402
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,841
Huh? No. No, no, no fucking.

403
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,491
<i>Just here for the Vanity Fair dinner.</i>

404
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,721
Oh, yeah, I know that stupid dinner.

405
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,802
Bunch of VC douchebags
jerking each other off.

406
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,564
Speaking of, I got this girl at the bar,

407
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,085
I'm trying to take her up
to the presidential suite

408
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,770
before her fucking bridesmaids
ruin the whole thing,

409
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,365
but they're telling me it's booked.

410
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,529
Who is it? Is it Gore? Fuck that guy.

411
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,329
- Oh, God.
- I saw Pied Piper launched.

412
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,686
Haven't tried it, probably won't.

413
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,446
I don't even want to think about how fucked
I got missing out on Erlich's shares. Fuck.

414
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,044
Wait, he tried to sell you his shares?

415
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,726
Well, half of them.
He was pretty desperate to stay on the team.

416
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,802
Well, he didn't mention
anything about this to me.

417
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,565
Of course not. Why would he?
It's fucking humiliating losing all your money.

418
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,723
You think when I dropped below $1 billion
I walked around telling everybody? Fuck no.

419
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,847
You guys were the only ones who knew,

420
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,046
and I actually thought about
having you killed.

421
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,327
- I'm sorry, what?
- So Erlich and I, like two weeks ago,

422
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,566
we had a contract ready.

423
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,529
Five mil
I was gonna pay him for half his shares.

424
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,967
It was a win-win.
Then that robot, Laurie Bream,

425
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,849
sweeps in and cockblocks the whole thing.

426
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,730
She forces him to sell her all his shares.
You think she's gay?

427
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,885
Maybe. It hasn't come up.
I... So wait, she outbid you?

428
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,928
Outbid me? No, she didn't have to.

429
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,361
You don't even know how
your own fucking company works?

430
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,489
All right, Mr. Hendricks, we have you
staying one night in a deluxe double.

431
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,641
Okay, do you have a tub in that room?

432
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,801
Does he have a tub in that room?

433
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,927
I don't know. There's no way of telling.

434
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,082
You know what? Fuck it.
I'm gonna take her to the W.

435
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,845
She's so drunk she won't know the difference.
See you around, Richie.

436
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,605
<i>Hey, it's C.J.</i>

437
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,685
<i>Listen, I'm hearing a rumor about
some serious ugliness going on at Pied Piper.</i>

438
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,649
<i>I've heard it from three different people now.
You need to call me.</i>

439
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,366
Fuck.

440
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,610
What in God's name is the reason
to get a higher education?

441
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,523
You can just buy a megafreeze for 35 cents.

442
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,045
Laurie, can I talk to you for a second?

443
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,805
Yes, uh, Richard Hendricks,
do you know Mark Pincus?

444
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,881
Hello. Big fan.

445
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,928
Oh, okay. Yes. Um...

446
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,923
- Sorry, just one second.
- Yes. All right.

447
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,085
I'm sorry to cut away like this.
We can continue discussing this.

448
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,930
Okay, uh, look,
I know Erlich sold you all of his shares.

449
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,970
I'm just wondering
exactly how that happened.

450
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,486
Ah, yes. It was one of my finer moments.

451
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:46,451
Erlich came to me with an outside offer
to sell half of his Pied Piper shares.

452
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,444
To Russ Hanneman for $5 million.
Yes, I know.

453
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,649
But somehow you ended up
with all of his shares. How?

454
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,042
Oh, well, as you know,
the same onerous terms you accepted

455
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,804
when you took Russ Hanneman's money,

456
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,684
they transferred to me when I bought him out.

457
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,762
These included the right
to block any transfer of stocks

458
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,247
with a majority vote of the board.
A board which I control.

459
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,329
- I don't understand.
- Of course you do.

460
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,924
If I have approval of any buyer,
and I am the only buyer I approve,

461
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,764
then I can set my own price.

462
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:18,011
So I asked Mr. Bachman
for a thorough accounting of his debts,

463
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,845
which ran to approximately $713,000.

464
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,649
And how much did you give him?

465
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,609
$713,000.

466
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,207
Jesus. So, he walked away with nothing.

467
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:32,683
Oh, yes. And so as I said,
you're the one who accepted these terms,

468
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,649
so you're the one
who enabled this action on my part.

469
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,768
All credit goes to you, Richard. Excuse me.

470
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,808
Dick. Dick Costolo. One moment.

471
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,006
I need to speak with you.

472
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,290
It's expensive to replant.

473
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,807
No. The vines are bad. The soil is bad.

474
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,242
Excuse me, what is that?

475
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,805
That's pesca-pescatarian.

476
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,243
- It's fish that...
- Actually, just bring me one of those.

477
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,890
- Me, too.
- Yeah, waiter, I'll take one, too.

478
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,803
- I want one.
- I want one of those also.

479
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,890
Wait, hey, hey, I'd like that also.

480
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,210
Excuse me,
if he's having one, I want one.

481
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,089
You're getting that, I want it, too.
Excuse me!

482
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,400
Hey, I thought you were at the dinner.

483
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,720
I left.

484
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,851
Erlich never showed. Is he here?

485
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,082
Yeah. He's hiding in the backyard.

486
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,491
Why?

487
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,089
Have you not seen the article?

488
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,161
No.

489
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,684
"Is Erlich Bachman
the Dumbest Man in Tech"?

490
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,206
What the hell is this?
I never sent anything out.

491
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,529
- Who did they talk to?
- Erlich.

492
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,368
This is C.J.'s blog.
He outed himself to protect Pied Piper.

493
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,681
Yeah, this is way harsher
than anything you ever wrote.

494
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,849
Plus, there's the visual component.

495
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:02,050
Speaking of... Where's your jacket, Jared?

496
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,328
That was quite a piece.

497
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,969
Informative. Thorough.

498
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,168
You certainly know how to make an impact.

499
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,684
And I guess I don't have to worry about
any rumors coming out.

500
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,046
Those are handled.

501
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:26,160
You know, Erlich, uh,
Pied Piper still needs a head of PR.

502
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,960
You seem to be well-versed
in media outreach.

503
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,849
And by your own admission in that article,
your head is, uh, what did you say,

504
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,249
so far up your own ass
you can see the future.

505
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,321
And that could be useful.

506
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,724
If we need a pre-cog...

507
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,121
...in away.

508
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,005
Uh, I don't know if you're available, so...

509
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,401
Are you offering me a job?

510
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,403
Well, we have a good option package.

511
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,806
It won't be quite what you had,
but it's something.

512
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,251
That's very generous.

513
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,971
So things could go back
to the way they were before.

514
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,010
Well, no. No. Not exactly the way they were.

515
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,768
No, no. Uh, well, this would be an actual job
and you would have responsibilities.

516
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,207
Would this job have a title?

517
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:21,126
Something, say, Chief Evangelism Officer?

518
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,884
So, "CEO"?

519
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,367
- Oh, my goodness!
- What the fuck was that?

520
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,521
Richard.

521
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,251
The Pied Piper app
just got accepted into the Hooli store.

522
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,051
What? Holy shit.

523
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:39,047
Gavin Belson just presented us
with his bare buttocks in submission.

524
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,407
We beat him. I don't hug. No.

525
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:45,485
Um, okay, hey, look, time to issue
your first press release, right?

526
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,883
It's very late, Richard, and I'm very high.

527
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,041
Erlich, I don't care.

528
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,043
You have to do it, okay? Now.

529
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,407
- It's your job.
- Okay.

530
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,686
All right.

531
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,926
C.J. Cantwell.

532
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,923
<i>Erlich Bachman. The reason I'm calling</i>

533
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:08,921
has absolutely nothing to do whatsoever
with the fact that I own half of your blog

534
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,729
<i>and everything to do with the fact</i>

535
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:15,044
that I was just named
Chief Evangelism Officer of Pied Piper.

536
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,086
<i>Feel free to abbreviate that,
whatever acronym is most economical.</i>

537
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,207
And I have a story.

538
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,931
<i>Well, if it's anything like this last one,
I am all for it.</i>

539
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,606
I am getting so many paid views
on your tell-all.

540
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,523
<i>Everyone in the Valley is reading it.</i>

541
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,843
Well, that's good. For you.

542
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,445
At my expense, I guess.

543
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,450
Anyway, I had no choice.

544
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,409
As you said, it was going to come out
one way or another.

545
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,926
Why? No one knew about any of it
until you told me.

546
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,924
What do you mean? You said that
you had heard from a bunch of people

547
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,129
that there are all these rumors
about ugly shit going down at Pied Piper.

548
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,771
That's literally the only reason
that I told you any of this.

549
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:53,289
What?
Oh, yeah, three different people told me

550
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,727
that Pied Piper had
the ugliest jackets they'd ever seen.

551
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,807
Jackets?

552
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,962
I was going to do, like,
a whole swag fail thing, you know?

553
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,491
<i>That could have been cool, no?</i>

554
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,683
Who the fuck cares about jackets?

555
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,287
Hey, come on, <i>babe</i>

556
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,124

<i>Girl, don't be scared to move</i>

566
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,206
<i>Hey, babe, what are you tryin' to prove</i>

567
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:44,205
<i>It ain't true that your life has kicked you</i>

568
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:49,605
<i>It's your mind and that's all that's trickin' you</i>

569
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,366
<i>So step in line</i>
