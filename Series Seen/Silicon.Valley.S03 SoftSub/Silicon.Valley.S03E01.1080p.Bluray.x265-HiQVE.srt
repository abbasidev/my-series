1
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,090
I just got fired.

2
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,805
And what about me?

3
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,124
What about you?

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,321
What about me?

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,761
Okay. That's it.

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,325
I'm going over there right fucking now,
before they leave and...

7
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,603
Erlich, I'm gonna use your car.

8
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,331
Jared, you call Ron LaFlamme,
tell him to meet me there.

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,765
Fuck these assholes!

10
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,320
Wait. Richard, I'm coming with you.

11
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,164
Here. Jared, clear this.

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,241
Get all the smoke out of it.

13
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,442
- Otherwise, it damages the device.
- Um...

14
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,291
Don't be a pussy.

15
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,841
How could they do this?

16
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,604
How could they fire me
from my own company?

17
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,284
Just stay calm.
We're gonna fight this.

18
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,725
Jesus, Richard, slow down.

19
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,366
Stop, stop, stop!

20
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,647
Ah!

21
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,850
Did I just hit a deer?

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,251
No, God damn it!

23
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,084
Fucking Stanford Robotics.

24
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,162
Shit. Is this gonna make us late?

25
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,448
Oh. They killed the Bam-bot.

26
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,002
Fuck your Bam-bot!
You little Stanford cunts fucked up my grille!

27
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,889
- Fucking piece of shit!
- Wait.

28
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,007
You little cunt!

29
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,127
- Fuck!
- Hey.

30
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,565
This one's for your mama.

31
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,847
Erlich, stop. Come on.
Erlich, we've got to get to Raviga.

32
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,490
Hey, oh, no, no. Hey, hey, hey.

33
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,521
Thanks for coming, Ron.

34
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,285
I'd bail on spin class
any day for you, Richie.

35
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,761
Richard. Richard.

36
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,524
I kept calling, you weren't answering.

37
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,284
Talk to the hand, Monica.

38
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,601
Richard, can you stop? I can explain, okay?

39
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,241
It's pretty self-explanatory, Monica.
You voted to fire me.

40
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,370
What the fuck?

41
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,490
I mean, there is no way
I'm letting you push me out of this.

42
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,483
Our intention is not to push you out.

43
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,204
We wish rather to transition you

44
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,169
to a more appropriate role
within the company.

45
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,164
A new CEO will be brought in
to manage day-to-day operations

46
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,529
while you assume the role
of Chief Technology Officer.

47
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,329
Congratulations.

48
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,129
- CTO?
- Yes.

49
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,961
You want me to be an employee
at my own company?

50
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,168
You would still be in charge
of the engineering,

51
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,369
and you'd continue vesting your shares,
and keep your board seat.

52
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,525
Oh, the same seat I had an hour ago
when you voted to fire me as CEO?

53
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,887
- That came in handy.
- Richard, please.

54
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,442
I realize this may be bittersweet,
but earlier this evening,

55
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,922
Raviga decided to officially fund
Pied Piper Series A Round

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,924
at $5 million at a $50-million valuation.

57
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,926
Essentially, you have created
a company that is too valuable for you to run.

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,001
You should feel good about that.

59
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,684
Are you kidding me?
I made the company, okay?

60
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,127
I'm the one who came up
with the name "Pied Piper."

61
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,681
Yes.

62
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,524
Ron, can I have a word, please?

63
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,209
They can't really do this, can they?

64
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,487
I think they just did.

65
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,245
You remember that shit deal
you brought me from Hanneman,

66
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,402
and I said, "Hey, Richie, this is a shit deal,"

67
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,527
but you took it anyway

68
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,649
because you wanted to do
something crazy for once in your life?

69
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,881
Yes, I remember.

70
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,282
Well, you basically just loaded a gun
and handed it to Hanneman,

71
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,522
and Hanneman sold that gun to Raviga,

72
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,285
and then Raviga just fucking
pistol-whipped you.

73
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,481
But, hey, at least they're letting you keep
your shares and your board seat.

74
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,251
You lose a little blood
with the dilution for the new CEO,

75
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,163
but I've seen worse.

76
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,163
Like that shit deal
you brought me from Hanneman.

77
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,883
If we give Richard a little bit of space,
he'll be able to wrap his head around this,

78
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,486
and a smooth transition
to a new CEO will be possible.

79
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,689
To wit, I served as the CEO of...

80
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,922
Mr. Bachman.

81
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,567
In the version of Pied Piper
in which I am invested,

82
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,326
you will not be CEO. Not now. Not ever.

83
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,930
Well, you, madam,
are a shrew of the first order.

84
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,288
Okay. I'm not gonna let you do this.
I'm gonna fight it.

85
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,771
I understand you're upset.

86
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,680
As you can see, this is
a very emotional time for me as well,

87
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,560
but we have some very strong candidates
coming in for the CEO position,

88
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,768
and we would so appreciate your input.

89
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,683
- My input?
- Mmm.

90
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:21,328
You want me to help you pick
my new replacement?

91
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,290
I'd rather quit.

92
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,089
And I don't care how much money I lose,

93
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,966
because I am gonna get it all back
when I sue the living shit out of you!

94
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,208
Okay. All right. All right.

95
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,201
Ron, let's go.

96
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,442
I'm sorry, I'm forced to inform you

97
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,763
that I can no longer provide you
with legal counsel.

98
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,840
What are you talking about?
You're my attorney.

99
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,165
No. Technically,
I'm Pied Piper's corporate counsel,

100
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,966
and you just declared your intention to walk.

101
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,728
So, in effect,
you kind of just threatened to sue me,

102
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,406
and I don't take kindly
to threats, Mr. Hendricks.

103
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,805
"Mr. Hendricks"? What happened to "Richie"?

104
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,962
Unfortunately, I'm not
at liberty to discuss him

105
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,644
with you, either, Mr. Hendricks.

106
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,326
Richard, if I didn't vote to remove you,
then Laurie would've adjourned the meeting,

107
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,641
replaced my seat on the board
with someone else at Raviga,

108
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,449
and then they would've voted to remove you.

109
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,284
At least this way, I'm still in the game.

110
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,442
No. You mean,
at least this way, you kept your job.

111
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,129
At least the actual Judas
had the courtesy to kill himself

112
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,680
after betraying his leader, Jesus Christ.

113
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,081
He's the CEO of the world. Ever heard of him?

114
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,889
Yeah. Got it. Went to Catholic school.

115
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,121
Really? How long?

116
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:41,608
Look, I'm still on the board of this company.
I'll be in all of the meetings.

117
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,364
Maybe I can be helpful at some point.

118
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,331
You wanna be helpful, Monica?
Convince Laurie to keep me on as CEO.

119
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,689
Look, I know I made some mistakes.
I wasn't perfect, but I'll get better.

120
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,367
I'll even go to one of those CEO coaches,
like that guy at fucking Twitter.

121
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,161
Richard, it's done.
Laurie already found a new CEO.

122
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,881
What? Already?

123
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,201
You said that you didn't want
to be part of the interview process,

124
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,089
so, they picked someone this morning.

125
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,370
Jack Barker.
He's an incredibly skilled, top-notch CEO.

126
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,169
I don't care who he is, okay? None of us do.

127
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,961
"Action" Jack Barker?

128
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,723
Seriously? They picked that
gray-haired fossil over me?

129
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,450
You said you turned the job down.

130
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,650
I said it was mutual.

131
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,887
Oh.

132
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,371
What? That's accurate.

133
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,363
Oh, he ran Entercross Systems.

134
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,649
They IPO'ed in 1998 for
more than a billion dollars.

135
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,729
Yeah, 20 fucking years ago.

136
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,768
Tech 1.0. What has he done lately?

137
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,571
After that, he ran Turnwire for four years

138
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,042
until it was acquired
by Microsoft for $2 billion.

139
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,327
Holy shit. This guy's a hitter.

140
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,165
He was, in the aughts.
What's he done in the 20-teens?

141
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,811
Looks like he started a foundation
in his mother's name to cure cancer.

142
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,609
Yeah, how's that going?

143
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,603
Yeah. I bet his mother's dead.

144
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,251
Yeah, that's probably why
he started the foundation.

145
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,762
Richard, Laurie's meeting with him tomorrow.
You should come in and talk with him.

146
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,524
No fucking way.

147
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,250
Think this through. I mean, you have to know

148
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,362
that you can't start
another compression company.

149
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,842
No VC will fund that out of fear of being sued,

150
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,207
and, I mean, unless you have
some totally different,

151
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,964
game-changing idea lying around...

152
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,481
So, you're saying that I'm fucked if I leave?

153
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,644
No, I'm saying that...

154
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,769
Okay. Well, then I guess I'm fucked,
because I'm out.

155
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,202
And when I leave,
Jared's out, Dinesh is out, Gilfoyle is out.

156
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,527
Everybody's out.

157
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,443
So, good luck
with the company there, Monica.

158
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,170
It'll just be you, Laurie Bream,

159
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,050
and some fucking asshole
who can't even cure cancer.

160
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,723
He's right. Where Richard goes, I go.

161
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,124
Monica, excuse how high I am,

162
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,090
but are the uniforms in Catholic schools
as low-out as they are online?

163
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,207
Fuck off.

164
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,684
Did you tell Richard you were out?

165
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,401
No. Did you?

166
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,887
No.

167
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,801
Are we out?

168
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,361
Hmm.

169
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,606
Did Gavin tell you what this is about?

170
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,842
We haven't spoken in some time.

171
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,043
<i>Thank you all for coming
on such short notice.</i>

172
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,084
<i>I have a difficult announcement to make.</i>

173
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,809
<i>We in the tech business
often refer to failure as a good thing.</i>

174
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,247
<i>Failure is growth. Failure is learning.</i>

175
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,884
<i>But sometimes, failure is just failure.</i>

176
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,200
<i>I think...</i>

177
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,410
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

178
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,606
<i>I didn't think it would be this hard.</i>

179
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:45,248
<i>But goodbyes are always hard,
especially when I am the one saying goodbye.</i>

180
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,889
<i>Today, effective immediately,</i>

181
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,001
<i>I, Gavin Belson, founder and CEO of Hooli,</i>

182
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,246
<i>am forced to officially say goodbye
to the entire Nucleus division.</i>

183
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,089
<i>All Nucleus personnel
will be given proper notice and terminated.</i>

184
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,525
<i>But make no mistake.</i>

185
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,931
<i>Though they're the ones leaving,</i>

186
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,968
<i>it is I who must remain
and bear the heavy burden of their failure.</i>

187
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,883
<i>It is my fault.</i>

188
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,248
<i>I trusted them to get the job done.</i>

189
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,721
<i>But that is the price of leadership.</i>

190
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,561
<i>Thank you.</i>

191
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,047
That was the gutsiest thing I've ever seen.

192
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,326
Amazing.

193
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,365
So, wait, does that mean...

194
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,606
Uh...

195
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,286
Denpok? Can I have your Big Gulp?

196
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,727
I know we keep saying this,
but even though Richard is a great guy...

197
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,926
And a brilliant coder.

198
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,490
He's wonderful.

199
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,244
Nevertheless,

200
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,850
he is lacking in certain...

201
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,043
...managerial capacities.

202
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,326
- Totally fair.
-It's fair, right?

203
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,640
He's still a great coder.

204
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,643
And an amazing human being.

205
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,370
- Okay, look.
- Such...

206
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,169
We have a lot of shit
we want to say about him.

207
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,641
Do we have to keep
prefacing it with all this nice-guy stuff?

208
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,688
I mean, if so, we're gonna be here all night.

209
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,966
Yeah, we kind of do, though,

210
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,202
just to offset the Denpok
of all the shitty stuff.

211
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,803
What if we use, like, a dictionary patch?

212
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,804
To compress all the nice-guy stuff.

213
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,211
Like an acronym.

214
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,327
Exactly.

215
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,802
"Richard is great, but you know..."

216
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,120
R-I-G-B-Y.

217
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,326
Rig DY-

218
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,210
Rigby is all the nice-guy stuff.

219
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,089
Okay. Rig by-

220
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,969
But he just assumed we were
gonna leave with him,

221
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,769
which is kind Of total bullshit, right?

222
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,966
That's really arrogant.

223
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,409
Rigby, we gave up our own apps
so that we could bust our asses for him.

224
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,721
Why the fuck should we give up
our Pied Piper shares

225
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,961
right when we get funded,

226
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,641
because he's too much of a prima donna
to let someone experienced come in

227
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,927
and run the company the way
it's supposed to be run?

228
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,206
_Rigby.
- Rigby,

229
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,521
now I'm actually getting
kind of fucking angry.

230
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,171
I mean, we put in so much work, for no pay,

231
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,810
and now he thinks
he's gonna walk out on us?

232
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,565
I mean, seriously, fuck that guy.
Fuck him. Rigby.

233
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,364
What are we gonna do?

234
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,080
- Rigby.
- Rigby.

235
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,045
Richard, I have something
that might cheer you up.

236
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,560
- What is this?
- Go on, Gloomy Gus, open it.

237
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,406
Okay.

238
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:36,729
So, this is a box of files with
companies' information on it?

239
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,970
No. These are all companies
that I took the liberty of reaching out to

240
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,045
that are actually offering you the job of CTO.

241
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,121
Really?

242
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,089
Some of these companies are pretty good.

243
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,726
Flutterbeam's, like, really good.

244
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,802
Of course it is. They all are.

245
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,165
You're the belle of the ball,

246
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:00,087
and these are all your swains,
hoping for a glimpse of ankle.

247
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,882
Oh, the nest wherein the asp doth coil.

248
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,365
Where's Richard? Is he coming?

249
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,845
Nope.

250
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,725
Congratulations, you've successfully
broken a good man.

251
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,001
Is that Barker?

252
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,366
Uh... Yeah.

253
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,051
What are you gonna do?

254
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,681
I just spent the last 16 hours
cherry-picking Friars <i>Roasts</i>

255
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,121
for the premium old-man jokes.

256
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,802
Essentially, I'm going to beat him to death
with his own titanium hips.

257
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,008
Not just for me, but for Richard.

258
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,521
Jack Barker, aka Action Jack.

259
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,127
We meet at last.

260
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,321
Erlich Bachman.

261
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,770
Mr. Bachman. Pleasure to finally meet you.
I'm a big fan.

262
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,322
Oh, really? Of what? Metamucil? Polio?

263
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,210
The phonograph? A nice piece of fish?

264
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,529
Segregated water fountains?

265
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,243
Senior citizen discounts
at Perkins family restaurants?

266
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,682
Erectile dysfunction because
of corroded penile arteries?

267
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,521
Deviled eggs as an Flutterbeam's?

268
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,767
Liking Ike?

269
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,966
No.

270
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,647
None of those, Mr. Bachman.
I am a fan of yours.

271
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,088
Have been ever since
you were at the helm of Aviato.

272
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,365
You know Aviato?

273
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,602
Yes. Aviato.

274
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,401
My Aviato?

275
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,889
Is there any other Aviato?

276
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,444
Well, legally, there cannot be.

277
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,646
Mr. Barker, pleasure to meet you.

278
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,165
- Is that a poppy seed muffin?
- Yes, sir.

279
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,561
Well, Poppy wants one
'cause Mommy already got hers.

280
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,847
Hooli stock jumped 7% today

281
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,849
on this news that Gavin Belson
is writing down

282
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,729
the entire Nucleus project.

283
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,801
<i>What's happening here?</i>

284
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,927
<i>It was a courageous move.</i>

285
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,366
<i>He's a straight shooter,</i>

286
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,522
<i>and obviously Wall Street
is responding to that.</i>

287
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,045
<i>WOMAN". So, what else do you think...</i>

288
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,963
So, by our account,

289
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,486
just under 50% of Hooli
employment agreements

290
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,449
include a non-compete clause.

291
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,521
The same clause that caused us
to lose the Pied Piper lawsuit in arbitration

292
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,840
and are thus legally invalid,

293
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,446
calling into question
some of our IP ownership.

294
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,407
Shit. I was afraid of that.

295
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,848
But hypothetically,
this also presents an opportunity.

296
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,051
Any of those people could be
dismissed with no severance.

297
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,124
Any unvested stock
would return to the company option pool.

298
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,444
So, in other words,
we have the right to terminate

299
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,723
any of those people
with no repercussions whatsoever,

300
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,928
and we'd actually make money?

301
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,281
Correct.

302
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,482
You know,
our annual individual performance reviews

303
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,769
showed a 20% incidence
of sub-standard work.

304
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,723
So, essentially, one out of
every five Hooli team members

305
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,325
deserve to be fired.

306
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,486
Oh, I'm sorry. What?

307
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,884
- So, are you nervous?
- Uh...

308
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,082
No, actually. I feel pretty good.

309
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,164
Flutterbeam was the best company
we looked at.

310
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,483
Their tech is great. Their offer is amazing.
Actually, I'm kind of pumped.

311
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,404
Well, your Flutterbeam makes me pumped.

312
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,561
You just got... Okay.

313
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,681
- I'll do it.
- Yeah.

314
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,811
All right. Uh, well, Jared, uh,

315
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,284
we gotta, one day, figure out
what we're gonna do for you, for a job.

316
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,651
Richard, you'll go. You'll establish yourself,
and when the time is right, you'll send for me.

317
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,961
Richard, you have to talk to this man.

318
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,364
Who, Barker? Pass.

319
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,124
This guy is real, okay, Richard?

320
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,449
With his managerial skills
and your talent as an engineer,

321
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,045
we could be talking about the D-word here.

322
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,604
- Dick?
- No. Decacorn.

323
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,971
A company that's valued over
$10 billion before its initial public offering.

324
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,441
All right?

325
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,330
He's still at Raviga for another hour.
Please, go talk to him.

326
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,643
Sorry, I can't do that.
I'm already set up at Flutterbeam.

327
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,764
Whose CEO, unprompted, said,

328
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,208
"A brain like Richard's
comes along once in a generation."

329
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,724
Sorry. I'm just proud.

330
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,562
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

331
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,967
Richard, I'm not asking you
to spoon with the guy,

332
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,201
or even fork him.

333
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,726
- What I'm asking for...
- What is that?

334
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,121
Forking is when you use
your dick and your two legs

335
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,571
to stab him in the lower torso.

336
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,967
I'm asking for you
to take 10 minutes and talk to him

337
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,008
before you throw everything
that we built away.

338
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,122
And, yes, I did say "we."

339
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:24,003
I mean, if you want to stop by Raviga,
it's on the way to Flutterbeam.

340
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,530
I mean, I threw some Tyson-level
Decacorn at this guy.

341
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,207
Richard, he didn't even flinch.
He floats like a butterfly.

342
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,850
Hey, Richard.

343
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,763
- What's going on?
- Um...

344
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,129
- We've been talking.
- Okay.

345
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,680
Guys, this isn't really a great time. Richard.

346
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,491
Uh, we wanna tell you something. Right?

347
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,526
Yeah, it's something important.

348
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,284
Maybe later. So, Richard?

349
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,481
Guys, come on.

350
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,569
We... We know you're leaving...

351
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,324
- Yep. Well aware.
- But“

352
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,001
- We're not. Yeah.
- We're gonna stay at Pied Piper.

353
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,527
Really?

354
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,211
Why are you laughing?

355
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,089
I'm sorry. Wow. Uh...

356
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,405
Well, it's just that you really think

357
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,211
that you're gonna be able to scale
the platform without me?

358
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,486
God damn it.

359
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,005
- Yeah.
- Oh, you don't think we can?

360
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,366
Well, I know you can't.

361
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,521
That's a bold statement.

362
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,086
- Richard.
- We have massive tech debt.

363
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,563
You really think that you can
scale and deploy my library

364
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,244
without any input from me?

365
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,806
Are you serious here?

366
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,961
- Yes, we do.
- Yeah.

367
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,805
Then I guess you are truly delusional.

368
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,690
Well, I think you're an arrogant prick.

369
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,721
I'm the arrogant prick.

370
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,040
Okay. This is coming from two people

371
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,811
who think they know everything about code
they didn't even write.

372
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,689
We wrote a lot of the code.

373
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,206
- You wrote some of it.
- You know what? We're gonna stay,

374
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,647
and we're gonna build Pied Piper
just to prove you wrong.

375
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,405
Okay. Thank you for the solidarity by the way,
and sticking with your friend.

376
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,527
Uh, you know what, Erlich?

377
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,329
You can tell Barker to go fuck himself,

378
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,686
so I can go to Flutterbeam

379
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,929
and then watch these two assholes
crash and burn

380
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,401
trying to build out Pied Piper by themselves.

381
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,686
This'll be great.

382
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,730
Great timing, guys.
Thank you so much.

383
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,165
Premium stuff, Dinesh.

384
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,920
Richard. Richard?

385
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,682
Well, we are now living in a post-Rigby world.

386
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,122
Man, this place is amazing.

387
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,005
Yeah. We raised a shit-ton of money.

388
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,282
We're growing fast as balls.

389
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,410
But we're not exactly super-psyched
with the quality of our engineering.

390
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,130
Well, it's a good thing I'm here then, right?

391
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,362
Yeah.

392
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,289
Uh, all joking aside,
I actually have a few thoughts

393
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,691
on your video platform if you...

394
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,286
Oh, uh, we're pretty happy
with the basic platform.

395
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,249
We want to hand you something way cooler.

396
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,890
It's kind of like a secret project.

397
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,081
I got to warn you, though. It's pretty rad.

398
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,084
Sit right here.

399
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,127
Okay.

400
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,929
- All right.
- Oh, hello.

401
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,729
This is the present.

402
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,040
You ready to go to the future?

403
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,287
Sure.

404
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,641
Three, two, one.

405
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,406
Barn!

406
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,407
Oh. I have a mustache.

407
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,527
Fuck yeah, you do.

408
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,647
And check this out.

409
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,688
Turn your head. See that?

410
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,969
Decacorn perfect
3D holographic mustaches

411
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,209
using depth-sensing cameras
in a live video chat.

412
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,044
- And no one's doing it.
- Nobody.

413
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,126
Sorry. This is the rad thing?

414
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,931
Look, Richard, we agree, okay?
We're not there yet.

415
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,562
We're using a crappy plug-in,
so the latency is bad.

416
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,924
You turn too fast,
that mustache is on your ear.

417
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,811
But with your help,
we think we can cut our 'Decacorn lag

418
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:30,761
to just 20 millisecond motion-to-photon
in nine months.

419
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,531
Just in time for Movember.

420
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,921
So, uh, which one do you want
on your employee badge?

421
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,171
- Tom Selleck?
- Aloha.

422
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,441
Ooh, Fu Manchu.

423
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,571
- John Waters.
- Not bad.

424
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,369
- Alex Trebek. Hitler.
<i>- What is</i> a mustache?

425
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,283
- Oh, probably not Hitler. Skip him.
- Yeah.

426
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,203
- Bam! Sam Elliott.
- Howdy.

427
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,886
Sure.

428
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,007
Oh. Uh...

429
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,521
Okay, so we've got to hop
on a call with biz Bam...

430
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,444
- Okay.
- But feel free to keep on 'Bam. Okay?

431
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,246
- There you go.
- All right.

432
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,605
Oh, hey, if you want to have your attorney
look over the employment agreement

433
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,843
and the stock option grant,
it's cool by us, all right?

434
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,809
Just sign it. You're in.

435
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,530
We'll see you Monday, man. We're pumped.

436
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:10,891
Okay. Well, your Bam
makes me pumped.

437
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:30,646
Pete Monahan, please. It's Richard Hendricks.
I just need him to go over a contract for me.

438
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,641
What?

439
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,571
Are you an attorney here to see a client?

440
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,645
Uh, no. Actually I'm a client
here to see my attorney.

441
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,330
Okay. Follow me.

442
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:50,402
It began as an innocent celebration
of our arbitration victory.

443
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,321
I ordered a Monahan,
which I did not realize contained alcohol.

444
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,610
It was described to me
as a healthy, organic tea.

445
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,729
Next thing I knew, I was 70 miles away,
wrapped naked in a blanket,

446
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,450
shaking off a Monahan high,

447
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,649
and facing charges
for attacking a police horse with a shovel.

448
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,681
Oh.

449
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,927
Holy shit.

450
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,651
From a legal standpoint,
it was a clear violation of my parole,

451
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,326
and I must now serve my entire sentence.

452
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,447
Okay.

453
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,251
And any additional time
stemming from the new charges,

454
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,930
which continue to accrue.

455
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,531
- But I'm owning my mistakes.
- Oh.

456
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,324
I am staying positive.

457
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,128
Enough about me.
Let's take a look at that contract.

458
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,801
Okay. Uh...

459
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,246
I would red-line it,
but I'm not allowed to have a pencil.

460
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,561
Oh.

461
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,168
This makes less sense the more I look at it.

462
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,891
Okay. What's this number over here?

463
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,769
I don't know.
I didn't handle the compression library.

464
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,801
Neither did I.

465
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,288
You're telling me Richard did this
all on his own?

466
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,005
Shit. I thought you did it.

467
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,642
Now I respect you even less.

468
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:09,561
We each know 90% of the platform,
but it's the same 90%.

469
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,809
Maybe that arrogant prick was right.

470
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,086
We can't scale it without him.

471
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,411
We are so fucked.

472
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,646
Wait.

473
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,930
- Yeah?
- I got it.

474
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,528
We quit out of solidarity with Richard.

475
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,130
That's interesting.

476
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,409
So, even though he said
all that horrible shit to us,

477
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,245
we take the high road and we get his back.

478
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,446
Yeah.

479
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,204
Maybe he'll even hire us at his new company.

480
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,129
Flutterbeam.

481
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,043
- Mustaches?
- Uh, yes.

482
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:56,569
Doesn't necessarily have to stop at people.
They can put mustaches on their pets, too.

483
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,971
It's, um, actually pretty fun.

484
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:03,490
So, soon you'll be putting mustaches
on cats and dogs and snakes.

485
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,721
Snakes, yeah, yeah.

486
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,485
I mean, it's a little tricky
because they don't have a Monahan,

487
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:11,804
so, finding an anchor point
for that mustache is actually

488
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,963
gonna be quite of a technological challenge.

489
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,570
- It's exciting stuff. It really is.
- Richard.

490
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,880
Richard.

491
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,845
Let me ask you something.

492
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,325
Why you leaving Pied Piper?

493
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,964
They pushed me out.

494
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,685
I thought they offered you another position.

495
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,802
Yeah, CTO. It's a demotion.

496
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,566
Well, wouldn't you be CTO at Flutterbeam?

497
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,490
Yes, but at least this way,
I don't have to eat shit.

498
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,683
Richard, let me tell you
something I learned here on the inside.

499
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,606
Swallow your pride,

500
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:47,207
or soon you'll be eating
something far worse than shit.

501
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,161
Believe me.

502
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:54,001
Don't you think you should
at least meet this Barker fellow?

503
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,521
So, where are we?

504
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:13,682
1700 people slated for exiting.
Their negated options total 780,000 shares.

505
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,969
That money can be allocated
anyway you see fit.

506
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,169
Employee bonuses, renovations
to the day-care center,

507
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,287
what have you.

508
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,805
What should we prioritize?

509
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,126
<i><i>Sony, I don't understand.</i>

510
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,924
It's all in the document.

511
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,881
Uh, you take that severance package,
and you leave Hooli immediately.

512
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,770
But the most important aspect

513
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,481
is the non-disclosure,
non-disparagement clause,

514
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:45,690
in which you agree not to say
anything negative in the press,

515
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:50,203
in public, or in private,
about Hooli or Gavin Belson.

516
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,360
Okay, I won't.

517
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,604
You will not discuss anything
you did at Hooli at all, in perpetuity,

518
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,806
throughout the universe.

519
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,641
I didn't really do anything at Hooli, so...

520
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,927
Good. You're getting the hang of it already.

521
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,002
So, can I keep my Hooli ID, though,

522
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,970
so I can still come
and hang out with my friends on the roof?

523
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,845
Uh, you cannot.

524
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,491
Officially, you will no longer
have any friends here.

525
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,246
Shoot

526
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,367
I have to think about this, then.

527
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,082
This settlement offer is quite generous.

528
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,562
I know, I know.
I mean, $2 million is a lot of money.

529
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,926
Two? No. It's, um...

530
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,008
It's $20 million.

531
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,926
20?

532
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:46,807
So, they fired me before they hired you,
so, it's not your fault. I just...

533
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,281
I feel like this can't really work.

534
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,444
- Do you understand?
- I do, Richard.

535
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,045
It's like, um,

536
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:58,570
can I really be expected to do my best work
when I am constantly feeling undervalued

537
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,563
at the company that I started?

538
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,883
- Does that make sense?
-It does, Richard. Absolutely.

539
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,804
I hear each and every one
of your concerns loud and clear,

540
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,008
and I appreciate your position.

541
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,081
Mmm.

542
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,084
So, I guess we just won't do it.
Come on, I'll walk you out.

543
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,768
Wait. What? Sorry. You what? Jack?

544
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:24,410
Uh... Sorry, I don't understand.
You're not gonna take the job?

545
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,601
Not if you're not.

546
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,729
Without you handling the tech,
I don't see how this company works.

547
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,243
Wow. I mean, yeah, I agree.

548
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:36,287
Richard, it's hard enough running a business
when everyone is on the same page.

549
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,408
And clearly, we are not.

550
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,284
- Well, yeah...
- No, no, it's fine,

551
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,011
and I appreciate you being so honest with me.

552
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,929
I mean, better we find out now, right?

553
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,326
Yeah.

554
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,402
Anyway, I hope we each find
a good fit somewhere.

555
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,361
Thanks for coming up.

556
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,006
You got a hell of a brain there,
Richard Hendricks.

557
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,206
You drive safe.

558
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,527
Yeah.

559
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,241
Shit.
