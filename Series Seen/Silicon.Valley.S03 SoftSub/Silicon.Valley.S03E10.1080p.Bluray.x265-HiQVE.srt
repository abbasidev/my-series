1
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,161
How the fuck does
something like this happen?

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,802
How does an elephant just die?

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,044
He was very old and depressed.

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,409
He'd recently been rescued from the circus,

5
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,370
but as it turns out,
he actually really loved performing.

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,249
Who gives a fuck about the elephant?

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,285
What about me? This does not look good.

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,931
I'm having a bit of trouble
figuring out how to remove him.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,526
- He weighs 9,000 pounds.
- Cut it up.

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,725
Take it out in pieces.

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,486
I don't mean to interrupt,
but I could call in a personal favor

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,161
and get a helo crew out of Travis AFB
with a Sikorsky Skycrane to airlift it out

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,765
and drop it in the ocean right after dark.

14
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,645
No muss, no fuss.

15
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,643
There. Was that so hard, Patrice?
Because Hoover sure didn't think so.

16
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,803
I mean, I just found my footing again,

17
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,323
and you put me in danger of losing it all
over some fucking elephant?

18
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,928
Gavin, you always said that here at Hooli,

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,891
in order to achieve greatness,
we must first achieve goodness.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,161
Right.

21
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,164
- So?
- So...

22
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,247
I was a bridesmaid at Sean Parker's wedding

23
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,244
when he handed out live bunnies
as plush toys.

24
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,641
That wasn't goodness.

25
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,246
It was badness.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,001
And so is this.

27
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,327
You're using endangered animals
just to make points at board meetings.

28
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,131
I'm drawing thoughtful,
zoological comparisons.

29
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,969
But couldn't you just show them
a picture of these animals?

30
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,044
A simple Hooli search
would yield thousands of choices.

31
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,966
Patrice, I thank you for your honesty,
and I will repay you with my own.

32
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,402
I honestly never want to see you
in my offices again.

33
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,921
You're fired.

34
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,565
- Hoover, scramble that Skycrane.
- Yes, sir.

35
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,011
Please, come in. Come in. Have a seat.

36
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,965
I won't take a lot of your time. I promise.

37
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,528
- Okay.
- Would you like some tea?

38
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,405
I can put a kettle on the hot plate.

39
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,125
- Oh, no, I'm fine. Thank you.
- There's no trouble.

40
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,487
You know what,
I have a box of Russell Stovers

41
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,850
-if the spiders didn't get into 'em.
- Jared, is this about the fake users?

42
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,241
You know?

43
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,403
Two days ago, I wanted to look at
user behavior to figure out

44
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,529
what spurred the sudden uptick,
and well, I noticed something.

45
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,561
Almost all of our new users were
just uploading a single photo

46
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,766
into a shared folder,

47
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,003
and then the next day,
they would take the photo out

48
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,402
and then put it back in
the day after that and that's it.

49
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,406
You know, just enough to qualify
as a daily active user.

50
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,005
Classic click-farm behavior.

51
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,684
And then I remembered our conversation
in the bathtub,

52
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,762
and it just had to be you.

53
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,242
Richard, I am so sorry.

54
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,250
- It's okay.
- Would it make you feel better to...

55
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,049
-...to strike me?
- No.

56
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,691
You had good intentions, Jared.
Honestly, don't give it another thought.

57
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,125
Just, you know...

58
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,447
You and I right now are the only ones
that know about it, okay?

59
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,123
And in a few weeks,
when we run out of money,

60
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,486
this will all be over anyway.

61
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,768
- Richard?
- Yes?

62
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,125
We have a secret.

63
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,886
Yeah.

64
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,966
I mean, I swear to God,

65
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,486
your dicks would have blown
out of the back of your assholes

66
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,369
if you had been there, hand to God.

67
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,683
- Hey, guys. What's going on?
- Richard, sit down. I did it.

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,490
I saved the company.

69
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,450
What do you... What? How?

70
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,049
- Jared, have you been crying?
- Yes, but for ordinary reasons.

71
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,885
- Please, go on.
- Okay.

72
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,450
I was at The Rosewood for lunch.

73
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,046
I mean, it was the lunch hour.
I was there, I wasn't eating, the usual.

74
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,407
So, I walk over to Andreessen
and I say something funny,

75
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,528
but he stone-faces me.

76
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,287
What did you say?

77
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,362
It doesn't matter.
The point is, it was hilarious,

78
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,886
but he gave me nothing
and neither did his friends.

79
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,243
Then I realized why.

80
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,810
- You're not funny?
- No, Gilfoyle, but that is.

81
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,007
No, it's that everybody thinks
Pied Piper is in this death spiral,

82
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,321
so it would be inappropriate to laugh
at my hysterical joke.

83
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,961
And it hits me.

84
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,211
I know something that they don't.

85
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,768
I know about the uptick.

86
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,688
- The uptick?
- Yes, the uptick.

87
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,442
- The recent sudden surge in users.
- Oh, yeah. That.

88
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,251
Yes, that. So, while our fortune is rising,

89
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,044
everybody else thinks that it's plummeting,

90
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,090
and I can use these opposing forces

91
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,523
to a multiplying effect like a slingshot,
and then I make a decision.

92
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,687
I'm gonna make a move.

93
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,529
So, I say something cryptic about the uptick,
and I walk away.

94
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,842
- What did you say?
- I don't know. I can't remember.

95
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,611
But I walk over and I see
McNamee's having the short rib,

96
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,648
which I hear is delicious but not too heavy,

97
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,846
and then I say to him,

98
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,491
"You're gonna have to tuck in your tie-dye
if you want to eat here."

99
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,649
- How's that relevant?
-It's not.

100
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,200
But the people that I just walked away from
don't know that.

101
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,410
All they know is that I'm over there
exchanging witty banter with McNamee,

102
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,931
and about what, they don't know.

103
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,729
It's all that they do want to know.

104
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,804
And then, it settles in.

105
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,726
FOMO.

106
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,809
The fear of missing out.

107
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,202
Suddenly, it feels like time is slowing down.

108
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,851
I could see every move I was going to make,
12 steps ahead.

109
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,571
It was like I was Bobby Fischer
if he could really fuck.

110
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,722
I go outside,
I walk across the street to Greylock,

111
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,086
I check in on Instagram,

112
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,925
Vinod Khosla calls me,
asks me what I doing there.

113
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,401
I say, "I can't talk right now.
Call me at Wood Opal."

114
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,641
Well, he does, and then suddenly
Wood Opal is going,

115
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,041
"What's Khosla got going on with Bachman?"

116
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,771
Meanwhile, I'm taking a leak
at a Restoration Hardware.

117
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,649
I jack off a little bit. I don't cum.

118
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,690
And then it snowballs.

119
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,925
I deftly played Ross Lorna
against Index Ventures.

120
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,890
And because of that, the big kahuna bites.

121
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,161
Sequoia.

122
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,847
I spend the next 20 minutes
denying calls from Jim Goetz,

123
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,331
over and over.

124
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,846
And yes, I'm jacking off,
but I don't need to ejaculate

125
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,400
because by the time I listen to the messages,

126
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,929
I've got offers, I've got counters,
I've got counter-counters.

127
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,327
I cum.

128
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,000
When the dust settled,

129
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,809
and the losers went home,
all that was left was this.

130
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,041
"Hello, Mr. Bachman.

131
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,126
"Coleman Blair Partners
would like to offer Pied Piper

132
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,921
"a Series B round of $6 million

133
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,810
"on a $60 million valuation."

134
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,841
Oh.

135
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,401
Yeah.

136
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,050
Holy shit.

137
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,881
And this asshole wanted
to pivot to video-chat.

138
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,086
Still valid.

139
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,521
Although less sexy now, I'll concede that.

140
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,806
<i>It's my Mona Lisa.</i>

141
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,163
And the entire cornerstone

142
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,530
upon which I built
this motherfucking cathedral

143
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,648
that I will forever be remembered for

144
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,884
was this beautiful little uptick.

145
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,929
I think I have a bottle
of Cold Duck in the crisper.

146
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,331
Who's drinking? Come on!

147
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,050
I got a bottle of Martinelli's for you, Jared.

148
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,600
This is a big day!

149
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,769
We did it! Yes!

150
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,524
- Are there any wine coolers?
- I'll talk to him.

151
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,726
I'll talk 110 him.

152
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,691
Here's my Hooli badge.

153
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,044
And I have a hanging tag

154
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,168
on my rear-view mirror
for the parking structure.

155
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,730
- Can I just mail that in?
- No, you need to go get that now.

156
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,760
Okay.

157
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,806
Hey, Dinesh.

158
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,121
I'm just looking for Erlich.
Have you seen him?

159
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,646
Oh, he went to the liquor store.
Gotta keep the party going, you know?

160
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,563
Oh, yeah. Yeah, Series B. Crazy, right?

161
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,846
- Oh, it's unreal.
- Yeah.

162
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,522
Almost like some of our users.

163
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,961
What?

164
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,289
- What does that mean?
- Oh, "Unreal" has so many meanings.

165
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,408
Fake, paid for,

166
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,370
one person in Bangladesh
pretending to be 6,000.

167
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,570
Okay. Uh...

168
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,726
- All right, Dinesh...
- Oh, no.

169
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,971
I don't want to know a fucking thing.

170
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,886
Okay then. Great.

171
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,128
I won't tell you anything
because nothing happened.

172
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,403
- Great.
- Okay.

173
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,322
But if something did happen,
and we're not saying it did,

174
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,845
the fact remains

175
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,888
that leaves us in
a very advantageous position.

176
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,689
There's a lot of money on the table.

177
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,569
And it would be a shame if that went away.

178
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,801
You know what else
would be a shame...

179
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,369
ls if I couldn't find my flash drive.
Gilfoyle, have you seen my flash drive?

180
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,841
Right, the one with the zombie script on it?

181
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,163
Why, yes, the zombie script
that randomizes user action

182
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,129
in platforms such as Pied Piper.

183
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,647
You mean so that
fake users and click farms would be

184
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,371
absolutely indistinguishable from real users?

185
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,646
Oh, I suppose.

186
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,768
I mean, especially during due diligence,

187
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,571
like the kind done by VCs
or possible future reviews

188
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,411
done by certain regulatory bodies.

189
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,282
It also had photos of my auntie.

190
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,491
- Anyway, Gilfoyle, have you seen it?
- I have not.

191
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,770
Hmm. Well, Richard,
keep an eye out for it, will ya?

192
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,842
Hey, Gilfoyle, you wanna come inside
and help me get a new flash drive

193
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,402
-on www.staples.com?
-Yeah, I think...

194
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,970
-...we're sort of done with the ruse.
- Okay.

195
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,283
Okay, fine.
Well, whatever you did or didn't do,

196
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,400
- that was serial-killer-level shit.
- Agreed.

197
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,962
I think I finally respect you as a CEO.

198
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,641
Fuck.

199
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,005
- This is fraud.
- Is it?

200
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,523
I mean, our platform does
exactly what we say it does.

201
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,443
Okay? It's not like we're lying about it
like fucking Theranos.

202
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,127
And if our platform works,
which we know it will,

203
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,204
we will make them billions of dollars.

204
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,567
Everybody wins, Jared.
You still believe that, right?

205
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,689
That, if given enough time,
the platform will catch on?

206
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,931
Richard, don't weaponize my faith in you
against me.

207
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,890
Your faith made all this possible.

208
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,407
It's wrong.

209
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,289
Well, every time I try to do the right thing,
I get fucked.

210
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,086
And if I do the right thing here,

211
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,006
we're done. That's it.

212
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,650
Doesn't seem like much of an option, does it?

213
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,848
Dang, they're all just so good.

214
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,202
<i><i>Gavin, CJ Cantwell, line one.</i>

215
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,370
Dang, let's pick this up tomorrow.

216
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,569
- CJ.
- I'm finishing a story I'd love a comment on.

217
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,089
It's about the death of an unpermitted
Indian elephant named Maurice,

218
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,323
in your sculpture garden
and its subsequent illegal dumping

219
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,731
in the San Francisco Bay.

220
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,128
- That's preposterous.
- Mmm, I have a very good source.

221
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,405
What do you propose we do here?

222
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,246
<i>Well, I have one idea.</i>

223
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,410
<i>And what, pray tell, might that be?</i>

224
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,887
CJ sold the blog for $2 million.

225
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,769
No shit.

226
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,606
Bachmanity rides again.

227
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,011
Well, not exactly.

228
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,683
Uh, I called Big Head to tell him that
our share was worth half a mil each,

229
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:22,443
and not five minutes later,
his father, one Nelson Bighetti Sr.,

230
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,803
called me and explained that
I was never to have

231
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,283
any financial dealings with his son
in perpetuity, ever,

232
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,363
or he would get very Italian on me.

233
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,202
And I'm not interested
to find out what that means.

234
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,088
- Okay. Shall we?
- To Coleman Blair! Let's close this fucker.

235
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,321
Good luck, fellas.

236
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,207
Remember, you just sit there and look pretty.

237
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,530
Leave all the talking to me.

238
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,764
And if you mention my Montblanc,
then don't make it overt, like I told you to.

239
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,921
But do.

240
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,121
Oh.

241
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,767
Hey, what's up?

242
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,888
Are you guys out raising money
from someone else?

243
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,047
Oh, Monica,
it's kind of a long story.

244
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,281
Why are you whispering?

245
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,209
Oh, my God,
you're there right now, aren't you?

246
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,251
Jesus! Do you have any idea

247
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,243
how big of an asshole
you're making me look here?

248
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,527
Laurie just lost her shit at me, okay?

249
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,921
So, you need to turn around
and walk the hell out of there.

250
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,528
Erlich put all this together.
I really had nothing to do with it.

251
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,843
You have everything to do with it.
You're the fucking CEO, Richard.

252
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,890
<i>Whatever your company does is 100% on you.</i>

253
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,201
Gentlemen.

254
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,087
- They're ready for you.
- Oh. Yes. I gotta go.

255
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,288
Do not hang up on me. Richard, do not...

256
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,565
So listen, we're pumped, guys.

257
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,689
We're thrilled to be getting into Pied Piper
right at this inflection point.

258
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,565
- It's very exciting.
- We are pumped as well. Aren't we, Richard?

259
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,850
- Richard. Pumped.
- Hmm? Pumped.

260
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,127
- We are pumped up.
- Pumped up. Mmm-hmm.

261
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,283
So we'll just need
your John Hancock right here.

262
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,842
Oh, sure, Richard. You can use my Montblanc.

263
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,650
Oh, the, uh...

264
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:23,129
This is an actual term sheet.
And once I sign this... That's it, right?

265
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,531
Yup. No turning back.

266
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,291
You can have your lawyers vet
the actual stock purchase agreement

267
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,045
once we close here just to make sure
no one is pulling any funny business.

268
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,771
- No, no.
- No, my lawyer is in jail, so.

269
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,647
So.

270
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,084
Oh, my God. I, uh...

271
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,205
Wow, I can't believe
I didn't think of this before,

272
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,688
because, well, let me put it to you this way.

273
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,606
What would you say if I told you that
the same compression that you know and love

274
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,889
is being used in a world-beating,
game-changing, wait for it...

275
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,488
Video-conferencing application?

276
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,282
Wouldn't that be interesting?

277
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,683
- What?
- You mean like Hooli-Chat?

278
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,206
This will be far superior to Hooli-Chat.

279
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,044
You may want to fund that instead.

280
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,170
In fact, why don't I just go home,
I'll grab my laptop,

281
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,890
I'll come back here, I'll show it to you guys.

282
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,450
- It's not that far. I don't mind...
- Richard...

283
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,931
- I'll tell you what, I'll grab an Uber.
- No, no, no.

284
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,048
- It's no problem.
- Richard, what the fuck are you doing?

285
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,087
There. I've ordered it.

286
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,367
Neal is in a blue Kia Sportage
and he's right around the corner.

287
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,680
All right, all right. Look, look, look.

288
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,047
I don't know who else you're talking to
about the platform,

289
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,011
but I'm willing to go up to
seven million on 70.

290
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,447
Okay? But that's it.
You sign this thing, right here, right now.

291
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,724
Bravo, Richard. Nice neg.

292
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,321
Now sign it.

293
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,131
Thank you. Very generous of you.

294
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,043
I just want to make sure that
you're aware of all the feedback

295
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,043
'cause we had some focus groups
and there were some issues.

296
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,525
Just so you're clear,

297
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,731
people have been wondering,
"Ah! Where are my files?

298
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,246
- Richard, Richard...
- "Zero K used? Where's the download button?

299
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,970
-"The Terminator..."
- All right, all right, you know what?

300
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,929
-'Cause it...
- I'm gonna sign it. Can I sign it? I'll sign it.

301
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,004
You can if you want,
but we still need his signature.

302
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,885
Richard, sign it.

303
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,084
That's two years of runway.

304
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,691
- Sign it now!
- I can't.

305
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,522
- Why the fuck not?
- Because the numbers are fake.

306
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,041
What?

307
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,683
- What? What do you mean? What do you...
- We bought...

308
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,124
Fake users from a Bangladeshi click farm.

309
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,566
The uptick was fake.

310
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,807
But the vid-chat...

311
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,281
...is real.

312
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,126
Erlich, the fake users were
just meant to cheer the guys up.

313
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,850
I had no idea you were
gonna take those numbers...

314
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,246
And what, and go do my fucking job?

315
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,448
Pour everything I had
into getting the best possible

316
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,648
deal for Pied Piper because I believe in them?

317
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,360
Well, that's all over now.

318
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,807
Richard, we are fucked!

319
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,688
In the amount of time that it took for us to get
from that office to right here,

320
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,603
every VC in the Valley knows about this.

321
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,126
If I signed those term sheets,
I would be committing fraud.

322
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,440
That's a fucking crime.

323
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,846
You're saying you wanted me to...

324
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,843
No, I wanted you to fucking think about that

325
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,922
before you paraded me
around the whole fucking Valley

326
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,445
to sell your lie.

327
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,364
And then suddenly grew
a thick, girthy conscience

328
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,521
and fucked me with it.

329
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,647
Are you Richard?

330
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,925
- Did you order an Uber?
- Oh, no.

331
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,011
All you had to do was
keep your fucking mouth shut

332
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,525
and sign that piece of paper.

333
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,924
We would have fixed it afterwards.

334
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,245
But you didn't. You caked your pants.

335
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,328
No, better yet, you caked my pants.
Fuck you, Richard Hendricks.

336
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,526
Fuck you.

337
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,844
Richard Hendricks, huh?

338
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,251
Prick.

339
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,971
- Hey.
- Oh, hey, Monica.

340
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,647
Is Richard here? I heard what happened,
but he's not answering any of my calls.

341
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,449
We just wanted you to know for the record

342
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,842
that we had no idea
any of that stuff was going on.

343
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,570
Still trying to wrap our heads around it.

344
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,806
Point is, don't beat yourself up
about not seeing it.

345
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,689
I'm not beating myself up...

346
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,922
I hope you don't think
we're guilty by association,

347
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,526
because then we would have to think
you're guilty by association.

348
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,761
Which We don't.

349
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,207
Just want to let you know
that we would definitely work

350
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,725
with you again in the future.

351
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,962
It's good to know, guys. Thanks.

352
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,280
Um, is he in his room?

353
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,488
I mean, he said he was.

354
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,961
But...

355
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,244
I'm gonna go to his room.

356
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,407
Mmm-hmm.

357
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,841
Ugh!

358
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,241
What's up, Gleb?

359
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,567
<i>I hear Richard shit bed, huh?</i>

360
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,484
<i>So, the platform is no---</i></i>

361
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,962
Fuck, now the vid-chat's fucking up.

362
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,241
Odd, considering who wrote the code for it.

363
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,482
Not the code. The server is overloaded.

364
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,201
How is that possible?
We only gave it to, like, 12 people.

365
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,291
Well, there's a few more than that
using it now.

366
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,447
Holy shit.

367
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,331
For what it's worth, Richard,
I think you did the right thing.

368
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,765
And I can see now why you didn't
want to come to us for funding.

369
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,285
You were trying to protect us.

370
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,846
Yeah.

371
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,690
Well, I really appreciate it.

372
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,841
Uh...

373
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,206
Laurie wants out.

374
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,083
Even a whiff of fraud is a mortal sin for VCs.

375
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,007
She needs to wash her hands
of any Pied Piper business.

376
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,481
She's forcing a sale.

377
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,321
Fuck.

378
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,045
Yeah, frick.

379
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,001
Yeah.

380
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,451
But it is an open auction,

381
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,648
and, you know,
between the fraudulent numbers

382
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,451
and the real numbers,

383
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,443
you guys aren't exactly killing it out there.

384
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,682
So, there is a chance that no one will bid

385
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,489
and you might be able to
buy back your own company

386
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,721
for next to nothing.

387
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,765
That will have to be for literally nothing
because we're out of money.

388
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,681
Ow!

389
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,371
Jesus! Are you okay?

390
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,846
Yeah, we're fine.

391
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,802
All right, I spun together a few more servers.
That should handle the traffic.

392
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,641
Look at this.
There are 157 people using it near Gleb.

393
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,371
And 400 people using it near Tara in Boston.

394
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,888
Yeah, I told her to give it to
her Satanist friends out there.

395
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,526
Looks like she did.

396
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,171
She knows 400 Satanists in Boston?

397
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,687
The Catholic church really did
a number on that town.

398
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,088
Hey, Erlich, remember when Gilfoyle said that
my video-chat app was a piece of shit

399
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,685
and that nobody would ever use it?

400
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,243
Well, he was wrong. Over 4,000 times. Tsk.

401
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,530
Wow. And you developed that
with the Pied Piper IP, right?

402
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,765
Well, then you can kiss that goodbye.

403
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,161
Oh, fuck.

404
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,928
Speaking of, I'm actually using
the first dollars of my blog windfall

405
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,128
on a trip to Kainchi Dham Ashram

406
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,009
in Nainital, India,

407
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:41,563
where Steve Jobs famously sought peace
and came up with the idea

408
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,449
for a little product he called

409
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,967
the Lisa.

410
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,807
Good luck.

411
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,123
Richard, I'll expect you off the premises
by end of day.

412
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,125
Monica.

413
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,845
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

414
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,049
You know, you can stay here for one year.

415
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,528
- Free rent.
- Jian-Yang!

416
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,001
Laurie.

417
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,321
Oh.

418
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,161
Gavin.

419
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,480
You know Jack, of course.

420
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,611
That is correct.

421
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,521
Gavin, can we address
the elephant in the room?

422
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,729
- Sorry?
- Pied Piper.

423
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,243
Right. Yes, of course.

424
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,322
I am forcing a sale.

425
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,930
Your Maleant dealings demonstrate
that you're still pursuing middle-out.

426
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,929
Might you be interested in placing a bid?

427
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,963
Why would he want to bail out Raviga?

428
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,328
You said it yourself,
our compression play is thriving.

429
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,844
- Fair enough.
- You know what? I'm a completionist.

430
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:45,166
Even if I buy it just to throw it in the garbage,
I'd like to be the one to drive the final nail

431
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,526
in the Hendricks coffin.

432
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,846
I'll give you...

433
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,645
Nine hundred dollars for it?

434
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,243
- I believe that is a joke.
- You know what?

435
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,284
I like nice, round numbers.

436
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,246
Make it...

437
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,486
A million?

438
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,486
A million dollars?

439
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:05,281
Gavin Belson gets to buy
Pied Piper for a million dollars

440
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,250
and Raviga gets all of it because
of their liquidation preference

441
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,446
and I get jack shit?

442
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,363
Is that what you're telling me? God damn it.

443
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,087
<i>I know this is the last way
that you wanted it to end.</i>

444
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,561
<i>I'm really sorry.</i>

445
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,927
Yeah, well, I'll see you at the meeting.

446
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,766
Is that Hooli-Chat?

447
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,282
They fix it or something?
That didn't look shitty at all.

448
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,404
Actually, it's ours.
The guys hacked it together.

449
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,245
- I can send you an invite if you want.
- Yeah. Cool. Thanks.

450
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,449
- We got up to 4K users totally organically.
- Oh.

451
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,244
Oh, shit, 7K now.

452
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,560
Wow, we should have been
focusing on this instead.

453
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,807
Not that it matters.

454
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,724
I mean, it's all gonna be property
of Gavin Belson in an hour, so.

455
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,400
That's ironic, huh?

456
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,050
No, for real, I'm asking. Is it?

457
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,160
I don't know. I was just smiling.

458
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,967
Feels ironic.

459
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,729
Hey, so thank you for...

460
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,844
- Letting me stay here.
- No worries.

461
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,928
Steve says you're welcome to
take my spot on the couch

462
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,571
until you can find a job
and get your own place.

463
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,846
Thanks.

464
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,287
So, when's your dad coming to pick you up?

465
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,366
A couple of hours, I guess.

466
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,330
Then we're turning right around
and going back to Phoenix.

467
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,166
You know, he said he wants to be able
to keep an eye on me and my money

468
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:17,006
and that I need to get a real job
to learn the value of a hard day's night

469
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,445
or something like that.

470
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,971
Well, I should probably get going
to this board meeting.

471
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,604
And you're probably gonna be gone
when I'm back, so...

472
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,649
- Guess this is it.
- Yeah, I guess so.

473
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,087
See ya.

474
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,521
Oh...

475
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,765
-Okay.
-Okay.

476
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,888
- All right. Cool, man.
- There we go.

477
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,526
Richard, even though
it's the last board meeting

478
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,364
and essentially meaningless,

479
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,045
thank you for letting me be a part of it.
It's an honor.

480
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,204
Okay, you don't have to keep saying that.

481
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,644
Good day, all. This should be brief.

482
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,647
The only item on the agenda is,
of course, the authorization

483
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,529
of the sale of Pied Piper
to the current high bidder.

484
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,409
Three "yes" votes will approve the sale.

485
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,131
And as Raviga controls
three of the board seats,

486
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,571
-it seems...
- I'm sorry.

487
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,842
- I'm not doing it.
- Oh, Monica, not again.

488
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,321
I'm sorry, but look,
Richard has worked too hard

489
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,562
and I know that I can't stop it,
but I'm not gonna vote

490
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,041
to let Pied Piper become
the property of that asshole.

491
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,602
Monica, I also happen
to find him contemptible.

492
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,651
But Pied Piper will be sold
to the high bidder, period.

493
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,000
You know what? I don't care.

494
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,085
You want to fire me, fire me.

495
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,687
If we're not gonna adhere to the values
that Peter Gregory instilled,

496
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,401
-then I don't think I belong here.
- Monica, you don't have to do this.

497
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,602
- I'm not voting yes.
- Very well. You're off the board.

498
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,444
Excuse me. Man.

499
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,766
- Do you work here?
- Well, it was my first day actually.

500
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,524
- Everybody's been super...
- Sit.

501
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,490
You are now officially on
the board of directors of Pied Piper.

502
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,925
- Oh, okay. That's fine I guess...
- When I point to you, you will vote yes.

503
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,207
Now, I move to vote on the sale of Pied Piper.

504
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,646
I vote yes.

505
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,847
- I vote yes.
- And Evan.

506
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,281
Evan?

507
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,127
- I can't do it.
- What? Why?

508
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,726
Because“.

509
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,081
Monica?

510
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,566
I love you.

511
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,130
There. I said it.

512
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,325
And I could never do anything
to make you sad.

513
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,801
Oh, for fuck's sake.
Do I have to pull the receptionist in here?

514
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,882
How does this compare
with a typical board meeting?

515
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,770
All right, stop. Everybody, just stop.

516
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,888
We all know how this is gonna go,
so let's just get it over with.

517
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,007
All right?

518
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,571
I vote yes. There. Okay? I approve the sale.

519
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,400
Three "yes" votes.
Can this please just be done?

520
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,721
Very well.

521
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,370
- I vote yes also.
-Irrelevant.

522
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,721
- But thank you.
- The sale is approved.

523
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,121
Pied Piper, its IP, and all of its assets

524
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,806
are now officially the property
of Bachmanity, LLC.

525
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,768
Wait, sorry, did...

526
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,243
Did you just say "Bachmanity"?

527
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,161
- As in Erlich Bachman and Nelson Bighetti?
- Yes, you know them.

528
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,441
Wait, they had the highest bid?

529
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,369
I received a telephone call
approximately 30 minutes ago

530
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,683
entering a bid of one million and one dollars
with a firm no-shop clause.

531
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,003
So, when you were referring to
the person who bought Pied Piper

532
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,971
as a contemptible asshole,
you were talking about Erlich?

533
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,923
To which contemptible asshole
did you think I was referring?

534
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,521
Gavin Belson.

535
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,961
Oh.

536
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,930
I see. No.

537
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,083
This meeting is adjourned.
I thank you all for your time.

538
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,251
So, Bachmanity it is.

539
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,331
That's good.

540
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,651
So, should we give this thing a shot?

541
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,970
You and Big Head, huh?

542
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,561
Um...

543
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,401
Sorry you had to cancel your trip.

544
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,801
And look, I really appreciate all this.

545
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,881
I really think this video-chat thing
is gonna be something, you know?

546
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,008
- I don't know if you've seen the numbers.
- You want a number?

547
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,446
The percentage I give a fuck about you, zero.

548
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,841
It's trending steady.

549
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,770
And of course I've seen the numbers.

550
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,722
This is a business opportunity. Nothing more.

551
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,289
Big Head was your friend.
He was the one that talked me into it.

552
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,490
I don't trust you, Richard Hendricks.

553
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:40,763
And it's gonna take a long, long, long time
to regain my trust.

554
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,361
Are we clear?

555
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,410
Are we absolutely clear...

556
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,689
Always blue! Always blue!
Always blue! Always blue!

557
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,444
Always blue! Always blue!

558
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,681
Always blue!

559
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,529
- You suck.
- Oh, fuck, it's my dad again.

560
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,770
He's gotta be so pissed.
I can't believe this is happening, you guys.

561
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,968
I mean, I guess now
we're a video-chat company,

562
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,168
but the best part of it is it's us, you know?

563
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,129
Just us controlling our own destiny.

564
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,044
No, the best part of it is that I own 50%.

565
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,529
Well, yes, you and Big Head
do own the entire company,

566
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,489
but I am the founder, it's my algorithm,

567
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,881
so I'm assuming I'm getting
my original shares back, right?

568
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,450
Why would you assume that?

569
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:24,002
Well, when a tech company reboots,
it's normal to have a conversation

570
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,849
about restructuring the cap table.

571
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,003
Good, 'cause I'm the guy that hacked together
the video-chat app

572
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,082
to see if that woman was hot, so...

573
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:35,166
Yeah, but it's not gonna scale until
I get in there and scrape all the Dinesh off.

574
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,369
Well, Laurie still hasn't called me back,
so I may need a new job.

575
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,605
And I'm assuming Pied Piper
can't afford my salary,

576
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,085
so I'll need stock.

577
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,209
Do we really want it to be called
Pied Piper anymore?

578
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,362
No, yes, of course. Of course we want...

579
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,169
Why do we want to change the name?
It's great.

580
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,481
Yeah, and we do already have the jackets.

581
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,086
Big. Head.

582
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,601
Big Head.

583
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,807
Go for Erlich.

584
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,884
Erlich Bachman, this is you as an old man.

585
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,082
I'm ugly and I'm dead. Alone.

586
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,406
I'm gonna let him have this one. All right...

587
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,450
Well, I'm sorry to hear that, future me.
What a terrible thing.

588
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,090
I'll talk to you in several years.

589
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,207
You're up.

590
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,203
Always blue! Always blue!

591
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:23,365
Always blue! Always blue!

592
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,171
Always blue! Always blue! Always blue!

593
