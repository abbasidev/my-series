1
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,570
Shit. I swear I deleted a picture,

2
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:19,726
but when I clicked back to the album,
the icon reappeared, it undeleted itself.

3
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,041
But I can't get it to happen again, so...

4
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,849
Hey, Richard, totally out of the blue,

5
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,928
do you know how
we might be able to find that bug?

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,209
No, Dinesh. We are not releasing the beta.

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,489
We integrated the neural net a week ago.
The platform is full of bugs.

8
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,086
But that is what a beta is for.

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,291
You give it to people in the real world,
they use it, and that is how we find the bugs.

10
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,283
Richard, Reid Hoffman says

11
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,204
if you're not mortally embarrassed
by the quality of your initial release,

12
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,566
you've released too late.

13
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,371
Okay. We already are mortally embarrassed.

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,126
Okay? We move in
and, subsequently, out of our offices,

15
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,049
mainly because it was too expensive.

16
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,284
We fired two CEOs, we've pivoted to a box,
and then pivoted back.

17
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,807
Any more bad word-of-mouth
and we will be royally fucked.

18
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,765
Where's Gilfoyle?

19
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,611
Hey, Gilfoyle, the deletion issue
is ducking me again, and, um...

20
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,727
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,001
<i>Well, hey, Richard.</i>

22
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,646
Hi, Tara.

23
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,569
I need to borrow your fella here for a second.

24
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,330
All right, babe, I gotta go.

25
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,603
Hey, when you check out the settings view,

26
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,091
can you let me know
if there's something weird

27
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,366
that happens with the submit button?

28
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,841
It was a little weird when I was doing QA.

29
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,921
<i>Yeah, okay.</i>

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,129
- Sorry, the settings view for...
- The beta.

31
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,487
- The beta for...
- Pied Piper.

32
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,803
It's a promising compression company
that doesn't pay very well.

33
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,291
- You sent her the beta?
- I did.

34
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,443
Are you fucking insane?
It's not ready. It's riddled with bugs.

35
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,922
<i>Really? Cause I've been test-driving it all day,
and it's pretty fucking awesome.</i>

36
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,767
Really? You think so?

37
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,365
Yeah. For real.

38
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,408
<i>Congratulations, Richard. It's so fucking cool.</i>

39
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,562
<i>And when the neural net kicks in,
it's gonna be rad.</i>

40
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,483
<i>But, you know,
I did have one problem, though.</i>

41
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,564
<i>I tried to restore an old file
and it asked me to confirm twice.</i>

42
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,449
Yeah, well, that was a bad merge.

43
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,205
It's been there for months.
I fixed it in 10 seconds.

44
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,370
Richard...

45
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,801
Maybe.

46
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,690
Yeah, maybe beta.

47
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,160
<i>- Hi, Dinesh.
Java.</i>

48
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,725
Wait, that can't be right.

49
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,802
How can Bachmanity
still be so far in the hole?

50
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,564
Look at all this shit that Big Head is selling.

51
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,563
He was renting
virtually everything in the house.

52
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,685
He rented that cannon?

53
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,325
It was for display purposes only.
So you forfeit your deposit.

54
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,165
It's a cannon.
What's he supposed to do, not fire it?

55
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,526
That was the provision.

56
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,005
So that's it then, I guess.

57
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,570
Big Head's really broke.

58
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,364
You know what? He's young. He'll get past it.

59
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,801
Nelson is not the only one
who should be worried.

60
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,882
- You were partners.
- Fair point.

61
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:59,249
But shuttering a company in the tech world
is almost a rite of passage,

62
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,606
like herpes simplex one.

63
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,481
At first, it's ugly and embarrassing
and you're disgusted by your own dick.

64
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,200
But after a while,

65
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,521
in the larger scheme of things,
you realize it's really...

66
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,729
Mr. Bachman, you structured Bachmanity
as a general partnership.

67
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,601
Then, with no money in the bank,
you threw a million-dollar luau on Alcatraz.

68
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,920
You're on the hook for that.

69
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,046
And even declaring bankruptcy
isn't going to absolve you of these debts.

70
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,724
Bankruptcy?

71
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,370
it's none of my business. Good luck.

72
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,250
Wait, where are you going?
We need you. You're our business manager.

73
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,607
There's no business remaining to manage.

74
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,966
Good day, Mr. Bachman.

75
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,766
Hey, good news.

76
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,569
They said we can each
keep one of the cannonballs,

77
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,449
so not a total loss, right?

78
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,571
All right, so I've set up
a sign-up page for the beta.

79
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,120
Now, we're gonna keep it small and secure,

80
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,171
so that means we're limited
to 10 invite codes each to send out.

81
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,126
I've already got my list.

82
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,043
It's people that I know personally,

83
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,370
and people that I know I can trust.

84
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,887
Hmm, we only get 10 each.
This could be prickly.

85
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,008
Well, I'm out. I don't trust anyone.

86
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,764
It's a huge part of my belief system.

87
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,047
You sent the beta to Tara.

88
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,771
Yeah, there was a transactional nature
to that exchange,

89
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,968
-which I'll get into if you want.
- Pass.

90
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,123
But it doesn't mean that I trust her,
and I certainly don't trust anyone else.

91
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,608
Oh, in other words, you have no friends.

92
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,681
On principle.

93
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,721
I could make what rises to your low
standards of a friend any time I want.

94
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,847
Sure you could.

95
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,561
Gilfoyle, if you're not gonna use your 10
invites, could Dinesh and I have them?

96
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,450
Sure. Knock yourselves out.

97
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,124
Loser. He's got no friends.

98
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,040
Okay.

99
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,600
Miriam, Sylvia...

100
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,447
Oh, Samantha!
I almost forgot her.

101
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,922
You know, Jared, you can have
all 10 of Gilfoyle's invites.

102
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,726
- Much appreciated.
- Yeah.

103
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,850
Monica, hello.

104
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,651
Um, did you honestly think that you could
send me an email

105
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,406
telling me that you were launching the beta
without sending me the beta?

106
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,925
<i>Come on. I'm dying to see it.</i>

107
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,571
Well, I think the whole point, Monica,
is to get the beta

108
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,290
into the hands of unbiased people

109
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,647
so they can give us an honest feedback,
you know.

110
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,802
Besides, I just gave out my 10 invites.

111
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,930
Oh, if Monica wants an invite,
I could, like, squeeze her on my list.

112
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,048
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, no problem.

113
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,009
Okay, Monica, well, you're in luck.

114
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,845
Dinesh has decided to give you
one of his codes, so...

115
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,651
Great. I promise I'll find
something terrible to say.

116
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,805
Okay, so I did a rough accounting

117
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,281
of your assets and liabilities.

118
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,886
Jared, don't look at me like that.
Just give it to me straight.

119
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,885
All right. Your house has appreciated
in value since you bought it,

120
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,646
but if you sold it now
for what Zillow and Redfin think it's worth...

121
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,449
I'd still be half a million in the hole.

122
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,648
Now, that's the bad news.

123
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,891
- Is there good news?
- Well, it's unclear.

124
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,531
I went back through your records.

125
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,208
Uh, at first, I'll admit, a bit voyeuristically,
uh, to see where all of the money went,

126
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,204
and apart from the party expenses,
which were staggering...

127
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,281
Yeah. Fuck, yeah.

128
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,010
But one number jumped out at me.

129
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,204
Now, whoever did your accounting

130
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,683
earmarked almost 70%
of Big Head's settlement money for taxes.

131
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,520
70%?

132
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,730
Even in Taxo-Alto, which I coined,
it would be half that.

133
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,040
Where did that money go?

134
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,442
Well, that is the $6-million question.

135
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,045
I may have the answer.

136
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,926
I'm sorry. You're accusing me of impropriety?

137
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,728
You, the man who spent $20,000

138
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,565
renting giant fiberglass tiki heads,

139
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,001
and $40,000 more

140
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,926
when one of them was misplaced
on the way back to the rental house?

141
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,083
I told you it wasn't misplaced.
I know exactly where it is.

142
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,242
It's at the bottom of the bay.

143
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:53,086
I called you a thief because
you, sir, have stolen from us.

144
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,004
Nelson, come on.
You can't possibly believe this.

145
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,041
- Sorry.
- Don't apologize to him.

146
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,770
- Oh, right. Sorry.
- Thank you.

147
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,207
Arthur, you listen to me, and you listen good.

148
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,762
I have people calling me 40 times a day
asking for their money.

149
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,486
I even considered
selling my house to pay them.

150
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,042
So you are going to go in your
little fucking piggy bank right now

151
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,403
and pay back every fucking kopeck

152
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,245
that you stole from Big Head.

153
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,369
And if you don't,
we're gonna take our little show on the road,

154
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,883
perhaps perform it for a man named the DA.

155
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,525
Ridiculous.

156
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,965
Very well.

157
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,969
Game on.

158
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,370
Let's go, Big Head.

159
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,081
Wait.

160
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,084
I may have moved around
some of your money

161
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,924
in a way that wasn't exactly conventional.

162
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,487
- Give me back Big Head's fucking money!
- Yeah!

163
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,005
- Sorry. Sorry.
- No, you did good.

164
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,562
I can't, because I don't have it.

165
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,291
Hey, Marc, we may have a problem.

166
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,601
What's up?

167
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,728
Well, a buddy of mine at Datatrode

168
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,009
sits next to a guy
who just got invited to Pied Piper's beta.

169
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,923
Shit. They're already in beta?

170
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,126
Should I tell Gavin?

171
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,089
Fuck, no. We're still two or three months out.

172
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,529
Yeah, if he hears Pied Piper's already in beta,
trust me, he'll lose his shit.

173
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,685
Fine. But if it ever comes up,
I didn't hear about this.

174
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,562
- And this came in when?
- Forty-three minutes ago.

175
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,483
And deleted six minutes after that.

176
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,245
Fortunately, the filters,
which I had installed, sir,

177
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,725
caught the relevant keywords.

178
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,689
I decided to walk it to you personally.

179
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,366
An employee's withholding
critical information about a competitor.

180
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,805
This is a fireable offense.

181
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,325
You want me to bring this guy in?

182
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,481
No.

183
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,724
Acting on this would expose the fact
that we're reading employees' private emails,

184
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,246
destroying the spirit of trust
and freedom to innovate

185
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,368
that I've worked so hard to build here at Hooli.

186
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,647
You know, it makes you wonder
if the word "Hooli"

187
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,007
has any meaning for these people
whatsoever.

188
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,686
Is there anything I can do?

189
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,121
Yeah.

190
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,489
Get me a look at that Pied Piper beta.

191
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,449
I will figure out a way, sir.

192
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,608
Finally. Where the fuck have you...

193
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,281
- Hey, thanks for the lift, Kevin.
- Yeah, no worries.

194
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,447
Oh, Kevin, this is Dinesh,
one of my coworkers.

195
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,047
- Dinesh, this is Kevin. We met at Philz Coffee.
- Hey.

196
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,650
- We're friends now. Isn't that right, Kevin?
- Yeah.

197
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,880
All right, my friend.
I should get to work, so thanks for the lift.

198
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,008
- Yeah.
- Thanks for the coffees.

199
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,281
Oh...

200
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,803
Catch you later, my friend.

201
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,009
That was my friend, Kevin.

202
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,526
Congratulations. You now have one friend.

203
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,206
He also said there was
a bug on the landing page.

204
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,731
- Well, how severe is it?
- Not bad.

205
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,564
Compared to the rest of what he said,
it's nothing.

206
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,170
Guys, uh, you might as well
hear this from me.

207
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,528
Uh, I just had a long talk about the beta
with my friend, Todd Chambers.

208
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,604
- The Dropbox guy?
- Yeah, he was employee number 11.

209
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,762
Why did you send it to him?
He hates everything.

210
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,604
Well, because I thought he would be
honest with me,

211
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,684
and, um, he was, quite honest. Uh...

212
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,051
He said that in the 15 years
he's been working in the Valley,

213
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,408
our beta was the best beta he's ever seen.

214
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,687
- By far.
- What? Really?

215
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,649
I don't want to count our chickens
before they hatch.

216
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,485
I mean, 3% of hatchlings
are born mutated or dead,

217
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,723
but we may have
a healthy brood on our hands.

218
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,810
I'm getting the same reaction.

219
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,645
I mean, a few bugs here and there,
but overall, they love it.

220
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,768
We might be holding pocket aces here.

221
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,966
Awesome.

222
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,321
Hey, guys.

223
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,641
- How you holding up?
- Good, yeah.

224
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,121
I mean, just trying to make sense
of all the feedback.

225
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,044
Well, you know, I guess
you just can't let it get in your head.

226
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,644
- Did you mean "go to my head"?
- What did I say?

227
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,610
You said "get in your head,"
like it's a bad thing, but it's not.

228
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,250
- It's great. People love it.
- Really?

229
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,766
Yeah. Yeah. I can't believe it myself.

230
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,046
They're flipping out.

231
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,326
That's awesome. That...

232
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,721
And that's for the beta that you sent me?

233
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,610
No, Monica. It's for the other beta
that we've got kicking around here.

234
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:15,885
I mean, I have an inbox full of raves here
for the upload performance, the mobile, the...

235
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,803
What about the interface?

236
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,121
Did people have any issues with that?

237
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,765
No, not at all. Why?

238
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,368
Do you have any issues with the interface?

239
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,326
I haven't actually had a chance
to look at it yet.

240
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,646
Are you serious?
You've been sitting on the beta for a day

241
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,326
after busting my balls
about not getting an invite?

242
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,925
Pretty fuckin' lame.

243
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,843
Yeah. Sorry.

244
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,649
Yeah. Lame.

245
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,051
I just got an email from my friend,
Max Karnow.

246
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,964
And he says, "I heard the beta's awesome.
Can I get a look?"

247
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,002
Guys, I think we're starting to get some buzz.

248
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,366
You know, maybe we should talk to Laurie
about moving up the official launch?

249
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,202
- You want to move it up?
- Yeah, I think we're ready.

250
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,442
I mean, do you think
you could set the meeting?

251
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,401
Yeah.

252
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,324
Yeah, I'll go tell Laurie right now.

253
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,481
Okay.

254
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,405
What was that about?

255
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,209
She's fucking weird.

256
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,361
Hey, Richard, um,

257
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,202
if your friend Max Karnow needs an invite,

258
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,170
you know, I could probably
squeeze him on my list.

259
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,085
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

260
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,925
I'll have to freeze out one of my boys,
but they'll get it.

261
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,209
Just shoot me his email.

262
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,762
The perpetrator has been losing money
for other clients for years,

263
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,970
was lying to us and funneling our money
to said other clients,

264
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,407
therein, fucking us.

265
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,087
You know, I'm sorry to say
this is not an uncommon occurrence.

266
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,404
Wait, it's not an uncommon... So then it...

267
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,127
Okay, got it.

268
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,441
So if it makes any difference,

269
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,127
I'd like to vie for a lesser sentence,

270
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,362
if after he makes full restitution,

271
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,330
he would write a very convincing
public apology, preferably...

272
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,526
Mr. Bachman,

273
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,210
an action like this
is very expensive and time-consuming,

274
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,568
and as you've already pointed out,
even if you do prevail,

275
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,684
the money is gone,
unless you win a court order

276
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,331
allowing you to raid
other innocent people's bank accounts,

277
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,925
and that's a tough sell,

278
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,485
even for a plaintiff who's more,
uh, sympathetic.

279
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,722
Are you calling us unsympathetic?

280
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,848
You just threw a million-dollar party.

281
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,641
A tasteful Polynesian affair,
culturally accurate,

282
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,563
which I'm sure you would appreciate,

283
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,561
and one that we can no longer pay for
because this criminal has left us flat broke.

284
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,721
Also not true.

285
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,646
You have a large stake
in a company called Pied Piper.

286
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,963
Yes, but I can't sell my shares at Pied Piper.
Not now.

287
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,883
Wouldn't it cover your outstanding debts?

288
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,089
Of course. But they could
potentially be worth billions.

289
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,083
Yes, and how do you see
that playing to people

290
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,811
who are being priced out of their homes
by rich tech people?

291
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,768
Have either of you been on a jury?

292
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:58,686
No, of course not. I always get out of it.
The fines are very reasonable.

293
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,524
You don't just throw those things away?

294
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,886
Gentlemen, let me tell you what I see.

295
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,760
I see two able-bodied,
entitled young white men

296
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,923
who lucked into more money than
most people see in five lifetimes,

297
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,401
and who, if they hadn't
had their millions stolen,

298
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,811
would have promptly squandered them

299
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,771
on more things like
relocated swimming pools and lost tiki heads.

300
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,289
It's not lost.

301
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,446
I know exactly where it is. It's in the bay.

302
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,411
And if your Coast Guard
would be a little more helpful,

303
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,244
we probably could have
dragged it out of there by now.

304
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,765
Mr. Bachman,

305
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,971
you pay those caterers and bartenders
you owe money to,

306
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,886
or I assure you that I will prosecute.

307
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,766
Mr. Chugtai,

308
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,287
I am gonna need all the phone numbers
of the people on your list.

309
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,687
Why?

310
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,331
I'm just calling everybody
that was on the beta

311
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,166
and saying hi and a quick thank you
and then just a couple of follow-up questions.

312
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,527
Yeah. I don't think so.

313
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,170
What do you mean?

314
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,322
Well, I mean, put yourself in their shoes.

315
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:03,007
They're, like, snowboarding in Tahoe
or, like, banging some smokin' chick,

316
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,801
and then this fuckin' nerd calls
and he wants to talk about his app.

317
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,881
Buzz-kill.

318
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,849
Wait. Your boys are where?

319
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,282
Well, those are just hypotheticals.

320
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,967
I mean, my boys could be anywhere.
I don't keep track of my boys.

321
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,003
Actually, we can.

322
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:22,650
We have the IP address and GPS coordinates
for every active user,

323
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,243
so we can figure out
just where your boys are at.

324
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,007
Um, you added a god-view?
When did you do that?

325
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,209
Right before I gave it to Tara.
I told you, trust no one.

326
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,126
Oh, that is very cool. Nice work, Gilfoyle.

327
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,086
And we can isolate each of our users.

328
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,400
Dinesh's, for example...

329
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,963
Before we invade people's privacy,
there is a conversation about ethics.

330
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:50,409
Why is it that five of your users
show up at this address?

331
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,130
Oh, it's buggy.

332
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,410
Should we beta-test the god-view?

333
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,165
I'm happy to drag this out
as long as you want to.

334
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,041
Fine.

335
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,882
I was having trouble filling up my list,
so I made up a few people.

336
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,485
Well, people do create imaginary friends
to meet their emotional needs.

337
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,451
When I was little, I used to pretend that
I shared a room with Harriet Tubman

338
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,409
and we were always planning our big escape.

339
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,207
Wait.

340
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:20,887
Who is this,
and why are they at the Hooli campus?

341
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,001
What?

342
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,809
Did you give the beta
to someone at fucking Hooli?

343
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,126
Who's Max Karnow?

344
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:29,205
Oh! That's not one of my friends.
I have no friends. Got him from Richard.

345
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,089
No. No, that can't be right.

346
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,689
I went
to Hendricks' Facebook page.

347
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,001
I found a friend of his
that lived near Palo Alto,

348
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,924
searched his name and found
that he was in the tech business.

349
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,244
I then came up with a great idea
to dummy up an email account in his name,

350
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,446
sent a beta request to Hendricks,
and then voila'.

351
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,410
- That's incredible.
- Yes, well, it is my craft.

352
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,485
You see, I think security detail
is like creating great jazz where we...

353
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,201
What are you talk... I'm talking about the beta.
Will you shut the fuck up?

354
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,564
Fuck, this is good.

355
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,291
Their sign-up flow, their mobile app,
it's just seamless.

356
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,646
How are they doing this?

357
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,088
I can put a team on that, sir.
If you want to know how they...

358
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,845
What? Why are you so high-maintenance?

359
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,241
- Do you want me to answer that, sir?
- No! God damn it!

360
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,970
You're so needy!

361
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,442
Okay, I just talked to the real Max Karnow,
and he had no idea about the beta.

362
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,046
Wow, um, clearly, we're dealing
with a Hooli spy here.

363
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,248
So what do we do?

364
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,766
I mean, shut down his account, obviously.

365
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,730
Yeah. On it. Sorry, Dinesh.

366
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,891
You will now have one less fake friend.

367
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,526
Wait, Gilfoyle.

368
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,003
Is shutting down this guy's account really
the worst thing we can think of to do to him?

369
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,842
Oh, my God. Where the fuck is my head?

370
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,170
Stand by.

371
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,568
Look at their compression ratios.

372
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,371
The more files uploaded, the better they get?

373
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,646
Are we doing that?

374
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,764
No. Not really.

375
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,411
That's gotta be some kind of
machine learning optimization.

376
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,767
- Maybe a neural net?
- Well, then I want that.

377
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,401
You need to put that into our platform. Now.

378
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,404
I'm not even sure we have the resources here
to engineer something like that.

379
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,285
And even if we did, our platform
isn't designed to accommodate it.

380
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,687
You're talking about a ground-up rebuild.

381
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,490
Great. So do that. And beat them to market.

382
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,646
That's impossible.

383
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,085
You're at Hooli now, Marc.

384
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,687
And in case you didn't know, here at Hooli,
we make the impossible possible.

385
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,290
So if I say I need...

386
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,483
- What the fuck is happening?
- Oh, shit!

387
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,449
It looks like a zip bomb.
They must know it's us.

388
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,126
- That hard drive is fucked.
- This is my personal laptop.

389
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,851
You opened a stolen beta
on your personal computer?

390
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,809
Yes. And I installed it on my phone.

391
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,203
Shit. It could fry the entire system.

392
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,169
- Cut the power to the building!
- No, Gavin.

393
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,528
It's isolated to your user account,
so it's just your laptop and your phone.

394
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,523
It has no impact on the rest of the network.

395
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,489
You don't know that. You don't know shit.
None of you do!

396
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,801
You don't even know
what Hendricks is capable of.

397
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,442
Cut the power to the building!
Cut the power to the building!

398
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,684
And that's that.

399
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:05,564
- And now, delete user.
- Nice.

400
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,606
Wait, is that Monica? She finally opened it.

401
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,682
Oh, yeah. Well, that's odd.

402
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,603
It says here that
she started using it yesterday.

403
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,002
Wait, so she lied?

404
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,128
Why would she lie about using the beta?

405
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,965
Yeah, why would Dinesh lie
about having friends?

406
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,646
Why would Tara lie to me
about fucking other guys

407
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,770
when we have a totally open and hedonistic
relationship that allows for behavior like that?

408
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,082
Because people like to lie, Richard.

409
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,609
It's a war of all against all.

410
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,771
The history of humanity
is a book written in blood.

411
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,522
We're all just animals in a pit.

412
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:43,083
- I feel very sad.
- Fucking Gilfoyle.

413
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,608
No, no. What are you doing?
Get back to work.

414
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,160
On what?
You powered down all the computers.

415
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,687
Use a notepad. Code on your phone.
We have a deadline here.

416
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,724
No, Gavin, you have a deadline.

417
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,411
We quit, like we should have done
the first time.

418
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,251
What first time? What are you talking about?

419
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,607
We both worked at Nucleus
right here in this room.

420
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,927
Yeah, before you fired us and rehired us

421
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,241
to do the exact same thing
without ever noticing.

422
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,243
I invited you to my wedding, Gavin.

423
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,166
Why?

424
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,806
We just lost our key engineers.
What the hell do we do now?

425
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,531
No one leaves this room until we figure it out.

426
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,685
Thanks for the lift.

427
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,286
Steve's place
is pretty far away from everything,

428
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,840
but he's letting me stay on his couch for free,
so...

429
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,327
And you were supposed to be my meal ticket.

430
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,761
Yeah.

431
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,764
Hold on. C.J. called.

432
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,248
<i>Hey, uh, just wanted to let you know
about a great new story I'm chasing.</i>

433
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,848
<i>It's a cautionary tale of two young
entrepreneurs who flew too close to the sun.</i>

434
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,890
<i>I mean, apparently,
in the midst of losing millions,</i>

435
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,928
<i>they threw a huge party they couldn't afford.</i>

436
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,402
<i>I talked to two bartenders and a caterer
who worked your party the other night.</i>

437
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,285
<i>None of them have been paid. Call me.</i>

438
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,241
Well, it appears we've spent our last dime

439
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,809
acquiring a tech blog
whose chief focus is chronicling our demise.

440
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,204
Jian-Yang.

441
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,364
<i>Erlich Bachman,
is your refrigerator running?</i>

442
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,409
<i>This is Mike Hunt.</i>

443
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,200
Oh, here, here it is on the right.

444
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,766
Thanks, man.

445
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:24,044
Hey, are you sure you're cool
with me taking both cannonballs?

446
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,123
- I'm sure.
- Thanks, partner.

447
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,611
I got it.

448
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,082
I know you lied.

449
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,244
- Sorry.
- What the fuck?

450
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,284
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

451
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,089
How the hell did you know that I was here?

452
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,367
Well, we have god-view on the beta,

453
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,488
and I saw you leave your office
and come here.

454
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,369
So you're stalking me?

455
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,488
Look, Monica, I know you're lying
about not using the beta,

456
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,040
so why haven't I heard from you?

457
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,841
- Richard...
- No, it's okay.

458
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,210
If you don't like it, you can say it.

459
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,566
Everybody loves it, so I think I can handle
one negative review.

460
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,285
Fine. I don't like it.

461
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,840
Really? Are you serious?
Everybody else loves it.

462
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,844
I've never wanted to
like something more in my life, Richard.

463
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,685
- I just... I don't.
- Okay.

464
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,047
What specifically do you not like about it?

465
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,451
Specifically?

466
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,249
All of it.

467
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,530
I mean, it's not, it's not the UX or the design
or anything that you can tweak.

468
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,571
It's just, the whole thing feels engineered.

469
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,050
Okay. Well, that might make sense
because, um, I'm an engineer.

470
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,646
Look, you've gotten
overwhelmingly positive feedback.

471
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,530
The build is incredibly stable,
and you're out of money.

472
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:03,921
So if you think it's ready, you should launch
and unlock the next $3 million.

473
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,122
Look, Monica, I value your opinion,

474
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,966
and you're the one that doesn't like it,
so I don't know.

475
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,640
Richard, look.

476
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,249
I passed on Slack.

477
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,687
Really?

478
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,650
I never told Laurie.
She'd probably fire me if she knew,

479
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:28,487
but I had a chance to buy
20% of Slack for nothing, and I passed.

480
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,004
I didn't get it. I still don't.

481
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,686
I mean, what is it?
Is it email? Is it a chat room?

482
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,083
Turns out, the answer is,
it's a $3-billion company.

483
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,842
But that's the fucked-up thing
about what we do.

484
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,649
Sometimes our opinion is wrong.

485
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,722
And no matter how good something is,

486
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,371
there's always gonna be someone
who doesn't get it.

487
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,169
And unfortunately, with Pied Piper, it's me.

488
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,281
Um...

489
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:56,560
A week ago, I was worried
about releasing a beta no one would like.

490
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,124
I'm just bummed
that you're the one that doesn't like it.

491
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,646
Which is why you can't listen to anyone else.

492
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,405
If you believe in something,

493
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,370
don't let anyone talk you out of it,
including me.

494
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:13,522
Peter Gregory always said,
"Don't invest in products, invest in people."

495
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,602
I invested in you,

496
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,921
and if you think it's ready to go,

497
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,731
I will go to Laurie and fight like hell for it.

498
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,808
So, what do you want to do?

499
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,121
Congratulations, everyone.

500
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,406
Yeah, I can't believe it.

501
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,130
We're actually finally launching.

502
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,720
Yes. Tuesday, 9:00 a.m.

503
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,882
Pats on the back. Pats on the back.

504
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,441
Gentlemen, I just realized
I've forgotten to take a shit.

505
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,000
So, uh, I'll see you back at the old homestead.

506
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,241
Okay.

507
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,846
Laurie.

508
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,690
I have a business proposition
I'd like to discuss with you.

509
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,929
It's about my shares in Pied Piper.

510
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,760
Okay, T minus five minutes.

511
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,841
Dinesh, are you still
seriously squashing bugs?

512
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:22,845
Not really. I'm so fucking tired,
I'm creating more than I'm fixing.

513
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,649
Where the fuck is Gilfoyle?

514
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,409
This isn't easy for me to do.

515
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,448
You served me well, old friend.

516
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,887
But we're transferring to AWS now,

517
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,887
and I'm afraid you can't come.

518
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,809
Oh, I'm pathetic?

519
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:54,486
I'd rather have a bunch of fake friends
than be best friends with a fucking metal box.

520
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,524
Can't you two see?

521
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,844
You're each other's best friends.

522
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,571
Fuck you, Jared.

523
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,570
Yeah. Jinx.

524
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,403
You owe each other a friendship.

525
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,329
One minute. Holy shit.

526
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,201
Holy shit.

527
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,850
Excuse me. I gotta...

528
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,167
- Hello?
- Hey, it's C.J.

529
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,561
Uh, I just heard from the folks
that worked your party.

530
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,923
- And?
- And it turns out they were paid in full.

531
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,527
So apparently I owe you an apology,
and I feel bad.

532
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,446
Not as bad as I feel, I can assure you.

533
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,284
Yeah, I'm getting another call.

534
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,401
Hello?

535
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,529
<i>Erlich Bachman, this is your mom,</i>

536
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,762
and you are not my baby.

537
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,640
Not now, Jian-Yang! Not now!
Go back into your room!

538
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,610
- Sorry.
-It's okay.

539
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,361
Here we are, Erlich.

540
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,410
Jobs and Woz, Woz and Jobs.

541
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,448
I mean, we did it. You and me, man, forever.

542
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,521
All right.

543
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,524
Richard, never been more excited
to be proven wrong.

544
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,567
Yeah, well, get ready
for your lives to change forever.

545
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:13,842
Five, four, three, two, one...

546
