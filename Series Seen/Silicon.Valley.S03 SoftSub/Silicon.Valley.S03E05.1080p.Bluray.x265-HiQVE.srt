1
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,085
Okay, here's another one.

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,370
TechCrunch says, "Laurie Bream
spotted lunching at the Rosewood

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,886
"with yet another rising tech star,
Sam Herron.

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,567
"Could this finally be
the new CEO of Pied Piper?"

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,844
Maybe she's just fucking them all.

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,207
It's been 10 days.
You know what would be nice?

7
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,762
If I found out what Laurie wanted to do
with my company from her

8
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,245
instead of the fucking Internet.

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,967
Richard, the accountants
finally agreed to release our books.

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,965
Okay.

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,721
Hey, Richard.
ls there anything we should be doing?

12
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,087
I don't know. Why are you asking me?
I'm not the CEO.

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,286
There is no CEO.

14
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,284
Because, apparently,
Jack's empty fucking chair

15
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,731
is a better choice than I am.

16
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,644
So, maybe ask the chair, see what it thinks.

17
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,040
Say what you will about the chair,

18
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,010
but at least it never told me
to build a fucking box.

19
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,561
True.
Compared to Richard, it's a lot sturdier.

20
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,644
And it has a lot less of
Barker's ass rubbed all over it.

21
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,361
Are you serious?

22
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,241
On top of Jack's
ridiculous severance package,

23
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,164
we spent $1,000
on each one of your fucking monitors?

24
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,643
We did? Huh. That's very pricey.

25
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,929
So what? Raviga funded us for $5 million.

26
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,686
There's no way we burned through all that.

27
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,684
Do you have any idea how these deals work?
That money's tranched.

28
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,771
- What's that?
- Well, from the Old French for "slice."

29
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,004
Yeah, try to keep up, Dinesh.

30
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,764
We get our money in stages.

31
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,491
Right? We get $2 million upfront
to get us going,

32
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,130
to design and build the product,

33
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,727
but we don't get the next three million
until we take a product to market.

34
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,491
And Jack was
okay with hemorrhaging money,

35
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,483
because he thought
we were launching the box

36
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,211
and then getting the next three million
in the next few weeks.

37
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,721
But the platform will take
way longer to launch than that.

38
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,447
Yes. So we are effectively
a $250 million company

39
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,727
who just took $5 million in funding,

40
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,804
and now we're dead-ass broke.

41
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,804
Our burn rate is astronomical,

42
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,247
and every day we sit in limbo like this...

43
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,371
What if we don't?

44
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,248
What if we don't sit in limbo?

45
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,004
Like, fuck limbo, right?

46
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,601
I mean, right now,
let's fire all these fucking sales assholes,

47
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,047
and break the lease on this place
and get the fuck out of here.

48
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,290
Can we do that?
There's no CEO here to approve any of that.

49
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,001
Yeah. There's also no CEO here
to tell me not to do it, right?

50
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,567
That's right. You're the CTO.
Technically, you're the ranking officer.

51
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,961
Fucking A.

52
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,203
Look, when, or if,
a new CEO comes to take over the company,

53
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,205
we will do what they say
to the best of our abilities.

54
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,647
But there is a very real possibility

55
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,087
that there won't be a company
for them to take over

56
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,282
if we don't do something about it now.

57
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,371
- So, no more surprise waffles.
- What?

58
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,885
- No more Chef Amy.
- No.

59
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,201
And no more of these stupid offices, okay?

60
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,611
We're going to move back to the hostel.

61
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,526
- Fuck.
- Dinesh, we need to cut every corner,

62
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,128
save every penny, and plow it
into engineers to build the platform. Okay?

63
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,281
Then we will be back on track.

64
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,603
So Gilfoyle, Dinesh,
pack up those gold-plated monitors

65
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,764
because we are selling them.

66
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,202
Jared, come on. Let's do this.

67
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,448
Hmm. Well, that sucks.

68
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,641
Jesus.

69
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,165
Okay, guys.
Can I have your attention, please?

70
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,720
Yeah, next goal wins.

71
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,327
No. Now. Sorry, it's got to be now.

72
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,046
And so, bring it in, Dang,

73
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,010
Chef Amy, Jan the Man,
Keith, Northeast Regional.

74
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,246
And do you still have your shadow?

75
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,766
- Yo.
- Hey, there he is.

76
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,604
Okay, uh, circle up.

77
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,888
All right, I have some news for you.

78
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,650
Is this about the new CEO?

79
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,324
Recode is saying
that it could be Reid Hoffman.

80
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,405
No. I don't know anything about that.

81
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,166
No, no. There's no new CEO.
There's no new employees of any kind.

82
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,245
There's actually... It's more about
you guys becoming former employees.

83
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,564
So, look,
we're heading in a different direction.

84
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,242
And what that means is,
if I haven't taken you aside

85
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,802
and spoken to you privately about staying on,
that does mean that you are

86
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,370
terminated immediately.

87
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,610
So, Dang, Chef Amy, Jan the Man, all of Sales,

88
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,648
I am really sorry about all this.

89
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,451
Are you sure that you can fire us,
like, legally?

90
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,130
Yeah. Yes, absolutely.

91
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,363
I'm CTO. I'm the highest ranking officer,
so yes, answer.

92
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,524
You're still CTO? Laurie hasn't fired you yet?

93
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,488
No, she has... Why would she fire me?

94
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,642
Well, Code/Rag said
that your tech is mediocre

95
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,728
and that's why no one will take the CEO job.

96
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,961
- What?
- Yeah.

97
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,280
That's why I assumed that you'd been fired.

98
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,520
Uh, maybe she's waiting till Friday to fire him.

99
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,962
- Oh, that makes sense.
- No, it doesn't make sense.

100
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,644
That's not what's happening, okay?

101
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,484
I'm not getting fired. That's crazy.

102
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,688
I haven't read this article.
Okay, maybe I'm too busy

103
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,366
making the tech awesome,
because it's not mediocre.

104
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,920
It's actually...
Turns out, it's fucking revolutionary.

105
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,082
So, I guess that's the truth.

106
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,124
And also, I'm not fired,
these guys aren't fired, you all are fired.

107
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,249
Everyone from this wall is fired.
So, enjoy being fired.

108
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,410
Jesus. This is a good apple.

109
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,722
- Where did you get this?
- Oh, I have a fruit guy.

110
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,721
Fantastic.

111
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,770
Read me back what we have so far.

112
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,323
Uh, "Bachman and Bighetti
shall each include in this venture

113
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,687
"any and all portfolio companies.

114
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,570
"The exception shall be for Pied Piper."

115
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,730
Hey, how come Pied Piper is not a part of it?

116
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,690
'Cause, you know, I actually used to
work there, so maybe it should be?

117
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,128
Big Head, Pied Piper
is no longer an incubating entity.

118
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,686
It would be unfair to you,
and to me, and to them

119
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,206
for me to relinquish
any of my shares in their company.

120
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,248
And besides, like you,
I'm giving up everything else I have of value,

121
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,891
shares, options, cash, liquid assets.

122
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,043
Wait. So all my assets?

123
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,890
That seems like kind of a lot.

124
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,170
It is a lot, Big Head.
We're both giving up a lot.

125
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,368
We're both gaining a lot also.

126
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,125
And that's what
every successful partnership is about.

127
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,809
Committing fully, blindly,
and without concern of the consequences,

128
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,962
-like marriage.
- Right.

129
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,125
Oh, here. Get this down.

130
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,690
In the event of a tie vote,
any disagreement shall be settled

131
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,802
with a toss of a coin
of Mr. Bachman's choosing.

132
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,166
What the fuck are you doing in here?

133
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,811
Can't you see we're having a meeting?

134
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,049
Go ahead, Big Head, read that back to me.

135
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,170
Oh, um, "In the event of a tie..."

136
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,571
The fucking juicer's broken.

137
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,483
This is the second one in two days!

138
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,925
C.J. Cantwell of Code/Rag writes, and I quote,

139
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,446
"Having met this many candidates
without closing one,

140
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,447
"one can't help wonder
why Pied Piper can't land a man.

141
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,766
"Could the vaunted tech
of founder Richard Hendricks,

142
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,083
"whom I once called
the next Mark Zuckerberg,

143
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:08,166
"be turning Pied Piper from
a unicorn into a donkey wearing a party hat?"

144
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,769
- And?
- And she's slandering my tech.

145
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,683
It's the one thing that's working around here.

146
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,924
Look, I think if I just talk to her,
I can get her to change it.

147
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,601
No. I do not want you to engage
with a muckraker like C.J. Cantwell

148
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,808
simply to salve your male ego.

149
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,122
My male ego
has nothing to do with this, Laurie.

150
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:30,489
Look, good coders won't want to work
for a company they think has shitty tech.

151
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,723
I need to get ahead of this now.
And if I don't, we're done.

152
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,850
Richard, whether you appreciate this or not,
I do actually have a plan here.

153
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,844
You can meet with everyone
in Palo Alto to replace me as CEO.

154
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,524
I'm not going to tell you how to do your job.

155
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,524
Okay, but I need to do
something about this, now.

156
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,967
She's calling us the next Clinkle.

157
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,925
Clinkle, Laurie. Clinkle.

158
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,002
You do know
what happened to Clinkle, right?

159
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,560
- Do you want us to be Clinkle?
- Please, just stop saying "Clinkle."

160
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,005
It jars the ear.

161
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,602
Fine. I will have my office set up an interview.

162
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,481
But I want you
to present yourself well, Richard.

163
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,562
Be showered, groomed, well-dressed.

164
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,486
And you will need to sit down with our head
of PR beforehand to go over talking points.

165
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,561
Why?

166
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,242
Because you are in an emotional state,

167
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,767
and when you are emotional,
you become highly inarticulate.

168
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,002
Well, I don't say that's true.

169
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,971
Okay. Yes. Fine. Sure.

170
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,041
Um...

171
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,766
And thank you, Laurie.

172
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,961
Before you ask, the answer is yes,
I did blow all these hard drives clean.

173
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,607
- So...
- You really are a moron.

174
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,685
The only way to really blow
the hard drives clean

175
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,364
is to take a drill and punch a hole through it.

176
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,047
All right, calm down, Snowden.
I zeroed them all out, we're fine.

177
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,009
Welcome, welcome.

178
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,243
Uh, we have lost our lease,
so everything must go.

179
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,087
The chairs are arranged
in ascending order of lumbar support.

180
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,844
So, have a gander.

181
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,529
Oh, uh, word to the wise,

182
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,644
the Haworths are like a spa day
for the buttocks.

183
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,803
Yeah, and I have a fragile posterior.

184
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,451
My aunt used to call me "glasshole."

185
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,407
So, you can take it from me.

186
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,125
Look at these fucking maggots.

187
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,010
Crawling all over our garbage,
leaving their slime of mediocrity.

188
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,167
Ah, I thought you'd feel right at home
in a marketplace,

189
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,242
haggling, selling your monkey paws,

190
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,051
looking for Indiana Jones in a wicker basket.

191
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,288
Okay. Marion was in the wicker basket,

192
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,250
Indiana Jones was tipping them over,
you fucking idiot.

193
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,081
Hi.

194
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,881
Let me know if you have any questions.

195
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,362
Well, how about that? I made my first sale.

196
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,248
I've organized a lot of estate sales,
so this is kind of my wheelhouse.

197
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,288
- What?
- I have a lot of elderly friends.

198
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,841
Oh, that is a fun item.

199
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,367
That's a hardware fan.

200
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,688
You've got the yellow hoodie on today.

201
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,650
Oh, yeah.

202
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,450
Wait a second.

203
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,250
None of these are signed.

204
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,967
Oh, yeah. Urn, it's just my business manager
had some questions

205
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,486
about the way some of this stuff
was being arranged.

206
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,810
Like, he said something about
how it's not a corporation.

207
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,282
It's just a general partnership or something.

208
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,362
I mean, he told me I didn't understand,
which is true,

209
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,965
so he wanted to maybe talk to you about it.

210
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,520
So you want to lawyer up?
Is that what we're doing?

211
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,610
I don't think he has a law degree.

212
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,964
Big Head, I would hope that a handshake deal
would be good enough for you.

213
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,005
Because we're headed down a long road,

214
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,890
and that road must be paved with trust.
Blind trust.

215
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,763
And you bringing in these so-called "experts"

216
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,606
really gives me pause,

217
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,484
and it insults my honor.

218
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,644
Huh. Uh, sorry, hold on. I got to take this.
I'll be right back.

219
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,563
Sorry. Hello?

220
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,404
Hey. Uh, how do I look?

221
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,406
If I'm being honest,
like a ventriloquist dummy.

222
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,648
Uh, okay.
Well, you know, that's actually kind of fitting,

223
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,326
because I'm on my way to Raviga right now

224
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,370
to meet with a PR person
to tell me exactly what to say

225
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,363
to a reporter and how to say it.

226
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,566
Well, that does make sense.

227
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,405
You do tend to babble on
when you're under pressure.

228
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,526
Why does this thing people say?

229
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,846
Why indeed?

230
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,251
That was weird.

231
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,122
I just got a call
from Laurie Bream's office at Raviga,

232
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,522
asking if I'd want to interview
for the job of CEO at Pied Piper.

233
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,731
What? Are you fucking kidding me?

234
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,211
That's exactly what I said.

235
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,204
Then I said no, and then we both hung up.

236
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:31,001
I mean, I assume they hung up.
I had already hung up, so...

237
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,410
Wow. Wow.

238
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,201
Okay. Okay. Yeah, great. Big Head.

239
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,930
Big Head? Fucking kidding me?

240
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,406
What the fuck is going on?

241
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,290
Big Head, you can insult me all you want

242
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,522
by involving your self-described shylocks,

243
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,530
but to insult Richard and humiliate him,

244
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,807
that's like kicking a child
who's done nothing to deserve it.

245
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,168
I may not be able to finish my ramen.

246
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,485
I told them no.

247
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,451
Hi there. Richard Hendricks
here to see Dawn Simon, PR.

248
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,807
Sure, she'll be meeting you
in the small conference room.

249
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,321
- Um, do you need me...
- No, no. I, uh, I know where it is.

250
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,244
It turns out, I actually know something.

251
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,560
I'm not a fucking idiot.

252
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,243
- Richard Hendricks. Hi.
- Before we get any further,

253
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,561
I just want you to know
that I'm not going to be yelling at you,

254
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,880
but I probably am going to yell.

255
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,130
- Okay.
- Okay. Uh...

256
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,931
Because this is bullshit.

257
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,401
Honestly, I mean, I get it.
This is your job. You're in PR.

258
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,245
Your job is to pretty much tell me
what I can't say.

259
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,527
I mean, when I talk to this reporter,
I probably can't say

260
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,366
how fucked up it is that Laurie Bream fired me

261
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,801
and then replaced me with Action Jack Barker.

262
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,531
I probably can't say
how the only action he took

263
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,490
was to essentially pick the wrong product
and then bleed the company dry.

264
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,601
And I probably can't say
how fucking pissed off I am

265
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,401
that Laurie Bream is out there
gallivanting around the Valley,

266
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:56,044
interviewing every dickhole on Earth
for my job, including Big Head,

267
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,451
a man that I fired, by the way.

268
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,010
And no offense, I like him. I do actually.

269
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,923
He's a close friend of mine,
been that way for years.

270
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,401
But he is a bit of a simpleton,
and his name's fucking Big Head.

271
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,891
But, okay, look.

272
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,802
I want to be CEO of Pied Piper, okay?

273
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,930
It is my company. I worked my ass off
to build this company, okay?

274
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,650
That's my job. I deserve it.

275
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,121
And it fucking kills me that Laurie is out there

276
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,965
trying to give it to someone else,
anyone but me.

277
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,441
But I probably can't say that, can I?

278
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,724
You can say anything you want to say to me.

279
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,521
All right.

280
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,685
Thank you for meeting me, Monica.

281
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,003
You are from...

282
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,726
Baltimore.

283
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,368
H.L. Mencken hails from Baltimore.

284
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,047
Who?

285
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,810
Widely perceived as a racist,

286
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,687
but his work on the English language
is comprehensive,

287
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,243
and his perspicacious skewering
of evangelicals is laudable.

288
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:59,085
Monica, my mission here
is not merely to have fun.

289
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,691
That's okay.

290
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,245
When I voted against you
at the board meeting, I just want...

291
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,529
Monica, this is not about you, for once.

292
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,288
I brought you here to say

293
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,286
- I am sorry.
- For...

294
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,129
Ah, yes, of course.
You are going to make me say it.

295
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,326
Why am I not surprised?

296
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,766
I made a mistake with Richard Hendricks.

297
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,962
And out I went, right on my ass.

298
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:28,841
And then Laurie put that jackhole Barker
in to bankrupt the company.

299
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,570
But does she cop to that? No, no, no.

300
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,842
Because the Laurie-tron 6,000

301
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,809
isn't programmed to admit
when she's made a mistake.

302
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,130
I made an error.

303
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,849
Wow, um, that's really big of you to admit.

304
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,560
I should not have removed him as CEO,

305
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,087
and installing Jack Barker in his place
only compounded that error.

306
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,801
But if that's true, then why are you meeting
with so many other CEO candidates?

307
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,647
I am meeting publically
with a number of high-value candidates

308
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,846
I know to be unavailable,

309
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,402
as well as with a number
of less-qualified candidates

310
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,687
with whom Richard compares favorably.

311
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,571
That's why you called Big Head.

312
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:09,124
Yes. You see, Richard must not be perceived
as being the most expedient candidate.

313
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,886
He must be seen as the correct candidate.

314
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,770
This is very exciting for Richard.

315
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,811
I have been impressed by his conduct
in a tough situation.

316
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,765
- He's shown mettle.
- Mmm-hmm. Definitely.

317
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,764
Therefore, I will call for a vote
at the next board meeting

318
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,841
to offer him the job.

319
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,210
That is, of course, assuming he continues
to demonstrate an air of professionalism.

320
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,090
Hi, Dawn. Are you waiting for someone?

321
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,288
Yes. I'm supposed to be meeting
with Richard Hendricks

322
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,249
before he sits down with a Code/Rag reporter.

323
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,769
Oh, that's weird. I saw him earlier.

324
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,081
And that is why...

325
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,085
I'm just being honest here.

326
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,889
I think that Peter Gregory
is better off where he is.

327
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,123
Just saying, because if he knew
what Laurie was doing to his company,

328
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,362
he probably would want to take a gun
and blow his brains out.

329
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,485
Uh, okay.

330
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,370
We should probably start talking about
the things that I can say.

331
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,802
Um...

332
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,042
Richard. Richard Hendricks?

333
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,569
Yes. Who are you?

334
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,642
Dawn Simon, Raviga's publicity director.

335
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,807
So that would make you...

336
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,723
C.J. Cantwell, Code/Rag.

337
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,487
Thank you, I think I have everything I need.

338
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,250
Please tell me that went well.

339
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,724
Yep. No, yeah.

340
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,806
It, uh... It was gone great.

341
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,964
Yep. It had gone.

342
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,044
It was great.

343
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,800
Uh, she's a great guy.

344
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,690
Really. Girl. She's cool.
She's a cool one.

345
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,444
Cool. I can just... I can get out here?

346
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,726
- Just 'cause I got another thing.
- Yeah.

347
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,565
Slow down. Listen to me.
Look, in my defense,

348
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,688
I said those were all the things
I can't say, okay?

349
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,285
So it's kind of like I didn't even say them.

350
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,045
But you did say them,
at a meeting you scheduled with a reporter.

351
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,248
Reporter? Come on, you're a tech blogger.

352
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,971
Oh, really. Hard to see
why Laurie insisted on a PR rep for you.

353
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,921
Look, uh, just...
Tell me what I can do to kill this?

354
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,324
- You want me to spike the story?
- Yes, please.

355
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,121
Give me something better. I don't know,
go on a drunken racist Twitter rant,

356
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,521
or get in your car, run over Elon Musk,

357
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,967
and give me an exclusive from jail. Yeah.

358
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,883
Otherwise, I'm posting this
at noon tomorrow, so...

359
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,327
No, no, no, no. Look. Look.

360
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,289
If you want to leave,
you're going to have to run me over!

361
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,810
These offices were nice.

362
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,001
Now everything looks so bare.

363
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,005
Yeah. There is a certain sad vulnerability to it.

364
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,367
Have you ever seen a naked dead person?

365
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,807
No. No. No.

366
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,641
Hmm.

367
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,401
Well, the good news is, we cleared

368
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,922
almost $70,000 from selling all this stuff.

369
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,680
That's not enough
to afford all the coders we need.

370
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,481
We need at least a dozen.

371
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,650
Where would we even put them now?

372
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,847
Shall we?

373
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,285
Wait. Where's my hard drive?

374
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,966
What did it look like?

375
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,884
It just looked like
a normal standard hard drive.

376
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,123
- You sure it was in your bag?
- Yeah, it was in my bag.

377
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,367
Could it maybe have slid out
and was next to your bag,

378
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,602
which was next to
all the hard drives we got rid of?

379
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,689
Did you sell my personal hard drive?

380
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,241
You didn't happen to
wipe that one clean, too, did you?

381
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,848
- My personal hard drive?
- Yeah.

382
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,526
No! Fuck!

383
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,241
So it had our confidential IP on it?

384
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:03,963
Yes. All the work we did on the platform,
the box, everything.

385
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,846
Okay, well, what's gone
is not necessarily lost.

386
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,128
Okay, we just need to find it.

387
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,248
I found my retainer in the school dumpster.

388
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,369
I found my biological father
in a militia up in the Ozarks.

389
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,521
This should be no problem.

390
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,445
Don't worry, Dinesh, we'll find it.

391
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,730
Uh...

392
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,962
Does he not know we're moving out?

393
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,407
Should We tell him?

394
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,122
No. Jack paid him in full up front,

395
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,448
and he seems so at peace.

396
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,411
- All right.
- All right.

397
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,364
I am such an idiot.

398
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,885
You've got no choice, Richard.

399
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,850
You need to go in to Laurie
and just tell her what happened.

400
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:01,130
What? It's bad enough she's going to find out
what I said after this piece posts online.

401
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,965
You want me to go in
and tell her right to her face?

402
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,041
No fucking way.

403
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,566
You could spin it. Tell her you're sorry.

404
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:11,281
I had it.
I had my old CEO job back, and I fucked it up.

405
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,131
I'll get it.

406
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:19,360
Ah. The Super Angel Premium Deluxe.

407
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,600
In the flesh.

408
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,170
Yeah, I had to drive to San Mateo
to get one that has auto-reverse.

409
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,446
Why didn't you send your assistant?

410
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,764
She was on the phone, so...

411
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,721
Well, Big Head,
it takes a brave man to admit his mistakes,

412
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:39,362
and with this token of apology,
you've officially righted your wrong.

413
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,883
Consider the matter resolved.

414
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,041
Cool.

415
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,446
Traditionally, the offender
shakes the offendee's hand,

416
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,090
so you would come to me.

417
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,685
That's an honest Thomas.

418
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,408
Gentlemen, Monica,
from the ashes of whatever happens here

419
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,685
will rise the phoenix
that shall be known as Bachmanity.

420
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,444
That's what you're gonna call your company?

421
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,280
Yeah, well, before it was gonna be
Bachman Capital.

422
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,849
Because I provide the Bachman,
and he provides the capital.

423
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,280
Yeah, but then, we compromised,
and made it Bachmanity,

424
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:20,365
'cause it's Bachman from him
and then the "etti" from me.

425
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,080
So it's two syllables each.

426
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:26,081
Very much into keeping score, this one.
Have a seat.

427
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,322
I'll go fetch the documents and my Montblanc.

428
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,921
Psst!

429
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:37,770
So, slight hiccup. I tracked down
the woman who bought the drive,

430
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,127
but she wasn't interested in selling it back.

431
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,491
Apparently, she's already given it
to her elderly father

432
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,245
and booked the Geek Squad
to set it up for him this afternoon.

433
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,244
What about my drive?
All our stuff is on there.

434
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,091
I think we're fine.

435
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,881
She said he mostly uses the computer
to download photos of old ships.

436
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,004
I don't think he'll be able to find our files
even if he wanted to.

437
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,483
Well, I mean, hopefully. But still...

438
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,007
Dinesh is right, this is sloppy.

439
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,801
Where does this guy live?

440
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,608
Shit, Richard, I'm sorry, man.

441
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,404
Initial here and here.

442
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,287
No. It's okay. I deserve it. It's my own fault.

443
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,129
And you're gonna wanna sign here.

444
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,646
Still, man, that just really sucks.

445
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,530
You know, I bet you wish
you could just scrub the whole Internet,

446
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,250
like Gavin Belson does, right?

447
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,281
Whoa, weird.

448
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,527
Every single one of my signatures
looks totally different.

449
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,568
- Wait. What?
- Yeah, look.

450
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,530
This one's in cursive,
this one's just printed, and then I...

451
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,887
One I just wrote "Big Head,"
but that's not going to hold up.

452
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,686
No, no, no. Did you just say
Gavin Belson scrubbed the Internet?

453
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,207
Oh, yeah.

454
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,522
Yeah, and then they told me to my face,

455
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,489
that after Nucleus was shut down,

456
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,608
Gavin had one of his execs
order them to scrub

457
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,803
all negative mentions of Nucleus
off of Hooli Search.

458
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,526
Wow. Okay, when exactly did this happen?

459
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,962
No, no. Actually...

460
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,567
You told me that you would spike my story
if I give you something better.

461
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,641
This is better, right?

462
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,922
Yeah. Light-years better, actually.

463
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,570
Your story's spiked. Great, okay.

464
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,849
As long as we're trading apples
for comparable apples,

465
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,526
I've got a fresh and juicy
that's ripe for the picking.

466
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,086
Ms. Cantwell, what say you to an exclusive
on the launch of a future financial behemoth?

467
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,169
How about we just stick with Gavin?

468
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,728
Gavin for Richard? Deal?

469
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,961
Done.

470
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,680
Monica, do you really need to be here?

471
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,086
- Geek Squad.
- The computer's right here.

472
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,840
You're not wearing the shirt.

473
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,565
I spilled coffee on it.

474
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,366
I'm a nerd.

475
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:10,243
All right. We're all set here.

476
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,087
Yes.

477
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,241
Can I have my hard drive?

478
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,130
Oh, no. You fucking dick.

479
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,681
Shit.

480
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,965
You're gonna be replacing it.

481
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,929
You're back. How did the board meeting go?

482
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,601
Well, um...

483
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:53,040
You're looking at the past, present,
and possibly future CEO of Pied Piper.

484
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,564
Oh, that is...

485
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,130
Oh, congratulations!

486
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,730
- Jared...
- My captain.

487
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,202
"O Captain! my Captain!
Rise up and hear the bells

488
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:08,246
"Rise up-for you the flag is flung
for you the bugle trills."

489
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,641
All right. Dismissed.

490
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:15,569
Well, uh, just to remind you,
Pied Piper is still a sinking ship, so...

491
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,210
Enough with the maritime metaphors.

492
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,523
This is honestly, like, the best birthday gift
that I ever could've asked for.

493
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,484
-It's your birthday?
- Uh, I don't know.

494
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,127
The CPS worker
couldn't find my birth certificate,

495
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,970
but maybe now it is.

496
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,042
And in other good news, we've managed
to fill out our engineering team.

497
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,369
Did you tell them that my Fage's off-limits?

498
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,443
Oh, that won't be a worry.

499
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,521
Come meet them.

500
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,450
All right, guys, who wants to start work
on the fragment uploader?

501
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,801
Uh, Gleb, why don't you and Sanjay take it?

502
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,484
Richard, say hi.

503
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:50,361
Yes. Hello, lam, um, Richard Hendricks,
the CEO of Pied Piper.

504
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,006
- Welcome aboard.
- Hi.

505
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,206
What the fuck is going on here?

506
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,322
We got a little creative.

507
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,366
Um, I read that the woman who started Pegg'd

508
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,411
built her entire app using a team of coders
from India she never met in person.

509
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,642
And it only cost $15,000.

510
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:08,560
Yeah, so we figured why limit ourselves
to a few expensive people in the Valley,

511
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,087
when we could afford a full complement
if we outsourced?

512
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:15,369
Um, Richard, I know we said
that we sold everything in the offices

513
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,490
to pay for these guys,
but that was not exactly true.

514
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,003
Um, we kept one thing.

515
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,841
Okay.

516
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,891
Oh, wow. It's the CEO chair.

517
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,285
Ah.

518
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,566
Have a seat.

519
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,681
Okay.

520
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,601
Okay, uh...

521
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,970
Well, why don't we

522
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,682
go around the room, or screens, or whatever,
and introduce ourselves?

523
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:53,283
Hello, my name is Gleb. I am in Bulgaria.

524
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,964
Hello, I am Sanjay. I am here in Mumbai, India.

525
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,405
- You having trouble?
- No.

526
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,563
Hello. I am Elisabet.
I am speaking to you from Estonia.

527
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,290
Uh, thank you for the...

528
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,964
Whoa!

529
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,451
It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine.

530
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,761
-It's fine. I got it. I got it.
- Dude.

531
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,127
- I got it. I got it.
- You're making a great first impression.

532
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,323
Sorry. Can we go to the...
Do the names one more time?
