1
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,084
Well, Richard, according
to all of your test results,

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,483
you are what we
in the medical field call healthy.

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,602
In fact, you've got kind of a glow about you.

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,011
- Oh, really?
- Absolutely.

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,488
You know, if it were medically possible,
I might even think that you were pregnant.

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,210
Of course, I thought
my girlfriend was pregnant,

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,248
and I was sure wrong about that. Whoops!

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,122
Hey, give me that ring back!

9
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,044
Oh, what a mess.

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,125
What a mess that was.

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,203
So, been any big changes for you,
diet or exercise?

12
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,568
Well, I actually got fired
as CEO of my company.

13
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,247
I'm working now as the CTO
under the new CEO, Jack Barker.

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,290
Wait a minute.
You got a boss at your own company?

15
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,406
Yeah, I know that sounds bad,
but honestly, he handles all the budgeting,

16
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,891
all the VC funding.

17
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,442
He just negotiated a great new lease
on our new offices.

18
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,249
I don't know.
I think this could be great for me.

19
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,881
Boy, I don't think I could have another doctor
coming in here, being my boss.

20
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,203
No. It'd be like, "Hey, boss,
is it okay if I listen to his heart?

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,329
"Can I do that? Oh, no? Sorry.
No, I won't. Okay.

22
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,641
"Whatever you say."

23
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,400
- Funny.
- It is funny. Yeah.

24
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,801
But listen, if it works for you, that's great.

25
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,089
Just one more thing.
I've gotta check your testicles.

26
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,881
Oh, my God. Okay.
What, for like a hernia or something?

27
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,406
No. I just wanna make sure they're still there.

28
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,129
Oh, wow.
This is going to be our office? All of this?

29
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,770
Yeah,
Jack said we have the whole floor.

30
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,280
Wow, look at that kitchen.
This is great.

31
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,846
Richard, is that our new logo?

32
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,282
I like it. It's clean and elegant,
but not without some danger.

33
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,291
Gentlemen, welcome.

34
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,648
I moved away from the flute-playing guy.

35
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,042
I don't know if you guys realized it,
but that was a little phallic.

36
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,971
I didn't want to waste your time with it,
so I just pulled the trigger.

37
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,326
Mari Sheibley did this.

38
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,490
Oh. Mari Sheibley.
That must've set you back a bit.

39
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,483
No. She's a friend.

40
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,450
Yeah. I know her, as well.

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,411
Casually.

42
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,926
So, why don't I show
you guys your new home?

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,082
Hopefully, it lives up to your standards.

44
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,007
Yeah, compared to
the shit shack we're used to,

45
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,320
anything's an improvement.

46
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,687
Ah, an insult born of respect.

47
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,764
I'll worry when we start
complimenting each other.

48
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,966
Fucking dick.

49
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,010
I assume you saw Hiroki
putting in the water feature.

50
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,208
Good feng shui. Gotta have that.

51
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,087
This is the engineering area.

52
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,281
We're gonna work here?

53
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,763
That is a separate, professionally-catered
micro-kitchen back there.

54
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,366
I want you hungry here, never here.

55
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,125
This is all great,
but can we really afford all this?

56
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,407
Hey, step into my office, Richard.

57
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,925
- Here.
- Okay.

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,445
I wanna show you something.

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,048
This is way better
than Erlich's shithole.

60
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,160
"The Conjoined
Triangles of Success"?

61
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,446
I invented that,
and now it's taught at business schools.

62
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,445
You see what's on the bottom here?
The foundation of the whole thing.

63
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,006
- Growth?
- Growth.

64
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,205
The more brilliant people
we can get working here,

65
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,205
then the faster we can get
whatever is in your head out into the world.

66
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,042
Let me tell you a story.

67
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,248
In 1999,

68
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,405
Google was a little startup, just like we are.

69
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,723
And when they started
bringing in chefs and masseuses,

70
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,370
we thought, "They're nuts!"

71
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,171
But they were attracting
the best possible people,

72
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:01,849
and they were able to create the best product,
and now they're worth over $400 billion.

73
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,529
And do you know the name of that company?

74
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,809
Uh, Google, right?
You said it at the beginning of the story.

75
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,121
You're right. I did that wrong.

76
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,130
And the whole point is
that all of this is a sound investment

77
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,728
as long as we are able to get the best people
and make the best possible product.

78
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,690
All right. Winner gets the big monitor. Okay?

79
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,524
I understand how this works.

80
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,931
Ready?
Ready?

81
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,520
- Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.
- Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

82
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,446
Suck it.

83
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,170
I should've known you'd throw rock.

84
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,045
That's all you know in Pakistan.
It's in your blood.

85
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,651
Don't you guys call it "Rock, Rock, Rock"?

86
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,807
That's funny.

87
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,281
You should type up all your racist jokes
on your tiny monitor.

88
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,204
Is that monitor not big enough?
You need a bigger monitor?

89
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,126
You just put it on the list over there,
and our purchasing guy will hook you up.

90
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,728
- Seriously?
- Absolutely.

91
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,487
Jared, how about you?
You need any new gear for the office?

92
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,802
No, I'm BYOC.

93
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,804
Let me know if you need anything.

94
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,603
Richard, do you think it'd be okay
if, uh, I took this box?

95
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,921
I'm moving out
of Noah's guest house after work.

96
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,845
And you want to sleep in that box?

97
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,363
No. I haven't slept in a box in years. Stop.

98
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,761
Now that, um, Pied Piper's funded,

99
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,326
I have enough money
to move back into my condo.

100
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,765
Oh, congratulations.

101
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,007
I thought you sold it.

102
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,323
No, I've been AirBNB'ing it out
to cover the mortgage.

103
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,084
But it'll be good to get home.

104
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,691
I've been missing my tub a lot,

105
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,889
and, uh, Noah's been using
a lot of hate speech with me lately,

106
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,883
so, moving will be a good thing.

107
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,849
All right, guys, think I'm gonna take off

108
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,366
unless you need me to stick around,
help the transition.

109
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,526
-L...
- By doing what?

110
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,410
I could introduce you
to some of the people that work here.

111
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,404
I made some major inroads with Hiroki.

112
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,768
- No.
- Uh, why would we want that?

113
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,484
Fair... Yeah, fair point.

114
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,449
So, welcome to your new home.

115
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,604
Enjoy it, guys. I gave you this.

116
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,803
on.

117
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,400
Sorry. Sorry.

118
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,687
How was everyone's morning?

119
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,690
Let me tell you about mine.

120
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,129
I started my day, as I always do,
by typing my own name into Hooli-Search.

121
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,040
I enjoy the ritual,
which is designed to center me.

122
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,963
But lately, it's been doing the opposite.

123
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,970
Whose work station is this?

124
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,966
Observe.

125
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,762
These are all remnants of a time
before I wrote Nucleus down.

126
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:47,002
Why are we allowing our own technology
to dredge up our painful past?

127
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,244
Why is it that when I type my own name
into my own company search engine,

128
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,529
the fucking Internet rains
shit-bolts down on me?

129
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,927
I want this to stop!

130
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,561
These articles are part of the public record.

131
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,887
Your point?

132
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,685
Are you suggesting that we alter

133
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,366
the fundamental neutrality
of the Hooli-Search algorithm?

134
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,491
That's a clear violation of the public trust.

135
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,722
Yelp is threatening to sue
Google for this very thing.

136
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,521
I can't, in good conscience,
order Hooli-Search engineers to do that.

137
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,285
I never suggested anything of the sort.

138
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,328
No Hooli-Search engineer

139
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,325
will ever be asked to alter the neutrality
of the algorithm.

140
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,560
And so, Gavin doesn't want to see

141
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,041
any more negative mentions
of Nucleus on Hooli-Search.

142
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,644
So, we're gonna alter the search algorithm?

143
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,449
Of course not. That would be unethical.

144
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,210
What are we supposed to do?

145
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,682
Promote other websites to outrank
the bad Nucleus news?

146
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,569
Do you have any idea
how big a fucking job that is?

147
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,642
Don't you swear at me.

148
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,960
We don't work here anymore.

149
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,610
For 10 more days you do!

150
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,048
Unless you'd all like to quit and walk away
from your entire severance packages!

151
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,281
Amazing.

152
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,610
Whoa, whoa! Oh.

153
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,401
Jared. Whoa. What's up?

154
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,411
Hi. Um...

155
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,647
I'm sorry, I'm a little confused.
You were supposed to be out on Tuesday.

156
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,686
Oh, I was, but plans have changed.

157
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:32,563
See, I can't really afford to move or pay rent,
so I'm gonna have to stay a little while.

158
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,210
Okay, look, um...

159
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:39,411
I appreciate your situation,
but you're breaking the terms of our contract.

160
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,522
Listen, I don't want to be a dick,
it's just, I can't afford to live around here

161
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,490
'cause the rent is so high,
because of the tech companies, right?

162
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,927
And you bought this place
with the money you made

163
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,961
working at the tech companies,
so, it kind of all evens out, right?

164
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,047
That... That makes no sense.

165
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,884
I know. Right?

166
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,760
Okay, look, I can give you a few days,
uh, two weeks tops,

167
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:07,289
but if you're not out by then,
I'm gonna have to take legal action.

168
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,800
This bums me out, man.

169
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,291
I thought you were, like,
the one cool tech guy.

170
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,321
Me?

171
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,166
Are you sure?

172
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,480
Not anymore.

173
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,641
Well...

174
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:27,243
Well, the occupant of a residence in California
has almost unlimited rights.

175
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,926
I have to get his permission
to enter my property.

176
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,402
I can't turn off the power or the gas,
and I have to hire a lawyer

177
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,641
to start a legal eviction.

178
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,091
That won't be cheap.

179
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,686
Jeez, man. I'm sorry. That sucks.

180
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,410
So, where did you sleep last night?

181
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,006
I did not. How was your sleep?

182
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,004
Uh... It was good, yeah.

183
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,411
I mean, I slept like a stone.

184
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,285
It's odd not having to do
everything ourselves, isn't it?

185
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,608
Yeah, I'm, uh, I'm kind of loving it.

186
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,449
Hey, you ready to go to work?

187
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,602
Chef Amy asked us
what we wanted for breakfast,

188
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,250
and I said, "Surprise us."

189
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,685
Could be anything. Let's go!

190
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,922
When was the last time you saw those two

191
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,049
-go anywhere before noon?
-Indeed.

192
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,646
Well, let's go get some gluten-free waffles.

193
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,090
Sorry about the surprise.

194
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,049
- I don't care.
- I asked Chef Amy to tell me.

195
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,091
I have too many dietary restrictions
to leave breakfast to chance.

196
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,366
Makes sense.

197
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,444
Ah, two of my incubees off to eat the world.

198
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,761
Be well, work hard, and know one another.

199
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,167
Okay.

200
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,210
I recently helped them install
a new CEO at Pied Piper.

201
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,001
I needed to take a more hands-off approach,
focus on the future...

202
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:40,883
-Incubees, like yourself, with great ideas,
like cataloging malware.

203
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,166
Sexy.

204
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,447
Uh, would you care
for another coconut water?

205
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:49,208
They are the most expensive
unpasteurized variety, if that's any concern.

206
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,209
Actually, my concern is the room.

207
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,525
It's kind of a dump.

208
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,011
Oh, sure, now.

209
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,082
But, uh, with a new coat of paint,

210
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,323
you'll hardly recognize the place
when you move in next month.

211
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,609
Actually, uh, shit's pivoted.

212
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,170
I need a place next week.

213
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,129
Next week? Shit has pivoted.

214
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,885
Well, I'll talk to the current tenant.

215
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,362
Let him know that the time has come...

216
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,082
Mother fuck...

217
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,607
Uh... Yeah, put him on a slow boat
to China, so to speak.

218
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,887
I'm sorry. lt just slipped out.

219
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,849
I'll ask Chef Amy to make you something else.

220
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,410
No, no, no, I want waffles.

221
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,047
I just wanted them to be a surprise, Jared.
I wanted surprise waffles.

222
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,964
Who are these people?

223
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,250
Uh... I don't know.
Did Jack hire engineers already?

224
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,046
These people are not
in the engineering gene pool.

225
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,727
That's right, fellas.
These are our new sales people.

226
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,325
They're the best in the business.

227
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,645
Sales? Uh, Jack?

228
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,210
Jack?

229
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,489
Shouldn't we hire engineers
to build the platform

230
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,130
before we get people to sell it?

231
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,531
No. God, no!

232
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,641
The system, Richard.

233
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,930
Sales and engineering are the two pillars
of the Conjoined Triangles of Success.

234
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,169
- Yeah.
- Engineering and sales must work together

235
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,811
to decide what to build.

236
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,563
Who knows better what the customers need

237
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,564
than the people who actually deal
with the customers every single day?

238
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,165
We're all gonna meet at 1:00, Richard.

239
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,129
You're gonna love these guys.
They're the best.

240
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,604
So, while the Hooli lawsuit
did hamper our ability to get funding,

241
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,284
it did not slow down the engineering.

242
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,241
Yes, question?

243
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,765
Yeah, Keith, Northeast Regional.

244
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,287
So, you don't foresee
any technical debt issues

245
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,691
slowing our ability to scale?

246
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,208
Actually, no, uh, none whatsoever.

247
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:48,330
We've identified all our underlying issues,
and we have a plan in place for rapid growth.

248
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,201
Uh, yes?

249
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,206
Uh, Don, Global Accounts
and Systems Integration.

250
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,282
What kind of growth are you projecting here?

251
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:00,851
Uh... Well, this may sound a little bit
grandiose, but it's not unrealistic

252
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,766
to think that we have the potential
for worldwide penetration

253
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,889
on the scale of, say, Google or Facebook.

254
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,931
This is really great, Richard. Just keep going.

255
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,126
Sure. Yeah. Uh...

256
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,811
Well, in regards to the launch,

257
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,087
we are hoping to go wide, um,

258
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,208
get it into the hands
of as many people as possible.

259
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,727
Jan, Director, Inside Sales.
They call me "Jan the Man."

260
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,801
Oh.

261
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,201
When you say "people,"
you mean "companies," right?

262
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,806
- Yeah, we're business-facing.
- Okay, just wanted to clarify.

263
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,360
Actually, no. No, sorry, uh, Jan the Man.

264
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,246
By "people,"
I do mean "people." Humans. Consumers.

265
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,761
Uh, Keith, Northeast Regional, again.

266
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,290
Jack told us we would be selling
directly to businesses.

267
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,567
- He did?
- Doug. I'm shadowing Keith.

268
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,162
- Yes, he did.
- Definitely. I was there. Don, again.

269
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:55,803
Well, I'm sorry for the misunderstanding,
because, um, the plan has always been

270
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:00,051
um, entirely based on the freemium model,
like Dropbox?

271
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,124
You know, you give the platform away free
to consumers,

272
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,521
and then once you have
a big enough user-base,

273
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,001
then you sell premium services to businesses.

274
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,846
If we're giving it away now
and waiting until later to sell it,

275
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,605
what are we doing here now?

276
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,525
- I don't know. I don't know.
- We could maybe ask, uh, Jack

277
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,206
when he gets back, uh, from wherever...

278
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,051
Sorry, one second. Just one moment.

279
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,724
Jack. Sorry, Jack.

280
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,851
Sorry. Excuse me, Jack. Uh, are you leaving?

281
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,367
Oh, I have this charity wine thing.

282
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,365
Sorry, I committed to it months ago,
but you are killing it in there, Richard.

283
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,167
Uh... Well, actually no.

284
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,280
Sorry. They just said that you told them
that we would be business-facing?

285
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,727
Oh, they filled you in. That's good.

286
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,963
I was under the impression that
we would be consumer first.

287
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,724
My guys are pretty set on that.

288
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,088
Richard, I read your deck,

289
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,209
and you project it'll be four years
until we get to revenue?

290
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,571
Uh... Yeah.

291
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,246
You know we're in a bubble right now, right?

292
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,926
Or maybe you don't know.
You weren't around for the last bubble.

293
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,445
You were probably in diapers.

294
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,287
- I was 11.
- Well, I wasn't in diapers.

295
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,011
I don't... I wasn't either.

296
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,764
- I was there.
- Mmm-hmm.

297
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,162
And in March of 2000, do you know
when a four-year plan ended?

298
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,524
April of 2000.

299
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,931
We gotta move, now.

300
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,331
We can't put all of our eggs

301
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,971
in the pot-of-gold-at-the-end-
of-the-rainbow basket.

302
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,126
So, the pot of gold is in the basket?

303
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,444
Richard, these are
the best salespeople in the world,

304
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,046
and when they tell me
that business-facing is the play,

305
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,531
I gotta listen to that, okay?

306
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,967
- That's fair, but it's...
- I'm just asking you

307
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:50,125
to talk to your guys about modifying
your platform for enterprise.

308
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,044
I mean, just see how it feels, okay?

309
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,726
And no matter what happens,
I promise you this.

310
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,042
I will never compromise the product.

311
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,963
Okay. Okay.

312
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:04,125
Uh, fine, I will talk to my guys,
but they're not gonna be happy about it.

313
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,009
No, of course not. They're engineers.

314
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,571
I'll see you later.

315
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:11,890
I realize this is a Japanese tradition
and that you are Chinese.

316
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,803
I'm not racist.

317
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,930
Yes, Japanese people racist.
They are horrible.

318
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,480
No. No, no.

319
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:25,401
Jian-Yang, in every relationship,
there are ebbs and flows.

320
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,850
- Ebbs?
- Yes.

321
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,251
And although we have flowed,

322
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:33,484
our relationship now
has come to a permanent ebbing.

323
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,246
- Flow.
- No. No.

324
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,965
We have come to a permanent ebb.

325
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,166
Do you understand?

326
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,528
So, you want me to leave the house?

327
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,046
Yes. Yes. Very much so.

328
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,321
And so, I thank you for our today.

329
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,721
Now you bow.

330
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,046
Bow.

331
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,451
All the way to the waist.

332
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,481
No.

333
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,921
Okay.

334
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,486
Thank you, Erlich.

335
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,090
Goodbye, little one. I'm gonna miss you.

336
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:22,647
Can't say it wasn't fun, Jian-Yang,
you little Cantonese bastard.

337
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,007
- Hey, you like this?
- What are you doing?

338
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,007
Hi, my name's Erlich Bachman.
I'm a lying fuck!

339
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,565
Who... Who are you yelling at?

340
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,530
We're the only two people
in the fucking house!

341
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,045
Erlich a liar!

342
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,810
You're not gonna get me to change
my opinion about myself.

343
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,847
- Liar!
- Take that outta there.

344
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,606
I don't know, Richard.
I don't think it's that big a deal.

345
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,081
Really, you don't?
You're okay with being business first?

346
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,322
Granted, it's not what we would do
if we were in charge,

347
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,721
but, you know,
Jack seems to know what he's doing.

348
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,605
This is fucking amazing.

349
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,284
<i>I feel</i> like <i>I'm in Minority Report.</i>

350
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,761
And in reality, you're just a minority.

351
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,446
Richard, relax.
We're still building the neural net.

352
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,648
We still get to do all the cool stuff, right?

353
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,846
Yeah, of course.

354
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,241
We're not scrapping
any peer-to-peer delivery?

355
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,084
No, no, definitely not.

356
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,606
So, we're still doing the same stuff,
just in a different order.

357
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,364
Yeah, I guess you're right.

358
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,683
Well, the eviction process
is officially underway,

359
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,844
but my attorney says it may take up to a year.

360
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,566
- Where are you gonna stay?
- Well, I always have my trick.

361
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,290
All right, I'll bite. What's your trick?

362
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,684
I simply imagine that my skeleton is me,

363
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:36,130
and my body is my house,
and that way, I'm always home.

364
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:43,285
Okay. Well, uh, we are now business-facing.
I don't know if you heard.

365
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,966
That means we have
to rewrite our entire deck.

366
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,963
I just hope it doesn't
put us way the fuck behind.

367
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,283
Behind who? EndFrame sucks
and Nucleus shit the bed, remember?

368
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,204
Yeah, yeah.
You're right, you're right.

369
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,721
Wow.

370
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,641
This is endless.

371
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,643
If we'd worked this hard
on Nucleus in the first place,

372
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,484
we probably wouldn't
be scrubbing it right now.

373
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,328
- Dude, are you done?
- Yup.

374
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,289
How'd your script digest
all those strings so fast?

375
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,681
I don't know. It's just a predictive loop.

376
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,922
Actually, it's sort of like a context tree.

377
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,886
Holy shit.

378
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,081
What's up?

379
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,282
Hey, Jared, why don't we knock off for tonight

380
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,845
and just pick this back up tomorrow morning.

381
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,365
Mmm. Agreed.

382
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,728
I'm going on close to 40 hours
without good sleep,

383
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,486
and the edges of things
are starting to get a little dancey.

384
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,210
What?

385
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,567
Erlich, thank you again
for allowing me to occupy

386
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,722
a corner of your cozy garage.

387
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,609
It is my hearth and my home.

388
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,450
What the fuck?

389
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,325
Jian-Yang, Jesus Christ.

390
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,767
Don't sneak up on people like that,
you devious little bastard,

391
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,047
especially if they're cleaning glassware.

392
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:06,921
You kick me out, but you let him stay.
He's not even an incubee.

393
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,526
No, he's not, and he's not staying
in the house.

394
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,127
He's in the garage,
like a sad bag of potting soil.

395
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,406
Have some compassion.

396
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,121
I mean, the guy rented his place
to some fuckhead tenant who won't leave.

397
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,362
Jared is fucked, Jian-Yang.

398
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,885
He can go to the police.

399
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,567
It's useless. California law gives landlords,
literally, no recourse.

400
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,802
So, he can go to court.

401
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,447
Of course, he's going to go to court,
you four-eyed turd.

402
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,246
But in America, the legal system
doesn't work very well,

403
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,120
so it will take at least a year
for the proceedings to even begin.

404
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,690
Do you understand that?

405
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,201
Yes. I stay here for one year.

406
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,487
I pay no rent. You have no recourse.

407
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,326
That's not always the case.

408
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,129
I mean, sometimes court systems
can move faster,

409
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,124
-especially if you have the money for...
- I'm going to smoke in my room.

410
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,248
- Special occasion.
- Oh. Mother fuck.

411
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,171
If we stack that same loop on top
of the bit-level encoder

412
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,571
that we took from Hendricks,

413
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,690
and then we tethered it to the routine
we were trying to use...

414
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,808
That would be a huge jump in speed.

415
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,927
This is mega.

416
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,162
This is what Hendricks did
at TechCrunch Disrupt.

417
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,888
I think we just cracked middle-out.

418
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,841
We should probably tell Gavin, right?

419
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,122
Why? He fired us.

420
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,366
You know how much we could get paid
if we took this somewhere else?

421
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,169
Fuck off.

422
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,120
Okay, let me get this straight.

423
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,488
First you talked me
into going business-facing,

424
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:41,201
and now you want to eliminate the entire
neural net from the platform?

425
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,809
Jan, Director, Inside Sales.
They call me "Jan the Man."

426
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,564
Yes, we know, "Jan the Man."

427
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,361
Listen, uh, we have to do neural net
for deep learning.

428
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,647
Look, once we get enough data
flowing through the system,

429
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,770
it will be able to recognize
long-range patterns and actually learn.

430
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,810
It will be able to optimize our algorithm
on its own,

431
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:02,049
increasing our already
superior speed and efficiency.

432
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,248
Right? Pretty cool, huh?

433
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,846
But it won't be able to do that if we delete it.

434
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,729
- Do you get that?
- But you just said it.

435
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,371
It requires a central repository of data, right?

436
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,771
Businesses want to protect their data.

437
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,888
They're huge pussies
when it comes to security.

438
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,644
Okay, well, we're not cutting
machine learning. We're not.

439
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,927
If we cut that, we might as well cut
peer-to-peer delivery,

440
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,241
and all the efficiencies of the cloud.

441
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,930
Are those still in?

442
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,365
No, those have to go also.

443
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,771
- What?
- Keith, by the way.

444
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,604
I know your name, okay?
I know everybody's name.

445
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:32,481
Look, uh, we can't cut everything about
this platform that makes it revolutionary

446
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,927
just because that's a little harder for you guys
to sell, all right?

447
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,606
If we want to sell out,
let's just sell all the way out.

448
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,883
Let's just take the algorithm,
jam it into a metal fucking box,

449
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,644
stick it in the back
of a data center somewhere,

450
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,324
so it can't connect to anything,

451
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,926
and it just sits there
and no one even knows it's there.

452
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,531
Doug, still shadowing Keith.

453
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,647
When you say "metal box,"

454
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,961
you're talking about a rack-mounted
server-type appliance?

455
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:58,648
No, no, no. lam using it
as a rhetorical example of a bad idea.

456
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,925
That's fucking stupid.

457
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,401
Oh, my God.

458
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,005
I just need to find Jack. One second.

459
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,808
- Where's Jack?
- He had to go meet his vet.

460
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,488
His vet? In the middle of the day?
Okay, uh, well, what's the vet's address?

461
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,244
Jack, excuse me. Do you mind telling me...

462
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,966
Holy shit. What is that?

463
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,646
- Oh, mother of God.
- Richard, what are you doing here?

464
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,081
What do you mean? It's 2:30.
What are you doing here?

465
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:33,290
My number one breeding mare went into heat.
Sorry, she's not much for schedules.

466
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,407
Oh, God.

467
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,202
Thoroughbreds, Richard. Natural cover only.

468
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,248
Now, you don't see that very often, do you?

469
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,321
Nope.Uh“.

470
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,285
I had a meeting...
I had a meeting with the sales guys

471
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,243
and, uh, Jan the Man...

472
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,970
Uh... You know what? Can we talk over here?
This is just hard for me.

473
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,450
Look, Jack, uh, you and I have a problem.

474
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,888
Okay, your salespeople are telling me
to cut everything cool about the platform

475
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,566
just because it's a little bit harder
for them to sell.

476
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:12,043
But don't you think,
because they are such amazing salespeople,

477
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:16,603
that it would be okay for them to sell
the harder stuff?

478
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,047
No. It doesn't work that way.

479
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,364
The way you keep the best salespeople is,
you need to give 'em something easy to sell.

480
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,450
Otherwise, they'd just go somewhere else.

481
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,808
Okay, well, uh, Pied Piper
could honestly be the global standard

482
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,405
for file compression and storage.

483
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,963
Every mobile device on the face of the planet
could be able to access their data

484
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,520
as if they had a fiber optic cable
plugged into it.

485
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,444
People in the desert,
people in refugee camps,

486
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,729
people who have nothing
could suddenly have access to everything.

487
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,163
You know, everybody in this industry,

488
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,481
they say they want to make this world
a better place,

489
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,324
but we could actually do it.

490
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,971
We could do it and make billions of dollars.

491
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,680
- Richard, listen...
- No, you listen to me, Jack.

492
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,321
You promised me that you would
never compromise the product.

493
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,404
So, do you feel like taking some action
and backing me up on this,

494
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,922
because me and my product
feel pretty fucking compromised right now.

495
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,368
Richard, I don't think you understand
what the product is.

496
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,729
The product isn't the platform,
and the product isn't your algorithm, either.

497
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,450
And it's not even the software.

498
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,411
Do you know what
Pied Piper's product is, Richard?

499
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,126
Is...

500
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,641
Is it me?

501
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,209
Oh, God! No!

502
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,841
No. How could it possibly be you?
You got fired.

503
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,526
Pied Piper's product is its stock.

504
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,241
Its stock?

505
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,011
And whatever makes
the value of that stock go up,

506
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,889
that is what we are going to make.

507
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,724
And maybe sometime in the future,

508
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,167
we could change the world
and perform miracles,

509
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,607
and all of that stuff, and I hope we do.

510
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,886
But, like I told you before,

511
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,849
I'm not going to mortgage
the present for that.

512
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,729
I need to move the needle today.

513
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,765
And now, if you will excuse me.

514
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:57,528
I paid $150,000 for the semen
that's about to come out of that stallion,

515
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,250
and I would very much like to be there

516
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,731
to see that it happens.

517
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,928
- Oh. Hey, Richard!
- Yes?

518
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,403
I just got a text from Keith,
Northeast Regional.

519
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,130
He says the guys love your idea.

520
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,086
What idea?

521
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,291
It's a <i>big</i> world,

522
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,523
<i>but thanks to modern technology,
it's smaller than ever.</i>

523
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,001
<i>Today, business moves at the speed of light.</i>

524
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,767
<i>You can access your company's data
anywhere, anytime.</i>

525
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,367
<i>But if you can get your data,
who else can get it?</i>

526
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:31,769
<i>Spies, thieves, criminals, and foreigners.</i>

527
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,644
<i>What if there was a way to take all
of your company's data</i>

528
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:40,487
<i>and back it up in a protected enclosure
completely isolated from the world at large?</i>

529
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,840
Oh, no.

530
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,969
<i>The ultimate enterprise
data storage solution.</i>

531
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,042
<i>Think inside the box.

532
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,247
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

533
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,962
This is the game we're playing, team,
so, let's win it!

534
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,806
You guys, check it out.

535
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,601
Chef Amy hollowed out a watermelon
and filled it with watermelon Jell-O!

536
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,523
Look, that's actual rind.

537
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,571
The fuck is that? Is that a VCR?

538
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,649
Why does it say "Pied Piper" on it?

539
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,131
Why is everybody so happy?
