00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,926
<i>FEMALE NARRATOR'. Tables.</i>

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,322
<i>Tables are made so a person
can sit down and do something.</i>

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,323
<i>Or nothing.</i>

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,209
<i>Any person can sit at a table,</i>

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,931
<i>and if the table
is large enough, many people.</i>

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,049
<i>To make jokes, eat a meal, tell stories.</i>

7
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,044
<i>Tables are for people
to be together and share.</i>

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,044
<i>And that is why tables are like Pied Piper.</i>

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,044
<i>Grapefruits, postcards, hugs.</i>

10
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,487
<i>These are things people share
to connect, to become closer.</i>

11
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,689
<i>To open up about ideas and things
that make us feel alive,</i>

12
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,561
<i>like air, ballet, amazing haircuts,
weird countries,</i>

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,441
<i>three-alarm chili, mountains,
continents, the Earth, life.</i>

14
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,923
<i>Life is beautiful and sad
and hopeful and dangerous.</i>

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,843
<i>So maybe the reason we share so much</i>

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,241
<i>is because we understand
that without sharing,</i>

17
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,049
<i>we can't survive.</i>

18
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,401
<i>And sharing is tables.</i>

19
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,323
<i>Pied Piper.</i>

20
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,246
Yes. Tables. I see. It's a metaphor.

21
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,681
- It's a wonderful ad spot.
- Yeah. We're all just tables.

22
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,205
I love what you've done with the place.

23
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,284
It's a really nicely done place.

24
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,448
Say, is that your dog?

25
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,842
It's a dog.

26
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,761
You and I have never really
had much of a rapport, have we?

27
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,329
It's wanting.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,047
Oh, look.

29
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,205
Well, we're almost there.
Prepare to gather, everyone.

30
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,763
No, I didn't say to gather.
I simply said prepare to gather.

31
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,170
- Monica, hey.
- Oh, hey. How's it going?

32
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,368
- You holding up okay?
- Not really.

33
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,488
I know. Her parties are always deeply weird.

34
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,087
Hey, um, I guess this is as good a time
as any to say it,

35
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,290
but I'm really sorry for not getting Pied Piper.

36
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,729
And to be honest, it's really embarrassing
to be so fucking wrong.

37
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,963
Well, here's the thing, you might not be.

38
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,883
What? What are you talking about?

39
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,121
Uh...

40
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,127
Okay.

41
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,683
So, well, Pied Piper launches
and everything's great,

42
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,401
and we spent a fucking bazillion dollars,
on the tables ad

43
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,690
and now we are almost
at 500,000 installs, right?

44
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,286
- Yeah. What's the problem?
- Well, as you know,

45
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,806
installs isn't really the metric that matters.

46
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,049
We need daily active users,
people who come back to the platform.

47
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,487
Okay, so how many daily users
do you actually have?

48
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,005
Okay, what would... What would be a number

49
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,481
that would make you say,
"Oh, that's bad."

50
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,771
I don't know, like, 100,000?

51
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,161
Oh...

52
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,321
Are you less?

53
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,050
How much less?

54
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,730
- Nineteen thousand.
- Nineteen thousand less than a...

55
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,849
- Eighty-one thousand?
- No. No, just 19,000.

56
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,843
- That's the only number.
- What?

57
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,764
- That's... That's terrible.
- Yeah. I'm aware.

58
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,207
- Well, yeah, that's art, not a chair.
- Uh... Oh.

59
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,441
Richard! Oh, my...

60
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,204
Wait, you haven't told Laurie yet, have you?

61
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,282
- No.
- Okay. Well, who else knows?

62
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,810
- Dinesh and Gilfoyle?
- No.

63
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,566
Erlich?

64
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,721
No.

65
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,482
Well, apparently Jared knows.

66
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,406
Yeah, Pied Piper's sort of what I'm known for,

67
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,882
but I'm into a lot of cool stuff.

68
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,644
Like, a lot.

69
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,007
You seem surprised.

70
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,208
I'll give you an example. A few months ago,

71
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,169
I'm at my computer, freestyling,

72
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,890
just kind of jammin' out, you know.

73
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,645
Before I knew it, I had thrown together

74
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,690
the greatest video-chat app
the world has ever seen.

75
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,367
So you invented Skype a few months ago?

76
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,091
Great ideas just sort of flow through me.

77
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,925
The platform, you know,
it's sort of a group project,

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,402
but the video-chat app, that's my solo album.

79
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,960
- Oh, Robert.
- I'm Dinesh.

80
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,089
What the fuck is going on with you?

81
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,161
Hmm?

82
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,683
Could you be more specific?

83
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,646
You're hiding something.

84
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,848
What? No, I'm not.

85
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,649
Everything's fine.
You know, everything's fine.

86
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,449
That's a lie.

87
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,443
I could tell because you subscribe

88
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,411
to traditional Judeo-Christian
mores of right and wrong.

89
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,289
You're made uncomfortable by untruth.

90
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,446
My commitment to LaVeyan Satanism
grants me certain freedoms.

91
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,524
There is no good and evil, there's only self.

92
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,971
- Would you like a beverage?
- Yes, I would.

93
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,203
Lie. You just want me to go
to the bar and leave you alone.

94
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,486
Gil... You crack me up.

95
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,527
Lie.

96
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,369
I terrify you, as I should.

97
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,722
Get out of here.

98
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,285
Okay, thank you.

99
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,885
Okay, so, I just spoke with my friend
who runs a market research firm.

100
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,724
- Mmm-hmm.
- She's gonna set up a focus group

101
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,770
for the platform,
put it in the hands of some real users,

102
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,763
and hopefully it'll be super-obvious
what's going wrong.

103
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,486
- Okay, great.
- Clink, clink, clink. Gather.

104
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,483
Faster, please. Gather faster. We're close.

105
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,403
We need to see the numbers change.

106
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,324
499,995,

107
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,803
499,996...

108
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,886
499,997...

109
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,761
It's going great.

110
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,491
They've been engaging with the platform
for about an hour now.

111
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,369
- They're just starting the Q and A.
- Oh, great.

112
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,488
Thank you, everyone,
for sharing your feelings

113
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,166
on the revolutionary new Pied Piper platform.

114
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,722
Now, Bernice, you say here that you were,

115
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,049
"Totally freaked out by the platform."

116
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,566
What specifically totally freaked you out?

117
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,685
Everything. Just every single thing about it.

118
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,364
<i>Just, like, how it worked.</i>

119
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:19,128
Now, who else found themselves
totally freaked out by this platform?

120
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,124
Barry, Warren, Natalie, Martina,

121
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,283
Gwen, Amy, Walker and Clay.

122
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,488
<i>You were all totally freaked out.</i>

123
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,968
Was anyone not totally freaked out?

124
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,411
Clark? Good. What was your reaction?

125
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,881
It just made me feel stupid.

126
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,002
<i>This file sync thing is confusing.</i>

127
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,243
<i>When I put videos into my main folder,
it says it uploaded them,</i>

128
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,402
but then I didn't see where they went.

129
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,528
It said stuff was on my phone and my iPad,

130
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,967
but when I looked at the memory,
it said, "Zero K used,"

131
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,724
so stuff wasn't on there.

132
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,527
That's the platform.
He's describing the platform

133
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,722
and what's great about it.
Well, clearly he doesn't get it.

134
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,406
Clearly, none of these people get it.
Maybe this is a bad group.

135
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,967
This is the fifth one today
and it's the least hostile reaction we've seen.

136
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:06,090
Okay, well, everyone that I showed
the beta to loved it. Loved.

137
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,527
- Oh, shit.
- What?

138
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,806
Who did you give the beta to?

139
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,362
- Your friends. Engineers.
- Well, yeah, Monica.

140
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,488
I wanted to give it to people
who would understand

141
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,166
what I'm trying to do,
so I could get useful feedback.

142
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,730
And with all due respect, I gave it to you,

143
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,689
the one person
without a computing background,

144
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,001
and you said it felt engineered.

145
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,803
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah.

146
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,723
You're trying to sell
the platform to regular people,

147
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,407
but you never actually put it
in the hands of regular people.

148
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,641
Like them.

149
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,609
<i>Shouldn't there be a download button?</i>

150
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,162
Did they honestly forget
to add a download button?

151
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,006
You know what, Richard,
why don't we just go...

152
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,484
I mean, who designed this thing?

153
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,801
I did. I designed it.

154
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,730
Excuse me? Who are you?

155
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,927
Uh, my name is Richard Hendricks,
I'm the CEO of Pied Piper.

156
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,047
Oh, my God.

157
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,083
Oh, you're the one

158
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,810
who forgot the download button.

159
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,207
Yes.

160
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,566
But no. No, actually,
there is no download button because, well,

161
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,483
you don't need a download button.
We're past that.

162
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,050
I mean, that's the old thing.
This guy, actually,

163
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,485
he should have told you that.

164
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,130
I'm a moderator, not an advocate.

165
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,168
Okay, well, with Pied Piper,

166
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,891
you don't need to download anything
or send anything at all,

167
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,681
anywhere, because the second
you take a photo or a video

168
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,481
or compose a text message,
it's on all of your devices instantly.

169
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,688
- So it's all on my phone?
- Yes.

170
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,684
Wrong! It says, "Zero K used."
So it's not on there.

171
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,761
Ah-ha!

172
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,766
Yes, well, that's the best part
about the platform right there.

173
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,526
Yes, because you're right,
it's not actually on the phone.

174
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,809
But you don't need it to be on the phone

175
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,531
if you can see it on the phone,

176
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,967
even though there's nothing there at all.

177
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,486
But... Where the hell is it?

178
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,721
Everywhere.

179
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,121
And nowhere, sort of.

180
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,928
Let me... Let me just take a step back here

181
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,765
and explain it in a simpler way.

182
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,524
- Um, sorry, what was your name?
- Bernice.

183
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,887
Bernice, what did you
have for breakfast today?

184
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,645
- Scrambled eggs.
- Scrambled eggs.

185
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,722
And what's in the eggs?

186
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,529
Electrons. Right?

187
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,604
And we all know how
electrons exist in orbitals.

188
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,762
<i>Multivalent states? No?</i>

189
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,161
No one knows this? Okay.

190
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,561
Okay, that's fine. Bad example. That's on me.

191
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,722
I'll... I'm going to use the whiteboard here.

192
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,007
<i>You're gonna... You're gonna love this. Okay.</i>

193
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,605
Then, once we hit a critical mass of users,

194
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,570
the volume of data
moving through the system

195
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,042
will enable the neural net
to start optimizing the platform.

196
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,249
It will actually get smarter
and faster all on its own.

197
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,924
Is that like when I'm texting

198
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,321
and my phone starts guessing
what I'm going to say?

199
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,164
This goes way beyond autocomplete.

200
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,040
Actually, all of your devices
will begin helping each other

201
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,168
in ways that we can't even design or predict.

202
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,848
Okay, but see, the problem is...

203
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,921
<i>Terminator.</i>

204
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,603
What? No. No, no.
No, no, no. No.

205
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,446
I can assure you that there is no
Skynet type of situation here.

206
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:08,206
No. Pied Piper will in no way become sentient
and try to take over the world.

207
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,922
He just told us he couldn't predict it.

208
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,049
I'm just saying... Everybody died.

209
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,441
- Yeah.
- You're right.

210
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,002
In those movies,
there were a lot of casualties.

211
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,961
Quite scary to think. It's food for thought.

212
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,610
Speaking of...

213
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,330
<i>Can we order some pizzas in here?</i>

214
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,086
So, when we put our files
into a Pied Piper folder,

215
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,049
they get split up into tiny bits

216
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,728
and spread across a network
of other users' devices?

217
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,929
Yes, that's
peer-to-peer distribution. Continue.

218
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,809
But they can't look at any of our files

219
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,407
because they only have tiny,
scrambled pieces of them?

220
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,687
- Encrypted sharding.
- Clark with the assist. Great.

221
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,287
- Uh, go on.
- But we can look at any of our files anytime,

222
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,604
anywhere, even though they're not
actually on any of our devices.

223
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,841
Yes. Yes, Bernice, that's it.

224
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,922
That's Pied Piper. That's everything.

225
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,243
So it's all on our phones
even though it sort of isn't.

226
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,800
Oh, my God. That's awesome.

227
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,291
Isn't it? Yeah.

228
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,085
So, what do you think?
Will you use Pied Piper now?

229
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,686
- Well, yeah, I think I will.
- Me, too,

230
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,525
-now that you've explained how it works.
- There you go.

231
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,443
That's what we've been aiming for.

232
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,406
<i>They get it.</i>

233
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,209
What's he smiling at?

234
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,284
This data was corrupted
the second he walked in that room.

235
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,802
So we're tanking,
and it's because we're too good.

236
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,601
That's one way of looking at it. Uh, yes.

237
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,126
Yes, we have created a product
so far ahead of its time,

238
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,283
people are having difficulty
wrapping their heads around it.

239
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,045
Well, then we just need
to change the platform, right?

240
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,851
- We simplify it.
- Well, we can't.

241
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,447
It's not as if I don't want to,
it's just that we literally can't do it.

242
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,885
Um, if you build an airplane and people
are afraid of anything that flies,

243
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,769
you can't just take the wings off of it because,

244
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:04,687
at that point, all you're left with
is a really slow, super-expensive shitty bus.

245
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,125
No, we built an airplane, we gotta fly it.

246
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,885
What's the point of flying
if it's fucking empty?

247
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,082
I think people will want to fly

248
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,243
once they realize how cool the platform is.

249
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,448
Guys, I know we're in a tough spot right now,

250
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,126
and I know we needed a quarter-million DAUs

251
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,407
in order to get our next round of funding,
but this is it.

252
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,925
I think we can do this.

253
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,924
All we gotta do is just take
every last dollar that we have,

254
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,923
which is... Sorry, Jared, what?

255
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,209
Well, after the table ads...

256
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,806
...the salaries, recruiter fees...

257
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,410
You know what? I haven't run the numbers.

258
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,608
It would be irresponsible to estimate.

259
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,763
Okay, is it less than a million dollars?

260
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,889
- Oh, God, yeah.
- Okay.

261
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,850
- It's higher than 500,000, right?
- Yeah.

262
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:54,481
I guess it's about $697,240.

263
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,050
But don't quote me on that.

264
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,682
Okay, we use that money
to do outreach, tutorials,

265
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,885
user meet-ups,
create a guerrilla marketing campaign

266
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,043
that explains how cool the platform is.

267
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,045
I know it's not ideal, but I really think
we can pull this off.

268
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,804
Yeah, that seems doable.

269
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,166
Lie.

270
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,290
Or here's another idea.
We could put the platform on hold,

271
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,290
take the money we have left,
and pivot to something

272
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,886
that doesn't require hours of explanation.

273
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,290
You know, I've been showing
people the video-chat app

274
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,091
-that I hacked together and...
- Shut up, Dinesh!

275
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,888
You ungrateful pricks, all of you.

276
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:39,321
Your tepid response to our intrepid boss
makes me ill.

277
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,526
His plan, will it work? Mmm-mmm.

278
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,044
Almost certainly not.

279
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,930
All of you will likely look back
at this time in your lives

280
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,800
and realize you wasted a whole year
with nothing to show for it.

281
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,521
But if this company is a plane,
then this is Richard's goddamn plane,

282
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,365
and if he wants to fly it
into the side of a fucking mountain,

283
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,041
that is his prerogative
and it is our duty to climb on,

284
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,489
strap in and have a fiery death
right behind him.

285
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,400
I don't...
I don't know about that, but...

286
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,528
Richard, the floor.

287
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,968
Crashing aside, I think this is the plan, and,

288
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,890
really, what other option do we have?

289
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,883
Well, I know what option I have.

290
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,121
I can quit.

291
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,921
So I quit.

292
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,811
Okay. Any... Anybody else?

293
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,165
Guys, no.

294
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,288
Look, Douglas,

295
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,362
customer support is going
to be a big part of this.

296
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,250
We need you guys
if we're going to get 250,000 users.

297
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,243
I barely have any customers
to support, Richard.

298
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,049
And the only way
you're going to get that many users

299
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,329
is if you go to one of those click farms
in Bangladesh and pay for them.

300
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,170
Good fuckin' luck, man. I'm out.

301
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,965
- Guys, wait.
- Jared, let them go.

302
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,849
I have to do their exit interviews.

303
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,161
I guess I can do them
on their walk to their cars.

304
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,286
Richard, we're better off without them.

305
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,566
Lie.

306
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,326
This is intolerable.
A man can only take so much.

307
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,921
- Mmm-hmm.
- Banished from my own company? No.

308
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,809
I'm just going to give them what they want.

309
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,006
I'm going to resign.

310
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,930
We can go to Haiti, build orphanages.

311
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,331
Haiti?

312
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,808
Is it not said that one should
think globally and act locally?

313
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,405
I'm not acting at all.

314
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,006
Lao Tzu teaches
the best fighter is never angry.

315
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,641
More important than the blow
is knowing when to strike.

316
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,281
Like, perhaps, after we experience

317
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,603
the executive white water
rafting trip in Coeur D'Alene?

318
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,610
Gavin, do you have a moment?

319
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,040
Yes.

320
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,841
Alone?

321
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,640
Of course. Denpok?

322
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,721
What?

323
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,845
Give us a moment, please?

324
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,565
Gavin, I'm really not
supposed to be talking to you,

325
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,449
but there's something
I think you should know about.

326
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,887
I'm listening.

327
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,123
A customer service rep
that just left Pied Piper

328
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,607
is on campus right now
interviewing for a job.

329
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,931
Why would anyone leave Pied Piper now?

330
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,691
I thought maybe
you'd want to ask him yourself.

331
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,761
Well done.

332
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,561
Well done.

333
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,051
Okay. Thank you for coming in, Douglas.

334
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,804
- Yeah.
- Right this way. Okay.

335
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,761
Uh...

336
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,761
Douglas.

337
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,970
Consider the possum. Nature's...

338
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,611
Gavin, if you're bringing another animal
into this boardroom,

339
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,480
-this meeting is over.
- Of course not. Don't insult me.

340
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,250
Gentlemen and lady of the Hooli board,

341
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,210
I am the possum to which I refer.

342
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,851
Playing dead to outwit those
who wish me harm.

343
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,285
But it's time to end the charade.

344
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,408
I'm sorry, Gavin. What charade?

345
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,530
For months, I've led the world to believe
that my EndFrame division was pursuing

346
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,685
a broad-based compression platform
in direct competition with Pied Piper.

347
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:16,442
But secretly, I knew that any such platform
was destined to fail.

348
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,648
But Pied Piper is not failing.

349
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,007
It's the most popular app in the Hooli store.

350
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,560
One of the most installed, yes.

351
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,928
But I happen to know, because
I make it my business to know,

352
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,606
that their daily active user numbers
are abysmal.

353
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,448
So, you were never developing a platform.

354
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,010
Why didn't you tell us this?

355
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,449
Says the chairperson of the board
that recently asked for my resignation.

356
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,648
Trust cuts both ways.

357
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,166
I thought it best to leave you out of it.

358
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,730
I'm sorry, Gavin,

359
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,007
I'm just finding all of this
impossible to believe.

360
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,924
If you were never building a platform,

361
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,606
what did we just spend
three-quarters of a billion dollars on?

362
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,850
I'm not going to tell you.

363
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,927
Instead, I'm going to let
the new head of product

364
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,650
for Hooli/EndFrame tell you.

365
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,209
Hello, everyone.

366
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,170
I'm Jack Barker, and I'm very excited

367
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,926
to introduce Hooli/EndFrame's
newest product...

368
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,607
We call it The Box.

369
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,687
Pied Piper's loss is Hooli's gain.

370
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,690
May the best product win.

371
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,563
Can I get you a shirt, sir? There you go.

372
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,530
<i>Actually, let me ask you a question, Emily.</i>

373
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,443
<i>What did you have for breakfast today?</i>

374
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,409
<i>- Um, yogurt.
- Okay.</i>

375
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,211
<i>And we all know what's in yogurt, right?</i>

376
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,647
<i>Electrons. Multivalent states.</i>

377
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,686
Welcome to the Pied Piper
Informational Seminar.

378
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,611
Now, what is Pied Piper? Excellent question.

379
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,480
Here it is.

380
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,961
One of your Hooli/EndFrame boxes
would go right here in this rack.

381
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,486
Okay, let me show you the next location

382
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,562
in which we would install one of your boxes.

383
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,850
- Congratulations, Jack.
- And congratulations to you, Gavin.

384
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,571
- Hey, John? John?
- John?

385
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,329
A lot of people have raised their hands

386
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,085
throughout this seminar saying,
"Hey, is this thing like the Terminator?"

387
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,208
Uh, no. Not at all.

388
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,203
Hi, how big are your files?

389
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,169
Dodge Challenger?

390
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,241
Hoodie?

391
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,364
- John?
- Yo!

392
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,761
- John?
- John!

393
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,808
John!

394
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,044
This is Pied Piper, guys, okay?

395
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,770
If I could just explain it one more time.

396
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,691
Guys? Please don't leave. I beg you.

397
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,442
Hi, Bernice. Yeah.

398
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,726
We kind of thought
we nailed it with tables,

399
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,247
but you say you want something
light, fun, inviting.

400
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,848
But most of all, you want something
that delivers

401
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,208
a step-by-step guide
to all of the nuances of your platform.

402
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,884
- Yeah.
- All of this with the caveat that

403
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,611
you don't have enough money
for even a minuscule ad buy.

404
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,801
Yes, that's right.

405
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,009
That's a pretty small target to hit.

406
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,322
Anyway, here's what we came up with.

407
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,320
<i>Oh, hello, welcome to Pied Piper.</i>

408
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,970
<i>How can I help you?</i>

409
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,687
What in the name of fuck is that?

410
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,411
Well, his name is

411
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,131
Pipey, the Pied Piper piper.

412
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,921
He's fun. And, you know,
the demo's interactive.

413
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,206
Just...

414
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,328
<i>Looks like you want to compress a movie file!</i>

415
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,643
<i>Can I help? You know,
with Pied Piper's revolutionary</i>

416
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,281
<i>neural network, optimized,
sharded data distribution system,</i>

417
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,684
<i>it's just six clicks away! Follow me!</i>

418
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,450
- I like it.
- That's a fuckin' lie.

419
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,567
Yeah.

420
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,406
So, Richard, you want us
to take the most sophisticated

421
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,324
and technically complex
compression-based platform

422
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,086
- ever created and add that?
<i>- Still</i> here!

423
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,561
Well, after the booths
at CES and South by Southwest,

424
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,689
- all of our outreach, the Dodge Challenger...
<i>- Still</i> here!

425
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,481
Plus, all the cost of working up,
you know, this,

426
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:51,246
-we are pretty much all out of money.
- Follow me!

427
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,285
Okay.

428
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,765
<i>Uh-oh. Somebody seems confused!</i>

429
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,922
<i>Let me walk you through
Pied Piper's proprietary</i>

430
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,571
<i>peer-to-peer content distribution system.</i>

431
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,167
Richard? Are you indisposed?

432
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,810
Richard, can I come in?

433
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,931
Richard, I'm sorry the guys didn't like Pipey.

434
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,046
It's over, Jared.

435
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,925
Well, you know, a lot of animated characters
have rough starts.

436
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,810
Early Bugs Bunny cartoons
were just garish displays

437
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,689
of anti-Japanese hysteria,

438
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,683
and now he's the face of Warner Bros.

439
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,128
I'm not talking about Pipey, Jared.
I'm talking about Pied Piper.

440
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,930
We're dead. We fought Gavin Belson,
Russ, Hooli,

441
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,367
the lawsuit, that fucking Box,

442
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,966
all so we could build our platform
the way we wanted to.

443
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:53,649
And we did, but I guess
you just can't fight public opinion,

444
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:57,008
except for one woman named Bernice.

445
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,009
Face it, Jared, being too early
is the same as being wrong.

446
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,161
Hey-

447
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,251
- We'll figure it out.
- I don't know if we will.

448
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,730
Besides, I think I'm getting tired
of being kicked in the balls.

449
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,121
Come on, we have a few weeks of runway left.

450
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,043
Uh, I don't want to say exactly how much.

451
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,122
Again, I'm not comfortable estimating, but...

452
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,205
Take what's left of it
and divide it up amongst the guys.

453
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,090
I mean, it won't be anywhere close to
what you're owed in back pay,

454
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,571
but at least it's something.

455
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,928
Don't give up. Richard, come on, not yet.

456
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,923
We've got to hang on,
we've got to see what happens.

457
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,843
Something could turn around. I know it will.

458
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,488
- You really believe that?
- Absolutely.

459
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,531
Gilfoyle's right, you're a terrible liar.

460
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,005
Um, just set an all-hands
for tomorrow at 9:00 a.m.

461
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,082
And I'll tell the gang.

462
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,401
It's over, Jared.

463
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:02,207
And lastly, our deal
to furnish EndFrame boxes

464
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,124
to Maleant Data System Solutions
has officially closed,

465
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,046
putting us far ahead of
even the most optimistic profit targets

466
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,565
issued by this very board.

467
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,565
Gavin, it appears we owe you an apology.

468
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,570
We'd like to restore
your full status as CEO and chair

469
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,725
with a significantly revised bonus
and stock options package.

470
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,761
Thank you.

471
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,127
Of course, apology accepted.

472
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,124
I would like nothing more
than to move forward

473
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,487
in a harmonious and productive manner.

474
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,449
Actually, with that in mind,

475
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,887
there's something I'd like to show you.

476
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,964
It's outside. Is that all right?

477
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,730
A little field trip, if you will?

478
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,411
Just down here.

479
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,571
A little farther.

480
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,001
We're almost there.

481
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,401
Just out here, everyone. Almost there.

482
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,484
Consider the elephant.

483
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:07,006
Legend has it its memory
is so robust it never forgets.

484
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,082
And I assure you,
gentlemen of the Hooli board,

485
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:12,687
and lady, neither do I.

486
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,603
Okay, guys, uh,

487
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,368
we need to have a serious discussion
about the future of the company.

488
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,204
What? Why is everyone smiling?

489
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,009
Richard, something happened last night.

490
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,003
The daily active users are up, way up.

491
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,561
- Look at it. Look.
- Really?

492
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,641
Holy shit!

493
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,929
Did we just get 7,000 users in a day?

494
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,445
We sure did! We're back!

495
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,644
I don't know if it was the outreach

496
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,803
or the tutorials,
but we seem to be getting traction.

497
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,281
Richard, you pulled us out of a nosedive.

498
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:05,287
Of course, inevitably, we will run out of fuel
and plummet towards the Earth,

499
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,967
leaving only a crater behind
of torn flesh and excrement,

500
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,520
but in the meantime, we are flying high!

501
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,887
Yeah. I guess we are.

502
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,928
You know, it's crazy, just last night I was

503
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,731
telling Jared that I thought
we should shut down the company.

504
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,485
Well, perfect timing then, huh?

505
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,281
Oh.

506
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,885
Excuse me. I should get this.

507
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,681
Hey, Jared.

508
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,250
- Are those numbers legit?
- Of course.

509
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,685
- All right, then.
