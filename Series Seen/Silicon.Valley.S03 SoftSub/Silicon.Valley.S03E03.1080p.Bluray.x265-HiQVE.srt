1
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,491
Here it is.

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,645
This is your future.

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,447
One of your Pied Piper boxes
would go right here in this rack.

4
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,726
okay-

5
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,960
Okay.

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,321
Let me show you the next location
in which we would install one of your boxes.

7
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,243
Richard,
what the fuck are we doing here?

8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,129
I don't like it any more than you do.

9
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,204
I told Jack we'd come check this place out
and then we'd have a discussion.

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,204
I can't believe you suggested
the idea of building a fucking appliance.

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,327
I didn't, okay?

12
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,570
I pitched it as an example of what not to do
and the fucking sales guys ran with it.

13
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,880
I didn't want to go to enterprise.

14
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,166
You were the ones who said it would be fine.

15
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,044
- No, we didn't say that.
- You said it all the time.

16
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,610
That's not what we said. That is not...

17
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,366
Here it is. This is where another one
of your Pied Piper boxes would go.

18
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,881
Okay. Good.

19
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,925
Okay. Let me show you the next location
in which we would install...

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,445
Actually, you know what?

21
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,525
Sorry. No offense,
but once you see one space in a rack,

22
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,165
you've kind of seen them all.

23
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,928
That's what I used to think
until I saw them all.

24
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,247
Would you like to see your desks?

25
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,810
- Our desks?
- What?

26
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,442
This is where we would install
a Pied Piper engineer.

27
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,926
Sorry. Why, exactly,
would we need to be here?

28
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,287
Your sales representative promised
24-hour-a-day, on-site maintenance,

29
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,930
at least for the first year.

30
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:47,287
So, one of us would have to be down here
for a year?

31
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,846
Even at night?

32
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,529
There's really no difference between
day and night down here,

33
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,882
so it makes things easy.

34
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,442
Okay, well, we should probably
get going. Now.

35
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,204
- Almost right now.
- Yeah, right now even.

36
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,081
Okay. Uh, there are 16 stairwells.

37
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,850
Which one would you like to see first?

38
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,202
Uh, just whatever's as fast as possible.

39
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,560
Your favorite one.

40
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,721
Hmm.

41
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,561
Okay.

42
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,081
Oh!

43
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,648
You see these fucking mole people?

44
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,926
Hey, where did John go?

45
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,602
Oh, shit. Did he go in a room?

46
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,082
No. Uh, probably around here.

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,445
Hey. John?

48
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,929
- John?
- Oh, uh... John?

49
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,843
- John!
- Oh, shit.

50
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,287
John!

51
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,731
- Where is he?
- John!

52
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,211
John!

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,686
We can't take my algorithm
and put it in a box and bury it at Maleant.

54
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,127
- We just can't.
- I think this thing is dead.

55
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,849
Jack, look, I have no doubt

56
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,201
that your guys can sell a box

57
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,568
and an appliance may be
a good short-term play,

58
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,166
but in the long term, we need to be building

59
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,969
-our full-time platform.
- Gloria!

60
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,045
Could you call the fish guy
and see what kind of warranty

61
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,249
we have on these things?
I think one of them is dead.

62
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,765
Jack, please.

63
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,161
You said that when we got back from Maleant,
we would discuss this.

64
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,004
Okay, let's discuss it.

65
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,607
Take a look at the
Conjoined Triangles of Success.

66
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,490
Now, what do those two triangles
make together?

67
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,405
- A square?
- A box. They make a box.

68
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,723
- You can't make that shit up.
- But you literally did make it up.

69
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,084
Yes, I did.
And now they teach it at business schools.

70
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,562
But I was only referring to the serendipity
of the coincidence.

71
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,211
Look, if we build you the box,

72
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,807
will you promise to let us build the platform
when it's done?

73
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,760
We'll think about then then.

74
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,842
Now we need to worry about now.

75
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,049
Build me a box now.

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,081
How'd it go?

77
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,525
Uh, not well.

78
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,806
All right, then.

79
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,129
What do you... What do you mean?
What are you doing?

80
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,323
Well, first, I'm changing my Linkedln status

81
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,611
to "Looking for work."

82
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,484
That box is artless commerce.
I won't be a party to it.

83
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,449
So, you're just gonna quit?

84
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,409
Just like that? How can you do that?

85
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,840
By saying the words "I" and "quit"
in conjunction together, i.e., "I quit."

86
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,127
Well, there's actually
some paperwork involved.

87
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,168
Hey, can I have that USB missile launcher?

88
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,003
I'll just fish it out of the trash later.

89
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,606
Gilfoyle, come on.

90
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,207
Give me some time to figure a way out of this,
'cause if you quit now,

91
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,891
you're gonna lose all your shares.

92
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,407
And what if Barker changes his mind
and lets us build the platform?

93
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,806
And the odds of that are?

94
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,649
Already? Recruiters move fast these days.

95
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,886
This is Gilfoyle. Dazzle me.

96
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,009
More recruiter swag?

97
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,606
You got an Oculus?

98
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,489
- Yup.
- That's a hoverboard?

99
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,250
How many meetings are you taking?

100
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,289
None. That's the irony.

101
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,569
The more meetings I turn down,
the more these recruiters send me.

102
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,521
- What are you doing?
- Eating popcorn.

103
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,171
- That's my popcorn.
- You have seven tubs of it.

104
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,083
You could be the mayor of Popcornopolis.

105
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,171
Don't eat the caramel.
You can have the cheese or the plain.

106
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,931
- You're leaving me with the cheddar?
- That's right. Dick.

107
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,044
Hey, can I borrow this? Just for a little bit?

108
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,128
No. Whoa, whoa, hold on.

109
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,525
You're wearing a gold chain?

110
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,689
Oh, right. Yeah, I've had it for a while.

111
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,205
Just kind of throw it on every now and then.

112
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,651
None of that is true.

113
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,202
- I definitely would've noticed.
- Okay, listen.

114
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,681
I've been working hard.
I'm making money for the first time.

115
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,327
I was like...
Buy myself something nice, you know?

116
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,929
But instead of that, you bought a chain?

117
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,801
You're just jealous I have a salary, quitter.

118
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,965
And you are too legit to quit, eh, MC Hamas?

119
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,766
- Fuck off.
- Later, Chain the Virgin.

120
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,041
Well, Gilfoyle, looks like your recruiters

121
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,407
are gonna have to take back their gift baskets,

122
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,482
because I just got off the phone with Monica

123
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,608
and she's getting me in
to see Laurie this morning

124
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,126
so I can tell her what's going on.

125
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,208
But you're going over your CEO's head?

126
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,089
That is a serious breach of protocol.

127
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,128
I mean, if Jack finds out, he'll be furious.

128
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,804
Hey, when you push a man so far,

129
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,321
he goes out and buys a gun
and shoots everyone in a bank.

130
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,567
Whoa.

131
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,881
No, l wouldn’t, l wouldn’t.
I'm not... I'm not going to.

132
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,407
Just... The point is,
what other option do I have, anyway?

133
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,688
What other option do you have, Richard?

134
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,524
Can I speak with you alone, please?

135
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,967
Hmm?

136
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,808
Are you angry with me, Richard?

137
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,609
Have I done something to offend you?

138
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,843
No. What are you talking about?

139
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,288
You know, when you and the boys picked up
and went to the new offices,

140
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,850
and didn't invite me along,

141
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,440
- I didn't say anything.
- Yeah, because you don't work at Pied Piper.

142
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,888
And you haven't let me forget that
for even one moment, have you, Richard?

143
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,684
I'm having trouble tracking this.

144
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,569
I don't know what you're mad about.

145
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,371
You publicly proclaimed,
"I have to go over Barker's head

146
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,125
"because what other option do I have?"

147
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,922
What other option do you have, Richard?

148
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,451
- Uh...
-'Cause there is another option,

149
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,568
and he's standing here,
looking you in the face,

150
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,529
and you're staring back
like he don't even exist.

151
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,327
Just to be as clear as I possibly can be here,

152
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,922
are you trying to tell me
that you want to talk to Barker?

153
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,731
No, Richard, I don't want to talk to Barker.

154
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,404
- I want you to want me to talk to Barker.
- You know,

155
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,645
at this point, if it'll make you feel better,
sure, you can go talk to Barker.

156
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,647
See? Was that so hard?

157
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,722
Actually, yes, that was painfully difficult.

158
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,563
Yeah, she's definitely dead.

159
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,968
I'm sorry for your loss. Gloria!

160
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,527
Gloria!

161
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,731
Would you, uh, take this daughter of Neptune
back from whence she came?

162
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,207
The toilet, dear. That's okay.

163
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,686
What can I do for you, Mr. Bachman?

164
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,444
Ah, yes, to the matter at hand.

165
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,441
I spoke with Richard about the box project,

166
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,808
and, well, here are some of my thoughts
in no particular order.

167
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,521
- Why a box?
- What information do I not already have?

168
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,921
I'm sorry?

169
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,691
I said, "What information
do I not already have?"

170
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,529
I already have a five-year run rate
plus a full market forecast for my appliance.

171
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,807
I have the same for Richard's platform.

172
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,770
I've heard all of his
engineering team's complaints.

173
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,683
So, before you waste time

174
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,969
with some freeform jazz odyssey
of masturbatory bullshit,

175
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,960
just tell me what concrete information
you have for me

176
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,447
that I do not already possess!

177
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,766
Richard.

178
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,603
The way I see it,
you've got about two options.

179
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,488
One, you build yourself the box.

180
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,651
Two, you get Laurie Bream
on the phone ASAP.

181
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,523
All right, I'll see you back at the house.

182
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,324
Uh, okay.

183
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,604
Uh, Hiroki-san.

184
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,048
Um, what is that one?

185
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,811
It is a question mark made of human hair,

186
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,645
harvested, apparently,
from dead people in India.

187
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:54,529
It's a pun. it signifies that at Raviga,
we ask the big, hairy questions.

188
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,007
Right. Speaking of questions,

189
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,930
what should we do about Jack?

190
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,650
Well, I concur with your assessment

191
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,803
that a backup appliance
for data centers seems

192
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,247
an uninspired application of your technology.

193
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,006
I will contact him and we'll have
a frank discussion about this.

194
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,084
Great. I really appreciate
you hearing me out on this.

195
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,523
And it goes without saying, I was never here.

196
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,001
Oh.

197
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,561
What?

198
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,291
You are here. Now.

199
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,171
What Richard means is he would prefer

200
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,722
if you didn't tell Jack
that he came here to talk to you about this.

201
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:34,089
Yes, because the other interpretation
makes no sense.

202
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,569
Jack, Laurie Bream on line one.

203
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,889
Guys. Guys, it's happening. It's happening.

204
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,086
Hello.

205
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,891
Okay. Drop the hammer, Laurie Bream.

206
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,888
What are you doing?
He's going to see you looking.

207
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,724
I can't see 'cause of these fucking monitors.

208
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,968
- Whose fucking fault is that, okay?
-It's not my fucking fault.

209
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,371
Something's happening.

210
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,126
What?

211
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,448
What's happening? What's happening?

212
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,170
Oh, man. Barker's pissed.

213
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,685
How pissed? Scale of one to 10.

214
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,723
- Like, a seven.
- Fuck.

215
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,167
No,no,no,no,no.
Like, a nine, nine and a half.

216
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,765
Fuck! I'm missing everything.

217
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,921
I'm going to go to the kitchen.

218
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,161
He doesn't know. I could be hungry.

219
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,401
It's over. It's over.

220
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,128
I missed the whole fucking thing
because of these fucking monitors.

221
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,289
Richard? Jack would like
to see you in his office.

222
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,006
Oh, okay.

223
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,051
If you'll excuse me, gentlemen,

224
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,567
I'm gonna go ask Action Jack
how Laurie's dick tastes.

225
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,731
- Don't... No.
- Yeah.

226
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,730
You wanted to see me, chief?

227
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,202
Sure, come on in, Richard. Grab a seat.

228
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,801
Sure.

229
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,561
Oh.

230
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,605
Yeah. Okay.

231
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,889
So, guess who I just got off the phone with.

232
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,084
Uh. I have no idea. Who?

233
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,770
- Laurie Bream.
- Laurie Bream. From Raviga?

234
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,728
Exactly. She was pretty adamant

235
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,168
that the whole box project
here at Pied Piper was

236
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,964
woefully misguided.

237
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,771
Whoa, strong words. Wow.

238
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:15,004
In fact, it was her opinion that we should
immediately abandon the box

239
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,482
in favor of the consumer platform
version of Pied Piper

240
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,922
which I believe you and your guys
were bucking for.

241
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,926
I don't know about "bucking,"

242
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,287
but, yeah. Yeah, well, hey, look,

243
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,803
- Laurie Bream is the investor.
- Yeah.

244
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,491
She is the investor.

245
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,202
Anyway, she wanted a comprehensive,
go-to-market strategy

246
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,170
for the platform version within 48 hours.

247
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,045
Wow. Well, what Laurie wants, Laurie gets.

248
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,122
So, yeah.
We should probably get started on that.

249
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,440
No, we shouldn't, Richard.

250
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,129
We're not building the platform.

251
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,565
We're building a box.

252
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,246
Okay, but...

253
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,130
Didn't Laurie say that
she wanted the platform?

254
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,124
Yes, she said that, and then I said

255
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,886
that if Pied Piper was going
to build a platform,

256
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,530
she would have to fire me.

257
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,330
What did she say?

258
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,450
She said she was not interested
in doing that at this time.

259
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,124
And did she say anything after that?

260
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,804
We're building the box, Richard.

261
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,965
Twelve weeks from today, we're going to
present her a prototype of that box.

262
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,649
So, let's get it done.

263
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,686
Okay.

264
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,447
Yup.

265
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,204
One more thing, Richard.

266
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,684
If you're going to shoot the king,

267
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,562
you better be goddamn sure you kill him.

268
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,930
You understand what that means?

269
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,485
Yeah-a r.

270
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,922
Did you just say "Yar"?

271
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,601
No.

272
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,727
Look at us.
Two rogues on the King's Highway.

273
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,688
Let the rats run in their maze.

274
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,240
We chose this. This is our destiny.

275
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,930
Freedom. Isn't that right, Gilfoyle?

276
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,687
- Did you say something?
- Of course.

277
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,886
If it's more popcorn,
tell them we're at capacity.

278
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,883
<i>It's</i> a guy <i>from Men in Black.</i>

279
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,050
- Bertram Gilfoyle?
- Yeah.

280
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,690
I'm here on behalf of Twen-X recruiting,

281
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,809
- I'm supposed to give you this.
- Pappy Van Winkle.

282
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,609
Now we're talking. I'll take it.

283
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,441
They told me not to give it to you
until after the meeting.

284
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,644
I respect your skills.

285
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,131
Let me get my jacket.

286
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,048
She was supposed to talk Barker
out of making the box.

287
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,246
What the fuck happened?

288
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,765
- Richard.
- What?

289
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,690
I was on the call, okay? She tried, he said no.

290
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,604
- Well, then she should fire him.
- She can't fire him.

291
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,091
Why not? She fired me.

292
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,084
Exactly. She can't fire him
because she fired you.

293
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,329
Firing a young CEO
and installing a much more experienced one

294
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,561
looks like leadership.

295
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,530
Firing two CEOs in a month looks like chaos.

296
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,686
Richard, look, I'm sorry,
but I think the box is here to stay.

297
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,611
Okay? Laurie's gonna have to pretend to be
in favor of it.

298
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,444
She'll probably issue press releases

299
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,411
talking about how it's the best application
of your visionary technology.

300
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,206
Is there nothing that we can say to Laurie
to change her mind?

301
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,125
If I could control Laurie,

302
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,370
do you really think I'd be looking
out my office door at that monstrosity?

303
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,128
Jeez, Monica, he's not that bad.

304
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,123
I mean, he's a little ugly, I guess.

305
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,168
Oh, the question mark. Sorry.

306
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,846
Mr. Gilfoyle. We're ready for you.

307
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,728
The guys cannot wait to see you again.

308
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,201
Again?

309
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,844
- Gilfoyle.
- What the fuck?

310
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,241
Good to see you again, buddy.
Why don't you have a seat?

311
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,765
You stole half of our algorithm.

312
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,525
You think you can bring me in here
and pay me to give you the rest?

313
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,566
No. We want you
because you're a full-stack engineer.

314
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,331
We already paid someone else
for the missing piece of Middle-Out.

315
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,643
- Bullshit.
- Do you know Naveen and Eric,

316
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,405
who, until very recently,
headed up engineering at Nucleus?

317
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,561
- Hey, man.
- What's up?

318
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,402
- Nope.
- Well, I'm sure you at least recognize

319
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,970
the code they brought us.

320
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,651
That's exactly how they had it.

321
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:37,086
Okay. So, EndFrame has
our entire prediction loop,

322
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,282
down to the last fucking semicolon.

323
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,524
So, Nucleus stole half our IP,
and EndFrame stole the other half.

324
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,324
And now they've knitted them together.

325
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,240
So, while we are busy building Barker's box,

326
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,567
EndFrame is beating us to market
with a platform.

327
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,441
So, basically, we are a fucking
mediocre appliance company.

328
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,285
At least we'll make a little money doing it.

329
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,001
Oh, great.

330
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,521
So, you can go back to the car wash
and buy some more chains,

331
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,603
huh, Pakistani Mr. T?

332
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,206
Fuck you.

333
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,807
Wait. Are you not wearing it?

334
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,644
You're not. Did you take it off
because I was fucking with you?

335
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,691
- No. it was itchy on my neck, so...
- Bullshit.

336
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,326
That was a bad decision.

337
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,643
You flinched. Now the pain will never end.

338
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,606
I'm sorry to say it, but Gilfoyle's right.

339
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,331
You're making it worse. Sorry, Django.

340
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,330
Django?

341
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,527
Unchained.

342
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,491
Great. Now even fucking Jared
is busting my balls.

343
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,923
I am. I'm... I'm busting your balls.

344
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,243
You know what? If you're gonna give me shit
for it anyway, I'm just going to wear it.

345
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,322
Okay, Jared.
Congratulations, by the way,

346
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,324
but we have our own balls
to worry about, all right?

347
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,369
Uh, look, how are we going
to save the platform?

348
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,843
What choice do we have? Barker is the CEO.

349
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,684
We have to do what he says.

350
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,161
Or do we?

351
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,482
I don't know.
I don't want to lie down for this, okay?

352
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,483
I don't want to just give up so easily.

353
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:04,441
Richard, unfortunately, in this case,
I think we have to roll over and take it.

354
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,801
Or do we?

355
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,324
- Erlich, you have something to say?
- Richard,

356
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,322
when George Washington
founded a little startup

357
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,882
we've come to know as these
United States of America,

358
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,851
and he was tired of getting shit
from his CEO, the King of England,

359
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,282
did he just roll over and take it from behind?

360
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,490
No. He called on his ride-or-die homeboys,

361
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,367
Tommy Jefferson, Benny Franklin,

362
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,251
and Alex Hamilton,
who was half-black, so that's Dinesh.

363
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,761
I'm not half-black.

364
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,730
He said, "Avast, ye fellow badasses,

365
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,370
"let's build this country
the way we motherfucking want to."

366
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,008
And so, Richard,
if we want to build the platform,

367
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,526
all we need to do is

368
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,126
build the platform.

369
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,210
That was underwhelming.

370
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,846
Perhaps you can go into slightly more detail?

371
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,844
We tell Barker exactly what he wants to hear.

372
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,844
That way, he thinks
we're being good little boys.

373
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,969
But what we're actually doing

374
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,889
is building the platform. Think about it.

375
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,645
What's he gonna do?

376
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,560
- Call the cops.
- Actually, no.

377
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,090
Uh, Erlich may be onto something.

378
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,288
If all we gave him was the platform,

379
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,482
Jack would have no other option

380
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,484
than to embrace it
and then say it was his idea all along,

381
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,530
because at that point,
he can't tell Laurie the truth.

382
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,841
What? That he had absolutely no idea

383
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,048
what was going on
inside of his own company?

384
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,690
He'd look like an idiot.

385
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,446
And Laurie wants the platform, anyway,

386
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,770
so she'd be good for it.

387
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,726
Okay.

388
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,484
We build a skunkworks.

389
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,366
A secret company inside the company.

390
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,364
We go all Ocean's Eleven on his ass.

391
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,010
<i>Hold on. Ocean's Eleven?</i>

392
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,000
It's a 2001 casino heist film,
starring Julia Roberts and 11 men.

393
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,844
I know what it is, Jared.

394
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,049
I'm saying, not only are we going
to have to engineer,

395
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,885
code, and stand up
a full platform on our own,

396
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,883
we also have to make Jack
and his sales weasels think

397
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,962
we're working on the box the entire time.

398
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,720
And if we fuck anything up and get caught,

399
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,850
he could take our stock
and probably have us arrested.

400
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,322
- All right, I'm in.
- Well, you're insane.

401
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,484
No, Dinesh, that chain is insane.

402
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,686
And not in the membrane.

403
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,683
Sorry, Cypress Halal.

404
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,365
Okay, Jared, settle down.

405
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,528
But this? This is fucking genius.

406
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,968
Okay, how do we even begin to pull it off?

407
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,083
Okay. Well, let's work through it.

408
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,641
I can generate fake status reports,
purchase orders, deliverables updates,

409
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,606
and I can liaise with sales to coordinate what
custom features we need to pretend to build.

410
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,801
Okay, great, yeah,

411
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,928
but faking the box is
going to be the easy part.

412
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,287
Building the platform is the real challenge.

413
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,169
Gilfoyle, where are we on the server space?

414
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,685
That's gonna be tricky.

415
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,003
When we started moving out of the house,
I dismantled Anton.

416
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,807
All the racks, GPUs,
and cables are in storage at the office.

417
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,605
- We're gonna have to break him out.
- That's a shit-ton of hardware.

418
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,570
Unless we do it one piece at a time,

419
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,849
like <i>Shawshank Redemption
or The Great Escape, you know?</i>

420
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,763
I'd have bigger clothing on the day, but...

421
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,205
- Wait.
- Wait.

422
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,766
I've got a better idea.

423
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,722
Let's say these LEGOs are Anton,

424
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,600
sad stacks of server components
lying dormant in storage.

425
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,371
Sneaking all of him out would be too difficult.

426
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:28,923
So, if we can't break Anton out,
maybe we can break in.

427
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,281
Stand the servers up right where they are.

428
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,725
- Can we do that?
- Easy.

429
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,731
I can run cable through
the drop panel in the ceiling

430
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,081
all the way to the building's
main power panel.

431
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,645
When I pull a little bit of power

432
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,961
from each of the other tenants,
no one will know.

433
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,486
Guys, I hate to keep
shitting on your campfire,

434
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,244
but servers are not the real issue.

435
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,522
We have a manpower problem.

436
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,968
There's a ton of engineering
to be done on the platform.

437
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,243
Yeah, he's right, but we have to pay them
under the table.

438
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,721
I know just the right man for the job.

439
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,924
You guys are fucking nuts, but I dig it.

440
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,086
Here's the deal. I'm going to need
the back pay you guys owe me

441
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,400
for when I was working for free,

442
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,403
not to mention lost wages from my old job.

443
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,251
Oh, and damages from when
Jared sexually harassed me

444
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,810
into being friends with that Monica chick.

445
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,647
So, all that and you're in?

446
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,129
In? No.

447
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,204
That's just to keep me from telling Barker
about your secret project.

448
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,724
What? Are you serious?

449
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,040
Oh, yeah.

450
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,931
Well, there goes most of our cash.

451
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,401
We just got extorted for $20,000.

452
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,528
Fuck Carla. She was dead weight, anyway.

453
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,046
- What's next?
- I just thought of something.

454
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,646
It's a big problem,
but I think I've got a solution.

455
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,607
Hello, this is Bertram Gilfoyle.

456
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,491
Yes, I'm still available,

457
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,769
and I would reconsider sitting down with you
and your clients

458
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:53,402
if you send four large pizzas
to 5230 Newell Road

459
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,005
in 30 minutes or less.

460
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,206
Okay. I think that covers it.

461
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,521
We've thought of everything. We have a plan.

462
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,845
- Everybody in?
- In.

463
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,805
- In.
- Fuck yes, I'm in.

464
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,362
And I'm into the idea of taking
a bigger leadership role in the company.

465
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,925
We're not gonna make the same mistakes...

466
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,764
Okay, Erlich, just... Just say, "In."

467
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,491
- We're all just saying, "In."
- I'm in-volved.

468
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,528
Hey, you can't spell
"involved" without an "in."

469
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,170
Just be in. Uh, Dinesh?

470
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,761
All right, fuck it, I'm in. But on one condition.

471
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,205
I'm going to need everyone to solemnly swear

472
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,886
that they will no longer
make fun of my gold chain.

473
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,284
Not a word ever again.

474
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,727
Well, guys, I think we can agree to that.

475
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,925
This plan better fucking work
with a sacrifice like this.

476
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,971
Shall we drink from the teat
of Pappy to celebrate?

477
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,721
I think I might actually
enjoy going to work now.

478
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,566
Wait.

479
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,683
We can't enjoy going to work.

480
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,564
Meinertzhagen's Haversack.

481
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,647
- What?
- Meinertzhagen's Haversack.

482
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,686
No one? Really?

483
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,969
No one's heard
of Meinertzhagen's Haversack?

484
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:37,123
Of course I have, Jared.
Just explain it to them.

485
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,602
Well, it's a principle of military deception.

486
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:44,241
Essentially, it means
you have to continue to act the part.

487
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:48,246
So, as far as anyone knows,
we're still building a box that we hate.

488
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,887
- We need to act like it.
- That's exactly right.

489
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,570
If we do anything differently,
Barker's going to be onto us.

490
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,842
We have to keep complaining about Barker.

491
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,968
We have to keep bitching about the box.

492
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,805
We have to keep making fun
of your gold chain.

493
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,641
We have to.
We don't have any other choice, Dinesh.

494
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,724
- He's right.
-It's a shame, Bell Biv Dinesh,

495
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,725
but unfortunately, that chain is poison.

496
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,048
All right. To skunkworks!

497
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,488
Hey, all right. I don't usually drink
at 7:30 in the morning, but...

498
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,601
All right.

499
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:29,046
Hey, guys, um, look,
we have to shred everything in this house

500
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,130
that pertains to skunkworks.
If anyone catches wind

501
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,766
of anything that we've done here,
we are fucked.

502
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,723
Okay, you guys, this is it.

503
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,290
No turning back now.

504
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,691
Dinesh, I have a few premium chain insults

505
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,286
that I'm going to lay on you
when we get in there.

506
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,411
Not for myself, obviously, but for the team.

507
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,960
I might just have one, too. Sorry in advance.

508
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,326
Yeah. Great.

509
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,524
Have at it, assholes.

00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,406
Hey, Dinesh, nice chain.

511
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,966
Do you choke your mother with it
when you put your penis in her butthole?

512
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,929
What the fuck? Oh, shit!

513
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,286
- Whoa, Richard.
- Here, I've got it.

514
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,410
No, no, no, that's private. Excuse me.

515
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,207
- Skunkworks?
- Private information.

516
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,570
Uh, Keith, where are you going?

517
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,689
Richard, why did you bring
all the skunkwork docs into the office?

518
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,763
You were supposed to shred those.

519
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,450
Yes, but I was gonna shred them here,

520
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,682
because we don't have a shredder
at the house, do we?

521
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,927
Guys?

522
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,050
My office. Now.
