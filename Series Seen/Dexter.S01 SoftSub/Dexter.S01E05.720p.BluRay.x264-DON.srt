1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,920
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,670
Think this is our guy's work?

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,090
The ice-truck killer?

4
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:08,670
LaGuerta insulted the real
killer's intelligence,

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,670
and now he's getting back at us
for chasing after the wrong guy.

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,840
It's the guard - Tucci. I think he's alive.

7
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:16,340
Tucci's alive?

8
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,600
The ice-truck killer is keeping him alive
to perform amputations.

9
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,310
He's sending me a message.

10
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,640
He wants me to go there.

11
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:27,810
Please.

12
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,690
- He was left here so I would kill him.
- Just kill me.

13
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,400
I can't kill this man.

14
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,370
They're taking Tucci over to County alive.

15
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:40,870
I don't know who your contacts are, Morgan,
but you are my up-and-comer.

16
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:42,700
You saved a man's life tonight.

17
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:47,710
The thing that surprises me most about Rita
is how much I like being with her.

18
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,500
There's all sorts of things I can do.

19
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,390
What... What are you doing?

20
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,060
Whatever I want.

21
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,440
My new friend thought I wouldn't be able
to resist the kill he left for me...

22
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,150
but I did.

23
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:16,150
I'm not the monster he wants me to be.

24
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,280
I'm Dexter.

25
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,940
I like to pretend I'm alone.

26
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:21,320
Completely alone,

27
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,870
maybe post-apocalypse or plague,

28
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:29,540
whatever. No one left to act normal for,

29
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,000
no need to hide who I really am.

30
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:36,340
It would be freeing.

31
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,010
Stop grinning like a fucking psycho
and get back to work.

32
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:41,630
Sorry, Sergeant.

33
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,640
I was just waiting for Forensics to wrap up
before I tear the bed apart.

34
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,560
I'm not the only one who enjoys isolation.

35
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,310
My shadow companion
chose this place well.

36
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,740
This was his sanctuary,

37
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,570
for a while, at least.

38
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,700
All these people pawing over it, it seems...

39
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,200
disrespectful.

40
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,840
Tell me the sick bastard
bled on something, Dexter.

41
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,840
He was here for days,
playing with sharp objects.

42
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,510
I'll keep looking, but so far
this place is spotless, amazingly so.

43
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,180
The only blood I found
belongs to the security guard.

44
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,060
- Has he said anything yet?
- Mr. Tucci's still unconscious.

45
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,600
Lieutenant, up here!

46
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,600
There's got to be something here. Find it.

47
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,270
The guy's not a ghost.
Tony Tucci is evidence of that.

48
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,190
Hey, Dexter, you get
all this blood on camera yet?

49
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,570
It's like shooting a Jackson Pollock.

50
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,910
Well, your Jackson Pollock is in the bag.

51
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,460
Ready?

52
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,920
OK.

53
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,590
What was that? Did you see that?

54
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:05,130
- What?
- Damn rats.

55
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,930
We're all gonna get histoplasmosis
from all their shit in the dust.

56
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:14,270
We'll be coughing up blood,
skin lesions, mouth sores.

57
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,890
Lovely.
Can we get the lights, guys?

58
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,320
You ever hear of rat-bite fever?

59
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,070
Masuka, what did I say
about the fucking rats?

60
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,420
You haven't found anything,
won't find anything. This is a bust, right?

61
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,800
In so many words.

62
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,510
Which means I'm just jerking off
till Tucci wakes up.

63
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:50,090
So take a break.
You've been working this thing 24-7.

64
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,350
- Or are you still avoiding a personal life?
- Oh, fuck you.

65
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,850
And, yeah, I'm better off
just focusing on the job.

66
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,640
Thanks, guys.

67
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,020
It doesn't have to be either/or.

68
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,360
Maybe not for you.

69
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,860
If I found someone, so can you, right?

70
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,150
Yeah, the trouble is keeping them.

71
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,490
Tell me about it.

72
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,510
Yelina?

73
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:35,970
Are you OK?

74
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,100
I'm sorry. I'm fine.

75
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,230
Ernesto hasn't arrived?

76
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,240
I'm sure he'll be here soon.

77
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,910
No.

78
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,750
The coyote wanted more money,
and I didn't have it.

79
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,870
Coyote?

80
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,670
You mean the man you paid
to bring him here?

81
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:08,420
He said he sent Ernesto back to Cuba.

82
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:09,590
But that was a week ago,

83
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,090
and no one in Cárdenas
has heard from Ernesto.

84
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:15,640
Yelina, how did you contact this coyote?

85
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,360
This was his number
but it's not working anymore.

86
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:27,110
I was supposed to leave him
money in a park.

87
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:30,150
Listen, my boyfriend works for the police.
I'm sure he...

88
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,610
No, no, no.
We can't go to the police.

89
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,070
He said he'd hurt my family in Cuba
if we go to the police.

90
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,410
It's OK. It's OK.

91
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,370
Dexter will know what to do.

92
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,130
I feel just terrible for her.

93
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,090
And they were supposed to be married
after he got here.

94
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,550
I do know someone in the department
who deals with immigration issues.

95
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,850
I can talk to him.

96
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,970
That's really kind of you, Dex.

97
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:05,770
I mean, can you imagine not
knowing if your fiancé is dead or alive?

98
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,730
No.

99
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,360
Every night after work Yelina goes across the
street, to the beach.

100
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,280
I've seen her there,
just staring out at the water,

101
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:18,740
willing him to walk out of it.

102
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:25,040
Have you ever longed
for anything like that?

103
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,170
She wants something from me.

104
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,500
Ever since the blow job,

105
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,340
she assumes we've taken it
to the next level.

106
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:36,390
She doesn't know yet -
I don't have a next level.

107
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:40,640
Well, when I was a kid,
I would have killed for an Atari.

108
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:42,560
You know?

109
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,850
Cody would laugh at the graphics now,
but back then, man...

110
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,860
It always comes to this
once sex is introduced.

111
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,700
Small talk no longer cuts it.

112
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:59,660
Eventually she'll call me a science project
and slam the door in my face.

113
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:03,160
But when do you think he'll wake up?

114
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,870
Yeah, I did call an hour ago,
but there's a killer out there

115
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,830
that's into whores and security guards,

116
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,420
but I'll bet nurses are next.

117
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:15,170
Yo, check you, all "MMPD Blue."

118
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:19,350
Shanda, what are you doing here? You have
another lead on the ice-truck killer?

119
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,560
Man, I got bigger worries
than that sick shit.

120
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,390
Now I got me a girl on the inside, right?

121
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,890
I'm not springing your pimp,
if that's what you're after.

122
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,560
Hell, no.
But my landlord's another fucking story,

123
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,980
trying to kick me out of my home.

124
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:35,610
He got no cause, except he's a born-again
hypocrite motherfucker.

125
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,240
And you want me to talk to him?

126
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,660
No, I want you to beat in
his pasty, white face.

127
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,250
Found this in evidence.

128
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:46,370
Masuka was gonna grease it through.

129
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,670
A cigarette butt?

130
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:51,210
Jesus, we could pull DNA
off of that, or even a print.

131
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,670
Except it would be your print.

132
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,760
You were smoking on a crime scene.

133
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,050
Not on a crime scene,
like on the way-far end of the park.

134
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:02,850
The whole area's a crime scene.
You should know that by now.

135
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,060
Maybe you ought to just calm
the hell down, my brother.

136
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:10,400
- Who the fuck is that?
- Give it a rest, Shanda.

137
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,190
Morgan, go do something useful.

138
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,650
Go sit on that security guard
until he wakes up.

139
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,440
And do not talk to him without me.

140
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,700
Believe me, your maid is not the first one
to get screwed.

141
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,660
No, she's a maid. She's not my maid.

142
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,790
So, have you heard of any other
Cuban immigrants disappearing?

143
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,380
A few. The poor bastards.

144
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,210
They spend their life savings,
get stuffed into a fishhold,

145
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,090
puke the whole 90 miles to Miami.

146
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,800
Then they get here, thinking,
"I'm an American. I'm free."

147
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:43,930
Except the damn coyote...

148
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:50,640
he won't let him go till his family comes up
with a surprise release fee.

149
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,400
If they can't pay...

150
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,480
They disappear.

151
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:59,950
Freedom's just another word
for one more way to get fucked.

152
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,870
Sounds like someone's
doing something very bad.

153
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,660
You have any suspects?

154
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:14,000
Sure, four or five.
Mostly Cubans themselves,

155
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:17,840
but not enough evidence for a conviction
or even a warrant.

156
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,890
If warrants were applied for,
their names will be in the database.

157
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:26,430
Look, buddy...

158
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,190
I know you want to help out your maid,
but there ain't a hell of a lot you can do.

159
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,940
You'd be surprised.

160
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,130
Jorge Castillo.

161
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,510
Number three on the department's
list of suspects,

162
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,930
but the only one even
remotely close to the park

163
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:05,720
where Yelina was supposed
to drop the money.

164
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,970
They never got enough evidence
for a search warrant,

165
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,190
but I don't need permission
to keep an eye on this guy.

166
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,370
No neighbors, no foot traffic...

167
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,620
It's promising.

168
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,250
A good place for human trafficking...

169
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,710
or worse.

170
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,220
Excuse me.

171
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,930
Private yard.

172
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:56,350
I'm just praying you have a '69 Stingray
headlight somewhere in here.

173
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,650
Dave Cutler.

174
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,610
Jorge Castillo.

175
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,190
I'm sorry, but I don't.

176
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,780
Man, my restoration's almost done.
She's a beauty.

177
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,700
I don't do individual sales, Mr. Cutler,

178
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,700
but I can give you the name
of a Corvette shop that I deal with.

179
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,120
I'll be happy to look around myself.

180
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,870
No offense, man,
but I can't take my phone orders

181
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,920
if I'm watching over my merchandise.

182
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,590
You run this whole place alone?

183
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,170
Yeah, it keeps my costs down.

184
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,170
I'm sorry you made the trip out here.

185
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,130
You know what?

186
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,260
Try Wexler's, out in Tamarac.

187
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,850
That's my Vette guy.

188
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,430
Must be nice being your own boss.

189
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,440
Get out in the water whenever you want.

190
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,310
I saw that floater on your key chain.
I got to get one of those.

191
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,150
Lost my keys overboard
twice in the past year.

192
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,030
I do a little fishing.
I got a 32-foot Concept.

193
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,530
What about you?

194
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,910
I got a rowboat with a hole in it.

195
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:58,210
I don't speak Spanish, sir.

196
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,000
Sorry. I just assumed you were Cuban.

197
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,380
American, pal, just like you.

198
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,260
Just like me.

199
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,860
He's on heavy sedatives at the moment.

200
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:32,570
I think he deserves them.

201
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,410
I'll wait.

202
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,180
Mr. Tucci.

203
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,320
Tony.

204
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,320
I'm gonna find this cocksucker.

205
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,040
I swear.

206
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:26,150
I don't understand
America's obsession with cars.

207
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,740
I can just imagine squeezing
Rita and the kids into this thing,

208
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,990
hitting the open road -
cramped quarters, public bathrooms,

209
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:37,820
hours of nothing but conversation.

210
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,830
It's someone's American Dream -
my nightmare.

211
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,990
This must be where Castillo locks them up.

212
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:18,620
But if he's killing them when they can't pay,
he's not doing it here.

213
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,410
So where are they?

214
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,560
Dexter Morgan.

215
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,560
Gerard here. There's a floater
down in South Beach morgue.

216
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:51,770
Could be a match for your maid's fiancé.

217
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,780
She's a maid. She's not my...

218
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:58,530
- Is it all right if I bring her down?
- The sooner, the better.

219
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,370
OK, then. Thanks. Have a good day.

220
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,740
Tonight at the salsa room.

221
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:06,290
You got to help me
celebrate my pay-grade bump.

222
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:12,000
Actually, I have a personal project
I'm working on tonight.

223
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:14,250
Blow it off. I'm buying.

224
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,340
Do you have that list
of prioritized witnesses?

225
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,550
I can't deal with 800 anonymous tips.

226
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,050
I'm working on it.

227
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:23,600
Well, how about you stop talking
and earn your bump?

228
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,430
Sexy.

229
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,900
Don't leave me hanging tonight, bro.
It's you and me.

230
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:33,900
I wonder what I did to make him
think we're so close.

231
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,740
I wonder if it'd work on Rita.

232
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:44,530
Dexter Morgan. I called earlier.

233
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:48,120
Oh, right, yeah, about the floater.

234
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,960
Yeah.

235
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,580
Jerry, can you take
these guys around back?

236
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,250
Should I?

237
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,760
No, I'll go with her.

238
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,090
She might need a shoulder.

239
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,010
She senses I'm not a shoulder.

240
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,390
Bad sign - she's catching on.

241
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,980
I don't know what kind of idiot
thinks an inner tube

242
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,520
is gonna get him
over 90 miles of open ocean.

243
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,780
If you ask me, man,
it's Darwin's theory at work.

244
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,580
That must be what love looks like.

245
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:40,630
The inability to feel
has its advantages...

246
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,970
sometimes.

247
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:55,110
- Hey, Dexter.
- Hey, Mindy.

248
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,520
Do you need any help?

249
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:58,480
No.

250
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:01,490
So, are you gonna go
to the spring formal?

251
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,530
Why would I want to do that?

252
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:17,210
She wanted you to ask her
to the dance, Dexter.

253
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,460
That's not what she said.

254
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:22,170
You have to learn their signals.

255
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:25,840
Yeah, well, I don't really care about girls.

256
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:30,140
I just like being alone.

257
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:38,980
But most normal people don't,
and it's important that you seem normal.

258
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:41,940
- Even though I'm not.
- Because you're not.

259
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:50,330
We'll start you off with a temporary prefab

260
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,580
and then make adjustments as we go.

261
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:57,130
Rudy here's gonna put me
back together again, good as new.

262
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:02,130
Half the battle is attitude,
and you have a great one.

263
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,010
Well, I'm alive.

264
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:08,220
I didn't see that happening, but here I am.

265
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:16,440
Yo, pretty boy, you're stealing my thunder,

266
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,480
and I got a hottie waiting on me, so...

267
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,280
I don't know.

268
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,400
I just might have to fight you for this one.

269
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,360
OK, we'll arm-wrestle later.

270
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:28,990
Now get out of here.

271
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:32,330
Watch out for this guy. He's a dog.

272
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,120
Excuse me.

273
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:46,590
I know what you need, guys,
but I didn't see much.

274
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:49,430
Any detail will help, Mr. Tucci.

275
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,470
Well...

276
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,560
He came up on me from behind,

277
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,940
and he wore a mask
when he made me put the...

278
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,780
things on the ice.

279
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:06,990
I'll get it.

280
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,160
Angel of mercy.

281
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,990
Just how merciful are you?

282
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,780
Oh, you are a dog, aren't you?

283
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:14,490
So the ladies tell me.

284
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:18,580
Can you tell us how tall he was
or if he was black, white, Latino?

285
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:25,340
White, I think.
I'm guessing maybe average height.

286
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:28,550
Not fat, not thin, just average.

287
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,850
I don't know.

288
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:36,180
And when he started, you know,
working on me,

289
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:38,560
I was blindfolded, so...

290
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:42,940
Did you hear anything?
Did he have an accent or anything?

291
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:46,740
He didn't talk much, or he'd whisper.

292
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,030
And that's all you heard?

293
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,200
Except the rats.

294
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,700
Sometimes they would
crawl up on the bed,

295
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,790
and I'd have to shake 'em off.

296
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,130
Some crap-ass witness I am, huh?

297
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,630
You're doing fine. You've given us a lot.

298
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,760
Yeah?

299
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:16,220
You know, sometimes when I'm trying
to remember something, I close my eyes.

300
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:18,220
Really?

301
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,930
We could even blindfold you again.

302
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,320
I'm kind of tired right now.

303
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:35,030
It's OK. Get some rest.

304
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,540
Officer Morgan and I are leaving.

305
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,170
Alone.

306
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,170
No pretending. No hiding.

307
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:11,400
No time to relax.
I'm too close.

308
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:14,320
Jorge Castillo is bad. That I know.

309
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:17,580
But bad enough to have
killed Yelina's fiancé?

310
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,870
That I have to prove.

311
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,160
Jorge's not-so-humble abode.

312
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,750
New money.

313
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:32,550
Normal people dream of this -
a new car, a big home,

314
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,630
a boat at the reef shore marina...

315
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,930
and a beautiful wife.

316
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:43,020
Too bad - I never enjoy
making someone a widow.

317
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:45,520
They're so happy.

318
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,020
She has no clue who she's with.

319
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:53,280
Maybe that's the key
to a successful relationship.

320
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:57,820
Mr. Perry, you were on the grounds
of the same hospital

321
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:59,830
where we found Mr. Tucci.

322
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:02,250
And you were alone that night?

323
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:05,330
It was just me and Caesar, my dog.

324
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:09,130
He likes abandoned buildings.
Caesar's a ratter.

325
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:12,090
- What did this guy do?
- Why? Does he look familiar?

326
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:16,470
Yes, he looks like an actor
from that John Singleton movie.

327
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:17,840
"What was that?"

328
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:21,720
How about you focus on whether or not
he was the man at the old hospital?

329
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:25,020
Well, it was difficult to tell. It was dark.

330
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,810
You said you got a look at him.

331
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:33,820
He had a cap.

332
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:40,530
Hey, is that KG-230 hooked
into a digital CCTV network?

333
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,200
You better have a hell of a firewall.

334
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:44,910
You get better resolution with the 440.

335
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:45,960
Hello.

336
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,830
We're done here.

337
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,720
Give me a minute.

338
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,980
Morgan, thank Mr. Perry for his horseshit
and send him home.

339
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,150
Christ on a crutch,
he could tell us something.

340
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,980
Sergeant Doakes says he is a looky-loo.

341
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:15,360
We get dozens like that every
time a story hits the news.

342
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,450
Now do me a favor -
get him out of my precinct.

343
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:18,950
Thank you.

344
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:23,620
You could try being a little more optimistic.

345
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:27,290
I mean, if Tony Tucci can be optimistic,
I think we can.

346
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:29,290
You might get more out of people.

347
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,250
How do you know Perry
doesn't know anything?

348
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:35,800
Because I've been doing this
a lot longer than you.

349
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,840
This case is getting colder every minute
you waste on bullshit like Perry.

350
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:45,430
And wanting to blindfold a trauma victim?
What the fuck were you thinking?

351
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:49,440
Tucci's closed for business now,
and you shut him down.

352
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,110
I...

353
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,150
I was trying a new approach.

354
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:01,280
Maybe you should just learn the basics
before you reinvent the damn wheel.

355
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,850
Come on.
How can you not dance to this?

356
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:26,890
It's a gift.

357
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,060
You just need some more Patrón, compadre.

358
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:31,770
- Another round!
- No more for me.

359
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,650
I got to get up early, killers to catch.

360
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:34,860
Forget that.

361
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,150
The night's just beginning, right, ladies?

362
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,280
Yes!

363
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,280
Ladies, excuse us. Angel, come here.

364
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,780
Your wife - she's probably worrying.

365
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:46,450
I don't know what she'd think
of your new friend.

366
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:49,870
She don't mind who I flirt with
as long as I bring home la pasión.

367
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,370
Yeah, it keeps the relationship alive.

368
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:59,170
Hey, what about, communication, trust?

369
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:02,380
Wait.

370
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:05,050
What if she wants something more?

371
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:08,180
Then you reciprocate - you know.

372
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:11,060
No, I meant what if she wants
something more emotionally?

373
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,060
Don't go down that emotional road.

374
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:14,400
Just go down on her.

375
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,310
It's easier, and she'll be distracted.

376
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,900
Come on. Let's dance, Angel.

377
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:24,990
So...

378
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:31,200
What do you want to do now?

379
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:35,080
Dance with her, Dexter. Be polite.

380
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:37,840
Get her punch.
Open the door for her.

381
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:41,300
And if you find yourself alone with her
and things get romantic...

382
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,170
Dad, I've kissed a girl before.

383
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,880
- You have?
- Yeah.

384
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:46,340
And?

385
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:48,850
I don't know. It was OK.

386
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:54,060
- Dexter, women are different from men.
- We've had this talk, Dad.

387
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:57,400
I'm saying they have a whole
different experience of things.

388
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,400
When they're with someone, physically,
they feel connected.

389
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,240
And they know when you're not.

390
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,450
They can sense it
because you're very exposed.

391
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:05,910
You're naked.

392
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,910
I mean emotionally.

393
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:10,990
Son, this is going to be
very dangerous for you.

394
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,450
I can fake it.

395
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:16,580
Buddy, you can learn to fake a lot of things.

396
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,540
This is a tough one.

397
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,060
Is this it?

398
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:46,860
Angel, I've only been here one time.
I don't remember.

399
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:49,280
Wake up.

400
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,210
Your wife's gonna love me.

401
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,630
The problem with acting normal

402
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,840
is normal people get into
stupid situations like this.

403
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,390
You scared the hell out of me.

404
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,140
Sorry, Nina.

405
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:16,230
I'm Dexter. You remember?
I work with Angel down at the station.

406
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,600
What are you doing here?

407
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:22,770
It's funny. We were out celebrating
Angel's pay-grade bump.

408
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,480
He got a raise?

409
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:27,740
Yeah.

410
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:32,870
Well, as you can see,
he had a little too much to drink,

411
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:35,160
So I gave him a ride home.

412
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,370
He doesn't live here anymore.

413
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:44,300
We're separated.

414
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:50,300
So, good night.

415
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,140
OK.

416
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:56,350
Good night.

417
00:30:58,980 --> 00:30:59,980
Come on.

418
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,440
Angel.

419
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:11,110
Angel, we're really late for work, amigo.

420
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:18,120
I guess I had one too many, huh?

421
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:20,410
And then about ten more.

422
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:32,550
How did I end up here?

423
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,100
You don't remember?

424
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,220
So you live here, huh?

425
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,930
I live here.

426
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:45,520
You're kind of neat, aren't you?

427
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:48,190
Bad habit instilled by Mom.

428
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,090
We better get going.

429
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,760
Pressure's on with this
ice-truck killer situation.

430
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:17,760
Yeah. You go ahead. I'll lock up.

431
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:20,220
I have to stop by home anyway.

432
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:23,690
My wife's gonna be worried.
She gets so hot and bothered.

433
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:26,980
No, I'll just wait,
and I'll drop you at your car.

434
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:30,070
Where's your bathroom?

435
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,410
Somehow it's reassuring

436
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:38,410
to know I'm not the only one
pretending to be normal.

437
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,540
I found hair on this one
that doesn't belong to Tucci.

438
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,080
Rat hair.

439
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:45,630
I probably picked up a parasite...

440
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,460
Don't test me, Masuka.

441
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:51,670
See all that shredding?
Half of this sheet must be lining their nests.

442
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,510
They took evidence from the crime scene?

443
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:55,680
- Exactly.
- So we check their nest.

444
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:01,640
Wild-goose chase,
without knowing what we're looking for.

445
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:03,140
We could talk to Tucci again.

446
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,810
He knows more than he thinks,
and my gut tells me he can take it.

447
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,690
Cos you got the instincts
of a veteran on the force.

448
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,150
Masuka, run the sheet.

449
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,030
See if we can trace it to a manufacturer.

450
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:15,530
I've got court in the morning,
so call me on my cell.

451
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,660
I get it. I'm a newbie.

452
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:20,240
But you are old and tired,
and you need new eyes on this.

453
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:22,660
So when you're ready to let me do my job,
let me know.

454
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:25,210
And don't you fucking say a word, Masuka.

455
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,210
How do you get rid of the ones
who don't pay out?

456
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,840
You drop them
in the middle of the ocean,

457
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:38,220
tell them to swim for shore?

458
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,890
You can't hide for long, Jorge.

459
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,100
- Hello?
- Dexter, it's me.

460
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:48,940
Look, I'm sorry I haven't talked to you
since that place.

461
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,360
The morgue.

462
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,690
Do you think they'll be able
to catch whoever did this?

463
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,740
I'm sure he'll get what he deserves.

464
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,570
How are you doing?

465
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,280
Still a little shaky.

466
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:06,500
I have some late-night work I have to do,
but I could stop by earlier, if you want.

467
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,620
Maybe we could rent a movie.

468
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:11,000
Yeah, I'll pick up a DVD.

469
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:13,130
Something light.

470
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:31,440
Maybe if I don't blink, my eyes will tear up.

471
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:38,280
I hate this. I'm questioning every move.
It's exhausting.

472
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,240
I should just break it off already,

473
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:44,620
unless I can pacify her,

474
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,750
give her something.

475
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:50,960
Reciprocate.

476
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,840
Dexter?

477
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:04,010
I'm sorry. I...

478
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,970
I was just...

479
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:10,190
You were so generous with me.

480
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:13,440
I was gonna return the favor.

481
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:16,030
No, that's very sweet,

482
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:20,530
but sorry, I'm just not in the mood for that.

483
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:33,380
That you, Dex?

484
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,420
Yeah. Sorry I'm late.

485
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:40,170
It's OK, son.
You must have been having fun.

486
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,470
I pretended to.

487
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:42,760
That's good, Dexter.

488
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,390
Dad?

489
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:50,140
Do you think that maybe one day
I'll feel it for real?

490
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,020
I hope so, son.

491
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:00,190
I really do.

492
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:07,830
Alone, I'd be better off.

493
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:10,370
Relationships are too confusing.

494
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:15,000
But this I can figure out.

495
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:16,790
This I do well.

496
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,840
Jorge Castillo's boat.

497
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,090
If he's a killer, then there's proof.

498
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:24,340
There's always proof, and I'll find it.

499
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,530
Happy and in love.

500
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,110
The perfect couple.

501
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,950
I wonder if Rita and the kids
would like fishing.

502
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,330
Focus.

503
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:07,890
If one of these matches the contact number
for Ernesto's coyote,

504
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:09,680
you're it, Jorge.

505
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,100
He drowns them here,
then dumps them out there.

506
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,560
If they wash up, it'll be chalked up to
another inner-tube mishap.

507
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:04,090
Yep - this I do well.

508
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:09,840
Think about his shoes.

509
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:11,760
Did he walk with a limp?

510
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:16,060
Did he move smoothly, like an athlete?

511
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:20,020
Try to remember, Tony, for me.

512
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:23,520
I would if I could, hon.

513
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,990
You're a sweet lady, and smart -
using your charms on me.

514
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:32,030
No, no, I don't mind.

515
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:36,160
It's probably the last time
a woman will flirt with me, looking like this.

516
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,580
It's OK, Tony.

517
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,250
Maybe later.

518
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,670
We should try the blindfold.

519
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,210
What?

520
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,670
- I don't want to do that.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Tucci.

521
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,840
I can't even begin to imagine
what you've been through,

522
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:54,800
but it's our job to make sure
that nobody else goes through it, too.

523
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:57,010
So, Morgan, you're up.

524
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:24,420
He was hard to hear.
I never knew where he was.

525
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:27,880
So he's agile. That's good, Tony.
What else did you hear?

526
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:32,930
Rats. Always those damn rats.

527
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:35,050
Try to focus on him, Tony.

528
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:39,060
What did you hear?
What did you smell?

529
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,190
- Menthol.
- Menthol?

530
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,360
Yeah, like cough drops.

531
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:50,360
He cleared his throat a lot.
You know, like...

532
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,950
He unwrapped 'em.

533
00:40:57,410 --> 00:41:01,080
I could hear those wrappers,
that crinkly sound.

534
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,080
And he sucked on 'em.

535
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:11,630
I could hear 'em clicking
against his teeth when he...

536
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:23,350
The son of a bitch
loved those fucking lozenges.

537
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,860
Come on, pretty girl. Come on.

538
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,320
Nothing in this nest.

539
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:39,030
Check another floor.
They're all over this dump.

540
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:41,790
Fuck this.

541
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:47,460
Masuka.

542
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:50,540
We got another one over here.

543
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:54,300
Promising.
Several fragments from the sheet here.

544
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:57,720
These rat bastards
were repeat customers.

545
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:02,350
Who had garlic for lunch?

546
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:04,350
I'm gonna punch you in the neck.

547
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,850
Actually...

548
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:09,190
I think you're gonna French me.

549
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:22,830
...934.

550
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:26,080
I like being right.

551
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,830
I usually am about these things.

552
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:36,220
"Be prepared." It's my motto.

553
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:38,930
The boy scouts and I
have that in common.

554
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:42,220
Of course, there's no merit badge
for tonight's outing.

555
00:43:03,370 --> 00:43:05,120
What are we looking at?

556
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,750
They found the ice-truck killer's
lozenge wrapper,

557
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:10,120
thanks to your sister.

558
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:12,080
Lozenge wrapper?

559
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:14,210
After two months of finding
fuck all in this case,

560
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,590
a lozenge wrapper's the damn holy grail.

561
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:19,630
My favorite serial killer
is a lozenge eater.

562
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:21,470
How human of him.

563
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:27,350
We have a partial.

564
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:31,350
- Partial print! A partial fucking print!
- Let me see.

565
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,900
Proud of you, sis.

566
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,190
It's a celebration here.
Where are you going?

567
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,650
Crime scene.

568
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,070
Excuse me.

569
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:41,950
What's... What's going on?

570
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:44,990
We've got our first piece of tangible evidence
on the ice-truck killer.

571
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,660
- A partial fucking print.
- You run it through AFIS yet?

572
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:50,290
- We're workin' on it.
- It doesn't even matter if we get a match.

573
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:52,420
He gets pulled in for anything, we got him.

574
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:54,250
Get it photoed before we scan it.

575
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:58,460
And I want Labelle to ID
the points of comparison if you get an AFIS hit.

576
00:43:58,590 --> 00:44:00,970
Masuka, I want that thing
swabbed for DNA.

577
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:03,590
And let's keep working
the old hospital site, people.

578
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,800
We might get lucky again.

579
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:08,600
It wasn't luck. Good work, Morgan.

580
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,780
Come on.

581
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,410
Come on.

582
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:34,460
Come on!

583
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:04,260
God bless America.

584
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:15,430
Hon?

585
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,190
Where are you?

586
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,730
Honey?

587
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:35,250
Honey, you in here?

588
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:50,720
Get back in there, you Cuban piece of shit!

589
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:56,600
Fucking animals.

590
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,940
Incredible.

591
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:02,270
They're an even better match
than I thought.

592
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,400
A true partnership.

593
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:16,330
You know, I rarely deviate from a plan,

594
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:19,660
but I just didn't have the heart
to split up such a...

595
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:22,790
perfect couple.

596
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,550
You two...

597
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:33,640
have quite a lucrative operation going.

598
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:37,020
You're a really good team.

599
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,560
It's clever, too.

600
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:49,530
No one questions
another drowned Cuban man

601
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:51,660
or woman...

602
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:54,660
or child.

603
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:56,330
So, which one of you thought this up?

604
00:47:56,450 --> 00:47:59,000
They get freedom. We free them.

605
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,910
They thank us, for God's sake.

606
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:05,710
For drowning them and dumping
their bodies in the ocean? Please.

607
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:08,510
We can pay you. We have money.

608
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:11,380
That's what it's all about, right?

609
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,840
- I love you.
- I love you so much.

610
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:16,010
I love you so much.

611
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:27,230
I'm gonna ask you a question.
I want you to answer me honestly.

612
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,690
No more bullshit.
Do you understand?

613
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:33,990
How long have you been married?

614
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:36,120
12 years.

615
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,370
How do you love each other?

616
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:44,670
You're like me,
and you make it work. How?

617
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:46,330
We want the same life.

618
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:48,590
We both... We want the same thing.

619
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:50,460
Same life.

620
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:52,510
You share the same dream.

621
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:53,800
Yes, exactly, yes.

622
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:56,050
Yes, that's it.

623
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:58,140
That's...

624
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:02,390
helpful.

625
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:04,350
Thank you.

626
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:54,880
I like doing things properly,

627
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:58,010
but I'm out of time
and I still have to dispose of them.

628
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:03,140
Valerie got short shrift.

629
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:07,390
But all in all, it was a very good night.

630
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:06,160
I like this place.
A lot of memories are buried down there.

631
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:15,170
Deviating from the plan
may have been ill-advised.

632
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:32,730
But sometimes
you just have to take a risk.

633
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,700
After all...

634
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:53,410
isn't that what
relationships are all about?

635
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:15,310
Do you have a dream...

636
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,780
for your life?

637
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:24,530
Your future, I guess?

638
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:26,490
Of course.

639
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:28,660
Do you?

640
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:32,200
It might sound weird.

641
00:53:40,130 --> 00:53:42,380
I want to someday be content,

642
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:45,090
just to feel...

643
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:50,850
comfortable, like everyone else.

644
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:54,640
- I want...
- A normal life.

645
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:02,440
Yeah, a normal life.

646
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,110
That's all I want.

647
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,160
Just that.

648
00:54:08,030 --> 00:54:10,410
No fame and fortune,

649
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:12,540
excitement at every turn?

650
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,170
No, I've had enough excitement.

651
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:18,750
Thank you.

652
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,670
Now, I'll take boring.

653
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:23,800
Average.

654
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:26,340
Ordinary.

655
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:30,800
That's weird, huh?

656
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:36,230
Yeah.
