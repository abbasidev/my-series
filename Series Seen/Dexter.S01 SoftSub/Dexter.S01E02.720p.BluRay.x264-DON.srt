1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:04,380
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:06,180
Tonight's the night.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,390
And it's going to happen again and again...

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:11,640
Has to happen.

5
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:13,270
There he is.

6
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,480
He's the one.

7
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:20,610
You're mine now, so do exactly as I say.

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,990
- You better be a cop.
- No. Forensics.

9
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:27,740
There is no blood near the body.
It's the weirdest thing you ever saw.

10
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,989
I've never seen such clean,
dry, neat-looking dead flesh.

11
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,039
How does the killer get rid of the blood?

12
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,909
One of these days, you're gonna tell me.

13
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:38,669
I told you blood spatter
doesn't take up all my time.

14
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:41,629
- How was your date with Rita last night?
- Great.

15
00:00:41,749 --> 00:00:43,499
She's perfect because Rita is,

16
00:00:43,629 --> 00:00:45,919
in her own way, as damaged as me.

17
00:00:46,089 --> 00:00:48,969
Open your eyes and look at what you did!

18
00:00:49,089 --> 00:00:53,259
- Please, you have to understand.
- Trust me. I definitely understand.

19
00:00:57,229 --> 00:00:59,269
- Hello?
- What are you doing now?

20
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,149
Just finishing up a project,
but I'll come by later.

21
00:01:02,269 --> 00:01:04,029
- They found another hooker.
- Another?

22
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:05,819
The third one in five months.

23
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:08,819
- Third? You mean there's a...
- A serial killer, right.

24
00:01:08,949 --> 00:01:12,239
There are people out there
who do really bad things.

25
00:01:12,369 --> 00:01:14,659
Learn how to spot them. I can teach you.

26
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:19,459
The killer flayed the skin, the flesh, completely
off. Now, why would he do that?

27
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,999
He's experimenting to find the right way.

28
00:01:22,129 --> 00:01:27,009
He's certainly raising the bar.
Damn, this guy is good.

29
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:28,379
The killer is an artist.

30
00:01:28,509 --> 00:01:30,588
You give me the fucking creeps,
you know that?

31
00:01:30,718 --> 00:01:32,388
Yeah, I know. Sorry about that.

32
00:01:32,508 --> 00:01:36,098
But now we have a fourth body,
and the cuts were different.

33
00:01:36,228 --> 00:01:38,728
That's telling us a story.
The ritual is changing.

34
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:41,558
I'd like to check and see
if any refrigerated trucks

35
00:01:41,688 --> 00:01:43,978
have been stolen in the last week or so.

36
00:01:46,988 --> 00:01:48,358
It just seems odd.

37
00:01:48,488 --> 00:01:52,778
Your sister has this ice-truck theory,
and then here you are to back it up.

38
00:01:52,908 --> 00:01:55,578
She's good, Lieutenant.
You should give her a chance.

39
00:01:56,828 --> 00:01:58,658
I think this is a friendly message.

40
00:01:58,788 --> 00:02:00,748
"Hey, wanna play?"

41
00:02:00,868 --> 00:02:05,038
And, yes, I wanna play. I really, really do.

42
00:04:12,966 --> 00:04:14,626
I dream.

43
00:04:17,796 --> 00:04:22,256
I dream I'm floating
on the surface of my own life,

44
00:04:22,386 --> 00:04:25,386
watching it unfold, observing it.

45
00:04:26,805 --> 00:04:28,805
I'm the outsider, looking in.

46
00:04:40,485 --> 00:04:42,275
Yeah!

47
00:04:42,405 --> 00:04:45,365
Oh, you want to play, man? Come on!

48
00:04:45,495 --> 00:04:47,035
In the water!

49
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:52,285
Look at them.
They can laugh and play.

50
00:04:52,415 --> 00:04:54,505
It comes so easily for them.

51
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:59,255
Even though I'm not one of them,

52
00:04:59,385 --> 00:05:02,845
even though sometimes
I can really be a monster...

53
00:05:03,635 --> 00:05:05,635
today, I'm just...

54
00:05:06,685 --> 00:05:08,345
a sea monster.

55
00:05:25,494 --> 00:05:29,454
Soon enough, I'll have to go back
to doing what I do...

56
00:05:29,574 --> 00:05:34,124
so I make a point of enjoying days like this
when I have them.

57
00:05:48,844 --> 00:05:50,384
Just a second.

58
00:05:51,394 --> 00:05:55,434
The ice-truck killer left me
a gruesome souvenir.

59
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:58,434
Explaining it could be kind of...

60
00:05:58,564 --> 00:06:00,484
awkward.

61
00:06:01,234 --> 00:06:04,154
- Hey.
- Bagels, brother. Let me in.

62
00:06:10,824 --> 00:06:13,204
Could it be more depressing in here?

63
00:06:14,244 --> 00:06:16,874
Got anything to drink?
It's hot as hell out there.

64
00:06:17,004 --> 00:06:18,374
OJ?

65
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:19,964
With ice.

66
00:06:24,753 --> 00:06:26,303
So, how you doing?

67
00:06:26,423 --> 00:06:27,633
I'm fine.

68
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:29,223
Yeah, things are fine.

69
00:06:29,343 --> 00:06:33,973
Breakfast, which I already had, was fine,
but you know me, I'm always hungry.

70
00:06:41,023 --> 00:06:42,693
So, what's up, hotshot?

71
00:06:42,813 --> 00:06:44,483
All right, get this.

72
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:46,613
Lieutenant's looking
for that refrigerated truck

73
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:50,073
in every swamp, glade, and chop shop
from here to the Keys.

74
00:06:50,203 --> 00:06:51,783
But the way I see it...

75
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:56,703
that whackjob truck driver
threw a severed head at your car.

76
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,083
It's not as if he's shy.

77
00:06:58,203 --> 00:07:01,463
You think he hid the truck in plain sight,
wanting it to be found?

78
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:05,003
I could answer that if LaGuerta
didn't have me back with my hookers.

79
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:08,303
- That truck is your ticket into Homicide.
- Tell me about it.

80
00:07:08,423 --> 00:07:11,513
Just because LaGuerta has you
looking for hookers on her time

81
00:07:11,633 --> 00:07:14,763
- doesn't mean you can't look for the truck...
- On my time.

82
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:18,973
- What's with these?
- I've got court.

83
00:07:21,312 --> 00:07:24,812
Why is it we never talk brother-sister stuff?

84
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,862
Our dad was a cop. You're a cop.
I work for the cops.

85
00:07:27,982 --> 00:07:30,442
For us, this is brother-sister stuff.

86
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,912
Brings out your eyes.

87
00:07:39,452 --> 00:07:41,702
First he throws a severed head at me,

88
00:07:41,832 --> 00:07:43,912
then he leaves me these doll parts,

89
00:07:44,042 --> 00:07:46,252
like pieces of a puzzle.

90
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:47,922
I like puzzles.

91
00:07:55,682 --> 00:07:58,932
But there's nothing more frustrating
than putting a puzzle together

92
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:02,522
and finding that it still doesn't make sense.

93
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,072
Please state your name and occupation.

94
00:08:10,192 --> 00:08:13,152
My name is Dexter Morgan,
and I'm a forensics specialist

95
00:08:13,282 --> 00:08:16,742
in blood-spatter analysis
for the Miami Metro Police Department.

96
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:19,742
And how long have you been
doing blood-spatter analysis?

97
00:08:19,871 --> 00:08:21,121
Almost 12 years.

98
00:08:21,241 --> 00:08:23,411
You've been involved in quite a few cases.

99
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:25,581
2,103.

100
00:08:25,711 --> 00:08:27,631
Give or take.

101
00:08:27,751 --> 00:08:30,131
No, 2,103.

102
00:08:31,051 --> 00:08:33,761
Then it's safe to say blood is your life.

103
00:08:36,011 --> 00:08:37,511
Safe to say.

104
00:08:37,641 --> 00:08:39,721
Unlike the other guys
down at the station,

105
00:08:39,851 --> 00:08:44,851
I love coming to court to rub shoulders with the
good people of the Sunshine State...

106
00:08:44,981 --> 00:08:47,101
and Sasquatch.

107
00:08:47,231 --> 00:08:50,901
In a courthouse,
everyone's on their best behavior...

108
00:08:53,691 --> 00:08:55,491
like they're being watched.

109
00:09:00,161 --> 00:09:01,911
And they are.

110
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,831
Some people would look at this family
and see only tragedy and heartbreak.

111
00:09:05,961 --> 00:09:08,461
But I see so much more than that.

112
00:09:09,211 --> 00:09:11,751
I'll do this, OK?

113
00:09:14,211 --> 00:09:16,091
I see opportunity.

114
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:24,010
Alexander Pryce finished his homework, kissed
his mom, went out for a jog.

115
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:29,270
He told her he'd be back in time to take out the
trash cans. Just another night, until...

116
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,150
until the defendant not only struck him
with his car, but fled the scene,

117
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,320
leaving Alexander Pryce alone and dying
for hours

118
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:40,110
before his body was found the next morning.

119
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,450
From heinous to unspeakable.

120
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,700
The people will prove that not only
did Mr. Chambers

121
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,870
strike and kill Alexander Pryce,

122
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,840
but did so while once again
under the influence of alcohol.

123
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,710
Happy birthday, Alex!

124
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,670
- Thank you.
- Rip right into it.

125
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,760
What?

126
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,180
Yeah. Hope it's money.

127
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,800
Yeah, you wish.

128
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:06,310
Thanks, guys. It's like 80 degrees out.

129
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:11,310
But next year at this time,
we're coming to visit you at Harvard.

130
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:16,030
- It's everything I've ever wanted for you.
- Thanks, Dad.

131
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,699
All right, enough corniness.

132
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:21,489
I see their pain.

133
00:10:22,449 --> 00:10:25,409
On some level,
I even understand their pain.

134
00:10:26,449 --> 00:10:28,579
I just can't feel their pain.

135
00:10:33,999 --> 00:10:39,509
It's a matter of time before we see how far Matt
Chambers' crocodile tears get him.

136
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:42,509
But until then...

137
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:47,719
a little of my favorite tropical fruit.

138
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:52,389
The perfect driving food
next to a pulled-pork sandwich.

139
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:55,019
Also, I can keep my energy up
for the day job.

140
00:11:25,798 --> 00:11:28,178
Detective!

141
00:11:28,308 --> 00:11:29,348
Did we get an ID?

142
00:11:29,468 --> 00:11:32,098
First on scene pulled the wallet.
We're still waiting.

143
00:11:32,228 --> 00:11:34,348
Hello, Dex.

144
00:11:34,478 --> 00:11:36,608
Our boss - Lieutenant LaGuerta.

145
00:11:36,728 --> 00:11:41,778
In keeping with her total sense of entitlement,
she has this attraction to me.

146
00:11:41,898 --> 00:11:43,488
And I thought I was creepy.

147
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:49,948
Given the skin rupture and the secondary
spatter, distance had to be a 50, 60ft drop.

148
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:52,448
The eastbound's only 40ft.

149
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:54,958
It's not high enough
for this kind of damage.

150
00:11:55,078 --> 00:11:58,918
Best guess, originating point
is the westbound causeway.

151
00:11:59,998 --> 00:12:02,838
Hey! Get me a team
on the westbound causeway!

152
00:12:02,968 --> 00:12:04,468
She's good.

153
00:12:04,588 --> 00:12:06,338
Angel, look at this.

154
00:12:08,468 --> 00:12:11,428
I think there's something in his mouth.

155
00:12:13,228 --> 00:12:14,227
Medic!

156
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:24,107
Ah, it's just a death rattle. He's gonzo.

157
00:12:24,237 --> 00:12:28,737
You better check out my friend, too.
No telling what this guy might have had.

158
00:12:32,247 --> 00:12:33,907
This is what he had.

159
00:12:35,327 --> 00:12:38,287
Call me crazy, Angel,
but I think this is human flesh.

160
00:13:06,567 --> 00:13:08,527
Hooked up with Sean last night.

161
00:13:09,567 --> 00:13:10,947
The cable guy Sean?

162
00:13:11,077 --> 00:13:12,487
Oh, God, no.

163
00:13:12,616 --> 00:13:14,656
He smelled like cheese.

164
00:13:14,786 --> 00:13:17,786
- So the mechanic Sean?
- Yep.

165
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:19,786
He came over.

166
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:22,246
We opened a bottle of pinot grig'.

167
00:13:22,376 --> 00:13:24,296
We finished a bottle of pinot grig'.

168
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:26,046
Before I knew it, we were...

169
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,176
Stop that.

170
00:13:28,296 --> 00:13:30,886
- You don't want to hear this, do you?
- No.

171
00:13:31,006 --> 00:13:34,256
But if you two are getting serious,
I'd love to meet him.

172
00:13:34,386 --> 00:13:35,886
Why don't you and Sean the mechanic

173
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:38,886
join me and Rita the girlfriend for dinner
tomorrow night?

174
00:13:39,016 --> 00:13:42,556
Why? So you can tell me later
he's not good enough for your little sister?

175
00:13:42,686 --> 00:13:46,486
Don't. You're the one who was going on about
brother-and-sister stuff.

176
00:13:46,606 --> 00:13:50,356
That becomes brother-and-sister
double-dating? What goes on in your head?

177
00:13:50,486 --> 00:13:51,906
Come on. It'll be fun.

178
00:13:52,026 --> 00:13:55,196
All right, we'll go, but I'm not promising
we'll have fun.

179
00:13:55,906 --> 00:13:57,036
Not now.

180
00:13:57,156 --> 00:13:58,866
What crawled up his ass?

181
00:13:58,996 --> 00:14:00,786
He hates lab rats.

182
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:06,086
Well, here's a headline... It's lab rats
that make us cops look good.

183
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:09,546
OK, listen up.

184
00:14:09,676 --> 00:14:12,755
We just got an ID on the body
from under the causeway.

185
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:15,255
His name is Ricky Simmons.

186
00:14:15,385 --> 00:14:17,425
He was a cop.

187
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:36,485
- Let me ask you something.
- Yeah.

188
00:14:36,615 --> 00:14:39,245
When we were partners,
you used every excuse in the book

189
00:14:39,365 --> 00:14:41,705
to get out of making
a next-of-kin notification.

190
00:14:41,825 --> 00:14:45,785
I knew Ricky from the department softball
team. He was a good guy, a good cop.

191
00:14:45,915 --> 00:14:47,585
It's the least I could do.

192
00:14:55,965 --> 00:14:56,965
Motherfucker!

193
00:15:01,635 --> 00:15:03,305
Call it in!

194
00:15:05,355 --> 00:15:10,274
3H-77 to dispatch. We need EMT
and police backup now.

195
00:15:10,394 --> 00:15:12,144
I'll check the house.

196
00:15:12,274 --> 00:15:14,484
Kara, it's me. It's James.

197
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:16,524
You're OK.

198
00:15:19,034 --> 00:15:22,154
Hey, it's me.

199
00:15:22,954 --> 00:15:24,954
It's OK.

200
00:15:25,954 --> 00:15:27,834
This is so fucked-up, man.

201
00:15:30,874 --> 00:15:32,754
Going after a cop's family...

202
00:15:33,794 --> 00:15:36,794
- Who would do such a thing?
- That's why we're here.

203
00:15:37,844 --> 00:15:39,634
But it's still fucked-up.

204
00:15:40,174 --> 00:15:43,974
They say Ricky Simmons was under deep
cover in Carlos Guerrero's family.

205
00:15:44,094 --> 00:15:45,264
All right. Thanks.

206
00:15:45,394 --> 00:15:48,314
He'd been working the gig for ten months and
everything was good.

207
00:15:48,974 --> 00:15:51,644
But this, going after his wife...

208
00:15:52,694 --> 00:15:54,854
Guerrero's crossing a whole new line.

209
00:15:55,734 --> 00:15:59,734
Now he's gone and pissed off
the entire Miami Police Department.

210
00:16:00,654 --> 00:16:03,574
- Is there any word on the wife?
- She should be in surgery by now.

211
00:16:06,954 --> 00:16:09,793
There's an inconsistency somewhere.

212
00:16:09,913 --> 00:16:11,203
- And that would be?
- I'm not sure,

213
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:14,753
but it's the answer to
a question we haven't thought of yet.

214
00:16:22,343 --> 00:16:24,343
Look.

215
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:32,563
- Whose is it?
- Probably hers.

216
00:16:33,143 --> 00:16:35,943
Ricky Simmons, her husband,
last number dialed.

217
00:16:41,363 --> 00:16:42,823
I got it.

218
00:16:42,943 --> 00:16:44,193
Good work, Angel.

219
00:16:44,323 --> 00:16:47,243
- Well, actually, it was Dexter.
- Sergeant?

220
00:16:49,283 --> 00:16:53,083
98, 99, 100!

221
00:16:53,203 --> 00:16:56,623
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a new world record!

222
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:58,883
Stop it!

223
00:16:59,003 --> 00:17:00,503
Can't stop. Must tickle.

224
00:17:00,633 --> 00:17:02,213
Got to hear the magic word!

225
00:17:02,343 --> 00:17:05,053
I have your magic word right here -
chocolate chip.

226
00:17:05,553 --> 00:17:08,092
- Cookies!
- Homemade.

227
00:17:08,222 --> 00:17:11,852
OK, you guys,
take your cookies into the bedroom.

228
00:17:11,972 --> 00:17:15,312
- Two each.
- But you never let us eat in our bedroom.

229
00:17:16,022 --> 00:17:18,402
Well, I want some alone time with Dexter.

230
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:23,612
- Are you gonna kiss him?
- Actually, yes.

231
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:24,782
Cool.

232
00:17:24,902 --> 00:17:25,992
Gross!

233
00:17:30,742 --> 00:17:32,122
Cookie?

234
00:17:32,992 --> 00:17:35,162
I wuv cookies.

235
00:17:36,412 --> 00:17:38,752
You're snarfing them down
like the cookie monster.

236
00:17:38,882 --> 00:17:42,922
No, this isn't snarfing.
This is eating with enthusiasm.

237
00:17:44,262 --> 00:17:46,212
Tell me about your day.

238
00:17:46,922 --> 00:17:49,842
I had court, you know, the blood thing.

239
00:17:49,972 --> 00:17:54,182
And then a crime scene and more blood.

240
00:17:54,852 --> 00:17:57,602
- I don't know how you do it.
- Well, blood is...

241
00:17:57,732 --> 00:17:58,642
My life.

242
00:17:58,772 --> 00:18:00,022
...my job.

243
00:18:00,152 --> 00:18:02,732
Lately, the thing that surprises me most about
Rita

244
00:18:02,862 --> 00:18:04,402
is how much I like being with her.

245
00:18:05,192 --> 00:18:06,821
But whenever that happens
with a woman,

246
00:18:06,941 --> 00:18:10,451
when I feel comfortable with her,
it all goes wrong.

247
00:18:10,571 --> 00:18:14,161
That's why I think it's best
to take it one step at a time.

248
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:19,871
Hey, you know, Deb has been all over me for
us to get together with her new boyfriend.

249
00:18:20,001 --> 00:18:22,671
You think you can get a baby-sitter
some night?

250
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:25,301
You mean an actual grown-up meal?

251
00:18:25,421 --> 00:18:28,011
I'd love that. Pick a date.

252
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:30,631
I pick you.

253
00:18:32,181 --> 00:18:34,811
And I pick my sister to chaperone.

254
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:05,750
Sister.

255
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,670
So, Miami's the haystack,

256
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,050
and the ice truck's the needle, right?

257
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:11,300
OK.

258
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:15,850
Then brother,
I just found the fucking needle.

259
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:23,730
How did you find it?

260
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,570
I put the word out with patrol,
the hide-in-plain-sight thing.

261
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:29,780
Juan Pierre flagged this one and called me.

262
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,200
This is a busy street.
Anyone see the driver?

263
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,740
The restaurant manager said it was here when
he opened. Is this the one you saw?

264
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:41,080
I feel like a kid at his own surprise party.
This is the same truck.

265
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:44,120
It's hard to say. It all happened so fast.

266
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:51,130
Let's go on a nonforensic-geek limb here and
say that it is. Why is it still running?

267
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:54,220
It keeps the back compartment refrigerated.

268
00:20:03,899 --> 00:20:06,809
Holy shit, they're fucking fingertips.

269
00:20:10,689 --> 00:20:13,069
Clean slices, no blood.

270
00:20:16,069 --> 00:20:19,909
My guess is he drained the body entirely
before these cuts were made.

271
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:21,789
How did he do that? Some kind of pump?

272
00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:23,409
No.

273
00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:26,499
I had Forensics do a work-up
on our last victim.

274
00:20:26,629 --> 00:20:28,459
Our guy's old school.

275
00:20:28,589 --> 00:20:31,049
He hoists the body up, severs the jugular.

276
00:20:31,169 --> 00:20:32,759
The heart does all the work.

277
00:20:32,879 --> 00:20:35,929
It's the most effective method, really.

278
00:20:36,049 --> 00:20:37,889
Fucking butcher.

279
00:20:39,889 --> 00:20:42,769
There are 206 bones
in the human body.

280
00:20:42,889 --> 00:20:45,979
He could have left any one of them.

281
00:20:46,099 --> 00:20:49,809
But he gave us exactly what we need
to identify the victim,

282
00:20:49,939 --> 00:20:53,529
like he's leaving a trail of bread crumbs.

283
00:20:56,949 --> 00:20:58,659
Who made the find?

284
00:20:58,779 --> 00:21:00,489
Officer Morgan.

285
00:21:00,619 --> 00:21:02,488
Harry's daughter?

286
00:21:02,618 --> 00:21:05,158
Must be in the genes,
her and her brother.

287
00:21:06,038 --> 00:21:08,748
This truck's a good get.
It's their first solid lead.

288
00:21:08,878 --> 00:21:12,418
I encourage all my officers
to think outside the box.

289
00:21:12,548 --> 00:21:14,548
Well, nice work, Lieutenant.

290
00:21:14,668 --> 00:21:16,468
I got the Deputy Mayor.

291
00:21:16,968 --> 00:21:18,968
Congratulate Morgan for me.

292
00:21:29,898 --> 00:21:31,688
Another beautiful Miami day,

293
00:21:31,818 --> 00:21:34,898
mutilated corpses with the chance of afternoon
showers.

294
00:21:35,028 --> 00:21:37,648
Chalk one up for Miami Metro, eh, ma'am?

295
00:21:37,778 --> 00:21:40,698
Last time I checked, Morgan,
I'm the lieutenant,

296
00:21:40,828 --> 00:21:45,578
which means my officers keep me apprised at
all times on all things.

297
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:49,708
You pull a stunt like that again,
it won't matter who your father was.

298
00:21:49,828 --> 00:21:50,828
OK?

299
00:22:19,107 --> 00:22:20,737
Dude, is this blood?

300
00:22:20,867 --> 00:22:23,027
It's chocolate. It's on your shirt, too.

301
00:22:26,697 --> 00:22:28,617
It's a new shirt.

302
00:22:29,867 --> 00:22:32,957
- What is taking so long?
- It's a big truck.

303
00:22:33,087 --> 00:22:35,917
They won't find anything,
not even a tic tac.

304
00:22:36,047 --> 00:22:38,257
He's thought all this through.

305
00:22:38,377 --> 00:22:40,427
I know I would.

306
00:22:40,547 --> 00:22:43,597
- Your famous hunches telling you anything?
- Ice-cold.

307
00:22:43,717 --> 00:22:46,847
You're a goddamn riot.
This fucking guy's toying with us.

308
00:22:47,557 --> 00:22:51,807
Deb's right.
This truck's not another piece of the puzzle.

309
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:53,307
They are.

310
00:22:58,736 --> 00:23:00,856
Watching ice melt. This is fun.

311
00:23:00,986 --> 00:23:03,276
Stand closer, Morgan,
and I'll melt your heart.

312
00:23:03,406 --> 00:23:05,406
I think he's got a crush on you, Dex.

313
00:23:06,696 --> 00:23:10,616
Yo, I was talking to Morgan the sister.
Vince Masuka only swings one way.

314
00:23:10,746 --> 00:23:11,996
Yeah, from vine to vine.

315
00:23:12,116 --> 00:23:13,286
Enough.

316
00:23:13,416 --> 00:23:17,706
I'm glad to see the sexual harassment seminar
really paid off.

317
00:23:32,976 --> 00:23:35,436
This is seriously fucked-up, my friends.

318
00:23:37,226 --> 00:23:38,936
Why go to all this trouble?

319
00:23:39,936 --> 00:23:42,816
What's this sick son of a bitch
trying to tell us?

320
00:23:42,946 --> 00:23:45,316
Not "us". Me.

321
00:23:45,446 --> 00:23:48,946
My freezer,
the painted doll's fingernails...

322
00:23:51,326 --> 00:23:54,036
I think he's trying to impress me.

323
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:56,166
And it's working.

324
00:23:56,286 --> 00:23:59,545
What, a man can't call his wife
three times in one day?

325
00:24:03,545 --> 00:24:06,755
Kiss my baby and tell her,
"Daddy be home para la cena."

326
00:24:06,885 --> 00:24:08,805
I'm getting another call.

327
00:24:08,925 --> 00:24:10,215
Yeah, te amo.

328
00:24:11,135 --> 00:24:12,975
Batista.

329
00:24:13,935 --> 00:24:16,185
I'll be there in two minutes.

330
00:24:17,935 --> 00:24:19,355
She's still in surgery.

331
00:24:19,475 --> 00:24:20,975
The doctors are hopeful.

332
00:24:21,525 --> 00:24:24,695
Ice-truck killer returns,
dead undercover cop.

333
00:24:24,815 --> 00:24:26,735
It's a typical day in the neighborhood.

334
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:28,865
You got to hear this.

335
00:24:31,695 --> 00:24:34,115
Ricky, where the fuck are you?

336
00:24:34,495 --> 00:24:36,535
I'm gonna try for the back door.

337
00:24:36,665 --> 00:24:38,125
Oh, fuck, he saw me!

338
00:24:38,245 --> 00:24:40,375
Oh, please don't hurt me!

339
00:24:42,625 --> 00:24:46,335
Lieutenant. National database
kicked back the DNA match.

340
00:24:48,255 --> 00:24:49,505
Norberto Cervantes.

341
00:24:51,885 --> 00:24:54,055
Let me see that.

342
00:25:29,134 --> 00:25:31,884
- Get down!
- Police! Put your hands up! Police!

343
00:25:32,554 --> 00:25:33,844
- Get them down!
- Down!

344
00:25:33,964 --> 00:25:36,514
Put your fucking hands up!
Put your hands up!

345
00:25:41,224 --> 00:25:44,564
- Is that necessary?
- It's a dangerous world, Guerrero.

346
00:25:47,274 --> 00:25:49,904
Yes, and one can't be too careful, Detective.

347
00:25:55,323 --> 00:25:57,033
Yes, I-I've had alc...

348
00:25:57,533 --> 00:26:01,493
Problems with alcohol in the past.
I never tried to hide that.

349
00:26:02,033 --> 00:26:02,993
But...

350
00:26:03,123 --> 00:26:05,123
you heard from my AA sponsor.

351
00:26:05,253 --> 00:26:07,873
I've been sober for over a year now, so...

352
00:26:09,423 --> 00:26:13,293
Look, I...
I'm not disputing that it was my car...

353
00:26:14,633 --> 00:26:16,973
that hit Mr. Pryce.

354
00:26:17,593 --> 00:26:19,803
But...

355
00:26:19,933 --> 00:26:23,603
I reported it stolen
hours before the accident.

356
00:26:28,443 --> 00:26:32,563
Men like Matt Chambers know how to pull on
the invisible mask of sympathy,

357
00:26:32,693 --> 00:26:34,023
even empathy,

358
00:26:34,153 --> 00:26:38,243
and otherwise right-thinking people
don't stand a chance.

359
00:26:43,783 --> 00:26:45,493
I knew it.

360
00:26:45,623 --> 00:26:47,503
"Not guilty."

361
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:51,623
Matt Chambers may have found
a way to beat the system...

362
00:26:52,672 --> 00:26:54,422
but so have I.

363
00:26:55,752 --> 00:26:57,962
Ricky, where the fuck are you?

364
00:26:58,552 --> 00:27:00,592
Oh, fuck, he saw me!

365
00:27:00,722 --> 00:27:02,762
Oh, please don't hurt me!

366
00:27:07,472 --> 00:27:10,442
The way we see it,
you're in on the kill of Ricky Simmons,

367
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:13,522
but that's not enough for you
or for Guerrero.

368
00:27:13,652 --> 00:27:15,652
Ricky is dead?

369
00:27:16,822 --> 00:27:19,822
- That saddens me.
- Shut the fuck up!

370
00:27:25,412 --> 00:27:28,832
Wait, you're not implying that
Ricky Simmons was a cop, are you?

371
00:27:29,752 --> 00:27:31,372
I'm truly disappointed.

372
00:27:31,502 --> 00:27:33,962
Not only do I have a dead cop,

373
00:27:34,082 --> 00:27:37,592
someone broke in his house
and shot his wife.

374
00:27:37,712 --> 00:27:41,012
Word out in the world, Sergeant...

375
00:27:42,132 --> 00:27:43,972
Simmons's wife was fucking around.

376
00:27:45,182 --> 00:27:47,722
Maybe he tried to kill the bitch himself,

377
00:27:47,852 --> 00:27:50,682
and felt so bad about it,
he committed suicide.

378
00:27:51,561 --> 00:27:52,981
A cop murder-suicide.

379
00:27:54,101 --> 00:27:56,401
It's a health crisis for you guys, ain't it?

380
00:27:58,151 --> 00:28:01,071
You think it's a fucking coincidence
your ass is in here?

381
00:28:01,201 --> 00:28:04,321
We got you on the causeway
the morning Ricky Simmons died!

382
00:28:04,451 --> 00:28:07,241
- Bullshit.
- We don't deal in bullshit.

383
00:28:08,161 --> 00:28:10,081
We deal in good police work.

384
00:28:10,201 --> 00:28:12,911
And good science.

385
00:28:18,171 --> 00:28:21,301
You must have been a motherfucker
at cat's cradle.

386
00:28:23,051 --> 00:28:24,381
I never played it.

387
00:28:25,221 --> 00:28:29,141
OK, Kara Simmons was shot while she was
running. Her phone call tells us that.

388
00:28:29,261 --> 00:28:32,641
She was running towards the back door.
There. She turns.

389
00:28:32,771 --> 00:28:35,651
The shooter sees her.
She's shot high on the chest.

390
00:28:35,771 --> 00:28:39,731
It spins her around, spraying blood
on the walls there and there.

391
00:28:39,861 --> 00:28:41,361
She loses her cellphone.

392
00:28:41,491 --> 00:28:46,411
She struggles to the coffee table, the couch,
and then she finally falls back there.

393
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:53,960
She never got this far.

394
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,670
It's not her blood.

395
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:11,260
Angel, meet our shooter.

396
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:16,270
DNA of Cervantes' flesh
in Ricky Simmons' mouth.

397
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,440
DNA from a rogue drop of blood
we found at the Simmons' house.

398
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,990
Tell me you're sure about this.

399
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,620
100 per cent.

400
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,870
That puts Cervantes at both crime scenes.

401
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:34,750
- Let's nail his coffin and ship it.
- Hang on, Sergeant.

402
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:38,250
We get him to roll over on Guerrero,
and we own them both.

403
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:41,380
You're talking about throwing him a deal? Then
what, he walks?

404
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,760
If he does, we pick him up on other charges.
If he gets us Guerrero, it's win-win.

405
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:50,219
Gets us Guerrero? We can't catch the guy,
he's un-fucking-touchable!

406
00:29:50,349 --> 00:29:53,009
Come on, Lieutenant.
We already got a win.

407
00:29:53,139 --> 00:29:54,769
It's not about your win.

408
00:29:54,889 --> 00:29:57,139
It's about the big picture.

409
00:30:07,819 --> 00:30:09,569
I've seen this before.

410
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:11,659
Whenever a cop is killed,

411
00:30:11,779 --> 00:30:15,699
it's like everyone's life has been stopped
in mid-sentence.

412
00:30:15,829 --> 00:30:19,209
Davey Sanchez was a fearless
and dedicated cop.

413
00:30:20,249 --> 00:30:24,089
Davey Sanchez was a son,
a husband and a father.

414
00:30:25,879 --> 00:30:28,049
Davey Sanchez was my partner.

415
00:30:29,089 --> 00:30:31,089
Davey Sanchez was my hero.

416
00:30:34,469 --> 00:30:36,019
That was great.

417
00:30:40,849 --> 00:30:43,269
What, Dad?

418
00:30:43,399 --> 00:30:47,358
Ever since Davey was killed,
my world feels out of control.

419
00:30:49,358 --> 00:30:50,528
How do you fix it?

420
00:30:53,158 --> 00:30:54,828
Two ways, I guess...

421
00:30:57,908 --> 00:30:59,958
Honor Davey's memory...

422
00:31:02,628 --> 00:31:04,628
and catch the bastard who did this to him.

423
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:08,548
It's not about vengeance.

424
00:31:10,258 --> 00:31:12,338
It's not about retaliation...

425
00:31:13,848 --> 00:31:16,178
or balancing the books.

426
00:31:16,928 --> 00:31:19,678
It's about something deep inside.

427
00:31:23,058 --> 00:31:25,978
My father had more than his share of pain,

428
00:31:26,108 --> 00:31:28,938
but he didn't deal with it
the way most people do.

429
00:31:29,068 --> 00:31:32,068
Happy hour. Now, there's a misnomer.

430
00:31:32,988 --> 00:31:35,618
I'll have what he's having.

431
00:31:35,738 --> 00:31:36,908
Wise choice.

432
00:31:39,658 --> 00:31:40,908
You celebrating?

433
00:31:41,498 --> 00:31:43,168
Something like that.

434
00:31:45,337 --> 00:31:46,997
Hey, have we met?

435
00:31:48,127 --> 00:31:50,457
I doubt it. I just moved down here.

436
00:31:51,547 --> 00:31:53,087
I needed a new start.

437
00:31:54,047 --> 00:31:56,797
- Girlfriend or boyfriend?
- Ex-wife.

438
00:31:56,927 --> 00:31:59,017
She said I drank too much.

439
00:32:00,097 --> 00:32:02,017
Hence the "ex" part.

440
00:32:02,137 --> 00:32:04,437
- Fuck her.
- Man, she was all over me to change,

441
00:32:04,557 --> 00:32:07,477
like she never done anything
wrong in her life...

442
00:32:07,607 --> 00:32:10,687
- besides marrying me.
- We all make mistakes.

443
00:32:10,817 --> 00:32:13,357
Unfortunately, mine usually involve lawyers.

444
00:32:13,487 --> 00:32:16,197
God! Damn it!

445
00:32:16,327 --> 00:32:19,197
I thought I was the only one
who hated the Hurricanes.

446
00:32:19,327 --> 00:32:23,327
- I take it you didn't grow up in Miami.
- No, I've had to move around some.

447
00:32:23,457 --> 00:32:25,167
Say no more.

448
00:32:25,287 --> 00:32:27,627
But home is where my ass is.

449
00:32:28,627 --> 00:32:30,207
I'm getting mine out of town.

450
00:32:30,337 --> 00:32:32,007
Enjoy Miami.

451
00:32:33,257 --> 00:32:36,837
Remember, there's nothing
a new city can't cure.

452
00:32:37,797 --> 00:32:40,557
- You got that right.
- Hey, thanks, buddy.

453
00:32:40,677 --> 00:32:42,347
Next one's on me.

454
00:32:45,146 --> 00:32:48,226
- You sure you're good to drive?
- Been a lot worse.

455
00:33:08,416 --> 00:33:11,206
I sure hope he doesn't go out there
and kill himself.

456
00:33:11,336 --> 00:33:13,416
That would be... tragic.

457
00:33:25,056 --> 00:33:28,726
Matt Chambers is accused
of committing a crime in Florida.

458
00:33:28,856 --> 00:33:32,686
He was arrested in Florida
and he's being tried in Florida.

459
00:33:34,316 --> 00:33:38,606
So the good people of Florida only went as far
as validating their own assumptions

460
00:33:38,736 --> 00:33:41,526
that Matt Chambers is a Florida bad guy.

461
00:34:02,845 --> 00:34:05,015
"Nothing a new city can't cure."

462
00:34:11,685 --> 00:34:16,235
My father taught me one thing
above all others - to be sure.

463
00:34:16,355 --> 00:34:17,605
And I am.

464
00:34:17,735 --> 00:34:20,405
Matt Chambers, Miami is your last stop.

465
00:34:22,405 --> 00:34:25,945
If God is in the details,
and if I believed in God,

466
00:34:26,075 --> 00:34:28,405
then he's in this room with me.

467
00:34:30,285 --> 00:34:33,455
I just wish he'd brought an extension cord.

468
00:34:39,755 --> 00:34:41,084
It's James.

469
00:34:42,464 --> 00:34:45,764
We're gonna get the bastard
who did this to you.

470
00:35:08,494 --> 00:35:12,284
This guy is just toying with us
and LaGuerta's too fucking dumb to see it.

471
00:35:12,414 --> 00:35:16,084
Deb was saying that this psycho guy
cut off that chick's fingertips.

472
00:35:16,204 --> 00:35:19,624
Man, that's got to suck, right?

473
00:35:21,794 --> 00:35:25,424
Guerrero taking home lobsters to boil alive.

474
00:35:26,254 --> 00:35:27,844
That's not his style.

475
00:35:27,964 --> 00:35:31,184
He usually leaves the killing
to someone else.

476
00:35:32,804 --> 00:35:35,514
So, how long have you two been going out?

477
00:35:35,644 --> 00:35:37,394
A couple weeks, I guess.

478
00:35:37,524 --> 00:35:39,813
Deb never mentioned how you met.

479
00:35:39,943 --> 00:35:42,693
Well, she brought her car
into my shop, and...

480
00:35:43,193 --> 00:35:47,323
- You have your own place?
- No, but I wish I did.

481
00:35:54,913 --> 00:35:56,243
Someday, huh?

482
00:35:56,373 --> 00:35:58,293
Dex, enough with the inquisition.

483
00:35:58,413 --> 00:35:59,703
No, it's all right.

484
00:35:59,833 --> 00:36:04,383
If I had a sister with legs like yours, I'd be
checking out the dude she was seeing, too.

485
00:36:04,503 --> 00:36:07,423
Is this guy a keeper or what?

486
00:36:09,843 --> 00:36:11,763
Come on. I'll get you another drink.

487
00:36:11,883 --> 00:36:13,933
Are you guys good?

488
00:36:14,053 --> 00:36:15,433
Yep.

489
00:36:21,183 --> 00:36:23,313
Seems like a nice guy.

490
00:36:23,443 --> 00:36:26,733
They could barely keep
their hands off each other.

491
00:36:26,863 --> 00:36:29,733
I can kill a man, dismember his body,

492
00:36:29,863 --> 00:36:32,533
and be home in time for Letterman.

493
00:36:32,653 --> 00:36:36,373
But knowing what to say
when my girlfriend's feeling insecure...

494
00:36:37,373 --> 00:36:39,082
I'm totally lost.

495
00:36:42,912 --> 00:36:45,422
Off your ass, Cervantes.
Hands behind your back.

496
00:36:45,542 --> 00:36:48,292
Walk backwards and assume the position.

497
00:36:57,392 --> 00:36:58,722
Step away.

498
00:37:05,852 --> 00:37:07,272
Exit the cell.

499
00:37:09,522 --> 00:37:10,982
Where are we going?

500
00:37:11,112 --> 00:37:15,202
The call came down. They want you moved to
a more secure block.

501
00:37:19,452 --> 00:37:23,202
You think the call to take care of me
came down from the warden?

502
00:37:23,332 --> 00:37:26,582
Who the fuck do you think
the warden listens to?

503
00:37:28,252 --> 00:37:29,632
Get used to it.

504
00:37:34,012 --> 00:37:35,972
This is from Mr. Guerrero.

505
00:38:13,341 --> 00:38:19,051
New claims for US unemployment benefits
fell unexpectedly 273,000 last week,

506
00:38:19,181 --> 00:38:23,351
pushing the four-week average claim
to the lowest level in nearly six years.

507
00:38:23,471 --> 00:38:28,731
Initial claims for state jobless aid
fell 11,000 in the week just ended.

508
00:38:34,571 --> 00:38:38,110
Every time a woman
tries to do this to me, it...

509
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,740
tickles.

510
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:43,990
Still, it's not entirely unpleasant.

511
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,160
What?

512
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:47,250
The kids.

513
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:50,210
Oh, they sleep through thunderstorms.

514
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,030
I'm sorry.

515
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:31,250
Tell me.

516
00:39:33,589 --> 00:39:35,089
I can't do this.

517
00:39:37,339 --> 00:39:39,009
That's OK.

518
00:39:40,049 --> 00:39:42,009
That's OK.

519
00:39:43,049 --> 00:39:44,259
I'm OK.

520
00:39:49,269 --> 00:39:52,229
We have an elephant in the room,
and its name is "sex."

521
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:55,309
Tell me about it.

522
00:39:57,069 --> 00:39:59,939
Hey, as far as I'm concerned,
it can just stay in the corner

523
00:40:00,069 --> 00:40:01,779
and mind its own damn business.

524
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:05,409
It's easier said than done.

525
00:40:07,369 --> 00:40:09,039
Yeah.

526
00:40:10,579 --> 00:40:12,079
But it needs to be right...

527
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:15,709
for both of us.

528
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:21,379
Or it won't be right for either of us.

529
00:40:24,009 --> 00:40:25,929
I don't want that. Do you?

530
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:30,099
No.

531
00:40:31,019 --> 00:40:32,678
You know...

532
00:40:35,688 --> 00:40:40,608
I can't believe I found the one good,
truly decent man left on the planet.

533
00:40:43,278 --> 00:40:46,448
...was found dead in a basement hallway
of the Miami Metro jail.

534
00:40:46,868 --> 00:40:51,368
Norberto Cervantes was a known associate
of reputed drug lord Carlos Guerrero.

535
00:40:51,498 --> 00:40:53,498
Speculation is that another inmate

536
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:56,168
is responsible for the mayhem here tonight.

537
00:41:22,278 --> 00:41:24,818
Notice how the skin is gloving
around the joints?

538
00:41:25,658 --> 00:41:29,318
- And that is important because?
- A sure sign of postmortem severance,

539
00:41:29,448 --> 00:41:34,247
meaning the victim was already dead
when she was relieved of her fingertips.

540
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:37,287
Why the different nail polishes?
What is this guy thinking?

541
00:41:37,417 --> 00:41:39,997
He's thinking, "Tag, Dexter, you're it."

542
00:41:40,127 --> 00:41:42,417
I don't know. Do you have an ID?

543
00:41:42,547 --> 00:41:45,877
- Sherry Taylor, another hooker.
- At least he's consistent.

544
00:41:46,007 --> 00:41:47,047
Yeah.

545
00:41:47,177 --> 00:41:51,557
Killing young women that have
to sell their bodies just to survive...

546
00:41:51,677 --> 00:41:53,017
or feed their kids.

547
00:41:54,017 --> 00:41:58,017
My sister puts up a front so the world
won't see how vulnerable she is.

548
00:42:01,107 --> 00:42:05,187
Me, I put up a front so the world won't see
how vulnerable I'm not.

549
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:09,867
I don't care who these fingertips belong to,

550
00:42:09,987 --> 00:42:13,197
only what my new friend
out there is trying to say.

551
00:42:14,197 --> 00:42:15,867
Morgan. The captain wants you.

552
00:42:18,287 --> 00:42:19,707
Her.

553
00:42:38,516 --> 00:42:39,726
You wanted to see me, sir?

554
00:42:39,846 --> 00:42:43,106
Lieutenant LaGuerta has something
she wants to tell you.

555
00:42:43,226 --> 00:42:47,946
Officer Morgan, you've shown
tremendous initiative these last few days.

556
00:42:48,396 --> 00:42:51,316
Because of you, we were able to
track down that ice truck,

557
00:42:51,446 --> 00:42:54,486
and we now have an ID on the latest victim.

558
00:42:55,536 --> 00:42:59,286
The captain believes you should be reassigned
from Vice to Homicide.

559
00:42:59,416 --> 00:43:02,036
And I concur. Congratulations.

560
00:43:02,166 --> 00:43:04,746
You're a good cop, like your old man.

561
00:43:06,126 --> 00:43:07,126
Thank you, sir!

562
00:43:11,716 --> 00:43:15,636
- Thank you so much.
- I see a detective shield in your future.

563
00:43:16,516 --> 00:43:18,596
I won't let you down, sir.

564
00:43:25,016 --> 00:43:26,776
I hope you know what you're doing.

565
00:43:28,065 --> 00:43:29,435
I promoted you, didn't I?

566
00:43:31,155 --> 00:43:33,945
Now find me this ice-truck son of a bitch.

567
00:43:37,945 --> 00:43:39,495
- OK?
- OK.

568
00:44:06,225 --> 00:44:07,515
OK.

569
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,275
Burning the oil?

570
00:44:09,395 --> 00:44:11,065
I clocked out.

571
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:15,775
Why are you going at this so hard?

572
00:44:15,905 --> 00:44:19,235
Someone comes after one of us,
he comes after all of us.

573
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:27,704
I know that look, Maria.
You got something to say, just say it.

574
00:44:27,834 --> 00:44:30,664
I just got off the phone with the hospital.

575
00:44:32,254 --> 00:44:35,294
Kara Simmons suffered
massive heart failure 30 minutes ago.

576
00:44:35,424 --> 00:44:36,964
I got to be there.

577
00:44:38,504 --> 00:44:40,174
James, she died.

578
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:56,024
Was Cervantes right?

579
00:44:58,024 --> 00:45:01,324
Was Kara sleeping with someone
other than Ricky?

580
00:45:04,204 --> 00:45:05,914
Was it you?

581
00:45:10,084 --> 00:45:13,414
- What the fuck were you thinking?
- What the fuck business is it of yours?

582
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:17,084
My cops, my precinct, my business!

583
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:21,174
Kara was gonna ask Ricky for a divorce
as soon as he came off undercover.

584
00:45:21,304 --> 00:45:22,844
She didn't want to...

585
00:45:22,974 --> 00:45:26,093
She didn't want to hurt him
when he was on the case.

586
00:45:29,563 --> 00:45:32,393
If I go by the book,
I take you off the case.

587
00:45:32,523 --> 00:45:33,643
Fuck the book.

588
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:37,103
- There's nobody more motivated to get...
- Revenge?

589
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:39,523
Justice.

590
00:45:48,573 --> 00:45:50,413
Take point on Guerrero.

591
00:45:55,003 --> 00:45:56,463
Thanks.

592
00:45:59,253 --> 00:46:03,343
In slaughterhouses, they stun the animals
before butchering them.

593
00:46:03,463 --> 00:46:05,633
It's the humane thing to do.

594
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:07,883
Those animals...

595
00:46:08,013 --> 00:46:09,683
they're the lucky ones.

596
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:27,322
"Brother, meet me at Loco's Crab Shack.

597
00:46:27,452 --> 00:46:30,412
"Totally important.
Do not let me down. Deb."

598
00:46:31,452 --> 00:46:33,412
Gone to rest his weary head.

599
00:46:33,542 --> 00:46:35,202
The good news is he'll still be here

600
00:46:35,332 --> 00:46:38,292
when I come back for
our own personal happy hour.

601
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,212
God, these are so good.

602
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:45,302
Not as good as your good news.

603
00:46:46,302 --> 00:46:49,892
My little sister's all growed-up
and transferred to Homicide.

604
00:46:53,432 --> 00:46:54,932
And the best part...

605
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:57,562
LaGuerta had to say the actual words.

606
00:46:57,692 --> 00:47:00,732
- I thought her head would explode.
- I'm really proud of you.

607
00:47:00,862 --> 00:47:04,192
You had my back the whole way,
and I appreciate it.

608
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:06,612
I mean that. You're the best.

609
00:47:06,742 --> 00:47:09,612
And that's why I wanted
to share this moment with you.

610
00:47:09,742 --> 00:47:11,322
So, Sean was busy?

611
00:47:13,662 --> 00:47:15,582
It turns out there's another woman.

612
00:47:16,502 --> 00:47:17,502
Who?

613
00:47:18,662 --> 00:47:19,662
Me.

614
00:47:19,792 --> 00:47:21,832
Sean the mechanic is married?

615
00:47:21,961 --> 00:47:25,091
Imagine me picking the wrong guy, huh?

616
00:47:25,211 --> 00:47:26,381
And you and he are...

617
00:47:26,511 --> 00:47:27,551
So over.

618
00:47:27,671 --> 00:47:29,551
I dumped his married ass.

619
00:47:29,681 --> 00:47:33,471
I just wish I could get into
a healthy relationship like you and Rita,

620
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:36,971
without the drama and the tension
and the uncertainty.

621
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:39,641
Yeah, I'm a lucky guy.

622
00:47:56,661 --> 00:47:59,621
Jesus, Dad, it's called being on time!
Did you ever hear of it?

623
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:01,751
I was having a bad day.

624
00:48:01,871 --> 00:48:06,251
- The captain and I had a discussion.
- Well, maybe you sh...

625
00:48:06,381 --> 00:48:08,001
Wait. What kind of bad day?

626
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:13,011
It's about the guy who killed Davey, isn't it?

627
00:48:13,141 --> 00:48:16,351
The judge said the bust wasn't righteous and
let him walk.

628
00:48:17,521 --> 00:48:19,601
Bad guy kills a cop and nothing happens?

629
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:22,640
That's not fair.

630
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:24,400
Life's not fair, Dexter.

631
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:27,360
Can't anyone do anything?

632
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,280
Can't you do something?

633
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,860
No, not now.

634
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,660
So what, then?

635
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:39,910
The world just keeps
spinning out of control?

636
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:43,500
No.

637
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:46,960
The world can always be set right again.

638
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:50,920
Bad guy kills a cop,
and nothing happens?

639
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:53,260
Not anymore.

640
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:54,630
Be back in a sec.

641
00:48:55,640 --> 00:49:00,350
- I'm running the gamut here emotion-wise.
- Nature calls.

642
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:04,020
All the planning, the making sure...

643
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:06,440
does it go away because I have a chance

644
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:11,030
to rid the world of a cop-killer
and balance the books?

645
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:15,030
Do I just ignore everything my father
taught me about how to do this right,

646
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:18,700
about how to stay safe so I can do it again?

647
00:49:27,379 --> 00:49:28,539
Yep.

648
00:49:30,089 --> 00:49:33,049
I don't give a shit
about your goddamn problems.

649
00:49:33,169 --> 00:49:35,799
I gave you a job.
You take care of it.

650
00:49:39,809 --> 00:49:42,059
What the fuck you looking at?

651
00:49:53,489 --> 00:49:55,489
Happy birthday, Alex!

652
00:50:08,499 --> 00:50:10,169
But next year at this time...

653
00:50:10,879 --> 00:50:12,669
It's you.

654
00:50:13,379 --> 00:50:14,629
And you.

655
00:50:16,219 --> 00:50:17,678
Thanks, Dad.

656
00:50:20,758 --> 00:50:22,178
All right, enough corniness.

657
00:50:22,308 --> 00:50:24,268
We meet again...

658
00:50:32,108 --> 00:50:33,528
...for the last time.

659
00:50:36,358 --> 00:50:38,658
I didn't do anyth... anything.

660
00:50:38,778 --> 00:50:40,778
Some people believe that.

661
00:50:43,238 --> 00:50:44,988
The problem is, I don't.

662
00:50:45,788 --> 00:50:48,368
But it's true. I was... I was set up.

663
00:50:51,498 --> 00:50:52,588
By whom?

664
00:50:53,878 --> 00:50:56,048
That... that family.

665
00:50:57,798 --> 00:51:01,138
They needed someone to blame. It's a natural
thing to do when you're grieving.

666
00:51:01,258 --> 00:51:03,008
So then none of this is your fault?

667
00:51:03,138 --> 00:51:04,638
I swear.

668
00:51:05,678 --> 00:51:07,848
OK! OK! OK! No!

669
00:51:07,978 --> 00:51:09,808
OK. OK. Stop.

670
00:51:09,938 --> 00:51:11,598
All right.

671
00:51:11,728 --> 00:51:12,648
OK, OK.

672
00:51:12,768 --> 00:51:13,938
It...

673
00:51:14,068 --> 00:51:15,858
It was me, only it wasn't me.

674
00:51:15,988 --> 00:51:18,187
It was the booze.

675
00:51:18,317 --> 00:51:20,027
It takes me over.

676
00:51:20,157 --> 00:51:23,577
That's a point of view to which
I'm not entirely unsympathetic.

677
00:51:24,577 --> 00:51:30,417
Neither you nor I is in complete control
of our destinies.

678
00:51:31,877 --> 00:51:34,587
Although, at the moment,
it would seem I have the upper hand.

679
00:51:36,417 --> 00:51:38,547
Really, I'm so sorry.

680
00:51:38,667 --> 00:51:41,627
You've done this
too many times to be sorry.

681
00:51:54,767 --> 00:51:57,977
Carlos Guerrero has chosen
to live in a dangerous world.

682
00:51:58,107 --> 00:52:00,147
That's his truth.

683
00:52:00,277 --> 00:52:04,777
My truth is that world doesn't need me
to balance its books.

684
00:52:38,316 --> 00:52:42,316
Matt Chambers, welcome
to your last change of address.

685
00:52:42,446 --> 00:52:44,106
You'll like it here.

686
00:52:44,236 --> 00:52:47,326
You and your neighbors
have so much in common.

687
00:53:14,595 --> 00:53:17,185
The worst thing about
finally putting together a puzzle

688
00:53:17,305 --> 00:53:20,395
is finding there are missing pieces.

689
00:53:27,615 --> 00:53:30,735
He came back and left nothing
behind but a message,

690
00:53:30,865 --> 00:53:32,445
"Come find me."

691
00:53:35,325 --> 00:53:36,995
And I will.

692
00:53:39,545 --> 00:53:41,745
There are no secrets in life...

693
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:46,746
just hidden truths
that lie beneath the surface.
