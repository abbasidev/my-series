1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:03,880
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:06,050
What if the ice-truck
killer does disappear?

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,930
No, he's got unfinished business with me.

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:15,440
"Dear Ken, I'm in pieces.
Why the cold shoulder? Love, Barbie."

5
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,270
Paul called after you left.

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,110
He's already out of jail. Overcrowding.
Can you believe it?

7
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,900
Are you fucking my wife?

8
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:26,280
Next time, we'll figure
out what to tell the kids.

9
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:30,950
- So you don't have to sneak out like this.
- You want there to be a next time?

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,949
I just wish he'd go away. Why can't he
just go away and disappear forever?

11
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:38,079
- I so want to maul you right now.
- I so want you to.

12
00:00:38,209 --> 00:00:40,749
It's different.

13
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,919
It feels like...

14
00:00:45,049 --> 00:00:48,219
I hate saying this.
It sounds fucking cheesy.

15
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:50,599
It feels like making love.

16
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:57,939
"Barbie, be patient.
One day we'll share a cold one."

17
00:03:08,857 --> 00:03:10,437
Thank God for showers.

18
00:03:10,567 --> 00:03:11,857
Private time to think -

19
00:03:11,987 --> 00:03:16,067
harder to come by now that
I'm in a real relationship.

20
00:03:17,527 --> 00:03:19,617
- Do you mind?
- Not at all.

21
00:03:22,707 --> 00:03:25,077
- Could you pass the soap?
- Yeah.

22
00:03:35,047 --> 00:03:36,927
Mom, I got to pee!

23
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,307
I'll be right there, sweetie!

24
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:41,307
- Hold on a second, buddy!
- I can't!

25
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:46,147
- Sorry. One-bathroom house.
- Nature calls.

26
00:03:48,977 --> 00:03:51,317
Cool. How did you get that ugly scar?

27
00:03:51,437 --> 00:03:54,276
- Cody.
- Sword fight. I won.

28
00:03:56,816 --> 00:04:00,116
- Mom, I got to brush.
- Whatever happened to knocking?

29
00:04:00,236 --> 00:04:01,656
I'm gonna be late for school.

30
00:04:01,786 --> 00:04:03,996
You brush, you pee, I'm just gonna...

31
00:04:06,536 --> 00:04:07,996
Wow, big scar.

32
00:04:08,126 --> 00:04:10,666
Sword fight. He won.

33
00:04:16,886 --> 00:04:19,006
I mean, what does separation mean to you?

34
00:04:19,136 --> 00:04:22,466
To me is that you're separated,
And you work it out.

35
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,476
Now, this was false pretences.

36
00:04:24,726 --> 00:04:28,306
Nina knew she wanted a divorce when
she asked for the separation. She lied.

37
00:04:28,436 --> 00:04:30,226
And you didn't when you
were cheating on her, right?

38
00:04:30,356 --> 00:04:32,016
"Cheat". One cheat.

39
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:34,026
- That's in the singular.
- One. OK.

40
00:04:34,146 --> 00:04:36,486
And I felt so crappy, I told her the next day.

41
00:04:36,606 --> 00:04:39,776
- Your problem is you're too honest.
- She wouldn't even talk about it.

42
00:04:39,906 --> 00:04:42,366
And I tried to get her to see
a counselor with me.

43
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,996
Stop the car, man! Stop the goddamn car!

44
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:48,826
Hey!

45
00:05:04,845 --> 00:05:05,885
Stop! Police!

46
00:05:35,205 --> 00:05:36,205
- You all right?
- Yeah.

47
00:06:12,074 --> 00:06:15,744
The suspect's name was Jacques Bayard,
according to his driver's license.

48
00:06:15,874 --> 00:06:18,704
- Haitian?
- That'd be my guess.

49
00:06:18,834 --> 00:06:20,794
All right. Let's go over it again.

50
00:06:20,924 --> 00:06:22,884
I saw a gun in the suspect's waistband.

51
00:06:23,004 --> 00:06:25,634
I went to question him,
and he took off running.

52
00:06:25,754 --> 00:06:29,724
- Angel, you saw all this.
- Yeah, I saw Bayard bolt,

53
00:06:29,844 --> 00:06:31,684
and I turned the car around in pursuit.

54
00:06:31,804 --> 00:06:35,304
- And when you went under the causeway...
- He took a shot at me.

55
00:06:35,434 --> 00:06:39,354
I took cover and returned fire from that corner.

56
00:06:39,484 --> 00:06:41,644
No, not from there.

57
00:06:41,774 --> 00:06:43,064
Yes, from fucking there.

58
00:06:44,274 --> 00:06:45,274
But...

59
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:51,654
if you shot him from right there,
the blood spatter would go in that direction.

60
00:06:51,784 --> 00:06:54,124
You questioning me?
I got questions for you.

61
00:06:54,244 --> 00:06:57,204
- The man's doing what he's supposed to.
- He is a creep job!

62
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,874
Just focus on the facts, OK?

63
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:02,044
The DA's team is ready for you. You good?

64
00:07:02,174 --> 00:07:05,844
- I'm good.
- Yeah.

65
00:07:05,964 --> 00:07:06,964
You're up next.

66
00:07:12,843 --> 00:07:14,683
Sorry, but I didn't invent physics.

67
00:07:14,803 --> 00:07:16,223
He just got mixed up, is all.

68
00:07:17,143 --> 00:07:19,433
I'm not even sure what the hell happened.

69
00:07:19,983 --> 00:07:21,853
Trauma can distort the memory.

70
00:07:37,163 --> 00:07:39,123
I want you and Rita to meet my boyfriend.

71
00:07:39,243 --> 00:07:42,413
- It's hard to get a baby-sitter on Friday night.
- You're my brother.

72
00:07:42,543 --> 00:07:46,383
- You should know my boyfriend.
- You really like using the B word.

73
00:07:46,503 --> 00:07:49,713
Rudy is my goddamn boyfriend,
so stop making bullshit excuses.

74
00:07:49,843 --> 00:07:53,223
Honestly, our last double date
was a little awkward.

75
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:56,553
I just want to make sure this one's gonna stick.

76
00:07:56,683 --> 00:07:59,223
Well, thanks for the vote
of fucking confidence.

77
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:01,893
Dex, Rudy's different.

78
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:06,233
I feel safe with him. I think... I'm falling for him.

79
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:09,113
Excuse me.
Where can I find Dexter Morgan?

80
00:08:09,233 --> 00:08:13,033
- Right here.
- Oh, that was easy.

81
00:08:14,742 --> 00:08:17,822
An urgent registered letter?
Maybe you won a sweepstakes.

82
00:08:17,952 --> 00:08:21,662
- Dex, you got a second?
- Yeah.

83
00:08:25,502 --> 00:08:27,542
You finish your report on the shooting?

84
00:08:27,672 --> 00:08:29,502
I'm walking it up to IA right now.

85
00:08:29,632 --> 00:08:32,302
You still think Doakes' version doesn't add up?

86
00:08:32,422 --> 00:08:34,552
Blood never lies.

87
00:08:35,592 --> 00:08:39,092
Shit. Listen, um...

88
00:08:39,222 --> 00:08:42,892
- Can you sit on that till I talk to Doakes?
- Here.

89
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:46,232
No, it's yours to sit on, stand on.
Do what you want.

90
00:08:47,192 --> 00:08:48,902
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

91
00:08:51,692 --> 00:08:53,782
It's a federal of fence to read
someone else's mail.

92
00:08:53,902 --> 00:08:56,742
"We regret to inform you
of the death of your father"?

93
00:08:58,242 --> 00:09:01,412
- Dad died ten years ago.
- This isn't about Harry.

94
00:09:01,532 --> 00:09:06,162
"Joseph Driscoll of Dade City, Florida,
names his son, Dexter Morgan of Miami,

95
00:09:06,292 --> 00:09:09,122
"as his executor." It's a will.

96
00:09:09,252 --> 00:09:12,462
He can't be your biological father. Dad said
he died before you came to live with us,

97
00:09:12,592 --> 00:09:13,802
he wouldn't make a mistake like that.

98
00:09:14,422 --> 00:09:17,802
"The body's awaiting cremation
while they notify the next of kin."

99
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:21,101
Hey, I'm your only next of kin.
Don't you fucking forget it.

100
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:25,981
Oh, and I inherited a house.

101
00:09:27,061 --> 00:09:29,811
I know the truth, because Harry
always told me the truth.

102
00:09:29,941 --> 00:09:33,521
He had to.
He was teaching me principles, a code.

103
00:09:33,651 --> 00:09:35,691
He knew what I would become without it.

104
00:09:35,821 --> 00:09:39,151
So Joseph Driscoll of Dade City
must have been mistaken.

105
00:09:40,571 --> 00:09:41,741
You know what this is?

106
00:09:42,951 --> 00:09:45,831
This is Dexter's new birth certificate.

107
00:09:45,951 --> 00:09:49,001
The adoption finally went through.

108
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:52,041
- You're a Morgan now.
- I thought I was already a Morgan.

109
00:09:52,171 --> 00:09:54,801
Well, you have been to us,
but it's official now.

110
00:09:57,301 --> 00:09:59,431
It took a long time and a lot of hurdles.

111
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:02,971
- This is an important day for us.
- Hey, Dad?

112
00:10:03,101 --> 00:10:06,971
How come you never told us
what happened to Dexter's real parents?

113
00:10:07,101 --> 00:10:08,731
Well, they died.

114
00:10:08,851 --> 00:10:11,651
- I know, but how?
- I don't know.

115
00:10:11,771 --> 00:10:14,981
- Let's not talk about it.
- No, how did they die, Dad?

116
00:10:16,071 --> 00:10:19,321
It was an accident, a tragic accident.

117
00:10:21,991 --> 00:10:25,910
So, have you found out anything else
about this Joe Driscoll?

118
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,660
Well, I looked online.
I even looked at police records.

119
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:34,630
There are no birth records, no driver's license,
just the deed to the house.

120
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:38,510
And a mention in the local paper
about his bowling team.

121
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:42,180
- That's odd.
- Yeah, I spoke to the probate lawyer,

122
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,720
the guy who drafted the will,
and apparently Joseph Driscoll

123
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,560
was an insurance adjuster of sound mind,

124
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,440
with no doubts about who I was.

125
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,440
You're not feeling any of this, are you?

126
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,950
You're obviously so overwhelmed
that you've shut down.

127
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,040
Maybe.

128
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:14,420
- It's too much for you to handle.
- Yeah. I guess.

129
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:19,420
- So I think I should come with you.
- Oh, no, you don't have to do that.

130
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:22,130
Trust me. You'll need me.

131
00:11:53,869 --> 00:11:56,749
Did I fall asleep?

132
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,169
Sex like that takes a lot out of a person.

133
00:12:09,259 --> 00:12:11,519
Are we still seeing your brother
Friday night?

134
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:14,059
No. He's got to go to Dade City.

135
00:12:15,439 --> 00:12:20,229
- What's in Dade City?
- I told you he was adopted, right?

136
00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:23,989
Some dead guy in Dade fucking City
thought he was his biological father

137
00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:27,949
- and left him a house.
- Really?

138
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:40,748
- It's a mistake, a big one.
- Still, though, that's got to...

139
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:45,298
Open up some old wounds.

140
00:12:47,138 --> 00:12:50,678
- When are you leaving?
- Me?

141
00:12:50,808 --> 00:12:52,928
I'm staying in bed with you all weekend.

142
00:12:54,348 --> 00:12:58,848
- I thought you two were close.
- We are.

143
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:02,188
Dex likes to deal with things on his own.
He doesn't need my help.

144
00:13:02,318 --> 00:13:03,478
Or...

145
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:08,658
He doesn't know how to ask for it.

146
00:13:17,038 --> 00:13:19,788
I left a message not to have
this conversation.

147
00:13:19,918 --> 00:13:21,918
Yeah, which is why I hustled over here,

148
00:13:22,048 --> 00:13:27,048
- so we could hash this out like adults.
- I'm an adult but I'm still going out of town.

149
00:13:27,178 --> 00:13:30,888
Not if it means blowing off
my scheduled visit with my kids.

150
00:13:31,008 --> 00:13:33,848
That's not your call.
The kids are already at Colleen's.

151
00:13:33,968 --> 00:13:36,768
You can have your visit when we get back.

152
00:13:43,777 --> 00:13:47,187
It's just that I already laid out cash
for the tickets.

153
00:13:48,777 --> 00:13:50,907
A death in the family trumps the circus.

154
00:13:51,027 --> 00:13:52,697
Dexter is not your family. I am.

155
00:13:56,787 --> 00:13:57,787
You ready?

156
00:14:00,377 --> 00:14:02,327
Hey, Paul. Better hit the road.

157
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:40,867
They should serve a cardiologist
with these burgers.

158
00:14:40,997 --> 00:14:45,587
We had to eat them.
Junk food's the unwritten rule of the road.

159
00:14:45,707 --> 00:14:46,747
It's nice.

160
00:14:48,376 --> 00:14:51,256
The lawyer said there should be
a key under the mat.

161
00:14:55,466 --> 00:14:59,346
- Are you my new neighbors?
- No.

162
00:14:59,476 --> 00:15:02,136
We're just here to clear up
some things with the estate.

163
00:15:02,266 --> 00:15:04,936
So sad about Mr. Driscoll.

164
00:15:05,056 --> 00:15:08,316
He was only 60, you know -
too young for a heart attack.

165
00:15:08,436 --> 00:15:13,276
He used to clean my gutters every fall.
I don't know what I'm gonna do now...

166
00:15:14,816 --> 00:15:17,446
Unless you know how to clean gutters.

167
00:15:18,656 --> 00:15:22,956
We're not gonna be here for that long.
But you have a good day.

168
00:15:42,056 --> 00:15:44,646
A bachelor lived here, that's for sure.

169
00:15:48,566 --> 00:15:52,986
We can head back tomorrow morning,
as soon I straighten things out at the morgue.

170
00:15:53,106 --> 00:15:55,565
I don't want a house in Dade City.

171
00:15:55,695 --> 00:15:57,945
Which means it's gonna need to be packed up.

172
00:15:58,075 --> 00:16:02,825
And I don't think anybody else is gonna do it,
so I guess that leaves us.

173
00:16:05,495 --> 00:16:06,875
Told you you'd need me.

174
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:36,065
- Hey, James.
- Hey, man.

175
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:39,065
IA is pressing me
on my report of the shooting.

176
00:16:39,195 --> 00:16:43,115
- Yeah.
- There's one thing that I can't get clear on.

177
00:16:43,245 --> 00:16:46,285
- It's pretty clear from where I was standing.
- Yeah...

178
00:16:47,665 --> 00:16:53,125
Except I could have sworn that I heard
your 9mm go off before the .38.

179
00:16:53,255 --> 00:16:56,795
Now, there's lots of reasons
it could have gone down that way.

180
00:16:56,925 --> 00:17:01,004
If Bayard even just aimed at you,
it's still all right to shoot.

181
00:17:01,134 --> 00:17:03,804
- Except he shot first.
- Maybe you're confused about that, too.

182
00:17:03,924 --> 00:17:07,184
But the blood-spatter report says
it couldn't have gone that way.

183
00:17:07,304 --> 00:17:11,394
- You saying I'm a liar?
- I'm saying maybe you're not remembering.

184
00:17:11,514 --> 00:17:16,184
This may come as a shock to you, Angel,
but you're not the only honest cop in Miami.

185
00:17:18,524 --> 00:17:21,614
Look, I just want to know
why a man is dead.

186
00:17:21,734 --> 00:17:26,614
- You want to come at me, you do it straight.
- You want it straight? I did not see a gun.

187
00:17:27,994 --> 00:17:30,914
Angel. I need to talk to you.

188
00:17:32,914 --> 00:17:33,914
Help me out, man.

189
00:17:49,264 --> 00:17:51,894
- Is that Joe?
- Must be.

190
00:17:55,564 --> 00:18:01,354
It's weird, but he looks a little bit like you...
But not really.

191
00:18:01,484 --> 00:18:04,863
Those seem to be the only pictures
in the house. There's no...

192
00:18:06,193 --> 00:18:08,453
family or kids' photos.

193
00:18:09,663 --> 00:18:10,663
Lonely.

194
00:18:19,753 --> 00:18:20,833
Dexter.

195
00:18:20,963 --> 00:18:22,713
- Hi.
- Hey.

196
00:18:22,843 --> 00:18:26,343
Surprise.

197
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:31,593
I know you can't ask for my help,
but it's my duty to,

198
00:18:31,723 --> 00:18:33,183
you know...

199
00:18:33,303 --> 00:18:37,773
help while you deal with old wounds.

200
00:18:37,893 --> 00:18:40,193
Or wha...
Jesus. Whatever. I'm here.

201
00:18:40,313 --> 00:18:44,063
- So it appears.
- And this is Rudy.

202
00:18:44,983 --> 00:18:46,483
Hey.

203
00:18:48,743 --> 00:18:50,743
I've waited a long time to meet you.

204
00:18:52,493 --> 00:18:55,203
And you must be Rita.

205
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,373
- Hi.
- Hi.

206
00:18:57,503 --> 00:19:02,673
He came here for me - for the both of us.
Isn't he great?

207
00:19:11,682 --> 00:19:13,392
A lot of work to pack all this up.

208
00:19:13,512 --> 00:19:16,562
Even with the four of us,
it'll take us the whole weekend.

209
00:19:16,682 --> 00:19:18,892
- The weekend?
- Where should I put our stuff?

210
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:24,272
It's too eerie,
sleeping in a dead man's house.

211
00:19:24,402 --> 00:19:25,812
I saw a Motel 6 on the way in.

212
00:19:25,942 --> 00:19:27,982
We could stay here and save the money.

213
00:19:28,402 --> 00:19:29,442
I mean, it is late,

214
00:19:29,572 --> 00:19:32,362
and we'd probably get more
packing done if we stayed here.

215
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:35,492
It's up to you, Dex. Just say the word.

216
00:19:38,622 --> 00:19:40,542
As long as you don't mind the sofa bed.

217
00:19:42,042 --> 00:19:44,542
OK, I'll go look for some clean sheets.

218
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:55,182
How did a death
turn into a couples' weekend?

219
00:20:01,732 --> 00:20:04,562
Luckily, I get up earlier than normal people.

220
00:20:05,192 --> 00:20:06,192
Coffee?

221
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:12,242
Thanks. I've got to hit the morgue.

222
00:20:15,662 --> 00:20:17,741
Want company?

223
00:20:18,621 --> 00:20:19,951
No.

224
00:20:21,001 --> 00:20:23,081
- Thank you, though.
- It's private.

225
00:20:24,711 --> 00:20:25,921
I get it.

226
00:20:36,341 --> 00:20:38,801
I gave Joe a physical once a year,
like clockwork,

227
00:20:38,931 --> 00:20:41,641
so no history of heart disease, but it happens.

228
00:20:41,771 --> 00:20:42,851
It appears so.

229
00:20:42,981 --> 00:20:45,811
We were about to send him
to a crematorium when we found you.

230
00:20:45,941 --> 00:20:50,941
We thought his son should have a chance
to pay his last respects.

231
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,941
I'm not his son.

232
00:20:53,361 --> 00:20:56,111
Estrangement in a family is a shame, but...

233
00:20:56,861 --> 00:20:59,281
death is the great unifier.

234
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:39,820
That's an interesting tattoo.

235
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:44,950
Joe said he picked that up in Nam.
You can be proud. He was a patriot.

236
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:49,040
- Perhaps he was also an ex-convict.
- Excuse me?

237
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,790
It's a prison tattoo,
it's a pen and ballpoint ink one.

238
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,090
It's three or four decades old,
judging by the fade.

239
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,590
Son, I knew Joe. He was no ex-convict.

240
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:04,850
He was a good man, a quiet man,
and a damn good bowler.

241
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:11,650
How'd you determine cardiac arrest?
Was there damage to the coronary artery?

242
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:14,610
It's professional curiosity.

243
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:18,740
- I work in forensics, down in Miami.
- I see.

244
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:23,320
Well, I found micro aneurisms in the retinas.

245
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:26,410
It's common with seizures
during a heart attack.

246
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:30,539
It's also a sign of diabetic retinopathy.

247
00:22:30,669 --> 00:22:34,749
Son, I may be a small-town doctor,
but I know a heart attack when I see one.

248
00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:38,549
Who knows what caused it?

249
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:41,719
Stress, inactivity...

250
00:22:43,049 --> 00:22:44,049
French fries.

251
00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:48,599
But knowing won't bring him back.

252
00:23:01,529 --> 00:23:05,239
It's hard to accept so many unanswered
questions, but sometimes...

253
00:23:05,989 --> 00:23:07,579
No, you're right...

254
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:10,409
Dr. Pittman.

255
00:23:11,829 --> 00:23:15,629
Yeah, this is really hard.

256
00:23:15,749 --> 00:23:20,799
You mind if I just take
a minute alone with... Dad?

257
00:23:22,259 --> 00:23:23,799
I'll be next door in my office.

258
00:23:52,958 --> 00:23:53,828
Masuka.

259
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:55,628
Hey, it's Dexter Morgan.

260
00:23:56,038 --> 00:24:00,668
- Dude, I know your last name.
- I need a favor, a DNA comparison.

261
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:02,968
I thought you were away with the girlfriend.

262
00:24:03,088 --> 00:24:07,848
- What? She surfing the crimson wave?
- I'm just helping out a local agency.

263
00:24:07,968 --> 00:24:11,718
I'm gonna send you two blood samples.
I need it ASAP.

264
00:24:11,848 --> 00:24:14,848
- Do a tox screen, will you?
- Hey, Romeo,

265
00:24:14,978 --> 00:24:19,108
if this is your idea of a romantic weekend,
you will be a bachelor for a long time.

266
00:24:29,618 --> 00:24:32,198
Run another IV.
Let's keep his blood levels volumized.

267
00:24:32,328 --> 00:24:35,038
- What's his pressure?
- It's 80 and dropping.

268
00:24:35,618 --> 00:24:36,998
We may need to do a belly tap.

269
00:24:37,918 --> 00:24:40,087
Hey, Dex. Buddy, I'm here.

270
00:24:40,207 --> 00:24:42,207
- It hurts, Dad.
- What happened?

271
00:24:42,717 --> 00:24:45,047
He tried to climb a fence
to get Debra's ball,

272
00:24:45,177 --> 00:24:48,717
but a dog chased after him,
and he fell on a wrought-iron post.

273
00:24:48,847 --> 00:24:51,807
- Is he gonna be all right?
- We can keep him stable for a while.

274
00:24:51,927 --> 00:24:55,937
But he's gonna need surgery to repair some
internal bleeding. That's a problem.

275
00:24:56,057 --> 00:24:59,147
Can we talk over here, please?
Dex, I'll be right back.

276
00:24:59,267 --> 00:25:01,567
Hold your brother's hand, sweetie.

277
00:25:02,857 --> 00:25:05,447
OK, the complication is
with your son's blood type.

278
00:25:05,567 --> 00:25:08,777
- I don't want to talk about this.
- Why are you being like this?

279
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:10,947
Don't mention that in front of anybody.

280
00:25:11,077 --> 00:25:15,367
Are you crazy? He could die.
You've got to go now.

281
00:25:19,917 --> 00:25:23,207
So, you heard the .38 go off before
Sergeant Doakes' 9mm.

282
00:25:23,337 --> 00:25:26,087
Then I went under the causeway,
and I saw the suspect...

283
00:25:26,217 --> 00:25:30,547
- Mr. Bayard.
- ..Mr. Bayard on the ground,

284
00:25:30,677 --> 00:25:34,267
- his gun lying next to him.
- And you're sure it was Mr. Bayard's gun?

285
00:25:34,387 --> 00:25:38,807
Well, the .38 wasn't mine... and
Sergeant Doakes had his niner in his hands.

286
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:42,107
Did you see Mr. Bayard carrying the gun
before the foot chase began?

287
00:25:42,227 --> 00:25:44,606
Sergeant Doakes did.

288
00:25:44,736 --> 00:25:47,486
Did you see Mr. Bayard acting suspiciously?

289
00:25:48,606 --> 00:25:53,946
- Did you know Mr. Bayard was a janitor?
- I... How the fuck would I know that?

290
00:25:54,076 --> 00:25:58,076
Never got even a parking ticket since
he immigrated from Haiti 15 years ago.

291
00:26:01,536 --> 00:26:05,046
He got a lot more than that this time,
didn't he?

292
00:26:10,756 --> 00:26:16,346
Are you sure you heard the .38 go off
before Sergeant Doakes' 9mm?

293
00:26:25,436 --> 00:26:28,186
Joe bought this house outright in 1976.

294
00:26:28,316 --> 00:26:34,946
- Paid cash, no records before that.
- No records, no childhood photos...

295
00:26:35,366 --> 00:26:38,786
The guy was 60,
but it's like his life started when he was 30.

296
00:26:39,246 --> 00:26:42,536
- You know, you're right. He's right.
- So, what happened

297
00:26:42,666 --> 00:26:44,456
between years one and 29?

298
00:26:44,586 --> 00:26:47,666
- Maybe he butchered his entire family.
- Yeah,

299
00:26:47,796 --> 00:26:51,875
or he walked out on his two wives
and a lot of bad debt.

300
00:26:52,005 --> 00:26:55,675
The guy was a loser, after all.
Who else owns this many bowling balls?

301
00:26:55,805 --> 00:27:02,225
- What do you think, Dex?
- I think Joe spent some time in prison,

302
00:27:02,345 --> 00:27:06,225
probably mixed with some bad people.
Maybe he had to hide from them.

303
00:27:06,355 --> 00:27:10,695
Whatever it was, drugs were involved.
Narcotics anonymous.

304
00:27:10,815 --> 00:27:15,025
Paul used to get these, except he never
made it past the welcome chip.

305
00:27:15,155 --> 00:27:18,865
- Looks like Joe was clean for...
- Let me guess - 30 years.

306
00:27:18,995 --> 00:27:21,495
Joe said no to the drugs,
but not his rock 'n' roll.

307
00:27:21,615 --> 00:27:25,915
Nothing in his collection post-1980.
Got to love a purist.

308
00:27:44,145 --> 00:27:45,645
Oh, good. Dancing.

309
00:28:38,234 --> 00:28:41,234
- Hello?
- Hey, babe. It's Paul.

310
00:28:43,824 --> 00:28:45,824
Just making sure dear Dexter

311
00:28:45,954 --> 00:28:50,544
is dealing decently with his dead dad.

312
00:28:51,794 --> 00:28:54,294
We're fine. Everyone's fine, all right?

313
00:28:54,424 --> 00:28:57,044
- We'll see you on Monday.
- No, no, no.

314
00:28:57,174 --> 00:29:01,343
Talk to me. You having fun? 'Cause I'm not.

315
00:29:01,463 --> 00:29:04,633
- Paul.
- I would have.

316
00:29:04,763 --> 00:29:09,143
I could have taken my kids to the circus.

317
00:29:09,263 --> 00:29:12,933
We'd be eating peanuts right now,
stepping in elephant shit.

318
00:29:13,353 --> 00:29:15,643
Paul, this's not helping my confidence in you.

319
00:29:15,773 --> 00:29:19,363
Oh, I think you've got enough
confidence for both of us.

320
00:29:19,483 --> 00:29:22,613
Look, if you want to work towards
building more visitation days,

321
00:29:22,733 --> 00:29:25,113
you need to avoid this behavior right here.

322
00:29:29,953 --> 00:29:34,873
Now, I think you might just want
to politely hang up.

323
00:29:38,923 --> 00:29:42,463
OK. You're right.

324
00:29:43,633 --> 00:29:46,093
I'm sorry.

325
00:29:46,223 --> 00:29:48,473
You have a great weekend.

326
00:29:59,233 --> 00:30:03,523
A secret life - the only thing
Joe and I have in common.

327
00:30:04,323 --> 00:30:07,402
There's nothing else
in this house to connect us.

328
00:30:07,532 --> 00:30:09,822
Hiding out?

329
00:30:11,492 --> 00:30:12,622
Cleaning up.

330
00:30:16,502 --> 00:30:19,872
I can only imagine what you're going through.

331
00:30:20,002 --> 00:30:22,592
A lot of lemon-fresh joy.

332
00:30:22,712 --> 00:30:25,842
You joke. It's a good defense, by the way.

333
00:30:25,962 --> 00:30:27,052
Thank you, I think.

334
00:30:27,972 --> 00:30:31,552
Still, the possibility has
got to be weighing on you.

335
00:30:31,682 --> 00:30:36,812
- What possibility?
- That Joe could actually be your dad.

336
00:30:36,932 --> 00:30:40,102
The only way that's a possibility
is if Harry was wrong.

337
00:30:40,232 --> 00:30:46,692
- And that's just not possible.
- Or he lied.

338
00:30:48,952 --> 00:30:51,912
Don't you worry, little man.
You're not gonna feel a thing.

339
00:30:52,032 --> 00:30:54,532
I thought there was a problem,
you know, the blood?

340
00:30:54,662 --> 00:30:55,832
Your dad fixed it.

341
00:30:55,952 --> 00:30:59,542
See, you have a very special
blood type - AB negative.

342
00:30:59,672 --> 00:31:02,002
It's hard to come by,
and our supply was low.

343
00:31:02,132 --> 00:31:05,422
But your dad knew somebody
with blood like yours. You're lucky.

344
00:31:05,552 --> 00:31:08,342
- Can I have a moment with my son?
- Yeah.

345
00:31:08,472 --> 00:31:12,841
Hey, Dex. Everything's gonna be fine.
You'll be good as new.

346
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:17,561
- I will?
- Hey, would I lie to you?

347
00:31:21,231 --> 00:31:25,771
When my father was dying,
he just asked me for one thing.

348
00:31:32,361 --> 00:31:33,781
"Be an honest man."

349
00:31:37,831 --> 00:31:39,541
That's all he asked.

350
00:31:41,791 --> 00:31:46,041
I made him that promise,
and that's why I'm a cop.

351
00:31:50,091 --> 00:31:52,761
Now this Haitian man is dead,

352
00:31:52,881 --> 00:31:55,641
and I don't know why.

353
00:31:55,761 --> 00:31:57,561
But I know it ain't right.

354
00:32:01,101 --> 00:32:02,231
But if I talk...

355
00:32:03,311 --> 00:32:06,111
I'll be a rat to the whole precinct.

356
00:32:07,481 --> 00:32:10,111
- But if I lie...
- Hold on.

357
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:22,120
Go ahead.

358
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,970
The blood spatter
doesn't match Doakes' report.

359
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:45,520
Also...

360
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:53,650
...I heard Doakes' 9mm go off before the .38.

361
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:57,200
- But he must have had good cause.
- So Doakes fired first.

362
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,330
Doakes fired first.

363
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:20,600
- I hope tuna's all right.
- Love me a little mercury.

364
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:25,229
- It's Dexter's.
- He's out stealing garbage space...

365
00:33:25,349 --> 00:33:28,059
- from the neighbors.
- Criminal - I like it.

366
00:33:28,189 --> 00:33:30,399
It's the station.

367
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:31,519
Morgan here.

368
00:33:33,399 --> 00:33:37,279
Wait. Did I call the hot Morgan by mistake?

369
00:33:37,409 --> 00:33:41,579
Freudian.
My subconscious has been exposed.

370
00:33:41,699 --> 00:33:44,829
- Well, zip it up and tell me what's going on.
- I got the results.

371
00:33:44,959 --> 00:33:46,619
On Doakes' shooting? Is he cleared?

372
00:33:46,749 --> 00:33:50,879
- On the DNA test.
- What DNA test?

373
00:34:11,229 --> 00:34:14,189
You trusted Dad your entire life,
so why question him now?

374
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:22,239
- Am I missing something?
- DNA test?

375
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:25,659
Masuka called?

376
00:34:25,789 --> 00:34:30,458
Your biological father was dead.
Dad told us that. I remember.

377
00:34:30,578 --> 00:34:32,418
So, the DNA came back negative?

378
00:34:35,418 --> 00:34:38,298
It was a match.

379
00:34:38,428 --> 00:34:40,628
Joe Driscoll was your bio dad.

380
00:34:53,148 --> 00:34:54,148
Interesting.

381
00:34:56,818 --> 00:35:00,448
Do you think Dad... lied?

382
00:35:02,198 --> 00:35:04,828
I think he might have known Joe was here...

383
00:35:06,328 --> 00:35:08,788
five hours up I-95 my whole life.

384
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:11,288
He must have had a damn good reason.

385
00:35:12,498 --> 00:35:15,918
I'm not gonna let some guy you
didn't even know draw him into question.

386
00:35:16,048 --> 00:35:18,088
Deb, I'm not questioning anything.

387
00:35:19,088 --> 00:35:21,968
That's why you got a tox screen, too.

388
00:35:27,178 --> 00:35:28,388
I need to clear my head.

389
00:35:31,018 --> 00:35:32,308
Where are your car keys?

390
00:35:37,567 --> 00:35:41,147
I ordered the tox screen because
Joe had no history of heart disease.

391
00:35:41,277 --> 00:35:45,447
- And the coroner's report was inept.
- You did it because he's important to you.

392
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:48,787
- It was professional curiosity.
- So you'll be professionally glad

393
00:35:48,907 --> 00:35:51,867
to know that the only toxin
in his system was a sedative,

394
00:35:51,997 --> 00:35:53,707
which he probably took to...

395
00:35:53,827 --> 00:35:58,337
- I don't know, sleep.
- That would surprise me.

396
00:35:58,457 --> 00:36:00,087
Joe was 30 years sober,

397
00:36:00,217 --> 00:36:05,887
and I haven't found anything
stronger than Advil in his medicine cabinet.

398
00:36:06,007 --> 00:36:08,757
It wouldn't be
the first addict falling off the wagon.

399
00:36:08,887 --> 00:36:10,637
Or someone slipped him the sedative

400
00:36:10,767 --> 00:36:13,517
so he wouldn't struggle
once injected with something.

401
00:36:14,057 --> 00:36:16,517
- Like?
- Diabetic insulin.

402
00:36:17,517 --> 00:36:20,067
It can cause cardiac arrest.
We've seen it before.

403
00:36:20,187 --> 00:36:24,357
It's nearly impossible to detect unless
you find a point of injection.

404
00:36:24,487 --> 00:36:27,617
- But if I had a chance to examine the body...
- Jesus Christ!

405
00:36:27,737 --> 00:36:30,947
He's not even your family.

406
00:36:31,077 --> 00:36:34,537
Mom and Dad were. I am.

407
00:36:37,457 --> 00:36:41,916
- Will you start questioning me now?
- You? Why would I...

408
00:36:42,046 --> 00:36:44,586
Joe Driscoll was
obviously bad fucking news,

409
00:36:44,716 --> 00:36:47,636
which is why Dad didn't want you
to know anything about him!

410
00:36:47,756 --> 00:36:49,556
Doesn't that matter to you?

411
00:36:53,016 --> 00:36:55,016
I don't know what you want from me.

412
00:37:01,436 --> 00:37:05,736
I want what Dad wanted.
I want nothing to do with this guy.

413
00:37:07,026 --> 00:37:11,946
Let's just finish packing up
this crappy house and walk the fuck away!

414
00:37:12,076 --> 00:37:14,366
All right. That sounds like a good plan. OK?

415
00:37:31,386 --> 00:37:33,426
I guess I understand why Deb is upset.

416
00:37:33,556 --> 00:37:37,806
We both idolized Harry,
lived by what he taught us...

417
00:37:37,936 --> 00:37:41,146
Though Deb never had
to be taught not to kill innocent people.

418
00:37:44,436 --> 00:37:47,275
That's why she doesn't understand
why I need to know.

419
00:37:52,615 --> 00:37:54,945
Howdy, neighbor. Let me get that for you.

420
00:37:55,075 --> 00:37:57,115
Oh. Well, thank you.

421
00:37:58,115 --> 00:38:01,665
I was wondering, did you notice any visitors
over at Joe's last week?

422
00:38:02,335 --> 00:38:05,045
Visitors? Oh, I'm not sure.

423
00:38:05,165 --> 00:38:08,715
I'm just wondering
if he has any outstanding bills.

424
00:38:08,835 --> 00:38:12,925
A gardener, maybe,
or a delivery person, repairman?

425
00:38:13,055 --> 00:38:17,805
Well, come to think of it,
there was a cable repairman here last week.

426
00:38:18,225 --> 00:38:19,895
He was polite.

427
00:38:20,015 --> 00:38:23,065
But, you know,
he couldn't fix my TV antenna.

428
00:38:23,185 --> 00:38:24,475
You remember what he looked like?

429
00:38:27,395 --> 00:38:30,525
Well, he had dark hair...

430
00:38:30,655 --> 00:38:34,535
average height, normal, I suppose.

431
00:38:38,325 --> 00:38:41,535
I did some checking
on our suspect Jacques Bayard.

432
00:38:41,665 --> 00:38:43,455
You lending IA a hand?

433
00:38:43,585 --> 00:38:46,085
I just like to know what's
going on in my department.

434
00:38:46,205 --> 00:38:48,545
And what is going on?

435
00:38:49,085 --> 00:38:52,964
Turns out Mr. Bayard changed
his name when he immigrated here.

436
00:38:53,094 --> 00:38:55,094
Used to be Rene Thibault,

437
00:38:55,214 --> 00:38:58,344
a former officer in the Haitian military.

438
00:38:59,844 --> 00:39:04,014
Didn't your tour in the army
include some special op in Haiti?

439
00:39:05,974 --> 00:39:06,894
Right.

440
00:39:07,024 --> 00:39:09,024
Special means you don't talk about it.

441
00:39:10,524 --> 00:39:12,564
But I know you've heard
as many horror stories as I have,

442
00:39:12,694 --> 00:39:17,074
about what went on down there
with those death squads.

443
00:39:17,194 --> 00:39:18,324
What were they called?

444
00:39:19,904 --> 00:39:22,324
Tonton Macoutes.

445
00:39:22,454 --> 00:39:25,244
Yeah, "the bogeymen."

446
00:39:27,124 --> 00:39:29,084
They did a lot of terrible things,

447
00:39:29,504 --> 00:39:31,174
killed a lot of people.

448
00:39:35,214 --> 00:39:38,464
They made mothers carry
the heads of their dead sons.

449
00:39:38,594 --> 00:39:41,974
Forced fathers to rape their daughters.

450
00:39:42,094 --> 00:39:44,644
Tied cinder blocks around
people's necks and drowned them

451
00:39:44,764 --> 00:39:48,894
and put mutilated bodies in trees and
killed anybody who tried to take them down.

452
00:39:52,944 --> 00:39:54,614
This man, Jacques Bayard,

453
00:39:56,114 --> 00:39:57,943
if he did those things...

454
00:39:59,403 --> 00:40:01,453
He deserved a lot worse than he got.

455
00:40:08,913 --> 00:40:11,833
Don't worry, James. It'll be over soon.

456
00:40:16,883 --> 00:40:18,253
I know it will.

457
00:40:38,193 --> 00:40:42,323
If Joe was shot up with insulin,
there will be an injection welt...

458
00:40:42,453 --> 00:40:45,163
maybe between his toes or in a freckle.

459
00:40:45,283 --> 00:40:46,873
If it's there, I'll find it.

460
00:40:52,123 --> 00:40:53,753
Small towns.

461
00:41:17,862 --> 00:41:21,322
Come on, Dr. Pittman,
which crematorium did you send Joe to?

462
00:41:41,092 --> 00:41:42,342
Hey! You! Stop!

463
00:41:43,052 --> 00:41:43,882
Come on!

464
00:42:05,702 --> 00:42:06,862
Get in!

465
00:42:16,001 --> 00:42:17,081
Heard you sneak out.

466
00:42:17,791 --> 00:42:22,211
- Took a guess where you were headed.
- Figuring I'd need a ride?

467
00:42:22,341 --> 00:42:27,051
Figured I could talk you out of it.
No such luck, huh?

468
00:42:27,181 --> 00:42:31,051
- Deb will be delighted.
- As far as I know, you went out for a walk.

469
00:42:36,521 --> 00:42:38,231
Jesus, did you steal something?

470
00:42:40,231 --> 00:42:44,611
My fingerprints were all over it. I figured
it was prudent to get rid of the evidence.

471
00:42:44,731 --> 00:42:46,321
It's just a box of ashes.

472
00:42:48,741 --> 00:42:51,701
- Joe was cremated, then.
- Yep.

473
00:42:53,281 --> 00:42:56,541
Guess you weren't able to find out
if he was injected with anything.

474
00:42:56,661 --> 00:42:57,541
No.

475
00:43:00,921 --> 00:43:03,291
- What are you gonna do with him?
- I don't know.

476
00:43:07,421 --> 00:43:08,421
Dumpster?

477
00:43:11,391 --> 00:43:12,721
I have a better idea.

478
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:29,820
You know...

479
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:36,120
No matter what Harry said,
no matter what Deb thinks,

480
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:41,040
- that's your father.
- Cardboard box.

481
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:43,210
I know you don't want to acknowledge it,

482
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:45,540
which is why you're breaking and entering,

483
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:47,840
searching for some killer.

484
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:50,720
But you took that

485
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:53,340
because there's a part of you...

486
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:55,140
that knows that this...

487
00:43:57,310 --> 00:43:58,310
That box...

488
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:01,600
is your real father.

489
00:44:20,329 --> 00:44:21,749
My father.

490
00:44:37,389 --> 00:44:38,929
Sounds strange.

491
00:44:40,729 --> 00:44:42,389
I know.

492
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,368
Oh, hey.

493
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:47,118
- You all right?
- I was just getting some air.

494
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:56,088
I found something in Joe's closet.

495
00:45:56,218 --> 00:46:00,178
It's just a bunch of papers.
They're over there.

496
00:46:14,778 --> 00:46:16,108
Any clues?

497
00:46:26,618 --> 00:46:27,618
Hey, buddy.

498
00:46:28,958 --> 00:46:31,287
- How you feeling?
- Good.

499
00:46:31,417 --> 00:46:33,877
It kind of itches,
but they have ice cream here.

500
00:46:34,757 --> 00:46:36,377
Life's a trade-off.

501
00:46:36,507 --> 00:46:39,337
- What are you making there?
- A thank-you card.

502
00:46:40,427 --> 00:46:43,097
See? The nurse brought me
the crayons and everything.

503
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:44,847
Who's it for?

504
00:46:44,967 --> 00:46:49,977
Well, she said I should thank
the man who gave me the blood.

505
00:46:50,097 --> 00:46:54,567
I mean, that's normal, right,
giving thank-you cards?

506
00:47:00,157 --> 00:47:01,157
Yes, it is.

507
00:47:03,367 --> 00:47:05,037
It's just that he's gone.

508
00:47:05,157 --> 00:47:07,447
And we won't be seeing him again.

509
00:47:08,577 --> 00:47:14,037
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right, it doesn't mean anything.

510
00:47:23,637 --> 00:47:28,017
Yeah, it does. You keep drawing, son.

511
00:47:28,677 --> 00:47:32,307
- I'll make sure it finds him.
- OK.

512
00:47:50,916 --> 00:47:52,616
You had the case dropped?

513
00:47:53,626 --> 00:47:54,876
Excuse me.

514
00:47:58,086 --> 00:47:59,586
IA dropped Doakes' case.

515
00:47:59,716 --> 00:48:02,466
Do you seriously think
I have any say over what IA does?

516
00:48:02,586 --> 00:48:05,886
I put everything on the line.
I told IA the truth,

517
00:48:06,006 --> 00:48:09,466
and there's a lot of evidence to back that up.
What the hell happened?

518
00:48:09,596 --> 00:48:13,846
- Maria, I deserve to know.
- All I know is that IA got a call

519
00:48:13,976 --> 00:48:15,106
from an agency in Washington.

520
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:17,106
- What agency?
- I'm guessing military.

521
00:48:17,226 --> 00:48:20,936
They said the case involves
some sensitive foreign-relations issues...

522
00:48:21,066 --> 00:48:24,236
- so they will handle it from there.
- They disappeared it.

523
00:48:24,366 --> 00:48:27,276
Doakes had a history with them
I figured special forces,

524
00:48:27,406 --> 00:48:30,156
- but this kind of reach...
- You think it was Black Ops, CIA?

525
00:48:30,286 --> 00:48:34,916
Maybe. Probably.

526
00:48:36,126 --> 00:48:39,336
- And I ratted him out. Jesus Christ.
- Angel...

527
00:48:40,256 --> 00:48:41,965
You did what you thought was right.

528
00:48:48,595 --> 00:48:51,805
- Squeak, squeak.
- Do you have a problem?

529
00:48:51,925 --> 00:48:52,925
Officer Benson,

530
00:48:54,725 --> 00:48:56,605
you just bumped into your superior.

531
00:48:58,475 --> 00:49:01,775
I believe you owe Detective Batista
an apology!

532
00:49:04,155 --> 00:49:05,315
Yes, sir.

533
00:49:07,615 --> 00:49:09,155
I'm sorry, sir.

534
00:49:47,774 --> 00:49:51,114
I know I should be sorry
that we met under these circumstances,

535
00:49:51,234 --> 00:49:54,494
but truthfully, I think
it was the best way to get to know you.

536
00:49:58,034 --> 00:50:00,164
Realtor says you won't get much for it.

537
00:50:03,584 --> 00:50:07,464
- Well... more than if I kept it.
- Are we good?

538
00:50:12,594 --> 00:50:13,844
We're fine.

539
00:50:20,054 --> 00:50:23,144
All right. I'll see you back at the station.

540
00:50:39,074 --> 00:50:41,834
Cable repairman.

541
00:50:41,954 --> 00:50:45,584
Wait! Wait! No, no, don't go.

542
00:50:45,714 --> 00:50:46,714
Wait!

543
00:50:47,334 --> 00:50:49,464
Please, I want to ask you something.

544
00:50:51,924 --> 00:50:53,173
Wait!

545
00:50:55,463 --> 00:50:59,263
- Alone again.
- Finally.

546
00:51:02,853 --> 00:51:06,433
You know what?

547
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:10,233
- I'm glad you were here.
- Thought you would be.

548
00:51:16,443 --> 00:51:19,613
The cable repairman...

549
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:23,413
Did he say anything
about my TV antenna?

550
00:52:02,992 --> 00:52:04,742
Rita, it's me.

551
00:52:08,452 --> 00:52:09,372
They're asleep.

552
00:52:09,502 --> 00:52:11,712
Yeah, well, I should have been here, OK?

553
00:52:11,832 --> 00:52:15,252
It's late, you're drunk and you can't
keep coming here unannounced.

554
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:20,172
- You don't call the shots, OK?
- Look, Paul, I want you to leave.

555
00:52:20,302 --> 00:52:22,052
I don't give a fuck what you want.

556
00:52:22,182 --> 00:52:24,932
- I want my fucking kids!
- You're gonna scare them.

557
00:52:25,052 --> 00:52:27,392
They don't want to see me?
They are gonna remember

558
00:52:27,522 --> 00:52:30,982
who the head of this fucking family is. Hey!

559
00:52:32,692 --> 00:52:36,482
You're right. I've been awful.

560
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:38,982
I just didn't realize I was hurting you so much.

561
00:52:39,692 --> 00:52:43,322
But I can make it up to you. Let me try.

562
00:52:58,962 --> 00:53:00,092
Where are you going?

563
00:53:01,422 --> 00:53:03,722
Want to play rough?
Huh? Is that what you want?

564
00:53:03,842 --> 00:53:05,511
No! No!

565
00:53:06,351 --> 00:53:07,601
Fuck you, whore.

566
00:53:07,721 --> 00:53:10,391
Come on. Come on!

567
00:53:20,401 --> 00:53:22,111
Wake up. Wake up. Come on.

568
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:03,571
I had a father...

569
00:54:04,281 --> 00:54:06,911
someone other than Harry
who called me son.

570
00:54:08,241 --> 00:54:11,330
The thought never even occurred to me.

571
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:14,040
Harry was all I needed.

572
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:18,120
It was Harry who always had the answers.

573
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:21,540
He knew who was good, bad, safe...

574
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:24,630
And dangerous.

575
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,970
I built my life on Harry's code.

576
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:29,760
I lived by it.

577
00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:31,970
But Harry lied.

578
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:33,850
Why would he do that?

579
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:36,480
What else don't I know?

580
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:40,270
My concrete foundation is turning
to shifting sand.

581
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,360
Maybe Rudy was right.

582
00:54:42,488 --> 00:54:45,361
You never can truly know anyone.
